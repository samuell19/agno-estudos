Remember. You still have it. I've never taken it off. 1996. You were the most radiantly beautiful, pig-tailed girl in all of Shadowbrook Elementary. Everything changed that year. Why did you wait so long? Why did we wait so long, Ryan? I don't know. I think I was afraid that it might change things, that I might lose you in the end. I don't know if I can do it, if I can watch you go. Here. We have all the time in the world. Believe in me. Yeah, hello? Ryan, it's Geoff. Geoff? You gotta hurry. You gotta hurry. Hello? Ryan, can you hear me? Yeah, Geoff, I can hear you. There's a bomb at the lab. There's some crazy guy. He's got a bomb inside the event chamber. A what? Is Dr. Webb with you? Caitlin. Caitlin? Cate? Hi, this is Dr. Caitlin Webb. I'm not available to take your call right now. Please. Please. Hi, this is Dr. Caitlin Webb... Ryan! Dr. Winrich, thank God. Caitlin. Where is she? Ryan? Ryan, no. - Hey, hey, sir, sir! - Come back here. - Ryan, you can't go in there! - Ryan, wait! I got a code 80, Temporal Science building. Come on. He's goin' up. Warning, warning. Evacuation protocols are now in effect. Please proceed to the emergency exits. Dispatch we are 10-74 on that runner. Hey! Hey, stop right there! Freeze! Terminal lock engaged. It's never gonna be the same now. It's never gonna be the same and it's our fault. - Caitlin. - No. We let him go, Ryan. We were selfish, and now he's gone. I can't do this. Ryan, please don't! You're not gonna stop, are you? I can't stop. Not now, not when we're so close. Nate would never forgive us if we did. He's gone, Ryan. Don't you see where this is going? Bill and now Nate, I can't lose you too. You're all I have left. It's not just about us anymore. Don't you see where this leads? They don't have to die! Once we figure this thing out, there's nothing that says - they have to die, Caitlin! - Ryan, stop and listen to yourself. Our whole lives, everything, everything has led up to this. How can you ask me to turn and walk away? You think that Nate would walk away, or Bill? Think of what they sacrificed! So are you doing this for them, Ryan, or for you? I don't know! I don't know what I'm doing anymore! If I ask you to stop, if I ask you to stop, will you stop? How? How can I? How can I? I can't lose you, Ryan. You won't. We're gonna be together. I promise. Once I finish this. So that's it then? That's your choice? Caitlin. Caitlin. Power up the portal. We have work to do. Warning, warning, accelerator activation sequence initiated. Nate gave us the clue. Analysis of the portal after the accident showed a transport over 75 years' time. He solved the pulse resonance problem by altering the number of dimensions in the equation. So he was right all along. Now all that's left for us to do is to stabilize the carrier frequency so the tissue samples stay viable upon re-entry. If we can do that... What are you standing around for? Let's make it happen. Emergence successful. Cellular cohesion intact. Quantum incoherence nominal. Tachyon syncopation achieved. So, did we do it? We'll know in a moment. It worked. There's only one thing left to do. Good luck, Edward. Warning, warning! Biological organism detected. Do you wish to override safety protocols? Here we go. Delivering payload in five, four, three, two, one. Delivery successful. Processing. Emergence in seven, six, five, - four, three, two, one. - Come on, damnit, come on. Specimen cohesion intact. Quantum incoherence nominal. Tachyon syncopation achieved. We did it. He checks out, everything. You really did it. We did it. All of us. - Oh. - Yeah. They would be proud. Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Webb, Dr. Winrich, in honor of this momentous occasion... Success! - Wow. - That one's for you. How did you sneak this in here, you two? I might have hidden it in my lab coat. A toast, what are we toasting? To Nobel Prizes by the bucket loads. - Nobel Prizes! - Cheers. To Nathan. And to Nathan. - To Nathan. - To Nathan. And to Edward, the time-traveling mouse. And to Edward, to Edward. To Edward. Wait, wait, hold on a second. Yeah, no. I think you're a little young. He is too young. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Come on, drink it! Look at you, you're already wasted. See that? You're a sloppy drunk. What are we gonna say? We are gonna get in trouble, you guys. We'll tell them it's a celebration. - Excuse me. - I don't know, I don't know. Can't believe this little guy, what a journey! Edward, Edward's my hero! Aw, he's sleeping! - Dr. Winrich! - Dr. Winrich! Dr. Winrich! Tell us about the discovery! Dr. Winrich, is it true? Is it true you sent a living creature through the time portal? Dr. Winrich, will you be the first man to travel through time? What does this mean for the future of mankind? Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Someone leaked it to the press. No comment, no comment! Over here, Dr. Winrich. Ladies and gentlemen... Are you ready, buddy? It is with great pleasure that I present to you the Quantum 42. The world's first temporal manipulation portal. Are we having fun yet? I could get used to this. And now, if you would all take your positions, we can begin the demonstration. Portal activation sequence initiated. Actuating reactor cores. Spooling feedback generators. The portal is now active. The emergence timer is set for 10 seconds, meaning that we will be sending the object 10 seconds into the future. Then, 10 seconds after entering the event horizon, it will re-emerge from the other side. It's worth noting that only non-conductive materials can traverse the portal due to the high energy requirements of maintaining the field. Any conductive metals would cause the portal to lose stability and collapse. What would happen to all of that energy if the portal did collapse, theoretically? It would dissipate exponentially, which is why we have taken the precaution of sealing the event chamber. This state-of-the-art blast-proof facility can withstand up to 80 terajoules of thermonuclear pressure, the equivalent of an atomic bomb. Atomic bomb? Good analogy. Pre-delivery cycle complete. Delivering payload in eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Delivery successful. Awaiting tachyon syncopation telemetry. Processing. Emergence in seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Moment of truth. Ladies and gentlemen, you have just witnessed time travel. Here we go. Dr. Winrich, Larry Fincher, "Science Journal America." Oh, hi, Larry. Your previous experiments in temporal physics utilized much smaller particle accelerators. What are you boys using to power this monster? - Um... - Well, Larry, you know, that's a damn good question. Since I like damn good questions, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Follow me. Poor Larry. Okay, game face. - Hi! - Hi. Larry, welcome to J Lab E99117 Alpha, also known as Big Bertha. Now, this is what you might call an atomic feedback generator. Basically, it's a big-ass nuclear battery that can exponentially amplify the atomic energy output generated by the atom smashers. Yeah, boys at NASA can't wait to get their hands on this one. And all the feedback here is internal to the system, and all the load-bearing circuitry feeds directly into the event chamber. So, in the case of any unfortunate accident, the discharge would be completely pacified by the gravimetric fields generated by the portal. Well, sounds like you guys have taken every precaution. So tell me, you don't think there's any risk of, oh, say... ripping a permanent hole in space-time with this thing? Because as I understand, that would be the inevitable outcome if toying with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle equations, which, as far as I can tell, is exactly what you guys are doing here. Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry. As much power as it takes to create a sustained temporary rift, it's nothing compared to what is required to produce a permanent self-sustaining black hole in our universe, Lare. Come on. Trust me. We're safe as bugs in rugs. Now, Big Bertha's connected solely to the event chamber. The rest of the lab runs on city power. Yeah. Is that really them? Them they are, Lare, the very first objects ever successfully sent through the portal four years ago at this very university. Yeah. You know, any time anyone accuses me of losing my marbles, I make sure I bring 'em in here. Let's go check out those sweet robot arms, eh? - We're very grateful. - Yeah, thank you. You guys have been just, just amazing. It's so important to have credible science journalism these days. Your piece on the Higgs was almost prophetic. We really can't thank you enough. Ghost? Uh... Huh? You look like you've seen one. No, I'm just tired, I guess. Okay, well, this probably isn't helping. Yeah. We can get out of here if you want, go get a piece of pie somewhere. Nate'll cover for us. It's all happening, the way Bill said it would. It's almost like he knew, you know? Well, he was right about you. You're going to change the world, Ryan Winrich. I have a feeling about you. What kind of feeling? Hey, there you are, my two favorite people in time and space! Did you miss me as much as I missed me? Well, it's highly improbable. So, now for the big question, how long till you guys send a person through this thing? Well, Larry, we could tell you that information, but then we would have to kill you, and I don't wanna kill you, Larry. I like you, but I will let you in on one more secret we have here at the lab. Here, come on. No fillings. Just sayin'. All right, one more thing. How does it feel to be the top names in science since Albert Einstein? Um, well, actually, Einstein once said that it's strange to be so well-known, and yet, still be so lonely. Yeah, well, Dr. Nathan Beaumont once said, "Fuck Einstein." Yeah, and hold on to the hair plugs, Lare, 'cause you ain't seen nothin' yet. Yeah, you better drink that down. How's your head? I stole his sunglasses as punishment for his bad attempt at karaoke last night. Revenge is a cruel bitch. I think you mean fate. Yeah, I think I do. Choose faith! Choose faith! Never, ever again. So understand this. Man does not have dominion over time. God has given man dominion over the Earth... That's right. But time transcends man's stewardship of this world. Science has finally gone too far and encroached - where it does not not belong. - Oh, encroached, well. Hold on, you guys, that's Abner Rosen. Who? That is the bully from Shadowbrook Elementary School. It's Abner Rosen, look! - Holy shit! - Hear me, - brothers and sisters. - Literally. Ladies and gentlemen, the disciples of Satan! We should go. - Yeah. - Come on. - Repent, sinners! - Repent! Repent! Repent, sinners! I got some repentance for you - right here, jackass! - Nathan! Nate! - Good morning, hi! - Nate, don't! Good morning, Dr. Nate Beaumont, scientist. Okay, what have we here? Let me guess. Science comes from the devil, am I right? Yeah. - Yeah. - That's right. Yeah, evolution is a lie, right? Jesus rode a dinosaur and the Earth is flat. Is that about the gist of the conversation that we're having here today? Science does come from the devil, sir. Ah, see. And is meant to mislead us... Just let it go. - From our righteousness. - Yeah, mm-hmm. If you weren't so blinded by your smug, elitist arrogance, you would see just how cleverly Satan has pulled the wool over your eyes. - Okay, that's it. - Hey. I've heard enough. Nate, come on. I'm gonna go ahead and forget my one ass kick per customer rule, just today, just for you, douchebag. Nate! - Huh? - Come on! The cowardice of science. Do not tempt the laws of providence! Use what time you have left and beg for his forgiveness! Keep drinkin' the Kool-Aid, Abby! Do not give in to the shadow demons of your science. Failure, protein breakdown detected. Dammit! Code 46682. Exit wave syncopation lost. Molecular cohesion lost. I don't get it. I just don't get it. The organic material should retain stability now. Just doesn't make any sense. Take a break, bro. I'm not the only one that had more than a few drinks last night. Where is it breaking down? I don't know, somewhere in the pulse resonance. Okay, every atom in the universe resonates at a frequency specific to its time and place. When we put matter through the portal, we're sending it out of sync with the universe, and that doesn't affect inorganic material. - Like the marbles. - Exactly. But living tissue can't survive because of the strain of the membranes on an atomic level. Okay, okay. So it's out of sync with the flow of energy from the new timeline when it re-enters. Exactly, but this equation should correct for the change in electromagnetic force. So why isn't it working? We've been running the same experiment for hours. It's not the same experiment. Yeah, okay, well, virtually same experiment. I'm gonna switch things up a little bit. Hey, Nate, I thought we agreed not to liquefy any more mice until we'd worked out the kinks. Bella. You two aren't the only geniuses in the room, you know. Let's have a little faith. - Interesting. - What? Instead of altering the resonance on emergence... We alter it upon entry into the portal. Then we can use exit wave to re-adjust and correct for any discrepancies. That's brilliant. Timer set at 10 seconds. Delivery in five, four, three, two, one. Delivery successful. Processing. It'll work. Emergence in five, four, three, two, one. Yeah! Delivery cycle complete. Way to go, Nate! Attention, error detected. Oh, no. What? Warning. Sample stability in extremis. Protein breakdown, quantum coherence breakdown. Molecular cohesion failure. Unable to compensate. Dammit! We'll get there. We'll look at the numbers again and maybe we'll find somethin'. Shit! Claudia, let's get that under a microscope and see what we can learn from it. Sorry, Geoff. Poor Geoffrey. Poor Geoffrey? Poor Bella. You guys know they call them lab rats for a reason, right? Nice. All right then, a toast. To Bella, mouse of science. Long may she dine on the giant cheese wheel in the sky. Nice. Aw, come on, guys! We're gettin' there, all right? Today was just another step, on the pathway to eventual success. I think somebody needs to lay off his euphemisms for a while. I think somebody's got a pretty good hold on his euphemisms, okay? You all right? I was just thinkin' about Bill. I miss him, you know, on days like today. We all do. Yeah. You know, I actually kinda envy Bill a little bit... - Hey, hey, hey... - You know? I think someone's reached their limit. No, I'm serious, you guys. Bill finally figured out the answer to the greatest mystery of all. What lies beyond. I guess we all figure that one out sooner or later, huh? Hey, a toast. A toast to our friend and our mentor, Bill Marshall. I think he'd be proud. To Bill. Bill. And on that note, gentlemen, I am going to take a powder and hit the road. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - No, no. We have an early morning, I don't wanna... Wait, wait, you haven't ordered dessert. - Dessert. - Dessert! - Come on, come on. - If there's one thing I've learned about Dr. Caitlin Webb, in the 16 years since I've known her, she never goes without dessert. This is true. - When she can order dessert. - Mm-hmm. Unless there's an annoying drunk idiot at the table, so... - Oh, Nate, come on! - No, Nate! - Nate, come on! - I will take my leave, - and I will hail a cab. - Look, I'll take you home. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You kids have fun, okay? I'll see ya in the morning, bright and early... ish, you know. Let me know what happens. You call me if you need anything, all right? I will not call you. Good old Nate. Good old Nate. Miskatonic University, driver. Don't spare the whip. So... So? I got nothin'. You know what's funny is I don't actually think I can remember the last time we were alone together. That'd be November 4th, 2004. - Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Yeah. It was election night, and everybody went out to down their sorrows. And they left us alone in the lab, minding some experiment or something, and I remember sitting there, watching you work, and you were so meticulous, so intense. And then when you finally did notice me, I totally freaked and I dropped the stack of test slides - all over the floor... - Oh! - It shattered everywhere. - You cut your finger on the... Yeah, right there, still have the scar. Oh, my gosh. Dr. Beaumont? It's late. It is late! Very late, Geoffrey. It's very late in the hour. Hello, Dr. Beaumont. Terminal encryption active. Nate, is there anything I can help you with or? Eh, afraid not, Doogie. Not tonight. Accelerator activation sequence initiated. Oh, my God. You know, Ryan, this would change everything. You know, Bill once told me most people live life between the moments, never really seeing what's right in front of them until the moment is gone. He said, "Ryan, "it's easy to be afraid. "But if you can face your fear in the moment, "everything else becomes clear." It's the lab. Oh. Yeah, this is Ryan. Dr. Winrich? We have a situation. He won't unlock the door and it's not responding. It's frozen or locked, or... What's he doing? Access denied, access denied, access denied, access denied. Warning! Biological organism detected. I think it's high time for human trials, boys and girls! Accelerator activation sequence complete. Caution! Safety protocols disengaged. Nathan, Nathan, get out of there! Nathan! For God's sake, what are you doing? Safety protocol failure. Unable to override. He's overridden the doors from the mainframe. I can't get it open. Hey, let me try. Hey! Hey, it's the lovebirds! Hey, listen, listen, I made some adjustments to the signal resonator. It's good! Perfectly safe now. Communication channel active. Nathan, just come outta there and we'll go over those changes together, okay? We'll think this thing through. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I got this, brother! I solved it, okay? We're good, I figured this out! And to prove it to you, and to show you how sure I am, I, Nathan Charles Beaumont, am gonna step into the unknown, and become the world's first time traveler! I'm sorry, Cate. I beat you to it. Nate, sweetie, look at me, okay? You had a lot to drink tonight, okay, and we're not gonna do this now, not like this, okay? It's not safe. Nate, please don't do this, Nate! Ryan, do something! Terminal encryption active. Access denied. Dammit! Ryan, come on! I'll see you soon. - Nathan! - No! Delivery successful. Emergence in seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And that's all he said? That's all he said. Had he ever exhibited any behavior that could be interpreted as suicidal before this? No. Do you think he purposely intended to end his life? I don't know, no. I don't know. Detective, we have some information. Excuse me. What was he thinking? What were you thinking? That was the lab. The substance is human remains. The blood type appears to match that of Dr. Beaumont's. I'm sorry. I think I have enough here for tonight. We can get the rest in the morning. Dr. Winrich, if I may for a moment. Sure. Hang on, okay? Okay. Yeah? Just outta curiosity and for the record, how old was Dr. Beaumont? He's 28. Why? The lab boys say the cellular decay of the substance in that room was over 75 years old. Any idea how that could be? Transferring feed to the resonator now. All right, Caitlin, gently. That's it, you got it. Almost there. Power's as steady as she's gonna be. Resonating at 22.5. The portal should be active. All right, Mr. Winrich, it's in your hands now! Three, two, one. 10 seconds exactly! Yes, yes! - Yes! - Yes! You did it, buddy! - You did it, buddy! - We did it! - We made a time machine! - We did it! We put the marbles through time! Yeah, we built a time machine! We built a time machine! They went to the future. Bill, Bill, we did it! Bill, what's wrong? What is it? No, Bill! Call 9-1-1. - What happened? - Call 9-1-1 now! Go! Finish it. No, hang on, hang on. Please. Please! - Nathan. - They're on their way. What do we do? It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay. Shh. We got you. We got you. Dr. Channard. The new arrival is awake and appears very distressed. I just keep thinking how much I owe him. I mean, I don't even know who I'd be if it weren't for him. It's gonna be all right, you guys. Do you remember the first time we met? A bunch of nerdy misfit kids, and he brought us together. God, it seems like yesterday. It's 13 years ago. 13 good years. Yeah. I'm sorry. It was his heart. I'm very sorry. Ryan! What is it, what's the matter? Nothing. Everything's okay, Mom. Are you sure? Yeah, just go back to sleep. Okay. Okay. Bill was a rare individual. He was a teacher, a mentor, and a good friend. He was the kinda person that made you want to be more than you thought you could be. And if you were lucky enough to listen when he spoke about the wonders of this universe around us, your entire perspective on life, on everything, would be forever changed. I never knew my real father. But I'd like to think, I'd like to think that Bill knew that I always wished that it coulda been him. He made me what I am today, and I will always thank him for that. As from the heavens we came, so to the heavens do we return. From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust. I think Dad would have really liked Bill. Wherever he is, I'm sure Dad's very proud, Ryan, of all you've been able to do. Come on. Dean Foster's looking for you at the house. Hey, you all right, bro? No, no. I need to talk to you, Ryan. Yeah, yeah, sure. I have to talk to the dean real quick. No, now, Ryan. I need to talk to you now, okay? Nathan Charles Beaumont, that was a beautiful eulogy. Thanks. I remember when you were in the eighth grade. You were terrified of public speaking. There was a particular humanities class... - Caitlin. - Hey. - Ryan. - Dean Foster. Good of you to come. William was a good friend, Ryan, and you kids, you meant everything to him, you know that. Oh, he was the best. William was a rare breed. He taught school not because he had to, but because he loved it. And when he talked about you three, you should have seen the gleam in his eye. It's a rare thing of joy, that sense of accomplishment a professor gets when he realizes that one of his students has truly surpassed him. And with you three, well, I know for a fact that he thought of you as family. What you may not know is that Bill had a sizable savings. Old money. But he didn't touch a cent of it. He was setting it aside for your research, and he left specific instructions. It's true, isn't it, about your recent success? Yes. Then with your blessing, we're going to write a new chapter in the history of Miskatonic University, starting with the construction of the William Marshall School of Temporal Sciences, a new wing devoted to your groundbreaking work, and Bill's enduring legacy. I don't know what to say. Thank you. Say Einstein! Explain it again, Bill. Yeah, why does the current seem to jump up when it reaches the end of the line? Well, we know that when the spark fires, it ionizes the air around it, right? And we know that heated air rises, which is what the spark follows as it moves up the line. So it follows the ionized trail past the top until it's dissipated to the point that it can't maintain the spark. Yes, good, good, Ryan. Check out the arc light over there. It operates on the same principal. I'll be at my desk. Hey, Ryan. I finished all the books you gave me. All of 'em? What else you got? Why! What else, huh? Hmm. Yes, yes, yes. I think I have just the thing. Some books are very special, Ryan. Some books can change your life. You think you're ready for it? I was about your age when I first read Wells. Opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on that book, Mr. Winrich. Thanks, Bill. Thanks. You're welcome. Ryan, wait up! Oh, hey. You know, Ryan, there's more to life than just books and science projects. Uh-huh, such as? Uh, such as a certain total hottie that we both know who never stops staring at you. Incoming hottie. Hey, what's up? We were just talkin' about you. What about me? Nothin', nothin' at all. And how are you today? Aced the geometry quiz, I'm bettin'. Hi, Ryan. Hi. Oh, yeah, totally ignore this prime specimen of manhood and focus on the nerd. I see how it is. So I was talkin' to Howard Phillips at lunch today, and apparently, his little sister got so mad at him for trading in her Barbie video game, she put dog shit - in his lunchbox. - Ew. That is gross! No, she actually put it inside his Twinkie! Can you believe that? You know, it's good to be an only child. Do you have any brothers or sisters, Ryan? No, how 'bout you? Sometimes I wish I had a little sister, someone to play with or dress up, or have a birthd..., uh. What, what's wrong? I left something back at school. I have to go back. We're halfway home, just leave it till tomorrow! I can't, okay? Ryan, tell me you'll wait for me. - We're not waiting. - Tell me you'll wait. Make him wait! Women. Hey. I thought only the scum of the school had to stay after class. Wouldn't have pegged Caity Webb for a bad girl. What do you want? Caity the bad girl wants to know what I want. What do you got? Nothing! What's this? It's nothing! If it's nothing you won't miss it. Give it! What's going on? Hey, hey, it's my favorite dork! Are you okay? What do you care, dork? She's not your girlfriend, dork. Whatcha readin', dork? Stop it! What is going on in here? Miss Webb? Abner took my box. Mr. Rosen, back to detention now! You two, head home. What a jerk. It's not that bad. Here. It's for you. Bill told me it was your birthday today. Yeah, I wasn't really gonna tell anyone. I'm not that big of a birthday person. Open it. You seem sad a lot. Maybe this will help you forget the bad times and remember the good ones. It's cool. A-hem, what the hell is this, the Love Boat? I've been waitin' down at the corner like a schmuck! Come on, let's go, it's gonna be dark soon. Jesus! I wanna hear all about this later, okay, Romeo? Where's Nate? I don't know. He'll catch up. So. So. Do you want me to carry your backpack for you, or anything? No, I got it. Okay. Okay. It's quiet without Nate. Yeah, it's different. Yeah, it's kinda nice though. Yeah. Yeah. How 'bout we go through the park today? Yeah, sounds good to me. I got an idea. Let's race! What? Hey! Come on, this way! Let me go! Yeah, man! Ryan! Let go of me! Stay there. I still want my present, Caity. You got a present for me, bad girl? 'Cause I got a present for you. How 'bout you give me my present when I'm done with your dork boyfriend? How's that? Get him up. Come on, hit me, come on, hit me! - Hit me! - Kill him! - Abner, hit him! - Come on, man! Come on! Hit me, pussy! - Kick his ass! - Come on, man! Stop! Ryan! Stop! Hey, asshole! I got this. Come on. You all right? Yeah. Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm gonna get you. One day. Your friends won't always be there! Oh, I'll be there. This was fun. We should do it again some time. You're crazy. Well, this is me. Thanks for walkin' me home. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I'm gonna go scrub my face with engine cleaner to make sure I get all his disgustingness off of me. Don't forget about Bill's surprise party on Sunday! All right, see ya! See ya! Bye. Well, thanks. - For what? - For what? I don't know, saving my life? Abner Rosen's a douchebag. Someone needed to stick it to him. Well, I owe you one. Well, in that case, you could hook me up with one of Caitlin's hot friends. I'm seriously dyin' over here. She likes you, you know? I can sense these things. We're just friends. Okay, okay. So you think Bill suspects anything? I don't know, I guess we'll find out on Sunday. Guess we will. - Surprise! - Oh, my! Happy birthday, Bill! What a nice surprise! Thank you. Sit down, sit down, we have a present for you. Okay, what is this? - It's from all of us. - Look at this! We all built it... But it was Ryan's idea. Oh, it's beautiful. Classic. That's just some notes I took on those books you gave me. You know, so maybe we could build a time machine of our own some day, a real one. This is fantastic. Thank you! Thank you so much. You are the most talented and gifted students I've ever had. I mean that, and I thank you. This is wonderful, a wonderful surprise. - Happy birthday! - Birthday! You gotta make a wish now. - Make a wish. - Okay, okay. Mm, what's my wish? Gail: All right! Very good! You gotta tell us your wish now. Tell us your wish! - Tell us your wish! - Tell us your wish, tell us... No, no, you don't wanna know my wish. - You gotta tell us. - Please! I can't, it won't come true. Okay, okay, all right. My wish, my hope is that the three of you stay together. You're a great team, and together, you can accomplish anything. So let's have some cake. - Yeah, let's have some cake. - Let's have cake! - Let's eat some cake. - Thank you! - Happy birthday, Bill. - Happy birthday. Thank you, thank you so much. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Okay, Ryan, I got your favorite! Ah, here, it comes, man! - Happy birthday, honey. - All right!

He's gettin' smart, I'm proud of you. ♪ 12 years ago today ♪ You know, Ryan, it's okay if you wanna watch these old videos. I don't mind. And if you wanna talk about it, we can talk about anything you want. I, uh, I miss Dad. You miss Dad? Yeah, I wish he was still here. I miss him too, Ryan. And you know that wherever he is, he's always watchin' out for us. And I'm sure that he wouldn't let anything bad happen to us, as long as we keep him in our hearts. I think I'm gonna walk today. You know, I could drive you. It's okay. But I like to drive you. You can't always protect me, Mom. You just can't. You remember last week, we talked about the problem of Achilles and the tortoise. This was a problem that arose around 450 B.C., with the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea. Zeno developed these thought experiments as a way to show the inherent problems of Pythagorean philosophy. So who can tell me, what do we call these types of logic problems? Ryan Winrich. Um. What was the question? Dork! I can see someone has his head in the clouds this morning. No, I was just, uh. What a dork! Here, go to the nurse. Okay. Hey, Mom, did you open my...? Ryan, you remember Dr. Matheson from church. So how's school, Ryan? It's fine. Got a cut on your lip. Is there some trouble you wanna tell me about? Not really. Okay. I see. Do you know why your mom asked me to talk to you today? Well, she's concerned about you. She feels like you don't communicate with her the way you used to, before the accident. Got somethin' I'd like to show you, if I could. Seen that picture before? It's my picture. How do you feel when you look at that picture? I miss him. Who? Who do you miss? My dad. Is he the only one you miss? What do you mean? In that photo. Yeah, I guess. Has there been any word about the body? Nothing. It just disappeared, and they can't explain it. These things take time. The memories may come back, they may not. It was an incredibly traumatic event, and his mind is young and fragile. He may subconsciously choose to block it out forever. He doesn't even remember his own... Now, try not to worry. Just be strong, Gail. You and Ryan will be just fine. Get off! I asked you a question, dork! Do you bring or buy? Check it. Nothin'. Perfect, I prefer cash. Get off! - Nice! - Yeah! Looks like we got dork's lunches for the whole week right here. What's this? "Have a good day at school today, Ryan. "Love, Mom." - Aw! - That's so cute. You havin' a good day, shithead? 'Cause I know I am. Pleasure doin' business with you, dumbass! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy! They can't hurt you. Don't worry. You're safe now. Wha...? Is this the first time you've seen 'em? My name's Bill Marshall. What's yours? Ryan. Ryan Winrich. Well, Ryan, um, I'm headed home, how 'bout you? Maybe we should walk together just to be safe, huh? So what were those things anyway? Well, they're kinda hard to explain. There's a lot about 'em we don't know. Mostly, they're just observers, watchers, you know? Lurkers, I call 'em. They're from a different place, different space, and they check in on our world from time to time. Like in "Flatland." What? Good Lord! I didn't read Abbott till I was in grad school. Yeah, my dad gave it to me before he died. I see. But yeah, yeah, like in "Flatland," except they don't interact directly. They just observe the natural events in our time-space continuum. At least, that's what we think. Who's we? Those of us who can see them and want to understand them. You know, Ryan, I learned the hard way that sometimes it's best not to tell people you can see something that they can't. You know what I'm saying? I saw the item in your pocket earlier, and I know that we just met, but is there anything you want to talk to me about? I just... I almost made a mistake. That's all. Good man. Ryan, where have you been? The school called, I have been worried sick! Mrs. Winrich, I'm Bill Marshall. I'm a professor at Miskatonic University, and I'm a new friend of your son's. He's had a pretty rough day. Are you okay? Go inside and get cleaned up. Thank you for your help, Mr. Marshall. Mrs. Winrich, may I have a word, please? Forgive me if I'm out of line by saying this, but you have a very gifted boy. I wonder if you realize how gifted he is? He's also a very troubled boy, Mr. Marshall. I know, I know, believe me, I understand. I teach a class at the university for exceptionally bright and troubled kids, and I think Ryan would be right at home with the boys and girls in my class. I just want what's best for him. That's all I want, Mr. Marshall. Please, call me Bill. Anyway, those are the questions that I thought might work. Okay, well, you know, I think if you reduce one or two of them, then yeah, this first one looks a little difficult. I'd simplify a little bit. Once simplified, they should be able to do it, - no problem. - Okay. - It shouldn't take any time. - Thank you. - Okay, sure. - I'll talk to you soon. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Hey, Ryan, good to see you, man. You ready? Come on in. Take a deep breath. It's gonna be good. Come on! Nathan, Caitlin, this is Ryan. He's gonna be joining us for a while. Nice to meet you. It's called the Wimshurst machine. It's an electrostatic generator. Is it dangerous? Don't touch the current, but you can give it a try. Just turn that crank right there. We were just about to start a game before class. You wanna join us? Yeah, sure. So this game's called Cathedral. This is the first piece you start out with, and you put all these pieces around it. You wanna get the most points. Each piece is worth 10 points. Person with the most points wins. I'll start. Nice move! I'll go here. No fair! I didn't know you could do that move! Okay, since you didn't know about it, I'll take it back, but next time I do it, it's gonna be fair, okay? Okay, thanks, Ryan! Okay, Ryan, I want your sister in bed at nine. Okay. Emma, listen to your big brother. - He's in charge, okay? - Kay. Now, be good, no wild parties. I will, I won't. Oh, and please don't eat a ton of junk food. I will know what's missing. - Okay. - See you in the morning! - Good night, I love you, bye! - Night, love you. Bye. Here he comes now. I'm getting out of here! No! Johnny! Help me, help! What happened? At the window - someone's at the window! Are you sure? I saw him looking in. I'm scared. Emma, go upstairs. Ryan, is that you? Don't answer it, Ryan! Who is it? I said who is it? A friend. Pick up the phone and dial 9-1-1. I'm not gonna hurt you, all right? Just , just calm down! Just calm down, okay! No, no, Ryan! Ryan, listen to me, this is important, okay? I have to talk to you, Ryan. I have to tell you what's going to happen. Very soon, you're going to invent something, an incredible machine that allows you to travel through time. But you can't let it happen, you understand? You can't make it, that's what they want. That's how they get in. That's how it begins. They're not watchers. They want this world for their own. I've seen what those things can do. They get into your subconscious. They manipulate everything! You have to fight them, Ryan! You have to resist! I don't have any time! You gotta listen to me, I'm jumping! I'm jumping like the marbles! I'm unstuck in time! I've been trying to find you for 13 years! I've been trying to find you for 13 years. You have to remember what I am saying to you, Ryan. You have to stop them! No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, God, no! No. No, no, Ryan! Ryan, I didn't, I-I-I didn't know. Ryan? Ryan! Ryan, wait! Please, Ryan, listen to me! It's okay. I'll always be here. Remember. It's like there's a hole in his mind. You have to remember what I am saying to you, Ryan! It was an incredibly traumatic event. He may subconsciously choose to block it out forever. He doesn't even remember his own sister! Have you seen that picture before? I miss him. Who? Who do you miss? Dad. Is he the only one you miss? What do you mean? In that photo. Happy birthday, Ryan! Mostly, they're just observers, lurkers, they call 'em. They don't interact directly. They just observe the natural events in our time-space continuum. They're not watchers. They want this world for their own. I've seen what those things can do. They get into your subconscious, they manipulate everything! That's how they get in. That's how it begins. It's for you. Maybe this will help you forget the bad times and remember the good ones. You still have it. I've never taken it off. Some books are very special, Ryan. Some books can change your life. Come on, hit me! Come on! Hit me, pussy! Our whole lives, everything, everything has led up to this! How can you ask me to turn and walk away? Finish it. There's a bomb. A what? In the lab, there's some crazy guy. He's got a bomb - inside the event chamber. - Caitlin. You have to fight them, Ryan! You have to resist! Warning! Warning! Safety protocols disengaged. Attention! Blast door lock release sequence failure. Unable to override. It's time. Remote activation sequence enabled. Portal activation sequence initiated. Danger! Danger! Safety protocol failure. Human life in extremis. Hold on. Access denied, access denied. He picked me. God picked me. Access denied, terminal override, unable to comply. This is God's will, and I am his messenger. This is God's will. This is God's will. This is how it ends. This is God's will and I am his messenger. This is how the world is supposed to end! This is how the world is supposed to end! This is how the world ends! Activation sequence complete. Terminal override accepted. Releasing blast doors in five, four, three, two, one.. Three, five, three, four. Remote activation sequence enabled. Override activation sequence initiated. - Surprise! - This was fun. We should do it again some time. The world's first temporal manipulation... You're going to change the world, Ryan Winrich. - I have a feeling about you. - What kind of feeling? She likes you, you know. I can sense these things. Your friends won't always be there! Oh, I'll be there! I'll always be here. It's for you. Maybe this will help you forget the bad times and remember the good ones. Any conductive metals would cause the portal to lose stability and collapse. This is how the world ends! Most people live life between the moments, never truly seeing what's right in front of them, until the moment is gone. It's easy to be afraid. But if you can face the moment, everything else becomes clear. Remember. GARBAGE'S "TIME WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING" PLAYS
