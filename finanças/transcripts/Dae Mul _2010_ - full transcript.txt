How is it, Your Excellency? Yes, this indeed the taste. Because of this taste, so I have no choice but to abduct you to Cheong Wa Dae. Your Excellency... I heard Prosecutor He was injured. How is he right now? Nothing serious, he is fine now. Have been boiling ox horn soup to supplement his loss, so he is much better now.

But, for you being so busy to show concern about my son. I am really grateful, Your Excellency. It is really delicious. The food is turning cold. Don't feel restricted. Eat it while it is hot. How is it? - It is really good. - Very delicious. Miss Seo Hye-Rim, does it suit your appetite. Yes. Because it is what we used to eat at home. So it reminds me of my Mother's home cook food. Let's eat to our fill. Then, we will continue to work hard! Although, during the process of the election there will be many difficulties. I hope that after you are elected. You can put in the same effort as this bowl of oxtail soup. Touching people with your politics. Although, I know I am inadequate in many ways. I will do my very best, Mr. President. You will end up an independent candidate. At the Nam-Song District running for the election. I am sorry, Representative Minister. Mr. Kang Tae-San Congress Member, removed me from People Friends Party public recommended list. All roads eventually lead you to Rome. Just like the situation before you became a Member. To stand for election without party affiliation. Leave an impression, so that even if you have to get in Legislative Council first to enter into Congress. Do you know what I mean? Thank you, Representative Minister. After I am elected, I will be loyal to you. As Kim Tae-Bong Secretary in control of Kim Tae-Bong's trust. It should not be a problem. You are as closely related to my family. I brought the election letters. People Friend Party's HBS host born, Seo Hye-Rim is the No. 1 Candidate. Do-Ya, I came. Why does Sister keep looking at me like that? It is so annoying. I just went to Cheong Wa Dae. After eating Uncle's oxtail soup, I came back. Uncle is very worried about you. Heard you removed your stitches. How is your body? Sister. What is your real purpose for running the election campaign? When I was struggling with the mosquities, you told me to go run for election campaign. That was meant as a joke. I don't know what that Kang Tae-San used to persuade you. Do you think with 2 or 3 million, you can go into politics? Requires a lot of money. Campaign fees also. Plan to use Dong-Ho's Father company relief fund? To pay for the campaign fees. What? Sister, you are crazy. Sooner or later you become a beggar. Looks like this will not do. Sister, you better migrate to Australia. I will not escape again. After being a Congress Member. I will protect just like Dong He's father did. Reclamation land that nobody bothers. So you must quickly recover. To identify the criminal that tried to kill you. Mommy, Fighting! Eh, Fighting! The car is ready. Let's move out, Candidate Seo. Today is the first day. I better walk to the Party Office. Yes, then let's do it that way. Mom, do not worry. Go into the house first. Quickly, go. They are waiting for you. No. 1, Candidate Seo Hye-Rim. I am going. - Miss Seo Hye-Rim, Hello. - Hello. Yes, Seo Hye-Rim. Sister, Fighting! Thank you! You be late for classes. Quickly, go to school. Must be because she is a public figure. So the reaction is not the same. Getting support from kids who do not even have the right to vote. What is the use? Hello. I am Candidate Seo Hye-Rim. Please look after me. Miss Seo you better return. Eh? I wasn't talking to you. Yes, I was talking to Miss Seo. What are you doing? That is considered sexual harassment. This is all counted in the tea charges. Isn't it, Miss Seo? That is just the basic. And there are more rewards. I am going. The sky will not fall down. Please sit down. - Yes. - Please sit. What must I do now? Please invite us to drink rice wine. Eh? It is not even 10am. Elections in the country is won by on treating others. We will be waiting for you in the hotel in front, please then. - Let's go. - Go. I do not know as a widow. What courage are you using to stand for election. If you came just to look around. Then go back. This is because you look like my daughter. So I am reminding you. Secretary General. Elections are all like this. I am sorry, Candidate Seo. Are they all Kim Tae-Bong Congress Member's men? So, they will be very critical in the beginning. But when the election campaign starts, things will get better. How about we cleaned the area for hygiene? Since there is nothing to do, Secretary General. Brat. Your six abdominal muscles because of that wound had become seven abdominal muscles. You still have mood to joke around. Hey, lucky you are single. And your body is strong. That, late night if it was a women. Or like me, a Father with several daughters. Being stabbed by that knife, what to do? District Director! To someone who nearly died. District Director, how can you say such things? Criminal drove away in the car. The car being burnt into a scrap metal. Was discovered on a road by the Country side. And did not leave any traces on the knife. Even if U.S. CSI Team come here, they will not be able to catch him. The criminals will be caught. Do you know who the criminals are? Who else? Who is the person who will benefit most if I am killed? That defeated guy who is unable to kill me. Brat. Do you think there are only one or two of that kind of guys in the Republic of Korea? The guys you arrest every year, there are at least about a hundred of them. Yes, the Cowboy Incident, Woo Congress Member. And Lee Bae-Ho will certainly hate you as if you are his itchy teeth. I already said it is not me, Prosecutor He. I know, friend. Then, why am I handcuffed? Article 68 of the Road Traffic charges. Prohibited Acts on the road. Traffic safety facilities were damaged. 3 years in prison or a fine of 7 million. To demonstrate social discontent. The cost of that action is no joke. Let me see. Damaged more than a hundred street lights. Value of each bulb is 25,000. Value of each fuse is 50,000. Total of 7.5 million. 3 days required to install street lights. 1.05 million to leased installation vehicles. Hire two people per 150,000. 3 days, that is like 90,000. Total of 9.45 million. Coupled with your fine. The cost of anti-social behavior you have to pay is. More than 15 million. So you will sentence me with a fine? If you eat prison food, together with your Father. Who will look after your Grandpa property? Thank you, Prosecutor He. Did you see the criminal face? I really... I said many times, I only saw his nose. Not indicted. Department Head. Yes, Prosecutor.

Mr. Kang Congress Member. It is said that during course of public recommended process.. You and the party Guidance Department has undergone some great friction. Lee Bae-Ho, Representative Minister leading a new era and a new look. Entrust me with all the rights and has inspired me. Party Guidance Department recommended public member?s results was very satisfied. How can he say like this? What? Because of corrupt People Friends Party? I really... What is this? Until now, that means we are all corrupt? Mr. Kang Congress Member that... Has he played over his head, Representative Minister. Mr. Kang Congress Member is really overbearing. Is immeasurable with any other young people. Don't you agree, President Kim? Headache election season is here once again. To those in power can be removed any idea of Congress. He must be drunk in broad daylight. As long as touched upon will be able to find fault. In this season of confusion. As prosecutors, the best strategy for us is not to do anything at all. Non-intervention. Wait for this period to end. Everyone will be on vacation. We must definitely not be shaken. - Yes, the District Director. - Yes. Do you mean, if we see some unlawful acts happing in front of us, we must ignore it? As a Prosecutor who takes the national tax. You must continue to work hard. But try not to encounter any illegal acts. You brats! Do you understand? - Yes. - Yes. Hey, Uncle. How far is Nam-Song? Underbred Kid. Coming soon. All these Country bumpkin only know how to say it coming soon. How much further do I have to drive? This kid. If you can find it, it should be an hour.

Do you have any other evidence, Congress Member? Regarding money transferred to Lee Bae-Ho account. Development funds have been handled as a party. And cash cannot be traced. Congress Member have you given Mr. Lee Bae-Ho... Anything of value? You should give it up. I almost died from being stabbed by a knife. Even if I want to give up now, it is too late. So I want to get to the bottom of it. I do not believe an ardent Prosecutor alone will be able to seize political people. Or am I wrong? If you do not wished to be stabbed again, give up now. Chul-Gyu, does he frequently come? I haven't seen much of him recently. 20-year political career. To the end, all family members die. No matter, whether Father or son. All I am left is debt and a criminal record. I know I am shameless. But Chul-Gyu, please take care of him. Although, it is a bad destiny, but we are friends after all. This kid originally is naughty. And I don't know what trouble he will be in. Candidate Seo Hye-Rim. You must be elected. Thank you for coming here despite your busy schedule. Thank you, Mr. Kang Congress Member. I believe you will pull together. To get our Candidate Seo Hye-Rim into the Congress. You do not have to worry. We will get her elected. Should be coming soon. Who else is coming? Yes, she is very punctual time ... Please take off. What? Please all take off your pants and shoes. Why? Since you are a female Candidate, you must look feminine. You must definitely not make woman's lose face. Now, immediately. Change the pants into a skirt. Replace the leather shoes. The shoes chosen must be the most conspicuous to people's eyes. This is... Let me introduce. This person is here to help Miss Seo Hye-Rim to participate in the elections. I am the Party's Institute of Research, Wang Joong-Ki Election Chief. Wang Election Chief have trained many Congress Members. As well as the number of grass-roots organization leaders. I am older than Miss Seo Hye-Rim. And I am the most experienced consultant. I rely on you then. I know I lack a lot but I will do my best. Forget about putting in your best effort. You must have this mentality. If you are unable to be elected, you will be dead. I have learnt all of Candidate Seo's personal information. And it is worst than I expected. But, since I came to participate in the elections. Then, I must not be defeated. Meeting Room is up here. Although, from the beginning, the People Friend Party situation is adverse. However, after Kim Tae-Bong Former Congress Member's bribery case. Now, the People Friends Party's support... Is drops to a record low of 19 percent. As the opposition party supported is 30 percent. 10 percent support non-political affiliation. 40 percent support for the ruling party. The following... are 500 local voters. According to Gender, Age, Education, Area. The results of our research. When did you get these data? Well-Being Party, Candidate Li Ji-Tai is 25 percent. Non Party, Candidate Kim Hyun-Gab is 20 percent. Our Party, Candidate Seo Hye-Rim is... 12 percent. The remaining 40 percent are fixed vote. Non-political affiliation vote and fixed votes percentage is so large. I think this is because Kim Tae-Bong former Congress Member. Anyway as it goes, Candidate Seo chance of getting elected is Zero. Candidate Seo. You should have lots of experience in love? What? How to seize the heart of a lover trying escape? This is this election, the winning strategy. From just now, everyone has been slipping away. Where did they go? They went opposite. They fly there without any loyalty. All went to Kim Hyun-Gab Office. - What? - Cheers... Cheers... Kim Hyun-Gab... Kim Hyun-Gab... Just now those people, why did they go there? Not just those people, vice chairman. The Party Member's list was taken over. What? Long live... Long live... What are you all doing? Mr. Kang Congress Member. Mr. Kang is also here to support candidate Kim Hyun-Gab. How can you do such a thing? Being People Friend Party Members. How can you support an insignificant Candidate? As Party Members, actually stolen the Party Member's List? And came to support the opponents? Do you think the Party Ethics Committee? Is just an empty shell? I will be holding a meeting to pursue your responsibilities. Compared to a zero probability Candidate elect. Support Candidate Kim Hyun-Gab, to get back the love of their original heart of the party. If you do not support, then forget it. What nonsense are you talking, Mr. Kang Congress Member? What?

In order not to let citizens suffer huge losses due to disaster. The introduction of safety measures Don't you intend to continue saying, Candidate Seo? Wait a moment, Wang Election Chief. So many things, I have to finish doing in a year? What? All these things, how can a one-year term Congress Member be able to finish? This is false promise that one cannot honor. What are you doing, Candidate Seo? We are now in front of citizens who are entitled to vote. But these are lies. You both do not need to quarrel. Just let us build a KTX here? Land prices will also rise and rise. After KTX will pass by here, of course it will be better. But this is a national policy that has been decided. If you want to change the line. The Country will suffer a great loss. I cannot tell a lie just to get your vote. Oh, for Heaven Sake! What are you doing? If voters ask you to do that, that is what you should do. That is right. If it is Kim Hyun-Gab, he will promise us long ago. Everyone, Congress Member will not sweep the front yard for every person. I do not want to be elected, using these unable to realized commitments.

Must coordinate the interests of the motherland. Only abandoned the area for their own self-interest sake. Only then will we... No one is listening. Let's end the lobby and return to the office. Thank you for listening to us. It is here, Prosecutor. Masahiro sword. Prices are ninety-five thousand. It seems to be sand transfer machine blade with special treatment. It is said when gang hire killer in employment. This is how they sharpen the knife. I will go check which organization. Good. You have come, District director. This is the latest report of illegal indoor gambling. This is the police jurisdiction. How can I do grab other people's jobs? I heard it is associated with the Election. Police personally requested a joint investigation. Gambling and Election what is the relationship, District Director? In the rural country, running for local Elections. Where did the money suddenly come from? Seo Hye-Rim even if she grow horns will not be able to grow the money. That means someone is lying. That is a transaction under the jurisdiction of urban management. We only focus on violent organizations. You this kid. Urban management is charge of the gambling place. Anyway, you are all idle now. Ha Do-Ya, you will be responsible for investigating the gambling place. Did you hear me? I know. Money cannot be spent. No commitment to Convention. I said, when why did you run for this election? To be eliminated? In order, to write in your resume the experience of losing an election? Do not blame me, Wang Election Chef. I did it that because my heart is unable to accept your Conventions. People who run for Congress. In addition to being elected, what other ideas do they have? Convention need not be applied in practice. But used for the Election purpose. I said many times already. In the Republic of Korea. Which Congress Member rely on feasible Convention to be elected? Let him stand out and see. Furthermore, if you become a Congress Member with ability. Such a convention, why can't it be implemented? Don't say KTX. Even if it is to travel to the Moon, spacecraft can be made. Why do you say cannot? I just do not want to make agreements that I cannot fulfill. While your simple idea is very good. But, if unsuccessful in being elected. Whether or not you be able to comply. All these will become wasted paper. Beautiful defeat. Sounds nice to hear. Do you know how miserable that is? Dirty victory compared to beautiful defeat is sometimes a thousand times greater. No matter what, we cannot lie to the voters. If you go on being so stubborn. Even if it is Mr. Kang Congress Member who requests me to help. I have to give up the election. Do as you please. Welcome. You have any availability rooms? Customer, are you alone? I came to gambling. Money is in the bag. Please wait a moment. Yes, customer. Come down. Hey, what are you doing? You better be good. You intend to give advance warning? Room number? Room 305 and 402. I bet everything I have. Wait a moment. Read the card carefully. Royal Flush. Wait, see what I have. Junko. No objections, right? Who is it? What are you doing? Everyone stop where you are! We will record everything with the DV. - Freeze! - Do not move! This is the knife-edge. Stop! You, actually hit me where I was previously injured? You are dead for sure. Dad, you are looking for me? I have heard the things happening between Lee Bae-Ho and you. I had a difficult time arranging to meet with Lee Bae-Ho. Unconditionally quit the post of Chairman. And kneel in front of Lee Bae-Ho to beg for mercy. Dad. Even if you wish to draw your sword there is a right time to do so. A rookie and you dare be responsible for Replacement Election. This is my own choice. Even if there is a responsibility it will be borne by me. How are you going to be responsible? Resign from from your Congress Member position? If is only for an elected Congress Member. I do not have to choose you to be my son-in-law. Do you think big power is child play? Dae-Won-Gun know how to bite the bullet. Rare heroic comedy performance in front the rival. Want to jump far. Should must first learn to crawl. I benefited a lot in the past two days. Thank you for your guidance. If you really learnt something, that is a good thing. Come, let's drink a cup. This election... I will repay you back. Kang son-in-law. To break a shaking like a drunken-like corrupted political. I will come back alive. To meet you elder. Kang son-in-law, what are you doing? I am sorry, Dad. I'm sorry, Representative Minister. I apologize to you on his behalf. Previously, my boss. President Kim, do you know him? Yes. He has a hot temper but is a person full of charismatic. He once said. People willing to be trampled. Is no fun at all. Head high as the serpent. Then, is fun to trampling on. This shows that... Please forgive him for his youth and ignorance. Son-in-law is also my child. It is my fault for not teaching the child well. President Kim, you have a good son-in-law. At that age, if he does not have any ideas, then... What is the use? Only when he experience the sinister society. Will he grow up. Mr. Kang Congress Member, I want to leave this place. What happened, Wang Election Chief? Candidate Seo, she... Actually, flatly rejected my Convention. There is nothing else I can do. Wang Election Chief, let's make the long story short. I want to place all my political career. And gamble it on Seo Hye-Rim's election. So Wang Election Chief, please bet your life on it as well. Please... Wang Election Chief. Let's go for a drink. At this time, you still have the mood to drink? Today, is a very hard day. Don't you drink? I am not that kind of person who go drinking whenever it is hard. I also will not drink without a drinking partner. Candidate Seo. Tell me the truth. What is your reason for running the election? Want to let my Dong-He. Be able to eat whitebait that is as large as Mackerel. What? At the end of the river over there. There is a block of land around the estuary to the seas. Although, there is only mosquitoes swarm pit living there. To abandon the land there. People also cannot live there. If it is blindly develop. This river will have to bear the full decay. And not allow people to live and work. Whitebait group will also leave. Therefore... I want to run for the election. What you are saying? If we say it like now. Will we be able to sway the hearts of the voters? What? We neither have the financial resources. And no organization. And we cannot compete in a similar way as Kim Hyun-Gab. How are you to compete with Kim Hyun-Gab? This is how we should do it? Although, it is very difficult. You have to completely change the thrust of the Election conception. That is... To have whitebait as big mackerel group return to that land development. This should be what we should do. Inside this. By itself has hundreds of millions of potential. And you also did a special edition coverage. And together with the residents near the land and fought with Prosecutors. Residents here, have long forgotten about it. That is so like Wang Election Chief. You are really worthy of being the Election expert. Mr. Kang Congress Member has bet his political career. We have to give this a shot. We... Let's start from the bottom up, Wang Election Chief. Cheers! Cheers! Yes... Everyone, our activities has ended. Should we go and play? - That is nice. - That is nice. - Where should we go? - Where should we go? Do you want to go down there and see? Yeah, That, isn't it Bololo Sister? Hello, everybody. I'm Seo Hye-Rim. That Sister, during that time, wasn't she completely destroyed? Yes, and there is nobody. Just flies, flying around. Just flies, flying around. Yeah, since we have nothing to do. Let go cheer for Bololo Sister. - Ok. - Ok. - Ok. Go! Let's Go! All of you. This river. Don't everyone wish to have whitebait as large as mackerel group once again come back? Because of the mosquitoes swarm, residents who unable to live a good life, were forced to leave. So it is necessary to let them return to their homeland. So... We must convince Miyoshi Group. Prevent Establishing a LCD factory and field in environment protection. For this issue. I, Seo Hye-Rim. Will risk my life to fight this cause. Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Seo Hye-Rim... Thank you. Sister. Do you remember me? Aren't you Lee-De? Lee-De. Lee-De. Lee-De. What is the matter? Rainbow orange colour is Lee-De, you?

At that time, Sister quietly took me to the bathroom. Help me change clothes and helped me wash it. That is really great! Quickly, go in. Quickly. This summer we said before. What sort of a cheer is that? Can't you stay there properly. Although, I do not know whether to call you Sister or Auntie. I say, aren't you cold at all? Belly button already showing. I am only thirty. However... This is our concept of this election. Environmental Land Development. And save whitebait. What do you mean? What? This is fall already, where got whitebait? What will Seo Hye-Rim do? What will she do? Sister election that time, we destroyed but not completely destroyed. We have to repay this debt. For our Bololo Sister.

I have investigated a bit. That person is a gambling man with previous criminal record. Because of gambling. Even his family was shattered. Although money is money. But, to be betrayed by my own people, I am really find it hard to believe. That man... When all the staff left, still stayed back. Do you mean that... This is also all planned?
