ðŸŽµ We three Kings of Orient are... ðŸŽµ Sir, collecting for the county orphanage? Sir? Merry Christmas, sir. Ma'am? Collecting for the county orphanage? [Lady] Here you are. Thank you very much, ma'am. Merry Christmas to you. Ma'am, collecting for the county orphanage? I don't have any change. But will this do? That's fine. Thank you, ma'am. Merry Christmas to you. It's been almost two weeks. Yes, yes, I know. I promised to speak to him, and I will. No, I will! But the moment has to be right, or... If he even knew I was talking with you now... I'm going to be late. Mr. Thatcher! It means life or death to us. I know. Collecting for the county orphanage? Merry Christmas. Thank you very much, sir. ðŸŽµWestward leading, still...ðŸŽµ Sir? Collecting for the county orphanage. Here you are. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Merry Christmas to you too, sir. Mr. Slade wouldn't be in by any chance, would he? Well, uh... Mr. Slade is very busy. That time of year. Payments due. Accounts receiveable. But if... if you send him a letter... I'm sure he'd... [Slade] Ridiculous, Thatcher! Of course I want to see the orphanage kids. Let them in. Wonderful children. Just wonderful. I see you've been practicing. Yes, sir. On that new piano, sir. It sure is a beauty. We won't talk about the piano right now, will we? On the other hand, I'm sure that a holiday gift would not be objected to? [children excitedly agree] Yes, right. I had these printed at my own expense. One for you... And one for you... You're going to learn how the great men of this country Self-made men Did it all on their own. Morgan. Coolidge. Zebulon Pike. Climbed that mountain hand-over-hand. Never asked for anything. Thrift. Hard work. Pay your bills on time, maybe you'll have a mountain of your own some day. Remember, don't rest on your laurels. It breeds decay. Don't dawdle. Bye bye. Thanks for coming. [child] Bye. [Slade] Bye bye. Thank you very much, sir. No, it's a pleasure. I like to help young people. Bye bye. [blows raspberry] Hey. Come on. Mr. Slade thinks he's really doing us a favor, you know? I mean, he really believes it. So, let's all show our appreciation for him, huh? I believe we have some visits to make. Yes, sir. You got the papers ready? Yes, sir. They're all here. Here, sir. Truck full of gas? Joe checked everything out. [Slade] Good morning, Mr. Reeves. Chilly. I assume I don't have to tell you why I'm here. No, sir. If we could have one more extension, Mr. Slade. Just a couple of months? I think we can make the payments. [Slade] You "think" you could? [Jennie] Well... [Matt] Don't beg him, Jennie. The man has come to do what the law allows. Nothing we can say will stop him. Thatcher. Sir? [Thatcher] Repossession order. Merrimack County Court. ðŸŽµ[depressing violin music]ðŸŽµ Can I help you, gentlemen? Give this to Mr. Jessup. He'll understand. Yes, sir. ðŸŽµ[faint piano music]ðŸŽµ [children's voices] [Jessup] Memories, Mr. Slade? [chucking] Well... It would be only natural. Place hasn't changed much since you were a boy. May I remind you, sir, that I lived here for a year. I... I bet you remember a lot during that year. [Slade] A little under a year. [Jessup] Ballgames at Webster Park... Chestnuts at holiday meals, and... Caroling on the streets at Christmas... [Slade] Yes I know. They came to my office this morning. Now, can we get down to business? Business? Yes. I'm afraid our situation hasn't changed very much. Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, Jessup. You shouldn't have gotten in over your head. But we needed a piano. After 42 years, the old one fell apart. We had no choice. [Slade] Neither do I. Thatcher! Thatcher. Repossession order, Merrimack County Court. Oh. [short chuckle] Uh, Chaucer mixed in with Plato and Socrates. Can you imagine that? When did you change your stock? Change it? I advanced you $5000 for a university shop. To me, that means... sweaters, bow ties, ukuleles. To me, it means wisdom, Mr. Slade. With all your wisdom, have you found a way to pay your debt? Well, not all of it, but you can take all the money I have. And I will. Plus your stock for liquidation. Scrap paper, penny a pound, eh? Better than nothing. Thatcher! Attachment order, Merrimack County Court. [Slade] Is this genuine leather? It's Morocco. [Slade] Yeah, it feels good. Don't do that! [Slade] There might be a few dollars in this after all. Take everything that's leather, we'll rip it apart at the warehouse. Yeah. Oh, not that one, sir, please! Above all, not that one! Why not? Well, it's an original edition of Mr. Charles Dickens. It was given to me by my father. Who... got it from his grandfather, who was a friend of Mr. Dickens. It must be protected. Oh, Mr. Merrivale, you don't need books! You make up wonderful stories by yourself. Don't forget the rest in here. ðŸŽµ[minor harmonization of We Wish You A Merry Christmas]ðŸŽµ Slowly, boys, slowly. This is a wonderful piece of goods. [Slade] Bring it over here. Joe, make sure the garage is double-locked before you go home. [Joe] Yes, sir. [Thatcher] Merry Christmas, Joe. [Slade] Mr. Thatcher, I need a little assistance with the bindings here. Don't just stand there. Are you having some difficultly with your hearing? It's Christmas, sir. Perhaps... Can we talk a moment, Mr. Slade? What on earth for? Well...it's about the town, sir. It's about the times that we're going through. I know all about the "times" we're going through! So get to the point. Well... uh... when there were... When there was, uh, money to... When the quarry was being worked... Well, that couldn't possibly be the point. The quarry has been closed for a year. Ah, no, that's just the point, sir! Now the men who worked there... now, they've had a wonderful idea. And they've asked me to be the spokesman. So, what? Well... Mr. Slade. Since you own so much of the town... If anybody could open up the quarry again, it'd be you! Well, a man of your means! Why would I want to open a business that's failed? Because there's hope for the future in it, sir. Well, in the things that Mr. Roosevelt is doing. New roads, new dams, new public buildings. There's sure to be a need for granite again! Well, if you think that's true, Thatcher, then why don't you open it yourself? You should at least hear me, sir. These men have nothing left. [Slade tsk-tsks] Rebellion? Oh, no, no. [sighs] If the quarry were opened up again, sir... everyone would benefit! There'd be more business in the town. There'd be more money to spend! I mean... it would be prosperous for you, Mr. Slade! Your debtors could pay you on time. And then you wouldn't have... No, go on and say it. I wouldn't have to what? Put a gun to their heads? Take their Victrolas and their lovely couches? And leave them in empty houses? Oh, you really do hate me, don't you Thatcher? No, sir. Yes, sir. I see it in those eyes every time we go out in the truck. Making me out to be some kind of monster for taking what's rightfully mine! Let me tell you something, Thatcher. A man who as is soft as an old shoe is generally of little worth. Always taking the debtor's side. You hold on to those repossession papers like they were stuck to your fingers! And now you're trying to teach ME business? Sir, I only... You only conspire with a gang of quarry rats to take some money out of me! I don't need to learn business from you! I learned it from the best. Jack Latham. The smartest businessman this state ever knew! Until now. Do you know what he said to me on his death bed? He said, "Ben, never throw good money after bad, and never pay a man one penny more than he's worth." So you go back and you tell your quarry workers that their ranks of the unemployed have just been increased by one. No, sir I didn't mean... I don't want to see your face anymore, Thatcher. Get out. [bells tolling in the distance] I'll just get my things. Yes, you do that. [crystal tings] [Thatcher] Good evening, good evening, good evening. Hi, honey! Oh, I'm glad you're home. You okay? Yup. Christmas tree all decorated? Mm-hmm. Well, well, well, well! Look at this activity, now! But where's my Mr. T? Here's my Sarah! [Jonathan] Who turned out the lights? [Thatcher] Now who would this be underneat my coat? WHO is underneath MY coat? It's Jonathan Thatcher! How have you been today? [Jonathan] Fine. [Thatcher] Good. Why'd you bring these things home from the office? Could you excuse me a moment? I'm going to talk to your mother. Please. We need to talk. (reading) "Darkness is cheap, and he liked it. But before he shut the heavy door, he walked through the rooms to see that all was alright. Sitting room, bedroom, lumber room all as they should be. Then there was a clanking noise, deep down below. As if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the cellar. He remembered that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains." Clap trap. [thunder begins to roar] Damn! Oh... Operator! Operator. This is an emergency. I'm Benedict Slade, 4-2-9 Front Street. I seem to have lost all my power... [wind roars] [wind stops] in my ware... operator? Operator? [ghostly whisper] Ben... [chains dragging] [clock tolls] Alright. Alright, come out this minute! I know someone's here. I've got a gun. Oh, come on, Ben. You wouldn't shoot your old partner, would you? Who are you? You know damn well who I am. I know who you want me to THINK you are. You're on the right track. He's dead. Right again. There's some trick being played here. And I know what it is. Shrewd as ever, eh Ben? Makeup. It took 6 pounds of powder and paint to make that actor look like Frankenstein. That's what they said in the paper. And that's what you used: makeup. To make yourself look like Latham. Mr. Whoever-you-are. Then if I'm not Latham, I wouldn't know things only you and Latham knew. Like what? Like telling the Reverend Williams his antique deacon's bench was only a cheap reproduction, so you could snatch it up as collateral and make a profit. Shall I go on? Jack? [whispers] Jack. [whispers] But you're...? Dead? Don't be afraid to say it. It's only a state of mind. That is, two states. I'm in the larger one. Hell? But you don't look... Hell's not what you think it is. Fire, sulfur, devils with pitchforks. None of that. Thank God. It's worse. It's living in all your past, all the time. Forever. It's a politician who sits in a room with all his speeches blaring at the same time. No earplugs, either. And a king who has to keep staring at the faces of the men he sent to war. But you're a businessman. A very good one! You drive a hard bargain, but you've never done anything evil. Evil's not just what you do. It's what you don't do. Each day, each man has a thousand chances. But they're missed forever once they put you in the ground. But you... You can still make changes, Ben. And I'm going to help you. Don't go out of your way for me there, Jack. You're going to get three more visitations. Ghosts? No. That's storybook talk. I think of them as conductors on the Boston main line. And you better go where they take you. Look for them, Ben. Look for them. Jack? Jack? Don't leave me now, Jack! I've got a million questions to ask you! Jack? Where are you? Must have been the cheese. It must have gone off when I didn't realize it. It's just a slight touch of indigestion, that's all. [giggles] It's too quiet in here, that's the problem. [radio plays music, Slade whistles] [Radio announcer] Ladies and gentlemen As reported earlier The stock market has taken a severe plunge. And investors... [Slade] Again? ...seem convinced that the market is headed for certain disaster! We are standing by for a statement from President Hoover. He will speak to the nation... [Slade] He's not president. on the state of the American economy. [Slate] It's Roosevelt. Our microphone is set up in the Oval Office [Slate] God help us. of the White House, where Mr. Hoover is about to begin his address. Sources close to the White House say that Mr. Hoover will attempt [Slate] Damn announcer doesn't know what he's talking about. to convince the American people... [radio tuning and static] [crowd noises] [Different radio announcer]He's climbing out of the cockpit now! He throws back his goggles and jumps to the ground. Listen to that crowd! And who can blame them on this glorious day of 1927, when Charles A. Lindbergh has become the first man to fly the Atlantic Ocean! [Slade] Twenty-seven? That was 6 years ago. Has everyone lost their mind? ...with the warmest welcome afforded an American citizen. [upbeat jazz music begins to play] [music stops] [music resumes] [music stops] [music resumes] [music becomes a trumpet solo] Nice instrument. I played a trumpet in a war. Long time ago. You should've seen those walls come down. How'd you get in here? You make it sound as if I'd been away. The past is always nearby. Especially here. I suppose you're going to tell me now that you are the Spirit of Christmas Past? You said it, not I. It's not going to work, you know? I know who you are. So why don't you just go back to your little silly book store, Merrivale? Not much of a book store anymore. I said get out! Outside! Alright. [wind howling] Outside. [Slade] What are you doing? What's going on here? [Spirit] Had enough? [Slade] Yes, I've had enough, thank you very much. Get me back inside! Sorry to be so dramatic But you did bring it on yourself. Jack said "visitations" not "freezing to death!" What is it you want? The past wants only to be remembered. I remember the past very well without your help, thank you. Do you remember it? Really? Or just those parts you pick out for yourself? [Slade] Do you know this place? I know this place. The county orphanage. I guess we've come to a costume party. [Spirit] Guess again. [Slade] Well, people haven't dressed like this for 40 years! [Spirit] You're getting warmer. [Girl] They're coming, they're coming! Boys, get ready! Everyone, get ready! [Slade] Ah, here comes Mrs. Tidings. She runs the place. Nope, it's impossible. She's dead. [Spirit] She wasn't when you were here. [Mrs. Tidings] They're the best of the lot, Mr. Brewster. Well-behaved. Intelligent. Deserving. That's excellent, Mrs. Tidings. Excellent! Of course, whoever we choose for our apprentice will have to be able to learn the business from the ground up. Oh, I'm sure every one of these boys would be more than satisfactory. Who's that in the back of the room? Oh, that's Benedict Slade. Where? [Mrs. Tidings] He hasn't been here very long. When his parents died, he was passed around among aunts and uncles. Then they turned him over to us. [Slade] So skinny! Why didn't you feed me better? How is he with his hands? He fights a lot. [Brewster] Has he ever used tools? More from anger than skill. Well, at least that's a beginning. [Mrs. Tidings] Oh, Mr. Brewster, I don't think you'd be advised to take that boy. Excuse me, Mrs. Tidings. I'd much rather do something for someone who NEEDS rather than someone who just WANTS. Please bring him over to us, would you? Thank you. [inaudible] Looks like Mrs. Tidings convinced you. Yes, yes. She always... had a way with boys. Thank you, Roy. Down you get, lad! [Mrs. Brewster] Don't keep him here too long, Nathaniel. Remember dinner is 5 o'clock sharp. We'll be there. Come on, boy. Now, your job will be to look after pieces of machinery, like that. Keep them clean, keep them oiled. 'Course, you'd have to dust off all the furniture back there in the showroom, too. And, let's see. What else? Well, sweep up at the end of the day. You see how much we need that. The most important thing: Every minute you get, you watch the craftsmen. See what it is they do, and how they do it. Before you know it, you might have a bench of your own. Do you think you'd like that? I don't know. [Slade] What do you mean you don't know!? You imbecile! Anybody can see this is a thriving business. I'm trying to offer you an opportunity, young man. Well, you can give it to someone else. That must have been very rough on you, Ben. Very painful for you, losing your parents like that. And being shifted around from relative to relative? Every time you start feeling close to someone, they move you on. Guess after a while, it just seems better not to get too close to anyone. And it doesn't hurt so badly when you have to leave. [Slade] How could he look inside me like that? How'd he know how I felt? If you want to be my apprentice you can move right in with my family and you'll never have to move until you want to. I want to leave now. Well, that's up to you. Do you know what that is? Sure I do. It's a stick. A stick? Is that all you see here? Is it? [chuckles] Well, you're not as bright as I thought you were. This is anything that I want it to be. That could be a magician's wand for doing tricks. Or it... could be the handle of a whip for taming wild lions. Or it could make this into the spoke of a ship's wheel that could lead you to all kinds of new lands and new adventures. I could even carve that into a flute and then I could play it to charm all those folks in old Hamelin town. Here. That could be anything you want it to be. Unless, of course, you're too dumb to see anything but a stick there. [loud machinery] Thank you. [Adult Slade] I've almost forgotten how beautiful she was. There's quite a lot you've forgotten. So I said to father, what is so high and mighty important about finishing school in Boston? Do you know what he said to me, Ben? Two coats of finish! What? Two coats of finish instead of three. [Helen sighs] We can reduce production by a day! You haven't heard one thing I've said! Sure I have, I've been listening. Have you? [Slade] Yeah. Then you know how I was talking about the park? Nature? Do you like nature, Ben? [Slade] Yeah. Would you like to get really close to it? I mean, really close. Would you? Yeah. [Helen] Good! Oh, ow! [chuckling] Oh, you're gonna pay for that! What did you father say? Oh, I thought you weren't listening. You see? Don't underestimate me, Helen. Well, I told him. No finishing school for me. No anything would take me away from... ...from Concord. Yeah? Yeah. ðŸŽµ[band playing upbeat music]ðŸŽµ [song ends] Ladies and gentleman! [drum rimshot] Thank you. [chucking] Well, I'm sure after all that that you really want to get your breath back, so we're going to give out some gifts. [applause, cheering] [Mrs. Brewster] Sam? Sam Perkins? [Brewster] Sam! Sam Perkins! There's a message, Sam. [Sam] "What every foreman needs at home" Uh...Essie? Where is Essie? Ah, thank you. Thank you, Miss Brewster. Thank you very much. [Brewster] What in the world have we here? To the Brewster family and all their employees, "the future"? Let's find out. I guess cut in and hope for the best. Hope I'm not damaging whatever it is. [laughter] Stapleton Furniture Company Grand Rapids, Michigan. I guess the jokes on me. That's not a joke, Mr. Brewster! What, did you bring this, Ben? Yes sir, I did. I believe, I believe that chair is the future. And I think it can help us all if we're smart enough to use it. How? That chair is not made the same way that we make ours. It's made on the assembly line. That's right! They're starting to use the assembly line now in furniture. Some fellow puts on one part, another fellow puts on another... They're all made by machinery. They can sell that chair for one half the price of one that we put out. [Brewster] Yeah, but look how it's made! Nails, instead of pegs. Bad fittings all sloshed with glue to keep them together. You call that a chair like ours? [laughter] There are millions of people who won't know the difference. [Sam] Yes they will! Excuse me! They'll just look at the price tag and that's the one that they'll buy. Oh, I can't accept that, Ben. No, when the day of quality ends in this country we'll all be in great trouble, indeed. [applause, shouts of agreement] What did you get in your, your gift there? [laughter] [Sam] My boy will love 'em! [Brewster] Your boy? So will your wife. Oh, and as ever. Here, Sam, a bonus check for you. Ben! Ben, that wasn't very polite! Go inside, Helen. It's raining. So they disagreed with you. Is that such a terrible thing? You think I'm angry because he disagreed with me? That's not it, Helen. That's not it at all. I'm sorry for your father. I feel sorry for everyone that works for him. They're going to be passed by, and that's what I don't want to happen. Ben, then come to dinner tonight and explain it to him again. Do it for me, Ben, please. [chuckling] Did you get a look at Sam Perkins's face when he lifted out those boxing gloves? [Mrs. Brewster laughing] Oh, that poor man! [Brewster laughing] He almost swallowed his cigar! Mr. Brewster. Yes, son? I know that bringing in that chair this afternoon was a smart aleck act. And I deeply apologize. [Brewster] Oh, Ben, that's alright. I know you meant well. I still do, sir. Whether you like it or not mass production is coming, and in order to survive, you've got to start thinking about it. Well, I never will, Ben. Never could. I guess, I'm too old and too stubborn to change. I have something to say to you. All of you. The day you came into the orphanage, you saved my life. And I will never, ever forget that. Even when I leave here. Are you going somewhere? [Brewster] Well, say it, Ben. Whatever it is, just get it out. Ed Stapleton, the man that sent the chair offered me a job with his company in the sales division. It's not a very big job. I know that I can work myself up. I think we need some more sweet potatoes. Helen. I don't think you understand! I hate you right now, talking to me about babies and rings, and all the time knowing you were going. I didn't know until tonight. Well, you must have been thinking about it. Why didn't you say something? Because I was hoping I was going to change my mind. I didn't want to hurt you. I love you very much. Then take me with you. I can't. Why not? Because I'm starting low out there. I'm at the bottom rung of the ladder. I don't even have enough to get myself by! Do you think that matters to me? I don't mind sacrificing. I know. I mind that you sacrifice! I'll call you as soon as I'm ready. I promise. When? [Slade] When? [Helen] When. When we can live the way I want to live. With nice clothes and a nice car and a nice house! When we walk down the street, Helen they're going to say, "there go The Slades." It's going to mean something. We're going to be somebody! I want to be somebody. Success. I guess that means just about everything to you. Are you rested now? I will be after a good night's sleep. But to tell you the truth, I'm not sure I'm not sleeping now. Now what does that make me? The word that comes to mind? Nightmare. You'll forgive me if I don't say "thank you very much" when you leave. Leave? You really are something. Did you think our trip was over? That I'd let you off so easily? A lifetime, Mr. Slade. A million moments of giving, taking. Fighting. Losing. Each moment a decision. Each decision affecting others. Each to be accounted for. Each? We keep very careful inventory. As you do. [upbeat, brassy band music] [music stops] [applause] I have the figures for our sale of war bonds up until 9 o'clock this evening. It's... 24,150 dollars! [Helen] The booths will be open until midnight so let's try and reach our goal of 25,000 dollars! [Slade] Miss Brewster! Miss Brewster. I have in my hand 850 dollars. You've reached 25,000 dollars. Well, here it is! [cheering and applause] You're looking well, Ben. We I can certainly turn the compliment. [band begins playing] Oh, your money clip. Thank you. Come over here, and I'll write you up. You know, it's amazing. I thought about everything that I was going to say to you when I first saw you. And all I can come up with is Dandy. My dog? You wrote that he was in a terrible accident. Did he recover? Oh. Yes, perfectly. But that was 4 years ago, Ben. I really am sorry. No need to be. I'm not even sure who stopped writing first. Ben! Very nice to see you. Mr. Brewster! Well, you're certainly looking... [Brewster] Yeah, older! I know. But no wiser. I've had two heart attacks and I still haven't the sense to quit. They were mild anginas. Alright. You know, there's a way of taking it easy and still staying in business. Oh, we're easing up alright, Ben. The men are going off to war, and... their families are spending their money on... bonds. It's not that much left over for furniture. It doesn't matter nowadays. There's a brand new way of selling. It even works on people who don't have the price! What's it called, "St. Patrick's miracle"? Time payments. Time payments? That's very interesting. It's nice to see you again. You happy, Ben? Oh, success is a wonderful feeling. People can smell it. They sense it. Especially when you're on the move. On the rise. That's why I'm leaving the Stapleton firm. I thought you were doing so well there. I was. Until I ran smack into the Stapleton nephews. They have a saying there. You don't move any further unless you're related. [Helen chuckles] So, I'll find another mountain to climb. Here, in Concord? It's very possible. I'd love to see you home. Alright. [Jack] Mr. Slade? Jack Latham, investments and real estate. [Slade] How do you do, sir? I was interested in what you were saying before about that new way of selling? Could we talk sometime? I look forward to the opportunity. I was told that you'd be here at this party. Come see me just after Christmas. I'll check my calendar. Thank you. [Slade] Yep, that's me! I always moved in when the moment was good. I could always smell a good business deal! So could Latham. Look where he ended up. There it is. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming about... [Helen] Ben. There's something I want to say to you. You keep saying how nothing's changed and everything's the same. Well... Well, we're not the same. We have changed. And, if...if! You stay... We're going to have to get to know each other all over again. I totally agree with you. And as a matter of fact, I think we could start right now. [Helen chuckles] [distant machinery noise] What's that? [Slade] A lathe? It is! But nobody's supposed to be in there. Alright. Alright, you stay right here. I'll be right back. [Helen] I'm going with you. Helen, please. [Helen] I'm going with you, Ben! [Slade] See, everything is still the same. Hold your ground! Ben Slade? Good evening, Sam. [Sam] Must be 10 years at least. Ah, you scared me to death. [Chucking] You're not the only one. What are you doing here so late on a Christmas Eve? Just catching up on a bit of work. Does my father know you're here? No, he'd never allow it. But, has to be done now that half the people are gone. I appreciate what you're doing, Sam, but I want you to stop right now and go home to your family. Yes, and I agree. Just 15 minutes more. I promise you. You're too good to us, Sam. Do you need a hand? For a couple of table legs? Get outta here! Very good to see you. Good night, Sam. [Sam] Bye Ben, bye hon. [Slade] Merry Christmas, Sam! [fire alarm bells] [firefighter] Charlie! Call the Boscawen and Suncook brigades! We need help! Right away. [Brewster] Let me go, let me through! It's my factory! [Brewster] Oh, God. Oh my God! Sorry, Mr. Brewster. Lucky your man came out alive. What? There was someone in there? [Firefighter] Sam Perkins. He'll be alright. Minor burns. We took him to the hospital. [Brewster] Was he...? What? The poor man. He doesn't deserve it. [Spirit] You're looking a little pale, Mr. Slade. Something wrong? Take me back to my warehouse. I don't want to see anymore. You're going to have to, just the same. I'll get those figures written up for you as soon as possible then, "J". Well, there's no hurry. [Brewster] Well there is for me. Ben! I'm very sorry to hear what happened. Oh. Well, I'm such a smart businessman, Ben that I went and let the insurance policy lapse. [chuckles] Can you believe that? Well, we'll... we'll get the old place rebuilt again some day with luck and help of good friends. Take care of yourself, okay? [Brewster] Always, always. Come on in. Nice to see you. May I help you? Thanks. Are you alright? Y...yes. Yes, I'm fine. "Time payments" you called it? That, or "the installment plan". Customer makes a down payment of maybe 10%. Goes home with the product. Pays it off a little each month plus interest for about a year or two. By the time he's finished, you've got 150% of the purchase price. What happens if he can't make the payments? If he's working, you attach his salary. If not, reposses it. Take it back. Sell it again. It's not unheard of that you can get 200% of the list price. I like it. But I don't mean I'm going to invest. Scheme like that takes a lot of capital. And everyone knows that you are the most powerful money-man in these parts, sir. [chuckles] And that's just the trouble. My money's spread all over the place. Everyone making demands. Take old man Brewster: banks turned him down so he came to me. Wants a hundred thousand to rebuild his shop. Maybe more later. Can't do that and finance your scheme too. If I might make a point, sir. Mr. Brewster is a wonderful man and I owe him a lot. But he's been doing the same thing for 40 years. He won't even look at a new idea. And I sincerely believe... That he wasn't doing that well before his loss. Told me he was climbing back. Not to overstep my bounds, but if it were my money to invest... and I had the choice between a rigid "old" and the innovative "new"... It would be no contest. ...I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. (continues with Psalm 23...) This isn't fair, Helen. I didn't make that decision, Latham did! I wouldn't hurt your father for all the money in the world! If I'm lieing... IF I am lieing... then let my eternal soul be damned. [thunder crashes] I didn't kill your father! I didn't, Helen! ðŸŽµ[children singing Silent Night]ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ[singing grows louder]ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ[children singing God Rest Ye Merry Gentlement]ðŸŽµ Come in, Mr. Slade! Come in! You better put that down! You break it, you'll hear from me! Get off there! Get off there! You're wasting your time, Jessup. This isn't going to work. Christmas has worked for 2000 years! It's working now. I suppose you're going to tell me that you're some great Spirit of the Christmas Present? You do have an interesting way of putting things. Yes, well then you put it right out of your mind. Because you... I don't know how you got in here! But you're not going to... you're not going to leave with my piano! Repossesed by court order! It belongs...to me! Ben, you're entitled to the music you like best. Do you have any favorite selections? Yes, I do! My privacy, which I shall enforce by calling the police! I'm going to close my eyes for 15 seconds. And when I open them, you... you best be... ðŸŽµ[singing fades away]ðŸŽµ Gone. Imagination. [plays God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen] [ghostly whispers sing] [children singing God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen] [Spirit] You can't block out the Christmas spirit! It's everywhere. What do you want from me!? Only the share this beautiful holiday with you. As someone else might have done. Someone else? That child looks so familiar. No, it's impossible. She should familiar Mr. Slade. Like mother, like daughter, guessing. That's Helen's child! We're in Helen's house? [Spirit] You never kept track of her, did you? She married a pharmacist. Very happy too, as you can see for yourself. [Slade] Oh, she's lovlier than ever. [Spirit] A woman fulfilled is always beautiful. Come, Mr. Slade. It's a private moment for them. I could have had a child like that. If only things were different. [Spirit] If? That word can be found on dry river beds and on trails long overgrown by weeds. What's more important are the paths we follow now. [Slade] I know this place! I've never been here before. Why does it look so familiar? [Spirit] A picture, maybe? On my office wall. My... employee over his desk. Your former employee, remember? He deserved to be fired. Disagrees with everything I do! Conspires with others to pull money out of me. Who need someone like that around? There are three in here who do. Mom? Dad? Please tell us what's wrong. Nothing's wrong, dear. I know you don't want us to feel bad. But it's worse just trying to guess. We make up all kinds of things. My goodness! Can't your father and I have a secret without the world coming to an end? [sighs] I... lost my job today. Is that all? We thought it was something worse! [Sarah] That you killed somebody with an axe and were going to be hung! [Doris] There's someone I'd like to kill with an axe! Now, you don't mean that, Doris. You'll... you'll get another job, won't you, Daddy? Yes, I will. Of course. Eventually. As a matter of fact, I happen to be considering one at the very moment. [Jonathan] What is it? I have been offered the job of... exalted Grand Master of the Barnum and Bailey Circus! My only problem is, do I take it? [Jonathan] Yes! Yes? My very sentiments exactly! Ladies and gentlemen! The Barnum and Bailey Circus presents! The Flying Thatchers! Boom, boom! Bring on the tigers! Roar! The maestro! Bring on the zebras! Yay! Ha ha! [radio turned off] [Sarah sobbing] If you don't get another job, will we starve to death? Hey Sarah, I bet I can beat you in Chinese checkers. Bet you you can't. The boy, was he in an accident? If it were only that... I suppose the trip for Jonathan is out of the question now? Australia on $128? Supposing we sold the house and the furniture and everything? There's no market for houses. And the furniture... Gets us as far as Columbus, Ohio. Does it have to be Australia? Maybe there's some other place that... You heard the doctor. Only one clinic offers any real hope: Sister Kenny's! Her new way of stimulating the muscles... gets them going again. So that children like Jon... Can lead other normal lives. Well, then, Australia it'll be! You'll find... [Jonathan coughing] Jonathan? Are you alright? I'm okay. He gets out of breath so easily. You'll find some work. Maybe in Boston? And so will I. If we work night and day, he'll have that trip! [coughing continues] [door closes] [Slade] There's something I must know. [Spirit] What's that? Their little boy... Does he live or die? Is that important to you? Yes, it's important! The future's a tricky place, full of shadows. Shifting and changing. As present realities do. Do you see these shadows? As well as most and better than some. And what do they say to you? Next Christmas... I see a pair of crutches in the corner. Carefully preserved. At this table... family... mother... father... little girl Between them is an empty chair. I had no idea, Thatcher. I just didn't know. ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ [static, mixed with rock music] ...authorities predict that widespread use of the new Salk vaccine will soon wipeout the dread disease of Polio... ...once known as "infantile paralysis". Congratulatory messages have flooded in from around the... ðŸŽµ[rock music]ðŸŽµ [static] [otherwordly electronic music] Dumb old box. You'd never replace the Victrola, that's for sure. And who will replace you... Mr. Slade? [Slade] Hold your ground. Hold your ground! You can have the radio back! It's okay. Take it back to the farm, free of charge! Do I look like a farmer to you? [Slade, surprised] No! No. No, you are modern! Modern? More than modern! More than modern. Uh... future. You're the... the Spirit of Christmas Future? You know, I, uh... I don't think you really believe it. I do! I do! Indeed, I do! Well, you'd better, Mr. Slade. Yes, I do! The future is coming whether you like it or not. The distant future. And, a future much closer to you. Where are you going? Items 27 A and B. Bronze bookends! Just feel the weight of those! They're beauties! What-am-I-bid? Who's going to give me $2 to start? Fifteen cents! Fifteen cents, I got fifteen cents here. Twenty five! Twenty five, twenty five, twenty five is the bid. Thirty! Thirty, thirty, thirty cents! Thirty cents! Forty! Any advance on forty-forty-forty cents? is my bid here on these bronze bookends. Fifty! Fifty cents, fifty cents. Fifty-five. [auctioneering continues] I beg your pardon. Who are all these people? And what are you doing on my property? It's all quite legal, I assure you. A dollar once... a dollar twice...? Beyond a dollar? Sold for a dollar! [laughter] He's selling them very cheap. Those bookends are worth three ninety-five. [auction continues] Well, he's got to get rid of everything. Sheriff's orders. Ah, here's a nice bed. Pure mahogany. With a box spring and a mattress. Two suits of clothes, size 40. Five shirts... Six ties, three pairs of shoes. A tie clasp, cufflinks, and a money clip. And what a money clip! What-am-I-bid for the lot? [silence] Are they crazy? This is quality merchandise! Very much like my own possessions. I bid $500 and not a penny less! He can't hear you. One thousand dollars worth every bit! No bids? I bid 10 cents for the lot. [laughter] Bit high, isn't it? [laughter] I find this very distasteful. It gets no better, Mr. Slade. [cheering and celebratory shouting] Who do you think this person is? You can't guess? [Auctioneer] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please! I've saved one final item for this moment! What am I bid for this? Huh? [laughs] Fifty dollars! Fifty dollars, I have fifty dollars once. [auctioneering] Seventy five dollars! Eighty five! One hundred dollars is bid! Now these prices are beginning to make sense. Any more? Sold for a hundred dollars! [cheering and applause] That's me! [crowd] Burn! Burn it! Burn! [Slade] What are you doing!? What are you, crazy? Stop! That's me! Shut up! What do you think you people are doing!? That's me! My portrait! How could you do that!? Let me out of here! Get me out of here! Anywhere! Where to? Where it's peace and quiet! Let me out of here! [Spirit] As you wish. [Thatcher] There are times when I'm heading home that I still expect to find him. Waiting behind the doorway. And then I remember that he's here. My little Mr. T. [Doris] Hard to believe that a year's gone by since he left us. [Slade] That boy. [Spirit] That shouldn't surprise you. Life is cause and effect. And you were certainly no stranger to the cause. That hasn't happened yet. That is not real. The grief of those people is real. You can't blame me for something I didn't know! Thatcher, tell her! Tell her I didn't know you had a sick child! You never said a word! We know there's going to be other partings among us. A marriage. Long voyages. Even death again. But when someone is remembered with love... ...their spirit never really dies. So instead of looking for someone to blame, let's make a promise to each other. That no matter where we find ourselves... ...in years to come... ...together or apart... We will always remember little Jonathan. Now you promise? I promise. Promise? I assure you, if I had known! Things could have been different. Perhaps the possibility exists that it could be different? Is that possible? -That's not for me to say. We'd better go now. Wait. Wait... wait. There is something about this place. Something that... draws me right to it. The monument looks fairly new and yet, neglected. [Spirit] No one visits that grave. [Slade] Not ever? -Not ever. To lie in a... ...a grave... ...unloved and unremembered? It's as if the life was never lived. That is the only real death. [Slade] Who is the unfortunate person? Take a look. Tell me that this can change. I don't want to lie here in... ...a grave. Unremembered and unloved forever. Please tell me it could change. [sobbing] I'm willing to make a change. It's time to go, Mr. Slade. You've seen the future. I'm willing to make a change! I want it to happen differently! [bells ringing] You there, boys! What day is it? [boys laugh] What the devil is so funny about that? Just answer the question! Don't you know it's Christmas? It's Christmas. ðŸŽµ[upbeat, We Wish You a Merry Christmas]ðŸŽµ It's Christmas! There's still time. There's still time. [car horn honks outside] [car horn honks again] It's Mr. Slade. [Thatcher] Slade? [knocking on door] Well, a Merry Christmas to you sir. What are you doing here? I'm working, of course. What are you doing? You're taking the whole day off regardless of all the work that has to be done? But I'm not your employee anymore, sir. [Slade] Don't you tell me who you are. I know more about you than you could possible dream now go out to the truck and get what I've got for you. Go on. Go on! You and I have a very important business discussion. [Doris] What business? What's on the menu for today's dinner? Chicken... carrots... vegetables... [Slade] How big's your chicken? [Doris] Five pounds, wha... [Slade] Five pounds, you call that a holiday chicken? [grunt] Now you try this. Put this in the oven. If it fits. If it doesn't cook it twice. Thank you. These are called Christmas gifts. And to find out... [Sarah] For us? Is it alright if I finish first? Thank you. And to find out who they're for, you just look for the name... ...on top of the box. For daddy! -Yes. For mommy. For mommy and daddy. For me! Thank you! Nothing here for Jonathan. How could that be? Sorry. Oh! What's this? Could this possibly be a...? It's not very large. Not very heavy. You like to ride on a bus? You do? Huh. Here's a ticket on a bus to Boston. You like to ride on a train? Here's a ticket from Boston to Chicago. From Chicago to San Francisco, California. Oh... You like to travel on a ship? Big boat? You do! Huh. Here's a ticket for the SS Monterey from San Francisco, California to Syndey, Australia! And in Australia, there's a clinic run by a Sister: Elizabeth Kenny and I have a darn good feeling that she's going to make you feel very good. 'Course there'll be a nurse to go along with him! You just have to get used to an empty place at the table, that's all. When he gets back... ...the boy will be sitting here in this chair that... ...doesn't need crutches anymore. Mr. Slade... I... I don't know what to... Whoops, here...uh ... that's enough of that. That's enough, thank you. You've got a lot of cooking to do. At least 4 hours for that bird. 4 hours! Which gives you plenty of time before dinner. Merry Christmas. Let's go. Get your coat. I assume you expect to be paid for these few extra hours of work, huh, Thatcher? Oh, no no no, Mr. Slade, you... You SHOULD expect to be paid! You must start thinking like an executive, Thatcher! Vice President in Charge of New Projects is nothing to sneeze at. New projects? Yes, I was thinking of opening the granite quarry down at Penacook Hills. Bring a few hundred jobs into this town. And that's just the beginning. What's going on? No, Mr. Reeves. It's what coming off! A potbellied stove... a rocking chair... and a table-top radio. Repossessed. By you! Grab something. Mr. Reeves? Mr. Reeves. Be very careful of that radio. It's acting very peculiar. Mrs. Reeves? Mrs. Reeves. A very merry Christmas. Indeed. Thatcher! Miles to go! Tie up the truck! [laughs crazily] Now, now. Don't be alarmed. There's a few bindings of [unintelligeble] ripped on top, but that's what they're in business for in the first place. In business? Yes, the Kendall Book Binding company of Cambridge. I spoke to Mr. Kendall himself. He's sending a man here on monday. All books to be restored good as new. Guaranteed! [chuckling] Especially that book that uh... your father gave you. Your grandfather. Nevermind, I told them to take especially good care of that one. And I have something for you. A very merry Christmas, Mr. Merrivale. Did you read that book, Mr. Slade? Did I read that book? The, uh... ghosts of Hell? The Spirit of Christmas Past, Present, and Future? Absolute, unadulterated... what was the word he used? Humbug? Mr. Thatcher, please. [door bell rings] [cheering and commotion] [all sing "We Wish You a Merry Christmas"] [Thatcher] What do we sing now? Let's sing... Deck the Halls! [Jessup] It's a wonderful thing you've done! Just in time for our Christmas party! Looks like it turned out that way. Thatcher, the other item on the truck please. - Yes, sir. And what do you intend to do on your holiday? Oh, I'm not doing anything that special. You're more than welcome to join us here! That's a very nice invitation, thank you. That boy over there. Who is he? That's Harry. Harry Barnes. Bit of a problem. In what way? Well, he's been in a number of foster homes. He always manages to have himself kicked out for some outrageous behavior. Like to get into fights? Use his hands a lot? -That's right Likes to work with tools? Yes, but always in a hostile way. How did you know that? I understand that boy. Here we are, sir. Good good good. Put them under the tree. Jessup, do me a favor will you? Tell that young lad I'd like to take him for a drive. The way he's been acting lately, he doesn't... -Just do this for me, please. Go on and tell him. [no audible dialog] No! No! No! He won't go. Of course. Well, maybe I can persuade him. Now, you listen to me my fine friend. You've been invited to go for a ride. And I'm bigger than you are. So, here are your choices. You can either leave with me smiling, or I'll pull you out of here kicking and screaming, which will not make a good impression on your friends. You have 10 seconds to make a decision. [Slade] I can rebuild this place. Get it humming again! It'll take craftsman... I know a few, but they're getting on in years. I need fresh blood. And that's where you come in, Harry. I need an apprentice. Someone to oil the machines. Make sure they're in working order. Sweep up. What do you think about that? And I'm offering you... A present. And a future. With a promise, Harry. Oh, I promise they will be different. Can we go now? If you can tell me... ...what this is! It's a stick. It's a stick. Well, my friend, you're not as smart as I thought you were. If all you see there is a stick. I can make this into anything I want it to be. To me, it is a... baseball bat... a whip handle, to tame young lions, huh? A spoke of a ship's wheel. Taking me to new... new lands. New treasures. Harry, you can make this into anything you want. Well, maybe you can't because all you see is a stick. Do you have a knife? No. Now you do. Hey! What are you going to make? You'll see. Is that a towel bar? Chair leg. What are you making? Towel bar. Mr. Jessup invited me to the home for dinner. How's the food? Pretty bad. [chuckling] Always was. You know, when you become my apprentice... you're going to live with me. Very much like a foster son. Is that really a towel bar? -Oh, it will be. Doesn't look like a towel bar. -Well... Give me a chance, boy! Give me a chance.
