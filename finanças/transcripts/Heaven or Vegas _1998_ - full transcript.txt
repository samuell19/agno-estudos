And King Arthur and His Court. Well, a lot of stuff like that and I can just read it to you and it would pass the time. I mean look at me. I'm pretty low maintenance. My name's Mary Jo, what's yours? - Navy. - Navy? - Yep. Why don't you grab your things. I'll take you to your place, okay? (upbeat music) - It's uh, it's my day-job. I dreamt of you.

Until I wake up the next morning and all his stuff is in this huge pile and there's like all these precious jewels and stuff. And he gets down on one knee and he says, I've burned all my worldly possessions for the greater love of thee. - Wow, Mary Jo. (Monet chuckles) - So I say, where will we go? And then he said, I will take you to my palace. I mean, I was speechless. - Now that's hard to believe. - I was, believe it. I mean, never before in my entire life have I been championed so greatly. - Yeah, so what's this champion's name, huh? - Navy. - Navy. It's a great story, Mary Jo. You have one hell of an imagination. - He's gonna be here any minute now to get me. - Yeah, of course he will. - [Mary Jo] Any second now. - Mary Jo, why do you do this to yourself? - Any moment now.

Ac-acho, ac-acho, ac-acho it repeated in intervals. Opening its jaws wide every time. So how many has that been? - I think about 13. Not including Cinderella which you read twice. (Mary Jo sighs) - Wow, we're going to Missouri. (Mary Jo chuckles) - It's Montana. - Oh, okay, wow, we're going to Montana, ah! (Mary Jo sighs) You know, when we get there we're gonna have to get a house, like a brick one, you know, like the smart little piggy did. And of course, you'll have to build it and I'll decorate it. Oh, and we'll get lots of friendly farm animals like cows and chickens and sheep and camels and pandas. And there's the whole issue of kids. Um, well at least two but no more than 10, okay? And that way we can live happily, happily ever after. Do you think I'm pretty? - Yeah. - Do you think I'm cute pretty or pretty pretty? - Look, are you gonna talk the entire trip, huh? I mean, the reading you warned me about, but the questions-- - Fine. Anyway, where were we? - How old are you, 12? - 36. - 36, you're not 36. What's this? Mary Jo Tetelen from Houston, Texas. Where did you get this? - What do you mean? It's legit, look. Look at my picture, see? Born March 6th and I'm a Pisces. - That doesn't look anything like you. - That is because I don't photograph well, okay? Look, I'm obviously much cuter in real life than I am in pictures or else I would've been a model. - No water. No water. We are going to follow the rules of the road here. - Rules of the road? - Yes, the rules of the road. Which means we only stop to get gas. And we never, never stop to eat. I knew it. - And what exactly are you doing over there, huh? - I might as well since we had to stop because your bladder was going to burst. - Wait a second, I really thought it was going to, okay? - Put your seatbelt on. - You know, you'd make a great husband. You would. I mean, I'm being completely serious. The whole rules of the road, I mean, that is so male. It's a real turn on. - Well then follow them, shit. - You know, I can just see you with your kids on Christmas Day. - I don't have any kids. - Oh I know, I'm just when we do. Well, when you do, with your wife or whoever. And I can just picture you there with your son in the driveway showing him how to use his new remote control car. And you have this baseball hat on and these flannel pajamas with big fuzzy slippers. (Mary Jo chuckles) - Fuzzy slippers? - Yeah, yeah, it's must what I see. You know, I can't help it. Oh and you know what? There is something else. Oh wait, yep, I'm seeing your wife. And she's got like long brown hair. Kinda like me. And big blue eyes, kinda like me. And a smile kinda like mine.

Except they were never serious, you know? Where did you get a cool name like Navy? - My mom. Like sailors, booze, and one night stands. Voila, here I am. - So what happened to her? - She left me at a department store on my birthday. And I never saw her again. (Mary Jo laughing hysterically) So what about your family? - I don't have any. - I figured. So listen, about Montana. - What? - Well.

Honey, this is Rachel's friend, Navy. And hopefully they're gonna be staying with us a night or two, okay? - Please, we've got plenty of room. - I'll be back.

We are thankful for our family and for our home. And heavenly father at this time we ask a special blessing that will be strengthening and nourishing to our bodies and that it might do us the good that we need.

Must be rewarding, huh? - No, not as much as you think. - Rachel, what exactly were you doing in Las Vegas? - [Stan] Honey, would you pass the string beans, please? - Actually, I was on my knees a lot. You know, scrubbing floors, kind of like Cinderella. And then Navy found my glass slipper and now I'm a princess. Where is the applesauce? - Applesauce. Give her the applesauce. Who's up for ham? - I'll have some. - [Stan] Okay, big slice, little slice. - Big slice is great. - [Stan] Big piece, little piece? - [Navy] Big piece. - All right. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you have blankets and stuff? - Oh yeah, I got enough.

Besides I knew you weren't going to leave me here anyway. - Look, I never said anything about taking you to Montana. I was waiting to do the right thing. And leaving you here is the right thing to do. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (man whistling) - Let's go. - Look, look, those guys.

He married the Bishop's daughter, Peggy. - Now that's really funny because, see we used to get stoned every Saturday night behind the house and he swore up and down that he wouldn't go on one. - Well Rachel, maybe he's cleaned up his act. - Hmm, too bad none of your kids could've turned out that good. - I've got to go. - Well, they seem to be happy. - Yeah, right. Look at her. She's a molly-queen. She makes Marie Osmond look like Madonna. All she used to say was, nice to see ya. And, oh my heck. You know what, a friendly word of advice.

Doesn't he come over for dinner and chess? - Rachel, don't start, okay? - Stan, she likes to argue. - Rachel, Billy's been sick. And it's all I have to do is pray now. So he can find his way back, all right? - So that's why you never came looking for me, huh? Too busy praying. Well your praying doesn't work. - You're here aren't ya? - I'm gonna go see Billy. (gentle guitar music) - [Billy] Oh my God. Oh, my God. (Rachel laughing) Oh dude. I cannot believe. - Hey. - Hi. - Would you like a cookie, it's fresh baked. - Yeah, sure.

You just gotta close your eyes and move your head real slow. It's real easy actually. It's kind of crazy. Just be careful, these people are very physical around here. You have to put yourself in here like that. Yeah, there you go. There we go, yeah, oh.

Stolen? - Navy! ("Space Age Love Song" by A Flock of Seagulls) - Lilli, I'm not who you think I am. I have a lot of skeletons. - Navy, me too, I mean, when I was 13, one time I, I smoked cigarettes for two weeks and one time my parents went out of town and I got really drunk. And I almost had sex with this black football player at Dixie College. - I've done a lot worse. If you only knew. - Navy, please don't make fun of me, okay? If any of my friends knew that I did half of the stuff, they would never talk to me again. - I need to tell ya what I was doing in Vegas. - I don't wanna know. And I don't care. All I care about is how I feel about you, Navy. - Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. - It's hard for me. - It's okay, it's okay.

You did not tell anybody. You just left! That's so rude. - [Navy] I just couldn't do it anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You stupid little fuck! You are sorry. I called every damn police officer in the world to find out where you are. I saw the law! I didn't buy you that fucking car so you could go joyriding in Utah. Come here. Come on. Pack your stuff and we're going to go back tonight, okay? Come on. - I'm not going back. - What? - I said I am not going back. - I don't have time for your stupid little immature temper tantrum. Do you understand? Who are you without me, hm? You are the same punk teenager who stood on the street corners soliciting dirty old men. I took you off the streets. I treated you like you were my own son and this is the thanks that I get. Now let's get going and that is final. - You are not listening to me, all right? I don't care if you take every penny I have, you can keep the car and take the car, I don't care. I am not going back with you. - Let go of my arm, you're hurting me. (Navy sniffling) You can keep the fucking car. It's replaceable just like you. - [Joanne] Lilli, why don't you go upstairs and go to bed. We have church in the morning.

You made a promise, remember? You haven't smiled all day. You hurt my feelings. (gentle guitar music) - Hey, I'm going to take off. I'll just hitch another ride. - What's wrong?

What's it say? - It says, there is more to life, Navy. That's all he wrote. - He has kids. - He looks happy. Man, that's touching. (background chatter)
