About what has made the duke of Anjou use force against her, he says nothing. My dear Diana! If you've fulfilled my wish and followed the count of Monsoreau, you must know... ...that the violent duke of Anjou is a threat to your security. Monsoreau cannot protect you effectively, ...than as his wife; also accept his request. Be assured of my paternal blessing, your father. The following night, the duke and one of his confidants ride around the house of Diana, of which they've gotten the key. Monsoreau has won the match. He has married Diana in secret. But one day, the duke of Anjou... ...recognises her in front of the church, that beloved that he believed drowned. When Bussy is injured in an ambush, Gertrude returns with a young doctor from the neighbourhood... ...called Rémy le Haudoin, of whom she has blindfolded the eyes for the sake of carefulness. A few sips of a delicious elixir bring down the fever of the injured man and send him to a refreshing sleep.

From the monitoring of the duke of Mayenne and his brother, the duke of Guise, he learns... ...that the leaders of the league against the huguenots are hatching a plot against the king. When the rallying point of the conspirators happens to be the abbey of Saint Genevieve, he goes... ...in search of his friend, the monk Gorenflot, who belongs to that order, in the hope of gathering more information. He finds him at the inn "The Horn of Plenty", in front of a sparse meal. To loosen his tongue, the tricky Chicot treats him on good wine. The jester worms little by little the secrets from the clouded mind of Gorenflot. He also obtains the coin that opens the door of the abbey to the conspirators. Draped in the monk's habit, Chicot penetrates in the chapel of Saint Genevieve, where, in the role... ...of Gorenflot, he holds a flaming argument against the huguenots and their protector, Henry III. After the congratulations of the members, Chicot attends from his hiding place the coronation... ...of the duke of Anjou as king of France by the duke of Guise and the count of Monsoreau. To rob Diana of all support, Monsoreau has informed her father, ...of the failure of his rescue and confirmed her drowning.

It's only at Méridor that Bussy realizes Monsoreau's insensitivity. He persuades the bereaved father in tears to accompagny him to Paris. Before the house of Diana: A great joy awaits them. "Diana! Diana!... My child... alive..." Even though he knows himself found, Monsoreau doesn't admit his defeat yet. He receives the duke's anger, who demands only Diana, with an icy smile. "You will present she who is still my wife to the king this very day... Else I reveal what has passed at the chapel of Saint-Genevieve, mylord!" At the announcement to the king of her union to the man that she loaths, Diana feels herself falter. Henry III, a prince who undertakes today a procession of penitance, ...to hold tomorrow a luscious orgy with his favorites, ...is unpredictable in his friendships. Only Chicot, jester and squire, ...has never had to undergo an offensive plan of his. "Your eternal majesty permits me, to present him Diana de Méridor, countess of Monsoreau?" The irrevocable marriage of Diana, whom he loves, has thrown Bussy into illness. For the first time, he refuses to follow his master, the duke of Anjou. The duke has hardly left the house, or Remy asks his master to follow him with a mysterious air. Bussy sees her, whom he thought almost lost, give him a signal to approach. "And who tells you, monsieur de Bussy, that I belong to him whose name... ...I carry? I despise him and return to Méridor tomorrow with my father." Chicot has warned the king of the conspiracy. While the duke of Anjou... ...is held prisonner at the Louvre, the members have to be arrested. How Chicot conducts the missions the king, his lord, entrusts him. We notify you of the order to make certain for the present... ...of the hate? of the person of Monsieur de Bussy, ...count of Clermont, who has severely offended us, for which reason, ...with god's help, we have the obligation to smite him.

Roland, Bussy's steed monture knows the way and flies lie the wind. Flowery greetings. Against all expectation the duke of Anjou has returned, more dangerous than ever, ...because he still loves you. I will do everything to foil his intention of going to visit you. Guessing himself betrayed Monsoreau accuses Saint-Luc of conspiring... ...with Bussy and provokes him to a duel. Saint-Luc leaves him for dead. Monsoreau broods on revenge. "Diana is a widow, and I believe that right now, the stay at Angers hasn't become dangerous for me." After the duel. Meanwhile, the queen-mother has arrived at Angers to reconcile the duke with... ...his royal brother. Bussy whispers the replies to his master through a doorframe. My dear friend, The count of Monsoreau has accused me of being in league... ...with the shadow that he says he saw with Diana. We've come to a discussion... ...full of irritation, during which my sword caught him in a way... ...so unhappy, that he found himself struck dead. I make for Paris. St. Luc "Remy, in the saddle, and charge to Meridor!" Remy finds the count of Monsoreau still alive. His medical profession dictates him... ...one duty, to care of the injured, even if it concerns mortal enemies of his master. "I'll haste myself to the chateau to ask for thelp there." The duke of Anjou learns of the death of Monsoreau from the mouth of Bussy. In good spirits to know the traitor's death, he sets out for Meridor. The astonishment of the duke is the measure of Bussy's disappointment. To remove his wife from the duke's attentions, Monsoreau takes her with him to Paris with Remy. Bussy, who has alerted the king of the duke of Anou's return, secretly follows the retinue. While Bussy pays a visit to his wellbeloved, Monsoreau shadows... ...the duke of Anjou, whom he still suspects of a secret affair with Diana. The feast of Corpus Christi.
