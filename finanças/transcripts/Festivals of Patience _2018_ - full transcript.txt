(chalkboard eraser noise) (old film crackles) (dramatic rock guitars) - There are reasons far beyond, all in life that one can know. Reasons which won't be explained, just because we want it so. But within them, goodness lies, despite the tears a lifetime cries. Beyond the hurt, beyond the pain, eternal bliss is ours to gain. There's a battle to be fought, with the demons in our heart, for the kingdom in our soul, to which love unlocks the door. (leaves crackling ) And say goodbye, to all your tragic dreams and soon forgotten sorrows. (subway station booming) - Michael, come on. Come on, get up. Get up, lad, let's get you home. - [Michael] Leave me alone. - Come on, Michael, you're gonna get arrested. Up we go. - No. No! (both groaning) (siren wails) (vehicles honking) (upbeat lounge music) - [John] He arrives from Paris tonight. - Away? - Three months, hired to write. Ah, but here he comes. Welcome back, young Michael Fiorelli. Why good sir, what could possibly bring such a prestigious writer as yourself to such a shabby site? - Surely not you, oh sexy John, but perhaps this full moon, seducingly strange night. Nonetheless, I'm here. - That you are, that you are. (glasses clinking) All's well, I see? - As well as well can be. And you, what tales have you to tell? - Of life, of love, false or true? (chuckles) What can I say? Not much is new, but come, it's you who's just returned, so please tell of all the midnight oils burned. - If only it were so, though sadly, no. I was locked in a cell. Okay, a Parisian shack, writing and writing, couldn't wait to get back. - Really? But enfante, Paris, I thought it was the city of love and glee. - Paris is lovely, yes indeed. I just wish I'd had more time-- (romantic piano music) (people chattering) Dear John, what ardent, passionate light I see. Through my skin and to my heart, ablaze her glare sets me. Glimmering, radiant beauty. - Oh, Michael, awaken, for fair as this young maiden be, fool yourself only you shall, with such intensity. - Too late now for looks at least, proof of goodness yet to see, wish me luck. What grace does shine through soft, fair skin and wakens every sense, but what's it's done to this here heart, only your love can make amends. - Sweet young boy, whose eyes all too anxiously devour what they see, and those words, to which silk must have but lost a million battles, what do you want with me? - Only to avow that which my heart believes, by seeing your soul, so radiant and pure, it must but be the inner spark that blares aloud through gorgeous eyes and angel's soft, fair skin. - Speak no more, at least not now. It is soft silk those words, they imitate, weaving loving thoughts, my heart they penetrate. Obscure thoughts in my mind accelerate the beating of my heart and oddly, though, please speak again. Gentle, cradle, my heart mend. - My lips, my heart does guide, and speak to you, fair angel of light, I shall, but come; let us leave now, somewhere beneath the sweet moonlight. - Common male! That you are to drag me from my friend, into a dark, oh night so cold, what is it you pretend? - To know your heart and search your soul for all that which is true, and it be a pureness that I find, In love I'll fall with you. - To these words and in these arms too quickly I could fall... yet life's misery, more so quickly I recall. - So black-hearted human ways, have pierced and harmed your heart, I do so sense their base, impure, oh pain-inflicting art. - So shall we chat? Come, sit and hear more than you'd wish to know, though I'm certain after this, no more sweet words, you'll only go. - Speak and say that which you shall, fair warning though I give you now, no matter what your words may be; shock I've heard, all thunder and emotion, nonetheless, my love prevails, pure and true with all devotion. - Assure me not, for we shall see, if loving words prove true to be. So much to say but where to start? - It matters not, just speak your heart. - An introduction, that sounds nice, and for a start, it shall suffice. (upbeat piano music) Sarah Andrews. - Sarah Andrews. - Why what a lovely name, who would've thought it'd be the same. - (chuckles) Lovely name for lovely dame, and Michael Fiorelli, that's my name. Now, what more have you to say? - You wish to know, so ask away. - Fair enough, if it's this game that we shall play, what's your favorite color, favorite song, and favorite day, Favorite hour, favorite pet, favorite genius intellect, Favorite movie, favorite scene, favorite sport, and favorite team? - Okay, all right, I'll let you breathe. Silver, majestic, striking is it's shine, Favorite song escapes my mind. Sunday's calm, I guess, all right, but I love wild Friday night. 12:00 a.m., not night nor day, cats are best in every way. Da Vinci, shockingly ahead of his time, "Pretty Woman," I forget the line. Rough and tough football I choose, 49ers, win or lose. I think that's all, if I recall. - Now catch your breath before you fall. (Sarah giggles) - Intense and wistful, all you say, have you always been this way? Don't get me wrong, I judge you not, I do so love your every thought, but how indeed you do convert, to burning passion every word? - The answer is you... You need not ask, for words become a simple task; with beauty such before my eyes, my breath but mumbles that which my heart sighs. Now, words, more sounds from you again, and into bliss my heart you'll send. - Well and fair, to these words I can't refuse, but to listen, you did choose. Though I forewarned, not all is bright, Dark, perhaps, darker than night. My childhood was fun, my mom, my dad, my brother and I, but then my brother had to die. His death is not where I should start, at 17, she broke his heart. I do say she, for I hate her name. My brother's death on her I blame. To kill his pain, the one within, his choice of drug, heroin. Of all the drugs, the one he chose quickly killed him, overdose. Mom and Dad didn't last long, Dad claimed everything was wrong, so he packed up and went his way, and with my mother I did stay. - I'm sorry, but I'm also most impressed, at the ease with which your sorrows are confessed. - I've had much practice, you could say, two years of counseling every other day. High school years were shot to hell, of pleasant times, there's none to tell. Too soon, too quick did things go bad, for young, naive met senior Brad. At 15, my love I'd met, a love forever I'd regret. Brad brought sex and drugs along, and you don't refuse when your love's so strong. Either way, we didn't last, and there's no way to change your past. So bad habits soon become addictions, and when broken-hearted, to hell with all convictions. Nothing ever lasts. God, I hate to feel this way, please don't say that you won't stay. - How could I dare to leave, one minute apart would break my heart. You offer more than I could ask, too simple, pleasurable a task. Now, to make some sort of vow. - That you'll hold me forever and always, just as you do now? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. (romantic piano music) (both laughing) A thousand times, yes. Bless this night and praise these stars. Ungrateful, we shan't be, for this night of love unveiled bliss and placed you next to me. (romantic orchestral music) - Dawn? Too soon our night is gone. Oh God, look at the time, Alexa will think I was out of my mind. - Out of your mind but not your heart and soul, love is something you can't control. Don't explain, just let things be, I know John too will question me. - You're right, but I must go. - Wait, when will I see you again? This I must know. - Tonight, and not a second later. When the sun falls and shadows rise, my soul will accelerate the beating of my heart until it looks into your eyes. - Then grant me but one last request. - To comply, I'll do my best. - One last embrace before we part, this indeed will ease my heart. - How could I but dare say no, when I too wish this wish before I go. (romantic orchestration) Goodnight, and swift, my return, only with passion, shall your heart burn. Oh, and this to ease your wait. - Morning slowly bleeds its way through a dark night's flesh, so as to lay the moon down for its rest. For all that rise, must surely fall, as did my sad heart, after all. Goodnight, sweet moon, goodnight.

And your day, how's it been? - Nothing worthy of a grin, two fights and then more teenage drama; "She called me what? "Uh-uh, I ain't no slut. "That's your momma." (laughs) - Ugh I know... So? - For weeks and weeks, I wait and wait, but how I do now hesitate. - Come on, come on, it's getting late. Open it. (paper tearing) Don't sweat it, John, forget it. They've no clue how good you are. You're a scholar, a gentleman, and star. - Don't worry, I'm used to these already, what's the saying, something, something slow and steady? - Right. So poker tonight, your place? - The cards are ready, ace. Lookin' forward to changing my luck. - (chuckles) Last time, you were down to your last buck. - Well not tonight, so you'd best tell the boys to bring their money. - All right, I'll see ya later, honey. (John chuckles) - [John] Come on. (bell tolls) - Michael, what a pleasant surprise. And you've got my book, isn't that nice? - Good morning, Father, that and so much more. - Oh, so it's good news you have in store. Please, please, do share. - I feel... I'm floating in midair. I can still see her eyes, I can still smell her hair. What a marvelous night, I'm still under her spell. - Michael, not again, these things never fare well. You dive in too soon, too deep, can't you tell? - Not this time, Father, she's unlike any other. I'm certain this time, true love has walked right through my door. - And what on earth in one night can make you so sure? And don't say her eyes, her beautiful smile. - Her beauty is undeniable, but it's her soul that's aglow and so worth the while. For despite her past regrets, there's a spark in her eyes of childlike purity, still untarnished by life's sorrows and cruelty. She's aware of her faults, of the place from which they stem. - And you aim to polish this rough gem. Be cautious then. It's often lovers who are far too blind to see, that fall in love with each other's faults and not reality. - I'm not sure I follow. Are her faults not her own, do they not represent who she is, how she's grown? Is it perfection I should seek and if so, where to find? - Perfection is solely on the cross, not of this earth nor of this time. Seek truth, but venture slowly, keep both feet on the ground. For foolish hearts hurt even more, when love is carelessly profound. Take your time, and be pious, for piety rewards tenfold, (chuckles) as I'm sure throughout your years you've constantly been told. - I have, and thank you, Father, for your words and your concern. From words of wisdom, even the wisest still can learn. (Conor chuckles) (paper crunches) (Michael sighs) (door clacks) What time is it? - Why, hi John, how are you, how was your day? - I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a fray, can't seem to get her out of my mind all day. - Oh, that's right, your angel of light. You're seeing her tomorrow? - No, tonight. - Oh, I see, but what about poker? - [Michael] You'll have to do without me. - Chickening out already. - Oh, how you wish. Don't you worry, I'll take your money soon enough. - [John] Anytime, I'll call your bluff. - Touche. So, how was your day? - Mundane, and then this came. - You're not smiling. - It's the same. If I ever showed promise, where on earth did it go? Stuck forever in high school was not the plan, you know? - I know. Just keep sending 'em your stuff, one is bound to bite. - They did once before. - [Michael] Right. - So, if you're seeing her tonight, why so anxious, why so agitated? - I don't know. I fear that spark, that inexplicable intensity, may have perhaps already faded. - Well, worry not, I'm sure it's fine, perhaps she too's been anxious all this time. - Don't say that, I wish upon her no ill thought, no desperation. - Even if it means your kiss is her salvation? - Even then, John, even then. (bottles clinking) (mellow rock music) - Here, have some wine to calm you down. You're acting so weird, as if you hadn't been around. - Well, that's not nice. - You know what I mean. - You don't have to be so mean. He's different, I really do think this could be love. - Ugh - Ugh, why? Just because you find love so trite and frivolous, what gives you the right to curse it for the rest of us? - Damn. Well, don't be so profound, I'm happy for you, for the love that you've found. Cheers, to Sarah and Mitchell. - [Sarah] Michael. - Right, Michael. (glasses clinking) (Alexa sniffs) - [Sarah] No thanks, I'm good. - Well, well, well, how we've changed indeed. - Yeah, I guess so, maybe that crap, I no longer need. See ya.

I could tell right away, he had that strange look. - You mean the one where he looks right through you, floating in space in his lovely love bubble? - (chuckles) That's the one. - I think we're in trouble. - He'll be fine. - [Richy] Not this time. - [Father Conor] Just have him take it slow, you're his friends, give him advice, let him know.

(vehicle honks) - She's a dream, John, she's a dream. Love like this, this day and age, is rarely ever seen. If with my owns hands, hers I'd not held, I'd think I was dreaming, under some spell. But she's real, John, she's real. - It's this passion, this fever within you that rages, ignoring all the wisdom handed down throughout the ages. Caution, caution, dead ahead. This love of which you speak, it makes your reason weak, clouds of bliss clutter your brain, disperse to hell, any thought that's sane. - And if for love, I risk not all, tell me then of a worthier call, or a better time. Perhaps when I'm older, let this one slip by, let the falls just grow colder? - Very well, do as you please. But a better time might be, when the one you love threatens not to damage, as does she. Regardless of your choice, your friend I'll always be, and when a shoulder is in need, you can count on me. - Thank you, and fear not, for love cradles my heart. (chuckles) I think I know of the solution, to ease your disillusion. My love you soon shall meet, and find she's more than sweet. I believe she's got a friend, I'll make sure she comes along, you could use a little drink, a little dance, a little song. - So, you're an actress, Michael did say. - Just finished her 17th play. Amazing to behold, so glamorous, so natural. If only I could be so bold. - Honey, you too are amazing. Look at you! You've got just what it takes. You just have to let go, take your foot off the brakes. - Maybe, I don't know. - So when's your next show? - Not for a while, it's time to stake my claim: Hollywood's the name of the game. - I see, wow, congratulations. But Los Angeles is far, have you no reservations? - No, I've nothing to lose, and nothing standing in my way. It's losers who fear, worry day to day. - Well, that's quite harsh, wouldn't you say? Somebody may be careful, but it doesn't merit insult so dreadful. - I guess that's why you're both so successful. - Alexa. - Michael's quite talented, I guess you don't know. He just got back from Paris, has written a show. - A small play for some bourgeois institution. They wanted a modern tale of the French Revolution. - I'll say you're overly modest. Small as it may have been, I read the reviews, it did very well. - Well, bravo! (John laughs) Sarah, who knew? - Cheers to you. - So which do you prefer, film or theater? - Film, of course, there's a lot more money to be made, and the fame is even more so great. - Big dreams, hard to reach. - And what do you do again? Oh, right, you teach. - John was actually gonna write for The Times. He had gotten the job and was on his way... - But I changed my mind and I'm perfectly happy this way. You see, Alexa, I don't think fortune and fame can complete you, but if you simply love what you do, happiness will come to greet you. - So, when are you moving out to LA? - In just a few weeks, end of May. Sarah is helping me move out there. - Oh, you don't say? - Yeah, don't worry. I'm not going out there to stay, just a week or two at most. - Well, to you, Alexa, here's a toast. (chuckles) (glasses clinking) - Okay, so a teacher? Ugh, what's that all about? - You don't have to act out. He was on his way, job in hand. His father died, heart attack. Mom got sick, so much for that. And on top of that, his girlfriend left him for some guy in upstate New York. - What a dork. - Don't be mean. I think it's sweet he gave it all up to take care of his mom. - Well, I think it's dumb. He could've put her in care. And what about his dreams, his life, his girlfriend? (scoffs) I guess to think of that, oh no, he wouldn't dare. - I can't believe you see it that way. What if it was your mother? - Mom's dead, remember? Don't bother. (Alexa sniffs) Hmm? - I have to admit, I'm somewhat perplexed. Sarah seems kind, the other, quite vexed. - They grew up together, childhood friends, though it's clear she's a bad influence. - Ah, well, good luck with that. - What, you're not staying? - [John] Only if you're buying... Come on, I'm just playing. - Well, hello again. - So, who's your friend? - What, you've yet to mention me? - Huh? Oh, it's a game, I see. Nice, you had me going. - [Kate] So what am I pouring? - Shots, if you would be so kind. - Tequila? - And beer, if you don't mind. - Mind? Why, not in the least. - Look at you, you sexy beast! - Cut it out. She's nice, huh? - Yeah, duh. - Here you go, hun. Come back for more. - God, you're such a bore. - (chuckles) They should really turn up the air. - Yeah, it's hot in here. - You gonna share? (John chuckles) Oh, you're cute. What's your name? Wanna play a drinking game? - Wow, well, that didn't take long. - [Michael] No, you're wrong. - This is not what it looks like. - Right, I don't even know what to say. - These girls are drunk. - Hey! - Sarah, we're leaving, now. - Sarah, wait. - What? - I don't know that girl, she's wasted, she sat on my lap, you walked out just as she sat. - (scoffs) And you're sticking to that? - Yes, why would I lie? I'm not that guy. - It's fine, I believe you. - But let's call it a night, huh? We should go, it just feels right. - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. (phone dings) - It's Sarah. I guess we're okay. She's asking to meet, I should go right away. - Michael, be careful. I was not too impressed, and Alexa, she seems like the devil, just a bit better dressed. - Goodnight, and don't worry, I'm sure I'll be fine. (upbeat rock music) - It's precisely those words that don't ease my mind.

He's a stockbroker I met the other night. He drives a Porsche. - Oh, so he's just right. (laughs) - So far, so good, we're going to Tao later tonight. You two should come along. - I don't know. - I'm sorry, it's a work thing. I'm gonna have to call it a night. - Oh, that's all right. Sarah and I were just saying how long it's been since we've hung out. - Great, so you two will have fun, no doubt. We'll do it soon. - Mm-hmm. - Gotta run. (smooches) (upbeat synth music) - Screw him, let's have fun. - Yeah, sure, you wanna join us? - No, but let's discuss. Girls' night out? Come on, Sarah, it's been so long. It'll be fun. - I don't know, hun, I'm out with Michael. - (scoffs) You are always out with Michael. Please? I'm all alone, all dressed up with nowhere to go. - Okay, all right, I'll let him know. - Yay, my bestie's back! (both giggling) - Well, look what the cat dragged in. - Dressed in black and ready to sin. - Told you so. - Hi John, how are you? Richy, right? We've met before? - A few times, I'm pretty sure. - Hi Alexa, it's nice to see you too. Where's your date? - He had to work late. It's a drag, but whatever. Sarah's gonna make it all better. - Really? - Is that okay, girls' night out? I'll make it up to you. - You don't have to. Go have fun, I'll see you back at my place. - Ooh, how sweet, just look at that face!

(door creaks) - Are you high? Did you get high? - We were dancing, and there was some guy, he gave it to Alexa and I. - And you got high. Great. Awesome, I don't know what to say. - Stop it, Michael, please, another day. I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. I got drunk, I wasn't thinking. - Maybe it's time you quit drinking. Look, Sarah, I'm not trying to be a prude, but this, this shit isn't good. I've lost good friends, it's a downward spiral. You can't just give in. - I know. I'm trying. I'm sorry. You know that I have. - I know. I know. Sleep now, love. (busy street sounds) (Sarah giggles) How'd it go? - Hi. (smooches) How'd you know? - You told me, remember? - Oh, that's right. Well, I won't be an equity member. - They don't know what you're worth. - At least I have you on this earth. Let's grab a drink. - It's a little bit early, don't you think? How 'bout a coffee instead? - Okay, but not that one cafe I dread. - No, of course not. (Sarah giggles) Come on. (Sarah laughs) (phone rings) Which means he's not technically-- - Hold on. (laughs) Hi, Mom. Mom, what's wrong? (dramatic piano music) What? No, I'm fine. I love you too. - What's wrong? What's going on? Sarah? - It's my dad. He's dead. - I'm sorry, love, I'm so sorry. - I'm not. - Sarah? - What? He was my dad, and he just left. Now he's gone again. I loved him, but I won't pretend that now I hate him even more than I have all these years before. What gives him the right, the goddamn right to now come into light out of nowhere and for what? - Don't say that, Sarah. I know you're hurting, but you have to forgive him. You have to find a way to let go. - Sure, Michael, if you say so. - Look, lay him to rest. Rid yourself of that anger in your chest. Send it away, don't hold it in. - To hate this much must be a sin. I'm not going. I don't give a damn, I'm not going. He's not going to win. - Win what, Sarah? It's over. If you don't let it go, he does win, win over your soul, over your peace of mind, over you for all time. You need to let it go. - Looks like there's nothing you don't know, huh, Michael? You're always so damn right! - Don't take this out on me, on us. It's not right. - I gotta go. I'm sorry, I just have to go. (dramatic orchestral music) - Sarah, wait! Sarah! Sarah! (engine rumbles) (siren wails) (busy city street sounds) - [Kate] Michael, listen, you need to come down. It's Sarah, she's drunk and stumbling around. (upbeat rock music) - [Michael] Baby, Sarah. - Oh, hey. - Are you okay? - [Alexa] She's fine, Michael, let her be. - She doesn't need drinks! She needs me. - Oh, sure, lover boy, you're just everyone's savior. Don't get out of hand, watch your bad behavior. - What is your problem? - [Sarah] Michael, leave her alone. She's taking care of me. I need this. - This? What is this? Getting trashed to the point where you can no longer walk? Sarah, please, let's go talk. - There's nothing to say. I told you, today, I don't care. - See? She's well aware. Just let her live, let her be. - Alexa, get away from me. - Oh, you are my hero, coming to save me. Cheers to my hero. - [Michael] Sarah, please, no. Love, look at me. This is not what you need. - What do I need, Michael? Love? Love? Love? Love? Bullshit! No more love, none so true to which devotion is deserved! All that I've had, all that I've loved rotted with poison or poisoned to rot! I've nothing left! But don't complain, I'll give what I can. - Then you'll give pain.

I'm having trouble processing my thoughts, I can hardly even write. - I take it Sarah is not yet back, right? - Right, but I'm not sure that's entirely the problem. I think there's more to it than her being away. - I see. Well, by all means, speak freely, speak away. - It was right before she left the other night. She got high, we had a fight, and ever since, I feel something's not right. You've known me since I was younger. To find true love has been like a hunger. I don't know why quite often I feel so alone, longing for someone to call my own, a partner in crime, to make me whole, to fill that aching gap in my soul. And Sarah, I'm certain she's the one, she's incredible and I love her already, even though it's not been that long. - Michael, perhaps that's what wrong. But before I sound like I'm preaching, please go on. - Sarah's got a past, as I did once say, but in truth, don't we all in some way? I know she wants to change, or at least I hope that's her conviction. Though I'm sensing her habits, less leisure, leaning closer to addiction. I know I can help her if I just give her, if just show her-- - That you love her? (dramatic piano music) Michael, you can't change her, nor can you be her savior. - I don't want to change her. Okay, maybe her behavior, at times. But aren't we taught to do all that we can for others, to be good Christian brothers? - Yes, we are but don't confuse or cleverly choose to interpret God's teachings to do as you choose. You can't will her to change, you'll only lose. - What am I supposed to do? What does everyone expect, that I just walk away? It's not gonna happen, Father, no way. - I'm not saying walk away. But if her love for you is reciprocal, she'll do what she has to do. But don't think for one second that your love will change her, save her, be some healing, cleansing gown. If she's to truly change her ways, it must come from her, from somewhere deep down. - That's precisely what I don't understand. Shouldn't I be her helping hand, the one that pulls her from the sinking sand? - Oh, Michael, that's a thin line and a delicate one, too. Is it you doing the pulling or is it down she's pulling you? Are you ready to crucify yourself for her sins? Can you carry that cross? - If I don't, isn't it all already a loss? The truth is I don't know, but I'm willing to see how far I can go. I have to try, it's all I can do. - Then godspeed and strength to you. I'll be praying for you both. I suggest you calmly speak out your concerns. Set aside that passion that burns. Try to explain what's at stake and what's to gain. - That indeed does sound sane, sane and rational advice. Thank you, Father, once again. You are a wise and good friend. - To my sheep, I'll always tend. And while God grants me the time, I, in return, shall grant you mine. But more importantly, know that God above is there for you and always will be. For thus His love spans throughout time for all eternity.

No way, I thought you said tomorrow. - Surprise, lover, no more waiting in sorrow. - If only I had a car I could borrow. I wanted to pick you up at the airport. You really shoulda told me. - Yet this is much sweeter, don't you agree? Are you gonna keep talking away? Pretty soon, it'll be tomorrow, not today. - (laughs) Right, no, I'm on my way. (sentimental piano music) So, how was LA? I'm sure you've got a million stories, do tell. - LA's amazing, who knew? And of course, for Alexa, a real dream come true. - So Alexa got on well, I figured as much, though I'm surprised you liked it as well. - Well, I can't say I miss the smell. The sun, the palm trees, beautiful sky, I can see myself out there, I'm not gonna lie. - I hope not without me. You know I'd just die. (Sarah chuckles) - And John and Kate, how are they? - Really well, saw them the other day. They're actually moving in together. Can you believe it? (chuckles) - No. Wow. Going legit, that's great. - I know. Ironic, they met on our double date. - That's right, I almost forgot. - Alexa and John, definitely not. (Sarah laughs) About what happened when you left, I know you said it's something you'd rather forget, but I've been giving it a lot of thought-- - I'd rather not. But I know, I've thought about it, too, and I'm sorry if I hurt you. - I'm afraid the one who's hurting's really you. I think we should talk more about your past and the things that ail you. - Michael, no, I don't want to. I hate reliving my past. I'd rather focus on our future, make it last. - [Michael] Well, there won't be much of a future, not while this shadow's cast. - You mean me getting high? Look, I'm scared too, I won't lie. I thought I was done, but then I'm out, I get drunk, and it's fun. At least, I mean, it's not like I'm high all the time. - Is that supposed to give me peace of mind? Look, you should really quit this crap while you can. It's not who you are and it's not who I know you can be. - So if I don't quit, what? You'll go? Leave me? (Michael sighs) Great, what a fantastic date. - Move in with me. - Move in? How will that fix anything? - I don't know, but I do know how much I missed you. When I laid eyes on you this afternoon, all my doubts were gone. I know you weren't away for that long, but I thought about you every second of every day, of the things you did say. You said we needed time. I couldn't get your eyes out of my mind. - I missed you too, and I also couldn't stop thinking about the way we left things, the fights, the drinking. Michael, I want to change. I want to be that girl you want, the good you see in me. - Sarah, you are good. You're changing and you're trying. You just gotta trust in yourself. Trust in us, believe. - But what if it's your trust and love that I deceive? I don't want to hurt you, and I'm afraid. - Then let me hold you and let your heart be swayed.

How's that fellowship, did you apply? - Not just yet. - Why? - I've been busy. Relationships are hard man, no lie. - That's why it's solo I fly, keeps me feeling breezy. (laughs) - That's a bit cheesy. Then again, I'm one to talk. I know it's my affairs you always mock. - No, man, we're proud of you. This one seems to be going well. - Can you tell? It is. It's okay, I guess. Few ups and downs, but more smiles than frowns. - Good for you, Michael, good for you. And John, hey, looks like you're contagious, I'd best stay away. - (chuckles) When it hits you, it hits you, what can I say. So, you think he's doing okay? We've not had a heart-to-heart in a while. - Well, Kate's certainly making him smile. (Michael chuckles) But I'm a bit concerned about him in regards to his writings. He keeps sending things off and still no one's biting. It's pretty demotivating, I feel for the guy. - Well, I have an idea that might be worth a try. The fellowship is fully paid for with promising prospects once completed. I think it could reinflate his confidence, the one sorely depleted. I'm applying for him without him knowing. This way, should he not get in, it won't be so bad. Okay, maybe just a tad. Then again, ignorance is bliss. - True, but it's you who'll have to carry this. I see that you're trying to be helpful as you always are, but you're playing with John's dreams. You don't want to leave a scar. - I know, I'm conflicted, but I think it's worth a shot. He's losing motivation, and we both know he should not. He's good, Richy. He just needs another chance. - I think he's just tired of the same old song and dance. But you're right, he is good, we both know it. He just needs one open door so he can show it. - So I guess it's a go. - Let's just hope it's not a no. I'll catch you later. - Later, gator. (phone buzzes) - Hello? Oh, hi, yes, this is he. You got my work, that's great. And you like it! Thank you, that's, that's wonderful. I'm sorry, I'm not following. A writer's workshop, uh-huh.

No more serving drinks to every horny jerk. - Well, that's a relief. I'm in disbelief, so when do you start? - Soon, I enrolled today and I have a full cart. The amount of books, who knew? They're quite costly, too. - Don't worry, love, I can help you cover it. I've got the upcoming fellowship, some residuals, and a few small jobs. We'll be just fine, go enlighten your mind. - I can't wait. Thank you, Michael. I love you so much. Thank you, baby. (smooches) - So shall we go be thankful in the bedroom? - (laughs) Maybe.

Were those the days when dreams were planned to live, but never came to be? Reality was still then fiction, or the hopes and imagination of a sparkling youth. Harshness was but a gentle scrape or bruise. And pain... was only when you cried. Sarah? Where's your head? Have you even listened to a word I've said? - Do we need more bread? It's on sale. - Well, this relationship is getting stale. Bread? Are you serious? - What? Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to be concentrating on you? Like I'm always supposed to, listening to how great you are, how great you're doing? I'm sick of applauding, Michael. I feel like booing. - What the hell is wrong with you? What did I do, for me to deserve this? Since when is my success an issue? - Oh, are you upset? Here, here's a tissue. - [Michael] Sarah, love, please, what is this? What's going on? (wine splashes) - I don't know, Michael. I think I'm just sick of this song. We're an old couple and we're not even married. I'm tired and wearied. This is not what I envisioned, this sappy ever-after. It's been sucked dry of any genuine smiles and laughter. - What you envisioned? So please do enlighten me. What role in your epic saga have I not lived up to be? I haven't changed, Sarah. I'm still the same, still caring, still loving, still giving and, yes, still breathing. - Right, you're still the same. But for me, change is the name of the game, right? Not for you, the perfect intellect. It's me who has to learn, grow up, stop drinking, be kinder, more caring, quicker at thinking. Can't you see it? Our little love boat is sinking. - Okay, sure, we can play this pity game, pretend our love is merely an illusion. But it won't suffice to do away with this confusion. I'm riddled by your words. Please, what are you on? - Oh, what am I on? Good one, of course the little junkie has to be on something. Fuck you. - Sarah, enough! What the hell is going on? - I'm tired, Michael! I'm tired of this song! I'm sick of it, I'm bored! I want something more! I'm sick of school, I'm sick of you, I'm sick of me. I'm sick of what my life's come to be. It just isn't me. It's not what I want, I want to be free. - Free? Free like Alexa, just whore yourself out for money and fame, is that what you want? - No, she's not a whore! She's got guts to go out and chase her dreams, her dreams, not anyone else's, not yours, certainly. - So what do you want? What are your dreams, Sarah? I thought we would reach them together. Didn't we say that would be better, better than alone? - I still feel alone, (dramatic piano music) even when you're home. I don't want this anymore, Michael. - What do you mean? You mean us? Do I not have a say in this? Is there nothing to discuss? - No. There's nothing to discuss. Maybe just our living arrangement. - Estrangement. - It doesn't have to be that way. I think we can stay friends. I still care for you, and I haven't got the means. - The means? (chuckles) Oh, you mean money? - It's not funny. I figure we could maybe live together for some time. I'll work, save up to move out. - Are you out of your mind? You want me to live with you but us not be together? - I think it's a minor issue we can weather. We've been through worse by now, have we not? - That's it. You're nuts. You're insane by a long shot! - Okay, you're clearly really upset. We can talk about it when I get back. - When you get back? Back from where? Please slap me across the face and wake me the fuck up! Your indifference is heart-wrenching enough, so a slap might only help! I love you. I love you. I love you. What have I done wrong? What am I doing wrong? I've done nothing but love you all along. - It's not you, okay? It's me. - How much more damn cliche can you be? - I'm leaving, Michael. I'm late. - Late, for what? A date? You've gotta be fucking kidding me, right? Oh my god, tonight? - [Sarah] It's not a date, it's just a friend. - You want to live under the same roof and fuck other men? Who are you, you monster? And where the fuck is my girlfriend? (dramatic orchestral music) Fuck! (fridge bangs) (luggage clatters) (zipper crunches) (door knocks) - [Kate] Just a second. (lock clacks) Michael? What's going on? - [John] Michael. Kate, can we have a minute, hun? - Of course. - No, it's okay. Kate, you can stay. Can I crash with you guys for some time? - Of course, that's absolutely fine. You stay as long as you need. - [John] So what now? What's with all your stuff? - I left. I called her bluff. Or at least I'm hoping that's all it was. Perhaps after I'm gone, she'll realize what she's lost. Maybe she'll understand that what we have is truly worth fighting for. - Are you keeping score? Listen to yourself. You're throwing punches in the air and for what? She doesn't even care. She's gone, Michael. I think she's been gone for a while, if she was ever even there. - Did she ever even care? (dramatic piano music) John, (sighs) what the hell am I supposed to do? Look, just don't tell her where I am. If she comes around or calls, just say you don't know. - [John] What for, Michael, what's this little show? - It's not a show. It's my life. She was supposed to be my wife. Hi. - Michael, hi. Alexa just stopped by. (keys clinking) She dropped off your keys. (dramatic piano music) - What? Alexa, why? No, please. - She didn't say anything. She just dropped them off and left. Michael, wait.

So easy to go all but insane at the thought of love and torture of rejection. But sweet life, I did once love. My stomach now fills as to explode with streams of blood from that remains of my ravaged heart. - Oh, Michael, awaken. For fair as this young maiden be, fool yourself only you shall with such intensity. - Too late now for looks at least, proof of goodness yet to see, wish me luck. - [Father Conor] Michael, come on. Come on, get up. Get up, lad, let's get you home. - [Michael] Leave me alone. - Come on, Michael, you're gonna get arrested. Up we go. - No. - No! (both groaning) (dramatic orchestral music) - You can't keep doing this, Michael. It's not good for you, my boy. You can't do this to yourself. - To myself? To myself? I've done nothing to myself. - Michael, calm down, shh, it's all right. It'll be all right. The Lord knows you're in pain, but from drinking, there's nothing you can gain. You're only causing yourself harm. - I'm sorry. (sobs) Am I now cause for alarm? Does my state trouble you, Father? Well, look away! I'm a lost cause, don't even bother! - God never loses His sheep, never lets them go. Even in your current state, this you should know. - Go? Go! Well, He sure as hell let her go, and I'm pretty sure He's not bringing her back, not for me. There must be something I lack, something that deems me not worthy of love. (laughs) Oh, thank you, Lord above! - Michael, enough, get yourself together! (Michael cries) God is not to blame for your despair. - That's right. He doesn't even care. My pain is pitiful, pathetic. So why are you here? If it's pity, shed a tear and leave me the hell alone. For my sorrows, prayer cannot atone. - [Conor] Michael, you're not alone. Will you listen to me? You are not alone.
