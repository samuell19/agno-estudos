Of all people and of all things? you? DONIPHAN: But Mom, we found this old skeleton with a key in its hand, and- GRANDPA: Key? Let me see that key! LISA: I don't care! Why would you lie to me? Why are you doing this? Only honest Abe knows. Don't you pull that on me. That stupid little phrase has haunted us for generations. You will not end up like every other failed James man in this family! [doorbell rings] [Tobi barks] I'll help him with the report. [doorbell rings] It should be on Jesse James.

DONIPHAN: It's a dead body mom!- LISA: ENOUGH! GRANDPA: that's something this family knows. We can use that to get his report up. REBECCA: Hope this isn't a bad time. LISA: No, Rebecca. It's fine. Come on in BEN: I was hoping to speak to Eddie. LISA: We can all sit right here and talk, Ben. JACKSON: Did they all just miss the entire dead body thing? GRANDPA: Whats up? BEN FORD: Montgomery won. He fired me at the plant today. Well, actually, he concocted some way to get me to transfered out of town... to Illinois. REBECCA: He's forcing Ben, Jackson and I from our home Lisa. He's gonna get the house. JACKSON: Why would he want OUR house? GRANDPA: It's not the house he wants, it's what's under that property. BEN: What? Empty caves? GRANDPA: OH They're not empty. We have been under that man's thumb as long as I can remember and paying rent on property that I know belongs to our family. LISA: No one has ever proven that Ben. [Tobi barking] REBECCA: And no one ever will. [Tobi barking] LISA: Maybe it's time that we all move... and put the curse to rest. BEN: What about the kids? LISA: For the kids.

GRANDPA: Ya know every James boy has tried to make it right and failed... Maybe we should all move away. Tuck tail and run. Or maybe we finally have a reason to fight. LISA: I will not lose my son like we lost his father. [Tobi barking] I'm NOT doing this again. We're NOT doing this again. GRANDPA: Well I guess I'm just an old man, dreamin' old dreams. LISA: Think it's time you go get started on that book report. [Tobi barking] LISA: TOBI SHUT UP! [whimpering] [Triumphant music] [sounds of battle] DONIPHAN: Man, this sucks.

GRANDPA: Yeah... Listen. DONIPHAN: Why the long face... GRANDPA: This is purely to inspire your homework assignment. Okay? Now no one ever came of any good from this here book. But in the past our family has gone after this lost treasure for all wrong reasons. Monty knows the treasure is still there otherwise he wouldn't be spending all that money going after it for so long. ["Only Honest Abe Knows"] Jesse wrote this on the first page all by itself, like he meant to tease us. Take a look, take a look boy. Look at that son, it's right here in the book! [page flips] HANDSOME: We best get a move on. NELL: Waited too long. I can feel it. Them boys got what they needed to know. What they really wanted. HANDSOME: We got to try. It's all we got. NELL: What we gonna do? A black woman is just gonna walk all fancy right on into that white man's bank and demand her property? HANDSOME: I promised Master Ford I'd get you safe. How safe you gonna be, and everyone else who lives there, with nothing!? NELL: Ain't nothin' there no more. [pistol hammer clicks] [coins rustling] JESSE: Let's make this a quick one boys. [guitar music plays] [sounds of town talking and working] [hammering] MAN: I missed you [guitar music continues] JESSE: The townsfolk don't seem to appreciate our horses. BOY: Sheriff! over there! SHERIFF: Oh no! Hey! wake up! Go get the boys! JESSE: I don't know how you ever talked me into this Robert? The only thing I want to do with the law in this town is to get to know the sheriff's daughter. ROBERT: South. Take me to the lock boxes, in the back, C'mon lets go! I want the lock box that this key opens. Jesse, I got the window! I got it! JESSE: I didn't mean you really wanted to meet the Sheriff's daughter. [gun hammer clicks] ROBERT: Open it South! SOUTH: I... I can't. It takes two keys... matching keys to open it. Your father and your mother... Mrs Ford each have... had one. JESSE: We go now or you're gonna open up a permanent account at this bank! [pistol decocks] [hit] JESSE: I swear to god you're gonna lead me to an early death. ROBERT: This box has the Ford family name on it, alright? It's my Legacy. It's mine by rights. JESSE: Sheriff's got a box with your name on it as well. I don't think you want to be dragging it around! HARRISON: WOHOO! [gunshot] [rapid gunshots] WOMAN: Hurry give me my gun! [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshots] [women screaming] [ghasp] [gunshots] [women screaming] [gunshots contiue] [trotting and gunshots] JESSE: We need a place to hunker down! Some place to hide! HARRISON: There's a cave down the valley! Know it pretty well. [gunshots] [man grunts] [gunshots] COWBOY: Dagnabbit! Whats going on out here? [gunshots] COWBOY: TARNATION! [gunshot] [horses trotting through water] [energetic music] JESSE: C'mon boys! C'mon boys, into the hole! [frantic rustling] [horses neighing] [eerie music] [gunshot] JESSE: C'mon, C'mon... The horses are spooked! POSSE: There they are! [gunshots] [eerie music intensifies] [gunshots] [deep bassy sound] [NARRATION] GRANDPA: They held up deep inside the cave with the whole town's money and the box. Now legend tells the Indians used to live in that underground kingdom until the white man came and killed them all, and made their home into an underground mining operation. Well the ghosts of those Indians still live in those caves. Jesse and Robert struck some kind of deal with these spirits to show them a way out in exchange for the treasure. HOPE: A deal with Native American ghosts? GRANDPA: Legend tells... spirits took the treasure but it wasn't enough. They wanted blood. So, they took the rest of Jesse's men. JACKSON: Let me see that! GRANDPA: Robert and Jesse escaped but not before spirits put a curse on the both of them. No one knows how they got out, and no one's ever seen the treasure. Thats why he left a trail of clues and maps in his journal, but he left out just enough information that no one could go back without him. But as the curse would have it Robert Ford shot Jesse in the back and killed him dead before he'd tell anybody where the treasure was... [thunder crashes] [thunder] [sounds of water] JACKSON: So if we find the treasure, we find the Will? And that proves that my family has always owned the land? DONIPHAN: Look, my great, great grandfather failed. His son failed. My dad... he died! All for this stupid cursed treasure!? What makes you think we'll find it! What even makes you think we'll make it? HOPE: Montgomery won't stop here. Someone has to step up and stop him. Is it dangerous? Yeah. It is. But think of what it means for both both of your families. Think of what it means for all of us. Your dad didn't have this key. You're talking about a whole unexplored underground world We don't know anything about those caves. Look right here in this book. It just looks like a maze of who knows what? And what is that? Some underground water tunnel thing? Guys we've never been in there! HOPE: This book has been there. We have more clues than anyone did before us. Jesse James always intended to go back. Maybe the time has come. This sounds like the start of an adventure. [thunder rubbling] [rain] JACKSON: Let's say we do this. I'm not saying we are, but let's just say. These caves run under woods that go on forever, all the way to the river and maybe beyond! How do we even know where to start? HOPE: Where we found the key. DONIPHAN: The Fort. But, even if we do find the lock box, it has two keys. We only have one. JACKSON: This picture shows a key that looks like it goes to a gun? Like maybe it opens the handle. HOPE: Or maybe it's in the handle. DONIPHAN: Hey! Montgomery found a pistol with a white handle while he was mining in the caves last month. It was all over everyone's phone! HOPE: No telling where he hid that. JACKSON: In plain sight. I saw it this morning in a glass case in Montgomery's office! It's right there! HOPE: You see? There's something greater going on here. It's like fate picked this moment to bring all this together. All of us together, to see what we're made of. To change history and write a new legend. Our legend. We need - CRICKET: -the second key! HOPE: CRICKET! HEY GET OUT OF HERE! JACKSON: OK, but the gun is in a glass case, locked, in Montgomery's office! How are we going to pull that off? DONIPHAN: If we can get there, I can get us in. HOPE: What do you mean? DONIPHAN: I'm a James boy! I broke into school a few times to change my grades. JACKSON: What? DONIPHAN: Middle School didn't really work out. They had an alarm system. JACKSON: You're a thief?! DONIPHAN: I never stole anything. I just... changed some grades. A few times. GRANDPA: Take the book son. You're going to need it. It's everyday good deeds that keep darkness at bay, and you kids are good. DONIPHAN: Come with us Grandpa! GRANDPA: I love a good adventure but my time has passed. I'd only hold you back. You can call me though. and I'll be like Batman's Alfred, ready to hop on those internet tubes and save the day. [laughing] DONIPHAN: You should keep hold of the key. It will be a lot safer with you, but just keep it under your shirt. HOPE: Alright, now what? DONIPHAN: If we're gonna get that pistol out of Monty's office, we're gonna need some wheels... Pippin. JACKSON: Pippin! She farts... They really smell. [dramatic music] RED CLOAK: These are not patient men I work for Monty. They get what they want... they get results. They want... their treasure. MONTGOMERY: I have the key RED CLOAK: To what? MONTGOMERY: I'm working on that. RED CLOAK: You made a deal. They are giving you three days to hold up your end of it. MONTGOMERY: I need more time than that! RED CLOAK: Three days, Monty! After that we can no longer protect you. [thunder] [ringing] PIPPIN: Hello? DONIPHAN: Pippin. It's Doniphan. I need a huge favor. I need you to meet us at the barn tomorrow right after your driver's test. Oh and no pressure. You HAVE TO PASS, or else everything is ruined! ...Okay? [door slams] MONTGOMERY: LISTEN UP! I'm only going to say this once! You're gonna get in there... you're gonna tear these caverns apart! You're gonna find my treasure and I'm gonna pay you double if that treasure is in my hand by morning! Got it? ALRIGHT! GET TO WORK! [door closes] [playful music] CRICKET: I'm feeling kinda hungry. Maybe I'll wake mom up and ask her to cook us breakfast DONIPHAN: Jeez Cricket... Fine! You can go! CRICKET: YES! JACKSON: What is he doing here!? He can't come with us! DONIPHAN: I don't wanna talk about it. CRICKET: I made sandwiches DONIPHAN: Ready for one last great adventure? JACKSON: this could be a complete waste of time. HOPE: It could be the best moment of our lives. DONIPHAN: You got something better to do? JACKSON: [sigh] Lets go DONIPHAN: If Pippin doesn't pass this morning, this could be the shortest adventure we've ever had. CRICKET: Hold this DONIPHAN: [grrr] [engine running] PIPPIN: I sweat when I'm nervous... [fart] I fart too... INSTRUCTOR: OK. Let's get THIS over with. [ignition squeals] PIPPIN: ooooh... sorry INSTRUCTOR: I need you to pull to the end of the block, and make a left PIPPIN: Okay. [silly music] [brakes squeak] INSTRUCTOR: Turn right and take it a little easier on the gas and brakes. [scrawling] PIPPIN: Pretty could... INSTRUCTOR: You passed PIPPIN: YES! INSTRUCTOR: Barely... And I mean barely. I'm gonna chalk this one up to inexpirience. Find a calm, safe place to practice... and don't make me regret this. [hip hop plays] [music stops, Pippin farts] DONIPHAN: You passed? PIPPIN: Aced it. JACKSON: What was exactly your score? PIPPIN: Aced Do you spell that with a "D"? [laughter] PIPPIN: Look, I don't see any of you here that can drive! DONIPHAN: Alright, everybody hop in. We're running out of time. I'll explain on the way. PIPPIN: Okay. I'm in CRICKET: I'm Hungry! Can we eat now? DONIPHAN: Man Jesse James was the greatest adventurer ever! JACKSON: He's also the guy who got my family kicked off the land. CRICKET: What is that? DONIPHAN: I don't know. Looks like a top hat I guess JACKSON: I still think thats water. PIPPIN: Okay so... what's going on? HOPE: Well, we have one key... CRICKET: We need the second key from monty. JACKSON: Then we use the book to find the teasure and the Will. DONIPHAN: So we can stop Jackson from leaving. JACKSON: Now... Can we go any faster? [engine reving] [brakes squealing] CRICKET: AHHHH [kiss] Dude, I can't believe you broke into elementary school. HOPE: I can't believe you changed your grades. DONIPHAN: Shhh! [door squeak] [drill whirling] [drill whirling] [chewing] DONIPHAN: Jackson help me. I've got it! HOPE: How does this work? JACKSON: We have to open the handle CRICKET: Woahhhh DONIPHAN: Hopefully like this. JACKSON: It's not there! [everyone groans] PIPPIN: Look! I'ts hanging around Monty's neck! HOPE: I bet he wears it there all the time! A necklace like that you don't take off. JACKSON: Or it's hidden at his house... PIPPIN: We've already broken into one place. DONIPHAN: Well... looks like we're going to Monty's house! DONIPHAN: The doors are locked. I don't see anyone in the windows. There are vehicles out front but I don't think anyone is here. DONIPHAN: Are you sure about this? DONIPHAN: Let's just get our stuff and stick to the plan. JACKSON: A doggie door? What if Cujo's in there? CRICKET: Or a doberman or something. DONIPHAN: Probably some little, yappy wiener dog. HOPE: Not with a dog door that big! DONIPHAN: Probably doesn't even have a dog. Maybe it's just for show? Alright little brother, you're up. You wanted to help. You're the only one who can fit through that door. CRICKET: Awesome. [silly music] [clacking] DONIPHAN: Let's start upstairs, work our way down. [quietly moving] [silently opening door] JACKSON: Uh, let's go... DONIPHAN: The key is hanging around his neck. Ow do we get it off... The fishing rod! JACKSON: no no no no, thats a bad idea. There's not even a hook! PIPPIN: There's absolutely no way this isn't going to wake him up. HOPE: What about this? JACKSON: A dog biscuit? HOPE: We can make a hook that won't stab him! DONIPHAN: What are you gonna do? Bite it? HOPE: What? no way! PIPPIN: are you serious... me? a dog bone? CRICKET: C'mon guys. Hmmm. Not bad. DONIPHAN: hmm. That might work. [engine running] [engine stopping] [yawns and farts] DONIPHAN: Okay. Here we go. [snoring] [snarls and mumbles] JACKSON: This isn't working! Let's go! Before he wakes up DONIPHAN: I got this. HOPE: Hold on. DONIPHAN: What are you doing?! [snarls] YES! [farts] JACKSON: How did you know that would work? HOPE: That's how I keep my dad from snoring when he's sleeping on the couch. [growls] JACKSON: It's Cujo! CRICKET: Qucik, he's on the bed! HOPE: He's got the bone DONIPHAN: He's got the string JACKSON: He's got the key! MONTGOMERY: HEY! what... who are these kids? Hey.

JACKSON: Hold on Cricket! [gasping and coughing] DONIPHAN: My hat! [coughing] PIPPIN: Come on Cricket! [coughing and gasping] BILLY: Blahh BILLY: Ugh! I'm going to throw up. [silly music] CLAY: [laughing] SAMUEL: What is this crap? CLAY: oh, That's exactly what it is. [squeaking] SAMUEL: Bat poop? ugh! BILLY: Those kids are gonna to pay. CLAY: They'd take you more seriously if you weren't covered in guano. DONIPHAN: It's okay guys. I got it! JACKSON: Really? so glad you found your hat. Good thing your brother didn't drown while you were searching for it! Let it go man. You are not Jesse James. DONIPHAN: I know! It's my dad's hat. It's all I have left. JACKSON: You don't get it! DONIPHAN: No you don't understand. JACKSON: You are not your dad! And you don't wanna be Jesse James. He killed and stole for slavery. He was a bank robber, not a super hero. Even his friends turned on him! HOPE: Jackson just stop! JACKSON: We are going after money that Jesse stole. DONIPHAN: It was bank money from Montgomery's family. JACKSON: It was the town's money. That Jesse killed for. That makes it blood money! PIPPIN: Doesn't even matter cause we're all gonna die if we don't move now HOPE: There's an opening here! Should we take it? PIPPIN: Maybe we should check the book? DONIPHAN: Here you figure it out. No no no! It's gone. JACKSON: You're my best friend, but you always do this, but come this Monday, if we even make it out of here alive, I won't be here to save your brother. I won't be here to help you with your report. I won't be here to finish the fort. You have to finish what you started this time. DONIPHAN: I lost the book. I almost killed my brother, and now we're lost in Montgomery's cave Was I a hinder-dance? PIPPIN: Wow. I did not realize I was signing up for some sappy, dramatic, deficating all over each other, depressing brotherly moment. JACKSON: Is deficating even a word? PIPPIN: Look. We've been shot at, we've been attacked by a dog, we've been chased at high speeds, we've drowned in a lake, I'm cold and wet, my hair is ruined, and not to mention if we don't get going soon, we're going to die! JACKSON: Well If I die I don't have to move on Monday. CRICKET: You look stupid in that hat anyway. Is that really why you wear it? DONIPHAN: Well... That hat is not dad Doniphan. Dad's in here. CRICKET: Are we gonna sit here or are we gonna do something? DONIPHAN: You're right little buddy. We've made it this far. Further than dad ever did. CRICKET: Dad would want us to go on. This is a great adventure. We're gonna stop Jackson from leaving. DONIPHAN: Well, we can swim toward the bad guys or follow this opening, and see where it goes. CRICKET: Hm, Okay. BILLY: I'm coming for you kids! DONIPHAN: This better go somewhere, fast! HOPE: It's up here guys! [shuffling] CRICKET: Have a nice day sir [sloshing] [wet cave sounds] DONIPHAN: C'mon, c'mon! They're on their way. [panting] HOPE: It's a dead end! JACKSON: What are we going to do now? CLAY: GET OFF! [splash] PIPPIN: We're gonna die. HOPE: There's no where to go. JACKSON: Oh! Come on! CRICKET: Nasty! PIPPIN: Oh gross! DONIPHAN: Pippin was that you?! PIPPIN: This is way beyond nervous! HOPE: What is that smell?! DONIPHAN: It's coming from over here. EVERYONE: OH!!! DONIPHAN: UGH! HOPE: What is that?! JACKSON: I think it's a dead body? CRICKET: There's more than one. HOPE: Looks like a... Miner? DONIPHAN: He hasn't been dead very long, He's not rotted like this guy. [somber music] Dad... HOPE: Doni, are you sure? DONIPHAN: I know this ring. I used to play with it while he shaved. I'd pretend to be him in the mirror. We found you... [from distance] CLAY: LIGHT! I need more light in here. JACKSON: Guys, quick, they're coming! Turn off your head lamps. CRICKET: Are we all going to die like you dad? [click] SAMUEL: Hey, it still works. The bat poop must have water-proofed it! BILLY: Hey, hey, you could probably sell that! SAMUEL: You think Montgomery would invest? Business Partner-wise? BILLY: yeah CLAY: No one is going to wipe crap across their phones, you idiots! Shut up! C'mon! LIGHT! BILLY: Jerk... [whispering] [mystical music] BILLY: Man, What died up in here? YOU know who died up in here. Well... some anyway. SAMUEL: This don't make any sense. Did we miss something back there? BILLY: No, there isn't anything to miss. SAMUEL: Well, they couldn't have just up and disappeared! BILLY: Well, that's just what Jesse James did. CLAY: Wet footprints. SAMUEL: They went through the wall? BILLY: No ya idiot! They just vanished? CLAY: Well lookie there. May just earn that bonus after all boys. [wind] [eerie music] CRICKET: Awwwwe Wicked! HOPE: How many are there? JACKSON: Who are they? [grunting] CLAY: Get up here! before we lose them. BILLY: Oh god that stinks. [grunting] [grunting] Guys... CLAY: Bring the light. BILLY: no! no. no SAMUEL: we're coming for you!!! BILLY: Hey guys! SAMUEL: You're gonna pay! [page flips] [gunshots] [loud bang] JESSE: AH! JESSE: Boys hold your fire! They only need one shot to know where we're at! HARRISON: I didn't think I was gonna die today. I only have enough rounds for maybe twelve more shots. ROBERT: What's next? JESSE: They're not man enough to come in here. They're gonna starve us out! HARISON: We ain't gonna starve. JESSE: Why ain't we gonna starve? HARRISON: Me and my brothers, we've been all through these caverns. There's water. We can swim out. ROBERT: From the rear! We can ambush them from behind! JESSE: what are you gonna choke 'em out? Guns don't swim. HARRISON: Wet powder means no fire. [eerie music] [gunshots] HARRISON: AHHH! [gunshot] [gunshots] [deep bassy sound] [eerie strings] [growling] SAMUEL: Did you put these here? CLAY: NO!? [growling] [screams] PIPPIN: What happened? JACKSON: I don't know. CRICKET: Maybe it's gonna bury us like those Indians? HOPE: Uh, Native Americans? JACKSON: Guys! It's Abraham Lincoln! PIPPIN: That's impossible! HOPE: No it's not. It's right there. JACKSON: It's like a small Mount Rushmore, CRICKET: only it's just him. DONIPHAN: Honest. Abe. Knows. Guys, Get it? It's a play on words! Honest Abe's nose! It was right under his nose all this time. HOPE: Does that one look like Papa Smurf? DONIPHAN: what? no. Look right there! It's a pile of... clothes?? JACKSON: That's gotta be it! Let's climb down there and get it! PIPPIN: Uh, can you CLIMB a rope? CRICKET: You can lower me down. HOPE: And I'll go with him. It's Okay. JESSE: They must really want their money back! You don't ever go through lock boxes! Frank knew not to go through lock boxes. I blame you for this! You gave them too much time to gather their men! CHARLIE: You got the loot! JESSEL What good's the loot do me if I can't spend it!? ROBERT: Ah! Quit cha belly achin'..You... JESSE: I blame you for this Robert Ford! This is your fault! It's your fault! ROBERT: It's my father's fault! JESSE: Don't you ever sass me boy! JACKSON: We have to go one at a time. DONIPHAN: I gotchu okay? Just keep looking at me. PIPPIN: They can't be far behind, we gotta hurry! JACKSON: Jesse and Robert stood right here. DONIPHAN: Jesse and Robert were trapped right here. HOPE: Jesse and Robert must have been naked here. Weird! Well I'll be... How on earth?! It looks just like him. Without the hat. ROBERT: Wondered if someone chiseled him out? Only honest Abe knows... Only honest Abe knows. [eerie noise] [growling] EVERYONE: C'mon we gotta go! We gotta get out of here! JESSE: We're Swimmin' outta here boys! Just like Harrison said, It's right there! JESSE: No coins! we hide the coins over there! Anything that weighs you down, leave it! We'll come back for it later. [deep bassy sound] DONIPHAN: they got out somehow because the pistol made it from here to the room with the wagon. JACKSON: A secret way out from here?! Looks like they stripped off everything that was heavy. They must have went underwater. HOPE: Which must lead to the lake, and the room with the wagon! JACKSON: It's a puddle, which is under our fort! PIPPIN: So that must be the way out! DONIPHAN: The same way out Jesse took to escape the posse! JACKSON: I saw that in the book. The top hat, that must be my boy Abe! DONIPHAN: An underwater passage... thats it! thats our way out! PIPPIN: I'm here for driving purposes, not diving, and my hair is so rashed already. HOPE: The treasure! It was under the clothes! Sacks of coins! More than we can carry! CRICKET: And there's old guns and quick draw holsters! [rattling] ...and a box?! DONIPHAN: The bank box? JACKSON: THE WILL! We're staying! [cheerful music] HOPE: Guys!! SAMUEL: This is my official two weeks notice CLAY: Whatever, can we just find these kids and get out of here? Which way? CLAY: Billy, I want you to go find Cobb... ...Billy? Billy? MONTGOMERY: Boo! HAHAHAHA I got you boys good! CLAY: Whats the matter with you? MONTGOMERY: You look live you've seen a ghost or something... MONTGOMERY: Hey, C'mon, my treasure is this way. Boy... you stink. DONIPHAN: You know, my phone really didn't like that first swim! JACKSON: My phone's waterproof. PIPPIN: Guys, Come on, we gotta go! Help me pull them up. JACKSON: ya know? we can't get the will wet, either. DONIPHAN: Cricket! You're a life-saver! CRICKET: Huh? DONIPHAN: Sandwiches Come on Cricket, we gotta go! Hey guys look at me! [ the kids struggling] HOPE: NO! DONIPHAN: Leave him alone! MONTGOMERY: Hahaha Tie 'em up with the extra rope, boys. Thanks for bringing me my treasure kids. CHARLIE: Jesse, I don't know how far we'll have to swim to get out of this. JESSE: I thought I told you guns don't swim? [dramatic music] DONIPHAN: This is nothing ya know. The real treasure's down there. MONTGOMERY: [laughing] you are a terrible liar. Just like your dad. SAMUEL: I can see a whole pile of stuff from here, boss. MONTGOMERY: Well get down there then! Listen here ford boy! That old will isn't gonna save your family land. CLAY: What's the problem? SAMUEL: There's no rope... CLAY: Well they got down there... CLAY: Yeah, with the rope! MONTGOMERY: My family's bank has owned that land for generations. Master Ford, he paid off the bank the same day he was killed by his son, Robert. Right after that, Robert went and robbed the bank! Of course the bank had to hold their land as collateral. JACKSON: That's deficant. PIPPIN: That's not a word. DONIPHAN: That's not legal. MONTGOMERY: And who was going to contest it? His son, the theif? His wife, the slave? No, you kids are going to come to a treacherous end here... accidentally, in these caverns. Just like Doniphans dad. Yeah, I killed him too. CLAY: Boss, uh, you might wanna come here. There really is more down here. MONTGOMERY: Okay I win Robert Ford... DONIPHAN: Go, quick! Into the water! MONTGOMERY: Lets go bury that boy with his dear old dead dad. HEY! Follow 'em. We'll drown 'em! [splashing] [deep breath] [deep breath] [splash] DONIPHAN: [gasp] [coins clanking] [intense music] NELL: Alda Everything's gonna be ok, ok? I love you ok? HARRIETTE: What about daddy? NELL: He'll get the fire... [panicking] [swish] NELL: NO! [women screaming] Handsome: [grunts] [wack] [crash] JESSE: NO! [crubling] ROBERT: AH! RUN. FORD RUN! AH! [panicking] [screaming] [crashing] NELL: [screaming] NELL: Grab it! NO! no! [screaming] No! NO! [crash] JESSE: I swear Robert... one of these days you're gonna be the death of me. [whimpering] [dramatic music] [main theme plays] [splashing] [music slows] HOPE: NO! [sinister music] [slap] [cough] [wack] [wack] JACKSON: Look out behind you! [thud] [thud] SAMUEL: [grunts] STONE: Everybody freeze! JACKSON: YES! DISPATCH: Deputy stone this is 1012, suspects detained. CRICKET: AWESOME DISPATCH: Backup on scene with Sheriff Angela. MONTGOMERY: Deputy Stone. So glad you could visit. [chuckles] STONE: Let's go see the sheriff DISPATCH: Officers at Columbia museum of history are requesting another unit to assist with burglary PIPPIN: ren't they supposed to arrest the bad guys? MONTGOMERY: Thank god you are here Sheriff Angela. These kids broke into my private property and stole my... MONTGOMERY [RECORDING]: you kids are going to come to a treacherous end here... accidentally, in these caverns. Just like Doniphans dad. Yeah, I killed him too. JACKSON: Waterproof, baby! DONIPHAN: We also have evidence that the Ford land has belonged to the Jackson's family for more than 100 years. HOPE: Neither Mr. South or his bank can force the Fords off their property or continue to charge them for a mortgage that never existed. In fact, Mr. South and his bank owes my family over 100 years worth of rent. ANGELA: These are some serious accusations kids. CRICKET: Not as serious as Montgomery trying to murder a bunch of kids, Ma'am. MONTGOMERY: What are you doing? We had a deal! ANGELA: If these kids have what I think they do, then I'm gonna get everything I wanted out of this relationship, You, behind bars. [cuffs click] DONIPHAN: Jackson, you're staying! EVERYONE: YAY! WOO! ANGELA: Got him! FEMALE DETECTIVE: Finally! Good work sherrif! ANGELA: Take care of this. MALE DETECTIVE 1: Take care of this... OFFICERS: anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law You have the right to an attorney if you can't afford one the court will appoint one for you. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? [slap] FEMALE DETECTIVE: Bonehead it's evidence! MALE DETECTIVE 2: Hey! It's blueberry. LISA: Boys! DONIPHAN & CRICKET: oh no... LISA: are you ok? DONIPHAN: Mom, we're fine. I Promise. HOPE: How did you guys even find us? ANGELA: Well, Doniphan's mom called in a missing persons this morning but then your grandpa used your cell phone's GPS to pinpoint your exact location then emailed us a map. STONE: And I discovered a small clue to validate your entire story. DONIPHAN: Grandpa? GRANDPA: Batman's Alfred. LISA: We're just really glad you guys are all OK. DONIPHAN: I know you entrusted me with the journal that's been in our family for generations, but in the adventure I lost it GRANDPA: It's okay son! DONIPHAN: What?! GRANDPA: Before I gave you the book, I scanned all the pages into a PDF file, and uploaded them into a password encrypted website on the Internet Tubes! MONTGOMERY: I would have gotten my treasure too if it wasn't for those puny little pieces of... [slam] [Tobi barking] BEN: Looks like you won't be moving. BEN: I'm being promoted to manager of the plant. REBECCA: He's taking Monty's old job. GRANDPA: Right where you belong. LISA: I can't believe you did it. I'm so proud. I'm proud of both of you GRANDPA: This is a heavy weight off the James name, boys. You've made us ALL proud. It's Gonna take a lot of legal action to get things back, but it's gonna happen. LISA: Maybe you can use a bit of that treasure to pay some of it off? YHOPE: eah? I'm sure there's plenty of it. DONIPHAN: More than plenty. [sounds of the familes playing games] DONIPHAN [REPORT]: Legends aren't always about heroes. I thought a hero was just what I saw in old movies, but it's much more than ust busting bad guys and adventures... It's caring about others more than yourself. A real hero doesn't just do things because that's the way it's awlays been done. They do what's right, despite the odds. And the real treasure in life are the people we care about HOPE: I like you're report DONIPHAN: and those who care about us. DONIPHAN: Thank you! JACKSON: For what? DONIPHAN: For the greatest adventure of my life! And also the Jackson Five. JACKSON: Dude that was like so last century... How about, the fantastic four. HOPE: No we should definitely go with flower power! PIPPIN: I think it should be Pippy Pals CRICKET: What about the Cricket Rangers! DONIPHAN: Or how about none of those, and we go with... The Goonies! BILLY: Guys... Guys! GUYS!!!!!!!
