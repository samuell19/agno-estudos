[Slow Persian music plays] [Car horn blows] [Bell ringing] [Car horn blows] [Motorcycle engine revs] [Birds chirping] [Siren wails] [Persian music plays] [Birds chirping] [Turntable whirring] [Turntable audio crackling] [Persian music plays] [Skillet sizzling, bowl clinking] [Singing in Persian] [Telephone buttons beeps] [Telephone button beeps] Did my face light up? Just a little? [Chuckles] [Dog collar clinks] [Plays piano] These are pictures of Ali and me when we took trips together in Iran... from the late '70s, in fact. Here's Ali setting on the Caspian Sea. Here's Ali sitting on the base of a dome, sort of a contemplative picture. This is Ali in the hotel where we stayed. I guess I call that kind of his Rhapsody in Blue. This is a picture of Ali and me sitting at the edge of a pool, and here's some ordinary Iranians at the time walking around behind us. Here is Ali at a picnic in Karaj, which is, in fact, where he lives these days. And then there's the one of him looking like the French movie star Alain Delon -- or so some people thought. He was over six feet, which was a little unusual back then for an Iranian. Everybody, when he was playing volleyball, which was the national competitive sport in school, waited for Ali's decisive slamming spike. He was a determined, dedicated athlete who liked to win. This might be one of my favorites. He was. It's a very animated face. And a -- and a face that I can still remember, and the pictures that I've gotten, the last three or four years, still look like that same face, even 40 years on. Loyalty. Unswerving loyalty. That's the thing that has kept us going from this distance and for so long. And I know from talking to him recently that he feels the same way. We've spent enough time apart. [Persian music plays] [Malachi] In 2010, my uncle decided to reunite with the love of his life. He and Ali met in 1967 while my uncle was serving with the Peace Corps in Iran. After keeping their relationship secret for 10 years, they were separate by the Revolution. But they managed to stay in touch by letters, phone calls, and e-mails. Although their situation carried a unique set of circumstances, my uncle agreed to let me document their story. And if all went according to plan, my uncle and Ali would finally be reunited for the first time in 35 years. [Persian music plays] [Woman] About 1,748 Peace Corps volunteers served in Iran between 1962 and 1976. And we have almost 250 of PCVs here this morning. [Alex] I was in the Peace Corps from '67 to '69 in Shiraz. And from '69 to '70 in Bagh-e Aurangabad in Horasan. I was majoring in international relations, so when I got in my second year, I decided to focus on Iran. All of us here that took the bold step of leaving home in the pursuit of peace and mutual understanding between nations. [Alex] Teaching English. My first memory is when the door of the plane opened on the airfield in Shiraz, the wave of heat and the smell of fruit rotting in the jubes, and I felt like it was wonderful and I was home. [Indistinct chatter] My Peace Corps training began in Portland. We all arrived here in mid-July of 1967. It was an absolutely idyllic kind of summer. It really was. For one thing, I knew that I was leaving the country, leaving the country during the Vietnam War. And I -- I knew I was going to a place that I would like. I knew that. I remember the Peace Corps guy who drove me to Shiraz and told me along the way that he wasn't sure that I would find the kind of intellectual stimulation that I may have been used to in Washington, graduate school and so on in Fasa. But I would certainly learn something about the human heart. And that -- that has stayed with me ever since he said it, because it turned out to be true, and it's been true ever since. Not since I left in '77. I was there altogether for nine years. But we ran into the Revolution, sort of. I met an Iranian guy. He's still a very close friend. And he's the person that I would -- I would most like to see, that I haven't seen since I left in '77. But what I discovered then... [Malachi] Of all the stories my uncle shared with me about his time in Iran, perhaps the ones that grabbed me the most were how his relationship with Ali began. My uncle wrote to me. One day, Ali and I were in their large family room. He was studying in the corner, sitting against the wall, and I was in a chair, reading a book. [Alex] The radio and record player were both going. His siblings were playing throughout the house, and his father and mother kept shouting back and forth about the progress of the dinner that she was busy preparing. I said to Ali, "It must be hard to study with all the noise." He laughed, and said he was used to it. I returned to reading, and a moment later, I glanced up to see Ali looking at me. He said, in clear English, which I had never heard from him, "I love you." I was stunned and didn't know what to say. [Malachi] A few days later, my uncle told me he was visiting Ali's family again, and decided to take a nap. As Iranians don't have the same concept of alone time that Americans have, Ali volunteered to accompany my uncle so he wouldn't be by himself. My uncle wrote... [Alex] So there we were, in the nap room, side by side, lying on our mattresses. And after a few moments of staring at the ceiling, we turned to each other, eyes open, and embraced. We started off as lovers... maybe more in a loverly sense than a physical sense. But it was... It was sort of instant and immediate and strong. And we never got tired of being together. At least once a week, I would go to his house for supper with his whole family. And we were kind of inseparable. One of the things that we always liked to do was go out and eat with friends and having a few beers or drinks. We liked to go out of town on short trips, overnight trips, weekend trips. We weren't that different. There was a little difference in age, but we weren't really that different in our world views, which sounds funny, you know, for him being a native of Tehran. We were -- we were connected. We were -- we were soul mates, I guess I would say, all along. And once I left Iran, I couldn't be sure of when I would see him again. [Malachi] When my uncle and Ali first met in the 1960s, the American-supported Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was continue to advance initiatives to modernize and Westernize Iran. While it was still dangerous to be homosexual and impossible for Alex and Ali to be open about their relationship, the people of Iran were welcoming of the many Americans like Alex who came there to travel or to teach. [Indistinct chatter] But the Shah's controversial programs, combined with heavy suppression of political dissent through the use of torture and executions fueled a backlash, and the onset of the Islamic revolution in the late-'70s. My uncle, as an American, was forced to leave Iran in 1977, or else risk his life. And he left his relationship with Ali behind. After the Revolution, it took 10 years for my uncle and Ali to be safely able to communicate again. They finally began to successfully write each other in 1987. And my uncle showed me the dozens of letters Ali sent him over the years. July 16, 1988. "Dear Alex, yesterday evening, your letter arrived, and last night till morning, I couldn't sleep. [Malachi and Ali] I read it over 10 times." [Ali] "All of this time, I'm remembering you, thinking of you. My understanding of life began with knowing you. I have learned from you how to be kind and hospitable, to help people, to love animals, and many other things in my heart." "Every night, I go to sleep with memories and thoughts of you, and I open my eyes with the same thoughts and memories. And at both times, I pray." "Every year when spring comes, I think of you more and more. Everywhere is green and the air smells of flowers, and I feel more and more alone. I am enclosing a few orange blossoms in this letter. Maybe they will revive for you memories of spring in Shiraz." [Malachi] For years, a hostile political climate kept them apart, with various conflicts making it impossible for Ali to leave Iran. [Reagan] We're not there to start a war. The irrationality of the Iranians... [Woman] Persian Gulf policies... [Ali] "The military forces of the U. S. are in the Persian Gulf and facing Iranians." [Woman] Television show the first for freedoms... [Ali] "I am so sorry that our two cultures have a distance between them. My sin as an easterner is loving you. Is love a sin?" [Malachi] To further complicate their situation, my uncle was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and his dependency on drug programs made it impossible for him to leave the U.S. [Ali] "Because of your HIV diagnosis, all I do is worry about what might have happened to you." [Malachi] Despite the numerous challenges, Ali continued efforts to figure out how to emigrate. But a series of family tragedies kept him tied to his home. Two of his brothers unexpectedly died of cancer, and he took the responsibility of raising their five children. [Ali] "Since my brothers died, I've been very tired and lonely. All my life is devoted to their families and taking care of their children." "Alex, I'm now 52 years old, and believe me, the only time I had a life was with you. All my life since has been struggle and unhappiness. How much I'd love for you to be here for just one day so I could tell you all the things I've been holding for 27 years. Perhaps in another time, in another place, we will be together again. Maybe I'll go there sooner than you, and be waiting for you. I love you. Ali." [Bag zips] [Alex] This one's called "Arazu Dedaar," which means in hopes of seeing again. Kind of appropriate, don't you think? [Turntable whirring, audio crackles] [Persian music plays] Everything else in my life has pretty much been concluded. I'm retired. I'm well enough off so I don't have to really worry about money. And there's nothing that would make my life feel more complete that having Ali with me again, as we haven't been since the '70s. Now that we're both old enough to know that there's not gonna be anybody else in either of our lives, I'm sure. Time we were together -- a couple. Something that would have been unthinkable almost anywhere 40 years ago... and is still impossible there. For all of its faults, there's no -- no place better for both of us than the United States. There's absolutely nothing to prevent his being my partner here. Nothing except a few legalities. Those... accidents of place of birth, which... are sure slow to disappear. But there -- there must be some kind of... of... law operating in the universe that would allow people who... who have remained this close and this connected to share a life, really, in the 21st century. So that's what -- that's what we're both hoping for. [Malachi] In early 2011, I began helping my uncle and Ali plan their reunion. But both having Ali apply for a tourist Visa or obtain a K1 Visa to marry a U.S. citizen were out of the question. Most states in the U.S. still banned gay marriage, and U.S. immigration laws discriminated against same-sex couples. In addition, Alex's home state of North Carolina would soon be deciding whether or not to ban all gay unions, both marriage and civil, by voting on Amendment One. So in order for Ali to permanently move the U.S., he would have to go through the process of obtaining refugee status as an oppressed minority. In addition to American laws, the other challenges we faced were many. First, because of intensive monitoring of phone calls and e-mails by the Iranian government, it was impossible for Alex and Ali to safely discuss specific details, such as the process of becoming a refugee, the dangers of being gay in Iran, or anything of a political nature. Second, with the oppressive government regime in Iran, it's challenging for anyone to leave the country, so we had to find a safe location that Ali could easily get to. As we researched locations, we found there were a few places where an Iranian could travel without a Visa. One of those was Turkey. We discovered that many LGBT refugees were escaping to Turkey, and the NGOs helping these individuals were experiencing greater and greater success obtaining refugee status for them in the Unite States and other countries. But the third, and perhaps greatest, challenge was the issue of Ali's own identity. [Man] The question was about sexual preference and women. [Applause] [Speaking in Persian] [Woman] In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country. [Laughter] We don't have that in our country. [Malachi] My uncle shared with me that Ali had never identified himself as gay. This was more than understandable. Even here in the U.S., countless friends of mine have faced bullying and physical violence, rejection by their families and faith communities, and other traumas during the process of coming out as gay. How much more difficult would it then be for Ali, who not only faced social retribution, but who had grown up witnessing public beatings and public executions of individuals accused of being gay? And because of the possibility of their phone calls being monitored or e-mails intercepted, Alex couldn't discuss the necessity of Ali identifying as gay in order for him to obtain refugee status. The hope was that Ali would be willing to do so once they were together again. After much discussion, Alex and Ali finally planned to meet in Istanbul for two weeks in May of 2012. Their reunion would be exploratory, allowing them to see each other, reconnect, and discuss the idea of a permanent reunion by Ali's moving to the U.S. But if Ali didn't want to emigrate or needed more time to decide, he could still return to Iran and take care of any unfinished business before making a final decision. [Telephone buttons beeping] Anything besides the... the movie? I need to write it down on my... [Chuckles] [Chuckles] [Laughs] He's working on getting his passport. He started studying English again -- oral English, in preparation for his move. So he's ready. It's given both of us a new outlook for the future. Not alone, not forever -- not like it might have been. [Birds chirping] Are you aware the Obama actually publicly came out against Amendment One? -Yes. -And -- and a president never does that. A president never interferes in state politics to that degree. No. Well, they saw lots of pictures of him. But we never had any reason to talk about him -- because they never saw him and never had any reason to hear about him, really. No. Not direct. I was eight years old when I realized I was gay. And when I was reading newspapers enough to know what happened to gay people -- that they were imprisoned if they were discovered. That it was illegal in the whole country, I think. And I didn't know probably exactly what was illegal, what would get you put into prison, but reading the papers, I realized that I would eventually end up in prison. So I lived the... the absolutely closeted quiet life that everybody back then did, almost everybody -- until I was well out of college, till I was about 22, probably. I mean, they knew it, certainly. But I think Dad might have -- might have even discussed it at some point, but we didn't. But Mother never quite got that comfortable. Here, Tash. Hey, babe. Good dog. Hi. This is Tashmu. Come on, Tash. Come on, babe. Come on. Good dog. I don't even want to look at her. I don't want her to see me. I will miss you. ** [Printer whirring] Well, I think I'm ready to fasten this. Oh, boy. No, this is... I don't need that. I need to try to find that other pair of reading glasses to take. [Keypad beeps] Is it beeping? No, it's not. Okay, now it's off. Battery. Motherfucker. All right. [Singing in Persian] [Pilot] Preparations are continuing. Please make sure your seat back is in the upright position and your tray tables folded securely. [Singing continues] [Exhales] Boy, that was good. He was... in the taxi still, like his sister-in-law said. -How did he sound? -Oh, excited and great. -Yeah? -Yeah, really. -Yeah. -Really. ** [Woman] There he is, yes? -[Exhales] -[Laughs] This is the fanciest book of Hiyam I've ever seen. These are... dry lemons to cook some Iranian dishes with. [Laughs] Persian traditional sweets. Mm-mmm. [Laughs] ** [Birds crying] [Indistinct conversation] ** ** [Malachi] We knew it was likely that Iranian customs would search Ali's belongings. So my uncle and I hadn't asked Ali to bring political or gay in nature. We were horrified when Ali revealed that he had brought political documents, including an application for asylum and writings criticizing the Iranian regime. And although we knew it was dangerous to be accused of being gay in Iran, we also knew that the government took potential political threats far more seriously. That night, I contacted one of the organizations I'd spoken with that helped LGBT Iranians resettle in safe countries, hoping they would shed light on the situation and provide the information and resources needed for Ali to make a decision. [Cellphone rings] Hi, Neil? Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me now? I'm gonna put you on speakerphone and have my uncle and Ali explain the situation directly. Well, I -- I mean, I -- I know -- I don't expect a perfect resolution to the situation right now or even a perfect answer, but I think that with your experience and I think it will help the decision-making process here right now. -Mm-hmm. [Malachi] So basically we just want to share what happened and then what the documents contained. [Neil] Okay. [Alex] Two days ago, when -- when Ali was leaving the Tehran airport, he had with him a small back containing letters from me, copies of letters that he had written me over the last 35 years, photographs of us together over the 10 years that I was in Iran, and an application for asylum that he hadn't filled in, but he had asked for it by mail, and they had sent it to him a while back. As he was going through the exit, Iranian customs, they asked him what was in the bag, he said it was personal items, including some photographs and letters, and that excited their interest. So they confiscated it all. And some of the things that they took contained pretty damaging evidence. One, for example, was a letter that he had written me giving his opinion of the current Iranian government, and even negatively comparing it to that of the Shah. So they took all these things. And gave him a receipt, and said they would see him in a month. -Mm-hmm. -So he's pretty frightened. [Ali] Yes. Yes. His older -- his next older brother, Ahmad, help me up in bed by sitting behind me while he fed me the soup by the spoonful 'cause I was so sick with flu, I couldn't even move. [Birds crying] [Vacuum cleaner humming] [Vacuum cleaner stops] Oh, damn. Jesus fucking Christ. He thinks that the people, especially the younger people, the educated people, will -- will bring about a -- a big change in... in the country in the... and a sort of tendency towards more freedom and democracy. And so I said, "Well, when are they gonna progress to the point where they don't stop people at the airport?" ** [Indistinct conversations] [Turnstyle chimes] [Turnstyle chimes] [Kid crying] [Malachi] Well, I was gonna ask... I find that his social views are, if anything, firmer than they used to be. And that's after 43 years of living in the Islamic Republic of Iran. He said I changed so much that if he had known how much I'd changed, he wouldn't have come. Wouldn't have come here. That he thinks my thinking has changed, my sensitivity has changed, and if he'd known that, no, he wouldn't have made the trip. ** [Birds chirping] [Water boiling] Karaj. Some more. [Crowd cheering] [Camera shutter clicks] -Oh -[Chuckles] I know. [Sniffles] [Sniffling] ** [Groans] [Singing in Persian] [Singing continues] Malachi, we went to the other restaurant with -- of the three up there by the towers. Last night. And I noticed there were far fewer people there. But, anyway, we had good -- it wasn't nearly as good as the one you ate... [Laughs] ** [Man] Okay. Have a look. -[Laughs] I throw it, it fly. Look, look. -Okay. Go ahead [Indistinct conversation] [Laughter] [Indistinct conversation] Of all the words that I should remember... Well, I tell you why. Huh? [Laughs] [Malachi] What did he say? -He said to you want to go there and get it circumcised? [Laughs] We were talking to some of his friends, and they were saying, like, you speak such good Persian. Why don't you become a Muslim? Well, you know, there's no connection, obviously. And I -- I said, "If he did, he'd have to get it circumcised." And there was a pause while they thought about that. Oh. -[Laughs] [Malachi] What do you think? Actually to bring to Iran. Uh-huh. [Cork pops] Heavenly sound. [Laughing] They were in civilian clothes, but they had a -- a court order. They took his laptop and some other records. They opened up a cabinet, took some things from it. [Persian music plays on radio] ** [Singing in Persian] [Ali] [Sniffling] ** [Birds chirping] [Thunder rumbling] [Indistinct chatter] ** There's no point in saying what I hope. I hope he doesn't get arrested and go to prison. I hope he doesn't get tortured. I hope he's allowed to return to his usual life. If it comes to it and he finds out that he can't stay in Iran for... for security reasons, he might have to reconsider. But, honestly, right now, I don't see how he can. Yes. I think he's totally withdrawn -- withdrawn into a shell of denial. God has the last word, if you hadn't noticed. [Singing in Persian] ** [Malachi] After arriving back in Tehran, Ali was apprehended by the Iranian National Security Police. He was then imprisoned, interrogated, and over the next few weeks, tortured. [Alex] [Speaking in Persian] [Speaking in Persian] [Man] It is disturbing. Everything that's happened has been horrible. [Man #2] Electrocuted every two seconds... [Man] He lies with his behavior. He was fucked! It was fucking heartbreaking. Listen. It's not just about Turkey when Irani... [Malachi] Over the next several months, I worked with a small team of people to provide Ali medical treatment and provide a safe path for him to exit Iran in case he wanted to escape the danger and persecution he now faced. As we had confirmed that Ali was under constant surveillance, we used an underground network to smuggle him a cell phone and set up a series of e-mail aliases so we could safely communicate whenever possible. [Cellphone beeps, dials] As he regained his health, Ali began to show interest in leaving Iran, to live with Alex here in the U.S. But in the end, after all he had been through, Ali was simply too broken and two afraid to take such a risk. By May of 2013, we'd all given up any hope of Ali making it out of Iran. And yet with each passing month, we watched yet another milestone happen for gay rights in the U.S. and other parts of the world. [Guthrie] Pete Williams, who has just reported that the Court has struck down the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. [Man] Any rationale for discriminating against same-sex marriages... This is not a sign that American's acceptance of gays and lesbians is becoming part of the new normal. [Malachi] But it was all too late for Alex and Ali. The long process had taken a toll on Alex, and he began to report more and more distress about his health. [Somber piano music plays] [Coughs] Tash. Tash, Tashmu. Man, her feet didn't used to slide like this. She doesn't have enough strength to keep them... keep her legs straight. Tashmu. Come on, sweetheart. come on. Every day is just another day of deep depression for me. When I went walking with my dog, I looked at the ground. I found the trip altogether, by the end of it, hugely disappointing at the least, and my feeling hasn't changed since then. We had moments, we had times when we were by ourselves, but we never had what I would call an affectionate moment in Turkey. Not one. They were all shades of disappointment, anger. His mind was already forward into some fearful, indefinite future. And the guilt for that was -- was what caused the depression. I felt so guilty for being involved in this whole failed plan, that I couldn't even face myself. ** I believe, to be honest, that we will... that we will never be reunited physically. I'm not sure that I would live that long for the political situation to change or... I don't know. It just -- it just doesn't seem quite possible anymore. We don't -- we don't... We don't talk in those terms anymore, in other words. I think we will remain close... by phone, but... in some ways, we've drifted apart since we -- since we left. And Ali was telling me, after he got out of prison, when he could still hardly talk, he said, "Well... this is -- this is the way things work, isn't it?" I'm sure he felt... some kind of... unfairness of the world, let's put it that way. And that, again, is something Iranians are used to. [Chuckles] The world is never fair. Fate is never fair. I would hope the people will understand that borders, differences of nationality and of culture and so on should not have anything to do with what human beings choose to do, where they chose to live, whom they chose to marry and love. There must come a time when the artificial borders of the world, the political world, disappear. But I'm -- I'm hoping that they see that long-time affection between men, between any people, can last. If the situation had been better... there could have been -- it's still nice to think there could have been a... a happy reunion and with a little bit of... of exertion on each other's side, we could have... lived together, probably in the U.S., maybe somewhere in Europe, I don't know. But it didn't happen. But that doesn't mean that people should not try for love, long-term love, distant love. ** [Singing in Persian]
