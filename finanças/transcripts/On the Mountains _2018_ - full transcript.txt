Dad.... could you stop, please? I need to pee. Patrik... are you kidding me? We've asked you. But I really need to go. No way! Are you crazy? You went just a moment ago. But I didn't need to pee then, okay? No, it's not okay. It was a minute ago. It wasn't a minute ago! Just stop, please. No, I won't. He needs to learn his lesson. Jesus! Don't you see I'll piss myself unless you stop? Calm down, Patrik. And you stop. Where? There's nowhere to stop. Move! Thank you. Leave your phone here. You'll survive a minute without it. Is he joking? Where's he going? What are you doing? Roll it down, please. Patrik! Where are you going? Don't tell me he's going to that forest. Christ! What is he doing there? We have time. Let him be. Let him be... He could have pissed here, couldn't he? Maybe he went to poo. He didn't say anything about pooping. He said he needs to pee. Maybe he was just ashamed to tell he needed to poo. He should have done that at home. Did you poo or what? Did you or didn't you? Well, yeah. Then why did you whine about peeing? Is this really necessary? Let's go. TO THE MOUNTAINS A week ago he decided to stop eating meat. You mean completely? Apparently, yes. And now they don't know what to cook, because the boy is picky. It's pretty common among teens these days. Lenka has also said her girls are doing the same. Really? If Patrik started it I would let him die of hunger. You would. I wouldn't give him any money. He'd change his mind within three days. It's also pretty expensive. That's the problem. Still on the highway? Yep. Okay. Stop at a gas station. I can't. Dad's driving. Tell him to stop. I can't. Should I send your creations to your Dad? Will we eat somewhere? If you are hungry, I could give you a bun. Do you want something? Maybe later. Okay. Let me know. You have ten minutes. We could stop at Soyuz, couldn't we? Are you serious? Why did I make all that food then? That's okay, we'll eat it at dinner. But we should stop, right? It's kind of a tradition. Stop if you want then. What do you say, Patrik? How far away is it? I don't know, maybe half an hour. There are buns if you are hungry. That's okay. We'll stop in half an hour. I want a photo like this. Got it? Can I take your order? Go ahead. I don't want anything. You have to eat something. I'll have roasted pork. Broth, I guess. One beef broth. What about you, Patrik? Roasted pork? Fried cheese. With french fries? You can have that anytime. I don't know. I don't care. Get something more interesting. It's on me anyway. Okay. Roasted pork. With coke. And two non-alcoholic beers. Where are you going? I need to call my friend. You can call him later. Sit down. How about speaking with us? But he's waiting for my call. I don't care. You're always on your phone. What exactly is so important? We just need to consult something. About what? Gaming keyboards. He's in the shop, but he doesn't know which one to buy. You have five minutes. They'll bring the food shortly. Thank you. Patrik? Patrik? Nice... make it more detailed. What a dick! Where were you? Put your phone here. It's okay, I handled it. I told you to put your phone here! What are you doing? Come on. Where were you for so long? So? I was making a phone call. Outside. Really? Where exactly? Stop it, please. Patrik! I don't know. Just outside. I didn't see you there. Thanks for the pleasant atmosphere. We could have eaten in the car. It would have been cheaper. Damn it! Patrik, are you ill? No. Then why won't you admit you were in the restroom? Will you talk to me? What's wrong? I don't feel well. Then why don't you just simply tell us? Did you throw up? I hope you're not into drugs. No, Jesus! I just don't feel well. Maybe it's the car or something. Then why didn't you tell us? You could've taken a pill. Want one? I'll give you one. What the hell, man! I almost crashed! You're really addicted to that phone. What is this? Who are you writing to? Give it to me! Stop it. What is this? How am I supposed to know if... What is it? I want to see you jerking off in the car. Now. Like on this photo. Give it to me! Sit down! Now! What kind of a pervert are you? It's saved in his contacts at 'Whatsapp'. It's just a friend joking, okay? What's your code? Roman, stop the car. What is it? Stop somewhere. I can't stop here. What is it? What is this?! Give it to me! Who is it? Show me. That's.... that's not me. What do you mean not you? Stop there! Come on, show me! Jesus Christ! No! Patrik! 8% of kids online are blackmailed. But only 2% of them tell their parents. Don't keep your problems to yourselves. Talk to us.
