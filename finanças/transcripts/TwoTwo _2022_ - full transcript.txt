Hey, man, uh, I know you left a couple of messages. - Sorry about the job situation. - It's tough here too. Hello, David, this is Trisha from the leasing office downstairs. We didn't receive the rent check last month. If we don't hear from you by the end of the day, - we'll shave to start paperwork for eviction. See, I told you he's home, he's looking at us right now. Tough night? What? From the looks of it, I'd say so. How long have I been here? All night. Second half of it. After the party. Mm. Of course, you could have slept in your... ...luxury doorman building bachelor pad, woke up there, and came here for a nap. Two types of gentleman like you could wake up in the trash. I wonder which one you are. The first, uh, party boy that overdid it. The second type, well dressed, so he can pass as normal, well-adjusted citizen in temporary distress, and then night comes, and he's back here with us. Shame of the city. Thank the Downtown Goddess of Skid Row. Shit, I lost my phone. What time is it? -You have to be somewhere? -No! Did you steal my phone? Answer me. I need the phone. Okay, come on, man, did you? I didn't steal your phone. In fact, I don't steal. Stealing is not good for you. I like to live clean. Well, of course for this, the physicality of things. Hard to keep that clean. But don't matter, does it? It's the inside that counts. Where are you off to? Won't you even say goodbye? Goodbye. What the fuck, man? You following me? I feel for you, man. You're new, I can tell. Takes a while to get used to it. Get used to what? Look, you may have been to college, and had a, a home, and a wife and a job and all. It's temporary. Nothing to be ashamed of. It can happen to anyone. Crazy times. Look, you're alive, and life goes on, you know, and things change. You read me wrong. You tell me I'm not right. Things are tough right now, aren't they? Yes. You hate your life, you hate your world, at least the latest version? Correct. You may even be hating yourself. But there's hope. Correct. You have a solution or anything? For the self-hate? Well, that will cost you one dollar. For what, your wisdom? Wisdom is free. No, the one dollar is for the "I hate myself" part. Uh, so you don't feel like a bad person all day, walking around with regret, because you know you did a good thing and helped someone. Very clever. But I don't have a dollar. Sorry, man. Someone who was good company and conversation in tough times? Sorry, man, no cash. -Not one small tiny little dollar? -No. How about $78.44? How did you come up with that exact number? One like me knows things. About my bank account? And other unexplainable mysterious things. To become who I am and know what I know, I've made the ultimate life-affirming sacrifice and gave it all up, to find it all, all over again. To know what I know, to see what I see, I've traveled through many worlds. Paid the price... ...to find what was waiting to be found. No need to cause a scene or hurt anyone. Let's try easy this time. I don't hurt people. Have you ever seen me? Last week. Unnecessary. And wasteful. You need to learn to conserve your energy. - You don't need to alter reality... ...every chance you get. The definition of grace. Look it up. Smallest number of actions needed to accomplish a task. Yes. Got it. Smallest number it is. Okay, so he's gonna go to go to the back now. And I'm gonna freeze the cameras. How's that? Nice. You can't bring anything in. I know, I know. No possessions or attachments since last Monday. I swear. Absolutely not. Grace! Well, this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't-- What are you saying? Are you saying this is my fault? Are you blaming me? No, no, I'm not blaming you. It's me. I just, I lose focus when I'm not alone. I get distracted. Okay. Well, is this okay? Because I need something from Marty's. Yeah. Fourteen, oh, nine... The winning lottery ticket. Oy, oy, oy... Victor, follow the rhythm of what you see. Be there with it. Git it, got it. Give me something else. Not kids, please. I don't do good with the kids. I'm sorry, man, that's all I got. I gave you nothing but easy ones, and this is the last one. This wasn't running for half a session, and you just totally sent him home? Don't worry about it, man. I can read him blindfolded. He's not going back in. - I have a problem. - Oh. This new screening system... ...you just came up with it last night? Revenge of the nerds? I mean, everybody else seems all right with it. Yeah? Well, everybody else is stupid. Oh. Okay. So you're now the gate keepers? -No. -Yes. What we're actually doing here isn't particularly your business. If you really want to know... Sure, I'd like to know. We receive a massive amount of data throughout the day. And we're trying to decipher it. So far we don't know what it means. But when we're not doing that, we're wasting our time with people like you. People who fucked up, got kicked out, and now they wanna go back in. You see, it's up to us to determine whether or not they should go back in. - I see. -Because it's not always a good idea - for them to go back in. - Great. Then determine me back in. Victor, listen, -I have some bad-- -Don't call me Victor. I'm 117. Actually, Victor, the bad news is, your number isn't being generated in the system anymore. So technically, 117 doesn't exist. You're back to being regular Victor now. Now, I don't know if this is permanent, or if things are gonna change, but by the way you're acting right now, it doesn't look promising to me. Let me in. No, we can't. It's actually not good for you. We've seen some bad situations. We used to be able to go in whenever we wanted. From the beginning. I don't know where to go. I have no memory of what or who I was before I got pulled in. I didn't choose to leave everything behind to pursue some sort of fucking enlightening career. This is something that happened to me. You can't just pluck people out of their lives and throw them back in with nothing. I need to get back in. I need to get recharged. First of all, I didn't pluck you or anybody else, so... ...Victor, it seems to me like you've lost that right. I mean, look back at what you had. You had this amazing gift. And what good did you do with it? Yeah. We heard all about it. Bragging all over. Bars, parties, how you could get girls. What was it, the Vegas magic trick? -All that money. You had some fun, dude. -I'll handle it. So what? I fucked up a little bit, right? But-- But it's not like I murdered anyone. Whatever, there is no rules that say that we actually have to save the fucking world. Isn't it that everyone's different? That-- That we all have a different calling? A calling? Like a calling for call girls? Shut up, you shit little sweaty computer mouse. What the fuck do you know? Siting there typing on your computer, looking at your TV monitors, drinking your chai latte pink tea like this is some fucking video game! Slow down. - No reason to get all worked up. - Vic-- - Victor. - Things are different now. More people means more responsibilities. Find your Zen first, and then you'll pass the test. And then, maybe your number - will start being generated again. This is so fucking unfair. This is a total fucking catch-22. I can't get any goddamn Zen when I'm back on the outside and I can't get back in because I'm not already some fucking Zen master? - Easy, easy. - No, no-- - No, no, no, I need to get in. -Hey, hey. - What are you doing? - No, no, stop. -Because I need to get back in. -Hey! Hey, hey! - No, I need to get in. - You've got to-- - It's dangerous. It is dangerous! - Stop! Chill out! Chill out! Chill out! Oh, oh, oh, shit. -Jesus Christ! -What was that? I'm trying to decide if I should feel bad for this guy. He really seems to want it. I'd rather put you in than him. Wait. Seriously? When? No. No. But you did say that one day, that-- And when that day comes, I will let you know. But until then, don't ask me about it. So what-- What's gonna happen to him now? I don't know, I'm not the one to decide. But if he lost his charging location, he's gonna have to return to some sort of normal life. And I find that's very hard for him to do, after being like this all those years. It's hard to reintegrate. I can only get 60 bucks since all I have is 78,44. We've already established we know how much you have. The machine only gives 20s. Try 80. -I've officially lost the fucking plot. -Hmm. - Craziest thing you've ever done. Ha! It actually worked. -Miracle. -And I'm $1.56 overdrawn. Proof of faith. You'll get your money's worth a hundred fold. - Just when you think things can't get any worse. As they say about hitting the bottom of the pool thing, I'm your bottom of the pool, and your push back up. No need for more wisdom, Joe, keep it for your podcast. I'm all yours. Brainwashed and empty and broke. I would like that. You know what sounds better though? Sunday brunch. A date with a cute guy and eggs Benedict and a Mimosa on the rooftop of the Miriam Hotel. I was at a party there once. Or I think I was. But I guess party days for us are over, aren't they? You can still go to any party you want, any time you want. But you'll be an outsider. You know, my memory is messed up. And I can't tell if I actually live through something, or if, I don't know, I imagined it. And that's what the experience is, like a false memory or something. Once you'll get the hang of it, trust me, it's an amazing experience. The thing is to learn how to direct it. Yeah, whatever you say, but it still doesn't make sense. You know, sometimes I still think that I'm too young for this, that maybe I didn't quite get to live life, and so it's kind of difficult for me to sit here and give up something that I feel like I never even got a taste for. You really miss these things? You know, the day before the charge days... ...I feel so uneasy. And then I get my charge, and then afterwards, it's, um, I don't miss anything. I'm like a whole new person Um, and there is this downtime, this gap, a day or two, and I-- And then I feel uneasy again. And then I look around at all the people, all the girls that are, like, my age and I just feel like maybe the normal life isn't necessarily that bad. I get it. It takes a while to get used to it. But you'll feel more even, -less ups and downs. -Hmm. I meant less downs actually. Many more ups. How many charges have you had so far? -Three? -Four. Yeah, I know. It gets easier, trust me. And you'll learn to hold your energy and not spend it so fast, and you'll stay charged longer and you won't be so starved by the next one. I think we are being followed. Oh, what are you talking about? Who? I know them. They lost their charge, they're trying to get ours. I don't think there is anyone. -Are you sure? -Don't turn so much. Shit, we have to run. No, not yet. We can't let them know we saw them. We'll keep the pace down until we pass Redford. And then we'll find a spot to hide. If we run, they run. Okay, why can't we just, I don't know, hide in here or something? I just really don't want to end up like-- Stop talking. Control your fear. You've got to control your fear. -We need to run. We need to run. -Shit. You should listen to me! Oh! No, please don't. - No! - Get the-- Yeah, I'm going after the other one. She, she's the most evolved. Do I know you? One-oh-three, what are you doing? - No more numbers for us, so you're gonna help us out. No, I cannot help you. I cannot help you. I cannot-- So. So. Here I go. Right door. Gotcha. And out the left door. You're afraid? See you on the other side. Remember, you can't ever tell anyone. Ever. Things go good and it feels right... ...don't question it, or you'll lose everything and be thrown right back out into your old world. Or another world much worse. I'm not sure. You're not sure. - Drive! Please, please drive! - It, it's red, -it's red! All right. -Go, go! Uh, okay. Um, just so you know, my insurance is expired. What's going on? Uh... Like, is someone trying to hurt you? They took my friend. I think she might be dead. Shit. Do you need to call the police? I, I don't have my phone. -Okay, what do we do? -Nothing. I think we lost them. Thank you. Yeah. I'm almost home, it's two more blocks. Are you sure you don't need me to take you somewhere? No. Well, great to meet you. And to have been of help. Uh... Take care of yourself. I'm gonna come up with you. Uh... Okay. Sorry about the mess. I'm moving out. I like this one. Did you take it? Yeah, there is actually a story. Uh, we were in college, and stayed up all night, then the camera fell, and, uh, we... ...might have drank way too much. So you just met a girl and brought her home. In record time. Yeah, it's a... ...weird way to meet someone. I'm not sure I'm making the exact same decisions I would have made a month ago. Oh. A little situation here. Oh, yeah. Uh, those, well, it, um... Mm. -Good thing you met me. -Yeah. What? You can sit down, you know. It's your home. Um... Do you want to know anything? About me, I mean? No. Yeah. Um, and you? Do you have a home? I have a few. W-- what do you mean a few? More than one. Right. I got that. But, um, like most people usually-- Uh, you don't-- It's-- Whatever. So who was following you? I can't talk about it. Of course. -It's nice here. -Yeah? Yeah. Your place has a particular quality. -Sad looser quality. -No. Do you want a drink? No. Are you hungry? No. But I'll take a shower. That would be nice. There's some shampoo and body wash on the floor. I'm gonna need something to wear. Yeah. Okay. I'm David, by the way. You need two towels? -Two? -Yes. -Twenty-two? -Yes. We go by numbers, but you can call me TwoTwo. Ah. -I think I'll stay here tonight. -Um... Yeah. Sure. Cool. Mm. Oh. What's happening? I don't know. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Is that supposed to mean something? Is it? What's all this? Where did you learn to do that? I couldn't sleep. So, you like books? Alias walked out of his apartment holding the key in his pocket. He closed the door behind him, but started to have second thoughts. He didn't want to leave her up there like that, but... He thought about going back up. But then he saw his friend Izmar across the street. It had been six days since he'd last seen him, and his hair was much longer, and he had a dog. How was this possible? Izmar had never ever mentioned wanting a dog. Don't be afraid, Julie, the machine was made to be there for you, not you for her. Count all the doors you have to enter and exit in a day. All the small decisions you have to make, and ask yourself, if you were to go back this morning, would you still have the peanut butter sandwich, or would you make oatmeal? The church was cold and quiet. It smelled like frankincense and myrrh. All the way in the front row, there was an old man. He was seated and you couldn't see his face, but June knew he was the one she had to ask. He was the one who knew everything. All that's in those books? I don't remember reading any of it. No, I just made it all up. How about this one? There was so much beauty in her, he wanted to stop time and be forever in the moment. All things considered, Kreuzberg was a good place to fall in love. I have to leave now. But I can come back. Do you want me to come back? Yes, I do. I want you to come back. It's the middle of the night and this is downtown. Where are you going this late? I'm gonna need a-- Can I borrow this jacket? Victor, why are you here? It's a, it's a-- I haven't seen you in a while. You've been hiding. Well, we're all hiding. But not from your own. -I'm one of you, TwoTwo. -Not anymore. You fucked up. Just leave, I don't want to hurt you. Listen, I just want to talk. Seriously, I, I have-- I can't help you in any way and I have nothing more to say. Right, you got a new boyfriend now, is that it? Regular guy-type, real fucking loser. Your hair is nice, but I don't know what the fuck this is. I saw you two earlier. He doesn't know what you are, what you do, or what you would-- Stop it, Victor. Just go home. Home? What home? Do you have a home? What do you want from me? I need you to help me, just this one last time. Look, I'm not getting locations anymore, okay? I'm not getting charged, and I keep checking those spots for these tickets but they just stopped coming. It's been over a month. Oh, my God, it's been a month? Some dudes are now the gate keepers and doing all sorts of tests and shit. You need to watch out, 'cause your hanging out with this new guy isn't exactly on the path of non-attachment. It will cloud your thinking. You will start getting weaker and end up like me. -No. -As you show and teach him things, you will start losing sight. That's what happened to me. No, no, it's not like you. I know what I'm doing. He's different. I can make him one of us. I met people too, and I got involved with them and I knew it wasn't right. -Uh... -Yeah. I need you to help me. Okay. Just this one time. Just this once. What are you doing? I need this. -What are you doing? -TwoTwo, I need this. -Victor, what-- -I need this. You'll get more, I know. For me, you're all I got. Don't hate me, TwoTwo, I promise I'll pay you back. Proof of faith. You'll get your money's worth - a hundredfold. - Yes! Joe, you crazy sun of a bitch! Yes! Oh, boy. Yeah! I'm back. What are you working on? Uh, nothing. Thanks for cleaning up the desk. It looks nice. I lost your clothes. You lost my clothes? Well, actually no. I just don't like carrying things. It's fine. You look well rested. I have to leave again soon. -Like, to work? -Something like that. Hmm. I didn't expect someone like you to have an actual job. What is it you do? Uh, where do you live? Can you give me at least some basics? Do you realize how absurd our friendship is? You're at my house, you spent the night, went through my drawers, uh, wear my clothes, and... Uh, I like having you here, I do, but I don't know anything at all. I have a job. I'm sort of a, how should I call this, babysitter. Really? You take care of small kids? Not small, but I take care of them, yeah. And where do you live? Uh, I already asked that, didn't I? Monday, I'm at the Hilton, Tuesday through Friday, I'm at Lucy's studio and then, on the weekends, I go back and forth between the Thompsons in the Hills who go to their weekend home in Palm Springs to Ginn Cha Lu who lives actually, like, two blocks from here. He has a little apartment that he rents out to some business partners once a month from China. I have a few other places that have a better view, just depends on what becomes available unexpectedly, like, my favorite is the Biscuit Building penthouse. Hmm, that's a little bit confusing. But the kids I take care of, they're all the same in some ways, they're great. There is five of them. I'll show you some if you want. Would you want to? One of my kids, she's an artist, really good. She's actually a lot better now that I-- Well, I don't want to take credit but she did get a lot better. She paints so fast now. I mean, she always runs out of canvases and acrylics. So I-- Well, you'll see. All done. Where should we go now? I don't know. Anywhere you want to go. Try to read my mind. -Just like that? -Try it. Um... Let's see. Um, something like... Ah, I got it! - This idiot can't even read minds. What the hell am I doing wasting my time with him? We need to go to this artist's house. See if you can feel where she lives. You don't know where she lives? You said that-- Of course I know. But this is for you. I'm trying to teach you. Sorry. I don't think I have the talent. I can't read minds. Well, fine, then get some guidance. Guidance? From where? From everywhere. It's all around you. Things, people, the air, sounds. The empty space isn't empty. They say that the whole universe, everything is alive You can reach out to it. It'll talk to you. All right. Left. No, right, right. Right? Very good. See, it did talk to you. Let's see what this girl is doing. I bet she's painting white over her old canvases - to make room for her new work. - -So what exactly happened there? It's called mail forwarding services. Or redelivery. So you saw the bird and put your thoughts in its head. You have a solution for every situation? Hmm, yeah, I kind of do, but every time is different. I don't know what will happen until it happens. It's like, I know what to do because it's the only thing to do, or what needs to be, it was already there, something like that. - Don't think about it too much, just trust it, go with it. - -Yeah, it's super easy, don't think about it. Listen, you are a natural, you demonstrated it. We have all day. He'll be back in the night. I have him leave the door unlocked when I come by. You have him? The authentic mid-century modern. Yeah. This is really modern. It's hard to find these days. People improve on the original design and they mess it up. But this one is well preserved. Oh, I love this lamp. I almost bought one last week. Uh... It was on sale at Kembrys for $39.99. No, no, you didn't, this is an original ABNER. It must be worth 20 grand. Hmm. Looks the same though. It's nice. I'm gonna get a bit of work done, make yourself comfortable. I need to help out Adam, he's a little stuck. My grandma always used to say, if you're buying something at the store and you cannot pronounce the ingredients, it's probably not good for you. I like to make my own mayonnaise. That way you can control the ingredients, and the quality. It's much more fun and rewarding and you end up with a superior product. It's like magic. Well, white magic, not black magic, because it will end up pretty white. But you'll need to know some secrets. Don't do it too quickly, or pour the oil in too quickly, or go in two directions at the same time. It will break. This is like magic. From chaos and separation and disharmony, to unity and beauty. No shortcuts. -Did you not hear the TV? -Oh! It's so good. Like, I love them all so much. Adam has real talent. I did help here and there with some opportunities. -What is this? -But... It's the language of music, it's like, uh, math. I'm fixing it. You're fixing it. But you don't listen. Uh, I can hear it in my head. Here, listen. So you guys know what this is? Are you gonna tell me how to read it? -Like-- -What the fuck is this? Two pages? -You're supposed to bring us a hard drive. -I'm working on it. I wanted to make sure you guys are legit first. Oh, don't worry about us, just bring me the fucking hard drive. Well, just be careful, okay? It's tricky getting that stuff out of there. If you get caught, I'm fucked. They're gonna know it's me. That's your problem, it's not mine. Hey, hey. Hey. I might be able to get you some more information, okay? I could stay on with you guys. You'd have someone on the inside. I don't even like it over there. Why don't we get this right first before we start talking about a promotion? Hey, the cash. You want the rest, quit fucking around and bring us the hard drive. Okay, fine, fine. I'll have it by the end of the week. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Why are you sad, David? I can't remember the last time I was sitting like this, just careless, in nature, by a pool. They have one on my roof. I went when I first moved, but then I never had the time. I'd wake up every day at 6:00, go to the gym 'cause everyone does, and then worked my ass off all those years for a promotion that never came. The economy crashed. And then I got a personal trainer and worked harder to not think about it. - I don't even know what I'm gonna do next. - Oh. Don't think about it right now. You'll miss what's right in front of your eyes. Isn't this just perfect? Yeah, too perfect. Makes someone almost think that happiness is possible. I was so miserable just a few days ago, then the weirdest thing happened. And, and I can't talk about it. Then don't talk about it. The truth is in the present. All else is just an illusion. The distorted impression on the mind. A second ago, a few seconds ago, it's, it's all a fantasy. Your inner truth knows continuity. It's weird, isn't it? To suddenly be so sure that... ...it was all a mistake? Work, college, the people I was hanging out with, all a façade, all that time wasted. Chasing a stupid lifestyle that I bought into. The right path. The safe path. I know the story. It's usually the parents. Yeah, when you're eight or ten or 15, and someone asks what you want to be when you grow up. You say, "I want to be a painter, a writer, a dancer." Then Mom or Dad goes, "Oh, hun, that's a hobby. Go to college first. And then you can spend your free time, whatever is left, pursuing your hobbies." So, I went to Harvard. What was it you wanted to be? A photographer. I've always felt that behind the lens, that was the one way I could see the world all around me and express it. I felt that I had a way. Yes. You need to change your mind right now, it changes the way you think about yourself. If you were a photographer, that would fulfill you. Yeah, I am gonna buy a camera. -I have to ask you something. -Yeah. But I need you to be 100% honest with me. Can you do that? Yes, absolutely. I'll tell you everything you wanna know about me. Did you ever pee in a pool? What? Did you ever pee in a pool? Um, yes. Oof. Never do that again, okay? I swear. -Ever? -Ever. Great, because it's not nice. Oh, shit. -Huh? -Shit, he's back. Is this 'cause I peed in the pool? Where is my dress? Victor was right. -When I hang out with you, I'm losing. -Who's Victor? Anyway, we got to go. There's one more thing we have to do tonight. - Did you get it? - Get in the car. Did he deliver? How did he do? No, as a matter of fact, he gave me two sheets of paper. -He claimed he had to verify if we're legit. -Ah, fuck that. Let me go. -I'll go talk to him. -No, let's just get out of here. -It doesn't matter. Just-- -No, no, no, no, no, I'll beat it out of him if I have to. Just calm the fuck down, Victor. This is not your problem, okay? At least he did better than you. -You didn't get us shit. -Better than me? Hey! I'm the one that got you the computer mouse guy. -Fucking pieces of-- Fucking two sheets of-- -Are you fucking, fucking guy? -Are you fucking-- -What the fuck! -This sort of shit. -What the fuck is this? These guys are everywhere. They're constantly watching us. -You're gonna just let him-- -Oh, my God! -Then go get him. -Go get him! Are you fucking kidding me? Get the keys. Give me the fucking keys. -Let's go. -You have the keys. - Fucking crazy. What the fuck! - Come on, -start the car. Let's get him. -Let's go. Let's get him. He's right there. - What the fuck, where? -Where'd he go? -You don't see him? -No, where'd he go? -Are you blind, man, -just go straight. -Go straight where? Hit the fucking road! Come on! - Ah, fuck that! All right, let's go fucking get him. -Fuck this. -Yes. Okay, now go up here. I think he turned left. He's up here someplace. - Where is he? - Oh, my God... Two weeks, three weeks? Probably three weeks. And I'll check on the shipment tomorrow. I gave her a pretty big dose, she should be up in the next few hours Wha-- What's the point? I mean, she's got no power, -she's got no ticket. -Hey, don't worry about it, I'll deal with it. - We should dump her. - We can't dump her. She's seen our faces, she knows the location. Dump her dead. I'll talk to Five. [metallic door clinks, rattles Be quiet. Look. We're decent. Wait, I heard something. Shh! Oh, my God. Where is she? I can feel it's somewhere nearby. What? It's fine, you can come down. Okay. - Wha-- When did you-- - Shh! Here I am, let's go. Imagine for a second that everything you see right now, it's all there is. I think it would be the other way around. Uh... Like, there is more to it than what you see? I want to show you something. Close your eyes. Look into the darkness and remember the ocean as you just saw it a second ago. Then you start seeing it again in your mind. Be with it. And with me. This will be our moment. Outside of time. You can take it with you in any world you go You can close your eyes and be right back here. Don't question anything. Am I dreaming? How, how can you make someone dream? How do you do this? - How come I'm flying? - David, don't speak, - don't think! - I want to open my eyes, - but they are open. - David, not now, - stay with me. - -There are numbers in the water. I took you too far but I'm gonna fix it. What's been happening to me since I met Joe and gave him my money? How did I end up in this world? -I need to know. -You gonna get us both killed. -I need to understand. -David, stop! -It's a trip. This is not real. But when? -David, not now. -It's some kind of fucked up good-bad trip. -Don't do this! It's not real. It's not real. -David, stop! -It's some kind of good It's not real. David! That's it. Yes. All right, I'm done. What's up, Boo? No, you know, I mean, I didn't have a great day, starting off my glasses broke. I don't wanna talk about it. But, you know, how I don't care about followers, of course, right? So I was looking today, just to, you know, see, how much more popular I got, and I started getting 10,000 more per day. And it gets better. You'll never guess who started following me. David. Yes! I know, I could, I was like, "Okay, what did I even do to having him start following me? No way!" And I went to his page, I'm like, "It's probably a fake one." No, it's not, it really is him. So look where I am now! Hey! You know where Venice and Hope is? Uh, yeah. You gotta take a right and then another right. -Well, thanks. -Uh-huh. Can I get you anything? Yes. Do you want to buy something? Yeah, yes. And what would that be? Uh, whatever. I, I want to buy something, but I don't know what. That's funny. Yeah, it is. How about you pick something for me? What kind of thing do you want? Whatever. You pick something and I'll pay for it. Okay, uh... I can make you a cappuccino. We have juices. Fresh bagels and muffins. There are-- Oh, lottery tickets. Uh, yeah, perfect. Yeah? Oh, okay, that's actually great, 'cause we've had them for, like, a month, we've only sold two, so... Which one do you want? You decide. Is this one okay? Five dollars? -Perfect. -Okay. Winner. New ticket. -Okay. -Good for you. How about this next one, I pick the ticket, and if it's a winner, we split the money, and I get to ask you on a date. -You get to ask me. -Yeah. You get to ask me. Yeah. Deal? You get to ask me and that's it. Yes, that's it. Okay, so... You get to ask me, doesn't mean I'm gonna say yes, but you get to ask me. Okay. Um... How about maybe you pick the ticket, and then you get to ask me on a date. Wha-- Wait, what? Yeah, and I might say yes, you know. And, well, if I do, then you absolutely have absolutely go on a date, 'cause you were that asked. You're the one that... Let's see. This one. No fucking way! Uh, sorry. No fucking way! That's just weird. You're rich. We have to split it. And go on that date. Something simple. No pressure. With money like this, we have to keep it simple. You might want to quit your job. What? Okay, how about... It's a Saturday, you wanna go? -Okay. -Okay. Okay. I'll, I'll see you there. Hey, Forty-nine? What? -Should I call you Forty-nine? -What? Yeah, you can call me whatever. Or, uh, David. It's good to meet you. What's your name? I'll tell you Saturday.
