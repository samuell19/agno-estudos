(A car pushes) World history is being written. The world's attention is focused on the man who's on his way in here, - - Dr. Ling Fu, China's Representative at the World Peace Conference in Geneva. At last it has succeeded, China agreed. All great powers gather around the table. The prospects for relaxation and lasting peace have not been greater than now. A few hours ago, pessimism reigned. 14.30 it was announced that dr. Ling Fu was on his way. At this moment, Ling Fu walks in the door. (Speaks Chinese) The People's Republic of China has always worked for peace. As a peace loving people, we have always wanted peace. But the capitalistic and imperialist aggressors- has so far prevented us in the efforts toward peace- - that are the only aim of our peace-loving People's Republic. We have fought against the tyranny of capital and revisionist traitors. And we continue the fight until there is nothing left but peace, and... - Was that all? - That... was all, sir. A roll of film. Bring it down and get it developed right away. It seems to be our job. The world is staring at glowing poles. And we have staff shortages. It's impossible to get good people. Is there anything I can do, sir? - That's just going to be something for Smmith. - He's insane, sir. Nonsense. He suffered a nervous breakdown after last mission and had to be admitted. He should be well soon. Have you heard anything about him? At least he's not in the closed ward anymore. (There is a scream) (There is a scream) (A phone rings) Yes, sir, Mr Smmith is considered completely healed. Excellent. Then you can discharge him right away. Thank you, Doctor. Ready to show pictures from the shoe, sir? Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next! Next. Let me see the next last again. Sharpen it. Aha. Next. - That was the last thing, sir. - Excellent. Turn on light. Now we have something to look for. Something's going on. The question is how... I have an idea. If we let the house surround and I stormed the apartment. Yes please. Then you will probably be killed. But if they have the Chinese he'll be found dead, we have World War II tomorrow. - We have to know what's going on, undetected. - Maybe I could sneak in? No no no no. Those people are not like that to joke with. And apparently they all know our agents. Damn, I've got another idea. If it was one they did not know. - Excellent. - Yeah right? One who assisted us mmod dr. Pax. He worked with Smmith. - His name is Frede Hansen. - Yes. - Yes, maybe. Can we get a hamm? - I'll fix that, sir. - Discreet. Nobody knows anything. - Of course, sir. Extremely discreet. That's just what we need. A top secret agent. - No. I have my job to take care of. - They're a representative? - Agent. - That's just what we need. They will be remunerated according to state regulations, where secret agents - paid in class 27 A without pension, but with small allowances and diets. - It's very good, but... - Your country needs Demm. A great responsibility rests on us. We face a cynical organization, - - which threatens world peace. Washington is concerned. - London is uneasy. Bonn is excited. - I'm not much for that either. In such a situation you will not fail. After all, they are not an ordinary man. - Uh... - We've worked together before. They have shown yourself as a man of proper casting. An enchanted nature. Brave. Cold. Determined. The lord of the situation. Superior. Fearless. Charming. Cynical. World man at his fingertips. Effective. Hard. Lightning fast. Tough and enduring. The one we need now that all the forces are deployed. Original, scrarabersalto. Next, Judo. - Ash! - Hand stroke. God, no, wow. God no, wow. God no, where is that written? No, now not all that. Knives, please. Knives. Thanks. There you go, Beretta. Thanks. May we see you with a Browning? Hi, Smmith! - Smmith! - Sorry, sir. May I just see? Yes. It otherwise looks excellent. But I do not know if we dare give you permission to kill back. From what I've just witnessed. I assure you, I'm fine. They must not take mmin killer license. Let go, then. But only temporarily. Give Smmith his killer license. Thank you very much, sir. The prerequisite is that you complete a task satisfactorily. - I personally keep an eye on you. - Thank you very much, sir. Contact them at the deposite. They must work together with Mr Hansen. - Is it strictly necessary? - Yes. We face the most cynical criminal organization of our time. And cannot afford to lose more of our own. Especially not you, Smmith. Excellent, sir. What do we know about the opponent? Not very much. Only that there are girls in the game all the time. Lots of girls. - Girls? Binoculars. Flashlight built into pencil. Camera in tie knot. And here we have our new pocket standard set. Three pills. The green gives seven hours of deep sleep. The red gives 17 mminutes of energy and intense muscle power. The yellow is instantly lethal. Remember it. They must only use as last resort. Lighter. Beware of it. Instead of fire, it gives a strong smoke development. The smoke is toxic. It's red so you do not forget it. Beautiful. Fine tailoring. They're sure it's bulletproof? - Good news. - I also have something for you. If you twist the heel half a turn... No! ... an explosive charge is triggered. in 6 seconds. They can use that hand grenade. Then we only need one vehicle. They must appear as booksellers. So this one should be appropriate. We have mounted an engine on 310 horses and six carburetors. It should provide a top speed of 270 km/h if required. We also have a few refinements here. Radio telephone to the headquarters here. When mman presses that button, a television screen is uncovered there. The screen and a corresponding one in the boss's office receive from the transmitter here. It's your sample collection, a work that is easy to sell. The copy has a camera and transmitter, which is placed in a suitable place. Here is the commander. - Ready? What time is it? - Almost midnight. It should be coming any minute. There we have him. Right on time. Ground to PX, come in. - PX to the ground. Approaching target. - Turn on the light. Ground to PX. The light is on. Over. Understood. I'm coming in. PX to ground. Parachute dropped. Everything clear. Over. Get the trunk and clean it up. Make it snappy. PX to ground. All is well? Over. All is well. PX to ground. Where are we landing now? Instructions? Over. - Is he over the sea now? - I think so. Yes, commander. PX to ground. What's wrong down there? Do you read me? Instructions, ple... (Flutes) - Mama, please. Do as I tell you. - You know I do not want to live here alone. I'll manage myself. I'll follow very soon. - I'll call as soon as I arrive. - Yes, mmom. Piccolo! Piccolo! Helo, What are you? Come on. Little! Come here. Come back. Then come up to grandma. Naughty, little treasure bass. How can I thank you? - That's good enough. Sweet doggie. - And you're a sweet young man. - Their grandma must be proud of you. - Mom, we'll be late for the plane. Hope to see you another time. Arrivederci. (There is a knock on the door) Come in. (Chinese sounds from the suitcase) (The doorbell rings) (The doorbell rings) Hello Hello. Frede Hansen. Sorry, I'm pushing myself. I come from... - Exscuse me? - Well, you're... - They speak English. - Who are you and what do you want? - Yes, you see, I'm an agent. - Agent? - Yes. presicely. May I come in? - What do they want? I want to show you some beautiful and interesting books. - I'm not interested. - Now. - Please leave me alone. - You just have to see. Just a little. If you do not like it, I'll do the same. - They do not have to pay anything. - I'm not interested in books. What are you interested in? Thank you. Oh, here is beautiful. - Pretty. Are you married? - No. Are you engaged? Do you have a boyfriend? - Does it concern you? - Yes. Exactly. - Because I have a book... - I'm not interested. Are you not interested in love? Yes, love? You are very beautiful. Alright then. This one will interest you. Here you can read everything so you know how. Every young girl should know that. Very interesting. Many pictures. Beautiful pictures. (There is a knock on the door) Excuse me. (There is a noise) - Now something's happening, sir. - Now look what he's done. That man is impossible. He's selling her the book. Thanks and goodbye. Nice to meet you. (Pushes) (Shouting in Italian) (The doorbell rings) (It rings again) - Hello, you. - What? Who? Me? How are you parking? May I just see your driver's license? (Impatient ring on the door) Why were you taking so long? Any calls? - Guests? - No. That means... - What? - A salesman came. - What did he look like? - Well, pretty... Pretty silly, you mean. Did you let hamm in? - I did not want to arouse suspicion. - So you did. And so? - Then I bought a book of hamm. - A book? Let me see. I'll finish bathing. Goodbye, goodbye and thank you for that. Sorry. - Yes, you're probably right. - The man is a foolish amateur. Now the opponents know him on top of that. Send him home again. (The radio telephone rings) Hello? Hi, Smmith! What? What? Fired? Why is that? It went damn well, didn't it? What? Order? What about my wage, and everything, if I may ask? Relax, Frede. They get what's up to you. Which? Yes, you just drive home in the carriage. Then I'll take care of the rest. End. - They're taking over the case. Alone. - Excellent, sir. I trust you. There is a lot at stake. - My killer license. - And world peace. Allegro. Allegro. Retired. Andante moderate. I do not find it. I do not find it. Sostenuto. Da capo. - Jesus Maria... - Allegro! Very lively! Forte fortissimo. - What about Luigi? - He... And you let the man go? Fool! Poor stupid. - You know the punishment. - Commander... - Wash the dishes. - Si. Si. And thanks. - What happened? - He escaped. The guy with the book. Have you read it? Is it necessary at all? - What would you like to know? - I do not know. Maybe I can help. I would like to. - Don't. - You do not have to read about it. - You've never tried, did you? - No. - But you would like to, right? - Mom would not like it. She's not here. Diana, you're so... (The phone is ringing) Hello? Damn, hello, mmamma. You've arrived safely? Well. I'm coming in the morning. Me? Nothing, mmamma. No, mmamma, I'm not naughty. Yes, mmamma. Goodbye, mmamma. Ciao. (Big and humming opera) We'm getting hold of the agent. I think I want hamm alive. Yes, alive. I know how much he knows. Get hold of Spinoza and Gonzales. - Carl, we can have Frede in the final. - Frede is safe enough. - Do you think so too? - No one can beat Frede. - Hold this one. - Remember, it's your round. Nooo. (It's knocking on the door) Coming. (Chinese sounds inside the box) (It knocks violently.) Just let him out. There is no need to leave him in the trunk. - ll commandante said... - Do as I say. Take him out and lock him in the lavatory. He can't get anywhere from there. What the hell is the meaning? I won't tolerate to be treated like this! I don 't have a shit to do with it. I got fired! Let go, damn it. That's a mistake. I've been fired, right? Fired. Bum-bum. Si, si. Bum, bum very soon. Hey, hello! Hello! In other words, honestly. Listen now. Please. (There is a knock on the door) Hello, Smmith! It was damn good you came. Did I not tell you to go home? To the side. I'm going to advance. - I cannot. - Go away! You slow me down in my work. - Listen here, Smmith, old boy. - I'm not your old boy! (A pistol shot) Dummy. Sul mare luccica l'astro argento Placida e l'onda prospero il vento Sul mare luccica l'astro argento Placida e l'onda prospero il vento Come to the agile Barchetta mia Santa Lucia Santa Lucia Come to the agile Barchetta mia Santa Lucia... (It knocks on the door) Xing-han huha. Tung kai tin ka poo xing xa. Tin tan tun. Taing pa xing xa. Fung tei kow tin? (It knocks on the door) Fung tei-o tin ka. Fung tin ka. Yang pingeling. Now that juices may be enough. I will not put up with it. - It's persecution. - It's utter illegal. It is illegal to harass an official working. Are you aware of what's at stake? My life! My killer license! I will not stand for more of this. So shut up, man! Now I say it for the last time. If you do not obey, I will not answer for the consequences. You're fired! I know that damn well. But what good is it if others do not know it? If they think I'm still trying something, it's dangerous. I demand protection. Excellent. It's the enemy's intent to interrogate you before you are liquidated. Hey, hey. I do not want to do this. I'm going home. Nonsense! We drive to the nearest town and take in each hotel. When you get caught again, swallow this radio transmitter. - Then I'll take care of the rest. - I have to go home. If you go home now, I'll abdicate all responsibility. As the days go by without news about Doctor Ling Fu, - - activity in the attempt to preserve world peace is intensified. The situation is critical. China's army is on alert. President Johnson has flown home. Albania rejects the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister of Namamba was arrested today by his son-in-law. At a rally, the former prime minister stated... One moment. - HR Manager, anything new from Smmith? - No, sir. I do not like it. Come on. We interrupt to announce that the UN Secretary-General has received a letter, - - in which Ling Fus abductors demand 100 millio dollars in ransom, - to be paid within 48 hours. You can not track the sender. It is still not known where the missing statesman is. Sul mare luccica L'astro argento... Come to the agile Barchetta mia Santa Lucia Santa Lucia Come to the agile Barchetta mia Santa Lucia Santa Lucia. Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome. The Executive Board has asked me - - to warmly welcome our foreign guests to Denmark. I will now for your entertainment sing a song from my hometown. O dolce Napoli O sol beato... (Hums quietly) No, no, no, no... He's coming very soon. Si. Si, signora. Excuse me. (Whine) Mom, please! I've told her not to touch anything. Momento. Momento, Soro. Si, signora. - What's going to happen to him? - Why do you care? He reminded me of a canary I once had. Come on, I'll show you. What's all this? It is the forgotten part of the German fortifications from the last war. We are below sea level. It should have been a submarine base. A fantastic construction. The Germans are brilliant. However, it was finished too late and has never been used before. We'll get your canary bird in the cage there. - What is it? - A one-man sub. Fine German engineering. But I changed it. So it works per remote control. The Italians are also quite ingenious. Tomorrow we will send the Chinese out to the North Sea. If our requirements are fulfilled, we will tell them where they can pick him up. - And if not? - Then he disappears per remote control. I like a lot of remote control. It's so clean. ...Oh... Is that all you have to say? Is not it cunning? Brilliant? I think... I think Mom's waiting. (Smummels and hums) No, no, no, no, no... (Whine) Mom! What have you done? Scusi. Scusi, Presto mio. - The kind of thing to me. - Sorry. - I've said you do not to touch. - I tried, it was just a little bit. Get hold of Leonardo and Benjammino. I can make you a nice cup of cioccolato. - Mom. - Bambino. (A cat mumbles loudly) (The cat continues to meow) The holy book... (Several cats meow loudly) Oops, oops, oops. What the hell? (A radio receiver beeps) (The radio receiver beeps) Heck of an accident. Thanks. Thank you. (The radio receiver beeps) (The receiver beeps more intensely) In favor... Momento. - Thank you. - Prego. (The radio receiver beeps loudly) Presto, what are you doing? Nothing, mmamma. Si, si, commandante. Si, si. Capito. (The radio receiver beeps) Sorry, uh... I guess they could not tell me where... No! I just needed to borrow... Excellent. Come with him. (There are shots) Mom, please. (The radio receiver beeps) (It beeps louder) And well. Sit down. You answer my questions or you get killed. Is that clear? - Who are you and what do you want? - I'm not... Do not tell what you are not, but what you are. Make it snappy. I'm just... (A dog barks.) Piccolo. Piccolo. Little! Come here, subito! See who we have here! Piccolo's very best friend. How sweet of you to come visit us. - Mom, that's it. We're talking business. - Yes? Then you should have a nice cup of cioccolato. Hello? Hello, Dad, it's Orla. We have arrived. Here is nice. It was good you recommended Hotel West. - It's cozy here. - And the family is fine? Both Little Per, Sos and the twins. But we have not seen Uncle Anders. Well. You do not think it's serious with Uncle Anders? No. I definitely think he's quick for the party this morning. Goodbye, Dad. Mmmmmmmmm. Sweet. Soon we will go to Naples - - and finds a sweet Italian girl Presto can marry. Say, say, you do, as mum says, and get a lot of little bambini. How nice. You must come and visit us. Naples is so beautiful. - Well, look at Naples and die. - How long are you staying with us? I do not know. Shouldn't our friend have the pink room? - The pink room? - Si. - Do you think so? - Si, mama. Really? Can I? Si, mama. You may. - Scusi. - Alright. Momento. (Humming) (The phone is ringing) Pronto. Yes? Excuse me? Uncle Anders? Si, si, commandante. Very curious. Find out who he is. Put the intelligence on the job. (The sound of a whistle) (There is a knock on the door) Come in. (And there goes up) - Good day. - Good day. I wanted to see if you're in comfortable. Are you? - Do you think about the room? - Yes it is... It's pink. Do you like chammpagne? An excellent chammpagne. It is pink. - Nice. - We like our costumers to feel at home. (There is a knock on the door) Come in. - Are you really an agent? - Of course. - They do not look like one. - No? - More chammpagne? - Yes. Nice. Are you... Thank you. - Are you really a bad girl? - Bad? Why? You do not look like one. I guess I do not. That's what's the problem. I'm coming from a good family. My father is a handsome man and my grandmother is a beautiful woman. Even my big brother is a pretty boy. We live in a good neighborhood and have a lot of nice friends. One day I could not stand it anymore. I did not want to be good. I want to be bad. - Bad. - I can understand that. Can you? Can you really? Take a little more chammpagne. It's not easy. Thanks. I was trying desperately to root myself into something bad. But it was a big disappointment. It never made me feel bad. Now I do not know what to do. There's only one thing left I haven't tried. (There is a knock on the door) Making love. It's bad. Isn't it? I was told that was the worst thing I could do. Do you want more chammpagne? I would like to. - The book, You sold me... - Interesting, right? Yes, but I would like to ask a few things if you don't mind? It seems that lovemaking is not just one thing. It's a little confusing with all these possibilities. Try to see here. See now here, for example. Do you know it? - Oh yes. - How was it? That's great. Well. What about this one? Is it bad? Well... It's not that bad. More chammpagne? Help yourself. - You are very pretty. - Thanks. - What's wrong with it? - It is new. And complicated, right? It must be exhausting. The question is, which one is really bad. What do you think? I think you're wonderful. - Which one would you recommend? - I think... - It must be bad. - Clearly. I would be deeply grateful if you would give me some good advice. It's terribly important... Huuii... Do that again. I feel bad. I feel bad. I'm feeling wonderfully naughty. How do you feel? - It's not that bad. - Let's try again. That's how we should always have it. Let's run away together. Far away. - Anywhere. - Somewhere over the rainbow... We better do it right away. I think they want to kill you. Do not kill me, l'm so children... What? (There is a knock on the door) No, no, no, no, no, no. Sir? No no no no... Comm. Quickly. Come on! No no. Later. Sir, you can not say that kind of thing. I have always put service everywhere! I do not touch tobacco, liquir or women. Only for business. You know that very well. Yes, yes, yes. We still trust Demm. But I'm not convinced we're letting Demm keep that killer license. Sir, I assure you... It all depends on how you handle that case. There are only a few hours left. There's a lot at stake, Smmith. - Okay, what about the man? - Kill him. (There is a faint snoring) And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big numbers of the show are coming. An enchanting, refreshing water pantomime - - Listed by the world-famous '' Little Mermmaids of Venice ''. - Si, si, commandante. Fantastic. - Are you sure? Them all 12? Yes, commander. Madonna mia. What a man. I beg you... Music! (Humming) Mom, please! Ouuch, my ass! (The sound of steps approaching) Thank you, mmamma. A strike. Mama mia... Mom! (The sound of a falling gate) Ahh... Xing han hu ha. - Hi, Smmith. - No. Now that may be enough. No, wait a minute! Take it easy. I know where the Chinese are. Alright girls, the party's over. (Speaks Chinese) Xing han hu ha. (Speaks Chinese) (Violent shouting in Chinese) Ohhh... Wow. Fine work, Smmith. First class. Both Washington and Moscow offer to award you major orders. Unfortunately, the regulations do not allow you to receive orders. But it's a pleasure to present you with this. Congratulations. Thank you very much, sir. Subtitles Essery.
