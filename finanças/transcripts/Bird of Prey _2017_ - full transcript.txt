At the nest size, they build from three to five hides. The first one is about two-hundred yards away. The final hide is about twenty-five yards away and slightly above the nest so as to be able to see into it.

I want to give him a chance to see eagles in the wild as well because I did have a chance before to see eagles in the wild and I want him to have the same chance. [Jayson] You still have other eagles that you can spare from this experience. So, how do we do that? We need to move forward. ♪ [Pedro] Awareness is pasat this stage. We have to move on to attitude. Yeah? If you want an A for awareness, I'm looking an A for attitude. I want a change in attitude. That's something that sticks. And that's something you feel in your guts. ♪ [Neil] What I do when I'm up here is I just stare at this viewfinder. And that's all I do. To put all your energy into it, all of your senses have to be riveted. I'll go back to a higher frame rate in case we get another angle. ♪ The eagles are kind of getting panicky again. [Bob] As important as this is, and as dedicated as Neil has been, I have a level of pessimism that until some major sociological changes take place, that we're all just delaying the eventual. [Neil] Some people question the sanity of actually trying anything when they just kind of throw the towel in and they hold their hands up and they say, "What can we do? What can you do?" The population is going to continue, the forest will all be cut down and the eagle would be extinct. ♪ No, let's not just give up. Let's not say it's impossible. Let's not give up hope for the Philippine eagle and other endangered species around the world, including elephants, rhinos. ♪ [BoThere was no obstacle that was too tall to get over. We found a way to get around it. There was no "no". We didn't say, "No, we can't do that." You know, "We'll never find a nest," you know, "The eagle had died. We'll never find another nest." These are words that Neil would never say. But he followed through with it regardless of the odds. [NeiFor me, these creatures are masterpieces of nature. Some people say masterpieces of God. Some people correlate it to religion. I personally cannot stand the thought of these masterpieces becoming extinct. And so, there's a handful of people that want to do something about it and I'm one of them. ♪ [Dennis] There are no hopeless cases, only people losing hope. And I don't want to be that person losing hope. And I can see that my colleagues share the same thing. [Jayson] It's this faith that we have that this bird has a chance to survive in the wild. We know that other people might not share our values. But there's also a big possibility that such values can be shared by other people. [Bob] You have to have a dogged determination that where other people find excuses not to do things, you find a way to make it happen. [whistles] Look at that. [Jayson] Philippine eagle conservation work is not just about biology, it's not about ecology, it's not just about research. It's basically working with the diversity of human tendencies, of human behavior. This is partly economic, it's partly political, it's partly scientific rolled into one. Things are connected. ♪ [Neil] I'm hopeful that we will make a difference because I think we made a difference thirty-six years ago. ♪ The work we did has bought the eagle time, time by influencing people, even President Marcos. [Bob] The eagle was described as Pithecophaga jefferyi. Pithecus meaning monkey and phaga meaning eater or destroyer. [Bob] So, from the beginning of time, this bird was known even to the local people as a bird that eats monkeys. Well, you go in and talk to people about the monkey-eating eagle and how important it is and they take up sides with the monkeys. [Bob] So, it was very important that we get rid of that name. When we went in to see Marcos, we said this is a bird that does eat monkeys but rarely and we think that it's getting a bad rep by being called the monkey-eating eagle. "Well, if it's only found in the Philippines, why don't we call it the Philippine eagle?" [laughing] Bingo, you know. [Bob] So, he passed a special presidential proclamation changing the name from monkey-eating eagle to Philippine eagle. Probably, the only name of a bird in the history of ornithology that's been changed by a president. Uh! [LaurOkay, adult just landed at the nest, everybody. Over. I just saw that. If I can be quick, we might have a chance. Over. [LaurOkay. I think it might be good for you to not climb yet. Over. [Neil] I got to get this camera built, and actually hope that I do it in time to get him leaving for a possible flying shot. There's really a good chance that we'll get something from this platform. You got to think clearly so you don't, you know, drop anything. It's actually kind of exciting. [Laura] The second one is coming behind it. Over. [Neil] I don't like to put human emotion into animals, but I can tell you what, it seemed to me like they were just enjoying that day in pair bonding, celebrating the fact that they've got a young eagle that's healthy and robust. And the first time I've ever seen anything like that. [raining] [thunders roaring] [rain intensifies] ♪ ♪ [bird chirping] [birds crying] ♪ ♪ ♪ [Neil] Yeah, that's great to get these details. See, these feathers are pretty much fully grown now. You know, the secondaries are still growing and the primaries in the tail. [Neil] Little piece of down on the end of his beak there. He's slowly but surely losing all that-- I try to pay a lot of attention to the feathers and the preening and that kind of stuff. Since that's kind of crucial right now is like getting his feathers ready for flight. [NeiSo, you notice that when the wind kicks up just the right way, he really gets into it. [Skip] You can tell they take great pleasure [Neil] That has got to be one of the most amazing beak cleaning shots of any raptor ever done. -[Skip laughs] -[Neil] Seriously. That is so nice. Oh. ♪ ♪ [Bob] It'll be a legacy that will live on forever. ♪ [Bob] I think that the vision to go back to compare what we did in the past to what we could do today and to go beyond that is very important. ♪ [Lory] The eagle must be accessible. People must be able to have an opportunity to see why this bird is our national symbol. When you see that bird, there are few wildlife experiences that compare. ♪ [eaglet crying] [eaglet crying] [Jayson] We believe that he belongs to the wild.

It might be found here but it's a property of the world. ♪ [PedrWe want it to be free across the Philippines. And that's a struggle because it takes more than belief, it takes doing, and this is the time for doing. We know all the right things to say, we have all the policies, but we have to live by it. That's the challenge. ♪ ♪ [PedrYou just watch a child see an eagle unfold its wings for the first time and you re-live your own childhood. Yes, you can dismiss it as silly. Rationally it has no value, economically it has no value. But what it has to the human spirit is immeasurable. [birds chirping] ♪ [Neil] Hey, girl. Good girl.

I think the eagle is a very visible and powerful symbol of everything that is at risk. ♪ ♪ [Pedro] I think all of us have to realize that saving the Philippine eagle and saving Philippine forests really goes way beyond what meets the eye.
