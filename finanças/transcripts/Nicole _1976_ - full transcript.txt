This is our custom executive special-- full power, full air, full everything. You're economic? Got this little Oldsmobile Cutlass seven-passenger beauty. Great for suburban driving and running around town. So, folks, as you can see, come see Fletcher the dollar stretcher here. We've got the finest cars in town. Let's work out a deal. You come see me now. Won't you? Malcolm! Do you see him? See who? The guy on the-- on the, uh-- on the commercial? You have the wrong-- I wasn't watching, I was reading the paper. Oh, dammit, you have the wrong channel on. What about it? That's it, that the one. Well, what was it? Oh, I thought I would catch it. What about it? What? Tell me, how long is it between commercials? Five, maybe 10 minutes? OK, I'll tell you one thing-- promise me to keep this on. Stay on this channel. I'll be right back. Well, wh-- wh-- what, to watch the commercial?

What, do I scare you? Get off me! [laughing] Stop the car! --[yelling] Oh, look at this little darling! Stop this car! [laughter] Here, go on! Bye! [laughter] Dumb broad! SPEAKER (ON TV): Well, hello! Fletcher, your friendly dollar-stretcher here, where money talks, and nobody walks. Come on down. Let me show you something in a car today. How about this beautiful Oldsmobile Cutlass? What about Cruiser? What about finer little models? Or this '71 demonstrator model? Never registered, very low mileage, the only used car on the lot. Good little vehicle. Malcolm? Yeah, in here. Here. What's that for? I want them developed. What, tonight? No, not tonight. First thing in the morning. Oh, all right. So did you watch the program? And you took down the name, the address, and the name of the guy? No, I didn't. You didn't? Nope. Why did you-- why not? Why did you-- You didn't tell me to do that. You just told me to watch the program, that was all. I did, I told you-- No, you didn't. You told me to watch the program, and you walked out. Oh, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Well. Well, I'll tell you what I want you to do. I want you to watch the program until the commercial comes up again, and you take down the name of the pace, the address, and the name of the guy. And I want these developed first thing in the morning. Changed your mind again? Don't want to go to the horse races? Yes, I've changed my mind again. This is far more important. Now, remember-- first thing in the morning. OK. [screaming] Malcolm, no! No! Malcolm-- oh, my god, you scared me. Oh, my god, you scared me! I'm sorry. I just brought these. I just brought these to be developed. All right, I'll just put them there. You can just develop them in the morning. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that. That's all right. You can go to sleep now. Don't worry, I won't come back. Good night. Nicole! Malcolm? Here they are. Oh, you've got the pictures. Oh, god-- oh, terrific, oh, wonderful. Oh, my god, they're so good. Oh, they're great. Fantastic. Did you get the address? Yes, I got the address. Gimme, gimme, gimme. OK. Yes, ma'am, can I help you? Yes, you have a salesman called Fletcher. Fletcher? Just a minute, I'll get him for you. Hey, Fletch, little lady out here to see you. Listen, I got to run along right now. OK? Talk to you a little later. Yeah, bye-bye. She's around the corner, right there. Where is she? Right over there. Thanks. Oh. Can I help you, ma'am? -Hello. -Hello. Fletcher. Yeah. How'd you get my name? Um, a friend. Did I, uh, sell a car to a friend of yours? Yes, that's right, yes. Wonder who that could've been? Mrs. Williamson. That's it, Mrs. Williamson. How is she? Oh, she's very well, and very happy with her car. Give her my regards, will you? I will. Oh, good, good. What can I do for you? Well I, uh, would love to buy a Chrysler. We sell Oldsmobiles here, dear, it's a better car. Oh, well, Oldsmobile would be fine. Can I show you around? Yes, show me what you have. Well, come this way, please. Now, this is our finest model. It's the luxury custom cruiser wagon. It's fully equipped, fully air conditioned, some of the finest leather upholstery, as you noticed. And we've got wall-to-wall carpeting. Even the doors are carpeted. Why don't you have a seat in there. I'd like to show you a nice feature on this. It's got a-- just sit there, if you will, move your legs in. Six-way power seat, which can go up, down, sideways and forward, as you can see. It's fully carpeted wall to wall. Some of the finest plush, heirloom carpeting. It's a nine-passenger. Tell me, do you have any children? No. Well, maybe it's a little practical for you. Let me show you something in a Cadillac. All right. There's a fine car. It's one of our finest models. It's the Fleetwood Brown. Just get a feel of that upholstery in there. This is some of the finest upholstery. Soft as rubber. Tell me, how do those seats feel to you? Wonderful. You feel all right? Yes. Why? I don't know. Somehow I just feel you're not interested in buying a car. You really want to buy a car? No, not really. So what-- what are you doing here, then? Mm, I don't know. Well, maybe we can go out, have a drink, or something. Well, right now it's not such a good time. I could have your phone number then, and, uh, I'll call you. I tell you what-- you give me your phone number. I don't have those phones. No? I don't believe in them. Very original. Why don't you give me your address, then? All right. 5046 Argyle, apartment 202. Thank you. Uh-- [choral music] NICOLE (VOICE ON MACHINE): Hello, this is a recording, Margaret Duvall speaking. In my absence, if you want to leave your name and message, please speak when you hear the tone. Thank you. [beep] SPEAKER (ON MACHINE): Hello? Ms. Duvall? This USA Cleaners. Your laundry is ready, you can pick it up at any time. [beep] SPEAKER (ON MACHINE): Hello, Mrs. Duvall? This is [inaudible] Produce. We sent many boys over there for your water, but you weren't home. Should we wait for you to come here? Or do you want us to be there at a specified time? Thank you. [beep] SPEAKER (ON MACHINE): Hello, Ms. Duvall, this is USA Laundry. Uh, your laundry's still here. What do you want us to do? Mail it in, or will you come and pick it up? [beep] SPEAKER (ON MACHINE): Uh, Ms. Duvall? It's the gas station calling again. I called regarding your automobile. Just talked to [inaudible] a couple weeks ago. And so far I didn't hear any answer for you. I just wonder what's going to be, you know. Because, uh, I got kind of half of it over there. I don't know what to do. And besides, my garage is kind of small, and I can't share with automobiles, so please give me some advice what you want to do. Because I would like to finish the job. [knocking] Who is it? Me. Me, who? You know, me. What apart-- who are you looking for? Fletcher-- come on, open the door. Oh, it's you. May I come in? Well, yeah, of course. So you know who I am? Of course I know who you are. Who am I? You're the lady from the car-- the car lot. Yes, what else? What do you mean, what else? Never mind. Say, this is a strange place you live in. What's, uh, so strange about it? Mm, the lobby, all this, everything. Oh. [coughs] Whose apartment is this? It's my apartment. Why? Well, I just didn't figure out a bachelor's apartment to look like this. What did you figure a bachelor's apartment to look like? Mmm-- more modern, cleaner, Playboy magazine, you know. I'm not that type of bachelor. No? What kind of a bachelor are you? I haven't figured it out yet. Strange kind of man. Well, I don't know what you mean by that. What kind of family did you come from? Italian, I guess. Hmm. Excuse me, I'll just clean this up a little bit. Huh, where's your mother? She's dead. She died when I was a year old. Or year and a half. And you father? I don't know. He was sort of all over. Nobody knows. What do you mean by all over? I don't know-- he's here and there. Comes and goes. [laughter] Just comes and goes, eh? Yeah. Now he's a strange guy. So who brought you up? Well, no one really. Kind of grew up like a weed. You did? So your father's a bum? No, not really. Don't tell me he's a nine to fiver. No. What is he, a millionaire? No. An artist? No. What is he, then? Well, he's an Italian, blue-blooded aristocrat. We are the Viscontis of Ferrara, if you must know. Oh, Fletcher, oh, my god. Oh-- What's-- Oh, you disappoint me again. Well, how's that? Well, at first I thought you were a playboy. And then I thought maybe you were farm boy. And then now, you tell me you're a [inaudible]. Well, I can't help that. Well, what are you doing here, then, with all this smog and plastic? Well, I never wanted to come here. If my uncle hadn't died, I never would have been here. But he passed on, and left me this big house in Monterrey, as well as this apartment. And, uh-- Monterrey? Well, that's beautiful? Why don't you live there? It's nice. It's so far away. I, uh-- maybe when I retire when I get older, I'll go up there to live. But right now, I'm too young. Yeah, and what are you after? You want to become rich? Famous? Yeah, like anyone else. I'm after the big one. Ah. 1, 2, [speaking french] Ah, hello there. Did you like her? Eh, not bad. Not bad, huh? SPEAKER (ON TV): In error, he says hello at the start of the season, good-bye at the end of the year, and then lets his bat talk. And when he gets hot, he can really get streaky. Rick Mundy grabs it on a hop, throws it on. White. Oh, you dum dum. It was white, wasn't it? No, it was a red one. By the way, what did you think of that little cutie pie yesterday, huh? She was all right. She was all right, huh? Sweet? Cute. Cute. Do you, uh, would you sort of like me to sort of organize a-- you know, a little threesome? We could have fun, hmm? What do you think of that? That would be all right. That would be all right? I mean, the three of us together, it would be nice. But you two, together-- I wouldn't stand for that. I would kill you. I would kill you, do you know that? [tv in background] NICOLE: My mother was a beautiful woman. She was blond like a Botticelli, she was gay, she wore beautiful dresses. She had so many admirers. She gave beautiful parties in her all-white ballroom. In the summer we would drive through Europe in a huge car, a Hotchkiss. And our chauffeur was called Lalou. He wore a smart uniform. From time to time we would stop on the side of the road, my father would take me on his shoulders, and he would say-- my daughter, my daughter will be the most beautiful young lady in France. And she will marry the richest man in France. And sometimes Lalou would drive us to our estate in the south of France. We had a white farm there, with all the animals white. And then the Germans marched in France. Lalou was sent to the war, and he never came back. And my mother was broken. She took to her bed, and she never got up again. She learned languages, she taught herself Russian, French history. She read Shakespeare and True Detective-- she said they're both unreal. She forgot, I think, that she had two children. Except once, I was invited to a party, and she decided I should be dressed beautifully. And she got up and-- and for three days and three nights, she sewed me a dress. And when I woke up on the third morning, my dress was there on an armchair. She would wake up at night, because she couldn't sleep anymore. And she would wander around the house, like Lady Macbeth. And then she'd go to sleep around 9:00 in the morning, and sleep all day. Then she'd wake up around 6:00 in the afternoon, and she'd start to drink. Didn't quite know who we were, and she, for some reason, became jealous of me. And they were terrible rows. And then one day she tried to throw herself out of the window. Of course we stopped her, but from that moment on, we knew that she was try to kill herself. One night, my father and I thought that she was asleep. We went out for dinner to a restaurant. And when we came back, we found her outside the door step, in the rain, swaying back forth-- she had taken pills. We rushed her to the hospital, but she could not be awakened. The reason I took this is because it's similar to my home. Somebody told me about it when I first came here, and I didn't know my way around California. Ah-hah, maps. Look at that. Are you interested in geography? No, that-- that's where I'm from, Arizona. Oh, really? That's a great state. I was there, once. Oh? With my husband. Your husband? I didn't know that you were married, Nicole? I was. Oh, where-- where is he? He's dead. Say, that's a great clock. Oh, my dad gave that to me. Really? It was in his family. His dad gave it to him. Hmm. And what does your father do? Oh, well he doesn't work anymore, but he used to be a teacher. Really? Of what? Mineralogy? No, no-- these are rocks-- are some things to collect when I was walking around. And I have some-- I see. When you were a little girl. Well, yeah. And are you still going through the horse phase? Uh, no-- Haven't grown out it, yet? Well, this is something that-- I was a kid-- I used to collect them instead of dolls, all over the house. In the bedroom, in the kitchen. Yeah, I noticed. You have some on the icebox. And what's this picture of the moon? Are you a moon freak? Well, no, not really. This friend of mine who worked on the space program, he gave it to me. How interesting. A typewriter in the kitchen-- do you type? Oh, I was thinking of maybe learning how so I could be a secretary. How nice. And do your write something for yourself, sometimes? Well, I did this creative writing course-- Yes? Yeah, so maybe someday I will. Someday you'd like to write? That's nice. You should. Oh, and here are the horses. My goodness-- that's quite a stable you have here. I know, every horse I saw in a store or something, yeah, I love them. Oh, Nicole, are you hungry? Can I fix you something? Are you a good cook? Well, sort of. I'd love to fix you something. But you're not too crazy about washing up, hmm? Seems like I never have time to. You don't. Do you have other rooms? Oh, yeah. Let me show you. I have a bedroom and a bathroom to show. Well. How much do you pay for this place? $150. Hmm. And do you support yourself? Uh, yes I do. Your father doesn't give you any allowance? No, I'm independent, and absolutely free. Good. Oh, how lovely! Here's the little bedroom. Listen-- what's this obsession with animals? You've got them everywhere. I know. I was brought up in the country, so, and I-- I felt like I identified with them, and I love things that are warm and soft. Warm and soft, hmm? I really like animals. That's very sweet. You know, you really have a great looking face. Absolutely great. I don't know what this agent is talking about. What do you mean? He didn't like me? Did he say something to you? No, no, no, no-- don't worry about anything. Don't you worry. You'll see. You and I will do great things together. Yeah? Just trust me. [MUSIC DANIEL BOONE, "BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY"] Well, hello, hello. Come on in. Sue? Who's this over here? Fletcher, glad to meet you. It's a pleasure, I'm sure. Sue, how are you? It's about time you came back. [chattering] [chatter] Fletcher, can you help? Thank you. Oh, Fletcher, this horse is much too tall. This is the place. Everybody out. So green. My goodness. Watch your step, Sue. The only thing about this place that's nice is the air. God, how perfect! Oh, wow-- look at this flower. I love this place. My, god. He's had junk all over the world. [chattering] This is where he lived? Yeah, he lived here. I think there were mail bags that he carried to Calico when he used to ride in Death Valley. It's the truth-- with some friends. Honest to god. My god. This is haunted. Try not to mess it up. Oh, my goodness. What happened? Why is it all covered like this? Well, after he died-- Oh, look. Left me the place, you know, none of the family really cared to-- But this is good. You have some valuable things here. Oh, look. The family was supposed to come pick his things up, but he was such a black sheep, they didn't want anything to do with the old man. He read a lot. He's written books for sale-- I mean five, six books that he had published. Really? But they were firemen, he was a fireman for four years. He-- [excited chatter] Yeah, he wrote a book about it. Look a rocking chair. He was nobody famous. Ooh! [laughter] You don't need that? He made that out of old hangers. He built-- just about made everything in the place. And the family didn't care to come and claim it. You know, the place was not-- Whoopee! Ooh! [laughter] You're all dirty. How many years of dust is this? Uh, three years of heavy dust. That's three years, because I haven't been here in three years. And what is this? More junk. I don't know, he-- geez, I think it's a sledgehammer. Give you an idea of what kind of person he was. Look at what's over there. That's from the prehistoric man. He collected all these things, all over the world. All over the world. Watch yourself. [laughter] It's good you came in, so we can talk about Sue, and tell you what we want to do for her. She has a very small defect, as you can see from these photographs. Her nose is just a little too wide. On the bridge, up here. Right, just in the bridge part. The tip is nice, and we can, I think, refine it a little bit. Now, tell me-- how long is the operation going to last? It takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete the operation and the surgery. An hour and a half? Yes, it takes-- And you give compete anesthesia? Yes, we make her completely asleep for a short time. And then we use a local anesthetic. And is it very painful when she wakes up? No, there's really no pain at all following this operation. Oh, really? No. Are you ready? How you doing? Watch your step, here. Hello, my baby. How are yo u? I'm fine. Did you sleep? Yes, I've been asleep the whole time, Nicole. Does it hurt still? I don't know. Sweetheart. I'm glad-- I'm glad you came to see me. You'll be going away in a few days. No more bruises. I brought you something. Oh, Nicole. Oh, Nicole! Those are beautiful! You like it? God, thank you. You like red roses? I love red roses. And you like baby's breath? Oh, yeah. I love baby's breath. Oh, good. You're a sweetheart. Now, tell me about the nurses. Are they sweet to you? Yeah, I don't really notice, because I'm-- sleeping all the time. I'm tired. You've been sleeping? And what did they give you for breakfast? And there's the surprise! Oh, Nicole! This is very American. Do you like the lamp? And this one, isn't it beautiful? And look at all the pots you have. The photograph! And look at the old coffee maker, coffee grinder. And this is a child's horse. Isn't it pretty? Oh, Nicole! And I had the chimney all bleached for you. And the leather couch. And I have also a painting of a ship to go with it. Isn't it lovely? I love it. And this couch is very Oriental. I thought it would suit your personality. And finally-- Nicole! Look at this brass bed. It's fantastic! This quilt! Yes? The [inaudible] quilt. Oh, my god. Isn't it delicious? Yeah, another horse. Oh, I love it. And then we have another surprise. My closet-- they're new. Nicole! But wait-- there's something else. Slow down a minute, wait a minute. Nicole? OK, boys and girls-- OK, you two. [chattering] Absolutely famished. I'll get it, Sue. Do you think the sun will come out, Laslo? [chattering] Where is the boat? Which one is it? Oh, yes! Look, Fletcher. The one with the flag. Come on, everyone. Let's get going. We're going away for three weeks, it seems. That's the one down there, you see? I want to get tan. No, no, it's quite the small boat. But you'll see, it's quite comfortable. [chattering] Very nice. -Linda! -What? Get dressed! [chattering] Now, I understand I have to take my shoes off. Help, somebody. Here, I'll take that. [chattering] What's your birthday? Carefully, carefully, on the-- Let's go. That's called a hatch. Down the hatch. Down the hatch. [chatter] Just wait a second. Look at that. -Oh, clever. Isn't that nice? Just everything is down. Oh, Laslo. Just beautiful, Laslo. Wonderful! Fletcher, sweetheart, will you get me my tennis shoes? Yes, you should put them on. Laslo, hand me that black bag. OK, now I show you how it looks inside. Fletcher, would you help me, please? Would you help me, opening? Sure. Is this the hatch, Laso? It's pretty tight. No, not hardly. I would oil it a little bit. Maybe it will-- [drumming] [rock music playing] [chatter] [laughter] Why don't you two dance? Dance. The dog. I think he's a Jamaican dog. [barking] Shh! [laughter] Could I, uh-- OK, sweetheart, night-night! Good night! Now don't-- don't stay up talking too late. Good night, Sue. Good night, I'll see you in the morning. I had such a nice time. I'm glad you did. I hope you'll sleep well. Come on, Laslo, get going. Night, night! Good night, everyone! Excuse me, excuse me just a moment, I have to say something. Oh, come on now-- Sue, I didn't say good night to you, I just remembered. I hope you'll sleep well. Good night, Laslo. Coming. Good night. Good night. Good night, Sue. Good night! Laslo, those boys of yours. They-- What are you doing? I'm trying-- I'm cleaning up. You don't need to do that. He's such a bastard, this child. Yes, he's a bastard. No, no, he's not a bastard. Just roll away those blankets. Wait, wait just a second. Wait a second. No, Laslo. This is very important, no-- believe me. Why don't you listen to me? It's very important, I'm telling you. Laslo! Come on, I told it's important. Laslo! Oh, come on, now. Oh, well. [knocking] Yeah, just a minute. [knocking] One moment, so sorry to disturb you. I just need something very important. Sorry, forgive me, I just need-- oh, do you mind? Just this-- I need. Did I-- did I disturb you or something? No, Laslo, no. I wanted to say good night, I forgot before. You know, I really want you to be very comfortable. Just make yourselves completely at home-- and you, too. And I think I better go now. See you tomorrow. Good night. Good night, Laslo. Sleep well now. Sure, Laslo. Nicole! Nicole! Nicole! Shh! All right, all right. [laughter] Yes, sir. Don't sit there, I haven't finished this bed. This one is-- All I want is to give you a nice-- Shh. Where are your pajamas? I haven't brought pajamas. Oh, dear I don't know where they are. They took it, I think. What do you want to do? I don't know. Go up? OK. So let's go. Come on. The little bitch, pretending that she couldn't dance. She could do it all right. And Mr. Oldsmobile loved it, too. She's got no right to do that. Dammit, she's got no right. [sighs] Oh, dammit. Why do they keep the light on so long? It's quite obvious what they're doing. They'd be fools if they didn't. I introduced him to Nicole. She says it's for the better of our relationship. She wants to know who I'm involved with. But it's almost paranoid. For example, you know the house? The new house that she bought me, Fletcher? Sometimes-- sometimes I will come home to this dark house, and I immediately, see, I jump out of my car, and I turn-- I turn on the garage lights. And I go in the house, and each room I pass there I turn on the lights, because there's just something ominous-- something very, very spooky about my own home. It's not my own house, at all. Or another thing-- when she moved me into this house, after my plastic surgery, remember? And, um, she'd come by before and criticize all these things that I'd collected. Like, I've always collected little objects, things that I'd picked up from like the beach-- driftwood, or things that I made, or my brother's airplanes, anything. But she threw it all away, and bought me all these fancy things, and it's not me. I don't know, Sue. If you're as miserable as you say you are with her, why don't you just pick yourself up and go? Leave, just like that. It's just as easy. -I can't. What did you do before you met her? You were alone, weren't you? Yeah. You said she made an investment in you-- dollars and sense. But that's nothing. You think anyone makes an investment just for someone else, selfishly? Had a good night? Yeah, why? Yeah. [boat engine humming] Aren't you cold, Nicole? No, I'm fine. Here, let me grab that. Hi, skipper. Hi, skipper, how did you sail? Did you have enough wind out there to get the genny up? None of your business. Gee, we're really sorry that we missed you. I really don't care. We can explain. I'll tell you what happened with us. My wife sprained her ankle, we had to take her to the hospital. I'm sorry about that, but that's not my concern. It was an emergency situation. As far as Rick, I sent him over to the marine trainer, I-- You should have been here and you weren't. So you are fired. That's all I have to say. Get off my boat. Anyway, you can't go sailing without the winch. I don't want any argument. All of you are fired. Get off my boat. I tell you, it will never happen again. No it won't, because you won't be on my boat. Let me explain, because this was a mistake. That's the end of it. Get off my boat. [speaking spanish] You're 30 minutes late, you know that? 15, dear. 30. 15-- what does it matter? It matters. I don't like people who are unreliable. Oh, because I'm 30 minutes late, I'm unreliable? Yes. Last time you kept me waiting for an hour, I didn't say anything. That's totally different. I'm a woman, you're a man. What difference does that make? I just don't like to be kept waiting. To tell you the truth, I have completely lost interest. You can go by yourself. All right, fine. Then I'll go by myself. -Yeah. -Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, Fletcher-- come on. Jesus Christ, Nicole. I just don't understand you. Since the day of the boat, you're a different person. I can't get next to you, I can't talk to you. You're a bag of nerves. What happened? You changed, too, you know. What's the matter. I mean, you disappeared for three days, then you-- I didn't disappear. I told you I had to go away. Am I your property, or something? I cannot go away for a few days? What's so important that you have to do? I mean, you've given up your job, you've given up your apartment. You see, that's what I mean. You made me give up my job and my apartment. And you treat me like I'm your son, like a little pet on a leash. Oh, so that's the way you see it. I haven't had to answer questions like that since I was 10 years old. Well that is not the way it happened. You just stayed on and on, and you just stayed on forever. Until one morning you just forgot to go back to that little pig sty of yours. I don't need this abuse from you. There are plenty of places I can go to-- Oh, yes, you do? Where do you think I've been for two days? With friends of mine. I have many friends around. Oh, you think they're going to put up with you forever? And I have my apartment, I only rented for two months. It's still-- For two months you sleep in a park. And you saw my place in Monterrey, you loved it, remember? That ghost house? That ghost house. In the middle of the forest? Look, I won't even bother you anymore. Goodbye, Nicole. Fletcher! Fletcher! Fletcher! Fletcher! Where are you going? Come back! Fletcher, come back! Fletcher! Fletcher, I didn't mean it. Please, now come on. I love you, please don't go! Oh! Fletcher! Come on, please come back! Don't do that to me! Fletcher-- don't do that to me! Don't! I don't want you to leave me alone, no! Please come back! No, please-- [sobbing] Does Sue know about the row that you had with Fletcher? No, she doesn't know about it. She was gone already. And soon after, just immediately after the row, Fletcher left. He left for the airport. He couldn't have called her. He was already late for his plane. Yeah, but he could've stopped on the road and called her. I don't see how. Or is there any chance that Sue will go up to the house? Why the hell would she go to the house? Nicole, you and I both know why he would do that. Well, I'll tell you one thing-- she's not going to go to the house, because I'm going to be keeping her company all night. I'm going to stay with the little bitch, and I'm going to be nice to her, and I'm going to take her to the beach the next morning. That's why. So now way, no way she can be there. All right, Nicole. I-- I still don't like it. You've got a very nice little alibi, you know where that leaves me? No alibi at all. You're fine, you're fine. I don't like it. I don't like it, not a bit. Come on Duke, let's go. I'll let you out, just one second. Wait, Duke, wait. There you are. Good boy. Don't run away too far. Susie! Sue? Susie? Oh dear, we loved each other. "The Cloud Comes to Quibbletown. The cloud will come, as soon as it starts, on a hot incoming day. No one will see it coming, because it will be shapeless, mild-looking, just a gray film in the sky. Muggy day, people will say. It's not the heat, it's the humidity." [screaming] [barking] Susie! Nicole! Nicole! Stop it! Duke! Duke! Get off! [moaning] Stop it! Oh, my god! Oh, no! Stop it, Duke! [barking] Stop it! Stop it! Duke! He's gone crazy. Got to go back. Got to go back. Oh, Christ. Dammit, what am I doing? I've got to think-- I'm going to have an accident. No, that won't stop-- won't stop a mistake. I blew it. Goddamn alibi. Now Malcolm is going up there. Oh, if only they had a telephone. Lady? Are you all right? Can I help you? Oh, she is crazy. God, that town is full of freaks. Now, what was I going to do? I've got to get the map, I've got to change clothes-- oh my god, I'll never get there on time. It's midnight already. Oh, Christ-- got to get the other car. Other car. Oh, god, I hope nobody recognizes me. No, they're all asleep. It's-- it's OK. Hey babe, what's going on? Aren't I coming with ya? Take your hands out. Get away from me! Ah, come on. Let me in, let's go for a ride. Get out! Let me in the car. [yelling] I've got to hurry. Oh, if I get through tonight, I swear I'll get rid of this bungalow. Damn key. Oh, this car won't go. God, I'm tired. Oh, this traffic. Oh, this is what I would get-- all the red lights. All the red lights. What are we, rats? Red light, stop. Green light, go. There we go, go. Get out of my way. Sop kissing, you fools. I want to stop someone. Keep calm-- maybe Malcolm won't get there on time, maybe he'll have changed his mind. That's right. No, he won't. I know him. He just carries out, he just carries out. He just does it all, he just gets there on time. Well maybe he will have changed his mind. He wasn't sure. That's right, maybe he won't have done it. Maybe he won't get there on time. Maybe he'll have a tire blow out. Maybe-- maybe he'll be hungry, maybe he'll stop somewhere. Maybe-- maybe he'll need to pee, maybe who knows? Maybe need to sleep, maybe-- I don't know. [honking] Anybody here? Anybody in this place. Hey? Hey! Yes, ma'am, can I help you? Hi, can you fill it up? Medium. Sure will. Thank you. God, he's telephoning right now, I bet he is. I bet he is. Those detectives, that's all they need. An extra clue. Oh, god-- what an idiot I am. I blew it. I know, that's all he needed, that detective. The fat one, yeah. That's all he needed, just a few more clues. God-- I should have gone back for Sue, I should have gone back and looked. Oh, god, what an idiot I am. All they needed was just those clues-- all they needed was just-- I know that crazy old lady called them. I know she did. Oh, god-- my faith. They're going to report me, they're going to describe me. I know it. They're going to describe me. What should I do? Maybe I can bleach my hair. Oh, what's the mater with me? I'm just having nightmares. I haven't slept, that's what it is. Fletcher? Fletcher! Fletcher, my darling, where are you? Fletcher! [screaming] Malcolm, Malcolm! Malcolm, stop! Malcolm, stop! Where are you? Malcolm, answer me, Malcolm! Oh, Fletcher, where are you? Fletcher! Fletcher! Malcolm! Malcolm, no, don't! Malcolm, don't! Malcolm! No, oh, my god. Oh! What did you do? I did what the hell you asked! Why did you do that? Will you shut up for Christ's sake! You monster! Nicole-- what the hell do you think you're-- get off of him! For Christ's sake! Get away from me! Oh, sweetheart, please. Please answer me. Don't look at me like that. Oh, darling, he didn't mean to hurt you. My baby, my sweetheart, he didn't mean to hurt you. Oh, please don't look at me like that. Oh, my sweetheart, everything will be all right. Please don't look at me like that. It will be all right, I swear to you. Come on now, wake up. Come with me, let's go home. We want to go home, do you hear me? [choral music]
