MAN 1: All right, man. I feel like we can't go too much further without talking about Carina Williams and Mike Devonoff. This is topical shit. And it's kind of on the minds of everybody, man. MAN 2: I mean, I agree with you that it is probably one of the most divisive cases we've had, 'cause it does feel like we're almost on a 50-50 split about right and wrong, which is, like, we should never be there. -MAN 1: Mm-hmm. -MAN 2: But, like, there's a good percentage of people MAN 2: But, like, there's a good percentage of people who are like, "This case happened a while ago. It shouldn't matter anymore. This guy's, you know, a hero. -MAN 1: Yeah . -MAN 2: He's done so much for the community. Especially when you think about the medical community." But then also, a large group of people who feel as if we have seen this happen before. We have seen these cases. People have tried to get justice. -And then they're just left hanging dry. MAN 1: 'Cause everybody's bringing up the statutory limitation. -MAN 2: Hmm. -MAN 1: It's been over ten years. Well, you know, the idea over ten years -doesn't matter to Carina Williams. -MAN 2: Hmm. MAN 1: She's been living with it for over ten years, which is a heavy weight to have. -MAN 2: Yeah. -MAN 1: Everybody feels emboldened. And, you know, the judge is rushin' this verdict because of the protest and the fear that he has of what's gonna happen once the verdict comes in. MAN 2: I mean, every fuckin' news outlet is gonna have some sort of reaction to it, so I feel like they're just trying to get this thing out there, and the consequences of this case could last. -MAN 1: Yeah. -MAN 2: It could just ripple into a whole bunch of things that I think no one is ready to even deal with. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [Cal clearing throat] You're nervous. CAL: I'm not nervous. You're doing the thing. Says the girl stuck in the k-hole. Oh. I just can't with Black Twitter. CAL: Why? What're they saying? Nothing. Just the tweets about the Devonoff trial. -CAL: Hmm. - So many memes. -[chuckles] -CAL: Got it. -How far are we? -I think we're right around the corner. SIRI: Turn right, and the destination is on the corner. -We're right around the corner. -[chuckles] How are you feeling? -Nervous. -It's gonna be fun seeing all of them. -Rish, too. -You're gonna meet Miles and all my buddies -from back home. -Home, I know. Yeah. And they're mostly... White. Yeah. [both chuckles] Well, I was gonna say opinionated, so... Well, I'm a big girl. And I can take care of myself. Just don't go in there prying. You know I know how you get. -I do not pry. -Yes, you do. Okay. I totally pry. What are you gonna say to Rish? He can't still be mad at you for telling the truth. [chuckles] Hey, look at me. It's going to be fine. You guys have known each other your entire lives. Doesn't that mean something? Yeah, but look. Hey. You know what? He's got a new girl. It's been years. He doesn't like any of my posts. Well, have you told him that you sold your script? He will have to be happy about that. And you know that I take really good pictures. Cal! Seriously. We just stopped trying. That's all. Well, if not now, when? Besides, you're really cute when you try. -No promise it ends in bromance. -[Izzy spluttering] -IZZY: I just feel like-- -What do you feel like, Iz? I just feel like you guys are funny. How so? Like, if y'all met today, would y'all even fuck with each other? [sighs] -Heyo! -Heyo! VINNY: Cal, yes. Come here. Come here. Hey. [both exclaims] -Ah! -Ah! Still got it! -CAL: Come on, dude! -VINNY: Still got it. That's right. That's right. Hey, Izzy, meet Whiskey. -Hi! -Hey. -Vinny is fine, too. -Oh, for sure. Thanks so much for having us. -Oh, what, are you kidding? Thank you for making the tribe up here. -I appreciate it. -We brought booze. -Oh, Shannon loves red. -CAL: Nice. Who doesn't love a good red? [chuckles] -Shannon Chang, there she is. -Hi. Hey. Hey, hey. This is Izzy, my girlfriend. -Hi. -Hi, sorry, I'm a hugger. Yes. Yes, you are. Oh, I love this sweater. Oh, thank you. But, oh, my God, your hair. -I love it! -Thank you! You guys, this is such a nice neighborhood. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Vinny's place. I just come over for the nice ocean breeze. -And to steal my soy sauce. -[Izzy chuckles] It'd be funny if it wasn't true. He's more Asian than I am sometimes. VINNY: Stop, stop, stop! Come on. Let me show you guys around. Is anybody else here yet? Uh, Sam, Rish, and a couple others. Let's go. REPORTER: Thousands of protestors and supporters on both sides have descended upon the courthouse to have their voices... -SAMUEL: Heyo! -Heyo! [Samuel chuckles] SAMUEL: What's up, buddy? Hey, little man. [exclaims, blows raspberry] [blows raspberry] CAL: Come on, man. -SAMUEL: Oh, come on. -CAL: Hey, man. Good to see you. You good? -Oh, you know, man. You know? -Hey, this is Izzy. -Hey! -Hi! -Hi! Oh. -[Izzy chuckles] Oh! I'm Sam! And I've heard a lot of lovely things about you. -It's not true. -Oh, you're right. You're right. He's been trolling you this whole time. -Yeah. -I am totally not surprised at all. [chuckles] We're kidding. We're kidding. It's super great to meet you. -Oh, I know. I know it is. -Mm, mm, mm. -[chuckles] -Oh, hey. This is Kayla. -IZZY: Hi! -Hi, Izzy! Nice to meet you. -Yeah. -KAYLA: Oh. -RISH: Hey, I'm Rish. Cal. -Izzy. Nice to meet you. -Hey. -What's up, man? Izzy, you want something to drink? Uh, what do we have? SAMUEL: Oh. Bring on the whiskey, Whiskey. -Mm. -Oh, don't tempt him. Wine? -Yes, please. -Great. -Cal, you good? -Beer's good. -Gotcha. -IZZY: So, why do they call you Whiskey? Mm. 'Cause this guy can drink anyone under the table. -VINNY: Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. -SAMUEL: Oh, no, no, no, no. You love it. He once finished a fifth of JD and then aced his interview at USC. Mm. That was Tennessee bourbon. And trust me, it was a lot smoother going down. -[Samuel chuckling] -[Rish chuckling] SAMUEL: Yeah. Not so smooth on the way out. -KAYLA: Ew! -[Samuel chuckling] Well, his last name's Jameson, so, you know? -That, too. -Yeah. That didn't get old fast back in high school. And also, you guys drank way too much. -[groans, chuckles] -Well... -[Samuel groans] -[scoffs] RISH, SAMUEL & CAL: Yeah. Wait. So, all of y'all went to high school together? Yeah. I thought four years with these clowns would be enough, but, uh, somehow, this guy scooped me up. With a giant spoon. Ugh! -Aw. -IZZY: That is adorable. So, how long have you guys been together. Oh, just a few months. Five. Right. CAL: Is that the same as us? We're coming up on sevenish. -CAL: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Hmm. Yeah. By the way, who's that? Oh, that's my girlfriend, Gen. [reporter speaking indistinctly on TV] RISH: Gen! Sorry. Pardon me. [Izzy chuckling] GEN: Hi. -CAL: Hey. -Hello. Uh, I'm Gen. Nice to meet y'all. -Hi. -Still watching the circus? Yes. Uh, my eyes are glued to the TV. Oh, the Devonoff trial? I was just reading the tweets on the way here. KAYLA: About how much of a piece of shit he is? SAMUEL: Is it still going on? Last I checked, people were kinda split when it came to opinions on the whole thing. RISH: Gen works in healthcare, so she's a lit1tle bit invested. -Just a tad bit. -Mm. -[chuckles] -The trial has everyone kind of on an edge. CAL: I mean, it's crazy. A final deliberation in the final hour like this, it's like a movie. I mean, it's crazy. Mm! Dude, I spaced! Congrats on your movie. -Thanks, man! Thank you. Thanks, man. Thanks, dude. -Oh. Yeah, that's so cool. Wait, wait. What happened? -Cal just sold his first script. -What? -Wow! Congrats. -GEN: Oh, gosh! That's amazing! Congratulations! Thank you. It's a crap shit of a business. Honestly, I'm very lucky. Very lucky, yeah. Dude, stop. That's awesome, man. Awesome. Yeah. Baby, it really is. Thank you. So, yeah. I wrote a script once. So, what's it about? Oh, it was so long ago. I don't remember. Oh, sorry. Not you. His. -Oh. -Oh. Oh, man. -[chuckles] -[Izzy chuckling] [chuckles] It's actually a horror story. It's about a bunch of high school friends who reunite after ten years. They get stuck in a beach house. And then they resort to cannibalism, so... [smacks lips] Fucking kidding. It's a rom-com. -Oh! Oh! -[all laugh] Oh. [chuckles] -[all laughs] -[speaks indistinctly] -Heyo! -Oh, yes! Yes! SAMUEL, RISH & CAL: Oh! Where my boys at? Rish! Oh, my God, bro. -[Rish grunts] -Look at you. You look shredded! -RISH: Oh, man. -What's your secret, huh? RISH: Spiked coffee and cigs. [Miles chuckling] -Hey, Cal. What up, my dude? -What's up, dude? -[Miles grunts] -CAL: Too long, bro. -Hi! -IZZY: Hi! -I'm Veronica. -[chuckles] -IZZY: So nice to meet you. -So nice to meet you. Oh, my God. I love your hair. I mean, I would kill for mine to look like this. -Thank you. -[Veronica chuckles] -It's beautiful. -Thanks. Mule, look at you! What? What? You look good! -Oh! -[laughs] -You good? -Yeah, yeah. I'm good. How are you? Good. I'm fucking good. Yeah? Good, man. -Good to see you, bro. -SAMUEL: Good to see you, too, man. [groans] -Baby, come meet my boys. -[chuckles] Oh. [chuckles] Hello, boys. -CAL, RISH & SAMUEL: Hey. -I've heard so much about you. Miles says y'all go way back. VINNY, CAL & RISH: Uh... -Kinda, sorta. Yeah. -VINNY: Um, kinda sorta. What a bunch of assholes! [Cal chuckles] -Here. Would you like to put your stuff down? -Oh, yes. That'd be great. Oh, baby. Before that, can we just please? -What do you mean? Can I not just put my stuff down? -No, no, baby. It's a tradition. Okay, fine. But one. -Thank you. -Yes. -MILES & RISH: Shots! -Yes! [Samuel cheers] CAL: Let's go, let's go, let's go. [chuckles] [exclaims] Okay, Vin, pace yourself. I'm not gonna be holding your hair back this time. RISH & MILES: Ooh! Okay. I love you. Just kidding. Honestly, he'll probably be holding mine back. -[Izzy chuckling] -[Cal chuckling] MILES: All the boys are back in town. Oh, man. It's great to be back, man. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, of course. -[speaks indistinctly] KAYLA: Does it ever bother you, people just come up and touch your hair like that? -All the time. -[chuckles] [laughs] Is, uh... is Taylor coming? VINNY: Last I heard, he was flying in from Dubai, so... You know that guy, you tell me. RISH: Oh, that fucking guy. Did you see his last post? He got, like, 100,000 likes. That's gotta make him a social media celebrity, right? Yeah, whatever. All right, come on. A toast. To the reunion of the Mirada Seven boys and girl. [clicks tongue] MILES: And thank you, Whiskey, so much for hosting, and thank you, baby. Thank yo for being DD tonight. It's just gonna be hell from here on out. -[Vinny chuckles] -Oh, Lord. -[chuckles] -[laughs] No, I'm just kidding. But not really. -Hmm. -[laughs] -Cheers! Love you, boys. -CAL: Hey, hey, hey! VINNY, SHANNON, GEN & CAL: Cheers! Cheers. -IZZY: Cheers. -SHANNON: Cheers. [chuckles] [sighs] -[exhales] -Whoo! Mm. Let me show you where you can put your stuff down. -Vinny, cigarette. -Oh, that would be great. Thank you! VINNY: Hey, babe. We are going to go smoke. So, if you need to find us, that where we will be. -RISH: Yes. -Okay. I guess we're seeing the bedroom. This way. -CAL: It's beautiful. -MILES: Come on now. Come on now. [grunts] Dude, it's so good to see Gen again. -Congrats, bro. -RISH: Oh, yeah. Thanks, man. We're going strong. MILES: Oh. CAL: That's great. Do those even work? -You wanna try it? -Nah, I don't fuck with that shit. Strict rules from wifey. People dying from them, too, you know? Guessing you don't want a hit then. VINNY: How was the flight? Oh, it was fine. It's just, you know, American, you don't get a lot of leg space. I mean, it's cool you were even able to come out. -[coughs] -No, I'm good. What about you, Whiskey? New old girl, huh? Ah, you know what? I'm just trying to relive those glory days. SAMUEL: It's cool to see you two together. -Yeah. -I haven't seen her since, like, the high school graduation party. -Yeah. -You know what, guys? We're really happy together. So, thanks. And C-money. Hmm? -Iggy? What's her name? -Izzy. Bro. -Oh. -Oh, yeah. My bad. Yes. -She's super cool. -CAL: Thanks, man. Thank you. -Yeah, I really like her. -Thanks. Appreciate it, man. Diggin' that dark chocolate. [scoffs] We just vibe, man. That's it. Geez. -[laughs] -CAL: Come on. No, but, dude, seriously, congrats on the script, man. I saw the post. Seriously, shit, you're making it out there, huh? Thanks, dude. Thanks. Honestly, it's just-- if it goes into production, then we can actually celebrate, so... What does it mean? You haven't been paid yet? No. They get you, like, a larger check once the movie actually goes into production, so... How much larger? All right, fine. Don't say anything, Mr. Hollywood. Geez. CAL: It's a lucrative industry. You just-- you gotta ride the ebbs and the flow, so I can start living like this guy. [chuckles] -SAMUEL: For real. -You know what? I am proud that I do well, so... Hey, man. Kudos to you. I mean, I couldn't do it. It's just too un... unreliable. Like how do you start a family, huh? Like with the new girl for instance. Whoa, dude. we just-- we started dating, like, seven months ago. It's not like we're diving into anything yet, so... -Yeah, I get it. I get it. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. -What about you, Samuel? Is that, uh, pink-haired chick yours? No. No, dude. She's not property. Kayla's just a friend. Oh, yeah. A friend that you're smashin'. -[laughs] -SAMUEL: Dude, no, man. What? I'm just kidding, Muel. Relax. SAMUEL: Yeah. Veronica. She's great. Congrats, man. Does she work in motor, too? No, estates manager. -Oh. -CAL & RISH: Cool. -Nice. -Yeah. Yeah. All right. Don't pretend to be interested, guys. [all laugh] MILES: But I do have some good news for you. -Cool. -Okay. So, this is the guest bedroom. Um, feel free to put your stuff down anywhere. VERONICA: Oh, my God. I love how spacious it all is. IZZY (OS/ON): And you get another closet. SHANNON: Yeah. Vin's been putting more of his stuff here, so I can, you know, bring some more of my stuff. -[Izzy chuckling] -Oh, sweetheart, I get it. Before Miles popped the question, he used to leave his stuff at my place all the time. That's right. Congratulations! Thank you! -GEN: Have you decided on a date? -KAYLA: Or place? Uh, no, and, no. Um, but I mean, we've just been so busy, and I was kinda thinking Hawaii. I mean, like, who doesn't love a little wedding getaway? Mm. Beautiful any time of the year. I've actually never been. -What? -IZZY: Really? Oh, it's so nice. And so expensive. -Oh, yeah. -But I mean, we'll probably just use our miles. Oh, yeah. Are there enough miles for the guests, too? VERONICA: Oh, well... KAYLA: I'm just kidding. [chuckles] Oh, no! Yeah, right. [laughs] Of course. Of course. Can I just say I love this whole thing you have going on? A tattoo, it's wow. Just goes all the way around there. I love it. [chuckles] KAYLA: Thanks. VERONICA: I'm way too scared of needles. Oh, and, Gen. Gen, right? -Yes. -You are so beautiful. -Oh. -What are you... where are you from? GEN: Oh. Uh, my family's from Pakistan. I thought I heard an accent. -But I feel like it's, like, more British. -[chuckles] Good ear. Yes. Uh, I was raised in London. And I came to the states a couple years ago. That's amazing. Have you ever considered modeling? [scoffs] No. The lifestyle's not for me. Oh, okay. [chuckles] Mm. You're here for your PA, right? Yes. Healthcare is my passion. -SHANNON: Mm. -KAYLA: How do you feel about the trial? Uh, just being, like, a nurse who works with other women and all. Oh, you're a nurse! That's so sweet. GEN: Yeah, uh, it's a bit complicated. Uh, especially because I'm not American-born. Standards are a little different from across the pond. How so? Uh, well, maybe we don't have to get into it right now. Uh, but perhaps a little later. Uh, I could use another drink. -Yes. More drinks. -KAYLA: Yes. -Okay. -SHANNON: Shall we? Kitchen? IZZY: Okay. -Oi! -SAMUEL: What? -=CAL: What? -You're already trying? -Yep! -That's awesome! Yep. Yeah, man. But, oh, don't say anything, 'cause she made me promise not to tell anyone. [laughs] [chuckles] -He's clearly fuckin' this. -RISH: So, that's why she says she's... -Yes. -Dude, you're gonna have, like, a little you running around in, like, a year. -I know. -I'm so jealous! I know. Can you believe it? Like, me, this guy? -Yeah. -RISH: Yeah. RISH: This guy who played ten straight beer pong games in a row and won. Still holds the house record that has not been beaten. Well, hold up. Pretty sure he lost unless he was taking PEDs. I'm just saying. MILES: It's called a Jaeger, motherfucker. You wanna go? -Oh! -Oh! Hey, hey, hey. If you guys wanna settle this, I got good news for you. I got the table set up right there. -Shotgun Miles' team. -Okay, all right. CAL: Let's go, bro. Let's go. All right. Are you gonna be able to see this time? [chuckles] Okay, okay. Yeah. Uh, you only get one of those. You know that. All right. Yeah. No, I know. I know. One. My bad. [exhales] CAL: All right. Geez, man. Honestly, shouldn't be so sensitive about it. Okay. -MILES: Let's do it. -CAL: Let's do it. -SHANNON: Let's get drinks. -Wait. Is that really a thing? SHANNON: Oh, yeah. W... what? Yellow fever. [chuckles] Yellow fever? Who has yellow f-- right, got it. Wait. Does Vinny only date Asian girls? Well, not only. And to be fair, I haven't dated any Asian guy in a while, so... Hey. If you vibe, you vibe, right? That's right. Well, it must be nice learning each other's cultures, though, right? Yeah. I did teach him to make dumplings once. And now, he won't stop making them. [chuckles] [Gen chuckles] [chuckles] I'm not sure how much white culture there is to learn. Well, I mean, American. I'm pretty sure Shannon's American, too, right? I am. [chuckles] No, right. Yeah, of course. I do-- no, right. Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. But I mean, you know, to your point, we do try to learn things from each other, and, you know, sometimes it can be difficult, because simply we're just not from each other's backgrounds, -so... -VERONICA: Mm-hmm. Right. Thinking back on all the Caucasian boys I've dated, I can certainly relate. [Izzy chuckling] [Shannon chuckling] -Cheers to that. -IZZY: Cheers! [chuckles] SHANNON: Ooh! Let me get you some white from the fridge. -May I also have water? -SHANNON: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. -GEN: Good for you, DD'ing. -I know. If I didn't love him so much. [chuckles] IZZY: Right. Hey, Vin! Can I, uh, switch this to music? Yeah. Go for it. -MILES: Get some tunes on! -SAMUEL: Watch those elbows. RISH: Yeah, let's go! Oh, it's just a song, baby. Let's go! RISH: Whoo! [indistinct chatter] [chuckles] Okay. Cheers. SAMUEL: Oh. Oh, my God, dude. -Yes. -[cheers] -Wait, wait, wait, wait! -Oh! Come on! [chuckles] IZZY, CAL & IZZY: Another shot! [all cheer] [Miles cheers] ♪ Everything will get better ♪ ♪ ...till leave this town ♪ ♪ In, like, forever ♪ [indistinct lyrics] Yeah, okay. Everybody remembers the house-rules. And watch those elbows. I'm watching you. Ooh! What are the teams? It's Japanese Whiskeys versus the Lazy Loggers. That's not really what you call yourselves. -CAL: Mm. -A classic matchup. And it was established in '08. Mm. They still talk about us. Who's "they"? Uh, Rish. Cool. Uh, we're gonna need to refill the water cups, too. -I got you. -Yeah, thank you. It's sick. Come on. Eye to eye, let's go. -SAMUEL: Eye to eye? -Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I see this. So, everybody wants to act like they care about climate change, but really, if we wall went vegan, we'd produce greenhouse gasses by about 70 percent, which is a huge amount if you think about it. -If you really care about-- -You ladies good? Yeah, great. So great. Um, you know, I'm actually gonna go check on the kitchen, but, uh, I would love to hear more about this fun, little diet you're on. Just don't go anywhere. KAYLA: Okay. VERONICA: How can I help in here? SHANNON: Oh, no. You're fine. Just enjoy yourself. Oh, no. Please let me help. I love to help. It's the Southern hospitality in me. When I see kitchen prep, I come running. [chuckles] Okay. Um, we'll season the veggies then. Yes, perfect. Great. VINNY: There she is. Hey, baby. You need another drink? Oh, no, I'm good. Thank you. How's it going over there? Uh, good. You know, just talking smack about you per the usual. -How are the boys? -A whole lot of life talk going on out there. Uh, Miles is trying to have a kid. Can you believe that? Oh, and, hey. You weren't supposed to know that. SHANNON: Hmm. Yeah. Oh, and, hey. Are we using the instant pot? Uh, I didn't bring it. I thought you said we were. No, I didn't. [chuckles] Why didn't you just leave it over here from the last time you used it? SHANNON: Uh, I don't know. You know you can actually leave stuff here, right? Yes. Yes, of course. I don't think we need the pot tonight, so... [kisses] Oh! Oh! [chuckles] My bad, Chang. I was just grabbing another beer. -[grunts] -VINNY: Slammed in. [chuckles] [clears throat] Veggies are seasoned. What else? Um... Oh, why don't you help me set the table? Look at you! Such a great hostess. No, no, no. Um, I'm just following Vinny's lead. He's more of a people person. Oh, stop. You are wonderful. And, you know, I am so glad to meet one of Miles' childhood friends that is not a man. [chuckles] I mean, although you can clearly keep up with them in the drinking department, I can tell you're a class act. -[chuckles] -Thank you. No, thank you for having us over. Seriously. RISH: And there she goes. What? It's just my second drink. Oh, I know. I was just being silly. So, that's Cal, right? How long have you two been bickering again? How long since your last cigarette? You know that's not nice. I'm trying to quit. No. I know. Right. I was just-- Stop letting little things become big things, Rish. (♪♪♪) Ooh! Don't hate me, but I gotta start setting up. -Dude, what? -I don't want Shannon to mess up the dumplings. Okay. Well, who's gonna be my teammate? Uh, Izzy? Oh, no. I ran track. Ball throwing is not my thing. -Hey, yo, Rish! -Dude. It's chill, man. Calm down. Hey, I gotta start setting up. Sub in for me. [smacks lips] All right! Spice and rice it is! -Wow! -Yeah. That's real. It's real. VINNY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hope you're ready, pal, 'cause they're bringing the heat. -MILES: Born ready! -Yeah! Oh, we got curry rice up in here. SAMUEL: Yeah! All right. Calm your ass down, whitebread. Eye to eye? -Yikes! Aggro much? -[grunts] -MILES: Oh! -Told you. -Curry? Rice? -I mean, I try to tell 'em it's spice and rice, but whatever. Okay. Um, I'm gonna get a snack. You want anything? I'm okay. Thanks, babe. -Okay. -Bye. Ready? Ready? Go, one, two, three. [Miles cheering] Hey! You need any help or anything? Oh, no, no. You're totally fine. Having fun? IZZY: Yeah, I am. Thanks. So, is it fun seeing all the guys -back together again like this? -[scoffs] Fun could be a word to describe it. [chuckles] But, um... I know Vinny's been looking forward to this for a long time. I mean, he hasn't seen some of these guys in years. I mean, almost a decade. And he was right. As soon as they all got back together, it's like a moment hadn't passed. [chuckles] So, what was Cal like back then? Spill the tea. Oh, my gosh. He was the best. And everybody always thought we were hooking up, probably 'cause we were the only two Asians in the circle, but... -Did you ever? -Oh, no, no, no. Never. We were always just friends. I mean, I'm not judging at all, girl. It happens between friends. It's whatever. Yeah, of course, but no. [chuckles] -IZZY: I mean, you're beautiful. -Oh. IZZY: So, only Vinny? Really? I don't buy it. I mean, they're all pretty great guys. -Samuel maybe. -Uh, no, girl. [chuckles] Oh! I mean, I'm totally not judging at all. Like, we all have our past. Mine isn't pretty. I just know Cal loves y'all. Uh, no. Um... [clicks tongue] ...we just used to see each other at parties and stuff, so... I think I'm gonna need another. -Refill? -Uh, yes. -Yes. -And please, thank you. [Shannon chuckling] [chuckles] GEN: So, Kayla, what do you do? I work in graphic design. Hmm, sounds cool. I know nothing about it. That's why I can charge so much. Makes sense. Capitalism 101. So, how about you? Um, you always wanted to be a nurse, or maybe... Pretty much. I mean, honestly, anything to get out of London. To come here? Really? Yeah. I have a lot of family in London. And let's just say distance makes the heart grow fonder. I'm bit of a black sheep in my family. A black sheep nurse? GEN: Well, I think my only saving grace is that I am a nurse. Everything else, not so much. -Oh. Whoa. -GEN: What? Twitter is blowing up. They just finished the emergency deliberation. Really? Yeah. "Unprecedented trial has reached a verdict, ending in a whirlwind deliberation." Oh, my God. My God, does it say when they'll announce? Oh, shit! They're announcing the verdict in about an hour. The jury will appear soon? Are you shitting me? It's just like-- Yo, Cal, come on. You're holding my balls here. -Okay. -Yo, Miles, quit cheating. Pull that cup. Could've actually death cupped him. Yeah. But I wanna see his face when we beat him straight up. -Yeah. -All right, come on, rice boy. You're holding me back. Oh, hey, relax, crybaby. All right? Ooh! Nice shot. Here we go. Oh. -Yes! -Come on, ball's back! RISH & CAL: Ball's back! -Muel, you gotta start making some more! -What do you want me to do? What? No, shit. I'm trying. All right. All right, here we go. And... MILES: Oh! But that's, like, so crazy. MILES: How you doin', baby? -Everything's great, hon. Thanks for askin'. -[chuckles] I'm good, babe. You good? MILES: Yeah, yeah. I'm great. Just celebratin'. Oh. Uh, congrats on the wedding. VERONICA: Oh, thank you. CAL: Miles, your shot! Um, baby, I'm just gonna step outside real quick for some air. -MILES: Okay. Do you need me to come with you? -Oh, no, no. I'm fine. -MILES: Okay. -Go have fun. -Okay. -Okay. Okay. Shannon, I will be right back. And I'll keep helping. Oh, girl, take your time! [chuckles] Nice. So, how are things at work, man? Killing that marketing game, huh? Just watch this. It's fine. I heard from Vin about the promotion. That's... that's awesome, dude. Like, do you have, uh-- Hey, we ain't gotta do this, man. Okay. Well, what do you mean, like... Just play the game, man. I mean, I'm happy for you, dude. And Gen she seems like such a really cool girl. Let's just play the game, all right? We're almost done. SAMUEL & MILES (TOGETHER): Oh! -SAMUEL: Whoo! -MILES: That's two! -Yeah! -Yes! -SAMUEL: Oh! -That's... that's my bad, dude. It's my bad. [Miles grunting] [Samuel grunting] Crackers win this round. Finally. [grunts] Okay. So, what does that mean? KAYLA: They're calling in Devonoff and Carina right now. So, that means we're gonna find out the verdict tonight. KAYLA: Yeah. Does that happen often, late night verdicts? Special circumstances, the judge called for it. It's crazy. -Baby, what number is that? -Oh! [blows raspberry] I'm fine. Give me a kiss. [smooches] GEN: So, what do you think they'll say? I mean... I mean, he's guilty, right? IZZY: Well, the evidence is pretty clear. Oh, we'll see if it holds up in court. [chuckles] Uh, but really, it's about the court of public opinion nowadays. Right? Sorry, not to butt in. And let me say, I agree with all of you. He's 100 percent guilty. But the way we used to view public opinion compared to the way we view it now, it's very different. And that doesn't make his actions any less okay. But the way society accepted those actions back then was also very different. So, is it fair to compare them? So, just because things were more accepted then, does that mean that we're not supposed to hold people accountable now? Would you hold yourself to that standard? VINNY: Of course, not. But it's the way that we were educated. It's the way that we were brought up. I mean, I consider myself a decent guy. Well, there are way too many people out there who aren't decent people, and I think it's time that we all get a healthy dose of wokeness on decency. And this is why I steer clear of convos like this. You ladies got this, right? I'm going to excuse myself from any further potential mansplaining. [chuckles] Love you, baby. IZZY: I'm sorry. I just get hell of a heated on these things. KAYLA: But I don't know. I don't think it's that easy. It's still, like, a he said, she said sort of thing. And he's one of the most prominent doctors in the nation. Mm-hmm. I read his dissertation ten times. He's brilliant. And also White. Exactly. What's that got to do? KAYLA: I mean, I'm sure you realize there's a bit of a pattern here. Powerful men have always dictated the tides in their favor, yes. And things are changing now. So, this is one of our tests. You know what I'm saying? KAYLA: Yeah, I mean, look. All of us strong women here, we are Carina Williams. Her voice matters. I mean, we can't be surprised if it goes the other way. You think it's-- -SHANNON: I mean, I'm just saying it wouldn't be... like, out of the ordinary if he wasn't found guilty. You know, I read that she repeatedly wrote him romantically, too. And didn't it happen over 30 years ago? We're all entitled some presumption of innocence in this country. Was it also full-on rape? No. It was more like assault, like, he forced himself on her. But does that make a difference? -Mm. -All I'm saying is that people do a lot of stupid things in their lives, or could be riding a trend. I mean, of course, I still believe her. All women should be believed. Right? I have to break the seal. BRB. Excuse me, ladies. We're downing these light beers a little faster than anticipated. Just don't puke again. I'm not cleaning up after you. SAMUEL: Yeah. [laughing mockingly] Two times that happened. KAYLA: Okay. [splutters] KAYLA: And you're headed for a hat-rick. [chuckles] And Kayla with the assist. [chuckles] Ya'll are cute together! -Oh, thanks. -We are not together. Oh. Go win your game. [chuckles] SAMUEL: I got it, okay? Just enjoy yourself. KAYLA: Are you trying to tell me what to do? SAMUEL: No. I just want you to have a good time. You having fun getting to know everyone? Almost everyone. Oh, no. Who's it this time? I'm just kidding. Honestly, your friends are great. Seriously. Okay, good. Good. 'Cause, you know, these guys are my brothers, and I'm just really happy you get to meet them. Or they get to meet you tonight. 'Cause it's a perfect opportunity to... To what? To meet them. Okay. You're being weird. You're being weird. Dude, you're being weird. Can you stop spooning my beers and put them down? Oh, yeah. I'm... [scoffs] I'm sorry. Dude, uh, was she the one that you were talking about? -Yeah. -She's cute. -Yeah. -Are you gonna make a move? -No. -All right! Sudden death. -MILES: Hey! -SAMUEL: Oh! CAL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Brilliant. -No, wait, say that again. Brilliant. Brilliant. There you go. Wait, really? No, that was awful. I need a smoke. Mm. No, please don't. They'll kill you. I just say it because I'm supposed to say that. Mm. Well, if it's any consolation, I totally meant something more medicinal. Mm. Like what? Oh! Isn't it legal now? Why? Do you wanna partake? [inhales sharply] Can't. Drug tests. Well, it's all CBD. No THC. -GEN: Hmm. -Undetectable. Mm. Sounds enticing. I probably won't partake. But I'll join you outside for some fresh air. Cool. [indistinct chatter] Hey, there, stranger. Hey. What are you guys doing over there? You okay? Just fine. Just drinking. Talking with the girls. Are you looking for your lighter? No. Oh, it's okay. Here. I got it. It's fine. Okay? If you wanna smoke, you can go smoke if you want to. Okay? We're not smoking cigarettes. Oh. You're smoking weed? Not the actual plant. No. -Is that okay for your tests? -Yes. But I'm probably not-- I didn't even know you couldn't read it. Can you just stop? What? I'm just asking. Let's not do this here. Okay? Be back. What? SAMUEL: Cal, get over, dude. CAL: Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God! I didn't see you. Hey, it's okay. It happens often. [chuckles] Okay. Well, I'll see you back-- Hey. Uh, did you mean what you said earlier? -What? -You know, how you wouldn't be surprised if he got off and stuff. Who got off? What bedroom? [chuckles] No, no, no, no. The case. Devonoff? Oh. Uh... [scoffs] Um... I don't know. I just feel like most people these days don't really care about what the truth really is. They'll just, um... find a reason to blame someone, and... move on. [indistinct yelling in distance] Hey, Shannon. Hmm. IZZY: Did anyone here at this party... do something to you before? Yes. Was it Miles? -Does Vinny know? -No! -Wow. -And he's not going to. -Really? -[sniffles, sobs] I don't know. Well, are you okay with him being here and stuff? [sighs] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I... I'm fine. I mean, the night will be over before you know it. Sure, I guess. And they haven't seen each other in years. I mean, how could... why would I take that away from them? (♪♪♪) Does anybody else know? (♪♪♪) [Gen chuckling] TAYLOR: Ladies. GEN: So listen, I couldn't do a thing. [both chuckles] I don't know why we didn't just go to the backyard. That's, like, a fail on our parts. Yeah. Well, it bugs Rish seeing me with anyone -who smokes, so... -Sounds controlling. Is he a square? A square? It's like an outdated term for straight-edge. Like, really, really outdated. I'm actually kinda judging myself for using that as an example. It's okay. [both laughs] It's just that I've quit smoking cigarettes multiple times. He just assumes that I haven't. That's shitty. Well, no cigarettes here, so you're good. [Gen chuckles] Uh, cigarette? [chuckles nervously] -SAMUEL: All right. Say your prayers. -You ain't got this. SAMUEL: Say your prayers. -I'm just giving you-- I'm givin' you a-- -Oh, it's just- Hey, I'm- -SAMUEL: Say your prayers. -You ain't got it, man. -I totally got this. -You ain't got it, man. -Nah, no way! Heard there was a party here. CAL: Holy shit! [all cheer] [chuckles] Oh, fuck, Taylor! RISH: Oh, you made it, man! I heard it was a one-night only event. Wouldn't gotta miss the boys. CAL: How the fuck was Dubai? Oh, it was sick, man! I'm gonna show you photos later. I'll bet. I'll bet. Your posts are always so sick, man. -[chuckles] -Did you just get in? -TAYLOR: Yeah. -Always with a new Insta post and a new Insta model. -SAMUEL: Yeah. -VINNY: Mm-hmm. Yeah, bro. How much do you pay for those girls? What? -[laughs] -TAYLOR: What are you... what are you talking about? Come on, get over here! Stop standing in that corner all alone. Come here. [grunts] A little pong, huh? Oh, Vin, the house, the aesthetic. As soon as I walked in the front door, I could feel the energy. I could feel the vibe. Oh, Tay, yo. Celebrity shot, man. -TAYLOR: Oh! -Come on! -CAL: Let's go, come on. -[Samuel chuckles] TAYLOR: All right. [clicks tongue] ALL (TOGETHER): Oh! Yeah! I'm glad you made it. I'm so glad you made it. -Hey, babe? -VINNY: Baby! Great timing. Look who made it! -What? -Tay made it! SHANNON: Wow. Look who decided to show up. Oh. You know I always crash these guys' parties. It's a ritual more than anything else. Food's ready. You wanna round them all up? -VINNY: Got it. -CAL: Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. You know how to time it, man. [laughs] God! CAL: Right. I'm so hungry. -IZZY: Hey. -Hey. Oh! -IZZY: Can I talk to you for a second? -Yeah, yeah. Hey. This was Taylor. You remember I was telling you? IZZY: Hi, Taylor. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. TAYLOR: Yeah, pleasure. You are gorgeous. Jesus. No offense, Cal. What? Why am I offended? I totally agree. [chuckles] Thanks. Cal. Oh, hey. I'll be right back. Go do your thing. What's up? Did you know? -Know what? -About Shannon? -I'm not following you. -About her fucking assult. -What? -Why didn't you tell me? -Wait, wait. Hold on. -The whole time he was here, and you didn't say anything to me? Come here. (♪♪♪) How did you-- who told you this? -Fucking Shannon. -Okay. But how did this even come up? I'm sorry. It doesn't take a genius to sense when a woman is uncomfortable. -How did you find out? -Because I fucking pried. Okay? -How have you not told Vinny about this? -Izzy-- Really? Over ten years, and you haven't said anything? -You weren't even there. -With everything that is happening. With everything that I've been through. CAL: Calm-- listen, you gotta calm down. She literally looked at you when it was happening, Cal. And what did you do? Really, with all the things that you preach and talk about when it comes to me, and you really couldn't tell off -that priviliged fuck? Stop, -Izzy. Don't... don't talk about something you don't know. Okay? Why? 'Cause he's your childhood friend? Because he's your bro? Huh? You're drunk. I'm not doing this with you right now. Is that why you told Rish about his cheating ex? You felt guilty not speaking out for Shannon? So, y'all just fell out when in reality, he was just a shitty ass boyfriend? SAMUEL (MOUTHING): Food. IZZY: I'm sorry. [sniffles] I'm sorry. I crossed a line. Let's go back inside, okay? Okay? Are you gonna tell him? Come on. Come on. [Izzy sniffles] It's okay. Come on. 'Cause if you don't... Come on. Come on. -[Izzy sniffles] -[chuckles] VICTORIA: I cannot belive it. Thank you. And do you mind if we just keep this between us girls? -Of course. -Of course, yeah. Okay. [chuckles] This isn't my phone. Oh, no. That was so close. [all chuckles] He's pretty slow. [laughs] -I know! Every time. -[chuckles] (♪♪♪) [indistinct chatter] CAL: Yeah, we're good. We're covered. [indistinct chatter] [Miles whistling] CAL: You freashin' it up, Taylor? TAYLOR: Oh, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. SHANNON: [speaks indistinctly] Okay, is everyone here? Wait. Hold on, Chang! -Oh! -RISH: Oh! Hey, come on. Shut up. RISH: Were you going number two in there? Hey. Do you know how much bacteria gets in your cuticles, man? Come on. -No. -VERONICA: True. -[chuckles] -VINNY: It's nasty. Hey, baby. That's true, babe. That's very true. [kisses] Yeah. [sniffs] Hmm. [chuckles] What? [speaks indistinctly] [giggles] -Hmm. -Did you smoke a cigarette? KAYLA: Yeah, I needed a little head high. Oh, didn't know you had any. -[clears throat] -Yeah. Didn't smoke the one I had at the bar last night. So, whoo, progress. Okay. So, um, babe, do you wanna say anything? Uh, sure. Um, everyone, enjoy the food. -I'm glad you guys are all here. -[chuckles] And if you don't enjoy the food, just lie. -[all laughs] -Okay. Hey. Um, if you guys don't mind, I wouldn't mind saying a few words if that's okay with our gracious hosts here. I'm not trying to steal anybody's thunder. I promise. Go for it. SHANNON: Yes, please, speech. Look. I... I didn't-- I mean, it's crazy. I know I just got here. But I am just so humbled by these moments, 'cause these types of things don't happen everywhere. And trust me, I've been pretty much everywhere. -[chuckles] -[Rush chuckling] Mm-hmm. TAYLOR: And it's crazy. Today, I was on this flight. I'm sitting next to this older woman. She was a real gem. Like, old money. And she starts telling me-- well, she starts preaching to me that she'll never understand the ways of the world now with... with these, and how she wishes everything would go back to the way they were. And we're all losing touch in some sort of way, 'cause we're all looking down. But me... I'm lookin' up at all you boys here. The same boys who took in this dumb kid every time I'd run away. The same boys that would rally to that sunrise shot. [chuckles] CAL: That's right. That's right. And the same men... who stood next to my side when my mother was sick. You guys were my rocks. [chuckles] I'm sorry, ladies, if I might be in love with your guys a little more than you are. [all chuckles] But really, you... you guys are the best men I've ever known. And if it weren't for moments like this... [sighs] ...I probably wouldn't be crushing so hard right now. [chuckles] TAYLOR: With that being said... fuck the old, and let's bring in the new. -VINNY: Hey! Hey! -Okay. All right. CAL, VINNY & GEN: Cheers. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] Okay. As much as I enjoyed that speech, I am starved. Dig in, everybody. Let's do it. And don't forget about these babies right here. -CAL: Dumplings. -MILES: Whoo! -GEN: All right. -Get the dumplings. [laughs] -GEN: Yeah, I'll serve this. -RISH: Tikki, tikki, tikki. -[laughs] -[indistinct chatter] -Whoa! -And that's their tallest skyscraper. Wow. Just dangling off the damn roof. No big deal. [chuckles] Yeah. They let me stay in this villa for free -with these shots. -Are you kidding? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, yo, dude. I did a sponsored pic once. I mean, not as that big obviously. -Local donut place. -Oh, that's cool, dude. -Thanks. -Good for you. -Yeah. -Cool. Hey, you know what? Here. Here, take that. -What? -Yeah. Really? -Dude, they gave them to me, I got, like, 50 of those. Dude, you're serious. Thanks! Taylor, that's awesome! -No worries, dude. -Did you take one of these with that? Oh, whoa! My bad. -[laughs] -KAYLA: What? -[coughs] Sorry, man. -What? Nothing. There was- he had a naked chick on his phone. No! [chuckles] Wait, what? Like, as a screen saver? No. No, no, no, no, no. It's a friend of mine. My friend Shiran. She's, like-- she-- sometimes, she poses as a nude model. She loves to, like, put the photos up in her house, and treats it like her own little gallery. -Oh. -I'm sorry, what? Oh, really? -[laughs] -[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. It's a form of art, really. I mean, beautiful pieces, too. Italy is gorgeous. Mm. Does she put them around her own home? Like trophies. [laughs] Like, she has, like... like, no undies on? Clean as a whistle. -[whistles] -Oh. Oh. And, uh, so, is she... is she married? TAYLOR: Yeah. Uh, Rafael. He's one of the best chefs in Milan. He has another little restaurant in Portofino. Huh. [chuckles] What's, uh... what's his opinion about them? Mm. Like what? Like, he's okay with these photos just out there for anyone to see? [chuckles] They... that's sort of the point. Right? Thank you! -[Shannon chuckling] -[chuckles] Wait, why? [Gen chuckling] -Well... funny enough... -[chuckles] Babe. What? It's fine f or the dinner table. I've actually taken some photos myself. Something of the tasteful sort. -TAYLOR: Mm-hmm. -So, you do model. Well, in that situation. And, um, last week, uh, actually, it's similar to your friend over there. And we had some friends over, and, um, Rish here actually... [chuckles] KAYLA: He what? He hid them. [chuckles] CAL: Whoa! What? -[Gen chuckling] -TAYLOR: What? Really? SHANNON: Wait. Why would you hide them? What, like, do you wanna be private or something? Well, yeah. Of course, I wanna be private about it. I mean, it's my girlfriend's body. I don't know every person that comes into our home. And I don't trust them enough to just have these photos lying around for anyone to see 'em. I mean, they could take a photo of it, and then upload it. I mean, sure. Right. Yeah, sure. But... but it's also her body. [chuckles] Thank you. Uh sure, yeah. Right. And-- but what happens if your parents find out? And what are they gonna think about it? Why do you care what her family thinks? Yeah, I'm sorry. I wouldn't want anyone looking at my baby's body like that. Well, we weren't talking about you, so... VERONICA: Oh, no, no, no. He's right, too. I mean, I wouldn't have the confidence to do something so risqué, but seriously, kudos to you. So, you think it's okay that he can tell you what you can do with your body? I don't... I don't feel like he's telling me what to do with my body. I... I'm just saying that we are on the same page. That's all. And people love differently. What about you, Cal? Would you take down nude photos of me for guests? I was just gonna say these are really good dumplings, Vinny. -[chuckles] -[Gen chuckling] -SAMUEL: Yeah, yeah. -I mean, l'm sorry. But look, if the medical board caught wind of this, I mean, you'd be done. Okay. But she's entitled to the choices that she makes for her own body regardless of what any job or person would think. Yeah. But I'm pretty sure she also doesn't wanna be homeless. Okay. But are you also speaking for her? -Hey, Kayla. -No-- No. No. I can speak for myself. I'm just gonna put this away here, okay? And the way we see physical bodies are different than outside the U.S. It's much-- Thank you. Yes. It is so different. Over there, it's just, like, free the nipple, you know? That's the eloquent way to put it. -VINNY: Mm-hmm. -I suppose. To be totally eloquently fair, I think it's totally inappropriate to be talking about my girlfriend's body at the fucking dinner table! [chuckles awkwardly, laughs] What's so funny, dude? This exact conversation is just hilarious. [clears throat] What's so hilarious, Mile high? [clears throat] This. I mean, this talk. I mean, like, when did it become a situation for us to talk about human body parts? Like, when was it an issue for me to be able to be like, "Oh, hey, you know, I care about my baby, and I wanna protect her from, like, fucked-up dudes out there"? To now, it's like, if I express myself, I'm a misogynistic mansplainer? What? So, you don't realize that it's not your decision to make? [scoffs] Who's to say it isn't? KAYLA: Are you serious? MILES: All right, look. My baby knows that I can't have sugar past 8:00 p.m. Okay? And she knows that I love my late-night snacks. She also knows that I will find them. So, she makes the decision to hide them from me. So, you're saying we as partners can't make decisions based on what we know about each other, what we know would be better for each other? -What kinda snacks? -Now, hold up. Are you actually linking feminism to munches right now? -Flaming Cheetos and Gummy bears. -Mm. -Ah, classics. -TAYLOR: Nice. -[kisses] -[Gen chuckling] -They are. -MILES: And, no, Cal. That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that men and women, you know, we have a different experience than they have, and they have a different experience than we have. So, we should just respect each other for it. It's not a big deal. I mean, Vinny, you agreed with me on this. Remember? Uh, no. MILES: What? Dude, that's bullshit! You just said that the other day, that you feel like women are exploiting the shit out of us. -What? -Uh... Oh, you're taking my words way out of context. What I said is that we were so used to one side of the spectrum, and now, that that is changing, we haven't found the right balance yet. Everything's just black and white instead of circumstantial. Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. SAMUEL: I get what you're saying. Like, you're trying-- you're saying, how do we as guys circumstantially know what's the difference, what's okay and what's not okay, right? Like I never wanna make anyone feel like I'm harassing them, but at the same time, if I'm into them, I don't know, I just freak out. One time, I asked a girl if I could kiss her, and you know what she said? "Never ask." [chuckles] You just have to read the room. -KAYLA: Yeah. -IZZY:And we do give out signs. Plenty. Mm-hmm. MILES: What signs? -Ah, we give signs. -[clicks tongue] -You? You've never given a sign. -That is not true. I give you the little, like, head smile and a little... Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. That was a sign. -Yeah, that was a sign. -[smooches] [chuckles] Sometimes, man, you just gotta take a chance, you know? Like, you're not gonna know if you're on the same page or not, but you just gotta be confidently vulnerable that you're gonna take a leap. Oh, and eye contact. -IZZY: Mm. -Yeah. -IZZY: Eye contact is very flexible. -GEN: Hmm. Yeah. -KAYLA: Mm-hmm. -There a lotta googly eyes happening here. TAYLOR: Cal the poet. [Izzy chuckling] Mm. He gotta have his way with words with you, too, doesn't he? Tell me... what is it that you do? I'm a musician. -Mm-hmm. -Hmm. Of cours, you are. That's awesome. Well, I'm in music, too. -What kinda music? -Actually, for TV and film. -VINNY: Oh, so, like composition. -IZZYY: Yeah. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. She got scooped up right after school, and she's been hijacking your airpods with eerie music ever since. -TAYLOR: Huh. -Very cool. Very cool. Are there a lot of African-American women in that field? -What do you mean? -[Gen clearing throat] I just meant, like, is it challenging being an African-American woman in the industry? I like to think that it's challenging being a woman in any industry. It doesn't really matter if you're Black. I'm... I'm sorry. I... is it not okay to say African-American? [clears throat] Can't say that anymore now either. [laughs] Um, it just depends. I mean, you can say Black. There's nothing wrong with that. VINNY: Really? I mean, I had a floormate in college, and he told me that you couldn't say that. He was Black. I mean, African-American. Wait, wait, wait. So, how it racist for me to say that it-- how is it racist if I say that Cal is yellow, but not if Rish is brown. It's racist because you never actually had to experience living like the other. You don't know what it means to say yellow. And you're also coming from a place of power simply because of your precedent in this country. SAMUEL: But that's not what we're saying at all. I mean, it's not my intention. Like, isn't it racist then if you call me a cracker? Or like when Rish calls me white boy. -RISH: White bread. -[chuckles] Only the people with power can be the racists, not the other way around. Wait. That's total bullshit. That's not my intention. It's not about intentions, dude. It's just ignorant. It's ignorant just because you're not aware of the fact that you've never had to experience it. So, all those little circumstantial things that you're bringin' up are actual circumstances -that we as people of color had to go through. -[sighs] Yeah, man. Yeah, dude-- yeah. Shit that we get ridiculed over, we get beaten over, got killed over. Sit down, man. You don't know what you're talking about. Long story short... that's wonderful. Very happy for you. -Thank you. -TAYLOR: Mm-hmm. So, what is it that you do? You're a photographer? You could say that? IZZY: Hmm. I'm asking you what you say. -TAYLOR: Mm. -More wine? -TAYLOR: Uh-- -Please. -Yeah. -I'd say I'm a lifestyle enthusiast. -As an... -Influencer. -Ah. -Mm-hmm. Well, I guess that another... way you could call it. I give people around the world a glimpse into what it's like to live life at its fullest potential. It's a very privileged job, of course. Oh? Well, I'm glad we got privilege included. Absolutely. What, do you think I don't know my own privilege? Of course, I do. I own it. It's the only way I can do good for other people. So, I mean, it's not my fault. I forgo the opportunities, what you guys have. A close settlement, being able to see your friends and family whenever you want. I gave all that up to travel around the world, so I can give people who are underprivileged a glimpse into what it's like through my lens. [Kayla chuckles] I'm pretty sure owning and utilizing your white privilege would mean to help firsthand the issues happening here rather than, I don't know, traversing the world. But what do I know? I design websites. [Vinny clearing throat] Is anyone gonna finish these dumplings? TAYLOR: Okay, look. If you wanna get into it, about real-world problems, I could-- -KAYLA: Please. -Yeah, hold on. I gotta-- one sec. Sorry, guys. I gotta take this. It's my flight. [grunts] TAYLOR: Yep. Yeah. Well, Taylor hasn't changed much at all. Yeah, whatever. He's too good for us. Oh, come on, dude. No, he's not. [scoffs] The man is wearing a 400-dollar pajama sweater. It's 70 degrees outside. Come on. I don't know. I think he's kinda cool. Yeah. You definitely would, Muel. -VINNY: Hey, Miles. Come on, man. -What? You want another beer or... Dude, I'm fine. It's whatever. Fuck it. -KAYLA: Oh, fuck. -What? GEN: What happened? Um, Vinny, can we turn up the TV? TV, unmute. -[protestors clamoring on TV] -TV REPORTER: ...And the courtroom was palpable. There are many outside, just standing in shock. And we can only assume that social media will have an overwhelming response. Once again, we are breaking the news here on Devenoff-Williams trial, and the result of the deliberation. The verdict is not guilty. Again, for our viewers at home, that is Mike Devonoff has been found not guilty on all counts. As Devonoff and the defense team celebrate their victory, prosecutors are outraged that what they view as social injustice, they have... [scoffs] That's so fucking ridiculous! You guys believe this shit? GEN: So, he just got off? No nothing? SAMUEL: This is unbelievable. Just basically a slap on the wrist. KAYLA: No jail time. -IZZY: No. -KAYLA: So fucking stupid. I mean, who cares? His life is ruined anyway. What, it's not like anyone's gonna get treated by him. I mean, it's never gonna go back to normal. Online trolls are gonna drag him through the Internet mud. And you think justice is served? [scoffs] I wouldn't say it's justice, but it's something. Hey, you ruined his life. Congratulations. This stuff is pretty rampant around the world. I'm surprised it even got this much attention. I mean, all y'all just wanna, like, go back into everyone's life, and dig up any dirt that you can. It's like, we all fucked up in the past. We-- okay? We were all horny fucks. It doesn't mean that we-- like, you need to put us in the same category as, like, rape. Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, let's go get a smoke outside. No. I mean, I'm just-- Spoken like a true white privileged nationalist. -Hey, that's not fair. -MILES: What? Says Miss White Savior over there. Are you fucking kidding me? I don't impose my whiteness on anybody. I'm the least racist person here. Back me up on that, Rish. You're telling me that if that doctor on TV was Black or POC, that it'd be the same verdict? Yeah. So ignorant. It's not ignorant. It's just truth. RISH: It's not about racism, Miles. It's just... look, you're in a position to lack empathy solely because you have never been in the position to need it. [laughs] What? Are you fucking kidding me, dude? It sucks to be a white guy right now. Back me up on this, Vinny. Hey, hey. Leave me out of this, man. It d-- no! Let me just say this. Oh, I think you just said enough. Oh. Well, so says Cal, putting the foot down now that he's in production! Fuck did you just say to me? Yeah! Dude, all I'm saying is that people change. So, why don't you go in the corner and cry about being wanted. Is that what you think, Miles? You think women should go cry in the corner after being assaulted by men? Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't think he was talking about, like, women specifically. Izzy. You know what? You're right. This is not my place. KAYLA: No. Hold on. Wait. What were you gonna say? Yeah. Come on. What were you gonna say? Just say it. Babe, are you okay? SHANNON: Mm-hmm. Come on, we're all family here. Just say it. What, you're gonna dog me in front of my friends like that? just say it! -Miles. -Dude, relax. Oh, don't tell me to relax! Come on, just say it. -Say it! -CAL: You assaulted Shannon! What? -What that-- -Miles. What is he talking about? No, I-- [scoffs] No, I... I mean, I don't know what he's talking about. I would never. He doesn't know what he's talking about. I would never do that. Klapman's party, 12 years ago. Senior year. -VINNY: What? -MILES: No, no, no. I never, uh... No, no. You know what? She... she... she came onto me that night. She did. I remember that. IZZY: And she also said, "No." Or did you choose not to hear that part? God, what is this? Some kinda fucking ambush or something? If this is some kinda intervention, I'm-- Dude, I'm getting the fuck outta here. Baby, come on. Let's go. Hey, hey. You're not going anywhere. No, no, no, no, no. No one is going anywhere until we figure this out right now. Okay? Miles, I've known you my entire life. You better come clean, or I swear to God, I might do something that I'll regret. [scoffs] Okay. Come on, Whiskey. Just relax. VINNY: Hey, hey, hey! Do not tell me to relax in my own home! Dude! Tell me what you did! Dude, we fooled around. That's it. All right, we fooled around. She showed me signs. Signs that she wasn't gonna stop. Hey, Chang! Shannon, come on, back me up on this. You know that I would never come onto you like that. I've never put myself on you. But you did. Says who? I saw it. I didn't mean to, you know? I just... I stumbled on that hallway, and you were kissing her neck. She pushed you away just as she saw me, and... I didn't know if I was supposed to do anything then. I wasn't... aware that I was supposed to say something to you then, Shannon. Was I supposed to? 'Cause I always wished I did. I'm sorry, Shannon. I... [sobs softly] Baby, is this true? MILES: No! I... Look, I was plastered, and fuckin' she was plastered. We were drunk, and-- Fucking typical. Blame it on the girl. And the booze. MILES: I'm not blaming it on her or the fuckin' booze! Okay, Kayla, please. Miles has been nothing but a gentleman since the day he met me. And he treats my mother with so much respect. IZZY: I'm sorry. But does that justify his past actions? No! No. Of course, not. No, but... I know him. And I know that would never force himself on someone like that. Why would you defend him? Because he's my fiancé. And I will stand by him, and be his champion until the day I die. So, look. I respect all of you women here. I do. But right now, you are talking about my husband. And he assaulted my girlfriend's body. SHANNON: Vinny, stop. I let it happen. Babe, no. No, you-- No, we were both drunk. And... [sniffles] ...I've always wondered if it was me. If I did something wrong. And I said, "Stop," but I didn't say it hard enough. It is not your fault. It was never rape. He just... Broke your trust for anyone who came after him? MILES: Look. I'm sorry for whatever happened that night. But I swear on my future child that that is not how I saw it. All right? It's just with all this "me, too" shit, it's like we can't even teach our children the difference between a man and a woman. It's like we all have to be the same now or something. -Let's get some air. -It's fucking ridiculous! Let's get some air, okay? Dude-- whatever, bro. Baby? Baby? Are you okay? Listen, fuck Miles. I'll never talk to him again, okay? I got him his job. I practically handed him his fucking life that he loves. Stop! Just stop. I don't need any of that. Okay? I don't need you to do anything for me. You always wanna find a fucking solution, and sometimes, I just need you to sit with my shit! He's your friend. [sobs] SHANNON: And I made this choice not to say anything. Okay? So, there was a time when than... [sniffles] ...might've affected me. But it doesn't anymore. Okay? It doesn't define me in any way anymore. And I don't need anybody here to feel bad for me, okay? Hey. Just let her breathe, man. SAMUEL: Miles, stop! Miles, stop, man! Come on. Where are you going? Miles, stop, man. Wait. Dude, you've been drinking. Where are you gonna go? Just stop! Get the fuck outta here, Muel! I'm the white guy, removing himself from the situation. And if you touch me again, I will break your fucking neck! SAMUEL: What happened to you, man? Go be a slave to someone else. SAMUEL: Yeah. Maybe that person won't scare so easy. And my name is fucking Samuel by the way. Maybe you ought to start figuring out who the hell you are in this world? Off again, huh? Yeah, man. Sorry, I... I gotta go where the work is, you know? Let the boys know for me, will ya? Sounded like they needed to air out some laundry in there. Yeah. And you're just gonna take off like it never even happened? Did you know about Miles and Shannon? At Klapman's party? About what he did to her? [scoffs] Is there any part of you that isn't entirely full of shit? I love you guys. But this? This the type of shit that I don't need. I don't need feelings. I already know what it's like to lose the most important person to me. What, are you gonna put yourself through that again? There's so much to look forward to in the future. Come on. What, are you gonna stay here and dwell in the past? So, basically, just run from everything. The whole world's still gonna be chasing me. And you know what? You're still gonna wanna be just like me. Hey. Hey, Taylor. Got an extra seat. Future always forgives. Runnin' ain't forgivin'. [sniffles] [Taylor sighs] [sighs] So, I imagine that's not what you were expecting for a dinner party. Mm. A little more colorful than usual. [chuckles] Right. Hey, uh, I don't know if it's my place to say, but... considering everything that's happened tonight, I feel like nothing is off limits at this point. But, uh, I'm so happy to see you and Rish together. Him and I really haven't seen eye to eye in a bit. -I know. -[sighs] I think I'm realizing more today that just communicating and not letting things fester from something into something you just can't even recognize anymore is healthy, so... But I know Rish, and... like, he looks at you. He really looks at you. I don't think I'm making any sense. [chuckles softly, sighs] Thank you, Cal. And I sense that he misses you, too. Deeply. -Go do your thing. Yeah. -Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Um, I just checked on Shannon. She just needs some space. Okay. And I think I do, too. (♪♪♪) -Okay. -IZZY: I just called a Lyft, so... All right. Well, let me get my things. I'll go with you. No. Stay. You need to be with him. No, fuck that. I'll come with you. Yeah. Stay. Are we okay? I don't know, Cal. You lied to me. And about something like this, I... I can't process this and be here at the same time. I can't be with you in this space at the same time. We'll be okay. It's okay. -[kisses] -Tell me we'll be okay. Hey, is, uh, Shannon here? Uh, bedroom I think. (♪♪♪) SHANNON: So, when I went down to the bathroom, um... just a little further away from all the noise, all the... -[sniffles] -SHANNON: ...tequila and weed, all... mixed up. And when he came down, too, I-- MILES: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't-- I'm sorry to interrupt. I'll come back. No, Miles. Come in. It's okay. I want him to hear this. Only if it's okay with you. SHANNON: So, when he... when you... came downstairs to the bathroom... [sniffles] SHANNON: ...and I came out into that... tiny, narrow hallway, and you blocked my way up. You said... Do you remember what you said? You said... "You can't tease me like that all night and get away with it." And when you... when you kissed me, I didn't stop you. I know that. [sobs] But when I tried to get around you... me, this... tiny, little Asian girl, you wouldn't let me. [breathes shakily] And when you pinned me against the wall... and dug your hand in my pants... just as Cal came downstairs, I... -[sniffles] -...I shut down. The voice screaming in my head became a whisper in the dark. I wanted to be the cool girl so bad. -[sniffles] -You know, the girl that all the other douchebag jocks wanted. I didn't want Cal or anyone else to see me unwanted, but really... I was so much more scared of what you would do if my voice was louder. So, I let you keep going until... You convinced me to go in the bathroom. And then I left. Leaving all that bullshit behind. Until today. It... it was wrong of me to do it. And it was wrong of me to minimize it. I'm so sorry, Shannon. Thank you, Miles. Can you forgive me? No. I understand. [exhales shakily] [sniffles] (♪♪♪) [Miles sighs] Baby. I'll get better, I promise. I smoked a cigarette today. [kisses] Hey, stranger. Hi. [both sighs] So... those are my childhood friends. Obviously, we won't be hanging out with them ever again. [both chuckles] Well, it beats those boring dinner parties where all there is is small talk. Those are awful. And, hey. You know what? [sighs] I want you to do whatever you wanna do with your body. I mean, I'm not endorsing that you go out and become, like, a sex worker or something, but there would be nothing wrong with that. I mean, uh, it's a fine job. This is a really, really great apology. [chuckles] I want you to be you. I like Cal. Must've been hard for him to hold that secret for so long. It's probably why he holds his friends in such high esteem. Well, Miles is hardly to be held in high esteem, so... [chuckles] Well, I wasn't talking about him. [inhales, exhales] Really? [chuckles] I won't tell if you won't. [both chuckles] [smooches] Thank you. [kisses] Where's Izzy? Uh, she left. Is she okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's just-- she's tired. How about you? I don't know. Same. How is she? She's strong. She'll be better. Hey, let me get this. Are you trying to tell me what to do? Stop, come on. Listen, you're my guest. They're my friends. We just had an existential millennial meltdown. You've gotta be exhausted. Let me get this for you, okay? Obviously, you can help. It's not my place to say otherwise, but you did a lot of good tonight, so let me get this. Okay. Have at it. We'll just consider it even for that time you puked. [chuckles] [clears throat] [sighs] Hey, Cal. Look, um, I'm sorry I-- Just do the dishes, man. We're almost done. [chuckles softly] We'll light one up and talk after, right, Vin? [chuckles softly] [music ends] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
