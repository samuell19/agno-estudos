Until we getback on our feet. - I don't understand.How could this have happened? - Oh, it's happenedto a lot of people. We'll pull through. We'll talkmore tonight, okay? Oh, and Martha, until further notice, please do your own nails. - I wonder if we're gonna geta white Christmas this year. - Hope not.- How come? - I mean, why wastea perfectly good snow day when we're goingto be off school anyway?

Who wantsto help me do some baking? - I do. - How aboutyou, George? - Uh I'm feelinga little tired.

Well no, I triedto object, Gwen, but Martha can't tellme what to paint on my own sign.Well I'm just about... I'm gonna call you back later. Hello, Martha. Coffee? - Actually, that'snot why I'm here. - Martha, I toldyou I just can't afford to repaint my sign.- Whatever you think best. - Okay. Then whatcan I do for you? - Betty, I've decidedto take a more... hands-on approachto helping our community. - How do you mean? - Well, I thought I couldstart right here. Perhaps as a hostess welcomingpeople as they enter? - Are you askingme for a job? - In a manner of speaking. I simply thought that withthe holidays you might usea little assistance. - You know, I mighthave an opening. Why don't you just let me talkto Marty in the kitchen. - In the kitchen? Oh, no, no, no, no. I thought somethingperhaps that would showcase my people skills, such as a hostess! Ugh. - Leon Deeks was aboutto rob that cash register... until my wife threwher hip into it. - Martha stopped a robberywith her hips? - I hope you're not joking, Deputy, because thisis no laughing matter. - Uh, I'm aware that Leon Deeks is backin Middleton, Mayor Tinsdale.- What are you doing about it? - First of all, we're goingto have to talk with thebusiness owners in Middleton. - We do not want a repeatof that Shelbyville bankjob ten years ago. - No sir, we do not. That's whyI'm keeping my eye on him. - 24/7, Jake. This townis flush with holiday cash. For the next week, Leon Deeksis your one and only priority. - A DJ for the reception. What sort of music? All sorts. Yeah that's right, and any Christmas carolsyou can dance to. Thank you. Dried sage, sprinkled sea salt, spirit stones. Hello Derek. - You working on a potion? - No. Making a listfor the ceremony. - Well, I'm just hereon orders from the Chief. I'm going up and downthe block, making sure that all the shopkeepersare being extra careful. - Is there cause for alarm? - Oh, no. Just, you know, betterto be safe than sorry. Plus, it getsme out of the office. - Mm. And you can do yourChristmas shopping.- Yeah. - Is there someone specialyou're buying for this year? A young lady, perhaps?- Ah I wish. - You do? Hmm. How can I helpyou with that? - Got a sister?- No I'm afraid I don't. - Well, maybe I'll writea letter to Santa. - Now that's the spirit.Oh, and Derek, don't forget my pie plates.I need them back, so I can cookyou up something new. - Right. - Hmm. - There you are. Come helpme decorate the tree. - Aw, mom. Why did you wasteyour money on that thing? - Because it's Christmas. Why don't you putthe star on top. Remember that? - How can I forget? - You made that when you werefive years old. With a lot of love. - Life was prettynice back then. A long time ago. - Sweetie. [Knocking] - Merry Christmas, Ruth. - Leon. - Dad? - How you doing, angel? You're so big. Lasttime I saw you-- - You were sentenced to fifteenyears? Why are you here? - Well I'm out. Got five yearsoff for good behaviour. - Why are you here? - Well why not? We're family, right? - We were.- Look Ruth, that was a low blow, sending me divorce papers whileI was stuck in the pen. But I forgive you.- You forgive me? - Yeah, and to prove it, I'm gonna make this the biggest, best Christmas our little girlever had. Jodi, if you could haveanything, anything at all, what would it be? - I don't know. - Keep thinking about it becauseI'm gettin' it for you. - No. You are out of my life. And I'm going to make sure youstay out of Jodi's if I have to take youto court to do it!- Mom! - Hey! She's my daughtertoo, all right? - No. Get out! - At least letthe kid decide for herself. - Get out and don'tyou ever come back! - Oh! Which of these invitationsdo you prefer? - Uh, whichone do you like? - That one.- Me too. - Good. And I haveto run to the florist. There's been a run onpoinsettias, but I thinkI can swing it. - We have a biggerproblem than that. - I know. The golf courseand the BFW turned us down, because they were booked 9months in advance, but I thinkit'll all work out in the end. - Cassie, it's not aboutthe venue, it's aboutthe marriage licence. They have newID requirements, and some of your recordsdon't exist. - Yes. I suppose I havehad a checkered past. - Well I'm lookingfor the court documents, but six days until Christmas, and there's people gonefor the holidays...- What are you saying? - I'm saying that unlesswe can prove that you'reCassandra Nightingale, we might have to postponethe wedding. - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.Thank you very much. Did you get all your Christmasshopping done? Hello! Merry Christmas. - Um, I'm just looking.- All right, well let meknow if you need anything. - Okay. What are you doing? - Oh, people come into the storeso stressed this time of year. A little incense helps lightenthe energy. - You know, it smells reallyfamiliar. It almost smells like...- Like what? - Like my apple ginger pie. But how is that even possible? - Oh, you'd be surprisedat what's possible. You know, I'm a big fanof that pie of yours, and about a dozen other thingson your menu. I was wondering if, well, if you couldcater my wedding. - When is your big day?- Uh, Christmas Eve. - Oh. That is a tall order. But I'd love to.- Oh. I know how busyyou are this time of year. - Yeah. This season it's alwaysrush, rush, rush right upuntil Christmas finally arrives and then I can go home and relaxin my easy chair all day... alone. Oh wow.Look how that sparkles. - Oh yeah. I placed that thereto take advantage of the light. Try it on. - Me? Oh, no. I uh I'm not reallythe type to wear jewellery. - Are you sure? - You know, I should probablyget back to the bakeshop. - Okay. - Merry Christmas, Martha.- What? Oh yes, I suppose it is. - Oh, and be sure to sendme your wedding menuas soon as you can. - I will. Hello, Martha. - Miss Nightingale, I have been in and out of everyshop on this street. - Oh. Not one bagto show for it. - Oh I haven't been buying.I've been... I've been so busy... with the Citizen'sLeague and the ChristmasDecorating Committee, and oh! Of course, the Heritage Society, although, thank goodness, that's winding down now for the holidays.- Well, you know,I've been busy too. I guess you heard the good news.- The wedding? Congratulations. - Thank you. I hope you can makeit. I know it's very lastminute... - And Christmas Eve.The Mayor and I have several long-standing socialobligations. You understand. - Well it would mean a lotto me if you could be there. You really know how to makea party come alive, Martha. - I do? Yes, I suppose I do. Huh. ¿Make a party½. - So can I countyou in, then? - Leon! - Jake Russel. What, no back up? Tough guy. Can I talk to you?- Yeah, go ahead. Talk. - What are you doingin Middleton? - I'm visiting my family. You remember, the ones who have been without a husband and a fatherfor the past 10 years? Thanks to you.- I didn't rob a bank. They stillhaven't found the money. - I told them where I hid thatmoney. It's in a warehousein Shelbyville. - It wasn't there.- No? It's not really the money that'sbothering you, is it Chief? What's bothering you is thefamily you destroyed: my family. - You didthat on your own, Leon. I was just doing my duty. Don't give me a reasonto send you back there again. - Don't worry about me, Jake. Worry about yourself. - Mom's been kinda wired lately. Maybe something to help her, you know, chill. - The Spa in a Box. Lavender bath oils, relaxing facial and magnetic stones to placeon her pressure points. [Door bell tinkling] - I've got it! I've got it! - Got what, Martha? The Christmas spirit? I am going to be a personalwedding planner, and you aremy very first client! - Well, that is very thoughtfulof you, Martha. - I'll handle it all: music, menu, colour scheme, theme, from your--wait for it--12drummers drumming, to your partridgein a pear tree. - That sounds like you have somevery big plans. - Well they have to be big.I expect potential clients to take notice and hireme for future events. Now for the sevenswans a-swimming, I was thinkingice sculptures. - You know, I don't wantto dampen your enthusiasm, but how muchis this going to cost? - Not a penny. I intendon working gratis. It's only fair.It is my vision, after all. - Well I have a vision too, so maybe we can havea meeting of the minds. - Well, then you need to makesome decisions immediately. Luckily, I brought swatches. By the way, I would keep my eye on her, if I were you. I believeshe's Leon Deeks' daughter, if you know what I mean. [Door jingling] - Hey, guys.- Hi Lori. - Cassie, dad wants you to sign these sohe can get the marriage license. Something about permission to searchfor your birth records. Getting marriedsure is complicated. - It takes so many peopleto make it all come together. Lori, would you lookafter this? This is the ring your father'sgonna give me in the ceremony. It belonged to my mother.- It's beautiful. - Yeah it's one of the fewthings I have of my mother's. So I need you to take very goodcare of it until the wedding. - You can count on me. - Oh in that case, would youwatch the store for one minute? I've got to run downand pick up my wedding dress. - Dress? Ooh it has to be white. It can't be off white. We can't have you clashingwith the ice sculptures. - Okay! - She acts likeshe's the one getting married. - Okay. I think my mom's reallygonna like this. - Speaking of gifts, what are wegonna Get Cassie for Christmas? - I don't know.She's so amazing. The gift has to be amazing too. - Yeah. Hey Jodi, any ideasfor my new...? Step mom...?- Where'd she go? - She must have stepped out. - Brandon! Where's the ring! - Beats me. - I left it righthere on the counter. - It's gottabe here some place, okay? - Where? It couldn't justdisappear! - Lori.- We've got to find it. - What are we gonna tell Cassie?- We're not gonna tell Cassie. She's got enough on her mind.Just keep looking. [Brandon's voice, inaudible] Oh, hi Brandon. Hi Jodi. - Lori, whatare you doing here? - Uh I was just uh.... going for walk.You guys been shopping? - Yeah, I got my momthat Spa in the Box. Better go hidethis under my bed. Bye Brandon. - I know why you're here. You came over to accuse Jodiof taking the ring. - No. - You thought maybe she stoleit, right? Because of whoher dad is? Lori, I wantto find it too. - Brandon, I -- You're as badas Martha Tinsdale. - What's wrong, honey? - What do you mean? - Well, for one thing youhaven't complained once about doing all this Christmasshopping with me. - I've got a lotof things on my mind.- The wedding? - That and what happens after. I'm moving out. - To make roomfor the Newlyweds? George! You're sucha romantic. That's whyI fell for you. This is your chanceto start a new life. Ask yourself, what does GeorgeO'Hanrahan want, more than anything?- To put these packages down. My arms are killing me. - Well why don't you lug themto my place and I'll puton a pot of coffee. - You're on. Let's get thisstuff under the tree. - I don't have a tree. You knowI'm leaving for San Diegotomorrow. - You had to remind me.- You don't want me to go? - That's not what I meant. I know how importantthis trip is to you, Gwen. - Well, you're important to me, too, George. You know that. It just just... it justwouldn't be Christmas without my grandchildren.You understand. - I do. I really do. I love Christmaswith my grandkids. - Then whatare you saying? - I'm gonna miss you, Gwen. - Oh I'm gonnamiss you, too. But I'll be backbefore you can blink. Just in timefor a Happy New Year. - Dad? - Lori. Honey, have you got a problem? - Yeah. Brandon. - Brandon? What's wrong? - Well, I lost Cassie'swedding ring. - You, you did? - And I think Brandon's friendJodi knows where it is. - Why would she know? - Because she was right nextto it when it disappeared and I never said she stole it. I just wanted to talk to herabout it, but now Brandon actslike I hate her or something and I don't hate her, but what if she does havethe ring? I need to get it back. - Okay. All right.What did Cassie say? - Oh, you can'ttell Cassie. - All right. Well,I'll talk to Brandon. - Well, maybehe'll listen to you. He sure doesn'tlisten to me. - All right.It's gonna be okay. You go home. Okay? Your dad's got work to do. - Do you thinkwe'll find it? - Well, we'll giveit our best shot. - It's a steal. - What?- The scented shaving soap.It's only $4.99. That is what you were lookingat, wasn't it? - Uh yeah. Yeah.- Here. Take a whiff. - That's not bad. - Sandalwood.Very popular with family men. The women in their livesjust love it. Oh, that's not for sale. It's for the Santa who ringsthe bell outside my shop. - I don't see him.Where is he now? - Oh Carl's gota touch of the flu. The children's fund is gonnamiss out on all those donations. - Yeah, well things are toughall over. - I'm surprised you nevernoticed Santa before. Especially since you spend somuch time in this part of town. - I've been out walking aroundand window-shopping. I've got a lot of timeon my hands these days. - You know, with all that extra time, why don't you make good use ofit? All the kids will love you. - You gotta be kidding. - It would be a wonderfulway to show people you care. And since you'd be rightoutside, you couldpop in anytime and warm up witha cup of my mulled cider. - Wonder if it fits? - Looking at you, I would say it's a perfect fit. - Brandon? May I have a wordwith you please? - As soonas I finish this level. - Hey. I wasjust about to show Brandon how to make a customizedChristmas ornament for Jodi. - Well I'd just like to havea word with him before thetwo of you get started. Alone. - Ah. You want the old manto take a hike? Just what I need.A hike. - Why are you angrywith your sister? - She accused Jodiof being a thief. - According to Lori, she never said a word to Jodi. - She was going to. I guessLori thinks that just because Jodi's dad robbed a bank, it runs in the family. - Well, Lori's very upset.About the ring, and you. And Brandon, Jodi was rightbeside that ring whenit disappeared. - You know, the wholetown's against her. They think she's somesort of gangster. I expect this from MarthaTinsdale, not frommy own father. - Brandon? - Later.- Hey, Brandon. - Hi.- Hi. Uh... maybethis isn't the best time. - No. There's no timelike the present. - All right. Well, uh... I have the flowof the ceremony. I have to get a copy of thisto the minister, except... - Except what?- Well, I'm havingtrouble finding one. - Sometimes I wonder if allthis is going to work out. - Oh, it will. Trust me.We'll find a minister. And a venueand we'll get our license. - No, not that, Cassie. I've got Brandon mad at me. He's fighting with his sister. Lori's upset. And George... he's feeling likehe just wants to getaway from us all. I just wanna give everyonea family Christmas. - It's hard to havea family Christmas when you don't have a happyfamily to celebrate it. Bye. Thank you! Wow. So many gifts. - Well, it is a weddingshower, right? - Betty, I just, I can't thank you enough. - No. Wait 'til youtry your wedding cake. Oh that reminds me.You're gonna have to sample some of that sparkling winebefore I order it. - You know Betty, um... every woman deservesa little sparkle in her life. I want you to have this. - A gift? Cassie, I couldn't. - Oh, look at all those gifts.You deserve one too. - It is pretty but it's notreally my style. - Well, I tell you what.Try it for a few days, and if you don't like it,I'll exchange it. - Well, you don'thave to do that. - Customer satisfactionis my priority. - Well, if you insist.

I mean wedding. - Martha, I so appreciateall you've done. - Do you? Do any of you? I had a vision. Nine ladies dancing.Eight lords a leaping and a sheet cake would justcompromise the entire affair. I mean, who would hire me after that got around? No, I'm afraid thatI am going to have to bow out. - I'm sorryto hear that, Martha. - Well I couldn'thave attended anyway. I have a previous engagement. - Ho, ho, ho. - Oh. You're feeling jollyas well huh? - How can we havea Merry Christmas if everyone's so miserable?- Everybody? - Well, in my family, anyway.- Including you? - Guess so.- Why? - Because I don't have the...

Which frosting?- Beautiful. - Oh, yes it's gonna bebeautiful, but I want to know whichflavour. - No, I meant you. - Oh! Well, thank you. You know, after a day of wearing thisnecklace, I just had to go buy a new dressto go with it, and then I hadto buy new shoes, to go with the new dress, and got a new haircut to match my new outfit, and before I new it, I hada total makeover! It's amazing how this littlenecklace inspired a wholenew me. - Not new. The outer sparkle just helpedyour ¿inner sparkle½ shinethrough. - I'll say. You know, I'm sure whatever cakeyou make is, it's gonnabe great. - Thank you, Derek. Um I'm gonna go backto my bakeshop. - Oh, I'll uh... I'll walk you.- Okay. - Say, what are you doingChristmas Day? - Cassie, you're really doinga good job with those. - Thank you. Thanks. - I got our wedding license. - What? That's terrific. Really? How? - I just told the county clerkthat you'd been paying state and federal taxesunder the name, CassandraNightingale for years, and that if it was good enoughfor the Internal Revenue Service then who arethey do say otherwise? - Brilliant.We're on a roll. Now all we have to do it figureout a place to have the wedding. - Well what happenedto the Garden Club? - Well they won't let us usetheir solarium for the wedding. Somethingabout the body heat from the guestswilting the lilies.- That's ridiculous. - Well they've got a point. You and I have a wayof raising the temperature all by ourselves. Jake, lighten up. - Sorry, it's just... It's Christmas. Everything'seither booked or closedfor the holidays. - Well not to worry.I have a plan. - Yeah, you always do. - I also have our minister. He's happy to drivedown from Lakeville. Apparently he and Georgego way back. - Yeah, George. He's talking aboutmoving to Montreal. He's got a friendthat owns a restaurant there. - What? You and the kidshave to get together and figure out a wayto talk him out of it. - Cassie, we're not even talking. Well I've gotto get back to work. - Why don't you stop for a cupof coffee on your wayto keep warm. - What? What'sthat smile about? - I just remembered that I'mmarrying you on Christmas Eve. - Just a coffee please... Betty. - Just the usual, Chief Russell? - Yes. Yes. Well is this seat taken? - It is now, I guess. - Brandon, you can'tstill be mad at me. - Why not? You still thinkJodi's a thief. - I never said that. - It's tough on Jodi.She has such a big heart. She hides it 'Cause she has this reparound school. Because her dadwas in prison. - You know, I was beginningto think that you werevery close-minded. But you're not, not whenit comes to your friend. - She's funnyand fun, you know? The things she says, the way shedresses... she's different. In a good way. That's why I likeher so much. - Who does that remind you of?- Huh? - Your friend, Jodi. She soundsan awful lot like the womanthat I'm gonna marry. For all the same reasons. Christmas special? - Mm hmm. They top it with redand green sprinkles. - Ah. Well you letme pay for that. - Cassie already did. - Really? - Yeah. She sent me down here, said I deserved a treat. - So what brings you here, George? - My feet. I was just out for a long walk and I thoughtI'd knock on your door. Is, is this herbal tea? - No, something stronger.Irish Breakfast. - Oh. How'd you guessMr. O'Hanrahan would bepaying you a visit? I always feel welcome here. - Something wrong, Cassie? - Well it'sjust an old house and it needs a lot of TLC.It's a big responsibility. - Ah, you're up to it. - After the wedding, Jake andI will be staying at his house and I can't betwo places at once. - Are you sure?- Now, George... Yeah, running a B and B is... it's a hands on job. And half the time, I won't be here. I want to holdon to Grey House, but... but without the B and Bincome, I'm not so sure anymore. Ah, but I've been doing all thetalking. So, is there somethingon your mind? - No. Nothing. It's funny how a long walk sometimes willclear your mind. - Another cup of coffee, Chief? - No thanks. - Are you sure? You look a little tired. - I'm fine.- What, are youworking overtime? - Yeah.- You've been outhere almost every day. - Yeah. That's right. - Except tomorrow ¢causeyou're getting married. - I got that covered too, Leon. - Yeah I bet you do. Well, we'll seeyou around huh? Ho ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.Ho ho ho. Thank you very much.Merry Christmas to you. - I've got the dress.It's all fixed up and ready for the big night. - Oh. Thanks. - It's not aboutthe dress, is it? Lori, you cantell me anything. - I don't have the ring! I lost it. You gaveit to me. You trusted me and I let you down. - Oh honey, no tears. - But you told me it belongedto your mother. You said it was all you had leftfrom your old family. - I have my memories, and those can never be lost. And now I havemy new family too. So let me tell you somethingabout that old ring. It hasa mind of its own. - Huh?- I've misplaced it before, and that ring alwaysfinds its way back to me. - Oh, hello Miss Nightingale.- Hello Martha. - If you've come to ask me back,I'm afraid-- - Well I didn'tcome for that. I was wondering if you had thosecolour swatches thatyou showed me? - I might. - I was ordering tableclothsand there was this one shadeof ivory... - Oh yes, here it is.- Oh yes. - What on earth is this? - My ring. - How didit get in there? - Oh. Well what matters is youfound it, Martha. Thank you. - Heavens.That day in your shop, I emptied my purseon your counter, and after I swept everythingup again I must have... I feel just terrible. You're not angry? - Of course not. - I suppose I shouldn't havequit on you like that. Leaving you high and dryat the very last minute. Oh! I had had suchan extraordinary eventplanned for the two of you. - I know. That's whyI recommended you to a wealthy client who'sgetting married in the spring. - You did?- You have such energy, Martha, and enthusiasm! You're burstingwith creative ideas. And I thinkthe job pays well too. - What a lovely, unexpected gesture. - Why unexpected? - Well, for you to thinkof me after all that I... - Well it is the season where wethink of others first. Don't we? - I don't know what to say. - I know you and the mayor haveother plans for Christmas Eve, but the invitationis still open. - After all that I've done? - Ah, but there's so much moreto do, isn't there? Well, if your plans change, we'd love to see you there. Merry Christmas, Martha. - And to you. - Brandon! Cassie found her ring! - That's good. So now you mustfeel just great. - Pretty good. Not great. - Why not?- I went to seeJodi behind your back. Maybe I should have just toldyou what was bothering me? - That's what big brothersare for, right? - You're more than my brother, right? You're my friend.Aren't you? - Yeah. Yeah, I am. Maybe I didn't act likeone though. Sorry. Official wedding photographerreporting for duty! - Look at you. Wow. Here you go. - Thanks.- Where's Jodi? - Oh I'm gonna go get her. I hope she hasa good time tonight. Christmasis never much fun for her. - Never say never. - Where are you going? - Oh, down to the shop. - Don't you havea wedding to get to? - Yeah I forgot my sage. - Jodi and I could get it.- Would you? - Yeah. It's on the way. - Oh, thanks! All right. Justa small bunch of dried sage. I wanna burn a littlebefore the ceremony. Clear the air.Make way for new beginnings. Here you go. - Cassie, about your cake.I am so sorry. Um it was in the backof my van and unfortunately, so was my neighbour's daschund. - Oh, no.- Yeah. This tiny dogate the entire thing! Now, I am trying to get youanother one, but I'm totally sold out, and every other bakery from here to the state capitalclosed at noon. - Betty, put it out of yourmind. You get back to allthe other items on your menu. - No, but it's your weddingcake. What will we do? - Well, the firstthing to realize is that baking is about mixingtogether the right ingredients. - I have no ideawhat you're saying. - Then look at it this way: You just brought great joyto a daschund this Christmas. - Hello?- Hello, George? - Um, do you have cake mix? - Cake mix--I'll haveto check. Why? - Well I need a wedding cakefor thirty five guests in um... Two hours. Uh... George? - I'm here. A little shocked, but I'm still standing. - Maybe Lori could helpyou move things along. I'm counting on you two. - As I place this ringon your finger... - Okay. - Great. - Do you knowhow to tie one of these? George? Are you there? Was that Cassie? - Yeah. Yeah, it was. - What did she want? - A miracle. [Phone ringing] - Derek? - Chief, I found Leon's car, but I can't find him. - Okay. Stay on Main Street, stay with the car. As long asyou have the car, he's not going anywhere. You got it?- Copy that, Jake. - No cake mix? - Even if we had allthe ingredients, there's not enough time.- Hey, I know it looksimpossible but don't forget, you've gotGeorge never-say-die O'Hanrahanin your corner. - So what are you gonna do? - Beats me. [Phone ringing] - Derek? Oh. Yeah, hi. How are you? Really? You don't haveany other way to-- No, it's not your fault, no. Merry Christmas. - I hate to ask. - That was the minister. His carbroke down. He has no otherway to get here. - Maybe Derek could shootup there in the squad car. - No Derek's on duty. And evenif he could drive 100 milesan hour, it's a round trip. He'd stillnever make it on time. - Well, ask people to wait.Maybe we can serve themthese cookies. - Oh honey, we can'tdo that to people. Not on Christmas Eve. What goodis a marriage license if we don't have a ministerto tie the knot? - Robert Kowalskiand Teresa Quinn? - Who?- Who? - The nameson your wedding license. - Well they must have givenme the wrong one. I've been so busy I didn'teven bother to open it. - Jake--- Well, that's it.The wedding is off. - No! It can't be. - I'll have to speak to Cassie. You know, this wouldbe the first promiseI've ever broken to her. - [Brandon]: This willonly take a second.- [Jodi]: Oh, no problem. - She said a smallbunch of dried sage, hanging from the ceiling. - Um, don't most people usuallyhang mistletoe? - Cassie says it makesway for new beginnings. - I wish my family couldmake a new beginning. - What do you mean? - You're so lucky to have yourfamily and a dad like Jake. I used to. When I was little, ten years ago. - You remember that far back? I'd stand on his shoes, andhe'd waltz me around the room. I keep those memories up here.Locked away, like treasure. I take them outat night before I go to bed. That's howI remember him so well. - Do you wantto go to the party now? - Sure. - Cassie. - Jake, don't you know it's badluck to see the bride beforethe wedding? - I know. Honey, we can'tget married. [Door opening]- Greetings! - Uh, there's somethingI have to tell you. We've run into someroadblocks, and I'm afraid-- - Ah yes, the wedding.- What's, what's this? - I got a call from my friendat the county officeabout a mix-up. So Martha and I ran overto straighten it out. - Our wedding license!- They want to know if, by any chance, they gave youa different licence. Because there is a veryanxious couple namedKowalski in Lakeville who want to get married two daysafter Christmas. - Well, we can send it with theminister after our ceremony. - Uh, the ministercan't make it. - Why?- Car trouble. So even if we have thislicense, I don't see... - Well you don't but I do. I'll get someone to marry you.- In the next five minutes? - My dear, I happen to have... Connections. - Me?- Well yes, you. By the power vested in you, etcetera, etcetera. Why not?- Well it's been awhile. - Well mayor, you can take those. I know what I want to say. - Martha, thank you.Thank you for everything. - Everything? Whatever do you mean? - Well, you got us our license, our officiate, and the venue. Do you remember when you told methat the Heritage Society was winding downfor the holidays? You really are a great weddingplanner, Martha! - Well anyway, it's time for you two to startyour new life together. - Jake, would you escortour guests? - With pleasure. - Cassie did a wonderful job.It's a beautiful room.

That would be great, George! I could run the place. - What an interesting idea. - Well, I got it from you.- Did you really? - Yeah when you said youcouldn't be in two places at... once. - You know, it's a big job. - I could use a big jobright now. - On one condition.You wouldn't do all the work alone.We'd be equal partners. If you'll excuse me, I need to welcomeall my guests. Won't you come in? - How'd you knowI was out here? - Well, you weren'tin there, so I thought maybeyou were out here. - Yeah, well I came to getmy little girl. - Family is a very powerfulforce this time of year, isn't it? - I don't exactlyhave a family anymore. - Leon, where there's love, there's family. You don't haveto keep running. Come in from the coldwhenever you're ready. - Thank you, Betty.- You're welcome. - Isn't she a lovely bride? - Hope I'm notlate for dinner. - Gwen?- Hello, George. - I thought only Cassiepopped up like this. - I brought my daughterand grandchildren withme for a visit. They've never seen snow. But now the weather station saysno snow this Christmas. 0 Well they're wrong. Cassie'sforecast is for snow, tonight. - Well, I hope she's right.- You can bet on it. Is snow the only reasonyou came back? - You're the only reasonI needed, George. - I guess you haven't heard, but after the honeymoon, I'm moving into Grey House. - Really, George? - It's a big house.- I know. - Lots of room.- Yes. Yes, there is. - It can use someof my Irish hospitality. - No doubt. - There we go. - Excuse me. I wanted to give you this.It's all there. The money fromthe Shelbyville bank job. It was hidden underthe floor of your shop. - Cassie's shop? - Well, it wasn't a shopwhen I stashed it there. It was justan abandoned building. - Okay. This isn't exactlythe right time or place. - No, it is the time. ¢Cause I want my little girlto see me do it. I had a planto win Jodi back, I figured I could convinceher to run away and livewith her dad, but then I realized that youcan't buy love. And I don't wantto run anymore. - So how do we know this isn'tjust another con? - It's not a crimeto return the money. And Leon has done his time. - I know I've made somebig mistakes, all right? And I know it's going to taketime for everybody to trustme again, but I'm goingto stay right here, and do whatever it takes. Because I wantthat second chance. I want a family again. Jodi, I've never had anythingbut love for you. And I knowhow much I hurt you. I saw the hurt in your eyes the other night when you droppedthe silver dollar off for Santa. You were watching that familyon the street, weren't you? A happy family. And that's all you really wantfor Christmas. Not this... money. You said it yourself, angel, I was a good guy once. So can you letme be that guy again? A second chance. - I guess a second chanceis worth a try. - Jake! I put a lock on his car. Hecan't go anywhere, but he's... He's right here. - Yep. - Uh Chief, does this meanI'm off duty now? - Well Derek, you putthis in lock-up and thendo whatever you want. - So what do you say we get an early starton that Christmas date? - I'll save you a seatat dinner tonight. - Would this be a good timeto say Merry Christmas? - Ooh it's gonna be a very merryChristmas because tomorrowmorning I'm gonna wakeup with my family. - Do you know the momentthat I fell in love with you? It was when I first sawyou come down your stairs. - Well it took me a littlelonger to fall in love with you. It was when I reachedthe bottom of my stairs. - Of course, I didn't knowwhat I was in for. - Well, you still don't. - Cassie!
