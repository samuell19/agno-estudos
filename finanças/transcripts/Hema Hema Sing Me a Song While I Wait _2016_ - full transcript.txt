Consider yourself dead. You are here to prepare for the gap between birth and death. You have no identity. On No Moon you will be reborn. You do not need to speak. Just nod or shake your head. Is this your first time? How did you know here? I see. They will show you to your tent. Our last guest has arrived so the boundary is now closed. Today is the Full Moon. None of you will leave until No Moon. You want to remain unknown. That's why you all wear masks and skirts. You don't even want other people to know your gender. It's your own decision. You are here to find out who you really are. You are all here to find out what you would do if you were not known. This only happens once every twelve years, so don't waste this opportunity. So don't waste this opportunity. Do whatever you need to hide your identity and gender. I know you all. I have selected each one of you. No one else knows who you are. But there may be people who get a thrill from finding out who you are. Similarly, there will be some of you who might get a thrill from finding out who others are. Anonymity is power. If you give away your identity, you give away your power. There may also be people who already know you or who have an axe to grind with you. They may take this opportunity to harm you. Being anonymous is intoxicating. It brings out the reckless side of people. So be careful now and the rest of your life. Always watch your backs. Your masks are your temporary identity but they also protect you. Your power is that you are unknown. If you are in danger here, blow your whistle. But there is also a ceremony to celebrate life and death. So, we have dances, parties and plays. They can happen anytime. There is no fixed time. If you decide to go out of our boundary before we are finished, you can't come back, now or ever. I know some of you will break the rules. If you do, you will be unmasked and your identity will be known by all. You will be haunted for the rest of your lives. If you do something really grave, we will make you disappear and no one will ever know because no one knows you're here. The guards and I will be watching over you. This man was caught rummaging through another's belongings. We shall decide what we will do with him before No Moon. But for now, we will have to lock him up because he may know some of your identities. Announcing the first act! Come everyone! The Dance sf me Lard of the Charm Ground 'vs an. Commencing immediately on the main stage! Listen to me The death that you fear most has come. Fear not death, but be afraid of birth. You are in the bardo. You are on the border of death and birth. You are alone here. If you hear me, it's your mind hearing it. Even though you are dead, your mind's ear will hear me talking to you Even though you are dead, your mind's ear will hear me talking to you. Your eyes, ears, tongue, nose and body have left you. You will also hear your relatives crying. Let go of them. They don't know how to let go of you. Your soul will be in the Bardo realm It's uncertain how long you will linger here. Listen, In the presence of the Lord of Death in the court of the Netherworld, you will be judged. Today you will be judged. Have you deprived anyone of life? Have you taken things that are not given? Have you raped body or mind of others? And now the Snake will see with his dice. Oh you, have you seduced your mother? Have you chewed and swallowed your daughter? Have you raped your father? And now the pig will look at his mirror and see everything. Do not hide your negative actions, you must confess. Yes, you are hiding something! Yes, you have let a whole family suffer on earth. Pig can see it. What did you do? You had better confess before we find out, or else you will also be judged as a liar, and the repercussions will be graver yet. “Wait!” Says the White Goddess There must be one thing he has done right. Now, Monkey will weigh his deeds. The White Goddess urges the dead man to confess: 'You must confess. It's all your mind, you are confessing to your own mind.' 'He must have done at least a few good things in his past lives.' Nothing is predestined. Nothing is free will. There are no accidents. Come OH. Okay... but you go first. Plant rice, rice will grow. Plant barley, barley will grow. Plant rice, rice will grow. Plant barley, barley will grow. Plant negative actions, suffering will grow. Is that all you could find? Me, I had to go into the mask room. You look so funny! What is it? Why aren't you saying anything? Hey, who are you? I asked who are you. Who are you? Answer me What are you doing? Let me go! I said let me go! Oh, Noble one. Fear not death, for you are already dead. This evening, someone was killed. Be careful, the killer is among us, we may not know who did this. Even if we know we are bound by our oath never to reveal identities. But I want to tell the killer that your own conscience will haunt you forever. For now, we will offer him the finest funeral of our custom. You won't have a shadow. Nor will you have a footprint. You may have made your way back to your home, but no one is speaking to you, but no one is speaking to you, because no one sees you. Do not scream, for no one hears. You have awoken from the dream of this life. You will soon slip into the dream of the next life. We hope it will be a shining one. You have been stripped of the apparel of this body. Aim for a good one for the next life. For now, you are naked, this is not a moment to be wasted. Being naked is precious. Avoid looking back when you hear the cries of your loved ones. Be not in haste to choose the next companions or home. All what you see and hear, you see and hear because you looked and listened. You are your own master. You are your own architect. You are your own ferryman. You are the boat, you are the oars. Do not be disheartened by the horizon of the infinite ocean of life, for the horizon is here and now. 24 YEARS LATER, YEAR OF THE FIRE MONKEY Have you been here before? Twelve years ago, is it? Oh. You're an oldie Do you remember the rules? Hey, times have changed but the rules are mostly the same. We don't know you. You don't know us. No one knows each other here, and that's your power. Your father or mother, could also be here. But, of course, you wouldn't know. So, I suggest you don't go pinching anyone's bottom. Understand? You have been dead for a long time. Now you will forget your name. Old friends and family mean nothing now. You will be famished for different foods and long for different nests. You have been dead for a long time. Now you will forget your name. Old friends and family mean nothing now. You will be famished for different foods and long for different nests. Agay. Agay. What? What's happening? A tent caught on fire. Nothing to worry about. But Agay... listen to me. Have you ever raped someone? What?! Who is this?! Are you going crazy? Crazy? I have been crazy for 24 years. Get out! I'll call the guards. Go ahead. Blow your horn. I left a note in my home, that if do not return in several days, I have been murdered by you. Wait... Calm down Tell me where she is? You know the rules. To hell with your rules! Why do you want to know? Wait... Did you rape her? I never knew a momentary incident would affect my whole life. Think twice before you show your face. My life was finished a long time ago. I have nothing to lose, I have no face. Oh, now I know, You also killed her husband too didn't you? I have been searching for her everywhere. Tell me where she is. Where is she? She's dead. She died giving birth to a daughter. Are you saying... She may be yours... Maybe not. Where is the girl? How much do you make? How much do you make? What if... you didn't have to work here? I mean... what if you didn't have to work here? What? Will you take care of me? Wait for me.
