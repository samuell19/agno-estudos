Hey, Logan. I could have picked you up in New Haven. That's all right. Your grandfather's sleeping. Let me look at you. I'm starving. [ Groans ] I have some ratatouille, okay? Everybody had it for dinner. I'm sleeping downstairs now. I turned the den into my bedroom. It's just fewer electrical currents. It's better for my energy. So you can have my bedroom upstairs, okay? You mean the sewing room? Yeah. You have a beer? You shouldn't drink. A belly runs on your father's side of the family. See all these old photographs I found in the attic? [ Chuckles ] Grandma must've put 'em up there years ago. Look at your brother. [ Chuckles ] Can you help me with one of these? Hey, look. This was taken just before he went to war. [ Clears Throat ] Hmm. [ Clears Throat ] [ Tapping ] Anna. [ Tapping Stops ] Do that tomorrow. - Hey, Benny. - Talk to you in the morning. [ Clears Throat ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Man Speaking, Indistinct ] Hey. Hey, Josh. Hey, baby. [ Laughs ] Look at-- [ Groans ] Hey. I came for the weekend. Yeah? Why didn't your mother let you sleep some? Did the barbers go on strike at the beach? [ Chuckling ] What's going on up here? Wait, wait, wait. I got something to show you, Josh. I'm not interested in photographs of your girlfriends. Uh-huh. Okay. All right. That would be nice. Show my son how to meet some ladies, for Christ's sake. You know? [ Laughs ] Yeah. Oh-- Hey, Grandma. Does anybody hate Grandma?

I don't think this is real. What's this printed on? Hey, Josh, let me have a handshake. Come on! A firm handshake for Christ's sake. Show that your grandfather's still cookin' with gas. Huh? Okay. All right. An announcement. An announcement. [ Laughs ] Health food makes me sick. Huh? Rosita, tomorrow I want you to order me a big T-bone steak. Oh, Dad, no. Medium rare. I'm gonna inhale the goddamn thing. No, Dad. You can't have that-- Since we've been eating this new veggie diet, I'm going to the shitter like almost twice a day. No kidding. Is there anything else we can talk about? All you guys talk about is your golf... and your bowel movements. What else is there? [ Laughing ] [ Anna ] There's another town meeting next week... to discuss the new zoning laws. [ Grandfather, Indistinct ] Dad, did you hear what I said? Dad, there's a town meeting. Don't feed the dog. [ Laughs ] Come here. Come here. Come here. All right. I give up. I give up. Geez. Josh. Have you talked to your brother lately? You asked me already. No matter what happens-- no matter what-- you should always stay close to your brother. - Family is all. - [ Grandfather Chuckling ] Josh, come on. What? Let's take a walk together. [ Anna ] Dad. Hey, look. I lost a lot of weight. Okay. Dad, sit down. That's right. We're going to take a little walk together, Josh. Um-- Come on. Yeah, okay. Go ahead. It's okay. So, Grandpa, how's Grandma these days? Oh, the same. Except for her memory. You know? You know, when I was a kid, we used to shoot the squirrels, skin 'em and make a stew, and now I feel guilty. [ Chuckles ] I've been feeding 'em, but the birds keep stealing the food. I wish your mother and uncle... would stop feeding me those goddamn grains. I'm 83 years old. It's too late to change. ** [ Singing, Indistinct ] He's minus three. [ Man On TV, Indistinct ] Yeah, he was-- Just a minute ago he was minus six. He was never minus six. Who am I thinking of? [ TV: Applause ] Hey, Benny. Can you take me for a ride? They're on the 15th. I want to see the water. Please. Now? Give me 10 minutes. Okay.

The conductivity of the various minerals reacting with your system... help me determine ailments... in the various levels of your immune system. Mmm. [ Machine Beeps ] I was reading about your other son in the paper. Yeah? Did you know him? I didn't vote for him, but I now sort of agree with his ideas for Madison. I don't. No way. - [ Benny ] What's the needle say? - [ Grandfather Laughs ] I remember when Main Street was a dirt road... and the Indians that lived north used to come into town and trade. Really? Yeah. [ Laughs ] [ Benny ] Dad, don't distract him. I'm an old codger. [ Laughs ] All right, I'll be right out, okay? Thank you, darling. Okay, Dad. Okay. What do you think? Well, I have to be honest with you. I see a lot of people, and alternative medicine-- It's-- It's not a cure. Well, sometimes it can be, but I can only say that I can't turn things around. I can't offer any miracles. He's lost a lot of weight. That's what the regular doctors say. Look, you can keep doing what you're doing. He's lived a full life. Just be with him. Okay, um-- Thanks. Yeah. Bye-bye. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. Hey, Tina, it's me. [ Woman, Indistinct ] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hey. Hey. Do you miss me? Wha-- Yeah, of course I do. Have, um-- Yeah, have you seen the guys?

Listen to me. She doesn't have a visa. You're paranoid. Nobody knows who she is. Josh, it's a small town. Why don't you do me a favor and lock her up in your bedroom, because that's what she wants anyway. Okay? Hey, Grandma. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Groans ] Okay. Here. Just put-- Is that your stuff? Yeah, most of it. Put that by the door, please. I thought you were gonna, like-- I thought you were gonna get your own place when you moved to Madison. I was. I was. This is only temporary. One thing led to another, and there you go. I am. I'm going to. Here. [ Groans ] Can you just-- Why are you looking at me? Just put those over there. Now look. We can clear all the useless stuff out of here, then the chi will flow more freely through the house, and-- What? Siv will heal. I don't want to touch that. Seriously? You're such a baby. What's this? Do you need help? Oh, my God. What? [ Anna ] I had no idea. [ Chuckles ] Whoa. Yeah. Come on. [ Chuckling ] Holy shit. Dad. [ Siv Chuckling ] Yeah? Jesus Christ. Why the hell would I want to see that, huh? Put it away. Put it away. Bury it. [ Exhales ] [ Grunts ] All right. You're welcome. Hey. Why don't you get the fishing poles... from the basement and go with Siv? [ Laughs ] Remember? How he used to take you fishing? Well, I'm going back to the beach house in a couple days. No, you're not. I paid three months' rent already. I paid. Actually, your grandfather paid. Now things have changed. Mom, I'm not-- I'm not going to spend my last college summer here. Yes, you are. No! This is too fucking boring. You've forgotten how generous your uncle and grandfather-- When's the last time your father sent me anything? Don't. Stop. Don't bring my dad into this. Everything your grandfather does this summer will be for the last time. I-- He wants you here. Okay? That's final. Dad? Yetta's getting cranky. It's time for bed. Who took my candy, huh? Who took the candy? [ Laughing ] I don't know. What kind of a family am I running here? Dad. Take Yetta upstairs. Oh, Yetta. Yetta. Let's go. Come on, baby. Let's get outta here. Huh? Come here, sweetheart. Yeah. Let's go. And on with the coat. * And away we go * * Away we go to have a good time * * Have a good time * Siv, stop playing tricks. Take her upstairs. Take her upstairs?

[ Benny ] Okay. [ Man ] Oh, my God. [ Chuckling ] The last time I saw you, you were just a freshman declaring the glories of naked keg stands. Hey, Carmine. I'm impressed you remember. I can appreciate such rites of passage. Are you saying you were a badass? Badass? Well, no. No. Well, just don't let your constituents hear that. Good word for a frat boy. I'm independent. [ Laughs ] Anyway, what brings you here? Well, you know why I'm here. I don't care to discuss it anymore, Anna. It takes two. Please. Don't let Benny keep you away from your own father. I'm working. Dad knows. If he wants to, he can come here. Not really. [ Anna ] He's too proud. I'd rather-- Why is everybody so afraid to offend Benny? [ Scoffs ] Offend? Yeah. No-- You know exactly, Anna. Dad knows the truth. Benny turns it around. - It's been three years. - Five years. I've been waiting five years for an apology from him. How many times-- No, he can come here. Dad's dying, Carmine. It's your choice. Come on. Your mother's always been like that with me. Storming in. [ Chuckles ] She might not go about it in the right way, but she means well. [ Inhales ] You know, it's amazing... how time flies by. It's good to see you, Carmine. Yeah. I like you better without the beard. You think so? [ Laughs ] Mom! What? Why do you have to make a scene like that? Like what? He's an adult. Let him do what he wants. Josh, this is family. If there's anything-- You can't make apologies after Siv's gone. I need to stop at the post office. Why-- Why would I be breaking up with you? [ Woman ] You've been away for at least a week. No. I'm saying I'm coming back. It's just taking a little-- Do you miss me? Yeah, of-- No, of course I miss you. [ Indistinct ] Will you stop? Josh, we've been through this. You're being stupid. Don't yell at me.

I don't have time for this, Josh. No. [ Indistinct ] Will you just listen to what I'm saying? Do you think I want to be here? Yeah, if you really wanted to be here, you'd be here. Do you? I don't like it when you yell. [ Indistinct ] What do you mean I'm no fun? [ Indistinct ] [ Stammering ] Just stop. Stop. Will you listen? [ Dial Tone ] Fuck!

Everybody's looking for you. What's the matter? I'm, uh, destined to be single or divorced. [ Laughs ] That's ridiculous. Nobody's married anymore. You're divorced. Benny's-- Whatever-- Still at home. And, uh, it's like it's in our genes or something. Josh, that is just stupid. Your dad and I were not meant for each other. You know that. Right? You never really tried to work it out. Josh, please. Of course we did. [ Exhales ] How? How? You just got up and left. [ Chuckles ] It took me years to build up the courage. You know that. I wasn't happy. And then you insisted I sign that letter. That-- That was a mistake. A mistake? Dad says you didn't need to put me through that-- Josh. You know what? You made me take sides. [ Laughs ] I was 16. I could've lived with both of you. I'm sorry. [ Sniffles ] I'm sorry. I'm gonna-- What do you want me to say? I'm gonna get a burger. [ Knocking ] [ Mutters ] [ Chuckles ] Hey. Everyone's looking for you. [ Chuckles ] Sorry I'm not as active as usual. I need rest. Uh-- Grandpa, can I ask you a question? Sure. How can you love the same woman for so long? Hmm! So long.

I don't need any of that fuckin' bird food. Okay, Dad. Tumor fevers? Yeah. He hasn't had one in a couple of weeks. Damn. It's okay. I'm sorry. [ Sobs ] It's okay. It's okay. [ Moans ] [ Man ] How do you do it? [ Chuckles ] I don't know. Back and forth? No. Vibrators vibrate for a reason, so you gotta get in there, move it around, little circles, little up and down. Every time she thinks that she knows... what you're doing, mix it up a little bit. So you start off with one-- [ Man ] You assholes! You haven't even done the other side. I made an estimate for this to be primed tomorrow. - Yeah, you made a bad estimate. - Hey, fuck you, Lenny. Sort of a prick. [ Gasps ] [ Giggles ] Jesus! Ay, it's just me. Relax. [ Laughs ] [ Groans ] It's okay. What? Um, hello. What are you reading? N-Nothing. Can I see? Rosita, could I possibly get a little privacy in this house? Take me for an ice cream. Okay. All right.

[ Seagulls Screeching ] [ Sighs ] So Jennifer's been sleeping... with this lifeguard she's so in love with, otherwise she wouldn't have given me her car. We're having a lot of fun. I can't believe it. Except Andy brought home this 15-year-old girl one night. I heard. Yeah. How's Chris? Why are you asking? What's the matter? Nothing. I was just asking how my best friend is. Yeah, but what are you asking? Is this with butter? Try it. You see that island? My grandfather, when he was a kid, canoed out there with a friend... and his dog Pete-- Mmm. and, uh, there was a storm, and the dog swam all the way back... and found these firemen, and they came and they rescued them. It's a story. I don't think so. How did the dog tell the firemen what to do? [ Chuckles ] I don't know, but it happened. My uncle's been coming up here on weekends for years. He helped my grandfather run the shoe store, helped him retire, never been married, lives at home. And my mom-- She's just hanging on. I don't know. I can't-- Can't what? I can't go back with you. I just drove five hours. Where you going? No, this-- this entire summer has just been a complete waste. I've just been waiting-- Just get in the car. God. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. [ Engine Stops ] You know what? [ Sighs ] No, I'm not coming in. Look-- [ Sighs ] No. Tina, don't be dramatic. No. Thank your mother for me. Hey, come inside. You know, I didn't cheat on you. At least you had the guts to do this face-to-face. - I didn't! - Then why did you mention it? I didn't bring it up.

And the girl-- I don't know what your-- I don't think I'm in the right state of mind. You don't have to be in the right state of mind. It can be a one-night thing. [ Carmine ] Hey, Josh. Hey. Can I speak to you for a second over here? Sorry. It'll just take a minute. Yeah. Hey. How did you know that I would be here? Listen. Um, I got a call from a friend of mine-- a lawyer in New Haven who said Benny came to visit him the other day. Mm-hmm? Has Benny spoken to Anna about changing Dad's will? I don't know. I don't think so. Hmm. 'Cause my friend said he told him he wasn't taking on any clients, but there are a lot of lawyers who would very well-- What I'm saying is that... when someone's about to die, it's easy to think about the rewards. You understand? Why don't you just talk to my Mom yourself? Or Siv? Yeah. Okay, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'm sorry if I interrupted-- Don't worry about it. See ya. Yeah. [ Benny ] Don't make this hard. [ Rosita ] What is the problem? What is the problem? [ Stammers ] Because you're never there. You're never looking after Mom when I need you to be looking after Mom. [ Rosita ] I don't understand. You don't have to understand, Rosita. Just pack your stuff, okay? [ Rosita ] How can you fire me? Because it's my decision! [ Rosita ] You have to ask your sister. I don't have to ask my sister. [ Rosita ] She's not going to agree to this. I don't have ask Anna anything. [ Footsteps ] [ Muttering ] Uncle Siv-- [ Exhales ] [ Sighs ] [ Whispering ] Ay.

Exactly what it looks like, Benny. I came to see Dad. Oh, to repay the loan? - Not now, Benny. - What's going on? Well, you know, I have-- You know, that was a loan. Are you accusing me of stealing? This is bullshit. And then-- Oh, go fuck yourself. you let the town turn around and turn the street into a fucking plaza? It's commercially zoned. Yeah, it's not the 1950's, Benny. You're pushing us out. Carmine-- Allowing a doctor's office to move in next door-- Come back inside. so you don't have to take Dad to Branford. He doesn't need a doctor. Are you-- [ Anna ] Stop it. You lied to me. It's a gift! Stop it! No, no, no. I'm not going to forget this. You can go fuck yourself. Oh, I can fuck myself? Wait, Carmine. Come back inside. Everybody, let's just go back inside. What is this? And where are you going? He fire me. Benny, you can't make that decision by yourself. She'll stay with her sister. You'll need me. Oh, great! Oh-- Every-- Okay, everybody leave. Benny can take care of Siv and Yetta by yourself. Would that make you happy? Rosita, just get in the car. Rosita, don't get in the car. Get in the car. Do not get in the car. Now. Rosita. I-- I'm going. I left my sister's phone number in Nueva York... on your dresser. Okay? You call me. [ Benny ] Did you break this? Get in. You'll be back. Are you an idiot? Anna, don't make this harder, okay? You think you could do everything now? Are you Superman now? Can we talk about this later? No, we're not going to talk about it later. Later when? Mom. Huh? Mom. Mom. Mom. Later when? [ Man On P.A. ] Train approaching. Please remain behind yellow line. Get your bag. Train approaching. [ Tires Squeal ] ...behind yellow line. [ Train Horn Blowing ] Train approaching. Please remain behind yellow line. [ Rattling ] [ Coughing ] Mmm. Ohh. Where's Yetta? With Benny. Where's Benny? I think he went to Guilford to get the mail. [ Groans ] Mmm. Do you need anything else? What day is it? Sunday. There's no mail on Sunday. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] You're right. I don't know. [ Both Chuckle ] Dad, would you like to see Carmine? Yes. Mm-hmm. Siv's been getting worse. Did I tell you what he said to me? He called me a failure. When? Earlier this summer. Why? For leaving your father, who Siv always liked. But he-- He doesn't understand why I wasn't happy. Mom. Don't cry. I don't care. Doesn't it look nice? Yeah. [ Laughs ] I showed it to Siv. He said I wasted money planting flowers. They'd go out and play golf every weekend, and I plant wasted money. Siv's-- Siv's ill. You can't take him seriously. No. I was living in Baltimore for grad school, and I really needed a car so I wouldn't have to take the bus. And Siv bought the boys a car. And they were still home. But I was the one that really needed it. When I-- [ Sniffles ] I went to Stop & Shop this morning to get him some more iced tea. Everyone's so healthy. [ Sobbing ] This is really hard. It's okay. It's okay. I-- I have to remind Yetta I'm her daughter. [ Sobbing Continues ] Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You know, Yetta-- Yetta losing her memory... is almost for the best. You know? For who? For Siv, you know. He-- He doesn't have to see her mourn. You know, he doesn't have to see her... hurt. You know, it would-- it would, like, destroy him. [ Sniffles ] Uh-uh. I guess you're right. [ Car Drives Up ] You all right? Yeah. What? I'm fine. What? [ Sniffles ] I'm glad you're here. What-- Hey, Carmine. [ Chuckles ] I could feel you coming up the stairs. Wow. How you doing? Tired, but otherwise-- You know. Cookin' with gas? [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Cookin' with gas. [ Chuckles ] Cookin' with-- Oh, I'm so proud of you. [ Moaning ] Dad. I just want you to know that I find myself doing things just like you, and I-I'm starting to really understand the things-- [ Josh ] Carmine. that work in life. - What? - Benny's downstairs. I don't know if-- Oh, come on. I know. Oh, uh, Carmine, go down this way. [ Benny ] Carmine. You talk to Dad? Yeah. You say what you needed to say? I'm, uh-- I'm out of here. Hey, dude. I need-- I need to borrow your car. [ Lenny ] What? No fuckin' way. No, I'm serious. No, it's okay. Do you drive stick? No. Just will you forget work? Come on. Please. All right, where are we going? Just go sit next to him. I think that's his lawyer. It's gotta be. [ Door Shuts ] [ Benny ] I-I just find it very easy to write to you, for some reason. Oh. Well, I love that you said that, because, you know, what you write to me is so sensitive sometimes-- about your father. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Well, I can't talk to anyone at home. No, I understand. Yeah. [ Exhales, Clears Throat ] I-I-I've been so looking forward to meeting you. And now I-- I've never done this-- this computer thing before. - My sister encouraged me. - Yeah, me either. [ Both Laughing ] [ Woman ] You write so beautifully. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you find me attractive? Yes. Good. [ Chuckling ] I lost 30 pounds since my divorce. Uh, you, uh-- You were married? Is that bad? No. No, not-- not at all. Probably-- Uh-- You're not against it though? Oh. Um, well, I'd have to be really certain. Yeah. I'm exactly the same way. What happened? Your uncle is a fat, bald loser. [ Keys Jingling ] [ Exhales ] [ Exhales, Coughs ] [ Grunts ] [ Clattering ] [ Bicycle Bell Ringing ] [ Bicycle Bell Ringing ] Hey, how you doing? [ Sniffles ] Oh. It's nice to see you. [ Coughing ] Hey, what'll it be, Siv? Oh, me darlin'. Two eggs, sunny-side up, rye toast. Sorry. We stop serving breakfast at 11:00. Oh. Well, what do I usually have for lunch? The hot dog and potato salad special? Get your ass in gear. Okay. [ Chuckling ] Hey, Siv. Hey, Pot.

Listen. we're going to New Haven tonight for the jazz fest. You wanna come with us, you and Yetta? Well-- Well-- What time is it going on? About 6:00. Well, maybe. But listen. What I wanted to talk to you about was-- I had a dream about Mama. And the two of us were-- We were-- We were crawling around... and we were asking for a cookie. Aw! [ Both Laughing ] A dream? Yes. And then what happened? Well-- I don't know. I forgot. I can't remember. [ Both Laughing ] You wanna have a seat? No, no, no, no. I just wanted to see you. Gotta be going. I love you, Bedusa. I love you. Yes. [ Chuckles ] God bless. Yeah. Bye, Silvio. I don't know what Anna was talking about. He looks fine to me. [ Groans ] Quittin' finally. [ Grunts, Sighs ] Well? Hmm? * Don't bogart that joint, my-- * I lost my virginity on that beach. [ Laughing ] What? I thought I saw my grandfather ride by on a bicycle. [ Sighs ] That's good pot. [ Exhales ] Aw, geez. Okay. [ Moaning, Shuddering ] [ Moaning Continues ] Mom, what are you doing over there? [ Clears Throat ] I-I-I should have been here today. Yeah. Where were you? I, um-- I had coffee with a woman. Is that really what's important right now? Well-- You know, before Dad dies. S-So he'll know. Oh. So-- What? So he'll know what? He'll know that I have someone in my life. [ Scoffs ] You can't understand that? No, I can't understand that. Oh, for Christ's sake. You need to-- You need to go-- You need to just-- Josh, I, uh-- I need you to talk to your mother. About what? Well, let me tell you. I've got to know that I can go out from time to time-- But she's not a nurse, Benny. She's not supposed to do everything so you can go on fucking dates! Is that what's important to you? Will you get Rosita back? [ Knocking ] [ Siv ] Hey. [ Chuckles ] Was that you riding a bicycle? That's our secret. [ Laughs ] [ Chuckling ] Okay, I knew I wasn't seeing things. Don't tell anybody. You got it. [ Chuckles ] You know, I was just thinking. When-- When we were in high school, uh, right when, uh, band practice would let out, I would wait for Yetta, and we would take a walk home from school. She was the most beautiful gal you've ever seen. I want you to do something for me. What's that? When I die-- [ Chuckles ] [ Groans ] When they lower me into the ground, I want you to, uh, shoot some fireworks into the air, like the Fourth of July, hmm? Like I'm going to heaven. For my wife. Will you do that for me? Okay. You got it. Yeah, you do that for me. Benny! Hi. Hi. I knew you'd want me back. I knew it. All right, let me get-- Oh. Gracias. How are you? Good. ¿Sí? My cousin took me to the Lincoln Center... and the-- the Statue of Liberty-- [ Speaking Spanish ] and the-- the Rock Hard Cafe. That's nice. Yes. I miss you too. [ Chuckles ] We had to walk up this hill. [ Sets Glass On Table ] We run right into a fucking tank. [ Chuckles ] Everybody scatters. My M1 gets jammed in the mud. I thought, "Holy shit. I'm a goner." [ Door Opens ] [ Benny ] Josh. I need to talk to my dad for a minute. Privately. Yeah. [ Chuckling ] What's up? Okay. Siv, um-- Going over these papers, and-- Yeah. You know, Yetta's just not capable of taking care of the family... the way you've got it here, you know that. Uh-huh. And if Carmine and I are coexecutors, you know nothing is ever going to get done. Mm-hmm. Listen, I know your wishes better than anybody in this family, and I-- I promise you... that-- that I will run things just exactly as you run them. Yeah. Okay? So I made some changes here. So-- Hmm. What did Anna say to this? It's-- It's best. Okay. Okay. Here you go. Just, um-- [ Yetta Laughing ] Hey, mamita, you're going to feel so much better. I promise. Okay? Yes. [ Squealing ] You're going to feel so much better. No. Yes. You smell like a cow. No! Come on, mamita. Come on. I don't wanna take a bath. I don't wanna take a bath. You need to. Ay! I don't want to take a bath! Okay. You don't have to. I don't! Okay. [ Paper Rattling ] [ Chuckles ] Have you ever seen Grandpa's will? No. Why? I was just curious. Hmm. [ Club Strikes Ball ] [ Sighs ] Okay. [ Sighing ] [ Car Approaching ] Okay. [ Josh ] And then you remember when you took me and my brother to Lake Placid, and we went on the bobsled, and Seth was all into it, but I was all scared-- How does that thing work? I put the receiver behind his headboard. Hmm. Why you all dressed up? Ay! I have a date. [ Laughs ] You do? Mm-hmm. With who? Carmine. [ Siv ] I appreciate that, kid. Thank you. You're more than a grandson to me. Have a good time. Gracias. Bye. Just do your best. Keep your word. Hello. [ Laughing ] Hey! What-- What? Ay! I think I little overdressed. Mr. Casual here. I'm so sorry. You look great. Oh, thank you. Good to see you. Thanks for coming. You too. Well, so-- so what did you think we were going to do? I don't know. A little dancing. [ Laughs ] Uh, no. I'm not much of a dancer. No? I can teach you. No, not me, but-- [ Siv ] There's one thing in life I've-- I've learned-- Now you're jealous. Not at all. Ah, Jesus, it took me all this time to understand. [ Josh ] What? What? What? Forgiveness. You can't expect people... to always live up to your expectations. Hmm? To waste time resenting and being angry. Whoever you find, pay attention to her. I was lucky to have such a beautiful wife. Yeah. I-- I just-- I'm-I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to have a relationship... that lasts like you. I mean, no one else in this family can. Yeah, but always try to forgive, because it keeps together the one thing in life... that really matters. What's that? Family. Hey, kid, you know what I'd like right now? What's that? [ Siv ] I'd like a glass of sweet wine. German wine. Okay? What'd he say? He wants to make a toast. Wait! Wait! Come back! Come back! Enjoy it. Thank you. Here we go. All right. To our father-- Ah. my best friend-- Uh-huh. [ Chuckles ] and a wonderful man. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] [ Josh ] Our hero. Hmm. A great husband. Hey, come on. This is supposed to be my toast. Oh! I just wanna say-- Who farted? Oh, Dad! [ Laughing ] Okay, time-- time for a picture. Take a picture. Everybody, everybody. Get close. Get closer. And-- Puzza! And smile! [ Shutter Clicks ] [ Man ] * You took me like a drifter takes a friend * [ Man ] ...the huge dreams that changed your life? * I'll never be that honest again * Josh-- [ Continues, Indistinct ] * When it seems like * What do you have to say about that? * Nothing's gonna change * Mr. Winters? I asked you a question. * Then your world comes crashing down * Are you with us? - I'm sorry. Can I actually be excused? - * Ohh * * Your friends accommodate your darker phase * * And then you find it's been a hundred days * * When's the last time you remember feeling safe * * You're surrounded by assassins in this place ** [ Woman ] Do you know what you want to say to God when you arrive? No. Nothing. Hmm. I follow... my good conscience. Well, have you thought about heaven and hell? Well, I've already been to hell. War... is hell. Hmm. Is there any way... that you could make it come faster? The tumor is taking care of that. Is there anything else? I wish I didn't waste half my life... being mad at my father. He did the best he could. Yeah, I realize that... now. Looking back, you just can't-- Oh! Can't. I want my family with me, please. [ Siv ] Hey, Josh. Been a long time, baby. Come here. Here's a gift for you. Take my watch. It's yours. Okay? [ Chuckles ] Look at you. You're a feast to my eyes, baby. God bless you. Oh, yeah. And you, sweetheart. My God. Hey, Daddy. You know I love you, don't you? Yeah, Dad. Yeah-- Rosita, would you go in-- There's a huge mess on the floor. There's milk all over the floor. Okay, okay. Just-- Just spend a little time with Yetta, okay? Benny. Benny, I wanna say something. Yep? Even though we have our differences, I think we need to discuss what happens to Dad's properties after he dies. Yeah, well, he always thought you were much more capable than I. I never wanted it to be a contest. Well, Dad has asked me to look after his properties. That's fine. You-- You know, you deserve it. You're by his side. I just was wondering if we can talk about-- No, no. Those are his wishes. Okay? Wait a second. Is that right? Yeah. Where's-- Where's he-- - What's going on? - What's he doing? I don't know. You mean these wishes? Wh-Where did you get those? Siv asked me to retrieve it. You got a problem with that? He said he made a mistake. What was that? Well, when he agreed to it, he never included his daughter as a coexecutor. Well, if he had, then I would've-- What, Ben? Nothing. All three of you should be deemed coexecutors. That way if you disagree-- The third vote determines our collective decision. Exactly. Fine. Did Siv really say that? [ Moaning ] [ Moaning Continues ] Shh. Grandpa. Hmm? Grandpa. Hey. Mm-hmm? I got-- I have a-- a surprise for you. No! No more surprises. No. No. No, no, no. Look. So everyone knows you're going to heaven. [ Moans ] I think our world-- [ Moaning ] I killed a man. You-- You were in war though. You don't know. I shot-- Shot? I shot... an American. How? He came-- He came... running back. By accident. I was... scared shitless. I-- Hey. Hey, I know. I know. I... accepted a medal. It's okay. It's okay. You're still going to heaven, Grandpa. You're still going to heaven. Oh, no. I... did my best. I know. Hey, Dad. I love you. You could go, Dad. You could go. Hold his hand. I-- I always loved his flat thumbnails. When I was a kid, I used to sit on his lap and play with his thumbs. [ Benny ] Can I sit with him alone? [ Chair Scrapes Floor ] [ Sobbing ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] Rosita. ¿Sí? Can you take my mom for a walk? Now? Yes. Now, please. Okay, mamita. Thank you. [ Sighs ] Hey, come on, mamita. Let's go out. I don't want to go anywhere. Oh, you want to go to the town to get a coffee. No, I don't. I hate you. Shh. Okay, okay. The doggy-- The doggy, he wants to go for a walk. I can take the dog by myself. Okay. Here. You take. Okay. [ Anna ] Is he in pain? I don't want him in pain. He still has his hearing. Siv? Grandpa? It's okay. [ Gasping ] [ Exhales ] Come here! Bye, Dad! Bye, Dad! [ Sobbing ] Bye-- [ Sobbing Continues ] Dad. [ Chattering ] Seth. Hey, bro. Hey, bro. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Anna Whispering ] I think Siv would've wanted it this way, okay? Mmm. Okay. I'll stand over there. I was looking for you. What are you doing? Nothing. [ Sniffles ] Mom drives me crazy. What's new? [ Laughs ] Just seeing her makes me all-- You know? But our whole family is like from the backwoods. Why, because they're not L.A.? That's not what I'm saying. Some are strange. Just... have nothing to say to 'em. Yeah, but, you know, they're family. It's a nice night. Yep. I really wish I got to say good-bye to Siv. I'm gonna go talk to Mom. [ Chuckles ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Guests Chattering ] Have you seen Yetta? There's this really complex sequence. See, I tell you, he's the next big thing. It's not only about his talent, you know. He also has to get a lot of radio play. The video's really gotta hit. Josh, how you doing? Uh, good. Well, this is Frank. Oh! You know Frank. He used to work for Siv. Oh. Now he has his own bakery. So, what are your plans after college? Uh, I'm thinking about training for a marathon. Here. Excuse me. You wanna take a jog over to the crudités and get me-- That's-- That's really clever. [ Susie ] Hello. And, um, Rosita. Hello. Hi. Welcome. [ Laughs ] Good. I take those. Okay. Right. Hi. I'm Anna. Hi. Oh, this is my-- my sister. Susie. Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. Yeah. Are you hungry? Yes. Can I get you something to drink? Grandma, what are you doing? Only you would know. You're not going to bed yet. It's too only. Is it? Oh. I can't. Uh-- Oh, today it's o-- Oh. It's over. Yeah. All their people were here today. Is it, um-- um-- uh-- n-n-n-not a parade? [ Laughs ] Not really. Do you know where Siv is? Siv's out. He's in heaven. Ah. I'm an angel. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] What are you doing with those socks? These socks? Nothing special. Oh, this-- this has been hiding. You want to wear it? No, no. Those are yours. I'm already wearing one. Do you want me to put it back in the sock? Uh, no, no. I want-- Um-- Let me-- Let me feel it. See? All those-- [ Voice Breaking ] All those shiny balls. You like the shape? Yeah. Yeah. They're yours. I think you've had them all your life. Mine? No, you feel-- you feel the shape now. All my life. Oh! [ Chuckles ] Oh! I'm not your woman. [ Chuckles ] I know who you are. [ Laughs ] Come-- Come downstairs with me, okay? [ Sniffles ] Here. ** [ Humming ] Come here. Watch your step. Give me your hand. Okay. One, two, three, four, five. And we're here. Okay. Stay right here. You're sweet. You're just the sweetest thing. Stay. [ Benny ] Mom, come inside. [ Whistling ] [ Guests Laughing ] [ Gasps ] Oh! [ Crackling ] Whee! [ Cheering ] Beautiful! Yeah!
