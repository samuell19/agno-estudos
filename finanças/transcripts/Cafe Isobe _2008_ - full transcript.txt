Miyasako Hiroyuki Naka Riisa Asou Kumiko Hamada Mari Kondou Haruna Dankan Wada Toshihiro Mickey Curtis Saitou Yousuke Translated by 8thSin Timed by Raku Authentic Cafe Isobe Directing / Screenplay / Editing Yoshida Keisuke - You surprised me! - You surprised me! Grandpa... died. Okay. Okay. Hello? Yes... Excuse me? Please refrain from using cell phones in the hospital. Oh, I see. Sorry. Hey, Sakiko! I'm going out to make a phone call, I'll leave the rest to you. Oh, now that I think of it... this may be the first time I've seen a dead body. Grandpa was hospitalized for 10 months... wait, 11 months. He was hospitalized for 11 months, he had already lost consciousness by the time of our first visit. I've only met grandpa... 10 times, as far as I can remember. So... I didn't really know what I felt about his death. Yes? Yes, yes. Mom... you really came. Yeah. It's been a long time. Did you lose weight? No, I gained weight. Oh. Well... I should at least pay him my respects... you contacted me too late! Want to come in? Yes. Is he here? Yes, but sleeping. I see. Oh, well. Then I'll come in. Sakiko... I can see you're in a lot of hardship... well, it's our fault... hey, where's grandpa's... you know. Over there. Oh, there it is. Are you sure you don't want me to wake him up? You don't have to. But, uh... you haven't seen him in a long time, right? Actually, I haven't see him at all since. What? How long has it been? 8... years? Huh? Oh, hi. I came without telling you. Why are you here? You've aged! Decided? Can we order? Excuse me! Hey, you can just press this button. Oh, right. It's weird we're together like this again. Oh, yeah... it seems Sakiko is doing a fine job with house work. Yeah, she is. Yeah, you probably never do anything around the house! I'm working. But Sakiko has school, and still does house work. School and work are different. Thank you for waiting, what would you like? Fisherman's Seafood Set. School and work are the same, you're just being lazy. They're completely different... - You can choose between udon or soba. Soba noodles. I'm exhausted from heavy labor. Tuna Rice Bowl for me. I mean, you already have your own family... Stop it already! It's been so long since we got together like this... Eel Rice Bowl for me. I hear you're going to get inheritance from your father. I bet it's going to tear you apart. You're... Excuse me, I'll have the Eel Rice Bowl too. The inheritance won't change me. I'm not the kind of man money could change. Uh, excuse me. You can choose hot or cold noodles. Hot. The money won't... Actually, Eel Rice Bowl please. Eel Rice Bowl, thank you. Please allow me to confirm your order. Eel Rice Bowl, Eel Rice Bowl, and Eel Rice Bowl. Is this correct? My mom's prediction came true, and dad stopped working when he got the money. He didn't tell me just exactly how much he got, but I know it's an amount that should not be obtained by someone like him. Hey, dad. Aren't you going to work? Huh? I will. It's a good thing we got the money, but you still have to work... You can still get your old job back. But... I'm thinking about a lot too. So shut up. What are you going to do? That's well... I'll let you know in a few days. Naomi, feel my pecks. What? Feel it. Okay. Do you feel it moving? Yes, it is! I'm doing heavy labor. Really? That's cool. Oh? Do you exercise a lot? Nope. I see... ...don't be mean! Then get me whatever you recommend. - Got it. Here you go. It's so cute! I'm home. Hey, welcome home. What're you making? Hmm? I'm roasting coffee beans at home. Why, all of a sudden? Well, I... have decided to open a cafe. Huh? A cafe? Yeah. What? Open a shop by yourself? Isn't that cool? What? Wait... do you have any serving experience? Not really. Right, right. Well, I don't think it's that easy. Right. I don't think it's easy, but... I think it's worth trying. More importantly, do you have a business plan? I can make one later. I don't think it's that easy. I'll work hard for it. What exactly will you "work hard" at? Huh? Dad? What? What will you work on? You're so annoying. I got it. You're annoying. So annoying. Turning a deaf ear to my warning, my dad prepared to open a cafe. Actually, the only qualification he needed was a... "Food Hygienist License"? Yeah, that's all he needed. It seems anyone who attends the 6-hour lecture can get it. They don't really have exams, just need to sit and listen to get the license... Is this system really safe? Hey! Hey there! What do you think? What? I guess there's nothing wrong with trying. It's a cafe! He'll make food and serve it to people. There's no way he can do it. Maybe he'll turn out to be really good at it. Geez! You don't care, do you? Since it doesn't concern you. I do care. Here. That's so cool! Yeah! Really? Yeah! What's wrong with it? It's a cafe, right? Yeah! You think? Let's have a party at your place next time. Is the cafe open yet? No, it's still under construction. I guess it's underway. Oh, I see. A cafe... is it going to be like Starbucks? What? Well, that's what I hope it'll be, but... I doubt it'll be that good. Oh... wouldn't it be nice if it's a cute one? So, what do you think? Should we raise it up a bit higher? No, I think it's fine. Dad! What do you think? It's starting to look like a real cafe, right? What's this? Hmm? Oh, a sign. I can see that, but... What's this "Authentic Cafe Isobe"? I thought simple is best. You gave me a lot of suggestions, but... in the end, I thought simplicity is everything, so I ended up with this one. Why did you change it without telling me? And this name is really expressive too. What's wrong with that? These names won't get old. Won't get old? It already is. What are you talking about? Change it! It's fine. - It sucks. It doesn't, right? Come on! Is this all right? Change it to the one before! Shut up, get out of the way. Hey... Hey! What's this? What the heck is this? How lame... Ugh! There's some furry stuff around the cash register... Leopard-pattern on the counter? Unbelievable. Why would he put an arcade game here? Huh? A mirror ball? What? Karaoke machine? Dad, dad... I'm Egashira, here for the interview... excuse me? Okay, find somewhere to sit. Man, it's hopeless. My back hurts... What, is the bath ready? I let the water out. What? Why? Can you stop staring? Go and fill the tub by yourself. Go! What the hell? Hey, wait! I'm in a hurry! Here. What's this? Take it with you. Original straps. I put one on too. What's with this? Nice, isn't it? I made it to celebrate the opening. Oh, I made a lot, so... pass them on to your friends. No, thanks. Take them! I can't put something so lame on my phone. Maybe one of your friends will like it. Take them. I said no! I'm going to be late. Hey... we open tomorrow, it's a Sunday, so help out. Fine. [ Grand Opening Original Strap! ] Dad, I turned the sign to 'Open'. Okay. I don't know why... there's so much sense of accomplishment! Let's take a photo as a commemoration before anyone comes. Good idea! No, come on! It's an occasion! Okay... ready? - It's an occasion! Okay. The other side is better. Oh? Let's go. Come. Ready? Oh, wait... Okay, ready? 1, 2, 3... Great! One more. Okay, get closer. Oh, zoomed in? Welcome! Take any seat you like. Sakiko! Yes? - Water, water. Yes. Uh, um... I want to work here. Uh... work? Um... we're not hiring. Oh... then... good bye. What's with him? Should I take another one? Yeah. Dad! The LED display says 'We're hiring'. What, really? What am I supposed to do? It's right behind... I can't find anything to open. There should be... I can't, it's screwed shut. It says that's the only way... Where? I know I'm supposed to push the button... Dad? It's wrong. What is? 'Delicious Coffee' is misspelt. No way. Oh, you're right. It's wrong. Geez, no customer at all. Yeah, it's the opening day, what did you expect? Maybe the sign turned to 'Closed'. It didn't. Go check. It's not! I would serve the first customer for free! Why don't we take a photo too? Good idea! 'Customer number one'! Put the photo up here in a frame, and... This bastard won't stop bothering me... Hang up already! I'm hanging up, later. Annoying punk. I've got a new plan. I told you, let's not get into anything too dangerous. We're doing it! I'm telling you, it's too dangerous! What did you say? Are you stupid? Two coffees. Beer for me. Uh, we don't serve alcohol here... Then, hot milk. Yes. You hear that? No beer. Oh. Should we take the photo? I'm going to get going. Do you want me to buy anything else? No. Okay, I'm going. Thanks. Welcome... Here you go. Uh... iced coffee, please. Iced coffee? Okay. Eh? Well, uh... This is for you. A souvenir. Thank you. Your iced coffee. What? I think we'll have leftovers. Please give these to your friends. Okay... Thank you. Uh, um... Yes? Are you hiring, by any chance? [ Authentic Cafe Isobe ] She's my daughter, Sakiko. She's Mokko, working here from today. I'm Sugawara Motoko. Oh... hello. What? What're you doing? It's going to rip! Come! Stop pulling, I'm coming. What're you doing? What's going on? What? What's with her? I told you, she's a new part-timer. I can tell from the apron! Why are you hiring more when we have no customers? I have my reasons. It's all part of my plan. That's a lie for sure. I can totally see what you're up to. Are you kidding? It's not like that... You're driving me nuts, I don't care anymore. Fine! Really? But I can't see it. Uh... yeah... It's been bothering me for a long time. I guess there's nothing I could've done. Yes, but I can't really see it. Really? What? What? What? Mokko wants to use the money saved up from this job for laser hair removal. What?! Yes. I'm really hairy, so I want to do something about it. Really? I can't really see... No, I'm really fuzzy! Huh? What? Fuzzy. Really! What, where... is... fuzzy? Lower body? It's unbelievable! You'd be disgusted by it. I probably wouldn't... What? But... it goes all the way to my stomach. Oh, uh... but... it might actually be settling. What?! That's disgusting. Really? I think it's settling. But as a woman... I mean, I... A few days later, my summer break began. I didn't really have anything to do, so I'm helping out with the shop. Um... - Yes? - Yes? Do you sell Mild Seven? The cigarette... Here. Here is your Mild Seven. Mild Seven... It's 200... 230... - It's 220 yen, right? No, it costs more than that. No way! With tax, it's... You have to label everything. How much? How much is it? Yes? - Yes? Uh, washroom... Washroom? This way... Never mind, thank you. 700... - 450 yen. 750... - Mild Seven... How much is Mild Seven? Uh... what is it? Well, yeah... What? Huh? Eh? What is it? You know, we... Yes? 800 yen per hour, right? Yes... And I checked the ads for today. Here... Another cafe, 950 yen per hour. Oh... I think it's a really good deal. Right? You know how you're over 30? No, I'm only 26... I can't pay someone like that 800 yen... It's been bothering me. Only 800 yen. No, but... I don't really mind... But you know, 150 yen an hour can make a big difference. Ah, are you saying I should quit? No, I'm not saying you should quit... You know, we don't mind, but... I'm sure you do... What happened to her? Uh, right... She says she's quitting. Huh? Why? She said she found a higher paying shop by the station. "I can get 950 yen!" She said... Oh... Really? Yeah. 950 yen an hour sounds good... Huh? Whoa... Print ads? Yeah. You got these made? A guy I know is in printing, so I asked him to make a quick one for me. Really? Wait, what do we do with these? Are we supposed to hand them out? Yeah. Sorry, can you go to the station and hand these out? What, now? Yes. Yes, I don't mind. Really? Sakiko! We probably won't get customers all of a sudden, so can you two go and pass these out? I hate these things... Come on, let's try. Fine. Then... can you handle this area? I'll pass them out in the south exit. What? We're not doing it together? No. It would be more efficient to split up, right? But... It's embarrassing... Come on, now. I'll get going. Thank you! Welcome. Hey? Sakiko? What're you doing here? Are you handing something out? It's for our shop... Oh! That coffee shop's completed? Can we go? No, there's nothing to show you... What? Show us! You're advertising. Next time, next time. Why? Come on! Right? Show us just a bit. Come on. Hey? It's the same one. Same color and stuff. Show me! Hmm... 'Authentic Cafe Isobe.' Am I reading it right? Uh... probably. What? Probably? It's your own shop. Right... What time is it? Now? 11:25. Oh. Then... I have to get going. What? Later. Thank your for waiting. Enjoy. Next please... I'm back. Hey. Did you pass them out? Why...? I think it's pointless. How can that be? They're going to throw them away without reading anyway. You should think of some other way. But... I guess so... What? I was thinking we don't have enough impact to attract customers. So... Wait here. What's that? It's this. What? Well, this is... is what I'm thinking of making our uniform. What do you think? Are you stupid? Why? Look! It's cute, right? It's not cute at all. I mean, what kind of parent forces his daughter to dress like this? Are you stupid? There's no way I'm wearing this. Actually, who would wear something stupid like this? What do you think? Oh, you're back. It's awesome! It looks really good on you! What? Really? Wow! Great! It's so cool! Right? Why don't you get changed too? No, thanks. Eh? Why? "Why"? I'll go out and advertise. Advertise? Please visit us. Please visit us. We just opened, please visit. For some reason, I was unbearably frustrated by it. What is this feeling? Stupid dad, or the easily persuaded Mokko... it just wasn't what I expected this place to be. A few days later. Mokko's actions that I looked down on... have proven to be surprisingly effective, our shop was starting to look like a real cafe. Le, le, le... lemon tea. Okay. Ready yet, dad? I'm on it now. That's the iced coffee for table 4. Okay... Thank you for waiting, your iced coffee. Thanks... hey? Are you from the Kyuushuu area? Uh, no... I'm from around here. I'm from Kumamoto. Well, my town actually borders Fukuoka... Oh, I know! Your parents must be from Kyuushuu. No, they're from here... do I have the dialect? Not at all. Have you ever been to Kumamoto? No. Excuse me, where's the bathroom? Hey, barkeeper, did this shop open recently? Barkeeper is right here. Oh, excuse me! You know, he looks more like one, right? Then, uh... Toast Set is fine. Okay, the Toast Set. Say, how old are you? 26. Oh, really? You look sophisticated. I do? Yes. Sophisticated, really beautiful too. Then, me... how old do I look? Uh... 46... Close! 45. Wait, you're 20... 6. Right, 26. You look sophisticated. Beautiful too. Right... Wait... what did you order? Excuse me, water please. Yes. Thanks. You're welcome. Well then, see you tomorrow. See you. Hey, uh... Yes? Are you hungry? Uh... not really... Eh? Are you hungry? We just ate... Not hungry? Right... see you tomorrow, then. Ah! Wanna go for a drink? I only have about an hour before the last train, if that's okay. Oh... sure. Let's go for a drink. One mackerel! Welcome! Two? Over here, please. Here we go. Welcome. Let's start with beer. Beer. Then, I'll start with beer too. Yes. Two beers! Ah! I'm so tired! What is it? Nothing. Tired! Hey, Other 26-year-olds... your friends? Are they getting married? Hmm... I don't know. I don't have many friends, so it's hard to tell. Oh. What about you, Mokko? In your future... marriage... do you have a boyfriend who you want to marry? Definitely no one I want to marry! What about a boyfriend? No boyfriend either. You don't have one? How come? I don't know why. Then... Max... what's the maximum age? By the way, I don't mind ages as long as we get along fine. What? I don't know... Not really... I don't really care about age. You don't? Oh! Really? Good morning, I'm from Sanpei Foods. Hey, The barkeeper is over here. Oh, excuse me. Frozen pilaf and... Shh... just leave it in the back. Oh, okay. Excuse me. Can I get some water? Yes. Thanks. I'm sorry! No problem. I'm sorry. Is your script wet? It's fine. I'm sorry. Uh, um... Is that a novel or something? Eh? Sorry. No, well... it's a novel, I guess... but it's nothing fancy. Wow... that's amazing. Not really. Oh, I'm sorry for using this place as a library. Not a problem at all. Please stay as long as you like. Thank you. Um... I'm not very productive at home for some reason. This place is really relaxing. Really? Excuse me. Yes. Hello, it's Yasuda. Oh, yes. Yes. I understand. Good bye. How many times does that bastard ask for water? What's the problem? Even if he only orders a cup of coffee... we have to take care of our customers. That's true, but... I just can't put up with him. What are you talking about? He's really something. He's a novelist. Novelist? Yeah, right! Watch out for him. I bet he's a pedophile. Huh? Are you nuts? Idiot, I can tell from his looks. Yeah, right. He's a sick pedophile for sure. What are you talking about? Die. No, thanks! Excuse me, I'll take your empty plate. Okay. Um... Yes? Are you... from the Kyuushuu area? No, Hokkaido. Oh, the opposite! Yes. Well... I'm from Kumamoto... but it's actually closer to Fukuoka... I see. Bye. I can't do that... Stop... no... ( mumbling ) Thank you. Hey! What's wrong? Are you okay? Are you all right? What happened to your right shoe? Ah! Where did you lose it? You're right! The bar? Not the taxi? No. I don't know. You don't know? Did you drink that much? Well... you know, I'm having my period today. So? Maybe that's it. It matters? I don't know. There's a step over there. Watch out, are you okay? I'm fine! Well, thank you so much. Right. I'm sorry, I'm drunk again. Don't worry about it. So you're fine? Yes. I'm really sorry! Then... see you. Yes. Ah... bye! Then... peace! Peace. Whoa! What's the matter? I'm sorry! When I get drunk... I'm... you know. Oh. Then... see you. Thank you. Eh? What is it? Huh? Huh? What? What? Nothing. What? Wait, what is it? Huh? What? "What" back at you! Eh? No, uh... aren't you looking at me funny? Not really. Normal, normal. Right... Hey, uh... Mokko, if you're free tonight... do you want to go drinking again... Excuse me! Yes? Can I have some water... oh, thanks. Is it going well? Yes, somewhat. Um... if you'd like... Can you tell me what you're writing about? No, it's nothing to brag about... Um... Yes? It's kind of embarrassing, but... I'm writing a story of a high school girl... but it lacks realism. I'm kind of stuck. If you don't mind, will you read it for me? Huh? I can? Of course! Anything is fine, I want some feedback from a real high school girl. That's all. Gladly! Well then, good luck. Take this. Oh, thank you. Hey, wasn't that rude? Idiot, he's the rude one for causing so much trouble over a cup of coffee. Stop being so friendly with him. Shut up! I don't want to! Ugh! Look, Mokko is being harassed. Hey, hey, hey... What, what are you... Excuse me. Are you okay? Yes. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yes. You can say no. I can? You can. Say... Sakiko? What is it? If... It's a big if, but... What? What would it be like if I got remarried? What would it be like? It would be like whatever. I see. Then, then... hypothetically... Hypothetically... Yes? If it happens, I don't want to be family with a stupid woman like Mokko. Oh? Sorry, did I make you wait long? Not at all! Is the cafe fine without you? We're not that busy, it's fine. I see. We'll have to walk a little, this way. Come on in. Excuse me. Sorry, it's messy. Sorry. Just sit wherever you like. Oh, would you like some tea? Yes, thank you. Geez, I'm nervous. Even my editor hasn't read it yet. Really? I can't wait. Excuse me. Yes, it's Yasuda. Oh, hello. Thank you. Yes. I see. Yes. Right... I think I can meet the deadline. Yes. Oh. Oh, I see. Well, you're right. It was my idea too. Oh. Yes, yes. Yes. Right. Yes, I see. Yes. You're right, yes. I agree. Yes. Yes. I agree. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Oh, I see. Right. That's a good idea. I understand. Well then, good bye. Sorry to keep you waiting. What's wrong? Oh, nothing... It was from an editor, he is so much into details. I see. I'll open the file. What should I do... What is it? Uh, um... I may have to go home for today... Why? Uh, well... I'm worried about the cafe... Are you going back? Uh... yes. Please let me read it next time... What? Why? Yes, but... Just sit down. No, but I really have to... I'm sorry. I'll come again. Hey, wait. I'm so sorry. You don't have to be sorry. My dad... is... you know. Um... can you let go of my arm? I'm so sorry! Uh, hello? Yeah, what is it? Nothing, uh... Huh? What is it? You know... uh, when do you get back? Huh? Uh... I'm a bit busy now. I want beer and... Yes, beer. Another beer? Yes, beer. - Two beers, then. What is it? Never mind. Bye. Hey, sis. Is it just me, or did they raise the price? American Coffee. Wasn't that 400 yen? Oh, you're right. Right? Couple of them are priced up. You're right, cake set too! You know Sasaki? I don't know any Sasaki... Your change is 300 yen. Thanks. Hey, hey, wait! Hey. Oh! What is it? What? Don't be like a stranger. Pick up the phone. You called me? I've called you so many times! Oh, you did? You know, I don't check call history. Stop messing with me. I want to talk. Oh... no thanks. Huh? What do you mean? Well, you know, there's nothing between us anymore... How should I put this... we don't really need to talk anymore. Wait, I guess there's nothing between us anymore, but that's what I want to talk about... Right, but it's okay. Hey, wait! Wait. Listen, it's, you know. Sorry. I don't have time... You... hey! Stop messing with me! You're really pissing me off! You know what, no one will ever take you seriously. How can you say that? You're really messed up. You really don't know how to get along with people. What? I can too. No way. You don't know how others feel. That's not true... But I'm doing fine now, so it's all right. I'm doing fine now, and I'm having fun at work. I'm doing fine, so I don't need someone who beats a woman to tell me... ...a fool like you will mess up there too. I won't! Why would you say something like that? What... What's wrong? Wait, how did you find out about this place? Well, I asked people at the bar. Oh, I see. In any case, come in. Then... you're asking around about me in the bar? A little bit. I see. Don't tell dad about me getting divorced and living by myself now. Or did you tell him already? I haven't. Oh, okay. Want something to eat? No, I'm fine. Oh... did I have something to drink? Hey, how long have you been living by yourself? 4 years ago? I guess 4 years ago. I would've come to visit if you'd told me. No, I mean... please don't tell dad about this. I won't. Mom... Yeah? Aren't you lonely by yourself? Not really. It's carefree. Right. Hey... Yes? Um... Can the three of us live together again... you think? Can't we? I'll start with beer. Start with beer. Start with beer. Start with beer. Okay. 4 beers! Welcome. Welcome. Oh! Sakiko... Oh, what's going on, Sakiko? Uh, I got hungry... I thought I'd come for some yakitori. Oh, I see. You want iced tea, right? Excuse me, one iced tea. Yes. What happened? Oh, this? My ex-boyfriend showed up last night, and bang! Poor Mokko! Unbelievable! How can he hit a girl? That's terrible. Well, you know. He must have hated me. Shouldn't you report it to the police? No, it doesn't matter. I guess it's my own fault. You think so? I don't think it's your fault. I don't know. I mean, all ex-boyfriends hit me. Are you serious? Yeah. I have a lot of reasons to be beaten. That's hard to believe. I would be kind to you! What? Really? I want someone to be kind to me! But I'm not as good a girl as you think. But then, I'm a horrible man compared to... Thank you for waiting, your iced tea. Uh... let's have a toast. Yeah, let's. Cheers! I'm going to the bathroom. It's late, hurry and eat up, and you know. Oh, right. Let's order yakitori, it's really good in here. No, thanks. I'm not really hungry. Uh, um... Have you ever been hit by a boy before? Of course not. Oh, right. Sakiko, do you have a boyfriend or someone you like? Not really. Oh... but you know, that novelist who come to the cafe all the time... Mr. Yasuda, was it? I thought you really liked him? Huh? I mean, I thought you guys were getting along well. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? I mean... Listen... Yes? What is it? Uh... Can you not get too close with my dad? Huh? What do you mean by "too close"? There's nothing between us. What? Come on! Really, I mean... I'm completely like a kid to him, I mean, he's... Shut the hell up! Yeah, I see why your boyfriend wanted to hit you. Mokko, you don't understand other people's feelings at all. Hey, about what we were talking about earlier... I think you're a good girl, Mokko. Compared to you, I'm a loser... What? I'm full of things you'd be disgusted by once you got to know me. No way! I wouldn't! Tell me, then. What? I'm really despicable. How are you despicable? Let's see... You know Mr. Ozawa, one of our customers? Ozawa? Oh! That weird dude who always sexually harasses you? I did it with him few days ago. Huh? I did it with him. You're disgusted. No, uh... I didn't know you two had such a relationship... Oh, no we don't. He asked me out... and I just couldn't say no. Oh... I just can't say no when someone asks me out... I know I shouldn't, but... well, I'm a slut. See? I'm despicable. Start with beer. Start with beer. Start with cocktail. Start with mackerel. Yes. Do you want anything? See, didn't I say you'd be disgusted? I'm not... yeah. So, I'm the worst person you can go out with. Right? It makes you sick just thinking someone like me might become your mom, right? Oh, almost time for the last train. I'll get going. Thank you, come again! Bathroom... Bathroom again. It hasn't been that long... getting old! That pedophile bastard hasn't shown up for a while. Oh... Yeah. Iced tea, please. What's going on? How did you know about this place? Huh? Look. This. Welcome. I see... It's got a strange atmosphere. Lame, huh? Yeah, but it's okay. What do you want to drink? I'll have caffe macchiato. We don't have that. Oh. Is that your dad? Uh... yeah... What? What's with her? Are those her own clothes? No... uniform. Then... do you wear that too? No way! That's tough. Is that hand-made? No, I don't think so. They sell that kind of costume? Yo. I would like... It's a uniform. Do you work late? Do you work late? I'll just have iced tea. Me too. Okay. Right, about what I was talking about earlier... Two iced tea. And Ayumi is... Dad? Oh. Then, where they can't be seen... Excuse me, sir. Huh? What? Can you stop doing things like that in the shop? Okay, got it. What? What is it? Nothing. Oh. Hey... barkeeper? Huh? What is it? Nothing. Wait, what? Nothing. Then go... go somewhere else. Ow. You... What're you doing? Dad! I'm going to call the cops! Ow! Damn you! Damn! Excuse me. I'm fine. Are you from Kyuushuu? No, I'm Portuguese. I'm from Kumamoto. Have you ever been to... I have a relative who's a cop! I really do! Why you... Ow... Ow! Ow... [ Authentic Cafe Isobe ] Excuse me, can you come to the police station with us? Uh, over here. It's me. Oh, I'm sorry! I apologize, can you come with me? Sorry. Are you okay? Wait here. Sakiko... Close the shop for today. Uh, um... I'm going to quit. Okay. Okay. Please do. Hey... let's eat stew tomorrow. Stew, huh? Stew... What? Are you bad at making that? That's not it. Aren't you coming here too often lately? Doesn't dad say anything about that? Not really. We haven't been talking lately. Oh... but you know... I'm sure he's working hard in his own way. Try to get along. What? Well, I wish I was with you. What's the point in saying that? Why? It's impossible. Why is it impossible? Because. Because what? You know, he's persistent. I fought for you back then too. I tried to get custody of you. But he said he'll never let you go. We fought so much over you. That... has nothing to do with it. I wish I was with you. Hmm... He may look like that, but I felt he cared about you more than I did. Don't you hate dad? Of course, we've had our differences. But we don't really hate each other, and I want him to be happy too. I see. He's always irresponsible and doing crazy things, but I think there's no problem with that. But... how should I put this? Excessive childishness? What's wrong with that? Way better than a boring guy who's pretending to be a grown up. You know, Sakiko... adults always want to be a child at heart forever. We want to challenge different things, and want to be in love too. Nothing different from you. I mean, I'm the same. I'm going out with a guy 9 years younger than me! Isn't that cool? Just like dad! Hey! Don't say I'm the same as him! Anyway, I'm doing fine by myself. You should stop coming here so often. Try to get along with your father. Hey, uh... - This is more than our... - Did school start yet? Did you say something? Nothing important. What is it? How's the cafe? How... normal? I see. Did your dad say something? About you? Yeah, and other things... Oh... not really. I see. Is that all you wanted to talk about? Uh... no... uh... um... sorry for... all the trouble I caused. Tonight, Hokkaido... Oh, I'm from Hokkaido, by the way. I know. Uh... I'm going back to Hokkaido. Before I leave... this... can you give this to your dad? Okay. Are you going home because of that incident? No... that's not the only reason. Well, I'm tired of a lot of things. And also this. What's this? Actually... I stole it from the cash register when I started working. What? I'm so despicable, right? Sorry. But... only 3000 yen... that's so petty. You know, it was so empty. It would be so obvious if I took any more. True. Um... This... please use this if you'd like. Thanks. How lame! Welcome back. What's going on here? Are you actually going to help out today? Kind of. Uh... Listen, I just saw Mokko. Oh, you did? And got this. She asked me to give it to you. Aren't you going to read it? No. I'm working now. Oh, right. But... she's going back to Hokkaido today. Oh, she is? She's leaving at 8 p.m. I see. Aren't you going to read the letter? I'll read it later. I had to make it with my hand... and my hand still smells like kimchi! Kimchi? That's great. Do you want me to lick your hand? Eww! No? No? I don't smell it... Stop! - I was thinking of licking it without asking! What a creep! Just wash your hands later. Dad? What? Never mind. What is it? Well... Aren't you worried about Mokko? Worry about what? I can watch the shop. If you want to go see her... I'm not going. You may be confused, but... there's nothing between us. Barkeeper! Check this out! What? What is it? Look! I got an amazing picture! What? What's this?! That's scary. - Isn't that amazing? Which angle is this? That's scary. Ugh! Nasty! Stinks! Ugh, it stinks! Mokko always did this voluntarily? I said horrible things to her, and never apologized. The barkeeper went somewhere. Oh, I think he has some business to take care of. Welcome! Let's see, 37? Huh? 37...? Coffee, please! [ Closed!! ] In the end, it seems dad came back without getting to see Mokko. He tried to convince me with a hopeless lie that he just went to buy cigarettes... Should we go home? Yes. Hey there! Don't double ride. I got warned. Yep, you did! "Don't double ride." "Don't"! "Don't"! "Hey there..." Why does he talk like that? I really can't take 2 days in row. [ 1 year later ] What? It's no problem! [ 1 year later ] What? How? [ 1 year later ] It's so tough! Don't you think? My whole body is sore! What? Don't you think? Not at all. What's with you? - Maybe it's because she never works out. - That has nothing to do with it. I don't work out either... What's wrong? Here we go. Oh, right. I have a dorayaki, want some? Look at this, isn't it huge? Let's divide it into half. Say... Huh? You went back to Hokkaido, right? Uh... yeah. But... why are you playing the slots here? Oh... right, about that... There was a mix up with the ticket on that day, so I thought "I'll just go tomorrow", and that kind of dragged on for a while... But, wait... what's with your belly? Oh... this... right, uh... you know. While I was arguing about the ticket, the train attendant... was really kind... we sort of got along well, and... What? Does that mean you're getting married? No, we're not yet, but we're living together now, so maybe soon... Oh, I see. How's the cafe? Oh, not bad, you know? A Portuguese guy is working part-time now. Oh, really? How's your dad? Is he doing well? He's himself as usual. I see. Well then, I have to help out with the cafe soon. Hey, uh... say hi to your dad for me. Okay. Sorry, actually... don't tell him you saw me. Oh, okay. Want to take this? No, thanks. I wish your baby good health. Thanks. But maybe you should stop playing slots. Yeah, you're right. Bye. Bye. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Actually, the cafe went out of business soon after that incident. Well, it wasn't properly managed anyway. To be honest, we weren't serving real food. Really... mediocre. I guess it was a good thing he realized it early. Besides, such an embarrassing cafe... I'm glad... it's gone. I'm really glad... Dad, is the pilaf ready yet? I'm on it now... starting today, Mokko. I'm Sugawara Motoko. Are you from Kyuushuu? Excuse me, water please. Take any seat you like. Sakiko! Yes, water, water. Are you kidding? It's not like that... I don't care anymore. Fine! Really? Wow! What's this "Authentic Cafe Isobe"? Hey! What are you doing? It's your daddy! Huh? What's going on? No way! Were you crying? I wasn't. Yeah, you were! Was not! What were you doing then? Nothing really... Right... Oh, I just met... Yeah? Never mind, sorry. What is it? Huh? Tell me. I don't want to. Nothing, never mind. - You started saying something, tell me! No, I can't take that. You're persistent, it's nothing! I'm curious, tell me! You're persistent! It's going to bother me the whole day. Later! Tell me, hey! Wait! No! Idiot! Stop following me! Excuse me. Hey, wait! Stop! Come on! You made me curious! I don't want to tell you! Fine. I won't ask anymore. I'll stop asking. I won't ask anymore, just tell me... No... One thing I want to ask you is... have you ever kissed anyone before? Are you dumb?
