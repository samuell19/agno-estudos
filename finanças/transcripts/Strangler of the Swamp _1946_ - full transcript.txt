[upbeat music] [intense music] [haunting music] [frogs croaking] [haunting music] - [Joseph] Can I be of anymore help? - [Christian] No thank you Joseph, we'll handle it. [frogs croaking] [haunting music] - Who is it Christian? - Bill Craig, drowned. - Poor Louise, her only son. - Bill Craig, but I saw him only this afternoon, he was going swimming, where did you find him?! - In the swamp near the ferry, only his legs were sticking out. We had a hard time to get him loose. - How dreadful. The noose! - Quiet, quiet I say. Can't you see you fools?! There's only a few vines and roots around his neck, nothing else! - It's a perfect noose for anybody who can see! It's the Strangler again! - Oh don't be silly, look. - You see! - If the County Council had listened to me they would have allotted money to drain the swamp, this wouldn't have happened! - Draining the swamp would never drive away the Strangler, it's not that easy to get rid of him. - Right there isn't any Strangler! He exists only in your own superstitious mind. - Is that so?! Then why did you send your son to the city never to return? It's because you know you're all marked men, you and Chris and Joseph and my husband. - Oh you're crazy! Sanders, Jeffers, carry the boy to his home, I'll go ahead and inform his mother. [melancholy music] - It was the Strangler got Bill. - Everything is coming true as he said it would, word for word, let's go and take down that cursed rope. - Yes. [eerie music] [metal clanks] [frogs croaking] [eerie music] - Whose there? - [Martina] Martina Sanders. - What are you doing here at this time of night? - Just take us across to the other side Joseph. [eerie music] - They found Bill Craig tonight, a noose around his neck. - I saw Bill but I didn't see anything like a noose. - The Strangler got him. - You'd believe anything wouldn't you? Why doesn't he visit me? I live closest to his grave. - He will, you too are a marked man. - I'd like to see that old drunken card sharp again. - He was all that yes and no good but was he a murderer? - [Joseph] Of course he was, everyone knows that. - It was your testimony that hanged him Joseph, he offered an alibi. - If only you had listened to the few who didn't agree but no you had to act quickly. He just couldn't die fast enough for your crazy raid. - And you got what you always wanted didn't you Joseph? His ferry. - What do you mean? - Nothing, nothing. - Then hold your tongue. [foreboding music] - [Christina] That eviler noose was made when they found Farmer Berkeley murdered in his field and they accused ferryman Douglas of the crime and hanged him. He screamed that he was innocent, but that didn't stop them. It was then that he spoke the curse. Joseph why have you let that rope hang here all these years? - [Joseph] It serves as a warning. - A warning, to who? Joseph we're going to take that down! - [Joseph] No, it stays there! Since that's been there there hasn't been anymore trouble. - There's been more trouble then ever since it hangs there, have you forgotten Bill Jenkins who was thrown from his horse and choked to death by the reins? - And Shelton, strangled by the pulley rope as he fell from his hayloft. - And Henry Craig, throttled by his fishnet. - And tonight his son Bill choked to death by the weeds. - What's Bill Craig to do with it? He wasn't even at the hanging. - Have you forgotten Douglas' vow that he'd return to strangle all of his hangmen and their descendants for generations to come. - He's become a scourge, sparing none of our men. - Nonsense, nonsense I say! You're a bunch of superstitious old women, the rope remains where it is. [gasps] [frogs croaking] - A sign from heaven. - Nonsense, the rope was old, rotten. It just fell down. - It was a sign from heaven, a sign for you to make the sacrifice. - [Christina] And lift the curse - And save the others, yes Joseph heed it, give yourself willingly into the hands of the Strangler and his curse will be broken forever. - You must be insane women, sacrifice! Where did you get that silly idea? - Jenkins told me before the Strangler got him, he said only the sacrifice of one of you or your kin could break the curse. Jenkins was a wise man, he knew a lot about these things. - Then why didn't he make the sacrifice? - He thought about it but he waited too long. - Sacrifice, ridiculous. I'm only 70, that's not old for a man. I've plans for the future, my grandchild will come, take over the ferry and I'll have time to do what I always wanted, plant sugarcane. - Oh you're all like that. [metal clanks] - Only noble men are willing to give their lives to save others, you're all small, that's why the curse will never be lifted. Good night Joseph! [melancholy music] [metal clangs] [haunting music] [frogs croaking] [haunting music] [intense music] - Hello. - [Douglas] Yes Joseph. Yes. - Douglas! Have you, have you risen from the dead? [frantic music] What are you going to do? Frighten me? I know its just a trick of my imagination. But how is it I can see you? Where do you come from? - [Douglas] From my grave in the swamp. Whenever the heart or soul of a cursed one or filled with anguish to the brim I appear. Tonight it is your soul that calls. - You can't be there! You're not real! - [Douglas] Your guilty conscious is real, the rope you hanged me with is real. [intense music] [screams] [splashing water] [eerie music] [birds chirping] - Poor old Joseph didn't leave much. - No. - There were two pairs of trousers. - Describe them. - One dark, good shape. One grey, worn I'd say. - Grey, thread bare, go on. - One, two, three, four, there's six shirts, that's all that's here. - Six shirts. You're very obliging Jeffers to help me with this inventory. - Thank you Christian, I'm always glad to lend a hand. - I've been thinking for some time of getting you set with something more solid, more substantial then just odd job. Now we have something for you. - Me? Oh I sure thank you Christian for thinking about me. - I was talking to the Council this morning about you, they put up quite an argument but finally they gave in. - They know whose boss, don't worry. - Yes Jeffers now you're the new ferryman. - Oh no, not for a million dollars. - What? - Nothing could make me spend even one night here. - Well you're a coward. - I don't care what you say, I am afraid! But so are all the others. - Why Anna's influenced you, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. - Well I can think for myself, I have my own theories. Where, for instance, is the rope we found around Joseph's neck? It was by the body when we brought him into the village square, then it was gone. Things are not natural. - Oh somebody took it maybe, maybe one of the children to play with it! - Or the Strangler. - Oh you make me sick, lets go on to the inventory. [thump] - Oh look here's some letters and papers. - Well here put 'em in here, I'll look at 'em later. Now how about shoes and boots? - Well. Christian, look! Someone on the opposite shore. [soft music] - Here, do you know her? - Never saw her before. [soft music] - Hello Mr Sanders. - Why Maria. - That's right. - Here let me take your bag. Well you were such a little girl, I'd forgotten all about you. It must be 10 years ago that you were here. - Where's Grandfather? - Oh come in and sit down. - What's wrong? Has something happened to him? - Well Maria he wasn't young anymore, he was past 70. - Is he dead? - [Christian] Yes. - When did it happen? How? - He had a very easy death Maria, just slipped over into a better world. We buried him three days ago. It was a nice funeral, all the villagers were there to say goodbye. Oh I know how you must feel Maria, why don't you come and stay at my house for a few days. At least until everything is alright. - You're very kind Mr Sanders. - I hope you won't find the bed too hard, when Chris left home he was just the age when boys think they can become strong only by denying themselves every comfort. - I'm not spoiled. - Are you sure you're doing the right thing Maria? - I think so. - But Maria running the ferry is awfully hard work and not for a woman. - I'm only doing what I think Grandfather would have wanted and Mr Jeffers and Mr Sanders thought it was a good idea. Said I'd have more customers then I could handle. You see being all alone, work in the city, well it isn't much fun and as far as the work being hard, I can do it, I'm strong. - But you'll still be living alone and so far out. - I know but it won't be the same 'cause it'll be mine. I'm not afraid. - No young people never are. But I'm afraid. - Why, of what? Everyone seems so nice. - Oh you'll think I'm just a superstitious old woman but the swamp, the things have happened out there that are not natural. - I don't believe in the supernatural. - But the danger is real. Oh don't think I'm trying to give you bad dreams or that I'm trying to frighten you away, I'm not. I like you dear but I just couldn't bare to see you go out there without giving you a warning dear. - You're very nice Mrs Sanders, thank you so much. - Well I guess I'd better be going downstairs, Mr Sanders will be through with his meeting now. Goodnight Maria, sleep well under our roof dear. - Thank you, goodnight. - Well Christian I don't see any harm has been done, the girl wants to be our new ferryman. The only danger I can see is in loneliness. - It isn't a question of danger, I didn't tell her the whole truth about the death of her Grandfather because I wanted to soften the shock. All I ask of you and your women is to keep quiet. I'll tell her the truth when the time comes. - I think you did right Christian, it wouldn't have made her feel any better. - Well I guess that's all I wanted to say. - Well goodnight Christian. - Goodnight Joe. - Goodnight Christian. - Goodnight Tom. - I'd like to stay a minute if its alright. - Yeah. - [Pete] Christian I'm sure the Strangler took him. - [Christian] Took what to who? [haunting music] - I can't eat, I can't sleep. I just wait for the Strangler to get us like he got Joseph. - Now that is just nonsense, Joseph Hart committed suicide, I found proof among his papers. Here read this. - A confession, that he killed Berkeley in a quarrel. And gave wrong testimony. "And cowardly enough I accused ferrymen Douglas, "but believe me neighbors and friends I haven't "had one peaceful hour since." Christian, that means that we, we hanged an innocent man. - We are guilty of acting too hastily, but what's done is done. And all our regrets won't bring a hanged man back to life. - But he is back! He walks among us and kills us, one by one. [eerie music] [frogs croaking] [eerie music] - Now you can do no harm, in this sacred place your power is broken. [melancholy music] [sighs] Dear Father, the little girl in our home, keep her safe from all harm. - Can't the village afford to have it's own doctor instead of bothering you every time? [laughs] - They're too sturdy, they simply won't get sick. A doctor would starve here. - Only from time to time they get their necks broken, don't they Doc? - Very true my boy, accidents and occasionally a child birth, the only thing they ever need me for. Goodbye Maria. - Goodbye Doctor. - Hurry George, pick up the bags, come along. - Bye. [sweet music] [thumping] - Hey you! Can't you signal when you want to get across?! - Well don't get excited, I'm not trying to steal it. [sweet music] Just sit down, I'll pull it over. - It's my boat, I get paid for doing it. - You're independent aren't you Maria? Mother wrote me about you. - Your mother? - Martina Sanders, I'm Christian Sanders Junior. - Alright Junior just sit down and don't rock the boat. - Well don't call me Junior, I don't like it. Call me Chris. - Alright Chris. [sweet music] - Same smell of swamp water, I missed it. I've been pretty homesick for the last three years. - You've come home to stay? - Yep, gonna be a farmer like my Dad. - Your father's a very important man here. - Sure. - Sometimes I'm afraid of him, he's so stern, so sure of himself. - Well you don't know him, he's soft as butter, I can wrap him around my little finger. Met any of the boys around here yet? - A few. - Guess they're hanging around here all the time huh? - Oh no they're much too nice. - Oh bashful, well that's good. That's very good. I'll be seeing yah. - You know Chris I worry every moment when you're home, I long to see you dear but why did you have to come home? Why? - Well I love it here more than anyplace in the world. I belong here. - Chris' right, it'll stop all the stupid rumors and gossip. - Don't worry Mother. I believe in what you yourself taught, we're in the hands of the almighty and nothing can harm us. - Chris, you're not going out, it's your first evening at home. - I'm just going out with some of the fellas. - [Christian] Well don't stay out too late son. - Alright Dad. - A fine boy your son Mrs Sanders, the girls will be crazy about him at the Halloween dance. - Say, how'd you like to go to Halloween dance with me? - Oh that will be a busy day for me. - Every year I win all the prizes, I'm the best dancer around here. - I don't doubt it, I'm sure I'd enjoy it but who would bring all the guests across? - That's crazy, such a pretty girl worrying about her job. Say you should marry, have a nice home. - I'm happy as I am. - Maybe so but you need protection. You think I'm kiddin', well listen I'll tell you what nobody else in the village has dared tell you because they're afraid to let you in on a secret of the Vilalge. Yep the big secret, of a Strangler, who roams around and kills people. - Alright George you tell me your story another time. - No I'll tell you right now. You are in danger believe me. - I can see that. - What's the matter with yah? Run away from me eh? [fist smacks] I guess I'll a little pickled, I'm sorry. - That's alright. - You better go home and sleep it off. - Thank you Chris. - Next time he gets fresh push him overboard. - I will, goodnight. - Now you go in first and lock the door. [sweet music] - Goodnight Chris. - Maria. - Yes? - Is it alright if I stop around now and then? Just to see if everything's alright. - You'll find me right here, I can't very well get away. - Alright I'll see you tomorrow then. - Goodnight Chris. [sweet music] [intense music] - [Marina] Are you still awake Chris? - Yes Mom, come on in. - I saw Mrs Ryan today Chris, she's peeved because you haven't called on Margaret once although you've been home almost a month. It's really not polite. - Margaret bores me. - I thought you liked her, you two were. - I've outgrown that. - Oh Chris, look at these dirty shoes, you've been in the swamp again. I plead with you day in and day out and you won't listen. Death waits behind every bush and tree. - No Mother, somebody very beautiful and lovely. - Maria? Have you seen her often? - Yes I didn't like the idea of her being out there in the swamps alone. - She's a very courageous girl. - And sweet. - Are you in love with her Chris? Seriously? - Very much. - Oh Chris, keeping a secret from your mother, what kind of a son are you? Did you tell her? - No. - Why not? - Well I just can't seem to get up the courage. - Now that's a new side to your character. - Well honest Mom it isn't as simple as you think, I just can't seem to get the right chance. And then there are times I think she might turn me down. - Why should she? You're a handsome boy, come from a good family and well, if I were a young girl I'd be waiting for you to speak up - Well I hope she is. So how did Dad pop the question? - Well that was different, you see we'd known each other since childhood and we'd always taken it for granted that we'd marry each other. - Well that is different. - Let your heart tell when the right moment comes Chris, the fewer words the better then dear. [hammering] - There, now you won't fall through. Penny for your thoughts. - The swamp makes me think of fairy tales, so lovely. Any minute you expect beautiful old legends to come to life. - Well at least somebody doesn't see evil spirits running around. - You know I almost did last night. - Why? - In the middle of the night I heard the signal, I ran down and pulled across to the other side. No one was there so I called out and there wasn't any answer. So I started back. - And? - Well I had the strangest feeling that someone was standing behind me. - Look Maria you just can't stay out here at night any longer, I won't. - Chris, what do you think I found this morning? A little dead bird lying near the plow shed, in the night it must have flown right into it. - Well it's an explanation but believe me Maria you can't stay out here at night any longer. You've got to give up this ferry business. - I like my job Chris, what else could I do? - Marry me? I love you Maria. - Oh Chris. - I love you very much. [romantic music] [gasps] - Christian the Strangler almost got me, I saw him, I heard his voice. - Now come come come come, don't be a fool, pull yourself together! What happened? - I was coming home through the swamp, suddenly I saw a shadow and started running. I stumbled on a tree root and clammy wet fingers grabbed me by the throat, I heard his devilish laugh and then he was gone! I'll never forget it as long as I live. [laughs] - When you fell you got caught in a few wet twigs that's all. Can't you reason anything out? - Oh maybe I am crazy, but I just can't stand it any longer, I feel the rope hanging over us. You're so sure of yourself, you know everything don't you? But let me tell you Christian, there's only one way out for all of us, sacrifice! - Sacrifice? - One of us must give himself voluntarily into the hands of the Strangler to break the curse. - You're willing to try anything aren't you? - Christian let me talk to you as one who admires you, thinks highly of you. - Come to the point. - You're rich and respected, you've accomplished everything that men can expect of life. - And? - The village would always remember you, would treasure your memory if. - If? - If you could bring yourself to make that sacrifice. - So you can sleep at night? - Yes. - Wouldn't it be more logical to save the greatest success in town, me, as you so nicely said and sacrifice the greatest fool, you Jeffers, wouldn't that be more logical? If one of us has to jump in the swamp it's going to be you and if the Strangler doesn't get you then pneumonia will! Now get out, go on, get out! Get out you crack pot! All this swamp breeds more rumor then mosquito. I'm going to call a village council together and do something about it and at once. We'll dry it up and build a road across it. - But you haven't any money. The County turned down your application for funds. - Well I'll find a way, I'll use the church funds to begin with. - Christian, you won't dare. That money is pledged to build a church of our own, these poor people saved it penny by penny. - Well they'll see the importance of my plan. - Nothing is more important in any community then a church. Christian, is it possible that you too deep in your heart are afraid of the swamp? - That's the most ridiculous statement I ever heard. I'm going over to see Cob and I'll be late for dinner. [romantic music] - I've got it all planned. Tomorrow night you put on your best dress and I'll come out and get yah. We'll go over and see Mom and Dad and when we get their blessings we can announce the engagement at the Halloween party. - But what about the ferry? - Forget about the ferry. - How could I Chris? It's been too much like my life, going back and forth from shore to shore. Never resting, never stopping. And I'll never forget that it brought us together. Being here with you, looking into your eyes, for the first time in my life I know what it means to be home. - Maria. - Chris. [romantic music] [intense music] - [Christian] Jeffers! - Don't try to stop us, we've made up our minds! - I wasn't talkin' to you! - She's right, we don't want to spend another hour in this cursed village, we're leaving for good. - Oh you coward. - Get out of my way, come on! [wheels clanking] - Where's old Jeffers goin? - Oh he's running away from the curse. - Poor man scares as easy as a rabbit. - Ugh. Sit down Son, you're home early tonight for a change. I haven't seen very much of you the last few days. - Well I guess you know where I've been spending most of my time. - Yes I think I do, as a matter of fact it's had me a little worried. - Well you can forget it, we're getting married. I'm bringing Maria over tomorrow night to meet her new mother and father. - I wish I could give you my blessing Son but I can't. Her grandfather Joseph Hart is a murderer. - What? - He killed Berkeley. - Well you can't mean it. - Every word of it, I found his confession after he committed suicide. - Suicide, well does Maria know this? - [Christian] No I didn't tell her about it. - Well I don't see why Maria should suffer for a crime her grandfather committed. She's as innocent as I am. Or as guilty. - [Christian] Oh now don't get excited son. - Why not? There's a murderer in my family. - Chris! - You helped in the mobbing and hanging of Douglas, for a crime somebody else had committed. - We had the word of Joseph Hart that Douglas did it, Joseph alone bares all the guilt. - Everybody shares in the guilt of that hanging, including you and me. - Nonsense, you weren't even there. - The sight of Maria fills your righteous heart with hard because she's kin of a bad man, then that same hard should shake you every time you look at me because you're no different then Joseph Hart! - Chris you've said enough! Don't bring that girl in this house. - Then I won't be here tomorrow night either, goodnight. [sweet music] [crash] [shout] [foreboding music] - Chris! [intense music] [door slams] - Strangler! - What is it Chris? - I saw his face. - Whose face? - The face of the man they hanged. Took the short cut. - Yes darling and ran into deer trap. - It was the Strangler. - Don't speak, don't be afraid. Close your eyes and I'll hurry for Dr McDaniel. I'll be right back. [frantic music] [foreboding music] - [Douglas] Chris is doomed, a doctor cannot help. He will die. Once this boat was mine. - I know now. What are you going to do? - [Douglas] Make sure he dies. - Don't don't. [foreboding music] [frantic music] He's gone! - He shall not escape. [foreboding music] - [Maria] Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! [frantic music] Chris! Chris! - Maria. - Chris! - Maria. - Is Christian going to try and talk the people out of their church fund in his Halloween speech? He can't do it can he Martina? - He certainly will try. - We won't let him. - I want a roof over my head when I pray. [frogs croaking] - Tonight I shall tell you of my plan to enrich our farmland by draining the swamp. Naturally a project like this costs money, since our village isn't wealthy each of us will have to make sacrifices. - Is Chris here? - You should know better then I where Chris is, bursting into this house. - The Strangler's after Chris. - [Christian] What are you saying? - The Strangler caught him in a deer trap! - Is he dead? - He was almost dead when I found him. - Where is he? - I don't know, I was running for the doctor when the Strangler stopped me. - Well never mind the Strangler, where is Chris? - I took him to the hut and then he was gone. Oh if he's in the swamp the Strangler. - Tell Mrs Sanders, tell the others, tell them to start a search! I'll go ahead, no whoever finds Chris first will take him across to the doctor, do you understand? - Yes! - Alright! - [Douglas] Let the old run, I'll get him too! Don't move, stay here and tell no one. [frantic music] There is no help for him. No matter where you go I'll stop you. I'll deafen their ears to you. Run run you little fool! Run til your heart bursts. - You shall not touch him as long as I live. [melancholy music] - [Christian] Chris! Chris! Chris! [haunting music] Chris! Oh Chris! Chris, Chris! Oh you'll be alright my son, I'll get you to the doctor. [frantic music] [eerie music] [frantic music] - Run for the old chapel, he can't follow there! The church! [frantic music] [foreboding music] - My darling, my darling. - The Strangler. - We're safe here in the chapel. - [Douglas] There is no escape, he will die. - I'll wake the village, they'll bring help, we must destroy him. - He's dying, he's dying. - [Douglas] He's dying. [foreboding music] - He will not die, no no, he cannot die. - [Douglas] Nothing can save him. - I can save him. [melancholy music] - [Christian] Don't Maria, don't cross the threshold. We've safer on the inside, don't cross. [melancholy music] - Your cruel hands shall not touch him anymore. I give myself willingly into your hands, take me. [intense music] Give up the fight, leave the vengeance to the almighty, make peace with him. Make peace with him, leave the living alone. [intense music] [soft music] - Maria I can breathe again. - He's gone Chris, he's gone forever. [triumphant music]
