Just trying to avoid drillmaster Eismayer. And why the toothpaste? Didn't you go to school? Sure. A toothpaste fever is your ticket to the sickbay. Why are you so scared of him? Yeah, fuck Eismayer. We'll see who's laughing tomorrow. You haven't heard the stories? Once during a drill the dude nuked a cow with a fucking bazooka. He's a total psychopath. He's a walking corpse. He's had a thousand cancers. Cancers? Moron. He won't even die. Once he even killed a recruit. Made him do push-ups in the shower. Cold, warm, cold, warm, cold, warm. Guy died of a heart attack. Yeah, right. He'll fuck you for breakfast. Uh huh. Yeah. What's going on here? Why are the lights still on? Line up in front of your bunks. Let's go! Get up. Everyone in the room, line up, move it!

And your shirts, mommy folds them at home, right? Yes. Shoeshine shit! What was wrong with it? Excuse me? Is there a problem? I was just asking what was wrong. 20. Why? 40. What was... 60. Don't you get when to shut up? 60 push-ups. Today in class you learned how to render courtesy. Didn't you? What did you do there? Jerk each other off? Are you funny? Maybe he didn't get it because he's a foreigner. Get up. I'm only at 24. I said get up! Are you a retard, Recruit Ali Baba? Sergeant Major, sir, Recruit Falak reports: my name is Falak. He's a fast learner. Eyes front. Are you an intelligent Ali Baba? Yes, Sergeant Major, sir. Organize lockers. Five minutes. Yes, Sergeant Major, sir. You heard him: organize your lockers. Five minutes. Charlie. Hey, you're still up? I'm watching a movie. What are you watching? Jungle Camp. Who's the champ at jungle camp? You're watching that crap? When are you coming? Something came up, I've gotta stay here. Did something happen? Nothing serious, but I gotta stay, like it or not. Well, see you tomorrow. Kisses. Bye. Alright, gentlemen, the next six months won't be fun. They'll be tough. But this is the cream of the crop. The Fourth Guards Company I don't give a shit if your daddy is a CEO or a Yugo. I care about performance. The choice is yours. You're a slacker? I will destroy you. I will crush you into tiny pieces. Or You perform. Then I'll wipe your asses. I'll fucking wipe your asses if you perform. What's wrong Schober? Need a shit? No, Staff Sergeant, I'm sick. Staff Sergeant. Recruit Buresch reports. I got it from him. Use a rubber when practicing comradely intercourse. Schober, breathe on me. You call that breathing on me, Schober, huh? I need you to breathe on me nice and hard. Let's go, breathe on me. Buresch, you too, breathe on me. Go on. I'm only going to say this once. If one of you assholes eats toothpaste or deliberately makes himself unfit for service in any other way, then, I swear, I'm gonna go postal! And now the good news. In the Guards Battalion nobody gets left behind. We are the Fourth Guards Company! We represent our army! Heya-heya-heya-ho! Put me down. I'll manage. Dude! You're such assholes. Stop! You're gonna pay for this, I swear. Having a gout attack or what's wrong? Sergeant Major, sir, I have a stabbing pain... Dead. On the ground, dead man! On the ground, what's wrong? Completely dead. I said completely dead! Honor Guard! Order arms! Honor Guard! Right shoulder arms! Come in. Honor Guard. Order arms! What is it? Sergeant Major. No. Come in. Stand there. And now report correctly. Sir, Recruit Weber reports you are to report to Captain Karnaval immediately. Boy, say "immediately" to me again and I'll whack you. Yes sir, Sergeant Major! Sergeant Major. Captain. Alright, let's cut to the chase. Hard-asses like you are why no one wants to join the army. That's a problem. All they have to do is follow the rules. Your rules. This isn't the 80s or the 90s, and I won't tolerate it. It's time you accept that. Hey! Dad! Hey, big guy, what's up? Look. Wow. What's that? A family portrait. No. They're monsters. Great. Who's hungry for Schinkenfleckerl? Yay, Schinkenfleckerl! Look at this funny bird on here. Niki, go wash your hands please. I already did. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. You didn't. I did. Wash your hands. Chopchop. After dinner I'll show you what I found, ok? We need to book fast, before the seats are gone. Do you know when your vacation is? Can we do it tomorrow? I have to go back to the barracks today. What am I supposed to do? Can you put some water on, please? You promised. We'll book tomorrow, okay? Okay? Does anyone know where we're going? We're going to war. Moron. Alright! Fourth Guards Company, dismount! Are you crazy? Who gave you permission to drive up here? Don't get worked up, it's bad for your blood pressure. Eismayer. I need you like a hole in the head. Marder, show them their quarters. Alright, gentlemen. Get going! Take your gear to the quarters, over there. What's with you, Dopey? March. Take cover! Second element, close ranks with the first! Prepare to leap. Leap! Charge! Take cover! Keep your heels glued to the ground. A sniper will blow them off from 300 meters away. Prepare to leap! Leap! Charge! Take cover! I'm not tired. Brush your teeth and then you can watch one episode. But only one. Okay? Really? Mom! Dad said I can watch another episode. Bye! Byebye! Bye-bye! Byebye! Hello. Hi. How's it going? Fine. Same as always. Hold on a sec. Don't touch me, you faggot. Oooh. Son of a bitch! Call my mother a bitch again and I'll kill you. Fucking faggot! Falak, enough! Marder, report. Sergeant Major, sir, I just told him not to use all the warm water. And then he tells... What?! To join him in the shower. Is that true? Yes, so what? He even had a boner. Outside in full combat gear in five minutes. You're running a lap of honor, Falak. Yes, sir. Lap of honor. We are the Fourth Guards Company! We represent our army! I said full combat gear! No matter how fast a tank runs, it always gets hit by our artillery guns! To your rooms! Dismantle arms and clean them until taps. If you freeze to death, I'll kill you, Falak! Fairies never freeze, Sergeant Major, sir. You pretentious asshole! Falak! I'd never have guessed he was a faggot. Falak! Hey, you jerk! But now that I know... The army's no place for fags. It's like putting a pedophile into a kindergarten. Let's go! Any of you sissys can't swim? Very good. Any chickenshits? Anyone allergic to water? What's wrong? Good. Put on your climbing harnesses. You heard him, boys. Backpacks off, harnesses on. Let's go, move it! And help each other. What do you think, how far down is it? Come on Falak, your turn. Come on, Mario! Come on, Falak! What's the problem? Sir, I'm not going. What do you mean? Are you fucking with me again? You're crossing over now. I can't do it. How's it going on the other side? Fuck off, Striegl! Come on Falak, don't shit your pants. Falak, if you don't cross over now, you'll always be the chickenshit faggot. You realize that, right? Falak, what's it gonna be? You want that? Come on, Falak, come! You can do it. Come on now. Falak. Come on, Mario! You can do it, Mario! You're doing great. Just don't look down, Falak. Just step onto the rope. Mario, do it! Come on! Go on! Falak! Fuck this. Are you crazy? Falak! You're a hero now. March! Halt! Come in. Recruit Weber reports that Captain Karnaval wants to see you in his office. Sergeant Major, please, take a seat. Hello Charles. Hello Kurt. Recuperated? Thank you. Very well. We'll take the minutes at this meeting. This is about the incident during field exercises at the Seethal Alps training area. Parties involved: Sergeant Major Charles Eismayer and Recruit Mario Falak. Please tell us what happened in your own words. We followed our route as scheduled, but then... No, I don't mean your stunt. I'm talking about the incident on December 17 at 9:30 pm. Eyewitnesses say you pushed Recruit Falak brutally against the wall and then sent him naked into open terrain. Please describe the incident from your own perspective. Corporal Mader and Recruit Falak started to fight. The situation escalated, which is why I briefly pinned Recruit Falak against the wall. And what happened then? Nothing? Then Recruit Falak ran out naked. But against my orders. Sergeant Major, do you know what led to the fight? No. You don't know. Excuse me for being blunt, but have you got something against homosexuals? Excuse me for intervening. Scratch that question from the records. With all due respect, Colonel, but Recruit Falak outs himself and then he is sent naked... It was insubordination. And later it's the same recruit whose carabiner opens. What do you want from me? Gentlemen, let's all calm down again. After all, nothing happened, well, nothing serious. Everybody is fine. Our instructors are in the newspapers. "Heroic Rescue" And as far as I know, Falak did not file a complaint, right? No. Well then, it's all good. Case closed, let's have lunch. Bon app√©tit. You were brave, Charlie. Captain. Sergeant Major. You're walking in a minefield. One false step... And boom. Honor Guard, at my command! Attention! Shoulder one! Two! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Stop! Out of my way! Listen up, you slackers. The object of this exercise is a simultaneous shouldering. The unisono, hard thud when positioning the rifle. This here sounds like whores playing with their beef curtains. I want to see one decent shouldering. Then you'll be dismissed for the weekend. Perfect unity, just once. Honor Guard, on my command! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Too sluggish! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Tempo three! Arms! Three! Three! Three! Nagl, what's wrong? Sir... Are you in love with me? You want my picture? Eyes front! So, Nagl, what's wrong? I can't move my arm, sir. It's always something. This hurts, that's too tight. I can't do this, I don't like that. I just want one fucking simultaneous shouldering. Or is that asking too much? One more mistake and your parents get a letter saying: "He died for his fatherland." Arms! Tempo three! What's wrong? Where have you been? At the barracks. I called there. They said you had already left. Where were you? Charlie? I'm going to Maria's. I want Daddy to come, too. What's the score? 40 days more! Cheers! Dammit! What's he doing here? One of these days, I swear, I want to see him really get burned. You know what I heard? That the guy is, sorry, a fag. Yeah sure. Really? Yes. The Eismayer? There are some recruits who he has literally fucked. If you do things properly, he leaves you alone. I think he's tough but fair. A hundred euros if you go give him a kiss. I dare you. You are so stupid. If you do that... If you give Eismayer a kiss, fuck it, I'll give you my entire month's pay. Now that's an offer... Yeah, alright, me too! What about you, stingy? Oh man. Alright, I'm in, let's go. Is he crazy? Falak, don't be stupid. What is it, Falak? Recruit Falak reports he wants to give you a kiss. I beg your pardon? It's a bet. If I give you a kiss, I'll get five month's pay. We can split fifty-fifty. Whose terrific idea was this? Yeah, that's what I thought. Well, then I'm getting a kiss from each of you. Except you, Falak, I'm afraid you'll have to watch. Yes, sir. Right here. Ew! That guy's a psychopath, right? I hate to say it but that was pretty gay. Easy for you to say. Come in. Sergeant Major, sir, Recruit Falak reports as ordered. You want to enlist? Yes, Sergeant Major, sir. Why? What do you mean, why? I assume you know why you want to join the army. Why do you ask... Rest! Or I kill you. Eyes front. Do you ask because I'm a Yugo or because I'm gay? Different matter: I hear you're good with electronic stuff. Is that right? Yes, sir. I need someone to hook up my TV. My address. Tonight, when you get off duty. That's all. Bye. Sargent Major, sir, Recruit Falak signs off. Yes? Sergeant Major, sir. Second floor, the door's open. Shoes off, I just mopped the floor. Don't. Sit. You hungry? I made dinner. Meat loaf. I have beer, too, if you want. What about the TV? Eat first, work later. I'm actually not really hungry. Of course you're hungry. Beer? Yes, Sergeant Major, sir. Charles. In here you'll call me Charles. Charles? Dude, you want your ears boxed? Cheers. Cheers. You won't make it to the barracks tonight, you'll stay here. I'll write you a permit and deal with the duty officer. Okay? Good night. Night. Towel's in the bathroom. Where's my spring? Who the fuck has my spring? Falak, is there a problem? Someone stole my spring. Has anyone seen Mr. Falak's spring? No. Suck my dick! Falak, halt! What's wrong? Nothing. The guys just teased him a little bit. Then he flipped out because this time he wasn't the fastest. It's probably his time of the month. You have nothing under control! So, have you calmed down? Why do they give me a hard time? You give them a hard time. You're currently at the top of the asshole list. Mario, you can only be effective if you're in control of yourself. To be in control you need order in your locker, head and body. You understand? But I'm faster. Mario! I know I can be faster. Stop talking. Just do it! Mom, stop, stop, stop! There's the swing. Yes. Come. Come, let's go. Come! Are you coming? You go on ahead, we'll be right behind you. I bat for the other team. What? I'm gay. Always have been. You know what my mom said back then? Just don't talk about it. It will pass. Father never looked me in the eye again. 'Til the day he died. They sent me to the military. To Hierzberger. "To make a man out of you, Charlie." When my brother set us up... I was so fascinated by you. That you took an interest in me. I really thought I was healed. Daddy, come on already! Come on! Guys. Guys! Since it's your last day, when you get off duty, you'll strip the beds and clear the lockers. Turn your weapon and your other gear in to the sarge. Your piss-soaked sheets, I'm not gonna name names, Polat, you take to the laundry. At 5 this afternoon down at the field we'll have a barbecue. Here's Colonel Hierzberger to tell you more. All rise! Attention! Thank you! No report necessary. Sit down, gentlemen. Sergeant Major Eismayer sends his apologies. He has cancer. But he wrote this letter, which I will read to you now. "To conscription squad 12: Don't think you were the last squad to survive Eismayer. I'll be back. Furthermore, let it be known that all in all you were pretty decent. Some of you even have promising futures. Having said that, have a helluva party!" Gentlemen, gentlemen, I wish you all the best! Hello! Hello. Hi. Wow, you look horrible. What are you doing here? What does it look like? How are you? I feel like shit. I signed the enlistment documents. It's official, I'll be a career soldier. Sergeant Berger said, if a Yugo like me enlists, he wants to get discharged. Uh oh, you're puking again? I have all the documents for the entrance exam, too. But I'm totally clueless. You think you can help me? Yes. Get lost. I'll throw this out. Goodbye. Goodbye. You've got a handsome boy. What's important now is that you work out. The better your circulation, the tougher it is for the cancer cells. Follow me. You'll work out every day. For at least an hour. Record your reps here. And no nagging, or no shagging. Hey. No elevator. Take the stairs. Mario, please. Give me a break. Come on, Charles, let's go. Chop-chop. I hate you. I just got the delivery confirmation. The bed is coming tomorrow. You'll be home in the morning, right? You okay? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Are you giving up? Asshole. Charles. Quitting is for losers. Carry on! Yes, sir, keeping it up. 6 months later Honor Guard, forward - march! - Step two. Left step! Left! Left. Two. Listen to her purr! Flawless! Engine stop! Well, what do you say, Sergeant Major? They're being decommissioned, so I reserved five. It's amazing, you can take them apart with a single wrench. If necessary, of course. You're back already? Shouldn't you be in rehab? I got released early for good conduct. I see. I read your medical certificate. It says I am no longer allowed to employ you as an instructor. So here's the plan: Our current sarge is retiring. I think this position is right up your alley. And your physical impairment will not interfere. Captain, sir, that's not possible. It is possible. Believe it or not, the world keeps turning even without Eismayer. Dismissed. Mario? Hajde, hajde, Sergeant Major, sir. Do come in. Nutcase. What is it? I got in. I'm going to be an officer! I'm going to the military academy! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. The military academy! Congratulations. I got in. The military academy! Based on the applicant's achievement he is hereby accepted to the academy. Charles Eismayer and Falak. We rule the army. He passed the exam and is going to the military academy. Dude. Mario. Yes. What? Don't shit your pants. What, "Don't shit my pants"? I'm gonna be an officer. Eismayer and Falak. The two faggots in the army. - TODAY 8 PM FERRIS WHEEL! - WEAR SOMETHING NICE! Fuck... The Ferris Wheel? Seriously? Yes, seriously. You look good. Thanks. On the mark please. Come here. Smile. I'll send the photo via e-mail. Yes. If she puts that online, I kill her. Yes, relax. You know I don't drink sparkling wine. Grin and bear it. To us. No. To you! Again, congratulations! Remember when you came to our room that first night? I thought to myself: What a fucking dictator. You gonna push me out of the cable car now? They're cut from a 20 mm anti-aircraft cartridge. Try it on. Sometimes I really think you're retarded. How do you think this will play out? You become an officer, and we get married at the barracks? I apply for leave with Karnaval, and we spend our honeymoon in Dubai, stoning included? Mario. The world doesn't work the way your gay brain imagines it. I see. Do you refuse to understand or are you just too stupid? You know what I understand? That you're the chickenshit faggot, not me. Fourth Company, on my command. Attention! Right face! Double time to board, march! Presenting arms works mighty fine! It gives us drive and a heart. Which company? Fourth Company! Call the guard, don't let the convoy leave the barracks. Hey dipstick, are you sneaking off without saying goodbye? No, I didn't know... Just joking. Are they psyched? Totally. Raring to go. It's a great bunch. Great. Is Falak with them? Yes, second truck, why? Give me a minute. A minute. Corporal Falak. Here! Come here. Sergeant Major, sir, Corporal Falak reports as ordered. Good luck! Drive! Hello. Hello. Your son wants to see you. How's school? You like it? Yes. And the teacher, is she nice? Yes. Great. Why don't you like Mom anymore? What? Who said that? Of course I like Mom. Mom says, you like men more than women. She says, you probably already have a boyfriend. I like boys more than girls, too. The girls in my class are kind of stupid. My friends are Emir, Arthur, and Denial. But my very best friend is Louis, he's really cool. And what's your friend's name? Are the keys inside? Yes. And after some back and forth, everyone chipped in, and for 350 schillings she gave us all blow jobs at the same time. I hope your guys' dicks didn't touch, huh? If I were you, Falak, I'd shut the fuck up. First Platoon, Fourth Company... It's alright. Sit down. Sit down. Mario, it's just wonderful with you. And I'm not just talking about the sex. Everything. Mario, I want you. In my life. Everywhere. What's that supposed to mean? You wanna marry me? And we'll spend our honeymoon in Dubai? Stoning included. 20 mm anti-aircraft cartridge. Carry on. On January 31, 2014, Charles Eismayer and Mario Falak officially entered a civil union at the Maria Theresien Barracks. Both were still in active duty at the time of filming.
