(fire whooshing) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music continues) (soft intense music) (door unlocking) (door clicking) (door thudding) (door locking) (light switch clicking) (party poppers popping) - Happy birthday! (Lyra shrieking) - (laughing) Oh, my God, you arseholes. - Happy Birthday, Lyra. - [Lyra] Oh, thank you, I thought you'd forgotten. - We wouldn't forget you, our little Lyra. - Aw! - Drink? - Yeah, we wouldn't pass up an opportunity to have a party, would we, eh? - Hello, Ursa, I thought you were in Cumbria. - Yeah, we had to make it believable somehow and someone might have let something slip. - Sneaky. (laughing) I'm surprised you two kept it a secret. - Well, it doesn't say anywhere in the "Bible," that you can't surprise your friends. Plus it's omission and not lying, so. - [Lyra] Thank you, I was definitely surprised. - You're welcome. - Okay. - [Ursa] You had a hard day at work? - Yeah, every day's been bad at the moment. - I'm sorry that things have been bad at the moment. - How about you just forget about it for one night, yeah? - Yes, please. - Okay, we've got some booze. - Oh, that's good, 'cause I'm running low. - Nice place you've got here. - [Ursa] Yeah, you should see next door, they've got a pool. - Bloody hell, I could get used to living like this, beats my one-bedroom flat. (Ursa and Lyra laughing) - So what's on the agenda for tonight? - Party! - Whoo! (upbeat pop music) (group chattering) (upbeat pop music) (group chattering) - How did you see that? - There you go. Okay. - Whoo! - This is as exciting as you said it would be, it's actually boring. - I'm sorry, didn't know I was gonna have company. - Not you, let's do something more exciting. Let's play a drinking game. - Like what? - Ah, Truth or Dare. - And how's that a drinking game? - It's not a drinking game, I just wanna do something more interesting. - Okay, I'm up for it. - You're always up for it. (both laughing) - Well, I'm definitely in. - Ooh! - I'm out. - Come on, Leo, don't be a snowflake. - Does that mean you're tapping out too? - No, I'm in as long as we keep it tame, I'm not gonna break any commandments over a stupid game. - I'll be gentle, promise. - Fine, I'm in. - All right, all right! Leo, have you two... - I said tame. - Keep it PG or else I'm out. - All right, all right. Lyra, Truth or Dare? - Truth. - Okay, how come you live in this house on your own? - [Ursa] The truth, Lyra. - Can we start with someone else first? - Come on, just answer, then we'll move on. - It's my house, so I live here. - Yeah, but why don't you just sell it and move to the city? - I'm not selling it, it's my parents' place. - Yeah, but why- - That's enough. She answered. - Fine, your turn. - Okay, Phoenix, does asking intrusive questions make you feel like a big man? (all laughing) - It's Truth or Dare. - Okay, how come you're not in the military anymore? - Oh. - PTSD, you saw my record. You didn't ask Truth or Dare. - Oh, silly me. Maybe I forgot when you went for the jugular. - Hardly, it's a legitimate question. - Mate, you know her parents died. Why have you gotta be such a dick, huh? - All right, let's just calm down, okay. Look, it's Lyra's birthday, can we just stop with the name calling? - Okay, it's my turn. Ursa, Truth or Dare? - Dare. - I dare you to jump in the pool. - (laughing) This has got interesting. - That's breaking and entering. - Oh, but, but, but, but, this is Ursa's turn. - You know, I still need to live next to this guy. - A dare's a dare, if she forfeits, she'll have to live with the stigma of being a chicken. - Oh, good job that I'm not a chicken then. - Oh, shit, she's actually gonna do it. (Lyra laughing) (chair clattering) - I don't think this is a good idea, guys. - Oh, it's not such a bad idea. Carina knows that my neighbor's out for the weekend, so he's not back till tomorrow. - Not just a pretty face. - And I've got swimming costumes, shall we go? (soft tense music) - Wait for me. I don't wanna miss this. - Hurry up then. (laughs softly) Who's a chicken now? (Ursa laughing) - I know, isn't it? - Are you sure this is safe? - It's not smart, but it is safe. My neighbor works nights on weekends, so he won't be back till tomorrow. - Only if you're sure. - Mm-hm. - I don't wanna get you into trouble. - Once they've burned off that sexual tension, then it'll calm down. (Norma laughing) - If he is naked again, I am gonna puke. - Ew, I don't wanna. - I can't every single time. - That's so gross. - We go swimming, he's like everything- (water splashing) - Did she? (Lyra laughing) - Oh, she's done it. (all laughing) (water sloshing) - There you are. - You missed it, she jumped right in. - How is the water? - Yeah, it's lovely, it's actually salt, it's not chlorine. Get in. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Are you a bunch of chickens? - I'm no chicken. - I'm not missing out. (water splashing) (all laughing) - It's okay, we can go before her neighbor comes back. It'll be fun. - Birthday girl coming through! (water splashing) - Oh! (water sloshing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water sloshing) - [Phoenix] Welcome to the club, I didn't think you'd even dare. - Why does everyone have such low expectations of me? - Ah, 'cause your dad's a vicar. - [Norma] Ah, he actually prefers Pastor. - What, like Father Tagliatelle? - No, no, no, Pastor. - What's the difference? - Well, they're interchangeable, Pastor Joel, you know, he- - Oh, it was a rhetorical question. - Wow, you really are a dick. - Oh, nice one, Norma. (upbeat pop music) (water sloshing) (all laughing) (upbeat pop music) (water sloshing) (group chattering) (upbeat pop music) (water sloshing) (Lyra and Carina chattering quietly) (water sloshing) - Where are you going? - I need to pee. - Well, don't go too far. - I won't. (soft tense music) (soft orchestral music) These are some digs. (urine trickling) (soft tense music) (soft pulsing music) (group chattering) - Oh God, what's Phoenix doing? - Is he still not back yet? - I bet he's lost. - Yeah, lost on purpose more like. - He'd better not be up to something. - [Norma] Are you going to look for him? - Yeah, are you coming? - I'll come. - I just think I'll stay here. - I'm coming too, I wanna see how big the house is. - We're not going into the house. We're just gonna go find Phoenix and then go back to my place. (water sloshing) - Are we safe here? - I'll stay with you, keep you safe. - Oh, get a room. - [Norma] I really don't like this. - Lyra said it's fine, if the neighbor said we can use the pool, then it's no problem. - Yeah, but I still don't like it. You know, I don't really like Phoenix either. - Hm. - He's, he's a bit too brash. - And unpredictable. - Yeah. Hey, can we go when they come back? - Are you sure, I mean, Lyra's your friend, don't you wanna stay a little longer? - Yeah, I do, but I just don't know what we'll get into if we stay. - Okay, well, just wish her happy birthday and then we'll go, yeah. - Yeah, okay, fine. - Come on, let's just enjoy the pool for now, huh? We have it all to ourselves. - Leo, stop. (laughing) - Okay, okay, I know where to draw the limit. - They could be back any minute. - Oh, a minute is all I need. - That does not sound good for you. - (laughing) Time is relative. - Hm, I think we should just enjoy this. - Mm-hm. (water sloshing) - Wow! - Geez, this place is huge. (tense orchestral music) What does your neighbor do? - He's a doctor or something, I don't really know. He was friends with my parents, so I've never really met him. - You know, maybe I should be a doctor, if you can afford a place like that. - Can we just focus on finding Phoenix? I don't wanna be snooping around here, if my neighbor comes back early. - Is that likely? - Just in case. Oh, shit. - Maybe he's in there. - Why would he break in? - It's Phoenix, does there need to be a reason? - Yeah, open door's pretty much an invitation. - Who said the door was open? - Look at it, that's state of the art, I don't think anyone could break into that, least of all, an idiot like Phoenix. - If that's the case, then he's a bigger idiot than I thought, come on. - Yes, we get to see inside. - Mm-hm. (Ursa laughing) (door thudding) - Hitch. - Don't worry, there's no one here. - What if he comes home early and just walks in? It's not worth the risk. - Fine. Oh, he's gotta be here somewhere, like where can he be? Oh, maybe a side down there. - Oh, looks like a basement, who the hell has a basement? - People like this have basements to store wine and stuff. - Come on, let's just go in. (gentle orchestral music) Phoenix. - Check this out. - What are you doing, how did you even get down here? - Just punched a military sequence into the keypad and the door opened. - How? - It's a fail safe, like a kill code. Most military compounds have the same system. Have you ever seen anything like this before? - You shouldn't be down here. - Oh, don't be a pansy, there's no one down here. (gentle orchestral music) - What is it? - It's an egg, duh! - An egg? Like a pretty big dinosaur laid that. - [Carina] What kind of doctor did you say he is? - I don't know. (gentle orchestral music) But don't touch it. - Relax, I'm not gonna break it. (gentle orchestral music) - What did you do? - I didn't do anything. (eggshell cracking) (soft tense music) - What was that? - I don't know. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Lyra, what's going on? - What? - [Norma] What's going on, did you find Phoenix? - Yeah, we found him, but something really strange is happening. - What's happening? What is that? - [Norma] I-I'm coming to get you. - No, Norma, Norma, stay where you are. Stay there, we'll be right out. - This is crazy. - Yeah, I don't like this at all. - I think we need to get out of here. No, don't get too close. - It's okay. - Phoenix. - Ssh! - Don't, don't. - It's just an egg. (soft tense music) - Hello. - [Norma] Get out now. - What? (Norma speaking indistinctly) - I can't hear you. - The owner, he's coming back. - Shit! - Right, we need to go and hide, we need to go and hide now. - Get the hell out of here. - Lyra! - Okay. Phoenix. (soft tense music) Phoenix, we need to go. (door clicking) (soft tense music) (Carina gasping) (door thudding) - Shit, someone's coming. - Hide! - Let's go, Phoenix, we need to go. (soft tense music) (door thudding) (door locking) (keys jangling) (footsteps tapping) (door clicking) (soft tense music) (phone thudding quietly) (keyboard tapping) (soft tense music) - What? (gasping) (Micha laughing) (object clattering) (soft tense music) (door handle rattling) - It's locked. - There must be another way out. (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) - You're cold, Lacerta. That's your name, Lacerta. If you can hear me, that's where you come from. We found you on an asteroid that we thought originated in the Lacerta constellation. You traveled 102 light years to reach our solar system. We sent out an unmanned probe to intercept the asteroid and we discovered it was debris from a planet, that disappeared hundreds of years ago. We found remnants of an advanced species on what remained of that planet (soft tense music) and we searched for months and months. Finally, we found an egg. We found you. (laughing) But I couldn't watch what they had planned for you. You are something very special, very special and I was afraid they were, they were gonna use you, gonna use you and I couldn't have that, I couldn't have that. So I brought you here with me, where you'll be safe. (gentle orchestral music) (phone beeping) There you are. (object thudding quietly) (lights buzzing) It's okay, you're safe here with me. This is for your own good. I've got something that'll help. (soft tense music) It's okay. Come closer. (object thudding quietly) It's all right, you-you can trust me. I won't hurt you. (Lacerta growling softly) (soft tense music) (eerie orchestral music) (intense orchestral music) Stop. (heart beating) (intense orchestral music) S-stop! Lacerta! Stop! (Lacerta clicking) - It's locked, we need to get the hell out of here. - Calm down, look at me, okay, we can't just leave them both down there, so we need to go and get them. - I know. - Okay. - I know. - Okay, come on. - Uh! (Micha thudding to floor) Lacerta, stop! (Lacerta clicking) Lacerta, stop! Please, stop! (intense orchestral music) Uh! (Lacerta clicking) Uh! (breathing fearfully) (electronic locks banging) (door creaking) (blow thudding) You can't leave. (Lacerta clicking) (flesh ripping) (Micha screaming) (Micha groaning) (Lacerta growling) (tense orchestral music) (Micha choking) (Lacerta clicking) (solemn orchestral music) (solemn orchestral music continues) - Is he gone? What was that thing? (Micha groaning) - We need something to stop the bleeding. - Like what? - I don't know, a towel or something. It's okay, it's okay, I'm a nurse. - M-mustn't let him leave. - What? - Promise me, I don't want them to get their hands on him. - Who? - Them. - I don't know what you're talking about. Phoenix, hurry up. (solemn orchestral music) - Come on, we've got to do something. - Micha, Micha, Micha, stay with me. Stay with me, yeah. Stay with me. Yeah. Micha. (solemn orchestral music) (Lyra sobbing) This is your fault. - Me, what did I do? - You came down here nosing around and look what you've done, now he's dead. You killed him! - I didn't kill anyone. - He would still be alive, if it wasn't for you! (Lyra sobbing) - Lyra. Hey, hey, hey. (phone ringing) - [Norma] Lyra, what's going on? The whole place is locked down. - He's dead. - Wait, what do you mean? - [Lyra] He's dead. - What happened? - [Lyra] That thing got him. - What thing? What thing? Shit, there's no signal. - What's, what's wrong? - I don't know, she just said, that someone called Micha's dead. - The neighbor, dead, h-how? - I don't know, but something is seriously wrong here. - Okay, okay, well, um, what do, what do we do? - I think we need to get the doors open and just, just get them out. - That place is like Fort Knox, we'll never get in there. - We need to try, my friends are in there. - Okay, okay, let's go. - Okay. (intense music) (leaves rustling) - What was that? - What? - Get back in the pool. - Why? - Just do it! (water splashing) (Lacerta clicking) (soft tense music) - What did you see? - I-I don't know. (Lacerta clicking) Keep your head down. - I'm scared. - Ssh! Just take a deep breath, okay. (both inhaling deeply) (water sloshing) (owl hooting) (tense orchestral music) - Where is it? - It's over that way. - [Phoenix] How do you know how to work that thing? - [Lyra] I don't, I just figure that Micha wants to know where the alien is if it gets captured. - Who is this guy? - I don't know, I-I'm starting to rethink everything my parents ever told me, like maybe they knew something about this. - No, I doubt it, it's just a neighbor. - Well, I hope it's that innocent. (water sloshing) (Leo gasping) (soft tense music) (Lacerta clicking) (soft intense music) - Ah! (water sloshing) - (gasping) What the hell is that thing? - I don't know, but it-it seems to be afraid of the water. - I think you're right. Maybe it's like a self-preservation thing that animals do? - Yeah, but what is it? What you want? - I don't think it can understand you. - Is-is it an animal? - [Norma] That's not like any type of animal I've ever seen. - What's it doing? (Lacerta growling) - I think it's looking for something. - We need to get out of here though and that door's locked, so what do you suggest? - Um, I-I think that we need a code to deactivate the lockdown. - Give it here. (phone buzzing) (Phoenix sighing) - What happens if there's no more attempt after that? - I know, but it could be worse than this. - Worse than this, what could be worse than this? - That there has to be another way out of here, we can't be locked in here. (phone ringing) - Don't, wait here. - Ssh, just keep a lookout, okay? (phone ringing) (intense music) Oh! (Norma gasping) (water sloshing) (Lacerta growling) - Leo! (intense orchestral music) (water splashing) (Lacerta shrieking) (water splashing) (skin sizzling) (Lacerta groaning) (phone beeping) - Voicemail. - Oh, call the police, just call the police. - No, no, we can't call the police. We broke into my neighbor's house. There is a dead body downstairs and there's an alien running around. - Police, we can't call the police, I'm not going back, I'm not supposed to be here. - Calm down. - Oh, I need to get out of here. Oh, I forgot the water. - No, Phoenix, wait. - Wait. - Where does he think he's going? - Oh, he's AWOL, isn't he? So if the police catch him, he'll get in trouble. - Could this day get any worse? - We need to stick together, girls, come on. - Leo. (sobbing) (water sloshing) (solemn orchestral music) Eternal rest, grant unto him. O Lord, and let Your perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. (solemn orchestral music) Love always in the name of Jesus. (sobbing) (tense pulsing music) - Guys. Guys? Phoenix? Phoenix. (tense pulsing music) (Lacerta clicking softly) (tense pulsing music) (door clicking) (door thudding) (tense pulsing music) (Carina breathing fearfully) (handle rattling) - Oh, come on, come on. (hand thudding) Oh, God. (door handle rattling) (door handle rattling) - [Carina] Lyra, is that you? (door creaking) (soft tense music) (Lacerta clicking) (intense music) (soft tense music) (Lacerta clicking) (Carina screaming) (owl hooting) - Phoenix. It's moving. - Where is it? - It's on the other side of the house back where we were. but it's moving and moving fast. - And where's Phoenix? - Well, if he's smart, he's gonna be hiding somewhere, but if he's out in the open, then he's screwed. - Wait, where's Carina? - Oh, crap. - Should we go back? - We're gonna have to. - What if the alien is out there? - It's gonna be okay. - I don't think I just- - We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll just find Phoenix, find Carina and find a way out of here. - Okay, yeah. (Lacerta clicking) - Did you hear that? Let's just find them and get out of here. (tense humming music) (Phoenix breathing heavily) - Come on, come on. (Lacerta clicking) (footsteps tapping) (soft tense music) (Lacerta roaring) (door clicking) - Phoenix, Phoenix. (footsteps thudding) - Okay, this way. (door creaking) (soft tense music) (Lacerta growling) (door handle rattling) - Come on. (Phoenix gasping) (Lacerta growling) (soft intense music) (door clicking) (soft tense music) Good puppy. (Lacerta growling) Good puppy, Lacerta. (Lacerta clicking) That's it. I mean you no harm. (soft tense music) (Lacerta clicking) We had a moment back there, remember? I'm your friend. (Lacerta growling softly) Good doggie. (soft tense music) - It's moving. - Yeah. - It's moving. (Lacerta growling) (Phoenix screaming) - He got, he got him, he got. - It works every time. (Lacerta growling) (Phoenix screaming) (blows thudding) (Phoenix groaning) (Lyra gasping) - Ssh! (blows thudding) (Lacerta growling) We need to go back this way. We'll go together. (Lacerta growling softly) (soft tense music) - We need to find Carina. (soft tense music) - She's gone. - How do you know? - It got her, I saw her body in one of the rooms. - Carina. - Look, we need to go, okay, find a way out. (soft tense music) (door creaking) Ssh! (vase shattering) (all gasping softly) (Lacerta growling) Hide! (soft tense music) (door creaking) (intense music) (Lacerta thudding) (Lacerta growling) (Lacerta clicking) (Ursa gasping fearfully) (soft tense music) (object clattering) (Lacerta growling softly) (Lacerta roaring) (eerie discordant music) (Lacerta thudding) (Lacerta growling) - It sounded like it was communicating, calling out to something. - What like others? He was speaking to his friend? (object thudding quietly) (Ursa gasping fearfully) - Guys, we're just like sitting ducks. We've got to get the fuck out of here, come on. (door clicking) (door thudding) - [Norma] This is how I got in. - Thank God you called out when you did. - Thank you, you saved us. - Yeah, well, I couldn't exactly leave you in there, could I? - What happened to Leo, where's Leo? - It-it got him. - When? - When we were in the pool. The house had just been locked down and we were about to come and get you out. It-it got him. - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - How did you get away? - I don't know, it just- - [Lyra] Lacerta. - What? - His name's Lacerta. - The alien, they found it in the Lacerta constellation. - It's an alien? - Yeah. - Well, I-I thought aliens didn't exist. - Believe it. - When, when we were in the pool, I, I splashed it and it really didn't like it. (skin sizzling) (Lacerta groaning) I think maybe there's something in the water, that might harm it, it didn't wanna come anywhere near us, when we were in the pool. - It's something in the water? - [Norma] Yeah. - Salt. - It-it must react to its skin or the wet stuff on its skin. - So what are we gonna do, just like throw it in the ocean? - No, the nearest ocean's two hours away and I don't want that thing in my boot. - Well, what are we gonna do, what are we gonna do? - Look, I've got a plan, follow me. I think the window malfunctioned or something. (feet thudding) (feet thudding) (feet thudding) Look, my dad's church is near here, okay, he'll know what to do. - What's your dad gonna do? He's just a priest. - Well, he wasn't always a priest, you know. - Come on, it's as good a plan as any and we've got to get as far away from here as possible. - Okay. - Let's go, it's this way. (classical organ music) (classical organ music continues) (classical organ music continues) (crow cawing) Hopefully there's no one in confession. - [Ursa] I don't think your dad would have time in his schedule to hear all my confessions. (all laughing) - Let's go. (door clicking) (door thudding) - Dad. Dad. - Oh, he can't have followed us here, can he? - Check. - No, that's okay, it's still at the house. - Dad. - Norma? What, what? (laughing) What happened? - We were celebrating a birthday party. - It-it was a monster. - A monster, what are you talking about? - Brace yourself, Father, this isn't gonna be easy to wrap your head around. - Look, if something has hurt my little girl, I want to know. - Um... My neighbor was growing an animal in his basement and it has got free and killed my neighbor and three of our friends and it almost killed us, but we managed to escape. - Norma, I need to know, are you girls doing the drugs? - Dad, you need to listen to me. Okay, that-that thing, it's coming for us. It killed Carina. It killed Leo. - [Joel] Leo's dead? - Yeah. - Oh, honey. So this thing is killing people? Right, well, where is it now? - It's still in my neighbor's house. - What we're gonna do is we're gonna go into the back, I'm gonna make some tea and we're going to ring the police. - No, we can't do that. - Why not, why not? - H-how are we gonna explain to the police, that we broke into my neighbor's house, set an animal free and watched our friends get killed and now we're just hiding in a church drinking tea? You heard what Micha said, he said, "Don't let them get it." I-I don't know who he's working for, but he was so scared. It could be the government or a secret organization or worse. - So what are we supposed to do now then? - I don't know yet, but we're gonna ask God for guidance. Follow me. - Oh, my God. - [Micha] The readings appear to be promising, but there are so many differences to what we're expecting, it's just difficult to be certain. - Guys, there's diary entries on here. - Is there a USB? We can plug it into the laptop. (crockery clattering) - Yeah. - It's been 14 days and I can already tell there are signs of life. The egg has nearly doubled in weight and there's been a steady increase in temperature over the last week. The readings appear to be promising, but there are so many differences to what we're expecting, it's just difficult to be certain. The temperature reading's 23.5, which is five to seven degrees warmer than the probe recorded on the, on the surface. In the Lacerta constellation, the light comes from a weak, blue sun and hence why in the lab, I fitted this blue light with a dimmer to mimic the same conditions, that he would've been exposed to, had he have been hatched on his home planet. - I'm sorry, what? - Ssh! - There's no telling what his temperament might be, so I have taken the same precautions that we did at the lab, back at the compound. I guess this will be a record of the events surrounding the birth of Lacerta. I named him Lacerta after his home, I think it's a fitting name, like a warrior's name and I hope he learns to love it as much as I do. From what we know, based on evidence we found on the Canus Asteroid, the civilization was highly advanced. We can only assume that this creature was at the top of the food chain, so similar to homo sapiens here on Earth. But something must have happened, some cataclysmic event that destroyed their planet and eradicated the entire species. (gentle orchestral music) We can only hypothesize as to what that might have been, but maybe if we knew what that was, it it could help us to prevent the same thing from happening here. If what we found is true, (phone beeping) the species was highly intelligent and able to build constructs we have yet to develop here on Earth. (Lacerta breathing heavily) (leaves rustling) (soft intense music) And that's why I brought you here. I don't want them using you to make more weapons. "Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved through understanding." Einstein said that. I-I don't know if anyone will see these videos, but I hope they're found by someone in authority, who can look after him in the event that anything happens to me. The one thing that we know for certain, unanimous agreement among my colleagues and I is that we- (soft tense music) - What happened? - I don't know. (keyboard tapping) He's here. - What, he figured out how to cut the power? - M-Micha said he's really intelligent and he, um, he was learning fast, so he must have figured out a way to escape. (Lacerta growling) (soft tense music) - All right, I want you girls to go and hide in the sacristy. - What, Dad, no, what are you gonna do? (tense pulsing music) - I will not allow this thing into my church, the house of the One Almighty God. I don't care if it is an alien or a demon, it is not one of God's creations, it is an abomination. Go now, I will deal with this thing. - You can't go, Dad, you don't know what it can do. - I have God on my side and he will show me the light. Go. (tense pulsing music) (tense pulsing music continues) (phone beeping) - What happens if he can find a way in? - My dad will know what to do. - I don't think confidence is gonna get him very far. - I think it'll be fine. (soft tense music) (Lacerta growling softly) (Lacerta clicking) (door clicking) (soft tense music) (Lacerta growling softly) - You're not welcome here. This is the house of the Lord. There's no place for your kind. Begone from here, demon, lest thee be subjected to the power of Christ. (soft tense music) Father, give me the strength to ward off this abomination. (melodic organ music) In the name of the Father and of the son and of the Holy, (blow thudding) spirit! (Lacerta roaring) (melodic organ music) - How did your dad learn how to do that? - He used to be a boxer before he found God. (melodic organ music) (blows thudding) (Lacerta groaning) (melodic organ music) (Lacerta growling) (melodic organ music) (object clattering) (Lacerta clicking) (blow thudding) (Joel thudding to floor) (Lacerta growling) (blows thudding) (melodic organ music) - (sobbing) I have to go and help him. - You will not defeat me, beast! - (speaking Latin) Depart this house of God! (Lacerta growling) Yield! Yield! (Holy water sloshing) (Lacerta growling) (soft orchestral music) (Norma gasping) Dad. (Joel groaning) Dad. - How did you do that? You said it was an alien, not a demon. - Salt hurts it. - And you know I oversalt my Holy water. (Norma laughing) I love you. You have become everything that I wished I could be. Today... Today, you were more than just my flock, you were my trusted sheepdog, always vigilant and now you must become the shepherd. - No, no, I'm not ready to lose you, I still need you. - No, no, I needed you. You taught me more with your existence than the "Bible" ever did through scripture. I'm proud to call you daughter. Blood of my blood. Your beating heart goes on, while mine no longer beats. I love you. I love you. - No, no, no, no, Dad. (sobbing) No, no, Dad. (solemn orchestral music) (Norma gasping) - It's just us. (Norma sobbing) - I'm sorry for everything I ever said, he was amazing. - He gave his life for us. (Lacerta growling) - We have to go. - No, no. - We have to go. - I can't leave him. - We have to go. - [Lyra] We cannot stay here. - We have to. - Come on, we need to go. Come on. (footsteps thudding) - Hey, did you just see it? - [Lyra] No. - I love you guys. - We love you too. - Sorry I'm such a dick sometimes. (all laughing) - We forgive you. (Lacerta growling) (Ursa gasping fearfully) (intense music) (Ursa screaming) (Lacerta clicking) (Lacerta roaring) (blows thudding) (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) (Lyra sobbing) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - It got Ursa. - I know. - There's none of us left. - Look, if we don't get out of here, we're gonna be next, okay, we-we need to leave. - What are we gonna tell their families? - I don't know, we couldn't have saved them, there's literally nothing that we could have done. - The only reason they were even here was 'cause of me, they wouldn't, they wouldn't have died, if I hadn't been here. - No, no. - [Lyra] If we weren't celebrating my birthday. - Don't say that, this is not your fault. - I think it kind of is though. - Don't think like that, okay, what's done is done. We just, we need to leave now, okay, okay? - I don't think I can, I don't, I don't know what to do, we don't know where it is, we don't know. - It's okay, look, we've got this far. We can do this, we just need to get out of here now. My dad's car is around the corner, okay, he-he always leave the keys in there. Let's just make a run for it, just get out of here, okay? (Lacerta growling) (soft tense music) Shit, come on, come on, come on. (tense orchestral music) I think we're almost there. (Lacerta growling) Come on, come on, come on, let's go! (tense orchestral music) There it is. (car doors clicking) (car doors thudding) (both breathing heavily) (soft tense music) (car ignition stuttering) (soft pulsing music) No, no, no, no, no. (sobbing) Why'd you have to buy a second-hand car? (phone beeping) (soft tense music) - He's coming, lock the doors. (blow thudding) Oh! (blow thudding) (intense music) (both screaming) (Lacerta roaring) (intense music) - You killed my father. You killed my father. (sobbing) (soft tense music) - Where did he go? - I don't know. Oh, shit. - How does he keep finding us? - I don't know. No, I've had enough of this. He can't just go around killing everyone. (soft tense music) - What are you doing? (Norma grunting) Where are you going? - I'm going to end this. (car door clicking) - Wait. (car door thudding) Wait. (soft orchestral music) - Where are you? (soft orchestral music) Where are you? (soft orchestral music) (eerie tense music) (blow thudding) - [Lyra] Norma! (blows thudding) (intense music) - Get away from her, you bitch! Come and get me! (blows thudding) (intense music) Lyra, I'm coming to save you! (eerie intense music) - What's going on? - I don't know! (eerie intense music) (spaceship rumbling loudly) What on Earth is that? (eerie intense music) (spaceship rumbling loudly) (Lacerta growling) (eerie intense music) (spaceship rumbling loudly) (blow thudding) (Lyra screaming) (eerie intense music) (static hissing) - The one thing that we know for certain, unanimous agreement among my colleagues and I, is that we are not alone in this universe and there are probably more of them out there.
