Police say the man was a Good Samaritan stabbed while trying to stop a mugging. Surveillance video shows the man bleeding to death on the sidewalk for over an hour as 25 people passed him by. The man continues to attack the women, knocking them both to the ground for a second time while people stand by and film the assault. In a video that has gone viral, a young girl is brutally attacked, and instead of helping her, people pull out their cellphones and record the incident. In what has become an all too familiar occurrence, the victim was attacked while bystanders, including security guards, stood by and watched. The victim is still in critical condition. Her family is demanding that the witnesses be held accountable, but there are no laws compelling people to help others in distress or danger. A drunk driver slams into the man. As he lies crumpled on the street for almost two minutes, a total of 15 cars drive by him. No one stops to help. As the beating continued, several people filmed the assault. The victim later died from his injuries. But the story doesn't end there. In an eerie coincidence, after posting the shocking video online, two witnesses were later found dead. Dad? What are you doing? Happy Birthday? I'm making pancakes. - Was trying to make pancakes. - I love you. And I love the effort, but, you know, maybe you should stop. Your mom always had birthday pancakes ready for you when you woke up. That is right, Mickey Mouse face and sprinkles. It's been years. Well, I still want my key back. That was for emergencies only. This was an emergency. I thought I'd start your day with a smile. Okay, fine, you can keep the key if it makes you feel better. - Who is that? - Mm? Probably Josh. Birthday surprise. Ha! He's bringing you the birthday sex. Ew. Dad, no. Oh, my God. And who says "the sex?" Ugh. Okay. - Okay. - Dad... Daddy! Dad! Where is the money? - Where is the money? - Leave him alone! Caitlin! Why! Come on. We've got a pulse. She's coming back. I was going through my dad's old Bible. - Mm-hmm. - And inside there is this note that he had written. He loved his mottos. And it said... "Sometimes you have to choose to be happy." That is great. But I am worried... I'm still having hallucinations. That is normal as you heal. Honestly, your recovery is miraculous. Did Zach check the server? I knew it. Jesus, just forget it. I'll come in. I got to head back in the office, I leave for a few hours, the whole place falls apart. Oh, no worries, I'm good. Uh... I actually just called the school about getting my old job back. - Really? Okay. - Mm-hmm. You around a bunch of little rug rats? Careful, you might catch a baby fever. You never know. Looking for your stash? Jerk, I told you I will quit next month. I know, it's always next month. Don't worry, you can still get all your nicotine fix, just without all the tar, and cancer, and... Fine, fine, no more procrastinating. Heard that before. Maybe you should think about getting out. I am. I think I'm going to go for a run. I was thinking... something a little bit more permanent. They caught the guys, I'm safe. I know, I just thought maybe it'd be good for your recovery. This is my house. I'm not going to let them take that from me, too. You're right. Enjoy the run. I'd come with you, but... They need your big brain at the office. Have I ever told you I think nerds are incredibly sexy? Um. It's geeks, babe, the term is geeks. - Bye. - Bye, I love you. ...I'm so lost. No, no, no, no, you said that she was moving out, - you promised me. - Stop being hysterical. It's just taking... Just chill. - Are you all right? - Yes. - Just embarrassed. - No, don't be. - Douglas. - Caitlin. Well, have a good run, Caitlin. Help me. Give me your phone, give me your phone! What are you doing? Does this look like the guy? - Ms. Kramer? - Um? Um. Does this look like the guy? Yeah. Good. We'll put out an APB. I'll call you if I have any more questions. Has your number changed since your father's case? Mm-mm. Do you think he's going to be all right? It's hard to say right now. Okay. - Can I go get some air? - Yeah, let's go. There is nothing I could've done. He could've had a gun. - You can't expect me to risk... - ...I probably could've taken him, but she grabbed my arm, scared he might have a gun. She asked me not to leave her, so... ...I recorded it for you guys, you know? In case he got away. You sure you don't want to talk about it? I should warn you, the video footage you're about to see is disturbing. Video of the assault in Bristol Park and the fact that several bystanders stood by and just watched it happened has sent shockwaves through the city. Douglas Helton was a good man involved in a lot of charitable works around the city and his death... Well, it tears me up. And judging from the public outcry, I'm not alone. Now, joining us on today's show is the man who filmed the attack, computer programmer, Nathan Rome. Nathan, welcome, thanks for speaking with us today. Thank you for having me, I feel horrible about what happened, and I just wanted an opportunity to explain myself. Yes, go ahead. Please, explain away. Tell us how you could just stand there and watch a man get beaten to death. Basically, if you, if anyone had done anything at all, he would still be alive. Help me. Hey, you. Hungry? I couldn't sleep last night. I can't stop thinking about Douglas. I feel awful. What happened to him, it... It's horrible. But, babe, that is not on you. I read online that there is a vigil in the park tonight. - I think I can go after church. - Want me to meet you there? You don't want to come to church? I'll go for you. You know, church isn't really my thing. I mean, you don't want I start going all Damien with the thrashing - and the screaming. - It's okay. - Yeah. - I... I can just meet you after. Okay. I should probably do this on my own. Hey. We didn't get a chance to, uh, talk earlier. Althea. Caitlin. I don't see any of the others here. I almost didn't come. I thought coming here might give me a sense of closure. I have a son... Jesse. His father died years ago and, uh... I lost my job and our house. He's my world. I got no regrets about what I did. Excuse me. Did you all know Doug? Uh, yeah. Through work. I'm Lucas, his brother. If you two are free this weekend, we're doing a tribute video. I'd love to have you all come share some memories of him. I'll try. I'm sorry about your brother. I lost my dad recently. I know how hard it is. Well, the police said a witness came forward, so I hope they'll catch the guy soon. And those people who watched. I'm glad you came. I know Doug would've appreciated it. Thank you. I got to get home to my boy. I made my peace. - You take care. - Thanks, you too. Christ, forgive me. At the end, all of the candles just blew out. Felt like somebody walked over my grave. I still feel that chill. I guess I'll warm you up. Hot chocolate. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. You've seriously never seen this? Where have you been, on Mars? Check it. He totally wails on the dude. And the dude tried to crawl away. And, bam! Kidney punch. Hey, that is messed up. And you're messed up for watching it. Want to know something really messed up? Nathan Rome, the guy who took this, he lives right upstairs. No way. - Oh, God. - Caitlin, it's just a coincidence. I'll be right back. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. So, basically, if you, if anyone had done anything at all, he would still be alive. - Honey, are you all right? - Something is wrong. Something is wrong. I... Um... Caitlin. Caitlin. Hey, hey, wow, easy, easy. - How is your head feeling? - Uh, it's throbbing. Yeah, I bet, that was a nasty fall. Luckily, though, no concussion. So... You said you saw someone. In the window, I... I didn't get a good look at him. They said they found a note in his place saying he was sorry. They think that because of his issues - and being outed like that, but... - No. No, I'm sure I saw someone. The coroner's report says that Nathan Rome died at 9:12, the same time as Douglas Helton. This eerie coincidence has not gone unnoticed by local residents. It's not a coincidence. It's karma. When you do evil, evil comes back to you. Okay, sensationalized bullshit. - What if she's right? - Caitlin. I felt something when Nathan fell. Come on, let's get some sleep. Detective Boyd wants to get your statement in the morning. Hi. I am here to see detective Boyd, I'm Caitlin Kramer. I'll let him know. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Hey, Shaina. Is Boyd in? - Yeah, let me get him for you. - Thank you. Hi. - Hi. - Uh. Sorry, I forgot your name. Uh, Caitlin. Oh, right. Lucas. It's nice to see you again. Is everything okay? Yeah. Why? Well, you're here. I'm sorry. - I... - Sorry for what? - Uh... - Hey, it's nice to meet you. Josh. I'm sorry about your brother, man. Thank you. Ms. Kramer. You can come on back. Come on in. Thanks for coming down. - Thank you for letting me in. - You're welcome. Sergeant Boyd, can I speak with you? I'll be right in. Hey. Hi, Tony Cusumano. - Caitlin. - You two know each other? We met at the vigil. I was going to go, but my wife... I haven't told her. Join the club, man. I'm Curt. And this is Maria. - I can speak for myself. - Oh, I know that. - You never stop talking. - God! You know what? Let's just have a little bit of sympathy for the guy who died and the one who killed himself. I don't think he killed himself. I was at his building. When he fell. I saw somebody in his window. What are you talking about? Sir, wait. You can't go in there. You were there. You all were. And you. You looked me in the eyes and said that you knew what I was going through. - Are you arresting them? - They didn't break any laws. - They let my brother die! - We'll catch the guy who did this. Come on. I promise, come on. Let's go, let's go to my office. How can you live with yourselves? Great, more grief, just what I need. All you need? You didn't just lose a brother. - Neither did you. - Hey, you are cold, man. - We all own a part of this. - The guilt was killing me, okay, I saw it, I had to do something! - Yeah, we all saw something. - Okay. Did you ever think to call the cops, you know, anonymously? They came to my house. Had a hell of a time explaining that to my wife. Now you're scared to lie to her? Wha... what happened to Nathan? She said there was someone at the window. She made a mistake. - But I saw somebody... - We'll talk privately. I brought you all here because media is painting you as villains. Reporters are trying to find out who you are. So be vigilant, but this is all going to blow over. There will be another tragedy or scandal, and you'll be old news. We need to talk. Straight that way. Everyone here seems to know them pretty well. We work with the family's charity. But I didn't bring you down here to talk about that. I know you think you saw someone in Nathan's apartment. I did. Look. I didn't wanted to bring this up in front of the others, but... Josh told me about your hallucinations. I know when I'm hallucinating and I know when I'm not, I promise. It's different. There's no evidence anyone else was inside Nathan's apartment. So while I finish this investigation, I need to be sure no one else starts any unnecessary panic. - Understood? - Yes! Okay. - I can't believe you told him. - Just about the hallucinations, I didn't tell him about everything. Oh, oh, okay, well, thank you for that. I thought you had my back, Josh. - I'm just looking out for you. - Um. Come on, you have to know that. I'm going to go for a walk. To clear my head. You and I can talk later. "I will bring trouble upon them, all the things they fear. For when I called out to them, they refused to answer. And when I spoke, they would not hear." You look lost, child. What did you say about not hearing? God says, "Do not fear, I will help you." He has a plan for us, you just have to listen to the signs. Love thy Lord, thy God with all thy heart and thy soul. And love thy neighbor as thyself. All the answers are there. Luke 10:27. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Pretty amazing, huh? And this is just the beginning. Thanks to the public, we are building three new homeless shelters for battered women. And you let me die, Caitlin. You... let... me... die! Die! Look, I know I can be a little loose with the lips... but you know I got your back. Basically all of you. It's okay, we're good. You sure? Your face isn't saying we're fine. I'm just a little bit creeped out right now. So. Douglas Helton's birthday is the same day as mine. August 27th. And I don't know why, I just feel like it's a weird coincidence. "In the magical universe, there are no coincidences." William S. Burroughs. Brilliant dude. And a drug addict. And today, I ran into a street preacher, and he quoted Luke 27. - Um, it's a lot of 27s. Could be a sign. - Yeah. - That's what I was thinking... - Honey, I'm just kidding. If you look hard enough, you can find signs anywhere. After all that I've been through, can you really blame me for having faith? Of course not, I love you for it. Just don't want you torturing yourself over all of this. Happy Birthday? I thought I'd start your day off with a smile. Why? Hello? Help! Hello? Help me. Help me. Hello? Help me! - Hey. - No, help! What the hell is going on? Someone grabbed me. I don't see anyone. - Stop! - Are you okay? - I heard you screaming. - Where did you come from? And I've got a bruise from where he grabbed me. He? So a man attacked you? The neighbor said he didn't see anyone. Josh didn't see anyone either. What if it wasn't a person? I was dead for almost three minutes. They say those who die and come back are more sensitive or more connected to the spiritual world. Some people believe that. But it's the medical field's position that paranormal experience is a symptom of psychosis. Do you think I'm psychotic? This isn't about me, this is about you and what you believe. I believe that my actions... and my choices are coming back to haunt me. My brother was a forgiving man. But he also believed in accountability. These cowards think that they can hide in the shadows. But the light of truth is about to shine on them. The bad Samaritans are... Althea Noble... Maria Sanchez, Tony Cusumano... Curt Miley... What the hell? ...Caitlin Kramer. Thank you. Who does that? How could that happen? What was he thinking about? Caitlin. You need to be focusing on your recovery, not going down some rabbit hole. I know you're going through a lot. But your name is out there now, you're not safe. Josh, I will not run. And I think I remember something. Red, triangle. Interesting. Yeah, I think it could be a, um, a necklace, or a keychain, or something. Okay. Thank you. That guy, I think I saw... Saw what? Nothing. I'm just a little worried h... he's out there and now he knows who we are. We've got everyone working this case, we haven't caught the guy, but we found a pair of black gloves in the garbage can by the park. Forensics is running the DNA. I'll keep you updated. Call me if you think of anything else. Yeah, I will. Have a good night. What are you doing? At the station, Curt said, "We all saw something." What if we saw something that separately doesn't mean anything, but together can help us find the man who killed Douglas. Well, if you have a theory, tell the police. But they're not going to believe me, not without proof. I have to talk to the others. No, you need to stay here and calm down. Calm down? I have an opportunity to make this right. If you don't want to help me, fine, but stay out of my way. - Hey. - Hey. At least you're not another one of those reporters. Come on in. - Want a drink? - No, no, I'm good. I hate drinking alone. My wife left me. See how long that lasts. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you about the park. Jesus, I'm tired of talking about it, - tired of thinking about it. - Okay, okay, I understand. But I have to ask you. Have you... ...experienced anything strange lately? - Strange like? - Like, have you seen anything weird? Or felt like you're being attacked? Hey, you want to know how I feel? When I think about what I did to my family... to Maria... what happened to that guy at the park... I feel like shit, okay? And I want to stop feeling anything. Anything at all. What the hell? Has that happened before? No. Birds usually don't crash into my window. Why the hell are you here? At the station, you said, we all saw something. Yeah, we saw a guy getting the crap beat out of him. How about since then? - Like what? - Like... Douglas. - Get out. - I promise, - you can tell me if you've see... - Get out! - Hello? - Hey, Curt? It's Caitlin. I ca... I can't hear you, I'm, I'm in the basement. I'm sorry, I'm just calling to make sure everything is okay. Ho... Hold on. Curt? Curt? Hey, Curt? Help me. Curt. I called the police. They'll be here in any minute. Curt. Curt! Curt? Oh, my God. Hey, hey! It's okay. The story about the attack in Bristol Park has taken another twist. Curt Miley was found dead last night. He's the second witness to the brutal assault to die mysteriously and everyone is asking: Is this just a coincidence or something more? Our phone lines have been burning up. I saw the video. It's disgusting. If you ask me, they're getting what's coming to them. If I saw one of them in trouble, I would do exactly what they did. Absolutely nothing. They're just a bunch of cowards and they get to go on with their lives while that poor guy is dead. It's not fair. And if law don't do something to these people, can you really be surprised if someone decides to take justice into their own hands? If I were them, I'd be scared. This isn't a coincidence. People get what is coming to them. One way or the other, you can't escape karma. A crow flew into his window, you know a crow is a sign of death, right? All right, listen, after last night, I can't deny something weird is definitely going on... but I don't know what you want to find here. Answers. The death of this righteous man, is on every tongue. But this story isn't new. It goes back, back to the tale of the Good Samaritan. Now, Jesus never said that this was a parable. So... it is possible that he was describing an actual event. The story teaches us lessons of compassion. It's right in front of you. Right in front of you if you choose to see it. Luke, chapter ten. It is a story about a treacherous road that leads from Jericho to Jerusalem that is known as "The Way of Blood." Caitlin. What are you doing here? - Josh! Josh. - You put her name out there, man? - You put her life in danger. - That's enough. - Please. - God. Lucas, I am so sorry about not helping your brother, for everything. Why would you come here? Of all places. I didn't know this is your church. So this is just a coincidence? - No. No, it's not. - Caitlin, honey... Then why are you here? I have seen things and felt things since that day in the park, and I thought coming here would make sense of it all. What are you talking about? It's hard to explain. I keep seeing the number 27. Douglas and I, we were both born on the 27th, and that quote has a 27. And I've felt this presence. You mean, like, Douglas's presence? Yeah. I felt it too. - You have? - Yeah. And I think I've seen Doug. A glimpse in the crowd, a figure out of the corner of my eye. My doctor said it was, it was just my mind trying to process the loss. I thought I was going crazy. Um... I should go, but can we meet later? Caitlin, no. Come on. Let's go. At least let me give you my phone number. In case you change your mind. Thank you. I went there for an answer. And I found one. I'm... I'm not imagining this, Lucas felt it too. He saw his brother! When my mom died, I thought I saw her everywhere. Yeah, Josh, I get that. But I'm telling you, this is different. I love you. And I love you too. What? It's Lucas. He says he wants - to meet with me. - No, no, that's not a good idea. Well, I have to tell him what's been happening. He's just going to feed your paranoia. Josh, this isn't paranoia. No, it's worse, don't you get it? You went to Curt's house that night, alone. Whoever killed him, they could've killed you too. Look, babe, I love you, but I, I can't just sit by and watch you spiral out of control. I am in control. For the first time in a long time. - Okay, I'm going to call Gateways... - No. I don't need Gateways, and I don't need you doubting me. Okay? Not now. Caitlin. Caitlin! - Hi. Uh, I am Caitlin... - I know who you are. You don't have an appointment. And you got some nerve showing your face around here. It's okay, Betty. I got this. Come with me. This was Doug's next project. Buy abandoned buildings, converting them into shelters. Let's go. Curt said he saw something. But when I asked him about Douglas, he got defensive. In your experience, did you just see something, or did you feel some sort of physical contact? Before we talk about that, I need to say something. I'm really trying to keep forgiveness in my heart for you and the others. But I need to know... why didn't you help him? There hasn't been a day that has gone by that I haven't agonized over that morning. The thought... What if I... When I told you that I lost my father... I was telling the truth. About nine months ago. Some people broke into our house... and they shot my dad. We both died. And they were able to bring me back. But not him. And... ...I blamed myself... I had a breakdown, I... So that day in the park, when I saw your brother being attacked, I went back to that morning... and I froze. All I can say is that I was weak. And scared. I am so sorry. Thank you. Well, I spent the afternoon researching spirits. And I can't believe I just said that. I mean, I'm kind of spiritual, I was sort of going to church when Douglas died. Mostly for the "reap what you sow" sermons, which is kind of like karma. What you do comes back on you. Well, karma is a force. Which means it can use people, but it can also use things. Like spirits. Well, this says what they all say. If someone dies violently, a part of them can remain in our world, like a trace or an echo, - until they're avenged. - Oh, my God. - What? - Wait, you know how I keep seeing the number 27? - Yeah. - Look. What... what does that mean? I think it means we're on the right path. You said you thought Curt may have seen something - in the park, right? - Yeah. What about the others? You're right. That is what I need to find out. Is there anything else that you remember? I told the cops everything I know. - Are you sure? Maybe you forgot something. - Yes. Is this... is this why you brought us all down here? Huh? Have you guys experienced anything weird since Douglas died? Could you be a lot more specific? Like, have you felt something ominous, like a presence? I know it sounds weird, but I've felt something since that day in the park. - Lucas has too. - Lucas? Why are you talking to him? He hates us. No, no, he doesn't, and he is really sorry - for the press conference. - Sorry? Sorry is not going to bring back Curt. I don't know what is going on with you two, but leave us out of it. I had to take Jesse out of school after that. You know, you're going to have to stop living in the past, and figure out a way to put this to rest. Like I did. You're going to drive yourself crazy. Hello? Yes? Hi. Yeah, yeah, I'll be there in a second. Are you ready? Okay. Is that him? Yeah, that is him. You sure? Yeah, that is him. Okay. Let's go. Caitlin. - You okay? - Yeah. Listen, I know words, they don't mean much, but about your brother, I am sorry. We've all done things we regret. I shouldn't have gone public with your names, put you in danger. It's our guy. Who is he? Mark Gaddis, he had a long record. Robbery, assault, possession. Cleaning crew found his body in an alley. Looks like a drug overdose. That medallion you saw was from a 12 step program. Why did he kill my brother? Uh, we found a Chapel Care card in his pocket. Think he might've known Douglas from one of these shelters. Followed him into the park to rob him. He saw you all on the news, got worried you could identify him. I am so sorry. So that is it? - It's over? - Yeah. Thank God. Wait, I don't... I don't think he killed Nathan and Curt. Please, stop it. Let's talk. - What is the matter? - I know that guy killed Douglas, - but I still... - Caitlin, this whole "reap what you sow" thing, I get it. Think about it rationally. If there really is some kind of karmic justice going on here, it shouldn't affect you. You froze because of your past. That is how karma works, right? Your intentions? You helped him. You called the police. It's over. The black gloves. - What? - When I called about the medallion the guy was carrying, you said they found black gloves in the trash can. I never told you the killer was wearing black gloves. Althea told me. Look, I know you're scared, but... don't go looking for trouble where there isn't any. You need a ride home? No. No, I'm good. - Hey. - Where have you been? I've been calling you all day. I'm sorry for running out on you. It's okay. Are you home? Yeah. I'll be there in ten minutes. Okay. Thank you. I love you, Caitlin. I love you too. Jesus. - Hello. - It's Maria. Cait... I'm really sorry about earlier. It's just, I've been a wreck since Curt died. Did they, um... ...did they find the guy who killed Douglas? Yeah. They think he killed Nathan and Curt too. He didn't. Maria? What is wrong? I saw Douglas. Are you sure? You saw him? Yeah. And, um, Curt and me... we saw something at the park that day. Where are you? Maria? Maria? I was on your side, all this time. But you have a habit of turning up when people die. One time I can write off as a coincidence. Twice I get suspicious. Three times... Well, no one is that unlucky. So you need to be straight with me now. You think I did this? Why? Maybe guilt? Maybe, in some twisted way, you think you're making things right? No, no, no, no. Talk to Lucas, - he's seen his brother too. - He thinks he's seen him. That guy is going through hell and you're filling his head with, with ghost stories. Are you arresting me? Not yet. But CSI is going over the crime scene. Don't think about leaving town. And stay away from the other witnesses. We're putting them under 24-hour surveillance. You go near them, I'll lock you up myself. Is that clear? Get out of here. What are you doing? Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - Maria is dead. - What? - But I... I thought they found the guy. - No, I told you, it wasn't him. Okay, well, you're staying with me tonight. - And no arguing, okay? Your life is in danger. - Okay, okay, fine. Wait, how did you know that I'd be here? Uh, Boyd called. Said he brought you in for questions. Why? Caitlin, what's wrong? I, uh... Caitlin, you're... you're being silly. - I, uh... - Caitlin, open the door. Caitlin, come on, open the door. Okay, I will go get my car. Wait for me. Caitlin. Oh, my God! Oh! Althea? Althea. Althea. Hey. Hey. Althea. What happened? Was it Douglas? No, no. Love thy god with all thy heart and thy soul. And love thy neighbor as thy self. The signs are real, they're real. Twenty-seven. I thought it was a bible verse. The answers are all there. Right in front of you, if you choose to see it. But it was the chapter. You know crows are a sign of death, right? The book of Luke. You said you saw him. You lied. Help me. I know you're angry... - I know loss. - Loss? You had a lifetime with your father. Our dad? He abandoned us when we were kids. Mom drank herself to death. We ended up alone, on the streets. Do you know what happens to kids out there? Doug protected me. When I wanted to give up and check out of this miserable life, he kept me going. He was everything to me. I'm so sorry. Killing us won't bring him back. I haven't killed anyone, you did. Murder. Suicide. This? This is the gun you shot Maria with. - No. - Yes. I had her call you, lure you to the salon just like I brought you to Chapel City Cares. So you could see the buildings we're buying. This one. It's a perfect place for you to end it all. The signs were protecting me... from danger. - From you. - You're pathetic. You are so desperate to believe that there is something greater at work out there, when all there is... is a world filled with rotten selfish people... ...who think they can do whatever they want and not pay the price. If karma is real... it screwed you all over good. You going to talk us to death? Or are you going to man up and do something? All right. What you s... Caitlin! Running again? You can't shoot me and frame me. Pull the trigger, I get away, your plan goes to hell. Caitlin. Please. Please. Help! Please help me! - Caitlin! - Stop! Please! God, help me. God won't save you. There are no signs, no karma. It's just you and me. Don't make me shoot. You're a fighter. - You're a lucky lady. - It wasn't luck. I wasn't alone in there. Okay, fine, you can keep the key if it makes you feel better. Who is that? We need to go. No, we don't. But... Those guys there, um... - They're going to... - I know. It's okay. I miss you so much. I'm so sorry. Sweetheart, this wasn't your fault. I love you. I love you too. Answer the door, sweetheart. How is it going? Oh, that is right. You can't talk. Or walk. Tough break, huh? You think you were justified on what you did? Huh? Avenging Chapel City's saint? Let me tell you something... your brother wasn't no saint. I stayed in one of his shelters when I lost my house. And he promised to take care of me. One night... he came into my bedroom. And he said... "If you don't want to be on the streets with your boy... shut your mouth... and do what I say." I wasn't the only one. You were right. You said people got to own up to their own actions. I found a guy. It's amazing what people would do for $200. See, I wasn't just in the park that day for a walk. I was there to see your brother get what he deserved. I... I didn't mean for him to die. I told the guy just... just rough him up a bit. You think all these people would hate us if they knew what kind of man he really was? Would you? You and your misguided vengeance. You see where it got you? Paralyzed. And locked up for life. I guess it's true. Karma really is a bitch. Lucas. Help me.
