(speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (intense music) (suspenseful music) - Isn't this where we're supposed to meet the tour guide? Oh Helen, they-- (gasps) - Who was that, Susan dear? - I don't know. - The porter? - Now Joe, don't start. - Oh! (clattering) - Hey are you alright, man? - Yeah, wife's bag's a little heavy and the bus fumes made me a little dizzy. - Milt, put the bags down. - Alright. - The bellhop'll get 'em. - Well, the Hollys are here. Boy I sure could go for a little nip of that Russian vodka, I'll tell you that. (clapping) (suspenseful music) - Please, leave luggage here. The porters will take them to the room. - Her warmth is overwhelming, don't you think? - She can warm me up anytime she likes. - You must check into hotel, please. Thank you. (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) - [Susan] Could you save my place, Helen? I'll be right back. - [Helen] Of course, dear. (speaking in foreign language) - I'll take them. - Thank you. - Thank you. (speaking in foreign language) - 30 rubles. - 30, right, sorry. - Yeah? - How's the tour? - Great. - Come from Moscow? - Yeah, yeah, it was great. I mean I'd rather be on my own, but... - At least you have a phrasebook. Once I get past borscht and strobanoff, stroganoff, you see, I'm useless. - Well it's a difficult language. So you're not with the tour? - No, I wish. Monday I'm due at the Ruske Bank in Moscow. So that leaves me the whole weekend to see all of beautiful St. Petersburg. - That's all the time we have too. - Well at least you've got somebody to show you around. - You could always tag along with us if you'd like. I'm Susan Dennison. - Grant Ames. (suspenseful music) (cries out) (dramatic music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (water running from faucet) (buzzer buzzes) - Be right there! (suspenseful music) Hi! - Hi, you ready? - Yeah, just about. I gotta grab my stuff, come on in. - Sure. Well you have a great view from this room. - Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, so I don't forget anything. (suspenseful music) Key, camera bag, purse, and that's it. - You want me to take that for you? - Oh, great, thanks. Let me get Joe and Helen, okay? They're just across the hall. (suspenseful music) (knocks) Hello in there. - [Helen] Come on in. - Hey you two, the bus leaves in five minutes. - Oh hi Susie dear. We decided to stay in this afternoon. We're just not as young as we used to be. - Speak for yourself, Helen. - Well is there anything I can do? - Bring me that tour guide, Viktoria? (laughing) - You wouldn't know what to do with her if you had her, Joe. Ooh, a handsome stranger. You could introduce us, dear. - Grant Ames, Helen and Joe Meadows. Grant's coming with us this afternoon. - Nice to meet you both. You sure we can't convince you to join us? - You take good care of Susie, you hear? - Yes sir. - Okay well I'll see you guys later. Take care, get some rest, alright? - Okay, have a good time. We'll be fine. (singing in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - I know she's coming. - Alright, alright, I'll save her a seat. - [Molly] Well there she is now! - Hey Susie! - Hi guys! - [Milt] How you doing, how's it going? - [Susie] Good, how you doing, Milt? - Well, raring to go. Hey, let me ask you a question, Susie. Is it me or is the plumbing here kinda funny? When you flush your toilet, does it make a sound like stepping on a tail of a dog, kind of like (howling). - Milt. - Hey, buddy, how goes it? Welcome aboard, you must be the new member of the tour. My name is Milt Holly and this is my wife here, Molly Holly. It rhymes, kinda like holy moly. (laughs) - Grant Ames, nice to meet you both. Molly, let me help you out with that thing. - [Molly] Why thank you! - It really wasn't that heavy. - Here, I threw that, you want me to put this bag maybe underneath the seat? - Oh sure. Just wanna get a shot of the hotel. - [Grant] From the looks of all this stuff you must really know what you're doing. - Not really. I'm a typical American though, I wouldn't dream of having a hobby without going state of the art. - [Milt] Hey Susie, you pay retail for that? - Yeah, why? - Well my brother Ed's got a store in Dallas. - Hmm. - I don't think Hillary was this well-equipped at Mount Everest. - [Susan] I've gotta get this other lens. (speaking in foreign language) - This was original fortress built on the Neva River. (suspenseful music) This fortress of Peter and Paul is of great historical importance. It was originally built as a prison and a fortress. It contains the remains of all the tsars. With the exception of the last tsar, Nicholas II. The body of Peter the Great is here. Please, follow me. - So these are the rulers of old Russia. - I think I prefer Mount Vernon and Monticello myself. - Yeah but there's a sense of romance and adventure over here that I never felt in the States. Russia's fascinating. - [Grant] Do you travel very much? - Not as much as I'd like. The school year does not end for teachers in June, let me tell you. (laughs) - You teach, you teach, what do you teach? - Algebra, trig. - Hmm. - Yeah. The really exciting stuff. - You know, this reminds me a lot of Graceland. Remember that trip to Memphis where you got sick on them cheese corn dogs? - Corn dogs? I don't know what you're talking about. - Well, I do. You barfed twice in the car. - I don't remember anything. - Well that's as usual. (speaking in foreign language) - We now come to the area where the tsars would imprison those whom they did not trust. Even their own family. In this room, Peter the Great's own son Alexei was imprisoned and tortured for defying his rule. - My goodness, talk about getting grounded for the weekend! - Hey honey. (shackles clanking) Remember that night in the motel? - Would you shut up? I don't remember no motel! - Alright. - Okay? - Sorry. - Look at this crossbow. Must be 300 years old. (suspenseful music) Wonder if it still works. Hey Grant, stand next to this thing, I'll get a picture. - No, I've got a better idea. Let me take a picture of you here with these guys. - Okay, okay great, that'd be good. There you go. - Yeah, stand next to the red monk there. (dramatic music) Hey! Hey! Hey! - Oh. - I'm sorry Susan. (engine rumbling) - Unfortunately, you have just had demonstration of why it is necessary to keep close watch on all personal belongings. Please. - Well I think I'll get a cab and see if I can't pick up another camera. - Yeah, right. - Do you have any plans? - Well, I'm expecting a fax from New York back at the hotel. - Oh, of course, business, yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Will I see you at dinner? - Absolutely. So long. (mysterious music) (horns honking) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) - Joe! Hey, Helen! Hey, Joe! Oh. (speaking in foreign language) Hi. Helen, Joe! Joe? Oh, hi. Uh, English, you speak English? (speaking in foreign language) I'm looking for my friends, Joe, Helen. You were with them. Are they here? Oh, oh Father, Father, excuse me. Father, do you speak English? - Can I help you? - Yes, oh yes please. I'm looking for my friends, Joe and Helen. This man was with them. Could you translate please? (speaking in foreign language) - He knows nothing. - No but he was just with them, I just saw him. (speaking in foreign language) - He does not know any Americans. - That's impossible, I saw him on the street talking with them. And then he was just with them now. Hey, hey. Hey! Father. What is going on here? (suspenseful music) - Pretty lady, pretty lady, I have icons, pictures of saints. Pins, medallions. - No, no thank you. - Ah, you American! Look, very beautiful, very cheap. - I'm not interested, thank you. - You come to Russia, see beautiful things, da? You come with me now, I show you many beautiful things. - No please, I'm trying to read. Please, leave me alone. - What you read? American book? You want have, I am very young, very strong. Very unusual. - I'm sure you are, I'm not interested. Thank you. - Pretty lady, pretty lady. - No, no, please, leave me alone, thank you. (suspenseful music) Oh god. Oh no! (murmuring) Excuse me, do you speak English? (speaking in foreign language) Excuse me, do you speak English? - Yes. But only a little. - Can you tell me what happened? - This would not be interesting for foreigners. Excuse me. (speaking in foreign language) - Ah, hi! - Helen, Joe! Thank God you're alright, I was so worried about you! - Oh my goodness. - I saw you on the street this afternoon and then at the church. Didn't you see me? I yelled to you. - Why no dear. - Oh and then when that priest was murdered, I-- - Murdered? - Oh you don't know about it. Oh, oh I had just talked to him. - Oh, how awful. - What a world. - Yeah. I thought you guys weren't gonna go out. - Well I bounced back and the wife said let's go. So we go. (chuckles) - Well, the important thing is that you're okay. - Ah yes, I'll feel a lot better with that Russian tour guide. - Ooh! (laughs) - Hey, who was that man you were talking to? (suspenseful music) - What man? - The one on the street, he was the creepy-looking guy from the lobby this morning. - I don't remember anyone in particular. Do you, Joe? - Well maybe it was someone we asked directions. - Hiya, hey everyone, hey, how you doing? - Hi. - Hey Joe, hey Joe, you won't believe it. They got a nightclub down there, it's amazing. It's like one of these bars with these tassel bars where they twirl and all that. It's like being in Las Vegas. - No kidding. - Well listen you guys, I'm gonna go freshen up. Catch you later. - We'll save you a place at the table. - Hey, listen. You won't believe what else happened. This afternoon, this little Russian boy comes up to me and he wants to sell me one of them Davy Crockett hats with hair on it. - Did it have a tail? - Um, no. - Was it dead? - Yeah, I believe it was. - He offered him 1,000 rubles for it. - Well it looked very nice on me and plus I was just trying to jack up the global economy. (laughs) - Well let's all jack it up. (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) (elevator dings) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - You've been going through my things, I need to know why. - I was just... - What are you doing here, Susan? - I saw you coming out of Helen and Joe's room and then you were speaking Russian with their maid so I didn't know... I was... I couldn't... - Just calm down. Sit. (mysterious music) Everything's okay. But you must tell me what you've seen. - I saw a Russian passport. Are you a Russian? - I'm as American as you are, it's a cover. - You're a spy! You're watching Helen and Joe! - Cold War's over, haven't you heard? Before I tell you anything more you have to swear to me that no matter what I say you'll keep it in the strictest of confidence. Understand I can hold you to it. - I swear. - I'm with the United States Customs Service working jointly with Interpol. Since the break up of the Soviet Union, my Russian counterparts and I have been following the activities of the St. Petersburg Monarchist Society. A bunch of old folks trying to whip up support for a return to the rule of the tsars. To the Romanov dynasty. Well, they're trying to get the tsar's icon out of Russia. - The tsar's icon? It's valuable? - It is to the monarchists. It's a symbol they can rally behind. To the Russian government, it's a valuable piece of their history and to the rest of the world it's just a small piece of religious art, easily concealed, worth about two million bucks. (suspenseful music) - And the Meadows are trying to steal it. - Mm, not exactly. You see, Helen Meadows fancies herself a far distant relative of the last tsar. So they're loyal monarchists. The Meadows are trying to find the icon and see to it the monarchists get it safely abroad. - So they don't have it yet? - No, no, no, no, those old monarchists are very cagey. You see, the icon is in a church somewhere in St. Petersburg, but no one person knows which church or where it is in the church and the Meadows are piecing the puzzle together bit by bit and I'm just trying to keep up with them. - That man from the cathedral, I saw them with him on the street today. (suspenseful music) - What did he look like? - Tall, skinny guy, he was all dressed in black, he had a ponytail. - And eyeglasses like Coke bottles. - [Susan] Yeah, yeah, you know him? - Only by reputation. I saw him in the hotel this morning. - So did I. - Did you? His name's Igor Blitzkov, he used to be big time with the KGB. Now he's St. Petersburg mafia. - Really, they have a mafia here? - Oh yeah. I bet he's convinced Joe and Helen that he's a monarchist too. Well believe me, he's not, he's only out for the icon for himself. They're playing with a very tough customer. - So what do we do? - We? Not a chance. - Why not? I wanna do my part. - Look. This isn't James Bond. Everything is not gonna turn out okay in the end. Three people have already been murdered, including a maid in this very hotel. - But Helen and Joe trust me. I know I could help. (bangs) - Absolutely not, Susan. - Look, I'll be with them anyway. All I'll do is I'll stick real close to them and I'll tell you who they talk to, where they went. It's gotta help you, right? (suspenseful music) - You know, everything inside of me tells me I should go over there and pick up that phone, call the embassy and have you shipped home before you get yourself in real trouble. - But you're not going to, right? - You'll do exactly as I say. - Girl scout's honor. - What am I doing? Still, you would give me the perfect cover. - Yeah. - I'm not gonna be on the tour tomorrow to the Summer Palace. I want you to keep an eye on the Meadows. But no matter what you do, I don't want you to find yourself alone with them, do you understand? - Fine, alright. - Do you understand? - Yes. Yes. - 'Kay. (suspenseful music) - The Summer Palace was Peter the Great's lasting monument to the city he built and home to many other tsars. Including the last tsar, Nicholas. We are now on the grand staircase of the Summer Palace which was built by the tsars in 1751. This room, commonly known as the gold room, is where Catherine II would receive petitions of a private nature. - Must be worth more than Fort Knox. - Oh my, yes! - Maybe we should make them an offer. - How much you got in your purse? (laughs) - Oh, you're not feeling faint again, are you Joe? - What is it Joe, you got the runs? - [Helen] You want me to call a cab and we'll go back to the hotel? - I think that's a good idea. - Let me help. - No, that's alright dear, we can manage. - No, no, I want to, let me come. - No, no, I wouldn't hear of it. - You stay here and enjoy yourself, we'll get a cab. - Are you sure? - Positive. Oh, you're an angel. (smooches) - You know Joe oughta get himself some Zs. (mysterious music) (speaking in foreign language) - And now we are in the grand hall. This is the actual throne of Peter the Great. The throne was also used by Catherine the Great in the hall to receive official delegations, ambassadors. - Do you believe that? - The hall was also-- - That was Peter the Great's. - Big deal, it's just a chair. - No, that was his actual throne. - Yeah, if it's his throne, where's the toilet paper and the magazines? (mysterious music) - That's it, Joe. (suspenseful music) Come on Joe, come on! (shushes) (speaking in foreign language) Careful Joe, careful! - [Joe] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. - Come on Joe, come on. Here, here. (gasps) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - We're nearly there, Helen. - We don't have much time, someone's onto us. - Quit your bellyaching. No one knows we're here. - And the priest? - He was doing his duty. He was careless, that's all. - He was a good man, he didn't deserve to end up dead. - There are some things more important than life. Here. (suspenseful music) - Oh, there's a man, a man is following me! (speaking in foreign language) No, I, oh! (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (screams) (horses neighing) (screaming) Help me! Stop! (speaking in foreign language) (crashing) Stop! Stop! (horses neighing) Oh, oh my god, oh, oh. That man Igor was chasing me. He had a knife. Oh my god, I'm shaking. Oh jeez, I'm shaking. Oh god. - [Detective] So, Ms. Dennison. Tell me once more please how all this happen. - [Susan] Well, it's really like I said. I mean, I was just sitting there waiting for a ride and the horses just took off. I don't know what happened. (speaking in foreign language) - Your guide told that everything was as you say. (speaking in foreign language) - I don't know what you told him, but whatever it was, thank you. - Don't mention it. Please, our bus is waiting. Dinner will be served at hotel. - I wonder what she told him. - I thought we were agreed you weren't gonna be alone with them. You could have gotten yourself killed. - But I didn't, thanks to you. I couldn't believe how you handled those horses. You were amazing! - I was pretty good, wasn't I? - Incredible. But why didn't you want me to tell that detective anything? Aren't you working with the Russian police? - Well not with the locals. If I had to answer to every law enforcement goon in town I'd never get anything done. - Hmm. So do you know what was on that page they cut out from the book? - I have a pretty good idea. - Well are you gonna tell me? - I don't know. If you're nice to me. - Is that so? - Mm. (Russian music) (singing in foreign language) (applauding) - My mother taught me that. - And Helen taught me. - Really, really? - You know Grant, it was a miracle that you were able to stop that horse. - It was just dumb luck. - No, you were very courageous. - The most important thing is is you're safe and sound. And looking especially lovely. (Russian music) Would you make an old man's night? - I'd be delighted. - Not too fast, Joe. - What? - Well? - Oh, alright. Let's dance, I guess. - Yeah. - Ow! Those high heels. - Oh, come on. - Alright, alright, alright. - May I have the honor? - Oh, I couldn't. - Oh come on. Let's show 'em how it's done. - But I haven't danced in 30 years. - That was the last time the band learned a new tune. Come on. (laughing) - Let's do it. - Oh, you've done this before. (laughing) - Don't tell Helen. I was voted the best dancer for the class of '43. - '43, well that puts you right in sync with the band. - Just what were you doing in that carriage? - I was just sitting there, the horse just took off. - Oh. You're not some sort of spy, are you? (laughing) I'm just pulling your leg, Susie. No really, you shouldn't go where they don't want you to go. They get mighty hot under the collar. - Joe, I really don't know what you're talking about. - May I cut in? - Ooh. Thank you. - Oh, so? - She doesn't know a thing. (speaking in foreign language) You may end up being Grand Duchess after all. (suspenseful music) - One more minute and I would have screamed. - The band could use a break. - I think he's onto me. He was asking me a lot of questions. Yeah. But he also suspects Viktoria. God, thinking of Viktoria, do you think she's lying to the police? - Oh, the tour guide. No, I doubt it. - That page they cut from the book. Do you suppose it was a map of the church? - Probably, don't worry about it. - Oh, I could go back to that library and maybe pick up a clue. - Bad idea. (laughs) - You're distracting me. - I certainly hope so. - Is this the part where the conspirators have a meeting of the minds? - Or something. - I hope this isn't gonna be a problem.

You? - Oh I tossed and turned. - Hmm, is that right? - For some reason I just couldn't get comfortable. - Probably just miss your own bed. - No, I don't think that was it. - Whoa. (laughs) - So where are Joe and Helen, did they eat yet? - I don't know, they're usually the first ones up. - I will check. But in 15 minutes we must leave to drive to Pushkin. - Milt. - Huh? - I think you left the camera in the room again. - Nope, you're wrong, look, I got the camera right here. Hey Susie, let me ask you, on the bus today-- - Milt, I need to get a sweater. - Oh, sweater, yes, well it's always cold in Russia, better get your sweater. - We'll see you guys on the bus. - Say, what the hey, you're on vacation. (suspenseful music) - I missed you this morning. - I had to leave. I thought you might like to keep things quiet. - Mm, you're sweet. - No, you're wonderful. (suspenseful music) - Excuse me, Ms. Dennison. I must tell you, Helen and Joseph Meadows, this morning, return to America. - What? - They left a note. They say goodbye to everyone and they apologize for leaving so soon. - I can't believe that! How could they just go? Did Joe get sick? - Uh, they left no other details. Excuse me, I will go and tell the others. (suspenseful music) - Grant! Darn. That red car, follow the car please. (speaking in foreign language) There he goes. Where is he? Oh there he is, there he is. Oh, that's it, good, follow him. You understand, you understand? Follow that car? - I understand. - There he is. There he is, yeah. Oh watch it, watch it, watch it! (tires squealing) Careful, careful. - All good. - Not too close. Slow down up here. (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) Okay, good, stay here now, wait here. I'll be right back. - All good, yes. (speaking in foreign language) - No, wait, wait! - Wait. Wait, why are you so impatient? The situation we have here is so difficult. I've been doing exactly what we planned but I don't have it, not yet. - What do you mean, you don't have it yet? Will you stop screwing around? We had a deal, Blitzkov! - You Americans are always so quick with blaming others. - I did my part. Bottom line. - You'll have it tomorrow night. - I'd better. - But I am worried. This American woman. (suspenseful music) - The situation's under control. - That's exactly what Gorbachev said a week before the coup. I don't trust her at all. Get rid of her. - She's a US citizen. If anything happens to her, the embassy will be down around our ears. - Perhaps I should handle it. - Yeah, well perhaps when I no longer need her I'll take care of her myself. - As you wish. (branch snaps) (dramatic music) - Susan! Susan, stop running! Let me explain, come on! Susan, Susan, stop! Susan. - Let go of me! - Don't run away. Shh. Shh. - I heard everything. You're a criminal, just like him. - Yeah that's exactly what he thinks. It's taken me eight months to win Blitzkov's confidence. I am so close I can taste it. Once he gives me one more piece of evidence I'll have the whole mafia ring broken. Then I can go home. We can go home. - Why should I believe you? - Because I'm telling you the truth. Because I love you. (suspenseful music) I want us to have a future together, Susan. - Oh, oh Grant. You do? (sighs) You do. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Very nicely done, my friend. And now, move away from him. Go. - Don't do it, Blitzkov. You'll blow the whole deal. - Stalin knew it best. (cocks gun) You Americans are soft. - You're acting like a dumb Russian here, Blitzkov. She's got $500,000 hard currency in the hotel safe. You kill her, we won't be able to move the merchandise. Why do you think I keep her around? - You'll never get your hands on my money! - Shut up! (hits) (cries out) - Watch it. Get back. - What do we need him for? I'm the one with the money. If you can supply the icon, let's make a deal. - What's she talking about? - Don't listen to her, you need me. - Shoot him, go ahead, shoot him! Shoot him! - Shut up. - Go on, shoot him! - Let me think. - Take your time. What you need to do now is think, think it through. That's what's you need to do now. - Stand back. - Think. Think it through. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (empty gun clicking) Blitzkov. (neck snaps) (suspenseful music) - Oh. - You were terrific! - Oh, thanks. - Knocking his glasses off like that. - I was aiming for his gun. What are you looking for? - Just information. Ah. Help me. - What? - Susan, listen to me. Blitzkov was a cold-blooded killer, he won't be mourned. Here, take his other arm. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (splashes) (groans) Oh my god. - Easy. Now I've got one more thing to do then the last piece of this puzzle will drop into place. We were never here, understand? Do you understand? - Yes, yes. - Let's go. (mysterious music) - So, is it as good with her? - That's business, I don't confuse the two. (giggles) Ah. (whistling) - So many churches in Russia look alike. This could be anywhere. - Let me see the paper. Ah. I'll find it. - You know, when Blitzkov's people discover his body, they will come after both of us. - Mm, well by then we'll both be on a plane. - And the woman? - What about her? - You picked the wrong one this time, she's too smart. - I picked her? You're the one who put the tsar's pin in her camera case. - That was emergency. You could have picked someone else. - Jealousy. Something new for you. - Don't be ridiculous. - We still need her. - And then? - I'll snap her neck. - [Viktoria] Hmm, the glory of the Russian people. - But sure, take it out of Russia, baby. (speaking in foreign language) - [Susan] Is that the paper you pulled of Blitzkov's body? What's it say? - Well, just the name of this church, this market, and today's date. - Hmm. - We're looking for one particular guy. - Okay, which guy? - Good question. - Oh, I see, hmm. It's just hard for me to believe that dead tsars could cause so much bloodshed. - You don't know much about tsarist Russia, do you? - I teach algebra, remember? - Well in 1918, the new socialist government executed Tsar Nicholas along with his entire family and servants. The bodies were found in a mine pit near where they were shot. Well, what was left of them anyway. They'd been chopped into little pieces and burned with acid. - Mm, thank you for sharing that with me. - Uh huh. History's a brutal subject. Russian history is particularly brutal. The tsar's icon was originally presented to the Tsarina Alexandra by none other than Rasputin himself, the mad monk. - Oh. - She was so in love with her husband that she gave it to him even though her own faith was far stronger. That's it. - Hey, do you want to buy something? (speaking in foreign language) Sorry. - Get out there and sing. - What? - Anything, anything. I gotta get this guy alone.

(laughing) - I'm just warmed up. - The mafia has eyes everywhere, let's go, come on. - You're hurting me. (suspenseful music) Grant. Oh look, there's Milt! - Hey, hey Susie. Wait a minute! - This is it. Let's go. (mysterious music) - It's beautiful. - Blitzkov said it was behind the door hanging on a wall, so... - Is that where it's supposed to be? Whoa. Oh no, it's gone. - Blitzkov. He double-crossed me. (scoffs) - And there's nothing you can do? - No. (suspenseful music) - Oh honey, I'm sorry. - Well. If it hadn't been for you, I couldn't have come this far. - Don't say that. Maybe if I hadn't been around you'd have it by now. - No. I owe you more than you'll ever know. - And now it's over. I am so sorry. - Yeah. I'm sorry too, Susan. Let's go. I told you I'd snap her neck when I was through with her. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Grant? - [Molly] It's Molly, we need to talk to you. - Oh Molly, I'm not dressed. Can I meet you downstairs? - [Molly] It'll just take a moment. It's kind of important. - Okay, hang on. What is it? - Can we come in, Susan? - Well I'm just getting ready for dinner. - So it shouldn't take long. - What's the matter? - [Molly] You better sit down, Susan. - Susan, I'm afraid you've gotten yourself into something that's pretty serious. - What's going on here? - Well first of all, I'm not Milt. My name is John Mulwray, and this is Vanessa Anderson. And we both work for Interpol. It's part of a joint Russian-American surveillance unit and we've been after your pal Grant for the past two years. - His real name is William Cassidy. - We found Blitzkov's body floating in the river at the palace. We got there before the police, but not before Cassidy got what he wanted. - He killed that old man at the flea market while you were singing. - Oh my god. I don't believe this. - [John] We also have to assume he's responsible for the murder of Helen and Joe Meadows. - What are you talking about? They went back to the States. - No one using that passport ever cleared customs. Susan, it's true. - I suppose he told you he was after this? - The tsar's icon, you took it from the church. (scoffs) - As far as this goes, the Russians make these up by the thousands for the tourists. One of the monarchists was supposed to mark the medallion's location with a missing icon. - Wait a minute, what medallion? - It's got the likeness of the tsar in gold, it's about this big. It disappeared just before the revolution and it's been hidden away all these years by the Monarchist Society. - You see Susan, this medallion is worth between $3 million and $5 million. And even in a slow market, Cassidy could get 2.5 million without even trying. (scoffs) - No wait a minute, this whole thing doesn't make any sense. I never saw any medallion, I don't buy this. - Susan, you're not the first pretty American woman he's used. He's been working petty scams for years. - This is just a bigger scheme. - Then why don't you arrest him? - Because we don't have any proof. - Yes you do. I saw him kill that man Blitzkov at the palace. - I mean the most the Russians could do is just deport him. Meanwhile, Cassidy's still got the medallion and it's our job to link him to it. - Tonight's your last night in Russia. He's gonna try to slip the medallion into your bag to get through customs. Once you get to Kennedy, he's going to get you alone, take the medallion, and at that point-- - At that point, you're a dangerous witness. - Excuse me, I think I'm gonna be sick. (faucet running) - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Why don't you sit down? - Okay, what do you want me to do? - Well first, don't panic. Wherever you go, we'll be there. He doesn't wanna hurt you, 'cause he needs you, at least for now. - Okay. Well we're supposed to be having dinner together tonight. - Well that's good. - Look we know he's been sleeping in your room so when you go to bed tonight, don't lock the door and we'll take care of everything else. (scoffs) - I can't, I can't sleep with him now after knowing all this. - You don't really have a choice, Susan. If Cassidy knows you're onto him, you'll never live til morning. - And if they catch you at customs with that medallion... Even we can't help. You'll spend the rest of your life in a Russian jail. (Russian music) (singing in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - What's the matter? You seem so distracted. You usually like Russian ice cream. - Oh, I'm just sad, I guess. I just can't believe I'm going home tomorrow. - I've had very good news. I've been reassigned stateside. We're gonna be on the same plane together. And when we land, I'm gonna take you out for the best dinner in all of New York, hmm? (laughs) - That sounds great. And I guess you'll be arresting Joe and Helen. - They've been taken care of. - The way you say it it almost sounds like they were dead. - They have a lot to answer for. - Um... And what about the tsar's icon? - I'm afraid the trail has gone cold. But it's not my problem anymore. Or yours. Now, we have our whole future together. Just the two of us. Eh? Unless you're tired of me already. (laughs) - Oh. - Huh? - No, of course not. Of course not. - No. Come on. I got a special place to show you. I think you'll like it. - Now? - Mm hmm. - But I promised Molly we'd have a drink with them, a last drink. - As soon as we get back, this won't take long. - Oh, Grant. You're hurting me. - Am I? I'm sorry sweetie. (suspenseful music) - It's so late, where are we going? - It's a surprise. Come on. You know, my mother once told me you never truly appreciate anything until you're about to lose it. Russia is truly the land of opportunity. Like the Old West. These people are smart. And they're learning fast. But they're much too trusting. They have hope. We have the edge. Oh. Here. This is for you. - What is it? - Open it. (laughs) - It's beautiful, what is it? - It's my retirement. It's the Nicholas medallion, it's worth a fortune. But I guess you know all about it now. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Susie, Susie. Susan, we had a chance. Viktoria was a nobody. I needed her, I used her. But you're different. I wanted to love you. - Grant, stop it. You don't know what you're saying. - You think your friends from Interpol are gonna help you now? (dramatic music) (gasps) - Oh my god! Oh my god. - You know I never suspected them? Sure, I thought the local dick would be snooping around sooner or later, but he's no problem. They're supposed to be pros. Huh? - Let me out! - Susie. Susie, I was ready to give it all up. This round would bring in a couple of million, easy, and we could have lived high and wide on that for a long time. But you just didn't want to play along, did you? Hmm? You still can, you know. It's not too late. We can live like kings. Or tsars. (brakes squealing) (suspenseful music) - Please let me go. Please Grant, I won't tell anyone anything, I promise. - We had our fun. Didn't we? Didn't we? - Yes. - Alright, get out. - Please. Please. - Get out. (breathing heavily) - Grant! (grunting) (dramatic music) - Please, please, give me a chance to explain! (gun firing) Is this our first lover's quarrel? Oh come on, let's kiss and make up, huh? Ha! I love you, Susan. Come on sweetie, can't we talk? (knocks) (whistles) Can Susie come out and play? (dramatic music) (gun fires) I know you're here, Susan. (suspenseful music) There's only one way out. But we have a future, baby, once I dump the medallion, we'll be rich. We can go anywhere we want. Wanna go to, uh, Tahiti, we'll go. Paris. You got it, sweetie. I can't wait for you to meet my mother. Her memory's not so good anymore. But I know she'll like you. Oh, I forgot. She's dead. (scoffs) Time's up. Game's over. You lose. (dramatic music) (groaning) - My god. - That was genius. (breathing heavily) (coughing) (dramatic music) You play rough, teacher.
