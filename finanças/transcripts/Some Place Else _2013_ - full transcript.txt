OK, stop! Stop right there. - What is it, Vincent? - You screwed me! Vincent... I should be in here! Vincent, you have to leave now! What is it, Vincent? Please. I should be in here. You won't get away with it. Let's go outside, we'll talk later. No, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. - Vincent, that's enough. - No. Why is she here, and not me? - Mr Dabler. - What? - Get out now! - No. No, I'm not going! I'm staying here. Vincent, stop! Call an ambulance! A FORTNIGHT AWAY Can you answer me? Mr Dabler? Mr Dabler? I'm worried about you. What you did was very serious. I'll be back in a minute. - Mrs Dabler? - Yes. Your husband is in shock. He tried to injure himself at work. - Where is he? - Just through there. Mrs Dabler, I'm worried he'll do it again. Have you noticed anything unusual lately? - It's tough at the moment. - In what way? He doesn't listen, he criticises everything I do. I can't discharge him like this, it's too dangerous. He needs rest and specific treatment. You should ask for him to be admitted. I don't understand. I need your permission to send him to a psychiatric unit. A psychiatric unit? I can't do that. It's the only solution, believe me. - I want to see him. - Yes, of course. - What happened? - I'm OK, it's over now. I want to go home now. Mr Dabler, you need rest and hospital care. No, no. I feel fine now, I'm going home now. - You need help. - No. - Here. Take this. - No, I will not. I'm not taking it. Come on, let's go home. - Let's go. - Mrs Dabler, sign here. Mr Dabler, sit down! If you don't take the tablets, we will give you an injection. I want to go home. I want to go home! - Here, Mr Dabler. - No! - Mr Dabler, take the medicine. - No! Come on, calm down. Here. There you go. We'll look after you. Don't worry. Good. I want to go home. Hello, Mr Dabler. Come on. EIGHT DAYS LATER Hélène! The wheelchair is not a toy. - OK, Lionel, I'm not breaking it. - Get out! It's not a toy. Have some respect. Walk a bit, it will do you good. You don't look very well, mate. Are you new here? It's OK if you don't want to talk, I'm just the opposite. Have you got a smoke? You're useless. Everyone smokes here, it's all there is to do. Come on, let's go for a walk. Come with me. In the secure care wing, they didn't even let you outside. Hey, did they put you on pause on something? What drugs did they give you? Haldol? Risperdal? Loxapac? I don't know. That's Lynn. Looks like she's tried another suicide attempt. Wait here a minute. Doctor! I need to get out, I've asked to see the judge... Miss Marchand, I let you come to this wing on condition you stay calm, and it seems to be working. But can I get out? Continue with your treatment and we'll see. I can take medicine at home, I need to work... We'll talk about it during your consultation. She does my head in. Do you know why I'm fine today? I didn't take my medicine. Otherwise I'd look like that. It seems you like boxing. You're right, we have to fight. What's your name? Vincent. Hélène. Mr Dabler, time for your appointment. Don't tell him too much. He won't understand anyway. You want a coffee? Yes, please. - Sorry, I overslept. - They'll wait. - Thanks. - You're welcome. How's Vincent? He's coming out this week. That's great. You must be relieved. What is it? - Florence? - It wasn't a car accident. He's in a psychiatric hospital. He wanted to kill himself. Shit. - Promise you won't tell anyone? - I promise. He refused to go. The doctors asked me to decide for him, I'm not sure I should have. I don't know what else to do. You need to protect yourself. Setraline to be continued. Slept a lot, no excessive anxiety. Now stable, he can go home. Yes? How are you, Mr Dabler? Have a seat. I wanted to check this dosage. - Yes, I increased it yesterday. - OK, doctor. How are you, Mr Dabler? You've responded well to treatment. Are you sleeping well? You should go for walks in the afternoons, and eat with the others, but I'm putting you on self-care. What do you mean? You can go home. In three days. How do you know I'm OK? You've only seen me once. According to the nurses, you're calm, the treatment suits you. There's no need for us to keep you here. But I can't leave now, I can't. You don't want to go? But when you first arrived, you were refusing to be admitted. I understand you'll need to talk to a therapist, but do it outside the hospital. - You're kicking me out? - No, but there's no need to keep you. Go to the nurses' office for your things. Muriel will discharge you. You can't ask me to do this, it's extortion. I don't decide the prices, Jacques. I'm afraid I can't help it. I've supplied your shops for 15 years. But a 13 percent reduction - is impossible for me. - Jacques, I have bosses too. What do I tell them? We pay Jacques 13 percent more than the Spanish because he's nice! Just a minute. Guillaume. Hold on. Can you hear me? I'm with the Lazslo from France Veg. - And? - I'm squeezing him. Did he say "I've supplied you for 15 years"? Yeah, he did, but he's about to give in. I better go before he starts crying. See you later. Jacques! Come over here. I have to go. Are we OK about the new terms? - You'll make it up in volume. - If I sell it at that price, - I'll be bust in a year. - Would you rather be bust now? Jacques, it'll be OK. We'll think of something. I'll send the contract tonight. Don't let me down. Astrid, start looking for suppliers to replace Lazslo, he won't survive the year. Wow! A smartphone! You're lucky. They took mine away. Don't cry like that. Talk to me, it'll do you good. Tell me something. Tell me something. What's going on in your head? Right now. They want me to leave, I don't want to. I don't want anything, except to stay here. Shit, that is serious. You can go, but you don't want to. I want to go, and they won't let me. I've nothing out there. Haven't you got a wife? I can't even make love to her anymore. Everything I used to like has gone. I feel empty inside. What's your job? I'm a buyer for large retail outlets. Superstores. I thought I'd be glad to get out, but actually I'm scared. It really scares me. I swear I'm scared. I'm scared. Can you keep a secret? Just between you and me, OK? This is my son... Lucas. He's beautiful, isn't he? They won't let me see him. That fucking judge put him with a foster family. But he's my son. They've no right to take him, I won't let them. How old is he? Almost six. That's why I need to get out of here. Haven't you got any kids? Was that your idea or your wife's? Seriously, you should have a kid. Having a kid is totally cool, a kid helps you live. Only he loves you like that, and it's for life. Cheer up, you remind me of my son when he's sulking. I have to do my funny face. Come on, let's go see the others. Hurry up! Come on. Let's go. - Are you hungry? - No. No? Well, try to eat something. Just have a pancake and leave the rest. Any news about the judge? Petresco said I could see him. - Do you know when? - We'll let you know. Who's going to pay my rent? The social worker deals with that. I'll get you an appointment. - Michel, are you OK? - There's a phone! - The radio waves... - It's switched off. It's switched off. OK? Michel, you can eat it, it's not poisoned. He had a fit yesterday, they put him in the cage. - The cage? - It's a prison. People disappear. No, Michel. It's the isolation room. You can't lock up a child, so why do they lock us up? So they can't hear us. We scare them. Right, Michel? Mr Dabler, this is for you. What is it? Your discharge. It wouldn't be that difficult. Just rub out your name and put mine. You could say I stole it. I need to get out, Vincent, to see my son. Go on, help me out. You're horrible. I help you, then you let me down. You have no heart! You're a fool! Do they think I'm a fool? Why didn't I get the latest forecast? Astrid gave me a mailing list, she said you already had it. Since when is Astrid your boss? Who was on the list? The managers. Oh, fucking great! Anything to do with purchasing comes through me! Got it? Astrid? Astrid! Do that again, I'll fire you. What? Don't talk to me like that. I'll talk to you how I want! Don't go over my head again! You're paranoid. No, let me explain. I run this department, not you. From now on, copy me into all mails. Don't do anything without asking me. Screw up again and you're out! No, Dad, I can't. I'm at work. It's difficult. Yes, in the left-hand drawer. No, I can't. Have you found them? No. What's all this mess in here? What happened to the cleaning lady? I fired her. You need to cooperate, Dad. Don't you think I have better things to be doing? Work and money is all you care about. I'm dying, and you don't even care. All right, I'm sorry. Here they are. Dad, it's not difficult. Always in the same place. Right, I have to go. Can't you stay a while? No, no... Which one is the king? Where is it? One cigarette. No, don't touch. One cigarette. Quick. Go on, where is it? It's there. Hey, Francis! - Let's do it again. - Yes. Two cigarettes. Come on, you can win. Come on, what's wrong? - Where is it? - There. - Yes. - Five cigarettes. - No. - Why not? Workshop is in five minutes. Mr Dabler, it's music therapy. Aren't you coming? No, damn it... Come back here. Vincent, come on. One, two, three... Step forward... and back... Forward... and up... back and up... Now to the side, to the side, to the side, turnaround... and one and two... Good. Now, continue like that but close your eyes. Good. Relax your bodies. And try to feel the space. OK, now open your eyes, and change partner. Come on, don't take too long. Stop that, Karim. Hélène, no! Hélène! Hélène! Put that back on. - Shall I call security? - No, no. Please, Hélène... Vincent, are you with us? He's so annoying tonight. - Are you coming to dance? - In a minute. How are you at the moment? You got personal problems? Not at all. Why do you ask? You've been a bit stressed lately. Did Astrid tell you that? I notice these things. You got any holidays coming up? I don't know. Come on, man. Set a good example. I'll be right there. What is it now? No, I'm with clients. No, I can't. No, I don't know what time. Get off my back, Florence! You OK, Mr Dabler? You need anything? - Why do you lock our doors? - So you're not disturbed. There were thefts. Michel complained. You can open it from the inside. Goodnight. Vincent! Vincent! Come with me, I need your help. - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - No, it's important. I need you. The camera. Come on. What are you doing? What is it? What do you want? I can't let the nurses hear. It's my private life. Tell me if anyone comes. Françoise, it's Hélène. Hello. Yes, I know it's late. When can I see Lucas? No, I don't think it's funny to call now. I couldn't call earlier. I'm sorry. It's not about the time. I just want to know when I can see my son. It's not up to you. It's not up to you to decide if I should stop seeing my son. - I don't care! - Mrs Marchand! Don't tell me what to do! You can't tell me what to do! I'm sick of this! I'm sick of this! Calm down, I'll give you something to help you sleep. I'm sick of this shit! Seagull... Mr Dabler, there you are, you have a visit. - Me? - Yes. My love. Are you OK? Isn't your phone working? You don't answer it. I've stopped charging it, it relaxes me. Come on, let's go outside. The union will support you, Guillaume says he'll keep you on. I bet. He'll give me some shitty job. To tell the truth, I'm not up to it. Vincent, you're a good salesman, you can bounce back. And your secretary Sabine has left messages for you. - You should call her. - What's the point? I know what I'm saying. It's over. Here. This is for you. I've taken the whole day off. We could go out somewhere, it would do us good. Is she your wife? Yes, could you leave us, please? I'll see you later. Hello. She can't understand. It's different with me, I know what's in his head. Just a minute. Come with me, Hélène. Come on. Hélène, come on. - Are you going to leave with her? - No. Wait for me. I won't be long. Who is that girl? I don't know, she just arrived. She seems fond of you. It's stupid, but she helps me. We all want to help you. Your family, your friends, we'll get involved, but... you can't stay in here. All this could rub off on you. They're not contagious. See you later, Sylvie. - Can I have a word? - Hi, Hélène. It's the first of the month. What about my rent? Come to my office tomorrow, we'll do it together. If I stay shut up in here, then I can't work, and then I can't pay my rent, if my landlord kicks me out, I'll lose my job. You're on sick leave, you still get your salary. Your boss can't sack you. He doesn't care! As the social worker, aren't you supposed to help? Come and see me tomorrow at three, OK? Can't you do anything for me? Thanks a bunch. It's really kind of you! Looks like your wife depressed you. Why not just chuck it all in? You're still young. Do something else. Isn't there anything you like doing? I love driving. Driving all night on the motorway. I love it. And the next morning, breakfast in Grimaud. Do you know it? When you arrive in the South, the air is warm and soft, it makes you feel great. In summer, I would stick my head out the window. My dad used to freak out, but I just laughed. "Don't worry, Dad, I haven't lost my head." Things started going wrong when I arrived at university. I had Brief Psychosis Disorder, you know, panic attacks. I stopped studying and got a job, and when I had a bad spell I called my mum or my sister, but after a while, they freaked out. What happened with your son? Why did they take him? According to them, I couldn't look after him. They think I'm not a good mother. Mr Dabler, wouldn't you be better off in bed? - Do you like your job? - Yes. At least here I feel I'm helping people. That's why I chose this job. I like the night shift, it's peaceful. I used to like my job too. Driving miles in my car, going to see suppliers... I felt free and relaxed. And feeling that adrenalin rush during the negotiations when you sense the other guy is going to break. You notice the little signs. That sounds pretty strange. A job where you have to break the other guy. I never thought I'd get butterflies over a meeting, or that I'd wake up in the night to answer a mail. What I like here is the human contact. In other departments, all they do is routine care and injections, they don't even have time to speak to patients. Human contact. No, no, Dad. You're going to poison yourself. You can't be on your own. Why don't you just say it? I won't go in a home, I won't end up like that. What shall we do then? You refuse everything I suggest. I have friends, neighbours... I've lived here 30 years. You don't answer the phone and you never go out. Who else visits you except me? So what? Dump the old man in a home. - Good riddance! Right? - Don't be like that, Dad. - I can afford a nice place. - No! Then stay here on your own! I will! I'm used to it! I've done it for 30 years. You know what? I'm sick of you! Mr Dabler? Are you with us? How do you cope? I don't know... It's true we're a bit stretched. There were six of us before, now there are only three. Is that why they send us home? Not enough room? He didn't say it, but... Who? The boss? No, you've got him wrong. He's a good guy. He's about to retire, he doesn't want to fight. I don't blame him. I think he might even be on anti-depressants. Shrinks like him are a dying breed. Now they take foreign doctors. They exploit them because they pay them half as much. Like Petresco? Her bible is the DSM-4. The Manual of Mental Disorders. It's actually quite simple: Each symptom has a medication. So you just fill in forms, tick boxes and give out medication. She'd make you all sleep all day long if she could. Someone's following me. I can hear his breath, it's scary. It's an attack. No, Mr Dabler, I'll handle it. Come with me, Hélène. - Don't let go of me. - No, I won't let go. I'll stay with you until you feel better. Mr Dabler, go to bed. I'll handle it. OK, sit down. Enjoy your breakfast. - Hello, Hélène. - Hello. Thanks. The judge will see you this morning. - The judge? - Yes. I'll find you. - OK. - Show me, Hélène. - Very good. - I'll be right back. Hello, Mr Dabler. Did you sleep well? How do I look? I look good, don't I? I look good. I'll explain everything and I think she'll let me go home. I'll tell her about my son and my job, she can't refuse. Can't you encourage me? Say something! Can't you see I'm nervous? These are amazing. Michel's tablets. I took two yesterday, and I slept all day and all night, out cold. Right, Michel? But is it necessary? The black gown frightens them. Doctor, you said you don't have the staff to bring them to me, so I'm here, I've given up my morning, but I cannot do this in jeans. It's an ordeal for them. I don't make the laws, I apply them. If we don't all give a little we'll get nowhere. - Is your name Hélène Marchand? - Yes, it is. You were sectioned at the request of your sister Françoise, following an altercation with her on May 18th at 9 p.m. - Is that correct? - Yes... I don't really remember. We were arguing like two sisters. She's been a bit against me ever since my son was born. She said that I wouldn't be able to look after him... After a while... You know how it is, Your Honour. Do you admit you're ill and you need medical help? No, Your Honour, I could easily continue my treatment at home. If I stay in here too long, I could lose my job. I won't be able to pay the bills... - Can you explain? - Hélène, ask the social worker. You know what bosses are like. Apparently, you stopped your treatment and you had a relapse. It's true that I stopped taking the pills, they make me gain weight and I feel ugly. It's not nice to feel ugly, nobody likes that. And another thing I don't like is that they dry your mouth out. I can't let you out if you don't take treatment. Yes, but I'm taking them now. I'm taking them. - I am. - Yes. I promise I'll continue. It's OK, I'm calm now. But I have to get out to see my son. You have children too. It's good to see them, right? We're talking about you, nothing else. In view of the medical report and this testimony, I've decided not to release you. You will have to remain here for a while longer, your psychiatrist will propose a date for release. I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Are you all in this together? Hélène, calm down! I take my pills, don't I? Give me as many pills as you like, but let me see my son. Tell me how you want me to be. I can be any way you want, just let me out of here. Sign here. - No, I will not sign! - You can always appeal. Nobody can stop me seeing my son. I want to see my son. When can I see him? I have a right to know. I'm not leaving here until you tell me when I can see my son, I have the right to know. Can you call Julien Jiroi, please? Let's go, Hélène. Come on. Come on. Shit! I'm not asking the earth. She's no right to stop me seeing my son! She's no right! Fuck! Shit! No mother would do that to her child! Calm down, Hélène. Calm down, we're here now. It's going to be OK. No! Get out! Take it easy, Hélène. - It's all right. Don't be afraid. - You have no right! Put her in isolation, prepare some Lorapac. Isolation room is taken. - Put her in the new one. - It isn't even finished. Can't we keep her here? Not in her state. It's too risky. Go. And get all this cleaned up. Don't watch, Mr Dabler. When I started working here with Dr Leonetti, we never used to put them in the isolation room. What if they're violent? I got punched at the hospital. We don't have time to calm them, there aren't enough staff. One schizo almost killed a student nurse. Don't talk rubbish. There's more chance of being killed by lightning. You were glad of our help restraining Hélène Marchand. If all we do is inject them and restrain them, it's like an asylum. If that's what Petresco wants, I won't last long here. I need the care chart for Julien Maunauray. What? You think I'm afraid? I'm not afraid of anyone. - I say what I think. OK? - Yeah, you're right. - Can I help you? - No, no. What are you doing, Mr Dabler? You can't be in here. There was a call for you. A certain Sabine, an assistant at your company. She wants to see you. You can't question Petresco's authority in front of patients or colleagues. I still think it's pointless to put Hélène Marchand in isolation. She was upset after the judge's visit, but always resorting to isolation is admitting defeat, that's not how I work. I know, but what can I do? We don't have enough staff. Hold on, please. I know you've spent a lot of time with, Hélène Marchand. But keep your distance. - Thank you, Doctor. - Hold the line. Two packets of cigarettes. - Lights. - What? Cigarettes. Hello, everybody. Please, take a seat. Who are you? Another doctor? - This is Danielle Vallon. - Hello. She's a dietician. You know that drugs often have side effects, especially weight gain, so you have to control your diet. - I'll let Madame Vallon explain. - For the meals... Can we get a chef? It's not exactly three star service. Ask the nurses. They eat here too. Please, calm down and let Madame Vallon speak. I'd like to know if we could talk about restraint and the isolation room. I want to know how you justify that, as a psychiatrist. I'll happily discuss that at our next meeting, Mr Dabler, but we're here to talk about diet. Who wants to share an experience with us? Lynn? Vincent is right, the isolation room is wrong. Yes, it's wrong to tie us up, we're not delinquents. - What's that all about? - They hit us, too. - Look. - We're not violent. - That's not true. - Yes, they hurt him. And when I was in there, they pulled my arm and it hurt. I was hungry. but they can't force me to eat something I don't want to eat. Please, Lynn. Calm down. It's OK. Sit back down. Karim, sit down. Vincent? Sabine. I wanted to come sooner. Don't worry. It's kind of you to come. Are you OK? I'm really sorry about what happened. It's not your fault. Everyone knows you're good at your job. Apparently Astrid is better. Vincent, promise you won't repeat this, because I could lose my job. I was working on the strategic review dossiers, it was 8 o'clock, everyone had gone home. I'm counting on you to solve this problem with out-of-date food. OK, we'll ask for some free stuff. - How is that Astrid settling in? - Great, almost fully trained. Good, she can stay with you. I thought she was off to marketing. She prefers purchasing. Purchasing is full, but we could keep her as a junior. You don't understand, Legalec. As of now, she's part of your team. You must have a few high earners who've served their time. I'm counting on you, Guillaume. Two days later, he started missing you off the mailings. I thought it was a mistake, so I sent you the mails, but he got angry and threatened to fire me if I didn't do as he said. I feel really bad for not telling you this before. Thanks for coming. Who is this for? That's for her! - And what about these cakes? - Brigitte. These are for you. The red ones. No, they're for Ludo. Thank you! The sweets... All right, Lynn? Look at you! You'll blow them away. You look like a prince. - Thank you. - Very handsome. I hope we won't see you again. You never know. I always say it's the last time, but I'm still here. Mr Dabler, can you come for your prescription? Are you leaving? Have you seen Hélène? Will you give her this? It's for her. You can count on it. So, Vincent, are you leaving us? Yes, Ludo. Good luck, Mr Dabler. OK, Ludo? Hélène? Hélène? Do you think it's right to lock up Hélène? You don't have an appointment, Mr Dabler. Is this justice? That would have made anyone upset. Mr Dabler, you know nothing about this patient's needs. You're not a doctor. Let us do our work. Do you think you're helping her? I just don't think the chemical straitjacket is the answer. All I can say is that you don't know her past and you're in no position to say what's right for her. Hélène Marchand was sectioned for very a good reason. She's a danger to herself and others. She can't leave until she's done a lot of work on herself. You should ask yourself why you are so keen to help her. - Can I get you something? - No, I need some air. Hello? Yes, he's home. I'm very happy. - Are you sure you'll be OK? - Yes. See you tonight. Here are some therapists that can help you. I recommend you see several before you choose. Ask Muriel for your prescription. - Thank you. - Bye. - One more thing. - Yes? I didn't say goodbye to Hélène. She's still allowed visitors. You seem better. I still don't know when I'll get out. I wanted to thank you. Without you, I'd have been bored. Take me with you. You can't ask me to do that. Nobody wants to help me. Hi, Muriel, I'm here for my prescription. - Five. - No, six. Five! - No, I'm red. - Blue. He's red. Karim, come with me for a minute? Michel, I want to ask you something. - What? - Remember when you had that fit? Where's my knight? Could you do that again, for me, please? Could you freak out like that again? - Karim, provoke him. - No. Francis, can't you start crying? Michel, why won't you help me? I've helped you plenty of times. No! Go on, Michel. - Vincent. - What are you doing? Take me with you. - No, I can't. - I need your help, Vincent. - I have to see my son. - No, I can't. I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. Hélène, why are we here? I didn't plan on being lost in the countryside. We've already been here, at least twice. Don't worry, I'll find it, I know the way. I'm allowed to breathe, aren't I? You don't know how to enjoy life. Do you know how long I was locked up? I'm not a tourist. Come on, lighten up. Here. Can't you call them? I can't remember the number, they took everything from my room. If we'd met earlier, you might have been my kid's dad. I'm just saying. You need to relax. You're not my type anyway. I was thinking, I should get a present for Lucas. A knight's costume or something. - How old is he? - Almost six. Or a cuddly toy, A cuddly pony. When did you last see him? I don't want to talk about it. That one is so cute! Can I see him? Oh, he's beautiful. He's so cute. Look at this little guy, he's perfect for a child. I'll need to see some ID. Thanks. It for our son's birthday. Good choice. He's a very gentle dog. See? I told you. My husband wasn't sure. I talked him into it. A dog is for life, don't forget that. I need a donation of 150 euros for the chip and the vaccine. Yes, OK. Hélène, where are we going? Got any water? I think he's thirsty. Do you want to see your son or not? Guess what I'm going to call him. Pills. Because you make me feel better. Hélène, I'm talking to you. I'm scared to see him again. Do you understand? After the phone call the other night, I'm scared they won't let me see him. Listen, we didn't come all this way for nothing. I'll speak to them. Do you trust me? Let's go, Pills. Vincent? Vincent? This is the Police Department, we're looking for Vincent Dabler, he was seen leaving a psychiatric hospital with a female patient. Please call us back on 01-45-82-20-00. Hello? This is Florence Dabler, you left me a message. No, not since this morning. Is that it? Let's go. Do you want me to go? Hello. Are you Lucas? Yes. Look, it's your mummy. Come here. Come closer. Hélène, what are you doing here? Are you the foster family? What did she tell you? I'm her sister. She's delusional. Lucas is my son. Hélène! Hélène! It's a miracle she wasn't killed. I don't want to see her again. I've done all I can for her. But it's too hard. She's ruined my life, and my son's. Last time, she kept saying: "Lucas is mine, he's my love." She got hysterical about it. After a while I had to call the police to take her away. What will she do now? I don't know. But I have a right to live too. My husband and kid shouldn't have to suffer this. Florence? Vincent, I can't do this anymore. Either you decide to change, or we call it a day. We can't go on like this. I wanted to see Hélène at the mental hospital. I went there, but they didn't want to let me in. - How did that make you feel? - I felt bad. But I think it's probably much better this way. Confidence seems to be very important to you. Yes, but I think I've lacked it all my life, except in my work, where I felt as if I was pulling the strings. And weren't you? Yes, but it turns out I was just a puppet myself. What I did to the suppliers, my bosses did to me. And when I was no longer useful to them, when they decided I wasn't good value for money, they didn't hesitate to tell me. I bet they laughed about it. How do you feel when you think about that? I have a sense... ..of waste. But I realise that... ..maybe what happened actually saved me. They push you so far that you can't breathe. I see now that what I did was really... an act of survival, it allowed me to... It's strange, people might think it was destructive, but, in fact, it was my only way to survive. I was lucky to survive. - Lucky? - Yes. Some people don't mess it up. But it was necessary. Good. It's time. Are you nuts? Vincent? I thought you were... In a mental hospital? No, they let me go. Maybe they shouldn't have. Guillaume, did you think you'd get away with it? - Take it easy. - Little Guillaume! - Stop! - To think I trusted you! You were like a brother! - I was your best colleague. - It wasn't my decision! Why did you do it? I'm under pressure too! From Schneider and the others! I'll leave you to each other. Here, your company car. It's not parked. See you in court. Sabine. You OK? Astrid. Vincent? I got the wrong target. Although you were in on it. Think of me when Guillaume gives you an ambitious new assistant . If they haven't already fired me. Thanks a lot anyway. Without you and Guillaume, I'd still be here. See you. - Do you like it? - Yes. I'll explain how it works, it's easy. You know I quit my job? Because of your illness? No. It's not a good time, with this crisis. I'll find something. At least you'll have time to visit me. Yes. Dad, why didn't you want Florence to come? I prefer it when it's just us two. That will also have to change, Dad. You'll outlive me. You're a bear. No, I'm old. An old bear. Yes. I just say no, I don't need you, I'm not buying your bullshit. I don't buy it, there are too many of us. They're not alone in the world. I just say no. I'm not buying your shit. I don't ask anybody for anything. I told you to beat it. - This is my home. - No, it's not. We're all sick of this filth. This is my home. - What are you doing? - Hélène? Get a job, like everyone else instead of being a parasite. I'm not bothering anybody. - I can sit where I like. - Stop it, sir. Stop. - Hélène? - Why should I? - She's bugging people here. - She scares my customers. It's OK, I know her. She's not well. Next time I see her, I'm calling the cops. OK, OK. This is your shit, it's all shit. Hélène. What are you doing? Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Are you a doctor or something? - What do you want? - Hélène, it's Vincent. It's me, Vincent. From the hospital. Remember your friends? Karim? Michel? It's Vincent. Nobody touches me. Hélène, do you remember? Look at me. Don't you recognise me? We went to a kennels, you bought a little dog. You called him Pills, remember? It's Vincent. I came to see you at the hospital, but they wouldn't let me see you. You gave me some advice. You told me to change, so I chucked it all in, and now it's all better. I didn't do anything wrong. I know you didn't. Hélène. I couldn't leave her on the street. No, of course. You were right. What about the guests? Should I cancel dinner? No, I'll handle it. I'll go and help Hélène. OK. I've brought sheets and towels. You can touch. Let me introduce you all to Hélène. She's a friend I met last year in the mental hospital. Make some room for her. Let's go and sit down. Sit down. Like you, I didn't think you could make friends in a place like that, but I did. Hélène, I want to thank you, you really helped me. There, you can sleep here. Come on. Hélène, you can't go on like this. You need to get better. I'm going to help you. Look who's come to see you. Do you recognise him? It's Pills. Remember? Goodnight. I'll leave you two alone. Pills. Pills. - Do you think she'll sleep? - Yes. Isn't it a bit dangerous? - What if she loses it? - No, she's not dangerous. I worry about what will happen to her. What can we do? Can't her family look after her? No, her family can't take any more. Why isn't she in care? She was released from hospital with a prescription, she must have stopped taking her pills and then got sick again. Before you know it, no job, no apartment... What are you going to do? We can't leave her on the streets. She needs some time to find her balance. It's not easy to admit that you're ill. Believe me. I know. She needs to get treatment. Will you come to see me? I promise. I won't let you down. I'm a bit scared. Me too. But you need treatment. Will you take good care of him? Pills? Don't worry. He'll be here waiting for you. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
