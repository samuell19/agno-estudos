♪ Oh, we wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring ♪ Maya... I know it's a few days before Christmas and all, and I know that this is a very special time for us. It's the anniversary of our very first date together. Davis, this has been the most wonderful year. Now, I know you know me, and you know I'm the kind of guy who just can't keep a secret, especially when it comes to giving gifts to someone. You're acting like a little kid. I know, but if you'll just forgive me this one time, I would love... for you to marry me. Yes, of course I'll marry you. I love you. Telephone. What? I said, "Telephone." Snap out of it! Oh, gosh! I better go. I don't want to be late. Have fun. Oh, Patrick, I'm really glad you're here. In fact, I'm surprised you're still here. Look, the end of the quarter meeting is today at 4:00, so I need to make sure you get Scoots groomed and looking his best, okay? Unlike the last time I asked you to do that. The dog isthe mascot of our product line. Oh... Patrick! Whoa! You're unbelievable. That isn't the first time I heard that this week. The meeting's at 4:00. I know the meeting's at 4:00. You know what? I don't see what you don't see in me, okay? I mean, I'm a good-looking guy. I'm available most weeknights. And my father owns the company. You also have the attention span of a 13-year-old boy. Oh, yeah? Hey, what time's the meeting? Hey. Hi. This place is really fancy. You were running late so I went ahead and ordered. Great. What am I having? Crab cakes. Oh, my gosh. You remembered. That's what we had on our first date. That's so romantic. Cocktail? - Please. - Good, because... I already ordered you a martini. Oh. Wow. Your food will be ready in just a few minutes. Thanks. - Oh, a double? - It's Christmas. Mm. Look, I'm really looking forward to our trip to Nassau. Me, too. I'm counting the days. Great. I mean, that's my girl. I just want to make sure that... we both understand exactly what this trip is, and... we don't put any extra meaning on it. It just is what it is. Right. What-- What is it? It's a good time. It's you, me, on the beach. Right. It's you and me on the beach. Because I wouldn't want our great time to be ruined by some emotional rollercoaster. We don't want to have planning and the commitment and the rings. It's just too hard, but listen. This really doesn't having anything to do with you. This is just how I'm feeling right now. It's me. It's really about me. It's not about you. Look, Maya, the thing is you're a sweet girl, but lately I've been feeling like-- God, you're here, right? This is you up here, and this is me down there. Oil and water, right? And salt and vinegar. - Fish and chips. - Exactly. And we should just go and have a great time and not think about any of this stuff. I thought you-- I thought you were going to propose to me today. Propose? Me? Today? No. I mean, I might someday. Hug? No, no, don't worry about it. The drinks are on me. Damn right it is. Merry Christmas! I want you to take a look at Patrick's receipts, Max. Just look at 'em. Winslow, can't you see that I am busy, please? Max, you're going to be even more busy trying to explain your son's expenses to the stockholders. Nightclub, nightclub, - Maserati rental. - Yes. $2,000. He is just a kid. Max, he's over 35 years old. After his mother passed away, I let him run wild. Max, he's irresponsible, he's unreliable, he's-- He's my son. He's the sole heir of the Pet Products empire, and I am confident that he will make a wonderful CEO... someday. What about today? What? Max, Scoots' handlers had to cancel due to an accident, so we have no one left to escort the dog across the country to Los Angeles. Why don't you let your future CEO handle it, unless you feel that he can't complete such a simple task. No, I'm not worried at all. Patrick's a perfect choice. You want to bet on it? You know, I find your insinuation an affront to my entire family. - And yes, I accept your bet. - What? You want to put your money where your mouth is? You'll be sorry. Morning, everyone. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh. Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to business. - Winslow. - Christmas, as we all know, is the biggest gift-buying season of the year. It's great for some, but can be crushing for others. Say that again. Pet Products, the king of the luxury pet market, has fallen into a little bit of a slump this past quarter. Scoots' breath mints and shed-free shampoo have not been exactly flying off the shelves. Things could be a lot better. So what do we do? Well, I'll tell you what we do. We make every dog fancier in America fall madly in love with Scoots this holiday season. Clara and Scoots are going across the United States in a goodwill tour ending up in Los Angeles, where Scoots is going to be the Grand Marshal of the Beverly Hills Christmas Day Parade. That's brilliant. I didn't know Scoots could drive. Oh! He can't. That's where Patrick comes in. What? Me? Scoots' handlers are out of commission, and so you are going to drive. I thought we were going to do the father son Christmas thing together this year for once. Son, it's all been settled. You're going to drive, and Clara, who is the head of corporate communications, is gonna handle all the PR. Uh, sir, I know I said I could go, but, uh, my mother's plans have suddenly changed, and she's on her way here for Christmas. She's already in the air. I'll go. You? Yes, me. Dad... I would love to go to Los Angeles and spend Christmas with my folks, and I just-- I can't afford a plane ticket, so... Oh? Why not? Because you don't pay me enough. Well, then that's perfect. It's now 4:10, December 21. You have enough time to drive to Los Angeles, stopping along the way to introduce Scoots to his adoring fans. It's going to be a lot of fun. If Scoots misses that parade, don't bother to come back. Well, Winslow? Bravo, Max. He's not good enough for you, and he never was, and that should fuel you to move forward with your life and find somebody better. At least you'll be home for Christmas. Mama and Papa will cheer you up. And you can't beat Christmas at home with your folks. I know. I just have to survive this whistle stop cross country tour with a shaggy animal... and a small dog. You'll be fine. It might even be fun. Oh. Well, we're gonna leave tonight. Yeah, all right, so we'll see you in a few days. I promise you, you'll get a chance to meet him. Okay, I love you. Bye. So, your mom wants to meet me? Uh, my mom wants to meet Scoots. Oh. Madam, your chariot. Oh, no, no, no. Where's the SUV? SUV, mess-u-vee. This is a classic land shark, Maya. It's got a satellite radio to rock on down the highway. It's got a nice big shower, big beautiful bed. Whoa. Make that two beds. It even has a kitchen to cook. You know, don't confuse me with one of your floozy girlfriends, okay? Excuse me. I would never date a girl that cooked. Or showered. Ouch. If you so much as look at me funny, I'll neuter you, okay? Shh! Don't say that stuff around Scoots. He's very sensitive. ♪ Woke up this morning just a little bit late for work ♪ You know, before we go any further, I'd really like to go over our ground rules for this trip. Ground rules? Okay, Mom. I require unanimity for all major decisions on this trip. - No loud music, no partying. - No fun. That's right. Now can you please just zip it while I finish my list? No burping, no drinking, no profanity. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. No road rage, tailgating, passing or speeding. And like right now you're speeding. Could you just take it down a notch for me? And, uh, yeah, you can sign it right here. Maya, darling, you don't have an impulsive bone in your entire body. You're right, I don't. Now sign it. Come on, here. Thank you. That is your word. Gross. You're really gross. Let's not forget something. My father owns the company that you work for. And you're forgetting something else. I happen to be the junior vice president in charge of non-human relationships. Non-human relations, Patrick. Non-human relations. It means you walk the dog. So? You don't have to agree with her. ♪ Go, go, Santa ♪ ♪ Whoo ♪ Working late again, Crachit? Yes, sir, Mr. Scrooge. I just really wanted to get this out of the way with the holidays coming on. You're not exactly one to knock off early. True, but that's my name on the firm's front door, young man, not yours. Maybe someday. That's what I'd like to chat about. Sir? Well, Eugene and I have been discussing your situation. We really like the way you handle yourself, and with Edward retiring at the end of the year, we'd been thinking about perhaps expanding our partnership once again. - Expanding? - Yes. Now you know our firm has a tradition built on integrity and values. Family values. Our clients trust and expect that the company will run as it has always been run, on these strict core values. I understand completely, sir. That said, we are looking forward to offering you a junior partnership. What was your young lady's name again? Well, um, Maya. Lovely girl. Any matrimonial prospects there? Um, I'm not really sure. Oh. That's too bad. Remember, marriage is the rock that many great foundations spring from. I've seen the way she looks at you when you're together. You could go far, perhaps to the top, with a girl like that in your corner. You know, you're right, sir. You're absolutely right. Of course I am, son. Well, think it over. It's the most important decision of your life. What was I thinking? Hey. Will you help me open these? Oh, yeah, sure. Oh! What? These can't be good. There's some sort of clear gooey substance on top. What are you talking about? It's great. Come on! You don't know what's good. - Ugh! - Yeah. - Mmm! - That is disgusting! Scoots would not complain. Scoots sniffs his own behind. No. What, you're not hungry? No. I ate yesterday, thank you. You know, I'm just trying to be friendly. And if you're gonna get upset every time that I offer you something, this is gonna be a long trip. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you, but I'm fine, thanks. Okay, apology accepted. Now let's play the license plate game. What? The license plate game. When a car passes, the first one to call out which state it's from gets a point. Oh. Come on! You were a kid once, weren't ya? I was a kid. We just didn't travel a lot. We didn't have a lot of money for vacation. I wasn't a rich kid, okay? Well, this should be a real treat for you then. This is a delight. West Virginia. West Virginia. West Virginia. West Virginia. One for Scoots. West Virginia again. It's usually a lot cooler than this. You think we're in West Virginia? Yeah, probably. What's that say? Yes! Yes! Barbecue! Curly's Rib Ranch? Lovely. The only restaurant for miles around, and it has to be in a barnyard. - You'd be right in your element. - You got that right, darlin', because I love me some barbecue. There's not another restaurant for an hour and a half, and I can't hold out that long. Two against one. Okay. Ugh. This is-- See, that's what I'm talkin' about. It's a real barbecue place. - Howdy! - Oh! Hi. Table for two and a half, please. Hmm. Ain't no dogs allowed here. This ain't no mere dog. This is Scoots. You know, the most famous dog in designer pet products. Well, I'll be. - It is Scoots! - Yeah. I use his mango conditioner on my beard. Have any table you want. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Yes. Well, I'll be. Hah! Scoots in my place. There's sawdust on the floor. Check the guns at the door. Really? I mean, come on. Seriously, Maya, it's Christmas. It's the time of year where people put forth just a little extra effort. So can't you just step outside the box 'cause I think you might actually enjoy yourself. I happen to love Christmas, all right? Except your idea of Christmas and mine are very, very different. Oh, really? Really. Y'all decide yet? Got some brand-new specials up on the board. It all looks so good, darlin'. You know what? Can I see your wine list? Wine list? Wine. You know, I'll just take your house cab. We got bourbon, honey. I can bring you a glass of that. It's made locally. You know, forget it. Um, nothing for me. Just get Scoots here a nice meaty rib bone. That'll do it. Something grass-fed. Sauce on the side? It's made with bourbon. No, no, we're fine. He's underage. How 'bout you? It all looks so tempting. This is gonna take a moment, darlin'. All right, sugar. I'll get that rib bone started. Yeah. Take care of the rib bone. Can you keep your eyeballs in your head? Actually, no. Are you jealous? - Are you kidding? - I'm not kidding... because you and our waitress look exactly alike. Do you want me to hurt you? Do you? Do you have any siblings? Any that lived? You're a riot. Because I have you pegged as an only child. Don't try to analyze me, Patrick. Don't waste your time. I'm not trying to analyze you. It's just that you're so... you. You've been handed the job of a lifetime, VP of a major corporation, and you walk around like some sort of slacker teenager. You have a total lack of ambition, Patrick. Hey, my lack of ambition has got me where I am today. That's my point. Don't you want more, huh? Don't you want your dad to respect you? Of course I do. What do you think that this trip is all about? If I don't deliver that dog... on time, what do you think's gonna happen to my trust fund? And then what's gonna happen to my love life? Because we both know women are only interested in me - for my money. - Right, right, and has nothing to do with the girls you're dating, right? You're engaged right? Yeah, any day now. When's the big day? It's, um, it's tentative. Now's just not really the right time for us. And that's him talking, right? That's guy-speak for, "I love ya honey, but I'm not exactly done looking yet." You know, Patrick, I don't think you're any position to discuss my love life. All I know is that you're with a bachelor you can't stand and a dog on a road trip at Christmastime. That's what I know. Oh, look, it's my boyfriend calling. Speak of the devil. Hi! - Davis-- - Please don't hang up. I have nothing to say to you. Well, I have something to say to you. What, "Hug?" Look, I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I just get so wound up and obsessed with my career that I sometimes forget what's really important to me. Yeah, great. Are you done? Because Curly's is about to thrown down some ribs on me. Curly's? What, are you at a barbecue joint? - I don't believe it. - Oh, really? Well, I am not as predictable as you think I am, Davis. Maya, I know you like a book, and you want exactly the same thing that I want, which is another chance. Just because I love you-- no, I'm sorry... loved you, doesn't mean that you can walk all over me. I work too hard hustling doggy breath mints to be treated like a pee-pee pad. Will you just at least tell me where you are? Clara said that you were at some kind of holiday publicity tour with a dog. Yeah, somewhere between Washington and Los Angeles. I don't know. Chainsaw Massacre, West Virginia. You're driving across the country alone. I didn't say I was alone. And I happen to be traveling in the lap of luxury. Maya. Don't mean to interrupt, but you gotta see this. It's awesome. Would you please? Come on. Who was that? Davis, I have to go. I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for. I'm sure it's under a rock somewhere. Wait!

You know what? This makes me very happy for you. Hi, this is Maya. I'm not available to take your call right now, so leave a message, unless this is Davis, in which case you can stop calling me because you are so dead to me. Bye! Curly's Barbecue. West Virginia. West Virginia. Ah, I got you. Curly's Rib Ranch. Oh, Maya, what are you doing to your palette? Ah-choo! You okay? I think Curly's pork gave me the swine flu. That's funny.

Scoots, you know? Scoots, America's favorite dog. Oh, well, how can I be sure that that really is Scoots or not? Well, you can have a sniff. - Mm! He does smell pretty good. - Yes. That's Scoots' bath and body wash. Oh, like a fresh spring day. Darn right. It is kind of girly-like, though. You sure he's a boy? Oh, please, ma'am, you'll hurt his feelings. Sorry.

Don't worry. I'll be home for Christmas. I love you. That was my mom. So is your father still away most Christmases? My father and I haven't spent Christmas together since the year my mom passed. I thought that was gonna be different this year, but it's no big deal. Christmas is really not my thing. Why? I just don't have the same warm, fuzzy memories about it that most people do, that's all. Christmas at my house is crazy. - It's like a circus, really. - Yeah? I love the holiday. Well, it must be fun. If you share with people that you're close to-- I'm sorry that you're away from your boyfriend. Spending it with my family will make up for it. It's no big deal. You're lucky. How about you? Had any serious girlfriends? What? They were all serious. Not one of them had a sense of humor. Why can't you just give me one straight answer? Just once. One time. Okay. There was one in college that was very special to me. How long did it last? What? I mean, a long weekend? Halftime break at a football game? It lasted long enough. She was-- She was different than me. She was classy, good in school, well mannered, organized. Everything that I wasn't. I even tried to change for her. And what happened? Christmas vacation. I met the parents. Didn't measure up. They thought that I was some footloose, playboy-type that had designs on their daughter and nothing more, and they wanted something better for her. And I did, too. We broke up Christmas Eve. Wow. That's a shame. Sorry. No. I was a young, spoiled kid. I'm happy for her. She did the right thing. But that was the time in my life I realized ah, it just doesn't pay, you know? It hurts too much to get close to people. Indiana. Oh, no, you didn't. No, you didn't. - Texas! - Where? You didn't see the cowboy in the ten gallon hat? No. You're a liar. I am not lying, and by the way, Texas is 10 extra points. Uh, yeah, Scoots saw him, too.

Patrick, I'm going 67 miles per hour. Just relax, okay? We'll get there. 67 miles per hour. 2 miles over the speed limit. Oh, you're crazy! You're making fun of me. Do you need me to cut loose? Will that make you feel better? Whatever floats your boat. Just try and get us to LA within 2 weeks time. 83. See, now that's a respectable number. It's really rattlin' now, huh? Just really opening up! Okay, 90 miles an hour. You proved your point. You might want to take it back down now. Oh, yeah? Are you implying that I'm the reckless one here, huh? Are you suddenly feeling like the responsible one? How does that feel, Patrick? Let's just not forget that we have a very high profile passenger in the back probably soiling his crate about now. Whoo! Wow! This feels good. And I might be next. ♪ Nothing's gonna slow me down ♪ Oh, okay, is that a cop? Yeah, that's a cop. Oh, all right. I can handle this. No problem. Maya, when the cop gets up here, just let me do the talking. You know, I am a girl. I know how to get a cop to put his ticket book away. We're so dead. Just let me handle it. No, I got this. Hi. What seems to be the trouble, officer? License, please. Right. - Here you go. - Thank you. Well, y'all are a long way from Washington, D.C. I'll say. Where you headed? Um... we are going to Las Vegas to get married. Yeah. - To him? - Yes. Really? Yeah. This is my little butterball. I love him so much, you know. Yeah. Well, I clocked you going 103 miles per hour. You must be wanting to get married pretty badly. - Just look at him. - No, thank you, ma'am. If he loved you, he'd tell you to slow down a bit out there. I'm really sorry. I'll never speed again. In fact, I have never gotten a ticket in my whole life. I'll tell you what, Daisy Dukes, I'm gonna run this license and see if you're telling the truth. Now, if there is anything on it, and I mean anything at all, I'm gonna have to take ya in so you can partake of our special jailhouse Christmas grits and gravy. Okay? But if it's clean, I'm gonna let ya go. Sound good? Yes, ma'am. Okay, then. All right. We are so dead. Dead! Are you crazy? I know what I'm doing, okay? You're going to jail, unless-- No, no, that's impossible. Nobody has led such a staid, boring, risk-free life that they don't have anything on their driving record. I mean, I had 3 speeding tickets by the time I was 20. That is because you're a reckless road menace, and I am a model citizen. We're so dead. Get out of the car. Now! "I, on the other hand, am a model citizen." Not 100 miles an hour. 103 miles an hour. I don't get it. I have a perfect driving record. I mean, it's as clean as the driven snow. Well, that's the trouble sweetheart. That's just plain impossible. Meaning that this driver's license of yours is probably fake. Okay, I don't like what you're insinuating. And do I look like some sort of criminal to you? I don't want to get into that right now, missy. Great. Ma'am, I know this is difficult, and frankly I wouldn't believe it either unless I was trapped in an RV with her for the past couple of days, but let me tell you something. This woman, she's telling you the truth. It's true. Well, we have got to do a thorough background check on the both of ya, and since it's the holidays, that may take a day or so. - A day? - Or so. Oh, ma'am, I don't think you understand. This is Scoots, America's favorite dog. And if we don't get him into Los Angeles in 24 hours, we'll both be fired. Let me ask you something. Do you want to be responsible for ruining Christmas for all the little children that are waiting to see Scoots at the Christmas Day Parade? Since you put it like that, come here, little fella. Come here, come here to me. There you go. You don't belong in here. - There you go. - What are you doing? Scoots, no! Why, you little traitor. You two, you settle down. I have got work to do, all right? And you can expect your supper around 5 p.m. Excuse me, ma'am, what about my phone-- Phone call. Great. Finally, my father puts a little faith in me. You know, simple task, deliver a dog. Where does Patrick end up? Jail. It's my fault, Patrick. Tried to escape my old boring, predictable life and look what happened. Well, for a minute there, you were pretty cool. I was cool? Yeah. Coolest. Why is this happening? Why couldn't I have just done one thing right? You know, we might still make it. Yeah. Scoots! Good boy! Get the keys. - Good boy. - Get the keys? Maya, you're not suggesting that we break out of jail, are you? This is not a suggestion. Good boy, good boy. Come. Yes! I can't even believe you're thinking this. This isn't cool. They're gonna treat us like Bonnie and Clyde, we better start acting like it. What? You comin'? I wanna go on record to say that I do not approve of this. But I like the way you're thinkin'. We have to keep our eyes peeled for cops. There's probably an all points bulletin out for us right now. Stop worrying, okay? I'm sure by now they know that we are totally innocent. Besides, we just crossed state lines. They can't follow us anyway. Oh, you're good. Oh. Hello? Maya! Why haven't you called? We've been worried sick. Oh, well, let's just say that we've hit a few bumps in the proverbial road. Where are you right now? Somewhere between here and there. Well, Mr. Grossman asked me to check in with you. It's the 23rd, you know? Oh, we are on schedule. Tell him that Scoots is taking pictures all across the country and making friends everywhere he goes. Yeah, we heard about that. You heard about what? About your little jailbreak at Jackson Corner. Oh, right, that. The sheriff was about to give you the key to the city for being such a good citizen, and then they discovered that you left unexpectedly. Well, we'll just have to do that next time. Maya, this doesn't sound like you. Tell me about it. I'm surprising myself. And, uh, how is Patrick treating you? Fine. Maybe... Maybe a little better than fine. Whoa! Are you having a road trip romance? Maya, are you falling for him? Bite your tongue. Okay, you guys be safe. I love you. Love you, too. Bye. Well? We're fine. Well, what else do you think Patrick can come up with to disgrace this company even further? What is this Shakey's Pack Rat? I'm in. You're in? Yeah, I'm in. Besides, I think we could use a few more photos of Scoots rubbing elbows with the locals. All right. All right! You know what your problem is? You need to know that there's more to life than walk-up Brownstones, the perfect relationship, 2.5 kids with room for a pony. - I didn't say it in a bad way. - Hallelujah. There's hope for world peace. Now, if you could just make it to adulthood, then I could die a happy woman. What do you care? Who said I do? Would you like to dance, little lady? Oh, no. No, thank you, partner. I'm trying to quit. Don't break Cowboy Jim's heart. I've got two left feet, okay. Now, let's not forget that we do have a job to do here. We have to get pictures with these people and Scoots, and that's not gonna happen with us sittin' here on our tushes. All right. Oh, well, looks like he's a one-woman man anyway. There's still a few of us left out there. You know, I've been meaning to tell you something since Oklahoma. What's that? Sorry for the way I've been treating you. You know, I've just, I've got some issues going on, and I've been really stressed out. I mean, not that it's an excuse, but I just-- No, you were right. What? You were right. You were absolutely right with what you have been saying about me. I have lived my life like a spoiled teenager. And maybe it is time that I allow myself to care for someone. Do you have your eye on anybody special? Maybe. Well, tell ya what. This round's on me. It's pretty, huh? Hit me, Nita. With pleasure. Thanks. You know, they're playin' our song. Oh, this is definitely not our song. This is a nice little song. What do you say you and me dance? Let's say you and me don't. Why? I'm not good enough for you? Just not the right time, pal. This dance is promised. Is that so? That's what the man said, Harley. Whatever, mister. You have it your way. Pretty boy. Wow. That was very brave. You protected me. Well, I just didn't want you to be embarrassed with your two left feet. Kinda feel like dancing now. Pretty boy. ♪ And true love ♪ ♪ All I want for Christmas is you ♪ ♪ All I want for Christmas ♪ ♪ Is you ♪ ♪ All I want for Christmas is you ♪ Look who it is. Yes, Dad. Hello, Patrick? I've got some big news. That's cool. Well, you know that little news story about Scoots breaking out of jail? Well, it's gone viral. It's huge. It's huge! Great. Now we're wanted in all 50 states. Better than that, you're wanted on theWink Martindale TV Show in Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon. Wink Martindale? Dad, that's fantastic! But tomorrow afternoon? You gotta be kiddin' me. 3:00 sharp. Now, son, this is the best thing that's ever happened to Pet Products, and it's all thanks to you. Well, trust me, Dad, I could not have gotten arrested without Maya's help. 3:00 sharp, not a second late, otherwise they'll bump the segment. Do you think you can do it? I'll make it happen. Okay, I know you will. I have no idea how, but I'll make it happen. - What happened? - Good news. Scoots is booked on The Wink Martindale Show. - What? Oh, that's great. - Yeah. Bad news. We have to be in LA tomorrow by 3 p.m. or else the spot gets bumped. Well, that's a tall order. Better let me drive. Oh, ha ha ha. Very funny. - Uh-oh. - Oh. Where's the RV? I'll tell you where the RV is. It's stolen. The guy from inside the bar? I knew I should have knocked that guy out for calling me a pretty boy. What's his problem? He said it's the day before Christmas Eve, and if we don't figure this out, we're in big, big trouble. I got an idea. Patrick? Patrick! It smells like a barnyard back here. I think it's Scoots. He hasn't had his shampoo in a few days. Hi, this is Maya. I'm not available to take your call right now, so leave a message, unless this is Davis, in which case you can stop calling me 'cause you are-- Aha! I-I... Oh, darn it. It's not even my car, sweetheart. No, it ain't. It's mine.

Yeah, one would say that. I think it's safe to say that it exceeded all expectations. Almost all of them. I gotta get to the TV station. Yeah. You better go. Yep, I better go. Baby! Mom. This is Patrick. Oh, yes, the dog whisperer. Mom, please. Nice to meet you, Patrick. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Taylor. Well, you're just in time for lunch, sweetie, but then you always are. Maya's the most punctual person I know. She's all about details. Oh, you can say that again. You guys, stop, please. Oh, you must stay for lunch, Patrick. I would love to, Mrs. Taylor, but I have to get Scoots to the television station by 3:00 because he's gonna be on The Wink Martindale Show. Oh! He's very busy today. Well, all right. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. So you got my phone number. Don't be afraid to use it. Oh, I won't. But I'm gonna see you at the parade tomorrow. Yeah. You can get me a good seat, right? I'm in good with the Grand Marshal. All right, so I'll see you soon. Okay. - Maya. - Yeah? I've been thinking, and I know that that is a dangerous thing for somebody like me to do, to think, but come on, what do you think about maybe-- Maya, lunch is on the table. Come inside, please. Uh, all right, so I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Fine, 'cause, you know, it wasn't important. Oh, I love, love, love your hair! Please tell me you're using Scoots mango conditioner on it. He is. Oh, I knew it. I actually use the same thing on my own hair. Oh. It shows. So cute. Oh. Hey, Dad! We made it. Congratulations, boy. Sunny California at last, huh? Well, I knew you could do it. I never had any doubts. Yeah, well, everything's great. - Mission accomplished. - Gee, son, that's swell. You know, I just want to tell you how proud I am. You just took the bull by the horns. Dad, I really didn't do anything. Oh, yes, you did. You took Scoots and put him back on the map, literally. Hah! And think of all those new customers you generated. And now with this TV show and the parade tomorrow... Yeah, big business. Your fortune is safe. I bet Scoots is loving every minute of it, huh? You'd think the president's plane just landed, the way they're fussing over him. How's Maya? How's Maya? What, are you grandma now? Maya's fine. I dropped her off at her house, and I'll probably see her tomorrow at the parade. Maybe you will and maybe you won't. I hear that boyfriend of hers is driving all the way out there himself. I think he wants to pop the question. Pop the question? What are you talking about? Well, that's just what Clara told me. But maybe you'll see Maya before he gets there, and if you do, tell her I think that she's a fine young lady and that she'll make somebody a great wife. Merry Christmas, son. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, not this time. You, do you promise to guard that dog with your life until I come back? No problemo. Thank you. And Merry Christmas. Thank you. Patrick, I'm delighted that both you and Scoots could make it into the studio today because I understand you had quite a trip across country. Yes, we did, Wink. Yes, we did. We had a great journey. And Scoots made a lot of new friends. And he's gonna meet even more new friends tomorrow at the Beverly Hills Christmas Day Parade. Isn't that right, Scoots? I'll be there. I always go. By the way, when you were headed out here... Maya, your father is just taking the cookies out of the oven, and they sure smell yummy! No, thanks, Mom. I think I'm just gonna go straight to bed. Yesterday was a very, very long day. I'm just, uh... I'm just not very hungry. Still sad? Yeah. It's... not what you think. - I just, um... - This journey has been fun, but it hasn't been without its potholes. We were down there in Arizona at a place called Shakey's Pack Rat... I really miss him, you know? But that's natural, right? You'll get over it. You're home now. Well, thank you both for being here today. It's delightful to have you here. And we want to invite everybody out there to come down and meet Scoots tomorrow at the Beverly Hills Christmas Day Parade. I will be there, and you be there, too. Be there or be square. Oh, I got it. Patrick. Oh. Maya! Ohh... Maya, will you please just let me in, please? Look, I drove all the way out here from D.C. My parents take Christmas very seriously. I wouldn't laugh if I were you. I had no idea that you lived like this. And you drove all the way out here, why? Because I finally realized that we are perfect together. We are an exact match. We're exactly the same. Driven and determined. Focused and centered. Chocolate and peanut butter. Did you, uh, you know, get into an accident? Did you hit your head or something? Come on, just give me another chance. You are like the CEO of my life, and I cannot run it without you. We should get married, and we should raise our own team of little junior accountants. Maya... Oh. Oh, gosh. Just say those four little words that will make my heart flutter. You make me sick? No. "I love you, Davis." Right. Patrick's father. Winslow. - Hi. - Oh, please come in. Uh, hold that thought. Maya. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, my-- Oh. What's he doing here? I didn't want you to have to see all this. Whoa! This is so cool! Really? Oh, yeah, totally! Of course, of course. You must be the guy who was working with Maya. - The dog walker. - Oh. Right? You were the one who helped the love of my life get across the country, so thank you very much for that. She couldn't have done it without you. You know what? Here. Here, take it. 100 bucks. I mean, buy yourself something nice. Really, thank you very much. Wow, a whole hundred dollars. Thank you so much. Maya, I need to ask you something. Hey, whoa, easy. Just easy, pal. Back off, chief, before I get all kinds of ninja on you. And what's up with the Band-Aid? You drive out here on your face? It's okay, all right? All right, I'll give you two minutes with her, and then I'm kicking you outta here. Give me your hand. What? I'm sorry. Give me your hand, uh, please. That one. I have something I want to ask you. Patrick, are you feeling all right? I feel great. A little angry, but mostly great. After all that we've been through, you can at least answer me one question truthfully, and your answer can be whatever you want it to be, okay? Okay. I don't know how it happened because the odds were long, the road was bumpy, and the bridge was washed out, but... I have fallen in love with you. And it's no baby crush kinda love either. It's real like I've never felt before in my life real. So my question to you is, do you feel the same way about me? No. And if you do, you kinda gotta say it. You can't just stand there. Oh, uh... You're-- You're crazy. Maya, that's an assessment. That's not really an answer. It's an accurate assessment. Well, what does this say? That's sayin' somethin'. Okay, wh-what... what's goin' on here? Because-- Whoa, Patrick. Oh, my God. It's obscene. So this is obviously about his money. Well, I can give you that. Maya, we're perfect together. Focused and organized. Chocolate, peanut butter. I thought you wanted to get married. I do want to get married, Davis. Just... not to you. Sorry, peanut butter. Well, this sucks. Mom? Mr. Grossman? Get the dog. Uh, excuse me. Dad, what are you doing here? Well, I had a hunch something like this might happen, and I wouldn't miss it for the world. Wait. You flew all the way out here on a hunch? Almost. Winslow? All right, Max, you win. One dollar. Okay, Dad, I don't get it. What's going on? I want to spend Christmas with you for once. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I actually made a bet that you'd be kissing her before 9:00. Well, Dad, this time I'm not gonna let you down. Maya, may I?
