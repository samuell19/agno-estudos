- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Well, Mother, what's the news? - I wish I knew, Mr. Barclow. It says here Paliament in special session. Oh, well, we shall know before the morning. Here you are, Mr. Barclow, a flower for your buttonhole. You know, you must look your best to see your lady. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you, sir. - Good night. - Good night. - Hello, Barclow, any news yet? - No, no, nothing. Good evening, Mr. Barclow, you're rather early tonight. Yes, Jenkins, we spoke our little piece quickly and got it over. That's right, sir. With times the way they are, I daresay the public would rather hear a bit of music. Do you suggest I should take up singing? Oh, no, sir. Not a great artist like you, sir. What I meant to say was... have you heard any news, sir? Yes, indeed. Parliament has passed an act making it a crime... ...for stagedoor-keepers to insult honest actors. Here. Better buy a paper and read about it. Thank you, Mr. Barclow. Who's there? Mr. Pig'n'whistle calling, madam. Are you at home to him, Miss Daranyi? Tell him to come in, James. Oh, Alan, you're a fool! Certainly I'm a fool. Every man in love is a fool. But not every fool in love is a man. Strange, every time I make an epigram, this hat breaks down and cries. So do I. But kiss me anyway. One moment. Would you mind moving your corporeal presence? Your mistress with excellent taste, I may add, wants me to kiss her. Now. Are you an English gentleman or an American psycho? Neither. I'm a man in love with a woman. Insanely, idiotically in love. Can I believe an insane person? Two weeks ago you might have doubted my words. I was an actor. Now I'm a stagedoor johnny. And by the way, since this is my last night of freedom, I've decided to give myself a bachelor's supper. However, since you yourself are a bachelor, I've decided to ask you to join me. Good. We'll go to Bayard's? Terrible place. I'm tired of Viennese restaurants. And tired of Viennese women too, I suppose? Oh, no, I think one of them is the loveliest, the most exquisite, the most... - Oh, wait till I find the right words. - I'll wait. I think that to love you... is to love all women. And never to have loved you is never to have loved at all. Thank you. There, I meant every word I said and... ...this fool hat thinks I made another epigram. A fool hat fits a fool head. Extra! Extra! Parliament in night session. - Extra? - No, thank you. We won't think of the possibility, not tonight. No. - Here's a taxi. - Taxi? Did Romeo watch a meter with Juliet? No! Let's find something with wobbly wheels. - That squeak. - Yes, that's it. - What do you think of it? - Well, um... - Are the wheels wobbly? - No, mum. - Do they squeak? - No, mum. Sorry. - Cab, sir? - Do the wheels wobble? - Ma'am? - Do they squeak? Oh, they do if you want them to, ma'am. We'll take you. Now, milady. Careful. Hm, piece of china, I see. Break if you fall. Now, milord, won't you hop in after her ladyship? Oh, come on, faint heart fair lady you know never wins. That's better. Where will Your Highnesses condescend to drive to? - Buckingham Palace, front entrance. - Sensible idea. The ventilation's good and the food's excellent. The gentleman seems in high spirits tonight, miss. Of course I'm in high spirits. I'm going to be married tomorrow. Does it make you homesick? Sometimes, a little. You see, I told you I didn't like the Viennese influence. Eight bars of Viennese music and you're ready to swap... ...the British lion for the Austrian eagle. Not anymore. ( In German ) Where did you learn such good German? Heidelberg. I used to sing that song when I was little. A long ways from Heidelberg. Silly, I don't even know the town you were born in. I'll show you. There. And to think that small dot represents all the happiness in the world. Why, just think. You might never have been born. - Would you have been sorry? - Of course. Then I should never have lived. Where were you born? In here somewhere. A funny little place with a funny name. Chipping Whitney, about here. Oh, far away from you. But the whole world couldn't keep us apart. We were so surely meant for each other. Mein Liebchen. My darling. What is it, Borel, what's the news? England has declared war on Germany. God save our gracious King Long live our noble King. God save the King. Send him victorious, happy and glorious. Long to reign over us, God save the King! Ladies and gentlemen. Three cheers for England! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! Alan. Let's say good night here. I've got to be alone for a little while. There are things I have to think out. After all, I may have to leave England. But Darling, we are not at war with Austria. - Oh, it's a matter of days, hours. - That won't change us. It'll make me an alien, an enemy alien. - It'll change everything. - It'll change nothing! We'll be married just the same. Alan, if I should lose you, I wouldn't want to live. - There'd be nothing left. - We're never going to lose each other. Haven't we as much right to love as others have to kill? It isn't to be, Elsa. I love you more than anything in the world. I love you more than my country. - Don't say that, Alan! - I swear that I do. We'll go away together. We'll leave England. - Go to America. - Yes, yes, only don't leave me. - Don't ever leave me. - I never will. Never. No. What's the matter? Tomorrow, dear. There's something I must tell you and I simply haven't the strength now. Oh, of course you haven't. Things have happened too fast. We'll... we'll breakfast together. I'll call for you when, 10 o'clock? - Earlier. - Oh, all right, I'll call for you at dawn. My sweet. Alan! - I expected you would be here. - I've been here an hour. I'm surprised you should waste such valuable time with your theatrical friends. However dear they may be to you. Your Barclow is not bad-looking in his vacuous British way. You're leaving for Bologne tonight. Ludwig, I can't! If you don't, you'll be thrown into a concentration camp before the week is out. And you're far too valuable for that, Elsa. No, I'm not going. You're waiting in Paris for further instructions. It will be necessary for you to change your appearence to conform with this passport. It's Swiss. You'd better look it over. No, I won't take it, I'm not going. But this is an order. I can't help it. In that case, if we can no longer trust you, the English government might become aware... But I won't do anything against them. I'm marrying Alan in the morning, we're going to America. - You'll leave for Bologne tonight. - No, don't you understand? I'm resigning from the service. Death is the only resignation from the service. But I love him. You can't ask me to leave him now. Don't you know what it is to love with your whole heart, your whole soul? Yes, I know what it is to love, Elsa. But I know what it is to love my country too. Do you think your heart is the only one that'll be broken by this war? I don't know anything about that, I don't care. I only know I love him. Listen... Ludwig. All right, I won't go away with him. I'll stay here in London. I know people here, officers, Parliament members. I'll be of more use here than in Paris. And I'll be near him. If you really love this man, you'll help him do what he knows in his heart he should do. His duty to his country. In the end he'll hate you if you don't. A man will never forgive a woman... for stopping him from doing the one thing in his life he knows he should have done. That moment has come for... ...your friend. What you do now will really prove whether you really love him or not. You see... I do know what it is to love, Elsa. Yes. Give me the passport. You leave at once. - No, I'd have to see him in the morning... - You leave at once. Yes. It would be better not to see him again. Wouldn't it? Elsa, it's dawn. Elsa. Elsa. The point is, Barclow, a man of your talents... ...can be of more service to England in intelligence among the firing line. - I see. A new type of engagement. - In the greatest show on Earth. Of course it's not the ordinary line of duty, you're not obliged, you know. - I didn't join up to do knitting. - Good. Your perfect knowledge of German makes you invaluable. There is one drawback, however. Alan Barclow, the matin? idol, might be recognized. I noticed in going over your record that you have no relatives listed. Suppose it suited our purpose to announce that you had been killed in action. Would there be any objection? - No objection. - Good. After all, England expects every man will do his duty. What can I do for you, young woman? I'm looking for a medal of the souvenir of St. Helena. Oh, those. They are scarce. I know, but only rare things interest me. Is this the medal you are seeking? Yes, May 5th, 1821. I have some other Napoleonic souvenirs back here. - Your number. - Number 24. Very good. Sit down. This is one of the most dangerous members of the French counter-espionage. Memorize his face. Carefully. His name is usually Robert Laporte. And this is Maria Arnaud. She has been responsible for the death of 42 of our operatives. She will be found in Geneva. You will all have to familiarize yourselves with our new postage stamp code. Each of you will be given addresses to which they are to be sent. In Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and so forth. If you have information... that ten regiments of infantry are leaving Lyons for the front, you will send a letter to your friend in Stockholm saying... you had enclosed 10 Guatemalan stamps for her collection. British aircraft will be indicated by Martinican stamps... ...with one stamp for each airplane. Brazilian stamps will mean battleships. Portuguese stamps will mean artillery. Now, for our own protection, it is necessary that we learn enemy national anthems... ...as if we were taught them in childhood. We will sing first the English God Save the King. God save our gracious King Long live our noble King God save the King ( In German ) Thank you, gentlemen. One more word before you go. You have willingly undertaken the most dangerous occupation in the world. If you are caught, then there is no one to help you. Not even your country. She asks everything of you and gives you nothing. You must be cautious but bold. Obedient but daring. You must be temperate both with liquor and love. Remember, every country has its counterspies. Men and women. All these things we ask of you. And in return, you are given only the thrill of adventure. And the thought that perhaps you have served your country. Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you, sir. I'm sending you to the front, Barclow. Right. Incidentally, it wouldn't surprise me at all... ...if Captain Barclow were to stop an enemy shell. What? Oh, I see, yes. Well, I hope you arrange about proper billing. My public, you know. You'll be at the head of our very best casualty list. Oh, thank you. Getting into Germany will be child's play... ...compared with my work of the last few months. It's easy enough to get you into Germany. The hard part is to do it without our government's knowledge. - Must it be so secret? - In this case, yes. We're exchanging 5,000 wounded prisoners with Germany next week. I see. I'm to be one of them. You are Hans Keller. Private in the Saxon Infantry Regiment. Hopelessly disabled. Disabled how? - That's what I haven't thought of. - What about shellshock? Can you do it? I shall need three or four days to get up in the part. There are some pretty definite cases in the hospitals. Good. But remember, this is entirely on our own. Even the officer in charge won't know who you are. Right. # Goodbye, Piccadilly # # Farewell, Leicester Square # # It's a long, long way to Tipperary # # But my heart's right there # - Well, what do you think about it? - Oh, how can I make up my mind... ...with three, all so handsome. By no stretch of imagination could you possibly... ...call these two bold artillery men handsome. They're positively troglodites. You know what a troglodite is? Oh, yes, that's what you call a sphynx. - That's froglodite. My dear, if anyone is entitled to your charming company, it's my own self. I'm going back into lines tomorrow. Oh, my poor friend, you must leave so soon? Oh, don't waste all your sympathy on him. I'm leaving next day too. So am I. - I'm going over in a tank. - Easy, Mack. - What's a tank? Well, it's sort of a... Air raid! Down in the cellar! Train h?pital pour la fronti?re. Voie num?ro 4. How many Germans are being exchanged today? Not so many, about 140. Train h?pital pour la fronti?re. Voie num?ro 4. En voiture! En voiture! You have memorized the salient details? - Yes. - Good. A present for Herr Ludwig, filled with his favorite cigarettes. And this one, a new mixture I would especially like him to try. Complete specifications of the tank. It is such a curious blend. And Herr Ludwig is such a good judge of tobacco. Inspection of cigars, cigarettes and tobaccos. Before entering Switzerland all cigars, cigarettes and tobaccos must be inspected. - Cigarette, monsieur? - Thank you. Smoking is not allowed. No? No, no, give it to me. Please. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. The encasement is of a special steel from 6 to 16 mm in thickness. Tractors provide easy locomotion over the roughest terrain. A steel monster, gentlemen, capable of opening huge gaps in our lines. A steel toy, my dear Ludwig. Ingenious, but only a toy. What do the English call this infernal machine? - A tank. - Indeed? Hm. Now, we shall fill their tanks for them. We shall design a projectile that will crush them like egg shells. However, I shall recommend the young lady. Her bravery and her resourcefullness are an inspiration for every patriot. - They're a little stupid. - Treason, Herr Ludwig. No, no, no. I only fear they underestimate your information. Nevertheless, you should be a proud woman today, Elsa. A happy one. I'm very proud. But not happy? Hasn't your work made you forget? A little? Not even a little. Oh, poor Ludwig. You don't know what love is. I onky know that war is bad, Elsa. I had hoped he wouldn't mean too much. You must have courage. You're new with us, soldier. I'm an exchanged prisoner. My name is Hans Keller. We welcome you here, Hans Keller. Cigarette? Thank you, sister. We have two more regiments of infantry near Pantenburg. I could destroy the whole Russian front in a few hours. Wipe them out! That may be! That may be! Seize those long-range guns back to the Lindberg fields... Hoffer! Hoffer, stop your strategy and come here. Excuse me. Your fear grows steadily worse, it has all the flavor of fermented sawdust. What do you say to that, Herr Hoffer? You should drink more and get used to it. You haven't been in for a week, Captain Schrottle. Heinrich. Heinrich, who is that man? I could swear that he... No, it couldn't be. - He was killed. - He is a sad case. Just returned from England. Shellshock. His name is Hans Keller. It is, of course, Hans Keller, my wife's cousin! Cousin Hans, don't you know me? Karl, Frieda's husband. Yes, of course, cousin Karl. We all thought he'd been killed. But why didn't you let us know you were here? Frieda will be overjoyed! We'd better go to her at once, I tell you... ...before she bites my head off for keeping you. Come along. You'll excuse us, Heinrich. Sure. And to think that Heinrich had to tell me the name of my own cousin. The fault was also mine, I was lost in my own thoughts. Oh, not at all, you've been too much alone. Heinrich just told me how for six nights he has watched you. Six nights at the same table. - And this is the sixth night. - The sixth night. We'd better go to my lodgings. The news given out here is that Paris is in ruins. No, that isn't true, of course. But they have dropped several shells on the city. From a range of apparently 70 miles. Some women and children have been killed. And the gun emplacement hasn't been located? No, no, they've got that well concealed. Now... If this long-range gun is to be silenced, it must be done from this end. Sabotage? It's a choice between killing German soldiers or French women and children. The choice is already made. Now for your own problem. Do they consider you well enough to leave the hospital? Yes. What do I do next? We'll get you a job as porter in a munitions plant here. That'll give you a chance to go over the wastepaper, particularly from the drafting room. I see. - Have we a man there? - That's always possible, isn't it? Right. One more thing. How do you and I communicate? I'll be at Hoffer's Garden every third night. You'll sit in the accustomed spot. And if anything should happen to you? In that case, others will find some way of accepting your information. Last time I was in Germany, I played in Ibsen's Ghosts. In Berlin. They gave us quite an ovation. Do you think you'll get one now? Oh, yes, any morning at daybreak. Exactly. I'm sure there will be no complaints this time. Yes, yes, the new shell will slide swiftly into the barrel. Well, as you can see here the improvements are obvious. Yes. Show me the blueprints on projectile number 2. Easy. Fire! The explosion killed seventeen men. But that's the least of it. It's the thought that sabotage is being commmitted. Information going to the enemy. And you think that the leak is at your munitions plant? I don't want to think so, I can't believe it, but... But that is the opinion of the High Command. Yes, Herr Ludwig. Even the Emperor has vouched his complete disapproval. Of course, Colonel Von Diegel, you've investigated? Thoroughly. We have a most rigid check on the personnel at the works. - Who's in charge of this? - Captain Karl Schrottle. Schrottle. Very trustful in the office, sir. And all personnel, all precautionary methods go through this man? I supervise, of course. It will be better if this meeting is regarded as strictly confidential. Naturally. Not even your staff must know that this investigation is being made. Young woman, every one of my officers would welcome an investigation! I trust them implicitly. No one is to be trusted, and no one accused. I dare say we shall have more than one spy to deal with. Very well then. I shall be ready to lend you assistance at any time. - Remember the situation is grave. - Colonel Von Diegel, my finest operator is assigned to the case. I shall always be grateful to Col. Von Diegel. - If it weren't for him... - You wouldn't have met me. I wouldn't have spent a week persuing a snowmaiden. But Captain, that's unkind. Am I unkind because you're a snowmaiden? - You're unkind to say so. - And you to be so. Perhaps I'm not. May I hope? You surprise me, Captain. I thought you were so wrapped up in munitions, ...that you wouldn't give me a second glance. Now whatever gave you that insane notion? I thought my intentions were fairly obvious. Well, the day you show me to the factory... The most charming inspection tour I've ever guided. You explained the facts about munitions so clearly. Did I really? I looked in only one direction all the while. Your description of the big gun... Projectile? - Was fascinating. You seemed so absorbed. I couldn't quite decide which was more dangerous. You or the shell. Captain! And a good soldier will never fly from danger. As a matter of fact, he would seek danger. He may even be so bold as to invite danger to his rooms. - Would a good soldier go that far? - Even farther. He'd have a little supper in bed. Champagne, 1905 champagne. Yes, he'd really welcome danger. Where is there such a good soldier? You're looking at him, Fr?ulein. And I suppose the champagne is waiting? In a bucket of ice it waits, trembling with hope. I don't believe you've gone to all that trouble. Would you put me to the test? Just to find out whether you are lying. Good. Welcome to my ancestral halls. I rent them. - But you actually have champagne! - Yes, 1905. - A souvenir of the drive. - And sugar! And butter and white... bread. And caviar! - And is this real coffee? - Yes. But it's unbelievable. They're my treasures. I've saved them to throw at your feet. Or rather, to heap upon your head. That is, I will if you'd take your hat off. It's a very serious thing to take your hat off in a gentleman's room. Well, in that case, I shall wear mine also until you take off yours. Oh, that's tact. Now, if you want to be even more tactful, open the champagne. I'm full of tact. Or is it champagne? Oh, music! I hope your wine is as old as these records. Oh, we simply must have this one. We shall drink to the moment when we take our hats off. Do you think I would have come here if I didn't mean to take it off? That was my heart exploding at your words. Wait! Elsa. Elsa. Elsa. Elsa! You'll never take me. Come here. I'm sorry. I liked you. I'd hoped it wasn't true. Hoffer, you must realize your position is hardly comfortable. As a friend of the English spy, Karl Schrottle. I am innocent, sir. Are you going to shoot me? What to you expect? As a friend of Schrottle, and accomplice of his crimes. I know nothing. I am a good patriot! - On the Bible I swear it. - Herr Hoffer. Perhaps you can give us information that will prove your patriotism. Tell me, did Schrottle ever meet anybody in your beer garden? He always sat alone. Except when I was free. You never saw him with anyone? Wait, there was one. - A cousin. - A woman? No, a veteran called Hans Keller. Schrottle saw him for the first time in many years at my beer garden. He's porter at the munitions works. I always thought it strange. I hardly ever saw them together after that first meeting. You see, it was like this. But Fr?ulein, Keller's papers are in perfect order. A bad sign, Colonel, my papers are always in perfect order. Usually they aren't mine. Why, he's a porter, surely he couldn't have a chance to... To pick up scraps of information? I should like to see this man, Colonel. No, no, don't call him. He mustn't suspect. Dry inkwell. Send the porter Hans Keller to my office at once. Come in. There's no ink in that inkwell, my man. What excuse have you to offer? Asking your pardon, Fr?ulein. See that your work is more efficient in the future. - Didn't you want to question him? - No, no... He seems too completely stupid to be our man. - But you... - Don't fear, we shall keep on his trail. Thank you for your help. Alan! I'm sorry, Fr?ulein, you must be mistaken. - Oh. - My name is Hans Keller. Of course, I should have known. Yet, I don't think I could ever mistake Alan Barclow's face. - You've never been in London? - London, no. No. You'll pardon me, I have to meet someone. If I could walk a little way with you. You see, you look so much like a man I knew. - You separated from him? - The war. He doesn't know. I couldn't explain why I had to leave him. I see. You have been wounded, Herr Keller? No. The man I knew who looked so much like you... I thought was dead. I died too when I learned. That's why you gave me such a fright. - I thought for a moment... - That he was alive, eh? Yes. And if he were you, I'd want to remind him of our love. Of the last hours we spent together. Alan! Did you believe I could ever forget you? Did you think you would pass me by like this? Don't you see that now I know you're alive, nothing else matters? Elsa, darling. Oh, it's been so long... ...since that dreadful morning when you were gone. - I've tried to blame you, I've tried... - I know. I had no choice. Nothing matters now. But it does, darling. You're in terrible danger. Karl Schrottle is dead. - Schrottle? - Yes. I was responsible. You mustn't go to Hoffer's, they're waiting for you there. - But I've got to go. - No, no! Elsa, if Schrottle is dead, I must tell the others for their own protection. Dear, even you can't stop me from doing that. I know it. But I can't lose you now. You won't lose me. - Where do you live? - 157 Karlstrasse. 157 Karlstrasse. I'll meet you there later. Be ready to leave as soon as I arrive. Be carefelul. - Why isn't he here? - I don'y know, sir. He always sits at the table next to the bandstand. Where that gentleman is sitting now. - Get him out of there! - Yes, sir, yes, sir. Just a minute. We want that table next to the bandstand for a special guest. Ask the gentleman to sit elsewhere. I beg your pardon, sir. This table is reserved. Perhaps one nearby. What a nuisance. For the leader. I want the band to play Tales of the Vienna Woods. Certainly, sir. The gentleman over there would like you to play Tales of the Vienna Woods. The Vienna Woods for a gentleman. - Where is Fr?ulein Elsa? - She hasn't shown up. That's funny. She was to meet me here. - Where is your man? - He hasn't arrived yet, Herr Ludwig. You can see for yourself. His table is empty. - Well, put us in the next table. - Yes, sir. - Hoffer. - Yes, sir. Who is that man, like someone from the dead? We found him sitting at Keller's table. We had to move him. Alan Barclow! Stop that man, he's a spy! - Who is it? - Alan. Oh, I thought you would never get here. We have little time. Ludwig recognized me. We'd like to see through samples of your wedding announcements. You see, we've just decided. Come. I keep my better cards back here. - Who is this woman? - Now, don't be cross, Salinger. She's going with me, you've got to take my word for her. I'm a fool. If Ludwig could see this. You are Lt. Franz Hoffmann of the 15th Mecklenburg Regiment. Blinded at the front. She is nurse Greta Wagner. She is taking you to the farm of Heinrich Hoffmann, your uncle, for rehabilitation. Once you reach Heinrich's farm at the border, you're safe. He'll take the two of you into Holland. Now, there's the wardrobe. Dress accordingly... ...while I get your passports ready. And we'll take the pictures later. Now boarding, train to St. Moritz, Arnheim, Rotterdam. Departure in three minutes To K?ln, St. Moritz, Arnheim, Rotterdam. Come. Your passports, please. Thank you. Well, they can't have gone far. Check all avenues of escape from the city. Wire the description to all outbound trains. - You suspect Fr?ulein Daranyi? - We'll make sure. Now, they'll probably make for the Holland border. The most feasible spot is here. The Westbound train left Berlin at 9 o'clock. Wire them at the next stop. Man and woman travelling together. Recheck passports of all possible suspects. Come. Sorry, I have to recheck all passports. Oh, of course. All in good order, thank you. Send a telegram to Herr Ludwig at once. We hold them until his men arrive. You stay here. Hm. Franz Hoffmann, a blind soldier and nurse Greta Wagner. They sound rather interesting, Krause. Wire the train we shall meet them at Wallendorf. Have a plane ready at once. Darling, there's only one way out, we've got to separate. - Alan! - Don't you see, they've nothing on you. They've never actually caught us together. I couldn't bear the load again. That'll be standing against the wall side by side. At least this way they'll have no evidence against you. And I shall have a running chance. - But Alan... - We're not giving up yet. There's always Hoffmann's farm. Fools, blunderers, all of you! Who locked that door? Who put that guard out there? Another five minutes and I'd have enough information... ...to hang every British spy in Germany! But, Fr?ulein, Herr Ludwig... Oh, no, no, not Herr Ludwig, some stupid conductor! I must apologize, Elsa for spoiling your plan. It was really my anxiety to meet Mr. Barclow. It has been some time since I saw him last. Conductor, conductor, the baggage car. I can't get in. It's locked and bolted from the inside. He's still on the train. This coffin was inspected before leaving Berlin? It was sealed by the station authorities. Come on, Barclow, or we'll shoot. Fr?ulein, will you make the identification? I'm not sure. Yes, is that the man? Wait for me in the compartment. - Why did you think that body isn't... - I know. We'll discuss that later. Why did you do it, Elsa? Did you expect to deceive me? - No. - It's too late for me to save you. You've helped an enemy spy to escape. - The others know it as well as I do. - It doesn't matter. He is free! Is that enough? For you? Helping him has given some meaning to my life. It'll make it worthwhile even to die... ...If I must. That is inevitable. No one could stop it. But I can save you from the disgrace of a court martial. And a firing squad. Resignation from the service? It's the best way. Elsa! Come away from that door. You have been kind, Herr Ludwig. I shall be less generous. Neither your, nor war, nor death can separate us now. - What's the matter with him? - His back. We can't leave him here. There seems to be a light in that farmhouse. It must be a quarter of a mile away. - We'll have to carry him there. - Are you insane both of you? - They may have stopped that train even now. - Put your arm under his shoulder. Oh, there's no stupidity like English stupidity. Of course you know I shall denounce you to the first person I meet. In which case I shall be forced to shoot that person. How's that for German stupidity? The woman will have a doctor here in half an hour. That will give us just time to make the border if we can get through. Goodbye, Ludwig. Surround the house. You wait here. Get in there quick. Open that door. I'll hold them off. Come in. Herr Ludwig! - Is Vogel with you? - Outside. We have been searching for an hour. What became of the two? Oh, those! I believe you'll find them... ...beside the railway embankment. ...about a mile or two back. Be sure and take Vogel with you. - The man is armed. - And you? Hurry, Krause. When you arrest those two, I shall be completely recovered... Fall in quick! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
