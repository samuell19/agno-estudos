You want to change? Then we go on wets too. Never! Racing is for playboys and dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with nothing in their heads. The name Lauda... belongs with politicians and economists, on the front pages. What if this is all I can do? Then you need my money more than ever, so do as I say and follow me into the family business. Keep your money. Don't invest in me. But when I'm world champion and my name is on the front pages too... you will regret it. Get out and never show your face again! Asshole. We are happy to welcome back to the Ferrari family... our good friend Clay Regazzoni, and to introduce Niki Lauda, from Austria. We can speak German. You're from Vienna, aren't you? How do you know Curd? Who's Curd? Curd JÃ¼rgens, the host. He is, or was, my boyfriend. There is something very attractive about an older man. But when they behave like a frightened child... I must have been mad. Let me do this. Otherwise we'll never get out of here. We're in Italy, after all. Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it, you're impressed! Excuse me, are you Niki Lauda? Do you need a lift? No one will believe Niki Lauda is driving my granny's car. And do you always get what you want? Usually. Do I look like a racing driver now? Leave this jerk alone. In theory it's possible for James Hunt to catch you. Are you worried? Not at all. For him to catch me, he would have to win a lot of races... and pigs would have to fly. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a family matter to attend to. I should warn you. I'm not going to be any good at this. "Bringing flowers" and "holding hands". I'll probably forget your birthday. But if I'm going to do this with anyone, it might as well be you. My God... a poet! What's the matter? Happiness is the enemy. It weakens you. Puts doubts in your mind. Suddenly you have something to lose. When you call happiness an enemy, then it's too late. Then you've already lost. ...an autograph? With the date, please. The date? Why? You never know. Could be your last. The Grand Prix will go ahead. News is reaching us that Niki Lauda was involved in the accident. He is being flown by helicopter to Mannheim hospital with severe burns. It's not the burns to his face that are the danger. It's the burns to his lungs. In the intensive care unit, six doctors and thirty-four nurses are on duty for him. But his condition is far worse than originally feared. He's awake and just spoke. He said, "Tell the priest to fuck off! I'm still alive!" You can go in. James Hunt gains on the absent Niki Lauda. We need to vacuum the lungs. I should warn you. It won't be easy. Do it again. Are you sure? The lungs will already be bruised. Please, stop. I know what you're thinking, but please... If you love me, you won't say a word. That's a bad start for Lauda, he's slow away. A terrible start for the Austrian. It's perhaps too soon for him to be racing again. The scoreboard still shows Hunt in 5th place. Are you okay? Fine. No regrets. Not one.
