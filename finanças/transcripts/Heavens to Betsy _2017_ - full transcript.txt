- Where's the ham? - It's Christmas dinner tonight. Salad first, you know that honey. - Sally. Heavenly Father, we thank You for this food that we are about to eat on this beautiful Christmas Eve. We thank You for our health and the blessings that You have bestowed up on us, as well as the ones that You will in the future. As we know, it is for our good. In Jesus' name, amen. - Lord, I don't know many times I have to ask for this-- - Sally, stop it. - I know You must be really busy with Christmas coming and everything, but I would really like that new bike, the blue one with the squishy seat that I've been praying for all year. Please check Your messages. Amen. - Betsy, shouldn't you be asking Santa for a new bike? - But Santa doesn't answer prayers, Mama. Goodnight. - God can't come to the phone right now. Leave a message. Beep. - Oh, shut up. - The power of prayer should not be underestimated. 16 through 18 declares: the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. Elijah. Elijah, just a man. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain over the land for three and a half years. He prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced their crops. Our God most definitely answers our prayers, listens to our prayers, and moves and responds to our prayers. Our Heavenly Father loves us, and like any father who loves his children, He knows what is best for us, even if we don't. God, He may not always bless you with what you want and pray for, but I promise you this: He will give you what you need. And when you pray, be thankful for what God has blessed you with, and for what God will bless you with. Let us pray. Betsy. - Hello, Pastor John. - How are you today? - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Good, good, good, how's your dad? - Oh, he's fine, still living in Arizona. - He loves the heat. - I know. We can't get him back here. - Oh, boy. Okay, so give it to me. What'd you think of the sermon? I loved it. - Good. - Yeah, you can't always get what you want, but you get get what you need. - Mm hm. - Well, it must be the case here because He hasn't answered any of my prayers, at least none that I can remember. - Are you sure? there's a reason for that. - Probably because He doesn't check His messages. - He gets a lot of them. - I guess so. I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta get home. I got a big day on Tuesday, and I wanna be ready for it. - What happens Tuesday? God is gonna come through. - Wow. - Have a nice day Pastor John. - You too. - Hey, Betsy. - Hey, Mark, hey, Michelle. - Heya, Bets. Good sermon. - Yeah, it was. How are you guys? - We're good. - We owe that all to you. Betsy the matchmaker. You know, you should do some matchmaking for yourself. Doesn't work as well for me. - Well, maybe you can say a prayer and have God help you find the right guy. See ya. I did. Betsy, here you are. - Veronica, what are you doing here? - I knocked on your door, but you weren't home. So, I took a chance. You said that you came here a lot. - What's up? - I'm heading out for an audition in about a half an hour, and really need someone to run these lines with me. Would you? - I, I, I have an important meeting with a publisher on Tuesday, so I really need to prepare. - That's amazing. For one of your books? Which one? - Wishes Gets Her Wish. - That's amazing, I am so happy for you. - Well, nothing's actually happened yet. - I know it will. You're an amazing writer, with an amazing talent, and an amazing cat. Let's get started. - Here? - You're Sebastian, and I'm Winifred. You've just been bitten by a zombie tree. - Zombie trees? In a comedy? - Oh, no, an amazing new concept. The writer's amazing, fresh out of Colombia College. Lay down on the floor. - What? - The floor. You're missing a leg. A white crab apple bit it off. And your left hand has a couple fingers missing. - The floor? - Yeah. I've just come home and found you laying there. There's blood everywhere. - Can't I just do it from here? - Your line is, "It's the white crab apple. "It bit me." - It's the crab apple-- - White! - White. - I told you to stay away from those horrible trees. What will I do without you? How will I be able to defeat the trees? - Wait. The trees are zombies? What? What? Gotcha. - Sebastian, where is the antidote? - It's too late for that now, my love. I gave it to little Elizabeth. She might be able to outsmart the tree. I am but an old man with no furniture. - Future. - Uh, future. - You are such a good man. I hate to see you go. Wow, that was amazing. It's called acting, people. Ronnie Love. Okay, tell the casting director I'm on my way. - Ronnie Love? - Stage name. - How many of these auditions do you go on? - Hundreds. - Do you ever get the part? - It's not the end of the journey, but it's the getting there that counts. - So that's a no. - I hope I get the part. - Uh, where's the audition? - In the city, Burger King on Adams. - My neighbor. She's an actress. Oh. - Or at least she thinks she is. Wishes. Where are you, girl? Wishes? Hello. You gonna take your afternoon nap? A good day for that, for sure. Heavenly Father, please watch over dad, and be with Mrs. Parker from church, who will be undergoing heart surgery later next week. And don't forget about Tuesday. Amen. The dentist will be with Josh in about 15 minutes. Okay, thank you. - Well, hello, Ms. Poscotti. What are you doing here? - I need to see the dentist, it's an emergency. - What kind of emergency? - I lost a tooth, one he was working on. It came loose. - Do you know where you lost it? - Swallowed it. - Ew. Swallowed? - It got mixed in with some french fries. Can you put it back in? - I'm sorry. Ms. Poscotti, I hate to tell you, if it was a tooth and it comes out, there's no way that a dentist can put it back in your mouth. Um ... Wait. You said you have the tooth with you? - It took a while. Came out this morning. Wasn't just gonna flush it down the toilet. This was my best tooth for chewing. Wanna see it? - Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Ms. Poscotti, the dentist can't see you without an appointment. I can schedule you one right now, for next week. Let's see, I have Monday. - Okay. You wanna keep the tooth here until I come back? - No. No. - I bet you're excited. - I am. Oh, uh, don't worry, you got time. - I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you shouldn't get your hopes up too high. - I've been praying. - Before your sister passed away, you said you prayed night and day, at home, at the hospital, for months. And then, when she died ... I'm just sayin'. - I've been writing books for seven years, okay? I'm a good writer. And God has placed Ann Westphal in my life for a reason. - Now who is she, again? - She is the woman who has a connection to Vanguard Publishing, one of the biggest book publishers in the country! - Have you seen any proof? - I just can't believe that God would have brought me this far for nothin'. What? - Proof. - What kind of proof? - Proof that this women is who she says she is and that she actually has this big connection. - I looked her up on the internet, she's got a very good-looking LinkedIn page. - Oh! - And she-- - Oh, that's different. Come on! Everybody has a LinkedIn page. - Okay, she seems to know a lot about books, and publishing, and I have no reason not to believe her. - Have you given her any money? Yes. - For what? Expenses and things. Okay. - You guys doin' okay? - Yeah, thank you. - Okay, just let me know. - Thank you. You better get back. - Oh! Okay. I will see you tomorrow. - Oh, no, I took off work for the meeting. - Oh, that's right. Well, good luck tomorrow. Seriously. May the force be with you. Okay, that's not serious, but thank you. - Bye. - Tomorrow's the big day, Wishes. Big day. Better be. Heavenly Father, I'm a little nervous. But I have faith that You will intervene tomorrow and I will finally get the success that I've been praying for. In Jesus' name, amen. Why? - They like the story, but they felt the writing was childish. - Kids don't know what's childish or what's professional, they just know what they like. And, and, and, and parents that I know that read it to their kids, they love it. - Betsy, of course your friends and family are going to love it. Vanguard has been publishing books since the early '60s. They know the business. - But you said that I'd get money. - Only if they liked it. - What about the money that I gave you? - I did what I could. That's what the money was for. We took a chance, and it didn't pan out. - Miss Westphal, I don't know what you make, but that was a lot of money. - I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but don't be discouraged. Keep writing. Maybe you can get a smaller publishing company to put out one of your future books, and Vanguard will take a second look at you. - You told me that I would get a check for $10,000. I was counting on that money. - I know. I'm sorry. - This is gonna sound corny, and simplistic, but you, you held my dreams in the palm of your hand, and now you act like you don't even care. People warned me that this could be a scam. - A scam, after everything that I've done for you? - What exactly have you done? You know, I, I haven't seen any papers or anything in writing. - You are inexperienced. I don't expect you to know how things work in the professional world of publishing. They didn't like the book. - How many other people have you done this to? Hey! Don't You check Your messages? I believe in You. You know I do. I have, all my life. Ever since I was a little girl, I never lost my faith. After Sally died, then after I lost Mom, I know You were there watching over me. I felt You! What am I doing wrong? Have I been selfish? When I pray, I ask for things for others first, always putting myself second. You know this meant a lot to me. I keep falling deeper and deeper into debt. I could use a new car, better job. Would it be too much to ask for just a little success, here? You know, what did I do that was so bad in this life that You can't answer one, just one of my prayers? - This your coat? - No, that is not my coat. - Cool. God bless you, sister. - God? No. No, no, no! No, no, no, no! This isn't happening. This isn't happening! Wow, Coach. Coach? Where's my phone? Hello, 9-1-1? Yeah, I wanna report a stolen car. My car, it's been stolen. Betsy Simon. I'm outside of St. John's Church. Oh, finally. Oh. - Are you Betsy Simon? - Yes. Oh, it took you long enough. I'm freezing. - Probably should have a coat on. I did, but some homeless woman has it now. It wasn't my coat, anyway. - What? Nevermind. My car, it's been stolen. - What makes you think it's been stolen? - I parked it right here. It was here a little while ago. I had an important meeting downtown. I drove it here, I parked, went inside, came out. It's gone. - Right here where a truck's at? Yes. - And you have no idea whose truck this is? - No, I've never seen this truck before. - 10-4. I just ran the registration. Plate comes back to a Betsy Simon-Bennett. - Who? - Betsy Simon-Bennett. That's you, right? - Yes, but no Bennett. - So this isn't your truck? - I don't think so. - Excuse me? - I mean, the fur coat wasn't mine, either. These clothes, these shoes, this really nice purse. I mean, if this was my truck, I would probably have the keys, wouldn't I, officers? Thank you. - You know, can I see some ID? - ID? - Yeah. Driver's license? - Uh. Might be in here. - Ms. Simon, is it possible your husband, Mr. Bennett, switched vehicles with you? - No, no, he wouldn't do that. I don't think. If I was married, which I'm not. - Ms. Simon, don't call 9-1-1 unless you have a real emergency. - But-- - Not a civil matter. - Hey, we got another call, let's go. - Who are you? - I'm Mario Gonzales. Who are you? - Well, Mr. Gonzales, you're in my apartment. - I am? - Where's my cat? Wishes? Where are you, girl? Sweetie-- - Hey lady. Lady, lady, there's no cat in here. I think you have the wrong apartment. Mario, who is that? It's some crazy lady looking for her cat. - Wishes! A Mexican man is holding my cat hostage. The cops won't believe me. This isn't my truck! I don't even like trucks! These aren't my clothes! Oh! As much as I really like this purse, this isn't my purse! Mrs. Poscotti? It's me, Betsy. Betsy Simon. - Well, hello! - Hi, can I help you? And who are you? - Do you have an appointment? - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Ms. Poscotti, you know who I am, right? - Yes. - Tell her. - You're the cat lady. - The cat lady? No! Betsy Simon. - Right, the cat lady. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, you, lemme guess. You have no idea who I am. And you don't know that Mrs. Poscotti has swallowed and passed a tooth that she has come here to make the dentist put back in her mouth. Am I right? - What tooth? - You know what, I've seen this kinda thing played out too many times in books and movies. I'm just gonna come off like a total crazy person! So I think that it is best that I leave. - You got that right. - Well, I don't know what that was all about, but here's the tooth. - Alright. I'm a writer. If I was a character in one of my own books and this was happening, I'd probably continue to go to places that I know only to find out that they no longer exist. - Oh, back so soon, Mrs. Bennett? - Who? Oh, oh, yes. Yes, I'm back. I've been having this really strange day. I've been out of it all morning. It's like I can't remember people's names. - Well, Mrs. Bennett, I sure hope you haven't forgotten mine. No, no, no. You're ... You're-- It starts with a B. - Gonna need a little bit more help than that. Ends with an N. - Beltron. Oh, no, uh ... Uh, Ben? Benson? - Brian. - Brian. Brian, of course. Ah, Brian. And you're the butler. - Well, only if I've been demoted from being your PA. - PA? - Your personal assistant. - Oh, right. - So, how did everything go? - Good. Where's your coat? - Coat? - Your fur. - Oh, that. Uh, I gave it to charity. - What? - A homeless woman, actually. Oh, Mrs. Bennett. - I live here? Wow. - Mrs. Bennett? - I mean, it's like every time I come into this room, I'm like, wow! I live here! - Yes. - I used to live alone. I mean, before this. It was just me and my cat, Wishes. Now I don't even know where she is. She's where she always is this time of day. - Wishes? - Yes, oh, but don't worry. She will be ready to go by the time you're dressed, and I will have Karen tend to her, immediately. - Karen? - Yes, she's on the phone checking arrangements with the book store. - Book store? Oh, sorry, I don't mean to repeat the last word of every sentence you say. - You may want to hurry. - Hurry? Oh, sorry. - Change? - Is there something wrong with what I'm wearing? - Absolutely not. - So why do I need to change? - It's what you do. - Ah, okay. Uh, should I change in the bedroom? - Well, you can change any place you'd like, but I think the bedroom would be best. - Of course, the bedroom. Which is ... Upstairs. - Yes. Here I go, upstairs. Wow. If this is a dream, I might not wanna wake up. - Are you ready, Mrs. Bennett? - I guess so. Is something wrong? - No, a lovely choice. Brian is getting the car. Traffic shouldn't be too bad. We'll just be fashionably late. - And you are-- - Karen. - Karen. And where are we going? - Your book signing. - Oh. - Are you ready, Wishes? Let's go. Wishes. I missed you. Hi, it's me. I missed you so much, girl. Whoa, you're here. It's you, it's really you. - You forgot Bennett. - Oh, sorry. - Thank you. - Could you make it out to Mary? - Sure. - Mary loves the new book. We have them all, but she likes this one the most. - Thank you. - What gave you the idea for this one? - Well, it wasn't exactly my idea. Thank you. - Be careful, no fingers in the cage. - Hello. - Hi. - Bet you didn't see this coming. - What? - All this, the fame, fame and fortune. - No. - I'll take Wishes up to her room. - I'll check her schedule for the rest of the month and see what's next. - So, at this point in the story, it's only logical that the main character ends up mean. Whoa. I mean, I just showered, so that can't be it. Oh, sorry, Sugar Pops, but I'm not going to be able to make dinner, tonight. I know, again, but I mean I've got a meeting with the other investors, and I mean, we've gotta lock down the director now that we have our lead actress, so. - Bennett. Darren Bennett. You're Darren Bennett. And if I'm Mrs. Bennett, then we got married. When did that happen? How did that happen? No. Oh. Alright, it's time to wake up. It is time to wake up. I need to wake up. - Betsy? What's wrong? - Oh! I'm having a nightmare! Oh, can't be happening. This is, this isn't happening! - Betsy. Sweetheart, what are you doing? - This is not happening. Come on, come on. - Betsy? Betsy, honey. You are awake. Ow! What was that for? - Did you feel that? Yes! - Oh! Me too! - Brian! - Yes, sir? - I cannot be late for this meeting. Get her something to calm her down. - Yes, sir. Are you alright? - Yes. Yes. I mean, no! Do you know who that is? That's the boy that I had a crush on in the eighth grade. He always called me Sugar Pops. - Yes. You've told me this many times. - But I didn't marry him! I mean, I wanted to back then, but I was only a girl. Last I heard about him, it was at the eighth grade class reunion and he'd been married a few times. He lived in New York. Had some bad investments, they went wrong, lost a lot of money, and then he went bankrupt. Wait, did he just say he went to an investor's meeting? - Mrs. Bennett-- - Ah, don't call me that, okay? It's Betsy. It is Betsy. Just Betsy. - Uh, it has obviously been a very long day. I'll draw a hot bath for you, and I'll have the chef make one of your favorite salads for dinner. - Do we have kids? - No. - Do Darren and I sleep together? - Not that I'm aware of, nor should I be. - But we don't sleep together? - You and Mr. Bennett have separate bedrooms. - Not that I'm complaining. Why? - Well, because of your sleeping disorder. - Which is? - You snore. - Okay, so this isn't a dream. What do I do now? What a time to get writer's block. Pastor John? Pastor John? - Good morning. - Oh! - Can I help you. Pastor John! You're still here! - Oh, well, normally, I'm here as early as seven, but the traffic today is-- - Oh, no, no, no, I meant you. You, you're still here. - Okay, I'm afraid I don't understand. - Odds are that you won't, but I need to talk to someone who will at least give me the benefit of the doubt. - That's great, and you are-- - I'm Betsy, Betsy Simon. - Betsy Simon. Betsy Simon. - Yeah. - Yeah, no. - Oh, great. I was hopin' if I came back here, I could get some answers. - Well, what kind of answers? - We better sit down. - Okay, um ... Okay, okay. - Something happened yesterday. Okay, I came in here in the morning to pray. Well, actually, it wasn't your standard format of prayer. I was very angry with God, so I came here to let Him know, and afterwards, when I walked out, that's when everything changed. What do you mean? You're not gonna believe me, because I'm not sure I believe it myself. - Okay, well, believe what? - My life, my entire life as I once knew it has completely changed. - Many people have come to God, and they have left here to lead totally different lives. - Yeah, yes, I know, but that's not what I mean. Everything around me has changed. Everything but me. I no longer live in the tiny apartment that I had, where I was alone and single. I no longer work at the job that I had, where I was grossly underpaid. And now, I'm married. I live in a mansion. And all of this because apparently the books I've written have done really well and have made me wealthy. - And this is bad? - Yes. Well, no, not financially, but it's not my real life. - Okay, uh, let's go back. So, you say you're a writer. - Yes, yeah. I write children's books that feature my cat, Wishes. She's still here in this life, or at least it looks a lot like her. - Wait a minute, Wishes the cat? - Yeah. - My sister's children love those books. You wrote them? - I think so. I mean, I think they're the same books. - Well, then that would make you Betsy Simon-Bennett, well, yeah, yes, I've heard of you, of course. - No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. Before I walked out of this church, yesterday, I was nobody. I was Betsy Simon, I wasn't a famous book author. I mean, this is something I've been praying for, for a long time, but oof. - If what you say is true, it would appear that God has answered your prayers. - Wait a minute. Oh, when I first heard about LASIK surgery, I prayed for 20/20 vision, because I couldn't afford it. Oh, the truck! Oh, a few years ago, I saw that movie, with the pastor, and his car breaks down. He prays, God gives him a new truck. I needed a new car, so as a joke, I prayed for one. I didn't actually think ... Oh, and Darren Bennett. Oh, in the eighth grade, I prayed that someday I would marry him. Oh. He answered them all. All of them? - Okay, well, I don't think God works like-- - I didn't mean all of them! God, my dad always said You had a funny sense of humor, but this is not funny. - Okay, okay, okay. Mrs. Bennett-- - It's Betsy! Oh. - Mm hm, mm hm. Betsy, Betsy, okie doke. Now, have you been under any extra pressure? - What do you call this! What other, oh, what other prayers did He answer? Listen, Pastor John, you gotta talk to Him. You gotta ask Him to put it all back. You could do that, can't you? - Betsy, I'm not sure that I can help you. Even if, even if what you're saying is true, I think the only one that could help you would be God, Himself. Um, and I am so sorry, uh, I have a meeting with a couple who are getting married. They'll be here any time, so would you like me to pray with you. - No, no, no, no prayers, no thanks, not now. Not until I figure this out. Thanks. I think. - Yeah. Okay. Mm. - Mark. - Sorry, do I know you? - Do you? Oh, probably not. Are you here to see Pastor John? He said he was meeting with somebody named Mark. - Yes, he's marrying my brother and his fiancee. - Oh, good. Good for them. - Thank you. - Are you here alone? - Yes. - Do you know anybody named Michelle? - Oh, I know a few Michelles. - Michelle Adderley. - No. Well, I've gotta go. - Ah, oh, yes. Thanks for your help. No problem. - Oh, Mark, um, your wife couldn't make it? - I'm not married. - Betsy! - Yes! - Betsy Simon. - Yes! - Betsy Simon-Bennett. - No! - Wow, nice to meet you. Are you doing a book signing around here? I heard you were at the book store or the library recently. - Yes, I was. Well, you look lost. - Good call. - Can I help you? - Yes! I didn't want to disturb you during lunch. I wasn't even sure you'd be here, to be honest. - Well, how's that? - You've probably got what, another 20 minutes before you have to go back? Do you mind if we talk? - Sure. What, like, did I win something? If so, I gotta be honest. I haven't read any of your books, although I love the commercials with the cat. - Commercials? Wishes does commercials? Uh, don't do that. You didn't win anything. This is gonna sound really strange, but what do you know about me? - Uh, not much more than what I read about you on the internet or what I've seen on television. - That's okay, that's okay, anything. - Well, you write children's books. Uh, your cat, Wishes, is it, is just as popular as that Grumpy Cat, if not more. Um ... Oh, I saw on that show, Windy City Live, once, where you are originally from Southern Illinois. Um ... You're an advocate for something. - Advocate? For what? - I can't remember, something to do with religion, maybe? Oh, and you are married to an independent film maker, and you live somewhere in the north suburbs, I think. - He's a film maker? - Yeah, although I don't think he's ever done anything that anyone would know. Oh, with all due respect. - That's okay, that's okay. - I think that's all I can remember. - Thanks, that helps. - Oh, wait, wait! Should I know more? - Yeah, but in another life. Thanks, Randi. - Wait, how did you know my nickname? - Mrs. Bennett, did you forget your appointment this morning? - No, I canceled. - You canceled? Mr. Turko must not have been notified. How do you want me to respond? - Uh, just tell him I haven't been myself, lately. Literally. Look, I'm not feeling that well. I'd kinda just like to be alone. - Are you okay? - Whose bike is that? - It's yours. You've had it ever since you were a little girl. - But I would really like that new bike, the blue one with the squishy seat. - Why am I keeping it? - You said that you wanted to give it to your daughter. - My daughter? If you were ever to have one. I'm sorry, Mrs. ... Betsy. But why is everything so unclear? - It's not. Not anymore. So ... If He answered them all ... Then it only makes sense ... He's gotta put things back. Not now! I'm sorry to bother you, but your sister is here. - Who? Sally? - Hi. - You're freaking me out. - Sorry. - All you've been doing is staring at me. Did you, like, forget I was coming? - I'm sorry, it's just ever since you died ... Died, dyed your hair, you just look so different. - Well. - Hello, Darren. - Am I interrupting something? - I was about to tell my sister how grateful I was. - Grateful? That she was willing to talk. - Are you feeling better today, sweetie? - Ah, yes, better. - What happened? - Oh, your sister went a little bye-bye in the head, yesterday. - It was just stress. - Oh, is that what it was? I thought it might have been because of one of the reviews of your new book. - Reviews? What reviews? Hey, that's the spirit. - Wasn't for those books, you wouldn't be able to produce those masterpieces of cinema. I couldn't live without my Sugar Pops, and she couldn't live without her Darren. I'm irreplaceable. - It worked on Bewitched. - You know, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to meet my leading actress here, today, I'd-- Oh, you know what? I'll get that. - Sugar Pops. - You're nothing but a box of sugar-coated cereal. - Before I run, I just wanted to introduce you two to the star of my next film, Ronnie Love. My wife, Betsy. - You have an amazing kitty. - And my irreplaceable sister-in-law, Sally. - You have an amazing sister. Right, well, now that's done, we're off to rehearse. - And what's this movie about? - Oh, it's an amazing script, with amazing characters. Darren's such an amazing writer. - What's it called? - Zombie Tree. Are you okay? - Wrong pipe, wrong pipe. - Okay, time to go. Um, well, did you take a cab here? - Just like you asked. - Excellent, we take my car to the theater. - Why did she take a cab? - Oh, well, you know, that's 'cause Ronnie lives in a pretty nasty neighborhood. But that's all about to change, right? Right. Don't wait up, Sugar Pops. - Have you ever seen any of his movies? - Just the last one with the serial killer nun. - What was that one called? - Bad Habit. You'd think someone would've told him by now. - Told him what? - They suck. Is something wrong? - Everything. Except for you. - Uh, we never really talked. - How 'bout tomorrow? - Mm, I gotta work tomorrow. - Oh. Where? - Tony's Cafe. - Manager? Waitress. At least I got money coming in. You could use a new coat. - What? - Here. - Are you out of your mind? This is one of your favorite coats. - Not anymore, now it's yours. You need money? Brian! Oh, there you are. - Yes Mrs., uh, Betsy? - Do I have a checkbook? - Yes. - Can you get it and fill it out so all I have to do is sign it, and make it out to Sally, Sally-- - What? Simon. - Really? Oh, okay. Um, for-- - A thousand? - Make it 10. What? I have that much, don't I? Drop in the bucket, right? - Yes, I would say so. - Alright, then. - Darren's going to kill you. - Oh, it's my coat. No. Why are you doing this? - Because you're my sister. And I've missed you terribly. - I don't get it. - Okay, how 'bout this? I love you, and I don't want anything bad to ever happen to you, and that includes catching a cold. - I ... Love you, too. Thanks. You forgot Bennett. Ah, right. - Thank you, Betsy. You really are the best sister anyone could ever have. - Hug! Toss this in the trash, Brian. - Well, will you be giving away any more coats, today, Mrs. ... Betsy? - You never know what I might be giving away, Brian. That is quite a predicament. - Yeah, it is. - So if you ask God to put things back, and He does, then you lose Sally again. Is she different than what you remember of her? Uh, from before, I mean. - How would I know? You know, she died when she was 18. She's older, now. You know, she's still the same funny, loving sister that she's always been. And she's always a bit sharper than I was, and still lets me know it, but that's just her. - You really should pray and ask God for guidance. If He is responsible for this happening, there's a reason. - So God answered all of my prayers, just so Sally could be alive? - Even unselfish prayers made for a life to be spared or saved go unanswered. There's a reason, as painful as that may be to us. It might be best that we don't even know why, but if what you say and believe is true, then you have the rarest of rare opportunities to see what those reasons were. - So you finally believe me? - No. - So, I guess this is the part of the story where the main character resolves herself into the situation and makes the best of things. Oh, hey, Mark, it's me, Betsy, from the other day. You were here for your brother's wedding, or-- - Yes, that's right. - Yeah, yeah, I was just in, talking with Pastor John. What are you doing here? - I was just dropping off stuff for the wedding. - Oh, here, they're getting married here. - It's a pretty awesome church. - Yeah, yeah it is. I always thought that some day I'd get married here. Hey, if you're not busy right now, maybe we could go grab a cup of coffee, to get to know each other a little better, you know, 'cause we go to the same church and everything. - You go to church here? - Yeah, of course. I've been going to church here for years, just like you, you know that. No, you don't. You don't know know that. Scratch that. I am thinking of going to church here. Maybe you can tell me more about it. - Well, I do have an hour and a half before my next appointment. - Oh, great, that's great. I know a coffee shop, it's just around the corner. - Are we going? - Yes, yes. It's a beautiful day outside. The trees, it's fall, it's my favorite time of the season, the smell, it's just the best. - So, what brought you to the church? - Well, uh, I've been going through some serious life-changing times, lately, and I needed some help sorting it all out. - I'm sorry to hear that. Have you prayed for guidance? Well,, ironically, that's where the life-changing came in. - So, God answered your prayers. - Yep. - That's wonderful. - Nope. - Oh. I'm sorry. - It's complicated, very complicated. Let's just say I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, right now, and it's forcing me to make the best of a rather difficult situation. - Oh. - If you never got married ... Is there someone special? - No, not right now. - Mark. If I could tell you everything, which I would so much like to do without you thinking I was completely out of my mind-- Then go for it. - Truth is, even though we just met, you've been in my heart for a long, long time, as if we've know each other in another life. In that life, you were married, and I was the one who introduced you to your wife. Which, even though I was happy for you and her, I regretted ever doing it, but I accepted it. And even though I wanted us to be together, I never prayed for it, not once. And being that you probably won't believe me, you'll never know the irony of that right now. I just thought if it was meant to be, that God would have made it happen. So, here we are, you looking at me like I'm a complete nut case, and me hoping that maybe ... Maybe we're both here for a reason. Maybe we could have dinner and you could recommend a good psychiatrist. - I'm sorry. - Oh, wait, no, I'm not married. I mean, I am in this life, but I'm not in the other one. - Enjoy the rest of your day. - Mark! - The Bible? Really? - What? - There's never been a Bible in this house. What, you went out and bought one? - Sit. - I can't, and I gotta go, I got a thing. - Sit down. Why do we sleep in separate bedrooms? - You know why. - Snoring? That's it? - What else? - When was the last time we? Well, I mean, it's um,, it's been a while. Wait, is that what this is about? - No. I just wanna know if ... you love me. - Well, of course I do, Sugar Pops. You know how time-consuming pre-production is. Look, after the film is done, we'll ... We'll take a trip. Spain. We haven't been there, yet. Alright, you know what? I gotta go. - Darren. - Yeah? - You were so cute in eighth grade. - Well, thanks, Sugar Pops. - What happened? - Thanks. - Mrs. Betsy? Mrs. Hopper is here to see you. - Who? - Bye. - Caroline Hopper, from the organization. - What organization? - Shall I send her in? - Sure. Oh, Betsy. Your great room is outstanding. Did you decorate it yourself, or did you have it done? - Definitely wasn't me. - For all the time we've known each other, I can't believe this is the first time I'm seeing the inside of your beautiful home. I trust you're prepared for tomorrow? Doing some research? - Oh, you mean the Bible? Yes, doing some research. - Good, good. This'll have to be brief. I'm meeting with Charles Bellamy within the hour. We're planning that fundraiser for the following week. I need not remind you how important tomorrow is. - Book signing? Oh, wouldn't that be funny? you and Wishes on stage in front of hundreds of college students and professors. Maybe next time. - I'm sorry, uh, Caroline, if this isn't a book signing, excuse me, I've just been out of it a little bit, what is it? - Oh. Oh, oh, I know you're so comfortable with the book signings and this is a bigger crowd than you're used to,, but I'm sure you'll do just fine. Now, I need you to have a look at this. Take any notes, add anything from the Bible, or whatever. And I'll see you at the university tomorrow. Now, you rest up. Oh, I absolutely adore this room. - NOGOD. National Organization for Getting Out Deities? Caroline, who wrote this? - Why you did. What's wrong? Well, I tweaked it a bit, as we agreed I would, mm hm. - I can't say this. - Oh, no time to debate this now. - Maybe you should. - It's your story, not mine. Let's go. Thank you, thank you, everyone. Our guest speaker today is a dear friend of mine who I've known for many years. She is a strong, independent woman who recently came out about her beliefs and views on atheism. She is a celebrated author. Her children's books have sold millions of copies world-wide. She is currently working on her newest book. It's called Wishes Learns the Truth. It's a book that parents can use to introduce their children to atheism. Many of you know her as the cat lady. Ladies and gentlemen, Betsy Simon-Bennett. - Cat's got my tongue. My whole life, I was told there was something greater than me. When I started writing books, I was told I was good at it, so I continued to do it, praying to God that He would make me successful as a writer. And when that finally happened, I realized for the first time in my life, that it wasn't God who gave me that success. All those years of my life, wasted on believing that a divine being would be able to make something happen when I was the only one who could. It was then that I realized there is no God. I'm sorry. I can't read this. With all due respect, I know that most, if not all of you are here today because you believe that there is no God. A little over a week ago, I was Betsy Simon, and I was happy. Yeah. I was. Just like all of us, I wanted to make money doing what I loved to do, writing books. And I met a woman who told me that she could help me do that. And I believed her, but it didn't happen. It was all a lie. I was hurt, upset, angry, and I blamed God for not answering my prayers for it to happen. But on the very same day that the book deal didn't happen, something else did. I got all that I ever prayed for. But nobody knows who I am, not even me. Until now. So here I am, an advocate for non-believers, in an auditorium filled with people who believe that God doesn't exist. Right. And what's truly ironic about that is if He didn't exist, I wouldn't be standing here in front of you. I can't be a part of this organization, or whatever it is! I'm sorry. But I don't under-- - I can't! Not anymore. - I hope you know what you're doing, because I don't, I have no idea, no idea. - Is everything okay? - No, Brian, it's not. Brian, when we get home, I want you to bring me all of the financial records from the time of my first book deal. Can you do that? - I'll need your approval, and your signature, depending on what it is. - Whatever you need, but I don't want Darren knowing about this. - Okay. - Wow, I'm really not used to all this hugging. Why are we meeting here? - I didn't want Darren walking in on us. I need to know something. - Hm? - Uh ... Do Darren and I have a prenup agreement? - You do, but you know that. - We sleep in separate bedrooms, because I snore. You don't really believe that? - Did I ever? - What's going on? You know all these things. I don't know anything about this new one, that Bunny Love, whatever. - Veronica? The actress? Pretty obvious. - You mean, the two of them? - Wow, there is just way too much revelation going on here. You know what he's done in the past, with his other leading ladies, most of them ending up with nothing more than a cameo afterwards. Is that why you're asking about the prenup? - And he knows that you know all of this. Is that why he doesn't like you? - That and the other thing. - Something to do with you? You used to work for us, for Wishes Incorporated. I was looking into the business records and I just saw that you had worked for us until the end of last year, and then you quit. Did it have something to do with Darren? - If you really wanna know, I didn't like what he was doing, so I told him. Didn't he tell you? - Have you been unfaithful to me? - Unfaithful? In my line of work, I meet a lot of women. You know that. It is not my fault that you don't make the same effort. What happened to the Italian guy? - Wait, what? Frederico, was it? You were seeing him for like a year. - I was seeing a guy named Frederico? You said you like Italian. So, you're seeing other women, and I'm seeing other men. - You were the one that said, it's the 21st century, we can do anything we want. - Not in the eyes of God! - God? Did you really just say that? - Yes. - Look. I don't know what happened that day at the university, but Caroline and her husband are pretty upset. - I'm sure they are. - If you don't want to give them our money, then-- - Uh, it's mostly my money. - Alright. What's going on here? - I talked with an outside accountant. Outside. What, what, what's wrong with Jeff? - He told me about the deficit, close to half a million dollars. - So? - I think you took it. Me? - To finance one of your films or pay back investors. - Of course that's what she told you. Why else do you think she came over here the other day? - Who? - Sally! I don't care what she said. We caught her, we're taking her to court, and that's it. - Sally? You think Sally took the money. Here you go again. You know this. She's a criminal, Betsy. You cannot let her get away with this, not this time. - This time? Hey, how are you? - You goin' out? - Uh, yeah. - Not bad for a waitress. - What did Spielberg have to say? Where's the money, Sally? - Gone. Half a million dollars? Gone? Long story. What happened to you? - What do you mean, what happened to me? Didn't we already have this conversation? We never had this conversation, because I was never lied to by my own sister. How would you know? - Half a million dollars! Sally, you, you don't do that to family. - Like, now, you care, about family? Like when you made your first million after your second book? Did you give any of that money to anyone in your family? No, you didn't. Sure, when mom died, you paid for the funeral and burial. You had to, they didn't have enough insurance. But then, when dad got sick, and lost his job, and asked you for help, you flat out turned him down. Why did you did that? Nobody knew, still don't. And where is he now? In Arizona, in a retirement home, that you put him in. Even though you pay the bills, you never, ever call him. How many phones do you own? And even though he'll never tell you to your face, he hates you for it! - And you have a better relationship with him? - No thanks to you! You love that cat more than you love family. You and your books, you're so busy being a celebrity, you can't even see what it did to you or your family. - You're right. More than you'll ever know. But that's where you being right begins and ends. Whatever the reason, that is no justification for what you did. You're a criminal. There was a time when I lost you, and after you were gone, I always imagined what you might have become. But it wasn't this. - Sister, you've lost it. At least I know what I did. I know you'll never forgive me for it, but I also know what you guys are are going to do, so just do it! - I'm sorry things didn't turn out the way you thought they would. - Did you know about NOGOD? - I did. - Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know, maybe I was trying to see if you were telling the truth. - So you do believe me? - Atheists base everything on the material world, what they can see, what they can touch. Through faith, believers see another dimension beyond what they can see, beyond what they can touch, that is felt here, in the heart. - So that's a yes? - It is. - I'm sure a lot of people are gonna see that video and what I said. - It's all over the internet. You saw it. - Yeah. It was even on the morning news. - So that's really gonna mess up this life. - Maybe. - So where do I go from here? You keep your faith, and you continue to pray. - Oh, He didn't answer my last prayer. Maybe He did. - What? - Maybe He said no. No, I can't tell you how to live the rest of this life, Betsy, but what works for me is to dream big, work hard, and let God do what He does. And trust that He knows what He's doing. - Thank you. You don't know me, do you? Heavenly Father ... If this was a lesson to be learned, I get it. If You gave me everything I wanted, I would become selfish and self-sufficient, and turn my back on You. I was treating You more like Santa Claus, than I was Lord of the Universe, and my Savior. Prayer is more about loving You than it is getting things from You. It's more about what You want from me, and what You wanna do with my life. We are called here to be like Jesus, selfless, putting You first. Not my will, but Your will be done. In Jesus' name, amen. Again, God answered my prayer, and I returned to the life I was supposed to live. I probably won't tell anyone what happened. Not that they'd believe me, except for maybe Pastor John. Like Ann Westphal suggested, I will continue to write. My next book will be fiction to those who read it, but to me, it really happened. - Let us pray. The title?
