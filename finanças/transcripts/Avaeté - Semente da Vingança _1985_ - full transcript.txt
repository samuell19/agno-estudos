AVAETÉ . AVAETÉ THE SEED OF REVENGE The best cut is always for the cook. Try? Ok, then. Hunger knows no taste. There are pacas in the area. (game rodent) But poaia plants? (ipecac regurgitative plant) Not a chance! Did you find what you wanted? Or waste time. Stop yammering! We have work to do tomorrow so shut up. ~(Tells of the giant Eagle.) Drop the kits there. Go get the one over there. I've never heard that to search for plants in the bush you need machine guns. This is also not the right area for poaia. There are cards on the table. If you're not gonna play I'll put your head on the table tomorrow. You're the fucking house cook and a drunkard. You've never seen so much money as you'll earn here. I brought you in. Don't fuck with me. Keep them loaded. You're right. We're not here to pick poaia. Shit! These weapons are weapons of war. Yeah! As soon as I can, I'll get out of here. You know the country well. -Are you coming with me? - You're out of your mind. I'm not leaving this white hair without my money. ~ Its sweet. Idiot! I spent 20 years at sea. It's not a river that's going to scare me. You have 3 seconds to make up your mind. You're crazy to stay here. One... Two. The Indians have centered around the sugar in the village. Hurry! Let loose the loads now! We are going to slaughter Indians. Have you ever killed Indians? Huh? It's nice, you'll see. The bullet pierces better the smooth skin of the savages. But killing white people, do you know, asshole? You're scared, aren't you? Are you scared? You can always turn yourself in. A word to the Marabá police and you end up in jail, you bastard. There is the one who commands, and the one who obeys. And you, you're going to do anything I want. I would have preferred being on the plane. Yeah. There's nothing to do here. The witnesses are all in hell. Isn't that right, Ramiro? You should be more excited. No civilized man has trod this ground. We are the conquerors. And you're just a coward! Sinfrônio, Gringo, go after them! Shit! Let go of me. Let loose! Let loose! Let go of me! Let loose you filthy bastard. It's your turn, my friend. Take this! Right now! Shoot! Shoot him! Shoot! Shoot or I'll kill you! I mean it! He's running you idiot. Shoot! He's going to get away! Want to? No thanks. The problem is the whore might survive. So how do you want to do this? What a bunch of losers. You guys think you are a pack of studs, huh? How do you figure that? You let that motherfucker escape. If he talks, he's dead. You too, got it? Once in the city you'll have your money. Then we'll split up and you forget everything, understand? In the city? Nothing doing. You promised to pay us here. And you will pay us here. I'm going straight home, and with this money. What are you doing? You're crazy! Stop it, kid! Stop it! It's over. Stop it, you understand? You're not big. But you're still damned heavy, kid. Don't fall into the pot. If you piss me off, I'm pissing in the beans. - You won't do it... - We'll see about that. ...Oh, piss on the drunkard. One of these days... I'll really piss.

And the little Indian, he's not talking? It's been a hell of a long time that you've been here, and I never have heard a word from him. That's because he has nothing to say. If you don't want to talk, never mind! Too bad for you. It's horrible, what happened. But it's been more than two years, damn it! Ava. I'm the only person that you have in the world. If you don't want to talk to me, to me! who are you going to talk to? Who are you going to talk to, Ava? Why don't you damn well leave, then? I'll find another kitchen helper. The more time passes, the more my boy moves away from me. I've had enough of this jungle. -How're you doing, boss.? -I'm doing fine. And the timber, how does it look? -As you ordered. -Good. -And how are you?- All is good, thanks. Hello, Tião. Is everything all right? The wood is ready. Let's go, cabin boy. The ship is sinking, come on. I know it won't change anything, but that's the way it is. He's waking up, Mr. Gão. You were talking in your sleep. Are you a friend of the white head? I love that guy. He's always helped me. He's a great man. I bought this boat with the money he lent me. You've seen him before? -Yeah, I.. -Yeah? I saw him once, a very long time ago. I had the impression that you had already worked with him. What's your name? Ramiro. Toca, tell Mr. Ramiro the time when... you got lost in the jungle with all those monkeys. There were more than 200 of them. Everything was all foggy and misty. They shit on their hands and threw the shit in my face. There was shit everywhere. Shit all over the place. So, how do you like that, Mr. Ramiro? Shit all around. =Good day to you! This time, I haven't forgotten you, Mr. Maruin. I brought back the tobacco you asked me for. Oh, thanks. - What about the ammunition? - On the way. I've got it here. These are hard to find. It is very sought after. You know how it is. These things are prohibited to sell. This time, I couldn't even get 7 liters of gas. You brought me back only a few skins, and they aren't great. Fawns are rare. And the jungle is moving away. Hide it for me. You dirty thief! ♪ ~In your hand, ♪ ~In your hand, in your hand, ♪ ~Ava the bird - That's you? ♪ ~(Ava's song) You know what this is, little Indian shit? Do you know what 'sour grapes' is? You don't know anything about it at all. Discover the world, have beautiful clothes, eating succulent meat, have soft skin... Whiskey! I've had it all before. One day, I stole a bottle of whiskey in the admiral's cabin. I drank it ass dry. Glug, glug, glug. Ass dry. It goes down better than an ice cream. Have you eaten that yet? Speak, for God's sake! No. Of course you've never had ice cream. You only know how to eat mosquitoes and lice. So, explain to me. Why I stayed in this damn jungle for so long, to kill a handful of people who eat mosquitos and lice? Want a snack just pick some lice. What am I going to do with you? Why don't you leave? Get the hell out of my way! Come on, go away! Go away! Get the hell out of my way! Avaeté! Avaeté! Avaeté This recorded chant comes from a tribe of Indians which no longer exists. They're all dead. Some from the diseases that we passed on to them, a good number murdered, and the rest have mixed with us. I'd like to talk to you about it. How many of you have had land from which you've been removed? I would like to listen to your story. Who wants to talk? No one wants to take the floor? Since no one wants to, I'm going to do it myself. I know there's a company who wants to invade your land. And they say... ..they'll relocate everyone. It's always how it starts. With promises. And then, they're killing one of you. Then they burn down a house, then destroy everything. Why did you come back, for God's sake? You don't know that I killed your whole tribe? You don't exist anymore. Just don't exist anymore! You would have done better to stay in the jungle. Your place is over there. It's not enough shit to have bad dreams all night. I also have to look at you all day. You belong in the jungle. And I'm going to the city. Not to the city. To the sea. ♪ Sea ♪ When she breaks on the beach ♪ It's beautiful, it's beautiful. What did you feel when you saw a white man for the first time? The white man has hair like that of the monkey, and he nods like a turtle. I'm a wretch, cabin boy. Miserable. I don't know anything. Absolutely nothing. You can't stay with me, cabin boy. Or you'll become like me. I can't even read. You still have that shit used to... record what we say? -Can I confess? I want to talk. -Calm down. - I want to unburden myself, Father. - Relax. Calm down! Father, Father I saw... I saw, Father... I saw with these two eyes, as I am looking at you... Father, I saw... What? I saw a woman be hacked in half, Father, like a side of beef. Like a side of beef, Father. A side of beef! And the blood was spurting all around, Father. =The blood was spurting from everywhere, Father. =They killed everyone! I saw it all. That's what happened. No one survived. You have to understand, my son, that this is not a confession. It's an accusation. It must be hunger. Let's go eat. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. I can finally share, to the knowledge of all, the story of the massacre of the Avaeté Indians, from Mato Grosso. The charge was handed to me by Father Bruno, from the parish of Fontanilha. The father recorded testimony of one of the participants in the massacre. Remorse drove him to come and confess to the parish priest. If you will allow me, I'm going to play this recording for the assembly to hear. This tape was recorded by me, Father Bruno, on October 12, 19... Ava and Father Bruno, friends. Yeah...Yeah. Good friends. Until he finds out that you steal in the middle of the night. These Church people eat too much anyway. Ava and Ramiro, friends. Why Ramiro doesn't live with me and Father Bruno? I'm going to stay hidden here having a good time, cabin boy. Because if they catch me, I'm screwed. - Crocodile... - Crocodile. ~ Kiyah (Avaeté) . ~ Kiyah. - Bird... - Bird. ~ Tiha. ~ Tiha. - Earth... - Earth ~ Vaima. ~ Vaima. - Um, Monkey... - Yes.

No. I'm scared. I know I shouldn't be, but sometimes I feel weak, and I'm afraid. I pray to God that he will give me the courage to carry this. But sometimes I falter. But a burden our hands, ~Tamé (share). ~Tamé How beautiful it is! When is the baptism? Sunday, at the river, down the street. I want a nice party for the whole parish. I want a cake, decorations, and an accordionist. - All right? - Yes. See you on Sunday, then. -On Sunday. -Good. = Goodbye. Father Bruno? I'm Clara Mendes. I brought you a letter from Germany. My co-worker. I'm back in Brazil, Father Bruno after years abroad. I'm doing a job for the Miseria Nostra Foundation about the works of religious people. - Come inside. - It's an interesting job. I'm doing some research about your efforts. Your work is very important. This must be known abroad. At least in Germany. Ava. This woman was sent to me. She has to do a report about our work. The solution must come from you. Me, I think that we have to occupy the ground, and plant, as much as possible. The virgin lands are easier to steal. Father, we can't move on. We don't have any refuge anymore. I'm tired of running away. You know me well, isn't that right? You know which side I'm on. Is there another solution? Any solution? There must be one. This is our last hope. If they face the owner of the company, they'll be massacred . Like your people. Come. Come on, quick! Father, what massacre are you talking about? Ava is the only survivor from the tribe of the Avaeté. They were slaughtered with machine guns and dynamite. Who did this? Why do they need so much land to live on? Ava, for the rich man, the land is not used to live on. Police station - Mr. Cardozo? - Yes. We are at your disposal, though we have few means. But if we can help you.. We will surely need two machine guns, with ammo. We'll see about that later. For the moment, this case needs absolute discretion. He's hard to find. Do you hear, white head? Elias, Gão. My name is Elias. Yeah. It damn sure is Mr. Elias. He must have found a good hiding place. I know all these nooks and crannies better than anyone. I threw a lot of dogs at his heels. But so far, nothing. And the priest? The Father. There are people you can trust who watch him, even at night. And I guarantee you that Ramiro is not around. You pressing your luck in the lottery, Mr. Elias? Open your eyes, Gão. Do your job. You can count on us, Mr. Elias. We'll take care of it. Toca! Toca!!! Once upon a time, the Avaeté were small and weak. Then, a giant eagle appeared. He threatened all the Avaeté. He had huge claws thick as tree trunks, a neck that reminded you of a tapir, (pig-like mammal) and wings bigger than a banana leaf. One day, the giant eagle ate an elder's aunt. The sister of his father. The elder, a father, took his two sons, and planted his children in the river, heads just above the water, and there they grow up to become tough to avenge the death of their relative. Every 5 days, their mother brought cassava bread for them to eat. (local root) The other Indians must have known nothing. When they became men, their father let them out. They returned to the village with their parents. Everyone was afraid of such great men, such as no one had ever heard of. The father built a huge house, made of buriti wood. (large local Palm) for them to live there. Their father spoke to them of the giant eagle who had devoured their aunt. The two young people left in search of the eagle to avenge the death of their aunt. And where did it go, that giant eagle? Nice Jeep! What's your name? Clara. Miss Clara. You are a friend of the parish priest, Miss Clara? He gave me an appointment. He was supposed to arrive today. We are booked in the same hotel? Surely. There is only one. Are you a friend of the Father's? You're very nosy, Miss. That's my job. You don't have to answer. You too, you're curious. Yeah, well. It's coming up. Hey. Stop. That's the place. We've arrived. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Sickle, an axe... -I hope these help. -Thanks. Just what we needed. You're welcome. Now you can get started. Father, two men are looking for you. Dad said to tell you that they must be policemen. But in a moment, glory, commitment... Turn that shit off, Gambeta! Excuse me for coming to your home like this. But I have to talk to you privately, you see. Ava works here with me. He's staying. Wait a moment. My name is José Ribamar. I'm an Inspector with the federal police. I've been collecting testimonials about the case you denounced, the massacre of the Indians on the eleventh parallel. It's been so long already. I thought that the case was forgotten. That's not my accusation. I just sent the recording. It's exactly that I want to talk to you about. I need to hear it from this Ramiro da Silva. You need to look higher than Ramiro. See who's at the top. Do you know Ramiro? Do you know where he is? We all know him. But we don't know where he is. Oh, but Father, surely other people have knowledge of the investigation. And as you know, Ramiro must also interest them. You're not protecting anyone by not telling me where he is. On the contrary. I'd better find him first. I really don't know where he is. All right. I'm at the hotel. If you change your mind, if you want to talk to me, you know where to find me. Father, I would like to interview you about the massacre. No. Can I have a letter of reference for the Bishop of São Pedro? Of course. Of course. I think we should stay here for a while. The house and land are abandoned. Soon the rainy season will get started. In this state, the house can't protect us. Tomorrow I'll go up on the roof and change the broken tiles. You don't really care about the house. It's the police who you are worried about. No man can ever escape his fate. Ava does not follow the customs of his people. Ava can't seem to be a white guy. Ava couldn't avenge his people, but he must help his friend. Ramiro is my friend. I know where he is. Father Bruno, you know I know. You never asked. But you know I know. Ava, you have taught me more than I taught you. But I think you have to stay away from all this history. Your people have already suffered too much. Good morning. Mr. Ribamar, I'm making a documentary about the beauty of the region. Now I'm going to São Pedro. On my return, I'd like to interview you. Is it possible or not? To talk about what? I don't have anything to tell you, young lady. We could talk about problems of the region. I'm not from the area. Clara! I'm going to load up the Jeep all alone? Oh, my God. Always in a bad mood! I'm leaving for São Pedro. When I get back, we'll talk. Yes, Mr. Ribamar? - Shall we go? - Are you used to walking? It's a long way. That's what I came for. You can unpack everything again. Shit. We're staying here. I think they found Ramiro. Good... good... I brought the man back that I told you about. So, officer. You want me to talk? I don't just want you to talk. I also want you to come with me. Quite a few people want to know what you have to say. You must stay in a safe place. The only safe place for me, officer, is the upper deck of the flagship, Tamandaré. I spent 20 years on that raft. Do I have to get into this? You have no choice, Ramiro. It's not just a story about a massacre. And you well know it. Okay. There were 6 men, Inspector. They told me we were there to collect poaia. And finally it happened, this awful thing. You've already said that. I want to know who was in command, who gave the orders. That's what I'm interested in. I'm on your side. The leader had white hair, Inspector. He was running things. But Machado, the owner of the company, gave the orders. Mr. President, I ask you to subpoena Mr. Antonio Machado owner of "Machado and Brothers", for him to appear as the main author of the "12th day Massacre" of the Avaeté Indians... Wait here a moment. Ok, Gambeta. Stay posted and be vigilant. STOP Entry prohibited. Hey! Your friend is smart. He turns around to leave. Why aren't you going with him? No buses pass here. Only the guests of Mr. Machado are welcome. Ah, isn't he here? He's in Brasilia on business. He's flying back next week, for the meeting with the mayors of the region. There will be governors of states, and Ministers... Yes, I'm told. I'm also told that you were piloting. That's none of your business. And the massacre of Indians, is that my business? If you want to play with fire. You know I can stop at any time. It's better to cooperate. There is no immunity for anyone. Let's stop here. Otherwise, it will end badly. Take it easy, man. I'm not interested in you. It's Machado I want to see. Do this.. Give this letter to your boss, he knows exactly what it's all about. Listen. Mr. Machado got rid of of all the region's communists. I'll ask him to take a ride south... The first wave against the bastard. We're closing in. I'm not going. I'm not going, do you understand? I didn't make you the Commissioner for nothing. Machado, It's not me. This is the Inspector that I told you about. Then stop him! Buy him! They can't make me appear. Me! But this Inspector is incorruptible, Machado. All right. I get it. This is not a job for you. All of a sudden, I saw all Avaeté, Father Bruno. All Avaeté were born again, in another place. But still on the bank of a river. They were all having fun as they always did. They had garb made of coot and genipa (feathers and fronds) covering their whole body. On their head, and their chest. But for it to happen, Ava must follow the customs of his tribe, just as his father did. Ava must avenge his people, like they ask. If Ava respects the customs of his people, then he will be able to be reborn stronger, like the moon who dies and comes back even more sparkling. But Ava has not yet respected the customs. Ava has an Indian face. He can't have the face of a white man. Ava's face is an Indian's face. Ava has no face like a white man, Father Bruno. Ava doesn't have a white face. Deputy Marcelo Palmeira dies in an accident. Since you're so curious, I'll tell you what I was doing in the damn bush. I was acting like a sucker, like a sucker! That's what I was doing. Yeah! I'm not part of the game. I'm not one of them. - Were you in charge of the prisoner? - I was doing my job! Where are you going? I'm following orders. The last one is to get the fuck out of here. Don't go. What did Ramiro tell you? What did Ramiro say to you? You mustn't go. You have to stop the murderer of Father Bruno. You still have a lot to learn, you little ignoramus. I don't have anything to learn. You're a coward. You bet your ass, yes! I'm just an employee. There are people high up. You said it yourself. Where is Ramiro? Where is Ramiro?! Your friend Ramiro's been declared crazy. He's in São Paulo. And you best take care of yourself. Get it? Let's go, Gambeta! ..we'll put them face to face. I'll phone in. Yeah. Go ahead. She'll make a call. These tags to claim our baggage, and then we'll be on our way. Come on. Clara, Clara! Ava is missing. -Oh, my God. -Come! Come! Let's find him! - So, did you find him? - No. We've been looking everywhere, all over the place. We even went to the morgue. Not the slightest trace. Maybe he's looking for his friend. I haven't got a clue. You have to postpone this TV interview. What innocence! These years abroad have propelled you to another world. Bárbara, isn't it newsworthy? The massacre of a tribe, the murder of a parish priest, and the curious death of a Deputy. At that time, we already put the massacre on the news. And there's no proof the Deputy's death wasn't accidental. And the priest who dies, I don't know where, over a dispute between peasants. Are you sure you want to connect everything and accuse Machado? Bárbara, you must give me this TV interview. You know it better than I do. In this country, what is not mentioned on TV did not happen. Let's see if you are hearing me. I understand your reasoning. I understand completely. But you're taking on a guy...Shit. It's not just anyone. It's the Kingmaker himself. He has immense power in this country. You're in another world. In another world? It's all of you who are asleep. Wait just a minute, Mr. Indian. Hey, Indian! Mr. Indian! Indian! Come here! Indian wants a man-stick If you don't give him the stick, he'll try to take it. Gibberish Come here. Indian wants a man-stick If you don't give it to him... - Yes, please? - I'm here to speak with Mr. Machado. One moment, please. We are living in the era of the supermarket and not the general store. Responsibility for land use belongs to industry, associated with international capital. - Okay with you? - Just fine. Continue. Please excuse me. I'm not a good speaker. Have you ever had any problems with a tribe of Indians? Our nation has a great destiny. A handful of primitives won't be the brake on the progress of this country We will be the new world power. And you're talking to me about Indians! What do you have to tell us about the 'Committee of Inquiry'? Cut the camera! Mr. Elias will see you out. You'll excuse me, please. You are never alone.

If you don't talk, you'll be lost. And so will we all be lost. Ava is of the Avaeté Indians. White people talk too much. And they know even less. I have nothing to say. And you, Ramiro, do you want to say something? I'm not crazy, young lady. If they killed a parish priest who had nothing to do with the massacre, what will happen to me? Me, a sailor screwed up and trashed. No. No, no. I did not participate in any massacre, no. Ramiro, just tell us what you have already said to the police. They can't do anything for you, but maybe I can. I never said anything to the police. You have nothing to lose. I'm your friend. Have faith in me. Please, Ramiro, speak up! Don't kid yourself. It's easy for you to film me here. But I wish you'd see it from my place. Speak up, Ramiro. Talk, damn it! Ava, talk. Speak up, Ava. Tell us. Ramiro, speak up. Speak up, please. It will unburden you.

Psychiatric hospital. This here is Ramiro. Accused of being the one in charge of the massacre of the Avaeté Indians in Mato Grosso. This here is Ava, the only survivor. Me, Clara Mendes, journalist, I'm accusing Antonio Machado of being the author of the massacre of the Avaeté Indians, and for having ordered the murder of Father Bruno Schiafino, as well as that of Deputy Marcelo Palmeira. Finally, I am a witness of injustice and an illegal psychiatric imprisonment in order to invalidate any declaration, and to render it inadmissible, that this man could make. Listen to this.

What's on your mind, cabin boy? You think...? Do you think we're screwed? You think that we're really screwed? You can read, can't you? The educated priest taught you. Do you know what this is?

Our Heaven has many Avaeté, and many friends of the Avaeté, so many people that they could fill a city. Macaws, hoplias, (a local fish) many kinds of birds and fish. All around, the Avaeté and other people. Quality people like good honey. Where the mother of the Avaeté met the light of the sun, we are all reborn into the cycle. Walking as a panther not disturbing ashes. As a sparrow hawk flying against the wind, existing in one spot. And as the thunder allows the rain to fall, So too lightning comes forth with the rumble. It's covered. We have permission. We can go there, under my responsibility. I must be in really bad shape. The man doesn't even want me to stay here. He doesn't want another youngster making waves.

Ava has often heard this story. Let's see if it's true. I told you the truth. I wasn't making it up, cabin boy. Didn't I tell you that the sea looked like this? Hey? There it is! Am I crazy, cabin boy? That's just the shoreline. We only see a little. It continues far beyond the horizon. Yes. Yes. You can spend... You can spend... months and years, on this salty carpet, you won't see any end... never an end, cabin boy. Let's dance, cabin boy. Let's dance, just as you taught me. Who knows? By dancing... maybe we'll become...become... lighter and lighter. Maybe we can... Fly! Fly, cabin boy. Fly, cabin boy... like a bird. A bird.

How long? - How long, my God? - Don't cut it. Let it run. I was once the sinless earth. I was once the clean water. I was once the pure air. I was once the free man. Subtitler's note: Opening events are an accurate recreation of the "Massacre at 11th Parallel" in 1963. The events resulted in the death of over 3,500 members of the Cinta Larga tribe. Antonio Mascarenhas Junqueira, head of the rubber firm "Arruda, Junqueira & Co." planned the attack. He said: ‘These Indians are parasites, they are shameful. It's time to finish them off, it's time to eliminate these pests. Let's liquidate these vagabonds.’ 134 Officials were charged with over 1,000 crimes for their involvement. In 1975, José Duarte de Prado, pardoned less than 1 year on a 10 year sentence, was the sole convicted. At trial, he said: ‘It's good to kill Indians – they are lazy and treacherous.’ Only two survived. This subtitling adaptation was created by your friend, Quester.
