Pal?ts, wa?t for me! We'll swim together! Wait lor me! - Bye, Bru! - Palits, wait lor me! You're too slow! l said, wait lor me! You're so fat! You're so lat! ll l catch you, l'll pound you llat! You're such a slow runner! You're so lat! Well, you're skinny! You're still lat! Palits! Bru! Palits! - Palits, you're too much! - Clients! You're just lucky because our clients are here. Dino, your lriend's getting in my nerves! Nuel, you'll have to take care ol this. - Okay, boss! No problem! - Stop calling me boss. - Marian, l'll go ahead! - Dino, thank you! Good morning, ma'am! Mang Boy, you're late again! Didn't l warn you about being tardy? l always tell you that each project... ls a chance lor us to be recommended lor other events. - l'm sory, ma'am. - Don't be late again! Bru, take a pose! Never mind! You might just waste your lilm. Bru is mad! Why should l be mad? You just don't want to waste your shot on your best lriend... Who saved your lile... And who helped you get this photo and video coverage opportunity. l know l owe you ''big'' time... so stop being mad at me. l was just being sentimental. l remember my debut party where you're my escort. Because your designated escort had chickenpox. You didn't really want to be my escort because you were too shy to dance. l only said that because you didn't invite me to be your escort. That's the problem with you! lnstead ol saying what you want... You always wait lor good lortune to lall on your lap! Just like when we were in Grade Four... You wanted to be Joseph in the Christmas play... but you didn't raise your hand. So, you ended up as a shepherd and you cried all day. When your uncle ollered you a slot in an advertising lirm... You thought about it too long that someone else got the job. Are you also going to talk about the time when l was still a letus? Fetus? Is letus another name lor a baby lizard? Do you know what you were called when you were a baby? Cute baby! All piglets are cute! Palits, you've gone too lar! Are you ready, baby? l'll take your picture. That's broken! lt's not! l thought it's broken. There's noth?ng l won't ty - Just to make you m?ne - Aren't you tired ol that song? No. lt's like he's singing to me, right? Why will he sing that song lor you? Why not? First love never dies! That was just puppy love, Marian! - Stop dreaming! - l don't care! Lance is still my hero! - Do you remember-- - When you were in Grade One? He delended you lrom the bullies? Uh-huh. Oh, why don't you sm?le my only star? - Hold it! - Sh?ne on, baby! - Sm?le, my only star! - Hello? Yes... uhm... no. l'll just call you. l haven't decided yet. l'll call you again! There are mosquitoes here! Okay. l'm sory. Bye. What's wrong with you? Who are you calling a mosquito? You! Nosy brat! Nosy brat?! ll you do that again-- Ouch! Just stop it! Wake up, Sleeping Bru-ty! You're home! All l need is a pan, and then l can ly you! - Time to eat! The ham's ready! - Palits! l thought it was Lance already. You were dream?ng of ham? No! Palits, just wait till l get thin. That won't happen. Believe me! It will happen. - Marian... - Hey, Ral_! Good evening. lt's late already. Uhm, good night. Good night! Take care! - Abi... - Good night! lt's already late... - Marian! _ and you' re still ente_aining suitors? That doesn't rellect well on you. Right, Manuel? You're too harsh. - Hi, Mom! - Sweetheart! Palits! Manuel! Dad! l didn't know you're already here. Ouch! Not you too, Dad! l was just joking. Let's eat! Hey, you're getting bigger! Dad! For a change, we should eat out. Right, Dad? Well, this is eating out! ls that ready? - Dad, here's your shirt. - Don't let him wear his shirt yet. You look cute! - l'll take your picture. - Girls, come on! It's a photo session! You'll take my picture? But l'm starting to smell bad! Wait! l'll join you, too! That's going to take a long time! Let me help you. Why don't you take the picture? Are you sure you know how to use that? Ready! One...two... Okay! l'm really good, right? l told you, l know how to use that camera! Are you sure that's going to come good? Yeah! Manuel should have taken my picture. Dad tells me that when you take my picture... l look like an international beauty queen. Manuel is really talented. l don't know why he's contented being Dino's assistant. Proper places! Besides, l'm not his assistant. l'm a co-owner! You're partners, but he gets $O percent. You only get 20. What's wrong with that? That is still a decent job, and he works hard lor it. That's what l'm saying! Right, Dad? Just like Ral_. Right, Dad? You just have to mention Ral_'s name. Dad, l know Palits has a decent job... But he can still become popular. As in really popular! Just like Lance? Yes! Just like Lance! Isn't Lance impressive? He really pursued his dream to become the lead singer ol a rock band. He has a clear goal. Now, they're perlorming in Asia. Then, the US. And soon after, Europe! After that, they'll be in Babuyan Island! You're so bad! Don't mention Babuyan Island again! Just eat! Lad?es and gentlemen... please welcome the lead s?nger of Or?on...

Did you see it? My dog tag! Abi! Where have you been? We just had some collee. Have we run out ol collee that you have to go out to drink some? How come you can stay up late with Manuel? That's dillerent! Our lriendship is Platonic. Come on! Manuel, are you done with our pictures? - l'll give them tomorrow. - Tomorrow then, okay? Hello? Uncle. Uncle. Were you given an invitation to Cedric's exhibit? Yes. Manuel! Why weren't you able to go to our reunion? l didn't have the time. - There's too much work to be done. - Really? That's good! You have lots ol work to do. That's why you turned down Cathy's oller. lt's not that l turned her down, Uncle. lt's just that l'm not ready yet. When will you be ready? When you have run out ol opportunities? You know, il your lather was still alive... He would lorce you to get into the arts or something else. ll dad were still alive... he would have probably encouraged me to pursue my happiness. Are you happy with what you're doing? Manuel!

We'll see each other again! He won't remember you! He'll remember me! We have a special connection! Want to bet that he won't recognize you? Sure! Wow! Cedric's so talented! Let's attend this! l don't want to. Your insecurity's running at lull blast again! Aren't you proud that your relatives are talented artists? Proud. Well, that's it! You know, your relatives are really good people. You're the one who's avoiding them. What's the real reason why you came here? Well, we should plan how Lance and l will meet each other again. We? Why am l included in this plan? lsn't that what good lriends do lor each other? l'm not a good lriend. Because l saved your lile. Do you want me to relresh your memoy? What's the plan? Good! We'll lollow Lance lrom the airport. Then, we'll listen to the news to know where he's headed. Hey, boys and g?rls! We have a flash report... regard?ng the arr?val of Or?on here ?n Man?la. We've got our Ch?ka Patroller, B?ll?e! Hey, guys! The good news ?s that they are here. But l cannot tell you exactly where they are headed. Why?

Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Dino... your brother's spending too much time in our house. There's nothing wrong with that. Hey Manuel... it's embarrassing! You're even the one who's visiting the guy! Our parents did not raise us to be like that! l can't talk with him in our house. l can't talk with him here. Where can we talk? What's that? Are you talking back to me? Abi, you should know better than to talk back to your older sister. You'll never win against her. What are those? Are those the birthday party pictures? No, these are dillerent. Sellish! You know, Palits, you're wasting your talent. Don't you want to be an award-winning photo journalist like your dad? l don't have my lather's talent. Besides, what il l get hit while l'm taking photos during crosslire? Well, you have a dillerent talent! Why don't you oller your service to an advertising agency? What il they ask lor my diploma? Then, linish your thesis. l don't have money lor my tuition lee. Then, borrow money lrom your uncle. Why are we talking about me? Aren't we supposed to be talking about Abi? Abi, you're lucky that mom and dad allow your suitors to visit you. During my time, my suitors-- You had suitors? l thought you were challenging them to a boxing match. ln the right corner, weighing 240 pounds... Stop laughing, Abi. l'm telling you the truth. - You should listen to me-- - Marian, my classmates told me... that Orion would be having a mall tour. Really? When?

Even a clue? l'm not really allowed to do that. Bru, stop it. It's embarrassing! What do you mean it's embarrassing? - l'm just asking a question. - Let me take care ol it. Do you see what l see? Where's Lance? l don't see Lance. lt doesn't matter! That's Orion! He'll be llying with them! Wait! Sir, l want to transler to their llight. l'll just check, ma'am.

Do you have a girllriend? None yet. Why? Well, l like my best lriend. But il l tell her how l leel, she might get angy with me. Fool! What il she doesn't get angy? Well, l'm still saving up.

Just like you. lt's an old place but it's still so beautilul. Lance? Lance? Lance? For you. - Thank you. - Shall we? This is where my parents got married. And this is where l want to get married too. Who's the bride? l hope it's you. Really! Nothing, let's go. This is the spot where Don Miguel Lopez de Legazpi... and Datu Sikatuna made a blood compact. Didn't they get drowsy? Why? Because you lose blood... During blood compact. ll they were anemic, wouldn't they get drowsy? ls that a joke? You're so cruel! l was just joking. l'll take your picture! Okay, smile! Jeez. Hey, guys! Listen to me! l think some people say they're like giant moles. But l personally think they're like giant breasts! That one over there! Hey, guys! Look! You have to look! That's cup A. And this one, right here, is cup D. How about you, Mommy? Do you want to have a cup ol collee with me? - No! No! l'm scared, Lance! _ Aren't they cute? Go on! - Come on! Closer! - No! l'll stay here. l'm okay here. They're so cute! Wow! They've got big eyes! l think they've been drinking a little too much collee. Drink decal lrom now on! Thank you vey much! Enjoy your lunch! l'll be back later! Are you happy? Ol course. Why did you ask? lt's just that you don't laugh the way you do when Manuel jokes around. Stop worying! Maybe we just don't share the same sense ol humor. But that doesn't mean that l'm not happy. Your happiness means a lot to me. What are you saying? l'm happy. Just like right now. lt's just that you're leaving again. Let's spend more time together. Can you go with me to Singapore? _ promise? - Yes. Take it slow! You might choke. Do you want this? l'll just take your picture. - Okay! - Hey, look! It's Lance! Lance! You're lollowing us. - Marian! - Hi! - Why is it... - Where are you go?ng afterth?s? lt's a secret! Lance, do you want to dance? But l have two left leet. Well, l have two right leet! Let's dance! It's okay! The boat is sinking! Group yourselves into 6! Now... group yourselves into 4! Okay! Group yourselves into 2! Okay! Once again! Group yourselves into 7! Why are you cying? What's wrong? Marian, why are you cying? Hey! Say something. l don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Is that possible? Tell me the reason. l miss this. l miss you. lt's your lault! You've been avoiding me! What do you want me to do? l'm like a cray dog tailing after you and your boylriend. Lance and l are so dillerent, Manuel. Ol course! Especially in body size. - Your arm alone-- - That's not it! We're so dillerent. Marian... Ol course... You have just reconnected... After 12 years! l'm sure both ol you are going through an adjustment period. Palits... Don't you like Lance? What?! No! l mean, Lance is okay. ln lact, he's okay. Are you jealous ol Lance? ll l get a girllriend, won't you get jealous? Ol course l would! Even il they're not yet your girllriends l want to scratch out their eyes! That's what l meant. That's why l'm staying away lrom you. l think we need to... Put some distance lrom each other. Right? Space? Why do things have to change? Because this is a dillerent situation, Marian. ln the same way that you're adjusting to Lance... We also have to learn to adjust to changes. Just like what you said belore... You'll leave me... When l'm okay on my own. But you don't seem okay yet. No. Maybe because we're so used to doing the same things together. We are always together. Maybe that's why other people lind it hard to be part ol our lives. Maybe that's why it's hurting us too. You sound like you're leaving me. Well, it seems that you want me dead. Am l dying? Don't be sad. No matter what happens... l will always be your best lriend. Nothing will ever change that. Hey, are you okay? l'm okay. Why didn't Nuel come with us? He has to go somewhere else. lf you have no respect for your parents... Have some respect for yourself! You were gone lor several days... With a man we hardly know! l was with Manuel. We gave in to your requests. We tried to understand your reasons. ls there no end to this madness ol yours? - To Manuel? - To Manuel? No. l already said ''yes'' to Lance. Let's eat! - Lance, do you want to taste this? - Great! That's delicious! Mom cooked that. - Give me your plate. - Thank you! Shall we start eating? Here, Dad! Marian told me you're in the llower business. - Yes. - Yes. What's your lavorite llower? - Roses. - Me too! - Do you like beel broth? - Yes. - That's also delicious! - How sweet! Thank you! So, do you like to cook? Yes. That's great! l like to eat. Marian, let him taste this. What is it? Beel steak. lt looks dillerent. lt's called ''bistek'' here. Just like Herbert Bautista's nickname. What was that? We call it ''b?stek'' here in the Philippines. Okay. This is beautilul. Thank you. Have a drink, Lance. - Thank you. - It's my husband! Excuse me. l'm coming, Dad! Your lamily is just charming. l knowthat! Worm! That is a worm! - l know. - Mom! - You're so good! Wow! - Ol course! - You're so good! - They're still warming up to you. - It might take some time. - l understand. lt will take a while lor them to get used to me. But l enjoy seeing where you live and knowing your lamily. l leel l know you better. That's also how l lelt when l met your mom. What's this? These are pictures since l was a child. Look! l look dillerent, don't l? These were taken during my graduation. Th?s was taken dur?ng Chr?stmas. Dad was even supposed to dress up as Santa Claus. lt was really funny. Oh, well! You and Manuel have so much histoy together. Ol course. We're childhood lriends. lt's not just that. l mean... You guys have been through so much. He's in evey important event in your lile. And no matter what l do... l can't have that. Are you jealous? Yes... vey. But it's okay... Because l'll have your present and your luture. That's why you're coming with me to Singapore, right? - Are you ready lor the exhibit? - l think so. ls there anything l can do to help? Just be there on time lor the ribbon cutting. l'll be there. Cathy, what is this... Manuel! What are you doing? Give that to me! Just bring your photographs. That's all you have to do. We'll take care ol the rest. That's what l'm about to say. But really, Manuel. l'm vey happy lor you. Finally, you're giving direction to your lile. This is what your lather has always wanted. That's great! Maybe you can include my pictures with Pablo in your art exhibit. lt's only limited to art photography. But l'm artsy-lartsy mysell! - Come! Let's have some juice. - l'll drink it later. But l have already prepared it! Come! Leave that lor a while. Grandma, you can have your photos... Mar?an, ?t's Manuel! D?dn't you tell that Mar?an ?s the best ?n town? That's why l got her as my floral arranger! - l'll just get the photos. - l have to go back to work. And here... l will place some Iong-stemmed roses and tulips. ls that okay with you? l like that! Okay! Ten years lrom now... we'll be celebrating our 50th wedding anniversay. When that time comes, l still want you to be partners. 50 years? You've been together lor so long. lt's true love! Just like you and Manuel... We started out as good lriends. And when you reach a certain age... The romance starts to lade. What remains is lriendship. But there are other relationships... Where the couple start as strangers... Or even enemies. But ol course, it's always better il you start out as lriends... Just like you and Manuel. That's why l've been telling Manuel... To tell you how much he loves you! Oh, here he is! Manuel! Tell her how much you love her! Oh why does he love play?ng stup?d? He says he's too shy... Or ?nsecure! Say ?t! You should f?ght for your love! Go, go, go! He loves you! Step on it. Step on it! Why didn't you tell me? Why did l have to learn it lrom someone else? Marian, what's the use? You've already got Lance. Even belore he came back into my lile! Why didn't you tell me? Why did you keep it lrom me? You did nothing but insult me! You tell me that l have big arms. That l'm lat. That l'm desperate. - That l'm tying hard. - Marian, you should have known... That you have always been beautilul to me. You were so good in hiding that. l didn't leel that way. Why should l even tell you... When you talk ol nothing else but Lance? How conlident Lance is. How perlect Lance is. Evey time you say that... l leel so small compared to him! lt made me realize that l don't deserve you... Because l can say nothing great! l have nothing to prove! That l can never be as perlect as Lance! The truth is you are a coward! - You're not just insecure! You're a coward! - All right! l am a coward! Yes! Because il you truly love me you should have lought lor me! Why? Il l told you that l love you... Would you have told me that you love me too? Yes! Maybe. l don't know. l'm not sure. l leel so conlused. l leel that... l leel that l love you... More than a lriend. l want to embrace you. l want to kiss you. l want us to be together. l want you to be mine. But because l'm your best lriend... l want you to think twice... About how you really leel. Maybe you're just conlused. You're just scared because you and Lance are starting anew. And because l know... That l'm giving you time to think... You might realize that... it is not me that you will choose. Still, l will say the same thing to you. Exactly the same, Marian. - That was really lunny! - Yeah! ll Beng were with us, she would have laughed at it too! - Is that your sister? - Marian? Good evening and good night. Ral_, you love Abi, don't you? How did you know that you love her? Pardon? Marian, your situation is dillerent. There is only Ral_ in my lile. But you are torn between a habit and a dream. You are torn between a man that you're comlortable with... And a man you've always dreamed of. Am l mak?ng sense? The po?nt ?s you have to make a dec?s?on soon! Not only to end your confus?on... But also to end the confus?on of the two men... Who are hop?ng for your love. Welcome to S?ngapore! Gred?ngs from S?ngapore... The Garden C?ty!

But l just don't love you in the same way you love me. Why? ls it Manuel? How will l make you happy? l thought we had an understanding. l thought you love me. l guess l was wrong. Abi, was I so cruel? l was look?ng for you. Your band mates told me l m?ght f?nd you here. l'm sory. l don't know what to say. l know, no matter what l say... lt will hurt just the same. l'll be lying il l tell you that eveything is alright because it's not. How can l be alright... When the only girl l ever loved just turned me away? l knew l was up against Manuel... But l still gave it my best shot. Now, l accept the lact... that no one else can replace him in your lile. That's all l can do lor now. l can't get angy with you. Goodbye, Marian. l just want you to be happy. Hello? Mom? l've been calling you but you're not answering the phone. We're here at the galley. Galley? What's go?ng on at the galley? It's Manuel's exhibit, remember? The ceremony's about to end. We're leaving already. That's today? Driver, please bring me to Marikina! Yes, ma'am! You're still more beautilul in person. You really love me. Yes... and l have my entire lile to show you.

Even il-- Marian, l love you! l love you too, Palits! l don't think l'm ready, Marian.
