A DaieiCompany, Ltd. Production Tokugawa leyasu, who by winning the Battle of Sekigahara had gained control of the entire nation, nevertheless was always searching for a pretext to destroy the ToyotomiClan. After 15 years, by deliberately misinterpreting an inscription on the bell at Hoko'jiTemple, he at last has the excuse he needed to launch a military campaign against them. The late Hideyoshi's son, Hideyori, and his mother, Lady Yodo, took refuge in the formidable fortress of Osaka Castle, where they were beseiged by leyasu's army. It is the 11th month of the 19th year of the Keicho period . Osaka: The winter campaign. Hideyorisought assistance from Daimyo who had been indebted to the ToyotomiClan, but given that the clan's prospects were bleak, none lifted a fingerto help him, Only two generals, Sanada Yukimura and Goto Mototsugu who lusted for vengeance, and a horde of mercenary ronin, perhaps 701o 801housand in all, rose to his defense. In contrast, leyasu mobilized an army of 200,000 troops, who mounted a textbook siege at Mount Chausu. We are fully prepared, let us not waste this opportunity. I believe that we should launch an all-out attack tomorrow and crush them with a single blow. Crush them with a single blow? Crush them with a single blow? Indeed. They have only 80,000 men. They're just a horde of riffraff. They can't have any real will to fight. They might be a horde of riffraff, but the castle is an impenetrable fortress. There are only two ways to take it. Either we surround it, cut off their supplies, and patiently starve them to death... ...or we fill up the moats, destroy the bastions, and launch a direct assault. Then let us cut off their supplies. Where's Yotoji? Where's Yotoji? I am here. Where's Lady Yodo's cloister? I am here. Where's Lady Yodo's cloister? On the west side of the inner citadel. How many Iga ninja have penetrated the castle? On the west side of the inner citadel. How many Iga ninja have penetrated the castle? There are three of them. Not enough. Get three more skiIled men inside. There are three of them. Have them relay to us every detaiI of the goings- on in the castle... ...especially the movements of Sanada Yukimura. Yes sir. So it's the west side. Order Yamanouchiand Asano to incessantly bombard that side of the castle. Yes sir. Wait. Aim as close as possible. We must gradually increase Lady Yodo's fear. Now go. Yes sir. By the way, we need to shake up the east side as well. I believe it is Yukimura's son who's guarding the Shigino fortress. Mother! Mother! Leyasu is after me. He's trying to kill me! Please try and calm yourself. Please try and calm yourself. That obnoxious bastard leyasu. He kiIled his own wife and had his own son commit harakirito further his designs... ...and now he's going to forsake his granddaughter! Your grandfather is a demon masquerading as a human being! Hey Yukimura. Did you see it? Did you see it? Yes, sir. The fortress is under concentrated fire. What? The Shigino fortress? What? The Shigino fortress? Yes sir. Dispatch! Gate One has just fallen. Don't retreat! Not a single step! Don't retreat! Not a single step! Yes sir. Oh! Saizo. Please retreat, immediately. Retreat? Please retreat, immediately. His Lordship commanded that we must not lose a single soldier untiI the decisive battle. I will draw the enemy's attention. Meanwhile, you must withdraw using the rear gate. Saizo! There are chambermaids in the storage room. Understood. Women! "Kirigakure:" Lit., "Hiding in the Mist" Sir Kirigakure! Lady Akane! Sir Kirigakure!

It is now the spring of the next year, the first year of the Gen'na period . Mount Koya, Kishu Province Signpost: "To Kondo Hall" Thanks for your hard work. What brought you back so quickly? They just began to fill up the moats of Osaka Castle. The moat- fiIling was a condition of the truce. It can't be helped. The agreement was that only the outer moats would be fiIled in. Magistrate Matsudaira is in charge of the operation... ...and he has hired over 5,000 men, who are fiIling in all the moats simultaneously. What? Even the inner moats? Yes. Those at the castle protested most strongly. However, the magistrate replied that the Great Lord had ordered all the moats fiIled in. Not only are they fiIling up the inner moats... ...they are also dismantling every bastion as fast as they can. A castle without moats and bastions is like a man with no arms and legs. Father, how can we... Say no more, Daisuke. We knew this was going to happen eventually, ever since the peace treaty. It was leyasu who started the battle. It was leyasu who offered a truce. In other words, the goal of the battle was the peace treaty. The goal of the battle was the peace treaty? The peace treaty is the method by which he intends to exterminate the ToyotomiClan. Why then did you knowingly fall into leyasu's trap? It is beyond human power to stop the current of time. The ToyotomiClan still had hope before the winter campaign. Several large fiefs remained uncommitted, as they awaited victory or defeat. This is why I urged we adopt an aggressive strategy... ...assault the capital, and assassinate Lord leyasu. However, Lord Hideyoriwas influenced by Lady Yodo, Ono, and others around him... ...and he opted to remain cloistered in the castle. It was then that the fate of the ToyotomiClan was sealed... ...and simultaneously, my fate was clearly sealed. Are you going to go down with the ToyotomiClan? Such is the fate of a warrior who lives in an age of war. How can you say that? We can't just passively surrender to leyasu. Banner: "Sanada-himo." Woven cords used to tie up boxes. Next, Gei'shu province. Next, Gei'shu province. Yes. Lord Fukushima Masanorihasn't returned to his home province at all. According to rumors circulating in towns around his castle, right after the winter truce... ...he asked the Shogun to be allowed to stay in Edo. Good job. Next! Next! That's enough. Even a man with the deepest connections to the ToyotomiClan... ...such as Lord Fukushima, is behaving in this manner. We needn't hear more about the actions of the other fiefs. The Daimyo have all yielded to Tokugawa. It's obvious that they're all out to flatter the Shogun. Our problem is the Shogun. In any case, who was it that infiItrated Sunpu? That was me. So it was you, Hikohachi. What have you to report about Sunpu? All is calm. Calm? Calm? Yes. After they returned from Osaka, there was pandemonium at the castle... ...with much post- war celebration. But eventually things calmed down. Are they recruiting more troops? Purchasing weapons and ammunition? Not at all. It appears that they're not preparing for another battle. Father, don't believe it. Don't worry. I'm sending a courier to Lord Shimazu. To Lord Shimazu? We agreed to exchange information about the Shogun's activities. I appreciate your efforts, leave for Satsuma, early in the morning. Yes, Sir. Everyone, I appreciate your attendance. We have a little sake ready, so relax and enjoy yourselves. I knew it. When is leyasu planning to attack? The real question is, what will be his excuse for war? We have to deduce it. That's the only way to keep the ToyotomiClan alive. How much longer is it going to take to bury the moats of Osaka Castle? I would think roughly half a month to 20 days. Half a month to 20 days... this is a decisive period. Will you accept another mission? To Sunpu, I presume? I want you to report on Lord leyasu's actions, not assassinate him. Understood? I'll let him live, for now. Sunpu And then? What about that Hikohachifellow? They tossed him into the Kinokawa River. I knew that's how he'd end up. I only sent him because you insisted. But Yukimura's far too wily to be duped by a double- agent. And now they know that we fed them false information. Well, Toji, isn't that so? My apologies. Have you anything to report about Kirigakure? Unfortunately, no. Unfortunately? You fool! Kirigakure will certainly infiItrate Sunpu. Find him, no matter what! One-two- three... nine-ten and one-two- three- four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten and... Don't make a sound. Are you a burglar? Or a murderer? Keep quiet! Sir Kirigakure! Lady Akane! Lady Akane! Sir Kirigakure! Come here, quickly. Quickly. Is that your? Don't ask boorish questions, pretend you saw nothing. It's broad daylight. Day or night, any time is a good time to sleep with your lover. Suit yourself! Lady Akane. Why on earth have you? Become a prostitute, you mean? What's the point of asking now? No one knows how to turn back time. Or is there a secret Iga- Ninja technique that can do it? Please leave. Please leave. Lady Akane. Akane died... One month ago, at the port of Shigino. For the sake of completing his mission... ...it is said that a ninja will voluntarily plunge to sure death. You've failed to capture Kirigakure, and yet, here you are. Who is it? Who is it? Umaichi. Wait. Umaichi. Leave. I have not forgiven you. I'm merely giving you another chance. Go. So how are things in Osaka? Sir, it's heating up. I'm sure something serious will happen. Sir, it's heating up. I'm sure something serious will happen. I'm not interested in your analysis, just report what you've seen and heard. Yes sir. First of all, they're secretly re- digging the moats. Huh? They're trying to restore the moats? Yes sir. Next, they've begun hiring ronin. So they're hiring ronin? So they're hiring ronin? Indeed. Not openly, but they're hiring ronin from all over the nation, by word of mouth. Mercenary ronin. If it means a full stomach, a thousand miles is but a mile to them. The dismissal of their ronin was a condition of the truce, and yet, they're flagrantly... Next. Yes sir. They're encouraging merchants to buy up rice. Merchants are taking advantage of the prices, and have gone on a buying rampage... ...going even as far as Shikoku and Kyushu. And furthermore... They're buying guns and ammunition? Yes, I'm told they're paying any price for them. Hmm, "any price?" "The late Taiko:" Hideyoshi, Hideyori's father. The treasury of the Osaka Castle is packed with gold that was collected by the late Taiko. They're breaking every article of the truce, and openly purchasing weapons. We must immediately make an official protest. Leave it be. Leave it be. Leave it be? Meaning? Honda. You've been by my side for 30 years, and you still don't know what I'm thinking. The essential requirement before starting any war is a just cause. Crushing the subservient and helpless is not war. It is for this reason that we must gather all available information. Keep close watch on Yukimura's every move. The enemy is only one man... Sanada Yukimura. I understand. Honda... what is happening with the newfangled guns we ordered from Holland? They're scheduled to reach the port of Shimizu early tomorrow morning. Indeed, it's only the merchants who get fat. Dismissed. Yes sir. There was a thick mist... I was thrown to the ground... That's about all I remember. Who knows how much later it was... ...but when I regained consciousness, the mist was already cleared. I was on the ground, naked, at the edge of the burned- down fortress. Seven or eight samuraiwere grinning and leering down at me. The Akane that you once knew vanished from this world, along with that mist. That mist... what happened to you was my fault. Do you really believe that? I do. I want you to have this money. Money? I know it's too little, too late, but at least you can buy yourself out with it. Buy myself out? I'm here because I want to be here. That's a lie. You're tormenting yourself on purpose... ...to try and forget the pain in your heart. Come on... take it. I don't want money. Instead, come and visit me, from time to time. Will you visit me? Yeah. As long as you visit me, I don't care what you do in Sunpu. It says that guns and cannons are being moved around... ...but no troops appear to have been deployed. "Osaka faction:" The forces supporting ToyotomiHideyori. That's because there's no need. Unlike the Osaka faction... ...Lord leyasu can quickly mobilize 200 to 300 thousand troops. The question is, when will they declare war? Lord leyasu is waiting for an excuse. It's Anayama Kosuke. I'm back from Osaka. Good job. Draw near. This is a reply from Lord Hideyori. What does he say? He says that it's absurd. Absurd? He says that my thought, namely, that the greatest defense is being defenseless... ...is cowardly drivel. Osaka Castle has been stripped bare, it's not the fortress that it once was. I give it one chance in ten of holding out. That is why the most prudent path is to do as Lord leyasu commands. Lord leyasu is 74 now, we won't have to suffer his presence much longer. But Lady Yodo doesn't understand that. She thinks only of the prestige of the ToyotomiClan. She is blindly sabotaging Lord Hideyori's future. Where is Kirigakure? So his name is Kirigakure? Don't play dumb. You were all over him, in broad daylight. I don't have to know a man's name to fall in love with him. Shut up! So you fell in love with someone without knowing where he's from, or his name? That's exactly right. Fine. We'll see if you really don't know. Now watch closely. Did you see that? My life means nothing to me. This isn't about your life. Women value something more than life itself. Shichiro, do you know what it is? Idiot! It's the face. Make her face utterly hideous. I... I... I don't know. I really don't know! What a stubborn woman. Hey, she thinks this is just an idle threat. What's the matter? Do it. Don't! Please stop! It's Kirigakure! Shichiro! What happened?! Shichiro, what happened?! Shichiro! What? Yukimara has vanished? Yes sir. Three days after he returned from Osaka to Mt. Kudo of Kishu Province... ...he and over 200 retainers vanished in a single night. The living room of the Sanada Mansion had been immaculately cleaned... ...and there was a display of gifts, tagged with the names of those who supported his cause. That's enough! That's enough! Yes sir. You imbecile! Yes sir. Immediately block the route between Sakaiand Koriyama! Yes sir! No matter what, we can't let Yukimura get into Osaka. Prevent it at all costs! It does not matter how. Assassinate leyasu as soon as possible. That's the order from Lord Yukimura. So he's decided that leyasu must die if the ToyotomiClan is to live, eh? What do we do? We're going to do it. We originally joined Lord Yukimura to assassinate leyasu anyway. To us, there is neither Toyotomi nor Tokugawa. My only wish as a ninja is to live in a world that we can use our skills to the utmost. Of course. But there's also the possibility that assassinating Tokugawa... ...will simply cause his clan to be replaced by the Toyotomi. No, Hideyoridoesn't have the ability to rule the nation. It's inevitable that everything will be thrown into civiI war and turmoiI once again. Defeating leyasu and rendering the Tokugawa Clan politically impotent will bring this about. It's the only way to create an era in which each and every ninja can shake the world. I get it. Let's do it. But how? Because of the design of the castle and how it is guarded... ...our usual methods won't even get us inside, let alone assassinate him. Let me go first. It's called " quiet death." It's a virulent poison, enough to kill 50 men. Shh! Sorry I'm late. Ah, thanks. Please. Let's hope this is a toast to success. We will succeed. But should I faiI, I want you to be the next to try, Umino. And even if you faiI, we still have Anayama, Kakei... and Kirigakure. Lady Akane. We've been assigned an important duty. It's impossible for us to see you home. Please, don't worry about me. But this is a problem. You could travel to Mt. Kudo by yourself, but the mountains of Ikoma will be too treacherous. Umm... Sir Kirigakure. If there's anything I could do, please tell me. Please. I appreciate the thought, but I must refuse your offer. You must get yourself out of Sunpu as soon as possible. It's just rats. That feels so good. Ah, Yotoji, that's enough. Yes sir. But just in case... Alright, alright. Yotoji! Yotoji! When we die, there isn't even a corpse. That is the way of the ninja. But he's a lucky one, he gets a grave with flowers on it. Intruders! W... w... wait. I'm not leyasu. What? "Kagemusha:" Lit., "shadow warrior." In this case, it means he is a body-double. I... I... I'm just a kagemusha. P... Please spare me my life. Please! Have compassion! Have mercy! Where is leyasu?! In the bedroom! He's hiding in the bedroom. Come here. Leyasu! Die! You'd be wise to give up. Don't kill him. Capture him alive. Hey, Kirigakure. Are you going to die for the sake of Yukimura? Ninja don't die for the sake of others. What? Ninja are always on their own, at all times. Liar! Yukimura obviously ordered you to assassinate the Lord Shogun. You've trampled Iga into the dirt, all for the sake of your ambition. You, who have betrayed the ninja code, cannot understand me. You pathetic fool. That spittle will surely land back on you. Listen carefully. Nobunaga aggressively tried to crush the ninja. Hideyoshirode the coattaiIs of Nobunaga's war, and planned to exterminate us all. But as you can see, the ninja are still here. So leyasu decided to use them as tools for seizing the nation, you are one such tool. Tools will eventually become unnecessary. Get it, Yotoji? Three men, with different methods, but they are all enemies of the ninja, just the same. Shut up! Listen carefully... There are only two ways out of this stone prison: By telling us where Yukimura is, or by dying. Lady Akane! What are you doing here? You've drugged her! Surprised? I've got Akane, she's right here with me. She answers all my questions, all the while laughing, laughing, and laughing. So where is Kakei? Where is Anayama Kosuke hiding? Lady Akane! You mustn't tell him! Say it. You know where they are. You know. I know. That's right. Where's Kakeihiding? Lady Akane! Say nothing! Say it! Say it! Lady Akane! Lady Akane! Get in! Get in! Ka... kei... is... coming... ...to... help... just... wait. Enter. I hate to disturb you at this time, but we have information regarding Yukimura. Get to the point. Yes sir. As a result of an intensive search... ...we ascertained that he was hiding in a hut at Mount Ikoma. We dispatched men there, but they were quickly noticed. When they arrived, the hut had just been abandoned. Another failure, I see. I am so sorry. We will, of course, continue to keep close watch in Ikoma... ...and also throughout Yamato and Kishu Provinces. I've sternly told Asano of Kishu to stop at nothing to determine his whereabouts... ...in order to keep him out of Osaka. Asano isn't the only one who needs to be ordered to be on the alert. Any news about that ninja called Kakei, the one we failed to capture the other day? We've undertaken a meticulous search, but have no leads as yet. We assume that he has left the area. No, he's still around. Don't you know the ninja code? If a ninja is captured and is unable to escape, he must immediately choose death. The fact that Kirigakure and Anayama haven't committed suicide... ...is proof positive that they have a means of escape. It is impossible for them to escape the stone prison by themselves. And so, Kakei. What else could it be? How's life in a stone prison? Climb the rope. We got something for you to see up here. What's the matter? Are you perhaps waiting for Kakei? Look. Kakei! Lord Yoshinao's wedding will take place on the 12th day of the fourth month. We just got the news via courier from Nagoya. ChiIdren are strange things, I'd never thought Yoshinao would be so useful. The 12th of the fourth is not many days away. Are the presents ready? We have already sent them out. I'm talking about the items we purchased from Holland and England. They're packaged and ready to send. Send them out tomorrow. Send them out tomorrow. Yes sir. Yes sir. Father, when will you be leaving? Yes sir. Today or tomorrow. Tell the Daimyo to the east of Nagoya to... ...schedule their travel so as to arrive on the 10th of the fourth month. Yes. Now, regarding Yukimura, we really need to determine his whereabouts... what's Kirigakure's condition? Today's his fifth day without food, I hear he's getting quite weak. Death by starvation... not the usual way a ninja dies. Yotoji, are you there? I am here, sir. Here's a gracious gift from the Lord Shogun, receive it with gratitude. On the 12th day of the fourth month... ...Lord Tokugawa Yoshinao is getting married in Nagoya. As he was departing for Nagoya, His Lordship left this behind for you to eat. Hey! What happened? Hey! He's dead. What should we do? Catch up with the convoy and get instructions from his Lordship. Yes, Sir. These three died because of you. Maybe you should light a stick of incense for them or something. Lady Akane... don't worry, I'm not a ghost. "Shin-ki:" Lit., "heart-energy." Using the secret art of "shin-ki"... ...I can stop breathing and remain in a death-like state for half a day. Lady Akane... quickly return to your homeland, remake your life, and find happiness. Sir Kirigakure, where are you going? Why do you ask about me? Please take me with you. I will not. All that awaits me is a bloody battlefield. Wait... Sir Kirigakure, you told me to find happiness. I can only be happy if I am close to you. Wait! I am sorry. If you're truly sorry, then please stop following me. I'm just taking the same path you are taking. Hey... Go. Go. Yes. You see? The plan to bury him instead of beheading him has paid off. Yes sir. He's headed for Yukimura. Listen carefully, do not lose track of him, no matter what. Relay these orders to Yotoji. Relay these orders to Yotoji. Yes, sir. Go. Yes, sir. Nagoya... Yatomi... Kuwana... Tomita... Yokkaichi... Oi... Kameyama... Seki... Suzuka... Ibukisan... Nabari... Sir Kirigakure... you detest me because I became a prostitute, don't you? No, I don't. I must not fall in love with you. Why? Why must you not fall in love with me? We ninja are born in darkness, and die in darkness. We have a strict code: " No matter what the circumstances... "... we must never become infatuated or devoted to another." I will still follow you, Sir Kirigakure. I don't care what you think of me. I'm never going to leave you, no matter what happens. I'm glad. I was afraid you had left me behind. Oh... such pretty flowers! The water's cold, want a drink? Thanks. That's good. After you awaken, you must take a new path. On the 12th day of the fourth month, using the wedding of Tokugawa Yoshinao as pretext... ...he'll concentrate all his troops in Nagoya and launch an attack, there's no doubt. Good job. I estimate his forces number about 300,000... My Lordship! Retreat. Lord... Saizo, please give my double a respectful burial. This was a sad necessity... So there is no doubt that you've assassinated Yukimura? I confirmed it with my own eyes. With the outer moats gone, the bastions gone, and now Yukimura gone as well... ...the ToyotomiClan is as good as dead. The rest of our task will be effortless. You said that one needs a just cause in order to start a war. Indeed. They've revived the moats, and hired multitudes of ronin. These breaches of the terms of the treaty are a clear challenge to the Tokugawa. Don't you agree? First year of the Gen-na period , Fourth month, 29th day. Osaka: The summer campaign begins The Toyotomi, unable to reverse their fortunes, can only await the inevitable fall of the castle. Those are Sanada's banners! Quickly investigate! Yes sir. Did you call for me? Saizo... you must immediately escape from the castle. Escape? Why? Thanks to your extraordinary efforts, I can now die a glorious death. I, Yukimura, give you my gratitude. You are a ninja, hired to spy on leyasu. You have no reason to become a martyr for the Toyotomi. So swiftly escape by the underground route, as fast as you can. Your consideration for me is unnecessary. What? I have been taught that a ninja must never possess a human heart... ...that we must be as beasts. However, my humanity finally won out. My Lord. I, a human being, want to share your destiny. Saizo! " I confirmed it with my own eyes," eh? What have you to say for yourself? Who is that opposing us, then? What kind of ninja is it that is fooled by a mere kagemusha?! I... I am sorry. If you're truly sorry, then bring me the head of the real one. Bring Yukimura's head here to me. Either do that, or begone! My Lord Shogun. At the battle of Sekigahara... ...you took my hand and said that I was your savior. Please remember your words, and... Shut up! You dare to claim that a lowly ninja saved me, the almighty Shogun? Get this lunatic out of my sight! Yes sir. Great Shogun, please forgive me! Great Shogun, please forgive me! Lord Todo has defeated Kimura Nagato's army at waka'e'zutsumi. He has taken Nagato's head. Announcement: Lord Goto has died in battle. Goto too? Goto too? Yes sir. M... Mother! Mother. This is the end of the ToyotomiClan. Please prepare yourself. No. You must not lose hope. As long as you remain alive, fate will turn in your favor one day. But if we stay here, there is no way we will survive. There is. Mother? Did you send Princess Sen? Indeed. I had no other way to save your life. She should be reaching the Shogun soon. Even the Shogun will listen to his own kin, his own grandchiId. You see? The cannons have stopped firing! He has agreed! The Shogun has agreed! Grandfather. I, Sen, beg you with my life. Oh! Father! The inner keep! My son! Mother! My Lord! My Lord! My Lord! My Lord! Daisuke... this is the end. Yes sir. Saizo... leave! I will not! You mustn't die! We must win the last battle, then we win the war. Why aren't you leaving? Do you wish to go down with us and the castle? Of course I don't wish that. And you, my Lord? Are you just going to let leyasu rule the nation? I cannot fight against fate. At least let me die honorably, as a warrior should. No! Even though I'm just a ninja... ...I burn to defeat leyasu, even if it takes me seven lifetimes. For such a man as you, Sanada Yukimura, to choose death is absurd! Why won't you try to recover from this, and do everything you possibly can? We can go to the AjiRiver, I have a boat there. We can take the inland sea, cross over to Shikoku, Satsuma... ...and even further to the Ryukyu Islands, even to Luzon. Lord, you must not die. Lord! My Lord! Quickly! Quickly! Osaka Castle fell on the eighth day of the fifth month. However, Yukimura's corpse was nowhere to be found. On the same day... ...a small boat, steered by Kirigakure Saizo, left the banks of the AjiRiver. It left stealthily... and there were no witnesses. The End
