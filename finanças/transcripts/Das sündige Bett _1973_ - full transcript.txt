(static sizzling) (soft music) (upbeat music) - Well, I imagine you have no complaints. - I guess it wasn't bad for a quickie, but sometimes a girl wants a little romance. - Oh, now all of a sudden it's a big deal. Okay, next time I'll get a couple a dozen roses and hire a gypsy orchestra. - You don't understand. In the old days a woman was revered. There was elegance. The charmed and witted gentlemen lured the lady to his bed. Now it's strip and screw, and that mattress has no elegance. I will not have a handful of springs up my bottom anymore. You always take me to the best restaurants. Well in sex it's just as important to get the best setting. A bed, a bed you'll see, it'll work miracles. (laughing) - Sure only we put a lot of miles on this mattress with pretty good results. - A beautiful picture deserves a beautiful frame. I see myself sinking deep into a bed of feathers at the instant of pleasure. Sailing away on a big cloud. We get a bed? - No. - Then I won't do it anymore. - Now you listen, about this bed, the only people who buy beds aren't making it too good. (hums in agreement) What, you trying to make me think something's wrong with the way I ball you? - I gotta thing about a big bed. It's crazy I guess, but only without it I won't do it. - You mean if I don't buy you a-- - [Girl] No more fun and games until we get a nice big, sexy bed. - Okay. - A bed, we're getting a bed. Come on we're buying a bed. You'll ball me on a real bed. (laughing) A bed. Wait that's an antique shop. - Look if we're going to have a bed, we'll have a real one with some character, not some plastic junk. - Right. Hey we'll get a bed with a long noble history, and a distinguished mattress. A bed where generations of lovers have had their happiest moments. Think of it, we'll all be together on that marvelous bed. - [Man] Anybody here? - Over there. A bed please. - We had one, only it fell apart when we tried a rather athletic position. Anyway we've got to have a bed by tonight. - It's urgent. - Just about everybody who comes in wants a bed. How'd you like to buy some glasses? - Are you outta your mind. He who sleeps on glasses sleeps alone. (laughing) - The beds are in there. You can't miss them. - Thanks. - Come on. This place is fantastic. Like going back in time. - Let's try over there. - [Girl] Here is some, oh they're all single beds. Who needs that? - [Boy] Yeah who wants to sleep alone? - [Bed] Well a couple of customers. Oh, youngsters. They won't be interested in an old relic like me. At my age I'm ready for the junk pile, that's what they'll say. - There's more over there. I don't see any good ones. - Neither do I. - [Girl] Let's take a look. - [Bed] Generations of loyal service, and now, cast aside, forgotten. Hey you two. Look me over. Bounce on me. Over here. Look at me. Solid as a brick house. I could tell you stories. And what stories, of battle and conquest. Beautiful ladies. Fallen on my field of honor. - George look. Close your eyes. When you open them you'll see our bed. - Where? - There. - Oh. - How about that? And just look how big and roomy it is. - Great yeah I'm happy it comes up to your expectations. I hope I can come up with what it costs. - A bed like this needs a real home. Most new bedrooms are so little. It isn't easy, you can't fit a bed like this into a corner. No you've gotta respect a bed like this. Now what do you say? - How much does it cost? - 400. Plus delivery. - 400, you must be crazy. For this fugitive from the city dump? 400 for this relic? - Oh if you like, we'll get rid of it for you mister, and it won't cost you a thing. - [Girl] Sure is it a deal? - Sorry, but that's rock bottom. (playful music) (laughing) - Well now we're a trio. You, me, and the bed. - Look, everyone's admiring our bed. - Hey this is where it's all happening. - [Bed] These wonderful children spent every cent they had on me. Ah, that's something I'll never forget. Push my friends, push. Tonight you will rest as never before. (laughing) - Hey wait. - What are you doing? - We must launch and christen our bed just like a ship. - I don't know what to call it. Sand man, how's that? - Oh no, that's silly. Softly, that's what I'll christen him. May you sail out onto oceans of passion and pleasure, that pass by the icebergs of anger. Don't you ever sail in waters of indifference. - And bed no matter how rough, you mustn't sink into a storm of sex. Ship don't give up. (laughing) - Hey, let's compare their beds. Come on. Come on! - Yeah okay. - [Bed] It's certainly true. Truth is stranger than fiction. On the very day that I am rescued from that mausoleum and set on a new career, here I am right back where I started. Yes that's the store where I was first sold, way back in 1908. Oh those good old days. Then people had time for living. Courtship and conquest were a game, effected to an art. - I think it's remarkable. A Japanese at the Cafe Apollo. How international we're becoming. - Shall we meet tonight? - No tonight I dine with my fiance. - Romance? - No, business. Their fortune for my title. - Marriage is it? - Not quite yet. First a financial arrangement, then we'll see. Now excuse me I am awaited. (bell chiming) I go into battle. - And you'll be victorious. - No please don't make another scene. Von Verdenfelts is a very fine gentlemen from the tip of his mustache down to his toes. I'm able to bring a genuine aristocrat into our family and what's her reaction, hopeless. - Don't be angry with her Tristan. - Here is Von Verdenfelts. - [Lady] Underneath she's still a clutz. - He's quite ghastly, if he kissed me I should faint. - In that case you'd better close your eyes and think of something else. - Ah there you are, good day to you sir. - I had thought you had already arrived. - I propose we look at beds straight away. Now come along, we shall pick a bed that is sure to guarantee success. - Oh thank you. - A truly solemn occasion, the choosing of a nuptial bed. - Truly an extraordinary bed. The quality and the workmanship attain a rare degree of perfection. I think I may say, it's a piece that any man would like to possess. I think, it's the most beautiful one that I have ever seen. You may look high and low and find no better, and I would guarantee your complete satisfaction. Can one ask more of a bed? - [Bed] I was young and inexperienced. Oh let's be honest, I was a virgin, and so was poor Iris. The thought of that pompous tin soldier, Lieutenant Von Verdenfelds inaugurating us sent shivers up and down my springs. The young salesman seemed an infinitely better candidate, and I could tell that Iris felt the same way. My slats were a quiver with anticipation. Here was one bed that wasn't going to lie down on the job. - All right, enough of these fancy words. They're probably all true but I am interested in whether it pleases Iris? - As to pleasing the young lady, you have my guarantee of that. For her this bed will be a frame for masterpieces. - Never mind the honeyed words. My daughter is taken. She's about to marry Lieutenant Von Verdenfelds. You're wasting your time my lad, now come along I'll pay whatever you ask. - Yes sir. - [Tristan] I'm waiting my young friend, let's settle the bill. - Why am I marrying the daughter? It's her mother I desire. - Tonight Alfred has a reunion with his old colleagues. - There we are, it's all arranged. I would be delighted to ask you to dinner tonight, but I can't. I'm meeting some old colleagues. Yes a nobleman in my family. How's that for moving up in the world. - I know all about those soldiers. - I'll bet you do. I'm right as a river. - That's all right, the silly gold break, that awful cold sore. (laughing) Always so stiff except where it counts. - The nation's future is in the Army's hands. The Army is the only way to progress. - Oh yes go on. When you speak of politics, it excites me so, there's no telling what I'd do. You must go on. - The anarchists that band of agitators. The Army will teach them a lesson. - Oh go on. - Its patriotism and its blind obedience, which harbor breasts nourishing the fatherland. - Well said. (playful music) (giggling) - Taking time out. If you're not busy you could find-- - I am busy. - If your client is gone... - He's gone below. - What's that? The young lady dropped her broach. - Yes sir. Sorry sir. - Natural mistake. Now what is this about your clients? Is it true you have people waiting for you? They come in do they when I'm gone. - What is this tone? If you're not happy go home to your wife and question her. - Ha, with all this politics my head is swimming. - I feel inspired. We mustn't waste a single moment. - Well I mean my daughter, any second she might come in. Oh what are you doing? - She would never barge into her mother's bedroom. You brought the girl up well disciplined. - Oh you say the nicest things. I don't know how I shall resist you. My husband doesn't know anything of tenderness. But you... (gasping) - We're closing. - It's a glorious bed. - Yes, it's the best there is. - You think that Von Velderfelts is the right individual to initiate me on a bed like this? - Well you're marrying that individual. - That's no answer. You find it shocking that I wish to speak of such an intimate subject? - You can of course, only it's one subject... I must close up now, it's very late. - But a little while ago, when we looked at each other from all that I could gather you were interested. - Yes well, I was I admit. - Since it's my own bed, I'll try it out. - Yes only I'm afraid that we're closing. - Nevertheless Father's paid for it, I own it. - Miss where are you going? - To get undressed. I don't wear anything to bed. (giggling) - I don't know what to say? - Then don't say anything. - Oh good Lord. (romantic music) You're enchanting. - You really think so? - Yes I mean it. - I like you too. - That's splendid. - Well I'm waiting. You undress. - I'm new at this. - Well let's not worry. Everybody says it's easy. Now we'll find out. - Giddy up horsey, giddy up. Go ahead horsey, faster. Little faster, I've got a horse. (laughing) Wait, wait. Attention. Present arms. Right shoulder arms. Now stand at ease. A soldier who wants to stay at attention. Who's eager to get to the front. What regiment is he in? Heavy artillery. (clock chiming) Well, ready, aim, fire. Oh gGorge, I think I'm going outta my head to give my daughter a guy, like this. (romantic music) (gasping breaths) (soft moaning) (heavy breathing) - A bed that is fit for a king. I got a real nobleman for my little girl and I didn't mind paying for it. - If you're equally generous with me, you won't refuse to give me a big present. - How'd you like to go by and take a look at that bed? - I wouldn't mind. Only my time is money. (romantic music) (gasping moans) (uptempo music) (cries of ecstasy) - [Peter] My Father always said I should satisfy the customers. - I'm perfectly a satisfied customer. Now what will your father say? - My dear old dad would say, "My son the reputation of the firm "rests in your capabilities." - Your capabilities rest on you being firm I would say. - Oh listen, when you've seen one bed, you've seen them all. - Ah there it is in there. What idiot drew the curtains. - It's not worth it. - Oh yes it is, you just wait. You're in for a surprise. Come on I'll boost you up. I'll lift you up. (romantic music) Wasn't it worth it? - Oh yes, you told I'd be surprised. - [Tristan] What's your opinion? - I believe I rarely seen a bed used so well. - What's that? What do you see? - I shall try to describe just what I see. Two young lovers are upon the bed. - They're just dummies. - No, no they're wriggling. - [Tristan] They're wriggling on my bed? - Oh boy are they balling. - They're balling? You're teasing, they can't be balling. - On my goodness. I never imagined it'd be fun in that position. Oh my he's quite a stud. - In the bed of my daughter. Outrageous. How are they doing now? - Oh it's absolutely fascinating. I never saw a bed bounce like that. Higher I can't see anything. - Peter, there's somebody watching us at the window. - Good Lord. - He's making love to her. Higher, higher. - Maybe it's a night watchman. - [Female] Oh quickly let me down, they're coming. - So they're coming. - We're not putting on a free show. - Well hello there. - Papa? (groaning) (dramatic music) - [Tristan] Iris. Iris, come here this instant. - [Female] No, she was doing very well. - What's the meaning of this? I never would have imagined my daughter would betray me before my very eyes. - [Bed] My first scandal. This double deflowering I shall always cherish. The poor father was apoplectic with rage. The two lovers remained motionless in the face of the storm. I had carried them to a distant planet where his anger could not penetrate. - [Tristan] And what have you to say for yourself you miserable cur. - I would like to-- - You already have. - Request your daughters hand of marriage. - [Tristan] Her hand, when you've had all the rest. - Help, help, this man is assaulting me. He even pinched my derriere. (gasping) - Good God. That was all-- - Sorry sir, we're closed. - It's Iris. Sir I fail to understand. Very strange all this. - Just a minor misunderstanding. I'll explain everything. - [Bed] As luck would have it, this chance encounter of the Lieutenant, the father, the daughter, and the young salesman, all gathered here around me, was to have a profound influence on all their lives. And on mine too. - Under the circumstances I'm obliged to inform you that the engagement is now broken. - But what about her dowry? - Dowry? I shall keep your paltry sum as partial indebtedly for my honor. - Your honor. - Come I shall befriend you. I can hardly leave such a charming lady in this inequity. - Just a moment, one moment to attend to. - Please go ahead. (gentle music) - Yes? - Goodbye. - May I? - So much trouble I went to trying to get my daughter a husband. - [Iris] But you don't have to get me a husband, Papa. - And why not? - Because I've got one. Peter Hadrick. - Hadrick? The furniture people? Two large stores? - The son. - Only son. (chuckling) - Then you'll inherit the whole pearl. - [Bed] And that's how Iris and I lost our innocence and her papa became a grandfather. And as the story books say, we lived happily ever after, all except me. (laughing) - Over here, come on. (both coaxing bed out together) (speaking foreign language) - [Bed] Whoa, slow down my friends. Not so fast. - I can't wait. - I can't either. Hey let's stop a minute huh. - Hey you, move it up a little will you. - Right away sir. - Driver, please advance. - Yes milady, at your order. Motor may station vehicles only where they will not be a hindrance to other motorists or pedestrians. I quote paragraph 10 of the motor vehicle code. - Does the code say anything about kissing? - [Bed] These two lovebirds bring back memories. Oh the kisses I've been witness to. There isn't much in the art of love that I haven't seen. I remember what happened when I left Iris and her husband after being a member of their family for so many years. Times changed, and I found myself in service quite different from the quiet family life I had known. (speaking foreign language) (piano music) (cheering) (clapping) - Really fantastic, really put together. - [Man] There she is. Lucy you were sensational. - Really superb Lucy. You've got a way of really putting over a song that can't be topped. - [Man] That you do. - All that counts in life is being happy. Champagne here, Rene. (merry music) - You're making a mistake coming to a place like this, I warn you. You won't like the things you see. You'll be shocked. - Maybe it's true but I wanna see what it is that makes my husband come here. - There's only one reason he'd come to this place, but you know that already. It's true the ladies here do a good job. - A good job. - You name it. Over the years there is nothing I haven't seen here. You've been here very long? - Too damn long I'd say, but now there's no way out for me. Me with a husband in jail and three good for nothing kids that can't find work. Times are hard, and I'm too old now to find another job so I stay here. It turns my stomach some nights. It was another dead one last night. - Really? - Oh he was really dead all right, and you think anybody around here cared? - I think you're exaggerating. - [Lady] I think you've got too much imagination. - [Maid] This place is like quick sand. The more you try to get out the deeper you sink. - Thanks for the warning. Where's the singers dressing room? - Go straight down the corridor next to the garbage cans. (laughing) - And you want to do it together? - Yeah that's right. - But up on the stage on the bed. - Oh, do the naughty bed? - You bet. - Well I don't say no, and I don't say yes. (mumbling) - If it works out, what do you say to Florence? - Ran into an old friend. - I hope she won't ask. - If she does I'll introduce you. (laughing) - What are you doing in here? - I have a business transaction to discuss. - [Lucy} What kind of business? - Replacing you on the stage tonight. - Are you sure that's what you'd like. - Yes, especially when the client who bought champagne is involved. - Charles Burnbank. (laughing) He isn't much to get excited about. - I'm quite aware of that, we've been married long enough. Over eight years. - I don't like getting involved in marital squabbles. - Please don't be angry, but be fair he pays you well. He can pay me too. - You would actually make him pay? - Why not, I do a good job. - Oh that's perverse. And besides there's somethings you ought to know. Don't believe it's easy to do a good job. First have you got what it takes? - Oh yes. Is this good enough for giving a good time to the clients? - You need nerve too. - You name it and I'll do it. - All right. (dramatic music) (gasping breathing) If you knew how I despised them. - They're waiting. - They can wait. (heavy breathing) (moaning) - Oh it was wonderful. - The one thing men lack is tenderness. - Women lack one thing as well. - Nobody's perfect. - I need a box. - I don't understand. - A box of safes. - A what? - Rubbers lady. - Well then you should've said so in the first place. You think I'm a mind reader? Here they'll cost you two dollars. - Isn't that kinda high? - Well that's right. - They're supposed to cost only 50 cents. - It's too much you say, well all right as a special offer you get this. - I'm not interested. - You intellectualist. - The money? - What do we do about the money? - I'll give you double the money that my husband does. - All right. If that's what you wish. - Everything is ready. The bed and me. Ready for first act. I leave it to decide which of you will begin. (laughing) - I'll go first, I mean, unless you'd rather? - Go right ahead. It's perfectly all right. - Good. - Well, the men are itching to go. Sure you can manage it? - What do you think? Am I all right? I wouldn't want him to be disappointed. - Don't worry about a thing. You'll do just fine. - What if I'm recognized? - You won't, it'll be quite dark. (shushing) If one of you gentlemen would like to begin. - Oh yes. In here? Oh Lucy. You're beautiful. (moaning) (gasping) (playful music) Oh Lucy. Oh Lucy. (heavy breathing) (gasping) Oh Lucy, Lucy. Oh man oh man. That was something. - You really got your moneys worth eh? - She's a lot like my wife. Naturally she's much better. Oh my God this stuff. Why don't you go in and get the real thing. Go on, don't keep the lady waiting. Go on. - Yes. (happy moaning) Lucy? Lucy? (heavy breathing) (moaning) (merry music) - [Bed] Apparently the lady failed to notice, that although the second dance was like the first, her partner had changed. - Well, was it good? - Lucy but, who's in the bed then? - Come I'll show you who it is. - I don't understand. I thought you were in bed with me. - Come along, you will see. - [Charles] Oh if it's not you, who the hell is it? - Sit down. (merry music) - [Charles] My God, Florence. - Well did we surprise you? - Really I mean. - We call this little number turn about is fair play, or what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is no pint introducing you. You know each other. - It's a scandal, I protest. (laughing) - What's so terrible really I ask you. Your wife and best friend are in bed together. Now what is wrong in that? It's the sort of thing that friends outta do for one another. - A woman of your kind could never understand. - [Man] See here you can't speak to Lucy like that. - [Bed] A very nasty scene ensued, and marked the end of my theatrical career. Too bad, I might have played Cleopatra's barge. But no. I was destined for better things. - Can you tell me how to get to the post office? - The post office? - Yes. - Nothing easier. If you please sir. After you. - Oh thank you. - There we are. - Hey sonny, you got a bed there, not a taxi. - Don't be ridiculous. If this were a bed it wouldn't be waiting at a taxi stand. Why I'm going to be traveling in real style today. Driver if you're ready. - Yes sir. - Here we go. (laughing) (upbeat music) Well here we are. I hope you enjoyed your ride. - Yes indeed. - At your service. - What do I owe you? - Oh you've nothing to pay. - If you're satisfied that's enough. - Meeting you two has made my whole day. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - So long. - A rolling bed is something customers notice. I don't have one. Only if I could use yours it might help business. - No I don't think a rolling bed would work. - You gotta use whatever you can, when you're selling stale merchandise. - But you're not stale merchandise. - I may not have been once, but I've been on the market too long. (laughing) - [Bed] You see life is just a series of coincidences. Meeting Eva today like this. I knew her a long time ago. And you should have seen her then. Ah Eva. The little queen bee in her hive as fiery as her morning coffee. There was also Carla. Miss Curlers they called her. And Alure, who bathed little but powdered much. Geida, the tigress with steel claws. And the guiding spirit of the house, the Valkyrie of prostitution, The Madam. And last but not least, the faithful witness and chronicler of a million intimacies, your humble servant, or in this case an undercover agent so to speak. While Madam Schindler's house was a veritable secret service. One day... - Allow me to present Mister, what was your name again? - Uldaman. - Mister Uldaman and I would like to be alone. - The girls may stay. Unlike you I have no secrets Madam. - Haven't you? - Ladies and Madam, we are well aware of what goes on here. - We're world famous. Everyone knows that. - Don't talk back. We have been patient with you, but now. - But now the furor wants us in case the enemy makes a frontal attack. - The furor doesn't find that funny. If you do not cooperate, these ladies will-- - What? - Will-- - Yes? - [Schindler] They will be redeployed. - They're gonna put us in a battalion. Whores for Hitler. And our mission is keeping the Air force up. - [Schindler] We are also aware of the sensitivity of your area. Diplomats come here and go. - Ah you are intelligent. - As of now you are working for us Madam. I am putting in listening equipment. They can all whisper, but I will be listening. (phone ringing) Operation Redlight. (speaking foreign language) Yeah, everything is ready. Yeah we will soon get results. I'm certain. The furor will congratulate us on this. Yeah I'll stay here. Yeah. We'll get the Iron Cross for this one. (laughing) (gasping) (moaning) (playful music) - You're a handsome guy. - Oh the gentleman's glass is empty. That isn't very nice. Don't do that again. - Wouldn't you like to join the party? - Now you know I never do that. Look at all these charming girls. - But you're the most beautiful girl here. - I'm very flattered. You diplomats know how to talk to women. My days past but my girls know all my secrets. - [Man] Century at 54.2. Domestic 56.2. Gas industries-- - [Woman] Do you have to read the paper? - [Man] Well the stock market is going up and down erratically. - So are you. Oh boy. There. Let's really go. - Go where? - All the way. - Oh these English men. (gasping) Come on. - Yes it's rising several points. - [Eva] I'll settle for just one point. - [Man] Oh I say. I say I believe I might just manage it. - Good show. - I say, I say. - [Eva] You say what? - I say, tally ho! Oh damn. - He who laughs last laughs best. - All right then. - You liked it? - Might I have a cup of tea? (moaning) (heavy breathing) - She likes it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. - You won't learn any military secrets here. - So I tell her husband I caught a spy. - Good evening darling, how nice to see you here tonight. My dear, you have a long night ahead. Basillio the hot blooded Spanish gentleman's joining us tonight. I want you to take good care of him. All right he'll be here in an hour. - [Eva] But why always me? - Boring, always the same thing. (gasping breathing) (moaning) - You're beautiful. The German girls. Fantastic. Oh again, again. Ready yes. I've never had it so good. Oh shit. So pretty. Beauty. Oh it's good. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh you're beautiful. - My dear friend how nice of you to visit us. It's always such a pleasure to welcome you here. As always you'll have me little Eva. - Like always. For you, little Eva. (soft music) - You're orders are to be issued. Everyone here will be affected. They concern a matter close to the heart of our furor. Should I tell you about them? - Oh yes, please. (whistling) - We will clean house. We shall remove from the fatherland all except the master race. The Aryan is the only true German. - What's an Aryan? - One with highest moral fiber. Pure in mind and body. - Hail, Hitler. (playful flute music) - We shall create a new race in the world. We'll create a race of true Nordics. Blonde hair, blue eyes. Beautiful legs. All of use are master race. Far superior, more intelligent, and ready to take our civilization in hand. - Thank you for the warning. Our secret service is indebted to you Madam. - What is it Uldaman. - Let me in there. - Oh no. I'm afraid you can't. - There's a secret agent. - So, all the more reason to keep him secret. - I have to get in. Open the door. - Who's that? - We're being spied on. There's the microphone see. - Who planted the microphone? - Well rumor has it you did. You outsmarted yourself. - Open at once. - They were only obeying your orders master. - There you are. - Where is the spy? (exciting music) You idiot, what are you doing here? - Sir I couldn't. - Get out of here. - I assure you. - Get out. - No, no, no, no everyone don't stand here. Go to your rooms please. - You haven't got the brains of a pig. You are a pig. You will be punished for this. If any microphones are to be installed I'm the one who will decide. - I thought-- - Thinking is something you must never do. The furor does our thinking for us. And the furor my friend, doesn't need your help. - Only this place is a very sensitive area. - That is evident. And if you think I need any of your information you're mistaken. I suppose you think I'm here to enjoy myself? - Oh that's the very last thing I'd have thought. - There are some secrets that no one must hear. Do I make myself clear? - Hail Hitler. (speaking foreign language) Hail Hitler. - Hail my ass. Excuse me but he did insist. - It's all right. Hail Hitler. - Don't you want your shoes? (playful music) - [George] Think they'll be any room? - We'll never get it in. - [George] I should have reserved seats. I told you so. - Chivalry is dead. Hey what's the difference between an old bed and a young man? - I don't know. - In a young man hope springs eternal, in an old bed springs are internal. - And are the springs a young man's fancy? - I don't think that's the springs they're talking about. - Oh that's what you think. I'll show you. - How about Paris on the springs? - Spring like the tiger. - Down tiger, take it easy. We're almost home now. - Okay. (laughing) - [Bed] Too bad. I thought the occasion was about to spring up. It would've been my first time in the open air. Not to be. The fickle finger of fate. - What about this place? - I'm exhausted, by the time we get home. I don't think I'll have any energy left. - Do you mean it? - If you want, this is a moment. - Right. Emergency. The first rule, strike while the iron's hot. - And is the iron hot? - You'll find out. (romantic music) (heavy breathing) - [Bed] Here my friends. Here I am. Ready, willing, and able, and all alone. Oh well, memories. I knew this building when it wasn't a pile of rubble. Though in a way the whole country had fallen to bits. In those days doing my job was no bed of roses. - [Woman] Well here comes our hero of the home front. - He's got everything he owns stored away, nice and safe. His wife is in Switzerland. Very handy being in the party. - As far as I'm concerned, he's a bastard. Who else would bring down this bed down to the cellar? Hey what's the latest on when we're going to win the war? - I don't consider that a laughing matter. - In the party you don't laugh much. - You better watch your step madam. - Hail Hitler. - Forget it. - [Bed] Yes, it was the beginning of the end for the Nazis. Though I didn't like that disagreeable individual. I suppose it is thanks to him that I survived in a safe place. (muffled chatter) - Get that bed outta here. Our troops are living in trenches and you make the bomb shelter into a bordello. - Is that right? If they gave the Iron Cross to loudmouths I would recommend you to the furor. (low drum booming) - For once why don't they go and bomb Nuremberg. - Yeah and what do you think the people over there are saying right now? - [Maria] It's too quiet. I'm worried. - When the bombing starts you can begin worrying. - I hate these raids. No one knows when the next one will come. Just between us I'd rather not know. - I just can't sit here. - Maria. - No it's Gisella. - Sorry. - You were dreaming. - What about your husband, any news? - He's getting transferred to the front. His whole unit is going. - Would you like to sit down? (distant rumbling) Scared? - Yes. - Me too. - It's getting farther away I think. - It isn't over yet. - Sit here awaiting the next bomb. - Hoping it's the last. - I'm fed up with this crying. I must ask you to keep your children under control. You are all responsible for your children. Teach them discipline and loyalty to our furor. - Listen, would it hinder the war effort irrefutably if you went and sat down? - Some of us still might like to serve the country. - A splendid idea. You should be up at the front. Perhaps he'll disappear if we ignore him. (knocking) - What was that? - Since you're our protector, why don't you go and inspect. (crying) It's very likely a detailed Russian officer, I'm wondering could you tell us where Hitler lives. Now don't worry, all those bombs will go away soon. It's Singer. - Have you got a pass? - Misses Singer. - Oh Mister Singer. - Gisella, Carl's here. - Carl? - Yes dear he just came in. - I'm so happy for you. - I must see your pass. - Oh come on relax. Martha how are you? - Regulations state that you must have an official pass other wise you're under arrest. - Oh can't somebody shut his mouth for Pete's sake? I don't wanna hit him. - Now listen here hero, you are going to sit down and shut up. You understand? Now you just meditate about your precious furor. - Carl, how in the world did you get here? - They gave us a two hour leave. I'm sorry I have to get back to my unit by midnight. - Weren't you out in the middle of all that bombing? - Oh there's nothing going on there. They're flying off to the west. Oh God you look great. (laughing) Tell me, are you all right? - Here's to you Carl. - Thanks. - Here, here's a little something for you. Take this, good. - What is it? - Imitation sausage. - Hello stranger. - Oh hello Hans. - I've been saving this Carl. Come on let's drink it. - Everybody fill your glasses. If ever there was an occasion to get plastered, this is it. (laughing) (muffled chatter) All the best to you Carl. - 'Til midnight. - All the best. - Thanks. - You'll be cozier in there. - In there? - [Bed] You can call me sentimental, but that night I did everything I could to make those two lovers happy. They had only a couple of hours and I vowed they would be hours that neither would never forget. - I'll see that you're not disturbed. (laughing) - I'll tell you if my husband came back just for one night like Carl here, I'd hide his trousers and he'd never go back. Hey where's our hero? Don't sulk over there all by yourself. Even if he's a Nazi he should join our party too. Come on now. - I'm sorry but I get very nervous. - Oh we're all feeling the same. (merry music) - Two hours. - When will you be home? - Tonight's all that matters. (breathy moaning) (upbeat music) (breathy moaning) (ragged breathing) - How much I love you. - That's something they can't take away from us. - No. (upbeat music) - Of all my treasures Princess, you may choose one upon your knees. Your master will be generous. Now Princess, make your choice. - You have captured all of me already by giving me not emeralds or diamonds, but by giving me the answer to a maidens prayer. The princes of ancient China could never give me what you have. This rare and delicate bed. I am most fortunate of all women. There is but one thing. - What is it? - A mattress. - Is that all. Your wish shall be granted. What about this one? - I can hardly wait to sleep on it. - You will get a demonstration of things you can do on it. (laughing) There's a legend about this mattress. Who sleeps upon it alone in the light of the full moon shall be haunted by the spirits of maiden Oz. - [Bed] Well, well a new mattress. New to the three of us anyway. And for free. I've known some who let their budgets run away with them. Always in debt to pay for some fancy new gadget. That high standard of living can kill you. - I'm back, hello. More overtime again. Next time he'll have me typing with my feet as well. Millions he's going to get. All big deals. And when I ask for a raise, he says he's headed for the poor house, I don't know. - Wait 'til you taste this. Made with champagne and partridge eggs. It's a recipe I thought up myself. I think it's okay. Tell me honestly what you think. - More stew. - Not bad is it? Look it's Hyrulian Monastery. Only the best battery acid. - Darling this beer, shouldn't it be a little bit colder? If we got a refrigerator maybe it would be cold. - Well surely it's far more important to get furniture. - All of our friends have got plenty of furniture. Why not us? - Oh don't worry, I told you everything will come. Anyway, we're happy aren't we? - Oh I guess so. I'm just tired of poverty. We can't go on like this. - Something will turn up all right. (gentle music) - Just an intimate party for someone. - His wife too? - For her it's all going to be very easy. She's as stupid as she is ugly. - Tell me have you any idea-- - He betrays her, she betrays him, and that's all that should be needed. Then you and I will collect the fortune. - You don't think that if we waited a little longer-- - If ever it was the right instant to invest it's now. And if we're successful with our plan, considering the location of the property, we'll probably realize over a 400% profit margin. - You're a business genius. - Does that make up for the fact that I'm not so competent when it comes to marriage darling? To us. - When are you going to get smart. This town's full of rich widows looking for guys like you. They reek of big money. Money all ripe for plucking. - Yeah so? Why don't you pick up some of that dough? I'm telling you you're just what they want. Gold nuggets, pick 'em up, it's a pleasure. - Yeah but for whom? - All right, what do you care. Don't waste your chances of getting it where it's at. - Hello? Any one here? - Well go ahead, this is your golden opportunity. - Yeah. May I help you? Please come in. - Lots of luck. - Your director if you please. - [Stefan] I'm so sorry, he isn't here. - Then I'll wait. - There's no telling when he'll get back. It could be quite awhile. - Do you make a commission? When you sell one of those cars? - Yes. - Get one for me. - [Stefan] Yes certainly. - May we give it a test? - Yes of course. - Two Golden Crest. That's my address. - It's a pity but I'm afraid I haven't got a great deal of time. I'm dining early tonight. A very important official. Oh the official can wait. (sultry music) Now let's get to serious things. - Whatever you'd like. - You're sweet. Perhaps we can now begin our preliminaries. The first preliminary will be a shower. - Yeah. (phone ringing) - Hello. Right now? - [Bed] My new mistress was not in the first blush of youth, but she made me blush all the same. Mixing business with pleasure, her assets remained intact. She had a good head for figures. And young men like Stefan she considered a good investment. - It's not extortion, it's just gentle persuasion. It's very simple, you just do it Senator. Look I'm terribly sorry, you'll have to be more insistent. The president has to understand my position. He's an intelligent man. That's the idea. Maybe I'll invite you. I'm entertaining a young man. He's superb only he's bashful. I hope that he has. Tomorrow? Sure. What did you say? Monday, maybe I'd better call you back. - [Bed] As far as she was concerned, Stefan's stock was rising to a new high. (throaty moaning) (heavy breathing) - That the going rate? - It's more. (laughing) - I don't want it. - What then? - This. - What? - The bed here. - The bed? - The bed. - The bed? - Yeah. (discordant piano music) - Where'd you get that? - It's only a beginning, it's gonna be a real showplace here. - [Bed] At first it was a bit lonely here. Four walls, the rug, the chandelier, and me. And then an armchair, another one, then a chest of drawers and on and on they came until I felt like a king holding court. Add two lovers and presto, I was ready to work my own magic. At last they were both happy. - For the next hour or so I don't want to be disturbed. - I quite understand sir. (low jazzy music) - Well what a nice surprise. Can I ask you an indiscreet question? You don't strike me as the sort of girl who-- - Just lucky I guess. Let's say I'm a wicked woman, okay? That's what I always tell the gentlemen, I might suggest the ones who telephone a call girl are really the immoral ones, however let it go. - You must admit a man doesn't expect a girl-- - A girl like me? - That's right. - I found that men are often put off by a woman they consider to be a lady. I wonder why? But one woman is like another they say. Should we get started? I'd like to get home before my husband does, otherwise it's a big deal. I hate lying to him. - Married? What the hell is this? - I love my husband in fact. - Then what the hell are you doing in my room? - Because I love him. Drop it okay? You'll never understand. Anyway who cares? You don't wanna talk. There's much better things to do. (laughing) - [Man] Who cares. - [Misses Ollie] Yes? - Misses Ollie? - [Misses Ollie] Yes. - There's your fridge. (laughing) - Who sent it - Oh my darling who cares? Maybe you won a beauty contest. (upbeat music) - Like a drink? - Yes. Where is our beautiful guest? She's late. - She's here. She's in the shower. - I'm looking forward to meeting her. - Here we are. Do hurry up. - Well, competition? - Don't worry. - Where is he your Adonis? - In the shower. - Sounds absolutely-- - Would you like to see the new we got, it's in the bedroom. - Oh yes, certainly. - Now's our chance, let's go. It's upstairs. - Hey you, hey you. You mind sharing the soap? - Just a second. - Wait a minute. No. What are you doing here? - Tony! - Yeah. - What are you doing... - You're not... - The bed. - The refrigerator. (shouting at once) - No listen, I love you, that's why I did it. - Oh baby, it was to show you how much I love you that I did it. - I wanted you to have everything understand? - I understand everything. - You do understand. (upbeat piano music) Let's forget the whole thing. - The whole thing. We'll consider it didn't happen. The whole thing is dead and buried. - [Tony] Yes. - You must excuse me, I'm going home with my husband. - There's a place we have to go. - For instance? - Yes, for instance. - We're going to bed. - As the old saying goes, early to bed, early to rise. And the earlier the rise the better we're going to like it. Come on let's go to bed. (moaning) (heavy breathing) - Why'd you put the lights on darling? - Well you're a beautiful sight. - You're too much, you know that? Come. - [Tony] Yes. (gentle music) (moaning and heavy breathing) - How is it darling? What were those other women like, hmm? - [Tony] Fantastic. - Liar! - [Tony] What about those other men? - [Misses Ollie] Fantastic. - [Tony] Liar. (laughing) What is it? - [Misses Ollie] I wanna look at you. (moaning and heavy breathing) - [Bed] So their story came to a perfect end. As all love stories should. What are these kids up to now? Help. - Pull it's attached! - Okay. (upbeat music) There, watch out for the tree. All right? - Yeah I think so. - Young man, now look here. - Yes? - That you have a little girlfriend is normal for one your age, but when you start turning this house into a cat house then you're going too far. - Oh come on, is it really as bad as that? I bet you brought yours in just like this. - No it's not the same thing, this bed is old, I'm certain it's been used by who knows how many people. Such a bed gives you wicked ideas, I won't have it in my building and that's final! - The bed's got to go, it'll corrupt the neighbors. (gentle music) - Well. There's a housing shortage, only that's no reason to create a disturbance in a public place. I make my rounds every month, you'd better be gone when I get back. (gentle music) (moaning and heavy breathing) (motors revving) (laughing) - Far out. - Come on, fuck off will ya? - [Woman] Yeah, you're hanging us up. - That's a heck of a boner friend. (gentle music) - [Bed] And here's a happy ending if ever there was one. Next time, I'll bet they put me in... No, better not tell. If there's one thing I am, it's discreet. (upbeat music)
