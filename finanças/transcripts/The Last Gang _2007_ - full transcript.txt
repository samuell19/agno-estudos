To understand needs love and they loved Belleville like crazy. The Belleville of Jews and Arabs, of protest marches and grimy back streets. - That one looks good. - No, that one. The Chinaman wants the fattest one. The parkie! He knows my Mom! You jerk! He doesn't scare me. Tough kids led by the toughest of all. He was the first to do everything. After detention center, MASKED MOBSTERS he served a stretch in prison, which gave him a brother, Casa, and a conviction that life was for living with neither lord, nor master. But Belleville belonged to the Perez brothers. Nothing happened without their blessing. So these kids who'd never touched a gun called in a pro, a real pro, Landais, a headcase who'd been in the Legion. Sometimes, to be left in peace, you mustn't be scared of war. And that's when it all began... Next time, we steal a car with keys in it. Let's do one right now. No way. - We scout one out... - That one! - We gotta scout it out! - Park it up! I'll call the police. Run! - I told you, scout it out! - You can't even open a door! That's why. I never saw doors like that. What do we look like? - I'm going home. - No, we do this now. That one looks good. Hands up! Hand over the money! Where's the safe? Shut it up! Shut the dog up! I'll take care of it. Get the gun off me. Tell it to be quiet. What the hell are you doing? Move! Give me the bag! - Move it! - Here! Keep your hands up! Let's split! Faster! Put your foot down! Did I do good! Go left! Shut the fuck up! - Watch out! - Let me drive. Did I do good! Give me the bags. Give me the fucking bags! There's one missing. Shit! - Pipe down! - You can't even collect the bags. Can it, Scarface! You nearly nixed a poodle! - What'll the papers say? - Calm him down. That we're amateurs! Casa, pull over. Keep the engine running. Move it! Well then? You two are just animals! - If you'd said, I'd have come too. - Look! - Tomorrow, show your faces. - Keep your advice. - Let people see you acting normal. - We're not at school. Next time, don't point your gun at me. It's cool. Itpaysbetterthanworking. He says it pays better than working. You never saw so much! Perez'll be mad. - A hold-up on their territory. - Screw the Perez! Oh, Daniela! For you, life's just a game... Oh, Daniela! Don't go thinking... We were all after her and she chose you. I'm happy for you. That's enough of that. - Divide it up 6 ways. - Move over Led Zep! In a gang, the divvy... We're no gang, just a bunch of pals. Can't you see? I'll explain. The boys are like our suit of armor. They stop anyone seeing us. We do the banks, they do the rest. Anybody else'd rat on us right away. Do you wanna put it to a vote? Ma! Mrs. Toledano! 10 kids and not one to carry groceries? Who's that? Is he new? That's Landais, a pal of Simon's. Simon loves him. And he's a swell guy. - The cash? - Inthestove. Are you nuts? I hid my first wages there to keep from my Dad, and my Ma, who's never cold, sent it up in smoke. I was so mad! Don't go tempting fate. Everything okay, boys? Fine, Ma. We found ourselves some work, I think. Good, I hope so. Here, son. That's Samy the dealer. He had 30 cms of intestine taken out. We call him Sewer. He's cool but his breath's fatal. Okay, Bonner? - What's up, Simon? - How you doing? Hey, Casa, okay? Doing good? How you keeping? You need anything, just call me. Enjoy it, my friend. We can't take him, he's scared to death. He's gotta learn. So we all earn our share. - I'm not scared! - Keep cool. The manager's in on it. He's our accomplice on this. Is he nuts? Why'd he say that? Hands up higher! Watch the hostages! Hands up! The money! Watch her! C'mon, the cash in the bags! Faster! Keep your hands up! Get your hands higher! Let's split up. You take the Metro. Casa, look after Maxime. We're dead! Turn back! Shut up! It's nothing... Don't fall asleep. Stay with me. We've got to get rid of the car! Wake up! Don't fall asleep. If the cops get you, know what they'll do? Stop, that hurts! If they catch you wounded, you'll sell your mother. Understand? Ladies and gentlemen, due to technical problems... Sit down there. You'll be okay. Hang on in there! I'll be back. It's odd. Somebody broke into the storeroom. Call the police. Don't worry, Simon, we're here now. His legs! Bonner! Grab his legs! Let's go! Move it! Dad! Thanks. I'm relying on you to keep quiet. I told you not to take Maxime. Now, the cops are onto us. Good! New faces keep them in a job. No cops without crooks. You're dangerous to know! That why you wanted me to kill myself in the Metro? Cut it out! Landais did a great job. He saved your life. Okay, thank you. Thanks a lot. Don't act the wiseguy with Perez. They ain't gonna give us medals. What's up? Where is the little motherfucker? Look, there he is! Check this out. There they are! Haven't changed! Simon... I knew you in diapers, remember. Bonner, you watched my car. Maxime, you ran errands. And Merle... At school, his forged books beat my brother's real ones. Mr. Perez... This is Landais. He's new and damn good. The guy from Bayonne... And Casa, my brother. We met in jail. And this is Daniela Volpi. Her mother runs the deli. You know it? They're wondering how such an ugly beast landed such a beauty. C'mon, boys, it's open bar tonight. A bottle of whisky for my brother! Sonia, what's this bum doing here? Give him some food and get him out! He stinks! Go on, this way! How long did you do? 15 months? For a burglary? Wasn't too hard? Now, you're on my team. Really? How can you be sure? You have a great future if you're smart. How old were you when you beat that cop? 12? 13? I know what you felt. That rush. Like getting a teak hard-on. You never forget that. Find the guys who are pissing on my patch. Look, Mr. Perez... Call off the hunt for them. It's us. We're right here. We're not hurting your business. Banks aren't your game. - You should've told me. - What? That we were gonna rob banks? You'd have laughed in my face. Now, we've shown you, we've learned. We're not kids anymore. What's he doing? Now I see who I'm dealing with. There's a place for everyone, if everyone knows his place. Make me an offer. We already share 6 ways. Who d'you think you are? He gives you drinks not a bullet and you treat your Arab better. Know what you are? You're like his girl giving me the eye. - You're a whore ! - Shut up and sit down! Screw her! If you gave me her, I wouldn't take her. No one threatens me like that! What are you staring at? This ain't a movie. I told you to kick him out. Get outta here, this ain't some kind of dive. Cut it out, William. The pig slobbered on me! What are you doing? What's your game? Come here! Right, what do we do now? Don't fuck around, it's loaded. It's loaded? Go on then, shoot! - It really is loaded. - Shoot, you fucker. Cool it, he was joking. The gun's loaded! I had no idea you were joking. Hell of a sense of humor. Here, boss, a little gift. Get up. C'mon, get up. You've got no business here. Here, buy some soap and a suit. You stink. This isn't a charity. Go on, clear out. We're having fun. We gotta have fun. Cool it, Simon, calm down. 50-50, don't forget. You've got one week. Fuck you! Just try it. What was the deal with the bum? Shut up, it's cool. Everything's cool. That's for me. Roll up! Roll up! Just look at you. An embarrassment to the department. At 14, he was in an orphanage, but he's not an orphan. Why the big thing with Toledano? He float your boat? Not at all... He laughed at death, I was shit scared. - Time you took a break. - No, I have a reason to continue. Milan, you won't bring your Dad back. You know why he was in an orphanage? Don't know much, do you? Versine Orphanage The idiots! Here, you needed permission to breathe. So I learned to disobey. Charles isn't happy. He's waiting for his 50%. You talk the talk, but 4 guns against 40, you don't stand a chance. Even so, my brother has an offer for you. 200,000 in cash. One week. Double every day after that. 200,000? That's a lot of heists. What does the little Granny dog say? Excuse me... I'm the Granny. That's my dog. Sorry. Thank you. I'm coming. 200,000's fine by me, but check with Casa. He's the boss. Don't you get it? No Arabs! No, you don't get it. Let me tell you a story. In jail, a big man with a blackjack tries to fuck me over. I'm about to ice him and get 20 years when a guy grabs my arm, saves my life. And you won't talk to him? Think again. He keeps me calm. If not, you'd be choking on your balls. And don't touch me. If you won't talk to him, get out. Why do you keep looking at me? Am I the entertainment? I wasn't. You were. You keep staring at me. I feel like we already met someplace. Really? It must be your eyes or your scent. You know how to talk to a guy. I didn't mean that... Keep going, I love it. Seriously, maybe we have met. Do you come here often? - No, never. - Of course not. You're an uptown girl. I wanted to visit the pet store but I got there too late. I'm always late. I had some time to kill waiting for my friend, so... That's all. I wanted one like that. A Bichon to keep my mother's dog company. The poor thing's so sad since... It's a silly story... I'm boring you with poodles. No, I always dreamed of owning a poodle. But in my line of work, it's not easy. I have to go. I'll get it. You're kidding. Seriously. Thanks anyway. Shoot! Need help? Hold on! Slow down! I don't bite. I should turn and run. It's a miracle we met again. What do we do now? We can't just walk away. We'd never see each other again. Is that what you want? Julie! Julie? That's pretty. What do you do when you're not making life beautiful? You want to have lunch and talk? I'm going on vacation with my parents. No way! We have lunch first, then you can go. - No, I can't! - Why not? You really want lunch? Okay... Meet me here... - Friday. - Friday? In 3 days! Why not tomorrow? I have to go. I'm lost. What's the deal with 3 days? Why wait 3 days? - Who was that? - Tell you later. Would you believe it! A miracle! In Paris, I joke with your daughter, "Let's have lunch in Ibiza..." And who do I see Friday after walking 5 kms on the beach? Your daughter, Julie! Life amazes me! Is she following me? - You know him? - Of course she does! Simon Toledano, poodle deliveries. - It's very sweet but... - You can't refuse a gift. I paid for it. Let me hold him, darling. Comes from Pomerania. The last one. Now the poodle's delivered, Miss... I'll take my leave. Jesus, it's hot! I'll maybe take a dip before I head off. He's a real character! The water's great! It's wonderful! Say... Is Herv? your boyfriend? Girlfriend? I don't want to slip up. He's my uncle. You can dry off at the house. Dad's invited you to lunch. Your show was pretty impressive. But he hates bad language. Don't worry, I'll have him eating out of my hand. What about you? Are you happy to see me? Yes. Yes what? Happy or just happy? Very happy. You're not scared I'll turn you in? Would you? They don't extradite here. Feel like dancing? I love dancing. Since the first day, I want you. I can't find a better way of saying it. I love you. It's only a coincidence... No, that's when you run into someone. We met! It was destiny. There's no time to lose. Life flies by. I know you want me, too. The rest's bullshit. I need a shower. It's your scent, I... May 1968 was a ball! Me and my friends did all the marches. The best was the Stock Exchange. Doesn't that have a ring to it? We marched past and I shouted out, "Let's storm it!" We raced in, grabbed the janitor... "Where's the money?" He said, "They don't keep the money here." We thought he was shitting us. I mean that he was... We searched the place like total... We were very disappointed. I remember. It made all the front pages. Precisely! That's what I was saying. I wondered who could possibly imagine there was money there. In a word, you travel 3 days to deliver a dog to a girl who hates dogs and 3 days back again. Either you're an ass or you're in love with my daughter. We have other plans for her, but I will meet your father in Paris. My father? Last time I saw him was in jail. By chance, we both wound up in Fresnes. The guard caught us swapping notes. I ate mine and ended up in isolation. That's a souvenir of the place. The worst is, when I got out, my Dad had been released. I haven't seen him since. So, chances are low you'll meet him. I love your daughter. I'm not taking her from you, she's leaving you. Listen. I know my child isn't for you. It's your life. I won't judge you, but if you love her, go now before she gets back. It's me... Samy! It's fish scale! Get it now or wait 10 years! You guys mystify me. I've seen more active pensioners. All we do is African hookers. Save it for the cops, I won't buy it. It's a sin. I got a great bank lined up. At R?publique. African whores, I said. Shame. If you get your balls back, call me. 300 grand. Minimum 300 grand! Your pal not back yet? We're losing patience. Thanks for leaving me the choice. You don't know who I am. Maybe your Dad's right and I'm not the guy for you. If you're not, you're the one I was waiting for. Life's short. It flies by. At what age do you think it ends? When we separate. Look at them. Two Romeos, but real hoodlums. Doesn't he ever scare you? No, I feel safe with him, like nothing can happen to me. We can go overseas or... There's so much to do. Act the pimp, sure, but why? Screwing and robbing banks ain't compatible. We gotta get back to work soon. We do another set, then bye-bye. I don't believe it! Are you chicken? I'm changing my life. What? You're in love? Yeah, I think so. She tells me stuff and I think I can change. It's now or never. Let's go out in style. I know of a 300-grand job. Anybody beat that? Don't move! Hands up! Don't move! Put your hand up! Get your hand in the air! If the cops catch you wounded, you'll sell your mother. You're dangerous. Easy with the Perez. He saved your life. Move your ass, you! Get down there! Move it! Get inside there! Open that up! The teller's body was brought out by hostages. The criminals are still inside. The police, led by Capt. Brevard, sealed off the bank. We got a chance? None. Unless they get us all wrong. By shooting himself, Landais saved our lives. They'll think we're crazyheads. Yeah... You think that's for us? This is Capt. Brevard. Listen good, I won't say this twice. You've got 5 minutes or we're coming in. We'll show no mercy. Neither will we. How come the cops got here so fast? There's a problem. Somebody fucked us over. It's obvious. Answer it. Can we talk seriously? We are serious. What do you want? Carnage? What do you want? 2 million, a car, guns and a plane. That's all? No! We want the cash in used bills. Ask for more, accept less. What do you say? Call the minister. What now? This is Radio Europe... It's Radio Europe! The police were there. They'd been tipped off. We're ready to negotiate. They were fingered. The cops'll be round here soon. You can't go home tonight. I'll head down to R?publique. I'll find her a crib. Come on... We mustn't let them get away. It's France's first hostage-taking. It'd give people ideas. I'll negotiate, but they'll get it when they come out. Yes, sir, the women first. Yes, I understand. We've got our hands tied. Freedom of information, my ass! Freedom to inform their accomplices. All that station's good for, same as in 1968! Inspector, get your men in position. Yes, sir. Capt. Brevard! Inspector Milan, Belleville precinct. You're the undercover guy? I asked for you. Apparently, you know them. The guy who blew his brains out, Jacques Dumorat, aka Landais, worked with 2 ex-cons, Toledano and Casa, the hostage-takers, most likely, huh? You know that better than me. You were here before them. You think I'm stealing your prey? If you don't need me anymore, goodbye, Captain. The Commissioner on the phone. - Who's he? Name rings a bell. - His Dad was a cop. Got shot on the steps of HQ one day. He was on the take. Any news? I remember. We never got to the bottom of it. Commissioner, good evening! This isn't what we wanted. We screwed up. Shit! This isn't what we dreamed of. Do you remember? Doing something nobody had ever done. What are we doing here? How can you be sure? Maybe the revolution starts here. Our fortune, too. Maybe there's more here than in the vault. Oh yeah? - The keys would help... - Fuck! Doesn't that make you so hard? Imagine 500 more like that! Our names'd be up in lights! The cash yes, plane no. Okay, we want a fast car then. A BMW in 5 minutes! Not some jalopy. Release the women first. We'll leave them behind in the bank. Take it or leave it. Got the little jerk! Two gangsters are holed up in the bank with their hostages. The police operation is led by Capt. Brevard. They've sealed off the area to await the gangsters' surrender. You get that? They're waiting for us at Champerret. Let's go. Brevard to all officers. Stay vigilant, they're coming out. Marksman 1, lock on to individuals. Marksman 2, await instructions. Marksmen 1 and 2 ready. Just for me, kid, shoot first. Hold fire! The hostages are women! What's going on? Not the hostages! He's tricked us. Yes, Minister. Try it if you feel lucky. We've no back-up plan. Move it! Put your guns down! Open fire or lose them! Put your guns down. - Take it easy, guys! - Look at me! Hurry! No shooting with women there. That's an order! Stand clear! Don't do anything stupid! Drive! The gangsters got away from under the noses of police, taking 3 female hostages with them. Paris is in shock. The police are hunting for a BMW they gave the gangsters. For Captain Brevard, it's a bitter pill... Keep your eyes shut, girls! - Bad news, we forgot a bag again! - No way. We gotta outfox them. There are roadblocks everywhere. Okay, change of plans. I'm gonna stay here. If you're good, you'll be fine. Sing me a song. Do you know the Internationale? This is the final conflict I can't hear you! Capt. Brevard negotiated all night with them, eventually agreeing to pay a ransom of 2 million. They took 3 female hostages, who are still missing. The authorities are concerned after the hostage-takers' success... You have to forget Simon. He told me to tell you. Don't move, motherfucker! Get your hands up! Don't move! Look at me! Before he died, Landais tried to tell us something. He was clinging to a manhole cover. Why would a guy who's going to die do that? You don't know our nickname for you. We call you "Sewer". - Speak up! - Cocksucker! Talk! Stop crying, you motherfucking whore! Talk or I'll knock your teeth out! The Perez brothers made me do it. They wanted you out of the way. They forced me to talk to Landais. The Perez brothers made them an offer. A one-way trip to Italy in exchange for the ransom. Or what's left of it. The idiots left a bag in the bank. Don't I deserve a reward, Captain? We'll see about that. Nobody knows about the bag in the bank. The Perez brothers must be in on it. Let's pay those slimy bastards a visit. Look at me. Listen up. Never come back to Belleville. Got that? If Perez doesn't kill you... we will. Your pal's got money. He's a rich kid with balls as big as ours. You sure about this? Besides you, he's the only guy I trust. Make yourselves at home. You already have guests. You're kidding me! She said she'd go to the police. You can't stay, it's dangerous. We didn't want this. I wanted out. I meant all that I said. Where I'm going is no life for you. I'll leave the day you stop loving me. - Don't you love me? - I don't love you. You don't love me? I don't love you. I did the right thing. It's fucking crazy outside. Brevard raided the Perez gang. A full-on ambush. William and Charles bought it. I can't seem to shed a tear. R?publique's old news. You'll get overseas easy. I stole these from some tourists. Make the best forgeries. What's going on? I'll explain later. Fleeing. They had no alternative. They left unsure they'd ever be back. It was their first time outside France. Maybe that's why it didn't feel so bad. They were 25, had loads of cash, traveled the world first class, and they were in love. Nothing matters when you're in love. Not even a death sentence. Okay, guys? I talked to them. They're in Abidjan. Simon says a death sentence is the highest honor for a crook. As soon as things die down, they'll be back. Isn't that great news! What are you doing? Where is he? Who do you mean? Where are they, you son of a bitch? Screw you! What's all the noise? 2 years later At first, it was fun, but I got tired of it. I couldn't take it. In Ankara, Simon nearly lost it. Our hotel was full of cops. There was an OPEC meeting. We stayed 3 hours! Day after day, the fear increased. Don't go. I sent for you. Still after them? A good cop is a tenacious cop. I'll give you her. She's all yours. A leaving gift. I'm on the move. I got a promotion out in the provinces. I knew your father. Don't keep wondering. Truth needs to be simple. Internal Affairs made him look bad. You've got no reason to act like shit. But you nailed Mesrine. I learned my lesson at R?publique. Don't forget... The methods don't count, the result does. They didn't trust anyone. Even me. It was getting dangerous, stifling... - And so I'm here. - Do you know her? Was she with you? A hooker. One in a long list. I never knew her name. Simon loved hookers. They really do it for him. Where are they? Katmandu, maybe. Having fun is all they care about. They'll be long gone. In all profound consciousness, like that of the churches and all the major humanitarian organizations... Voted! In my own consciousness, I am against capital punishment. Voted! 3... 2... 1... Fran?ois Mitterrand is the new President! Goodbye. Death penalty abolished 30, fucking hell! What about 30? We're 30 years old. I never thought we'd live so old. I didn't plan for this. Me neither. Nor for that! To think I didn't want kids. She's just like me. The same seed doesn't always produce the same flowers. Come back here! That's enough, little girl! Dushka! He's gonna ask for our ID. He's a park guard, don't worry. Sweetheart! I know, Mommy's always late. Be on time just once! - I couldn't park. - Come on... Maybe Paris wasn't a good idea. Where'd she grow up? In the bush? Why not? A surprise for you, all the way from Romania... Hot to trot! Guys, we have work to do. Put them away! They don't understand French! What's on the agenda? We're gonna do safety deposit boxes. Here we go! Just to see if it works. We steal from the rich. With Mitterrand in power, they'll salt it all away. Cash, gold, jewels, all in their safety deposit box. And we break them open! No one will defend them. We'll be rich and popular, what's the problem? I like it. Best way to commit suicide. Lunkhead! Suicide is the stupid 20 G heists. And count me out of a gang war. I'm gone. Casa! Don't take it personally. They're happy for us. They wanna celebrate. You're not sure either. To make you smile, I'd join you in hell. Need a ride? It's not far, I'll walk. Weird how every day you disappear at the same time. Don't worry, I know the cops keep an eye on her. Seen my lighter? Was it a Zippo? Thanks. No problem. Hey, you! Police! Your ID! Passport! Now! - On your knees! - Don't! - Shut up! - Don't shoot! On your knees, I said! - Don't look at me! - Okay, it's cool. Don't move! Don't move! Go fuck yourselves! Stop or I fire! Are you okay? What's that music? Where's it coming from? There, I think. Over there! Bust it all up! It's over there now. Simon without Casa. Life without his guardian angel... thinking of the brother who saved him and he failed to save. Hands up! Nobody move! Get back! Sit down! Go through there. Through there! Freeze, you fucker! Move it! Watch them! It's taking too long! Have Brink's been? Is there an alarm? Eyes down! Look down, I said! No way! The noise'll alert the cops! I'll ask Jeannot. - What's going on? - Hear anything? They can hear you in Marseille. Calm down. They can't hear a thing. Come on! Get the right angle. Angle it like that! That's right. Let me do it. Watch the manager. - Don't move. - I'm not. Let's see! Casa was right all down the line. So now we know. Next time's the biggest heist ever. He's right. Come back at night. We finish up here! If you're scared, wait in the cars. We need to practice! You can't just open them, gotta open them quick! See you. You're not coming for lunch? Katmandu, was it? All roads lead home. We checked all the hotels you told us about. We questioned the waiters, clerks, chambermaids... They all mentioned the same woman. Not a hooker or one-night stand. A Frenchwoman. Classy. Who is she? I don't know. Who is she? - I don't know. - Tell me her name. Who is she? I only know her first name. Julie. Could be an alias. Is that her? Only I can protect you now. Choose your side. Is that her? - Is that her? - Yes. Give me a clue where I can find her. I don't know. Where can I find her? Where? Tell me! One night in the park, we got booked by a patrol. All four of us were there. See, it's not so hard. I find her, she takes me to Toledano. How does a guy with life in jail hanging over him and his mugshot in every station and airport live in Paris without us knowing? Did we know about Casa before he got shot? A week later, a heist in broad daylight, breaking all the rules. Pure provocation. I know him. That's his trademark. Maybe he died in the jungle. He'd like us to think that. Stop chasing ghosts, son. You've no proof. Help me find some! And stop calling me "son"! 3 years of patrol reports. How long to find an ID check in a park dating back... 6 years. A week before the R?publique job. It'll take him centuries! Thanks for organizing the funeral. I loved Casa as much as you. Go easy on yourself. It wasn't your fault. Other than that... What makes a boy from a good home turn bad? I enjoy it. The same seeds produce different plants. That's lucky. I need a guy like you. A guy with your education and nerves to look after old folks and wannabe heroes without bloodshed. You get me? In a month, you earn 150 G with the same risk as for 15. You know who I am? A lifer who won't go without a fight when the cops show. I'm in. I'll contact you in a week with the details. Tell me, where did you meet Casa? High school. Was he a good student? - He graduated. - Really? Sorry, we got the wrong... Take your pick! Really suits you, Rabbi! He's a priest. This is the rabbi! I'd have preferred colonel. Next time. In the bank, I set the ball rolling. Okay, if you want. Wonderful! Stay just as you are! Aren't these disguises a bit gimmicky? Kind of to get publicity. Think about it. If you work in a bank and a pilot or a soldier in uniform walks in, you trust them instantly. The French like uniforms, haven't you noticed? For a whole month, we're in boot camp. No sex, no drugs, no contact with anyone. We work in bursts. 20 banks at a time. Never when school's out or on Mondays. Too many customers. The aim is zero casualties on both sides, the book of records not the obituary pages. Never the same gang. Sometimes 5 of us, sometimes 10. We hire them at the last minute for 1 or 2 jobs, pay them off and get others in. They always see us in disguise. We scramble the cops' brains. By the time they get onto us, we'll be rich and far away. I want to make a small deposit. Don't move! Hands where they are! - Freeze! This is a tax audit! - What did he say? I thought "tax audit" or "we're from Welfare", but "Freeze! We're from Welfare!" sounds funny. - It's only me. - What do you want? This is Capt. Santy of 16th Precinct. We're old friends. You weren't in your office. Got anything on this heist? Nothing. No leads. They're real pros. 2 hours in a bank in daytime, no violence. Impressive. We've got our heads up our asses! If they strike again, call us. Worth a bit, huh? We'll melt it all down. I'll pay you by weight in gold. I know people who can launder the cash. They take 30%. Thanks, Ilyo. 30? A small price to pay for security. The news! We must rate a mention. Yeah, turn it up! Hello, the Wig Gang. Goodbye, money! For the 3rd time in a week, 8 armed robbers in disguise broke open 50 safety deposit boxes... It was easy for them. Hold-up this afternoon in Paris... ...in masks... They spoke good French... The police took witnesses to be questioned... The Wig Gang strikes again... The Gang takes ingots and money, leaving documents that interest the police, who are the first on the scene after the Wig Gang departs. A pact between felons and police? Who benefits most from the crime? Captain... The Rabbi didn't take the tape from the security camera. They told him it was bust. - Where's the tape? - I'll show you. Let's go! Quickly! We're from Intelligence. Fargeon and Morel. Some of the owners were on the red list. - Got anything? - Plenty! It's all over the floor. I have work to do. Goodbye. "Capt. Santy collars the Wig Gang!" Wouldn't that be great? Our security equipment is state-of-the-art. We'll see. In here... There... - Did you put a tape in? - Hold on. It should work. Is that the right tape? - There's a problem. - That's your big scoop? I promise you... Jesus! They're lucky bastards! - Did you watch it? - No, but... "No, but"? That won't get us anywhere. Anything to report? No, nothing. The Minister will like what we found. - What brings you here? - Claire's birthday. I know. You scared me. Princess! You prefer Daddy or Mommy? - Marsupilami! - That's right, he's all yours. - Thanks, Daddy. - Tell them you're the prettiest! I asked Daddy to come... Good idea. I picked him up and drove him round and round. - I even blindfolded him. - That's great. God, I missed you. You're crazy! I didn't know where you were. Surprise! Next month, we go on vacation. Just us two? The photo with Granddad! I'll drive you back. I can't take this! Fuck it! I didn't understand a word. I'm sick of Honolulu. 3 months' eating, screwing and splashing cash. It's not a life! Paris, wine and girls... Why'd we run? Maybe the VCR was bust. My business is to bring everyone home and I take no risks. Next time, you won't forget to check. Check this out! - What is it? - A scanner. Tune into police radios. Available in all good drugstores. The advantage of travel. You're the only one on the run. We could be in Paris. I'm keeping you clear of temptation and me out of trouble. Enjoy it and stop whining. Isn't this great? It's your fault. I got it bad. I need a fix of bank-robbing. The scent of stolen money gives you a stiffy! Like us. I love the silence when we arrive. It's very restful. We found your report. Julie Verron lived here. It took 2 years. That sucks. Nobody's seen her since the R?publique job. But her folks live here. Well? Don't I get any thanks? Magic! Look! When we retire, let's sail round the world. Trouble is, I get sea sick. Does it work? Nothing yet. Great vacation. Just the 2 of us. Put some cream on. Got some? Little woman give her big man massage. Good woman. What is that? It smells funny. Biafine cream. You no like? - What's your game? - And yours? You gonna hit me? What's your problem? What's wrong with you? What am I to you? Everything. My best ever hold-up. What's up? What's wrong? I don't know. I'll be 30 this year. You're 30? You're getting old. I'll have to trade you in. You bastard! And you think it's funny! Don't move! How about that? Still no good. Your antenna's useless. - Now? - It doesn't work. I'll try over there. Your antenna's useless. That's it! It works! Stick it in the sand! Crime news... The Wig Gang strikes in the provinces. In Toulouse, a man was seriously injured. Who are the Wigs working for? Are there Wig Gang imitators? Some sources suggest they're cops opposed to the Socialist government or forces under the orders of the Interior Minister. The sources offer varying... Cops? Cops robbing banks? Apparently. Not rogue cops, real ones! Not all the heists, but some have military organization. They took cash and all the documents. You shouldn't hang around here. A last look before they demolish. My Mom'll be sad. She's got 3 bedrooms now, near Nation. To think 12 of us lived here. Listen, son... that's for the flowers on Casa's grave. Can you do me a favor? Look up all the Toledanos in hospices or homes. - Toledano? - Yeah. How's it spelt? B-E-N-A... I - two dots on the I - M. - Benaim. That's my new name. - Very good. And where's your father? He's always traveling. And that's true. Yes, that's true. Come on, let's go. We broke in and the cops took advantage. It was fair enough. Now they break in and blame it on us. It's like we're accomplices. To the murder of our friends. - That stinks! - So we quit? No, we keep going. But we'll make them pay for exploiting us, so they're shit scared we'll take them down with us. One day, we will go down. I'm not forcing you... Is this the Wig Gang at work again or even more imitators? In 2 weeks, they have robbed 5 banks... ...about the peculiar inefficiency of the police. There were documents everywhere... ...dozens of safety deposit boxes, in broad daylight. It's becoming a regular occurrence... After Pierre Joxe's appointment, replacing Gaston Defferre, the police expect the new Minister to give clear instructions. I am not Defferre. The message is clear. Stop the Wig Gang, real ones, fake ones and look-alikes, even if they facilitated our work. Commissioner Brevard recommended you. Arrest the Wig Gang before they talk. There must be only one version. I'm not into politics. My job's arresting felons. The heists are the work of one gang. Do whatever it takes, we'll cover you. Today, we do 200, guys! Are you game? Sit down there. This won't take long. Face the wall, everybody. Watch them. C'mon, faster! - What about this? - That's just paperwork! C2 to T1. Suspicious readings. Strange noises. Go check it out. Sir... - What? - You should go. They installed detectors. The police will come. We'll all die. The cops are on their way. We have to get out of here! Let's go! Move it! Hands up and don't move! Let's get outta here! Hurry! - What's going on? - Drive! Maxime! Where is he? Stand back! Don't wait for us! What are you doing? Okay, look! 200! You beat the record! Look at me! We gotta split! Fucker! Out the way! You okay? ...making fools of the state and every plan they come up with. The situation is quite simple. Who in France can stop the Wigs? Captain, get me off a rap and I'll tell you about Ilyo. Everybody knows about Ilyo. We're from the same country. I know something about him nobody else knows. Samy the Sewer. Found him in the gutter. A sad end. I hear you were cousins, right? I'm paid to find out stuff. Heard of the Wig Gang? Don't read the papers, huh? And Toledano? I haven't heard from him in years. Of course not. You're boring me. Know what? Forget your residency permit. Then, I'll tell people he was the stoolie. They'll like that. And we'll visit you every day. Rats'll cross the street to avoid you. Vermin gets paranoid. They know how much you rake off? All I know is what people say. What do people say? Look at him! Look at your cousin! Look at him good! Open up! I can't hear you! Open up! - What? - I'll talk! Let's hear it! Toledano's invisible. They only meet for a job. I know all that! They pick the bank at the last minute. That's why they're untouchable. They shower people with cash. Listen. When he slips up, call me or you'll wish you were dead. Look... It's all yours now. Granddad! Claire! Sweetheart... - Late again. - Sorry. I ran. As usual. Bye, honey. See you next week. Why don't we ever go straight home? To see if the bad guys are following us, my child. What do you want for Xmas? How about a doll? Aren't you excited? Xmas is a sad time of year. When I was a kid, I hated Christmas. It freaked me out. I had a reason. My Dad was never there. At Xmas, you need your Dad. It wasn't easy for my Mom, not knowing where he was, worrying about him... That's not a life. Mommy, pee-pee. Come on, honey, this way. - You surprised me. - I came in the back door. Shit! Move! He hasn't been in? Julie's outside. Why'd you come here? It's no... It's no place for a kid. Why didn't you call? Nobody had seen you! Maybe you're being paranoid. You don't believe me? He followed us. Claire saw him in the park. That's no reason to panic like this. - You're not scared, you're dead. - What? You're losing it. Why are you here? You're leaving me? - Leave me the kid. - You're insane! - What's up? - What are you on? - Let go of me! - Calm down. - That hurts! - If he was a cop, at worst, all they have is Claire's school. All our details there are made up. We change school and move. Problem solved. It's so easy for you. I can't take any more. It's too hard. I know I shouldn't have let Daddy go to her school. - Why weren't you there? - It's done now. You're scared? I'm careful. Don't be scared. - I'm preparing our future. - Oh yeah? That's why Merle stopped me at the door? Now, you are getting paranoid! I have nothing to hide, nothing at all. It's my fault. I knew it. I don't look after you both. I never have. I'll take Claire to school tomorrow. I'll take her to school now. Anyway... You should get some sleep. With the cops onto us, we've got to lay low. More books! You've already read them! The car'll be full. Trash the rest of them. We can take them where you're going. You want my address? What's wrong with you? - What is it? - Daddy! Mommy! It's him! She's right. The chances are they'll strike again... Who is this guy? - Who is he? You know him? - Never saw him. My message is, their days are numbered. Captain, is it the work of one or several gangs? We'll be here all night. Wake up! He lives alone. Orphanage Admission Ambush A good crook is a dead crook Corrupt cop or gang victim? We got a call to a burglary. I phoned you right away... Is anything missing? No, nothing. What? What's wrong? You surprise me. I don't give a shit what you think. There's only one rule that matters. Get your man. - Screw the rest! - No! Nothing stolen, are you sure? Not even a tape, perhaps? Keeping evidence is forbidden. Even if you get your man. But you're above all that. You cut a deal. Didn't you, son? A cop doesn't rat on another cop. It's certain suicide. Ask for a transfer. Someplace warm and far away. I'll put in a word. I found your Toledano at St. George's Hospital. Thanks. There's no smoking in the hospital. You know who I am. I've been looking for you for years. When I was a kid and you made it home, those were the times I liked best. I liked you being home. But you always set your alarm... I wanted us to be together all the next day. One night, I turned your alarm off. You overslept and the cops arrived. Simon never knew if his father recognized or forgave him. The next time he visited, his father had disappeared. He never saw him again. - Evening. - He's rude, the new neighbor. What are you doing here? I wanted to talk, not just walk out. Walk out? What the hell is going on? Where's Claire? In a safe place. She thought it was a toy. It was in her book-bag. How can you leave that lying around? Why was she looking in the bathroom? I needed an aspirin. That's not the problem. That's not it! - You're the problem! - Wreck it! - You're the problem! - I have plenty more! How many more women and kids, too? You're talking shit! What do you want from me? Nothing anymore. I thought I had a man, not an autistic cokehead. Yeah, right. - You can't fuck without that shit! - You're staying here! I don't trust you anymore. I've no regrets but life moves on. I'll pay the price. What are you babbling about? What is this bullshit? Tell me! There's nothing to pay! Let me handle things. I don't want you to go. I'll leave as soon as you're on one of your trips. Shut up! - Don't talk shit. - Look at me. I'm alive and he's dead! Who's dead? You know who. Killing yourself won't bring Casa back. You want to die. I want to live. I don't want to stay with you. Leave her alone. Do you want some? Don't threaten my Dad! Go on, hit me! Stop! You fucker! Stop! - Enough! - Let go of her! Stop, Daddy! Let go of her! It's okay. It wasn't loaded. It's too late. To get out, it's too late. If you love us, you'll find a way. Let go of me. Claire and me are leaving in 2 days. My parents have friends in Quebec. It's me. They did a job in Neuilly. We just missed them. They always do two in a day. Keep all units mobilized till 3. We'll pay overtime. 2 beers coming up! It was a close shave, a new alarm system. Yeah... Everything's changing now anyway. But I see clearly now. I messed up at Milan's with the photos. Now he knows he's right and he'll be after me. Which means you guys are next. - He's not got that far yet. - What? He's not that far yet. For him, it's personal. It's written on his walls. You must be joking! He wants to wipe us out like Brevard blew away Mesrine. Didn't we expect to go head-to-head? What option do we have? Hide all our lives. Simon's right. Everything's changed. We gotta get away. Maybe sail round the world. - The time is right. - I ain't leaving. - You got a boat? - We could buy a thousand. - Don't touch our capital, you said. - Right. One last loan to buy the boat. It'll take an hour. Isn't there one round here? Heads, we do it. Tails, we don't. Okay, we do it. Let's get to work! Remember Rue Docteur Blanche? The first one we did. There's one next door. Polite manager and staff. Rich pickings. I know, I have an account. Okay, see you at yours. - Are you asleep? - Yeah, see you later. The Action Unit will share command of the mission. Fine. Our orders are clear. No action in the streets. We wait for them to leave, tail them and pick them up at their hideout. You know what you have to do. In position! We're riding together. - Are you stiffing me? - The Commissioner insisted. Says you've no operational experience. Everybody wants in now, huh? We could catch them in the act. Now, they'll give us the slip. - It's now or never. - Keep calm. You know your deputy asked to see Internal Affairs? He has things to say? We all have things to say. Or hear. Our conversations. You can confirm I'm still covered? Scramble your radios. In the cars or on foot, keep switching around. Don't let them see you. We've been after them for 6 years. Don't mess it up now. Receiving you, TV54. Loud and clear, TV52. Receiving you, park unit. Receiving you, bank unit. Stay put for now. The clip's visible. Coast's clear. I feel like taking the bus. They're coming out. Lone individual. Priest disguise. Heavily built. Short hair. Mustache. Stay put till they're all out. They have hostages. Tail the priest. - We go? - He's not ours. We'll lose him. He's catching the bus. - What do we do? - He's on the bus. N? 22 to Op?ra. The others are coming out. Loading up a blue BMW getaway car. - Don't lose them. - I can't go on my own. Tail them! The others are still inside. Holy shit! Drive! Police! Get out of the way! They've gone left. A truck's blocked the street. Can you confirm the van is suspect? Who are the guys in the van with? Hold on. Back up. BMW stationary. Perps still inside. Forget about the van. V1 to V2... More coming out. 2 individuals. A rabbi and a pilot. The pilot's gone the other way. Let's move in. We sit tight and follow them when they leave. Follow who? The bus? The BMW? Them? We'll just lose them as usual. Fuck you! Get off me! Don't be stupid! Police, freeze! What the fuck's going on? Hold on! - Don't move! - You fuckers! Stop or I'll fire! Give me the cuffs! Hold him down! It's over! Don't move! They're getting out. What do I do? What do I do? They're coming my way! Hurry! They're headed this way! Fire! Police! Don't move! Stay where you are! Look at me... - What have you done? - Cut it out! - He said sit tight! - Can it! Quick! Officer down! Don't move! Back up! Back up slowly! Back up slowly that way! Put your gun down. Drop it. Get me out of here! - Release my friend! - Fire! Release my friend! What's he doing? Release him! Fire! Shut the fuck up! Get in the car! Back up! Get in the fucking car! Open the door! Gonna chance it or buy one right now? - Get in. - Don't move, guys! Nobody play the hero! - Fuckers! - Look me in the eyes. Look at me! Eyes on the road! Come back here! Forget him. Let's go! Get out! Get out! Move it! Get in! We're okay! 1 officer shot dead, 1 gangster killed, another officer wounded, civilians shaken up... The Wig Gang's 101st attack became a fatal scramble. What happened exactly? The investigation into the hold-up, led by Capt. Dufour, should answer all these questions. This hold-up ended in carnage... Did you hear the radio? Motherfucker! They're calling us murderers! One more death, what difference? Kill him and he's a hero. Does he look like a hero? You my guardian angel? That's twice you've saved my life. What's that, cop? I don't know no Toledano. Why the orphanage? Even your folks rejected you? You got the wrong guy. My parents gave me a lot of love. Can't say the same for you, apparently. I didn't kill your Dad, but he deserved it. I won't send you the same way. Go to hell all by yourself. You can run but you won't get far. You're finished! You're a dead man! Hear me? I'll be right behind you! I'll find you! Finish your milk and let's go. Still no news of Simon Toledano, sentenced to life and reputed to be the leader of the Wig Gang. Reported sightings in Germany, Spain and Italy... Participation in the escape of one of his accomplices from a jail in Rome... Many rumors surround this extraordinary outlaw, whom police are confident of recapturing rapidly now the Gang's hideouts have all been traced. How does it go? The end? Nobody ever made it back to say. I guess it all hinges on a fraction of a second. A guy decides to shoot to kill. And then it's over. We're almost there, aren't we? We'll take some with us. Up there, we'll meet up with the guys. Cool! Freeze! Where are the others? Where are they? Upstairs. - Don't bullshit me! - They're upstairs. Let me talk to them! I'm in front! Don't shoot! It's over, but we haven't lost! Nobody will ever do what we did! We have to live to tell the tale. We're gonna make it. Alive! All they've got is masks! Surviving's our biggest success! - We're betraying no one! - Shut it! You have 10 seconds to come out. We gotta live! We're betraying no one! Your guns! Throw out your guns! That's good! Life! Life! On the floor! Come out! On your knees! Don't move! Lie down! It's over now! Good morning, Mr. D.A. Daniela Volpi says she went on the run with you and Casafarti after your R?publique heist. She can't have said that. - Sorry? - Was she in the bank? Of course not. Who then? Who told her it was us? Me? No, because I wasn't there. Casa? He's dead. A dead man can't testify. So, who then? She didn't claim you told her. Your name was in all the papers. Since when does a newspaper report count as proof? Arrest Julie Verron and he'll soon talk, you'll see. Try it and we'll get your wife. Anyway, she's not in France. Sorry, but according to our reports, Ms. Verron returned of her own accord last week. So, what do I do now? I want to see her. Then, we'll talk. You take her! If they find proof, I'll get 20 years. If not, 10. Maybe 8 with parole. People died. Somebody's gotta be punished. Will you wait for me? As long as it takes. 8 years later Welcome back to civilization. I'm still a Captain. I even got promoted thanks to you. Tell me... Gonna chance it or buy one right now? Out! C'mon, get out! Recognize this? Where'd you hide the cash? Come on! Hurry up! Dig! 8 years in the can was easy. Now, it's gonna be hell. You're gonna pay. You're gonna pay. It's the least you owe your dead pals. It was here. I don't get it. It's gone. My back! My back's broken! No, not like this! Not like this, cop! Are you okay? I'm fine. I was dreaming. A nightmare, always the same. - I got out early. - I was on time for once. Thanks for being here. Thank you. For 8 years, he refused to let me visit. Whatever he did, he's my Dad and I love him and now I'll make up for lost time. I've waited long enough. C'mon, let's go! It took me months to learn to live normally again, walking into a bank or in the street without anxiety. Okay? Fine. I think I'll be fine. Feels weird going into a bank. Let's walk a bit. Julie was a huge help. I couldn't have done it without her. When we all got out of jail, we went to dig up the cash, but it had gone, like in my nightmare. Nobody accused anybody, but we never saw each other again. Every day, I think about them, the living and dead. - Where are you? - The blue light! - Put the blue light on! - It doesn't work. Casa, you take over. I'm alive and Julie's still at my side. She's why I wasn't a regular crook. She shielded me, made the difference. Some days, in a burst of adrenalin, on my scooter, I ride up a one-way street, just to see... Living a quiet life, retired from the business... I was ready for everything, except that. Partially inspired by Andr? Bellaiche and the charges of which he was acquitted.
