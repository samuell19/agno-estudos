Will you tell me a tale? A tale right now? Don't you watch television? I don't like the tales on TV. Well, maybe I can tell you a story. What's the difference between a tale and a story? A story is a tale that happened in reality. In reality? Yes. What's the matter? I've lost my way. While There is Light - How many days? - Three. I hate traveling. I wish I'd lived in the times of real traveling. When a spectacle, not yet wasted, cursed, offered to demand nothing in return. But I'm nothing more than an alternative kind of prisoner. An ancient traveler faced with a prodigious spectacle from which I will learn nothing or almost nothing. Or even worse, me being inspired by mockery or disgust. A modern traveler who runs after the remains of a reality that disappeared. Juan! And what's the matter with you? This place is like it doesn't exist. Hey! One moment! Hey! - What's the matter? - Run! What's this about? You're finally home. Home? I'm not sure. How do you say it? Madrid? Madrid. Madrid. Madrid. Madrid. Madrid. Just Madrid. Madrid. Madrid. How do you say "mommy", for example? - Mommy. - Just mommy. Madrid. Mommy. Madrid. You're kidding. Mommy. Just Madrid. Shit! Goddamn noise! Closing operation. Prism notebooks 2 & 6. Museum of Art and Popular Traditions, Archaeology Department, Faculty of Philosophy and Letters What are you doing here? You're not allowed to be here. Please leave! Please! Jorge! You were hungry! I'm on a diet. It's undercooked. Do yo now anything about Jaime? What am I supposed to know? We learned everything from him. You and me. How long have you been out? For longer than you would think. Things change quickly. Are you still doing the same stuff? Jaime. Jaime. Jaime. We haven't heard from Jaime in months. But that's normal. He likes to play, hide, create mysteries. He's a terrorist. Him being a scientist is just a circumstance. Searching is part of the mystery, isn't it? I don't know many who have achieved what he did, with his method, without methods. That's alreay over. Who says so? You can't work without a certain rigour, without sharing. The department is not the right place for individuals. Do you want to end the mysteries, the Jaimes, the personalistic attitudes, the adventures? There's a technique that helps us, we have to be scientists. We've all accepted it. Besides, at this point, what the hell do you expect from Jaime? Kings of fire and rain in Colombia are not allowed to die a natural death. This is why they are stabbed by the chief's family when they are sick. In the Congo people believe the world would come to its end if a shaman... - Chaman or shaman? - Shaman. Yeah, if a shaman died in a tribe. You talk like an Englis actor. Therefore his successor enters his home and strangles him before he could die a natural death. - It's horrible. - Yes, terrfific. I was in Africa for the first time two years ago. - Really? - Hmm. And you know what I saw? My ancestors. Swindling people. Tourists. Where are the bubbles here? What's up with a little bubbles? - You want bubbles? I give you bubbles. - This is rubbish. We got a Spanish word for that, we've got: "Camelo (hoax)". A real Camelo. Mr. Camelo. Oh God! You don't believe in this travel, do you? Let's go for a walk! You got to know how to use these things. At the right time and in the right place. Besides, here, I control everything, even the asses. Do you understand? Go ahead! To the door! An angel! Close your eyes! Open! Nobody's heard from Jaime in a long time. I know what's next. Not even Marisa. Are you seeing her? A long time ago, at Wattemberg's house. Wattemberg? Is he still alive? They're keeping him alive. One day a jaguar, sad because his food has been stolen, cries. Then, an anteater appears in the jungle and the jaguar invites him to do a shitting contest. The anteater trades his shit for the jaguar's shit without that one finding out. The jaguar's shit contains raw meat; the anteater's shit contains ants. And the bear makes the jaguar believe that its shit is the one containing the ants. To get revenge the jaguar invites the anteater to juggle with its own eyes. They're thrown into the air. The eyes of the anteater fall into place, the eyes of the jaguar become entangled at the top of a tree, it becomes blind. The jaguar then asks the macuco bird to make it eyes out of water, so that it can at least see in the dark. Since then, the jaguar comes out only at night. and never attacked the macuco again. Jaime? No. No. - Can I have a glass of wine? - No. Yes. During a tough week in which they have endured severe UEFA sanctions, Real Madrid's whites have run more than ever and with two goals from Gordillo and one from Martin Vazquez, they are still still the leading team with 22 wins in 37 games. Hugo Sanchez didn't see a goal, but in an interview with Televisa de Mexico... I'm leaving. Maybe I didn't... You didn't... Just give me a week! It's really not a matter of time. But I love you. I know. What did you expect from this trip? Answer the question for you. This is not my country now. I need you. You're my country now. I'm leaving. Shit! That what was found in the place where we suppose Jaime stayed when he was... Since the last time we saw him. Have you looked for him? I asked for it on a personal basis, do you understand? Nothing official. That's beginning to get serious. In what sense? - What do you have to tell? - I have nothing to tell, there are only unconnected facts and that camera with a half-zero reel. What do you think you're gonna find in a photo camera? Why didn't you develop the photos yourself? I don't have the slightest interest in finding Jaime. You're afraid! Maybe you're right. I'm afraid an irresponsible person will ruin the work I've been doing. That isn't fear. Not the fear that I'm talking about. You're here? When did you get here? No one expected you. I want to see you. Me, too. How old were you when you left? Twenty. Twenty. And Jaime? I don't know, I've never known his age. You've known him for ten years. Twelve. But I'm not sure if I know him. Why are you saying that? Who are you? What are you doing here? I live here. And me. You are Jaime's daughter. - You are... - Maria. You're Jorge. You don't look like your father. Neither do you. What do you think of your father? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? What am I supposed to think? Maybe you need one, I don't. - That's spite. - No. I just don't need a father. Maybe you're right. Besides, then you'd have to get rid of him. Have you already done it? You'll see later how to get all that out of your face. Now... It was so easy, you know? There's little to gain here. We both needed the money. All the money. Just some pieces had to be discarded. Not including them in the catalogue. They waited. They saw them. They always paid well. Jaime confided in himself and I got scared. My situation here had changed, it had improved. I decided not to continue. But he didn't want to understand anything. It's funny. I've never found pieces of such value. For so many years. I've seen him shatter his hands, when a shitty piece of clay fell off. But this was gold. Gold! Now I don't know. They must be looking for him. He's changed his organization without saying anything. They must have offered him more, I suppose. Marisa doesn't know anything, I swear. And him? Where is he? I haven't heard anything in months. Lately he sent his daughter money, without writing, without calling. And now I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Jorge. Help me! What? No! Give him this! - Are you Spanish? - From Guip?zcoa. Would you please show me your passport? And your bag! Thank you! - A coffee! - I don't have. Beer? Stand here, Sir! "This Man is Dangerous" - Hello, good morning. - Good morning. - What do you want? - Do you have any rooms? Yes, I do. - Is it just for you? - Yes, just me. - How many nights? - I don't know. I.D. card or passport? Something. That's a fish. Tell me how much it is, please. The young lady paid. That's swordfish. - Sure. - Sure? Swordfish. Is it good? It's a little tough. I ate that in Bahia, Brazil. You've been to Brazil. And you don't speak Portuguese? No. I understand it. I understand that. I only lived with Indians in the forest. Mato Grosso, in the interior part. Brazil. It's very far from here. There are no Indians here. I'm looking for someone, sorry, somebody. Portuguese? No. One of your lost Indians? No. Here you will only find fishermen, peasant folk... Foreigners have already left. They left. Or they are in Lisbon, Estoril, and... And? You might be looking for someone who doesn't want you to find him. It's possible. Why are you looking for him if that's possible? I'm his friend. If you're his friend, you should know how he thinks. Friends know how their friends feel. At times it's not easy. In that case you should leave. Come back once you know. There are people that love him. That doesn't mean anything many times. You know a lot about my friend. A bit. As a friend. Will you help me find him? To find him. No. The border is right here. She's got nothing on her, damn it. What happened? They took him away. There's little to tell, is there? At least you don't have to tell us anything. You and I know that we're not going to find Jaime. Are you all right? How long have you been here? A bit less than a year. Have you ever written home? No, I've never written home. You didn't talk to Marisa then. No. Your daughter gave me this for you. Read it. - Do you mind? - No. "Dad, don't come back. Don't send any more money. Let your wife live her life. No one's ever gonna hold you accountable. Ana has changed schools, I have a job. Mom was very happy about Jorge's arrival. He's gonna come looking for you, but there's no reason for you to return. Goodbye, Maria" When you love, it's better to leave. Leave your wife. Leave your child... Leave your male friend. Leave your female friend... Leave your lovers... When you love, it's better to leave. The world is full of black men and women... Full of men and women, men, women... Look at these nice stores! This care, that man... this woman, that car... and all those beautiful things... You've got the air, you've got the wind... The mountains, the water, the sky... The earth, the children, the animals, the plants and charcoal... Learn to sell, to buy, to sell again... Give, take, give, take... When you love, it's better to sing, to run, to eat, to drink, to whistle and to learn working... When you love, it's better to leave... Don't cry and smile at time... Don't get leveraged between two breasts... Breathe... walk... leave... Go! I take a bath and look... I see the mouth that I know... the hand, the leg, the eye... I take a bath... and look... The entire world is still there... life full of surprising things... I sleep... I leave the pharmacy... I get off the scale... I weigh my eighty kilos... I love you... (Blaise Cendrars) I want you to leave. Where to? That's your problem. - It's a giant television. -It's a radar. It's a billboard for advertisements. It was a movie theater. Come on, let's go!
