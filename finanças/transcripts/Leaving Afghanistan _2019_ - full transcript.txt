In hallowed memory of the Army General Nikolai Dmitrievich Kovalyov Year 1989 The Soviet-Afghan War was dragged on for almost a decade. The armed struggle of the Soviet army against the Mujahideen resulted in a deadlock. 15 000 Soviet soldiers and over 90 000 Afghans have already died. As "perestroika" progresses the Soviet government decides to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. But to end a was is much harder than to start one. The movie is based on real events that follow the withdrawal of the 108th Motor Rifle Division through the Salang Pass. An official statement issued by the Soviet Government: As it leaves Afghanistan on its own goodwill and in agreement with the Afghan leadership, the Soviet Union nevertheless will continue its attempts to facilitate a peaceful and pervasive Afghan resolution. We hope the Afghan people will choose a path of peace and harmony. Only this way will end the bloodshed in Afghanistan. The future state in Afghanistan in large part depends on whether the other members of the Geneva Accords follow the example of the USSR and the Afghanistan Government. Will the armed opposition, acting from Pakistan and Iran... Silence means a cop is born. That's what they say in Moscow, right? You've ever seen a live cop? In fact, I lived in Moscow for almost 6 years. I had a girl there. We were going to get married. But then her mom came and kicked me out. With a filthy broom? Did you find a new bride? Yes, I found one from Nazareth Sharif. I have her pic. A very beautiful girl. Beautiful indeed! - Why don't you get married? - It's too expensive! Yeah, expensive. The buyout for the bride is 2,000 dollars. Gimme. - Let me see! - No. What are you yelling? I can't understand a single word! Thank God you came. It's a mess here! They're yelling, but I don't understand anything. - Hi! - How's everything?! The caravan goes from Khost to Herat, and then to Iran. We searched them. Now they're yelling the money is gone. 500,000 Afghani. This one's money. He is saying they took the money away and broke his nose. Too bad about the nose. He was out of control, shit happens. - Did you search your men? - Twice. Want some canned meat, Comrade Major? What you got in your canister? That's not our canister. I guess it's theirs. That's chief of the caravan. We have to talk to him. He says their money was stolen. The money should be returned. Now we all go to police station together. There we make an inventory of all the goods, find who is guilty, who stole what. And we'll punish them, tell him. Are you kidding? We aren't going to no police. He won't go anywhere. Get ready. We are leaving! I know him. He's from Helmand. Have you settled it? Can you wait 10 or 15 minutes? I'll talk to my men, and we'll go together. Don't, in 15 minutes we'll be at the checkpoint in Charikar. Alright, we'll come with you. - Thanks. - Dmitrich... - Bye. - Take care. They're carrying heroin. What else is there to carry? Wait, Dmitrich. You knew they wouldn't go to police? I figured. Wait. Uzbek, let's go! Every time and again it's you, Larkov? How much longer are you going to make problems for me? How much longer, I ask? Okay? Did you figure out where the money was? Perhaps, there wasn't any money there. There was, in the canister. Why didn't you say so? The boys deserve to earn a little something. The war's ending, they'll go home soon. At least some wherewithal. 500,000 Afghani is good money. Almost 200 dollars. You'd like this kind of money, right, Uzbek? Would you? a film by Pavel Lungin BROTHERHOOD Based on a true story Hello. You found my machine gun? And I was wondering where it was. Got it. You have a gun, I have a gun. Look, I'm taking it off. Slowly. Here, I'm taking my gun out. Look, off it goes! And this, too. Let's get acquainted. I am Alexander, Sasha for short. What's your name? No? You don't understand? How are you? I'm very glad to see you. Acacia to 55... 55, do you read me? 55, over. Do you copy? 55, come in. 55, Acacia's on the line. Over! Acacia, expect assistance any moment! Our guys... 108th division... - Look. - Dead? Yes. Flour. They blew up a caravan with flour. Banged it. Third one this week. It's engineer Hoshem's job. They show up out of nowhere and disappear... Hoshem controls the Salang pass. That's it. He's dead. He'll ruin our food supplying. - What? - An ambush, many wounded. Help us. Four vehicles destroyed... Quickly! Don't know about the men. Over! Careful. Acacia, the choppers will help! - You got a pain killer? - Ran out of it. Here! Acacia to 55, do you read me? Acacia to 55, do you read me? Call a chopper! Square B6. You copy? This one dead, too. Dmitrich, come here. C'mon, let's lift him. Over here. - Hold him! - I am. Dushmans... Dushmans... Dushmans... Dushmans! They're here... Dushmans! They killed all of us!.. Dushmans! Easy. They're gone. Quiet. Come, come... - It's over. - They're gone. Come, come... General, according to our information, the pilot catapulted in this area. We sent out a bunch of helicopters, special unit is on it right now. Go on. Our sputniks detected the crash scene. The beacon smashed and no traces of combat. Either the pilot is unconscious, or... Do you understand that the pilot is my son? We've alerted all agents. You understand he's my son? We're doing our best. We hope we'll find him. You must find him. He's my only one. There're a lot of cool tape recorders now. The best are Akai, Hitachi, JVC. What else... Grundig, Sharps are okay. Their sound is better. There's an equalizer, too, and all that stuff. Jamal, as-salam alaikum, my dear! How are you? - Come in! - Sit! - Jamal... - Bring us tea! The boys need a tape recorder. - You have one? - We do, we do! - Here, please, take it. - Can I have a look? Look. Hi. What the fuck did you bring him here for? - He knows how to bargain. - Really? He's shifty. You know how to bargain? No. And he does. Look, boys, a double-cassette Sharp. Cool. - I want a Panasonic. - Okay. A good model, by the way. You can place the speakers around the room. It has an equalizer, and everything! Oh, and a mike! You can send a sound letter to your girl. Like, wait for me. Your warrior is coming home, and he's not empty-handed. Take a shower, Galya! Make yourself ready! A good thingy. Well, how much? - 700. - Well, it's fair. Give me the money. No, I've only 500. I said, give me the money. Listen to me. - I'm not buying it for 700. - Shut your mouth. Do as I say. - A good device. - A fine tape recorder. Cool. Here, take it. - No need to count. 500. - 500? No, no. Wait, Jamal. Wait. That's the law! You took the money? You took the money, that's the law! - Jamal, why? Aren't we brothers? - You talked me into it. Such is the law, if he took the money. Wow good job, I'll take some more bakshish. Boy, move your ass. Guys, come here. - Yes, Sir. - Take one block. - I'll take a block of Marlboros, too! - Take it. - Here. - Alright! - I'll take the magazine, okay? - Take it. Why ask? Jamal is a good man, right? Dogfaces going all out? What are you doing, bastards? We're getting our asses kicked up in the hills while you're bargaining here? Give me a cigarette. C'mon. Thanks. What you got there? Tits magazine? Lieutenant! Please help. The special unit got to our boys. They're going to tear them to pieces. - Let me take a gander. - Good cigs. - Calm down, it's alright! - You're crazy? Hey... - A cool tape player. - Give it back. - Who's that clown? - Give 'em back the player. Or else what? - I said: give back the player. - Are you dumb or what? Andrei, may I? Go ahead. Get up! Come on, knock him out! Kill'im! Smother the bastard! Come on! Go on! Knock him out! What the hell are you doing?! You are tripping, eh. We were just wrestling. How long you've been in Afghanistan? It's my first day. You're a good fighter. You were in sports? I'm a pro Greco-Roman wrestler. I'll call you Greek then. Want to join my recon unit? I do. Attention! Turn! Do you copy? Just days left before demob. They promised - no combat. That kishlak is under Hoshem. They think they'll find the general's son there. A normal assignment. I don't give a fuck about his son. It's so beautiful here. You like it? Stay. Have you heard Sakharov's latest speech? - Whose? - Academician Sakharov's. Who is it? Good broads, fat. You know, everything is changing back home. We're telling the truth now, about the Afghan war, too. How was it on leave? Was wasted all the time. Couldn't wait to get back. Is it true that girls wear fishnet pantyhose now? - A fishnet like this! - What the fuck! How many did you bang? - I was wasted all the time. - Attention to your right! - You don't fall for chicks anymore? - Fuck you. I want to do a backstory about you! Why about me? Not about the generals, but about the honest soldiers. Did you bring a helmet? Where's your helmet? Put it on and don't take it off. Tell me the truth, how was it with chicks? - Nothing happened. - Why? You wait and wait for that leave. You come there and there's nothing to do. Why? Just because. Like you remove the color from TV. - You didn't get a hard-on? - Fuck you! Look, bro, I'll be demobbed soon, but I don't have a Dushman knife. I need it, you know. Larkov, are you completely off your rocker? Action! Go! Go! Follow me, boy. Come on! Go! Come on! Run! Move! Ready? You alive? Forward! A grenade! Go! Stay here. Lieutenant! Akhmedov, cover me! Get up! Look at me! Look with your eyes! You see me? You see me?! Or Kharlamov will kill me. Let's go. Come on, come on. Over there. - Scared? - Why are you sticking out? You're filming me or the donkey? - How are you? Alive? - Yeah. You and your close-ups on donkey. You alive guys? What, Paparazzi? Your backstory will be no good. They pinned us down like rats, and no heroism. I got to run, though... Where are you going, Larkov? Freeze! Cover him! Are you an idiot or what? You want to demob in your coffin? I went to get a knife. I'll cut your balls off with this knife. Listen, Paparazzi. Erase all that stuff about the knife. Fuck, that machine-gun will bury us here. Erase about the machine-gun, too. Bitch. Boy, cover the uppers. Good. Boy, you hungry? I can't. I'm covering. Soldier, this is an order! Come here, quick! - No, Ensign! - Don't be so brazen. Here, eat. It's good. Follow me! Sergeant! Where are you? Sergeant! Enough guzzling. Enough guzzling, I said. - What are the pillows for? - To sit my ass on the armor. That's it, boy. Keep up. Boy, come here! Finish up this bearded one. Come on. - Come on, shoot that bastard. - I can't. What do you mean you can't? Shoot! Come on, shoot, soldier! Soldier, it's an order. Go. - Come on, come on, boy! - I won't. Come on, boy! Calm down! Quiet! Calm yourself. And remember: this is life. Either he kills you, or you kill him. Got it? Ah, Lieutenant. I'm congratulating Maltsov here on his initiation. Good boy. Oh, go to hell... What? It's okay. - Your goner? - Mine. Is it your first? First. What did you lose here? - I lost my way. - Here, a trophy. - No, I don't want it. - Keep it. It's a tradition - from the first killed. What's the song? Jimmy-jimmy, acha-acha. Let's go, Lieutenant. I'd like a couple of frames more for my article. Can you knock slowly and then open it slowly? Stop! You'll be a laughingstock. Can you just open it slowly? Alive? Fucking ambush. We've lost two. The pilot is gone. Let's take it with us, Commander? What? We'll make a broth. Drop this crap! They put up a trip wire. They knew we'd come. Let's go. Drop the chickens! Major! Somebody! What? It's the pilot's. They took them to the mountains. Look, it doesn't feel like mine. It takes you years to think. A cool jacket! What's the problem? What's the problem? The problem is Hoshem controls Salang Pass and there are no leads to him. And that Tarek of yours won't help. And he won't. You know why? Because Hoshem is a Tadjik and Tarek is a Pashtun. Pashtuns will never help Tadjiks. Look, Madjed. What are you going to do after we leave? I don't know. I guess I'll go to my homeplace and merge with the folks there. That's it, let's go. A good jacket. Take it and let's go. - No, I'm not taking it. - What? - Not taking it. - Why? - Don't want it. - Wait, it's a good jacket. Why? No. To hell with it. I know him. He'll buy it for sure. For five million Afghani he'll take our troops across Salang Pass. He's a jolly man. War is a business to him. But many believe that he is not zealous enough for a warrior of Jihad. That's too bad. He has his bosses, we have our bosses. It's not gonna look good if they find out that he took our column through the gorge. So we must think of something. He doesn't need to worry. We'll think of something. Five million Afghani and my jacket. Okay. Is it a deal? It's a deal. It happens. I'll cover him. Do you mind? But why my jacket? Is there a lot of mannequins like this? A lot. But the jacket was an only one. Excuse me, please. You've got not live men in that truck. What do you mean, not live? Are they dead or what? They heard there was an order "attention", and they are exemplary men in combat and political training. Why are you filming them? You wanted to film me! Or film the hills. Aren't they beautiful! He liked the way it was arranged. They'll talk now about how many infidels he killed. He even regrets we're leaving. Ask if he has any information about Vasilyev's son. The plane hit Sardar, Hoshem's bodyguard. They had two Stingers delivered from the curator. The curator is from America. Guys, what have you done? - It's my friend. - Wait. Easy, it's Vasya. - Vasya! - He has no legs!.. Oh and my... Attach his head. Couldn't save Vasya? Come on, Vasya!.. Only two weeks left to demobbing! He owes me 13 rubles. They promised 10,000 dollars for our heads. 10,000 dollars! Good money, 10,000. Shall we give you up? That's not his hand! This is his hand! Where're his legs, guys? Larkov, Melnik, stop this circus. Burn the mannequins. Vasya's alive. He'll sit it out in the garrison, legs or no legs, Commander! Take him, you'll be his nurse. Okay. There's an arrangement with our agent. We plan to take out the division, within 2 weeks, through Salang Pass. You can't trust a Tajik. He's a cheater. - He will kill all of you. - What do you suggest? We should destroy the whole grouping with a rocket-bomb blow, and then take the division out. There're ten kishlaks here, hundreds of peaceful villagers. Tarek, enough with the killings, we should come to terms. I'm off to Kabul. Are you coming along? Hoshem has my son. You suggest that I bomb my son? Mind you, I'll be complaining to Moscow. - Even write to the Communist Party. - And I will! I will write to Gorbachev! General, Major Kolbasin reporting. - What do you have here? - Mines, General. We won't take them back home and we won't leave them to the locals. Major, everything's ready. Shall we blow it? Let me blow it, son. I've got 2 crates of canned meat. You want it? - No, I don't want. - Why did you call me then? I want a grenade launcher. - AGS-17? - Yes. One good man needs it. - A million. - No. - I'll sell it for a million. - No. - Goodbye then. - Wait! A million. I agree. Come tomorrow. I'll be waiting. Salam alaikum, dears! Open it. This is a grenade launcher AGS-17 called 'Flame'. Translate. It has a magazine case with grenades. Translate. It fucking goes as far as Pakistan. It's not even a machine, it's a shaitan tube. When you fire it, you have to press with your entire body, because it is like a mad donkey. Are they taking it or not? - What? - It's not here. Where is it? It's right before you. It's in the storage. I'll have to take it out. I'll bring you a brand-new one. No fly ever sat on it. What? - Are we taking it or not? - Yes. - A million Afghani. - We take it. - How much is here? - A million Afghani. I'll bring it in tomorrow. - This is a present for you. - We'll be waiting. Alright, goodbye. Boy, follow me. Do you really want to give them a grenade launcher? Are you an idiot? I swore an oath. Bastard. No, that's not it. What? Let's go. It's not it. Fuck, what shall I do? I've got the money, but where to hide it? What are you grinning? Ensign, let's blow it on booze? Look, rookie, if you tell anyone about the money, I'll cut your head off, bitch. You got me? I don't hear you! I got you. Moron. And this is what we need. It'll lie here for a week, and Ensign Abdasalamov will bring to the USSR the what? - A Trinitron TV set? - What? - A Sony Black Trinitron TV set. - Good boy. Hey, brother! Hello, where's Abdasalamov? He's not here. Go away. Why not here? I need him. Please, call him. I said he's not here. Go away. Why not here? I need a weapon like this. Please. Halt! Or I'll fire! Go away! Jamal, why did you call for me so late? - Let's go, my dear. - You got it? - I got it. - A Sony? - Yes, Sony. Let's go. - Black Trinitron? - Yeah, nitrol, nitrol. - Is the TV screen big enough? - Very big. - And how much is it? - Discount, discount. - Show it now. - I'll have to go back to my unit. - Here, look. Don't move, or I'll kill you. Come on, get in! Careful! Have you gone fucking mad? What is it? Who are you? Hush, hush! Put your gun away! What are you doing? C'mon, guys, what is it? Easy, easy. Quiet. Put away your gun! Where am I gonna go? Hey, who are you? - A man. - Russian? - Russian. - Officer? Soldier? What unit? Look, it has nothing to do with you. Soon it will have everything to do with all of us when they start to put out our eyes and cut off our ears. They're sadists. They want you in one piece. You cost more when you're alive and kicking. And they love money more than anything else. Don't panic. Soon they'll sell you and you'll be back. What about you? - I will run away. - Where can you run, stupid? We shall all die here. That's it, it's finished. Hey, pal, what's that you're making? - A toy boat. - What for? I wonder where that animal Sardar learned English. In London, when he was training to be an operator. - What? - A Stinger operator. Holy cow! Shitheads! Hi, Bacha! Wait. Wait. Here. A present for you. A toy boat. Take it. There's a green oak tree by the shore of the blue bay, On the oak-tree, a gold chain, The cat, learned in the fable stories, Walks round the tree in ceaseless strain. - Moves to... - Moves to the right... ...A song it groans Moves to the left - it tells a tale There're marvels there: a goblin roams Midst branches shines a mermaid's tail. How do you like it? They read Pushkin in Afghanistan! Blow! Good boy, we have a real present for you. - Come on. - Here we go. - It's for you. - Look. See? An accident again here. - Now it runs. - And you control it with this. Here, do it. - Well, you like it? - He likes it? - He confessed it? - No. He says he did it for Allah. He wanted to return the money to the mullah. - For Allah. - Yes. Dmitrich, let me talk to him. Well, talk. Madjed! Enough. Look what we can do. We can... It's like this. He says he gave the sergeant to Sardar. Sardar is engineer Hoshem's bodyguard. They have a fortified camp in the gorge. Sardar is engineer Hoshem's man. It means he can lead us to him. It's a chance, a unique chance. What? Look, our Russian brothers will build us a railroad like this, and you will be my engine driver. Leskov will show a movie in Gorband. He can arrange a meeting. They trust him. A good idea. We'll all watch movies tomorrow then. Everything's all right. He's here. Hello, Madjed. - How are you? - I'm fine. Shall we have a smoke? Today he'll deliver our proposal to engineer Hoshem. - Pilot - is expensive. - Yes, but we need them both. - He cut short our meeting. - I think he doesn't trust us. Or maybe he just wants to watch the movie. What a swell movie! I remember when I saw it for the first time. "Art Movie", there's such a cinema hall in Moscow. - There is, in Arbat place. - Yeah. It was spring and girls in short skirts were all around. And what do we have here? They are all wrapped in black rags. Nothing to look at. Oh, Madjed, the war's over, we'll go to a pub and to the movies, - and look at the girls. - You promise? I do, I swear, and we'll take Greek along. - You hear, Greek? - What? Will you go with us to a pub? Together with Dmitrich. No, he is not a pub goer. He'll go to the 'Prague' restaurant! It's round the corner. Our redhead is a pain in the arse. It's his stomach or what? Enough, Madjed. Get yourself together. You studied in Moscow? Can you tell us about it before the camera? I can. Dushmans! - Paparazzi, you alive? - My leg! I'll help. Do keep still. Greek, I'm empty. Give me ammo! - Come on! Get out! - Cover me! - Neva! I am Irtysh! - I'm Neva, go ahead! Neva! I am Irtysh! We got in an ambush in the gorge... - Copy that! - We need reinforcement. Do you copy? Over. Irtysh, copy that, in 5 minutes. 5 minutes, Irtysh. - Where are you, guys? - Sit tight. We'll pick you up. - Why aren't they firing at us? - They want us alive. - For a reward? - Someone has led them to us. No one knew about the meeting but Leskov, you and me. The Uzbek knew! The Uzbek knew. He went to see his bride. Where did he get the money? The reward. That's the answer. Boy, give me the gun! Now! What is that? You son of a bitch! What is this monster? What's going on? God have mercy on you! Hello! How are you? Friend! Were you asking for me? You son of a bitch! Sardar! Sardar! I'm sorry! Sardar! Bastard! What have you done? What is the meaning of this? Bastard! Look at him, look. - Filthy traitor! - Forgive me, Sardar! God forgives! - It's yours? - Yeah. From up there. Here. Good for you. You fired en masse. You see, the war is going to an end and I'm torn apart. I'm afraid. That I'll die here in the end. I'm not going. You're not going either. Sit. Why are you staring at me like that? Why are you pretending to be a James Bond? You came straight from London, eh. You mean you fear nothing? You do, even more than I. - Why did you come here, after all? - I came because I was scared. There, in London, I was scared. That our country is going into pieces. Scared of being useless. We're all useless. Our country doesn't need us. I came here to have it simple: here's your friend, here's your enemy. And that's all. A perfect team - two cowards. One came to Afghan because of fear, the other is afraid that the war is going to end. Let's go and be scared together. He brought a letter from Hoshem. And he brought us Parvan grapes. He knows we both like it. Wait! Take away the donkey! - What's in there? - Dmitrich, he agrees. He's sorry about yesterday's ambush and he is ready to give back the prisoners. Praised be Allah! - Are you sure? - Yes. What a ransom! It still smells of printer's ink. They'll give back your son and let the division pass. The mission must be cancelled. It's an irresponsible gamble. It's a trap! You trust engineer Hoshem? Look. Someone put it on my threshold today. This is what your new friend doing! That's how much your arrangement is worth. It's Zmarai. He helped us. We'll try to come to terms. You've been trying for 6 months, but you got nowhere. President Najibullah told me personally that the war against the mujahids will go on until the victorious end! And engineer Hoshem is one of the most adamant ones. You will leave, but the war will go on. Maybe we'd really better cancel it? It's dangerous. Let's try. I hope it will work... All right, do it. And bring back my son. Alive. What do you need the rope for? I still can work. Wash them. They'll be exchanged tonight. Why? Don't do it. Well, it's all over. Those bastards are going to kill us now. That's it, pal, it's over for us. These jerks are going to hang us. Bastards. What are you doing? Are you fucked up? Put the knife away, please! Put it away! You fool! - Are you with me? - No. - Take the knife. - Put it away! Put it away! Hey, Russian! Wash yourself... No! Stop, you fool! You'll be exchanged! What are you doing, Bacha? Cool it. We're friends, right? Friends. It's me, don't shoot! There was an accident with the pilot. He didn't know he was to be exchanged. So he tried to run away. He was killed by an 11 year old boy. No one wanted it. They couldn't find the boy. But they will find him, and give him to us. No need to find him. He'll accept only half the ransom. He has another proposal - if we stop hostilities, he'll take our troops across Salang. We agree. I need a smoke, or I'll die. It was fucking hell there. The women were ugly, uglier than donkeys. - Shall I give him more? - No, don't. Here. He wants two hostages. He will let them free when our troops cross Salang. I knew it wouldn't work. He needs guarantees that our aviation will not bomb him. I won't do it. Cancel the mission. Translate. Wait. We can't cancel the mission! Let me be a hostage. Really, I'm ready. - No, not you. - Why not? Because I forbid it. - It's dangerous. We cancel the mission. - Stop it! Stop it! There's a whole division there, a thousand men. - So I have to go there myself. - You can't go there. You're a colonel of Intelligence, head of a zonal unit. Imagine what they can do to such a big bug. And who am I? Nobody, just a common staff man. Who cares about me? - But they want two hostages. - I'll go. May I? Well, go. - What is it? Are you crazy? - If he wants to go, let him. Take his gun and the vest. It's lunacy. - Guys, anyone has a hat? - Yes, Captain. - My head is freezing. - It's lunacy! - Greek, take the cigarettes! - Thanks, I've got my own. - Have more! - No, thanks, I've got them. I shouldn't have let them go. - Where are we? - In a fairy bloody tale. You'll have your One Thousand and One Night now. It's engineer Hoshem's war camp. What are you staring at? Yes, I'm Russian. Come on, go. Disperse! I was warning you. You can't trust Hoshem. He's a treacherous and deceitful man. Why did they kill him? How will I bring him to his mother now? While it's not too late, we must start a military operation! That's the only way! He's sorry he was late. He invites you to breakfast. Let's go. Can you imagine that? It's Fadeyev's "Young Guard". - What did he say? - He says that book taught him a lot. Let's go eat. He says he studied to be a hydrologist in Minsk. And then the war began. It's easy to start a Jihad, but no one knows how to end it. That's right. They even have a detachment called "Young Guard". Can you believe it? I can. I'll go and have a smoke. Will you treat me to a cigarette? You can't get one here. Hoshem doesn't approve. What's your real name? Vitya. The first 6 months I was a prisoner here, I wanted to run away. But there's nowhere to run. - Did they beat you? - No. Engineer Hoshem came sometimes and talked to me. He explained a lot to me. Then I adopted Islam, got married, - and now I live here. - What will you do when we leave? You will leave, and engineer Hoshem will stay. You'll be with him? As long as he needs me. If you want to write to your folks in the Union, I can pass it. - No, no need. - You sure? What can I tell them? They won't understand in any case. Greek! Come here! Our units are moving! Take it all. I don't need it. Through Salang! Did we do it? It seems we did. Our people are heading out. Is it over? We go home? No, we need to wait four hours. - Why? - They want guarantees. - What is it, Vitya? - Let's go. - What? Back to the dungeon? - They'll let you out. Go. Greek! They're bombing! - Who is? - Ours. - What about us? - They forgot about us. You got deaf? You got deaf, I say? What? Me too! Blow your ears. Pinch your nose and blow your ears. When starting the Afghan revolution, we believed in the great future. Now it's better? We dreamt about a better Afghanistan. I don't understand one thing. We've arranged it with them! They let us pass. - Blow your ears, I said! - I did! Our friends promised us to fulfill these plans. Is there anyone left alive here? Don't look. Don't look, I say. Go on. Go on, I say! Don't look. Go! Go! Greek! Onward, I said! Go, I say! Go! You know what? Engineer Hoshem told me what mullahs were saying about us. They say we've come to take their wives and children. And that he used to think so too. Then he asked me why we came after all. You know, I told him I used to think we came to help build socialism... And now? Now I have no idea... A ten-year-old boy lying dead with a Stechkin gun in his hands. I don't understand: his hands are so small. How could he manage it? You know whose gun is that? The pilot's, the general's son's. The bullet went straight through. A hole in his back, a big hole... You know, as if a jar with jam was broken. I killed him. You know, Major, tell me - did I come to this war for this - to kill this boy? You came here to defend your motherland. And enough with your whining. Everything will be okay. Nothing will be okay anymore. Can you pour some more? We're out of it. Enough for you. Go get some sleep. Everything will be okay. Oh yeah. Guys, you have any booze? We've finished it, Lieutenant. Really? But why did you finish all of it? I don't know what to say, Lieutenant. Good boy. You know what... You know... It's good we're leaving, isn't it? THE USSR IS THE BASTION OF PEACE Go on, paint. Where did he go? Lieutenant! Where are you going? There're mines there! - There're mines there, Lieutenant! - Fuck it all! God likes violence! There're mines there! There're mines there, Lieutenant! Everything goes on as was decreed! Stop, Lieutenant! Everything goes on as was decreed! Go away, there're mines there! Come on! I'm here, come on! I'd love to punch your nose. But their mining sucks. Oh, go to hell. The fuck you understand. USSR, Kushka Town GLORY TO OUR MOTHERLAND! GLORY TO HER SOLDIERS! Soldiers! Ensigns, officers, thank you for your service. Unit commanders, get ready for boarding. Can you tell them not to play so loudly? There's ringing in my ears. They can only play loudly or not play at all. Shall we stop it? Let them play. Nikolai Dmitriyevich, come here. Join me at the table, I'm all alone here. Bring us borsch, son. Fill the glasses. Kindly join me. - Why did you do it? - What? What are you saying? You decided to settle accounts for your son? He was killed by an 11-year-old child. You took revenge upon a small boy? It's war, where boys die. You think it was up to me? It was an order. They called me from Moscow. There was no order to bomb Hoshem. You just decided to take vengeance. Peaceful people died. Do you realize - that's low? They said: smash them, and I did. And I would have done it again. One should start a war only if he's sure he can win. - Did we win? - We did! - We did... - But we have to leave. Because there were too many advisers like you. Well, will you drink with me? No. A soldier was coming home And saw those boys. "Who are your mothers, guys?" The soldier asked the boys My mother is anarchy, my father is a glass of port wine! They all had great jackets, They were all tall. The soldier wanted to pass them by, But it wasn't easy. - Are you crazy to drink on the square? - We're celebrating our medals, Major! Behave. Well, Greek, you drowned your order in booze? What are you going to do now? I think I'll go to the reserve. Right, the army isn't for everyone. Well, it's 16:45. Time to move out. By the way, you got a watch? Took one for you, too. Here's for you from the command. Take them. Thanks, Major. Move aside. Close it. A pretty funny joke The boys played on the soldier. They painted him red and blue And made him say profanities. Mother is anarchy, Father is a glass of port wine! Mother is anarchy... Our squadron was the last to leave Afghanistan. We burnt top-secret papers that suddenly turned not secret and useless. Madjed left to the mountains. The mujahids were already searching for him. Volodya forced Hoshem's donkey on him. He lied it was from the Command. I realized that we would never see each other again. We all died at the Afghan war. Even those who survived. It's changed people that returned to a changed country. The Soviet Union was dying together with us. We had to learn to live anew...
