[ music playing ] woman: Headed home? - [ chuckles ] that's the plan. [ both chuckle ] - heard you got a new assignment. - I did. I'm quite excited about it, to be honest. It's a unique circumstance, but those tend to be the ones the children need you the most. What about you? Back to Spain? - There are worse ways to spend the summer. And the family really is lovely. It'll be good to see the kids again. - I guess this is goodbye for a few months. - Only three. - A lot could happen in three months. - That's true. If it's not the children getting in trouble, it's us. - [ laughs ] safe travels. - You, too. [ muffled scream ] [ music playing ] [ footsteps thumping ] girl: Give it back! I said give it back! - You had your turn! - Mom! Woman: What's with all the shouting? - Mom! - She started it! - Oh, come on, guys. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on? - I was trying to have a tea party with mr. Bun, but blaine came and took him from me! - I was building a fort, and I needed him! - But did you ask jessica if you could take mr. Bun away? - No. - Blaine? - No. But I wanted him, mom! - But maybe that's not what mr. Bun wanted. It was jessica's turn. She had him. How would you feel if someone tried to take you away without your permission? - But, mom! - It's important to be considerate, little buddy. - Sorry. - Mom. - Yeah, sweetheart? - Do you really have to go? - Aw, honey, we talked about this. It's only a couple nights a week for the next couple months, and I'll be back in the morning before you even get up. You won't even know I'm gone. - Who's this lady, the one staying with us? - Well, honey, she's-- blaine: Here. - What? - There's a car in the driveway. - There is? - [ doorbell rings ] - oh. [ sighs ] okay. - Mrs. Trent? - Julia, please. And you must be... - Olivia, olivia winterbourne. - Please, come in. - Oh, I think we have an audience. - [ beep ] - julia: Oh. - This must be jessica and blaine. - I see their reputations precede them. Come say hi to mrs. Winterbourne. - Ms. - Ms. Winterbourne. - Hello. - Hi. - Don't be nervous. I'm here to keep you safe and maybe have some fun along the way. We're going to be great friends. Just wait and see. - I'm sorry. They're not usually this shy. - Oh, think nothing of it. It's a new routine. Sometimes children need time to adjust. - Speaking of time to adjust, they're not the only ones. Do you mind if we chat in private? - Of course. - Okay. Give me and ms. Winterbourne a minute to chat, okay? I've been putting on a brave face for the kids, but I have to confess I'm still having anxiety about leaving them. They've had babysitters before, but this is a bit of a unique circumstance. - What I said about the children is also perfectly natural and true for the parents, too. I'd be more concerned if you weren't nervous. - When the office announced the plan to do several overnights a week so we could work on this project in tandem with our australian branch, it felt overwhelming. After my husband passed away in the car accident, we've pretty much been on our own. But I've made do. I'm not used to asking for help. - Everyone needs help sometimes. - Thank you. Blaine: Come on! - Mom said no! - Give him to me! Mom! - What now? Hey, hey, hey. Everybody stop. I thought we already settled this, okay? Blaine, what did I tell you earlier? - She's had him all afternoon! - May I? - Eh... - What seems to be the problem? - Jessica's had mr. Bun all afternoon for a stupid tea party when I want him for my fort. - I see. I see. Jessica? - Mr. Bun wasn't done having a tea party with me. - Hmm. Well, how 'bout this? Why not both? - Huh? - You want mr. Bun for your fort, and you want mr. Bun at your tea party. - Right. - So... Why don't we have the tea party in the fort? - Yeah! - I call choosing the pillows for the fort wall. - No! Me! - As I said, you're not alone anymore. - Wow. [ chuckles ] - whoa. Mr. Bun, are you okay? I think he's had a little bit too much tea. - Thank you. And be good to ms. Winterbourne. - You ready? - For the first of many all-nighters, as ready as I'll ever be. - You'll do great. - Thanks. Were you able to check out the room - at the top of the stairs? - Yes. It's lovely. - Well, at least for the few nights a week you have to stay, it's a little sanctuary you can call your own. Speaking of, did you park your car in the garage? - I did. You're sure it's not a problem I park there? - I never use it. It's where I stored the last of my husband's things I couldn't bear to get rid of, but still not ready to see every day. It's silly to keep it empty, so someone might as well benefit from my neuroses and just park there. - [ chuckles ] of course. - Um, so we ran over the emergency numbers on the fridge. - Julia. - And today is a weekend, so we'll have to cover the routine of taking the kids to school when I get home. - Julia. - And also, blaine can tend to play a little rough. If that happens, just tell him that it's not allowed. - Julia, everything is gonna be fine. - Thank you. Well, okay, then. [ chuckles ] good luck. Okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Okay. - Oh, children! Who wants to play a game? - Oh. Your computer keys must fear you. - [ chuckles ] honestly, everyone should. So how'd it go? - Fine, I guess. I mean, it's a little weird having a stranger in your house watching your kids. - Correction. A vetted, qualified stranger. - It's true. Her references and credentials are through the roof. Not only is she a highly decorated nanny, she's also a registered foster mother. If it can be done for the kids, the woman has done it. - See? You have nothing to worry about. - I know. I know. [ sighs ] - I totally get it. I remember the first time nolan and I had to hire a nanny. I called the house, like, every 20 minutes. And then I realized they actually know what they're doing. This agency is the best of the best. That's why I recommended them. - Jessica and blaine did take to her rather quickly, which doesn't always happen. - You just have to have some faith. There's nothing to worry about... Except for that conference call with brisbane in 10. - That's tonight? - Not funny, trent. - How could I forget? Brisbane at 10:00. - Look, if you're still worried, make a plan to have a little crossover time with you and the nanny so you're both there. Maybe it'll ease your fears. I know this feels like a lot. It's happening all at once. - Yeah. - Spend an afternoon with her, and you'll see that the kids are in good hands. - Okay, I will. It's a good idea. - Right. Now let's show these aussies what we're made of, shall we? - Mm. - [ laughs ] I wish I was about stronger coffee than this. - Ah. - It's a little weak, right? - Yeah, it kind of is. - I bet you ben made it. [ mellow music playing ] [ door opens ] [ music stops ] [ gasps ] - good morning. - Hi. [ chuckles ] did you clean? - I had some extra time after I put the children to bed, so I thought I'd take it upon myself. - Olivia, you really shouldn't have. - I know how much you have on your plate, and these overnights are a big change. I just wanted to help out where I could. - And you even cleaned the kitchen? Thank you. - [ chuckles ] it was nothing, really. - It's spotless. Truly, thank you. - My pleasure. - And how were the children? Hopefully less of a disaster than the house. - You should see for yourself. [ overlapping chatter ] - you really didn't need to bring food. - Nonsense. It's my contribution. When you suggested an outing, I knew I wanted to do something. I rarely get to spend social time with the families I work with, and a day outside, I couldn't resist. - Well, thank you. Remember when life was that simple? - [ sighs ] hardly. - How's it going? With the kids, I mean. - Oh, they have been lovely. I think they've been a little restless at night, but I think they're just adjusting to you being gone still. Other than that, they've been perfect angels. - [ chuckles ] you sure you got the right kids? - [ laughs ] - well, thank you for being here. - I appreciate the invite. - You know what I mean. I know it's your job, but you always seem so present. It's admirable. And there's always so much to do, always another email to write, another bill to pay. Sometimes I feel like I'm not even there, and it's my life. - I just try to provide the family atmosphere that I myself would have wanted. - Ow. - Blaine, honey, what happened? - Ow. My knee. - Ohh. - What have I told you about playing so rough? You need to be more careful. Let me take a look. - Oh. Blaine, honey, do you want your mommy to look at your cut? I-- - it's fine. [ chuckles ] I'm glad he trusts you. - Well, you're very brave. I've got something for that. Does it sting? Okay, I'm just gonna rinse it off with some water, okay? - Jessica, blaine, mommy has to go to work! Blaine, come give mommy a hug before she has to leave. - Blaine? - Is everything okay? - I think so. I've been calling for blaine, but he's ignoring me. Are they playing hide-and-seek or something? - I wouldn't take it personally. He's probably still raw from when you scolded him at the park. You know how temperamental children can be. - [ sighs ] it was for his own good. He needs to be more careful. - Do you want me to talk to him? - No, no, it's fine. You said they've been temperamental. He's probably just a little cranky. Maybe get them in bed a little early tonight? - Of course. - Thank you, olivia. I don't know what I'd do without you. [ door opens ] [ door closes ] - oh, children, who's ready for a game? - [ whispering ] how did "nanny's big day out" go? - Honestly, it was pretty great. The kids adore her. They might even like her more than me. - Ooh. Do I detect a note of jealousy? - Maybe a little. - [ chuckles ] oh, jules, that's just how kids are. They're just excited because she's new. - Yeah, I know, I know. Just reserving my right as a mom to feel a little wounded. - Trust me. When they're teens, you're gonna be ecstatic when they give you a moment to yourself. - [ chuckles ] - I'm glad you're feeling better, though. - Me, too. It was good to spend the day with her, - see her with the kids. - Yeah. Julia: Honestly, I don't know what I was so afraid of. [ door creaks ] [ car pulling up ] [ door creaks ] [ door closes ] - can I help you? - Oh, yes. My apologies for calling on you at such a late hour. Are you julia trent? - I'm not. I'm her nanny. I'm afraid ms. Trent isn't home right now. Could I ask what this pertains to? - May I speak to you inside? - Regarding? - I'm with the agency. - I see. Right this way. I don't think I caught your name. - Elle davies. And you are? - Olivia winterbourne, but, if you're from the agency, you knew that. - Indeed. - Charmed. You said there was something you wanted to discuss? - May we? - I think, in deference to the homeowner, we've gone far enough. Ms. Trent wouldn't want a stranger in her home. - Is that so? - House rules. - As you wish. Regular check-ins with the agency are customary, as I'm sure you're aware. We've received none from this household. - Things have been rather hectic as of late, getting the children to acclimate-- - what's more, a dear friend of yours, marta martinez, had grown concerned because she'd not heard from you, so she reached out. You know how marta can be. - Yes, of course - naturally, the lack of communication caused some concern, so I took it upon myself to stop by. - Well, as you can see, everything's fine. It was all just a case of miscommunication. - Of course. Arriving tonight to find the house had a nanny, as you can imagine, was a surprise, considering the lack of response. - Well, I'm here. The children are tended to, so there's really no more need for concern. I'm glad we were able to clear that all up. - Yes... Absolutely reassuring. Except for one small detail. I know olivia winterbourne... And you are not her. I don't know who you are or what you're playing at, but I will be calling the authorities. I suggest you leave this house at once. - You first. Jessica: Olivia! What was that? I heard a noise! - Nothing, honey! I just dropped a plate! Everything's fine! Go back to bed! - Okay. - [ whispering ] everything's fine. - Hello, everybody! Good morning. The kids still not up? - Still sleeping, but I knew you'd be home soon, so I thought I'd whip you up some pancakes. You must be so hungry after a full night's work. - Thanks, but that's a bit weird. That's not like them. I should probably go wake them up. I told blaine I'd help him with his math homework, so I should probably get to it before I get too tired. - Maybe let them sleep just this once. They were up late. - What do you mean, they were up late? - Well... I'm not quite sure how to say this. I don't want you to think poorly of me, but I promised I wouldn't tell. - Wouldn't tell? Wouldn't tell what? - Well, last night, while I was tidying up the kitchen, I heard some loud music. I wandered into the tv room and found the children had snuck out of bed. They found a scary movie. - What? They know they're not supposed to watch tv without supervision, let alone after bedtime. Jessica! Blaine! - Please, julia. I promised them that I wouldn't tell. - They're children, olivia. We don't need to make promises to them when they've been disobedient. - I know, I know, but they punished themselves. They so badly wanted to watch that scary movie, but then it scared them, and they couldn't sleep. They were up half the night trying to calm down. I am certain that they learned their lesson, and it won't be happening again. - That may be, but I still ought to talk to them. - They made me promise. They were scared that you'd be mad. - That's astute of them, because I am. - I understand, but also, as their nanny, it is essential that I establish a rapport of trust with them. If we let this one go, you and I can work better in tandem watching them in the future. - I don't know. I-- - trust me on this. - Fine. Okay. [ sighs ] maybe it's just because I'm exhausted, but I'll let this one slide. But, in the future, don't let them manipulate you, okay? You know how kids can be. Give 'em an inch, and-- - you don't have to worry. I'm not so easily tricked. Now... Eat up. - [ chuckles ] this looks great. [ music playing ] [ children bickering ] - you had it Monday! - It's my turn! - It's my turn! - Nanny: Children, please. Your mother's trying to sleep. - Sorry. - Bless that woman. [ yawns ] did I really sleep all day? - Indeed, you did. - Wait. Did you stay here all day? Oh, olivia, I'm so sorry. You could have just woken me up. - Hush. You needed your sleep. - Oh, but I missed all day with the kids. I was supposed to help blaine with his homework. - Actually, we just finished up. - [ sighs ] olivia, you really shouldn't-- - julia, you needed the sleep. - But these things you're doing with the kids, that's my job. I really shouldn't be sleeping through the day and missing time with my children. - I think it should be allowed just this once. After all, you weren't the only one who needed rest they needed catching up on. - So what'd you guys do today? That good, huh? Really? Nothing to say? [ sighs ] blaine: Went outside today. It smelled. - Outside smells? You sure you kids aren't just watching too much tv and forgot the scent of fresh air? Blaine: No. It's stinky. - Stinky? Stinky how? - Oh, well... When blaine was telling me about how stinky it was out there, I went and had a look. It appears an alley cat... You know, by the garage. I was gonna deal with it after I put them to bed tonight. - Oh. No, really? [ chuckles ] maybe I should go have a look. - [ cellphone rings ] - oh. - [ ring ] - [ yelps ] - [ ring ] - okay. [ ring ] oh, it's rebecca. Oh. Hey, rebecca. Is that what time it is? Oh, god, I'm gonna be late. I-- - I've got it. Don't worry about it. - Thank you, truly. [ groans ] bye, kiddos. [ door opens ] [ door closes ] [ music playing ] - time to go. - That's your third cup of coffee tonight. How are you not bouncing off the walls? - I've no idea. I'm having a hard time even keeping my eyes open. I didn't think this reverse schedule would have such an effect on me. - Maybe you just need to eat something. - Mm, that could be it. Last thing I had were pancakes that the nanny made for me this morning. After that, I just zonked out. - That long ago? Sure hope they were damn good pancakes. I'll tell you what. Why don't we hit the vending machine and get you a midnight snack? - Yes, perfect. - Mm, hopefully that'll set you straight. - Eh, being a little tired isn't the worst. I'm sure there are other people tonight that are far worse off than me. - Hmm. - [ grunting ] [ panting ] this family is mine. Sweetie, it's time to get up. - [ moans ] - yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Is it time for another game? - Yes. It's a good one tonight. Bring mr. Bun. He likes this one. Come on. Wake up, sleepyheads. Blaine: What game tonight? - [ gasps ] remember the game that we played a few nights ago, whispers? - I'm not sure I want to play that one again. - It's a game that little boys and girls have been playing for a long time, and you wanna make sure that you're good at it in case you have to play with friends, right? - Right. - Right. - Do you remember how to play? We all whisper a secret to each other, a different secret for each person, and then we share all the secrets that we heard, and we try to guess which secret belongs to who. - But if it's a secret, shouldn't we not tell? - That's why the secret never leaves the circle. You must never share what you hear in a game of whispers. But that's part of the fun. Understand? I'll go first. [ whispering ] I married my dog. [ both laugh ] - [ whispering ] I don't like jelly beans. - [ gasps ] - [ whispering ] jessica doesn't like jelly beans. - [ laughs ] [ whispering ] I sneeze when I see a cat. [ both laugh ] - don't forget to tell mr. Bun. [ laughs ] do you have one for mr. Bun? Okay, okay. I think we've heard enough. Who's ready to hear some secrets? - Me! - Me! - Well, I heard that somebody here doesn't like jelly beans. - That's jessica. - Nuh-uh! - [ laughs ] what did you guys hear? - I heard someone here sneezes when they see cats! - [ gasps ] oh! Guilty! - [ laughs ] - [ sneezes ] - [ gasps ] bless you. Did you see a cat? - No. - [ laughs ] I heard a very serious secret. Someone said that they heard mommy talking on the telephone with her friend... And that she's thinking about leaving us for good. Anyone? Now, children, remember, just like the last time one of these serious secrets came up, if no one admits that it's their secret, we have to move on. - But if mommy doesn't love us anymore and leaves... - I'll still be here, sweetheart. - Can't we just ask mommy? - That's against the rules. - Jessica's right, and rules are very important. Following them is what separates the good children from the bad. Now, who's ready for some more secrets? - Are you sure you don't want me to join you? - No. I finally have the weekend off. It'll be good for me to spend some quality with the kids. - I really don't mind. - With no disrespect intended, I do. I need this. I've barely been able to see jessica and blaine all this week, and, even when I'm home, I can't seem to shake my exhaustion. I feel good today. I just want to get out and be with them. They deserve it. So do I. - Yes, of course. - Enjoy your weekend. You have gone above and beyond. You've earned this. - Thank you. - Hey. Any big plans? - Nothing major. Just gonna tie up some loose ends that I didn't get a chance to handle before I left for this job. - Ah. Well, you do that. I'm sure you'll feel much better once you get everything squared away. I know I always do. All right, kids. Come say goodbye. - [ chuckles ] - do you have to go? - Stay! - It's just for the weekend. I'll be back before you know it. Blaine: Don't go. - Just for a little while, and now you get to spend time with your mom. We talked about mom time, right? Right? Right? [ laughs ] it's important. Have fun, okay? Have fun. [ chuckles ] you know how kids are. - Like having your own little community theater right here inside the house. [ chuckles ] - have fun. I'll see you tomorrow night. - Get some rest. - Easier said than done. - [ blows lips ] all right, gang. What do you say we get out of this stuffy old house and go for a fun Saturday at the park? I think we could all use a little sunshine. What do you think? - [ grunts ] - ehh. - Okay. Well, don't everybody all get excited at once. [ blows raspberry ] come on. It'll be fun. Are you guys hungry? I brought a whole lot of snacks. - No. I'm not hungry. - Are you sure? Blaine?! What's that about? I wish you guys would talk to me. - Mommy. - Yes, baby? - When's olivia coming back? [ door opens ] nanny: Hello? [ running footsteps ] - olivia! - You're back! - Is everything okay? I came as soon as I got your message. - I don't know. They were just asking for you. I didn't know what else to do. They weren't acting themselves. I'm sorry to cut into your personal time. - Nonsense. This is what nannies are for. - Sure. - [ sighs ] you seem tired. Maybe trying to do a big outing after all those overnights was more taxing than you thought? - No, I don't think that's-- - you just go and relax. I'll bring you a snack. Your worries are over. Olivia is here. [ chuckles ] how was it? Jessica: Not fun. We don't want to be here. Blaine: Yeah, we don't want to be with her. - We want to be with you. - Shh. - I... - Children, can you give your mother and I a moment, please? - I heard them, olivia. I want to know what's going on. - Julia... What you heard, no mother wants to hear. But it's surely something we've all said to our own parents at one point or another. - I don't understand. - Come. Drink. Nothing is going on. What you heard, that is just kids being kids. - My kids just said they didn't want to see me. - You know what it was like to be young. Did you always get along with your mother? - [ sighs ] when I was a teenager, we used to fight terribly. [ chuckles ] I was such a headache for her. - I'm sure you were. This is perfectly natural. They've been alone with you for so long, they're just latching on to something new. It's a phase. They're your kids. They love you. - I know. - Of course. As a nanny, I see this all the time. They'll come around once you get back to a regular schedule. - Thanks. - You feel better? - Not really. [ chuckles ] - get some rest, huh? - I will. Thanks. [ sighs ] [ blaine mutters ] [ laughs ] beep beep. Can you go any slower in this thing? - What are you guys doing? - You're right. It's too intense. [ both laugh ] - don't break him. - This is her favorite toy. - Here, you be him, and beat him up. - Oh, no. [ children laughing ] jessica: Mr. Bun is now in the action. He was crushing. [ toys clatter ] nanny: Bear says nummy. - No, bear. - No. - [ laughs ] - nanny: That's vulgar. - Oh, my god. You guys look terrible. What's going on? - Do you have-- - don't. - Hey! - I said don't! - Blaine! I-- - [ sighs ] - ow! - [ mutters ] ow. - [ gasps ] - [ sighs ] - I'll go make sure he's okay. Nanny: It's okay. It's just a little ding. You're gonna be... - Blaine? - Want mr. Bun to kiss it? [ kissing ] it's all better. [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] you're gonna be okay. He'll be okay. A little bruised, but fine. - He's fine? He's far from fine. Have you even seen the children today? - Yes. They seem to have caught some sort of bug, nothing that a bit of tea and rest can't fix. - A bug? They're pale and exhausted. They need to go see a doctor. - I really don't think that's necessary. They just caught a cold that's going around. Honestly, I'm surprised you haven't caught it yourself, what with your unusual hours. I know you've been having trouble waking up as it is. Maybe what everyone needs is just some extra rest. - I still would prefer a doctor visit. - I'm just thinking of you. I know, with your current schedule, you can't spare the time. [ chuckles ] I will personally see to it that they are in bed early tonight, and, if they're ill still in the morning, I will drive them to the doctor myself. - I think that's something I should do. - Nonsense. That's why I'm here. If they're sick, there's no sense worrying yourself ill as well trying to figure things out. I've got everything covered. - I'm sure you do. - There was a server meltdown with the melbourne office last night, and they didn't get that spreadsheet you uploaded. Can you resend it? - Mm. Mm-hmm. - Hello? Earth to julia? - Huh? Huh? - Spreadsheet, melbourne? Did you hear anything I just said? - Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I-I'll get it to you a.S.A.P. - Great. Is everything okay? - Honestly, no. Can we talk? - Sure, of course. What's on your mind? - Not what, who. Now, the kids, they look like death warmed over. They won't even let me come near them just to see how they're feeling. It's like this whole thing has been escalating-- the scary movie, the park, and now this? It's like she's-- like she's causing it, almost. Is that crazy? - Can I be honest? - Please. - Of course they're gonna be tired. Kids like routine. A change this big is going to impact them for a while, and that's okay. And you're allowed to feel crazy. You're a mom. What I think is happening here is just you're being a little too much of a mom, if you catch my drift. - I don't. - Right. Okay, how do I put his delicately? Since lucas died, you've been a one-woman show. Every step, every decision with these kids has fallen on you and you alone, and that's a lot of pressure. I think you just forgot how to relinquish control. - Wait. Are you trying to say that you think I'm feeling this way 'cause I'm overprotective? - I mean... Y-yeah. - [ scoffs ] - but not that that's a bad thing! Listen, jules, kids are rebellious. Kids get sick. Kids don't get along with their mom sometimes. That's just life. It doesn't mean there's some nefarious evil interfering. It just means they're growing up. - I don't know. This feels different. It's not just me being type a. - Trust me, babe, it's not. These people from the agency, they're professionals. They would never be cleared to work with children if they were bad people. Caring for children, okay, perhaps a little too much, is what they do. It's what we hire them to do. - I just--I don't... - It's gonna be okay. I promise you. Just breathe. Relax. I'm here if you need to talk to me, but listen to me when I tell you this. There is nothing to worry about, okay? Feel better? - Uh... - Little bit? - Yeah. - Okay, good, 'cause we have a vast amount of work to do, so let's go. - I'll be right behind you. - Okay. - [ sighs ] - care & care alike nannying agency. How may I direct your call? - Yes, I currently have one of your nannies in my employ. I just wanted to get a little more information about her. - A background check and references should have been provided at the time of engagement, ma'am. - Yes, they were. I just was curious if I could get any further information. - I can't guarantee I can help you, but what's the name of the nanny? - Her name's winterbourne, olivia winterbourne. - Oh, then you're very lucky, ma'am. Ms. Winterbourne is one of the agency's most highly rated au pairs. She's been with us for years and is in very high demand. - I see. And if I had any further questions about her methods or history? - I assure you, ms. Winterbourne is one of the most caring people with whom I've ever had the pleasure of working. Any issues you need to discuss, you can do so with her. - Okay, thanks. I will. - Thank you. Have a nice day, and thank you for trusting your family to care & care alike. - [ sighs ] where are the children? - Napping, I think. - Again? This isn't normal, olivia. Napping every once in a while, fine, but this isn't like them. I don't think they're getting better. I'm gonna go talk to them. - Julia, I think you're letting yourself get concerned over nothing. Kids sleep late sometimes. That's completely-- - don't tell me it's perfectly natural, olivia. These are my kids. I know them. I'm gonna check in on them. [ cellphone ringtone ] hello. - Ms. Trent, this is samuel grady, the principal at jessica and blaine's school. - Oh, yes, of course, mr. Grady. To what do I owe this call? - Uh, well, I'm not quite sure how to put this, ms. Trent, but I've been speaking with several of blaine and jessica's teachers lately, and, well, there's been some concerns. - Concerns? - Well, it appears that the children are slipping a bit in their schoolwork lately. They appear to be a bit sluggish. In one instance, jessica even fell asleep in the middle of class. - I can assure you this is not the norm. The kids are just having trouble acclimating to a new... - Yes. We've been made aware of your new schedule at home, and, after speaking with the children, it seems that it's not only jeopardizing their sleep, but their schoolwork as well. Blaine even shared with one of his teachers that you've been too tired to help him with his homework lately? - Well, yes, that's-- it's true, but-- - ms. Trent, we come across all kinds of situations here. It's not our business to offer commentary and-- but when the children's health and education seem to be jeopardized by these situations, we have no choice. - What are you suggesting? - Well, I'm not suggesting anything, nor am I making any accusations, but I am gonna need you to come in to the office so we can have a more thorough discussion on the matter of how we could all help with jessica and blaine. - A meeting? With my work schedule, I don't know when or how I-- - ms. Trent, I-- I don't know what to say. I just hope you can figure it out for your children's sake and your own. - I understand. Thank you. You heard that? - I did. - I've been telling you the kids are sick, that they've been withdrawing, and you've been making excuses. And now I get a call from the school with concerns? This isn't made up, olivia. - No, it isn't, and you're right. I have been making excuses... For you. - What? - Your new schedule has you completely derailed, julia. You can barely get out of bed. When you're home, you're sleeping, and, if you're not, you're inattentive and exhausted. - Now, wait just a minute. - Your exhaustion is preventing you from being present, and it's making your children despondent. Your attempts at social time with them have been a disaster. And your promises to help them with their schoolwork have gone unfulfilled. Everything is changing because of your inability to deal with your present circumstances. - No. Everything has changed since you arrived. And maybe it's time you should think about going. - I don't think so. The children need me, especially now. And, if you try to force me out, I'll have no choice but to notify my higher-ups at the agency or child protective services. It's for the sake of the children and you. - Are you threatening me? - It's not a threat. It's a fact. And who are they gonna believe? The woman with the erratic schedule that's making her sleep-deprived, making her make baseless accusations... Or the woman that is keeping her house and children together? Now, if that's all, I'm going to get back to my job tending to your children, because that's what I'm here to do for you. You're welcome. - Hello. I'd like to report a crime. [ music playing ] [ blaine imitating car ] [ no audible dialogue ] [ doorbell rings ] jessica: Who's that? - I don't know. Jessica: Maybe it's a surprise. - Maybe. Hello. Can I help you? - Sorry to bother you, ma'am. I'm officer stevens. This is officer cohen. We're from the local precinct, and, uh, we're just doing a routine visit. Uh, there's been some disturbances reported in the neighborhood, and, uh, we're just stopping by to talk to some of the folks that live here to see how everything's going. - What kind of disturbances? - Uh, loud noises, vandalism, some scratched-up cars. Probably some punk kids, but we're just trying to be thorough and see if there's anything that we missed. - I see. - So would it be okay if we, uh, came in and chatted with you for a little bit? - I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that, officer. I'm just the nanny, and I don't know if the homeowner would be pleased if I let anyone into her home without permission. - And I totally respect that. I'm not trying to make you do anything that you're not comfortable doing. We're just trying to be thorough. To be honest, um, I'm not too keen on being in the business of shaking down nannies. - [ chuckles ] - though I admit it would be much nicer to talk to fine folks such as yourself than, uh, a dangerous criminal any night of the week. Just kind of makes our job easier. - Flattery suits you, officer. - It's just a few questions? - Yep. - Well, then, I guess it can't hurt to have you come in for a few minutes, especially if it makes your nights easier. - Thank you. Have you heard or seen anything at all out of the ordinary in the neighborhood of late, ma'am? - No. I don't think so. - Okay. Is the, uh, homeowner readily available? - I am afraid ms. Trent is at work for the evening. It's just me and the kids. - Oh. Those kids? - Yeah, speaking of the devils. Jessica, blaine, this is officer stevens, officer cohen. They're just doing their job, trying to keep us all safe. - Are you looking for bad guys? - No, no. No bad guys tonight, little lady, but I tell you what. If we find any, we'll keep 'em real far away from you guys. How's that? So what are you guys getting into tonight? Staying out of trouble, I hope? - Uh-huh. We've been being good. We've just been playing with our toys. We tried to get olivia to play, but she was reading her book. - [ chuckles ] - oh, is that so? - After a long day, the children need to play their way, and I need to play mine. Maybe officer stevens wants to see your toys. - Will you show him? - Yeah. Ow! - Hey, what's the matter, little man? - My arm hurts. - May I? - Ooh. What happened? - It's okay, sweetie. - Mommy was trying to talk to me in the kitchen, and I fell. - You fell? - It was my fault, though. I wanted mommy to leave me alone, and I slipped. - Hmm. - I was in the other room, so I didn't see what happened. I do know ms. Trent was trying to get blaine's attention. It surely was an accident. - I see, yes. - Ms. Trent loves her children. Her long hours have been spreading her quite thin, but I know she'd never do anything to hurt them. - No, of course, of course. What about you, little lady? What do you think of mommy's work? - I don't know. She got in a fight with principal grady today. He thinks that her work is making us tired. - Could I get you officers anything? Tea? Coffee? - No, no. We--we should be pushing off. You guys be good, okay? Listen to your nanny. - Okay. - Okay. - [ chuckles ] - thank you. I-I'm really sorry for barging in again. - Oh, it's no bother. Stevens: Have a good night. - You, too. Drive safe. [ lock clicks ] [ chuckles ] [ cellphone rings ] [ ring ] - hello. - Ma'am, hi. It's officer stevens, uh, following up from your call earlier. - And? What did you find out? She didn't know I-I asked you to check up on her, did she? - Okay, one-- one question at a time. No. No, ms. Winterbourne does not know that I stopped by the house at your insistence. Now, in domestic matters, we frequently mask our visits as routine check-ins. I even waited a respectable amount of time after you left so as to not draw suspicion that it was you who called. She let me in willingly. - And? - And I could find no immediate evidence of wrongdoing on the nanny's part. - [ sighs ] then you must not have been there long enough. Th-there's something going on in the house. I know it. The kids, they-- they haven't been themselves. They've been tired a-and distant and... - Look, I don't think I need to remind you, ms. Trent, that I still have yet to write up my police report on tonight's findings. - [ sighs ] thank you. - Your son had bruises all over his arms, bruises that he said he got with you. - That... That was an accident. I-- he fell. - All right, well, that may be, but your daughter also indicated trouble at school related to your home situation. Independently, those two things could be coincidence, but, together, they have our attention, all right? Now, I advise you to take stock of what's important. Everyone in your home seems to think that this new work schedule of yours is making you erratic. You'd best make sure that it's not to the detriment of anyone's safety, all right? - Officer, I-- - look, you have a good, kind woman watching over your kids, all right? The only handle that you need to get on this situation is that of yourself before it compromises the safety of you and your children. Now, I was happy to stop by, check on the house for you, but, look, trust me when I say this. If we see each other again, you won't be happy. - [ crying ] [ footsteps thumping ] - mommy? - [ gasps ] - what were you doing? - Oh. Honey, I was just looking for mints. All that coffee at work made my mouth feel yucky. But I should have asked her. Care for some breakfast, sweetie? - Okay. - There you go. - Oh. - Mommy! - Hey. [ chuckles ] oh, boy. What's gotten into you two? - Maybe they're just happy to see their mother. - I guess so. - I told you they'd be feeling better in no time. - Can I have some yogurt? - Right. Uh, yes, you can. [ chuckles ] what you guys been up to? Jessica: Playing games. We have games. - Hmm, sounds like fun. [ music playing ] - what you doing? - You won't like it. - I usually don't. Spill. - Do you know what triazolam is? - No, can't say that I do. - Yeah. I didn't either, but I just looked it up. It's a sedative, a sleep aid. - I didn't know you were having trouble sleeping. - I'm not. Remember I was telling you I was having suspicions about my nanny? - Mm-hmm. - I found that medication in her purse. - Jules, you didn't! - Yeah, I kind of did. I think she's been using it to dose me so I look negligent with the kids. I'm telling you, rebecca, something is going on, and I know none of you want to believe me, but I feel it. I just-- I need proof, and I think this is it. - Are you hearing yourself? - I know how it sounds, rebecca. Okay, but something is going on inside my house. I-I don't know how to describe it, but... I've seen it. - What you've seen is your kids having mood swings. You yourself even said they were feeling better. - She's doing something. I know it. - Okay, julia... You're scaring me... And you need to stop. - There's something there, bec! She--she's hiding something! And every time I try to interfere, she--she gets in my way! Sh-she has the cops thinking that the bruise on blaine was my fault, and-- - bruise? - It was an accident. - What were the cops doing there to begin with? - I asked them to check up on her after she threatened to call c.P.S. On me. - What? - The kids' school called with concerns for their well-being, and olivia tried to say that it was my fault, okay? And... Just, rebecca, you-- you have to listen to me. - This is insane. You're spying on her, creating delusions. This--this is dangerous behavior for you and for your kids. I can't listen to this anymore. - Rebecca! - Your kids were sick, and they got better. That woman is doing her best to take care of them for you... In spite of you. Let it go. It's starting to turn out that the only bad guy here is you. - Rebecca. You have to listen! - [ sighs ] [ sighs ] oh, god, julia, forgive me. I need to speak to someone, please. [ car engine rumbling ] [ doorbell rings ] - my god. Stop right there, ma'am! - What's going on? What's happened with my kids? - Well, ms. Trent, my name is patricia fisher. I'm with child protective services, and that's exactly what I intend to find out. - I still don't know what's happening. - You are currently under investigation for allegations that suggest you may be fostering an emotionally and physically dangerous home environment for your children. - Are you serious? What about her? This all began when she arrived! - I've only ever wanted the best for ms. Trent and her children. - [ scoffs ] the best? My children have been sick and distant since you got here! You're doing something. I don't know how, but I know. It's you. - Now, julia, I have no doubt that, in your mind, this began with the arrival of your nanny. Perhaps, uh, relinquishing some measure of control, uh, was just too much for you. But, in the time since olivia has arrived, the only one with a bad track record is you. - Now, wait just a minute. - On a routine visit to your home, officer stevens discovered bruising on your son that he claims was caused by interaction with you. True or false? - Well, yes, but that was a misunderstanding. - Your kids and ms. Winterbourne both suggest you've had an increased sense of lethargy and mood shifts lately. - It's a sleep aid that-- a sleep aid. She has some in her purse, okay? I-I don't know why, and I don't know how, but she must be using them to drug me. It explains why I can't wake up and-- - you admittedly invaded ms. Winterbourne's privacy and went through her purse, an incident which is corroborated by your own daughter and which you quite literally have just confessed to yourself. - Maybe I was wrong, but why does she have such heavy sedatives on her? - I have problems sleeping and sometimes need a sleep aid. That's not a crime. - You don't need to justify yourself, ms. Winterbourne. It isn't your behavior that's being called into question here. - You don't understand, okay? Everything's different since she got here. Something's wrong. I know it. Have you even bothered checking into her background yourselves? - We have. She has all the proper paperwork and credentials from the agency. - It's as I said. Her behavior has continued to deteriorate. She's increasingly suspicious, and she has been aggressive with her children. - What? How dare you?! - She's attacking me! - Wait right there! - I've seen enough! For the time being, I'm going to suggest that ms. Trent is relieved of custody of her children until a full investigation can take place. - What? - Although this separation is temporary, for the duration of the investigation, it is suggested that ms. Trent and her children be separated immediately. - What? No. Y-you can't do this! - I have to. Action must be taken immediately. - What about the children? Where will they go? - Due to the lack of immediate family, they will be placed under the care of their nanny. - No. No, this is insane. You ca-- - it would be my honor and duty to watch the children while ms. Trent gets the help she needs. - You can't do this! - Officers! - You can't make me leave my children! - Get her now! Officers, now! - You can't--jessica! - Officers! - Blaine! - Now! - Let me say goodbye to my babies. - No! I won't go! - Okay... - You can't make me leave my children! - Officers, now! - Jessica! Blaine! - Officers... - Julia: Come to mommy! - [ door closes ] [ music playing ] [ cameras clicking ] patricia: Could we not have them here, please? Are you sure you have somewhere to go? - I'll figure it out. - Remember, for the duration of this investigation, you are not to have any interaction with your children. - You can't do this. - For the sake of your children, I have to. - Don't worry, children. Everything's gonna be fine. I've got you now. - [ screams ] - olivia. - Jessica, darling, were you hungry? I was about to make you and blaine a snack. - No. I was just wondering. Is mommy gone because we didn't tell her the secrets from the game? - [ gasps ] oh, sweetie, no. Mommy's gone because of the secrets in the game, not because you didn't tell. - Is she ever coming back? - I don't know, sweetheart. I know it's hard, but you're not alone. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. Now, why don't you go and play. Take your mind off things, and I will cook you something yummy. - Hey. - What do you want? - You can't be here. - They kicked me out of my house, rebecca. And what? I'm being fired now, too? - Julia. - Please. I don't have anywhere else to go. You saw to that. - I understand you're upset. I get it. But I did this because I care about you and the kids. - They took my kids from me, rebecca. - [ sighs ] I had to tell somebody. Your behavior was getting out of control. You need to get help. - No. What I needed was for you to listen. I know my kids, and I know my home, and something terrible is happening there. - This is exactly what I'm talking about, jules. You are sounding insane. - How dare you? [ scoffs ] - anything else, doc? - No, that'll be all. You can head out. I'll lock up behind me. - Good night. - Night. Julia trent. - Hello. - Hi. Is this the trent residence? - Mm-hmm. - My name is dr. Sheridan, and I wanted to speak-- - children, who wants to go on a little trip? [ cellphone rings ] [ ring ] [ ring ] - hello. - Ms. Trent? I need to speak with you. It's a matter of some urgency. - Who is this? - You don't know me. My name is dr. Sheridan, and we need to meet. I have some information about your nanny. - So you said you had information about olivia? - Yes. As I said on the phone, I'm a psychologist, and I tend to treat patients that have more unique profiles. I know olivia, and she's not who she claims to be. When I saw that photo, I recognized that woman immediately. She's a former patient of mine, and the details of your story caused me instant alarm. Her name is not olivia winterbourne. Her name is maxine griggs, and she's extremely dangerous. - You need to listen to me very carefully. Dr. Sheridan: Wounds from her past... - [ car horn honks ] - were deep and lasting. She was unable to have children of her own. This pushed her to a breaking point. She yearned for what she couldn't have. She's exceptionally clever, frequently unpredictable. She is obsessed with the idea of family. Now that she has one, she'll do whatever it takes to keep it. - Jessica! Blaine! [ gasps ] oh, my god. - Isn't that kind of snooping exactly what got you in this mess? You shouldn't be here. - I could say the same for you, maxine. - I see you met the good doctor. - Where are the kids? - They're upstairs packing. I told them we were gonna take a little trip. I was hoping to be gone before sheridan got involved and you came back, but you do have a bad habit of interfering with my plans. - You monster. It's over. - Maybe... For you. Stay right where you are. - What do you think you're doing? - I know exactly what I'm doing. Allow me to enlighten you. The enraged mother, already in poor mental health, was driven to madness by the separation from her children and broke into the house in one final bid to prove her paranoia true. But luckily, the nanny, in a moment of self-defense, stopped her, saving the children in the process. Sound okay to you? - You're insane. - No. This world is insane. All I ever wanted was a family of my own to love, and they told me that I couldn't have it! How is that fair? What kind of world denies a person the chance to give love?! [ footsteps thumping ] - [ sniffles ] - mommy? - Mommy came back, and she was coming to get you and hurt you, just like the secret game said, but I stopped her. - No. No, that's not true. Mommy would never hurt you, never. Whatever olivia told you, that was a lie. She's been pretending to be someone else. She's a bad, bad lady. - Wait a minute. I never told olivia that mommy was going to hurt us. That wasn't my secret. Blaine: It wasn't mine either. - She made us stay up. - And then she made us sleep after mommy thought we were sick so she wouldn't know. - Oh, my god. - Okay, you caught me. - Face it, olivia-- or whoever you are. Your plan is unraveling. - Is it? It's your word against mine. You haven't been looking so good lately. - I'm not the only one who knows your secret now. Sheridan called the police, and so did I. So what are you gonna do now? Maxine: I'm gonna do what I always do... Improvise. [ thudding ] [ gasps ] no. - Jessica? - Blaine? - Blaine: Mom! - No. [ groans ] no. What are you doing? - You forced my hand. This isn't at all how I envisioned things going. I needed a moment to think. - If you hurt them, I swear-- - hurt them? All of this has been for them! I love these children! They were going to help me have the family that I was denied! - You're crazy. - No, what's crazy is a mother who willingly leaves her children for night on end for a job! You're taking for granted something precious. You don't deserve them. These children deserve a place and a mother who's always there, unlike my own... Unlike you! - Parents provide for their children, olivia, which means sometimes they have to work. Nobody wants to leave their kids. Sometimes they have to so they can do what's best for them. - You didn't appreciate them! [ scoffs ] people like you never do. I just needed time to condition them to realize that I was the right choice. - You're sick. - But you had to go and ruin that. And now I don't have time to do this my way, to do it right. Which is why, my dear julia... You've got to go. - [ grunting ] [ grunts ] - mom? - Mom! - [ gasps ] - [ sighs, gasps ] - mommy. - Mom. Mommy. - Okay. [ sighs ] mommy's here. It's over. - [ door bangs open ] - police! [ police dispatch chatter ] - are you okay? I'm so sorry. - We're fine. [ siren approaching ] she's over there. - Over where? - There. Where did she go? - There's a lot of blood here. She couldn't have gotten far. - [ police dispatch chatter ] - [ siren approaching ] [ music playing ] [ door creaks ] - hello. - Are you mrs. Clayton? I'm elle davies. I understand you're in need of a nanny. - Oh, yeah, actually. Come on in. [ chuckles ]
