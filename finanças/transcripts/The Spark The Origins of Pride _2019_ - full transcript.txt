It's a type of cancer. Its characteristic: it only affects gay men and in particular those who take stimulants. The LGBT cause remains quite unknown. It is linked to sexuality and so it is considered as something dirty. I breaks God's law. Do not forget Sodom and Gomorrah. It goes beyond sexuality. It is first and foremost a love story. The prohibition of homosexuality resulted in a large social reprobation. We're here to fight against this marriage that will destroy families. When you belong to a minority, when you face discrimination, sometimes humour is a weapon. It seems rather easy to repress some emerging feeling of homosexuality and to restore the individual, to make him or her normal. Meeting is very hard, There are few gay establishments in Paris, in the seventies. It's often outrageous. You see clubs for queens. Mid-sixties, you would find gay places Rue Sainte-Anne. But it was quite expensive. There, you would rather see chic people trying to hide. Some kind of gay socialites. It's not for us. It is more bourgeois than gay. Bourgeois before gay. Gay people have always met in public places. Public toilets were meeting points. We knew that we could meet in those places. But you had to locate them. It was a way to meet without anybody noticing. Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, had created an urban squad. When parks were closed in Les Tuileries, for instance, there was a real invasion. We were very athletic at the time. We climbed barriers. This squad's official mission was to control identities and ensure public order. On site, they beat gays up. I know what I'm talking about. It was rather like what was happening in the united States and elsewhere. We had police raids, identity controls. We were never at rest, like some wild animals. People wanted to beat us up because we were different. Arcadie was created in 1954 by André Baudry, a former seminarian. It was a stern man who led the association and the review with an iron fist For us, it was from another century. We were opposed to that kind of homosexuality. We wanted to make the revolution, to change society. The tenth of March 1971 is a landmark for the LGBT movement, the gay people in France. There was a radio programme called "Allô Ménie". I'm Ménie Grégoire. Welcome to the show. The Salle Pleyel is crowed out. The radio network RTL was advertising this programme whose subject this very week was: homosexuality, a painful issue. Young homosexual boys said to me they were unhappy to the point to attempt suicide. they can't stand it. À group of activists, women and men, went and disturbed the programme. you cannot be indifferent to this suffering. There is no suffering. Listen, something totally unexpected has occured here. People are invading the stage. We are not suffering. Freedom! Freedom! Everybody stood up and climbed on the stage. This was fabulous. - Gay people are on the stage. - We want freedom! It was a victory. The show was interrupted. The interruption of this show hosted by Ménie Grégoire was a landmark for gay activists in France. The movement became more modern. To me, it is like the French Stonewall. We went against the tide. Oh poor gay people, let's help them. Poor young boys who're not manly enough. this very night, these men and women decided to create a group called the Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action. We're here to be a kind of internal contradiction. Like others, we're born into bourgeois and straight families with their strict education. Women are meant to procreate, and men are meant to be machos and inseminators. The main figure of the FHAR is Guy Hocquenghem, a Parisian, bourgeois and intellectual, a far-left activist. Most of men are not gay because they fear to lose their superiority with this type of sexuality. Guy Hocquenghem embodies a particular time. That's the first time you read, you listen to, you see someone - he was handsome, a kind of Adonis - who talks, who simply talks as if tit were a simple topic. To me, Guy has been one of few gay men to say that it is thanks to women that gay men rebelled. Gays with us! Women played a major role in the LGBT movement. Lesbians had a decisive role in the creation of the FHAR. There's something common to feminism and the fight against homophobia, it's the struggle against patriarchy. And this is why gay men would have the same status as women. Through the insults, gay men are seen as passive, feminine. They were also seen negatively, considered as passive and feminine. That's how they adopted feminism. Women do not have the same economic status. A lot of men participated to the second meeting. They would interrupt women. We said stop right away. We've had our share of misogyny. We'll create our own group, the Red Dykes. You could see everywhere people hitting on other people. We made out anytime anywhere. There was an ad for the subway. Take the second car. Subway was another car. TAKE THE SECOND CAR We had our own slogan: Meet in the second carriage. Gays were getting on the second carriage. That was a meeting point. It was a total liberation. We dared to make out. Girls and boys. It was a true melting pot. It was a time of sexual liberation. It was a time of real orgy. lt was a democratic orgy. End of the seventies, in Le Marais, in Paris, there's a radical change. À few owners opened gay bars. They wanted to do like everywhere. End of the seventies, beginning of the eighties, this neighbourhood is, I won't say notorious, but it is rather dirty, bleak. You don't go there. Pioneers weren't necessarily activists. They wanted to do differently, to offer something different. They had travelled. They knew how it was in Amsterdam, New York. They wanted to copy what existed elsewhere. The first gay bar "Le Village" was created end of 1978. It was opened all day. Prices were like everywhere. There were no curtains. The door was opened. People were also on the sidewalk. It was highly symbolic. We did not need to hide. You could go in front of the bar, walk past it. You would see who was there, see your friend. lt was open. In 1978, Le Palace opened. Everyone and no one could enter. That was great. There were people, often girls, who decided who could go in. I was with a friend. We went in. And there was Karl Lagerfeld. But he didn't go in. The girl said to me and my friend: go in. And Karl went: what's happening? I don't understand. I can't go in. Not every night. Beat it! That's what she said to Lagerfeld. It was harsh to some celebrities, to say the least. Don't come with your grandma. Don't come with your friends. You have nothing else to wear. You would see men, women, youth, old people, celebrities. Tramps, ministers, presidents, actors, etc. You would see everything. Watch, dance, drink, sing and more if people get along. And people got along in this place. And on Sundays, there was the gay tea dance. À kind of tradition with a gay touch. That was fun! Some of them could escape to parental constraint. to overwhelming bourgeoisie, to unbearable Catholic principles. That was a way to meet people of your kind and to discover disco music piece by piece. It was a lively music from the United States, from New York. It was the time of disco With Jimmy Somerville. All these fantastic hits. A joyful music. That's a wave of joy, a wave of freedom. You had pink satin trousers. Yellow, green, every colour. Taht was life, night-time a colourful period. That was part of an undefined gay culture. That was even sometimes clandestine. But the message to the world was clear: Fuck off! THE BASTILLE Last Night The election of François Mitterand brought some hope event though there was no real promises of changes. On May, 10th 1981, we were Place de la Bastille. There was a banner of the CUARH, which coordinated the gay movement. We were there, euphoric. We shouted: we want a Ministry of Gayness. We were hoping for change. We saw it was possible. Homosexuality will be decriminalised. You must consider the context, how French society was. If you were condemned for homosexuality, it appeared in your criminal record. It was really awful. Some of them can't accept it. | knew one who committed suicide. He was haunted by what his family could think of him. It may seem paradoxical. But at this time, the norm, the opinions were based on homophobia. That was something common. The Keeper of the Seals, the Minister of Justice may now speak. This discrimination and this repression are contradictory to our principles those of a free and great country. The moment has come for this assembly to put an end to these discriminations and all those that still exist in our society because that's unworthy of France. I wouldn't change a word. l wouldn't change anything. l'm glad to have had the opportunity to make this statement and that it gave birth to a law, to new rights. We have to deem upon the deep latent homophobia, this subjacent movement, because it did not disappear with the promulgation of the law. That's pretty unique to see such a change. There was some hope. It's always the same thing. In this world, each manifestation of joy, each manifestation of freedom, of happiness is swept away by something else. In 1981, I worked at Claude Bernard hospital in the department of infectious and tropical diseases Besides tropical diseases, I was in charge of patients whose cases were enigmatic. There was something particular with these five patients described in the review. They had no anterior cause to explain their immune deficiency. But they had something in common, their sexual orientation. They were all gay men. I received the news in the morning. And in the afternoon, I welcomed a patient who had been suffering from pulmonary infection for several weeks. There was no explanation. He was holding the hand of his companion. He was openly displaying his sexual preference. And I immediately saw the link between what I had read in the morning and the patient | had in front of me. The Kaposi sarcoma. That's the scientific term of a type of cancer already seen in Africa and which strikes the Occident. Its characteristic: it only affects gay men and in particular those who take stimulants. You don't know how you catch it. There is no test. There is no particular signs. There is no information. - Will it affect your relationships? - No, not at all. No. If I am bound to catch it, I'll catch it. It's like any other disease. Nothing's different. It makes no difference. People were refusing in a way to be informed. When we handed out flyers, people were kind of violent. Taht's what happened with Aides first activists. I'm trying not to lean too much about the consequences and what not. Our world collapsed. It was over. Everything disappeared. Nightlife was no longer attractive. The disco ball was not shining anymore. It was bright, shining. And it became dark. Shame on you! It's the same in France and in the United States. You deserve it! You had it coming! You decadent people! The Church really played its part and put the emphasis on the causal link. I had gay patients. And I had to leave Claude Bernard hospital. The director of the hospital said that if wanted to treat gay people I had to go elsewhere. Today, everybody say yes to condoms. When doctors told us we'd rather put condoms, we went what? That was my first reaction. You're talking about condoms. That's from another time. Yes. Do they sell those things? I didn't know what it was. It's a thing you put on your cock. That's all I knew. I didn't know much more. How does it work? lt was almost laughable. The person who was told he or she was positive expected to die within two years. We went the first to use a treatment which proved to be ineffective, It was called HPA-23. Hundreds of Americans came to France for this drug. Some made the trip on Concorde just for a consultation. They paid 12,5 francs to the hospital. This became a real issue. Are you willing to shake hands with a HIV-positive? Here's our phone number 851 56 56 I remember that some of my friends who were HIV-positive and died also suffered mentally because they were rejected by their families. They were not supported by their close family members. People could honestly say that an adult who was HIV-positive could not touch a child. People spread this idea. End of the eighties, begining of the nineties, it's a world of terror. Let's be frank. People are worried, people are powerless. Everyone, not only gay people, are sitting on a powder keg. There is no real treatment. People are sick. It is a horrific sight. The whole immune system is destroyed. I've seen this. That's impressive. l'd rather say it's terrifying. Every two days, you were at the hospital to say goodbye to someone. That's what we lived. And that wasn't a pleasant sight. There were huge spots all over the face, on the back. Death is never pleasent but you can be prepared for it. But this was sheer brutality. When | celebrated my 21st birthday, We were something like 25 at my house. And... À few years later, half of them, at least, had died. My grandfather was marked by WW. I was marked by AIDS. | can imagine what people felt after the war. People say remember this guy, he's dead. He died at the front, killed by a bullet. Really? But we went on with our lives. We adopted safer sex. We were trying to preserve our world, to hold tightly to our way of life. I remember one time, after the funeral of a friend, I eloped with the widower to spend the night with him. Voilà! It's easy to talk about it today but I was not reassured at the time. We had a gun on the temple. Having a shag anywhere at anytime was no longer an option. Those who kept this way of life died. That makes infected people feel better. They're not isolated, They're told that he is a huge Hollywood star. This man embodies virility. And they learn that he is gay, that he is infected, that he's going to die. It's a great feeling even though they're going to die soon. A PERSON IS DYING EVERY TWO HOURS This group's objective is in a way to fight fear. The fear of getting sick. The fear of being gay people subjected to the State, to powers. We feel very tiny faced with pharmaceutical labs, with medicine or medical research. From the start, we displayed a form of humour. That's something that could be found also in hospitals, in waiting rooms. There always was a drag queen to laugh off the situation. Right from the start, we had the support of media. Journalists loved Actu Up. because we offered them some performances. They were invited on site and could take pictures. the condom on the obelisk is the most iconic performance organized by Act Up. That was our best accomplishment. That's our way to fight AIDS! They wanted the condom to stay there for one day. They ripped it up. You're more reactive to withdraw a huge condom on the obelisk than to install condom distributors in high schools or syringe distributors in towns. There are more important things than HIV-positive people. No, | won't stop. l's World AIDS Day. Once more, France totally messed up. Your department is useless. We went very far as activists because we were afraid to die. Let's fight AIDS! It was an all-consuming activity. Our lives were dedicated to this cause. Act Up gets angry! Mid-nineties, that's a turning point. That's the beginning of triple therapy. Doctors have much more control. At the end of the nineties, a new phrase was used: find acceptance. We had to accept that infected people would not necessarily die. I think that we've learnt much from this tragedy, that mankind got strenghtened in the process. Gay people were first considered as normal patients and then like normal individuals. And because the disease was also transmitted between heterosexuals, there was a form of equality. At that time, gay people acted with dignity, though they were deeply suffering. And it struck the population, And gay people were considered differently by the whole society. There was then a form of sympathy. Opponents to the PACS led a large protestation. Tens of thousand people demonstrated in the heart of the capital this afternoon to show their opposition to the civil solidarity pact. No fags! Two men in a couple cannot build a family. That's not possible! No one expected such a violence. There was a kind of uproar. A lot of things were said or done. We could not imagine that such reactions were possible. Many people were struck by how violent the reactions were. There were so many shocking slogans and statements. How can shuch insults be uttered in public places? The TV channel M6 broadcasted a show during the debate on the PACS. They asked me if I was willing to participate. The question was not for me do I make my coming out or not but can I refuse, I'm destabilized. I'm happy. I don't hide anything. l'm serene. I'm about to run for mayor of Paris. Why will I choose to be exposed? But homophobia at this time is so violent. that I would consider myself a coward to avoid the debate. So I decided to participate. I chose to do it for those who do not live in Paris, in big cities, in full light. for those who are isolated, for youngsters. I knew suicide was an option for young gay people. When Delanoë had the courage to make his coming out I thought he was lost. But I was wrong. This building right before me will be a home for Parisians It was not an issue because Parisians acted in a very smart manner. The fact that | was homosexual was not a criteria. They wanted to see what I was capable of, if I was smart enough. They tried to imagine what the result could be if I was elected. I'm delighted to have seen Parisians acted like true democrats. That's what I'm the most proud of. The fact that l'm gay did not matter. In the streets, on markets, on the subway, not a single time, I was told that the fact l'm gay was a problem or an asset. They had their opinions. But my situation did not matter. That's what I was hoping for. That's the mayor of Paris. He had a major role to play. It was a bit like... That was great, Same-sex marriage, that's a landmark. And for the gay movements, that's a betrayal. You enter the city hall. You promise to be faithful, etc. All the values we were opposed to. Men or women who wish for same-sex mariage, that's their choice and it must be written in the law. I'm totally supportive. But that's not my thing. All this struggle for such a result, that's a big waste. What's the point to do as mum and daddy? To live through the seventies with revolutionary gay people to obtain same-sex marriage and maternity, If I had knew, if someone had told me, would have stayed at home. Your law, we don't want it! Marriage is an institution which guarantees the transmission of life. The traditional form of family is completely altered. Gays do not have brains. With the debate on same-sex marriage, we were surprised once again. We had seen the same reactions with the PACS. But naively, we thought that the situation had evolved. We thought that with the PACS the question had been largely discussed. First, second, third generations. We're all children of straight people. What struck me the most in the demonstrations against the PACS and same-sex marriage, it is the fact that the Church supported them. But they were facing people who wanted to get married. Some of them wanted to get married at the church. they should have given them their blessing. After... After 136 hours and 46 minutes of debate, the National Assembly has adopted the bill to legalize same-sex marriage. To the adolescents, boys and girls, of this country who have been hurt, who have been lost these last days, we want to say that they're unique that they have a place in society. Keep your heads high. You don't have to blame yourselves. We state this loud and clear with a strong voice. As Nietzsche said: Truth kills. And if you repress it, it will kill you. Thank you very much. We have this need to identify with someone else. We have to find a model, some references. That's very important. We're learning all the insults, fag, dyke, tranny before realizing we belong to this movement. That may sound stupid but when | was young homosexuality was a boys’ thing. I had never seen two girls kissing in a movie, two girls kissing in the streets or lesbians among celebrities, There was a kind of pride, beyond the pride of being gay, of being clandestine, You don't see nothing but if you knew... Do we still need community places? Sure, we do. Among people of your kind, there's no need to be on your guard. Lesbians are not bothered by men. There's no problem to see a man hitting on another. We need this. Straight people cannot really understand. They don't realise it because they live in a straight society. Sometimes, I have to pinch myself. Don't forget the guy who was beaten up in Vierzon. Don't forget the lesbian at the factory who is taunted for her sexuality. Of course, it happens. We cannot deny it. In some countries, gays are facing death penalty. I think that, here in France, those who fight for gay people, are quite indifferent, make do with this situation. Yes, we're opposed to this. Alright, what are we doing? Do we demonstrate? Do we march in the streets? No. We find it regrettable. That's it. Here, we've obtained everything so let's not think of other countries. This is some kind of indifference, really, some kind of selfishness. Freedom is also a privilege. Wealth is not the only privilege.
