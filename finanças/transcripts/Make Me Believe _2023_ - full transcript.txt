MAKE ME BELIEVE Careful you bastard! Come on. Pick up, Precious. PRECIOUS Grandma? Grandma? You in here? Where are you? Grandma? Grandma? Where are you? - Grandma? What's going on? - Is Aysel not here? Hey. My grandma texted saying her palpitations got worse, but now she won't pick up. Doruk's your name, yes? I remember. Yeah, I don't think you do. Good thing you found your way here. My grandma's phone was giving me a dial tone. Now it sounds completely powered off. Her upstairs window might open up. I'm gonna go check. Her window's locked. - It's ringing but she's not picking up. - It's ringing inside! What do we do? Something could have happened. Whoa! Look at that! What have you done? Get that off of me. You two are like children. How come you tell me you're having palpitations and then not pick up my calls? I dropped everything to come here. Where have you both been anyway, huh? At the beach. My phone died. I forgot mine. How could I have known that you would come rushing over here? Oh, really? And what exactly did you expect me to do? - All right, just stop. - Uh-huh! Think we're babies? Whenever I call you, you say, "Nana, I'm in Europe right now," or, "I'll call you back. I don't have any cell service." "Nana, I'm up on a mountain. Please don't call me." - Oh my god. - You never have time for us anymore. You won't visit unless we tell you that we're dying. Aysel, I got the measurements. I'll install the glass tomorrow. All right. That's okay. That's okay. Okay. I'll stay tonight. What? Why would you sleep here? Can't be too careful anymore, am I right? I'd have to intervene if someone tried to break in here. - Someone could break a window. - Oh, really? Don't you think you're a little bit old to play Superman? Hmm? It's all just so boring. Crazy. You remembered how old I am. Come on. Let's head home. He's surely exhausted from the road. And the two of you can stay with us if you feel unsafe here. Come on now. I'll leave this here. It's useless now. - Let's go, Nana. - Yes, let's go. He thinks it's useless? It hardly has a scratch. Jerk. Listen, are you doing all right? My darling, I'll give any twenty-year-old a run for their money. Are you okay? I mean, shattering my window was extreme. Don't you have a key? The key didn't cross my mind. I was going to work. I turned around to get here as fast as I could. I was so afraid you were hurt, all right? You're stuck with me. You'll still see much more of me. Mmm, how I've missed my sweet little girl. My darling girl. Yum. Mmm. Mmm. What's going on? Huh? I don't know what you mean. Nana. Hmm? This has eggplant in it. So, tell me. What are you up to? Honey, I wanted to see my grandchild. I haven't seen you in so long. You never call or visit. Nana, come on. Every week Ulaş comes over. Work's been insane, you know? I've had a lot of things to do. But you're not bored, right? You can't be. It has to be something else. I feel abandoned. Would I ever abandon you? Come on. You're my queen, huh? God, I've missed you. Aw. Of course you have, my love. - All right, now, listen. - Yeah? Don't ever do this again, please. Grandma, just tell me to come over and I will. I promise. - Sound good? - Yes, my love. - Oh, sweetheart. - I'm not about to turn down pastries. Well, come on. Eat up. She seems okay. But I'm staying over this weekend. - How's it there? - Men. Kerem's been in Ms. Selin's office since this morning. He's trying to get the cover for next month. And Ms. Selin seems interested in the idea. Can't believe I can't be gone for one day. What's he got? A model that came for a special event from somewhere abroad. She's collaborating with a luxury lingerie brand. They put a collection together. All that's left to complete's the interview. But they've already done the shots. Seriously? How are the visuals? Hmm. EDITOR SAHRA ERDENİZ They're, um... Well, they're not all bad. They're not great either. That freaking sexist jerk. "We've contacted our photographer." "We'll shoot soon as he's back from Africa." If she comes to find out you're lying, that jerk Kerem will get the cover and the editor-in-chief position. I was simply trying to buy us time, Ahu. I can't even reach this guy's people. What is up with you? Are you trying to make me go nuts? Or is this all just some sick joke? I'm telling you, I'll make it right. I promise. Just relax. I'll call you later, all right? Bye. All right. Just call me back. You snake. Honey, you're wearing yourself out. You need to calm down. I can't begin to tell you all I'm dealing with. Go take this to Semiha. I kept her plate and can't send it back empty. Why do I have to? Why should I go when my amazing granddaughter is here with me? What will people say? Oh, come on. Come on, my dear. Come on, darling. Off you go. - My sweet girl. Go on. - All right. Deniz! Could you come down here for a second? You called, Nana? Sahra's on the porch. She's got a plate. Now go get it. I don't wanna deal with her, all right? I'm covered in a bunch of dough. She's been out there for ages. Come on. Here. Something to share, Deniz? I see you remembered my name. Wait. There's no way you made these. And what makes you say that? Because these are actually good. They're way too thin and delicious. So you probably didn't make these. Hmm. I hope the likes of you die out. Fingers crossed. Yeah, in your dreams. Jerk. I hope you choke on them. He hasn't evolved at all since he was 15. Take that, you evil prick! Suck it, Kerem! Suck it! I knew it! I knew it! Ah! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, it's great! Okay. Okay. Hold on. What mischief has Kerem caused? Oh, let me tell you. My cover interview? He tried to steal it. But your granddaughter's a genius. Remember that photographer I've been trying to work with? - Yeah? - Deniz Tunalı. Well I can't just call his work "photography" because, I mean, it's just pure art. Anyway, he won one of the most prestigious global awards. Ah, is that right? Turns out he turned it down. Can you believe that? He's the only one to turn it down in nearly 50 years. It's ridiculous. And no one's been able to find him. I mean, at all. - Is that so? - He can't be found. No one has even seen his face. We just know his name, but we can't reach him. I bet if I just had a single damn photo of this guy... There's this thing called the internet. I'm sure you've heard of it. Grandma, listen. Just try searching Deniz Tunalı on the internet and tell me how many results you get. If it's impossible to reach him, why are you celebrating, hmm? In England, apparently there's a magazine that Deniz declined to interview with. So, I asked my friend who works there, and he gave me his rep's contact. Hmm. What if he turns down your offer as well, darling? Hmm? He will not. In view of my position as editor-in-chief being at risk, I'm not taking no for an answer, all right? CREEP To what do I owe the pleasure of this call? Are you going to tell Ms. Selin you can't reach your famous photographer and you've been making your team play along with your lies, or should I do the honors of telling her when I receive the promotion? You're not receiving anything. So save your nonsense for yourself. You just wait for the interview to come out. Admit it. I'm winning this, and I'll be your new boss in just a few days. Yeah, right. I'd rather resign. Yes, exactly. EDITOR KEREM SOYLU Very well. Then whichever person gets the next cover gets the promotion, and the other will quit. You up for it? - I am - It's going to be a glorious victory. Oh, good morning! What happened? One of my kittens climbed the tree and won't come down. And Deniz is asleep. Don't, don't! Just hang on. I'll help you. Oh, be careful, my dear. That lazy douche. - Wait. Let me hold that. - No. It's fine. I'll handle it. Hey! Hey! What on Earth are you doing up there? - Grandma, relax. - Sahra, what's going on? - Wait. Be careful. - Hold on, Semiha. Wait a minute. Grandma, it's fine. Come on. Semiha! Ah, Semiha! Is your grandson awake yet? He's fast asleep. I wasn't sure what to do. Please don't! I can do it. Just get out of the way. I'll come down. Can you pick up the ladder? Wait. I can't pick that up. I don't have the strength. - Grandma, stop! - Deniz! Just stop. I'm coming down. He'll be here in five minutes. Just stay there. Get out of my way. I'm going to jump. Hold on. Sahra, wait. - What's going on? - Deniz, help us. She's stuck up in the tree. I got up to...? Come on, Nana. What are you doing up there? Trying to see how many times you can fall out of this tree, or...? I was actually thinking I'd fall instead of Semiha. How does that sound? - Thanks. You're so thoughtful. - Irresponsible jerk! Please don't get on my nerves, or I'm gonna leave you up there, okay? Honestly, why would you climb a tree? Aren't you the type that walks around the city in five-inch heels? You're not built for this thing. Why does that matter? Here, take this kitten. Just get out of the way. I can get down myself. Who do you think you are, Superman? Oh no! I'm so sorry. So, so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I swear. - It's my fault. Ugh. - I'm so sorry. - Let me see. - Don't... Don't touch me, all right? Look, you've done enough. I don't need your help. I'm fine. Go and treat his wound. Semiha already did, probably. I'm sure they're good. You might want to go and try to apologize. Go on. Here's some tea. Oh! Come on in! Uh... Oh. I, uh... My grandma wanted me to bring some dressing material, but I see... I'll take it. Thank you, dear. I know this photo. Ah! It's from Deniz's first exhibition. But you remember, he was always taking photos as a kid. He was so passionate, he just never stopped. - Deniz Tunalı? - Yes, Tunalı. You're saying the photographer that took that photo is the Deniz Tunalı. Your grandson is Deniz Tunalı? That's right. My grandson, Deniz Tunalı. Deniz Tunalı. Huh. Ahu, Deniz Tunalı is next door. But I just cracked his head open. I made a deal with Kerem. Whoever doesn't get editor-in-chief is quitting. You need to drop everything and come over. I'll text you some things you need to bring. So, you're saying this girl arrives, takes your cherished helmet, and throws it through a window. Did I get that right? So then you took the helmet and you gave it to her. You wouldn't even give me that helmet, but you gave it to a girl. And she cracked your head open. Well done! I applaud her. - This is your fault, by the way. - What does this have to do with me? What's so great about that Greek island? You've got impeccable timing, you know? Can I have a glass of water? Is that so bad? You got to see your grandma. You know she really missed you. And you know what? I bet the girl's 100% in the right. Sometimes you don't hear what comes out of your own mouth. You do tend to overreact a lot. I should've just done it sooner. What do you mean? Wait a minute. Is she... You know I have to meet her, right? Well, well, well, well. I don't know whether I should be worried or happy. I mean, this is complicated. I should have known as soon as I saw that photo at the show. - That dinghy... - What dinghy? Never mind the dinghy, 'kay? That's my problem. What are we gonna do? Deniz is spiteful. And he doesn't forgive people. Okay, but it's been years, hasn't it? And look, the guy could've changed. I don't think people change, Ahu. If he doesn't forgive me, he won't do the piece. Morning. Good morning. Good morning. Come on, get up. Get up. Get up. Let's get to work. Sahra, it's too early, even for us. Can we sleep another hour? Please. One hour, please. - Just one hour. - Don't be ridiculous. Get up! Get up! We need to go shopping. It's getting late. You know this is a vacation spot, right? Think any shops will be open this early? One hour, please? Pretty please. Sahra speaking. That's right. Which issue did you say it was? No problem. I'll check that and I'll get right back to you. Thank you. Have a good day. How are you, Semiha? It's nice to see you. Hi, honey. Good morning Umm, would you be interested in all of us having breakfast? Maybe we could ease the tension from yesterday. I can try to fix things. If you'd like that, that is. Well, of course that'd be nice. Wonderful. Well then, I'll be a minute. Gonna go check on things. We're going to mess up the cover for July while we chase after August, Ahu. Why didn't you say? Mert's questions are fine, but the issue's the shoot. It's bad and needs a redo. Sounds like you're well-rested. - Good morning girls! - Good morning. I was thinking we should move your office here, huh? Who's Mert? He should have come too. Well, Aysel, someone has to stay back in Istanbul and work on this month's cover. - Anyway, let me get the tea for breakfast. - I'll help you. Hey. Where are you going, exactly? To help Ahu. No, because I invited Semiha and Deniz over to eat with us, and while Ahu is getting the tea ready, the two of us are going to discuss how you watched in silence as I suffered while I desperately looked for Deniz Tunalı. How's that sound? What would you have done if I had said something? You're relentless, and you would've been pestering him. You were going to harass him. I thought it would be best if you fixed things between you two, and then talked. What a great idea! Awesome idea, really. What do you think? Did it go the way you thought it would? I didn't tell you to crack his head like an egg! - Where's the tea, Aysel? - I'm coming, dear. And stop messing with my poor head. It's right here. On top of this cabinet. Where's my gift at? Cabinet next to the table in the living room. - The pastries are here. - Oh. All right. Where's Deniz? Is he not awake yet? He went out last night and hasn't come home yet. Hey, man. There's coffee. Why am I hearing this from you instead of some beautiful woman? Learn to be happy with everything you've got. Listen. Get up. Let's go over to Semiha's house and have some breakfast. I don't want to ruin my day drinking coffee with you. And why would they be having breakfast at this hour? Are you insane? You have breakfast when you wake up. It's not about the time. You don't have to come. Suit yourself. All right. Let's do it. Hey, not bad. Which one's Deniz? The one who doesn't know how to smile. Well, he's handsome. But still, his photography is even greater than he is. The guy who can fit all these intense emotions into one single shot is a major prick. Why didn't you two come here last night? We had a wonderful breakfast outside. - You missed it. - Because this guy's feeling salty. I said, "Aunt Semiha probably misses me. Let's go over there." But he doesn't let me. He gets jealous. Also, he's really mad at the girl next door. Pastries are good. Here, why don't you have this one, Ulaş? What are you doing, man? I love you very much. I'm going to eat some pastry in the yard. - Where you going? Bring that back here! - Huh? - Give that to me. - What are you doing, man? You can go wherever you want now. You two still act like such little kids. He took the small one. So, you two were childhood friends then? Is that right? - You could say that. - Not at all. We weren't friends. Well, we weren't anything really. What is this bizarre thing going on between you guys? - Enjoy your food. - Deniz? Can you wait here for a sec? I'll be right back. What is that? It's 'cause I owe you one. I don't really understand why you can't use the other one, but... Anyway, it's a peace offering. I asked Ahu to get you a new one and bring it here. I... I'm... Um... Well, uh... Uh, well, I... I called to place an order. I guess they thought I was ordering it for myself. Look, I'm really sorry. You shouldn't apologize for it, Ahu. It was a nice thing to do. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Well, it wasn't supposed to be like this. Really. I think the colors are pretty, to be honest. Yeah, the colors kinda are pretty. But the other one had sentimental value. I guess we all know that Sahra can be great at ruining memories. It's really not your fault, Ahu. Semiha said she was looking for a new flower pot. I think this'll make a great one, so thanks. See you guys. If you want to work with Kerem, just say so, and let's not waste my time. All right, I'm starting Operation Trojan Horse. Ulaş. He's the Trojan horse that'll guide us to Deniz. He'll tell us about his friend's interests, weaknesses, where he goes, what he drinks, who he hangs out with. - He'll give us his entire routine. - Hmm. I get it. I do. But how exactly are we going to get all that from him? Like this. Hello. Can I have two gin and tonics? I'm so sorry. I didn't recognize you. It's Ulaş, right? So then, you work here? Sorta. It's surprising to see you two here. Yeah, well, we had to get some fresh air. We heard that this place is the best. So, we wanted to check it out. Gotcha. Uh, can I get you anything to eat? Mmm, just surprise us. Okay. I'll make the gin and tonics first then. What's next? Now, Ulaş will come to our table in a few. We'll ask him to sit with us. He will. When Deniz comes, he'll sit with us, too. - And if he doesn't? - Have a little faith. By the way, how we doing with the cover for July? Not great, because you keep rejecting everything we suggest. We can't find something original every time. You'd better. Enjoy. Actually, can I join you while you brainstorm ideas? Of course. Have a seat. All right. What's your vision? What do you want? I used to be in advertising. I know a little about this business. Okay, well, it's renewable fashion. One of the industry's pioneers is doing a project that is eco-friendly and transposable. Our team's writing an article for him. The article's okay, but the concept of the photoshoot is a total fiasco. And Sahra can be a difficult one to charm. How about this? Why don't we do the cover photoshoot here? This place could have the feeling you're looking for. What feeling are you after? Well... Fresh, natural. Something that blends past with future. Effortless but still very sophisticated. And authentic. - Excuse me. - Sir, Deniz wants to get his helmet. Right. I have your solution. Deniz, come here. People are shameless. So insistent about an interview. Give me the helmet. Can you bring two helmets from my office? - Why? - Babakale. It's beautiful in the evening, at sunset. Beautiful fishing boats, a seawall at the foot of the castle. The view is great. Deniz will take you to check it out. Ahu and I will look at alternative places in case you don't like it. What are you talking about? Excuse us. Come with me for a sec? Don't be an ass. Try to be a little nice. See? This is a great opportunity. Speak his language. Go and just live in the moment. Live it up. Go wild. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. You don't think he'll tell me to go to hell when he finds out I'm the one who wants to do the interview? You gonna take this? So are we gonna go? Can you go to the end of the pier? Is it always going to be like this? Hmm? Look, we're not 15 anymore. Any chance you're ready to get outta here? Know anywhere quieter? Huh? Cool. No. I got it. 'Cause I wanna apologize. For everything. Look, can we just break this tension? Is this your new sanctuary? Why? Are you taking that away from me too? Let's just say I'm learning from my past. But this place really is beautiful. Sounds to me like you're too busy to travel or explore, right? There are places better than this. I heard you never even leave the house when you visit Aysel. Hey, you still look up at the stars and dream? You still collect rocks from places you want to remember? You didn't forget. Well, you were the one who said that you had. Ah! What was that? Are you out of your mind? No! Wait. Where are you going? Unbelievable. Way to go. Way to go. Lost the keys to the bike. What? What do you mean that you lost them? How are we gonna find 'em? What do you mean? Did you throw them? Yes, I threw them! 'Cause I'm a maniac. I threw the keys in the sea. Why didn't you just leave them in the goddamn... What are we going to do now? We're walking. We're walking? Deniz? For once, just for once, can things with you just ever be simple? Huh? Is that not possible? Do you always have to do damage? - But... - No, just stop. Don't say anything to me, Sahra. Deniz, look I really... Stop. Please stop. Just stop. Deniz. Deniz, I'm so sorry. Sahra, please don't apologize to me. What are you even apologizing for? 'Cause I don't even know, honestly. Every time you apologize to me, something bad happens. Don't speak to me. Don't come anywhere near me. Just stop bothering me. I've been wondering, what are you doing with that girl, huh? What's all that about anyway? Okay. Cut to the chase, Deniz. Ahu's sweet, beautiful and fun to talk to. And I mean, what do you even have against Sahra anyway? She's unstable. She was like this when she was little. She'd act as she pleased, saying and doing anything she wanted. Nothing's really changed much. I should congratulate her. That's why I don't have the energy to deal with a wreck like her. Do as you please with the girl, but keep me out of it. You said they'd like each other if we just brought them together and let them be. But look at them. Deniz took off already, just like that. What's gotten into that granddaughter of yours? What? I don't know. They've been searching for each other for years now. One way or another, they're going to see that eventually, but how? - I know! - I know! - You go first. - Look... What if we play a little game with them? I was just thinking that too. Ah! You're brilliant! Yes, I'm... I'm really sorry about all of this, and I'll get back to you guys right away. Thank you. Have a good day. I mean, I trust my team, but why do I trust them? I'm doing all I can for next month's cover, and what is my team doing for us? Shit! Honey, this anger has absolutely nothing to do with that. You're taking it out on the team for no reason. Wanna share what happened last night with you two? It doesn't matter anymore. The outcome matters. The jerk has ordered me not to see or even communicate with him ever again. Let's go and talk to Ulaş, and maybe he can convince Deniz. Don't be ridiculous. Do you really think he'd contradict his childhood friend for some girl he kissed? Well, he does like me, I think. Anyway. These spots are really nice. And it'd be great if we could use the ruins and the roads inside the ancient city. It would. Wanna go over there maybe to check it out? I'm clearly not going to be able to convince Deniz after all, so... Let's at least give them our most stunning last issue. Hey. Don't be like that. Keep your head up. The magazine needs us. Ah, there you are. All right. Come with me. This way. Nana, what is the point of this? This place is filled with tourists, so that's why he's asking. We would've come, no matter what. - We don't want you to get tired. - Stop talking and just come with me. We're going to the Culture Office for permission. Your friend's helping us with the process. Uh, I've sent the clothes too. They'll handle all that. The transfer's sorted as well. Almost everything's done. What about the agency? No issues there either, but Mert is going to talk to the photographer for this out-of-town work. I freaking hate all photographers. Just wait for me here. I'll be quick. Whoa! - Welcome back, Deniz. - Thank you. - It's been such a long time. - I've been slammed with work. Yeah? And how about you and Sahra? Did the two of you finally make up? We never fell out. Naim, can you come here for a second? I'll be right there, Semiha. - Hold these for a sec? - Where you going? Just hold 'em for a sec. There's something I gotta do. Really? And what might that be? Good luck. What's up? What's up? I messaged you earlier. Uh... Wanna go for a walk with me? I have to work right now. No. You two go ahead. It's nothing I won't be able to handle on my own. See ya. Can I assist you with anything? All good, gorgeous. All right. Why can't I recall inviting either of you over to sit with me? Well, we just saw how beautiful you are and wanted an up close and personal peek. What do you think you're doing, huh? - Wait! It's a misunderstanding. - Misunderstanding my ass! Break them apart! - It was a misunderstanding. I swear. - Enough with the misunderstanding! Enough! Haven't you had enough of my bag, huh? Who do you think you're hitting on, huh? Well-deserved! Sahra, break it up! Stop it! - Ma'am? Ma'am. - Who do you think you are? - Where's the other one? - Okay. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Move it. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on now. - Oh my! - Ah, ah. What have we done, Semiha? I really want to thank you. I mean it. Seriously. I had never seen the interior of a prison cell, and now, thanks to you, I have. Well I've never been inside a prison cell before either. And we wouldn't be here if you had just stayed out of it. - It's my fault then? - Yes, it's your fault. If you hadn't jumped the guy, I would have had a valid reason for it, and none of this would have happened. That's amazing. I didn't know that helping out was a crime. Helping? Helping? But did I ask you for your help? Huh? I didn't even make eye contact, like you asked. But what happened? You decided to jump in. I didn't jump in anywhere. You, on the other hand, jumped everyone. So hard that he's claimed it was battery. Hmm. Yeah, they've both filed a statement, I guess. Commander, please. You know us. If Sahra had never been harassed by those buffoons, then she and Deniz wouldn't've reacted that way. Sahra and Deniz don't have a single scratch on their bodies, but the other two guys are all messed up. Yes? Come in. GENDARMERIE Come in. Come in. We were forced to hit on that woman by her grandmother, sir. We're innocent. We already told Aysel, too. It all felt immoral, but... she demanded. We begged them, Commander. They didn't want to listen. They told us that it was for a good cause, sir. You don't know what Semiha can be like, Commander. She's a tough lady. We didn't have a choice, please. She told us it would only end in a quarrel. How were we supposed to know she'd turn into Jackie Chan? I see. We'll release your friends in the morning. Go home and rest. There's no need for you to wait around here. - Thank you. - Watch out for the old ladies, though. Don't let them cause any more trouble. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Goodbye. They beat them up pretty bad. Commander. Thank you. I guess the beating we took wasn't for nothing. Get in. Where are you going? You can't walk there. Come on. Hop on. I thought we're not supposed to speak. You don't have to speak. Think of it as public transport. Can you slow down a little bit? Chicken. Slow down, all right? Would you just please go even a little bit slower? Chicken. Wait, what is that? Is that normal? What are those sounds? What's going on, Deniz? Is normal even a possibility whenever you're present? What do you want from me, huh? What did I ever do to you? Look, I want to get off. - I want to get off! Stop the bike. Stop! - All right, I'll stop. I'll stop! You know what? You're the rudest, reckless, meanest, most selfish and disrespectful, evil man I have ever met in my life. You're so completely narrow-minded that you don't even try to understand other people! You're so negative! You're so negative that I can't seem to do anything right around you! Fine! I can't do anything right! Yes, I'm a chicken. Maybe that's true, okay? I'm petrified of riding on a freaking bike because a bike accident is how I lost my entire family! And I would've told you if you'd just asked why I was scared. But instead, you chose to go faster and make fun of me. You happy? Are you proud? I'm a chicken, all right? But you're an asshole. How's that? I think we make a good team, huh? What do you say? Can we just be friends again? But we never really were friends, Sahra. And we never will be either. I'm curious about one thing. You say you're afraid of motorcycles, but you're not afraid of pushing a guy into the sea in the middle of the night, or of smashing a window in. You're afraid your hand will get oily when you're eating fish, but you're not afraid to beat the shit out of two men in town. So, which one is it? You say nothing works out whenever I'm around, except then you just kiss me out of the blue. Which one are you? All of 'em. It's like everything breaks down when I'm around you. But mostly I break down. I can't control myself. Although I was never really able to. That's my thing, actually. Control, I mean. I got on a bike for the first time after the accident when I was going to Babakale with you. I pushed you in the sea because Ahu told me to do something unexpected. I would never go into the water if I can't see the bottom. I like control too. About the fish... I don't like the messy, greasy feeling on me. I was like that as a kid, too. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Why? And the helmet's unique 'cause...? You. Why me? I got it that summer for you. Maybe I thought we'd go somewhere together. I never found the opportunity to get it to you. So, I guess... I got what was meant for me all along. Why are the two of you making such a fuss? You should've known it would end up like this, to be honest. After all, you know how your grandchildren are. - We thought it might be a good plan. - They made us do it. They've been avoiding each other for years. Deniz comes over in the middle of the week to avoid her. Absurd. But what did you expect? This will never happen, and we've gotta let it go. It's done. Hmm. Shh! No one say anything. We won't if they don't already know. - Ah! My darling girl. - My boy. Oh! - Do they seem way too chill? - I was so worried. What's going on with these guys? Something happened, for sure. You're hiding something from me. What are you hiding? What happened? - You've lost your mind. - Sahra, don't be like that. I don't know what you mean. And besides, what could have even happened in one night in a stupid prison? I think you've seriously lost your head. - I... - Also, none of our work is going to plan. - We couldn't get the permit. - Ulaş sorted that out. We're doing the shoot on Monday. Besides, everybody knows about everything. What exactly do they know about, Ahu? Do they know about jail? Only that our famous photographer Deniz is being a little complicated with some of his requests for the shoot. - Hmm! - So, when are we doing the interview? Well I think it might be a little too early to tell. I gotta ask him. I couldn't... I mean... I couldn't find a way to ask him properly. I'll figure something out. You got the coffee? Please? Sure, babe. Being in a cell didn't do you any good then, huh? You're always claiming you know everyone, and yet you couldn't get us out of prison. What was I supposed to do? Maybe you shouldn't beat up dudes on the street, whether or not I'm able to help. What's up? - 'Sup? - Hey. Hey, let me you ask something. Does Sahra's head or does her back hurt? Why would either of those hurt? I was just thinking if being in a cell was good for her or not. That's why. I don't know about that, but I feel like a beating would do you some good. Hey, man, you should watch it. Calm down. You just got out of jail. Please stay out of trouble, okay? Idiot! Snake! She must have just talked to Kerem. It's okay. She's always like this. Who's Kerem? An evil and vicious snake. You'd wanna punch his face in. I should check on her. What did he say? He's very confident. He's up to something. Sahra, did I mess up by telling them about you and Deniz meeting up? I really shouldn't have. I'm sorry. Don't be absurd. We've achieved what we've been pursuing for months, okay? But if Kerem found out, he won't be content with me just resigning. He'll do everything he can to get me fired. Ahu, please scan every single detail with a fine-toothed comb. Nothing can be overlooked. Okay. Okay. I'll go over everything. You okay? Mmm. Is it work? I might have an idea that'll cheer you up. Come on. Huh. You really shouldn't have let my immaturity ruin this place for you. Remember how cruel you were? Why are you like this? Hmm? That whole summer, you didn't even talk to me. And I couldn't talk to you either. You were completely withdrawn. Because you decided to bring a bunch of people to a special place that was just supposed to be ours. Then you went off with a boy when you knew that I liked you, but you ignored that completely. That's it? Seriously, a boy? Besides, you never told me you liked me. What exactly was I supposed to do? I might've told you if you'd showed up alone. I can't read minds. You were the only one who didn't see it. Or is it that you didn't want to see it? I did all sorts of things to get you to notice me. You didn't have to do anything. All you had to do was be yourself. But I was 15! So was I! Come on. Look, that's all in the past. There's nothing we can do. You hear me? I'm really sorry. I apologize to you and to that teenager. So why did you stop visiting? Um, I lost both my parents in an accident that summer. It was their wedding anniversary, and we were supposed to take the car to go celebrate. But I didn't feel that good. So then they decided to take my father's bike, just the two of them. So, yeah. After all that, it took some time for me to be okay. I'm sorry. And when I did come back, you were gone. My parents moved to Germany that winter. They broke up two years after that. Then Mom went to Italy. My dad remarried. We went three separate ways. Do you still see them? I see them if I'm over in the area, working. Sorry. Don't be. I'm not. We're better now that we're apart. Actually, you know what? Even before Semiha told me it was you, I should have suspected it. When I first saw that photo in the exhibition, I was so amazed. It was just so captivating. Explain this, though. Why did you refuse an award like that? Why would you run from the success? Doesn't everyone work for that? How'd it feel when you first saw the photo? It's hard to explain, actually. I sort of felt... Well, mesmerized, I guess. See, that's my award then. The photos I take and edit don't just capture the moment. They convey my feelings and my thoughts, my past, my goals for the future. Every part of me that makes up my life. So I... I share that with everyone who sees my work. I'm making a connection, a special connection. You can't put a prize on that. It doesn't compare. That's the reward. - Is this where you grew up? - Sort of. Hmm. It's beautiful. Here, I wanna show you something. Take it. One from each of the places I've been. Are these for me? Hmm. Good morning. Hey. What are you up to? The one thing university taught me. Wait, so you're an architect? If you become an architect just because you finish school, then yes, I am. But I never worked as one. And what's this model? Some fancy home? It's an old design. I started it while I was still studying. I thought I might live here if one day I had a family. Then this all just became a hobby. How come you didn't complete it? There was no rush. Here you go. - Hey, thank you. - Enjoy. There's something I want to know. So... I just wonder... Hmm? What's that? You've got all these stories, this success and recognition. You're talented. Why won't you let people get to know you? What do you wanna know? Just ask me. Not like that. You already told me. But you're against doing interviews. Or appearances. It's just my business. No one else's. They're my scars. I don't think you should share your privacy with those who aren't special. I think the rest of the world will do just fine with only looking at my photos. Actually... the photos themselves tell the entire story That's more than enough. One last question. Hmm? - Here I go. - Go. How are you able to maintain this mystery when everyone knows your name? Not showing yourself to people is an incredible PR tool. It's strange if you just don't show up to exhibitions saying you're the photographer. Then you're still just a name. Also, Ulaş knows what he's doing. He's an amazing publicist. He's the one they should be celebrating. I'm coming for you! Here's to you. - Mmm! - Ah! No, no, don't. It's still hot. You should try some. Ulaş? Hey, what's up, bro? Are the Golden Girls alive? Huh? Ahu needs to talk. - How early is it? - Four. What's up, Ahu? Huh? Hey. What do you mean we don't have a photographer? Mert, are you kidding me? We've been talking with him for two days. There were no issues. He told me when I called to pick him up, Ms. Sahra. Apparently he's flown out of town on another job. It's Kerem, huh? It's Kerem, right? It has to be. Why do I even bother asking? Who else would it be? We can't prove it either. I can't believe this. I can't believe this! Snake! Ooh, I swear I'll freaking kill him! Guys, the magazine is going to be released this week and I am still missing a cover! Guys, we do have a cover. So, everyone please just chill out. Huh? I can shoot it. No. Look, really, it's okay. You don't have to help me. It's nice of you to offer though. Don't worry. When I was in advertising, he did a lot of shoots for me. So he's used to doing it. It's true. Ulaş is right. I had to put up with a lot of his shit back then. So, it's not a problem for me. I'm down. I do have some conditions though. One, you can't publish my name in the magazine. Also, you'll have to downsize the team. I want one person for makeup, one for wardrobe and one for lights. And they'll all sign a non-disclosure agreement. All right. We should sign a contract too, because you can't be kissing me when we're on set. We'll in the ancient city in the morning. Get the team ready. Okay. Okay. Great. - Okay. Come a little closer. - I love that. Looks good on you. - What? - The t-shirt. Color suits your skin tone. I've never seen Deniz taking photos before. And what exactly have you seen him do then? Huh? Ahu! What is it you really want? What do you mean? The interview. What else could I want? - Have you talked about it? - Nope. Not going to because he doesn't want to. So, I've reassessed. What do you mean? Changed your mind? Do you realize what you'd be giving up? Whatever. It's okay. I'll stick to my word. I'll resign. Sahra, you're not making any sense. You're telling me you're special enough to make him do a fashion shoot, but he won't do an interview. You kidding me? We won't publish his name with the shoot, all right? No one will know he did it. But an interview is different. You're being selfish right now. I'm being selfish? - You realize what you're asking from me? - Yes, I do, 100%. Come on! I don't want you to leave this many years of blood, sweat and tears to Kerem. I don't want you to leave your entire team at Kerem's mercy, all right? I mean, do you realize that that you're sacrificing everything for this one guy? And what, you'd just be fine with letting down your other team members? Maybe let's not talk about this now. I don't really feel understood. You're right. I don't understand you. Isn't that the reason we've been here working this whole time? It's all lined up, so what's going on with you? I will not put the man I love in that position, Ahu. Okay, we'll discuss this later. I'll leave you alone. - How's it going? - Great. How are you doing? - Are there any issues? - No. Are you sure I signed an agreement not to kiss you on set? I did? Oh, but this is still allowed. My lady in white, - I'm gonna have you move to the right. - We'll have you here. Hold it right here. Okay. This is good. Once more. - Who's that? - Who? Ah, shit. That piece of shit Kerem's here. - Kerem who? - That asshole. He made a deal with Sahra. One of them's gonna resign. You'd beat him up if you knew him. Really? Why don't you introduce me? The hell do you want? Hey, I knew you've always been overly ambitious, but to go and sleep with the talent... What the hell are you saying? - Calm down, Sahra. - I'll smack you in the face! Whoa, whoa! Is your precious photographer aware of our deal? - Does he know you're using him? - I'll kill you. I swear to God. The hell's going on? What's going on? Deniz... - What? - Hey, my name's Kerem. What do you want? Editor at Intense Man magazine. How many times must I tell you people the interview's not happening? When I heard you were in Assos, I thought you had accepted Sahra's offer for an interview. What offer? Was I wrong? Wait a minute. So you... So this bet... It's about an interview? This whole... Wait. You're saying this entire thing was so you could interview me? Deniz. Mind if we speak in private? Sahra, it's a simple question. Was everything you and I shared, was it for a fucking interview? Of course not. I, um... At first, yes. But that was then. Incredible. You'll be all set to do the interview. You won't need anything else from me. Sahra knows everything. Ulaş will send you the photos. You win. Congrats, Sahra. Deniz? - Hey, it's all right. - You piece of shit... Deniz! Deniz! Deniz, stop, please! Deniz! The hell's going on, Sahra? Just come in. When was the last time you took a shower? Uh... What are you doing? Saving you all from Kerem. You wrote Deniz's interview? You positive about this? I was wrong. Who am I to let my team members down like that? It's not about the promotion, but if this is what it takes to stop Kerem from what he's doing... Sure you wanna expose his identity to the public? This story deserves to be heard. And I pretty much have nothing to lose anymore. Tell Ulaş to send the photos as soon as they're ready. I'll be off a few days. The team should be fine without me, so don't call unless it's an emergency. Sahra. Congratulations. Good job! Congratulations, Sahra. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF SAHRA ERDENİZ Congrats. Finally. Congratulations. EDITOR SAHRA ERDENİZ EDITOR-IN-CHIEF SAHRA ERDENİZ Chief? Could you kindly check your email for your first enactment in this new role? INTENSE ALTERNATIVE 1 - ALTERNATIVE 2 YOU CAN'T COMPARE ART A REBELLIOUS, MYSTERIOUS MAN NOV 8, 2019 SANTORINI - GREECE AUG 9, 2019 NAICA - MEXICO AUG 5 ASSOS AUG 5, 2008 ASSOS Hello! Come on! Get up! Get up. Pull yourself together. Ulaş, I can't deal with you right now. Leave me alone. Come on, man. I got bagels, and I even made some tea. Enough with the whole "Look at me, I'm broken and sad" act. Come on! Get up. Get it together. Go wash up. Let's go. Why'd you sleep on the couch? I couldn't bother going upstairs. Oh, please. Just say it. It's too hard to sleep in your bed alone. What are you doing here? Really. I didn't come here to see your pathetic face. Don't worry. I brought you this. Your interview. Read it. Eat your breakfast. Put something in your stomach other than alcohol. You and Ahu still hanging out? She's back in Istanbul. You'll leave soon. Summer's over. So... I have some plans, so we'll see. Good thing you didn't give the interview yourself. You wouldn't have described yourself so well. She did it really well. Who you are, what you do. I really think you should check it out. Maybe you'll direct your anger at her instead of yourself. First you'll fight a little, then you'll reconcile. Maybe fight again, then reconcile again. And after a while, you'll sort it out. A REBELLIOUS, MYSTERIOUS MAN DENIZ TUNALI "Deniz Tunalı thinks that who he is, his past and his dreams, are already in his work, and that if people knew who he was, it would damage the connection they have to his photography." "That's why he's hiding." "I don't agree with him, but I respect him, so I won't share his face with you." "My childhood friend and the man I love, the man I've been searching for for two years, will be in my heart always." "Although he is in all of the best memories from my adolescence, I ignored my true self because I was drowning in the complications of my adult life." "I forgot who I was." "Two years ago I saw a photo of his in an exhibition and I was mesmerized by it, because he reminded me of what I had forgotten." Sahra! - What is it, Ahu? - Why are you still in your pajamas? Are you going to wear this to your celebration dinner? I'm not going. What are you saying? Are you crazy? Is everything okay? I'm not! I'm not okay at all. I don't know how I can be okay. I don't care about the celebration or the promotion! Enough already. Enough. Pull yourself together. Get up! - Get up! We're going! - Stop. Ugh! Babe. Listen, 'kay? You need to get ready. Come to your senses, Sahra. No. I mean it, I know what I'm doing. I'm in too much pain, Ahu. You don't know how it feels. I'm no mood for a celebration, so back off. That's precisely why we need to go out tonight. To get you feeling good again. Come on, please. Let us help you okay? Everyone's really worried about you. You can't stay cooped up in here. What is the situation between you and Ulaş? I'm not sure. We didn't talk about the details. We'll see where it goes. - Because of me, you guys... - Don't be ridiculous. Look, we're fine. He told me about this place, actually. He's incredible. He's really helpful. Hello, everyone. Let's all raise a glass to Ms. Sahra and her promotion. I believe I have the right to comment. You're gonna expose your identity just to comment? I thought that I was buried inside your heart. No one can find me in there. But unlike you, I'm not afraid of being complete. Then tell me, why did you run? Why didn't you hear me out? Why didn't you wanna believe I'm in love? Why? Are you confessing? The article I wrote that brought you here was a confession. This is just a question. Do you want an answer?
