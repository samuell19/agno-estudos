Stop crying! Or i'll marry you off to ondal! Now you heard it. Now you have no tape, no evidence. See? Don't be silly. What? Do you think i have only one tape? What? Honey! Where are other tapes? Tell me! I'll find and destroy them all! Tell me where they are! Calm down. You crazy! Insane! You're losing your mind! Please! Calm down! You're going to kill our only daughter. Yeah, i'm crazy. My life is being threatened! How can i practice patience! No, i'll do anything. You believe the stupid psychic? You want to marry at 16? You're still a student! You can't marry now! I narrowly escaped from a rushing truck and horrible fire. Now i believe the psychic! I'll marry ondal! This is not kokuryo. Yes it was! Okay, do what you want. I don't care! I'll wait and see how happy your insane marriage will be! I'm sorry, mom. Sorry dad. See you. Where are you going? You can't go before you beat me. If i beat you, you have to give up. I don't want to. Are you scared? Then give up! No, i won't give up. Come on! Take me on! My little nephew marries before me. Where's my better half! At a fancy restaurant where classical music is played, i get beautiful flowers and... drink expensive french wine, put a big diamond ring on my finger. That's my ideal proposal day. In reality, i beg him to marry me! It's not fair! I can't do this! Of course i like him, but it's too much for me. I don't like to beg him! Okay, i can do it. No, i can't. Sorry, i was just about to push the button. My god! What happened to you? You're all wet! Come in, dear. My parents kicked me out. Why? Why at this late at night? I told them i'd marry ondal. What? Are you serious? I can never let him go to america. What are you talking about? I have to marry your son as soon as possible! Please! Come in. It's late at night and raining outside. Are you going to share your bed with me? In your dreams! You will, soon. Pyongang, it's just superstition. Don't take it seriously. Pyongang. I'll not go home. She's right. And you're too young to marry. It's not just superstition. I was almost killed! You can't force my son into marriage. I will never go back home! It's so good for you! Happy to hear that you go! No, you go! What are you doing? I'll go. Pyongang, ever since i met you, i've felt you are my destiny. The real ondal who will save you is me! Not that boy! Get out. Look at me in my eyes! I'm so sincere! You must be insane. In fact, my name was roh ondal. But mom changed my name later because it sounds so old. I told you to get out. Hadn't i changed my name, you wouldn't have failed to notice me! You keep nagging me. Pyongang! I'll not let you go! Get out of my way! Oh no! He deserves it. What's this? Shit! Where's ondal? You just screwed up my life! Damn, i mean you! Screwed up? What? I'll pull out every tooth out of your damn mouth. Open your mouth! Open it! You suck! Why are you so mad at me? Because you suck! You need to scrub harder. Something dirty is between your toes. It really sucks. I hate it! Ondal, ondal! Why? The tap broke down! I'll go downstairs to check! Shampoo bubbles in my eyes! They hurt my eyes! Help me! Wipe them with a towel. I can't see anything now. Wait, i'll get you one. Here you are. Where? Here. I can't see. Follow my voice. Here! Where? Here. Where? Here! Here! This one? Yes! Here? You touched it! Get it! I can't see it! Come in and help me. Are you crazy? I won't go in. Come in and help me. I won't. Why not? Why don't you com in? I won't! Never! Hey! You fool! You stupid! Pyongang, wake up! Hey! Get up! Are you breathing? Do you like it? You touched my breast! With both hands! I didn't mean it! You kissed me on my lips! It was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! So you didn't touch me or kiss me. Mr. Park! Stop it! Stop! Now i'm yours. Tell it to your parents! You're not mine. You neglect what you did to me. You did touch and kiss me. I'll tell it to your dad. Okay, i'll tell him tomorrow. Make sure to tell him. Or, i'll do that. I feel sleepy now. Good night! You have to tell it as it was. Mr. Park. Why? Well, i... dad, when are you going to be back home? I don't know. Why? Mr. Park? Have your breakfast, dad! Pyongang, what do you want to tell me? Nothing, sorry. Open your book, everyone. What's the empty seat? Roh chilsu's seat. Is he absent? No. So where he is? He's in the restroom. Quiet! Why is he still at the restroom? Is he constipated? No, it's his anus. He got an injury there he may need a lot more time. What do you mean? He got injured, i mean his anus. Well, here! Be quiet! Quiet! Ondal left school to prepare for his visit to america. Did he? Yeah. Gosh, why he's leaving now? Pyongang, you look tired. That makes me sad. Yusun. Look at me! Hey, piggy lady! I know you are smart. But everyone hates you! Wonkil! Sangho! Give it back to me! Give me! I'll get your swimsuits! What's this? Hold yourself straight! I took you to the pool to provide refreshment after the exam. But you're making troubles again! Na kongju! Kongju! Chilsu, here. How foolish! Hey you! You really want to die? You want to kill yourself? No. Then why do you attempt suicide? Nobody talks to me. Nobody cares me. Everyone hates me. I'd better die. Stop being silly. I understand you, but that doesn't justfy your suicide attempts. You know what it is like to live with counting your left days? I want to live! But the fear for death presses me! Come on. Pyongang kongju... we will be your friends. Thank you. Thank you very much. Girls... she spent quite a few days here. Her parents know that? I called them and told them not to worry. We should send her back her home! Poor pyongang! Yeah, she really is. She's dying so young. She feels sorry for her parents to leave them. Hi, everyone. This is "music box". We want letters from you. Write us about your life. Funny, heartwarming, or love stories, and whatever. We want them all. The address is yes! What? Tell all the other students in the school to write letters, send sms to the radio station and post the story on web boards. Yeah. You got it? I won't do that! I won't do anything that can benefit ondal! You! You missed me! Ha! Pyongang is poor indeed. But i can't do that! He can't make it, absolutely. Nurse teacher! Help me! Hurry up! Speed up there! Come on, watch the birdie! Hi! What's up! Hi. Hi, you girls. See you on sunday morning. See you then. Don't forget it! Hello, yes. This is hyesuk. I see. She is who's calling? Shh! Zip your mouth! Have your seat here. Sit here! Why? I'm reading your letters. Today, i have a special, heart-wrenching story. What's going on? Shh! Yu hyesuk, a high school student in seoul sent this letter to us. I'm a high school student in seoul i wrote this for my best friend, pyongang. She's dying now. You! She's dying from a rare disease, which hasn't been identified yet. A few days ago, she left her home. She did it for her poor parents. Her dad works at a construction site, mom runs a mom-and-pop store. She didn't want to put burdens on them. She called me when she left home. You okay? She asked me to tell her parents that she loved them. She wanted to send this word to her aunt, an old maid over 30. I don't know where she is. It's all for you. Wait! My dear friend left home for her beloved family. She may be wandering somewhere, or lying on cold streets. She loves her family. But now she's dying young alone. Hoping she's listening to this, i'd tell her i love her. Such a heart-wrenching story. Now hyesuk is on the line. Hello? Hi. Did you find your friend? Yes, i did. What a relief. Where she's now? Hey! At her boyfriend's home. Is she okay now? Don't make any noise. She's in critical condition. Is there any cure for her? Yes, we have one. But there's a problem. What problem? I'm her another friend. The cure is to make love with ondal before april 23 and bear a child in a year. But ondal doesn't want to do so even after kissing and touching her! You crazy! You spoiled it! It's okay? I'll go home tomorrow. What? You did make a good decision. Thank you for caring me. I told you she would go home. You didn't. You got it i asked for? Here. Push the button. Yeah. It's time to go bed! You fool! You're damn stupid. Lie down on your knees! Raise a bit! Don't fart, please! Shut up! Raise your back! We got it wrong. Go down! Yeah! I see her! My love pyongang, cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Cu~~ckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo. Cuckoo. Hey you! You are the cuckoo bird? You? You avoided it? A tomato is flying in your face! What? Tomato? Shit!

Bitch! Cuckoo, cuckoo. Get the damn fruit! What happened? Wake up! You deserve it. Come in. You're still staying up. As you see now. What are you staring at? Stars. Stars? What stars? You're really going home tomorrow? Look at the sky. Sky? Why? It's so beautiful. What? It's rose nebula. We can't see it now with the naked eye. But we can see it with a telescope. It's an eternal rose that never falls. It's forever beautiful as love. Yes, beautiful. If you want to find your real love, it will appear before you someday. We're still too young. Let's wait till we grow up. Love doesn't wait! Seize the day, you know. Yeah, but what are you doing? I'm locking up the door. What? Why? To seize the day! Stop it! No, i can't. I want to save my life. I don't give up you! Wait, please. I have something to tell you. You do? Yes! No more excuse. You did kissed me and touched my breast, you remember? But you fainted! I don't need your excuse anymore. Take it easy. Come on! Please! Stop! Don't do that! Cuckoo, cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. It's too different from my expectation. What do you mean? - You exceeded it - hey! I wonder if princess pyongang made love with ondal at their first night. That's more than enough! Anyway thank you for saving me! I won't die in a year, at least. I lost my chastity. Don't be silly. Darling. Stop! Don't tickle me. I did it for my love. You know what love is? I did it for my love! Did for what? You fool, boys.
