Maxim Gorky Central Film Studio for Children and Youth. The earlier stages of an operation launched by Soviet counterintelligence... were depicted in the film The Secret Agent’s Blunder. Still not talking? I don’t think that’s in your best interest. – Can I ask you a question? – Sure. What would you say if, under similar circumstances, one of your agents were to start talking? I’d say he was a traitor. So why are you pushing now? You’ve got no one to betray... and you know it. On that subject... did you know that your father’s death wasn’t by natural causes, but because of a car accident? And your bosses are connected to it. Why should I believe you? You can believe me or not. Vadim Gavrilovich, the newspapers, please. Frankfurter Rundschau, headline: “Who Killed Count Tulyev?” New York Times: “Accident or Murder?” And Le Figaro puts it directly: Evidently, the real reason for Tulyev’s death, and the mysterious disappearance of his manuscript, was the Count’s recent decision... to have Agence France-Presse publish his memoirs. It appears that, in some countries, there are certain circles... which aren’t interested in the old spy’s honest story seeing the light of day. Indeed, perhaps least interested of all... would be NATO intelligence. Still don’t believe me? I’m tired. Come on in. THE SECRET AGENT’S DESTINY. Written by O. SHMELYOV and V. VOSTOKOV.

And no calls. Our postcard to Privolzhsk was returned. Apparently he’s moved out of his house, but hasn’t registered again with the Address Bureau. It’s possible that he’s only just moved... He’s supposed to let us know what’s going on. It’s not like Hope. Are you worried? And are you so sure that everything about Krug’s return... worked out as well as you think? Hope reported that Snipe arrived. “Reported.” When’s the next radio contact? – Tomorrow. – Ask about his address. And write down this message... Satellite surveillance shows... that major construction... is underway in quadrant 72-48. But, dear Hope, there’s nothing there, nor will there be for the foreseeable future. But why would they say so? Is their information wrong? Look at the transcript. What catches your eye? It’s absolutely certain. There’s no “probably,” or “some data indicates”... That area is an empty plain. So what do you think is going on? I think... they’re worried that Hope has screwed something up. – Some kvass? – No thanks. They’ve given us an open invitation to feed them disinformation. But if they do start getting bad information, their suspicions will have been justified. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that they asked about the address. It means they’re worried, and could send someone out. Sounds that way. So maybe Tulyev should stay with me for a little while, in Privolzhsk. If they’re worried, they’ll want confirmation soon. Too risky. Let’s just wait. There’s nothing we can do. You’ll have to handle it on your own. Just deal with any visitors. Go to Privolzhsk. Get registered. And get Hope registered, too. – Both of us? – Yes, and get him a job. Now write down this radio message. According to some indirect data which I am confirming, your information about the U-235 is incorrect. “Moved to new apartment.” And he gave the address. You’ve been to Moscow, right? Yes... July ’44. Do you remember it very well? You’ve been wanting to take a vacation, right? Book yourself on a flight to Moscow. – The bags go to the tenth floor. – You got it. Is it your first time in Moscow, Mr. Kruger? Yes it is. How long are we staying here, miss? Three days now, and one more on the way back. Is this the embassy? I’d like to speak to the cultural attaché, Mr. Klots. I’m calling to say hello from your cousin in Köln, Mr. Koh. I can meet anytime. Rachmaninoff. A magnificent recording. Is it from here? And how do you like this piece? Yes, I noticed it. Is it special, as well? And here I have something rare indeed. Seventh century. The prophet Ilyas. I know someone who can get more masterpieces like these. Old people die, and to young people it’s just junk. It’s rather warm in here. How’s my cousin doing? Good, but his back hurts him sometimes. It’s his wartime souvenir. – Would you like some coffee? – Yes, please, but not too strong. Well I think I can help you... to make some additions to your collection, Mr. Kruger. I’d be very appreciative. Need someone to go Privolzhsk, to check on Kurnakov. We’ll look into your interests. – I don’t smoke. – It’s my gift to you. It’s a camera! I’ll be back in Moscow in a week. Please see what you can find out about those icons. I will. Anybody home? Yes. – House twenty-one? – Twenty-one. The landlady has gone shopping, though. No, I’m here to see Kurnakov. Is he here? He’s not home, either. – Where is he? – Away on business. – For how long? – I think about a week. What bad luck! I went to the radio repair shop. They said he’d quit. And they gave me this address. So all this trouble for nothing. Yes, he quit, and he was absolutely right. Why work there? The check was tiny and the work was frantic, so he quit. Now he’s a driver at the local Transport Agency. – He can make better money there! – Absolutely. He shuttles between a couple places, enjoys the fresh air and scenery, and gets all kinds of bonuses and commissions. – Have a cigarette. – Thanks, I don’t smoke. – What, you want to live a long time? – Depends. Actually, I’m here on an errand. My friend asked me to say hi for him. So I’ve come for nothing. If you want to leave a message, I can give it to him. We’re friends. Say hi to him for Sergey Nikolayevich, from Bolshaya Polyanka. Okay, you got it. Alright, I gotta go. Could I offer you a martini for the road? – I hate to wet my whistle alone. – What’s that mean? You know, drinking alone. When only the bottle keeps you company. Sorry, I can’t stay. Besides, I’m on a diet. I want to live a long time, too. – Bye. – Tough luck. Okay, see you. What news do you have? He quit the radio repair shop. Now he’s a driver at the local Transport Agency. You confirmed that? We went to his home, and to his work. Who gave you this information? This guy. He lives next door. Says they’re friends. He said Kurnakov is away on business. When’s he coming back? In a week, supposedly. Send a message to HQ, saying Kurnakov wasn’t around. – Do you know him? – No, I don’t. I guess you don’t spend much time at the Moscow bath house, then. As the Russians say... I know those words of wisdom. “The steam won’t hurt your bones.” Anyway, we got some information about him. I think he can be of use to you. As for this photo, you’d better keep it. – Has something happened? – No, not yet. But things change. You may end up having to take him out. Put this back where it belongs. If they’re worried enough to send somebody out, they won’t drop it until they’ve seen Tulyev. We can’t keep his arrest secret from them for long. They’ll send somebody else, or they’ll go to the Transport Agency. – Everything’s fine there. – Maybe, but they still won’t back down. True. We’ll have to show Tulyev to them. – When’s the next radio contact? – Tomorrow. Send this: Got a hello from Bolshaya Polyanka... – From Sergey Nikolayevich. – Yeah, but not directly, through Snipe. Further meetings in Privolzhsk are not desirable. If there’s an emergency, provide a Moscow address. This notepad was found when we searched your house. What do the words in capitals mean? TIP, DIN, AK...? Those are the initials of people I can rely on. How did you select them? Some were compromised, here or abroad. Others were dissatisfied, ambitious, or just loved money. Morally unstable, so to speak. Were you recruiting operatives? Sometimes, when that was needed. How were they to be used? Mostly for sabotage, when the time came. – And when is that, exactly? – In a war. What were their orders? Their orders were devised by NATO, as part of an overall strategy... against the Warsaw Pact countries. Their mission would be to disrupt... gas, electric, water and food supplies. And to prepare for the arrival of special forces units. And what’s their purpose? To conduct mass-terror operations, and to engage in hostile actions... in order to end the Soviet regime. How was all that to be accomplished? Through the most advanced means available, including bacteriological warfare. Personally, I never considered such a war possible. You didn’t? But you still worked for those who believe that war... is the most efficient way... of resolving international conflicts. I’m a spy. It’s my profession. I couldn’t disobey orders. As for political... I never cared about political agendas. Very convenient perspective. We’ve heard it before. “It’s Hitler’s fault. He gave the orders. We’re just pawns.” Right? I guess so. You know, recently... I’ve started to look back on my life. We’ve given you a reason to reflect? You mean because of my arrest? No, not really. It began sometime prior. When I was leaving for this mission, my father said, What irony! You, the last of the Tulyevs, have to sneak back to our homeland. And what’s more, under a false identity. But I envy you. If I could have, I’d have crawled back to Russia on my hands and knees. Back then, his words seemed sentimental to me. What’s the big deal about where you live, much less die. And yet, everywhere we went... and to everyone we met, we were always exiles. It seems that only now do I really understand my father. Russia is our homeland, and I can’t––I hate... to be its, and its people’s, enemy. It’s hard to convey. But you probably... find that difficult to understand. Why didn’t you come to us with these thoughts earlier? Maybe you were just too quick to arrest me. Do you have any personal requests? I’d like to write to Maria, but... Do it. – From Mikhail? – Yes. – Have you seen him? – Yes. Everything is in there. Don’t tell anyone about this letter, and don’t show it to anyone else. Okay. If you want to write back, I’ll come back at five. Okay? – Yes. I’ll walk you out. – It’s okay. See you later. Hi Masha, my darling. They allowed me to write you. I don’t know if you’ll want to read this, but... it’s important to me that you do. Where shall I begin... Alright, what else... Sasha goes to preschool now. He likes it. He cries when I come to take him home. He doesn’t want to go. I’ll include a photo, so you can see how he looks now. Attention. Flight 943, Moscow to Zaporizhia, is now boarding. Attention. Flight 943, Moscow to Zaporizhia, is now boarding. Passengers are requested to go to the gate for boarding. Gate number one. Alexander Nikolayevich! I can’t believe you didn’t miss the flight, or mess something else up. Yulia, I almost did. I thought you were arriving at Sheremetyevo. Meet my new friend. – Rimma. – Alec. We spent our vacation together. Okay, here’s the car. Hop in. That felt great! Why haven’t you come to the bath house before? I was quite satisfied with a bathtub. But with age, it seems my bones demand steam. – Have you been an attendant long? – About fifteen years now. I guess you’ve seen a lot of of birch leaves in your time! Birch leaves and bastards, we got ’em all. I’ve got two professors, four doctors, and about five artists among my clients. You know the actor Pugovkin? He’s my client. He’s a regular guy. Doesn’t even drink beer. Of course they’re all different. See that one over there, sitting down... – With the thermos? – Yes, the one about to drink. You think he’s drinking tea? Nope, five star cognac. He’s a big shot, director of a big grocery store. He’ll be in jail soon. Is it written on his face? I’ve got an eye for it. His buddy, a supply agent, is already behind bars. Shortly before his arrest, he also took up cognac after a steam. He used to be happy with beer. This one recently made the change, too. A sure sign that he’s heading for jail. I see you’re a real psychologist. My work requires it. It’s high time we switch to cognac, as well. Come on, Nikolai Nikolayevich. I see it differently. I say nothing beats a good strong tea... after the bath house. Are you working much longer? I’m free in thirty minutes. Well, I’d be happy to join you for some tea. I used to have a buddy, a lion tamer in the circus. Last year one of his cats ate him alive. He used to say, “It’s all in our hands.” – Right, but the lion still ate him. – Every last bone. I live nearby. Come and be my guest. – Okay, you got it. – I’ll be finished soon. So in 1944 I was wounded, and pretty shell-shocked, too. I was in the hospital a long time. When I finally got out... I went back to my village in Oryol. It was devastated. Just burnt chimneys where houses had been. Well, what to do, Nikolai Nikolayevich? So I headed for Moscow. Got a job as a janitor, and they gave me this palace. – It’s not so bad. – And I began my life anew. Then a friend of mine helped me get a job at the bath house. It’s very clean there, at least. And that’s the story of my life. Yeah, a lot of things happened in the war. I knew a guy... who lived in a village in Oryol, too. Together with his brother, Kondrat. They were doing alright. Then in 1941 they both went off to war. They were surrounded by Germans near Kharkov, and Kondrat was killed by a landmine. Vasily buried his brother, but didn’t return to his platoon. Instead, he surrendered to the Germans. He got tired of yelling “attack!” and rushing into battles, I guess. The Germans sent him to Oswiecim, but not to the concentration camp there, to a spy school. And that’s how he became agent number 75... in Operation Zeppelin. He got the nickname Quiet. Served in the punitive forces, in the SS Sonderkommando 10-A. Was involved in operations in Krasnodar and Mozer. Then he got sick. I don’t remember what it was. The Germans left him in some village, made him chief of police. And the next day, our troops liberated the town. Quite unfortunate timing. He had to hide away, down in his girlfriend’s cellar. He stayed down there, in the cellar, until 1946. Didn’t dare come out. Guys were coming back from the war, and he was still hiding down there. And then his girlfriend kicked him out. She got tired of him. There were better guys around by then. But thank God she didn’t turn him in, at least. So he headed for Moscow, and took a job as a janitor. And here we are... That’s just how life goes, Vasily. Sorry, I mean Kondrat. Why are you staring at me? You did take your brother’s name. You’re wrong. You mistake me for someone else. Unfortunately, I’m not wrong, and I know exactly who you are. Look. Here. A choice made of your own free will. – Where did you get these? – Doesn’t matter. I don’t need them. You can burn them if you want. Let’s forget it, Vasily. I’ve got a proposal for you. Don’t worry, it won’t undermine the Soviet government or anything. I deal in gemstones. Gemstones? My clients are very respectable people... Look, it’s a simple job. Just deliver a package for me. You’ll be compensated, too. Deal? Do you know this man? No, I don’t. Do the directors trust you? My chief does. How long have you known him? I’ve worked with him for fifteen years. I know he lived in Argentina before the war. His German is hardly perfect. He’s a distant relative of Gehlen’s. That explains his stratospheric career, I guess. – And what about Sebastian? – Sebastian... He only showed up recently. He’s been suspicious of everyone from the very first day. He hated my father. Why’s that? He replaced my father in his position. Actually, Sebastian... sees a potential enemy in every Russian. Is he from the United States? I don’t know. He was sent by the CIA. I met him in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, at a spy training school there. Did you go there often? Three times. To select agents for work in Iran and Turkey. Speaking of your missions in Asia and the Middle East, do you recall any secret locations or passwords that were used? Yes, a few. Did you work with any of these agents directly? Two in Istanbul... and one who’s in Athens now. It was so long ago. I wonder if they’re still alive. Do you know any other agents in Europe? My chief asked me to meet with a man in Brussels. It was a personal request. Who was he? As far as I know, he was studying in Paris. During the occupation, he collaborated with the Germans, and was sentenced to death by partisans. But he escaped to Belgium, and for the last few years, was running some big laboratory there. – But then he left. – Where to? Either West Germany or Switzerland. Can you describe him? Yes. In tomorrow’s meeting, please. – Alec. – Yes, Yulia. I’ve gotta get off my feet. I’ve been to the plant, the editors’ board, and the institute. – Take off your shoes. – Yes ma’am. I got a telegram from my mom. Our archeologist is freezing on his trip. He wants us to send him some warm clothes. Asked me to say hi to you, too. Thanks. It’s a real Versailles. This place has never looked better. If you make a mess now, you have to clean it up yourself. Got it. – Your jacket. – Sorry. Have you read the new Literaturnaya Gazeta? It’s right there in black and white: Men need to be supported. How do you feel about that? Quite negatively, actually. It’s just an excuse to be lazy. You say that, and you want me to marry you? You want it more than I do. But if it happens, you’ll still be the head of the house, Alexander Nikolayevich. Don’t leave your keys with your neighbor anymore. She pokes her nose into everything. – What? – Who am I? Are we married? – And you said? – I said I’m your lover. Idiotic... – Ready for some steak and onions? – Sure. Rimma got you some translation work, but just technical stuff. That’s fine, as long as it pays. By the way, Volodya is going abroad for a little while. Seems like everybody goes abroad now. Where to? Either Belgium or Switzerland. For work, with just a few other people. That’s so much better than in a herd of tourists. I agree. So what do you think? What are you talking about? I thought your brain ran like clockwork. He could bring us something back. Like what? Like French perfume, or maybe some mascara. A decent necktie or a suede coat wouldn’t be terrible, either. Let me get it straight. Exactly what do you have in mind? You’d have to get some foreign currency. What do you mean, get foreign currency? Like it’s caviar, or herring. Get it yourself. You’re so slow. Don’t you see? Thank you. You’re friends with that lawyer, Koka, right? I’m sure he can get it. I know it. – What do you know? – Ask him, please. Cut that crap out. Don’t even say his name! He’s not my friend, and never has been. What’s gotten into you? So he’s not your friend, but he is my neighbor. He’s the one who introduced us. You could show a little more appreciation, out of gratitude or something. Fine, go make out with your neighbor. How quickly your true nature comes out. Rimma gets you translations. Why can’t you help her out? Right, so now I should do it for Rimma. To hell with your friend, if she’s anything like you! – Why are you yelling? – I’m tired of your talk about fancy stuff! You never quit. “Go buy this, go get that.” I’ve had enough. Maybe you’re tired of me, too? Maybe. Fine, we’ll get it without you. I don’t recommend getting mixed up with Koka. Thanks for the advice. Yulia, what a surprise. I wasn’t expecting you. This is my friend, Rimma. Pleased to meet you. I’ll be right back. Make yourselves comfortable. First Alec stopped coming by, and lately you have, too. Don’t be such a stranger, my dear neighbor. Sit down, please. We’ve come to ask you a favor. But don’t start with business right away. Do you want to spoil all the pleasure of your company? Let’s not rush. Let’s just sit and talk. I happen to have some nice wine. And I’m meeting Rimma for the first time. It’s all so exciting. – Here you are. – Thank you. I know it’s supposed to be good manners to ask about your health first, and only then ask you to lend me ten rubles, but on the contrary, I think that would actually be rude. – Do you need money? – Yes, but not ten rubles. Kopecks, hundred ruble notes, thousand ruble notes, you name it! We need dollars. Dollars... Where does one get dollars? They’re not lying in the street. Surely you know where to get them. You have so many connections. And why do you need them, if it’s not a secret? You know... Thank you. Rimma can explain. My friend is an engineer. He travels abroad for work. His mother is sick and needs medicine, but it’s not available here. Isn’t your engineer worried about smuggling foreign currency across the border? A lot of people do that these days. You’re wrong, very few. Please, we’re asking you to help us. I can’t do anything. I’d like to help, but I can’t. It’s not in my capacity. Okay, let’s drink. Nikolai Nikolayevich, we’re sorry, but we have to go. Rimma, dear, you’re here for the first time, but must be off so soon... such a pity. I’m sorry I couldn’t help you. Girls, here you are. – Thank you. – Forgive me, for Christ’s sake. I hope it’s not the last time. I enjoyed meeting you. Wait, Yulia, I almost forgot. Can I have a word with you? Rimma, excuse me. Why didn’t you come on your own? There are some things you can’t talk about in front of other people. Rimma is my close friend and the money is for her, but I understand. Sorry. How many dollars does that medicine cost? Two hundred, or two fifty. One of my acquaintances recently returned from a business trip. He’s probably got some cash left, but two hundred dollars... I’ll find out and see what I can do for you. – What’s her friend’s name? – Volodya Barkov. Ask this Volodya Barkov to meet me. – Should he come here? – No, somewhere else would be better. Let’s make it the day after tomorrow, at the main post office on Kirovskaya. Just point him out to me, then leave. Thank you. – See you. – Bye. Window 54. Tall, grey hair. Nikolai Nikolayevich. I’ll wait for you in the subway. Nikolai Nikolayevich, hi. Volodya, it’s been so long! You’re tan. Been having a good time? I’ll be right back. Go on, I’ll catch up with you. Nikolai Nikolayevich Kazin. Here you are. If it hadn’t been for Yulia’s neighborly relations... – You’ve got them on you? – Yes. In the store, put yours in my pocket and I’ll put mine in yours. – Sit. Hi. – Hi. – Catching up on some reading? – Yeah, making up for lost time. Right, you had no time before. I’d say I had better things to do before. Do you get newspapers and magazines regularly? Yes, thank you. I’ve got some interesting reading material of my own. Came in yesterday. Hope: Go to Moscow Museum of Fine Arts, “Greek Patio” room, from 5 to 5:30 PM. Next radio contact due on 9th, at usual time. – Phony? – No. – So is this an official invitation? – Quite. And so the game goes on. Yes, they want to see you. They’ve been missing you badly. We can’t deny them. Seems like they don’t trust you. I don’t think that’s it. They’re probably worried that I’ve been replaced. – You must go to the museum. – You trust me? And if not? Anyway, you don’t have a choice. If only my old chief knew who sent me. I’d give anything to see his face. Same here. Excuse me, monsieur, do you know what century this sculpture is from? The sculptor is unknown, but such lovely bronze. Monsieur, you’re very lovely, too. Bye. – Free? – Taken. – To Yaroslavsky station. – Hey, taxi! The Moscow-Privolzhsk train departs at 6:00 PM... To Privolzhsk? Yes, car three. Hold on. Did you recognize anybody? No one I know. – Thank you. – You’re welcome. Is the tape ready? Mikhail Alexandrovich, watch the screen, please. Sit, sit. Maybe you’ll recognize one of the museum visitors. As I already said, I didn’t recognize anyone I know. But someone had be there. That much is certain. Otherwise there would have been no point. Sure. Play it again. No. No. No. Wait, could you play that part back? Play the last part again. The final bit again. Sebastian. – Are you sure? – Absolutely. And the other guy? – I don’t know him. – You’ve never met him? – You’ve never see him before? – No. When you left the museum, he followed you. See him? You took a taxi, and this car waited for him for an hour. He followed you to the train station. There it is, license plate 59-88. He went to the platform and waited until your train left. Probably making sure I went back to Privolzhsk. But I don’t know him. Okay, thank you. – Yevgeny Ivanovich, take him back. – Yes sir. – See you. – See you. He recognized Sebastian. He’s the one who interrogated you. Right, the chief’s right hand. Sebastian arrived as a tourist from West Germany, under the name Kruger. Erich Kruger. Maybe he didn’t know the other guy. We identified the other one. He’s Friedrich Klots. He’s been to our country twice before: In 1959 as a tourist, and in 1962 with a trade delegation. He’s with the embassy, a cultural attaché. Specializes in antiques. After leaving the station, he met Kazin at the Valday café. We showed these photos to Stupen. He claims it’s Klots whom he met at Kazin’s place. Hope: All well. You were seen. Get new cipher from Akulov. He is an attendant at the Central Bath House in Moscow. Approach him on behalf of Nikolai Nikolayevich... and offer a pack of Novost cigarettes. Confirm your receipt of new cipher. The call signs are the same as before. You’ll hear from us every Tuesday and Thursday, same time. God help you. – So how is it? – Here, like new. – Thanks. – I’ll hang it up. Great birch leaves you have here! They smell like that cologne, Dream. – 65 kopecks for ironing. – No problem. I was sent by... Nikolai Nikolayevich. Have a smoke. – No smoking here. – Come on. – I’ll go get your laundry. – Okay. The Sandunovsky bath house was always my favorite. The pool is bigger there. But the heat is better here, drier. You should come by more often. I’d be afraid that magpies would carry me off to their nest. How about a beer? – Can you get something stronger? – It’s all in our hands. Okay, time to say goodbye. No crying, please. Remember, I’m size 42 and she’s a 46. I got it. It adds up to 88. – It’ll all work out fine. – Don’t forget to call. Of course I’ll call. Enjoy yourselves. – Thank you. – You’re welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, radio listeners and TV viewers, our city is hosting an electronics symposium, opening tomorrow. A delegation from the USSR has just arrived, headed by one Professor Vasnetsov. Good day, Professor. What are your expectations for the symposium? – Great successes. – Good luck. Professor Vendel, so nice to see you. Please meet my colleague, Mr. Barkov. And you’ve already met Mr. Couturie. He’s our managing director. He’ll show you around. And this is my assistant, Josephine Clair. – And what about Professor Klaus? – He’s right here. How are you? Pretty good, actually, thanks to a small car accident recently. He’s been riding a bike since the accident. – Have you read my book? – Yes I have. It’s very interesting. So you’re ready to debate? I’d sooner agree with the professor than with you. Monsieur Barkov? Yes, Vladimir. Judging by your name, you must be French? Yes. Do you speak French? A little better than English... Today you have some free time. The symposium begins tomorrow at 10:00 AM. I’ll have a car pick you up in the morning. Gentlemen, I hope you’ll be comfortable here. – Thank you. – You’re welcome. Here’s the symposium program. Professor, you speak on Tuesday. And Mr. Barkov, on Friday. We’ll let you know the exact times shortly. If you need anything, I’m at your disposal. – Here you go. – Thank you. – My phone number. – Thank you. – Have a good rest. See you. – Take care. Mr. Couturie, can I ask you a favor? I’d like to buy something, for a girl. Could you recommend a good place? Well, we have a lot of nice stores... Try The Passage, two blocks from here. They carry all kinds of stuff. – Can I give you a ride? – No, thanks. Then have a good night––I mean, day. Perhaps I can help? Yes, I’m glad to see you here. I thought you might run into trouble. – Do you like it? – I think it’s beautiful. – Would you mind trying it on? – I’d be happy to. – Do you like it? – It’s gorgeous. – He says it’s beautiful. – I’ll take it. I’d also like to get a suede coat, but one size smaller. I see! The gentleman has a big heart. Bring the coat and some coffee, please. And cognac, too. According to Russian tradition, we have to drink to the sale. – Have you ever been to Belgium? – Unfortunately, no. That’s where I’m from, originally. I only moved here recently. Monsieur Couturie is my dad’s friend. He helped me land this job with Professor Vendel. There are some very beautiful places here, lakes and mountains... You really should see them. And I’m ready to be your guide. I’m afraid I won’t have any time. Our schedule is already overloaded. – But you’ve got Sunday. – Just one day. If only you could stay for at least a month... What’s the time, please? Four o’clock. I’m sorry, but I have to go. The professor has one bad habit. Sometimes he works quite late. – Have you worked for him for long? – Not very. The professor travels often, and I accompany him. It’s the only opportunity... for an unmarried woman to do something interesting with her life. – Is that a book of Prévert’s poetry? – Yes. Remember Barbara It rained all day in Brest that day. And you walked smiling Flushed, enraptured, dripping wet. In the rain Remember Barbara. The Russian language is so beautiful. But I only understood Barbara. Psi-one and psi-two are phase shifts, resulting from reflection. And this is the overlapping phase, while passing through the planar layer. Thus, assuming the calculations are correct, and you agree our reasoning is sound, then we have cause for celebration. If I may add, I’m not the sole author of this discovery. It’s been a collective effort, and our team has chosen to share... the fruits of its research with you. Thank you for your attention. Esteemed colleagues, I’m sure you’ll agree... that the presentation given by this young Soviet engineer... was quite illuminating. He posed a question... and presented a solution that was refreshing, as well as innovative. And now, let’s take a break. Congratulations. Well done. Could Mr. Barkov meet with my students? I’m afraid we won’t have time. If Professor Vendel were to contact Moscow, and request that I stay longer? Of course, we can arrange that. I don’t object, but Moscow has to say yes. Allow me to introduce you to Professor Klaus. Congratulations on a brilliant presentation. He’d like to invite you to his institute, to discuss your findings in more detail. Thank you. I have to check with Professor Vasnetsov, though. He looks forward to meeting again. Congratulations, Mr. Barkov. You were quite a success... Volodya. I’m sorry to be late. I was working on your updated itinerary. – I’m happy you’re staying. – Me too. Ms. Josephine, what took you so long? A gift for you. I brought Mr. Barkov’s new itinerary. Volodya, I’d like to discuss something with you. The itinerary includes a free day, and Professor Vendel suggested I take you out to the lakes. Sounds lovely. And don’t forget, you’re invited to dinner at the professor’s next Friday. – Will you be there? – It’s just for researchers and their guests. – I see. We’re too boring for you. – That’s not it. Then you’ll come as my guest? Well, if you insist... Hope: Have Snipe take train nine from Moscow on the 12th. Photograph the train station 30 km outside Novotrubinsk. Place a measuring device on the tracks there, and retrieve it after ten days. Akulov has the device and instructions. God help you. I got the gadget. The instructions say it measures... the radioactivity levels of passing trains. Novotrubinsk again. If they were so intent on getting water and soil samples from there... it’s hardly a surprise that they want more information. According to what Tulyev said, they think there’s a nuclear weapons facility there. – How far off are they? – Only about 800 kilometers. The Americans asked twice for permission to go hunting there. And the Turkish ambassador has never hunted in his life, but suddenly he’s desperate to see the taiga, too. You denied their requests, and that only fanned the flames. Okay, let’s say they figure out... there’s nothing there. Samples were supposedly taken twice, by you and Stupen. Both times they showed elevated radioactivity, and suddenly there’s nothing there. We should’ve thought of that before. We’re appealing to your agency’s expertise for a very important... and absolutely secret request. There are no military resources in this area. The construction there is entirely civilian. But our task is... to disguise the area... so there will appear to be... a nuclear weapons facility there. We must assume that... those who are interested in this place... can utilize reconnaissance satellites, aerial surveillance, and radio communications, along with their network of agents. So a team posing as a construction crew will accompany you, and the whole area will be cordoned off. It can be quite difficult to get a clear image. And I’m telling you, it’s reality. My dear Mr. Barkov, you can’t just declare the desirable to be reality. But the measurements don’t lie. Yes, we get the same measurements... from our ferroelectric instruments... and from the SuperCon system. Admittedly, our technique isn’t perfect yet. At times, it’s impossible to know the significance of each measurement. Why make it so complicated? In my country, we say it’s like scratching your left ear with your right hand. Only film made with liquid tellurium crystals... can produce the desired result. I can’t agree. We conducted the same experiments, but with zero results. What do you mean? Our tests paid off handsomely, although it would take some time to explain. Good evening, Frau Vendel. You look very nice. You look lovely, as well. Excuse me, gentlemen. I’m happy to see you. Have you had a lot to drink? – No, just a little. – You totally forgot about me. Professor Klaus’s attention is so focused, he’ll keep anybody sober. Get me out of here. This so boring. If it’s alright with Professor Vendel, mademoiselle Josephine and I will depart. Such a pity. – What are you thinking about? – About you... and our trip to the lakes. It would’ve been so lonely there without you. And you? I’m thinking that Friday is in two days, and then you’re going away. And I’ll be alone again. I’ve grown so used to you. Mr. Couturie told me that Professor Klaus... offered you a job at his institute, and you turned him down. Is that such a surprise? What would you do in my place? I don’t know... I’d probably have chosen differently. The music stopped. No, it’s still playing. This is where I live. Are you saying good night? No. But my landlady is very strict. This is my parlor. It’s not a parlor, but a palace. And I’m the queen here. Your cloak, your majesty. Shall we have a drink? Look in the cabinet. We’ll have the drink of the sun. Josie, without you I would’ve missed this country’s most beautiful sights. And it was a pleasure to be your guide. Sit down, please. Come to Moscow, Josie. Volodya, you’re just like every other guy. You wouldn’t even recognize me in Moscow. I could never forget you. Stop it, Volodya. You’re leaving regardless. What am I supposed to do? You’re an amazing woman. Who is it? Josephine, open up, please. I was in bed already, Frau Mertin. It’s quite urgent. It’s my landlady. I don’t want her to see you. Hide in here. – Criminal police. – Sit down, please. What is it? According to Interpol, your name is Georgette Hemlin, and you’re wanted for drug smuggling. There’s been a mistake. I’ve never heard of any Georgette Hemlin. I work for Professor Vendel. Will he confirm that? Yes. His phone number? You know, he wouldn’t appreciate being disturbed so late at night. Is there someone else who can vouch for you? Our director, Philip Couturie. Please dial his number and I’ll talk to him. Do you know Ms. Josephine Clair? I need you to come to the police station immediately. Get your coat. You’re coming with us. What are you waiting for? Search the room. Who’s this gentleman? Mr. Barkov, an engineer from the Soviet Union. Strange place to receive guests. Your passport, please. – My passport is at the hotel. – Which one? You’re coming with us, too. Let’s go. Care for one? No. She seemed like such a nice woman. I don’t know what to say to Professor Vendel. I pulled the strings to get her that job. But Monsieur Volodya, don’t worry. Everything is fine. I spoke with the commissioner. He won’t notify your embassy, and you won’t be mentioned in the report. – I’ll take you back. – No, thanks. I think I’ll go for a walk. Good night. Don’t do it. Life is beautiful. – Fresh air. – Don’t catch a cold. We had two of our agents... take photos of this location. The photos were taken at different times, but they correspond. They also match the photo you provided, Mr. MacLeod. Our satellite detects significant radioactivity... in that area. Our instrument indicates that freight trains... loaded with radioactive materials pass through regularly. All of our diplomatic efforts... to get permission to visit the area have been denied. Our experts believe the exterior construction is just a front, and that the actual facility is hidden underground. If you’re lucky enough to learn anything new, we’d appreciate hearing about it. We’ve told our agent to provide... anything he can find out. I suggest making the same request to your military attaché. A Soviet delegation, headed by Professor Vasnetsov, recently attended an electronics symposium here. We have reason to believe... that their research... will form a major component of... an anti-missile system that’s being developed... for all of the USSR’s major industrial centers, starting with Moscow. I think you understand. We must strike the first blow. I agree with you. For a similar system in the USA, as part of the Safeguard program, the estimated expense is between 70 and 100 million dollars. We know you tried something with the Soviets at the symposium. We’d appreciate some details about what happened. Sebastian, get the Philip Couturie file, please. And ask them to bring us some more coffee. My boss would like to talk with you. How about Tuesday, at our site in Garmisch-Partenkirchen? We’ll buy twenty pieces of your equipment. The terms of delivery can be settled later. We got a few photos. Who’s this? Barkov. He works at Professor Vasnetsov’s institute. I suggest keeping an eye on him. END OF PART ONE
