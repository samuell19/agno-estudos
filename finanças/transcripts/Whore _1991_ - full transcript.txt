Come here. How you doing? Fine. You a cop? No. Why, are you? No. You want a date? How much? How much you got to spend? It depends on what you do. ( scoffs ) I have sex. I give head, half and half. And I do domination. Uh, is that all? ( scoffs ) What do you mean "is that all"? What the hell you want, a hand job? I wanna fuck you up the ass. You can stick it up your own, asshole. ( laughs ) I would if I could, bitch. - Bastard! - ( horn honks ) Fucking jerkoff! - Jesus, you hear the mouth on that guy? - ( horn honks ) Could just imagine what it would be like if he had me alone. - ( horn honks ) - I mean, if he can't treat me like a lady out here on the street, he sure ain't gonna treat me like one - when he gets my pants down, now, is he? - ( man retching ) ( gags ) Oh, God. - Ugh. - What? What are you looking at? Why don't you find a toilet, huh? - Why don't you find a bed? - I'm trying to, but you ain't exactly attracting business, you know what I mean? - Want a date? ( retches ) - Ugh. I wasn't gonna kiss you. - ( horn honks ) - Ugh. Jesus Christ. - I know the rule. - This place is a fucking dive! I wish I hadn't come here. Spare some change for Ras? No! Don't vex me, sister. Me got something for you. - What? - Come, come. Me show. ( horn honks ) - Come. Look. - What are you doing? - What's the matter with you? - ( glass shatters ) - ( gasps ) - For just one dollar, sister, I'm walking on real broken glass. No, don't! Don't do it! - You breaking me concentration. - Here. Take it, take it! I don't care. Just have it. Ah! There's a guy on the other side of the street. He's probably into blood. Jesus. If there's two things I don't need is a guy puking on one side of the street and bleeding on the other. - Can you believe what he was gonna do for a-- - ( horn honks ) You know, this isn't my territory. I'm sorta on the run. - I left the fucker yesterday. - ( horns honking ) I work downtown. I've got my regulars there. There's at the Just the Chicken takeout. Yeah, us working gals call it the "cluck and fuck." There, the cars, they line up for me, man. - ( horn honking ) - I'll go back there as soon as it cools down. Chicken's not bad there either. Well, it's a little on the greasy side, I guess, but if you're hungry. ( scoffs ) Let's face it. Nobody's there for the chicken. ( horn honking ) ( tires screech ) Come on, baby. Come on. Come on to mama. That's it. Got another sucker. ( window hums ) Hi, darling. You a cop? Man: Do I look like a cop? No. You want a date? Right now, I'm just looking. - How much for more? - 50 for starters. - What's that include? - Today we're offering straight, head, or the combo. Half and half. - Anything extra? - Is extra. Right. - How's the head tonight? - House specialty. I'll try it for 40. 45. Including tip. Get in. ( laughs ) You're pretty. What's your name? - ( music playing ) - Liz. Elizabeth. No, just Liz. So, Just Liz, you have a place? No. We can go to yours. Get a room, an alley. Whatever you want. Well, the old lady's not home, is she, Dad? Hey, forget it. I don't do incest. - I'm not his father. - Relax. He just looks old. - Fuck you, man. - But he's got a young cock. - Real small. Like a French fry. - He's bullshitting you. I got a cock the size of a Pershing missile. - Just let me out, please? - And he comes just as fast, so don't worry. How would you know? - I heard. - From who? Who do you think? That last whore we picked up back there? - I'll kill her. - Hey, I said just let me out, please! I'm gonna find that little scumbag. Hey, you're scaring her, man. I'm not scared. It's just that I don't do double. - Oh, forget this one. - Not for any price. What, you don't do white doubles? - Only single niggers? - Come on, man. - Let her out. You're wasting our fucking time. - Yeah. Fuck, no. We're just starting to have fun, aren't we? - I'll take the head now! - ( screaming ) Hey. Hey, maybe you know her. A little girl. A Puerto Rican. Come on, suck it! I said suck it! - About 5'2". Blue eye shadow. - Man, I'm trying to get off here. I'm not stopping you. I just want to talk to her. I don't want her talng while she's giving me head. ( screams ) Jesus. - ( spits ) - She's not giving you diddly, man. We're just-- forget it, okay?! - ( laughs ) - Don't flatter yourself. I wouldn't waste my come on you. Tricks. They're so predicable, you know? You get in the car and you're his. ( horn honks ) And never get in a van. I made that mistake once. ( man whistles ) Just once. It happened downtown a couple of years ago. It was before I had a pimp to take care of me. I guess my mind just wasn't on my job that night. Man: Excuse me, miss. You're a prostitute, aren't you? No. I'm a wet dream on legs. How-- how much do you cost? What are you looking for? I don't know. Something around $20. 20 bucks won't buy a porno tape. Double it and I'll give you head. I give great head. All right. All right. Get in. So you got a place or you want it here? - ( screaming ) - Yeah! Come on, man! Give her a good fucking for me! Fuck her up the ass! Yeah! Come on, man! Do it for me, man! Stick it down her fucking throat, man! Whoo! Liz: There must have been five of 'em. They started on me right away. They were like animals. Just grunting and laughing. Grunting and cussing. - Yeah, come on, man! - ( screaming continues ) Liz: Seem to go on forever. I don't know how long. When they had enough, they-- they just got rid of me. - Man: Later, bitch! - ( door shuts ) ( whimpering ) My God. Don't be afraid. Liz: Yeah, he offered me a ride to the nearest hospital. I really should've gone, but the hospital would've called the cops and I couldn't deal with the cops. So I told him I had a fight with my boyfriend and maybe he could just take me home. Then he told me he was a schoolteacher. Great, with my luck, he'll molest me. He gave me his handkerchief to wipe away the blood. The only thing he wanted was to know if I needed anything. I hated asking, but I needed some money. He gave me 20 bucks, his name, and his address. I guess he thought he'd never see it again, but I sent it back with a new handkerchief and I wrote him this little thank-you note. "Just a line to let you know that I'm okay." But he never wrote back. One look at my spelling would scare anybody off. Especially a schoolteacher, you know? ( air rhythmically rushing ) Looks a little flat. Need a hand pumping it up? You are doing it without a rubber thing? I pay for it without a rubber thing. You prefer what without a rubber thing? - Everything. - What are you, man, like suicidal? Yes. I am liking that, too. Well, I'm not into suicides and I always use a rubber thing. - I pay extra. - You couldn't afford extra. ( siren blaring ) He wants it, but he doesn't want to use a rubber. Get a lot of men like that. I mean, they'll pay extra. Sometimes even double. I mean, that is really stupid. What if they took something home to their wives? Some of 'em never give up, do they? Take Charlie for instance. Man was as good as gold. Charlie was a regular, but he didn't want sex. Well, not straight sex anyway. All I had to do was hit him with his cane and he'd come. First time, I got a little carried away. Bam. Oops. Then I found out just how hard he liked it. It's funny. The first time I saw him all stretched out on the bed with his skinny little chicken legs and his wrinkled little butt, I mean, I practically peed my pants. Just six swats. That was all he needed. Easy money. I must have a talent for it. I should open up a torture chamber. I make him beg for mercy. There was this one day, right, his grandchildren were there. He told them I was from the welfare department. That he had to show me around the house. We left the kids watching TV and we went upstairs. We couldn't do it in the bedroom 'cause the lock was broke. So we did it in the bathroom, but I couldn't get a good swing. It was just too narrow. - ( glass shatters ) - ( Liz laughs ) I broke a fucking light fixture. He was so sweet. He always gave me something. I mean, you know, besides the money. Usually something from the garden. I know it's stupid to get involved with tricks, but he's, well, he's a client. And sometimes, you've gotta break the rules. Last year, Charlie had a stroke. Give me your hands, Donatello. ♪ Your love has got a hold on me ♪ ♪ Your love's got a hold on me ♪ ♪ Your love has got a hold on me... ♪ Okay, so he's in a rest home now. Don't mean he has to rest.

Even tricks need a little bit of mystery, AIDS carrier. She's a fucking strawberry. Won't accept cash, only crack. And you see, prostitutes like that, they have no respect for themselves. I mean, I would never pull out one of my breasts in public. I would never go out with a bodysuit on. I mean, just a bodysuit. And I would never open my legs on the street. I mean, I would never do none of that shit. And I don't wear shorts, either. Well, I wear shorts, but I don't wear them up the crack of my ass, you know? And I only wear 'em during the day. I mean, when I was younger, I used to do shit like that, I guess. I don't know. Seems the older I get, the more mature I get, I guess. Goddamn motherfucking shit. - ( tires screech ) - ( horn honks ) ( tires screech ) ( music playing ) Give me a dry martini, please. Very dry with a cherry. Not an olive. ( panting ) He doesn't really think I'm gonna leave him. Hey, I know what he thinks. He thinks I'm still gonna work. Like I said, I left my place yesterday, I went and got this little motel room. And see, what he thinks is is that I've been stacking my money, right? And in a couple of days, I'm gonna have this big bankroll for him. ( scoffs ) That's what he thinks, but I'm not. No. Not this time. I've been spending my money. Oh. Look at my nails. I used to have beautiful nails. Now I can't leave them alone. I'm like a dog with a bone. See, pimps, you know, they think that they got this hold on you, you know? Like you'll stick to them like fucking crazy glue. And it is kinda crazy, you know? In some sort of sick, twisted way, they... they make you believe that you love 'em. I knew Blake about a year and he never asked me out or even laid a hand on me. It wasn't that I wanted him to. It was that I wondered why he hadn't. So naturally, when he sent me a classy dress and showed up at my place in a tux with pine freshener on his breath, I wondered what the fuck was up. Um, hey. Do you think we could sit at a different table? I mean, I got this problem with kitchens. I used to work at this greasy spoon, you know, and it was just crawling with roaches. Ahem. Well, it's your night. I understand, ma'am. Please, follow me. Oh, but I didn't mean your kitchen was crawling with roaches, too. It's just that I get this, what do you call it? A phobia about it. Yeah, that's it. Liz: I felt kinda nervous. You know, like you do when you're out with your boss or something. I didn't think I could be promoted and I wondered if a whore could be fired. But then he never would've used breath freshener and bought me that classy new dress, would he? So now you gonna tell me what the occasion is? So what do you want to eat? ( sighs ) A steak. I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse. 10-1 it is one, huh? Steak "tarter." Yeah, this is a nice place, but you'd think they'd know how to spell steak, huh? - S-T-E-K-E-- - This is a French restaurant. Then how come there's no French fries on the menu, huh? They call 'em pommes frites. Oh. Well, I'll have a helping of that and a nice, juicy steak. Steak tartare is raw steak minced with raw onions, eggs, and Worcestershire sauce. Oh. Really? Well, why don't you make a suggestion, then, huh? All right. As a starter, how 'bout gravlax marinade? What's that? It's raw salmon and it's marinade-- Raw? Is everything in this restaurant raw? I mean, can't they afford a chef around here? Hey, raw food is really good for you. Don't you know nothin'? ( speaks French ) He wants you to choose. ( laughs ) What, you found something? What's so funny about crab julienne? You remember. Your old whore Julienne. She had crabs like you wouldn't believe. - You remember. - Uh, yes, madam? - I don't really know, sir. - Hey, call him waiter. You call me sir. I'll order for both of us. Très bien, sir. We'll have the calamar a la chinoise. And would sir care for some wine? Hey, can we get some champagne? I haven't had champagne for a long time. Give me a bottle of "Low Da Vici." Very cold. I presume sir means "Eau De Vichy." Yeah, that's what I said. So now you gonna tell me what this is all about? Madam has a request? I have an extensive repertoire. Uh, how 'bout "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"? I'm afraid I'm not that familiar with the contemporary classics. - Of course not. - How 'bout the march from act three of Wagner's "Lohengrin"? I think you mean act two. I was wondering when we were gonna get together, - but is this like a proposal or something? - "Something," my ass. Don't say you didn't remember our anniversary. I've been looking after you a year now. A year this very day. - C'est bon, sir? - You may pour. - To our anniversary. - And the oldest profession. - The what? - Ahem. Uh, prostitution is commonly known as the oldest profession. It sure makes me feel old. I'll drink to that. This tastes exactly like water. It's sparkling mineral water. It's good for the liver. You oughta lay off the booze. It's got a lot of calories. - No, put it out. - Hmm? We're in a nonsmoking area. Put it out. Well, why don't we move to a smoking area, then? You wanna take care of yourself? Smoking is bad for your health. So is fucking scabby tricks. And what is this? It's calamari and lychees. What's it look like? I don't know, but I've seen one before, I think. What is calamar? It's a kind of octopus, you stupid moron. It's fucking octopus. Ha! I should've known. They got testicles, don't they? Though I thought they had eight of 'em. Looks like you've been shortchanged. Looks like a dick. ( spits ) Tastes like a dick. Look, all I want is just an old-fashioned piece of apple pie with loads of ice cream on it! - Yeah, well, forget it! - What-- what you say?! What, have you gone deaf? I said forget it! You're as fat as a fucking pig! ( scoffs ) I'm-- I am? Liz: I guess he was right. I smoke too much, eat junk food, and drink like a fish. I mean, I gotta get some satisfaction out of life or it just ain't worth living. Whoring ain't exactly the job of the future, you know. And working out, doing 50 sit-ups when I could have been sleeping wasn't my idea of fun. Well, it had its moments, I guess. ♪ Tell me ♪ ♪ Tell me all your secrets ♪ ♪ Tell me all your secrets ♪ ♪ Tell me. ♪ - ( buzzing ) - ( Liz groaning ) Our first year together as pimp and whore and Blake's idea of an anniversary gift... You're gonna see a big change in yourself. Psychologically. Physically, you're gonna be a lot more body conscious. Great. Does that mean I'm gonna lose my stomach? Tattoo artist: You'll be a lot more committed to self. And to the one you love, you'll have a special, spiritual connection because tattoos are forever. So are diamonds, but they're a lot less painful. That's the most pricks I've had in 30 minutes. Liz: For a while, he was right. I felt kinda special. Till one by one I found out all of Blake's girls had one. Hey, not always on the same body part. I wasn't special. I was just a piece of branded cattle. One of the herd. You see, what pimps do is they build you up and then they break you down. It's kinda like being a hostage. They just know how to make you need 'em. They don't love you. Pimps don't love nobody. Give me another martini, please. Air dry. Getting as bad as Bill was. Fuck it. The minute I laid eyes on him, I thought he was real cute. It was back home at the local dive where they had music and beer and you could hang out and shoot pool. Like I did with my friend Martha. It was back in the days when I was living the straight life. - I feel like I'm gonna die. - Put your bet on him. - Think I should? - What's a buck? Yeah, you're right. But don't you think it will look kinda weird, me going over there and putting money down right in front of him? No, he'll just think you're some horny bar slut - that wants to fuck him. - Stop. What if I want to marry him? Then I think I better bet on him. All: 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! ( cheering ) ♪ A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do... ♪ Oh, fuck it. He wasn't my type anyway. ♪ A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do ♪ ♪ And this girl is gonna go home... ♪ I didn't like men much anyway. Thanks for believing in me. This is for you. - Congratulations. - Oh, it was nothing. - No, it was, really. - You think so? Yeah. Hey, you shouldn't put your talents down, you know? It's an inherited talent. My old man's a big drinker. - Really? So is mine. - No kidding? Yeah, well, that's what my mom told me anyway. You wanna dance or something? - Okay. - All right. Here, you can have this prize. Oh, gee, thanks. Liz: For a while, it was great. We really loved each other. The way when you're a little girl and imagine how love would feel. The way your mom always told you love should be. So I thought getting married was the best thing that ever happened to me. I guess it was too good to last. Well, that was one thing my mom didn't tell me. ♪ I want to bang her, I want to bang her ♪ - ♪ Knock boots ♪ - ♪ I want to bang her ♪ - ♪ I want to bang her... ♪ - Oh, shit! Liz: Well, I guess playing house is sorta fun when you're seven years old. But when you're seven months pregnant, well, forget it. I mean, when he starts getting home later and later, drunker and drunker 'cause of all the overtime he's putting in, when you know he's been fired and he's been cheating on you. Well, that'd be tough on any relationship. Still, I couldn't stop loving the bastard. So I kept on trying to please him. Getting all dolled up for dinner and setting the table pretty and making his favorite salad. All I really wanted was a good night's sleep. And you never knew how he was gonna react. It was like living on the edge of a fucking volcano. ( crying ) ( baby crying ) Shut up. Chrissy. Shh. Come on, baby. We're gonna go see Grandma. Let's get out of this dump. Woman on TV: I want my daughter. I'm not an alcoholic. Give me Karen. Man on TV: Take it off, then. Woman: Give me my daughter, please. Man: Yeah, this is what you want. - No. - This is what it's about, huh, Bambi? I want my daughter. Liz: Finally, I get it through my head. Okay, I married a loser. No great loss. A lot of people do it. So I leave Bill and I move in with my mom. Then I get this dream job at a sleazy diner. One night it was late, I was tired, and the tips were shit. I just worked a double shift when this guy walks in. It was like he walked into the wrong restaurant. What's on the menu tonight? Chef Pierre is gone and we're closing in five minutes. I can offer you a piece of cantaloupe, though. - How's your cantaloupe? - Ripe. Is that what you wanted? - How 'bout a drink instead? - Sorry, we don't serve-- What do you say I take you somewhere that does? What, me? You mean... I'm not much of a drinker. In fact, I'm not a big drinker at all. Sorry. Keep the change. - Thanks. - I'm a big tipper. I have to go home. I got a-- You have a what? A cat. I have a cat I got to feed, but... But I think I might have already fed him. ( laughs ) Liz: I would have gone out with him anyway. It was more money than I made in a whole week. I thought, "Who cares? What do I have to lose?" I'll just lock up. It'll only be a minute. Liz: Doing it for money-- it's like losing your virginity.

But I'm not afraid of dying. I mean, even if there's nothing. No heaven, I mean. Even if heaven ain't like they say it is. All saints and angels. I mean, even if it's just peace and quiet. I could sure use some of that. Hell couldn't be any worse than this now, could it? The big tease. They love it and they think you love it, too. They wanna hear all about it. ( lowered ) "Talk to me," they'd say. I know what they mean now, but at first I didn't. "What do you want me to talk about," I'd say. ( lowered ) "What do you like doing?" I don't know. I like watching TV. ( lowered ) "No, not that. What am I doing to you?" "What you doing to me?" ( lowered ) "Yeah. Tell me, tell me. What am I doing to you?" I was still young. I didn't know what they wanted me to say. Now when they ask, I know what they want. As soon as they get their dick out and ask me if I like it. I whisper to them, "Oh, honey, it's a beautiful cock. It's so big and hard." ( lowered ) "What do you want me to do with it," they'd say. I'd love to really tell 'em. But instead, I say, "Oh, my pussy's really hungry for your big, hard cock. Come on, give it to me. Give it to me." Yeah. But then there are those who want to do the talking themselves. I mean, talk dirty. Sometimes it feels like they just-- they just want to rip you open. Hey, be a little gentle, huh? Shut your fucking trap. Liz: So I just shut up and let 'em do their thing. I close my eyes. I don't want to see the hate in their faces. They must have terrible lives. The men, I mean. Something must have happened to 'em to make 'em like that. They weren't born that way, were they? Maybe they're henpecked at home. Or bossed around at work so they feel humiliated. They want to humiliate somebody back. Makes 'em feel better. More important. It's nothing personal. I know that. They don't even want sex, you know. It's more like... like revenge. Yeah. That's it. They only want revenge. ( water running ) ( man moaning ) I feel sorry for their wives. Most of the men who come in here must be married. And they come here because we'll do the things their wives and girlfriends won't do. Head. That's what most of 'em ask for. I mean, I don't see why a woman would have a problem with sticking her man's cock in her mouth? I mean, I guarantee you if he ain't sticking it in her mouth, he'll be sticking it in somebody else's. Could be hers, could be mine. We're substitutes. I bet you he's got his eyes shut thinking of his wife right now. ( moaning continues ) Me? I don't wanna see another dick as long as I live. Ugh. ( sighs ) I've lost count of how many I've had. Must be miles. ( moaning continues ) I used to love sex. I used to love everything about it. Now when I go to bed, all I want to do is go to sleep. And I bet you I've had more sex in places like this than I've ever had in a bed. I should write a book about it-- "The Toilets I Have Known." I met my best friend in one. Well, she was. I was working downtown. Hanging around looking for tricks when this girl comes along acting like she's stoned or drunk or something. And then I see the blood and I just look at her and I say, "What the fuck?" And she just says, "Blake." And I see the bastard had cut her right across the stomach. And then I thought, "If I don't do something fast, she's gonna bleed to death." So I go rushing her into the theater and I yell to the chick in the box, "Get an ambulance." I guess she must have just got the manager 'cause after a while, this bitch comes busting in and starts laying into us. Calling us dirty, filthy sluts. And I'm trying to stop the blood, but it just won't fucking stop. And the poor girl, she's starting to go into shock and the manager's yelling at us about AIDS and trying to kick us out. Without getting too close, of course. But the blood just kept coming. And then in comes Katie. She sorta took control right away, you know. I mean, even got the manager to help out. She told her to imagine it was her daughter. If it wasn't for Katie, I don't think the girl would've pulled through. Katie wanted to know why she didn't go to the cops. I laughed. I told her Blake pays the cops to look the other way. Anyway, he got her a few weeks later, but this time, the knife went straight through. That was a terrible week. I don't know what the hell I would've done without Katie. She looked after me like a sister would. If I would've had one. Sometimes I wonder why my parents ever had me. They must've been drunk. I guess I was why Dad left home. Katie was the only person I ever knew that never wanted. I wanted. I needed. There were nights I needed so badly just to be held. For my birthday, Katie bought me a book. Nobody ever gave me a book before. It's called "Animal Farm" and I'm telling you, it's just like life. It's about animals, but it's not for kids. It's the best book I ever read. Well, it's the only book I ever read. And on the inside cover she wrote, "To Liz with love and all beautiful things. K." Sometimes I used to open it just to read that. I just loved being with her. She even turned me on to serious music for a while. ( music playing ) She was so smart. She could make almost anything sound interesting. Katie worked as a bartender. She made good money, but what a waste. I mean, she went to junior college. I kept telling her she should get a good job like a teacher or something. She'd make a great teacher. God, I wish I had her brains. And I told her that. She said there's nothing wrong with my brain, only my education. My education? That can't be right 'cause I hardly finished school. I mean, I haven't been in school for so long that I can't even remember anything. ( man moaning ) That was the end of Katie and me. ( woman smacking lips ) Sharp as a razor. And I'd use it, too. Once I'd use it on myself. But now I'd fight back. That's Katie. ( man moaning louder ) Huh. Dignity. ( bicycle horn honks ) Oh, it's you. You suddenly takin' a liking to rubbers? I thought you might have taken a disliking to them. - Not on your life. - But I'm exceedingly clean. I'm sure you are. But look, it's no use sitting there because I'm not gonna change my mind. I don't care how much you pay me. And I'm not gonna do any business with you sitting here either, so why don't you just fuck off? And take your little horn with you. ( horn honks ) Why do you insist upon a rubber? Crabs, clap, syphilis, herpes, AIDS, chlamydia. Is that enough for you or do you want more? I mean, with all that, what could you possibly have against a rubber, huh? It's not that I have anything against them. It's just that they are usually too small for me. You gotta be kidding. No. I am not. I have a very stout member. ( laughs ) Well, that's the best news I've heard all day. I'm thrilled for you. Congratulations. Thank you. But the pleasure is yours. Oh, Jesus. You guys still believe that shit, don't you? "In a recent nationwide survey, eight out of 10 prostitutes who expressed preference said that their vagina preferred small 'members.'" It sounds like it turns you on, but it does nothing for me. Comprende? It's the cops. I suggest you get the hell outta here. You go down the street and then you hang a left. You go onto the freeway there and it's right there on your right. You can't miss it. The gas station is open all night. Uh-huh. Thank you. You are most kind. You're welcome. Come here, sweetheart. Now then, you have two choices, honey. You can haul ass yourself or we haul you off and take you in. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Really, sir. were you gonna have me jog alongside of you or were you gonna cuff me to your spoke? ( laughs ) Shit. Cops. Now there's a confused bunch for ya. They don't know what they want, so they're always giving you a choice. Like this last time. This vice cop, he says to me, "Give me head or you're going to jail." So I give him head. And then the fucker busts me for jaywalking. I didn't use the crosswalk on the way to his dick. Well, excuse me, Officer, but if your dick had been long enough, I wouldn't have had to cross the fucking street. I wish the beach boys had busted me. I could use a night in jail. Just for the rest, you know? Hey. ( gasps ) Missed you, baby. So how much did we do tonight? It's-- it's been slow, man. Oh, yeah? So what have you done? Hey, I told you. It's been slow. So you've probably done, what, four 30s. You might have caught a 50 or two? What is that? - Four 30s, we're talking 120. - Just forget about it. Wait a minute. What did I say? You said four 30s, but-- Four 30s and two 50s. Well, it's been slow, right? Yeah. So let's say you only did one 50. You might have gotten bored and did a quick 20. Hey, wait a minute. What the fuck am I thinking? I forgot about yesterday. ( gasps ) You took off yesterday. So, uh, what have you been doing since yesterday? What are you doing around here? Welfare work? You've been with that bookworm again, hmm? - That dyke Katie. - No. No, no. I-- I told you once before, reading is bad for your eyes. Hey, man, I swear. I haven't seen Katie. I got this trick and he took me down here to this motel - and it was an all-nighter. - Yeah. I just slept in. I couldn't help it, man. - You should've made plenty, right? - He robbed me! - Bullshit! - I told you, it's been slow. - Man: Me spare some change? - Don't give me that slow shit. - You stink of booze. - I'm telling you the truth. - How 'bout a dollar, then, mon? - Get the fuck outta here! Where is it? Where's the rest of it?! Here, mon. Take the dollar! Leave the woman alone! - Buzz off! - Hey! Liz: Take your foot off of him! You're hurting him! - Listen to the woman. - Leave him alone! ( gasps ) I don't got any more. I swear on my mother. Well, your mother's dead. So you better swear on somebody else, but dust don't count in my book. I'm gonna be back in an hour. You better have done four by then. I don't care what you have to do to catch cock. Lie in the street with your fucking legs in the air. Just do it. Was that third finger left hand or third finger right? Take your pick! I got it. Who the fuck does she think she is? You only need one like that. One bad apple and all the others rot. And if she thinks that she can dump me like I was one of her fucking tricks, well, she's got a big surprise coming. Protection. He is my protection. I mean, we can't even carry a knife anymore. You get caught, they bust you on a concealed weapons charge. You work on your back, you gotta have a middleman. Or you could end up on your back in the morgue. I got somebody that will fix her up. And he'll fix her for good. They'll never recognize her. Even if they do, who cares? She's a whore. Hey, it was a trick, wasn't it? I mean, there are a lot of freaky tricks around, you know? Sometimes tricks, they-- they freak out. What can you do? There's this one, right, he was young, but he was small. He was vicious and starts sticking it in me right away. All of a sudden, he starts kissing me. Man, I never kiss nobody. You never do. I mean, I'll suck their cock, they can lick me, they can fuck me, but no kissing. And no fingers neither. I mean, you should see their nails. I mean, who knows where their fingers have been? No sucking my breasts neither. So anyway, this guy, he starts trying to kiss me. So I said to him, "Hey, man, I don't kiss." He didn't seem to mind. All of a sudden he says to me, ( lowered ) "Is it nice?" I said to him, "Is what nice?" ( lowered ) He says, "This," and pushes it in even harder. Now I know he wanted me to talk dirty, right? I was still pretty new to the game. I didn't understand. So I said, "It's all right, I guess." ( lowered ) "All right? All right?" he says. "Is that all?" And then he pulls out. So I asked him why he pulled out. And he says, ( lowered ) "Because you're not enjoying it." I said, "Hey, I don't have to enjoy it. You paid for it. You enjoy it." And he goes, ( lowered ) "But I can't enjoy it if I know you're only doing it because I paid you." Well, if you want passion, that costs extra. By then his time was up, so I asked him if he was finished. ( lowered ) "Finished?" he says. "I haven't even started yet. Kiss me." So he yanks my head and he starts trying to kiss me. And I'm trying to push him away and then he starts shouting to me, ( lowered ) "You fucking cunts! You're all the same! You're dead, all of ya! No feelings!" And then he starts trying to kiss me again. Then he asks for his money back. I said, "Sorry. No deposit, no return." Then I tried to get up and get out. Suddenly, he grabs my bag with one and my hair with the other and he starts banging my head against the floor. I mean, I thought my fucking brain was gonna explode. I'm telling you, he must have slammed my head about six times before that damn door finally opened. You oughta be more careful with who you date. That's when I realized, you can't work without a pimp. So I became one of Blake's girls. Well, it seems to me like this pimp set you up, mon. Yeah. I thought of that, too. And one day I put it to him point-blank. And point-blank he denied it. Practically knocked my goddamn teeth down my throat. Me and my girls. I look after 'em. I'm out all hours keeping an eye out on 'em just to make sure they're safe. I drive around just checking. I know all the places that they go with their dates. Sometimes I follow 'em. You see, we're like business partners. They fuck and I manage. Tell me something. How much does he make off you? What's his profit margin? What's that got to do with it? Have some herb. If I'm not paying for their rent, I'm paying for their goddamn fines. ( sniffs ) I pay for their clothes, their checkups. I pay for their rubbers. ( sniffs ) Even at wholesale, they're still expensive. Or as I tell you, they don't come cheap. ( sniffs ) So how much you say he takes? 100%. Mon, it's like you're getting screwed twice. Hmm. Look, it's just like I was managing a factory. This, it just happens to be a pussy factory. This is exactly why I'm trying to get away from him. Even factories treat their employees better. At least they get benefits. Mm. But it's still a factory with employees and somebody like me running things. I got what they call "entrepreneurial flair." I can see a need and I fill a demand. The man is a slave driver. Holy shit. Just look at that one. Dumb kid. ( horn honks ) ( horn honks ) She supposed to be selling sex. It looks like she's waiting for the goddamn bus. Okay, so it's hot, your shoes hurt, and she had an abortion last week. Guess who picked up the tab on that one. Everybody starts off by thinking they're gonna make a lot of money and get out of it in a couple of years. But it never happens. You just stay doing it. I've seen some pretty kids with faces like dogs after only six months. You know, they say you can tell a woman that's been doing this. That it shows in her face. I mean, look at mine. Does it show? In my eyes? That's where it starts, they say. In the eyes and then in the mouth. All hard. They're wrong. Yeah. They're full of shit. You better believe they're full of shit. Yeah. They're full of shit. You know why? Because it starts in here. It's like a cancer and then it just starts eating away at you until there's nothing left. Just an empty shell. They're oversexed and they're born like that. Nature's rejects from the moment that they came into this world. All they have to offer is their bodies, so they might as well get paid for it. They're born with a price tag. If somebody gave 'em a million bucks, they'd be back on the streets in a week. They can't help themselves. There's nothing you can do about it. It's like being born black or white. It's just the way they are. I must be some use to somebody. I mean, there must be a reason for me. Right? You know, years ago, when I first got started, before I got things straightened out around here, I was always getting busted for pandering, pimping. Do you think what I do is wrong? I think what a pimp does is wrong. I think it's the law that's wrong. Katie called him a parasite. Parasite. Parasite. I like that word. Parasite. Look, if it was illegal to live off the earnings of others, then the stock exchange would be shut down tomorrow. And all the employment agencies would be charged with pimping. I'm like an employment agency myself, only I'm not legal. And I don't want to be illegal. You know, you should be legal. Then there wouldn't be a need for him. You make it legal and I'll open an office. Until then, this is my office. Some of our regulars, they phone me. And they tell me what they want and I deliver. Maybe I'm nothing more than takeout food. Easy, quick, and affordable. I'm sort of a dial-a-ride service. And I'm real charitable, too. I always make sure I give a little back. I even make regular donations to the policemen's pension fund. ( laughs ) Do you think for some men, even a few, that I'm a cure for loneliness? Maybe a short-term cure. The more I think about it, the more I'd really like to change my life. If only I could find a decent man. Or even a man that just wanted a... what you call it? You know, they got a wife and then they got a... a mistress. Yeah, that's it. I'd really love that. Where in the hell am I gonna find that? ( horn honks ) Hey, you wanna move in? Can you afford the down payment? Who knows? Come here. What sign are you? - What sign am I? - Quickly. I'm a stop sign. Ow! You're a Scorpio. - You're a Scorpio, aren't you? - Yeah, I'm a Scorpio. - Hey, how'd you know? - Shit. I need a Virgo. Do you know where I can find one? - I'll be a Virgo for 40. - No, no. I need a real one. And my cards say I can only pay 10. - ( sighs ) - You have the most beautiful eyes. I'll catch you in another lifetime. Bye. What a weirdo. I wonder what he was into. Eh, I don't mind something different once in a while, but I don't do nothing dirty. You know? I mean, I don't take golden showers and I don't give golden showers. But... well, there was this one guy, right, he used to like watching me take a dump, okay? I mean, he used a flashlight. Trouble is, he always seemed to show up after I'd already had one. I haven't seen him around in a while. Guess he found someone more regular. Yeah, but I got this other trick, he's an older guy, you know. Real soft-spoken. I swear, he could be a judge or doctor or something. And we have a regular date every Thursday at 3:00. And he always pays me with brand-new money. Get the money first. That's my motto. But before I could get my pants down, he's shaking his head. So I offer him a tit job. Strike two. When I realized he didn't want straight sex, I thought, "Hello, another nut." And I let him know I didn't do nothing dirty. I don't do anything dirty. Then he just nods and points to my shoe. For a minute, I thought he was gonna fuck me with it. I mean, you wouldn't believe some of the things they've tried to stick up me. Then he gives me this piece of paper and tells me not to read it until he says so. Finally, he gets his dick out, right? What do you want me to do? Read me the note. About now, he's starting to get a hard on. Liz: "You naughty boy, Johnny. You dirty little boy. Mommy's very, very angry with you"? ( groaning ) Louder. Liz: And before you know it, he's beating his meat and licking my shoe. "You naughty boy, Johnny. You dirty little boy. Mommy's very, very angry with you. You naughty boy, Johnny! You dirty little boy! Mommy's very, very angry with you! You naughty boy, Johnny! You dirty little boy! Mommy's very, very, very, very angry with you"! ( groaning continues ) Keep it up. ( yawns ) "You naughty boy, Johnny. You dirty little boy, Johnny. Mommy's very, very angry with you." ( laughing ) Liz: Different strokes for different folks. Who can figure it? But that's how Johnny came. Yeah, I know my lines now, but he's always quick. That's what you want, quick. I mean, some of 'em take forever. The nervous ones, they can be a real bitch. Sometimes they never get a hard-on at all. They're too embarrassed to ask for their money back. Hey, they wouldn't get it back anyway. I mean, if you go to a restaurant and you order a meal and you suddenly lose your appetite, it's not my fault, is it? The best guys are the ones in the lunch hour. They're always in a rush. Or the older guys. They're good, too. I mean, sometimes I'm putting the rubber on and then all of a sudden, oops. It's all over. "Oh, honey. I needed that," I'd say to them and finish them off with my hand and pretend to be real disappointed and stuff. You know, so they don't feel cheated. ( sighs ) But you know who the worst ones are? The young ones. I mean, they're always laying these head trips on you. Like, ( whiny ) "Usually I don't have to pay for it." I mean, I don't want to hear that. I don't got time for that shit. And then they start holding out on you like they're doing you some big favor or something. Thanks, but no, thanks. I mean, for them, I need a meter like a taxi. No, I like the ones that just want to hurry up, - get it over with, and go home. - ( clapping ) Yeah, I'm going home. ( playing harmonica ) That's Chris. Handsome, isn't he? He's so smart. He's six now. Yeah, he's at that age where-- well, you know, he's grown up and... well, if he was living with me, how would I explain it? I mean, I work at night, so you could say I got a night job. But then when I go to jail and I don't come home during the day, I mean, how do I explain that? Everybody says he's smart. You should hear him read. He knows all the animals. I taught him that. He loves animals. He sent me this painting of his cat. "This is Mandy," he wrote on the back. "She sleeps in the washing machine." He's with a nice couple. They don't have any kids of their own. He was sort of adopted. After my mom died... the courts said I was an unfit mother. Yeah, that's when I moved on. Chris seems happy enough, though. I wish he was with me, but I can see him whenever I want to. But I have to call first, but... uh, I don't go back there too much. It kinda upsets me. Last time I went back there, I didn't tell him I was coming. I stood outside his school and waited for the class to end. He was wearing the jeans I'd sent him for his birthday. They're probably still a little too big for him, but he'll grow into them. His foster mother Rachel, she was there waiting to take him home. I could hardly stand to see him go, but I don't think I'll go back there again, you know. No, not for a while anyway. I don't want Chris growing up hating me. I don't want him to be ashamed of his mother. I know he calls Rachel mom, but he knows who his real mother is. What I wouldn't give for a nice, cool shower. No, Chris is better off where he is. For now, I know that. He looks just like his father. We're still married. Chances are we'd still be together if he hadn't cheated on me. I never cheated on him. Hey, what I do isn't exactly making love, is it? Hate would be closer to the truth. I mean, it isn't even sex because sex has some feelings. I mean, if you like somebody, that's sex. Well, I don't like any of these shits. No, there must be a better word for what I do. But I don't know what it is. It's mechanical. No feelings. No. I mean, maybe if you really psyched yourself up for it, you could feel something. Who wants to go through all that? I mean, when I was younger, I used to make believe somebody out here was loving me. But then I got to the point where I just hated tricks. I hate 'em. And they don't like us, neither. I mean, really like us. Oh, they want us, all right. I didn't say that. But like us? No. No way. And you never know who you're with. A total stranger or your own father. You just don't know. I mean, they're like Jekyll and Hyde. You gotta watch 'em 'cause they're always up to something. ( bicycle horn honks ) 20 bucks, sweetie. 20 bucks. - Okay? - Yeah, try her. She'll probably do it for a food stamp, asshole. I'm ready. You're cute. ( laughs ) Poor old whore. That could be me someday. Nah. I'd kill myself first. ( gasps ) ( horn honks ) In your professional opinion... what do you think my chances are? I'd say your chances are 50/50. And for 50, I'm willing to take the gamble. Let's go.
