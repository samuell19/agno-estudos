You Tube - Video Running Time 02:23:11 You Tube search name - Amar Even if someone wants you to suffer... it's God who will make happen, what He wants. This is the temple of justice The house of God This is the temple of justice and the house of God Express your wishes, don't be afraid You're a sinner. That's why you don't approach Him Good morning. Get up, Your Highness! You've been sitting like this for twenty-one days. Welcome, Prince. You are so good looking. As if God has created you with His own hands. Fool! What a beautiful life you had. Now you've come here. Have you brought a message for me? I don't follow a word of what you are saying. As if you've followed! Maybe you have. You are right, Sir. Move! Are you going to drink up all the milk? See mother, he'll get me beaten up today, too. See, now he's sulking. What was it I said? I know she's your mother. But what can I do? Milk brings us money. Do you have any? I swear that I don't. Do you know I committed a sin yesterday because of you? I mixed two full tumblers of water in the milk. Don't tell anyone. Even then mother couldn't earn two rupees and fifteen annas... and, as usual, I was beaten. You won't understand my problems. You don't have a stepmother. Sonia, can't you hear? I'll beat you black and blue. Look father, she's beating me even in her sleep. Yes, that is why she's called a stepmother. Try as much as you can, she won't get up. Then see a new trick today, father. First go and finish your kitchen chores. Don't you see all the pots filled up? What are you doing? She'll kill you. She'll put her stamp on this colorful cover. You'll get us killed today. Help! Help! The skies are cloudy, my heart full of joy The peacock is dancing and singing The spring has come A couple of birds are above, in the sky The butterfly is playing with the flowers They have brought a message of love for me Let me go. You won't dance at the fair this time. - I will. Who are you to stop me? - I'll cut you into pieces. Like hell! Go stop your mother and sister. - They are both dead. - Why didn't you die too? Then you'll remain unmarried. Have you seen your face in the water? What are you doing in the jungle so early in the morning, Amarnath? - Looking for a legal remedy? - Ask me. I'm a more experienced lawyer than you. So what if I haven't passed law? I have more experience. What happened to the finger? - I'm thinking of getting married. - By all means... right now. You are at a dangerous age. You'll escape all legal problems. - Thank you. - For my legal advise... send six rupees, six annas and six paise to my house. The advocate is here. What happened to your finger? - I got a little hurt. - Hurt? Mr. Zulfikar has signed and sent over his power of attorney. Ramu's case is coming up for hearing at eleven today. And Mr. Beharilal wants to discuss some point on his criminal case. Tell him he can't buy justice with his wealth. If he agrees with my advice, tell him to see me tomorrow. I want to see Mr. Sampat's report on Mr. Zulfikar's case. Tell Durga's widow I'll fight her case. - She need not worry about my fees. - I'll take care of it. We have to file the O.S. 153 EPl today in the office. I think you should get a penicillin shot. We have to file that EPl today for sure. Consider it done. You've won the case, Mr. Sharma. So why have you come? We have brought some sweets because of that. What happened to your finger? A crow has taken it away. Have the sweets distributed among the kids in the area. - Yes Sir. - And listen... go to the court at eleven and get a date for Mr. Verma's case. It's a small matter. The judge should not mind. These small injuries become infected and serious. You've made a big mistake in your life. - What? - You should have been a pharmacist. Yes. Everyone makes mistakes. But do get a penicillin injection. O.S. 153 EPl must be filed today. You will remember? - Greetings. - Greetings. What have you decided? I cannot admit my guilt. If I'm convicted, my family's reputation will be ruined. Your family's reputation was ruined the day you committed the crime. But I can be saved. There is no witness or evidence to my crime. A crime leaves clues all the time. Listen to my advice. There is only one way out for you. Accept your crime and suffer the consequences. See what he decides. - Good day, sir. - What can I do for you, sir? I came to ask... What happened to your finger? A dog bit my finger. It must have been that milkmaid Sonia's dog. Take good care. He's poisonous. - You are no less. - No I'm not, but I've lost in love. The villagers have erected the tent for the fair on my land. When I went to remove the tent, a few heads got smashed. - It's become a police case. - It's good. After you've eaten prison food for a few days... perhaps you'll come to your senses. - What had to happen... - You've become too hot headed. Just because you have some money, doesn't mean that you... can deny the villagers their simple pleasures. Go. I can do nothing for you. Save me just this once. In the future, I'll be more careful when dealing in matters of the heart. - Who is it? - It's me, Sir. You follow me as if you were my wife. You've taken the words out of my mouth. There's a letter from your father, along with a photo. - Whose photo? - His would-be daughter-in-law! What will my father's daughter-in-law be to me? - Your wife-to-be. - Wife? Then what are you staring at! Go away. Stop this dancing. You've been at it for an hour and a half. Can't you see the girl is almost fainting? Come and have some breakfast. I feel frustrated because of such talk. You want one to wear shoes, but not walk on the ground. This is not some pudding which you can eat at leisure. You have to sweat for this. This is art. Don't argue so early in the morning. Else I'll break your head with your own art. You won't see me set foot in this house again. Don't carry the musical instrument in your anger. Father, you're insulting the teacher. If you're so disturbed, then why have me learn dancing? I don't want to, but those big shots who come for your... marriage want to know. "Is the girl a post graduate? Does she have thirty-two teeth?' 'Hope the girl's not dark." Idiot! Can't you see the milk has turned cold. You want to kill my child with cold milk? No fool wants to know if you know sewing... or cooking or looking after the house. The great musicians want to know if you can dance... sing or shake about! I'm not a musician's son. My father used to make patties in Hapur. You've come again? Just yesterday you attacked this. Yesterday was Monday. I was invited by Mr. Amar. On Sunday I was invited by Sonia. Then on Saturday at the temple. On Friday at the orphanage. Thursday at the Charitable hospital. Today it's your turn. My month's schedule is set. - See for yourself. - Why don't you marry? Like a washerman's dog, you have no place neither at the... washerman's home, nor anywhere else. You scrounge all over! A soothsayer said I'll have seventeen children... - which would finish me. - Did your father have a single child? He had one. Where have all these people come from? - Get rid of them or I will faint. - I have brought them with me, Sir. Who called you? What are you looking at? Throw them all out. - Just listen to me. - What's going on father? - Ask me, Miss Anju. - Let him go. You give justice. Like every year there was to be a fair at the temple. The villagers had collected two piase from everyone and erected a tent. But Sankat and his men tore up the tent. - He says there will be no fair. - Who is he to stop the fair? The fair will surely take place. Come and have your milk. It's getting cold. - Throw them all out! - Why are you turning them out? Come and join me for breakfast, all of you. Please come with me. Get sweets and fruit for everyone. Please sit down. From today, the doors of this house are closed to you forever. Eat what you want for the last time. Go! Where are you going? The carrot pudding is ready. Please taste it. You must. Thank you. Do you know how will you repent one day? When these same bulls will attack you! You will regret it one day. Distribute it to all. Come on, eat. Sit and drink. Brothers and sisters, don't be shy. Eat, drink and be merry. Forget Sankat and his problem. Celebrate your fair, right here. You can't have a bigger one than this. Three cheers for Anju Devi. You claim to be a big lawyer. Why didn't you get Sankat arrested? If he is produced in court, I swear I'll finish him. The problem is he talks only with his knife, not his tongue. All of you sit, and you come with me. - Do you know where Sankat lives? - Yes I do. - Sankat's house? No I don't. - You are scared again! What? Me being scared? There's nothing to be afraid of. But it will be better to get police protection. Why do I need the police, when you are with me? Turn the car around, the lion is sitting. - Where? - There, in front. - Go and call him. - Me? Blow the horn. Again you're scared? Go. Brother Sankat, I'm in a fix. What are you doing? I'll forget the dialog. The landlord's daughter is very innocent. She's just out of college and doesn't know you. The villagers went to the landlord complaining about you. I reasoned that whatever brother Sankat is doing is correct. But she's stubborn and came here. You deal with her. I had nothing to do with this. I'm going. Let's go to the police station. He's in a nasty mood. The villagers say you had the tent removed. They are right. Where will the poor things have their fair? There won't be a fair. Why not? Is it your decision to make? - The land is mine. - But you're defying the law. I, too, have a big lawyer, Mr. Amarnath. Why escalate the matter, brother Sankat? I have no sister. I am an only child. Try and stop me then. Are you the lawyer, Mr. Amarnath? Why do you doubt it? Because you seem to be a good person by face. I'm not a bad person by nature either. Then why are you defending a bad person like Sankat? Do you have an objection? It would be against justice and fair play. What if I agree with you? - Then you'll be doing me a favor. - What if I don't agree? Then you'll have to face humiliation. People will know that you can be bought. I have been given a big account. Now I'll refuse to deal even for a treasure. Your elders provided you education for this? Strange. I'm abiding by their wishes. I thought you'd have some sense of truth and self respect. But now I know that all the injustice in this world is... because of people like you. Theft, dacoity and crimes are because of you people. Yes, I'm to blame for all the ills of the world. I'm glad you are truthful. The truth is, I have never seen such lovely anger. The features are quite good. And the poetry of India is contained within your hair. What are you saying? I was saying, drop Sankat's case, I'll give up my practice. Take me to Benaras with you. I'll bathe in the Ganges and think about you all the time. Don't you know how to behave, or are you misbehaving on purpose? I'm seeing myself in your eyes. - You are impossible! - I cannot help my heart's desire. - Crush such desires. - My heart lies under your feet. Do as you wish. How can I handle this? How is your finger, Sir? Get a knife. I'll cut it off and throw it away. And tell the accountant that you've got a raise of ten rupees. Run away from here. Cleaning the house isn't enough. The entire village needs cleaning. - All are dirty here, small and big. - You're talking about the village. I say the entire country needs to be cleaned. Many big people came here to clean up but got cleaned up themselves. Yet they left their footsteps behind. But who walks on them? Every newcomer wishes to leave his imprint. Those who can't make them on the ground, do so on another's face... to satisfy their urge. What a statement! Do come in. - Go away! - Do come in. Go away! You two decide first if I should leave or enter. I have a summons for you. Do you wish to decide here... or in court? Why go to the court? I'll decide right here. Get him out of here, or I'll call the guard and have him thrown out. I'm not your father here. Don't forget that you stand here as a defendant. Let the trial begin. I don't think you'll be able to defend yourself. And I think that one hand was not enough to remove your illusion. You need another. This isn't a zoo; it's a courtroom. You two should address me. Where is your lawyer, Anju Devi? Who has called me? I'm here. What is the case? Tell me and I will ensure that the enemy is finished. Stop your blabbering! - Then you begin, Mr. Amar. - What are you saying! Sir, I'm lawyer Amarnath. I was sitting in my house today and... working on an important case. - Suddenly Miss... - Anju Devi. Miss Anju Devi descended on me like lightning and left... me shaken mentally and emotionally. Do you have anything to state in your defense? Whatever I had to state, I stated in his house. And if you weren't here, I would've left a mark on his other cheek too. By taking the law into your own hands... you have committed a grave offense. What right did you have? That right is available only to a London returned wife. Please remove yourself from here. You are a rat who is afraid of his own tail. Father... Your Lordship... Your Lordship, you know that this Mr., Mr., Mr... Amarnath. Mr Amarnath is fighting a false case against the whole village, for Sankat. I went to him with a request to drop the case... or he would be humiliated. He rolled his eyes and said that his heart was with me... - and not to break it. - He said that? Yes, and he said... to take the sea from him is not easy. Let alone one case, I'll forgive a thousand murders for that couplet. Please recite the full couplet. What kind of a case is this that I remember the bargain? Is this a court case or a poetry session? You've lost the case. Tell your client the court's verdict. - Congratulations. - I don't want to see your face! What are you doing? Let's go. How did you become the owner of the land? I acquired it legally. I pay a hundred rupees per year. Here are the receipts. Was there a fair last year or not? - It was held with my consent. - What is the problem this year? I've lost a full fifty rupees. They dug up my entire land. - There was no grass this year. - So, do you want fifty rupees? A man lives on money, the animals on grass. I don't wish to bear the sin of the animals starving to death. Very noble thoughts indeed. Did the villagers come to ask for donations? - They did. - How much did you donate? - Whatever I could afford. - How much was that? - Whatever I donated. - You have to give a clear answer. Five and a quarter annas, Sir. Do you know that the tent you tore up was erected with... the same donation? I didn't have it torn up. Isn't it true that last year you were given the contract for the tent? Yes. I'm a victim of the villagers' love. For the same love you've taken hundred and twenty five rupees... for which you haven't given any account. That is my weakness, that I don't keep any account of my love. I told you there is no ground for your case. Please go home. What kind of a lawyer are you? I wish to present my own case. The court permits you. But it would be wise to... engage a lawyer. - May I be of some service? - No! Who are you refusing? Don't you know your father... has agreed to your marriage with him? Please ask me whatever you want. I would like to see the land deed. Certainly, there is no secret. I want to see the deed. These are receipts. - The land deed? - The land deed. I hope my goat hasn't eaten it. I hope you haven't put it in a pocket and forgotten. Don't you believe me? Search your pockets. You may find it there. This useless paper has been lying in my pocket for a long time. Is this it? The first clause refers to the land for the fair. This clause by itself decides the case. It's clear that the land is reserved for the fair. Just as a hockey field is meant for that and cannot be... stopped because of the grass... so the fair can't be stopped because of the grass. By stopping the fair, Sankat has broken the law. Therefore he's responsible for all the losses. Is this the land deed? Yes sir. The court directs Sankat to pay the village hundred and twenty... five rupees as damages and desist from stopping the fair. I'm finished. This is my bill. Try and clear it early. Aunt! The fair will be held. The fair will be held! Kallu's mother, the fair will be held. Birju, you'll sell a lot of sweets, but use lots of sugar. The fair will be held. The fair will be held. - The fair will be held. - Go on, you liar. Swear by me. I swear by you, your father, your grandfather, your whole family. Sankat has lost! Why are you garlanding me? The case was won by Mr. Amar. Let's go and garland Mr. Amar. But who's going to bell the cat? Not I. You're scared. Give, I'll put it. He's not a lion who'll eat us up. The one who hesitates to go, may her husband be dark. Let's go then. You aren't satisfied wounding me? Now you want to get me hanged by falling under my car? The groom will be dark. So what can I do, if he's dark. Do I have to marry you? Not mine, their's. They ran away. You're very brave to stay back. What's in your hand? A bell. Are you mad? The next time you cross my path, I'll grab your neck and... Go away, you filthy thing! How can I show my feelings to my beloved? I have a very slim waist. How can I carry this heavy pot? There are ravagers of beauty along the way Here there are many scoundrels Who knows what someone might do to me? How can I go near them? I have put henna on my palms and oiled my hair I have come like a bride... and I will meet my lover today I bathed myself and washed my clothes Do you smell anything bad? I feel like kissing you I have a very slim waist. How can I carry this heavy pot? How can I show my feelings to my beloved? I've bathed and washed my clothes. Smell and tell me if I still stink. I don't, right? I feel like kissing you. You are so pretty. Have you seen your face in the mirror? See it today. I tell you, you'll fall in love with your own face. You wretch! You started looking into the mirror! Where are you going all dressed up? You've stolen my mirror. Who's face are you seeing? Sit down, in the name of your parents... your brother, and I who brought you up, in my name. You don't love any of them? Then sit down in your wife's name. You henpecked fellow! Remember what I told you? I'll cut you into pieces if you dance at the fair. - My reputation is at stake. - I will dance... I will dance so much that even you will dance. Listen to me, my beloved Don't worry if your heart is innocent I'm unable to say what I wish I am shy. How can I say it? Everything is in my eyes. You only have to look into them Don't worry if your heart is innocent Listen to me, my beloved My eyes are waiting for you You can have the smile upon my lips Don't go empty-handed from this fair Don't worry if your heart is innocent Listen to me, my beloved Telegram. Who's there? Why have you come here? Go away from here. Get ready so we can leave soon. I'm sure your father will recover after seeing you. When a capable son like you is near him... it will give him a new life. Where did you go? Where did you go? Speak! Where did you go? You rascal, cut me into pieces. Why do you hesitate? I'm not afraid to die. If you dare to eye me, I'll claw your eyes out. If you get in my way, I'll drive this knife through your heart. I hate you! I hate the whole world! I waited all night for you, fighting death. But you didn't come. Why did you take so long? What kept you away? The light in my eyes is fading. But your last letter is before me. I'm very happy that you and Anju... I am happy that you are willing to marry Anju. This ring is a reminder of your mother. Put it on Anju's finger as soon as possible and fulfill her desire. I don't deserve Anju, father. She is innocent. How can I deceive the one I love? But if I have to live, I can't do so without Anju. I can't destroy my life with my own hands. It would be a lie, a deception! I cannot give this ring to Anju. I must confess all to Anju. This is the right time. If this moment passes, I'll never be able to tell Anju anything. Never again! Then I'll regret it all my life. But how can I live without her? She is the ray of light in my dark life. But should I lose her forever, by confessing everything? Life without Anju is impossible for me. Why are you withdrawing from me? Won't you allow me to share your sorrow? Let me pay for my sins alone. But both our lives are one. Why are you torturing yourself? Why are you embracing this sorrow? Why don't you try and forget it? One can never forget one's sin. The more I try to forget, the more I remember it. The more I run from it, the more it confronts me. Your silence will suffocate me. I will willingly give my life to see you smile. My smiles have been snatched away from me. You seem thousands of miles from me, even though you're near me. I'm here, Amar. All your sorrows and problems are mine. All I know is that you are mine. Don't let my misfortunes affect your life. Go far away from me. I had dreamt of happiness with you. I saw you and felt I had attained heaven. Little did I know that one stroke of fate would change everything. I had no idea that one stormy night would spell such shame and... destroy all that I have. I was human and could not resist. You recall that I had received a telegram about my father's illness. I had hardly opened it when I also ruined my own life. I saw her with my own eyes. She was staring at me. She had poison in her eyes. It seems the same poison was flowing through my veins. Look at me. Your strange talk is frightening me. You aren't well. Your hands seem to be on fire. This fire will destroy me. Do you want to know what's happened to me? Do not worry, for everything is for you This moment may never return These beautiful days of spring... no one knows if they will return You live your way Don't listen to what others might say Don't mix up the thorns that live among the flowers Life is full of problems The boat and the waves are saying loudly... to cross life's river singing and laughing Do not worry, for everything is for you This moment may never return I wish to entrust this to you. I'm always afraid I'll lose it. I want to marry you soon and fulfill my father's wish. I thought you didn't love me. It's your love that has kept me alive. I'll talk to your father today. He's already decided the engagement date. An unmarried girl is always a liability. A husband like Sankat a rare find. He has fifty acres of land, has a grass business... and the entire village respects him. No one respects him. They only fear him because of his knife. Do you want his knife to hang over us, after giving... our daughter away to him? What good is a man who doesn't have a knife and a moustache? A knife and moustache are the two signs of manhood. If it were up to me, I would tie all those without moustaches... to an elephant's trunk. Everyone in the village will come to the wedding. All will have to be fed. And you will foot the bill. I'll have a grand wedding. You'll have to come on a horse. An English band will be in attendance. And the bill will be paid by you. Sankat, don't forget my gold bracelets. See that they are not bad. Otherwise you'll have to take back your marriage party. Take back your bracelets. I will not marry. If you don't marry, then... I'm a totally changed person now. I swear on you, I won't even harm a rat. I will be your slave always. Sonia, but for me, your calf would be finished. Sankat had it confined to a shed. I've had it released for eight annas. Give me twelve annas and take back your calf. That damn Sankat... Sonia, I am going. Listen you lawyer. Sonia, you know that if any man raises his hand to me... I'll crush him. Now see the fun. See how much your Sankat has changed. - You Advocate. - What's your wish? Slap me. What do you mean? Should I leave the village? It's my tongue's fault. It's not my fault. If you want, I'll cut it off. It's my bad luck to have gotten caught here. I'll never speak again. Slap me, not yourself. Behave like a man. I don't wish to be a man. Because of my word to you, I've become a coward. Otherwise I would have cut him to pieces. Why don't you do as I say? Why don't you slap me? My hand will not reach your face. I'll take care of that too. - Now slap me. - Shut your eyes, brother Sankat. I cannot look a lion in the eyes. Alright, now slap me. What are you thinking of? Slap me! Will you do it or not? What are your orders? Why don't you speak plainly? There's no secret from you. You know everything. She's my only child and such occasions come only once. Sonia is to be married. The landlord has given fifty rupees. And Anju madam has given clothes and a pair of silver anklets. Sonia has served you, too. You are very generous. May God bless your home too. May the sweet flute be played here too. It seems today is the test of my new life. Destiny is more merciful than the law. What's your opinion? You are no less Sir. You gave away your entire wallet. Was there a lot of cash in it? One doesn't consider money in matters of marriage. It's the milkman's daughter's marriage, sir, not yours. When your bride comes into this house, then watch how this... accountant squanders away your hard earned money. Take a bride, sir. It will bring joy to this house. There will be neither joy nor a bride in this house. - I don't follow, sir. - This house is cursed. I feel depressed looking at these walls. Have them torn down. - Are you joking? - Have I ever joked with you before? No. Then get rid of this house, these walls, and this roof. Have a new house built here. Sir, our mason is an excellent worker. He says that in fifteen days, before your engagement... he will have rebuilt this house so that you won't even recognize it. It will cost just nineteen hundred rupees. Imagine, a new house for nineteen hundred rupees. I told you that every brick in this house must go. Listen to me, my beloved Don't worry if your heart is innocent All my hopes are shattered Even though I love you... may someone else be blessed with happiness If there were no suffering in life... If all the world was a garden... then where would the deserts exist? It's good that one of us isn't known If all of us would come together... then where would the lonely ones go? Congratulate me, my love, as I've destroyed myself... and taught you what is true love If the candle doesn't burn... then where should the moth go? If all the world was a garden... then where would the deserts exist? You gave me suffering... and made me obliged to you Otherwise, where would I go to get them? If there were no suffering in life... The highest court in the world is man's own conscience. Listen to its voice and follow its dictates. Don't deny the poor their rights. God, give me strength. Sit down. I will not marry. Why won't you marry? Is he blind, or lame? - Why won't you marry! - Why are you beating her? - Leave my child. - Let her go! Don't beat this girl. You call her a human? If she doesn't marry, only her dead body will leave here. Sonia, why don't you want to marry? - I'm already married. - When? With whom? - What good is it telling you? - Who is the man? Where is he? - You have no right to ask! - Madam Anju, please leave. This is a matter for our community. Why don't you answer? Who married you? Who lit the fire around which you took the sacred vows? If you're married, then why hasn't he come to take you away today? If he has no courage, why are you quiet? Say who he is. If she doesn't reveal his name, then marry her off. You're getting her married forcibly. Don't get involved unnecessarily. Come along. This is unjust. I will not leave Sonia in this state. This marriage will not take place. I won't permit this sin. Whether you all believe it or not, I believe her. - She's already married. - If she is married... then let her go to her husband's house at once. - I have no place for her. - Forget the house. This shameless thing doesn't deserve to stay in this village! - She will disgrace all of us. - Do you want us to be defamed? Why are you separating me from my child? Don't you dare touch her! Come with me, Sonia. By taking her, you are insulting all of us. We live in huts, not in palaces. We can lose everything but not self respect. If you give Sonia shelter, we'll burn down your house. I'm not afraid of your threats. - Do whatever you want. Come Sonia. - Stop her! I'll cut off the hands of anyone that moves. You leave her, Madam Anju. I'll deal with them. Come Sonia. Sonia will stay in this village and in this house. Let me see what you can do. What are you staring at? Go away quietly. Did you not hear? Go away from here! Sonia, I have nothing against you. You had already refused me. It was I who was smitten. Why didn't you tell me who has ruined your life? Tell me his name. I'll bring him to your feet. If he won't come, then I'll bring his dead body. Just tell me his name, I beg of you. Forgive me Mr. Amar. Anger within me has blinded me. I have gone mad. I suspected you. You can never do such a thing. You are a saint, Mr. Amar. This is exactly like the story of Radha's love I can't stand being separated from you Please help me and bless me What justice is this? I'm lost. I can't help it Why have you done that? Where was my fault? I did it out of love for you. I'm yours and will remain so I am waiting for you. Take pity on me, remember me You made me a bride for the sake of love Please help me and bless me Do you want me to stay away? Come back to me and forget everything I can't give up my dreams of love You never asked me Bring back my hopes Rai Sahib, you should distribute sweets to all the poor people today. But you keep your mouth closed. Don't put this flower pot there. Left to you, you'll have me do all the household chores. You escaped narrowly. The bullet brushed your ear. Otherwise you would be in pieces. I couldn't find a son-in-law like Mr. Amar... if I searched forever on my bicycle. Stop everything and first throw this talking phonograph out. What are you doing, Sir? All the sweets will go waste. Put a stop to this broken record! If you throw me out, I'll inform the whole village... they're invited to a party at your house. The party is about land and property, about friends and foes. Let the whole world come, but don't you return. Father, look, I have been given a new life. I'm bursting with joy today. I feel like plucking the stars... from the sky and presenting them to Amar. I want to share my happiness with the world. The whole world will congratulate me on my good fortune. Let the applause of the people fill my house. Father, let me not become mad with joy. May God always keep both of you happy like this. Get some sweets for him. First I want him to place flowers at the Lord's feet. He has given my life a new meaning. Let's go. - C'mon. Let's go. - You go Anju. I'll wait here. Why? If you have faltered, why not confess before God? After all, I'm a human being. Then come on. I will ask for forgiveness on your behalf. Your heart is away from God You still won't come in spite of all your sins Come, if you have the courage. Come and ask His forgiveness This is the temple of justice and the house of God If you lose faith you'll suffer troubles and grief Even God will never forgive you These two hearts, neither of you know what's inside Only God knows what's inside Come, if you have the courage. Come and ask His forgiveness This is the temple of justice and the house of God My Lord, no one has returned disappointed from your altar. You have protected my love. Every pore of my body will sing your praises. A sin I committed has distanced me from you. It has distanced me from God. I now leave my fate in your hands. Please enter. Come in, Amar. Where did you go leaving Anju alone. The guests are eager for the function to begin. A prodigal who returns is not stamped as prodigal. You've spoken absolutely correct. I forgive your sins. But sit quietly in a corner. Can I sit in the corner where the sweets are? Please come in. You'll have to sing something colorful. I have no complaints Nor am I upset I am not upset or have any complaints I pray that you remain safe and sound I am not upset The road of love is very difficult Be careful when walking these roads. It is dangerous I have no complaints I see strange things happening with you Sometimes it's bright, and other times it's dark Somewhere it is dark The fate of the little lamps is strange Some are burning, and some are extinguished I have no complaints My congratulations on your new life Don't think about my sorrow Don't worry about my sorrow All these tribulations are destined, my friend It is neither your fault nor mine I have no complaints Friends, the party is over and you may go home. The truth is that I am very tired. Both because of the party, and my responsibilities. Now I wish to sleep in peace and quiet. Who knows, I may just keep sleeping. That is why I order Mr. Amarnath and Miss Anju... to set their marriage date quickly. What kind of game are you two playing like small children? You were just laughing, and now you are crying. For you both it's a laughing matter, but I feel disturbed. This kind of joke I... What's wrong, my child? You shouldn't get upset over small things. You're not a child any longer. Soon, you'll marry and go to his home. A decent girl has to go through so much in life. She has to make many sacrifices. I'll fetch Amar. You shouldn't be upset with him. I have the right to get upset a thousand times. Please don't get involved in this, father. Don't call him here. He should come on his own. If he comes on your calling, I'll never forgive him. At least forgive me for my mistake. It won't happen again. I'm going mad! From today I won't interfere at all in your affairs. You came and left without speaking to me Why did you do it? You never reveal to me what's in your heart I feel there's something in your heart... that doesn't show in your eyes I was waiting for you to take me I still don't know why you're avoiding me Why did you do it? There must be something in your heart for me Why do you avoid me? I wish to be beside you You came and left without speaking to me Why did you do it? Madam Anju, have you lost something? - Have you found anything? - Yes. Whatever you've found... it belongs to you. I don't deserve it. It's very precious. I have lost nothing. I had nothing anyway. Try and remember Miss Anju. Are you very happy today? Very happy! - Have you found him? - Who? The one with whom you are obsessed. He had never left my heart. What a beautiful picture, I can see. Fate has brought us before the same mirror today. Now I know that when one looks from a different angle... the whole world looks changed, too. It seems I'm seeing you for the first time. There's such magic in your eyes. Is this the magic you used on him? He says my clothes stink. Who is he Sonia? Tell me. No one is going to steal him from you. How can I tell? You can't hide him now. I can see him clearly in your eyes. His handsome face. The sadness of your separation in his eyes, I can see. I can't bear to see his sorrow. Tell him his share of sorrow is over. My share of joy is over. Shut your eyelids Sonia. Hide them. Take your ring. Are you making fun of me? I, too, am human. I, too, have a heart, but not of stone. I too have loved and know the price one has to pay for it. I have been cheated, but I haven't cheated anyone. I have destroyed my own life. I haven't destroyed anyone else's. Go away from here, Sonia! If she doesn't receive blood at once, the child will die. - Child! - Then she, too, may not survive. It's better if she dies before anyone knows. Make arrangements, doctor. I'll give blood. Anju, you may have to bear the blame for Sonia's sin. A calamity has taken place. Sonia has disappeared. The villagers think she's jumped into a well and died. I would have distributed sweets if she was dead. But she's alive. Right in this house. What's she doing here? She's about to become the mother of an illegitimate child. Congratulations! Let's celebrate with sweets. - Get sweets from the father. - Who's the father? Go find him in the village. What did you say? - Who are you? - Don't worry, take rest. Let me go! Don't be adamant Sonia. The doctor says that if... blood is not given, the child will die. - Let me go. - I'm with you. I want God alone, no one else. Let me go. You can go child, but not now. The trial has started. They are only awaiting you. Turn Sonia out of our temple. The temple is no one's personal house. It is God's abode. We cannot tolerate this sin in this sacred place. Sonia is at her Lord's feet. Who among you will remove her from there? We will! Oh God, why am I in this condition? My life has been ruined You're angry and have forgotten me It will be worse without the man for whom I'm waiting I've lost my way How I suffered cruelty Don't keep me alive in this sad condition I can't ask for life Oh God, take me away My heart is looking for him and he avoids me My life has been ruined You're angry and have forgotten me I couldn't bring him back Neither could I leave this life You're the source of justice Why have you ceased being just? Are you afraid? Why did it stop? Are you angry with God? Don't change your mind Even luck is against you My life has been ruined You're angry and have forgotten me If you take pity on me... you'd listen to my complaint You're not far. Don't forget me You see my condition yet don't answer my prayers Such is the life of the poor My life has been ruined It will be worse without the man for whom I'm waiting I've lost my way You're angry and have forgotten me Where will you run now? The villagers will cut you to pieces. Why don't you reveal the name of the person who has ruined your life? I can't blame anyone but myself. You want to conceal his sin by hiding his name? But I know who he is. I will cut him into pieces! Sonia, I couldn't avenge you. My knife failed me. My daughter is my only support in my old age. You know the law. Save her from jail. Have pity on this old man. I won't go away till you agree. You admit that... you used this knife to kill Sankat? - Yes. - Why did you kill him? He wanted... He wanted to destroy my life. The accused is lying and I wish to call a witness to prove that. Permission granted. Sankat was telling Sonia to reveal the man's name and tell the villagers. That he knew who that person was. If she didn't reveal it... then he would kill that person with the knife. But whose name did Sankat take? The question has no bearing on the case. The question is very relevant to the case. - I seek permission to ask. - Permission granted. Tell us, whose name was Sankat taking at the time? I did not hear the name. You must be forgetting. Remember it. I didn't hear the name. It's no secret that Sonia has a lover and she is about... to become the mother of that person's child. The accused is in love with him. That is why she has kept... his name secret. But when Sankat found out, the accused had no option... but to kill him to conceal the identity of the man. So she took the law into her hands and killed Sankat. The accused has committed a serious crime and... she should receive the maximum punishment. "The accused has committed a serious crime... and she should receive the maximum punishment." Your honor, the accused is innocent. She didn't kill. I have killed. You must punish me. I have killed. You should stop the proceedings and announce the sentence. The accused has admitted her crime repeatedly. These are lies. The accused is telling lies to the court. Shankat fell on his own and died. There is no proof or witness to support this. I have the proof, and the witness, too. Where is that witness, and where is that proof? If they're available, then why don't you present them before the court? I take an oath on this Holy Geeta and say that... I am that proof. I am the person Sankat wanted to kill... and who the accused wants to protect. I am the one who has ruined Sonia's life. This is the temple of justice and the house of God Express your wishes, don't be afraid You're responsible for your sins. You gave her your child Give her what's hers.
