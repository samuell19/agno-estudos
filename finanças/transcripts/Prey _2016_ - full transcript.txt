What? - My dad, if he sees you... You think I fear your dad? Don't be silly. Put that away. - And if I don't? [Objects clank] That guy again. I warned her, he is no good. Be glad he brings her home. I'll go thank him personally. [Engine running] [Dogs barking] Bloody... Johan? Johan? [Artis zoo of Amsterdam] [Clinic] Yes, seems enough. Am I interrupting? -What did we agree? I am here professionally. Because of that baby hippo. Then you are in the wrong department. I am early and I thought: let me visit my favorite vet. What's wrong with it? Tonsils? You're disturbing. Does she love it like that? The crocodile I mean. Or is it a male? Just like my handbag. Can't find anything in it. Iphone 5. Told you so. You owe me 25 euros. Those Samsungs are bigger. [Phone rings] It still works? - Possible. No, I just finished. Is it urgent? Okay, put me through. Sissy. -McDonalds, at the square. Bad idea, so early. Can you repeat that trick with the iphone? Lizzy. Is this work dangerous? No Dave. Cheating your girlfriend, that's dangerous. Did she say that? Don't believe everything you hear. That shouldn't be a problem. 30 minutes? You know, I think it's from digging all those animals. It releases fumes that ... -You'll manage, right Lot? No problem. -Where are you going? I'll be back in the afternoon. Something urgent. See you later, alligator. Don't forget our date tonight. - I hope I can make it. Come on, Liz. Can't you be a bit more friendly? We had agreement. You wouldn't just pop up here. There are rules here. Animals seem more important to you than your friends. In your case, it might be true. And where are you rushing off to now? A horse in a ditch? or a cat in a tree? Four stallions want to get wild. The hippos are next to the insect house. Take some time to fuck an ant. Lizzy Storm. -Yes, go ahead. Ms. Storm? -Lizzy. Olaf Brinkers. We have met before. Those red pandas we had fished out of the water. That illegal animal transport? - True, about six years ago. Looks like we aren't dealing with pandas today. I wish we did. The father of the family. Happened around 1 am. Where's his arm? At the same spot as his wife's head? His daughter and her boyfriend. Four victims? -There was another daughter. About five years old. We haven't found her yet. This can't be! Wild dogs? That boy had a criminal record and dealt with the wrong people. We can investigate that angle. I was in Tanzania for four years. In Manyara. I worked at the local hospital. Every week they'd bring someone in . ..if they had survived. I'm afraid you are gonna tell me something really strange. That's why you asked me to come here. I'd rather hear you tell me I am completely wrong. Are there any tracks? -Nothing so far. Because of the rain. Is there a chance, a slight chance, that you might be wrong? I know these wounds. I've seen too many. Inbred Rottweilers?* Pitbulls? [*Aggressive dogs] Not even close. Badr Hari? [*a violent kickboxer from Amsterdam] - Isn't he in prison? A man-eating lion. How am I going to explain this? [Lizzy:] You can sit and laugh about it, but it's really true. Bullshit. You're just saying that to impress. Dave, 5 people were killed. Yes I saw it in the news. They said nothing about a lion. They don't want to create panic. -Yes, but then what? If there's a wild lion, won't they take measures? If you want the scoop, keep it quiet. I promised that. Noone would believe me anyway. - Indeed. You have a reputation to uphold for that matter. What do you mean? No seriously! Don't start again about that chick in the club. I already explained that to you. She had something in her eye. So you helped her, with your pants dropped. It's fashion now to wear them a bit low. - That was last year. Didn't you say I lost weight? My clothes are too loose. Can we talk about that lion again? -What lion? Hi, Liz. That lion in Artis has twins. -Ah, no. Not again. Send someone else. That hippo also had nothing to say. You have to ask the right questions. -Funny... How are you doing? I can have him for two more weeks. Those dirty shorts and those hairs in the drain start to annoy. That's exactly how I felt. -But he's a sensitive guy. Yeah, I noticed. Okay that's enough, Maarten. Weren't fetching a drink? You are made for each other, I saw that right from the first time. Shall we order? I need some time. -You always take the Calamari. I'm talking about us. - I told you I'm sorry. It's not that simple. I am done with rocky relationships. I need to be able to trust you ... -You can trust me. Here... You can read all my Whatsapp's. -Not on an empty stomach. I'm improving myself, really. I'm ready for a serious relationship, Something deeper with mututal respect. You're watching too much Dr. Phil. -Sometimes he hits the nail on the head. I think I'm taking the Calamari. Is that a 'yes'? -'Yes' what? 'Yes, you can come back and deepen our relationship.' You mean have a deep fuck? That's part of it. -First food. Maybe I'd take something else than the usual Calamari. Always the same thing gets boring. Don't signal your friend, or I may change my mind. And that dirty underwear- I don't want to see anymore. Your car or mine? -I took the tram. That was optimistic. - You sometimes have to take some risks. Hey, Davy. -Hey... Where are you now with that tape? -Tape? Which tape? That porn tape you made of her, you dirty pervert. Oh, now he suddenly doesn't remember. Oh, that casting tape. -You filmed her showing her pussy. Were you going to make a film? For in cinemas? I never said that. Honestly. You know what we do with guys like you? - Hey, don't. Lizzy ... I'd like to hear it. We slowly squeeze your throat close, ..pull out your nails and then roast you over a fire. That sounds a bit cumbersome. Mind your own business. - Let him go. You'll get that tape tomorrow. Right Dave? Of course. No problem. You're warned. -Asshole. Totally crazy those people. What? -Carry on improving yourself Dave. Come on, he exaggerated. She wasn't naked. She was still on her panties. Grandma panties, really. Couldn't you behave just for two weeks? -Yes, hello. You kicked me out of the house. I'm not made of stone. Bye, Dave. I protest. -Why don't you go watch that tape. 113 meters. This is the one. In one strike, on the green. This is going to be a birdie. Birdie, birdie, birdie ... I can't take it any longer. -I'll just take him aside. Did you bring the papers? -Yes. Hey, you ball fuckers. Pay attention to the master. I hope he won't cause trouble. -Are you afraid of him? He can go pretty wild. - Just leave it to me. Damn, how is it possible? The wind here is stronger than you'd think. Your swing just wasn't okay, You should have hit him with a fade. You said I should use the five. That's why I never listen to you. You must hit it right. -I'll hit you right. Ho ho, Bram does have a point. - You two are ganging up as usual. Starting a business with you guys might be the biggest mistake of my life. Haha, just kidding. You thought I was really mad, didn't you? You should see the look on your faces. It is always fun with you two. One big party. Bring it a bit tactfully. Yes. Ball, ball. Where are you then, little rascal? Come out with your nice white face. Hendrik, we have to talk. -Ah, there you are. Do you know? why there are dimples in a golf ball? Dimples? -Yes. You don't know. General knowledge, Bram. That's what you two still lack. Jaap and I have decided that it cannot go on like this. Ah. Come on, Bram. It's just a game. What is this? -We want to put an end to it. An end? You can't be serious. You want to throw me out? Nothing personal, but you'll agree it's not working out. This can't be true. It is no bad deal, Hendrik. We have been very generous. You want me to sign this? Yes, by the dotted lines. Very wise of you Hendrik. This is very wise. Coming back to your question about those dimples... Don't move. -Bram. What have you done? -I did not do anything. Stay away. I knew it. I knew it. Don't. Listen! -Bram. What happened here? - There was some kind of animal. We have to call the police. 40 kilometers in one night. Is he running a marathon? He is big. -How big? Very big. At least 2 meters, 200 kilos. -Two meters? Without tail. -You are kidding. What are his hobbies, except running? It certainly involves people. And I'm afraid he prefers people from Amsterdam. A lion? No doubt about that? - All evidence points that way. But nobody saw it? - Correct. That puma in the Veluwe a few years back turned out to be just an overgrown normal cat. The injuries of the victims and the tracks are very clear. And where would it come from? Any reports of a lion escape ... from a circus or zoo? -None, we checked. Until the second century, thousands of lions still lived in Europe. It could be that some of them expand..... their habitat due to climate change. Great, more grist to the doomsayer's mill. In some Eastern Europian countries lions are kept as pets. As a status symbol. If one escapes, it won't be reported immediately to the police. It seems far-fetched to me. There have been many reports in recent years about stray lions. From all over Europe, even from England. Yes, I've read that. Last year in Paris ... Okay. Suppose you are right and we are dealing with a lion. What can we do? We can't put a fence around Amsterdam. Call in professionals, as quickly as possible. You mean hunters? Professional hunters. It is not some wild boar in the Veluwe. A man-eater, especially a lone man-eater, is extremely dangerous. Man-eater? Sounds serious. Once they've tasted human blood, they've no more fear. The last thing I want is turn Amsterdam into a hunting ground. Can't we discreetly search with dogs or something? Dogs are useless in the city. Comb one area at a time, to the entire city? -It's a pin in a haystack. You can't predict where they'll go. They hide by daytime, at dusk or twilight they hunt. That's the moment they are exposed, and you might capture one. Who all know about this? -The 3 of us and the forensics team. Let's keep it that way for now. The last thing I want is to cause panic. I instructed our inspectors to be on the lookout for wild dogs. See, that's the kind of useful ideas we need. Everyone is alerted without exactly knowing what's going on. I do not know. -Don't know what? Am sorry, but can't we be more open? Oh sure, let's put it on the front page of The Telegraph. "Man-eating lion prowls in Amsterdam" You have no idea of the consequences. It's less bad than covering it up. People have the right to be honestly informed. Cover up, sure. Big words. You sould put more trust in the government. So I assume that we are aligned. From now there's absolute media silence. We won't comment on how the victims died. Moreover the lion may have left already. [SMS from Dave: AT5! Now!] May be in Germany by now, chasing a Jerry* in Sauerkraut. [*a person of German descent] Can I turn on the TV? -Rerun of "Farmer wants a Wife"? ...immediately I slammed the door. You don't want a lion to walk in I'm still shaking, can you believe that? It is true that this morning one of our members was killed. But I don't know the details. Several other golfers saw a lion? I cannot confirm that. I find it hard to believe, frankly. The police won't comment on this, but clearly ... there is more going on here then they want us to believe. Some sources connect today's killing with the family tragedy yesterday. Whether there is indeed a stray lion.. ..killing people remains unclear. We will keep you informed. This was Maarten Gravestein, AT5. As soon as there is any developments, we will come back to you. The number of pigeons in Amsterdam is growing ... So much for media silence. I'd like to welcome everyone to this hastily called press conference. I will give the floor to the Chief of Criminal Investigation, Mr. Zalmberg. He will make a short statement. Then you get the opportunity to ask questions. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Several media have reported ... that there is an escaped lion walking around in Amsterdam. I cannot confirm nor deny this. There are indeed strong evidence that ... Hey guys, quiet! Look. So I ask all residents of Amsterdam and immediate neighbourhood.. ..to stay alert and report anything suspicious to the police. People who don't need to be outside, we advise you to stay inside. I can assure you that the police will do everything possible... to ensure the safety of our citizens. We will keep you informed of any new information. Any questions? - Has anyone seen that lion? Some witnesses appear to have seen the lion... but we cannot confirm that. There have been often reports of lions and panthers before. They never turned out to be true. Isn't this just scaremongering? We don't benefit at all from causing panic or unrest. On the contrary, I would say.... The people of Amsterdam have a right to be honestly informed. Amsterdam has dropped to 13th place on the list of most popular destinations. We lost our bid for the Olympics from under our nose. Is this an attempt to promote Amsterdam back on the map? Are there any serious questions? Would we have this problem ... ..if the arms of Amsterdam featured a squirrel? [*instead of a lion] A few years ago a shark was spotted in the canals of Amsterdam. It turned out to be an advertising stunt of a beer brand. Let me emphasize the seriousness of the situation. We count on the public's cooperation... and I assume that the press herein will also take its responsibility. If there are no further questions, then we'd end the press conference now. Well, that's what you get, if you give full disclosure. At least there is no panic. They won't wake up until it eats half the Ajax team. That might do the team some good. -What? Are you from Rotterdam? Don't be mad at me, are you? -I assume you didn't say anything. Those guys came to us. They had seen something but didn't want to go on camera. They were probably golfing in the boss's time. Hey, about yesterday ... -Not now, Dave. And? What happens now? That idea of ??a professional hunter stuck with the Chief. Good. I know someone. Stays in England. He has tracked and killed a dozen lions. Man eaters, each one of them. -Sounds professional. He is. If someone can catch that lion, it is him. Well, the Chief had some ideas about that too. About a hunter? -Yes. I want to see the lions. -Yes. No, there are none today. -Where are they? I don't know. Let's go home. Usually he is back in time for dinner. -Who? The escaped lion. You were looking for it, right? -Joker. Is there really one around in Amsterdam? -Looks like it. They are restless. - They have been all day. I can't get them to go outside. Let's be honest. Family is fun ... but you shouldn't be crammed together all day. Are you smoking that alone? Hey! Who paid for them? O... -What? Yuck, what's that? -An animal or something? A rabbit? Come on let's go. Take it. I don't feel like anymore. That smell. Can be a rat. Here you have those big rats. Stop it, man. You are making me vomit. Can I give you a hand? - No screen test today? There's a lion on the loose. We could die any moment. Let's enjoy these last moments. I didn't get the impression that your... colleagues there were worrying at all. Certainly. So worried, they all fled into the pub. Why do you think I'm here? To protect you. Well well, pizza from Dr. Oetkar. You should eat a bit more healthy. What? Hero? -What? You stood behind my back. I just put your bag down. -Yeah, to run away faster. I think you should relax a bit. Far too stressed. Let's go have a drink somewhere. Or eat something. Such a frozen pizza tastes like nothing. I don't want to go out tonight. -Why not? Hey, watch it, asshole. What did you say? - That your mother is a whore. Easy, Dave. You could have hit her disabled. -I was trying to hit you. Then you aimed badly. -Let me try again? Well, calm down guys. She can't stand the sight of blood. Smells good. -Roti, lamb and chicken. Listen -Hey! Here you go. -I also want that bottle of wine. Roti, lamb. Very healthy. I had to take two meals though. Very lame, to bribe me with roti. -Oh yeah I forgot it's your favorite. What do you mean 6 roti? I ordered 8. - This is what I got. I swear. Look, it's on the receipt. And my free bottle of wine, where is it? That's with 8 rotis. You only had 6. Are you completely out of your mind? Sergio! What? Which customer? I just came from there. No, 6 roti, that's all I received from you. I swear. You take that back. Take that back! I'll cut you up man, I swear. Leave my sister out of this. Leave my mother out too. And your grandmother is also a whore. You've got to see this. That's no dog poo! And also, no horse poo. What did you say? -Never mind. There! You are in its place. Expensive wine. Fuck. Missed something? - Two elderly people stuck in a lift. What about the opening of that new bicycle parking? You read my messages? - You said I could. See how boring my job is? Can't you get me an appointment with that lion? He can keep his clothes on. I missed you, Liz. -Yeah, calm down. Don't think everything is fine again only because I was horny. Any news? -No, but that doesn't mean anything. He may well have made victims that we don't know of yet. Are you gonna call Jack? -I already did. And? -Voicemail. At least he's still alive. He is the best. -Yep. At hunting lions, I mean. I know that's what you meant. Maybe he doesn't want to come at all. Right now he is not even allowed. The chief has someone else in mind. Well, perhaps it's for the best. You didn't really part as friends. This is strictly professional. -I'd favour that rule. You're not jealous, are you? As long as he only hunts lions. Who will be hired now? -No idea. I heard it's someone with a lot of experience. I heard that, yes. The things you see! Unbelieveable. That's right. Last year only, in Zambia. Killed 3 rhinos and a gorilla. What? Are you serious? Should not be a problem. I can use a new rug. This afternoon already? No problem. Then I will cancel the Rotary. No, we'll work it out. I have a few overspeeding tickets, if you can take care of those. Great. See you later. Wow, Dad. Are we going to shoot a lion? - Have you been listening in again? I'll shoot him straight through the head. Pang! You won't shoot anything. This's too dangerous. This is for professionals. Why can't I ever come? If you keep nagging, I'd never take you to the girls again. Come to papa. Lions follow clear routes. If we continue his route we come ... right here. The Vondelpark*? [*a 47-hectare public garden] - Exactly. That's where we get him. May I ask what exactly is the purpose? -You are? Puttermans, GroenLinks party, south administrative sub-council. The last thing we want in south... ..is a shooting spree in Vondelpark. And if I'm not mistaken, isn't the lion a protected species? I don't think lions that eat our citizens ... have claim on their protected status. The Vondelpark is the place par excellence where people can enjoy their peace. I'd like to see that all regulations are met. For example, do you have an event permit? Or, am I asking for something weird? Who invited that clown? -Procedure. As of yesterday there is an emergency regulation is in force. If you had oriented yourself before, you'd have known that. We are allowed to take every measure needed to protect the public. My cousin is a big wild hunter with years of experience. He thinks nothing of lions Does this look like the big cat? I think we have the right man. Let me know if you need anything, Theo. I am ready. I have stood before hotter fires. Tomorrow night, you and me will share a lion steak. This is going to be a disaster. -He has killed quite a few. I know those safaris. They drug those poor animals ... and tourists may shoot them at close range. It is just animal abuse. I have no compassion for this one. -This one is not drugged either. And be careful. He has no idea what he's upto. Vegetarians must leave now. I'll go make some space in my belly. Can't I take a shit without being disturbed? Attention, attention. Because of park maintenance & cleaning operation, everyone must... ..leave the park before 6 pm. Cleaning operation? 6 pm, not a second sooner. I'll go try find Brinkers. Hi, where are you? -Emergency. Johanna has had contractions. Johanna? The one with the trunk, you know? Where do you sit? At the park. It has been cleared, we are not allowed in. Rightly. Just stay where you are, it's dangerous. You sound worried. - I am. Delivery is always difficult. Be careful. -Always. Brinkers. Let's set up here. Yes, okay? The Vondelpark has been evacuated and tightly sealed ... ..due to a cleaning operation. But I don't see many cleaners. Can you please explain to me what's going on here? I can tell you it's over a search for the lion. And how certain is it that lion is in the Vondelpark? We have clues, but unfortunately nothing in life is certain. I understand that a hunter has been hired? That's right, it's beyond the expertise of the police. So you need hired professionals there. I am confident, after tonight, Amsterdam can breathe relieved again Thank you. Do you have it? Those mating calls sound pretty real. Was it even fake? There he is. Come on. The helicoper is on its way. Any news? All exits are sealed and invigilators surround the entire park. Good. -Mr Zalmberg, a few questions... Is it true that the lion is in the park? We heard him roar. That is the approach of a professional hunter. Those mating calls are one of the ways to lure him ... to the point where you want it. And then ... Poof. So that lion is being caught tonight? -Come. All that chatter is pointless. -Well, what do you want? We should be there. - Don't be crazy. What are you doing here? -Silent, the lion must be close. It is not close. I am. -I just wanted to help you. You will never go to see the girls again. I see two persons arguing & fighting. Two persons? And the lion? -Negative. Visibility is getting worse. Gie me that gun. -Why? You'd shoot me before you know it. Here with that! -Base to Papa Alfa. -Yes? How are you doing? We heard a lot of roaring. There it is. -Theo? Guido, stay here. -Theo. Hurry up. Shoot. What's happening? Did he get the lion? Police Zero One, come in. Police Zero One. It doesn't look good. Dave, easy man. I ... I'll call the editor. Jesus. Papa Delta, This is Police Zero One. -Papa Delta, come in. We're following the lion through the park. He's fast. Position? -Direction Emmastraat. Post Emmastraat, come in. -We heard. I lost him. We have a visual. He left the park. -What? Where is he now? On the Eeghenstraat, heading east. Keep updating your position. -Still on the Eeghenstraat. Who is near the Cornelis Schuyt? -502 is on its way. 204 is also on its way. We lost him. - What do you mean, lost? He suddenly disappeared. -They lost him. Man, you won't believe this. Let's go before we are arrested. Hey you two! Pussy, pussy. Hello, Lizzy speaking. Brinkers. Sorry to disturb you. -I've heard it. Didn't go well. How do you know that? -I know someone at AT5. And now? I wondered, that contact of yours in England. That hunter. We'd appreciate if he could get here as quickly as possible. There is a budget for it. A big budget. I already called him. Tomorrow morning 7 am he arrives at Schiphol. Tomorrow morning? That is amazing. You're welcome. One thing... Okay. You can go. With the kind help of your girlfriend. ...killing the hunter and his son. Two casualties in Tram line 2. Six injured passengers hospitalized. Three of them are in critical condition. The mayor expressed his condolences for the victims. Witnesses have since confirmed that it is a lion. We advise people to stay at home. Close all windows and secure doors. For the third night in a row, a refugee center in Wassenaar... I warned them. Amateurs. -It was horrible. Those images show only half of the carnage. You are also shaking now & then. -Yes, it was cold breeze outside. Are you nervous? -Why? Well, exciting day tomorrow. Your ex is coming. You haven't seen in years. Eight years. -That can be pretty disturbing. I'm over it, Dave. And you'll be nice to him. Of course. But after all your stories, I'll keep watch on him. Do not believe everything you hear. -That's my line. You can't stay here tonight. I don't want to stay here either. Maarten wants some shots in front of the police head office. I'll risk my life, going out. The lion won't bother you. He has his belly full. Take care. Right on time, no delay. Very well. We have room booked in hotel l'Europe. He can stay as long as he wants. I hope he can get started right away. - He wouldn't want it any other way. There he is. What is that? - He can't stand flying. Mr. DelaRue? We have arrived. Lizzy! My beautiful flower. Be careful, you silly bastard! You should have told me. Then you'd have been thrilled. That man is severely disabled. How am I going to explain that? I am also very curious about that. It's 10 o'clock. -He'll be here any time. We got him to his hotel, so he could... ..freshen up. I was happy I now have something positive to report to the mayor. I owe thanks to you. It was indeed maybe not such a smart choice to ... ..hire my cousin. Well, he fought like a ... If this doesn't work ... Jack DelaRue. Reporting for duty. Good to see you Jack. Nice wheels. Hmm. Latest in transportation for the disabled ourselves. Liz, you looking fucking beautiful today. -Thanks, so do you. Hello, I'm Jack. -Yeah, we met at the airport. Did we? Which airport? Only joking. You're the cop, right? - Yes I am. So where's the kill? Nice park. I'll show you. It's right over there. Yeah I can smell it. Brinkers, this is a crime scene. Not everyone... You can't be serious. That man only has one leg. -I noticed too. The bait is too low. Tent was in the wrong place. Should have been downwind, of the bait. How do you know which way the wind was blowing yesterday? I checked. It was East-south-east, 2.4 meters per second. 1.6 when the fog came up. Figures. Male, 7.2 feet, 480 pounds. Man eater? What did I always tell you? -What? Never call a "man eater" by its name. Or else be its next victim. Yes, likes to eat people. Superstition. That way. He smells a pile of shit and knows where the lion is? No, he's just hungry. So what do you think? You tell me. You are the expert. In my opinion... This is a damn god hotdog. - I concur. So where do you think this lion came from? Am not sure if I want to tell you. - You know? Of course, I let it loose. So I could get close to you. I knew you would call me. - Yeah sure. So how's that boy treating you? -Dave? He's okay I guess. As long as he treats you with more respect than I did. -We had some good times too. Sure we did. You still got it. -Hmm? Treasure it with my life. Be nice to Dave. A good man is hard to find. -I will. My God, he's a big fella. Almost as big as the one that had my leg for dinner. Eastern Africa, nubica*. [*East African lions = Panthera leo nubica] He is a long way from home. So this happened two minutes after the attack in the park? Yes. I've never seen anything like it. He is extremely fast. And hungry. So how are you going to catch this beast? This is not a beast. This divine creature is the king of the jungle. A noble and proud warrior. These lions are symbol of strength, courage and authority. A supreme warrior with a heart of gold. Only kidding. I'm gonna track him down and blow his fucking brains out. The cops are sissies. They shit their pants when a cat jumps from the tree. Now Eddie here, served in Bosnia. How many Muslims did you kill? I don't know. A lot. And Gerrit here, single-handedly slit the throats of 3 bulls. Too much to drink. Me that is. Leave that lion to us. We'll let him know he's fucking with the wrong country. Another proof that Amsterdammers won't let yesterday's events.. ..get the best of them. Maarten Gravestein, AT5. Thanks guys. Complete assholes. What about your fucking brother? Did he arrive yet? If all went well, he's already here. Keep an eye on him. Make sure he hunts the right prey. So where will he attack next? Imposible to say. He can turn up anywhere. An unpredictable bunch of bastards. Can we put traps? Only if you want to catch little kids or dogs. So we just have to wait till he kills again? -No, One thing is for sure.. Once they've tasted human blood, they'll stick to that money. So how do we find him? We don't find him. He has to find us. Lions are very possessive of their kill. -What does that mean? Once they have killed their prey, they'll come back eat it. And prevent anyone else from eating it. So we lure him with what? My cousin? He wants to use my cousin as bait? According to him, it is the only way to lure that lion. And you apparently think that's a good idea? Don't you have a shred of respect? The nerve to even suggest such a thing! Send that cripple back to London. And? He didn't really like the idea. Too bad. What about that son of his? I didn't ask. So, you gonna show me the Red Light District? -Red light district? Van Gogh is closed. It's no use waiting here. We'll be in touch, Olaf. Verhulst family. Kim speaking. Yes Madam. They are not allowed outside. I told them. Don't worry, they are playing in the nursery room. I will. You're cheating. -No, I'm just better. Loser. No. What did I tell you? And where is Tommy? I like Amsterdam. I really do. Isn't there a lion in the coat of arms of Amsterdam too? Yes there is. You see. Everything happens for a reason. You sounding spiritual suddenly? -Am sorry. So. Are you seeing someone? Yeah, the nurses from Saint James' Hospital I see a lot. Why? -Because they are bloody sexy. And besides ... The big C got me in my liver. You got cancer? -Quiet! My insurance broker is here, I won't be able to afford the policy anymore. How bad is it? One year. Two tops. They can be wrong. Mostly aren't. I'm sorry. -Ah don't be. I got a fantastic life. And some wonderful people. Sorry, are you the lion hunter? -Yeah, I suppose I am. Why the wheelchair? - Because a lion bit off my leg. No you are joking. The fucker didn't live to tell the tale. Can..can we offer you a drink? Sure can. Yeah..whiskey, thanks. My friend here is a hunter too. -He is? He hunts women. Hey what bait do you use? I can't tell you in public, but it's big. ...with a special news bulletin It looks like the lion roaming free has made a new victim. At a playground in Amsterdam South... Dave? Why aren't you here? -Where? Here in South. He has grabbed a little boy. Damn. What is it? What's this, why weren't we told? -Sorry. We have opted for a different approach. Zalmberg wants nothing more to do with Jack. -What did he say? -They don't need you anymore. -Don't they? -Am sorry it had to be like this way. Mr. DelaRue. I hope you understand my decision. Not really. What's the plan? We've surrounded the forest where the lion is hiding. Who's the guy in the wheelchair? Cool man. Then you have nothing to worry about. Govt has provided us with a highly skilled SWAT-team, that will track down the lion and kill it. Sounds like a watertight plan. It is. And highly preferrable to your plan.. ..full of bodies of recently deceased family members. I'm not so sure about that. You check with Brinkers here. He'll take care of your expenses & travel arrangements. I believe your return flight is tomorrow morning. Thanks, appreciate it. Jesus, how stupid can they be? You are always so beautiful when you are angry. Sure. You should know. Hi, Dave. Ah! So this is Dave? Hi, I'm Jack. Lizzy told me a lot about you. -Ah.. Hope it wasn't all good. You are lucky man, Dave. - He knows. So? What is happening? You are off the case, or..? Seems that way. Those idiots think they can manage without Jack. - Yeah it's an impressive outfit. As long as they don't shoot each other. So, you gonna stay here, or..? No, I don't think that'll serve any purpose. - Want me to take you back to the hotel? Let's have dinner. The three of us. My treat. -Well, I don't know. Have you eaten yet? -No, but... You have work to do, don't you? -Not really. I was already on overtime. That's settled then. Liz, you choose the restaurant. Keep it nice, huh? - Why didn't you tell me? What? That he is in a wheelchair? Is it a relief? -No, but... Not everything about him is paralyzed. -What? This works just fine. Did you arrange it? That interview? I'm going to do it now. Team-3 leader, status? Leader team-3, negative. Our sector is clear, over. Team-2, status of your sector? -Negative, nothing here. Stop. There was another one of those bastards. He wasn't too happy by the fact that I just killed his mate. Understandable. Bloody dangerous too. I only had one bullet left. -Oh my God. I knew I just had one chance. So I sneaked up downwind from him... I got myself into position. Very slowly took aim. Right then my stomach growled. Fuck I hadn't eaten all day. It growled. Like a horny lioness. That caught his attention. Just at that moment my shot went off and hit him in the shoulder I think. He leapt at me and I fell back. I took out my handgun and I shot him right in his left eye. That killed the bastard. -Unbelieveable. Great story! Take it easy, Jack. Didn't we order the surprise dessert? -Mr Delarue! -What do you want? Am sleeping. You can come with me. The restaurant dropped all charges. What restaurant? Mr. Zalmberg would like to see you. -Who the fuck is Mr. Zalm-whatever? He is the Chief of Police. -I'm going home today. Well... I cancelled your ticket. What the fuck did you do that for? Take him up. That's it, as high as you can. Little more, Sir? Right to the top. Okay. Tie him up. We lost a day. Jack cannot guarantee anything. I know. So be it. You know the deal, right? Not a frame becomes public until it's caught. Exactly. Are you happy now? -I'm happy if you are happy. We have got pretty right bait. Should do the trick. Are you sure you want to do this alone? You guys would just be in the way. Where's your tent? Tents are for boy scouts. -No game caller? You pulling my leg, right? -Yeah, both of them. Ah I knew it. He can be funny. Are you sure about the helicopter? No chopper. The slightest sound could scare him away. Good hunting, Jack. Make sure you got a good story to tell later. - Will do, Dave. Don't push it, Olaf. Good luck man. Ok going to radio silence now. But my dog ??is still in the park. - Nobody is allowed in or out of the park anymore. But I can't just leave my dog behind! Sandwiches are coming. -Where is your boss? Meeting the DA and mayor about declaring a state of emergency. Sounds heavy. - I hope it won't come to that. One lion disrupting an entire city. This is not just another lion. Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? -Where were you? In North. Car upside down. Three dead. Yes, lion or not, life does go on. Yeah... I lost him. He's still in the park. Be careful. You don't wanna mess with a wounded lion. Oh my God. Jack, where are you? I don't know. Somewhere in the south of the park. What happened? The body is gone. What the hell are you talking about? -It's not in the tree any more. You are kidding me. Fuck. Fuck, this is no good. -What? He has been surprised. He knows what he's doing. We have to help him. He doesn't need any help. -Let me go. It's way too dangerous. He is a hired gun, he gets paid. He doesn't do it for the money. He doesn't want a cent for it. Damn. Jack! What are you doing? - Tracking the lion. What's that building over there? University of Amsterdam. Medical Faculty. -Corpses, huh? Lots of them. They doing autopsies. Fuck! We have to let the police know where we are. -There's no time. Oh my God. Looks like he took the delivery entrance. You wait here. -No I won't. Take this. Am sure you remember how to handle it. [Static in wireless Phone] [Static in wireless Phone] No more than a few minutes. - We have to call. He can't be far. I can smell it. Come on, you bastard. [Static in wireless Phone] Hello? Is anyone there? Where are you? 642, where the hell were you all this time? That was quite an entrance. - Oh my god, look at you! You don't look so good yourself. -I'll live. Not sure I can say the same. Here, look what I found. You going to kill yourself? You need to clean up the mess I made. He has to follow the new trail. -What new trail? Are you sure about this? It's the only option. He's after me. Liz, can I ask you a favor? -What? Can I see you naked? One last time? I was just kidding. Asshole. Cut away. Am not sure this is such a good idea, Dave. Stand still. Show your hands. We are from AT5. Amsterdam's leading news channel. Great. I feel like a more balanced person now. Hurry. Go there. Hurry! Are you sure? -You go. I will be swarming with press. I got a head start. There's another ambulance if you want. No, I'm driving with Jack. Is everything alright? Few cuts. A bit of fresh air can't hurt. And don't miss your press moment. Not my kind of moment. -Mine neither. No, it's closed. They are working there. The N32 is just as fast. Here, left here. -No man. We have to go right here. Can I borrow a mobile? -Yes of course. Thank you. Dave. -Me here. How are you? Okay. You? Yes I'll manage. You had great timing, by the way. Worked hard on it. I wondered, where will you sleep tonight? Not thought about it yet. At Maarten's place, I think. If you can't go there then I know another place. Salvation Army? -Something better. Maarten says he already threw my stuff out. What a friend. You can't trust anyone anymore nowadays. Then you will come to my place? Yes, I'd like that. How is it going there? Are you almost done? A few more shots. Unbelieveable what power that beast had. He broke in through a double glass window, jumping into that building. Window? What do you mean? He entered through a basement door. No, he didn't. The tracks are very clear. I'm just a layman, of course. Dave? Uh, Liz? Hey, what? I can't hear you. What? - I thought I heard something. Did it sound like a bell? In the other direction? Away from the building? I heard it again. -What did you have tonight? You are seeing lions everywhere. -Oh my God. Close that door. -Easy, nothing to worry about ... Together we can easily afford. Let's wait & see how you like national TV. It's not the same as AT5. You still don't trust me. -I place most trust on myself. And, a little in you. Well, it's a start. Where is Simba? Simba! He was just here. -Simba!! He will be back. Are you sure it was only two lions? Very funny. Simba! Hey, hello. See, he was just going around. -Sorry. Who names their dog Simba? That is asking for trouble. Well, what then? Bambi?
