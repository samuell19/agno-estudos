Tonight's film is a dramatization of events surrounding the adoption of the boy known as Gregory K. None of the individuals portrayed participated in the making of the film. (gentle melancholic music) (birds chirping) Boy, this place is in the middle of nowhere. I think you'll like it. You like horses? Don't know any. (Jordan laughs) (car door clicks) (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) (group chattering) (gentle music) (door clicks) You've been very helpful. Okay, Gregory, why don't you just, uh, why don't you just wait in there for me for a minute, okay? I won't be long. Hi. Hi. Here to see Abe Dunn. (door bangs) Just put your name right there. Over here. Let's get this paperwork out of the way, so I can show you to your room. You can meet your roommates, okay? All right. Name? Kingsley. Gregory. Not Gregory. Shawn. Shawn? Your name is Shawn? Hate Gregory, it's my father's name. People who didn't know him called him Ralph. He didn't care as long as he got what he wanted. That's it. Hello, Reverend Dodge, I am Ralph Gregory Kingsley. Give me my kids. (chuckles) (car door clicks) Come on. Come on. Wanna see your little brothers? (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) I wonder why Rachel picked Florida to run off to. Let me hold the court order. (door knocker tapping) Hey, hey. (door clicks) Hey, uh, Reverend Dodge. Yes. Are you the foster parent of Zachary and Jeremiah Kingsley? Yes, I am. Who? I'm Ralph Kingsley. Oh, yes, of course, the state social worker called this afternoon about a visit. Uh, I, I didn't come to visit. I came to, to get 'em. Oh, you, you mean you wanna take the boys today. Yeah. Well, um, Alice. Alice. Uh, my work, uh, took me out of the state for a couple years, but as soon as I got back in the area I tried to find my boys. What do I find? My wife Rachel has, uh, abandoned 'em and moved to Florida. I don't understand her. I, I just don't understand. Mr. Kingsley wants to take the boys today. Oh. After so much time don't you think a little visit to let them get used to the idea. Look, I got the court order right here. Not now, hon, no. Uh, this is Francesca, my second wife. Uh, well, I mean I'm sure the Reverend didn't mean that he suspected us of any wrong doing. Uh, no, no, no, of course not. I was just surprised. Why don't I come in and we can pack their things? You sure you don't wanna wait a couple of days? (gentle music) Mam, uh, I haven't seen my boys in four years. Zachery? Jeremiah? Look how big you got. I can't believe you guys. I'll never put you in foster care. Never. I love you. I can't believe it. (door clicks) Come on, Zachary. (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (gentle brooding music) Where's Mom? Do we look like you? I don't know. I don't wanna look like you. You're ugly. She left us with Aunt Bess after Christmas. And when she didn't come back Aunt Bess got mad and gave us up. That's how we got with them. Mom still look like that? I think so. It's pretty old. Yeah, five years old. (sighs) Just before I visited Dad. Where you been all this time? Ralph moves a lot. Don't, don't forget Jeremiah's medication. It's for hyperactivity. Oh, he don't need that stuff, just makes him worse. (car door bangs) Did you drink all this? You must be an alky. Maybe you can mouth off to your momma, but don't you ever talk that way to me. Not to me. You little halfwit. Your life is with me now, understand? You understand? (car engine revving) (siren wailing) (group chattering) Where do we go? Okay. This way. Get the door. Dr. Coblen, Dr. Robert Coblen, call the operator. Dr. Holden, Dr. Stewart Holden, report to OR. Here they are. I don't think there'll be an permanent eye damage. Look, this is the second time he's shown up with these kind of injuries. Well, let's see what the father has to say. Dr. Edward Thatcher report to emergency. We wanna keep Jeremiah overnight for observation. Oh, God, no. Doctor, why? To be frank, your son's injury requires an investigation. I'll se ya later. What for? An investi? Mam, you know Jeremiah's always falling. He's really clumsy. You know we were just playing with our rabbit and he fell off the back porch. Well, Gregory, that may be true, but I'm here to respond to a hotline call for child abuse. What? We're, we're being accused after what his mother did? Is she saying that you hit us, Dad? Yeah. Mam, he wasn't even there. Look, uh, you come on out to the house. You come out and see for yourself. We've got ourselves a good home, a good home. Well, I really hope so. But either you leave him overnight at the hospital or we will take him into protective custody. Protective what? Shh! You! Shh. All right. Get your coats, come on, get your coats. Dr. Micheal- Come on. Please call the operator. As soon as we get him back we start packing. It's time Rachel was responsible for Jeremiah and Zachary again. Come on, get your coat, come on. (birds chirping) (car doors clicking) You got that? Yeah. Come on, come on, let's go. (car door clicks) Let's go. Come on. Stay here. She don't wanna see you. Come on, come on! Oh, my boys, you've grown so much. Oh, my baby. I love you. Go inside. You old dirtbag. Rachel. Rachel. The whole family is furious with you for putting those kids in foster care. Maybe if I had so help from their father it wouldn't have been necessary. We're gonna work together and raise these kids right. No more disappearing acts. Ralph's found us a place down in Clearwater. We'll be in touch. What about Gregory? He stays with me. You've had him almost five years! I want him back! Rachel. He stays with me. (gentle melancholic music) Get in the car. Get in the car. (car door bangs) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) (car engine revving) (tires squealing) (insects chirping) (wind blowing) (gentle melancholic music) (laughs) You think she gives a damn about you? Give me that. Hey. Give me it! Oh, yeah. Give me that! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (upbeat country music) (group chattering) What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, is he all right? Okay, okay, I'm coming. What, Rachel? What happened? My husband beat my boy Gregory. He's waiting for me at a police station in Clearwater. That's two hours away. I guess I'll take the bus. Don't be silly, I'll take you, all right? You all right? Yeah. Yes, 9th Precinct, yeah. That's right. Um, I'll just, uh, yeah, that's correct. Okay, calm down, mam. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay, mam, I just need some information here, all right? Excuse me. That's right, yes. Uh, just bear with me one minute here. (police radio chattering) (gentle melancholic music) Hey. Mom. Hey. Mom. You all right? Huh, you okay? Yeah. Let me look at you. Oh. Oh, my boy to just take your little face in my hands and tell you how much I love you. Don't let them send me back to him. You're not gonna go back to him. He's not gonna get his hands on you again. Don't you worry. We're gonna be together forever, okay? Okay, I promise you. Yeah. Promise you. You're my boy, huh? My baby boy. Yeah. I love you, Gregory. I love you too, Mom. (group laughing) (upbeat music) Get out of here. Get away. (group chattering) What's going on? Jeremiah, just go back to bed. Just go back to sleep. (group chattering) Hey, hey, Oh. What is that, what is that over there? (group chattering) Okay, okay, come on, come on. (group chattering) Okay, let's go! Okay, okay. Come on you guys I wanna see it. Okay, sure. (group chattering) Okay, go for it, go for it. Yeah. (group chattering) Are we getting out of here? (laughing) (group chattering) No, I don't know. I don't even know, I know. Oh, wait, wait, this is my oldest boy, this is my oldest boy Gregory. Hey, Gregory. Gregory. Honey, go back to bed. This is Momma's time, okay? So she, I was waiting for her about I don't know five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. (Rachel laughs) Okay, you guys, ready? All right, honey, go back to bed, sweetie. Look at him, he's so cute. I love my kids. He's so cute. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, you ready? One. Hey. Go for it, go for it! (group chattering) (birds chirping) No. What do you got? Last night's pizza. (box thuds) Hey, cereal. (door clicks) (door bangs) Hey, guys, you're up. Hi, Renee. Hi, Renee. Good going. Jeremiah, you've been wearing this shirt for two days. Off. Where's your mom? Asleep in there. Rachel, get up! (group yelling) Rachel! (group grunting) What? Stop it, stop it! Get off! Stop it. Come on, guys, get off. Come on Zach. Okay. Gregory. We're going. Go, out, out. We're going, we're going. Out, out. Going. I never get any peace around here. Rachel, if you wanna get food stamps before you go to work you gotta get up now. Oh, you didn't even fill those forms out yet, did you? I don't qualify for food stamps. They say, "I make too much money." (Renee laughs) Landlord wants us out of here by Monday. No. I don't know where to go. Can we stay with you for a couple days? Uh, Rachel, I've been telling you for six months you- Oh, god, here we go. Gotta look for a place you can afford with three kids. You can afford to buy new dresses. If I don't look good I'm not gonna get tips. You can afford to go drinking every night. You, you just don't understand. Oh, the hell I don't. I have a kid too. You don't have these kids. Oh, why don't you blame the sun, and the trees, and the air that you breathe. I'm out of here. Sorry, Gregory. Bye, Renee. (door clicks) (door bangs) Give me the key. No, it's my key. It's my keychain, I get to open the door, Jeremiah. Come on, let me open the door. No, you can't open the door. Get away. I get it. (door bangs) I wanted to open the door. Well, you can't open the door. Mom, I thought you were at work. Mom. Did your mom tell you why you were going into foster care? (Rachel crying) No, she never did. Some lady just showed up to take us. Mom said, "It was only gonna be a month." Turned out to almost be a year. But your mom completes her performance agreement and you got to go home again. Oh, yeah, for two whole months. (phone ringing) Now, Gregory. My name is Shawn. Maybe we'd better discuss that. Abe, if he want's to be called Shawn. We should never encourage behavior that undermines reunification. Well, I think that, uh, Shawn wants to start a whole new life. Well, he can't. Look, your mom is working very hard to get you back, and well, you belong with her and with your brothers. Do I? And Momma's got her high school equivalency now. Great, Mom. We're gonna have a whole new life now, Gregory. Gonna have a good life. You are never gonna have to go into foster care again I promise you, I promise you that, okay? Gonna tell? Gonna tell her, Shawn? Don't Jeremiah! Mom. Tell her what? He changed- Mom. His name. Zachary. Shawn, it's Shawn. I told you not to tell her that, Jeremiah! Just stop! I don't care! I told you! Will you shut up? Shut up! Why'd you have to tell her that? (door bangs) (Gregory sighs) (knuckles tapping) (birds chirping) (door clicks) Hi. Hi. Is your mom at home? Yeah. Who are you? I'm Jordan McLean, HRS. That's Health and Rehabilitative Services. So, uh, where's your mom? In here. Thanks. (switch clicking) Listen, uh, why don't you go wait in the bedroom while I talk to your mom, okay? Yeah. Okay. Mrs. Kingsley. Mrs. Kingsley. I'm responding to an abuse hotline report that you were planning to put your children out in the street. Mrs. Kingsley, are you planning to put your children out on the street? Uh. Can I, can I put 'em up for adoption? Well, no, you don't have to make that decision right away. There are other options, foster care. Oh, I, I, uh, I can't stay here. I, I can't pay the rent. Listen, I got a thermos of coffee out in the car, let me go get it. (gentle melancholic music) (door bangs) You said, "You wouldn't put us back into foster care." You said, "We'd be together forever." Uh, honey, I'm all alone. You promised you'd keep us. You promised. You promised! (Gregory sighs) (melancholic music) I put Jeremiah in the Children's Crisis Unit. How long do you think he'll have to be there? Probably a week or so. They need to pinpoint his problems. And we need to talk about you keeping up with his medication for hyperactivity- It just- And- It made him impossible. And we need to talk about your performance agreement. Oh, God. What just like the last time I gotta do this and that before I get my children back? Parenting classes. Look there is not a thing wrong with my parenting that money wouldn't solve. Why don't they just pay me what they're giving the foster parents? Mrs. Kingsley. Look if you'd been through what I've been through, my husband abused me, okay? Surprise, surprise, I have trouble controlling my kids. Just so obvious. Okay, you'll need to see Jeremiah and Gregory at least once a week. It's gonna be very hard for you to keep connected with them. 'Cause they're not gonna believe that things are gonna work out. My boys believe in me. They know I'm doing this for their good. Zach's gonna stay with you? I gotta hold on to one of you in order to get all of you back. But he's been with you all along. He's the baby, Gregory. He can't handle it like you can. (gentle melancholic music) (Gregory sighs) So Gregory, ready to go? Aren't you gonna say goodbye to me? (Gregory sighs) Goodbye. Hey, honey, don't, don't you worry, you know? Mom's gonna come through for you. I'm doing this for you. Come here. Let me take your little face in my hands, tell you how much I love you. You broke the window. I did not. Guys, come on let's go. Did too. I did not. (group chattering) (horse neighing) You want a carrot? You want a carrot? (horse neighing) Hi. Well, at least I'm getting to know where to find you. Where everyone else isn't. Yeah. So glad school's out? I guess. Did well on those computers. I asked. Proud of you. (horse neighing) So why are you here? Oh, it's the June meeting of the County Commission on Children Services. Actually I came a little early 'cause, uh, well, I didn't wanna just call you, but I heard from your mom. Here, boy. You want this? Come on, Shawn. This is boring. Shawn, she's your mom. She lives a half hour away from here in Orlando, and she hasn't come to visit me once in eight months. That's 37 Sundays, 259 days, 6,216 hours. All right, she tried to call in April. Now she's calling in June. And she called to say, "That she's gone back to Missouri." (horse neighing) Missouri? Saint Louis. (gentle melancholic music) You, you wanna arrange a call to her? No. (horse neighing) (group chattering) (Gregory panting) (picture ripping) (Gregory grunts) (Gregory crying) Mom. Mom. (group chattering) Whoa, whoa. I liked what you said in there, George. Well, no amount of words can make up for actions. Thought you said you were a lawyer? Well, is this the rec room, which is used for just that. Don't mind us, boys, we're just some old guys having a tour. Uh, back here we've got the bedrooms. Huh. Nice and clean here, Ed. Thank you. I don't think there's anybody back here now, so why don't we have a look at one of the rooms. (door clicks) Uh. Uh, I'm sorry, son, I didn't think anybody was in here. No, that, that's okay. Yeah, but we don't wanna disturb your reading. We'll look at another room. All right. Have a nice tour. Thank you. (gentle music) (insects chirping) What's bothering you? (sighs) It's this boy. (gentle melancholic music) Oh? I saw this little boy at the Boy's Ranch, not a smile anywhere in him. My brother used to look at me like that. After Mom died Dad was drinking. George. He was so alone. You did what you could for him. You got him away from your father. Alcohol is such an evil, it never lets you go. I, I thought I'd forget him, but I can't get him out of my mind. I just can't, I can't. George. Elizabeth, can we do something? Can we do something for him? Well, of course we can, George. You call the Boy's Ranch and we'll see if there's something. George, we'll do whatever we can. Okay? (group chattering) I don't think we'll be able to get a table. I think we'll be just fine, yeah. Hello, here we are. Hi. This is Shawn. Shawn this is Mr. and Mrs. Russ. Hi. Hi, Shawn. Well, hello, Shawn. Hi. Hi. So have a good lunch. And, uh, well, I'll see ya in a couple hours, okay. Thank you, Jordan. Okay. All right. Very good. Later, dude. Thank you. Buh-bye. Bye. Well, Shawn, we picked this place because we didn't know what you'd like, but, uh, it's got really good hamburgers. Oh, that's great. Really great. I bet you like hamburgers, huh? Oh, yeah, all American kids have to like hamburgers. It's in the Constitution. (George and Elizabeth laugh) But, uh, does that mean I can't have steak? Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Russ, it's nice to see you. And uh, which little Russ are you? I can't keep the eight of you straight. This way please. Thank you. You guys have eight kids? Yeah. Must really like kids. Well, you know at first I was kind of afraid of the horses. Well, not afraid, but you know they're so big. Then I discovered that they like to have their noses scratched. (Elizabeth laughs) Well, I like to have my nose scratched occasionally too. (chuckles) There you are Mr. Russ. Thank you. And this, young man, is for you. You didn't eat your expensive steak. I forgot to be hungry. (chuckles) Shall we? (gentle music) Next time we can go to my office. Oh, yeah. Show you were I work. That'd be great. How about that? I'd like to do that sometime. You have his steak? Oh, yeah, the steak. You can eat that when you back to the ranch. Oh, do I have to go back? Don't make me go back, please? Shawn, Shawn, come on. Please. Come here, come here. Listen, if Elizabeth and I can get qualified as foster parents, would you like to come and live with us? Yeah. Oh, yeah. (George laughs) But how can you give a child security without becoming attached? It's unnatural. Well, it's foster care. You have to remember you're just a way station. A child can't thrive like that. Well, unless you wanna adopt every dependent kid in Florida. It is in the child's best interest to be reunited with his biological family. Now are you thinking about adopting Shawn? He's been in foster care for almost two years. The state is suppose to either terminate the parental rights or return the child to his parents after 18 months. George, it's not that. We fell in love with him, we wanna help. Well, Shawn's talked about nothing else but you since your lunch. (sighs) He's so needy right now. Well, he hasn't spoken to his mother in over a year. He's only been in her custody 10 months out of the last eight years. Does he wanna go back? The boy is totally impressionable right now. If you tell him you wanna adopt him he's gonna stick to you like a barnacle. He's gonna pin all his hopes on you. Foster children aren't suppose to have hopes either? He's not an orphan, George. If his mother completes the performance agreement The judge is gonna rule that the family be reunited, and Shawn won't have a choice. But if he pins his hopes on you he is gonna have a problem. Well, last thing we wanna do is hurt him. We won't mention it. They're here, they're here! Wait 'til diner. I'll open the door. This is gonna be the world's longest weekend. Chill out. Well, you don't have to give up your room. Guys, remember what Dad said. Hey, you take the olives. Take that dish to the table. Hey, fellas. Hi, Dad. Hi, dad. Hi. Hey, honey. Why don't you take this bag for Shawn. Thanks, where's Mom? How was the trip? It was good. Okay, super. All right, come on give him some air, give him some air. I thought they said you were 12? You're short. I wanna eat. We've been waiting so long. Well, well. Hey, Mom. Really missed you. Cherry coming up. How do you feel about cold cuts? Anything you make is terrific. He can't call her mom. He already did. Come on. Cherry, coming up. (group chattering) Hey, I sit next to Mommy. You know what you come sit next to me on the other side. Here, okay, move down, darling. Oh, sorry. Get in the middle. Let your brother sit here. Hey, there, Bucko. Okay, there we go. All right, Shawn? Good. Okay. Everybody hungry? All right. Dig in. Thank you very much. Great. Can you pass the mustard down, please? (group chattering) Anybody want bread? Shawn, whatever you want, whatever you see, you know there's plenty of food. There's more in the kitchen. Pass the carrots. (group chattering) Hey, black olives. You like black olives? Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's great. All the Russ kids love black olives. We even get a can in our Christmas stockings. This has got to mean something. It's a sign, it's a sign. Yeah. Oh, well, I think that it means you can adopt me. (group laughing) (knuckles tapping) (dog barking) (door clicks) (door clicks) Oh, I must have the wrong address. No, you must be the social worker Rachel said, "Was coming to do a home study." Right, I'm Marie Esteban. Who are you? James Sharp. This is my house. Rachel! Hey! Rachel. (door bangs) Hi. Hi. Come on in. Rachel, you were supposed to get departmental approval before another adult lived with you. What I'm not allowed to get married without their approval? I thought you were still married- No. To Ralph. This time I'm getting a divorce. Have a seat. This looks like a really nice place. Thanks. How are you doing on your parenting classes? A psychological evaluation on you and Zach. Rachel, aren't you worried they'll terminate your parental rights? Look, I gave my kids up so they could eat and they could have a place to sleep. It was a money thing. That was a year ago, Rachel. It's gonna get done. Don't worry. Look, I just, you know I had to get my life together, okay? How are the other boys doing? Um, I, I talk to Jeremiah every week. And the last time I called, uh, Gregory, the people at the Boy's Ranch said, "He didn't wanna talk to me," so. That doesn't concern you? He's still angry with me because I had to give him up. But he's the oldest and he's just gonna have to understand. But you know he's gonna come around. Yeah. We're going. It's a surprise. We can't tell you. Why not? It's a surprise. No, 'cause it wouldn't be a surprise. Okay. My own desk. Yeah. Wow. Try the bed. A waterbed! Wow! I love my new room. Thank you fabulous, wonderful, terrific Mother. All right, you settle in. I'm gonna get dinner, okay? (Gregory sighs) Why are you such a suck up? I'm not. My brother says, "You're the biggest suck up he's ever seen." Get out of my room. This is the guestroom. I live here now just like you do. You just got here, I was born here. (water splashing) (Gregory grunting) Dad, look at this enormous bubble I just blew. (air blowing) (group chattering) Hey, Dad, make him stop. Stop. Paper, honey. Whoa, where'd you learn to do that? You gonna show me, right, Shawn? Sure. First you have to learn to suck up a lot of air. Takes a lot of practice to be a really good suck up. (air blowing) (birds chirping) Mom? Dad? Good morning, Shawn. Well, I'm sorry, I scare yo? That's okay. Where is everybody? Well, they had to be at church to practice for the Christmas play. We thought you'd like to sleep in. Oh, okay. The, they'll be back soon. Well, sure, after lunch. Oh, okay, I just, I thought they were captured by aliens or something. That's a scary feeling. Oh, no, I didn't really think they were captured by aliens. Shawn, we live here. We're not going anywhere and neither are you, okay? Yeah. Now what do you want for breakfast? (group chattering) (phone ringing) She taking the parenting classes? Not yet. I see she has a job. Is sending in money for the support of kids? No. What about her psychological evaluation? No, she hasn't done any of that yet, but I think if we just gave Rachel a little more time. Marie, you have what? 30 cases on your desk? Maybe it's time to close out the ones who can't even be bothered to try. (phone ringing) Okay, okay. I'll, uh, get a letter out to Florida today. You do that. (phone ringing) (birds chirping) (group chattering) We only have seven glasses. I'll get on later. Okay. What now? Would you grab the napkins off the counter there? Oh, yeah, sure. Hey, Dad. Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad. The king of the world is home. Let's go. (laughs) You look like you ate a canary. (laughs) A big fat one. I heard some interesting news from the HRS. (gentle dramatic music) Missouri Social Services has recommended against the return of the two Kingsley boys to their natural mother. And HRS is staffing for termination. Oh, oh. Yes. No fair speaking legal, Dad. (George laughs) Well, if everything goes the way it should we'll be able to adopt Shawn. All right. All right. Great. That is if he wants us to. Yes. Yes. (Elizabeth laughs) (group chattering) (phone ringing) Rachel. You've got to stop him. What, who? The judge in Florida, he's scheduled a hearing. Oh, they moved to terminate your rights haven't they? What? No, they've given Ralph visitation. They're gonna give Ralph custody. Your husband? Yeah. He called me on the phone. He spent the whole day with Jeremiah. How can they give him custody? Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Come, come on in here. You're losing me here. Sit down, tell me what's going on. He's just, you know, he's gonna disappear again. He's a blackout drunk. I left him for abusing me. Gregory called 911 on him in Florida. Yeah, I know there were two abuse reports filed on him over in Boone County two years ago. That was the last time he had all three boys. Okay, I'm gonna call Florida and find out what's going on. Look, I don't know what the status of Gregory and Jeremiah is. I thought they were gonna terminate your rights. But if, if they're given Ralph a chance at custody. No. I can fax them a letter. I'll recommend the boys be returned to you. Okay. You've started the classes? Yes. Zach is doing better? Yes. Okay. Now all you have to do is show up at that hearing in Florida. Okay? Mm-hmm. Shawn, there's no easy way to say this. Your biological mother and father want you back, and the state has stopped termination proceedings. Apparently your father- No. Shawn, easy. Just, just let me tell you what's happening. I won't go. Not with him. Not with her. It's the law. We may not like it. What do you know about it? You're not going back to a father who's drunk all the time. You're not going back to sleeping in cars, and being beaten with a belt. And you're not gonna get sent off to wherever your mom can dump you when she's doesn't want you anymore. You're not gonna watch her throw up all over your breakfast. That's not gonna happen to you. Shawn. I'm not going back. If the judge says- What about what I say? Why don't I count? Doesn't anybody care what I want? I do, Shawn. So does the Constitution, the way I read it. And according to the Constitution you're a person. You have rights. You have the right to be secure in your home. You have the right to protect yourself. And you have the right too pursue happiness. And that means that you have the right to your own lawyer, so you can go into court and present your case. So you could do it. You could be my lawyer. No, no, Shawn, I can't. HRS would consider that a conflict of interest. They'd try to take you away from us. No one's gonna help me? Yeah, come on over here. (George sighs) Now you're gonna have to make this call by yourself. You're gonna have to go to this meeting by yourself. You're on your own here. Jerri Blair. Is that a guy? Now why are you here, Gregory Kingsley? That's your real name. The name your parents gave you. It's about the only thing they gave me. What was so bad? Tell me. Nothing every stayed the same, nothing. When I was with my dad we moved so much I missed a year of school. And when I was with my mom, if she left I never knew if she was gonna come back. Did they starve you, or lock you in a closet, or burn you with cigarettes? They just didn't care about me. You wanna go to court, and get up on the witness stand and say, my mom's a bad person, my daddy's a drunk, take away their rights? Maybe if I do it people will pay attention to the kids getting burnt with cigarettes. But it's not a game. If you get what you want and Rachel wins the lottery the next day she doesn't have to give you a dime. What's that got to do with it? I just want you to understand what's going on. We're going to court to ask the judge to take away parents' legal rights over me. Well, court is the last place we wanna go. First we see if your lawyer can, uh, get the system to work for you. How much does my lawyer cost? I don't know. Got any decent baseball cards? (traffic humming) (birds chirping) (scoffs) She abandoned him in Missouri. She gave him up in Florida twice. In all this time did you ever make any contributions to child support? Oh, hell, you gotta find Rachel before you can pay her. He hasn't paid a penny in child support, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Kingsley. Well, it seems Ms. Esteban has changed her mind about your progress with the performance agreement, Mrs. Kingsley. And since you've been the primary care giver to Jeremiah since he was born, I'm going to award custody of him to you. Now let's him settle in and we'll, we'll judicate Gregory's case in six months. That'll be September. What about me? What about my rights? Before I would consider your rights, Mr. Kingsley, I would need to see a full alcohol evaluation in writing. (door clicks) (door bangs) Who does he think he is? He probably could smell you from up there. Don't you know enough not to come into court reeking of booze. That judge screwed me. I'm gonna sue. I'm gonna sue you all! (door clicks) I'm so happy. Rachel. Isn't it wonderful? Yeah, I'm happy for you. Thanks. I'm very happy for Jeremiah. He never stops talking about you. Oh. But, uh, listen about Gregory, uh, well, his foster parents would like to meet you. And I wanna meet them. Well, good. I'll arrange it. Thanks. Okay. Hello. I'm so glad to be able to thank you. Jordan tells me Gregory is very happy. We love Shawn. That is the damnedest thing. I almost named that boy Shawn, and then he goes and picks it himself. (chuckles) Mrs. Kingsley- Uh, let me start, George. Rachel, you know how Gregory's been- Angry with me, won't talk to me, oh, yeah. Yeah, and he wants to be adopted, and he wants the moon. He's, he's gonna get over it, you know. Well, the Russ's feel that his desire to be adopted is genuine. (laughs) Well, then they obviously don't know children. I mean he's just- Rachel. They would like to adopt him if you'd be willing to sign. What, what? Come on, you've been gone. I don't think you realize the changes that Gregory's been through. He changes his name and he changes his mother just like that, I don't think so. Mrs. Kingsley, Shawn has said repeatedly, "That he'd rather go back to the Boy's Ranch than return home to you." He is my son, and he is gonna go where I tell him to go. I gave birth to him. You know when he was born he was three pounds, I went to that hospital every day until they took him out of the incubator. Who are you? Where have you been all of his life, huh? (door clicks) (door bangs) (traffic humming) (insects chirping) (knuckles tapping) What? What? Ralph, it's me. I gotta talk to you. (door clicks) Those people wanna adopt him. Who, what people? Gregory's foster parents. State's paid him money to take care of him, now they wanna steal him. Have you, have you been with him? Have you seen him? No, they said, "He doesn't wanna see me." That's what they told me. They want him. Of course they want Gregory. They want, they, they, why else would they put off the case today? They're trying to keep him from me. They're telling him things. If I could just talk to him. They think they can walk all over us 'cause we're poor. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go behind the scenes. I got that judge's ear. Yeah, all I'd have to do is just take his little face in my hands and just tell him how much I love him, that's all I have to do. We gotta get a visitation. We gotta see him face-to-face. We're gonna do whatever we have to do to get Gregory back. Jordan told me, "Ralph has called the Boy's Ranch seven times in the last hour." He's out of control. Why is Shawn crying? You go to bed. Daddy'll take care of it. But there's a squad car outside. I know, honey. It's just to make sure that nothing happens. Everything's gonna be okay. All right, trust us. Go. (phone clicking) (phone ringing) Yeah. Hello, Mr. Kingsley. Hello. George Russ. I just got your message. Listen, mister, we wanna see our son. Mr. Kingsley- Yeah, well, who do you think you are keeping him from us? Well- We're gonna see him! You bring him to the Boy's Ranch tomorrow. He's our son! You beggar! You thief! You self-righteous pig! Mr. Kingsley- We're gonna see him! You bring him to the Boy's Ranch tomorrow. Well, we'd be- He's our son! Happy to arrange a visitation- You beggar! Sometime tomorrow. You thief! You self-righteous- Afternoon. Pig! We trusted you! You know, you're, you're not suppose to be the parent! You're the foster parents! We're the parents! Can you get that straight in your head? Tomorrow then? 5:30. You beggar! You thief! (gentle melancholic music) (phone thuds) Who are these people? Please don't make me go see them. Shawn, we have no choice. I really don't want to. (crying) Nothing's gonna happen. But something might if we fight it. So please just obey me on this, okay? Okay, Dad. All right. (insects chirping) Where are they? (phone ringing) (phone clicks) Lake County Boy's Ranch. Uh-huh. Hang on. (sighs) Hello. Hi, Rachel. Hi, Ralph. No, I don't. No, I don't. Could you please just? (sighs) No! No, you listen! I don't wanna live with you. I don't wanna live with anybody but the Russ's because I love them. And I want them to adopt me. No. No, you can't. Hello? (George sighs) They're gonna get me. They're cowards, and they're bullies, and they're not gonna lay a hand on you. (group chattering) (keys clicking) (phone ringing) Gregory K., plaintiff. Wait, uh, who is that the guardian? No, he's a kid. Can a minor file a complaint? Well, we're gonna find out. Gregory K., a minor child plaintiff versus Ralph K., his natural father, Rachel K., his natural mother, and the State of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services for terminating of the child/parent relationship. What an idea. Child suing to get rid of his parents. Ms. Blair, you are a caution. If your petition is accepted you may be the first kid in America to bring suit on your behalf to terminate your parents' rights. So they'll have to pay attention to me now. That's right. So we have to be careful they can't say stuff about us, like George and Elizabeth are keeping you from your natural parents. You're gonna have to see Ralph and Rachel again. (Gregory sighs) You're gonna get a childhood, Shawn. You're just gonna have to wait a couple more months for it to begin. Take a shot, come on, come on. Take a shot, come on, come on. Ready to pass. Come on. Oh, he's a star! (ball thudding) Oh. Great shot- All right. Shawn. Good shot. (ball thudding) My boys playing ball. My boy, I can't believe it. Come on. Oh! We, we never. Yeah, come on. Why, I, I can't give him what you can. Oh. And I want my boy happy. I want him settled. Good shot! (ball thudding) So I'm ready. Ready for pass. I'll sign the adoption papers. I'll sign 'em today. I'd sign 'em right now if you had 'em. As a matter of fact I do. (ball thudding) Oh, wait. (laughs) Whoo! (hands clapping) Try to get by me, come on. Oh! (ball thudding) Come on! You, you. (ball thudding) Well, I, uh, I, I don't have a pen. (ball thudding) Let's see if this one works. (Gregory grunts) (ball thudding) Yeah, come on. Do it again. Take a shot. (grunts) Yeah! All right. All right. Whoo-hoo! All right. The man! Okay, let's try that again. Okay. If you file to adopt Gregory now you're, you're backing the State of Florida into a corner. Good. The HRS has abandoned Shawn just as surely as Rachel has. They've kept him in foster care for almost three years illegally. They have reports that Ralph is abusive, and that Rachel neglects her children. Judge Kirk recommended terminating her rights and they ignored him. They staffed for adoption last January, and they, they got his hopes up. They got our hopes up. And then they turn around and they say, "Give her another chance." It's abuse by a state agency. They will come and take him away. We'll get Kirk to run the cases in tandem and get the decisions on both at once. And what about Shawn? That's what this is about. He's never had a grownup stand up for him. He needs to know that he's not alone. If you lose you won't be able to go back to foster parenting. You are deliberately breaking your agreement with the state. (sighs) Shawn can't go back. Neither can we. Okay, Gregory, uh, oh, here. We're all here just like you wanted. I still don't wanna see her. Gregory. Gregory. Look at you. So you seen any good movies lately? What? What kind of movies do you like? What do you mean? I mean what kind of movies do you like? I don't know. Did you have a nice vacation? What? Didn't you, didn't you go on vacation down to a condo on the beach? Oh, yeah. It was nice. Wish I could take you to the beach. Wait 'til you see our new home. Jim's fixing up the bedroom for you in the basement. I brought some pictures. See. (gentle melancholic music) Here's you and your brothers. (Gregory sighs) You know your little brothers really miss you. Maybe you could give 'em a call sometime. (Gregory sighs) Maybe later. Gregory, it's just a phone call. What's a phone call, huh? Look, it's so crowded in here, maybe we should go take a little walk, huh? Uh. (clears throat) Can we, can we do that, just a little walk? Well, I. No. Uh, we really need to try to get to know each other if we're gonna be a family again, Gregory. Honey, I need to get to know you. Honey, come here. Honey, you need to try. Gregory. (birds chirping) Judge Thomas Kirk, Orange County Juvenile Court. All rise. (gavel bangs) Well, Gregory, it is the opinion of this court that you have the same constitutional rights as an adult. I'm going to award you standing. You can bring your own case. (gavel bangs) Okay, Shawn, let's go. Gregory, Gregory. It's okay. (group chattering) Never would have believed this. Me neither. Okay. You gonna be okay under here? Yeah, I guess. Keep it closed. Okay. Let's go. What did the judge have to say inside the courtroom? (group chattering) Judge Kirk has given Gregory K. the right to come into a court of law and present his own case. Is the boy happy? Children are people not property, and they deserve to be treated as people in the Florida courts. Their voices need to be heard. Gregory, are you happy? Are you happy, Gregory? I've changed my mind, I don't want the adoption. I thought I was gonna have the right to see Gregory, and now I understand I may never see him again. I sent him $20 for his birthday, they never even sent a thank you note. Don't have to yell. I didn't start this, you started it. Oh, what are pulling? What? I didn't start. You try to live like that! Yeah, set an example! Don't start! Oh, come on, every day! Happens all the time, and the next time. You do this every time! (Jim yelling) Every time you do this! Rotten! Why can't you just, don't you start with my kids! Don't you start with my kids! No, I have to. I have to, 'cause you set an example! I did not! The example is not! You are no example! It's not! You don't even have job! I, they need an example! Can't even keep a job! And I'm gonna give it to 'em! Don't you, don't you- And you can't make 'em! Don't you- You can't make 'em! (Jim and Rachel yelling) I, I can't stand it! 911. 911, my stepdad just pushed my mom down the stairs, and she's bleeding all over. Come here! Is he hurting her? Yes, he beating up on her. Do you need an ambulance? I don't know, but I've gotta get off quick. (recorder clicks) (phone ringing) (George sighs) Poor Jeremiah and Zachary. Still do you know how many kids have courage to do that? He even called back to make sure they were coming. Well, maybe their big brother Gregory is having some affect on them. Well, if we use this to prove Rachel's unfit that makes Ralph next in line as biological parent. That will never happen. We have one, two physical abuse reports on Ralph from Missouri. A Florida police report. And then there's Colorado. (folder thuds) His teenage daughter. Did you know that Ralph had a daughter from a previous marriage? He was married for the first time when he was 14. And according to a Missouri case worker there were some allegations that he abused his daughter. (Jerri sighs) Well, I bet he would hate to see some of this get brought up in court. I mean if we don't bring 'em up Rachel's lawyer will. I wonder if, uh, Ralph would be interested in a little bargaining. Ralph, as your court appointed attorney I have advised you of the affect it might have should you withdraw your consent for the adoption of Gregory Kingsley. Yes. And you've decided it would be in the best interest of Gregory to now consent to his adoption? Uh, at this time as far as I'm capable of that's the truth. You will never be compelled to give a sworn statement or to appear at trial because of the fact that you are now consenting to his adoption. Is that your understanding? As far as I understand the truth, I believe I do understand it. I do understand. (recorder clicks) (birds chirping) Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Never have to see you again, Ralph! Never. What am I doing something wrong? No. I don't have to. I'm not gonna. Shawn, my, my father was an alcoholic. My little brother was about your age when I took him away from him. So you know? Yeah, I know. I know where your strength comes from, and I know the price you paid for it. I also know this same bitter anger that saved me nearly ate me alive later on. (sighs) So you're saying I'll never get away? Not until you forgive him. (Gregory sighs) No, no way, no way. Not today, Shawn. Someday. He's just weak, Shawn. They both are. (sighs) Okay. But not today. No. (water splashing) (water splashing) (car door clicks) (group chattering) (car door bangs) Does Gregory wanna see you? Isn't it true, Mr. Sharp has a history of abuse? Did he push you down the stairs? Of course he wouldn't push me down the stairs, I fell. I have cerebral palsy and I fell. This is a case about class. If the judge allows this adoption then rich people don't have to go to Romania to get their babies. They can go to the local hospital and get a poor woman's child. (camera snapping) (group chattering) Sure you wanna call Rachel as your first witness? We get her to commit herself on these issues and then we start the parade. She won't have a shred of credibility left when they begin their case. If it works you'll look like a genius. And if it doesn't I'm gonna look like a jerk on "Court Television". Judge Thomas Kirk, Orange County Juvenile Court. All rise. You had a severe drinking problem did you not? No. You spent most of your money on alcohol and drugs didn't you? No. During the period that Gregory was in foster care you never sent him a letter. Incorrect. Did you ever call and talk to him on the phone? I was not allowed to. What happened on the night of August 28, 1992? I went downstairs to turn off the lights and I fell down the stairs. Do you know that Jeremiah Kingsley told the police, "That Jim Sharp did it,"? Yes, I do. And that Mr. Sharp admitted he beat you. Is he lying too? (group chattering) Now Mrs. Kingsley, during the second period you placed Gregory and Jeremiah in foster care, why didn't you attend parenting classes? I had no car, no way to get there. I was usually at work. I had to work to survive, 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week. And yet you maintained contact with Jeremiah. Telephonic contact. Yes, I talked to him every two weeks on average. When did you try to contact Gregory? June of '91. But they said, "He was nervous about talking to me." Uh, I tried to call him on his birthday but he was away on camping trip. Were you ever discouraged by the Boy's Ranch in trying to communicate with Gregory? They said, "That he didn't wanna be with me after a while." First he did and then he didn't. Now, Mrs. Kingsley, when you entered into your performance agreement was it your understanding you were giving up your child for permanent placement with the department? Absolutely not. I was told, "That if I worked hard and I completed my performance agreement my children would be returned to me." Anything they asked of me I was willing to do and I did. (group chattering) Okay, Mrs. Kingsley, you're excused. Let's take a 20 minute break while the other witnesses are prepared. (gavel bangs) (group chattering) Gregory. Okay, kids, excuse me. Shawn, let's go. They won't even let me near him. I know. I told you. Mrs. Kingsley, I'm not trying to take your child away. (scoffs) Then what exactly would you call it? Did you try to help Rachel? I picked up Rachel, I drove her to work, I dropped off her kids. I took her to HRS. I took her grocery shopping. But there's only so much you can do. And what else did she do? She got fired for scamming of her tabs. Did you try to help her out financially? We knew better then to give her money 'cause she was spending what she did have on drinking. I don't, uh, remember what Gregory had done, but uh, she, she smacked him upside the head. She really like the face and the head. (group chattering) Nothing is gonna change, you know? She's just not gonna change. Your witness. Now Ms. Hansen, you are somehow related to Rachel Kingsley. Uh, she was my stepsister. And after our parents got divorced I married her brother and I was her sister-in-law. And you saw all these things? Drugs? Neglect? Abuse? You were worried for the children? Yes. Did you ever call the police? Did you ever call the state authorities? Did you ever call social workers? I didn't wanna get involved. But you've involved yourself today? Hold on, wait a minute. Your wife just left the room, would you like a little recess? You can see how she is. Uh, yes. Thank you. Liz. Liz, are you all right? I can't. It's just the anxiety. No, can't testify. Sure you can. Sure you can. You just get up on the stand, everything will be fine. No, George. (Elizabeth panting) I won't testify. Liz. Liz. What are we doing to this woman? Why do we have to be so hard on her? And she sitting in there listening to all of this. Hey. It's a divorce. He only has six years left to be a child. He can't wait. George, I'm a mother, I know how she feels. Shawn is just a possession to her. (gentle melancholic music) Mom, are you okay? Oh, sure, honey. I, I'm, I'm just, uh, worrying. About what? About Rachel. Don't. That's how she gets what she wants. I know, but she wants to do right. She always wants to. She always means to. She always promises to. But she never does. Shawn, she's your mother. That's how I know. (gentle music) (door clicks) Mrs. Russ, you're a mother. Does Rachel Kingsley love her children? Yes, I think Rachel loves her children, but she can't show it because no one's ever shown it to her. She had no mother to watch to see how to be a good mother and put that love into action. What do you mean by put that love into action? You've got to put the child first. Her baby Zachary called 911 and said, "That her boyfriend was beating her up." And it is so obvious from the police records and all that that really happened. But she goes on television and says, "That Zachary is lying." How can she do that to her own child? He's just a little boy. (George sighs) (insects chirping) (knuckles tapping) Shawn. (knuckles tapping) Shawn, can I come in? (door clicks) Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, I just can't sleep. Me neither. What are you gonna do if the judge sends you back to your mother? Be so mean and bad they'll send me away. But suppose they don't? Suppose they just keep you. Will you come home? You're part of us now. (Gregory sighs) That's how I feel. I'm scared. It's gonna be all right. You see, it'll turn out all right. Does Gregory fit into your family? As if he was one of my natural born children. Do you love this child? I do. If Gregory Kingsley came to you today and said that he had changed his mind and wanted to be reunited with his mother, what would you do? It would break my heart, but I would do whatever he wanted me to do. Thank you, Mr. Russ. Your Honor, we would like to call Gregory Kingsley. (group chattering) Sit down, Gregory, and move up close to the microphone so we can hear you. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Uh-huh. State your name, please. Gregory Kingsley. And do you understand the difference between a truth and a lie. Yes. And do you understand as you sit up there that you have sworn to tell the truth? That that is what you've promised to do and what you will do. Yes. Do you trust your mom? No. Why not? 'Cause she breaks promises. What did she promise you? She promised that she'd never put me in foster care again. Do you love Rachel as a mother? No. What about your brothers Jeremiah and Zachary, how do you feel about them? About the same as my mom. I don't love her like a mom. Do you hate her? No. Do you feel sympathy for her? Yeah. After the litigation started your mom sent you some letters didn't she? Yeah, she kept bugging me to come home. And she tried to make me feel sorry for what I was doing. She tried to blame you for what has happened? Yes. Do you feel you've done anything wrong? No. Are you doing this because you want to hurt her? No. Why are you doing this? I'm doing it for me, so I can be happy. (group chattering) Thank you, Gregory. Now Gregory, you've testified in your deposition that the reason you thought your mother put you in foster care was she didn't have enough money. That was a guess I had. We never really had any money. Sometimes we didn't have enough food. And how did you feel about that? Would you have preferred to stay with your mother and not have food? Yeah. You're saying you cared so much about your mother that even if she couldn't take care of you financially you wanted to be with her more than anything? Yeah. But you don't feel that way today. (Gregory sighs) No. No further questions. (gentle melancholic music) You may go back to your seat now, Gregory. (door clicks) Your Honor, Rachel is pleading for our sympathy. I have sympathy for her. I have compassion for her. I have even cried for her on occasion. But we cannot allow ourselves to put Gregory's life on hold while she tries to get hers together. This young man has found a family that wants him, loves him, and in fact needs him. Because we can't do without him now. I plead with the court to allow Gregory to have a successful and happy life. (group chattering) Rachel Kingsley loves her child. No one said she didn't. But no one sat this little boy down and told him what it's like to be poor in America today. This child has decided it is in his best interest not to be poor anymore. We cannot pick and choose who our parents are. If this is the case then there will be plenty of kids running around trying to find new parents. (group chattering) (gentle melancholic music) Well, it's been a very long trial. I don't see Mrs. Kingsley here. She became ill, Judge. I thought perhaps it was difficult for her to sit through this. It seems that Rachel is doing much better than she has in the past and I commend her for that. But I do believe that James Sharp caused her to fall down those stairs and she hasn't told the truth about that. I believe she's lied consistently in this court. I believe that by clear and convincing evidence almost beyond a responsible doubt that this child has been abandoned and neglected by Rachel Kingsley his mother. And it is in his manifest best interest that her parental rights be terminated immediately. Gregory, you are the son of Mr. and Mrs. Russ at this moment. (upbeat music) (group cheering) (group chattering) (gentle music) Want a few more? More. Yeah, some more? Little. Huh? Little. Some more, keep going? Keep it coming, keep it coming. There we go. (laughs) There you go. Here you go. Pass 'em down. Oh, I get some this time. (group chattering) Oh, hey, who's throwing hot olives at me? (group chattering) Here, coming up. All right, honey, you want that? Yeah. No. Just a minute. (group chattering) There and a little piece for the queen. (gentle guitar music) (gentle dramatic guitar music)
