Make Buzz turn off the music. - && [ Pop ] - No problem. - Mom! - " Mom." - Hang on, Viv. - Let your sister rehearse. - Like that'll help. - And clean up the kitchen. - But-- Now. Okay, Viv. I'll seeyou in a bit. I thought I told you to clean up the kitchen. - I did. Can I go to the movies tonight with friends? - No. - No-- - No, no. I'm showing a house. I need you to baby-sit Kevin. - Why can't Megan do it? - She has to go to rehearsal. - You don't have to go to the movies. - I do if I want a life. You're baby-sitting Kevin. Where is he, anyway? Kevin. - What is it? What is it? - [ Boy] A car! - Whoa! - [ Man ] Wait a second. That was-- Honey, that was mine. [Buzz On TV] Awesome.

Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Very funny, Buzz. [ Mom Laughing On TV ] - Last Christmas, huh? - Yeah. This Christmas isn't gonna be any fun. Of course it will. Honey, we're gonna do all the same things we've always done. Sing Christmas carols, be with family and friends... put cookies and milk out for Santa. - It's gonna be just the same. - Except this year... no Dad. Right. That's the one thing that's different. Why can't you just get back together? [ Sighs ] Honey, we're just gonna have to let that go. - [ Chattering On TV] - That's a no, right? It means some things are just out of our control. I know you miss your dad. And he loves me very much. You both do, and it has nothing to do with me. - Did he tell you that? - I'm nineyears old. I watch a lot ofTV. Did he leave because of me? No. Of course not. - I knew it. It was Buzz and Megan. - [ Chuckles ] Oh, it wasn't anyone... or any one thing. Then what was it? That's not easy to explain. But, uh, sometimes when... people are married for a long time, they get into kind of a rut. - You know what a rut is? - Yeah. Like, when people aren't having any fun... and they're really bored. Kind oflike that. Now, will you come downstairs? When you're ready. [ Chattering On TV] - Hey! - [ Clapping ] Wait a second. - [Megan ] Kevin, come in here. - [Buzz] Hurry,you've gotta see this! [ Groans ] Ow! Hey! Hey! - You always fall for that. - Let me up, zit-face! - Lamebrain. When are you gonna learn? - Get offyour brother. - Andshouldn't you be rehearsing? - [Kevin Grunting] - How are you getting to the teen center? - Ashley's mom's picking me up. - [ Grunting Continues ] - Can I please go to the movies? No. I told you. You're watching Kevin. - Please let him go. I'll stay home alone. - No. - [ Scoffs ] I've done it before. - Don't remind me. You loused up mywhole night. And ifI'm gonna be miserable, you're gonna be miserable. - Mom! - [DoorOpens ] - [Man ] Hello. It's me. - Dad! - Dad! - Hey, bigguy. - [ Growls Playfully] - I didn't know you were coming tonight. - Oh, I thought I'd surprise you. - Hey, Dad. Hey, Buzz. Oh, Kate. Gosh, the place looks great. Really nice decorations. - Same as everyyear. - [Kevin ]So, um... Dad, why'd you come tonight? Actually, I want to talk to your mom about something. Privately. - Do you think he wants to come home? - Aw, Kev. [ Huffs ] - What? - No " Hello, how are ya?" Sorry. I have a business appointment, Peter. What do you want? Okay, gosh. I wasn't gonna jump right into it, but-- Well, you know Natalie and I are living together, and, uh... well, when our divorce is final, I'm gonna marry her. Really? You're getting married again. Wow. That's, uh-- That-- [ Exhales ] Wow. We've only been separated eight months. Yeah, I-- It just happened real quickly, and-- Listen, Kate... I reallywant the kids to spend a little time with me overthe holidays. You want the kids for Christmas? J ust a couple of days. I want them to get to know Natalie better. Oh, because she's gonna be their, uh, stepmother. Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to ask them. I know. - How am I supposed to see my friends? - It's only a few days. Well, duh, but that's just long enough for me to fall out ofthe loop. - Yeah, you can't expect us to give up ourvacation. - Well, Kevin? There's a royal family coming to visit. Theyhave a son aroundyour age. You might have a chance to play with a crown prince. - A crown pri nce? - Wouldn't that be cool? - Yeah, way cool. - And you guys wouldn't believe the room... that Natalie has set up foryou. What do you say? - I think I'm gonna pass. - [ Exhales ] It just wouldn't be right leaving the family at Christmas. - I'm sureyou understand. - Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, it's-- it's an open invitation, hmm? And I won't be back too late. Sinceyou're staying home, it wouldn't hurt to do some ofyour chores. Yes, ma'am. I'll make sure they get done. Clean it, cheese-face. Ow! Oops. My fault. Hello, I'm home. Hey. - How'd it go? - Awful. I hate Buzz. I neverwant to be stuck home alone with him as long as I live. Oh, honey. I know he picks on you. Picks on me? Humiliates me, tortures me. I'm sick ofbeing everyone's favoritejoke around here. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to be the youngest. Well, I hate Buzz. I wish I didn't have a brother or a sister. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do! I wish I was an only child! Well, I'm sorry that you're so unhappy. Maybeyou should go toyour room and think about whatyou have, rather than whatyou don't have. [ Scoffs ] [ Sighs ] Only children don't know how good they have it. Life would be perfect if Buzz and Megan weren't around. I mean, is it too much to ask for a familywho actually likes me? [ Sighs ] I'd run away. Ifl knew where to run to. Hey, I do! I have an open invitation. [ CoinsJingling] [Peter] Can't get myseat belt unfastened. [ Woman Laughs ] [Peter] Thanks, Alan. Thanks. Oh, what an incredible evening. And not a bad night's work. We raised over two million for those children's charities. Door, open. And I am on the verge ofsigning two ofthe biggest clients in Chicago. That's because you're the best publicist in the world. - Doors, close. - Have I remembered to thankyou for telling everyone that? Fire, light. Not tonightyou haven't. Perhaps I ought to showmyappreciation. - Music, on. - && [ Classical Starts ] - Curtains, close. - [ Chuckles ] Aw, nuts.Just when things were getting good. - Nice house, huh, pumpkin? - Sure is, Marv. You sure you don't wanna rob it? No. No, I don't wanna rob it. My robbery days are over. Darling, we're moving up to the big money. All right? The easymoney. No middleman. Pure profit. Strictly a class operation, huh? Three words, Vera. Kid-- na-- pping. I think that's only one word. We're gonna wait for the royals to arrive-- hup, dup, dodey-do-- and then we're gonna kidnap the prince. [ High-pitched Voice ] "Oh, don't kidnap me. I'm fancy." You sure we can pull it off? I mean, without Harry making the plans? Lookwhere Harry's plans kept landing me, huh? In jail. Well, not this time. Because this time... I'm the boss. - [ Scoffs ] - Who's the boss? - You're the boss. - I love being married. Eh? - That's my girl. - Hey! Oh! Looks like they got a visitor. This where you want to go? - Yeah, this is the place. Thankyou very much. - [ CoinsJingling] Keep the change. It's all change. [Snoring] [Beep ] [ Sighs ] Who are you? [ Gulps ] [Man On Speaker] Begyourpardon, ma'am. Yes, Prescott? Mr. McCallisterhas a visitor. The young man claims to be his son. Well, send him in. - Kevin! - Dad! Hey! Oh! I thought you said weren't coming. Well, I started thinking, hey, it's not fair if Mom gets all the kids for Christmas. - [ Chuckling ] - What's Christmas without kids, right? Right. Hello, Kevin. Hi, Natalie. I hope you don't mind me just dropping in like this... but my dad did invite me. - Yes, I know. - Is the invitation still open? Ofcourse it is. Molly, wouldyou come here, please? I've been looking forward to spending time with you. Your dad talks about you kids a lot. Buzz is the troublemaker. I'm the adorable one. Oh. Ah, Molly. This is Kevin McCallister, and he's going to be staying with us for a few days. Would you make up the special guest room? Ah, the special guest room. Right away, ma'am. - Oh, and Prescott, give Kevin a house key. - Ifyou say so, ma' am. What kind ofkey is this? It's a key to the whole house. This is a smart house, Kevin. It does whateveryou tell it to. Fire, out. Curtains, open. Wow! I think I'm gonna like it here. Go ahead. You try. Door, open. Wow! This stuff is so cool. Oh, mygosh! Oh, mygosh! This is such cool stuff!. Ah! Oh! Look at this game! This chair's a remote control chair! Oh! Oh,yeah! This is so cool! Oh! - Thinkyou'll be comfortable here? - I'll say! Thanks, Natalie. This is gonna be the best Christmas ever! Lights out, Kev. Hey, Kevin? Kevin. How many times can I lose this child? - Kevin. - [ Cell Phone Rings ] - Hello. - [ Peter] Kate, I... wanted to let you know Kevin just got here. Oh, thank God... he got there... safely. - I was gonna call you, but uh-- - Are you okay? Yeah. Yes, I'm fine. Well, thanks for letting him come. - Well, thanks for calling. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [Molly's Voice ] Goodmornin', Kevin. Good morning. - Who's there? - Overhere, dear. Hey. Hi. Breakfast time. Anything special you'd like? Anything? Anything. - Wow! - Sometimes I can't wait for Santa to come... so I end up doing some shopping bymyself. - Would you like to open one? - No, you're gonna spoil him. Dad, it's her house. If she wants to spoil me, she can spoil me. All right. All right. But just one. And not... the biggest one. Does it really fly? It really does, but only outside. - [Natalie ] We don't want to break anything. - Wow! Thanks, Natalie! Why do you have to leave? It's so close to Christmas. I know, but the royal family's coming for one of Natalie's fund-raisers... and it's myjob to make sure the event's well-covered by press and photographers. Hey, it's not gonna take that long, and I won't have to work for the rest ofyourvacation. And ifyou need anything, ask Prescott. He'll take care ofyou. It's a cool plane, huh? I think she's trying to buy my affection. - [ Chuckles ] Kevin. - What? I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm glad you're here. [Engine Starts ] Mr. Prescott, can I askyou a question? - Yes. - Can you make a milk shake? Do you have chocolate? What? Natalie said anything I need. - And you need a milk shake, do you? - A chocolate one. - Doyou thinkwe'll have a white Christmas? - It seems highly unlikely... given the recent unseasonable temperatures. What's this thing? A mini elevator? It's called a dumbwaiter. - Why is it called a waiter? - Because it carries food. - Why is it called dumb? - Because it doesn't speak... or ask countless idiotic questions. [Machine Whirring] - Can you read? - [ Gasps ] The door. " No Entry." - What, does that mean me? - Especiallyyou. This is the control center from which I manage this entire household... as well as my personal quarters. Miss Natalie may have granted you run ofher home... but this is my domain and strictly off-limits. Understood? Any more questions? Good. && [Humming] Hey, Molly. Whatcha doing? Cleanin' the house. - Gross. - Oh, no, no. Not in this house. Watch. Vacuum, on. - Vacuum, off. - Wow! The place even cleans itself!. Want to see somethin' really cool? Open sesame. Wow! This place is awesome. [ Chuckles ] Yes, it is. - &&[Soul, Man Singing] - [ Lip-synching ] - [ Thud] - [Prescott Groans ] Music, off? - Music, off. - && [ Fades, Ends ] I'm offto the store. I'll be back in an hour or so. And don't pick on that dear child. Door, open. [ Marv] She's out ofthe house. All right. The coast is clear. - Let's go. - Wait. Are you sure it's safe? Pumpkin, would I take you in there if it wasn't safe? It's just ifthe prince don't arrive till tomorrow, why are we going in there now? To get the lay ofthe land. What doya think, Vera... we're just gonna go in there tomorrow and start grabbing kids? "Ooh, everybody get in the van." No. We gotta figure out the where, the when, the how to get him out ofthere. Doyou know the secret to criminalsuccess? Not getting caught. Planning. Preparation. Preparedness. Be Prepared. Be a prepared " preperator." Eh? That's mymotto, and that's whyI'm-- - A Boy Scout. - No. The boss, eh? - Who's the boss? - You're the boss! - Where's the boss? - Right here. - Hey. Boss, party of one. - Right there. All right. Let's go, pookie. No. It can't be! It is! It's Marv! Mr. Prescott? Mr. Prescott, are you there? Mr. Prescott! Help! [ Gasps ] Marv, the alarm is on. Oh, no. What are we gonna do? Watch this, eh? Oh. - Alarm, off. - [ Beeps ] - Hmm. - Door, open. [Buzz] - Ahh! - That is one handy gadget. Well, what's my motto? You're the boss? - Be Prepared. Yeah. - Right. I married a genius. What doyou think that is? Is that a turkeyball? -Just put that down. Like a klepto here. - All right. - The prince should be staying in one of these rooms. - I think that's an elevator. - Don't-- You give me such a headache. - You give me a headache. - You're giving me a headache. - You give me a headache. - [Marv] Don't push me. - Door, close. - [ Whispering ] You're driving me crazy. - You're driving me crazy. - You're driving me-- - Oh, shut up. Door, open. - Door, close. - I love this thing. Marv-- The doorwas... shutting. What's wrong with this thing? Door, open. [Marv Whispering] I think there's somebodyhere. Anybody in here? - Well, not now. Shh! - You shh! - You shh! - You shh! [ Water Running] Maybe the prince came early. [ Water Running] - [ Raspberry ] - [Marv] What the-- [ Both Screaming ] [ Groans ] That's it. Come on. [ Groans ] Ow! [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] [WaterRushing] - [ Gasping ] - Up! - [Marv] Come on, honey. - Uh! Marv! - [ Creaking ] - [ Vera Gasping ] [ Screaming ] [Marv] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! [ Vera Gasping ] Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! - You! - Hello, Marv. Well, long time, no see. - Huh, kid? - Is that the prince? No, that's Kevin. Kevin, Vera. Vera, Kevin. If that ain't him, let's get outta here before somebody sees us. Yeah. I thinkwe got the lay ofthe land. I'll be back! [ Yells ] - Come on! - Oh, all right! [ Tires Squealing ] - House, clean yourself up. - [ Buzzes ] Well, it was worth a try. Okay, maybe theywon't be too mad. I mean, once I tell them what happened, maybe they'll be okaywith it. [ Screams ] - Or maybe not. - What-- What-- What-- What-- - [ Creaking ] - What-- What-- Okay, I know it looks bad, but-- - [ Screams ] - Honey, what's the-- - [ Panting ] - Kevin, what-- what-- what have you done? Prescott! Prescott! - It's not working. I tried. - [Prescott] Yes, ma'am? Get up here! Now! - Well, it wasn't working. - Kevin, what happened? It wasn't me. It was the burglars. - The burglars? - Yeah. And I recognized the one guy. Marv. Did I evertellyou about him? That's anotherstory. But the point is theywere gonna rip offyour house. -So you chose instead to trash it? -No. I was trying to protect it. - By trashing it? - What in the name of-- Hey, why didn't you come when I was calling you? Prescott... wereyou aware of anyburglars here today? Burglars? No, ma'am. All the alarms were on as usual. Maybe they turned 'em off. They had one of these, you know. I saw no intruders, and except for-- beg your pardon, ma'am-- the briefest ofbathroom breaks, my eyes were on the monitors at all times. How one child could do so much damage in the time it took me to-- - Well, it's quite beyond me. - It wasn't me! Well, there was no one else here. - He's lying! - Am not! - Are too! - Am not! - Are too! - With all due respect, sir... I didsee MasterKevin playing with the devices... - as ifthe house were a big toy. - [ Gasps ] The only hooligan here today was your son. - [ Hyperventilating ] - Give us a minute. [Hyperventilating Continues ] Kevin. [Hyperventilating Continues ] - Kevin, sit. - Dad-- - What's going on? - I told you. The burglars broke into the house. Kevin, you know I can forgive just about anything but lying. Oh, right. So you wouldn't get mad if I wrecked the place, which I didn't... as long as I admit that I did... which I didn't? Well, I thought this over and, uh... I understand that this is a difficult adjustment foryou. It's onlynatural thatyou'dbe acting out. It's a need forattention. - No, it isn't. - Kevin! [Natalie ] Anyway-- Anyway, what's a little damage? It's not as if I'm not insured. Do you have something to say? Thankyou. - And? - I'm sorry for the damage ofyour house. [ Audio Rewinding ] The security cameras must have got the whole thing on tape. What? Prescott must have turned offthe cameras. [ Marv ] It's unbelievable. It is not to be believed! I can't believe this! It's the lousykidagain. Everywhere I break into! It's like he's stalking me or something. Come on, Marv. He's just a little boy. Yeah, well, I got big scars from that little-- Never mind. I'll tell you one thing... this time he's not gonna mess me up. - Mm-hmm. - This time it's all gonna go smooth as silk. Because this time... I got an inside man. - [ Chuckling ] - [ Chuckling ] Oh. [ Chuckles ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Tires Squeal ] Hey, hey, hey, hey! - [ Horn Honking ] - [ Marv ] Hey, come on! Watch the road! Safety first. - [ Screams ] - What are you doing here? - Tell me. - I, uh-- I-- Nothing. I swear. I thought all ofthis was cool. I wanted to take a look at it. You don't go to other people's homes uninvited, and you don't touch their things. Didn't I warn you what would happen ifl ever caughtyou in here again? Not specifically. Trust me. It won't be pleasant. - [Knocking On Door] - What doyou want? I thought I heard the boy. Ah! And indeed I did. I don't want him bothering you anymore, so I'll just get him out ofyourway. Come along, Kevin. He'll be my responsibility from now on. Thankyou for saving me, Molly. Prescott is a good person to stay away from. You're telling me. He's one ofthe bad guys-- the bad guys who broke into the house. Although technically they didn't break in, because they had their own remote. - And who do you think gave them that? - Prescott? - Mm-hmm. - That sounds a bit far-fetched to me. I know. And you probably think I have an overactive imagination. Most people do. But you have to believe me. Kevin, Prescott is a lonely man. The only thing he has is this job. Between you and me, he hates working here. - But to do what you're suggesting-- - Then it all makes perfect sense. He hates his job, so he tries to pull off a big heist so he can afford to quit. - Ah, I don't know. - Listen. He told my dad I was lying when I wasn't. Andhe shut offthe security cameras. So it can onlymean one thing. - And that is? - Marv and his new friend... have an inside guy-- - Prescott. - I thinkyou're right. - I am? - Yeah. You do have an overactive imagination. But that's what I love about children. My own son was the same as you atyour age-- a real handful. You must have been a great mom, Molly. Well, you just try to keep that imagination under control, okay? && [ Classical On Stereo ] [Peter] You were veryunderstanding about what happened today. Well, Kevin's going through a difficult time. It's not easy when your parents split up. Believe me, I know. But we'll get through it. You're gonna be a great stepmom. && [ Continues ] [ Exhales ] I thinkwe just need to figure out a way to make him feel more at home here. Maybe do some ofthe Christmas things he's used to doing, like trimming the tree. - You do thatyourself? - [ Chuckles ] Yes, I do that myself. It's fun. That's exactlywhat we're gonna do. We're gonna trim the tree. It'll get us in the spirit ofthings, unite us as a family. - Okay. - Okay? No friends, no fun, no snow. This is definitely gonna be the worst Christmas ever. Hey, Kev. How you doing? [ Sighs ] What do you saywe forget about today and start over, huh? - You mean it? - Yeah. Natalie's really a great person. You just gotta get to know her better. I thinkwe should start having a little more fun around here. - I could live with that. - Yeah? Why don't we start by trimming that tree? - Now? - Sure. Why not? && [Pop, Women Singing] [Phone Rings ] [Ringing Continues ] Hello. I can't hearyou. Can you turn down the music? - Music, off. - && [Fades, Ends ] What did you say? Ofcourse we'll be there. We wouldn't miss it. - Let me call you back. - [ Phone Beeps Off] Evangelista's in town. Margaret's throwing together a little impromptu supper... but we shouldn't go, should we? Well, why don'tyou go ahead without me, and Kevin and I will finish up over here? Really? You wouldn't mind? No. They'reyour friends anyway. You're an angel. I won't be home late. Okay. Where were we? - You don't have to stay because of me. - No, I want to stay. Really. So, does Natalie go out every night? Pretty much. She leads a very exciting life-- more exciting than we're used to. So you'd say you're not in a rut? No, I'm not in a rut. Why? I thought maybe that's whyyou left. Kevin. Kevin, you know-- I didn't leave your mom to be with Natalie, okay? - That just kind ofhappened later. - You wanna tell me about it? [ Exhales ] Adult relationships are just complicated. Sometimes when two people get married reallyyoung likeyour mom and I did... you just end up feeling kind of-- - You missed out on some things. - Yeah. Just 'causeyou grow up on the outside... doesn't mean you wanna stop having fun. I know all about the inner child, Dad. - Oh. You do, huh? - That's why old guys drive sports cars. You're probably right. But the trouble with sports cars-- no room for anybody else. Maybe one other person max. But ifyou want to take a real road trip... with luggage andall, you don't even have room for a friend. I mean, they're cool and fast and all... but who wants to be in a nice car when you're all alone? [ Kate Sighs ] Well, that looks just about perfect. All that's left to do now is put on the star. Kevin always puts on the star. That's right. He does, doesn't he? I always hold him up. And then I give him a wedgie. [ Chuckles ] He makes a fuss. We all laugh. Well, I guess we're just gonna have to use the ladder this year. Okay, Dad, you can put me down now. Wow. Looks pretty good. I think it looks great. I think it's our best tree yet. [ Peter On TV] Hey! [ Family Chattering ] - Merry Christmas, Mommy. - [Kevin ] Merry Christmas. - [Kate On TV] Merry Christmas. - [All Chattering] Oh! Look at that! - [ Kate ] Hey. Hey. - [ Peter ] Hey. [ Peter] I had this little computer chip installed in Mom. We're gonna get her to make some breakfast. - [ Yawns ] Morni ng. - Morni n'. Good morni ng, sleepyheads. You're finally up. What did you do to our tree? Oh, that's myfault. I have a standing appointment with the tree decorators everyyear. In all the excitement, I forgot to cancel. Are you ever gonna forgive me? You undid our tree? Well, it would have had to come down eventually anyway. Come on, Kev. Look at all these presents, huh? Oh, wait. Ooh, here's a big one. I believe it has-- Yes, it has your name on it. Come on. Open it up. It's from Natalie and me. But shouldn't I open it tomorrow on Christmas? Ah, you got plenty to open tomorrow. Come on. One won't hurt. Go ahead. - [ Gasps ] - Super Spy bugging and listening device. - Isn't that cool? - Yeah. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Natalie. I'm glad you like it. - Hey, Mom, where areyou going? - I'm going to take Kevin some things. - Mom, whereyou going? - He doesn't have any clean clothes... and I'm sure he doesn't have anytoys to playwith. To check out Dad's girlfriend. Wanna go? [Doorbell Rings ] May I help you? - Wow! - I'm here for Kevin McCallister. - Wow! - Buzz. - Are you here to take him home? - No, I have something for him. Right this way. [Peter] You should be able to hearthat. - How do I sound? - [ Kate On Headset ] Kids, stay close. - Mom! - Hey! Hey! Mmm! Ohh! - [ Chuckles ] - You guys remember Natalie, right? - Buzz, Megan. - Hi, Natalie. Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is Natalie. - Natalie, Kate. - Hello, Kate. Hello. So, areyou guys gonna stay? - No, I just broughtyou some ofyour stuff. - You guys gotta see this house. - Is that okay, Natalie? - Of course. Be my guest. - Awesome tree! - It used to look better. - What is this thing on your head? - A spy kit that Natalie got me for an early Christmas present. Really? That was nice ofyou. Well, I'm very fond ofyour kids. I've gotta showyou this airplane she got me. Would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, no, thankyou. - I, uh, didn't know he would have all this stuffto playwith. - Yeah. Oh, God. Hey. Let me get that. I wasn't even sure he could even sleep without it. Gosh. I cannot believe he hasn't even asked for it. Well, we could buy him another stuffed animal. - Oh, no, no. - No. This is, uh, his Teddy. Teddy is his transitional object. Yeah. Transitional object. It's like something very, veryspecial a child carries with him everywhere. You're supposed to have a spare, in case something happens to it. - Ofcourse, we only had one, remember? - Oh! How could I forget? We were driving down the highway, really in a hurry. Kevin thinks, possibly Teddy might want a little fresh air. So he rolls down the window and out flies Teddy! He was ballistic. He was crying. He was so upset. It was-- Oh, my-- So Peter pulls over, and I get out to retrieve the bear. - I still can't believe you did that. - [ Chuckles ] Well, it was the slow lane, and there wasn't much traffic. Yeah, well, I don't know what he would have done ifhe had lost it. I think Kevin's going to have so much fun playing with the prince... that he's not even gonna miss the stuffed animal. It's going to be wonderful having a house full ofchildren. I'm looking forward to it. Children, watch the garden sculpture! Wel l, I... better get goi ng. Before they break somethi ng. Wel l, we're off to the airport to pick up the royal family. You all know how important this is. Now, the caterers will be here momentarily. And the guests will arrive about an hour before... - you and the royals makeyourgrand entrance. - [Molly] No need to worry. Everything will be taken care of. - It's just that I want everything to go right. - Come on. Let's not be late. I don't want one single thing to go wrong. Door, open. And nothing will. [People Chattering] [Knocking On Door] [Prescott] Oh, good. You've finallyarrived. - Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! It's them! - Hush, you. - I 'll get him out ofyour way. - Thankyou. It's the burglars! It's the burglars! Aah! Mr. Prescott! [Kevin Yelling] It's Marv! I guess you already knew that though. Listen, you. I have just about had enough ofyou and your melodrama! This is a very important night, and if I have to lockyou up to keepyou out of ourway... - don't think I won't do it. - Look! Ow! Ow! Ow! Don't trifle with me, you demon spawn! Now that's a foolish place to hide. [ Groans ] One down, two to go. [ Muffled ] Let me out ofhere! Let me out ofhere! It's freezing cold! Let me out! Kevin, haveyou seen Prescott? - Not lately. - Ah, typical. Always poking around when you don't want him... - and when you need him-- nowhere to be found. - [ Doorbell Rings ] Ah! Guests already? Whatever happened to fashionably late? [Natalie ] Well, I don't like to boast, but... - yes, it will be the party ofthe season. - [ Beep ] Oh, I'm getting another call. All right. See you there. Hel lo? Carmel i na, how are you? [ Mouthi ng Words ] What? Oh, no! They're snowed in. Their flight's been canceled. Wel l, so am I. Devastated. Well, all right. We'll see you tomorrow. Merry Christmas. [ Phone Beeps Off] What are we gonna do now? It's gonna be just an ordinary party. Christmas Eve at your place sounds anything but ordinary to me. It's hardly the party ofthe season. Peter. - What ifwe announce our engagement tonight? - Tonight? I know we were gonna wait till afteryour divorce was final... but it's onlya few weeks away andyourkids alreadyknow... and it'll make tonight so special. Well, if it makes you happy. Yes! [ Chuckles ] Where are those guys? - Marv, I gotta tinkle. - Vera, you can tinkle next week. [ Marv On Headset ] Always in a hurry. Door, open. All right. Now, you remember the plan? - Which plan? Harry's plan? - What-- No! Not Harry's plan! - The one involving rope and a bag! - Why areyou yelling at me? I'm notyell-- - Doyou remember the plan? - Yeah. - Now, when the prince comes up to bed-- - We bag him! - That's right. We kidnap the kid napping. - You're a genius, Marv. That's right. Door, open. Now, the prince goes in the bag. - The bag goes out the window. - Uh-huh. We climb down the rope. Door, close. Right. [ Marv On Headset ] Everybody in the van. And we're gone before they know what hit 'em. Beautiful plan, Marv. Elegant in its simplicity. All right. Let's tryit out. Get in the bag. Me? Why don't you get in the bag? Because I'm the boss. Get in the bag, Vera. - I don't wanna get in the bag. - Vera, just get in the bag! Please! You didn't tell me I was gonna get in no bag. I was saving it. It's gonna be fun. Ooh, we're in the bag! - [ Grunting ] - [ Groaning ] Nice. All right. Window, open. Ahh. [ Grunts ] [Vera ] Uh, Marv. Ooh. Oh. [ Grunts ] Don't worry, honey. I got ya. Marv! Let me down easy. I always do, baby. [ Straining ] Shouldn't have had that last piece of cake. [ Yelps ] [Rope Creaking] - Perfect. - Door, open. [ Screams ] - [ Groans ] - Don't worry. Everything's under control. Uh, uh, Marv-- [ Screaming ] - [ Thud] - Easy... but still way cool. [ Marv Groaning] Thanks for breaking my fall, pumpkin. [ Hoarse Voice ] I always do, baby. Okay. Get out and stay out! - I know what you're trying to do. - Oh, yeah, wise guy? What? You're trying to kidnap the prince. Shut up, ya little moron! - I'm gonna kill him. - Okay. [ Chuckling ] [ Raspberry] Vera, honey. Little help? Oh, yeah, baby. That'd be great. I sure could use it. - [ Marv Groaning On Headset ] - I got everyword. [ Imitates Cheer] && [ Classical On Stereo ] - Welcome back. Where's the royal family? - Theywere snowed in. - Ah! - Where's Prescott? - I can't find him anywhere. - That's odd. Well, Molly, make sure everyone has champagne. - We're going to make a special announcement. - Yes, ma'am. - How areyou? - Hi, how are you? Good to see you again. Everyone, may I have your attention? Huh? I am gonna kill that-- Uuh! - [ Clattering] - [Screaming] This is always a special night, and tonight may be even more special. - [ Seething ] - Get him! - Peter and I are engaged! - [ Crowd Exclaiming] [ Screams, Shouts ] - [ Teeth Chattering ] - Prescott? - [ Softly Moaning ] - This could not be goin' worse. Marv, you're on fire. Oh, thanks, baby. You're not so bad yourself. No, sweetheart. You're really on fire. Well, I try to work out. You know-- Aah! Gaah!Aah! - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - Kevin! I'm not lying. The bad guys are back. We're not getting anywhere. Kevin, I spoke to all the caterers and to Molly. Nobodysaw a thing butyou. Now, how could that be? I don't know. But I heard they're gonna kidnap the prince. - You heard them say that? - Yeah, with mySuperSpybugging device. - And Prescott's involved with the whole thing. - This is absurd. I'm going to call and make sure the royal family's flight is okay for tomorrow. Kevin, I know what's going on here. - You do? - Yeah. - You're out to destroy my relationship with Natalie. - What? You knew how important tonight was to her, and you went and pulled a crazy stunt like this. - That's not the truth. - I've given you a lot ofleeway... because I know how tough this divorce has been on you. But tonightyou went waytoo far. I want you to go to your room and think about what you've done. And when you're ready to apologize to Natalie, then we'll talk. Door, close. - Here you are, George! Merry Christmas! - [Woman Crying] [ Ringing ] - Hello? - Mom? Kevin! Oh, Kevin. I'm so glad you called. Areyou okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm just watching It's a Wonderful Life. - You are? - You know how that gets to me. - What channel is it on? - Eight. Ohh. I guess I'm just a sucker for happy endings. So, how is your party? Are you havin' a good time? Yeah, it's all right. How aboutyou? Havin' a good Christmas Eve? Yeah. It's great. [ Sniffles ] - [ Sobs ] I loveyou, Kevin. - Loveyou too, Mom. [ Laughs ] Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Okay. Bye. [ Beeps Off] [ Beeps Off] [ Crying ] [Knocking] - Kevin, are you awake? - Yeah. Your father and I were a little rough on you before. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Good. Because ifyou ever do anything like that again, you'll be out ofthis house so fast... your head will spin. So your father's getting divorced. Boo-hoo. Everyone's parents get divorced. That's life. You'll get over it. But you're not gonna come between your father and me. He wants you in his life, and I think that's admirable. But ifyou want him in your life, you better not cross me. Understood? Good. I'll have that window fixed first thing in the morning. Sweet dreams. [Man On TV] To mybig brother George, the richest man in town. [ Crowd Exclaiming] I've just had a nice little chat with Kevin. I think we're beginning to understand each other better. What are you watching? It's a Wonderful Life. They've been running it all night. - Come on. Watch it with me. - I 've seen it. - So? - So... I don't understand people who watch movies over and over again. I saw it. I cried. Once was enough. You gotta be kidding. Kate and I watch this everyyearwith the kids. It's a familytradition. - Well... - [ Clicks Off] now that you're going to have a new family, maybe it's time for some new traditions. They'll be back. And if no one believes me... I'll have to catch 'em myself. [ Grunts ] [ Marv's Voice ] Shut up, you little moron. [ Clicks Off] [Keyboard Clacking] Shut up, you moron. - [Kevin ] Okay, stop. - [ Beeps ] [ Electronic Voice ] Spin Faster. [Keyboard Clacking] [ Marv's Voice ] Get in the bag. Shut up, ya bag! - Christmas morning. - Merry Christmas, Kevin. - Merry Christmas, Dad! - Hey, hey! - Peter, are you ready to go? - Go? Go where? Kevin, Natalie and I gotta go pick up the royal family right now. Now? But aren't we gonna open presents? It's gonna have to wait till we get back. But it's Christmas. And why doyou both have to go? Look, you know how sometimes you gotta do things you don't wanna do? This is one ofthose times. Hey, we'll be back before you know it, okay? And I'm sure nothing will happen while we're gone. Am I right? - Right. - Good. Hang in there. We won't be long. - Door, open. - [ Door Opens ] [ Natalie ] Merry Christmas, Kevin. [ Door Shuts ] Merry Christmas. [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Beeps On ] Hello? - No, we're awake. - It wasn't me! Shh! All right. We're on ourway. - [ Beeps Off] - Oy. Sure makes me nervous. Let's go, pookie. I knewit. Here they come. First step-- eliminate the inside man. Oh, Mr. Prescott? - Mr. Prescott, areyou in there? - [Pounding] - Yes. - Mr. Prescott... - can you help me with something? - And what would that be? - Another milk shake, perhaps? - No. A bottle ofwine. - Excuse me? - Natalie said we need to get some wine from the basement... for the royal family. Ifwe must. So I guess you're right. We're not gonna have any snow this Christmas. One can never go wrong with low expectations. You know, Mr. Prescott, it's been great spending time with you these last few days. Time flies when you're having fun. I know we got off to a bad start, but things can be better-- much better. - 'Cause you're down there, and I'm up here. - Come get-- - [Pounding] - Young man, open this door! Let me out ofhere! - Oh! - Oh, boy! Am I glad to see you! The kidnappers are coming. But this time I'm one step ahead ofthem. I locked thei r accom pl ice i n the basement. I s this a perfect plan, or what? It would be, dear, except for one thing-- Prescott is not their accomplice. I am. [ Gasps ] You're-- You're the inside man? - I'm afraid so. - Hey, Mom. We're here. Oh, yeah, yeah. - Mom? He's your son? - I told you he was a handful. - Aah! Hey! Get off of me! - Oh, now, come on! Isn't there a trapdoor or something? No. Not much demand for 'em in a wine cellar. Guess you're right. Got any good ideas? Not a one. [ Sighs ] - I do have a cell phone though. - Perfect! May I? - Sure. - Thanks. [ Beeping ] [ Ringing, Beeps On ] - Hello, Buzz? - Kevin, is that you? - Yeah. I'm calling from a cell phone. - Oh, a cell phone. Good foryou, puke-face. Is that another present she gave you? What a showoff. [ Beeps Off] - I'll try again. - [Keypad Beeping] [ Ringing, Beeps On ] Buzz, before you hang up, I need to tell you something. I need to talk to Mom. - Okay. You told me. - [ Beeps Off] - [ Beeps Off] - I'll try again later. [ Sighs ] Why in heaven's name did you think I was the inside man? Well, ifyou hadn't acted so strange, I wouldn't have thoughtyou were... so strange. And where wereyou the first time these guys broke in? Whydidn'tyou answerthe intercom? Why didyou shut offthe cameras? I didn't. But if those thugs were using Molly's remote... they could've turned off the whole security system. - But why'd you say I was lying? - Well, because I thought you were. And besides, I didn't want Miss Natalie to know that I'd been... well, napping on the job. That woman. Ifshe could work me 24 hours a day, she would. It's downright inhuman. So, whenever she's not here, I, uh-- - You take advantage. - I take a break. A nice, well-deserved break. With all the cameras and intercoms turned off, I didn't notice anything. - So I -- - You were covering your whoo-hoo! [ Chuckles ] Precisely. - You want to try calling your mom again? - Sure. [ Ringing ] - Hello? - Mom? - Kevin! - [ Static ] - Wait. Kevin, I can't hearyou. - That's probably 'cause I'm locked in a wine cellar. No, I-- Honey, I can't hearyou. There's too much static. [ Yelling ] I'm locked in Natalie's wine cellar! - Areyou calling to say Merry Christmas? - Mom, areyou there? - Sweetheart? - Areyou there, Mom? - Kevin? Mom? Mom? [ Beeps Off] Oh, great! The battery's dead. [ Sighs ] Hmm. [Ringing] - [ Beeps On ] - Kalban residence. Hi, this is Kate McCallister, Kevin's mom. May I speak to him, please? - Kevin's not here right now. - That's strange. He just called. Really? Well, he's out with his father and Miss Natalie. Oh. Oh, he must have called from his Dad's cell phone. That explains the line going dead. Okay. Thankyou. [ Clicks, Dial Tone ] [Beeps Off] Little rascal called his mother. - You want me to go show him who's boss? - Sit down, Marv. You're not the boss. I'm the boss. Okay. [ Mouths Words ] His cellphone is dead. I don't think he'll be anymore trouble. No. Cookie. - [ Cell Phone Rings ] - Oh! - [ Beeps On ] - Hello? Peter, it's me. I 'm calling Kevin back. We got disconnected. Kevin? Kevin's not with me. He's back at Natalie's house. Really? I was just told he's with you. Well-- Well, don't worry, Kate. I'm sure everything's fine. Okay. - Wow, that's weird. - [Phone Beeps Off] - Someone told Kate that Kevin's with us. - Hmm. - Maybe I better go back and check on him. - No. That's exactlywhat he wants. Peter, he's manipulating you. Can't you see the pattern? Every time we leave the house, he pulls something. He's just trying to getyour attention and sabotage me. Hello! Anybody out there? Hello! There's gotta be something that we can do to get outta here. There is. - Help me move these boxes. - Okay. But what's back there? Definitely not a "dumb" question. - The dumbwaiter! - Bingo. - Let's hope it still works. - I'm sorry I misjudged you, Mr. Prescott. Likewise. I'll never forget Miss Natalie's reaction... when she came home and saw whatyou'd done to the house. - [ Rapid Panting ] - [ Wheezing, Laughing ] I do love watching her hyperventilate! [ Laughs ] It's one ofthe few pleasures ofthis job. Ifyou hate this job, why don'tyou quit? Jobs aren't that easy to come by. Besides, I could end up working for someone farworse. You shouldn't stay someplaceyou hate just 'causeyou're scared. Life's too short. Hmm. And voil??. Let's see ifyou fit. Mm, up. - Watch your head. - As soon as I get up, I'm gonna letyou out. - You just take care ofyourself, you hear? - [Switch Clicks, Whirring] [Marv] I'm tellin'ya, I heardsomething. All right. Stay very alert here, Vera. I tell you what. Why don't you go down, check out the wine cellar? - Okay. - Yeah. There you go. [Kevin ] Down here! You better stay-- Oww! Vera! Ow! Aah! Vera! - What? Ooh! - Hit the button! - Hang on, baby! Huuh! - Oh! No, no! Hit the button! - What? I can't hearyou. - Hit the button! - Oh! - Oww! No, no! Not that one! The other button! That's it! Oww! Hey! Man! Over here! - [ Groaning ] - [Kevin Laughing] - Hi, Mommy. - [ Gasps ] - Yes! - [ Clicking Buttons ] See ya. Door, open! [ Grinding ] Natalie, you go get the royals. I'm gonna go back and check on Kevin. - What, now? - Yeah, somethin's up. I can sense it. - Maybe you have to be a parent. - That's not fair. You know how much I care about kids. How much do you care about my kid? Taxi! Kevin? Are you all right? [ Grunting ] [ Horn Honking ] Mom, do you thinkyou could slow down a little bit? Kevin's probably fine. You just keep an eye out for cops, okay? All right, Vera. Go check out the living room. See ifhe's in there, all right? God! I can't believe this. I shoulda gone to college. Twoyears, coulda been a dental technician. Twoyears! Marv! He's in the bedroom! - Mom? - Get him! Door, open. Got ya. Uuh! Gaah! Aah! Ooh! Door, close. - Hey, Molly! - Get in there! - Marv, honey. You in there? - [ Beeps ] - Shut up, Vera! - Well, okay. I was just tryin' to-- - Shut up, you moron. - Hey, I'm no moron, you jerk. - Shut up, ya bag! - Door, open! - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? I ain't no bag. And you know what? You ain't no genius! - Vera, honey-- - No! Don't "Vera, honey" me! - Honey-- - You're not even as smart as this kid, who, in case you hadn't noticed... is totallykickin'ourbutts! Well, from now on, I am my own boss! - Vera. Vera, honey-- - Don't " honey" me! Pumpkin. Pumpkin. Marv! Forget about her! Get the kid! I'll be outta here in a few minutes. [ Buzzing] [ Thuds, Buzzing Stops ] Oh! [ Chuckling ] Whoa! [ Yelping ] [ Both Groaning] Hey! Hey! Open sesame. - Well, get a load of that. - Holy majolie! Come on, Vera! All right! Come on out, kid! Ah! All right. - Open bar. Open bookshelf. - [Buzzes ] Open-- Open book-bar. Open book-bar-shelf. - Open-- Open book-bar-thing. - Open sesame. That's stupid. Whoa! - Who's stupid now, stupid? - Hey, come on.Just get off me, all right? [Marv] I'm gonna take care ofeverything. Bar, revolve sesame. [Marv] Watch this. It's all gonna be fine. - Bar, stop. - Oh! It's goin' faster! Yeah, I know, Vera. I know it's goin'faster. - Speed faster sesame. - Okay.

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. - Good night. Aah! - [Kevin Gasps ] - Mr. Prescott! - Atyour service. - Boy, am I glad to see you. - [ Chuckles ] - Perhaps we should call the police. - Good idea, Mr. Prescott. Just " Prescott" to you. " Prescott"! - I thought you said you weren't worried. - I don't know. I just had a feeling. - [ Marv, Vera Gasping ] - [Peter] Kevin! Dad! - Mom! - Mom? - Who are they? - Uh-oh! - Let's get outta here! - Around the back! - We're on it. Let's go! - Kevin! Ooh-ooh! Yes! - Uuh! - Yeah! Way to go, guys! [Kate ] Kevin! - Kevin! - Mom! - Oh, honey! I'm so glad you're all right. - Ohh! - I am now! - I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. - Mmm! - [Prescott Clears Throat] The police have been summoned. I've got lots offun planned foryour stay. Can we go to Wrigley Field? And the aquarium? Doyou have any kids? No. But I promise we'll have a very exciting time. - [ Sirens Wailing ] - Cool! - Oh, come on. No, prison's not so bad. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. On Thursdays you get Salisbury steak. - Yeah, I know about prison. - That's where I metyou. - Calm down. Calm down. - You calm down. - Women, eh? - Yeah. - Hey, don't touch me. - Peter! What's he done now? - Well, he saved the day, that's what. You should be thanking him. Molly? What in the world is going on? It seems they were gonna kidnap the prince. Best we can gather, she's the boss. She's my maid. I'm her boss! Well, looks like you're gonna have to find a new maid. Anda newbutler, I'm afraid. - I resign. - Resign? But... why? Because as a wise young man once said, " Life's too short." Peter, do something. All right. Here goes. Natalie, I think I mistook... infatuation andexcitement forlove. Look, this-- this is yourworld. It's not mine. The whole time I was here, all I did was miss my family. I'm in love with mywife and kids... and I belong with them. And I wanna come home. I mean, I understand ifyou need time to think about it. Mom? - Oh! - [ Crying ] - I love you. - I love you. Young man, how are we ever going to showyou our gratitude? Would your family like to spend Christmas with our family? That sounds cool. - Is that okay? - [ Chuckles ] Yes. You're going to be with them? Today? On Christmas?
