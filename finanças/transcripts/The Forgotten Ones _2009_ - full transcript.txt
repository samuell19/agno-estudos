Just-- You know how the saying goes-- Behind every great man there's a great woman-- and a wife. You know damn well I'm trying to go straight on Liz and not mess stuff up. Yeah, I'm just trying to-- No, no, no. See, it's not cool. It's no wonder Lauren dumped your ass. You got anything else to say? No, I'm cool. I think we're lost. Honey? Huh? I said I think we might be lost. What are you talking about? Shouldn't we be seeing land by now? See? We're not lost. Peter, come on. I'm serious. Hey, something isn't right. What's not right is how good you look. Peter, don't. Don't. All right, look. Make you a deal. What? Oh, what? I'll take care of this now. Captain this boat. You take care of me later. That's even hotter. Let me captain.Okay. I'll be back.All right. This is killin' me. Look, man, you don't own a woman like that. You lease 'em. What can I say? Put up a big down payment on that one. We all make bad deals. That's right. Hey, baby, remember, no carrots, okay? I heard Mo bought this island. Not only that. I hear he got Ian Schrager to design the resort. Jesus. Have a little steak with that ketchup. How would you like me to eat it? Hey, all I'm sayin' is, if you want to ruin a perfectly good thing, go right ahead. Seems to be what you're good at. Careful. You don't wanna choke. Actually, you'd be surprised at how much she can fit in her mouth. - What's that? - Two words-- "small penis." Jakey's covered, baby. I'm gonna be wiping my ass with Lincolns. Get over yourself. Sorry, babe. Money never sleeps. Sleeps pretty good when you have enough of it. Oh. And F.Y.I. Franklins? They're much softer on the ass. And we all know you have plenty of ass that needs to be wiped. You schmuck.Guys? Come on. Babe, will you come up here for a sec? Hi. What's wrong? Who's this for? What do you mean? I can't eat it, baby. Okay. I just forgot. No, it's fine. I'll fix it.Hey, sweetie. Sweetie. I'm not mad.I know. I just can't eat it that way.I'll just fix it for you, okay? Who was that? What? Who was that on the phone? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't know. It was one of those weird numbers. That's why I didn't pick up. Like, you know the kind when you get charged 200 bucks a minute? You-- I don't know. Let me see the phone. Are you serious? Let me see the phone. You gotta be kiddin' me. What's the matter with you? Come on. What, you don't trust me? Just give me the phone. I just-- I'm not gonna give you the phone. - I just wanna see it. - Stop it, Liz. Come on! Liz-- Ow. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just nicked my finger. Run some cold water on it. It's just a cut, sweetie. You'll live. Hey. What's wrong? Peter. I think he's messing around again. Oh. I doubt that. And even if he is, so what? Two words-- "trust fund." I'm not for sale, Laur. I just feel like I've given up my whole life for this guy, and he doesn't even take me seriously. How much longer am I supposed to wait around? I just feel like I should be making something of my life. Look, the only thing you should be making is wedding plans. Trust me. Hey, Liz. Hey, baby, can you hear me? Hey, baby. Open your eyes. Sweetie. Hey. Sweetie. Open your eyes. Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Where are we? Hey, Mo, can you hear me? Mo. Dude, if you're not calling me right now... to say you've arrived, I have nothing to say to you. And another thing--Mo, seriously, knock this stuff off. This is-- This is serious. I'll tell you what's serious, mother bitcher. There are Latin American chicks with some of the biggest titties you've ever seen in your life, and my birthday cake is smeared all over-- Look, there's a problem with the boat. What do you mean? We're stuck on an island. The boat is sunk. We're okay, but we just need you to come get us, all right? What do you mean, boat is sunk? I'll cut your balls, Peter. Peter! Hello? Are you still there? Yeah. Dude, tell me you aren't making funny joke. Look, I'll tell you about it when you come get us. All right? Aw, Hare Krishna. Give me the coordinates. It looks like we're one of the smaller islands off of Antilles. Uh, 13-67-55 north latitude. 16-35-57 north longitude. Peter, there doesn't seem to be any land there, amigo. Well, there is, 'cause we're standing on it. Okay, okay. I'll find you. And when I do, you better have a good explanation, you cock smoocher. You copy that? I just bought this. I'll buy you a new one. I got it. Thanks. Hey, pal. Hey. Hey. I got this one. Thanks. I'll take it from here. Thanks. Okay. Oh, man! Wow. You really hit the jackpot with this one. What are you doing? There's some-- There's something in there. Something-- Something pulled me. Come on, can you go look? I heard something, Peter. I believe you. I want to go home. Why don't we just get on the raft? We can leave now. I'm not floating around in a blowup raft in the middle of the ocean... when I can be picked up in a luxury yacht. You're not listening to me. I don't wanna go to Mo's. I wanna go home. - That's a little selfish, don't you think? - Selfish? If you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn't even be in this mess. - Look, honey, there was no way-- - No, don't "look, honey" me. I am sick and tired of the world according to Peter. You don't get it, do you? I hate going on these stupid trips. Standing around watching you and your disgusting friends... binge drink and ogle at strippers? Look. I'm sorry. You know I love you. Well, if you love me, stop telling me. Show me. What are you doing? Checking to see where he is. Relax, man. He said he'll be here. Really? Sounded like to me he didn't know where this island is. I said he'll be here. If he's not here in an hour, we're leaving. Hey, where you going? Does it matter? Who stole her pom poms? Hey, are these the only ones? Uh, yeah. Why? Now is as good a time as any. Peter? Laur? Guys? Peter? Laur? Come on, this isn't funny. What the hell are you doing? Something I gotta show you. I know you thought this trip was for Mo's birthday, but that's not exactly true. It's supposed to be an engagement party. Mo's getting engaged? Not really. Oh, my God. Um, I totally had this whole speech, man, but I didn't think I was gonna be this nervous. Look, Liz, I know I've been an idiot, and I know I've messed up, but when I think about the rest of my life, there is no doubt in my mind that I wanna spend it with you. Okay. I got you a real one, but it's probably in the belly of a shark right now. Liz, will you marry me? Yeah.Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Party time! Yay! Congratulations. Congratulations. Yeah! Whoo! It's about time. Did you tell them about it? Mmm, what? Your parents. Did you tell them? Mom knows. What about your dad? Not yet. He hates me, Peter. It'll be fine. Honey, what if it's not? What if he sends you away? No one's taking me away from you. You promise? On my life. Peter! Hello? Anybody there? Hello! Anybody there? Come on! Fuck! What are you doing? - We're goin' in. - We're going in? That's your big plan? Unless you got a better idea, that's what we're doing. - We should go and get help. - I think he's right, Jake. No. No. No. What are you saying? You wanna leave? I just think it's a bad idea to go in the jungle. Fuck what you wanna think, all right? If that was her out there, your fat ass would be in there trying to find her too. Okay, fine. You and G.I. Jane, you go on your little rescue mission. We're leaving. What is the matter with the two of you? He's out there in serious trouble, and all you can think about is yourselves? We're not leaving. We're just going to get help. Let's go. I'm sorry. Put the raft down. Peter! Yo, Pete! Peter? Peter! Liz! Liz, wait up. You all right? Jesus. He's here. Liz! Wait, Liz. Stay here. Oh, shit. What is it? Oh, God. What was that? I don't know. It was probably some kind of monkey. What the hell kind of monkey would do this? Peter. Liz! Liz! Liz, wait. There's something stalking us, Liz. Why don't you get that? We're not gonna die. Just trust me. How do you know? Come on. We have to do this. For Peter. No way.Lauren, stop being so selfish. Two words, Jake-- "fuck you." Lauren-- Lauren! Take it, all right? Help! Help me! If anything moves, shoot it, all right? - Uh-huh. Move, man. Move. Jake! Jake! Jake! I'm comin', Laur.Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! What's happening? Get my hand. Please! Reach for me. Reach for me. What's happening? I've got you. I've got you. I got you. Reach. Reach. I got you! Don't let go. Don't let go. - Lauren! - Oh, my God. - Jake? - What's goin' on? Shoot! Just shoot in the tree. Shoot, Liz. Shoot 'em. Please! Please! I got ya! Got ya. Jake! I'm cutting you down. Jake? What did you do? Where is she? Is she dead? - What did you do? - Ira, put-- put the gun down. I will kill you. Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren? Lauren! Lauren. Lauren. Lauren. Oh, Lauren, baby. Can you hear me? Just stay with me. We're gonna take you out of here. I swear to God. Just keep breathing. Just breathe. What? What is it, baby? Jake? Jake. Stop! What? Why stop? Huh? You think they're gonna stop killing? They're animals. That's what they do. They kill. I saw what they can do. Everybody's dead, Liz. Ira's dead. Lauren's dead. Pete's dead. Jake? Jake! Liz! Hello? What is this place? I don't know. Geez. This place is a mess. Listen to this. "John entered the caves last night"-- "...to find the others. They still haven't returned. Our initial hypothesis that their hostility towards us... was purely territorial, that if we kept our distance the attacks would stop, was wrong. Every attempt we've made to track or contain them has failed. They hunt in packs. They are led by an alpha male, similar to wolves. The locals refer to them as '‘the forgotten ones.' We do not know much more. The one thing we do know-- they are cannibals. Many have left, but I can't. No! Not until we capture a live specimen." They're gone. Now, Liz, we gotta go now. Liz, we gotta get back to the beach. Lauren? Peter. I love you. You said you'd never leave me. You promised. What the hell are you? Peter. Dude, I'm really cheesed off, man.
