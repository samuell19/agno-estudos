(peaceful music) (children laugh) (flies buzz) (boy coughs) (boy groans) (boy coughs) (siren wails) - Emergency, we have an accident case. 10-year-old male, possible internal injuries. Alert x-ray and the O.R. - Alright, 500 CCs dextrosolocortev. Adrenaline, surgical cotton, sutures, IV set. Okay. (woman whines) (man speaks foreign language) - Minister Uban, your son's going to be fine. The operation relieved the obstruction. Everything's just fine. Dr. Santos will be down in a moment to explain everything. - Thank you. (peaceful music) (flies buzz) (fire crackles) (gulls squawk) (faint rock music) - Can't tell you what a trip it is to be able to work in a place like this for three months. No noise, no smog, no machines. - No machines? (chuckles) Oh, excuse us, senorita. But I cannot live without my machines. You see, even if you go to my humble casa, I have my main type washing machine and drying, and how do you say these, uh, squeeze the orange juicer? - That's a very pretty bikini, Bunny. - Oh, I'm glad you like it, Lucio, pink's my favorite color. When I was head pom-pom girl back at Fadeville High, we had these cute little pink outfits. We have these minis to here with these real, real tight white turtle necks with a big T, right here. - RCA Victrola, AM and FM, long-playing album stereo player. In just a minute, the feast will begin. - Drop these by my towel. Are you sure all this food around here is edible? - Absolutely. - Okay. I'll see you in a minute, I'm gonna pick me a little lunch. - Bye. - Bye. - Lunch! - Anyway, even in America, nurses deliver more babies than the OVs do. They always seem to arrive 10 minutes late. (chuckles) In their golf shoes. Come on. - Lynn? Lunch time! Lynn? Sue? Sue, do you see Lynn? Listen, we better... Oh, there she is! - That's not Lynn. (man speaks foreign language) (gun fires) (man groans) (shooter shouts in foreign language) (shooter laughs) - You filthy son of a bitch! (thud) (shooter laughs) (shooter shouts in foreign language) (tense music) (men laugh) (men laugh) (shooter shouts in foreign language) - [Man] Senore. My car, I have an accident. - Don't you know that it's a 10 peso fine for obstructing a thoroughfare? - Would you give your Jeep to the revolution? I thought not. (officer groans) (officer screams) (tense percussive music) (officer groans) Hey, get the weapons and the Jeep. (peaceful music) (Sue groans) (captor speaks foreign language) (captor speaks foreign language) (captor speaks foreign language) (captor speaks foreign language) (thud) - Animal! (men laugh) (men laugh) - Lynn, don't. (captor shouts in foreign language) (captor speaks foreign language) (tense percussive music) (captor speaks foreign language) (Bunny spits) (men laugh) (Bunny screams) (men laugh) (Guerrilla leader shouts in foreign language) (Bunny grunts) - Oh, help me, please! (Guerrilla leader speaks foreign language) - Sometime you're a real pig. (captor laughs) - Adios, Flavio. (shouts in foreign language) - I'm sorry you were being mistreated. - Who are you, why are we here? - You are here because we had you brought here. We are the People's Army of San Rosario. - [Sue] You're the army of San Rosario? But we're the guests of this country. We're nurses at your government medical center. - Senorita, we are the People's Army. The army you speak of, like the medical center you work at, is property of the government. Neither work for the people of this country. - [Sue] Then you had us kidnapped? - Yes. - But why? - We have need of your services. - What are you talking about, need of our services? What the hell do you think will happen when the American Consul hears about this? - Crao. (speaks foreign language) - You are American citizens. But I do not give a god damn what your consul will do. You speak of rights, your government helped my government steal my rights and their rights, now we take yours. You will cooperate, or I will call back Congaciero and give you to him as a bonus. You all look healthy. You should last five days, maybe a week. We spend the night here, we leave in the morning. (guard whistles) - It's Flavio! - Compadres, here are the nurses we've been waiting for. Tomasa, get them something to wear. Show them where to clean up. - Oh, it feels good. (moans) (woman speaks foreign language) (women laugh) Afraid you'd get lost in there, honey. (women laugh) - Ah, senorita, in San Rosario, we have a saying. As with a passion fruit, more than can be placed in the mouth at one time, it is wasted. - Oh, that's very clever. Now have you got an answer for this one? What the hell are we doing here? - Whatever you are told to do, miss, miss Playboy rabbit. - Do you know what I hope? I hope someday you're on a date and then some maniacs come along and shoot your date and drag you into the jungle, and then attack you and then not even tell you why! (somber music) - That's 23. Nine rifles, four crossbows. - Not much muscle. - (chuckles) It's more than yesterday, Ronaldo. - What we need is automatic weapon. - We need more of everything, and time to teach these people how to use them. Then we are ready to fight. - That's true, Ronaldo, but that's ideal. Now we must show the people that we exist. (speaks foreign language) Now you look more comfortable. This is Ronaldo. You'll be working with him. Now, as to why you are here. Now, we have people who teach us how to kill. But we have no one to teach us how to heal. We have no medical help, none. We have no medical supplies. Not even asprin. What I want you to do is this. Set up a clinical, a um, dispensary here. Tell us what you need, we will get it. Teach us public health so we can teach the villagers we liberate. Teach us first aid. Teach the most able amongst us to be medics. To carry on after you leave. - You expect us to do all that? - The entire staff at Johns Hopkins couldn't do that. - We don't have the entire staff of Johns Hopkins. We have you. - Listen, Fidel. What Sue told you yesterday is where it's at. You can't go around kidnapping people to get help. I don't know about you, but we're helping your people right now, working long hours at that medical center in the capital. - You know, you surprise me, senorita. An American black woman who is so naive. How many of my people have you helped in that beautiful testament to the dictator's progress? Not the ones that come in shiny cars with uniforms. The ones that come on feet with no shoes. - You sure know your propaganda. - Enough! I'll state it more simply for you. I have had you kidnapped. You will do what you are told to do. If not, you will all be shot. You have 24 hours to decide. In the meantime, make yourself acquainted with the village and people here, keep your eyes open. You may change your feelings about things. - [Tomasa] Come with me. - Hello, Movelito. How are things in the village? - All fine. - Good. - This came for you. - Garcia's coming. Orfeo. - You will live here, Florida will bring you your sleeping bags and netting for the bunks. - And a broom. If you have one. (Bunny sighs) - I wonder if everybody in this place lives like this. (ominous tones) - Shit. (rooster crows) (suspenseful music) - Mimmo! (Mimmo speaks foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) - Senor Garcia, this is an honor. I am Flavio, this is Crao, Senor Garcia. Hello, Movelito. Everything went well, you must be very tired. Come, we'll have something to drink. - Tomasa, more help? - Garcia, newsman from La Friends a Latino. He comes to report our revolution. - Mornin', sport. (Movelito speaks foreign language) Senorita. Say, aren't you the guy that drives that truck in here? - No, senorita, my father drives the truck. - You mean you don't help out on a long drive like that? - Senorita, I do not drive. Besides, the drive is not so long. - Okay, sport, see ya at the fiesta. (moody music) - Ronaldo Montoya, our chief of instruction. Ronaldo was six years with the government army. - Ah, I'm pleased to meet you. - Senor Garcia. We know the value of what you will write. - Please, we are all working to the same end. Now, what I should like is to be allowed to roam the camp and simply observe the group. My style is a documentary one. - Whatever you wish, we are familiar with your style. - I'm very interested in your foreigners. Tell me about them. (distant grunts) (suspenseful music) - Shit. This fucking thing is a stick, I can't drive it! Watch out for that kid! (gun fires) They're trying to kill us! - Tomasa! Tomasa, no shooting! - [Woman] Man, can't this thing go any faster? - [Lynn] Maybe it can, but I can't! - I'll have your answer now, and it better be yes. See if they've taken anything. I won't bother killing you. You won't do what I've asked, good! I have plenty of work for pigs, whores! You can work on your backs or down on your knees. I think you're well suited for that. Now! Would you like that better? - Sulfur. Antibiotics. Vaccines. Some basic surgical instruments. Okay? We need an entire pharmacy. - If that is what we need, that is what we get. Continue your list, I will make the arrangements. Anything you think of, add it. (peaceful music) - Now, did you all see that? That is the correct procedure for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Now, watch closely while I repeat the procedure. (thud) (men laugh) Now, onto pressure points. - Again, I want to thank you for your hospitality. - I believe we should be thanking you, senor. (Garcia speaks foreign language) (Flavio speaks foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) (grunts) Public Dispensary of Juda Antonio. - Uh-huh, who's going? - Crao, he'll take three men, one of the nurses. - A nurse? - A nurse, yes. We are making a raid for these medical supplies. Now, we must be sure that nothing we need is overlooked. You will go. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - I am taking your assistant for a moment. (man groans) - Excuse me, he stole my nurse. - Ouch! - You can't touch my banana. - Shut up! - Banana go, banana thief, banana robbery, banana-- (officer grunts) (merchant blows raspberry) (knocks) (officer shouts in foreign language) (knocks) (knocks) (grunts) (thuds) - We have nothing, it's the main reason we supply request to Aganar, but nothing ever comes. - Aganar, it's the supply depot for the eastern provinces. They have warehouses, small multiple, light, uh, no no no, moderate defenses. About a platoon of men. - They stock arms as well? Automatic weapons. - Lynn? Hey, you alright? - How was it? - I guess it was just a normal nursing day. We ransacked the clinic, interrupted a compound fracture being set, attacked two policemen and stole their guns, and then just drove home, all for nothing. A big zero. I've got more at home in my medicine cabinet than they did in the whole god damn place. - Imagine, a hospital with no medicine! Well, I'm not surprised, look at how this bunch lives. And they're supposed to change things! - Right on, honey, they're all lazy and dirty, you know. - Lynn, were you able to alert anybody about it? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? Can I make it any clearer? You went to a village, you met policemen, and you made no effort to tell anyone about us? You simple little bleeding heart. All you can do is sit there and whine about what those filthy little hoodlums didn't get. - Why, you overbearing, pompous bitch. Don't you preach to me. I was the one who was out there! I'm really tired of hearing you judge people. Maybe they're not filthy little hoodlums to me. (moody guitar music) (suspenseful music) (guard groans) (guard groans) (man groans) (gun fires rapidly) (distant men shout) (men shout in foreign language) (guns fire) (groans) (guns fire) (men shout) (guard screams) (guns fire) (man groans) (guns fire) (groans) (guard screams) (guns fire) (tires screech) - Roberto, turn it around, turn it! (guns fire) Get the door! Alex, find the guns! (man groans) (gun fires) (gun fires) (guns fires) (Bunny screams) (thud) (Lynn sobs) (guns fire) (guard screams) (guns fire) (guns fire) (woman screams) - Flavio! - Everybody in the Jeep! Alex, the grenade, give it to Jay. (gun fires) Move it! Come on, go, go! (gun fires) (explosion booms) (guns fire) Go! (guns fire) - Five dead, and you call that a success? - I do not call it a success because of the five dead. But because we got what we went for. (peaceful music) - Flavio. - Yes. - That young guy yesterday in the warehouse that was killed. - Reno. - Yes. - Did he have a family? Where did he come from? - Came from where you work, in San Rosario City. He was what you call a draft dodger. - Are most of you people draft dodgers? - Paco, Nemo. Everybody's here for different reasons. You get tired seeing your sisters assaulted, your families abused. Paying a fine week after week for trying to sell what you grow. Maybe because they're all poor, or from families with no influence. That is the biggest crime in this country, Lynn. - And you? - I was luckier than most. I got to my second year at the agricultural college, before I was thrown out for asking too many questions about cooperative farming, government help. - They expelled you for that? - The government finding me unworthy to continue agricultural college was an education. Now I teach what I learned from that, here. - You're a lucky one. A few inches east and you would have lost your weapon. - Sorry. At least you're here to feel it. - They cut us to pieces. I told Flavio we're not ready. (peaceful music) - [Woman] Can I come in? - What is it? - I wanna change that dressing. - Am I no longer Susan's patient? - Look, man, if you want Sue, I'll go get her right now. - (chuckles) No, you do it. You know, I really try, but I still don't understand. Why don't you believe in what we are doing? - It's simple, why should I? Because I'm black? No. This ain't my revolution. If it's a revolution I want, I can join one at home. I just wanna get out of here in one piece. I got a full-time job just taking care of me. - Now I understand. Must be a full-time job. It must be a big, full-time job taking care of such an arrogant, selfish little snob. - You dumb greaser! - Dumb greaser? Tell me something, is that worse than dumb nigger? Now do you understand me? - No, but I guess that just about makes us even, don't it! I'll bet there's something we agree on. No. Like this. No! No. Like this. (peaceful music) - You know, we aren't the only scared people in this camp. - What are you talking about? - Well, Ronaldo told me how he warned Flavio they weren't ready for that raid. He seemed kind of upset when he said it. - Did he say anything else? - What are you thinking? - Well, if what he said to Bunny means he's scared, then maybe he's scared enough to run. And if he is, maybe he can be convinced to take us with him. - Take us with him? We've given our word to cooperate. Besides, we're needed here. - Oh, Lynn, do you wanna die in this place? Don't you think the army's looking for this bunch right now? Oh, look, I want out of here and so does Bunny. Ellie? - I wanna die in Chicago at a good old age. But I wouldn't run off and leave you. - I'll speak with Ronaldo, then you can make up your minds. - Flavio. You're the student from the university. - (speaks foreign language) and there are more to follow. - And they will all be welcome, this is Flavio. (gun fires rapidly) - Senorita, senorita. Look, your pictures. - Oh, they would use that picture. - Does "presumado muerte" mean what I think it does? - Okay, now remember, Tomasa, the object of the sling is to support the weight of the injured arm. Okay, easy. Okay, now by knotting it up at the back, you're able to adjust the elevation of the arm. Okay. (Bunny yelps) - Senorita. You must be more careful where you walk. - Me? You ought to be more careful where you throw that thing! - Senorita, I throw this thing my whole life, and I never miss. - Sure! You never miss. I have a brother like you who never misses, until last year, when he shot off two of his toes with his .22! - Your brother is an amateur, I am a professional. - You're a professional revolutionary? - No, senorita. I am a professional hunter. Flavio does it for the flag, but Crao does it for the sport. (thud) (spring twangs) - Being a soldier for so long has taught me the value of timing. But Falvio's timing, it's wrong. - That's how I feel. Oh, it could've been so different if he just wasn't so pigheaded. - He's my friend. - Then there's gonna be a battle this week, and we're running out? - What is this running out thing of yours? Tell me, is it this revolution you're worried about running out on, or is it Flavio? - Oh, Sue, for Christ's sake, get off it. - Lynn, you can't be so selfish! - Oh, Bunny, it's not a matter of being selfish. What these people are doing is right, and they deserve our help! - My folks must be worried sick by now, and yours too! Those stupid pictures must've been in every paper from here to Cheboygan! - Lynn, please! Teaching them first aid is one thing, but sitting by while they blow people to bits is another. - Lynn, let me talk to you for a minute. Outside. Lynn. I understand what you're saying, but is one nurse really gonna make a difference out here now? They're leaving, no two ways about it. And I wanna leave here, too. But like I said, I don't wanna leave you. Lynn, please. Look at this way if it makes you feel any better. We have done them some good, we've taught them, and now we've gotta leave them to it. There isn't anything more we can do, except, get ourselves killed. (suspenseful music) - Why is it you're defecting, Ronaldo? - Defecting? - Yeah, defecting. Going over to the other side. - I have left the camp and taken you with me as I agreed. If you do not wish to travel any further with me because of what you say I am, then do not. - Lynn, you're not being very fair. We were prisoners and now we're going home. - A short distance from here is a fishing village where we can get a boat. We'll move up the coast to Los Indios, where you can get a train to the capital and I can go home. (suspenseful music) (officer speaks foreign language) - Shut the engine and get out. (gun fires) (guns fire) (tense percussive music) (gun fires) - Senor, is there a restroom around here? (man speaks foreign language) What happened was, I took one of those tours. You know, to see the jungle animals and the birds. I love animals and birds. Well anyway, we were driving and driving, no no no, don't get up, don't get up. Anyway, we were driving and my kidney, well, Daddy always said that, anyway, I had to make. (chuckles) You know, to pee? (women yell) (speaks foreign language) (man shouts in foreign language) (man speaks foreign language) (suspenseful music) - Go to the road, find Orfeo. - Halt! - [Garcia] Ah, welcome to the Los Indios! - It's senor Garcia. - Ah, a small mistake, senorita. In the jungle to those pigs only I'm Garcia. But here, to my men, to my sainted madre, to the world, I am Dubay. Major Alberto Dubay. (slap) - What's your real name, you fucking traitor? - Oh, senorita, please, your language! My men! (chuckles) Besides, you are wrong. Ronaldo Montoya is Ronaldo Montoya. That is why it was so easy to find his army record, locate his family and arrest his brothers. It wasn't until he received the letter telling of his brother's protective custody, that I obtained his assistance. But I think perhaps you play me for a fool. You was to warn me of the rebels' attack plans. - That's why I'm here. - And Aganar! What of Aganar? - There was no time to warn you! These girls, you wanted them out of the way! - No time, hm? You can put that on your brothers' gravestone. - Oh, Ronaldo! You mean you killed his brothers? - The morning after Aganar. Take him inside and lock him up. This one, take to my office. Sergeant Gomez, how early can we leave in the morning? - I can be refueled and ready to leave by 0500. - Good, we leave at 0430. (percussive music) - Listen, Major Garcia, or Dubay, or whatever your name is. - Alberto, senorita. - Look, I don't know if it's part of your national character here or what, but ever since I've arrived in this country, I've been held by people against my will. I want you to return us to San Rosario City now. Today. Or at least call the American Consul. - Senorita, in the morning I will go north with my men. And by evening, when the so-called revolution is over, I will return here and decide what to do with the four of you. - [Sue] Five, you forgot Ronaldo. - No, I did not forget Ronaldo. Ronaldo I will take back to his village and hang him there. - Hang him? Why? - In a nation like this one, it is very foolish to allow your citizens, especially your soldiers, to play revolution. - No, but he helped you. (Alberto chuckles) - But he helped me only because I forced him to. Because I was smarter than he. Senorita, I enjoy my job so much, and I'm so well suited for it. The masquerade, becoming the columnist Garcia, going to the rebel camp. Was I not clever? Finding the weak link in the chain. Ronaldo Montoya. And now, the final brilliant move. When Flavio the mouse emerges from his hiding place to steal cheese, Dubay the cat is waiting. I spring, pin him, and tear him to pieces! And then! The game is over. Well, almost over. - Padre, you must release us. - Yes, I know. Or Uncle Samuel will buy no more of our coconuts. - Then, please put me with the others! - Certainly! Please take your clothes off. - Please! (suspenseful music) - It's not fair. That I have all the fun. (thud) (Sue whines) (steam hisses) - Senorita, you cannot refuse. I must give you an examination. - I don't need an examination, I'm fine. - After you have been with that band of filth, that scum, you could have anything, I must insist. - Insist all you want, but keep away from me. - Senorita, you are forcing me to become unpleasant. Oh, yes? Oh, yes! Lock them up in there! Romero. Bring that hose here. (women whine and moan) - Let me out. - Now, you are going to... Disrobe. Alright, show the senoritas how hot the steam is. (steam hisses) (women whine) Now will you cooperate? - Go screw yourself, you pig! (steam hisses) (women whine) - Spray her, yes! (laughs) Now the one with the big chest, very good, now very good. Now the black one. (men laugh) - Okay! - Son of a bitch! - [Man] Take off the rest! (somber music) (somber music) - Senor! Senor, help! She's dying! Please, come help! (suspenseful music) (thuds) Okay! (thuds) Where's the other prisoner? Tell me! (suspenseful music) This way. - Hands up, motherfucker. (Lynn speaks foreign language) - You jerk, key! We're going back to Flavio, do you wanna come? - Yes. - Do you know how to work this thing? (guard groans) - Let's go. (fire crackles) (bell rings) (siren wails) (men yell in foreign language) - Sanchez! The prisoners, they're still inside? Get them out here! (suspenseful music) (siren wails) - Oh, Christ. - Get the other door! - Major, Major! The prisoners escaped, they set that fire! - Stupid! Let the building burn! Get all the men and search the area! Stupid! Sanchez, check those buildings! And those crops! Sergeant! Check out the lodge, quickly! (suspenseful music) - Check the other side! Major, it's gone! (explosion booms) (gun fires) - Sanchez! (gun fires) Contact the transportation depot at Ermadas, and arrange for all the trucks they have available. (gulls squawk) (boat approaches) (percussive music) (man shouts in foreign language) (Alberto speaks foreign language) One mile from Rio Tigre we stop and deploy, let's go. - (sighs) Gasoline. We're very close, we continue by foot, come. Let's go! (suspenseful music) - First I would like a photograph of me standing with my foot on the body of their leader, Flavio. - Foot. On. Flavio. - Then, one standing next to piled bodies of other guerrillas. - Other. Guerrillas. - Then how about one... (peaceful music) - Deserted. They've all gone. - I'm so exhausted. We just can't keep on walking. - Ronaldo, where could they have gone? - What about that jungle doorbell thing? - The signal. - Oh, Christ! - Ronaldo! (women whine) (suspenseful music) Oh, my god! (man laughs) (groans) (men laugh) (suspenseful music) - El Presidente. Like Alexander to Macedonia. Hannibal of the Alps. Like Custard, no, cross that one out. We are all just soldiers doing our duty. - Doing. Our-- - Duty. (suspenseful music) - Oh, Flavio. Christ, we... - I am as surprised as you are. You know the government troops headed this way? - Yeah, that's why we're here. - They're coming to attack our camp? - To ambush you as you leave. - Then they know of our attack. You told them. - Yes. - Instead of an attack, it is an ambush. Still they must cross Rio Tigre. We continue the mining. - We should also use the snipers on the other side. - Flavio, Garcia has more than 100 men, heavily armed. - Garcia? - Yes, Garcia! Your writer friend, who happens to be Major Dubay. Who raped Sue, who murdered Ronaldo's brothers. Who's leading that convoy here right now! - Look, we came back here to warn you about Garcia! - So, not only have I been a fool, perhaps I have been insane. For trusting you, Ronaldo. For not shooting all of you the first time you attempted escape! Insane to the point of having my enemy as a guest, right in my own camp! When all this is passed... When this battle is over, you shall be court-martialed, Ronaldo. - Flavio, I have nowhere to go. You have nothing to fear from me. Let me fight with you today. - I can afford no more mistakes, Ronaldo. Crao. Tie him up. - Flavio! - I need nurses today. Do you help or does Crao tie you as well? (suspenseful music) - We will move to Rio Tigre upstream from the Edos Peri. Rodriguez, you will position your men across the river on both sides of the road. When the rebels leave their camp tonight, and attempt to cross by the ferry, we on this side will begin the ambush. When they attempt to return your side, you will open fire. Any questions, no? Good. Send scouts to the river. Remember, the man who is clumsy, gets dragged back to Los Indios by his testicles. Vamos. (suspenseful music) - Take your men downstream across the river. When the shooting begins, we move in from behind. (man speaks foreign language) - You trust somebody like that? - I trust him to kill as many soldiers as he possibly can. It means that many bodies for his men to pick clean. - Pick clean? - People join revolutions for different reasons. And you, can I trust you to use this? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Rodriguez, return and send a fresh group across. Sanchez, deploy your men at the tree line on both sides of the road. (shouts in foreign language) (gun fires) (guerrilla screams) (soldier shouts in foreign language) (explosion booms) (soldier yell) (shouts in foreign language) (guns fire) (guns fire) (explosion boom) (guns fire) Rodriguez! Move your men forward! (guns fire) (soldier screams) (guns fire) (soldier groans) (guns fire) (soldier screams) - You might as well die like the rest of us, untied. (gun fires) - Find some cover. (guns fire) (Tomasa screams) (man screams) (guns fire) (soldier groans) (distant guns fire) (guns fire) - [Sue] Shoot him, Ellie! Just shoot him, shoot him! (gun fires) (soldier screams) (Ellie whines and sobs) (gun fires) (guns fire) (soldiers groan) (guns fire) (Ronaldo groans) (guns fire) (guns fire) (soldiers groan) (gun fires) (guns fire) (soldier groans) (guns fire) (soldier groans) - Rodriguez, withdraw! Withdraw, Rodriguez! (suspenseful music) (guns fire) (guns fire) (soldiers groan) (moody music) - Get them ready, Crao, we must move. Movelito, your arm still hurt? - No. - Good. Come on, help the men with the weapons. - You still don't have medical help. I could continue the training. Flavio, I believe in what you're doing, I wanna help. I'm staying. (moody guitar music) - We are almost ready, so you must leave now. Roberto. Crao, let's go quickly! (lively music) (explosion booms)
