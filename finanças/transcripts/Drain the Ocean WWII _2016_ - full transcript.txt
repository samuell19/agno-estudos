NARRATOR: These are the wrecks of World War II. Some of its greatest mysteries lie beneath the sea. Imagine if we could empty oceans, letting water drain away to reveal secrets from the deep. Now, using the latest undersea scanning technology, we can drain the oceans. For the first time, we can catch sight of answers to long-standing questions. Pearl Harbor. Who fired the first shot? Who sank the German super ship, Bismarck? D-Day. Why is there a tank battalion underwater, off the coast of France? Discover a world of drowned mysteries as never seen before... in Drain The Ocean, WWII. [hull creaking] New underwater scientific surveys pierce the deep oceans. Powerful computers turn accurate data into 3-D images. Now we can examine sunken wrecks in detail from any angle. Draining the oceans throws new light on World War II. The Pacific Ocean, scene of a devastating surprise attack on a Hawaiian island and its key American naval base, Pearl Harbor. JAMES DELGADO: Pearl Harbor was ground zero. The Japanese attack changed everything. NARRATOR: Imagine if we could pull a plug to let the waters of Pearl Harbor drain away. For the first time, we can construct a precise picture of the mighty battleship USS Arizona, the most infamous sinking on that day. Most ships sunk in the attack were brought to the surface again. Why not the Arizona? [birds squawking] Early Sunday morning, December 7th, 1941. Ships of the US Pacific fleet are in harbor. America is not at war. Unexpectedly... Japanese bombers attack. There is no warning. [explosions] That Sunday morning I heard a very loud explosion. I turned the radio on to see what was the cause of it. They said the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor. NARRATOR: In under two hours, Japanese bombing claims 2,400 lives... and destroys or damages over 300 planes and 20 ships. The battleship Arizona explodes with a deafening bang. People said if you heard that explosion, you'd never forget it. [loud explosion] [siren wails] NARRATOR: Nearly half the casualties that day were on the Arizona. WEATHERWAX: Water was on fire, and the whole area was just black with smoke. 1,177 killed. These are all young people. They went to bed and never got up. NARRATOR: Most of the fleet was salvaged and repaired to fight in the war. The Arizona remains where she sank... a memorial for visitors standing over her. She lies in shallow water. A war grave. HANS VAN TILBURG: The way the ship is settling into the mud... There are bubbles coming up, the ship is creaking and groaning. It's a little bit spooky at times. NARRATOR: After the attack, the US Navy attempted to recover all the other ships. But not the Arizona. If we could drain the sea from Pearl Harbor, would we discover why they didn't refloat this great battleship? Now, using the most recent survey data, we can drain Pearl Harbor. For the first time, we will see the drowned vessel as she is today, but this time, high and dry. The fact-based, high-resolution visualization takes us to the crumpled bow... and leads us to the answer. An armor-piercing bomb hit Arizona's forward ammunition store. It set off more than a million pounds of gunpowder. The damage is extraordinary. The force sliced her hull in two. PAWLOWSKI: Down by the forecastle, where the blast literally blew the bow off, there's a crack about as wide as my fist that starts on the edge of the vessel and goes clear down to the keel. TILBURG: The crack that runs through the entire ship and down the sides of the hull, that's major structural damage to the vessel, which is why they gave up the thought of bringing that ship up. NARRATOR: Now Pearl Harbor is drained of water, it's clear for all to see. USS Arizona remains on the bottom because the break in her hull is too big for her to be repaired or floated. As the ocean rushes away outside the harbor, the sight of another, bigger mystery is about to be uncovered... one that was poised to rewrite history. Did the Japanese really fire the first shot on December 7th, 1941? [gun blast] Over an hour before Japan's surprise attack, an American destroyer claims it fired on a Japanese submarine and sank it. If true, then the United States, not Japan, fired first in the Pacific War. The submarine vanishes. No general alarm is raised. The authorities think the crew of the USS Ward must be mistaken. The men cannot prove they hit anything. TILBURG: In those days, right before this impending conflict, there had likely been a number of false sightings. The report that the Ward made went as another potential sighting that they couldn't follow up on. NARRATOR: Did the Ward sink an enemy submarine over an hour before the shock attack? The only way to be sure is to find that sub. NARRATOR: In the '90s, submersible pilot Terry Kerby set out to find the submarine. TERRY KERBY: There it is. NARRATOR: For his team from the Hawaii Undersea Research Lab, the mission turned into a marathon. Luckily, their high-tech craft can dive deep. KERBY: Pisces V is capable of diving to 2,000 meters and a normal dive usually lasts about eight hours. You usually launch at 8:00 in the morning and it's back on deck by 5:00 p.m. NARRATOR: The hunt for a Japanese sub supposedly sunk over an hour before the air attack on Pearl Harbor proved harder than expected. CHRISTOPHER KELLEY: What we found was that there was a great deal of objects that could have been the submarine. We actually wound up with something like 37 different possible targets that could be the Ward midget sub. [indistinct radio chatter] NARRATOR: Terry had no accurate position data from 1941, but war records confirm two-man Japanese mini subs were secretly trying to sneak into Pearl Harbor. DELGADO: The idea was to launch them as if they were tiny, little hornets buzzing out of a nest. Carrying two torpedoes, they could dart in and out of a main battle line, fire their torpedoes, come back, recharge their batteries, be reloaded and go and fight again. NARRATOR: Months turned into years. Did USS Ward truly hit a Japanese submarine? Eventually, evidence looms into sight. [inaudible radio chatter] About 30 meters north of the target. KERBY: That was an exciting day. After ten years, finally coming across and in perfect condition. It just connects you with that history. KELLEY: When we found it, it was just elation and then the next part was there's two people inside of it. Then it became a little bit... more emotional, just thinking about what had happened and what their final moments were like. NARRATOR: Is this the sub they've been looking for? Silt on the sea floor is easily disturbed. Only glimpses of the sub are seen. If we could drain the sea outside Pearl Harbor... could we see the submarine in precise detail and cast light on evidence confirming the Ward's claim? Now, combining the very latest visual video and sonar data... we can pull the plug on the Pacific Ocean. We can view Terry's find from any angle. We can examine it in unexpected detail. After decades on the bottom, the Japanese midget sub is amazingly intact. And on its right side, there's a four-inch hole... exactly where the American destroyer Ward reported hitting her. This remarkable discovery settles the argument. KELLEY: We could confirm to the Ward survivors that they did indeed sink that submarine, which was very, very important. That submarine would have probably gotten into the harbor if they hadn't sunk it. That was the first shot fired in anger by the United States in the Pacific War and it sank that midget sub in more than 1,000 feet of water. NARRATOR: The US Navy did engage a hostile sub off Pearl Harbor over an hour before the first bombs fell. Yet no alarm was raised on the island. After the war, the US Congress found the attack on the sub should have been recognized as the immediate basis for an all-out alert. DELGADO: To what extent would the United States Armed Forces have been able to respond is hard to say. People would hope they would. NARRATOR: Japan's shock assault on Pearl Harbor changes the direction of World War II. Its ally, Germany, declares war on the USA. More ships are sunk. If we were able to peel back the layers of water and drain the Atlantic Ocean, we would discover the German battleship, Bismarck, built to be unsinkable. ERIC GROVE: Bismarck was designed to take hits, but sinking her was another matter altogether. NARRATOR: Draining Bismarck for the first time sheds light on the question, "What sank Germany's largest battleship?" At launch, Bismarck is Germany's biggest ever warship. Her crew numbers over 2,000 men. Eight massive, 15-inch guns can fire shells weighing almost a ton 24 miles. Her first mission, destroy British convoys in the Atlantic. [horn blows] May 24th, 1941... HMS Hood, pride of Britain's Royal Navy, launches an attack on the Bismarck. Western Approaches Command, Britain's secret naval center, plots the battle. GROVE: This took place in the Denmark Strait here, as the German ships were coming out of this passage between Greenland and Iceland. Bismarck fires very accurately, the Hood is hit in one of her Achilles' heel areas, her magazine blows up... In fact, she blows up virtually from end to end. NARRATOR: Hood's crew of 1,418 men are all killed, save three. The loss of the Royal Navy's iconic warship reaches British Prime Minister Churchill. His order goes out... "Sink the Bismarck." The Royal Navy would not let her get away. NARRATOR: Over 50 British warships race after her. Bismarck finishes almost 16,000 feet down. She was hit many, many times. If you look at the wreck today, the number of holes in that wreck is quite remarkable. NARRATOR: If we could drain the ocean, would we see what finally sank the ship that was meant to be unsinkable? NARRATOR: Today, state-of-the-art underwater surveys allow us to pull the plug on the ocean and drain the Atlantic itself. Trillions of gallons of seawater disappear to reveal long-hidden secrets. For the first time, we expose Bismarck lying three miles down. Seeing her in this unique light uncovers an astonishing question. Did the British send her to the sea floor? Or did the Germans sink their own ship? May 26th, 1941. The British have been desperately searching for Bismarck. Finally, planes from aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal get her in their sights. They attack with torpedoes. One makes a lucky strike. GROVE: It hit on the stern, the very weak point of even the most powerfully apt battleship. NARRATOR: Now Bismarck's wreck is plain to see, we can examine in forensic detail the torpedoes' crippling blow. One of Bismarck's two rudders is buckled, damaging the steering gear. The other rudder is blown off altogether. Unable to steer, there is no escape as the British fleet close in for the kill. JURENS:: The captain knew within five minutes, if he didn't have rudders, he was in big trouble. GROVE: She was very much a sitting duck. The British are able to open fire on her and they just keep hitting her. NARRATOR: In the clear light of day, for the first time in over 70 years, Bismarck's damage can be seen by all. Relentless British shelling destroys her guns and crew. More torpedoes hit... tearing into sections of the hull. Parts of the ship begin to fill with water. JURENS: The ones that really hurt were the larger ones from the surface ships. They made fairly substantial holes and probably significant flooding in. [gun blast] NARRATOR: After constant attack from dusk till dawn, the unsinkable Bismarck goes down. Her sinking starts a controversy. GROVE: The classic question about the sinking of the Bismarck is, did British sink her or did her own crew sink her? Was she scuttled or was she sunk? NARRATOR: If Bismarck was sunk solely by British shells, water would only flood the areas they hit. As Bismarck went down, undamaged sections full of air would collapse under pressure. Her hull would soon crush. But the true-to-life data-based visualization shows Bismarck isn't crushed. There were no large pockets of air. Careful examination reveals torpedo damage weakened some hull plates. Water inside the ship burst more plates outwards when she hit the sea floor. Evidence Bismarck was completely flooded. Her crew had deliberately let in water. They helped sink their own ship. JURENS: The crew really had no choice whatsoever. They were going to be faced with an action where they were going to be sunk by the Royal Navy. GROVE: They knew they were going to die. The only thing they could do honorably, other than surrender which wasn't honorable, was to sink themselves, so they completed the process. Both sides can take a certain amount of pride, I think, in this. She was scuttled and she was sunk, together. NARRATOR: The Germans turn to more secret operations. World War II's battle of the Atlantic grows fiercer. Along America's east coast, hundreds of American wrecks sunk by Germany scatter the seabed. JOE HOYT: This is an American battlefield. It's right in our backyard and it's really not well-known. NARRATOR: How did the enemy mount secret attacks 3,000 miles from German bases? To answer this, we drain the seas off North Carolina. Cape Hatteras, on the USA's Eastern Seaboard. Coastal merchantmen travel along shipping lanes close to shore. In early 1942, this area attracted Nazi U-boats in search of easy targets. DELGADO: It was a spot where, because of shoals, ships would have to slow down and, as large amounts of traffic moved during World War II, it was a point well-known to the Germans, where they could congregate, wait and just start shooting. NARRATOR: Today, maritime archaeologist Joe Hoyt searches for the many ships the U-boats sank. His side-scan sonar maps the seabed. Overhead one time. HOYT: Basically, what this is, is there's two channels on either side. These are transducers that are sending out an active sonar sound wave and creating an image of the bottom. Right now, we're gonna go off the back deck, we're gonna deploy it in the water, pay it out, let it settle out behind the boat so it can actually start running the survey. All right, let's start paying out, pay out. NARRATOR: The survey is searching for evidence over 70 years old. The sonar penetrates right to the bottom of the shipping lanes. Now we're set up, it's collecting data. So right now we're seeing this is an actual image of the seabed and as you can, there's not much here. It can be tedious, but it all pays off when you come across something that you've never seen before. Rudder at midships. NARRATOR: Joe's detailed survey will allow us to peel back the water, revealing how U-boats sank so many ships without being caught. Imagine pulling the plug on the ocean. The waves of the US East Coast drain away. Vanishing waters expose a ship sunk by a German U-boat. After more than 70 years on the seabed, she is brought into the light of day. This is the Dixie Arrow, an unarmed merchant vessel. Her cargo, 86,000 barrels of oil. A crew of 33. This unique photograph shows her after being torpedoed. Eleven men died. Dixie Arrow was one of many. In six months, German U-boats sank nearly 400 ships off the east coast of the US. [explosions] Twenty-five off Cape Hatteras alone. They took roughly 5,000 lives. HOYT: The first ships started sinking in January of 1942. There was a large, four-month window period where it was just annihilation. NARRATOR: Accurate sonar data allows draining to continue along the coast. It exposes a German submarine... U-701. We can see her as she is on the seabed for the first time. This sub alone sank or damaged nine ships in under two weeks. How did U-boats manage to attack so many vessels without being caught? Most Americans weren't even aware of the fact that the enemy was literally just off the beach. NARRATOR: To prevent panic, authorities banned news of attacks on America's doorstep. They didn't order blackouts. At night, lighthouses and town lights gave U-boats a clear view of ships. DELGADO: The Germans remarked they could see the ships silhouetted in the offshore lights, making it very easy to just simply start mowing them down. NARRATOR: For six months, the U-boats continued their attacks. HOYT: You've got oil washing up on the beach. In some instances, there's actual bodies. It really had an enormous impact, not only on the materials that were being moved, but in the psyche of the Americans on the home front. NARRATOR: Only by luck were U-boats ever found and sunk in the shallow coastal waters by day. The disappearing waters reveal the U-boat's secret. They used the geography of America itself. Off Cape Hatteras, the sea bottom drops away sharply, close to the coast. Germans could quickly run to hide in the deeper ocean. HOYT: The U-boats would hunt all night, and as sunrise came, they would move out into deeper water, where they could remain safe from counterattack during the day. NARRATOR: Eventually, the US Navy mobilized coastal air patrols, ending the threat to merchant shipping. On July 7th, 1942, U-701 was attacked by a plane. Of its 43-man crew, only seven survived. World War II escalates as the US joins the fight to liberate mainland Europe in the largest amphibious invasion in history. DELGADO: The fierce fighting left an incredible record on the bottom. It is a vast battlefield lying just off those beaches. NARRATOR: Three miles off the coast of Northern France, our data-based visualization of the sea floor uncovers tanks ready for battle. Why are tanks out at sea? By June 1944, Southwick House in England is the scene of intense planning. The Royal Navy's lead historian studies the most ambitious invasion of World War II, known as D-Day, masterminded within these walls. STEPHEN PRINCE: That is the actual map that was looked at by Eisenhower and all the Allied commanders in this very room, the operations room for D-Day. There are five channels and that is the channels that are safe for the invasion forces to go through. [siren wails] NARRATOR: 5,000 Allied ships carry men and machines towards Normandy. It's the biggest armada in history. To defeat the Germans in Europe, the invasion must have access to France. Seas are rough. Beaches are heavily defended. [explosions and automatic gunfire] Since World War II, the sea of the D-Day landing beaches has attracted marine archaeologists. Chris Howlett is the former head of the UK's Seabed Data Center. Specialists in underwater mapping. He took part in a survey of 50 miles of Normandy coastline. The results were more than he expected. [electronic beeping] HOWLETT: Within that area, we found about 600 targets, if you like. 600 objects on the sea floor. 600 targets is probably ten times what you would kind of expect on a normal coast. NARRATOR: Most surprisingly, they discovered a tank battalion. Why are there tanks on the seabed off the coast of France? NARRATOR: Today's latest scientific surveys uncover secrets beneath the sea in a totally new way. Processing data from two-and-a-half miles off D-Day invasion zone, Omaha Beach, the water is peeled back... to reveal a most unexpected wreck... an American tank. A Sherman from the US 741st Tank Battalion. Its 75-millimeter gun faces forward, ready to fire. This tank never joined the battle for the beach. And it's not alone. Other tanks lie in a cluster nearby. HOWLETT: The cluster's probably about a kilometer across. To find 20 or 30 tanks in such a confined area is actually quite an amazing event. NARRATOR: Most of the tanks are upright. None seem to have been hit by shells. Tanks were sent to help infantry take the beach. Why are these out at sea? Close examination of the images shows these are no ordinary Sherman tanks. They have a surprising modification. Between the tracks are two propellers. These tanks can swim. PRINCE: You've got these two strange propellers driving off a cog system at the back and they also have a large canvas screen that is put around the tank and that traps enough air to just about give the tank positive buoyancy. NARRATOR: Mechanical arms support a waterproof screen, or skirt, around the tank. Now, this 33-ton tank can float. Footage of secret trials proves the amphibious Shermans can cross smooth water. They will travel over the English Channel on special ships like this one, a tank landing craft. Unusually, the tanks were to deploy two miles out at sea. PRINCE: The captain of the ship would attempt to turn his stern into the weather, so that he was trying to create a small patch of as calm as possible water in front of the ramp. The ramp would have to be lowered and then the first tank would have to drive off into the water. ROBERT NEYLAND: Just the craziest idea that you could all of a sudden put a big skirt around a tank and propellers on it and it could make its way like a boat to shore. NARRATOR: So what goes wrong? Now the sea has been digitally removed, we find the amphibious tanks in a line, stretching from their launch position towards Omaha Beach. It was not gunfire that sank these tanks. It was high waves. PRINCE: Effectively, they've got roughly around two feet's worth of clearance. The waves on D-Day, anything up to sometimes three or four feet. NARRATOR: Water floods the tanks. Twenty-seven out of 29 sink. PRINCE: That's where you end up with the pattern of wrecks that we see on the seabed, where the tanks have been lost, either at launch or as they foundered on their way in. NARRATOR: The loss of the tanks contributes to the over 3,700 casualties on Omaha Beach that day. D-Day itself is a triumph. The Allied forces seize the beaches. Now they need to advance inland. Reinforcements are ferried from Britain to Europe. Draining the sea further along the coast reveals the tragic story of one of the troop ships. DELGADO: In a big ship full of guys, when something bad happens, it's epic. NARRATOR: 400 American soldiers drown as this ship sinks. With the water gone, a question arises. Was there anything that could have saved them? NARRATOR: Winter, 1944. Six months after D-Day. The Belgian troopship, Leopoldville, leaves Southampton, England. She's carrying over 2,200 young American soldiers to France. PRINCE: These are troops of a division that hasn't fought before. The majority of them would be in their early 20s, so the absolute vast majority of them will have had no experience of combat. NARRATOR: The Leopoldville never made it. Around a third of those onboard died. Today, her wreck lies just north of Cherbourg, Leopoldville's destination. 400 US soldiers drowned only five miles from shore. Why weren't more saved? Early evening, December 24th. The Belgian captain and crew have Leopoldville within sight of land. [explosion] A German U-boat torpedoes the ship, killing at least 300 men. The remaining 1,800 US soldiers scramble on deck to await orders. A British escort ship rescues about half the survivors. The rest wait for help from the harbor nearby. WILLIAM BOGGS: We expected somebody to come out and take the thing into tow. We just stood there in our ranks, waiting for somebody to tell us to do something. [explosion] NARRATOR: A second explosion rocks the ship. It begins to sink. The captain orders "Abandon ship." His Belgian crew board the lifeboats. The US soldiers do not understand what to do. PRINCE: There definitely is a level of confusion amongst the crew and the US troops about the decision to abandon ship. JOHN VITALI: We had no instructions aboard ship. Nothing that would aid in survival. NARRATOR: As the Leopoldville sinks, the young American soldiers have no choice but to leap into the freezing water. 400 men drown before rescue arrives. Survivors claim many died needlessly. Will draining the sea from the Leopoldville shed light on their story? As the waters disappear, a dark secret is revealed. The crew took the lifeboats, but now, exposed for all to see, unused life rafts called Carley floats. Each simple float could take a dozen men as soon as they're released. Few were released. The soldiers didn't know how to use them. Still attached to the ship, they couldn't save anyone. BOGGS: 300 to 350 were killed by the torpedo. The rest didn't have to die. DELGADO: Sometimes what you see on the bottom... is heartbreaking. NARRATOR: Their sacrifice is not in vain. Others finished their mission. In May 1945, World War II in Europe ends. Freedom returns. Today, thousands of wrecks remain beneath the waves... silent witness to the struggle and slaughter of the past. Memorials to a generation that gave us their lives. Captioned by Pixel Logic Media
