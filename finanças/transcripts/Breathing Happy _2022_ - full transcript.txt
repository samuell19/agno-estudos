No more drugs no more booze (laughing) - We had to do something before you skip town, - So this is, congratulations, good luck, and Christmas, all in one! (laughing softly) (dark music humming) - Hello? - Come on, say something. - [Tristan] Speech, speech! - [Tristan] Who works at an ice rink in Florida?! - Psychopaths. - meth-heads - Yeah, drug addicts. - [Lotus] Everything is going to be all right. Breathe. You are in control of your breath and your life. Remember you are exactly where you need to be. Allow all of the thoughts and burdens of the world to be free from your mind. Remember. (hockey stick slapping) - [Lotus] Even if your thoughts wander that's okay too. (fist pounding on door) - [Lotus] Just focus on your breath. In. (wailing) (exhales) And out. In. And out. (slowly) Keep breathing slowly like this. Fully empty your lungs with each breath. You are in control- (hockey air horn blares) (sirens wailing) (hockey air horn gets louder) (sounds stop abruptly) (water pouring) (glass clinks) - Hey, Angel, Angel, Angel. Come here. Come here. (cicadas) Babies, babies, babies. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi, come here. Come here. Come on. Come on. (door sliding) (faucet water dripping) (gargling) (lonely music) (water running) - Okay. You ready? Here we go. Okay, wanna get a treat? (baby voice) That's a girl. Oh, that's delicious, thank you. Well, it's Christmas Eve, couple hours away from being one year sober. And it's also gonna be my first Christmas... Without, um... Yeah, fuck it. You wanna go watch a show about lions and shit? - [TV Narrator] It's been days since the lions have found water and time, is running- - [Elf #1] Aww Jingle bells - I guess I'll be alone this Christmas... - [Elf #2] No you won't! We can spend it together. Christmas can be saved! - [Unison] Yay! - You don't even give a shit. - [Mike Flanagan] Looks like they WON'T be home alone this Christmas. - [TV Dad] Kids. I'm home. - [Kids] Daddy! - [M Flanman] Fly with Speed Fast Airlines and go higher than ever before. - Let me see this girl. (lonely music) - Ready to go to bed? - [Voicemail] Hey, you've reached Briana, leave a message and I'll get right back to you, ciao! - Hey it's Dylan, I just wanted to call and say Merry Christmas. I'm at one year sober today and uh... well, I don't know. Technically I didn't, I'm not gonna get it for like another hour and 40 minutes, but even I can't fuck that up. Right? I miss you guys. Merry Christmas. - [Voicemail] You have no new messages. To listen to your old messages from people that you have pushed away, please press- (beep) Hi baby boy it's mom. Just calling to see how your day is going. Love you. - I miss you, man. I've been meaning to reach out. I want to hear what's going on with you- - Hey it's Tristan, dude, I just saw your story and - and you made and extra tray of "fuck it" nachos-- - Dude pick up the fucking phone for once- - There's not enough time to profess all my love - (voicemails and beeps blend together) - Hello? Are you coming over for dinner or not? (voicemails and beeps get louder) (impossible to hear one voice over another ) (thudding gets louder and faster) - [Briana's Voicemail] Dylan? Seriously? - If you don't call me back I'm calling the cops - - to do a wellness check on your ass - (someone arguing angrily mixed with thuds) (sounds fade out except for telephone beep) (cicadas buzzing) (house creaks) (weird noises) (door opening) (house alarm goes off) (phone alarm) - Angel? Angel? Angel! (house alarm continues) What the- What the fuck? Angel? (house alarm turns off) (smoke alarm) (otherworldly music) (house alarm goes off again) Hey, Hey! Fucking' try me asshole! Hey, the fucking cops are on their way! You piece of shit- (house alarm turns off) Angel, where'd you go? Angel? Where'd you go? (tense music) (phone ringing) (loud crash) (house alarm blares!) (crashing) - What the fuck? (calm Christmas music) - Mm, that's fucking delicious Ah. Oh, that is good. I know my way around the kitchen. - Agh! - Ho Ho Ho! - Ho Ho Ho. Merry Christmas. - Marshall? - Weird, huh? - What is this? - I'm here to celebrate with you. You did it. You made it a year, buddy. If there was ever a time to spike the eggnog, this is it. - No it's- I am not your buddy and I'm not- - I'm here because I care! I don't see anybody else celebrating. You don't care you're my dealer - - I'm your ex dealer. And we were pretty good friends for a while too. All that's in the past. I'm here today as like your shamanic therapist that wants to guide you on a journey of realization because you've been going through a lot. - No, I'm, I'm getting outta here, how. - [Scary Voices] Dylan, dylan! - You're denying help right now. And that's textbook addict behavior. (voices echoing) Dylan, you're sick. You're sad. And you need help. Let me help you. Why don't we just dip our toes in. Fire up a backwoods. Middle school shit. (cackling) I'm not- I'm not touching anything that you give me. - Well we're going to need something to take the edge off because we have a Herculean amount of duct tape to peel off therapy-wise. One death is a lot an entire family? That's some Holocaust shit. And I don't say that lightly, I know you're not supposed to joke about the Holocaust because it didn't happen. But I stand by my metaphor. Because what you've been going through has to be unfathomable, recovering pill-head or not. (loud knocking) Good news is you got the same backstory as the Punisher and he's my all time favorite comic book character. I mean there is nothing more badass than losing your entire family and continuing to fight the good fight. Okay, I'm picking up vibes like you don't want to be here right now. I get it. There's a key. Anytime you want, you just let yourself back in. (echoing) I'm always here for buddy. You know that. But but but- Wait wait wait- before I forget... your Christmas present! we got two goodie bags for you to choose from. In this hand, we got The Great Green Glorious Goodie Bag of Glee. It's full of herbal tea and mint flavored dental floss. You choose this bag, you can wake up Christmas morning like none of this ever happened and you can continue being a Sober Sally. You know what we have in this hand? In this hand, we have the Rip Roaring' Red Bag of Rooby Dooby-Doo Snackie Poos and- wait, wait, what, what did I put in here again? some Oxy Cottontail, icy shards of crystal meth in case you want to stay up way up past your bedtime. (echoing) Some Xanax in case you need to hop a flight to Zanzibar, smooth things out for a little while. And I got some super special mushroom chocolate the psilocybin is powderized, extracted, blended with reishi and cordyceps, this is special designer shit- This is the Tesla of psychedelics. You choose this bag, You'll be riding the short bus to hallucination station! Woo-woo! - This is not cool. - Yeah, no, I know. Just pick a color red, or green- All right let's cut the bullshit here, I've been talking a lot. I tend to do that. What do you want? What do you want? - I wanna stay clean, but it is a fucking struggle. And you show up here- - All right, well maybe move outta' your dead family's vacation house ya weirdo, you already trashed one house. - You know what give me this fucking bag. (laughing) Oh man. I didn't think you'd actually fall for that. They're both drug. It's always the same result with you, no matter your intentions. You know that. You have a disease. You're like a kid with bone cancer, except nobody wants to make your wish. (distorted) Was that mean of me? Making you think you had a choice? - People think freedom is like freedom to do whatever you want. When in fact freedom is, you know, choosing not to harm yourself or others. - Did you learn that when you became my sponsor or are you just listening to Russell Brand's Instagram too much? - It's a little bit of both. Fuck. (video game noises) Can you re-spawn me? - Can I re-spawn you? No, you have re-spawn yourself and I... - Oh! - Hi. Is that for me? - Oh yeah, sure. - I love these things. - Well this is new. - Yeah, it's an RPG. - Is it any good? - No. Same old shit. Predictable. - Hey, have you seen Angel? - Dude, don't do that. You've already been through enough, okay? You don't deserve that. Fuck! I had to tell you somethi- - Ah! (laughing) The door wants to talk to you. - Huh? - The weird-ass door that popped outta' nowhere? it fuckin' wants to talk to you. - Wait what? THE DOOR! The door, the weird-ass door that popped- (booming laughter) - It's I, THE GOLDEN DOOR! - Oh, dang. - Wait, wait, hey. Am I in trouble? - Fuck Fuck Fuuuck. - What do you mean fuck? - I dunno. I, I don't know. - You don't know? (loud rap music from room) - You've been good, right? Yeah I've been good I haven't done anything for a year so like- - (laughing) I'm so glad I'm not you. No, you should be fine. You should be fine, you should be fine. Motherfucker! Ah! I hate this shit, I hate this shit. Motherfucker. It's not fair! Every time I try to do this shit it does the same old thing. I have to shit. (eerie music) Hey... HEY! Don't do it champ. Is that smart? Have you thought this through? Should I not, open... you? - No, you definitely should. Not open me. I just need to, before you reach the handle. Okay. Yes. Open me. I will walk... I will walk you through what to do so that you can walk through you with it, through me, you and me we will walk through this together. I'll walk you through- - (no) Mmm, mmm! - Sorry, do I, do I not open you? Do I open you? What do I do? - Okey dokey champ, let's try this one more time. This is gonna be simple. You just gotta listen to instructions and just stand there and sit down. - What? - SIT DOWN!!!! (eerie Christmas music) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, Dylan. I am Santa Door! I love Christmas. Don't you? (music stops) (tape hiss) (soft chimes) - [Dad] What do I press? (laughing) - like the dumb leading the blind here... - Dylan, get in here! - Dylan! - [Young Dylan] What? - What do mean, what? Come here! - [Young Dylan] I'm playing my game. - You know today is? - Mm, no. Should I? - Today is your day. - Oh-kay... - Come on, open it. - All right. - You gonna say anything? - I, I've done this. I've heard this before. - Not from us. - I'm gonna be adopted?! (video fastforwards) - Okay, this is our first official family video. - Yeah! - So don't blow it. Okay, here we go. - Let's hope he doesn't regret this, okay? - You probably will. - [Dad] All right everybody- - [Dad] Briana, let go of one of those amazing farts that you know, you're known for. Come on now! - Dad, nice hat! - This is an untraditional Christmas family, so- - Hey dad? Dad. - Yeah? - Do we keep lighting this candle thing or is that done now? - [Dad] That's a menorah and that one, we actually don't light. We pour oil into the middle one, but we're past that now. - Oh, okay. - [Dad] Yeah. Good job though, good job. - Thanks. - [Dad] How's it going? I keep meaning to ask like, why do you guys celebrate every holiday, but aren't- - Shh, Shh! If you shut up. You get more presents. - You know what you're- - [Dad] Yeah, you'll figure it out. - [Dad] Mom's been sipping the egg nog. - [Mom] Don't tell them that! (everyone laughing) Can I have a sip? (tape clicks) - What you watching? - I was watching my adoption tape, but now I've just been watching like 10 minutes of us asleep on Christmas as kids. You wanna see? - Yeah. Little nuggets. (sink running) You know, back before everybody had a camera in their pocket, Dad was the one documenting everything. He would've loved today's social media shit show. - Isn't it so funny how like, this has huge sentimental value. But now that we take photos and videos like 20, 30 times a day, it's like, who cares? - You know, that was your dad's favorite video. - Wait, this one us sleeping? - Mhmm, he used to say there was nothing better than seeing you all to sleep warm blankets, full belly. Safe. He would say that that's some Mr. Rogers shit. Oh, you know, you know that I'm faking being asleep here? - Mm, you faking it? - Yeah. I'm faking it. Okay, so like I'm laying there, my mind's going berserk because my mind's always going berserk. And you know, every Christmas before this was awful. I mean, you know, but this one was peaceful. This was my first peaceful Christmas ever. Thank you for that by the way. And I, you know, out the corner of my eye I see dad's cleaning, he's cleaning everything. Right? Like the food, the wrapping paper, the dishes, the whole mountain of dishes. And he's happy. Like he's humming, right? Like he's singing while cleaning. And I had this impulse to help him, and I don't know, I just didn't. I don't know why. I regret it, actually. It makes me sad. - That's a silly thing to feel sad about. Your dad loves cleaning, you know that. I know he loved cleaning, but like, I could've helped the guy, you know what I mean? - Aw. - You will always be that little kid to me. No matter how big you get, you will always be this big. - The beard isn't throwing you off at all? - Nope, you were a cute kid. - You know what sucks right now? I'm realizing that I, I don't know grandma's name. - You know your grandmother's name. - I know, I know it. Like I know it's in my brain somewhere, but I don't, I mean, like tell me a story about her. I want to know. - Ah it's... It's impossible. It's like, the of smell popcorn. How do you describe that to somebody who's never had it? - Okay, well that's a great example because if grandma was anything like popcorn, then she must have been a badass. - Oh popcorn is badass? Yeah, of course popcorn's badass. - Okay. She was my best friend. My very best friend. When she died, my life ended. Felt like it anyway. - Oh wait, was her name Beady? - Her name was Dolores. - Ah, yes. We called her Beady because she had beady little eyes. Grandpa's nickname for her. Ah, Nope. Too painful. Just like how you can't... NONE of us can talk about your father without crumbling. - Oh that is fair as shit. - Ugh. - Yuh. Why does dying have to be such a sad thing? Like why can't it be a happy thing? Like when I die, I hope people party, man. I want people to tell stories about me, like how cool I was and... Come on, just tell me one thing, like one unique thing about grandma. I don't know anything about grandma. Like did she smoke? Did she have her ears pierced? Okay Okay Okay. - [Briana] Oh, look what I find? - Drunk and drugged out of his mind per usual. Hey big bro. This is going straight to your probation officer. Look at your fucking eyes. - Hey, good, you're all dead to me anyways. - Oh, we're dead to you? - I sat him outside, do you want me to go talk to him, do you want both of us to go talk to him? What do you wanna do? - Can you just, you handle him first. - Let me make some tea to calm the fuck down. - I'm going to kill him. - Are we gonna have another Christmas with the cops or- - Shut up Lilly. - I don't think that is helpful right now- - Your brother is killing himself. - I'm gonna go outside now. - Okay but I was seriously joking. Oh my God, you need to relax You do this every fucking time. - Thanks. - I'm gonna be very calm. I'm CHOOSING to be calm. The first words out of your mouth are gonna be what drugs you took today. - What? I didn't fucking take anything, so I don't know what you want. - Try again. - I smoked some spice a couple hours ago. - Try again. - I smoked some spice, like two hours ago. It's legal for Christ's sake. - Spice wears off in like 20 minutes. - I took an Advil PM. I, I was gonna take a nap earlier. So I took like one or two Advil PMs. - Cool, so you're only two lies in. You haven't deflected like crazy yet. So whose fault is it this time, Huh? Who are you gonna blame this time, Huh? - It's okay. What did we say about Christmas? Hmm? We said that if you brought drugs into this house or if you were high around the kids, then no questions asked, we were calling the police. Did we not have a huge agreement on that? - [Dylan] I fucked up. I'm really sorry. I broke off a baby piece of Xanax. - Okay. Where did you get Xanax? - Lilly gave it to me. - Lilly, Lilly gave you Xanax. Why the fuck would Lilly give you Xanax? Lilly loves Xanax. If she had Xanax, she'd be fucking high on Xanax right now. - Whatever. I don't give a fuck anymore, all right? Nobody gets it. - Especially you, everyone just yells. - Stop. Okay. Fucking stop. I understand, okay? You smell like shit, you look like shit. Are you listening? Hey, listen to me. We said no drugs. You said yes, drugs. So now you can't be here. God, you sometimes I think you forget that I have been exactly where you are. - Look, I'm not even invited Christmas Eve for my family but it's okay because once I'm gone- - You don't get it. - Everyone can shut- - You don't get it, you don't get it! You're not invited- Shut the fuck up, okay? You are not invited where children are. Do you understand that? Because you've proven time and- - time and time again. You're just gonna get fucked up and ruin the holiday. Like right now you're getting fucked up and ruining the holiday. - Oh like you're one to talk. It was a moment of weakness. But everybody just yells at me. I know what I need, I need a positive support system and your pigtails are bullshit. You don't even know how to fucking tie little loop-de-doops. - I happen to think-- - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - You laughed, I'm off the hook. Fuck you. - You fucking suck dude. - Knock knock. - interrupting Turtle. - Why did the chicken cross the- - No, knock knock. - Who's there? - Interrupting turtle. - I just wanna- - You have to say interrupting turtle who. - Interrupting turtle who? Oh my God, what are you doing? Nope. - Gotcha. - Okay, cool. (Christmas Phone Alarm) It's officially midnight. Merry Christmas. - Yeah, let me, let me put 500 pounds on your chest and push it on you and yell at you instead of giving you a spot and you'll know has this fucking feels. - No, Dylan, Dylan you've had nothing but help. - You've had nothing but help. The rehab people say that if we keep babying you, we bury you, right? Isn't that what they say? - Yeah. - If I let you back into that house, you don't learn. This may very well have been your fix it or fuck it moment. This was your chance to prove that you could be a part of this family again. And YOU decided to say fuck it. Not me, YOU chose this shit. And now I have to sound like a fucking broken record player because we keep having the same conversation over and over again, and... Is he asleep right now? Are you fucking sleeping right now? - There's no point in us doing this right now, okay? - I hope you're ODing right now. Do us all a favor, you fucking embarrassment. - Hey! That's not gonna happen. - Wake up! Wake up! - Briana! - Wake up, wake up, wake up! (Camera clicks) - Well. Crap. - I know you're high right now. - Oh Christ mom, come on- - Don't. Why can't you stop? (emotional music) (whispering) Okay. Okay. - Mom? Am I in trouble, or...? - Give. Unplug it. When you are one year sober. When you are present, pun intended, you're gonna open this and we will watch it together. And I will tell you stories about my mom and dad. And not make it a sad thing. Deal? (kettle whistling) (echo) Try again. (dreamlike music) (music stops) (high pitched whining) - (echoing) Try again. Try again. - Let's try this one more time. I'm a talking door, all right? Alright? I'm a flipping' talking door and I just materialized in the middle of your living room. So you tell me... Does that sound like safety or danger? Are you in safety or danger Dylan? - I've got a knife. - Oh yeah, it's gonna be a lot harder for me, a magic door, to bend time and tie you up with Christmas lights now that you have a knife. Look, I can't promise anything, but I CAN promise you something I will never hurt you. Ugly Jesus. - All right, well now I'm nervous so I'm bringing the knife. Yeah kiddo you would be stupid not to bring a knife. Come on bruiser, you got this you big old burger, come on. Agh! You dirty dog, that's my PEE PEE! - Open up. Come on. - No, you need the key code. - Open up, come on. - No, you need a key code. - Key, what? - A key code. - The drug guy, he told you about the key code, right? - There's a key. - You know that. Cool. - Honestly, I wish somebody was helping me with all of this- (high-pitched voice yelling frantically) - It's kind difficult all alone getting the basics across... Agh my fucking alarm didn't go off... Am I late?! Do you need me now? Cuz this is where I come in, right? To help? The Mystery Door! - Hey. - I'm here! I got here! - Hey, good morning. - Oh okay now, am I needed now? - No, I'm good, I got it, I got it over here, thank you. - You need me say, you need me. I'm just telling this dude - - I'm here to help. - Didn't your dude obviously hold out a key for him to unlock - Oh look at me, I'm ready, I'm ready! - No, that door opened on its own. - Ah, come on, you narc. - Oh yeah, dude, it was nuts. I woke up, the whole house is shaking to shit. There's an earthquake, like the lights are going crazy. All these fucking doors were open. Okay dude, between you and me? I want one hundred percent thought I was getting abducted by aliens. - There are no earthquakes in Florida. There are no fault lines in Florida. I know that Florida doesn't have earthquakes. I'm just saying that like everything was- - There was an earthquake in 1792 at 12:58 PM, so... - Hm, 1792. She's right, yeah. - Yeah, yeah yeah! - Hey big guy, if we're gonna do this, you just gotta be straight with me. It makes you look bad when you lie and when you look bad I look bad. - This is what happened. - Maybe we should just huddle up - I'm just saying. All right... I don't... - Alright my boy, you used a key code to get through her -- - I backed into the door and it opened on its own. I don't know what... do you wanna chime in here? - My bad? - See? See what I'm dealing with. - Hey, Mystery Door. You forget to lock yourself up? You did, didn't you? Yeah... My bad. - So where we're at is that you let low budget Bradley Cooper open a magic door without a key- - Hey, are you talking shit about me over there? - Which makes him now believe that he doesn't need a key code- - 'Feck off I did it half right. - And I want to express to you that that makes me feel upset. - I'm feeling upset because- - I said my bad. - I was spending a long time - - Look Goldie, I said my bad. - I'm kind of high, so my order of operations is all wonkly doodles, you know? - Kind of high? - Oh 'feck off, I did a half right! I thought the magic door was gonna open like magic. You know like how magic works? Or I don't know, do I need to say Open Sesame? - Do I look like a lamp to you? I'm a fecking door. Plus my guy got him to take a baggie and made a huge point to like give him a key. - [Marshall] If it helps, yeah, I gave him a key, but I didn't make a huge thing about it. - Wait hold on, you... You gave me a key, but you don't have a handle. What's the point of giving me a key if you don't have a handle? - Why am I not surprised, forgot to give yourself a handle? - Feck off, ya know?! - And hey I did not take anything all right, I got tricked. - (mockingly) Officer, bro. I swear I got tricked man. [Lotus] - Perhaps I can help. Deflecting is not the path Dylan. Own up to this. There's a process to this. - There is a process. - I bet you think you can please your old lady without foreplay too? - That is a very good point, Mystery door. Foreplay is important. - You're right, foreplay is important. - [Marshall] Foreplay is important, bro. - It's about the journey, not the destination. I'm sorry I was yelling earlier. - Making love is like making a grilled cheese. Give it time to breathe. - [Marshall] It's salty, it's gooey. It's usually accomplished in three to five minutes. - Hey, Hey guys, let's just get him back on track. Dylan. DYLAN... Did you, or did you not take... ... the druggies? - He presented me with two bags, okay? - Did you or did you not take a bag of something from a drug dealer yes or no? - Yes, but-. - See I told ya! - No... not my Dylan... (everyone talking over each other) - Look at that shite bucket! Hey! We got this guys (SINGING) He took the druggies! - So you failed that test. - Just gotta get that key code. - You CAN do this. Christmas CAN be saved. - We got this, right guys? Woo! - So what, now I gotta go scour my whole house for a key code combo just to open some bullshit door? - I'm a, I'm a bull crap door? I'm a bullshit door, that's what you call me? - I think what the golden door is trying to say- - No, I'm gonna curse now. If he's gonna curse at me, I'm just gonna say it right back. - Hey, Hey, I'm just as important- - Important, oh, you're important? - I'm just as important as this dude's quest for sobriety. - You are in control... - Breathe. Well done. - You suck! You fucked this whole thing up! - You're the door that led to drugs asshole. You started this wrong. No handle. - Breathe. - Don't need to spend my whole fucking Christmas- (everyone yelling loudly over each other) - Okay let's all talk at the same time. Who can be louder? Who can be louder? I'm loud. Look, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - Hey. Knock knock... - Fuck you. - No, fuck YOU! - Fuck you Golden Door! and fuck you Dylan! You know I was gonna help but you know what? I don't need to hear another story about a straight white dude feeling bullshit remorse for his own self-destructive ass! Boo, hoo! Just, watch all the empathy I have for you. Look at my face, see how empathetic I am? Now I'm gonna have grilled cheese, dirty sex with your dead fucking dad, you punk-ass bitch. - Hey! What the fuck did you just say to me? Hey, open up and say that to my face motherfucker! Oh now you're gonna ignore me? - [Marshall] For the record, I'm not ignoring you. I just don't want to get involved. This is between you and the door. - Right, you know what? That's not fair. That's not fair! Oh! - Mother fuck! - [Marshall] Okay, that wasn't me. That was the door, I swear. I'm a little scared of you. - [Dylan] Hey! Hey, your buddy just tried to break fucking my nose. Oh great, now you're gonna ignore me too. (crashing) - You're doing drugs in dad's house?! I hate you! We all hate you! - Another one. Got a bunch of alive dudes today. (mix of sounds rushing) - [Dylan] It's a bear! - Yogi! Yogi! Yogi! - (singing) When the night- (explosion) (loud party) - [Dylan] These ones are pretty. [Lilly] I saved his life once again. - Saved my life. (harsh digital sounds) - [Dylan] Had a whoopsy-doodles. - A major whoopsy-doodles. - Today my court-appointed therapist suggested that I talk to an empty chair. That I could put my dead dad or anyone from my past or present just write in an empty chair and I can hash things out that way. Look, the second that I start talking to inanimate objects - [Dylan] Oh, that's blood. I'll take that please. (nurse talking) (vibrating sound overwhelms) (choking) (inhaling raggedly) - What the hell was that about? Huh? (laughing behind door) (mysterious music) - [Marshall] Doctor told me I can't eat nuts anymore. Because I got diverticulitis in my rectum. - Yeah, nope you gotta' stay away. - It's just smooth peanut butter from here on out. - Yeah you gotta' stay away from the bad stuff. - All right, I'm going, I'm going. - If you don't stay away from the bad stuff diverticulitis in the rectum... Angel! (stuttering) - [Dr. Rose] Angel's had a really long happy life. Now, I know that because doggies don't make it this long without a lot of love. She's got a tumor and it's right at the neck of her bladder. Here's the thing though, I'm gonna level with you. (jumbled) -she does have cancer. Keep that in mind- The only way that she's gonna be able to urinate right now- - Hold on. So she has to have this plastic thing hanging out of her? Like a cone for the rest of her life? - Effectively, Yes. So the game plan is that we're gonna have to keep that catheter in place, because it is the only way she's gonna be able to pass urine right now. And it's being kept in place by this balloon that resides in her bladder. If she's able to chew at that catheter, that catheter can go up into her bladder, it can rupture, and in the end we're not gonna be doing surgery in this kind of situation. That's instant euthanasia, Dylan. - Listen to her, she hates the cone. I'm not gonna torture my dog for the last two weeks of her life, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna do it. Is there anything else I can do for her? I'll level with ya. Here's what it is. If she's with you on the couch, head in your lap, go ahead, pop the cone off. You know give her a good scratch behind the ears. Things like that. The same rule applies though. I mean you gotta be watching her really tight. So that cone's the only thing that's gonna be stopping her from getting at it. Now it's tough love, I know that. It's not the greatest- - it could end up rupturing her bladder. We discussed this before, we're not gonna be doing surgery. She's got a tumor. (whirlwind of sounds) You stupid piece of shit. - You need to stop. - You need to be watching her! - She has CANCER! (Angel whining) (voices yelling) - [Dylan] Angel... (voices yelling) (Angel whining) Just get your fucking shit together! (sighing deeply) - (funny voice) Ah gaw-ga-gaw-ga-goo! That's my babies. Hi. Hi Angel... Oh, let's take this off of you. Oh, get this off of here. You're having a good day? Oh, you're having a good day baby girl? Oh, how we doing here? Oh smiling. That was a good- Oh, you're doing okay. You're smiling. You're doing okay. (choking sound) (loud knocking) (scary music) (knocking) - Fucking stop. - Why can't you stop? (crash) - Good, there you are. I forgot to tell you. Be sure to hide any razor blades or guns you got in the house. - You know I don't own a gun. - Oh! - Here, take mine. You gotta have a toaster if you want to make toast. - I am not suicidal. Why would I kill myself? - Dylan, you've been slowly killing yourself for years. Do you know what drugs do to your body over time? - Yes asshole, that's why I've been sober -- - Choo choo! Look I gottta go. My sugar baby is lactating. - Get you fucking hand out of my face! How do you open the goddamn golden door? - Dylan. If you didn't select the great green glorious goodie bag of glee, the golden door would've opened up on its own. I guess you've got to wait another year. - I'm calling the cops. Ooh scary, you're calling the cops. Call the cops. Be sure to tell them that a golden door teleported here, Your ex-drug dealer materialized. He's felon and he's been waving a gun around. Translation bro: The cops can't do shit for you now. (electronic music leaks through door) Hahaha!!! (phone dialing) - What? - All right, um... There's a drug dealer in my house and he has a gun. He's waving it around, I'm fucking scared man. I need you to send someone right away. What do you mean you can't help me? [Marshall] Ah shit! Shit! Shit! (phone dialing) - [Mom Voicemail] Hi, you've reached Gloria. Sorry I'm not here now. - [Mom] I really am Dylan. I'm sorry I'm not here now to help you. You can do this. You're so strong. My baby boy, I miss you so much. - Stop fucking with me! - Stop! - (screaming) Stop! Ah. Please, I am truly, genuinely trying my best. (lock clicking) Can't you like search my heart? Can't you like see that I'm not, I'm not lying to you. Like I did not touch anything for a literal calendar year. Talk to me. Please? Please??? (laughter) (yelling) (echo) I'm gonna be adopted? - Like this isn't- (fragmented voices) - [Mom] Congratulations! - Oh, is this that uh... The, the magic stick. Can you do it? The magic stick thing. I want to see if I can figure it out sober. - Okay, hold on. Let me get the dirt off my hands. Okay, so you see how this has six colors? It's the same on both sides. - Yeah. - Go ahead and pick a number one through six. - Three. - Okay. 1, 2, 3, land on orange. Is that fair? You just go phew, there you go. Now it's orange. - He's a genius! - How does he do it? Do you know how he does it? I don't get it. - Dude, our dad taught that to us when we were five. It's a trick for kids. [Dad] Tenth fricking time I've fixed the fridge in a month. (whining) - Stop flossing, everywhere you go. It's disgusting, you fling food shit everywhere. - I'm not gonna apologize for having perfect teeth. - You, you can have amazing teeth later. - Perfect teeth, you annihilate your insides, but then you worship your teeth. You make no sense to me. (happy music) - Congratulations! (fireworks) - [Trophies] Surprise, surprise, surprise! - What! Guys? I haven't seen you in forever. - Tell us the story. We want to hear the story. Oh come on, of course I'll do it Yeah! Woo! Go Dylan! Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen seconds left of the game. We are down by one. Goalie pulled. Center ice face off. Ref drops the puck. Your's truly wins the face off. - Obviously. I find an open patch of ice. - Yeah, of course. - He gives me the puck, I dipsy-doodle around a defender. - Duh! Boom! Nothing between me and the goalie baby. I got a break away. Holy cow! A breakaway?! - There's only seconds left in the game? - The winning goal on his stick? - I don't understand sports. - So, this is kind of one of those moments - Where time freezes. - I see my Mom in the stands. - Woo-hoo! She's just so proud of me. And you know, I'm a kid. - I'm a trophy! - I got dreams. So I imagine what it's gonna be like to win the Stanley cup. Score that game-winning goal. You know, the cameras come rushing onto the ice families in your face. We got a happy ending, ladies and gentlemen. - Yes! I love happy endings! - Happy endings are my favorite! - What happens next? - You guys know what happens next. My head hits the plexiglass full blast. I get knocked out cold once I hit the damn thing, my neck is the first thing to hit the ice and neck snaps in four places. I mean, he's not getting up. Things could not possibly get worse for Dylan. Things couldn't possibly get worse for Dylan- - couldn't possibly get worse for Dylan could they? - That's my boy, Dylan! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, shh. - Do you guys hear that? - Oh, oh, I'm sorry! Is he about to bounce back? (whistling rally cry) Ladies and gentlemen! We have a Rocky Balboa kick-ass montage on our hands! (cheering and yipping) - He's gonna be bigger, faster and stronger! (triumphant music) (Trophy Battle Cry!) - [Trophy] Did you do it? ...Did you become a hero? - No. I'm sorry everybody. He missed an entire year of school. Bedridden. Puking from vertigo through a neck brace. Whatever friends that he still had, they all abandoned him because over the years he just steals. He just steals pain pills from all of their houses. I mean he didn't even have the strength to speak at his father's funeral. (chimes clanging) (clanging speeds up) - [Young Dylan] Hello, everyone. Thanks for coming. I never really met my biological dad. I called my adopted dad, "dad". Since the first day that they adopted me, and... (exhales) I can't do it. - If you knew my dad, you knew that he was a giant kid at heart. He was a prankster and to be honest, I'm kind of half expecting him to like pop out of his coffin and go, "gotcha". He loved Disney movies. - Hercules was his favorite because it's a story of a God forced down from Mount Olympus to birth as a baby only to be adopted by humans and raised as one of their own. Eventually he learns of his powers and the adopted kid saves the day. When he got sick, he would hide these little notes for us to find. So when he passed, we would look at them and look back and not be sad. He didn't want remembering to be always such a sad thing. He always said good morning to me when I woke up. (sobbing) He always said "Choose good." - It's so easy to be selfish and lie, and blah blah blah. Hercules not only has killer abs, but he has a killer heart. No scratch that he doesn't have a killer heart. He has a kind heart. The point is- - he spent his whole life helping us to be brave, (sobbing) pushing us to choose good and step out of our comfort zone. - I'm not ready to say goodbye to my dad, I'm not- - He loved us all equally. There was no separation between his biological and adopted kids. - I don't feel okay. My head is- - Whoa! - Oh no! We've got him! - We're not gonna lose you. - Let's go! - Dad, he has literal crap - - It's so bad, oh no. - Tag! - Oh no- - My sister... - Let go you're gonna break it! - You're gonna break it, come on please stop. - Dylan!!! - Why did you rip it off we worked so hard on it. - Hey what the hell? - He broke it, you're an asshole! - She needs to learn that he's not coming back and not everything is a sign from dad. - No grandpa told me that I could just have five more minutes with dad. - he said -- - Dylan! Ah! - Hey, get off of him! - Dylan if you touch my stuff again I swear I'll break your neck! He's not even your real dad! [Young Lilly] He can't breathe! He's MINE! [Young Lilly] Briana, calm down! - You don't get to say anything! [Young Lilly] He can't breathe! (Young Dylan choking) [Young Lilly] He can't breathe! - [Briana] Is he asleep right now? Are you fucking sleeping right now? [Briana] I hope you're ODing. [Young Lilly] He can't breathe! - [Briana] Do us all a favor you fucking embarrassment. - Wake up! - WAKE UP!!! - Wake up! - Wake the fuck up! (Dylan choking) - Hey, you want to know the secret to life? - Moderation? - Mm. Yeah, but no, it's this. So, see how it's the same on both sides? It's a bunch of different colors. Pick a number one through six. - Four. - Are you sure you wanna stick with four or you don't wanna change your mind? - Okay, three. - Oh three, okay. We're gonna go one, two, three and we land on green, is that fair? - Mm, hmm... All right, hold your hand out. Okay, so we're gonna go one, two, "whoosh". There you go. Green on both sides. Magic. - How did you do that? - You get a piece of wood, spray paint it black, get a bunch of shitty 30 cent gemstones that you glue to it. And no matter what you were gonna do, I was just gonna force the color green on you. So you said four initially, if you didn't change your mind, I'd just go one, two, three, four. Land on green, but you changed it to three. I gave you the illusion of control. So then I go one, two, three, and I landed on green. You could pick any number, five. I would just go F-I-V-E, green. One, two, six, O-N-E, T-W-O, S-I-X. No matter what you do, I'm gonna get you to land on green. So, there you go, there's the secret to life right there. It doesn't matter what you do. - That's bullshit. - Yeah, it is bullshit. We finally agree on something. - Oh no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, you can't. You can't. You can't okay. Okay, okay. You okay? Is this okay? Okay, you're okay. You're okay, you can't do that baby. Okay? Okay, okay. I'm sorry, okay. I'm sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll put this back on, okay? Okay. There you go. There you go. There you go. Okay. Okay. [Dylan, on the phone] Hey, uh Tristan. [Tristan, on the phone] Hey, what's going on? [Dylan] I need help. [Dylan] This is it. [Tristan] Okay... - [Dylan] So you know, you know Angel is really sick and she only has a few weeks left. And I, I need help, I need to go somewhere but I don't wanna leave her alone. - [Tristan] I can help you take care of Angel. We'll figure this out. I love dogs and I'll gladly love on your dog-- I need you to stay where you are. You're at your mom's house right? How long ago did you take-- (phone calls blend together) - I can't have you pass out- - Stay on the phone. - Do I need to call an ambulance? - Breathe out. - Yeah just like that. (harsh loud static) (loud crashing) - [Mom] Why can't you stop? (harsh loud static) I told him no drugs. I am not having a druggie here during Santa's presents. There are gonna be children here. I had one rule! - [Mom] - fucking kill him. - Okay, what's going on? - Right now, this is what we have to deal with. How high he is. So every time you come in saying that you're not high, we can see- Okay mom, relax. I just walked into the room, okay? Hey, I, I haven't done anything in months, okay. I've been sober for four months. - Sober three years. - I've been sober for 28 years, so there's that. - That's a bunch of bullshit. You smoked weed with Alex in high school in the backyard. - Oh, okay, because smoking weed is the same thing as doing opioids and Xanax. Sure. Haven't you smoked meth a few times? I am going to go and finish, setting up Christmas. If anyone wants to join me, please feel free. - Yep. - What? You fucking have. He said you gave him the Xanax. - Wow. If I had Xanax, I would be on Xanax right now. - That's what I said. - No shit. - Fuck him. Let him rot, he'll wake up when he wakes up. He's slept on cardboard, he can sleep on a fucking wicker chair. (slow chiming) (tense music building) (dissonant violins screeching) (Angel barking) - (voicemail) Hi, Mr. Bradley This is Sherry from Dr. Rose's animal clinic. This is a courtesy call letting you know that Angel's remains are available for pickup here at the office. And it goes without saying that the entire staff here is so sorry for your loss. All the very best. - [Friend's Voicemail] Love you bud, saw your post about Angel. Ah, just wanted to call and say, Hey, and just, you know, see how you're doing. Love you bud. Talk you later. [Lotus] Your puppy went floating to nestle in clouds. Together with God, we will work this all out. You wish it was you and truth be told, it should. That dog was perfection, you've done nothing good. You finally found your fix it or fuck it. So peel off that glue and let's get unstuck it. Don't worry so much because life's a parade. You still have a handful of cards yet to play. So go on you big dummy and don't be afraid. Blah, blah, motivational bullshit. Namaste. - I don't know how to quiet the voices in my head. It's really difficult for me. My brain is like, like a popcorn machine. Fireworks. A bunch of hyenas fighting for attention. [Lotus] If a situation upsets you, you leave it, you change it, or accept it. You are in control. (static) [Mom Voice] Why can't you stop? [Young Briana] Try again. [Briana] Try again. [Lotus] You are in control, breathe. - I'm crumbling. I'm falling apart. And I know I'm supposed to put my faith in God and everything with the program says, you got to put your faith in God, but my whole family's gone. [Mom voice, comforting] Okay. [Dylan] And I miss my mom. [Mom voice] Everything'a gonna be alright. - You know how sometimes like you're sick and you just really need your mom. You just really need your mom. And I miss my dog. (sobbing) Oh I miss my fucking dog so much. - [Briana] If you don't fucking call me back, I'm gonna call the cops to do a fucking wellness check on your ass okay? [Lotus] Leave it. Change it! OR ACCEPT IT! [Lotus] YOU are in control. - [Mom] You act like I, I haven't been here. You don't under- I remember him when he was a little boy. He was everything good. He was all goodness. I know it is still in him. I, I see it when he's high for Christ's sake. - If you baby him, you bury him. - It's not his fault, it's a disease. - Oh, can you stop calling it a disease? He doesn't have a fucking disease. Cystic fibrosis is a disease. Lungs fucking failing. 24-7 sick, cancer, Alzheimer's, all diseases. Mom. He's an addict. If he just stops doing drugs, he's cured. Stop calling it a disease. He just has no fucking self control. - I don't understand how you can say things like that. - Mom, if one of us was married to a fuck-up, you would be saying the same shit to us. - I guess it's different when it's your kid. - [Briana] Okay, well he's our brother and I refuse to feel bad for him anymore. As far as I'm concerned, he's just some other asshole that keeps breaking my mom's fucking heart. And until he stops, he can fuck right off. And here we are again, cleaning up his mess. Can you explain to me why we're taking care of this right shit now? He doesn't give a fuck about any of this stuff. Why should we? - Okay, just. - Hey mom? Mom, can you look at me for one second please? Hey, mom, please. Brianna and I were talking, and you need to stop doing this. You can't keep doing this anymore, alright? This is your intervention now. So you, you need to choose. Dylan is killing you with his sickness and he's not going to stop if you keep enabling him. So, do you want a relationship with Dylan or do you want a relationship with me and Brianna? Because you can't have all three anymore. Not until Dylan gets his shit together. - He hasn't gotten his shit together in two decades, you think he's gonna start now? - Briana can you maybe help for two fucking seconds please? - [Briana] Maybe I'm just sick of living in the fucking Twilight Zone and we keep having to do this shit over and over again! [Dylan] Um well, so you think you're in control, but you never are. - Wait, that's dad's trick. You shouldn't be telling people how to do that trick. It takes the fun out of it. Magic isn't very magical if you know how the trick is done. - All right, well you told me to tell you. - Since when do you listen to what I say? - The whole point is on that side of the table, you don't stand a chance. So go ahead, go fuck around on your phone, comb your hair, obey speed limits, go to church, it doesn't matter what you do. We're all ending up in the same spot. So like, what's the point? Why should we try so hard? - Okay. What if I didn't pick a number? What if I picked a color? - I, I don't know. I didn't ask you to pick a color. I asked you to pick a number. - I know that, but what I'm saying is, is what if you sat down to do the trick and showed me that rainbow stick and I jumped in before you could say anything. So I was like, oh, I love blue. I don't want green, green is the color of puke. I want blue. - Um then I just, I just wouldn't the trick. - Then I win. - It's not about winning. It's a metaphor for how life isn't fair. - If I pick blue, I win. I crack the code. So you're stupid because you keep saying I'm not in control, but I am. See, this is why there's no female magicians. We figure shit out too quickly. (soft music) [Young Lilly] He would hide little notes for us to find. - I uh, I think I'm supposed to bring this to you. - Oh my God, Turbo. You figured it out. Four pills that you wrote on a million months ago with a Sharpie, that is the answer we've been talking about. Well done. Hey guys! He figured it out! - Yay he did it! - Yeah boy. - I knew he could do it, with that big dick, Dylan. - Big dick Dylan! - Sounds like a good time for a victory grilled cheese, buddy. - I don't know, man. Maybe it's not a literal key, you need- - It's a literal code, it's a literal key code, hoss. All right, you are acting like a re- really dumb person. - Golden Door! That is not the Golden Door we all know and love. That is frustration talking Goldie. - You know what, you're right. That's not me guys. That's not who I am. I'm always learning. And please give me thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. But Dylan -- mm -- hang on... what's a, I need a stupid name for you. Try again, Big Dog. Think hard. Pick a number. and plug it in right above my door dick. - You want me to pick a number? - When you repeat what I say back to me? - Yeah why are you repeating things Dylan? It makes me feel a little frustrated. - What's going on? - Try again. - Open up. - Try again. - [Golden Door] Pick a number. - You're all dead to me anyways. - Oh, we're dead to you? - [Young Briana] We're not gonna lose you let's go! - Think hard. Plug it in there. - Was that mean of me? Making-- - [Lotus] You are in control. - [Mom] You can do this, you're so strong. - What do you mean you can't help me? - You have to re-spawn yourself. - [Golden Door] Are you realizing something? Is that what this is? - [Tristan] I wanna see if I can figure it out sober. (emotional music) - [Lotus] Breath in. - Stay focused here, let's keep your head in the game. We got this. Stay focused. - [Lotus] BREATHE! - [Mystery Door] Why have you not been LISTENING?! We got this. Stay focused. (music and voices swell) (voices panicking) (voices talking over each other) - Ahh! (thud) - All right. Hi mom. Briana. Lilly. Okay. I got into magic after I got my right index finger cut off. When I was little, you know, it was a boat accident, had a boat load of stitches, pun intended. Dad joke. So my physical therapy was grabbing a foam softball, foam golf ball, and then, you know, picking up a single card. Because I don't have any feeling from here forward. And so I got really good at shuffling cards because it me gave something for my anxiety brain to do. Dad gave me a lot. Why it's important to donate blood. My love of hockey. I mean, half of my childhood is us playing one-on-one tournaments in the front. I was a terrible son. A worse brother. The definition of selfish. I'm ashamed. Truly. I don't ever want to go back to that version of myself. I want to matter. I want to help. I want to be a kick-ass grandpa telling stories to my grandkids. And you know, when I die, I want my story to be one about perseverance. Maybe it'll help for being, such a bad person for so long. (thud) (tap) Well now what? ("Silent Night" very slow instrumental) (music stops) (burps) (exhales) - I did it. - [Voicemail] Hey, you've got Dylan Bradley. If this is a professional phone call, please leave a detailed message. If this is a personal call, please profess your love to me after the beep. (beep) - [Briana] Hey dude. Um... Sorry for calling so early. The kids have... ...been awake all morning Um... (kids playing in background) Okay, I'm gonna cut the shit. There's still a lot of anger here and it's tough, okay? But, I just wanted to let you know, I'm proud of you. Honestly, I didn't think you'd do it, so gotta give credit where credit's due, huh? I'm glad you're well. Merry Christmas. Oh, hey, Mom and Lilly want to, hold on, yeah can I finish? I'm gonna let you talk. (kids playing in background) No, its a voicemail. No, he didn't answer. It's a voicemail. Take the phone! (phone clicks) (beep) - Wait, wait, wait. I got, I gotta call my mom. I gotta call my mom. Mommy. (coughs) (chokes) (gagging) (gagging) (inhaling deeply) (celestial music) (music box playing) (birds chirping) [Young Briana] So this will go back here? [Young Lilly] Yes. We like put that here for like the extra?-- - Hi big brother. - [Dylan] This looks really cool Do you wanna tell me what you built? - It's not a time machine. - Is it a magic trick? - No, it's more like happiness, a superstition, and aluminum foil in a box. - [Dylan] How does it work? - Well you get five minutes to go back in time to whatever time you want with somebody who's dead. - We chose dad since he's the only dead person we know. - Grandpa told us that when somebody dies, you only get one memory to return to where it's crystal clear. The rest of them get fuzzy and hard to remember. Usually people's voices are the first to go, or their laugh. But the memory is still there, repeating. Like when dad's old CD player would skip. - You go outside where Heaven can see you and you grab something they gave you. So like Bear-Bear. And you think back before dad was sick. So instead of him hurting in the hospital bed, he can be fixing our fridge or holding our hands while we go to the movies or something. - Or tying our skates. (machine beeping) (music builds) (dishes clinking) (Dad humming) (dishes clinking) - Hi Angel. (Dad humming) (Dad clears throat) - Whoa! you're up. - Can I help? - Can you help? Heck yes, you can help. What do you wanna do, you wanna wash or dry? - Yeah, can I wash? - Yeah, absolutely step in, okay. (chuckling) - Oh my gosh. There we go, is that good? - It's beautiful. - All in there. - [Dad] Yeah, you got it. Dig in, you got cocoa all over that thing. - (laughing) Yeah. Thanks for a great Christmas. - Thank you son. - I love you, dad. - I love you too kid. Thanks for cleaning up. - Okay, rinse it out. And grab another one. You got this. You're getting pretty good at this. - What are you doing on New Years Eve? (laughing) (slow piano music) (tape click) - (singing) ♪ to you, happy birthday to you, Happy birthday Grandpa Dylan! Happy birthday to you ♪ (party horns) - Well, come on over here. Help me out here, okay? Okay, now you ready? You guys ready? Go ahead, you can say it. (Both granddaughters) Make a wish! I love it, thank you very much. Okay, let's do it together right now, let's go. (blowing) Good girl, good girl. Thank you. Thank you very much. Did your wish come true? (calm music) (dreamlike music)
