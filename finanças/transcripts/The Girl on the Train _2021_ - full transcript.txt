We are simple people. It's not your job to go against gangsters. It's the police's job to send them to prison, not yours. Shekhar, I'm a lawyer. I know what you mean, but I cannot just get scared and let go of the case. Mira, I really admire what you do. But look at this. They're serious blokes. - I'll file a police complaint. - And how is that going to help? We'll get police protection for a day or a week or perhaps a month. Then what? Today, it was a stone. Tomorrow, it will be a bullet. Shekhar, please. This… Please what, Mira? What if your pregnancy test is positive? What will we do then? Listen, Mira, please. We are about to start a family. Right? Your actions will not only compromise us, but our child as well. Yeah? My client Joy Augustine has been in hiding from the past three weeks because of constant threats. Even his family hasn't been spared. Recently, though, he came out of hiding courageously to help the police solve the murder of Mark Matthew, a pub employee. This pub is owned by the accused, Mr. Jimmy Bagga, whose gun was found in the killing. Forensics have confirmed that the bullet that killed Mark was a 9.07-millimeter caliber bullet from a .37 short Colt pistol owned, again, by Mr. Jimmy Bagga. Wrong, Your Honor. As I mentioned earlier, - I was not in town when this happened. - Mr. Bagga... I have nothing to do with this unfortunate incident, sir. Please. Mr. Bagga, please do not speak unless you're told to. Keeping in mind the jury's verdict, the witness statements, and all the relevant evidence presented, I conclude that the defendant, Mr. Bagga, is proven to be guilty and is sentenced to life imprisonment. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Thank you, darling. You're wonderful. - Thanks for all you did for my son. - Take care of yourself. - Always. Stay away from guns and drugs. - Stay away from trouble. Yeah? - I promise I will. - Okay, I'll see you. - Thank you. Hey, come here. Have you thought of a name yet? Come on, let's go. Wasn't that movie too intense? You should stick to watching light movies from now on. Have you thought about how they'll affect our child? I don't want a child. I want a superstar. I see. What's wrong with having a boy-next-door? I'm a Bachchan fan. Right. Which is why. You good? Keep this. I have waited for this moment all my life. Two months to go. Tell me something. Have you thought about work? How you'll go about it? How you'll manage it? No, I don't want to work. I just want to spend all my time with my baby. Make his room, play with him, just be with him. Shekhar had told me not to take that case, but I was adamant. That mistake changed my life completely. In your case, amnesia is due to a psychological trauma. In medical terms, it's known as anterograde amnesia. In this condition, a patient cannot convert a short-term memory into a long-term memory. Patients retain things only for a very short time. The ones I… wanted to retain… they're not in my life anymore. We suppress the things we cannot forget. And in that, vodka helps. I had a miscarriage because of that accident. I lost my child. I was so busy fighting the pain, I didn't realize when I became dependent on alcohol, and when it took Shekhar away from me. I travel on this route every day because it helps me look into my past. I used to stay there. My first house with Shekhar. Best time of my life. But the problem with best time is that it doesn't last for long. I should actually say that… When I needed Shekhar the most… he cheated on me. He betrayed me… and married Anjali. So this is your late-night hospital shift? Mira, please don't create a scene. Now Shekhar lives in the same house with Anjali. The place where I used to once live. I travel in the same train every day. I sit on this very seat every day and watch the world outside. I get to see my most favorite house from here. And I also get to see her… the most favorite character of my story. I don't remember the first time I saw her. But slowly, I started feeling close to her… because when I see her standing there, I imagine myself. Living a perfect life with the perfect partner. How can anyone stay so happy? How can anyone's life be so perfect? Will my life ever be as perfect as her life is? I don't know. Maybe never. The truth is… I don't even know her name. Hello? Yes? What's the name? Where? Okay, thanks. There's a missing person report from City Hospital. Staff nurse "Nusrat John" hasn't reported to duty in 24 hours. And her phone is switched off. Nusrat John? Any criminal records or any past records of disappearance? No, ma'am. No such thing. She's clean. She was here the afternoon of the 31st. I met her myself. Did she have a fight with anyone? Not at all. Everyone loves her. Anything you're missing that I should know which might help? Anything? There was this party she wanted me to come for that evening at 6:00, with her dance class friends. But, Officer, though we went there together, I couldn't spot her later. Whose party was it? Which one? That guy. Nusrat had attended his party. Since when do you know Nusrat? Since the time she joined classes. Are you trying to be smart? I can ask you these questions back at the police station. We were dating before she was married. Three months. That's it. Really? When did you see her last? I don't remember. Didn't she attend your party? Don't know for sure. There were more than 100 people. And everyone was wearing masks. I didn't see her even if she did attend it. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Can I go now? We take many pro bono cases, too. Our firm is small. But trust me, it serves the people just the way you think. - Impressive. - Thank you. But… you haven't taken a single case since last year. May I ask why? Any problem? She reminds me of my past. I, too, used to be like her once. She's everything I lost. I don't think I have ever seen anyone so happy. I don't know whether this is jealously, self-pity, or desire. I feel like flying when I see her dance. I feel like losing myself. Sometimes I think if this is all real or is it just a dream? Hi. Anjali… What happened to you? Your ex, she keeps calling. This is too much, Shekhar. How many times has she called you? She hasn't called me. Don't lie to me. - Okay, she has called me. Listen… - I knew it. Make her understand, for God's sake. She's losing it. Okay, I promise. I will talk to her, okay? Don't let this ruin your mood. It's your birthday today, right? Let's take a picture. Look how pretty you look. Hey! Facebook and ex-wives do not make good friends. Come on, Mira. It's over with him now. Can I have a couple of Jägers, please? Hey. Whatever little of Shekhar that's left in you, I want to murder him. Come on. Yes, girl. Yes! Two more please. Repeat. Monsoon cheated the clouds The rain claims I learned angry tears are not the same Monsoon cheated the clouds The rain claims I learned angry tears are not the same I don't know why doesn't God hear The pleas of the hurting soul I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool I feel cheated The deceitful bird has left The wind heartbroken The peepal tree is withering away The deceitful bird has left The wind heartbroken The peepal tree is withering away Only the one who hurts screams in pain I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool I feel cheated I feel burned Kunal, a few friends of Nusrat from the dance class said that she visited a psychiatrist regularly. We need to question him. Dr. Hamid, I'm Inspector Kaur. Nusrat was very lonely at heart. Extremely emotional. She is only missing, Dr. Hamid. Why did you use "was"? I didn't mean that. What did you mean then? When was your last session with Nusrat? 30th. A day before she disappeared. Yes. Any unusual behavior? Did she have any problems with anyone? No. Last week… when I went to meet her after her dance classes, she was talking to someone. Hi. Where's my money? Don't fuck around with me, girl. If by tomorrow, you don't show up with the next installment, I'll expose you to Anand. You'll get your money. Just stop chasing me. I did ask her about it, but she totally avoided that conversation. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Who was that? - Just an old friend. Come. I thought she is hiding something. I guess she… had her secrets. Dr. Hamid, has Nusrat ever told you about Rajiv? Her ex-boyfriend. Rajiv was never her boyfriend. In fact, she never liked him. - Bye, see you. - See you. - You're all right? - Yeah. You didn't call me back. I was waiting. I wasn't supposed to. You know I don't like to wait. - It's not my problem, Rajiv. - I'm not done yet. Next time I call you, make sure you pick up. That's not gonna happen. - Leave my hand. - Make me. Leave my hand, asshole. At least I'm better than your bloody husband! Okay then, all right, Dr. Hamid. Thank you for your cooperation. Officer. Find her. Please. I will. - Is everything in there? - Yes, ma'am. All the recordings between Dr. Hamid and Nusrat. All right, thank you. Imagine you could fly. Then where would you go right now? Deep into the forest. In absolute silence where you can feel the breath you take. If given a chance to reverse any decision you have made in the past… that you'd want to change… What would you want to change from your past? I don't want to change my past. I don't have any regrets. I want to change my present. Nusrat. Are you fucking deaf? Nusrat! What the fuck were you doing? Didn't you hear me calling out to you? Nusrat, I'm talking to you! What do you want to talk about? I had called the hospital. You weren't there. Care to tell me? You wanted to talk or did you run out of money to buy drugs? You're hurting me. Let me go. You're hurting me, Anand. Let me go! One day, I'm going to kill you. Anand is very possessive. He's dominating and tries controlling me. I told you I'll give you your money, mate. Stop troubling me every day. Thank you. The wife is missing and the husband is busy shopping. It's her hospital that files a missing person's report. Excuse me? And who are you? - Where is Nusrat? - I don't know. - Then who does? - How the hell am I supposed to know? Mr. Joshi, in such cases, husbands are often the prime suspects. It's your choice. Anything I should know? We had our differences. Like normal couples do. In case of a normal married couple, if the wife goes missing, her husband files a report. Doesn't seem to be the case here. A word of advice. Hiding the truth will only bring you more trouble. - We were contemplating divorce. - Why? I think she's having an affair. I felt a little strange that day when I saw her. Something wasn't right. Perhaps something was bothering her? I wish I could meet her, talk to her. Who is that? I have never seen him before. Who is he? What are they talking about? Is she having an affair? This is not her husband. No, no, no. What are you doing? Don't be stupid. You can't ruin your marriage like this. No, no, no. Why is she cheating on her husband? What can you do? She's doing… the same thing that Shekhar did to me. Divorce is a sign of a strong woman. It's proof that you don't take shit from anyone. The perfect image I had of her in mind. She's ruining it. She's breaking it. She's… She's making a big fucking mistake! What will you get out of all this? Are you even listening to me? You are losing it! Forget her. I can't forget her. I can't! She's wrong. She's the one who is losing it, not me! I'm not losing it! I have to stop her. - You sound betrayed. - I have been betrayed. It feels like I'm fucking losing everything again! What Shekhar did to me, when he cheated… - Can we just... - Today, once again… Stop talking about Shekhar. I feel like cursing him… I'll do just that. - Shekhar, you fucking son of a bitch! - Stop it. Calm down. You're better than this. - If I could... - You're too drunk. You should go home now. If I could… I would… I'd just go to her house… I'd grab her by her hair… and smash her face on the table! Smash it! Till she fucking dies! Mira, don't do anything stupid. You will regret it. Ma'am, have a look at this. Where did you get this from? I questioned the guests who had attended the party. One of the guests shared this video with us. I also checked that place's CCTV footage, ma'am. Look at this video. Rajiv is forcing Nusrat into the basement. After we searched the place, we found a broken mirror, a few drops of blood, and Nusrat's mask there. We gotta go. Rajiv, bro. - You need to go. The police are here. - What? - They're coming for you now. - Shit. You need to go, dude. - Stop there. You! Stop! - This way! - Stop! Don't move! - That side quick. Don't move! Get him! You, stop! This way. There he goes. - Where did he go? - There. You, stop! Just stay fucking there! The mirror in the basement of the party hall is broken. There are blood stains on the floor. Do you want to tell me what's going on? You were forcing yourself on Nusrat. We have the CCTV footage. What the hell is going on? You should talk to Komal. She'll tell you the truth. Who is Komal now? Don't be such a tease. Let me see. What're you doing? I thought you want to be a starlet. Johnny's going to make you a viral star. You know how many YouTube followers I've got? Ma'am, this is Komal. That's Tony, her boyfriend. And that's Johnny. Johnny had shot this video on the phone. Explain the blood stains on the floor and the broken mirror. I'm waiting. This bastard touched my girl. I should have killed him. - Hey! - Rajiv! No! Tony! Shut up! Fuck! Ma'am, Nusrat left the party early. She was in a hurry. It was my mistake. I should have stayed away from Rajiv. This was found in his bag. - Take them out of my sight, please. - Come on, you three. Come. Ma'am, if it's not him, then who committed this crime? Hey! Hey! This is forensic. Go on forensics. Over. We have identified the body of Nusrat. We are doing a test kit, but we need more manpower. According to forensics, Nusrat was killed and then dragged. There are injuries on her back. That means the killer wanted to kill her somewhere else, but he later changed his plans. There's one more thing, ma'am. Someone had come to meet Nusrat that evening. What do you mean? - Let me show you something. - Sure. Ma'am, this is the CCTV footage from Nusrat's house. From the entry gate. That's Mira Kapoor. But, Kunal, isn't it possible that she was there to meet Anand? But according to Anand, he's never seen her before. And, ma'am, if you look closely, she looks angry. She might be drunk. She has a history of alcohol abuse. What else do we know about Mira Kapoor? Well, like I said, alcoholic, divorced. She's a lawyer, but for the last year she's been inactive. And how is she connected to Nusrat? Well, 30 feet away from where we found Nusrat's body, we found this. Mira Kapoor, CitizenCard. And we found blood samples that don't match Nusrat. We have sent it for analysis. - This is not a coincidence. - No, it's not. Now, ma'am, Mira stays in Redbridge, but she got down at Greenwich station at 6:00. And she was outside Nusrat's house, intoxicated, at 6:30, right? Exactly. And then she reaches her home at 11:00 p.m. That means when Nusrat was murdered, Mira Kapoor was most probably in Greenwich. Yes, ma'am. And of course, looks like she was present at the forest where Nusrat's body was found. Guys, I need all the CCTV footage of all the shops and stations close to Greenwich forest. We need to find out where exactly Mira Kapoor was when the crime took place. Yes, ma'am. You fucking son of a bitch! Smash it till she fucking dies! If I could… I would… I'd just go to her house… and grab the back of her head. I would jerk her back, take her head… and smash her… till she fucking dies. Hey! My memory is a puzzle… with a bunch of missing pieces. What I remember… is something… I'd preferred not to. Congratulations to the new head of cardiology. Finally, we have good news in our lives. Cheers. What happened? How did you get hurt? I tried to stop you after your fourth drink. - You hit me with a corkscrew. - Shit. Shit, I'm so sorry. My ex-husband used to say, "If you apologize… but keep doing the same damn thing again and again and again… it doesn't count, Mira." The furniture of your house sucks. I'm really sorry for this. My bosses were in there. This is ruining my reputation, my career. You always think about yourself. I could never tell him… that it wasn't me. That was my wound. The wound… that never healed. Slowly… that wound spread all through my body. Mira, please sign these papers. What is it? Divorce papers. I'm done with our toxic relationship. This isn't the Mira I got married to. Have you gone mad? Mira, try to understand what I'm saying. Please! Please just sign the papers. Both of us are unhappy. Please try to understand. Shekhar, are you even listening? Mira, I beg you, let's end this. The papers are right there, just... Shekhar! I'm here today… because there's a part of my past that's gone missing. And I… want to remember it. I fear that… I might never be able to remember it. But I need to change my future. And for that… I want to remember. I have to remember. I have to remember. I have to remember what happened that night. I have hurt Shekhar in the past when I was drunk. I think perhaps, this time, I have done the same with Nusrat. - Hey! How was class? - Fine. - We drank a bit too much the other day. - Yes. - What the… - Yeah. - How did you get hurt? - Listen… - I need to talk to you. - Ms. Mira Kapoor? We're here for a murder investigation. Can I ask you some questions? Do you know her? We found her body near the lake in Greenwich forest. No. Are you sure? Yeah. So let me clarify this once again with you. You never knew and never met Nusrat? And that day you were at work, right? Yeah. You got down at Greenwich station at 6:00 p.m. because you wanted to meet your ex-husband, but you canceled your plan because you were not feeling well. Then you took a train from Greenwich station and reached home around 11:00 p.m.? Correct? Yeah. What are you? A compulsive liar? How much more are you gonna lie? Let's start with this. Is this you outside Nusrat's house at 6:30 p.m.? What were you doing there? I have no recollection of this. Must be a mistake. Maybe I went to the wrong address. Give me the CitizenCard. How do you explain this? We found your CitizenCard 30 feet away from the body. - It was stolen a few days ago. - Did you file a report for that? - I didn't find the time. - Another lie. From 6:00 to 11:00… you didn't meet your ex-husband. - How did you spend these five hours? - Officer, just take it easy. Excuse me? Your friend has been lying for 30 minutes. Not just to me but to you as well. She hasn't had a job since one year. Have you ever asked her where she goes every day? Our team is searching the crime scene. I don't have anything to arrest you right now. Pray that we don't find anything. And… do yourself a favor. Remember. Try to recall. What were you thinking, Mira? Do you think you might have hurt her? I don't remember. Your drinking is worsening the amnesia, Mira. But I can't sleep without it. I can't sleep. Passing out is not sleeping, Mira. Do you realize what can happen? You will have to remember what happened at the forest. And if you can't remember, there's going to be a lot of problems. Fucking die… Hey! Anand. Was it him? It's him. Dr. Hamid, Nusrat's psychiatrist. I had my doubts about him. It's definitely him. You are a lawyer. I need to ask you something. I'd hired a private investigator… to follow Nusrat. If the cops come to know, will I face a problem? Look, amnesia is memory loss. New memories cannot be created because of brain damage. Rest of the functions are normal. So what about Mira? Is she… violent? I don't know. Fine. Then write down that Mira never told you anything about Nusrat and sign the document. And God forbid, if I find out that you know something, then you will not only be an accomplice but also be charged for perjury. Mira had come to me a few days after the incident. She said she followed Nusrat into the forest… and then she blacked out. She doesn't remember more than that. I don't need more, doctor. Thank you so... Please understand, I know Mira very well. She will never hurt anyone. Sure. I have something for you. You had asked me to look out for CCTV footages at the nearby stations, shops, etc. We have received this CCTV file from the High Road station. On 31st night at 10:30 p.m., Mira is seen at the platform, waiting for the last train. High Road station? That's a small station. What is she doing there? Maybe because it's the nearest one to Greenwich forest? Have a look at her forehead. That's blood. It looks like fresh blood. No, but why would Mira want to kill Nusrat in the first place? I mean, it doesn't make sense. I would jerk her back, take her head and smash her! Smash her. Smash her till she fucking dies! - Hello. - Mira Kapoor? I saw you on the 31st. Who is this? I am Walter. I know what happened that night in the forest. But everything has a price. I'll pay. Just tell me the time and the price. Good but don't involve the cops. I'll send you the drop-off details when the time is right. Nusrat's murder took place between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. We have CCTV footage of you at High Road station at 10:30 p.m. You don't have any alibi for that time. You are wasting my time. Your visit to Nusrat's house, station CCTV timings, Citizen pass… Your injuries, blood… You are a lawyer. A damn good one. You know what this means to the prosecution. I don't have a motive to commit this murder. All these points and evidences that you have are circumstantial. They won't stand. And my amnesia? Have you forgotten about that? This isn't enough. You cannot do anything. Fine. Let's leave it to court then. But for your information… we have a statement from your doctor. According to him, you fear… that you have hurt Nusrat. You are a smart lawyer. You can imagine the jury's reaction over this statement. That morning, I had seen Hamid and Nusrat together. - They were together, so... - Mira, please. Your affair stories can distract Anand, not me. Ma'am. You need to take this. Excuse me. Hello? Nusrat's autopsy report is ready. She was… pregnant when she was murdered. We also found your blood samples at the crime scene. Ms. Mira Kapoor, you'll need to come with me to the police station. Can I take my medicines? Check on her. No! Excuse me. I literally try to make that swish sound. I see you, bob. It is what it is. Hold on. Hold on a second. - Hi. - What happened to you? I need your help. Anything. Just… say the word. I need a phone, I need cash. And… Gun. I need a gun. Hey, Doc. Who are you? What do you want? Who I am doesn't matter. - Look, if you want money, it's in the bag. - I want the truth. Nusrat was pregnant. Did you know that? Did you know that Nusrat was pregnant? - I don't know. - Don't lie. I had seen you two together. - Were you having an affair with her? - You're mistaken. - I am anyway going to prison. - Okay. Nusrat had asked me to come over. I want to meet you right away. Can you come over, please? I want to keep this child. I am scared. Why? Anand is not the father. What? So who? Who is the father? I tried to find out, but she didn't tell me. She kept trying to contact him. She was confident that by the evening she will sort this out. But that very night… she was murdered. This means… she was going to meet him in the evening. So… he could also be the killer. What are you? A compulsive liar? I have amnesia. I don't remember things. Why should I believe you? Do you realize I have enough evidence to send you to prison? 6:00 to 11:00… you didn't meet your ex-husband. How did you spend these five hours? Hey. Hi. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. Have you seen this girl? Are you sure? Have you… seen me here before? What? No. Okay. Thank you. Ma'am, the hunt for Mira is on. We still haven't found her. Go and talk to her friend Priya. - Ma'am, the data has been transferred. - Good. Can I have the phone back? Yes, ma'am. There is something you should see. What? A call came through to Mira the same day she escaped. So? Later that day, a text message came through from the same number, asking Mira to get money. Was it an extortion call? What? Can you trace this number for me, please? And give me the phone back. Yeah? - Yes, ma'am. - Yeah. Hi, this isn't working. Please. Sorry, ma'am, I'm afraid your card is out of balance. Your last journey was between High Road and Redbridge at 8:30 p.m. - Sorry. Can you top it up, please? - Yeah, sure. Here. Thank you. What time did you say I took the last train? 8:30 p.m., on 31st. From High Road? To Redbridge. Hello? Ma'am, Mira Kapoor was spotted at Paddington Station an hour ago. What? Yes, ma'am. We're talking to the people who saw her there. Yeah, I am on my way. Yeah. I'm sure it was her. She's got this height. She had, like, a wound on her head. Yeah. It was quite deep. She ran this way. Dear friends, welcome to this house of prayer. We've gathered together today to remember our dear friend Nusrat. This is, for all of us, a moment of great sadness. And yet, there are so many wonderful memories that we want to recall now and that we want to treasure. And so, in a moment of silence, let us bow our heads, remember her, and pray. - Amen. - Amen. You. - Where's your phone? - Why? Where's your phone? Show me your phone. - That is not your phone. - It is my phone. You've stolen this phone. That is not your phone. - What are you talking about? This is... - Hand it over. - No. - Hand it over. Should I call the cops? Give me the phone and the SIM card. Now. - It's good to see you. - It's beautiful. Shame you couldn't come to our party. - Yeah. - It would have been great. I hope you can make it next time. - Cheers then. Bye, take care. - Take care, bye. It was nice seeing her. I know. She couldn't even come to the party yesterday. - That would have been great. - Zehra. Mira, where have you been? I haven't seen you in a million years. I tried contacting you so many times. We were worried about you. After the party fiasco, I wanted to call you but… Shekhar suggested that I stay away. For what? - Shekhar told me that… - What? …I said terrible things about your furniture. - What? - I screamed and yelled at you. - I insulted you. I am... - No. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry for that. Mira, are you all right? Because no such thing happened. No such thing happened. No, Shekhar said that I broke some bottles and glasses, and I embarrassed you guys. And because of my behavior, you fired Shekhar from his job. Really? That's rubbish. You were feeling pukish, so we let you rest in our study room. You okay? Lie down. Okay? She'll be fine. Hi. Have fun. That's it. And then you guys left. Sorry, Shekhar. Shekhar, sorry. Sorry? You're sorry? You're sorry? First drama, then sorry. Create a scene and then apologize. Look at me. Look at me! Look at yourself. You cannot even stand properly. You are so disgusting. We would've remembered if something like that had happened. No. Then why did you fire him? Tell me. Because he was harassing a female employee, and we didn't want to file a complaint because Shekhar is an old friend. Trust me. You did nothing wrong. Good that you left him. You cannot trust him when it comes to women. Are you okay, Mira? Who told you that pregnancy would be risky after the accident? I told Shekhar very clearly, everything is absolutely normal. There would be no complications during pregnancy. But he said you don't want kids anymore. Take care. We could try again. - This time I'll... - Mira. I just met your gynecologist. She said there are many complications. You're medically still not fit for it. Why in these walls Have cracks started showing up There has to be a reason The distance suggests The sea has drowned every shore Pain lies awake in my sleepy eyes I feel shattered Trying to keep everything together I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love… Congratulations to the new head of cardiology. Drink some more. - No. - Come on, drink some more. I'm going to sleep. Sit down and drink. What happened? How did you get hurt? I tried to stop you after your fourth drink. - You hit me with a corkscrew. - Shit. Shit, I'm so sorry. Did you hear me? I want these papers signed by tomorrow. Shekhar. - Shekhar, I'm really sorry. - Mira! Shekhar, I'm sorry. I'll make everything okay. - Sign the papers. - I'll make everything okay. - Mira, just sign the divorce papers. - I can't sign them, please. - I said sign the papers! - Give me a chance. Just sign the papers! Your love was a lie Your claims were a lie Losing our hearts to each other Was also a lie Your love was a lie Your claims were a lie Losing our hearts to each other Was also a lie My love I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love My love You were so selfish, my love I feel so trapped in this marriage with Anand. He's become aggressive… again. I really don't know how you deal with this. I swear to God. I felt so dead inside before you came into my life. You've given me a purpose to live again. Your kisses and hugs, they've set me free. I feel the same way. You are like this breath of fresh air for me. I can't wait to meet you in the forest today. Gonna pin you down to the backseat of my car and really make love to you. And I am dying for it. I am dying to kiss those beautiful lips of yours. Walter is blackmailing me. If we don't give him the money, he'll take the photos to Anand. This is the footage from last Thursday night. That's me, right there. Yeah, but that's 8:30 p.m., not 10:30 p.m. Did you give this footage to anyone else? No, but maybe the night-shift guy did. Talk to him. Just find out if anybody else had access to this room in the last few days. That's gonna take more time. And more time means… More money, I know. Just take all the money you want. Just take it all. Just call him, please. Please, can you find out? Oh, my God! My house… What? How many times have I told you not to call on this number? Anand, Walter is dead. What? Who is this? - Mira. - Mira? Why do you have Walter's phone? I don't have much time. I need Walter's address. - Why? Who killed Walter? - Don't waste my time. Cops are after me. I don't know about Walter, but I think I know who killed Nusrat. Please, I need Walter's address. Or else, I'll have to tell the cops that you had a PI following Nusrat. Send it. Okay, I will. What are you doing here? I told you not to meddle! You are like that unwanted dog that keeps following you no matter how many times you kick it away. What do I do with you? No matter what I do, you are anyway going to forget it by tomorrow. You want me? You want me. Mira. What do you want? Why can't you just leave us alone? Shekhar, what the hell is this? Put some sense into that crazy woman. You said she won't be calling anymore. Why is she still calling you? I'll just check it. Hello? So you've saved Nusrat's number under my name. It's over, Shekhar. There's no escaping this. What nonsense. How did you get Nusrat's phone? Your DNA will confirm that you fathered Nusrat's child. You have 30 minutes. Come and meet me. Take a good look at them. - Nusrat's phone... - Don't move. Where's Nusrat's phone? Step back, Shekhar. Okay. Talk. I remember. I remember everything. All those terrible things that you said I had done… were actually done by you. I saw you in the forest that night. You killed Nusrat. What are you saying, Mira? Why would I kill Nusrat? - I have proof. - Yeah? Tell me everything. Or else when the police go looking for you tomorrow… they won't even find a body this time. You killed Nusrat. Tell me. We need to talk. Not now. Later. Later, when? You'll meet in the evening? Please. Nusrat and I, we were having an affair. Okay. We were going to meet in the forest like always. But that day, you followed her. Hey! Why were you following her? I had to bloody deal with you. When I came back… Nusrat surprised me. I'm pregnant. She told me she's pregnant, and I asked her to abort. I'll divorce Anand, like we had decided, to start a family. I don't want a child. Especially not with you. But she wouldn't listen. I was leaving. I was leaving her, I was going away, but she kept talking. She kept talking. She wouldn't stop. I'll tell everyone that this is your baby. I'll tell everyone that you sexually exploited me. You will rot in jail! She kept on talking. I didn't want to listen. I didn't want to listen to her, but she kept talking. And then she said… You used me. You used Mira. You used Anjali. Problem is with you, you sicko! That's the moment, I grabbed her. I was choking her to death. And I could see her breath just disappearing away. She looked so beautiful. I… I just wanted to kiss her. I couldn't stop myself. I kept going closer to her, but… She collapsed. You don't need to be scared of me, Mira. I won't kill you. I've always loved you. I've got something for you. Let's have a drink. Yeah? Just you and I... Stay back, Shekhar. Okay. Just one drink. See. I am sitting here. I am going to sit here. Think over it. Yeah? One drink. Come on. When did you change, Shekhar? You're not the Shekhar… I fell in love with. Or perhaps… you've always been like this. But I was too blindly in love to see this. So you want your life back. You want Nusrat's phone back. Take it. Mira… Mira, I love you. I love you, Mira. Then who killed Walter? The black car. So you finally know the truth. But what's the point? Too late. You were trying… to frame me. Why? Why do you think I did this? Jimmy Bagga was your father. Because of you, my father… committed suicide in prison. You are the one who sent him to prison. Your father was a criminal convicted by the court. I just did my job. The truth isn't always what it seems to be, Mira. I knew my father. He could have never done such a thing. And no law, court, or judgment can change my belief. You… were wrong. That is what you think. Because of you… I lost my child. You deserved more pain. That's why I started shadowing you after I saw you at the station. That day, I followed you into the forest. Shekhar and Nusrat were also there. They were fighting. Then Shekhar took it too far, and Nusrat collapsed. Shekhar got scared and left. You were lying unconscious. Shekhar hadn't killed Nusrat. She was just unconscious. When I saw you lying there, I wanted to strangle you to death, but I was unlucky. Nusrat decided to show up right then. Nusrat saw me strangling you. And before she could expose me, I had to get rid of her. You left as soon as you regained consciousness. So you changed the timing of the High Road station's CCTV footage. And the person I saw from the train, chasing Nusrat… it was you. She was the best opportunity… to set you up. Set me up? I figured out that Walter's killer had my phone, because the killer knew about our meeting. So I… sent another message to my phone from Walter's phone. And see… you read the message. Dalbir Kaur Bagga… I am the one who brought you here. Our love was flawed All I got was a bad name Our love was flawed All I got was a bad name My wandering heart faced Failure at every step All my dreams shattered Right before my eyes I feel shattered Trying to keep everything together I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love My love You were so selfish, my love I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love Your love was a lie Your claims were a lie… Today, I begin a new journey, a new train, heading towards a new destination with renewed hope. It's a new life with a new beginning, because I'm not the girl I used to be. I am Mira Kapoor, and this is my story. You were so selfish, my love My love You were so selfish, my love I feel defeated You were so selfish, my love Monsoon cheated the clouds The rain claims I learned angry tears are not the same Monsoon cheated the clouds The rain claims I learned angry tears are not the same I don't know why doesn't God hear The pleas of the hurting soul I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool I feel cheated I feel burned I waited for the moon during the day I kept an earthen pot in the rain I waited for the moon during the day I kept an earthen pot in the rain Love makes even a smart one go crazy I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool The deceitful bird Has left the wind heartbroken The peepal tree is withering away The deceitful bird Has left the wind heartbroken The peepal tree is withering away Only the one who hurts screams in pain I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel burned, I feel like a sad fool I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel cheated, I feel mad I feel cheated I feel burned
