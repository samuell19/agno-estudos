Eliott, I had a dream. of the future, than the earth the end of her resources had reached an unknown appeared planet in the sky: the red moon. For years, people plundered his new energy, the so-called "Lumina". But one day things changed the red moon its course straight towards the earth. Protected by an impenetrable magnetic field. Only one astronaut was in the able to stop the red moon. But as his mission drew near, he disappeared. Paul! Paul! You have to keep walking, Paul. seek the truth Have no fear. You mustn't be afraid. The Border is closed until further notice. All traffic into the North has been discontinued. Keep your distance from the wall. Don't leave this area. The Border is closed until further notice. All traffic to the North has been stopped. Ouch. - Be careful! - Wait! Wait! Is there one around here somewhere Taxi rank or something? It was really good. Follow me I have something that you might like. is it for sale I'm selling everything you see here. The lucky ones who have it over the Build a wall, leave everything behind. If you ask me, couldn't get any better time for good business. [TV Moderator] Is the end of the world near? [affirmative sound from Paul] I've been stuck here since fifteen years fixed. And over the years I didn't see any the crazy enough is to drive out there. Is it because of a woman? Yes. I knew it! A little polish and he is like new. You won't find anything better here. And the battery is fully loaded. You can drive with it for months. I mean if we survive. How much? 8,000. 8,000? And where exactly are you going? you have big balls to pull this off. Nobody knows what's out there. and you'd rather not know either. It's your decision. Do you need anything else? Seven days and 168 left hours until the end of the world. Unfortunately we still have heard nothing from Paul WR. It seems like has he vanished into thin air. So if you hear anything get in touch with me directly. Paul, find the forest. [TV presenter] And now there's suitable for you a playlist with 100 songs about the end of the world. Let's start with one timeless classic! [Auto] Power failure, Battery defective. Vehicle is shutting down. power failure, Battery defective. Vehicle is shutting down. power failure, Battery defective. Vehicle is shutting down. power failure, Battery defective. Perfect. OK. Imagine a world in of a few grams of lunar material a whole family a year could supply energy for a long time. Imagine the revolutionary discoveries in the fields of technology and medicine. Imagine, You could have a lifetime travel with a single battery. The future is within reach. "Lumina", the energy source, that will revolutionize your life. [Female voice] What exactly should I start with this? I'm sorry, what? your battery. She is defective and needs to be replaced. Shit. do you have batteries here? Do you sell any? Hmm. Now is that a yes or a no? Depends on. Can you count? How much? - 900. - Okay. With the loyalty points you get you an additional gift. - Good. - She'll be here in three days. OK. Uh, wait, three days? Well, if you want, I'll give you the present today. But the battery comes in three days. I don't have that much time. With luck they'll come a day earlier. you haven't had much luck lately, right? No. I mean... um, does that sound familiar to you? Really now? No. It's okay if you get the battery quicker I raise the price [TV] There were a lot of rumours, though now it has been officially confirmed. Space WR has the green light from the United Nations. The explosives were already on the outdoor module ... could you play the music make something quieter? ... attached to the space shuttle Aurora. But let's do it nothing to do, dear viewers, the shuttle must first Penetrate the magnetic field of the red moon. 'Cause as we all know so far none of the probes managed to penetrate. Only single pilot Missiles would probably be able to do that. - In case you're only tuning in now... - They're really pulling it off. this moment is truly historic. The shuttle Aurora is in front started exactly 30 minutes and the pilot is none other than the eldest son of Space WR founder, Eliott Eliott. [Eliott] Initiate approach phase. I wish you could see what i see The red moon is beautiful from here What about the signal? [Control Center] Aurora, is everything under control? I have everything under control. I've just entered the magnetic field... There is a problem. The entry speed is faster than expected. [Control Center] you're almost there. Impossible. The mission must be aborted. [Control Center] Negative! the Mission cannot be aborted. I can't make it I'm losing control! - You have to get me out of here! [Control Center] - Aurora. I'm burning. Get me out of here! I'm burning! Get me out! Wait! Your gift. Dad. [Junger Paul lauter] Papa. The Lumina. You have said it can fix anything. So mom can make it healthy. Paul, come on. You must be strong now. Eliott? [radio] It seems like the south of France electromagnetic storms, of an unprecedented extent. It is believed that the storms emanate from the red moon. Paul, stop taking your medicine. Don't listen to dad. you don't need them [TV] For many it feels like escape from a black hole. An electromagnetic field has in recent months formed around the red moon. A cloud that controls all communication and also prevents the extraction of the valuable Lumina. And still there is no sign of Paul WR As you know, he is the only one in the world to reach 100% in the Alpha R simulator. He proved it is possible in the magnetic field to pierce the red moon. What no AI in the world could do has, this man has mastered. where are you going You're not supposed to go out. It is dangerous. The ones out there have lost their mind I don't want anything to happen to you. All is lost. We're gonna die anyway. Look over there! There is no lumina here. Didn't you want me one? get a full battery? With any luck it will come tomorrow. It is said on TV you could save us When you see you alive thinks there is a chance. You're that Paul, aren't you? if i answer you will you leave me alone Okay. I am not. And now get out of here. swear it if you leave here can I come with you then? you should go away [TV] Paul still shines as if swallowed by the earth. Nobody knows where he is hiding or why he went into hiding. If you have any have information or advice report immediately to the authorities. He wakes up. That must be him. That's not posssible, He had no pulse for several hours up there In addition, his DNA shows mutations, presumably caused by that magnetic field. It seems like something has brought him back to life. How are you? sorry dad I thought I could make it? You did everything you could. But I failed. It's not your fault. It's mine. I thought I was dying And do you know what I thought about? The last summer with Mom when we were at the beach. Every day I went to the rocks at the lighthouse. I just sat there for hours. And stared at the sea. I thought, if I jump now, mom be better again. If I'm brave enough I could save her. The next day I went back but suddenly Paul was standing there I still remember, how he smiled at me. I asked him why he was there. I want to help you save mom. I will find him dad. And then I'll prove to you... You don't have to prove anything to me. I will find you. Dad what have you done? I'll never have to see her like this again. Yes I come. How can I help? We received a call yesterday. About that missing man. Never seen. Are you from the police? No UThen who exactly are you? Nobody special. I'm just on the lookiout for someone Why is he looking at me like that? I do not want to be alone anymore. What do you want? You can't forget it. That's why you're so angry. How does he know? Your wife left an infinite void I see him for the first time. He can't know all this. Your child suffered because of you. What have I done? Do you know what I'm thinking? I'm a monster. You should put her suffering to an end. I don't want to be alone anymore I can not anymore. You know nobody will come to help you. I'm afraid. There is no more hope. That's the only way I can be with her. I will be with her I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. I don't want to suffer anymore. I don't want to suffer anymore. Sorry, did you order a Lumina battery? Why are we stopping? You shouldn't be with me It is dangerous. You already know that here no more buses, right? No, I'll stay with you I'm serious, you have to go. You are this Paul that is wanted. If you leave me I will tell everyone. What car you drive, where you go. I'll say you kidnapped me and forced me, to do certain things with you. I can help you, to find the forest. You don't want to understand, do you? What's your plan? Get out! I won't say it again. This is my mom. She was constantly beaten by my dad. So she's down south. Hm. I just want to go in that direction. You're welcome! You can say I'm your child or something like that They're looking for a loner. Not a family man. Okay? You stay behind during the entire journey, Tomorrow you're on your own Otherwise you can forget it. Dad? You can find the truth in the forest Father! What's going on here? Do you even know what time it is? He's having another seizure. All right, Eliott, go back to sleep. He says he saw Mama. Is what Eliott says true? Are you starting again? Paul, I'm talking to you. I thought we sorted that out. She wants to show me something. Do you know why imagination is sometimes dangerous? She creates things that don't actually exist. You were in my dream too. You weren't you But I recognized you everything hurt you like you're dead That was just a dream. Do you think mom is thinking of us? Yes of course. Do not worry. Why won't you do it? You have to tell me what. What, save the world. Now stop it. With what? Your rumour. Why? [TV presenter sings] We're at the end. The Red Moon. Does it mean the end? - I wanted to hear that. - This stuff distracts me while driving. And why? Apart from that that it sounds like shit I don't like the guy. He talks too much to me. That's not difficult to understand, right? I could drive too. No, I really can. Bang! Put that away. Which star sign are you? One hundred percent fish. "It's the perfect day to meet new people. Your positive energy has an impact everyone around you contagious.” Nothing can go wrong today. What happened? I don't know, I have no control. [Car] Attention! You will soon reach a checkpoint. Please cooperate. Caution! You will soon reach a checkpoint. Please cooperate. Damnit. Hello, I'm in the umbrella business on the road looking for new customers. - What should ... - Ssshhh... Could I maybe inspire you for with a few models? I have just the thing for you. How about for example with this? [Car] Passage Granted! Can I help? Do you have a phone? Yes. Back there. you have to be patient if you are hungry. My husband is on the way and should be there soon. He's fetching supplies. Is the little one eating there too? I thought you didn't have anything. Got some canned food. Just gotta warm her up a bit. No thank you, but I can help with that. forget it sweetie I have that saved for the big day. What do you mean? Well, if we're saved. [phone] You will be put through shortly. Father? Paul, is that you? why did you let it You knew, that Eliott had no chance. Is he... Is he dead? Your brother is fine. Dad is lying. You must leave the red moon alone Don't destroy it, dad. Paul, it's okay to be scared. But you have to trust me. When your mother got sick the doctors only gave her a few months. It was hopeless. Father... I knew they were wrong. I would have found a cure. I could have saved her. But your mother begged me not to, she said... All she needs is to have us but her side And that everything will be fine again. As long as we have our faith. Her condition worsened. When it was too late, I realized my mistake. Do you see what I'm getting at Paul? Paul? [Dull, unintelligible language] Come on, get out of here! Everything okay? I was just thinking maybe we could call you Bruno. Bruno sounds good. Or Louis. Definitely something with an "M". Maybe Maurice. No, Maurice doesn't match your shirt. Maurizio? So I look like a Maurizio. Somehow I think he's beautiful, don't you? Is that even a name? So I like him From now on I'll just call you Maurizio. That's the first part of my plan. You're screwed without this plan, believe me But in exchange for my help, you have to tell me what's going on. When I was a child, I had visions. At least that's what I call her. There were some pictures that I didn't understand My father's project was going great, they had started To mine the lumina on the red moon I knew it was wrong. But I couldn't explain why So I gethered all the information I could get. and I suddenly reaslised, that it wasn't the first time The the paths of our earth and those of the red moon crossed. He kept showing up and with him there have always been great changes. Changes affecting life on Earth, as we know it, made it possible in the first place. And then what? Well I... I showed my father everything. What exactly am I supposed to do with it? The red moon wants you to leave it alone I have a medecine for you that you have to take every day. It's for your own good. You can trust me, Paul. Hey, look what I got. Well, I can tell you're not listening to me anymore. Let's go? - What is that? - This one? Part 2 of my plan. Are you coming? Clear. If the red moon wants to protect life on Earth, it all makes no sense. I think she wants to warn us with that. After all, it was we who exploited her. It was assumed that her trajectory would be predictable But she is not. That is, if we try to destroy it, will it wipe us all out? That's the problem. Then I hope you're right. And you are sure. - Because if not, then... - I know. Ready? - Yes. - OK. Let's see. - No. - Give it to me. - No. - Come on, go. oh shit You don't mind, do you? I can't say no anymore. Many Thanks. And the guy who made the mess, was that really that Paul? If I say that, then it's true. But he didn't look quite like he did on TV, you know. His face was all dirty. And he looked pretty run down if you ask me. By the way, he wasn't alone. There was a young girl. I would say around 12 or 13 You seem to like it. I have something else. Ah... But only when my husband is back. Her husband? Yes. Deep down you know it. [Thought voice] Does he mean what I think? What shall I know? say it [Thought Voice] You mustn't think about it. [Thought voice] It was not your fault. My... my husband? [Thought Voice] why did he do that? [Thought Voice] You can not help it. He won't come back. [Thought Voice] I will die alone [Thought Voice] All alone. It is better to use the fork for this. Many Thanks. All safe. May I? It's the only thing I remember The treatment erased everything else If I find this forest, it is proof that I'm not completely insane. And who knows. Maybe then I'll find out what he wants from me. We should go to sleep. Good night Maurizio. Tell me, what's your name? Elma. Good night, Elma. Slide over! - What's happening? - We have to move on. Wait! What? I have to tell you something. - We don't have time for this. - I betrayed you. Because of the reward. You do know that's not real, right? I could have guessed. And your mother? Didn't you want to go to her? My mother? I don't even know where she is. Holy shit. What's happening? We have visitors. Paul. Paul! Fasten your seat belt! [TV] Using the latest technology, we are able to you a three-dimensional picture to present out flora and fauna Before the great extinction, France had a biodiversity of 40,000 species. Did it really look like that here? Yes. did you see rain Also correct. Yes, I have. Once. And what did it look like? Must have been funny, right? I liked the sound. And have you seen this thing before? A cow? No. Just an annoying goose. No seriously. She wore dungarees with some kind of pins. And kept asking questions. And have you ever been in love? Why do you want to know so much? Was it you now or not? Hello? Well, uh... No. Damn it can't be. What an idiot! Such a damn idiot. How could I be so stupid? What's your plan? Ah, don't bother me with your plans. That was my plan to find this fucking forest. The plan of a five-year old Apparently they were right from the start I'm crazy. Totally insane. I'm crazy. And what now? Do you want to hide again? And act like nothing happened. are you really that blind That can not be a coincidence. This forest looks exactly like you drew it as a child. That must mean something. something... - Perhaps... - Just leave me alone, okay? - Paul! Paul, wake up! - What's happening! What do we do now? - Is there another exit? - Are all locked. Crap! Are you sure? I checked them all. ok ok ok I have to think for a moment. Do you have a... - What should I have? - Well, a plan. - I have something. - OK. But you won't like it. Go back! OK. I said you should go back! Show it to me. Don't worry, it's worse that it looks. You're such a bad liar Maurizio Now do it! Come on! [Car] Caution! You will soon reach a checkpoint. - Please cooperate. - Oh, please don't. Caution! You will soon reach a checkpoint. Come on, damn shit! Quick, give me the interface. - For what? - Trust me, just give it here! - Where is he? - There! - Where? - Down there! Come on! Have you ever flown with a goose? Elma? Pull up! Elma! Elma! Hey little brother Really strange. Somehow everything always revolves around you. Do you remember what mom used to say? Where is paul? You claimed you were connected. Don't hurt the red moon, leave it alone. Acted like he was mom. The sad thing is, you're the only one who can destroy it. You know father will make you do this. You can't run away forever. You have to end it here and now. Do it Paul - He's right. - He's right. He's right. Only I can destroy him. Only I can destroy him. Not Paul. If I am no more, I cannot destroy him either. I have to save him. Have no fear. Don't be afraid. I can save him Do not do it. Please Paul Eliott, you were in my dream too You weren't you. But I recognized you Everything hurt you like you're dead. I don't want to see the red moon anymore. I don't want to hear the red moon anymore. I know how to remember. Hold on. Elma? Elma. Can you hear me? You're right. I can't run away anymore [Speakers] Start in... Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Lift-off [TV] A truly unexpected turn of events has taken place, dear friend We can hope again. The long-sought Paul appeared out of nowhere, to fulfill his mission. The last nuclear warheads are now about to decide the fate of all mankind. This mission is our last Attempt. Our last chance. So bon voyage, Paul. Bon voyage. Okay, switch to manual control. [Computer] Authorization request for Release of manual control. Permission is hereby granted. The release is hereby granted. Approach is started. Shuttle has entered magnetic field. 10 Percent. 20 Percent. 30 Percent. 40 Percent. 50 Percent. 60 Percent. We're at 70 percent. 80 Percent. 90 percent. The magnetic field has broken. He did it. What happened? Monsieur, we have a problem. We're no longer getting a signal. Take control. Unfortunately that is impossible. The contact is disturbed by the magnetic field. The shuttle changes course. It moves away from the object. Put me through Paul, what's going on? Please answer me. Father... You have to trust me this time. Paul, you can do this Don't abort the mission. He cut off radio contact. The shuttle moves away from the red moon. Monsieur, he has activated the shuttle's self-destruct. Self destruct in: Ten. Nine.
