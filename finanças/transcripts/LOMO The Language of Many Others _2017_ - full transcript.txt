How fast is that? I just think about 2.5 per second, yeah. OK, let's see, that means 150 people per minute. That's 150 people a minute. -Lomo, you there? -My parents said I was special. -They lied. -Another reason to do drugs. When I was born, there were 3.5 billion people. 23, 26... 9,000 per hour. That is more than 200,000 each day. -A small town every day. -Sounds like a pretty big town. Where are you from? That is pretty small. 71, 77, 83... If you watch for a while you get scared. It's like when you focus on your breathing. After a while you start to panic. Say something, Lomo. Don't worry, after you pass out, you'll breathe naturally. Very comforting. And you know what? You'll wake up and panic again. Exactly. We live in one of two states: unconsciousness or panic. Oh God, I hated prom. -What's the new series called? -The world's fucked. -Didn't get the girl? -Very funny. Nice blog. How long have you been doing it? -Two years, maybe. -Unconscious or not, we're slaves. I actually thought it might change something but it didn't. -Impressive how you copy and paste. -They all look so happy. -You're such a romantic. -Why? So what? He's got dreams. WHERE ARE WE GOING ON VACATION? Doro, eight points. I know it's hard to change schools so late, but I hate to tell you, you're totally missing the point. Karl, five points. What you wrote is interesting, but unfortunately it was completely off topic. How come I got six points for readability? -I used the margins you wanted. -Where's the structure? Readability, Doro. I can't read your writing either. Now you're getting malicious. Mitja, read this aloud, please. GREENLAND "Caligula's portrayal... neglects... "his... "ind..." -A little slow, huh? -"Indolent behavior." It's a foreign word. Anybody know what it means? SHE'S SO HOT! "Indolent behavior"? Nobody? Indifferent. Sluggish. STANDARD Are you really that bored, Mr Schalckwyck? You bore yourself, don't you? Excuse me? Excuse me? Oh, ok. Goodbye. Damnit! Fuck! Okay... What? But it's... Huh? Shit. What if it spreads? -Did you know about this? -Huh? Where do I get that? Mom? Okay. I'll just burn the whole world down. That'd be better anyway. Huh? No, I don't think I can. What a load of crap. No, go ahead. Time to eat. I had to hurry to make the deadline. Anyway, I might not even get in. Close your eyes. Keep going. Keep going. Stop! Left. Take your hand off the railing. -Traudel's leaving him. -Porsche Traudel? -Yes. -Keep going. She says it's time to grow up. -Did you remember the mineral water? -It's on my list. Well, that's good. Four more steps. Straight ahead. Stop. Turn. Now real fast. We're in the final round. For the ministry? Then can we have money for vacation? For what? For sleeping bags and camping gear. Let's all take a trip together. I hate camping. You freeze, then sweat, play guitar and stink. You don't have to come. Wine? -Actually we wanted to go with Paul. -Oh, okay. But maybe you can come visit me in Canada. What do you want to study there again? International communications and management. -How much will it cost me? -I don't know. What is that, exactly? International communications and management. If you combine it with politics, you can be a mediator. What then? Then you solve problems. Like international conflicts. You travel around, see new places. Things like that. You could just be a stewardess. Come on. It's great. At 17, I only wanted to make music. And what's your plan? No idea. Well, that's new. I'm good at surprises. -You're one big surprise. -Give him time. Time for what? You'll just get left in the dust. Do you still love each other? Of course. Do you still have sexual intercourse? -Do you still love each other? -Of course. Do you still have sexual intercourse? What the hell? Delete it right away. The blog is anonymous. I don't care! It's my private life! Nobody cares about your private life. -Do you know how naive that is? -Naive? There are three million blogs in Germany. Do you even know anyone who reads blogs? -Bullshit, you know what I mean. -No, I don't. Who cares about you having dinner? Delete it now. Just delete all that crap. Hey. Hey, what's-your-name. It's Karl, right? You're in my German class. Yeah, right. You live here? Yup. Unfortunately. You walking to school? Call Kathrin Schickel. This contact is not available. Oh, no! Not now! Call Kathrin Schickel. -Shit! -Cancel. Call... LOMO: Most people think they're one of a kind. Building Director Dr. Friedrich's office. LOMO: But they're just bacteria in a very ugly dog's intestine. Move the 10:30 to 12:00. Thanks. Sorry. If certain people weren't so slow in the morning, my life would be a lot easier. Won't happen again, Mrs Friedrich. Sorry. -Do you live in the neighborhood? -Yes. A few streets away. A pretty g I have a meeting tonight. Buy yourself dinner. -Got any plans tonight? -You're staying at home, Doro. You won't be there anyway. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thanks. You still mad? THEODORBIGGS: Too bad about the series. I would've had a sad contribution. Hello? You're not going to miss me anyway. Did you like the series? Which one? -The one I had to delete yesterday. -Oh. It wasn't bad, but it's no wonder he got angry. "It wasn't bad" isn't an answer. Tell me what you really think. Why do you always make things so hard on yourself? Hard? Show me how to make things easy. I don't make things easy for myself. I just don't worry like you do. Yeah, you're right. You just dream about walking across Ottawa campus in your trench coat... Come here! No! I'm sorry! Yuck! You're gross! Get off me! THEODORBIGGS: First I thought you were boring. NO-ONE: Have you met Lomo? THEODORBIGGS: Want to get a coffee, Karl? Go away, Anna! LOMO: How do you know LOMO: No idea who that is, freak. THEODORBIGGS: First I thought you were boring. Do you know Lomo? -Is Lomo named Karl? -Maybe it's a classmate. -He's not in school anymore. -Doesn't even have to be one person. -Chill. It's his deal. -We are chill. -He knows us. -How do you know it's not a she? -Of course it's a dude. -Why? -He said he likes girls. -So what? -Who cares if he's a man or woman? -Or a car. -It could be a group. -Or a cake. Yeah, or a project. -I like cake. -Exactly. It does matter. -It does say "of many others." -Lomo, just tell us. -It's none of your business. -At least show us a picture. "Theodorbiggs" is such a shitty name! Who's Theodorbiggs? DESK LAMP. VINTAGE. ORIGINAL! ITEM DESCRIPTION SELLER: THEODORBIGGS THEODORBIGGS: Don't you want to know who I am? MYLIFEISCANCER: No. ANDREYAAAS: Nobody wants to know. LOMO: Maybe I already know. THEODORBIGGS: Oh really? Then who am I? LOMO: A bore. THEODORBIGGS: Then you don't know who I am. SNOOOCH: This is getting painful. LOMO: Maybe I don't want to know. THEODORBIGGS: Coward. LOMO: I'm busy. HEADEXPLODE: Yup. See ya. LOMO: Mayb LOMO: See ya. Hey, what's-your-name. Hey. Am I interrupting... something? No. I was sleeping. Looks like it. Yeah. And who's that? That's Buckminster. Weird name. Yeah, my father is an architect. He was a famous engineer. That's why. You gonna leave me standing out here? No, come in. Do you guys have a lot of money? Sometimes, yeah. Are your parents faithful? You sure? I'll just put some pants on. You can wait in the kitchen if you want. Want a plum? Sure. Thanks. "Buy mineral water" has two exclamation points. Yup. It's very important. My mother rolls the dice till she gets the chore she wants. -Really? -Yeah, really. -Then let's see. -Huh? Let's see. Buy flowers. Do we want to buy flowers? No, I don't want to. -Me neither. -Okay. Taxes. I don't think so. Sauna. Yeah. You guys have a sauna? Yes, in the basement. Want to show me? Right now, or... what? Who was born first, you or your sister? My sister. I was born five minutes later. Did your mother take fertility drugs? I have no idea. Then you'd just be a side effect. Say that again. Then you'd just be a side effect, Karl. Do you think I talk too much? -No. -Do you think I'm boring? I don't know. You know that you look good. So, you're pretty boring, yes. LOMO: to snoooch: It's from the Stone Age, but here's a great clip for unconsciousness or panic. It begins with a scene 1 meter wide which we view from just 1 meter away. Now every ten seconds we will look from ten times farther away. And our field view will be ten times wider. This square is 10 meters wide. And in 10 seconds, the next square will be 10 times as wide. Our picture center on the picnickers even after they've been lost to sight. 100 meters wide. The distance a man can run in 10 seconds. Cars crowd the highway, powerboats lie at their docks. The call for bleachers are soldiers field. This square is a kilometer wide, 1,000 meters. The distance a racing car can travel in 10 seconds. We see the great city on the lake shore. You smell a bit like pussy. Well... Doro was here. What? Who? Doro. Yeah right. She just came by and you guys screwed right away. Seriously? -Maybe. -No way! I knew you thought she was hot too! I don't just think she's hot. It's different somehow. Of course it is. How was it? None of your business. -What happens now? -Paul! Maybe nothing. How should I know? -You'll blow it otherwise. -Give me my phone. What the hell are you doing? -Hey! Paul! -Yeah. What? -Stop! -Give me my phone. Wait a sec. "Tomorrow during the break." "In the gym." -Don't send it! -Why not? Trust me! Just give me my mobile back! -What? -Hey, Paul! Trust me! Don't you want her? But not like that! That's bullshit! Too late. Then I can write one to Anna, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Good. Hey! You've got mail! Mr Schalck-dick! They were fricking huge! -People. -It was gross. This is the last time we walk. Tomorrow we'll be driving. This is historic. People can fail, you know. -What does that mean? -It's a possibility. Okay. Yeah, it's a possibility. Maybe you don't care. Maybe you don't want to travel with us. It's a possibility. Maybe you'd rather see your new girlfriend. -Who? -She's not my girlfriend. Sure, you just screw her in all the breaks. -Who? -Shut up. You're exaggerating. Who is it? Paul? Doro. Doro? Why didn't you tell me? There's nothing to tell. Is that why Paul knows? Yeah, I could smell it. Literally. I don't believe it. Why not? Doro's not your type at all. Isn't she everybody's type? Well, be careful. I hear she doesn't commit to one guy. -How do you do it? -It's a risk you have to take. Help clear the table, please. And did you get the contract? They haven't chosen the winner yet. Even if we had to sell the house, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Yeah, who wants the same house with the same neighbors and the same husband. And how are things with Gregor? He told me he wants to give Phillip his grand piano for his birthday. -It's a real... -Bösendorfer. -Really? -Isn't that nuts? I mean, Philip's not the sharpest kid in the world, not like you. What a terrible thing to say! Horrible! But he really does play beautifully. -Yes, he does. -Right? Didn't you say you wanted to leave him? Leave Gregor? No, it's nice at the moment. Who knows, maybe he'll leave his wife after all. You look more like your dad every day. When I was your age, I quit school and chased some guy to Berlin... Traudel is getting crazier every day. Then my parents disowned me. Oh, not her again. There's a collection of... You should go to the next meeting for me. That woman hates men. Her daughter goes to our school. But Karl knows her better than I do. Is her daughter a tyrant too? I don't think so. ...and the combination of structures... It's got a lot of pickup for what it is, but the emergency brake is weak. Man, the car looks good on her. -Hey. -Hey. -Allow me. -Thank you. It looks really new. It's two years old, but they hardly drove it. Hey! Paul, don't do it, okay? I'm totally doing it. -Hey, Doro. -Hey. Where are we going? I can hardly wait. It's like being swallowed by a big fish, and getting pooped out clean. Ten to the sixth, a one with six zeros. A million meters. Soon, the Earth will show us all its spirit. We are able to see the whole Earth now. Just over a minute along the journey. I don't get the video. I think the blog is dead. So why are you still here? I'd ask you the same thing. He's never been gone this long. I bet he's reading and laughing at us. DUNKEL-ROTE-AUGEN: You there, Lomo? We live in a world that not only needs preserving, but that is also constantly changing. Contemporary architecture must be mindful of both, especially... when it concerns structures for the... Ministries of Environment, Construction... Reactor Safety... Shit! Environment, Conservation, Construction, Reactor Safety. Environment, Conservation... You have to make it into a story. Something like: Environment needs conservation because of construction. Namely, the construction of nuclear reactors. Something like that. Yeah, okay. Get lost. Contemporary architecture must be mindful of both, especially concerning the Ministries of Environment, Conservation, Construction and Nuclear Safety. Can we go to a camping store tomorrow? Depends on how much I drink tonight. You know you have to stay sober, right? Yeah. -You think I'm an amateur? -Yup. I could stay at your place. Isn't that Dad's shirt? Hello. I need to get me one of those shirts. Wanna dance? Now? Want to give me a tour of your house? Fine, then I'll look around myself. Go ahead. -No, no. -That's enough. Have a little more. Once we were the opening band and there were like 1,500 people there. So that was pretty cool. It was before Facebook... How long do you want to keep it a secret? Keep what a secret? Us. What do you mean by "us"? I mean that we sleep with each other all the time. And now you want to have an official girlfriend? Yes. I think... I think that's it. What do you mean "that's it"? I mean we're over. That ruined it for me. What did it ruin? You're just not very experienced yet. And it shows. During sex or what? No. No, all the time. I think you just realized that we're something special. And that scares you. Hey! Asshole. Hello. Hey. Want to get us a drink? Yeah. No, I'm gonna head home. Bye. Fine with me. Five million for that box? I don't get it. You told them that? -Sure, we're colleagues. -But he can't handle it. Hello. Hey! How you doing? Do you want something to eat? No, thanks. Everything okay? My shirt looks good on you. It went really well. They loved it. It's practically a done deal. Not officially. I don't want to jinx it, but... I think we've got the job. It'd be nice not to have to sell the house, right? Um, I might not always show it, but... I'm really proud of you. But you know that. This lonely sea, the galaxy is like dust, is what most of space looks like. This emptiness is... -Lomo's back! -The richness of our own neighborhood is the exception. You okay? Why do people torture cats? Maybe it's part of being human. ...every two seconds. -I feel that way too, man. -Yeah. The fuck video is especially touching. -Delete it now. -Not Theodorbiggs again! Who is Theodorbiggs? -You're such an asshole, Karl. -Why so bitchy? -Is that you in the video? -Maybe she's his girlfriend. -I think she's in the video. -The sauna video? -More like ex-girlfriend. -Lomo is Karl? His name is Karl Schalckwyck. He lives in Berlin. He's a nobody. Why not just give us his bank account number? There's two Karl Schalckwycks on Google. One's a professor. The name sounds South African. Is he South African? Gerd Schalckwyck is a soccer player in South Africa. -"Gerd" is a unit of measure. -Wikipedia junkie. -He's not from South Africa. -He's not a soccer player either. -Did anyone watch the game? -Who cares? -"Gerd" is a girl's name. -Huh? -In Sweden. -His name is Karl. -You're such a coward. -Shut up. You'll regret this. Hello. Crazy shit. Definitely a white man. This is Karl. -No way! -Maybe it's a trick. Is this a new series? He's totally a Kraut. -Did you think his name was Ali? -Why is this relevant? -Is this live? -Hold up two fingers? -Cool. -Nice. -Hello Karl. -Hello Lomo. Nice. You look tired. Yeah. It's eight in the morning and I haven't slept yet. Were you out partying? I've been following you for two years. We need to talk to you. -Come downstairs with your computer. -Yup. I have a bad feeling about this. -Morning, Ms Schalckwyck. -Take us along! -We have to! -Where are we going? How am I supposed to do that? -You know who just called? -Who's that? -Gesine Friedrich. -His parents, idiot. The tribunal. And why do you think she called me? She saw your little work of art. -Did she like it? -Have you lost your fucking mind? Do you have shit for brains? Are my kids so dumb? -Dude! -You know damn well videos like that can ruin lives. -Calm down. Your life or mine? I wish I'd been born 100 years ago. Then I'd just hit you. -Go ahead. -She wants you expelled from school! -Michael stopped her. -Yeah. -He saw the fuck video! -Here's what's gonna happen. Sit down. Sit! -What a dictator! -This is very bad. -Don't put up with that shit. -He can't hear you. You're going to delete the video from your phone, your blog, from your computer, wherever it is. -Do it now. -What's he deleting? Do it. Come on. No coffee, no small talk. You apologize, then we go. Got it? Watch your toes, please. Yes, they're here. He's here too. Okay. She's coming. Where was she? -I don't know. -Why didn't you ask her? -How stupid! -Coffee? -No thanks. -What? They forgot the stool. -What about you? -Yes, thank you. Pardon me, was that a Bösendorfer? Yes, we just sold it. -You know it? -I used to study music. Yeah, it took up so much space. And Doro never played anyway. You can't force anyone to play music. We're really very sorry about all this. I'm sure you're aware of the possible consequences. Karl didn't want to hurt Doro. He was just in love. We deleted it from all his devices. You know it will never disappear from the Internet. Did Karl apologize to Doro? He's here now. So, Karl, have you apologized? When could I? The most upsetting part is that we don't know who saw it. There you are! Where were you? We were waiting. Were you hiding in your room? Hiding? I've been home all day. This isn't about me, anyway. Of course it is. It's about Karl apologizing to you. It's bad enough you saw me fucking. Do we really have to talk about it, too? Didn't you want to say something? We live in a world that not only needs preserving, but also a world for the Ministries of Environment... I think we're wasting our time. Please remove your son from the school. -That's probably best. -Excuse me? -We're going. -Come on, Karl. Wait a sec, okay? -Hey Karl. -Did things calm down? After the shit he pulled, he's lucky to get off so easy. -It's our son's future! -I guess not. And what about the last 20 years of my work? We don't have to do what she says just because she's powerful! Krista, they're in the right. Our son put the video on the Internet. Those are the facts. Fuck the facts! It's our son's future! Theodorbiggs's mom wants me out of the school. You really think showing your contempt for those people helps him? -We were all really impressed! -Stop talking... or I'll puke. -The woman's your dad's boss? -Sort of. My father's job depends on her. He thinks we'll even have to sell our house. So the video is the only thing they've got on you, right? Whoa! What's going on? -Shit, what's going on? -Hello? Why did you stop talking to us? -Because I have no phone. -Mr Schalckwyck. Karl. What is Camus trying to say in this scene? Karl! What is Caligula's problem? Any ideas, Karl? Did he have a hard childhood, or... ADHD or something? No? Let's see how many points you have. Why do I even bother looking. Zero! So, this is your last chance. I see. Okay. Thank you. What about you, Vincent? Hello, Karl. Here. -Is this for me? -Yes. It's a phone, a spy camera and an earpiece with Bluetooth. And your blog has another address now. You'll find it in your messages. KARL, HERE IS YOUR BLOG. Okay, well... Bye! -Ouch! -That was fast! -I told you it'd work. -He can hear us. He's in! Sorry we just moved your blog. First of all, hello. -You're off radar. -Your blog is. But you lost a lot of followers. Sorry. Turn on the camera. The camera. Doesn't it work? Why did we buy cheap crap from Korea? You still there, Karl? I told you he'd hate the idea. -The only thing he hates is you. -Stop it. -Crazy! Cool! -It's working! It works! I'm fucking awesome! -Don't act like it was your idea. -Oh yeah. -I can see him now, too. -Crazy! -Show us where you are, Karl. -What about Theodorbiggs? Don't worry. She didn't make it. Forget her. She's history. -Thanks, everybody. -You sound thrilled. What's wrong, Karl? Still miss her? -You have us now. -You'll never be alone again. -Then lead me home. -What? -Wait, what's happening? -How? Are his eyes closed? -Are your eyes closed? -Go right. -No, left. -Right. -Left. -Straight. -Why are you the boss? -Because you suck. -Find out where he is. -Blindman's bluff! We have lift-off. Does anybody know where he is? Walk a little. Let's see where you are. -Great, a lawn. -Lots of green. -Big help. -A street! -Stay on the path. -No, keep going. -Are your eyes still closed? -Through the bushes? You're doing great. -Straight ahead! -Yeah, straight. -Into the wild. -Cool! -Left! -Shut up. You're fine. Keep going. Work together, people. Stop! -Awesome! -Ouch. -Are you okay? -Fuckers! Watch your language. -You okay? -We got this. Ouch. Right in the balls! -Trust us. -Trust me. -Give him better orders. -Careful. The corner of Ostpreussendamm and Schillerstraße! Got it! -Turn right. -It's clear. -Car! -It's not clear! -Watch out! -Calm down, people. It's funny. -Shut up. -Hilarious. -You survived. -Just keep on walking. -Assholes. -Go left. -Left! -Wrong street! -No, it's right! -You have no idea. Relax everyone, it's just a game. I mean it's funny, but this guy's life we're talking about, here. -Show us your sauna? -Don't be a dick. And... stop. Turn left. -Walk forward slowly. -Just walk to your door. There's the door. -This is where you leave? -Wow! That's your house? Nice neighborhood. Can I move in with you? -There's a table ahead. -Careful! -Straight ahead. -Chair. Have a seat. Home sweet home. Open your eyes. Do you have a brother? I believe just a sister. -That doesn't look like a sister. -Wrong place? -So what. -I told you so! Karl? Do you know who that is? -Karl? -Say something. -I'm Theo. -Hello Theo. I'm Karl. Where did you idiots take him? Can I help you? -No. Thanks. -Fucking awesome! -Hello. -Hello! -This is so fucking weird. -Get out! I guess I forgot a plate. Yeah. -Somebody grab another plate. -Okay! Who are these people? -Why don't they say anything? -What's the address? -Gelforter Straße 3. -I'll check them out. Go! There'll be trouble! You don't look like siblings. They're Mark and Silvia Bodenheimer. Hello, Bodenheimer. Hello, Mr Bodenheimer. -Your name again? -Karl. Yes, please. She's suspicious. -Get her number. -Go! I'll hand out some sauce. Sauce? You're part of the family. I got an email. We can have the house on Corsica. The others backed out. Bon appétit. Corsica again? Bodenheimer's on Instagram. With vacation photos on some mountain called Capu Tafunatu on Corsica. What did he say? Weren't you on Capu Tafunatu last year? Were you there too? Karl, you're messing with us, right? -I forgot the cheese. -I'll get it. It'd be my pleasure. You're the man, Karl! Sure, go ahead. Okay, get out. Get out of there man. -Go, go, go! -Hey, what about her number? Faster, Karl! Take off! -Too bad. I just ordered a pizza. -We could've gone to Corsica! Thanks, guys. You saved my day. See you later. Bye. MAIL! Why did you delete your blog? Did they make you? Congratulations on your acceptance. -Stop it, Karl. -No, it's great! The future starts after graduation, right? I'm happy for you, really. Congrats. Whatever. Holy shit. Give it to me. Hello. Pardon the interruption. It's about a video that was allegedly circulated on the Internet. -Do you know anything about that? -Yes. But the video no longer exists, and it wasn't circulated. -We'll just have a look around? -Of course. -Did you film the video? -No. It was taken with my mobile, but I didn't film it. Can I see your mobile? Unfortunately it's in the canal. -In the canal? -Yes. Anything in your pockets? Excuse me. Is that necessary? You can have my computer. You'll just have to ask my parents where it is. We'd like to have it, yes. Yeah, okay. I'll get it. -Okay. -Then we're done here. -Thanks. Bye. -Goodbye. Give me the phone. -Are you crazy? -Give me the phone, Anna. Thanks. As I said, they'll evaluate the data then you'll hear from the district attorney. -How long will it take? -I'm sorry, but I can't say. And you'll keep the computer till then? Unfortunately, yes. Okay, thanks. Have a nice day. Mrs Friedrich? Schalckwyck here. How frustrated can a person be? Just send the police. Send your lawyers. You don't scare me. Goodbye. What? My son is 17. He's not fully aware of what he's doing. It's another story with my husband. Do you understand? Just ask your husband who he gave his Bösendorfer to. Goodbye. Shit. -Hello? -Hello. Back already? -The cops were just here. -What? -Thanks for saving me. -Don't exaggerate. -I told you guys we had to act. -What did your folks say? My mom's the only one home. She really flipped out. She called Gesine. It was really strange. -She made a copy of the video. -How do you know? -Now we're talking. -Paranoid much? Wanna see? Click this link. -Oh sweet! -Oh my God! -Very old school. -Holy shit. -You hacked the computer. -She did it. -Is it a RAT? -You're no angel. -No way! -But she can't tell, right? You think I'm an idiot? Of course not. -Oops! It's all gone. -Oh, we're sorry! Now we have our fourth slave. The next one should be young and hot. -How did you do it? -You know what a RAT is? -No. -Remote Administration Tool. Send an email, she opens it and it's like a remote control. Our mate is from 10 years ago. -Oh, sweetie. Too tight? -Is she stripping? Welcome to Germany's weirdest home videos. -Nice panties. -I'm gonna have nightmares. -Oh, Mom. -Not found, bitch! It's long gone. She looks pretty frustrated. Not found, bitch. My mom just told her her husband's cheating. It sounds good, it's just so far away. Oh, I'm glad you're still here. There's food in the fridge if you're still hungry. Sorry to barge in like this, but I need company right now. I just got dumped. We don't mind, Traudel. I never thought Gregor would leave me. He always persuaded me to stay. It serves me right. I don't look 21 anymore. Maybe I'll start selling street papers. You won't touch a street paper. Michael! Was it something I said? Sometimes I rub people the wrong way without noticing. And I'll have to sell the grand piano. It's just too big for our living room. Do you want to buy it, Michael? You've got the space. What you really need is to fall flat on your face. You've never accomplished a thing. Maybe this will help. What's your problem? Our son put porn videos of your lover's daughter on the Internet, so now we have to sell our house! -They haven't chosen a proposal yet. -I have my sources. That's how the world goes round. You guys broke or something? Think your dad will kill himself? They do that sometimes. At first, I felt bad about the video. Don't be so hard on yourself. But I don't think I'm the problem anymore. I always think everything's my fault. No matter what happens. What's going on? Where are we going? Where is she coming from? Hey. Hey. -You gonna let me in? -No way. No fucking way! It wasn't my idea to call the cops. I don't give a shit about them. She's lying to you. Did you erase the video everywhere? I knew it. That's why she came. That's why you came, huh? -She is trouble, man. -Tell her to get lost. Maybe you were right. About what? She's fucking with you again. Whatever. I erased the video. So you can go. See ya! Goodbye. Good job. Don't worry. We've covered all the material. -We've got to go. Anna's waiting. -You should be more than prepared. If I gave you any more hints, they'd fire me. I'm not going with you. Just because you're in a bad mood? I'm not graduating, so why should I? Knock it off. Who are you trying to impress? Doro? -Don't kid yourself. -I'm kidding myself? -Yes, you are. -I am? What about you? The childhood sweetheart, your best friend's sister. Stop, Karl. You think that's your dream? You know how many other people have the same dream? The dream of true love. But Anna isn't the love of your life. And this isn't about my sister. This isn't about her. -She's got other plans, trust me. -Karl! What? It's true. You dream of making out with cute college professors. That's bullshit. If you really cared about her, you'd know all this. That's enough. But you're too much of a coward to ask her. And she's too polite to tell you. You don't know she's moving to Canada... Karl! I'm not going anywhere thanks to you, because we're broke! Fuck! Bastard. Didn't you want to be an astronaut? Can I have this? -Sure, you gave it to me. -Thanks. I put all my employees on leave today. It's strange to realize it's not just about you. That other people are affected too. I hear you quit school. Karl? Karl? Everything okay? Everything could've been okay. If we'd taken him out of school I'd still have my office. What the hell are you talking about? If you weren't so focused on yourself and your office, none of this would've happened in the first place. You're not a better parent. Go find a lover in your shitty video game. I want you out of my house. You know what? I think I'll go too. You can have your house to yourself. -Go ahead. -I will! You shouldn't have messed with Gesine's computer. Why? All we did is destroy the evidence. Where will you go if you can't stay home? Yeah, you got a plan? I've got a dog blanket you could live on. -Don't be mean. -It's not mean. I love my dog. Karl? Say something. See you later. I think I'd better go... before your dad wakes up from his stupor. Let's just run away. I'm serious. Where have you always wanted to go? To Greenland. I'll get us money. You don't believe me? I do. I'm going to take off. I'll be at your door tomorrow. -I've got it. -You dealing drugs already? -Hi, is everything okay? -Yeah. I'm supposed to tell you to log in right away. -Okay. -Alright. Bye. Our son finally chose a profession! He's going to be a drug dealer. Oh, this is the life, Krista. Did you find yourself an apartment? How pathetic can you be? But go ahead, pour yourself another glass of wine. What can I do? My wife's been claiming she'll buy mineral water for weeks. Yes? What? No, of course I'm happy! I'm happy! Yes. Um, are you sure? Okay. Thank you. Yes, goodbye. We got the job. We got the job! Oh God! She'll never touch her laptop again. We could drop by, say hi. -What did you guys do? -There he is. -Finally! -Where were you? -Did it work? -He hasn't seen it yet. Michael Schalckwyck gets the contract or this gets sent to all your contacts... Do you all think I'm an idiot? You didn't even think I'd notice my desk lamp was missing, huh? But this? Go ahead and laugh. I risked my job so your old school didn't report you. You're just worried people will find out what a horrible mother you are. -See how you manage on your own. -I will. You don't need to save me anymore, Gesine. Actually I wanted to abort you. Have you heard anything yet? Karl? Did it work? -What do you think? -It worked. -Yes! -There was a huge debate, but... The person you are calling is temporarily unavailable. Fuck off or I'll smash your face in! Fuck off! I know you're awake. Hey. Hey. Have you seen Doro? Have you lost it or something? You really think you're the only person who's ever fallen in love? What? It doesn't compare. What? The thing with you and Paul. If only you knew what an asshole you've become. Doro's going to be there tonight, by the way. Okay, everybody. You've got to move in closer, or you won't be in the picture. Now kneel down. Want to kneel on something? My jacket, maybe? Okay, you guys look great. CLASS OF 2016 Touching! -Traudel's got a new lover already. -Really? -Yup. -Let's hope he doesn't have kids. It was brave of you to come. I like that you're so stubborn. You'll do just fine. Anna, to you. To your future. Mrs Friedrich, we're very happy about the committee's decision. -How dare you. -Pardon? What do you mean? -Tell him what his son did. -That little shit blackmailed us! We can still run away, right? Doro, I had nothing to do with it, okay? Doro, I had no idea! -Karl? -Is he back? -So, what can we do for you? -Don't be so childish. -He doesn't care about you guys. -Yes, I do. I'd be nothing without you guys. Lead me. Blindman's bluff again? -Are your eyes closed? -Sweet! Okay, go ahead. -You can't be serious. -Stop! Watch it! -Lead him! -Get off the street! -Left, go left! -Go there, idiot! -Not that way! -Karl! -Oh fuck! -Karl? Are you hurt? -It's not funny anymore. -He's just messing with you. Hello? -Is he suicidal? -He's not that broken. -He needs our help. -Yeah, "he needs our help!" -Man, what a freak! -Don't listen to him. Get up! Get up! -Now, straight ahead. -Knock it off, Andreas. Stop walking and open your eyes. -I don't think he wants to go home. -No, really? -He's gonna kill himself. -Never. -What are you trying to prove? -Go left. -Go straight! -There's a wall there! -Great. -Oops, sorry! You guys suck! Stop listening to those idiots, Karl. Open your eyes, Karl! -He doesn't listen to you. -No. It's your fault he's doing this! -You should all just log off. -You can't all just go! Don't be so selfish. -I'm out. -Me too. -Bye. -Bite me! -What's that in front of us? -The light at the end of the tunnel. -Have you guys lost it? Karl! -Karl, look where you are, man! I'll run you over myself if you don't stop! -You'll kill him! -Wake up! -What if he dies? -Then it's his own fault. -He's gonna kill himself! -Fuck! Stop! -You sick bastards! -Shit! -What are you doing, stop that! -Karl, no! -What kind of a loser are you? -Open your eyes! -You nuts? -Just do it. -Die, you bastard! -You're psychopaths! -Relax, it's almost over. -This is some sick shit! -Is he dead? -Is the camera broken? -Turn the camera on! -Hurry up, I've got to take a shit. I love you. We live in one of two states: unconsciousness or panic. But don't worry, after you pass out, you'll breathe naturally. BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Annie Grossjohann
