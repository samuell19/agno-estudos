Okay, so here's everything you need to know. My name is George. I've worked in the entertainment business for, let's say, a long, long time, first as an agent, then as a manager with my best friend, Howie West, and then we became producers. We did pretty well for ourselves. But this movie isn't about any of that. This is about the place where I grew up, and how incredibly important those roots are to me. All my closest friendships, including with Howie, were formed there over 80 years ago. Other than my family, those friendships were the greatest blessing of my life. But then recently, Howie died... And it got me thinking about the neighborhood where it all started.

But I don't usually go back to the old neighborhood. It's been years, actually. But after Howie passed, I wanted to see it again and walk the streets where we all used to play. It's funny that even after all these years, I still feel such a connection to it. What is it about the Bronx? The Bronx. The Bronx is one of five boroughs of New York City. It is the northernmost one just north of Manhattan. It's the only borough on the mainland of the United States. It's also on the Harlem River. We have Fordham University, we have the Bronx Zoo, and we have Yankee Stadium. It's the only borough that has an article in front of it. You don't say "the Manhattan." You don't say "the Brooklyn." Only "the Bronx." Why is that? Because it was the farm of the Bronck family. So when you went up to visit, you went up to the Bronck's. It's tremendously mixed ethnicities, tremendous amount of tolerance. What I knew as a kid was Italian, Jewish, some Asian. My neighborhood in the Bronx, it was mostly Puerto Ricans and blacks, but now it's just everybody's in the Bronx. And you had to deal with all these different races, religions, backgrounds, cultures. You pick up quite a bit of street sense. The Bronx has a reputation of being a very tough place and some places absolutely dangerous. When I tell people I still live in the Bronx they go, "You still live in the Bronx?" People's image of the Bronx was the South Bronx, and even the South Bronx now is going through a renaissance. Salsa, doo-wop, hip-hop, it all came from the Bronx. Could be coincidence, but it might just be something magic happening in the Bronx. There might be something in the water. It was like a movie set. It was all alive all the time. The Bronx is a place where you plant seeds and friendships grow. The Bronx is sort of like a tattoo, you know? You get it and no matter where you go, it's gonna stay there. Since I was heading back to the old neighborhood, I thought it would be fun to explore it with one of my oldest friends, Carl Golub. - Who's that? Who's that? - Carlie! - Hey! - Look at... - There he is. - Hi, Carl. One and only. I've known Carl since we were four. Mosholu Parkway... nature made it into a very lovely area because it's got wide streets, lots of trees, lots of places for kids to play. I got a big kick out of walking around there, but I can't say that I captured the same spirit that George captured. Ah, that's the sound. That's the sound I used to sleep to... the sound of the trains. It was like a lullaby that put me to sleep. Carl and I walked in that neighborhood, and it was just the warmest, most connective feeling. You flash back. See that right across the street? That's where the candy store was. We used to sit there eating candy, having egg creams and ice cream sodas. Right, right. But we spent a lot of time buying comics. 10¢ were the comic books, and Howard and I chipped in 5¢ each. And we got the first "Action Comics" where Superman was introduced. - Yeah. It's only worth about $2 million now. Of course, we... 10¢, Howard and I could've split that $2 million. We used to go sleigh riding right down these hills. Do you remember cutting people off? Of course. That was one of the triumphs. You know, cut them off and flip over their... - Right, flip over their sleds. - Their sleds. - We were violent. - Yeah. The kind of fun you have as a child is irreplaceable. We spent six, seven hours a day planning to have fun. It's unbelievable. That's what helped make us, I think... I really do. When we've looked back on our lives, we don't see anything that was bad. Yeah. We grew up during the depression. That wasn't so good. We grew up during World War II. That wasn't so good. But if you ask us, did we have a good life, a good time from the time we were little children, the answer's empathetically yes 'cause we had so much goddamn fun. We lived in this neighborhood for 20 years. It doesn't happen anymore. Everything is transient in the world today. People don't have that... the bond that we had. Times have changed. I asked my grandchildren do they have lasting friendship, and most of them have maybe one friend that they're still friendly with. We had 13 friends that stayed friendly growing up and into our adulthood. The only thing that stopped us from being friends was death. This is definitely... To be from the Bronx... how do I describe that? Our pizza is the best out of all of the boroughs. Coming from the Bronx, I would definitely say it's a different experience. The Bronx is kind of a strange place, but it's a good place. We have so much culture and so much history behind us. It's a place with its good and its bad, but, you know, a lot of people tend to see the negatives because, you know, it is an inner city. A lot of the people I know come from very poor backgrounds, and we don't have much, but we make it look like we have a lot. And having friends helps with getting over those hurdles. I am student body president, and I am very involved in student activities, but I have a close group of friends that I actually can, like, not be president around, so... So I would say friends are people that I can be myself with and don't have to worry about being judged. You cannot comment any longer. A friend is somebody you can laugh with, crack jokes with, somebody who wants to hear your problems at any time, doesn't matter when. People you can spend time with for no reason... it don't gotta be anything special, just hang out with. And those are real friends. 'Cause sometimes you just need to hear what your friends think. It gives you that perspective that nobody else will give you that really helps you out. I'm a very shy person, so, you know, I'm very introverted. But I feel like it could be, like, 60 years down the line. I'm still gonna remember these people. What do you mean, remember? Shut up. ♪ There's no way to hold me ♪ You didn't do it right. ♪ No more hiding who I wanna be ♪ I'm from Ghana. I lived there for 13 years. And when people make fun of me because of my accent, my friends used to stand up for me. So my definition of friendship is, a person you could always turn to, someone you could share memories with, and just someone who's always there for you basically. We're not one of those friendships that are only school, so that effortlessness of trying to be around each other will still stick around 'cause it's sticked around for the past four years. That corner on Jerome Avenue and Mosholu Parkway was Mosholu Cafeteria... quite a spacious cafeteria. We used to go for a sandwich and soda and it was 35¢. And that's where we all went. Like, six of us friends, went into the army on the same day. It was October 20, 1953. I have a great picture of our company at Fort Dix. 'Cause Carl was in it, and Carl was so cute. He's like Rob Lowe today. That's how Carl looked in those pictures. I missed my occupation. Now here's where the barbershop was. Hello. This was my first barbershop. - Okay. The barber was named Frank Marciello. So it has nostalgia. I'm 85 now. - I know. - And I got my first haircut... you know? - Yeah. You know you're 85, right? - Yeah. So that's 81 years ago... - Yeah. I started getting haircuts in this barbershop. So it touches my heart. Nice to meet you. I'm George. - My name is Gabriel. - Gabriel, nice to see you. Frank Marciello lives! The Bronx today is very different than it was when we grew up. I think the word "neighborhood" is dying now. There are no more neighborhoods. So I want people to see what it was like to live in a neighborhood, to grow up in a neighborhood, and take the good and bad. It was a place where you had roots. You know? The families knew each other. We all came from apartment houses. The whole family... my cousins, my aunts, my uncle... we all lived in the same building. We'd run up to the sixth floor every Sunday 'cause my Aunt Sylvia would make pancakes and, you know, my Uncle Eddie would tell us stories. No doors were locked, and so I, as a five year old, would wander the hallway to our neighbor's apartment, the Mednicks, and my job as a toddler was to climb behind Irving Mednick while he was watching the Yankees. And I would just comb... His one hair. You kind of knew people's business in a way, although you pretended in the elevator that, you know, "Hi, how are you?" So there was a concentration of people. It was recreating this idea of village kind of living, and that's, I think, the way people are meant to live. I keep coming back to what it was like in the summer with all the neighbors sleeping on the fire escapes. - And you're waving to people. You're talking. You see who's out in the street, right? And if you wanted a sunburn, you went up on the roof and it was called tar beach. That's right. You could see the school. You could see all of the stores. You saw the grandmas taking care of the kids. You saw the parents who worked coming home at dinnertime. The Bronx was very provincial. You know, there was the South Bronx and there was the rest of the Bronx. We didn't care about the rest of the Bronx. We only cared about Kelly Street. I remember sitting on my stoop and I could see the roof of the telephone building on West Farms Square, and to the left the water tower of the RKO Chester Theater, and I thought that was the end of the world. But you didn't venture forth unless you had a special occasion. Because there was no point... In foraying out into the world. The main shopping street had everything in terms of food, pharmaceuticals. They were all one store after the other, little mom and pop stores. On one corner was a Jewish drugstore. Another corner was a Jewish bakery. There was a bodega, uh... Puerto Ricans. There was a Chinese laundry. There were no supermarkets. There were no plastic bags. Women had shopping carts. I say women. Occasionally, a man did the shopping once every 70 years. We ate at Schuler's, which is a famous restaurant there, and we ate all kinds of heavy meals at 12:00, 1:00 in the morning. Corn beef sandwich or a pastrami sandwich. Hot roast beef sandwich. One of them was so rich that the order came with a cardiologist. On Monday mornings, all the kids would be talking about which Chinese restaurant they went to the night before. We didn't go to Chinese restaurants 'cause my mother was kosher. She used to serve sliced onions to my father, you know, real onions that made you cry. I couldn't touch them. So I said to my mother, "All my friends are talking about "going to Chinese restaurants on Sunday night. Can we go?" And my mother said, "It's got onions. You wouldn't like it." - Aww. He's sweet. He was like, "Come on." Danielle is the youngest one, but she's the mother figure. She tries to help each and every single one of us out some way, somehow, and it's, like, we need counseling, "Oh, okay. Come here. Come sit down. Come talk to mama." What? You the youngest. When I'm not raising all of them or when I'm not planning events for all of them, I'm usually doing a lot of student work at school... 'Cause you're a nerd. - 'Cause I'm the president. - A nerd. I have to do a lot of student government activities, like, if there's events happening, and some things like that. I wanna talk to you about the end-of-the-year things I need for you to do. - Mm-kay. Usually, I'm either in meetings back to back all day. Graduation rehearsal, cap and gown distribution, the actual graduation and diploma distribution. Just run them through the whole thing. Also, it's very important that you're at the rehearsal on time. Don't come in late. Everybody's gonna see you. You know, you wanna represent. I usually try to stay after school to get some of my work done or to get my homework done before going home. Why are you spinning it? You committed two hours? I didn't commit yet. Yeah, I'm trying to fit in. Me and Danielle actually talked about us getting old together. She's convinced she's gonna die before me. Yeah... So I made her in charge of my funeral arrangements, right... So she knows what songs to play at my funeral, right? She knows exactly what to say. - Play rap music. Don't. She gonna play "Hamilton" at your... - "Hamilton" and Disney songs. - "Hamilton." We're playing the Wu-Tang Clan. That's what we're doing for your funeral. I have a lot of worries... because I'm the oldest child in my family. - You're off to work. - Yeah. We're an immigrant family. I'm the first generation. I'm expected to attend college but work. It's a little scary having that responsibility. I will have to help my mom and help my sister and it'll be on me. It won't be in a group of people. It'll be all on me. I share my worries with my friends and they will say, "I have your back. You can call me anytime." And I just... I'm definitely gonna call them when I'm stressed out. There was another one. One of the places I was most excited about seeing was the building where I had lived when I was a little boy. Wow. This is amazing. I moved there when I was four years old over 80 years ago, and they kept it up so it looks exactly the same. This lobby looked bigger when I was a kid. - Oh, my God. - And there's the elevator. There was an elevator operator that had the elevator... How the hell did you have an elevator in this building? - Fancy building. - Very rare. - Oh. - Very rare. This was the first apartment, 1D, and I was in 1F. Gonna knock on the door. Thank you for letting me in. - I'm Georgie. - Hello, I'm Joan. How are you? - You live in my apartment. - Yes, I do. - Oh, I love you. - Thank you. - Yes. In California, and... in California. I was smiling the whole time, and the people that were living there were so gracious. Wow. What a nice kitchen. I was here from the age of 4 to 11. I remember my mom made very good food. She made leg of lamb that was delicious and brisket of beef. My mom and dad were very much in love with each other, and I remember my mother would wash the dishes and my father would dry the dishes. And they used to kiss each other. They'd, like, hug each other in between the dishes. George, where were your parents born? Well, my mother's mother, they were from Poland. - Yeah, my father was Russian. - My father was Russian and my mother was from Poland. - Yeah, same thing. My father was Russian and my mother was from Poland. Same thing... yeah, but are you sure you're not my brother? I feel like we are brothers. I shared a room with my brother, which was not pleasant 'cause he was four years older than me. He used to beat me up. Once, Howard walked into my apartment. My brother was so mad at me 'cause I... maybe provoked him a little. So anyway, he threw a hardball at my head, but I ducked, and Howard opens the door just as the hardball goes right by his ear and shatters the plaster on the wall. And I went through Howard's legs and I ran down the street. I know how lucky I am. Look at the view that I had as a kid. Mosholu Parkway. Carl, look at those trees. I used to walk into this apartment five, six, seven, eight years old, and just feel love here. But as great as it was to see the old apartment, I somehow still felt like I was missing something. Okay, let's go back out to the streets of the Bronx. Whatever I was looking for when I came to the Bronx... I hadn't quite found it yet. I definitely think that there's something special coming from the Bronx. I walk out to one side of my block and I'm in, like, a mostly Spanish area. I walk to a different side of my block, and then a mostly Jamaican area, and if I go out just a little further, it's predominantly, like, Albanian. The history of the community was an immigrant community. Every kid that I grew up with was first generation. We all came from immigrant parents. Originally, I'm not from here, but this is the left I've known. This is where I grew up since I was maybe six years old. It wasn't really a melting pot to be honest with you when we grew up. It was mostly all Italian. We had a lot of diversity with tall Jews and short Jews. However, across the street, there was a mix. And it was crazy because on one half of the block you had us, you know, the people who looked like myself, and then on the other side of the block were the Italians. But the block was still unified, believe it or not. In school, we met one another. I have friends that are not only Jamaican as me, but they're Puerto Rican, Cuban, Colombian, Dominican, Guyanese. There's so much diversity in the Bronx that makes us, you know, one whole. My first work experience was in the Bronx when a Jewish toy store owner came out and said to me... I was walking up Westchester Avenue... "New kid, you wanna work?" And I worked for him for the next seven years on and off. I was essentially what you would call in Yiddish, a "schlepper," you know, you move stuff. One day, he called me inside and he put his arm on my shoulder and he said, "Colin, I need to tell you something. "When I go, this store goes to my daughter and my son-in-law. "I don't want you should think that you have any future here. "You don't. "You're a good worker, but get your education and do something with yourself." It so moved me. He cared enough about me to tell me that. I was an only child for 16 years, and my parents just had twins. So it's kinda really hard because... when my parents are not home, I have to babysit. So I can't really do everything else everyone does. I can't really go out as much because I usually babysit till my parents come home. Looking after them is kind of really hard because when he's doing something, she likes to walk around and go in the kitchen, which is a dangerous place. They're both one year old... And I'm trying to hold them together, and it's... it's like... I don't know what I'm doing. It's kind of stressful, but it's a learning experience as well. I feel like I'm learning more about responsibility and how to take care of somebody else other than myself, so it's really kind of cool and frustrating at the same time. I started school at Fordham in the Bronx campus in 1952, and I never saw much of the Bronx. I was a mile away from Arthur Avenue. I would've gone there every night and had spaghetti. I didn't know about Arthur Avenue. I stayed on the campus. I was cloistered. But in my final year, I met Arlene, who came from the Bronx... the greatest thing the Bronx has ever produced. - Hardly. - No, no, no. You can have Colin Powell. I'll take Arlene. That sounds like Alan. We courted in the Bronx, and there was a real Bronx thing about our dating relationship. I'd visit her parents' apartment in the Bronx. And then at about midnight, I'd be heading back to get on the subway to go to Manhattan, which was an hour away. Arlene would give me rye bread to put in my pocket in case I got hungry on the way home. But on the way home, I would fall asleep. It was so late. I'd wake up in Brooklyn with stale bread in my pocket. Weeks later, I'd reach into my pocket and I'd get a piece of stale rye bread. Arlene came to visit on my graduation, and she's the one who made me go to the graduation. I was trying to be cool about the whole thing, and I thought, what's the point of going to a graduation, a meaningless ceremony. She said, "No, it's important. Go to your graduation. I'll come. I'll be there with you." And I'm glad we did 'cause we got a nice picture out of it. Now we're gonna go on Kossuth Avenue. This is where Howard lived. - Howard's building. - That's his building. - Yep. It's still the same color. 3320 Kossuth Ave, the house of Howard West. - Howard lived on this... - I love you, Howie! I love you, Barbara Goodman. - Barbara Tannenbaum. Tannenbaum. Barbara Tannenbaum. - No... I'm sorry. Barbara Tannenbaum. She was right in that first... that window to the right, the second story. First window to the right. She taught me to do the lindy hop, you know, and she taught me. And we used to serenade her.

You know, we had great groups like the Puerto Rican All Stars and all of this activity happening in the South Bronx. This music that if you didn't know firsthand, you would've missed this rich soil of great music coming out of the Bronx. I heard my first Latin band, and I just fell in love with that music. And then I got into it. I started writing it, playing it. I don't know where those sounds came from, those apartment walls. He was 15 pretending to be 16 playing in Latin bands, and our father financed his first salsa record, which is pretty amazing when you think about an old Jewish guy coming from Poland financing a salsa record. Most of my friendships in the Bronx were musically based. I had this band called Mystic Funk, and the band was a guitar player named Wilfred Lomris, Ronald Sergeant on bass, and Joe Phillips on tenor saxophone. And we did our first show at the school for an assembly. And we were going to play Donny Hathaway's "The Ghetto." And now, if you know the song, "The Ghetto" is really based on a bassline. ♪ Boom, boo-boo-boo-boo-boom ♪ ♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom ♪ So we're there, and we get introduced, and my friend Ronald gets massive stage fright and will not go on the stage. You're the bass player. I mean, you got... the whole thing with this is the bass, you gotta... He just won't budge. He's just, like... he's petrified. Now we have to go out. And so, Wilfred being a great guitar player, he'd play the line and lead and everything, and Joe being very savvy played the bassline on the tenor saxophone at the beginning and then went into the solo, and I don't know. I kind of blacked out after that. But all I know is, before that, we were just some regular guys, and after that, we were the three most popular people in the school. And I said, "This is what I gotta do." I love music with a passion. It's like an extension of myself. It's really a big part of my life. I analyze music all the time. I read articles about music, listen to podcasts about music. It helps me with everything. If I'm in a bad mood, I go to music. If I wanna think about something, I go to music. If I wanna talk to my friends about something, probably talking about music. I have a lot of dreams in life. My main one is being a rapper. Me, my friend Alexander, and my cousin Cleje we've been friends since freshman year of high school. We hit it off 'cause we have so much things in common. I like rap music, and he told me about certain people who I should listen to. Hip-hop came from the Bronx, so it's not really just a genre of music, but it's a culture that people created during tough times. Me, Alexander, Javid, we work on songs together. ♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun ♪ ♪ I'm coming for the heads of everybody of the rap game ♪ ♪ I'm otherworldly ♪ ♪ A man hunting for more is born way too, way too early ♪ ♪ My words are way too sick ♪ ♪ Moving through the competition ♪ ♪ I condense and shift ♪ ♪ I'm mentally quick, I'm ethereal ♪ In today's musical age, people don't really value music as much anymore 'cause you can just illegally download it. I was like, if I want to become a artist in the future, I want people to support my music and buy my music. So I started buying music. Quincy Jones? How did I miss this? I like talking to, like, the old generation of people 'cause I feel like they have, like, a better insight on certain things 'cause they've already experienced life. So I heard that you're rapping, right? - Yeah, I rap. - Yeah? What kind of rap do you do? I rap about kinda, like, social stuff. Yeah. Maybe things that I think that are, like, honest and real. - You play an instrument? - No. I mean, in school, I'm doing piano right now. It's important that you play an instrument, you see? Because not only the ideas come to your head. - Mm-hmm. - You'll be able to write. You'll be able to think. You'll be able to see things musically when you start playing an instrument. You understand? - Yeah. And eventually, you'll find your own range. Good luck in your future. - Thank you. And remember, learn to play an instrument. The main reason why relationships from the Bronx last for so long, there's no BS. People don't give a rat's ass about what you've done with your life in terms of success. They just know you for who you are. It's easy to be a friend when times are great, but it's important to be a friend when it costs you something. That's when you know you have somebody who's loyal and is a real friend. Real friends pass throughout the years, and no matter what it was, even if you fell out a little bit, but you know, it was always good. You could come back to it. And we had this bond with each other. We would fight together. We would win together. We would lose together. We would love together. We did everything together. So I think when you have those bonds, you keep that for the rest of your life. ♪ Those were the days ♪ ♪ That we laugh about ♪ ♪ We fought and played and worked it out ♪ My friends and I have kept those bonds strong for over 80 years. We call ourselves the Bronx Boys. ♪ Those were the days ♪ Every five years, we get together to celebrate our friendship, and we have fun.

The way I stay connected to the Bronx is I go back there. I go to the Bronx once a month, sometimes twice a month. I go shopping. - It's the best in the world. - See this store? When I was a kid, I used to come here. Chris. - How are you? I gotta come here and get my fix. - You got it. How are you, brother? - How are you, brother? Good to see you. Let me tell you something. My wife knows when I come down here. She loves it, but she hates it. 'Cause she knows when I come down here and I go shopping, instead of an hour trip, I'm down here for five hours. She calls me up, "Where are you?" I'm eating the bread. I'm eating the cannolis. I never come back. Give me another one, a small slice. - We have only large. - Give me the large. This is the famous Arthur Avenue, folks. - Hey, how are you, guys? - How you doing? There he is. Your father started it. 102 years. You want tomatoes, olive oil? Right here. You come right here. Tidal Brothers. The Bronx is a forgotten borough. People, you know, they remember "Fort Apache," and it's not like that. The Bronx is great. Mozzarell... best mozzarella in the whole world. Best raviolis in the world. Best cannolis in the whole world. Right here. This is it. And here's the key. He makes them fresh. - On order. - On order. And there is the cappuccino queen. Let me show you my pastry over here. The Chazz. - The Chazz. The streets of the Bronx... I love these streets. We own the streets, Carlie. - Yeah. We own the streets of the Bronx since we're five years old. We probably played a minimum of 50 to 100 different games. Carl remembers all of the games we played. - All the games. The fast one, the ring-a-levio, cord, cord, cord. - And flipping cards. - Flip the cards. We should've saved those baseball cards. Do you remember Johnny on the Pony? - Of course, of course. - One, two, three. Johnny on the Pony, that was... It was an extraordinary childhood. I mean, I wouldn't have traded it for anything, and it's different how I see my kids didn't have the same childhood that I had. We would just walk out the door and we had 20 kids to play with. There were 86 families in my building. When I wanted to play, I'd go down the hall to Phillip, or I'd go two down to Mitchell. We didn't make playdates. There was no such thing as a playdate. We'd just go call for each other. "You free? You free" - I would go up the street, and Camille lived on the sixth floor, and I would yell out, "Camille's mother, can Camille come down to play?" That's how we found each other. Or there was always kids out there, so you could always just play with whoever was out there. And parents were around, but I mean, it wasn't... there was no kind of worry. All of us probably never played with a uniform. I don't think my mother ever saw me throw a baseball. You know, it was just something we did. We painted a football field in the middle of our street, a baseball diamond in the middle of our street. - I loved playing King. - What's King? King was when you... you used the sidewalk as boxes. And you hit the ball, and it had to go into the box next to you. - Oh. So why was it called King? You become the king. We played dodgeball. We played Run, Catch, and Kiss. We even made up a few games that got us on punishment. In the winter, we would play Mum Freeze. We would get in the hallway because it was freezing and we would start punching somebody... not in the face. You weren't allowed to hit in the face. That was the rule... and really beat somebody up. And then he would go, "One, two, three, mum freeze," and then we had to freeze. And then as soon as one person moved, he would say, "Phil." And then everybody would start beating him up until he said, "One, two, three, mum freeze." This is the way we'd kill the night sometimes. We played, like, ring-o-levio, you know, Freeze Tag, Johnny on the Pony. Johnny on the Pony killed us. Talk about getting your aggressions out. - Johnny on the Pony. - Oh. - Remember that? - Yes. Johnny on the Pony is one guy was, like... - Oh, my God. - He would lean against the wall. Somebody would grab the lamppost and hug it. And then there would be people lined up. One by one by one, we'd hang onto each other like this. Each one got their head under the person's legs, so there was like a pony. And other guys would run and jump. And land on the three guys. And you'd try to hold them up, and they would try to knock you down. The boys would just start jumping on everybody's back. I mean, it was crazy. If you had a pink Spalding ball, you could play stoopball, which is throwing the ball against the stoop and that, you could play punchball. You could play stickball. And stickball, you played with a broom handle. Stickball was a game you played in the street. There were one or two cars on the side, and we used to use them as bases. First base was this car, - and second base was that car. - Right. If you hit a certain distance, that's a single, a certain other distance, double, all the way to a home run. The big thing about Stickball was whoever could hit three sewers, right, Phil? If you could hit three sewers... - It was a big deal. - You were a big deal. You were a hitter if you could hit three sewers. If I didn't strike out, I could do three sewers. And you know what? We played in the street and cars would come. We'd say, "All right, come on, come on." But we would actually hold the cars up. Yeah. And people would wait 'cause they understood. - Stickball was important. - Stickball was important. With a stick, you'd break windows, so people would call the cops. And when somebody would see a cop car turning into the street, somebody would say, "Cops, cops," and the guy with the stick would throw the stick under the car. And we would turn the game into a punchball game. Nobody minded punchball 'cause you couldn't break the windows. I didn't know you were a criminal, Oscar. I don't recall yelling, "Cops, cops." Carl and I walked down the block to our old elementary school, PS80. These days, it's a middle school. Carl Golub is entering the room. - Ta-da. - Carl Golub. We'd been invited to talk to the kids about stickball. So we went in there with the stick and the Spalding ball and I asked the kids... Did you'd ever play stickball or no? - No. - They don't. It disappeared. I don't know what happened. When Carl and I lived right on Mosholu Parkway, the street right where PS80, one of the things we did because we didn't have room to play was playing stickball right in the street. There was awkwardness because they'd never heard of stickball. I mean, to us, I was shocked that they never heard of it. So someone would pitch, and if I hit anyone in the head, I apologize. I'm sorry in advance if I hit anyone in the head. Stickball is a simple game, but explaining it was surprisingly hard. There's two variations of stickball. One was you played it out in the street, but you had to get a broomstick. I started to feel that maybe this was not such a good idea. And the ball, and creativity... Honestly, the kids just looked bored. And it got to me. What are we doing here? They don't care about stickball. Why are we doing this? I just felt there was no connection. But then... I threw up the ball and I whacked it and they came to life a little bit. There was a sparkle in their eyes. They said, "Let's try this." Okay, who's the first batter? Okay, here's the deal. You take that stick, keep your eye on the ball, and whack it. Batter up. Wide. - Very good, very nice hit. - Come on, come on. The amazing part was that they took to it immediately, and they loved it. Whoa. It's dangerous. - Did you see that? - He's dangerous. Swinging too hard. It's a tough game. Stickball's a tough game. - Oh. Very, very good. - They're doing good. You guys are doing good. Keep your eye on the ball. Come on! - Whoa. Double. You guys are great! Whoa! - Whoa. - He broke the bat. This bat is too thin. Way to go, way to go, way to go! Next team. Don't swing as hard as the other team is swinging. Just try to make contact. They're all trying to kill it, right? Don't kill it. Good, that's it. There you go. Good hit. My team is red hot. Oh! - They really got into the game. I can't believe it. I thought they would be bored with it. Whoo! You meet a lot of unlikely characters in the Bronx. - Oh. - Oh, my God. Oh, God, the Bronx is full of strange people... - Yes. - At all times of the day. That's the best thing about friends. You go through the same traumatic experiences together. - Yeah. But it always happens when we're with Javid, though. Always with Javid. Javid had the baddest luck. Today... what, you got a switchblade pulled on you? Some guy was talking about "we had to defend ourselves" and he pulled out a switchblade to show us that he had one. And me and Alexander were just like, "What's wrong with this guy?" Yeah, he was like the ghetto Mr. Miyagi. Starting in the 1960s through about the '80s, the quality of life in the Bronx really started to go down. The deterioration of my neighborhood was painful to watch. When you first saw the drugs come into the neighborhood, you saw kids dropping out of school, and then the buildings started to deteriorate. And as they deteriorated, junkies came and took out all the plumbing and the piping. And then when they were through with that, they set fire to the buildings. Growing up in the Bronx, it was a lot of drugs, you know, that was, like, heroin. Then after heroin came cocaine. So it was like... almost like a horror movie. So you start from nothing. You're in the armpit of the country. So you'd just be caught up in, am I gonna sell dope? Am I gonna use dope? Am I gonna go to jail? Am I gonna rob store? So you had to be about something. You had to make it about something. ♪ Grow in the ghetto living second-rate ♪ ♪ And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate ♪ ♪ The places you play and where you stay ♪ ♪ Looks like one great big alleyway ♪ But once the music came about, it was about, okay, yeah, well, we got a party this weekend. You know, I'ma go to this jam and, you know, you got dance moves, So you're thinking about practicing your dance moves. You had B-boys. You had graffiti. And then emceeing evolved and, you know, DJ-ing evolved. So instead of just living in the hood and being a product of your environment, all of those things became, this is our thing to do. Hip-hop actually became a form of rebelling against what society was trying to shove our way. We sort of reinvented ourselves, reinvented culture. It's kind of like what punk music was like in England, you know? It was like a social thing. It wasn't just a musical thing. It's a sociological explosion. The buzz was going around, you know? We was all going to different house parties. And we had that swagger. We called it the boogie down. My dancing was my get high. I was DJ-ing at that time, you know, doing house parties, and then it led into a career. And that's the beauty of the Bronx. It created opportunities for people like Melvin, Darryl, and myself. It was the beginning of something that changed lives all over the world. And it started right in the Bronx, and that's one thing nobody can take from us. You know the song that me, him, and her, and a couple other friends did called "Black Lives Matter." - Oh. - That's a good song too. Yeah, I'll just probably sing the chorus whenever you're done. I can't remember the first line. I don't know the song. ♪ Black lives matter, it's mind over matter ♪ ♪ Trying to get into the swings of things ♪ ♪ They curveball and batters ♪ ♪ Wanna sing what they can but gettin' harder for freedom ♪ Aw, see, I messed up already. I can't remember all of it. You can do it. - You can do it too. - Your part. You had a verse on the song too. Yeah, rap your verse. - I did not. Go ahead, Alex. And the chor... And the chorus goes, ♪ Black lives matter ♪ ♪ Walk through Ferguson with my hands up ♪ ♪ They matter ♪ ♪ I said can't breathe, officer ♪ ♪ I said I had no gun ♪ ♪ It wasn't real even though you made me run ♪ ♪ Fists up for all the people we lost to hate crime ♪ ♪ Fists up for justice, it will soon be our time ♪ ♪ Fists up for all the people we lost to hate crime ♪ I love color. If I can bring the rainbow into my pocket, I would use it. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Uh ♪ I was 13 years old when I started doing this stuff on the walls and subways. Growing up in the South Bronx, everyone was trying to outshine each other. ♪ Ooh ♪ - You had the DJs. You had the break dancers. You had the graffiti. You know, you had everything sort of bubbling at the same time. And here I am, you know, kid who loved jazz, who just painted, so what better than just doing my name really big? And you get some sort of street cred. If you're out there doing your name on a wall, to me, you're always trying to say something. It's the urgency to communicate... the same urgency that musicians have or poets. You know, there's something that they need to say, and they say it the way they say it. And graffiti was just the perfect vehicle. Today, it's still the same urgency of communication. You know, you wanna say something whether it's something that's political or not, if it's something personal or not. The Bronx flows through you, man. I don't care where you go. Someone asked me, "Yo, Crash, where you from?" I don't say New York. I say the Bronx. - Hi. - Hey. How you doing? - I'm good. How are you? How have I been? Everything just sucks, basically. We're being evicted today. We found out we were being evicted on Tuesday, and the marshal's suppose to come today. I've told Estefany about what's happening 'cause she doesn't make me feel like I have to have some sort of solution. She just lets me vent. So basically just what we've been doing is, is packing. Do you have any idea where you're gonna be? I have no idea, and Richeal's supposed to have her party on Saturday... - Yeah. - And I don't even think I can go 'cause by that time, we're probably gonna be finding some, like shelter, stuff like that. The first time we were evicted was when I was in fourth grade. So that was eight years ago. And then we were evicted again five years ago. When it happened in middle school to me, I didn't talk to anyone about it. Like, I was just literally going through the motions on my own. No one knew until after the fact. Yeah. I never realized how much easier it is to go through these kinda situations once you're able to speak to somebody and be like, you know, "This is happening to me. I really don't know what I'm doing right now." ♪ Ooh, child ♪ ♪ Things are gonna get easier ♪ Today I was supposed to be at graduation rehearsal, which is something I've been looking forward to for a while now. I'm supposed to be there decorating my cap. For me to say that I can't be there and have to explain why I can't be there is hard for me 'cause it kinda makes me feel like I'm being weak. ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ We'll get it together and we'll get it all done ♪ My gown is here and the little thing they gave me that says "president" on it that I was supposed to wear it with my gown. I'm very much proud of her right about now. There's no word to tell you how much. She's the first one heading to college, so that make me very proud... very, very proud. Now I realize how much of a role I play in my household. So it's like, what's gonna happen when I'm gone? Everyone has a goal of being rich or living in a nice house, but my definition of making it would be, when I'll be able to have a place of my own or at least somewhere I could help my mom. And I did tell my mom if she doesn't want me to worry when I'm away, I need her to call me. But if not, 'cause you're still in the city, I would like you to check up on my mom. - I got you. I can do that. ♪ And the world is much brighter ♪ The last stop on our tour of the old neighborhood was maybe the most important to me. DeWitt Clinton High School. - How are you, Georgie boy? - Good to see you. I just saw you yesterday. Carl and I met up with another one of our close friends from the neighborhood. - Jay. - Jay Schwartz, New York. Jay Schwartz, New York. - Jay. - Jay. Jay Schwartz, New York... the best athlete of the group. It's nice to visit the Bronx, but it's not the same. Oh, my God. What happened to our school? - Yeah, no kidding. This gorgeous school. - Are you kidding? It's not the same. We came to the school with the memories of this incredible, the most beautiful school any of us have ever seen. And now it's all covered up. Am I good to go? Okay, thank you. Do all the students go through the metal detectors? Unbelievable. Of course we're very shocked that... That they have to have security, but it goes on in all schools today, and in all, you know, public places, and this is the era we live in. We look at it and say it's very strange that you have to go through security to get into a school. We never had that. We never had that. But we had teachers that used to hit us. I'll tell you that. They don't do that anymore. So the times have changed. My name is Danielle Hazart. - What's your name? - Danielle. - Danielle. - Yes. And you're a girl at DeWitt Clinton. 'Cause you know, we suffered. We didn't have girls. You are so lucky. What's your name? - My name is Javid. Javid. Danielle and Javid were very intelligent. You know, I thought they were both smarter than me. Danielle is the class president, so she's definitely smarter than me. This is Carl. - Hi. What's your name? - Javid. I'm a big fan of avoiding my own problems until they go away. So I do extra stuff in school to avoid dealing with my circumstances. I distract myself from what was happening. - How old are you? - 17. Well, we were 17 here also. Yeah, 14 to 18. It was cool having to show them around, how Clinton has changed. They remembered the good old days when there was no girls here. And they really, really hated having no girls here apparently. Yep, see, this looks identical. Walking around the Bronx Boys in my school, which is their school too, it was really eye-opening. What was the building like when you guys were coming to school here? This was a gorgeous-looking school. - Yeah. - This school was one of the prettiest high schools in the city. Now it's all boarded up. What are they doing out there? They're fixing the exterior of the building because... - Are they changing it? - No. They're just, like, re... they're just fixing it. - Cleaning it. - Yeah, basically. It was very heartwarming that they had a sincere interest in our looking at the high school and getting to enjoy it again. - Let me ask you something. What is the school song now? - Okay, it's, um... okay. - All right. One, two, three. ♪ DeWitt, C-L-I-N-T-O-N, boom ♪ ♪ Clinton, oh, Clinton ♪ ♪ Ever to thee ♪ ♪ Fairest of high schools ♪ ♪ Give them three times three ♪ ♪ Oh, students, long may we cherish thee ♪ ♪ Faithful we'll be ♪ ♪ Clinton, oh, Clinton ♪ ♪ For you and me ♪ - Brava! Brava! Bravo! George had a lot more energy than I did. George just was, like, running around. He's like, "Oh, this elevator's taking too long. Let's just walk down the stairs." So I felt like that's something that he's probably had, that characteristic, since he was my age. I was learning tap dancing, and the guys made fun of me. They said, "George Shapiro's a sissy tap dancer." So I gave up tap dancing. I regret it to this day. I would've been great. I would've been a great tap dancer. It was great to see how happy they were. 'Cause sometimes people say old age is just sad, decrepit, and kind of, like, walking around slow. These guys had life to them. When I was here, they used to have a place where they put the names of the kids when they graduated from a certain year. My God. This... I'm on this board. Where's '49? - Right here. - 1949. All right, let me see. - Barish, I knew. - Davis... Here I am. There I am. I have to take a picture of this thing. Every day for the past four years, I walk in the hallways on the first floor and I see these names of, like, these ancient people and I don't know any of them. Carl Golub is here 'cause he was smart. You had to be over 90 average to get on here. I wasn't that smart. - Neither was I. I wasn't that smart. Don't you remember these names? Kugelmass? - Yeah, Kugelmass. Oh, yeah, of course. - How about... To actually see them and, like, see them point at names that they know or their own names was, like, "Wow, that's really cool." And the fact that, like, you know, they're still around to be able to do that was so cool. This is the first time you've seen that? - First time I've seen it. - That's unbelievable. I kept trying to picture them in my hallways... I call them my hallways 'cause I'm so used to the school. I kind of have to keep reminding myself the way I see them are completely different than how they used to see them when they were here. After that, the kids took us to the library and introduced us to some of the other students. We sat down and they told us about their experience of growing up in the Bronx. Um, I come from an immigrant family. - What's your heritage? - I'm Hondurian. Right. Um, and as the oldest sibling, I'm expected to go to college and work to help sustain the family. And I'm so motivated to do it... it's because I have a younger sister, and I know if I work hard, I don't have to give her that experience in her life. - Right. Beautiful. I knew all my friends come from different backgrounds and different struggles, but I never knew in detail. I have family that don't live in the U.S., so we send over, like, food, supplies. Where do they live? They live in the Caribbean islands, and so my mom sends them food, supplies, and stuff, but everyone relies on her a lot. And it's just my mom at home. The fact that they all came from immigrant families was extremely impressive. - My dad works two jobs. My mom holds down a job herself. They work day and night. They're always tired when they come home, so it's kinda hard for them, and so I kinda see myself as a gateway to end the cycle. I love that they weren't judgmental, 'cause, like, we don't know them really. And we gave them kinda, like, our life story in a way in a short amount of time and our backgrounds and all that. It's just me and my two younger brothers, so I kind of take on, like, a parent role in my house too. My mom would be fixing, like, jewelry pieces for 10¢ apiece. My dad came from El Salvador, which, at the time, was, like, engulfed in, like, a really bloody civil war. My biggest hope is that through my studies and through my professional career, I can make enough, you know, to provide for them for the rest of their lives. It's incredible that they could stay positive with all the adversity that they've been going through in their homes. Just to know that I'm going to be going somewhere that I really wanna be is just my way of showing my mom how thankful I am for everything she's done for me. When I went to DeWitt Clinton, I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do later in life. You all seem to know exactly what you wanna do. I think it's fabulous. - Let me tell you something. I'm a first generation. Our parents came from Russia and Poland. My father and mother had very little money. My mother and father went to third grade, then they had to stop going to school and had to go to work. So what you see here is the culmination of experiences that they went through similar to what you're talking about. Some people gonna hate what we said and be like, "Oh, you don't have a father. I can't believe that," or, "You come from this place. I can't believe that. I don't wanna hear you." But they were like, "Oh, we understand. "Our parents were immigrants. We struggled. "We understand what you're talking about, and we persevered and we had successes throughout our life." To get to hear the Bronx Boys say, you know, "Life wasn't easy for us either. We pretty much came from a similar struggle," it kind of gave me a lighter insight, or a lighter, like, outlook on what my future will be like. - You all have great ideas. Stick with it. Don't let anybody talk you out of it. Anybody. And especially, don't talk yourself out of it. I felt kinda inspired by them. They were like, "Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it. "Don't believe in your mind that you can't do it. "Go out and do what you have to do to become who you wanna become." Let me tell you something about old friends. You're never gonna find friends in your life... and I don't like preaching, but I'm preaching... You're never gonna find friends in your life again as your friends that you meet when you're young. You're gonna meet people you like, but if they move, you don't care. But when something happens to one of these guys, I care a lot. Why after so many years do I care for them? It's the friendship that we've developed from 4 1/2 years of age until we got out of high school. Well said. It's easier to give your wisdom to strangers than it is to people who you know well. People you know well don't take your advice very often. But what Carl said is so valid 'cause, you know, there's times that you're really down and you have a friend that you care about. It elevates you and gets you through the roughest of times. One of my best friends, Howard West... he lost his job. I got him a job. We followed each other. We connected with each other, and it's so important because you have all these additional hearts in your favor when you have that kind of a bond or friendships. And that's really important because you never know how you're gonna connect and how you can recommend someone and change their lives with one job and one opportunity. Howard West, his partner, said something a number of years ago that stuck with me 'cause I thought he said something that really made a lot of sense. He said, "Life is not fair. Get over it." - Yeah. - And that... think about that. It's not fair. Get over it. - That's right. - Move on. You get over that and then, you know, you keep your great friends and just motivate yourself. You lit up my life 'cause you guys... You have such a great essence and great ambitions. And it's just very special. And that's what counts much more than the building, actually. High school's about family. It's about the people you meet, the connections you make, and going forward in life, how you keep those connections strong. Those guys have been friends since they were four years old. They crack jokes on each other all the time. They tell stories. They have, like, a genuine love around them, and you can tell that they have love around them. - That's me. George Shapiro. I was called Speedy 'cause I was so fast. Speedy. When... I was French club, see? And honor school. I didn't remember that. We gained a lot going in there, and I don't think we anticipated that. I really thought we were gonna give them a lot. But we didn't think that we would get a lot from them. The thing I really got is that the future for this country's good. The people that are replacing us may sound different, they may look different. they may think a little differently, but the future's very, very good. How much they stressed on how their friendship has kept them going to be where they are now, it made me feel a lot better... or at least more comfortable with how things are gonna lead up in the future. ♪ Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Things are gonna get brighter ♪ ♪ Ooh, child ♪ ♪ Things are gonna get easier ♪ ♪ Ooh, things are gonna get brighter ♪ ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ We'll get it together and we'll get it all done ♪ ♪ Someday, when your head is much lighter ♪ ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ We'll walk in the rays in the beautiful sun ♪ ♪ Someday, when the world is much brighter ♪ ♪ Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier ♪ ♪ Oh, child, things will get brighter ♪ ♪ Ooh, child ♪ ♪ Things are gonna get easier ♪ ♪ Oh, things will get brighter ♪ ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ We'll get it together and we'll get it all done ♪ Um, what I wanted to do first was, this is my way of taking my hat off to all the seniors here, 'cause we finally made it. It has not been easy. It's not gonna get any easier, but we've all made it here. Making it to this point was a struggle after the year we've had, and, boy, what a year we've had. There's been so many changes. There were changes that we embraced with full arms this year. Thank God prom wasn't in the cafeteria. And look around you. We're outside. There were also changes we did not enjoy so much, changes within ourselves, changes in our friendships, even changes we had to do with our school. But as DeWitt Clinton's High School Class of 2017 seniors, We looked at these changes and just kept it pushing. It was not pleasant and it was not wanted, but we as a class pushed through the hardships of this year together. ♪ Ooh, child ♪ With each change comes a difficulty with adjustment, and sometimes, that's incredibly hard. ♪ Oh, things are gonna get easier ♪ As we move on into the next stage of our lives, we will be thrown changes we won't agree with and won't particularly like. And it will, to be put simply, suck. ♪ Oh ♪ However, recently, I was told something that I would love to share with all of you today. And it's that life isn't fair. Get over it. ♪ Oh ♪ But I encourage the graduates today to keep it pushing like we did this year. So if your form of pushing is crying and then getting back to work, push. If it's making a joke about a stressful situation that you shouldn't really be joking about, push. If your form of pushing is focusing on what needs to be done, push. In the end, when we get there, we'll all see that life doesn't need to be fair to make us strong. And I can definitely say looking at every single one of you today Clinton's class of 2017 is very strong. I am proud of all of us today for pushing our way to where we belong. And we can hold these up in the air and say this is ours. Congratulations.
