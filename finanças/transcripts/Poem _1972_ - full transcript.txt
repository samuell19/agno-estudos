Don't you want to see your mother? Today isn't Sunday. It's okay - he's on holiday. I'm off on Sundays. If it's Sunday, I'll accompany him. Can't you take a break yourself? Your mother will be glad to see you. I told her I'd only go back during the Bon Festival and on New Year's Day. I don't care any more. If you aren't coming, tell him so yourself. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Here he comes. Okay. Let's go now. I'm not going. Please remember me to my mother. What's wrong? Why won't you come with us? Because I have my work. What are you saying? Didn't I say I'd give everyone a day off? I'm not very keen on having a day off. Don't mind me. Please go. I can hear... It's the sound of the mountains. It's the wind whistling through the treetops. Natsuko, we're going to see my parents. Why don't you put on a pleasant face? I'll go to the library. All right. I hope you'll study hard and pass the bar examination next time. - Is that sarcasm? - No. I sincerely hope you will. I see. I thought we would be alone. Don't worry. This is also exciting. Will a pillow do? From here onwards, all the forests belong to the Moriyamas. Marry me. - What? - Marry me. Marry you? If I pass the exam, it will be alright. But if not, I'll be an eternal law firm assistant. Or a scrivener. Is that okay with you? No, it isn't. Pass the exam. If I want to run away from you, I'll only have to keep failing. If the master discovers our relationship, will he get angry? The madam will, rather than him. Why? I think she's sexually frustrated. A woman can tell. Hmm... Is she? No, no. She isn't a woman you could seduce. Don't have silly ideas. He's like a clock. Ihei Moriyama I heard our ancestors had that rock brought here... in the Age of Provincial Wars, but it's ruined now. Welcome, young master. Thank you for taking care of my son. I wanted to bring Jun with us, but he said he'd only come back... during the Bon Festival and on New Year's Day. I see. That's fine, if he's doing well. Is he helpful in any way? Yes, very helpful. A young man like him is rare nowadays. But he won't eat any meat. He only has miso soup and pickles. And for snacks, what do you call it again? It's Hattaiko, roasted wheat powder. Yes, that's it. Always that. He doesn't have any cakes. He's all right that way. Are you staying over? We'd like to, but there's a trial tomorrow. - Please don't bother yourselves. - All right. We've come just to see my father. I can take some Hattaiko to him if you like, Hama? Yes, thank you very much. Father. I've always wanted to ask you... Jun is the child of Hama... and whom? Sorry to have kept you waiting. - You! - What? You didn't tell your father about rebuilding today, either. It's not good to get on his wrong side over such things. You may get on his wrong side, but you have to tell him some day. Don't talk about that any more. We've been quarrelling on the way. I'm tired. Daddy! What will you do with that? I'm going to make this a model for calligraphy. I see. But if you need a model, you could use outstanding works of calligraphy? That's not very good handwriting. I don't mind. Because these characters refer to those who already left this world. In the stones on which they are inscribed is the Absolute. The Absolute by the name of Death. When I see them in this way, the epitaphs have a special flavour. There's nothing in the stones. What is in them is just darkness. It's a stupid idea that if you build graves, the memories of the dead will remain in this world forever. The spirit of a dead person will have disappeared in a hundred years. Some spirits last for about 1,400 years, at the longest. But they are a little too regretful. They say Buddha's spirit disappeared right after his death. - Drink this. - Yes. I'll get the door. It may not be very reasonable... to add another lawyer only four days before the trial. But to be frank, I don't find Arita very reliable. - I've chosen the wrong person. - But he's a shrewd lawyer. - Everyone says that. - Once in court, he does the job. Like doctors, lawyers must have charm that... can capture lay people's hearts. They must inspire a deep sense of trust. - Yes, that's true. - But Arita doesn't. He has no interest in alcohol, golf or women. Women don't matter, though. He never keeps me company. - He has antipathy towards the rich. - No, he doesn't. - I'm sure he does. I heard you're the eldest son of Ihei Moriyama in Sasayama. Yes, I am. Would you like some? I heard you're capable. Well, I wonder about that... Could you study it quickly? I've already told Arita. I don't like men like him. I don't like such arrogant clients, either. He takes lawyers for servants or something. So do you have any objection to me being a co-counsel? No, I don't. Only, I'm still studying these documents. What should we do? I'll have them copied. Half a day should be enough. I'll be able to give them back to you by the end of tomorrow. Wada. Have Jun copy these. All right. It's been ages since I dealt with such a big case. I'll do my best. Welcome back. - What's that? - Her partner seems to be Wada. What? If the rumour spreads, I'll be a laughing stock. Did you warn them? No. It will be awkward if it's just my imagination. That's right... Well... I'll have to stay up all night. I'd better take a nap now. What are you doing? I'll do it! Master. Yes. What's wrong? Why do you have to finish your work at 5 on the dot, sticking to the rules? Can't you see it's urgent work we must do quickly? I would rather not work after 5 o'clock. This isn't a big company, and two of us aren't trade union members, either. Don't be silly. I don't work after 5 o'clock. You do it. Get it done by the end of tonight. All right. Don't argue! - Huh? - Huh? Yes. Hey, do you have anything against me? No. So, why won't you work? I work from 9 in the morning until 5. I get up in the middle of the night and patrol everywhere in the house. I've been doing it in this way for a year. I would rather not work after 5 o'clock. Why do you patrol the house at night? My mother told me to protect this house of the Moriyamas' well. That's why I'll be responsible if a fire should occur. Okay, I see. The master is asking for your help. I would rather not enter the office after 5 o'clock. He's asking for your help. I can't, after 5 o'clock. You're insistent. It's you who are insistent. No. He says he'd rather not enter this room after 5 o'clock. I see. I serve the Moriyamas. The case has nothing to do with me. That's precisely the point. Listen. In this situation, if you copy the documents, that will mean you serve the Moriyamas. I'm not responsible for a case you accepted at short notice. It's ironic. Do you have anything against Wada? What do you mean? Is the relationship between him and Fujino unpleasant to you, for instance? Is there anything between them? No. No, nothing at all. It's okay, then. By the way, is Hattaiko so delicious? Why not have rare beef steaks sometimes? The taste of grain is best to me. Ow! You're slow, Wada. We have so many to copy. Hurry up. Why did that come out there? You put it in here. Why did it come out there? If put in here, it should come out there, right? Oh, Wada, this is no good. Please, Wada. Oh, it's coming out there! Wada is a clod. Utterly useless. Natsuko, give us a hand. Natsuko. Hey. Without you, we can't get finished by tomorrow morning. I don't want to ask Arita to wait... some more time. Natsuko, please. Please. You're slow. I heard you won the case. Wada, your master is a great lawyer. I won it! I won it! - Congratulations. - It went well, despite the short study time. I'll hire all the geishas tonight. We must raise toasts. Don't make loud noises. Don't worry. The master got drunk and is already asleep. We won it. Hurray! Mr Kogure... Mr Kogure gave me 100,000 yen. Don't be happy with such a small amount. This autumn, do not fail the bar exam again. I know. Have confidence in me! Come here once more. They both have nothing to do with the Moriyamas. Excuse me. You're discreet. You've been aware of their relationship, haven't you? Yes. You kept it to yourself well. Don't you envy them? If you refuse me, I may have a lover outside. I'm afraid. If you do that outside, everyone will talk about the Moriyamas. That's right. That's why... What's the matter? Stupid. Nothing. I hadn't noticed. The madam's having an affair with Jun. Are you sure? I saw them together. What's wrong? Enough. It's hot. Why, suddenly? It's too late to run away. You can never run away from me. Good morning. Good morning. Jun, you're wearing a new shirt. Is that part of your work? Today is the Bon Festival. You promised to let me go back during the Bon and on New Year's Day, so I'm going back to Sasayama. I'll be back early tomorrow morning. Oh, I'm sorry. Natsuko, can you give him a ride and visit my ancestors' grave for me? I don't mind driving him there, but I feel reluctant to see your parents alone. You only have to give him a lift, then. I have an appointment with Mr Kogure, so I can't afford to visit the grave. It's the Bon today? I thought it was way past. In Sasayama, it's the Bon of the lunar calendar, isn't it? - Please. - Thank you. Do you have a minute, Mr Moriyama? Excuse me for a moment. Thank you for that time. Fortunately, it was just me who saw it. Did your wife drive towards Sasayama today? Yes. How did you know that? With a young man? Yes, a very young man. I don't know if I should inform you, but they went into a motel. What? Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I see. Madam, Jun has come back to visit the Moriyamas' family grave. I'm back now. Welcome back. How are Yasushi and his wife doing? They're well. You're hungry, aren't you? Do you want some? No, thank you. I'll go to the grave first. Excuse me. We owe everything to the Moriyamas. Be sure to do good work over there. Don't worry. I work hard. Pierre Klossowski Living Currency I'm late. I saw your parents, after all. I heard about it from Arita... Jun is a tool. That's all. I don't care about that. I don't mind whatever you do with anyone. Only, never do things that could end up on everyone's tongues. Why was it Arita, of all men? Master. Your brother's here. Okay. Toru's here! - Toru. - Hey. You haven't written to me in two years. No news is good news. And this isn't news, either. - You have legs? - Yes. You even deal with rape cases. I'll stay at this house for a while. Okay. But why not go back to Sasayama once? No. There's no point in seeing parents. - I'll just wait for them to die. - You haven't changed. - Is there a room for me? - Yes. - But I'll have one made up over there soon. - Thanks. That's my brother! You can count on me. Hi Toru. It's been a long time. I'm sorry for my long silence. You've become even more beautiful. What about a baby? Not yet. Women who have no children are the best. You're lucky, brother. Of course, I don't want any, either. So, is the Moriyama line going to end with our generation? You haven't changed one bit. Thank you. Have you returned with a view to living in the Tamba mountains? What do you mean? Such countryside after living in Tokyo? Aren't Kyoto or Kobe better? I don't want to live in cities any more. Brother, these mountain forests of Tamba are our property. Let's build a golf course or a dreamland some day... and lead a life of ease in the future. Hey, who's that girl? Well... Shall we hand over this house to Toru... and live in Kyoto for a while? We must use up all the Moriyamas' property within a couple of decades. It will be hard. It will be a massive undertaking. I wish I had 10 or 20 more lives. Natsuko, given my law office, shall we move to Kyoto, handing over the house to this rogue? I'm bored with this house. I want to return to Kyoto. Right, we'll leave here and move to Kyoto. - Natsuko. - Yes? We'll move to Kyoto. Moriyama Law Firm Have you decided where to go? For half an assistant like me, there's no place to go. Don't be cynical. Why don't you remain here, then? I'll have nothing to do with that playboy-like man. My goal is to be a lawyer. I hope you'll become one soon. Stupid. Don't be so sarcastic. But you have no jobs any more, either. No copying any more. Nothing. I don't mind, because my new master is also a Moriyama. My job is to serve the Moriyamas. What do you intend to be in the future? As I said, I serve the Moriyamas... "Leave here", at such short notice? You can't stay here any more. Where and how will you study law? We couldn't follow them to their flat in Kyoto... I have no good ideas. 2 million. With this money, you could start a small judicial scriveners office. We'll never speak to anyone about it. Do you need a note? Even if I have a note, it will be over once you talk. It would be pointless to accuse you after it's known to the public. I don't need such a thing. Can you leave as soon as possible? And whenever we run into each other, let's not speak to each other. Or we'll only get uncomfortable. Thank you for everything. I'll sit the exam to be a judicial scrivener. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's too much of a bother to do anything. I'm going to idle away my time for a while, seeing how things will go. Idleness is the best virtue in life. He should quit his lawyer's job, too. Yes, you're right. I don't know if it's true, but basically lawyers are supposed to have morals - a sense of social justice. However, only the poor can be such persons. We're not poor. My brother has chosen the wrong profession. He's stupid. Do you need something? - Can you grate some narcissus roots for a cold compress for feet? - All right. Hama. Yes. Hama, did you tell Jun about his real father? You'll have nothing to worry about if something happens to me. I've arranged for one third of the Moriyamas' property... to go to him without fail. Your son cares for the Moriyamas more than my sons do. I didn't expect this to happen. It makes no difference whether it's divided into two or three. Dividing it means... the end of the Moriyamas. I don't want to end up as a country scrivener like this. Then you should study hard. The bar exam is approaching. I'm not confident. I fail the exams again and again. I must do my best. Don't complain. Even though just a scrivener, you got 2 million thanks to me. Why have I become like this? Ouch! Look, here he comes. - It's been a long time. - No need for greetings. - You can handle documents, as you were my brother's assistant, right? - Yes. Fill in the mortgage application form, using this. Is this a copy of the Moriyamas' deeds? Yes. - Are you going to borrow money? - Shut up! - Just prepare the documents quietly. - Yes. Do it right away. I've already arranged with the bank. All right. Bring them to the back door of the Towa Bank at 3 o'clock. Pay for this. Yes. Huh? With a man like that, the Moriyamas are doomed. That's none of our business. 1,620 square metres... They'll lend 10 million yen, at least. How about demanding hush money again? No, he won't be upset by that. I heard he brings many women home every day and night. He's a sex maniac. Have you saved up a lot of money? No, not at all. It's the age of instant foods. It's tough for stands. Do you take 10,000 yen a night? Even when it sells very well, I don't reach that. Will you come to my house now? I'll pay you a generous reward. Huh? We'll drink, eat and have fun. I'll give you 100,000. 100,000? Hey, what's wrong? Well... I don't get very enthusiastic... Okay, I'll give you another 100,000. Hang in there, thinking of Prince Shotoku's face. Let's keep going. This will make 200,000. Master, someone is there. What? Bugger it, that bastard again! How many times do I have to tell you to stop these futile night patrols? I'll never stop them. It will be serious, if a fire occurs. It doesn't matter if such a house burns down. It now belongs to other people - it's security on a loan. This house was built with the best Japanese cypresses in Sasayama. I protect it. - Hey, houseboy. - Yes. I'll show you something good. Follow me. What's that? An image of sexual intercourse. Join them and have a threesome. Come! I haven't finished the round yet. Just come! It's my order! No, I won't. Can't you obey your master, you bastard? Damn it. Can't you obey your master, you houseboy? Do what I tell you to do. Get out of here. Get out of here. No, I won't. I must stay here. Okay, I'll let you, then. Thank you very much. But you must accept one condition. Yes. If that's within my power... You don't need any power for this. Anyone can do it. Eat nothing from tomorrow on. You should be able to do it. All right. If you break this condition, you'll have to leave here. Toru Moriyama What you're telling me isn't true. I have no money. Even if I had some, I wouldn't give you any. Don't you care if the rumour spreads? No. Honour isn't important to the Moriyamas, is it? Goodbye. Hey, wait. Stay and have fun. Keep me company. Nonsense. No. If you leave, I'll have to call the police, because of blackmail. Absurd. You squeezed money out of my brother, huh? I don't know. You liar. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me. You got a taste of success. One villain can easily tell what another is thinking. What are you doing? No. Hold it. No. Ouch! Damn it. No. You're just a maid. Don't put on airs! Damn it. Forgive me. Stop it. Forgive me. You promised not to see me again. You must have nothing to do with us. I've come on an errand for your brother. For Toru? Stupid. Could you come quickly? Jun is dying. Your brother told him not to eat, and Jun actually eats nothing. You're a clod. - Jun? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, really. - Come! - Yes. Hey, Jun. I take it back. I take back my orders. Eat something. Please eat something. I'm saying I take it back. You can't erase the words you once said, unless you go back in time. Ah, brother. Jun, what's wrong? You've done enough. We understand you well. I've got it. Natsuko has broken your heart? That's why you won't eat anything. That prostitute. Prostitute? Huh? My sister-in-law? That's funny! But Jun, women are essentially prostitutes. You can do nothing about it. Indeed. I think it's best to ask father to divide the property - this house is already mortgaged. Right. If my father-in-law sells the forests in Sasayama, we won't have to be bound to this land any more. Yes. If I do it, there will be no chance. But if the eldest son brings it up, father will probably say yes. Well... He's always like this. He's indecisive. What's wrong? Please never do that. Please don't sell the mountains. Are you ordering us? Ordering? I'm asking you. Shut up, houseboy! Bastard. Die quickly. With so little fat, you should burn well, making crackling noises. Jun, why do you care for the Moriyamas so much? It's not just our forests that will be sold and divided into pieces. It's the same everywhere, across the country. Are you all right? That's why... I'm asking you. Only the Moriyamas must never be divided into pieces. The land of the Moriyamas... must be the last fortress. What is that for? There's nothing worth protecting in Japan any more, I think. You're right. That's exactly why it's necessary. If, even devoid of its content, there's a form left, the content and life will definitely come back one day. For that form, the nature of the Moriyamas - the old mountains - is necessary. If we lose them, we'll lose the form that our souls rely on. We don't need souls, Jun. Japan already perished. It's too late. Europe and America, as well as Japan, already perished. In short, the world doesn't exist. The world itself, or existence itself, is but a dream. It's just a fancy of the inorganic substances constituting the universe. Hey, houseboy. When the forests are sold, we'll give you some money. Then, you'll be able to stuff yourself with Hattaiko. If you have those thoughts, why don't you... kill yourself? Because... killing oneself is also nothing more than a dream. This may be the first and last time we see our mountains. Jun, you know these mountains best. Guide us. I wonder what price estate agents will quote for these mountains? Look at these Japanese cedars! Just for those, we'll certainly get hundreds of millions each. It will be ten times that. Don't you think? The sun rises from the Moriyamas' forests and sets in them. You put it nicely. But that's all going to be over. We're no longer in such an age. Hey, stand up. Hey, Jun, what's wrong? Is your end near? Not bad. This is an excellent place for that. A graveyard for elephants, so to speak. This is interesting. Where did you get it? What might that be? It's probably a jack-o'-lantern. This is interesting. Translated by quaisnord Proofreading by lordretsudo
