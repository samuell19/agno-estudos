NETFLIX PRESENTS Good afternoon, everyone. Raquel, read us your story. I didn't write anything. It's useless to sign up for a writing workshop if you don't write. She's actually hiding it. It's right there. What's that? - What's what? - That paper. - No, it's nothing. - Yeah, it is. I said it's nothing! Does anyone here want to share? To tell a story it's not enough just to know how to write. You also need to be brave enough to tell it. And that's why my story doesn't start here. I guess this story should start with my house. MY HOUSE A humble abode that through ups and downs ended up surrounded by an empire. HIDALGO MANSION The Hidalgo mansion. Even though they're my next-door neighbors, the Hidalgo's world is completely different from mine. The Hidalgos own Alpha 3, one of the most influential companies in the country, whose headquarters is the tallest, shiniest, most spectacular building in Barcelona. Alpha 3 refers to the three heirs to the empire, the Hidalgo brothers. Artemis Hidalgo, the oldest. Apolo Hidalgo, the youngest. And my favorite, a Greek god fallen down to Earth, Ares Hidalgo. The most enigmatic, the most inscrutable, and sexiest of the trio of gods. You could say I have an unhealthy obsession with Ares. My computer's hard drive can attest to that. I mean, in Olympus, they know how to make good stuff. Too good to look the other way. I've never said a word to Ares. He's never noticed me. But I know everything he does, when he trains, where he goes... I've kind of collected a little info on him. Alright, a ton. Lots and lots of information. Or at least I did until that thing with my Wi-Fi happened. UNSTABLE CONNECTION Apparently, my router decided to plot against me. An evil plan that was about to teach me that my bulletproof password wasn't as bulletproof as I thought and that my broadband connection would launch me further than I had ever imagined. Hi there. Thanks for sharing your Wi-Fi password. We don't get signal inside, but it's great out here. I'm Apolo. My brother Ares said you gave him the Wi-Fi password. Excuse me? So... Well, see you later then. As wild as it sounds, it all began with the Wi-Fi password. 4R35 GR33K G0D Are you using my Wi-Fi? Yeah. Without my permission. Well, mine's not working, so now I'm using yours. - You admit it, just like that. - Honesty's one of my qualities. You're such an ass. You know me pretty well, right? But I also know stuff about you that I'm not supposed to, Raquel. Stop using my Wi-Fi and turn down the music. Or what? I'll keep using your Wi-Fi, and you can't do anything to stop me. Sleep tight, witch. Witch? You've messed with the wrong neighbor. Looks like you've decided to never make friends ever again in your life. This way, we're not going to have to invite a bunch of people to our wedding. So, what? You're going to wear that to prom too? If there's a swim class, I probably will. I don't think the PTA would approve of a teacher-student relationship. What relationship, Yoshi? - And Javi? - Poor Javi, he's a shit kisser, man. That's logical. Yoshi, shut it. See you two later. Stop drooling. Stop the bullshit, Yoshi. Just tell her you're crazy about her. That way, you'll end your misery, please. Easy. - Let's go. - Let's go, come on. Come on, let's go! Come on, mate. Get up. It's freezing. Ares, where are you going? You're not going home. Have a drink. I can't today. - You're walking in this rain? - Come on. We'll give you a ride. - Ares, get in the car. - See you tomorrow. Yeah, let's go! - That was a nice punch. - What are you doing? Smoking in a quiet place. What are you doing here? Nothing. Why'd you follow me, Raquel? I can walk wherever I want to. Right... and can you tell me why you would want to walk behind me? I'm not walking right behind you. You think I don't know about your little obsession with me? I don't know what you mean. "Four, R, 35..." And I think it was something like this, and finally... It's code, right? Your Wi-Fi password. Funny how it almost looks like, "Ares, Greek god." - The world doesn't revolve around you. - Maybe not the world. But you. To steal your Wi-Fi, I hacked your computer. Found a lot of stuff in there. Searches, photos... texts. You know hacking is considered a crime, don't you? Even if you write about me? What did you read? Why do you write about me, Raquel? You don't know? I do it because I like you. I assumed you were just another quiet, introverted girl. - Maybe you're more than that. - More than that? I'm the most interesting girl you'll meet in your entire life. What does this interesting girl want from me? - Can't you figure it out? - Want to come see my room, that it? And wake up with no dignity? No, thank you. What do you want, then? For you to fall for me. Is that why you're here? Seriously, you're not even my type. We'll see about that. I'm here because I'm afraid to walk home alone. Come on, walk with me, Ares. If you want, I'll walk you home. But it comes with a price. Price? You have to let me kiss you wherever I want. That price is a bit high, don't you think? Well, enjoy your walk in the dark. Go on. Okay, fine. Let's go. MANUEL HIDALGO 1936-2019 Thanks for the Wi-Fi, witch. My Wi-Fi, my rules, man. You're so ugly, you'll break your phone. So handsome. Yeah, you're right. MOM YOUR SOUP'S GOING TO GET COLD. What? The soup. It'll do you good after all that rain. - The neighbor seems very cute. - Mom. You could have invited him in for dinner. No, mom, we just ran into each other. He's not my friend or anything. He's our neighbor. He's a Hidalgo. He is a Hidalgo. So? We're not very much alike, okay? What? You're not even a teeny bit funny, you know? You look so pretty when you get all defensive. I hate you. Show yourself or I'll hit you. What are you doing? Reconnecting the Wi-Fi. Somebody unplugged it. May I ask why you think you're the owner of my internet connection? What is this? The Temple. I could sue you for breaking in to my house. I know that. But you're not going to. How can you be so sure of that? I guess it's not common for stalkers to report the people they stalk. Huh? It's the other way around. Breaking into my room through the window could also be considered stalking. Yeah, it's not the same. Why not? Because I know you like me. But I don't like you. What are you doing? Do you trust me? Should I go on? Yeah. By the way, you should clean your room more often. It's not that hard. I study all week and work on the weekends. Unlike other people. Where do you work? My work is super interesting. - I'll leave you to your reading, witch. - Stop calling me that. Fix your hair once in a while, and I'll quit. Hey. I've got the sushi you ordered. - I didn't order anything. - Sure it wasn't you, sir? You must be wrong, kid. If you want, we can check the order on my app. Here's the order placed for Valle del Tenas High School. Do you have a day shift colleague? Sometimes we get the address from an old purchase. Can you please call them? This is getting cold. Paco, did you order takeout today? POOL No, there's some kid here who... Gotcha, man. - No. - No? Well, here. On the house. Have a good one, sir. VALLE DEL TENAS HIGH SCHOOL - Guess where we can go. - Where? Not again. Really? - I'm sick of you. - Give me a minute. No. We're busy as hell. Buy or bounce, okay Yoshi? Coming, Carla! I want a cone ma'am, please. You're so cheap, Yoshi. Isn't that your neighbor? Interesting indeed. I know you're down there, witch. I was just picking up some stuff. Are we going to talk or are you going to keep hiding? This is Yoshi, my best friend. Well, best friend and future husband. My brother's opening a club, and tonight is the opening. I wanted to invite you. As compensation for the Wi-Fi. You'll be on the list. The plus one's your choice. I pictured him a little taller and actually a bit nicer too. Do you want to come to the party, Yoshi? You're going? Wow. Check out all these gorgeous people. I'm digging this new Raquel who goes to parties and rubs elbows with the elite. I was born to be rich but something went wrong. - I'm so thirsty. Should I get you a drink? - Yeah, please do. I'll get you a cocktail! Only VIP. Can't I just get in? A friend of mine is in there and he asked me to come in. You expect me to buy that? Oh wow, it's the Wi-Fi girl. Hey, please open the door. Incorrect password. I need to get in. She's a special guest. If she was special, I would know her. And I don't know who she is, or you. Really? You don't know who I am? Excuse me. He's my little brother. - Don't let him in. - Artemis, come on! Are you hiding from me? - I didn't even know you were here. - You looked like you were running away. In order to run away I would have to be afraid of you. You should be afraid of me. Really? Maybe. Am I in any danger? All that information you have about me, and you're still surprised. What are you doing, witch? I told you not to call me that. Karma is a bitch, Greek god. Still water, please. Are you okay? You look all sweaty. It's hot in here, you know? I already told Artemis to turn up the AC, but he won't listen. Typical brother stuff. He won't let anyone give me booze. Don't you think that's wrong? Give me a vodka soda, please. - He's not allowed to drink. - It's for a friend. - So, what's her name? - Daniela. Don't tell your brother, okay? Relax. I know the drill. You're not gonna believe me. I think the club is getting smaller and... I didn't come out with you just to babysit this kid. But at least we made it out without anyone seeing him. - The club is very tiny. - Just sit down, will you, kid? And shut up. Are you an angel? We're going home, sweetie. - Are we going to your place? - She meant your place. Hey, fuck no. I'm sorry, we'll be there in 12 minutes, so... - I can't go home! - Your phone! For the record, it wasn't me. I think it was the alcohol. Hey... does Daniela have a boyfriend? I mean like, do you think she'd be down for a guy like me? I love her laugh. Did you give him alcohol? - If you ever break into my house again... - Did you give him alcohol? - How'd you know we had come here? - Daniela... People saw you leaving together. And Apolo knows my father as well as I do. He would never come home like this. The doctor's trick suits you. My grandfather died and nobody helped him, so... I began to read about medicine. What happened? Anaphylaxis. When your blood doesn't receive any oxygen it gets filled up with carbon dioxide. - You feel like you're being buried alive. - Ares. Hey. What was it? An allergy? Let's say the world is a minefield, and we all walk around like Bigfoot. Do you also have allergies? To you. And chlorine. You're lying. I saw you swimming in your pool the other day. Is it so boring you can't finish it? Come on, are you always snooping on people? What time is it? Six o'clock. Alright. Well, my father is about to get up and go to work. But until he leaves, Apolo and I can't go back. So I'm gonna have to stay here. Hey. Move over a little. And who told you that you can get in my bed? May I? What about you? Are you staying up reading or coming to bed? Ares. And? Tell me more, girl. I mean, I've also seen him going into his room with a thousand girls. But he got in your bed this time, right? Come on, we've been alone together in Raquel's room a bunch of times, and nothing happened. I don't know what other signs that you need. He could have stayed overnight, and, well, he didn't. You two fucked while his brother was sleeping next to you. I get horny just thinking about it. No, we didn't fuck. We just fooled around, okay? Precisely. It's obvious he likes you. And I don't know if that's a good thing. Anyway guys, see you later. Can I have a licorice? If it's so old, I don't know why it's called Modernism. You didn't even look at your notes, did you? You're the one studying literature. I'll have to trust your wisdom now. As long as I can trust you. Where do we sit? A message. When we finish, I want to explain something to you. Who's it from? DON'T LET MY BROTHER TAKE IT. ARES Is it Ares? Stay here, please. I'll be back. - I'll come along. - No. Study. Good afternoon. Who is it? I came to return something to Ares. Come in. Hi. Hello. I'm Claudia. - Would you please tell him... - He's waiting in the game room. Follow me. He's up there, to the right. Have a good one. You think your boyfriend will like it? Very funny. What are you doing? I'm studying for an exam. When are we meeting? - I don't know. You tell me. - We had fun the other day, huh? Yeah. So, do you want to find out where my new piercing is? I'm guessing you won't tell me over the phone, right? No. You will have to see it in person. - I have to go. - Ares, when are we... You know it's rude to turn down a gift, don't you? My phone is working. My screen is broken but it works fine. Yeah, but my brother broke it. I told him it's okay. It's just a phone. Just keep it, okay? Don't be so proud. Are you toying with me? I'm just trying to be a nice person. To me and how many other girls? Does that bother you? It's a nice gesture, but I don't want it. You know, you're a lot more stubborn than the other girls. And a lot more of a... witch. What are you doing? I have a question for you. I have to go. Can I kiss you? Are you sure? Have you done this before? Sure? Yes, I'm sure. Dinner's almost ready. Where's Raquel? She had to go back to school. She forgot to grab some notes. - Want to stay for dinner? - What you got? Take the phone. When you're horny, you know where I am. Fucking dickhead. - Hello? Yoshi... - I'm not hungry, mom. - Raquel. - And I don't want to study. - Raquel. - Where are the notes? We'll study some other day, Yoshi. I'm sorry for wasting your time. She wasn't at school, was she? It looked as if the city had synced to obstruct Carla's path. Once again, she was late. "The more you're in a hurry..." DANIELA WOW. SURE IT WASN'T A DREAM? I SOMETIMES DREAM I BANG PEOPLE HA HA HA. She thought her father would grind his teeth... I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA DIE A VIRGIN. I WAS WORRIED. But then she realized, she wasn't just her normal kind of late. She was extra late. WELL, YOU SEE, I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ...and her coat in the other. While she ran, she thought of her father's teeth grinding... EASY TO GET INTO TROUBLE, HARD TO GET OUT. Raquel! ...the last time she was late, he said he knew she would be. With all those images swirling in her mind, Carla entered the roundabout towards the hospital. How long had it been since she started spending every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday on that road? How long since she'd been trapped in this pattern? All this was bouncing around her brain cells when she got a call from her father. The ringtone had already become a classic. Even more than... I wasn't expecting to see you again. You have some guts. I just came to pick something up and I'll be gone. Mm-hmm. - Serious guys? - Don't cry. Come on. Well, there they are. Please, come on. Sami! - Come on! - Gonna play with us? You are? Whoo! Raquel! What are you doing here? Come here. Hey guys, this is Raquel. Best neighbor ever. Sit here. - Hi. - We're playing never have I ever. We all know how to play, right? We all do. - This girl's so hot. - Thanks man, you can put dibs on her. Kids can't play this game. For fuck's sake. I knew it. Let him do it. He's old enough. Did you hear that, Apolo? Stop drinking. Come on. Who's going to start? You first if you've got the balls. Alright. Never have I ever... run away from home. Okay, that wasn't bad. - Like most people. - Sit down already. - Sami and Marcos, always the same. - Excuse you. What? Never have I ever... broken anyone's heart. - What do you think? - Did I break your heart? I don't know. - You tell me. - Drink up. At this rate, we'll all end up lit except for these two. - Maybe because I'm not an asshole. - Shut up! You fucking child. Never have I ever spied on anyone. - What's with that? - What'd you say? Why would you say that? Okay, this is getting... Never have I ever dated anyone in this circle. I guess you better drink. - These guys have done everybody. - Shut up. Don't say that. - The Hidalgos are something else! - I know. - Never have I ever given a girl head. - Here we go. - Alright, let's go, boys. - Unless you want to drink up too? - Well, well. Ares Hidalgo. - No, there's no way. - Have you never gone down on a girl? - You're lying. That's very personal. - He's full of shit. - Sorry for asking, Mr. Personal. - I don't know what to say. - Me neither. Never have I ever... Surprise us. ...been in a pool wasted. Hey, there. Okay! Yeah! - It's saltwater. - My chlorine allergy is real. I didn't come here to swim. Where's my necklace? It's upstairs. Is that you? With my grandpa. That picture's very old. I'll get you something dry. Be right back. You can use this as a dress. Ares, do you have feelings for me? Salt makes everything better. I'm sorry. Ready? - Good morning. - Good morning. Juice? There you go. Take Ares' plate away. He'll have breakfast later. What are you doing? Helping you escape. Claudia. YOSHI Oh. Ares had to go out. When will he be back? Late. - Did he ask you to tell me that? - Do you really want me to answer? Do you want cream with your coffee? Have a good morning. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARES, WE CAN. I'M AN IDIOT. THANKS 4 PUTTING UP WITH ME. LOVE YOU LOVE YOU TOO FROM DOWN HERE, YOUR ROOM LOOKS CLEAN. I don't know if you're ready to try this beauty I've prepared. To us, Raquel. Whoa, are you trying to drown all your sorrows in booze? I see you two found the bar and all. Always right on cue, Daniela. You enjoying the party? Thank you for inviting us. Technically, you invited yourselves, but that's okay. - Please, go away. - What? The party is great. Please. Daniela! Hey, guys. - Are you two dating, then? - Of course not. - Can you give us a sec, please? - I won't fuck up any more phones. - Yeah, I know! Just give us a sec. - Come on. I didn't know how to tell you. It's okay. He might not be here. We came all the way here to have a good time. Who's with me? - I'm with you. - Cool. Let's go, then. Hey, Dani. See you later, crazy fingers. VALLE DEL TENAS HIGH SCHOOL Yoshi! Seriously, I could have never imagined it was going to be you. The hero that saved our night! I'm happy to announce, that the party is not over yet. I have a surprise waiting for you guys! Whoo! I didn't expect the night to end like this. Almost naked? Are the bubbles coming out yet? No! I almost got it. It's nice here, just the two of us. If you wanna come some other day, I'll put you on the list. Oh, really? I mean, I have lots of other girls lined up. These days, being a virgin at 18 is kind of exotic. Yeah, I guess I am a lucky girl, after all. Yeah. You're lucky I'm wearing underwear today. Can we talk seriously, Yoshi? Depends on what kind of date this is. If everyone knew how amazing you are, you'd have half the school after you. As long as you know, that's good enough for me. You're the best plan planner I've ever met, Yoshi. - Are you okay? - Yep. Are you sure? Don't lose your glasses down there! Yoshi, get out of there! Yoshi! Hurry up! Hurry! - What happened? - Hurry up! Come on, you can do it! - Hurry! - Hurry! Let's go! I'm sorry, I just wanted to produce bubbles! - What the fuck happened? - I'm sorry! Now run! - Take her home, okay? - What do you mean? You don't want me to come up? I'd like to. I'm sorry. HAC-KO DECODING PASSWORD 455H0L3 I HATE U BECAUSE U MAKE ME FEEL THINGS AND I DON'T WANT TO Where are my keys? I had them right here. Where the hell are they? Hey, princess. Want us to take you somewhere? Get in the car. Don't be shy. Hey, we don't bite. Watch yourself, Little Red Riding Hood. No. What are you doing here? Did you have a good time? - Go away. - Okay, come on. - Let's go. - No. Let's go. Ares! Here we go. I need to forget you. Not that I want to, okay? - I just need to do it. - Right. I told you to go away. Ow. Sleep. - You'll feel better. - I'm not sleepy right now. Alright. Just lay down. Tell me a love story. Tell me a story, and then you're not ever coming back. I promise I won't write about it anywhere. Once, there was a little boy... who thought his parents were the perfect couple. And that he had the best home in the world. And what happened to that boy? The boy's father took many business trips around the world and left his wife and kids alone a lot. One day, the boy was early coming home after getting an A on a tough exam. His father was traveling so he... went looking for his mother. He just wanted to make his mother proud, you know? So he ran into her bedroom, but when he went in, she... She had another man in her bed. The kid was so afraid of... losing the family that he loved so much, he told his older brother. Then, despite the boy's pleading, he told their father... who quickly summoned for him. And the boy couldn't stop crying, his father grabbed him and showed him pictures of women around the world and told him that he'd also met lots of people. "Aren't things going well?" he said. "Love makes us weak." "That's why you're crying right now." The end. Do you think love is a weakness? It is. That's why you've never fallen in love? That's not what I said. So, have you? I think I have. Good morning. You're gonna wear it out with all that reading. Is everything okay? Later, you can tell me how you got in yesterday - when you left your keys inside. - Take it down a notch, mom. Kiddo, for your first time drinking you sure went for it. Your breakfast is on the table. I'm going to get you an aspirin. THIS MESSAGE WAS DELETED. WITCH TYPING... LEAVE ME ALONE WITCH TYPING... ONLINE Come in. - We'll leave the sales forecast as is? - Yes, for now. Have a seat. Until now, I thought your high school sent us your grades to remind us of how well they do their job so they can keep charging us tuition. But today, I realized that's not why. They send them so they can keep charging us but they expect us to do all the work. They expect us to bring our children into our offices and tell them how the grades they've received in recent weeks don't measure up to their future responsibilities. Ares, some day you will sit on the board of Alpha 3 and you can't fail us. Studying economics is not easy, especially at Stanford. Years ago, you and I had a chat... an important one. Do you remember what we discussed that day? - Do you, son? - Of course. Very good. Sleep with as many women as you like. But forget about that girl. Seriously. Tie your laces. Hey. Yo, get off of me. - Literal shit, did you see their Insta? - Careful! - What's up? - They come here for classes. Did you shit in your pool again? - Let me see. - It's not a fucking toilet. - What's up? - Shit pigs! - Let me see. - That's so disgusting. - Shut the fuck up. - Are they gonna take over our field? Yo, hey. They lose every match anyway. - I can't believe they'd shit in the pool. - That's gross. You're such an asshole. - Shoot, come on! - Let's go! Come on, move the ball! - Yeah, that's it. - Watch out! That's good. Keep going. - Get up! - Come on! Go! Pass it! - Goal! - Yeah! WITCH! If you're not a student, you can't come in. I just need a minute. I need to tell someone something. - Don't push it. - I'll just be a moment. I promise. I didn't know you had security... You didn't have to dedicate that goal to me. - Raquel, I just wanted you to... - It wasn't necessary. I've been thinking. I've been thinking about what I did to you. Shh. And I think I made a mistake. Are you apologizing? Yes. I'm telling you that... I'd like to do things right. - If you want. - What does that even mean to you? Shh. Ask you out on a date. Ask me out on a date? There's a costume party on Saturday. We could go. You behave like a piece of shit, show up, apologize, then think that's enough for me to forget everything? - Do you really think I'm that stupid? - No. Then, what? Raquel. I have never felt this way. I understand how you might have felt because of me. If some day, even if it's a long time from now, if you want to start from scratch... let me know, please. Because I'll be waiting. I'm gonna be free Saturday evening. You said you wanted to do things right. Yoshi! I have to study, and I can't focus in the library. What's going on? Are you going out with him? I mean, he apologized to me. And you just believed him? I won't let him hurt me, okay? Raquel, he's already hurt you. You really can't see? He's using you. Using me for what? I like him, he likes me, so... What's wrong with that? You deserve better than Ares. - He's not even fit to lace up your boots. - You don't know him. But I know you, Raquel. Much better than he's ever going to know you. Just because I'm dating him doesn't mean we can't be friends anymore. Look, Raquel, I don't know if we ever were friends. But I know it was never enough for me. Yoshi... And when he dumps you, like one of the thousand girls he's been with, don't expect me to pick you up. Because for the very first time, I won't be there. KARMA'S A BITCH, GREEK GOD. - I'm leaving, mom! - Have fun, kiddo. It's obvious my costume's a thousand times better than yours. You coming? Excuse me, but this is the wrong way. There's been a change of plans. And the party? Are we still going? I found something way more intimate. More intimate, as in an office building? Never know. Do you bring all your dates here? I've never brought anyone. VIP pass to Olympus. I don't know if it's Olympus, but it's pretty close. When did you set this up? You're good at writing, and I'm good at surprising you. You think I'm a good writer? It's too bad you don't show the world what you write. Your father wrote The Temple, right? Mm-hmm. How many times have you read it? Hundreds. Is it still good? Very. It should've been published. Why isn't it? What's the plan? Dinner. And after that? We can do whatever you want. Won't you come with me to the prom? You have dances like that at your school? We've got better vibes than you guys. Okay. I'm taking that as a yes. Would you tell your brother the reason for next week's party? Liuhao is now in our customer portfolio. With them, we will double our current investments. The party will help us get new customers, have more visibility in the press. Do you know what would happen if these images got into the hands of executives at Liuhao? I assume they would see us as more attractive and they might invest more in us, right? Good. That's what you want to do with the company when you come back from Stanford? Very well. I'm not going to the US. Sorry. You have no idea what it means to sweat and work hard for what you want. - You don't have the slightest idea. - You're not wrong. Ares! No cutting. Keep the desserts coming. My shift is not over yet. I've come to stay. I'm sorry. I've come to stay with you. I'll go to medical school and pay for it myself. - Get in line. - I can't talk. - I'm not here to talk to you. - The cups are for recycling. - I came to talk to her. - Raquel, what's happening here? It doesn't look like you have as much experience as you claimed. - It's my first time taking out the trash. - Do you want a medal? Claudia. Oh, Artemis. FAST FOOD L'AEROPORT, 1983 FAST FOOD L'AEROPORT, 1983 CALL No answer. Sure. I'm leaving, sweetie. Where are you going looking so pretty? I have a date. - Are you working today? - Yes, I'm catering. I'll be home late, please don't wait up for me. I love you. Are you sure about this? Of course. It's a family thing, and you're my girlfriend. It's a company party. Family and company are the same to them. They know I'm coming, right? Don't worry about it. Raquel! I'm flipping out. I knew something was up. Mom, Dad, this is Raquel, my girlfriend. - Nice to meet you. - Very beautiful party. Well, Alpha 3 is progressing and we should celebrate. I know you're already familiar with our offices. Didn't we order some cava? - We did. - The food is fine, but the service... It's not the usual one, is it? - Cava? - Did you like it or not? It wasn't bad. The tenor was absolutely brilliant. - Pisaroni? - Opera. Palka. When Johannes is conducting, he makes him shine. The Liceu is such a beautiful place. Mom, not everyone has been to the opera. They should, dear. You've never been to Liceu? - I'll be right back. - Careful! Raquel, are you alright? - Are you hurt? - Kiddo. - Leave me alone. - The photographer. Tell the band to keep playing. Raquel, wait! - Please, wait! - Were you trying to humiliate me? Raquel. What's wrong? They didn't even know I was coming. Why am I here? I didn't know your mother was going to be here. Do you love me, Ares? You okay? - Do you actually like her? - I don't need you to help me. If you really liked her, you'd spare her these parties. You only brought her as a trophy to show dad how big of a rebel you are. Raquel is not a trophy. I brought her because you made me come. I wanted to be with her. We made you come? You said you'd do what you wanted with your life. You brought her here, knowing it would hurt her. - I should've asked you? - You're making a fool of yourself. - Because I do everything wrong? - You make french fries. Do you think you're fooling anyone by wearing that uniform? It's almost offensive. We are the Alpha 3. Artemis, Apolo, and you, Ares. It's absurd to deny who you are. And you and Claudia? Are you with her to rebel or because you actually love her? The thing with Claudia is over. Honey? I brought you dinner. I'm sure you didn't eat anything. Everything's delicious. Kiddo, come on. There's plenty of leftovers. You looked very beautiful tonight, you know? By the look on your face, the party was a hit. Want hot chocolate? Please make two. - Are you flunking? - Well, I've had worse things happen to me. Look at me! Look! - Wow. An A+, nice work. - I know Hey, teach. What the hell is he doing? Are you insane? Would you go to prom with me? I'll be the boyfriend you deserve. You can't be so childish, Apolo. You're just too young for me. - Just hear me out. - It was just a fling. L'AEROPORT I still have four minutes of my break left. Mine was a little while ago. Andrea will be pissed if she sees you here. Raquel, I'm sorry about what happened. And I'm sorry I slapped you. Wanna do something later? Or tomorrow? The dance is tomorrow. Can I go? If you don't want me to, I won't. But I'd like to. To be honest, I'd prefer you don't. Okay. So, you'll go with Yoshi? I think he's into you. I should go now. Are you staying out here? No. I'm heading home. You know, I wish I could quit a job just because I can. Raquel. What? I gotta go. Should I say something to Andrea? No, I'll call her later. Ciao. - Hello. That's the cake, isn't it? - Hi. Yeah. Give me a moment. I'll go get your money. All the board members are very pleased with Artemis. Our clients see the family as an asset. You'll see when you have to deal with them. Yes, but that's still a long way off. Well, you know, time flies when you're at Stanford. You should ask your brother about it. It was a good idea for you to take care of the party. You handled it pretty well. Both the press and the catering incident. Rodrigo was delighted. Rodrigo was there for the canapés. That's all. If you keep this up, it'll be easy when we want to bring in Ares. It's 9 p.m. I'll make dinner if you want. And the prom? Kiddo. Sorry, mom. Don't worry, honey. I'm sorry about the other day. I was so stupid. Please, forget about it. No, but it's not okay because I was tricked. And may I ask who tricked you? Ares? No. I guess I tricked myself because I thought it was possible. And it isn't? No. Do you know why dad never published his novel? Because nobody wanted to publish it? He never took it to any publisher. That can't be true. He never had the courage to do it. You're lying. He was a great writer, but he always believed he wasn't really good enough. I miss your father so damn much. But please, don't follow in his footsteps. If you like Ares, cut out all the drama and tell him. Are we expecting someone tonight? No, Raquel. It's not a good time. - I need to talk to Ares. - Raquel! I'll handle this. My father's waiting for his cava. I'm sorry. - We're having dinner. - Can I come in? Don't waste your time. Just go back home. Ares! There's no point, Raquel. Go back home. It's alright, Claudia. Juan asked for the cava. - I'm sorry for what I said! - What would you like us to do? It's simple. Open the wine you brought to celebrate. - What do you think? - I love the cakes from that shop. They're delicious. Where were we? AR3S I NEED YOU, RAQUEL. I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE PROM. We're still having dinner, Ares. Apolo. - A toast. - A toast. To all good things to come. To all good things. WE'RE FINALLY OUTTA HERE WELCOME TO PROM - Daniela, have you seen Ares? - Sorry. I haven't, babe. - What's up? - I have a boyfriend. What do you mean, boyfriend? He's way more handsome, way more intelligent, way more everything. - And where is this boyfriend? - I don't know what I'm doing here. Where's the dance? Thanks. Yoshi. Best friend and future husband, right? Raquel is lucky to have friends like you. I mean, I never had friends like you. To you, Raquel is just another girl to pass the time, isn't she? Fuck for a while, have some fun and leave. I don't want to argue, Yoshi. How many times are you planning to break her heart? - I'm here for her. - How many? - I need to speak to Raquel, man. - And if not, what are you going to do? Smash my face in? Or maybe you'd rather buy me a cell phone then dump me too. But then you'll ask me out, tell me you're a new person, that you've changed, that now you know better. After that... you ghost. Because that's your MO, and you're going to keep doing that at Stanford, won't you? Hey! What's this? Hey! If you really care about her, you should go away and stop hurting her. You're right. I've been a dickhead. But I can't stay away from her. When she's not near, I feel like I can't breathe, Yoshi. Mm-hmm. And I really don't care if I'm breathing, the only thing that matters is she is. Punch me. Come on. This way, we can start from scratch. Do it. 08:57 THURSDAY, 29 APRIL Raquel. Raquel. Yoshi! You were right. I'm sorry about everything these last few weeks. You're the only person that's always been there for me. And I couldn't see it. Raquel, I have something to tell you. Ares is here. We ran into each other at the entrance. We argued, then he fell into the pool. - Did you say pool? - Listen, he's fine. Ares! Ares! Ares! Ares! Ares! Ares! Breathe. Ares! Breathe. Help! Help me! Help! - Yoshi! - Grab it! Hold on. Hello, y'all. My boyfriend, Apolo. Here he is. He's younger than me, but who cares? When I'm old, it will all be a plus. You'll be the prettiest grandma in the world. So cute. AMBULANCE Come on. Since you came into his life, everything's gone wrong. My daughter loves your son, Mr. Hidalgo. - If you don't know what love is... - Who are you to tell me about my... Juan, just shut up! Hello, everyone. The Hidalgo family, right? I'm Doctor Serra, I'm on the team in charge of your son. Ares has suffered a severe anaphylactic shock. He's in the ICU right now. A lack of respiration... IT ALL BEGAN WITH THE WI-FI PASSWORD I HAVE TO STOP DECEIVING MYSELF... We're told love smells like roses but it turns out it smells like chlorine. And hospitals and fear. And anger. And helplessness. Even so, I don't want to forget everything we experienced together here. Every moment, every corner, every window. Wake up and let me feel you in my arms again. Let me caress your skin... kiss your lips. Does anyone want to read their story? - Let's see... - Please, wait. Raquel! Wake up and let's face our fears together. - ...four and five. I said it's... - We have to talk. Because of you, I believe in love. Now I just need love to believe in us. What potion did you give me, witch? Ares? I hope it doesn't have any side effects. How are you? I love you, Raquel. So, look who's laughing now, Greek god. Ares spent two more weeks under observation and then went home. And at home, we basically made love. - Come on, let's go. - You're going to be late! On the bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen. Coming! At the Fast Food restaurant and the beach. We spent all summer in each other's arms and on the last day, we might have dragged our goodbye out for a little too long. Let's go. Hurry up, sweetheart. What happened that day in the pool didn't just affect Ares. The fear of losing their son shook up the Hidalgos' principles. You're an idiot. Their priorities changed, and Alpha 3 and the family became very different things. You're going to be late. Dad. Leave it there. Coming. But mom, what did you put in the bag? After the scare and after my visit, they finally agreed to let Ares study medicine. He didn't want to leave. But, now that his family was all for it, in the end I convinced him to study at the best medical school in the world. Safe flight! We all would have loved if that university had been in Barcelona, but, unfortunately for us, it was in Stockholm. And so, after all we'd been through, Ares went 1,800 miles away to study what he had always dreamed of. Sorry. The day we said goodbye, I found out that this story, our story, had begun earlier than I had imagined. - I have a confession to make. - He said. Right now? I broke my Wi-Fi on purpose so I could talk to you. What? That's what he told me. Just like that. He gave me the gift of the truth. Then we kissed, and he left. Ares, the plane won't wait for you! I'll be back soon, witch. I saw him walking away, gradually fading among the other travelers until he disappeared. That's when I realized that love did believe in us. It believed so much in what Ares and I had built that it taught us to let it go of it. I also gave him a final present. Something more straightforward. A tiny little souvenir. Truth is, at that point, we both had learned that, sometimes, loving somebody also means giving that person up. Giving something up is part of love, same as love is part of life. 4 MONTHS LATER Ares always says I taught him how to love, but he taught me something even more important. He taught me to believe in myself. And to finally be brave enough. THROUGH MY WINDOW RAQUEL MENDOZA I'M GONNA SMOTHER YOU WITH KISSES AND THEN WHAT? I'd take your clothes off and bring you to the bed. I'M NAKED AND LYING ON THE BED Imagine I'm there. Imagine I'm right next to you. My hand starts to go up your leg. And it stops as it reaches the top of your thigh. And I gently touch you. I caress you up and down and, very slowly, I put my fingers inside of you. And then we make love. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NAKED You were supposed to be 2,000 miles away. What are you doing? So, have you come back to return my panties? I've come to get a new pair.
