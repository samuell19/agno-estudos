I hate that alarm clock. I got it. Stay. You know I can't. I've got a nice warm bed and some underwear with your name on it. Promise me that when your next deal is done, you'll take a few days off. Just you and me. I promise. Just you and me. Today, we close the deal on the sale that we've been working on the last few weeks. This is gonna be good for us. Sure it will. This is going to be a good one. And when it is, we can celebrate. Sounds like a plan. You know, I still don't get why people pay so much money for an old painting or some random dot on a page. It's because you have no class, dear. Did you just hear that? What? I swore I just heard something, oh, that was it. Said you needed one of these. They certainly broke the mold when they made you, that's for sure. And that's exactly why you love me. Ben? What are you doing? There was someone here. What? Someone was standing where you are right now. Nope, just me. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah, how was your day? To be honest, if it started bad, it just got worse. I take it the sale didn't go through? In a nutshell, no message, no calls, nothing. We had all the papers ready to go. A complete time-waster. Now he's not even returning our calls. So after sir's hard day at work, maybe there's a way to help take your mind off of things. Sorry, I'm just gonna grab a shower and get to bed. It's been a hell- - It's fine, you just get your head down and relax. Okay, thanks. Hey, Ellie. How's my favorite girl doing? I'm good, just gettin' on with my dissertation and it's killing me. 15,672 words and counting. Very precise, it also sounds like hell. It is. I don't envy you one bit right now. Thanks for caring. That's what friends are for, but if you're busy, I can go. No, it's okay. I could do with a distraction, if I'm honest. I was hoping that you'd say that. I was thinking it's been a little while since we had a bit of a girl time. How about me and you hit the Cuba? Tonight? Yeah, why not? As much as I would love a cocktail with my girl, I really can't tonight. How about Thursday? Perfect, that would certainly be doing nice. What was that noise? You heard that? Yeah, of course I heard it. What was it? Lucy? Lucy? What, you okay? Yeah, it was a crow. What are you talking about? The sound we heard was a crow hitting the window. Ah, is it dead? I think so. Strange, they don't normally kill themselves like that, unless, I saw a thing- - Please, I could really do without any signs and advice on superstition right now. Just give me a minute while I sort this out and I'll give you a call back. All right, no worries. Let me know if you need me, okay? I'll speak to you later. Speak to you later. How's my girl doing? Missing you. How was your day? What? Nothing, just admiring the view. Thank you. You're not so bad yourself, mister. Did you speak to Jason today? You didn't say anything, did you? You know you really can't put this off? - As I said... - Yeah, I'm fully aware of what you said. Can't I just come back, say "Hi, honey, I'm home," and just get on with it? If you really wanna know how my day went, it was the same as yesterday. Shit. How was your day? I got most of my work done. Then I worked out on the bike and a crow killed itself by hitting the window. What? Can I ask you a random question? And I know this may sound a little weird and out of the blue but who owned this house before you? What's that gotta do with anything? I'm just curious. I have no idea. It's a relatively new build. The owners no longer wanted it, so they moved out, moved to Australia, I think. Did they ever tell you anything about the house? Tell me about what? Anything strange or odd happening? Why would they tell me that? I don't know. Maybe they were experiencing something weird. You mean like, as in being haunted? Maybe. Wow, this is a really exciting conversation over here. Please, I've just been feeling a little uneasy since I moved in, that's all. Uneasy about what? Like I can't settle. What the fuck does that mean? I just feel like sometimes I'm not alone in the house. The house isn't fucking haunted, Lucy! Do you know what? Don't worry about it. I won't, I'm off to bed. Ben, don't do that. Ben! It's definitely strange. You sure it wasn't just some weirdo playing some kind of sick prank? There was no one there when I took the picture. Come on, look, you can clearly see it, it's some crank in a coat or something. I'm not lying. You hear about people pulling pranks like this all the time. Look at that clown craze that was going around, where people were standing outside in those clown suits. That was all kinds of messed up. I can promise you there was no one there. There was no one there when I took the picture. No one. If it's what you say, then... I guess you have every right to be scared. What's this? Madam, dinner shall be served in 10 minutes. Your presence is requested, should you care to indulge in some ala carte food, served with nothing but love. What's on the menu? Pizza and chips. Oh, my favorite! You certainly know how to treat a lady. Well, I'll go get ready. Lucy, I'm sorry about last night. I've been under a lot of pressure with work lately and I just... All work and no play, I guess. It's okay. I'm going to go and get ready. Thank you for tonight. I really needed this. Are we out of the woods yet? I guess that depends on what's for dessert. Ah, dessert. You forgot about it? Well, not exactly. There's custard in the fridge. Custard? Wow, you've really blown it now, mister. You'll just have to make it up to me some other way. And that is? For me to know and for you to find out. I was thinking about that picture that you sent me earlier. I was thinking- - Can we just leave this until later? I just wanna enjoy this moment with you. No interruptions. No interruptions. You're really something. I'm so lucky to have you. A girl could get used to all these compliments. Keep 'em coming. I mean it. I know you do. I think I'm gonna get another glass of wine, and then we're going upstairs. And you're getting me out of these clothes. What the fuck are you doing now? I did nothing. I turned around and all the cupboards were open. They didn't just open on their own! Why won't you believe me? What is it with you? You really know how to fuck shit up! Lucy, I didn't mean, Lucy! I'm coming, Nana. It's out there! It's out there! What is? It was right by the door. There's nothing there. I promise you, I see it! See what? The man in the hat. Oh, this again? Please, Ben! I'm not lying to you. Just stop it, Lucy, stop it! What is it with you, huh? Huh? You don't believe me? Why won't you believe me? Look up for me. And to the left. And the right. Have you been getting much sleep? A little. I guess I've been pretty hectic with coursework lately. So not much sleep, in other words? Apart from being a little rundown, I can't see anything wrong. I would suggest trying to take things a little easier and try and avoid too much stress if you can. Here's what I'll do. I will prescribe you some of these, and these will help you sleep, if you need it, okay? There you go. Great. There I was studying to help others deal with their problems, and here I am unable to deal with my own. Ah, babe, don't get upset. You'll work it out. So have you told him how you feel? No, I just can't bring myself to say anything. I don't wanna say it, but maybe he just needs to lose you. You're not helping, Ellie. No, what I mean is, when he realizes what you actually mean to him, you'll be gone and it'll be too late. You're a great girl who any guy would give his right testicle to be with. Look at you, you're a stunner. I definitely wouldn't say no. Oh great, now you're trying to hit on me. You're a funny one. That's me. You know I'm here for you if you ever need anything. I hate seeing you upset because you deserve to be happy. And if that means that you need to tell him exactly how you feel, then you need to tell him exactly how you feel. Thank you. It's nothing. I just like to see my girl doing well. You have seen him. Pardon? You've seen him, haven't you? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. You can't run. The man in the hat, you've seen him. Get off of me. He won't stop until he has you. Don't let him in. Get off me! The woman I just mentioned approached me in the toilet earlier, and started talking about the shadow man in the photo, and how I shouldn't let him in or something like that. Was she a psychic or something? I don't know. She didn't say who she was. That's a bit odd. I really don't know what to say. I mean, there must be someone or somewhere that you can go to talk to you about that. Like a church or something. I honestly don't know. I haven't looked. Well, let's get looking. Maybe we need to find someone that focuses on spirits or ghosts or something. I know I probably sound really crazy. You don't sound crazy. It's me. Back home, there were all these stories about La Bruja, which means witch in English. There were all these reports of young boys being woken up in the middle of the night and being held down by this shadow. And they'd wake up with scratches all up their arms and legs. I knew one of the guys and I saw the scratches. So I believe you. Ah, here you go. Dr. David Andrews. He's the author of a book called "Walking With Shadows." And by the looks of it, he claims to have had a ghostly encounter with the man in the hat. Seems like you're not the only one that's seen this guy, shadow thing. It also says seeing the shadow man, AKA a man in the hat usually has a connotation to a sense of heavy presences, tense and sometimes violent atmospheres through relationship, marital breakdowns, and or physical and mental abuse. Visitations of the hat man, even though uncommon, usually occur in a heightened state of sleep where an individual wakes up and is paralyzed. The phenomenon known as sleep paralysis shares common blah-blah-blah, he's your guy. There's a phone number and an address here on the website. All you have to do is reach out. What have you got to lose? Yes? Hi, Dr. David Andrews? Whatever you're trying to get me to sign up to, I'm not interested. I promise you, I'm not trying to sell anything. I just really need to talk to you. Good day. Please, it's about the man in the hat that you talk about in your book. I've seen him. Have a seat. Found what you're looking for? Oh, I'm sorry, I just- - Let's just cut to the chase, shall we? Why are you here? I don't know what else to do. I was hoping maybe you could help. What makes you think I have answers to whatever it is you want to ask? I don't know. In your book, you wrote about- - Ah, the book. The book, the book, the book. Been a little while since anyone asked me about that. You're a journalist, aren't you? A journalist looking for a free ride and a laugh, just like all the rest. You care not for the consequence. Just the result of a good story. Go ahead and take your shot. At the moment, there's no one here. Just me now. I shouldn't have come here. Sorry for wasting your time. It's attracted to stress, you know. What did you say? Stress, it, they, him. They're attracted to it. Why do you say that? It's why you're here, isn't it? I've seen that look before. What are you talking about? Fear. I can see it dwelling in your eyes. I know that look all too well. It's your eyes that gave you away. You have a certain humility that's quite endearing. A little too honest to be a journalist. I'm sorry about being tough on you. I just needed to be sure. It's okay, I understand. I don't think you do. What have you seen? I saw something. What did it look like? Tall, black hole of a man in a hat. Like the drawings in your book. If you've seen him, they already have started. What has started? Seems you may have been chosen. What? What do you mean? I could never really figure out why. It could be an opening from a childhood trauma. A house you live in, the land, perhaps. Who knows? The only thing I could ever be sure of was that it's like a parasite looking for a host, any sign of weakness, any opportunity to feed off negative energy, it'll thrive from it. You have seen the entity. My guess is it's attached itself to you already. It's only a matter of time now. Time? Until what? I'm not sure if you're a person of faith or if you even believe in the supernatural, but if you're ever gonna start praying, now would be a good time. And what's that supposed to mean? Dr. Andrews, tell me. It's time you leave. I've got work to do. But, but you- - You must go now! Thank you for your time. My name's Lucy, by the way. Lucy, no matter what anyone says, or however crazy you might feel, don't let him in. Lucy. Nan? Hello? I love you, darling. I love you too, Nana. I love you too. Thank you for letting him in. Can you believe this? They've been talking about this so-called government deal for months now, and they still can't decide what to do. And you would've think they knew what they were doing with this country. It's almost like they want the economy to collapse. Is the heating off? It's cold. It's no different from any other morning this week. Where were you last night? Just thought it best to give you some space. How thoughtful. Please, let's not argue again. If we've got nothing nice to say, I'd rather not talk. Always running away. What's that mean? Nothing, Ben. Nothing. My Nan used to make me waffles. It's funny, the memories we hold on to, it's always the little things we miss the most. I never did tell you the real reason why I lived with my Nan. It feels like the more I try to hide from my past, the further I can feel you slipping away. Where's this all come from? I know it's been two years since you lost your Nan, and there's nothing wrong with grieving. No. But some people take more time to get over things. I mean it's fine. It's perfectly normal. It's not about that. Maybe we should get you checked out. Seeing all the doctors help- - It's not about that! God, why won't you ever listen to me? You didn't finish what you were saying, about why you lived with your Nan. Forget about it, it doesn't matter. No, it does matter, it does. We just both need to let our guards down for a moment. For a big part of my younger life, I was terrorized by things I couldn't explain. Things a little girl should never see. My mum and dad thought that I was being tormented by demons and that I needed to find faith. So they would wake me up in the middle of the night and stand me naked in the garden as they splashed me with holy water, reciting prayers from the Bible. Eventually I tried to run away. Anywhere was better than living there with them. And that's when my Nan took me in. All my crazy experiences stopped soon after. For the first time in my life, I felt free. Free from the pain, free from the suffering. That was until last night, when I felt it again. I'm scared, Ben. I'm really scared. I've never seen you like this. What happened last night? I know this sounds crazy. I even told myself how stupid this sounds, but I was attacked in our bedroom last night. I don't know who or what it was. I couldn't see it, but there was something there. And ever since it happened, I just don't feel right. What? Why didn't you just- - I feel like I'm falling apart. And I don't know what to do. Is everything okay, my child? I'm fine. I can pray for you, if you like? I said I'm fine. Hi, is that Father Roberts? Hi, my name's Lucy Morgan. I'm pretty new to the area, and I just wondered if I could speak with you for a moment. I'm sorry, this can't wait. I really need to speak to you. It's urgent. I don't blame you if you want to leave. I spoke to Jason earlier today. Told him that I'm going to think about our business arrangement, and I needed a few days off. Do you think we're gonna make it? I don't know. I love you. I love you too. Can I get you a drink? What's on the menu? We have coffee, tea, water, and hot chocolate with whipped cream. Hmm, it'll just have to be hot chocolate and whipped cream, I guess. Got it. Hey! What's up, what's wrong? Lucy, pleasure to meet you. Thank you for this. Sorry if I don't seem too with it, I really haven't been sleeping too well lately. Sometimes we all go through something that forces us in different directions. If only you knew. That's why I'm here. What do you fear? Fear is a very relative term. When one learns to be at peace with the Lord, your perception of fear changes. Do you know what I fear? The unknown. I was attacked the other night by a presence I couldn't see. And it happened again last night. Where did this attack happen? In the bedroom and the bathroom. Were you alone at the time? For the first one, yes, but not last night. My partner, Ben, was downstairs. Did he see anything? No, my head doesn't feel like me anymore, now it feels like day and day feels like night. Have you tried prayer? I respect that you believe you're being troubled by forces unseen. And this is to sound in no way patronizing, but sometimes we can think things are real, when in actuality, there's another explanation, not of the supernatural. I know this might not- - Can you help or not? Okay. I don't have much experience with things of this nature, but if you would permit me to, I would like to offer up some comfort in the form of a house blessing. Just something to help put your mind at ease and we can take it from there. Thank you. And what did you say your address was? 11 Croswell Drive. 11 Croswell Drive? Could you do me a favor and write down for me? Lucy? Sorry to trouble you. This is 11 Croswell Drive, isn't it? It is. How may I help? You must be Ben. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Father William Roberts. I believe I was speaking with your partner earlier on today. Lucy? I know this visit is completely unannounced but she left in rather a hurry and I just want to make sure she's okay. Yeah, she's fine. Thanks. Do you mind if I speak with her briefly? I'm afraid now is not a good time. I respect your territory and the fact this may be a complete surprise for you. If you could tell her that I called, I would appreciate that. No worries. Thank you, kindly. Hi, Father. Lucy. Thanks for coming. Please, come in. It's a nice place you've got here. Thanks. Do you want a drink? Coffee, tea, anything? Just a water will be fine. Thank you. I'm here for you. The Lord is here for you. Here you go, priest. Thank you. You seemed somewhat troubled earlier. Is all okay? It's funny. As children, we're told there's no such thing as monsters and we shouldn't be afraid of the dark. We both know that's not true. There may be forces that we can't see at play, but that doesn't always mean they're malevolent. What happens when they are? Do you feel a presence with us now? Since the other night, it's never left. Where is it? Everywhere. I can't believe I'm hearing this. Why? Listen to yourself. You sound nuts. Lucy has reason to believe she's- - Please, priest, I don't mean to be rude- - Ben, please. - And I appreciate that you're here to help. But let's not jump to any conclusions. I don't want her head more confused than it already is with all this spiritual ghost crap. I'm sure there's probably a more logical explanation for all of this. What, that I strangled myself and I'm making this up? Why can't you just believe me? I... I just can't. I accept and love you, not for your money, not for what you can give me, just for you. And I need you now more than ever. As I said earlier, I respect your territory and your beliefs. All I have is a few questions I'd like to ask Lucy and then I'll be on my way. Seems that you both have more to discuss before we can move forward. What's this? Open it. What does it mean? You have no idea? You wrote it. No way. How can I write this when I don't even know what it says? The writing here is in an old Latin text. And what does it say? I don't think what it says is really- - Please, I need to know. The Latin text you wrote translates to I have her now. So you're writing in Latin now? I have no idea how I wrote this. Maybe you didn't. Do you mind if I use the bathroom? Upstairs, first door in front. For Michael, the Archangel, oh, glorious prince of the heavenly armies, defend us in battle and protect us against the wickedness and tyranny of the devil. You okay, Lucy? Lucy? Yeah, I'm fine. Lucy, are you coming to bed? Babe, just come back to bed. Lucy? Lucy, open the door! Lucy, open up! Lucy. What are you doing? Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death... Amen! Sometimes I feel it is important that we know abundance is our birthright. The mental prison we condemn ourselves to is not fulfilling or even gratifying when we judge others and ourselves so harshly. The intended purpose of... The intended purpose... Hello? Father Roberts? That's I. Who's calling? It's Ben. You came to visit Lucy earlier today. Ah, yes. What can I do for you? Is there any, any chance you can come by tonight? Something's not right with Lucy. I'm afraid that I- - Please, I don't know what to do. But that, that is not Lucy. I'll be right over. Thank you. Thank you for coming. How is she? She's been better. I'm sorry. This is really hard for me. I've never seen anything like this before. Where's Lucy? Upstairs, in the bedroom. Is there anything you feel you should tell me first? Please, she's upstairs. You've gotta see for yourself. Do you mind if I use your counter? Go for it. Upstairs on the right. I'm not going up there. I... I just need a minute. You've done the right thing. Lucy? It's me, Father Roberts. Ben asked if I could pay you a visit. Lucy. What do you want, Father? Who are you? This one is mine. Child of the Lord, I pray that you shall be guided and protected from the light of the heavenly father, and that you shall be freed from any affliction and demonic forces around you now. Our father, who art in heaven. Help me. There is absolutely no possible way it can be done that quickly. Please, just listen to the recording. That's all I ask. Even if I did, it changes nothing. It's out of my hands. There must be something you can do. I'm sorry, father. But you have to understand, you're not asking for a simple blessing here. It is a very delicate situation and the correct channels must be followed accordingly. We have to be prudent. You see, that's the problem we have here. The time in the world moves forward, and yet we, as the church, stand still and then you call this approach prudent. More like cowardice, if you ask me. I didn't ask you. You are to do as instructed. Whether we like it or not, the enemy is winning the battle, while we sit here and debate on rules and regulations. And it is by following those rules and regulations that we keep the dignity and the very foundations of the church together. We cannot go around conducting any sort of miscellaneous practice however we see fit, without proper assessment and consultation. That is not how it works. Let me just talk to the Bishop. I can explain why this woman, in my own opinion, needs a rite of exorcism, but most of all, our help. You never see what I saw. The diabolical influence attached to this woman is real, and unlike anything I've ever seen. The Bishop doesn't need to say yes, but let me plead my case. Without careful consideration and approval from the Bishop, you cannot, by any means, pursue this matter further, until I have spoken with the Bishop myself. Is that understood? The tyranny of evil triumphs, chancellor, when good people stand by and do nothing to help. Still reading your Bible, I see. Thank you for coming. Don't mention it. It's been a little while since I've been in one of these. It most certainly has. Things are not what they used to be. You can say that again. Miss it? Not really. Still enjoy it? It has its own cross to bear, but like all things, silver lining and all that. Sounds like the same place of old. Same place of old. I know you've been through a lot. I'm always here when you need me. Do you mind if we cut all the how are you, how am I crap? I know you didn't call me here just to see how things are. There's no other way than for me just to say it, and you're one of the only people I can trust with what I'm about to say. I need to perform a rite of exorcism. Did those words just come out of your mouth? You want to perform an exorcism? Sorry, deliverance ministry? Yeah. On who? A desperate woman with no options left, and it has to happen soon. Tomorrow, in fact, the clock is against me on this. Tomorrow? You know that won't go down well with the Bishop? Will take a few weeks at best for him to sanction it, and that's even if he does. And I thought I was bad. Coming from the man who has lost faith and walked away from life? When I believed my wife should live and he decided otherwise. Let's just say we had a conflict of interest. I would not call running away a conflict of interest. I did not run away. I made a choice for myself, no guilt trips, no one to ask for guidance. Just me deciding what I want for me. Like you, I got into the act of God's work because I wanted to help people. Those who are vulnerable, those who do not have a voice of their own, the woman. This couple that I speak of need our help. Our help? What have I got to do with it? I need you. I can't do this alone. I'm not going to help you while you go on rough shot, conducting your own exorcisms like some sort of witch doctor. Look, I really wish I could help, but I'm not the man I once was. Yes, you are. You were one of the best ministers that I knew. Well, that was before. You cannot keep yourself a slave to the past forever. It changes nothing. Unfortunately, death is as much a part of life as life is to itself. It wasn't your fault, you know? You're right. It wasn't my fault. I know whose fault it was. Him on high, our oh, precious one. 31 years I spent. 31 years, devoted, loving, and caring doing the work for someone else. What thanks did I get? I tell you what I get. People like you telling me that I lost my wife and it was all because the Lord called her home. I'm sick of it. Sick of Him. I'm sick of faith, religion. I'm done with it all. You will find the latest incident on there. She needs our help and that's what I'm going to do. Alone and without consent. I can't live my life concerned only by myself. You know something, you were once someone I looked up to. Interesting, isn't it? What is? How things change. Sorry for wasting your time. Hello? William, I listened to the recording. What time are you leaving tomorrow? I'll be heading over about seven in the evening. How long does it take to get there? 20 minutes, give or take? I'll get to you for six. Change your mind? Don't you think you've drunk enough? Nope. Whatever you're doing or however you think you're dealing with this, you being out of it isn't gonna help Lucy. You know the priest wants to do an exorcism on her tomorrow, right? Now, how would I know that? Why didn't you tell me sooner? I just thought you should know. Are you even being serious right now? You can be a real fucking pig sometimes, you know that? All you're doing right now is thinking about yourself while the woman who loves you and needs you is upstairs dealing with God knows what? And all you can do is this. Oh, fuck. Fuck! I'm gonna go check on Lucy. Are you asleep? Lucy? Lucy? Ellie? Ellie! Ben? I wanna get out. Let go of the handle! I'm not holding it! I can't open it! Get me out, please! It won't move! Get me out, please get me out! I'm trying! I see it. I see it! I've had fucking enough of this! Hello! What's going on? It's gonna be okay. Don't talk to it. This is not Lucy. Why am I tied up? Ben, please, untie me. Ben! Untie me! Lord Jesus Christ, ruler over the heavens, I'm here as your servant. Have mercy. Have mercy. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, by the power of his cross, his blood and his resurrection, I bind you, Satan, and the powers of darkness. I take authority over you, and stand with the power of the Lord God almighty. I, the dealer of death, condemn you to a thousand serpents of pain. Reveal yourself, creature of the night. We are many! Lucy? Don't talk to it! Together, the Lord's prayer. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death... Reveal yourself to me, demon! I'm sorry! I stand with the power of the Lord God almighty. Tell me your name. I am the bearer of darkness that consumes the night and we are legion. And she will burn. The power's out! It's no longer safe for you both. I need you to stay here. But wouldn't it- - I'm afraid you'll only be putting yourself in danger as well as Lucy. Lucy? Fight it, child. By the power invested in me, I command you, legion, to leave this woman at once. Lucy, if you can hear me, resist the dark spirit. Most unclean spirit, in the name of our almighty Lord, I command you to leave this woman at once. Most unclean spirit, in the name of our almighty Lord, I command you to leave this woman at once. I will not leave. She is mine forever! In the name of Christ, I command you, legion, to part. Most unclean spirit, return to the depths of darkness and burn in the eternal flame. Most unclean spirit, in the name of our mighty- - I command you, legion, most unclean spirit, return to the darkness and burn in the eternal flames of hell. In the name of the almighty God, return! Stop the car. What is it? It's nothing.
