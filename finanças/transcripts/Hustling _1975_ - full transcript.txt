[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct police radio chatter] [car honks] [car honks] [indistinct chatter] Would you look at that? 'Right out in the open.' They don't even try to hide it anymore. I tell you what's happening to this city. You can't even walk the streets anymore without being-- The way they stand there, brazen as can be. Nowadays, you can'’t go the blocks from the office to Grand Central without getting a dozen propositions. They're not cheap either. What do you mean, not cheap? How much? Do you wanna find out? Ooh, can you? Of course. [vehicle honks] So, how much? Twenty and ten. You mean $30? If you don't wanna buy it, get lost. [male #1] '$30? The ladies on the bus are gonna' love that, huh?. Ha ha. [cars honking] What did she say? $30. - $30? - Is that all? I thought it'd be much more. Whatever happened to $2. Inflation, Harriet, remember? [laughter] What's the matter? Ain't you ever seen a whore before? Come on. Yeah, you got a lot of nerves sittin'’ there hasslin' me when I'’m out here doing my job. You ain't doing nothing but showing your ignorance. You're a disgrace. You ought to be ashamed selling yourself for money. I'’d rather sell it than lay up in bed and wait for my husband to pay my bills outta his paycheck which is gonna be short $30. Or maybe 50 if he likes me. I don't believe. [indistinct chatter] Get her out of here. Driver! Bet you can't even mate with your wife. Wanda, watch out. [tires screeching] [grunts] Damn it. Wanda, we have to stop meeting like this. [female #1] 'You'd think grown man have something better to do' 'than chase a few girls around the street.' I mean, the whole town-- Okay, girls, let's go. Come on, let's go, let's move it, let's move it. Come on, come on. Keep going, Giselle, come on, let's go. Yeah, I'm movin', I'm movin'. Hey, it's the fall fashion store. [indistinct chatter] Alright, who wants to make a phone call? Baby, I do, I do. Of course. Over here. Wait, oh! Oh, for cryin' out loud, yeah. You'd better hurry up, slut. I gotta call my roommate. 'Roommate? I think you got to call your pimp.' Not me, I'm an independent. [indistinct chatter] Get there and see the matron, they wanna search you. Ivanka, how much money you got? [Giselle] 'Some screw in here ripped me off last week.' Yeah, we know, Giselle, it's a tough life. Yeah, sure. Hi Wanda. What're you doing in here again? Everybody's in here, you could surely count it up, babe. Hey-hey, you got change for a quarter? Sure, honey. I've got nothing better to do. Anybody got any silver nail polish? Here, I've got red glitter with sparkles. Oh, good look. Good, thanks. Hey, listen, how long are we in for? The last van left for call about 20 minutes ago. So, everybody's in for the night. Oh, goddammit, I've been here five nights out of six. I might as well give up my apartment. Have a seat, please. How am I gonna pay my bills, Swifty? You know what time I got out of court today? - 1:00 o'clock. - What're you complaining about? You're all back on the streets and I'm still filling all out forms. How can I book a prostitutes on a typewriter with the broken P? Use the W. - 'Age?' - 19. Occupation? [laughs] I-is he for real? Secretary. Put down that I'm working for the city, sugar. Social security number? Take your time, Giselle. - That's a hard one. - 'Wanda.' Wanda, would you believe this? I was sittin' outside I was havin' some muffin' and havin' a hot dog. This uniform comes up to me and says "Come on, I'’m taking you in." I said, "Takin'’ me in? Can'’t you see I'm eatin'’?" I mean how can I be workin' when I'm eatin', right? [Swifty] 'Your story really touches me--' No, really, this is what turns us girls against you cops. You're takin' someone in for nothin'. Just 'cause one of you creeps wants to make his overtime. Yeah, you girls all have a persecution complex. You think the men enjoy doing this? I've to promise them promotions. Oh, yeah, tell it to me. They love pushin' women around. It's how they get their kicks. Hey, hey, hey, take it easy. [indistinct chatter] They're killing our city. they're killing our city! [clamoring] [siren wailing] [male #2] 'I want to know who's paying the police..' ...the taxpayers or the prostitutes?' [male #3] '’Just a minute, I resent that.' [male #4] 'It'’s too damned easy to blame the police for everything.'’ Gentlemen, may I remind you that the purpose of this meeting 'is to attack the problem, not each other.' [male #5] 'Meetings, meetings, all we have is meetings.' [male #3] 'What we are facing here' are certain socio-economic urban inevitability-- Now, you listen to me. You clean up Midtown or I'm going to close up my restaurant. Oh, no. And that's the only inevitability that I can see. And I'm speaking for all the honest businessmen in the district. Right on. [male #3] 'Mr. Monty, the mayor is deeply concerned.' We are the guardians of the greatest city in the greatest country in the world. You missed the salute to the flag. Now, with enlightened participation from the community of this kind, we are certainly moving towards some long range solution. Long range here, we're drowning in-in porno and hookers. Right, and we also have immediate ongoing action to alleviate the problem. You know, Harold, always lands on his feet. Folks, let me be honest with you. The mayor considers this to be a number one priority. 'Midtown is the income producing heart of the city.' 'He wants me to assure everyone of you' that there is nothing more important to him than keeping that heart beating. [applause] Uh.. Yes. Morrison, City magazine. Where is the mayor? Unfortunately, he had to deal with, uh, ahem, excuse me another very critical issue. Like getting re-elected. But he did ask Deputy Inspector Keogh to come here and make a comprehensive report on the progress of operation cleanup. Oh, and here come the marines. Well, now, ladies and gentlemen.. ...the first thing you've got to remember.. ...is that we are dealing with a very big area. Now, I'm talking about over 60 subway platforms. Eleven convention hotels, 300 restaurants and over 700 bars. That takes coverage. We have beefed up our task force with two captains, 11 lieutenants, 54 sergeants 'and over 553 patrolmen.' There are over 1000 street prostitutes in this district. And during the past three months period, we have scored over 1500 loitering arrest. [Fran] 'Never heard so many numbers in all my life.' [Keogh] 'Come on, Morrison.' Well, it makes 'em feel secure. You know, when you're a patrolman pounding a beat you carry a gun. When you're a deputy inspector, you carry statistics. Aren't you carrying the mayor a bit too just a little round the edges? Is that a new hairdo? Okay, no comment. You know, I like the way that piece turned out. The one you did on the porno bookstores, good, very good. Yeah, not good enough. Just the tip of the iceberg, I think. What you're buckin' for, a national journalism award? Isn't everybody? You get the girls off the street you might make commissioner. Not a chance. Every night I've got a station house full of prosts. Next morning, they take a taxi home from court soak their feet, put on fresh eyelashes. By 1:00 o'clock, it's like somebody rang a bell. New game, same players. Sounds like kids playing Ring Lee-me-oh. A thousand prostitutes. Do you have any solutions? Sure, every commuter should take one home. [laughs] Hey, I might like to come down and hang around some night. - Possible? - Sure, why not? How 'bout tonight? We're just in time for the night game. [grunts] [sobbing] [man speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] What'd he use, a cigarette? Well, he's done it before with girls in his stable and he'll do it again. Tell her she'll sign a statement, we can put him in jail for a very long time. I told her. Well, then tell her if she's frightened, we'll give her protection or put her in a, in a hotel with a guard for 24 hours. [speaking in Spanish] Tell her if she doesn't do it, that rat is going to think she talked to us anyway and he's gonna beat the hell out of her. [speaking in Spanish] [female #2] '’So, then she says to me, "What does your pimp do all day?"'’ So, I told her he don't do nothin'. But the way he don't do it is beautiful. [laughter] Hey, hey, you know I think, uh, you girls are really yo-yos. What's the matter, honey? You jealous? [laughter] What'd you do, get a new air pillow? Yeah, the last one come leakin'. That's just like my baby. I can't seem to keep him in diapers. Where you got him now? These people in the Bronx, they're taking care of 'em for me. Hey. Hey, honey. Uh, you think they could get me down to court early tomorrow morning. You know, I got a hair appointment. Oh, what're you gonna do, get a permanent? [laughter] A permanent? [laughter] Ain't nobody had a permanent since 1947. [laughter] - 'Hey, what's goin' on?' - 'Who is that?' [indistinct chatter] Shut up, will you! Shut up. Why don't you ask him what he did to one of his girls? Go ahead and ask him, Mr. Bigshot. Go on and tell them what you did. Little slut, she probably deserved it. Yeah.. [indistinct chatter] [Keogh] 'I'll never understand it.' 'This thing that hookers have for their pimps.' Here's a 14 year old girl with her back burned raw and we can't get her to press charges. Is she just afraid or is it sex or love or status? Or are they looking for their fathers, what? In a pimp? Ha-ha-ha. I don't know, maybe just somebody to be responsible for their lives. Like a lot of women, I guess. [telephone ringing] Look, if I could get the sight of prost's head, I'd have the street cleaned up in 24 hours. [Fran] 'Where're they going now?' [Keogh] 'Oh, we'll lock 'em up in cells for the night.' Listen, I think I'd like to talk to one or two of them. Would that be possible? Yeah, sure it's possible. I don't think you'll learn too much. Swifty? [Swifty] 'Yes, sir.' They're kinda hard to know. Yeah, so is everybody. I wanna sleep by myself. You know, you can't. Two to a cell. I see, when we gonna get married. When you get your shoe fixed. I ain't sleeping with no 9th Avenue chippy. [indistinct chatter] [Watson] 'How about marrying the librarian?' Forget it, she's working the East Side now. What about that runaway? The one with the gimpy foot. Or listen, that, uh, skinny red head. The one that lets everything hang out. What's with this some college girl from Boston? Yeah, she changed her story. Now, her father's a southern senator. They all got some crazy story. 99% of them you can't trust. Hey...how 'bout Wanda? She's okay. 'She's been on the street what, four years.' A dedicated woman. But I don't think she'll go for it. A dedicated woman? What she in for, loitering? No, assault this time. She was telling up a bus full of matinee women on 50th. She slugged the driver. There is nothing a working girl hates more than straight women. Tell her we'll drop the assault charges if she'll talk to Ms. Morrison. I'll try. [hissing] Hello. [male #6] 'People versus Cindy Sand.' 'Counsel waives the reading of rights and charges.' 'How do you plead?' [female #3] 'Not guilty.' I thought she wasn't gonna make it. I'm a resident of New York City, working as a model, Your Honor. [male #7] 'Bail is set at $50.' 'Trial on November 15th. Next case.' People versus Angel Collomb. How do you plead? [female #4] 'I'm not your guilty, Your Honor.' I changed it. Bail is $50. Trial is November.. [indistinct chatter] You go through a damn fool thing like that.. I don't want no one hasslin' me. But you're a pro. You're used to be hassled. [chuckles] Only when I get paid for it. It could mean a 3-400 dollar fine. depending on what side of the bed his Honor got up on this morning. So, I'll make it up. Sweet knows all I need is couple good nights. Sure he knows. The only problem is he hasn't got it. [male #7] 'Fine, $50.' He didn't send the money? Wanda, do I have to explain it? Lately, you've been in more than you're out when you don't work-- It ain't my fault, I-I can't help it if there's a, there's a squeeze and things are tight. You got picked up on assault charge. That's not smart. I give Sweet plenty, 5000 a month last year. Where is it? Now, what kind of talk is that? You know Sweet's got heavy expenses. It's not an easy business. He has to compete. Now, at this stage you better plead guilty and take the time. I ain't going to no Rikers Island. I hate that stinkin' place. Talkin' about a couple of weeks, at the most. Nothing's that bad for a couple of weeks. He's still the same, sitting around at Willie's watching The Knicks on TV. [male #6] 'People versus Wanda Klavic.' What, what kind of a game is he playing with me, anyway? Look, I-I ain't no baby he's got to teach a lesson to. I'm his number one woman, ain't I? When you work. [male #6] 'Defendant is charged with assault' 'of the third degree and that she' 'did strike the complainant Theodore Medina about the face' 'causing him to sustain an injury' 'which necessitated that he be treated' 'at Roosevelt Hospital. How do you plead?' 'Guilty, your honor.' You know you've got 27 direct prostitution arrests in the past four years. So now you're going on bigger things, eh? You have anything to say? The creep pushed me first. $500 or 60 days. It'll be all over before you know it. Glad to see some justice in the court. Drop dead. [male #6] 'People versus Sherry Dubois.' 'How do you plead?' [indistinct chatter] I ain't got it. Excuse me, Adam's Department of Social Services. I've been authorized to pay the fine for Wanda Klavic. What're you talking about? What's goin' on here? 'You'll find out when you get outside.' Oh. I didn't mean to make such a mystery out of it. Frankly I wasn't even sure you'd take it. I don't get it. What's in it for you? What do you want with me anyway? - Thank you very much. - Good luck. Can we have a cup of coffee? Coffee? Coffee, um.. I gotta get back to work. Listen, uh, I'm into you for 500. You might as well give me another five for the cab, right? Here, write down your address, will you? I don't like owin' anybody. I'll pay it all back in a couple of weeks. - I'm in no hurry. - Yeah, but I am. Alright, what's going on here? Look, I know nobody does anything for nothin', right? That's right. I wanna make a business deal with you. I wanna, I wanna talk to you. You know, about working girls. Know. What? Anything, everything, whatever you can tell me. And times worth money, I mean, yours and mine. So.. So if we can talk then, uh.. Then I'll pay you. Whatever we can work out, pay by the hour. It could take care of the fine. Why me? Well because Swifty says.. ...you're a dedicated woman. Oh, ha, ha! You don't even know what that means, do you? No, not exactly, but, uh.. - It sounds-- - It sounds nice. Something you can handle like a white nigger, right? A dedicated woman don't roll a John and she don't steal. But I'm a whore when I sell it for money. Just like you sell for a marriage license or fancy dinner. Hey, you want a ride uptown? Hey, how about my offer? I gotta think about it. We're going up to 59th street. Drop me off at 45th, okay? - 'Okay.' - How do I know? [Lester] 'What besides the powder sugar and ten gallons of gas' can possibly be worth 500 dollars. Would you believe integrity? - Oh, integrity. - Yes. A commodity in very short supply. Come on, friend, get off the soapbox. - Integrity from a hustler? - Well, why not? You know what she said to Inspector Keogh when he offered to exchange her privacy for an out on an assault rap? - Please. - Huh. I, forgot. You don't like women to swear. Or smoke cigars. Sue me. But she's willing to spill her all to you for hard cash, huh? You know what I think, Morrison? I think she's got a good head for business. Lester, there is something special here. I know it. How special can a piece on prostitution be? It's cheap. It's easy. Every magazine in the city has one. You titillate a little, you exploit.. That is not what we're about. I know that. But, Lester.. ...there is no woman alive who wasn't had the fantasy of going into a room with a stranger and selling herself for money. Or the nightmare. I look at that girl and I wonder what separates us? Desperation. Or guts? Maybe just a case of VD. [chuckles] Uh, you always did have a lot of class. Besides we just ran that big spread last month on the new black middle class. I don't wanna follow it with this. Well, what makes you to think this scene is black? Would you be surprised to hear that the majority of the girls on the street are white. 'From Midwest cities, the school dropouts..' all come here to be models find a rich man, same old dream. [sighs] Anyway, I don't even know whether she's gonna talk to me or not. But if she does and you're chicken I'll pick up the tab myself. Okay, okay. Talk about hustling. [Orin] 'You mean it's still around?' With all those singles bars and liberated females with waterbeds. Nobody has to pay for it anymore. - But they want to. - What do you mean they want to? Well, I think a lot of men are scared to death of the free giveaway. And with a prostitute, they can play it safe. No, risk, no demand, no intimacy. Right this way. Women's lib may be the biggest boon to prostitution since the invention of the twin bed. [laugh] Can I quote you at the athletic club? Your table will be ready in just a moment, Mr. Dietrich. And I'll personally take care of your lounge chair. Thank you. Take tonight, for instance. It's so complicated. You're gonna take me to bed, right? But first you have to feed me at a very expensive restaurant because it makes you feel better. True, but it makes you feel better too. Such as it may be.. It's your worth. Now what would you say if I told you you're in solid agreement with an 8th Avenue hooker. I'd say it calls for two martinis. And this girl Wanda she says that under all the romance and the orange blossoms and all that.. ...that men and women engage in business transactions all the time. That's a pretty profound thought for a hooker.. ...or for anybody. It just leaves out a couple of things. Like what? Respect, mutual need.. ...love. The hell with dinner. Let's go home. - We've got company. - Hmm? Too late. They've got our names on them. 'Uh, fine.' You've been with a prostitute, right? Haven't we exhausted this subject? Oh, come on, all you Princeton boys must have to had to pass your masculinity exams at the local brothel. You're a terrier, why can't you ever do a nice in-depth piece on The Lennon Sisters or needle point. The Lennon Sisters are needle point. You should know by now I refused to be a statistic in your articles. Excuse me, Ms. Morrison, a telephone call. - You may take it right way. - Thank you. Sorry. Hello! 'Ms. Morrison, this is Vincent Cleno.' 'Your exchange gave me the number.' - Cleno? - 'Swifty.' Oh, Swifty, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize the name. 'Yeah, nobody does. Look, I saw Wanda today' 'and she asked me tell you she'll meet you tomorrow' 'at 2:00 o'clock.' Oh! Oh, where? [Swifty] 'Where do you want?' [Fran] 'Tell her the, uh.. the-the Copper Kettle' the one just of 6th. 'Oh, yeah, okay.' 'Uh, look, I'm really glad' 'you paid her fine, but her pimp won't be.' [Fran] 'Well, why not, I'm saving him money.' [Swifty] 'Yeah, but your poaching' 'on his territory, he's not gonna like that.' [Fran] 'Oh, well, Wanda looks like a girl' 'who can take care of herself.' Oh, I'm meetin' someone. Is that okay? Are those little owls? Um, real agate. Got 'em at a Japanese store up on Broadway. Anything with a owl or elephant supposed to be good luck. You're superstitious. If I was, I wouldn't be here. Third Thursday of the month is one of the most unlucky day. Well, maybe we could break the jinx. Listen.. Let's get the money straighten up right now, okay? That's a first thing a working girl does. So you don't have no hassles later. Right. What'd you have in mind? Well, talking like this, I mean, knowin' it's gonna be printed up and everything. 'The majority of girls they might take advantage of you.' 'You know, they figure..' 'Say what could you get on the street' 'things are going good you got..' ...four-five tricks in an hour you'd make 100, 150 dollars. But, uh.. [chuckles] Oh, I'm taking into consideration that money is hard, right? It's hard everywhere. So, uh, if you could afford it, I would charge you.. ...$50 an hour. Sounds fair. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I beg your pardon. The restaurant reserves the right to refuse service to anyone. Well, I'd like to know the reason. I think the reason is obvious. I'd like to hear it. I don't want to create a scene. 'Now, if you just go quietly.' Look, I'm Fran Morrison from City Magazine and this is a friend of mine, now are you really telling me 'that we're not welcome here?' I'm very sorry, Ms. Morrison but the restaurant has a very firm policy. 'We have to think of our customers.' What's the matter? Afraid they'll catch somethin'? You don't get it off the plates. It's a rip-off anyway. [chuckles] Two and a quarter for a lousy 'horse meat hamburger.' We should have stayed in there and fought that out. Yeah, right. You kiddin' me? Just payin' off my last fight. Why am I so curious and you're so calm? I ain't calm. Oh! Just used to it, you ain't. Yeah, but I mean doesn't it bug you being treated like that? Yeah, right, what are you gonna do? Sometimes you fight, sometimes you swallow it down. Anyway, you just got your first lesson in the world of the straights. Bunch of friggin' hypocrites. You wanna know something? This guy, he owns all these Copper Kettles same creep owns the Mona Lisa, you believe it? What's the Mona Lisa? Oh, it's this, uh.. You know, this hotel, where most of the West Side girls work. Hey, wait a second, how do you know that? Larry Gustavino, he's a manager. He told me. - 'You're sure about that?' - 'About what?' [Fran] 'About that, uh, guy, who, uh, owns the hotel.' Larry's a lot of things, you know? Ain't no liar. You can ask him yourself. Couple of ginger ales, please. What's that, dollar and a half, right? There you go. - Oh, I see you like ketchup. - Yeah. Eat on the county. Put on everything I'm telling you. What county? Uh, Cuyahoga just outside Cleveland. I grew up around lakes, you believe it this is the only water I see in this place. Is that where your family is? Yeah. What's left of it. My brother.. ...he still works for the mill there, you know. My.. ...my sister.. ...and my mother, they died in a fire. My father, he'll never know where he is, I'm.. Reporter's best tool. That way, uh, you get everything down right and you don't have to, uh, rely on your memory. Gonna bother you? I don't know. I ain't never done this before. Well.. ...just forget it's there. Listen, if it's gonna bother you, I-I can do it without it-- No, no. This is business, like a trick. You paid for it you got a right to have it the way you want it, right? Oh, that's a silly question. Asking a prostitute, why she does it? Well, I make my living asking silly questions. What do you make a year? Unless it's private or somethin'. Well, I make, uh, 20 sometimes 25,000 Oh, yeah? That's pretty good. First year, I-I was out on the street I made 70. - Thousand? - Yeah, thousand. Before that I had a waitress job Nine to five, six days a week. Fifty-two fifty take home, including tips. So that's why it's a silly question. Well, I got another silly question. The other day, you didn't have enough to pay your fine. So where is it, all your money? You give it to somebody? You give it to your pimp? [siren wailing] That's my business. I gotta go to work. Can we meet tomorrow? I don't know. What time will be good for you? I'll let you know. May...maybe this whole thing ain't such a good idea. - What? - This deal we made. We talk and stuff. It-it-it ain't my stuff. But why not, it's everybody's stuff. You're smart, you got opinions. Now, what time-- Yeah, a smart girl. You know, don't go off her beat. On 8th Avenue, I know what to expect. I don't, I don't get no flack from nobody. Right, except when you're in the bullpen or in court.. '...or on Rikers Island.' Listen, man, I didn't come lookin' for you. You'll get your 500 back-- I don't give a damn about the money-- Yeah, well, I do! I do! I guess there's something else we should have straightened out up front. I'm not in this to...trap you.. ...insult you. But I'm not gonna pussyfoot around or walk on eggshells. That's not my beat. I have to feel free to ask you whatever I want.. ...say whatever I think.. ...and you can answer or not answer or you can tell me to go to hell anytime. If you don't agree on that, then you're right. We better call it quits. No, uh.. You should have had that, that thing turned on when that joker was talking the last time. [tape rewinding] - 'They're our customers.' - What's the matter? 'Afraid they'll catch something? You don't get it off the..' This is what I sound like? 'It's a rip-off anyway.' [instrumental music] [male #8] 'Hey, Wanda.' 'Hey, babe, wait a minute.' How you doing, mama? Hear-tell you left Sweet. News travels fast in the streets, you know. Sweet, he don't know how to take care of no woman, no how. So why don't you get yourself a real man. You know where I can find one? [music continues] - Hey, there. - Hey. What're you doing here on my corner, huh? You don't own the corner. Yeah, right. I've been here for three years you know, everybody knows that. My-my-my regulars, everybody. Well, I don't know it. Yeah? [grunting] [Wanda] 'You want more, huh?' 'You want more?' You don't scare us. Yeah, you get lost. Get off of this corner! Get your face off this corner! Oh, you oughta know better than to be steppin' on somebody else's corner. Hey, Wanda, they said they'd beat me up. Oh, you can't let every dumb slut scare you with that kind of talk you ain't gonna last a month. They're only testin' to see how you're going to do without protection? I sure hope you know what you're doing 'cause the word is out.. ...that you have left Sweet. Don't anybody have work around here? All they do is gossip. They say some big-shot dyke. That's all they know. Happens she's a writer, you know for one of them magazines. She's paying me just to talk to her. Talk to her? About what? Anything I want. Fifty bucks an hour. Woo-wee! Now I've heard of some freaks. Well, I'm gettin' back on my corner before those hustlers think they can take over my beat. I wish I could luck out like that. Fifty an hour without flat-backing. Mm, I ain't even collected one yet today. And you know.. You know that place in the Bronx they keep my baby for me. They say everything's goin' up and they need more money. Sweet says that means I gotta make more. Forget it, he can.. He can spring for another 30 bucks without starving to death. So he don't get his custom Continental this year. He's in a real bad mood, I think it's 'cause you haven't called him. Let him call me. Are you kidding, Wanda? He can't do that. How would it look for him to go runnin' after one of his girls, huh? Everybody'd be laughing at him. - You know he's got his pride. - No, I don't give a damn. I'll call him when I'm good and ready, maybe never, huh? You better not say things like that to anybody who-- Oh, what if it does. Come on. Don't do it, Wanda. You know Sweet cares about you. Yeah. He don't act like it. You're his number one woman. If he cares so much he wouldn't have me going up that stinkin' hellhole the stinkin' Rikers. Hey, how 'bout it? Go home and get a haircut. Tell your mother to give you a decent shirt. Hey, look, I got the money. You got 100 dollars? Ooh, yeah, 100 dollars. Come on, is she spaced out on something or what? Wanda, are you kiddin'? - You better not undercut me. - He had the 30. You gotta teach men not to disrespect you, pimps included. He's gonna go real hard on me if I don't make my quota tonight. Are you busy? It's, uh, twenty and ten. Well, I'll see you later. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Uh, how 'bout two girls? It's fifty. You only pay once for the room. Forty? You want bargains try 14th street. Hey, Wanda, please. Okay. Come on. [Gustavino] 'Sixteen towels missing this week, fourteen last week.' I'm not gonna stand here and count towels. I've got a business to run here. [indistinct chatter] Seems like Larry don't care who he lets in this place. Get outta here. [bell dings] Alright! Chooch, room number 15. Ten bucks, Mike. If you wanna know? I think she's trying to move into your spot with Sweet. Ah, what would he want with a dog like that. Hey, hey! You better register Mr. and Mrs. What? Who's countin'? I see her sniffin' around Sweet over at Willie's coming on cute. Yeah, cute like a cobra. Who's she with anyway? Uh, it's 30, honey, remember? Big George. She's telling everyone she makes 450 a night. - Four fifty? - Or is it fifty full. - I don't what-- - She is a damn liar. I'm telling you, she ain't makin' no 450. Not with all this heat on. Oh, honey, if you worry about your wallet 'just put it in your pants and lay your head on it.' [Dee Dee] 'Maybe she's working massage parlors there.' [Wanda] 'Yeah.' Parking lots and hallways that's more her scene. If anything, she's making a real presence. No, no, kissy-kissy, honey. [Dee Dee] 'Like I'm sayin', it's just what I hear.' [Wanda] '’And that's one of the oldest lies in the world..'’ Uh, wait. 'I don't know if he is or not.' 'I just know she's tryin'.' [Wanda] 'Then I'll tell ya, he's not so smart as he makes out to be.' Hey...what about me? [Wanda] 'I'm getting to you, honey.' 'Sweet.' 'Yeah, all this fuss about Sweet.' What is he, anyway? He's just a man. [instrumental music] Hey, Wanda, come here. Forget it, I lost ten bucks here last week in your lousy pecorino. [male #9] 'No. no, no, for real.' There's somebody inside who wants to see you. [music continues] Hello, Wanda. What's the matter, we've always been friends, haven't we? It's alright, don't be mad. 'I've got good news.' Five Cs for you. - How come? - You know how I feel about you. There's no one like Wanda, I always tell Sweet. 'I don't like to see you two love birds on the out' so, I said to him let me advanced you the 500. I know she's good for it. That's nice, boss. That's real nice. Just one thing. He doesn't want you talkin' to any reporter. That-that's crazy. I didn't tell her anything about-about him or, or business like that, you know, just, uh.. ...stuff that couldn't hurt nobody. You don't know what could hurt. What's he think, I'm some dummy? I can't even open my mouth? No. I ain't stupid. Wanda, do like he says, huh. 'Use your head.' Take the 500 and stop the talking. Stuff it. [car horn honking] [tires screeching] [Wanda] 'Stop. Stop right here.' 'Hey.' Hey, Dee Dee. 'Dee Dee? Is that you? Come here!' I almost didn't recognize you. I'm trying this little girl look. The men really go for it. Probably nothing's gonna help tonight. Come on, come on, I've got Fran here the writer I told you about. I'm going over to show her the stroll on Lex, you wanna come? I don't think I oughta go, really. Oh-oh, come on. Come on! I guess there's no tricks in the rain anyway. Oh, Fran, this is Dee Dee. - Hi. - Hi. [Dee Dee] 'Hey, ain't that Giselle.' 'Giselle! What's up?' We're going over to Lexington Avenue. Come on. 'Oh, why not, everybody's keepin' in' 'for a drier tonight.' 'Sweet was just here. Boy was he mad.' 'I only had 40 to give him.' 'What's he want on a night like this!' If it clears up, I guess I can work late, you know? I tried Lex once with the vice squad. You know the 17th, they're the worst. Oh! - What is that? - Oh, it's a tape recorder. - I always use it-- - Yeah, all writers use it. You know, when they wanna get straight. Not just make it up like they-they thought it was. Uh-huh, that's groovy. Oh, look, uh, there's Mona Lisa Hotel I was tellin' you about. Uh, slow down, will you. 'Stop!' Uh, you see up there? Uh, that window? That reflector, that's where Larry sits. That way he can, uh, he can see the-the cop cars when they come around the corner, whoo, gets the girls right in. - You're kidding? - And that's St. Sebastian. They call it the Midtown Chapel. He takes them close to the hotel. Yeah, the priest there, he's always giving Larry the business. Callin' the cops, raise the roof. You can go now, cabbie. But the priest, he ain't against the girls, though. When I see the van comin', I always duck in and he says "Hey, gal, wanna pray?" And I say, "Sure." He knows I'm waitin' till the cops to go by. And now, over here, now this, this is where we hide out when we're runnin' from the van. Yeah. What, you mean that big building? - 'Yeah, I know.' - 'Slow down, slow down.' [Wanda] 'Slow down, slow-slow down.' Yeah, and I found this place right.. You see over there behind that big piling? 'Yeah, well, they got some kind of fire stairs.' And we can up three, four stories. - And nobody can ever find us. - That's terrific. Yeah, listen, are we gonna go across town or ain't we? Hey, we're sight seeing, okay? Yeah, so charter a bus. What are buggin' us for? It's right there on the meter. [tires screeching] Freak. Hey, it stopped rainin'. Maybe we oughta go back. - I'm going back. - Where you goin'? [indistinct chattering] This is my old turf. Right here, right here on this corner I was turned out four years ago. Oh, I-I used to know everybody, I knew I knew the cops, I knew, uh, the girls. I knew the counterman. Hi, how you doin'? I like the action better on 8th Avenue. Yeah, well, it's different here. It' a little more high class, right. Do you ever think about quitting? Oh, quittin'? Everybody's got a goal. What kind of a goal? Well, most girls, they want to save two or three grand by a certain age. - Put it down on a business. - Yeah. - Like a restaurant or a club. - Or a boutique. I know some girls, they figure on stayin' all their life. Yeah, like they're born to it. Ain't nobody born to it, stupid. You were no different from Fran here. Or Jackie Kennedy. Or anybody. [tires screeching] Alright, come on, girls. Let's go. Let's go. I don't know what you mean, officer. - What? - You got any identification? Oh, yes, officer, I'm a writer and these women are helping me on a research project so.. - On a what? - A research project. Then you girls know this is a well-known area for prostitutes. Ain't that shocking? It looks like I've left my press card at home. But if you just let me make a call to my office they'll explain everything to you. Well, I'll tell you what, you make all the calls you want down at the precinct, alright. [indistinct chattering] But this is ridiculous, you can't even walk on a street. I can assure you Inspector Keogh will not be happy-- Keogh, huh, no kidding, how's the mayor gonna feel? Alright, come on girls, let's go, make some room. Come on, I got company for you. Come on. [indistinct chatter] Hey, honey! What you doin' over here on Lex? - Mouth. - Ah-ah. Yeah, right. This is a research project, officer. Ooh, what, this is shocking, officer, what do you mean? [instrumental music] - Let's go, come on. - Stop shovin'. - Come on. - 'What is this, some joke?' If it is, it isn't funny. I told him. Him. I told him we were on a research project. Noviello, what are you doing? Well, what the hell's with this research project? What's a research project? Noviello, this is Ms. Morrison. She's a writer. What's the matter with you? Alright, so I was wrong about her. But the rest of them are just plain prosts, right? What the hell difference does that make? They weren't working. I can swear to that. Now, what business do you cops have picking them up when they're not working? It's a violation of their constitutional rights. [girls cheering] Hey, you should have seen the look on that boy scout.. You know how many times I've been been busted for loitering. I ain't kiddin' you. Fifteen hundred times. This the first time I ever walked out of that place like that. Oh. Oh, I'm tellin' you, you should have hired her. Oh, well, it doesn't hurt to have clout. Oh, it ain't clout, honey. It is brains. She knows more than all them uniformed clowns put together. [laughing] What business you got.. ...pickin' up girls when they ain't workin'. Don't you bummers know, it's against their constitutional rights! [laughing] Hey, is this.. - What? - Well, you know. Against our rights? Well, yes. It violates the 14th amendment. How the hell does that go again? Well, um, the 14th amendment says that the.. ...the police can't arbitrarily or capriciously, you know what I mean? Um, deprive you of your life or liberty without what's called due process of law. And it guarantees you, you know, um 'e-equal protection under the law.' Uh, in other words all that means is that no group of people, say, blacks, homosexuals prostitutes, whatever can be arrested and treated differently just because they're members of that group. That's all. I'll be damned. How come I got to be 22 years old and nobody ever told me none of that? How the hell come? There's nothing wrong with the constitution, honey but who has got time to read it? [Wanda] 'Hey, wait, where's Dee Dee?' She's over there, there she is. Hey! Dee Dee! What you doin' over there all by yourself? I wanna go back to work? Oh, come on, will ya. Being such a damn kill joy. Something the matter? - Yeah. Don't you feel good? - Yeah. Hey, you missed out on the constitutional. Oh, what's the matter, are you mad? 'Cause they yelled at you? I was thinkin' about my baby. He'll be a year old next month. Recognizes me now when I come visit. What's his name? Uh, she cries if we ask what time it is. His name is Stacey. I didn't even crack 50 tonight. What am I gonna tell, Sweet? Well, you called him from the precinct, didn't you? Tell him, tell him they kept you in all night. He'll know I'm lyin'. He always knows. He'll give me a beating. Why do you let him? - 'Cause he's right. - He's right? To beat you? Sure. And I know he loves me. It's when I make my quota, he's so nice to me. He buys me a peek-a-boo blouse. 'Well, the whipping's for my own good.' 'Cause I'm-I'm lazy. I wouldn't work if it wasn't for him. I wouldn't be worth nothin', would I, Wanda? You make me sick. Stop bawling like some dumb baby. Oh, don't be goin' off on her, Wan? Alright, things ain't like they was when you and I first started out years ago. I mean, uh, it was enjoyable. You could work...easy. Or you could work a little bit. You know, save some money and, uh, you could have a good time. 'But now, they got animals out there on the street.' Things have gone mean and you gotta have a man that looks after you. 'A woman can't do it by her own self.' [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [grunting] [screaming] [music continues] [screaming] [groaning] [female #5] 'Are you kiddin' me?' 'Let's see what's she got in her booty bag.' [grunting] Holding out on us, huh? [grunting] [phone ringing] - 'Yeah.' - Sw-sweet. I just got beat up. They took my money. They cut my face. I don't know what to do. Can I come back to you? I need you, Sweet. [Sweet over phone] 'Sure, you can come back.' 'Sweet's here.' 'Don't he always give you what you need?' 'Don't he always take care of you, baby?' How am I gonna get there? I hurt. I can't hardly walk. 'Crawl.' [beeping] [Fran] I don't understand it. I got this in the mail from Wanda this morning. A note figuring out how much she owes me and four $20 bills. 'Now, what's it mean?' She got mugged a couple of nights ago. Nobody made out any official report but it's all over the street. No, wh-where? How? Outside her place. They got something new now. It's gangs of call girls. You know what they do? They rob and cut them up, it's easier that way. They don't have to flat-back and the payoff's much bigger. 'They don't work as hard.' I'll tell you, they must have given her a hell of a goin' over. Hmm, when women get rough, they're worse than men. Anyway she's gone back to her pimp now. Back to her pimp? Hey, home is where your pimp is. She could've called me. I have helped her. How? You're a square. No matter how hard you try you're on the outside. Oh, I don't believe that. We had a relationship, I-I-I know it meant something. Only to a point. Compete with a pimp, you're gonna lose. I got no proof, but I'd lay odds he fingered her for that gang. I mean a working girl can't get too independent. I might be catching. You know what I'm tellin' you? Do you think Wanda knows that? 'Of course.' Then how can she go back to him? How can she not go back? What has she got a choice? Hey, Swifty. Come on, let's go. I'm sorry, I gotta go. Isn't there something, anything I can do? Yeah, do her a favor, leave her alone. [Fran] I feel so helpless and I hate it. Yeah, I know. You like to be in control. That was a favorite phrase of my ex husband's. He could make it sound like a communicable disease. I'm sorry. He always resented it. Do you? In theory, no. I'm that 20th century mutation. An enlightened male. In practice? There's some kind of reflex. Way, deep down in my unconscious. - Gulp. - Yeah, gulp. Oh, God. Change takes such a long time, doesn't it? Listen. Don't beat yourself. Don't be such a bleeding heart for the exploited of the world. Including your prostitutes. Orin, they are not my prostitutes. They're women with names and faces and...knowing someone is a responsibility. You can't just walk away from it. Is it that or is it just a good story you can't-- Oh, no, that's a lousy thing to say. - I didn't mean it that way. - It's about exploiting, then-- Uh, who said exploit, but you reporters have a way-- And I hate sentences that start with "You reporters." I don't have to apologize-- Fran, will you stop and listen? You're writing about fact, not fiction. That girl is whatever the hell she is. You have to accept it. You can't rewrite her the way you want her to be. You sound like you hate her. I don't hate her. I just don't wanna live with her. I don't want her in bed with you and me. [car horn honking] Hey, Chooch, hit the buzzer! [buzzer buzzing] - Mr. Gustavino? - Come in. Thank you for seeing me. Told you on the phone I ain't afraid to talk to a reporter. I got nothin' to hide. Oh, I see, uh, business is good. Yeah. Well, no complaints. What is it you wanna know? Uh, well, first of all.. ...let me make sure I've got your name spelt right. It's, uh, G-U-A-S-T-A? - The rest is vino, like wine. - Alright. Who was that said, "I don't care what you say about me as long as you spell my name right?" I don't know. Right. I wanna know about the hotel. You got 32 rooms? Fourteen welfare and the rest transient. 'And last year you scored 74 prostitution arrests' 'and 29 convictions.' Where'd you get those figures? From the police file. You sure this ain't some kind of scandal sheet you writing for? No, it's a very reputable.. Here, look. I'll give you a copy. Here you go. See, what I'm doing is a piece on Midtown so, naturally, uh prostitution is a part of that. Hmm. Look, you wanna find out what it's all about.. ...why don't you rent a room for a couple of hours and give it a try. I'm afraid that might violate my professional standards. What do you mean? Everybody here's professionals. But in this field I'd-I'd be an amateur. The only difference between amateurs and professionals is the money. Get back! [buzzer buzzing] Anybody who wants to rent the room here all you gotta do is have ten bucks as long as they're not lookin' to rob anybody it ain't my responsibility. You didn't find any robbery arrests on that sheet, did you? How much does the hotel gross in a week? I don't keep the books. We pay our taxes like any other business. Bar, a shoe store. Who's we? Okay! [car horn honking] Do you own the hotel? I'm just the manager. Well, who is the owner? Some corporation. Does it have a name? Well, now, somebody pays your salary. Told you before, I make it a point not to mind nobody else's business. Live and let live is my motto. Sure we make a little money off the girls. So do the big hotels. 'So do the politicians.' And the police, they do okay too. On overtime, you know what it costs the tax payers to keep the hookers off the streets? Plenty. [Dee Dee screaming] I'm gonna give her to ten and I want it back. - Give what back? - She's got my pinky ring. 'She saw the diamond, she took it.' [Gustavino] 'Put the knife down.' Now, look. Don't come any closer. I lost a little weight and it slipped off my finger. No one gets rolled in this hotel-- Are you kiddin'? I know you're workin' together. Give me back that ring. Give it back. Hey, come on, there's a cop down on the corner. 'If you don't put that thing down in one second' 'I'm gonna go bring him up' 'he's gonna book you for assault.' 'You'll be in all the papers tomorrow.' Come on. Put it down. You, pig, come on. Come on! Get out. Leave your address, if I find your ring, I'll send it. Wait a minute, let me get my shoes. - Come on, get up! - Wait a minute! Freak! - Where is it? - I-I ain't seen it. - I don't know. - Tell me! [screaming] [Gustavino] 'You're not talking to a dummy trick.' Give it to me. I didn't take it. It just-- Get outta here. Get your clothes on and get outta here. Get out of this hotel. Don't come back. Don't go to any hotel I have anything to do with! I'm warnin' ya! 'Two pieces of glass, anyway.' [dramatic music] [honking] Dee Dee! Hey, Dee Dee, wait a minute! [Fran] The girls won't talk to me. I think the pimps must have got to them. - 'You sound surprised.' - I don't know what I am. This is one business that doesn't relish publicity. I'm beginning to understand why. You know what they take in at the Mona Lisa in an average week? I figured it out on the way over here. - Twenty thousand dollars. - Well, I'll match that. You take 200,000 prostitutes in the United States today. And the lowest estimate, six transactions a day. And the lowest figure, twenty dollars. And you come up with around seven billion dollars year. That is ten times the budget of the Justice Department. - I just don't get it! - Get what? Oh, the whole logic of law enforcement. You don't arrest the pimps, you don't arrest the johns you don't touch the owners of these fleabag hotels but you're gonna beat this monolith by busting Wanda and Dee Dee and forty other girls a night and tossing them in the bullpen. If you wanted to stop illegal racetrack gambling would you put the racehorses in jail? [laughing] Whoever said anything about logic? Oh, it's ridiculous. It's obscene. 'Oh, now, hold it up, lady!' I'm just a cop, I do what I'm told! The rest I leave up to City Hall and the courts. I've heard that one before. Gustavino's only the manager. It ain't my responsibility. They oughta grind up lapel buttons and hand 'em out to everybody. You know, Fran, everybody's got a dream. I've got two. The first is, I stretch a big net across the Holland Tunnel on the Jersey side. That way, I scoop up half the johns in New York City in one fell swoop. The other, I run a big magnet of the streets of midtown Manhattan. And all the guns come flying out of hip pockets and subway gratings. What are you trying to say? That doing something about this is just a pipe dream? Hey, Morrison, what happened to your sense of humor? - I'm on your side! - I'm not so sure. What are you bein' so damn righteous about? I've been playin' this game of tag since you were in kindergarten! I've been through a dozen administrations And a dozen clean ups! And every time I broke my tail tryin' to buck this system! Well, after a while, you learn! You don't break your heart. Sorry. 'What do you want, Gustavino's head on a platter?' Nah, he's just a minnow. You could swallow him in one bite. Somebody's getting very rich out of all this. A lot of somebodies. I wanna know who they are. You're openin' up a very big can of beans, lady. I like beans. [telephone ringing] This is a list of all the prost hotels and the massage parlors in the district. For the owners' names you're gonna have to dig. You're gonna run into dummy corporations inside other dummy corporations. You gonna find property held in employers' names and secretaries' names, and dogs' and cats' names. 'But if you ever get past all that' 'you're gonna find some names that'll surprise' 'the hell outta you.' But I don't think you'll ever touch 'em. That's not the way the game is played. 'But if you do.' 'If you and your magazine come up with some ammunition' 'I'll use it.' But in the meantime.. ...do you mind if I keep on polishing my magnet? Hey! How's it goin'? Uh, well, one baby step after another. - Hey, have you seen Wanda? - Yeah. - How is she? - She's okay. I took your advice. I haven't tried to see her. She, uh, back working? She never stopped. There's no sick leave on the street. Next time you see her, could you tell her somethin' for me? She's upstairs in the bullpen now. The van picked her up in some parkin' lot. In the backseat of a car with a drunk. Oh, God. I know. He's pushing her very hard. Swifty, isn't there some way I can talk to her? Just for a few minutes, there's.. ...there's something I'd-I'd like her to know. [Swifty] Hey, I don't think she'll come if she knows you're here to tell you the truth. [Fran] Then don't tell her. [intense music] - Hello, Wanda. - Uh, hi. 'I asked Swifty to send you down.' I, uh...I got your note, and the money. - Thanks. - Uh, well, it's okay. Look, um.. ...I'm sorry we can't talk anymore. But, um.. 'there's somethin' I wanted you to know.' You gave me something very important for my article. You gave me, um, yourself. [instrumental music] For 120 bucks, that's a bargain. Look, I don't wanna do anything to hurt you. So is there anything you've told me you don't want me to use? [music continues] Write whatever you want. You paid for it. [Harold over phone] 'I can't do it. I can't give out anything like that.' But there is such a list. 'We have a record of the owners' 'of some of those properties, yes' 'But it's classified.' But why? We're not talkin' about anything criminal! Or are we? I wanna go on record that I didn't introduce that word. Well, then, why can't I get anybody in city government to talk about it? I made a dozen calls in the last hour-- Well, maybe there's a question of civil liberties here. I mean, you can't go around publishing the names of the owners of any of these establishments. Okay, then. How about if I'm willing to take that chance? You can do that, of course. And so can your magazine. But I can't be party to it. I mean, the mayor has certain considerations. Yeah, like, uh, not stepping on any big toes? I resent that. Now, Harold, don't get defensive. I'm not defensive, I'm offended. There's a big difference. Harold...you're a very dedicated public servant. Well, I certainly try to be. I think you're doing a very responsible job in a tough situation. I intend to make a point of that. Thank you. I'm not gonna press you for your list, but, uh.. ...say I wanted to do a little digging of my own and I need a few shortcuts. Any suggestions? Go to the register's office.. ...they can tell you who owns the land under any building in the city. - That's rooms 2-0-6. - 2-0-6. Only remember to ask for a certificate of incorporation. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Certificate of incor.. Huh? Uh, the certificate, uh, it's the only way you can tell if one corporation is owned by another corporation. Well, what about the buildings? That's a little harder. You gotta go down to Nassau Street.. ...then you have to buy copies of "The Standard Abstract Guides to Commercial Properties." 'And I hope that you have a very good expense account' 'because they cost almost as much as they weigh.' [intense music] [Lester] 'Are you kidding with these vouchers? They're astronomical.' So is the story. - 'Fran, I don't think an--' - See, in two parts. The girls on the street, and then the whole, long line of parasites that make money off their backs. Starting with the pimps, and ending with the landlords. Now, here's just a partial list of the owners of the buildings and the properties. [whistles] Have you checked this all out? Uh, every name comes out of the records. Every bank, every insurance company. That's a Park Avenue doctor. That is a charity organization and that, is the lawyer who fronts for the mob in the peepshow rackets. And that one.. ...that's the widow of a Supreme Court judge. This is mind-blowing stuff. Lester...I'm not naive. And I know there are gonna be pressures, all kinds. Now, am I just spinning my wheels or you gonna have the guts to use it? [telephone buzzing] Traube. Uh, it's for you. Hello? Oh, Orin, I'm.. No, no, it's alright, it's alright. Uh.. Oh, is that tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all about it, I.. No, I-I, um, I don't really feel up to a party 'and besides, I wanna work.' Why don't you just go on by yourself? [scoffs] Makes Jill a dull girl, yeah. Uh-uh, well, look, if I, um if I change my mind, I'll-I'll get back to you, okay? Yeah. Bye, darling. Well? 'You didn't answer.' You wanna know if I would use that? Yes. But...we've got lawyers. And you know what they're gonna say? 'They're gonna say we're a small magazine.' We haven't got a million dollars for lawsuits. Oh, my God! 'And don't tell me you're gonna pay for it, either.' Fran, take my advice. - Go to that party tonight. - What does that mean? Lester, you're gonna let this thing go down the drain? Means you better let me handle this! Look, just take the evening and...relax. Get drunk or something. Come on. - Lester-- - Come on, come on. Hey, get away from this! Now, go on. [Nast] Orin tells me you're doing a story on prostitutes. - Yes, I am. - Whoo, whoo. Well, you must be having a ball! Are sure you can't use a little help with the research? Oh, yes, he's much too heavy for you. - No! - Come, my darling. - It's time for a toast. - I'm in great shape. What's a 25th anniversary without a toast? [indistinct chatter] They, uh.. ...and they say marriage is like a feast. Where the grace...is sometimes better than the dinner. [laughing] To Ethel and Harlan, who've shown us you can dine well and richly for twenty five years. With just occasionally a little touch of indigestion. No, it's not urgent. Just tell Lester that if he has any word for me. Uh, he'll know what that means. Just tell him that I'll be home all day tomorrow, okay? Thank you. You know, real tough little broad. Hey, this will be especially interesting to you. This prosti comes up to these friends of mine. And she says to him, "Wanna have a little party?" And right in front of his wife. So she up and says, "My husband doesn't need a prostitute." And the girl looks up at her and says "Well, then, how 'bout you?" Oh, Sid, you know you made that up. No! 'Well, now, isn't it true? Most of them are AC/DC..' I'm really not an expect. Ah, listen, I promised Fran that I'd take her away from all that talk. You can't get away from it anymore. It's under your noses, you see it everywhere. Ooh, I don't know. Not in any of my restaurants, you don't. Orin. Does he have anything to do with the Corporate Kettles? Yeah. And that's just a drop in the bucket. Our boy, Harlan Nast is into everything. And right now, I'm doing a hundred acre industrial complex for him across the river. Yes, it is flaunted in the streets. But I suppose that's the price you have to pay for living in a permissive society. I guess you'd call me an anachronism. 'An old-fashioned man with old-fashioned morals.' Excuse me, dad. I'm afraid we're gonna have to say goodnight. Already? Yes, it's way past Melissa's bedtime. - 'Goodnight, Melissa.' - 'Goodnight, dear.' What's the matter, huh? Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight, everybody. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Melissa. - Goodnight. Oh, that grandfather business! - It's the greatest. - How old is she? Almost five. - Mr. Nast. - 'Mm?' Isn't that awful young to own a prostitution hotel? - 'Fran, you gotta be joking.' - 'I'm not!' The Melissa Corporation owns the Copper Kettles. It also owns the building that houses the Mona Lisa Hotel. I just didn't know until tonight that Harlan Nast 'is the principal of both.' "An old-fashioned man with old-fashioned morals." How do you know that? I have a copy of the certificates of incorporation. Oh, come on, Fran, you lease a building to someone. Now, you don't necessarily know what's going on it it. Oh? Even when the lease falls for a percentage of the gross? A very sizable gross? Oh, you're making a big thing out of this. - It's not his responsibility! - Ugh. There goes another lapel button. You don't mean you're really gonna mention Nast's name in your article? - He'll be in good company. - Don't act naive. It could be very embarrassing for a man in his position. And don't you think it's embarrassing for Wanda when she sits in the prost van or the bullpen? You're not equating Harlan Nast with an 8th Avenue hooker. - Why not? - Because it's her own choice! Fran, nobody makes her go on the streets. She likes the money! And so does Nast! Since they share the fruits of free enterprise why shouldn't they share the embarrassment? Yeah, I can't believe this whole thing. I mean, what do you think you're going to accomplish? 'Make a few headlines, get a few hotels closed down?' They'll only be open again in a couple of months. Fran, I don't know what you.. ..expect of me. There aren't any land slots anymore. I've got a twenty million dollar project hanging in the balance and I-I don't wanna lose it. Is that so hard to understand? Everybody hustles. [sighs] Some of us just don't... get arrested for it. [engine revving] I don't see any point in coming up. Well, let's give it a rest.. ...for a while. I have to, uh, sort myself out. Maybe you do, too. [engine revving] Excuse me, ma'am, there is somebody to see you. - I put her in the side lobby. - Oh. Ms. Morrison. I'm sorry, we can't have whores around. Don't look good for the house. Then who the hell's living in all those twelve hundred dollar penthouses upstairs? Wanda? Yeah, I-I-I figured I was all the way up here might as well wait. Well, I'm glad you did. Come on, let's go upstairs. I can't, I can't. I gotta get back to work. It ain't nothin' big. It's just, uh...Dee Dee. Well, she ain't been around all weekend, and.. ...I went up to her place, and she ain't there, and, uh none-none of the girls have seen her-- Well, maybe she's up in the Bronx with her baby. Oh! Pfft. They took Stacey away. The welfare. People that was keepin' they.. ...said they couldn't do it on the money. Oh, no. Does she know that? Yeah. They told her. They couldn't get her, so they-they-they called me. Well, what did they.. How did she take it? Well, you know, alright, real quiet. I thought maybe, maybe she didn't hear me.. ...but she heard. What can I do to help? Well, um, you know, I can't go to the police so I thought, if-if you could go to them-- Oh, I'll call, I'll call Swifty, I'll call him. Yeah, thanks. Uh...um.. You know, uh.. I, uh.. I-I-I shouldn't have ridden her like that, I.. ...I shoulda let her cry, if she felt like it. Oh. Hey. Don't feel guilty. You're a good friend to Dee Dee. You care about her-- Come on! There's no friends on the street. She's just on my corner, that's all. Another couple months, there'll be a different girl. I don't believe that, otherwise you wouldn't be here. I don't give a damn what you believe. I don't even believe that. Would you get off my back? You friggin' square, would you just leave me alone? [dramatic music] [Fran] I don't know what she thinks could have happened. But she's afraid to go to you. [Swifty] I'm looking at the book now. There's nothing on it. [Fran] Isn't there something you can do? [Swifty] I'll send a couple of men out to canvas The Times Square joints. Where will you be? [Fran] I'll be home. [music continues] [Dee Dee] 'And that's St. Sebastian. They call it the Midtown chapel.' - 'Close to the hotel.' - 'Yeah, the priest there.' [Dee Dee] 'He's always giving Larry the business.' [Wanda] 'Callin' the cops, raise the roof.' 'But the priest, he ain't against the girls, though.' 'When I see the van comin', I always duck in.' And he says, "Hey, gal, wanna pray?" And I, "Sure." 'He knows I'm waitin' till the cops go by.' [Giselle] 'And now, over here, now, this' 'This is where we hide out when we're runnin' from the van.' [Fran] 'Wait, you mean that big building?' [indistinct] [Wanda] Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow-slow down. Yeah, and I found this place, right.. You see over there, behind that big piling? Yeah, well, they got some kind of fire stairs. And we can run up three, four stories. And nobody can ever find us. [music continues] Dee Dee! No, no, please. One more. Dee Dee! [music continues] Dee Dee! Dee Dee! [music continues] [intense music] Oh, dear God. [male #10] 'Is that her?' This way, please. Okay, you gotta sign a couple of these forms certifying these are the identifiable remains. Yeah. Where the "X" is, please. Okay. That's it. What happens to her now? Well, unclaimed, no next of kin. City will dispose of the body. 'You know her religion?' What does that mean? "Dispose of?" It don't mean a 21 gun salute. Harry, uh, we're running another one off here. Carbons came out. What does it mean? What do you want from me? ...I mean, they'll take her out to Hart Island and then plant her in potter's field, okay? You dirty.. [indistinct yelling] Get off! Get off! Come on, lady! Wait a second. Harry, get me a straitjacket Take your hands off, I'll take care of her I'll take care of her. Go. Leave her now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. [sobbing] [male #11] I commend to your mercy, O Lord. Your servant, Dorothea Snyder. 'She was 18.' 'A child, your child.' 'I saw her only in flight.' 'Now she has stopped running.' She is at rest with you. 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.' 'He maketh me to lie down in green pastures' 'he leadeth me beside the still water.' 'He restoreth my soul.' 'He guideth me in straight paths, for his namesake.' 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death' 'I shall fear no evil. 'For thou art with me.' 'Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.' Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.. '...and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.' [eerie music] - Thank you, father. - You're welcome. [sighs] Radio says it's gonna rain. She'd have been glad. Not many pricks out in the rain. Where can I drop you? Downtown? [music continues] I wanna stay here. I just wanna be by myself, you know? Uh-uh, hey. Might need it. [engine revving] [music continues] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [Wanda] Oh! You-you didn't have to come here, uh, I mean, you know. If you was busy or somethin'. [Fran] No, I wanted to. I only got your number this morning. Oh, yeah. I decided to kinda quick. It's my pa, you know. Just got this letter from my brother. He's, uh, raisin' hell again. Gettin' drunk, gobblin' pills, you know. Hurtin' himself, this and that. Oh, thanks. And, uh, you know.. ...the authorities.. Oh, thanks. The authorities, they want us to commit him to Conroy. That's a state hospital. - State hospital? - Yeah. I've been there. I'm tellin' ya, no matter what they call it, it's still a jail. Wouldn't want him to go to no jail. What else could he do? Could he stay with your brother? My brother? My brother's got a wife, a couple of kids. It's hard havin' someone like pa around, you know. "Hey, kids. "Go down to corner bar "get grandpa a couple of shots and a beer chaser." So I figured, you know, maybe needs me, oh. Oh, I might get a, get a place, you know, keep it for a while. There's a...job at the plant where my-my brother works. It's not nine to five. It's eight to four. [chuckling] Watch out with this. It weighs a ton. I took my pots and pans. I cook a three pan meatloaf, you know, when I get the time. You like meatloaf? Yeah, I make a pretty fair one myself. Oh, yeah. Too bad, we coulda had a bake off. Hey, how come come Sweet's letting you go? How's he gonna stop me? Kill me. He says I'll be back within a month. He says it's in my blood. The money, the excitement. Him. Yeah, what's what Sweet says. What do you say? I don't know. Oh...something for you to read on the plane. 'Just came out today.' Oh, here's your umbrella. I almost forgot. You could have kept it. I don't like, uh.. Owing somebody. Yeah, I know. Wanda, it's okay to owe somebody. It's good. [air whooshes] Hey! Wait a minute! What's the rush? You creep! Open the door. You can't even wait for somebody? 'Don't you see someone's waitin'..' '...outside? You can't even give me a minute?' [engine revving] [instrumental music] Columbus Circle. Go up 8th.
