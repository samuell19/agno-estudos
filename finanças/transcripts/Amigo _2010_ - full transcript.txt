IF THEY DON'T SURRENDER, WE WILL HUNT THEM DOWN AND KILL THEM. YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THIS? TELL HIM. HIS NAME IS RAFAEL DACANAY, AND HE HAS BEEN CABEZA DE BARRIO HERE, AS WAS HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM, FOR TEN YEARS. IT IS HE WHO COLLECTS THE TAX FOR THE GOVERNMENT. GOOD DUTY IF YOU CAN GET IT. AND WHAT HE IS NOT ABLE TO COLLECT, HE MUST PAY FROM HIS OWN POCKET. NOT SO GOOD. BRASS ON THE HORIZON, LIEUTENANT. EVERYTHING LOCKED DOWN HERE, LIEUTENANT? YES, SIR. WE TOOK THE BARRIO WITH NO RESISTANCE-- ONLY A COUPLE OF RUNAWAYS. PICK TEN YOU CAN TRUST AND WORK OUT THE BILLETING. SIR? CAN'T HAVE THE MONKEYS SNEAKING IN BEHIND US WHILE WE'RE CHASING AGUINALDO UP THE ISLAND. I NEED A GARRISON HERE. MY BOYS ARE HOT TO GO, COLONEL. STAYING HERE WOULD BE-- I NEED A GARRISON. YES, SIR. HELL, FOR ALL I KNOW, OLD AGGY'S HIDING RIGHT IN THIS VILLAGE. YOU COULD SMOKE HIM OUT AND END THE WAR. LORD KNOWS I CAN'T TELL ONE FROM THE OTHER. MAY I THANK YOU, COLONEL, THAT YOU DELIVER US FROM CAPTIVITY. THIS IS PADRE HIDALGO. THE LOCAL INSURRECTOS HAD HIM CAGED UP IN THE BODEGA ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF DONS THEY CAUGHT. WE'LL GET YOU BACK TO MANILA AS SOON AS WE CAN, PADRE. THESE ARE MY CHILDREN. THEIR SOULS ARE IN MY CARE. I CANNOT LEAVE THIS PLACE. YOU GOT YOURSELF AN INTERPRETER, LIEUTENANT. ZUÑIGA! YOU VAMOS WITH US. YOU HOLD ONTO A SIGNALIST AND SOME COOLIES TO HANG THE WIRE TOMORROW, AND YOU KEEP IT SINGIN'. GET THESE PEOPLE UP OUT OF THE DIRT, FOR GOD'S SAKE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WINNING THEIR HEARTS AND MINDS! YES, SIR! WHATLEY AND NINE I CAN TRUST, SERGEANT. WHATLEY, THOMAS... CASEY, DORTMUNDER... LYNCH, PEDERSON, FITZSIMMONS, ANDREWS, SHANKER AND McBRIDE-- YOU WILL REMAIN HERE ON GUARD! THE REST OF YOU FALL OUT AND FORM UP BEHIND THE COLONEL. ON THE DOUBLE! WHOSE SHACK IS THAT? IT BELONGS TO THIS SAME MAN. IN THAT CASE, TELL HIM HE'S GOT FIVE MINUTES TO REMOVE HIS PERSONAL ITEMS. THAT'LL BE MY HEADQUARTERS. TELL HIM WE'RE STAYING HERE TO PROTECT HIS VILLAGE FROM THE LADRONES. TELL HIM HE'S STILL HEAD MAN, WHICH MEANS IF THERE'S TROUBLE, IT'S HIS HEAD. HOLD THAT FIRE! DO NOT SHOOT! DO NOT SHOOT! IT IS THE TIME OF THE ANGELUS. THIS IS HIS DUTY. PRAYERS. EVERY DAY AT THE SIX. IT IS OUR CUSTOM. HAVE SOMEBODY CLIMB UP THERE AND YANK THE CLAPPER OUT OF THAT BELL. LYNCH. WHEN THE SUN IS UP, YOUR GOOGOO JUST LAYS AROUND EATING BANANAS AND WATCHING CHICKEN FIGHTS. BUT THE MINUTE IT GETS DARK, HE LIKES TO CREEP UP THROUGH THE JUNGLE WITH THAT BOLO HE CARRIES, AND THEN CHOP-CHOP! WE LOST MORE GOOD AMERICANS THAT WAY THAN WE EVER DONE IN BATTLE. DEADEYE'S RELIEVING YOU, PRIVATE. GET SOME SLEEP. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER HERE KILLING SPANIARDS. JUST KILL SOME IN YOUR DREAMS. CHANGE YOUR POSITION EVERY NOW AND THEN. THEY CAN'T SHOOT FOR SHIT, BUT NO SENSE MAKING AND EASY TARGET. RIGHT. FOUR HOURS, SON. DON'T LET US DOWN. POSTED? FOUR CORNERS. I TOLD THE REST OF THE BOYS TO SLEEP WITH THEIR BOOTS ON JUST IN CASE. MY FEET HAVEN'T BEEN DRY SINCE CALOOCAN. GRAB A SPOT. EASY DUTY HERE. MIGHT BE. PLAY CARDS... AND SWAT FLIES. YOU WERE OUT WEST. REGULAR ARMY. FIFTEEN YEARS. DRAGGIN' REDSKINS BACK TO THE RESERVATION. YOU? BEFORE I VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS MESS, I BUILT HOUSES... GREAT, BIG ONES. LIEUTENANT. THAT PADRE... HE'S GOT HIS OWN DEAL RUNNIN' HERE. I WOULDN'T TRUST HIM. RELIGION IS A CIVILIZING INFLUENCE, SERGEANT. AND IF HE CAN HELP KEEP A LEASH ON THESE PEOPLE, HE'S WELCOME TO THEIR SOULS. YES, SIR. AND I DON'T TRUST HIM. TO YOUR POSTS! DON'T SHOOT TILL YOU SEE SOMETHING! THEY COMIN'? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING OUT THERE. WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING OUT THERE, DAMNIT. WHAT DO WE DO, SARGE? WE WAIT TILL THE SUN COMES UP. I'LL LET THE OTHERS KNOW. THERE DAMN WELL BETTER BE A DEAD GOOGOO OUT THERE, BOY. ATTAGO, DEADEYE. AT LEAST YOUR AIM IS GETTING BETTER. I ATTENDED SEMINARY IN VALLADOLID, BUT I WAS BORN IN TOLEDO. THE ALHAMBRA. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE? NO. I STUDIED THE BUILDING. SO YOU DECIDED TO BE A MISSIONARY. THE FILIPINAS ARE A COLONY OF SPAIN-- "WERE." WERE A COLONY OF SPAIN. SERVICE HERE IS NOT ONLY A RELIGIOUS DUTY, BUT A PATRIOTIC ONE. WE ARE SOLDIERS OF GOD. THE PEOPLE HERE LISTEN TO YOU? THEY LISTEN, BUT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS OBEY. I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP. WHICH I OFFER FREELY IN ANY MATTER THAT DOES ENDANGER THE MORALS OF MY FILIGRESES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. YOU'RE NOT A CATHOLIC. NO. I MUST WARN YOU THAT THE MORAL PATH IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST OBVIOUS. CAN YOU WALK? IF IT GETS ME TO THE CLAP SHACK, I'LL CRAWL BACK TO MANILA. I'M PUTTING THESE PEOPLE IN YOUR CARE. NO SWEAT, SARGE. ALL RIGHT, YOU DAGOES-- VAMOOSE! THERE ARE TWO HARVESTS. ONLY DURING JULY AND AUGUST DOES THE LAND REST. AND THE VILLAGERS OWN THE LAND TOGETHER? HE OWNS THIS LAND, AND THAT. THE PEOPLE ARE KASAMAS-- THEY WORK FOR A PORTION OF WHAT THEY HARVEST. SO AMIGO HERE HAS GOT THE WHOLE DEAL SEWED UP. THE LANDS BEYOND, AND MANY MORE YOU CANNOT SEE, ARE MINE. WHEN I AM PRISONER, THE PEOPLE, THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THEM. BUT IF THEY'RE WORKING FOR SHARES... THIS IS THE POLO-- A WORK THAT IS A DUTY OVERSEEN BY THE CHURCH AND THE GUARDIA CIVIL. AND YOU RAKE IN ALL THE PROFITS. I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. TELL HIM THE PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THE CROP JUST LIKE ALWAYS, ONLY THAT DIKE THERE, THAT'S THE DEAD LINE. ANYONE STEPS PAST THAT WITHOUT PERMISSION, WE SHOOT THEM. AND TELL HIM FROM NOW ON HE CAN WORK HIS OWN DAMN FIELDS WITH EVERYONE ELSE. IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO DO THIS. ALL RIGHT! HUSTLE, BOYS! DO YOU HEAR ME? WE'RE COMIN' WITH THAT WIRE. CHOP-CHOP! HEY! BOSSMAN! YOU WORKEE COOLIE TOO HARD. WHERE YOU HEADED? BACK TO MANILA. SO'S YOU CAN INFECT THE REST OF THE WHORES IN SAMPALOC. THAT'S A NICE LITTLE CREW YOU GOT. YEAH, THAT'S, UM, THAT'S CHOP-CHOP, AND THE SOURPUSS THERE I CALL "CHUCKLES." THAT'S, UM, "SKINNY," AND THAT ONE THERE, THAT'S "MOON."

"ANY DISTRICT OR COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY AN ENEMY "STANDS UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW OF THE INVADING COUNTRY. "GREAT SEVERITY IN THAT MARTIAL LAW MAY BE EXERCISED IN REGIONS WHERE ACTUAL HOSTILITIES EXIST." "MEN WHO COMMIT HOSTILITIES "WITH INTERMITTING RETURNS TO THEIR HOMES AND AVOCATIONS, "DIVESTING THEMSELVES OF THE CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE OF SOLDIERS, "SHALL BE TREATED NOT AS COMBATANTS, BUT AS BANDITS AND MURDERERS." "GUIDES, WHEN IT IS PROVED THAT THEY HAVE MISLED INTENTIONALLY, "AND THOSE DISGUISED IN THE CIVILIAN DRESS OF THE COUNTRY "BUT EMPLOYED IN OBTAINING INFORMATION FOR THE ENEMY, SHALL BE TREATED AS SPIES AND SUFFER DEATH BY HANGING." * COMO SE? CAPITAN. CAPITAN... YOUR FILIPINO... IS LIKE A MIX BETWEEN A MEXICAN AND A CHINAMAN. THE MISSING LINK. A STUNTED RACE. HELL, EVEN THEIR HORSES ARE PUNY. WE MISSED OUT ON THEM CUBAN WOMEN. WHORES ARE WHORES. NOT THE WHORES-- THEM TOBACCO-ROLLING SEÑORITAS, THE ONES THEY SHOW ON THE CIGAR BOXES. YOU'RE AS GREEN AS DEADEYE HERE. MAYBE I OUGHTA GIVE THESE GOOGOO DOLLS A TUMBLE.

MURDERERS. ASK HIM WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT THIS. WHAT HE SAYING? HE'S A LIAR. WHAT'S HE SAYING?! HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. TELL HIM HE CAN HELP BURY THIS BUNCH. AND YOU CAN DO THE CEREMONY.
