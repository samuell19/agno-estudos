Sub created by shreyashjit Footprints! A predator! Extremely suspicious. I have to catalog them and warn the herd. Zico misses nothing. Certainly not any ... Ah, insect! Could be a poisonous whitefly. Hold still and be cataloged. Butterflies! Get out of here! Flutter someone else's lens. I have to document a deadly insect here . Come back immediately! I need a photo! Heartless M ... monster! - Ouch! - Ah no! I'm too young to die! I don't even taste good! I eat too much garlic! Everyone thinks I'm inedible! Yes, undoubtedly a strong garlic flag. - Yes, I also told her ... - Now go ahead, help out! Gosh! The jackals almost ran away with supplies last night . I can find out which guards fell asleep there. Uh, Magra. W ... w ... it wasn't us. Well, I wonder who it was then ...!? Oh, by the way: where's Gray? Greyg. Don't let me down, legs! And don't worry, small intestine! I managed not to become a lamb chop for a long time . And it should stay that way! I do n't want to be eaten! Gosh ... Aaaah! Out of the way! I run for my life! Monsters are chasing me! Gosh ... Gosh ... Excuse me! This looks delicious. Unfortunately I have to continue. Aaah ... Almost there! So many levels ... I'm not made for that. Aaah ... Where is it? Where is it Oh ... I should sort my clutter alphabetically. That! I... So let's see. Zombies? No. Vampires? No. Goblins? Ouw! And no! Dragon? Water demon? Orc? Mosquito? Ahaaaa! Canis lupus. Dangerous, sheep-eating monster, commonly known as ... wolf !? Wolves? Wöööööölfe! COMPLETELY FROM WOOL Sheep! A whole village full of sheep! Everything is ready for harvest. Great, let's get it! We don't hunt for sports, Gray. We only catch what we need to survive. Every life is sacred. Phew! Okay, when you say that ... Open your ears, pack. This is our new home. - Yes, Magra! - Exactly! Here we want to live long and in peace. Yup! I was your leader wolf for over a hundred moons . But now... it's time to retire What? Retirement? But why? Magra, don't leave us! According to the law of ancestors , the strongest male must be earn the right to lead by defeating their rivals. Who are the contenders? I think I could ... It has always been my dream. - I want to try it. - I! - No, I better leave it. - I changed my mind. - I'm not a leader. - Well? Do you just want to be led by Ragear? Does nobody compete against him? - Uh. Uh Uh - He is not serious! I! - Gray is up against him? - Yes exactly! Let's set the rules. I suggest we fight ... until death. What does "until death" mean? How about a dance duel instead ? Great body feeling! In three days, noon. Gray against Ragear. The winner becomes the new leader. I want. I want! Alarm! Alarm! All heard! Zico, stop it! I already have a headache without the noise. But they have ... not everyone has heard it yet. Red alert! Emergency! Oh! Sheep in heaven, Zico, not again. What is it this time? Deadly dandelions? - Aaah! - Fre-eu-eunde! As leader, I have terrible news for you. Unfortunately I spilled the salt. I know. It was an accident. What's so terrible about it Spilling salt is bad luck. Moz, screw your horns on and just walk over to her. Are you kidding, Ike? She is so ... And I'm not ... what if I ... - and then when ... - What? Beat you up? Bites? Are you falling forever? - Hey! - What? Guys are strange. Friends! Don't you see the bad omen? The misfortune is already there. Tell them. He is right, my brothers and sisters. With my superior intelligence and tireless effort ... I discovered the most hideous and deadly threat. See heeeeer! We were attacked by ... a pumpkin scarecrow? Ha? No! We were attacked by wolves! - What? - wolves? Seriously? He keeps coming with monsters ... You probably rang the bell too often ! You think it's funny, huh !? Well, let's see if you laugh about it too ... So! From now on, the north pasture is prohibited for every sheep! I forbid all of you to go there! - Bucho, close the gate! - Will be done. Good. Now we are in complete safety. Mmh-hm-hm-hm-hm ... And, Bianca, are you going to the party tonight? Hmm ... it depends. If my appointment makes it in time. Who is the lucky one? Sure a handsome devil guy? Do not make fun of it. Are you ready to fight Ragear? I am always ready! Then prefer to win. When Ragear becomes our new leader, we are all in trouble. Do not worry. Close your eyes. Now open it again. What a sweet surprise! What? The? Just wait until tonight. It will only be a surprise! Run, you idiots! Looks like Ragear is breaking the ban on hunting. - He needs a lesson. - Don't get involved. - It's time for you to ... - Yes, time to go! Grow up. Bianca! What surprise was he talking about? I guess Gray will ask the crucial question today . - What question? - "Will you marry me?" Aaah ... oh, oh, oh! That is so cool! Oh ... look there! It looks like a fish! With huge, sharp teeth! You know... the north pasture was forbidden to everyone , but here we are. Shia, I don't think that was a good idea. Don't be such a scaredy. What should happen? - Um ... I ... e-it's already happening! - Huh? Faster, you chandelier! But Magra said we shouldn't go hunting. Magra, this simpleton! I will abolish the laws. But you have to b-defeat Gray first . Well, is there someone ignoring Magra's orders? Better chase after your own cock! - Later. I just wanted to warn you. - What from? - In front of the tree. - Which tree? Ah! All right. Don't delay it! What are you waiting for? Eat me! Eat you up? No offense, little one. But you're not even big enough for a snack. Go home. Go, go, go, go, go. Did you my brother saw? Moz! - Did you see Shia? - Sh-Shia? Um ... I, no. I mean, uh ... I didn't. Actually... Whoa. Got you - Ike, what about you? - Uh ... Shia, where have you been? On the north pasture? Uh ... no way was I on the north pasture. I mean, what was I doing there ? That would be insane. I'm not crazy. - Yes! - Great, ladies! - Don't stop, ladies! - That's how I like it. And boom, in full swing. Against the only tree. You should have seen his stupid face. Whose face, hobbler? Tell it to me. - I like to hear funny stories. - What I, uh, said ... An ode to Ragear! - What? Who is this? - Isn't it gray? The eyes hardly open, the mind like in a dressing gown. He runs like a drunk. Boing! And is stupid like a ram. Diddliddliddliddliddli ... - Where's he going? - He should hurry better. Here comes the wild bull! Surprise! I don't quite understand it. Should that be the marriage proposal? Nobody would have expected that. Now I'm making fun of you! You and funny ?! Who wants a lousy Peter as a leader? Do you think they'd rather have a clown? Let us ask you. Raise your paws for a strong, clever and experienced leader. Raise your paws! - Raise your paw! - Raise her! Who wants a happy, friendly pack without piesackeni? - Yes! I! - A peaceful pack! - Yes / Yes! - Exactly! Hey Bianca hasn't voted yet Ha-ha-ha! Bianca, little one. Raise your paw. Come on. So what's going on? Bianca! Bianca! Bianca, what's going on? Wait! Stupid stone. I can't believe you didn't vote for me. You're not good for the leader, Gray. You lack the necessary maturity. Like getting married. How can you actually talk about getting married if you only think of childish pranks? Marry? Who wants to get married? For a month you have been saying, "Oh, I have a surprise! A huge surprise! You will be off your socks! " Well, and it was all off the socks. Oh! - I don't want to wait anymore, Gray. - Waiting for what? Miracle, Gray. That you change. But I love you! Take care, Gray. I am done with you. Hey Bianca, wait. I'm changing. Promised! Bianca? Bianca! Biancaaaaa! - Let us dance! - Not bad, little one! - I'm getting sore muscles. - Yes! - Freedom, brother! - Brothers? I am your cousin! Out of the way! Do you see? Gray is not a leader. He is just a clown. For him it's all Halligalli. You're right. He's not grown up enough. But you ... you put your interests above those of the pack. - And? - And ... a fight decides. The most sobering party ever. Hmm... Well, that sounds like a party. Thanks for coming! And now, friends, continue with magic tricks, Food, joy and fortune telling. But first ... a surprise. From the highest peaks of the snowy Himalayas. Wild bear! Indeed. A bear. Who comes to the party with a wild bear? Maybe we'd better get away !? And miss the divination? - Again! - That was great! Your party is cool! Wolf! Running! Uh, wait. You have magical tricks ... promised. Can you really do magic tricks? Uh, uh, uh, uh ... yes, of course! Magic! Take a card. Whoa! What is it supposed to do? We need something special here. Aaah! Bravery mix. Thanks, but I really don't need more ... bravery. What? No, this potion is for me. The rabbits are burning! You are absolutely right here , my friend. If you want to see miracles, you have to go into mom's caravan. Great! Where can I find this mommy? - She's sitting in front of you, little one. - Yes ... I could have guessed. Here, take this. It brings you luck. I don't need a horseshoe, but ... Wait! Stop! Don't say anything anymore. Uh, you need ... the panties of agility, the helmet of security? The belt of chastity !? The Cup of Happiness !? The bucket of nastiness? The balls of craziness, craziness, craziness ...!? Craziness! No! I need... A fur tint? Highlights? You are gray from top to bottom. I am gray! Listen! I don't have to change my coat color. I have to change myself. I have to get Bianca to love me again. Do you want her to love you? Or do you want to change? I do not understand. Aah! You change to love you, jal? Ha! Women ... Listen, it has been a long day. Why don't you come back tomorrow? But Bianca will not be patient until tomorrow. I see that these are good starting conditions. Aaaah! Not so stormy! Squat down, Sidney. Where's ... ah! There He is. The transformation magic over k. What? Who should be able to read that? Let's see ... two teaspoons of magic, magic, hocus-pocus ... transmutation? Transmutation! I do n't know what that means. Midnight ... under no circumstances ... boring! Here. Drink it up. And will Bianca love me again? Just a way to find out. Down with it! Mmh! Does n't taste that bad ... No exchange if you don't like it. And? Have i changed Am I adorable now? Uh ... oh, every bet. What about Bianca? It will freak out. Thanks, Mommy! I owe you. - Uh ... whatever you mean. - Biancaaa! So, uh, baron. Time to pack up and move on. How you mean. Street life is the gypsy lot ... Now! Yeah! I have changed. Bianca, a miracle has happened! I got myself ... Oops, what's going on here? Why can't I ... Aaaaaaah ... H-H-H-H-H-H-Hobbler! Ahh! Mmmm! Ever seen that a steak comes to dinner by itself? Hey, be careful! Huh? What ... I had taken off the sheepskin. - Ouch! - No, no, no ... wait. - Hm? - I should drink up, right? And I did that. I drank it and something went wrong! Guys? Guys! That can not be true! I'm just dreaming! Aah! I have him! II got it! Skinny, I won't let you eat me ! Run! Panic! Run! Panic! No, keep running! Aaah! Ha? ♪ Hey? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aah! Aaaah! Dude? Are you still alive? Hey buddy!? I've never seen him here before. Let's take him home to Lyra . She can surely help him. - Ja ... - Mmh ... Stay nice. You need rest now. Oh, I had a terrible dream. - I was a sheep. - A sheep? - Well, that's a dream ... - Where's Bianca? - You are a sheep! - Exactly. I am a sheep and you are also a sheep. What? What did you do to me Oh no, I'm a sheep! I smell like an old buck! Und, aah! Oh no! Where is my face I have a basket head, ah! They broke the mirror shortly after the salt spilled. Terrible things will happen. And all of us! How could that get worse !? You look familiar to me. Have you been to cooking class? What? From where? I've never seen you in life Oh! Not really? Strange... Tell us: where are you from, stranger? I? Uh, I'm from, well, back there. From the east. Then he probably belongs to the eastern flock. But there is no one left of the eastern flock. Yes. Only I am still there. All relatives were eaten by ... - Piranhas. - Oh my goodness! Piranhas? Here, in this part of the world? Yes. You know, those were ... piranhas traveling. With small cases and everything. Oh, it was terrible! I mean, I wasn't there myself. My father said: Gray, go to the forest and collect what we sheep love to eat. - pine cones and such ... - pine cones? Gray, you say !? This is a strange name for a sheep. Yeah, right? My father, uh, gave us nicknames. He gave the names according to the colors of the rainbow. I am the seventh-born. Well, all the colors were gone. Oh, a nickname. I also have one. Welcome to the club, buddy. The area alone calls me the Mega-Moz. Uh, who's calling you that again? Coincidentally, someone said it to my face this morning. Yeah ... if you mean your reflection. Oh, Mr. Gray, please don't break mirrors anymore. I don't know how many times my heart can take it. Oh, and the salt ... keep your distance. OK? Hm? Hm! And that made my wool green. It stayed that way for months. I couldn't sit anywhere because everyone thought I was a bush. Oh, I fell asleep in the forest once and when I woke up the back of my knees were colored purple by the ... Uh, gray? What are you doing there? Oh nothing. I just have a serious identity crisis combined with a nightmare that I don't wake up from. Ah! Uh, uh ... what happened to you ? An excellent question, my fluffy friend. What happened? - I ... well, uh ... - Be silent! I have to get my sheep brain up to speed. Remain silent? I? Oh, I'm an expert in silence, sure. Once I was silent for six hours . Well, I woke up screaming, but that was my night fear. Yes, I'm afraid of sticks too. Oh, and water. And ears. Think about it! Think about it! - Hey, where are you in such a hurry, buddy? - I was on my way to Bianca. - We should get to know each other! - Then what was? Well, you're my new best buddy and so ... I fell down! That's it! Ha! I just have to fall down again! - Fall down? - Yes! I have to fall on my head and everything will go back to normal. OK. According to me. How you mean. It's your head Man, you're a lucky guy! Lyra will take care of you! Why didn't I fall on my head? It smells so good. Your cinnamon-colored head skin turns me on. Your wool looks like silk. It sure feels that way too. Not that I ever shook her hand. Uh, gray, you should pay attention to where you ... Aah! - ... Hinläufst. Grey? G rey! He thinks he's a bird. Can't believe what !? Almost as crazy as a bird who thinks it's a sheep. Yes. A bird that thinks he's one of us. Completely crazy! Poor boy. The piranhas must have really traumatized him. Attention! He jumps to his own death! I catch ... I catch you! Mega-Moz rushes to ... Well. The head falls do nothing. What am I supposed to do now? Just a suggestion, but you could get off me. You're heavier than a Himalayan bear! A bear from the peaks of the Himalayas! The transformation magic over k. Down with it. Bear! Gypsy! Weird Potions! Mom! Thank you, Mini-Moz! Oh, it's called, uh, Mega-Moz! You were an amazing audience. It was nice to meet you. But I'm out of here! It's all very suspicious. Find mommy, drink antidote and poof, I'm a wolf again! What should go wrong? Mommy? Mommy? where is everyone? They're gone. Haven't found him yet ? He probably just ran away. To avoid the duel. We both know that 's not true. Didn't you tell him to leave? - That is clear, Bianca. - No. We broke up. - That is something different. - It's the same. Thank you. Already understood. Neeein! Wiesoooo? - Au. Ouch! - Good Morning. Sorry to wake you up, Gray, but I'll have a customer right away. Make yourself fresh and come for breakfast. There is carrot pudding today. Plus pumpkin. - Bäääääh! - Come on! - Bäääääh! - Bäääääh! Sister heart, can Gray stay with us forever? Gosh! 'Oh! Good Morning! Just come in. This weather ... what do I do with such hair? Scrub pots? Do not worry. I'll fix that , Marlene. Uh, sister heart? Can I get out and with gray, um ... play hide and seek? With the other kids? Great idea. But take your packed lunch with you this time . Woo-hooo! Let's go now, Gray! - What? Hide? - Do not worry. Not hide. - Hey buddy! There you are! - Huh? - HaHooo! - Moz! Just get out of here! I still have so much to tell you! Ready for a sheep-like day of exciting stories? Oh, hi Moz! How are you? Eh, hi, Hummertopf! Noodle Soup! - Idiot! - Cooler Hut, Grey! Oh! Hey guys! There you are. Oh! The little flower suits you. - Do you want to go somewhere? - No. - To the tournament. - Nowhere. You go to the tournament? Yes! I'm coming with you, okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? What tournament? - "Horns and Hooves" tournament! May the fight begin! What shoud that? Give it to me! Give me my flute! So, your sister is awesome, Shia! She is smart, pretty and I think she is soooo ... Alright. Cinnamon ... You know what!? With confidence ... A buddy of mine has a crush on her. One day they get married and are happy forever. You mean as soon as he gets more out of: - Lobster pot! Noodle dome? - Come on! Come on! Come on! What? You cheeky little nuisance! I'll be right away ... Now! Who of you dares to fight him? The undefeated despot of destruction. Kiiiiing Loooouiiis, der Fiiiiese! Yes! Let's go! Louis? This little imp is the undefeated despot? I saw more dangerous bottle openers. I mean, look at that, uh ... the, uh ... And it looks like we have a challenger. Uh what? My loyal fans! Hi! - Boo! - bite? - Oh no! - That's not fair! This is against the rules! Now fight back! Unfair something! - Yes, that's right! - You showed it to him! Excuse me... Come back when you're fighting like a real buck. But I'm not ... What did you think you were doing? First you tell me nothing, then you go to the tournament and Gray takes on Louis the nasty. Did you want him to die? That was not my fault. Uh, it was Moz! Everything his idea. Don't come on tour, young man! What am i doing I am a wolf. I don't eat grass. Mmm, but it tastes so good. No, that's disgusting! I am a predator. I need ... meat. No, I do not need. - Huh? What? - Stuuurzfluuuuuug! How's it going, buddy? Bad day, huh !? "Mies" is a real understatement. I really miss my pack. You can certainly understand that. What? I? How so? Do n't you miss your family ? I mean, you're a bird after all. Bird? Where? What? Hey I am a sheep! This is my family. What do you mean by that? You flew! Yes, you too today. Does that make you a bird now? Where can he be It is very dangerous so far from the village. - He could meet wolves. - wolves? Yes. Wolves. I can't ... land well. And you know what? Do you know what they called me? The flying manatee. A manatee! Can you imagine that!? Oh! A great family ... - Wöööööleeee! - wolves? Where? - So what do we do? - Sss-they accrue? Young boys! I'm so glad to see you ... What is i-in the driving? Aaaaaaaah! - Aaah! - Wait! - Away quickly! - Wow! - boys! Stands still! - Forget it! Skinny! Hobbler! It's me, gray! Hey Listen! How does he know our names? And he called himself Gray. E-he guessed gg-gut. Can't you run a sniff? We never get out of here at this speed . - Mommy? - Again in a circle, Dumbo. - D-ramm ... da-ra-ring ... - Mami! Mami! You better be hiding. Where's the gypsy Where's mommy I need to speak to her urgently ! Oh, hey little one! Um ... she's not here. I'm waiting. No, I mean ... I'm afraid ... she left us. She is dead, I mean. That can not be true. What should I do now? How do I become a wolf again? Potions! She had potions! Aaaah! Wow! Good! Huh? That's magic! Aaaaaah! Listen Why do you want to be a wolf at all? - You are a sheep. - I am a wolf! My friend, if something looks like a sheep, runs like a sheep and bleating like a sheep, it's probably a sheep. But I'm ... a wolf. Not bad at all, people! Light off! - Surprise! - Whoa! Whoa! Wait! What? How so? We organize this whole celebration in your honor alone. Uh, sorry, we started without you. Welcome! You're one of us now . Oh! Indeed? Remember ... Aau! We hereby award you the title of ... Wolf Tamer. - Yes! - Well done, Gray! Yeah So it is on the cake. Well ... stood! Uh, you ... with me ... dance floor. Yes! Very well! OK. I'm Lyra now. You give me the flower and then ask me to dance. Hello Lyra. May I around this ... tuna sandwich! Gray, can you defeat everyone with the attack? What else!? This is my super attack. - Even wolves? - Small thing! - Isn't there anyone who can defeat you? - I do not know. Maybe only Louis the nasty! On guard! Your little louse angel! That's enough. Off to bed, you old slaves. Or do I have to get the mint jelly first? - Why does she always say that? - How do I know? Hey, I have a better idea! Instead of going to bed, we should rather ... Go there, stop, smile, give flowers, say the whole sentence. Go there, stop, smile ... Gray, I've never met a buck like you. You're somehow different. Oh, Lyra, you don't know how right you are. Hey, um, I'll see if Ike has any cake left. I will be back soon. Lyra, maybe we could ... dumpling dough ... Nah ... Maybe we better go. I have a bad feeling. Come on when we see a wolf let's do the super attack and catapult him away. Hey-ah! Ohh... Beautiful... - Shia! - Was? Don't freak out right away. See how small they are. They can't even see us. Face it. Gray ran away. He was afraid and wanted to escape his responsibility. So I'm going to be the leader of the pack without a fight , right? No. That 's not how it works , Ragear. You know that in his absence everyone can jump out of the pack. And I will do that. I will represent Gray. Didn't you want to retire? A leader without respect for the ancestral laws only brings destruction. Ragear, you'll never become a leader while I'm still alive. No. You're right. But only as long as you are still alive. Shia? Shia? Shia? Shia! Friends, a tragedy has happened. In search of the runaway Gray, made our wise and brave leader, Magra, one wrong step and fell off the cliff. - He is dead! - No! That must not be! What are you keeping from us, Ragear? Maybe you pushed him down? Bianca, dear. You are annoyed, of course. - We all are, but ... - What? Does that mean you're our new leader? I think the pack is in good paws. - Tomorrow I will ... - Without a duel, not a leader! Think of this rule as abolished! Just like all of your so-called ancestral laws. The ceremony takes place at dawn. And for that I already have a juicy, young lamb. What were you doing on the north pasture? I had forbidden everyone to go there. Shia and I wanted to try the super attack. Gray said she helps against wolves. But she didn't. - Gray, that was so irresponsible! - I what? But wait. I just said ... I'm really sorry, Lyra. I had no idea that they wanted to try it out. I don't know, exactly. Would you have used your head before you talk so carelessly. Shia is at Leeeeeben! I saw everything! He is crouched in this pit next to the fire. I think he should land on the grill soon . Now we know where we are. My only ... So, Belgour. What's your rescue plan? Plan? Rescue? Did you get the wool tangled up? We are sheep, not a special unit! No way, Gray. But aren't you the leader of this herd? Of course I am. Until the moment ... everything becomes too gruesome. Nobody wants to do something? Really none of you? All right then. Well ... friends, I ... I know, uh ... a secret path to the wolf camp. If happiness holds me then I will be able to pull Shia out of her claws! A secret path? Really? I wonder how he knows it! - Yes". - What... - is going? - G-Gray will save Shia. What? Alone? What? Alone? Uh, um ... of course not. I won't let him go without Mega-Moz! Wait a moment! You come with? How so? So, I confess something to you, buddy. The one who is in love with Lyra ... Well ... that's me. Wow! That never occurred to me . Let's go, Romeo. Moz! If you make quiet noises , it doesn't make us quieter! Aha, that's it! Huh? Hey Don't forget: Only start with the command. Roger that? Yes, sir! Skinny. Hey, SkinnY! It's me. Shhh - Do not turn around! - Wa ... Wa-wa-wa ... If they ask you, you never saw me. It's easier to lie with the truth. Is the lamb in the pit? YYYYYYY-Ju- - Just nod for "yes"! - Sorry, buddy. - Nnnn-no! Ouch! He-he-he-hey-hey-hey-hey! Bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi ... - Shhh! - But who are you? GGGGGGG ... Yes, you hit the wolf on the skull. Bäm! Shia saw it too. Isn't it Shia? Um ... well ... yes! It's clear! With a stick Bäm, Bäm, one cleverly pulled over it. And you: "Don't mess with me!" And then, boom, bah, boom, cut out the others, Mega-Moz! What? Really? I guess I punched my head. I don't remember anything. Otherwise I never forget what ... I have a really hard pear. And I said: Mom, that's great for me , is n't it? And you: - You look gorgeous, boy! - They are back! What did I say? The stars stood favorably last night. I'm sorry sister heart! I will never lie to you again! Cross your heart! Honestly this time! - You live! - How did you do it? Yes, we owe it to him. We would be lamb burgers without the guy. Moz, great! I ... I, I, I ... turnip goulash! Wow, gray. I always thought she would kiss you someday. - And not Moz. - Shia, I have a girlfriend. - Huh? - Believe me, she is like no sheep. Bianca ... Bianca ... Bianca! - Where do you know my name from? - It's me, Gray! It's me. Gray? That's impossible. What happened to you? That was Mommy, the gypsy. The quirky rabbit gave me the wrong potion. A potion? What for? Well, you wanted me to change. Guess I took it too literally. Then I met sheep. By the way, these are great people! It's really terrible, Gray. Ragear is our new leader. - It's horrible. - Magra allowed that? Oh ... you do n't know yet, do you ? Magra is ... no longer there. He is dead. What have you done? For yourself !? - For all of us? - I meant it well, believe me. - I'll fix it. - Yes? Go away, Gray. Please get out of here. Don't let yourself be seen here anymore! Never again. Finally all pieces of the puzzle come together. What? What does that mean, fetched? - By whom? - It was GGGGGG ... What are you stuttering there Was the Stumps stammering? He was just trying to say: it was gray. - He's a sh-sh-sh ... - He's what? A shaman? A conductor? A shame? A treasure hunter? A template? - Okay, what is he? - Gray is now a sheep. Gray is now a sheep? What irony ... not a word of it to anyone! It wasn't gray. But sheep! These stupid, useless creatures! Today they steal our prey, and tomorrow they 'll kill us in our sleep at night! - Correct! - This is how it looks! See what they did to our brothers! - Incomprehensible! - Bestial! - Should they get away with it? - No, you pay for it! No! They won't! We make them pay for their atrocities! - We take revenge on them! - We will kill her! All! - Yes! - We create order in the valley! Just as the great Magra intended! And I'm telling you the truth. You can't trust him. He is a fox in rabbit fur! Who of you think he's really a friend? You? - He was kind to me. - Good question... No, he's not a real boyfriend, girlfriend. - What are you talking about? - He is a spy! No, not him! Do you want to trust a traitor who crosses enemy lines and then meet with wolves? What was the reason gray? They caught you to eat you, yes? So you agreed to betray us all. To tell everything about us! Just to save your fur! If this is a joke, Zico, this is the wrong time. I wish it was just a joke. But I have clear evidence that he's a lousy spy. Zico, we didn't know that you were a gifted singer. - Hm? Oh! - Are you spying yourself? - We trusted you. - What the... Gray. Dude. But why? Dude? Wake up! Your great gray is not a buddy, Moz! He is a snake! He took advantage of our warmth. Just like he betrayed his brothers to the East Herd ! On piranhas! When my head itched this morning , I knew right away that something terrible is happening. If you had washed it yesterday, none of this would have happened. That's ridiculous. Gray saved my brother. - Isn't it, Moz? - Uh, yes! I mean, uh, I do n't know. I passed out. And when I woke up, everything was saved. Without me. - How could you just! - I do not know. I was unconscious. No doubt he arranged everything with the wolves beforehand, to win our trust. This swindler ... Belgour, I say, let's kick the miserable cheater out. Throw me out? As if I wasn't fed up ?! - You useless, stupid creatures! - You, you sleeping pill, sneak around, scribble in your stupid notepad ... Did you notice, Zico, that nobody really likes you? And what is Ike doing for you? He makes sure that people eat. Oh, there's something else. I'm not throwing that away. That you fit through the door at all ... Hey e-ey, that's enough now! Stop it! Or what? Do you otherwise hide under the covers? You brave leader. He is a superstitious, cowardly chicken. Oh, your chin is facing south. I can't guide you guys. - This is an evil oma-än. - But... And Mister Plappermaul continues to sabble until the end of every day. Bla bla bla! Day in and day out! Except when it matters. If he tells Lyra his feelings, it says: pistachio stew! Lentils in zucchini sauce! Hey, come on! This is really not ... Really not? Don't tell what really isn't, Cliff! You are not a sheep! You are a pelican! Who probably has no pelican friends. That's why you're with the sheep. At some point they are fed up with you. That's enough for me. I used to be a seagull. And I Naivling bake him another cake ... Gray, wait! Why do you say things like that? How so? You have a good heart. No I have not. I am angry. A bad wolf. I know Gray. I knew immediately that it was you. You let me go, back then in the pasture. How can you be angry I'm sorry little one. Zico is right. There's no place for me here. Look. There he is. Fortunately I found you. Uh, I thought of something very important. You know, tomorrow at noon, there will be the effect of the magic well, it will be, somehow, how should I say? Irreversible. 'Ja_. That means you will remain a sheep for all time. Wait. No panic. Maybe there is still a solution. Dew! You mean something like a rope? No. What you need is dew. Magic dew. It only forms once a year in the clearing of the red pine. And tomorrow morning it's time again. Yes, finally I can go back to my pack! Not a bad idea. If you don't, you won't live long. Starting tomorrow it will be dangerous for a bleating sheep. What? What does this mean? Well, all wolves are on the war path. They attack the sheep village in the morning. But they'll kill everyone. You don't have to be a fortune teller to know that, super genius. So if you love your life stay away from the village. Better you go to the fir as quickly as possible. You can still make it. Yes, I can still make it. Gray, this is not the way to the fir. I know. Boss, everyone ready to go! Only Bianca is missing. It is unfortunately gone. We don't need it. Zico, let go. The village is in danger. No, let go! You are a spy and a traitor. What is going on here? The wolves will soon go hunting. And how exactly do you know that, you old smart guy? Well, I think I should know it as a spy , right? Maybe you're not a spy at all. But you pretend you're a spy. Why should I do that? Because then if it turned out that you were n't a spy at all, the perfect moment would be to really spy on us . - What? - Wait, I'm going to record it for you. Stop that nonsense. Listen every time. The wolves want to attack your village tomorrow morning . That means we have to act. Fast and determined. Gray is right. The moment of truth has come. This is our chance to ... Already run! Grab your stuff and run to the hills! It is too late. Even if you can run away , you will cursed your whole life to roam restlessly. Always from place to place. But what should we do? To be honest, I do n't think of roaming around badly. There is only one thing we can do. I say we stay and fight. Are you there? No. No, rather not. Uh, I have to go now. Stop! Guys, listen. We may not have fangs and claws but our strength is somewhere else. Our strength lies in unity. If we stick together we can take on anyone. From now on we are no longer a herd. We are a pack. A pack of wild sheep. And! 'Yes! Gray, you're back. So then. Do you show the wolves the super attack? - Yes! - My best buddy, you know? Ike, you're responsible for the food. Because you are the expert here. Moz, you are my assistant officer. Zico, as a clevester of all of us, you are responsible for planning. Cliff, you ... Where's Cliff? Cliff flew away. Well then we have to do it somehow without him. Look here. Okay. - pulls! - pulls! Looks good, boys. Stop this thing. I ca n't breathe, I'm afraid of heights. Well, now we are where we started. Yet again. I assume you are mommy. So your potion is to blame for the mess. Brain-free blokers. Time to show them who's boss here. Go ahead , get these stupid critters. What's going on, you idiots? Immediately forms a formation again. Attack! All right, friends, let's go. Foam sugar? Do you think sweets scare us? Have a look there. These are seagulls. Alpha, enemy build-up below in quadrant B-11 and -12. Roger, Delta. Bombing on arrival . Roger that. Wow, boys. How do you do that? Release. Are you crazy now ? These are just bees. Go on! Attac ke! Don't lie down with Mega-Moz. Oops, sorry. I ... I'm tearing you to shreds. Hey, I'm healed. Belgour, now. Listen to everyone. Plan B. IS? \ IS! You withdraw. The victory will be ours very soon. Go on. Quick, this way. Come on guys. One more piece. Yes, very good! Yes_. Water. We'll all drown. What should we do now? Boss, the stupid sheep tricked us. - Hurray. - Hurray. Gray, help us. Please, gray. The water floods the cave. They'll all drown. What are you planning now? Guys, we can't do that. You are my pack. My family. - We have to help them. - You want to help them? Why don't we roll ourselves in honey and introduce ourselves under a beehive? It is suicide. We have to help them. No matter whether sheep or wolf. The life of every animal is sacred. Shia! You have to listen to gray. If we let these wolves die, we're as bad as they are! Even worse. Because we, the sheep, are the good guys. We are, aren't we? Also! You heard the boy. Let us show these wolves what we sheep are made of. And I don't mean mutton chops. Do you realize what you are doing? Are you crazy? If you let them out of there, that's the end of us all. We won't bend a hair on either of you . I swear. I only trust a wolf as far as I can throw it. I want to say what is not very far . Zico. Stop chatting and help us. Thank you! I have to admit, not in a million. Years ago I would have thought that sheep so ... are so stupid! What? And I still say it. - Ragear? - one more step, and I crush it like a rancid blueberry. You monster, release him. What are you waiting for , comrades? On the bell to eat? Kill them! How could you forget Magra's ideals so quickly? When I left you were a brave wolf pack. Now you're just a gang of poor jackals looking for food. Slim? Has. You dare to speak of Magra. He only died because of you! And now you're dishonoring him with your new, fuzzy friends. Liar. I've watched everything. You argued and you ... - He killed Magra? - I am your leader. I give you your orders. You are not their leader, Ragear. You have to win a fight first. Is he wolf enough and accepts the challenge? - Do you want a fight? - Watch out! You can like that, you stupid, fluffy sheep. Do you think it's fluffy too? I taught him everything. - Come on, Gray. - Believe in you. I guess that's it. Now I will have to remain a sheep forever. Should I tell you something, Gray? You have always been a sheep. A stupid, useless sheep. Better a sheep than a breakaway worm like you, Ragear. - Who is this? - This is Bianca. To your bad luck there is no magic potion that will get you in could transform a wolf. I guess it's too late. Do you think I'll let you humiliate me in front of my pack? It's time you died, you failure. Grey. No. So who is your leader now? Answer me. Who's the lead wolf here? I'm the lead wolf, Ragear. I am the leader wolf. And you will never be a leader as long as I breathe . Well, just wait. You will still ... I hereby acknowledge your resignation . You did it. I always believed in you. Bianca, as a sheep I thought about a lot. There is something I have wanted to ask you for a long time. Do you want to be my wolf And now, power of my office, from the sun, the moon and the stars ... I hereby declare you man and woman. Don't forget to love and respect each other from today . Until death separates you. You can kiss the bride now. I am not a chatterbox. I'm more of a listener and don't talk much. I mean, Everyone knows that here. Everyone will tell you: "Moz ..." is a sheep of fewer words. " Once I picked clover that looked like a butt. Now shut up and kiss me. Here, you get one too. Do you know Now there is dancing. Do you see? It happened as I predicted. Every little detail. Amazing. Every detail? Are you absolutely sure about that? Well, except that Gray wasn't a sheep. And that the wolves attacked the village. And that the sheep save the wolves. Everything else. Roger that. But how did you get Bianca to do the magic dew paws so fast? More magical what? That was just old water from the Kristallsee. I guess Gray didn't need a potion at all . It was enough that he had changed internally. - You mean a real transformation. - Yes exactly. The End? Oh, actually, yes? Very strange.
