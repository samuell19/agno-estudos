Alfasa, and she said She doesn't think you should see the children for a while, Especially john-John... Till they get used to the idea. Felix. I'm leaving the cadillac. I won't go! They're waiting in the car. You snap a finger, whistle, i won't go. I'll accept that. How about moving your pigeon toes In the direction of the front door, And we'll get this show on the road? Woman: sandler agency. Harry sandler. Yeah. Did you get felix? No, i'm calling your father. Give him my love. What? Harry? I called the bel air house and palm springs. I didn't get an answer. I tried his beach number And got some deranged chinaman. Get felix on the phone. Tell him to be at david's office at 11:00. Right, dick. You tell him 11:00, Or it's his ass and your ass, too, harry. Got it? Uh, joyce sends her best. He wants to know how you are. How do i look? If i told him, he'd have another heart attack. She's terrific, harry. Now stop jerkin' off and call your client. Oh, bathing suits. Kids' bathing suits. I left a set of keys on your dresser. Mr. Farmer's residence. Harry sandler. I'm afraid mr. Farmer's out to lunch, mr. Sandler. I'm coming! Girl: bye, daddy! Daddy! Bye, daddy! Mommy, why can't daddy come with us? Mommy's having a very bad day. Man: a fire in downtown los angeles this morning Destroyed the oak hotel. Luckily, no injuries, But damage is estimated at $1.5 million. Now here's tammy taylor With her exclusive report from hollywood. "Night wind" opened in 800 theaters To unanimously bad reviews And, in spite of a mammoth advertising campaign, In the first week has grossed less money Than any film in the history of capitol studios. I have it on good authority that capitol's president David blackman is considering calling in all of the prints. For christ's sake, can't somebody find him? I've been on the phone all morning. What about sandler? I told him it was his ass if felix wasn't here. What did the lawyers say? Cut the film, he can sue. Well, then, what's the answer? Scare the hell out of him, then give him your ideas. Ideas? It's a piece of shit. Oh, absolutely. That's one thing i can do i'm proud of... I'm a damn good cutter. You sure are. I, uh, ran the film twice last night. The cutter agrees with most of your suggestions. Yeah, but would he say so to felix? I think so. He's been with felix for 15 years. He wants to direct. Ah! That's all i need... another director. Uh, speaking of directors... What about culley? Yeah, what about culley, for christ's sake? Shacked up with some 16-Year-Old girl And a case of jack daniel's. Got a 6-Picture deal, pay or play. What does he care? I had a lengthy conversation with him last night. I told him that j.G. Was so worried, He was considering selling the studio. Yeah, well, knowing j.G., That's not so far-Fetched. Evidently culley didn't think so, either. What do you mean? Where is he? Right outside. All right, check on sandler. Send culley in. Harry sandler. This is dick... Gentlemen. I want to recut "night wind," But felix has an ironclad contract. That's never stopped you before. No smart-Ass stuff, culley. J.G. Called six times last night, And if we don't do something damn quick, All hell's gonna break loose. Harry! Where the hell could he be having lunch At 10:00 in the morning? I don't think you grasp The seriousness of the situation. All right. Hang up. Nobody knows where he is. I want you to get felix to agree to recut the film. Tell him you've got some good ideas. I want to put out a story That we're recalling all the prints And felix is going to make some drastic changes. Get it called in to j.G. At 6:00. Give him my regards. Now, unless you've got something that can't wait Until the 3:00 meeting, thank you. Hello? Did i wake you up? Oh, hi, darling. No, you didn't wake me up. It's a wonder. You really wore me out last night. You were fantastic. You were pretty fantastic yourself. Listen, i, uh, i like your suggestion. Sam marshall and you make good chemistry, And he's right for the part. Mm. What did you say? Oh, nothing, nothing. Um, that's great. So i'll see you tonight, huh? I miss you. Yeah. Bye. Bye, darling. You son of a bitch. Well, he liked my suggestion. He thinks you'll be great for the part. * you can go to extremes... * * you can laugh at your dreams... n' Hi. Hi. Ladies. Oh. What a great car you have. Where you headed? That depends. Where are you headed? You're late, ben. I know that, dear boy. What's up? They're all waiting for you. That doesn't answer the question, dear boy. That's because i'm not your dear boy, benny. Man: as soon as we file for divorce, It's a matter of public record. Polly reed already has her nose in the wind. Sally, you could not have picked a worse time. As your press agent, i agree, But it wouldn't be a good time if "night wind" was a big hit. Like it or not, you have an image. They have newspapers to sell. Imagine what they're gonna say After they've finished all the nice things They write about you. You know this town, sweetie. You could smoke dope And end up going steady with your afghan, And you're just one of the gang. But you, you're peter pan. "Night wind" is a fact. We have to convince people it wasn't your fault. Anybody can fail, even sally miles. No! That was felix's responsibility. You walk out on him now, And those fans of yours are gonna hate your guts. Especially the ones that criticized you When you married him. Those snakes will be the first. Not even a legal separation? Absolutely not! Shit, no! Are you out of your mind? Damn. Sorry. That water's cold. Take it easy, ladies, while i check things out. Harry? Felix? Sally? Anybody home? * on your back * * i'm a hustler * * the way you smoke that big cigar n' * to show the world the man you are * * i'm a hustler... n' Good morning. Good morning. Aah!Aah! M' don't try to prove you'll survive... n' Culley? Culley, there was a man out there with a rat... This giant rat! * yeah, i'm a hustler * * baby, i'm a hustler * * i get tired of men... * Good morning. It's not such a good idea To sit in here with the motor running. I better turn off the ignition. Woman: oh! Come on. Hurry up. Take it easy. Oh, my god! Sorry. Culley just called. Felix tried to kill himself. Just thought you'd like to know. Culley: i can be reached at that number Or this one here. Okay, fine. I think that about covers it. I appreciate the coffee. Thank you very much. Nothing, nothing. Culley? Can i borrow a bathing suit? There must be some spares in the upstairs dressing room. If i can't find anything, What are the laws on nude sunbathing? I'd have to come back and arrest you. Bet i could talk you out of it. Bet she could, too. I may drop by a little later and check on mr. Farmer. Yeah, do that. There are liable to be some reporters nosing around. Look, the only person i know Who likes reporters less than i do is the chief. They stick their noses in the wrong place, They get stepped on. Oh, and tell mr. Farmer If he ever does a movie about the cops, I got enough stories to fill a steamer trunk. And none of that "serpico" crap... the real cops. See you later, mr. Culley. Culley: okay. Jeez, i don't believe it! Traffic's jammed up all the way to topanga. Took me an hour and a half to get here from the studio. How is he? Compared to what? Gary said that felix drove his car... I told gary to tell sally Not to take an ad out in variety. Lila, this is ben. Ben, lila. Maybe felix did try to kill himself, But it's sally that's gonna suffer. I couldn't find a bathing suit. Babs, this is ben. I'd like to nude-Sunbathe, But i don't wanna get busted. Darling, you already are busted. Then you think it's all right? I think it's a wonderful idea. Great! Here goes nothing. If that's her idea of nothing, Can you imagine her concept of something? Culley, you're a dirty old man. * oh, moon of monaco * Hi, doc. How is he? Hey, ben. How is he? Why is it nobody ever asks how the doctor is first? Did it ever occur to you That i could be sicker than the patient? Irving, i'm sorry. Felix will survive, But for all you know, imight be terminal. Thank god i'm not a surgeon. Can you wait until i mix you a drink? Barely. Felix is gonna be all right, isn't he? He'll be fine, But i'm not so sure about you, ben. You look like 180 pounds of condemned veal. Why don't you let me give you a vitamin shot? No, none of your shots, thank you. Ooh, you never know. It might help. Come to think of it, Why should i give you a vitamin shot? I'm the one with the hangover. Hi, hon. It's me. Any messages? B-12... I don't wanna talk to her. F.Y.I. Only, i'm at farmer's. Crude liver... And a generous jolt of adrenal cortex Chased by a bloody mary. I thought that was a chaser. Where would salk or pasteur be If they hadn't taken chances? I gotta get a story straight for the press. Tell them you'll only be in the hospital A couple of months. Oh, fuck off, will you, irving?! Now, lila, in order to inject this properly, I have to expose my gluteus maximus. Want me to do it for you? Are you, per chance, a nurse? No. I used to be a junkie. Would it endanger your amateur standing If i asked you to use a sterilized needle? You're the doctor. Oh, that's the nicest thing Anyone's said to me all week. Hello? Who is this? Oh, hello, harry. Culley. Yeah. No, no, no. It was just an accident. Ben: oh, jesus. It's all over town! He put it in low instead of reverse, Went right through the garage wall And ended up in the ocean. Ben: tell the world! Yeah, damn lucky. No, no, it was just one of those ridiculous things. Oh, here he is now. Oh, felix, thank god! We got our speech. Felix, it's harry. He wants to know how you're feeling. No, you didn't try to take your life. You hear that, harry? He said, "i never felt better in my life." Ahh! Sorry. You know how they can Blow a thing like this all out of proportion. Can you imagine what would happen If polly reed got her hands on this? Look, we gotta sit down and get our story straight. Let me handle it. Felix, are you listening to me? I wanna play it down. I-I-It was a freak accident. Domestic problems? No way, no way. Tell the studio the doctor wants him To stay in bed for a day or two. No, i said ishould stay in bed for a day or two. He should go out, play golf, get some exercise. I know it's been a bad couple of days, And you look awful, but don't you see? The sooner we get this thing settled, The sooner you'll get some rest. Culley: no, harry, I haven't said anything to him. They just pulled him out of the pacific ocean! Felix! Look, either you come out here And take care of it yourself, Or butt out and let me handle it. I promise you, you'll be the first one to know. Now, take it easy, harry. Goodbye. Ooh, that's a nervous jew. This is a nervous jew. You don't look nervous. Oh, if you don't stop it! Don't get sore. Some of my best friends are nervous. Culley, you gotta go talk to him. In 10 minutes, that doorbell is gonna ring, And all hell is gonna... See who it is, lila. Oh, but don't let them in. Hmm. I'd like to see felix. Felix who? Farmer. This is the farmer house, isn't it? I'll have to ask. Wait a minute. It's a woman. Gave me the creeps. Describe her. Bleached blond, a lot of makeup. Oh, it's polly! It's polly! She says she wants to see felix. What are we gonna do, culley? The back door. Felix? Yoo-Hoo! I remember this scene in "the thing." There was this horrible monster On the other side of the... Will you shut up?! Hi, polly. Hi. Irving: amazing coincidence. I was just talking about you. Oh, were you really, irving? Hello, culley, ben. I hear that felix tried to commit suicide. You heard that felix... ha ha ha ha ha. "Felix tried to commit suicide." Ha ha ha ha ha! Ridiculous! Aah! He fell on her? They've taken her to the santa monica hospital. How the hell could he fall on her? He was trying to hang himself. How is he? He's okay. Polly might have a fractured pelvis and a broken leg. Ha ha ha ha ha! He fell on her! Let's get somethin' to eat. Cute dog. Heh. Yeah. Okay, felix. That a boy. Felix... For the last 40 years, I've lived a life of dedicated debauchery. I've consumed enough booze To destroy a dozen healthy livers. I've filled my lungs with enough nicotine To poison the entire population of orange county. I've indulged in sexual excesses That would make caligula look like a celibate monk. I have, in fact, conscientiously, Day in and day out, For more years than you've been In this best of all possible worlds, Tried to kill myself, And i've never felt better in my life. So if you're really gonna end it all, I can show you a half dozen great ways to do it. What did you give him? Oh, a pinch of this, a dash of that... Sometimes referred to in the trade As a "sleeping beauty boilermaker." Take no notice if he begins to levitate. It's a common side effect. Lila: culley! Culley! Yeah? I'm starved. What do i do about dinner? What do you normally do about dinner? Eat. Well, why should tonight be any different? And we're out of vodka. Jesus, irving. I just opened a new fifth. Then it's only fair that i open the next. I'll get it. Hello? Yeah, just a minute. For you. This is dr. Finegarten. Where's culley? Upstairs. Oh, god! Okay, put her through. Culley, i just got back from the hospital. Watch the hole. How's polly? Broken arm, fractured pelvis, Screamin' her lungs out at everybody, Reporters all over the place... sheesh! Felix? Felix? What's the matter with him? Dr. Finegarten's magic needle. Well, i've seen week-Old corpses That look healthier. But not happier. Felix! Believe me, mrs. Zuckerman, there's nothing serious. Come on, lila. I'll take you to the market. Right. Just keep taking the medicine. Tomato juice. And lots of water. Doc, doc. Good. Excellent. And no spicy foods. No, that's spicy, mrs. Zuckerman. In a couple of days, if it isn't better, You drop in the office. Right. Right. Right. Goodbye, mrs. Zuckerman. Dr. Herb, i have got to talk to felix right now. Go ahead and talk to him. He doesn't even know i'm in the same room! Oh, well, if you want answers, You better wait about, uh, nine hours. Nine hours?! Farmer residence. Who's calling? It's david blackman. Say hello.

Hollywood gossip columnist Was seriously injured today While visiting the malibu home of film producer felix farmer. According to reports, Mr. Farmer fell from his second-Story bedroom And landed on miss reed, Who was then rushed to the malibu hospital, Where she's reported to be in satisfactory condition... "Satisfactory," shit! Farmer was involved in a bizarre accident... Hi! Ohh. And sank into the malibu surf. How do you feel? How do i feel? Jesus, willard! In the 14 years we've been married, You've asked some pretty stupid questions, But how do i feel really takes the friggin' cake! It's just a hospital-Type question. Then you're a hospital-Type moron! How do i feel?! Look at me! I feel marvelous! I thought maybe after dinner, we'd go dancing! Oh, where is that friggin' nurse? I dropped by the farmer's market And got you some fudge. I'm surprised it wasn't a trampoline. I'm in a lot of pain, and i want another shot. I'm sorry, miss reed, But i can't give you another shot until 9:00. That's two hours! L'm sorry, but the doctor... I'm in agony, and you're sorry?! You get on the phone with the doctor right now And you tell him I need something for my pain right now Because i'm in agony and... Aah! Who are you? That is the marquis de sade, And he has nothing to say about it, But you'd damn well better listen To what i'm telling you. I'll see what i can do. You do more than just see , missy! You do, see?! Willard... I feel just terrible. Ohh. I just hate being in this horrible hospital. It'll be all right, sweetheart. No, it won't. Sure, it will. No, it won't! And you're not making matters any better Just hanging around here making me nervous. I thought that i might be able to help. You wanna help? Run down to malibu. Drop in on felix. See what the hell is going on. You mean now? No, next month. Of course now! My god. A simple little favor. You'd think i was asking for the friggin' moon.

Culley! Culley! Culley! Ahh! I just saw sam marshall! Well, how is he? Do you know him? Mm: Oh, my god! Here he comes! Hey, culley. Sam, how are you? Hey, you living on the beach now? No, just visiting. Hey, well, why don't you drop by the house? I'm having a little birthday party. Congratulations. Thank you, but it's not mine. Oh? Whose is it? I don't know, but it's gotta be somebody's, right? So you're invited. I'd like to, but, uh, hey, i've got an idea. You know felix farmer, don't you? Sure. We're practically neighbors. Well, he's kinda down in the dumps... Needs cheering up. Look, if mohammed can't go to the party, Then the party will go to mohammed. You never know. It might be his birthday. Are you having problems, darling? Uh, lila, sam. Sam, lila. Hello, lila. Uhh. Culley! It's nothing. She's just a big fan. Help me get her up. Are you sure? Yeah. Come on. O kay. See you on the beach, huh? Sure. Sure. You feeling better? So, what do you do? I breed armadillos. You enjoy your work? Not especially, But the armadillos sure get a kick out of it. Is it profitable? Only in the spiritual sense. A wise man once said, "make an armadillo smile, And the world is your oyster." At one time, i considered breeding oysters, But it just didn't sound right. "Make an oyster smile"... ..."and the world is your armadillo." You can see the problem. Mm: Drink this for me, will you, please? Culley, why haven't you called? Your line has been busy. I even had the operator check it out. I want to talk to felix right now. Upstairs, first bedroom on the left. Want a drink? No, i don't want a drink till i talk to felix. Culley, what's he want here?

Culley! It's for you. Hi, mr. Culley. Gentlemen, come in, come in. We thought we'd stop by. Good. Nothing like a uniform to keep an orgy organized. You're kidding. Oh, bribe you, maybe, but kid you, never. Your attention, everyone. Hey! Hey! Officers buchwald and sutherland. This a bust? Of course. But you got six hours To try to talk them out of it. * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday, dear somebody * * happy birthday to you * Did you find out anything about sam marshall? Yeah. He's asking a million against 10% of the gross, And that's double what he got on his last picture. His last picture was a big hit. It wasn't that big. I don't even want to talk about it. O kay. Look, this picture is important to me. You can't expect me to... David, if you don't want to talk about it, let's don't. Woman: telephone, mr. Blackman. Thanks. Yeah? He's upstairs under heavy sedation. That's right. Well, i'm gonna stick around for a while In case he comes out of it. What? Sam marshall's having a birthday party. Work on marshall. Iwant him for "killing ground," But not at a million against 10%. All right. What's the limit? Half a million against 5%. All right. Great. Great. Uh, i'll see what i can do, okay? Whoo! * tomorrow morning n' * i'm changing my appeal * * into the fast lane n' * into the sun * * under the bright lights * * i play the... * * tomorrow morning n' * oh, the start of a new day n' M' i feel my spirit wash over me n' * tomorrow morning... * Hello? It's for you, sam. Yeah. He gave benson orders to work on you. He absolutely won't go for a million, But he will settle for $750. Uh-Huh. Uh, look, let me, uh, Let me give you a call in the morning. Yeah, i miss you, too. Bye. Mmm: Ha ha ha! Whoo-Hoo! I got it! Whoo-Hoo! Sex, culley! That's the answer! We'll give them a $40-Million Pornographic love epic! Whoo-Hoo! He's gone berserk. He says he knows how to make "night wind" the biggest grosser In the history of the entertainment business, And he wants to meet you at the studio right now. Polly wolly doodle! Felix, you can't go to the studio. What would david blackman say? Ahh! Damn it! What the hell did you do to me? Why are you kissing me? It could be your one chance to recoup all the... Man: ahh! Oh, my god! Willard. I'm so sorry. Call a doctor! He's on his way. I gotta go. I'll get him. Why are you going? Don't go! Don't go! Why are you going? Don't pull on the leg! Oh! Don't pull on my leg! Get the goddamn dog out of here! Take it easy, benny. Th e party's over. * lullaby and good night * See you in a couple of days. Willard: get that goddamn dog out of here! Have you seen him? No. What is this all about? I don't know. What happened to you? If i told you, you wouldn't believe me. Felix? Where the hell is he? I don't know, but he said he was gonna be here. Felix? Felix. Felix. Felix? Felix: n' fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay * * for i'm goin' to lou'siana for to see my susy anna n' M' singing polly wolly doodle all the day n' What the hell is... She remembers the song. What does it mean? A childhood trauma buried deep in her unconscious. Her dying father, her lying mother, The final piece of the jigsaw. She's emancipated. But we blew it! We didn't grab 'em! Why? Do you know why? L'll tell you why... Because dying fathers and lying mothers Are a dime a dozen these days. Home and family have become civilization's antiques, Along with the flag, sunday school, Girl-Scout cookies, c.B. De mille, and virginity. We gave them virtue. They want vice. We sold them schmaltz. They prefer sadomasochism. Instead of the american dream, It should have been the american wet dream! We'll reshoot. We'll make frigid businesswoman gillian west Nymphomaniac executive. Packard dehibbert, rugged male chauvinist, Is really a transvestite. The dream sequence will become erotic orgies. Felix. It is perfect! It is a 20th-Century sodom and gomorrah, And in the end, God turns gillian into saltpeter! Felix, for god's sake... Think of it, david. Like the phoenix rising from the ashes, "Night wind" will become the greatest moneymaking film In motion picture history. Today, a $30-Million flop. Tomorrow, a $40-Million box-Office champion! $40? A month to rewrite. Another $10 million? Maybe 11. No more. You expect me to put up another $11 million For what is maybe the worst piece of crap That i have ever seen in... Crap?! Now, i'll tell you what you're gonna do, And i'll tell you what you can do... You're gonna recut "night wind" Exactly the way i tell you to cut it. Never! Then, by god, if it's the last thing i do, I'll fix it so you never do another picture in this town As long as you live! Ow! Oh, my god! Get him off the lot! I'll have you arrested! You are a maniac! Go on. Have me arrested. I still own 150,000 shares of capitol films, And next month at the annual meeting, We'll let the stockholders decide who's the maniac. You think when the stockholders hear That you personally cost the company $30 million... Me, personally? It's your film... a felix farmer production. And who okayed the script and budget? Who's responsible for going $12 million over budget? I put a gun to your head, And said, "give me another $12 million Or i'll blow your brains out"? You think i wanted to spend the extra $12 million? It's your fault we fell behind schedule! Then why didn't you fire me? He didn't fire you Because he's a decent human being, that's why. Fire me, he's got no fall guy. Felix, you're finished. You're through. Contract or no contract, I am going to cut your picture, And you can go ahead and sue. Go ahead. Cutting won't help. If you won't let me reshoot it, sell it to me. Blackman: what did you say? I'll buy "night wind." How much do you want? Benson: he's crazy. Blackman: yeah, but he's got the first nickel he ever made. You serious? Name your price. What do you think? I don't know. I'm telling you, he's nuts. He's not responsible for what he's saying. Then we gotta make sure that we cash the check Before they lock him up. We got $30 million, Plus prints, advertising, and interest. I can raise $20 million. Forget it. You can tear up my contract... Three pictures, pay or play, plus a gross percentage. $20 million, your contract, and your capitol stock. No, no, no. I'll only buy if i can reshoot. My stock will just about cover that. Good night, felix. And don't forget to turn off the lights. * fare thee well, fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay * * for i'm goin' to lou'siana for to see my susy anna... * $18 million, contract, and stock. 16. Get the lawyers. Whoo-Hoo! * singin' polly wolly doodle all the day n' Ha ha ha! A major studio executive told me this morning That felix farmer paid capitol studios $35 million For all rights to "night wind," starring his wife sally. "Smiles," to her close friends, isn't smiling this morning, Probably because Under the california community-Property law, Half of that $35 million is hers. If felix doesn't make "night wind" a box-Office hit, Poor sally might never smile again. This is tammy taylor from hollywood. This is tammy taylor from hollywood. Open your mouth, willard, And i'll smear krazy glue on your bedpan! Hi. Hey, what's happenin'? Sell it. All right. Then get on the phone to geneva and dump the gold. I have to have another $5 million, bill. No. No. Bill, there's no time to discuss. I have to be shooting by september 1. We're in business. All right. Writers, writers. Who wrote "last tango"? Beats me. My god, culley. Neither one of us knows who wrote "last tango." I hated it. I can never remember the names of people That perpetrate something i hate. But that's the trouble, don't you see? I hated it, too. In my opinion, a discretionary judgment. But we're wrong, culley. That's what they want. That's where it's at. It's been my experience That every time i think i know where it's at, It's usually somewhere else. Come on, old son, you know as well as i do That if we're gonna stay in business, If we are to remain filmmakers In any sense of the word, We must shake off the rusty shackles of the past, Observe the present for what it is And the future for what it will become, Like it or not. Then we must make our trade of comment. Felix, as far as you know, have i ever lied to you? Never. Well, i have, once or twice... About nothing that was too important. But now the fact that i have admitted That on occasion i have lied to you Should convince you that i'm a fairly honest man, And, when it comes to the crunch, That i can handle myself With an acceptable degree of integrity. Now do you agree? Wholeheartedly. I'm gonna give it to you straight, old friend. You think i'm crazy. Well, that's a little straighter than i intended. Maybe, culley, maybe. Hey, i tried to kill myself four times... Hardly rational. $16 million-Plus for a flop, Every cent i have in the world... Not what most people would consider a very sane act. But insane, culley? What if i'm right? If my vision is valid, culley, not so crazy, A more acceptable insanity. Culley, that's all besides the point. Sane and miserable or insane And bursting with greater joy and happiness... That's the point, culley. And in the final analysis, Who says, "he's sane, therefore he should," Or "he's insane, therefore he shouldn't"? Culley, come on. Even if i'm wrong... and i'm not... I'm full of fire, culley. I'm a blazing comet. Comets burn out, pal. But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends, It gives a lovely light. Felix? Whoo! I must warn you... my hands are lethal weapons. Oh, so's your goddamn fountain pen! I'd better be going. You stay, culley. You're a witness. You lunatic! You maniac! $16 million?! Felix, half of that money is mine! That entitles you to 50% of the profits! That entitles me to have you arrested For grand theft, larceny, fraud, embezzlement, You thieving filthy son of a bitch! Sally miles swears! You're gonna give me my $8 million, Or so help me, i'll have you locked up For the rest of your unnatural life! Give me my money, felix! Give it to me, or i will kill you! Sally miles kills! Oh! Oh, shit! Sally miles says "shit"! Whoo-Hoo! It's $100 million at the box office! $200 million! Ha ha! Peter pan is dead! Long live gillian west, nymphomaniac executive! Ha ha ha ha! Not since edison, not since griffith, Not since jolson! We'll make motion-Picture history! Ah! A cinematic monument to man's immorality, A celluloid prophecy of the holocaust to come, For if god spared not the angels that sinned, But cast them down to hell And delivered them into chains of darkness To reserve them for judgment, and spared not the old world, But saved noah, The eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, Bringing the flood upon the world of the ungodly. Aah! Oh, god! Ij' oh...i...sneezed so hard with the whooping cough * * sing polly wolly doodle all the day * * he sneezed his head and tail right off * * polly wolly doodle all the day * * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay * * for i'm off to lou'siana for to see my susy anna * * polly wolly doodle all day * * polly wolly doodle all day * * sing polly wolly doodle * * all the day * * fare thee well n' I broke you, and i can make you. It's rotten, but it's a revelation. We fail that we may succeed. Now, we keep the basic set. It's still a dream, But now a freudian nightmare of erotic symbolism. Seduced in a nursery, but not voluntarily, Not the victim of her own insatiable lust, As she always feared, but the victim Of a powerful aphrodisiac slipped in her bosco. New lyrics, bob, prurient but profound. Felix, it's not that easy. Gino, new choreography. The animals are out. Somehow, i don't think bestiality makes it musically. But, felix, it's such a different concept. A different concept for a different world, gino. Costumes, agnes. Agnes, what about the costumes? Well, it depends. I mean, how erotic do you really want to go? Go, go. E-R-O-T-I-C. Go, go, go! Sally miles, america's g-Rated darling, In the b-U-F-F? Why not? Felix, darling, some of her fans Still don't think she goes to the bathroom. If you want to dramatize the evils of prostitution, Corrupt a virgin, not a whore. Wait. Just let me readjust my sights. 15 years of nuns' habits And tu rtleneck bathing suits, And now... whoo? Agnes, remember your first academy award... Garbo talks? Yes, she talked, but she went to the bathroom, too. You can do it, agnes. I know you can. Agnes... Okay. I can do it. That's my girl! What i do now? Kitchen no work. Fridge broke. Who fix the fridge? We get a fridge fixer. Fix the fridge. Then we get an eye and ear and nose and throat fixer And have him cut out your tongue. Felix had absolutely no right to do that. Gary said in any court of law... Sally, with all due respect to gary, He's very bright, but he's your personal secretary, Not you r lawyer. You mean felix can spend every single cent... No. Legally, you can take him to court. You can get an injunction for your half of the money, But the press is going to have a field day. Do you really want to go through something like that? No, but i don't want to lose $8 million, either. Sally, suppose the things that felix wants you to do Make sense in today's market. Would you consider doing the film? You mean forget the money? No, i don't mean forget the money. Of course not forget the money. But for the sake of this discussion, Would you, if it wasn't for just a cheap effect... Would you consider doing a nude scene Or getting raped Or whatever the hell it is he wants you to do? Well, if it wasn't for cheap effect... I don't know. What do you think? You're my agent. Well, dear, if i thought it was a real ballsy part And the audience would believe you in it, I certainly would have to consider it. But you're the first one To preach my audience to me, and my image. Darling, i'm the last person in the world Who would want to monkey around with your image. But if i was certain... If i was absolutely dead positive... That you couldn't miss, And incidentally, turn a flop into a success... Sally, creative judgments are not my department, But i think you've got A few very important things to consider Before you jump into an $8-Million lawsuit. Sally: now, let me see if i can get this straight. I can sue, but at best, it would be expensive, It would cause a lot of bad publicity, And there's more than a little chance That i would lose. On the other hand, i can do the film, And please, god, felix is right And it's a success, Then i would get my $3 million back Plus half the profits. That's the least you would get. Oh, i think we can guarantee you A deal better than that. Let's say 100% of the profits. I mean, what the hell is felix gonna do? I don't know about any of this. Look, you just go ahead And make the best deal you possibly can, okay? Then you'll do the picture? What choice do i have? I'll get the car. All right, clive. You know, i'm really surprised That miss miles decided not to sue. I was talking to a lawyer friend of mine The other night, And he thought miss miles had an excellent case. She'd have no trouble at all If she decided to sue mr. Farmer. Okay. Why don't you suggest to miss miles That she discharge me And get your friend to represent her? He also mentioned That your firm represents capitol films. That must make it very hard For you to remain impartial. Are you suggesting That i might be inclined to favor capitol's interests? Yes. Uh, herb. Gary. It is gary, isn't it? Yes, yes. Uh, tell me. Have you suggested any of these things to sally? Not yet. I wanted to know What you had to say about it. Oh. Well, what if i said, gary, that i thought You were much too bright a young man To just be a personal secretary? I'd say i agree with you. I think you'd make a hell of an agent. I think i'd make a better producer. Now, i'm giving a little party friday night. David blackman will be there. Oh, i'd enjoy meeting mr. Blackman. I'm sure you would. All right. 8:00. Dress casual. Mr. Blackman's office. Man: give me blackman! Yes. One minute, please. Yeah. Woman: overseas from mr. Metzig. Hello, j.G.? Yes, j.G. Yes, i've seen it. The newsweek article. Yeah. Yes, j.G. Yes, it is getting a lot of publicity. Well, why should i get into it? It's not our picture anymore. No, i told you. Outright. Everything. You approved it. My god. That illiterate asshole Thinks if sally miles does a nude scene, "Night wind" could be a hit. He says we should at least Make a distribution deal with felix. Yeah. What if he's already made a deal With another company? Right. I want to get a look at that new script. It's not going to be easy. Just get it, all right? When he starts shooting, I want you on that sound stage. What if it's a closed set? I told you i just want something done! Done! Just get on that set and give me a report. I may want to look at his dailies, okay? Right. Right. Come on. It's okay. Anybody got a blanket? Man: hey, that's a good blanket. Hey, you wreck that blanket, you're gonna buy me a new one. Taylor: burgess webster is best remembered For his outstanding performance as uncle fudd In "mississippi mud." This morning on stage 15 at capitol studio, The entire company Of felix farmer's controversial new film, "Night wind," Observed a minute of silence in memory of the famous actor. Speaking of "night wind," rumor has it that today, Movie history will be made when sally miles, The silver screen's symbol of sweetness, sinlessness, And sobriety, proves once and for all That peter pan really is a girl. Yes, sir, believe it or not, America's g-Rated sweetheart in an x-Rated nude scene. * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay * * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' No!

We're on our way to lourdes. Where the hell do you think we're going? You gotta have a pass. Do you know who i am? Yeah. You're somebody who's makin' a big mistake If you think you're gonna get on this stage Without a pass. It's no use. I can't do it. I thought i could, but i just cannot. Culley: sally... No, culley. Sweetheart, will you please... No, felix. No, no, no. There is no way in god's earth That i am gonna bare my... ha!... Out there on that stage. I thought i could. You can, you can. My mind says yes, but my body says no. I know what it means to the film. I know it means that i'm not being a trouper And things like that, but it's out of my hands. I'm helpless. Sally, we'll clear everybody off the sound stage. We'll set the lights, turn the camera, Everybody will leave. What about the guy in the jack-In-The-Box? We'll blindfold him! Nobody will see. My public will see! My children will see! It will be r-Rated. They won't even let them in! But they'll know! Don't you care if they know? God, felix, they're your children, too. Sophia loren has children. I hear she's a wonderful mother. She would never do anything to hurt her children, And god knows the public has seen her... Oh, i know. Glenda jackson. A fantastic mother. Vanessa redgrave. You'll never find a better mother. Somebody who's not english. Ben: jane fonda. Shirley maclaine. Liv ullmann! Liv ullmann! Liv ullmann? I think so. Liv ullmann. I don't think there's anything in this contract... I want to know where we stand legally. He can't hire outside security, But he can close the stage. He must at all times comply with the existing... Wait a minute! Morning, richard. How's the old prostate? Oh, god. Wait a minute. Shit. Don't you move me, you clods! Now, you listen to me, You penny-Ante, pea-Brain, junior g-Man. If you know what's good for you, You better get on that phone and tell mr. Big shot farmer That i said he better let me on that stage Or i'll crucify him in 150 newspapers Every day for the rest of his useless life! Hello, polly. Irving! You look like an anemic turtle. You're gonna let that shyster on?! I could sue you for calling me that, polly. A shyster is a disreputable lawyer. I'm a quack. You better tell felix i'm out here! David! David. This maniac insulted me And physically prevented me From going through that door. Okay. I'm david blackman. I run this studio, And i'm ordering you off the lot.

It takes approximately 25 seconds For a shot to travel from stern to stem. Of course, the time can vary two or three seconds According to the heart rate, height of the patient, And the amount of gluten. Muscle Into which it was injected. Also, there's the matter of drug potency To be considered. You should be feeling it about, uh, now. Oh? Unh-Unh. Mm-Hmm. Ahh. I suggest you sit until you get your sea legs. Can she work? Is batman a transvestite? Who knows? I was specifically requested to alleviate her anxiety. Work was never mentioned. Irving, she's got a very big scene to do! I'm gonna show my boobies. What do you think, irving? You've seen my boobies. Are they worth showing? Well, since i can only render an evaluation Based on a completely impersonal, Purely professional examination of the subject... Uh, subjects... i would have to say That in my humble opinion, You've got a terrific pair of knockers. Hey! Well...let's get this show on the road. Set them up! Clear the stage! No, no, no. You don't mind? No, no, no, no. Oh! Easy, gal, easy. Oh, you've got some fast moves For an old john, culley. You okay? Terrific. You know, you are sexually notorious. Semifraudulent reputation, Which i do everything i can to encourage. Why? Because it's the best way for an old man to compete In a young man's world. Hey, terrific. Hang in there, culley. Mickey. Get them ready. Hi, mickey. Hi. I certainly am, right? You certainly are. * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay m' * oh, i went to... * Are you sure you're okay?

I suppose i am, a bit. The studio called. You don't have to be in makeup until 10:00. Good. I have been working rather hard. Not to mention the emotional strain. Well, felix says There's nothing to worry about. Mm-Hmm. Well, i hope he's right, for your sake. You don't think he's right, do you? If it were your film... All your money... Would you do it all yourself? I mean, distribute it and advertise it... The whole thing? No. Why not? Well, because i'm, by nature, A very cautious person. I'd want absolutely the best protection I could get for my money, Especially if it were all my money. I'll tell you one thing i'd do for sure. I'd try and get good advice. I'd pick up the phone And i'd call somebody who knows the business, Somebody i can trust, Like your agent. You're late. I wasn't sure. But you came. After all we've been through, You still want me? Not bad, felix. What... out! Out! You're not allowed in here! Nobody sees my movie without my permission. Your movie, felix?

This could mean another $10 million At the box office. Frank sinatra: * when somebody loves you * * it's no good unless she loves you... * Grazie, signore. What did you play? Sinatra... $6 worth of sinatra. Bullshit. Bullshit? Bullshit! I mean, s.O.B. Standard operational bullshit. They kill the poor sweet son of a bitch, And then they give him a send-Off Like he's some kind of a saint. And she's gonna sing, for christ's sake. She knifes him in the back, And then she's gonna sing to him? It's bullshit, culley. Probably. Well, it's not funny. No, i guess it's not. Well, maybe it should be. You want to step outside? Who are you talking to? Culley. Well, you're looking between us. Well, maybe, but you know who i mean. Culley, how about it? You want to step outside? Nope. Come on. I want to fight you. What for? You know i can lick you. Well, right, that's why. I'm so damn ashamed Of so many things i've done And i didn't do and i should have And i didn't and i did 'em anyway. Darling... I want culley to beat the shit out of me So i can feel better. But brother sinner, Even though i completely understand Your need for purgation... Do you? I mean, do you really? There isn't a man among us with half a conscience Who doesn't keep a hair shirt As a permanent part of his wardrobe. What does that mean? Well... Can you explain it to him, culley? It's not easy. There are so few people in this town With a conscience. Well, i'll tell you one thing. I got a postcard from lila and babs. I am not going to that bullshit funeral. It's hycop... Hypocritical. Well, it's bullshit! Huh? What is your disposition regarding the funeral, Brother culley? I vote with brother ben. So what's the alternative? We don't go. Ah, not good enough. Felix deserves better than they're gonna give him, And it's up to us to see that he gets it. Therefore, i propose that we give him The undeceitful, openhearted last honors Which are his due. L 'chaim. Whatever that means. You stay in the car. Who stay in the car? Him stay in the car. I don't want to stay in the car. We've got to be sly and stealthy, And you're too pissed! I can be just as ty and slealthyas you can! It's rise or fall together, culley. It's the three muscatels. Let's go. I'll be with you in a minute. You can always do that. I gotta... How are we gonna get in? We'll knock on the door and tell them you're dead. That's not funny. What if there's a burglar alarm? Ben, stand guard, will you? Man". She was accompanied By professor krishna mansak hasari, And when questioned by reporters, The actress refused to comment on her husband's tragic death. Services for felix farmer are scheduled for tomorrow On stage 15 at capitol studios. A family spokesman said today That a record turnout is expected To pay final tribute to the late producer Who was shot by police While he was trying to steal the negatives From the controversial film "night wind" on tuesday. It is ironic... Ahh! Ben, come on. Come on. Aah! Culley. Burgess webster. You'd think after all that time on a beach, He'd have a little more color. Damn good actor. You know, it's not fair. Felix gets stage 15, Burgess winds up in potter's field. At least they ought to give him Additional dying credits. You've got a wicked witty mouth. Better to kiss your funny bone with. Bingo. Good night, sweet prince. Why don't we put burgess in felix's box? Oh, brilliant! Culley, when this is all over, I'm gonna ask you to marry me. I'd cheat on you. Just so long as you don't tell anybody. Ben! Ben! What is that? Sounds like someone left a faucet running. I'm peeing. Into what? My pants! Well, as long as you're not obliged To hit anything, Pee your way over here and give us a hand. I'm gonna go wait in the car. Just hang onto felix Until we get burgess straightened out. You got him? Yeah. He doesn't have any shoes on! He's through walking. In order to make this thing work, We have to get somebody else into burgess' box. Genius. Hopefully, they'll be so busy Trying to locate the missing stiff, They won't notice the old switcheroo. Are you still peeing? No, but now i've gotta... Clench. Draw u p. Think about being sodomized by a bull elephant. You get the head this time. Don't you have any respect for the dead?! Shh! Shh. We can raise our rates after this one. Mm-Hmm. We'll bring out a whole new catalog. And we'll use the farmer funeral As a centerfold. Done. Okay. All right. Ready? Yeah. Get the door, ben. What's the matter with you? I got stomach cramps. Gas. Get the door, ben. And the seat. Get the seat. In you go, baby. He won't bend. He'll bend, he'll bend. You just gotta force him. Look, i'll push down. You pull on his ankles. Come on, pull, ben. That's it. Oh, boy. He'd be less conspicuous if his eyes were open. He'd be less conspicuous If he was back in his box. Hey. She left some glasses. Irving: oh ho ho. Genius. Ben: oh, my god. All right. Get in the back with him. Why me? Because you smell like a boiler-Room urinal, And felix is the only one who doesn't mind. And it will look better if he has company. It would be incommodious If we got stopped for a traffic violation. What the hell's wrong, culley? How do i know? Ahh! Oh, man. Ben, ben. Culley. Ben. Ben, ben. Put your arm around him. Culley: it stalled. Happens occasionally. Act nonchalant. Talk to him. Talk to him. Read any good books lately? Nod his head. I think it's flooded. It will have to sit for a minute. Okay. Let's go. How's your heart? "Nod his head." I could... You had to do something. I did do something. I shit my pants. * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy fay * * for i'm goin' to lou'siana for to see my susy anna * * singin' polly wolly doodle all the day * * fare thee well n' * fare thee well n' * fare thee well, my fairy... i ♪ They do this all the time in ireland. They never heard of "polly wolly doodle" In ireland. I mean a wake. Awake... Or asleep. * perchance to dream * * when you're feelin' blue * Oh, i'm sorry. Ben! Do you realize in a matter of a few hours, You have demonstrated Most of your excremental bodily functions? I haven't sneezed. A sneeze is expiatory, not excremental. * dream * * that's the thing to do * Now that you mention it... Did i mention it? The thing to do. Oh, yeah. It is now exactly, By my split-To-The-Second accurate Solid-Gold wristwatch, presented to me by... Our late, great host... To our late, great host. A sweet soul adrift in a sea of sour grapes. A sea of sour grapes? Think about it. ...exactly 4:30. * and the dawn comes up like thunder * Time to make decisions. You're right about one thing, doctor. He's a sweet soul. Oh, my god.
