Miss, I don't believe there is a problem. In this dish, the saffron is mixed with the sausage, to let the semi-dried sausage absorb the flavor of the saffron flower. Putting in a fully dried sausage and a fully dried turnip in this dish... You are the head chef. You should know better than me. The fully dried sausage has 372 calories, while a semi-dried one only has 285. Nowadays, it's all about low fat-dining. You charge us prices this high, and you let us eat like we're eating at McDonald's, with that same risk of getting fat? Can you see the difference yet? How about we offer you a bottle of wine? Go on, then. Wow, you are one sharp food critic! You know so much indeed! Cheng... What's your name again? Cheng Yumeng. Melissa, where did you meet your friend? From now on, whenever we eat out, you have got to bring her. My dad is opening a new restaurant for me. She writes a column for the magazine, Chic. So I hired her to help me plan the menu. What happened to your previous coffee shop? You're throwing it away? I am so done with that, too much trouble. The location I chose wasn't good. There were always these lowlife office clerks coming in. You could sell them a cup of luwak, but they wouldn't be able to appreciate the difference. Oh, recently, I've been wanting to trade my Porsche for a Maserati. That's not cool at all. Oh, where do you live? I can give you a lift. It's fine, my company arranged a car for me. Hey, not bad. Well, she is a writer after all! Miss? Miss? You booked the car for only one hour, yes? Well, it's almost time. What do you want to do? It's 300 for an hour, right? Yes. Count the money. And please drive another five minutes, then drop me off at the metro station ahead. Okay. ENTRY FROM OTHER SIDE SHANGHAI SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MUSEUM Chief! Regarding the Tuscany cuisine story, why did I receive a notice that I'm not going anymore? The Tuscany story has been canned. How's that possible? Didn't we plan it for some time already? We changed it to open sea fishing in New Zealand. And? The sea fishing in New Zealand was organized by some rich kids. It's a trip they've wanted to go themselves. To the right a little bit. -It should be to the front a little bit! -Oh, a little to the front. The father of one of the kids has a big advertising budget to spend on the magazine. So he asked me, whether we could give these kids some positive coverage. The kind that shows off their high self-esteem, or better yet to have a charity angle. In... In exchange, he is willing to double his spend on the ads with us. How can I turn down a business like that? Thank you. Originally, management decided that having the fishing article as a cover story is enough, and we don't need to send anyone abroad anymore. But I still went to the boss, and said, "It hasn't been easy for Cheng. She even had to rush her passport application." We should at least give her an overseas assignment. So, where are you planning to send me? An exceptionally wonderful place. Which is? Pokhara. Well, from the sound of it, it doesn't seem too far from Tuscany? No, it's not too far. Pokhara is a nice tourist city in Nepal. Nepal? What would I do in Nepal? What's wrong with Nepal? The air there is so fresh and things are so cheap! And the snowy mountains... It's practically the Switzerland of the East. But Chief, I worked so hard for Italy. I've been preparing for the past three months. And now, you suddenly want me to go to Nepal. Even if you make the place sound amazing, it's still a far cry from Tuscany! It's really not fair! Oh, Cheng... How much more must I nurture you in order for your level of understanding to be the same as mine? You want to talk to me about fairness? You want fairness? Go out, downstairs, to the right, another 500m ahead, there's the People's Court. Over there, you will find what you want! Even if I let you go to Italy, with your situation, you may not even get a visa. European visas are so hard to get. A girl like you, coming from a small town with no house, no car, and your savings... I know it's your privacy, and I have no right to ask. But I'm guessing it's not much. The visa officer will interrogate you so much, you will be too embarrassed to go. Why would you want to go through that? But Nepal is different. You pay a small fee, and you get the visa. You retain your dignity. And what's more, Nepal's happiness index is really high. If you go, we will have a story that matches the theme we want to cover Cheng, I think your happiness index is extremely low. Nepal would be great for you. It will be a blessing in disguise. Let your soul breathe some air, let your tension unwind a little. I'll give you three pages. You write there, I'll receive it here. Not too difficult, is it? I don't like to put anyone in a difficult position. If you really don't want to go, I'll ask Lin from marketing instead. That kid isn't picky-- I'll go. You fought so hard to give me this opportunity. I feel very blessed. -I was being childish just now. -Now, that's the right attitude! Adjust yourself. Pokhara can be just like Tuscany too. I AM HAPPY Is everyone here? -We should be leaving. Hello? -Yes, Mr. Wang, where are you? We've been waiting all day for you! Which airline are you on? SHANYIN COMPANY Thank you. You've done a lot Let's go, Na! Sit here, Na. I want a hot towel. Hurry! I want a hot towel! What kind of airline is this? The stewardess is so ugly. He thinks she's a stewardess. Finally, we're here! Now, we can relax. Who is picking us up? Over here! Are they here to pick us up? Yes! CHENG YUMENG I'M IN KATHMANDU, CAPITAL OF NEPAL WHICH IS 3,541KM FROM SHANGHAI IT'S WORLD FAMOUS FOR ITS MANY TEMPLES Ms. Cheng. My name is Li Meilan, but everyone calls me Li "Hot Blood." This is my first time abroad. What countries have you been to? I only remember the more interesting ones. For example, Tuscany in Italy. There, the food is great and the lifestyle is fantastic. I felt like my soul was no longer polluted. Instead, I was inspired. I remember when I was there, I lived nearby the forest. I could just walk over. I took a walk there every morning to explore. You know the truffles that cost a fortune back home? -Yes. -A real delicacy. They can be found all over the forest! You can pick however much you want! On the contrary, I don't really like Southeast Asian countries. Maybe it's because the visa is so easy to get, tourists from China are everywhere! Okay, let's experience the beauty of Nepal! Let's walk this way. There is a Buddhist temple here. This is the Temple of Swayambhunath. -Take your hand off. -Okay! LISTEN TO YOUR HEART FEEL THE GOODNESS OF THE WORLD I'M IN NEPAL THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH ISN'T IT THE CLOSEST PLACE TO HEAVEN? A HEAVEN WITHOUT POLLUTION Too expensive, I don't want to buy it! No, I don't want it, bye! -What are you looking at? -Mr. Wang, he is not staring at you! YOU SHOULD EXPERIENCE NEPAL WITH YOUR HEART Is this Monkey God very smart? -Can it help my son make it to university? -They say Hinduism really works. Do you think we can get their amulets? I'M ANXIOUS TO TRAVEL AS WELL I killed a life. That's not illegal here, is it? Hurry! Over here! Coming! What a pretty hotel garden. Yes! Look, they even have a pavilion! Are we supposed to practice yoga here? This is called "Yoga for the Soul," it's of an even higher class. It's also more expensive Do we have to pay extra? It's included in the tour package. Very good! Sun! There's a good spot here! Fatty, don't rush. Take it easy. It smells! Oh, it smells! Yes, what's that smell? Whose foot smells so bad? It's yours, isn't it? My feet don't smell! It smells so bad! What in the world can smell this bad? Look at my beads, aren't they nice. Very nice. Welcome! Please join me in a spiritual journey to enlighten our souls. First, let me ask everyone a question. Did you all follow the compass in your heart to come to Nepal, a country of spiritual enlightenment? -Yes. Of course -Yes. Ms. Cheng, why did you come to Nepal? I was supposed to go somewhere else, but it didn't work out. So now I'm here in Nepal. Everyone knows this tour package is cheap. My teacher says that is called "fate." -Fate, yes. -Yes. And Mr. Wang? What? Why did you come to Nepal, Mr. Wang? Why did I come to Nepal? I can't lie, right? The purpose of this lesson is to allow everyone to speak from their heart. Then I'm not going to skirt around. I'll tell everyone here what I really think. I'm here in Nepal... wholly because my father forced me to. I am placing my daughter in your care now. Very well! Okay, so I had been dating this girl my father arranged for me for half a year. Parents on both sides said we should get married. So I said, why not? Besides, I was pretty much done with playing around. The fortune-teller said my father's health isn't too good this year. So a marriage would bring some good karma to help! I don't care too much about women. For me, for us real men, when we look back at our lives, what is most important? Friendship! Loyalty! Brotherhood! Who can be your witness that you really lived a full life? What can be your testament that you really lived? Only one thing! Friends! Mr. Wang! When you are all old, when you are 70, 80, when a sneeze can give you a heart attack, and you feel lonely, you make a few phone calls, and a bunch of old friends will come, hands and legs all shaking, to play cards all day, and stay over for the night. I want that kind of life. This kind of life can only be given to you by friends. You can't count on a wife and children for that. Am I right, master? Am I right? -Mr. Wang, you must not be like this. -I'm not done yet. You cannot do this. You have no manners. Hurry and sit there. What is wrong with this child? Later, when we really got down to getting married, things started going wrong. On our life path There are inevitable moments Of despair and sadness Send more sunshine And happiness into the dark So that those in despair can have hope In our lives... Why did the bride stop walking? What's happening? My dad said, "On your own wedding, you can even have your ex-girlfriends to show up and mess things up. To allow such a disgrace to happen in your life, you must have some serious problems. Go think about it." One of my buddies who believes in Buddhism told me, "You should go to Nepal! A lot of people go there in search for the meaning of life! There are a lot of temples. You can stand at the gates, snap some photos, and send them to your dad. Tell him you meditated for an afternoon, understood a lot about the meaning of life, and profoundly recognized the problems within." Master. You see, I have pretty much opened up to you at the risk of everyone here mocking me. I just want to ask you a question. I know I must have done wrong somewhere. But where? Look, I don't harm other people. I treat my friends really well. I just don't have everything in the right place in my head. Maybe, I am not that smart. To be honest, you can even call me dumb. So regarding my situation, how would Buddhism explain it? Do I carry some bad karma from my past life? Should I buy some amulets or set some animals free? The master says, "When one feels oneself is dumb, it's because... one's soul is temporarily... covered with a layer of dust. It will be fine. A day will come when the wind will blow it all away." So beautiful! This is great! This place has so much taste! This is wonderful! This place we are all at right now is the temple to worship Nepal's Living Goddess. The goddess we worship inside is a real person. She is a very young girl. The selection process for this little girl is very strict. They gather girls from all over the country when they are little. Then, they would put them in a courtyard. They would slaughter chickens and let the dogs loose to frighten them. The ones who don't cry will pass. After the tests, there are still many other selection criteria. For example, they compare who has the cleanest eyes, the length of their necks, and so much more. Finally, the little girl they selected will live in this temple for everyone to worship. She would be asked to parade around during the festivals. But normally, she must stay inside the temple to give worshipers her blessings. When this young goddess grows up, her term will end. She will receive a sum of money, and she will then go back to normal everyday life. Where is this goddess? Can we see her? The goddess is in the main room facing us. But the goddess can only accept the worship of Hindus. So after all this talk, we can't see her? Think of something, will you? It wasn't easy to get here. Without seeing the goddess, how are we supposed to brag when we get back? Exactly. Yes. Think of a way! Come up with a way to let us see her! Thank you. What can you see? Let me take a look! My turn. Let me take a look. Where is she? We didn't even get to take a group photo! We just saw a pair of eyes. Hello. Rasin, hurry! Get out! Are you out of your mind? Stop fighting! You charge us fees, and you pick fights with us? How dare you hit a Chinese! Let go! Stop fighting! Enough! You don't even know what happened! Stop fighting, guys! It's not Rasin's fault! Wang Can, you deserve it! Enough! You bully Rasin because he can't speak Mandarin well, and here you are acting all innocent! Tell us what you said to Rasin! When we were looking at the goddess, what did you ask Rasin? I heard it all! It was just a joke. Only stupid people would take it so seriously! -What did he say? -What did he say? When we were looking at the goddess, he looked at her and asked Rasin, "Can I throw something in there to feed her?" Do you all really have no faith, nothing to believe in? Maybe we shouldn't stay together as a group anymore. Look at that kid, what a shame. What an embarrassment! We're always told to stay as a group. Makes it so hard to buy things. Latest news from our station, there are some communities from our mountain districts who, in fighting for better work opportunities, are organizing mass protests. Many people in those communities feel their livelihoods are unprotected. So they want to stage the protests to gain public awareness and support. Cheng, are you really going to leave by yourself? I can't stand Wang Can and all those ladies. Nepal is pretty small, I will be fine on my own. Why did you come to Nepal? I just wanted to go somewhere to take my mind off things. Anywhere, as long as it's far from home. I broke up with my boyfriend last week. You see it in the movies, people go to places far away after they break up. I wanted to give it a try as well. Cheng, you've been to so many places. You must know a lot. Can I tell you why my boyfriend and I split up? I just can't accept the reason he gave me. Last week, we planned a date to go to the mall. He said he wanted to buy his mom a birthday present. He was late that day. But he's always late, so I'm used to it. But that day, there was a blood donation truck outside the mall. -Blood donation truck? I see it. -So while I waited for him, I heard announcements that they were asking for donations. They said, "Extend your helping hands, open up your loving heart" or something. The more I listened, the more I was touched by it. Look, I donated one full pack of blood while waiting for you! And after that? After that, we went to a counter that sells bird's nest. He bought a box. I thought it was a good idea too to buy bird's nest for his mom. But then, he shoved the bird's nest into my arms and said, "Take this. Go back and take care of yourself. Let's take a break and calm ourselves down." Then he turned and just left, leaving me alone in the mall. Later, I gave him a call. He said I gave him too much pressure. He couldn't take it anymore. Did you really give blood because you were bored? -Not because you wanted to spite him? -Really! I just thought that since I would be waiting anyway, why not do something useful like giving blood? You don't have to choose when to help other people. What do you think really happened? What did I do wrong? I am guessing, your boyfriend didn't break up with you over this one incident. You must have done many other things that moved yourself into tears, but would take a long time for him to digest. Am I right? It's the same at work too. My boss always yells at me. He says, "Li your brain is like a one-way straight street. You don't even have turns." My colleagues are the same as well. Sometimes, I feel that I am taken advantage of. But I don't understand why. Why do they treat me like this? Cheng. What do you think I should do? I can't always be like this. Don't worry. One day, we will all become people who are very careful. FIVE HOURS' JOURNEY Mom, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Sweetheart, Happy Moon Festival to you! What are you having for dinner tonight? Oh, let me tell you, everyone in the family came over to our house. Grandma, uncle, and aunt all came. They are all here! Your dad even made your favorite pork and tofu dish. Your grandma made rice cakes. All your favorites. Wish you were here with us. Sweetheart, why are you crying? If you can't stand it anymore, just come back. At home, at least there's always a warm meal waiting for you. I'm not going back. If I go back, it means I've lost. Welcome to Chitwan, I am your guide, KC. CHITWAN, LARGEST NATIONAL PARK IN NEPAL SITUATED 3,606KM FROM SHANGHAI HOUSES, MANY RARE WILDLIFE ANIMALS LIKE BENGAL TIGERS, ELEPHANTS RHINOCEROS AND CROCODILES Hello, Chief! You said the draft I sent back isn't good enough? How is that possible? I don't need you to write about how you really feel. This isn't a news article. You must be able to embellish it. You give your reader the impulse to fly to Nepal the moment they see it! What you are writing now is too provincial. It's not dreamy at all. Do you understand? But this is the Nepal I see. You can't ask me to make things up. Then why did I spend so much money to send you to Nepal? Why don't I just let you go to a remote village of Shanghai? The way we do it back at home won't work here! It would sound so superficial if I write like that. It would defeat the purpose of coming here. Cheng Yumeng, let me remind you. I sent you to Nepal for work. Can you please not make the same stupid mistakes that other white-collar workers make? I don't need to go to Nepal to know the terrible conditions, the hard life there, but you know what? They look so happy, don't they? Their eyes are so clear, their smiles are so bright. Suddenly, you feel lacking compared to them. You feel that everything you do lacks meaning. You feel the need to pursue some kind of spiritual existence. You go out of the country just once, to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, wherever, and come back not talking any sense. Complaining all day about the pollution back home, the inflated prices, the dirty eyes and crooked thoughts of people. Before you left, you were no better than anyone else. Now that you're back, you start to complain about this and that. I've seen enough people like you. Trust me, I don't need another one. Don't think one trip to Nepal, and you can come back knowing everything. The ins and outs of the world is not as simple as you think. -Hold on. How much? -Thirteen. Keep the change. You think you can act like a tourist out there, experience some village life, worship some Buddha, take some photos, and you will be enlightened? Then if I kowtow at Jingan Temple for half a year, won't that make me a living Buddha? If you can't stand your life now, then don't come back. If you still want to come back, then don't set yourself up to fall like this. Before anyone even knows who you are, don't talk about how to remain low-key. Before you know what life is, don't cry about being true. It doesn't benefit you, and it really makes others sick! The way you are faking it, and people are tired from just looking at you. -I feel that-- -It's true. You may be making 2000 yuan a month. But you must be able to write like you live on 20,000 a month. You must make the reader jealous of what you eat and what you use. Make them envy your life. Only then will they have the motivation to fight for better life. And that is precisely the reason and purpose for our magazine to exist. As for how you can write like having 20,000 to spend when you only earn 2000, that's your problem. I don't pay you to just be yourself. Who you really are and what you really think, that's not important. -The career you chose in journalism -You better get it done. -is the greatest profession in the world. -You better get it done. Because in the future, you will all be "snow shovelers" of the world. Illusions, lies, and rumors are like snow in the cold winter, covering the entire world. Everyone will come out and say, the world is so beautiful. But underneath the snow is the real world. So, we need snow shovelers to clear away the illusions. Even if people will curse at you when you are doing the shoveling, you will know in your heart that what you are doing is the right thing. So, today, on your first day of class, I must thank you all. Thank you for choosing this career. You must think like you are in Tuscany. Write with an air of elegance, like celebrities. Use more fabulous adjectives. Make readers believe you are a rich Berkeley graduate. Is that too hard for you? KC? KC? KC? I'm not crazy! I'm just afraid of the dark! Don't be so cold. Please, help me! I beg you! Then why don't I talk and you listen? I haven't cried in a long time. I remember the last time I left home, I was on the train. I had just started my first job, and I had trouble at work. I was hiding alone in the bathroom, covering my face, crying. The money my parents sent me, I had wired every penny to my landlord. When I was filling out the wire transfer form, I cried. My dad had sent me a message, saying, "Sweetheart, have you received the money? Treat yourself to a nice meal, as if mom and dad were there." Shanghai is really bright. There are lights everywhere. I thought that as long as I stood in the light, I could pretend to be strong. I could bite my lips and act tough. I feel like so many years have passed. I've suffered so much. I took so much shit, I thought I wouldn't be afraid of anything anymore. I'm not afraid. But I am still afraid. I am afraid. Can you please say something? I beg you! Don't leave me alone here, please! Hey! Now, this is called fate. Looks like you had fun? Oh, look at this! Someone's skin is shedding! Where is that ringing sound coming from? What? Listen. That's the bell on the buffalo's neck. Every buffalo has one. They're let out during the day so they can graze in the forest and cool themselves in the river. At night, when the master rings the bell, they would return to him. If one of them fails to return, the master can follow the bells ringing from their neck, and find them. That's the bell to get the buffaloes home. That's right. It's just a GPS for the buffaloes. What if the buffalo goes into the forest and take off the bell? How would it return home if it takes off the bell? Would you cut your dad's credit cards for no reason? As if you don't have a bell around the neck yourself! It's good. You would like it. Cheng, keep your passports, they are not needed here. -Wang Can, this is-- -"Cheng Tianshuang"! Cheng Tian... Give it to me! Give me! So is your name really "Happy-Go-Lucky Every Day" or Cheng Yumeng? I can't be called "Happy-Go-Lucky Every Day" because there are too many people like you around me. Your parents sure are funny. They have high standards, don't they? It's not enough to just be "happy-go-lucky," you have to be "happy-go-lucky every day"! What does your dad do? You must have got billions of dollars at home in order to give your kid a name like that! I'm warning you. Don't make fun of my parents. I'm not making fun of them. I just think, you are not living up to your parents' expectations. Shut up, okay? Stay away from me! Don't be mad! Look, I know everything about you. Why don't you just open up to me? My dear "Happy-Go-Lucky," throughout this entire trip, I realized you have a hard time fitting in. That's no good. You should hang with me. Let me tell you this. If you hang out with me, I can make sure you are happy every day. What do you mean? Look at yourself. Changing your name, acting all fake to everyone every day, telling lies all day with not a single true word. Picking truffles every day? Truffles are buried deep underground. They send pigs out to sniff them out. You didn't know that, right? How much is the plane ticket from Shanghai to Italy? Do you even know? How much is an Italian taxi's starting fare? Do you know? In this world, we don't need a "fake every day" Cheng Yumeng. We need a "happy-go-lucky every day" Cheng Tianshuang. -Right? -Then I guess I really have to thank you. You're welcome! Think of it as my social responsibility. Welcome your ass! Is hitting people not considered a crime in Nepal? Why do you keep hitting people? So what if I hit you? Are you crazy? If weren't stuck here in Nepal, I won't give you the time of the day. If we were in China, I won't even look at you. And you really think that you are somebody here? Which one of us thinks he is a somebody here? It's you! What right does a person like you have to make fun of the name my parents gave me? -To make fun of my shitty life? -Can't you take a joke? You have no right to joke with me. That's true. My parents gave me the name out of total idiotic optimism. It is the joke of my life. What you spend in a day is more than what I make in a year. Of course, my life is like shit. Today in our society, whoever is rich has the right to be an asshole. If one day, a dog becomes richer than everyone else, it can probably make everyone else walk on all fours. But Wang Can, it's about time that you wake up. You've lived an easy life without any worry about food or clothes. But have you ever thought about where all your money came from? They came from us! They were taken from people like us! Maybe it's unflattering to hear this but people like you should call people like us "Mom"! We provide everything for you so much so that you don't know how to live without people like us. What about it? You still think my name is funny? Fine. Let's leave it at that. You can just treat everything I said as bullshit! Okay? Are you happy now? I am not getting myself into a fight between social classes. You have self-dignity and self-love. It's the society that wronged you. The society that humiliated you. You have more integrity than I do. I'll leave. Hey! So what about people like us? Do you even know what kind of person I am? You accuse people like us, all together at once. I really don't understand. You said you don't care about money, that you despise people like us. Then why do you try so hard to pretend to be someone else? Why? You even changed the name your parents gave you, and made a fake name for yourself. Now, who are you pretending to be? Are you not pretending to be people like us? I changed my name because I can't be called "Happy-Go-Lucky." In the beginning, my parents wanted to name me "Heaven's Pride." But they were worried that would put too much pressure on me. Later I realized, my parent's simple wish was just for me to be happy, but I couldn't even fulfill that. Right after I graduated from school, I worked as a creative in a small company. In order to get that job, I worked day in and day out. I read all eight volumes of the Book of Shanhai. I didn't even work that hard for my university entrance exam. Then later, my boss came to tell me his daughter thought the Book of Shanhai was too old fashioned, and she wanted to go with a space and time travel concept. And just like that, everything I did went down the toilet. But while I was going through the research materials, I came across the word "Yumeng." Do you know what Yumeng means? Yumeng is a creature from the Book of Shanhai. It takes human form, but it has a pair of tiny wings. It always wants to fly but it can never fly far. Yumeng lives in the country of Yu. There are mountains there. Every day, it would go to the mountain top to try to fly a little. To try to fly farther every time. But every single time, it would fall. Every single time, it would fail. I know my name can sound vain, but the name is me. Every time I try to pretend to be someone I am not, it's so that people can look up to me a little bit. When I become the kind of person that a younger me would despise, I need someone to come and call my name out like this... "Hey! Cheng Yumeng!" So you see, I never forgot who I really am. It's lost its way. The protestors are now gathered on the main road between Chitwan and Pokhara, causing a massive traffic jam. Cheng! Hurry and get up! Let's set off, there are protests on the highway! If you don't leave now, you won't make it. -They are going to close off the roads. -Close the roads? But... I have no car, what should I do? Then you must get a ride from Mr. Wang, if he is willing. -Hurry up and get in the car! -Okay. Cheng, take care! Thank you. Goodbye! Goodbye! Say thank you. What? Say thank you to me. Thank people like me who let you hitch a ride. You can drop me off here if you want. My nature wouldn't allow me to kick you out. All you have to do is say thank you. But my nature wouldn't allow me to say thanks to you either. Cheng. Are you okay? Chief, I'm safe, don't worry. You're fine? Then where is my story? I called you the whole day, you didn't even bother picking up. You think you're some kind of big shot? You think we can have a blank page in our magazine? It's only two hours before we send everything to print! Chief, I'm on the road. I'm stuck in a protest! -What are they protesting about? -I don't know what's happening either. A lot of people are running around! They are even closing off the road. I'm trying to get out of here. Chief, can you give me a little more time? As soon as I get back to the hotel, I'll send the article over, okay? That's not necessary anymore, Cheng. I called to let you know, you don't need to write this story anymore. I've already had Lin from marketing take over for you. No! You... Don't let Lin write this! It's only going to be a couple of hours! I know the print shop always keeps some buffer time. Please give me a little more time, It's a real chaos here! Cheng, as a friend, I really pity you. I wish I could fly over there to hold your hands. But as your chief editor, if you don't turn in your story on time, then it is I who will face chaos! Do you understand? I have no choice but to ask Lin here to mitigate my risk! Chief, I've been with you for more than a few years. Can you please not bring out a backup every time I run into a problem? Can you at least give me some sense of security? Cheng, stop asking me for a sense of security. If you write your stories well, you will have that sense of security. I need you to hand me that story on time in order to have my sense of security! Everything is relative, okay? I will give you another half a day to make the story better. I must see the story by four in the afternoon tomorrow, or I will have Lin do it for you. She has never been to Nepal, so she wouldn't have as much trouble with her fabulous adjectives. PLEASE CONNECT YOUR DEVICE TO A POWER OUTLET Excuse me, how long will this road be closed off? Hard to say. Normally, it would take a day. Okay, thank you. Where are you going? I have to leave. Cars aren't allowed to pass but pedestrians can, right? I'll walk over myself. Don't be ridiculous, Cheng Tianshuang! You think you can just walk over there yourself, as if you're invisible or something? We don't know what's happening up there. You stroll over there like nothing is happening. Don't you find yourself annoying? What if someone catches you and ties you up, then put a video on the internet to demand weapon supply and other things from the Chinese government? Don't you think that would make trouble for our country? I have to send in my story today. My computer is out of battery. What's the big deal? Wait. Take us out of here, quick! POKHARA, KATHMANDU, CHITWAN Hey, Rasin. I don't know what this place is. We are out here in the woods, there's not a single person here. We can't hit the road today anymore, it's already dark. Okay, we will meet you tomorrow. Okay, bye. Bye. Rasin wants us to go to Pokhara to meet up with them. Do we have to meet up? We will just start another fight again. Do you want to do something so your dad can stop thinking that you are a good-for-nothing? Start by trying not to get punched whenever you open your mouth. Why is my life so miserable? If I don't send in this story, I'm going to lose my job. Why don't you sleep for a bit? We will be there in three hours. My life here is no different from when I was in Shanghai. But my chief editor thinks I can find happiness here. What a joke. My father has a friend. A movie director. He is a kind of an uncle to me. I really like this uncle. I think he really has a grasp on the meaning of life. He has a motto he often shares with me. I think it's so true and so profound. Let me share it with you. "Don't beat yourself up, it doesn't help." What? "Don't beat yourself up, it doesn't help." Whenever I am upset, when I feel frustrated, I think of this phrase, and my mood brightens up. You call that a motto? So if you see those giant banners that say, "fewer children, more trees," will you get so touched and cry like a baby? What kind of director is he? What kind of film does he make? Hey, don't mock my uncle. My uncle is very talented. Have you seen that sausage commercial on TV? The one where the sausages fight each other. That's my uncle's work. Classic. My dear Tianshuang. Don't fret. Your angry aura is going to start attracting evil spirits. That's right! "Don't beat yourself up, it doesn't help." Life is just seven days after another seven days. What the heck? Hey, Cheng Tianshuang! Let my two little friends sing you a song. No. I don't want you to attract the wolves. Okay! Allow Lord and Snake Princess to sing to the confused Ms. Cheng Tianshuang a classic song, "Only Those Who Try Can Win in the End" You sigh when you feel frustrated You feel a chill when you are lost Is it possible for you to shut up? Are you so cold you've gone mad? You don't like it? Just don't speak. I failed. What shall I do? Why don't we try a romantic song! Go! Hey! Hey! The beautiful view of the West Lake The days of March The Spring rain is like wine The trees are like smoke With fate we will reunite Over a thousand miles Without fate, we can't even hold hands Across from one another It takes ten years to ride the same boat It takes a hundred years to share a bed Let me give you a kiss. No! A kiss! Stop it! Come! I'm coming To your city You don't even feed me Go! Don't push me! On the high hills there is a lady Oh my, oh my, what a beauty! Shut up! You know your mother Loves to eat baked potatoes 40KM FROM POKHARA POKHARA, KATHMANDU, CHITWAN What are these people protesting about? Why is everyone here? It is from the last time protests were engaged here. They are asking for more opportunities, better work. In Nepal, many people dream of becoming a police officer or a teacher because you can make more money with those jobs. But not everyone can have that opportunity. The chances are very slim. Let me buy you some water. Cheng. -What is that? -A flyer in English. Look! Cheng, what is your dream? Their dream is to win this fight, right? I don't think I have any dreams. How could anyone not have a dream? A dream is like a birthday wish. It can change every year. I remember when I was in elementary school, I wanted to sell wontons. When I was in junior high, I was too embarrassed to even eat wontons on the street. I was afraid the boy I liked would see me. When I was in high school, I wanted to get into a good university. It's not that unrealistic, right? It goes on. When I graduated from university, my dream was to buy a house in Shanghai within three years, then invite my parents to come and live with me. But this dream didn't last long either before I realized how unrealistic it was. So I lowered my hope, and lowered it some more to the point that I only hope I can survive in Shanghai on my own. But at this point, I realize I have no dream anymore. I can only say I still have a wish. Because if a wish doesn't come true, it's not a big deal. But if a dream shatters, even if it may sound the same, but when you hear yourself say it, it's still pretty tough to swallow. Cheng, you're too pessimistic. After listening to you, I feel like I'm losing my dream too. What is your dream then? My dream before was to be able to live like this forever. That's not a dream. That's a challenge. There's smoke over there! What's happening! Look! They are fighting! They are really fighting! They are fighting! Cheng Tianshuang. Do you know what my dream is? Your dream? Isn't it "Wedding's on Wednesday, those who show up are true friends?" I'm different from you all. My dream has never changed. What is it? This is beautiful! Hey! What are you doing? My dream is... to die on the battlefield. Wang Can! Wang Can, come back here! You can do whatever you want after you go home! Today I must bring everyone out of this jam! I'll go first, you guys follow! Ms. Cheng. You haven't figured out your problems, what are you getting into this mess for? I get it now! I don't want to change! I want to live my own way! The Li "Hot Blood" way! Na, what should we do? Let's go! Let go! Come on. This way! This way. Come on! Move! Move! Everyone follow me! Move out of the way! Let's get out! Here! -Hurry! -Stop the car! Wang Can! Get in the car! Let's go! Don't be afraid! Today several Chinese people led a group of foreign tourists safely out of the protest zone. Hurry, take a picture! We must drink up today. -Everything is on me. -Great! -Come! Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! You scared me to death today! Yes, that was pretty scary. Rasin, -come back to China with us. -A house of gold, -I'll introduce you to a beautiful wife. -so splendid -with golden bricks and silver walls. -Chinese women are very good! The incomparable blue skies, the magnificent rays of morning sunlight. The specks of white sails, the soaring seagulls... I passed by a protest zone today. Yes! Hey! Come! Let our sisters drink to you all! Okay! Come! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Drink up! -Cheers! -That wasn't easy. -That was scary! Yes! -It was so risky. -Indeed. Me too. So risky. -Never did that before. -Cheng Tianshuang. Yes. Listen to me! What's stopping you from flying is not people like me. You are already standing at the mountaintop. You're trying everything you can to fly high. As for me, I'm still rolling around in the mud. I haven't even stood up. All right! Thank you! -What for? -Come here. -Just a little more. -Hey. If one day, you do fly, when you get back down to the ground, will you come back to being Cheng Tianshuang? I am not sure if that day will ever arrive. The day I have the opportunity to fly high. Maybe you don't believe this But there are many people who envy you. They envy your youth This world is yours Just because you are young You must hold on to it It's hard to look back But do you know why people envy you? It's because they were once young Do you know the reason why People would be jealous of you? It's because they didn't hold on to it While you still don't need To think over and over again While you still don't know why you sigh While you still don't need to pretend To prove yourself What you think is what you are Look at the snowy mountains! Cheng Tianshuang! Cheng Tianshuang! Hurry up with your things, we're leaving soon! What? I'm bringing you somewhere to make your wish come true. My wish now is to sleep a little more. Brush your teeth and wash your face, quick! We will meet at the lobby in 15 minutes! CHIEF: WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER WE WILL PROCEED WITH LIN'S ARTICLE FIRST Hello! What are we doing? Paragliding! Fly like a bird! Are you kidding me? I am afraid of heights. No. Come on, look at you. Yesterday, you said you wanted to fly, but you couldn't. Now I have it all arranged for you. Why are you a coward now? Hey, Cheng Yumeng! I didn't mean to literally fly. That was a metaphor Forget it! It's just paragliding, not like we're jumping off a cliff! Fly! Don't waste the money! Go! Go! You're welcome. When are we flying? Is this safe? Okay. I'm ready! When do we take off? Don't wait around, let's fly! No matter how much you want to rush ahead, or how scared you are, we can't rush forward. There's no use even if you run like mad. We won't be able to fly high. Now, all we can do is sit back and wait for the wind to come. Cheng Tianshuang! What's this? -You're back? -Ma'am.
