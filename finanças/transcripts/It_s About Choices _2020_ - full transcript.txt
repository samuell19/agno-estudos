The middle-class it's magical They sing about it Let bad things happen to other folks while they read country life strange they never part of the fight though are you a good person well we'll find out that's for sure I'm going to tell you something David pay attention okay I have a gun and a pointing it at you do you know what it sounds like what are you gonna do about it I'm swimming in choices look at you stone cold not a flicker of fear you did know all about it didn't you what do you want we'll get to that You want money you here to rob me what do you want does it feel like you are in control asking all the questions You listen to me David You try any damn thing you even blink funny and I'll shoot you you understand me David yeah just keep driving you get me yeah It's time to switch your brain on David let's see how well you understand fear let me play with your life Why are you doing this You know in the wild When a predator is hunting its prey do you know what the most exciting thing for the predator is? The chase smart prey can't do that in a big city too much traffic don't you hate it so you are hunting me? You know I realised something you are at a disadvantage In the wild the prey gets a way out It can run away That's the thrilling part it's not fun if you don't have a way out you need to be able to run Don't you think so? So you want me to get down and start running what sort of a sicko have you become doing this for the first time aren't you you don't know where to go with this didn't plan this out did you you don't know what you're doing it's okay it's alright I'll tell you what let me give you out why don't you put the gun down and can talk this through shut the fu♪k up who the fu♪k do you think you are fu♪king cab guy thinks he is the king of the world barely making a living You are a fu°king piece of shit the gun isn't my hand look at this arrogant as♪hole You have an unconscious body in your cab and you think I've not thought things out I don't know where to go with this I don't know what I'm doing just for this I'm going to ruin your day here I was thinking let's make this fair for you give you a chance get on your God forsaken miserable shit filled life and here you had to go and piss me off what a fucking prick Ok alright I'm sorry I don't give a fu♪k if you are sorry I got this on the back market it's a beretta Nine millimetre ten round hand gun more than enough to plaster your extra smart brains onto the windshield let's get back to the chase I'm gonna ask you some questions and for every right answer you get a round you get one step closer to getting away fair enough Well that's what you're gonna get so fu♪k you Is this a game to you playing with people's lives first question you find a bag of cash lying on the road let's say it fell off a truck your family's starving and you have no money to feed them you have two options you keep the money or return it to the rightful owners what would you do? I'll take the money you look like someone who would do that what if the money was for a cancer hospital I still take it you are greedy what if it was to treat 10 cancer ridden children Now I'm definitely keeping it fu♪king heartless I should put you down right here I'll still take it why choosing to open your eyes and see reality in its purest form takes courage did you know that people live entire lives believing what is fed to them are you one of those not knowing truth from lies you know that feeling take you for example naive and misinformed Threatened a cab guy an innocent man you're not innocent well it does not matter now does it You've decided on judge no jury just you with a gun an executioner this question is not about money it's about knowing the system looking at the bigger picture It has nothing to do with greed every single human If pushed to the edge can and will cross that one imaginary line that they've drawn for themselves because of some twisted sense of morality good and bad is all relative I know for a fact that you don't know that there's a time when one in 20 would get cancer then it became one in 16 in the 70s it was 1 in 10 Now One in three Can your little head grasp why simple fact is that the cancer industry employs too many people and produces too much income to allow for a cure to be found all the current research and cancer treatment is based on the premise that the cancer market will grow not shrink cancer makes too much money to cure answer me this why are people terrified when they hear the word cancer I don't know you tell me because they know that conventional treatment doesn't work they know in their heart they're living on borrowed time why has the 40 year war on cancer failed to produce any results Huh I don't know no Never wondered why there are only three approved treatments for cancer yeah cause the others don't work and these do no new therapies have been approved in the last 100 years 100 years all the brains in the world and still nothing You still believe there's no other way all the brains in the world We've put a man on the moon that takes a lot of brains still buy into the lies they want us to have hope for a brighter day in cancer treatment while our friends and family die by the thousands every day cancers is a metabolic disease not a genetic disease but why did they say that that so that you can have a customised expensive death you know what have cancer factory is an unholy alliance between cancer institutes and drug companies perfect combination of politics money greed and corruption pharmaceutical companies are no better than white-collar drug dealers you know what a smear campaign is? No? Why would you you want to believe what is fed to you These guys do it really well it's an art form with them Discredit the competition say it's the devil's doing say it's the devil's doing Call them quacks all those walks those runs marathons you think you're doing a good job by opening your wallet up to them they play with Your heartstrings with sympathetic sounds of pleeding children in your ear all those highly funded charities all the money that they raise goes to research activities that have been approved by the pharmaceutical cartels in the first place which is the same garbage the same cycle makes me sick and here you are money for cancer ridden children that too for a hypothetical bag of cash Your thoughts are truly infantile So If you still thing that I'm the bad guy you still think I'm selfish Then I have got news for you you're the bloody criminal you're the bloody problem so yes I'll take the goddamn cash you don't have the faintest idea of Who I am or what I am you don't know me Just let me go let you go we can't do that we just started night is still young and you are not dead yet fair warning David you might not live to see the sunrise tomorrow I told you this was gonna be fun you're planning to kill me then just get it over with Let me go out with a bit of dignity shoot me in the head dignity what makes you think you deserve dignity what did I do to you that was so bad that I don't deserve dignity just before you about to kill me I've never even seen you before there has to be some that's enough next question its World War two you are in a labor camp You have a son and a daughter the guard comes up to and says pick one I'm gonna take it to the gas chamber and kill it if you don't I'm gonna kill all three of you which one would you choose I choose to save the Son why in World War two they separated the men and women so Since my son is with me I can In my limited power do whatever possible to keep him safe the girl on the other hand I have no control over whatsoever I can't save a life even if I wanted to in a no win situation you have to do whatever you can after that you just let go that's why I choose to save the Son at least I can save one you know this actually happened someone before but congrats on knowing your history Thanks Do I get a medal Or my life back would you do us all a favour and shoot yourself in the mouth You talk a lot for someone was a gun to his head so You're arrogant and chatty you're quite judgmental for somebody with a gun Look I answered your question up front dint I you think this is about knowing my history I wish it were that simple choice makes who you are defines you You are your choices God damn choices never easy you should know considering you haven't pulled the trigger yet what are you waiting for trying to make a decision should be easy for you but what about the victim what do you do when you have no way out I disagree there's always a right and a wrong the battle between your brain and your heart what do you make decisions with who's gonna help you if no one's told you this before your all on your own in this hellhole people only throw an opinion at you after the damage is done forced to make a choice that's morally unbearable then be victimised by it for the rest of your life it's an impossible dilemma isn't it class dismissed witt under so much pressure normal people don't behave this way you know Come on come on ..how do I break this guy alright alright here's a tough one There's a village and there are people in it there's a group of mercenaries out to kill those people you being their hero Want to save those people so you find them a hiding spot and you take there but here's the kicker there is a baby in the group of villagers The baby will make noise now if the dudes with the guns hear the baby They are going to kill you The baby And rest of the villagers What would you do? Will you kill the baby? Or let everyone die black white good and bad darkness and light Why always absolutes? Why do people always get stuck with this I think it's pressure clouds the mind what will people think The first nail in your own coffin if I kill the child then initially they'll be glad I saved their lives Then time will pass And eventually I turn into the villian People love security They want to feel secure life is not secure you can't live in a glass box people give up freedom for security willingly it's unfortunate I'm afraid we'll never be free of that do you accept your situation or do you make your own way will others allow you there are consequences consequences for what living in the grey everybody lives in the grey you just have to accept it are you ready to accept it if I if I let everyone die Then I'm the coward to let everyone die because of a kid they're gonna talk they always talk that's all they can do lynching that's something new that they've learned thinking out of the box you can't do that either why because it's different and how can you do something that's different how is that even possible skills patience and desperation what's that the keys to creative problem-solving a fully grown adult takes about six seconds to get choked out and then die not if you blood choke them a quick nap that's what will happen so yeah that's what I'll do To the kid It should take about three seconds that way I can save the kid myself and the villagers and what about brain damage As opposed to killing it who's the heartless one now ooh where did you learn that at least you have some moral compass go to hell Calm down You are doing well You are still breathing that's a good sign okay next question You are speeding in your car on a one-way street through thick woods and there's a mad gunman chasing you and shooting at you from behind up ahead you see a pedestrian cross the road you realize you have enough time to stop the you realise you have enough time to stop the car and let him cross but because of the thick woods you cannot drive around him what would you do would you stop and let him cross or run him over remember you are being shot at look I know what you're trying to do trying to get to know me I still don't know why all these questions let me tell you something the act of killing is not a logical decision it's a cruel one it takes more from you than the one you kill unless You are trained for it unless it's your job And the way you're holding the gun it's definitely not your job You don't want to do something that you'll regret fuck regret I don't care what people think finally something sensible you don't have to worry about my soul I lost that long back I'm sorry for whatever happened you Not yet what you're not sorry yet but you will be I don't know what to say answer the question no I'm done did I say you

just have to get lucky once thank the heavens you got this cab yeah sure Does not look like is grateful David why should he be you went through a lot of trouble and it definitely does not get any easier he's driving a cab how hard can it be oh it gets really hairy really ya Like the other day I met this cab guy who had Killed someone and who was hiding out driving a cab can you believe that of course had his reasons but it's been like four years can you imagine living a life like that something that's always on the move never getting anywhere I mean of course I understand he did what he had to do at that time you know to survive but at the end he's just a victim of his circumstances you have no control over it and no matter how much you wish for it you cannot go back in time and change the past I'm sure David here has a story oh yeah mines very cool I have a gun to my head (Laughs) it was sad really he seems remorseful maybe didn't warrant that kind of punishment you know he gave up his entire life and driving a cab when he could have done so much more I'm not saying driving a cab is bad David don't get me wrong you're doing a fantastic job it's a mixture of fear and guilt guilt makes you do a lot of stupid things Like confess you don't have to Do the right thing you don't have to it's a bloody nasty thing this guilt do you feel guilty David or did they remove that part of your brain how do you deal with guilt me Guilt I shoot it in the head and buried in the backyard look at you Ice in your veins most of us are products of our circumstances Oh believe me I know what you are talking about I've seen people waste away be good at things they don't really want to do i've seen people with power be bystanders because like you said circumstances people do the more senseless things They risk their life of the fat brass Who think the world revolves around them All for what a few digits in the bank goes against biology if you ask me the primal brain you know what I'm talking about self-preservation you would go to ends of the earth to save yourself I heard a wolf would chew off its own foot if it means it gets his freedom but the way things are people go deeper into that shit it's completely against it it's mind-boggling why would you do that it's their way give them what they want how they want it Does not matter one bit what's on the ground I want it they say jump and everybody says how high expendable everyone is every single person can be replaced I mean you can do what they say forever You have to stop at some point at which point the next sod is waiting to replace and do your job better than you circumstances you should really get out I'm trying to save your life you need to get out man you you don't need to be a part of this I made a mistake by letting you in look he's innocent he I just let him go but you wanted to be just let him go What mistake are you talking about Just stop talking and let me get you out of this et me out of
