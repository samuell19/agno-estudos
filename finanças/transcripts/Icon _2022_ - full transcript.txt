And as we were leaving, we got this guitar, this blue guitar, and I was so happy. My first ever guitar. And I did not put that thing down for months. I swear, he was a total badass and bank robberies and jewel heists. Just some grand theft auto type shit, you know? I just wish I knew more about him. You should ask your mom. Yeah. As if. [chuckles] Every time, when I was younger, and I'd ask her about him and she would just shut me down completely, so. Okay. Well, you're older now. She should tell you. My mom and I are super close. We talk about everything. I mean, it's your mom. Yeah, I mean, your family's a little different than mine. Sure. - Speaking of... family. - [Sam scoffs[ Please!

I've been thinking about it and I think it could work. What could work? A family. Okay, I mean, were you planning on telling me this or? I haven't figured it out yet, I was still thinking about it but, - Ana? - What? You wanna have a kid and move to Georgia? Get married? What? No, okay, this is exactly why I didn't wanna talk about this right now. I'm sorry okay. I'm a little confused. I mean, we have this plan. Okay, we had a plan and I busted my for you to get that money. Oh, for me? Great, okay, thank you. I will be sure to get you a receipt when I'm done. Ana! I don't care what you do with the money. Alright, buy yourself a fucking hat for all I care, take yourself to Disney World, but a thank you would be nice. Wow, really mature. [cash thuds on ground] Thank you. [gentle music] [mouse clicking] [knocking] [door opens] - Yes? - Hi, Stephanie? Yes. Sorry to just show up at your doorstep like this. You may not know me, but I think you may know my dad, Sam Tolentino. I do, I do know Sam. Why don't you come in, sweetheart? [Sam] Thank you. [gentle music] [Stephanie] You rode your skateboard all the way here? No, I took the bus mostly. [Stephanie] How'd you find me? Thanks. Well, I was just reading some stuff about my dad. And one of the articles had mentioned to you as one of his girlfriends so I looked you up and saw you weren't too far from me. I guess it's pretty easy to find anyone now. Yeah. Well I am so excited that you're here, Sam. I can't believe you're here actually. Do you remember coming here? Yeah, a little bit maybe. You were just little boy, so cute. Just like your daddy. Here take a look. [Sam chuckles] I only have a few photos of you, but you can see your dad. You look exactly like him. It's like I'm looking at him. What was he like? He was something. He drove me crazy. I'm sure you're mama too. I think he loved me though. I know he loved you. You were his little boy. You should go see him. He'd like that. Can I? Yeah. All you need is a visitor's form. It's really easy, I can help you set it up if you want. Yeah. That would be awesome. No problem. I've done it a few times when I've taken your sister to go see him. What? The visitor form. No, I'm... I'm sorry, did you say "my sister"? Isn't that why you're here? No. I, uh... [Stephanie] Oh, no. I figured she would've told you. Your mom and I didn't get along for obvious reasons and I never wanted to be the... I don't know, I was in love with your father at the time and then I got pregnant. [gentle music] What's her name? Samantha. [gentle music] [Sam] Do you think I could meet her? [Stephanie] Of course, she's at school. And then soccer practice until eight. You should wait, she really wants to meet you. She's waited her whole life. [Sam] Oh, Okay. [Sam] Um, I mean, yeah I want to, I just... I have to get home soon. [gentle music] [Stephanie] That's okay, another time then. [gentle music] [Sam] Do you think you could give her my number? [gentle music] [Lisa] Okay. - No. No, I don't owe that. - [knocking on door] No, I actually already paid last month. Hold on. [door squeaking] Oh, hi. Do you know who I am? Or maybe who this is? Hey, get back inside, get back inside. [Lisa] What do you think you're doing here? [Stephanie] I just wanted her to meet him. [Lisa] You don't get to make that choice. [Stephanie] They should know each other. [gentle music] - Hey. - Hi. I looked for you after school. I couldn't find you. Yeah, I was taking care of something. What's "something"? It's actually a long story. You wanna come inside? Uh... No, I think we should talk out here. Okay, what's up? I don't know the right way to say this, but... I think we should take a break, from seeing each other, for a little while. Not forever, just... Just till I figure things out. I mean, I don't understand. What, you're breaking up with me for what? I'm not breaking up with you. I'm not. I just, I think that we're on a different page with all of this. Okay, well don't we have shit to figure out, like, I don't know, now? I do. You don't have to worry about it. If I have it, which... I don't know if I'm going to, I'm not gonna hold you to anything. You can live guilt free. [scoffs] Right. I love you, I do. But I need to figure this out by myself and probably talk to my mom. But I'll call you when I know. Yeah, perfect. No, honestly sounds like you have it all figured out, so. Sam. Is that it? Are you done? Can you try to be mature about this? Mature. It's whatever, I'll see you at school. [door slams] [mournful piano music] [banging on door] [Chris] What's up man? All right, come on in. [indistinct TV chatter] [Sam coughs] Hey, everything good? I'm trying to get fucked up. Just keep it down, man, my mom, my mom. There's a party at Anthony's this weekend. We should go. Oh yeah? I mean, unless you know, you got to do with your girl. No man, I'm over that shit. Really? That's not why I'm here though, all right? I'm here 'cause I need to step it up. Okay, those kids fucked me. And I owe Curtis now too. Okay, there's no way I'm gonna sell all this on my own. Oh shit. I can text Thomas. Yeah, all right dope. Yo, we can make a lot of money telling this shit, okay, I'm telling you. I could also talk to my sister. You know, maybe she can calm Curtis down. No. Don't tell her, okay. Or don't tell Curtis, nobody. All right, this stays between us three you, me and Thomas and that's it, okay? [Chris] Yeah, okay. Yeah, count me in. [gentle music] Fuck. [gentle music] [Instructor speaking indistinct] [gentle music] Look lady, I don't have any drugs, okay? I already told you that. We already caught your friend Thomas who says that he got the drugs from you, Sam. Of course he did. We have only suspended him for his honesty. Are you saying that he's lying? Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. You don't sound too convincing. Okay, are you suspending me or not? Huh? You already checked my backpack. Pretty sure they already checked my locker. We did. It was clean. So you're not suspended. Great, we done here? But I did take the time to call your mother and let her know about the situation. Mom. What are you doing? [Sam knocking] Hello? [Sam] Stop! You wanna bring drugs into my house? I don't know what you're talking about. The school called me, Sam. I told them the same thing, there's no drugs. Well, I went into your bedroom, and I looked under your mattress. I'm sorry. Okay, I mean, what do you want me to say? [Lisa] I don't want you to say anything. I'm just gonna change this lock. And from now on this house will lock from the inside. No more coming and going as Samuel pleases, no more sneaking out. This is fucking crazy mom. I don't even know what I was thinking. Like I thought, you know he's a teenager, a little pot's not gonna hurt him. But no, he becomes a goddamn drug dealer. I'm not a drug dealer. What, do you wanna throw your life away? Of course not. Well, you're doing a hell of a job of fucking it up right now. I'll give it back to him, right away. Okay, it's not a huge deal, Mom. Well, you don't have to worry about that. I took care of it for you. - You what? - I threw it out. Are you fucking kidding me? [yelling] Fuck! [gentle music] Sit down and don't move. You are not ever to talk to me like that again, little boy. And you are only to leave this house to go to school. Is that understood? That means no friends, no skate park, no girlfriend, nothing. Total restriction. Okay. I don't know what this is, but it's not you. No, it is. You know, maybe if you were home more, you'd realize that. Really, are you serious? Sam I bust my ass for you. Everything I do is to support you. Don't even try to go there. Mom, what do you want me to say? Huh? "Sorry for fucking up your life"? "Sorry I'm such a shitty son"? Like you're so perfect and so selfless. I never said that Sam, I don't think I'm perfect. I do the best that I can, for us. Yeah, Mom, you're doing great. As if keeping my dad away from me my whole life is the best thing you've could have done. Sam, I have told you, I am protecting you. Yeah. You've told me a million times. You're trying to protect me. What does that even mean? What are you protecting me from, Mom? He's in prison already. Go on, I'm curious. You know, maybe you were protecting me from something else. Is that it? You know, maybe uh, a little girl? A girl looking to meet her older brother. Ringing any bells? I know. Okay? I'm not as clueless as you think I am. You hid her away from me just like you did dad. I think you did what was easiest for you. You weren't protecting me, you were protecting yourself. I could have had a whole life with them in it, and you never even gave me that option. [gentle music] [inaudible] Hello? [Stephanie] Hi, I was wondering if you'd be up. I was just going to leave a message. The application is all good to go. Okay, when can I go in? Whenever you want, just call and give them a heads up. It's a three hour drive, so I'd make a day out of it. Okay, thank you so much. I also told Samantha about your visit. She is very excited to meet you. Yeah, I can't wait. Okay, I gotta run. Give me a call if you need anything. All right, thank you. [gentle ambient music] [Chris] Yo. [Sam] Yo. Yo, I need to ask a favor of you, all right? And you already owe me considering I'm fucked with Curtis. I told Thomas not to bring that shit into school, - he just doesn't listen. - Fine, fine. Don't worry, all right, I'll figure it out. - How? - I don't know, I will. Dude, just call Curtis, please. Look, that's not important, okay. I need to borrow this. [banging on roof] What? I got somewhere to be today, okay? Bro, I can't do that, my mom... Please, dude I'll bring it back to you. [Chris] Yeah, yeah fine. Fine, yeah, you can have it. That's cool. - Thank you bro. - Yeah, man. Still trying to go to that party later? For sure. - Just pick me up? - Will do. - All right, man. - I'll see you. Thank you. Please, please be careful with it. I will be, as always. All right, man. Peace. [car engine revving] [gentle ambient music] There he is. [laughs] You son of a gun, what took you so long? [Sam] Yeah, it's a been a long time coming, huh? What's wrong? What do you mean? What do I mean "what's wrong"? What's wrong? Nothing, nothing, you just look different. Oh yeah, you disappointed? No, I mean. Yeah you look real different too, okay. [both laughing] You look good. Thank you. You know, I get a picture of you up on my wall, your sister too. I'll use to wonder whether you were gonna look more like me or more like your mom, as you got older. It's funny you say that. I mean, mom's always telling me I look just like you. Nah, You look like her man. I mean you got her fucking eyes. - The same? - Yeah, those judging eyes. How's she doing? Mom? Yeah, how's she doing? - She's good. - Yeah. She's always working and shit. Yeah, yeah. She'd fucking kill me if she knew I was here talking to you, that's what I'm sure. Well, why? Because I'm a fucking piece of shit, huh? - No, no I get it. - I'm not saying that. Look out for big, bad fucking dad. She doesn't want me to fucking corrupt you, right? Yeah, I guess. She always treated me like I was a fucking piece of shit, you know? Like I was a bad guy, right? She was spending my fucking money, but I'm the fucking piece of shit, right? Women always gotta be right. [chuckles] Anyway. You got a girlfriend? No, no I don't. Good, man stay away. Women will get you all twisted up, you know? Once they find out you like 'em, it's fucking wrap. [scoffs] You know if it wasn't for your mom, I wouldn't be in here. - You think? - No, I know. 100%. I would not have gotten popped. Oh what, like why, what? You wouldn't have to do like all the shit you did and everything, right? Like you wouldn't needed the money or anything? When the do you not need money? I'm saying like, you wouldn't have like robbed people and stuff, right? Rob people? Is that what she told you I was doing? Let me tell you something, kid. Life's fucking hard for people like us, okay? What the fuck was I supposed to do? I'm no fucking pussy. I'm a fucking man, all right. I was a fucking king in those fucking streets and then your mom came along, and guess what? She got fucking pregnant. I didn't want kids, okay? I don't wanna be a fucking father, but she forgot to take her birth control. Oh, big surprise. So here I am, fucking dad of the year, all of a sudden and I did my fucking best. She got in my head, and you were around and your fucking sister and... Just do yourself a favor, okay, be careful with these women. You know, don't ever tell a woman you love her. That's when they know they fucking got you. And your fucked. [gentle music] [glass clanking] [Sam screaming] [phone buzzing] [gentle piano music] [phone buzzing] What? [gentle piano music] It's fine, dude the car's fine. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yes! All right, I'll pick you up later. All right. [phone thudding] [tense music] You all right, man? You haven't really said much. Yeah, I'm good. You sure? Yeah, bro. Just need one of these beers and I'll be straight. Hell yeah. Hell yeah man, that's what I like to hear, that's my boy, man.

I'd be better if you could get me a beer. You gotta ask him. Well, can I have one? I don't know, I mean, shit, we can't be handing these out to everybody. Well, what do you want? How about you just owe me? Little smooth. Thought you had a girlfriend. Not anymore. ["Maui" by BTMVLE Jotta] - [inaudible] - [music continues] [girl] The fuck?

What is this Curtis, man, huh? What's going on? What you think this is? I don't know. What, you trying to scare me or something? I'm trying to find out why some little that owes me money ain't picking up my calls. What you think I'm trying to come out to this little party and chase your ass down? You're done. Give me all my shit back. I told you not to involve Chris. Oh man, fuck you and fuck Chris. [Curtis] You think I'm fucking playing with you? Huh? Where's my shit? [groans] I don't have it, I lost it. - [punch thuds] - [Sam groans] You better fucking find it. You're playing with my money. And I'm serious. Next time I call you better pick up. Okay.

Fuck you. Fuck me, man? Fuck you. [blow thudding] Calm the fuck down, Sam. - Ana, Ana. - Fuck. Chris, get the fuck outta my way. [blow thudding] I said go the fuck home. Sam, I love you, but you gotta get the fuck outta here. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. [upbeat music] Hey, there you are, are you okay? [upbeat music] [Sam retching] What the fuck are you looking at? - Sam. - Get the fuck away from me. - What is going on? - Get the fuck away from me. Hey, hey, what is going on? Nothing, nothing Ana, I'm all good. You're not all good. Will you please let me drive you home. Just let me take you back. Hey. What is this, huh? - What? - What's going on? 'Cause I thought we broke up. Did that not happen? Was I dreaming? I love you, but you have to tell me what's going on. That is the only way we can fix this. - Nothing Ana. - Who are you? - I'm all good. - You're not. I'm sorry, but you are not all good. Shut up! Can you just be real with me for two seconds? You're living in a fairy tale. You're living in a fucking fairy tale! I'm no good for you, Ana. I'm no good for anybody. I mean, look at me, just look at me. I can't be a dad. [scoffs] [Sam coughs] You're wrong. You're just too stupid to see it. [gentle music] [blow thudding] [muffled dialogue and sounds] [sirens wailing in distance] It's a nice bike you got there. What, asshole? Where did you get that bike? [thug laughing] From you. Oh, so you remember me? - [thug] I remember you. - Get off my fucking bike. You gonna take it from me. You gonna take it from me? Get off my fucking bike. Hey, hey. Get on your fucking knees. - Get on your knees! - Okay. Do you have any idea what you took from me? Everything! You took everything. Now it's my fucking turn. Everything you got now. Everything. [Sam] Faster! [thug] There, there, there. I suggest you start fucking running. And thank me for not killing you. Run! Run! [coughing] Wanna fucking threaten me, huh? Fucking threaten me? [suspenseful music building] [knocking rapidly on door] Where's Curtis? - I need to talk to Curtis. - [girl inside] He's not here. What do you mean he is not here? His car's outside. Sam? Where's Curtis, I know that is his car. We share a car, he's not here. What happened to you, are you okay? I'm so sorry. Sam. [gentle music] [retching] [can popping] [liquid pouring] [sirens wailing in distance] [gentle music] - Bye! Bye, Dad. - Bye bye! [gentle music] [toy toning] [keys clattering on counter] Why are you doing this? Are you just trying to ruin your life? Next time Sam, they can just keep you, okay? 'Cause you're not coming here. I'm not doing this with you, Sam. I'm not. You wanna go see your dad? You wanna see where your life is headed? Great fucking idea. Let's fucking do it. I'm ready. [phone book pages rustling] Mom, stop. No, you're a hard ass, right? I already saw him. What did you just say? I went and I saw him. [phone clatters] How? When? The other day. I took Chris' car. What did he say to you? I don't know, Mom. Okay, I... I just thought it would be different. You told me... A hundred times, at least, and I never believed you. I'm so stupid. Sam, no. [Sam sniffles] I just thought... maybe, you know, he was doing it for a reason. Maybe he was doing it for me. Maybe I was important. But Sam, you are important. - You are important. - I'm not, Mom. Yes you are. I'm sorry. Sam, you don't have anything to be sorry about, it's not your fault. - It is. - No, it was not. I'm just like him. No, you are not like him. You are my son. My son. [gentle music] It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. [gentle music] [gentle ambient music] [Lisa] For my beautiful Sam on your first birthday. It has been one year now that you have come into my life, I can't express the happiness and the joy that you have brought to me. Before you came into my life, I didn't have any idea where my life would end up. And so, as you were born, I knew you had changed everything. [Lisa] There he is. [Lisa VO] You gave me a purpose, and I'm going to do everything that I can to give you a future. Because I have you as my son, I feel that I can conquer any problems that lay ahead of us. You are the most wonderful thing that has happened in my life, and I want you to know that I love you more than anyone and anything in this world. I know in the future, we will probably have many arguments, but I'm writing this now for you to understand that everything I am doing is for you, my son. You are my whole life. And I pray that we will always be close to one another. You will always be my little boy. My little boy. And I hope we can be the best of friends. Happy birthday my son, and always know that I love you. [gentle music] Hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to apologize. Okay, well I don't really wanna hear it. So, you should go. Ana. Please okay, I just... there's some things I need to say to you, at least once. When you first told me what happened I... I froze. Okay, and that was shitty. Yeah, it was. All I could think about was my mom and what happened with her, how her life played out, and I didn't want that to be you. Okay, I didn't want you throwing away everything that you had built for me. It didn't have to be like that, but you didn't give us a chance to figure it out you just assumed. You're right, and I'm sorry. Okay, I'm truly sorry. Thank you for saying that, but you really hurt me the other night. You said some terrible things to me. And I don't know if there's anything I can do at this point, but if I know one thing is that I want to be there for you. Okay, from this point forward, I'm going to be there for you. And I wanna be there for our baby. And that's in whatever capacity, okay? If you want me there for a week, a day, I don't care, I'll be there. Okay, I have to be. I want that too but I mean, I'm scared Sam. Ana, I may not seem like it, but you're all I think about. And I just want you to know that whatever happens with us going forward, you're not gonna be alone, okay? It's not gonna be just you. I'll keep my word and I'll be there for both of you. We're gonna mess up. Okay, I've already messed up. I know that I wanna be a dad. Okay, I can't wait to be a dad. We'll get him a skateboard and be there for his first Ollie, get him a guitar, whatever. I'll even teach him the drums if that's what they want. We can start a band you, me and him or her. And I just know that I want you to be there for every second of it. Every single second of it, I want to be by your side. 'Cause I know that you'd make a wonderful mom. And I'm gonna make damn sure that I'm the best dad. I promise. I love you, Ana. That's never gonna change. [gentle music] It's gonna be a really terrible band. Do you wanna come in? Yeah, I'd love that. [phone buzzing] Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I'm almost done at work, I think. All right, yeah, I'll see you there in a little bit. [gentle music] ["Little Boy" by Daniel Robinson] ♪♪
