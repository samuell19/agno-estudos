I can't see a thing. Nothing at all. I still can't see a thing. You're breaking my concentration! I can see now. What do you see? I see myself... in 8 or 10 years... I'm with my daughter... The good, pretty type. We're having tea with rich ladies... The sun is very bright, very hot... And then... my husband opens the door and comes in. He's the type who... The type who... What? What type? The type who... No talking during class! Get up, join the class! Why did you run over there? You wanted to know my future husband. Who is it? The one I just jogged around. Which one? The cutest one, of course. Him. Who? The one in the colored shirt. Zhang Shihao, Class 75. Want to bet? What's the bet? A 3-point shot. Dumb. A 5-point shot. Too dumb. I bet that... you won't jerk off out here. Okay, how much? 100. You're cheap. 2,000! You crazy? 2,000? Go jerk yourself off! Then... let's bet my class fees. Okay. How much? 1,200. Come see a handsome guy jerking off! Come see! I found it. You don't play basketball. I do sometimes. Yes? What? I'm revising my English. It's late. Where d'you wanna go? Don't want to. I don't want to. I'm leaving. I'm putting on my shoes. Where are you? I'm crossing the street. Hurry! Bring me back some red bean ice cream! Hello? Get up, it's dark! Hello, hello, hello? There you are at last! Where you wanna go so late? Guess. Well... Come see Shihao with me, okay? — Don't want to. — Please... — Don't want to! — Please... — Please! — Beg me. Okay, I'm begging you. C'mon! You have to really beg! Hurry up! Don't want to! C'mon... Zhang Shihao... sneaks in every night to swim. He's on the swim team. What are you looking at? I can't see anything. Yes, but you can listen to him swimming. Are you in love with him? I wonder... if he has a girlfriend. Of course he does! I wonder... if he'd like me. Of course not. So, find out for me. Don't want to! — Please... — Don't want to! — Please... — Don't want to! — Pretty please. — Don't want to! Shihao, got a girlfriend? Shihao, my friend wants to ask you something! You got a girlfriend? Zhang Shihao, do you hear me? My friend wants to ask you something! Have you got a girlfriend? My friend wants to ask you something! Zhang Shihao! Don't shout! If the campus guard sees us... we'll be punished! Was it you yelling? My friend wants to ask you something. Who? What does she want? She wants to know if you're interested. Who is she? You interested? But who is she? But are you interested? I have to know who she is. Who is she? Yuezhen! Yuezhen! Come out! Lin Yuezhen! There's no Lin Yuezhen. You want to tell me something. Yuezhen, don't hide! Lin Yuezhen! There's no Lin Yuezhen. You want to tell me something. I'm a Scorpio, guitar club, swim team. Let me see. Come on... Let me see. Come on! Shihao's basketball. I took it. Shihao's shoes. Big feet. Must be a 10. Where did you get his notebook? Ugly handwriting! He was turning in homework. I saw it and took it. What's this? I made it. You like to draw hearts? And this? A bottle he drank from. You even kept that? Don't throw it. His goggles. His pen. I've liked him for so long... I can only take his photo in secret... and go through his trash. I'm really dumb, huh? I'm going home. Don't. I hope to be your friend. Signed: Meng Kerou You can keep it. Help me. Don't want to! Come on! I won! — It's for you. — What's that? My reward? I'm a Scorpio, guitar club, swim team! "Dear Zhang Shihao, We're in the same school. When I see you, I always take a second look at... you. Every morning, I go to school... hoping to see you. I feel you're a nice boy. I hesitated a long time before writing this." Your attention, please! Zhang Shihao, Class 75... and Meng Kerou, Class 68... Report to the Principal's office. Gross! I didn't paste the letter. Mien did. I didn't write the letter. Lin Yuezhen did. There's no Lin Yuezhen, is there? You want to tell me something. I'm a Scorpio, guitar club, swim team. I'm "not bad." Now, the plural: "housewives." Look. The change in the plural form: "fe" becomes "ves" as with "knife." Why did you put my name? Why did you put my name? What're you doing, Meng Kerou? Why did you put my name? Pick up your book. What's with you two? You hungry, Kerou? Kerou, you hungry? 20 ravioli. Our ravioli is big. I think 15 is enough. Want some soup? Spicy soup with eggs or beans and tofu? Spicy soup. Take beans and tofu. You boys don't eat enough of it. You at Fu-Jong High? My daughter too. Meng Kerou. You know her? Sure, it's such an unusual name! She's as hard as her name! Didn't you choose her name? No, her grandpa did. Gross! What's today's test on? — What's the test on? — Pages 58 to 67. Pages 58... 67... All that? It's on the chapter Teacher taught. A lot of new words. — You haven't memorized it? — Not yet. How do you say this? Hurry up, it's nearly time. What do you want? I'm "not bad," "swim team"... Isn't it enough? What do you want? To go out with you. I'll make some for you. I ate and I'm going home! What do you want? To go out with you. I'm trouble. So am I. Hey, hey, hey, hey, party girl Come on the dance floor Stand close to me Come discover love by my side I'll sing you a rock'n'roll song And we won't cry... ever again! You like this music? Me too. You understand the words? Sure! Me too. Is it boring, going out with me? I'm not usually this boring. It's because I don't know you. Do you want to kiss me? What? Here? Aren't girls shy? I am. Let's go swimming. — You know how? — No. — I'll teach you. — Don't want to! C'mon... Don't want to! Come on! Is Yuezhen there? You know... I jog here every day... I drink a bottle of water and jog back. Teacher... does this count as kissing? Our lips touched the same bottle. How can that be kissing? Of course not. Do you want to kiss me? You're a child... Stop that nonsense. Do you want to kiss me or not? That's forbidden! Zhang Shihao! I'd like to speak to Meng Kerou. Weird. What does he want? — What did you want the other day? — Nothing. I know who wrote on your desk. Who? She did. You were furious! Were you scared? Know why she wrote that on your desk? No idea. She's in love with Shihao. Then she should write "gross" on your desk. How are things with Shihao? Nothing between us. So, what they say isn't true? No, not true. What do they say? Don't go too fast! I ate and I'm going home! Zhang Shihao! Don't follow me after school. Don't eat at my mother's. Don't talk to me, okay? What's all this? I couldn't love you. What's wrong with me? Why did you ask me to kiss you? Can't you understand? I'll never love you. Then why did you hold my hand? Why? Why, huh? No reason! Going okay with the PE teacher? Don't be stupid! Then... why did you ask me to kiss you? You're a real pain. Why did you ask me to kiss you? Why, huh? Why did you ask me to kiss you? Why did you ask me to kiss you, huh? Tell me a secret. Why? Tell me a secret. Go on... Tell me a secret, quick. A secret... You really want to know? I don't like swimming. I stay in the pool all day... but it's boring, all by myself. It's a solitary sport. There are lots of sports like that. But swimming is cool. I'd like to win a competition. To get a college scholarship. What are you talking about? A secret. Bull! — That's not a secret. — No? Think again. I'm still a virgin. — Many people still are. — No... Those who talk big usually are. Think again. I don't know... What should I say? A secret! All right... My pee fans out. When I pee, it fans out! Like a shower head. Never in a straight line. I don't know why. Maybe the opening is too big. Don't tell anyone! Okay. I'll tell you my biggest secret. — Where are you going? — Stay there! Stay there! It's easier to talk like this. Stay there! I'd do anything for Yuezhen. There's no Yuezhen, is there? There is. She's in love with you. And? I'd do anything for Yuezhen. I help her out. I spoke to you on her behalf. I brought you her letter. I took the rap for her. I've always helped her out. Because... I really like her. I think I like girls. That's why I'll never love you. You're a really nice guy. I don't want to hurt you. Worst excuse I ever heard. What excuse? To dump someone. Next time I see Yuezhen, I'll tell her I'm gay, too. — You don't have to believe me! — I don't. Then why did you go out with me and hold my hand? Why did you ask me to kiss you? I thought that if I managed to kiss a boy, I wouldn't be one... What about the PE teacher? He was just unlucky. I asked him to kiss me too. That's it... Maybe... if you kiss a boy for real... you won't feel like a lesbian anymore. Do you want to kiss me? Did you feel anything? Want another kiss? Are you still a lesbian? Does this mean... we're breaking up? Does this mean we're breaking up? Does this mean we're breaking up? Zhang Shihao, Zhang Shihao, Zhang Shihao... You really didn't go out with Shihao? I really didn't. Then, let me show you something. What is it? If I write his name with this pen until there's no more ink... he'll fall in love with me. Pretty smart. The pen's nearly empty. You really didn't go out with Shihao? How many times do I have to tell you? So, introduce me. I don't want to. You know him now. It won't hurt you to introduce me. I don't want to. Please... Don't want to. Please, since you know him... Hey... What if he doesn't like me? He will. Are you sure? I'm certain. Zhang Shihao... This is Lin Yuezhen. She has something to say. Do you want to go out? Go on! Okay, my job is done. Wait. Don't leave me. Hey, look... This is dumb. That's enough, I'm leaving. I'll call you. This is it. Zhang Shihao... Can we go out? Sorry, no. Meng Kerou! Who wants her? You want to see Kerou? What about Yuezhen? Where is she? Isn't she cute? What are you after? What's the meaning of this? You took her home. What's the meaning of this? Generally, boys love girls and vice versa. It doesn't mean anything else. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Look, what do you want? Look, what do you want? Don't you love Yuezhen? I mustn't love her. I mustn't love Yuezhen! I mustn't love girls. It won't work. We already tried to kiss. So... You already kissed Yuezhen? No. Does Yuezhen know? No, she doesn't. I'd tell her if I were you. If I told her... maybe we wouldn't be friends anymore. Not everyone can be like you. Life can be unfair at times. I'm sorry. What for? You're 17, and without me... you'd only dream about going to college, and not being a virgin, and peeing straight. You'd be much happier. Zhang Shihao... Zhang Shihao... Kimura Takuya... Kimura Takuya... It was a very up-market restaurant. I'd never been there before. Soft lights, very romantic... with a pianist... A scent of lavender in the air... It was full of waiters in black tuxedos, rushing around... We stayed till late... Yuezhen... Then Shihao wanted to go to my place. I took him home. He went straight to my bed and sat down. What is it? Then... my mom came home... I'm a girl, I like boys. Ignore my friends. They're scum! |don't even know your name. What's your kind of boy? It depends. What about me? Hi, it's me. No reason. It's just that... I have a competition Wednesday... I'd like you to come. Oh, and... I wanted to say... Are you crying? Don't cry. Come on, I'll console you. Look, don't cry. Hey, let's split! Let's go, guys! You're too big for that... Let me sleep next to you. — What's happening? — Nothing. Tell me. When Dad left... how did you survive? Exactly as I thought... A broken heart. The boy who came for ravioli every day? It's all right. Whose heart hasn't been broken? Tell me how you survived. I don't know, I just survived. I really don't know. You just survived... I hope it happens to me soon. Go on, Shihao! Zhang Shihao of Fu-Jong High in lane 3. Yau Zhixiang of Dong-Jong High in lane 4. Why didn't you come? Did you swim well? Terrible... Good thing you didn't come. It sucks... The summer is almost over. I haven't done anything. Same here. I just ran around. I haven't done a thing. I haven't won a single race. I've wasted my time. What's on your mind? What is on your mind? There must be something left. What's left is what makes us grown-ups. Where did you steal that line? I'm going home. Me too. I won. I won again. Won again. I won! You won. The other day... on the phone... I wanted to say... Maybe someday... in a year... maybe three... if you start liking boys... you tell me first. Don't laugh. I'm serious. Shihao, seeing your colored shirt going away... I'm thinking... In a year, 3 years, 5 years... where will we be? You're kind, cheerful, uncomplicated... you'll be even better. I can see you years from now... You're in front ofa big blue gate... in the afternoon sun... You still have a few zits... You smile, and I run towards you... You nod at me... 3 years... 5 years later... Later, much later... What kind of grown-ups will we be? Like the PE teacher? Like my mom? I can't see myself, even with my eyes closed... but I can see you. I'm a girl, I like boys. Zhang Shihao was here in 2001.
