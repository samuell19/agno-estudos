The locals here have believed in spirits for ages. ﻿Maybe even before there was any religion. ﻿But, the meaning of spirits for Isan people ﻿might not be the same as for most. ﻿We believe everything that goes beyond nature ﻿is all called spirits, ﻿not just the souls of dead people. ﻿We believe spirits are in every single thing, ﻿In houses, ﻿in forests, in mountains, ﻿in trees, ﻿in rice fields. ﻿Every area has spirits. All of it. ﻿In 2018, a documentary team traveled ﻿all over Thailand to study the lives of shamans. ﻿After interviewing many shamans, ﻿the team decided to study the life of Nim. ﻿The shaman of 'Goddess Ba Yan'. ﻿For Isan people, spirits have many types, ﻿such as Phee Fah, Phee Tan, ﻿Phee Sua, Phee Ban, Phee Muang... ﻿They're all spirits. ﻿There are good spirits that protect us, ﻿and evil spirits ﻿that haunt us and make us sick. ﻿And the spirit within you, who is it? ﻿Let me say it in central dialect, ﻿They call it 'possessing.' ﻿In Isan, they call it 'Ma Tiam.' ﻿I'm the shaman for Goddess Ba Yan. ﻿Ba Yan is an ancestral spirit. ﻿She's a good spirit ﻿who has protected the villages for a long time. ﻿Actually, no one knows who She is or where She's from. ﻿But they've paid respect to Her for many generations. ﻿'Shaman Bloodline' ﻿A documentary about the shaman inheritance in a family. ﻿My family has been Ba Yan's shaman for many generations. ﻿Ever since I was born, ﻿I saw my grandmother as Her medium. ﻿Ba Yan only chooses women to be Her medium. ﻿Lots of locals would come to see us. ﻿Every year we do a ceremony. A very big one. ﻿The locals will ask ﻿how the village will fare for the coming year. ﻿After my grandmother died, ﻿the next person to inherit Ba Yan was my aunt. ﻿After my aunt, the next shaman was supposed to be Noi, my elder sister, ﻿but Noi declined the inheritance. ﻿Ba Yan then chose.. ﻿me instead. ﻿Don't shamans have to shake their bodies or change their voices? ﻿You might have watched too much TV. ﻿It doesn't have to be like that. ﻿As you've seen, people come see me every day. ﻿Some come to heal their sickness. ﻿Some ask for blessings or wishes. ﻿Some repay their wishes ﻿with offerings of a jar of liquor and a chicken. ﻿Tell me what happened? ﻿My husband found this cobra and made liquor out of it. ﻿I told him not to drink it, but he didn't listen. ﻿His arms and legs went numb. He doesn't have any strength. ﻿Where did you get it from? ﻿I got it from the cemetery. ﻿This is the cause of your misery, paying for your bad karma. ﻿Because you're drinking the soul that resided in this animal. ﻿Can you treat every illness? ﻿If someone has cancer and they come to see me... ﻿they will die for sure. ﻿I can only treat illnesses that happen from the unseen ﻿such as black magic, ﻿or if a spirit has harmed you, I can cure it. ﻿But if it's a normal illness, I advise you go see a doctor. ﻿I never thought of being a shaman before. Actually, I didn't want to be one. ﻿There was a period when I was always sick. ﻿No matter what, I couldn't get better. It was so painful ﻿to the point that I wanted to run away to get away from it all. ﻿Why does it have to be me? ﻿But I didn't succeed. ﻿So I agreed to let Her take me. Actually, it is great. ﻿Now I get to pray every day and do ceremonies. ﻿And people come to see me, asking for help when they have troubles. ﻿Now I consider it to be very good. ﻿I'm at ease. ﻿I can't even remember why I first didn't accept Her, ﻿why I was mad at Her. ﻿SEAMSTRESS ﻿THE MEDIUM ﻿We're going to Wiroj's funeral. Who is he? ﻿Wiroj is... ﻿the husband of my elder sister, Noi. ﻿He found out last year that he had cancer. ﻿I'm sorry for your loss. ﻿I don't know why all the men in the Yasantia family ﻿Wiroj Yasantia die under bad circumstances. ﻿Wiroj's grandfather was stoned to death by laborers. ﻿Wiroj's dad, when his factory went belly-up, ﻿he burned the factory for insurance money. ﻿When he was caught, he poisoned himself to death. ﻿As for Mac, Wiroj's eldest son, ﻿he died in a motorcycle accident several years ago. ﻿Huh? ﻿How have you been? ﻿Haven't seen you for so long. You've forgotten your family? ﻿If no one died, we'd never see each other. ﻿- Is this tray ready? - Yeah, you can take it inside. ﻿- You always forget your relatives. - Can you stop nagging? ﻿He's the pastor from the church Noi goes to. ﻿Thank you for coming. ﻿Mink, please get a chair for the pastor. ﻿Mink. ﻿How are you? ﻿Your mom told me you were the first one to find his body. ﻿I'm okay. ﻿My family has 3 siblings. ﻿There's Manit, the eldest. ﻿If you smoke a lot, you can't tell one thing from another. ﻿Water? Some water? ﻿Noi is the middle child, and I'm the youngest. ﻿See.. ﻿Wiroj, Noi's husband, just died. ﻿Before this, Mac, Noi's son, passed away. ﻿Now, Noi is left with Mink, her only daughter. ﻿Actually, Noi and Wiroj married a bit late. ﻿Once they married... ﻿Noi took over the dog meat shop from her mother-in-law, ﻿Wiroj's mother. ﻿I don't know why she did that. ﻿The government doesn't allow it, but Noi still secretly does it. ﻿My sisters, they don't get along very well. ﻿They have had some kind of disagreement ever since who knows when. ﻿I've tried to talk to them to get them to reconcile, to make up. ﻿- Make sure they're yours. - I won't take someone else's. ﻿Thank you for coming. ﻿Auntie. ﻿Mom wants you to get stuff from my house. ﻿She wrote it all down and where everything is. ﻿Hello, Auntie Nim. ﻿Here. ﻿You already closed the door, right? - Yes. ﻿- Lucky won't go outside, right? - It won't. ﻿You brought the wrong cloth. I wanted the thicker one. ﻿Why don't you go get it yourself then? ﻿Uncle, what the hell are you saying? ﻿No one said anything, Mink. ﻿What the fuck did you say? Say it! ﻿I didn't say anything. ﻿Just mind your own business. Are you talking shit about me?! ﻿Who? No one's said anything. ﻿- He cursed at me. - Ihaven't done anything... ﻿You called me a whore! ﻿Mink! Stop it! ﻿Mink, don't! ﻿I didn't call you that! ﻿Get him out of here, mom! ﻿Mink, let's go. ﻿- Mink, go. Leave first. - I'm not leaving. He cursed at me! ﻿No one's said anything at all. - ﻿Dammit! Get out of here! - Mink, calm down. ﻿- Mom, let go of me! - Calm down, Mink. ﻿He cursed at me. ﻿He didn't. ﻿Does Mink usually drink a lot? ﻿I know she drinks, but I didn't know it was this much. ﻿This is the first time Mink's caused a scene. ﻿I see. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿See you around. ﻿Drive safely. ﻿Okay. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Who died? ﻿The blind old woman whose house is behind the temple. ﻿How did she die? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink! ﻿Wiro' Yas anti a ﻿Nim, what are you doing here? ﻿What are you doing in Mink's room? ﻿Why are you going through her things? ﻿I asked you a question. Why don't you answer? ﻿Why aren't you saying anything? Gosh! ﻿What are you looking for? Tell me... ﻿Here. ﻿See? ﻿Do you know what this is? ﻿What? ﻿What are you doing? Both of you get out. ﻿- Mink, hold on. - Mom, leave. ﻿Mink, you've started to have nightmares and hear strange things, right? ﻿No! Nothing! Mom, get out. ﻿Mink... ﻿Get out ﻿Get out! ﻿Must you film everything, seriously? ﻿You know what the turmeric is for, right? ﻿You must tell me if Mink shows any strange symptoms. ﻿Noi! ﻿She's my child. I can take care of her. You should leave. ﻿What is it that Mink hangs in her closet? ﻿It's a turmeric called Pa Ta Ba. ﻿We believe it can protect us from spirits ﻿and other evil things. ﻿Why the hell did they come into other people's room? ﻿They went through my stuff, too. Dammit! ﻿It's so freaking lame. ﻿Right? ﻿Why did you put the Pa Ta Ba in your room? ﻿What they did, it's so childish. They're supposed to be the adults here. ﻿At the funeral the other day, why were you staring at that blind lady? ﻿What blind lady? ﻿Do you see someone standing over there? ﻿Yes. ﻿I see someone there. ﻿Why? ﻿The team went over the footage ﻿and found Mink showing some strange behavior. ﻿What do Mink's recent symptoms mean? ﻿From what I've gathered, they can be several things. ﻿Does that mean Ba Yan will move to Mink? ﻿I don't know. ﻿The team had an idea. If a shaman inheritance is real, ﻿they might be able to record the manifestation. ﻿They decided to film Mink and her family, too. ﻿Hey. ﻿Are you going to film me all the time? ﻿Most of the time. ﻿Just make yourself com fortable. ﻿Tell me about your job. ﻿Sure. ﻿I work at the Recruitment Center. ﻿RECRUITMENT CENTER ﻿All day I assign work for people to do. ﻿Number 6. ﻿Hello. ﻿I wake up at 5 a.m. I wake up early. ﻿Eat and get into work around 7, 8 a.m. ﻿In the afternoon there aren't many people. So I have some free time. ﻿I'm not that tired with my work. ﻿And do you like your job? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I think I'm happy helping others find jobs. ﻿You're telling the truth, right? ﻿Of course! I sound like a beauty queen, huh? ﻿How do you feel towards people who are shamans, like your aunt? ﻿Shamans? ﻿To be honest, ﻿I think it's nonsense. I don't think it's real. ﻿Out of the blue, they do weird dance moves. Acting like Hanuman. It's so weird. ﻿I've also heard people say that there's a Doraemon shaman. ﻿Hilarious! ﻿What's a Doraemon shaman? ﻿Well, it's a Doraemon shaman. ﻿I guess when they're taken over, they sing the theme song. ﻿speak in tongues ﻿I'll show you. ﻿See? ﻿Anyone can do it. Have you seen those clips? This is how they speak. ► ﻿What would you like? - 100 baht of meat. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I don't know why they won't let us sell it. ﻿People around here have eaten dog meat for ages. ﻿Oh, but you sell dog meat and also have a pet dog. ﻿Doesn't it feel strange? ﻿I don't find it strange at all. ﻿Those who raise goldfish and carp, don't they also eat fish? ﻿May I ask about Ba Yan? ﻿When Ba Yan tried to enter into you, can you remember how you felt at the time? ﻿Back then, I remember I was in my twenties. ﻿I started to have weird symptoms. ﻿Locals call it 'Shaman Fever.' ﻿At the time, I had severe headaches, ﻿and my period came every day straight for 5 full months. ﻿My aunt was already a shaman. ﻿She advised me to do an Acceptance Ceremony to be a shaman. ﻿But I didn't want to. I didn't like the idea of being a shaman. ﻿So... ﻿I converted to Christianity. ﻿I prayed to God ﻿that I would not become a that I would not become a shaman. ﻿For if you forgive others their trespasses, ﻿your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ﻿But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. ﻿But something happened with Nim, my younger sister. ﻿Nim went to study dressmaking in the city. ﻿They said that she fainted and blacked out ﻿without knowing the cause. ﻿We had to go get her and bring her back home. ﻿After that, Ba Yan entered into Nim instead. ﻿No one knows what happened. ﻿Thinking about it now, I do feel guilty... ﻿Nim took my place as the shaman. ﻿And what if now... ﻿Ba Yan wants to move to Mink. What will you do? ﻿If you're going to ask me stupid questions, ﻿then you can stop asking. ﻿And stop filming. ﻿Whoa, Mink. You're beautiful. ﻿Why are you wearing baby shoes? ﻿Girl, on the parade day, you're gonna be the prettiest. ﻿Is it comfortable? ﻿It's fine. But it's a bit loose. They'll take it in for me. ﻿Oh, I see. ﻿Lisa, have you noticed Mink acting strange lately? ﻿Recently, I guess you could call it strange. ﻿It's like she's faking or something, like she's not her real self. ﻿Here, just a sec. ﻿Mink, where are you going? ﻿Girl, it's for kids. You can't play. ﻿I want to. ﻿Are you out'of your fhind? Get out. ﻿Mink. ﻿Cray-cray. Mink! ﻿What the hell is wrong with you? ﻿Mink! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Hey. ﻿Hey. ﻿Can you not film me all the time? ﻿I'm a mess right now. ﻿Stop filming. ﻿RECRUITMENT CENTER ﻿Mink, you bitch. ﻿You ditched me to go with some guy again? ﻿If you get messed up again, don't come to me for help. ﻿Mink? ﻿RECRUITMENT CENTER ﻿I'm here. ﻿Oh, Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Why are you sleeping here? ﻿Wake up. Go wash your face and start work. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Mink? ﻿Where did you sleep last night? I called, but you didn't pick up. ﻿It's time you stop drinking. ﻿Mink. ﻿What's with you? ﻿It's just my period. What's with the nagging? ﻿Wait, talk to me first. For how long? ﻿Mink! ﻿Talk to me. Has it been long since you've had it? ﻿- Pang, where's Manit? - He went out to meet friends. ﻿- Do you know who? - No idea. ﻿Manit! ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Don't you give a shit about your wife and kid? ﻿Get up and come with me. I need to talk to you about something. ﻿Now! ﻿Right now, Mink's symptoms are like yours and Nim's back then, right? ﻿That's right. ﻿You must have Nim do the Acceptance Ceremony for Mink. ﻿You know I don't want my child to be a shaman. ﻿But if Ba Yan really wants Mink, what can you do? - ﻿I don't know what I have to do. - Think it over. ﻿What the hell is it with you? ﻿Calm down, sweetie. ﻿- Stop being nosy, hag! Hey! Why are you doing that? - ﻿What are you doing?! - Stop the car! ﻿- Get off! - No! ﻿- Stop! - Isaid I'm not getting off! ﻿- Have you lost it? - Damn all of you! ﻿You! ﻿- Get lost! - Come on, let's go. ﻿Damn you! ﻿Damn all of you. ﻿Shit. ﻿Dammit. ﻿Why the hell did they chase me off? Assholes. ﻿Huh?! ﻿I hope you all die. ﻿I hope all of you die. ﻿Is this all you got? ﻿Yes. ﻿Has Mink ever acted strange, like she's someone else? ﻿Well, she sometimes acts like a kid. ﻿Anything else, aside from acting like a kid? ﻿From our footage, there isn't anything else. ﻿- Have you seen my beaded bracelet? - Oh. ﻿It might have fallen off here, when I came to get things for Noi. ﻿- What bracelet? - My brown bracelet. ﻿- The one you always wear, right? - Yeah. ﻿Where did you go that day? ﻿I came to get the meds here, and I went up to Noi's room to get the scarf. ﻿It might have fallen off there. Noi, go up and take a look for Nim. ﻿It isn't around here. ﻿I really need to use it. Could you please take a look for me? ﻿Look thoroughly. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink, are you okay? ﻿Recently, have you heard someone calling you? ﻿And did you happen to answer them? ﻿Huh? ﻿- There has been, right? - Nim! What are you talking to her? ﻿They're not talking about anything. Just small talk between aunt and niece. ﻿What did you say to her? ﻿Nothing. ﻿- You told her to come, didn't you? - What are you talking about? ﻿She came looking for her bracelet It fell off the day she came to get your stuff. ﻿Mink. ﻿Fine, I'm leaving now. ﻿Mink, what is it? ﻿What did auntie say? ﻿What did she talk to you about? ﻿What is it? ﻿Mom. ﻿Tell me. ﻿Mom, I don't want to be a shaman. ﻿I won't let you be one. I won't let it happen. ﻿- Don't be afraid. - You have to help me. ﻿- Don't be afraid. - Mom, you have to help me. ﻿Why do you think Nim came to see Mink? ﻿She wants Mink to replace her as a shaman. ﻿She doesn't have any children. ﻿But no matter what, I won't let my child be a shaman. ﻿Ms. Kanda Yasantia. Receive your medicine at counter 2. ﻿I'll get it for you. Wait here. ﻿I've got headaches. It feels like my head's gonna explode. ﻿Stomachaches. Backaches. ﻿And that part also hurts. ﻿When it hurts.. ﻿it feels like it's going to rip apart. ﻿The doctor said he doesn't know what's wrong either. ﻿He doesn't know the cause. ﻿Have you dreamed of anything strange lately? ﻿I have the same dream repeatedly almost every night. ﻿In my dreams, I see a huge man. ﻿He's wearing a red loin cloth and a red vest with some kind of talisman all over it. ﻿In my dreams... ﻿he's holding a long sword. ﻿He stomps his foot ﻿and licks the blood from the sword. ﻿And.. ﻿there's a decapitated head and blood all over the floor. ﻿It's like the head is trying to tell me something. ﻿And what is the head saying? ﻿I try to listen to what it's saying. But... ﻿there isn't any sound that comes out. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿Mink, can you get up? ﻿Can you get up? ﻿Come on. ﻿Get out! ﻿I think we should go to the hospital. Let's go. ﻿Leave me alone. Get out! ﻿May I have a word with you? ﻿You can't film anymore. ﻿What the fuck are you saying?! ﻿How can you fire me? Asshole! ﻿Screw you! ﻿Mink. ﻿- Did you take your meds this morning? - Mink! ﻿- Will you be okay? - Mink, come change. ﻿I'll be outside. ﻿Done. Wait for us to do your hair. ﻿Mink? ﻿Mink? ﻿Hey! ﻿GOD REMAINS WITH US ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Whoa, she's so gorgeous. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Why doesn't she look at us? ﻿Mink! ﻿BORDER CROSSING POINT ﻿Where are you going now? ﻿To work. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Get out! ﻿Security! ﻿Get her out of here. ﻿The thing is... ﻿stuff in our office went missing. ﻿So I took a look at the CCTV ﻿Sumeth Recruitment Center Director ﻿and found this. ﻿As you can see.. ﻿Look. ﻿Disgusting. ﻿This woman is shameless. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Are you taking a shower? ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink! ﻿Noi? ﻿Manit! ﻿What is it, Noi? ﻿Oh, God! ﻿Shit! ﻿Go get some towels. Noi, call the doctor. ﻿Hurry, call an ambulance. Get me some towels. ﻿Shit! ﻿Noi! ﻿Be careful. ﻿It's the hospital, right? Send an ambulance right away. ﻿What happened? ﻿Why? ﻿Nim. ﻿Nim. ﻿I now surrender. ﻿I'll let Mink do the Acceptance Ceremony. ﻿Please hold the Acceptance Ceremony for Mink. ﻿I don't want to see my child like this. ﻿Mink can't do the Acceptance Ceremony. ﻿Why not? ﻿Because what's taken hold of Mink isn't Ba Yan. ﻿How come it's not? ﻿Mink's symptoms are like what you and I had. ﻿If Mink agrees to become a shaman, her symptoms will disappear too, right? ﻿I can't let Mink do the ceremony. ﻿You have to do it for Mink. ﻿Manit, come with me. ﻿Nim. ﻿I'm gonna go with Nim then. ﻿Nim, you have to do it for her. ﻿She's your niece. Don't you pity her? ﻿Open the door. ﻿Open what door? ﻿- This door. - What are you going to do? ﻿Hurry, will you? ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Tell me first, what are you gonna do? ﻿Tell me the truth. How did Mac really die? ﻿Everyone knows that his motorcycle flipped over. ﻿Tell me the truth. ﻿I know... ﻿Mink and Mac had something going on. ﻿Do you know ﻿what the soul of someone who commits suicide becomes? ﻿Do you? ﻿Tell me where Mac killed himself? ﻿The team agrees with Nim's judgment. ﻿They believe Mink is possessed by 'something else' ﻿Sit down slowly. ﻿Now that Nim won't do the Acceptance Ceremony for Mink, do you know what you're going to do next? ﻿If she won't help me, ﻿I'll find my own way. ﻿Even if.. ﻿it may go against my religion. ﻿I must do it. ﻿(Chanting) ﻿Mac! ﻿Tell me. ﻿All of this is your doing, right? ﻿I know that you love her, but you can't take her. ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿Are you really going to do this, Noi? ﻿Yeah, just drive. ﻿Get the stuff and come upstairs. ﻿All right. ﻿Stop right now! ﻿Stop! I said stop! ﻿Stop! ﻿Nim. ﻿- Stop it! - Why are you doing this?! ﻿How could you do a random ceremony like this?! ﻿What if she receives some evil spirit? ﻿What do you expect me to do? She is about to die. ﻿- You won't help me. - You don't understand. ﻿Why wouldn't I help you? ﻿-I have my own way. - When are you gonna help me? ﻿- Why did you do the ceremony with this man? - You want me to watch my child die? ﻿Do you know who he is? ﻿Mink. ﻿When are you going to help? Are you going to let her die? ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink! Stop it, Mink! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink, stop! ﻿Stop! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Nim. ﻿What about Mink? ﻿Mink. ﻿- Where's Mink, Nim? - Lie down. Lie down, first. ﻿What about Mink? ﻿Did you find Mink? Did you find her? ﻿Oh, Mink. ﻿Why is she like this, Nim? ﻿You have to help Mink. ﻿You have to help her, Nim. ﻿The only way to find her is to hold a ceremony. ﻿But first things first, Noi must open her heart ﻿to accept Ba Yan, ﻿and beg for Her forgiveness, ﻿even if she once shunned Ba Yan away, ﻿which is a serious matter. ﻿But I believe She will have mercy on Noi. ﻿Lift it above your head. ﻿If Noi really opens her heart to Her, ﻿Ba Yan will definitely forgive her. ﻿Give the offerings to Her. ﻿What's that smell? ﻿Go through it all. ﻿We have to gather all the foul things Mink's collected from various places ﻿and do a ceremony. ﻿What is this? Take a look. ﻿Because in these things, there are traces of the spirits Mink came in contact with. ﻿Nim. Look here. ﻿She even kept this under the bed. ﻿She has baby shoes, too. ﻿Nim. ﻿Huh? ﻿Take everything out of here. ﻿Take it all away. ﻿And we must do the ceremony where Mac killed himself. ﻿I'll have to pray to Mac not to harm Mink. ﻿I have to let Mac know, ﻿even if he loved Mink, or was mad and seeking revenge on this family, ﻿I won't let him do anything to her. ﻿Actually, I don't even know how much longer I have to pray. ﻿No matter how long it takes, I'll just keep doing it. ﻿Until I know where Mac took Mink. ﻿A taxi saw the announcement. ﻿So he gave the clip from his dashcam to the police. ﻿The driver said that he picked Mink up around 3 a.m. ﻿When she got in, ﻿he asked her questions, but she didn't answer. ﻿After that, you can see what happened in the clip. ﻿Hey. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Hey! ﻿Hey! ﻿What the hell? ﻿Fine, I'm gonna leave now. ﻿Shit! ﻿Dammit. ﻿Maybe this clip is edited? ﻿I had someone take a look at the scene. ﻿There hasn't been any other leads on Mink. ﻿If there is any more news, I'll let you know. ﻿I'm worried for my daughter. ﻿I don't know where she is now, alive or dead. ﻿All I can do is pray... ﻿to the Lord ﻿and any other gods out there. ﻿Please bring my daughter back to me. ﻿I already went everywhere. ﻿Everyone's house, all her friends' houses, all her ex's. ﻿I went everywhere, but no one's seen her. ﻿I've prayed and done everything I could. ﻿If it had worked, she'd be back by now. ﻿HEAVENLY MEAT ﻿SEAMSTRESS TEMPORARILY CLOSED ﻿Ever since Mink disappeared, everyone in the family is miserable, ﻿especially Noi. ﻿She can't eat or sleep at all. ﻿A month has already passed. We haven't received any news. ﻿Are you wasting taxpayers' money?! ﻿- It's not like that. - Police are all the same! ﻿- It's not like that. - No matter which station. ﻿It's been a month already. All I see is you sitting around. ﻿You guys just sit around. ﻿-I don't see you doing anything. - They're working, sir. ﻿I just see you with your eyes open, that's all. Is this what you call working? ﻿There hasn't been any more news. ﻿Nothing. ﻿No news, no leads from anywhere at all. ﻿I've been completely tricked so far. ﻿It's done by the ones that have nothing to do with Mac. ﻿Then, who are they? ﻿YASANTIA THREAD FACTORY ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink. ﻿Mink, wake up. ﻿Right now, the patient is safe, ﻿but she might be malnourished. ﻿She has bruises and scratches, but they're not so bad. ﻿Will my daughter go back to normal again? ﻿When the patient regains consciousness, we'll reevaluate her symptoms. ﻿Right now, things are becoming clearer. ﻿It's a good thing that it didn't kill Mink. ﻿I'm going to go up the mountain again. ﻿I have to pray and beg Ba Yan once more. ﻿Who did this to you, Ba Yan? ﻿Where did you go? What did you do? Tell me. ﻿Try to take at least one bite. ﻿It didn't even go in her mouth. ﻿Mink is now completely possessed. ﻿Who are you? ﻿I asked, who are you? ﻿I'm Ba Yan. ﻿I asked, who are you?! ﻿Why don't you guess who I am? ﻿Try guessing. ﻿Hey! What's with you?! ﻿Mink! ﻿Have you lost it?! ﻿You're crazy! ﻿Why is she like this? ﻿Mink! ﻿Don't you like young girls' pussies? Don't you like it?! ﻿Why are you doing this?! ﻿Mink! ﻿Mink, why are you doing this? ﻿- Get her off. - Let go of me! ﻿- Get her off. - Let me go! ﻿Mink. ﻿- Hold her down. - Let go! ﻿Mink. ﻿- Why are you like this? - Let go! ﻿Hold her down. Quick. ﻿Put her index finger in the glass! ﻿Mink. ﻿You know... ﻿the reason you're like this ﻿is because of your beloved sister. ﻿She planned to get you to wear her clothes every day. ﻿She put talismans in your shoes. ﻿She did everything ﻿to get you to be the shaman instead of her. ﻿Did you know? ﻿Go find something to tie her up with. Hurry! ﻿Tie her up tightly. ﻿Hurry up. ﻿Hurry! When you're done, get out. ﻿Get out first. ﻿Stop filming already. ﻿Get out! Out! ﻿Everyone, get out. ﻿I need to find someone to help me. ﻿Nim. ﻿About what Mink just said... ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿It's fine. I'm going to help her anyway. ﻿ ﻿Santi. ﻿Are you still involved with these clowns? ﻿I still have to make a living, you know. ﻿Mink. ﻿Hey, wait. ﻿You guys.. ﻿took her to do some random Acceptance Ceremony, right? ﻿Mink's condition right now... ﻿is like a car that has the key left in it. ﻿Anyone can drive it anywhere. ﻿And who is this spirit? ﻿It's not just one. ﻿I don't know who they are. ﻿If you want me to count how many, it's also impossible. ﻿All I know is that... ﻿they're all in it together because they're vindictive. ﻿And it's this vengeance... ﻿that attracted all the wandering ghosts as well as the lost spirits of beasts... ﻿such as snakes, dogs, centipedes, spiders... ﻿and those of plants and grass. ﻿All of them have gathered together and become a very powerful, evil demon. ﻿Right here. ﻿This is where I found Mink. ﻿We'll conduct the ceremony right here, ﻿where all the evil spirits originated from. ﻿If we can get rid of them all, their slivers in Mink will also disappear. ﻿And why does it have to be Mink? ﻿Do you know about the ancestors of your husband's family? ﻿Wiroj's ancestors beheaded thousands of people. ﻿The last wishes of those dying people were to curse the family, ﻿and their children and offspring never stopped making bad karma. ﻿And Wiroj... ﻿married you. ﻿The one who rejected Ba Yan. ﻿From then on... ﻿everything was destined to be that ﻿the one who has to pay redemption is Mink. ﻿Do you think it's reasonable? ﻿About what Santi said, that everything was destined. ﻿You don't have to worry. We'll get the auspicious date soon. ﻿Destined by who? ﻿God? ﻿Buddha? ﻿Other deities? ﻿If it's the ancestors that created bad karma, ﻿why does Mink have to pay for it? Why not me? ﻿Go sit over there first. ﻿You don't have to think too much. ﻿Once the ceremony is done, Mink will get better. ﻿Ba Yan will help us. ﻿Back then, when I was sick, ﻿everyone said Ba Yan was going to possess me. ﻿But I didn't feel anything. ﻿was just sick. ﻿Let me ask you something. ﻿Have you ever seen Ba Yan? ﻿Is there really a Ba Yan? ﻿Of course, there is. ﻿Have you ever seen Her? ﻿No. ﻿Then how do you know? ﻿I can feel it. ﻿I can feel Her. ﻿You have to believe in Ba Yan, ﻿and She will help us. ﻿(Chanting) ﻿To perform this ceremony, ﻿the more evil and dangerous the spirits are, the more I have to be prepared. ﻿I have to make lots of talismans and consecrate them all, ﻿including a sacred wand. ﻿I consecrate them over and over with all the power I have. ﻿And I also have to prepare holy water, candles, and incense. ﻿It's really an extravagant affair. ﻿Most importantly, I have to do the ceremony with Nim. ﻿Nim and I have to be united as one. It's really tough, but it's challenging. ﻿Although, I've been doing this for a long time. Let's see how tough they are. ﻿She won't eat anything. ﻿When I talk with her, she's not receptive. ﻿I'm really stressed out. ﻿Nim hasn't come either. She's been busy with the ceremony preparations. ﻿One other thing... ﻿every morning when I come down, the house is a total mess. ﻿It must be Mink. She does it every night. ﻿I don't know what she does. ﻿The team decided to install cameras inside the house ﻿to observe Mink's behavior at night. ﻿6 days before the ceremony ﻿Lucky. ﻿Lucky. ﻿Lucky. ﻿What's wrong, Lucky? ﻿5 days before the ceremony ﻿4 days before the ceremony ﻿3 days before the ceremony ﻿If you set up cameras everywhere like this, then no more filming. ﻿- Manit... - Pack your stuff and go! I won't allow it! ﻿I'm asking you, please watch till the very end. ﻿- Please. - What? ﻿Why is she like this? ﻿If she's become crazy like this, how can we keep living together? ﻿You can go live wherever you want. ﻿I'm staying here with my child. ﻿I admit that... ﻿it looks scary. ﻿But she's still my child. ﻿It won't be long till she gets better. ﻿Nim will help her. ﻿Nim is an expert. She's helped lots of people. ﻿She can definitely help Mink. ﻿Don't you think? ﻿After seeing Mink's behavior, ﻿the family members allowed the team to install more cameras. ﻿My stomach hurts. ﻿2 days before the ceremony ﻿Done. ﻿She can't get out anymore. ﻿She can only dream of getting out. ﻿That's it.

Quick! Nim! ﻿Nim died while asleep. ﻿Isan people call it, 'Lai Tai'. ﻿Doctors could not conclude the cause of death. ﻿Nim died because of me. ﻿Mink is like this because of me. ﻿I have no one left in my life. ﻿From now on, ﻿I'm going to do everything to protect my daughter from harm. ﻿I'm even willing to die. ﻿Why did Nim die? The spirits did it, right? ﻿There's no way we can know. ﻿What's that supposed to mean? ﻿Why are you saying such things? ﻿Master, what are we supposed to do now? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿Tomorrow, we will conduct the ceremony as planned. ﻿Day of ceremony ﻿- Put it here? - Yeah, put it over there. ﻿Master Santi, please tell us about today's ceremony. ﻿The ceremony will take place on the 5th floor. ﻿The first thing I have to do is ﻿summon the evil spirits to gather ﻿into Mink's body. ﻿Then ﻿I'll expel the spirits ﻿into the cursed pot. ﻿And I'll take the pot to the ground floor, bury it, and perform a spellbinding ritual. ﻿Based on what happened to Nim, ﻿will it be too risky to let Mink still be a part of the ceremony? ﻿Well, yeah. ﻿But... ﻿have you noticed the back of Manit's car? ﻿It has a sticker that says.. "This car is red." ﻿THIS CAR IS RED ﻿What does that have to do with the ceremony? ﻿Don't let anyone ﻿leave the area of the ceremony at all, ﻿until the ceremony is over. ﻿(Chanting) ﻿Come and eat! ﻿Come on! Come and get it! ﻿Come! ﻿Why did she scream? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Noi! ﻿Noi! ﻿Noi! ﻿- Noi. - How is she? ﻿She's just blacked out. - Take her to rest up. ﻿Noi! ﻿Noi! ﻿Noi! ﻿How are you, Noi? ﻿Can you hear me? ﻿Is there anyone out there?
