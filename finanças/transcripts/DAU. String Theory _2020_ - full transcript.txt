I understand everything... Honest *F is a closed 2-form - Yes - Which... can be locally written out as a differential of some other connection Therefore there's a mapping, not a local one ...acting from A, which solves the Maxwell motion equation... ...into A tilde, which also solves the Maxwell motion equation That's because *F tilde, which is F... ...also solves this equation... - ...of course - Wait, is this all happening on a manifold? Yes, it's happening on a 4D manifold We could carry on tomorrow OK And yet you somehow managed to dodge the question I mean, you wrote out a very elegant general formula... - ...for the Yang-Mills algebra - Yes And yet you considered a strictly special case, which... That's because we know almost nothing about the general case So why do you think the formula is true in the general case anyway? - Perhaps it's because... - No, the formula is not true In actual fact, if... It's more likely to be false A super Yang-Mills algebra would be more likely to be true That is, an algebra that, apart from these even generators, also has... ...odd generators, which... In actual fact... I mean, Turns out that in the case of super Yang-Mills... ...it's actually - let's say, if it's ten-dimensional... ...then it proves to be equivalent to an algebra of this type instead This cod liver smells terrible, doesn't it? plus we're still waiting for the bread - Who's bringing the bread? - Dasha and Semenych - Have they been gone long? - Yes - So we shouldn't be waiting? - Sorry? - We shouldn't be waiting? - No, we should They seem to be serious people I mean, not in everything, but in general, serious - It's just... - So sometimes a serious person shouldn't be serious? - Or they'll go mad? - Otherwise it's not appreciated Right, we need a spoon You know, what we need is onions Dasha, we've been waiting for you. Where's the bread? It's coming We haven't brought it ourselves - Make it even finer - Are you grinding the flour? Even finer? Let me do it. I can turn it into mush Here, I'll do it with a fork I just did that, but... Losev, what's going on out there? Nekrasov chopped the eggs We went to the bio lab - And the rats were... - You don't like how I handle eggs? What are you insinuating? The rats aren't scared of the current We can just mush it up - We can do that now - I don't eat that Fine, I'll take it out - I don't like it - Me neither Pickles would do nicely here Why don't you eat olives? - Alright, alright - I just don't Why don't I... - Let's do it in a clean one - This was a surprise Olives with cod's liver, not bad Let me just get a spoon - What are you doing? - We have a new dish here - I'm sorry to... - Hand-broken olives, made by - An academician - An academician, yes Well, that's not bad - I'll leave a spoonful - It does smell a bit... - Fishy - Wet - Wet? - That's the cod liver No, I mean the olives I see - I'll put them here - It'll be easier - Ira dear, sit down. Sit down, guys - Really? I'm sitting here - Blinov is fine over there - I'll take another chair You can sit with Blinov - When it dries up outside... - I'm going mad - Then I'll sit here - Then I'll find a different chair - So... There, take that - Thanks very much - Right - When what dries up? - The soil, Losev - The soil, I see - Please, don't - It's a bog out there, so slippery Yes. I am worried about it too - Sit down, sit with me - I am - Absolutely right. The only reason... - Dasha, here - Please don't be angry with Losev - We'll have bread in a minute - I'm not angry with him - Losev, pass me your plate - That's the bread calling - Nekrasov - "Hello, this is bread" - You want another helping? - Of course - Can I serve myself maybe? But of course My dear comrades... Am I repeating myself? No, no, say it again Ira, you arrived after my birthday, didn't you? That's right - I love you so much - And we love you, too Blinov. Come back. It's an important one Where's our vase gone? Sorry, carry on - The vase left... - I repeat, I love you all so much We love you too - Let's not look for meaning - To hell with it It'll come to us if it's there Everything has its meaning But we won't look for any specific meaning Well put But it's everywhere We won't look for any specific meaning - Does it make sense? - Yes. Well said I'm glad to hear it Taoists maintain that in the beginning there was chaos And God drilled eight holes in that chaos I've heard so many interesting numbers today There are several hypotheses about that - Dima mentioned nine - I was just saying... I thought there were seven - Seven, you're right - But actually it makes no difference - Anyway... - which hypotheses - Anyway... - are there It doesn't matter how many holes there were The fact is that the world appeared A world that can be described and understood Can we though? I don't know about that Maybe we don't need to - Maybe we don't need to - Right - Good point - You have to understand yourself first Ira dear, how can one understand oneself? One has to try Before talking about the world, first talk about yourself Actually there's no difference between oneself and the world - Yes, I agree - Right We... I agree "Don't you freeze me" "Don't you freeze me" "Don't you freeze my horse" Why are you out here, barefoot? What's the matter? I just went for a walk actually. Like the right bastard What were you thinking? You'll catch a cold - Quick, hurry - I don't want to hurry I just don't Stop. What are you doing? - Wait a minute - Here is our lovely security We'll be given either a key or a punch They'll give us something, that's for sure - I'm a bit cold - Of course you are, no coat on Well, what else could I... I'll keep it on, is that alright? Sure, that's fine My slippers, I need to take my slippers off - No, stop - They're covered in dirt What's this? Glass? Blinov... Katya here is completely frozen Drink. I need something to drink What are you on about? I was given a car but not the keys I dreamt of the trumpets of Jericho There was some already - Try and open this with a spoon - We have everything here See? I opened it with a spoon. Did you see that? Here, cognac And I'll have vodka if we have any - I'll drink cognac too - So, to what? To - To the victory of Soviet science - Over a Soviet man Actually... - I can't drink any more - You don't have to But Katya dear, you just need to get warm - I'll be fine without - You need socks - Just drink and you'll get warm - No, not necessarily Are there any matches? - Matches... - No, you drink, I'll find them - No. Please sit down - Matches are important Dasha has the cigarette holder - I need some matches too - Fine Fuck, what's all this... Come on, let's go Blinov, Katya - Why aren't you drinking? - I can't Do you think I can? We can. Women are the weaker sex Don't you start - No, they're the strongest, of course - It was said with love It's not meant in a diminutive or derogatory way or anything But just with regards to the consumption of liquor So... - We're not some... - Please, don't take it off It's fucking cold as it is and you're all so thin so adorably vulnerable I mean, she's just the best, isn't she So, comrades Cheers Here's to things getting better and more wonderful No, it can't get more wonderful - There's three of us here, you know - Sorry, Blinov - No, I understand - We're mentally still in that car - I get it - We were denied the keys We wanted to go for a ride, or at least warm up - Right? - Yes - So let's get warm - Yes Here's to everything being always You can't drink anymore, well, don't - Right Blinov, let's drink. Sit - Let's drink - Did we really eat all the liver? - We did - We ate everything - The liver is gone that is why We are done Take it, take it Olives over there. Katya. Please, give me some of that stuff Well then? - What? - Another night's gone - Already? No, not yet - Yes, it has, look - It's getting light. I hate dawn - The dawn is here - It's getting brighter - And we never slept No, no - not a wink Although frankly, at first I mistook the car hooting for the trumpets of Jericho Sorry, my dear fellow. You see, it's just... - No, it doesn't matter - You get in the car, but... You have nothing to start the engine with. It hurts On the other hand taking, as it were, a dialectical approach to the issue of the trumpets of Jericho Yes - I got, let's say - Yes? - an image into my head - Yes of a multidimensional surface, on which You're not drinking a fucking thing. Just look at me You're talking too much bullshit. That's why I... - Or taking too much - Yes That's why I'm not keeping up - Sorry for spil... - Not to worry - It's not engine oil - No, it'll dry out That's why I got, let's say, an image in my head - of a multidimensional space - Go on across which a sound expands the sound of the Big Bang - You know... - And before reaching the point at which you can perceive it that sound takes the form of the frequency at which I am able to perceive it as the trumpets of Jericho - If I were an acoustician... - Please, I can't bear it - you just look so cold - What the hell does it matter? No, you are beautiful and wonderful. You are the best You don't let me go Give me your feet. Both, please Both your feet present a great interest to me No need to touch Blinov I told you I was really jealous Madly, madly jealous - You can't be jealous - I can - Over three, or four... - I can - You can? - Yes - Well, that's a fuck-up, comrade - I'm just a completely fucking... - Selfish person - A fucking jealous guy - Who? - A jealous guy - That's the same thing - No - There - No. It's completely different Because if I love someone - Someone? Lots at the same time? - then I worry about them all - No, that's not true - Yes, it is It's just a complete fucking lie There now - Mind the fucking table - I turned the table round How? With my foot No, see, I put it here, I cushioned it Crusher Blinov, you just went and filled them up right away Yes - Why wait? - You're right - Why the hell - Just a moment, Katya dear, alright? Does it really hurt? From that leg being bent down there? - I don't give a fuck about it - Good - It's just physical pain - Let's drink to Blinov because he's actually helping somehow, really - He's helping you - Not you? Then let's not drink to him No, I'll drink to Blinov - because he's helping me too - No, no, Katya - But now he's helping you - No, you didn't understand me Now everything is happening through you There's a lot of responsibility in that Frankly, things are completely fucked, right? Yes. I'm going to bed - We all are - Well, here's to being fucked over Blinov, you're something else You're fucking awesome, you really are - Katya, please don't go - I'm going to sleep - You think we have it easy? - Nobody has it easy Why did you throw down your bag? What's all this? And you threw my coat, and... - Should I hang it up? - No, you're cold Don't you worry, I've got a blanket Just a moment, I'll be back in a minute Fuck - Alright, let's have a snack - Let's Nothing sweet though But we have exactly three olives over there Right - Let's form a threesome then - Yes What's going on with your children? - They're all big, you know - Yes. You see - They're growing - Yes Well, they'll grow up eventually - What can we do - You see... The day will come when we'll be buried - No... - We'll be washed Ptomaine will be washed off our corpses, dammit And the grave wax will be used to fertilise potatoes - Who knows? - It makes me feel insecure Almost everyone here has grown-up kids or they never fucking had them And I fucking left them - Nekrasov... - halfway Nekrasov, you gave them life Blinov, one is four, the other is ten Four might mean something - But ten... - She's much more mature than the ten-year-old He's just so sensitive So she... She doesn't even... Of course... She knows how to deal with me, how to put me in my place much better than the boy does simply because, well... Right. You understand Yes Teach me, teach me how... Right That's all very well but... Fine No, Blinov... You're simplifying things - Yes - Fuck - Life is simple - No it's not, it's all bullshit The lack of simplicity is in your and my - personal feelings - Yes But those feelings are... It's individualism - No wait... - You see? It's yours - Why is my or your individualism - Yes less valuable than anyone else's? Why? It's not value, but attitude that matters Right, but whose attitude to what? - Yours to yourself - Right - I'm a shit - And my attitude to myself - I'm a shit too - No, you're not, Blinov - We're shits - I realised ages ago, you're not... - We're shits - No. You're amazing - Shits floating around in space - No Well, that's true in general, of course - Yes - Yes We'll kick the bucket and turn into something new - and again... - Into smoke, steam, gas Yes No, that's not the point Until we kick the bucket - Yes - We have a chance to pass on some knowledge, skills, understanding But our feelings will die with us So here's to them - Nekrasov - Alright then - It's not helping - To all the things - In the last 24 hours... - that ptomaine cannot destroy Listen, I just... You know, it's not awareness that matters Why not? That matters too - Doesn't it? - It's just a part of it - That's true, of course, but... - What about feelings? - Feelings? Yes - Were those not feelings? - Well... - Are you telling me that all that... You know, it's so much more complicated If everything was simply about feelings... Not simplicity, but feelings - There was feeling of course - There you go But if there wasn't some feeling pointed in that direction - everything would be much simpler - Then you wouldn't be human - Why? Why? - You wouldn't be as complex or as interesting So why does she, the one over there understand fuck all about it? - Well? - She understands You think so? - But maybe... - But what? - It doesn't match - So you see I'm very well acquainted with that - Very well acquainted - Unrequited feelings It's not that it's unrequited... It's just the levels don't match Yes. That's what it is And different levels of feelings is a very strange phenomenon It can't be analysed or doubted or understood And you shouldn't try to understand it - You just shouldn't even attempt it - Why not? - You should just feel and exist - But people are, well... They do understand. They take comfort from it It's granted to us every other day - And at Easter - But night... But nights are ours - Yes - To do disgraceful things But night is full of feelings - But why should it be Katya's fault? - It shouldn't Well, it appears she's got my whole supply - of love and happiness - And she's enjoying herself She's not though, she's suffering I didn't give myself to her completely - There's happiness in suffering - I think that's a male trait People get their kicks from lack of availability I think that's a male trait too - It's a female one too - I think women can't... It's not that they can't, but they avoi... - You think they don't need it? - No, they definitely don't Because they have to create - a home, a family - But only - Yes? - if the woman is simple Simple to the point of losing interest But if there's something in her even just a little - this very thing - Right... - Lights up - guides them - Carries them along - Well, maybe you're right and allows them to fly Look, there's still a little left our dear, precious vodka - Just a little bit - We'll divide it equally Absolutely. Fuck Without a second thought... Wait a second - I'm gonna light up - I think I'll keep you company - In lighting up? - Yes Because... Because... Because This is fucked up Yes. You think so? Right. Here, I've found it Is this called a roll-up? - Or just a cigarette? - Cigarette Fine. I'll try a cigarette Katya Katya That's a good echo, you know. A good echo - Up the lamp post? - Katya Where are you? Could she be up there? I think she's over there The bins... Nekrasov I don't know... Why is everything annoying? Actually, there's so much...? For him to start to explain? Me too - What the fuck is going on? - Yeah, something's going on... It's just... I just prefer the truth, it's not... - What was it for? - You see, the main thing... So the truth exists now, right? Yeah So everything you're doing is truthful - right now? It's... Wait a second, and I'll tell you Men often say, you know... ...I love you - But it's the same with me - Ah, yes It's not only men - Well... - But when they say this phrase... ...about... ...love, but they mean something different... - Well, yes, that's clear - It's a different truth, yeah It's the truth, but it's like it completely shuts them off, right? - Of course - No, of course, but, no... I don't want you to feel guilty... ...or try to... I'm not some kind of victim, am I? - I'm completely... - No, no, you're just... ...like a queen, a princess... Basically, you choose who you want, but it's... ...it's just strange... You see... ...two months ago, everything was completely different You're fickle in love. It's so obvious But... It's not... Don't see it all as... Don't see it as anything at all from my side The matches are in my pocket The last batch in the house I got it This is all that's left Once an arsehole, always an arsehole I am not Sofronov - Close enough though - The fucked up audience - I'll sit here - No, don't, it's wet there - Can I... Why don't I... - Why don't I just go somewhere else No, really Ira, may I have that for a second? Thanks very much Dasha, you just can't... - Yes, I get it - How can a skirt smell of cognac? It can. Better it smells of cognac than of that arsehole Go, everything's fine - Katya dear... - Yes? I don't really want to hear it I was going to say something else Go on then True. Have you decided what you'll be speaking about? - Yes - Tell me, please - I'll be speaking about Yorick... - You're wonderful - Who fucking cares about him? - You're wonderful in every way Hang on. There was Yorick And Yorick had a... - Yorick was actually a... - Yes - So this fact... - What? Everything we talked about As all that shit was happening Fuck, I asked you directly, right at the start - Right - Be specific, enough bullshit - Yes, yes, right - I don't need that - Right. And what did I say? - Fine - Dasha, you have a husband - You acted bullshit - And I sense this bullshit - But... - Fuck, that's it - Calm down - It's awf... - So you sense the bullshit Well, I got to the point where... Well, now it's true So all that happened... I even asked... But I can't understand this ambiguous silence The thing is, I don't even want to understand I mean, I don't want it to - wound me, or hurt or kill me - No - I've no idea... - Of course not It shouldn't hurt you or wound you or anything - You... - It's your life - Great. Absolutely - No, don't tell me... Just don't do that, really Now it just looks completely stupid - and dishonest - But it is all honest I never said anything dishonest Not once - Yes. So actually... - Yes Actually the whole story is set in France And it's about addition, not multiplication - Yeah - And instead of the inspector... And he asks what's twenty times four Not all men are the same - Thank God - Some can... That's great to know - Four, twenty - Yeah And he immediately realises that it's noncommutative multiplication. So... - So that's the great Arnold - Yes I usually say that addition involves simplification I can't, my tummy really hurts - Comrades - Yes - With the right hand - Cheers I suggest drinking to Katya - I suggest drinking to Katya - With great pleasure Shit, I've fucking ruined everything Sit down, Blinov. Listen... I always ruin everything Nekrasov, you can't ruin everything - I ruin everything I touch - Not true Wait, I don't get it Are you looking at homology generators? No, the generators in the ring of functions Algebraic functions Yes, but do you need all loops for that? - All the loops, yes - All of them? - So just the P1 generators? - Yes, that's enough Well then, you just... You can plot a certain figure on the group with L2C Placing the dots in some kind of order G1 - Gn you just get an n-gon But it is cut along the diagonals... But the choice of this graph corresponds to splitting this n-gon into triangles Fuck, again Shall we slice some bread? It is sliced Dasha, may I talk to Katya? Why are you asking me? - No, I just... - I don't want to talk I don't want to talk to you Not to you Not to you Well, it's none of my business. Do whatever you want It's none of my business at all But that definitely isn't the way to do it Why not? Because you see, you stabbed her with a knife and twisted it on top of that And then you want something from her to boot It's your wife you need to apologise to. Although that's also... I don't know. I'm not married, you see Let's be reasonable: what did you want to tell her? - "I don't love you, dear"? - Yes Why are you saying this now? Do you want her to have a berakdown? - I didn't tell her I loved her - It doesn't matter People don't listen to what they say to each other - If we listen to what we say, then - God We tell lies all the time. Everybody knows it I didn't want to lie It's the characteristic of man psychology... ...the main is in words. Words are filtered. You can't divide things... into words and everything else. In words do everything nicely or anyhow. It's not so in fact. good that you did not say that you love her but its not important Because when you love someone... ...to say "I love you" is the same as nice stroke on somebody's cheek and no more. You can do it just to please somebody. The value of these words is trifling. For me it means taking some obligations onto myself People are not machines It's not a legal contract that you sign When you become close to someone you automatically take on obligations Or you don't. Or you don't become close. It's impossible to formalise Nikita, can I have a word? Nikita, tell me, please. We're alone now Is there anything I can do for you? Nikita, I want you to know that... You're going through a hard time now... - ...but you know, I'm always here for you - Yes, I know - So there we are - Thank you Bear that in mind, will you? I'm not going to ask any questions or anything I'm here for you, ready to help. Deal? Thank you This is double Omega 1 or a differentiation space of A into itself and all the mappings of A into itself are such we have the Leibniz limit So, D(ab) is equal to aD(b) plus bD(a) So There are all sorts of formulas here Standard things which are taught in first year - I get it - It all works Now we see new phenomena, which didn't exist before We see phenomena for the form and for the inert fields For form, the phenomena are such that ordinarily in characteristic zero which actually depends on P number The simple number P, obtained on polynomial and this operation behaves the same There is a sum, and it goes so... And here this thing pops up We could write the formula, but it's a difficult one Hence if there is a sum of a few therms we'll have another long tail Impossible stuff So one should try and think about it in an abstract way. It's difficult to be concrete Right. This was a general introduction Now I have a specific question which I don't understand how to explore Wait, what about the one-dimensional... It's non-additive either What you mean? - Fine - It is never additive - Alright - In the strict sense When it's only one variable... You're right Non-commutative vector fields I like the view you take on the string theory, in the sense that the colleagues I communicate with they say it is very unlikely but it is worth it because of the beauty So it is an artistic - infatuation - A creative one - Yes, creative - Do you expect results? that experiments can prove in your life time? That you don't have much left of 20 or 30 years, realistically speaking Say 30 - Fine, 40 - May be I do expect it to And if it doesn't happen you'd get upset? If I'm honest, in 40 years I won't care - And now you care still? - I do So by the time it's proven you won't care? So why the hell bother? Because it is not why I do it I do it because of the beauty that I see now - For me the beauty is... - So you're being a physicist? It may... It may be a flaw of mine I've never experienced the joy of the results proving the theory I personally haven't experienced it And for people who had that experience... And beauty makes you happy? - And that's enough? - Yes You do what you do for beauty? That's what you want it to be I do what I do... Well, no, wait a second, I believe it is so But we don't really know what the string theory is So saying either it is true or not is too early I have to say that unlike my attachments to women that you wanted to discuss my attachment to the string theory is the most lasting in my life But you used to study something else Cosmology? It was all within the theory - So it's the same... - Yes And do you ever feel that you're doing the same thing? Of course Not different things, that come one after another - but the same - It's an artistic gift Well - Wait, this is interesting - It's quite a sore spot - because... - That's why I'm asking I feel like I repeat the same movement that I do the same thing, mentally I mean and when I have the energy I try to steer away from it as well - So you do feel that? - I do, yes I see And do you have some idea of your goal? Of the mission you would like to accomplish? Science assumes that one has faith in what you do no matter how pointless it seems or the goal the authorities present you with seems to have little relation to what you're doing because you have some other motives You find pleasure in this activity, you see beauty in it but if you do everything in a right and honest way there will be a goal and it will be reached You said you are doing things because they're beautiful But isn't beauty forced upon us by the society? Science is communicative Nothing exists until you tell people about it What is beauty anyway? That's what I'd like to know too Things often appear beautiful but then... Do you know what I think? Beauty is the construction of the world we'd like to live in Imagine if this world was easy to explain That is, being able to decode everything without any trouble Like a dozen wise men got together and told us everything And then we just keep living But if you just keep living you lose your creativity You stop striving, you stop confronting all those things That's the question of freedom of choice and of whether or not you can predict the future once you've understood the laws of nature But even knowing them you can't predict anything because those laws are probable But what if they were predetermined, those laws? - Life would be boring then - Well, yes We're not designed to live in an ideal world - I mean, that's not the idea - That's absolutely right But the ideal world is most likely to be empty and uninteresting It's a serious problem, that you can imagine very many worlds but you can't understand why our world is the way it is - Do you have a girlfriend? - I have a wife And is she the one you dreamt of? The one whose image you subconsciously created? Several times I felt that I "recognised" a woman I thought she was the one, the ideal woman whose image I'd created subconsciously, just as you said I was just absolutely sure she was the one And going forward you either live and try to make this thing go on or you simply become disappointed Either she turns you down because you might not be ideal for her either I still maintain art can present us with what we expect and what we do not In other words I believe that the Black Square by Malevich as an example is a terrifically sacral picture When I saw it in Petrograd for the first time I felt as though I am standing in front of an icon There is a certain mysticism in this aesthetics without hard work without resources or talent you can create a work of art - Just intellectually? - Yes Whenever someone looks at the Square they are a bit shocked Who's thought of that? How can it be? Anyway, it is interesting It's an illusion How do people look at it? They see what they didn't see in Rembrandt's works What's shocking is that you see a very intimate scene that you can't talk about A mystery that can't be shared but he shows it to everyone It's harsh and abrupt but very sophisticated at the same time because there's nothing really just black and white paint Does science have its own Black Square? No, Black Square is an imitation They tried to organize art as science What if you organize science as art For example, to create an institute which will be like a theatre It's the ladies' turn to choose, Blinov - The ladies' turn - Yes, yes Nobody needs you - Asya's not asking you to dance - Come on, let's dance Palych is choosing all the tunes. Denis, quick That's not right, Asya Is this a waltz? I've forgotten how you do it I used to be able to Those were the hard times when vodka was rationed That's right We managed to trade in a load of ration tokens for vodka And had a party in my friend's flat So he failed to do his revision because I couldn't save him from himself That was not unexpected but Petya, who didn't take part in the drinking Anyway. What are you all drinking? We drink anything - Anything that burns - Riesling? Shmiesling? Anything that burns. Cheese doesn't so we're not having that Head of a lab is someone who... who either gets fucked or fucks others What the fuck do you think you're doing? Comrades, who's up for cider? Cider - Cider, that's a proper nighttime drink - You'll have some, right? Especially mixed with vodka - Thanks, but I don't drink - Just take it It's refreshing I want to explain... We have a theoretical department an experimental and theoretical department Blinov and I here When I came here after the war... We... there was a time when, between the two of us we only had three screwdrivers and two soldering irons, right? - For example, Tourette's - That's me - Don't, there's no need - But you'll freeze It's not that far What's this smell? Maybe I'll put the kettle on Doing a bit of housework? But of course. What's this? Dedicated to Anna Grigorievna We could read the book out loud It's The Brothers Karamazov, as you may have guessed It is pretty interesting "As I start the life story of my hero" "I find myself to be rather puzzled" "This is because, although I'm calling him my hero" "I know all too well that he's by no means a great person" "I know there'll be a stream of inevitable questions" "What makes him so remarkable?" Well? I'm in love with you, you know Yes, well Nothing new there You didn't have to take that long Yes It's a very juvenile feeling but it will pass quickly Sooner or later Honestly - Yes - There you go If on one side of the scales you've got your wife and two kids and on the other side you have something incomprehensible which affects a few people at the same time, then... You may have all sorts of feelings but... how can I explain It's great they're there, but no practical outcome will come of it Whatever happens, we should define our relationship - Do you want some tea? - Tea? Why not Something will explode otherwise, either a kettle or... You know, I haven't got or nearly haven't got, I don't know When you're young there's always the problem of being possessive If you've got some object or other that you have some kind of feelings for It's really torturous if you can't... If you can't have it You need to have it But I don't have this problem right now Or perhaps it just seems so at the moment I do have it Well, it's... I think so, anyway I reckon, sorry, but I reckon it's quite childish and egocentric a whim Alright, so I know you're in love with me And what are you intending to do? Is there anything that should change in our relationship? We see each other every day Several hours a day What is it that you're lacking? You This is what I really want to know Is it just me that you need? Other five or six people? That's what I'm really interested to know Not only you Thank you I don't know if there's anything to have with tea - There's the cake - What? - I don't want any cake - Don't you? What you're doing now is testing yourself You always have the most difficult and painful problems when you want to have something but you can't Yes, it's always terrible, painful and upsetting but I don't have that problem at the moment Zoya, apart from our wonderfully warm friendship I also have purely physical attraction for you Maybe I shouldn't have said that It might appear to be a simple problem and an insignificant one but actually it's not true Wait and what does this mean? That you can't have two triplets with the maximum elements... I'm going to introduce new numbers for each triplet We are going to call those triplets... Can I write here? And do we know anything about the multitude of the maximum elements? What sub-multitude of natural numbers does it produce? Or can any natural number be... - They are simple numbers 1, 2, 5... - 13, 29 No, I don't know anything about that Mind you, 13, 29 and 5 have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and as you know the field theory likes to distinguish between the numbers that have a remainder of 1 and 3 perhaps in this case remainder 1 should be fine but not the others? Yes, possibly. But I am not aware of that You know, Nekrasov you are doing well You've got a wife, two kids and other people to share all those complicated feelings with Don't you think it's a bit wrong? I am wrong to share my complicated feelings with you? Not for so long and in so much detail I... I get it It's just that, really... Alright... I get it, I've got to be patient So far I have plenty of it I mean... It's not just about the patience but for now... I also really love drinking and I love my science Yes, that's... That's very important It really is something to take into consideration It's something I could get over I think Also, I have weird friends That's true It's ridiculous to talk about it, really Can you imagine any practical way out of this situation? - Or do you just want to wait? - I think that... Actually... Nature will solve this - All of my problems - Nature? Yes, something will just happen somehow Your nature is such that you just want everything at once That's not quite right It's more the circumstances than my nature What do you mean, the circumstances? You know, we do rather peculiar work here, in this institute Perhaps it's the strange working hours I think it's ridiculous to suggest that something could be predetermined by circumstances Especially at your age. Respectable age too Seriously Nothing is predetermined by the circumstances Have you really never been in a situation like this before? Like this? I don't think so It's not about the situation I don't think it's ever about the situation Perhaps you're right, perhaps I've just forgotten what with my respectable age and all that It's very simple then Change the circumstances So when you're with Tanya do you also tell her all the details of your situation? Tanya? Generally, yes Do you also advise her to be patient? How does she take that advice, I wonder? Badly - That's understandable - Yes Maybe it's time to stop discussing it? Stop discussing it? Perhaps I think it would make everyone's life a lot easier Stop hitting the roof and getting twitchy or getting driven up the wall I'm now at a stage when I don't get driven up the wall So is everything clear as mud? Or are some things clear? - I think I understand everything - What exactly? I doubt you'd be this way if you did You think? It's clear to me that I don't want to choose Sounds extremely childish and selfish too Well, yes It's a fact Well, if it's childish and selfish it will pass quickly as all things childish do One selfish desire replaces another And what about you? There's a few selfish desires running in parallel - What's the difference? - These desires are completely different You're a man of a very sensitive refined disposition - Yes - Has no one ever told you that? - No - Hand made With both hands At the moment I am in this very fortunate position I'll say it again I honestly don't need anything But if we imagine for a moment that I had doubts or was suffering and longing to get something out of it Then after a conversation like this I would - Would've told me to get lost? - Absolutely I get it For good, too We are opening a big conference today dedicated to an issue which is new for our Institute Actually there are two main issues One is quite topical at the moment that is interdisciplinary research that is interdisciplinary research and the question of synthesis between the natural sciences and the humanities On the other hand the humanities now pay more attention to the synthesis of history, sociology, anthropology, and psychology and also to what in the thirties was called or referred to as "anthropogenic energies" Good evening, Svetlana Vladimirovna Thank you I've been entrusted to look after the Academician Dau today If you say so I haven't seen you for a while I wouldn't mind sitting down for a bit Choose where Either here or there, wherever you like - That's your seat, I assume? - No, this one - Here? - Here, there and everywhere - Cognac? - Have you already had some? I'll join you then I have a bit of a cold There's something going around Would you like to try some foreign ones? I prefer mine Alright, what's the matter? I just get nervous every time I see you Please. You really shouldn't Maybe so Ok, it's fine to be nervous I think it's normal When you see someone you get nervous - Not always - No? but often Who makes you nervous? Me? Who makes me nervous or why do I get nervous? Not the same thing - Are you nervous? - Of course I haven't seen you for a long time You haven't written for a long time I was told you don't care anymore So I thought why bother you with my letters You still haven't said why you're nervious I'm always nervous when I see you You still haven't said why you're nervous I don't understand why you're nervous when you see me - Because I have strong feelings for you - Good Lord Feelings, you say This isn't true, Nikita This isn't true - It is - It is not, I don't believe it at all That's a different issue, that's what you should say - "I don't believe in your feelings" - I don't - And do you? - I do - But these feelings aren't only for me? - No, not only for you - This is another question - The most important one - It's important? How should I know? - Of course it is You don't say anything about yourself And this isn't the point The point is your feelings You don't react to mine And I just find myself... Why should I react if I know about your other feelings as well? Firstly, how do you know about my other feelings? - I can guess - How? Well, we spent some time together Do you remember how we met? I was holding your hand, we were sitting on the windowsill - in the house next door - My hands were cold is all - You have poor circulation - Terrible one And? Nothing. I'm just a bit lost And after that I fell madly in love with you But at the same time you're also falling in love with Zoya I don't get it, you want this and that, can't you choose one? I think you understand it very well - No, not at all - Really? - Do you understand yourself? - I thought I did, at least Do you always know exactly what you want? No, I didn't say that I'm just saying that right now you have no clue what you want - We are going round in circles - Or maybe you do but not telling me because I don't understand when you talk about your wife, Zoya, myself Where do I stand? This is your position - Are you smoking again? - Yes Give it back. You shouldn't smoke at all - Why? - Because you don't smoke - You smoke when you're nervous - Yes And I don't know why you're nervous Fine, you say you're nervous when you see me Let's sit over there It's too formal at the table Will you take the ashtray? So when you stop smoking near me it'll mean you're not nervous - That will be our goal - Right Actually I started recently, roughly around last night No, I thought you used to smoke. Didn't you? - You're confusing me with someone - So it's not because you saw me? Haven't you ever been in love with several men at the same time? No No When you're in love with someone that's where your heart goes At the time of being with that person Yes but if you are with someone else, it goes to them - So it's a moveable notion - Yes Very unstable too I think it's stable How can it be stable if when you are with one person - and you tell them you're in love - Yes - I can't live without you - Yes Then you say the same things to someone else? In my head when people fall in love they forget about all the other living beings - I doubt you think that - I do I have never been able to forget about my wife and kids, that's true Or was I going to At least so far - And you never will - Most probably not How can you love someone else then? You can want someone else. This is a different thing I normally can't want without love Because you think that you can want only through love - Yes. That's me - But it's not the case I don't know. That's how I work If I want someone I don't just want them sexually I also want to take care of them to know them better You won't have time for everyone Are you concerned about my time? About you, rather I think if you're in love with me you should at least pretend that you've left everything behind - and fell in love with me - Pretend? At least instead of telling others So pretending is better than being genuine? And I thought I should tell my wife - That you're in love with someone else? - Yes To hurt her? So that it wouldn't be lies - and hypocrisy, as you put it - Wait No, it's not fair at all - It's to make you feel better - Actually, I told you first And then my wife But you only told your wife to make yourself feel better Right? You've come clean and feeling better for it And she gets to suffer You're fine, and everyone suffers I feel fucking awful - And why is that? - Because of all this I am honest with everybody, but... But I haven't achieved anything You didn't get any? Of course not Funny, isn't it? - Well, actually... - You really wanted it and got none Nekrasov, come on - Of course I did - You did That's the problem you turn "want" into "love" Yes You'll get some if you say you want them Don't turn it into some... I don't know Some love story. "I love you", "I am in love with you" Nobody will believe you. You can't be in love with 10 people You fall in love and forget about everybody else Or just say - I want you - You drink a lot, Svetlana - Less than you, or more? - I'm larger - Maybe, I am more nervous - Why would you be? - Because I haven't seen you for ages because you're saying all this nonsense to me And you keep talking and talking, I just can't listen anymore Listen to me talk? Listen to you talk about being in love with me I stopped because I thought it started to bore you - These things never bore - Really? Nekrasov, pick a direction - Fine - It's all very simple - What is fine? - What do you want? - Me? - Yes I think the same that you do Cognac. No? Wrong guess Not the widest bed No, not the widest Scared? - And you? - Nope - Look at you, you little rebel - I am too - To what? - To you - To you - To me? Dear God - To what? - To you That would work - Are you sure you'll manage? - I am sure - He's upstairs - They're looking for him - Who is looking for him? - Everybody It's about the plane Well, he was upstairs anyway Someone's looking for you - What's the matter? - Your plane There's some information about your plane - May I sit? - Of course Cognac? Why not We must have a drink What about the plane? Is everything alright? It's just the departure time - What is it? - 13:45 It's good time - Wonderful time - Excellent - I'll be off then - Bye Svetlana and I talked Although you said you had enough of me talking Well, you started already Well I did tell you I have feelings for her too - So I told her too - Well done I also told her about you - And? - Well... She doesn't really care about the feelings but is always up for sex And what am I to do with all that? Of course I wanted to sleep with her Well done - And I would have - Brilliant - Anything else I should know? - No Lovely So what am I supposed to do with it now? It doesn't change the way I feel about you I'm flattered I can't say I'm surprised Lots of people don't mind sleeping with many people It's a very well known medical fact There's nothing unique here in case you didn't know I thought it was very important to you that it was... You know, "right" It hasn't been proper for a long time already - Well, yes - So the details don't really matter You talk about it as if it's a small problem on the way to some goal But we are not going anywhere together - It's not to me - Well, there you are, why..? I want to go together How? I think we'll find a way I would love to hear your various arguments Look, listen... That's exactly why I am trying to be honest so we don't bump into anything unexpected You mean I should be aware of some caviats and accept them, right? If you can I would be happy If you can't I have to do something about it Shall we go for a stroll? Zoya, what do you want me to say? Nothing, I've told you thousands of times I can't listen to all of this anymore. I have understood everything That you cannot figure it al out that there are several people, and that you're married I cannot listen to it anymore I know it all actually, there's nothing new - that you want me to be with you - I do So what shall I do? This is your wish Do you fulfil all my wishes? - I know that you have such a wish - I do I don't know what else is there to discuss Really Because like I said this form of relationship makes me physically sick I just cannot do it I think it's terribly false and impossible It's a true betrayal of oneself Then we have to keep figuring it out Go on, figure it out, what is it to do with me? What is my role in all this figuring out? I need you, what can I say? I realised that I need you Long ago? Who else do you need? You need everyone, don't you? Not everyone Well, I do but in different ways - And why do I need you? - Pardon? - Why do I need you? - You told me why actually I'd love to change, you know to be a normal man with all the... Live the life you want I am not asking you to change I don't present you with a choice, leave the way you want I can only be one way or the other Otherwise it's a painful, endless, senseless story The main thing it's painful. And it's getting worse as you very well know, I've told you that before I've always thought... Perhaps I am wrong But it seems everybody talks about it these days The most important thing is to be honest - So you were - Yes - And what did they say? - That they'd rather not know If I got it right that is - So you regret it - Not really - It's not been long enough - And what do YOU want? - I thought everyone needed to know - Well, they do - Well, let's see - They only know your version though - Of course - Is it at least close to the truth? - Is there any connection? - Truth doesn't exist Is your version close to reality? - I think so - It's similar? I think they all lie actually So... Actually I think everyone gets turned on by the fact everyone knows So some have got used to it and others haven't, right? Those who haven't, reacted very lively Did they? - So you got what you wanted? - No, but it isn't important probably What is important to you? Well, like yourself, I think it's important to understand that you are in the world that you picture yourself in I can have my own idea about any part of the world I can think an apple is real, I can think it's rubber The first time we talked your main problem was that everything was not the way you imagined it to yourself I always think everything is not the way I imagined it Maybe this isn't acceptable amongst the physicists They act within the limits of an established theory They do reconsider, but if the theory describes some phenomenon, and if a new phenomenon occurs which is not descibed by this theory the theory must be extended But the new theory must resolve itself into the old one And if it doesn't? Then the old phenomenae may have been described incorrectly So, they must agree Sure. The old phenomenae may have been described incorrectly A new theory should describe the old phenomenae as well Yes, that's what we're talking about The phenomenae are the same all of the time However, there is one thing about human relationships people change over their lifetime - Unlikely, at our age - Their wishes, moods - They can change - They can Maybe the wishes they declared were, in fact not their wishes, they were determined by... That's what we're talking about About the formula... Yes, we were trying to find the most honest way of expressing our desires And in general, to learn something from our desires But the problem is that with this way of manifestation, the reaction needs to be... You express your desire, I react in some way And not necessarily by satisfying it Well of course There some fundamental desires and some non-fundamental ones but they are there Or you may take non-fundamental ones for fundamental And the fundamental fact is the very fact that... In our relationship it's important for me, firstly, that we have a relationship And secondly that we can honestly express everything Our relationship isn't really a relationship You mean there's no sexual subtext from my part? No, I mean there is no input to our relationship from your part You don't offer me anything, you just want things from me You might come and say, "Darling, I've brought you all this" And this part of your life will have been organised by me It doesn't matter what it is. But this is your gift Yet there is none I'd like to still be able to see you Will you give me a reason why? - I'm not always going to be an arsehole - I think you are Then we're going to keep on talking in the same old way You mean I'm going to wipe your nose for you? Yes, or... You could explain to me exactly why I'm the bastard in a given situation I usually find fast, short, simple explanations that are usually the case Maybe I'll learn finally Maybe we'll find another reason to spend time together Come on, find it then. Think of something It can come from you, can't it? Some kind of plan You cannot go on feeding my sense of power I can explain to you this and that - Give you a litte nudge now and then - Isn't this perfect for you? It can't last long. It's been long enough already Why can't you round everyone up and discuss it? But it's something personal It's your relationship. It's personal for you as well You're either going to live this conspiracy forever betraying one for another or you have an open discussion They will all tell you to fuck off, of course - including me - Then this is my truth It is Call and ask all of them to come Listen, we make late hours, everybody's still there - May I? - Please come in Thank you kindly - Were you talking? - Yes - May I please not take part? - In the conversation? - Why? - Because I've already talked myself out - Are you just going to sleep? - What? - Are you just going to sleep? - No, I'm not, I'm not sleeping I thought you weren't bothered! No, I went to get some champagne. Here Right It's cold out - Well, it's not May - You're right I'm freezing - Would you like to have some cognac? - Sure, to warm up - Here is your glass - This is mine? - It is now - Always - This one? I don't know - Mine as well It's all yours - Please talk Zoya into joining us - I can't - You have to make an effort - I can't Why me? Is it my relationship? - Zoya thinks there's no point in this - In what exactly? In celebrating something here together or on the contrary Or grieving. There's always some merit in grieving - Do I have to grieve? - No Thank you I don't think it's right or productive - Katya, dear. Two bottles of champagne - Good evening Of course, I didn't want to come empty-handed Neither with the left nor the right - Hello - Come through - Hello - Hi God, look at all this champagne. We're gonna get drunk - It's multiplying - We don't have anything to chase it with - Well, champagne is... - This is nothing like a French novel It's freezing. I do have the cigarettes though - Come on - Why do you need this? I want you to be there next to me I don't want to go anywhere right now How can I make you? Move the chair with you in it? - Shall I move the whole chair? - No, Nikita. Don't. Why? What if I don't want to? You want it, I don't, that happens Well, yes We just realised we nearly have a full set - Only missing Tanya and Katya - And maybe someone else Zoya doesn't want to join us, I can't persuade her and I'm not going to try Katya... - Katya left, it's impossible - No, it was different, it wasn't right Why? Because I didn't have any feelings for Katya Katya not have feelings to you or you to Katya? Katya did. At least that was what she said - I didn't. - But you said you did I can't remember it at all - If I can't remember... - Then it didn't happen Or these were the feelings which pass I see This is also a way to approach this issue Let's drink for inexhaustibility of your feelings - And for the feelings which don't pass - If they are of value for you, I am ready Right Katya - When I first came here - Yes the first person I fell in love with were you Right And I tried to communicate it to you in the way I could And it seemed to me that you were not interested I'm really sorry, as for feelings... Well, I respect your feelings a lot but there was not more then a fancy or interest I was able to see in all your efforts to show me something Maybe there was nothing else Why talk about big feelings then? I'm not talking about big feelings So you took a fancy, it flatters me a lot But this is... But there's... this is it I just felt it would be right to tell you about it Don't forget I then witnessed something that you can't remember any longer your lack of feelings towards Katya That was a strange story You wintessed it, and so? It happened Yes I just remember it very well, because Katya was crying on my shoulder and did not understand you or your attitude That's why I still remember Well I see. Yes I'm guilty She's not here so that I could apologise If she was, I would apologise again Well, I'm sorry for asking, I'm just interested Fine, so we have Katya. And who was next? Katya was in the meantime, not after Amongst those who are here, Sveta was there all the time And then Zoya, who refuses to be here And all of that time I was friends with Lyuba, we became very close So then, let's say the time condensed - Or was it all happening at the same time? - It got mixed up - No, well, some things overlapped - Practically everything I'm just trying... I've been watching you for a while - Why? - Trying to figure out... Well, how many years have we known each other? 15? - 14 - 14 years already Of course, I've always cared for you You are one of the people I am always happy to see when you come here to the Institute I'm more happy to see you then many others I just cannot understand Well, what do you... I am always keen to make people happy It just can't... When a person keeps making, for 15 or 14 years the same mistakes deeds, mistakes, or he doesn't tell it completely Then it means it's such a person I'm sorry, you're not a 5 year old to say I am what I am, love me - Why not, by the way? - Because you've outgrown it Maybe I'm still 5 years old inside, I don't know Maybe it's easier to admit you're a self-affected shithead? - Well, that came out easy - You're the one looking for an easy way You think that's easy? Of course. You are saying "I am a shithead" - Yes - "Take it or leave it" There isn't a better me available - There isn't - Well then? If we didn't have time for you, we wouldn't be sititng here We love you sincerely and whole heartedly Perhaps, each of us in her own way And discussing your behaviour doesn't mean discussing you as a person - No, I guess not - It's not Everyone makes mistakes or does something indecent But every person consists of what they have done Or have not done - Sveta's sore spot - It makes no difference though Because not to do something is also a deed - Thank you. - Of course! - Don't prompt him. - I'm sorry Here's to you coming back to us, simple as that Thank you Let's go, girls - As usual - Yes Do you want this? - Shall we go for a bit of fresh air? - Why? - We could go for a walk, we could not - To blow away all these cobwebs Which ones, I don't have any cobwebs to blow away These are all unconstructive decisions; we could go for a walk, sit down, lie down We can lie down A lot of words, and movements that don't go anywhere. It's just... No? Well, yes, but I think we are getting closer anyway - Why are we getting closer? - Why? - Why? - Because I think we have... Do you want me to tell you what I'm feeling? I feel sick I'm sorry, I am I'm sick, physically I understand I don't really think we are getting closer, if four people come together It doesn't really help getting closer, from my point of view It's not really my idea Although yes it is I think Generally speaking Analysing this equation Analysing this equation allows you to carry out certain calculations that take you beyond the standard version of perturbation theory In which case your small parameter is, naively speaking not a coupling constant, such as the electron charge, for example but the electron charge times the logarithm of nothing but the ratio of some characteristic momentum or other to the cut-off scale This shows that it's the electron charge that makes the correct parameter Thus, you can write down a formula for the effective charge that will be valid when the electron charge is scaled to the electron mass which is, in other words, very small and yet the formula will be valid for very large scales You'll discover that when the scale is really very large the charge becomes infinite which means that your description of the theory in terms of gauge fields and fermions is now wrong Because terms with higher derivatives become more significant - I see - Comrade Demidova the journalist, is here Could you wait in the Theoretical Department to be interviewed? - May I go to D1, to powder my nose? - Yes, of course - Shall we bring you some coffee? - Good idea I need some matches - And cigarettes too? - To light cigarettes - There you go then - I've got some cigarettes already Look, what a pretty girl So many cigarettes... I mean, so many matches. Who'd have thought - Anyway, come back soon - I will - Would you like some fritters to go? - Sure You would? Come with me They are courgette ones - Courgettes? - Yes May I have one? Do you have any sour cream? No? - Don't just... - Thanks Imagine the world where everyone must know the laws of physics what law would you choose? It's a strange question The laws of physics are here and cannot be eliminated and what is not yet discovered I cannot eliminate either There aren't two laws describing the same phenomenon You have laws... You have different ways to describe physical phenomena which are more or less precise So the laws of physics are not like the laws of human society these are not some rules of behavior They are not the rules you do or do not follow These are just properties of nature And natures' properties which are more important or essential than others They are all important by definition Alright, I will rephrase the question Someone who has no knowledge of physics What should they know? They should know that nature can be described So any observed phenomenon can be understood and described and later reproduced From the scientific point of view? Yes, experimentally, in the lab What about professional success and love? Do they coexist or eliminate one another? A person happily in love, is more likely to succeed professionally Inspiration is such a thing that... Do you think your wife would have married you if you had been a simple labourer? Would this play a part in her decision? Well, that's an academic question, quite an abstract one Had I been a "simple labourer" I wouldn't have met my wife in the first place Had she been a simple labourer, then maybe So you think what you do is not that important for her? Or is it a part of you? I think it is a part of me But if I did chemistry rather than physics it wouldn't have mattered And if I were... I don't know... A miner, I'd have other interests and maybe she wouldn't be interested in me I couldn't tell you for sure Your destiny is... You can't just change one thing and expect everything else to remain the same Everything is interconnected To some extent Since we're on the subject of marriage What does betrayal mean for you? In marriage? Yes And in friendship Betrayal is always the same: to leave your loved one vulnerable in some kind of danger or threat or to push them towards this danger consciously Or to do something which devalues your relationship Such as? Well, for example
