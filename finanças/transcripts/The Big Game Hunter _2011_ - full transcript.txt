Korean Film The secret of this picture was made public by the statement of... Yamashita Tomoyuki, commander of the 14th detached army, who was executed as a war criminal after the defeat of Japan. Based on a truth, this film shows an atrocity committed by the Japs in Korea. The Big Game Hunter A real descendant of a famous game hunter! Show your skill, too, sir, before promotion to a company commander. Promotion? Didn't you hear? Today there'll be a secret meeting in the general headquarters. Something inauspicious. - Secret meeting? Disbanded. Disbanded. The Japs forced the emperor to disband our army. Japanese imperialists disbanded Korean Army by force on Aug. 1, 1907. It rains It rains... - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Ko Sok, what's this? It's the funeral of the Korean Army. Company commander! - Want to die all? Foul ministers sold away our army. We are holding funeral of its soul. It blows. The soldiers of this country... I can't live seeing my country trampled by the barbarians. I can't live hearing the ruined deplore. I can't live as a servant of the Japanese emperor. Thank you for your presence. Are you determined now? I can't follow you, Thae Uk. What? After her father's suicide my wife's got ill. How could I leave my children... The ruined country is longing for heroes. Let's fight the Japs together and restore the country. We failed to defend her even in army uniforms. I failed to do my filial duty to the country. Now I want to defend my poor children at least. You're no longer my friend. Woio! Woio! You've got it thanks to me, dad. lt's the biggest bear we've ever hunted. Right. Blood there, sister! Where? - On your leg. No. You told me bears become mad to smell blood. Poor thing! You needn't worry. No venture no game. Never do it again. Father is best to wind up today's hunting. Next me, watching. You, luring is a failure, sister. Why? - You made dad worry. Dad will never feel at ease after marrying you off. What? - Did l say wrong? Want to be beaten up? Stop! - Catch me now. Pusan Port Stop! What's this? Open it. Wait. Yes. I was told of it. Please. Come, now. Government-general of Korea Commissioner of state affairs, the emperor sent this again. He was very sorry about the previous failure. He said the fate of the empire depends on this operation. I see. Who is that...? She is a camera woman. She'll record this historical operation. Vice commissioner. - Yes. Any news from Yoshino? He said they'd soon be here. Sir. - Speak. The advance party disappeared leaving nothing. Perhaps the game of the virgin forest ate all of... Shut up! What's the measure? We've found a Korean hunter there. He can lead us. Don't you know this is a top secret? Alright. Kill him after using him. Yes. Form a special land survey group (SLSG) at once. Yes. What is the group to do there? Why is Jin Sok missing? Well, where could he be? Jin Sok! Dad! Jin Sok caught an otter. But you none, dad. Don't say it too soon. Oh, dad. Well... I put a snarl around here. - Here? I wonder what's been caught. Dad, that is ... - A shoe? Who could come to this virgin forest? Hello! Hello! Dad, our house is open. Perhaps uncle Tok Man has come, dad? But we are not to meet today. Here. "An urgent matter to discuss with you. Come with Jin Hae in a few days. - Tok Man -" Ain't I right, dad? How nice! - Wonderful! What's this dress, dad? This is a bride's costume. - Bride? What's this, dad? - Jokduri - a bride's headpiece. And this? - Women's camellia hair oil. Camellia oil? - Yes. And what's this? How sweet! Look, dad. Beautiful, isn't she, dad? A fairy! Fairy? Really? - Just. We'll go to Tok Man's in a few days. You keep the house, Jin Sok. Me? - Yes. In this dress, dad? With your hair oiled, too. - Really? What's this, dad? You never wanted us to see the world. What about your promise that you'd take me now? lt's a thing for your sister. - What shall we do there? You have to marry. Marry? How absurd! Uncle Tok Man found your likely bridegroom. Oh, I won't marry. Dad. Take it as your mother's will. This is your mum's hairpin. You take it now. Dad. - Jin Hae. Dad, what crime did you make? Jin Sok! How dare you...? Why should we live in this virgin forest, even with your name changed? Dad. Why should we live here, hidden from the world? Dad! Sorry, my dear. I have to tell them the bitter story. Eh?! A beauty? - Yes? That woman. Attractive! She's the wife that hunter. -The hunter's wife? May be picking herbs for her sick son. It's unfair. - Yes? A pauper owns such beauty? Her dad suicided after KA disbandment. She harbors enmity. - Then I shall suit it. A bear? - I need its fresh gall. This will be enough for your son's medicine. Here you are. I shall try. - Please. Now he can't come back in a week. Mum, it hurts. Jin Hae, look after him till I come back with medicine. Come back soon, mum. Bite her. This money was a bait for you! Stop, you slut! Stop, bitch! My dear, Forgive me. My love! Jin Hyok died. Jin Hyok! You! How dare you...? How dare you... You! You brute! What's up? Son of bitch! Hurry to the ferry! Hurry! Stop! Jin Hae, lie still! I'll surely hack you to pieces. Hey, hurry away! How could you do this? Will you leave or die? This is my house and my land forever. What? Sister! - Aunt! Sister! What's this? Stars are numerous in the vast sky But no star shines for our nation Stateless, people wander here and there Anywhere they go Oh, it's pitch dark My love, it seems yesterday that we began to live here. Now Jin Hae is going to marry. Jin Hae, go ahead. Take care. - Yes. Tu Song. - Yes. Oh! - Why? Korean costume suits you well, sir. Think so? - Yes. "Being of the same ancestors" is top priority now. You needn't go Hesan. Stay here. - Yes? Aren't you to see the likely bride? Buy a new dress in the market. Take it. And buy a souvenir for the girl. lt's said a mirror is girls' fashion. Here. - Thank you. Jin Hae, don't look away. Hurry. Will she like it? Euh?! - Oh! Heavens! - Oh, no! Are you blind? - Very sorry. Old man! Is that all? So sorry. Where's your manner? What? You little thing! - Don't be foolish. You! Let it go. - Stop. Buy a new one with this. Run and buy a new one. - Thank you. Dad. - Alright. Let's go. Hurry. Why, him! Ko Sok, to meet you here! Welcome! - Glad to see you! Say hello to him. - You've grown more beautiful. Now please. What are these furs...? - I've saved so far. Want to add a bit to her life. Was the boy born here? No. - Then? His parents died of hunger. He wandered all the country. Almost dead, he was saved by a Japanese fur factor, Sasaki. Then he lives with Japs? Parentless, he's a bit rude but merciful. It's hard to find a boy who can keep a family. Right. Is uncle Tok Man in? - He's come! He is normal, isn't he? Welcome! -Tu Song! He's the boy. Why, you?! Acquainted with each other? - Of course. Jin Hae, perhaps it's ties, too. Hey, hurry! Off! Bind him. Why this? Your real name is Kim Ko Sok, isn't it? You mean he's our guide? Yes. And why jail him? Find another one. No one can replace him. He's like a pheasant sitting on eggs. He has a beautiful daughter. She's going to marry my servant. You mean she's a human sacrifice? Kim Ko Sok, My sworn enemy! Were it not for the task from Government General, I'd... Have a smoke. Smoke. You look familiar. Didn't you kill men before? I killed beasts, not men. Sorry. I've mistaken you. But you can't get away easily. Concealing identity is a big sin. But there's a way out. Lead us to the top of Mt. Paektu. Then you'll remain alive. I'm a hunter, not a guide. Pity. I won't force you to. I only recommended it for you. Why are they so late? Dad! Let it go. Jin Hae! My Jin Hae? They said they'd kill all your family if you don't obey. What shall we do now? It's in revenge for my father. You mean Yoshino is the son of the Jap who killed your wife? Go with him? Want to die? It was for my children that l've lived stateless so far. I can't let them killed. - Jun Bom. He seems not to recognize me. I'll flee on the way in the primeval forest. If things go differently...? I'll never die before my kids are safe. Send them to the appointed place after l've fled away. He hasn't showed up. lf... Never mind. Even animals are desperate to save offspring. You said it. He's coming. Dad! Dad. - Jin Hae. Dad. - Yes. Don't be afraid. You look like going for game hunting. In case you'd become the victim of the game. With me here, free my daughter now. Yes I will. - Dad. Go to uncle Tok Man. - No. I'll be with you. Don't worry about me. I can't let you alone. Obey me. - Dad. You shouldn't decline her filial request. lf not you have two faces... Are you still angry? I didn't go for your safety. Nonsense. I'm not so much old. Why do the Japs come here? You are a regular Hercules. All caring of it, I feel uneasy. Never mind. Dear. -Who's there? I'm Jin Sok. Uncle. - You, how come? Dad hasn't come back. Hurry in. Yes? He must have recognized your father. Unusual. They even took away Jin Hae. What's this? - I must save dad and sister. But how? Jin Sok! - What shall we do? Why take the gun, dear? I got it for hunting. Perhaps it's time to use it. Boss, he is speeding up. Unusual. Gentaro, is this the right way to our goal? Well... I'm not certain. What? Now let's have a rest here. Rest! Here is infested with hundreds of wolves. Wolves? Sir, Tamura seems very critical. What? Tamura! What's up? - He complains severe stomachache. No one can drop halfway. Can't you walk? The Empire will remember you even in far future. Start now. Are they really a land survey group? Killing even their colleague, they won't let us alone. We must flee tonight at any cost. We shall put up here tonight. - Here? The path will be rougher now. Get ready to camp. Keep a close watch on the hunter. - Understood. Kim Ko Sok, he must have recognized me. What does he rely on...? - The primeval forest, maybe. You shouldn't let him keep the gun any more. He'll fire first at the game to save his daughter. He's seeking a chance. We shouldn't surprise him first. Give this fur to my likely brother. Good for a cap. That'll make a good cap. Give it to me, the bridegroom, now. Bridegroom? I heard in the market that girls like mirrors best. Better mirror the face of the dog faithful to a Jap. Dog's face? My master loves Koreans. He saved my life. What? - I feel drunk. What's in your box? They hold it as dear as their ancestral tablet. I don't know. Why are you waiting? Go. Dad. - Are you ready? You flee first at dawn. I'll follow you soon after luring them away. They will be prey of the beasts then. What's that? Man or ghost? Kamakuti, what's up? There's a man or a ghost coming. A man? Stop! Where are you going? Me? Why should a woman enter a bush alone? I ask you where are you off to? - You fool. I mean this. - What's this? Piss. - Oh, I know. You may go. - Yes. A fire! Jin Sok! Jin Sok! What's this? Jin Sok. Come! Mr. Kim. Then he is your son? He approached your tent last night. My men thought he was going to kill you. Jin Sok. Dad! How did you come here? Jin Sok. - Dad. Any news from them? - A report from them. "Reached appointed place in 3 days. Leave for the goal on 4. -Yoshino-" They'll reach the goal in 2 days. Shall I carry it for you, Tu Song? - No, sir. l will. What is in that box? Why do they keep it so dear? Give me your hand. Hold tight. Don't let it go. Dad. - Don't worry. I'll lead them to the bog tomorrow. Remember. This is the last opportunity for us. But the bog... That's where we can entrap them. Jin Sok, go to bed first. - Yes, I'll. Water, please. - Yes. Here, dad. Give me some more twine. Yoshino, I can't walk any more. Give me half the pledge here. Right now. Want to become a condor? - How do you mean a condor? Condors don't fight for food but eat what eagles leave over instead. Don't despise me. I can also become an eagle for the Japanese Empire, if that is a border signpost enlarging Japan's territory. You're to superintend the sacrifice on Mt. Paektu. You have to know now. Show him. Why, this is... The Government-General of Korea met secretly before our departure. During the 10 years after annexation we killed numerous Koreans, Smashing March 1 uprising and Righteous Army units. But their rebellious spirit is growing stronger. It's because their spiritual support exists giving them a hope that they will be freed from slavery any day. (Governor-general of Korea) What's their spiritual support? It's Mt. Paektu. Mt. Paektu?! Any nation has its own ancestral mountain. Not only that. The main reason of explosive increase of their rebellious spirit is... What's it? 2 years after annexation meteors darted one after another... across Mangyong Peak and Mt. Ryongak. Koreans regard it as spirits of a savior given by Mt. Paektu. They believe the savior will surely destroy Japan and liberate Korea. If we do not destroy the hope rooted in their hearts now, we can't enslave them up. Damn them! We must kill them all, just as our ancestors did Ainus in Hokkaido. Akashi, will you do slavery for them after that? Then how can you get rid of their rebellious spirit? We can. The cabinet has long prepared "Operation of SLSG" for it. Now I'll tell you the gist. Look there. If so, I can also fight like eagles. But why should we do it secretly? In crisis, even a mouse bites a cat. Koreans will never sit idle if they know it. I see. Korean saying goes: "Over shoes, over boots". It's a top secret till the operation ends. You ought to kill Tu Song, your servant. I spent so much money for him. But I'll suppose that he is a sacrifice for this operation. How do you mean, a luck for me? Your heart was weakened by the accident at the cliff. And I found a nest of herring gull. - In this mountain? They live only around here. It's eggs are very good for heart disease. Really? Where's the nest? It's not free. You know much of business now. What do you want from me? - It's your life. Life? How do you mean? I mean I need your life. - Don't say so freely. It's said even a mere bird repaid its rescuer. I can also do the same. Shut up! I was so foolish to think you are different from the Japs. Vicious Japs! Want to kill all of us for that plot? What plot? Tu Song, let it go first and say. Devil, back in the hell. Why this? Don't. Don't look back. None of your dirty face. Don't blame me. A stooge must die. Kill me. Hurry. Then flee at once together with your father. Do you know the Japs' plot? The thing in the box l am carrying is... - What is it? Found him? - His body is under the falls. And Tu Song? - He ran away. What? Go and bring me his head at once. Yes. I'm not sparing a dog's life, but a bit of conscience left in you. Can we really go across this bog? - l have to verify the road. Jin Sok, let's find the way with me. Let me go, too, dad. Wait here. Let's go, Jin Sok. Take a blow now. Jin Sok, hurry. Send a signal to Jin Hae. - Woio! Woio! What signal is that? - It means dad drowned in the bog. Woio! Sir, she may run away. Araki. - Yes. Follow me up. Hurry. They've run away, sir. Damn it. Capture them at once. Children, go ahead. Stop! - Here's a bog! Stop! Hurry up. Damn you! That way! Dad, hurry. The bog will detain them. - Nice. Dad won them! Bastards, be preys of game in the forest. Jin Hae, did Tu Song really get rid of Sasaki? Yes. - He's also a Korean. But why suddenly? What's up? Anything happened? Speak. Dad, d'you know why the Japs are sneaking into Mt. Paektu? The thing in their box is... This stake has the blood of the death-sword given by Amiteras. Kill all rebellious spirits that stand in the way of Yamato nation with it. Yes. We've spreaded in Korea theologist Murayam's... "Korean Theory of Geomancy" that says all terrestrial strata of... Korea driven into with iron stakes, the land and it's inhabitants will get ill to meet disaster in the end. And we already drove iron stakes into 365 noted mountains... and places of Korea. Now our job is to imbue Koreans with slavish mentality that... an iron stake driven into the ancestral mountain, too, they'll never have a savior and have to live a slavery. This is the "Psychological Tactic for Enslaving Koreans" of the cabinet. Parliamentary minister. - Yes. Send the SLSG and this iron stake to Mt. Paektu at once. Bastards! After all your plot is to... He'd look at the meaningful dagger before making a fatal decision. He and Tae Uk had sworn with it that they'd fight together for the country. But fettered to his family, he parted with Tae Uk. Later he repented it and went to Tae Uk, only to witness the bitter collapse of the volunteer army. Commander. Friends, I won't blame you. Because I have no future to lead you to. Burning with patriotism you fought at the risk of your lives. But I made it fruitless. I am sinful. Cut off my head. Tae Uk. You shouldn't, not you. Ko Sok. - Tae Uk. What shall we do now? Ye, ancestral mountain, d'you hear the armymen wail? When will the general of Mt. Paektu come to destroy the beasts of of the island country? Thee, ancestral mountain! - Thee, ancestral mountain! Thee, ancestral mountain! ! Dad, Let's hurry away. They will soon pursue us. Hurry. OK. Let's go. Dad, didn't we pass here just before? The Japs will surely come here from the bog. Dad. - You mean... Listen to me carefully. The Japs killed your mother and brother. But l only ran away from them. You did so for... How foolish I was to try save you letting alone the Japs? Dad. I've lived for your future relying in mind on the ancestral mountain. And I even led the Japs here. It's my job to get rid of them. But they will be eaten by the beasts naturally. No. They may find out the way. None of them should remain alive. I'll do it. We'll part here. Dad. - Don't. We'll go together. The Japs try to destroy our people's hope for a savior. How could we live even without you? Dad. One must part once. You needn't be so sad. If you visit your mother's grave, tell her I begged her pardon. Let's part now. - Dad. Children. Sir, there! You are late. Sorry. I forgot to tell you to get galoshes. We forgot to tell you to get a coffin. Thank you. A word of honor is as good as bond. And your children? - l sent them home. You need a guide, not them. Right. - You look much tired. We shall rest here today. Why, Jin Sok? I want to kill animals. Put away the knife. Who killed mum? We are innocent. Why should we live in hiding? I know it now. - Jin Sok. I can't leave here before I finish off the human beasts. Did you forget dad's request? Enough! I know why you've left dad behind. It's to save me. But how could l live alone? No. Be alive at any cost. No. - Oh, don't! I don't mind death. Let's save dad at any cost. I must get rid of that poisonous iron stake at any cost. Jin Sok, hurry. What's this sound? Drop the bow. Drop it. Hands up. Up. Jin Hae. - Dad. You are safe, dad. Jin Hae. -Dad. Where's Jin Sok? Jin Sok. Bind them. Walk. Hurry. Jin Sok. Dad. Damned bitch! Jin Hae. Kim Ko Sok, I knew your plot. I wanted to hack you then. But I bore for the mission of the Empire. You must have been painful in mind. My sword is giving way to anger. None of your plot. You'd better obey me. I'm not such hunter. - Really? Jin Sok! If you don't obey us, I'll kill your daughter, too. (Come with me if you want. I'll get rid of you in Mt. Pothae.) Torn off by bayonets, my body bleed When could I get rid of this slavery The morning star of our hope Will surely rise to save our nation Though the sky is covered by black clouds Morning star of Mt. Paektu will shine the way Even if I may die, I will keep its light To become the soul of this land That is the ancestral mountain. Oh! Cheer up. You are men of the Empire. Charge! What's this? The sky is angry as you're caddish even here. All want to die as this guy? Do as I tell you if you don't want to die. What should we do? Untie me first. Untie him. This mountain has mysterious peaks. Purify body and mind. Vow to each peak while walking. Kim Ko Sok. Where is Lake Chon? Over there, covered by clouds. Thank you for your help. - It's alright. Dad! Dad! You must die now. But you'd better see first the wreck of Koreans' hope for a savior coming from Mt. Paektu. Ready to perform the sacrifice. His Majesty the Emperor, your subject Yoshino and his party is just going to drive the iron stake of divine Amiteras into the top of Korea. We'll make the Koreans full of desperation and feeling of defeat. So we will. Begin. I've so far lived in hiding as a hunter. Today I'm hunting real beasts. Jun Bom. Take this spear. Damn you! Jin Hae! Tu Song! Curse your dirty island country. Beasts in human skin! To make up such dirty geomantic theory now... to muddy our national soul! What? You haven't even stepped in our ancestral mountain. What's here then? The one over the clouds is Mt. Paektu. You can never get rid of the general star in the hearts of our people. Bastard! Thy ancestral mountain of this country, Even a single one of the sworn enemy left alive, this land will be drenched with blood and tears of our people. Now our people are full of rancor. Pray send us a general who'll lead our people to restore the country. Pray send us a general. Thy ancestral mountain, pray send us a general. The Japs tenaciously plotted on to kill the national soul of our people. But desired by our people for 5 000 years, the general of Mt. Paektu came at last and gave a hard blow of anger to the aggressors. Being eternal ancestral mountain of Kim Il Sung nation today, Mt. Paektu stands more imposingly to look down the world. Now any provoker against this ancestral mountain, against the dignity of our nation, will never escape the merciless punishment of Mt. Paektu.
