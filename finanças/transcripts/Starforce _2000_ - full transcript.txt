(dramatic music) (laser zapping) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Repeat, Sygnus Colony is under attack! Is anybody out there? - [Man] We copy, Sygnus colony, this is Rescue One. We are locked onto your position. - [Woman] Thank god, please hurry up. They're everywhere. - [Man] Red Delta Two, Red Delta Three, fall back to cover formation. - [Man] Roger that. (tense music) (zapping) (men screaming) - [Man] Two men on the perimeter! (zapping) Single file right now! Look out, incoming! (booming) (zapping) - Come on, (mumbling) - [Man] You've got to help me! (booming) - [Man] We're getting slaughtered down here! (zapping) (booming) (booming) (booming) (radio chatter) (zapping) (booming) (zapping) - [Woman] This is my home! (kid babbling) - [Man] This is my home! (tense music) (zooming) (zapping) (zapping) (booming) - [Man] Come on man, let's get out of here! Clear that hatch! (zapping) (booming) (zooming) (calm music) (baby babbling) (birds chirping) - Yeah, yeah! (inspiring music) - Okay, now don't forget. Arm over your eyes. Ready, like this. Good, all right, one more time, ready? Here it comes. Good, kid, all right. One more time. Good one more time, real strong this time, real strong. Very good, kid. Very good. Good. (laughing) The boy's parents were killed. I am the only father the child has known. - The boy is a savage. How can you expect him to live among civilized people? - I raised him as I was raised, as a warrior. - The boy would be better off with his own kind. - He is like my own flesh and blood. - You were bred to be a warrior. The boy will be an outcast, inferior. - The boy will fit in. I give my word. - Very well, Temetrian. He will be your responsibility. What do we call him? - His name is Zed Lucene. - At ease, men. Today's flight will be a training mission to the outer ring and back. As that sector has been quiet, apart from a few simulations you will have a relatively boring flight. - Sir, when are we gonna see some real fighting? - Are you too good to be trained, soldier?! Did you recombinase in the last 24 hours? - No sir! - Is anyone else too good to be trained? No one! Good. Rommany, front and center. As am you as the ace, you will fly point. As the leader of this flight, if anyone makes a mistake, you will lose a strike! Am I understood? - Yes sir! - Back in line, soldier. Move out! (tense music) - Fighter three, tighten up the formation. - Yes sir. I have adjusted the fuel mix. Won't fall behind again. - See that you don't. Don't redline those engines. If you run the mix too rich, it'll overheat. - I know, mother. - I didn't catch that. - I said thank you for reminding me. - That's what I thought you said. Another hour before we make the rim. (beeping) I've got four unknowns in extreme sensor range. - I got them too. Any chance they're raiders? - Said the sector's been quiet. Maybe we got lucky. - Shouldn't we call it in? - Call in what, unknowns? Could be nothing. There's not much of a deviation from our course. Besides, it's my call as point commander. (beeping) I guess we got probable cause now. - I still say we should report to contact. - You're really starting to get on my last nerve, runt. Temetrian's not here to hold your hand. Out here we have to depend on each other. You keep pissing me off, you might find yourself all alone at the worst possible time. (beeping) - They've broken off their attack. - Where are they headed? - Straight at us. Looks like they're in rather a hurry. (zooming) No chance of outrunning them now. - Who has to outrun them? Charge up your cannons, boys. Time for a little R&R. - Shields at maximum. B Cannon will be charged in approximately 20 seconds. - Pick your shots. Don't drain your weapons on the first pass. Fast as they're going, they're gonna be hard to hit. (zapping) - Damn. - Fighter three, why didn't you fire? - I couldn't get a lock. They're moving too fast. - If your slacking off cost me a strike, I'm gonna have to hurt you. Go to manual. We're even up so it's man to man. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - Just cover your man and we'll be fine. Break formation, now. (zooming) (zapping) There he goes. - Watch your back! - [Zed] Piper, look out! (zapping) - [Rommany] You okay, Piper? - Shields are holding. - [Rommany] Break left, break left! (zapping) (booming) - Nice, gotcha! - Okay, this one is mine. (zapping) (zooming) (beeping) (dramatic music) (zapping) - Hey, watch your back. (zapping) He's on your tail, Rommany. (booming) Watch your back, Rommany! Here I come. (zapping) Go! (booming) - Fighter three, what are you doing? - Covering my man, sir. - Covering your man, you almost blew me away. - [Zed] Missed you by at least a foot. (laughing) - Return to base, I got a report to file. What do you think you're doing, freak? - Saving you. - I don't need you to save me. I can take care of myself. - Well that's not how it looked to me. (crashing) (bashing) - Attention! - It's the freak's fault. He almost shot me. - Did I ask for an explanation? If I report this, I lose my two best pilots to a month in the stockade. This happens one more time, I will bust you myself. Dismissed. - [Councilman] Is there a problem? - My men were attacked while on a training mission. The raiders have become bold enough to attack Starforce itself. I say we strike now and end the problem. - These attacks have so far been nothing more than an annoyance. Were there any casualties? - No, we were lucky. - You see, an annoyance. We cannot afford an expensive war for the sake of a few colonists. Increase the patrols but do not engage unless attacked. Do you understand, Commander? - Yes. I believe I do. - Sir, can we talk for a moment? - I have an inspection at 1300 hours. We can talk on the way. - I'm not fitting in, sir. - It's normal, you're the new man. - It's not just that I'm new. Don't you understand? They know that I'm different, that I'm not bred for Starforce. - Having parents does not make you inferior. Just give them some time. When they get to know you like I do they'll come around. - Thank you, sir. - You'll be fine, Zed. I have faith in you. I know you'll make me proud. - I'll do my best. (airy music) (militaristic music) - Zed Lucene? - Here you go. - Your orders. - Thank you. - [Woman] Mission orders, classified priority one. Proceed to Med Supply. Requisition bio agent for critical mission. Asmar colony, sector 17 delta. Immediate departure. Confirm delivery upon completion. Authorized A7 Gold. (zooming) (heroic music) (zooming) Asmar Comcon, this is Blue Alpha Seven. How do you read, over? - Blue Alpha Seven, this is Asmar Comcon. You know what time it is? - Objective or local? - Never mind, Blue Alpha Seven. And good morning. What are you doing way out here? - Blue Alpha Seven with your medical supplies. Weren't you advised? - Uh well we're pretty disorganized down here specially this time of day. Medical supplies, huh? Someone sick? - Request clearance for ALS approaching landing. - Ah sure, Blue Alpha Seven. Come on down. ALS beam engaged. - Roger that, Asmar. Suborbital insertion in five, four, three, two, one. (zooming) Auto descent engaged. See you in 40 minutes. - Roger that, Blue Alpha Seven. Hey, how long are you staying? - Mission profile indicates a 24 hour turnaround. - Ah, that's a short stay for such a long trip. Sure you can't hang around for a while? - Sorry Asmar, it's not in the profile. - Ah, you can't blame a guy for trying, I tell you. (radio crackling) - Ah, say again, Asmar. Asmar Comcon, you're breaking up. - Mayday, mayday. Asmar Comcon, fire in the comms center. I repeat, fire in the comms center, mayday. (zapping) (booming) (alarm sounding) - [Computer] Guidance malfunction. Guidance malfunction. Guidance malfunction, guidance malfunction. - Abort, abort! - [Computer] Manual override engaged. - [Man] Hey, it's the comms center. - [Woman] Oh my god. - [Man] What happened? Anybody hurt? Where's Maize? - [Man] Anybody up? (zooming) (tense music) - Come on! - [Computer] Vision alert, vision alert. Vision alert, vision alert. (screaming) (crashing) (somber music) (coughing) - [Man] Over here! - Tybek, where's Tybek? - Where's Tybek? - [Man] I don't know, I think he went inside to monitor a call. - Tybek's in there?! - Dahlia! - Did he get a distress call off? - I don't know. - Our only connection to the outside world blows up and nobody knows? - I want to know what happened. How could you let someone just walk in and steal a government fighter? - He was given orders from Commander Temetrian. I saw them. - Where is Temetrian? - Just arrived, minister. - My apologies to the council. I was delayed. - Commander Temetrion, as you may know a fighter was stolen by one of your men who claimed to be acting on your authority. - Yes, minister, I heard. - Well? - I gave no such order. And I find it difficult to believe that specialist Lucene would knowingly steal government property. - Commander, we tracked the stolen vessel to planet Asmar. Two hours ago, we lost all contact with the colony at about the same time the ship arrived. It seemed suspicious to say the least. - Isn't Lucene the orphan you sponsored for the academy? - Yes, sir. But with due respect for the council, I believe that some mistake has been made. - And you made it. Using your influence to get him a commission. - Specialist Lucene is a fully qualified member of Special Operations. - Fully qualified thief and you are covering for him. - Are you questioning my loyalty? - Silence! This is accomplishing nothing. Surely you must see how it looks. Your handpicked recruit talks his way into a fighter by dropping your name? - I refuse to believe that Specialist Lucene would knowingly commit a crime. - Perhaps your personal involvement has affected your objectivity. - I can personally vouch for every man in my command. - The days when you can run Starforce as your own private army are long gone. - Specialist Lucene would never betray his oath. - I hope you are right, Commander, for his sake and yours. - I will find out what happened. And I will take appropriate action, personally. - Asmar Comcon, this is Blue Alpha Seven, do you read? This is Blue Alpha Seven, do you read me? - Shh, hold it, I think I heard something. (beeping) - How's it coming there, Lerieux? - Look, this thing is made out of spare parts. I'm a computer jockey, not a magician. - If you can read, I've crash landed approximately 30 kilometers west of your position. I'm attempting to reach you on foot. I'll try to establish contact at one hour intervals. - I thought I heard something a minute ago. Now it's gone. It was faint but I swear it sounded like they said they crashed. - Try it now. - This is Asmar Comcon, say again, over. Are we transmitting or not? - McDuffy, do you think you could lend a hand? (zapping) - [McDuffy] You jackass. - You are a real spacecase. - [Man] Hey, hey, hey. - Hey! - We got enough things to worry about. - What's the word on our water? - Not good. Water reprocessors are dead. We got eight, maybe nine days water tops. - What then? - Pray for rain. - This is Asmar Comcon, say again, over. (groaning) - Great, the next supply ship isn't due here for what, five weeks? - Lerieux says he heard Tybek monitor a call. - Well I'm not sure, I was half asleep. - So we don't even know if there is a supply ship? - Oh yes there is. - Hey, give me that! Background radiation. If it was a signal, it would be a strong pulse. - Not if they crashed. We gotta go look. - As short of water as we are? - Well they could be hurt. - Or dead. - Well there's no time to panic. We just sit tight and wait for somebody to come. - We got maybe a week's worth of water. I mean how long can we hold out? - We can't spare any water for a search party. - This is crazy. We got one chance at survival, we're just gonna sit around and do nothing? What if there are people out there? - They're on their own. (somber music) - Asmar Comcon, this is Blue Alpha Seven. Asmar from Blue Alpha Seven, can you read me? Asmar, if you can read me, I have crash landed approximately 30 kilometers west of your position. Attempting to reach you on foot. I will establish contact at one hour intervals. Blue Alpha Seven out. (urgent music) - [Temetrian] Everything ready, Jenquo? - Yes, Commander. We can shove off as soon as your men are aboard. Fall in! Ten hut! - At ease. Men, this is a simple rescue operation. And we're not expecting any trouble. Jenquo, I want the men loaded and ready to depart in five minutes. - Yes Commander. You heard him, move out! (urgent music) Any new information on Lucene, sir? - No, no news. I'm sure he's all right. (tense music) (zooming) (somber music) (tense music) (zooming) - His last known position was here. - Excuse me, Commander. - Something wrong, Jenquo? - Permission to speak freely? We understand what you're going through. I know this must be an embarrassment. - What do you mean? - Lucene. The way you stuck your neck out to get him his commission when everybody knows that the council is trying to disband Special Ops. We just want you to know sir, that you can count on us. - Jenquo, I realize you don't like Lucene. He wasn't born to it like the rest of us. He's a good soldier. - Yes, sir. If you say so. (slightly tense music) (tapping in distance) - Hello? Hello? Hello? - [Man] Halt, who goes there? - Lucene, Special Ops. - [Man] Trespassers will be shot. - I have the medical supplies. - [Man] Three, two, one. (zapping) - Hold your fire! (zapping) (crashing) (zapping) - [Robot] Three, two, one, one, one, one, one, one - Electronic sentry. Is anybody here? Hello? (squeaking) (screaming) (gun firing) Get off me! - Army beetles. Chew the meat from your bones like a six legged piranha. They get you bad? Hey, save some for later. - Who are you? - Dahlia Rojik, Asmar colony. - Specialist Lucene. Zed Lucene. Interplant sent me. - Is there anyone else? - No. - There should be a medical kit inside. - How about those giant bugs? - They're afraid of the light. - Where's the colony? - Couple hours away. It's like you tangled with one of Lerieux's burglar alarms. - Yeah I guess. You came by yourself? - I was gonna ask you the same thing. What's the matter? You didn't expect some helpless female? - I didn't expect anyone. - So what happened? - Autopilot malfunction. Almost didn't pull out. - How's your ship? - Total wreck. - Any water? - [Zed] None. - Communications? Your communications gear, can we fix it? - Smashed. Everything smashed. - There's nothing we can salvage? - Some Tridium in the reactor core, I guess. I may have just saved the medical supplies as requested. - Who requested them? - Your biosciences officer requested them. - I'm the biosciences officer. I don't know anything about needing any medical supplies. We need water. - The mission profile said, - I don't care what the mission profile says. We just lost our headquarters. We got no water and no way to communicate to the outside world. You are our last hope. All this way for nothing. Lose the gear. - Not until we reach the colony. - I told you, we don't need any medical supplies. - I have my orders. - Look, robot man, we got other things to worry about like survival. - No, you look. I can't deviate from the mission profile without authorization. - Well I'm authorizing you to either lose the luggage or find your own way home, you get it? God. Are you always such a pain in the ass? - You mean, do I always follow orders, yes. - You sound like one of those Starforce stormtroopers or something. - We're officially designated Special Operations Force. - You? One of those take no prisoners, ours is not to be questioned space command. - That's right. - You don't look so tough. - You don't look so helpless. - You must be one lousy stormtrooper to get shipped off to a hellhole like this. - Orders are orders. - I bet. Come on, force of one. Wait till they see what I found. (revving) (tense music) - How did you find me? - With this little beauty. Lerieux, our resident geek made it out of busted radiation detectors. - By any chance, is that the guy with the burglar alarm? - He's gonna be pissed when he finds out I swiped it. I got a fix on your emergency beacon, and a couple hours ago I picked up your signal from your wrist com. - Let me see that. - Hey, give that back! (screaming) (crashing) (ominous music) (groaning) - Dahlia! - Hang on! Drop the medicine! - No! - Are you crazy? Come on, drop the medicine. (intense music) Are you insane? I told you to drop the damn pack. - I have my orders. - Yeah, there's more to life than following orders. - Not on Starforce! - That's not something I'd brag about. - Can we make it on foot? - I thought all you Starforce stormtroopers were supposed to be gigantic. You know, genetically engineered mutants. What happened to you? - We're not all infantry. Some of us are specialists. - So you were engineered to be a specialist? - Not all of us come from a test tube either. I was born to normal parents in one of the colonies. Sygnus. - Sygnus? As in the Sygnus massacre? - Yes. - And that's why you got into this stormtrooper thing. - Something like that. - So what is it, revenge? You wanna grow up to be like one of those chumps that died on Sygnus? - You got something against duty? - Yeah, murderers and dogooders give me the creeps. - Yeah well we have a code that we live by. Duty until death. - Yeah? We got our own saying here. Every man for himself. - Yeah I'll try to remember that. (dramatic music) - Home sweet home. Hello! Where is everybody? - I don't know. There's only one way to find out. The colony's all underground? - Part of it. Protects against sandstorms. This is too weird, where is everybody? - I don't know. (machine beeping) What is all this? - Don't look at me. Technology's not my department. - Wherever they went, they left in a hurry. - I'll check out back. Nothing, you got anything? - Nothing. Everyone's gone. - Here, come this way. My god, look at this place. - Somebody was looking for something. Must be one hell of a shovel. - Let's just go find the others. - What is that? - Waterworks. (ominous music) Oh my god. - Wait here, wait. - Wong, Ferkin. Conniger, what happened? - Poison. - Poison? - Yeah, somebody poisoned the water tank. - You've got to be kidding. Without that water, we're dead. - Apparently that's the idea. - That's crazy. Who's gonna poison the only water we got? - Is this everyone? - No. - Where's the rest of them? (tense music) - Corley, Tompkins, Wong and Ferkins are dead. Everybody's dead! - Who's this? - Lucene, Special Operations. - What's going on? - That's what we would like to know. - Yeah. (revving) - Where were you Dahlia when all this happened? - I went to go find him, his ship crashed! - I bet. (tense music) - Guys, put down your weapons. - We don't take orders from any Interplan hatchet man. - You got that right. - Hold it, this is crazy. Wait a minute! (bashing) (bashing) (screaming) (bashing) Guess you're tougher than you look. - What was that all about? - Traitor. - Concussion. Skull fracture maybe. - He just tried to take your head off. - He needs medical attention. - Come on, over here, this way. - What happened to you guys? - Don't ask. - [McDuffy] Hold it right there, that's far enough. - McDuffy, what's going on? - I'm not supposed to let anyone in. - This man needs help, McDuffy. - You a doctor? - Lucene, Special Operations acting under authority... - Will you shut up? Look, McDuffy, the water's been poisoned. Wong, Conniger, Ferkins, they're all dead. - Tell me about it. - Where's everybody else? - They're inside. - Then let us in. - What's in it for me? - How about I don't beat you to a pulp, okay? - Okay. - That's what I thought. - Hold it right there. - What's wrong with you, Tompkins? Has everybody gone nuts? - State your business and get out. - Who's in charge here? - Where's Spree? - [Woman] Nobody knows. - Why don't you get out of here while you still can? - What is going on? - You don't know what it's been like round here. First you disappear then Spree and Lerieux. - They're trying to kill us, Dahlia. - Who? - Council, Interplan. - Says who? - Lerieux said if Interplan ever found out, they'll try and kill us. - Find out what? - Why don't you and your Interplan spy get out of here? Last thing we need is two more mouths to feed. - All right, that's it. I have no choice. Under Interplan authority, I'm declaring a state of emergency and hereby assume command. Persons of violation of the lawful Interplan authority are subject to imprisonment and or a fine. (laughing) You got that? (laughing) What's so funny? - Hard to threaten somebody who's already in jail. (laughing) Curly did seven for Grand Larceny. - What is this, a penal colony? - Exactly. - Why don't you guys get out of here? - Okay. (clicking) (gasping) Whoops, no bullets. Have a good day. I don't get it. Everybody's a convict here? - When the Interplanetary Council decided to colonize this planet, they took some of the nonviolent offenders and they made a deal. Live on Asmar and we'll forgive the rest of your sentence. - And what's your story? - Nah, you know the usual. New girl in town finds love in the big city. - No, I mean how did you end up here? - I helped a boyfriend hijack a little nutridium. He got burned, I got four years. They said they'd commute my sentence if I lived here and I don't mind it really. I got lots of stuff to see. Bugs and plants and stuff. - And that's how you became a biosciences officer. - It was either that or mess hall technician and I don't cook. - What is it you don't want me to find out? I mean 400 dollar shovels, paranoia, poisoning. If I didn't know better, I'd say we struck gold. - You got some imagination, tough guy. - Do I? Come on, let's get to the comms center. - It's definitely an emergency beacon. - It's an automated crash beacon. I'm sorry, Commander. - Take us down as close to the wreck as you can. What's that? - A wristcom signal. - Where? At the crash site? - No, sir. Near the colony. - That's his ID number. He's alive, thank god. Let's raise him on the comm channel. - Coming in range in two minutes, sir. (dramatic music) - [Dahlia] What are you looking for? - Power supply for the ALS beacon. There's a cord right here. See where it leads to. - Over here. Oh. - Figured as much. Somebody wanted me dead. They took out the ALS beacon. - Why? - You tell me. - Oh god. Spree. - List of suspects keep shrinking. - He's our only square. A civilian. There's convicts and there's civilians. He was a civilian. - Well if he's not a convict, how'd he wind up here? - He thought he was gonna make his fortune here. I used to always laugh at him. Turned out he was right, sort of. - Sort of right about what? Maybe you better tell me what's going on. - I don't know what you're talking about. - We've got a day's water. No, they've got a day's water. We've got nothing. Tell me, what does everyone think I'm here to steal? - The pot of gold, Tridium. - Tridium? - Enough to power every ship in Interplan. High grade, fissionable Tridium. Everywhere you look, another vein. At first we thought it was a miracle. I mean McDuffy found a piece worth millions. Then Spree found a chunk and next thing you know people started staking claims all over the place digging under every rock. - That explains the shack I stumbled into. - Planet's practically made of Tridium. - Then you're rich. - Well not exactly. I mean the really big deposits are pretty deep. You need to get some heavy equipment to get them. - You can buy all the equipment you need. - One other problem. Suddenly we realize we got too much of a good thing. The word gets out, the big boys move in. We'd be run out. Then the entire market would collapse. What little we kept will be worthless. - Entire governments would fall too. - Right. So we have to make a decision. Some people want to claim independence, start calling the shots for everyone. - Hah, the Council's not gonna like that. - Right. We hear it's a pretty good way to get our butts kicked. So we take a vote and decide to keep our mouths shut. Sneak the Tridium out a little bit at a time and split the money. In a few years, after we've served our time, we're all rich. - Seems like somebody decided not to share. This other guy that's missing. - Lerieux, technology boy. - Yeah, what did he do to earn his take in here? - He tapped into the banking network and made himself an instant billionaire till he tried to buy his own planet. - When you took the vote, which side was Lerieux on? - He wanted to claim independence. He said we could run Interplan if we had the guts. - The guy thinks big. - [Dahlia] Lerieux's workshop. - All right. Stay here. - [Sentry] Halt, who goes there? - Lucene, Special Ops. - [Sentry] Trespassers will be shot! - I'd like a word with you, Lerieux. - [Sentry] Three, two, one. - Not again. (gun zapping) - Knock it off, Lerieux! (zapping) (tense music) - [Sentry] Halt, who goes there? Trespassers will be shot! Three, two, one. - Where is he? - Hey soldier boy, did you bring my medical supplies? I have this terrible headache. - It was you. - A stupid question, Dahl. Of course it was me. You think I was gonna let a bunch of losers like you walk out with that jackpot? - You think you can get away with murdering over a dozen people? - Yes. - Council's not gonna stand by and let you destroy the market of Tridium. - You think I'm stupid? Of course the Council's not gonna stand for it. That's why I have my own private army. - What are you talking about? - You'll see soon enough. - Lerieux, I'm gonna have you in front of that Council itself. - Sorry officer, I wish I can tell you how funny that sounds but I got better things to do. Like get rich! See you around, Dahl. (laughing) - Now what? - Find Lerieux, make him tell us where he stashed his water and find out what he meant by his own private army. - Blue Alpha Seven, this is Blue Alpha Niner, do you read? Blue Alpha Seven, this is Blue Alpha Niner, how do you read? - Blue Alpha Seven here, loud and clear. It's Temetrian! - Who? - It's my father. Everything is gonna be all right. It's good to hear your voice, sir. - Get a fix on his position right now. - Blue Alpha Seven, are you all right? - I'm fine, sir. But the mission was a setup. - Mission, what mission? - The medical supplies. But sir, there's something more serious going on down here. One of the colonists is trying to kill everyone. Looks like this planet's made out of Tridium. - What? - They discovered large Tridium deposits. - Blue Alpha Seven, I want you to stand down. We're coming to get you, stay right there. - But sir! - [Temetrian] That's an order, specialist. Do you read me? - Yes sir, loud and clear. - Commander, we need to talk. - What is going on? Tridium? Did you know something about this? - Yes, I'm a soldier. You know the council is trying to disband Starforce. We cannot allow that to happen. - We? - It's about power. Who calls the shots? Who makes the decisions? We can't allow the council to decide our fate any longer. With control of the Tridium, we have the final word. - A soldier obeys his superiors. He follows orders. - Orders. You are so wrapped up in your orders. - What's this got to do with me, with Lucene? - He was a bait to draw you out. We couldn't contact you in Alexandrius. You may not have joined us. But with you, Commander, we can convince everyone to come on board. Starforce, the military, everyone! We're all united in this, sir. Join us. - And if I don't? - I would hope it never comes to that. - Maybe it's time for the council to step down. Return to the old order. (intense music) What's Lucene's position? - Somewhere up there under those hills. - Move out. - Move out. - [Temetrian] Zed, Zed! - Wait, are you sure? - I trust them with my life. - What about my life? - There he is! - An ambush. Zed, run, it's a trap! It's a trap! (zapping) - No! Temetrian! (guns zapping) - Zed, you got to warn the Council! - Temetrian! No! - Bad choice. (gun firing) - No! (guns firing) - Take him out! (tense music) - He's dead. I couldn't save him. - You knock it off. Lerieux and those other soldiers are gonna kill every last one of us if they get the chance. You, me, McDuffy and all the rest. We don't have time for you to feel sorry for yourself. Duty until death, that's the way Temetrian lived, are you gonna let him down? Look, I'm telling you, Lerieux set us up. They're gonna hunt us down like dogs. - What can we do? - We could give ourselves up. - [Woman] Yeah, no, I don't think so. - Guys, listen up. Take whatever you can carry and head for the hills. - What's gonna keep them from following us? - Once they get here, I'm gonna blow the colony up and all of them in it. All I need is some of your Tridium. - No way. - You gotta be kidding. - McDuffy, give me your Tridium. - Why me? - Because I said so. - This is highway robbery. - So call a cop. You sure about this? - You have a better plan? - Someone's coming at three o'clock. - Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Hold your fire. Hold your fire. - What took you so long? - Where have you been? - That space cadet was trying to catch me. Why didn't you send someone a little easier to get rid of? - You said you could take care of it. Crash and burn, no problems, that's what you said. - So what, let's get out of here. - Not until we get Lucene. - I'll wait in the ship. - Nah, nah, nah, nah. This is your planet. You're our tour guide. No one leaves until this mission is complete. Do you understand? (tense music) All right, men. Take care of yourselves. Keep your comm link open, watch your backs. Weapons check. - [Piper] Check. - Would you please not point that at me? - Check. - Don't I get a gun? - Zoobley. See if you can keep this clown out of trouble. All right, you know the drill. Fast and furious. Move out. - Are you sure these will work? - Yeah. With these transceivers and Tridium crystals I should be able to blow up the colony. - What else do you need? - Nothing. Once I hook up the remote control, we're in business. Better get out of here. - Zed? - Yeah? I'll catch up in a few minutes. Go. (slightly tense music) - Zed. (deep tense music) - Piper here, sir. This sector's clear. - Where are you at, runt? Sir, comm center's clear. Moving on. - Piper here, sir. There's nobody here. (tense music) (gun firing) (bashing) (bashing) (bashing) - Hold it! Freeze. I got him. I got Lucene. Right behind the comms center. - Copy that, Jesten. We're on our way. - Don't move! - Too late! (bashing) (tense music) (laughing) - Zed! (gun firing) - What are you doing here? - You're welcome. - I got bombs all over the colony. - They're duds. - What are you talking about? - When I caught up to McDuffy, he's taking a breather so I say "Hurry, the colony's gonna blow!" He just laughs at me. - [Zed] McDuffy? - He pulled a switch, fake crystals. - Fake? - I had to beat the living crap out of him until he told me. - I need Tridium, where can I get Tridium? - If we make it back to the biology hut. My private stash. - Have a good sleep. - Jesten. Jesten! Come in! - Are you nuts? That's where you keep your Tridium? - Nobody's gonna steal it. Easy boys. They're attracted to motion but hate the light. I gotta go slow. - Great. - [Dahlia] Easy boys. - That's it? - A girl's gotta eat. - [Zed] Bring the bomb over. We'll need a diversion. - Jesten! Looks like Lucene got Jesten. You know this place. Where would they go to hide? - It makes sense that they would go to Dahlia's place. The biohut, that's it, let's go. Can we go? - Zoobley, take him over and check out the biohut. And keep your eye on him. We'll sweep the rest of the town. - [Zed] We need to keep them busy for 90 seconds. - [Dahlia] What do you have in mind? - [Zed] The bugs. - [Dahlia] Let's finish the bomb and get out of here. - They're in here, I know it. - No, don't touch that. Don't touch that! (bugs squeaking) (gun zapping) - Stop it! (screaming) There's a bomb! (bashing) (beeping) (booming) - Zoobley, come in! Zoobley! Zoobley! (laughing) - Wasn't big enough. Only Lerieux. - Lucky for him I didn't get my hands on him first. - Move out. - Now what are we gonna do? - The army beetles. - You mean the cave? - Exactly, come on. (revving) - Come on, step on it! - There they are! Go, go, go! (revving) (tense music) - They're gaining on us. (revving) Hurry up! (zapping) (screaming) (booming) Hey, look out! (booming) (screaming) - Dahlia. Come on here, come on. Come on! - [Jenquo] Go, go, go! - The freak is mine. (zapping) Shit. Sir, they went into the cave. - Copy that. Men (chuckling), our rabbits have gone down a hole. (laughing) We're gonna have to go down after them. Move out! (somber music) - Dahlia. Dahlia, hey! Dahlia. I hope this works. - All right, I'll take the point. Rommany, you and Piper cover me. Zoobley, bring up the rear. (suspenseful music) (bugs squeaking) - Where are you, runt? - Hey fellas. Drop the rifles. (laughing) - No, no, no. You, come on, drop the rock. - What rock? Oh, this rock? - Uh huh. - Okay. (bugs squeaking) (guns firing and men screaming) (bashing) - Temetrian deserved a better son than you! - No, he deserved a better friend. (bashing) (bug squeaking) (screaming) - Where are you, runt? (bashing) That all you got? - Why don't you come and find out? (bashing) That's for my father. - [Dahlia] Zed, look. - Is that what I think it is? - This was Lerieux's secret. - That's why he set the trap. In case someone stumbled on his gold mine. He doesn't even have to dig. - He couldn't risk us finding out. He wanted to keep it all for himself, greedy bastard. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. Come on. (dramatic music) How do you feel? - Like little soldier dancing on my head. - Blue Alpha Niner, this is Polar One. Well done, Specialist. Welcome back. Congratulations. We're all proud of you. - Polar One this is Blue Alpha Niner. Thank you, Minister. I signaled before we took off. How'd they get here so quickly? - Blue Alpha Niner, why don't you deactivate your deflector and we'll take you in tow? - What exactly did you tell them? - I gave them a full report on Lerieux and the soldiers. And the Tridium. - Blue Alpha Niner, did you copy? Deactivate your deflector. - Negative, Polar One. Having a little trouble with my nav com. I'll bring it home myself. (ominous music) Damn, they locked on. - Get us out of here! - Hang on. (zapping) - Polar One, this is Blue Alpha Niner. Cease fire, I repeat, cease fire. - Mm-mm, sorry, Blue Alpha Niner. Too late for that. - You okay? - I think so. - I can't let you get back to Alexandrias and tell everyone about my Tridium. - Your Tridium? You're behind this? - Jenquo couldn't overthrow the council without someone on the inside. Someone who knew Temetrian's only weakness. I never could have done it without you, Specialist. Thanks. (bashing) Destroy that ship! (zooming) - What can I do? - Pray. (zapping) (laughing) This just keep getting better. - The lights. - Switching to auxiliary. - You got a plan, right? - The best defense. Hold on. Okay, charging weapons. Now! (zapping) - We're hit! - [Woman] All working deflector capacity. - Damn! (booming) - Deflector at full strength. No worries, Minister. - It's no use. - Can we outrun them? - We took some damage. Engines at 72 percent. No chance. (zapping) - Do something! - Deploying countermeasures. - What? - I'm sending out decoys, confuse their weapons systems. - Will it work? - Not for long. - [Computer] Multiple targets identified. - What's happening? - He's dropping multi spectrum countermeasures. - We can sort it out. Identify the real target. Estimated time, two minutes and 50 seconds. - Too long. Destroy them all! Blast anything that moves! (zapping) - How's your head? Can you go aft? - I think so. Get to the cargo bay, release the Tridium. - Wait a minute, that's our proof! Besides, it's worth a fortune! - You can't take it with you. It's our only hope. - Ooh, I hate logic. - What's taking so long? - Patience, Minister. It's only a matter of time. - They're getting away! - Put it full automatic. - Engaging automatic fire control. (zapping) (alarm beeping) - Dahlia, we can't take much more here! Dahlia! - I'm on it! (grunting) - Now, Dahlia, one more and we're finished! (dramatic music) - Close the wing! - Okay Minister. You want your Tridium, come and get it. - Get them! - [Computer] Warning, detonation alert. Warning, detonation alert. - Cease fire! (booming) (booming) - Did he get our present? - I would say so. Didn't even bother to say thanks. - Some people have no gratitude. - And to you Specialist Zed Lucene, we the Interplanetary Council offer our most humble thanks. In recognition of your devotion to duty, we are proud to bestow upon you the rank of Lieutenant First Class Starforce. Congratulations, Lieutenant. - Thank you very much, sir. But if it wasn't for my father, Commander Temetrian, I wouldn't be here. - And to you, Dahlia Rojik, we the council have granted you a full pardon for your crimes. - That's it, a lousy pardon? - Well you may feel free to do as you please. - Gee, thanks. - Remember what you said about gratitude. - If however you would consider an appointment as Administrator of the Asmar colony, we the Council will consider conferring upon you certain mineral rights of a portion of the Asmar colony. - Woohoo, I'm rich! - And so Lieutenant, I hope that you will enjoy your well deserved rest. - My father lived and died for the Starforce. In his honor, I'll rebuild it. (somber music) Coming? (dramatic orchestral music) (light music) (slightly tense music)
