TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents NINKYO TOKAIDO A Chivalrous Spirit CAST Jirocho: KATAOKA Chiezo Hangoro: AZUMA Chiyonosuke Seneimon: OKAWA Hashizo Onikichi: YOROZUYA Kinnosuke CHIHARA Shinobu HASAGAWA Yumiko HANAYAGI Kogiku ONO Koinosuke FUSHIMI Sentaro YAMAGATA Isao SHINDO Eitaro SUSKIDA Kenji Omasa: OTOMO Ryutaro TSUKIGATA Ryunosuke OKOCHI Denjiro Nikichi: ICHIKAWA Utaemon Director: MATSUDA Sadatsugu Isn't this something? I didn't expect this. Along the Tokaido Highway it's the Akiba Festival, and in Ise, it's the Kojinyama Festival. They're the two top events amongst the yakuza. Boss Kumokaze controls here, and Boss Nagakichi has the Kojinyama area. Bosses from around the country come to gamble. Take a look, that's it. BOSS OWADA BOSS TAKEI BOSS YUTEN BOSS MANJIRO BOSS KUMOKAZE This is something. Boss Annotoku, Boss Tanba... Returning to the inn already? It's such an extravagant event that, in celebration, I'm going to make an offering. I'll show you the way. So that's Annotoku Jiro, Nikichi's brother-in-law. This is the first time I've seen him, but he has dignity. He's nothing compared to our boss. Besides, that bodyguard is an eyesore. How true. Where is Hoin? He's not here! He should be here. He may be at the inn at the foot of the mountain. We should check around here, just in case. Boss! Boss Jirocho's gang will be here soon. About 20 of them are resting in the woods just outside town. According to the man who saw them, they're not acting normal. That's not good. I made my objections known to Kumokaze. Is it about the festival? What else could it be? What's going to happen? It may lead to a huge fight. Shinta, come with me. Where to? To see Jirocho. He's late. Maybe something's happened. Omasa is with him. You needn't worry. Boss, even Omasa makes mistakes. We must be cautious-- Stop griping and be patient. We're talking about our brother. I'm just feeling uneasy. Be quiet! Boss Shimizu... Pops Owada, why are you here? Let me handle this incident. I understand you being upset, but we'll be a laughing-stock if anything happens today. Out of consideration for me... Wait just a minute. What is this about? The territorial division of the Akiba Festival. I voiced my opinion to Kumokaze many times, but he insisted there was no space. So you think I'm here because of that? Am I wrong? I'm not that small-minded. Then why are you here? This is the story. Hear me out. The place is Numazu. Matsuya Tahei is the uncle of one of my men, Seneimon. One night, six months ago, Tahei... Hurry and get ready. No! No? You've done such a terrible thing to Tahei... It's your fault. You should've stayed at the Koshu Teahouse. You ignored your regular customers like me and became Tahei's second wife. You made no promise to me... But he decided you were his. Then along comes Tahei, on a silk buying trip in Kai, flaunting his money, and snatched you away. You cant blame him for getting mad. I've been waiting for the right moment ever since. Think of it as fate. Now hurry and get ready. No! This is not right... You won't come with me? Then the kid you entrusted to your parents in Koshu will die within five days. I hear he was going to be adopted. Out of spite, I'll kill him as soon as I return. Working at the teahouse and getting married were all for the sake of your child, right? If you don't want him to die, just do as he says. Hurry it up! Where is Seneimon?! What happened? Your uncle in Numazu has been murdered! Tahei was killed? By whom? I don't know the details, but the person who informed me said there was a break-in last night. Wait! Who is it? I want to tell you something. Come here. What is it? Just come here. You're one of the better known Shimizu men, right? I don't know about that. What is your name? Onikichi. What do you want? It's about Matsuya. I didn't want to get involved, so I didn't say anything. But I saw the person who murdered Tahei. Uncle Tahei! Any idea who the murderer is? No, not yet. Just that it was a break-in... The money box was empty. I don't see Oshima around. She's been missing since this morning. Boss, we know who the murderers are! Who is it? Three men who stayed a few days at an inn called Todaya who appeared to be travellers. Travellers? They conspired with the missus here, and took her with them when everything was over. Who told you this? A female beggar who hangs around here. And she's quite pretty. Stop that! Where is she? Probably outside. She's there now? I think so. Omasa, find out more from her. And so we were able to find out the names of the murderers. Who are they? Kanzawa Kogoro was leader, Katsunuma Heikichi and Tejima Kyugoro his assistants. The three are Boss Takei Yasugoro's men. Yasugoro and Kumokaze are sworn brothers so I assume he's here at the festival. Yes, he is. They're staying at an inn called Enshuya. So the three men are with them? I can't be certain, but that is the rumour. I couldn't find the three that fit the description. Besides Yasugoro, I checked out the other places, too. You didn't miss them, did you? I may be careless, but not to the extent of forgetting who my friends are. They must be at the inn. Which makes it more troublesome. Men stay here. What will you do? I'm going to see Yasugoro. That's no good. You'll frighten them off. Besides, if you were to get into a fight, you'll be on your own. If anything should happen to you, I couldn't face the men. Take me with you. No, this has nothing to do with our world. It's your vendetta. If we don't do this in the right way, then I won't be able to face Tahei. Pops, if you don't mind, please mediate. Sure, let's go. Welcome back. Where is Kamekichi? He's playing 'go' in the back room with Boss Takei. Looks like I've lost. I wonder about that. I can't let my guard down yet. The food and liquor will be here shortly. Thank you for your efforts. You are welcome. Boss Tanba, this is your first visit. The Festival is going well. It sure is. The Kojinyama Festival can't compare to this. At this rate, Kumokaze will get at least 3,000 gold coins. How I envy him. Stop that. There's no profit in counting other people's money. Why don't you take some for yourself? What do you mean? If you take the Kojinyama territory away from Nagakichi, you could easily get that much money. How sharp of you to think of that. Why should we let that young kid be in charge of a huge festival that comes around once every 50 years? But Nagakichi has Nikichi, and Nikichi has Jirocho's support. It could go either way. Nikichi is your half sister's son, and you have Bosses Tanba, Kumokaze, and Takei to support you. Why should we let Jirocho bother us? And you'll be supporting us, too. Let's think this through carefully. Hey, it's Boss Jirocho. Stay here until I settle things. Boss Takei... Boss Owada... Boss Jirocho would like to discuss something with you. What? There's nothing to say. You will meet him, won't you? If you are asking, I can. I am in the middle of something at the moment. Please wait a while. Jirocho's in a rush. Can you make time? I can't do that. I have things to attend to. I am not at Jirocho's beck and call. It won't take long. Just wait until we settle this game. How will you attack? There must be a good way to handle this... What a problem. What are you doing!? Are you upset? Do you get mad, too?! Want to fight? Wait a minute! Takei, you were wrong. Jirocho, we won't be able to settle this amicably now. I'll relay your message for you today, so return to my place with your men. I am sorry. Please do that. Takei and Kumokaze the only reason you're still alive is because the God of Akiba is protecting you. If you side with the men who have done immoral things, and shorten my life, you'll be punished! What was that? I don't know what the problem is, but this may be good for you. I agree. Senkichi, go on ahead and get the three men. Welcome back. Stay put. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry to have caused you trouble. How did it go? About that, the three did not show up in Akiba. That can't be, a traveller from Koshu-- I verified it myself and even had someone else check it out. Then the three are in Koshu? Seems like it. Boss Takei claims he's no longer associated with them. Says they were only casual members of his gang. Not his problem if they've gone astray. He won't hand them over? He didn't actually say that, but he implied that you'd have to look for them yourself. I'm sorry. I feel like a kid's messenger. I'm cutting my ties with Bosses Takei and Kumokaze. Please forgive me. I'm sorry I have embarrassed you. Forgive me. Men, get ready to leave. Where are you going? To Koshu. As suggested, we're going to look for the three men and Oshima ourselves. Jirocho will surely come to Koshu. Did you really kill Matsuya Tahei? I resented him for seducing Oshima and marrying her. But we did not steal his money. We swear on the name of your Takei gang... Never mind that. Just leave immediately. Leave? Change into these so you won't be recognized. Take the back roads and go to Kumokaze's place. Knowing Jirocho, he'll take the main road. I'm sure he'll take a break between Koshu and Ise. Kumokaze, Annotoku, Tanba and I discussed this and decided to take this opportunity to get rid of Jirocho. But if you three get caught, and this becomes public, it'll be disadvantageous for us. I understand. We'll do as you say. Please take good care of Oshima. All right, I will. MYOKOAN Mother! May I go over and play with Sat-chan? I don't mind, but don't stay too long. I'll be back soon. What is it? There is no incense at the altar. Today is the date of your death... Please forgive me. What I just said is the message you'll be relaying. Understood? With the exception of Seneimon and Omasa, well draw lots to decide. Whatever the outcome there will be no complaining. We know that. I have no luck at this. I'm the opposite, I always win. Here you go. The one without the top wins. I got it! Boss, I won. I'll be going. Wait. We'll be waiting at Bunkichi's place. Don't lose your temper and be sure to return. I'll do that. Rest assured. Omasa, go with him part of the way. The wrong person won. This won't be settled quietly. How about sending me instead? Takei is not that stupid. Onikichi will return alive. What do you think? About what? About my chances of coming back alive? Why wouldn't you? He's one of the prominent bosses in Koshu. He won't do anything stupid. I wonder about that. Do you really think that? You're such a pest. Don't bring it up again. Omasa... Please hang on to these 10 gold coins. What for? It's a bet. If I come back alive this is yours to keep. If I don't, can you add your 10 gold coins and deliver them to my mother? What a guy. Cherish your life. It depends on the person. I'll be going, then. Wait! Otake, what a strange place to meet you. What's strange? I'm a beggar. I travel all over. That's true. Did you come to Koshu alone? The boss and the others are waiting at Bunkichi's. I'm on my way to see Boss Takei regarding that incident. Then the three men who killed Tahei are... We found out which gang they belong to. Who knows what will happen from here on. If I'm still alive, let's meet again. Shall we stop by Myokoan? Don't be stupid. I don't know when I'm returning. It'll be a long trip. I can't tell you where I'm going, but you needn't worry. The boss will look after you. Don't get any ideas while I'm gone. I won't. You won't turn against me, will you? Of course not. I can't face society anymore. I hope so. Otherwise, I'll tell everyone that you helped with Tahei's murder. If you love your child, wait quietly for me. Let's go already. The sun will set soon. We'll have to hurry. Shut up! Understood? Excuse me! Who are you? I am Onikichi, from Boss Jirocho's gang. Is your boss in? Boss, Onikichi from the Shimizu gang is here. I presume you are Boss Takei. Yes, I'm Yasugoro I'm here on behalf of Boss Jirocho-- I know that. Get to the point. Concerning the Matsuya murder in Numazu. I already heard about it from Boss Owada. Then let me move on. I hear Kanzawa Kogoro, Katsunuma Heikichi, and Tejima Kyugoro are your men. What do you mean my men? If I return their cups, we're strangers. Hold it! What? Aren't you sheltering the three somewhere? Quiet down! I'm prepared to die, idiots! I brought my own coffin! Yasugoro, I say again, I'm here on behalf of Boss Jirocho. Knowing that, do you still intend to kill me? Do you?! Go on with what you have to say. You're an understanding man, all right. My boss praised you. What I really want to know is that you're not sheltering them. I said I wasn't. Very well. By rights, the authorities should be handling this, but due to the circumstances, Boss Jirocho is involved. Any objections? Do as you please. Then we'll step into your territory. And do what? Leaving no stone unturned, we will... You intend to search? That's right. Interesting. Do it if you can. We have our own plans. Tell Jirocho that. I will. Tell him? Which means I'm done with my job. You're not going to kill me? You're not?! I'm asking you a question! You're just going to let me go? Leave. I just lost 10 gold coins. I'll be leaving. I was planning to return in this. Don't need it now. It's too embarrassing to take it back. Please use this for your bath. Excuse me. Onikichi... Otake, you don't want to get involved. Ignore me. What an unlucky thing to do. Get rid of it. Kansuke, go to Myokoan in Suga Village for me. What for? Kogoro's people may still be there. Check it out. What are you doing here? I was worried about you. Let's go to the boss. Onikichi is back. I'm sorry I'm late. How did it go? It went just as you said. So he accepted it. But he also said he had his own plans. Regardless, good job. The missus here would like to show her appreciation. We don't have anything fancy, but help yourself. Thank you. Sit right here. Thank you. Onikichi, I won the bet. Here, take the 20. What is this? It's the bet we had. I lost. Why should I take your money? It's to celebrate your safe return. Keep it. I'm not like that... You're stubborn, as usual. It's not that. I saw Otake. Otake? The female beggar from Numazu. Boss Yuten, it's good to see you. I hear Boss Jirocho brought his men over. Where is Boss Yasugoro? In the backroom. Please go in. A female beggar would like to see you. Female beggar? It must be the woman from Numazu. According to Onikichi, she's here in Koshu. I'll see her. It's you, Otake. Can I help you? It's about the wife of Matsuya in Numazu. She s staying at a cottage in Suga Village. Is he with her? No, the three men went away yesterday. Where? I was eavesdropping so I can't be certain. Boss Takei told them to leave. Thank you for informing us. In gratitude, I'd like you to accept these 20 gold coins. Please take it. That wasn't my intention... This isn't from me. Onikichi asked me to give this to you. He did? So if you make yourself pretty with this money. Onikichi will be happy. Ail right, I'll graciously accept it. Do that. We'll follow you later. Oshima is a despicable woman who helped with the murder of Tahei. After she confesses the whereabouts of the three men, kill her to avenge Tahei. Hangoro and Hoin will assist. Go with him. What about me? Stay out of it. MYOKOAN Sen-san! Where is Kogoro? He left on a trip with Heikichi and Kyugoro. Where to? - I don't know. - You don't? - That can't be. - It's true. I really don't. Such a blatant lie... Enough! I'll handle this, so take the kid away. Kid, let's go outside. No! Mother! No... No... It won't take long. Be a good boy and play with them for awhile. Let's go. Mother! Tell me, where did the three go? Stop that! Do you think I am that shameless? I never thought about Kogoro that way. Why did this happen? Ail right I understand. We'll end this conversation. You are prepared, aren't you? Yes, but please believe me. I did not conspire with them nor help them in anyway. What good does saying that do? As long as you're with him, people will think that way. You're right. I'll take care of your son. Hurry, prepare yourself. We'll show you an interesting dance. Watch carefully. At last he's in a better mood. Dance with me. What? The comic dance that's popular in Edo. Sen-san. I'm ready anytime. Prepare yourself! TAHEI I've never felt so bad... Same here. What an awful task this is... Did you kill her? I'm glad! Kid, your mother is a good person. Grow up quickly and be good to her. Is that understood? We'll meet again. Take care. Mother! Chiyokichi! Was Oshima there? Did you get rid of her? Yes... Where did the three go? Kogoro left secretly without even telling Oshima. Secretly? The three of us questioned her closely, but couldn't get anything out of her. It can't be helped. I'll ask Yasugoro from now on. Boss Jirocho is here! Wait here. Are you going alone? It's best to settle this as quietly as possible. Hey Komasa... Is Boss Yasugoro in the back? I'm coming in. Don't be mistaken. I'm not here to fight. I just want to know the whereabouts of those three men. Their whereabouts? They were your men, so I don't blame you for trying to protect them. But a man has his path, and so does a yakuza. Please tell me their whereabouts. Shut up! I'm not just doing this for the sake of those three. Meaning? If you don't understand, go to Hell and think about it. I see... Despite all I've asked you... Shut up! Stop! Don't pursue them! He should've just settled this amicably. What a fool. Those three men may've gone to Boss Kumokaze's. Head back to Sanshu immediately. What will you do? Just to be sure, I'll visit Boss Manjiro in Fuchu. Where shall we meet? At Mannosuke's place in Terazu. What's wrong? My footwear is loose. Go on ahead. How sloppy... hurry and catch up. I can't help it if it came untied. Who are you? It's me. Aren't you Otake? What happened? You're so pretty! Thanks to you. Me? I used the 20 gold coins Omasa said you gave me. Is that it? That Omasa... I'll tie it for you. Thanks. You are welcome. Otake, were you a beggar all your life? No I have a house and parents in Takayama. Then why don't you go back there? There's a man back home that I really dislike. My parents wanted me to marry him, so I ran away from home a year ago. Since then, I've come to dislike men. You're a beggar who stays away from men? Sort of, it depends on the man. If it were you... I wouldn't mind being your wife. Wait! What is it? I'll tell you this now. Keep saying weird things and I won't talk to you. Why is that? Depending on the situation, a gambler may cause his parents and siblings... even his wife to become unhappy. So what? I decided that I would never get married. Where are you going? To Boss Kumokaze's place in Sanshu. There's a guest. Don't be so jumpy. This is Kumokaze's main residence. Why Nagakichi, I wondered who had come to see me. Why are you here? Boss Annotoku and I have a disagreement. What happened? I don't know the details, but he killed my men and the Kojinyama territory... He took control of it? And? Everyone in Ise knows that I am Deneimon's successor. There is no reason why you should listen to my plea but if possible... You want me to mediate and retrieve your territory? Nagakichi, go out the back and cool off in the well. As you well know Annotoku and I have a bond. Why come to me? That's... No excuses You're being unmanly! Rather than come to me, you should've asked Nikichi. Going to him is more logical. Sorry to bother you. Excuse me! Welcome. Is this where Nikichi lives? Yes, please come in. Kadoi Sensei is here from Ise. I see. Dear... What is it? Kadoi Sensei from my brother's gang is here. Stop calling him Sensei. It's been a while. Working hard. What do you want? If possible, I'd like you to cut your ties with Jirocho. This is not my request but the boss's... Just a minute! This is unexpected. Did something happen? Nothing like that. You and my boss are brothers-in-law. It's a good time to sever ties with Jirocho and combine our strengths... Is that the only reason? Meaning? Ever since you ronin turned up Annotoku has been pushing himself. There's no other reason behind this, is there? There is not. I give you my word. Then take this message back with you. The wine cup that Jirocho and I exchanged was an eternal pledge. No matter how much I ask you, you won't take that back? You're a samurai. You needn't ask twice. I'll relay that. I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's not your fault. But my brother... It's all right. You and your brother are separate. I hope nothing bad happens. Then Boss Yasugoro and Boss Yuten were killed by Jirocho? Yes. Which direction did they go? I cant be certain, but eventually they'll be here. Kuma! Is Kumataro here? Did you call? It seems like Jirocho's gang will be coming here. Proceed as we discussed yesterday. I presume you are Boss Jirocho's men. Who's asking? I'm a lowly gambler named Hanguro Jugoro. Could you be looking for Kogoro and his friends... You know where they are? I was staying with Boss Kumokaze until the other day. They are there? No. They are with farmer Kizaemon in Hirai. Kizaemon? He's related to Boss Kumokaze. The three are in a barn... You're not entrapping us are you? Of course not. If you'd like, I can show you. Please do that. Wait here. But... Don't talk back. Wait here now. Someone come with me, anyone will do. Komasa, take Hoin with you. They're in there. Get ready. Enjoy yourselves. Extend our thanks to your master. The three are here. On the left is Heikichi, in the middle is Kogoro and on the right is Kyugoro. I'm Seneimon, Tahei's nephew! I don't need assistance. Come down and fight me. We're not falling for that! You come up here. The nerve. Get a ladder. I'm taking your lives. Prepare yourselves! Good for you! Follow me! What do you plan to do now? I'll decide after I meet the Boss. Men, Terazu's town is near. Cheer up. Boss, Jirocho is...! What, Jirocho? Welcome. Omasa and the others haven't shown up yet? No. I'm waiting for them. Did you hear what happened? Omasa and the men started a fire at a farm. Boss Takei's men from Koshu were hiding there. Boss Kumokaze's men interfered, so in frustration, they burned... This is from a reliable source? Yes, a cop named Seikichi. Then the authorities are involved? No, they don't have the evidence yet. What happened to Omasa and my men? They stormed into Kumokaze's place, but the whole gang had already left for Ise. To Ise? Let's go in the back. Stay there! As of today, I am no longer your boss. What're you talking about? Stop it! Did you think I wouldn't find out? I am sorry, I lied to you. About what? It's about Oshima. I was moved by her... It's not about that. I've told you what I expect, so why did you burn a respectable man's place? Burn? You must be joking. We didn't start... Shut up! No matter what you say, society thinks that. If we can prove otherwise then it's a different story. If not, we're cutting ties. Please wait! Get out! I'd like to help, but he's upset today. Go to Kira and wait for the right moment. But we didn't do... Just let me handle this. Understood? You are to calm down at Nikichi's in Kira. I see, I understand the situation. But knowing Jirocho's personality, he won't change his mind for a while. Don't say that. You have to help us. You are quite timid. Why is that? If you didn't do anything, don't let the punishment bother you and continue on as you are. I see... I'm only joking. Omasa, what do you think Jirocho is up to? Meaning? Respectable people may be important to him, but without proof, I cannot see him disowning his men based on mere rumour. There is more to this. What could it be? I think it involves more than those three men. Other bosses are joining forces to destroy the Shimizu gang. Do you have any idea who it is? I do. Nagakichi from Ise is here. Nagakichi? He has something to discuss with you. I asked him many times, but he just won't come in. Think of this as your home and relax. What's wrong? Why didn't you come in? Stop it! You are Deneimon's successor. Behave like it and speak clearly. Can we talk in the front? I won't take long. Okiku, we have many guests. Start preparing dinner. Come on up and tell me what's wrong. Does this have to do with the Kojinyama territory? That's right. I didn't want to put you in an awkward position, so I avoided coming here until today... Please... Please help me! What's wrong? It's nothing. Why is Boss Nagakichi here? I don't know. Whatever the reason it can't be serious. Now I see... I had a bad feeling when Kadoi came to see me the other day. The morel hear the crueller it sounds. Saijiro, are you there? Did you call? Nagakichi won't be able to relax here. Show him to Hamazakiya. I'll take care of this. Relax at the inn for now. I'm sorry... Your father took good care of me while he was alive. You needn't hold back. Now go. Are you leaving already? I'm sorry I didn't do much. Okiku! Yes? Close the door and come here. Take this and return to Ise immediately. For three calendar years... we've been living happily together. But it ends today. Why are you giving me a letter of divorce? Your brother and I have become enemies. My benefactor, the late Boss Deneimon... was a man who was well-liked. That is why his son Nagakichi is so weak for a gambler. Your brother took his territory... and started a fight for no reason. That's not all. He's joined forces with other bosses and men who have done immoral things and is now going after the Shimizu gang. You once said that my brother and I were separate. I did say that, but now that this has happened... No! I want to stay with you... You can't do that. Don't force yourself. No... No... No matter what happens... Stop that. The Shimizu men are upstairs. You know best that I won't back down. Please let me be a man. Stop crying and get ready. Something terrible has happened! What? Please listen. I'll be going. Smile as you leave so no one will suspect anything. Okiku! You must think I'm heartless. I don't... Please remember this. However it may seem, I will always consider you to be my wife. Don't be sad and live happily. Where to? I have to leave on urgent business. Take care of things. Annotoku took Nagakichi's Kojinyama territory from him. I heard about that from Saijiro. Saijiro? It has nothing to do with your wife. We are all asking you to... Stop that, you don't know his intentions. Meaning? I can tell you this now, he sent his man the other day to convince me to cut ties with Jirocho. I'm certain it was his plan to team up with Takei and Kumokaze and go up against Jirocho. Which means Kumokaze's gang and the three men are at Annotoku's. I cant back down. For Jirocho's and Nagakichi's sake I have to settle this properly. But I'm human, and with Okiku around... We understand your feelings. I'll talk to Jirocho later. Let's retrieve Kojinyama before they get their act together. I'm glad you said that. Hoin, call Omasa here. Please wait. I heard what happened from Saijiro. Given the circumstances. I didn't intervene. Please forgive me. Whatever you do, do not go to Ise. Instead, please visit Boss Jirocho at Mannosuke and explain what has happened. I'll talk to Nikichi when all this is settled. So please do as I say. But I really should talk to my brother in Ise... That won't settle the matter. He's surrounded by bad men. We're pressed for time. If you want to live happily with Nikichi, don't be confused and go directly to Terazu. What're you doing? I'm looking for Otake. Otake? I want to tell her to return to her home town. Welcome back. They haven't noticed anything, right? No, but they're probably on the lookout. I guessed right. I don't know who enticed Annotoku, but it's a foolish thing to do. I'm sorry, I don't know how to apologize... Don't get me wrong, you're still Nikichi's wife. You don't owe me an apology. Your brother has taken the wrong path. Had he even thought for a second about his sister's happiness... That is what I am disappointed about. For greed and pride, innocent people are hurt. The world of a gambler is foolish and dirty. I am one of them, and should change... The die is cast. We have to go the distance to settle this matter. Gather your men. Boss! Nikichi. Nagakichi and Jirocho are at the Yokkaichi Bay. I'll bide my time. Annotoku go with the others and secure Kojinyama. Men, let's go! Otake! The three men are with Annotoku's men! I thought so. So are Kumokaze and Tanba's men. We got it. Take this opportunity and be good to your parents. Let's go. Boss Tanba, why are you here? I'm here to mediate. Annotoku has secured Kojinyama with about 300 men. You don't stand a chance. Let me handle this. Quit it, your tail is showing. It'd be easy to just kill you now, but there's no pride in killing scum. I'll deal with you later. Nagakichi, take me to Yakushiyama. That's Kojinyama! Let's go. Be on guard. They're approaching from Yakushiyama. There are only a few of them. Surround them and kill them all! Annotoku, if you're human, leave the three murderers and the men who conspired behind, and retreat from this mountain. Shut up! What a big fool to have fallen into our trap! Do you think you'll survive? We won't run or hide. Kill us if you can. We'll kill every one of you. Come at us! So you insist on using force... Inhuman wretches! We'll show you what the Shimizu gang can do! You won't get away again! Boss! Hang in there. Nagakichi... Where are you? I'm here. I'm glad. Protect your family's territory and become a fine man. Omasa, did we lose anyone? We're all here. I see... the Shimizu gang is strong after all. Seneimon what about the three men? Thanks to you... You got your revenge? I have no regrets. When you return tell Jirocho... that with his last breath... Nikichi asked him to forgive Annotoku. Boss! Where is Nikichi? There... Tell me the outcome. The three murderers and Kumokaze's gang... You punished them, right? Yes. And Annotoku? He was injured and got away. Just before Nikichi breathed his last he asked that you forgive Annotoku. Nikichi... you are truly a man amongst men. THE END
