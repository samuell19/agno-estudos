(troubled music) (nurse gasps) (thudding) (man grunts) (footsteps rustling) (luxurious music) (bittersweet music) (glass shattering) (clattering) - George. - Huh? - George. - Huh? - There's someone in the house. I heard something. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (engine rattling) - Hey! Hey! Stop, stop! (body thuds) (man screams) (footsteps crunching) (metallic clinking) (ominous music) - Bacon and eggs, please, Doris. - You're late today too. - Yeah, got held up. Some nut has escaped from Greenwood. - Oh, dangerous? - Yeah, there are roadblocks all over. (suspicious music) - [Belle] Excuse me. I want to get to Greenwood Station. - There's only bus on a Sunday, and it left 10 minutes ago. - Yes, I know. Can I get a cab? - Not around here I'm afraid. Hang on. Jim. Uh, you're heading for Greenwood. - Yep, but no passengers. - Oh come on. You can't let her walk, with a maniac on the loose. (foreboding music) (engine rumbling) (siren wailing) (tires squealing) (upbeat music) - What time's your train? - There's one at two o'clock. - You'll make it easy. Quick, get down. - What? - It's another roadblock. I'm not allowed to give lifts. - [Officer] Where have you come from? - [Stephen] Birmingham. - [Officer] Anybody walking? You seen anything suspicious? - All right. - Okay, go on. - All right. I could lose my job. - I can't thank you enough. - Wanna bet? Are you a model? - No. - Should be. You'll be glad I came along. - I'm very grateful to you. - I hoped you'd say that. - What's the trouble? - I thought we'd settle the fare. - Fare? - Yeah, fare. (Belle screams) (Jim and Belle grunting) (frenzied music) (Belle cries out) (Belle screams) (crashing) (Belle grunts) (metallic clinking) (tires squealing) - What in the hell do you think you're doing! That could've killed you! - You're drunk! - Me? That's typical! You run out into the road and it's my fault! (car horn honking) We'll both be killed! Are you all right? - Yes. - Well what are you doing out here anyway? - Trying to get to Greenwood Station! - Can I give you a lift? - In your state? You must be joking. (concerned music) - There are other ways of getting killed, you know! You can drown or die of pneumonia! Come on, get in! (uncertain music) Here. This'll warm you up. - No, thanks. - Weren't you at the roadhouse? - Yes. Got a lift. Fare was too high. - Oh, one of those. - Mm, one of those. - You were asking for it, hitching lifts with those drivers. - No choice. My car broke down. Gonna take a couple of days to fix. Anyway, I can take care of myself. - Glad to hear it. Don't you got a case or anything? - I wasn't planning on spending the night. I have to get a few things in Wickham tomorrow. Damn! - You know how long it takes to boil an ostrich egg? Four hours. - Really? - Four hours. Imagine having to wait that long for breakfast. (spooky music) I've got this book, How To Win Friends. It says, well, to break the ice you have to say something. So I said something. You see, it works. - [Man On Radio] Escaped late last night from the Greenwood Mental Hospital. Residents have been warned to lock all doors and windows and to report immediately-- - You got a cigarette? - No, sorry. - If they-- (upbeat music) - They're always breaking out of there. - Huh? - Greenwood. Oh, sorry, I thought I was out. Yeah, that's where they send you if you're guilty of insane. - Hm. Heard of the place. - It's funny, I've been reading a lot about those cases recently. Right as rain one minute, and the next, poof. - Got a match? - Some of them look so normal, you know. To look at them you'd never think they were dangerous. In fact, half of them don't even know it themselves. Sorry, I've got a lighter somewhere. - Also have matches. (puzzled music) You should've turned left. - What? - You should've gone left. There was a sign. You've taken the wrong road. - Well I can't turn here. - You can back up. (tires squealing) - You know, I read somewhere that only one women in 10 can wink. - You certainly are a mine of information, mister. - Slade. Stephen Slade. And you, what's your name? - Belle. Belle Adams. - All, Belle, the beautiful one. - Thanks. - No wait, I'll go and check on your train. You never know, you might have to wait a few minutes. We could have a cup of coffee. - Okay. (eerie music) - The last train's just left. - But there's one at two o'clock. - There isn't another one til tomorrow. It's Sunday. They only run a scant service. You can go and check for yourself if you like. It's all my fault. If I hadn't taken that wrong turn, then we might've made it. - Better find someplace to stay. - No, you won't find anywhere around here. Look, I've got some business to do up at South Cliffe. There's a small hotel that I sometimes stay near there. They're bound to have some rooms. What do you say? - I don't seem to have much choice. - I know Wickham. - Do you? - I've been there quite a few times. Beautiful beach. - Yes. (dreamlike music) - Come on Belle, it's time to go now! (hypnotic music) Come on, we're going home. - (laughs) Fleming! (laughs) Fleming, you are a silly dog. - Belle, be quiet. - (laughs) Oh! - Will you behave! (Belle laughs) (tires squealing) (Belle screams) (metal crashing) (woman screams) - [Stephen] Are you all right? - Just feel a bit sick, that's all. When I'm driving I'm fine, but the moment I get in the passenger seat. - Do you want me to stop for a minute? - No no, it's passed, I'm okay. - You were talking about Wickham. - I lived there until my parents were killed in an accident. After that I went to live with my uncle. (bell ringing) - Thank god. Thought it was another roadblock. I've dodged two already today. - Why? - You know, you were right. I've had one too many. I can't afford to be stopped. - Why do you drink so much? - I've been on the wagon for ages, but it's my birthday today. You know how it is. - Is it really your birthday? - Yes. Don't ask me how many. - I won't. Many happy. I thought you said the last train had gone! - Well I asked the porter! - What's the next stop? - Springfield, I think. - How far is it? - About six miles. - Well if you could catch it, I could pick it up there. - We can't catch it in this! - Well you could try! (tires squealing) (dramatic music) (siren wailing) - You and your bloody train. (galloping music) (tires squealing) Hey, watch it! (siren wailing) (tires squealing) (frantic music) (tires squealing) (siren wailing) I just hope they didn't get my number. - You lied to me, didn't you, about that train? Why? I suppose that hotel of yours has some cozy double rooms. - No, it wasn't like that. I, I liked your company. I had a long way to drive, and I didn't want to lose you. You were talking about your uncle. - Was I? - [Stephen] Yeah. You said that after your parents died you went to live with him at Wickham. (dreamlike music) - Well. Have a good ride? - Fine. Come on. (perplexed music) I know this will sound crazy, but I suddenly had this yearning to visit Wickham, just to see where I used to live. How's the time? - Oh, it must be about 2:30. - Don't you have a watch? - It's at the mender's. I must remember to pick it up. - Where do you live? - Birmingham. Got a room there. Though I'm hardly ever there. Stay in hotels mostly. - Are you a traveler? - Yes. - Hardly much of a life. - Got no complaints. Everyone you meet has got some problem, don't they? - Oh? What's yours? - Come on, we'll be all right in here. Better lock the door, just in case. (hypnotic music) - No, take those off. - [Belle] You need some petrol. - Hm? - I said you need some petrol. You're almost out. (car horn honks) (tapping on door) (shadowy music) - I can't seem to find anyone. Oh, uh, are you open? - Oh, I'm always open, love. What you want, petrol? - Uh, yes, five please. (attendant laughing and chattering) - I'm a bit cold. - I'm not surprised. You haven't got your buttons done up, have you? - Oh. (laughs) I forgot. (attendant laughing and chattering) - Have you got a telephone around here? - Yeah, there's one around the corner, love. - Thanks. - Oh. - Shan't be long. (creepy music) (creaking) (attendant screams) (clattering) Sorry to be so long. (wind whooshing) (papers rustling) - Did you get through all right? - After a bit. Had to phone my boss and tell him I'll be in South Cliffe tomorrow. - What do you sell? - Have a guess. - Vacuum cleaners? No. No, um, encyclopedias? Possible. No, I'd say, I'd say farm equipment. (mysterious music) I peeked. Who's Hargreaves? - Hargreaves? Oh. He's the chap who had this job before I took it on. (upbeat rock music) Two coffees, please. (engines rumbling) - Hello, darling. Keep these seats warm for us. Couple of cokes. (coins clinking) - [Stephen] Here. - Thanks. - Are these all right? - Oh yes, fine. Here, let me. - No really, it's all right, thank you. I forgot the matches. (splashing) (troubled music) (engines rumbling) - I'd pull off if I were you. - Like hell I will. - You got it, Dan! (Belle screams) (metal crashing) (questing music) - Okay okay okay. (determined music) - What are you doing? For God's sakes, stop! Will you stop! (tires squealing) Stop! (tires squealing) (metal crashing) (Belle screams) (explosion booms) (engine rumbling) Bloody fool! - Well I didn't start it. (engine rumbling) - Well stop, he might be dead! - Stop? You saw what happened! - Yes, I saw, all right. You went completely crazy! Now stop! - Belle! (tires squealing) (dramatic music) - Let go of me! - Get back in the car! - No, let go of me! - [Stephen] Get back in the car! You saw what happened! - [Belle] No! Will you let go of me! - Anything wrong, miss? - What do you mean? - I was talking to the lady. Are you all right? - Yes, yes, fine. - Well, you sure everything's okay? - Yes, everything's perfectly okay, thanks. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) - Why didn't you say something? You had the chance. All right, you win, come on. Let's go back and take a look. - [Belle] It's a bit late for that now, isn't it? - Why? What do you mean? - Those two will be there ahead of us, and the police could be there by now. One whiff of your breath! I think I'd better drive. I can drive, you know. Or do you want to see my license? How much further to South Cliffe? - I don't know. An hour maybe. - [Officer] Pull over to the curb here. Excuse me, sir. Can you just tell me where you've come from? (trembling music) (tires squealing) - If that kid was killed back there, they could have your number. - Already? - How long does it take to put out a call? Come on, let's get off the road. They can't stay there forever. - Well, we just passed a place back there. - Oh, I'm tired. Think I'll put my head down. We could be here til the morning. - Listen Belle, I think the best thing is for me to take you to the nearest village and you to find a room in a hotel. If that boy's dead, I don't want you involved. - If he's dead, you'll need a witness. - I don't understand you. One minute you wanna get out, and the next you're trying to help me. - You helped me, didn't you? - Might've been better if I hadn't. - Sorry you gave me a lift? - No, of course not. Here, let me. (dreamlike music) (pleasurable moaning) - What is it? Is it me? - I told you before, it's nothing to do with you. - What is it then? - It's difficult to talk about. - Did you say something? - No. Good night. - Good night. (suspicious music) (astonished music) - Belle! Belle, where are you? Belle! Belle! Bitch. (troubled music) - Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! (defeated music) - Bloody bitch! (uncertain music) (horse snorts) - I love you, boy. I love you, boy. (emotional music) (moves into dreamlike music) (dog barking) (woman laughs) (Belle's uncle and woman chattering) - [Woman] I don't think you should. - [Belle's Uncle] Is it okay if I do it? - [Woman] No, I don't think you should. - [Belle's Uncle] Oh, I think I should make love to you. - Hey, you! - [Belle's Uncle] Isn't that nice? (woman laughs) (Belle's uncle grunts) (lips kissing) - [Woman] Careful! (laughs) (Belle's uncle and woman laughing) (Belle's uncle moaning) (mystified music) (clattering) - Bonjour, mademoiselle. May I be allowed both the pleasure and the privilege of offering you a ride in this magnificent motor vehicle of mine? Oh, I hasten to assure you that my offer is made with the very best of intentions. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that you should feel highly honored, perhaps even flattered, for you have been fortunate enough to encounter someone is both, uh... One moment, one moment. As I was saying, someone who is witty, chivalrous, impeccably mannered, and exceedingly handsome to boot. - And by no means immodest. - And by no means immodest. In fact, if I have a fault, which is doubtful, it is that I sometimes become overly enthusiastic. (Malcolm laughs) - Thank you. (weighty music) - Voila. There we are. You will of course have dinner with me this evening? - Don't believe in wasting any time, do you? - No, no, we Fortescue-Robartses never do. It's the family motto. (speaking in Latin) Which means, roughly translated, proceed with all possible haste. - Your accent is showing. - You mean the, uh, the result of my 42-year stay in the United States. And it's still noticeable, eh? - Oh, only every now and again. - Well, what I shall then do is dispense with the Fortescue and simply announce myself as Malcolm Robarts. - Belle Adams. - Belle Adams. Enchante. Belle Adams. What a beautiful name. Malcolm and Belle Robarts. Goes rather well together, eh? Sort of, uh, rolls off the tongue. - We haven't even had dinner yet. - No, you're quite correct. And that being the case, what I shall then do is exercise incredible self-control and not mention the matter again until I propose over brandy and coffee or whatever is the liquor of your delectation. (charming music) Of course after dinner we could always, uh-- - Go back to your place? - Mind you there's one problem. I cannot promise you breakfast. - Oh, I couldn't presume on your hospitality that far. - But on the other hand, on the other hand, if you actually pressured me, I guess I could always wrestle up some bacon and eggs. - It wouldn't be practical. See, I'm an early riser, and I know how you older people need your sleep. - (laughs) I tell you, there's a lot of miners left in this old dog yet. Rather like my friend here. May look a bit rusty, but he can still do the ton. - Without falling to pieces? - That, my dear, we jointly accept as a challenge. (troubled music) - [Attendant] Come here! Come here, you haven't paid! (frantic music) - Bloody bitch. (dramatic music) - Incidentally, my dear, I was quite serious about my offer of dinner this evening. - We barely just had lunch. - Ah! Hardly what one could call lunch, you know. We're out of season, you know, at the moment. What I had in mind was that perhaps this evening we could drive out into the country and, uh-- - The lunch was excellent, thank you. - Ah. Alternatively, of course, we could always dine on the yacht, you know. Uh, cook could always wrestle up a little, uh, shall we say a little cold pheasant? And his crepe Suzette is something else. - 10 out of 10 for perseverance. (Malcolm laughs) (ominous music) (moves into dreamlike music) - What are you doing? Give that to me. You've got bloody nerve going through my, give it to me! - So this is what you like. Well no wonder you couldn't make it. You want me to whip you then? (foreboding music) - It's mine, you know. The whole thing is mine. The whole damn kit and caboodle. I see you're not impressed. Well maybe I should use my, my lonely old man approach. After the death of my wife, I thought I would never love again, but today when I saw you, standing by the side of the road, something within me stirred. Something that had laid dormant for a long time. Perhaps it was the way the wind sifted through your hair. - Mr. Robarts. - Miss Adams. - I give in. (Malcolm laughs) (passionate music) - Belle! Belle! - Uh, is that the young man you were telling me about? Eh, well, it looks like I'll be having dinner alone then, huh? - Why'd you just disappear like that? - I hadn't been gone 10 minutes and you drove past, I saw you. - How was I to know where you were? - Don't shout at me. Anyway, I was the one who was left stranded. - Not for long. - Look, since when do I have to ask you what I do? Just because you gave me a lift doesn't mean you own me. - Oh be honest, you just got fed up with me and decided to bugger off. - Oh I did, did I? Without my coat? - Coat? - It's in the back of your car, or didn't you notice? (gaping music) - I said I'm sorry. - I don't want any apologies. I just want my coat. Now where's your car? - That's why I didn't see your bloody coat! - I'm sorry! - Your friend's back looking for you. (troubled music) - Hey, you! - It's not you he wants. It's me. (fretful music) - If that boy on the bike was killed, they could've received your description. - [Stephen] He's coming in. (worried music) (tires squealing) - Hey! (tires squealing) (questing music) (tires squealing) (car horn honking) - I think we've lost him. - I wouldn't bank on it. (uncertain music) What did I tell you? (frantic music) (tires squealing) - Eh. (engine rattling) - Have we lost him for good this time? - I'd still turn off if I were you. - Get me the police, please. - Have you had anything to eat? - No, I'm not hungry. - It's a bit late, but happy birthday. - What is it? - You open it later. (ominous music) - That was nice of you. - What are you going to do? - Don't know. - Will you give yourself up? I mean, you can't drive around forever. - Head back North I suppose. And you? - We're coming into Wickham! - Hm? - Do you remember I told you I used to live here? - Oh now look, Belle, please! - I wouldn't stay long! - But Belle-- - Oh, please! I mean, this is why I set out in the first place. Come on! - Hey, slow down! (charming music) - Oh, thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. (dreadful music) - [Stephen] Come on. - What? - We've gotta get out of here, fast. - Listen, phone the police! Get them here, like yesterday! (fretful music) (horse whinnies) - Hey Gus! What's up? (worried music) (siren wailing) - Madness. Sheer bloody madness. I must be nuts! Half the police force in the country! - Why don't we find a hotel? - I suppose we could. I could do with a bath, couldn't you? - Yes. (hypnotic music) (Belle gasps) - Well don't look so shocked, Belle. I've seen it all before. (eerie music) And to think I used to hold you on my knee. Nature's a wonderful thing. (dreamlike music) - [Stephen] 80 miles. - Hm? - South Cliffe. I'd feel a little happier with some mileage on the clock. (suspenseful music) Yes, officer? - [Officer] Turn it off. (suspicious music) What happened to your car? - Huh? Sorry? - You're missing a nearside headlight. - Oh yeah, I, I had a slight bump. I'll get it fixed tomorrow. - Let me see your license. (mysterious music) - Sorry, I don't seem to have it with me. - Get that headlamp fixed in the morning. It's an offense to be without one, and dangerous. (shadowy music) - Officer? Is there a hotel around here? - Down the road about six miles. - Do you wanna stop off? - Why not? - Let's just hope they're not full. - Take anything they've got. (hypnotic music) Stephen. (mystical music) Stephen. Stephen. Stephen. - Hm? - [Belle] Could I have a light? - Oh, sure. (weighty music) - You're trembling. - Are you surprised? - We're full up. - Oh. Well haven't you got anything? Just one room will do. - That your wife? - Yeah, sure. - There's a fishing lodge in the grounds we sometimes use. It's not Buckingham Palace. It'll do for what you've got in mind. Sign here. 10 pounds for the night in advance. - 10? That'll be fine. - Keep on the way you're facing. It's about another 200 yards further on. - You finished with this? - Finished with it? Haven't had a chance to look at it yet. Take it, I know what's on telly. - Good night. - Night, Mr. Jones. - It's okay. (spooky music) Well this is all they had. Do you wanna go and open up now? I'll go and park the car. - Okay. (ominous music) - It's all right? - Yes. Yes, fine. - Are you gonna have a bath? - Mm-hm. After you. (water trickling) - Sorry, the water's not hot. Have to wait til the morning. - Oh. Well I'm too tired anyway. (Belle's uncle laughs) - Don't look so scared. I'm not gonna bite you. Here. I'll put them on. (crazy music) - [Belle] Yes? (suspicious music) - Well. Good night. - Good night. (hushed music) (suspenseful music) (trembling music) - Evening, Sarge. - Evening. - Jesus Christ. (twisted music) (Belle's uncle growls) (Belle cries out) (spooky music) (coat thuds) (Stephen grunts) (Stephen mumbles) (door clicks) (knocking on the door) (ominous music) (door clicks) (troubled music) (Belle screams) - Belle? Belle? (banging on the door) Belle! Belle! Belle! (door rattling) (glass shattering) (urgent music) Belle! Belle! (frantic music) Belle! Belle! - No, no! No! No! No! No! Get away! (dramatic music) - [Stephen] Belle! Belle! (tense music) (Belle and her uncle grunting) (engine rattling) (frenzied music) (Belle's uncle cries out) (engine rattling) (siren wailing) (bewildered music) (Stephen grunts) (choking) (rope creaking) (siren wailing) (Belle groans) - Come on. (troubled music) (bittersweet music) - Did you know it takes four hours to boil an ostrich egg? Four hours. (luxurious music)
