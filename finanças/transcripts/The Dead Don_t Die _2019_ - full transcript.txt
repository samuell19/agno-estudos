Yuck. The fire's still warm. Is that you, Hermit Bob? We kinda can see you. Farmer Miller says you might have stole one of his chickens. That happens to be against the law. Now, I'm hoping that it was a fox that did that. Up your hole with a wooden pole, Cliff. That also happens to be against the law. Should we take him in? Where'd he go? I don't know. I don't see him. Uh, we're gonna go back to town now... Hermit Bob. Don't break any more laws. Just calm down. Hey, Cliff.

That must have been like 50 years ago. Yeah, it was. You know, Bob's been out there for years, eating squirrels and bugs, and he never hurt anyone that I ever heard of. Well, he is kind of unusual. Is it already 20 after 8:00? Shouldn't it be getting dark by now? Yeah, this daylight savings thing is all out of whack lately. Damn it. My watch stopped. Or is broken or something. Yeah, something weird's going on. Yeah. Weird. Yeah, this isn't gonna end well, Cliff. The ant colonies. All jacked up like it was the end of the world. Hey, Ronnie, you want to swing by the diner, get some doughnuts, coffee? Um... no, thanks. It seems late for coffee and doughnuts. I guess so. This is home base. Are you guys reading me? Over. - Hey, Mindy. - You guys okay out there? Yeah, we're just, uh, cruising a bit before we swing on back. Uh, you need anything? We could, uh, run by the diner, pick you up some coffee and doughnuts. Negative. Thanks. There is something strange going on, though. Have you guys, by any chance, noticed that the... ...and the daylight and the... I think the news report... Hello, hello. Shit. We lost her. Use your cell. That's funny. It's completely dead.

Like some kind of ghost. Might as well be Amish. Maybe it was a... a fox, Frank. Um, I don't think Bob ever hurt anybody. Yeah, well, tell that to my fucking chickens. Fox, my ass.

This special report: These activities could possibly be affecting the Earth's rotation on its axis. Scientists say even the slightest change in this balance may already be causing a dramatic change in our usual hours of daylight. Meanwhile, government officials, as well as the heads of the energy companies involved, say the recent extensive polar fracking has had no discernible consequences whatsoever. Here's what the energy secretary had to say in this evening's press conference. Listen, these alarmists are dangerous liars. Let's not believe something just because one so-called scientist says it's true. Polar fracking has created fantastic jobs, big profits and energy for our great country. Let's not forget our priori... What you think, Fern? I don't know, Hank. Shouldn't it be getting dark out? So, you can see from this diagram that if the Earth is pulled even slightly off its axis, the repercussions could be extreme. Coming up in the next segment... Holy shit, man, this is crazy. A change in the Earth's rotation or its spin rate? That'd be catastrophic, for sure. All the cycles of the biosphere would be affected. The natural cycles of sunlight would be disrupted, plants wouldn't grow, wind patterns would change, and tectonic activity... Forget about it. The polar caps shifting would mean... I don't want to say. Total planetary destruction. For real? Shut up. Okay, time's up, girls. Way up. Well, if it isn't Geronimo on the girls' floor again. Do you want to be a girl, Geronimo? No. Well, then get back to the boys' section... now. Dennis. Can you please escort Geronimo back to the boys' section? I'll deal with these girls. Let's go, Geronimo. You know the drill. Let's go, you clowns. It's bedtime for bozos. You two ladies, too. Let's go. Secretary of Energy Pillerton, however... Thank you. ...fully refutes these speculations, insisting... See you, Bobby. - Excellent. - You got it? Need a bag? - No, thanks. - All right. - Bye, Bobby. - See you guys. Wow, it's still so light out. Okay. So... - Bilbo Baggins. - Hey, Dean. - What's up, buddy? - How's things? After-hours delivery, WU-PS. Check this out. Got some Weird News of the World. The Earth off its axis. That's bad news. This is for you right here, for your collection. Oh, man. Starlog. Eerie. Creepy, number 61. April 1974. That motherfucker's rare, before you was born and shit. Oh, man. Here, let me give you some money. No, that's on me. - Add it to your collection. - Thanks, man. Just give me your Herbie Hancock right here, and I'll be on my way. They need to fix the AC. You know, it's kind of hot in this motherfucker, huh? All right. Okay-dokay. All right, see you next week, Frodo. Hey, Dean. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just, uh, dropping a little wisdom until the next delivery. The world is perfect. Appreciate the details. "The world is perfect. Appreciate the details." You guys shouldn't be here. Strange. Tasty porcinis. Okay. Mmm. Kitty! Good evening. This is Posie Juarez. We interrupt this program for a Centerville 7 News Special Report. People are saying their pets have either just disappeared or are acting unusually skittish and aggressive. Here's a report from Harrisville. Look at this. I mean, I just couldn't find my cat, Rainbow. And when I finally did find her, she was under the house. She's never done that before. She's not usually like that. She's very gentle and... That's so strange. Where are you guys? ...too, and she had this wild look in her eye, and when I finally tried to pull her out, she scratched me all to shreds, like a wild animal. That's so creepy. I knew... We're back? Hello. Wow, that is strange, and it seems to be happening all over. We'll have more reports at 11:00. But for now, this is Posie Juarez for Centerville 7 News. Stay safe... and keep your eyes open. Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld. Here, boy. Where the hell are you? Goddamn dog. Rumsfeld? You out here? Rumsfeld, what you doing over there? Get your ass inside. Come on, stupid. Hey. What are you doing? Goddamn it. Holy shit. Who stole my fucking cows? Where the hell are my chickens? Frank's cows. Into the woods, ladies. Welcome to my world. Damn it, Mallory. Even dead, you reek of chardonnay. Cheap chardonnay. How's she looking? Well, she's not getting any older. Wow. The diner sure makes the world's best coffee, doesn't it? Yeah, but how can you drink it so late? - Won't it keep you up? - No, I sleep like a baby. Except maybe when I know there's a corpse waiting for me at work. Oh, y-yeah. Cliff, is the coroner from Latrobe gonna pick her up tomorrow? It's getting a little creepy being here alone with Mallory decomposing in there. Yeah, they're supposed to come pick her up tomorrow morning. Thank God. I don't know why she can't be over at the funeral home. 'Cause she's going to Potter's Field in Latrobe. And 'cause our new unusual undertaker, Ms. Winston, has got those two golfers that were struck by lightning... the Logans. Thanks, Ronnie. It's not really necessary, but... Can I, uh, drive you home, Mindy? Also not necessary, Ronnie. You know I have my car here. Oh, yeah. - How is the Prius running? - Fine. Can you even fit two people in that little Smart car of yours? Well, yeah. Holds two nicely. This daylight thing is bothering me. It's strange. Well, what can I say? The world is kind of strange lately. Yeah, it sure is. If you ask me, this whole thing is gonna end badly. So, what exactly do you mean, Ronnie? Oh, uh, don't know. Just a feeling, I guess. Strong feeling. Oh, boy. You okay doing the whole night shift alone, Cliff? Yeah, I can take a nap. I mean, I can just lie down in that other cell next to old Mallory. Oh, God. Next to her... her dead body? Might bring back some old memories. See you guys tomorrow. - See you, Cliff. - Yeah, see you tomorrow, Chief. "This is all gonna end badly." What does that mean? I knew Mallory O'Brien since I was a kid. And believe it or not, sh-she was a pretty young thing, too. Please. Sorry, but good riddance to that drunken old goat. Well, I-I-I don't know, Fern. Geez, I got to get up out of here. I-I got to, uh, get to the hardware store early tomorrow morning. I'm looking forward to seeing you ladies tomorrow. - Mm. - Take care, Hank. Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams. Hank is such a gentleman. Sure is. Well, I better get started cleaning here. Listen, Lily. I've been dying to ask you about that new foreign woman that took over the funeral home. What's her name? Her name is Zelda Winston. And she's strange, for sure. And she's got these, like, really weird eyes, like she's, like, looking right through you. She pays me really well, though. Zelda. What-what kind of name is that? I don't know. She's probably, like, Irish or Scottish or whatever. And she talks really funny, though, so I don't always get it right. But I like the name Zelda. It reminds me of, um, Zelda Fitzgerald. Who's that? That's Great Gatsby's wife. And who's that? That's the really rich guy from the 1920s. The Robert Redford guy. Well, anyway, so what's it like over there in those secret rooms since she took over? Well, there's these, like, really creepy back rooms, you know, where they, like, keep all the stiffs. And then next to that, there's this big golden Buddha. A what, now? There's a big, shiny, golden Buddha. And then there's these, like, old-looking samurai swords on a rack. Really? Amituofo. That's peculiar. Now, stay put, will you? What is it, Liv? You okay? Yeah. I guess so. I just got this creepy feeling. You were probably just having a bad dream. Yeah, guess so. A bad dream. It's okay. Just go back to sleep. Thanks, Stell. Hmm. Toxic lunar vibrations. All right, honey, I'm done. I'm leaving your money here. I'm out of here, Lil. Okay, Fern. See you tomorrow. Not if I see you first. Very funny. Excuse me, we're closed. What... what happened to you? Aah! Lily! Oh, get the fuck away from me, you little motherfucker! Oh, I'll fucking kill you! I'll shove this mop up your fucking ass, motherfucker! Get the fuck away from me! Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Centerville Police Department. This is Chief Robertson. Hi, Hank. What's up? Is it really 6:30? What? At the diner? Uh, like I said on the phone, Cliff, often, Fern gets here early, and so I thought I might get some coffee to go, and-and then this. Oh, my God. I-I saw them. Fern and Lily. Oh, man. Uh, wh-what the hell was it? A wild animal? Uh, several wild animals? I don't know. But whatever it was, it even smashed the coffeepots. Oh, yuck. Jesus Christ, Cliff. What the heck was it, a wild animal? Several wild animals? That's exactly what I said. Hey, guys. Wow. Fern's really done wonders with these flower beds. Really perks up the place, huh? What? - What happened? - God, Mindy. I don't think you want to see this. Uh, no, no, I didn't need to see that. Was it a wild animal? Or several wild animals? Cliff, is that really Fern and Lily in there? Uh, no. That was Fern and Lily, but now... Do you need me here? Maybe you could help out with crowd control. Okay, folks, can you move it along now, please? Thank you. I can't believe it. God, Ronnie. This is really awful. Maybe the worst thing I've ever seen. Yeah. Sure is. I... I-I got to go. So, what are you thinking? You... you really want to know? I'm thinking zombies. What? You know, zombies. Ghouls. The undead. Are you... you're trying to tell me... ...you're thinking zombies did this? Yup. Hey, Jack, will you check your phone - and see where we are exactly? - Yeah. Oh, man. I'm not getting any reception out here. Geez, I don't even know if my phone's working, - for some reason. - Hmm. Let me try the radio. Oh, wow, it's working again, so... I mean, they're absolutely wrong. We know very well that polar fracking has been great for this country. In my opinion, these naysayers should just move to somewhere else - where they don't have to... - I'm not listening to this. ♪ And the streets look so empty ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ "The Dead Don't Die."

Uh, the Bates Motel in Psycho was not separated into "little bungalows." - Ooh. - All right. That's 12 for the CD and two dollars for the soda. - Here you go. You can just keep the change. - Thanks. Oh, cool. Whoa. That's a super cool ride, by the way. Very, uh, George Romero. Yeah, it's a classic. Your film knowledge is impressive. What's your name? Bobby. Bobby Wiggins. What's that? Bobby Baggins? No, Wiggins. I'm Zoe. Thanks, Bobby. Will the Feds be brought in on this? It's... it's really weird. I see. But Miss O'Brien... so she has to stay with us another night? Oh, God. Okay. Thank you. Hello, Ms. Winston. Hello, Officer Minerva Morrison. Do call me Zelda. Yeah, okay, sure. You've been informed of the tragedy? I have. Am I to understand that the remains will be brought to The Ever After Funeral Home for my preparations? Uh, no, that won't be necessary. The Feds have already collected the remains. They've brought them out of the county. I see. Is there anything else I can do? Yes. I do have an unrelated question. - Shoot. - "Shoot"? I mean ask me. Oh, yes. Are you, by any chance, a couple? You and the physically attractive one? Um, you mean the younger one? Officer Peterson? That's the one I mean... Officer Ronald Peterson. Well, actually, no. Why do you ask, Zelda? Just accumulating local information. Oh. Okay. Dear Jesus. I mean, that's absolutely horrible. I mean, who or what is-is-is per-perpetrating these... these... Hey. - What's going on? - Hey. Nice car. '68 Pontiac LeMans. Yeah. It's a beauty, huh? It's our friend's totally rad ride. It's a classic. Have a good one. Later. Guys, I'm so hungry. Same. Let's eat. I'll ask. H-Hey. - Nice car. - Thank you. Uh, do you guys know if there's a diner or restaurant nearby? Sorry. The only diner in town is closed, indefinitely. Well, that's unfortunate. Uh, but we, uh, have several vending machines containing snacks, uh, right over by the office. Okay. Thanks. Do you have change for three dollars? Yeah, I do. I like your badge. Oh, th... thank you. That's, uh... - That-that should be good. - Oh, okay. - Thanks. - Oh, no, no. - You can, you can have it. - Yeah? Okay. Thanks. They just checked in. Hipsters from the big city. - Yeah? - Yep. My educated guess would be Pittsburgh. They got that urban style, you know. Oh, well, those plates are from Ohio, so my educated guess would be Cleveland. Oh. Cleveland. Hmm. Yeah, Cleveland. Thanks. Oh, yeah. Thanks. That girl's part Mexican. - Hmm? - Really? How can you tell? I have an affinity for Mexicans. They're, like, my favorite people. I love Mexico. I've been down there twice. Okay, Ronnie, then you should be the one to inform them that if they're gonna spend the night in Centerville, to not go out and to keep their hotel room door locked. Okay? Uh, you know, Cliff, uh... I know this isn't important comparatively, uh, but, uh, all of my cats are gone. And-and, normally, they-they, uh, just stay inside. Well, I'm sorry about that, Danny. They could be hiding. Nothing is happening normally right now. - Yeah. - How did they react? They said, "I heard you had a lot of zombies around here," and then they laughed. Infernal hipsters with their irony. Melville. "Nameless miseries of the numberless mortals." Well, everything looks normal out there. Yeah. But what happened sounds like the start of - a gruesome horror film. - Sure does. Boo! Really, really not funny, Geronimo. You guys hear about those grisly murders at the diner? Yeah. Just talking about them. Creepy. I've been listening to the radio, and I'm sure it's the undead, yo. Reanimated by the Earth being thrown off its axis from the polar fracking. What are you saying? I'm saying... full-on zombie apocalypse, baby. Soon, there'll be hordes of them. - Geronimo. - Shit. Do you want to lose your privileges again? No, sir. Then let's go. Unbelievable. Cliff, why'd they used to separate the children's graves from the adults'? Don't know. Some kind of a 19th-century thing. Huh. Seems like a bad idea somehow. Yeah. So, what exactly are we looking for here? Zombies? Hey, look over here. Here's another one. Oh, man. This isn't gonna end well. Goddamn it. Ghouls. This is undead, reanimated, full-on, flesh-eating zombie shit. No question. I was supposed to retire. - Two years ago. - I know. - Why didn't you? - What? Retire two years ago. Are we improvising here? No, I was just asking. But I probably know the answer anyway. Probably. Yeah. So, is our plan to continue to inform people about the zombie danger before it gets dark? Oh, God, Ronnie. Uh... I guess so. Because we passed Farmer Miller's place a little while ago. Do we need to inform him? Fuck Farmer Miller. Really? He is a citizen of Centerville. You're right. Uh... We'll have Mindy call him. Oh, okay. So, Ronnie, how the fuck do you kill a zombie? Well, you got to kill the head. - "Kill the head." - Yeah. By any means necessary, kill the head. Decapitate. It's the only way to kill them. Jesus. And that's really the only way to stop zombies, is to kill the head, Hank. I know it's gruesome, but complete decapitation. Doesn't matter if you use a-a machete, steel wire, hedge clippers, whatever. Just as long as the spinal cord is severed, right? And the head... is cut off. And that's it. De-animated. Only way to kill the dead: kill the head. Uh, wait, Bobby. I-I'm not so sure it was zombies. You said they ate Lily and Fern's flesh. Usually, they go for the brains. It's unusual, but... it's still cannibals, man. Mm. Definitely zombies. Okay? Hank, you can trust me. I've seen almost every zombie film ever made. Mm. This is zombie shit going down, and we got to get prepared. I don't know what to think anymore. Hank, the shells. Oh, yeah. Better safe than sorry. Yeah, you're right. Safe than sorry. Just kill the head. Several other shocking and brutal attacks occurred in this residential neighborhood just outside East Brady. The images are just too gruesome to broadcast at this time, and police are saying that it almost looked like the victims were attacked by a wild animal or perhaps several wild animals. Police did provide this map showing where these... Goddamn it, my watch doesn't fucking work. I just got it. It's mad expensive. Holy shit, dude, this is insane. Wow. Maybe that Harry Potter guy at the gas station wasn't kidding, man. What, about-about what? About there being zombies around here. That's not even funny. Don't joke. It's really, really creepy. Authorities are warning all citizens to stay inside and keep all doors and windows locked and secured. Zack, lock the door, will you? - Got you. - But for now, this is Posie Juarez for Centerville 7 News. Stay safe and keep your eyes open. Kitties! Where are you guys? Kitties! Kitties! What in the name of... Cats are gone. Haven't seen or heard a bird in two days. It's already night out. It's 5:00. Dear Lord in Heaven, help us. Free cable. Oh, it's free ca... Thank God you guys are back. Jesus, Cliff, do we really need all this stuff? What's all this for? We went by the hardware store. You know what happens. Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby from the gas station have locked themselves in over there. They tried to convince other citizens to join them, but with no success. Why? What's happening? Is it some sort of epidemic or what? It's zombies. - What are you saying? - Well, it's the undead. They've been reanimated. Caused by the Earth having been pulled off its axis, caused by the polar fracking. But the authorities and energy people keep saying that's not true. Really? Oh, my God. - She's alive? - No. She's not. She's just undead. Chardonnay. Holy shit. Did she just say "chardonnay"? Yeah, she did. Look out, kids. Hey, little Mallory. Chardonnay. I got this, Cliff. Chardonnay. Those are some pretty good cuts. You played some minor league ball, didn't you? Well, um, a little Class A. It-it was a long time ago. Mindy, just remember to kill the head. Okay. Kill the head. Okay. Ronnie, take this thing out of here. You got it, Chief. Oh, that's very nice. Very nice, indeed. You look gorgeous. You two could have been the king and queen of the golf club, so you could. Oh, my. What's this? Are you in this together? I mean, this is really inappropriate. Oh, good grief. So, the dead just don't want to die today. Is that it? That's a shame. I had them looking so bonny. Oh, what is it now? Who's there? Shit. Who the fuck are you, and what do you want? Ow! Hey! Get the fuck... Shit. I killed him. That was weird. Candy. - Candy. - Snapple. Snapple. Snickers. - Popsicle. - Snickers. Popsicle. Popsicle. Toys. Skittles. Toys. Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi. Bluetooth. Bluetooth. Siri. - Xanax. - Oxy. - Xanax. - Oxy. Ambien. Oxy. Guitar. Guitar. - Tools. - Drill. Sander. Tools. - Hey, no. Come on. - Hey. Hey. Okay, okay. Holy shit. - Hey, we need to mow them down. - Come on, man. Bobby. Shit. I got this one, Hank. Shit. Hey, Bobby! The head, Hank! I killed the head. What the fuck? Is this for real? - Shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh. - Quiet! Get the fuck off me! - Fuck! - Holy shit! Shithead! Save me! - What? No! - What are you doing? Stop! Get the fuck off me! Closet. - Fuck! - Fucking shithead! ...violent... Reports of these bizarre attacks are escalating, with incidents occurring sporadically across the country and, as we're now learning, uh, across the globe. You see, these violent marauders have apparently first been gathering in cemeteries, then dispersing into towns and suburbs, while other reports suggest... Great. Now even the radio's dead. Good riddance. Guys... shouldn't we be telling each other that it's all gonna be okay? That this will all go away, like a bad dream? Ronnie? Gee, Mindy, I'm not sure I can say that. Cliff? Please? It's all gonna be okay, Mindy. Maybe it'll all just go away, like a bad dream. I doubt it. Seven and eight. Now do both for eight. And push. And push. Yeah. Cleveland. What the... Now, that's what I call a murder of crows. Darn, she's really good with that thing, isn't she? She sure is. She's strange. - She's Scottish. - She's Scottish? Let's unbolt the door and get her in here. Thank you very much, Officer Ronald Peterson. Chief Clifford Robertson. Officer Minerva Morrison. What exactly is your plan of action, Chief Clifford Robertson? Well... well... uh, it's a little quieter now. I-I think, I guess we should just get in the patrol car... some of us, anyway... and, uh, patrol the community. After all, that is our job. I'm not staying here. I-I think we should all go together. Well, I guess you're right. I could stay here and monitor things, if that would help. I'm quite confident of my ability to defend myself against the undead. Well, I-I can see that. But, uh, can you operate the police radio and our computer? Oh, aye. No bother. Certainly. Yeah, if it still works. I don't know. That would be a little unusual, wouldn't it, Cliff? Well, this is a highly unusual situation we're in, is it not, Chief Clifford Robertson? Perhaps we could all meet up again in a wee while in the cemetery. Yeah, it's okay. I guess it's okay. Uh, let's go, guys. We've got some more weapons in the patrol car. Excuse me, Officer Ronald Peterson. Might I request that I have the use of your own personal vehicle? Uh, oh. Oh, uh... okay. Oh. Star Wars. Excellent fiction. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah. - Mm. It's the, uh... Red convertible Smart car? Yes. Mind how you go. Slow down a second, Cliff. Excuse me. Yes. Kill the head. They gravitate towards things they did when they were alive. Yeah. Tennis girl's kind of cute. Geez, Cliff. This is way too creepy. Oh, God. I know those kids. But they're all dead. Watch it, Cliff. Did you have to do that? I'm sorry. I didn't see him. Well, it doesn't matter, Mindy. They're already dead. Well, undead, to be precise. Reanimated. Fucking trespasser. Kiss your ass goodbye. Oh, shit, where are they all coming from? It seems pretty quiet. But door number three is open, so I'm gonna check it out. Let's both check it out. Well, I'm coming, too. Oh, that's bad. Sturgill Simpson. Oh, my God. Why did you do that? They're not zombies. They're just dead people. Well, yeah, for now, they're still just dead hipsters, but they haven't turned yet. It can take a while. He's right, Mindy. Now they're just... dead hipsters from Cleveland. Oh, my God. I can't. My God. Well, look at all of you. So very ravenous, yet well past your expiration date. Oh, man. Get a load of these two. Coffee. - Coffee. - Coffee. Oh, God. Not that again. Sturgill Simpson. - ♪ Oh, the dead don't die ♪ - Great song. ♪ Any more than you or I ♪ ♪ They're just ghosts inside a dream ♪ ♪ Of a life that we don't own ♪ ♪ They walk around us all the time... ♪ Goddamn it. I can't take any more. That was irrational, Cliff. Fuck. Do you think Hank and Bobby Wiggins are still in there? Should we try to get 'em out? Uh, Cliff, we're drawing some attention. Oh, God, Cliff. Please get us out of here. Please, Cliff. Please. That should hold. Goddamn zombies, Bobby. I know those guys. They were two of my best customers. Yeah, yeah, the Good brothers. Travis and Dallas Good. They died in a car crash some time back. Oh, shit. Yeah, now I remember those guys. The Good brothers. They were really good guitar pickers. That's right. It's-it's like they came out of the birth canal with guitars in their hands. I think you saved my life, man. No worries, Hank. Shit. - What? - The fucking back door. The back door to the storage room. - What? - Here. Jesus, Bobby. Shit. There's way too many, Hank. This here is a nightmare, Bobby. We're goners, man. Fuck. Come on. Give me that! Well, I'll be a monkey's ass. It's finally payback time. You goddamn refugees! I'll get all of you! You're gonna pay for this! Get off my property! - Hey! Ow! - Mmm. This is good chicken. Damn it! Hey! You want to get out and check? Uh, I'd-I'd rather not. Well, that's perfect, isn't it? Right in the middle of the fucking cemetery. No, it isn't perfect. Why did you run over them? They are not ordinary pedestrians. This is definitely gonna end badly. Shut up, Ronnie. No, you shut up. Shut up, Ronnie! Please stop fighting. Please. Mindy. Mindy... It's my grandmother. Oh, God, Granny. - Mindy, Mindy. - No. Mindy, get it together. It was your grandmother. I can't take this anymore. I can't do it! I'm done with this nightmare. Granny, I'm coming. - I'm coming. - Mindy? No, Mindy! No, don't! Oh, no! Holy fuck. God help us. Centerville. USA. A real nice place. What an amusing little machine. Oh, here's a curious one. Hello there. Fashion. I can assure you that is not your tartan. Nice neck, though. Come on. I know a safe place we can hide. Oh, shit. Is that Danny Perkins? Over here. Sure looks like him. I'm sorry, Ronnie, if I've lost it. It's okay, Cliff. But I got to say, you have been acting a lot different since all this weird shit started happening. What-what are you saying, Cliff? I'm saying that you seem so oddly controlled. I mean, shit. Well, I'm just, you know, dealing with it in my own way. But I've been telling you this is all gonna end badly. Goddamn it, Ronnie. May I ask you a question? Sure. Ask away. You have been saying that this is all gonna end badly, from the very beginning, over and over. So, what made you so fucking sure of that? How did you know everything in advance? Do you really want to know? Yes! I want to know. I really want to know! Okay. I know because I've read the script. You... read the script. The whole script? All of it? Yeah. Jim gave me the whole script. He only gave me our scenes. I never saw a complete script. After all... I've done for that guy. And it's a lot that you don't even know about. What a dick. That's weird. They're all leaving. Right. Here we go. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? I think I am. Was that in the script? No. Not the one I read. Well, that was unexpected. I knew there was something unusual about her. Yeah. So, Ronnie, how does it end, then? Well... We got to give it our best shot. "Our best shot." Okay. Yeah. But then it ends badly, right? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it does. Okay, then. Let's do it. Let's do it. Cliff and little Ronnie. Warriors. Among the dead. Zombies. Remnants of the materialist people. Oh, no, you don't. No, you don't. I guess they've been zombies all along. Ghosts. Oh, hey, Bobby. Shit. "Nameless miseries of the numberless mortals." Frank. Hey. You got this coming. Goodbye, Frank. You reap what you sow. All right, who's next? Ow. Yuck. All righty. Hold your head up. Granny. Mindy would want you to say hi to Grandpa. Ah, Hank. I'm so sorry, brother. I just can't do it. You take care of yourself. Danny. I just saw Hank. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Ronnie. Mindy! Cliff. Ronnie. No! Jesus, Ronnie. The dead just don't want to die today. Reanimated and all jacked up, just like those ants. The end of the world. I guess all them ghost people plumb lost their goddamn souls. Must have traded 'em away or sold 'em for gold or whatnot. New trucks, kitchen appliances, new trousers, Nintendo Game Boys, shit like that. Just hungry for more stuff. Oh, down they go. The sad end of Cliff and Ronnie.
