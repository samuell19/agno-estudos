It's a pig, you always you can rely on her. Guys guys! This is your new buddy go get acquainted! He's a different color. Dark as a mountain. I do not like him. Also silent. - Maybe give him a pendel? - Great idea. How will the pendel receive, will probably speak. Listen to me scumbags if any of you come close to me ... ... so I will clean his face ... ... my own mother won't know. Why are you trudging about? Hey kid, what are you doing here? Why did you take it? - None of your dog business. Do we understand each other? - Hush! We made them yesterday. Looks like rubber but inside is tin. Like a real militia. - And she hits painfully. - A lousy thing. Okay, that's enough! Re going! We go to the West. To the Jewish school. Let's finish off the scum. - Tadek, leave him! - Oh, you murderers! The Jews are lousy! Get out of our area! Don't lose your courage. To get nowhere from here did not leave. “You’ll have to fight too. - And if the big man turns out to be? - You know what to do. Andrzej! Come on! You and the little one, come out. Faster! Hands! Come on. Stand. Hands. They sat down. Mom is here. Why is she dressed so strangely? This is not her dress. That's good. Mom goes. Senior - Andrzej ... ... it was then seven years old, and Tadek - four and a half. At such a young age they had to part with their father. Also in this way. He died in my arms. Well well. Andrzej, come here. - She told him that dad was dead. - Leave me alone. What ... really told him so? This photo always with me. Is he awarded the Virtut Military? He was the commander partisan detachment. He received all possible rewards. In the beginning, everyone wanted to help. You know how it is. You must understand that this is a serious matter. These are not ordinary hooligans. This is a real gang. It is headed by Stashek Baluga. Baluga's gang? I did not know that. I will let them go. Thank. Mom ... - Mom ... - Dont touch me! Dirty. Go beat the Jews? If I only find out ... Home! This very minute! Home! Alive! We got caught because of you. Told you to wait for us, you idiot. Quiet, mom is coming. Pretend to be asleep. Nothing will help you. The dream is over. Need to talk. You are about many things have no idea. You don't know anything at all. You are forbidden to come near to Baluga. Clear? Get out of bed I can't talk like that. Get out! You're out of your mind? To bed with boots? Tadek, get out of bed. Take off your clothes. You wanted to talk to us. Will you still tell me when and how should I talk! Everything is dirty. Why don't you wash? What is it? Come here. Good God! Take off your shirt. Turn around. - Is that so in your department? - I beat one in civilian ... ... three more added to us ... ... but the one in civilian - just a beast. Looks like Judas. Your happiness, that I pulled you out. And it was funny what did you say to him there. - Did you like it? - Yeah. Get dressed. You too. What is it? What did you say about the belt? Well get out of it! Sorry, I didn't notice. - Besides, you ruined me ... - Shut up before you got it! My hands are itching punch you. You are a complete idiot! What the fuck did I do? Why did you get to the bottom of me? What did you do? You fucked up everything. You won't go anywhere else with me cretin. They gave you twenty I have seen. Me too. But a trifle. Do you want to change? Do you think you stumbled upon a fool? Do you think I want to cheat? If you don't want to, well, okay. No, no, it's okay. But let's do it my way. - What's the matter? - Either you get up, or there will be no exchange. Okay. Now we take five steps forward. Now we turn around. And we put the money on the sidewalk. I count to three. And we take the money. Clear? - I see. - One two Three! You asshole! Well, wait, I’ll find it - I’ll kick out my legs. I told you do not come here? - Have you passed it? - Yes, and this is for you. What? Not needed? Why are you without lump? I don't need it anymore. - Why? - Yours also remains. Minor, let's hurry. It looks like we are leaving here. Where? To Australia. We? You are persecuting! To Australia? - True? - Don't shout like that. It's a secret. I don’t believe! Is it true to Australia? Listen, do you remember Uncle Fritz? I remember. Has something happened to him? No, just ... ... you see, well ... ... like ... well, he's a Jew. Like this? How did this happen to him? No way, he always was. True? E-mine he was so cute. Our aunt ... who sent a gift from Australia ... - She too... - A Jewess? - Don't shout like that! Why are you so amused, damn it? Give it back! Let's talk! Well, and the fraery! Ay, not hunting. I have something for you. - Here you go. - Thank! See how they beat! How they fight! And where did the Jews come from ... ...in our family? Mom too. Also? Are not you lying? Our mother? - And the father? - No, father - no. You can see for yourself - neither are we. Not in this case: Yes or no. - Think what people will say when they find out that our mother ... - But what can we do? As soon as we show up in the yard ... dude, Baluga will sew us on. That's it. Brick face and not a word to anyone. We leave in three months. Therefore, behave as if nothing had happened. Very beautiful. You have talent, boy. Tasty. - And what's that? - Olives, I guess. Behave yourself. Stop. Let's go to. My name is Tadek. And you? I am ... Australia. How do you say ... the natives ... Do you know who kangaroos are? Not a ram, you fool, and the kangaroo. Finally got it! Australia is great! Don't stare like that. Fine. Please don't go naked. This is not appropriate. This will be a festive dinner. Behave as well well-bred boys. I'm completely serious. - Did you tell him? - You tell me. Andrzej, what is this nonsense over my head? You are hiding something from me. Tadek, plans have changed a bit. - To be honest, we are not sailing to Australia. - And where to? Look how wonderful it is. Aunt Elya, who sent us packages, there too. So after all the parcels were from Australia! We only said that that they are from there. It's just the same there like in Australia. Well, where are we are we sailing? Big sea, beautiful beaches ... The sun. Once upon a time this country called Palestine. And now this is Israel. But it makes absolutely no difference to you because it’s just like Australia. What are you doing? You are crazy? Lies, all lies. Constantly lying to me! I'm not going to any Palestine! I do not believe you! You are not Jewish! I have nothing to do with this crap! Understand, finally, child! I'm Jewish! And I'm sitting in this crap. And you too! Your Jesus was also a Jew. And never accuse me of lying, okay? To be on time for lunch! You asshole! - Tadek! - She hates me. This is your beloved son ... ... which never did not spill the beans. - And I ... if I die, she will even be delighted. - Well, what are you talking about? And there is no need to call me a fool. Why did she lie all the time? And why is she everything to you told? You bombard her with questions it makes her nervous. Not only did we find ourselves some Jews ... ... we are also sailing to their country. Parcels were also Jewish ... ... and Jesus was a Jew? All this lies and you also mock and lie. “But Jesus was a Jew. - Stop talking nonsense. Was Jesus a Jew? The Jews killed Him. Are you saying they killed their own? You do not understand anything, you are small and stupid. Stop being smart. Nafig I need all this. I'm getting off the ship. - I'm not going with you. - And who cares about it, whether you like it or not. The ship is heading that way. You will not reach the shore. Well, aren't you coming? What are they? I will decide your problems. Everything will be good. It's very good here. You're cheating. Enough. Andrzej, straighten the bedspread see how it looks. - And still it will be necessary ... - Mom ... I asked you ... This is an agency representative. Take everything away, straighten the bedspread. And tell him to wait I'll be right there. - Do you remember how exactly his name is? - Pan Yechezkel. - How? - Pan Ye-hez-kel. - Good day. - Mom will come now. Thank. How are you? Is the school good? - School? - School. - School, yes, thanks, good. Sorry, I do not understand. This is me in Polish. Pan Yehezkel, I am very pleased. That's for me? Thank. Let's go home. - Why? We just came. - Don't you see? My gum broke. Put on mine, and I'll put on yours, and there will be nishtyak. - I can I'll tie it up somehow. - As you want. Here you go. I found the wire! Come here. Does not work, too thick. Forget it, it's still not visible. Keep your protection. Don't jump like that. Imagine that you are Cassius Clay. - Oh, well done. - I'm a kangaroo. Let's do it one more time. - Do you know what bothers me all the time? - Wire? Yes, including. Something that I can’t accept. The Jews are lousy! The muzzles of the Jews! - Lousy dogs! - Scum! This is so strange. They should be ashamed that they are Jews. And some are proud of it. They don't like non-Jews. See that no one knows about what happened in Poland. - Break. - Good. - And don't show your bolt to anyone. - Why? - Because they have a little different. - What does the other mean? Well ... let's go ... We have it like a church tower. And they have it like a mosque tower. We have better. They look like a boob. You are a pig! It's not funny at all! Mom seems to have come. Good day. Pan Yechezkel said ... ...what do you have work for me. Okay, just a little faster. I look like? Well? - Your mascara is smeared. - Wipe it up. You are crazy? Not saliva! - Let's go to. - What? Let's go from here. You won't work here. Are you crazy? Let's go. Are you Janek? Janek Meyerovich? Well, the mug. Naturally devil. He is the demon. How do you know him? In the ghetto. Have you ... been to the ghetto? Tadek! Wait! Give me a break. Let's go sit there. - Well, the heat, eh? - Horror. - Do you want to eat? - And how. So do I. You will have to move to a kibbutz. As soon as I find a job take you out of there. What is a kibbutz? This is a wonderful place for kids. Everyone is given on a bike. - And you don't have to pay for it at all? - Not. In the kibbutz in general do not use money. And they have everything. We only have £ 10 left. This is enough for a modest existence until the end of the week. Or... ... you can go in the evening in a restaurant... -... and spend everything on a sumptuous dinner. - Dinner! Let's go! Do you have cigarettes? - Sure. I hid it on the bus. - Okay, let's get out of here. - Where are the suitcases? - Here, under the bushes. Okay, let's get out of here otherwise they will make you pay. It seems you don't have to pay. Everything is free here. I'm not going to stay here anymore. We return to Poland. Give me matches. Wait, maybe it will be okay here. We'll see. This place is strange. I don’t want to stay here. You know ... when they told me that I was a Jew, it's like I have syphilis or tuberculosis. I couldn't look in the mirror. I would have such a face also could not. We cannot go back now. Surely everyone knows ... ... that we are Jews. Let's run away to Australia. Nobody knows us there. Stop fantasizing. This is Leva, he will take care of Andrzej. And this is Lucy, she will take care of Tadek. Lucy from Russia, but knows Polish. Very nice. I haven't seen such young gentlemen. Where are your suitcases? This will be your room. You will live with Oded and two girls - Daria and Roni. Here is your bed. This will be your locker. Tadek. We will immediately remove your things in the closet. You will receive new ones tomorrow. You have a sharp knife more accurate. Dirty laundry and clothes throw it here. When they are washed they will be back in the closet. Where is the iron? - Can you iron? - What's so difficult about that? Sit side by side. It's very good that you can iron. Children don't iron here because it is not safe. Now go swimming. I myself! I'm sure, that you can handle it yourself ... ... but I love doing it. Let me, okay? Good. Your feet are cold. They smell slightly. Slightly. Get your hands dirty. Do not worry. I'll wash it with soap and they will be clean again. I myself! You have nothing to be ashamed of. Here all the children wash together - both boys and girls. Nobody is shy. - Girls too? - Yes. - And they are allowed? - Sure. Because here, like a family. Everybody knows each other. I would even be with my sisters did not wash. This is ridiculous. First you can ask a separate booth. And then you get used to it. Wash. Zvi, your guests. Zvi, this is Tadek. Tadek, this is my husband Zvi, he understands Polish. Nice to meet you. I was very happy to meet you. Zvi was born in Poland and understands your every word, but he doesn't speak Polish. You already forgot how to speak polish? I know a little Hebrew. Zvi decided that he would no longer speak Polish. - But why? - Zvi will explain it to you next time, okay? Now let's go. You can say goodbye but don't call me "you", okay? Kick, it's not for you! What is a kick-ass? Kick-ass is a bad word. Pass him, pass him! - Why didn't you give him a pass? - Who? Him, him. You have to say: "pass me" and do not "pass him". - So "me", and so - "him". - Fir-trees, sticks, pass me. Did someone wake up in Livna's group? Calm down, it's me. What are you with a knife? Yes, I always carry it in my pocket, nobody knows about it. Hide, otherwise there will be problems because of him. You know it's not easy for me to get out of the house. We are thoroughly herded. In the corridor there are such special devices ... ... who hear even if you roll over in bed on the other side. In came up with. Let's go to. - Where? - You will see. - Look. - What? Is this all ice cream? Just think where else can you find this? Spoons needed! - How is it there? Are you managing? - And how! You know, here, like in paradise. Nobody locks the doors with a key. I don't want to do this. Everyone will understand that we are. But in general, they are good people. Good people? Do you know how much they hate Poles? I know they don't talk about them well. I'm afraid they will find out that we are not Jews. Then there will definitely be an end. If anyone calls you a goa give him in the face and harder. What is goy? Worse than this word not here. Who are all these people? These are photos from Poland. Relatives. And this is for sure Zvi. There is no Zvi in ​​this picture. This is his older brother. The Poles killed him after the war. The same does not happen! Poles don't do that. Can not be. When you grow up you yourself will find out the truth. Zvi cooked surprise you. - Can I take a ride? - This is your bike. Do what you want with him. Look ahead all the time if you put your head down, you’ll come back. Well done, Tadek, Do not stop. Why does he run all the time? This is Pico. Wants to be taken to the special forces. He's cool just a little weird. - Strange? - Too educated, does not want to wash with anyone. And it seems to me cool. He came to us from afar, and there are other customs. A little time will pass and he will become just like you. My father calls everyone Poles with "cholera". ...Twice a year in the sky. In spring and autumn. Who can tell the reason flight of birds? They fly on foreign tours. You keep forgetting that we don't need to raise our hand. They fly away because they are hungry because they are cold and snow is falling. Do not laugh, this is the correct answer. This time lucky you. - Who are you writing to? - Mom. See it's cool Tadek knows foreign letters. Eka is unseen. He writes in Hebrew with errors. - Where did you find it? - I didn’t dig it, I took it from my roommate. Allowed to take. I'll give it to him. You're not ashamed anymore, are you? No, why? Ay, it doesn't matter thinking out loud. Learned to write in Hebrew? Little. Then look, I'll show you something. But if you laugh, you get it. Keep in mind, I know the language poorly. Okay. Take a closer look and say whose legs are prettier? This one. - Puppy, you don't understand anything. - Which one? - This one. - This one? - Not! This one in the back. Why this one? Her face is not visible, only legs. Idiot, I'm talking about your face or asked feet? There is no other photo. You will get it now! She's from another kibbutz. You have to help me write a letter. - Here you go. - No thanks, I quit. What? Don't you smoke? I've already made up everything, and now flew out of my head. - Think of something. - What? Write, come on! I suggest to start something like this. "I watched with delight your idea. Couldn't take my eyes off from your feet. Now I can neither sleep nor eat ... ... until I return and I won't see any of them. " In a joke! Guard! You are a diligent student. And already in a month or two you will be fluent in Hebrew. - Lucy? - Yes? How do you spell: "Am I in awe of your legs?" Anything else you want to ask? I don't think that's enough. - Thank. - You are welcome. Andrzej! On, wrote. You wrote, what will I wait by the tree? Wrote but did not write, what day. Nothing wrong, I will wait every day. - Come on, I'll show you something. - Now I can't, they are waiting for me. If you don't come with me now, I won't tell you anything else. But I really can't right now! Do you know, why can't you touch it? I just looked. Tadek, great! So good corridor no one has washed yet. May somehow go to the bathhouse with everyone? The boys stopped bathing with the girls to make you comfortable. Seems to me that you are exaggerating the problem. Hang towels on the street let them dry! - Give me. - You look disgusting. And with a hat, and without - terrible. Who's talking there? - This is Ami, I'm already going to bed. “Good night, Ami, go to bed. “Ask Tadek to show us his. - I do not want. Tadek, don't be shy. Show us yours. We can measure it for you. We measure everything. Ilan has the biggest - 11 centimeters. Why did you tell him? This is our secret. - He's with us now. - No, not yet. Let's all undress. Let's get undressed. Will not work. Have you seen with us now show yours. But I didn't say that he agreed. - Let's undress him by force. - He did not say that he agreed. - If you don't want to, don't. You are all on his side. Leave him alone. What's with you today? I'll come and put things in order now. - Tadek! - Tadek! - Isn't that your brother? “I didn't notice him. Andrzej, what are you doing? Why didn't you stop? - You saw me. - Where was it? Didn't see you By God, I haven't. “You promised to visit me. - Did you receive a letter from your mother? Did she write when she arrives? - Come with me. - You see... Tadek, bring grain. - Then, let's go. - Wait, I can't leave him. Okay, I'm only birds I'll help you feed and let's go. Hey, you! Close the door! Tadek, tell him to close, otherwise the pigeons will fly away. Move! Andrzej, stop it! Crazy! Idiot! A piece of cattle! What are you mad about? I light it up. And it was necessary to do so? I don't understand are you for him or for me? Why cover the birds? Holy Mother, help me! I'm afraid the truth will be revealed and then the end. Therefore, I appeal to you. Dear Jesus, you alone you can understand me. You were Jewish too and a Christian. I can't talk about it with my brother ... ... he constantly sins and does not even think to stop. I can stop sinning and become like them. Who's running there? It's me, Tadek. I went to the toilet. Tadek, go to bed. Good night. Leave me alone, let me sleep. You will do it again I'll break your watch. You won't touch them, okay? I will kill for this! Who's talking there? I'm coming to you. - Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal. Tadek, you don't know where is Andrzej? In the room, I guess. When I take him to me, he comes for five minutes, and then disappears without a word. - I do not know what to do. - He likes to be alone. Sorry. Enjoy your meal. I'll go look for him. Andrzej! Andrzej! How much is there in total! How much he stole. What are you digging for here? - I've been looking for you. - Yeah, under the mattress? Do not speed. Give it all. Yet. Come on, come on. - Come on. - Where did you get this? Don't play the fool. Here you are. Did you steal from my class? If you don't know, be quiet. He didn't steal it, but Levan gave it to me. Levan gave you ... Look what is written here. - This is Ilana. - If you rummage in my room again, you will get it on your forehead. You know? I do not want, for you to come to my class. If I see you there I'll tell you everything. Who would have thought what such an angel used to do. Have you forgotten what we did together? Didn't steal with me, did you? It was once. Now it's different. So that I don't see you there again. Differently? What does it mean "differently"? Stop talking nonsense. Do you know? I don’t want to see you again. You will regret it yet. How sorry you are. Goy! Come here! I count to three. Time. Two. If you touch them with your finger, I will finish you. Come here! Three! Leave him alone stinking goy! I'm going to kill him! Fool, leave him alone! Hold on, come on! Don't be so constrained. I would smoke relaxed. Why are they there sit for so long? The way you did Oded it is not normal. But when your mother told us ... ... what have you been through, I understood a lot. What are you to them did you even tell? Never mind. The main thing is that they took you back. And if you beat someone up again, my stories won't help. - What happened with you? - He called me in front of everyone "goy". They didn't tell me about it. Said you broke shattered expensive watches. Next Don't break anything. If you can't break something, break what is cheaper. Okay. In general, what do you need me for? Have you had a fight? Not. It's great here. Feeding is normal, Zvi gave me a bicycle. Lucy is really a very decent woman. It's good that you are with her. And your guardian is constantly offended. Because he he's still a bore. - But you get along with him? - Yes. Mom, I wrote you a letter but did not send. Don't read it now! Read it at home. "Are you really suffering like that?" - To be like everyone else. All you need is your signature that you agree. Mama said you yourself asked for circumcision. This is a very wise decision. from your side. - Where is your brother? - In the kibbutz. Ask your mom if she spoke with your brother. I understood. He does not want. Doesn't want to, don't. He will be sorry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Boy, what's your name? - Tadek. Strange name. - Shauli, my son, asked me to treat you with chocolate. - No thanks. Take it, take it I am treating you. - What will you be operated on? - Belly. - What about the belly? - I'm not really in the know. - Where am I being taken? - To the operating room. - Wait a minute, I haven't fallen asleep yet! - It's okay. But I haven't fallen asleep yet! I am not sleeping, not sleeping, I am still ... Wait, leave! I still do not sleep. You can't drink yet. If you feel thirsty call me. You can't get up. If you want a pipi, here's a duck. Got it? Sister! Asleep, it seems. So even better, because he is very shy. I brought him a present. - Give it to him when he wakes up. - Would you like some tea? - Yes thank you. - Galinka, there is one problem. - Uh-huh? Andrzej disappeared from the kibbutz and no one knows where he went. How did it disappear? Someone from the kibbutz saw him on the road to the city with a suitcase in hand. Only that was two days ago. They called me and asked suddenly he returned home. Tadek ... did we wake you up? I know where Andrzej is. He returned to Poland. - What nonsense are you talking about? - He's been planning for a long time. - But how? “I don’t know, he didn’t speak. I'm going to the police. - What else did he tell you? - Not. Okay, I'm going to the police. We need to dress soon. You go yourself, nothing, you can handle it. Mom, I'm ashamed. What will I say there? - What did you come to change the bandage on the pipette? - Come on, don't say that. You go to the nurse and say in your ear her what to do. You can do it. Well nafig. Well nafig, nothing happens. I wanted ... I wanted so that you have a normal family. Well, all nafig. Nafig! Do not look at me so! I know that it's my fault! Mom, I love you. Okay. Let's go play solitaire. Anything is better than crying. You need to make a wish ... ... and if the solitaire goes well, it will come true. Come on then. - Mom ... - What? - I will not return to the kibbutz. Are you sure? Good. Jesus Maria! Is your son? Andrzej, where have you been? What has he done? Let him tell you himself. Keep an eye on him. Goodbye. Show off your new member. Show me. He's all in bandages. Never in my life I will not do it. - Tell me how it was there? - Where? And it's good that I was caught. Because it turned out to be a flight to China. Tadek, I forgot. - Aunt brought you a present. - How cool. - Is this real gold? - Yes, the present. This is a miniature Torah. - It is kept in a special place in the synagogue. - Andrzej, look. Handsomely. Don't you think that everything is for you get away with it. - Go to bed. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. My poor! What have they done to you? Now you have become some kind of moronic. I like you. I love you. It won't be easy. But we can handle it, huh? Translation: Professor
