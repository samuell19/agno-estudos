Boss, here's today's sales report... Robbers! Everyone down! No! Let me go! Want a blast? Step right up! I'm giving them away as presents! Shit! What's this? Nothing but ten-dollar bills?! What the hell were you thinking?! Cops! Hey, do something! Didn't you hear me...? Hey, will we be OK? There's more coming! We'll take the prearranged route. Unit 52, currently in pursuit of suspect vehicle. Approaching Dearborn, over. Copy. Maintain pursuit. I'll lose them! What the hell's this? Well, this is annoying... Cut the bullshit! Move it! Break through that fence! You should be able to get through to the other side! Don't worry about hitting him! We'll sandwich him with that trailer! What were you looking at, you jerk?! What were you looking at, you jerk?! : They're all trashed! Sheeit! Get that thing out of the way! They're all trashed! Sheeit! Get that thing out of the way! Get that thing out of the way! We gotta go after them! We gotta go after them! I just knew it'd be the Roadbuster! We gotta go after them! Fuck! Exactly 45 grand. Hold on a sec! Got a problem? With what we made this time, that's not fair! Not getting enough is your problem, not mine. I did my part. I'm taking what we agreed on. Hey! The next job- No thanks! You're such amateurs that it's doubtful you'll cover my fee. Besides, I don't work for assholes who use kids as accomplices! C'mon, get in! Let's go. Let's go. OK! Bean? You in there? I'm coming in! Wake up, Bean! It's already 10:30! Bean! Well? Are you awake now? Rally, your wake-up technique leaves a lot to be desired! Were you planning to fry my eyeball? You didn't wake up when I used the stun gun! So anyway, how'd it go last night? Did you get the money okay? Uh-huh. But I'm done with that trigger-happy moron and his pint-sized partner. So what's our schedule for the rest of the week? Never mind the week; there's nothing on for the month. Huh? I tell you, even our $40,000 minimum fee is too expensive. Unless we lower our prices and get more jobs, we'll go broke. Our prices aren't the problem. The problem is that we can't advertise. Is the wiretap on the police lines still in place? Yeah, but there's nothing interesting on it. Could that be... a customer? I wish... I wish... Who's there? Who's there? I have a delivery job. Please let me in! Who's there? I have a delivery job. Please let me in! I have a delivery job. Please let me in! This ain't UPS, fella! This is a request for the Roadbuster! Please let me in! I'm not the police! Hang on a sec. Please help us! We've just escaped from a gang of kidnappers! Inspector! Inspector! Eh...? Eh...? The Chief's asking for you. Eh...? The Chief's asking for you. The Chief's asking for you. Oh, all right. Oh, all right. Hmm, that's a nice car. ls it a Mustang? Oh, all right. No, a Cobra! A Shelby Cobra GT 500! With this, I'll run that damn Roadbuster right off the road! With the Shelby engine souped up to 355 hp, it's a real monster! Maximum torque, 58 kilos! She's got Goodyear Eagle tires and Bilstein shocks! That Roadbuster's finally going to be busted! That slimeball's trashed 74 police cars! This time he'll pay! Is the Chief up on the fourth floor? Is the Chief up on the fourth floor? Y...Yes, sir. What can I do for you, Chief? Percy! How about opening doors quietly for a change? You made me come up here just to tell me that? No, you idiot, for work! That Roadbuster case you're always working on... Leave it to me! I've finally got a car that can take his out. You can forget about it for now. Two days ago, the daughter of the Chairman of the Grimwood Group was kidnapped. Get on the case! You've gotta be kidding! Why do I have to work a shitty kidnapping case? What do you mean, “shitty”? Do you know how much Grimwood pays in taxes? If the kid ends up dead, the mayor will have our heads. And then you won't be able to pursue your favorite case. What have we got? Chelsea Grimwood, age 11. Last seen the evening of the 14th. So, uh... So, uh... Maurice. Maurice. OK, Maurice... Maurice. ...why didn't you just go straight home, or run to the cops? They seem to be a big operation and may have the police in their pockets. I couldn't possibly get Miss Grimwood to the mansion. It was a miracle that we made it here. Please! Take us to the mansion in your car. You'll be paid a more than adequate fee. How'd you know about this office? The Grimwood Group has an intelligence agency. They have a dossier on you. Bean! It's true. They were talking about it on the police line. This was intercepted ten minutes ago. She's probably been spirited away into the kiddie-porn underground. She's Grimwood's daughter, and 11 years old to boot! The perverts will be drooling over her! Don't get so upset. Why don't you go to the briefings or something? You know I don't like conducting investigations like that! You'd only have to show up! My man Percy! For 50 grand, you've got a deal. You'll take the job? You'll take the job? Cash in full, on arrival. Cash in full, on arrival. Of course! Cash in full, on arrival. Is he dead? Is he dead? With his brains splattered, he's either dead or a zombie. What about the girl? What about the girl? Over there. I kicked the chair over before the glass blew out. She didn't catch a single shot! She didn't catch a single shot! She's still asleep! She's still asleep! They must have used a strong drug. She's still asleep! Bean, are you all right? Bean, are you all right? Aw, I'm touched by your concern! There! Perfect condition! Rally! Where's the tape? I am Maurice Grey, a Grimwood family bodyguard. As you are a first-class courier, I'd like to ask- It'll be difficult to get them to trust us with just this tape. I wonder if they'll pay up? Well, 50 grand might be a bit steep, so it'll depend on how they take it. If they think we kidnapped her or we screw up somehow... ...we'll just drop off the kid and split. You're being awfully softhearted about this. What's wrong? Child abductions just rub me the wrong way, you know. Hey, you don't suppose those gunmen were part of the kidnapping group? But they just started shooting, without trying to get their hostages back... Strange, isn't it? ls anyone else mad at you? Loads of people. Bean! What're we going to do about our client? I'll call the Cleaner later. What? You're shitting me! Well, the manager of the Ontario warehouse gave us the tip. Is it really him? Is it really him? Apparently a security camera picked it up... Here! Here! The Roadbuster! Yes, but you'll never guess who was in the back seat! Look what the computer enhancement shows! H...Hey, that's...! Yes, Chelsea Grimwood. No doubt about it. Outfit's the same, too. It's a sure bet the Roadbuster is involved in the kidnapping. Indeed! Indeed! We can go after him with impunity! Good work! Just you wait, Roadbuster! I'll finish you off for sure. I'll run you over until your brains squish out! How are you feeling, Mr. Grimwood? Not good. Terrible. You want mustard? You want mustard? Yes, plenty. May I ask you something...? What? What? My daughter, Chelsea... you'll return her safely, right? I'd guess that she's either at home or with the police by now. I see... Would you let me watch TV or listen to the radio? No way! Semmer will get mad at me. Exactly what is she to you? She's my lover! She's my lover! H...How old are you, anyway? It's not polite to ask a lady her age! Anyway, hurry up and eat. We're leaving right after Semmer gets back. Uh, just a moment... Uh... no, never mind. Uh, just a sec... Uh, just a sec... What is it?! No, this is for real. I need to go to the bathroom. Semmer's got the key to your leg cuffs. Well, I can wait on No2, but I can't hold off on No1 much longer. No problem. There's a piss bottle under the table. Uh... Would you step outside for a moment? Won't you have a hard time with those cuffs on? Shall I give you a hand? No, that's all right. No! We can't have you making a mess on the carpet. Let me help you. No, no, I still haven't had a shower today. I'm filthy. Then I'll clean it up! H-Hey! H-Hey! It's OK. I'm quite skilled. Semmer always praises me. Stop! Uh, sorry... What'd you do that for? I was just being nice! How'd you like me to slice it off? That's not something kids do. Don't you preach to me! I'm wise to your “nice old man” bullshit! You misunderstood me. You misunderstood me. Nobody gets rich by being a nice guy! Did she tell you that? Yes! She says that all the time! And you believe what that bitch tells... And you believe what that bitch tells... “That bitch,” you called me...? In my social circle, I'm considered to be quite the lady! Semmer! Welcome back! “Hello, Carrie”... is what I want to say, but... I wonder if you're not being overly hospitable to our hostage. Oops... you saw that... Don't you dare... try to put one over on me... you little tramp! Stop it! I'm... I'm sorry... Mistress... Maybe I haven't been hard enough on you. I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore, so please... If you do anything like this again... Stop it! I'll obey your every command, Mistress... Please forgive me... All right, we're leaving. Get your stuff together. OK! You rotten bitch... You rotten bitch... Now, now... That's not nice. Hostages should mind what they say. My daughter...? My daughter...? I left her with a pro. With any luck, she should already be home. A Pro? A pro? Bean Bandit. Maybe you know of him? The Roadbuster. I've heard a lot about him. Well, if he puts on his trademark show, it'll make it much easier for us to get away. What do you mean by...? What do you mean by...? I suggest that you shut up. For the time being, you are a well-paying guest... ...so I'd hate to have to get rough. And now, it's time to go. Come with me. Who the hell are you? Never mind who we are! ls this the Grimwood place? Let's see some ID! A guy who used to be a guard here asked me to come. Get me the Chairman. I can't put anyone through without proof of identity! You got an appointment? Main gate! Go on through! Heh... Thank you! My, my, all these nice men coming to greet us. I wonder what they do when they're not so busy? Drink, smoke, watch TV, and gamble... Just like gangsters. Uh, testing, testing... Dear gentlemen of the Grimwood Group! Thank you for such a magnificent reception! I'm a courier. I can't tell you my name for a variety of reasons... ...but I've brought Miss Chelsea here at the request of your colleague, Maurice. They escaped from a gang of kidnappers. Open the door! Let Miss Chelsea out now! Unlock the door and put your hands on your head! I'm going to play a testimonial tape now. I am Maurice Grey, a Grimwood family- Inspector! The Roadbuster's at the Grimwood Estate! Hey! Who's covering the Grimwood place now? Akira and Terry, sir. Akira and Terry, sir. Ha! Those bozos! But why would he show up there? Word is he brought the Chelsea girl with him! What?! What?! Eyes on the road, please! Eyes on the road, please! What's he up to? Eyes on the road, please! What's he up to? What's he up to? I don't know! Don't tell me the ransom's already been paid... Come on! Move it! Cash in full, on arrival. Cash in full, on arrival. Of course! And that's it. Fifty grand, just like the man said. Is that all you've got to say? There are no guards here named Maurice. Where's the Chairman and the cash? Where's the Chairman and the cash? I don't follow you. Mr. George Grimwood, the Chairman! He took $2 million to make the trade with you bastards this morning! Er... Well... Enough! We can talk later! Right now, get out of that junkheap! What the hell... What did you just say? I said, get out of that piece of crap car, now! What a shitbox. Bean! Bean! Move your ass! What are you putting on your seat belt for? Get out, punk! Move it! Don't fuck with me! Bulletproof! Fucking shitbox... Piece of crap? Shitbox? Fuck you, man! Uh-oh! Hi! You awake, Miss? Hi! You awake, Miss? Oh no! Oh no! Let me go! Hey, let me go! Oh no! Let me go! Hey, let me go! Miss, calm down...! Bean! Oh no! Let me go! Hey, let me go! Oh no! Let me go! Hey, let me go! We forget the 50 grand, drop her off, and split. We forget the 50 grand, drop her off, and split. Save me, Papa! We forget the 50 grand, drop her off, and split. OK, let her out! An anti-tank rifle! Get us out of here! Police! Open that gate! Move it! You jerks listen up! Block this gate no matter what! Yo, Percy my man! How's life? Road...b-buster... Nice car you got there. GT500? Yeah. I finally found just the right car to waste you in. You mean, just right to be wasted by me in, right? Ha! I can't believe that a dirtbag who's stooped to kidnapping children... ...still has the nerve to brag! Who's kidnapping children? Shut up! I've got proof. Hey! Dick! Uh, yes, sir? Uh, yes, sir? Show him. You'll get at least ten years for this! I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah? Who's the brat in the back seat? If I let her out, they'll shoot me up with a 20mm cannon... Say What?! See? I haven't even let her out yet and they're shooting. See ya! After them! After them! Oh no, broken glass...! Oh no, broken glass...! You morons! Oh no, broken glass...! Shouldn't we take off from O'Hare? After all, it's the closest. Don't be an idiot! It's also the first place that bastard will check... ...once our little deception is exposed. ...once our little deception is exposed. That bastard...? That bastard...? Right! That bastard...? He's a professional getaway driver who's wrecked dozens of police cars. The cops aren't likely to catch him. So he'll be drawing the police's attention away from us, right? You got it. Hey, wait, wait a second! What do you think you're doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm going to get gas. Get gas? There's not much time left before the plane leaves! I'll get it all done in 15 minutes! I want to stock up on munchies, too. Now hold on a moment! We'll make it, right? Sure, with a full tank. Welcome. May I take your...? Welcome. May I take your...? Because, if we hadn't done it... ...we'd all have been in danger! They thought we were the kidnappers! They started shooting at us before we had a chance to drop you off. And on top of that, they opened up on us with a 20mm cannon! Naturally, I want to get you home safely... Naturally, I want to get you home safely... Oh, don't mind them. ...but it's not possible right now, so... I'll have 30 spareribs and a case of Bud. I'll have 30 spareribs and a case of Bud. ...please, until this is settled, help us out. I'll have 30 spareribs and a case of Bud. ...please, until this is settled, help us out. ...please, until this is settled, help us out. What about you two? What about you two? Oh, I'll have a sand- What about you two? Oh, I'll have a sand- Oh, I'll have a sand- Strawberry pudding and milk! So you finally talked. It's good that your stomach is honest. Add a sandwich, a strawberry pudding, and a milk, OK? Thanks! Coming right up! Now let's see... Get a load of this! This explains the cops coming down on me like a ton of bricks. You're sure this isn't you, sweetie? Uh-uh, that's not me. But she'd already been kidnapped by then and was wearing the same clothes. That bastard from last night was either one of the kidnappers or Mr. Big himself. Hello! Yeah, it's me... Oh...? Uh-huh... I see... All right... Thanks. Sweetie? You said you don't know any guards named Maurice, right? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So he was in on it? So he was in on it? Yeah. That was the Cleaner. He said... So he was in on it? So he was in on it? ...there wasn't a body at the office. So he was in on it? ...there wasn't a body at the office. ...there wasn't a body at the office. Which means... Which means... He played dead and split! Which means... Hey! The guards said there was a $2 million payoff this morning. They dumped her on us as a decoy to cover their getaway. With $2 million! With $2 million! Yep, with $2 million! Yep, with $2 million! Two million dollars?! Yep, with $2 million! Two million dollars?! Two million dollars?! That's right! That's right! How do we find them? That's right! How do we find them? How do we find them? Good question... I'm hungry. ls the pudding here yet? I'm telling you, Bean, it's your fault for getting caught by that camera! I had no choice! The road was blocked! It was the only way I could get through! Why didn't you drive over it? Why didn't you drive over it? There was a big rig blocking the road! There was a big rig blocking the road! What's that? There was a big rig blocking the road! A big trailer, an eighteen-wheeler. It was blocking the whole damn road! Hey, maybe it was one of the kidnappers... Makes sense, now that I think about it. What kind of truck was it? What kind of truck was it? Eh...? There! Just like that one! It was the same color, and the long side was facing us... ...and the cop cars smashed into it... Huh? That's the truck! Rally! Shoot! That's the truck! Rally! Shoot! What? What? That's the truck! The one from last night! What? That's the truck! The one from last night! That's the truck! The one from last night! Right... Bean?! Son of a bitch! Using the same truck for both the setup and the getaway... What a bunch of idiots! You don't make me look like a criminal and escape with a slap on the wrist! I'm gonna make mincemeat out of you! Stay cool. It's OK to get wild... ...as long as you don't send the $2 million up in smoke. I know, I know. I'm going to get every last cent! The big prize should be in the trailer. I'll unhook it! Hey, wait! Hey, wait! The accelerator will stay put! Take the wheel! Bean! That was too much, idiot! That was too much, idiot! Oh, sorry... That was too much, idiot! Oh, sorry... What's going on? I thought the trailer was going to get wiped out! That Roadbuster asshole has found us! Things are going to get bumpy, so hang on! You're not getting away! Oh shit! Damn! Fuck it! If it's come down to this, then... Fuck it! If it's come down to this, then... Come on! Faster! They're gaining on us! Well, I'll tell you... I've got an ace in the hole. Get my bag, it's down on the floor! Hey, where is it? Sorry about that... Idiots! That's a dead end! Rick's dead. We're getting out in this. Are they that desperate? Bean! Brakes! That did the trick! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Hey! Where are you...? Hey! Where are you...? They'll get us if we stay on the highway! We'll lose them in the city! Well, that was fun, “Maurice.” Now it's my turn! Hey, Bean! Our little princess seems to have passed out again. I like it quiet. Now I can settle down and collect that $2 million - with interest. Interest? Interest? Their fucking lives... Inspector, please don't be so angry! You were right in front of him, so there was nothing we could do! If anyone had taken a shot, you might have been hit! Shut it! I spared no effort to hunt down this Cobra! I also spent a shitload of time and money restoring it! And because I'm surrounded by useless fuckups, it was all for nothing! I'd have to be nuts not to be royally pissed off! Listen! Screw up like this again... Listen! Screw up like this again... Zebra 6, come in... Zebra 6... Zebra 6, come in... Zebra 6... ...and I'll bash your head in! Zebra 6, come in... Zebra 6... Zebra 6, come in... Zebra 6... This is Zebra 6. What is it? Zebra 6, come in... Zebra 6... This is Zebra 6. What is it? This is Zebra 6. What is it? Uh, yes, sir! We've located the Roadbuster. Uh, yes, sir! We've located the Roadbuster. What?! Uh, yes, sir! We've located the Roadbuster. What?! What?! Eastbound on Grand Avenue at high speed. Eastbound on Grand Avenue at high speed. Isn't Grand Avenue...? Eastbound on Grand Avenue at high speed. ALL RIGHT! One more time! Roadbuster...! Shove it, asshole! That hurt, shithead! Wait a second. This is a 10-gauge solid slug! They use these at roadblocks! Calling all cars! The suspects are heading west on Hubbard! Block the road with your cars if you have to, but stop them! They just passed LaSalle Street! Haul ass! No matter what, don't lose them! Rally! We're going to take them out in one shot! I'll swing around to their left! You blow a hole through their engine! Do you think a KTW .44 Magnum will be enough? Excellent choice! No good, Inspector! They got away! I know that already! Out of my way! OK! Fire! OK! Fire! N0! They've got Papa! Rally...! Rally. . .! Sorry! Never underestimate a V12 engine! A drag race through the heart of downtown? I like your style! Shit! Yeah, that V12 really hangs tough! Slowpoke! We've lost the Roadbuster. Cars not involved in the accident, search the Wells Street area. Where's Percy? What happened to him? His car was wrecked in a multi-vehicle collision! His car was wrecked in a multi-vehicle collision! This ain't a sideshow, you idiots! Bean! Bean! Watch the kid. Watch the kid. Yeah, yeah... Watch the kid. Uh... That man... He'll save my papa, won't he? He's going after the bad guys... So he's a good guy, right? Really, is that the face of a good guy? It's all right. He's a scoundrel, but he dreams of being the good guy. So he watches at least two heroic movies a week. You live up to your reputation, Bean Bandit. I'm amazed that you tracked me down... I didn't expect you'd drive me to this. A woman. . .'? Last night's setup was really something, wouldn't you agree? What are you talking about? You used the same trailer for your getaway... ...that you used to block the street. You're just amateurs, after all. Your finding us was just a coincidence, right? I've already hidden the money in another car. Even if you kill me, the cops will find it before you do. Well? Want to make a deal? With your car and my hostage, we could make it to Mexico. You'll get 500 grand as a shipping fee. If you want to escape, I'll help you all I can. What do you say? I'm hoping for the $2 million, the hostage, and your lives... The works! Is he a monster?! Stay put, OK? Freeze! Don't get any smart ideas! I've got a cocked Python pointed at the brat's head! Throw your gun over here so we don't have any accidents. I can't just meekly go along with whatever you tell me to do. That's your partner in disguise, isn't it? I don't care what you think! Throw me your gun or I'll blow her brains out! At this point, I'm desperate enough to do it! All right. We can't escape you. I'll make it a million. With that you could even build a house in Tokyo! OK, $1.1 million. $1.2 million! You've got nothing to gain by fighting any further! NO! Stop it! Please, stop! We'll give you the whole $2 million! Stay out of this, you little brat! Freeze! Right. You stay just like that. Drop the knife. Thinking of making a friend into a hostage? I just did. What matters to you isn't whether it's a friend or foe... ...but whether or not it's a kid. Bean Bandit... I checked you out very carefully. You're a true monster. You should have changed your plans after you figured that out. Hardly. You have a serious flaw... ...your soft spot for kids. The fact that you're just standing there proves it. Drop it! Idiot. Semmer! Hurry it UP! All right. I'll throw it, OK? I like a sensible girl. Use your left hand, and hold it by the barrel. That's it. Ah-ah! Put your right hand on top of your head! Now throw it! That's enough! I'll tell you which car we hid the money in! Carrie! Carrie! We're no match for him! Please! I'll tell you where it is if you let us go! We'll never work here again! Deal. Deal. In the third row from the north side, right near the center... ...there's a Benz wagon. It's a silver... CARRIE! CARRIE! NO! SEMMER! All cars present! All cars present! North entrance completely blocked! North entrance completely blocked! What about the civilians? North entrance completely blocked! What about the civilians? What about the civilians? They've all been evacuated! Inspector, why don't we just charge in there? With this many men, he wouldn't last a second! Charge in? I wouldn't go to all this trouble if regular tactics worked against him! That takes care of that. Will you be all right? The police are covering the exit... The main thing on my mind right now isn't all the patrol cars out there... ...but rather, “What am I going to eat for dinner?” Now are you sure this is OK, paying me the $2 million and all? It's a bargain. Call me up anytime you need me. I'll give you a discount next time around. Yo... The street is crawling with cops. Want a lift? Since you helped us get the loot, it's free. Now, now... Now, now... I've still got two shots left. I've still got two shots left. Cut it out. I've still got two shots left. You'd look better holding a lollipop than a .45. Semmerling is dead. How come only you survived? Are you saying it's my fault? Are you saying it's my fault? Damn right I am! Damn right I am! As much as it hurts... Damn right I am! ...you know exactly why the gas blew up, don't you? Come on out, Roadbuster! You scared of me? Chickening out? Give me a break! Hey, she's out like a light. I bet she's exhausted. Honestly, since when did the back of my car become a crib? Do you suppose it'll be harder for us to work in the city? Want to move on? Don't be silly! Big-hearted rich guys, out-and-out slimeballs... Come out and play, Roadbuster! Come out and play, Roadbuster! Louder'. ...and these crazy cops... ...and these crazy cops... Come on out, Roadbuster! Come on out, Roadbuster! We can still have fun here! Come on out, Roadbuster! Japanese names in the credits are listed in Japanese order, family name first.
