( majestic theme playing ) CARLO: Be respectful. Federico Barone is a great man. ( Carlo speaks indistinctly ) And please remember to breathe deeply. Straighten up, girls. Show off your stuff. ( speaking in French ) That's okay, honey. ( speaking in French ) ( all chattering ) Papa! What's that? Are you in the pay of my enemies? The Pressed Flower is here to win the Golden Palm, not to excite virgins. ( all chattering ) MAN 1: Rolling Break, it's a western. MAN 2: What happened to Missouri Breaks? You change the verses on that? MAN 1: If you don't want it I'll take it to him. It's a bicycle movie, that's what it is. MAN 2: It's a good title. How about making your surfing picture? ( Man 1 laughs ) ( woman speaking indistinctly on PA ) ( all chattering ) JACKSON: No, no, no, no. Someone without taste could turn out to have class. OFFICIAL: Your passport, ma'am. Merci. You have my name three times. One, two, three. Take off, uh... This one. ( chattering ) ( woman speaking indistinctly on PA ) WOMAN ( on PA ): Immediate boarding, gate number 10. ( men speaking in French ) What's that? It's my film. ( dog barks ) The tracks aren't wide enough. Don't worry. ( official speaking in French ) Hmm? HAL: Proforma invoice, customs bond document. Has declaration of intent attached. All signed and stamped. Open them. Yeah. CARLO: I'm Carlo Barone. Barone. MARIA: Oh, a dog in my bag. Very interesting. Shut that. ( speaking in French ) MARIA: Oh, poor puppy. No, no, no. What are you doing? OFFICIAL: We have to keep them. Why? Because it's the law, sir. You don't understand. The film's not entered in the competition. I brought it to sell. It's not in the competition. I have all the papers. That's your problem, sir, not mine. HAL: What do you mean that's my problem? When do I get the film back? I told you that's your problem. I'll give you a receipt, okay? Shit! ( majestic theme playing ) ( grunts ) ( majestic theme playing ) ( truck honking ) ( truck honks ) ( majestic theme playing ) ( horn honking ) ( tires screeching ) ( shouting in French ) Okay, okay. ( woman shouting in French ) Okay, okay! Christ. ( horns honking ) ( whistle blowing ) ( man speaking in French ) RONA: Good morning, David. Good morning, America. I'm here in Cannes. French Riviera, beautiful beaches and balmy weather make it a favorite haven for the wealthy who wanna get away from it all. But for the next 14 days in May, Cannes has changed into a highly charged, tension-filled marketplace with the best and worst movies from all over the world are up for grabs. Ugh! ( sighs ) Here you are, Papa. Teletype, three telephones. Maid, with paper. Just the way you like it. Can't this wait till the end of the festival? You promised Mr. Bart you'd drink this one. MAN: But no radio. This is an art film, sir. We want to open at the cinema... ( engines roaring ) ( phone rings ) Hello? Hi. No, I just got here. No, it's great. I got all modern conveniences. I got a telephone and a television. ( plane engine roaring ) Well, it looks like a 727. No, it's not bad. They probably don't land at night anyway. Yeah, I miss you too. Oh, I had a small problem with that. No, it's nothing serious. I'm sure I can work it out. Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, you're right, it's time. Okay. One, two, three. ( loud grunting ) ( laughs ) Okay. I love you too. Listen, I'm talking Street Car Named Desire. I know it's remake but Vanessa thinks they'd be wonderful. Vanessa is going to play Vivien Leigh. Yes. There's no 7Up. Then forget Burma. I'm not staying here without 7Up. I hate Pepsi. Shut up your mouth, my little darling, will you? Ciao. What is this shit? I threw this out two hours ago and now it's back like a ghost! ( sneezes ) Get me a poster. Okay, everybody out. Oh-- Out! CARLO: Out. Out. Everybody. Out! Out. ( sighs ) Your flowers are beautiful. ( chuckles ) ( soft theme playing ) ( water running ) ( crowd chattering ) No, no. I feel quite humbled to have a picture in the competition. It's a privilege and an honor to be in a community of artists. It's too bad there has to be winners and losers. Because there are no losers in art. You are only artists. ( laughing ) ( melancholy theme playing ) ( sighs ) Couldn't sleep either, huh? Man, this jetlag kills you. Shouldn't be sleeping. Gotta wheel and deal. So this is where it all happens? ANDREW: This is the place, Beverly Hills, France. HAL: Is this the first time you've been to "Cahnne"? It's Cannes. I was here last year with Cincinnati Blackie. Oh, sure. You were in Cincinnati Blackie. Wrote, directed, starred in, designed the costumes, and cut it. Stuck a broom up my ass, I had to sweep out the studio. ( both laugh ) I'm surprised you heard about Cincinnati Blackie. I even saw it. Nobody saw it outside of Harlem west of Nigeria. Well, I see everything. Ooh, one of those. ( both chuckle ) Is that your new film? I am here with one of the greatest titles ever. Sir Walter Nigger. How does that strike your chord? Can't wait to go out and spend my $3. Four. This is gonna be a first run all the way. What's your flick about? It's about Gary Gilmore. You know, the guy who demanded he be executed. This is a documentary? Nonfiction. What's the title? Choice of Ending. You think that up yourself or you got a kid brother? I did it all myself, same as you. That's one of the first things you're gonna have to change. Actually, that's the least of my problems. Customs took my only print. No problem. Be firm, no take no shit off of them. Excuse me. Good morning. May I introduce myself-- Ugh! Oh. Ha, ha. Did you ever run for the Pioneer Track Club in Brooklyn? ( speaks in French ) I swear I know that stride from somewhere. ( speaks in French ) Well, it was nice meeting you, sugar. ( chuckles ) What seems to be the problem, Mr. Raymond? That's what I'd like to know. You guys took my film. And you're gonna get it back. Right. I'm here for the festival, unless I can get it out-- Ah, yes. I knew there were some mistakes. Ah, good. I'm glad someone knows. Well, it's not that you cannot get your film out. It's that you cannot bring your film in. It's already in. You've got it. I just want it back. Of course you do. May I see your passport please? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Everything's in order. You're all set. You mean I get my film? You'll get it out, yes. And you get to take it back. Back where? America, of course. Let's see, your TWA has a flight at 1800. There you are, 1800. We'll have you on the beach at Malibu in no time. Now, wait a second. You're gonna give me back my film, right? Oh, naturally. We are not a nation of thieves. But if I get the film back out, I can't bring it back in? Not until the censor sees it. No one told me about the censor. They should have. Well, when can I see it? He's very busy, you know. He's very busy. His wife's relatives are visiting and then there is the festival, all that. I don't know. Perhaps next month. Well, then I'm screwed. Uh, look at this way, you're young, you have your whole life ahead of you. ( men speaking in French ) ( Maria speaking in Italian and Mortimer barking ) ( Mortimer barking ) ( speaking in Italian ) ( Maria speaking in Italian ) Ugh! Son of a bitch! ( speaking in Italian ) Are you all right? Who? Are you feeling well? Oh, yeah, I feel fine. Yeah, I feel terrific. Never felt better in my life. I'm deliriously happy. Good. I'm sorry. Minor setback, I'll be okay. Thanks for asking. I see you got him out. ( barking ) Yes. You can get dogs out around here, just not movies. I'm sorry, I'm a little crazed right now. You've come to the right place. Well, I wasn't crazed when I got here. Perfectly sane. You should've known me then. I saw them take your film at the airport. Is that why you are upset? I made that film. I brought it 5,000 miles. I got all the papers, I've filled out all the forms. No one told me about the censor. That's too bad. Yeah. Can you do anything about it? Sure. I'm gonna go pack my bags, I'm gonna get on the plane, I'm gonna pick up my film, and I'm gonna go home. That's a shame. Yeah. There must be something you can do. I don't know what. You just cannot take your film and go home if it means so much to you. It took me two years to make that film. I hocked everything I own. It's my life. Then you have to fight for it. Fight who? City hall? I guess it's none of my business. No, I appreciate your interest. It's very nice of you. Thank you. You're very nice. There's my car. Goodbye. Bye. ( soft theme playing ) And thank you for the lift. ( in French accent ): Oh, you're quite welcome, mademoiselle. ( crowd chattering ) MAN 1: You know how fond I am with you and Irene. I am. But I have done-- The award is Tuesday. So, what should I do? Should I leave town for a few days and low key it? MAN 2: I think you should-- I have so much anxiety for a film screening that I could have an anxiety attack just sitting here. WOMAN: I don't want you to have an anxiety attack. MAN 3: How did you like directing Gorilla? There was no possible direction. It was just love and relationship. ( men speaking in Italian ) About five or six, which are pornographic and very tough. Violent is not necessarily the right word. And none of it is, uh-- MAN 4: You think that's commercial? If I knew what was commercial, I'd be-- You know, change my name to Nostradamus. None of it is gratuitous. All is within... MAN 5: I wanna see what they're gonna say in Des Moines and Denver. WOMAN 2: Des Moines and Denver. You shouldn't. You don't care what we have to say in Los Angeles. MAN 6: Kiss me one time, now. Cary, if you come up here, I will kiss you. You can come up here. ( all chattering ) WOMAN: Oh, you kiss like crazy. ( crowd cheering ) WOMAN: No, no, no. You called me over, might as well look. ( crowd cheering and horns honking ) ( crowd cheering ) ( crowd chattering ) FARRAH: Yeah, I think so. I still have my close friends and I still do my normal everyday things. I'm still a housewife, I'm still a wife, you know. WOMAN: I don't know how you manage to do it. It seems like you have-- You have an incredible sparkle. You're still looking kind of beautiful. Thank you. ( speaking in French ) Homosexual. Western. ( speaking in French ) Just hold the screening date, that's all. You can do that. I can also walk on water. You don't know how hard it is around here getting a screening room. You've got one. Sure, I got one. You got your picture? I'll get it, don't worry. I never worry. Do I look like a man who worries? When you get it, just let me know. We'll talk. After The Pressed Flower we will do Streetcar with Charles Bronson. ( man speaking in Chinese ) Bruce Lee. CARLO: But it's wrong, Bruce Lee. It's like he's dead. He's dead. ( speaking in Italian ) Hey. Oh, hello. Hi. I see you are still here. Yeah, I've decided to stay and fight. Good. I should thank you for that. No reason to thank me. You turned my head around. I have this tendency sometimes, you know. When I get mad, I'd take my marbles and leave. Marbles? In a manner of speaking, marbles. Ah. ( Mortimer barking ) Whoa! Taking him for a walk? Seems he's taking me. You had lunch yet? I never have lunch. What? I said I never have lunch. Oh. Well, I'm starving. You should have something. I can eat enough for two. ( man speaking in French ) ( all chattering ) You're impressed? Very. Never had any trouble with my appetite. I can always eat. Me too. That's why I don't have a lunch. How about breakfast? Well, a little. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That's when you stoke the furnace. You should eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. Heh. I mean, in nutrition. I see that. It's all chemical. You are what you eat. I don't remember who said that. You drink, though? A little. Everything in moderation, huh? You don't approve? Well, if it works for you. It does. Great. No, no, no. ( speaking in French ) No, it's no good. ( waiter speaks in French ) That's right. Will you take it back, please? This is not important. I don't like being stiffed just because I'm American. Oh. You are too sensitive. No, just stubborn. Uh, problem with the wine? It's turned. We do not serve wine that has turned. Well, don't take my word for it, taste it yourself. Perhaps a touch too much acidity for the American palate, monsieur. I have found that you prefer your wines with less character. You'll also find the grapes in this particular vintage remained too long in the vine due to the unseasonable rainfall. No need to throw the wine out. You can use it for salad dressing. ( speaks in French ) Is that true? I don't know. ( both laugh ) You know, perhaps my husband can help you with your film. He has dealings with the censor. That's another way. That would be great. Thank you. Who's your husband? Federico Barone. The producer? Mm. I've seen his films. ( chuckles ) You like them? Well, he certainly knows what the public wants. You can say what you think about them. Even our daughter does. You have a daughter? Eleven years old. And a stepson and a dog. And a husband. He might be able to help you. You're on. Waiter. Check, please. But you finished your lunch? It's okay. In this business, you gotta stay hungry. Ah. WOMAN ( on PA ): Paging John Travolta or Richard, please. ( sighs ) FREDDIE: This is A Streetcar Named Desire we are talking about. I've got Vanessa to play Vivien Leigh. You play Marlon Brando. We go heavy on the art with this. You got to cry in the end. ( Mortimer barking) Sure it is. It is very macho to cry these days. I cry all the time. I cry now, Charlie. Right now. Don't cry, Papa. You see art and heart, Charlie. They go together. The fans would love to see you cry. The public loves to see all of us cry. Bronson cries. That alone is worth a million bucks. Okay, Charlie, ciao, ciao, ciao. What a laugh, he won't cry. With his wrinkles, who would know? This is Mr. Raymond, darling. Hello, nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. An American who needs help. Usually it is we who need the help from America. ( laughs ) He has made a film which is in the hands of the censor. Which he cannot get out. I get it out, I just can't get it in. I thought perhaps since you know the censor-- You made this film yourself? That's right. FREDDIE: Ah. For how much? Three hundred thousand. Thirty-five millimeter? No, 16, blown up to 35. Mine is 35 all the way. ( chuckles ) Well, actually, I wanted the graininess. It's a very grainy story. And are you showing this picture at the festival? No, I'm just trying to sell it. Well, why you didn't say so? Nothing competition, ah, well, you shall have your picture before you can say Cock Robinson. Make a note to call the censor. Yes. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. It's an honor for me to be able to help a fellow filmmaker. Well, I wish I could return the favor. What are you doing tonight? Tonight? HAL: Um, a friend of mine, maybe you saw him at the pool. Andrew Jackson. He's giving a party. There'd be some good jazz, maybe you'd like to come. Uh, no, unfortunately, I have a meeting. You go, Maria. You know I don't like parties. If you change your minds, it's in Nice, in the old city. 22 Rue Balzac. I don't think so. Anyway, thank you. No, thank you very much. You don't know what this means to me. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Very nice fellow. Where did you meet him? At the airport. When I went to get Mortimer back. ( sighs ) Three more days and we'll know the worst. Or the best. ( laughs ) ( speaking in French ) ( Andrew speaking indistinctly ) ( speaking in French ) ANDREW: Payola, man. Books, tie-ins, the name of the game, man. You take like this cat your flick is about. What's his name, Fillmore? Gilmore. Dude smokes, don't he? Okay, you show the name of his brand, a grateful cooperation hands you 10 grand. The cat drinks, right? Okay. You show that brand, another 10 grand. No, no. Before you know it, you got half your pre-production. Even if he's a killer? For a little free advertising, and he could be Adolf Hitler and black. ( Hal laughs ) HAL: They never taught us that in film school. ( jazz music playing ) There's your chick, man. Karen? No, that foxy lady with the dog. Hi. Hello. Andrew Jackson, Maria Barone. Welcome to Beverly Hills, France. Would you care to dance, drink, smoke, or snort? Nothing, thank you. "From nothing comes nothing." That, my man, is a quote. King Lear. And you thought I was all flash. ( chuckles ) ANDREW: You seen this man's motion picture, madame? No. Not since Citizen Kane has there been a directorial debut of such magnitude. Oh. I'm impressed. Yeah, me too. You are in the presence of the new Terry Malick. Christ. Who? Exactly. I must mingle. Bless you, my children. Une moment, mon sweets! Uh, danser tu avec moi, baby. ( speaking in French ) He hasn't seen my film. Must be a very good friend, then. He's also a little smashed. Me too. I'm glad you came. It's only for a little while. I cannot stay long. Did you come alone? Yes. I took a taxi. ( band playing upbeat jazzy music ) You wanna dance? Yeah. ( playing upbeat jazzy music ) Come on, huh? Time for refill. ( woman laughs ) ( sighs ) Kind of hard keeping that face on all the time, ain't it, Jack? Me too. Boys' High School. Julia Richman. Eastern Parkway. 138th Street. ( both laughing ) Just getting the money was a nightmare. I pawned practically everything I had. Pawned? Hocked. When you give them something then they give you money and a ticket. Oh, yes. We had done that, many times. Oh, to make a film, of course. Only to eat? But you've succeeded. Jackson says I did it the wrong way. Today, you're supposed to sell them first, then make them. Oh. It's what my husband does. Except for the film he brings here now. This one is serious. You were in some of his first films, weren't you? ( chuckling ): Yeah. Until we married. The hair was different then. I like it better now. I was terrible actress. Still terrible, being terrible. People are kind, you don't believe them. If they are truthful, you hate them. I think you're beautiful. I think... I will have another drink. ( band playing funky music ) ( laughing ) ( scatting ) ( laughs ) MARIA: Coffee, I try not to drink it. HAL: Coffee? Yeah. Keeps you awake? No, it puts me to sleep. My father always give it to me before I went to bed. He gave you coffee? Sure. When you were little? Yes. My father always. It put him to sleep. So they use it for all the children. That's incredible. You don't believe me? Sure, I believe you, but it's incredible. Good. Because I always say the true. The truth. That's what I said, true. True. ( speaks in French ) ( chuckles ) ( engine starts ) Shall I take you home? Yes. If you have to ask. You cook here in the room? Oh, that. No, I use that to time telephone calls to my girlfriend. I have husband, why shouldn't you have a girlfriend? She's in America? Mm-hm. California. Mm. But we have an arrangement. For the telephone calls? No, I mean... We each live our own lives, you know. It's like an open marriage, only we're not married. Ah. I don't understand. How can a marriage be open and still be marriage? Well, it's like it's free, you know. Ah. We're not into the jealousy bag. Each person does what he wants and it's okay with the other. You wanna sleep with someone, you just do it. And the other person knows about it. Sure. It's what makes it open. ( chuckles ) I'm sure you have that kind of thing in Europe. Of course. I mean, you and your husband, you're both sophisticated people. I'm sure you've had lots of affairs. Both of you. Naturally. So there's no reason for us to feel guilty. Maybe you might not tell your husband about it, but-- I always tell my husband. You do? Yes. That's what makes us very sophisticated. So you'll tell him about us? Will you tell your girl? Oh, sure. And it will be fine with her? Absolutely. You wanna be with your husband? Absolutely. Right. I'll go back, I'll tell him that I slept with you. It will be very fine. He'll understand? Perfectly. He's very sophisticated. Like me. I'll tell him and we'll go to find his gun and he will shoot me. Then he will find you and shoot you. You're kidding? Yes, I'm kidding. You know, I have been married 14 years, and I never slept with anyone except my husband until now. And I don't know why I've done it now. I don't know why I've done it with an American boy who is not married openly. That has made a film for $300,000. That is not even a 35 mm all the way. But I have. And you're sorry. I don't know. Guilty? I don't think so. But it wasn't good for you. It was wonderful. For me too. Well, you have more experience. I was lying. ( chuckles ) I've never been unfaithful to Karen before. Or with anyone I've been with. But you haven't this open thing? I always felt that if you were with someone that's who you are with. Otherwise, why be with them? That is very unsophisticated. I know. Heh. I'm ashamed of it sometimes. And old-fashioned. Uh-huh. That makes me very happy. ( sighs ) Welcome home. WOMAN: And I have this button. MAN: You do indeed. WOMAN: You wear it on your shirt MAN: Oh, I wouldn't. WOMAN: Take the Deep Dive button. And then I have this paper. It tells all about it. It's called a flyer. And this tells the synopsis of the whole movie that I wrote. Contact Edy Williams. And some pictures that were in Playboy. Yes. Yes. This is his contact, Edy Williams in Mont Fleuri. And that's till I come over to this address. Then if that isn't good enough, here's the treatment that I wrote. It's very easy to read and it's got a budget in it. The budget is only $300,000. MAN: What's the movie about? Hey, George. ( laughing ) WOMAN: She's not afraid to go out in the world all on her own. ( all chattering ) WOMAN: The thing about this picture is the billboard for the film. MAN: Yeah, billboards. But this is really a work of art. I mean, even women like this because it's beautiful. It's in the water. It's like spacey. It's like better than Star Wars. Your poster? I'm gonna show you the poster. Okay? Everybody really seems to like it. MAN: That's the same poster you had here last year, isn't it? WOMAN: Everybody-- Yes, I had it last year, but I didn't have a script for it so I wrote a script to go with the poster. ( photographers shouting ) ( crowd chattering ) Hey, man, how are you doing? What's happening? Hey. I got something to show you, your birthday present. Me? Yeah, come on. What is it? Voila! Voila, what? That's your picture. That? ANDREW: I took the liberty of putting the campaign to bed. Grabs you, don't it? How do you like it? I didn't give you permission to do that. Well, it's too late. Excuse me. "Shoot Me Before I Kill Again"? Like it? I hate it. What's wrong? It's a good title. It's commercial. The title is just a marketing tool. HAL: It's terrible. ANDREW: It's beautiful. I like my title. You haven't even seen the movie. I've seen you, and from what I see in you, you need all help you can get, my man. Look, Andrew, I appreciate your interest, but I did not make an exploitation film. Do you want real people to see this film, or just your relatives, huh? Choice of Ending expresses the movie. Man, that title wouldn't draw tourists into Radio City Music Hall if the Rockettes dance naked. Did I spell your name right here? You know, I wanted it red and white. Blood colors, man. No, no, no. You only gave me two days. Hey, trust me. No, no! I've got an added attraction for you. Girls, give it to him. I don't believe this. What's this for? Each girl represents close ties with three territories. It was Jackson's idea, but my designs. How do you like them? Oh, they're terrific. You are American? I'm from no underdeveloped nation. CLERK: Phone call, Mr. Raymond. For me? Mr. Raymond. It must be the coast. Okay, girls, take a break. Hello? Hi. How you doing? How did you know I was here? ( chuckles ) Right now? Sure. No. Okay. The Palm Beach. I can? Oh, yeah. Okay. All right, I'll see you there. ( all chattering ) ( all chattering ) ( croupiers speaking in French ) Why don't you try another number? Because it's my lucky number. Eleven. ( croupiers speaking in French ) Doesn't seem so lucky to me. Because it's lucky does not mean it comes up every time, eh? ( croupier speaking in French ) ( croupier speaking in French ) Shouldn't it come up at least once? ( croupier speaking in French ) I brought all my money like you said. Not a hell of a lot. Would you mind telling me what you plan to do with it as if I didn't know? ( croupier speaking in French ) Hey, it's me, I'm here. What do I do now? You are moving out of that hotel. It embarrasses me. It happens to be the only hotel I can afford. That's why you are here. So I can increase your money. You can afford a better hotel. I know just the place. ( croupier speaking in French ) Wouldn't I have a better chance if I just went and robbed a bank? Hey, we gotta talk about this. I'm very lucky gambler. HAL: Uh-huh. Fantastic. It's all in the feeling. If you feel unlucky, you will lose. Tonight, I will win. I think because of you. Sure! Sure! ( croupier speaking in French ) ( croupier speaking in French ) No! No, no, no. ( Maria speaking in Italian ) What did I do to deserve this? Which saint did I offend? Sorry. I've been waiting three years for this number to come up. I could shoot myself. You have a gun? I will do it for you. Give me your money. We will play craps. And if you'll talk to me, I will strangle you with my bare hands. ( Maria speaking in French ) Hit! ( Maria cheering and speaking in Italian ) Bellissimo, we win! Luck! ( laughs ) Once more. ( all chattering and laughing ) Wonderful! Hey! Terrific! No, no. No, no. You're not gonna get another. Wait. No, no, once more. Once more. Please. Maria, come on. ( Maria screaming ) ( speaking in Italian ) Back, back. No. No. Come on, come on. Goodbye. Thank you very much. ( chattering and laughing ) ( majestic theme playing ) ( laughing ) ( mellow theme playing ) ( Mortimer barking ) MARIA: This hotel is better, huh? Oh, yeah. Better. Did you forget something? What's that cop from the airport doing there? Don't look at him. He seems to be eating his lunch. ( Hal sighs ) I better go see what he wants. Yeah. Meet me in the room? Okay. Hello. Hello. What a pleasant surprise. I've been looking for you. Yeah? I wish to tell you about your film. What about my film? The censor will see it now. You mean that? I understand his wife's relatives have suddenly returned to Corsica. Ah. Yeah. So you are staying here now? Yeah, I'm just moving in. Yes, and with the beautiful Madame Barone, you are a lucky man, Hal. No, look, she's not moving in with me. Of course not. She has come for the bouillabaisse. She's a friend. She just told me about the place, came to show me where it is. She has a kind heart, Madame Barone. I could tell from the way she treated her dog. Look, don't you have anything better to do than to spy on me? We are not a nation of snoops. Your private life is your own. No matter how sordid. ( Mortimer barking ) Maria? MARIA: Hal. Good news. The censor's back. He can see my film. Fabulous. Yeah. What do you think of it? What? The room. Oh. Yeah, it's great. MARIA: Why you don't come and take your bath? Well, I really gotta call and make arrangements. Montand gave me his number. MARIA: He will be having his lunch. I thought I'd try him anyway. Why you don't take a bath first? No, I took a shower this morning. A bath is more relaxing. But if I call him now, I might be able to get my film up in a night. You are not in America. You're in France. And you'll get nothing here during lunchtime. Except trouble for your liver. I guess there's no point calling him if he's gonna be out to lunch. Maybe you should call him. You'll feel better. I think I'll feel better if I took a bath first. Here. Ah. What is this? It's for my film. You like it? Do you? Well... I didn't like it at first, but... I don't know, I guess it's okay for now. Hmm. That's a hell of a tub. ( chuckles ) I love a big bathtub. When I was little, I took my bath in the kitchen sink. Didn't you have a tub? We were lucky to have a sink. ( sighs ) Mm. You're very skinny, aren't you? Actually I'm very fat. I'm just tall for my weight. How long do they take for lunch around here? Long enough. ( mellow theme playing ) HAL: This is great. Finally out of the traffic. You wanna drive? I don't know how. You don't know how to drive? No. Oh, Maria, you'd never make it in L.A. It's just that I was first too poor to have a car, then too rich to drive. ( majestic theme playing ) Oh, isn't this wonderful? Great. No trees. Sure there are. ( Mortimer barking ) Where? Right over that hill. Follow me. ( mellow theme playing ) MARIA: I love trees. HAL: Yeah, so does your dog. MARIA: Morty. ( birds chirping ) You okay? I'm fine. I'm very strong in the feet. Try some of this. What is it? Trail mix. Seeds? Yeah. Sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. I eat them all the time. You eat seeds? Sure. It gives you energy on the trail. Heh. In my country, we put seeds in the ground, what comes up, we eat. ( chuckles ) These are different. Try it. Do they make you fat? You're really crazy, you know it? I'm crazy? I mean, worried about being fat. You eat seeds, but I'm crazy. I worry about being fat, being old, being poor. Is there something better to worry about? You're not fat. You're not old and you're rich. But it's very easy to lose money and gain weight. And everybody gets old. You don't quit, do you? I mean, we can keep this up all day if you want. No, we won't. Because we are sitting on wet ground and we are about to be eaten by ants. ( laughing ) HAL: Why do you wanna worry about anything? What if you don't have anything to worry about? What if you don't have anything to worry about? Will you please stop repeating everything I say? It's because I cannot believe what I hear. Are you an animal? Are you an idiot? How can you be human and not worry? Because I have everything I want. It could disappear tomorrow. But it's here today and that's what counts. A lightning could come from the sky and kill you dead. Could you catch a disease? Your teeths could fall out. My tits could fall out? Yes, your teeths. Your teeths could fall out. My teeth? Ha-ha-ha! I could get fat. A car can run you over. You could go swimming and be eaten by a shark. I could lose you. Do you worry about that? No. Yeah. There's no need to worry. The festival's almost over. It will be only the end of the festival. I eat seeds, remember? I know. I will have to get used to that. Prepare to cast off. Aye, aye, captain. Batten down the hatches. Huh? Uh, aye, aye, captain. Hoist the main sail and cast off. Aye, casting off. Cast off. ( screaming ) America! America! ( Maria screams then laughs ) ( both laugh ) ( speaks in Italian ) ( laughing ) HAL: I hate this. I hate bringing you back. I wanna wake up in the morning with you. I don't look that cheerful. Maybe I can cheer you up. We have to spend at least one whole night together. Yes. Can't you arrange something? I never lie to Freddie. Not once. Not the smallest thing. Just this week, I'm becoming very good at it. I don't want you to do it if you don't want to. Hmm. You would like for it to be nice and clean, no lies, nobody hurt. I would like that too. ( chuckles ) It would be nice if it were possible. I will arrange something. FREDDIE: Oh, damn it. The Sergio Silverman gets the front page. Why The Pressed Flower is always on the back page? Maria. Maria, you're not feeling okay? No, no. No yes? Or yes no? Would you be terribly mad if I went to Paris for a couple of days? I'll be back for the screening. Of course not, pussycat. I understand perfectly. GIRL: Paris. Can I come too? No, darling. I mean, yes, darling, if you want, but I... Thank you, Mama. If you have time, you could help me, Maria. Stop by Cartier and pick up my new watch. Will you do that for me? I... Stop it. Back off. Shut up, both of you. I'm thickheaded sometimes, but you two win the prize for it. Can't you see? She needs time for herself? This festival is too important for all of us. Cannes is making us all crazy. Ah. Sure, darling. Go ahead, by yourself. Do some shopping. Relax. We'll see you Friday night for The Pressed Flower, hmm? Save me a seat. Yeah, I just found out about it. It's great, huh? Sure, bring her along. The more the merrier. So you know where it is? Okay. ( knock on door ) Just a second. Okay, I'll see you tonight. Yeah. Bye. Hi. Hey, I'm here. ( sighs ) You are not expecting me. Huh? You're expecting someone else. Oh, no. Of course not. Come on in. You too, Mortimer. No, I was just kind of surprised at all the luggage. Did you think I would come naked? Well, it's a lot for a sleepover. I will leave. No, no. I'm kidding. I'm joking. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. I just found out the censor's seeing my film tonight. Fabulous. Will we get champagne? Suppose he doesn't like it? It doesn't matter if he likes it. Only that he gives the tape. It matters to me. Does he pay for his tickets? No. So it doesn't matter. I guess I just want the whole world to like it. Especially you. I'm glad you're here. How long did you come for? I have to be back for Freddie's screening. You know what I thought? What? If we're so close, we will go to Italy. Oh, that's a great idea. We will have some real food and not these miserable French stuff. Pasta. It's fattening. Not in Italy. ( chuckling ): Oh. We leave after we have seen your film. Remember, I want you to tell me the truth. Why should I lie? We're not married. ( chuckles ) I'd like to thank you all for being here. I just hope that the reels are in the proper order. Um, I'm not used to showing a final print. Most of the time, it's just been bits and pieces in order to get money. Uh, about what you're going to see, I guess you'd say it's kind of cross between... Cinema vérité and film noir. There's a lot of Sam Fuller in it, uh... Um, you French people will notice this. It has some of the documentary quality of your André Cayatte. ( Maria whispering indistinctly ) And also I owe a great deal to Edgar Ulmer. That's obvious. The early Edgar Ulmer. Ah. Anyway, uh, none of you are here to listen to me so, um, thanks for coming. ( child giggles ) Charming. ( car honking ) ( crowd chattering ) ( all chattering ) Congratulations, Mr. Raymond. You Americans. Hey, wait a minute. What about my film? Can I bring it in now? Of course. We are not the nation of liars. Man, oh, man, I shove it. Did you like it? Like's not the word for it. I heard that before. What is the word? It was sensational, man. But you gotta change the title. You don't think it works? You're a major cinematic talent, man. What do you think of it? Was it supposed to be that green? She loved it like I loved it. Would I shit you? Your own partner, man? Partner? Yeah, look, you handle the art, I'll handle the commerce. Tomorrow we got a meeting of the board. Come on, sugar. We got a big winner here, man. A big winner. I smell bucks. I'm getting in on this one. I passed on Chainsaw Massacre. I'm not missing this bet. Seen any good films lately? Well, what did you think? You know, there was much I didn't understand. My English is not so good. You hated it. No. I thought you were gonna tell me the truth. Which true? There's only one truth. No, there are many. The true is that I would never see a film like this if I didn't know you. The true is that I didn't like this "Jerry" Gilmore of yours. Nor the actor who played him. I think you cast him because he looked like you. The true is also that it was you who made it. And you who I love. I found a thing to love about the film too. Heh. Either you love it or you don't. You don't heard what I said. Oh, I heard all right. You hated my film. I cannot hate anything you do. Well, did you like it? Some parts. Don't lie to me, Maria. I didn't like it. Okay. That's all I want to know. Now you're angry. Heh. I'm not angry. You've got a right to your opinion, I just wanted you tell me the truth. Ah. I don't think you want the truth. Don't tell me what I want. ( Hal sighs ) I mean, I wanted you to like it, sure, but, heh, if you don't, you don't. Now you don't like me. I love you. Perhaps, but you don't like me. Don't tell me what I like. Why not? I tell you what I like. ( scoffs ) I'm disappointed. In me. In your reaction. No, in me. I have failed you. No, listen to me. It is right not to like me for not liking your film. You'll get over that as you get over the fact that it's not a very good film. Now, wait a minute. You'll go on, make your other films-- Who the hell are you? No, be careful! Be careful! Be careful! ( tires screeching ) Listen, lady, you're talking about my life. No, I'm talking about your film. And films are not a life. That film is worth more than Freddie Barone and every schlock B film-- No, no, no. It is not worth more than Freddie Barone. Films are not worth more than people. When you understand that, perhaps you will make a better film. Thanks for the advice. You want to know what is wrong with your film? I will tell you. It's all about you. Not the people on the screen. I don't need you telling me-- I think you don't need me at all. I think you're right. ( car honks ) Don't forget your film. ( honking ) You know how to drive? MARIA: I will learn! ( tires screeching ) ( gear grinding ) ( whimpering ) ( car honks ) ( tires screeching ) ( melancholy theme playing ) FREDDIE: Maria. I'm back. Good. He wants to take his name off The Pressed Flower. If I don't put back the ten minutes that I cut, he'll call a press conference. That's terrible. Ah, heh. Ungrateful son of a bitch. After I backed him a thousand percent. I fought for his Polish cameraman. I gave him the final cut, United States and Canada. Whatever happened to gratitude and loyalty? I know too well when a producer and director fight each other, the loser is always the picture. So now The Pressed Flower will get ripped by the press and I'll get the blame. Ah, to hell with it. Just a movie, it's not so important. No. It is important. It's special. And it's good. It's you. It's very good. ( chuckles ) Maybe I should not have made it in English. ( melancholy theme playing ) ( sighs ) ( urinating ) ( tense theme playing ) ( bicycle clanking ) ( dramatic theme playing ) ( shouting indistinctly ) ( dramatic theme playing ) FREDDIE: After drinks on my boat, we come back for the screening and you'll see The Pressed Flower, not just the poster. And you'll cry like a baby. ( all laughing ) Hey, good to see you. ( dramatic theme playing ) MARIA: No, don't be silly. The two red boat are not ours. We'll all be going to the boat with the motor launch. We should be there at 2, okay? I'll see you later. Now what is this business Paul tells me you won't cry in the end. Eh, a little glycerin from makeup and you'll cry like a baby. MAN 1: Charles Bronson, yes. MAN 2: Lina is gonna direct. FREDDIE: Yes. ( dramatic theme playing ) Either he cries or the deal is off. I'm not compromising a Barone picture ever again. ( speaking in French ) Please prepare some small Neapolitan pizzas. MAN 1: Listen, Burt Reynolds is... MAN 2: Everybody should be off the boat by 7. The screening starts at 7:30 exactly. Understand? HAL: Excuse me. Can you tell me how to telephone the Barone suite? Can you tell me how to--? Oh, just a second, okay? Can you tell me how to telephone the Barone suite? ( speaking in French ) They left? ( speaking in French ) ( engine starts ) ( tires screeching ) ( dramatic theme playing ) Maria! ( car honking ) ( shouting indistinctly ) Can I talk--? ( honks ) Maria! Maria! What do you want from me? Five minutes! I haven't five minutes. What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid, I'm angry. Do you understand angry? Angry! Because of you. I know exactly how you feel. I felt the same way yesterday. Sure you do. ( boat engine starts ) HAL: Maria, I can't talk to a hat. Would you look at me? MARIA: Leave me alone. HAL: Okay, okay. I don't care. You don't have to look at me, just listen. I don't want to listen. You have to listen. I can't! HAL: It's important that we talk about this. ( man speaking in Italian ) For the last time, goodbye! ( men speaking in Italian ) MARIA: Thank you. Piero. ( man speaking in Italian ) ( men shouting in Italian ) ( Maria shouting in Italian ) Ugh! Hal! ( sighing ) I love you. How do you say that? It means nothing! I also like you. Wanna talk about my film? I don't want to talk at all. I want to go home. If I had any gas, I'd take you home. If you have any sense, we wouldn't be here in the first place. I wanted to talk to you. In the middle of ocean? Well, you wouldn't talk to me anywhere else. I won't talk to you now! What about us? What happens to you and me? Isn't that important? I'm going to miss Freddie's screening. Okay, that's important too. I'm sorry about that. You are a fool. Stupid, selfish fool! But I love you. Oh, Maria, listen to me. I-- I said stupid things. I didn't mean them. I was upset and mad. What you said about my film, that hurt. But I didn't say to hurt! But you wanted the truth! You really didn't like it? Oh, mamma mia! Mamma mia! I have to know what you really think. Why? Is it not enough to love someone? You ran away from me! Of course I did. I'm not your film. I can escape. But if you love me-- Yes! But you insist that I cannot love just you. I must love also your film. You don't know what it means to me. Can you make love with your film? Does it hold you in its arms? Will you have a child with it? Son of film? It's only a thing. It's what I am. Then I don't want you. Heh. You're right. It's only a thing. Things aren't worth more than people. If it comes between people, then... Then to hell with it! ( water splashes ) To hell with it! ( water splashes ) What is in those cans? Two years of my life, that's all. Which I just threw away for you. That was a 35 mm, no? Of course. You made the film 16. So what? So you still have the 16 mm negative. You can make another print from that and you will have your two years back again! I didn't think of that when I did it! You threw away nothing! Do you see that? That's a 1909 S VDB penny. Do you know how rare that is? Was! My favorite tennis shoes. What do you want? The shirt off my back! Things. Things! More things! Things! Things! Things! Things! They are worth nothing! They mean nothing! Less than nothing! Why can't you understand? Why are you such a fool? Why? Why?! Why? Why? Why? I'm a fool, that's all. It's my nature. Say it. I'm a fool. No. Say I'm more important than your film! I thought that's what I've been saying? In those words! You're more-- Why? Because I want you to. You're more important than a film. Your film. My film. You believe that? Yes. Truly? I just don't believe everyone is. Just you. Is that enough? I adore you. ( Maria sighs ) Maria, I told Papa I could find you. HAL: No gas. We ran out of gas. ( Maria speaks in Italian ) ( men speaking in Italian ) CARLO: Okay. Sorry. Ciao. Maria, they loved The Pressed Flower. This is a wonderful night for the Barone family. Yes, really. The screening, Maria, you should've been there. I know. The ovation, people standing, applauding. I have never seen such a success. A success? That's right. Oh, that's wonderful. Even the critics. I'm so happy for Freddie. Can you imagine? Not only people but the critics. Carlo, I'm-- And you know the sequence, the our father with our son? I have to talk to someone. No one moved, no one breathed. And that part we were worried about, What can I do? the double suicide. They cheered. What can I do? Papa is so excited. Now he has a chance at the Golden Palm. That's why we're flying to Geneva tonight, so no one will think he's too anxious. He's waiting at the airport. Maybe I should just run away. Everyone would be better off. But where? Where would I go? First, we have to go the hotel and change. ANDREW: All I can say is that Hal Raymond died for his art. Making a film to him was more important than life itself. REPORTER 1: So he killed himself? ANDREW: We won't know that till the body's recovered. REPORTER 2: Was there a woman involved? ANDREW: Isn't there always with your great artists? Cornel Wilde and Merle Oberon, uh... Paul Henreid and Katharine Hepburn. Scratch that. Jose Ferrer and one of them Gabors. You know what I mean. ( man speaks in Italian ) I'm sorry, I can't understand you. REPORTER 3: He asked if there's a possibility of a murder? See the film. It's all there. But the film is about Gary Gilmore. All true art is about the artist, n'est-ce pas? I predict that the answer to this mystery will be found in the film Shoot Me Before I Kill Again. Straighten up the line, girls. Represented for exclusive worldwide distribution by Andrew Jackson Films. This first and last film of the noted American auteur Hal Raymond will be available for screening just as soon as-- Oh, shit. Man, you sure screwed up this detail. Heh. What could I do? They kidnapped her. I didn't have a chance. I ain't talking about women. I'm talking about what's important. Do you know what it just cost you turning up like that, just when I was getting ready to inform the press you were gone for good? What do you want me to do? Drown? If you had, it would've been worth two million. And I ain't even counting Japan, where that sort of thing goes to the roof. Oh, great. Next time I'll drown. You're a sad dude, you know that? You're really pitiful. All you think about is yourself. Think about your film, man. An artist has got to be willing to die for his art. Just shut up and drive, okay? I've seen it once, I've seen it a hundred times. A pussy come in the door, art goes out the window. ( melancholy theme playing ) ( sighs ) FREDDIE: Next time you will see me, you will see me with A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams. Yes. We go home to Geneva. If the judges agree with the press, then I come back for the ceremony. Mr. Raymond, I've been looking for you once again. May we talk a moment? Sure. Your film, you were seen leaving French territory with it and returning without it. Yeah, that's right. I took it out, I didn't bring it back in. You realize a permit is required to take your film out? Well, it's not really out. I mean, I left with it, but it's still in. Hmm. You're sure of that? Sure, I'm sure. We're not a nation of schmucks. ( Freddie speaking indistinctly ) What are you doing here, Amy? The duke and I are getting married. Barone's giving us a lift. Married? Shh. You're not just black, baby, you're downright dark. Take me to Hong Kong on a honeymoon. Hong Kong? ( speaking in Chinese ) That's enough, honey. The ceremony, at this point, I'm becoming superstitious. ( chuckles ) ( Amy & Andrew speaking indistinctly ) ( all chattering ) Papa, she's coming. Where the hell was she? She ran out of gas in the middle of the ocean. She wanted to drive the boat by herself, and you know how she is with engines. She's even worse with boats than with cars. She almost ended up in Corsica... Who let her take the boat by herself? Me. I'm sorry. I missed your screening. It was not your fault. You forgive too much. I hear that even the critics liked it. Heh. Yes. Imagine at my age to start a career as a serious filmmaker. For me, you have no age. ( chuckles ) I look that funny? Pretty funny. You know, you look great. I wish to apologize to you. What for? For what I made you say. That I'm more important than your film. You didn't make me say it. I said because I meant it. You are more important. I'll put it in writing. I'll burn the negative. You are a bad liar. A fool and stupid and selfish. Yes, all of that. And in love with you. Yes. It's your nature. I love you too. We are both full of love. But I need someone who feels I'm more important than anything. It's my nature. Next time you will come here with another film, it will be in the competition and everyone will like it. Will you like it? Probably not, but it will not matter. It will to me. A little. You're always telling me how I feel, you know that? Perhaps because you always look in the wrong direction. ( chuckles ) ( chuckles ) Maria, I've never met anyone like you. Now you have. ( tender theme playing ) It's been some week, huh? A week? Is that all? Christ, what am I gonna do now? Cheer up, may man. Into every life, some sun must shine. Feast your eyes upon this. What is it? A contract from Duke Shoot to Pick Pack, Sir Walter Nigger and Shoot Me Before I Kill Again. He hasn't even seen it. Man, you never learn. It's not the film that counts, it's the deal. Now, you will notice we are partners 60-40. HAL: Well, that's not fair. I don't deserve more than you. ANDREW: You ain't getting it. HAL: That's not fair either. You don't deserve 60. ANDREW: Well, just think of it as making up for 200 years of slavery. Now, my idea is you start right away. ( majestic theme playing )
