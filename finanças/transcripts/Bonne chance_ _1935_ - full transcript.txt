Good luck! Good luck! Maurice Lehmann and Fernand Rivers present to you... or more exactly, wish you... Good luck! A film especially conceived and written for the screen by Sacha Guitry And this film was made under the direction of Fernand Rivers Is the likeness starting to come along? Yes, it's starting. By the way, don't make my hair as long as it is. Why not? - Because I'll get it cut tomorrow. - Fine, fine. Are you also going to have the button that's missing from your vest sown back on? - Yes. Then I'll add it to your portrait. May I move? - Oh, no, especially not now, when I've just discovered the curve of the eyebrows. I would have liked to scratch my nose. You can scratch your nose, you're not at a photographer's studio. Just stay there where you are. Is that your wife there? She's charming. You don't know mine? - No. She's frightful. She had erysipelas two years ago. She's ugly. Well, as long as she's charming... But she isn't. My poor little one, I'd forgotten about you. Good day, sir. - Good day, miss. Do you have gloves for sale? - Certainly, sir. Listen, frankly, well, I find it terrific! - That's fine, that's fine... I declare, I'll take it with me right away. Good. We agreed on a price... 70 francs... But I'm so happy with it that... Here. Give me 20 francs instead of 30. Are you all right? - You're asking about my health? No, the price. - Yes. Are you finished, you little fashion plate? Mom, admit that it suits me. Maybe later you'll have others just as pretty. I'm not counting on it, but I certainly hope so. But you have very moist hands, sir. That's emotion, miss. - Oh? - Yes. If it's just for a marriage proposal, we can lend them to you. Oh?! - Yes. 5 francs instead of 17. Excuse me, sir, can you cut my hair exactly as in my portrait? Why, yes, sir, I think so. - Good. See you later, mom. - See you later, dear! Good day, miss. - Good day, sir. Good luck! - Thank you. You're paying close attention now? Yes, sir. Indeed, sir. Yes... In any case, I'll tell you when it's short enough. Very well, sir. Last day. National Lottery Oh, already! Miss Marie is not home, madam? - No, Mr. Prosper. But come in! Come in, come in, please. And sit down. She's just gone on an errand, She certainly won't be gone long. Are you sure that in 20 minutes I can be at the Gare du Nord? At this hour, madame, surely. If it were around noon, I would say no. Then let's not waste a second! Come in! Oh, my laundry, I'd forgotten. Oh, too bad, it's too late. The luggage is all closed. How much do I owe you? - 91 francs, madam. 91? Listen, I only have 72 francs. But because you have pretty eyes, I'll give you the linen, too, and I believe you won't be taking a loss. Good luck! Good luck! Sir, I'd like a ticket for the ninth drawing. Sir! I'd like a ticket for the ninth drawing. Excuse me, sir. I'd like a ticket for the ninth drawing. It is my duty, miss, to inform you that in 1924, my wife ran off with a captain of the colonial infantry, and that as a result of that incident, I have become very hard of hearing. Would you mind repeating your question, please. I'd like a ticket for the ninth draw! - Аh! Just one! If you wanted two, you would get only one just the same. Really, why? - Because it's the last one. No! - Yes. And when is the drawing? Tonight at 9:00, at the Trocadero. Goodness, I'm just in time. - You may say so! - Goodbye, sir. Poor thing. She's very hard of hearing, too. Admirable... And, out of curiosity, you're asking for it...? I value it at 32,000. Hm, hm, hm... me, I find it beyond value. It speaks, doesn't it... - Yes, don't interrupt it. What grace, what force, and what facture (= workmanship)! Yes, the facture (= bill) is the only thing that separates us. Well, sir, it's a masterpiece, and I hope you don't sell it. - No? Because I intend to pay it these little visits from time to time. Goodbye, sir. Thank you for your courtesy. But what's the matter, do your teeth hurt? No, madam, my gloves. - Your gloves? I mean, my hands. My gloves are hurting me. Then take them off. - But I can't, madam. I don't know what kind of powder the salesgirl put inside them, but it's agglomerated with my sweat, and now it's like a kind of mortar. Well, then, here... - No, no, no... Hello, Mr. Prosper! Oh, excuse me... It's nothing, nothing. It's only more happiness. I would like to talk to you, Miss Marie. Really? - Yes. Well, then, Mr. Prosper... I'll leave you. - And I'll listen to you. No... No, don't listen to me! I can't go on, I'll go look for another pair. Another pair? Good evening, miss. - Good evening, sir. Sir! - Мiss? I want to tell you something. - Now that's a very good idea. You don't know what I'm going to tell you. No, but it's already a good idea to want to tell me something. A little while ago, when I went out... - Yes... - We passed each other. Absolutely. - I said hello to you, and you shouted to me, "Good luck!" Why? - Why what? Why did you say "good luck"? - Did it bother you? On the contrary, it surprised me, and, if you can believe it, it brought me luck. Well, if you can believe it, I'm not at all surprised. It's happened to me before several times. Yes, I don't have much luck myself, but I bring good fortune to others, when I want to bring them good fortune... when I find them... very agreeable. And you find me very agreeable? Yes, let's put it that way. Then I brought you good fortune? - Yes! And since I'm superstitious... It's made such an impression on me that I beg you not to refuse what I will ask. It's hard for me to see myself refusing you something. Can you believe that I've just bought a ticket for the ninth drawing. You don't say! When? - Just now. In the little bank on the corner of rue Albert Willemetz. Well, well, well... So, what is it? Since you've already brought me luck, I've come to ask you to accept half of it. Half of what? - My ticket. If I win! You mean that we buy it together? - No, no, no, no... Only if I win. I mean, if we win. I can't agree with that. - Oh, you must agree. You mustn't argue with superstitious people. If the number doesn't come up, I lose. If it comes up, we win, and let's say it's one thousand francs, I'll give you five hundred. Please don't refuse. Well, give me a minute. A minute? - Yes, a minute, and I'll come back. What you're doing is foolish. But I enjoy doing it. Then let me. I'm sure if he accepts, I may win... ten thousand francs. And you'll only get five. Well, I like that better than nothing at all. Well? - I accept! What did you go to do? I went to ask at the bank how many tickets were sold in the last couple of hours. I was told: one. The last one! Yours. Therefore, mine. - What do you mean, yours? Yes! Can you believe that a little while ago I almost went into that bank to buy a ticket. That's the one I would have had. Do you want it? - Oh, no. I only want half of it now. Be nice and allow me... - Don't insist! Let's not talk about it any more. So, I'll tell you the number. - Now it's my turn to say no. If you win, I want you to be able not to keep your promise. I'm joking. But really, let's say we win. I don't want to hear it from anyone else but you. Ah... charming! Life is good, no? It's good to be on Earth. Then let's continue. When's the drawing? But it's tonight. - No! You're not going to go? - Oh, no! You have to wait for luck while lying in bed. - Exactly. Then, in unison, let's say to each other-- Good luck! And good night. See you tomorrow... Now I can breathe... Ah, there you are! What happened to you just now? I went to choose a bigger pair of gloves, and now, hear me out! You are welcome to stay, madam. For weeks and weeks, I would even say months, I came to visit you, I've brought you flowers... I've taken you to the movies... And once you were even kind enough to have a drink with me at the Rotunda. I plead guilty! You must have thought there must be something behind such assiduity. It's impossible to doubt it, you're too sensitive. Then I won't beat around the bush: Miss Marie, I love you. I'm 23 years old. I make twelve hundred francs a month,... I hope one day to get twice that, and I have the honor of asking for your hand. But how kind it is, Mr. Prosper, what you've just said to me! Do you agree? - That is to say... listen, I'm going to ask you for two or three days to think about it. You can't refuse me three days! - And yet, I do refuse. I refuse because, you see, tonight I have to go to Quimperlé-- Excuse me! -- to do thirteen days of military service, And I won't leave here without your answer: It's been two weeks since I've I've made this decision... and I deliberately waited the last day. I told myself, if she says yes, I'll endure with joy my thirteen days at Quimperlé, and if she says no, well, I'll be away from her for thirteen days, and I'll get over it more easily there than here. How do you find me? - I find you very nice, Mr. Prosper. Do you like the shape of my skull? - Why, yes... It's unique! - I don't doubt it. Then don't say no. - I don't say no. So say yes! Consult your mother! Oh, Mom, I know her! It's her dream to see me married. It's the dream of all mothers. We could get married either in Paris or in my hometown, I'm from Avranches... Or in your hometown; I know you're from Provence. Yes, I'm from Fontenac. That would be a nice place to get married. We would do it in exactly fourteen days. - In fourteen days? - Yes. As soon as I get back. No? Well? - Will you say yes! Oh, you're funny, the two of you. Let me have time to think! When are you leaving? - This evening at 9:03, But I can also take the 12:30 train. Listen, listen, Marie... Yes, Mom. He's nice, come on! - Yes, Mom, yes. Me, it's not a nice man that I'd like to marry. Then who would you like to marry? I don't know... - Don't make like a child! But that's what I'll be risking! You don't mean to tell me you prefer that painter you chat with. I didn't say that. - That's good, anyway. A man more than twice your age. - Why do you talk about him? Do I? Tell me, what's Prosper's situation? He makes twelve hundred francs a month. That's more than twelve thousand francs a year. That's wonderful, don't you think? You should have seen your eyes just now. You should talk about your own eyes; They make me tremble, when I see you go out with those eyes. I can't very well leave them at home, Mom! Miss Marie, would you like me to come back at 11:45, before I take my train? That will give you six hours to consider it. What do you say? Will you give me answer at 11:45? No! Now! I've decided, I say yes. It's a deal. Your proposition touches me infinitely, but I have the impression there's been a mistake regarding the person. You don't recognize me, Ferdinand? Have I changed so much? What keeps me from recognizing you, isn't you, but me. Because my name isn't Ferdinand. No? - No. You're not angry about my mistake? - Not at all, mademoiselle. Take care. What do you say? Two handsome boys and a girl? Yes, but not now, later. We'll see. So, see you in 13 days. Don't you want to spend the evening together? No, not tonight. I'm very tired. See you soon! - I leave, in happiness. I'm glad. Will you let the mayor of Fontenac know? The mayor of Fontenac? Let him know about what? About our wedding. - Oh, yes. Eight days before the announcement, right? Understood. I'll take care of it. If we're to be married on the 28th, they must be notified by the 19th at the latest. They will be. See you soon. How serious she is. The wife of my dreams. I see her putting my things in order, making dinner, spoiling the children... Yes, that's how I see her. He's got great eyesight! I'm going to bed. Good night, Mom. Good night, my little girl. I want so much for you to be happy. Yes, me too. You'll remember to close the shutters in the shop? Yes, I'll go do it. Sir! - Madam? I have some good news for you! - Really? My daughter's getting married. - You don't say? - Yes! Probably she's marrying that young man I saw before, whose gloves were too small. That's him. He's going away tonight for 13 days, and in two weeks they'll be married. Perfect. Isn't it? Good night, sir! How stupid parents can be sometimes. Oh, no! At least let me sleep! Come in! Excuse me... I can't hear you. We won. We won? - Yes! - No! And what did we win? Oh, a suitcase! No, the grand prize. Yes, two million! Two million! - Oh, it's not true! It is. Here's yours. - Mine? Of course. I took mine straight to a bank. Do what you like with yours. You don't think I'd accept a million from you? Oh, no! You'd better accept it! If you don't want it, just give it to a poor person. But I swear I won't take it back. Please take it away immediately. Not for a million, not for all the gold in the world. No! I was already superstitious before I met you, but since the day you said "Good luck" to me, I've become even more so-- And if you refuse to take what I owe you, I swear it will bring me bad luck. All I can accept from you is half. Half a million? No, half of the ticket, 50 francs. I'll happily give you 50 francs, but I won't accept a million-- Unless... - Unless what? Unless we spend it together, both of us. That would be magnificent, It would be delightful. - Yes, but unfortunately... I know. - No, you don't. I know that you're engaged to be married. How do you know? Your mother was only too pleased to inform me. Because she believed... I really don't know why - that I find you pretty and that I'm about to start courting you. I also know that your fiancé has gone for 13 days. As for me, you don't know me, but I don't need much more than 13 days... to spend a million. Oh, it would be be delightful! And since you're marrying someone other than me, it would be rather charming to see us take your honeymoon together. Yes, the cart before the horse, The wedding journey before the wedding. We'll take our own 13 days, ourselves. I'll turn you around, just wait. We'll make a list of all the things we want to do, see, or see again. We'll fulfill our dreams, and in 13 days... I'll take you to City Hall... I mean, to the door of City Hall... and say goodbye to you, wishing you "good luck." I'll have spent my million, and I already have the impression that it will be the most marvelous memory of my whole existence. Naturally you'll travel under my name! Brothers and sisters always have the same last name, you'll take this trip as if you were my little sister. But if we want to do it, we can't waste a minute. We must leave tomorrow morning. But to do that, we must meet this evening at 10:00 and have dinner together to plan for our trip. So, listen, I'll meet you at 6:00-- Let's say 5:30. Let's say 5:00. It'll be a long wait until 5:00 without seeing each other-- I'm speaking for myself-- So let's say 5:00 by the elephants! What elephants? - The ones at the Acclimation. I choose elephants rather than hummingbirds because they're easier to see from far away. See you later! - See you later. Excuse me, is the count correct? - Yes. Because I don't like to make a mistake. - Oh! - What? My 50 francs? - I don't have any change. Tonight, then? - By all means! I must-- I must tell you, someday, the dream I had last night. - Yes, me, too. Оh, you killer. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Miss, miss-- would you be so kind as to stick out the tongue? No, not yours, mine. The tongue of my shoe. That's it. You're very kind. Thank you, miss. In any case, the Louis XV style suits you. Yes, clearly this is the one that suits me the best. But I find it a little conspicuous. Are you dry, mademoiselle? - What?! Are you dry? - No, not yet! What are those big animals? These big animals, little boy, are gasoline pumps. Oh! - Yes. Oh, it's you! - Yes, it's me. You're the one who was looking at me like that. It's shameful: You have a date with me and you're looking at another woman! Yes, but this other woman, it's you. - But you didn't know that. Disgraceful. I agree. But it's not my fault if you're better than you are. I wasn't looking at you. That just proves that I'm not as good as me. And anyway... since when do sisters make jealous scenes over their older brother? That's right, I'd forgotten about that. If I was able to make you forget it, that's fine. Let's go out. Even though we're outside, we should go out all the same. You won't get tired if we go the long way? No. Do you have a private table outside? - Just one left, sir. In that case you have no more. Excuse me. Excuse me. How charming to see a man no longer young with a very young woman, isn't it? - Why do you say that? Thank you. Excuse me. Oh, they're young people, that's not interesting. Let's go! Finally, a vacant room, Let's go in. Maitre d', give me your menu. But what's inside your suitcase? You'll know soon. Let's concern ourselves with important matters. Thank you. Do you see what's happening to me? What's happening to you? What's happening? I'm reading without my glasses. It's true, I noticed that you weren't wearing them anymore. I don't know. It's out of vanity that I'm not wearing them. One can always not wear them, but what's extraordinary is to be able to do without them. It's to you that I owe that. It's true. I've been feeling transformed for several hours. Perhaps it's not yet noticeable, but if you were to climb down a little silk ladder into my heart, you would see that it's the same age as you. All the more reason not to die of hunger. So, my friend-- Let's take a vote. Caviar! Caviar. - Fine. Soup? Sole? No, no sole. Whiting? No. Flounder? No. Grilled red mullet? No. Blued trout? Yes, blued trout! - Two blue trout. Good. Next, roasted chicken? Yes, my sweet. - Then, sweet-- I mean roasted chicken. And for dessert? - I don't know. Would you prefer a tart or a soufflé? A soufflé. - Vanilla? For little girls. - Lemon? - For little boys. Chocolate? - For dads. - Upon reflection, I prefer a tart. Very good, madam. Straw or cherry? I mean, berry or strawcherry? - Say it softly. Cherry or cherry? Strawberry. - Very well, madam. To drink? - Already? It seemed a little premature. Champagne? - Yes! Champagne, champagne, let's see... Dry? Very dry! - Extremely dry champagne. Here, give us this one. - Good. Very good? - Very, very good. Good. And now, close your eyes. You may relax. We're used to it. I'm not talking to you. - Pardon me. Close your eyes. I know, it's a crime-- eyes like these should stay open on Sundays and holidays-- but please close your eyes. You promise? - I promise. I swear. You know that the good lord sees you, right? You mustn't laugh. Can I open them now? - No. It's absolutely forbidden! And now? - Shh! Not yet. Can I open them? - Yes. Oh, how lovely! What's that? - It's a Renoir. A ravishing Renoir. Are you giving it to me? - Oh, no, sorry, but it's for me. We'll have dinner together, all three of us. It's the dream of my life to have a little Renoir. It's one of the crazy things I've done sometimes, not that I've only done crazy things. When I have to, I know how to behave. You'll have the proof when you will be so kind as to lift up your napkin. My napkin? - Yes, yes, yes... A box! Yes, a little empty box, for your hairpins or your sewing thread. For an empty box, it seems quite heavy. Maybe the clerk has given us a surprise? Or played a joke on us. - That would be strange. He's played a joke. Though generally I don't like jokes, I like this one infinitely. Oh, how beautiful. Thank you! No, no, no! Don't thank me, good heavens. If you knew how pleasant it is to give gifts with other people's money. Tell me it's not such a bad choice. It's extraordinary! I thought it was pretty. May I? You know, at the neighboring tables, I think they kiss each other for much less than that. And in exactly 15 days, I'm getting married-- and I'll put a ring on her finger. Yes, my friend! Why are you eating so fast? And who's going to do the itinerary? Excuse me. I'm thinking this: Japan, there's always Japan. Then there's India... the Acropolis... Egypt... No, the periods of military service aren't long enough. Oh, my God, how long it is, thirteen days! And your fiancée, what's she like? A young girl of very high social position, educated, intelligent, and very pretty, too. A wife like that could do what she wanted with me. Never let women boss you around. A wife is for keeping the house, looking after the children... and obeying her husband! Obey me! Eat this tart. It's delicious. When do I have time to eat tarts? I'm devouring my maps. So, you understand, we're going tonight. with the idea in mind that we have 13 days and a million. So, in 13 days, we need to consume the million. Probably less than that now. It has shrunk by... - I'm not asking for an accounting. But I want to give you one. Here, we've reduced it by 225,800 francs. Already! - Already! She's wonderful! The car, underwear, clothes, the little Renoir. The little Renoir, how much? - Thirty-two thousand. But that doesn't add up to 225,800 francs. No, but there's the... - That's true. You'd forgotten it already. - No, but since it was a gift... You thought that the jeweler gave it to me? Then we're saying 225,800 francs. Exactly. 225,800 francs, subtracted from a million, gives us exactly... 774,200 francs, which I divide by 12, because one day has already passed... Six times... four times... five times... once... zero times... Yes, that's right. So we have 64,510 francs to spend each day, multiplied by 365 What, what? - Let me do this, I know what I'm doing. That gives us zero, five, five... Which gives us exactly 23,546,150 francs in rent... Do you realize? 23 million in rent? For 12 days, we will be among the richest individuals in the world. So, have you made the list of things you want to see or see again? To tell the truth, there are only two things I want. What are they? To revisit the village where I was born, and to get to know Venice. - Fine. Let's say: "Revisit the village where she was born." What is this village, where is it, this village where were you born? It's 11 kilometers from Arles, between Salingres and Fumade, and it's called Fontenac. What are you laughing at? - The accent that came back to you when talking about your natal village. And you were born--? - The date? No, I wouldn't permit myself that. The address. 15 rue Vieux-Marché. - 15 rue Vieux-Marché. Why are you writing all that? - I have an idea. As for your second desire, to see Venice, you'll permit me, I think, not to take it into account. Why? - Because Venice is a place where one goes to do something that we're not going to do on our trip. Something that we're not going to do? - Alas. And why won't we do it? Because you're my sister, and I don't like to do that with my close relatives. Then, let's say, the first stage is Fontenac. But you? - Me? - What are the things you want to do? There's really only one thing I want to do. What? See Venice. Waiter! Sir? Oh, no, don't touch my maps! Give me the cards! - All right, sir. - Let's play belote. Here's what I propose. Listen carefully. Tonight we'll sleep at Fontainebleau; tomorrow, we're in Stresa; Friday around four o'clock, we're in Fontenac. We will pay tribute to the house of your birth; Saturday, after crossing the Alps, we'll pass through Milan, Florence, and Rome, shouting with joy and admiration. Monday, we embark at Brindisi for Egypt. This is the ship that will take us, and these, if you'll accept them as such, are waves. We stay in Cairo for three days. We return by plane. We'll be in Monaco on the 27th And on the 28th, once again in Fontenac, where, in front of City Hall, I will give you my farewell. - That's frightening! Frightening, but it can be done. The proof is that we're going to do it. Let's go! I think so. - By the way, how was that first night? The best. I had a wonderful bed. Miss, here is a letter I entrust to you; please be good enough to send it registered. The mayor of... ? What are you saying? - I can't read your handwriting! - The mayor of... - Fontenac. - Ah, Fontenac! Bouches du Rhône? - Exactly. 1 franc 75. - Why deprive oneself? I don't believe it! Pinède! Pinède! - Mr. Mayor? My friend, read this letter I just received. 50,000 francs? Here's the check! And we have to do what this gentleman asks? Of course we have to do it. Only there's no time to lose. Bring me the marble worker, the orchestra conductor, Everyone we hire for July 14th, It's very simple. In what house was she born, that little one? I don't remember. I'll tell you right away. 50,000 francs! What a stroke of luck! Welcome to our benefactress! What's that? - I have no idea. I think we picked the wrong day. - Too bad. Let's go. In this house was born Marie Muscat, benefactress of Fontenac This poor testimony of our gratitude - is a certain pledge of the profound feelings of your fellow countrymen. I speak for them with great emotion. You have given to your natal village a magnificent gift. Marie Muscat, in the name of of the town of Fontenac... Allow me to kiss you on both cheeks. Gladly. Long live Mr. Mayor! Let us sing and let us wish That the happiness of our benefactress lasts for as many happy days as there are stars in her eyes! Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Mayor! It's I who thank you, my dear little one at whose birth I was present. Mr. Mayor, what's going to happen now? There will be a reception, and then it's finished. Now, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to speak with you for five minutes. I am at your disposal. Come into my office. Come in, sir, come in. Please sit down. I'm at your disposal. What can I do for you? Well, Mr. Mayor, I'm going to get married on the 28th of this month. My most sincere congratulations to you both! And, you see, I want to do it in Fontenac. What an honor for the town! That's very nice. And since I know you need at least eight days' notice, I give you notice. - We'll note it right away. Hey, Pinède! Let me introduce the clerk of City Hall. Miss, sir, I'm delighted. Sir, please permit me to ask your name and occupation. In fact, Mr. Mayor... Can you leave us for five minutes? Step into my office, sir. You're not mad at me? - No, it's quite normal. Sir, please take a seat. - Thank you, sir. Poor child. She's embarrassed to speak of it in front of you, because of her father. Because of her father? - She doesn't have one. What do you mean, she doesn't have one? - No, the poor little one. She was born of an unknown father-- and she doesn't want you to know, which is quite understandable. Well, well, and she has never been acknowledged by anyone? Of course not! Who would acknowledge her, when her father hasn't? Yes... Tell me, is it difficult to acknowledge someone? I don't mean in the street, but in that way? No, it's not difficult. Some formalities to complete. So I think, yes. Tell me, Is it obligatory to inform the person whom one recognizes? If need be, the person doesn't have to be informed, but I don't see what the point of that would be. You're reading this poster? - No. You would do well to read it. That's quite a story. There's a castle that is worth more than 4 million that will go up for sale next Thursday for 300,000 francs, and which won't find a buyer. Do you hear what I'm saying? - I hear very well, sir. And all furnished. You can sleep there tonight. With whom? - With anyone one wants! Here are the photos. Oh, it's magnificent! Oh, yes. Yes, perhaps it would be madness to buy it, But it's a crime to sell it. - Madness? But it's a property, sir, that brings more than 35,000 francs a year. Tell me, does the little one know it, this castle? I certainly think she knows it. Who doesn't know it? It's the local castle, after all. Don't ask me to do things that are too illegal, that's all I ask of your kindness. But I'm willing to wait until the last day, I promise. Reflect, take your time. As soon as you decide, just let me know; as long as I have an hour in advance, it's enough. How kind you are, Mr. Mayor. Oh, I'm not mean, that's certainly true. I make the check out in the name of the notary. - Perfect. Only... - Have no fear. No one in the world will know. - Hide them. I give you back your freedom. Ah, you would do better to put it in chains. Tell me, Marie-- - What, Claude? Look carefully at the road now. When I drive no faster than this, doesn't it give you the impression of being at the movies? Yes, that's right. And do you know how the movie people go about doing that? - No. Well, apparently they just put their camera in the car. Can it be? - It seems so. But, the words that you hear? I'm told they're recorded later in the studio. That's hard to believe. To tell you the truth, I didn't believe it. At 13 degrees north latitude and 25 degrees west longitude. I just got hit in the head with a golf ball - Alain Gerbault. Is there anything you need? - No, why? I hear you moving around in your room. I couldn't find the morning papers. Maybe they're in my room. - No, here they are, I found them. Fine. - Aren't you in bed yet? Not yet, I'm smoking a last cigarette. Oh, no, don't come in. Do you want a newspaper? - No, I beg you, don't come in. What? I kindly offer you a newspaper, and that's the way you receive me? Listen to me well: If this trip continues another two days, your fiancé will suffer a misfortune. Don't you have that impression? - But I do. And I was wondering if you had it, too. It's terrible what is happening to us, And we should never have told each other the dreams we had the night before we left. Most of all we should never have left together. That was madness; we were playing with fire. The day we realized there's nothing in the world more beautiful than a sunset over any countryside at all, we should have been careful. Why is a sunset so dangerous? Because he seems to say to everyone: "I'm going to bed. What about you?" So what are we going to do? What we're going to do... I think we should say goodbye. Оh! - Yes, yes. Yes, bravely. - That's right. Why? Because we're good people. Because we don't want to hurt anyone. - Right. We don't do it with a light heart-- No-- But we're thinking that sometimes in life there are moments when it's better to listen to reason than to one's heart. - Exactly. We're going to say goodbye. We're going to say goodbye this very moment, Yes, this very moment, and tomorrow morning, when you wake up, I'll be far away. What, you're leaving? - At dawn. Oh, don't stay in my presence one more second, please. Goodbye, my little Marie. The memory I will keep of you will be... indelible. Goodbye, Claude. Be happy. Kiss me. Good luck! Claude! Claude! - What's wrong? Mom is not feeling well. You've got to take me back to Paris at once. Yes, my little one, yes, don't worry, It's not alarming, her telegram. Yes, but... - I understand, it's your mom. Sit down and be calm, my precious child. Her telegram, what time was it sent? At 11 o'clock last night. - At 11 o'clock last night. What is it? - You cut yourself. - Yes, I cut myself shaving. What is it? Don't come in. - Telegram for the lady. Be calm. -- Thank you very much. Claude, Claude... - No, don't get excited. Wait. It was indigestion. "It was indigestion. I'm better this morning. Love, Mom." What a blessing! - She's all right. It's over. But you know that what just happened is very important? - Yes? Judge for yourself: last night at 11:00 we separate; your mother gets sick. This morning you throw yourself into my arms, Your mother is all right. Just now, I cut myself shaving, you were apart from me; you are here close to me; am I still bleeding? - Not at all. You see! And in these conditions, I wonder if it's not unwise, mad, to separate? One must be reasonable in life. At any rate, one mustn't be stupid. We can still live together for six days, as we made a commitment to do before the eyes of fate, and this incredible luck that follows us when we are together, and which abandons us as soon as we separate, we should use it all up. - I agree with your opinion. Then let's get dressed. In ten minutes, we'll leave, and until then, I know what I have to do. - Me, too. Dear Mr. Mayor... Dear Mr. Mayor... You know, this is the first time I've ever been on a ship? - No! No, no, no, no! That's not possible! I would like to please them, but with the best will in the world, that isn't possible! They have to choose: it will be either one or the other, and, given what's she's done for the town, I won't hesitate to ignore his request. Say, don't you think these people are a little crazy? No, they're having fun playing jokes, making surprises. I think simply they are people who are happy, which always gives people who are not the impression of being crazy. It's just that, what he asks is impossible, given what she is asking. What's troublesome about boats is that the asparagus sauce never stays where you put it. Much better than asparagus, no? Leeks! - Yes... Don't move! Thank you. Can't you hear me? I'm saying: today is the 24th, it's 2:30, and since a moment ago, you've been the owner of Fontenac Castle. - Thank you! So which do you prefer? You have to choose. So which one, this one or that one? I think I prefer this one. So, how do you like this room? It hasn't been so great. Sir, would you please give me 12,300... I'll keep 40 francs for the cloakroom. You don't like gambling? - No, it's too dangerous! Dangerous? Did I lose? - You didn't win. No, but I almost won. - No, you almost lost. Oh, hello, what a surprise! - How are you? And you? - Very well, thank you. I'm happy to see you. I didn't know you were at Monte Carlo. - Here I am. So we'll have dinner together tonight? - Well, dinner together, that's... Oh, you're not alone? - Not entirely. So introduce us. - Yes! Well, let me introduce my sister. No, your sister? - I'll explain. Goodbye! Thank you. - Sir, your 12,300 francs. But why did he make that face when you told him I was your sister? Because he's my brother, you see. So, the thought that I could have a sister, without ever having told him about it, seemed somewhat extraordinary to him, and you have to admit... Your brother doesn't look much like you. To start with, he's 20 years younger than me, and furthermore we don't have the same mother. No? - No. I don't even believe we have the same father, for that matter. Oh, a foxtrot? You'll excuse us? What does your brother do? My brother? He's a doctor. And he can leave Paris just like that? He didn't leave Paris; he's a doctor in Monaco. You look preoccupied. - Ah, preoccupied! You're incredible! Preoccupied! This is our last day, do you expect me to be cheerful? You'd do better to fold your napkin in fourths. Why? - Because I ask you to. Now put it on your plate. And now look at the beautiful lady over there in a white dress. Do you see the beautiful lady? - Yes. Good. Now, look under your napkin. Oh! What for? What for? To put on your arm, of course. It's wonderful! - You're giving it back to me? No, it's so that you can put it on me yourself. There. It's a parting gift. Claude. - My little one. Do you want to do something that will make me happy? - If I can. Dance a waltz with me. Oh, I can see myself! Thank you, no. At 14, I danced the polka fairly well, but I haven't developed since. Do you like it? - A waltz? I love it! Oh, lord. Well, dance with Gaston. It won't annoy him? - Annoy him? He'll go mad with joy. Gaston! - Claude? - Come over here. Listen, here is a young person who would like to dance a waltz. Oh, that's a great idea! Excuse me for a second, children. How long does a waltz last? It lasts three minutes. - Why? I'd like to know how much one can lose at roulette during the time of a waltz. Oh, no! - Yes. it's necessary. Why is it necessary? - Because I say so. You'll find out soon. Go on and dance. Eight to the bank. 250,000 for the bank. Banco. Card! Card, sir. - Nine to the bank. The maximum on 17 and 50 thousand on each corner of 17. The maximum on 17 and 50 thousand on each corner of 17. No more bets. No more bets, gentlemen. First, red, odd and manque. Transversale. Oh! - What's wrong? I twisted my ankle, and it hurts! Sit down! - What's happened to her? - She twisted her ankle. Hurry and sit down. - No! I think it's better to let the blood flow. I don't think so. - I'm sure! But I am a doctor, miss. It's just that I'm worried. I beg your pardon. Goodbye, madam. Red, even, color. It's not good what you're doing here! - No, it's not good. And it's also stupid. Oh, no! - Wait just a second. Excuse me! Fifty thousand on the second table. You said three minutes! Then you should have come in three minutes. What's the matter with you? Are you limping? I twisted my ankle dancing. Well done! - It's nice, what you're saying to me! Very nice, extremely nice. You shouldn't have danced. Come and have a half-bottle of Evian. Is it good for sprains? - No, after you lose, you die of thirst. Let's go. Is it bad? - Yes. It hurts. Shall we stand there or there? - There. There you go. Is your ankle swollen? - I hope not. I'll tell you if it's swollen. No, it's not swollen. A half-bottle of Evian and two glasses. Why do you play like this? - To lose! Lose? - Yes, lose! With the hope of winning, of course, all the same! Because I swore I would spend my million in thirteen days, because despite the ring and the little Renoir, Despite the car, the bracelet, the castle, despite all that, I still had 117,000 francs left! And now? - Now, I have nothing left. That's why I'm angry... and satisfied. I forbid you to put yourself in such a state. You don't have the right! - I don't have... - No. I forbid you. Let's go to bed! - Together? - Oh! - I'm sorry. How much do I owe you? - Fifteen francs, sir. Fifteen francs. You're happy with that? - Entirely. There's twenty francs. You know, you have to be absolutely abandoned by men and gods to enter a place like this! My God! better throw your money out the window; at least then the poor would benefit. Come, lean on your crutch of old age. No. - Why? Are you angry? No, I'm not angry. I'm all better. No! - Yes. It's not true. - Already it doesn't hurt at all. Then I'll take off my glasses. Sir! What's the matter? - Your money! - I have no more money, sir. You win! - Me? - Yes! How? - You left 50,000 on the second table. And so? So, I put it against the bank twice... but... 500,000 francs! 500,000? This is all for me? Oh, creator of heaven and earth, I bless you! More than 500,000 francs that have returned. You see, it continues, this divine luck that follows us when we are together and abandons us when we are apart. And if luck smiles on us so much when we are only standing side by side, ah, what would it be, if... That's just what I was wondering just now. Really? When? When you did what you did to me, two minutes ago, in the gaming room. My God, what did I do to you in the gaming room? You didn't even notice. No, I danced a waltz with you... Yes, that, I noticed very well. - But before the waltz. Before? What did I do? You grabbed me like this and kissed me on the lips. Oh, it's not true! - Word of honor! What are you saying? Show me how I did it. Like that. Ah? Like this? No, not like that. - No? How? Like this. Ah, I see. Like this? Not as long as that, but like that. Poor Prosper. Let's not worry about that. Rebelote! And ten more! It's crazy how lucky I am now! I hope it lasts. - Yes! Hello, maitre d'? Tea for two, please. Oh, my love! Oh, my God. - What is it? - It's awful! - What's awful? What I did. - Well, what am I supposed to say? No, what we did, it was marvelous. It's what I did all by myself that's awful. Explain... My little Marie, kiss your father. What's gotten into you? - Hold on tight. Better yet, in order not to fall, sit down. Sit down. The day we went to Fontenac, I found out - by accident, I swear! - from that blundering clerk, That your father didn't acknowledge you. - So? So, a crazy idea came to me: I acknowledged you. What? - Yes. - It's not true! - I swear it. But why did you do that? - Why? You know why. Because, since our departure, the sympathy I had for you paled day by day before a feeling of extreme violence. I had to fight it. Furthermore we felt the need to break off our trip, and when we decided to continue it all the same, then, I said to myself that by becoming your father, I would protect us both from the happiness that has just come to us. That's why I did it. But then, this night? I didn't think about it any more, Fortunately. You should have at least told me. I wanted to surprise you on your wedding day. So what are we going to do? We're going to have a little tea. - Yes. But how did you acknowledge me? I acknowledged you... - Just a piece. I acknowledged you with a letter-- I gave you two, because they're tiny-- three days ago, when the feeling you were inspiring in me was becoming all-powerful. Then what must they think of us in Fontenac! Yes, your poor mayor... - And mom doesn't know anything! I'm not talking about your mother, I'm talking about your mayor. - Ah, yes. My God, if only we can arrive in time to cancel my letter. I'd just as soon tell you that... you weren't my daughter after what happened last night. Because you never know, do you? And since I didn't have a child, I'd hate to be a grandfather. Shut up! Poor Prosper... - You can say that again. Oh, it's outrageous! The inconstancy of women! Your wedding is tomorrow, right? Yes, tomorrow morning, at eleven thirty. So, today we must absolutely have lunch in Cannes and spend the night in Marseille, if we want to be in Fontenac tomorrow morning at 11:30. - Obviously. What? I'm sorry. I'm talking with my mouth full. Where are you meeting your fiancé? My fiancé? - Yes. There. - Oh? - Yes. The witnesses, by her request, are the baker and the grocer. Have you told them? Told them? They've been here for half an hour. What time is it? - But it's 11:30! And they're not here yet? - Not in the least. Mr. Mayor? - Pinède? Permit me to tell you, very respectfully, that you are in the process of contributing to a piece of mischief. It's not mischief, it's a joke. The law is no joking matter. Pinède, you distress me. When I hear you say things like that, I sometimes wonder if your grandparents were not from Pas-de-Calais. If we had to take the law seriously, life would quickly become unlivable! Go see if they've arrived! I'm telling you, they're crazy, and they won't be here for a half an hour! Aren't they here yet? Here they are! - Goodbye, little Marie. Goodbye, Claude. You won't come in? To be present at your wedding? No, thank you. And if I asked you? I ask you... And I beg you not to refuse: it will bring me happiness. This is shameful blackmail! Come on. It's terrible, what you're doing to me now. Come on! - Oh! They've just arrived. - I knew they would come. My speech, my speech! Here it is. "Miss..." But where is he? Where is your fiancé? I don't see him. Maybe he hasn't arrived yet. That would be nice! Miss, if you would like to take your place. See you soon. - See you soon. To make me witness this! Really... Miss, let me present your two witnesses. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Stand up! Marie Isabelle Muscat... What is he doing? The bridegroom isn't here! Do you agree to take as your husband... - Yes, Mr. Mayor! But wait until I've said the bridegroom's name! It would be better to wait for the bridegroom to be here! I'll start over. Marie Isabelle Muscat, Do you agree to take as your husband... Claude Gaston Le Pelletier? - What? Yes, yes, Mr. Mayor. Claude Gaston Le Pelletier! Please don't stay there in the back; come here! Marie! My little Marie! So you made fun of me. This is how I get even with you! I regret interrupting your expressions of enthusiasm, But I am forced to, since they are somewhat premature. Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but if I may be permitted to ask... That letter of recognition of paternity? I gave it no notice. Thank you! Because, obviously, I like this better. I should think so. Claude Gaston Le Pelletier, Do you agree to take as your wife Marie Isabelle Muscat? Don't even ask, Mr. Mayor! Forgive me, sir, it's just that I am obliged to ask. Do you agree to take... Oh, do I agree! - You have to say it! - I shout it, sir! You don't have to shout it. You have to say it. - I say it! I say it a thousand times! You only have to say it once! Yes! - Ah! Hey, you there, stop! But hold on, don't go like that, you're not married yet. Marry us quickly! What do you mean, marry you quickly? You run out of here like two rabbits! Two minutes of patience! But no more than that. - Fine. By the powers that are vested in me, you are united before the law. Now I am going to read you a few articles of the code... Oh, no! - Yes. She has to know that a wife should follow her husband everywhere. You don't have to tell me that, Mr. Mayor! That's what I call a wedding! My dream has come true!
