- Do you know you're under oath? - Yes. Are you aware that perjury is a crime? According to this, you are owed six years' vacation. What am I doing here? - Who knows? - Tell me about you. - What? - I don't know, anything. The usual story... - My father left us... - oh, no! How old were you? Thirty-two. You shouldn't joke about those things. It's true. He got divorced and disappeared. Thank you. Real food. Want to come up? No, no. I don't want to, I don't want to. - I don't want to. - What do you mean? I just can't. I'm sorry... I just can't. Don't laugh. Do you know what it takes to get a woman this far? I feel like it, but I don't want to. It's too complicated for a man to understand. I understand everything. - Satisfied with your work? - What do you mean? - Are you tired? - Yes, I woke up at 6 to get here. I can imagine. - When was your last holiday? - A long time ago. Too long. They won't let me go. That's not legal. - Are you nervous? - No. Do you get depressed? Or feel like crying? No. My question makes you laugh. Are you amused by depression? No. - Does it scare you? - No. The tests. You're going to draw here. And answer some questions. On another shee you're going to draw a man, a woman, and a house. My colleague will test you, too. - Why do I have to do this? - Because I need you to. I've been flying for 17 years, and I've never done this. Things change in 17 years. We need an assessment. The sooner you finish, the sooner you can go. To your success. - To yours. - To theirs. - Everything will work out fine. - Cheers! - Any news? - Several. I called you at operations, but you'd already left. The horizons and gyro are all inoperative. - What does the MEL say? - The MEL states: "No night flying without standby horizon." - Hi. - How are you? This plane is inoperative for night flight. We've been flying like this for a week. Not my problem. We can take it to a hangar and cover it up. Whatever. Fix it or give me another one. - I can't fly like this. - No planes. The Golf Foxtrot is grounded in Salta. Well, then I'm very sorry. Tell operations we're no-go. The technical log, please. Operations, one-six-zero. Go ahead. Two horizons and a gyro out of order. We are no-go. Ok, roger. They're not departing 2 horizons... and a gyro out of order. He's such a pain in the ass! Any other pilots around? Stop loading, ...we are not flying with this plane. - Why not? Two horizons are out of order. Is that serious? Julia, once you're done with catering come to operations. I'll see you in operations. Are they crazy? Two horizons don't work. - Are they flying like this? - They're crazy. What the hell are you doing? Rules are one thing, reality another. That's how we fly here. Yes, the place sucks, and the planes are crap. This is madness! What if the only functioning horizon fails? It won't faiI tonight. Hi, this is Perez. You have my support. What happened today was a disgrace. That's all... see you, man. Captain, operations calling. You're grounded for the rest of the month. Who gave the order? Ok, thanks. LAPA chief pilot. I insist on the very serious reports I handed you. With the current state of maintenance, a LAPA aircraft will most likely be involved in an accident. This is not only predictable but also almost inevitable. Hello. This is Gonzalo. I'd like to meet you today at noon. Well... I'd like to talk to you. Did you know I was suspended? I know. I didn't want it to end up like this. I know how the plane was. I owed them for the simulator. what kind of a favour is it? Cash, man. It makes a big difference. In your financial situation I'd also follow the rules. - I've no choice. - Now they got you. One day it'll be over. We'll fly like a normal company. Did you file a report? - What did you write? - The truth. - Are you submitting it? - I don't know, why? And if you do? - What do you think will happen? - You know best. You tell me. In a normal company, they'd fire me, here they'll fire you. In a normal company we wouldn't be discussing this. In a normal country, we wouldn't be discussing this. - Hello. - Hello. - I've got some letters. - For whom? For Adrian. With copies to everyone. The owner, managers, general director. - They've stolen my computer. - What? Have you got a back-up? Are you ok? I'll check my house. Call you later. - I'm home. - I can see that. We called this informal meeting in order to talk. Only after we threatened with mass resignation to the union. If we cool down, we might be able to talk. What should cool down are the union attacks on the company. What attacks? Punta Cana's flight captain was not defended. He flew without life jackets. What attacks? Who told you? Was it him? It was reported by the cabin crew's union. Anyway, the seats serve as life jackets. Sorry, seems we have a different opinion here. No, they're not. They're flotation aides. It takes a conscious passenger strong enough to grab them. The regulations for flights over 50 miles from the coast... - that's a subtility. - No, it's not. It's a flotation device. It keeps an unconscious passenger out of the water. Only life jackets do this. - That's not true. - Shut up! - No, I won't! - Stop attacking the company! I didn't attack the company! - He's attacking the company! - No, I'm not! And that letter? How can you prove a plane will crash? You have the evidence, the technical logs. Besides, I was asked to fly at night without two horizons. Perez, you were the co-pilot, you remember what happened. Tell us what happened. Yes, it's true, the gyro and horizon were inoperative. But the standby horizon had an inclination due to apron slope. So it was perfectly operative. Like this... we've grounded you, initially for six months. - Why? - You know you're not well. I'm fine but safety is not. What business does the company doctor have here? Let's focus. Writing such an ominous letter, you're describing a fear. Exactly. I'm afraid a plane might crash. - Or do you fear that you will? - No, I'm careful. If the plane isn't safe, I refuse it. - You'll undergo treatment. - Why? What is my diagnosis? You're always running away from your melancholy. What entitles you to talk about my melancholy? You're missing the point, pilots face a dilemma. They either comply with rules and risk their jobs... or they break the rules and compromise safety. As state representatives you should do something. You think our goal is to provide safety? You think it isn't? Do you realize you're very querulous? - What does querulous mean? - Quarrelsome... I'm a complete idiot. We already know that, but please specify. I did just what they wanted me to do. - What did you do? - I argued with the psychiatrist. Oh, well... you definitely are an idiot. Look, they published your article. Look, look. "On april 15, 1912, RMS Titanic went down. 1,515 people lost their lives in the shipwreck. The life boats only had space for 1,178 passengers... of the 2,224 on board. Abandon ship procedures were never practiced. It was the first case of catastrophic industrial pressure. 85 years later, they're investigating if a flight... flying ba-caribbean came back without life jackets without life jacket for the passengers. Despite the time and lives spent, we learn nothing from it." Hey, moron, wake up... answer, dammit, I've good news for you. De Angelis has been fired. - Hello, how are you? - Fine. Have a seat. We'd like to talk to you. Sorry, I didn't introduce you. Ms. Fabbri is our new Pr. manager. We'd like to talk with you about... your conflict with the previous management. They did things in a way that would have led to an accident. I just warned them. We appreciate your concern for safety. And we're already dealing with many of these issues. I'm glad to hear it. If you'd like to work with us, there shouldn't be a problem. In fact, there is one. Although I have my american and english medical, in my last check-up the air force denied me a certificate. That can be arranged. The director of the certifying board is a friend of mine. Well, then there seems to be no problem. There is a favor I'd like to ask you. Yes? It's about the letter you wrote. It went public. And it drew a lot of attention in the aviation community. The NY times quotes you foreseeing a disaster. I didn't know they'd published it. Yes, I happen to have a copy. If anything happens, your letter becomes a time bomb. We can't work under these conditions. If you respect the law, It won't harm you. The letter's for Adrian The public sees us as a company, not as individuals. - Are you asking me to take it back? - Please, don't get me wrong. You should make some changes... so we can work peacefully, - I wouldn't know how to do it. - You're smart enough. That letter is well-written. Think of something. You don't have to answer me now. Take your time, give it some thought... and call me. Very well. - Do you know him? - No. Write something. Some nonsense, anything. I can't help you if you won't let me. If I write that, they'll let me fly again? - I'm sure. - I'm not. Think what it will be like if you can't fly any more. I know it's important to you. I don't want you to quit flying. Neither do I. When I was a kid, I'd stare into the sky for hours. - What did you think about? - Well... I dreamt of the future. How did it turn out? Ok... well, sort of. All this about you and flying is strange. Your grandparents... - all this trouble you've caused. - I didn't cause any trouble. I wonder where it all comes from? I used to live under the airport locator. I looked up and the only thing I saw were planes. When the Austral DC-9 crashed in Fray Bentos... the plane that flew into a storm? - He never flew into a storm! - He did, it was a pilot error. How can you work for an airline and speak of pilot error? Pilots make mistakes, I guess. Of course we make mistakes, but that's not the point. It's the procedures, that's what it's all about. They cost a lot of money. That's what your manager doesn't get. I investigated the crash on behalf of the pilots' union. I was at the crash site for three days. Then I went to Washington, heard the voice recorder. It was the worst thing I ever heard. Both pilots knew they were going to get killed. You know what I found in the crater? Three of the captain's fingers... on the speed brake lever. He died trying to save his plane. Of course, the government and the air force blamed the storm. Was he an idiot that ran into a storm? A suicide? Very convenient, isn't it? Do you know why that plane came down? It didn't have an alarm the air force had regulated as mandatory. See how easy it is to blame it on pilot error? Are you ok? - What now? - Nothing... We'll sell the house, that's all. I'll paint a sign right now. Why don't you retract? You'll never fly again if you don't. They'll just file it. Don't be a fool, he can't do that. You're right. If I had his financial position, I could afford not to retract. You know what, Gordo? Keep drinking beer, that's what you're really good at. I can't do it. - What? - The retraction you asked for. Why not? It's not right... why do you want it so badly? I don't get it. Yes... you hardly understand anything. Don't be arrogant, I want to help. It's not arrogance. We've explained it in so many ways. - We're trying to improve things. - How do you know? Because I'm there. How do you know technicalities are true? Because we supervise. Who? Adrian is still chief pilot. What supervision? - If he lies, we'll notice. - What will you do? Ask me? You're so whimsical. - It's not a whim. - You don't get it. This is not a game. It's a job. And jobs are necessary for a living. Stop, stop. I'm just saying a plane will crash... if you keep this up. I even put it in writing! Please don't do me any more favors. Can't you see... that our childhood is over? I'm not the girl you dreamt with. Flying is not what you thought it would be. You're not the boy in the letter now. Nothing's like you imagined. - But? - I'm fed up! How the hell did I end up here? I can't keep dealing with a guy who ruins everything he touches. You ruin everything! You ruined your marriage, you want to ruin mine. You ruined your pilot dreams. You want to ruin the company. The company is my job. What do you care? You'll get away with it anyway. Get out of the car. Take your letter and go! Congratulations, he's resigned. A few accusations, but hey... good morning, follow me. Good morning. Ready? Let's start. These are 100 technical reports. There were 96 false alarms in four months. How does this affect flight operations? In the case of such degradation of company standards, a pilot is unlikely to react adequately to an alarm. I'm from the company operations. - Where are they? - Everywhere. I need simulator and vacation files, ...and the technical logs of Whisky Romeo Zulu. They may not be here. I'll get them. - Coffee? - No, thank you. Cabin crew, prepare for take-off. On august 31, 1999 a LAPA B737 registered Whisky Romeo Zulu, crossed Costanera ave. And caught fire after a failed attempt to abort take off. 62 passengers were killed, together with the captain, the co-pilot, the purser and two passers by. 33 passengers suffered injuries and burns. On december 2000, a federal court charged the following people with criminal ravagement or failure to comply with the duties of a public officer: LAPA airlines: Owner & president, general director, operations mgr, human resources mgr, former operations mgr, B737 line mgr; the Argentine Air Force: Air regions commander, director of medical certifying board, director of licensing dept. There's a registration over there with the name Whisky Romeo Zulu. I think it's LAPA, not lap... president, there're several deaths. A estimate of 100 people... it's a terrible tragedy. Dr. Olivera has given me some details. We don't know if the plane was landing, or aborted take-off. We still don't know if it was a take-off or a landing... but it ended, as you can see, with these consequences. There is also a list of survivors. As a pilot, I can only think of a simultaneous engine ingestion, due to a flock of birds... are you denying engine problem? I'm not denying anything. We are replacing these planes with new ones, but we have problems with the famous school teachers tax. I'd like to add... that we're also victims. ...ex-pilot for LAPA, who filed a serious denounce... on control and maintenance, one of the hot topics in buenos aires and the whole country what did you report? What did you see? I offered the judge the letters... that I wrote to the LAPA managers in 1996. If company policies were continued, this is not only predictable but also almost inevitable. I noticed the presence of the former LAPA pilot. Secondly, I noticed his disloyalty... to the company that had employed him. He didn't seem to be in a good psycho-physical condition. The pilot was overdue for 27 days. It could prove that he wasn't qualified to fly the plane. Can the air force reassure the flying public? They can feel safe. I consider... the controls performed by the authorities in Argentina... are better than those in any other transport system in any other country. Mr. Deutsch, just a few words. 4 years since the accident. What can you say to the relatives? That I'm very sorry. - There are claims of ravagement. - No. - No ravagement? - I don't think so. Do you think you made a mistake? Any regrets? No, a human error. It happens. The judge doesn't think so. He says the company didn't consider the risk... of not performing adequate maintenance. Maintenance was 100%, better than other airlines'. - Was it all capt. Weigel's fault? - Totally. Why was a pilot selected, who took-off without noticing... an alarm indicating that the flaps had not been activated? We'd picked him before that. Two years with no holidays. Other pilots, six years. That's not true. You're making it all up. - The personnel files prove it. - Have you seen those files? - The judiciary has seen them. - Is that so? Why have you never asked the relatives... if they needed some kind of help? We did. The insurance company paid a lot of money. Is it cheaper to pay insurance than to maintain the planes? Maintenance is 100%. Aren't you listening? I'll say it again. LAPA has been flying for twenty-two years. This was its first crash. Its president, a pioneer, has been crucified. With the money Andy Deutsch received for selling tiastores, he could be in cote d'azur. Sun, beautiful ladies. Instead, he has to deal with journalists who ask: "Are you going to pay the insurance?" We're scaring off pioneers.
