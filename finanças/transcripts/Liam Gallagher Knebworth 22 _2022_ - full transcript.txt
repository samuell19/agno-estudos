This is history part two, mate. So yeah, it's gonna be mega. - As a music fan, you know that you still have Knebworth-- E Street, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Oasis. - Mick Jagger wouldn't be able to do this on his own. Bono wouldn't be able to do this on his own. Fuckin' Robert Plant wouldn't be able to do this on his own. I don't think-- maybe Freddie Mercury might be, but he's not here, is he? - Liam Gallagher, Knebworth, don't understand it, mate, because his voice, it ain't gonna carry at Knebworth. - Yeah, I was a bit skeptical at first when I heard he was doing it. Because it's a ballsy move. He could have nosedived. - I think about that midnight, as it was pinnacle. And this has come off the back of what the fuck is it all about? - It was shit when I didn't have money. And even though I've got a few quid now, I look around and it's still fucking shit. - I guess a show like Knebworth has got all sorts of functions. - Although we've had a shit, weird time, we bring people together. And that's the important thing. - I think it's gonna be 80,000 people in a field at Knebworth absolutely going for it, you know, going mental. - I don't know, I'm obviously lucky, you know what I mean.

It probably saved my life when I been at my lowest. - As a young gay boy, Oasis gave me the opportunity to have that common ground with my male pals at school. - He's always just staying true to his sound. And he's like, "Jog on, mate, you're not gonna affect my life." - I would give Liam credit for one year of sobriety. - We share the same birthday.

But as long as the sun is shining, it'll be great. - Knebworth has this reputation as the home of rock, I suppose. - It's one of those venues that has been around since the '60s. You know, huge iconic status, you know, huge history. - It's one of those that you want to reserve it for either the greatest act or the greatest artist. It's a big deal, playing that gig. You know, it's once in every generation. - The Rolling Stones stayed the weekend when they were here in '76. And the Beach Boys were all here in 1980 eating my brother's birthday cake. To me, it brings Knebworth alive. It's what we're all about. It's now just as much a part of Knebworth's heritage as the fact that Charles Dickens used to come and have dinner, you know, 150 years ago. It's sort of part of what we do. - And it has this sort of aspect of having a type of bowl to it. And the audience is just enormous. But they have enough space. They've all got an incredibly good view of the stage. And you know, the backdrop of the trees and the overall surrounding, coming with that sort of iconic status of Knebworth, it's sort of a perfect location. - So is that where it actually was, then, the last one? Probably, innit? - I believe the stage is in the same place, but they've changed the guest area. - I mean, look at that, all the tents over there. It's fucking massive, innit? Yeah, it's fucking top, man. Look at that. Come on. I've not been in this field since-- since whenever it was. And even then, I can't remember much about it, you know what I mean? I remember coming in on the helicopter thinking, "There's loads of fields here empty. "Surely we could have fucking slung "a few more people in there, made it bigger, you know what I mean? So 125,000, I think it was that time, but I was thinking, being greedy, you know what I mean, like going, "Come on, surely, we should have put a few more people in that field over there and that field over there." But I was happy with it. It was mega. [dramatic music] - From hit-and-run gigs to big sellout stadium shows all across Europe, Oasis have become the success story of the '90s. - You know, I don't think anyone can overestimate how much Oasis and Liam means to anyone in their late 30s, early 40s. They defined an era. And Knebworth in '96 was the moment of that era. - A quarter of a million rock fans are counting the hours till the Gallagher brothers take the stage. - Two million people tried to get tickets for one of the biggest ever open-air concerts in Britain. - Of course, the one thing that no amount of hype can guarantee is the weather. But then for those who truly adore these masters of music, that presumably won't be a problem. - You all right, mum? - In terms of the '90s, we were in a period of optimism. You know, Thatcher had gone. Blair was in. - There was just a bit of promise in the air that anything could happen. Let's spend some money on solving some of the problems in the country. They thought it was the end of history, didn't they, the '90s. And there's been so much more of it. [chuckles] - The music was good. Loads of bands in the '90s that were great. And obviously, there was loads of shit ones as well. - A lot of the bands were a lot more real, especially with stuff like The Stone Roses and things like Creation Records, which obviously Oasis came through. A real do-it-yourself sort of attitude, rather than, um, being made by, like, an industry. - The fashion was-- I don't think it was amazing. But it was decent, you know what I mean, I think it went with the music. - It was light-hearted, having fun. - Love ya. - People together, parties in parks, little mini festivals, concerts. - We definitely did exactly what it said on the tin, you know what I mean? We fucking--we went for it. And we got high. - Thinking about the price of beans in Yugoslavia and all that stuff. - And we had a good time, man. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. - I think it was the last kind of era that you could sort of really get away with stuff. - What do you think is the worst fashion mistake someone's made? Have you seen someone that's so like, ooh, like-- - You. - Oh, you bastard. - Do anything these days and you're fucking stoned to death, aren't you? - I mean, it just so happens Liam was big in the '90s and he's big now. But I think that's where the parallel ends, really. - We've been governed by a single party for 12, 13, 14 years. They've run out of ideas. They've run out of passion for the country, it feels. And I think people are a little lost in terms of the direction of the UK. - We've opted to cut ourselves off from the world, haven't we, and be an insular island and um, it's a shame. - It really leaves people a bit disenfranchised with the whole political system-- or at least I am anyway. - People are searching for reassurance. - People need a release. They need to find that 50 pound in the pocket to go to see a concert, you know, be it 1,000 people, be it 80,000 people. People need to get outside and just be with other people and have fun. - I mean, I talk about it all the time, you know. And people are bored. "You went to Knebworth?" "Yeah, I went to Knebworth." Yeah. But now that's gonna change now. Because people are like at least Knebworth. "Oh, did you go to Knebworth?" "Yeah, I went to--" "Which one? 2022 or '96?" [electric guitar strumming] - I done like two full gigs the other week. And then I've done a bit of rehearsing in the studio. But I try not to rehearse a lot. I just want to be peaking on that stage. - To adapt the show for a big stage, that's what the whole kind of Redditch is for. It's meant to look as close as you can, dimension-wise, to the stage. It's not really a rehearsal for the band. At this point, it's for the million-pound lights to get switched on and video stuff. - See these big cinema? How would you feel if they're like, to come down some. [interposing voices] - How's the no caffeine going? - Very tough. - No caffeine? - She's given up the fucking caffeine. - Oh, aye? - I've enhanced the fucking hashish. - Well, that's a great combination. - So I'm always keen to not play second fiddle. Every time put our foot down and do what we need to do as a band as well. - You know, we're not in Bruce Springsteen's band, so, like, getting into that territory of, like, over an hour and a half is long for us. And so we were doing that basically every day for about-- I don't know--maybe 20 days or something like that. It was a long time. - Keeping your-- your mental strength for the big gig is essential. I think it's maybe half the battle, really. You know, there's that elephant in the room at this point that what your preproduction is for is for Knebworth. You're trying to not be nervous. You're trying to deal with everything in real time. Because there are still issues to iron out. But it's kind of-- it's an unbearable noise at that point. - You just--you know, you worry about whether you're gonna just walk out and your pants fall off or something. But, like, generally, I think, if I'm sat there playing, I'll be all right. Yeah, I could get away with one trouser incident, you know, per set. - Your muscle memory will carry you through.

And it was very similar to the build up to Knebworth, in a way. He's excited and he's raring to go, but he doesn't know how it's gonna go. And if your benchmark for all of this is one of the biggest bands of all time... [chuckles] then you've got to cut yourself some slack, I suppose. And I don't know how much slack he cut himself really. - Let's do a few more, man. - When we done the first album of the solo stuff, it went well.

Another number one record. - And every time we went up a level, things just sold out instantly again. And it never seemed to be a problem stepping up. - I think for Liam, that little time in the wilderness, he was just getting his act together and running all the time, writing songs. And then to get sort of validation, I think, must have been amazing for him. It certainly was for us. Because it was like, "Yes!" - It was Liam's idea to attend Knebworth, 1,000%. - And actually on day one, Debbie was explaining everything we were going to be doing over the summer and he said straight away, "I think we're gonna do Knebworth." And I thought, "Wow." - For him to go toe-to-toe with his former band was-- you know, seemed ridiculous at the time. - We put one night on sale. We had one night scheduled. - He's really in-touch with the fans. So I think he knows that people wanted it and the youth of today wanted it. He knew we'd all be there, the older generation, because like I said, we have to be there. I think it probably took him by surprise that he could sell two nights out. - It's sort of like that point where, you know, surfers hit a wave. We just hit a moment. And it was extraordinary, to be honest. - Imagine shaking up a bottle of champagne and the cork being popped. And I think it's just been a pressurecooker, a need for people to have that release. - He's just the epitome of, like, rock and roll. And rock and roll never dies.

And then I started my record collection. I just want to rock. And I'm a graduate not this year because actually I have my biggest exam on the third and the third is Knebworth. So I'm not in Belgium. [laughs] Like, when you're going to go to a Liam gig, everybody's living, everybody is screaming and dancing. And I really feel like I belong. This is why I don't mind going at my gigs alone. Because I know I'm gonna meet people my age or older or younger. And I can't believe in two days, I'm not going to the toilet just to be front row. Some of my friends, they're like, "Yeah, but you're already going to see Liam, like, five times this summer." I'm like, "You might be missing the best gig of your life because of an exam?" No way. I'm good with my rock and roll. ♪ ♪ [engine rumbling] - What's been going on this past week? It's not just about this show, is it? Something quite big happened in the last few days. - Yeah, I got me hair cut. [both chuckle] All right, no, Man City won the league and the Liver-- and the scousers fucking bottled it. So it was marvelous. All is good, man. - You also put out your third record, as well. - Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, that come out-- when did that come out, Liz? Friday, yeah. Yeah, man, I mean, the album was done in November last year. So it's been a long time, you know what I mean, just sitting about on the shelf. So sometimes I think the longer it's sort of sitting there, you sort of-- you listen to it and you go, "Fucking hell, is this any good or what?" Have we fucking-- have we maybe gone a bit too far in that but-- Oh no, I just think I can't wait to get this fucking out and get on stage and do it, you know. I'm not putting a gun to your fucking head to come and buy our records. I'm certainly not putting a gun to your head to come and fucking interview me. Play it or don't play it. No skin off my nose. The people that buy it and like the fans and all that down in the front, they're the one's with the best ears. And they're the ones that actually you try to impress, not some fucking spotty little herb called fucking Eugene. They've never bought me a nice holiday. Yeah, man, I mean, it's not my moment,either, it's my band and all that. And obviously, it's the fans' moment, you know what I mean? And I'm just--I'm just there to entertain them. It's their day out and that. It's the people that come to the gigs, innit? ♪ ♪ - When I was back in my teens, I used to collect basically any "Q" magazines, "Select" magazine-- anything that had Oasis or Liam on it, or books. This is a "Be Here Now" Live program from Earls Court. Had The Verve supporting them that night. These are the two. It's when they tried to break America. And then some gig tickets-- so Liam at the Albert Hall, at the O2 just before COVID hit, and then obviously the Holy Grail, which is the Knebworth '96 ticket. ♪ ♪ My dad died when I was three. So my older brother was pretty much my father figure growing up, right? He's 14 years older than me. And he was into The Smiths, Sex Pistols. So that was his scene. You know, he had a crew cut and that. He was the cooler older brother that you wanted to be. He used to take me out. He used to have a little old school Ford Fiesta, a little red one, with just a little tape deck in the front. And we were out one day and he had had this cassette. And I'm like, "Fucking hell, what's that?" He said, "Oh, it's this new Manchester band, just on the scene called Oasis." It was just something that was so raw and different to anything that had been knocking around at the time. He is the voice of a generation. And he's our voice, you know, he's the working class voice. And I think that's one of the great things about Liam. He makes you feel good about yourself. And yeah, from that moment on, I was absolutely sold. ♪ ♪ Just before Liam released his solo album, first one, but that year previous to that, Ilost my sister in the February to brain cancer. And then I lost my mom in the November to cancer, as well. She'd done eight years of chemo, et cetera. And she'd been in remission and recovery and so on and so forth. ♪ ♪ I was in a dark place. Like, I had had various moments where I didn't really want to be here. And I was luckily enough, I had Alf, which is pretty much the only thing that really kept me going. ♪ ♪ It sounds a bit cliche, but the fact that Liam is coming back and having something to look forward to and to hold on to was, like--it pulled me through some dark times. ♪ ♪ People just grab onto things, don't they? And it means something to them. It might not necessarily mean that meaning, but you can take from it what you want. Music does wonderful things to people. And it's a very unique process. My son Alf loves Liam. You know, I was 15 when I went to Knebworth in '96. He'll be 15 June this year. So you know, it's exactly the same point in our lives.

And then online I learned that you can actually write to Brigitte Bardot and she'll reply. Through that, I acquired a signed Brigitte Bardot postcard sort of thing. And I didn't expect it to have "my Scottish lover" on it. But I can only take that as a compliment, even if she is 87. ♪ ♪ When I went to high school, no one was into the same stuff as me. Until like a year ago, I'd never met anyone that was into My Bloody Valentine. I just never knew anyone like that. And it really made me feel a bit excluded. ♪ ♪ But I think anyone that likes the same music as me, as soon as it was announced-- basically everyone had an inkling, no matter where you are in the world, to go to Knebworth. 'Cause it is such a monumental and historic sort of concert. I just hope he can bring the same energy from the original gig. and bring that same sort of feeling that the people in the crowd have. Because everyone who was there will talk about that for the rest of their life. And I want to have that same experience. It's my 18th on the fifth. So the day after Knebworth, obviously. It's just going straight from being with my family from the train station. So it's going to be a long two days. But yeah, kind of gives Knebworth that extra kick. So I'm buying myself some beers for the train back up. The artists that particularly appeal to me are ones that have maybe been in similar situations to me, like, living in a council house. "Bring It On Down" is the song that relates to me the most, obviously, the lyric "Yeah, you're the class. You're the under class," really just stands out. Yeah, I think people are disgruntled. And I think if you want to talk about Scotland, specifically, extremely disgruntled. I think the last major lockdown was the one just after Christmas. I think that hit hard for a lot of people, as it did me. It was difficult, just sitting inside doing nothing, not being able to go to gigs, not being able to do anything. Being able to put on a record and kind of have that as like the friend that I couldn't go and meet, basically. Yeah, it was that comfort during that time. - Obviously, it was terrible for families and, you know. I didn't see my mum for a bit and the kids and all that stuff. But other people had it way worse than me, man. - There was a dark period there where you were justthinking, if there are vaccinations, will it be three or four years? And will everybody still be able to do this then? - You know, we had Brexit and that made a lot of people happy. I wasn't one of the people that was made happy with Brexit. It doesn't feel as though it's been the joyous turn that everybody expected. - People were having to, like, choose between their human rights, whether to feed their children or like heat their house. - As long as I can remember, it's always been shit.

And it's like, the government's not fucking listening. - There is a war going on in Europe. And you know, that hasn't happened for a very, very long time.

We were like, "Okay, mask. Okay, one meter." And now the bad kids are out again, you know? Now it's gonna be all together, you know, just kissing and hugging and--and happiness. - It seems like there's a generation of men that, you know, they're, like, my age and above who don't really know how to be emotional with each other in any kind of useful way, and these kind of gigs, it gives them an excuse to put their arms around each other and share something that, you know, without telling each other that they love each other, I think they're sort of doing it in a safe space. - I think it's gonna be, you know, 80,000 people in a field at Knebworth absolutely going for it.

It's a magical position to be around music and to understand it and be able to make it and be able to sing it to people who live in a fucking other world or another country that don't even speak your language and still touch them with your voice. I never took that for granted, do you know what I mean? People in Japan that speak a different fucking language and that, they hear my voice or hear the songs and dig it and tell me how much they like it and come to see us. You know, you can't take that for granted. It ain't for show, man. Thank you very much.

[cheers and applause] It's kind of hard to explain, man. It's like, you sort of-- you sort of just get into a zone, you know what I mean, a bit of a trance, you know what I mean, and just sort of, dare I say it, you sort of just become a bit supersonic. And then, you know, there's days when you can have a fucking real moment, like, a spiritual moment or whatever moment, whatever the fuck it is that you're into. It's a big fucking thing, all these people, and watching everyone's fucking faces, the joy that it brings and the tears and stuff like that and all the happiness. The word "biblical" doesn't do it justice, you know what I mean? There's no word. They haven't invented any words yet for it. But you can get a bit too carried away with that if you zone in too much. So you've gotta fucking stay on it and remain cool. That's why I think this connects because we're all the same. It's beautiful. Thank you. Goodnight. Take care of yourself. Nice one. Without you, this didn't fucking happen. Usually, we're bollocks. - [indistinct]! That was [indistinct]! [reverb humming] [dreamy music] ♪ ♪ - I thought we sounded half decent. I thought the band played great. Everyone seemed to have a nice time. And when I played in Oasis and all that, I was like fucking-- like, you know, jazz hands, you know what I mean? I was like some little giddy fucking twat off Broadway. And this time, I kind of held it down, so I'm proud of that. If the vocals ain't too good, I'm proud that I fucking kept my hands in my pockets. And the crowd were fucking-- the crowd were the best thing about it, you know what I mean? Like, it's the crowd, innit? - It's an absolute buzz, an absolute buzz. - Unreal. - That was 26 years in the making, and we're here. And we've only been here for 21 of 'em. Unbelievable. - Yeah, it was the best gig he's done by far. - Yeah. - 100%. - You know something's good when you're walking out the front pit at the end, and you just sort of stop to take it all in, don't you? - Yeah. - Like, you've just gotta close your eyes, it's one of those moments. - It was incredible. - He was singing, and I just thought, what a perfect moment to propose to her after eight years of being together and two little girls. So I did, and she said yes. So how good, eh? - How good. - As good as it was being here at Knebworth for Liam Gallagher, you know, to get engaged here as well, that was just fucking brilliant. - I'm feeling like I'm floating, you know what I mean, like nothing was real. I can't--it was like-- I have like-- I'm still there, you know what I mean? I'm still screaming, and tomorrow I might be exhausted to death, but today is gonna be the day. I'm feeling amazing. I'm feeling alive. To be honest, I'm feeling alive. - I've got a free vegan burger if you want it. - No, thanks. - I'm not gonna eat it. - No, that's so nice of you. Thank you. - No problem. - Thank you very much. - Really, I love Liam Gallagher a long time. You know? - Yeah. - So tonight is really fantastic. I'm fucking crying, really. It's amazing. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Fucking cry. - Yeah. [laughter] - Well, I went to a Knebworth show just expecting it to be, like, some fun show, and I actually got Liam Gallagher's tambourine. Oh, that made me feel so happy. I wasn't after it. - I think overall, it was all right. You have moments of fucking, like, greatness, and then, like, you know, you hit a bum note or something, and then I go into my head and go, yeah, fucking nuts, cunt. And then you kind of come out of it again. So it had its--it had its moments like every gig does. Well, that's what it's about, innit, man, like, bringing people together. We needed that after the pandemic. So to have everyone come over and just wanting to be part of it is fucking amazing, just to get us all in that field and have that special time again. - You can listen to records, you can listen to music on your phone, but hearing it live and hearing that sort of passion actually come through, it's not like anything else. It is the best feeling in the world. And sometimes it feels like it is just you, even if you're not at the front. It is just a proper magical experience. - Being there with other people, sharing it with other people, you feel the atmosphere, the passion. The minute the artist comes on stage and the electricity, you know, it makes your blood boil a little bit and, you know, the beads of sweat dripping down your face. - You know, to go to live shows with your mates when you're all connected there and you're all arm in arm, you know, to sing along and have a beer and just relax and forget about all the things that make you depressed or sad or worried. And you know, it's a unique process. - I had the Knebworth blues, man, for a bit, for a month, man, it was like that. Fucking hell, man, what do we do next? And I guess you're gonna get that when there's a lot of energy in the field, you know what I mean, and you're putting it out there. When you come back, you're sort of, like, a bit-- you're a bit hollow. I'm gonna be 50 probably by the time this comes out. So I'm just gonna go have a nice holiday, chill out, try and stay healthy. Fucking keep making music, man. Don't think about it too much, you know what I mean? For me, it's a great gig, and it's, you know, loads of people and that, but I think I could fucking-- I could do it again in another 20 years. I've got no big aspirations to change the world or whatever. I just want to live in it my way, you know I mean, and do what I do. If people get inspired by that, so be it. If they don't, fuck 'em.
