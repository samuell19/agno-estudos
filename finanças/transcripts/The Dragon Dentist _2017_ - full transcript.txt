There is a land where dragons dwell. While it may seem unfathomable to even consider a sacred pact between man and dragon, it is undeniably true that even in this age of great scientific progress, these dragons, and the dragon dentists who devote their lives to protecting them, do indeed exist. Lookout to bridge! We have visual on flagship Daboia Russellii flying her battle colors! Confirming visuals on the Lagarto doing the same! Flash signal from the Lagarto in the Fourth Flotilla. "Crossing turn-point." Fourth Flotilla Veer five degrees starboard and ready the torpedoes! Veer five degrees starboard and ready the torpedoes! Fourth Flotilla maintaining single file formation and increasing speed! Signal incoming from the flagship! "Still no visual on enemy fleet." All ships hold battle formation and keep alert for all communications! Rogen Order a response to the flagship. Send a relay to all ships. Signal the flagship! Relay to all ships! Muzzle blast sighted! 40 degrees dead ahead! Nonsense. You're just seeing that storm. They're still too far away to be of any concern. Captain, our lookouts report they still haven't spotted any ship masts on the horizon. Sir, I've never heard of ships engaging from a distance like this before. Do you think the Fourth Flotilla could have been intercepted? There's always the possibility... But, this is the perfect opportunity! Judging by the scale of that cannon fire, this is a powerful fleet that also includes some battleships. It must be the enemy's main force! Indeed. And it would appear they have yet to pinpoint our exact location. We should hold course for the original plan. The Fourth Flotilla should continue to block their port side. That will buy us the time we need to cut them off. And give us the chance we need to deal a decisive blow. Signal incoming from the flagship! "Follow our lead. Full speed. Hold rudder. Ready right cannons!" There's the opening we need. Victory may smile upon us yet. We've lost the flagship Daboia Russellii! They've been hit?! So it WAS cannon fire! There's no way they could have a lock on our location! Evade hard starboard! Evade hard starboard! How can they hit us from so far away? Are they psychic or something? We need to return fire! We don't have their position! We'll be wasting our ammunition! So be it! Prepare all cannons! Launch a barrage portside at the unidentified target! Estimated thirty thousand! Ready cannons! Barrage fire portside at unidentified target! Estimated thirty thousand! What's going on? Why are our shells exploding mid-air? There's something hiding up there. Move move move! Abandon ship! Get off before you sink with it! Someone get a stretcher over here! Captain? Captain! This is... the power of a dragon... Kokorogawari wa nanika no sei?

What's a Night Howler mushi doing out here this close to dawn? You're sure up early, Nonoko. Shibana... Good morning. What brings you out here? I couldn't sleep. You noticed too, didn't you? Hm? Sure enough, even those Cavity mushi who were out running around last night are asleep right now. You've gotten the hang of this, huh? Of course. I'm a dragon dentist, just like you. You might want to wash your face before you start work, though. Glow mushi? Why are there so many? Nonoko! Stop! Nonoko! What? That boy's a revenant! It would seem we have a visitor. Oh, great... His hair is beautiful... Yikes. So this fella here is a revenant, is he? Indeed. What's a revenant, exactly? A sign that something bad is going to happen. They say that right before some great calamity, the dead brought back to life by the dragon will emerge like this from beyond its teeth. So this kid died somewhere out there? We would have all been fine if she had just let him be. I think our boy here's an enemy officer. Probably just some rich kid who bought his way to the top. Probably the pride and joy of some snooty family. What the...? Where am I? Welcome to Hanagaki, Yazuka-Oh, Petwamsa. You're on top of a dragon! "Dragon"...? This place... is a dragon? That must mean... you're the dragon dentists, aren't you?! Huh? Let me go! The Third Peace Treaty strictly forbids the use of force against unarmed POWs! This fella sure sounds like a pain. Now he's in for some hard learnin'. Lucky him, eh? Right? Let me go! No! This is for your own good. I don't know how you met your end down there, but your war ended with it. Honestly... I could do without the dire omens. She's right. Whaddya wanna do with this guy? Ouch! Sir, are you hurt? Goh, here comes that Ozawa guy. A real working-man, that one. I will be taking that boy off your hands from here! Well, good morning, boys. We've received a report of the appearance of an enemy officer down in the teeth at sunup. Saves me the trouble of explaining, then. All those who emerge from the teeth are dragon dentists. We cannot hand him over to you. You really gonna take this fella in? He literally came out of the dragon's teeth! That means he's a dragon dentist, right? Right? Godo, just give me two hours. No, one hour would be fine. He'll be released to you as soon as we're finished questioning him. I don't think you have that sort of jurisdiction down here. Let's let the dentists handle what happens down here in the teeth, yeah? The dragon might have helped us out at sea in Unashiri, but half of the southern province is still in enemy hands. We need any intel we can get on the enemy's movements. He's just a kid. It's not like I'm going to beat him half to death. Not gonna happen. Us dentists aren't quite like you in the service. I'm begging you. You know how the Dragon's Commandments work. Do you truly have no desire to save your fellow countrymen?! At the cost of even more lives of our enemies, you mean? Sir, are you just going to let this be? The Dragon's Commandments are law. Nonoko, you found the kid. Now you can teach him the works. You're putting me in charge of him? Okay! I'll make him the best dentist you've ever seen! Alright, that's our cue. We've got another busy day ahead of us! You still haven't eaten yet? I bet you can't even get your hands on rice this good back in your coun... Godo told me, you know. He said revenants are those who have no place left to live. You aren't back here by your own choice, right? The dragon decided as much for you. Shibana! But just think about it. It's not like any of us chose to be born into this world. It just happens. One day we're here and we just have to keep living. See? You ARE hungry. Just eat. A reserve officer at your age... Your parents must have really been something. Must have been a nice life. They were both medics... in the military. "Were"? They both died when I was little. You're just like me, then. You're no draft conscript, though. You did as you were told, entering the academy for the sake of the family name, and have drifted along ever since. How can you tell all that? He doesn't have the look of a soldier to him. That's the face of someone who's never made a choice for himself. He can't even decide whether to eat or not to eat by himself. Being alive means you always have to make a choice. Do you eat or do you starve? Do you fight or do you die? Wha-?! Pretty good, right? First my own men double crossed me... Now here I am, prisoner to the enemy's dragon dentists... Mind telling me your name? Bell... I'm Nonoko! You can just call me "Big Sis." And that's Shibana, your other Big Sis! Nonoko? Alright. EVEN IN VICTDEV, ONE MUÂ§T Â£7349 EEÂ§OLUTE Bell, once you're done, it's straight to work for you! Wh-what?! We have to purify ourselves. Get undressed. Not just anybody gets to be a dragon dentist, you know?! But if there's one thing you should remember, it's this... Dragons speak to us through their teeth! Here he is! Come on. Are we really gonna let him do this? You bet we are! Right? Huh? All sorts of stuff comes out from the dragon's teeth. This morning, you popped out from one of them, but usually we just deal with these Cavity mushi here. The tiny ones there are Froth mushi. The bigger, pointier ones are Prickle mushi. These little guys are more like wild spirits than wild animals. They usually don't bother humans or anything. But as the war gets more hectic, they start to pop up, eating away at the teeth. Our "invincible" dragon's ultimate weakness lies right here. It can't use its powers if it gets a cavity. One, two...! One, two...! The dragon dentists work to keep the teeth cavity-free. The dragon dentists work to keep the teeth cavity-free. We gather up the small but lively little Cavity mushi. It's just another part of the job. We gather them up in bags, they solidify, and then we use that as... Here, hold this for a second. And we use that as a sort of anti-cavity medicine. Just be careful though, cause sometimes there are these red, shiny ones mixed in. We call those red ones antidents, and they're super dangerous to us dentists, too. You moron! One drop of the stuff and you'll lose your whole arm. We don't let little kids like you anywhere near that stuff. Woah! Ouch! Nonoko! Why I oughta...! Shut up, you old fart! We've got a Cap mushi here! It's a 2.5, no, maybe a 3! It's huge! Get outta there! Run! Bell! This way! Hurry! Get outta there! Run! Bell! This way! Hurry! Cap mushi get all worked up at the smell of human flesh! Bell! That idiot! You're a feisty one, aren't you?! You're up next, Arisugawa! Past our prime, are we, Gramps? Who you callin' "Gramps"?! Bell! You okay? Hey, newbie, quit slackin'! At least get over here and help pick up some of this junk! I swear... You're friggin' useless! This is... This stuff is from back home... It's beautiful. I guess it's kind of weird that we find all this stuff here every day, huh? Who does this all belong to? Even I couldn't tell you that. But... Look here. What is all that? Tartar mushi. These little guys are rock hard, so we remove them bit by bit each day. Go ahead, touch them. They're not gonna bite? You'll be fine. I don't know why, but these little things really make me laugh. C'mon, gimme your hand! Well? What do you think? Pretty lively, aren't they? When you touch these little guys, you hear all these happy voices deep inside the teeth. Huh? This is weird... What's wrong? Why are you crying? These are all voices of people who have died, aren't they? Huh? The voices of all the dead are passing through the dragon's teeth... All those things we just picked up, those probably belonged to the dead, too. You can tell all of that? It's not just people from your country, either, but people from mine, too. As all these people pass through on their way to the afterlife, they just... Maybe it's because it's too much of a burden, or they just don't need it anymore, but... I guess they leave behind everything they can't take with them. That's incredible, Bell. What really is this dragon, anyway? Are there still traces of my parents left wandering somewhere inside here? I wonder if there's any meaning to all of this. Or to the fact that I'm here at all.

Everyone's on break! What's the big deal?! You look like some kinda animal, eating on your feet like that! Fine! I'll sit down then! Oomph... New orders from up top. The dragon is heading south. The Southern Province, the fallen lands of Nagamanago. Right on the front lines. Ozawa and the others are all on edge. They're even mobilizing their precious cavalry garrison. Guess this means word of a counteroffensive was spot on. With the cavities around tooth 60 in the first left row as bad as they are? We're running pretty low on people up here. That's why, as of today, I'm putting Bell out there in charge of his own teeth. You're up for it, right? Inn: I just want to help the souls that are passing through the teeth. Good. Because that's exactly the kind of work we do. Good job, Bell! Keep leading it that way! Okay! Just keep running, you idiot! That was cutting it close. But you did good. What's going on over here?! Godo! Get back, quick! What the heck is that? Whatever it is, it doesn't look friendly! Uh-oh. This is bad... That's a Tengu mushi! "Tengu mushi"?! Work's been so busy lately, I almost forgot about this. Look out! That thing feeds on human flesh! Last time one showed up, we lost almost all our dentists! Where did a monster like that come from? My bet is it's all that revenant's fault. No way! The heck's going on here?! That thing can warp through the dragon's teeth! This has gone from bad to worse! Where'd this thing come from?! It's way too fast! Where is it now?! After it! What's a Cavity mushi doing all the way up here? Prepare to fire! Avoid hitting the dragon at all costs! Fire! Hey! You alright?! My leg! Oh God, my leg! What is this monstrosity? My leg! Oh God, my leg! Pull your men back! The dentists will handle this. First you tell me off down below, and now this?! They're working to save that tooth down below. We need to put this thing down up here. What the heck is going on down at the root?! There's serious damage to the gums. They're gonna give out under the weight at this rate! Tie it to the other teeth to get some pressure off of it! Shuzo! I'm fine... Hey, newbie! Get out here and help! Right! Are you out of your mind?! You of all people know how dangerous that thing is! Shibana! Gem! Forget about met Get that mushâ€œ.! What a rush! This is no time to laugh! Sure it is! What a great time to be alive! Yes! There! Get me that rope! We don't have enough people up top! Somebody drop us a rope! We need another post! Somebody drop us a rope! Don't let it hit that tooth! Nonoko! Stay clear of there! That thing could come back at any moment! That thing'll kill you just so it can go eat your nice fresh soul again inside the teeth! Tengu mushi...! Nonoko! What is this? Dying never does get easy, does it? Shuzo! It's starting to falter! Now's our chance! Get it! Shuzo! Shuzo! Antident?! So that's what weakened it for us... Today was Shuzo's time to face the Oncoming Verge. Let's all gather to honor him. Hey! Leave them be. He was a dragon dentist. Let the Carrion mushi eat him so he can be one with the teeth. Nonoko...? Today, at the sixteenth hour, Shuzo Sato served his final duty as a dentist. And so we gather here to celebrate him and his Oncoming Verge. To his memory! To his memory! To his memory. This just isn't right. How can you celebrate what happened today? Do you think he really wanted to die out there? No one would choose to die like that! The boy is brave. What's it look like down there? Those props still up? Might want to tie it a bit tighter. Think we'll need a number four? Do you even feel anything after losing him, Nonoko? Of course I do. I'll miss him now that he's gone. Right before it happened, I thought I saw some sort of apparition of him. Oh, yeah. I guess you wouldn't know about any of that, being a revenant and all. All the rest of us dragon dentists, we have to take this sort of test. Only those who are chosen by the dragon get to go on to become its dentists. We call what you saw the Oncoming Verge, but it's really the day you die. Does that mean you're gonna die, too? Everyone dies, you know. But every one of us dragon dentists, we all know exactly how it'll happen to us. I saw it, too, down inside the dragon's teeth. I saw the day my life comes to an end. It was about half a year back now when I took my test. Until then, I had just been working in the kitchen at this inn. I never really thought much of it. Everyone around me did pretty much the same. But one day, I heard that the dragon dentists got to eat fresh rice every single day. The very next evening I got up and left everything behind, just like that. Calling it a test is all fine and good, but this "test" can get you killed. Calling it a test is all fine and good, but this "test" can get you killed. Listen up! Calling it a test is all fine and good, but this "test" can get you killed. Calling it a test is all fine and good, but this "test" can get you killed.

Last night, you all were given the rare treat of some rice and curry. They made us all sign forms, and as for the other guys taking this test... But that's it. Don't forget you all are still nothing out here. Yeah, hardly your honest-looking types. But that's it. Don't forget you all are still nothing out here. Yeah, hardly your honest-looking types. But that's fine! You're all here to change that by taking this test. But that's fine! You're all here to change that by taking this test. I still don't know how I was able to commit to this so easily. But that's fine! You're all here to change that by taking this test. I still don't know how I was able to commit to this so easily. I still don't know how I was able to commit to this so easily. So let me speak from experience and give you one piece of advice. So let me speak from experience and give you one piece of advice. But... So let me speak from experience and give you one piece of advice. So let me speak from experience and give you one piece of advice. Now listen up, you hear? Dragons speak to us through their teeth! Who's there? Are you supposed to be the dragon? Not quite. I'm the soldier here to put an end to you. See? Oh! But... you're pretty handsome, at least! You really must be shaken up pretty bad. I'm pretty happy that I get to be the one to kill you. I mean, the only way to take down the dragon is through its teeth, right? With that thing chock full of cavities, we'll be able to kill so many more of your pals. Does that mean you're a bad guy? This is war. Go on now, if you wanna run on home, this is your last chance. I guess I really am gonna die someday too... Not just you. A whole lot of people are going to die. But I... I couldn't exactly tell you why or how, but I feel like I get it. I know what I have to do. You're the only one who made it back out here this round. What about everyone else who was with me? They're all one with the teeth now. They probably couldn't face their fates. They probably tried to fight back. That takes bravery. But this dragon here doesn't care much for dissent. Now then, from this moment on, you're a dragon dentist! It's an honor to work with you, sir! Well, until our Oncoming Verge, at least. Okay! Time for work! Oh, right... What's your name? My name is... It's freezing. Let's get one thing straight though. I'm never going to tell you about what I saw in there. You don't really want to die though, right? Why don't you make more of an effort to live? I'd like to live a long life eating delicious food, but... that's not gonna happen. I'm just gonna do what I have to do and enjoy every meal I get until the day comes. That's a sad excuse for a life. How is just waiting around for the day you'll die any different than plain suicide? Is living long really the only reason to live? Yeah, that's good. Don't pull it any tighter. Do you think maybe they can just handle the rest up top? Nice work. Good job. Did Shuzo ever tell you about today? No. No dragon dentist would ever tell anyone. Not me. Not you. Not even Takemoto. His Oncoming Verge was twelve years ago, when that Tengu mushi first showed up. I've never known anyone as calm and collected as that man. We still didn't even know about antident back then. It was only thanks to him that we just barely managed to take that thing down. But there's no one left to tell that story now except for you and me, huh? He never spoke a word of it to me, and I was like a brother to him. And it wasn't only him, either. We lost 25 dentists that day, but not a single one of them ever said a word about it. They might have all known the day would come, but they weren't living in fear of it. What's wrong? Were you guys planning on getting hitched or something? Wasn't hard to tell you were pretty fond of him. That's all in the past. I don't miss him anymore. Goh, what's this all about? There was an explosion out there right before that Tengu mushi appeared today. I had thought maybe it was from when the thing came bursting out, but... Are you trying to say she did this? There's also evidence that she was hiding a mushi. She kept it locked away. She made sure to feed it just enough to keep it alive, but locked up to keep it small. It's been twelve years since we last faced that Tengu mushi. The only ones here who even still know about it are you and me. And you're the one who took care of the larva we found inside of it, Shibana! Hang on just a minute! Shibana might be young, but she's a veteran dragon dentist who's been doing this even longer than me! Why would she try and pull something like that all of a sudden? Seriously! Come on, Shibana, go ahead and set him straight! We've been out there working hard every single day! Why would you do anything to harm the dragon's teeth?! What point is there in simply waiting to accept your death? You're a dentist! What more of a reason do any of us need for the work we do? The Shibana that the dragon chose is... no more! That's the Tengu mushi larva! Sh-Sh-Sh... Shibana?! So you hid away a dragon tooth fragment in your mouth, huh?! It's just perfect for hiding this darling away and letting it out to play here and there. Also, these dragon teeth fit perfectly in our human mouths. You've been suckling that thing for twelve whole years? You took the very monster that took Takemoto from you, and raised it like your own child? Maybe you might have noticed if you'd been more careful with that tongue of yours. That's all in the past too, right? You want to know what's left a worse taste in my mouth? The ridiculous way you and all these dentists live your pathetic lives! Enough! Just close that mouth of yours and let's get that thing treated. There's still time! I'm afraid not. I am already one with the mushi! I've had enough of this dragon and its "destiny" nonsense. Welcome to MY war! Dragon's teeth truly are... so sweet! Are you alright?! Shibana! Godo! You've gotten the hang of this, huh? I'm a dragon dentist! I've had about enough of that nonsense! These supports aren't gonna hold out much longer. They need to be tied back up! Nonoko! Bell! Nonoko! Bell! Nonoko! Wha-?! Crap, has anything like this ever happened before?! What even happens if that tooth falls to the surface?! Well, whatever happens will happen. And that's all that'll happen. We'll leave those two to the soldiers. We've got teeth that need care up here! All according to plan. Time to get ourselves a dragon's tooth. There is a land where dragons dwell. While it may seem unfathomable to think that a sacred pact between man and dragon could exist, it is undeniably true that even in this age of great scientific progress, hidden away beyond an impenetrable veil, these dragons, and the dragon dentists who devote their lives to protecting them, do indeed exist. International treaties have strictly forbidden the direct military use of dragons for decades. As such, dragons no longer stand as national displays of power. Yet still, the pacts made with the dragons continue on to this day. N Survey Report Restrooms Located to the Rear Would you like me to get rid of that coffee for you, ma'am? Oh... I'm okay, thanks. Doesn't look like I'll be getting any more work done tonight, though. We're unfortunately right in the midst of this year's worst typhoon. In a place like this? I've never seen one in real life before... Everyone please remain calm. You are all perfectly safe now. There's no need to worry. Yes. Everything is perfectly fine. Wait... Yes. Everything is perfectly fine. What happened to the typhoon? It looks like that dragon ate it for us. It ate it?! THE MfiQQfifiki Hup! Ouch... You dead? Very much alive. You? I'm perfectly fine. It's floating? Godo said that dragon's teeth will never touch the surface of the earth... So this is what he meant? It must be too far away from the dragon. It's just a tiny little bulb, now. Do you think it...? It's trying to get back to the dragon. The dragon must be somewhere in that direction. We better get it back home. But it's already dark. It's too dangerous to roam around out in the middle of nowhere at night. Do you have any idea how much pain the dragon must be in right now?! I know! But still... It's a boy and a girl! Just a couple kids! No sign of the tooth! I saw it fall that way. Search harder! Those are soldiers from back home... What are they doing here? Hey, kid, what are you doing out here? Wait a second... Bell is that you?! Branco! I found Bell! Get over here! How the hell are you still alive?! What's that about that little brat Octavius? Branco...? He's supposed to be dead, right? I saw the body with my own eyes! What's going on here?! So the rumors that the dragon dentists are a bunch of dead folk are true, huh? Hold it, girl. What's that? A dragon's tooth, isn't it? Nonoko! Branco! We've got company! Where's Branco?! Guy doesn't think he can die. Just look at 'im. Captain Branco! There are too many of 'em! The dead walk the earth again... That's what this dragon is capable of, huh? Well tonight's no night to die. We're pulling out! It's an honor to be able to be of service to dragon dentists like yourselves. We got word of covert enemy forces in the area, and just got out here to investigate. Is that the dragon's tooth? We need to get this back to the dragon as soon as possible. We've sent word on ahead already, but it's far too late to move out tonight. So they just fell off that dragon? Don't ya think dragon dentists can fly or something? I'll tell ya, they look like youngins, but they probably ain't. Don't ya think dragon dentists can fly or something? I'll tell ya, they look like youngins, but they probably ain't. I'll tell ya, they look like youngins, but they probably ain't. Ya think other countries have dentists like those kids, too? Ya think other countries have dentists like those kids, too? Enough! Have some respect for our guests here! Please forgive them. They're all from Sagoro out in the Northern Province and they've never seen the likes of dentists before. If it weren't for that dragon, me and my men here probably never woulda made it back from the front alive. Here, use this. In you go... By the way, can you ride a horse? Huh? I can. Huh?! You're really something, Bell. It's just something they taught at school. You're the impressive one, what with the way you'd do anything for that dragon. We've made preparations to send you two off from the airfield in Hokoadama tomorrow. Try and get some sleep here for tonight. Some other units have convened for a hunt out in the nearby mountains. My unit will stay here to watch over you though, so rest at ease. Pardon me! Please, use this to wash your feet. Thanks! We've already informed the people living here of the situation. We'll get some food for you right away, too. We've only got field rations, though. Aren't you gonna eat? I guess the food's the same no matter which side you fight on, huh... You mean- Want some? Hey! I tol' ya not ta go in there! Hello. Sorry for troubling you all like this. Oh no, hostin' the likes of dragon dentists is an honor, it is. Why don't you join us? No, no. I've got the bath heatin' up now. Feel free to use it when you're done. I ne'er thought dentists'd be so young. Ya think they're married? This wait is killing me! Why do you think those guys knew about the dragon's tooth? Shibana ratted us out. Those guys were supposed to get the tooth, don't you think? No way... Being inside the dragon's mouth is its own battlefield. Full of just as much treachery. Lieutenant! Lieutenant Starpo! Somebody get over here and help him up! What's wrong? That's an order! Get over here and carry him! We keep trucking along like this and we're all gonna end up like that. Dragging around invalids like that is the whole reason we're still stuck in this mess. So you're just gonna leave him behind, then?! As your vice-captain, I order you to carry the lieutenant! Do it yourself, then. Octavius, you little brat. A dragon? It's a dragon... It's huge... Wait, if there's a dragon up there, then that means we're still right in the middle of enemy territory! Do you bastards know what will happen if you disobey a direct order? Hands off yer guns! We're right under the dragon! We don't want any misfires! Now, now, no need to call the enemy over this way with any gunfire. I've had my eye on you. You haven't fired a single shot out here. You couldn't even pull that trigger if you wanted to. Now, I don't know if you're a coward or maybe just an idiot, but this is your last mission. Keep your screams to a minimum. All my regrets. All my misery. I remember it all bright as day, yet none of it feels real. Sleeping with you in a stranger's house like this, it's hard to tell what's a dream and what's real. They thought we were a couple, didn't they? I hope that didn't bother you or anything! You remember what you said about my hair...? It's beautiful. I like it. It's like a field of golden ears of rice, just after the rain. It looks just like... Just like...? Are you talking about your... Oncoming Verge? Good night. These Cavity mushi sure aren't holding back now that the dragon's in no shape to fight back. The buggers aren't even afraid of the daylight anymore. Does anyone seriously think we can head out to battle like this? I guess that answers my question. This is it! The real deal! Use everything we've got and rain hell on them! Trying to buy themselves some time, are they? Not if I have anything to do with it. No reports of misfires or duds at this time, sir! The reports were right. That dragon's as good as useless right now. That pact or whatever they have with that thing means it won't engage us directly. This is our chance! Kill as many of them as you can! Those are 15cm shells coming in from the fortress. I know as long as we've got the dragon's barrier we don't have to worry about it much up here, but... They've found the tooth. Nonoko and Bell should be back with it soon. Why won't you come back with me? Are you just trying to avoid the war? No. It's not that. I just... It's how you all know about the Oncoming Verge. You know, but you don't do anything! I can't stand how you all just accept your own deaths! Everyone dies someday. Why can't you even try to live any longer, though?! You think I want to watch you die out there?! What are you going to do? I don't know, but... I'm not going to become a dragon dentist. You sure about this? Alright! We're off! It's them! The plane is waiting out on the airstrip. This place could be sucked into the battle any moment now! Make haste! Bell's not with 'em... Must've run off. It's that group from last night. They don't give up, do they?! The enemy is here! I'll hold them off here. Take the dentist on ahead! Yessir! The rest of you, on me! We're gonna ride straight through! Hold on tight! What are the guards out here doing?! Get that tooth and kill the girl. I'll go get that plane. That son of a...! Dentist, move up front! H I KO-3 Wha-? I-I I KO-3 Wh..what are-?! Can you fly it? Maybe. This thing is an old Bossa craft. Get it ready. We're taking off soon. Keep your head down! Gotcha! What about the girl? Forget about her! Present for ya, Boss! Got that dragon tooth! Gaeri and Rhodrey still aren't back yet. All according to plan. Nonoko! Nonoko! Get to that plane! Hurry! It wasn't the tooth that they were after! What?! They're gonna use that tooth to get onto the dragon! What are we supposed to do now? Nonoko! That's crazy! C'mon, Bell! Seriously, what are you trying to do?! Nonoko! What's wrong? Nothing. Just thinking how we're in the clear now. That dragon has some sort of barrier that protects it from all outside attacks. But, it's a different story with that tooth now. That tooth's trying to get back to the dragon. As long as we're carrying that thing back to it, the dragon should just let us through. What the-?! That way! Over there! What's going on here?! Secure the tooth! Don't let her get away! Danger She's crazy! She's amazing... Shibana?! Still just the same old Shibana to you, am I? Don't drop that tooth! I owe you one for that. You botched this, didn't you? Why would you team up with thugs like these? Not everyone is a fan of that dragon. Not even every dentist. Now tell me, what happened to the other little brat? After today, there will be no more dragon dentists. Huh? Whoa, now! Easy there. The right Wing's been wiped out! We didn't expect them to come out of that fortress guns blazing. Without that artillery in Arane, we're as good as done for! That dragon won't be backing us up. Take the men and circle around the city to flank them! Say farewell to your precious little dragon. There it is... So it really does have some kinda magical barrier, huh? Pull up on it from below. We wouldn't want them to spot us before we land. Can't we get radio contact with that aircraft? Why aren't they following procedure?! We're gonna get wiped out by our own forces at this rate! They'll never hit us; we've got Branco the Undying here with us! Now then, time for this thing to go to work. We made it! Here's our stop. Take down anyone out there you see. Get ready! Yessir! Got it. Bell! Nonoko! What's going on?! It overcame the barrier and the dragon's power has returned?! Gimme that tooth! The hell is going on back there?! We've lost our main wing! Just land this thing already! I don't care where! Branco, you okay? Where's the tooth? We don't need it anymore. The real prize is waiting for us right up there. How many men do we have left? I take it the tooth is back. Nonoko's back too, then? Something's off, though. Nonoko, grow up to be a good girl, okay? You've gotta be kidding... Shibana, what's this all about? Are you the one who led those guys here?! All of you better get off this dragon fast. Unlike you, some of us have work to do here. Not for long, I promise. How could you do this? Your beloved Takemoto, he... "Beloved"? He faced his own Oncoming Verge in order to protect this place. That's exactly what I hate most about this place. All of us end up on the other side of those teeth when we die, right? That means he's still inside these teeth somewhere! Are you...? Don't tell me...! You want to... The dead don't just come back to life like that! Only the dragon can bring them back! We humans don't have that sort of power! I am not a human! Shibana! What is WITH this guy? It's like he's got his own barrier! Why can't we hit him?! Dammit! Huh? Let's move, Bell. Okay, that'll do it! Hey Hama, did you actually stand still this time? Come on, Takemoto, at least pretend to smile! Sheesh! Always such a grump. I don't think I've ever seen him smile even once. Alrighty then. Here, carry this. Hey, so about before... Hup! The wife must've chewed him out. Hey... The dead... They don't come back. Get back! Something's coming our way! This is bad! That thing is WAY too big! The dragon won't be able to handle this! Charge! Charge! What's going on out there?! It's down. The dragon's down? Nonoko, are you alright? How could the dragon have fallen? Is that...? They're headed for the dragon sanctuary. Well then, let's have a look at these "treasures of the dragon sanctuary" or whatever. Leave now. These are holy grounds. You know, I never was keen on you religious types. Are those men really planning on climbing up here?! This thing just keeps growing and growing! What the heck are we gonna do, Goh?! This is bad. It's gonna blow! Is this thing a Cavity mushi too? I've never seen anything like this before! This is terrible... But it's not killing everyone out there... It's not attacking the dentists either. It's just killing those with murderous intent. What the hell is happening?! Don't stop now! Fire! The 15cm shells aren't doing a thing?! That's impossible! Sounds like things are really picking up out there. This is the dragon's wisdom tooth... The mirror and the boundary. They've got the dragon blinded so it can't see. But why a wisdom tooth? The wisdom tooth is the only one that can be pulled from the dragon without hurting it. These guys used this to start their pact with the dragon. If we can just get rid of this little thing, that thousand-year-long pact should just disappear into thin air. And all this crap about people coming back from the dead will end, too! Hold it! We were supposed to sell this thing off for a fortune-! Normal guns won't work, huh? How many people are going to die out here today? Is this thing just gonna keep going until there are none of us left?! The mushi is solely intent on slaughter. Look at this thing... How far do you think it reaches? Nonoko, how do you think this mushi grew to be this huge? BY eating people? It's not eating them, though. It's just killing those intent on killing others. Which means it's probably not taking in nutrients from those tentacles out there, but... Its root! That thing might look scary, but it's still just a Cavity mushi. It's killing all those people out there with murderous intent, and then it's feeding off their souls as they pass on into the dragon's teeth. It's like it's feeding directly on that killer instinct itself. Do you think this is all because the dragon lost its tooth? I need to get this thing back in place quick. Good idea. Then you can cut this monster off at the root. That should stop it from feasting on any more souls and put an end to it. Aren't you coming with me? No! We're both dragon dentists! Come with me. Inn: Sure enough, I can't be a dragon dentist. There's something else I've got to take care of. You go on, Nonoko. Ouch! You ARE a dragon dentist! I'm the one who trained you, remember?! That hurt...! I'll be waiting for you down below! Hurry up and finish whatever you gotta do! I've got something to ask you. I'm guessing the dragon brought you back to life here, but how did it choose you? The dragon decides all. Well, fine. The pact with the dragon is over. I thought I told you already. You're just a useless coward who couldn't even pull the trigger if you wanted to. After all I've been through, I know. But tell me, did you know this? You're not the kind of man who can stand having a gun pointed at you and hold back your murderous rage. Well, you're right about that. And now, dentist... Die! I will die here, suffocating, lungs full of my own blood. This is the second time I've drowned. The first time was when I was twelve. I tried crossing the pond in our yard on horseback, but halfway across, at the deepest spot, my horse threw me off its back. The horse swam off by itself, leaving me there unable to breathe or call for help. All I could do was just flail helplessly. One of our servants came out to rescue me, but to be honest, I couldn't even tell you their name. My older sister never let me live the incident down. And from then on I never spoke to her again. That horse had tried to kill me as if it were just swatting flies away with its tail... but I still loved it. Because it was beautiful, and so long as I didn't do something foolish like try to cross some giant pond, it would remain a loyal friend. As I watched it climb out onto that shore alone, shaking its body dry in the afternoon sun, and slowly turn to stare out at me in my helplessness, I couldn't help but be overcome by the sheer majesty of it. If all Cavity mushi come from the remnant memories of those who have died, does that mean even feelings of joy and happiness can become mushi, too? I feel such sorrow for this big, lonesome dragon now. I wish I could at least find a way to prevent any mushi from being born of my own death. But, unfortunately, I don't think there's any way to put a damper on these sorts of emotions. Even if I do become a Cavity mushi myself, I know all the dentists here will handle it for me. They'll watch over the dragon for me. Will she laugh again as she hears my voice ringing out among those rocks? Or will her face just grow cold as she turns away and heads back to work? I can't quite say why, but for some reason, you and that horse of mine are one in the same memory to me. Whenever I think of you, I feel a rush of something different race through my heart. Did you find Takemoto in there? Look, Shibana, love isn't just about finding someone to be with. We have to keep alive the memories of those who have passed, too. Are you really going to preach to a monster about love? Just look at that mark. You might not look like your old self anymore, but as long as that's there, you're still a dentist. Don't think I've given up yet. She's a brave one, for sure. I never would've come up with a plan like that. She might still even pull it off someday. She's still so beautiful. What's she gonna do from here on out? Who knows? But whatever happens next... It sure is fun being alive, huh? Wait, where's Nonoko? I died once below the dragon to be brought back to life again through its teeth. Now I die here atop the dragon to be returned once again to its teeth. Did I accomplish anything worthwhile in this mysterious cycle I found myself in? I suppose there's no need to even ask as much now, is there? Still, I feel like I finally understand. I may not know why the dragon decided to choose me of all people, but... I think now at least I understand why I was given a second chance at all... It was an honor to have had the chance to meet someone like you. Thank you, Nonoko. My dragon dentist. Where did you go, Bell? Hurry up and finish whatever you're doing and let's go get some dinner! Bell! Bell! Wow, would you look at all this? Huh?
