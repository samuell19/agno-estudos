How long were you in transit? Eight months. What other countries did you travel through on your way to the UK? I don't know. If you passed through any other countries prior to your arrival in the UK, why did you not apply for asylum there? I don't know. Where did you arrive in Europe? Don't know? It was dark. Let me help you out. Where did you arrive in Europe? Greece. - Hello, mate. - Hello. Do you know why I stopped you? No. N-Not quite. Um... ...no. Where you coming from? France. You all right, Sarge? Yeah. What are you carrying? Uh, sugar, mate. - Open her up. - Huh? Open her up, please. Yeah. Yeah. - It started sticking, mate. - Really? I'll have to get that looked at. Yeah, I'll give my boss a call. I'll get that sorted tonight. You do that. So your mate tells me I took that last stretch too quickly. Sorry, boss. You know how it is on the home straight and all that. Still no excuse. - Huh? - Still no... Knife! Knife! Get down on your knees! - Down on your knees now! - Okay. - Okay. - Down on your knees now! - Put the knife down. - I'm doing it. Get down. - You stay there. - Don't touch me! - Don't touch... - All right. No. No, you're hurting me! You're hurting me. You are hurting me. - Stay down! - Stop! - You're hurting me. - Stay still! Do not move! You should get some fresh air. Nah. I'm, uh... I'm all right. You got ten minutes. It's messed up, though, isn't it, hearing stuff like that, what he saw done to his brother? I... Well, everyone's got a story. Yeah. No way could I listen to that, and I'm... I don't know. When did you last see a doctor? - A doctor? - Mm. Um, don't know. Maybe a year ago. And what do you want from the doctor? - What, like... - When you sit in the chair. Uh, work out what's wrong, figure out... - Don't want him to cry, do you? - No, but... Or tell you everything's gonna be okay... - Yeah. - if it's not? No. You want them to do their job. What's wrong? It's me. What is it? I found her, um, favorite bedtime story, the one... - the one with the whale. - Wendy. Can I read it to her? No. No, you can't. I-It helps her sleep. She... Wen... she is asleep. Can I just say good night? Wendy, it's 3:00 in the morning. Mm-hmm. Yes. Well, that would be a problem if they needed to park, but they don't, so it isn't. No. Like I said, the, um, staff entrance is at the back, meaning the back of the building, so they can just come right up to it, drop him off, and drive away. If, uh... Why don't you talk them through it if it's so difficult to grasp? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I-I can actually feel my IQ melting away. Yes, Wendy, how can I help you? Um, I just spoke to Keith, and he says that I've been taken off. Oh, I know. I apologize. I meant to get a message to you so you didn't need to come in early. It's fine, I... I'm sure you can guess why. Oh, I think I'm more than capable. What? No, of course you are. Christ, no. You're the only one keeping to the quota. No, they... No, they, uh... they want him fast-tracked. Rather keen to get him out before the election. I thought you'd be snowed under this week with the extra cases from Kent. I'm sure I can manage. Okay, great. Morning. - Morning. - Sign there. - He's all yours. - Ta. This way. Okay. And, uh, just turn to your right. Yeah, uh, and just face that wall. Yup. Okay. Thank you. Now step forward. Put your hand on the glass. And now the other one. You've claimed asylum in the United Kingdom. Do you believe you have a well-founded fear of persecution if required to return to your home country? Can you briefly explain why you cannot return? They will kill me. Before you get into your story, I should tell you the British government has carried out an in-depth inquiry and showed that those returned to Eritrea, those who left illegally, have been... Shot. I'm afraid to tell you your government are actively encouraging people to return. The extensive interview showed no evidence or mention of any punishment. Who said this, huh? Who did they ask? They interviewed 149 civilians recently returned. Did they dig them up? Have you ever been arrested, convicted, or charged with a crime in any country? Hey. Please. Why you? You're not a killer. It's impossible to forget what a bullet does to a brain. Hey! Ask again, Wendy. I don't think he heard the question. Have you ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of any offense in any country? Wendy? Your name is Wendy? It is my mother's name. Of course it is. Haven't heard that one before. Really. Wendy Tewelde. She taught me English. I believe the question was, have you ever been arrested, convicted, or charged with any offense in any country? Yes. What offense? Treason. I broke an order. What order? To shoot a civilian for trying to cross the border. May I remind you that the British inquiry... The next day, they went to cover the body, but, uh... they did not like what they see. The dead man has run. What's the punishment for treason? Stop! After six days of torture, seventh day, I could not rest. You ran across the border. I crossed the border. I could not run. Where did you arrive in Europe? Italy. Good. Most people don't tell us where. Why? They get sent back. Can you produce your own national passport today? No. I'm very sorry. - Have you owned a passport? - Yes. Can you produce the document in three days? - No. - Why not? It's in the sea. Why are we not moving? Hey, hey, sit, sit. Sit, sit. Hey, hey, stay calm, eh? You have to put it out! Come in. Home Secretary needs to be soothed, and apparently the tone of my email was not suitably soothing. Shall I carry on? Please do. Let's make it through Calais by coffee time. How am I doing? There'll be a chance for you to ask questions about the process at the end of the interview. Have you ever been involved in or supported terrorism? No. Have you ever said or written anything that praises or justifies terrorism? No. Have you ever been detained as a suspected terrorist, whether charged or not? Do you think I'm a terrorist? Hmm? Is that why... That's standard procedure when detainees leave the IRC. I want to live in England. Why would I want to blow it up? Why would you attack a police officer? It's not the best way to start an asylum application. You're going to have to come up with an extremely convincing answer for that if you want to stay. I have an answer. All night, I tried. I tried. I really thought I'd be in England by the morning. Do you know what they call people that get across their first time? - No. - Bastards. Huh? Okay. - Ven ici! - Okay. Okay. Hey! How long were you in the Jungle? Uh, 47 nights... I tried to get to England. Hmm? Eh? Hey, slow. Don't be sick. It is too cold for you to sleep here. You can rest in our shelter for a little while, but in the afternoon, my wife, she come back from the women's shelter, and if she see you, she might kill you. Finish your pasta. Maybe your last meal. Thank you. You know, people only give you something if they want something. How do they say in England? I scratch your back, then you will scratch my back? I have nothing. I'm sorry. Hey, what's your name? It was the first time in 9,000 kilometers someone had asked my name. He asked my name, and for a moment, I could not remember. I could not remember my own name. Ah. My name's Haile. The next day, I found out what he wanted. Yes. I know why you pray. You want to go to the UK, huh? You know, everybody in the Jungle want the same thing. It is why we are in the Jungle. But today, Jesus, He answered your prayer... because I will get you there. You know, you're walking away, but what is quite interesting is that I can help you. I have no money. But your English is good. So? Have you tried the train? No. Very good. Don't ever try the train, and don't try animal transport, either. You know, three of my friends, they tried the animal transport. For four hours, they lay among the sheep, and then when they get to the border, the guard, they find them. He beat them and kicked them back in the Jungle. For one whole month, they smell like sheep shit. Why are you telling me this? 'Cause you need to know that there is a better way. Excuse me. I should not have listened to him. Do you have any dependents with you in the UK? D-Dependents? Children, brothers, sisters. No. No dependents. Do you have any family in Eritrea? No, no family. I had my mother. She's still there? She gave me away. She gave you away? Yes. Why? Eh... She didn't want me. How old were you? I think maybe... five years old. So you were... you were too young to know what really happened. Maybe. Why do you think she didn't want you? Because she gave me away. Just be a moment. She's at school. They sent over the amendments. Right. You just need to sign them. Why does it say "supervised breaks"? Because that's what we agreed. Yeah. That was about going abroad! It was about any excursion. What if I wanna take her to the beach at a weekend or... You never took her to the beach, Wendy. Look, I'm at work. This isn't the time to be having this conversation. You need to... Great. You entered the UK illegally. There's no legal way. What mode of transport did you use? Are you okay? What mode of transport did you use? Now Reema has found a way that we can all cross. We buy a place on a lorry... British lorry. I have no money. Haile, never mention how much you have. W-We have the money. Our problem is that the man with the lorry places, he will not sell to us. His name is Nasrat. He's Afghani. He does not like me. He does not like anybody from Pakistan. This is why I keep watch all night. Shelters, they burn down very quickly here in the Jungle. You think he will sell to me? Yes. He will sell to you. He will tell you where to transfer the money and when and where to go into the lorry park. We will transfer the money... and then the three of us... will go to the UK. Four. The four of us. You speak only to Nasrat, okay? Okay. And do not mention me, and don't mention my wife. And, Haile... if he does not sell to you, that means he does not like you, hey? What do I do then? Do nothing. Just walk out of the cafe. You get out of the Jungle. You stay away for a few weeks, okay? Why? You see the same people every day here in the Jungle. - Mm-hmm. - Queuing for food, queuing for clothes, and then one day, they are gone. Ah, maybe they make it to the UK... or maybe they did not. Okay. Assalamu alaikum. Wa alaikum assalam. Sit. I was told to come here. - Where do you want to go? - England. This is not England. I came to talk to Nasrat. You look old. How old are you? Thirty. You look older. This is not a game for the old. I have to go to England. There are many people waiting. Some have waited for a long time. I have the payment. This will help. Shakeeb. I had to negotiate with a trafficker. - What's the process? - Like this. This isn't a negotiation. True. At least he gave me a cup of tea. Do you know his name? I made him angry once. I will not do it again. It might help your case. You understand when you are trying to cross borders, the only people that will help you are dangerous people. You speak English? Yes. Thank you. You're just in time. You know, they are coming for this place. Every time the Jungle grows, they try and destroy it. They destroyed the first one. They left nothing. Three months later, it was back, twice as big. This time, who knows? Maybe it is the end. But if you don't destroy the roots, the Jungle always grows back, eh? Mm. In Eritrea, what was your work? The army. I don't like soldiers. We are all soldiers. We have no choice. And your father? Army? My father went missing. He was from Uganda. He was a businessman like you. Businessman? No. I help the people. How much does help cost? Please. How does it work, the crossing? There is a lorry park one kilometer away from here. You go to the lorry I tell you 2:00 A.M. this night. If your money is good, the lorry will be open. How do I know you'll not just take my money and do nothing? If I was a thief, I would tell my friend in the kitchen to cut your throat, and I would keep your money. No. What I offer is civilized service, but it is complicated. The right lorry, the right driver, the right time, complications. And complication means... - Costs. - Yeah. Hmm. Three thousand euros for this. Is there a guarantee that the lorry will get across the border? The lorries always go through. No repeat business for you, then. Don't worry. More people arrive here every day... and they all need my help. There's a lot of money to be made. If you stay here one month, two month, maybe you will see. I have to get to England. England will not want you. I've always been unwanted. Shukraan, habibi. It's good. Hmm? Haile, it's good. We're going to England. Faiz, you need a doctor. Well, maybe tomorrow I'll have British doctor. If you are too sick to get there, - how are we going to find... - Haile, Haile, Haile. Stop talking. You need our money. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. The only thing that matters is that Reema gets to her family in the UK. Understand? Nasrat. What did I miss? We're in the lorry. Nearly there. Nearly. I waited in the lorry four hours. It didn't move. How many people in the lorry? - Two. - Sure? It was dark. Let's move on. Were you in contact with the driver? There's a bucket in the corner if you shit yourselves. Haile? Says it's a boy. Hmm? Because boys always arrive at the wrong time. Yes. It's Nasrat. He's reported the lorry to the border guards. - Haile, he's lying. - Huh? No, Haile. He's angry. He wants you to jump before you reach the border. Haile... he will not report his own lorry to the border guards. What the... get out of the way, mate. Here we go. All right. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh. Look, check under the fucking lorry! Jesus wept. What? No, no, no, no, no! Do your fucking job. - You're not fucking finished. - What? Check... Check under the fucking lorry. There you go! Righty-o. Righty-o. There you go, mate. Nearly fucking made it, didn't you? Yeah. Do you know how people get through under the lorry? They hang on. Yes. To hang on all the way to the port, hmm? Yes. It's very difficult. Most of them get caught. No. Most of them don't make it at all. You went to the UK on a ferry? Yes. Do you need a glass of water? No. Thank you, but I'm very fine. Faiz. Faiz. Faiz. - Faiz. Faiz. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Faiz. Faiz. Faiz! Faiz. Faiz. Faiz! Faiz! Faiz. Come on. Come on. Do you know the date? - Hmm? - The date you went to the UK? I can't remember. It's okay. I'll check the police files. You don't need to do that. Where does the UK start, in the middle of the sea? I don't know. I think, uh, territorial waters. Uh, I don't know. I think ten miles. Does it matter? No. You're right. It-it doesn't matter. Was he in UK? Hmm? Was... Faiz... in UK? I don't know. Actually, yes. Yes, he was. And your little boy, he'll be born here. No. They will let you stay. They will, hmm? No. Why no? You're not alone. They will help you. Is he kicking? No kicking. No kicking in Jungle. No kicking. No kicking. You didn't provide a reason for attacking the officers who found you or for possessing a knife. No. It's going to... If there's a situation... I mean, if there's an explanation, it's going to help someone consider your case. I understand. You said you had an explanation. I did. I was wrong. We're trying to help you. I need your signature as a declaration stating that all the information you've given us is true and correct. When you're done here, can I have a word, please? Yeah. What was that about? What? Is everything okay? Yeah. You weren't yourself in there. - Really? - Oh, come on, Wendy. Well, we both know he was lying about who was in the lorry, and what you said at the end, why are you giving the poor guy hope? He's gonna think he's got a case. Maybe he does, if you read the notes, the overall picture. What on Earth are you talking about? The overall picture, we both know it's the easiest rejection of the week. He's clearly an economic migrant. He has no dependents. He attacked a police officer. The torture that he went through was... Oh, come off it. Even if the alleged persecution, doesn't mean there's threat of persecution in the future. I don't need to tell you this. Why has he got to you? If you watch the tape, I know that you'll... Look. I didn't wanna bring this up, because I didn't think it was affecting your work, but maybe we need to look at you having some time off. I know acrimonious divorce is a car crash. I speak from experience. You throw a child into the mix... Come on, Wendy. We all knew what was going on. You've had a rough couple of years. I know that. But I never thought you'd let it affect your work. It hasn't. Good. Then we don't have a problem, do we? You'll go and write up this case, and I'll let them know that we've got everything under control. Yes. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. Everything okay? You go to the IRCs, don't you? I do. Do you know if, um... if the people for deportation, do they give 'em new shoes? No idea. I'll find out for you. No, don't worry. Don't worry. Tsk. Hey! Hey! Have you ever been detained as a suspected terrorist? No. Before beginning the personal interview, it's important that you disclose any relevant information relating to your health, including any contagious disease at the earliest stage. Do you have any medical conditions? Yes. Uh, not contagious. What's the nature of your condition? Oh, pregnant. She's pregnant. Have you seen a doctor? Yes. Okay. I'll need the name and address of your... doctor. Haile Tewelde. Haile Tewelde is in UK? That's... I'm sorry. That's confidential. You were in the lorry? Yes. Can you tell me what happened? It could help him. Please. - Hello, mate. - Hello. Do you know why I stopped you? Please, collect everybody on the lorry. Bring them here. Quickly. Quickly. The police cannot see you. Do you understand? You have to run. You have to run. What are you carrying? Uh, sugar, mate. - Open her up. - Huh? Open her up, please. Yeah. Yeah. It started sticking, mate. A crate'll come loose. That'd be the noise. I'll have to get that looked at. I'll get that sorted tonight. Shitty Czech quality. Bane of my life. ...boss. You know how it is on the home straight and all that. Still no excuse. Knife! Knife! Get down on your knees! - Down on your knees now! - Put the knife down! - Put the knife down. - On your knees! On your knees now! Do not move! Emergency assistance required. Stop! You are hurting me! - Stay down! - Stop! Do not move! Do not move! ...required. emergency assistance required. Stay still! Do not move! I ran as fast I could. And they caught him. Was his application accepted? I'll find out for you. Wendy? Your name is Wendy? It is my mother's name. Of course it is. Haven't heard that one before. Really. Wendy Tewelde. She taught me English. I believe the question was, have you ever been arrested, convicted, or charged with any offense in any country? Yes. What offense? Wendy Tewelde. "Wendy and Solomon Tewelde, editors of 'Sunrise, ' "were also arrested and beaten. Several protesters..." Yeah, can you talk me through it? No, I know... I know how to register. But how do I submit? It's for... it's an appeal. No, I've never done it before. How are you doing? - Me? - Yeah. Yeah, fine. Good. Gets easier, doesn't it? Well, it can be overwhelming, but now and then, someone gets through to you. Can't beat yourself up about it. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, I need a brief consultation with my immigration officer. Would you like to explain to me why I just got a call from the appeals court? Any new evidence must be considered in appeal. And what is the new evidence? The applicant's parents were political prisoners for authoring anti-government publication. He's their son. He's at risk. I'd understand it, it was from the others, but you know we're under review. You know I'm killing myself to keep us within the quotas so they look tough while we find the genuine refugees - in the flood of peopl... - I was wrong. I shouldn't have rejected him in the first place. Well, I hate to break it to you, but as I said to the lawyer, the new evidence can't be included in the appeal. Why? Because the appeal happened yesterday. He's going home. I suggest you do the same. Get some sleep. I need you back to your old self tomorrow. I'm not coming in tomorrow. Christ, you can't quit over this nonsense. I'm not quitting. You're suspending me. - Why would I do that? - And reevaluating - all my cases. - Wendy. You have to review every case handled by an employee under the influence of alcohol. Don't be ridiculous. Since when, exactly? Ninety-three days. - Ninety-three days. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Have you got somewhere to stay in the UK while your appeal's being made? Oh, sorry. Uh, there's an address in your file. It says a family member is gonna put you up while the appeal goes through. Reema. Reema Naheed. Got the address? I'll write it down for you. Pick up. Come on. Pick up. Are you okay? I'm fine. Look, we're just, um, halfway through dinner here. Sorry. I just... I just wanted to speak to you. I've been thinking I've got some time off work, and maybe I could come round. - Wendy... - I know... the arrangement's been made. What do you want? We can't go around like this. I've signed the papers. Thank you. You sure you're okay? What if she grows up thinking I didn't want her? She won't think that. I'm sure we can come to some arrangement. How 'bout we bring it up with everyone next week, do it properly? Do you want to speak to her? She's right here. Okay. Have you got that bloody book? She's been going on about it all week. Yeah. It's here. Here she is. Hi, Mummy. Hi.
