This is the famous Yang Jian He is the God of Erlang No way. So downtrodden Why are you so down? No, let me speak for you. 12 years ago Yang Jian, because of the Three Saints Yang Chan eloped with a human Breaking the rules of heaven and he was put under Huashan It was his own sister The Yang Chan fought against before being subdued to the mountain Using the precious Bao Lian Lantern from Huashan injuring his celestial eye. Negate his magic power. Since then, her spirit has never been able to leave. All of you What kind of people for the sake of a piece of crap putting his own sister under Huashan to divide the family and scatter their family. Yang Jian When you captured our three brothers You were so strong. Today I'll give you a good beating. Keep playing. Devil brothers Moli Hong, Moli Hai Yang Jian, didn't expect it. One day you were in such dire straits- -that you needed me to come save you-. Since that moment in Huashan 12 years ago. I haven't heard from you since then. I can't believe you've become a silver bounty hunter. I also need to eat. I'm in the corner. I heard you're looking for someone. Part of the prize Don't look for it. He's the one we're looking for here. Don't you dare interfere. Or. How dare you threaten Yang Jian? Yang Jian, You're not the same Erlang God anymore Thanks to you guys Don't run Get out of the way! Look where it's blurring Finally, I'll chase you out in the open. Boss, this is the new maid you found. You got all my men killed on that ship. Hand over your stuff. What's that? The things you stole when you went down to the cabin. Who told you? I did, I looking for Bos Hai Boss Hai, New Pet The most precious thing on the boat That's what you stole. You handed it over. Maybe I'll take one of your arms and one of your legs. Don't get involved in this if you have eyes. Excuse me Boss Hai, you have a backup. I have a backup too. You can keep this for a while. No, no, no, I'm with him. Misunderstanding I'll kill you both today. I have nothing to do with him. Beat him up. Thanks for your help. I'll pay you when I'm done. You're a little too hard on yourself. If they catch me. I'll be twice as bad as dead. What the hell is this? You really gave me this treasure. If not, how can they believe it? Aren't you afraid that I won't return it? Then I'll kill you. You have a lot of courage. Do you know who I am? I'll kill you no matter who you are. I'm Meishan Yang Jian. Chen Xiang How do you know my name? That's right. I was asked to look for you. Yang Jian, why are you here again? Why are you two brothers here again? You're not even I'll say it first. I was just passing by. The first murder is not Yang Jian Of course it wasn't. The guy who just escaped is the one you're looking for Chen Xiang. Is it a coincidence? A little thief What's all the fuss about? You really don't know who Chen Xiang is He comes from your sect. He is your subordinate. Now that you're in it today Where did he come from? Ask your Master. Divine Realm Jinxia Cave Master, you're amazing! Please tell Master Disciple-Yang Jian wants to meet Uncle Master Yang Please come with me, Master. Jian'er, you came Your eyes haven't improved yet. Yes Very powerful. I could barely open the gap if I tried. But there was only a bright golden light in front of me. I couldn't see anything. It's hard to understand. Perhaps the barrier can be broken by an extremely powerful external force. But the fear is, it will only add to the wound. Yes You've been under my guidance since you were a child. I treated you like a child. 12 years ago You sealed the Lotus Peak But there were many disasters The world of gods is in decline demons and monsters rise Maybe I was wrong. All life will eventually experience another disaster. Your four words of advice, Master Do your best Yes Do your best. For the truth to live How could you not try to make up for it? I understand. Master I met a young man at the bottom of the hill He said that he was under my supervision. His name is Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang The good boy you sent up the hill You really don't know about this When you sent him up the mountain. He was just a crying baby. You haven't seen him in a while. I named him Chen Xiang I hope his heart will be as peaceful and restrained as Chen Xiang's wood. He turned out to be My students A rebellious disciple who killed his teacher. Go with your Your senior and take a look. Master has sealed the body of Second Brother. To be destroyed someday. Chen Xiang Why would he do such a thing? I've seen it before He's a born rebel. A disobedient and unruly man. But Master remembers the Lotus Peak incident Reluctant to expel him from the mountain just to make Brother Second took him as his disciple to teach him well. Second Brother has a violent temper What hurt him? He and Shen Gong Bao joined forces. He killed second brother when he wasn't ready. Shen Gong Bao He has reappeared Yes I wonder how this child knows Shen Gong Bao. Shen Gong Bao's diversion skills are truly amazing. They also stole Second Brother's newly created magic treasure. What treasure? "Everything is as it should be" Divine Realm Fang Yi Wine Trail Good Next step With the lamp oil from the Bao Lian Sacred Lamp. The next step, of course, picking up the lampshade from the Bao Lian Lantern. Good I met a man Who' s that? My fellow teacher Yang Jian Him. He said he was looking for me. Because your Master No. He doesn't seem to know about it. Here Here here You only know Yang Jian as your teacher's uncle. In fact, he is your own uncle. He is my uncle. That's him too. He is the one who put your mother under Lotus Peak. Yang Jian's magic is naturally strong His power is also countered by Bao Lian's Lantern. Shattered into pieces If we can find all these parts Bao Lian Lantern and you can use the power of the Bao Lian Lantern. Splitting the Lotus Peak and save your mother Your teacher Your teacher's family. They are all the same Those people They gave me the name General Shen Gong Bao but put me in the eyes of the East China Sea All this talk of virtue and morality The hypocrisy is incredible. So I gritted my teeth and endured. After all these years A good chance for revenge. I finally got it. Why is Yang Jian looking for me? For the Bao Lian Lantern, of course. Bao Lian Lantern Only your mother's bloodline can use it You They also stole the Second Master's newly created magic weapon. "All things are as they should be" He stole the treasure from my brother.

This unspeakable pain The pain of longing. What a song. Why does Erlang stay? I don't know why The last time I saw you I felt like I knew you. But I don't know where I've seen you.

At that time you were just born. You didn't even have a name yet. Just Just a little bigger. My Junior I know he' s grumpy I don't know why Master gave you to him. Did you have a hard time there? I' m fine. Just not having anything taught to me. Beating me every day. Made me starve. Called me an illegitimate child. Sorry, I didn't know. But even so You can't kill her. Then, you shouldn't have destroyed my mother under Lotus Peak. Let go of me! Well done, Yang Jian. Chen Xiang, you have killed your fellow disciples and destroyed your ancestors. I was ordered to arrest you. You Surrender now. This time we saw it with our own eyes You let it go. We'll catch you. Don't bother. When I'm done with this job I'll tie myself up and give myself up. Yang Jian, sorry to offend Fire and Wind Binding Strings Your teacher is also here Very cunning. It's not like your brothers. Last time in the battle of the gods You defeated the four of us. Didn't you also use cunning methods? That's right, Yang Jian, I always advise them. That you can't possibly do it. You admit your mistake in this matter. If you have difficulties. I'll break it down for you in heaven. What have I done to me? What is it? You conspired with Chen Xiang ..in the murder of a fellow student I No. New people, making a lot of noise What's going on?

Divine Realm The Clarity Tower of Fang Yi The lampshade is in the tower The lights come from the lampshade I don't know who found this lampshade. It was used as a navigation light. Do you have to drink so much? Long ago in heaven and earth All dynasties must... The only thing that matters is wine How can we know the rest? King Zeng Chang Long time no see. Waiting for a long time Nice to meet you. This is Chen Xiang Kill Master King Zeng Chang You Know Sooner or later, the birds will fly out We demon brothers don't want to see that side of the world. From now on there will be chaos. But that group of birds how can they survive for long? This Huashan Although it looks shaky today It took our lives to hold that bird at bay. For one more day As long as we can Mo Liqing Then this time You and I are now enemies, This is real. Doppelganger You can do it too. At a young age How dare you learn the evil art of Shen Gong Bao? And trained as a genin. I can win, anything goes. Run, boy! Chen Xiang Hurry up and leave! Hurry up and leave! Brother We meet again You still look good. Shen Gong Bao Yang Jian Long time no see. I heard you were very late. The eyes of heaven have been damaged. How unfortunate, the young Yang Jian who defended Lotus Mountain. I like that Yang Jian What about Chen Xiang, Shen Gong Bao? He escaped on his own. That cruel kid. Like when I was young. He is my heir. Do you know where Chen Xiang went? His little secret Lishan Du Yue's pond Your wounds Who is it? Life is like a Parasite What's the point of worrying too much? I' m not happy today. The years... such a rush Divine Realm Toudu Kou reliable? It' s done. What's going on? I snuck in some stowaways. Clear Anyway, it' just a small stowaway device. Only one person can be sent there It was long, I' ll also go. I forgot to say, back then. A bit shaky. What do you mean? Long peace on earth Human Realm Chang'an This is Chang'an? There is a war on earth Lishan You' re coming. New Lamp Oil for the lamp Old lampshades Bao Lian lantern What is this? Since you' ve come. No need to hide. You tell Chen Xiang The real purpose of the Bao Lian Lantern Why are you here? Under the Lotus Peak in Huashan The flock of Xuan birds has been subdued They are the spirits of all fire They have the power to destroy the earth and the sky. When they explode, heaven and earth will be destroyed. Nüwa gave your mother the Lantern This precious Bao Lian lantern She guards the Lotus Peak day and night. But twelve years ago The birds were restless Bao Lian's lantern couldn't hold them back. I have been ordered by Master to help your mother. But Xuan's strength is too strong. The lamp is broken. Last Moment Your mother jumped from Lotus Peak Trying to block Xuan with her own body. Brother, I'm counting on you. Sister! You must guard Lotus Peak. I used the axe and drove it into the rock. Finally, the bird was stopped. And the Eye of the heavens Can never be opened again That is why my mother was sealed under the Lotus Peak. Not because she married a human Chen Xiang My mom married a human too She gave birth to me and your mother I was too injured to take care of you. So I sent you to Jinxia Cave. Then why did you never visit me? You're my uncle! Master said I'm not allowed to visit you until you grow up. Is he telling the truth, Granny Wan? Granny Wan he' s telling the truth Yang Jian Your mother, You Ji, is my sister. I have a name. Goddess Wushan There's more to it than that. Follow me. Huashan That's Lotus Peak That light The birds at the bottom of the peak in a state of restlessness My mother, she is trapped under that mountain. The beacon on this hill It is said that king Zhou tried to make her laugh Fire Beacon The result death of the body and destruction of the kingdom Everything is the woman's fault Do you know why the Bao Lian was used to prevent Xuan? Because of Jinxia Cave. In the beginning, your master used the power of the Xuan bird This is how the cave was built The xuan bird came out Jinxia Cave will collapse as a result. Subdue the Xuan Bird Keep Jinxia Cave from collapsing. That is the true purpose of your master's request that you restrain Bird Xuan. Master only told me that you can save the world by stopping that bird. Endure the Great Tribulation He didn't tell me that it had something to do with Jinxia Cave. Your master is only for himself. Everything must go full circle The Xuan bird must finally fly away. Can it be stopped? Remember when you split the Lotus Mountain? When was that? I cleaved the Lotus Mountain The last great disaster Your master is just a man who protects his Jinxia Cave. Your master lied to you. We split Huashan Save Yang Chan. Miss Wan Luo, even if what you say is true But it's a big deal. I must take you to see my Master. And face it head-on Chen Xiang, you come too. Who wants to come? You're the same as that cave man. If you don't go, I'll go alone. Chen Xiang It has come to this You still want to find your teacher? Goddess Wushan I'm just afraid Chen Xiang is with you. Will end up like Shen Gong Bao Why are you saying that? That time at the Ying Chau Music Hall. .. I was mesmerized in my dreams In that dream, mother told me to go to the mountain Jian'er Splitting the mountain That person is not really my mother That's you. Goddess Wushan The dream is upside down and confusing This is your way. Chen Xiang's Master Of course Chen Xiang didn't hurt him Neither did Shen Gong Bao. The wound on my brother's body Is a piece of silk screen When I found Shen Gong Bao He was still alive. Although he was first injured by a powerful magic weapon But what really killed him was... The same silk screen wound Just before The net that you threw in the middle of a precarious situation. And the net Is your unique magic. Chen Xiang's Master And Shen Gong Bao You killed them all. You Great Why did you kill them? Your teacher isn't dead yet. How did you leave Jinxia Cave? Unfortunately Shen Gong Bao We agreed to work together How could he be injured so badly? It's better that he dies. I must help him end it. Why did you do it? Chen Xiang, I did all these things To split the mountain. To save your mother Not like you. But you still can't kill them. Stop it! I Give it back to me. It's too hot. I took it off for you. It was on the wrist the whole time. No one can take it off. How can you Maybe... Because I am your blood uncle. Your mother wove this from her hair. Before she jumped from Lotus Peak. Asked me to give you this hair rope. This hair rope is the wick Ignite the wick of the Bao Lian Lantern. I miss mom so much. Let's go to Huashan On the way we discuss this Nine Revolving Mysteries Human Realm Huashan your home This is my home. Mom Let's go. These are the characters in the list of deities I'm too familiar with them. There really are gods in Huashan This is my mountain axe. It seals the mountain you split Not completely. The power of the Xuan Bird that appeared You can see it. Yang Jian Hurry up and leave! Strap on Chen Xiang, go back! Uncle! Finally caught you, you traitor! How precious is Taiji's diagram? When you think of something, it will appear. The mind thinks of everything and everything comes. Only this Taiji diagram can trap Yang Jian. Jian'er Jian'er Mom? Mom! Jian'er Splitting the Mountain Jian'er Mom Lotus Mountain has been opened It's time for me to go. Why? This is destiny. The fate of the women in our family Is to defend the mountain To protect the peace of the world Mom No need to cry You see? This little fire It's all mom.

Defend Huashan Defend Huashan Peace in the World Defend Huashan Peace in the World I'm counting on you, brother Your eyes haven't improved 12 years ago You sealed the Lotus Peak but there were many disasters Maybe I was wrong. All things must suffer again after all Master To keep the truth alive How can we not try to redeem it? Master This is the Taiji diagram You trapped me in a Taiji diagram. My wonderful student. You were able to slow down the illusion of the taiji diagram. I remember I remember the Taiji diagram. I remember Yin Hong being attacked by his master. Turning into flying ashes in the Taiji diagram. Master, what did I do wrong? Yang Jian I can't allow Chen Xiang to split Huashan It's really all because of Jinxia Cave You know Jinxia Cave must not fall I've worked very hard to keep Jinxia Cave from falling overnight. So Yang Chan is under Huashan That is his destiny. Jian'er You don't know. Your Yang family Mother and child are born into a great tribulation that will shake heaven and earth. For the sake of world peace Mothers hold back the mountains And the son To free the mother he had to struggle to split the mountain You don't know. Splitting the mountain Bird Xuan came out of the Jinxia Cave collapse. Bringing great tribulation to the world. Until the Great Tribulation ends the world will not be calm once again Jian'er You are the one who will split the mountain This time it's Chen Xiang's turn Master I didn't have a father and mother back then You took me in and raised me. You taught me all kinds of mystical arts and techniques. Used me so that I could someday have the power to split Peach Mountain And you took Chen Xiang under your wing Not to teach him the mystic arts and not to tell him-. -about his life so that he could understand the folly of You deceived him so that he couldn't go and split Huashan. Right I'm just like your mom. I'm here to keep the world safe. As long as Bird Xuan stays at the bottom of the mountain for a while. Jinxia Cave will last a moment longer. Jinxia Cave will not last long. Xuan Bird is becoming stronger the longer it is suppressed. One day it will explode. You protect your Jinxia Cave It's not about disaster at all, it's about protecting yourself. This Jinxia Cave is the result of my life's work. We're all in this together. And lost it all. Even if it's wrong It's only wrong until the end. Master I'm just a pawn for you. To me Jinxia Cave I can only bring you together. With Taiji's diagram Tying the Eternal Rope with Taiji Diagram I borrowed it from your brothers and uncles. We have the same plan. The world can't get any messier.
