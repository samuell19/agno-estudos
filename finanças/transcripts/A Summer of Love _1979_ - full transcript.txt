A Summer of Love When did you last see Simonsson? A fortnight ago. Be careful here! Nothing's happened here. You stand back. Be careful! Make sure that nobody else comes in. She must have been lying there for a couple of weeks. Take the cat away. Lift it up. Come on! I want to see! Take the kids back! Are they coming to take her away? Come here! I feel so uneasy. Uneasy about what? I don't know... the kids. Imagining her lying there all that time... ...while we were living as usual. Don't think about her now. For heavens sake... she's dead. It's not as though you're used to thinking about her at all. You should sleep now, Ingrid. To tell the truth, I was also scared I felt the presence of a cold, unspeakable horror Maybe it was a fear of the incomprehensible in human destiny. Fear that her time... was a precursor to the void. That old woman who'd passed over into the great darkness... She really was an old witch. Never spoke to anyone... lived a minimalist existence... ...though apparently was well-off. I realised that the house where we lived loomed over us like an ancient monument with its sheer, sinister front and plaster angels at the entrance. I held onto the place for my wife's sake... ...as our lives slipped apart unceasingly. I thought of her less and less. Two children handed over to strangers. Stop jumping now! Where are those x-rays of the mice? I've got a headache. Hey... kids...! Leave Mummy in peace! Have you got dressed, Ann? Ann...? Get dressed, I said! Did you hear me? Get dressed! Ann! If we could extend the activity of the thymus gland... ...keep the organism young... ...then human youth could be extended... drastically extended. Life... instead of death. Mr Jernberg... a letter from London. Are you going to Mill Hill? Yes. Fucking hell...! Some people have all the luck! Congratulations! I should travel as soon as possible. Can't risk a chance like that! Calm down, you're not going to be risking anything. I was supposed to go there, just after the war. But your mum wouldn't have it. Incomprehensible...! ...since she'd always yearned for London. It was because she couldn't get there when she was having a concert. But you were already on the way. Now I'll show you an interesting new gadget. This thing's incredible. Stretch your leg out. Not your arms. Just your leg. You're looking so fucking worried! Won't take long. When we were little, we ran in the woods. WE? Don't be pedantic! You looked much healthier then. More vitamins and exercise! Let's see now... Right... left... Then down! Amazing, eh? Yes? Is that you, Ingrid? How could you know I was here? Yes he's here... It's for you. Wait a second... we'll lift you up... mechanically... amazing, eh? I'm sorry, but I realised you'd be there. It's Mrs Simonsson's funeral today at 2.30. I have family counseling. I can't go. Someone should go. Just forget about it. She was our neighbour! We've seen her every day over the last 8 years. I never saw her. I simply don't have time to go. In the name of our graceful and merciful God... ...we now consecrate the perishable dust of Elsa Simonsson to the resting place of the grave. You have come from earth... and to earth you shall return Jesus Christ, our Saviour, will raise you up on the last day. Our Father who art in heaven... Lord, son of God, saviour of the world, Lord God, the Holy Ghost... ...have mercy on us in the moment of death. Help us, gentle Lord... May the Lord bless us and preserve us. May the face of the Lord shine upon us and be gracious to us. Turn towards us Lord, and give us peace. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Do you have a car? Are you going into town? I have a car, if you want a lift. Were you a relative? Of Mrs Simonsson? Your uncle's cousin's sister's aunt or something, eh? You know very well she was my foster-aunt. She was my stepmother's aunt. Richard will get out up here. he lives here. 'Bye... - Where do you live? - Tensta. I can drive you home if you like. You've probably never been to Tensta. When I get my car I can drive you. An Alpha. A guy from Italy is going to give it to me.. Have you ever been to Italy? Yes, I... I really dig Italy. Richard and I honeymooned there. We thought I was pregnant... but I turned out I wasn't. Now he lives with Bert. They're in the same band. Richard's a musician. Listen... I really should get back to the Institute... but... ...maybe I could offer you something... a coffee... wine... ...if you've no objections? I haven't told you my name. It doesn't really matter. You're some old guy who gave me a lift. Isn't that enough? My name's David... David Jernberg. I'm a biologist. Cool name! Wasn't he a prophet of something? He was a Jewish king. I sing. Twice a week, down at the club. Is that you? Is that your phone number? No, that's the club's. You can have Richard's number. I might be starting in a puppet theater instead. How do you make a living? - My living? - Yeah. You must have some sort of job. Must I? Fuck off! Piss off! Scram! Eva! Maybe I could give you a lift some other time? You'll give me a lift again? When would that be? Next week... about this time. If that is okay? Why wouldn't it be okay? C U N T L O O K Can't we go soon, Daddy? See Mum... I'm busy with numbers. You promised to take them to the fun park. Today? So are the kids dressed? 1,500 kronor...! "Eva, I've had an unexpected visitor from abroad." "Because of that, I can't come the day I suggested. David." "P.S. Can I make it some other time" We'll wash your hair now, Lena! We have to leave in 5 minutes. I don't want to go! I don't know Wirane and that American. You'll get to freshen up your English. I just don't want to. It's a chance to try something new. A chance for you, maybe. How would it be for me? I'd be looking after the kids, without any friends. Here, I at least have the school. I thought you wanted to finish with that? At least I have someone to talk to there. I don't get a word out of you all day. Go on your own! What does socialism achieve? What socialism? Isn't that typical... suggest you're under socialism, and you deny it. It's only 5 percent. 5 percent is state-owned. 7 percent! George said you're doing research on... aging. The aging process. There are people who'd like to live to 300 years old. Possible for the young. Good Lord... 300! Isn't that a terrifying thought? In 300 years time... No...! You'd be lying down at night, wanting to sleep... Instead, you'd be afraid. At that moment, I myself was gripped with a fear... concerned that I had worked at making a mistake. Taken the wrong road. Backed the wrong horse. I stood on the balcony that jutted out into the gloom ...and felt time slowly sweeping past my face... ...the irreversible time that was my life I had a wife, but barely talked to her. I had 2 daughters that I knew nothing about. I don't know anything about the world I move around in. - Hi there! - Hi. What have you done with your American? The American? Well, he was also... He was invited out to dinner. So I... yeah... This is David. He gave us a lift home, after the funeral. David. Did you see the show? He's not interested in seeing your act. I came too late for the show... I couldn't make it. We try to give life a chance on stage. David's a biologist Big on stamens and pistils? Are you leaving? I can give you a lift if you like. - Do you have time? - Yeah, I've got time. He was much shorter than Mum. But he was smart. He managed to keep a mistress. Dad's a scream! Then I met Bonnie. She had a lover. Then Sonja found time to get divorced twice. I was in Italy with her. Venice... I love Venice. Mario proposed to me right off. His mum had a pet monkey. We could change its clothes. Pretty funny. Then Richard wanted to get married. Yeah... so we did. It was to do with the fact that I was pregnant. Maybe it was the wine she'd drunk. Maybe too much. There was something captivating yet painful, in her rambling. There was no fixed point in this girl's life. Someone for whom nothing, not even feelings, really sunk in. Everything was blurred, and ran by as a formless dream. I wasn't sure if I felt consternation or enchantment. You're funny. What do you mean by funny? I don't know. Do you always have to mean something? The Institute's number? Yeah... that's if you need anything. I'll probably lose it. Aren't you asleep? I woke up. What's the time? When did you get home? I don't know. Ages ago. I'm sorry I didn't go with you. I didn't feel up to it. It doesn't matter. Did you enjoy it? So-so. You left early. Did it go late? Sure did. But it was very agreeable. It was a pity... ...you couldn't stay. Rosen told a story about... ...elephants. No... if we should write about an elephant's love-life. Have you heard it? Yeah. The Frenchman wrote "L'amour des elephantes". The Englishman wrote... "Elephantine". The German wrote "Kurze Einf?rung ...die Milieu den Elefanten". The Norwegian wrote... No, the Swede. The Swede wrote "What was done to elephants during the war?" The Norwegians article was titled... "About Norway." Hi! If you hadn't picked me up, I'd have been even later. I thought you'd phone me. Phone? Am I supposed to phone? I don't even know your name. It was on my card. There! Oh, yeah. I didn't say I'd ring you, did I? Why did I come? I had to do something I could ill afford. Why did I waste my important time in such a stupid, pointless way? Hi, it's me. Where on earth are you? Lena has called in sick! I was obliged to have lunch with those Americans. Their last day in town. You can say that your daughter's sick. Wait... Ann wants to talk to you. Hi, Daddy! Hello my pet... what is it? When are you coming home? I'll be home just as quickly as I can. Can you pick up some carrot juice from the health food shop? You can't go wrong with that. Carrot juice. Thanks, that was a real birthday party. Is it your birthday? I don't usually celebrate it. I haven't for a long time. Don't you want anything? No, there's nothing I want... Well, perhaps an old villa between Florence and Venice. But I'll be dead before I get that. Dead? Why? Maybe I don't like living. Wait a moment! A birthday present! Eva... Are you unhappy? Are you crying? Stop it! Do you have to ask questions all the time? I'm sorry. But I'll have to go now. Maybe I'll phone you. Make it late... because Ingrid... My wife goes to sleep early. We don't have much time left. Don't we? I'm going to London. I'll be there a year. It didn't make any difference to her if I went to London or Greenland. Whether I went away for a year or forever, meant nothing... was equally irrelevant. Every time I left her, I resolved it was the last time. i thought of my children, of Ingrid... ...my work, my obligations. Everything that I'd put aside without knowing why. I comforted myself by saying that nothing had happened. It was all totally innocent There was quite simply nothing to it. Hello? Hello, it's Eva. I would have rung before, but I've been sick. Did I wake you up? No... I was sitting down, working. Is your wife asleep? Mmm. I was at the movies and I felt like ringing you. Whereabouts are you? In a phone box at Karla Square. Listen... Wait there till I come. Just wait! Get back to bed! So, where are we going? Don't know. Do you like driving around. Yeah. The faster the better. Are you never scared? Scared of what? I could drive off the road. Do you realise? You're not afraid of dying? I never think about it. It doesn't matter, anyhow. What doesn't matter? If I live or not. Why have you stopped? There's something I want to say. Eva... I like you. You like me? Yes... Very much. Great! I dig people liking me. At least you know how to kiss. Of course. I thought old gents had forgotten how to. David! Aren't you asleep? Why were you going out in the middle of the night? I was just at the Institute. Checking... I had to check some stuff. You look deathly pale! It all went well. What went well? I thought you were asleep. I didn't want to wake you up. I need to sleep. Didn't you realise I was worried that something had happened to you? What could have happened? I don't know, anything! It's late... I'd like to get some sleep, okay? Well, if you refuse to say anything... What do you expect to hear from me? Ingrid... Are you crying? David... At one o'clock... I rang the Institute. The night-watchman checked... and you weren't there. Something weird has been going on for weeks now. I never thought you'd lie to me. That's all I ask of you... don't lie to me! It's late now. You have school tomorrow. You need to sleep. Do you think I could sleep now?! I think I've fallen in love. Is it someone I know? No. Is she younger than me? What does that matter? Yes she is. So what? - Is it someone at the institute? - No. How long have you been doing it with her? We haven't been "doing it". Where were you? Just... out. Where?! We met... We were outdoors. Why is that so important? Is she pretty? I don't know... It's just that I can't get her out of my head... that's all. - Have you slept with her? - No, I haven't. - Did she say no? - Will you please stop it, Ingrid! What's the point of this? I don't want to deceive you. But you will, won't you? What? Did you buy them? You're nuts! Hello? It's me. Did I wake you up? No, no, not at all. Whereabouts are you? I'm as pissed as a fart! I'm at this really cool place with Vincent. Wait... I'll ask him. Whereabouts Ar we? He says it's old stables. You know it, in Gamla Stan? No. You should see Vincent! God, but I love him so much! Do you? You should be in love, too. I can't be in love with a lot of people at the same time. I'd forgotten that. You're such a goody-goody! Can a scientist be called a goody-goody? How long are you going to be there? I don't know... It depends on what Vincent wants to do. No, I have to go now. Bye! Hello! You waiting for me? Yes, I... I finished early. Know what I did today? I've been studying plants at Haga. A lot of kids have never been out in the countryside. David, it was sweet of you to meet me. It made me very happy. Hold this. She never gets better. She can stay with Dad and Mum for a few days. Would you be able to drive us there, Saturday or Sunday? Eh? What are you thinking about? You know your mum. She'll want us to stay. I'll lose days there. How about I take you on Friday evening. So I can... I'd be able.. You take the train home on Sunday evening and I'll pick you up at the station You could come from town. Then I lose a whole day I can ill afford. I know very well why you don't want to come. It suits you very well to have us out of the way. Ingrid, it's all in your mind. It'd suit you down to the ground. So stay at home. Lena needs to get out in the country. Alright then... I'll take Lena on the train and you can take care of Ann in town. - Eh? - Yes! So when are you leaving? Forget about it, dear! We can take the bus to the station. But I'm not sleepy. Ann my pet... Daddy really has to work. Off to sleep now. Don't close the door and leave the light on in the kitchen! Is this your living room? Yeah. Though I work in here, too. Not very nice. Why is that? Too much stuff... Impersonal stuff. I'm dead tired. I moved into Vincent's studio. Two other girls were living there. They cleared off this morning. I haven't slept for 3 days and nights. It's so quiet! Put a record on. We don't have a gramophone. And Ann's asleep. That's my daughter. She's 8 years old I could have had one, too. It was before Rikard. I was too young. It's so terribly quiet... is there no way to play some music? What'll I tell you about, now? I can talk about Rikard. Do you have to stare at me like that? You fascinate me... That's why. I like you so much, Eva. You're so beautiful. Want to fuck me? Why do you ask that? You know very well I want to. There's no need to ask. Get on with it, then! What are you waiting for? It was good you went away. I had time to think things over. So you didn't see her? I couldn't go out. I was looking after Ann. I didn't want to see her. I wanted to think about us. I mean, she's a vulgar, uninteresting and stupid girl. Why have I bothered about her? The only one I care about is you. I couldn't live without you and the kids. It's good that you care about us. Why not her? You're the only one I care about. I can never love anyone else. You always exaggerate, David. Everything. Already by then I felt that truth was not that simple. What I said to my wife was true... but at the same time I wished for the first time that I wasn't there. Wished I didn't need to do anything, or ever needed to lie... Never needed to utter a word other than a plea... ...a promise or a confession. I longed for quiet, self-esteem and solitude. At the same time I needed Ingrid, and people's acceptance. I was ashamed. Would I always need to feel ashamed? Jernberg. It's me. Were you asleep? Doesn't matter. What time is it? No idea. I've been singing. Trying to cheer up a bit. Then I felt so bored I had to ring you. Bit of a surprise. I didn't think... you wanted to see me again. What do you want to do? Well... Can't we come up with something? I don't know. What time is it? Wait a sec... I'll check. Listen... would you like to... ...go for a drive? You don't go driving with anyone else? Just me? No one else. If you drove with some other bird, I'd be furious. Is that you, David? I'll take it off, but I wanted to show you. Do you want it? It costs... 1,235 kronor. Are you crazy?! A dress for 1,235 kronor! A cheque for you, Mr Jernberg. Wiren wants to see you. No, I haven't time. Could I get a coffee, though? Coffee? What's wrong with that? You never drink coffee. Well I need one now. I'm so tired. I worked all night. Sugar and cream? I don't know... I never drink coffee. Jernberg. Hi! What are you doing tonight? My mistress let the water run. Typical of her. Here I lie. She rang for me. Perhaps she does love me. She rang. In five days I'm on my way to London. I'm going to lecture in a strange auditorium. I'm said to be obsessed with my work. I should be doing something else than lying here waiting for her. I'm waiting for her... There's just one thing I'm waiting for. I'm besotted with her. Everything else disappears... Disappears into the background. Is it really possible that I'd sacrifice everything for this moment? In fact, it is. What's left of me? Am I still as I was... ...or is this what I really am? Do you still love me? Still? Will you still love me tomorrow? Shan't we be here in the morning? You always have to be thinking about something. Thinking about what is going to happen. Can you love me until I fly off? Are you going away? Oh, that's right. I always forget everything. You're going off with your beloved wife and little children. What are you going to be doing? Lecturing... at a university. I'll be back in a year. In a year? Why talk about this now? In a year I could be dead. Or maybe you're dead. Or your beloved wife. I can't imagine what it will be like over that time. Sometimes I can't imagine the sun coming up in the morning. I think the night will never end. Don't you look forward to a new day? It always ends up different. When I was little, I looked forward to Dad coming home from work. But he didn't come. He went off with someone else. I was happy to meet Rikard. The first time we went out together... ...it was for a week. I was at a party first. In a big house. They drank a lot of wine. A big guy dragged me into a room. He wouldn't let me go. Not until I let him fuck me. I came to Rikard too late. I tried to kill myself. I cut my wrists. They took me off to the hospital. David, wake up! What's wrong with you? Why don't you get up? It's after 8! I slept in. I worked on the lecture so late last night. I woke at 2 and you weren't in bed. I was writing until 3 o'clock. I'll get an early night tonight. You're going to the movies with the kids. Today? It's Friday, isn't it! Lena was so happy... What are you talking about? It's alright... I am too. I'm looking forward to it. How are you feeling though? A bit tired. No... I can see something's bugging you. No, I feel fine... It's quite OK. You didn't see HER did you? When would I do that? I'm working, I'm working the whole time I'm not here. So you're tormented by not meeting her. Will you stop it! Just leave me alone! I'm happy. There's no problem. Drive faster! I can't see. I can't see anything. - Drive faster! - I can't see. Drive while I'm kissing your eyes! We'll be killed! So what? I was hurtling into ruin, but I was indifferent to it. She wanted me to drive, so I drove. At first I was afraid of death. Now I was happy for her to kiss my eyes. Maybe Death was driving with us. Maybe that was Death sitting beside me. I love the sun. I could lie here all day long. Where does the sun shine at night? On the other side of the Arctic Circle. Drive me there... ...to that circle! Or to Italy. It's warm there. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's that? - What is it? - Be careful! That's cocain, isn't it! How would YOU know? We use it in medicine. Fucking hell... leave it alone! Fuck it... let go of it! Eva... It's illegal... don't you understand? Promise you won't use that any more! You're not my father. I don't have a father! You're not Welfare or the police! Go to hell! I'm going to Italy in a week. Italy? We only have 5 weeks left. What 5 weeks? Before I go to London. What's it to do with me? But you said... You agreed we'd see each other as much as possible til then. Am I just to rot in town? You said we could see each other! Did I? Maybe I did. You said you loved me so much you couldn't live without me. Among other things. So why go away? Stay here, if you can't live without me! Maybe consider me instead. Am I supposed to let you fuck yourself silly, till you go off with your missus? No way! You can enjoy yourself playing 'happy family' for the 5 weeks! I have to tell you... I've become obliged to leave for London earlier. Within a week. When did you drive from Uppsala? Around 9. I phoned. Phoned? How did you do that? It was just to request the biology congress. The secretary didn't know if you were there. I spoke to Wiren. He sounded very strange. He went looking for you. He came back and said you'd left about 2. He was wrong. I joined another group after lunch. David, I know that is not true. I know that you've been with her. Have you nothing to say? What can I say. I've said everything. I was with another group. I left about 9. David... Come here! Once you said to me that you would always... love me. That you would always like me. Remember? That you'd never leave me. I haven't left you. Oh yes... you HAVE left me. Do you really think I don't notice anything? You think I'm made of stone? You've left us. Your lab rats and rabbits mean more to you. And now this girl... I don't know who you're talking about. The way you carry on makes no sense. Don't lie to me! Stop lying all the time! I'm not lying. Stop blubbing! I can't take any more of this lying, David! I'd rather be dead! For too long I had suppressed the frustrations within me. For too long, I'd underrated them... Not given them a second thought. Now they overwhelmed me and drove me in one direction. I was hurtling towards the abyss. I had loved the forest... but there were no trees anymore. Loved a sky that no longer existed. Everything was bloodstained. I was trapped in a low, burning vault. I could feel the flames. Really gorgeous! Shall I put them on? Isn't it a bit too warm? Is nothing else important to you? Can't I look at presents? Have they all got them? You don't believe that I know what I live for, do you? Ask me, some time. Though, how would I know? You only live for your work... ...so you'll make some massively cool discovery. I don't plan on working. I think it's boring. Look... That's Tower Bridge. Look! Eva... Eva? Here... here it is! I'm tired. I don't give a shit about your old mum and her damn concert! I hate going to concerts. Look! Aren't these lovely? Don't you like them? I'm just not in the mood. Fuck it! You're not in the mood?! I bore you to tears now, eh? Because I don't know what I live for. I hate it when people are "not in the mood." You look as though you're bored to death. Maybe you should stop looking at me. There's nothing more boring than a goody-goody who's bored. This place is crawling with cool guys. Maybe you should go get yourself some. First you're gonna fuck me one more time. Come on... Come and look at the boots! They're nice. You mean we'll eat and then go back to that dreary hotel? That's what I'm suggesting. I want to have some fun! I'm sick and tired of playing your respectable, boring wife. Stop carrying on! You're so boring, I want to throw up! No, I'm not going in there. - Come on! - No, I'm not going in there. You're pathetic! Why do you want to be with me at all? Stop this now, and come along! Don't touch me! You're disgusting! Scram! You'll need some money. I don't need money from you. Oh, darling... have you waited up for me? That was sweet of you. This fucking dreamboat of a guy... wanted me to go to HIS place. But I wanted to go back to you. So he saw me home instead. Tell me you're not angry! You're not angry? No. You should be happy to see me. Give me that... It's not to you. It's not? But you wrote it, didn't you? It has to be you. Only you could write such nonsense. Now you realise that you love her. What a lot of bullshit she'll have to endure! Fucking hell! When we get home, we'll put an end to it. What? Put an end to what? Put an end to our relationship. So we have a "relationship"? Don't start another argument! I'll argue with you as much as I want. I can spend the rest of my life arguing with you if I wish. No you won't. I'll be going away. I'll be coming back here. We'll see. Maybe I won't let you. Maybe I'll kill you. If I feel like it. "They grieved for the good queen who had died, and the beautiful princess...". Daddy, what school will I go to in England? I don't know. Where were we... ? "who had disappeared." "They grieved over the good king... and the little girl..." Shall I go to pre-school there, too? Yes, of course you will. ..."who would become the princess royal." Did you intend for me to have this blouse? Yes... why...? When would I wear it? When we go to a disco? "She's such a scamp..." "...they whispered." "They asked out loud..." David... Were you really in London? What do you mean? You weren't here with her? Here's the proof. I don't want to check up on you. London. I'm sorry, David! It's as if there was nothing that you could enjoy with me. You're my wife. For me, the most beautiful. Am I really? Hello? Is that you? You haven't left yet? Where are you? At the studio. Vincent is away. I'm coming. I'm coming. So you still remember me. You don't exist any longer. Not for me. No one who doesn't exist can have me. Are you packed ready to go? Have you packed your family as well? How pathetic of her to be packed up whenever you feel like it. - I beg of you... - "Beg?" Why did you come here? You were the one who rang. I just wanted to see if you'd gone. I'd like to stay here forever. Stop that! "I'd like to... I love..." Is it love that's taking you to London for the rest of your life? I don't give a shit if you go, or never come back. Turn around! I said turn around! What are you waiting for? Stay here! Stay with me! Who else can I ring up in the middle of the night? If you love me... I promise I'll love you too. That's why I rang you. I belong to you. I've never belonged to anyone like this. Don't leave me alone! Where were you last night? They rang. She was sick. "She"? I had to drive her to the hospital. What hospital? Sabbatsberg. Why didn't you wake me? I didn't think it'd take so long. I thought I'd be straight back. What's wrong with her then? Appendicitis I think. I'm not really sure. What department is she at? Surgery, I think. - You don't know where you left her? - I told you... surgery! What are you doing? You don't know her name. No matter. There can't be many whores admitted with appendicitis in the middle of the night. Hang up... I was with her all night. Therefore you lied. You've been seeing her the whole time. Are you in love with her? Yes... it's hard to explain. You are such a coward! I thought I could have it out and finish it. I didn't want to bother you more than necessary. Than necessary? So what happens now? Did you think I'd go with you to London? I'm not going to London. You're not going? What?! We're all packed, ready! I changed my mind, last night. Really? At her place? Yes, at her place. I can't leave her here, alone. You're work always comes first. Always has. I've changed. SHE has changed you... That damned slut! Why don't you move in with her? She doesn't have a fixed address. You're not imagining me taking care of you, while you're still seeing her? I don't expect anything. I didn't want this to happen. I didn't want to leave you all. I must have time to think all this through. I don't want to see you. I don't want you living here. Find somewhere else! Get out! After I'd packed everything...! I'm not going away. You're not going? Why not? You wanted me to stay here. We can keep seeing each other if I stay here. This devotion of yours makes me feel sick. I loved you for the simple reason that I knew you were going away. This is horrible. This love of yours scares me. I hate your devoted, soppy love. Go now, David! If you really love me, you'll go. That's what I want. Daddy, why can't I sleep on the floor? But you have a lovely bed. But I want to! Have you finished your wee-wees? So flush the toilet. So... sleep tight! Is that you, David? I'm so scared! I play music, but it doesn't help! Eva? Eva! Don't worry about Eva. She's a deep sleeper. She's like a little kid. Have you known her long? Yes, since she was a little kid! She was always a handful. Ran around with different boys and so on. But I know her so well, I can trust her. Know what I mean? She's a deep sleeper. I rang several times. You needn't worry about her doing any harm to herself. If that's what you were thinking. Damnation! I've come with the wrong key. Only joking! Everything... today as well? How much would that be? How about 150. Where shall I send them? They're for you. For me?! I can't accept that. Of course you can... from me. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
