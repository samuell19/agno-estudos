Thank you, Comrade. Good morning, Comrades. It's good to be back. So, you're back, Comrade. How was Finland? Colder than Moscow, if you can believe it. Alexei Granovski. Expelled, 1978. Present residence Norway. Nikolai Samarin, expelled, 1979. Present residence Madison, Wisconsin. Alexander Menchikov. Defected, 1981. Present residence Los Angeles, California. Yuri Golitsyn. Defected, 1978. Present residence Osaka, Japan. Mikhail Rikov. Expelled, 1980. Present residence Israel. Initial contact by December 20th. Date of operation December 25th. Any background I should know? Well, he's American-born, and his parents died in a car crash just after the war. His only living relation was a grandmother in Dresden, East Germany. That was before they built the wall. She took him and raised him as rebellious as his father. When she died, he came over. - Do we know how? - Not a clue. Too bad he has to do this one. On the contrary, he's perfect for it. It contains a day-by-day record of illegal seizures of torture, official blackmail and so on. And I'm gonna read you some extracts on this little jam on the air. But, first, I wanna bring you up to date on some important dissident activity in the Soviet Union. Now, Michelle, I tell you we're clear to do this story on Sakharov. - Okay. - It's gonna take about five minutes. - Are we rolling, Bob? - Ready when you are. This is Janos, here again, coming to you on Free World Radio. The voice that speaks the truth. You may have noticed in their papers recently, that I'm being called a thief. They're saying I left East Berlin with certain treasures belonging to the government of the Deutschland Democratic Republic. Well, my friends, for once, they speak the truth. I did, in fact, leave the country with certain treasures, One of which is a very interesting and personal diary... What's the Janos bit? That's the name he operated under in Germany. ...it contains a day-by-day record of illegal seizures of torture, of official blackmail and I'm gonna read some extracts from this little gem on the air, but first I wanna bring you up to date... How did he get that kind of shit on the secret police? Well, he came out of East Berlin with a private file belonging to Kurt Limmer. He got it from Limmer's mistress. - The Limmer? - The Limmer. Jesus. Goddamn! My God, you won't be satisfied until you give me a heart attack, will you, old boy? Kind of cold in here, huh? Come on up here, Josh. Come on up here. Come on. Oh, come on. Here we go. Whoops! Come on, you're okay. Getting old. Still wet. It's all right, we're the good guys. You can tell because we usually wash our feet once or twice a week. We were hoping you'd come out on top. You're gonna hope I'm dead if you don't get your goddamn hands off my things. Oh, I was just tidying up. Seemed so disorderly. Yeah, well, you don't live here. Hello, police... He's not liable to interrupt us, is he? Take a look for yourself. Why don't you see to him. Gently. We don't want the French to think we're taking things into our own hands. Hey! We wanna make you a proposition. If I wanted to work for you guys, you'd have heard from me a long time ago. Well, let me put it this way. We need you, and, uh, you need us. Remember how the Bulgarians got Georgi Markov with a poison umbrella? The next time Limmer goes for you, he may not be so obvious. Yeah. You were a big help tonight, I noticed. Well, for an amateur, you were very impressive. Would've been a pity to interfere. The fee we have in mind is $200,000. You could even afford a cleaning woman. Half now and half later. $300,000. I didn't come West to get rich. It may be one of the crosses you'll have to bear. What we want you to do is worth a lot to us. And even more to them. The price of dissidence. Now, what if I tell you, Alex, that five expelled dissidents in different parts of the world, all Russian and in good health, were going to die the same day at exactly the same moment. Nobody would be able to put a finger on how they died. As a dissident, how do you read that? Yes, they let over 14,000 go last year. There's no way we can protect them all. But we know that on Christmas morning, five of them are going to die if we don't find a way to stop it. It will be a Christmas card no dissident will ever be able to forget. But the catch is, we don't know which five or where. That's where you come in. - Bonjour, Monsieur Bodley. - Bonjour. Can I help you? All this trouble for five people. I'm impressed. I don't give a damn if it's five people or 50. If the plan succeeds, it will make us look like fools and make them feared for a generation. And I care a lot about that. You just restored my faith in the system. Our one advantage, Alex, is that what's true inside the curtain, is true outside, too. They only know one way to function. Check, record, document every detail. It's a religion of paperwork. And this is the high altar. The man who's got the key to this, has the key to every move they make. They don't all look like this. Some are voice-controlled and small enough to fit into aircraft. And some are attached to large computers. But this is the heart of them all. What is it, a radio? No, it's a scrambler. The Germans began it before World War II. They called it the Enigma machine. But the silicon chip has made it a different animal. And it jumbles the original message so much that without a similar circuit at the other end, you can spend six months of computer time trying to decipher one message and still get it wrong. But that's only a mock-up. What's it got to do with me? Well, we want you to steal a real one and bring it back before December 25th. Bruno? This way. I think he has some news about your father. - Hi, Karen. - Hi. - Hi, Karen. - Hi. It's probably over-emotional. We'll have to edit it. I'm not worried about that as long as the legal citations are absolutely correct. They are. Bruno told me you had news about my father. They moved him to a hospital outside Berlin. - We're circulating what has happened, but... - I'm not going to let him rot. Neither are we, Karen. But help us, don't push it. Stay out of trouble. Someone you left behind? She may be the main reason I'm going back. Her father was a great teacher but he had a bad habit of telling the truth so they put him away. These are some of his papers, and, uh, you know, if I get lost over there, I want you to make sure they get published. Even if you have to hire a professional writer to polish them up, okay? It's about time you showed up. Well, sorry, Professor. Associate Professor. Now, look, I've taped 16 shows, and I mention the holidays, so, make sure they're played in order. Hmm, the professional. Well, we better take a walk. You got 10 minutes, and these walls are most unreliable. Now, listen to me. These tapes are very carefully marked. If you screw up, I hope they drop the bomb in your living room. Oh, don't worry. The whole world will think you're sick in Paris. I'm not worried about the whole world. I'm worried about all the smiling travel agents at the other end of the line. Stupid. Well, I saw you standing there and I wanted to get in before you dragged me out. - What's up? - Remember Janos? He's coming home. Pardon, monsieur. We know of, uh, four machines not directly under Russian army control. Two in the Russian Embassy. And one in the Cultural Relations Office. Do you know it? In the Centra Building. Yeah, I know it. And the other one is in the MiG at the Russian Air Attache. It's kept under East German guard at a civil airfield. Oh, for Christ's sake. Oh, come on, you know your way around East Berlin. With the balls you've got, the hard part won't be getting it. It will be convincing them that nothing's been taken. Yeah, sure. I just wave my balls around like a magic wand, and it falls in my hand. Then what? These grids are highly sensitive to the power input. If you can short-circuit the main power course, it will burn right through the lot. And they'll end up with something like this. You take the good one out and put this one in its place. And burn out the whole system. They'll never know. And I always thought they were kidding when they said chocolates were bad for you. - Excusez-moi, monsieur. Merci. - Pardon. I never said it would be easy. - What else? - Carry that at the station. And you'll be approached by a woman with a similar chocolate box. If, for some reason, you miss that contact, you go to the restaurant Schiller at 7:00, the day after tomorrow. Au revoir. What do you think could bring him back? I don't know, but those great American idealists in the Pentagon have made a standing offer of a million dollars to anybody who defects with a MiG-25. Maybe he's been sent to give someone the final nudge, but don't count on that. - Do the East Germans know? - No, no, and don't let them. They've been getting a bit touchy about protocol, so, if you need their help, you may have to butter them up a bit, but restrain them. I want that cold dog to be in sufficient health to tell us what he's after. How are things going? Fine, fine. God! That son of a bitch, he's on to something. They've given him a Zim and a chauffeur. - Female? - No. Listen, you get Janos, I get the chauffeur. And you'll get a new clerk, female, that's a promise. You miss him, I'm telling you, we'll both be taking that tram to work. Who's the chief rat catcher around here? Well, Joseph Burseby, but he's played cat and mouse with a lot of people, left a string of empty traps. Just watch me. I'll get him. All passengers have to have their passports stamped. I don't know what's going on there. They just wanna check everybody's papers. Show your passports, okay? Coming through. Excuse me. Everybody from the Chicago-Dresden tour, now, listen to me. We're gonna go through the customs, okay? Watch your backs, please, coming through. Excuse me, madam, danke schon, Comrade, I'll owe you one. Number 18 here. Number 18 here, please. Coming through, excuse me. Herr Limmer. This isn't a mousetrap, it's a barnyard. Well, the peasant genius. And if they've sent you, some man at the Kremlin must think it's important. Limmer, we didn't know you were expecting him, too. No, well, fortunately, we're not solely dependent on Russian security for all our information. We actually wanted to handle it quietly. At least, until we find out what it is he's after, but then, perhaps this is just to impress the tourists with what a friendly place this is. Oh, don't worry, we'll find out what he was after. - You're sure he's on that train? - Quite sure. Follow me, please. It's the brown suitcase. - Ah. - And, my wife's is the next one. Yes. Oh, no. No, thank you. You know the rules about tipping. Take them away. Apprehend every porter. I'll check the locker room. If I were you, I'd seal the station and check everyone. Soldier, over here! Come on! Room for one more. Uh, here. Uh, excuse me, please. Thank you. Oh, very scientific, Limmer. A particular science we learned from the KGB. Since she's still alive, I take it she said something. You were pursuing Holbeck. Now, when we've questioned him, we'll accede to your reading the transcript. But, by that time, I hope we'll be in receipt of an official request to admit you to the case. Hirsch. Are you suggesting that the comrade... I'm suggesting that possession of a certain literature is not necessarily an act of defiance against the State. It's more a matter of intellectual curiosity. And a measure of the need for independence we all held at that age. Defense council is right, the feelings are normal. But the test of citizenship is one's willingness to subject them to the good of all. Something the defendant had better learn sooner than later. Six months. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. Heinrich Allender. The State versus Heinrich Allender and Maria Stonefeld. The charge is drunken disorderly and resisting arrest, Your Honor. At 3 p.m. on November 18th, the defendant was apprehended by patrolman Hankau in the middle of Boulevard Fredricksen after a collision between a tram and military truck. Both drivers allege that the defendant was wandering in and out of heavy traffic... Are you insane? I wanted to see you. Oh, come on, we've done more dangerous things than this. A lot of people may recognize the voice, but only old friends know the face. What do you want? I need a safe house for 24 hours. Are you working for the Americans, or is this just you? I can't tell you. It's the same place. I'll be there after 5:00. Okay. Thank you. ...wandering in and out of heavy traffic. Dimitri! - Hey! - Come up. Our office is up here. Hey, Konstantin. - It's good to see you. - This way. You look great, eh. You haven't changed. In here. One problem is that no one on our side has ever seen him face-to-face. But I can tell you this, the East Germans are getting more sensitive and independent every day. - And this one they want badly. - Me, too. Listen, I wanna hear all his broadcasts, as many as you've got taped. And get together every bit of gossip you can find about him. Well, this is the only picture we have of him. Did he give away his own name, or did they finally find it? Well, once Janos started broadcasting from Free World Radio, they recognized his voice. He'd been a state radio announcer on the current affairs channel. - Lived alone? - Not very often. Just give me a moment. I'm still not much of a hausfrau. - That depends on what you want a hausfrau for. - Hmm. It's all right. I made sure I wasn't being followed. I'm not sure they aren't following me. Why? - What are you doing here? - I was homesick. You haven't changed much. Still throwing things at me. Uh... I missed you. You left me before you left Berlin. And you haven't come back for me. Maybe not. I can't tell you what I'm doing back here now, but, I know you'd approve. I wrote to you. It was hand-carried to Vienna. Oh, yeah. About your father. Not the next broadcast, but the one after. So, you are going back. Yeah, but not right away. I, um... I'm meeting somebody tomorrow night who's gonna help me. I don't wanna put you in any danger, but, I have wanted to see you. Hmm, and several others. No. I'm really glad I came. Waiting for someone? Just come quietly. Stop! Stop! Get in the car. I want this whole area sealed off. I don't want a cat or a mouse to get in or out. You know what to do. Proceed. Stop! Stop! Look, that man is running away. Quick, after him! - Anything? Try to seal it off again. - No. Okay. He's got to be somewhere. I want a bigger circle. Spread the men. Turn these buildings inside out. Post a man in the warehouse round the back. - Yes, sir. You, come with me. They knew you were coming back to Berlin. When I got home, Margaret was here. She sleeps with a Russian from the Embassy. - Does she count that as moving up in the world or down? - Shut up. She said they sent a KGB man from Moscow especially for you. Did she say who it was? I couldn't be too curious. But she said he's supposed to be the best. Dimitri somebody. He's young, goes to the Sports Palace every day. - Dimitri? - Vasilikov. My God, how do the Russians know, too? I'm gonna have to find another place. With Margaret dropping by, who knows who'll be next. I want to help. Whatever it is. - No. - Risk it. Admit you need someone. One danger at a time, please. Hey, don't worry about me. I've got friends in places you wouldn't dream. Oh, God damn you! Don't push me. - Don't push me, you little shit! - Shut up. Get in. - No... - Quiet! Quiet! Just relax, please. They've been here already. They'll come back again. All right, listen, Yuri, you gotta help me. I need a place to stay. They know who you are, Alex. It's not like before. You're crazy. Crazy! Relax. Alex. You were doing so much good with the broadcast. Why did you come back? Comrade Vasilikov. Good of you to see me, Minister. I was given the courtesy of an audience at the Russian Embassy this morning I was told of your great concern about this... This man, Holbeck. Now, as you know, we hold firmly to the general principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations... Can I have some sugar? Minister... Comrade Limmer has had two opportunities of capturing this man. And despite a massive display of force in each instance, the man escaped. Now, this is what concerns our ambassador. Minister, if you are prepared to grant me supervision of this case, I will promise not to bring in any other personnel, and, furthermore, when Holbeck is captured, he'll be turned over to you as soon as we've finished questioning him. It would seem a crime to jeopardize the long friendship between our two nations over the rather trivial issue of Comrade Limmer's competence. I did enjoy our coffee. Thank you both. Just find out. - Find out why he would come back. - Again. What are you looking for? Take it off. Or we will. The rest. I would like to ask you again what you know about Alexander Holbeck. Anything? Nothing. Well, perhaps, we picked the wrong man. Ah, you could've never given it to a regular. Why don't they clean around here? What's wrong with this place? What the hell is he doing? I want fewer guards, not more. And I want every MiG available out on the tarmac. - I will not take the responsibility... - I will. You've got to offer him the right bait or he'll never come out of his hole. Make sure none of those MiGs can fly. You're missing a hairpin. Professor Reinhardt is also a man whose first belief was in the dignity of human life. No man should have to grovel for food, for work, for justice. But, like many honest men, he, too, could be deceived by men who use words as sneak thieves use the cover of night. They count it their achievement to have stolen him from us, to have put him away. But his life has already proved the truth about human dignity. And their acts have proved why it is worth fighting for. Until next time, this is Janos on Free World Radio. The voice that speaks the truth. Auf wiedersehen. So, what's the good Mr. Limmer found? Not a pimple out of place. He pulled in a lot of people, but he found damn all. What I do think you should know is that he's got a camera in your office. - Has he? - And he's using two lists, his own and yours. - We're assigned to his. - Poor Limmer. He's got two enemies. The Cowboy and the Cossack. I think I ought to let him know just who's the more dangerous. Everybody take coffee. Now. Move! Am I to be told what all this is about? Well, we thought she was a lead. She was someone he knew once. We were wrong. I question all leads first. You'll end up on a pig farm hauling shit with your delicate hands if you cross me again. And next time you're tempted to play red fox, you play this film back in your office. - What's the matter? Something happened? - No. I heard your broadcast. Thanks. Nah, you're just very partial on that subject. Karen, I hate to push you, but I need some help. If it's against them, you don't even have to ask. Is there anyone you know we can trust? A few. Students of my father. Are they watching your apartment? Not anymore. Midnight, then. I'm not talking about... What did she look like? I want to be the one. I have the right to be the one. You know, it's really great in here. Yeah, just like water. Seems strange they'd let you go on an open permit. Labor is scarce right now. Well, I'm not very fast, you know. But I'm strong enough. Feel that arm. All right, but I warn you. Any trouble, and it goes on your record. I'll take you to the warehouse. They'll tell you what to do. My car's just over there. I'll tell you what, I'll race you to see which of us can swim there first. Hmm? Well, you're right, I'd probably cheat, anyway. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll bring the car over here and you won't even have to get your hair wet, all right? All right? Thank you. If I start thinking about you, I won't be able to do it. What's he like? Unsophisticated but shrewd. Very sure of himself. Is he gonna pick you up here? I said we'd meet at the pool. I don't want him here. - If I'm gonna whore, I'm not gonna whore here. - You don't have to whore. Look, we'll get somebody else. No, it's not that easy. Can't you just, you know, lead him on? I'm gonna do what's necessary. I'll take you next time. - Everybody, drinks on me. - He's crazy. This German beer is not as strong as vodka. Problem is, you need some stronger opposition at arm wrestling. Who is he, anyway? Oh, he works... ...where I work. Where's that? Except the fact that you swim and arm-wrestle, I don't know much about you. I'm a Cultural Affairs Officer. Oh, really? More or less, really. I didn't know Cultural Affairs Officers were so strong. Russian ones are. Oh. It's not the beer, you know, it's you. I get dizzy and I feel the whole world is where you are. You better go back to vodka. I tell you true. I wanted you because I saw you in a bathing costume. Now, three days later, if you told me I could only see your eyes, nothing more ever, I would say it doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter at all. He can't just have disappeared in the middle of Berlin. In any big city, you can disappear. Now, doing something's a different matter. We don't want him to do something. The pressure we applied would cost us plenty if he outsmarts you. Look... Don't you think you can just wipe it off as a failed case? - Neither of us can. - Look, I know him. He'll make his move his way and I'll get him. Now, waiting is the difficult part. But I've got everything vital in this city covered. But you haven't found him! You don't know what he's here for. He'll tell me what he's here for. - Bullshit! - He will! He'll have come on as a different guy. Maybe two guys. I've studied him. He's a chameleon, that's why we can't find him. But it will start with a woman. Someone close to a leading official, and, believe me, I've got them all covered. There's not one affair in this town that I... What is it? I've got him. The address is 11, Friedrichstrasse. Age, between 27 and 30. About 5'6". She claimed to be a school teacher, temporarily unassigned. And, Konstantin, on no account is there to be any hint of an investigation, even if it takes a week. Nothing. But the minute you know, I want to know. Do they have Christmas trees in Russia? Of course they have Christmas trees. And presents? Presents on Twelfth Nights. My mother told me never to trust a Russian. We have giant Christmas trees. And on January the 6th, Grandfather Frost comes with ice skates, and sleds and dolls. Something for everyone except for cynical girls who don't believe. Even during Stalin's time? Did the Germans had Christmas even during Hitler's time? People get warped ideas about each other. You know, where I come from, they always used to talk about German women. Rhinemaidens everywhere luring men to distraction. I must be careful not to lure you into anything. They say the Russian that comes to Germany loses his head or his heart. Either way, fatal. My grandparents were peasants. And my parents. And if it wasn't for the Revolution, I'd have been one, too. You're not that old. I come from a collective farm, and I won a scholarship. Well, your peasant's heart learned all the evils of the past. And pretended not to see the evils of the present. Maybe there is evil today. But it isn't like it was. Now, it's only the stupid and the blind who think there isn't as much evil around the corner or over the wall. Or across the sea. December 17th. Only eight days left and not a bloody word. Is there anything more we could do? Not without risking everything. - Could I go in? - No. No regular man can. Turn that thing off. Listen, Bruno thinks he can get us some help. But, I'm running out of time. I need to know what our Russian friend is planning. He wants me to move in with him. I'm not asking you to go that far. I've already gone that far. I had to. He's not a fool. I couldn't play with him and keep his confidence. If I... If I could, uh, get something, you know, concrete, by December 20th, is that possible? Yes. - Alex... - I have to get back to work now. I'm sure it was the only way. I'll have you moved in by the time you find the soup bowls. You even get the top drawer. Vasilikov. Her real name is Reinhardt. She was Holbeck's girl for over two years. Her father's a leading dissenter. He's in a psychiatric hospital. She's a lawyer in a Magistrate's Court. I'm sorry. Bad news? You know the old expression, "Lucky in love when lucky in work." We've been waiting for you. What are you gonna do? Listen, we need your decisions and we need them now. This is most urgent. Why should we take that kind of risk without knowing what it's for? Because if I tell you, and just one person gets caught, it'll all be for nothing. Wait. And, uh... Uh, of course, our Lord demonstrated not only his approval of matrimony but also his approval of good wine. - To the bride and groom. - Bride and groom. Cheers. - Are they gone? - Yes. Does Karen know what it's for? No, not all of it. I'm the only one that does. Is it for the Americans? We know how they were going to make the world safe for human rights. But you know me, and you know you can trust me. And if we won't? Then, I'll just have to try it on my own immediately. It's too important. Okay. Okay. Well, some of this, it has come from the Copenhagen exhibit. It will go directly to today. We'll check it in the morning. - How are they doing? - Quite good. Okay. Why be so subtle? If she knows what he's after, I'll bet we could find out in half a day. No! Look, if she doesn't know, we've lost the contact. She gets more nervous every day. About the only thing she's reacted to at all, and then I'm not sure, is the mention of MiGs. Well, if you risk that, you better have all your tracks covered. Don't worry, I'll set a trap he'll never escape. Alex, I'm a genius, no? Ah, so, this is Comrade Reinhardt. Well, Alex, the West hasn't corrupted all your senses. Quickly. He's the only friend I got no one knows about. I think I have what you want. All military units are taking part in the parade, Sunday. It's supposed to be accounted to Christmas. - Did he tell you that? - No. I found it in his papers. Sunday's the 22nd. That's when we'll do it. If that's all you want... Let me leave him now. No, no, not yet. You can't. It would spoil everything. He'll probably get called out early on Sunday. So, after he leaves, I want you to go to the Folk Museum. Girth will meet you there. I'll be along later. And, uh, you're gonna have to come West with me, whether you want to or not. What about my father? Well, if we make enough noise, there's a good chance they'll deport him. And we'll make enough noise. I promise you. I want to hate him. I want to. But, there's something inside me, he's... ...taking hold of. We followed her to her hairdresser's. She was inside for half an hour. We ran the check. Her fingerprints are all over the papers about Sunday's parade. Bodley said he'd have those five names a week ago. - He's been trying. - Well, you gentlemen aren't paid for trying. The Secretary of State wants that information. He doesn't wanna have to plead with military intelligence to get it. The Russians have stopped using their signal machine. They have reason to believe that we have their scrambler. Well, who the hell let that out? I don't know, somebody got overeager. Now, we've gotta save those five people. Don't worry, when they start transmitting again, we'll get the names. Bodley sent a guy in to get a Russian scrambler from a station in East Berlin. We've already got a scrambler. What we want is to... Now, wait, you mean, someone is going to try to steal one to convince them we haven't got it? That's it. That's a pretty delicate piece of footwork. Not really. Our guy doesn't know that we already have the scrambler. And he doesn't know that we set him up with the Russians and East Germans. Is he one of your own agents? No, he's a defector. He's been working for Free World Radio. God, I hate this business. Well, when he makes his move we'll get him. And you'll get your names. I'd better. - I'm told you have him. - Not quite correct. But, I believe he's going to try and take a MiG 25 on Sunday. Is that... ...possible? There was only to be a token force on duty. We have to lure him into the trap. Now, all the troops must leave the field as planned. But I want you to bring in two companies of paratroopers from Meissen. Undercover, no orders issued. And they'll stand by on every building on the field, and then Limmer will line the route to the field with security police. For one man? For one man. Are you leaving so early? Mmm-hmm. When you've just shaved and your hair is combed tight like that, I could believe you're a peasant. When I leave, you must get dressed. There are two security policemen waiting for you outside. If it wasn't all a game... I'm sorry it ended this way. I'll be in the car. Give me a radio check - every 10 minutes. - Yes, Comrade. I just heard Karen's been taken by the Security Police. I know. We gotta keep moving. Put those bottles in the box. The parade's half-over. What the hell else can he have been after? 17... Come in, 17. - This is 17, what's happening? - Limmer here. We have a report that students are attacking the Soviet Embassy. Do you hear me, Vasilikov? Yes, how many? And what sort of protection do they have? Except for two clerks and two security men, they say all embassy staff are either in the parade or on the viewing stands. Well, what about your men? They are either on the airport or covering the parade. I don't have an army! There are four ordinary policemen on duty for all the embassies this morning. That's it? He's after the signal system, the scrambler. Move! The embassy! They were wrong, they never had the damn thing after all. Limmer, pull out your men from the airport. Get them back on the embassy. Seal off the entire section. No traffic, no pedestrians. Nothing moves through it. - Paratroopers? - They stay at the airport, and, by God, they stay alert. Stop those two. Hold them! - Have they been in the communications room? - Never, it's locked. - Andrei would blow it first. - Take care of those two. - Hey, where's the fire? - What? Look, one of you people called in a fire, so there had better be one. Come with me. - What's the matter? - There's a fire. You go outside and give him a hand. I'll look around. Let's go. Look! Stay here. Keep everyone out. I'll get the other guards. Hey! Get outside and keep everyone away from the building. We gotta shut off the gas. Go on, move! What a brilliant operation. And so economical of manpower. I'm sure that I could never have managed it on my own. Take them downstairs. It has to be something else. It has to be something other than a student demonstration. Check the airport again. Check with your headquarters. Of course. Vasilikov! There's nothing, the city's quiet. There's a small fire burning in the Centra Building. But the police have no report of it yet. Okay, Bruno, now! He knew I was on to her. Knew I expected him to plant her. He's played me like a trained bear. Let's go downstairs, I got one more job. Come on, quicker than that. Get back. Get back, there. Get back. Stop anyone who comes out. Anyone. I wouldn't go in there. The gas hasn't been turned off yet. Don't worry about me. Ask these two. They were the first ones to get here. Hey, you! Come here. Come here, move it. Open the box. Come on, open it. Turn around, spread it. Come here. Turn around. Hey, what are you doing to my man? We have a fire here. What the hell... That's not my man. - Stop that man. - No! Go! Get out of the way. Move! Pass! Let us through. Get out of the way! Come on! Don't be a fool. They outsmarted themselves. By starting the fires, they burned out the circuitry. By the time they got it open it was useless. I wonder if it's not just another decoy... What was he after? What did he really get? It was something in his eyes, he... He hated me, but it was... It was as though he'd won. Comrade, I don't think this is our circuitry. What do you mean? It's close, but the pattern is just not right. It's not our scrambler. Contact Limmer. All the checks have got to be tightened now. The airport, the station, the roads, the lot. He'll be trying to move before we do. I have one idea. One. She was a violent patient, do you understand? It was necessary to calm her. She was a ward of court. The instructions were quite clear. - There is someone else... - It's always someone else. If you stop calming her, how soon can I talk to her? With luck, 24 hours. Of course, there would still be areas where... As a favor, you try. We are always willing to cooperate. How long is she in for? Indefinitely. Thanks, Yuri. Now, what about the security passes? Your name is Heinrich Oxberger. The cab will be at the same place at the same time. Okay. I better run. You know what to do with this. Say, you know, uh... I might not see you again. If I get drunk enough, I'll pray for you. Well, it's two hours late already. We can't keep this up forever. You should see what's going on at the airport. It's worth a try. Uh, you stay close to our colleague. Uh, good evening, Fraulein. My name is Oxberger, from security. And there's an emergency investigation in progress, so I'll need to look at the admission records from the last three days, please. - I'm not authorized. - Well, who is? You'd have to see the duty doctor. - Will you go and get him, then, please? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. I'll wait here. - Yes. Reinhardt. Here. Karen Reinhardt, got it. Karen. Karen... Hold me. Please, hold me. Come on, we gotta go now. No. - I can't go. - No, no, it's okay. - I can't. - Yes, you can. You see, it's official, I'm in charge now. Okay? Come on, let's go. It's all right. - Alex... - Yes, it's me, Alex. But it's all right. It's all right, love. Come on, we gotta go now. Come on. - No... - No, it's okay, come on. No, no. I'm the doctor. Come on. Karen, no, it's all right. She's innocent! - You're taking her! - No, no, everything's okay. My God. AND GIBBERING) Get off of me! Get off of me! Don't be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just trust me. - I don't wanna... - No, it's warm. Trust me. Hang on. Now, cold. Hang on. Now, hot. Now, cold. Stay with it. Now, hot. Doctor, can I have your attention? - The Reinhardt patient is missing. - Can't you see we are busy? - Some have locked each other in, maybe. - No. She may be downstairs. Some of them ran there. They're opening doors on the second floor. Well, leave them to the orderlies. You two, come with me. I thought you were in jail or gone forever. Can't get rid of me that easy. Besides, the way I live, you never know, I might need a lawyer someday. I love you. I never realized how much till I saw you upstairs. Down here. Come on, come on. Split up. You go that way. What are you doing here? Let me through. I insist on being... Have you any idea who I am? I said stop this. Get that thing off me! Let me go! You'll be in great trouble. I assure you, you'll be in great trouble. Let me go! Let me out! No! What? Canarsky's arriving in a few hours. You're officially relieved of duty as of noon. In the interim, you shall make your apologies to the Ministry of Security. And Limmer, if he shows up. The worst of it is I still don't know how he did it. I don't think those students can tell. I doubt if Janos told them anything. Look, at least you can be satisfied it didn't happen over something trivial. Yes, one shipment. We have an exhibit opening, in Zurich, the 28th. It's been boarded this morning. All right, come with us. But... What the... Listen, I hope someone is gonna pay dearly for this. Don't worry. Someone will. The train for Zurich is delayed by 20 minutes. Dimitri. That's new. - Give me the knife. - What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it! You haven't got the right to do that. Russian barbarians! Just a minute. Put your bags back on the table. What's this all about? We just went through customs. We're Americans, you know. Passports. Open them. What is this? Souvenir. Twenty-four marks. Incredible. A steal. Looks like an original. You know, you take this into any art gallery, you could substitute this one for this one, and no one would ever know. Couldn't you? And you intended to go from Budapest to Zurich? To the victor the spoils. You have to leave this behind. It requires a permit. You'd better catch your train. I think these two go together. Merry Christmas. You're too easy. See this goes back where it belongs. He's a very unusual man. Yes. Well... We failed. It's the first time in my life I hate Christmas. "Message intercept. 04:15, KGB Headquarters. "Following stations to confirm escape arrangements for agents "detail to operation December 25th." Well, that's it. That's it. It worked. It all worked. It was all worth it.
