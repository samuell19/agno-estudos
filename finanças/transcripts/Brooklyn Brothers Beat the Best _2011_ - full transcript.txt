[ Sighs ] What? Been meaning to tell you for a while now. We've only played three shows. How long could it have been? I guess we'll just have to... agree to disagree. Doesn't even make sense in this situation. Well, we're definitely gonna have to agree to disagree... on that. What? [ Sighs ] This is what I'm talkin' about, man. We're always arguing. You're just-- You're just too negative. And... your lyrics, dude. There ain't nothin' sexy about moths, man. Nothing. You sing about monsters and shit. You just-- You don't get it. It's not about monsters. All my shit is autobiographical. How do you think I wrote "Vampire Soul-Suckin' Slut"? You think that just came to me? That shit, like, happened to me, man. Music is like an exorcism, dude. Give me one more chance. Look, this is my third band this year. Look, I-- I'll write a song about an exorcism. It's gotta be autobiographical, man. You've never been exorcised. Wait. Have you been exorcised? No. I'm gonna head east. I'm really nervous about you killing yourself, man. You don't have any, like... pills on you or anything, do you? No. Damn. I'm just so stressed out from telling you all that stuff. Nothing? All right. You know, you gotta be a man... if you're gonna play the music of a man, bro. And don't kill the messenger on this one, but if I were you, I'd look into some voice lessons too. ♪♪ [ Guitar: Folk Strumming ] Peace out, G.

It makes sense. [ Laughing, Chattering ] Well, look who's here. I'm really sorry I'm late, Jack. I had a bad night, and I forgot my alarm, and I didn't have money for a cab, so-- Alex, you don't have money for a cab... because you haven't closed a deal in weeks. And your bullshit love life has no place in this office. - Oh! - Come on. [ Men Laughing ] Ten for 10. You saw it. Jason, do you mind if you give us a moment alone for a second? Oh, right. No problema. I'll just be in my office. Jack, I promise you, I'm good. All right, kid. Pull yourself together. We powwow in 10, then go after these fuckers like ninja assassins. [ Phone Buzzes ] [ Phone Snaps Shut ] Jack, horrible timing-- [ Chuckles ] but I was wondering if I could maybe take my lunch hour just a little bit early. Look, I have a gig, and I cannot be late. Jesus, you gotta stop calling 'em gigs. When you equate meaningless bullshit to your goals, you're setting yourself up for failure. [ Jason ] Amen. Still on our private moment here, Jason. Thank you very much. You got it, dog. No. Final answer. We go in 10. [ Water Pouring ] [ Jason ] Put the water down! Water is for closers. What? You think I'm fucking with you? Huh? [ Laughs ] Just fucking with you, man. That was from Glengarry Glen Ross, bitch. You're too easy to get, son. [ Chuckles ] - Jack is right though, man. - You know what, Jason? Seriously? I mean, being an artist... is kinda like playing checkers, man. There's only a couple of ways you can move, and you're either a king or you're nothing. And there's only room for a few kings in music. I mean, there's Elvis, Michael Jackson... and probably Weird Al Yankovic. But in adult jobs-- like real estate, for example-- we're playing chess. Yeah. Sometimes you move forward, sometimes diagonal. Maybe sometimes you're moving in an "L" shape like the horsey guys. Little kids play with checkers, Alex, while old Russian dudes and homeless black men... looking to outfox unsuspecting tourists-- Now, they-- They play chess. A.K.A., put the water down... and grow some fuckin' sacks. [ Jack ] What the hell is the matter with you? What? What? You could've broken his neck. He caught it. You threw a five-gallon water bottle at his face, Alex. The entire office is flooding. You know what that shit's gonna cost me? You know what? Y-You're done. I'm sorry. Go. Play your gig. I will.

We understood? It was self-defense. I had no idea it was a fake knife. You hit a handicapped kid repeatedly in the face! You're lucky you're not in jail, you little... shit sack! [ Man ] I'm gonna need your pin. [ Children Laughing, Chattering ] I like your pink skin. It's pretty. Can I ask you something? Okay. Do you like your life? I don't know. I think so. Can you explain that to me please, kid? How do you do that? I mostly just play a lot. Have you tried playing? Nobody wants me to play, man. [ Sniffles ] I remember this one time. I was 10 years old, and I played this song in front of my whole school. - It was about swans, I think. - I love swans. Right? I love swans. It was about this swan that-- It's told its whole life that it's beautiful, but then one day it grows up and it realizes, "Yo, I'm an ugly duckling." And my teachers thought it was morbid. And a bunch of kids wrote "Alex is a pussy" on my guitar case... and called me "duck boy" for like-- for like fucking years. What am I supposed to do? My mama says I can do anything I want when I grow up. I could tell that from the first second I saw you. That's something all musical mooses can tell. It's our one gift. Really? Come on, Jenny. Leave the nice man alone. I'm not man. I'm a moose. [ Woman ] Get a job, asshole. [ Phone Buzzing ] [ Buzzing Continues ] [ Alex Sniffles ] Hello, Erin. Hi, Alex. Hey. It's great to hear your voice. Are you okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm doing great. How are you? Your message sounded really scary. Oh, no. No, I'm-- I'm good. I just, you know-- I've been up to-- [ Sniffles ] I've been doing so much stuff. I mean noth-nothing necessarily like important... or like pertinent but-- Oh, my God. I cannot believe this. From the show last night. I'm sorry about your band, Alex. What? I said I'm sorry about your band. No, no. You don't understand. I was sitting over there and I was thinking, and now you're here. I know it meant a lot to you. I mean, come on, this is crazy. - Can you-- Can you please leave me alone? - What? No, not you. I understand if you don't wanna talk. I just need a second. Don't be a dick. Listen to me. I don't know who you think you are or why you're harassing me right now, but you better stop because I'm about to freak the fuck out. Not a good time? Get away from me! Alex? Alex, are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. I was just-- No. Actually, no, I-- No, I'm not okay. Have you talked to Brian? What? No. Why would I do that? Come on, Erin, don't-- Don't say stupid shit like that. He's your brother, Alex. I know this is gonna sound awful, but have you thought about going home for a little while? It's really helped me clear my head. You know what would have helped me, Erin? Not being betrayed and left for dead by my girlfriend. That would've helped me a lot. Hey. Hey. I need to talk to you right now. This cannot wait. Get away from-- Uh-- Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. It's okay, buddy. You okay? Okay. I'm sorry. Hey. Whoa. Are you all right, man? Who are you, and why are you in my apartment? We should start a band together. I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna start yelling rape really loud over and over again. I already planned out a whole tour. One. We leave tomorrow, so we gotta work fast. Wait a minute. I know you. - You punched me in the face. What the-- - Aaah! How do you know where I live? It's okay. Look at that, license. Mmm, mmm. Yum. Take it. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Holy shit. A map. I plotted out our whole course. It takes two weeks to go from one coast to the other. I booked all the dates. All we gotta do is show up. All we have to do is show up? And then at the end, there's a big final competition, a big band battle. A battle of the bands. Well put. We're gonna win it, of course. How amazing would that be? I mean-- Aaah! [ Both Laugh ] It would be-- Yeah, except for one thing. Fuck. What? [ Both Shouting ] - [ Both Grunting ] - [ Alex ] How do you even know I play music? Because I was at the show last night. You stole my slot. [ Screeching ] If you already have a band, what do you need me for? - Don't you worry about it. Don't worry-- - [ Alex Screams ] Look, I know you got drop-kicked out of your old band. - I didn't get drop-kicked. - I heard you got thrown like a fucking javelin. You got tossed like a little side salad. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. I can't write songs, okay? I'm a musical revolutionary who doesn't need to write songs. So I don't write songs, okay? You got that? [ Both Grunting ] People don't want me in their band because I'm too fuckin' interesting. Well, fuck them. But I booked this whole-- this whole tour over this whole month, only to find out that I've been secretly replaced... by that fucking tool from your old band... who writes songs about werewolves raping each other. But no one told me because they didn't-- they didn't want me to un-book the tour. But then when they found out that your guy was playing, then they all just-- they all just fucking bailed. [ Alex ] So what do you expect me to do? Go with you, a complete stranger, and drive across the country tomorrow? Well, I figure we're the scraps-- which is awesome... because all great music was made by a bunch of scraps, you know? What did J.F.K. say? What, ask not what your country can-- No. Are you talking about the moon speech? No, he said, "Well, geez, Jackie. This is sure a swell Cadillac. Hey, isn't that"-- [ Imitates Gunshot ] Do, do, do, do, do, do-- [ Imitates Thud, Explosion ] If he would've lived one more minute, he would have told all the children of the world... not to waste the precious time that we have left. We're gonna be in California in two weeks. I've never been. Have you? I'm not going to California. I have to get a job. I just ended a very important relationship. I'm sad. I punched a retarded kid in the face, and now I have no way of paying for this apartment. But here's the part that concerns you. I suck. [ Chuckles ] Okay? I'm no good. So if you'll please excuse me, intruder, pretty please with sugar on top, get the fuck out of my apartment. All right. I'm gonna go. Great. Good-bye, Alex. How the hell do you know my name? It's on your license. And it's also on your guitar case. [ Paper Rustling ] I'm just gonna-- [ Door Opens, Closes ] Of course he's from Jersey. [ Phone Buzzing ] [ Buzzing Continues ] Hello, Erin? [ Woman ] Hello, this is Marleen. I'm calling about your delinquent phone-- [ Phone Buzzing ] [ Buzzing Continues ] [ Buzzing ] [ Grunts ] [ Buzzing Continues ] [ Static ] Hello? Hello? Hello? Erin, can you hear me? [ Man ] How you doing, little brother? Hey, Brian. Great. I'm doing really good. That's not the word around the campfire, chief. You in some kind of trouble, Ali? Brian, I was-- I was wondering if it would be all right with you-- I mean, if-- I think it'd be a good idea. It'd be great to see you. Bet that city can really swallow you up. Music's not going anywhere, Alex. What do you mean? I just mean that your music will always be there whenever you want it. It's not going anywhere. It's a hard lesson to learn, but there's nothing wrong with knowing when to say enough. You there, Ali? No. I mean, yes. I mean, um-- Brian, actually the reason I was calling you is that I was-- I was wondering if it would be cool if I just stayed for-- with you for a night or two because, um-- You're gonna think this is crazy. [ Chuckles ] I'm only coming because I'm planning my revenge on you for punching me in the face. You're not gonna know when it's coming. You're not gonna know where it's coming from. You might not even notice it when it's here. In fact, for all you know, it already happened. But shit is going down, and you will feel my fucking wrath. [ Whispering ] Yes. [ Snoring ] [ Snoring Continues ] Pretty cool, huh? Jesus. Yeah. I feel like I just walked into a preschool version of the movie Hostel. - [ Screams ] - Aaah! [ Laughing ] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had to do that. [ Squawking, Electronic Beeping ] [ Squawking, Beeping Intensifies ] [ Tones Oscillating ] - [ Mimics Speech ] - [ Gasps ] Will you shut your stupid-ass, cocksucking mouths in there? - Sorry, Grandpa. - Go fuck yourself. He had a stroke recently, so he pretty much says whatever he wants. - I'm closing the door. - Go fuck yourself again. Okay. [ Chuckles ] All right. We got about three hours before we gotta hit the road... or we're not gonna make that show tonight. So let's grab this shit and let's get going. [ Sniffs ] You're bringing all this stuff? Nah. Just the classics. [ Alex ] Don't we need, like, a van or something? Oh, it's only the two of us, and we don't have that much stuff. Plus, we need something that gets disgustingly high gas mileage, or we're gonna end up dead somewhere. [ Alex ] So your grandpa's just cool with us taking his car? Yeah, he lost his license a while ago. Although if he knew we were taking it, he'd hunt us down and shoot us in the street like dogs. He was a Green Beret. He loves this car. [ Engine Sputters, Dies ] [ Alex ] So, what do I do? I'll play a beat and then you play along. And I'll record it. And then we'll switch it up, okay? Wait. Did you take lessons? No. You? No. No, me neither. Great. That's good, because then we're both homegrown talents. It's better that way. Okay. ♪♪ [ Electronic Drumbeats ] All right, quick warning.

You said the dates were set. I don't understand why we have to convince anybody of anything. Dates were set, but I had to cancel a few things 'cause my band got hijacked. Been on the phone nonstop, piecing this thing back together. I just hit a little snag with this one. Playing a little phone tag. Don't worry. I am on really, really good terms with the girl that books the bands at this club. What the fuck do you want? Hi, Cassidy. It is so nice to finally meet you. I agreed to meet you here, Jim, because "A," it's a well-lit public place, and "B," to let you know I've looked into it, and the 20 voice mails and countless e-mails you've sent me... does, in fact, constitute harassment. If I ever receive another ounce of correspondence from you, I will have you behind bars getting ass-raped by nightfall. The show's full. So what the fuck do you want? Absolutely nothing. It was really nice meeting you. We're gonna go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I haven't had a chance to introduce you to Alex. Songwriter genius. Yes. And this is Cassidy. Young entrepreneur, music enthusiast. This is really cool, you guys. The two of you-- meeting here like this? This is great. What are you doing here? [ Jim ] You are not gonna like it. And to be perfectly honest, I-I was against it myself at first. But Alex here would not be denied the opportunity... to explain to you why this show... would be an absolute shell of what it could be... without the Brooklyn Brothers. - Who are the Brooklyn Brothers? - You're looking at them. Can you excuse me for a second? We didn't talk about the band being called the Brooklyn Brothers. Why? You don't like it? No, it's just that we're not brothers. - That doesn't make sense. - It's the appeal factor. Trust me. - We could be blood brothers. I got a pocketknife. - What? Jim, listen to me. Don't you think the Brooklyn Brothers sounds like a black funk band from the '70s? If by that you mean it sounds like we got soul, then yeah, I do. You guys are so strange. Him, not me. I'm-- I am totally normal. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he's totally normal. I found him in the park dressed as a pink unicorn. Moose. It was-- It was a-- It was a musical moose. Musical moose. I played music for retar-- for handi-- mentally handicapped children. They fucking love music, okay? Well, that's kind of sweet. Till he punched one in the face. Uh-oh. That is not completely true. Oh, forgot to mention that. There was a knife. I mean, it was fake. This guy is the Jeffrey Dahmer of the stuffed animal world. No, this guy. You should see what this guy-- Okay, shut up! Oh, my God, I should be shot in the face for even thinking this, but... I'm morbidly curious as to what you sound like. Yeah, we're doing a Gloria Estefan meets GWAR thing. [ Alex, Cassidy ] What? I'm kidding. Are you guys for real? [ Jim ] Yeah, Cassidy. Real as syphilis. Okay, I'm gonna need you to stop talking to me now, Jim. Okay? Talking to Alex. - Hi. - Hi. And you are doing this with him? I-I-- Yeah, I guess so. Okay. Be at the venue at 8:30. Don't be late. I could kiss you right now. I could swing on you, Jim. So help me God. Then I wouldn't kiss you.

[ Chuckles ] You're an interesting songwriter. Sad. But interesting. So you guys have a place to crash or what? Forty-five. Forty-five dollars. Counted it three times. Boom. [ Birds Twittering ] [ Car Door Shuts ] Morning. Whoa, nice panties. Hey, what are you-- What are you doing with the bag? Oh, I decided I'm coming with you. [ Chuckles ] Wait, what? See, the crazy thing is, I've actually never been outside of Pennsylvania. [ Chuckles ] Oh, except for this one time when I was 10... and we went to New York on a field trip. Anyways, I figured it's about time I start seeing stuff, you know? Besides, you guys need me. Okay, first of all, don't need you. Uh, we're fine on our own. Secondly, not enough room in the car. And thirdly, you're not invited. You absolutely need me. Uh, example one: You guys have the networking skills of Helen Keller on acid. Example two: Jim said you don't have enough gas money to make it halfway to the West Coast, which I, of course, will help with. And example three: You guys don't have any merch. I mean, everyone knows you make all your money on tour... with the merchandise you sell. So I had the sound guy burn me a live copy of your set. I've got about 30 blank CDs. We can burn them on my laptop and sell 'em at the shows. Hey, listen-- - Who is that? - Oh, that's Trout. He's been letting me crash here for a while. Jim has issues with people riding in his grandfather's car. Well, Jim already said it was okay. [ Jim ] I think it's a good idea. [ Alex ] No. You know, I'm sorry I have to be the bad guy here. Cassidy, you seem very nice. Nothing personal. It's just, um, you're a lovely girl-- [ Chuckles ] in the purely platonic sense-- but this is a two-man tour, so-- No. Okay? Done. [ Cassidy ] All right. Let's get to know each other. Is it out of line to say that sounded like an invite to a threesome? Okay, I'm gonna go first. Alex, what's up with that note... that Jim says you carry around in your pocket everywhere? Really, man? What? I didn't know it was, like, a personal note. I thought it was just for your, like, bucket list or something. Geez. Okay, Jim, how about you go first? Why do you live alone with your grandpa? Why did you get booted out of your band? Why did you get booted out of yours? Why'd you punch a retarded kid in the face? Why do you live in New Jersey? Why'd you punch a retarded kid? Guys, wow. Not what I meant. Okay, Cassidy, why are you willing to get in a car... and drive all the way across the country with two guys you don't even know, one of which you can't stand, and the other one obviously doesn't want you here? Are you running away from something, or are you just that bored? All right, all right. Look, I'll go first. [ Sighs ] Why do I live with my grandpa? Easy. Answer: Jimmy Johnson. - [ Alex ] Who's Jimmy Johnson? - A dog. My grandpa had a tiny, gnarly, all-white dog who used to bite dicks named Jimmy Johnson. Wait a second. You had a dog that used to bite dicks? Yeah. Ruined so many parties when I was a kid. It was always the same. Jimmy would come around, sniffing someone's crotch, which is not unusual. But with Jimmy, if you didn't instantly slap his face... hard enough to knock a kid off a bike, he would take two sniffs-- [ Sniffs ] [ Snarls ] He'd sink his teeth a good inch into your urethra. - No shit. - And Jimmy wasn't prejudiced. He had no specific taste. He liked white dick and black dick. And Asian dick. He fucking loved Asian dick. And old man dick. - But it was baby dick that finally did him in. - [ Cassidy, Alex ] No. Don't worry, there's not some two-year-old eunuch running around... thanks to Jimmy Johnson. But I'm telling you, that kid must've had, like, steel-plated diapers, 'cause my neighbor said he saw Jimmy swinging that kid around... for nearly 10 minutes straight. What does Jimmy Johnson have to do with living with your grandpa? Getting there. After that, my family had an intervention forcing Gramps to put Jimmy down. Only Grandpa threw a fit. We had to have a cop there and everything. My dad actually framed Jimmy Johnson's death certificate and hung it on our wall. And after my grandpa's stroke, he just pretty much stayed in the house all the time. One day, my dad came by, cooking him up some food. Goes down into basement to grab something. Who should launch himself at my father's crotch, like a bolt of white lightning out of the darkness? Good ol' Jimmy Johnson, who's so feverishly starved for the taste of dick by this time, that he knocked my father backwards at a shelf of my grandmother's preserves, which came crashing down-- Fucking blam! Killed Jimmy right on the spot. Dead, mid-feast. But not without my dad having to get 15 stitches in his cock. Jesus. I know. My grandpa's a pretty complicated guy. Or maybe not. Maybe he's just, like, really simple. You know? He didn't want his dog to die. It's not like he defended Jimmy ever. He just said, "If everyone who should've been euthanized was euthanized, there'd be nothing left but the trees." I guess he thought even the meanest, craziest bastards deserve some looking after. So I guess that's kind of what I'm doing with my grandfather. My gramps is kind of my Jimmy Johnson. - [ Alex ] What the hell? - Yeah, this is a really big venue. How did you swing this, Jim? What do you mean? We're huge in Tennessee. So I'm assuming you saw the marquee. Hey, thanks for calling about the new name. We changed it right away. Had to print new flyers, but it's-- it's cool. It's totally cool. [ Man On P.A., Indistinct ] I imagine he's pretty decisive. Yeah, he can be pretty annoying. Check, one, two, two, two. Dressing room is right this way. [ Mouthing Words ] There's drinks, drinks. Snacks over here. Couple more snacks in there. A few delivery menus over there. If you guys need anything, just charge it to the club, okay? - Is he here? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, he'll be here later. Fuck yeah! Nice.

[ Laughs ] I scour the earth, looking for every baby toy instrument that I can find, and I master every one of them. Now this! - I don't know what you-- - He's on the horse. He's back on the horse like a nymphomaniac at a donkey show. What? He's using again? Yeah. Yeah, he called me 10 minutes ago... from a farm... up in-- up in Vermont. And he says he's not going to make the show, and he hopes that you can find it in your heart to forgive him. And his final words were, "Peace... comes from... the detonation of whispers."

I'm sorry about before. I'm just-- You know what? You were right. I was bored with my life. Yeah. I've always wanted to do something interesting. And I was living with a guy for a while, and then I woke up and realized I hated him. What happened? He punched me in the face. [ Groans ] Oh, no. No, it wasn't like that. Jesus. It wasn't like that. No, he had taken a bunch of acid... and thought I was a velociraptor running straight towards him. That happens. Yeah. But it did make me realize that I was suddenly becoming... everyone I grew up hating. And it just hit me. No pun intended. Really? You couldn't help yourself, could you? I'm sorry. No, I-I, um-- No, I left home for kind of s-similar reasons. I mean, not physical violence... to my face. [ Chuckles ] But, um, I don't know. My parents had my brother... at the normal age that people have kids, and they had this normal life. And then, like, 17 years later, there I come out of nowhere. Total mistake. But my parents are both born-again Christians so, you know-- So I ended up having these really old parents... who were already kind of planning their lives, you know, after kids, and they just, well, never really stopped. So I'm 14. They leave me with my brother. And my brother's amazing, but I'm this really weird kid... that's-- that's being raised in this super normal... conservative suburb in northern San Diego. So he had his work cut out for him, you know. I hear San Diego's beautiful. Yeah. Not so much where I lived. [ Laughs ] No, it's this-- it's this weird fucking isolated world... where-- where nothing ever changes. I mean, not the haircuts, not the weather, nothing. But I always felt like I was changing.

Practically taught himself to read when he was three years old. Writes these short stories too-- about this kid who skips second grade named Cannon... who turns into a monster. - Sounds pretty cool. - Yeah. Except that three years ago his teacher recommended he skip second grade, and now he doesn't have any friends, he sits alone at lunchtime... and he writes stories with a main character named after a gun.

No, his songs sucked. He probably just didn't understand monsters very well then. I don't know. His songs sucked. I just-- I hated that dude. What didn't he understand about monsters? Well, monsters are usually more afraid of us... than we are of them. They think people hate them because they're different. Did you know Frankenstein was a genius? All the movies always make it look like he's really stupid, but in the original book he's a genius, but everybody's afraid of him so he always has to be alone.

You picked your classes already? Uh, yeah. But I, um-- I might want to take, uh, music as my elective... instead of pre-algebra. But your counselor said if you take pre-algebra this year, you can do calculus in high school. You can still test into a higher math when you get to high school. It's important to stick to plans.

Kids are directionless at this age. They need guidance. It's just a class. No, it's not. It is not. He is learning to make decisions between whims and goals. Okay? Something you never learned to do.

Didn't even really have to change many of the lyrics. It was weird. Are-- Are you heartbroken? You know, that is not something you're supposed to ask someone, Jackson. Oh. But are you? I guess I tried to make her that thing, you know? But we both knew it was wrong, and-- and she's just a little more brave than me. But still, part of you is like, "What the fuck?" You know? Thanks for talking to me. It's nice. I like talking to you. Hey. What? It's not gonna always be like this, you know? What isn't? Pre-algebra. Sitting alone at lunchtime. I got spies. Here's a fact. The nerdiest kids in school-- 10, 15 years out of high school, they've got the hottest chicks, the biggest houses, the best lives. But, you're gonna have to go through a little bit of hell first. It's called paying your dues. Were you a nerd? Uh, you know what? I was more of a dork. We're kind of the wild cards, you know? We end up being, like, priests, or artists, or, like, 10th-level grand wizards to the elves in some make-believe video game world... that we insist exists in another dimension. It's a spectrum.

I don't blame you for being mad. Oh, I'm not mad. No, I'm-- I'm learned. I'm taught. You taught me a very valuable lesson about trust and lying and soullessness. So thank you. I went back, Alex.

Jim's really messed up about it. He's headed home alone? He's going to L.A. What? Why? He said he was doing it for his grandpa. He said it would haunt him forever... if he turned his back on what he loved. He meant "haunt" too. He said if anyone could come back, it would be him. He kept saying something about a Green Beret? Anyway, it gets worse. Jim's show is in the Mercenary Riot. What's the Mercenary Riot? Bands like Marilyn Manson and Slipknot play in the Mercenary Riot. [ Sighs ] Brian, need your car. What are you talking about? - Jimmy Johnson. - Who? He's a dog. He used to bite dicks. Besides the point. What are you talking abou-- Wh-Who is this? Brian, for the last year and a half, I have been dressing up... in a skintight pink moose fleece... and playing music in front of preschools and nursing homes and halfway houses... and classrooms full of violent, knife-wielding, mentally handicapped people. And I've also, for the last three years, been working... at a very low-rung real estate office, in which I've experienced some of the most gross, soul-crushing mediocrity... that I think a person can experience. But I do it, because for one day a week, for about 20 minutes, I get to get up on stage in front of six, seven people at the most, and play my stupid little songs. And to tell you the complete, honest truth, as pathetic as it might seem, it fills me. And so I do. And I have only met one other person in my entire life like that. And, Brian, if you can get me to L.A. in less than three hours, I will give you my half of the house. I'll sign any paperwork you need me to sign. I don't want your half of the house. I want you to have it. It's not my home. It's yours. We had selfish parents, man. But you never were. You always gave a shit. [ Laughs ] And I always knew that you did. So it's yours.
