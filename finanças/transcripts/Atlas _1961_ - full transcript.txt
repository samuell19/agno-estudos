(soaring music with fanfares) - Do you think he'll respect the dove of peace? - I don't know. - Garnis! - Did I hear a gentle voice? - No, you heard mine. - What do you suppose they want? - Well, old Telektos knows that we can't take Thenos by frontal assault and we know that he's only got two months of food left. - The spring inside the wall could be running dry. - Very possible. Well, Thenos is a magnificent prize, well worth waiting for. - Nonsense. With your capacity for treachery, we'll be inside the walls in less than a week. (stately grand orchestral music) - Well, Telektos, you old rooster. You've done a pretty good job holding me off. I wish I could have met you under pleasanter circumstances. - The circumstances are of your own invention. Is it not customary in your land to introduce the archon? - Well, I'm not an archon, but if you insist. Garnis? - Attention citizens of Thenos! You are honored to receive Proximates, tyrant of Cyronikas. - Telektos, archon of Thenos. - Well, enough of this nonsense. Now tell me, what did you want to talk to me about? - Your forces have been besieging Thenos for three months, 12 days and 19 hours. - That sounds reasonably accurate. - However, in spite of the surprise of your attack and your superiority in number, you have been unable and will continue to be unable to make an impression in our defenses. - Garnis! - Oh, will you drink? - No thank you, I am not thirsty. - [ Garnis] The tyrant will be insulted if you refuse to drink with him. - So, we're unable to breach your walls, go ahead. - On the other hand, we have food and water enough to hold out for at least two years. - I'm glad to hear that. - My son Indros, aware that your soldiers must be suffering as much as our own people, suggests that we might resolve the war by personal combat. The combat will be to the death. - Excellent, I'll be glad to fight you any time. You choose the time, the place and the weapons. - My son is the challenger. He will meet any champion you care to bring forth. Should Indros be the victor, you will agree to take your army, and leave my land forever. Should your man be the winner, I promise to open the gates of Thenos for your troops, guarantee your security, and to govern as vassal beneath your appointed suzerain. (menacing orchestral music) - Why not? Only give us 10 days to select a champion. - So be it. - Farewell Telektos, you're a courageous old roach. We'll see you in 10 days. Come, Garnis. - We know the gods will be with us. - In the arena you will be alone my son, and Praximedes will find the best, the very best. - [Garnis] So you went for it. - I have no reason to refuse. This way, we get a holiday from the siege, a trip to Olympia for the games, and afterwards a free show. - And if our man loses, we simply resume the siege. (laughs) I wonder what the going prices are on Olympic champions. (soaring orchestral music) - Here? Where is she? - She probably stopped for something to eat again. - Well, go find her. I'll be sitting up here. - Candia! If we miss the wrestling, Proximates will have you plucked, cleaned, roasted and fed to the poor. No thanks, I'm too used to eating crow. - You'll never see anything like this in Cyronikos. - I've never really seen Cyronikos. Come on, let's hurry or we'll both be on the table. - All right, but pay for my cake. I'll be with the master. - Don't choke on it. - [Candia] On which? Hello, darling. - Oh, hello. I was dreaming that you were looking for me. - You were? The power of love. - What's love? - It's too much for me, ask your state philosopher. - Look, the wrestling's about to start. - And now the wrestling finals! This match will decide the Olympic champion of all Hellas! The semifinal winners are the present Olympic champion from Athens, Galibus! (cheering) - Oh, look at that one. He looks like he could tear me limb from limb. - So could a maddened chimpanzee. - And Atlas, champion of Epidorus! (cheering) - Atlas, indeed. - I wonder who's holding up the Earth. - Begin. (cheering) - Three talents he beats Galibus and goes with us to Thenos. - You don't have three talents, - Well, I'm using your money. (cheering) - Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! - He did it, he did it! You owe me three talents. - You didn't bet. - What's the name they're yelling? - Atlas! Atlas! - Garnis, I want you to go to the athletes entrance and wait for him. Find him and follow him and come back and tell me where he is. I want to arrange an accidental meeting. It's a pity that you'll have to miss the rest of the events. - My pleasure. - For many as are the ills that are incident to the state, you have not the gods to blame, but you yourselves. Whenever you deliberate on the business of the state, you distrust and dislike men of superior intelligence and cultivate instead the most depraved of the orators who come before you. For those of you who are concerned about this growing decadence in our democracy, there will be a dialogue at my home tomorrow. - The Inthans have attacked the Spartans and Zeus is milking goats in Persia. - Oh, that I've heard. There's also rumors of a marriage between Socrates and Sappho. - Oh did you hear the titans have returned to Earth and are studying philosophy? - Name one. - Atlas. - Impossible. - No, I saw him myself not an hour ago. - Oh, really? How did you look? Fit and handsome? - No, old and tired. He's still feeling the effects of the match with Hercules. - Ah, but this time he won. I'm Proximates, tyrant of Cyronikas. - Tyrant? Ah, of course you know who I am, or you wouldn't have made up all that nonsense. - How perceptive. Well, will you walk with us? - Why not? I have a few minutes. - Besides, I've never spoken with a tyrant before. - [Candia] It's very much like speaking with a human being. - Apparently, we have a quorum. - These two impertinent citizens are Garnis, state philosopher, and Candia, priestess of Hygaea. - [Atlas] A state philosopher, a high priestess and a Socrates all in one day. I have met the greats. - Tell me, what did you think of my Socrates oration? - I haven't had time to think of it. And even when I have, I like to change my opinion as the years go by. Ask me on my deathbed. - Do you think you'll die in bed? - I can't be sure of anything. - Well, you know who you are. - I know that when I was three days old, I pulled my father's beard. In a fit of mischief, he named me Atlas. - So, you know you have a mischievous father. - And a wise one, I hope. What did you want to talk to me about? - Oh, I just wanted to learn some more about you. For instance, what do you think of war? - War? Well, as I see it, or rather, as my father explained it to me, there are two principal forces at work in the world, both affect the general direction of civilization. One is creation, the other destruction. War is a supreme example of destruction. - But you are opposed to war? - Yes. - So am I. - [Candia] I'm glad you both share the same opinion. - So what do you want from me? - Well, for the past few months, I've been involved in a small but bloody war. You could be instrumental in calling a halt to that war, thereby saving hundreds of lives. Does that idea appeal to you? - No, not yet. What could I do that would stop a war? - Be my Achilles, fight the enemy champion. - To the death? - Yes. - No. - You won't kill? - I've avoided it so far. - Think of the hundreds you'll save. - Now this is going much too fast. Tell me about the war, justify it. - Well, the enemy is a small city-state called Thenos, far up in the hills. A few years ago the Thenians attacked Cyronikos, butchered the entire population, and carried away all the treasure from the temples. So you see, we're only regaining that which is rightfully ours. - And that justifies warfare? - Would you accept payment? - If I decide to fight your battle, we can talk about it. But don't try to entice me with it. - Well, there's no need to discuss it now. We're all going, even Candia, to the Olympic banquet tonight. Perhaps when we see you there, you will have reached a decision. But remember, there's no firm line between creation and destruction. One cannot survive without the other. - I'll consider that, we'll speak again tonight. - Well, children, what do you think? - That he has a beautiful body, and an even more beautiful mind. Filled with facts and notions that have never been organized. - And guess who's going to organize them. (sultry music) - Atlas, when you fight a really strong man, with sinews like iron and flesh like marble, and you defeat him, how, how does it make you feel? - Tired. - A woman! - Are you nervous? - Do you think I enjoy being a public curiosity? - Relax and enjoy it, who knows? We may be starting a new fad. - Do you know that brazen harlot? - She's my sister. - Think how Cyronikos will shine with an Olympic champion in the court. Oh, here he comes now. Now Candia, I want you to cultivate him a little. - Suppose I cultivate him too much? - Then I'll have you boiled in oil. - Do you usually try to do the outrageous? - I don't try, I succeed. Sit down. - Is that how you customarily treat your state philosopher? - Well that's the only thing a philosopher understands. Isn't it, Garnis? - Yes, a philosopher should never be allowed to feel too sure of himself. He's liable to stop talking and begin actively meddling. - And what is your philosophy? - Well, I believe that it's the duty of all thoughtful, reasonable men to make themselves as comfortable as possible. - That would take away all the fun. - Well, that depends on your definition of fun and comfort. Now to some men, war is comfortable, because it's the only thing they can do well. Oh by the way Atlas, have you made a choice between destruction and creation? - Well, that's not a decision to be reached in a few hours. Or years. - Most people make that choice before they even know they've done so. (laughs) Excuse me, an old friend just dropped by. Oh Candia, entertain Atlas as best you can until I get back. - Of course I can't entertain you as best I can. Not with all these people around. - Did that provocative remark come naturally to you? Or were you ordered to work on me? - Neither. We're so used to trying to shock one another, that we usually sow the unexpected. - Sometimes I'm guilty of the same thing. - Have you considered Proximates request? - I find it hard to believe him. I don't know him. I think it'd be hard to know him. - Not really. It's embarrassing being a tyrant in an age of democracy. When you see how much Cyronikos depends on him, when you see the granaries and the aqueducts he'll build with that treasure, you might feel that a touch of tyranny can sometimes be forgiven. - You make him sound terribly benevolent. - Do I? What about you? Are you benevolent? You seem to have just popped up out of the ground and landed in the Olympics. - You might say I did just that. - I'm glad, and I'm not trying to shock you. - What can I say to that? - That you'll come with us to Thenos. - You're no longer thinking of the battle of the titans. - Well, we can have that too, but it's a long trip. We follow the cliffs high above the bluest water you can imagine. We go through cool pine forest where the night smells like something good to drink. Come with us, and I'll show you the countryside. - That sounds more dangerous than Proximates fight to the death. (laughs) - I'm not dangerous, I'm just a tiny woman. - Who belongs to a big and benevolent tyrant with a powerful and obedient army. - So that's how you see it? I did belong to him. At any rate, Proximates army stands before Thenos. Will you come with us? - All right, I'll go on your trip with you. There'll be plenty of time to think about the fight on the way. (plodding orchestral music) What place is this? - Welcome to Cyronikos. - Your land? - One corner of it, we have to pass through this section to get to Thenos. - Are ruins a normal feature of the country? - Hellas is filled with ruins. Some date back hundreds of years, to the very beginning of time. - But these, of course, are new ruins. - Destruction and creation again. Monarchs and temples rise up, only to fall into dust. Cyronikos has had more than it's share of ruins, and I intend to put a stop to it. - And I suppose war is one way of doing it. - One way. - [Soldier] Proximates, - Halt! - Proximates! - Form column, twos! Form line, front! Archers, volley! (grim orchestral music) Resume phalanx! Attack! (intense orchestral music) Aren't you impressed Atlas? - I admit I'm impressed, but you seem to enjoy the massacre. - No, although I'll admit I'm somewhat satisfied that there's one less band of Thenian bandits to attack my people. - How do you plan to get them out of the cave? - There's a procedure for every situation. Watch and see. (screams from cave) - Looks like you won't take many prisoners. - Three dead, four wounded. No escapees, no prisoners. - Good, reform the escort, give the men five minutes, resume the march. We'll camp as soon as we get into Thenian territory. - He seems a bit squeamish. - Form up! We're moving out! You've got a wounded leg. Keep using it, and you won't have a limp. So, you got a little nick in the side, huh? Drink some hot broth, get a good night's sleep. You'll be just fine again in the morning. Take him to the infirmary. Double rations for everyone. Lately I feel moments of old age. - You seem to care a great deal about your men. - I love them. I can't stand to see them hurt. But why do I have to kill to prevent it? Why do they come at me from all sides, screaming for blood? Today I killed men, why? So their widows could weep? No, so that the wives of my own men could sleep quietly tonight. Come walk with me. Look at those columns. What strength it must take to stand against the wind and the rain and the thunder of Zeus. Atlas, be glad that you're not a tyrant. You have nothing to do, but wander the earth and search for the truth. You think you'll find it? - I don't know, maybe the truth is in the searching. - Well taken. - Are you searching for truth too, Candia? - Not anymore. - There's no point in wandering the earth. I have hundreds of people in my court who think they've found the truth. - I've listened to them for years. They fall all over themselves, trying to agree with one another. - Oh please, Candia. You'll discourage Atlas from visiting us at Cyronikos. - Atlas is free to do as he wants. - Of course! Atlas, we actually know very little about you, - For all your talking, I know as little about you. - Well, we know that your father was a citizen of Epidorus. - That's not true. He was a laborer with one wife, 12 children and no vote. He couldn't read, but he could think. When I was old enough, he threw me out. Told me not to come back until I could answer his questions. - And you still can't. - No. - Where did you go? - To Athens. I worked in the marble quarries and listened to the impractical speeches of the philosophers. I won a pointless victory in the Olympic games, and I'm still the most ignorant man on the face of the earth. I talk too much. I'm going to get something to eat. - Hearty appetite. - By the way, I've decided to fight your man. I won't kill him, but I'll fight him, - Good. What an amazing young man. - What? (laughs) - You're really quite taken with him, aren't you? - What do you mean, taken with him? - You know very well what I mean. Well, it's nice to see stars in your eyes again, though I wish they were for me. - So you could snuff them out again? - You know I worship the air you breathe. - Only if you breathed it before me. - Ah, what overpowering flattery. May I have a little kiss? - Since you own everything, including my soul, do what you want. - How was that? - Like the kiss of Apollo, if carved by Phidias. - Well since I've never kissed a statue before, I can't judge. Poor Candia, how you've aged. - But for such a worthy cause. - He's coming! - See anyone who looks like a champion? - Let's go down and give the devil a hearty welcome. - Proximates, I see you've arrived safe and sound. - Why shouldn't I? - The rebels are at it again. - What rebels? - He means the Thenian bandits, show us the army. - I would say you have enough troops to take any city. - One man on that wall is worth 20 on the outside. But don't worry, we'll be in Thenos in the morning. - [Soldier] A Thenian rider coming. - Tell him Atlas will meet Indros at sunrise and both sides can bring a few guests. - Does everyone have a good seat? (laughs) Today we are to see the contest that will decide if the future course of Thenos is to continue as an isolated, underdeveloped, little democracy or is to join with Cyronikos in a military and economic alliance to the eternal benefit of both. The champions are Indros of Thenos and Atlas of Cyronikos. The weapons have been chosen. They will fight without pause or time limit. To the death, those are the conditions. And on the sound of the trumpets, the battle shall be joined. - He's good. - Indros is better. - Arione, you shouldn't be here. - If Indros has to die, I want to be with him. - What if Atlas loses? We're in a good position. We could kill Telektos and his entire senate. - That'll never get us inside. We're perfect targets from the walls. But if they kill me, nobody will go on with the war. - True. (jeering) (cheering) - Finish him! Kill him. Kill him, Kill him! Why didn't you finish him? You could have snapped his neck like a twig. - The battle is done. That which Thenos has asked has been granted. And now we must honor our pledge. The city is yours. Let them enter. - Cyranikons! - Hail, Proximates! - Thenians! - Hail, Proximates. - The city is yours. - Hail, Proximates. - My, your church looks grotty. - They have had no water. - Telektos, you're looking very down in the mouth. Now look at it this way, the siege is over, your people have been saved. In fact, your own son wasn't killed. You've got plenty to be thankful for. Look, why don't we have a banquet to celebrate? We'll invite the public officials and the women. - Women? Do you want our women? (laughs) - Oh you old goat, you're way behind the times. In Cyronikos, the women have been emancipated for years. - This is not- - What were you about to say? You of course will provide the magicians and the dancers, will you not? - We have no dancers, except the sacred dancers of the temple. - Well, that's fine. You know, this banquet is going to be just wonderful. People will be talking about it for years. - Oh, by Zeus what a dull party. - We're not here celebrating a victory. We're here celebrating the predestined union of two great states. Thenos is now free to develop right along with Cyronikos. There's plenty of wine, so drink up, and bring on the dancing girls! - That's what I've been waiting to hear. Maybe this will warm you up. (laughing) What kind of a virgin dance is that? - [Partygoer] They're dressed up like my grandmother! (screams and grim orchestral music) - You know, with good luck and the women willing, this may end up as a good old fashioned orgy. And now as our two peoples approach divine unity, let us hear Homeric tributes. I drink to greater Cyronikos, and from the lips of our hosts and comrades, let us hear prophecies. Telektos, what do you see in the future for Thenos? - I'm too overwhelmed by the present. - Overwhelmed with joy. Garnis, what do you say? - I see a golden dawn of peace, backed by the brazen shield of strength. Two states, two cultures, now one, now invincible. - Candia! Let us hear your prediction. - I want to make a toast to those who have been forgotten at this charming revel. To the gods, and especially to those who watch over and guide the destinies of Proximates and his accomplices. To Ares, god of war, Hermes god of thieves and Pallor, god of terror. As for the future, I suggest that each of you hide a coin beneath your tongues. For you'll soon need it to pay passage to Charon to cross the river Styx. - Get out of here. - And for Atlas and Indros, I offer Lethe, god of oblivion. So that they may forget. - Leaving so soon? - I think I'll sacrifice these simple pleasures for a little air. Goodnight. - I want her. - Then take her. - What about Indros? - Take him, too. - [Soldier] Rolling now. Loser, Herkon's roll. - The gods are sleeping. - [Soldier] Eight to five, take 'em. Haha, the gods have awakened, two to one. - [Herkon] Taken. - How do you think I'll look in blue? - Just as dumb as you look in red. - Quiet! Here comes Atlas. - Suppose somebody thinks we really are Thenians? - That's the idea, stupid. We start a fake revolt so Proximates has an excuse to wipe out the whole Thenian army. - All right, get these blue uniforms on! We're ready to go. - Were you really drunk? - If I hadn't been, he would have killed me on the spot. - You want to get out very bad. - To escape my paramour, I'd have to flee by night, on foot, in rags. Maybe with luck I could get to Delphi and hobble around the street selling sponges. - Or you could climb Olympus. The gods are always looking for someone new. - But I'm nothing new. Besides, who would want me? I certainly wouldn't. - I don't mean to pry. - Oh yes you do. You've made a career of prying, but you do it very well. - I suppose I have to try to know everything. - Well, then I'll tell you a Trojan epic of stunning duplicity. The saga of Candia and Proximates. The Helen and Paris of Cyronikos. Once upon a time I was a virgin in the service of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth. After Proximates killed his father and became tyrant, he did away with my priestess so I could have the job. More or less. I believed in all the gods in those days. And I believed in Proximates and his false promise. - That is when you should have run. - How could I run? I didn't know any better. I grew up surrounded by stories of gods and heroes, and I never learned to distinguish between them and reality. When I did, it was too late. - So you never ran. - Proximates never gives up his toys. You know, I've really forgotten about truth and decency until you- What are you going to do? - I'm invited to visit you at court in Cyronikos. - Don't do it. That's exactly what he wants. He wants to add you to his crown jewels. - I know, that's why I'm leaving tomorrow. THat's what I came to tell you. - That's good. That's the right thing. Where will you go? - I don't know, I think I'd like to visit Egypt. - Oh, I've been to Egypt. Does that surprise you? - A little. - Proximates took me there five years ago, when he was in love with me. Of course, he never was that much in love with me to marry me, thank Aphrodite. If you go to Egypt, there's a little shop there, just to the right of the dock. There's this little old man there who sells, I've forgotten what he sells. But I'd like to take you there and find out again. - I'd like to go there with you. (yelling) Thenians! Let's go! - Brothers, for Telektos! Kill the Cyranikons! - Let's get out! You're safe over there. (screams) (shouting and grandiose orchestral music) - So these are the times that inspire ballads. - Don't you want to help the Thenians? - It seems the Thenians brought this upon themselves. - There's too many, fight your way out! - There they are, my beautiful boys in blue. Was anyone hurt? - Phrygias was killed, nobody knows how. - Well, we'll give him a royal funeral. Well, I just want to look in on all of you. Oh, by the way, if anyone sees old Telektos, don't kill him, bring him to me alive. - Atlas, have you seen Proximates? - No. - Look what we've caught here. - How very brave of you. - So they got you, huh? - You fool, you tower of senility. Your treacherous acts tonight surpassed all. Because of your mad bloodlust for power, the streets of Thenos ran red with blood! - Thenian blood. - You may as well have killed them yourself. They run with Cyranikon blood as well, and I'll see that you pay for it. - I had no knowledge of tonight's uprising. I can only admire the courage of the young men who attempted it. - Did you hear that? I hope you show as much courage when you face the headsman's axe. Take him away. Don't worry old bird, you'll get a fair trial. - [Candia] Will you sit with me? Don't be frightened, I believe in Indros's father. I think he's innocent. - Good morning everybody. Quiet down, quiet down, this is a court of law. Now, I want you all to sit attentively and listen. Will the guards please bring in the accused? - What brings you here? - Have you missed me? - No. - Now since I'm somewhat prejudiced against the defendant, I will act as prosecutor and not as judge. As judge, I hereby appoint Gallus. Now, we have a judge and a prosecutor. To see that the archon gets full justice, we will appoint a defense counsel. The best man in all Thenos for the job, Garnis. Will you defend this man? - I will. - Will you do all in your power to see that the ends of justice are met? - I swear it. - Very well, take your place. - The trial is now on. - Telektos, archon of Thenos. You are accused of inciting Thenian troops to attempt a dastardly and foolhardy revolt against the peaceful occupying forces of Cyronikos. You are further accused of having, by your selfish and irresponsible act, caused the death of some 800 Thenian citizens. What do you have to say for yourself? - This mockery has obviously been staged for the entertainment of your officers. I shall not demean myself by addressing this so-called court. - [Crowd Member] What do you mean mockery? - [Audience Member] Kill him and get it over with! - If there's any further disturbance, I will clear this room of all Cyranikons and fill it with armed Thenians! I intend to prove that this trial is not a mockery, and that a Cyranikon judge and a Cyranikon defense counsel can treat with absolute sobriety, the fate of a Thenian archon. Since the archon has refused to testify, I will ask Garnis the questions, and his answers will fall fairly upon Thenian and Cyronikan ears! Garnis, is the archon guilty of the charges that I have set forth? - The archon is not guilty. - Can you prove that he is not? - I will endeavor to prove that you cannot prove that he is. - I accept the burden. Now, were there Thenian soldiers at the banquet here last night? - Are you asking as a witness, or as a counsel for the defense? - [Proximates} As a witness. - I saw troops dressed in Thenian uniforms attack the banquet. - Were there Thenian civilians attacking Cyranikons last night? - Yes. - Very well, Telektos is the leader of his people. His people revolted against the Cyranikons, who in self defense slew 800 Thenians. Therefore, Telektos is responsible for the death of 800 of his own people! - THat's an interesting example of applied logic. - Inescapable logic. - But suppose Telektos had no knowledge of the coming revolt. - What difference would that make? - Every difference when his life is at stake. I submit that Telektos does not own the people of Thenos. - And I submit that as archon of Thenos, he is responsible for the actions of his people, responsible for their welfare and their blunders! - Assume that I admit, and I do not, that the leader of a state is responsible for the irresponsible actions of his citizens. Can you base a sentence of death on such a technicality? - Technicality? You call the slaughter of 800 people a technicality? You call the breaking of a solemn promise a technicality? This man, this graven image of innocence, gave his solemn word that there would be no more fighting. Where is that assurance now? Where is his pledge of peace? - We must return- - Return to nothing! - The question is- - Yes or no? - I cannot answer. - A, the archon of Thenos assured us there would be no fighting between our people. B, there was fighting between our people. Was his assurance accurate? - I admit that it was not accurate. - At last. You admit that the archon did nothing to prevent the uprising. - I have no proof that he did not try to prevent the uprising. - I have 800 silent witnesses to the contrary. Well? - It's true that the archon is the leader of his people, but he's not an absolute monarch. The responsibility's diffused upon a great many shoulders. For he must always consult with the Thenian senate. - Then I'll try the whole blasted senate. - You would wipe out every leading citizen of Thenos? - I will see justice done. - I know you, Proximates. I know you as well as anyone could. And I am almost convinced that you are sincere. - Telektos, I meant every word that I said at the trial today. - I won't try to convince you that I knew nothing of this affair. You don't even consider that a valid point of my defense. But I do know that the members of my legislature are completely innocent. Many of them sat in that banquet room unarmed, and were murdered by your officers. - So, do you wish to make a statement? - Yes. In order to spare further innocent lives, I accept full and complete responsibility for whatever happened in Thenos last night. - Full and complete? - Yes. - I've no more to say. The matter is in the hands of Gallus and the gods. I ask the judge for leniency. - The archon has accepted the responsibility, and the charges are too great to afford me any discretion. I must declare the accused guilty, and sentence him to death by the axe. (grim orchestral music) - Are you going someplace? - Someplace. - Why? - My work for you is finished, isn't it? - I thought your work was to choose between destruction and creation, learning as much as you can about each. - I've learned destruction from you. I've learned that it comes in all shades and textures. - Proximates has offered you the hospitality of his court. To refuse it would be an insult. - Really? I thought it would be impossible to insult your master. - Don't fence with me, wrestler. I can have your entrails on the sand at the snap of a finger. - Start snapping. - Atlas, why don't you stay here and enjoy the fruits of your victory? - You've used me, Proximates, and I don't like it. I don't intend to be used again. - Well, suppose I should refuse to let you go? Sentry, go before the champion and have them open the gates. - So you're really going to let him go? - Why not? He's no good to me as a prisoner. When he really meets the world and finds out who he is, he'll be back. - I brought you some food. - Why don't you come with me? - I can help here more. Indros will need information about the city. - All right, now stay quiet, and don't mention your name, and never catch Proximates eye. - Come this way, around the other side. - Goodbye. - Stay below the walls. - Don't be afraid. - What are you going to do? - I could do any number of things. I could take you to Proximates who would kill you, or I could have pity and set you free. Then we could make some sort of arrangement. - There can be no arrangement. - Don't be too hasty, Arione, Indros is finished. Thenos is destined to be a province of slaves. I can bring you back to the comforts and pleasures of the court. One that someday will be the greatest in all Hellas. - I'm sorry, you may as well turn me in. - No, I can't do that. Candia's too good a friend to betray. And remember, we all need friends. I want to help you. - I'll remember. - So will I. - I killed and skinned a boar. - I'm not hungry yet. - We may be, one day. - A little gift from Proximates. - He knows you've left? - No, if he caught me, he'd use my head to repair some broken statue. - Candia, if you're going to go with me, you're going to have to give up a lot of little luxuries, including stealing. - I didn't steal these. Proximates owes you these for giving him Thenos. - I want to get so far away from Thenos that no one will have ever heard of it. - What do you mean Candia's not in the city? - Hew quarters haven't been occupied and we've searched every building. - She's probably gone after Atlas. Anarchy, insurrection, call out the palace guard and have them ready to leave immediately! - What do you think of Persian cooking? - I don't know, I never tried it. - Well, don't. When we get to Egypt and Persia, we're gonna try a lot of things. - Well, if it isn't Pan and his wood nymph! - What do you want? - I want you! - Leave us alone, Proximates! You don't need me at court anymore! - Don't tell me how to run my court! Besides, what makes you think you're going back to court? Tie them up! - Call off your men, Proximates! We're not going back! - Atlas, don't make me fight you. - Then call off your men! - Take him! (epic orchestral music) Atlas you're really amazing. You've killed three of my men for no good reason. That's against your principles, isn't it? Tie them up! Form up, form up there! Fill in that line up there! Stay on that line, hold it! Volley! Volley! They're gone. Face about! Form up! Attack! (crescendo orchestral music) - Remember me? - You look just like a dead Thenian bandit. - Not quite, I'm a live Cyranikon rebel, thanks for saving my life. - Thanks for saving ours. - Atlas, you look better to me as a rebel. - Let's go. - Where is everybody? - Just run in from Marathon? - Funny, funny, very funny! - Sorry. - Save your funny jokes for some other time. We've got lots of work to do. - Where's the palace guard? - You wanted me? - No, I wanted your great aunt Helen from Lesbos! Where are the spies I sent to find the rebels? - Here. - Here? Do they look like they're here, clubfoot? Go out and get 'em and bring in the generals! You'd think in this day and age, they'd have developed generals with brains! - When it gets cooler, we can be moving on. - Moving on? What do you mean? - We're going to Egypt. - When? - In a few hours. - I'm thinking about it. - I thought you came here to join us. - I came here because you saved us from Proximates. - And we're grateful. - You're not going to fight? - I didn't say I wasn't going to fight. I'm thinking about it. - Well, what do you have to think about? You pick up a sword and you fight. What's the matter, you afraid to fight? - Atlas is more than a fighter. He's trying to solve the riddle of destruction and creation. - Indros, they're both crazy. - Maybe Proximates was right when he said that one can't exist without the other. Maybe the creation is life and destruction is death. Something has to die so that something can be reborn. One thing is certain. I have to stop wondering, and start doing. - He's gonna fight. - We were on our way to Egypt. - The opening is extremely narrow. 50 men could hold off our entire force. - Are you giving me a lesson in tactics? - No, sir. - Will somebody get some water in here? - Now I want you leaders of men to go into the next room and come up with four different plans for attacking the enemy. Well don't just stand there like marble statues. We'll move you out into the yard and build a temple around you. Get out! - I've never seen you so cheerful. - I know I'll have to make the plan myself. Maybe we won't have to attack at all. Indros was planning on marrying that girl he was with at the banquet. Put her under guard, then send a message to Indros that unless he surrenders immediately, we'll sacrifice her to Dionysus. - It's not a bad idea, but- - But what? - Well, if you send a messenger to Indros, you give away the fact that you know where he is. - Did I ask you for a critique of my intentions? Maybe you're right. We'll send a Thenian prisoner. - I don't think one would go for it. - Behold, the oracle of Delphi speaks. - Well, put yourself in Indros' place. Would you condemn yourself and your city for a woman? - I didn't say the plan was foolproof, I just said it was worth a try. Now go get the girl. - But don't you think- - I said go get the girl! - Arione. - Yes? - You must leave Thenos now, your life is in danger. - What life in Thenos is not? - Listen to me. Proximates intends to hold you hostage against Indros surrender. - Indros won't surrender. - I know that. So what will happen? Proximates will kill you, that's the sort of promise he keeps. - Why should I believe you? - Would I have any other reason for sending you away? - Your master might. - Arione, I'm telling you the truth. At this very moment, I'm supposed to be turning you over to the guards. If Indros doesn't surrender, and as you say, he won't, Proximates intends to sacrifice you to Dionysus. - What will happen to you after I'm gone? - Don't worry about that. I can talk myself out of anything. But you must leave here, don't go to Indros. Proximates is going on the offensive soon. The whole army will be destroyed. Go to Athens and come every day to the Erechtheion at noon. I'll meet you there, now hurry. (whistling) - Where's the girl? - Gone. - Explain. - I've just come from torturing her handmaiden. Indros was here last night. - Indeed? - And when he left, he took her with him. - Garnis, I can't understand it. - What can't you understand? - You, you were the closest to me of all. You and Candia, the others were just fawning dogs, begging for bones. - You think I've deceived you? - Don't. - What shall I say? - Tell me the truth. - I've been with you too long. I've forgotten the truth. (laughs) - Ah, that's better Garnis. Garnis, I'm gonna kill you now. When you're gone, I'll be all alone. Are you afraid of death? - Yes. - I'm not afraid of being alone. I've always been alone. - You're gonna kill me, what do you expect? Compassion? - Not at this late date. Garnis, you were always a good talker. Have you got any last burst of brilliance for me? - Even now, you're trying to get something out of me. But it's too late, for when you brought us here, you gave us a chance to see and remember. Then we left you. And the only one who will come back is Atlas. - I predicted he'd come back, remember? - Not to join you, but to kill you. (laughs) - Garnis! - Why did you come here? - Proximates was about to use me for bait. Garnis told me in time. - Garnis? - He said Proximates would go on the offensive soon. - That means he knows where we are. We'll have to move the camp. Proximates knows by now that Arione has come here. He won't waste any time. You think you could hold him off? - Well, if he attacks the entrance, it'll be another Thermopylae, but I don't think he'll be that stupid. - Well, if he comes after you, he'll bring everything he's got. That'll leave the city undefended. - He'll leave some men on the wall. - But not many. He said that one man on the wall was worth 20 on the outside. How did you and your men escape on the night of the massacre? - There's a sally port. - Good, send your men in that way, and attack the wall from behind. You have scouts near Thenos? - Yes, they'll tell us as soon as he leaves. He's probably on the move already. - Leave enough men here to make him think he's attacking you. We'll move everybody else to Thenos. - We? - Well, Candia and I will eventually go to Egypt. But Proximates is a thing that has to be destroyed now. - Thenians assemble! - Cyranikons assemble! (majestic orchestral music) - [Soldier] Move along, quickly! - Attack, attack! - [Soldier] Hold the head of the line! (yelling) - Halt! Will you surrender, or go on fighting and be wiped out? - We'll surrender. - Put your men on the walls, watch for Proximates return! - [Soldier] Watchers on the walls! - Clear the area! I want every man hidden. We'll lay a trap for Proximates. - Are the rats in the trap? - You better take a look. - Follow, follow! We're returning to Thenos at full run! - The men will be too exhausted to fight. - Full run! - Forward everyone! (eerie and ominous music) (yells) - [Soldier] Form up the phalanx! Shields up! Hold the line, hold your ground! - Fall back and form a wedge, fall back! Form Wedge, form wedge! Attack! Break the phalanx! (yelling) - Atlas. - Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! Atlas! - Even when we get to Egypt, it won't be far enough. - What do you mean? - They know you now, and they'll come looking for you. Everyone has a Proximates to destroy. - Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be. (sweeping music)
