(soft music) - Whoa there. Whoa. - Here hold these. Pleasure ma'am. (knocking at door) - [Moses] Welcome home Miss Rhonda. - [Rhonda] Hello Moses. Thanks Spencer. - [Moses] The master is expecting you. - [Richard] It's wonderful to see you again Rhonda. - [Rhonda] Me to, I wouldn't have made the trip from England if I hadn't have missed you all. - My, but you've grown beautiful. - Naturally, but now I'm a big girl. - Now my boy Clarence, how's he? - Clarence is extremely well. (soft music) Do your slaves work well? - You bet, I have a system for getting the best out of them. - Is that so. - You'll see it in action for yourself. Hurry it up. This section's gotta be finished by this evening. That clear? Iron fist ma'am. - I can see that. (laughing) - Orders clearly given and no empty threats. Any disobedience and they know what's in store for them. This way my plantation never had a bad year. - [Guard] Come on, unload those mules. Be quick about it. - See that Rhonda? Why my cotton is the best-- - Is the best and the most priced in the state of Louisiana. You don't need to tell me. Well I don't know how I would be able to help you now. - Well a woman can be very useful on a place like this, you know? Why there are a number of things that a woman can do better than a man, given that they have a man's character. And I see you do have one. Am I right? - Well yes. - Very good. Careful not to wet those bales, they'll be ruined. You know my wife, she never once took any interest in my work. Now when she saw me leave, she'd always say I was gonna commit a mortal sin with some slave girl. - Probably she often had reason to say so, and although I'm not in agreement with mortal sin on any case, slaves are no better than animals. (rhythmic drumming) - [Spencer] Get a move on you lot bear. Come on start digging. Faster! What're you doing, taking a nap. Come on. Work, work. Those two over there, who are they? - [Worker] A new couple. - Where did they come from? - [Worker] She's from the Mandingo tribe. - Just a minute. - What do you want? - [Spencer] Ah you're proud like all your tribes. - Let me go, where are you taking me? (struggling) - Just showing you that you're just a slave. That I'm master of your body and life. - No, no! (screaming) (struggling and crying out in protest) - Leave her alone, she's mine. - The whip. - [Worker] Here comes the boss. - [Spencer] Morning boss. - [Richard] What's been going on here, Herb? What has this swine done? - He tried to kill me. - [Richard] What because of her? (whip cracking) Come here you. Take him away. - Come on. You'll learn your lesson soon enough. (soft music) - [Spencer] She's a Mandingo. - You think you're civilized do you? What's this. I suppose you were the daughter of a chief. Take her away to the stable block and teach her a lesson. - You're going to realize that the only salvation for a slave is begging for pity. (laughing) (whip cracking) (painful grunting) Go on, take my pardon. (laughing) (grunting) (water splashing) - [Spencer] This is that new slave that just arrived. - [Richard] Ah good, tell me, don't you know that trees must be planted straight? I'm sure you'll learn, you seem to be born for straightening. Well let's see how you make out with me. (laughing) But of course you can. We must find out what you can do. Spencer, get back to work. Good morning Miss Rhonda. You were right not to show yourself back there. It's better to not disturb him during certain periods. - Does he often have these periods? - I would say yes. When his eye falls on a pretty one. After all, slaves are here for that to. It's part of their duties. - Is that part of the action? - Certainly, it's always been that way for slaves. Whether it be men or women. But of course a white woman should never lower herself to a Negro. Especially when they are whites, who are only too ready and willing. I know a wonderful place, we can go there by boat. - Thanks for the proposal. But the boat might lose it's balance. Be careful you don't lose yours. It could be extremely dangerous. (romantic music) (moaning and heavy breathing) - [Spencer] Now get to work. And next time I'll kill ya. No one is to help him. No one, you understand. Mister Hunter has already decided to sell him. (birds chirping) - [Spencer] Oh it's you Miss Rhonda. - I've already told you Spencer I'm not game. - Be careful Miss Rhonda, this part is full of traps you know. - Yes I know. It was I who had them installed. I'm fond of hunting. In all it's forms. In fact that's why I'm here. To see if anyone's been caught. - No, no one is yet. - Tell me Spencer. Were you already here at the time Mister Hunter married my cousin Elizabeth? - Certainly. As a matter of fact, it was I who introduced them to each other. - And would you help me to know Mister Hunter better? - Yes indeed, in any way I can. - Why did the marriage between my cousin and Mister Hunter go wrong, it certainly wasn't in health that forced her to leave him. She would never tell me. - Well Mister Hunter is a man who-- - Allowed himself a free reign. Is that all? - Poor Misses Hunter is very delicate. - Which he certainly isn't. But that's not enough. I want to know the truth. What else was it? - Well you see Mister Hunter likes to use the whip. - On the slaves? - Not only on the slaves. (whip cracking) (crying out) - I don't wanna mess you up too much. I sorta go for you. - Well has the chief's daughter learned her lesson? You come from the Ivory Coast don't ya? The chief's daughter of the Mandingo tribe. Leave us alone. Now you're just for me. You should also be a virgin, seeing as how you were so keen on Row. (grunting) (rhythmic drums) (moaning and heavy breathing) - What's this, not ready yet? - [Slave] Just a few minutes more Master. - Ever since it's been known that I go by rounds on the track to keep an eye on the slaves, the track mysteriously falls to pieces. Stand still. - Why the bastards. (whipping) (yelling) You get that work done or else. Now hitch up the horse. - [Slave] Yes Master. - One misses a woman around the place. A woman like you my dear. It was built by my father. He said he needed it for hunting. But in fact he brought his slave girls here. He didn't care to wash his dirty linen in public. He and his absurd wretchitude. As though he wasn't the master anyhow. (soft music) - Who knows how many girls have trembled here and cried, and liked it. What stories these trees could tell, as the leaves sigh in the breeze. And so exciting. Because it tells a slave girl and master. I feel it. And you feel it to. Yes even you. You know I want to be your white slave. Something Elizabeth never was. I'm on fire. You never had a white slave girl before have you? Your lips. And now. Take this. Whip me. I'm your slave. I want you to punish me, for these desires. (whip cracking) (crying out) (soft music) (heavy breathing) (screaming) (baby crying) - [ Spencer] Mister Hunter? - [Richard] What is it? - That nigress Mandi, died in child birth. - [Richard] How about the child? - That I don't know. It seems to have disappeared. They probably thought you would have killed it. - Why should I kill my own child? I'm not a monster. You must find that child and bring it here regardless. - [Spencer] At once sir. - I heard that. The whole sorted story. Whatcha going to make of the bastard, another slave or another heir? - I have no intention of taking you into my confidence, however it still has to do with a child of mine. (upbeat music) - [Spencer] Excuse me Reverend Foster. - Yes. - Has anyone left a black baby here? - A black baby no. - Thanks, bye. Hey you, have you seen a Negro with a baby in arms. - [Slave] Oh no Master, no I haven't seen anything. - Set it right there. Yeah that's right. Come on, let's go. - Stay where you are. Wait! I want to talk to you. Have any of you seen a Negro with a baby? (all saying no in turns) Come on you know something. Like that is it. (whip cracking) (grunting) (whistling) Take them away, I'll question them later. March. So you to don't know any thing? - No, no Master, no. - Come over here. Now you're gonna talk. You're gonna talk. - [Slave] I don't know nothing. - Come on tell me. Or is this a conspiracy of silence against me. Talk come on. I'll kill you. (grunting) Kill you. I searched all over the plantation, and further off, but no results at all. They prefer to die than talk. - You idiot. Idiot, scum, I should kill you instead of the Negros. - Well I did all that I could. - All eh? And did you think to question that bitch of a midwife? - [Spencer] Yes I did. So much so, that she died without revealing anything. - Why get out you. Rhonda. Rhonda, you gotta help me to forget. Forget, that's all I want. I don't wanna give you a child. Just forget. - I wouldn't dream of giving you one. It's enough that your son will be coming home soon. I would never, never tie you down in such a way my dear. (grunting) (soft music) (water sloshing) - [Richard] It's about time. He's become a man. In fact he looks like an English gentleman. Help him Spencer. - [Spencer] Welcome home Master Clarence. - Oh thank you. Father, Father, how nice to see you again. - [Richard] Clarence, you're home at last boy. - Rhonda. - [Rhonda] I thought you hadn't recognized me. - [Clarence] It's true that some years have relapsed since we last met but how could I ever forget you. - [Richard] Just a minute there boatman. - [Clarence] If I must say so, you've turned into a most beautiful woman. - Thanks Clarence. And I would like to return the compliment, and say you are a very handsome fellow. - Thanks. - Clarence, you remember Spencer don't you? - Oh but of course. How are you Spencer, it's good to see you again. - It's all my pleasure Master Clarence. - I do hope you haven't returned from England with too many fanciful notions. I always wanted you to be a gentleman in every way, but do remember, around here you see, most of the people are extremely simple, and life is difficult. You'll see living conditions are pretty rough, and so there's not much time for refinement. - Yes, I'm aware of that. For that reason I've toughened up my physique. I'm very strong, don't doubt it, and at rowing and riding, I was always amongst the first to finish. - You'll see how easy it is to adapt yourself. Don't believe what they tell you in Europe, I got used to things at once. And as long as you don't have prejudices, however if you like, I could well help you. - Certainly Rhonda with great pleasure. - Well my boy, your journey isn't finished yet. We should leave for home. There's still quite a long way to go. Distances are very great out here. I don't know whether you remember. - Yes of course. - Well then, the tired traveler deserves a place next to me in the trap, and you have your horses. (upbeat music) You found the plantation greatly changed. And changed for the better. Your father is a great worker. A man full of courage and vigor. Even if the years are catching up with him. - Don't say that, he still looks very young to me. - Of course, there's plenty of life in him yet, and he's extremely proud of you Clarence. - Here they are at last. Well young man, you sure took your time. I know I said the distance was great, but you seemed to have doubled it. well the old men got home first. But it doesn't matter. No rush. Spencer and I took our time to you know. Well I... I imagine you've had time to look around the plantation. - She made me aware above all of your great work, and she's certainly very enthusiastic about you. She speaks in such fervor that I don't know-- - Well I don't need her enthusiasm. I just need someone willing to work with me. Right, tomorrow we'll start by visiting the plantation. It's a big plantation, so it's gonna take us some days, then in a couple of weeks we'll go off together to the annual cattle fair, here at Baton Rouge. There you learn how to do business. Experience is the best teacher. You learn things that you haven't been book taught. Well come on now my boy. What we need's a good dinner. - I've personally prepared two specialties of my own invention, and now let's see if you like them. (cattle mooing) - Yes, now Mister Hunter, these are yearlings, however-- - You don't need to explain boy, cattle hold no secrets from me. When you're looking at cattle, you have to watch out for three things above all, the hooves, the horns, and the hides. These don't impress me much. I offer you half the asking price. - But Mister Hunter, this is the lowest motion I can make. - Father, if the cattle don't fall sick within four months, we could offer him a bonus, what do you think of that? - [Seller] Four months seems a little too long. Two months is enough to discover any sickness. - What do you say Spencer, do you go along with that? - [Spencer] I don't think it's such a bad idea, and I think that three months would be just right. - [Seller] Okay, it's a deal. - [Clarence] We must decide on the bonus. - [Spencer] Well done Mister Clarence, you drive a shrewd bargain. - [Clarence] Well you seem to got on all right. - [Richard] How much? (talking over one another) - [Mary] Good morning. - Morning gentlemen. I know you're doing business, but I would like to talk about the church. It is becoming a very dilapidated building. I've done all that I possibly could, but now I expect my parishioners to come to aid. We need some finances to do some repairs. - Have you ever been to this fair before? - [Mary] No, no this is the first time, and you. - No, I've never been here either. - They're beautiful buffaloes, (soft music) I'm quite fond of all animals really, aren't you? - Say, what about you and me taking a little walk together? - But really I-- - Oh, come on let's go. - Well I ought to ask first at least. - Who your father? We'll ask him later. - [Mary] No, I think I better now, he's very strict. - The roof rather than repelling the rain, appears to welcome it, thus an umbrella is almost called for, and when I think of the pews, words gentlemen fail me. - Reverend. - Father. - [Foster] Where were you, I was beginning to worry? - This gentleman has offered to show me the fair. - [Foster] This gentleman, would do well to present himself first. - My name is Clarence Hunter. - [Foster] Your son. - Yes Reverend, why I never knew you had such a beautiful luscious looking daughter. - Hardly surprising. How could you know. It's been more than 20 years since you've come to church. - Why that's quite a journey getting to your church Reverend. - Then you should build one closer. I would gladly make the trip once a week to hold the service. You should think of God more often. And next Sunday I would like to see you in church, I have some things to tell you. Will you come? - Some think I neglect God Reverend. Yes I'll come. - Now I'll show you the fair. - I'd like to come to Father. I'm very interested in seeing the church. - Yes, I can see how interested you are. - Happy is the man, who is blessed by God, who cares for and comforts him in his plight, and who guides him to the eternal truth, away from the shadows of error. God is the salvation of the soul from death, and will always hold at bay every evil from the soul. He who will have faith in the Lord, will not tremble neither from injustice, nor from suffering. God is the shepherd and he will conduct you into the green pastures of Heaven, toward auditude. The proud shall be humiliated, and the humble shall be exalted. He who obeys the word of God, will be saved for eternity. But he who hasn't obeyed will not avoid eternal damnation. Brothers we should meditate deeply on the words of the scriptures, in order to guide us on our daily life. Especially when we have sinned against the fellow man. How many times unfortunately have we done unto others that which we would feign having done unto us. We should not think of God only in our times of sorrow and death, but should ask ourselves, at the end of the day, have I sinned in the eyes of God? Let us try to combat this with all of our strength. (upbeat music) - Giddy up. You know Rhonda, I'm very glad I've gone back to being a member of the church. - One can see that you're really becoming an old man. - [Richard] Naw, what do you mean? - Well you're surely losing your grip. - Make yourself clear honey. - It will take more than charity to the Reverend Foster to ensure you a seat in Paradise. - Hey, you wouldn't be preaching to me by any chance would you? Why you of all people. What can you offer for the Reverend Foster, in honor to ensure your place in Paradise. - I've given up the best years of my life to ensure my position here with you. - What does that mean? What's on your mind? - Then I'll tell you. It means that the estate is also mine, and I intend to have it when you're no longer here. I've two choices. Either I marry you. - I always said that I will never marry you. As far as that's concerned you got no grounds for complaint. I've been sincere with you. That true? - In that case I'll marry Clarence. - Why you God damned bitch. So that's what you have in mind is it. Over my dead body. - [Rhonda] Richard what's the matter? Don't you feel well? Oh, Richard. - Around here it's like a back water. You know Europe is a hot bed of new ideas, particularly new machines. For work of course. One might say that each day heralds a new invention. That little by little will take over the work done by man. There will no further need for slaves, which amongst other things will be a big saving. - These are things in which I'm ignorant Mister Clarence, but what I do know well is your plantation. I was there at it's birth. (man shouting at animals) And I want see it grow greater. - Certainly I want that to. - Well Mister Clarence, here there are immense riches, the country side is still untamed. - Sure, long hard work getting the best out of the land. - Sure, and I know a bit of what I'm talking about. I'll pass my knowledge on to you. So you will know the best means of benefiting by it. - That's true. - Buffaloes for instance. They can be worth more. - Ah yes? - Certainly, they could be protected to a greater degree. - And how would you go about that? - Yes, well there is a lot to be done. First of all, cattle disease has to be eliminated. - I wasn't just referring to that, but I count upon you and your experience to help me run this property. - Thank you, hey you, come over here. - [Worker] Yes Mister Spencer. - [Spencer] Where is the new buffalo heard? - It was put up North. Bye there Mister Clarence. - [Rhonda] Do you think there will be a war soon? - Women like you always turn war to their own advantage. - I'm more concerned with the plantation, and your son, rather than you. - Yes, I know your concern, but it's certainly not maternal again. - I'm not his mother, and there isn't a great deal in our ages after all. - Well I know you'll like to marry him, but so long as I live, you won't succeed and don't wait for my death, because I've got a long time to go yet. - Well I know I can't expect anything from you. - Well don't expect anything form Clarence. He knows how to take care of himself. My boy, just as he's shown he can take care of this place. - Are you really so sure of him? - What about Rhonda. Of course I appreciate what she's done her, and of course my father's say to, but perhaps he liked her too much for his own good. - Maybe. To each man his own weaknesses. Probably would have been better if your father had been contented with a slave girl. Some of them aren't bad at all, believe me. - Are you proposing I take on a slave girl? It is something I would wish to avoid, not so much a difference of race, but on principle. - There's the new buffalo herd. Look like a pretty healthy bunch don't you think? - Yeah not bad. - Probably have to pay the bonus on 'em to. That's for sure. - Think so? - Or we could make one of them sick. - You'll probably end up infecting the whole herd, which would be a disaster. (soft music) Rhonda, what are you doing? - I feel hot. Besides there's no one around. - Are you sure no one saw you? - No I was careful. He's sleeping very deeply. There's no need to worry about him. Oh Clarence. (soft music) (moaning) (heavy breathing) (whip cracking) (laughing) - How can you laugh like that when a man is being beaten. - He's a spy, he deserves it. - So what would he have to spy on? - [Clarence] He spied on us. - [Mary] Please call him. - [Clarence] No. - [Mary] He's being massacred. - [Clarence] I don't think so, they're very strong you know. - He's not going to get any stronger that way. - I hate spies. (organ music) - Do you like music? - Yes indeed, very much. But I like it better when you're playing. - Oh don't talk nonsense Clarence. Maybe tomorrow we could go for a lovely ride together? (soft music) - Now shut your eyes, I bet you can't keep them closed for long though. You can look now. All this is mine. It's a present my father's given me on the day I decide to get married. - It is beautiful. - [Clarence] I'll give it to you. - [Mary] Don't joke Clarence. - Oh I'm not joking. I'll give it to you but I go with it. - Clarence what are you saying? Are you asking me to marry you? - Finally got the message did you Mary. It was in this room on that bed that my parents spent the very first night of their marriage. Will you spend yours to with me? - Yes Clarence. (soft music) (moaning) (heavy breathing) - Clarence no, no. (gasping for air) (cries of passions) Oh Clarence. (birds chirping) (horses trotting) - Mary, have you been out again with Clarence Hunter this evening? - Why is there something wrong with that? Yes I was out with him. - Mary, you must stop seeing the Hunters. They're not the sort of people for you. Apart from their enormous wealth, the father has notorious habits and drinks heavily. - He's asked me to marry him father. - Not really? - What's that? And what was your reply? - What reply could I give. I love him father. And if you give us your blessing, we'll be married immediately. - But there have been some unpleasant stories about him. - I don't know whether or not he's done those things and why but I know he loves me. - Are you sure of what you're saying? - Yes father, and any case it's too late to change our decision. I'm already his you see. - My God. - [Rhonda] Hello there, does on have to make an appointment to talk to you? You get up at the crack of dawn, and you come home at all hours. - Well what do you want? You know there's a lot to be done this time of year. - Oddly enough, I had the impression you were avoiding me. - No, why the hell should I? - That's what I'd like to know. After all, you didn't seem bored with me the last time, but there must be a reason I guess. - What sort of a reason? - Oh I don't know, perhaps one of a religious nature. - And what do you mean by that? - Simply that some rather interesting information has come my way. My informant's told me of your various pilgrimages to the Reverend Foster. And to his daughter. Don't look at me like that. - I've been aware that you were spying on me. - Let's make love. I need you Clarence. - No, it's quite impossible, I have far too many things on my mind. - I'll make you think of love making. I've thought up some rather marvelous game. - You obey your master's order to the last detail. - [Rhonda] Why did you choose these? - Because I found them making love on the job. - No, it's not true. It's not true, we were only kissing, because we love each other. And that's no crime. Neither one of us has ever made love to another person. We love each other too much. - Alright Spencer. I'll take care of this. (soft music) So you're lovers hmm? - [Slave Girl] Yes we love each other. - In that case your masters will give you a lesson in love making. (moaning) (heavy breathing) - Now what did you hope to achieve by all that? You disgust me. And I'm disgusted with myself. I allowed myself to be carried away with your perversions. But now, everything between us is over. - Feeling remorse? Do you to think of Negros as human beings like us? - No I tell you I detest and despise them. But just because of what we've done it's still more foul. Even more filthy. - Well my dear Clarence, go to sleep and we'll talk about it tomorrow. When your fine scruples have gone. - No, I don't think I'll ever bring myself to talk about this again. - Now do tell me the reasons for your visit. You must now I always enjoy meeting you. - I'm not so sure that you'll be so pleased when you know the real motive for my coming here Mister Hunter. - Gentlemen, you alright sir? - Here you are Reverend. Totally free of alcohol. - You mustn't make me out to be more virtuous than I am. And don't forget the fact that my origins of scotch. - Well we double scotch won't-- - That's enough, that's enough, thank you. - [Richard] To your health. - And yours. - [Richard] Alright then, tell me about it. - The fact is that giddy girl of mine, forgetting the fact that her father is just a poor minister of God, who must rely on the generosity of his parishioners in order to carry on his good works, has taken it into her head, well I don't know, how may I put this... - I think my son has taken something into his head to. - Your right, but he has gone one step further. - He was always impulsive. - Mister Hunter, you must not for one moment think that I'm here to demand a shotgun wedding. - Why no Mister Foster. Quite the contrary. It is I whom am honored to say yes. Don't look so worried. The fact is, there aren't many virtuous girls around these parts, and as far as heiresses go, well there are some that are pretty queer looking lot. I mean you've seen them, you know. Clarence is already rich enough. All I want for him is a good wife. And who would be more suitable than the daughter of the local preacher? I realize that you being related to me, (laughing) is mixing a devil with a saint. But that's your business isn't it? I always get on well with a Scots. - And I sincerely pray that the Lord will forever bless your marriage. May God's love be forever with you and with all of your descendants. This to me is no ordinary celebration my children. I would like to add my own sincere wishes for your future. We live in difficult times, but I feel sure that your love will overcome all adversaries. You may now kiss the bride. (clapping) (soft music) - Richard, where are you going? - Spencer's brought some new slaves. I'd like to see them, they're a young lot. - May I come to? - I thought you'd like to. - Let's go. (rhythmic drumming) - Wake up your master's coming. - Well, seems to be quite a choice here. I hope my presence doesn't disturb you. Are they healthy? - [Spencer] Yes sir, healthy and strong. - These two will enter into my service. - Yes Miss Rhonda, as usual you've chosen the best ones. - Come on. Don't make a spectacle of yourself. I realize that you need to replace Clarence. I've always known about you two. But at least you'll do it with dignity. - However that marriage won't last. I know your sort only to well. And Miss Goody-two-shoes won't put up with it. Remember your marriage with my cousin. - That will be enough outta you. You bitch you. You watch your step or I'll -- (grunts) I was your slave when I chose to be, but those days are over. - Why you be careful. You wouldn't be the first woman I've killed. - Mary? Mary? (soft music) What's the matter? Why didn't you wake me up if you couldn't sleep? - You were sleeping so peacefully there, I hated to wake you up. - But have you been up for so long then. I thought you were happy then my darling? - I've never been so happy. Maybe that's why I'm not able to fall asleep at night. Clarence? There's a text in the Holy Bible, that I learned by heart as a small girl, and Mary went to visit Anna, to tell her the good tidings, and together they praised the Lord, because Mary then realized within herself, of the being that she was creating. At the time I didn't understand a word. My mother then explained to me the facts of life. I'm about to bear your child. I feel an immense happiness, but also a great fear. - My love, how long have you been hiding this, this wonderful news from me? - For more than a month, but before telling you my dear. I wanted to be absolutely certain. - You mustn't be frightened darling. I'll always be near to you. Now more than ever. (breathing heavily) - He's not at all well. - Father it's me. - Clarence, how's Mary? - It won't be long before she goes into labor. That's why she couldn't come and visit you today. - My boy, I want you to go to the lawyers, and bring back Webster my lawyer. I wanna change my will. - Right I'll go. If that's what you want me to do father. - Clarence, aren't you going to say hello to me? - Forgive me, goodbye Rhonda. - Listen. Can we not go back to being friends? - With another concept of the word friendship. Friends as we were, we can never be again. - You left me. And I felt bitter towards you for a long spell, but now it's all gone. - Is this true, what you're trying to tell me? - Yes it's true. - Alright then. Will you warn my wife, that I'll be away for some days? New Orleans is far away. (crying out in pain) - Inez? Where's my husband? - That I don't know Miss Mary. Oh, perhaps that's him. No it's not the master but Miss Rhonda. Miss Mary. - It's starting. - [Inez] Would you watch over her while I get some hot water? - Wouldn't it be better to call a doctor? - I've had 11 children. - Yes, Negros. - We're all born in the same way Miss Rhonda. (scoffs) - Tell me, where's Clarence. - He's going to New Orleans. He'll be back soon. Calm yourself Mary. Calm. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Relax, it's quite normal. There now calm, calm. (screaming) (baby crying) (upbeat music) Here, here's your son. Look at him. - [Mary] It all seems like a nightmare. Everything was so beautiful. - Whoa. - I'm frightened Rhonda, I'm frightened. - But of what, no one will look for you here? - But how will you tell Clarence? How will you put it? He'll never believe you. - Of course he will. I know of another case, the result of a fright. Have you perhaps seen a slave being tortured? - Yes, it made a dreadful impression on me. - You see, that's the reason. Either that or it's slave black magic. You see-- - But who could hate me so much? I've never hurt anyone. - One can never tell. Negros are often unpredictable and sometimes savage. You better go. - Will you swear not to let Clarence find me? At least until he's been convinced, until you've managed to calm him down a bit. Tell him I haven't betrayed him. - Yes certainly. The moment you'll be able to return home safely, I'll let you know. - Will you swear not to let Clarence find me. At least until he's been convinced, until you've managed to calm him down a bit. Tell him I haven't betrayed him. - Yes certainly. The moment you'll be able to return home safely, I'll let you know. - Thank you Rhonda. You've saved my life. - Take heart, and be careful nobody sees you. (rhythmic drumming) - Reverend, Reverend Foster. - What is it, what's happened? Speak in heaven's name. - Reverend it's all my fault. - What fault, tell me, what's happened? - More than 20 years ago there was a Mandingo slave girl on our plantation who was raped by Mister Hunter. When she gives birth, something strange, the girl child what was born have a white skin. The mother was terrified that the child would be murdered, so she begged us before she died to hide the baby, in such a way, that Mister Hunter would never find out. She would give it to me, and she was all white, no one could have figured she was a amalled or it happened sometimes. (baby crying) (organ playing) I leave her there without saying nothing. - Eliza come here. Eliza. - What's the matter? - Look. I found it here a shorty while ago. - I wonder how it got here. - I don't know. - What's this? - Perhaps it's a means of identification. - What should we do? Should we take her to the sheriff? - We have no children. God has sent us one. - She really has a beautiful smile. Please get me some milk. She grows right before your eyes. Isn't she strong. - [Foster] Strong and beautiful. No one around here has recently given birth, and the Whites are few and far between. - And who could raise her better than us? - If we can't find the mother, we'll adopt her ourselves, thus she'll become our daughter. - And you know after the loss of our son, I'm no longer able to have any children. - May heaven always preserve her. She'll be a real daughter to me. - And for me she will always be a miracle. - Good morning Rhonda, everything going alright? - Just dandy. - I was thinking, how's Father? - Much better. - And Mary? Will it be long now before she starts? Tell me? - But what? Didn't Spencer tell you? - Well tell me everything. Has she given birth? - Yes, everything went very well indeed. I myself assisted at the birth. - Oh well, that's just marvelous. Thanks Rhonda. Father, already up? - Yes, I'm much better. Have you heard? - Yes, I'm rushing off to see Mary now. - I'm sorry I can't come with you. - No Father, you must look after yourself. I'll bring Mary and our son here. - He's a very becoming infant. You can tell he's from a strong strain. - Oh Father, by the way the lawyer is here. - I'll see him later. - Very well. - Miss Mary, good news. Miss Rhonda sent me to tell you that everything has been resolved, and that you can go back home. Your husband will be home soon. - Thanks be to God and Rhonda together with him. Let's go. - Clarence. - Mary. Our son. What? (intense music) What does this mean? - [Mary] Didn't Rhonda explain it to you? - No, but it seems very clear to me. - What are you going to do? - To kill you and that little bastard to. - [Inez] No Master, I swear she's innocent. - May you and your whole race be cursed. - It's not Miss Mary's fault you know Master. - Oh yes, then perhaps you can explain to me how such a thing could possibly happen. - Why are you looking at me in such a way Richard? - Because I feel satisfied. I feel I've just done the first good thing in my life, in my last will and testament. - Why, what have you done? - I've just disinherited you. I'm leaving all my wealth to Clarence and his wife. - Oh yes. First time I've ever heard that one could name his beneficiary a dead woman. - What's that you say? - If I'm not mistaken your son is killing her at this very moment. - What the devil do you mean? - That Mary has given birth to a beautiful little baby, but a Negro, understand. The little virgin must have gone to bed with a Negro. - That's impossible, you're lying. - No I'm not lying. It's the absolute truth. Where are you going? - That can't be true, get outta my way. - You're not leaving this house. Leave it to Clarence to deal with her. - You! (Gasping) - Master, Master what has you done? - Come with me Moses. We must get hold of Clarence. - Hunter listen to me. I'll explain how a Negro child came to be born. Mary is absolutely blameless in this matter. She never deceived Clarence with a Negro. I assure you she's innocent. It's been simply an appalling and cruel joke that destiny inflicted on her. The day that my wife an I found her. - Then she's not your daughter. - She was abandoned in our church, shortly after birth, and we adopted her as our own child. She had this around her neck. A Mandingo amulet. - By heaven she's my daughter. (intense music) Hold still. Quickly come with me now. - She'd have gone towards the river in order to find me. I'll follow you. (gun shooting) Whoa. Over this way. (gun shooting) Clarence stop. Stop Clarence. (baby crying) There I intended to save you. She was a daughter of my slave girl. - What? - That child is your son. - Mary? Mary? Forgive me. - Mandingo. (sad music) - Oh Mary. Oh I loved her so much. - Blood of my blood. And flesh of my flesh. Your grandma was a daughter of a Mandingo chief. I shall christen you Mandingo. - Pride is the greatest sin. Christ taught us, that we should all be brothers. But now we see to have forgotten. Your sorrow is also his. Let's pray that the day will soon dawn when there's no more slavery anywhere.
