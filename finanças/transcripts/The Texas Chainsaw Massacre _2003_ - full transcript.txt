The film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of 5 youths. It is all the more tragic in that they were young, but had they lived very, very long lives, they could not have expected, nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day. For them, an idyllic summer afternoon became a nightmare. For 30 years, the files collected dust in the cold-cases division of the travis county police department. Over 1,300 pieces of evidence were collected from the crime scene at the hewitt residence. Yet none of the evidence was more compelling than the classified police footage of the crime-scene walk-through. Test, test, test. Ok, uh... this is august 20, 1973. The time is 3:47 p.m. Our location is the hewitt residence on route 17. That's where victim one was found. We're gonna do a walk-through, and we're now descending the stairs into the furnace room. Uh... there's... over here. There's scratch marks along the wall. There's some more over here, right along here. And... oh, there's something over here. It seems like... it looks like a clot of hair and an embedded fingernail. All right, we're gonna go move into the actual furnace room. The events of that day were to lead to one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of american history... the texas chainsaw massacre. Hold on! Hold on! Don't let go! Not yet! Not yet! Yeah! Now! Now! Let go! Big wheels keep on turning would somebody please make her stop singing? Carry me home to see my kin i think you got a beautiful voice, baby. Thank you. Ha! I miss alabamy once again and i think it's a sin, yes can you believe... we didn't even know each other yesterday? I know. It's just amazing. Mmm! You know what's even more amazing? Hello? Hello? What are you, like at a pause or half-time? Ok, the fact that 33,000 americans each day are infected with a sexually-transmitted disease, and two-thirds of them are just about your age. Ha ha! Hey, morgan. How are you the expert on the dumbest shit? Sweet home alabama lord, i'm coming home to you what are the odds of you guys passing through el paso just as i started to hitch? I mean, it's like... synchronicity. It's like i.s.d. It's like this shit does not just happen. Oh, baby, they got to play "free bird." Oh, they have to. We paid a fortune for these tickets. Yo, kemp, can you do something about the a.c. Back here? I'm melting. No. But if you or pepper get too hot, you could always take your clothes off. You'd like that, wouldn't you? You are such a perv. Don't listen to him, pepper. Why not? I think he's funny. She's only known you for 19 hours. I've lived with him for 3 years, and trust me, he is not funny. Morgan, hey, let me see that. Careful, man. Thank you. I think i can manage, college boy. Here. Oh, no, thank you. I'm nauseous. Montezuma's revenge. I was like erin... "don't drink the water down there." I didn't. And she didn't drink the tequila, she didn't drink the weed... smoke the weed. Well, maybe i didn't go to mexico to watch you get shit-faced for 4 days. That is what people do when they go to mexico. What did you expect? I don't know. A tear-cut diamond ring that goes right here on my beautiful little finger? You're gonna get your ring someday. I heard that one before. Peace offering. Oops. Oh... that was so not cool. Guys, relax. It's not like we don't have 2 pounds of... oh, right. Shh! What did you say? I don't remember. I'm sorry. I got bad brain cells. Uh, "2 pounds of pot." Does that refresh your memory? Don't listen to him. He's baked, and he's stupid. Baby, will you please tell me that we did not go to mexico to buy pot? We did not go to mexico to buy pot. Hey, come on, baby. Look at me. I am not a dope smuggler, ok? Tell me how much you love me. How much? That much. This much. That much? That's it. That's it. Ok. Give me a kiss. Can you drive possibly, please? Look out! Shit! Oh, shit! You almost hit her. What the fuck was she doing walking in the middle of the road? Asshole. Hello? Hey, are you ok? Boys, that's a bad acid trip walking right there. Hello? Can you hear us? You're gonna get killed doing that. Kemp, stop the van. Fuck that. We got a concert to go to. We're still 3 fucking hours from dallas! Where are you going? We're getting there. Get away. Hey... just need to get away. What? Got to get away. From who? I want to go home. Ok, we can't leave her out here like this. Hey, let us help you, ok? Come on. Come on. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok, man. We'll give you a ride, wherever you want to go. I want to go home. Ok, we can take you home. Um... what's your name? They're all dead. Oh, my god. I am way too stoned for this. Baby, let's find a hospital, ok? You know what? Give me the vaguest idea where there is one, and we'll go there. Um... who's dead? Kemper, didn't your mother ever tell you not to pick up hitchhikers? No. You're going the wrong way. Stop! You're going the wrong way! Hey, hey, hey! Jesus christ. You can't make me go back there. I won't go back there. Back where? He's a bad man. He's a really bad man. He's a bad man. Oh, my god. Oh, shit. You're all gonna die. Drop it. Drop it. Let me out! Oh, my god! Are you all right? It's too much. I'm ok. I'm ok. Aah! Aah! Oh, my god! Let me see. It's all over me! It's gone. It's gone. Look. I could have fucking died out there! We all could have, morgan. Did that just happen? I've never seen anybody die before. Yeah, most people never do. I really don't see how that's helping us right now, man. I don't know why we had to pick her up. Why the fuck did we have to stop? She needed help! A lot of fucking help we did her! Leave her alone. Fuck! I just don't understand. Why did she do it? And why did she have to pick us? Why did she have to pick us? What are we gonna do? I don't know. We're gonna... we're gonna have to call the cops, i guess. Yeah, on the list of bad ideas, that one goes way up there. Are you kidding me? Oh, police officer, please, as you inspect the crime scene, which is now our van, please ignore the colorful pinata filled with marijuana you may just happen to come across, because it played no part whatsoever in the demise of this unfortunate young woman. Listen... keep your goddamn voice down. Easy, easy, easy. Goddamn it. Well, you're not gonna listen to him. What the fuck are you doing? Uh! It's over, man. Kemp, you just can't throw the shit out. You ok? Baby... i'm sorry, ok? I... i did it for us. I did it so we could start a life, you know. I'm sorry. Ok? Well, i'll tell you this much... there's no possible way i'm ever getting back in that van. I guess that's what brains look like, huh? Sort of like, uh... lasagna... kind of. All right, i'll shut up now. I'll tell you this much... the next hitchhiker is shit out of luck. I swear to god. Dude, gas station. Come on, erin. Let's find the bathroom. Well, i'll be damned. Ma'am, we need to report a suicide. Something like this comes along, it makes folks realize how crazy the world is out there. Right. Would you mind calling the sheriff, ma'am? It's gonna cost you 10 cents. You want some pig? Big brothers. I just feel so disgusting. Oh, there's about 6 of them altogether, counting the dead one. Poor thing. It's awful. Well, why don't you ask them yourself? Right. Where did you say you found her again? Ma'am, i already told you. About 10 minutes west of here. About 5 miles west. Ma'am, excuse me. When is the sheriff gonna be here? Sheriff said he's headed over to the old crawford mill. I'm sorry. The what? The old crawford mill. He wants to know if you wouldn't mind driving over there to make your report. Yes. Yes, we goddamn mind. I'm sorry, but how often do girls just blow their heads off in this shit-hole town? All right, just calm down, ok? Let me... i'm sorry. I apologize. But, ma'am, i don't understand. Why the hell won't the sheriff just come out here? Didn't say. He said it would be about 2 hours before he could get here. We're not gonna drive around this town with a dead girl in the back of our van! Young man... what you do is your own business. Come on. Get in. I just want to go home, ok? That's fine. It's starting to stink back here. No worse than the inside of that fucking store. Did you smell that nasty beef shit? Oh, my god. Guys. Hello! Hello? Ain't no sheriff here. I think we should drop off the body and get the hell out of here. Maybe we should vote on it. Kemper, no. Why not, erin? It is a democracy. Well, how would you like it if we just dumped your body out here? I'm sorry. Nobody asked her to blow her head off in our van. My van. I say we dump her. Pig. Cool. All right. Fine. 2 votes. Now we just need one more. Kemper? One more and we're out of here. Kemper, please? Baby, she's dead. I just... i really don't think it matters where we leave her. Well, it matters to me... if that means anything. Erin, look... that girl has got parents out there somewhere who's gonna want her back, not just dumped on the side of the road like a piece of trash. You see our lone ranger anywhere? Maybe this isn't the crawford mill. It's unbelievable. This is a joke. There's nobody here. There's no sheriff here. What? I just saw something move in there. I just saw something. I swear to god, i just saw something move in there. You're just trying to scare me into leaving. Erin, come on. Go to hell. Erin, come on. Quit screwing around. Aah! Kemper! Erin! Erin! Erin, where are you? All right. Go. I got it. Ok. Damn it! Give me... give me something to hold this. It's a possum, indigenous to the... i didn't do that. All right. All right, that's it! If somebody's out there, just stop fucking around, all right? I mean it! Just come on out! Who are you? What did you do to her? Huh? The girl out there, in the van. We didn't do anything to her. She did that to herself. Oh, my god. Promise you won't hurt me? Hey, you make these? Hey, bud. Hey. This is the old crawford mill, right? My name is erin. Jedidiah. Hey, junior. So, we're waiting here for the sheriff. Do you know where he is? Ok. Well... where? Home... getting drunk. So, cool. Um, let's split. If the sheriff doesn't give a shit, then why should we? Does he live around here? You know, front-row tickets to a big concert. Can we drive there from here? Road don't go there. Short walk, though. I think we should go, like now, like right now. How do i get to the sheriff's? Whoa! Hey, you sick little mutant. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on now. Let go. Get out of here. That's police evidence. Is anybody home? Hello! What do you want? Um... are you the sheriff? Do i look like a sheriff? I don't know. I can't see you. Stand back from the door. Sheriff don't live here. You can call him if you want to. Thanks. We'd really appreciate it. Wipe your feet. I like to keep a clean house. I said she could call him. You wait outside. Ok, chief. I ain't looking for trouble. Don't shoot. There. I'll dial him for you. Hello? Hi. Is... is this the sheriff's office? Can i speak to him, please? Oh, thank god. Now, it's just an educated guess, but my money says your dead body is right there in that van. 30 minutes? Believe me, we will be there. Thanks. I'm all set. Wait. Wait. Can you help me out back here? Are you ok? Could you just... ok. Excuse me. Erin? Excuse me. Erin? Excuse me. You mind getting the fuck out of my way, son? We picked her up on the side of the road, like... wow. Look at that mess. Who's this belong to? She had that on her, sir. You don't say. Had it on her? Yes, sir. Ok, if you could just relax, because you're not helping. Good girl, good girl. Pig sty. Oh, jesus. What the hell was that? Kemper? Kemp? Ha. Well, let's get her wrapped up. Oh, preffy little thing. How about giving me a hand here, asshole? You don't expect me to do this by myself? I need some help. Why do i always get yanked into this shit? What am i doing? Lift her up and just kind of pull her over your way there. She ain't gonna bite you. She's deader than a goddamn doornail. Get ahold of her and pick her up. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. There you go. I bet she's real unhappy, real sorry that you're getting fuckin' her blood all over your goddamn arm. You know, back when i was a young patrolman, i used to love wrapping up these young honies. Yeah, i bet you did. Yeah, cop me a little bit of a feel every now and then, you know. Oh, look at that. She's kind of wet down there. What you boys been doing with this dead body anyway? Can we please finish this? Kemper? Kemp? Something wrong? Where is he? I don't know. But he's not in my house. Thanks. Kemper? Kemp? Goddamn him. Ok, boys, there you go. There she is. Let's get her out of there now. You, four-eyes, get a hold of her legs there. Get after that part of it. I got her head. Oh... fuck. Come on. Ow! Shit. Just stick her in the back seat. It just seems so wrong. Don't give me any crap, young lady. Goddamn it, i got just as much respect for a dead body as anybody around here. Hey! Get that nasty goddamn thing out of the back seat of my goddamn car! Put it in the trunk. What the hell's the matter with you? Put the legs. Don't break my stuff. Put the legs in. Y'all gonna be able to find your way out of here ok? Yeah. Yeah, we'll be fine. All right, then. Protect and serve. That's what we do. That you did, sir. Kemp! Kemper! Kemper! Poor kemp. I mean, he ain't ever gonna get the stink out of this van. You think we should try to clean it for him? Be my guest. You ok? It's too much. I'm gonna be sick. Ok, good news. Sheriff's on his way. The sheriff already came. He took the body. Where's kemper? Isn't he with you? Kemper? What the hell is that? Kemper! Kemp! There's nobody even here. Kemp! What was that all about? Kemper! What is that? Oh... it's somebody's fucking teeth, isn't it? Pepper, look, just calm down, all right? Erin, find your goddamn boyfriend. It's time to go. Kemper! Kemp! Morgan, what are you doing? Help him! Help him! Oh, my god! Pull him! Pull him! I can't! Oh, my god. Ha ha ha! You stupid... that's not funny. Oh, what the hell is that? Is that the girl from our van? That's her. Is that her family? What were they all doing here? They were probably looking for the sheriff. It's fucking weird. All right, you know what? Let's find kemper and get the hell out of here. Where you going? To find him. Well, where are the keys for the van? Well, who put you in charge? If you guys just want to take off, that's fine, but i am not getting in that van and leaving without him. Give me the keys. Don't even think about it. Andy... i don't know about you guys, but i happen to like my teeth right where they are. I can't leave him. Let's go. We'll meet you back at the van. I know kemp's in there. Wonderful. All right, keep him busy. Hi. It's me again. I'm really sorry to bother you, but i can't find my boyfriend kemper anywhere, and i thought i would just... ain't you supposed to meet the sheriff? Kemper? Kemp, don't mess around. Um... wow. What... what a wonderful garden you have. It's just so... plentiful. Ha ha. Oh! Damn it! Andy! Hey, you can't just go in my house! Andy! Are you ok? Yeah. What the hell are you doing in my house? All right, look. We're just looking for our friend, all right? Then we'll be out of here. You ain't running things, boy... exceptin' your mouth. This guy's crazy. You little turd, you're so dead, you don't even know it. Come on, boy. Bring it! Bring it. Bring what? Bring it. Shit! Come on! Andy! Get the fuck out of here! Run! Shit! God! Please! Please! Stop! No! Please! Put me... shit! Erin! Erin! Erin! Ugh! Kemper really owes us for this. What the fuck's wrong, erin? Erin, are you ok? Where's the gun? Come on! Erin, what's going on? Where's the gun? The sheriff took it. Shit! Erin, what the fuck's going on? Calm down! Fuck! What? What? Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Take it easy. Thank god. My friend... my friend needs help! My friend right now... my friend's dying! My friend's being hurt! Take a couple of deep breaths. There's some guy... just... just quiet down. Please. Now, what's wrong with your car? There's nothing wrong with my car. Whoa. It's my friend. Please help him. I don't know where he is anymore. Somebody want to explain this? Lt... that's not mine. You kids taking drugs? No. No. It's not our van. I smell bullshit. Get out of the van! Out! On your faces, all 3 of you! Get on the ground! Arizona... colorado... new york. Please, you've got to help us! He's fucking killing him! Now we're getting someplace. Who's killing who? There's some fucking guy with a fucking chainsaw! Get your sweet little ass back in the dirt until i say otherwise. You know what i think? I think your boyfriend shot that little girl and then he ran off. He did not! Some fucking guy with a... stop! Stop! We're all gonna die! You girls better get yourselves under control, or i'm gonna have to do it for you. Why won't you listen to her? Get on your feet. Get over by the van. Please stop. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. I want to know exactly what happened inside that van. We already told you what happened. And now you're gonna show me. Is that where she was sitting? Because the angle don't add up for me with the blood on that back window. Maybe she was a bit more in the middle. Well, maybe you ought to move a little more over to the middle. But... what, are you afraid of a little blood? Get the fuck over there! I don't have much of an imagination, so i need to get a distinct image of what went down here. What did she do next? She... she shot herself. Oh, she shot herself. How? What do you mean, how? Take the gun. Take the gun and show me how she did it. Come on. Take the gun. Take the gun and show me. Take the goddamn gun! Is that how she did it? Yes. Yes, sir. You're a fucking liar. There ain't no hole in the bottom of her chin. I looked. She stuck the goddamn weapon into her mouth. Didn't she? Show me how she did it. Do it! Please... show me. Please, please, please, please, please... that a boy. There you go. And then what did she do? She shot herself. You ain't lying to me again, are you? Because i have never seen a weapon go off without somebody's finger on the fucking trigger. Morgan, what's going on? You ok? You girls stay in the dirt till i tell you different. You mother fucker! Get on the fucking floor! I said get on the floor! What the hell are you doing? What are you gonna do, shoot me? Morgan, please, please. Just please put the gun down, ok? Please don't do it.

He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill all of us. Oh, no, he won't. Yes, he will. He knows better than to be messing around here. Everyone around here knows that... poor sweet boy. Sweet boy. He's no harm. He always keeps to himself. Skin disease. He was just a little boy when it started. Didn't you look at his face? I couldn't. I couldn't look at him. Oh, sweetie. Here. Here.

This is the only known image of thomas hewitt, the man they call leatherface. The case today still remains open.
