Based on a true story. LOST AND FOUND Pardon me... - No, everyone waits their turn. I lost my wallet. - Including you! My wife is lying in... - Don't waste my time! THE FORGER Based on the memoir of the same name by Cioma Schönhaus Cioma! - Come in. Is your family gone already? - Yes, it's been five days. My parents got sent east too. Can I stay with you for a while? - Stay as long as you like. Coffee? - Yes, please. How do you get ration coupons? I don't. The market women give me food for altering their dresses. I can get us some coffee beans. Then we can make real coffee. Psst. Psst. Cioma! Cioma, didn't you study graphic design? Not for very long. Someone's looking for a graphic designer. Do you have a steady hand? I do. You went to drawing school before they had you make weapons? How long did you attend? - Two years. Then I wanted to go to art college. What for? To study art. Architecture would be more profitable. You can't choose what you're passionate about. What you're passionate about? Only child, am I right? - Yes. I studied law, served in the war, earned multiple decorations. CAPTAIN Then I was promoted. I was a proper official, bound to the German nation and rule of law. SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER Do you believe in God, young man? I pray sometimes. For the only child, or for others as well? For others, too, but mostly... I wish for things I can't have. You only want to believe when there's something in it for you. That's too easy. - Probably, yes. Okay. This is an ID card. Switch the photo and fill in the missing stamp. Good forgeries are tiny works of art. Can you do it? It's a very simple question. I think I can. If, one morning, the Gestapo rings your doorbell instead of the milkman and want to search your flat, then I urge you to hang yourself. Yes, sir. The ID cards are collected in the contribution box of my parish at the Confessing Church. On the black market, these ID cards are worth several thousand reichsmarks. But we do this out of decency alone. No one makes money off it. Of course. You live alone? - Yes. Keep it that way. Lock the door when you're working on the ID. Put the tie in your pocket. This is for your work. Put that all away. My wife could walk in at any moment. Thank you very much. Cioma, you know what this is? Half a chicken, from the market women. May I? I'll put your bag under my bed. Mrs Peters from downstairs keeps snooping around. The jacket, too? Let's not get carried away. How old is Mrs Peters? Under 30. Married? - Widowed. Be careful what you tell her. - I always let the women talk. "The women"! Cioma, do you have a sip of white wine for the chicken? - I'm afraid not. What are you doing? I got the photo out, but I need a grommet press. A grommet broke already. - You're forging an ID? I'm trying to. You think I could ask Mrs Peters for a sip of wine? I don't think she'll give you anything. I think she will. Heil Hitler. Criminal Investigation Department. I'm here to assess your mother's possessions. Say, do you have a loo? Nature calls. Yes, right here. Thanks. You stay right there. I wouldn't want you to hide anything. Right. Let's begin. Who sleeps where? That's my room, and my parents' room... is back there. As well as my grandmother's room. The watch isn't on the list. May I keep the photograph? Take it out. If any of those things disappear, I'll have to report it. We mustn't be lenient. - Of course. The light switch? - Right there. Hold this. Right... I'll call it a day. - I'll just get your coat. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Won't you at least lock the door? Or shall I do it for you? No, we'd better not. Who forges with the door unlocked? I do, Det. Maybe people should forge in the park. In the middle of a crowd in broad daylight. Det? Yes? Could you come here for a moment? What do you think? Cioma, I don't like it one bit. But how do you like this? Well, the stamp is darker and blurs at the edges. You're right. Thanks. Yeah, that's pretty good. Would the market women buy this stuff? You don't own it anymore. Technically, no one owns it right now. I'm going to deliver the finished ID. Cioma, I'd ask them to pick it up if I were you. I'll just change clothes. Do you like it? - Yes, very much. I've got two more days, then I have to return to the front. I figured you for one of the boys who got themselves declared unfit? Unfit? Unfit for war. So many young men are getting themselves declared unfit for war. How do they expect us to win the war? You're absolutely right. My thoughts exactly. BARBER AND HAIR SALON Heil Hitler. Dinner for two? Heil Hitler. I'm alone, sadly. If only I weren't. Headed back to the front? - Yes, sir. This "unfit for war" nonsense will lose us the war. Yes, indeed. Do you have a wife waiting for you? No, sadly. Thank you. I'm only 21, but I've already served for three years. You know what? Eat whatever you like. It's on me. That's very kind of you, but... - I insist, young man. You brave the hail of bullets. Order, and don't be modest. Get whatever strikes your fancy. You're a hero. Don't you forget that. I am one of many. - No! You're a hero! What kind of idiotic haircut is that? It's mimicry. Some animals take on the characteristics of their enemies' predators. The etymological origin of the word is the ancient Greek mímos. Did you have ancient Greek in school? No, luckily. Do you have the forged ID with you? Show me. So, this is your work. One of the grommets is damaged. And the circle in the stamp doesn't match perfectly. You said that good forgeries were tiny works of art. This is a far cry from a work of art. How long did it take you? Over an hour, with an interruption. An interruption? Yes. Do you have a forged ID for yourself? More or less. I have a post ID. A post ID? I thought those were for theatre tickets, for the library or for picking up a parcel. Show me your post ID. Why the stains? I know it's terrible, but our housekeeper just washes everything in sight. Oh my! It says "Schönhausen". Any relation to the Bismarcks? - No. Though he was a friend of the family. Leave my house immediately. Go on. I strongly suggest you walk. You're only allowed to take the tram to work. I assume you know that. Everybody's talking about Kaufmann. He's not especially careful. It's good you've stopped. I tend to overestimate myself, at times. As a good friend, you should disagree. Only a bad friend would do that. Cioma? Some market women are coming tomorrow after all. I hope it's not too many. How many are coming? I told them to come in small groups, but nobody wanted to be in the second or third group. Can they be very, very quiet? Very, very quiet? As a rule... no. Schönhaus! Your cigarette is stinking up the whole house! Help me, will you? LIGHT ATTRACTS BOMBS Hang it up. No lights in the stairwell after dark! Why do people break the rule! The light was on just the other day! Why do I bother to tape the switches and hang the signs? I know full well, you don't darken the windows in your back room either! Schönhaus, you only have one room left. The rest no longer belongs to you. You're aware of that I hope? You can't have visitors anymore either. You're aware of that too? Of course. Good. Heil Hitler. Mr Schönhaus? - Yes. Come on! - Nice that you've made it. Please. Quiet on the stairs. We have sensitive neighbours. We'll be like church mice! Yes, come in. To the left. Thank you very much! We hope you all have a wonderful time. Just remember to be nice and quiet. Close the door if we're going to get naked. How many metres are left on this? At least ten. - I'll take it. The blue check fabric is mine! All of it. What? All of it? That's what I said. Then I'll take this. All of it. Go on then. It's your last chance. Go on! Can I get some more? - Yes, of course. I've got to wee! - No! And suddenly it's normal, right? Good day, everyone. I don't mean to interrupt. But nothing you see here still belongs to him. Mm-hmm. Take that brooch off. And get dressed, back there! Where is your colleague? Your mother already gave the list to the Jewish Community, transferring her possessions. You were there! I was there. - What you're doing here... You could be shot for this! You know that! No need to duck, back there! Look at me! And you! And you! You'll all stay right here and you'll put everything back where it belongs. No one is taking anything with them. And keep your mouths shut. You'll be as quiet as church mice, understood? And you come with me! Make yourself useful. They tampered with the stove. Smoke poisoning. The Jewish funeral services can't keep up. Put them in your cellar space till they arrive. The Birnbaum's didn't have one. Well? Swallow it! Good evening. May I? I realize that was unpleasant but you understand why I asked you. It's only proper that you clear away your own kind. My husband was the block warden. You can't invite market women. A ton of women cackling on the stairs who'll go out and tell everybody about their shopping spree! What on earth were you thinking? Everyone would know! How would that make our house look? My sister got bombed out and sleeps with her children on the bare kitchen floor. Those beds back there... are of no use to anyone now. Are they? It can all be sold. You two can wait in my flat. You'd only make buyers nervous. Lots of people get rich off the belongings of those deported east. And the Party bigwigs take the lion's share. I'll sell it all for you. Then I want you gone. Understand? I know your exemption is expiring. And you don't even have one, right? As soon as I've sold your things, I want you out of here, understood? Can you speak? - Understood. Good. Then I wish you gentlemen a good evening. Schönhaus, if you're late again, forget about your exemption. I'll bring you to Levetzowstrasse myself. Yes, sir. Spare me that crap. Back to work! Shall we borrow some uniforms? - Uniforms? I worked there for two years. - So? A naval officer brings us his damaged uniform. But the poor sod is ordered back to duty. So he gets a new uniform. We repair his old one, and it just hangs there waiting for its new owner. You know what, Det? The navy is more than just the military. It's family and freedom. - Oh really? Yes. The navy is more than just the military. It's family and freedom. - Care for another? Yes, please. You don't choose the navy. The navy... chooses you. Don't overdo it. You don't choose the navy, the navy chooses you. Would one of you care to dance? Yes, I'd like that. May I? The navy is more than just the military. It's family and freedom. You don't choose the navy. The navy chooses you. Is that right? May I? Of course. Comrade, this young lady wishes to show me photos from her holiday in Italy. It's about time you headed home. - I'm as good as gone. Mr Schönhausen? Your wallet. Thank you! Did you get caught in the rain with your ID? The housekeeper washed it. A navy man with a housekeeper? - How about a reward? Ration coupons? I have a few left over from my last holiday. You go on holiday? - Once in a while. That's not true. I'll turn the light on once we've closed the door behind us. My fiancé is at the front. Do you have the coupons? All of them? - They're your reward. Then I'll follow you, hoping you lose more. You won't have to wait long. I'm always losing things. Is that right? - Yes. Close your eyes. No! No, no, no! What? I should've been at Genschow's at 7:00. Say you're sick. - I can't. You can only be late twice a year, and I was already. He's going to fire me. Then my exemption will expire. Listen up, you navy soldier with a housekeeper who's actually a factory worker. If I help you, I want you to share your next ration coupons with me. All of them. Okay. What's your real name? Cioma Schönhaus. Stop thinking. - Stop thinking? Yes. I hear your mocking tone. If you work at Genschow's, you'll need a star. Do you have a star? You can have this one from my old jacket. You'll have to drop this somewhere. When your appendix is infected, it doesn't hurt until pressure is relieved. So, right... now. When did this pain start? I can't say, but it's bad. You sneak to your workbench one and a half hours too late, and you think I won't notice? - I'm very sorry. I bet you drank too much last night, but feel free to see the company doctor. I'd like that. - Go ahead. Hurry it up. Yup. Can you sit up? There. Off to the clinic with you. I don't think it's that bad. We don't have a minute to lose. Where are you off to? He yelled as I relieved the pressure. It's his appendix. I'm taking him to hospital. Come with me, please. No, we must go now. There's not a minute to lose. Just give me a minute, please. - Sit down. You're not taking that Jew bastard anywhere! It's a life and death matter! - The Jew will take the bus. We're all equal before God. - We're all equal before God? Who says? - The Bible. Fuck the Bible! The Jew will take the bus. I'm horribly sorry. So, that means you're fired? Yup. What if they'd taken you to hospital? They didn't. You can't stay here. My fiancé is on the front. He thinks I'll marry him. And maybe I will. If he comes home in one piece. But if I want to eat, I have to keep dating. You have to go. I don't have anywhere to be. But I do. Did you have a nice evening? Why aren't you at Genschow's? I slept late and feigned a burst appendix too well. So what now? If you're not working, you'll lose your coupons and your exemption! Yeah, probably. Cioma, you know what's at stake. Don't you see that? I'll go to the market women, see if I can get some food. GERMAN REICH ID CARD I'll put it this way, it's not total rubbish. Walter Heymann was here. He said you were in hospital. On death's door. - I lied too well. I merely overslept. Here are four ID cards. The photos have been changed. I'll get you a room. You can't stay in your flat much longer. And Genschow would've fired you anyway. Wounded veterans will take those jobs now. This is for you, too. Don't meet anyone. And start your work immediately. You know what, the coupons are a gift. What's wrong? Mrs Peters is up there selling our stuff. This is yours, Mr Schönhaus. They paid upfront? - Yes. The marked items will be collected. For my part, I'd like a receipt for what I've chosen. I wouldn't want your whole family showing up at my door wanting it back. Please, take what you like as payment. No, I insist. When will you move out? - We've found a small room. Very nice. I'm happy for you. I don't wish you any harm, trust me. Yes, I know you believe that. And you'll hang the chandelier for me later? Did you hang the lamp? Yup. It's up. Come on, let's go. Yeah, let's go. Come in. I'm Jani. - Cioma. -Detlev. We're setting up a kind of forgery workshop. A woman from my church has cleaned out her dead mother's grocery store for us. The war is over. The people out there just won't admit it. But people believe what they want to believe. What did you call it? Mimicry. But we mustn't get reckless. A Mr Lichtwitz will be assisting you. He's 20 years your senior and only speaks when spoken to. But Schönhaus, go on telling people what they want to hear. Just like Hitler has been doing for years. Yes? Oh, Helene. - Here are the new ID cards. This is our Mr Schönhaus. Helene... Jacobs. Mrs Jacobs, Splittergasse 8? - Miss Jacobs, Bonner Str. 2. Oh, I confused you with a friend of my mother's. Your address is no one's business. No, of course not. - Already forgotten. If only that were true. Thanks. Schönhaus, you'll be working on a "wonder weapon". But no one can know. No one. So it's a military secret. A military secret? What kind of military secret? I'm not allowed to say. But if any of these objects disappear, I'll have to report it immediately. I hope you understand. We mustn't be lenient. Hans, I hear that, you know! Hands on your knees! Not another peep out of you! The block warden and I are friendly. We're in the Party. Peter Schönhausen. I trust you've forgotten the name. Of course. Good. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. The electrical material is in the shed, on the shelf in front of the window. If anyone looks in, they'll see all that expensive stuff. Good. A grommet press! Don't worry. I'm sending them to myself. You're sending yourself postcards? Oh, Mr Schönhausen! "Mr... Schön... ...hausen. - Mr Schönhausen. "I wish you more... than simply... success." "A defeat... would be nothing less... than a catastrophe." We don't even have a letter box. - I'm sure it'll find us. Mr Schönhausen. JANUARY 1943 Would you like to come in? This is not my flat. I don't want you looking sideways at anything in here. Don't go snooping in drawers while I'm making coffee. Don't go looking at anybody but me. Don't go sniffing anyone else, just me. Okay. Dark violet, light violet, white, striped, polka dotted, brown and... blossoms! Blossoms this big! So, my dear Johannes, won't you give us a tulip rhyme? Won't you tell me your name? What for? I want to know who I lie next to in bed. Next to me, of course. Or is there anybody else in there? And if you had a new ID, what name would you write in it? Gitte or Gerda. We had three Gerdas in my school. Gerda Meyer, Gerda Schulze, and Gerda Weiss. Gerda Weiss. How long have you known her? Not very long. - "Not very long". Then you come to my house, and have the chutzpah to ask me to get her an ID card? Rudolf Neubauer sure is pretty. - Oh! I guess I'll have to switch the photos. You sleeping at all these days? Not much. Get those sorted out by tomorrow. I'll give you the new ID cards. You are aware that there are women in Berlin who betray illegal Jews to the Gestapo, right? Do you still have your tie? Did you name names? - No. Did you say where you get the ID cards? I mentioned neither names, nor supplier, nor the location of the workshop. I know you'll go back to this woman. Thank you. You don't have to bring me flowers. It's mimicry. Should I give them back once we're outside? Look at it this way, I'll give them to you again tomorrow. Mr Schönhausen! I accepted a post card for you. Oh, thank you. Making progress? - Working night and day. We in the house see to it that you can work in peace. I appreciate that very much indeed. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. This house is a blessing. Two blank Wehrmacht IDs would be a blessing. Hm? You underestimate the world out there and overestimate your role in it. I value the world too much not to play a role in it. See you later for lunch? All right. May I ask where you're going? - Just out to lunch. I'll be back in two hours. What's wrong with the bread over there? Nothing's wrong with it. But this way, I can deliver the finished ID cards. I wouldn't walk through the city if you can help it. Plus it's very cold. You're right. I'll take the bus. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Mr Schönhausen, may I bring you a vase? Yes, that would be lovely. Mr Schönhausen, I'm honoured that you bring me flowers every day. My pleasure. There you are. - Thank you very much. Pardon me. Do you have chocolate tart today? There's a war on. - Oh. So you don't have any? - There's a war on. Cioma, I'm afraid I have to go. Yes. What's wrong? I had it, when I was on the bus. - Check your jacket. It was in my trousers. The lost and found! Don't go. - I'll be right back. No one hands in a wallet! - Be right back. May I? - Please. My fiancé has the bad habit of losing everything. Shall I bring you something else? No, thank you. LOST AND FOUND Pardon me. - No, everyone waits their turn. I lost my wallet. - Including you! My wife is lying in... - Don't waste my time! I'll take the key to the flat. The insolence! Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. When did Mr Schönhaus move out? He doesn't live here anymore? He's probably in hiding. He's got enough money. From the sale of impounded valuables. He sold valuables? Yes. That's hard for me to believe. We must all stick together. - Yes, we must. Yes. - Yes. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Your ID cards, please. Thank you. There you go. Your ID card, please. Thank you. - There you are. Thanks. Why don't you check his ID? He's obviously in the Party. Party pins are sold on the black market. I've been in the Party since '39. Since the beginning of the war? So late? Why aren't you at the front? You don't look that old. I served in the First World War when I was seventeen. "Unfit for war". It'll cost us this war! Your names? Frieder Schulze. - And you? -Albert Schwarz. May I see your ID cards? Both of you, please. SERVICE ID CARD CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPT. BERLIN They look good. I won't report you this time. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Pardon me, did anyone hand in a wallet with the initials "P.S." engraved on it? "P.S." stands for... - Peter Schönhausen. One moment. This here? It was handed in two hours ago. Pardon me, I lose everything that's not tied to my body. Here you are. - Our friend's food... I'll pay that as well. - The chocolate tart? Yes, sir. Thank you very much. - Thank you. I left my wallet on the bus after all. But someone turned it in. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. That's unheard of in any other European capital, but in Berlin, people's hearts are in the right place. Yes. So, next Monday at eight? - I'd like that. Very nice. Your food has been paid for. See you. - Thank you. Next time it's on me. - I'd like that. I'll ask Mr Kaufmann. I'm sure he knows someone you could stay with. Soon I'll get you an ID, give you money and you'll go to Switzerland. You don't even have a proper ID yourself. Your laundered post ID is laughable. You're dangerous. - I'm here for you, Gerda. My name isn't Gerda! And no! I'll manage alone. Don't do this. Don't do this. Go. Don't ruin the ID card. May I ask you something? Mr Kaufmann told me that your wife left you. Yes, that's right. Then why do you still wear your ring and put up her picture? I haven't left her yet. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Where are you even going? I... was going upstairs to Mrs Lange. Mrs Lange lives on the first floor. Oh, then... I'll go back down again. - Do that. Thanks. They're getting thinner, not fatter. At least I won't have to slaughter them. Stay. Wait and see. Thanks. You've helped so much already. Thanks so much. Walk a little faster, Cioma. We're not hiding, Det. Yes, that's exactly what we're doing. Oh. What? It really was untied. Very funny, Cioma. We won't sleep here. No, we'll sleep in the shed. Another thing about Kaufmann. If it wasn't for his Jewish mother, he'd still be in the Wehrmacht, shooting our people in the East. I'm freezing cold. In the end, it doesn't matter why people do good. I'm doing it for the ration coupons. You wouldn't help for free? That's irrelevant. We would've starved without coupons. Maybe we just need to get warm and eat some good food. Probably. I'll take the cold wall. Tell me, did you forge the birth date? How could you tell? I couldn't. I just happen to know how old he is. We served together. He's one of my closest friends. I was worried because he's 20 years younger than the original ID owner. I was worried about that, too. How did you change it? - With erasing fluid. I saw an ad at the cinema. - You go to the cinema? With your post ID? - I know the owner... I don't want to know! And I'm certain that you don't walk home from here. You only say that to pacify me. I'm sure you still take the bus and the tram. It's three hours on foot. I will do my best to find two blank Wehrmacht ID cards. That is not an empty promise just to lift your spirits. I will do my best. I know that. This is a tiny work of art. Move out! Thank you. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. We only accept coupons. Not everything is available. - Of course. I have holiday ration coupons. I'm passing through. You're passing through? Yes, my family was bombed out. I'm staying with a friend. And your holiday? Um, I'm going to Cologne. To my aunt's. May I take a look at your ID card? Yes, of course. - Back in the capital? Yes, the Rhineland just isn't my cup of tea. I understand. Will you be dining with us today? No, I'll have a hot cocoa with a shot of rum. I'm afraid our cocoa is thinned with water. Excellent. These are my ration coupons, and... I must've left my ID card at home. No problem. Won't you step outside for a moment? Yes, of course. One moment, please. Here you are. - Thank you. I'd like to pay. I'm sorry. Would you like something else? No, it's fine. That's not necessary. You hardly drank anything. Are you feeling well? - I'm great, thanks. We need an original. The IDs are useless without one. Let's ask Kaufmann. - We can't. Kaufmann could be arrested any minute now. I'm going to ask Kaufmann. - No! I don't know any soldier who'd lend us an ID. I switched to a Jewish school. He stayed at the regular school till the end. He has Wehrmacht connections! - I live in a cellar! I can't just walk around out there like you! I'll find someone. No. Please! Please. I'll scream! I'll scream! - Let me in, or I'll tell them you sold our things. You think they'd believe you over me? - Probably not. This was given to me so I could hang myself. Help me, or I'll hang myself right here. You don't have it in you. Don't turn me away. - There's no way I'm hiding you! I need a Wehrmacht ID card. Do you know anyone who'd lend me one? - To forge an ID? Are you mad? No one would know it's from you. I didn't help because I like you, but because Party bigwigs are greedy. I was fair, I never embezzled! My parents taught me that... Help me. You can tell your children how you saved me. I can't tell anyone that. You are a good person. - Stop it. If I try to find you an ID card, then I'd like something in return now. Give me all the ration coupons you have left. Heaven knows where you get them. I'm starving, and you show up with four holiday ration coupons! Go up to the flat. If I haven't knocked by tomorrow, I couldn't find an ID, and you disappear before dark. Understood? I won't give you food. Don't use the toilet, don't walk around, and don't turn on the faucet! Understood! Yes. I have an ID card. I need it back in three days. Thank you. Could you lend me a blanket? - No! No one can find things of mine up here! I got you the ID! Stay in the flat. I'll lock you in. Stay here until I collect you. Got it? You have a black spot on your face. Look in the mirror. All the mirrors are gone. WEHRMACHT ID "Passed physical examination." "Liable for compulsory military service." Heil Hitler, Mr Dietrich. Can I help you? Maybe you can tell me where Mr Schönhaus is staying? How should I know? I'm not his maid. Yes, but maybe the two of you are close. I assume you are, considering the pretty lamp in your living room. He forges IDs, you know. We think he has forged more than 300 IDs for people who have disappeared into thin air! So, I'm going into the flat. You can't just break down the door! I have a key from Reich Security. Fine. Then take a look. - I will. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Everyone to the air raid cellar! To the air-raid cellar! Everyone to the air-raid cellar. You too. Yeah, yeah. Drop everything and report to the air-raid cellar! Everyone to the air raid cellar! Oh no! No, no, no! BERLIN RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS Heil Hitler. - Evening. Ah, you're a war hero! War hero? Nonsense! A comrade shot me in the knee while cleaning his gun. BERLIN RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS Have you finished? Tell this man, I'm forever grateful! When the war is over, I'll... - The war isn't over! I bet you wish the war was over! I can't tell that man a thing. He's dead. - I'm sorry. No you aren't! Why do you think that? Why? It doesn't matter at all, why I say that. You've got what you wanted from me. Now please go! You know... Our lamp you bought for one reichsmark is worth 100 times that. You wrote the receipt. - Yes, but... Consider it a gift. Don't worry. I won't ever show up at your door, or ask to have anything back. I don't need anything... from anybody. And with a bit of luck, this ID will get me through the war, then I'll give people the feeling that everything's okay. Everything's okay. Find a place to sleep. I'll never sleep again. I'll stay awake till I die! Then you'll probably die soon. You're acting like a crazy person. It's a glorious day! I'll head off then. - Please do. I'm not stopping you! Thank you. - I didn't do anything. Of course not. Helene Jacobs hid Cioma in her Bonner Str. 2 flat. After her arrest, Cioma fled. He biked across Germany and into Switzerland. There he became a graphic artist and fathered four sons. Cioma lived to be 92. Det Kassriel was deported to Auschwitz where he was murdered. Gerda was deported and died in a concentration camp. Franz Kaufmann was shot dead at the Sachsenhausen camp on 17.02.1944. Cioma's parents, Boris and Fanja, and grandmother, Marie Bermann, were deported and murdered in the Sobibor and Majdanek death camps. Ludwig Lichtwitz was arrested in September 1943. He escaped on 17.11.1943, survived the war and got back together with his wife.
