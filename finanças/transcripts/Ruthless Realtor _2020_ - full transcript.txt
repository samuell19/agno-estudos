The cell service is better than I thought it'd be way out here in the sticks. No. No, no, no. No more work calls. No more work calls. I'm all yours. Thus begins the getaway portion of our getaway weekend in the country. Hm. Hey, uh, what do you think of that house over there? It's for sale. You know, I think I like our condo in the city with the doorman who signs for our FedEx packages. I can sign for your packages. I mean, my penmanship is like, pssh, stellar. Okay, well, let's look at the house. - Really? - Yeah. You're clearly done taking pictures of your weird gross bugs. Let's do it. Yeah. Okay, all right. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. Um, is the house still for sale? Yes, it is, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm Meg. I'm Ralph. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Annie. - Hi. All right. Well, you guys are adorable. You wanna go check it out? - Sure. - Okay, let's go. So it's a four-bedroom, three-bath, built in 1970. And the previous owner, Mr. Logan actually disappeared about five years ago. There was no trace and no family behind, so nobody knew where he went. - That's weird. - Ah, you know, not so weird. Happens more than you think, you know, people are runnin' away from their lives. Anyways, uh, the house has actually been through all of its foreclosure abandonment proceedings. So the bank owns it now, and it's, they're ready to get it off their hands. Full disclosure, that was not technically on the market. And there is one buyer that's interested. And there's gonna be a few more that's gonna wanna look at it, so I would jump on this. Yeah, we just started looking, so... - Yeah. - Yeah. No, totally. But there's plenty of space here, you know? So when you wanna start a family, which... I mean, you guys already look like you're ready for that. Unlike me. Yeah, I haven't been able to find a husband or, you know, a good guy, which I need one of those. You know what I mean, Ralph? Am I right? - Okay, yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. Ooh, um, so would you mind, uh, showing us the, the rest of the house then? Let's, uh, let's go see the master suite. It's right this way. What's this, like, a closet? Oh, uh, no. That leads down to the basement, actually. - Oh, there's a basement? - There is. - Can I see it? - But... Ah, it's actually been abandoned so long, I'm not sure I have a key. Um, I do have an idea. Uh... Ho! Um... One of my many rare talents. Ta-da! Wow. Okay. So you guys are gonna see there is plenty of unfinished space here. So, honestly, uh, you can make it your own. - Do whatever. - Wow! This is huge! I mean... Are you kidding me? Huh. It's like a, it's like a new wall over here. It's like a recently refurbished situation. I mean, we could paint it. All right, I can see it. Dark room goes in there. Studio goes over there. - Oh. - Hm. Oh, you take photos. Yeah. Nature photography mostly. Trees and plants and gross insects, according to her. Okay, have you ever, uh, thought of taking realtors? I mean, gross or otherwise. Well, I don't do headshots, but if, you know, you help us out with the house, I-I would take all the photos of you that you wanted. Yeah, really? - Yeah, really. - Okay. Okay. - I'm gonna take you up on that. - Okay. All right, guys, let's, uh, let's go see the bedrooms. All right? So... Let's head up this way. Just be careful here. Okay, Meg. Needless to say, we love the house. - You do? Oh, that is great. - We do? You know what? I'll, um, I'll give you guys a moment. Yeah, we do. I-I, I can see it. I think this is our family home. You're serious. Okay, do you guys remember that other buyer I told you about that was interested? Well, that's her. Her parents own the pharmacy, and they left it all to her. Why is there a sign up, Meg? Hi, Lynette. I thought this was supposed to be an off-market sale. I don't think I officially agreed to that. Meg, I brought you on as a formality. Remember? I needed a broker and you needed a commission. So I, I don't understand why you're showing the house. Right, that was before I knew that you were gonna tear it down and build, you know, I don't know what. But the Savages actually really like the house as is, so I think that makes them the better potential buyer. Look, I'm, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this. I completely respect that you're trying to buy your dream home. So why don't we do this? We'll both put in our offers and we'll let the bank decide. Good luck. Buh-bye. I'm so sorry about that whole thing. We don't want a bidding war. You know what? Actually, don't even worry about her. I can take care of her. It's nothing. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Well, then, yeah, we are interested. - Yeah. - That's great. Oh, my gosh. Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - So we'll be in touch. - Okay. - Can't wait to hear from ya. - Bye. - Yeah, you bet. - All right. Buh-bye. You know how this works, Bob, my client gets full custody, yours gets visitation. Simple. - Hi. - Thank you. Yes, family is important. But you and I both know there's no such thing as a perfect family. So this is what we can offer you. Talk it over with your client and call me back. Okay. Bye, Bob. - Meg! - Hi. Okay, I just, I couldn't wait to tell you this in person. The bank approved you for the house. - Wait, really? - Yeah. What about the other buyer? Oh. Lynette Dee? No, I told you, she's a non-issue. The house is yours. - Oh, my God. This is amazing. - I know. I mean, Ralph is gonna be thrilled. But, Meg, you didn't have to come down here to tell me that. - You could've just called. - Are you crazy? Annie, th-this is your dream home. This, this is a huge moment for you and Ralph. No. Uh... This deserved much more than a phone call. You guys are my favorite couple. You always deserve my personal attention. Thank you so much, I really appreciate you coming down here and doing this. Yeah. Of course. If you, uh, need anything else, don't hesitate to call. - Okay? - Okay. - All right, bye. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. Honey, we got the house. Babe, you almost finished? Can't tell if this thing's straight. Be out in a sec. Hm. Up on the right a little bit. Yeah. Perfect. - Were you expecting someone? - No. - I come bearing gifts. - Oh. Hi, I just wanted to check in, see if you guys needed any help or... Oh, wow. - Oh, Annie, it looks so great. - Thank you. You really do have great taste. Hi, Ralph. Oh, that picture's crooked. Here, let me help you out. Let me, uh, just get it up on the right. Yeah, perfect. - Annie, is that you? - Yeah. - Long time ago. High school. - Ah, she's being modest. It's when she won the state championship in basketball for school. Oh, and it hangs proudly in our house. It's true. You guys are so cute. Anyway, so I want you to try these. So follow me. Okay? So come on. So, do you normally drop in on your clients to check up on them? No. No, thank God. No. Just you. You know, I'm kinda hoping that, uh, you know, what you guys have going on kinda rubs off on me. But first I have to find one of these guys. You know, a little sexy hubby right here. Am I right, Ralph? Annie, maybe I'll just steal this one from you. I'm just kidding. Anyways... So, Ralph, how's, uh, how's work been? Uh, I haven't been doing a lot of it lately because I've been getting the house ready. Um, I finished my dark room. Um, but thankfully, this one has a steady job. Yeah. It's nice to be a kept man, am I right? Well, I don't... I never really think of it like that. Ralph and I just have different careers is all. No, I know. I mean, his is, uh, nature and not stressed. And yours is, you know, fluorescent lights and high stress and evil nut-jobs and... Crazy. - Oh. - Oh. Uh, yeah, it's the rolling blackouts. The power company keeps implementing 'em more and more. It's, it's a thing. Well, how long does a rolling blackout last? It depends. I mean, sometimes it lasts longer than others, but... You know, actually, when I get back from the little girl's room, I bet it's back on. Uh, it's just down the hall. I know. I know where everything is. What are you two, a comedy act now? - What? - Lawyer jokes? It was, it was a, it was a joke. - It was a bad joke. - With the realtor. Who we don't know. She brought us treats. Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. Oh, God, this is so great. I knew this was gonna happen. I... You-you guys don't seem thrilled. Are you... I haven't had a chance to... You haven't told him yet. Oh, my God. Um... I am so sorry. Um... - I can't... - Is that a... - A, uh, the thing? - Yeah. I'm so sorry, you... I'm really sorry. Uh, you know... I know, honey. - For what it's worth... - Babe... Um, con... Congratulations. Hm... Yeah... Oh, I should check this. Oh, perfect timing. I made a brisket. Look, hon. Meg made us dinner! Yeah. Isn't that happening right now in our house? Okay, so I know you're probably wondering why is the realtor here again in your house. Okay. I just, I just felt so bad about the other night, you know, kind of, spilling the beans and, wrecking your moment and... Okay, well, I knew you were working, so I thought I'd surprise you... and make you dinner. And... Oh, and Meg brought us a gift. - Did she? - Mm-hmm. I did. Okay, I hope it's not too much. It's way too much. I had it mounted. Ah! Surprise! Well, I mean, I wanted to, you know, it's a big moment, so... - Commemorate it. - Wow. The stick I peed on is mounted. Thought I misplaced it, but, no, no, you took it, and there it is. - Well, thank you. - No, I know. It's, um, it's... I mean, it is, it's a tad weird to mount pregnancy tests. So I... It's kind of a gag gift. You know, I thought we could, I thought we could have a little laugh about it. Yeah. Anyway, I really want you guys to know how happy I am for you guys. - I really am. - Thanks. What? Are, are you mad? Don't, don't be mad. I... Wh-what was I supposed to say? Take the brisket and go? Um, yeah. That's exactly what you were supposed to say. But you didn't, instead, the two of you were just playing house in here. Oh, and the kicker? A mounted pregnancy test. Oh, I know. Hey, we can hang it in the bathroom. Oh, I'm-I'm just kidding. Even she said it was a gag gift. Look, I-I-I couldn't tell her to just leave. I mean, I think she's lonely. And she likes us. She's the realtor, Ralph, not your BFF. The realtor, who has access to all of our personal information, our finances, our lives. I mean, she knows this house better than we do. Oh, my God, you're right.. Oh, my God! You're right. I think she's a stone-cold killer. Oh, come on, Ralph, where's the level-headed man I married? Okay, you gotta admit there's something off about her. Yeah, there's something off about her. I mean, she shows up uninvited all the time. She brought that mounted pregnancy... We're throwing that thing out. Okay, so the level-headed man that you married thinks she's weird. And you know, now that she apologized and we're settled, I don't think we're gonna see her much anymore. - Okay? - Okay. Okay? Come here. - Hi. - Jeez! - I'm sorry. - Ah! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. You, you can't sneak up on people like that. What are you doin' out here? You just dropping by again? No! Um... Well, actually, I wanted to hire you. Do you need some photos of flowers? No. What? No. I, um, I-I wanted you to take some photos of, of me, actually. Ha! Don't do head shots, Meg. I know. But, I mean, you remember what you said, uh, the first time we met, right? When you said that if you guys got the house, then, you know, you'd take as many photos as I wanted. - Yeah. I did. I did. - You did. You did. - I said that. - You said that. Okay. All right, let's go. - Sure, come on. - Okay. You know, thanks for doing this, I'm actually really excited about it. Yeah. I told you I would. Uh, so you remember the basement. - Yeah. - I might put a pool table here. Um... But for now, there's the studio. Yeah, no, it's actually pretty impressive. You've got a lot going on here. Yeah, well, I'm a photographer. Um, is there any place I can change? Yeah. Uh, just the bathroom upstairs. Oh, okay. All right, I'll be quick. Okay. - I'll just get this all set up. - Okay. Exactly what I wanted to do today. Meg? Meg! Oh, man... Meg, you in there? Oh, sorry. Jeez. Meg, I'm, I'm sorry, I, about upstairs. I didn't, I didn't mean to, uh... Ralph, it's okay. It's my fault. I should've locked the door. Still that, that's embarrassing and I, I wasn't... Shh. It's fine. I'm sure I'm not the first naked woman that you've seen, right? Um... Um... Let's, uh, let's just get started. Uh, just, I'm gonna put you here. Okay. All right, this is just a, uh, just a light test. Right that way. Yeah. Well, kinda facing down a little bit. Yeah, okay. Can I, um... - Just need to... One sec. - Yeah. It's like just there. Looks good. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right. Uh, bring your chair over here and then, yeah, and then tilt your head this side. No. The other way, there we go. Little bit better. That's great. Great. Smile right there. What is that? Uh, it's the camera rewinding. - I shoot film, you know? - Oh. Oh. So I can't see any of it? No. I develop 'em in there, that... You remember the dark-room conversation? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Can I see it? The dark room. - Uh... - Please. I've never... I've always wanted to know how this whole thing works. All right, yeah. I can, I can show it to you. - Great. Okay, good. - Um... See, we make a good team. You had fun. - Yeah, yeah, I... - I could tell. I had fun, too. - Good. Good. - Mm-hmm. Um, just shut the door behind you. Sure. And then... before too long... image starts to develop. And there... Now it starts to develop an image. Oh. Look at that. Well, that's like magic. It's like magic. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's like magic. Whoa! - Oh. - I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry. - Um... Oh, my God. Oh, boy. - Uh... - Wait. You wanted me to do that. No. No, I didn't. Yeah. Why are you saying this? Ralph, in our session it was... I felt it, we were so connected. And it-it was intimate and I, I sensed you and I... - It was real. - I... I think you're, you're misunderstanding that. You know, sometimes when you're shooting, you need to be intimate as you said, with the subject to, to make them more comfortable. It's, it's just, it's just for the photos. But... Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid! - I can't believe I... - You're not stupid. It's... Don't know, I just... I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid! - I'm so tired... - Whoa, whoa. - I'm so stupid. - Okay, you know... Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Meg. Meg. Hey, come on, come on. Relax. Relax. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. Okay? Can you breathe? Okay? Breathe. I think, I think I should just, uh, mail you the photos. I, I gotta go. I... Hey, don't open the... Don't open the... Oh, great. Hi. How was your day? Oh, you know... Well, like that. You took pictures of her? Oh, I didn't want to. It was pretty weird. You were right. I don't want her coming around here anymore, like, at all. Hon... Hey, could you make a couple of copies of that affidavit and send it over to the court for me? - Mm. - Thanks. I'm just here to apologize. Can I please, can I talk to you? - No, you need to go, right now. - Please. Okay, Annie, look. I know you're mad, and I'm so, I'm so sorry. - I feel awful. - Do you? - I really do. - No, you don't. I wish we never bought that house from you. And if you don't get out of my office, I'm calling security. I know you don't wanna talk to me, I get that you don't wanna talk to me, but you have to understand. Yes, I was jealous of you for what you had. I have, I've never been loved in the way that Ralph loves you. And I think some messed up part of me just wanted to feel it or... I'm sorry. Will you please take these? I don't, I don't wanna lose your friendship. I don't want your flowers and you're not my friend. Now get out of my office. I don't know what else you want me to say! I didn't mean to come on to your husband, okay? I didn't mean to! I am not a home wrecker! - I was confused. - Can we get security please? - I lied to the bank for you. - What? The bank wanted to give Lynette the house because she owns Vexter Pharmacy. So, obviously, she is the more desirable buyer. But you know what I did? I pulled strings. I fixed the system so that you could get the house of your dreams, that's what I did! What kind of realtor are you? I've done all of this for you guys. And you don't even call me your friend? - I am not a bad person, Annie. - Ma'am, let's go, you're leav... Oh, wow, this is how you thank me. You're gonna sic your dogs on me? Let's go. Now. Okay. Fine! I'm leaving! You are making a huge mistake, Annie Savage. You have me all wrong! You are making a huge mistake, Annie. I'm going! Must be nice to inherit the family business. Hi, my name is Annie Savage. I'm calling Lynette Dee, please. Just a moment. Hello? Annie? Hi, Lynette. Thanks for taking my call. What can I do for you? Well, I am calling in the spirit of full disclosure about the house. Meg Atkins worked the bank over so you'd be approved instead of me. Yeah. That's right. How did you know that? Uh, when I didn't get the house, I dug. Meg is a piece of work. Strange one to be sure. But she was your realtor. A mistake, in hindsight. I was gonna make a deal with the bank directly, but she begged me to let her be the broker on that property. I felt bad for her, so I said yes. Long story. Anyway, that's what I get for trying to be nice. Look, I'm only telling you what happened with Meg because it's the right thing to do. Okay. Thanks for calling me and telling me the truth. Goodbye. Your ears must be burning. You-you think you can do me a favor? Can I get a few more of those painkillers? Shoulder acting up again? Obviously. That's why I'm calling you. You fought the cops so hard, they had to take you down on the ground. They ended up dislocating your shoulder? Um, yeah, it's, it's been popping in and out of socket, so... D'you think I can get just a few more? This'll do the trick. Meg? I know what you did with the bank. Annie told me. She-she called you? Just now. Why would you do that? Because... Because they reminded me of David and Rose. And you didn't even care about that house anyway. So why does it matter? That was my house, Meg. We had an arrangement. That was when we thought there weren't gonna be any other buyers. And then they turned out to be wonderful people. Despite, even if they have the wrong idea about me. Oh, Meg, don't do this. For your sake. You remember what happened. This is nothing like last time. Meg... Lynette, this is nothing like last time. I got better. You know I got better. Look, can I just, I'm just gonna swing by and get those pills today, okay? Thank you. Did you hear that? No. That I heard. What? - Do you see anything? - I don't see anything. Oh, my God, she's in the back. Don't open the door. I'll call 911. - I'll call 911. - Hey! So she didn't make any threats either. No, none of that, she was just standing outside of our window trespassing on our property. You're a lawyer, Mrs. Savage. So you know she can argue that she was about to knock and simply was just checking to see if anybody was home. Point is, she didn't technically break any laws. Yes, I am a lawyer and I'll bet I can find a law or two she's broken. All right, okay, okay, it's... Uh, we'll just call if she comes back, I guess. Yeah? Okay. All right, well, thank you for coming out. - And have a good night. - Goodnight. - I mean, he's doing his job. - Poorly. I mean, the least they could do is bring Meg in for questioning. You heard what he said. They can't even find her. Well, what else are they supposed to do? - Hey, just stay calm. - I am calm. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Oh, my God. Stay away from me! Oh, my God. Call security! I'm, uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Savage, but, uh, we didn't find her. Uh, she must've slipped out, but we're gonna keep looking. We'll find her. I'm leaving this house, okay? I don't care. We'll check in to a hotel until they find Meg. What? No, no, look. Hey. I know you're scared, but we're not checking in to a hotel. Then what are we gonna do, Ralph? We're gonna stay here? And wait for her to kill us both? No. Of course not. But... this is our house. I mean, we're gonna have our kid here. We stay. Defend it. How? We don't own a gun. We don't even have a baseball bat. What are you talking about? I got two guns. - Do you want me to get a gun? - No. I don't like guns. No, I don't like guns either. But we're not running and hiding in a hotel. Okay? This is our house. - We stay. - You're right. We should stay. All right. I'm scared. Yeah. You admit that she's a psychopath? I admit you're right. You're always right. If we die, it's your fault. We're not gonna die. Give me this. - Get in bed. - Ugh.. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. Oh, my God! 911. What's the nature of your emergency? Hi. We need the police. Yeah, there's someone outside our house. I think they're trying to break in. As soon as you can. Thanks. Bye. - Somebody's in the house. - Oh, my God. - Somebody's in the house. - Oh. We need, we need something. - Uh... - I don't know, what? Listen. I don't know, I don't know. Whoa! Hey, what are you doing here? Please, please, look, I was, I was just driving by your house, and I saw that someone was trying to break in. Yeah, right, she's trespassing. Ralph! - No, no, no, no. - Get out! Listen to me, listen to me. Okay, okay! There was someone, there was a, they had a gas mask on and I-I-I didn't, I didn't see their face, but I-I swear, this is, I'm not making this up, I swear! Okay, it sounds like BS. It's not. I've done so much... - Back off! Hey, back off! - I've done so much... You're never listening to me! No one is ever listening to me! Don't you understand? This is the same guy! This is the same guy that was here the other night when I was here, and I-I-I fought him and I threw him down the stairs. Don't you understand? - Tell it to the cops. - I'm not crazy! I am not crazy! So what-what, did you decide to break in to our house? I didn't break into your house. I was just trying to help you. I was... Yeah, I-I should have knocked. But I didn't know, I didn't know if anybody was in here and was trying to harm you. So you picked the locks and let yourself in? - Show me your hands! - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Is that the gas mask you said the prowler was wearing? Yes, I told you, I took it off of them! I... Annie, this is not mine. I swear to God, that is not mine! So it fell off the prowler as he ran away? Or maybe you simply dropped it here as you made your way into our house? Ma'am, that's enough. We'll take it from here. No, Annie, no. I would never do anything to hurt you. You're my friend! I was trying to protect you! You know I would never do anything! Annie, please, you have to believe me! Please! Whoa, wow. That is some story. I'm sorry you and your husband had to endure that. Thank you. That's actually the reason why I called you down here today. You said on the phone that maybe you could tell me her story. And seeing as we can't keep her in jail forever, I thought maybe it'd be good for me to know what to expect when she gets out. Makes sense. Where do I start? Okay. This isn't exactly the first time Meg has been obsessed with a couple. - No? - I'm afraid not. Several years back there was another couple. Same situation. Meg was their realtor. - And you knew this couple? - I did. After they bought the house, got the keys and moved in, Meg just kept showing up almost every day. Wouldn't leave them alone. - She wanted what they had. - Sound familiar? So what did this couple do about her? Hm, they got the police involved, filed restraining orders, et cetera. Meg wasn't allowed to get near them, and as a result, had a nervous breakdown. Yeah, the cops came and arrested her. She fought them. Even got her shoulder dislocated. It was insane. She went into an institution and everything. - Oh, my God! - Yeah. Yeah. Uh, to her credit, she got treatment. Meds, therapy. Came out a changed woman. Tsk. But was she really better? I don't know. This is awful to admit, but because of her checkered past, I figured I could use her to snatch up that house easily. Off-market. Well, I guess that's what I get for being greedy. Well, evidently, she wasn't as rehabilitated as they thought. Doesn't look that way, does it? I suppose it was only a matter of time before she snapped again. Yup, Jeffrey Dahmer was just a normal guy until the day he snapped. And then he ate a dude. Well... I would imagine that this whole nasty situation with the realtor has left you and your husband with bad taste in your mouths. About the house? I don't mean to sound callous, but I see a business opportunity here. It'd be understandable if after all of this the house has lost a bit of its, uh, sheen for you and Ralph. Nobody would fault you if you felt that way. And if you did, I could buy it off you two, off-market. Cash. Ten percent above what its worth. Take the house off your hands. Obviously, you're gonna wanna discuss it with your husband. Of course, but even without talking to him, I can assure you we love the house. And all this Meg stuff aside, we're really enjoying it. And even the commute to work, which was my big worry at first, is easy. And we really couldn't ask for a better home. I am happy to hear that. - Congratulations. - Thank you. And thank you for coming down here to shed some light on the realtor. Of course. Anytime. Close D-3. Hands. Oh... Sanchez. Atkins. I got those law books you requested. You really representing yourself? - Uh, those are mine, too. - Oh, yeah, right. Here. Public property records. Savage residence. Should we open it? It's from her. Yeah, I know it's from her. Should we open it? No, we don't know what's in it. It's not ticking, that's good. Ha-ha. Very funny. - Let's open it. - Yeah, open it. Whoa. "Dear Annie and Ralph," I've enclosed some pertinent information about the history of your house. "Please have a look and then come visit me to discuss." Oh, great. Perfect time for a rolling blackout. Old school? Candles? - Yeah. - Here we go. Wait, let me see... Annie. Oh, my God! Hi. So you got my package? Thanks, Patty. We'll just be a minute. So did you have to pull a lot of strings to get in here? I told them I was your lawyer. - Are you? - No. Why did you send me all of this, Meg? Well, I was trying to prove to you that there was actually someone outside your house. I'm, I'm innocent, Annie. Okay. Do you remember the previous owner, Mr. Logan, how I told you that he vanished? - I do. - Okay. Well... I started thinking about that. I mean, what's up with that? Why would he... Why would he just leave that beautiful home? - Yes, it is a great house. - Right. Okay. So when I started digging, it turns out that the previous owners... Also vanished. I told ya. Read it all. Exactly. Yes, okay, so you get this. So I, I think that they are connected. It does seem that way. Says here, "David and Rose Bernard were the original owners." And here it says that the Bernards had a daughter. Yeah, and when the daughter was 15, someone broke into their house, ended up kidnapping David and Rose, except for the daughter was in the closet hiding, and the kidnapper had no idea. And then they were never seen from again. Except, there was never any evidence of a break-in or a struggle. It was just the word of a scared teenager, who was then sent to live with family until she turned 18 and was awarded the family business. Okay. But can you guess who the teenager was? Well, according to the census report, her name was Lynette Dee Bernard. Seems to be the same Lynette we know. Name, age matches up and everything. Because it is the same Lynette. Annie, she grew up in that house. Uh, something bizarre took place in that house. But you knew. I knew, I knew what? You knew she grew up in that house. You've known the whole time, haven't you? Yes, okay, yeah, no, I knew, I knew she grew up in the house, but that's why I sent you all of this stuff. Here's the thing, Meg, after you sent me all of this, I did a little digging of my own. This is the real estate disclosure for the house back when the Bernards bought it. And if you look down here all the way at the bottom, you can see the name of the real-estate agent who brokered the sale. Meg Atkins. That's weird. That's your name, isn't it? And this is the real estate disclosure for Mr. Peter Logan, the second owner. It turns out, Meg Atkins was also his real-estate agent. What a coincidence. Okay. No, I get, I get how this looks. You... Okay, yes, I knew she lived in the house and I was the realtor on both of those, but it was because I specialize in foreclosure agreements. Annie, I sent you this so that you could see what happened in the house when Lynette was 15, to David and Rose. I... I know that that prowler that tried to get into your house is connected to the ones from the past. That's why I've done all this digging... Enough, Meg. Enough with the mysterious prowler crap. Okay? Just admit it. Admit what? Lynette already told me about the other couple you were obsessed with prior to Ralph and I. Okay, obviously, she didn't wanna say it was her parents because that's private and painful. So here's what happened. Okay, there was no prowler. You got out of rehab, you had some weepy mea culpa, proclaimed yourself a changed woman, and the Bernards let you back into their life. They were clearly kind-hearted people. They were kind-hearted people. I loved them. Yeah, I might have loved them a little, a little too much. And... I got better. But after they spent a little time with you, Meg, they realized maybe you weren't all that healed. No, that's where you're wrong, because I'm still better and they loved me. And you waited for a moment, you waited for the perfect moment when you thought Lynette wasn't home, and while she hid in the closet, you killed them. How... How could you say that I would do that? Because it's what happened, Meg, admit it! No! That is not what happened! I would never do that to them. I don't know what truly happened, Annie. I don't know, all I know is that, uh, they... All I know is that they vanished! - They vanished? - Yes! - Like Mr. Peter Logan? Okay. - Yes. The same Mr. Logan who bought the house for a special price because it was, you know, a quote, "Foreclosed abandoned property?" Then, thanks to some twisted, maniacal logic of yours, you decided Mr. Logan didn't deserve to be in that house anymore, didn't you? You decided that that house belonged to the daughter of your favorite couple, Lynette Dee Bernard. - Annie... - So you killed him. Just like you killed the Bernards. - Stop. - And the twist. The twist is, then Ralph and I come to town right before you get her into her childhood home. - Please stop. Stop it, please. - And a new obsession is born. Those bodies are gonna turn up, Meg, chock-full of your DNA. - And you'll be done. - I said stop! Annie, this visit is over. Just so you know, the DA is a good friend of mine, and the office isn't that far from here, so I think I'll take all of this down there and drop it on his desk. Annie, don't do that. I've been trying to protect you. Don't make the mistake. I'm telling you, Ralph, I felt great. I've never tried a murder case, but I have to imagine that that's what it feels like, you know, knowing you've got the goods on a sociopath, and she's going away for life. - Yeah? That's awesome. - I know. I'm glad it's over. Oh. She's here. So did she confess to all of this? No, but once she sees the case that's being built against her, she will. It's only a matter of time before we find out the truth about what happened to your parents. I don't, I don't know what to say. This means so much, thank you. Is that the cops? It looks like it. - I'll check. - Okay. All right. - It's Officer Miller. - Hm. Hey. Come on in. Mr. Savage. What's, uh, what's going on? Sorry to disturb you folks this evening, but I'm afraid I have bad news. Meg Atkins escaped from custody. - You're kidding. - I wish I was. I could go in further detail, but... She's on her way here. Yes. That's what we're afraid of. Which is why we have a black and white stationed outside, and I personally will be taking the first shift, okay? So rest assured, we have a city-wide search going on. She will be found. I want you to look out for my flashlight. If I flash it three times and wave, that means all is good. If I leave it and don't wave, that means stay inside. Meg Atkins shows up, I'll arrest her. - Thank you, officer. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Be careful. Goodnight. Oh, Lynette, we're so sorry. We bring you out here, and then all this happens. That's... It's not your fault. There's so much more to discuss, I... I wanted to explain why I didn't tell you I grew up in this house. Anyway, I guess we'll have to leave it for another time. There's no explanation necessary, but thank you. Thank you. Goodnight, guys. - Be careful, all right? - Yeah. Oh, my God. Come on. All right, that's it. Last one. Every window is locked, every door is locked, got a cop outside, she's not getting inside. I'm gonna make some tea. Do you want some? - Yeah, that's be nice. - What kind? Uh, something chill, like maybe chamomile or something. Oh, come on! Not now! - All right. - Maybe it's a... Maybe it's a quick one. Flashlight... Here we go... "Come on, hon, let's move to the woods. We won't have any neighbors for miles. It'll be great." Sound familiar? I may have said that. I wonder if the officer knows the power's out. 10-5. Hey, what's the status of our jailbreak? It's gonna be a long night. This has to be the last time. Maybe we should move. Probably squirrels. I mean, this is ridiculous. How many times is this gonna happen? It happens a lot. Did he see that? Does he know the power's out? No, probably not. I mean, he doesn't seem alarmed. No. Hey, but what if, what if it's not a rolling blackout? I mean, what if it's someone who knows where the main breaker is? N-no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Where's the... Where's that level-headed woman I married? Huh? Yeah, you're right. It's probably fine. - Come on. - Okay. We're good. He's there. What the... Show yourself! No! He's been out there a while. Maybe he needs to use the bathroom. We could offer him something to eat? Yeah, we should. Let's go. Be nice. - Whoa! - Ooh. Ooh, ooh... What happened? Whoo. I bet he's starving. I bet he wants hot chocolate. - Oh, yeah. - That's what I want. Yeah. Are you offering up my services for my hot chocolate? You have the best. Oh, is he asleep? - He better not be sleeping. - Mm. I don't know, looks like it. Hello... Oh, my God! Oh! - Oh, my... Was that blood? - He's got blood on his face. - Officer Miller? - Officer Miller? Officer Miller? Oh, my God! No, no, hold on, hold on, stay here, stay here. - Stay here. Okay. - Oh, God. Okay, we're gonna get in the car. We're gonna go, let's just get in the car. My keys are in the house. The door's wide open. She could be inside. All right, babe, I gotta go get the keys. I'm gonna get the keys, but you gotta stay here for me. - No, I'm coming with you. - No, baby. You're pregnant. Okay? That doesn't mean that you're not strong, badass. But you're pregnant, so for me, for all of us... you stay here, okay? - If I don't come back... - Ralph... Just no-no, listen to me, if I don't come back, you just run, you just gotta run. - Ralph... - Okay, no. Shh, listen to me. Can you do that for me? If anything happens to me, you just run? Okay? - Okay. - I love you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Be careful. - Annie, wait, come on... - Ralph! Ralph! Please. You can't go into that house. Oh, my God. Okay, wake up. Ralph, wake up! Wake up! Please don't do whatever you're planning on doing. I'm pregnant. No way am I gonna dig up this basement wearing this mask, am I right? Much better now. Oh, my God, Lynette? Wh-what... W-what'd you do to Ralph? He's fine. Passed out. Had to give him a few extra sprays, you know, being a man and all. Fentanyl. But in aerosol form. Potent stuff. The perks of inheriting the local pharmacy. Access to all the good... He'll live, I think. So help me understand what's happening. Well, Meg here was telling the truth. There really was a prowler outside your house. Surprise, that prowler was me. You? Mm-hmm. Me. I was gonna get in to your house that night, nice and quiet, when Meg showed up, went all Krav Maga on me. Meg was telling the truth? Hm. Yeah. She was never stalking you guys. I was. Yeah, Meg is, in fact, just a caring, pathetically lonely realtor. Hi, mom. Hi, dad. Together again, here at home... as a family. Oh, my God. Oh, mom, your hair looks so pretty today. Wow. Daddy, oh. David and Rose. Soon after I put them in there and the stucco and cement dried up, which takes way longer than I thought, I called the cops. But not before I had practiced the whole sob story. "Home invaders broke in. Took my parents. I'm all alone. Boo-hoo-hoo." Cops checked the house. Even down here. And nobody suspected a thing. I went to live with my aunt and uncle, played the grieving kid. Oh, God, you should have seen me. I was such a good actress. The house was locked up and soon went into foreclosure. Then I turned 18 and I got the trust fund. And as an unexpected bonus, my parents had, in the event of their untimely death, had left me the pharmacy. I mean, surely they thought they'd leave it to me someday. But not that day! But I didn't want the pharmacy. I wanted this house. And by the time I turned 18, it had been bought. Thanks to Meg here. You say you loved my parents, but didn't hesitate to sell their house. Yeah, I did! I was trying to find someone who was worthy of this house. And you know what, Mr. Logan was because he loved this house. Oh, I'm aware. Hi, Mr. Logan. You again? I told you that I'm not selling my house! Now get off my property. Now! He wouldn't sell itto me no matter what I offered. And I offered him a lot. Unfortunately for Mr. Logan, I had access to all the fentanyl I needed to knock him out cold. Made killing him a whole lot easier. Hello, Mr. Logan. And I know all about your knack for picking locks, dear. Hence, I used ropes. No handcuffs for you. You killed a police officer. And? Serves him right for keeping watch on your house. But this rolling blackout was a godsend, let me tell you. Gives me all the cover I need. To do what? To add you and Ralph to my ever expanding graveyard in the wall. This time I will buy the house. And I will build a whole new one right over it. Nobody will ever know you and Ralph are in the wall. As for you, it's gonna look like you killed that cop in cold blood. You are an escaped convict, after all. But before he died, he managed to heroically shoot you. You died on the street next to his car. Oh, you're gonna have a gunshot wound in your chest when you're found. You're nuts. All right. Damn it! Dry. You won't get off that easy. I have a spare in my car. Don't go anywhere. Meg. Meg, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. - I wish I would've known... - It doesn't matter now, Annie. We gotta get out of here before she gets back here. But how are we gonna do that? Can you get out of your ropes? I'm gonna have to dislocate my shoulder. - Wait, what? - It's fine. It's, it's already messed up. It's gonna feel great. - Hold on. - Oh, my God. Oh... Okay. Come on! I'm coming. Okay. - Are you all right? - Okay. - Try to, to pull. Pull! - Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh... We can't go. She's upstairs. We can't go anywhere. All right, what do we do? What are we gonna do? I have an idea. Okay, this is what I'm gonna do. Uh... Undo the lanterns. Turn off the lanterns. Hm. I didn't think you guys would be able to get free. I'm impressed. Nice touch turning off the lanterns. Well, I wasn't planning on using the police officer's gun. Blood and bullet holes are hard to clean up. But not impossible. Where are you... Oh? The rolling blackout's over. Hello, Annie. Oh? And I get a baby as a bonus, too. Thanks, Meg. Yeah. Ralph. Ralph? Oh, my God, Ralph. Room left, clear. Hallway right, clear. I got eyes on target! Hands! Let me see your hands up, now! Ricky, cuff her. Easy, easy. She has a dislocated shoulder. No, guys. Hey, hey, she's innocent. She helped save our lives. Meg, they're gonna take you back to prison, but just hang in there. I'll get you out as soon as possible. - Okay? - Okay, who are you? I'm her lawyer. All right, bring her out this way. We should go. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney and to have her present with you during question... We're selling this house. Hello? Anybody home? Uh, yeah, I'm in the kitchen. Please come in. - Um, hi... - Hi. Hi, I'm here for the open house. Oh, right. Um, well, please look around. - Um, yeah, it's beautiful. - It is, it is, yeah. I-I really, uh, I love this home. The people that used to live here were really good friends of mine and they just, you know, decided to move on with their life. Um, but they did ask that I find a buyer that loves the house as much as they do. Yeah? Well, I can see why they love it. - Yeah. - Hm. So, uh, do you and your wife have children? Uh, no wife, no children. Figured I'd buy me a house first. Maybe I, maybe I'll find a wife later. - That's an idea. - Well... Um, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Um, Adam. - I'm Meg. - Yeah. - Hi. Uh, hi.
