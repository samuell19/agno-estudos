Hi. Dad, where do these tickets come from? Are they from God? No, from the machine. How did it get into the machine? The person in charge must have put it there. Where did the tickets come from? - From paper. From where do we get paper? - From the trees. Where do trees come from? - From God. So, these tickets do come from God. You're right! Shall we read God's message to you. Okay. Good fortune is round the corner. 'This is where it all started' 'the fairy tale of Sweety and the messages from the machine' 'That's when her inseparable bond with that' 'fortune-telling weighing machine began' 'Happiest girls only are beautiful girls.' 'Only when we share our happiness with others' 'it is truly meaningful.' 'With small smiles, we can win anything.' Sweety. 'Our loved ones never leave us. They're always with us.' Hi. Happy birthday, Fatty. 'Attention passengers. Train number' Swamy, Swamy. 'Be like you are.' 'That is beauty and happiness.' Hey. How long will you take? - Madam. Fasten the zip. Pull it. Idiot, are you fastening the zip or undoing it? Pull it up. Pull it up. - I am, brother. Pull it inside. We measured your size less than a week back and you've already gained one kilo. What do you do in the gym? I'm sure even the treadmill has worn out taking your weight. But I don't see any change in you. My weight is not the problem. It's the dress stitching. You've learnt to give smart answers. All your friends are happily married. and have their children clinging to them. But you are all grown-up and still clinging on to me. I am not fat, mom. I am full of health. Do you think only skinny women get married? I am sure my Prince Charming will come for me. More importantly, I am happy the way I am. Happy, happy. Do you think just being happy will fetch you a good husband? In what sense is our Sweety less, madam? Don't worry, madam. Sweety will get a good NRI husband (NON-RESIDENT INDIAN). Yeah, will come. She doesn't stand a chance, if she wears the ill-fitting clothes you've made. Zip up your mouth and try fastening the zip on her dress. Okay, madam. - Come. Hold it. - Okay, brother. Mom, do you think a smaller dress will make me look a size smaller? It was 'Diwali' to get out of the dress you made for 'Dussera'. Tuck your tummy in and hold your breath. A little more. Just a little more. God, help us! Don't you know what to say in front of other people? You embarrass me. How can I be blamed for his shoddy work? Stop talking. Take out the vehicle. - That's your phone ringing. Your brother, that monkey, irritates me by messing with my phone. Hello. It's Dabbaware, Rajeshwari, IAS. Tell me. The small one is Rs.100 and the big one Rs 150. A discount? I can't give a discount every other day. There will be plenty of offers during the festival season. Yeah. Thank you very much. What is 'IAS'? Independent Agent Sales. Dabbaware. This is also IAS. God save you! Move! I don't have enough space. If you take the whole seat, where will I sit? Amba. Stop, stop. Greetings to you, revered one. How are you Rajeshwari? What about your daughter's marriage? That's my only worry in life. I know. I just spoke to the planets about Sweety's birth chart. What did they say? Oh. Mars is in a very inauspicious position in her birth chart. If she doesn't get married this year, she never will. She will remain a spinster. Is there any remedy for this? Find a black cow with a white birthmark or a white one with a black birthmark and worship it for six weeks. Where can I find such a cow? Where can I find one that has birthmarks? How do you expect answers without doing the work? Do one thing. Why don't you take my place? I will look around and fetch a cow for you. No I am not talking anything. After six weeks of this ritual, surrender yourself at my feet. Okay, Swamy. - Then I will tell you. After six weeks, you can swindle us and take the cow away. Don't talk nonsense. Please pardon me, Swamy. She speaks out of ignorance. Good. If you had a girl, you could have got her married. But she is an inflated tube. Throw her into the pool. She will never get married. Go, pray to the cow. Salute him. Is it so hard to pay respects to me? Don't you want to get married? Please forgive her. Go. - Okay swami. I've told you to cover your face while going out. You will tan. Remember? If you don't get married this year, you will die a virgin. If your worry is about me dying a virgin I've plenty of solutions for that. You wretched girl! Is this how you talk to your mom? Your job is to ensure she exercises. I'll monitor that. Meanwhile, can you ask the Saint about a way to lose my virginity? Wait till you can be called an adult. See what I do when you come back. Would you like to eat now? After the month's expenses, we have Rs 20,453 in hand. If we have to run the house smoothly we have to sell a few things kept in the storage room. Let's eat. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Only your face is getting a workout how about moving the rest of your body. Will you shake your hip? Will it work out. Down. Up. Down. Up. Hey baby. Idiot. - Thank you. Hey, Yahoo. - Greetings. I haven't seen you at the gym for a while. I did a detailed research on inner wear. Did you find something new? I have plenty of new ideas. Take a seat. Take a look at this Sensual and roomy but expensive. Is that all? Don't you have other styles? I have international brands. It is not made of fabric but is of a special material. Do you like it? I can find this even in the local market. Can't you show something more exciting? How can I show you exciting stuff? My friend bought something interesting from Thailand. It has lights on them. Won't you get an electrical shock? Rubbish! The lights gave her a double bonanza! She has twins now. The shock would have killed the husband instantly. God! You're bigger than this bed. Who is exercising here? Is it you or her? Scumbag! If you dare tell mom about this. I'll tell her about your inner wear business. Don't call it the inner wear business. Make it sound sophisticated. Call it the 'soft wear' business. Are you in the software business? It's the 'soft wear' business. Do you want to buy? Idiot, get out. Go out and do your business somewhere else. Some evil spirits are pulling be back. You finish your business. We will discuss about it later. You continue the massage. ''Size Zero' is stirring up a storm in the city.' 'The Head of the company, Sathyanand' 'who runs Dubai's new and successful weight loss program' 'has his eyes set on the Indian market.' 'The 'Size Zero' promotional video has the young' 'and the old dancing to its tunes.' 'Within an hour of release on YouTube' 'it has been viewed 1 million times.' 'That video for you.' We've closed admissions now Come back for the next batch. Check this out Rs 200,000 to reduce 20 kilos. It's a huge waste. I wouldn't need that kind of money even to gain weight. We'll lose money, but won't lose any weight. Stop it. Say you don't want to exert yourself Don't blame it on the high costs. The groom's family is expected anytime. Hurry up. Where the hell is this boy? Don't get tense. Let's grab the bridegroom this time. The groom who comes now catch him like a hen under the basket. Why are you trying to grab the 'laddu'? You have Diabetes. You should be all right till the wedding. That's it. Let us take another one. You've been chatting. Why haven't you gone to the beauty parlour? Don't worry, aunt! We'll go to the parlour and get back in no time. Why should you come back? You head back to your house. Poor mom, she feels the groom might like you instead of me. Am I right, mom? - Yes, dear. I wish you exercise as much as you speak. You could lose weight. Like the price of gold, your weight increases by the day. If I've to buy you a gold waist chain I might have to sell the house. Get ready. So, this is a tube top. I am expecting the groom's family any moment. Have you fixed the flush in the toilet? Don't worry, I will fix it. Why are you sulking? I sweep, mop, clean bathrooms and do all the chores. She might lose weight if she does some of it. You pay no heed to what I say. He isn't used to spicy food He will get used to it. My brother and sister-in-law couldn't make it here. Since Abhi is here on work, Neeraja is looking for a bride for him. I don't think that monkey fixed the flush. Let him get back home I will put him in his place. There she is, your future daughter-in-law. Take it. She looks beautiful despite being fat. This orange saree makes her look fat. Haven't I told you not to wear this saree? How many times should I tell you not to use orange? Sweety is the one adding beauty to the colour she wears. The flush doesn't work, Abhi Use a mug of water. Never did this happen. It's under repair. Not that she is my daughter, but... Sweety is very talented. Son. She works as a manager in an international hotel nearby. 'My mom will lie through her teeth to get me married' 'But some of it will be true' I started my career at a five-star hotel. However, in five months, the stars fell one by one I now work at a one-star restaurant nearby. You get the best drumstick chicken in the city at Chungking Express I've told her to stop working after marriage. Haven't I? Don't worry about cooking. When Sweety makes pasta for breakfast you can relish it the whole day. Only we've been talking. Why don't we allow the two of them to talk? Sorry for that. That's right Go, talk to each other. - You go. They are a match made in heaven. I see a bright future for Sweety. India is lot of power cuts, right? My weight made me uncomfortable and alone. 'Nobody talked to me. I was very sad.' 'We can gain many packs without going to gym. 'Presenting a magic belt that gives results in a week' Results in a week? Is that a grinder or a belt? I should try this sometime. Actually, this is not about you. I didn't mean you. I don't think you need that. That's for obese people. - Look here. I don't have an hourglass figure. I don't know how to cook. When I'm bored I smoke in the loo. When I don't feel good, I have a drink on the terrace. Forget making an exotic pasta, I can't cook an everyday meal. My blouse is three sizes smaller and might give way anytime. I will come to the point I am not interested in marriage right now. What should we do? Neither am I interested in getting married now I am here because my parents insisted. Actually I am a documentary film maker. Super. So, you don't have a steady income No wonder my weight wasn't a concern. You were probably counting on a dowry that's as big as me. Sorry, your movie is a flop. I don't make movies I make documentaries. You can check Youtube if you want. I don't trust the movie guys much. I have no interest in your videos. Our family is waiting anxiously for our announcement. That's more important. So, what do we do now? Let's tell them that neither of us is interested in this. Okay! I will tell them. Wait! I've never had the experience of rejecting anyone. So, let me tell them. I am not interested in this marriage. This is so unfair. What did I ask for? How long should I suffer like this? My husband left me with two useless kids and some worthless things. The way things are heading, my daughter will also become worthless. Why did you do this? Tell me. He's not some Superhero, he's a Saint. Get lost, you monkey! I wasn't talking about you, God! I have to get an NRI groom in three months. Believe in Happy Endings. Good morning, madam. - Hi. Hi, baby doll! What happened yesterday? It's gone. I even forgot about it. I said 'no' to the groom. - Really! Why? Was he a bore? Was he bald? Did he wear flower shirt or did he show arrogance? Hey, did he try to touch you? No. - Then? Just like that. What happened? Tell me. Why aren't you saying anything? There is something different about you. Have you lost weight? Or is something wrong with my eyesight? 'Size Zero' clinic does wonders. Why don't you join it and lose weight? Chungking Express. How may I help you? Chef 1 'schezwan noodles with chicken'. Okay. He is a regular here He's lost his job. We'll cheer him up with a fortune cookie. How may I help you? One Haka noodles. One drumstick and one cheese burger. He has to be given Kumfu treatment. Oh is it? Hi Uncle. - Hi Abhi. Hi. - Greetings. How are you? Yes. When will you do? - I am ready. He has to decide. - Brother. Hi! I said 'no' to you. Why are you following me? Aunt Neeraja is our friend too. Don't you remember? She introduced us to each other. I was just kidding Don't you get it? I am on a diet I don't eat carbohydrates. These aren't carbohydrates They're minced meat patties. They taste yummy Take one. I am a vegetarian I only eat salads. You know? Keep it simple! Sweets? No way! Do you have Diabetes? Shall I get you tablets from my grandpa? I don't have Diabetes. Eating oily food reduces your life span. Fat accumulates in the body leading to reduced metabolism and. Really? This is just the information you need. If you follow this diet, you can easily lose 10 to 15 kilos I am taking these for my mom. These are not for me. Some people look beautiful even if they eat minced meat patties. She is cute! Aunty, you are the one who should be on a diet. Abhi, stop kidding. How is your work in films? I don't make films, I do documentaries. Just starting. I am making one on toilets. Hygiene is very important. A documentary on toilets! I knew something was fishy when you took that long in the toilet. Something is wrong! Your brother volunteered to help. Is he? Don't trust him. He will leave you stranded. Abhi. I'll see you soon. What a beautiful view! Thanks! I know I look beautiful from this angle. Is that a soft drink? - Do you want a sip? No, thanks! It is late. I have to leave I came by to say goodbye. Will your mom ground you if you are late? No, I jog at the park at 6 in the morning. That early? Actually even earlier, I go at 5 am. I wake up at 4 am too. I wake up at 4 am even if I go to bed at 3. I hate to wake up late in the mornings. Even if I skip jogging a single day, my body and joints ache. Do you jog too? What a question? Sit down. As a child, I've jogged at every park except the one you go to. Why don't you come there tomorrow? Let us jog together. Is it a date? Are you okay? Wait! Let me see. 'The time was 9.56 24 seconds' 'When my grandpa stole his favourite 'laddu' 'That moment when Jyothi sprayed' 'her favourite perfume for the tenth time' 'That moment when my mom cribs to my dad' 'That was the moment I heard my own heart beat' See you at 5 o clock! Jack and Jill. Life is thrill. Hey, what is this? You sit like a polar bear in black paint. Hey, you don't know how to act. Why do you do over action? But, this face pack makes you look tolerable. Move, fatso! I have to use my laptop for work. I have so much of work, baby. Are you trying to hide it from me? Show it to me. You're tossing a coin for a match that has been cancelled. The game's over. Close your mouth. Saliva is flowing down. Idiot. - Don't beat me. Stop. Mom. Look here. Slowcoaches, make way. Are you out of fuel? Get lost! What happened? I thought I would lose weight, but it looks like I'll lose my life. Jogging doesn't mean running fast. Then? Does jogging mean nudging forward like a snail? No, jogging is an art. Your breath should neither be too fast nor too slow. You have to maintain the right level. If you overdo it at one shot, you'll be gone. Statistics show that 90 per cent of heart diseases are due to poor exercising. So, if you maintain your breath levels and run. Please stop boring me! I don't even have the energy to run away from you. You continue jogging. All right, wait for me to finish 10 more rounds. Ten rounds? My daughter-in-law doesn't agree if I don't eat atleast one sweet a day. You are very lucky. Grandpa. Go ahead and eat. I won't tell mom. If you give me one of that. You don't tell mom either I will. If you don't take another of this. Just two more. Take a good look. Do I look chubby or have I lost weight? You've lost 10 grams on your arms and 10 kilos from your head. Stop obsessing over this. You look just fine. - Not enough. The co-ordinator says I need to lose 10 more kilos. You'll look like a bag of bones if you lose 10 kilos. Michael. - Madam. Where do you have to deliver that? - Road number, 10, Ravikanth house. Very good. Why are you crazy about fortune cookies? I am not crazy I do it just for kicks. Hurry up. Why do you call me at this time? The line to use the toilet is longer than that waiting to watch new movies. We are just idling time, why not take a selfie? If we upload in Facebook, we will get a lot of likes. Hey. Super. Don't feel tensed. Feel happy. Take, take. Ready, bro. Ready. Everyone's been talking about the 'Clean India' campaign. What do you feel about having 1 toilet for every 10 houses? Is it not tough? I feel very good. While one guy goes in to do his business we spend our time having fun with friends. Isn't that awesome? Why are you getting so excited about using the toilet? Lower it down. One minute. Don't you get it? I want the right emotions. Ready! Come on! What do you feel about having 1 toilet for every 10 houses? When you are in a hurry to use the toilet someone will be singing inside. You will beg him to come out. Is this good? Superb! Did you tell him we're shooting a sitcom? You can't call this overacting. This is reality. We'll shoot the rest tomorrow. We're done for the day. Pack up? Bro. What are you doing here? My brother told me you were shooting here. Okay. - I thought of dropping by. This is my friend, Jyothi. - Hi. She's getting ready for the 'Miss India' pageant. Why don't you give her a chance to act in your film? I don't direct films. I do documentary. Forget it. I'll back in 5 minutes, okay? How could you reject such a handsome guy? He looks handsome, but he's quite a bore. The access to toilets is your birthright. It's been 60 years since Independence. But this basic facility is yet to reach the common man. Okay, okay. - Need sound. Yeah. - Mr. NRI. People are fed up of such promises. Those who have shot films in slums have turned millionaires. But people living here still lead a dog's life I am not like the rest of them. My efforts may or may not change others. But it does bring a change in me. I was one of those who would only tweet about problems. Today I am standing here. The change started with me. I will keep trying until it comes to you. This is my journey. These days many engage in social work to gain publicity. But you do a lot of genuine work even off the camera. Not bad! I'm impressed. In my own way, I do a few things you can term as social service. Nice! What kind of service? Do you want to see it? - Yes! Come on. Let's take my 'Benz' Okay. - What about me? Didn't you say you want to visit your grandma? Get going. I'll see you in the evening. What a liar! It's been 10 years since my grandma died. Sorry! Bad road! - That's ok! Come. So many posters! Is this a restaurant or a movie theatre? My boss is crazy about Chinese films. Hi, mam! - Hi. To say I love you for 40 days a month.. ..is not possible for me. You don't remember even my birthday. - Come on. Is it that I don't love you, if I forget it? You'll remember if you love me. - Now, watch it. May be you'll ask, who am I, at the time of marriage. See, you're making this an issue. Who started it? Was it me or you? You always say that I am wrong. Mada, bill. 'There is more than one way to show love.' Sorry! I'm very sorry! Social service! Sorry. - It's okay. If you have any problem, I'll set it right with a cookie. It's amazing. How did you come up with the fortune cookie idea? Logic can only take you from 'A' to 'Z' But imagination has no limits. This was my dad's little secret. That's nice! Your order, madam! Thanks! - Thank you! No! It's 8 pm. I don't eat carbs now. I know. These are not carbs. This is 'Paneer Butter Masala'. Have it. Hi Simran! Okay, I'll be there. See you, bye! Sorry! I need to attend an important meeting now. An official meeting after 8 pm. It's a meeting with an NGO. I am meeting a girl called Simran for my documentary. She works in our NGO. See you! At least, taste it. It's delicious. Why won't it be? It's floating in butter. Some other time. As a policy, I don't eat carbs after 8 pm. See you later. Bye! Before 8 pm. I wonder if he breathes after 8 pm! It is past 8 pm. Don't do this, don't do that! Wonder what he does after 8 pm? What about after the wedding? Won't he do anything after 8 pm? He is good, right? - Eat it. You take sweet. He is very good. So the bride is here. - Come on. Sit down. - Hey, what is it? One should never delay marriage. We will do it immediately. Next month is engagement for you. Foreign groom for you. What a heavy catch! Heavier than you, see it yourself. See yourself. What are all of you doing? Open your mouth. My dearest. The Saint has blessed you. The groom is from the UK and has a very successful business. He fell for you after seeing your photo on the matrimonial website. Just now they called me to inform about the engagement. Who put up my picture on the website? What if who kept it? He is the only son. Finally, your Prince came down from the internet. God bless that internet. Oh. Open your mouth. Grandpa, I am telling you this again. I will never marry that jackass from abroad. Even if you want it to happen, it won't. How is that? I have faith in you. He will reject the proposal himself. Stop pulling my leg, grandpa. I'll stop if you stop frowning. Come on, smile. Take this. Hi! - Hi! Are you done with your important work? Which one? The NGO meeting. It went off well Simran was very helpful. Simran! Even the sound of her name has a 'run' in it. I am sure you got along well. We did. We have a lot in common. She is a fitness freak too. We are just talking about her and there she is. Hi! - Hi Abhi! Sweety, meet Simran! Hi! Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you too! All right, Abhi. I'll leave. Hectic day. I have a lot of work to do for Keerthi's wedding. I need to shop too. - Okay! I was telling Simran. I was telling her it would be good if she came to Keerthi's wedding. She is feeling awkward. Why don't you invite her? I don't know anyone there. I won't feel comfortable. She's right. Why? I'll be there. Sweety will be there. You're coming, that's it! But, I'll be busy. Come on, Simran! Okay, I'll come! But I don't have the right clothes for the occasion. Sweety is going shopping. We'll join her. Simple. Oh really! Simran has joined hands with an NGO for cleaning up slums. She is keen on working with me on my documentary. She's organised a toilet-cleaning campaign in the slums next week. 'Good looks like Aishwarya Rai and a heart like Mother Teresa' Hope she dies of Ebola'. She's come down from London just for this. You've come all the way just to clean toilets! Don't you have toilets to clean there? Good one! Let's go shopping in the afternoon. See you there. Come, Simran. - See you. What music are you listening to? Justin Beiber. New album. Haven't you heard it? - No. Why do babes like her get visas to come here? Tell me the truth. There can be only two reasons to come here from the UK. You either lost your job or lost in love. Don't mean cheap! Doesn't anyone ever come here to do social service? Actually, I like it a lot here. I'm still looking for my place here. I too had a choice. A choice after MBA, between a well paid job and making documentaries or cleaning toilets. My parents didn't approve of my choice. They stopped talking to me. Only those who care about you will get mad at you. My parents have never been mad at me. I believe you will discover yourself in this journey. Oh really! How would you know? Because I'll be there with you. Abhi, just tie this one. - Yeah. Wow! Gorgeous! Next one! - Yes! Okay! Did you check on her? I've heard that most girls who come from foreign countries to join NGOs here are imposters. I didn't mean Simran. That is the general view. She is as pure as gold. This is the latest style. Very nice! This doesn't fit me well Do you have an 'extra small'? Shall I give you an 'extra large'? Extra large! Give that to your wife. I wear the 'extra small' in the 'medium' fit. This is a 'medium'. Then this must be my size. Let me try it. Madam, if you wear it, it will tear off. Try the high-waist style It will complement your figure. You look very big size on too. Oh really! 'Who the hell is she to give me fashion tips?' 'She looks like a clown in this outfit' Thanks! I'll try. Sweety, what is taking you so long? Are you trying the dress or making a new one? Stop it, Abhi. - Just kidding. Pack it! How will this fit her? Let's go. I am going on a tour with Simran. She is roping in several NGOs to support my 'Clean India' campaign. Abhi's, 'Clean India' campaign is very exciting. I've come up with a slogan for it. 'Clean the toilet and stay away from doctor.' That's a good one! Is it? - Yes. Clean toilet. Looks like you will clean all the toilets in India by yourself. India is blessed to have you. I'll see you later. Bye! Let me hold it. - Okay. Attention passengers. The train from Vikarabad to Guntur, super fast express.. ..in a short time.. 'Your lover is yours'. Hey, careful. 'That was the first time my heart soared with the winds' 'That was the moment Dolly kissed Chinnu's cheek for an ice cream' 'That moment when the boys yearned to get the attention of the girls' 'That moment when the bride blushed because the groom got playful' 'The machine's message was coming true I knew' 'my Prince Charming has arrived'. How could you mess up your sister's wedding? The family in London liked Sweety after seeing her photo. But they didn't see Sweety's original photo. It's duplicate. That photo was a touched up one. Take a look at this. He's edited the photos and made Sweety look slim. If the groom's family gets to know this, we'll die of shame. Don't worry. God will help us. Not God. I have to do something. Come what may, we shouldn't let go of this groom. I am definitely sending her to the 'Size Zero' gym from tomorrow. We have to ask Sweety if she is all right with this idea? This is about my daughter's marriage. I don't have to consider anyone's opinion. I am not willing to listen to anyone. Sweety has to go to 'Size Zero' gym and that's final. This is the only way to make this wedding happen. I don't care about what others think. Mom is right, grandpa. I can't be a burden to her any longer. No Prince Charming is going to come for me. I don't think I can get married without losing weight. I will join 'Size Zero', grandpa. I will marry the person you choose for me. Did you actually lose 4kgs in a month? Unbelievable. Yeah. No exercises. - Wow. Hi! - Hi! Welcome to size zero. - Welcome! New admission? - Yes! Okay! Please fill this form! Take a look at this. Is there an option for losing weight quickly? Yeah, we do have mam. Can we pay the fee in installments? Why do you say that? These days, people pay in installments for everything, including Dowry. Just to make sure our money is safe... Mahatma Gandhi said, 'Trust is where it all begins Trust is everything'. If you didn't trust us, would you have come here? You've answered it yourself. Well! I am 'Size Zero' Sathyanand. Hello, sir. - Hello! I am wondering if this is risky... There is a very big risk. - Oh, God! In the blink of an eye, your daughter will turn as pretty as a flower. Isn't that a risk? There'll be a stampede when men compete to marry her. Isn't that a risk? When this dear girl walks on the road boys will follow you trying to win the mother-in-law's heart. - Oh, God! This is my daughter, Soundarya. We'll finalise the wedding in a month. Okay. - The groom is an NRI. Nice. - She is plump now. I'd like her to become slim. Is it possible? 'When you have a determined mind' 'you can melt mountains', said Poet Sri Sri. Silky! - Sir. Enroll this dear girl in the 'Express weight loss' program. Okay sir! Can I get a discount? - Rajaswari madam! You can eat what you want, you don't have to exercise and yet you will lose weight. God can't do this for you, but I can. Please don't talk about discounts. - Not that, Sir. Rs.25,000 is all I have now. I'll give you the rest in a day or two. No! No, problem. Though advance money is not much but I see how much you love your daughter. This will do for now. One minute! It's Goddess Lakshmi, right? - Yes. Show respect. Miss Soundarya, please come. Let me introduce you to your personal trainer. This way, please. Come. When this vibrates on our waist it will melt our fat and make it disappear. - This way please. Is this nice? Bobby! - Hello, sir! This is your personal trainer, Bobby. It's a little difficult to believe, but his success rate is 100%. One minute, Sir. - Off the machine. Where is it from? Turn it off, sir... - Bobby! Turn it off, Sir. - Turn it off. Come, come. Nothing! This has been imported from London, but was made in China. He has trouble because the instructions are in a foreign language. Hello madam. Greetings. My name is Bobby, butterwala. I will melt the fat in your body, just like butter, easily. She is not the one who wants to lose weight It's her daughter. - Oh, is it her? He's always funny. - Yeah. Come let me show the spa. - Hello! Greetings! Hey, what are you doing? I need to reduce it, not here. - Yes. Here. - Where? You have a 'water-bag' for a stomach. Even 10 of these machines can't help you lose weight. Disgusting. Where is your jilebi? She didn't turn up. Where are your volunteers? It's India-Pakistan match. Even if Tsunami comes today, nobody will come out. Now, two NRIs should come together and clean the whole street. Very nice. We are a part of 'Clean India' campaign. We are here to clean your street. So we request you all to co-operate us. What do we do now? - You need volunteers. Right? What are you doing? Come inside. - Wait. Hey girl. Can I help you? Thank you. Are these volunteers enough? Or, do you need more of them? No, no. Good enough. Come on, take. Not just ads, a girl glamour is required even for social service. What are you doing here, pumpkin? I've joined the program. Joined? When? Which package? Express! Good! She is my friend. This week, I'll be talking to you about the equipment. Follow me. - Okay. This machine is imported from Indonesia. It's called 'Tickle-Ticklo-Tickle'. This machine will tickle you and burn your fat. Size zero magic protein shake! Drink a glass of this and your fat will disappear. Put this to your mouth. Sweety! What are you doing here? Have you gone mad? Why 'Size Zero'? Do you know anything about this instant weight loss program? I know nothing about instant weight loss. I just know that nobody likes me the way I am. The only man who liked me, said yes because he saw a photo-shopped picture of mine. You could have spoken to me about it. Why do you go missing all of a sudden? Won't you share this with me, like a friend? Abhi, I don't want friends. You asked me why I joined 'Size Zero'. I am fed up. I am fed up of being just a friend all the time. Hey. Hey, Jyothi! - Jyothi... Jyothi! - Jyothi... Jyothi... Hey! Sorry sir. You do that to save people from dying, not to kill them. What's happened to Jyothi? - I've told you several times. A weight loss program will de-hydrate your body. You need to drink a lot of water. I think she is alright. Yes. She must have felt giddy. Take her to the hospital. Okay. - All of you please listen. Please drink lots and lots of water. The beauty contest is in a week. Will I be discharged by then? The beauty contest is not important. Your health is more important. You'll be out soon and we'll feast on Chicken Biriyani after that. Okay? The 'fat-burning' shake is to be blamed. In order to bring about instant weight loss, the people of that clinic are using a lot of illegal drugs. It has a direct impact on the kidney. How long has your daughter been using these? Three months. This generation wants instant solutions. That's the problem. Find a husband in an instant, buy a car on the first job. A divorce within the weekend, weight loss in a week. One of her kidneys has failed. She needs a surgery as soon as possible. 'Fat burners' aggravate the situation for some people. Hope, she is lucky. That fat burners... - Excuse me! What's happening here? what's happening? Sweety has something to... Can I help you? Jyothi is critical because of the illegal 'fat burners' you gave us. Doctors insist on surgery. Please don't spread rumours. Don't spread just rumours. This is not such place. You know, this is an internationally certified clinic. To hell with your certification! Your advertisements claim you can lose weight within a few days. Add a 'conditions apply' clause to it. Say, not just weight, you will also lose your kidneys and liver as well. 'Being born as a person in this world is fortunate' said Poet Krishnamurthy. But I say, even a fat person is fortunate enough to have a second chance. But doctors say he is responsible for Jyothi's critical condition. You've got to bear Jyothi's hospital expenses. Cat is out of the bag. Did you play all this drama.. for money, dear? You could've been straight about it. She just wants the money. We included a clause in the admission form just for 3rd rangee actors, like you. That is, 'Because of this program, if my body' 'gets affected in any way, I am solely responsible for it.' 'I totally agree for this.' You've given your consent with a signature in English. This is the 6th point in the admission form. Got it? Moreover who knows reason behind illness, was it due to mine or contraceptive pills? She wanted to be a beauty queen. - Disgusting! Men like you rape women and blame the women for it. Mind your words. Please give some respect! Did I invite you to join the program? Who pleaded with me to get you to lose weight so that you can marry an NRI? Who came here pleading? Who pleaded with me to turn a plump girl into a petit one? Lazy... They don't want to do it. They want a easy way out. That can't complain here. Please, get into your job. Go, focus on your weight loss. Come on guys. Go... Why did dad lie, grandpa? He said each time we fail, it will help us reach greater heights. But the truth is, each time I fail, I have only slipped further. I can't fight anymore. Do you remember this, dear? You and your dad, would visit the railway station to pick up tickets from the weighing machine I remember. That machine always found ways to link my weight with my destiny. But I've never understood that. This is the ticket. Your dad asked me to give this to you when you have the need for it. There's nothing in this. There won't be. You have to chalk out your destiny. Your dad wanted you to know who you could possibly be in the future. He has given you his message through this ticket. From this moment on, you have to chalk out your destiny. You have to decide what your future will be. Best of luck! Can you stand up? Go ahead. She was thin in the photograph. But she is too fat now. We can't trust photographs. They could have 'photo-shopped' it. How disgraceful! Will you do just anything to trap my son? We were not planning to cheat you. My son sent you an old photo by mistake. She goes to the 'Size Zero' gym. I guarantee she will lose weight. I am not asking you to go by the photo. He made a mistake for sure. But our girl is standing right in front of you. This is not cheating. - Of course, it is. We came all the way from London after seeing this photo. Just because you want an NRI groom, you can't utter big fat lies! Is it just the photo you've lied about? Or is your daughter already married? The man of the house is no more. They'll do anything. You're sizzling with anger. Let's cool it down. Oh, God! - What are you doing? Do you see any cow here? Then why are you haggling as if you are going to buy cattle? If you don't like me, say no to me. Can you stand up? Will you reject a girl because she is fat? If she gets fat after the wedding, will you divorce her? If girls reject boys for this very reason most boys will have to turn saints. Will you get out on your own or should I ask you to? Oh, God! That glass is ours. - What? Keep it back. Please. - Okay. Thank you. Good morning... Mom. Hey, sweety. Sweety! Sweet! Mom! Mom! What wrong did I do? Why are you sulking? Did you take your tablets, father-in-law? Why are you being childish, mom? Where did that monkey vanish? What wrong did I do, grandpa? Can I just watch someone insulting mom? Having an unmarried daughter at home can only bring me insults. But I have more trouble from my daughter than from other people. Mom, I thought I was your daughter. I didn't know I was 'trouble'. Thanks! I don't eat carbs. This is a yummy 'Jalebi', not carbs. 'Jalebis' don't suit you. An intelligent lady, once said, 'Jalebis' have the answers to all problems. Sweety, I heard about Jyothi. How is she now? How did you fall for the 'Size Zero' gimmick? How could you be that stupid? Your smarter than that! Abhi, I am not smart. I am a fool. There are many fools like me. When I look at the mirror everyday it pains me that I am not beautiful. Every time I watch TV or movies I always wondered when I saw the beautiful heroines, why I was not thinner. Sitting in front of the idiots, who come for looking at me.. I was tensed if he says no. This is foolish thing. For your information, you rejected me. But you accepted my decision. Abhi, I need a help of yours. No one else should go through what Jyothi went through. We should get these frauds arrested. We must do something about it. Charan, the doctors say that the illegal 'fat burners' have caused Jyothi's organs to fail. We must join hands in exposing them. No, Sweety! I am very happy. I've lost 15 kilos because of them. Sorry, Sweety! If I join you, I will not get a refund. I will only get my 7kgs weight back. I've lost 10 kilos after a very long time. My husband is taking me to Europe to celebrate that. Please don't mind I'm saying this. Hi guys, what is today's plan? Simran feels bad about Jyothi's situation. She wants to help us. Thanks. I came to India to film a documentary about cleanliness. But I realise that it's our minds that need cleaning, not toilets. The real problem is neither Satyanand nor the 'Size Zero' clinic. The problem is with people who don't want to face reality. These clinics take advantage of people's insecurities. I don't understand this mad craze to become slim instantly. Sorry Sweety. I didn't mean you. Sweety, we need to begin with changing people's mindset. Is that even possible? Look what I found on the net. We too can upload videos like these. All this is good. But how do we compete with 'Size Zero'? We have to beat them at their game. We have to outdo publicity with more publicity. My friend, Jyothi fell prey to Size Zero's false propaganda that 'Slim is beautiful'. This effort is put together to prevent more people from falling prey to this. If you like this video come forward to help our dying friend. No need of 'Size zero'. Our size is good. This slogan which came in front of us in the form of 'Size Sexy' video has become viral. 'Let us listen to what our audience has to say about it.' 'I met a prospective groom along with his mother last week.' 'They bored me to death with their advice on losing weight.' 'I turned down their advice and told them' 'that 'Size sexy' was the in thing!' 'Girls shouldn't be skinny. - Then? 'They should be a little chubby like you...' 'Oh!' 'I don't know what 'Size Zero' is. But the song was fantastic.' Idealogy is ultimate. -This is first such thing in this country. 'Our yesteryear heroines like Savithri,' 'Vanisri, Sridevi weren't skinny.' 'They were chubby and cute.' 'My kidneys have failed due to 'Size Zero' fat burners.' 'They have to be penalised. No one else should suffer like me.' 'We have to fight this together.' Say no to 'Size Zero' and yes to 'Size Sexy'. Watch out, Sir. Else they will reduce you to 'Size Zero'. The Media is in their favour too. The easy way out is to shut down. There are no permanent friends or enemies in Media or in Politics. A little nudge and you can even make Satan recite the Bible. Oh! Call Nijam Niranjan. - Who? Nijam' Niranjan. Welcome to Aha TV, with your Nijam Niranjan. Post mortem. Miss Soundarya is asking to say no to Size Zero, and it's good to accept own size. Mr Satyanand is here to talk on the topic, to be fat is a pain, 'Size Zero is a gain'. Tell me, Miss Soundarya? How can joining a 'slimming centre' to lose weight be wrong? Losing weight is not wrong. The methods followed to lose weight are wrong. Methods such as 'fat burners'... - No... The audience wouldn't understand that. Let's ask them. Wait for your turn. We are a small, middle-class family. But our son has become a huge burden on us. 'Auto rickshaw' drivers refuse to take him to school and suggest we take him in a truck. He gave us a generous discount and helped my son lead a normal life. It's a got damn set up. They've made fools of us. I am not saying losing weight is wrong. The methods that you use are wrong. They propagate size not good health. Miss Soundarya, you feel they're conning you. But some of them feel you are here for cheap publicity and are saying that this is all a drama just to become famous overnight. What is your view on that? I agree this is a drama. Everyone sitting here is acting with the money you gave them. Haven't you orchestrated this entire thing? 'Even if the sky falls over my head, I have no fear.' 'Let it come, if comes, the botherings,' 'the loss, the anger, let them come.' I think of her as my sister. I didn't want her to suffer the way I did. 'Size Zero' made this family happy. Is that wrong? If you still think I am wrong, punish me. If you think I am a good man, shower me with your love. That was only a stunt aimed at gaining publicity the truth of Miss Soundarya is disclosed. Her plan became topsy turvy. Give me. - What? How long are you going to be in hiding? Come on, Sweety. Sweety, I didn't know you were a coward. Where is that brave girl who rejected me? I didn't reject you. You did! Hey! Abhi, no... That's it? Hey, no... Hey, no... Sweety! Hey, guys! What happened? Greetings, Swamy. I will give you, Rajeswari. Why do you spread hands unnecessarily? Tell me the matter. My mother has become mad and is beating everyone she sees. It doesn't seem like she will get married, in spite of doing so many prayer. Please show us the correct way, Swamy. I will tell you. I will use my special sight power and will tell you. - Okay. That is, Swamy. Rajeswari. - Swamy. There went some mistake in the puja that we did. That is why there are such bad results. So, to see that no mistakes happen this time with concentration and with more effectively will do it as per sastras. I will go to the Himalayas by myself bring the cow and will perform the pujas very sacredly. Then, to the domestic cow like your girl will get a ox like husband. But Swamy, I have a doubt. You always have doubts. You always have doubts. I told you, right? It will go on very effectively. Go now. Stop. - Oh. Not Amba. Okay, Sir. Amba. Jyothi, how are you feeling? I spoke to the doctor. He said there's nothing to worry. 'Size Zero' promised me that it would make my dreams true and give me beautiful life. Make me a promise. No girl should go through this. Promise. Abhi, the 2.5 millions, needed for this operation should be paid by 'Size Zero' Satyanand. Every bad guy will have an enemy. What do you mean? Who stands to lose if this slimming centre's business grows? Almost everyone in fitness industry, gyms, fitness centres. Very impressive, guys. Damn good presentation. It's an interesting stuff. Thank you for your support. I have to thank you! It is a pleasure to participate in such innovative programs. I am glad to work with you. Yes. I am looking forward to working with both of you. Thank for coming, guys. - My pleasure. It was really nice meeting you. I've watched your video a number of times I am a big fan of yours. Thank you. Oh, no. I promised Simran out for a movie. She will kill me and I am 100% sure. I have an idea. - What? She will believe that you have high fever, looking at this picture. I'm sorry, Simran. I couldn't spend time with you. Trust me! I will try to make time for you. That's why I am worried. Do you have to try so hard to spend time with me? Simran, trust me. I am truly trying for it. I will fix it. This is not a machine to fix. This is heart. Abhi, here I am short of ideas for the campaign, but you want to talk about love! No, Sweety! This love is truly confusing. But I don't know how. How do we fall in love? What's the mystery behind it? There are plenty of ways. Sekhar is calling now. Can we discuss this later? Hi, Sekhar! Tomorrow is ad shoot. If you come, it will be nice. Get fit! Don't quit. Sponsored by PVP sports company. Poster girl of beauty 'Soundarya' started this new fitness programme. There is very good response from all over the city. 'Your daughter has become very famous.' 'What do you have to say?' 'How can an unmarried girl do this? She's disgraced the family.' 'How could she dance around like that!' 'I never imagined my daughter will do this to me.' What happened? - Mom is very angry with me. I don't know how to make her happy. Happy? She is going to be proud of you. Sweety, it's very rare to find selfless people like you. You know you're special. You make us all proud. If I had known all this about you the first time we met I wouldn't have let go of you even when you rejected me. 'Did Abhi said that he likes me?' 'Or, am I imagining it unnecessarily?' Hi. - Hi. Sorry. I forgot to tell you. Sekhar and I are going to invite special guests for the campaign. Will get late. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Hey. - Hope all's good. Come. I hope you guys had a nice time. - Yeah. I am so relieved that you chose the man you like. How did you meet her, Abhi? Abhi, we first met near the toilets, do you remember? It was so funny. I thought he was a volunteer and handed him a broom. Tell them, Abhi. Yes. When I met Sweety for the first time I realised we had a strange connection. Abhi, I am not Sweety, I am Simran. Wait. Take this! It's all for you. Give it to your friends as well. If all of you come, we can have fun exercising. Hey, these handouts are not meant to make paper boats or rockets. Read it and get there to help. Stop staring. Now go. You and your stupid look. Disgusting. Brother-in-law, look here. Whatever happens, our next stop has to be at a women's college. That's my order! And that becomes the law. Oh, God! - Why? Do you want to shamelessly get business from them? Work on getting more registrations. Go! - That's a great idea. Sweety, fifty people have registered so far. That's good. Where is Simran? Her parents are here. I met them by chance... I am sure they would have liked you... All the best. Sweety, actually you know what, I want to... English, right? Hi, Sweety! I am a big fan of yours. In fact... The biggest... Hey, who is that? Get lost. Sweety, I love sweets. But after seeing you, even sweets don't taste good anymore. One minute. If you accept my love along with this 'Laddu' my life will get sweeter, Sweety. Please, Sweety. Sweety, please. Sweety... - This is for me. Is it an old stock? - Excuse me, mister. If you don't mind, we have some work to do. You go ahead! I need to speak to Sweety. I've spoken to my parents, they're fine with you. I am sure your parents will be doubly fine with me. I am very excited. So what next? Very much. You come with me. Sweety, marriage expenses are mine. - I will tell you. Come. This unique campaign has got everybody's attention. Don't forget the cause! It's a campaign to save Jyothi. Don't get me wrong. Can't we win her over with money? Else, our business will be shut down. If I do that now, everyone will think she was right. The Media will shut our business down in a jiffy. These cheap tactics don't scare me. Let's see how far this can go. Hello, welcome everybody. Come on. Come on, let's do it together. Come on. Come on. Miss Soundarya. These cycles, wheels, cables and screens, are all confusing. Can you explain this to our audience in simple terms? Not just clarity, you can see it directly. All these cycles are connected to the huge wheel in the centre. When everyone cycles, the energy generated will set the wheel in motion. Come on, let's do it. As the wheel rotates, through the computer connected to it, the over-weight figure on display will lose weight. The screen will give you an update on the amount of calories burnt. The faster you cycle, the faster she loses weight and becomes healthy. Wow! Hi, guys. Are you wondering what the 50,000 is? The 50,000 calories that you lost has a new meaning. There is an important person here to explain you about the new meaning. Let's watch. 'Good evening, people.' 'Fifty thousand...' 'That's not just a calorie count' 'but also the money you earned to save a life.' 'Jyothi, the victim of false claims made by' 'a 'slimming centre', is fighting for her life.' 'PVP sports has come forward to bear' 'the cost of 2.5 million for Jyothi's surgery' 'by contributing a rupee for each calorie that you burn.' 'If we want to save a life, writing a cheque' 'is the easiest thing for me, or for PVP or some other to do.' 'However, the motive of this campaign is to create awareness.' 'This isn't only about our hard-earned money.' 'This is our effort to prevent such injustice from happening again.' 'Every droplet of sweat will make a difference in saving Jyothi's life.' 'So get fit! Don't quit.' Yes! I told you. This game can't go on. Where can a stationary cycle take them? Its a dead game. We've been cycling the last four days. But, we haven't met even half the target. It was a sheer waste of time. My muscles are aching because of cycling. This is not enough. We need more publicity. Malls, colleges, theatres. We have to create more awareness and motivate people. There isn't much time left for Jyothi's surgery. Don't worry, Sweety. Even if we don't achieve the target needed for Jyothi, I will bear the expenses of Jyothi's surgery. She will be okay. I promise. Thanks. But, this campaign isn't just about Jyothi. It's for all the innocent people trapped in webs like these. We have to win! Watch out, mom is here! Look there. I visited Jyothi at the hospital yesterday. It could have been you, I realise how foolish I've been. My mother always encouraged me. She always said I was capable of doing anything. She felt nothing was impossible for me. She would always defend me. The whole world's on one side, and my mother on one side. So this Raji... never bent her head and was never lost. That helped me manage life after your father died. But, I've failed as a mother now. I failed to give you the confidence that my mother gave me. Forgive me. Sweety, we shouldn't spare that arrogant guy who owns 'Size Zero'. We are with you. I brought all my colleagues to support your cause. Which hospital is Jyothi in? An unforeseen development in the 'Save Jyothi' campaign. Jyothi is now saying that her kidney failure wasn't caused by 'Size Zero' but by the indigenous medicines she consumed on her own, to lose weight. Mr. Size Zero Sathyanand is here to make a statement. Mr. Satyanand. Just a minute. Everything is fair in war. It is only about winning! Save Jyothi campaign. All of you know, that this campaign is a cheap tactic used by some people who want to get rid of me. In this land where Mahatma Gandhi was born I believe truth will prevail. Today, I am going to... 'Jyothi, instant gratification is what people want' 'and I am just cashing in on that.' 'That cycling campaign is not going to help you in any way.' 'If the Media gets a more interesting headline' 'the will become sensation and they will forget about you.' 'There is no personal enmity between us.' 'You are not well because of the 'fat burners',' 'given by my company and I apologise for that.' 'Here's Rs. 10 million.' 'You wouldn't have seen this kind of money.' 'Just take this money and withdraw your statement.' 'Be happy.' Tell us, sir. Come on, sir. Tell us. Truth prevails. What is the reason behind her illness? Is it because of your negligence? - What do you say? Sir... Yes. 2.5 million. Sorry for the disturbance, sir. Someone's here asking for you. They're here to cut you to size... Here they are. Please come, Sir. Yes. My parents wants to meet Simran. All the best. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What do you think? - I am not sure, Simran. Abhi, stop running away from yourself. Maybe then you will realise... Simran! You think this is wrong. Right? Because your heart says she is the one for you. Go on, tell Sweety. It's too late. She is getting engaged tomorrow. You wanted an NRI groom but you found a 'prince' right here. Even the Engagement celebration is as grand as a Wedding. You've hit the jackpot! I've waited the last 27 years to pass on this saree I've treasured. That moment has arrived. You are happy, aren't you? I am very happy. 'You can win the universe with love.' 'You can win anything with a smile.' Hi! It's getting late. Both of you change the rings. Give that to her. 'Marriages are made in heaven.' In upstairs. It's getting late. We have to begin the ceremony. Go. Oh, God. My ring. What? Nature's call... Now? - Please. Okay. Carry on, dear! Abhi! Where is the message? My life is incomplete without you, Sweety. Will you marry me? 'That moment when my heart stopped beating...' 'That moment when a confused Sekhar' 'was twirling the engagement ring...' 'That moment when my mom looked on with panic-stricken eyes.' 'That moment when the still smile from' 'my dad's picture showered me with blessings.' 'That moment when the machine at the station' 'was enticing another child into a fairy tale.' 'It was at that moment I realised' 'the Prince Charming who accepted me' 'the way I am, was finally here.' You are late. I only took a 'bathroom-break'. I can't break the engagement. Shall we elope? I promise I won't bore you anymore. I won't give you advice on calories. I will eat all the carbs you give me. Let's be spontaneous and not plan anything anymore. I will also become like you. Useless fellow. I was waiting all along and you tell me this now! Do you realise, you like me, only now? I feel sorry for that poor Prince Charming. He's waiting with a ring for me. What will I tell him? Sorry! Forgive me. Can I tell him that my foolish guy just realised that he can't live without me? Go, hang yourself after 8 pm. Is it? - Mom. Do you have any shame? I had my doubts when you gave a silly excuse to get away from there. Remove your shirt. Untie your saree. Mother! How will you elope? By jumping off from here? That would be a short cut to heaven. Knot the saree around the pillar and you go down first. If the saree doesn't tear despite your weight let my son-in-law follow suit. Did you understand? This seems to be the best plan for now. Mother! I had a feeling history would repeat itself today. Why do you look stunned? Your father was 'Telugu Reddy', and my father was 'Tamil Iyyer'. How do you think we got married? Exactly the same way. Why haven't you removed the shirt? - I'll do it myself. Don't just look, tie this tight. Why do you look confused? What about the people waiting? Do you know the nick name, named for me, by your father? Drama queen. I will prove it practically. I will take care of it. Go on. I was anxious about getting you married but your happiness comes first. Don't worry, dad. Look, her mother is here. Dear! - Aunty! Sweety... Aunty! - Hold her. What happened? - Get some water! Hey! 'It is happiness henceforth.'
