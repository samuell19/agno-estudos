You're cheating! Give me the ball. - Let's go. It's about to rain. - Yeah right, you're tired, just admit it. Look, it's a bird. You're cheating! Game over. You're cheating, just when I'm about to win you want to end the game. Let me tell you something. Trust me, you'll never beat me. Why are you climbing? What? Are you envious because you can't climb? You should learn to climb. - Be careful. You might get struck by lightning. - Or maybe it'll strike you. What are you writing? Read it yourself. What are you writing? Are you making fun of me? If you really want to know, just climb. - Can you? - You think I can't climb? Farel? Farel. Don't joke around, okay? Farel. Wake up, Farel. Farel. Gotcha! Jerk!

Your comic is fantastic. I've read comics from all over the world, but yours is the funniest. It's even funnier than 'Sinchan'. Luna... Can I have your phone number and address? Can I? Thank you. Are you done? Thank you. Anything else? The address is kind of hard to find. Can you draw me a map? - Do you know the roundabout on this road? - Yes. 100 meters from there on the right side... ... there's a white house, That's my house. Luna!

She's pretty, feminine... - ... has a good sense of humor, and she is... - Wait a second. - She's your ideal girl? - Yes. But I'm not sure that you are her ideal guy. Farel, stop it! - I'm all wet.

The comic author with such a great sense of humor. Would you like to see it? Rachel... Is it not funny enough? It's funny. But I don't think it's suitable for Luna. If you want to understand Luna, read her comic. This is the story of a lonely little fairy... ... who is awaiting her death. This is the first time I read a comic that moved me to tears. Little fairy who is awaiting her death. How sad, living a life of no hope. Why are you laughing? Nothing. It just felt funny. What's so funny? I'm sure anyone who read your comic, will be sad. No, it's not about the fairy. I just remembered that moment at the flower shop when you said... ... my comic is funny, funnier than 'Sinchan'. I didn't mean that. The man at the bookstore lied to me. But after reading your comic... I think it's excellent. But I don't want you... ... to be lonely like the fairy in your comic. You have to be like those happy little fairies. Flying with their lovely wings. Sparkling magnificently. Like stars in the sky. - I won. - Not yet. Once again, okay? - Okay. - Once again, okay? - Okay. Chel, your idea was brilliant. Because of you I can understand Luna. Thanks a lot. I'm happy if you're happy. - Okay? - Okay. Chel! Cheater! - You're cheating! - No, I'm not. I won. - You're cheating. - I won, that's what matter. Stop it! Luna. - Hi. - Hi. This is Rachel, my friend since childhood. - Hello, Luna. - Rachel. I wanted to ask Farel out. Will you join us? I can't. Sorry. I can't. I have lots of things to do. Why? I have to finish lots of assignments. Rachel is majoring in architecture. I'm having my end-term exam so works been piling up. That's too bad. Maybe next time. - Okay. - Well, I'm going. - Sorry. - It's okay. Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. - Goodbye. - Bye. I've always come to this place. It's cool. So peaceful. Farel... Look at that turtle. It's her loneliness... That inspired me... ... to create the character of that lonely fairy. But from now on she won't be alone anymore. Let him go Farel. So she will have a friend, like me who's no longer alone. - May their togetherness be eternal. - Yes. Like us. The boat is leaking. You can swim, can't you? Farel... You can swim, can't you, Luna? Are you okay? I'm fine. You look so pale. I'm okay. Luna, please tell me what to do? I'm so cold. I'm cold. I'm freezing. I'm freezing. Farel... Get in. What's up with your ears? What is it? - Let me see. - What are you doing? - Let me see. You wear earrings? Does it look good? Let me take a look. It suits you. A bit prettier. Chel... Looks like, I won't be able to play basketball today. I have a date with Luna. But I will drive you to the basketball court. It's okay. Actually I wanted to tell you that... ... I also won't be able to play basketball today. Because... ... I have a date with a guy. - A Guy? - Yes. We've just met. But he seemed... ... to fit the criteria of my ideal guy. Who is he? You'll find out soon enough. - I'm already late. Get out. - What's up? - Get out, hurry. Rachel... Rachel! It's nothing. I just want to say... I'm happy that you've found your ideal guy.

It's raining. I should've asked a shaman to prevent raining. I don't get it. I'm sure she wanted it too. But I really don't understand... Why's she suddenly hesitated? Luna was right. Love doesn't have to be expressed with a kiss. Love is togetherness. Sharing with each other. Supporting each other. Filling each others lives. Love is happiness... ... seeing the joy of your loved one is happiness. So is that what you've experienced with your new boyfriend? Yes. He really understands the meaning of love. Hey... Why are you crying? Because... ... this is the first time I felt such love. For as long as we've been friends... ... I've never felt this way. Never. Farel. Love has to be expressed. You must tell the one you love that you love her. Women need assurance. Okay. Now's the moment where you have to show Luna... How much you love her. Yes. So she knows... ... that my life is meaningless without her. Are you serious about our plan? Of course I'm serious. Do you think I'm lying? If she refuses my love,... you just step on it... And run over me until I'm dead. Okay? Okay. If Luna refuses my love,... it means this is our last meeting. I don't want to leave behind a debt. Here... This is what I owed you from campus. Rachel. Give me back my 10.000. I only owed you 40.000. Okay, then. Take good care of yourself. Okay, just a minute. Farel. I thought you were somebody else. - Please come in. - Luna... I've come with this symbol of my love. With this symbol I want to tell you... ... that I love you. If you accept this symbol,... it means that you accept my love. But if you break this symbol,... it means that you refuse my love. And over there is a car that will run over me. Stop it. Don't joke around. I'm not kidding. Farel... Farel. - Quit joking around. - I am not. Please don't push me... ... because there is something that you don't understand. There is no other way Luna. I need your answer right now. Accept this symbol or break it. Accept my love or refuse it. You don't understand. I need your answer right now. I can't do this. Give me your answer right now! Okay If you insist. Farel! Actually... ... I want to be like that turtle, who has now found her pair. But wishes don't always come true. Fact is... ... I'm the lonely fairy who is awaiting her death. What do you mean? I'm sick Farel. Cirrhosis. There's no longer any chance for recovery. I'm just waiting for the time to come. And that time will come soon. I love you, Farel. But it's for naught. Because all this is futile. Luna... I love you. No matter what... I will always love you. Here it's your turn again. Then stand here. Be serious. - You were serious, weren't you? - What's wrong with you? What? Running me over. Farel. Didn't you asked for it yourself? "Run over me until I'm dead." "I might as well be dead, if Luna refuses my love." I've known you since we were little. I know how much you love her. I supported you. And now you're blaming me? Now our friendship means nothing. Forget our friendship, forget our past. We no longer know each other! Rachel! Never ever say my name again, as if we've never met! - We're over! - What are you saying? Okay, we're friends again. I'm still your best friend... ... who is ready to help you fulfill your dreams. Rachel. I'm not sure. If all this can give Luna the spirit to live? Farel, take it easy. Give Luna a call. Ask her out to dinner. Let me wrap the gift. You just give it to her. Okay? Hello? What are you doing? Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? She said... She never wanted to see me again. She said... I have to forget about her. Then she hung up. ♪ Please don't give me hope ♪ ♪ As if you want it but you don't ♪ ♪ All I ask is your sincerity ♪ ♪ Not pretension ♪ So this is how the lonely fairy wastes her time awaiting death? You're running away from reality. The reality that... ... there is a guy who is truly in love with you. Willing to share, accompany... ... and to accept you as you are. It isn't me Rachel. Farel is the one running away from reality... ... that I'm on the verge of death. Has it ever crossed you mind that... ... maybe God has let you met Farel... ... because God wanted you to know... ... that nothing in this world is meaningless. Have you ever thought that every second of your life, God has showered you with God's love? Thinking about death is pointless. It doesn't matter what you think, death will come anyway. Do whatever that would make you happy. And you're supposed to be happy. You've met the guy that you love. And he loves you... ... with all his heart. Rachel... - It's Luna. - Answer it. Hello. What? Yes. Okay. Bye. What is it? - It's Luna... - What about her? - She said she was sorry. She was sorry that all this time she's been avoiding me. Ever since you came to her house, she said that you were right. One shouldn't avoid love. - Chel, thanks so much. - You're breaking my bones. - Okay, just go, get ready. - Thank you very much. - Sure. - Thank you... - Just go, get ready. ♪ Have you ever lived through ♪ ♪ the most beautiful days ♪ ♪ I engraved our name together ♪ ♪ Here is our heaven ♪ ♪ If we love someone else ♪ ♪ Would this heart be strong ♪ ♪ I will try my best ♪ ♪ to keep my love from fading away ♪ ♪ If you love somebody could we be this strong ♪ ♪ I will fight to win our love will conquer all ♪ ♪ Wouldn't reach my love ♪ ♪ Even just one night ♪ ♪ Our love will stay in my heart ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ - Wait, I forgot about her gift, I'll go get it. - Chel...

I'll always make you happy. I will never leave you lonely. Rachel. What is going on? What is the matter with you? Are you upset? What? Answer me. What's the matter with you? Are you angry with me? Give me the ball. You're angry because I don't have time for you anymore. Because I've been spending more time with Luna, is that it? Why should I be angry, huh? All this time I've been supportive of your relationship with Luna, right? - So give me the ball. - No! Give me an explanation... Why you have suddenly changed? Do you think you're losing me? What has changed? I'm still the same Rachel. Your friend who is always supporting you. And always willing to share. Oh, no. Give me the ball. Just go. Chel, are you sure you're okay? I'm fine.

I do need time, you know to go out, have dinner, watch movies... ... or maybe just listening to his silly jokes. When are you going to introduce me to him? That time will come. Okay then, best of luck. That hurts, you know? Liar! You said you were going out with your boyfriend. No wonder you didn't want to introduce me to him. Liar.

You said you wanted to go out... watch movies, liar! What is this? It's for Luna. Beautiful isn't it? Yes, it's beautiful. I'm sure Luna will be happy. Don't be sad, Chel. You're my best friend. You shouldn't feel like you've lost a friend. Okay? I'm not sad because I feel I'm losing my best friend. I'm sad because... I've just lost the guy I'm in love with. What do you mean? I've just lost the guy... ... that I've been telling you about. So, this guy... - You're not making it up? - Yes. He is really my ideal guy. He's smart, romantic,... has a great sense of humor... He's full of surprises... Sometimes he's annoying... But he makes me happy... ... just like you do. I just realized that I really do love him. But his love is not for me. He left me for another girl. Rachel. They're beautiful, aren't they? Yes, they are. I can't decide which one I should choose. I wish I could just pick all of them. So my house would be filled with a sea of flowers. Maybe it would be better if we buy the seeds. Yes, you're right. It'll be fun. I could nurture them. I could water them every day. Watch them grow. Until finally... ... beautiful flowers bloom. I want to give you something. What is it? Just open it. Farel. This is really beautiful. Luna. I love you. I never want to be apart from you. I want to always be with you. Now please wear this ring. As a sign that you also don't want to be apart from me. Okay? Either this ring is too small... ... or my ring finger is too big. - I can't put in on. - Hold on. Actually, I bought the ring not for your ring finger,... but for your little finger. Let's try it. Thank you, Farel. You're really are... ... the most wonderful gift God has given to me. Wait, wait. Farel. Farel. I hope... ... the seeds that we planted... ... will bloom into beautiful flowers. Hey. Give us the ball. Come on. The ball. Just roll it over. Come on. Just give us the ball. Whoa... Just roll the ball. All right. Come on. Come on. - Oh man. - Hey Hey. Hey. What? Come on. - Would you come inside? - I'd better go home. - Come on. Why? Why? You really make me feel alive again. Now I feel... ... something that I've never felt before. The happiness of loving someone... ... and being loved by someone. - Let me go home, okay? - No. My lipstick is on your lips. This isn't lipstick. Why is my lipstick all messy like this? Please believe me, it's not your lipstick. - Let me take you to the hospital. - Farel. No. I'm fine. Luna. It's my lipstick. It's only lipstick. - Farel, what are you doing? - I'm calling your Dad. What for? Why should we tell him? Farel, please take me home. Just a minute, Luna. If you don't want to take me home, I'll go by myself. Don't you see? I'm fine. - I can even run. - Luna... No! Don't! Rachel. Chel, what happened to you? Chel, I'm going to check on Luna. I'll be back okay. Where is her family? Where are her parents? Her father is on the way. How is she, Doc? Cirrhosis. Her only hope is a donor. Please excuse me. Farel. Luna. I want to go home. Please be patient. When you get better, we'll go home. I want to go home. - I want to go home. - Luna... Luna. It's Daddy. Rachel, please eat. If you don't eat, you won't get better. Please eat just a little. She doesn't want to eat. Chel, you must eat, even for a little. Let me try, Ma'am. She hasn't eaten since yesterday. I'll feed you, okay? I'll get you shredded meat, okay? She likes shredded meat. Maybe she'll eat it. I'll be back. Come on please eat. Here. - Just a little. - No. You know what? A friend feeding friend, is it a right or a duty? It's a rights. No! I'm not a baby! What are you doing here? Go take care of Luna. At least shell have a chance to live when she gets a donor. While my life is over. My future is grim. Life has no meaning anymore. The doctor said my leg has to be amputated. Can you imagine me without a leg? I don't want to be amputated. I still want to keep my leg. I don't want to be amputated, Farel. I know... ... you won't give up even if your leg has to be amputated. I've known you since we were little. You know something? What I admire so much about you? It's your spirit. You never give up on anything. Trust me... Even though your leg has to be amputated, your life wouldn't change much. It won't be as bad as you thought. We can still play and joke around. I love you as a friend. From the time we were little, till now and forever. I'd like to see the Rachel that I knew before... ... who would never give up even in the worst situation. Chel, trust me. Sir... She had woken up. But she's fallen asleep again. Luna is my only child. Last time she called me... ... she told me so much about you. She sounded so happy. I've never seen her that happy. She told me that she's working on her comic. She said... ... she created a character in her comic, a happy and joyful fairy. And that fairy, she named her 'Love Fairy'. Farel... Why am I here? - I told you I'm fine. - Luna. You're being treated by the best doctor in this hospital, you'll be fine. I'm not sick, Dad. - I'm fine. - Do not move so much. - I'm fine, Dad. I want to go home. - Okay. - I'll talk to the doctor first. Okay? - Okay. Let me be honest with you... ... there is no hope at all. Then what should we do, Doc? To tell you the truth, all this time... ... we're only giving her medicine to ease the pain. But not to heal her illness. Let her go home if she wants to. Being at home would make her happier. - Good morning. - Morning. - You're going home today? - Yes. - Feeling any better? - Yes. Here is the letter from her doctor. And this is to be settled with the hospital administration. - Thank you, Nurse. - You're welcome. Take good care of yourself. I'm fine, Farel. Your look so pale. I'm so happy I'm going home. I can hardly wait to... ... nurture and water the seeds we had planted. Don't think so much. Although they let you go home, you still need a lot of rest. I also want to continue my comic. About fairies who flew with their beautiful wings. Farel. Really, I'm fine. You know what? We can go to some places,... to the lake... to see the turtles. Riding bicycle. We can also... ... eat in the rain. She's asleep. And still refuses to eat. She's still unable to accept that her leg needs to be amputated. Chel, I'm going to accompany Luna home. She wants to go home. She knows there is no hope for her life. She knows that it would be useless to wait for a donor. I will be by her side till her last day. Then... ... I'll be with you. I will come visit you. Ma'am, I'm leaving. I'm going, Chel. I'm okay, Dad. Farel, look. These are the seeds that we planted. They're starting to grow. The rain must've been watering them all this time. How long do you think we have to wait until they bloom? I'm sure it'll be soon. We picked quick growing seeds, didn't we? Yes. I'll nurture them. I'll give them fertilizers. Waters them daily. It'll be fun... watching them grow... ... and bloom beautifully. I will learn how to arrange flowers. Wouldn't you like to have a wife who could do flower arrangement? - Yes. - Then, what else? What kind of wife would you like to have? A wife who can cook, sew? I know your favorite dishes, I know what I should prepare for you. You just came back from the hospital. You still need a lot of rest. Farel, believe me... when we get married,... I'll try my best to be a good wife. Luna, you don't have to do anything. I love you as you are. Your love means everything to me. Luna. It's late. Farel, come here, come. Look at this. Isn't it beautiful? Yes it is. It's very beautiful. It would look even better... ... once I have finished coloring it. You shouldn't get too tired. Farel, you must see this after I've finished coloring it. I'm still not sure about the ending. I have several alternatives in mind. Do you have any suggestions? Farel. You must be very tired. Looking after me all night long at the hospital. Hi, morning. You woke up just in time. Have some tea. While I'm preparing toasted bread for breakfast. My dad didn't have time to have breakfast with us. He left in a hurry after receiving a phone call. I don't know who called. Probably one of his business associates. Are you okay? As you can see. I don't look like a sick person, do I? By the way, which jam would you prefer? Chocolate, pineapple or strawberry? Wait, wait. Let me guess. You will choose... Close your eyes. - Why? - Just close your eyes. - Okay. Now open your eyes. Let's see, which jam you prefer? Strawberry. - How do you know? - Of course I know. I have a psychic talent. I can guess what you're thinking and what you're feeling. - Is that so? - Sure. - Then guess this. What I'm feeling right now? Hmm, let me see... Hello. Yes? Luna... Excuse me, Sir. Please wait outside. How is she, Doc? Well... ♪ I'm crying ♪ ♪ for you have gone ♪ ♪ Leaving me with a thousand sorrows ♪ ♪ I've lost you ♪ ♪ I could never see you again ♪ ♪ Like it used to be ♪ ♪ I had lost you ♪ Please forgive me... ... for not being able to attend her funeral. It's all right. I'm sure Rachel will understand. Before she passed away... ... she asked me to give you this letter. Farel my best friend... I wrote this letter... ... while remembering our friendship which was filled with joy and laughter. We have played basketball since we were little. Running around by the foothills. You made me a beautiful crown out of leaves. They were all too beautiful for me to remember. We were so close. Until you found Luna and fell in love with her. It's very difficult for me to explain how I feel. I'm glad to see you happy. But I don't know why all of a sudden I also felt that I've lost something. Sometimes I'm jealous because you have no time for me. I was really shocked... ... when doctor told me that my leg has to be amputated. Without my leg,... I can no longer play basketball with you... ... while laughing and chasing each other in the rain. I finally realized... ... that I didn't want to lose you. But It will happen anyway. Because I know... ... you really love Luna. And someday... ... you will marry her. I don't want words of goodbye between us, Farel. So for that reason... ... I finally decided to donor what Luna needed most. With a part of my being inside Luna... ... I can always be with you. Even until you are married and have children. Through a part of me I donated for Luna,... I can be by your side forever. Through my liver that's now inside Luna's body,...
