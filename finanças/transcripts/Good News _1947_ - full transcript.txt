Hey, hop in, we're going down to watch football practice. No, thank you. Hey, there's the dean. - Wow, get a load of that! - Who is it? She's the new pledgee at our sorority, Pat McClellan. A transfer from the Black Briar Finishing School. And I do hope you'll like it here, Ms, McClellan. I love it already, Dean Griswold. You've been absolutely charmant. Why, uh... - Goodbye, Ms. McClellan. - Au revoir! - Oh, hello, Babe. Hello, McClellan. Everybody, this is Pat McClellan. - Hi, Pat. - Hi, Pat. Enchantee. Enchantee. Hey, wait till Tommy Marlowe gets a load of that. How men'" fa" for a pretty face. - You said it. - So long, kids. Hey, last chance to go to the field. Aw, football! Well, what are we waiting for, kids? Come on, let's go. Okay, fellows, I hate to say it, that was a pretty nice practice. Thompson, watch your passing. Zubrowski, uh, nice broken field running. Beef, I'll get to you later. What do you think you're doing? I'm just warming up. Can't hang up a cold uniform. Come on, Bobby, get your uniform off. Oh, gee, Pooch, I get so little chance to wear it. I like to keep it on till the last minute. Sometimes I even rub a little dirt on it just to convince myself I'm really on the team. Don't worry, Bobby, you'll get off the bench this year. Gee, I hope so. All the girls want football heroes. Come on, come on. Well, I guess that's about all. You can go to the party tonight. And you can stay out till ten o'clock. - Oh... - Listen, you crybabies! You're not gonna be so social this year. We're not running a mahjong society. I want you all out for early practice. And don't forget, this is just the beginning. The first game's just a week off. Okay. Good going, Marlowe. You're in the pink. You're gonna be better than last year. Thanks, coach, I owe it all to Poochie. Yes, I made him work this summer. We're gonna win every game this year. - Including the one with Colton. - Don't say it. You can think it, but don't say it out loud! - Evil spirits don't like it. - Evil spirits? You're lucky you're the best trainer in this racket. And another thing, Tommy. You gotta stay away from the women this year. Remember, you're a football player. - Not Rudolph Valentino. Don't worry. Women will never interfere with the way I play. I can take 'em or leave 'em. I wish a certain another player could say the same. - Beef. - Yes, sir? - Where were you today? - Right here on the field. Oh, yeah? Your delicate body may have been there. But that dumb head of yours was off someplace worrying about that flapper Babe Doolittle. You're right, coach. But I'll be alright. - I'm studying psychology. - Psychology! It's black magic. Leave it alone. No! It teaches you to act natural. You shouldn't have any repressed hostilities. If you got somethin' inside of you, you should let 'em come out. So I want to announce right now if anyone comes near Babe Doolittle, I'll kill him! Wow! You tell 'em, Beef. That's love. - Alright, Bobby, hurry up. - Hey, Tommy. Have you met the new bombshell yet? - Who? - The new Phi Gamma Gamma. Patricia McClellan, she's burning up the campus inch by inch. Haven't you seen her yet? No. I let the gals come to see me.

If I do anymore of this, I won't have any strength left for the party. What do you need strength for? Beef has to be home by 10:00. Listen, I'm through with football stars that have to be home by 10:00. My new passion is Bobby Turner. That skeleton? He's got about as much appeal as a string bean. He's nothing. Yeah, he's nothing. He's on the scrub team. He can stay out all night. Oh, I'm mad about him. Does the lucky boy know about this? - No, but he will tonight. - Of all the nerve! She can't do this to me. Where's Connie? Hey, look at that thing. What is it? - Pat McClellan's dress. - Oh, gee. - Wow! - She made me fix it for her. I don't have to do that. I'm gonna tell Connie. Come on, she's in the kitchen. - Connie! Connie! Here I am. - What's the trouble, Elizabeth? - Oh, it's that Pat McClellan. Connie, do you know what she asked me to do? - Sew some beads on her dress. - No! - Yes! - Who does she think she is? Marie Antoinette? Give me a wrench, Cora. Connie, maybe you can say something to her. I don't know what I'd like to say her. - Oh, give me a rag, Cora. - Here. - Let me look at that thing. - Cora, give me a... Holy smoke! - Is this the dress? - Yeah. What do you think of it, Connie? Isn't it the cat's? Just out of the "Ziegfeld Follies." - Where does it need fixing? - It doesn't anymore. - I fixed it. - You didn't. Well, I'd already done it before I remembered to get mad. Maybe I'd better have a talk with Ms. McClellan. Yeah, but what about the sink, Ms. Connie? - It's fixed. - Now, Connie. Don't have any harsh words with her, dear. She's a new pledgee and doesn't know any better. You're perfectly right, Mrs. Drexel. After all, she is just out of finishing school. You wonderful creature. Why does everyone love you? Why are you so divine, so clever, so popular? Mm... I sure wish someone loved me the way you love you. Why, Connie Lane. You know I was only fooling, n'est-ce pas? Sounded like true love to me. Here's that burlap bag you wanted fixed. How sweet of you to bring it up. Merci, merci. Look, Pat, as long as you're gonna live here in the house with us, there are a few things I... Why, of course. Naturally. Um, that dress, for instance. For a little sorority party, it's rather extreme. - Extreme? Really? - And obvious. Obvious? Yes? It's Babe. Can we come in? - Entrez. - Entrez. - Sure. I hate to interrupt this little tete-a-tete, but the sheiks will be here any minute. Oh, you'll slay 'em in that dress, Pat. Yes, and they're all pretty impressionable. - Have you met any of them yet? - Not yet. But I hope to meet all the worthwhile ones. Well, let's see now. Which ones are really, really worthwhile? This Eddie Dunkelman, he's quite a catch. His father's the local butcher. He... he's a little short and a little fat, but he does a mean Charleston. You know, Pat, the boy for you is Tommy Marlowe. We're all just crazy about him. - Tommy Marlowe? Who's he? - Mm-hmm. Why, he's only the captain of the football team. - And what a sheik. - You know, girls. I think college contacts are terribly important. It's tres necessaire to find someone of the right background and sufficient wealth of culture. Oh, that's so true. Is $25 million enough culture for you? Peter Van Dyne III has it. Richest man at Tait. - Van Dyne III? - Oh, but he's such a drip. For $25 million, let him drip. You mean to say he's not an attractive boy? Attractive? He's the twerpiest wet smack of all time. - Que! Fromage. - Oh, what did you say? I said, quel fromage. That's, what a pity, in French. Oh, you must mean dommage. Fromage means cheese. Quel fromage. What cheese. Oh, of course, dommage. How silly of me. Hey, come on. The fellows are here. - Oh, is Bobby here? - Oh, I'm not ready yet. You were, uh, saying about the dress? Oh, forget it, Pat. I was wrong. The dress suits you perfectly. Nice party, Mrs. Drexel. But I want the team out of here by ten o'clock. Of course, Mr. Pooch. That's understood. Gee, I love to dance. I feel like I'm not even touching the floor. You're not. It's heavenly with you in my arms. - Let's go out on the porch. - Uh-uh, Let's dance. You don't love anybody else but me, do you? Oh, no, Beef. You just don't understand me. I'm sort of like that psychology thing you were telling me about. - I'm a split personality. - Oh. Well, if anyone comes near you, they'll be a split personality. Uh-huh. Psst! - Hey, what are you doing? - Oh, nothing. Beef, look at poor Connie. You've simply gotta help her. Connie! Connie! Beef's dying to help out. Give him something to do. Oh, fine. Would you help me pass these? - Sure. - Thanks. - Well, Bobby, here I am. - What? It's time for that dance I promised you. Go away! Beef said he'd kill anybody that came near you. - Well, wouldn't it be worth it? - No! - Hey, what's going on? - Take it easy, Bobby! Something's wrong. Bobby, you and me are soul mates. - What? - I won't take no for an answer. Tell me you love me. Look at that. Goose pimples. Think it's cold? It's you. Yeah, well, look at that. Goose pimples. You think it's you? Uh-uh. It's Beef. Let me go! There's nothing like a college education. - Oh, Tommy, where've you been? - Tommy! Girls, girls, don't rush me. Where is this gorgeous creature that I've been hearing so much about? - Oh, McClellan isn't down yet. - Oh, Tommy. Now, don't worry. I'll be back. - Hi, Tommy. - Hi, Evelyn. Well, what is this, the waiting room? Oh! We can all go home now. Marlowe is here. Thanks. This is quite a turnout. You know, if this show isn't any good, I'm gonna want my money back. Alright, before the show starts I have a little announcement to make. You are about to witness one of nature's marvels, Patricia McClellan, the female form divine. The jungle potentates have fought for one smile from her cruel lips. Alright! For only ten cents, one tenth part of a dollar, you will actually see this little lady descend these stairs placing one dainty foot before the other. Alright, watch, uh, wa... Oh, Pat, my dear, some of these boys you already know, but I'd like to introduce you to a few more. Patricia McClellan, Clyde Waters. Oh, Richard Tripper. Eddie Dunkelman. - Hello. - And I'm, uh, Tommy Marlowe. Oh. That was a charming speech you made, Mr. Marlowe. You've obviously spent most of your life in a freak show. I was only kidding, Ms. McClellan. You're really terrific. But I'll tell you more about you while we're dancing. - Shall we go on, Mrs. Drexel? - Oh, yes. Uh, this is Grover Smith. And this is Peter Van Dyne, III. Van Dyne? Mr. Van Dyne, III, I've heard so much about you. I believe my mother might've met your mother at Newport. - Well, that's very possible. - Yes. - Would you care to dance? - Oh, I'd love to. Kind of cold in here, isn't it? Yeah, Tommy, how does it feel to get the brush? - How do you like her, Tommy? - Ah, she's not so hot. Just trying to May hard to get. Hey, Danny! And you're the first touch of refinement I've found here. The first person I can really talk to. That makes me very happy. I'd like to make you a hundred million times as happier. A hundred million? Oh, Peter, you don't know what... Excuse me, my lord, could I interest you and the duchess in a moldy canape? - Not very funny, Marlowe. - Oh. I'll try one first, my lord, in case you suspect poison. Which isn't a bad idea. You're more at home in a freak show. - You were saying... - Van Dyne! - Van Dyne. - Yes, what is it? Phone call for you, long distance. New York. - What? Where, inside? - No, at the dormitory. Dormitory? Well, I'd better scoot. Pat, I'll only be a few minutes. It'll seem like eons, my dear. Oh, poor Peter. I... I hope it isn't bad news. Ten o'clock! Football team out of here, pronto! Everybody out. - Isn't that your cue? You do have something to do with football, don't you? Are you kidding? Why, I'm the captain of the team. Pat, I... I don't get this. What's the matter with me? I'm... I'm a pretty popular guy. - Really? - Why... Looks like this year I'll be all-American. All-American? Does that mean you become a citizen? Oh, come on, Pat. Don't be an iceberg. - Y... you gotta melt someday. - Mr. Marlowe. Haven't I made it clear to you that I don't like you? Look, Pat, I'll spin you into town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner, go dancing somewhere, just the two of us. I'll pick you up at 6:00. Okay? - Quelle effronterie! - Pat? - Pat, my dear. - Peter, Peter, what is it? I phoned the dormitory, it's some kind of a trick. There was no call for me at all. No call? Well, I think I better be going. Yes, sir, and, uh, don't forget about tomorrow night. I'm glad you could stay, Peter. So am I. I just knew when I came down those stairs that this was going to be my lucky night.

Oh, yes, but I naturally thought you made some mistake. This is scarcely the favorite hangout for the football team. Oh, I don't know what you mean, I've often been in here doing research, you know? Not in the past three years, you haven't. - What makes you say that? - I work here, Mr. Marlowe. I'm the assistant librarian. In that case, I'll never lie again. But, uh, how come you look so familiar? Where have I seen you before? Oh, you've seen me a 100 times in the past three years. In fact, you stood right next to me at the punch bowl last night. - My name is Connie Lane. - Babe's roommate! Oh, for crying out loud, then you're a student. Yes. Well, what do you wanna work here for? Oh, it helps pay my tuition. It's something called working your way through college. Oh, I'm sorry. At your service. Well, uh, where's the French dictionary? I wanna look up a word. Oh, I'm majoring in languages. What do you wanna know? You ever heard of a French word in-courage-gee-bull? Oh, you must mean incorrigible. That's the one. What does it mean? Same thing it means in English. Impossible, incorrigible. - Past reforming. - That's what I thought. And Ms. McClellan spoke the word beautifully. I heard it all the way in the kitchen. Oh, yeah, well, I'm gonna give her that parlez-vous right back again. Who's the best French teacher in school? Professor Kennyon. I'll sign up for a course with him. Oh, don't get carried away. Kennyon is a tough bird and he hates football players. I've never flunked a subject yet. I'll bet it's easy. - Come on, show me a few words. - Oh, don't be silly. - It's closing time. - Oh, come on.

I wanted to find out about everybody in the whole world. Uh, don't bother with that now. Come on. You know, there was a little creek back home. I used to take a canoe and make-believe that I was traveling to all the countries I'd ever read about. Bread and butter. Bread and butter. I was Huck Finn going down the Mississippi and down the Volga, the Nile and the Seine, all of 'em. And then sometimes at night I'd just sit there in my canoe and look up at the stars. I used to look up at them from our rooftop in Chicago and think of all the people all over the world looking up at the same stars and... Thinking about 'em in lots of different languages. Yeah, now the whole world just seems to be little Tait College. I never think about anything but being a big football star. Well, that'll be over in a few months, and then what? Oh, as long as you don't forget about that boy in the canoe, you'll be fine. I think he has a great future. You're quite a girl. You know, when I walked in here a few minutes ago, I... I was feeling kind of sorry for you. - Why? - Oh, I don't know, uh... Having to work your way through school and missing a lot of good times. Not having the best things in life.

La main, les yeux, la bouche. - What does that mean in French? - Embrasser. Embrasser? It's just as nice in both languages, isn't it? Gee, what a vocabulary I got. Wait till I spring this on Pat. That'll put a dent in her. Why don't you just hit her over the head with a hockey stick? And so we'll review the use of the French pronoun for the benefit of those who have come into the class late. Il, he or it. Elle, she or it. Il est, he is. Elle est, she is. Ils, they, plural, masculine. Are you sure he's in this class? Yeah, they'll be out any minute now. Pooch, you gotta do something. It's a downright case of French schizophrenia if I ever saw one. Oh. Oh. Well, don't worry. I'll see that he gets rid of all this bologna. You just leave it to Poochie. Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Good luck in the game tomorrow, Tommy. - Huh? What? - Good luck in the game. - The opening game! - Tomorrow, remember? It's in the bag. Thanks. - Je t'aime. - Oh, it's in the bag, eh? Hiya, Poochie, what's the matter? You and your French course. That's what's the matter. You're gonna flunk it. Then where will our team be? Oh, dry up, Poochie. Je t'aime, je t'adore. Les yeux bleus. - What's that? - This is my French speech. I'm gonna spring it on a certain little Sheba this afternoon. Oh, I get it. It's that McClellan dame. Tommy, have you gone nuts? Yes! And another thing, the boys don't understand a word you're saying on the field. They're waiting for the signals. You give them the signals, but they're in French! Sure. Quarante-et-un, dix-huit, soixante-neuf, onze. Hup! Guess I can't help it, Poochie. Language comes easy to me. I've only been in the class five days, and already I'm speakin' like a native. I don't know of what country, but, uh, like a native. Comes easy, huh? Well... Do you think that your parlez-vous Francais is gonna charm Crenshaw off of the field tomorrow? - Do you? Do you? - I... I don't know about that. But it's gonna charm McClellan into going to the prom with me tomorrow night. Alright, Poochie, vamoose. I gotta study my speech. Hey, Tommy! - My chauffeur! - Yeah? - I found her. She's at Gimpeldinger's having a soda with Van Dyne. Alright, keep the engine boiling. I'll be right down. Ah. "Je t'adore, je t'aime. Vous etes merveilleux." Buh-bye. Hi, Pooch. Can I drop you someplace? - Yeah, over the nearest cliff. - Gee! Anything wrong? Things are so wrong, we may wind up using you on the team. - Well, what's wrong with that? - Nothing. If your money is on the opposite team. Babe, go away! Is that all you have to say to me? No! Leave me alone! How long have you been in this car? I hopped in when you drove by the soda shop. I just had an ice-cream cone and a glass of milk. By now it's a malted. Can't you see I'm trying to say I love you? Uh, listen, I told you the other night that I won't have anything to do with you. I value my life. I love life, and I wanna live! Sure, I like you and all that, and if circumstances were different, well, you and me, that might be how I'd like it to be. To be, to be or not to be, that is the question. Where the government of the people, by the people, and for the people give me liberty or give me... - Oh, hello, Beef. - Who are you talkin' to? Uh, nobody. I was practicing a little speech. I thought I saw you here with someone. - With somebody? - Yeah, Babe. Well, how silly. Just us two. Just jalopy and me. And baby makes three. - You sure she wasn't here? - Posi-lutely, abso-tively. Turner, you don't like Babe, do you? Like her? I can't stand her, silly little flapper. What do you mean, "Silly little flapper?" No, I mean, she's great! She's the bee's knees! She's the cat's meow and she loves you. Oh, yeah? - What'd you say? I said, "Oh, yeah." Oh, yeah, yeah. She loves you. Yes, sir! I'm glad you said that, because if you hadn't have, I might've done this. Hey, my fender! You know how upset I get over Babe! I'm a highly tense person. You know when you keep your inhibitions locked up tight sometimes they just break open! Ow! - Huh? I said, ow, when you hurt this car, it's just like hurting me. When I lose control, I just get shaken up from bottom to top! - You don't know how I suffer! - Beef, not so loud. My car! - Oh, is this your car? - It was. Gee, I'm sorry. When I get mad, I don't know what I'm doing. - It's like I'm hypnotized. - Oh, that's alright. Give me a lift over to Gimpeldinger's, will you? Sure. Hop in. No, no, in front! Come on, fellows, let's go. Hey, Bobby, you better take better care of your car. - It's getting a little shabby. - No, no, in front! All out for Gimpeldinger's! Well, old place hasn't changed much. Wonder if McKinley's still president. Ah, bonjour, mesdames messieurs. Coming up, Tommy. Elle knows who elle is. Mademoiselle. Beat it, Marlowe. Mademoiselle, I have composed a little speech just for you in your own language. Therefore, mademoiselle, after the game tomorrow, I would be honored if you would accompany me to the prom. Mr. Marlowe, you are a pain in the neck in any language. I'm going to the prom with Mr. Van Dyne. You may be able to memorize lines, but you can't memorize good manners. Okay, Ms. McClellan. Maybe it took a ton of bricks to fall on me, but I guess I get the idea. You win. I, uh, I won't take up anymore of your valuable time. Look, Pat, you keep treating Tommy like that, and he might lose the game for Tait tomorrow. I'm afraid Mr. Marlowe's career just doesn't interest me. Watch this. I'll get her interested. Leave Pat alone, kids. Just because he's our college hero, she doesn't have to throw herself at his feet. - That's right. - And I don't blame her. After all, what'll he be when he gets through college? The Pickle King of America! - The what? Oh, didn't you know? His father's the Marlowe Pickle Works. How sordid. Pickles. - Yeah, $30 million worth. Wow! Isn't it disgusting? And still, poor Tommy has no one to go to the dance with. All that dough, most popular guy in school, no date. Maybe you're betting on the wrong horse, Pat. I'll thank you to mind your own business.

I was on my way to your office, I've corrected those test papers, I might as well give them to you now. Oh, thank you, my dear. Oh, yes. The elementary class. Why, that was a fast job. - Oh, excuse me. - Well! Gee, Connie, it's good to see you. Oh, excuse me, professor. I... Marlowe, you ought to watch your step in more ways than one. I've got your first exam paper right here. How did our football star do, Ms. Lane? Oh, a perfect paper. One hundred percent. - I did? - Well, I'm surprised. Well, just don't get careless now, you've got to tow the mark with me. Football and studies don't mix. You know? Good day. He's a pleasant old cuss, isn't he? Well, I, uh, I got to go to football practice. Gee, I got a perfect paper. You know why though? It was all your work. It's just a vocabulary test, mostly words you taught me that day. Yes, I know. You know, it isn't half as much fun when Kennyon teaches it. I never have the least impulse to kiss him. Speaking of your impulses, how about Pat McClellan? Are you making a dent on her with your French? No. Oh, here, I'll take these. Guess I should have used that hockey stick. But that doesn't matter anymore. I knew that the second I bumped into you just now. I tell you, I just don't care, I don't care if I never see her again in my life. In fact, will you go to the prom with me tomorrow night? After she turned you down? No, thanks. But that's what I'm trying to tell you, I'm glad she did, because now I can ask you. Play second fiddle? No, thanks. Guess I don't blame you. Well, who are you gonna ask now? Nobody. I'm not gonna go stag. - Guess I won't go at all. - Not go to the prom? - No. - Oh, but that's silly! It'll practically be in your honor. I'll go if you'll go with me. Well... Alright. You will? Oh, that's wonderful! I'll pick you at eight o'clock. I'm late now for practice. - Goodbye. - Good luck in the game. Oh, they sure are blue. Look at Connie. - Uh-oh. Hi, Connie! - She's acting so strange. Connie, hello! Connie! Hello. Hi. So I told her if that's what she.. Hello, Connie. Hi. - Ms. Connie! - Yes? The sink, it's acting up again. - It is? How nice. - How do you like that? - Connie? - She must've gone crazy. Overwork. She's having a breakdown, poor kid. I gotta do something! Connie, are you alright? - Babe, guess what? - What? I'm going to the prom tomorrow night. So that's it. How wonderful! Who are you going with? - You'll never guess. - Alright. - Then you'd better tell me. - Oh... I know it seems impossible, but... he likes me. - Who? - Tommy. - Tommy Marlowe. - Tommy! Oh. Uh, look, Connie, I think I ought to warn you. - Pat's... - Oh, Pat! He told me all about that. - It's all over. - Are you sure? Oh, of course, I'm sure. Don't spoil my fun, Babe. What do you think I should wear? A suit of armor. Oh. Just think, I'm going out with a football hero. Yay, Marlowe! Come on, Marlowe! Touchdown! Tsk. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Hi! Oh, Tommy, I was so thrilled! You made a football fan out of me overnight. Oh, Tommy, I was so mistaken about you. But then today when I saw you out on the field, I suddenly realized that maybe I was so rude to you because I really liked you. But I didn't wanna let myself like you as much as I could like you if I really let myself. Gee, Pat, this is so crazy. It's so wonderful! - I don't know what to say. - I know what to say. Can I go with you to the prom tonight? What? Can you? Oh, this is terrific! Oh, wait a minute. - What about Van Dyne? - Oh, he just doesn't matter. Poor Peter, he's really so stuffy. Oh, I should've known the minute you saw me play a game. Gee, this is so wonderful. This is the greatest day of my life! I win the opening game and you at the same time.

Hey, Babe, you ready? - Connie, I won't go. - I'll stay here with you. - Oh, that's sweet. But it wouldn't help either... either one of us. Well, look, Connie, there must be a way of fixing this. - I'll try. - No, don't. Don't try to fix anything. I don't want him anymore. You have a good time. Well, what'll you do?

Why, he never got those kind of marks before. He hasn't been studying, coach, this McClellan dame is leading him around by the noose. - Well, he just about made it. - Oh, yeah? - Where's the French marks? - They're not posted yet, coach. Hey, coach. I passed in everything. Guess I'll play that big game Saturday, huh? Beef, you're a genius, now all we have to do is worry about Tommy. Where is he? Hey, Babe, you passed everything! - I did? - Yes. Whoo-pee! Bobby! Bobby, I told you last night I'd pass. Hey, did you see him last night? Uh, here comes Tommy. Well, kids, here I is. Hi. - Darling, it's here I am. - It's only a slang expression. But, darling, I don't like when you speak bad grammar. Okay, darling. Hi, coach. Hello, Poochie. Hello, darling. Well, do I play the big game Saturday? Yeah, yeah. You passed everything, Tommy. - But.. - What do you mean but? The French marks aren't up yet. Oh, now, coach. You're not gonna worry about that. My best subject. Why, Saturday's gonna be my big day. We're gonna take Colton and mop up the field with him. - I hope so. - And don't forget, Tommy. Saturday's a big day for another reason, too. - Huh? - Don't you remember? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - Well, shall we tell everybody? Yes. Yes, why not? Well, listen, everybody. Saturday after Tommy wins the big game.. - Oh, you tell them, Tommy. - Okay. Uh, all I wanted to say, kids, was that, uh, after the big game with Colton Saturday... Pat and I are gonna announce our engagement. - Engagement? - Congratulations, Tommy. - Holy mackerel! - What is it? Oh, no! - They can't do this to me. - Can't? They did. Well, that's that. What do you mean, that's that? We've gotta do something. You're gonna play that game Saturday. Uh, I know. The dean! Come in. Ms. Lane, the dean and Professor Kennyon have decided to give Marlowe a re-examination in French tomorrow afternoon. - Yeah. - How nice for him. Well, when can you start coaching him? - Me? - Sure. Yes, you, Marlowe says you're the best. Tell Mr. Marlowe I thank him for the compliment, but I'm much too busy. Tell him to ask Ms. McClellan. - She says... - Connie, Connie, I... I don't want them to bother you. Pat spoke in French since she was a child, but she's not up on her grammar, and I- Tell Mr. Marlowe, quel fromage. - What? - Listen, Ms. Lane. I don't care what you think about Marlowe personally, but that game next Saturday is a dead duck without him. I don't really care whether Mr. Marlowe plays or not. You mean you'd lose the game for the school? That's treason, you're building the foundations of a lifetime guilt complex! Connie, baby, I know how you feel, but you've no choice. - It's for dear old Tait! - You gotta do something. - Alright, for dear old Tait. - Oh, wonderful. Tell Mr. Marlowe I'll meet him at the sorority house at eight o'clock, in the kitchen. Gee, thanks, Connie. Now name the verbs that take etre instead of avoir. Aller, tomber, sortir, partir, venir... Oh, I... I can't think of anymore. That's hardly the right attitude, Mr. Marlowe. - You have an exam to pass. - Yeah, yeah, I know. Look, Professor Kennyon is devoting his time to giving you this chance. And I'm giving up my time. The least you can do is concentrate. I... I keep thinking of so many other things. Connie, won't you even talk to me? You were doing splendidly with those verbs, Mr. Marlowe. Would you try them again, please? Okay.

Gee, it's funny to think about being engaged. Wonder what it's like to be stuck with one person for life. Well, if it were the right person, you wouldn't consider yourself stuck. Oh, well, I didn't exactly mean stuck. I.. I mean, well.. Do you ever think about yourself after college? - Settled down and married? - Of course, I.. I guess every girl has a pretty good idea of what she wants. Yeah? What do you want? Oh, I guess I'd like to have a family to bring up and be able to go to concerts and theaters, balcony seats. And have people over to the house, a nice little house. - A vine-covered cottage, maybe? - Or an apartment. I... I guess the important thing is finding the right fellow. It sounds pretty dull to you, doesn't it? No. No, it sounds wonderful. What do you want? - Well, I guess I... Pat. - Hello. Just dropped in to see how the lesson is progressing. The patient will live. I didn't know a French lesson included singing love songs. You were listening. Oh, I, I heard Tommy's voice, and I naturally thought he was singing for me. I need hardly remind you that we're practically engaged. Making a play for a practically engaged man is a very unladylike thing to do. So is listening at keyholes. - Why, you... - Oh, don't worry, Pat. Tomorrow Tommy will get every one of those answers right because he loves you. Even if he didn't, I wouldn't want him. I wouldn't want him if he were the last man on the campus. Oh, you picked the perfect mate for yourself. He's inconsiderate, vain, selfish, and, and you can't believe a word he says. And the same goes for you. You deserve to be stuck with each other. Congratulations! I know you'll both be very happy. - Connie. - I wonder where Connie.. - Connie? - What's going on? Let us know. - Well, do you wanna correct it? Oh, he passed, alright. It's almost silly to look. Well, we'll see. Well, what is this? Some kind of a joke? - What? - Well, listen to this. "Name the French verbs that take etre." Answer, "Hit her over the head with a hockey stick." - What? - Question. "Give the French word for ten objects in the room." Answer, "The best things in life are free." Go ahead. "Write a short composition in French describing your home." He's answered it in English. "My home is a vine-covered apartment with people in the balcony and 12 children." - Oh, that's wonderful! - Wonderful? Oh, professor, do you know what this means? I certainly do not. - It means he loves me. - What? - He loves me. - What are you talking about? Oh, he knows his French, he could've passed, but he wanted to flunk, so he did it on purpose. - Don't you see? - No, I don't see. He didn't wanna pass because he didn't wanna play because he didn't wanna be engaged to Pat. You mean, he loves you so much, he'd even lose the game for the school? Yes! - And I love him, too. - Just a minute, Connie. You, you tell me this boy really knows his French? Well, he knows it cold. I've certainly got to admire him. He's, he made a big sacrifice giving up something that must mean a good deal to him, winning that game tomorrow. It means a good deal to the school, too. - Well, yes, I know, but... - As you are aware... I'm not the school's greatest football enthusiast, but under the circumstances, I... - I think I ought to pass him. - Pass him? Now, you'd feel pretty guilty if he didn't play in that game tomorrow, wouldn't you? But if he wins, then Pat's got him. Connie, you'll have to work out your personal problems without involving the whole school. I'm afraid you'll have to find some other way. Well, I hate to say it, but I guess you're right. Well, I'll, I'll leave it up to you. Shall I pass him? Hey, Connie! Did he pass? Yeah, yeah. Did he pass? Oh, come on. Let us know about it. Hey, what's the score? Hey, we got to play a game. Let us know, Connie. - Here she comes now. - Hey. Um, after carefully considering Mr. Marlowe's unusual examination paper, and being somewhat surprised at the, uh, rather remarkable answers to some of the questions, Professor Kennyon has decided that... Well, he's interested, and, uh, uh, though he doesn't approve of some of the, uh, phrasing used, he feels that Mr. Marlowe has demonstrated a, a real feeling for the language. - Well, what is it? Yeah. What is it, Connie? What, what happened? He passed. ♪ Marlowe showed them a thing or two ♪ ♪ He's a ladies' man ♪ ♪ He's a wow with the parlez-vous ♪ ♪ So Marlowe big man on the campus ♪ ♪ Marlowe it's all up to you to come through ♪♪ Number 16, pass. - Hike. - Touchdown. Touchdown. Touchdown. Touchdown. What does that lug Marlowe think he's doing out there? - Playing tiddlywinks? - Oh. He certainly isn't trying very hard to win. Trying to win? He's the best man Colton has! Isn't his little woman here to spur him on to glory? No, Pat's at the house fixing her prom dress. I suppose she figures the game's in the bag. Beef, are you hurt? Take a breath. - That hurt? - A little. Well, doc, just how bad is it? Can't tell until we take an X-ray. When you're finished dressing, come over to the infirmary. We'd better finish the game in the infirmary. - But, you see, I didn't... - Take it easy. Save your strength. We may need you for the Maypole dance next spring. You're all invited. That's right, laugh. Everybody, enjoy yourselves. Popcorn, Cracker Jacks! Champagne for everyone! Alright! I suppose you guys thought I'd come in here and bawl the living daylights out of you. Scream, rant, lose my mind! Uh... But nothing like that's gonna happen. I'm perfectly calm. I'm not gonna let a little old football game upset me! I could go through the whole lot of you and tell you What you've done wrong, but you know what you did. Zubrowski, that end run. Hepple! Hepple, where were you? Sternsdorf, offside three times. Fifteen yards! Uh, Thompson. Thompson, haven't you heard? The forward pass has been legal for 15 years. Okay! What's the use? Of course, I know the one thing that's really wrong. Marlowe, you're not playing at all. If you'd get in there and play, they'd all play with you. - What's eating you, Tommy? - Nothing, coach. - I'm alright. - "Alright?" You're so alright, you're gonna spend the rest of the game sitting on the bench. - Oh, coach. - That's final! Alright. Ha! If you're alright, then I'm crazy. And I'll prove it to you. Turner. Turner, come here. Me, sir? Turner, our two best players are out of the game. So I thought it would be an interesting form of suicide to put you in. - Oh, no. - No, coach! Gee, that's great, coach. I'll kill 'em. I'll kill 'em! I'll tear 'em apart. I'll show 'em. For dear old Tait, I'll do or die! What spirit! Look at that, fellows. There's inspiration for ya. New blood in the game. That good old Tait spirit. And no one can beat him. You're not gonna let all those people down. Not all those people out there! Not all those little old ladies who sweep up the stadium. I mean... That's it! Bobby! Bobby, my boy. Fellas, get up off your benches and get in there and fight! You lucky dog. I wish I had a broken rib. Tommy, you shouldn't say that. You still got a chance to win. - Win what? The game? - Sure. And Pat, too. Don't you wanna announce your engagement to her? Not when I'm in love with Connie. Connie? - Connie! Beef! - Here we are. - Excuse me. - Are you alright? - Yeah. I'm gonna be X-rayed. - Down in front. - Listen, Connie. You got to do something. You can't just sit here. - Tommy's losing the game! - But what can I do about it? He just told me that if he wins, he gets the wrong girl because he loves you! - Aw, sit down! - Oh. You mean Tommy really loves Connie? Yeah, and she's gotta go out there and give him a pep talk. Oh, but if I do, then I'll lose him forever. Holy smoke! You mean it's true? - Uh-huh. - Then we gotta do something. You love him, he loves you. We've gotta get rid of Pat. Why did I ever tell her Tommy was the Pickle King? Pickle King? Beef, have you got your brother-in-law's car here? - Sure. Have you seen it? - Oh, no. But I'd love to. - Hey! - Oh, we're going. You going down to talk to Tommy? No, I'm going to the house. I'll see you later, Babe. - Come on. - But my X-ray. Yes! - Faster. - But I don't understand. Oh, please, Beef, I've got to concentrate. There. Now you wait here, Beef. And if someone comes out before I do, give her a lift, will ya? Alright, Connie, but I don't understand. You will. - Cora. - Oh, Ms. Connie. I'm so glad you're back. You know... Never mind that now. You've got to help me. - Have you ever acted in a play? - What? Oh. I mean, have you ever recited lines like, um, Sarah Bernhardt or Ethel Barrymore? You know? - Oh, you mean play-acting? - Yes. Come on. Oh. Wait a minute. Look, now I've written it all down here. And don't you talk till we get there. Shh. Oh! Oh, Cora, I'm so unhappy. Oh, Cora, I had to come back from the game. I couldn't stand it anymore. It's so awful. We're winning! Tommy is piling up touchdown after touchdown. And by tonight he'll be engaged to that awful Pat McClellan. I hate her! "Now, now, Ms. Connie, you better forget all about it." "He loves her and that's all there is to it." Oh, I can't stand it! She's got him for life. "Does she love him?" - Oh, I suppose she does. After all, she stuck by him even through what just happened. - "Through what just happened?" - "Haven't you heard?" "Tommy's father, the Pickle King, he's gone bankrupt." "Really?" "Yes." "A terrible cucumber blight in Iowa." "He's a ruined man. Tommy is penniless!" Um, uh... "No!" "Well, I guess Pat won't mind." "She'll be glad to scrimp and scrub and save and sew 'cause she'll have him." "After all, when you have love, money doesn't really matter, does it, Cora?" "Does it, Cora?" I mean, uh, I mean, uh... "She could, uh, clear 15, or, uh, 20 taking in washing." "Oh, but she has such pretty hands." "Oh, well, it's her problem now." "Oh, Cora!" - "Poor child." "Why don't you go back to the game?" "No, I can't watch anymore. Beef drove me over." "He's outside now." "He's been paying a lot of attention to me ever since... Babe gave him back his fraternity pin." "But I guess I love Tommy too much." "Beef... B... Beef is a very fine fellow, no." "Oh, a girl could do worse." "Just think, he's one of the richest boys at Tait." "Dairy products, you know, worth millions!" "Have you seen that new car of his?" "Oh, my, it is a wow. Yes." Oh. "Just think, such a catch, and completely unattached." "Maybe I'd better hold on to him before someone else gets there." - Was it alright? - Marvelous! Gee, why must everyone get literary in my car? Oh, please forgive me, Beef. This is very important. You will forgive me, won't you? Gee, I'd forgive you anything. Ready. Hike. Hey, Tommy, I got something for you. "Can't stand in the way of true love." "Make big sacrifice. Give you up. Pat." Hey, Beef! This is it! Hey! Thanks. Hey, coach! Coach, I'm alright now. - Let me go in. - Marlowe, I can't figure it. We got three minutes. Go ahead. Alright, 32 is our only chance. - Bobby, you know the play? - Yeah. Okay, hike. Oh, Tommy, we've been looking for you. Where have you been? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Anyone seen Connie? - No. - Well, I gotta go. - Thank you. - Tommy! So we're on the 40-yard line, and I've got the ball. - Hey! Hey! - So I turn around.. I got squatter's rights! - Shoo. Shoo. - Alright, break it up, girls. Come here, woman, and kiss me. Where's Beef? I want to show him I'm not afraid of him. Hey, Beef! Are you looking? Gee, I used to think I had a mother fixation. You're not a bit like her. I like you better. Oh, Beefy, you're a panic. Do you think he's here, professor? - Of course he is. - Hello. Guess I can't understand why he didn't call me. Don't forget, he's still under the impression that you don't like him. I'm sure... That after you're in there for five minutes, you'll be in each others' arms. - Really? - Uh, check, please. Oh, Van Dyne. Would you take Ms. Lane inside? I left my pipe. Hah. - I'd be delighted. - Thank you, Peter. You just look adorable tonight. Oh. Why, Peter. Van Dyne! Who'd you expect her to come with, Professor Kennyon? Oh, I don't know what to expect. I'm going home. - Marlowe. - Yes, sir? - Where are you rushing off to? - I'm going home, sir. - Why, isn't it a bit early? - Yes, sir. I don't think you should leave so soon. I think there's someone inside looking for you. - Who? - Connie Lane, to be exact. I think you're mistaken, sir. She can't stand the sight of me. - So you're going home? - Yes, sir. You're just leaving? Sinking away like Napoleon from Waterloo. Did you speak to her? You didn't even speak to her? For Pete's sake, Marlowe, what's the matter with you? You don't do this in the football field. When you think it's a losing battle, you try harder. Now you mustn't give up. How do you know she doesn't love you? You've got to, uh, you've got to... What is it your coach always says to you? You've got to, you've got to, uh... - Get in there? - Yes! Get in there and fight. - Good luck. - Yes, sir. Connie! Connie? Oh, it's you. I thought you'd left. - Well, how'd you know? - Somebody told me. Well, I almost left. What stopped you? Nothing stopped me. I'm leaving now. Well... where are you going? Where am I going? I'm going home! Where do people generally go? Home. You staying? Oh, yes. I'm having a lovely time. Well, why don't you go back inside? I like it out here. I think it's utterly delightful out here. And besides, no one's gonna tell me where to go! - Why don't you go inside? - I'm leaving. I don't have to go inside. Well, then why don't you leave? Because I love you! Oh. That's a ridiculous thing to say. Well, I said it. - I'm glad. - What? I'm glad! - Oh, you are? - Yes. Oh, well, in that case, I got a lot of things to say. For instance? You remember the day in the library when you gave me the French lesson? Well, there are a lot of things that you could teach me and that's the way I want it to be. You name it. I... I'll do anything you say. - Anything? - Try me. Well.. - Down on your heels. - Down on my heels? - Up on your toes. - Up on my toes?
