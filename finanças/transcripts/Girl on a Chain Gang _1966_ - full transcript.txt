(rhythmic music) (thunder cracking) ♪ We're three little lambs who have lost our way ♪ ♪ Baa, baa, baa ♪ (all laughing) - Hey Luke, Luke. - Huh? Keep these cold. (siren wailing) Y'all get outta there. Get out of there. Quick now! What are y'all tryin' to do? Resist arrest? Let 'em out, Luke, let's see what they look like. (suspenseful percussion music) Welcome to Carson's Landing. Now we're mighty pleased you all come to visit our fair town. Our fair town. There's an old sayin'. Two's company, three's a crowd. Yeah. Crowd a carpet, bag and scum. (chuckles) Integrated scum. (Chuckles) (policemen laughing) Hey, boy! You got dirty shoes. Don't you know how to dress? Why, just look at them shoes. You one of them, uh, beatniks or somethin'? Now what's the matter, boy? Cat got your tongue? You mean you can't talk either? Now hold on, boy! Now you talk only when I ask you a question! Now you in Carson's Landing now. Down here we got a thing called manners. So you talk, only when you're spoken to! Now uh, don't get yourself all riled up, Luke. Park from a face show. It's obvious these people here ain't educated to the rules of the road, and we gotta educate 'em. And we gotta educate 'em. Yeah, they're just a little bit dumb, that's all. You're educated, ain't ya? Well now you tell your bosom buddy there, that's drivin' this rig, what the speed limit is on this here public road. But I can assure you we weren't going faster than any other car on the road. No else was goin'. Talkin' about you. And that's all. Yeah well, maybe these other people, they had some place real important to go. You ain't in no hurry. Well what's the matter, little lady, you tired already? Now get back there, boy. Simmer down, everybody! See what you got in here, now. Now we wouldn't wanna give the coroner any extra work. Now we wouldn't wanna give the coroner any extra work. Age 21. Height five foot six. Weight 115 pounds. White female American. Free, white and 21. You mighty fine lookin' woman, Miss Jean Rollins. You shouldn't be travelin' these treacherous roads, There's no tellin' what might happen to ya. Now, you listen! If we did something wrong, you're gonna have to follow the correct legal procedure and have us charged. If we're innocent, let us go. Okay, big man, you're gonna be charged. Now all three of you get in that car! Get in there! Wait a minute. You two get in the car. Little lady will come along with us, just for safe keepin'. Now get in there! Want you to pull out real slow, and boy you better turn right, too. 'Cause as of this minute, you can consider yourselves under arrest. And I wouldn't wanna have to shoot myself any, uh, escapin' prisoners. And remember, you people took to comin' down here, so you'd better take to playin' by our rules. Let's go. (siren wailing) [Luke] Come on, get in there. Move, get in there! Move! What have we here, men? Reckless drivin'. Passin' on the inside lane. Ridin' with worn out treads. Talkin' back to an officer. Arrest. And uh, disruptin' uh, the morals of the populace. That's all? Well now, we didn't wanna put everything down. Lest we make 'em seem like eh, hardened criminals. Now let me tell you a thing or two, huh? Everybody knows his place. And nobody's out of line. There was a time back, when people got nosy. They were from the state highway police. Now we don't cotton to no interference in local matters. But I don't think those boys made much of a report. Seems about a year later somebody found a couple of belt buckles down in Possumin swamp. (Chuckles) They get themselves a real juicy meal. Speakin' of juicy morsels. What's a nice-lookin' girl like you doin' with black and white trash like this? It's a good thing that this fair community, got good strong boys like us here to protect them from temptation. An atheist, huh? People cause us trouble in the south- - Now, for the last time, I'm going to try to explain to you that we're not uneducated. I've got my Masters degree for social sciences from Yale. I'm studying for my doctorate. Mr. Dickson, my associate is a graduate from Monstro. State Teachers College. Miss Rollins is doing her post-graduate work (clapping) (Luke laughs) Graduated kindergarten. Easy, Sonny Lew, easy. Don't let your temper get the best of ya! Luke's right, Sonny Lew. You remember what happened the time before. [Luke] Sure enough, Sonny Lew, you can't keep saying you beat a man to death with your fists for trying to escape. It's all right! [Luke] Now there'd be an investigation after a while. Get away, I'm okay. Now you watch yourself, Sheriff. I know our rights! I think you're aware of legal procedure to that extent, You certainly have no right to physically abuse us. [Sonny Lew] Let me get back to my filing desk, so I can see how much you owe me, huh? I mean, the county. If you can't pay your fine, you gotta spend a mighty long vacation in that back cell. Well accordin' to the new law passed by the town legislature, in the car. 147, plus $3 for the county fine collecting fee. (chuckles) What do you know? Comes to exactly $150. Now my guess is, business has been bad. You people don't have that kind of money. Looks like to me, what's gonna happen to you, Looks like to me, what's gonna happen to you, gotta lock you up. Let me count. How are you fixed for cash? I hope they didn't take my wallet. - (You people never saw {mumbles) - at one time in your life. Here we are. $150. Step over in this direction, folks. That was a mere formality. I'd like you all to display your remaining cash, 'cause if you don't have any, there's a law in my town against vagrancy. Yeah. You ain't broke that law, huh? You ain't broke that law, huh? Now sit (mumbles) Gonna give ya some mighty good information. Now listen, girl. Shouldn't act that way. I'm just gonna give you a piece of advice. It's a little crime called, prostitution. In other words, I don't want you asking in my town. How dare you! Sit down, boys. Now I'd hate to start somethin', no? There ain't nothin' that me, or my deputies can stop it. As for you two gentlemen, have you ever heard of the Mann Act? Hm? Huh? I'm sure you know what it says. Oh, education. You ought to. Just refresh your memory. It concerns the sale or the transporting of a woman across state lines for immoral purposes. How much more of this do we have to listen to? Now look here, boy, you listen as long as I want you to. I'm gonna let you go now. But I'm warning ya. One false move. And I'll put you in them cells out back. And I'll put you in them cells out back. Now get outta here. [Cal] Pretty fine, huh, Sonny Lew? I wouldn't touch a woman that sinful if she come runnin' in here naked, boy. (suspenseful music) Can you beat that? Couple of dumb hick cops pushing us around. I don't want you to let them three out of your sight. See where they go, what they do. I want a hell of an example of the free love society found to be viewed by an impressionable southern girl. Alright, get out back. That's where they're pickin' up their car, huh? Right. That Sheriff is quite a character. Smelled like a distillery. No, don't let that fool you. They're smart enough to stay within the law. We have to be very careful. If they found out we were down here to help in voter registration, we'd very likely disappear without a trace. No good all of "em. Yeah! Yeah! Thinkin' they can come down here and change everything. You don't see hone of us goin' up there and tryin' to change them. They ain't got no good reason for bein' down here. Just wait. (suspenseful music) Claude, boy, let me tell you about a little old gal I had last night. She was what you might call poor white trash. Yeah, go on. Well, buddy. I never had such a fight in all my life. I had to practically rape her before she'd give me some. But it was sure worth the trouble. (Laughs) Les, the way business has been these days, I'd serve an entire chain gang of black men. Uh, three scotch and sodas, please. That'll be $3.75. Somethin' wrong? How much did these drinks cost you? Oh, regular price, forget about it. Beats making your own. Remember in chemistry class? Yeah, we had our own little still. 100 proof and old professor Camajan never suspected a thing. Here's to our friendly welcome. Yeah. Hey, you know there ain't no law in this county. Hey, you know there ain't no law in this county against drinkin', so how we gonna arrest 'em? Cal, this is the most perfect thing - could have happened, boy. - What do you mean? Now you listen to this. But you know, I never did learn how to pronounce his name. He was a real funny bird, the way he dressed and all. Yeah but he gave me a B+ and that was a big surprise. Yes, sir. For you, Les. Hello, Les? How are ya, boy? Yeah! This is Deputy Luke. Mm-hm. And I'm callin' on uh, official business. Now we've got somethin' mighty important we need you to do. So how you listen to me real careful now. Sure, Luke. Uh-huh. Don't you worry about a thing, boy, Mm-hm. Yeah, yeah sure. Mm-hm. I'll be right back, Claude. Just gonna stick my head out the door and get me a bit of fresh air. What's that? What's that? Now you just listen to me, boy. I'm a happily married man! Claude here runs a respectable place. And sell her somewhere else! Did you ever hear the likes of that, Claude? Askin' me, Les Davis, to be unfaithful of my woman for a tramp like that! I'd throw 'em the hell outta here! First time anything's ever happened in here like that, Les. I'm real sorry they offended you. Some people sure got a nerve approaching a man so outspoken like that. They oughta be whipped and punished with a cat of nine tails, all three of them! Especially that girl. Especially that girl. Cal and me are just stoppin' by for a routine check, And I'll be damned over what I just happened to hear said from in here. Is it true what that white boy asked you, Les? Well now, Luke. I wouldn't want to see anyone get into trouble. I was, what you might call, propositioned, I guess. And it's a damn shame, a family man like me, not able to enjoy a social- - Okay Les, that's enough. Come on, you three, back we go. You'll uh, sign a statement to the effect of what happened. Don't you forget what you promised back then. Now you come along with us now, and we'll be able to take care of the statement, and everything else that's due. You too, Claude. Come on. Now you're sure you didn't do anything to provoke this proposition, as you call? Now you know me better than that, Sheriff. Yeah. You're a real law-abiding citizen, Les. And this white fellow over here called, Ted Branch, direct as daylight asked you to accept the favors of this young woman, Miss Jean Rollins. The other boy, Artie Dickson. Didn't offer any objections, You expected something like that when they came in the bar because the way they looked around, like, lookin' for prospects for their dirty deal? That's just the way it happened, Sheriff. Mm-hm. Luke. Anyone see these three being arrested? Why no, Sonny Lew. Only other one in the bar was old Zeke Landers, and he was stoned like a mackerel. Then of course there was Claude, he was uh, tendin' bar as usual. Zeke's a chronic alcoholic. His word ain't no good in court. Claude here's okay, he'll be the witness. You'll testify, won't you, Claude? Testify? Yeah, I mean, back up the legitimacy of the arrest. I'll testify. Listen um, about Les, he's a pretty heavy drinker. If we put him on the stand, he's gonna throw every- - Les has been a witness before, huh? Take me take care of this, okay? Okay. Well wouldn't you just know it, huh? You ain't gone out of here more than one hour and here you are right back again. Can't take a fair word of warnin'. I thought I explained it pretty clear to your three. You should have kept right on goin', but you couldn't help stoppin' off in that bar. Well that's gonna be the sorriest stoppin' off you ever did. Just lookin' for trouble. Well this time you've bit off more than you can chew. The power of lust is more than you can take, and you can take. You're just like animals, no self control! Cal, lock these three up. [Sonny Lew] Oh and Luke! Put that young lady in a cell all to herself. (chuckles) Yeah. All right, boys, there'll be a few questions coming up. I want you to go home now and do mighty high studyin', huh? Now listen, Sonny Lew. I didn't know it was gonna involve all this. I just thought it- You listen to me. If you do like I say, ain't goin' back to sharecroppin' and $2 a day. I only took you out of there 'cause you're married to a cousin of mine and I gotta kind out for my kin. Could just as easy put you back out there, Les. That hot boilin' sun with your little friends. That hot boilin' sun with your little friends. You wanna go back to that? Well? I'll take the paper. Read them all. Have the boys come round tomorrow, take off. You too, Claude. Everybody's put away, I got her off by her lonesome. There ain't gonna be no trouble tonight. Everything's real peaceful like. It's gonna be peaceful like again. A little rottin' in jail never hurt no one. You boys can go now. Where you headed? Huh? Oh, uh. Uh, we're goin' uh, back down behind the billboard to uh, patrol for more of them speeders. I never known any public official to go back to the job when you don't have to. You couldn't have a little surprise down there, could ya? Like a light-skinned bundle of goodies? Okay. Don't forget to have yourself a real good time, huh? You did a real good job, boys. You deserve some fancy relaxation. When your tour of duty is over, you come back with Nellie, huh? I have sort of an idea that might come in handy. Why sure, Sonny Lew. I mean, that is if we happen to run into her. Yeah. [Ted] Leave her alone! (shouting over each other) (Jean screams) (Sonny Lew chuckles) Jean! (door knock) If that's you, use your key and if it ain't, Hey, Sonny Lew. We uh, brung back Nellie like you asked. What'd you want her for? She's kindly puckered out now. Hey, what happened to you? You look you've been in some kind of fight. That little tramp. She got me to let her out of her cell. Said she wanted to circulate her cramped legs. I know I normally don't do that for a prisoner, but I got some respect for womanhood no matter what she must have done. Then she tried to make a rush for the door. Out of the black one in the back before the trial. It'd make things a lot easier for them to go on. [Luke] What kind of trial, Sonny Lew? Well I ain't told you boys yet, but we're havin' ourselves a little trial in the mornin... We all know you control the county. Why are you even botherin' with a trial at all? Trials ain't no good, what if outsiders should stick their noses in? It might end up a debated affair. And expose certain things and- - Sometimes you make a lot of sense. But somethin' just might happen to them boys. [Luke] Yeah. They might just pick up on it. A lot of desperate men might have real good reason to escape. Yeah. And people have gotten mighty hurt tryin' to escape. [Luke] Exactly. I wonder if they're just dumb enough to try that. But Nellie here gotta get us a confession first, it's for insurance, we gotta have a trial for the record, just in case anybody comes pokin' their noses around afterwards, it's got to be all legal and proper. How about it, Nellie? You ready to do me a favor? Well Sheriff, you know I'm always ready to work with you or your men, but it's getting onto what might call overtime now. I know, Nellie. And I'm quite ready to see to it that your maw, she gets electricity so she can run her washing machine. After all, ain't young without a paw, must bring somebody a hardship. [Nellie] Sonny Lew, my ma ain't never gonna get to see that power line come to her shack and you know it. Now I don't mean no disrespect, but $5 paid whether or not I get the confession I find much more promising. $5? $5. Plus I get to see you again when this is all over, huh? Thank you, Sheriff, now where you hidin' that nice colored boy that's supposed to do the signin'? Now this is a confession. He's gotta sign the line at the bottom. You boys stay out here. There's no sense in startin' any commotion. There's no sense in startin' any commotion. I just wanna make sure you're around, to have a nice fair trial in the morning. Come here, boy, you got a visitor. What do you mean a trial in the morning? [Jean] Oh Ted, be careful. Now just a minute, Sheriff. According to you we committed a federal offense. So how can you make provisions for a trial so quickly? You haven't even held an arraignment or made an indictment against us. I'm gonna try you myself and sentence you myself. You're not empowered to conduct a federal court! You're not empowered to conduct a federal court! You can't get away with this! We have friends who'll investigate if anything happens to us. You can't be judge and jury all by yourself! I'm the law here. But don't you worry, boys. You're gonna get a real fair trial. And if you're guilty, as I guess you are, then the court will be merciful. Don't get me wrong, (chuckles) I like you boys. (chuckles) All right. I'm gonna open this cell now and I want you to come out real easy like, hm? Come on, boy! It ain't polite to keep visitors waitin'! Alright Nellie, he's all yours. Now all I wanna hear is talkin', you hear? (Chuckles) You better listen to Nellie there, boy. She's your current somewhat, she can save your neck. I can't believe you're here to help me. You can trust me, Artie. What I have to say to you could save you. What have I done to be saved from? It makes no difference now and you should know that. You'll probably die unless you sign a confession. Die? You must be kidding. Quiet serious, Artie. There's a lot of good things around in life to miss if you die. There's no sense to die when you don't have to. I guess that man could kill me, or anyone else without having to have a reason. What does that promise mean? Well, how about that. A form letter confession. And all the guilty party has to do is fill in the nature of their crime and sign it. Tell me, girl, how many times have you been under the Sheriff? Now, what difference could that make? Now, what difference could that make? The important thing is the confession will save your life. Better straighten out that paper and sign it, Sheriff! Open this door and get her out of here! Do anything you like with me but remove your carnal offerings! What's the matter, flag boy, you too good for her, huh? I am, besides that, I don't play your kind of games. (punch thuds) I heard what you asked her. (Chuckles) Sure I've had her, many times over, but you, you're too good for her, huh? You think you're better than me? Now you look at her. Now you look at her. That's a real woman there. (thuds) (groans) (groans) Okay, that's enough! That's enough, throw him back in the other cell. Artie! Artie! When you threw that confession away, I'm gonna leave you alone now, Don't bother with me. I'm all right. Just shook up a bit. How's Jean? Did they- - No, I don't think so. Jean. The door! I pushed it open. You pushed it open? You know, Luke, I lied to them people when I told 'em that they used up their last chance, huh? Used up their last chance, huh? (chuckles) What happened? Ted, Artie! Is anything the matter? I just put my hand on the door and it opened. What do you think, Artie? I don't know. It sounds too bad. What if it's a trap? So long, boys. See you in the mornin'. It's our only chance, Artie. And that Sheriff, he doesn't intend to let us walk out of here alive. Why would he be bothering with a kangaroo trial? Now look, there's one window on each side of that front door. They face the sidewalk. Now I also noticed there aren't any bars on those windows. Now as soon as things sound quiet out there, we'll both run through that first door and throw ourselves through those windows. Now if anyone is sitting in that office, they'll be completely surprised. So, I'll take the right window and you take the one on the left. - Okay? - Sounds good. Heck, it might really work. Don't worry, it'll work. It has to. But what about Jean? We can't leave her here. [Ted] What can we do? They didn't go near her cell. She'll understand, I'll explain it to her later. (suspenseful music) Oh Ted, Artie, I'm frightened to death. But we're pretty sure that the Sheriff was as drunk and as excited as he appeared, and he just forgot to lock our cell. Sure, Jean, it could be a trap, but we can't wait around for a trial. You know we'd be found guilty, and then what? You heard what that girl Nellie said. Now, don't worry. As soon as we get out we'll go to the state police barracks. We'll be safe there. They'll hear our story and put an end to Sheriff Wymer and his deputies and you'll be free again. I'll be praying for you both. Please be careful and don't worry about me. Get away, you sons of bitches. [Luke] But Sonny Lew, you was supposed to take him down! You told us to take the colored boy and leave the white one to you! Get the hounds, get the hounds! Hold on, Sonny Lew, I think I found somethin'. Looks like we don't need them hounds. This boy left a trail for us to follow. His blood runnin... Yeah and there's a whole lot more of it on the ground here by them bits of broken glass. It trails off in this direction. He's headed for the woods. (Laughs) (suspenseful music) (energetic music) (policemen chuckle) Leg looks somethin' bad. What's the matter, boy, you hurt yourself or somethin'? Huh? It's swelling fast. Oh ain't that a shame. I plumb forgot my first aid kit, huh! Yeah I ain't no doctor, but I know a leg that bad gotta be cut off. Amputated! (Laughs) Now don't be an upstart now, boy. We got ways of handlin' upstarts, boy. Ain't we, Sonny Lew? For sure we do. Please. Please. [Cal] Only I ain't too sure just how in this case. No! (Policemen laugh) I, I can hop on one foot. - That's mighty nice! - Yeah. He wants to dance, boys, want a good dance. Hey! Hey don't nobody move. Cottonmouth. Just look at the size of that bastard. Yeah just look again. Gotta save this boy for his trial, right? This reptile, boy. In it is all the evils of the world, you know? It's a low thing, huh. Don't be afraid of it, boy. (Chuckles) He won't bite you! Maybe he knows you, huh? Talk to him, huh? Come on, boy, talk to it! [Ted] Don't bite me. I'm your friend. (policemen laugh) (Sonny Lew laughs) (suspenseful music) Were speedin' (mumbles). I would have been reasoned with a small fine, doc. They got in trouble with that woman, and I had to pull 'em in again. Loose women, doc. That woman the type. This white boy, he must have been half out of his mind in the swamp like that, huh? Well, he couldn't have known the area. That's right, doc. But you know, if there's somethin" I don't know about, The one thing that confuses me is the fact of him getting. Well, I can't rightly say. When me and my deputies came up on him he was already dead. Just lyin' there. Maybe there was a whole hatch of those things. [Doctor] Well alright, please have Luke and Cal sign that report I left as witnesses as soon as possible. How about the other one over here, doc? Wanna look at him too? No, Sonny Lew, that won't be necessary. Pretty certain he died from gunshot wounds. Yeah. Must have what they call, uh, stir-crazy, you know? He shouldn't have gotten in trouble in the first place. I'll send the wagon over for the bodies later in the morning. They're picking up first the body of that Sheriff Watt was shot down on Wednesday. Oh, yeah. Well that don't concern me being out of my county and all. But Doc, I don't know what's comin' to law and order in these parts. I mean everybody's being shot up and all that. People dyin' today who never died before. (Sonny Lew laughs) That's right. That's right. I gotta go home and get some more sleep. I'll call you in the mornin' when the wagon's ready. - You do that now. - Bye now, Sonny Lew. Jenny, get me Luke like a good girl. I want you over here right away, bring Cal along with you. Then we'll go pick up Les. Get everything set for the trial in the morning. Bring Claude along too to be the corroborative witness. Don't matter what it means, just bring him over, huh? (coughs) (sighs) Now boys, grab a seat and we'll talk to you, huh? I've had the Foreman on the line for the arrangements of this trial in the mornin”. I'm sorry to get you boys out of bed, but I ain't had any sleep myself yet. Now I wanna talk to you about this here trial. I'm gonna ask you a few questions, just like the old DA would. And I hopin' real bad you know all your lessons. I wouldn't wanna see you fail the test, huh? Now, Les. And they stopped you? Yeah, this one who was bitten by the snakes. For $40. Can you elaborate any further? Huh? Tell us more, Les. Well. They said I could go off to Pugin's Motel, and that she'd be real obliging. You get an A+ for that. You Claude, you answered the call from somebody. Why don't you say who it was from now. It was a call for Les. They didn't say who it was. [Sonny] You didn't have any trouble with them yourself, did you? Did you? He sort of gave me a dirty funny look. Normally I wouldn't serve people like that, - You run a real fine tavern. - Thank you. Say, when does your license renewal come up, next month? Yes, Sheriff. Well, you shouldn't have any trouble. Yeah. (Chuckles) That's a real nice place, Claude. It's too bad sometime riff raff stop in and that ain't no fault. (Chuckles) [Sonny] You won't have any trouble, Claude. You don't mind testifying? No, Sheriff. No, Sheriff. Glad to. I'm gonna have these two deputies escort you two gentlemen. Hey Luke, remember what you promised about Nellie now. Get your hands off me. You smell somethin' bad, Les. (Sonny giggles) Now suppose you testify at the trial like Sonny Lew wants you to, then we'll see. Besides that you know she's a mighty busy little critter. Now take off! I can't be seen talkin' to you. You're a witness, you know. You need us for anything more? No, you boys can go home. You'll be needin' some rest for the trial in the mornin'. I got one more little job I've been thinkin' of. - Goodnight, Sonny Lew. - Goodnight, Luke. (Sonny coughs) "And thou has polluted the land with thy whoredom, "therefore the showers have been withholden, "and there hath been no rain. "And thou hadst a whore's forehead. "Thou refusedst to be ashamed.” (dark chime music) (Jean screams) (Jean screams) (Jean screams) (slap) (Jean screams) Mornin', Sonny Lew. Listen Doc somethin' new has come up and I need your help. Listen doc, I hope you'll do a little job for me. Yeah? What kind of a job? Well it concerns this trial comin' up in the mornin... Yeah? Everything's all set for the trial, doc, but I'm gonna need a bit more testimony. What kind of testimony? Well, just somethin' to add a little bit of weight, you know? Sonny Lew, I'll be honest with you. I don't wanna get involved in law. (Sonny chuckles) You don't wanna get involved. (Chuckles) You don't wanna get involved. (Chuckles) Like you didn't wanna get involved those two abortions, huh? Like you didn't wanna be involved with old Jake Connors, peddlin' those goofballs to innocent kids? Now that's all over with now. Ain't nobody knows you practice with no license. Now you do like I say, you hear me? Yeah. - I hear ya. - All right. I want you to listen real careful like, doc. Now I want no slip-ups, you old phony. I want you to make a record report. Why? You're gonna prove that girl had immoral relations with both her traveling companions. The sun is shinin', the birds are singin'. Hey girl, stop your cryin'. Bein' in jail ain't so bad. Beats travelin' the highway lookin' for easy cash. Maybe she's repentin', doc. Naw, she ain't repentin', she's a born sinner. Naw, she ain't repentin', she's a born sinner. It's all right, young lady. The doc is gonna give you a little examination. It's just routine, you know, before the trial. She ain't very friendly, is she, doc? What's wrong with her, Sheriff? Nothin'. Probably somethin' she ate for supper. Yeah. Alright let's get on with it, doc, I ain't got all day. Okay. But I need your help. Go out and boil about a pint of water. Okay, doc. I'll be right back. Listen, young lady. You might not know this but I'm the only friend you've got. It's a real lucky thing, doc. I had a little water boiled for coffee. Everything goin' on fine back here? Everything's fine, Sonny Lew. I was just startin'. Doc, I know this is a medical examination and all that but. I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna stand right outside this cell door while you look at her. I know it's a little out of the usual, doc, but this is a special situation, because the trial's coming up in a few hours and all and I gotta be able to hear any testimony that might blurt out of her pretty lips while you examine her. Blurt out of her pretty lips while you examine her. That's the way it's gotta be, doc. Let's begin then. Will you step outside, Sheriff? Please remove your dress, dear. (hammering thuds) Order in the court! Order in the court. Well, little lady. I want you to meet your defense attorney. This here is Seth Waters. Now listen to me, Miss Rollins. If you cooperate with me, I'll make sure you get only a light sentence. A light sentence? I'm innocent! Sonny Lew says your guilty. This is his town. You're a stooge for him like all the rest. Now listen, don't argue. This is the best way. Leave me alone. What's the matter, Rocco, gettin' some legal ethics in your old age? Couldn't happen to a nicer fella. I just want to get this over with, quick as possible, I just want to get this over with, quick as possible, but that would be impossible once you start talkin... Oh I reckon this might be a real long trial. All two hours, think you can stay sober that long? [Seth] Don't you worry about me. Court is now in session! Cal! May you read the charges? Uh, hear ye, hear ye, Possumin County and the chair of Carson's Landing versus Miss Jean Rollins, Mr. Ted Branch and Mr. Artie Dickson. Uh, the latter two is deceased and won't be able to appear. (Judge laughs) [Judge] Silence in the court! Cal! Now do you swear that everything you're gonna say is the truth, so help you god? Well, Mr. Martin um, may I call you Claude? Claude, where were on the night of Tuesday, July 17th at about 7:30 in the evening? Where I am every night at 7:30. Tendin' bar at my own place. Been there every night for the last eight years. Except for the time I caught the tick fever. Well, we ain't exactly interested in your medical history, Claude, but you said that you were at your tavern. You also serve food there? Yeah but business ain't been so good lately. I only had two customers that night when them three birds come in. The three named in the indictment? That's right, the white and colored boy and this woman over there. Go on, what happened then? Well, they sat down at one of them tables. You know, the one you usually sit in when you come in. Nevermind that, go on, go on, boy. Well, the white boys comes up to the bar. When I tell him the price he looks at me real dirty like. And he ain't got no cause to do that, he ain't one of the regulars. What do you know about a phone call? Well, the phone ringed and it was for old Les Davis. Everybody knows old Les Davis. Well after talkin', Les hangs up and he walks over to the door. Figured he'd get some air since the air conditioning went sour about two weeks ago. Did he get to the door? Yeah but on his way back to the bar he stopped by the white boy. Les obliged and stuck down to listen "'cause the white boy was tryin' to tell him somethin' and I don't know what was said but the way Les got all red and jumped up, I figured it was somethin' real bad. Then Les tell 'em that uh, (He's man enough to get his own, {chuckles) that his wife could outclass the bitch they offered him any day. He was real lucky just then, the two deputies come in. No tellin' what Les might have done to that boy. That's all, Claude, you can step down now. Call the next witness. Do you swear that everything you're gonna say is true, so help you god? Yeah, I do. Mr. Davis. We just heard the testimony concerned the night of Tuesday. We just heard the testimony concerned the night of Tuesday July the 17th from Mr. Martin. First off, tell us that all he said was correct. Absolutely correct. Well then, is there anything that you can add? Yes, this. Without being accosted by some cheap whore, then something's real wrong. Now she ain't from these parts, 'cause we got a real clean town here. Thanks to the Sheriff and his two deputies. Right. But we gotta teach her and her kind a lesson. So don't get no fancy ideas comin" down here with that poor white trash! Mind ya now, I ain't had nothin' against the colored boy. But he probably had somethin' on him. Did they ask you for money? $20, they did. Is basing his whole defense on the claim that she's touched in the head. Now uh, I don't know anything about this psychiatry stuff, but uh, I did pick up a little book at the station in the city. It's written so as anybody can understand it. Now, I've been readin' up on this nymphomania. One thing funny about it, though. They don't make no mention of the woman getting money. Says they always do it for the sheer pleasure. No, sir. Don't make no mention of money. I guess she's a real unusual case. Do you swear everything you're gonna say is the truth? Yes, I do. So help you God. Yes. Dr. Hall, you're also the county coroner? Been that for 20 years. And to put it so as everybody can understand, And to put it so as everybody can understand, in all your years you've seen just about everything a doctor can see. I'd say that pretty well sums it up. I want you to tell us about a little examination. Well, that was just one of them routine examinations we always do just before a trial, just double-checkin' that everything's okay. Did you make this examination alone? Well uh, yes. You see, my nurse, Emma Lew Royal, hadn't been feelin' too good lately, she's gettin' on in age. Then you performed this examination alone. I want you to tell us exactly what you did, doctor. I think I can better illustrate that graphically. [Attorney] Whatever you say, doc. Uh. I'll try and describe it in terms that everybody understand. The slide is divided into four sections. These uh, these uh little, wiggly worm-like substances are called sperm or spermatozoa. They are the male reproductive cells which fertilize the female ovum. Very small and in fact invisible to the naked eye. These samples of course have been magnified. These samples of course have been magnified several hundred times. There are also obvious differences between and these came from the colored boy, Artie Dickson. These other bottom samples I'll get to later when I reveal where all these samples came from. Deputy Luke, would you put on the other slide, please? I'm afraid I've played a little trick on ya. This slide I just had Luke post samples of a spermatozoa taken from the bodies of the white boy and the colored boy taken from the bodies of the white boy and the colored boy during autopsy. As you can see, these samples match the top of the previous slide perfectly. The first samples come from the body of Miss Jean Rollins. They were taken during the intensive examination I conducted during daybreak. They are from the girl's oviduct, that is the part of the female organ where the ovum is fertilized by the male sperm. In short she had been having carnal relations with both these boys. In fact, we don't even know where the other two samples come from. Probably some god-forsaken big-spendin' dudes. Probably some god-forsaken big-spendin' dudes. No tellin' how many men she done had. Don't suppose you wanna cross-examine. You've heard the complete evidence presented by both sides and now the court is asking you to base your decision on that evidence alone. No matter what your feelings or prejudices might have, they must be put aside and this case judged solely by the evidence you people heard. Now, Mr. Gimimead Albud, the Foreman of the jury, will take you out to my chambers and there you will vote. Your Honor. That won't be necessary. We've already reached our decision. (hammering thuds) All right, Mr. Foreman. Will you please the court and give us your decision. We, the members of this jury, find in an unanimous verdict, the defendant, Miss Jean Rollins, to be guilty as charged. (Judge burps) Thank you. You may now be seated. A jury of citizens of the township and Possumin County, A jury of citizens of the township and Possumin County, township of Carson's Landing find you guilty as charged. You're nothing but a bunch of pigs and murderers. You killed both Ted and Artie. Now it takes a whole town plus a phony judge and jury to convict me. Why bother? Why not save yourselves all this trouble and kill me too? I was already tried, convicted, and sentenced before I ever walked into this place. Stinking court room. What I'm going to say won't make any difference now. Your enforcers make up the rules as they go along. I was brutally raped by your respected sheriff, repeatedly mauled and treated like an animal. Wake up. Can't you see you're living in your own private worlds? There are things going on outside that you're not even aware of. The world is moving forward and you're standing still. You finished? You can do whatever you want with me. Won't make any difference now. Due to the intervention of our fine sheriff, you will not be incarcerated in the county penal institution instead your sentence is commuted to 90 days, and to be served at Clyde Fuller's work. You should find it very educational there. Now I don't know what you niggers think you're gettin' away with. I ain't gonna take it no more. When I say a full day"s work, I don't mean no 8 hour, When I say a full day"s work, I don't mean no 8 hour, Each one of you's gonna have to fill up 100 bushels a day. And if you can't stay awake, little baby here's gonna bite into your skin to remind you. If I hear any of your talkin' out there, I'll cut your tongues out. This ain't no talk farm, it's a work farm. Now don't none of you forget it. All right, move on out of there. Already cost me 10 minutes of good workin' time. (dramatic music) But I'm gonna wear you down woman. Before long you'll be bendin' to my way of thinkin'. You know, I'm watchin' my little ole chain gang, and they're gonna do a lot more sweatin' before the sun goes down. Because startin' tomorrow, you're gonna be chained to the end of that string of darkies. Women we get out here, got the privilege or workin' around the property, around the house doin' domestic type chores. But you're a big strong girl with no appreciative heart, (Jean spits) Alright you little tramp, then so be it! We're gettin' out tomorrow. Think we can make it? I've planned long enough. I can't take it any longer. Maybe we'll make it and maybe we won't, but I ain't spendin' the rest of my life picking crops 16 hours a day. I'm with you, Tom. Now there ain't nothin' gonna go wrong. Now there ain't nothin' gonna go wrong. It's gotta work, I've planned this thing for the last month. Now you're in the front of the chain gang, right? Yeah. And I'm on the end, that's the whole thing. And the guard's eatin' his grub, you go and get a case of sunstroke. Fall down and faint like a spell. Me? All day I'll be usin' this. Been usin" it a little each day when I was supposed to be. The chain's almost gone now, just need a little more. When you gonna break it? When the guard's sweatin' over you, you're gonna get real sick, throw up and all. Make it look real good. (door knock) [Man] Quiet in there, all of ya keep quiet! Get to sleep so you'll be good and strong in the mornin'! When you get back from the fields tonight, I got a report last night you was talkin' after nine o'clock lights out. You know the rules, boy. They're posted in every shack, real neat and proper like. And I know you can read. Maybe you're just plain dumb. Well I got a real pleasant day planned for you. Boy. You look at that girl like that just once more, Sonny Lew? Sonny Lew, you've gotta help me! Please come quick, there's been an escape! The big one, Tom, he got away with the girl. They slugged my boy Jerry and hurt him real bad! The others are locked up. Tom and girl are headed for the swamp. You've gotta come quick, please hurry. With him on the loose there's not tellin' what he might do! (siren wailing) It good to get us a quick gesture. Give me that, give me that. You track them down? Well how much of a head start they got, Sheriff? Not far. We'll get 'em, Sheriff. Good, glad to hear it, boy. Alright men, listen up! You can all consider yourself deputized. Now that means shoot to kill, huh? - (Jean screams) - Shut up! A snake. You scream like that again, they'll be on us in no time. - It came out of that skull. - Don't worry about him. Couldn't hurt a thing. (energetic music) Speaking like a country boy, You wouldn't be here now. Mr. Fuller had women chained to me twice before, and never more than one day though. They all decided to meet Mr. Fuller's request. (dramatic music) I'm the biggest. That's why he hates me so. Not being small and runny like he is. Insane man, I'd sooner take my chances in the swamp than with him, but you were wrong. You would have had to wait a lot longer than one day. You would have had to wait a lot longer than one day. (Tom laughs) Honey, I heard all about how you was travelin'. I wouldn't mind doing the same with you myself. Providing we lose the posse. We can't stay around here all day, I think I heard hounds. (dramatic music) (dogs barking) I can't hear them hounds no more. They must have stopped to rest. I couldn't sleep, I'm too nervous. I'll use it, I swear! You touch me- You shouldn't refuse me. - Scream for the posse. - We're both in this together. It'd go a lot worse for you than for me if we get caught. I like you a lot. (dogs barking) They're closer than I thought. We gotta do something quick, give me that rock. I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear anything. - Give it to me. - Don't touch me. Give it to me! Alright now, we stay close together now huh? This place is full of snakes and gators. We're gonna get them not get ourselves killed, right? Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey, Lord. I'm prayin' for you to give me the strength to carry on. To carry on in order justice to prevail. I don't have enemies, Lord. A little prayin' never hurt anybody, boys. Especially a time like this. (Chuckles) (dogs barking) Look! They stopped to rest on this hot ground. Their footprints still got water in 'em. They can't be more than 200 yards away. They can't be more than 200 yards away. (dogs barking) You go on ahead. Get goin' quick! (dogs barking) Gonna take my stand right here. (gun fires) (dogs barking) (gun fires) (screams) (gun fires) (guns fire rapidly) [Sonny] Help! [Cal] He's bitten, ain't he? [Luke] Yeah. (suspenseful music) What's happened to you, ma'am? It was horrible, horrible. Now easy, ma'am. They killed Ted and Artie. My friends were murdered in cold blood. They molested me and beat me. They chained me to a gang of convicts. They were going to kill me. Carson's Landing. Then those guns I heard came from the swamp. Well it's true, alright. This is the evidence we've wanted for a long time. We'll be able to put "em all away for quite a while. You're the first one who's gotten out alive. You're the first one who's gotten out alive. Hardly even had him pinned. [Cal] But it went dead so fast. Do you reckon it's likely for a man to get frightened to death?
