Go there, I'll show you this amazing place. Come. Did you ever jump? You shit your pants, eh? My father told me a legend. Would you like to know it? So, then there was this crook, called Fox, because he was very smart. He Was running away and he hid in a barn. Christian, are you coming? But there was this boy living there. - The boy finds him... - And he kills him. No! They become friends. - No, I don't Want to! - Come on. Let's go swimming. - I don't feel like it. - Come on, look at the water, is beautiful. Yeah, but I don't really like the sea, so... - Come on, let's go. - No, I don't Want to. And he hangs with him, brings him food... But one day they get caught. They were running, and running, until they get right here. And then Fox said they had to jump. - And they jumped. - And did they survive? No, they died. Both of them? Both of them. Ok, then I'm going back home. But, if you're here tomorrow, we can meet, right? And where am I supposed to go? In the woods? In the woods? What the fuck are you talking about?

He didn't make it. They left a notice. Do you want me to read it? - Sir, are you there? - Yes. Today, June 8th 1976. Armed Proletarian Cells put to death the State executor Francesco Guarna. And the two mercenaries that were protecting him. This action fulfils the following purposes: it gives substance to the strategic line of the attack at the core of the State that goes against the working class with all its coercive actions. Moreover, it develops and doesn't end "Le Rose" operation. Whose target was to underline the violent counter-revolutionary contents of the imperialist State behind a democratic mask. Our message is mostly for him. The judge should know that we didn't finish with him, and that he turns out to be our next target. Anywhere he's hiding. Honour to him, comrade Montanari and to her, comrade Balzarano. Thank you, Gaetano. We'll talk soon. Mom, can Christian sleep over here? Yes. You too. Take this. I need to get some fresh air. - Where do you want to go, sir? - We take a walk this way. Let's do this, you guys go down driving... - It's dangerous, sir! - No, don't worry. Look... - I grew up here.
