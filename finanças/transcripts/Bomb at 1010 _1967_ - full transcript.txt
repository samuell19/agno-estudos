Yeah, I think so. With luck, we will see each other. (chuckles) ("Pia's Theme" sung by Olivera Vuco) * (singing in Serbian) * (singing in Serbian) * (singing in Serbian) * (singing in Serbian) * (singing in Serbian) (train rumbling) Tickets, please. (train whistle blows) (mumbling) Out, everybody. (train rumbling) (train brakes squeal) (footsteps) (yells in German) (train whistle blows) We are looking for escaped prisoners. One is tall, brown hair, blue eyes. One of the faces is partially bruised, an American. I don't remember seeing such a man. Also, another, one is shorter, dark, Yugoslav. One or the other is wounded. I am sure they're not on this train. He lies. A man answering the description of American was here just a few minutes ago. Search everything. (loud train rumbling) (steam blows) (train whistle blows) (loud train rumbling) We have checked every compartment. He is not on the train. He's jumped off. (steam blows) (train brakes squeal) (dogs barking in the distance) (dogs barking in the distance) (whistles blowing) (dogs barking) (footsteps) -(dogs barking) -(footsteps) (gun shots) (gun shots) (gun shots) (yelling in German) Man on bridge: Fire, fire!

Hey, mister, wait! (brush rustling) Man in blue coat: Come with us. Man in tan coat: Don't be afraid. Man in blue coat: Follow us. (hollow banging) (muffled banging) Man wearing a hat: Come in, quickly. Man: Steve! Hey, Marko, you son of a gun! (laughing) Welcome. You know, I was afraid you didn't make it. -Almost. -Yeah. You don't look bad for an ex-prisoner. -No. -You're all wet. And a little cold, too. Come. (music) Six months in the hole of hell is quite enough. Yes. (train whistle blows) Your friend arrived a couple of days ago. Friend? Commandant of concentration camp Stalag D 16. Hassler? You're joking. No. Marko: Our underground has learned that he intends to make this city the spearhead of German invasion into the Middle East. Marko: With the Balkans firmly under control, Germany will be able to increase its pressure in the east. And it's aged to Rommel in the South. How do I get to him? It won't be easy. He knows I'm from this area. He might even suspect that you are here, too. Especially after today. All right, where do we start? He's clever and suspicious. You'd better think it over. You're under no obligation to stay. I already have, the only thing that kept me alive in that hole was the thought that someday I'd meet Hassler again without a gun in my back. We are also planning a welcome for Hassler. I'm going to see the end of him. Look here. In four days, Hassler has announced that he will make a speech at the square, proclaiming full control of the city. All the citizens have been ordered to hear his proclamation, which will climax with Hassler receiving a medal for his work as Commandant of concentration camp Stalag D 16. A medal? (chuckles) They will follow this route. Tomorrow, a construction crew will start repairing the road at this point. Two of the workers will be members of the underground. What are you driving at? We will place an explosive, dynamite, under the cobblestone. Over this point, Hassler's car must pass. Explosives, dynamite, nuts. You just give me a good rifle. He may be in an armored car. All right, what's your plan? Marko: We're getting dynamite. Yeah, get to the point. According to our plan, our man was to make himself known to them by walking past them several times in company with a girl at a designated time. Sounds like a game. Yes, but it's no game. It's a necessary precaution. Well, I'm a bit slow and tired but keep going. The plan has met with a setback. Yesterday, the girl we had chosen was captured by the Gestapo. It's possible that, by now, the Germans have extracted some information. So, they could be waiting. There is that risk. So, we must get you to the coast. Not so fast, there's got to be a way. You mentioned dynamite? Best you rest, son. I'll explain more later. Something is wrong, what is it? I know how you feel about Hassler. Don't let it affect your judgment. Thanks for the warning. (sneaky music) (sneaky music) (sneaky music) (moves into curious music) Steve: This girl was walking right about in here. Went back and forth a couple times, crossed the street, went up those stairs, to those buildings. That's the university, she could be a student. Yeah, 'bout that age. Did she do anything that could be interpreted as a signal? It could be, I'm not sure. A German guard came around about then. There are three possibilities. She could be from our underground, a German agent, or a student. Coincidentally walking back and forth, hm? Marko: It seems unlikely. Tomorrow, we'll have to make our decision. That's when we're supposed to contact the workers. Yeah, we'll need fuses, detonator caps, wire plungers, explosive charges-- We have everything except the explosives. You've said that before. Sorry if I sound impatient. Your eagerness is understandable. Remember, I was in that camp, too. We'll get the explosives tonight. (drums) (enticing clarinet music) (fast beat drumming) (enticing clarinet music) (applauding) This is my friend. Hello. Did you get the explosives? No, it's impossible now, next week. Steve: Next week will be too late. -True. -Tonight, Germans were talking. Two bombs landed on the Vamach building not far from here. Only one exploded. Explosives. Where is it? I'll show you. -Come. (footsteps) It will be guarded until the German demolition squad arrives. -Then we must hurry. -Right. Watch out, there's one. I shall talk to him. (sneaky music) Guard: You come here. It's passed curfew, what are you doing here? I'm on my way home. I work at the night club. Here's my pass. This is not good after curfew. (sneaky music) Oh yes, I've seen you dance, very nice. I get off duty soon, I could see that you get home safely. What area do you guard? This whole block. Oh. What's that over there? I'll show you. Oh. (sneaky music) (footsteps) (speaking in German) (speaking in German) (footsteps) -The bomb is not here. -What? They said it's been taken. We better find Mira. (engines) (brakes squealing) Halt, halt, halt! (gun shots) (yelling in German) (whistle blows) (gun shots) -(footsteps) -(whistle blows in the distance) (yelling in German) Steve, take off your shoes. What? I'll lead them away. Are you taking off yours? Not me, hurry. Look, forget it, we'll both take our chances. Come on. (screams) You beast! (screams) (whistle blows in the distance) (sneaky music) (whistle blows) (footsteps) (loud bang) (grunts) (choking) (footsteps) (footsteps) (grunts) (footsteps in the distance) (gun shots) (grunts) (gun fire) (glass breaking) (heavy breathing) (motor running) (gun clicks) (grunting) (music) (whistle blows in the distance) -(yelling in German) -(footsteps) (yelling in German) (yelling) (gun fire) (groans) Number three. One, possibly eight or three. And the two other numbers marred by a bullet wound. Is that it? Man: Yes, Herr Colonel . Nothing more? Man: Nothing. Man: There was another man with him, he escaped. Two men running. Still they killed five soldiers, unbelievable, unbelievable! Find the officers responsible and have them court-martialed. Man: Yes, sir. I must have men, not morons. What about the woman? She was a dancer in a club. Colonel Hassler: What do you mean, was? They found her dead, sir, an accident. An accident, what kind of accident? Well, sir... I said what kind? Some of our troops, they've made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes these days. Well, let this be their last. Have the men involved transferred to the Russian Front. Yes, sir. Did you find anything more about her? No, sir. Yes, sir; no, sir; yes, sir; no, sir. Is that all I can get? What kind of idiots do I have working for me? A 300 pound bomb taken right out under your noses. Three stupid noses, such stupidity I cannot believe. Yes, sir. For God sakes, stop saying, "Yes, sir." Get me the records of the prisoners and bring the dead one here. I know those faces well. Lieutenant... My record as commandant of camp D 16 was marred by only one accident. A successful escape by two men who could be here now. Plotting at this very moment to kill me. Colonel Hassler: The girl who was to contact their underground here, has she told you more? No, not yet, except that-- No, of course not. They are too clever. Even so young a girl would be well trained. You keep working on her until she talks. Sooner or later, they all do. The human body can only take so much. About the information she did give us last night, I was thinking of assigning Agent OX 2 to take her place. No, I have already taken care of the matter. Colonel Hassler: There'll be no mistakes this time. In a way it is challenging. I have always loved games, and what's more exciting than the game of life or death? I will enjoy outwitting him and bringing him to the hangman's noose. Now, carry on. Yes, sir. I wonder... (ominous music) (moves into sneaky music) (moves into playful music) Excuse me. Are you speaking to me? Uh, I seem to be lost. I need some directions. Where did you wish to go? Well, I, uh, I think it's out in that direction. I'm going that way, I'll try to help you. Thank you. (ominous music) (moves into playful music) Nice day. You know I, I could be wrong, it might be that way. (engines running) (speaking in German) I'm terribly sorry, I'm late for an appointment. (officers speaking in German) (ominous music) (officers speaking in German) (banging) (hollow banging) Man: Marko, Marko! (man laughing) (man speaking in a foreign language) (laughs) Marko, Marko! Marko isn't here. American! I, Andre, what's your name? My name is Steve. Steve. (speaks in a foreign language) (laughs) Where is Marko? We, uh, we ran into Gestapo. Gestapo? That's bad. Very bad. Well if he made it, he should be here any minute. We went to see a bomb that wasn't there. Bomb. We have bomb, explosives! What, you have the bomb? We took, I show you bomb. (laughs) Where is Marko? Man: Who is it? This is American. American! Marko's friend is my friend. (laughs) Where is it? (sneaky music) Hello! -(laughs) -What's he doing? Take explosives. Get him out. What? Good mechanic, explosives! Look, he may be a good mechanic but that's a bomb! -Bomb? -A bomb, boom! Bomb, boom, boom? Jake, Jake! Andre: Jake, slowly, slowly, get out. Jake: Why? Andre: Get out! Get out, Jake! Man: What happened? (Andre laughs) Good luck, baby. (laughs) Get everybody out. What? Just get 'em out. Or do you wanna see them all blown to hell? -To hell? -Yeah, hell, now move. Hey wait, get me the tools. Tools? Tools, Jacob's tools. Ah, Jacob. -Make fast. -Yeah. Andre: Jacob, Jacob, tools, quickly. (tool box bangs loudly) Don't ever do that. Me help. No, no, you no help, just me help. -No help? -No, you get everybody out. -Move them out far, fast. -Okay, okay. Hey, got any whiskey? Whiskey? Yeah, whiskey, Congac, anything. Ah, Congac, drink? No, no, wash my feet. Ah, wash my feet. Oh, me get! Andre: Move, move! No, Congac, brandy, wash feet, good. Great, look, just get everybody out. -Get out, get out. -Why? -Everybody out. -Okay, okay. Andre: Quickly, move! (door slams) (tense music) Ah, good luck, baby. (tense music) (moves to triumphant music) Andre! Andre! We're still not absolutely sure it's the American that disgraced you at D 16. You are not sure but I have a different theory. Call it intuition. There's a good reason for him to be here. Ten good reasons. And I am convinced of something else. The girl you're interrogating is a part of the whole plan. Well, hello again. Oh, hello. You know I'm, uh, I'm still lost. I'm sorry. Look, I know you've got every right to be annoyed with me but just try to humor me. Try to think of me as an eccentric uncle. That won't be difficult. Oh? (chuckles) (ominous music) What part of America is your home? Well now, just what makes you think I'm from America? I study languages. Oh. (chuckles) Well, that's very interesting. There's just been a change of plans. Do you trust me? Trust you, what trust? Good, that's all the better. Well, wait, where are we going? We'll figure that out later, come on. I don't like being followed. I'd just as soon that you weren't either. I don't wanna get you involved. Involved in what? You have heard of the Gestapo, haven't you? Quick, there he is again! (crowd cheering) (crowd roars) (crowd cheering) (choking sounds) (crowd cheering) (gasps) (footsteps) (ominous music) I'm sorry I got you involved in this. You'd better go now. Will I ever see you again? No, it's better not to. But... But, why? (apprehensive music) Good evening, my dear. Good evening, Colonel. It will take a few more meetings before you get used to the idea of having a father, hm? Why are you not wearing the new clothes I bought for you? I, I want to save them for an occasion. Ah, no, over there. You want to see me? Yes, I can hardly believe it, you were only eight the day I left. Colonel Hassler: Furious because your teacher hadn't hung your drawing on the classroom wall. You have a good memory. We were children when you were born. Yes, I have, you, your mother. But you left. It was my destiny. Duty to join the Nazi party. Colonel Hassler: It has proven me right. Only time will tell. Germany's objective will be inevitably achieved. It is only a question of the time you speak of. Is that why you asked me to go to that intersection? I thought you would enjoy the experience of being the one who makes the contact we expect. You had no success? No. I wish you would allow me to have a Gestapo agent to watch you. It could be dangerous. I said I would agree to do what you asked only if I could do it without bodyguards. So, you enjoy the thrill of the hunt too? Colonel Hassler: Like father, like daughter. Has anyone been following me? Of course not, if no contact is made soon, we will abandon it. (sighs) If you have nothing more to tell me, may I leave? No, no, you may not. We must learn to work together. You can be of great help to me. I'm only half German. Half German is enough. You are part of your father. I am proclaiming the city in two days. You will ride in my car. Is that an order? You are free to choose. Thank you. I'll think it over. Very well. May I go now? Yes, of course. (apprehensive music) (whistle blows in the distance) (footsteps) (footsteps) Who is your friend? Marko. Okay, go, quickly, go on! (footsteps) (loud bang) (footsteps) Watch, it's slippery. You fellas were on the work crew, weren't you? Yeah, we had to be sure. Are you hurt? No, but he is a little careless. You trust the girl? Yes, she's a student. Come. (water splashing) (footsteps) You have bomb? -Yeah. -Good. This is intersection. -No, thanks. -The bomb will be put here. Hassler's car goes from headquarters at 10 o'clock. It takes him maybe 10 minutes to reach here. What are you talking about? The bomb. That pig in his car, when they go over, will be blown to pieces! And just how do you intend to detonate that bomb? (laughs) You're American and you have American bomb and you don't know? Hell, I only drop 'em. But you take apart? I helped take one apart about 20,000 feet over London once but that doesn't make me an expert. Maybe electric? Yeah, could be. Okay, come. We have plenty of power! We'd have to get power to the detonator. We'll need a switch of some kind. We have switch. No, bigger, plunger. Plunger. We have that. Good. We'll have to get a line from the plunger to the bomb. The plunger would have to be at least a hundred feet away to be safe. From a position to see Hassler's car. Hey, is that a, that a water main going across there? Yes. Does the water hydrant go up close? Yes, this is above the street. Maybe we could use that. It's crazy. This whole thing is crazy. Oh, it's crazy, I must have sounded like a real nut. -Crazy? -Yeah, crazy. How do you expect to get the bomb down here? How do you get it out to the middle of the road? And then how do you get it wired? You know, Hassler's no fool, he's gonna have mine detectors all over these tunnels. -There are many old tunnels closed off. I'll show you. We have headquarters there. We will carry the bomb down here after the mine detectors have checked. That's fine, fine, and that'll give us about an hour to get it wired. Well, maybe, uh, maybe 10 minutes. Or maybe, maybe no minutes. It's crazy I tell ya. Crazy, but we take a chance. We kill him, we will do it. Thanks, Mr. Corbett, come. Hold on. Look, give me some time to think. This is gonna take some time to figure out. Good, we all think. Come. (cover bangs loudly) (yells in German) (footsteps) This way. (water splashing) (footsteps) Stay here. (gun shots) Go on. (choking sounds) (footsteps) (gun shots) (gun shots) (grunts) Officer: Halt, halt! (gun shots) (grunts) (screams) (water splashing) (groans) We fixed 'em. No clues how they got there? Do you think they committed suicide? They're dead, Herr Colonel, that's all I know, but uh, if I may point out something, sir. Yes? The guards that were killed were on patrol at grid coordinates seven C and 14 G. Colonel Hassler: So? It's one mile from the river. That's the same district where the girl had to make contact. Yes, Herr Lieutenant? There is a web of underground tunnels, drainage canals. I think the guards' bodies floated down the sewers to the river. It's also possible the attempt on your life could come from there. (tense music) (tense music) May I order an immediate search of the tunnels? No, not yet. You're still not sure it's my American friend working with the underground. I will track him down with your help, Lieutenant. Yes, sir. We must give him time to lay his trap then we will close it for him. (tense music) (car horn beeps) (engine stalling) Officer: You can't stay here. (engine stalling) Kaput. Officer: Get moving. Kaput. (engine stalling) (guard speaking in German) Man on truck: Yeah, yeah. (speaking in German) Man on truck: Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. (guard speaks in German) (engine starting) (tense music) Hello, hello! I was wondering if I was ever going to see you again. Wait! Look, I told you it's dangerous. I want you to stay away from me. I want to talk to you. Or would you rather I scream? No. Look, I told you before I don't wanna get you involved. I am involved. Yeah. Do you know a Professor Pilic? Electrical engineer, university? Yes, do you know where I might find him? Now? University. Why? I'd like to talk to him. Would you take me there? Yes, let's go. (sneaky music) -Wait here. -Look... I wanna, wanna apologize and thank you. Don't thank me yet. How do you know I'm not a German spy? You wish to speak to me? Yes, Professor Pilic. Steve: You don't know me, Professor, but I read many of your articles in the scientific journals. I haven't much time, what is it you wish? I must have a transformer. A professional one for high voltage. It's impossible. Steve: Professor, Professor, it is at the request of your countrymen. Success of a mission depends on it. Tell you it's impossible. All professional equipment must be cleared with the Germans. You could request one for your laboratory. If they should find out, I have a family to think of. Professor, your countrymen also have families. (footsteps) Germans coming. Here, take this, look busy. (footsteps) Heil Hitler , Professor Pilic? Yes? Officer: You are ordered to dismiss your classes tomorrow. Oh? All students must attend Colonel Hassler's proclamation speech. Officer: Is that clear? Well? Yes. When do you need it? Tomorrow morning, by 8am. It will be in here. It would be better if only the girl came. -Professor-- -Yes. You're doing a great service to your country. I don't want to know anything about it, now go. Maybe now, you will tell me who you are and what you're doing here. Now, you heard the Professor, it's best that you don't know. I'm not the Professor. Steve: No, you certainly aren't. Tell me, are all the women here so curious? Or do you have an ulterior motive? Perhaps. I'm concerned. Concerned? It's possible the Germans know you're here. Yeah, it's possible they know an American is here, but who? Don't underestimate them. (siren blows) Girl: That way. (explosions) (close explosions) Well, thanks. And, um, no introductions. (laughs) No. Well I do believe that introductions are in order. My name is Steve. The rest doesn't matter. My name is Pija. The rest does matter. Oh? But I can be mysterious, hm? Well, here's to mystery. Oh, tell me more about you. More? Yes, I'm supposed to bring you, tomorrow, something very important. Yeah. It would be too bad if I oversleep. Now, that is blackmail. (laughs) Well, I can tell you this much, the mission I'm on is for the good of your people, humanity. I'm sure you would approve of that. Tell me more. I think that's about it for now. Tomorrow you pick up my little toy and you bring it to me at eight. Eight sharp, by that tree, okay? Okay. Good. Well, it sounds like it's over. Hey, how 'bout some tea now? All right. (distant explosions) Are, are the bombers coming back? No, it's probably just stragglers still bombing North of here. Oh, well, I hope your friends don't make a mistake. Yeah, me too, just hit 'em where it hurts, fellas. Only leave Hassler for me. (suspicious music) You, you know Colonel Hassler? Yes, I was a guest at his rest home, concentration camp Stalag D 16. My little parachute floated right down into the middle of a German headquarters. You met him personally? Yes, many times. Hassler had the impression that I was full of information he wanted. And did you give him such information? No, but I might have if I was there much longer. You know, he had a way that if you didn't talk, he discouraged your desire to live. So... that's why you came here? To kill Colonel Hassler? No, I was on my way to the Adriatic to join the American forces. When I heard he was here, I decided to stay. You wish to kill Hassler, revenge yourself? Yes. Yes, and many others. Steve: Hassler and his kind shouldn't be allowed to live. They're not human. Well, that's me in a nutshell. What about you, hm? There isn't much to tell. I'm going to school. Someday, I would like to be a teacher, that's all. You live here all by yourself, no parents? No. Steve: No relatives? None. (knocking on door) Oh, Lieutenant. Excuse me, Miss Fermich, your father sent me, he would like to see you. Tomorrow? Lieutenant: Not tomorrow, now. Oh, you have company. A girlfriend's coming to have tea with me. But, doesn't matter. If you would like to change your clothes I can wait. Is there something wrong? Yes, I mean, no. I'll be a moment. (sad music) (ominous music) Oh yes, I have a little entertainment planned. Something you might enjoy. What is that room? A Gestapo interrogation room. Am I to be questioned? No, you may rest assured that if you have any secret information, it may remain secret. You are here only as a spectator, please observe. What are you going to do to them? Colonel Hassler: Do to them, that depends. Their fate is in their own hands. Colonel Hassler: Both men are condemned, they can win their freedom only by killing the other. Colonel Hassler: The man who walks out of the room alive wins my full pardon. Colonel Hassler: It is a question of life or death. A classic situation. One that has fascinated mankind for centuries. (dog barks) It's barbaric, monstrous! No, my dear, that's Machiavelli. And we were born to rule. Discipline and fear are the keynotes of our master plan. We will share my triumph together. You stopped trying to make that contact. Or have you made it? (menacing music) Milo, you'll take your position in the church tower, about 500 yards. Well, the water hydrant is ready. The meter box is gonna be useless without a transformer. The hydrant is suicide but we must use it. If the transformer comes, we must use that. Yeah, if. I could kill him easy from there. Yes, if he was not using an armored car. Look, the rifle is only used as a diversion, to make them detour. And to spring you men passed their guards. Now, a few rifle shots should do the trick. If not, you men with your homemade lollipops know what to do, is that clear? Do you understand? Did you get it? -(all) Yeah. -All right. You and I will take the plungers. Yes, but which plunger? I'll take the hydrant. I figure we draw for it. I'll take the chance. No, we will draw. You pick, the small one gets the hydrant. The bomb will go into place the minute the Germans have passed with the mine detectors. Okay, take up your positions, good luck. -Good luck, so long. -All right good luck. (group mumbles) Don't forget the detonator. Okay, Mr. Corbett. -Good luck. -Good luck. -(grunts) -(laughs) -(laughs) -Fall out. (ominous music) (package splashes) A young lady has taken it. What? Quite early. Thanks. There's something else you should know, or perhaps you already do. She's Colonel Hassler's daughter. Hassler's? I'm sorry Professor. What will you do now? Go ahead. The report is negative, sir Mine detecting unit found nothing. The tunnel reports should be in any time. Good, we will proceed, our original plan. There could be a slip-up, Herr Colonel, it's possible. Why the doubt? You've just assured me that all precautions have been taken. Since the American arrived, things have been unpredictable. Yes, he's desperate and cunning. Perhaps, you should delay the proclamation for a few days. (chuckles) Herr Lieutenant, I am desperate and cunning, too. Excuse me, you have a match? What? No. I know, you're Marko's friend, me too. Marko, I do not know him. I was responsible for the contact to be made by the American, but I didn't succeed. Now I found the girl is Hassler's daughter. Hassler's? Find the American and warn him. Dragon has been caught. Dragon caught? Early this morning. Tell all this to the American. Hurry now, and be careful. Leave the girl to me. The tunnels are clear, sir. Good. If I may say, I still think that you would be justified in the postponement. There shall be no postponement. We must bait our trap. Yes, sir. -(grunting) -This is heavy. Easy, easy there. Easy, come on, get the men up above. We'll help. No, this is a one man job. Come on, get movin'. -Okay. -Okay. Find Dragon. Try to stall Hassler. (sneaky music) (car horns blow) (rifle shots) Don't stop, you fool, turn this way. (explosions) (large explosion) (crowd screams) (sad music) No, no, we, we, we didn't kill Hassler. No kill. (gun fires) Genius, Major Corbett, genius. I take my hat off to you. Beautifully executed diversion, splendid! Shame such talent should end like this. Of course, only the greatest talent survives, Major. (gasps) Oh, no! -Don't! -(gun fires) (grunts) (gun fires) ("Pia's Theme" sung by Olivera Vuco)
