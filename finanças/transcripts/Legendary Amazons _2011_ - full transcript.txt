Go back home! Go back home! Brothers! Today we can ignite the soul-tracking lights for them. Who can do this for us tomorrow? Then just let our souls protect the border for ever! Shoot. Kill then. Brothers! Charge! Charge. Charge! Guiying. I shall break the promise of living and dying with you together. Take care of Wenguang. Catch it. Shoot. Great. Bingo! Marshal. The pigeon is safe. Come on. Don't leave me. "Muk Guiying, Greatsword Swordsman" Bodhisat, please send Zongbao back safely. Please bless Zongbao. Do bless Zongbao. Where I am, there is your hair. Zongbao. "18 years ago" Go. Go. Yang Zongbao! How can you call yourself a hero since you bring so many soldiers here. Liao intruders have set up the Tianmen Formation with witchcraft, resulting in huge loss of Song soldiers. Only your 'Dragon-taming Wood' can break down the formation. Win me first if you want Dragon-taming Wood. Lady first. What I chop next time will not be hair. Where shall I strike you next time? The outcome is clear. Miss Muk, I know you're not willing to rebel, and I don't want to bring down the mountain village. If you surrender and present the Dragon-taming Wood. I'll ensure with my own head. the whole Muke Village will be safe and enjoy a peaceful life. No results seen today. Let's continue to fight tomorrow. Uncle. Do you really agree to present Dragon-taming Wood and surrender. Your father proclaimed himself to be King due to compelling factors then. I wanted to persuade you to dismiss the brothers earlier but there was no proper chance. Since the Yang family troop has the meaning, why don't we follow suit? I also don't want my brothers to be robbers all life. Bur, can Yang Zongbao believe in this? We can judge him to be a trustworthy person in view of his behavior today. Once we surrender, our lives are grasped in their hands. What shall we do if the court break the word and doesn't let go of our brothers? Only when you're safe can your brothers be safe. One night has passed, what's your plan? I've thought for one whole night... and decided... to capture you! General! General! What shall we do? Muk Guiying! Your nature is incorrigible. How... How could you name yourself a hero. Release me. I'm not a hero at all. I'm a defeated general. Just give your sentence as you like. Calm down! I'll not kill you. I want you to be my husband. Be your husband? Listen carefully! Only when I am safe can my siblings be safe. For your siblings? Right! Zongbao, I've lost you. I can't lose Wenguang any more. "Tianbo Yang's estate'" "Daniang, Bagua two-ends lancer" "Maiden name, Zhou Yunjing" "Erniang, Twin Sword Swordsman" "Maiden name, Geng Jinhua" "Erniang, Greatsword Swordsman" Erniang, what are you writing? I can see no word. This is called sealed book. Got it. Look at your face! Sister, come over, take a look! The general's offspring inherits the loyalty spirit of three generations... It's your turn now. Sure! "Sanniang, Archer" "Siniang, Twin Hammer Wielder" Come on! "Wuniang, Sword Breaker" Grandma, can this really fly? You'll see for yourself soon. Now, we can fly them. Yup. "Bajie, Swordsman" Let's make a big one next time, and fly to meet the goddess in the moon. Meet the goddess of the moon. Well, the big wind will blow you away to meet Zongbao in the border. - Come on. - Yes. "Qiniang, Swordsman" "Jiumei, Swordsman" "Yang Jinhua, Lancer" Taste my magic. Wanna know what I've invented? Catch me and I will tell you. Fine. Tell me. It will be useful for my father in coping with Western Xia troops. "Liuniang, Niddle wielder" Liulang. Our grandson is 18 years old today. Though I gave him the name of Wenguang. Hoping him to follow the literature career. I have not forgotten your unfulfilled wish. While teaching him literature. I also passed down your '84 forms of spear skills' to him. Here's Mu Guiying. Dear ancestors. Today is Zongbao's birthday. It's also the adult ceremony of Wenguang. I hope that you can bless Zongbao in safety. And let him return triumphantly asap. Do bless Wenguang to succeed in the government examinations. have a bright future in official career, adding luster to the family. Well, the court cares politics more than military merits. It is suitable for Wenguang to follow the official career helping the emperor eradicate the evil and enrich the country. Liuniang, you are wrong. Good morning, Taijun! It is true that the court gives preference to politics over military merits. The official circle is just like the battlefield. All parties play tricks against each other. It is no safer than the battlefield. As they saying goes, to accompany the emperor equals to living with a tiger. The danger is no less than that in the battlefield. "Taijun, Staff wielder" Nowadays the border is in danger. As citizens of Song, Yang Family's men should fight in the battlefield. If Wengguang simply abandons military mission but chooses politics, the Yang's ancestors will not permit it! Master. Wow, what a big hole! What on earth is the matter? Yes, madam. It's Master Wenguang... He blew up the wall and ran out without permission. Amitabha, please bless Wenguang. He always sneaked out to play by climbing over the wall. What's the point of exploding it today. My brother must have stolen Grandma's fireworks. What kind of fireworks. Uh, so powerful? It can spark brilliantly when projected to the half sky. It is very powerful! Ah, wonderful! Zongbao can use it to cope with Western Xia. This firework is not used to kill people, but is to go with my water timer to activate today's birthday banquet. Here comes Taijun. Morning, Taijun. Taijun, Wenguang went out of this hole. Have some people gone to get him back. I'll go find him, now. No, sister, you've over-indulged in him. Let me go instead! Taijun. Don't worry. Though Wenguang is naughty, he is reasonable. He'll come back himself before tonight's birthday banquet. Don't be so assertive! Qiniang, go for him at once. - Go at once! - Yes! Qiniang is back! Taijun, we've searched every corner of the city, but found no trace of him! Lord Fan is coming. Welcome, Lord Fan. Taijun, all Yang ladies! Don't be overly courteous. I've come without invitation due to an urgent matter. Please pardon me. Is it related to Zongbao...? Right you are! An urgent report has come from the border today. Tianmenguan is lost. Marshal Yang has... Please go on! He has been wiped out. Infanta! Are you OK? Infanta! Why? Mom! You said Father is capable of fighting. How could he be wiped out! Grandma, you're a vegetarian and chant to the bodhisat every day. Didn't you pray for my dad. Why didn't the bodhisat bless my dad? Jinhua! If we beg the bodhisat... and she satisfies all our demands, the bodhisat is too biased. Then you chant sutra day and night... For what? Coming back! Coming back! Little master is back! Taijun, all grandmas, Mom! Take a look at my new horse! What's wrong with you? Dad is gone! Gone? No kidding! Mom! Is it true? Mom! Did you say Dad is the matchless God of War? How could the God of War be gone. Taijun! Taijun! Did you say that Dad is very capable of fighting, and he wins every time? Taijun! How could Dad be gone?! Taijun! Grandma! Grandma! Wenguang, stop crying! Stand up! From now on, you can only shed blood, but not tears! There's no weak and tearful man in the Yang family. Wenguang! Read out the couplet presented by your two grandmas. The general's offspring inherits the loyalty of three generations. He serves for the royal tasks definitely showing four generations of heroism. Grand Tutor Pan, Lord Wang, and Assistant General Liu are coming! Here is Imperial Edict. Yang Wenguang and She Saihua, take the edict! I'm surprised to hear of the loss of border cities and troops. Hereby I shall apponit Yang Wenguang as Marshal, and She Saihua as Supervisor. You shall control 10,000 footmen, and be equipped with 30 war horses as the vanguard, to crusade against Western Xia. By the emperor himself! Only 10,000 people to confront 100,000 enemy soldiers. This is no Imperial Edict, but an order of going for death! You want to disobey the edict? So what? Infanta Chai! Though you have the imperial death-exemption certificate yet it is only for protecting the royal family! Yang Wenguang cannot enjoy this privilege! Lord Wang! My crutch was given by the former emperor. It can hit both fatuous emperor and treacherous officials! You... Please calm your anger, Taijun! It takes time to deploy soldiers. In view of the urgent situation, the 10,000 soldiers are only the vanguard. The main force will follow soon! The Yang family always puts national interest first! Please accept the edict! Wenguang, accept the edict! Yes, Taijun! Thanks for your great kindness! Your Majesty! Taijun and all Yang ladies, farewell! They are so malicious to let Wenguang become the marshal! Don't worry, Grandma. I will surely win! You're not alone. I will go with you! But family members are not allowed to accompany the army! Accompany? We're to join the army! Yes! We shall join the army! Yes! We shall join the army! Fine! Wenguang, challenge your grandmas! If you defeat them, you can go to the battlefield! Compete with grandmas? I... I'm concerned for the safety of them! Just let Paifeng compete with me! OK! Whoever loses the weapon is the loser! Go ahead! I'll go fight in the border. Don't stop me! Infanta is overseeing us. Let's put on a verisimilar performance! Got it! I win! Paifeng! How could you let him beat you deliberately! I dare not! Huh, Grandma! Even though I'm not the best, I can still lead the troop! What matters in the battlefield is intelligence, but not kung fu! Mom! Wenguang is right. His intelligence, coupled with our assistance, can surely defeat the enemy! Taijun! In the past several decades of Song Dynasty, we just see unimplemented regulations and crafty people everywhere. Loyal people have no approach to serve the country! The Yang's several generations have faught bravely in the battlefield, but the result is simply a chilly picture of lonely widows and helpless tears! Liuniang! As you know, even without the Imperial Edict the Yang family will still go in for the battle. It is a compelling obligation for a warrior! What's more, imperial edict is above all, and military order allows no disobedience! But, Wenguang is the last man of the Yang! Since he has no other choice, please allow me to be his armor. I'll spare no effort to protect the last hope of the Yang! Please satisfy my wish! Taijun! Me, too! Taijun, the same with us! Fine! Let's go to the battlefield together! Thanks, Taijun! Come on! Miss Paifeng, do you really want to raze it off? How could I find time to do up my hair in the battlefield? Bald head is convenient! How ugly bald head would be! Yeah! I'm not afraid of losing my head, let alone shaving it! Then I'll shave, too! You? I'll also go to the battlefield to kill Western Xia intruders! Me too! - Me too! - Me too! We'll also shave! I'm an honorary daughter of Taijun, so it's my obligation to shoulder the risks with the Yangs. But you... need not venture your lives! Though I'm not a member of the Yangs, I'm a citizen of Song! Right! So we should also try to protect our motherland! Right! All right! Sisters, if we can't kill the enemy, we shall never grow long hair again! Ok! Miss Paifeng! Have you filled in the iron sand? Done! Filling in iron sand? This iron stick is half filled with iron sand. Though it's heavier than usual, yet the strength will focus at the top and become much more powerful than before! "Lift head and raise eyebrow imposingly." "Don't be a slave of fate." "Who can confront the Yeungs?" "How powerful!" "Cold moon smiling at frost and snow," "Encourage each other till dawn." "Phoenix born in fires." "Fly high." "Deep yard and high wall," "The wind being heart-broken," "Aroma of love cannot be retained." "Girls in armor," "Fragrance shakes the battlefield." "Forget the mortal feelings." "Endless love spurs me in the battlefield." "Brave heart fears no ups and downs of life!" "Lift head and raise eyebrow imposingly." "Don't be a slave of fate." "Who can confront the Yeungs?" "How powerful!" Enemy! Protect the marshal! Go! Go! Charge! Kill! Where're they? Seek! Seek! Fine! Dad! I will kill all the enemies. Please keep at ease in the paradise! Stop! Report! Chief Commander! We've found the camps of the Song troops. We may get there tomorrow noon! Noon? Pass my order: 30,000 light cavalries speed up with me. Other heavy armor groups keep going at the current speed. We'll give the Yang family troop a big surprise after the sunrise! Yes! The enemy arrives in advance. It not only restricts us in time, but also keep us far away from the expected battlefield. Thus, we'll not be able to follow the combat plan made by the emperor! No problem! Deploy the Routing-Enemy Overall Formation so as to utilize our infantry's advantages! No! This formation is only for battles on the plain between equal parties. I suggest we avoid the enemy's main force, break up the whole troop into parts, and fight a guerrilla war! Fine! I'll divide the troop into five divisions. Wuniang. You lead two followers are responsible for scouting. Zou Erniang. You lead 1,000 soldiers to distract the enemy's left wing. Geng Erniang. You lead 1,000 soldiers to distract the right wing. Siniang. You lead 1,000 soldiers to secretly attack their provisions in the rear. Guiying, Marshal, Qiniang, Paifeng, You lead 1,000 soldiers to launch an ambush attack in proper time. I shall lead the remaining 6,000 soldiers to meet the enemy at the frontline. Our goal is one killing ten, however we must fight a quick battle! Yes! Sink of swim, we'll meet at Huangtu Town! Yes! Here! Quicker! Good! Miss Paifeng, how many enemies can this bomb kill? None! Then what's it for? Tell us! It can release smoke to cover our withdrawal! Brothers! Today we shall launch the decisive battle against Western Xia! We have no choice but to win! Win! Quicker! Quicker! The enemy is coming! Yin Qi?! Pause! I heard that the Yang family is full of widows. Too wretched! I'll do a good deed today. If all the widows come to be my wives, I shall not only exempt your death, but also let you lead... a happy life every day! Shoot! Protect our marshal! Protect our marshal! Shoot! Bring out the prisoner! My father's helmet?! Seems like it! Zongbao? Stop! Dad? Zongbao's helmet? Guiying, what shall we do? Calm down! Don't stop me! I'll go rescue my father! Generals and Soldiers! Follow me to rescue Commander Yang back! Please think twice, marshal! We can not act recklessly before the main force takes action! How can I just watch my father being killed? That's not you father. It's only a trap! Why cannot it be my father? Are you sure?! I'm sure! Listen clearly, widows! Yang Zongbao is in my hand! I'll roast him. A roast lamb of Song! Set fire! No! Liuniang! Calm down! Liuniang! Cool down! Liuniang, don't mess things up! Zongbao! Calm down! Taijun, don't stop me! Let me save Zongbao! Go on! Roast him slowly! Take your time! It's a trap! Don't be trapped! Taijun, don't stop me! I'll go to save Chungbo! Don't be enchanted by the enemy! Can you bear seeing Zongbao burnt death?! He is not Zongbao! Mom, do you really want to stop me? Yes, I do! I won't let you take this risk, and won't let you put the whole troop to danger either! Well! Then, don't blame me please! Assistant General Yang! Yes! I order you to take down Commander Mu at once! Want to take me down? Please do it yourself! Well? You dare not? Who said that? Come on! Mom? Paifeng! Take Wenguang back to Taijun for monitoring! Yes! The situation is urgent! I'll take charge of the marshal seal temporarily. Switch the flag at once and keep all plans unchanged! Yes! Report! Marshal Yang is rushing to the enemy himself! Wenguang, don't go! Don't stop me! I'll rescue Dad! - Qiniang! - Yes! - Report to Taijun immediately! - Ok! - Bowmen, ignite the arrows! - Yes! Shoot! That must not be Chungbo! Look! Wenguang is out of control. Guiying has usurped the marshalship. Wenguang's gone to save Zongbao himself. Taijun! What shall we do? Wenguang? - Daniang! - Yes! Bring half the soldiers and accompany Qiniang to reinforce them right away! What?! Taijun! With only half force left, how could we defend the Western Xia cavalry's attack? Taijun, use the Empty City Trick! Charge! - Dad! - Who's your father! Who are you? This bitch has also come for death! - Who are you? - Wenguang, Get on the horse! Master, get on the horse! Move! Shoot! Arrow shower is coming! - Baixue! - Wenguang, quick! Move! Quick Take care! Protect the madam! Master, be careful! Yangchun! Damned bastard! Sorry, Mistress. We're late! No! You're right on time! Come, let's go battle! Arrow shower is coming! - Golden-roof Defending! - Yes! Wolf-fang Sticks are coming again! - Arhat turns over! - Yes! - Crescent Moon Formation! - Yes! Kill! Guiying, Taijun has retreated! She sent us to help you retreat! No more fighting? More fighting? Get on your horse! Kill! Retreat! Kill! Search! No people! Burn it! Yes! Shoot. Grandma. Come on. Charge. Zongbao, I knew you would bless Wenguang. Miss Paifeng. Daniang! Shoot! Grandma. Daniang. Black demon. Wenguang. Kill. Shoot. Guiying, come with me right now. No! I must take Wenguang with me. Mistress, go please! More enemies are coming. But Wenguang. Entrust Wenguang with me. Go please. Guaiying! We cannot do without a marshal. Get on your horse! Go. Shoot. Wenguang. Master. Master. Master. Kill. Damn it! The enemy is coming! Go quickly! No, I'll rescue Wenguang. - We cannot get down. - How could we! I must rescue Wenguang! I want to rescue Wenguang! Please go! Wenguang. Kill. Commander, the main force of Song played the Empty City Trick. They have already run away without trace. Song's marshal Yang Wenguang has been killed. Mu Guiying has escaped with less than 3,000 soldiers. Surely we will win. The main force played the Empty City Trick and escaped. Search for machines that shoot large arrows in the Song camp right now. Yes! Alas! Why are there wars. So many people died on both parties. Why are there some female soldiers dead. Hey! Brothers! Rest in peace! Go home! Sisters! Rest in peace! Go home! Brothers! Rest in peace! Oh?! Golden spear?! - How handsome the armor is. - I want the helmet. Quick! Climb up to save him! Get up! Get up! I'm too fat! Little Zhama! Little Douzi, climb up! OK! What do you want? Save your life. Little Douzi! Are you OK?! No problem. How miserable Qiniang's death was today. Daniang's death is more valuable. She killed so many enemy. Can we call it a failure this time. We're the Yang's female soldiers! Never say die until the last moment. Right! Never say die. Sister. Are you crying? It's me that has failed at protecting Master Wenguang. How could I face up with Taijun. Infanta and Madam Guiying. Are you missing Wenguang? I think his character is like yours somehow. When Yang Yanzhao couldn't conquer Liao Kingdom's 'Tianmen Formation', he sent Zongbao to borrow 'Dragon-taming Wood' from you. However, you two got married in the battlefield. Spare him. How come you're here? For you of course. I'll go and reason with your father. No. I cannot bother you with my own matter. I have informed the marshal that so long as you present Dragon-taming Wood. Your siblings will be safe! You're silly! How could you protect my siblings without keeping your own head. What I promise, I mean it. Fine! Just because you keep your promise and we're married. I'll protect you even if I have to lose own life. - Wait for me! - But... You said this marriage... is just for your siblings. I'll trade with you with my whole life, is that OK. This is our treasure: Dragon-taming Wood. Marshal Yang! I'm here to exchange Dragon-taming Wood for Yang Zongbao's head! Miss Mu, Yang Zongbao committed three capital crimes! I don't care! The Dragon-taming Wood can make up for Zongbao's faults. Please release him at once. Miss Mu's contribution can only exempt his fault of staying out all night. He missed two days' roll calls. What will you do?! I'll fight instead of him, making contributions to offset his crimes! If you win, I'll exempt another punishment! Then, what about the marriage in the battlefield. I swear to break through "Tianmen Formation". Will that do? Miss Mu, since you fight instead of Zongbao, you'd exchange his head with the enemy general's head. A promise is a promise! General, this strand of hair. Shall I help you return it to Miss Mu. When we fought last time I slashed it down! I'm reluctant to throw it away! Since you like it that much, just keep it for life! I'll take care of it all my life! Where I am, there is the hair. OK, no more thoughts! It's better to cure your arrow wound asap. We couldn't do without a leader! I've fed you for so many days, but you're still so thin! Kill! Kill! Enemy soldiers. Kill! Kill! Kill! Why don't they kill enemies? Of course not. Because they are not real Song and Western Xia troop at all. Who are you? We... are your savior. Oh! Why are you still standing here? Go to meet your father now! My father! This is the Chief Commander of the Westward Expedition - Yang Zongbao! - Right. Wenguang. Even since Little Douzi brought you back together with the golden spear. I knew it was you. Dad, I've met you at last. How about your mother, grandma, and Taijun? I lost touch with mom! Dad! I lost the battle! Why are you here? It's a long story. Thanks to Little Douzi's grandfather, and her clansmen! Marshal Yang! Get on board. Want to run away? Are you all right, forefather. General Yang, here's the whip! Catch them! Catch them! Patriarch! Patriarch! Are you ok?! Patriarch! Are you ok! Are you ok! Grandpa! Forefather. Why do you risk your own life to save me! General. I entrust my granddaughter and clansmen to you. You should lead them to serve the country and kill the invaders resolutely! Grandpa! So you decided to stay here. But why not sent a message to the family. I'll surely send a message after winning battles. Failures are common in wars. Failure should not be an excuse for not reporting safety to home! Tianmenguan was lost. All were dead except me. I blurred the Yang's reputation. So I'd rather let everybody think I am dead. Is reputation so important. Reputation, for a soldier, is more important than life! Dad! you're wrong. Your safety is more important to Mom and all the grandmas! They have been ceaselessly facing the deaths of men in the family. They've been hurt utterly. They cannot be hurt any more! Wenguang! My grandpa said not everyone can abandon the family to save the nation! Who doesn't want to live with their family happily. So you shouldn't blame General Yang any more. Wenguang. Thank goodness you had a narrow escape. Hope your mother can protect your grandma and Taijun to get out of danger! My Mom, she... I'm sorry for Mom! What's the matter? I broke into the enemy's camp recklessly which pushed Mom to usurp the marshalship and change banner. What!? You... Usurping the marshalship in the battlefield is a capital crime! Any method to save her? Yes! Defeat the enemy! Redeem the crime with merits! Stop! There's an ambush. Follow me! Go! Go! Damn it! Lay a formation. Sikong? Sikong. Wuniang. Sijing! Taijun! Many Western Xia soldiers are lurking ahead. Please retreat first. Let me bring up the rear! Fine! Finish the battle asap! No lingering! See you in Huangtu Town! Don't let them escape! Kill them! Wuniang! I'll go protect Taijun! Ok! Taijun, follow me! OK! This way! Liuniang, it's up to you! Of course! Taijun! Ahead is the entrance of Wolf Cliff! There is no way out! Wolf Cliff? Taijun! Liuniang sent us to report safety to you. Liuniang has gone to investigate the landform. Taijun! Many enemy soldiers. Retreat asap! Taijun! Please retreat quickly! Western Xia soldiers are to set fireballs on the hill. OK! Let's break through the Wolf Cliff. Gosh! Taijun is in danger! No hurry! Calm down! Follow me into the cave! Yes! Report! The enemy has retreated into the cave! Good! Set fireballs! Take care! Be careful of fireballs! - Calm down! - Yes! Be careful of fireballs! - This way! - This way! Protect Taijun! You follow me! Hold on! Taijun, be careful! Quick! Follow up! Gosh! If this situation keeps up, Taijun will either be burnt or choked to death! What shall we do? Combat fire with fire. Hungry-Wolf Valley is indeed a deathtrap! Guiying! Got any method of escape? Build a bridge. Build a bridge? You two, take off your chain armour! Yes! Aunt! I weave a chain, and you shoot it over! Make a bridge! Good idea! Go. Calm down! It must be Bajie there putting out fire with fire! I've made it! Come on! Taijun! Taijun! There's not much time left! No hurry! We've got it, Finished. Taijun, we've bound it well. Zhuifeng, Zhuiying! Your turn! Yes! OK! Taijun! The iron chain is fixed! Just come over! OK! Man soldiers, forward! Climb onto the iron chains! - Pave a men-bridge! - Yes. Miss Paifeng! Liuniang! We're late! Paifeng! You're just in time! Fine! Good! Let me be the first to get over! Taijun! No! It'll prove no trouble for me! Taijun, take care! Taijun! Take care! Good! Good! Guiying! Lead them across the bridge! Yes! Go! Damn it! It is you that are making trouble! Come on! Kill her! Here, Come up! Danger! Go on quickly! Bajie! Go at once. If anything happens here, I'll shoot an arrow to make a bridge! Don't hesitate! Go quickly! Be careful! Come over at once, Sanniang! Go quickly! Follow me closely! Wuniang! Go faster! Quicker! Protect Taijun... Take care! Hold on! Grasp it closely! I'm OK. Please find a way to rescue Wuniang. I've a method! Use my chain armour! Use my chest-arrow... toSave her! Wuniang! Hold on! Quicker! Wuniang, here comes the arrow! Take care! Hold it tight! We'll pull you up! OK! Pull! - Exert your energies! - Pull! - Exert your energies! Go on! - Pull! - Hold on! - Pull! - Go on! - Pull! - Exert your energies! - Pull! Pull! Taijun! Siniang is coming! Siniang! Good! Siniang! Infanta! Where's Taijun? Taijun and others are trapped within the Hungry-Wolf Valley. The odds are against them! Liuniang! Taijun is all right! Taijun! Taijun! Taijun! Please forgive us for not protecting you well! It's OK so long as you're fine! Get up please! Get up! Thanks! Taijun! Taijun! Please give me punishment! Daniang and Qiniang died! Wenguang is missing. Please punish me! Punish you! OK! One question for you! If you have the chance to make the choice again, will you still usurp the marshalship? I will! Trifles rely on public discussion, while big events are dealt alone! Since you're so resolute, I trust in your choice! You needn't blame yourself. The Yangs are full of loyal warriors. How could the Yangs have no offspring?! Taijun! You also believe Wenguang is still alive? Of course! We all believe that! We all believe that! Yes! We all believe! Guiying, are you ok? Taijun, Guiying received an arrow wound. Taijun, we cannot stay here long! Please move at once! Cure it asap! We cannot do without a leader like you! Yes! Stop. Stop. Report! Report: Yang Wenguang launched a rush advance, and Mu Guiying usurped the marshalship! The whole troop has collapsed! Mu Guiying usurped the marshalship? Sheer disregard of military discipline! She must be punished! Pass my word: Stationed on the spot! Await my order! Yes! Taijun is coming! Open the gate quickly! Taijun. When we arrived here yesterday, we found Song troop to the southeast of Huangtu Town. Song troop? Is Wangqiang coming?! Should be. They are holding the flag of Wang! How many soldiers did you see? Should be 100,000 or so. Report! Taijun! Zou Erniang... Let me report myself! Taijun, we disturbed the enemy's left flank successfully and fulfilled the task of one killing ten! It's a pity that... Geng Erniang has died a glorious death! Died?! Taijun! The situation is bad. Western Xia troops are marching towards Huangtu Town. What shall we do? Report! Assistant General Liu asks for an interview! Assistant General Liu?! Please! Taijun! Marshal Mu... Marshal Wang has led 100,000 soldiers to converge with Marshal Yang Wenguang. So he has assigned me... Wenguang is still alive? to invite you two to discuss the method of attacking the enemy! Please go back first. We'll take leave soon! Yes! See you there! Taijun! Guiying must not go! She'd be sentenced death due to her usurping the marshalship! Wang Qiang knows that we would not be trapped easily, so he takes Wenguang as the bait! My opinion is that we assert Guiying is severely wounded. I and Liuniang shall probe into the real facts there! Fine! Taijun! Since losing contact with Wenguang, I cannot sleep or eat well. Now we have his information, and the enemy is approaching. Time is pressing. True or false, so long as we can let Wang Qiang send troops in time, I'll not regret it, even in face of death, Marshal Yang! Many Song soldiers are ahead! They're holding the flags of Wang! Wang Qiang?! Wang Qiang is coming?! Lord Wang, where is Wenguang? Wenguang? You can meet him in the hell after enjoying your punishment! Report! Lord! Yang Wenguang is coming! He is still alive? Well Done! Usher him in! Good grandson! Grandma... How're you, Wenguang? Are you OK? Are you wounded?! Surely I'm OK! Taijun! Thanks to the blessing of the Yang ancestors! Mom! I was wrong! Nonsense! This is my military tent, but not the hall of Yang family! We should limit our speech to official matter now! The official matter? Lord Wang, please send troops to fight against the enemy now! Sending troops is agreeable, however, there's a precondition! What precondition? Execute your mother by yourself! Wang Qiang! I reckon you cannot execute Mu Guiying today! Now the situation is urgent. You didn't send troops with hideous thoughts. Now you don't discuss how to cope with the enemy in the frontline, but try to kill loyal generals! You're apparently destroying the defense and supporting the enemy! How dare you! Wang Qiang! Yang Wenguang! If you ignore the law and refuse to execute Mu Guiying, I will have you convicted also! Convict me? - I will execute you first! - Wenguang! The military law cannot be disobeyed! - Liu Fu! - Yes! Seize this assassin! - Attendants! - Yes! Whoever dares to hurt Yang Wenguang, taste my dragon-headed crutch first! - You! - Report! Marshal, Yang Zongbao requests an interview! Weren't his troop utterly annihilated? Mom, please rest your heart. Dad is not dead! Let him in. Zongbao... Mom! I'm sorry. Zongbao! Is it a dream? Are you still alive? Taijun. - Zongbao is not dead! - Grandma! - Look! - Zongbao?! I'm sorry! Zongbao! Please forgive my disobedience! I've disgraced the family reputation! Zongbao! It's OK so long as you're living! Yang Zongbao! Since you're alive, why not report to the court! Lord Wang, you have 100,000 soldiers, why didn't you reinforce me in past several months? You sent the whole troop to lost! Good! Well said! I will not compel you! If you want me to send troops, you should either execute Mu Guiying who usurped the marshalship or execute the assassin Yang Wenguang! Observe the law or not, The choice is in your hand! Zongbao! I have no regret to see you again. Give the verdict! Execution! No! Fine! Why do you say "fine"?! Of course I do! Yang Zongbao has implemented the military law, putting righteousness above family feeling! Once it is spread out, it will become a much-told story again after Marshal Yang Yanzhao! You... How I will die, under the hand of executioner or in the battlefield, is my own choice! You want to rebel? I was once a cateran, remember? Zongbao, let's go! Seize Mu Guiying! Execute her at once! Yes! Guiying! Who dares! Grandma! Our own people! Our own people! Mistress, go quickly! Madam Yang, please go with us! Spy! Liu Fu, chase after them! Yes! Liu Fu! Do you want to rebel! I dare not! I just want to stay here to protect you! Just in case of accident! Well, Yang Zongbao! You dare to collaborate with spies and release the criminal? Even if I don't execute you, the emperor will have you executed when I report this to his highness! I deserve a capital punishment indeed! Please keep your word and send troop immediately to combat the enemy! Sending troops is OK! However, you must catch the criminal Mu Guiying first. Or, all is worth nothing! OK. I will set out at once! Wenguang, Mom, and Grandma, let's go together! No daydreaming! You can only go by yourself. The others must stay here waiting for your comeback! You... Just go! Zongbao! We'll be here waiting for your safe return! Zongbao! Do you still remember the words you spoke to me in the evening when you were leaving for the battlefield after we got married? I remember that I told you... to look at the moon when you miss me! What did you say before 'moon'? I said 'stars'?! It was just Chinese Valentine's Day. The galaxy in the sky was very clear! I asked you not to worry about me. I said I am the God of War. I will come back to you after victories, even if we just meet once a year. But have you kept the promise of coming back to me each year? Zongbao! Don't feel guilty! I'm not complaining. Not everybody has the opportunity to sacrifice his own family happiness in order to protect the country. I feel very proud of you! I'm honored to be your wife! I'll be the woman behind you forever! I've been cherishing a dream: If I cannot spend my live with you, I'd rather die with you together in the battlefield! Wonderful! This dream comes true today! I feel very relieved suddenly! Let me see you again clearly! Let my eyes be satisfied! Or, I might not recognize you in the next life! Report! Speak! Marshal! Western Xia's 70,000-soldiers have converged with Yin Qi's 20,000 cavalrymen. They are marching towards Huangtu Town, and will arrive after noon! Pass my order! Take action according to the plan. Yes! Grandma, can these chillies produce gunpowder? Of course not! Then, what are they for? They can let the ememy weep! One against ten? One against ten! We cannot die until we finish the task! Die? Cannot we win the battle?! We have destroyed all mangonels! Good! Take care, and play it by ear. Ok! Marshal! When shall we launch the attack? Wait. Wait? Wait for what? We have no supporting troop! Shoot! The pegs are stuck. Report! The mangonels aren't functioning. Son of bitch! Attack the wall directly! Attack! Guiying! Don't wait! We must wait! Bowmen, prepare! Shoot! Dodge! Attack! Mom! We can't wait any longer! We have no weapons to defend the town. No, we must wait! It can reduce casualties. Prepare! Shoot! Miss Paifeng, why not go outside to kill the enemy? What are we holding brooms for? Yes? What to wait for! Wait for the wind. Open the gate! Attack! Kill! Bowmen, prepare! Marshal, do we shoot our own people either? Shoot! Marshal, we have more people there than they have! That's why they can't afford it! Shoot! Wuniang, take care! Grandma! Kill them all! Guiying, we are outnumbered by them! If this situation goes on, we will lose! Then what shall we do? Capture Yin Qi first! Buddha palm formation? All generals and soldiers! We shall break into sections, and target at Yin Qi. Cut off his head, and we can end the war. - Understand? - Yes! - Ignite the lanterns. - Yes! What's that! What's that? Zhuifeng, Zhuiying, shoot! It is pepper! Charge! Kill! Bow machines!

Right you are! We're also the citizens of Song! Right. Song citizens, great! Kill them all! Kill! The fairy scatters flowers! Erniang. Zongbao Yang Zongbao, you'll be the next! Guiying. I said that I will die with you in the battlefield! OK, let's have a thorough fight! Report! Marshal, the battle has commenced fiercely at Huangtu Town. Mu Guiying is leading all soldiers to fight outside the town. It seems that the odds are against them. Let's see how the Yang female generals carve their names in history! You're so sinister and ruthless! Didn't you hear the agreement between me and Yang Zongbao? I'll assign backup troops as soon as he finishes that task! Great Grandma! Grandma! Do we have to wait for Mom's death here, but do noting?! Is reputation so important for the Yang family? Great Grandma! Listen! I have the death-exemption certificate from Emperor Taizu. Now I have taken down this incapable marshal, All liabilities are on me, having nothing to do with the Yang family! Taijun, since we have no leader now, and the frontline is in danger, I'd like to beg you to take charge of the troop. The military token is here for dispatching troops. Please assign the troops at once! Liu Fu! Betrayer! I will not spare you! It is our Yang family that will not spare you! We're on the same side! We're not enemy. Report! Yang Wenguang is attacking our left flank with a large number of soldiers! Fine! Just let in Yang Wenguang himself! Seems that my arrow is more powerful than your spear! You! Dad, Mom. I'm coming with supporting troops! Wenguang! Great! Guiying, Wenguang is here with backup troops! We're sure to win this battle! Hold on, Guiying! All generals and soldiers: Listen carefully! Without my order, just hold on. I'll send him to hell by myself! Yes You... Bajie, we're on the same side! Own people! Wenguang, thrust at him! Dad! Dad! Wenguang, go and see Bajie! Mom! Take care of Dad! - Grandma! - Wenguang! Are you OK? Don't worry about me! Guiying! I owe you too much. Next life, I will... I will repay you!

Huaiyu Huaiyu You're one year old today! I'd like to let you make the choice yourself! If you choose this sword, you shall pass down our family tradition, and be a fearless warrior! Huaiyu Is it beautiful? If you choose this jade axe, Taijun will let you breach the family's tradition, allowing you to abandon military pursuit and follow political career! Take a look! Here comes Eunuch Li! Here is the imperial edict! In line with the God's willingness, I shall entitle Yang Wenguang as Assistant Marshal of Westward March.
