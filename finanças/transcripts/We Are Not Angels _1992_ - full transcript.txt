Ready? I've never read a nicer suicide note. Go on, jump, it's not high. Don't, it'll be alright. Jump, you pussy! You might even fly. 1:0! - He'll survive. - But only if he's crippled. 1:1. - Next. How romantic! - Romantic, my arse! A drunk guy doing push-ups on a stupid girl. That's fucking. Making love. - What? - Making love. - Screwing! Making love. - Banging! - Making love. - Humping! Making love. - They're not making anything. He only brought her to get her drunk, then never see her again. Oh man, how I love today's youth! Bye, Nikola. This is the beginning of a wonderful, new romance. We'll see. I agree you're handy with sperm, but that's not love. You'll see. - You don't mean a baby? WE ARE NOT ANGELS Sleep well? We were wild, remember? Hi, I'm Nikola. - I'm Cherry. Super, the omelette is almost ready. All those models at the party were peasants! My phone number. Did I tell you I was a top model in Milan? Call me, so that we can go raging tonight. - I will. Scram! Hear that Kursturica stopped filming in America? - Shit, really? I've got exactly 16 minutes to have coffee with you. Maybe 20. Get in here! - What a moron! Now that I'm a grown-up, I've got a job. What's the point of nightlife, alcohol, raging, women, drugs? What did I miss out on last night? - Nothing. I'll always be an adolescent trapped in the body of an adult. A model? I love the crazy ones. Every women is a work of art. How's Martha? - Cane's moving in. - I'm a patient man, you'll see. Here he comes! Did I tell you what we did in '68? How's it going, Nikola? Still up to no good? Take me sometime. My brother-in-law is a lost case. Let's have a drink. - It's too early. - Come on! Get up, yuppie, it's time to go. - I'm off. Hey mate, I love your bag! What's wrong with it? It's even got a lock. He was such a cool guy. Then he got a job. In '68, I swore... - You'd never wear a tie or get a regular job. Julia threw-up again! - I made a mistake with this third child. I'm coming! I found you a buyer for your video cassettes. Roll this and I'll join you when I get back. Milan, come here! - Coming! Hi! How do you like my hairstyle for my diploma? She doesn't like it either. - There goes my diploma. What are these? Pregnancy tests. Look, they're all pregnant. You're pregnant? What are you looking at? Marina... Marina, you have to do it. Give me his phone number. He has to take moral and financial responsibility. Moral? - Start thinking about the financial side. Do you know how much it costs? - What? - You know. Hi, let's go! - Come on, Marina! - You said I could drive you home! Have you ever heard of contraceptives? Why didn't you tell him to put on an IUD coil? Just drive! You think I'm angry? Get out of here! This is my jacket! - Stay out of this! I don't know what's wrong with her. You insect, what's this? - I told you, my mother. In a colour photo? You lying bastard! Sorry, I slept with your mother. - Give me that! He's your first boyfriend. - Second! The petting with Sini?a doesn't count. - Okay, first. You're only 18! How could you even think of that? It's as if someone whispered in my ear. It tingled here. You're crazy! Get in! - Ljubinka, you don't understand. Stop babbling! Just get in! Are you getting in or what? Get in! Nikola, come here, please! Bubi, I simply adore him! Adore, who forbids you. But what has that got to do with that! Marina? I can feel the tingling again. Let's go! Mum! Mum! Don't worry, mum Don't worry, mum All is going by the plan Bubi, I really want his child. for a month or two, for a month or two, for a month or two, I'm coming out! Out of the stomach! Out of the stomach! Marina, stop this! Chill out! It will look at you with it's big eyes and say: "Mum!" So that's what the maternal instinct looks like? Hey kids, feel like a fast ride? I've had a terrible night, so just tell me what's wrong. He's awful! I don't have proof, but I know he has other women. I think I'm in love. Bubi, I adore his laugh. We're not kids. You, in love? Yuk! Nicky! Honey bunny! I forgot that today I have to get rid of this idiot. You know I'm scared of Mr. Dentist. You promised you'd hold my hand. - Wait in the car. How is it that I never fall in love? Because all your girls are slightly mentally retarded. I'm just being precautious. You don't need Cane. He spends all day in the bathroom. - And leaves hair on the soap. That's my girl. Iron my black shirt, please. See you later. I don't understand why women love you. You're a lush, irresponsible, and you treat women like animals. I think that last point is crucial. This is where he lives. - He's the father? That's terrible! Why? - He shows a chick a pack of cigarettes and says: "As long as I have these, we're together." There's at least fifty gorgeous chicks after him. Isn't it lovely? Nicky! Not good! She's one of the top five chicks in town. He father is a writer and her mother is a famous model. Luckily, she inherited her mother's brains. Watch this! Are you Nikola's girlfriend? - Yes. He's just received an inheritance and has to go to Rio. He told you to go home, now. - I don't believe you. Nicky! She thinks, after all. She looks so silly, she must be in love. I know how she feels. - That I don't doubt. Marina? Have we met before? Nicky, will it hurt when I go to see Mr. Dentist? - Of course. He doesn't love me. Of course he does, he's just faking it! You know what it means when a guy doesn't recognise you? To quote Barbara Sidney: "A real women hunts big game!" This is our last hope. You're the first person ever to see this. Everyone thought I was keeping a diary. BELGRADE'S FAMOUS HUNKS While other girls were collecting dolls, this was my hobby. What do you think? You think it's silly. This poet has a daughter and now he has a son. Many of them didn't wait for me. He's married. - Now divorced. There are still plenty available. That means you've got... Nikola is in volume two. I've got a lot of information on him. You've just made me feel like the world's biggest scum. Are you glad? Yes, I'm a bastard. Do you think breaking-up is easy for me, that I'm not hurting? Listen Violeta, I have to go on a trip. I've just inherited... Oh Nicky, I'm going with you to Rio. He doesn't like to talk about art or the meaning of life. Music, he likes Zappa. I'll find out what that is. Most important, his type of girl. Marina, what are your legs like? - So, so. How did you get him in bed when you're not his type? I think I know how. Knowing you get drunk on cola, you two would have got on fine. You didn't tell your best friend that you lost your cherry. I'll get angry if you don't tell me everything now. Remember that party you weren't allowed to go to? I didn't really want to go. - That's where it all started. Hi, Marina. Hi, Zorana. - You're hopeless. Let me introduce you to The Vampires. They're so cute! Thanks, some other time. - You don't know how to have fun. Bubi don't worry, the party sucks. Just listen to the music. ''Let's drug, let the eyes glowing'' See? Bye. You know how alcohol effects me. - You're every man's dream. Bubi, then I met his pearcing eyes and he said: "Little girl..." I've heard enough. - Then we went to his place and it was bliss. I've no doubt. Hey, is it true that he has a water bed? - No. The rest I know. You woke before he did and snuck out. Big mistake! He doesn't remember meeting you. - I was too embarrassed. We can't keep him drunk all the time. That means we'll have to work on your looks. - Why? Tomorrow you get contact lenses. Give me your retainer. - No way. I just want to see something. Look at me! I've lost a contact and I'm full of pimples. I can't see him like this! - All you need is a facial. I'll walk you to the door. I thought you said they split up? What a moron! What are you staring at? Hi. I brought what you asked for. - Let me see. Be careful, they're my father's. - All right. Have you decided what university you're going to? Me, electrical engineering. - Great, you're our idol. Leave, we've got work to do. - Bye. - Bye. You're horrible! He loves you. - He's a jerk! I need someone better, like Nikola. I'm only joking, he's your guy. Change of plan. Nikola, another of your uglies is waiting downstairs! Martha, tell her I'm not here! Nikola, I'm not your mother. Get down here! You crazy bitch! Hello, Nicky. - What is it? I've come to tell you. I'm going through hell! I tried to take my life twice! The third time will be fatal! Want me on your conscience? What am I supposed to do? - Make me your wife. Do it... as painless as possible. You'll pay for this! What promiscuity! - Your goose is cooked. Now what? - Sorry, Nicky. I'm back with Cane. This is the waiting cab, the entrance and tickets. This is where our enemy, Lidija, will pass. Try this on. Great! As Barbara Sidney says: "A woman with blonde..." Good evening, Uncle Yellow. - Hello girls. Ljubinka, my child, Daddy goes to War. Oh Dad, you're playing again. - That's what we're paid for. Good bye. - Good bye. - He's loosing it. Listen. This corridor leads to the ladies toilets. The cleaning lady leaves at 2. Nikola always sits here. Nikola, it's getting late. Let's go home. You know I have to work tomorrow. So? I'm also working, I'm creating. There he is. - Excellent, he's stone drunk. Nikola, please escort me to the powder room. Where did you find this uncouth creature? I'll take care of her and you go overto him. I want a drink first. - You know what happened last time. - I know. You're back already? Did you have a nice twinkle? Look at this next combination. Vodka... Excuse me, I'm locked in! ...two kinds of bitters, and crceme de menthe. First we drink, then our bodies will entwine in wild passion. At last... it works. He's all ours. Hey kid, you lost your hair! - Keep it, I don't have change. Shilja, check please! Now what? - Make sure your parents don't return. Leave the rest to me. Did you read Barbara Sidney's "Eyes of My Lady"? - I did. The guy and girl tattoo each other between their love-making. - Yuk! Don't worry, everything is under control. You're not Lidija, are you? Who are you? Who am I? - Your girlfriend. - What? I'm your girlfriend. - Really? I'm your girlfriend. I turned out well in that drawing. That's our baby. - Is that a joke from last night? If I drank cocktails, we might have made such jokes. You drew this two months ago. - You haven't bathed since then? Disgusting! What promiscuity! I'm your girlfriend! - You wretch. Where's my shirt? Don't ever mix your drinks. If you think I'm your girlfriend, then we should keep it. What? - Our baby. - Go ahead and keep it. Nikola, I really want your baby. I'm pregnant. - I'm Nikola. - Congratulations! What did she say her name was? - Marina... Eleonora, Ema, Ela... Eliminate her! What the hell's wrong with me? What is it? You showered together and there was only one towel. What's the time? - Fuck you, I don't work today. The force of habit. This is the only thing that hurts them. To bed, right now! ...and the other one came out from underthe bed? I envy you! You wouldn't believe what a cool guy my brother-in-law used to be. ...Don't hit them on the head! - Why not? Then what? - We screwed twice. I don't remember the first time. Actually, nor the second time. I don't even know her name. Fuck, I'm such a jerk! According to my calculations, she has ten days to decide. How do you know? - It's general knowledge. This is my reconstruction. Coitus took place in May, because that's when there were the most parties. How long does it take for a girl to realise the scary truth? I've no idea. - Not less than two months. It's the beginning of July and she's in herfatal third month. A decision must be made. - I think... She will make her own decision. See who I have to live with? One day I'm going to leave everything and go to Jamaica! I sold your cassettes. What's that smell? How many times have I told you boys there's no smoking here? Milan, come with me! - I'll be right back. It's a shame to waste. You're one crazy fucking bitch! He's coming and the place is a total mess! Bloody hell! She's in love again. Do you like it? It's disgusting! You'll never understand women. I think I'll marry Cane, and have five children with him. Do your folks suspect anything? No, they think I'm miserable because school is finished. When you're in your 9th month, they'll think you've overeaten. Parents are so gullible. As we won't be able to count on your looks, we'll have to work on... - The spiritual aspect. - Tactics! At least tell me why. Is it the baby? You got her pregnant?! Nicky, I was wrong. I was desperate. I wanted to hurt you. Now that I see you lying there so pathetically, I forgive you. I haven't introduced you. This is my new boyfriend, Rado?. - They call me Johnny. You've lost weight without my cooking. You look peakish. He's scum! You've got to admit, he's not too crazy about you. We have to play dirty: Trap him with a baby. I know it's not becoming for modern and well-mannered girls. We should be ashamed of ourselves, shouldn't we? - We should. We're ashamed! This is the plan. Yes, of course I remember you. How do you know that I like calamari? Dinner with your parents? That's taking a risk. Marina's parents are very nice people. He might like them, orthey might even like him. Marta! Get the tie! Oh, excuse me! It's nice to see a young man so casually dressed. - Yes. Marina told us so much about you. We couldn't wait to meet you. Nikola seems like a nice fellow. She had a fool of a boyfriend, a lawyer, but we didn't interfere. We let her make her own decisions. She wants a year off before starting college. Fine with me. Dad, please! - Be quiet! I bet he wore a pink tie and tried to be your buddy. Exactly. He always sweated and he seemed so feminine. A faggot, right? Pavle, please! I must admit, he was not as direct as you. He never slurped and it was so annoying! Children, I do admire you. Having a family today... What? - It's simply crazy. I agree. But it also takes courage, which I respect. Are you employed? - Nope, I just dabble on the black market. He's finishing university. What in? - World literature. - Excellent. I still have 12 exams. - Is that all? Don't worry, I'll ask around for a job. As you young people would say: No worries. What is it? You're tickling me. - I've got the situation under control. Look how I cut myself. That's because you're careless with works of art. Wow! I've missed out on something. Where's Cane? He's out of my life forever. How was dinner? I could never marry a girl whose parents eat plastic fruit. That's because you're a snob. - I am. And irresponsible. - And handsome. Above all, immature. That I am. I'm simply not ready. Do you know how many gorgeous women there are on this planet? Only one. - Djura, you're wonderful. Only a few 1000 more and then I'll settle down. I'm not ready yet, believe me. I still have the feeling that they're waiting just for me. Their little, twitching, brown noses. Combing their long, blonde hair. It's as if they're all saying... I'm hungry. I have to pee. - It's your turn to carry Suzana. You know I can't because of my back. It's almost dawn, like old times. Isn't the chick's name Sofija? You're dead if you ever take me to a kids' party again! You're the paedophile! - You liked spinning the bottle. Orwhen the girls hid their fags, thinking their parents had returned. Hey kid, wake up, we're taking you home. Rape! You already raped me! Listen little girl, just tell us where you live. Rape! Little girl. Go! Well? - I think we overdid it. What if they get him? - No way. My life is slowly turning to hell. All because of that baby. Everfeel a force following you and influencing your life? When my old man stopped my allowance and made me get a job. Is that a jersey? Hi, Stinker. - These gentlemen are in for? They raped a minor. Scum! Guard! I'm a nice bloke. I can't share a cell with these maniacs! I just can't resist. Hey schmuck, how about if this maniac kicks you in the balls? Hey schmuck, how... - What's wrong with you? Do you know what time it is? Criminals! Convicts! - The animal made me. Stop feeling so down. You used to be so cool, my idol. Ljudmila! From our gorgeous mailman. We all know who wrote this. Nikola, when are we going to finish that act? - Never! Martha, give me the letter! - Besides, you're getting too fat. A position for senior counsellor. -That's what I need. Her father's crazy! She's just like him. Why don't you get a job, marry and settle down. -Never! A man should decide for himself, not be blackmailed by a baby. Can you imagine me as a father and husband? Gross! Remember when you got Nevena pregnant? You were so drunk, you put the condom on your big toe. Then the following tactics. First, a literary evening. Then it was the opera, to see what a jerk you are. Then you went to the pool and accidentally met the moron, who was complaining that she was 35 kilos overweight. Nicky... - I can't have this baby, so Monday I'll go and... -Abort. That means? -The pool. No, a literary evening. Stick to the recipe. -You bastards! An experimental music concert. Sounds enticing, doesn't it? Yes. Little Marina. What a coincidence. I was about to invite you to a lovely concert. Where? Unbelievable! You're the first girl who isn't repulsed by boxing. Yes, between the "Bombers" and "Citizens". Sunday, of course. Bye. My money's on Skerlic. Joksimovic. -A good fight, isn't it? He has a good uppercut. -He does. Great fight, isn't it? That happens all the time. -I'm sorry, but I hate boxing. Let's go. I dig your chick. You must be a real sissy. Stay calm! 1,2,3,4... Don't do it. -Of course I will. 5,6,7,8... Let me carry her. -Get lost! She's a sure lay now, knocked out like that. I'm nothing but bad luck to him. I wouldn't blame him if he never saw me again. Yes? Nikola! - Be cool, ask what he wants. Yes... Do I have any free time? - Maybe next week. Of course. Where are we going? Be reasonable. It doesn't hurt, it's like going to the dentist. We can be lovers, travel, have fun. We're too young forthis. Look at it like this. Yourteeth will start falling out, and you'll get really fat. Yuk! Then there's cellulite, stretch marks, all kinds of complications. What if it's a Caesarean birth? You'll have to wear a tie to the beach all your life. This is what happened to a friend of mine at birth. It's a gruesome story, but you might learn from it. Next. -Excuse me, I just want to ask something. She's even dumber than I thought. I worry about her. Excuse me, did anyone see where the girl went? Bubi, can you feel it moving? I think it's time we left Nikola to decide for himself. Of course he'll decide on his own, we're just helping him. He's desperate because chicks are looking worse. Listen to the slut! He's not desperate, he's just living life to the fullest. She's hideous! -What do you mean? You can tell he didn't enjoy himself. That's a good sign. Marina! Excuse me partner, are you finished with Nikola? Sorry, I don't understand. - What don't you understand? It's 6.15, which means you stole 1/2 hour of my time slot. Don't let it happen again. From now on, all my time slots are available. -Thanks, sister. What's happening? - They still keep coming. I'll die if I have to spend another night in this car. We have to come up with a better idea. Here they are. -This is your better idea? How can I finish philosophy in one afternoon? It took you one morning to finish literature. Hi! -Oh, no! Look at Raca, he loves to study. Don't you? Can you quickly go through those books with her? -Yes. I'm constructing a radio station, but I still need... -Bye. We'll never make it. Radio Station! Raca! I can't believe you read "The Magic Mountain". You even like the same parts as I do. Unbelievable. Oops, stairs. Marina, that was great. You also like Hesse, "The Glass Bead Game". Next is Sellinger. Forget him, I don't know what he wrote. Marina, can you hear me? -Bubi, there's interference. I knew you'd screw up something. Marina, answer me. Talk about Marquez and Borges. Bubi, I can't hear you. -Talk about Marquez and Borges. Can you hear something? -No. Milan, Marquez and Borges sound suspicious. Raca, you're going to pay forthis. I've got a connection. -Marina, answer me! What music do you like? You probably like the latest hits. Marina, you're hopeless with music! Marina, what are you waiting for? Move on to Latin proverbs! You asked me what music I like. I'm not into this new stuff, I prefer, let's see, Zappa. I can't believe it! I simply adore Zappa! Do you know this one? Marina, you're the only girl who likes the same things I do. You're the most amazing girl... Let's go to a cake shop. This is terrible! We didn't even get to philosophy. Ourfirst date. We went to a cake shop and the cinema. We went for a drive. I've never had a nicer date. -Or a longer one. Listen Marina, you're pretty and smart. In some ways, you're even perfect. I could tell you all sorts of lies, but I'm simply not ready for this kind of life. Understand? I almost forgot. Happy birthday. -You're the only girl... For my car! Fuck off! Girls today, can't fuck enough. Are you sure the child is yours? Marina! -Yes, Nikola. Girls today... How do I know the child is mine? I didn't mean to say that. Hi, Chief! -Hi. -I've got great "Afghan". Know this whore? She's a great lay! Go stand overthere. She's so nadve. Stick to her type and you'll have no problems. I've got an hour before I return to my comfortable nest. Let's go in. -I'll see you inside. Get over here! Nikola, my boy, tell Nana what's bothering you. Nothing's wrong Nana, I'm just having fun. My love! Nikola, I'd love to do her! Madame, last night, did we... Three times. Did you hear that Kusturica will go on filming in America? -Great! Nikola, call me tonight and we'll have a great time! This one makes me look large. -Take all four, you'll need them. The wedding should be intimate, so that he's not scared off. What wedding? Let's get out of here! What's wrong now? After 3 months of hard work, he's finally ours. I mean yours. Marina, at least ask him. -No! You're like poor Vivian who worked 14 years in a bridal shop. Not once did she think that any of the gowns might be for her. Here's yourwad. Enjoy counting! You want me to propose? -We'll have fun. -No way! Look at that beautiful glow in her eyes. She'll do it. There isn't a woman who doesn't dream of a romantic wedding. I'll always love you. But miserably. - Go back! Be Brave! You can't fall any lower, Nikola. You have two paths ahead of you. You can't fall any lower, Nikola. You shit! That's true, you're a shit. Nikola. -Yes, Marina. -I've come to propose. Hag-fucker! You're proposing to me? -Yes. I do. -Louder. -I do. -Softer, more subtle. I do. -More decisive. -I do! No Milica, Nikola isn't here. He's gone on a very, long journey. I said he'd never be a real man! Faggot! Motherfucker! Daddy! Statistics say that people always come to their own wedding. Don't worry... -Shut up! That girl is really... I see you. Come here! You're crazy! Where's your wedding dress? Bubi, I can't marry him. -You came to spy on your wedding. Barbara Sidney never wrote anything like this. Actually she did... forget it. I know he doesn't love me. Despite everything, I don't want him to hate me. She is so incredibly stupid! Remember Barbara Sidney before she became famous? I'll never forgive myself! -You took her out of that brothel. Get dressed for the wedding. -I'm going to the coast. Marina will be waiting and this waiter here is your best man. Better I leave now, than during a row with my in-laws. True, but you deserve a beating. -Go on then. Come on Nikola, you're my best friend. See you later. It's over, he's gone to Lastovo Island. This is how you don't get married. Marina, I'm going to follow him to the island. Raca, let's go! Marina, I wasn't thinking of marriage. Would you? Some other time. Maybe it's all forthe best. Marry me. -Get lost, you faggot! Oh man, this is the life! Alone and free, just hanging out. No nagging wife, no screaming children. Freedom, man, freedom! Where can we get a Christmas tree? He's never going back! Raca, start packing! He was a great guy! - Sure, everyone's mourning him. So what, his life was full of joy. 1286 women! That's gotta count! Nicky! -Hi, Violeta. I'm not Violeta anymore. My name is now Brindavani and this is my husband, Govinda. We're going to India for Krishna's birthday. How about a welcome back punch? Welcome back from the longest summer holiday ever. Go on, ask. Marina, ask already. -What? Explain how Nikola spent 3 months at the coast without a single lay. Sea, wine, sun, guitars, and still nothing. I might be wrong, but there are more important things than men. Can you imagine me as a mother? -I don't know. Last New Year's Eve we were so drunk. I wanted to declare my love to Bajaga. (famous musician) We were such kids. -It'd be nice if you were with Bajaga. Nikola! - It's Djura, he's taking me for my check-up. Hi, Nikola. Thanks, I'm fine. No, I wouldn't like to see you. I know you understand. Bye. Marina, do you love him? -Maybe. It's all been a mistake from the beginning, expect forthis. I can't hear anything. He's stopped. I don't know what's happening. -Maybe he should go to her. Maybe I should go to hell. Djura, I want to have 5 children with you. -One to start with. You're so wise! Isn't this cute? Marina, snap out of it for just a second. In Barbara Sidney's "Southerly Winds of Passion", the heroine waits six years for her captain to return. And? -You're angry because he was away for only three months. But they're characters from a novel that always end happily. Some novels don't have happy ends. -That's not literature. When the captain returned, she put him to a test. We'll do that with Nikola. -You're crazy! Anyday now, I'll be a mother. I don't care about the captain. I've ruined everything! Me and Barbara Sidney! Bubi, it hasn't turned out so bad. If I'd aborted, I wouldn't get to see this tiny creature. We'll do it your way: We'll put the captain to the test. You'll see, Marina, he's a changed man. Guess who I just saw? Nikola will be at the club tonight. We have to find someone to really tempt him. What about Julijana Vlakic? -No way we can get her. She's my cousin. -Really? You're a genius! I waited and waited the whole day through, For you to return with love so true. I wait in vain to him I'm a jail, I'll wait and wait to no avail. Dearest, wait, return to me If you won't be mine You're friend will be. "I need to see you tonight. Marina". Well Nikola, happy New Year. Would you like a "disco death"? No, thank you. -No, thank you?! -I'm not in the mood tonight. Has a pregnant girl been here? -Never, we only have decent girls. If he turns her down, he's cured. This song always make me faint. Do you want to dance? You can bet I do. This was enlightening. Have you ever made love on a dancefloor? Have you ever made love on a dancefloor? What is it? -I think it's starting. These things happen in hospitals. -Please, call a taxi. Why don't you look where you're going! -You again! Excuse me, but I think I'm having a baby. Please, call a doctor! -Everything's under control. I remember the first sentence in the manual: Nature takes care of itself. Have a drink and we'll start. I'm sorry. What's this crap?! Come back, you slimey whimp! Look at the babe I got you! Why are you behaving like that? It's only a game. Come on, happy New Year. -Same to you. Congratulations. Do you want to see the baby first or a punch in the face? I just remembered; you're Marina, right? I love happy endings! Where have you been? I've just found... -Kiss me! What a kiss! He'll have your intelligence and masculinity. Who? -Our son. Look! Where do you think you're going? No way! To him, science is more important than any baby. Wanna bet? - The usual. Let's go. I'll kick his arse this time! How babies are making, of sugar or dreams? I came to ask you, if you know something about it Is it stork one who bring babies, or they incubated from the heads of cabbage? Tonight we are more and more close to the truth, my heart is bangin' faster, it's already half past two, How babies are making, who bring them? and why you turning lights off, c'mon, tell me? How babies are making, you showed me, something I wasn't know, is that it's about love.
