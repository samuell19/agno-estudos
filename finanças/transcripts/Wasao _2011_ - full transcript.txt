Do your best! Akira! - Do your best! - Akira, they're coming! - Go! - Here they come! - There they are! Akira. Quickly! - Do your best! You can do it! - Do your best! - Do your best! Go! Go! - Do your best! - Go! - Do your best! - Go! - Good job! - Go! - Do your best! - Go! You can do it! - You can do it! - Do your... - Go! - Go! Go! - Shiro! - Do your best! - You can do it! - You can do it! Mom! Misako. Misako! Hey! It's your fault! Mom might die, you know! Go away! Just go away! - I'll see you. - Okay. Akira! I hate to give him back, but Akira is really upset. I see. How is Misako? Well, no change. Here, Shiro. Time to eat. Eat a lot, okay? Delivery! Coming. A box of fruit from Aomori. I'll just set it down here. Here, Shiro! This way! Yes! Shiro... Good boy. You got dirty. Gone again! What? Hey. That looks like a good catch, Hiroshi. So-so. Oh, my. Thanks a lot! - Kazue! - Yes? Give me a hand. - Okay. - Heave-ho. So-so? - Okay. - Maybe to him. Everyone has their own special talent, right? What happened to you? - You should talk! - What? Good morning! - Good morning! - Sayo! Sayo! Thank your mother for the grapes, will you? - Sure. - Okay. See you. - Off you go! - Bye! Hey. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. That's all I have today. Something tore up my field. What did that? I don't know. - What's wrong? - I don't know. Nancy! Good morning! Good morning, Akira. Where's Nagisa? She didn't seem too good this morning, so she's skipping her walk. I see. I'll drop by after school, then. - See you! - Bye. - Take care! - I will! Hiroshi should be home soon. Right on time! Hi there! Hi. How was it? So-so. So-so? Come on. Here we go. You're hungry, right? You'll love this. There. There. There, Monchan. Monchan? What? Weird. - Hey. - Hey. - Did you catch anything? - Yes. - You won't believe this! - No? Show me. Okay, here. What? Is that all? No, what you won't believe is... - I saw a lion. - What? A white one. Like the one in Jungle Emperor? No, meaner and uglier than that. - What? - A lion? - Yes. - Don't fall for Shigeo's stories. The more you do, the wilder they get. It's not a story! - Well, then... - Yes. If there was something out there and the media got hold of it, we would get some tourists and put some life in this town. Well, I'm all for anything - that will put life in the place. - Forget it! Here. This? Kazue, look. Shall we deep-fry it? - Hello. - Welcome. - A grilled squid, please. - Okay. That'll be 300 yen. Here you are. - Okay. - Yes. Thank you! Take care. Nagisa? Can't you eat? Let's see. Your nose. Hey. It's all dry! I'm going to Dr. Tanioka's place. Right. - Please look after the shop. - Okay. TANIOKA ANIMAL HOSPITAL Good dog! Very good! She's getting old. If anything happens, let me know. I will. What? What? A firecracker? She probably swallowed it with some dirt. What? Animals eat soil to replenish their minerals. - They do? - Here. So I hope everyone's careful to pick up after themselves. Good dog! She should be fine. Thank you. I'll check her stomach. Tatsuya! Hi, Setsuko. What a mess! It sure is. It threw around everything it could find. A bear? Maybe, or monkeys. It would take a big dog to do this. Something starving in the woods? Will you report it? I have to. - What a mess! - Look at all these. Just leave that. - What a waste. - It's fine. Hello! - Hi! - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! Pipi! What? Where's Nagisa? Didn't Setsuko take her for a walk? I see. Monchan! Monchan is going to have puppies! - What? - What? Are you sure? I've seen it before. You have? KIKUYA GOODS Setsuko! Are you here? It's us again! Sayo! Tomoya! Yohei! Are you all studying hard? Yohei is getting ready for high school entrance exams. Oh, my. Hirosaki High? Yes. - Hey. - Hey. That's a hard school to get into. It sure is. - Hey. - Hi. Hello. Is Akira here? There. Hello! Hello. - Akira! - Maki! Let's go see Mom. Okay. Monchan... doesn't want people touching her now. Okay. Bye! - Bye! See you tomorrow, Akira. - Okay! Bye, Akira. - Thank you. - Yes, bye. - Come tomorrow, okay? - Okay. See you! Bye! - Is Nagisa okay? - Yes. Don't touch her too much. She's pregnant and she'll get upset. Akira said that. Really? Is she sick? We just came back from Dr. Tanioka's. You did? Is she sick? Did you tell Akira about Monchan? No. He noticed it first. He said he has seen pups being born. Really? So Akira knew about it. GRILLED SQUID Here you are. KIKUYA GOODS - Goodbye! - Oh, Akira! - Bye! - Maki! Take care! - Bye! - Get home safe! It's a toss-up whether you're ugly or cute. Setsuko! We'll see you. - Take care! - We will! BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SECTION Two more fields have been ripped up just today. - There are a lot of wild dogs around. - Well... these seems to be some dog tracks. It didn't look like dog tracks. Probably deer or monkeys. No. A bear, maybe. A bear means real trouble! Do something, will you? Of course! We really just don't have anyone right now... Don't wreck the place! Yes, you're right. A woman who says she'll marry me might change her mind now. You're getting married? Congratulations... I asked her, but with this, she might not! If there's a bear, we can't have the triathlon. Sure we can! The triathlon will go ahead as planned. I hope you'll all help out. Help out? I can let off fireworks. There's no budget for that! We haven't had fireworks in years. No one does anything now. We can't just rot away. If we all do that, the town falls apart. If no one takes that first step, nothing changes. We should go in it. You're right! That's a great idea. You too, Mitsugu. Me? - The triathlon? - Yes. Yes, please! But we can't tell everyone they might run into a bear! We'll call a hunting club. People running around with rifles will scare everyone away. I understand how you all feel, but if something were to happen... I know someone. A traditional hunter. Twenty. - Twenty-five. - Okay, 25. - Twenty-five. - Okay, 25. Twenty. I see. It is a toss-up. - Twenty-five. - Twenty-five. Twenty. Thirty. - Twenty-five. - Twenty-five. Thirty. Twenty. Setsuko! Hi! - Hello. - Hi. You know a lot about the local animal life, right? I'm sorry? They say there's a bear around here. Have you seen anything? If it came anywhere near the beach, the dogs would go crazy. Have they all had their shots? Of course. I'm supposed to put down any wild dogs or anything I find. If it's a bear with cubs, will you still shoot it? Well, we'll try and chase it away first. Killing it is the last resort. - I'll see you. - Okay. We're all just doing our best to get by. Right? KIKUYA GOODS You want some? No? That big furry dog is quite something. He must be, to run away when you bring him food. Furry... He sure is! The Kikuyas are having pups. I sent Shiro to Tokyo. He must be pretty mad, right? Grandpa? Get in the house! Good morning. Thank you for coming. This way, please. Good morning. Come this way. - Here. - Yes. - Here, Kazue. - Okay. - Bears are scary. - Yes. But they've brought in a pro to get rid of it. I don't like depending on people to solve my problems. I'm not depending on anyone. A bear wrecks your field, and you leave it to others. It's not the same! Tatsuya, why don't you try that? The triathlon? The three old guys are doing it to help bring the town back to life. They are? They're people who knew the town when times were better. And people like us mean to stay here, right? I'm not moving away. I've got fields to look after. Exactly. Then you help out too. I'll tell you what. If you become the best in the triathlon, I'll marry you. SHIRAKAMI CUP 25TH AJIGASAWA TRIATHLON He'll be here. No, he won't. There! Eat! Nagisa! Nagisa! No! No! Yes! Wasao! That will be your name because you're furry. Okay? BEWARE OF BEARS Quickly! Quickly! - Good work. - Keep it up! - Go for it! - Good work. Good job. What's that? - A white bear. - No, it's not. Discretion is the better part of valor. Let's call it a day. - Yes. - All right. Time to go. We'll try again tomorrow. Tatsuya! You're working hard. My whole life is riding on this! His whole life? That's really something. I couldn't do that. Another three minutes and my life would've been over. Well, in ten minutes, we can have a beer at Naoko's. - Let's go. - Okay. Good thing I didn't drop dead. - Good evening. - Hello. What? That was Wasao, I'll bet. That white bear? - That's one big dog! - Yes. Which means... - I guess he likes it here. - Yes. - The dog does? - Yes. - I doubt it. - No. Maybe he does. And soon... - Setsuko? - Yes. She couldn't take in a dog that big. Sure she could. - What? - She could? She looks after three bigger ones. Wait, does she mean us? I guess so. He'll end up at Setsuko's. Yes. He's a funny-looking dog, but he's kind of appealing. - You're right! - Yes. Come in here. Hi, Sayo. What's up? Nothing much. I'm putting my name in. For what? One of the cram schools? For that. The triathlon? The festival. The one after the triathlon. - You guys do it too. - Us? We can make a great float, and be in the band too. I'll play the flute, and you can play the big drums. Who says you decide? That sounds like work! Then do the triathlon. And have primary-school kids beat me? No way! The festival, then. Oh, man! Akira, you make sure they don't slack off. Okay. I'll help too. Bring us some water! Nagisa! Are you still alive? Hang in there! You're older than we are. - Here you go. - Thanks. You want to come with me? - You're late! - Wait a minute! - They're waiting! Hurry it up! - Hurry! - Come on, run! - Quickly! - Hello. - Hello. Hi. You're going to play the drums? - Yes. - Yes. Right! Give it a try. Here. I'll say when. - Sayo. You, too. - Okay. Together. Now! Well, you made a noise. It's not from the arms. It comes from your back and hips. Okay. Watch me. SHIRAKAMI CUP 25TH AJIGASAWA TRIATHLON Hi! - Are you meeting someone? - Yes. Akira, would you like some squid? Thanks! - Hello. - Hi. - Those two are late? - Yes. - Monchan is a lot bigger. - Yes. You had a dog too, didn't you? Yes. Shiro. But he went to my aunt's. I see. It's sad when you have to be apart. Yes. I shouldn't have asked. We were always together, and I told him to go away. I don't know why I said that but I did. When that car hit Mom, I blamed Shiro. He was still a puppy, but... - Hello. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. You're late! You don't keep a lady waiting. Only Dr. Tanioka can do that. Bye! - Bye. - Bye. Bye. I'm told Sayo's parents are splitting up. What? It's in court now. - Hello! - Hi, Shige. Who's that? The hunter. There's another one. Where is it? What do you mean? I found this in a broken shed. Wasao wouldn't do that. A bear is dangerous, but so is a wild dog. And a dog that tangles with a bear can get badly hurt. If this is one of your dogs, keep him tied up. Tie him up. KIKUYA GOODS Hi. Here's some squash. We can use them. - I'll have one. - Okay. - Welcome. - Hello. A grilled squid, please. - That will be 300 yen. - Okay. Thank you. Here you go. He's always been alone, hasn't he? Abandoned, I think. But now, he has you to look after him. I've been taking in strays for over 20 years, now that I think about it. They don't live that long, but they all live full lives. I always figured no one was going to look after me. That was okay. I was resigned to it. But you know, Setsuko... What? There's someone I want to look after! She wants to get married to me! I'm sure you'll be fine together, Tatsuya. Won't they? Sayo! Hi, Setsuko. Were you at practice? Everyone has troubles, but then you realize people are concerned about you. Wasao did, and so should you. Hang on a bit more. You've still got a lot to see. He's like a lion! The white bear? That's Wasao. I'd love to see him! You will. I see him in town. And he comes to the Kikuyas' place sometimes. His face made me happy. He's funny-looking, though. I'm starving. Yes! Me too. - Tomi! - Yes? Let's take a break. Shall we get a bit to eat, then? - Yes! - Okay, then. Her strength has come back, and her condition is stable. We can send her to Hirosaki for the operation now. If you would, please. NAKAMURA RIVER Wasao! You're Akira's dog? Wasao... Mom. I'll be on my way. Thank you. Good night. Thanks. Nagisa? Nagisa. Thank you. Thank you. Nagisa's gone? Wasao? Wasao was here for her. AJIGASAWA'S SPECIALTY THE PROUD TASTE OF THE JAPAN SEA WELCOME TO THE VILLAGE OF SHIRAKAMI What's wrong? Well... Nothing. No?

Now the fireworks are laughing at us. You're right! Akira? Akira? Akira? Akira? Mom... Tatsuya, that was great. Hello! - Beer. - Okay. Tatsuya looked really great today! He did? No, I didn't! What are you smiling about? Monchan had her pups. - She did? - She did? - Isn't that nice? - Isn't that nice? - A toast! - A toast! - You too, Kazue. - Okay. - Cheers! - Cheers! KOEIMARU Gone again!

It's Akira... IN SURGERY Mom... there's trouble! A bear! - Not again! - No. - You're kidding, right? - No! On Narusawa Mountain. Akira is there! - What? - Akira? I saw Akira walk by, and then Wasao went by, and then Wasao met the bear. I swear! It's the truth! - And then? - And then... I don't know. You don't know? - Call Setsuko! - Let's go! - Get everyone! - Yes! Kazue! Call everyone! Excuse me! What's the problem? Can someone come with me? Akira went after Mom. He thinks she won't be back, just like Shiro. What do we do? It's okay. It'll be fine. Hurry up! Hiroshi! Where's Akira? Up in the mountains. We're going to look for him. There's a bear. I'll come too. Setsuko! You wait here. Setsuko, wait! Take me with you. Sure. Hey! - Akira! - Akira! - Akira! - Akira! - Hey! - Akira! - Akira! - Where are you, Akira?
