I'm Jeff Corwin have you ever wondered what it would be like to meet a monster to come face-to-face with the biggest fattest creatures that ever roamed the earth ruled the Seas or took to the skies well that's exactly what I'm about to do I'm going to get up close and personal with some of the most awesome prehistoric animals ever and not only that I'm gonna find their living descendants that are still around today so get ready get ready to meet giant monsters [Music] you ready for an adventure we'll hold on to your hats buckle in your seatbelts because I'm gonna take you in a bumpy rollercoaster ride to evolution we're setting out to find some of the planet's all-time greatest Giants nature's come up with so many amazing weird wonderful exciting ways of surviving and one of them is shoe size and that's what the show is all about giant monsters to find out why they got so big and how they lived I'll be tracking down animals that are still alive today that just might reveal what made these monsters tip there is some much smaller but very special modern-day creatures that can give us a little bit of insight into the lives of those amazing Giants I've come to Arizona to find a lizard here's our first mission is to find a creature that has someone of a simple ordinary design but moves around in a very extraordinary fashion that's what I'm looking for right there it's moving slowly [Music] well this is one of my favorites right here you're a sprite little fellow look at this this is a collared lizard called a collared lizard because it's got that beautiful black collar this creature will take down anything smaller than it it's eating insects other invertebrates but it will also eat small vertebrates small creatures with backbones like lizards and other reptiles it was really spectacular about this animal is the way it gets around when it has a need for speed it does it on two legs and I'm gonna show you right now watch the way this creature moves it's amazing okay ready on your mark get set go did you see that did you see the way this animal was moving it wasn't crawling on all fours this creature went up right it became bipedal and literally was putting all its weight in his back legs his arms were flopping at its side and this creature was moving on his back legs extremely fast in fact the way this creature was moving on twos and not force remind me something it's yours huh no problem just put it back sorry there little guy no altruism here [Music] [Music] [Music] how's that for a monster T-Rex T-Rex what a giant this animal is we're talking about a creature which is 40 feet in length that's an animal that's weighing 12 12 thousand pounds Tyrannosaurus Rex one of the planet's all-time giant meat eaters the collared lizard may look like a junior sized T-Rex but it only runs on two legs when it's running away from danger although both the collared lizard and this animal can be bipedal walking on two limbs the collared lizard does it for short little windows short little spats this creature moves its entire life on those two gigantic hind legs incapable of carrying its huge bulk at speeds of around 30 miles an hour T-Rex evolved in its two legged stance so it could power over the earth and spot prey from a distance which it then ran down with terrific speed they are round at the tail end of the dinosaur experience we're talking just 65 million years ago there were T-Rex is standing right where you are right now [Music] [Music] coast is clear I think man that'll get your heart pumping those vultures smell death thankfully it wasn't me [Music] you know birds are direct descendants of the dinosaurs so they can tell us a lot about Tyrannosaurus Rex vultures have an incredible sense of smell and they might help us pick up the trail of T-Rex's true nature these are some pretty skittish birds eaters of the dead so how is it that these animals can make their way to the putrid buffet that they feed upon look at this yeah here is a vulture skull yah did you notice on those animals the large nostrils the holes what we call nares the reason why they're so large is because these animals have to filter lots of air through them to pick up the tiny stinking little particles that lead them to the deathly stuff they like to eat the chemistry happens back here okay this is the olfactory center we've got those olfactory lobes that gives these animals the ability to pick up minut chemical trails which they then follow from the sky to the earth to dinner and as it so happens the creature tracking me has giant sized olfactory lobes T-Rex would have been able to pick up the faintest whiff of decay from a mile away maybe T-Rex is a huge bulk and physique weren't designed for running down potential prey was such a fantastic sense of smell maybe Tyrannosaurus Rex was more of a scavenger instead [Music] what position to scavengers occupy in nature well it's kind of at the bottom of the dung heap literally the the sanitary workers of our world they're cleaning up all this stuff left behind by predators that can potentially turn into disease I think we're okay less interested in us more interested in that dead cow those teeth I'm thinking like 12 inches extremely sharp excellent for shearing away flesh excellent for bone crunching he's drinking in that stinking smell just like the vultures washing over his whole factory bulbs with that invisible layer the necrotic sweet sin does that guy think I'm after his cow Jeff don't move just don't move don't panic I am out of here well there's no doubt about it just like those vultures T-Rex was definitely a scavenger yeah those great olfactory bulbs for smelling any stink of death about its habitat amazing and of course it was bipedal walking around on two legs just like our little friend darn scavengers you just can't escape me you okay little buddy there sheesh well the age of dinosaurs was a time when reptiles grew massive but while dinosaurs were traveling down their own evolutionary road for a hundred and sixty million years there was another group of reptiles that took a very different route they're still out there and they are the biggest reptiles alive today but you won't believe a big day where at last a little R&R with a couple of rounds of golf and good old sunny Florida a great place to unwind and also a great place to find a group of reptiles that are often referred to as living fossils they've proven to be masters at adapting to environmental changes while they themselves have changed very little over time and they seem to have taken a liking to golf courses that group includes the crocodiles and alligators [Music] Tony did it go in here somewhere you wait my ball didn't you there Mr. Gator huh give me back my ball the American alligator is the largest reptile living in North America and it can grow to more than 12 feet in length not even 20 years ago these creatures almost disappeared fell prey to overhunting and loss of habitat now slow down there buddy hey come here today though they've made a very successful comeback because of conservation laws we have one alligator two every 15 people so we're talking about millions of alligators living in Florida and other parts of the southeast of the United States so what is it about golf courses that Gators like even though this is a man-made habitat it has many of the things that are ideal for the needs of an alligator we've got a water system here in the form of rivers and lakes they can live here protected because these areas to secure and it also has an excellent source of prey not necessarily golfers but it has fish and waterfowl this creature is six feet but it could double in size but imagine this millions of years ago there was a crocodilian that reached 40 feet in size and it was called Sarcosuchus and that my friends was a true monster tipping the scales at ten tons it was the largest croc that ever lived this could happen twice in a week concentration that's the secret my friend to a good game of golf concentration and be the ball sorry my fault that is no ordinary alligator crocodile in fact that's the granddaddy of all crocodilians we're looking at Sarcosuchus imperator it is a giant we're talking like two Mack Trucks lined up from engine defender Tony Tony get in come on buddy come on hold on come on you stupid car something weird is down you know Tony you've been such a good friend that's why this really kills me oh my good no I cannot replace this let's go come on come on you know you wouldn't think these crocodiles be fasting weighs thousands of pounds but they are fast and short spurts but you know what you know what they're faster short spurts not zigzagging [Music] so just how did Sarcosuchus become such a giant monster well as with all reptiles this animal grows throughout its entire life you see with the crocodilians of today american alligators crocodiles right they grow really fast at first and then they start to slow down after they reach sexual maturity this animal it kept growing and growing at least a foot here so by the time it reached 40 feet it was a monster but I think we outrank the monster oh mother I've wasted my life [Music] you feel out of control no huh looks like the tables are turned because there's a bigger predator in control right now and if I wanted to I could oh of course I wouldn't do anything I love these guys these are American crocodiles and American crocodiles as the alligator was not so many years ago are endangered now we're here not only to understand the natural history of the American crocodile but also to understand their growth rate because maybe by exploring the growth rate of American crocodiles we just might find out how Sarcosuchus grew to be so big 46.5 good this is actually a friend of mine Joe Wasilewski and Joe has been conducting a long-term study on these little guys in fact I worked with Joe like six years ago been a while yeah so what exactly you looking at Joe well right now these are animals we caught last night and we need to get some white measurements total length is 26.1 now comes the important measurement the length of the head and that is 1.7 inches it's a real luxury to have the whole crocodile body to study you see with Sarcosuchus we don't have a whole fossil specimen just the skull which was 6 feet in length that's a huge huge head but by working with these animals and looking at the head compared to body ratio we just might get a better understanding of just how big Sarcosuchus was with a six-foot head you're talking about it 40 foot animal to monitor and identify these baby hatchlings once they're back in the wild Jones starts a tiny microchip under the skin and there it is price check plays on a crocodile a mile to please as you see it says right there avid zero four seven one two oh five nine nine this creatures new identity time to let him go all right freedom for the little crocodile let's go [Music] South Florida is the only place in the world where crocodiles and alligators live side-by-side unlike alligators American crocodiles remain endangered you see they have more specialised habitat needs a loss of land of real estate as well as poaching has left a population of only 800 in North America but they have found a refuge here at Turkey Point a protected area next to the Everglades this is why Turkey Point is such an ideal place for these animals because you've got saltwater habitat over there let's see this a freshwater pond are you thinking come on jet these are so water animals they are as juveniles and adults but not as hatchlings even though they have salt excretion glands in their mouths they're not really developed yet so they hang out in these freshwater ponds right so this is kind of like a nursery pool now what happened was mom deposited her eggs and a whole tunneled into the bank along these berms then they hatched okay but what was interesting is that she hung around that nest she wasn't as protective as an alligator but she hung around she was there then she heard a calling from within the nest she excavated pulled the babies out nibbled on the eggshells and then freed them and carried them to this pond where they will stay grow and eventually make their way to the saltwater environment [Music] well that feels good it's so hard to say goodbye unfortunately not all of them gonna make it but maybe one will survive look at this right here holy cow this this great squash in the earth this is a drag it's created by a crocodile normally there this why this one is five feet wide look at the impression made by the tail this is one mother of a crocodile that came sliding up this bank Joe start your engine dude there's something big in there yeah yeah really I'm looking to stick around holy cow that is no ordinary American crocodile that my friends the Sarcosuchus see that opened its mouth and then that thing has got some serious fangs never needs must be big you know you got crocodiles here they're eating fish they're eating crustaceans but an animal like that I bet it's got a bigger appetite hey it's moving man what Joe has spent 12 years collecting data on these Crocs enabling him to monitor their rates of growth and body size over time and make sure that the population is nice and healthy over the time that Joe's been studying these Crocs their numbers have been steadily increasing the information he gathers is used to conserve these animals Joe works the night shift that's when crocodiles are most active they're also easy to spot because their eyes reflect bright red in the beam of the spotlight and this is the best time for us to see a big crocodile come on back up come on go go go go that was close although Sarcosuchus was a huge monster there were probably not many of them around in the primeval rivers of Africa where they lived a hundred and ten million years ago giant monsters need too much food and space to support a large population and Sarcosuchus had very big prayer requirements it was even dinosaurs no one knows why Sarcosuchus died out but just like dinosaurs being giant meant they were vulnerable to change giant spiders were after me guess what guys were on a spider hunt here in Arizona I'm on the trail of one of the closest living relatives of the biggest spider that ever existed a spider that was 2 feet wide and had fangs the size of human fingers that giant monster's name was Megarachne it lived in the rainforests of South America 300 million years ago and might have been one of the first spiders to paralyze prey with venom a spider that big would have packed a wallop of a bite it was huge but then Megarachne modern-day cousin is still a giant in its own right this is what I was looking for there little lady you are little lady come here isn't she beautiful unless of course you've got arachnophobia well I don't have arachnophobia I love these animals this of course is a tarantula a species you find living here in Arizona and they are beautiful absolutely gorgeous creatures all tarantulas belong to a very ancient group of arachnids we call Mygalomorphs and what many Mygalomorphs share in common is they're large in size and of course it's got very large fangs and those fangs work differently than some of the more contemporary spiders for example instead of coming out at the side these vein these things that leaf did up from the top and then slashed into prey they deliver venom that paralyzes their prey but lucky for us is not deadly to humans whether you like them or not they still play a very important role in this ecosystem if you got a tarantula round your house consider yourself lucky because he's probably on the cockroaches that have been hanging under your sink wonderful criatures here go little lady when lovely Mrs. Pat for lunche nice plump giant tarantula this is the Goliath spider or the Giant South American bird-eating spider I have never held a spider as big as this in my hands the Goliath tarantula is the largest spider alive today its leg span is almost a foot across and it can eat birds rodents even poisonous snakes but it would have been food for a creature like giant Megarachne and part of the reason this Goliath wrench look so big she's pregnant she will produce a tennis ball size egg sack of which 51 inch long baby bird eating spiders will emerge each one as deadly an ambush predator as its mom when it hunts it silently waits its prey comes near and it reaches out with those fangs injecting the animal with venom causing paralysis it then grabs on to the prey pulling it in regurgitating this toxic acidic soup of saliva the slop of digestive juices leathers the prey which then begins to melt and decompose and then before you know it's drunk into the belly of this animal go sometimes these animals get a little stage fright with around Jeff Corwin maybe I intimidate that was weird I feel okay though yeah I'm okay except that I can't feel my fingers I can't feel my toes I'm totally paralyzed and what's more I've got a giant spider on my chest it's Megarachne the biggest baddest spider of all time it's pumped me full of its immobilizing venom now it's gonna throw up its digestive juices all over me Oh God I'm melting melting oh what a world I'm been digestive alive what a nightmare whoa that's some potent stuff so how does that spider venom work I've come to the right place to find out here in Arizona is a Living Lab of the world's most venomous spiders all of them living right here in the rec room of one very dedicated scientist welcome to this spider farm you know there are over 30,000 species of spiders out there what many of them share in common is that they're armed with venom now right here we have a whole stack of spiders for example look at this oh she made and then she kills the infamous black widow spider right there big female males are very small and sized and of course after they breed females are famous for eating their mates this spider right here very nondescript you thinking what can that do pretty much dissolve yep it bites yet this is the brown recluse now what happens if this one bite you it produces a necro toxic venom a venom which over time breaks down and degrades flesh you can actually die from the spider this is a Chilean rose hair tarantula what's cool about these spiders is that if you ever have a heart attack this just might be the animal that'll save you for more on that follow me over here hey Chuck alright hey dude good to see you well this is Chuck Kristensen and he's a biochemist that specializes in venom extraction of arachnids so how many spiders do you have here 70,000 spiders in your house living here and and other areas so and you you and your wife and your family live here yeah that's totally cool so you live with your spiders how do you get the venom out who you were gonna try that up okay you want me to try it sure why not okay okay Chuck's with both fangs over the lip of this little plastic vial fang then how do you get the venom out of the glands and into the into the bile okay we use a very mild electrical stimulation with these tweezers okay so you want to soak these with saline okay little salty water right and put them across the base of the chelicerae okay which is the base of the where the fang needs the head right right it's electricity enough to stimulate the gland to release the venom but not enough to really hurt the animal these spiders are helping in cutting-edge medical research inside this tiny drop of tarantula venom is a protein that could prevent deaths from heart attacks during a heart attack there are special channels in your heart cells which open and release chemicals disrupting the heart's rhythm and that's what can kill you but the protein in the spider's venom blocks those channels so the heart can beat normally and maybe someday what came out of this spider may be used to save your life or mine the giant super sized spider Megarachne would have packed enough venom to kill the huge insects that lived here 300 million years ago they would have had enough venom to knock down vertebrate prey creatures with backbones animals like you and me how did they get so big you see way back then those primordial forests were made up of newly evolved oxygen producing plants they were so efficient at creating this gas of life that the atmosphere back then had almost twice the level of oxygen compared today and that's one of the ways that Megarachne could get so big in size because these animals breathe through very primitive respiratory system called booked lungs basically for slashes in either side which passively allow oxygen to flow into their bodies we're different we have an active respiratory system our lungs are inflated by a muscle underneath which pulls down crates of vacuum stretching the lung tissue pulling the oxygen in okay but if you're a spider there's a limit to the size you can be because there's a limit to how fast and how quickly the air can travel to vitalize your body tissue so if you have doubled the oxygen level you end up with gigantic spiders oh I've got that sensation that we are not alone you know back during the Carboniferous period Megarachne wasn't the only giant invertebrate inhabiting that landscape for example you had millipedes as long as my leg you had a dragonflies with wingspans as big as hawks they were they're huge [Music] [Music] after the extinction of the dinosaurs giant spiders and killer crocs the world must have felt somewhat empty of large monster animals smaller creatures now inhabited the earth but it wasn't long before some of them started getting big really big and this time humans were around to experience them and the most lethal of these was a cat that literally gutted its prey with fangs the size of butchers knives it was ultimate mammalian assassin did you ever have the feeling you're being followed we need to stay alert because we're moving through habitat which is home to one of Florida's most stealthy predators out here in this dense vegetation this creature is using the twisted limbs and veins and these old palms has a bluff as a natural blind to be near invisible from the creatures it's tracking it is an ambush predator it's coming very quietly look right between these two hole trees right there this is a Texan cougar now it's not a native to Florida it's a new immigrant you see it's a close relative of a creature that lives here that happens to be one of the rarest mammals on our planet this Texan cougar that's been brought in to try to stabilize the population of Florida panther and to give us more information about that I've got a colleague of mine Steve Torbett he's with the National Wildlife Federation so what is the reason for taking animal that's not native to here but introducing it to the wild population many years ago biologists working with Panthers became concerned about some malformations that they began to see in the in the Panthers and a small population inbreeding father's breeding with daughters brothers and sisters breeding and so they were very concerned that the gene pool was becoming very small so the idea was you bring in these Texas Cougars are very closely related subspecies you introduce that diversity into the gene pool and through that diversity you help broaden their ability to deal with any environmental challenges but most importantly most immediately you improve the reproductive capacity ten thousand years ago there was another feline making its way across the Florida landscape and I actually brought a cast of its skull and I think Steve said it best it's kind of like a Florida panther on steroids this skull is from a saber-toothed cat a Smilodon or knife tooth and guess what some of them had 10-inch teeth these teeth are very specialized you can see a couple of things not just the sheer size of of the teeth but the fact that they're shaped like a knife they're not rounded like the Florida panther and they're indicative of a highly specialized predator this is an animal who evolved with many large animals ten thousand years ago and needed this size this bulk these kinds of teeth and as the world began to change in the prey became smaller and perhaps those teeth were not as useful we began to see this top predator replaced with other smaller top predators like the Florida panther but now it's the world around the Florida panther that you rapidly-changing you see we're digging up its habitat we're putting in interstate highways draining the swamps and radically altering the environment the real question is whether there'll be enough room in the future for animals like the Florida panther in the last 30 years 44 individual Florida Panthers have been hit and killed by oncoming traffic if you add that up that is more than half of the living population of today's Florida panther which is that 80 but lucky for the Florida panther the people that are managing and trying to conserve these animals have come up with a very interesting solution we've got this chain-link fence which funnels them under this bridge it functions as almost like a funnel or a causeway and since they've installed these fences the mortalities on some areas have gone down from eight to zero okay come under this bridge this is a trigger this black box is a trigger and has a beam it comes out because come over here that beam is connected to this signal system which then takes a picture the cat comes across and then takes a picture you won't believe this we've got a Florida panther actually laying against one of these calls you know these biologists spend their entire career studying these animals and sometimes never get to see one in the ground of course with me look at this it is getting up that's not a Florida panther it is a Smilodon those teeth were meant for gouging into the belly of prey spilling out innards this was an animal that was not built for speed and it's coming this way it's probably just gonna pass here you go he went his way I'm gonna go my way and go change my shorts just ten thousand years ago Smilodon was still roaming the Florida landscape the Native Americans who first settled here came face to face with this giant cat and that might be one of the reasons why these animals disappeared today what was Smilodon domain as now the Florida panther National Wildlife Refuge Larry Richardson is the senior biologist but the US Fish and Wildlife Service he spent 12 years tracking and monitoring the panther population here 30 panthers currently have radio collars and each one has its own frequency we think there's a large male in this area but they're exceptionally secretive and we gonna see it unlikely I just stopped for one second stop stop stop what's the range of this thing up to a mile we get about a mile range right there beyond those trees is a Florida panther we swing around yep move in that direction yep okay we're backing up because we saw those black vultures up theirs see that right there on that pine tree do you smell something dead wouldn't that be cool it was actually a killer something smells big I serve as a panther kill now where's that smell coming from hungry hungry Smilodon [Music] well that was close lucky for me that this animal is not really built for speed this animal is designed for ambushing taking its prey by surprise and human beings could have been among the victims a bipedal animal a homo sapien just like ourselves possible prey for this massive cat you know what I think this guy was injured see that it's got a limp it's getting a bit huh where are you going you know injuries were nothing new for these animals in fact from the fossil record we know that they would break their bones but what's amazing is that they would survive to hunt another day why is that possible well one theory is that they were communal or social animals hunting in a pack or group like lions they would move out there on the landscape hunting as a team but if you got injured you could hit the benches let your teammates do the work and when you when you're feeling better you just jump back into the game of hunting not very good table manners so why did saber-tooth cat have such big teeth and why was it so big in size well you see back then it was kind of like being caught up in an evolutionary arms race it was about being the fittest which was often defined by being the biggest now by having big prey you had to be large in size to capture it and eat it back then this wasn't the only giant roaming this landscape you got to check out this next creature there's a gentle plant eater that lives and hides high in these trees amazingly it is the closest living relative to one of the most spectacular prehistoric giants that monster was a leaf eater too but and may have had a taste for blood to find out the true nature of the beast I'm seeking its gentle modern-day cousin the mysterious creature we've come to find spends its entire life upside down it eats upside down sleeps upside down females give birth upside down so I guess they're right-side up and I'm upside down find this creature all you have to do is follow me keep in mind we have a luxury when I'm working with wildlife and that is I can take my time because these animals ain't too fast these bizarre but sweet looking creatures are sloths what all sloths share in common is that they are exhaustingly slow and you find them living in the jungles of Central and South America and they're just so cool and just so slow the sloth moves about with these caliper like hook like claws so this animal is sort of hooking its way through its habitat climbing from limb to limb give me a hug yes I love you too all right now he's giving me a hug and look at my back it's not the first time I've had scratches oop different show now you've got two types of slots you've got two toed and three toes these two-toed sloths claws are two inches long but those of their giant cousins reached up a foot and length what is a sloth eating it's eating plants and more specifically it's a folivore its eating leaves for the most part leaves are poor quality food but because sloths are so slow and use very little energy this diet can sustain them in fact they live their entire lives and get all their food from just a very few favorite trees 99% of this animals life is spent up in the treetops but they will occasionally go to the forest floor to relieve themselves to go to the loo as the English say now that's a pretty dangerous operation to undertake because by moving heading down to the forest floor they expose themselves to predators they're burning energy but lucky for the sloth its metabolism is so slow it's only doing it maybe once every week or so but why one reason may be that they're instinctively fertilizing the very trees they feed on the other reason goes something like this and has something to do with the ancestry of these animals although the sloths of today are living up there their ancestors weren't they were on the ground and just how big were these guys to answer that you gotta check this out well here's one big pile of crap huh if you had this coming out your backside you need a bidet the size of a swimming pool to get a little relief this is an example of just how big this creature was producing at one sitting a good 40 to 50 pounds of scat it was the distant relative of the arboreal sloth and its name was Megatherium and from the looks of it it was no need of fiber getting plenty of it in his diet and maybe some apple skins and peanut shells as well and there it is it's colossal I mean I'm thinking 13 feet tall maybe 20 feet long it's hard to believe that this creature is a relation to the animal we discovered clawing its way through the canopy Megatherium was the largest of many species of ground sloths that lived right across the Americas try to imagine what it was like to see herds of these giants lumbering their way across the plains of North America we're talking 11,000 years ago while ancient northamericans were hunting they were going face to face with these giants unbelievable so why is Megatherium so dramatically large in size well one theory suggests that it has to do with eating because by being big you cut down competition with the other herbivores plus you have better access to the crowns of the trees that you're browsing on the other reason has to do with predation by being so big you essentially outweigh your predators but defenseless this animal was not in fact it did have a secret weapon its claws I certainly wasn't planning on a haircut never mind a scalping how about the claws of that creature here's a nice close-up check this out here is a fossilized example of a ground sloths claw you can see it actually has a blade to it a nice sharp edge so not only could it sir slash in defense but it also might have been used as a tool to maybe slice open the belly of a decomposing creature because not only was this animal partaking a plant matter possibly animal matter as well does this savage claw reveal a darker side was he a giant flesh-eating monster unlike its gentle tree-living cousins of today as you can see these animals are masters at climbing he is perfectly designed staying upside down and move elegantly through its habitat it pays a price though for being built for climbing it's not a very good walker it's going to look a little pathetic but what you will see is that this animal has to crawl his way to his habitat it's going as fast as it can and it's just not fast enough and in this position this creature is so vulnerable a harpy eagle she could just come out of knowing his right good bye sloth right so this animal not good for walking it's meant for climbing the ground sloth that big old giant from our past different story we know that this creature was moving around on all fours and we also have new fossil evidence a set of tracks which suggests that this creature could move bipedally on two legs for short distances almost grizzly bear fashion with with the sharp claws of the feet curled inward sort of moving and a gait like that I did not expect to see this a Smilodon kill see those those Smilodon sits almost like a lion prey but look what's looming above it's a giant sloth what what is going on you know what this animal is definitely interested in this carcass so I guess it's not only an herbivore but it's also a scavenger as well Smilodon do not like this guy hanging around there kill look at this he doesn't even care he's just hunkered over he's eating there's a cat coming around Smilodon he just got that cat down that cats are gone it so not only is that that talon a tool for leaves and a tool for flesh but it's also a weapon as well and from the looks of that Smilodon a pretty good one [Music] from the ashes of the dinosaurs came the last brood of the giant reptiles they had arisen once again this time to face man now I'd like to take you on a journey 30,000 years ago to Australia and I want to tell you a story of giants and monsters there were giant ten foot tall kangaroos hopping their way across the Australian outback there were even marsupial lions feasting upon giant wombat and koala meat and there was the greatest lizard that ever walked the earth how exactly did this lizard get to be so big to answer this we need to look at its closest living relative it is a monster in its own right a fearsome living dragon that is today tragically struggling against over hunting and the loss of its habitat this is the Miami Metro zoo and we're here because this place is home to Komodo dragons now you're not in Miami at the zoo and you want to see these creatures you have to go to the islands of Komodo about four islands off Indonesia this is the place where these giant lizards live in the wild and they are the largest living lizard on our planet they're huge look at this guy from my foot to my head we're talking about a 6-foot lizard and this guy's just a teenager when they become adults they can reach nearly ten feet in length weigh hundreds of pounds they are a massive giant monitor if you think this animals big you need to check out its cousin named Megalania which was living on the island of Australia as early as 50 thousand years ago it was up to 20 feet long weighing over half a ton and that animal was eating Rhino sized marsupials speaking of eating this guy's got a sister that's ready to take some food so let let our lovely reptile friend lead the way come on come on let's go come get it come get it it's feeding time at the Metro zoo when I talk about feeding I'm not talking about the petting zoo because this animal has quite a bite this creatures mouth is a host to more than 50 different species of bacteria you see if you to look closely at the teeth you would see that they're almost serrated and that serrations of the teeth has some important functions first of all it allows this creature to shred and rip into the prey pull it apart right but second of all it creates all these little cavities for the bacteria to hang out for example you get a nice wad of flesh in there maybe a bit of a wild pig stuck up in there between two conical teeth right starts to rot and fester and this animal uses that bacteria as a rattlesnake would use venom you see out the wild the Komodo dragon it's an ambush predator with a deadly bite if the massive jaws don't do you in right away then it's toxic spit will polish you off soon enough the wound begins to spread and putrified causing a slow lingering them all the Komodo has to do as follow is flickering forked tongue defined yet it can smell rotting meat at three miles away he's picking up those microscopic particles so it doesn't have to be fast there's nowhere to go in that island he just bites the prey the prey wanders off eventually dies and he chases way to it this animal is literally top dog or better said top lizard on that remote island it has no competition it is the ultimate pinnacle predator at the top also keep in mind that living there in Komodo Island are some other large creatures many of which are a part of this animals diet it's eating everything from wild pig to deer to buffalo and at one time many thousands of years ago fossil evidence suggests that it was eating pygmy elephants the Komodos ancient relative Megalania could have gone to its monstrous size because it had even bigger prey to pick on it was feeding on two-ton prehistoric wombats this is the big guy right here this is Jack and this is the father of the Komodo dragons we've seen earlier Jack began his life on Komodo Island but he was brought over for an important reason to help breed these animals the mate of this creature by the way they're separated because he tends to one a lot of lovin and won't leave her alone so they're separated so he's not messing with her too much but when he does mess he messes up good she's produced 30 eggs of which 27 have hatched so this is a very successful program when it comes to breeding Komodo dragons you're one bigladies man aren't you see that you're getting a nice example of that toxic dripping drool weeping from the lips of this creature let me show you what it's like inside a komodo dragons mouth safely look at this this is a skull of a komodo dragon extraordinary now those teeth really come to life and there's a lot of neat things about this job for example you'll see almost like a shark there are rows of teeth in there which break off and replaced frequently when they get lodged in muscle tissue and torn away or broken off as this creature consumes prey I've seen Komodo dragons communally battle over access to a goat and one Komodo grabs the goat at one end while the other takes the hind end and they literally hide in court of this thing and it's gone in minutes but imagine if this was the jaw not of varanus Komodo ancest right the Komodo dragon but of Megalania all right the jaw wouldn't be 11 inches in length it would be colossal and the teeth would not be a quarter of an inch in length they would be an inch long powerful teeth a month [Music] unlike dinosaurs which disappeared long before we made an appearance here on planet Earth this guy was around when human beings were as well and not only was to sharing habitat with human beings that might have been eating them as well then around forty six thousand years ago it disappeared they vanished maybe human beings started competing with this creature for access to this same prey [Music] hey buddy around here we like to recycle there they go there we go the lumbars I'll leave a mark where the zookeepers when you need them huh yeah you keep walking there big guy cuz I'm getting up and now you're in real trouble no I'm joking you just keep walking so whatever happened to Megalania well it became extinct tragically not so long ago but the lesson we need to learn from this is that if we're gonna keep the modern-day cousin of Megalania the Komodo dragon on our planet requires some good conservation because there's only 5,000 left the giant reptiles ruled the earth for millions of years but guess what they also ruled the sky on land you can see how being big kind of gives you that competitive edge but up in the skies that's a different story and that's where I'm headed off I go into the wild blue yonder with a professional pilot who's teaching me how to hang line [Music] this is just a wonderful feeling I spent so much of my life up in an airplane but this is very different because there are no sounds of motors or engines the basic principle of this hang glider was adopted 220 million years ago by the first vertebrate ever to evolve flight the Pterosaurs and one of them pushed this design to the limits something's coming around us might be another hang glider holy crap that is not a hang glider look at that look at that that thing right there my gosh that is no hang glider it is a Pterosaur one of the greatest of all flyers that ever lived upon this planet Quetzalcoatlus I mean look at that I think is amazing huge huge creature that thing has to have a wingspan at about 37 feet you know what he is really close dude he is really far we got to get out of his way what is he doing still right on our tail you know what I'll be like get out of the sky where'd he go where'd he go that is surreal to have a pterosaur hanging on your behind man you good at maneuvering that thing was so close I gotta tell you I feel a lot safer on the earth than up in the skies with Quetzalcoatlus is flying around you know these Pterosaurs were around for a hundred and forty million years and while the dinosaurs were ruling terra formerly Pterosaurs were ruling the heavens and this guy right here Quetzalcoatlus was the largest in fact the largest of all flying creatures that ever ruled our earth they were masters at soaring the question is how did they get up in the air and to learn how these giant monsters flew you got to check out the Smoky Mountains [Music] in these forests lives one of America's most spectacular fliers the bald eagle and it provides us with a different look at how a large creature can take to the air today it's birds that ruled the skies and the bald eagle is among the biggest despite its size and stature as the u.s. national emblem in the past bald eagle population suffered serious setbacks okay so we're not up here for the view in fact this is the hacking or release tower for the American Eagle Foundation and we're about to see a bird which was born in captivity get a second lease on life I'm here with Al Cecere founder and president of the American Eagle foundation he's putting on the finishing touches for this Eagles new life in the wild now Quetzalcoatlus it disappeared because of natural extinction and that does happen most of the things that have been upon our planet have disappeared but what happened to the bald eagle as with Quetzalcoatlus this creature is a piscivore a fish eater right but here's how its diet affected itself we were using pesticides like DDT the DDT went into the fish okay these animals ate the fish and it didn't necessarily affect them physically the great impact was on the offsprings because when they would lay an egg the chemical inside the DDT would actually destroy the eggshell creating a very brittle egg but because of good conservation laws dedicated naturalist and conservationists this animal has made an extraordinary comeback it is an american conservation success story what we're gonna do is attach a radio transmitter to this animal what this instrument does is it allows us to track this creatures called radio telemetry we can know where it's moving and I will put the winged marker on the tag so this is this is 1 D 1 D so now we've got all these tags attached transmitters are are on top of this animal and tomorrow this creature will taste freedom for the very first time in its life [Music] this eagle is just 14 weeks old but when fully grown its wingspan will reach over six feet and it will fly at more than 40 miles per hour fossils found in Texas shows Quetzalcoatlus had a wingspan six times that of a bald eagle its wings were almost 40 feet across literally as big as an aircraft and when it stood it was almost 30 feet tall but it only weighed around a hundred pounds surprisingly light for a creature this size and that was a secret to its success but was it's outrageous size the reason for its downfall it's thought that around 65 million years ago climate changes resulted in very strong winds making it very hard or something this big to soar Quetzalcoatlus went where the wind took it but it had a hard time going anywhere else because it sacrificed power for size now I know why scientists look at this piece and consider it to be well kind of like the 747 of the ancient animal world but did you notice the way it was moving the way it was gliding like that not a lot of effort with regard to flapping that's because it's not a very good flapper unlike a bald eagle which has very powerful muscles which will roll forward primary feathers into the wind creating lift this animal can't do that instead it functions by just shear surface area spreading out over the wind allowing the hot air to pick up it's hot out today this heat and the shape of this landscape creates an ideal habitat to this creature when it gets up in the air a little more winds especially hot stuff we call thermals it does very well like birds this creature had hollow bones unlike birds the wing structure and design completely different okay for example as we know from looking at that bald eagle covered by feathers this creature does not use feathers instead more like a bat it has a membrane of skin it's called Patagium which makes its way from the finger region down to the lower part of the body so it spreads out spreads those wings it has tremendous surface area look at that it's gliding just like that hang glider we were on look at that there you go further evidence that this creature is piscivorous it is a fish eater it spotted that prey beneath the water and then snatched it up but very different than the bald eagle who was not using talons instead it was using that massive seven foot long bill I look this it's coming about again [Music] yep definitely a fish eater it's a very hot tendency morning it's also the day that this eagle gets freedom [Music] okay so here's the scoop I'm gonna pull this levy it controls a door which will flap up and then this animal has the opportunity to fly away it could be very quick it can take a bit of time but what we want is a spread of life [Music] [Music] see that perfect and hopefully this creature will come back here with the mate and helped us local breeding population of bald eagles great stuff [Music] coming up on Animal Planet we're taking off to meet our last giant but we're going to have to dive deep to find it we take to the Seas to be our last giant monster and this one is still alive throughout time evolution has thrown up some spectacular giant spiders the size of dogs bats with 10 inch long canines flying reptiles the size of small planes being a giant monster gave them an edge when competing with other animals but being so huge also had its downside when conditions changed these giants were just too big and too specialized to adapt so they fell prey to extinction but guess what one of these giant monsters still exist it's a secretive of Leviathan in the deepest parts of the ocean and we've come to the squid capital of the world Monterey to find out more I am starving huh what a journey this was okay I know what I want how's the calamari excellent fresh fresh excellent thank you sir I can I get a diet soda thank you what a journey this has been I have worked up a tremendous appetite I mean we have been up and down we've encountered big and small and great stuff but oh quick excellent service and I can't think of a better way to satisfy my appetite than a plate of calamari it's hard to believe that sailors were terrified of calamari not exactly this animal right here but it's cousin the Kraken a gigantic behemoth of a beast that just by swirling its arms in the water could create a whirlpool so who are exactly what is this creature the real beast is more terrifying than the fictional one it is Architeuthis this gigantic huge double bus-sized creature living at the bottom of the ocean I've come to Monterrey to better understand this mysterious monster of the deep sea I want to be the first person who comes face-to-face with the giant squid and a true wild situation needs more lemon garçon s'il vous plait citron hello the giant squid has never been seen alive in its natural habitat but perhaps one day this may be possible scientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute are using a high-tech submersible to study the marine life living in deeper waters it can dive thousands of feet into the depths where the monster is thought to live it's named Ventana and it is an ROV which means a remote operated vessel the ROV records images and take samples under cold temperature crushing pressures and complete darkness it has recorded weird and wonderful types of marine life including previously unknown species of squid although the giant squid has yet to be seen evidence of the giant squid comes from dead ones that have been found in the bellies of sperm whales and from those that have washed onto the beaches across the world unfortunately global warming could be the cause of why recently many have been found dead in beaches but corpses of the giant squid can only reveal so much by looking at live squid we can get an idea about the behavior of this mysterious giant and solved the mystery of why theyget so big this is your typical calamari fried tartar sauce eat in californian market squid whoo see that the ink spraying the ink like that that's a defensive mechanism just seeing right there squid see what he just did he nailed me he got me he pelted me with this black soupy substance basically it allows this animal to do the old one two three I'm gone it allows this animal do a disappearing act under water because when predators are moving in they'll spray this black cloud of ink underwater and then use their jet propulsion zip right out of you zip right out of harm's way these animals have a tremendous growth rate the lifespan of these creatures is like six months half a year these babies hatched out from egg sacs you get a couple of hundred to an individual egg sac and look how tiny they are they're nearly microscopic so in six months these animals go from nearly microscopic plankton like creatures to what you see right here nine inch long eating machines these animals happy eat and eat and eat because every day they add on an additional 10% embody ways they are voracious intelligent predators with highly complex brains and moves so fast you can only see them attack their prey in slow motion to long tentacle shootout grab the prey eight shorter arms with rows of suckers hold the prey tight and bring it to the squids formidable mouth with the pressing beak just try to imagine how voracious the giant squid must be it has to reach its full monster size and just four years surely one of the fastest growing animals in the world so how does an animal go from this big to forty to sixty feet in length in four years by eating a tremendous amount of food and that is the next part of our journey we're leaving the safety of this lab with the mysteries of the deep [Music] I'm on a hunt for a deep sea monster the world's largest invertebrate a highly intelligent carnivorous creature with the largest eyes in the planet eyes the size of a human head swiveling back and forth looking but the faintest flash of light that might reveal its prey [Music] the giant squid can hover motionless in mid-water waiting in the dark surrounding it is a zone of extreme danger [Music] [Music] look look look [Music] I stared death in the face I the I I went with the Leviathan but in the end I was the victor these animals have been hanging around on this planet for millions and millions of years and just who knows how big they get think you'll get even bigger or there could be millions of them out there because we're just now understanding their natural history learning how they survived and in the mysterious depths of our world's oceans it couldn't be other giants out there as well in the end we may never know because we're the stewards of these waters and if we don't protect these oceans we could lose the giant squid [Screams] well you can't beat this for wrapping up our exploration of of giant monsters we've learned that extinction has its place in nature that in the end a formula for survival will only last so long but with that said we can't forget that there are creatures living in our world today perfectly adapted for survival but face uncertain futures because of our behavior we are the stewards of our planet are these creatures of today to become the giant monsters of our future in the end life will find a way but it's up to us to give it a chance guys I got a thank you I couldn't have done it without you especially you you were good hey none of that hey hey wise guy can't trust this guy huh [Music] Animal Planet is proud to be a partner with the National Wildlife Federation to bring you this program if you'd like to find out how you can help endangered species
