It was generally just a group of blokes mucking about together, I think. not to everyone's taste but then again each to their own as they say. It's not the sort of thing that you'd broadcast to your ordinary friends or acquaintances. You know if you say oh I belong to the golf club or the Cricket Club I can relate with that, but... when you say oh I belong to a sort of SM group which likes things like, you know, beatings, bondage, tits torture, cock and balls torture fisting... It was private It was your private life, that's what private meant. But we never thought we'd do anything illegal. I'll take you through a sort of typical thing [Music] [Music] Yeah, it was...it was a sex party strictly illegal under the... not more than two gay people having sex in a building type rules of the day. But it was essentially private [Music] so straight away we got down to having a cup of tea and natter about nothing in particular. Then, they knew of some outdoor place which is a sort of deserted tower. So we went off to this tower and... then one of the chaps he was wearing a kilt, quite a nice kilt, I don't know what the tartan was, and he peered over the edge of the top of this ruin and then lifted his kilt up and... a couple of us started whacking him with belts and canes and things. One of the phrases was "paying his pleasure" and, if done in the right way, pain can be quite enjoyable. Nobody was like kidnapped, tied up and tortured or even required any medical treatment. It was all actually really rather friendly, pretty laid back. And we... we did film it with the sound and all the rest and later on we edited it together. They were just made for the people within them to watch and, being pre-computer days, of course they didn't flood all over the world to the Internet Though certainly self made, they were pretty good movies after all. Nice back ----always likes back---- At the time the general attitude to gay folk was not good. It was pretty much the height of the AIDS panic that flooded the country The government was very anti. and so the climate for anything gay wasn't great at the time. Anderson, who was chief constable in Manchester area, was very anti-gay. And, unfortunately, it's in Manchester that one of our tapes came to be seen by the police. Then, a couple of weeks later, just gone 7 a.m., there was a loud banging at the door and there were seven policemen there from the obscene publications squad led by Chief Inspector Haynes, I think he was. So they hurtled in the house and questioned me for about two hours while searching through stuff. They brought a toy billiard cue down from the bedroom and they said "do you use this to beat people with?'" I said "no, I use it to turn the television on and off as a remote control". And they said "Have you got any comments ?" I said "Yes. I don't say how can I be guilty of anything when everything was done with consent". And that was it! And then, about... well, it must have been less than a week after being charged, I got called in at work and and the... a couple of levels higher up than me, they said "Have you seen today's papers?" I said no, "Don't get them. Anyway - he said - you know... So you better go homme like now". So that was it. I've worked there for years and I was in a good position. Not a single word of thanks for the effort put over the years or anything. The trial... it...it was all unreal like you're in a dream almost You drag yourself up to the Crown Court everyday and we had the somewhat aptly named judge Rant. By the time we got to the trial, I think there was 15 of us I shouldn't think I'd met more, about three of them, three or four at the most unlike the way it was reported which was that, you know, this was a network of evil blokes. It wasn't really network, it was more a sort of chain someone knew someone, someone knew someone else... I can remember the prosecution made a real big point of how the people on the receiving end of all this, the submissive types were poor hard done boys, you know, abused persons and how the people doing it were... hmmm...nasty bastards who really they caused the trouble. That sort of attitude took no account to the fact that we switch roles so presumably went from innocent to guilty and back on a fairly regular basis. [Music] We were advised to plead guilty [Music] mainly on the grounds that if we pled not guilty and we were found guilty the sentences would be greater. But that was twisted around by the media the tabloids reveled in it, absolutely loved it. Anyway, it's all too much for me [Music] I was actually... under some psychiatrist. I'm not quite sure why I think it was the feeling of persecution by the system [Music] That was really what got to me. It was the feeling that, quotes, society didn't like me. Everyone likes to be liked [Music] We were taken in one of these... police vans with the blackened windows. You see, it's all... sort of fiberglass molded interior half sleeky on the corners. and you could see the sort of pressman's camera flashes through the dark glass. I remember my mates saying "Oh they're jolly good handcuffs! I don't suppose I could have a set for later because they're better than the ones I've got". We all ended up at Wandsworth which is an awful bloody place. The whole atmosphere was... just menace... You felt you could be, you know... done... anytime. I know for one of my friends, he said he he never really felt at ease again which is what they wanted from the beginning. The police had known their hows, that bringing this case would acts as an example to all those perverts, that this sort of thing must be and will be stamped out. Our case actually had the opposite effect. There was loads of marches of protests all over the place, far more publicity than if they'd done nothing and that kept public awareness high. [Music] The upshot of this was that my mate and I got loads and loads of mail. Every day we would get probably 80% of the wings mail. [Music] We get postcards, letters It was very good, to be honest, to have that wall plastered with all these cards and things. [Music] It really did make you feel less alone. In today's world, some what?... 30 odd years later almost, I wouldn't say it's accepted in mainstream but it's sort of understood So it's... things have moved on a little bit but it's a very thin veneer society's approval or disapproval of anything.
