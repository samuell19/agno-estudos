I'm Myles Parks. Thanks for coming out tonight. I'll start by telling you a little about myself. I'm in my mid-30s, and I'm single. So that's cool, I guess. It's like the killer combo right there. When you say that to people, they give you that sad look like, oh, really? Like I'm an immigrant from Haiti who lost his home in an earthquake. Same look. But I'm fine, I'm okay with it, because my career is soaring. Settle up. You in a hurry? Got a place to be. Another gig? We agreed on 50. You had a drink. A whiskey coke is $20? Plus fees. You didn't exactly bring in a crowd. You make me money, I'll make you money. You're a walking cliche, Jack. Nelson Fritch, I'm a talent agent. You look like a man in need of representation. I've already come this far on my own. Sorry I missed the gig. How'd it go? About how you'd expect. Did Jack try to stiff you? Want me to talk to him? $20 isn't gonna help me make rent. Nelson, you drinking? I'll have a lite beer, please. Four dollars. Put it on my tab, asshole. He's gonna take that out of my pay next time. Hey, there won't be a next time. Look, I know the gig tomorrow night is a big deal. - Huge. - High profile, - something or other. - The biggest of your career. But it's still just one gig. Maybe. I'm working on something. I don't really wanna say too much about it right now. It's big. Myles, come prepared tomorrow. It's the Pantages Theater. I have pulled every single possible string to make this happen, and, now, it's all riding on you to deliver. It's exciting, right? Cut it out, Nelson. I'm just trying to keep these expectations in check. See you tomorrow, buddy. Myles, come back soon and do another set, all right? Go fuck yourself, Jack. You're still here, Lawrence? Yeah, I was just finishing up, Miss Gotti. You know to call me Donna. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. We have a show to get ready for. Yeah. Oh, and, Lawrence, don't forget to turn on the ghost light. We wouldn't wanna invite in any unwanted guests. Hello? Miss Gotti? All right, well, it's time to go, I'm locking up. What the fuck is that? Shit! Shit, shit. All right, fuck you! I'm setting the alarm and locking up. The cops will deal with you when they show up. The best music. I'm Jay Barilla, and I'll be bringing you more underground music at the top of the hour. I'll also be announcing the winner of the two free tickets to the Reggie Ray show we've been hawking this week, and, let me tell you, there has been no shortage of callers trying to get at these tickets. Let's hope Reggie Ray can regain some of his former glory. Either way, it'll be a packed house, and two lucky listeners will be there to report back to us later. This. Hey, can I help you out. If you're here for the show, you're gonna have to come back later. Oh, no, I'm Myles, Myles Parks. The opening act, my name's all over the flyer. Myles, sorry about that, nice to meet you. I'm the stage manager Andy. Let me show you around. So we've got a couple of hours before we start letting people in. Relax, get ready. I was hoping I could feel the stage out a little after I've settled in. Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, Bryce, where's Lawrence? It's not my turn to watch him. I haven't seen him, either. Okay. Hey, Bethany, where's Lawrence? I haven't seen him. Let me know if you find him. The ghost light tipped over last night and shattered. What's the ghost light? Oh, it's just an old superstition. Theaters are filthy with them. It's not a superstition if it's true. Performer? Opening act. No pressure, right? I hope you're funny. I think I'm hilarious. So far, you're not doing much for my confidence. Too bad, you're really helping mine. Hey, we should get moving. I've got a lot of things to do before showtime, so. Good luck tonight. This way, try to keep up. Your room should be right here. I'll be around. So if you need anything, just let me know. - Thanks. - Just doing my job. Oh, for fuck's sake. Here at last. Jesus, Nelson, let yourself in. I did. I'm here to save the day. My knight in shining armor. You need anything right now? Besides the gift basket, my privacy. You're gonna have all the privacy you can handle tomorrow. How you feeling? Not getting the jitters on me, are you? When I woke up this morning, I swear I smelled coffee in the house. You don't drink coffee. Mia did. It makes sense. Tonight is a big night, and it's gonna bring up a lot of thoughts and feelings that you've already worked through. Thanks, doc, what am I paying my therapist for? Hey, I've been in the business a long time, okay? I've seen it. I think I just need my pills. I left them somewhere, but I can't remember where. It's not the pills, it's nerves. Maybe, I sure would feel better if I had my pills, though. Where the hell did you find them? At the bar last night. It was weird, I went to the bathroom, I came back, you were gone, and the pills were sitting right there. When were you going to tell me? I was thinking, maybe, you could hold off on taking the pills tonight. Are you being serious right now? Myles, tonight is a big night. You've said it for the 6000th time. I need you to be sharp. I'm not taking bath salts, it's medication. You know what I'm talking about. Thanks for the advice. All I'm asking is that you think about it, okay? It's nerves, that's it, I promise. I'll think about it. I wanna start by telling you something about me. I am a registered sex offender. Maybe not the best place to start. I'm just kidding! I'm not registered. Honestly, I think sex offenders are the worst kinds of people. Well, them and door-to-door Bible salesmen. Actually, I think door-to-door Bible salesmen are way worse. Maybe that's just me. No, at least sex offenders aren't trying to cram something down my throat every Sunday morning at eight am. No, my uncle visits on Saturdays. Starting with the sex offender routine. Not a good idea? Doesn't seem to suit you, not very endearing. But I'm not a comedian. Who are you then? Donna Gotti. I'm the theater director. I'm Myles. - I know. - Right. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. Thanks for hosting the show. I'm excited to be here. Don't thank me. I'd be doing Moliere if I could, but the way people attend theater these days, it was necessary to diversify. Not a fan of comedy? Moliere was a comedic writer, Mr. Parks. You should read him sometime. You might enjoy yourself. I wish you the best tonight. I get it, you're busy or whatever, but I need information, so, if you know anything, just tell me now. I don't know anything. You kids telling secrets? Hey, did you go in the basement? Didn't even know there was a basement. I told you. Check yourself, girlfriend. We haven't asked everyone yet. Something go missing? Somebody broke the lock on the door. First, the ghost light, then the basement door. You think there's a connection? Connection? Yeah, the ghost light keeps the ghosts away, but somebody shattered it, so now the ghost is here. Ah, it makes sense when you say it all out loud like that. No, the ghost light is there to keep you from falling into the orchestra pit and breaking your stupid neck. Then why is it called a ghost light? I'm pretty sure it's because break your stupid neck light doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. I kinda like it. You're just being a spoilsport. No, I'm trying to figure out who broke the lock on the effing door. This is a real thing that really happened. You can't just break stuff around here. This place barely makes enough money as it is. He's just trying to take your mind off our ghost so that you can do your show. Wait, you actually have a ghost? - Yeah. - No. No, we do not have a ghost. This theater has a twisted history, man. She's a tragedy nut, King Lear's her favorite play. Gets me every time. Well, I'll pretend that makes sense to me. Good luck finding that ghost. You know about the story of what happened here? It's brutal and it's awesome. And it's not real. Shut up, Andy! You don't know that. It was probably Bryce that broke the lock, anyway. I'm good, actually. I have a show to get ready for. Do you actually think it was Bryce? Hey! Yo, Myles. Reggie Ray. The one and only. Oh, I'm a big fan. Kind words, man. Come on in, I thought we should get together and have a chat about how our big show's gonna go. Sure. So which one of my movies sold you on my comic genius? Kid's Quest? Tiny Ninjas? I think it was Time Leapers III. My nephews almost disowned me for that one. Part four wasn't bad, though. I'll take your word for it. So, listen, I had a chance to ask around about you. People say you're funny. You talked to my mother. Look at that line. Good stuff, Myles. I'd drop the "mother," though, too formal. "Mom" is shorter and funnier. Brevity, Myles. I'll try to keep that in mind. Hey, you wanna take advantage of the spread? They got some good stuff here. I never eat before a show. Listen, let's cut to the chase. Whose name is out there on the flyer? Both of ours. Really? Yeah. Yours is on top in the big letters, and mine is down below in tiny little letters. I must've missed that. But my point's the same. Whose name is on top in the big, bold letters? Oh, that's your name. Your name is on top in the big letters and... Whose name is at the bottom in the tiny, little letters? That's my name. Exactly. See, I've been doing these comedy shows longer than I've been doing these kids' movies, and these people are here to see my comeback. Naturally. But the opening act, I mean, it's important, too. You get to warm up the crowd. Everybody's psyched up for the big show. But don't overstep. Know your place. It's not easy to do, it takes a finesse. When looking at you, I know you're a man who knows his place. Thanks for the advice. Any time. I like to think of myself as a mentor. See, this business, it's got rules, and I just wanted to make sure that we got together and shared the same vision about how it's gonna go down tonight. Can you please excuse me now? I really gotta get ready for my set. Preparation is key. Break a leg, Myles. Hi, everyone, I'm Myles Parks. Reggie Ray can go fuck himself. Ooh, whoa, what's up with you? Pressure's really getting to you, huh? No. Dude, what's up? There's a dead body in my dressing room. No shit? Why would I joke about something like that? I don't know, 'cause you're a comedian and that's your job? Like I'm on the clock right now? Don't get upset. I dig it, it's my kind of humor. But if you think I'm really that gullible, you and Andy can go fuck yourselves. Nice try, though. Nelson, we need to talk. Okay. Sorry, he's a little bit... It's cool, I work in the theater. Everybody's got a crazy process. Nelson, you're not gonna believe this. No, you're not gonna believe this. No, listen, this is serious! Can it. Remember last night, I was telling you I was working on something big? - Yeah, I don't know. - Well, it came through. What are we talking about? Guess who's coming to the show tonight? Isabella Hooper. Who's Isabella Hooper? She's the booking agent for the Daily Dish. The Daily Dish? Every successful comic in the last decade got their start on the Daily Dish. Once you're in, you're in. Come here. Look at those people. If you impress those people tonight, your days of worrying about rent are over. Isabella Hooper, huh? True, my vision, my tenacity, it's partly responsible. But she's here for you. I'll show you. I sent her this. Remember that? Portland, '15. That was right before... Stop it. Before, before. It's before the medication. Myles, that's the Myles we need. That's the one that got Isabella's attention. And that's why I'm asking you to hold off on taking the pills, for one night. For this. You got one shot, and, if it doesn't land, there's no way I'm getting Isabella back for a second look. This is it, you understand? All right, good. Can I make a suggestion? Ditch the jacket. It looks like it's seen better days, and maybe those weren't too good, either. - See you. - Yeah. I'll figure something out. Hey. Nelson said you wanted to know about wardrobe? It's in the hallway on the other side of the theater, right before you get to the prop room. Right, thanks. Just doing my job. Hello? Hey. Are you the wardrobe guy? It's for a show next month. Not working? Is the character a '70s pimp? Whatever, yeah, I am the wardrobe guy. I was told I should maybe get a new jacket from you. That's good advice. A nice-fitting jacket goes a long way. Come on over, I'll measure you. You nervous? Why? Because you're sweating like two rats humping in a wool sock. Oh, yeah, I guess I am. I'll have to take one of our jackets in to fit you. Come back in a bit, and I'll have you set up. I appreciate it. There's a bathroom down the hallway. It's not much, but you can take a whore's bath there. Excuse me? You know, freshen up in the sink. Thanks. See you soon. What have you been doing? Just a little manual labor. Helps me loosen up before big shows. Manual labor? I was actually hoping to find some place to freshen up. Some place that's not a public restroom. I can help you with that. Follow me. Nice. It's my private bathroom. You're welcome to use it. Your door's broken. I never bothered fixing it, is that a problem? No, it's cool. It's totally all cool. Myles? Is somebody in here? Boo! What the fuck? Man! You're just here to see me with my shirt off. No, you're not really my type. Oh, because I'm a man? Hardy har, your lesbian joke is so antiquated. It's actually kinda cute, like a racist grandpa or something. You just called me cute. - I heard it. - Whatever. Donna wants to talk to you. She's up in her office. Thanks, I'll try not to remember that you called me cute. For the record, when I said you're not my type, I meant old. Ouch, I'm only 30. Yeah, exactly. I'll let you get back to wrestling with your mortality. Excuse me. What's up, man? Nothing. What's up with you? Yeah, I was just waiting for Donna. I had a few questions about, look, do you need... She was just right here. I guess I'll get out of your hair and let you finish up whatever is going on here, so. Andy, sit down. Myles, can I help you with something? I need a towel. There's one in there. Oh. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm Nelson, I manage tonight's opening act. Hey, man, that's awesome. Really, congratulations. Can you close the door behind you? I was told to talk to Bryce about music cues. I'm Bryce, I do the music cues. Who told you to come talk to me? Andy, the stage manager. Yeah, I know who Andy is. I work here, okay? Fucking Andy. Said he tried to call you on the radio. Oh, this piece of shit? Is there a problem? No, everything is swell, Nelson. So, do you have any specific sound cues in mind you want played for your talent? No, just whatever you think's best. Just whatever I think is best? Yeah, you're the sound guy. First of all, I'm not the sound guy, Nelson. I'm the deputy fucking stage manager. I run the whole show running through my hands. It's a lot of responsibility, and I take it very, very seriously. Thirdly, you come all the way up here just to tell me that you don't have any specific sound cues in mind? What's the second thing? Excuse me? You said, "first of all," and "thirdly," but you forgot the second thing. It was the thing about the, uh, clearly you weren't paying attention, which is my point. Stop wasting my time, and let me get back to work. Okay. You know, I was told to come by and check in with you, regardless, so. Oh, I'll be talking with Andy about this, don't you worry. I won't. I feel very confident knowing the show is in your hands. Thanks. Really needed that. Would you like a drink? Sure, why not? What are you working on? It's a play I'm writing. You write? That's great. Is it a comedy like, Moliere, was it? Good memory. Not exactly, no. What's it about? It's called Contrapasso. Contrapasso? It's from Dante's Inferno. It refers to the relationship between one's sins and their corresponding punishment in hell. The punishment must fit the crime. That's basically it, yes. Is the story personal? We all have crimes we want to atone for, don't we? Hey, have you seen or heard anything weird around here? Such as? Well, I heard this theater has some history. Tragic history. All theaters have history, Myles. Perhaps you should focus on your show tonight. Doors will open in 45 minutes. Try to stay out of trouble, okay? Jared? Is the jacket ready? Jared? Hey. Hey there. Where's Jared? He wasn't in here when I showed up. He said he'd have a jacket for me for the show tonight. When did he say that? Earlier. No! I mean, he's not in there. I was just using that to change. I told him to go talk to Donna and he never showed up. I'm sure he'll follow up with her eventually. What's this? It's mine. What is it? Medication. Medication, seriously? Yes, seriously. What do you have? You said this place had some tragic history. Yeah? I wanna know more. Okay. Let me take care of something first. Meet me in the basement. I like what you've done with the place. This is supposed to be where it all began. Where what began? In the early days, the theater employed company actors. The main actor and actress had been together for years. They even had a child. And people would come from all around to see them because they were so magnetic and wonderful, but that came with a price. One of the theater patrons, a widow, immensely wealthy, fell in love with the actor. So is she the ghost? The widow, no. The actress is the ghost, then. Maybe, shut up and listen. The actor decided to marry this widow for her money, and he wanted his girlfriend, the actress, to be his mistress, and he would care for her and the kids financially. That's pretty generous, actually. The actress didn't see it that way. She felt betrayed, she wanted revenge. So... She killed the kid and sent the body up on the stage during the performance. Dude, you ruined it! Yeah, this horrific story is totally ruined now. Yeah, sorry to gave away the ending, guys. I was setting it up so beautifully, too. So who is this ghost, the kid? Oh come on, it's all BS. Look, haven't you ever noticed it sounds an awful lot like Medea? Like Medea's Family Reunion? Dude, it's a fucking Greek tragedy. I thought it was a guy making jokes, dressed up like somebody's grandma. - I should watch those movies. - No, oh my God. You can at least admit, there's an uncanny resemblance. Life imitates art. I think you've got that backwards. Okay, so in this supposedly fake, maybe true, story, what happens next? Well, that's the best part. The actor was in the middle of his performance, and when he saw the body, he just snapped. He started laughing, and he never stopped. Not ever? Yeah, yeah, yeah, they evacuated the theater, and the actress accidentally locked herself down here. So who is the goddamn ghost? It's the actress, obviously. Tots obs, guys. Also obvious why a ghost would hurt a human. It's like you've never read a book or seen a movie. It's kind of sad. Okay, aren't ghosts non-corporeal? Oh, so you're a ghost hunter now? Did I miss your two am show on basic cable? There are different kinds of ghosts. Don't take it personally. She's always like this. Different kinds of ghosts? Yeah, like poltergeists or phantoms. Of the opera? You guys are stupid. All I'm saying is that unexplained deaths have happened in this theater, and, when they've happened, they've blamed it on Laughing Linda. Laughing Linda? That's a horrible name. I didn't name her. Why is she Laughing Linda? Wasn't he the one who didn't stop laughing? Shouldn't he be Laughing Larry? His name was Clifton. I think you're missing the point. Actually, I think you're both missing the point. This story is stupid, Bethany. Yeah, Bethany. You're the one who asked to hear it. Don't worry about her, she loves this kind of stuff. She would kill for something horrible to happen while she was here. Come on, I gotta lock the door. Shit! Fuck! Ants! Andy, do you copy? Andy, something spilled on the mixer. Cocksucker! - Donna's? - It could've been. Are you ignoring me? No. Where is everybody? Everybody who? Everybody! Okay, Bryce, you know it's a skeleton crew tonight. We're not putting on King Lear. Did you try your radio? Dude, I've been telling you, my radio's broken, and it's not like anyone else around here uses their radio. He's right, half the time I end up yelling into my headset at someone who's not even there. I look like a total douche bag. And that, dear Andy, is why I don't use mine. You're lucky you barely volunteer. Yeah, I'm real lucky. Hello! Can I help you with something? I might have... Do we have any backup mixers somewhere? Why? Well, do we? Yeah, probably. The basement? Hey, heads up, new lock on the door. Have fun, don't let Laughing Linda get you. He believes in it, too, you know he does. Fuck, goddamn it. Hello! I'm down here! Andy, quit fucking around. What the fuck? Some sort of Laughing Linda bullshit, Bethany? It's a good prank, but cut it out. Isabella. Miss Hooper. Hi, Miss Hooper, I'm Nelson Fritch, I'm Myles' agent. Yes, I know, I remember. Thank you so much for coming to the show tonight. He is really excited to have you here. I really appreciate it. Can I meet him before the show? I'd like to wish him luck. Sure, absolutely, follow me. Bryce. They're gonna come and find you. Right after the show, the cops will get an anonymous call, they're gonna come and get you, you son of a bitch! Not now! Hey, Myles, this is Isabella Hooper. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Parks. You seem to have gotten something on your shirt. Oh, well, just trying my best here. What? You're just not what I expected. Well, some performers just have a crazy process. So true, so true. Crazy process. Well, good luck tonight, Myles. I guess we'll see if this pans out. Myles. Hi, Donna. Everything okay? It's nothing. It's almost showtime for you. Whatever it is, you can tell me. The ownership is selling the theater. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. I really shouldn't be surprised. They never appreciated this place, not like I did. This theater is everything that I have always wanted. Maybe the new owners will keep you on. Oh, Myles, they're gonna tear it down. It's probably gonna be a condominium or parking lot. That's terrible, I'm sorry. You know, I shouldn't burden you with this. It's extremely unprofessional. Is there something I can help you with? I got a stain on my shirt. Oh, what? This? I wish I could help. You're very sweet. I'm sorry I was condescending earlier. I think I was worried that this show would be the last, and I took it out on you. I hope this show helps you find success. You deserve it. You're a good man, Myles. You deserve everything I am sure is coming to you. I hope not. WTF, Bryce, where are you? Hey, have you seen Bryce? No, not since he barged through the hallway in a hissy fit. He's not answering his radio. We need music out there, and I don't think anybody's manning the control booth. Well, I can't man the control booth, but I can woman it. Even better, thank you so much. - Seriously. - Yep. Hey, it's gonna be fine. We got this. We're not putting on King Lear, right? Yeah, thanks, Bethany. Hey, you know that I've always dug you, right? Dug, did you just say that you've always dug me? I don't know, it just kinda slipped out. - Sorry if I... - Hey, it's okay. I already know. Would you want to go out for drinks after this, maybe? I don't drink. Oh, okay, yeah. But we can get high in my car if you want. Yeah, that sounds nice. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Okay, cool. - Cool. I'll see you after the show. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. Did I see what I think I saw? Is that a tongue twister? What? You know, to help you prepare, loosen up the tongue. I always say, I'm not the fig plucker, nor the fig plucker's son, but I'll pluck figs til the fig plucker comes. See, it's funny 'cause you end up saying "pig fucker." Cut the shit. I saw Isabella Hooper with your agent. How'd you get her here, huh? She's here to see you? She's here to give me a spot on the Daily Dish. Oh yeah? And when I upstage you, how's that gonna play out? Well, she's here looking for stand-up comedians, so I'm not all that worried. I am a comedian! No, you were a comedian until you sold out to make a bunch of shitty, big budget, family movies that are painfully unfunny. Meanwhile, you cash big ass checks with sums that you think somehow correlate to your talent and can't figure out why everyone else thinks you're washed up and depressing. Well, good luck on your victory tour. The audience might be disappointed, but maybe you can convince yourself, with one last check, that you've still got it. You're a piece of shit. There is such a thing as comedy karma, you know. Clearly, you would know. Fuck you, Myles! Fuck you! Donna? Hello. We are ready to go out there. Donna? Hey, look, Donna, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I think we're about ready to get started out there. Ew. Bethany here. I found Bryce's headset. Queuing music now. Shit. Bryce. Hey, moron. My work here is done, Handy Andy. Nelson, listen... I don't wanna talk to you right now, Myles. Excuse me? You're acting crazy with Isabella. I don't need this. Isn't this how you wanted me, more edgy? I'm funnier when I'm an asshole, right? You're not just being an asshole. I don't know what this is. I've never seen you like this before. What's going on? So now you wanna listen to me? Don't you wanna tell me how it's just my nerves? Fuck you, okay? I'm doing everything I can here to set you up for success. You're talented, I think you're talented. I just want them to know, too. So it's all for me, right, you get nothing out of this? What is wrong with you? You know what, I took my pills, Nelson. I took them. They didn't help. But at least you don't have to worry about me. I'm still an asshole... I gave you sugar pills! I switched them out. I took the bottle. I thought, if you didn't take them for a few hours, it'd be no big deal. Okay, you wanna know what's really going on? You think you can handle it? I'm willing to do whatever it takes for our big night. Are you? It was here. No, it wasn't, Myles. You don't understand. I might, try me. I know you think this is about Mia, but it's not. Let's not talk about that right now, okay? You're going on in 15 minutes. Well, I'll try my best. I was trying to help you. You understand that, right? Look, whatever shit you've done, I've done way worse. I could use a drink. Talk to Donna. I'm sure she'd be happy to share. All right. I think we both could use one. I'm good, you go ahead. All right, I'll see you after the show. Good luck, Myles. Hello? Donna? Myles, Myles, who did this, Myles? Myles. Oh my God. Fuck you. No! I'm serious, Myles, you better not fuck this up! I'm the headliner! Oh, my fucking career's over. You killed her. You killed her. Who are you? That's funny. The best music. Hey, radio lovers, Jay Barilla here. Man, the story breaking this morning about the tragedy at the Reggie Ray show. Can you believe this? Last night, around the time the show was starting, the curtains parted to reveal the opening act, Myles Parks, murdered on the stage. By the way, had anybody heard of this Myles Parks guy before? I hadn't, so I looked him up, and he has, had, real talent. Ever since the news of his murder broke, this video on YouTube of a performance of his at a Portland nightclub in 2015 has been blowing up. This guy is, was, really, really funny. His video is, let me see here, wow, it's up to two million views and climbing. If you get a chance to check it out, don't hesitate. This is one of the funniest sets I've seen in a long time. It's funnier than anything Reggie Ray has done in decades, I can tell you that much. Anyway, the official word is that there may be more victims in last night's tragedy, but the police are keeping a tight lid on the story at the moment. Okay, back to some music. This next song is called Short Night by the band Glass Dolls. Stay safe out there, folks. There might be a killer on the loose.
