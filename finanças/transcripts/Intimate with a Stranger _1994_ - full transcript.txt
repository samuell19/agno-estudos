[sensual music] [phone ringing] [man over answering machine] Hi, this is Jack. I'm not home right now, so maybe you can call me back. [answering machine beeps] [woman] Jack, I was just... I don't know... Was there something weird about me? I hear my friends talk, and I read things. It's not like that for me. Everybody seems to be doing it. I know. I just want to know if I'm okay. [answering machine beeps] [woman] Hi, Jack, isn't it? I'm a friend of Diane's, and she said I should get in touch, that, you know, you might be able to accommodate me. Anyway, I know the score. I have to call again. [answering machine beeps] [woman] I'm in love with someone, Jack. And it is not my husband. Oh, it is so hard to be a married woman these days, Jack! [answering machine beeps] [woman] It's never just sex, is it, Jack? I mean, there's always something more involved. It can never just be sex. [answering machine beeps] [man] Hello, Jack. You do men? [phone ringing] Hi, this is Jack. How can I help? [woman] Is that Jack? Sure. What can I do for you? [woman] I'm sorry, did I get you up? -Not yet. -[woman] I didn't mean that. -[woman] Listen, this -- -Hey, hey, wait up. Don't be embarrassed. Are you're still there? [woman] Yes. Okay, good, relax. It's just like a late-night radio phone in. [woman laughs] Oh, sure. Try me. What's your name? [woman] Summer. Uh-huh... [woman] It's my real name. Okay, well, tell me something about real Summer. [woman] What? I don't know. Tell me... Tell me what's on your mind right now. -[woman] Right now? -Right this very second. [woman] Right now. Right now... I feel like I'm just about the dumbest 18-year-old in Santa Monica. That's okay. [Jack] Eighteen? And the best-looking woman I've spoken to all day. [woman laughs] Yeah, like it's nine in the morning. That doesn't make for big competition. [Jack] No, but it doesn't make -you eighteen either. -[woman] But... I am. [Jack] Whatever you want to say. [woman] Okay, okay. I get it. Like... [clears throat] Like, I can be whoever. [Jack] Right. You can tell me whatever. [woman stammering] You are nice. Maybe. [woman] So, what do we do next? That's up to you. You pick a day. I give you the address. We take it from there. -[woman] Okay. How much is it? -Two fifty cash. [woman] Oh, whoa! I don't suppose there's a student rate? In my hands, everyone learns something. [woman giggles] I hope so! No, sorry. I didn't mean that. I meant, like-- Okay, okay. Saturday. How about Saturday, maybe? Let me see. [Jack] It's 1720 Idaho. Is three okay with you? [woman] Is that it? We've got a date? -We have an appointment. -[woman] Oh, yeah right. [upbeat jazz music] [music continues] [music stops] [woman] Sex? [chuckles] What does anybody know about sex? I mean, my parents never told me anything. Their single attempt at talking to me involved asking me if there's anything I didn't know. To which I replied, “I don't know.” And we left it at that. First time I did it, was total disaster. He only got in like an inch before it was all over. I figured if I went all the way, you know, at least it would have bells on or something. How can anybody know anything about something nobody talks about? Not even two people doing it together talk about it. [Jack] Hi. Summer, right? So, you made it. Are you gonna be okay? Then, I guess you can let go of my hand. So, what do we do next? I mean, what-- What do I do? Anything. It's up to you. Okay, like, I pay whatever happens, right? -Right. -Right. -Let's get on with it, then. -Hey, hey, hey. Why are you here? I'm not just a kid. I think it's important for me to know. Yeah, well... I know what I'm doing. Sure. If you don't, nobody else does. I've thought about this, you know, a lot. Hey, I'm not touching you, okay? Okay. I want my first to be someone I don't know. You know, someone... someone who won't go around bragging about how he was my first. My best friend spent hers on a piece of trash. And I am not about to do the same. You're not as good looking as I thought you'd be. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. [stammers] They say you're the best, you know? I know what they say. Yeah, you come highly recommended. [sighs] Look, what a guy doesn't know can hurt me, you know? [stammers] I just don't want to be that dumb. It's society's fault! [Jack] Naturally. Well, it is because, you know, girls are trying to be good and... guys are supposed to be, like, experienced, so they're-- They're all trying to get experience with girls who are trying to be good. [nervously] Okay. I mean, I don't blame them, you know, because-- I mean, a 17-year-old guy is labeled a fruit if he is still a virgin, so... He's under some heavy pressure to get his rocks off. You know, he's desperate to lay anything except the cocktable for dinner. [laughs embarrassedly] So... You figure guys are trying to get experience -at your expense? -Yeah. Yeah, like, it's real static, you know? Because... all the guys I know... you're in danger of catching diaper rash from. -[giggles] -And what about love? Love... It's not love. And because it's free, you know, it's worse than a favor. Once you do it with someone, you... -can't go back to holding hands. -That's right. [nervously] [seriously] That's exactly it. So, what makes you think that I'm what you want? [laughs nervously] [stammering] I figured you get what you pay for. [Jack] I don't think you're truly that cynical. I'm really nervous. I know. [bed creaking] [whispering] Okay. [Jack] Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy. The only rule of the game is... -the condom. -[chuckles] [Jack] This is the point of no return. Before things get carried away, you bring up the subject. -Always or go home, you hear? -Mm-hmm. Okay. [Jack] Hey, look at me. Don't go soft on me now. -Pick one. -[laughs] [Jack] Go on! [softly] Close your eyes. [loudly] Oh, God! It looks like a 1950's B movie monster... [Jack] Okay. Birthday money. Not quite what your parents had in mind, huh? Jack... Do you ever, like, fall in love with clients? No. You ever been in love? -Sure. -Yeah? Was she pretty? Jack... Can I see you again? Anytime. No... No, I mean, like-- Nice compliment, but it's just a job. [whimpers softly] And I was getting to like you. [Jack] Take it easy. Hey, it's okay. Summer... If you want to talk, or I don't know. -You can call, okay? -Okay. Be careful. Be careful. [answering machine beeps] [woman] Lover boy, it's me. Pick up, baby. You know, I need you. [pleadingly] I need you to talk me down. You there? [moans softly] Please, baby. Baby, come right now. All over my fingers. Just talk to me. You know how I like it. You there for me? [whimpers] Damn you! [angrily] Where are you? I hate the way you make me feel. Who needs you? I swear, this is the last time I do coke on my own! [jazz music] [engine starting] [music continues] [engine humming] [Barbara] Hi, honey, I'm home! [sensual music] [Barbara] I know you don't mind, do you? Sorry, I was just taking a leak. Party pooper. Tell me next time. I'll come and hold it for you. [Jack] I like a girl who shows initiative. I've shown you everything I've got. [Jack] You still surprise me, Barbara. I hope what I brought in my bag is a surprise. [seductively] Come here. [Barbara giggling and panting] [Barbara] Jack! [slap] [Barbara laughing] Come on, then. [Barbara] Neck. I'm ready for dessert now. Let's see what you brought me this week. [electronic buzz] [moaning intensely] Oh, Jack! [buzzing continues] -That's you finished. -[Barbara] Not quite. -Oh, no. -[Barbara giggles] Next time, will you throw in a leg wax for the same price? So... Can I stay this time? I don't sleep on the job. Or drink? You know the answer. Don't you want to wake up with a warm, soft woman beside you? [Jack] Only one I really care about. No offense taken. Just in case you were wondering. Is there one? Well? [Jack] Women ask so many questions. She's very lucky. Well, maybe she doesn't think so. [knocking on door] Who is it? [romantic music] Hello, Jack. Michelle. You seem surprised. You could say that. Can I come in? Sure. [Jack] So, what's new? [Michelle] Everything. And you? [Jack] I don't know where to begin. [Michelle] Try at the beginning. You were there. [Michelle] You look really good, Jack. Yeah, well, I work out now. [Michelle] So, are you pleased to see me? You should have called. I didn't have your number. Although I hear it's widely available. So, you know what I do? I'm still here. Why? [softly] I don't know. Let's not do this. Do what? Hate each other. [Michelle] What are they like? -Who? [Michelle] The women that come to you. Ordinary. [Michelle] How do they know about you? By recommendation. Are they-- Most of them just want to talk. About what? Their relationships. You must be quite an expert by now. I think you learn from your own mistakes. [Michelle] Do you find them sad? No! Why are you doing this? That's none of your business anymore. -You are worth so much more. -So much you left me. No. I left the man you became. [Jack] Oh! And who was that? Different from the man I fell in love with. [loudly] Don't... [softly] judge me. [Michelle] Just tell me why. Why now? Or why then? I don't know. Are you coming back? Back to what? Away from this! And then? Be the teacher you always wanted to be. You've got it all worked out. It's not impossible. I teach, uh-huh? [Jack] "Oh, him! The guy that has got no status, no earning power. The one that doesn't move in the right circles, doesn't have influential friends." Etcetera, etcetera. [shouting] Is that the one you mean? It's who you are. No. No! You're wrong. A job isn't who you are. [Jack] You say, “Who is that?” “That's Jack from next door.” “What is he?” “He was a bright, young professor of philosophy.” A job title, so what? For me, that was something complicated by PhDs, campus politics, and research papers right up to my back! Worth as much as 250 sheets per roll of two-ply toilet paper. And, oh, yes! [Jack] Occasionally, the students get in the way... and you gotta stand up and babble at them. Goddammit. I did everything for you... for us, for the all-important future. Yes, you did do everything except ask me what I wanted. I gave you... everything! [voice breaking] And then you took it away. Slowly. You took my control of my life away from me. So, who was I with then? Who was it enjoying the academic social life? The big names on the party lists, huh? There was nothing I could do. You don't believe me anymore. Is that a problem? [softly] Goddamn you. You're doing a fine job! Why don't you just hold the door open for me? I don't recall sending you an invitation to come back into my life! Oh, I'll leave if that's what you want. No! Leave if that's what you want. I am not responsible for this! I don't hold you... responsible. [phone ringing] Go on. Answer it. That's what you do, isn't it? [ringing continues] [Michelle] Go on. [Jack] Hi. [woman] Can I talk to Jack? [Jack] Not right now. Can you get back to me? I just have to deal with something. [woman] But I was told-- [dramatic music] [banging] [Jack shouting] Damn! [fast-paced music] [engine humming] [music continues] [ringing] [Jack] Hi, this is Jack. How can I help you? [woman] Hi, Jack. Can I see you this week? Let me go see. No, it looks like I'm right out of time. Why don't you give me a call next week, and I'll see what I can do? [woman] Oh, I'm sorry. Believe me, I'm sorry, too. To "Live and die in Aristotle's works." [woman] Hell, we used to be at it like two dogs in season. We'd book into a motel room and we'd go for seven hours straight at a time. I mean, I'd limp out of that motel room. And now... Zip. Nothing. I mean, how can you not blame yourself when you go from seven hours straight to nothing? It doesn't matter what he says. First it's one thing, then another. It doesn't matter how many times I try to change those things or do them different. There's always another thing. He says, I always want to do it right in the middle of a Raiders game. If it's not the Raiders, then it's the Dodgers. Actually, it's any sport that's on. And we got cable and satellite and all the regular channels pumping up the wires into the tube. You can find it on TV anytime. I mean, it's like he's not heard of videotape! Look, I don't mean that sex is the main thing. It only becomes the main thing when there's no thing of it. When it's not happening. His lack of emotion makes me feel like a cheap one-nighter. I mean, I don't understand! If I'm his wife, and he says he loves me... why can't he satisfy my needs? [woman] Ain't you just a little curious, how come a married lady is here at night? [Jack] You have your reasons. I've never done this before, you know? [Jack] You're a virgin, then? [woman laughs] Hell, no! I've got three kids. I love sex. Do you change your sheets? I know, I know. [chuckles] I'm such a housewife. It's the truth! Marriages may be made in heaven, but beds are made here on earth... by women like me. [woman sighs] I got married because... it made it okay. To have sex? Yes. [sarcastically] I see it's working out. [loud chuckle] How can you expect a man who can't find that big laundry basket in the corner of the room to even begin to locate a teeny weeny, little bitty clit? [woman giggles] Does my language offend you? No. I don't talk like this at home. Why not? The kids! Well... My husband's the sort... Well, if I had any suggestions, he's up there saying, “Who's doing this, you or me?” Hell, sometimes... I don't even know if he's fucking me or masturbating. What do you do? [woman] Fake it. What do you think? Is that a good thing? It's a lost cause. He thinks if he tunes my nipples in, like two dials on a radio, I have an orgasm. Why do you do it? [resignedly] To get it over with. It's okay to like sex. Oh, really? He'd think I was a whore. [Jack] Do you talk to him? [woman] It's not that I won't talk to him. It's that he won't listen. [Jack] And... Is that the only problem? Oh, no. [woman] But... The lack of sex in a marriage leads to other problems. Because if you believe he's withholding sex from you, then, you tell yourself all these reasons why it's happening. And? “I've got unbearable cellulite.” "My cooking's lousy.” Or... “Did I do the right thing 11 years ago?” What? By marrying him? [woman] Oh, yeah. All that goes through your mind because you think there's something terribly wrong with you. Sex is a very... validating experience, for me. Can't speak for anyone else. Sure. It's a way of communicating. [Jack] What do you fantasize about during sex? [woman] I don't fantasize when I'm having sex. Frankly, there isn't time. [laughing] [pleasurably] Oh, my goodness! [Jack] Tell me what you want. -[woman] In bed? -[Jack] Sure. I want all that kissy, huggy kind of stuff. Giggling. [both giggle] I want the passion. Experimenting, lusting, sharing. [gasps excitedly] [panting] But most of all... I want to overflow... [excitedly] over and over. In other words, I want a lot more than I'm getting at home. [laughing] I'm sorry. I'm boring you. No, I was... You reminded me of somebody. I've considered divorcing him, twice. Why, just because of the sex? The only reason. It's the only reason. Oh, that feels good. I hope you don't think I'm being disloyal. I'd hate you to think that. -Doesn't matter what I think. -But it does. I'm not a cold person. I know. [floor boards creak] [both laugh] [woman] I did have an affair. I suppose to prove I was still attractive to others or to recapture my reckless youth. What happened? -[woman] When? -When-- -Oh! -[both laugh] He couldn't last long. Wasn't as good-looking as my husband. Hardly creative and, you know, he wasn't that... big, and... Anyway... I don't know why I bothered with him. The risk of being found out and jeopardizing my marriage. And for what... a lousy fuck? [woman] It's just that... Sex is my story, too. I wanna participate. and that seems to be creating a whole new... script. [giggles] Try me. [chuckles] That was some button-pushing. Maybe your husband could-- Please. Truth is, I'm supposed to do all the initiating when... if... [sighs] We did it every day for a while. And then, it turned into three times a week. And then, it just dwindled until it-- How does that happen? You miss a night, and soon it's a week. And before long, it's two weeks. And then, before long it's a month! A month! Then how long? Longer. -What then? -[woman] I actually... tried scheduling sex into the week, so it'd happen! [laughing] What, you marked the calendar? No. We'd have our days. I'd get sex on my days. He didn't have to on his. But that lasted about a week. I spent the first three years of my married life pregnant. [laughs] Come on. You must have been doing something right. That was the problem. It seemed like we were getting it right every time. [laughing] Think he began to see me more as a... mother than a wife. And you don't have sex with mommy. Yeah, right. Once the kids have sucked on them, they aren't sexy anymore. Yes, they are. Why don't you try taking some time out, you know? Phone off the hook. -Shipping the kids out, maybe? -[woman scoffs] Right. The other night, the excuse was he had a sour stomach, and he was afraid he'd throw up. [scoffs and laughs] God! [jazz music] [phone ringing] Shit! Hi, this is Jack. How can I help? [Michelle] Jack. -Michelle, I was just-- -[Michelle] I actually don't-- [laughs] Go ahead. [Michelle] I just wanted to apologize. Accepted. [Michelle] Well, that was all, really. Michelle... Would you like, dinner? [piano music] To friends, maybe. I like that. [Michelle] May I? Sure. I have nothing to hide from you any longer. What were you hiding before? Almost everything, I guess. You were hiding that from yourself. So! I hope I'm not interrupting anything this evening. Michelle. [scoffs] [piano music] [inaudible] Do you ever mix business -with pleasure? -Pleasure. They always get around to asking that. Sorry. No... [Jack] is the answer. [knocking on door] [imitating Chinese accent] Hello. Serving will be dinner for two person minimum. [laughs] [jazz music] [Michelle] You're talking as though it was yesterday. It's been 18 months. A lot's happened. You and I have changed. You know, I have to ask. What? About this. There wasn't much point to anything when you weren't around any longer. And? This was all an accident. I met this guy... an escort. He did okay. I wasn't really serious, and one night I got really loaded. The money was on the table in the morning. After that, everyone is a friend of a friend. It's all very innocent. Pro forma. Seemed easier than... It has a transience. [Jack] Those last grains of rice. [Michelle laughs] They're the bits you've got to have. [Jack] We all want what's hard to get. [Michelle] Sometimes they're the only things worth having. It never seems important at the time. Do you remember the day we found that? [Jack] Sure. We have some good memories. We used to go there... to get away. We used to go there to be together. What are we doing? [phone ringing] Michelle... do you know what a half-life is? I am sure I soon will. It's the time during which a radioactive substance loses have its power. Come again? Let's say uranium has a half-life of 100 years. Mm-hmm. [Jack] That means it'll take 100 years for its power to decrease by half. Nothing can alter that. Some things have a half-life of... nearly forever. Are you saying that's what we have? I'm just saying that some things can't be changed. They just are. Can we control it? We can try. I don't know. Becoming romantic with time, Jack. [soft jazz music] This isn't good. Should we be doing this? I don't understand. Neither do I. I just know that it's not right. It's not fair. -Michelle, I-- -It's okay, Jack. Don't say anything you'll regret. We deserve more. I know. Well... I guess this is my cue to leave. [scrapping] It was a lovely evening. Really. Michelle-- Yes? [soft music] [waves crashing] [seagulls cawing] [toilet flushes] [Jack] Hi. Oh... Hi. You must be Ellen. You canceled a couple of times. [Jack] Problems? Nah. You're not a big talker, are you? I didn't realize I was here to talk. Most women do. What about? Their husbands usually. You have some interesting books. Faustus. The man who sold his soul to the devil. We've all sold something. [speaking French] For lack of something better. I thought you didn't want to talk. I don't. I'm sorry, I can't do this. Oh, dear. Your lucky day. -Thank you. -What for? Understanding. I don't. Well, it's a long and a very tedious story. I'm not sure that this is the time of the place. Sometimes we're so afraid we don't see things for what they are. -I better go. -[Jack] No, Ellen, wait. -No, really, I've-- -You loved him very much. [sobs] [Ellen] Too much. [continues sobbing] Not enough. He left me last year. I'm sorry. Now I'm alone. I miss him. I knew it would happen. We both did, but it's just that, when it happened... I wasn't a really ready. He was too young. Do you want to tell me? We met in ‘69. I was 19 and on vacation in London for the summer. There was some... There was some concert in Hyde Park, and-- Oh, just about everybody in the whole world was there. He strolled right up it to me, and he asked me to dance. Right there in the open, outside. Imagine that. Of course, there were lots of people dancing, but... but he asked me, and I felt... so especial. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with that man. It sounds crazy nowadays, but... [Ellen] We were like teenagers for the next ten years, And then... [sighs] Well... At first, he would get dizzy. I told him to go to the doctor. The day they diagnosed-- Well, we didn't even know what MS was. They had to explain it. You don't die of it. It's just terminal. [scoffs] What the difference is somebody really ought to tell me now. So, then he got worse over the years. Until he couldn't move it all. He'd just... stared at the wall day in, day out. I had to do everything for him. Couldn't look at me. He was always the big, beautiful bear I saw day in London. Hyde Park. He lay there with a single tear rolling down his cheek. And he said to me, “Ellen, I want to kill myself. If you love me, please don't try to stop me.” [sobs] I'll never forget how I felt. He died in my arms. I held him like a baby all night. I told him everything was going to be all right. I love him. [sobbing] And I miss him. So... That's where I come in. Someone to hold you. I guess so. Do you really think this is what he would want for you? Do you really think that he'd want you here with me? Ellen, listen to me. This is a betrayal of love, being here. I know what I'm talking about. You have so much love, he'd he'd want you to find someone to give it to. -Don't wanna love somebody else. -[Jack] I think you do. It's what he would want. You'll always love him. He knows that. You're a little too smart for someone your age. Hey... I just watch a lot of Oprah . [Ellen] I don't think so. I'm just what you see. There's no charge. I insist. No, really. [Ellen] Looks like you've got a busy week. Looks like. Take care, Jack. You never know how long you have the good times for. [Ellen] Don't leave it too late. [sad music] [phone ringing] -Yo! -[Annette] That's not your usual call, Jackie. Oh, Annette, go away. [Annette] Jackie, baby, what's up? Nothing I wouldn't rather be left alone with. [Annette] It's not good to be alone and sober. I'm not. [phone ringing] Yes, Annette. [Annette] You want me to bring over a little pick me up? Narcotics are illegal. [Annette] Reality is too hard for some of us. Yeah, right. [phone ringing] [Annette] Will you quit doing that? I don't have to deal with you, Annette. [sad music] “Ugly hell, gape not! Come not, Lucifer! I'll burn my books!” Shit! [scoffs] I can't remember it. [music continues] [jovial music] [Michelle] Just happened to be looking my best. [Michelle] Happened to be in the neighborhood. Why am I back? Do I want this? Yes. Yes. [knocking on door] [Michelle] Hi! I'm on a peace mission. [kiss] [Michelle] I thought I'd cook for you. Actually, it's deli-ready, but it's the thought. We've got shrimp. [Michelle] We've got rye bread. We've got tortilla ! [Michelle] And the wine is cold. [Michelle] Okay, well, the food's not that important. [Michelle] Though it's gonna be great. And, the wine is not a $6 bottle. It's right across town for this. Michelle-- I think we should take a chance. No, I think we need a chance to talk if you want to. -[Michelle] I mean, a lot-- -Michelle! God... [laughing] Yes? I think I made a mistake. I'm sorry, I should have... God, I'm so stupid! -[Michelle] I thought-- -No, Michelle. Of course, is this-- "Well, for $250, you, too, can have it, Michelle!" [Michelle] I'm sorry. [door slam] I'm sorry, too. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Are you going out of business, Jack? I didn't say that, just... [buzzing] It's not healthy. Jack... It's got no attachments. Isn't that the point? It's the way I like it. We're not talking about one of your toys, Barbara. You're free. No roots, no ties. Just getting by. You should find yourself a boyfriend. Where do you get off telling me? I just... haven't the energy for it. No bullshit, Jack, at least this is honest. Well, what if I go away or something? Are you? [Jack] No, but... just say something happens? That's okay. Jack, you're cute. But you're hardly the last post or anything. I like you. You're fun! -But I-- -I figured... No. Nope? You really know how to hurt a guy. You go if you have to. Women are confusing. I just don't need you. [woman] There's one thing I'd really like to do. I mean, I don't know how or when. But I wanna make love with a woman... real bad. I want us to be together, to lie together. I'd her like to... suck on my nipples. And I'll just feel her soft back. And then, I would start to... lick and nibble and suck... on her clit... and on her nipples until they were rock hard. And I would just feel her juice running down my chin. I want to know what carpet munching tastes like. [upbeat jazz music] Hi. Hello. Let's make puppies! [barking] [inaudible] [music continues] [Annette] Baby, you're home! [Jack] Annette. [Annette] Jackie, baby... I miss you. -[Jack] So, you tell me. -[Annette] I love you! [Jack] Annette, are you high? [Annette] No, baby. This is a real low. I need you! -[Jack] Yeah, right. -[Annette] Really! [Annette] Jackie, you there? I know you are. I gotta tell you-- Jackie? I'm pregnant. Annette, it's late. [Annette] Really, Jackie. I'm gonna have a baby! Congratulations. [Annette] It's your baby! You're gonna be a daddy. -Fuck you, Annette! -[Annette] Baby, it's true! You can't wrap that on me, Annette. You know, I use industrial-strength condoms. We don't kiss, and I don't come. Get yourself a life, Annette. Don't call me until then. Jesus, women! [woman] Look... your sex organs are on the outside. All you've gotta do is feel a tight ass shifting up against you in a crowd and you're gonna come. A woman's like a pot of stew. You've gotta warm her up a while before she's bubbling. Listen, if a woman isn't sexually satisfied, she is going to become scrunchy, tetchy, a crab. Now, if you keep her denied... Well! You know... I'd like to see a man go six months or a year or five years without an orgasm. You'd sure see how cranky he'd be. But a woman who doesn't have an orgasm when she makes love to her man, and he does, that's a woman. If he leaves his socks on the floor, she's gonna flip. I mean, she is gonna be a total wreck. She is! So, God forbid he should come home late. I mean, she's really gonna shake the salt out and yell at him. Alright. Let's take the reverse of that. You putting her under performance pressure. You are gonna make her come if you have to pump her ‘till she's raw. Normally, foreplay means you finger her 'till she's [scoffs]... damp. And you fumble around on top, and you expect her to have a big "oh!" It may be that technically you're a whiz. But you've got to emotionally connect, engage her as a human being. You can't just do the man thing or be a machine, right? [woman] You've got to communicate. [thunderclap] [Jack] I thought you weren't gonna show. [Vicki] So... I'm a little late. That's a problem? [Jack] No, no, just recognized. [Vicki] You have a bathroom? Some place I can put my flexible friend in. [Vicki] And I prefer my brand choice. [Jack] It's included in the price. There are diseases in the city. [Jack] I don't have those problems. None of them ever do. Until you find yourself in line at the clinic. [Vicki] Besides, how do I know you're not a psychotic bastard and poked holes in every one? [water running] My parents were married. [Vicki] Cute. Very cute. Do you go out of your way to be offensive or is it a natural talent? Payment will be on delivery. [sarcastically] Yes, ma'am. [Vicki] I know the old wompity womps easier. But I'm hoping you, at least show a little imagination for the price. Am I getting the static for men in general or one specific man? [Vicki] What? -So, you got hurt. -[Vicki] Oh... -Spare me the amateur analysis. -I'm right, right? It's a cheap shot! It could be true for so many women. [Jack] So, it's one man in all of them. [sighs] [Vicki] Men are hardly relevant. Obviously, you haven't found an alternative. [Vicki] With a career, you know where you stand. -A career cares for you? [Vicki] It allows me -to care for myself. -Sure. It gives me the power to buy what makes me happy. So, is that what you're doing here? [scornfully] Fuck you. No, fuck you is what I do. Chickenshit dick for rent. What man makes the grade, Vicki? Only money makes the grade. -Oh, how very grown up, now. -What a crock! [Vicki] Men have their criteria, too. It's okay to reject a woman based on her figure. It's all just based on a figure. And what does it buy? Buys my time. What about you? Not everything's for sale. Oh? [thunderclap] Independence has its price, too, you know? You're tugging at my strings. You are taking up my time. It's a buyer's market! [rustling] I've paid the organ grinder. So, now the monkey dances. He doesn't feel like it. [Vicki] What's the problem? Not man enough for it? There has to be an element of mutual respect -for it to work. -[Vicki] What? [Vicki] Are afraid that you can't make it with me? That I'm too much woman for you? You're one hard-boiled bitch. I... like me. -Sure. -What do you know? I know what I see. You... like yourself? Bingo! You... are a dick for rent. Nobody. You were leaving. What are you waiting for, Jacko? [mockingly] Love? Love is all there is. You couldn't commit to something as big as that. Take a look. What is all this, mm? Nada . -Will you just-- -What's the matter, Jacko? You don't like your tiny, little world getting messed up? [ominous music] Here is news for you... It is anyway. You push the self-destruct button. It's just a slow fuse to hell, from now on. There's no place for you to go. This is all there is. You haven't the first idea. Yes, I do. You're just like me. I don't think so. What have you got... that's worth anything. Not one of the pieces in here. [thunderclap] [Vicki] Good catch! How many women did it take to buy that? Whatever you have comes down to the price of what's in your pants. What did this take? A weekend? [music continues] -[Vicki] What's this worth? -Put it back. Teenage sweetheart, mm? First love? What do you do? You screw other women to pay -for your dates with her? Nice. -Just put it back. Does she respect you? That's none of your damn business! -Just a little unprofessional. -I don't give a shit! [Vicki] My, my! I never had you figured for a cheap sentimentalist. -Put the picture down. -[Vicki] Ooh, touchy! -Just put that you down. -[Vicki] Why? Put it down! Make me! Put the gun down. Put the goddamn gun down, Vicki. No, Jack. This is my game. You... Strip. I said strip, Jacko. It's what you're paid for. Just put the gun down. -Strip. -You, crazy bitch! Fucker, get undressed! Put the goddamn gun down! Get your fucking pants off! What are you gonna do, huh? -[Vicki groans] -Shoot me? [softly] Go ahead, try me! You like this game, huh? [Vicki whimpers] [shouting] You think I give a shit? [crying] Please, don't. I never wanted this. [sighing nervously] That was... [Vicki moaning excitedly] [Jack] It's funny, isn't it? How you can never say what you want to say to a person. You can sit in a room with a complete stranger and tell them, well... the most intimate details of your life. You can find the words. The right words. But how it's impossible to tell the person who really matters the truth. You know, if you want to say to someone, “This isn't working.” It's not easy. Or if you want to say, you know, "This is really good. I--" It's even harder. What you trade for this is more time spent with... the tension between you. So, you live a lie. And no matter how small it is, it grows. And soon, it becomes stronger and bigger than the two of you. Until eventually... everyone loses. You can be intimate with a stranger, but... a stranger to intimacy. Right. World peace is one thing, but this... This is something else. Anyway... that's just about all I wanted to say. Gotta go. [nostalgic music] Hello, operator, I'm looking for someone. [operator] Ain't we all, honey? How can I help? Right, well, I need an address. Can you give me that from a name? [operator] I can't give you that. Period. [operator] Even if you is a name. -What if-- -[operator] I can't help! Look, maybe whoever it is don't wanna be found. You think of that? Yeah, right. Thanks anyway. [phone ringing] [woman] Hi, is that, you know, Jack? No, Jack doesn't live here anymore. [nostalgic music] [Jack] Hi. Hello. [Jack] I didn't know if you'd be here. Well, I am. Did you know that I would come? No. Are you okay? In some ways. Course. So... What are you doing here? Is it just a coincidence? I can't do all the work, Jack. Don't make me. -I have to go. -[Jack] Michelle. You know why. No, Jack. I don't know anything. You're all that I have that's worth anything. Look... I should have thought about this before I came, maybe wrote a little speech or something. But I didn't, and... Michelle... I might mess this up, but it makes me nervous. Am I stupid to still be here? I don't know. I'm not sure we didn't already blow it. I don't think so. Do you love me, Jack? Come on, Jack. You know what it isn't. Well? [laughs] God... Jack! What? You wanna hear me say it? If you do. You'll never know what I think of you, Michelle. It's not good enough. I love you. Good. See? That was easy. So... what now? I'm not sure the rules have changed. I'm not sure we can work it out. It's the only thing worth believing in. I got a teaching post in the college. [Jack] They didn't ask what I've been doing the last year. So... you know where I'll be. [Michelle] Jack... I'm sorry. It's okay. I don't blame you. Can I give you a ride somewhere? No. No, I'll make my own way. I've never decided where I'm going. [piano music] [engine starting] Are you going my way? [jovial music]
