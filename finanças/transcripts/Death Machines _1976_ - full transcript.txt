(eerie dramatic music) (light oriental music) (gunshot) - They will do nicely. - [Man] Sit down. Well? - The drug worked as you said it would. They are completely under our control. - [Man] You mean my control? - Of course. - [Man] These three men will form the nucleus of the most deadly group of assassins the world has ever known. Three of the deadliest men in the world, programmed to kill on my command. Death machines. I've worked years for this and these men must be perfect. - They are. - [Man] So you say, before I put them into action, I think you should run them through another set of experimental tests. That man and his people will be a good test. He's part of an old and obsolete organization. - It will be done. - [Man] And so it shall be. - Yeah George, this is Mr. G. Listen I got two jobs for you, same price. Number one, a Chinese gentleman by the name of Ho Lung, runs a karate studio in your city. Number two, Nathan Adams, right the bank VP. I want them both hit by next week. So put your best men on it and let me know when it's done, right. (dramatic music) (gunshot) - Hey! No! No! (screams) (phone rings) - Yeah? Fell off a building? What do you mean fell off a building? Accident, accident my ass! Hey, it's business. What about Adams? Well get someone else to take care of him then. And after that, see if you can hit Ho Lung and this time without screwing up. Hey, get your ass back in bed! (dramatic music) (explosion) (phone rings) Yeah? Blown up? Blown up, what do you mean blown up? - If this continues and the boys back east get word of it, I'm outta business or worse-- - Hell I should've known you couldn't handle this. Who's doing it? - Well how am I supposed to know God damn it? - What do you mean you don't know? - Look, whoever is hitting my boys has probably got my line tapped, you know what I mean? Yeah, well I'm calling from a phone booth now. - Well you better find out who is doing it and take care of it. - Well how am I supposed to take care of it? I don't know what's going on. Now look Mr. G., I've got to have some more time and some help too. They're trying to take this town and shove it up my ass. Hey, hey, what are you doing? (screams) - George, George, what's going on? God damn it can you hear me George? Hello, hello? Are you there? George, hello, hello, hello? (phone rings) Yeah, yeah? - Mr. Gioretti? - Who is this? - I'm the one who's been killing your men. - Who is this damn it? - All contract killings in this city are under my control. If you want someone killed, I'm afraid you'll have to deal with me. - Deal with you, look I don't have to deal with anyone. - If you want someone killed in this city, you must deal with us in person and we will discuss the fee. (dramatic music) - Mr. Gioretti? - Yeah Mike what is it? - Don't you want me to go in there with you? - What for, I can handle this alone. Go eat dinner at Tony's, I'll call you there when I need you. - But you shouldn't go in there without protection. I mean why take chances with those people? - Look, I only hired you because of your father, so don't start telling me what to do. Don't say shit to me, just drive the car and do what I say. Do you understand? - Yes sir. - And you better be there when I call and not out screwing around like you did last time. Do you hear? - Yes sir. (tires screeching) - Mr. Gioretti, come in. Please, wait here. - So good of you to come Mr. Gioretti. - Oh don't mention it. -Are you ready to avail yourself of my services? - Let's just say I don't intend losing anymore of my men. - Please accept my expression of sympathy for the death of your employees. - They were good men, highly professional. - I think you will find my organization also highly professional. - Well before I tell you who I want hit, before I spend any of my money, I'd like to see just how professional you really are. - I shall gladly give you a demonstration, after dinner. (accordion music) - Here you are Mike. I don't care what anybody says, you don't get spaghetti this good nowhere back east. I told the boys to fix it up extra special for a good friend. - You're the best Tony. - Hey that's right, wait til you taste the sauce. It's special too, it's my own recipe. Lots of people they ask me for the recipe but I tell them nothing doing. Hey Mike, why should I tell them huh? So they can open up their own restaurant? Or maybe they eat at home? No, you want to taste food like this, you gotta come see Tony. Now you need anything Mike, you just call me. - All right Tony thank you, it looks great. - Hey, tastes good too, go on try. There you see what I say. Okay I'll let you eat now. - Hey Tony, come here. - It's good, no? - No what do you call this, a joke? - It's no joke, you find it in the spaghetti? I fire the one who did this even it's my own brother. (dramatic music) (screams) (loud crash) (gunfire) (gunshot) (gunshot) (trigger clicks) - [Madame Lee] Is the meal for your liking Mr. Gioretti? - It's all right, but let's get down to business. - Without the demonstration you asked for? - Yeah, yeah, later. If we can come to a business agreement, I want these two men hit. - Oh yes, Mr. Lung. He uses his karate studio as a front for narcotics traffic. - You're well informed. The other man, Nathan Adams. He keeps forgetting he's supposed to be working for me. - Kill him and he's replaced by another one of your men at the bank. - I just want him out. Now, what about that demonstration? {dramatic oriental music) (gunshot) - The wine was not to your liking Mr. Gioretti? - You took my driver, I took your waiter. Just to make things even. - Of course Mr. Gioretti, we must keep things even. Now, shall we do business? - All right. - You serve tonight. {knocks on door) - See that this man receives one of our red Buddhas. I believe you can find him at his karate school tonight. Oh and uh please don't leave any witnesses. (grunting) - Does this Buddha belong to anyone? It was left outside of my office. Perhaps I'll keep it then. (glass shatters) (yelling and screaming) (screaming) (screams) (electricity sparks) (police sirens) - Hey wait a minute, I know him, what happened? - Got his hand cut off, he's in shock. - Jesus - Can he make it? - Not if you don't quit talking to him. - You all right? - Lieutenant these are two of the callers. - I'll talk to them later. (dramatic music) - [Mike] Clay. - Thank you Mike. God I hate coming back here. - It beats being on the streets. - You'll change your mind in a couple weeks. - Eh, well if it isn't Lieutenant Forrester. Glad to see you could join us. - Don't start on me, we've been out on this case since 3:.00 AM this morning. - All right, tell me where's this Frank Thomas. What room are they keeping him in? - Why do you wanna know? It's our case. - Well you guys have been ticketed for that human relations lapse. That's what the captain said. - We'll handle that, you stay out of our case. - Okay it's your funeral. - He's right, here's a memo from the captain. - Oh screw that human relations crap. - You were supposed to show up today for a makeup today and I'm supposed to go with you. (phone rings) - Forrester, homicide. Fine, we'll be right out. - Hospital? - Frank is conscious, we can talk to him. - Hey, what about this? - What do you wanna be, a detective or a paper pusher? Let's go. - Don't you think we better check out that human relations class? - Don't worry about it Jerry. Lieutenant Forrester, Frank Thomas' room. - Room 376 down the hall. - Thank you. - I hate hospitals. - You better get used to them, we spend a lot of time in hospitals questioning people. - I don't think I'll ever get used to it. - Hi Lieutenant. - Were there any visitors? - Nobody just the hospital staff. - Keep your eyes open. - Right, - Frank? Frank? - I'm awake. - Clay Forrester, my partner Jerry Farnham. - What are you guys doing here, questions? - You up to it? - [Frank] Sure. - Frank have you ever seen this before? - Mr. Lung, our instructor, found it somewhere. I don't know where. - I've only got one question, could you identify them if you saw them again? - I'll never forget their faces. If you don't find them Forrester, I will. - You leave the police work to me. - Who's talking about police work? If I find them first, I'll send them to you in pieces. - You're not going anywhere for a while. I'll stop In later with a sketch artist to draw up those faces before you forget them. - Lieutenant, I won't be forgetting them. - Good, we'll be seeing you. - Take care of yourself Frank. - Fun job I bet. - Nurses are the only thing keeping me awake. - Well at least you're inside. - Yeah, see ya. - Oh Lieutenant, about those security rules, can the patient receive gifts? - Like what? - Well this package was left for him downstairs. There was no card on it, just his name on the box. - Well let's have a look at it. (eerie dramatic music) {knocks on door) - Thought I was clear when I told you to leave no witnesses. I just delivered a Buddha to the hospital. The witness is on the 3rd floor. I suggest you finish the job tonight before he tells the police too much. (door slams) - I'm sorry I didn't mean to wake you. - Oh if it isn't Florence Nightingale again. You come to see if my tubes are all in place? - At least the insults are getting a little tamer. You should've heard yourself when you were under sedation. - Say when are they gonna take this junk off anyway? - That's up to Dr. Putnam, maybe in a week. - Well, I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna let Putnam put a God damn hook on me. - Well that may not even be necessary. They have cosmetic hands now. - Oh, that's a great choice isn't it. A useless decoration or something that turns me into a freak show. - Look, I know how tough it is being in a hospital and not having a family. - Well, I've been on my own for a long time now and everything is just okay. - Everyone needs friends, we all do. - The only thing I need right now is my right hand. Say what are you, a nurse or a psychiatrist? - Just call me Florence. (light piano music}) (screams) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) (screams) (eerie dramatic music) - Mistress Lee, I'm afraid I have some upsetting news for you. - What is it? - It seems that one of our men was either killed or captured at the hospital tonight. - And the witness? - [Mr. Lu] They say he is dead. - How was our man captured? - They really don't know, there were shots, they barely escaped. They thought he was behind them when they fled. - Fled! (slap) - It's an old trick. - Yeah but you're idea worked Clay. - It's the next time I'm worried about. - Especially with those armored vests. - Armored vests, man these guys are heavy. - Had to aim at his head to bring him down. - Joe you come upstairs and you can stick by Frank's new room with the other officer until we move Frank out. - All right. - Jerry check hospital security to see how they got in. - Right, - I'll see you downstairs in - Okay. (eerie music) - What are you doing here? You know you are forbidden to enter this room. - Oh excuse me. - It's all right Lieutenant, come on in. - How's it going Frank? - I guess I should be thanking you. - What for? - For saving my belly from seven inches of steel. - Okay, look, there's no reason playing games with you. I think they're gonna try again, that's why I'm having you moved. - Moved, where? - To a small private hospital in Santa Mira. You'll go in under an assumed name and we'll issue a statement to the press that our only witness can't be any help to us. - Do you think that will stop these guys from trying it again? - Who's ever behind this is gonna have enough to worry about once we question our suspect. How are you doing otherwise? - Oh fine, it's a great life. I just move my little finger and they come running. - Okay, get some sleep, you'll be moving in a couple hours. Look I stopped by to talk to Ned yesterday. He wants you to come back to work for the bar once you get on your feet again. You interested? - Sure, why not? A one handed bartender should be a great draw. Every bar should have at least one. - Well, if it isn't the dynamic duo, Lieutenant Forrester and Mr. Farnham. - Doyle I'll give you one second to get your ass out of my chair before I toss you and the chair right out the window. - What's the matter Lieutenant, crying the paperwork blues again? - Doyle get your ass outta here we got work to do. - Hey I'm just killing time until my suspect comes down for questioning. You know the guy they booked for attempted murder at the hospital? - What are you talking about? - Hey here comes our baby now. - He's our baby. - Oh no, not anymore. The captain's turned that questioning over to me. Seems you two have been delinquent at the human relations course. - God damn it. - What's your bitch Forrester? - Bringing that jackass on our case. - Rating reports for the entire squad. Whole squad rates high, and now we come to Lieutenant Forrester. - Jesus Christ. - Reports and paperwork, late and incomplete. Press relations, smashed a TV camera deliberately. - No that was— - Volunteer work, none, favorable communications, two lousy letters, and last, but not least, attendance and performance at departmental training classes, you rank last in the entire squad. - What about number of arrests? Number of convictions, sir? - Listen Forrester, this damn stuff is just as important as the street work. That's what the commissioner looks at, like it or not. - Sir we realize we missed our makeup class but our key witness in the karate school murders-- - Karate school murders, karate, oh yeah, now I remember, I read about them in the newspaper somewhere. Because I still don't have your report! - Hell, we were out til 3:00 in the morning-- - I don't give a damn how late you were out. You should've taken the time to at least jot down a lousy paragraph or two, so when the chief comes and questions me about it, I can halfway tell him something other than what I read in the newspaper. Forrester, you get your butt down to that human relations makeup session in half an hour. I put Doyle and Rossi on the case and you will fill them in, and you will cooperate with them. Is that clear Lieutenant? - Yes it's clear. - Now, I want a full report on your case, your former case, by quitting time this afternoon. Is that clear Lieutenant? - Yes, clear, right. - Oh, and if you don't like my style Forrester, you've got two choices, turn in a transfer request, or turn in our badge, I'll take either one. Otherwise get on with the program. - Well Forrester, we'll let you know how the case comes out. I hope you enjoy your class. Of course I've already taken my class. Can't you tell by the way my personality has improved? - You want a briefing on the case? - No [ think I have all I need right now besides I don't think your partner here is feeling any too cooperative today. All right we got it, go. - What good is this, he'll never talk. - He can listen, he can nod yes or no. - The recorder won't pick up the nods. - Well then Rossi one of us is going to have to say "suspect gestures yes" or "suspect gestures no". Are you all set? - Gonna uncuff him? - [Doyle] Do what? - [Rossi] Well that's procedure, kinda rough-- - Are you crazy, you saw what those victims he hauled outta the karate school. - All right, want me to start the recorder? - Not yet, wait a minute. I want this off the record. Now I'm gonna put this to you straight buddy, now we've got you nailed for those murders at the karate school, and that attempted murder at the hospital, so now if you cooperate with us things will go a hell of a lot easier for you. All right, read him his rights. - They did that already when they booked him. - I want it on tape Rossi. - All right. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements. You understand? There's something wrong with him. I think he's sick, I'm going to uncuff him. - Hey you want a glass of water? (screams) (upbeat dramatic music) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunfire) (gunshots) (tires screech) (loud crash) - (police radio) All units stolen police vehicle 331 suspect driving, dangerous, may be armed, caucasian in black under shirt. - Go ahead and eat son. Ma cooked it for you, no charge. You look like you've got trouble. Just remember, no matter what happens, put your trust in God and he'll guide you to the right path. I know it's hard to believe, especially when things are tough, but God looks out for all of us, whether you believe or not. Now, I've got some pamphlets here that you can have. And I want you to read them, they'll help you to find God. And if ever need anyone to talk to, you can always come and see Ma and me. And if we're not open, we live in the back. And you can come look us up at any time, any time. (laughter) (shouting and chattering) - Let me have a beer. - Yeah a lot of beers and a cheeseburger. - What a dump this place is man. I don't wanna eat here. - Shut up asshole, we're eating here. Hey, where's my beer, what is this? Don't mess with my hair man, don't do that. See that, huh? Weapon, that's my weapon. Oh, oh. - Hey good looking what are you doing today? Seems like you could go for a little putt. Leave this dipshit your with and we'll go for a little ride, how about that? - That wind would mess up her hair. - Oh it's okay, I'll take care of her hair. - Hey you just sit down and be social. - [Waiter] Come on boys, leave my customers alone. - You just serve the beer old man. - Oh John leave the broad alone will ya. Beer here, hey, who's the Tarzan guy? Hey, Tarzan? Are you running from the law man? (whistles) Hey this guy is running from the law. - Hey Tony I smell pig man, I think that dude is probably an undercover cop. - Yeah, look at his haircut, he's gotta be a pig man. - I don't know man, undercover cops man they got long hair and that dude's got short hair. - Oh eat it turkey, that guy is a pig, can't you smell it? Ugh, bad. (laughs) - Hey are you a cop? Are you a cop? Hey I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you, Tarzan. I'm talking to you, shit this guy is a cop. This guy is weird. Hey don't you hear me talking to you? Don't you hear me talking to you? Talking to you Tarzan. Hey Tarzan, he's sitting there eating his cheeseburger. Tarzan, look at the muscles on that guy man. He's got long hair and everything. Guy's gotta be running from the law, look at that outfit. Hey, hey, you, I'm talking to you, Tarzan. Listen, look at this guy. Look at this, man the guy's got the muscles. I got muscles, mine are all on the inside though. (laughs) Hey, this guy's got blood on him. Hey what's the matter with you man? Hey what, hey what do we got here? Hey man you are running from the law.

Mr. Gioretti has suggested we try to persuade Nathan Adams to relinquish his position without resorting to violence. - You wish me to have a talk with him? - Yes, but before you do I think we need some leverage. - Leverage? - He has a daughter. - Well I'm fine daddy, I'm only 40 miles away. It's not like I'm on the other side of the world. Okay. Okay, hey look, if I don't finish my homework I'll flunk out this semester. Can't you see the headlines, bank president's daughter fails first semester of college, shamed father jumps out window. No I don't have any boys in the apartment. With all the time I'm on the phone I haven't had a chance to meet any. Okay, I love you too. Bye. (screams) (phone buzzes) - Yes Kay? - There's a Mr. Lu to see you, all right. Mr. Adams will see you now. - [Mr. Lu] Thank you. - Mr. Lu, please have a seat. - Thank you. - I'm sorry but I must apologize, my secretary didn't tell me the nature of your business here. - I believe it was an ancestor of mine who once said a picture speaks 1000 words. The others in the photograph don't matter but you do recognize your daughter. We do not want money, everything will work out and no harm will come to anyone. - Harm to no one, putting my daughter through this? - She was not totally conscious at the time. - Get out of here, this cheap shakedown won't work. - You know of course that your financial colleagues will receive a set of these pictures? - I can explain it to them. - And will an explanation be sufficient? In your daughter's case, it might be a traumatic experience, a shame that might haunt her for the rest of her life. Even though your daughter may be as sexually sophisticated as other students today, I'm quite sure their sexual habits do not include this. Our clients wish you to resign your position and recommend this man. - What? - Sever your connections with this bank. You may then relocate to a different city and resume your career. That will fulfill your obligation, you will not be asked to do anything further. - Gioretti's behind this, isn't he? - That I'm sorry, I cannot say. Merely, deliver your letter of resignation by noon today. - I'd be a fool to walk away from a job that's taken me my whole life to work up to. Just 50 a stooge can get into the bank, no. - In that case Mr. Adams, please, move over to the filing cabinet. Move, I was hoping I did not have to resort to violence. (yells) Goodbye Mr. Adams. - Kay help me! Get in here I'm chained to the filing cabinet and there's a bomb in here! - The door is locked. - Get the key! Kay! The door is locked. - Mr. Adams you have the key in your desk. - Get help! Kay, get some help please! (screams) Help me! Somebody! (explosion) (eerie music) (screams) (glass crashing) (soft piano music) - Hello Frank. - How did you know I was here? - Ned at the bar told me. - It's my lunch hour. - He said you used to use your lunch hours to study. - Well I quit school. - Why, I thought you had dreams of becoming an architect? - Yeah. - Did you get the cards I sent down to the Santa Mira hospital? I tried to come down to see how you were doing but my schedule has been pretty rough lately. Nights, mostly. I have a few days off now. - Thanks for coming over, I'll see you out. - Don't worry, I found my way in by myself. - Look, I'm sorry. - I'm the one who's sorry for getting involved. - You don't know how it is for me. - I know how it is Frank. - No one asked you to go and-- - Get involved? Sure, no one did. Look, I won't be bothering you anymore. Goodbye Frank. Aren't you even going to call me back? - Wasn't thinking about it. - I can see it's going to take some time getting used to you. - Why would you even want to try? - I don't know, maybe by the time I get used to you, you'll be used to yourself. - Would you like to come over to the bar for some coffee? Maybe the waiter isn't too friendly but the coffee's pretty good. - Is it a nice bar? (piano music) - I need a beer. - That will be a dollar. - A buck for one beer? - Entertainment goes with it. - Entertainment, you call that entertainment? Shit, I've seen better entertainment in the zoo. - Hey living in a monkey house, I bet you have. - Sorry to leave you alone, I had to get those cases moved. - That's all right, I was just watching the entertainment. - Oh, yeah, Ned just hired her last week. He thought it would help business, only it hasn't. - Do you like working here? - The hours are flexible enough which helped when I was in college. The pay is fair. - What are your plans now that you've quit school? - I don't know, I just don't know vet, I need time to think. (applause) - Frank you got any change for the jukebox? - Not now Sharon. - All right Frank. - Does she always ask you for change? - Oh that's just her way of getting tips. - [Ned] Frank will get me another case of beer from the back? - Yeah sure Ned. - So that was you who called on the phone. Well I see you found him all right. - Oh yeah, he was down at the karate school just like you said. - I don't know what's gotten into him. He's been there everyday this week. - He's just trying to find himself. - It was a terrible thing that happened to him but he shouldn't be wasting his time in a closed down karate school. - He'll be all right. - And don't you give up on him, no matter how nasty he gets. If you can't bring him around, nobody can. - Maybe your dancer can. - Oh I wouldn't worry about her. - [Patron] Hey give me a beer. - All right, all right. - Hey this jukebox doesn't work. - All right, all right, just hit it easy. (loud banging) Hey. - Come on now. - Knock it off, knock it off. - [Patron] It still doesn't work. - All right, all right, I'll give you your money back. Let it alone. - I want the buck for the beer back too, it stinks. - Why don't you shut the hell up? (screams) - Hey knock it off. (groans) (screams) (glass shatters) (glass shatters) (glass shatters) (glass shatters) (soft piano music) - Frank. - What? - What now? - I don't know. - Where do we go from here? - Well I guess I go back to the bar and you go back- - Back to the hospital. - I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way. Maybe we should both go back to the hospital and start all over again. - I wish we could go back in time. - I'd like to go back a lot farther than that. To when those three guys came crashing through that window. If only I had gotten one of them. - Trade a life for a hand? - Yes, I'd feel a lot better about this now. - Look, you should get away from here for a while. Get away from this apartment, away from the karate studio, away from the bar, from everything. Just for a little while. - You said you had a few days off from the hospital. - Three days. - Well maybe we could drive out to the ocean for a couple days. I've got enough money for food, gas, a movie or two, and a motel. - Is it a nice motel? (soft romantic music) - Our employer Mr. Gioretti is arriving at his airfield in one hour. He is bringing the balance of the money. - Shall we give him the usual receipt? - Of course, he's not powerful enough to change our method of doing business. - I'll take care of him myself. - You had better take help. Mr. Gioretti may have the same idea about us. (eerie dramatic music) - It shall be done. (upbeat music) - It's them! - What? - It's them! - Who? - The guys who cut off my hand. Get the license plate number. - 605 CWJ, 605 CWJ. (tires screech) - Get out and call the police department! Homicide, ask for Lieutenant Forrester. Tell him what's happening. - What are you going to do? - Just get out before I lose them. - You can't go after them. - I'm just gonna follow them, get out. - But Frank. - Get out! (phone rings) - Forrester, homicide. Oh yes what can I do for you? - We just found the three men who killed the people in the karate studio. - You found them? No, just calm down. Did you get the license number? Where are you now? Stay there I'll put a tracer on the license number. - Frank's following them now, I don't know what he's going to do. - Just stay there. Put a tracer out on this, meet me in a car, and tell them to radio the information. - Forrester, where the hell are you going? I want that report. - Look, the three suspects in the karate school murders have just been sighted. I have a chance to pick up all three of them, including the one that Doyle let escape and tear up the department. So to hell with the report, to hell with the paperwork, and screw you. - Forrester. Forrester. (dramatic music) (explosion) (light oriental music) - Mr. Gioretti has been taken care of. - I think it is time to take care of those three. - Gladly. (gunshots) (eerie music) (crows cawing) (crows cawing) (dramatic music) (screams) (gunshot) - You all right? - Frank? - It's okay. (eerie music) - Hello. Flight 983 leaves at gate 4 in half an hour. Enjoy your flight. (dramatic music)
