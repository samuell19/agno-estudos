♪ ♪ ♪ (crash) - You okay? Shit. (panting) You okay, man? - Dude! That was awesome! (howls) What took you so long? - How's your leg? - It's better now. - What is this place? - I don't know, man. It's like an old mine shaft or something. - No. Not way out in the middle, holy shit! - That thing is awesome. What is that? It's like a real dead guy. - What the hell is this place? - Oh my. Look at the tits on that one. - No seriously, what is this place? - It's pretty spooky, man. Woah, man. Get your light over here. Check this out. Let's see if we can move this thing. - Hey, hey, hey. I wouldn't be moving that door if I were you. - You're such a pussy sometimes. Come on, man. Help me out. - Hey, watch out! (rumbling) (screams) (screams) (suspenseful exotic music) (rock music) - [Sam] The victim died of massive internal trauma. How do you even know this site is safe? - [Swartek] Because it's my job to know how to secure an archaeological find, okay? Now, if I need to ever conduct an autopsy, I'll be sure to give you a call. - I'm the coroner in this! You see what I'm dealing with here? - Sam. Sam, it's alright. Now look, the last thing any of us wants is another accident. I just think you should consider stopping the work here until we can be assured that your kids will be safe. - Sheriff, this is a sensitive historical discovery. Okay, I will not allow untrained personnel to disturb any of the artifacts. - Where do you get the authority?! - The governor's office, National Park Service, Secretary of the Interior, take your pick. Need I remind either one of you that we're discussing federal land here? - No sir, you don't need to remind me. This ain't my first rodeo. But let's be clear about something. Federal jurisdiction or not. If I decide that this site is a danger to the public, including you and your students, I'm shutting you down. - Got it. Understand. - Good. Come on, Sam. Take care of yourself, miss. Be careful. - Molly. - Professor Swartek. - Hey. - What was that all about? - Oh, nothing. You know, just the usual. Dealing with the bureaucracy. So'd you have any trouble finding the place? - No. No, not really. Signs would've been nice, but. - Yeah. Right. Well, we don't actually want anyone else to find this place. So. - Why? What's going on? - Well, I'm gonna show you. - Why all the secrecy? - You'll see. - Oh my. Is that? - Come on. Careful going down though. This first step, a little difficult. (light apprehensive music) - This can't be. - Pretty great, huh? - [Dr. Ben-David] Be careful. All of you. There may be more traps. - Is that who I think it is? - Mm-hmm. - Axel, help me with the door. - Look out! - Carter. It is safe. Just, Axel, get some lights in there. Do not touch anything. Once we get some lights, we begin work. - Professor. Professor, I'd like to introduce you to someone, Mrs. Molly Kirnan. Remember, the grad student I told you about? Molly, this is, - Professor Ari Ben-David of Cairo University. I am a great admirer of your epigraphy of the sacara in Necropolis. - Kara, we need the CCS let out by the end of the day. - [Kara] Not a problem. - Molly is a historical linguistics specialist. Her work in pre-dynastic phonograms is pretty remarkable, actually. - Ah, so what do you think of our little discovery. - It can't be real. - Preliminary electrocarbon analysis dates this site at 2654 BCE. - What is a Third Dynasty burial chamber doing in southern California? - Well, 10 years ago, Balabanova discovered arithrozylin coca and nicotiana tobacum in the hair shafts of ancient Egyptian mummies. - Yeah, nicotine, cocaine. - Plants that only existed in the western hemisphere during the age of the pharaohs. - And Professor Ben-David's long theory is that the Egyptians must have formed some kind of trans-Atlantic trade route. - And now I believe my theories have been proven fact. There are far too many similarities between Egyptian and Inca step pyramids for it just to be mere coincidence. - [Axel] Ready doctor. - Ah. Please, come. Everybody. Come. (light intriguing music) When I discovered the Mustavas at Tamadosan Sacara, I discovered an execration text that described a young priestess banished from Egypt because she claimed to be a living god. The name of that priestess is the same as the one that is in here, Aneh-Tet. Aneh-Tet was a priestess of Zet, the god of chaos and evil. Zet members believed they would be given the great power to cast spells, to raise the dead, and to be given eternal life. But Aneh-Tet's powers threatened Josier, the ruling pharaoh at the time, and so he had her banished across the great water. Egyptologists assumed this meant the Red Sea. It appears the truth written on these walls. It is a mystery that will take much to unravel. I see symbols predate heiroglyphs that we know by 2,000 years. So, let's have a look at her, shall we? (suspenseful drum music) - How did she die? - The Egyptians believed that when they passed to the underworld, they would become powerful and mighty, and Aneh-Tet had herself mummified, so that when she is resurrected, she will return as a living god. - What happens then? - It says here, that the ka or the spirit of Aneh-Tet shall return to her rightful place as the pharaoh of Egypt. - Excuse me, but I, I think that this actually says that she who's name brings terror, shall rise up from the underworld, and bring forth those who will destroy her enemies, and take her place as supreme ruler of both the living and the dead. - Yes. Well, what say we all take a quick lunch. We have much work to do. It is Molly, right? It is very important that nobody know about this site until we have finished our work. Do you understand? - Yeah, of course. - If this turns out to be what I think it is, it will be the discovery of a lifetime. - I understand. - Your skills will be very useful here. - I'll do what I can. - I don't care (unrecognizable) Imratep, not Imsatep. - That's totally right. - No it's not. You read it totally wrong, 'cause I was right there next to you. - Come on, baby. (light intriguing music) (reading wall) (intense music) - Oh shit. Bryan. - Good, Molly. Now we can talk about el-Amarna. - There's nothing to talk about. - How could you say that? I mean, we were just, - Professor Edwards. - What is it, Carter? - How do I get back to the motel? - What happened to Santos? - I heard he left. Everybody's gone. - Ah, shit. Carter, you can take Molly, okay? - Well no. I don't wanna, I wanna. - It's fine. You have to check in anyway, and Carter knows how to get there. Problem solved. It's fine. - Okay. (light rock music with singing) Is this the right way? Is this how it's gonna be between us? - What did you expect? - I thought we could be friends. Carter, we weren't even dating. - You know how I felt about you. And I thought you felt the same way. - I did. - Then why? - It was a mistake. His wife had just left him. He reached out to me. I was drunk. Haven't you ever slept with somebody and then regretted it? - Hope you got a good grade at least. - Fuck you Carter. Home. (light jazzy rocky music) (phone ringing) - Yo. - [Molly] Hey Kev, it's me. Is mom there? - No. She's working a double. Where are you? - I'm headed to a hotel. - Are you with a guy? - I'm on a dig. - [Kevyn] Yawn. - Listen, I didn't think it was gonna be anything, so I didn't bring any clothes, and I was gonna ask mom to bring a bag tomorrow, but if she's - I'll do it. - [Molly] What about school? - Do you want your clothes or not? - [Molly] Yeah. Yeah, okay. Alright. - Cool. Where am I going? - Is that... - Alright, got a pen and paper? Okay, it's the Tropic Motel. It's at 49001 Route 72. - I'll see you at noon. - [Molly] I wanna be on site at six. - Dream on. - [Molly] Okay, eight. - Cool. I'll see you at 10. (foreboding music) (crickets) (apprehensive music) (reading wall) (thunder) (strange deep whispering voices) (intense apprehensive music) - What are you doing here? Who are you? - I'm one of Professor Swartek's students. I was just, I was making a translation. - Not now, you aren't. No one is supposed to be in the tomb unsupervised. - But, they didn't. - Don't you know there was a death here five days ago? - No, I didn't. - I think we need to talk to the professor. - No, that's not necessary. I'll just go back to the hotel. - You don't wanna see Professor Swartek? I thought you were his student. - It's complicated. - Come on. - Molly. - [Dennis] I found her in the tomb, professor. She said she was a student of yours. - She is. It's fine, Dennis. - [Dennis] You said that no one goes in the tomb without yours or Dr. Ben-David's permission. - And that's right. That's right. That's fine, but I'll take care of it. Thank you. Thanks. Well, this is good. Now we can finish our conversation. Bryan, don't. - What's the matter? You didn't have a problem with it last summer? - Last summer was a mistake. - Oh, I see. - No, that's not what I mean. I was drunk. - So that means you don't have to take responsibility for what happened? Is that what you're saying? - No, that's not what I'm saying. Please don't be this way. Listen, Bryan. I respect you so much, and you've done so much for me, but I just want our relationship to stay professional. That's all. - Fine. - I really want us to be friends. - Good night Molly. - I'm gonna be a little late tomorrow. My sister's bringing me some clothes. - Look, obviously you're gonna do what you wanna do. Okay? So just do it. Just try and get back here when you can. Aneh-Tet's not going anywhere. - Kara. Hey, it's Bryan Swartek. How are you? Good, good. I was just wondering if maybe you could come up to the site tonight and help me finish the typology for the artifacts. Why not? (apprehensive wind sound) (thunder) (sparks) (thunder) (apprehensive music) (intense rumblings and wind sound) - Who's there? You're naked. (groaning) (string music) - Kara, is that you? (screaming) (intense wind) - I'll go wake Professor Swartek. - Oh, is that what you call it? - Not cool, man. Not cool. - I mean... - Professor? (screaming) - Where is my mummy?! - Piece of shit. - Kevyn. - You so owe me. (apprehensive music) - Oh, I really appreciate you doing this Kev. - You could buy me some beer. - I'm kidding. - What's the wait? I gotta get going. - [Motel manager] Hey, you! Get out of there! - What's that? - I don't know. - Come here. Come here. - Is everything okay? - Is she one of yours? Well get some clothes on her. This is a family business. - Okay, okay. Here. Come with us, okay? - [Molly] I'll get some more towels. - Okay. My name's Kevyn. Yeah, I know, I've already heard all the jokes. Kevyn. My name's Kevyn. - Aneh-Tet. - Annette? Your name's Annette? Let's cover you up. Here. What are you doing? - How we doing? - Well, I found out that her name is Annette. And she's gay. - Annette? (speaking French) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Hebrew) (speaking unknown language) - What was that? Did you understand that? (speaking unknown language) - What did she say?! - It's impossible. - What? - She's speaking a language that's been dead for 3,000 years. You guys stay here. I'm gonna go find Professor Swartek, okay? - I'm calling Mom and telling her I'm staying with you for the weekend. Stay here, okay? - Yeah, we won't be able to properly identify the bodies until we get some DNA testing. - My god. - She's not one of yours? - No. - Excuse me, miss. Miss. Miss, just stop right there. Who are you? Did you hear me? I asked you a question. You don't wanna listen, do you? (rumblings, wind, unrecognizable voices) - What's wrong? - Professor Swartek is dead. - Oh my god, no way. - I just saw him last night. - It was bad. - What are you talking about? What happened? - I've gotta go find out. Stay here. - Wow. - I told you to wait outside. - Please. - Dr. Ben-David? Annette? - Molly. - What's going on? - I see that you have met my assistant from Cairo. - Your assistant? - Yes. I believe she can be very helpful with the translations. Why? What were you thinking? That Aneh-Tet, High Priestess of Setekh, had risen from the dead? (laughs) - No, of course not. It's not possible. - No, it isn't, is it? - North wall. Grids seven, eight, and nine depict the life symbol ankh, surrounded by six warrior figures, and six upside down figures, unattested in any known translations. The six warriors probably represent the six mummies found in the tomb, but I don't understand the other figures. They could be representations of something they'll become. Something more powerful. (playing and laughing) (rap music) (laughs) - You're drinking this time. - I told you, I don't drink. - Oh, shut up. Do it again. - Oh! - Don't mess with the reflex. - Drink dude! - Kevyn! - Molly. - What are you doing? - Do you know what this guy can do? Show my sister what you can do. - I don't think she'll be impressed. - Hey, come back here! - Hey, you know what? I think you've had enough? - Your sister was cool, Molly. - She's 17. Give me that. - Head rush. - Alright, come on. Let's get you to the room. - Hey Axe, we're going to bed too man. - You okay? - Oh yeah, as long as the bill holds out, I'm all, "Y'all have fun!" - We will, we will. - Go have fun. - Howdy. You Dr. Ben-David? - Yes. - I'm J.L. Jones. I'm the county sheriff around here. You wouldn't happen to know where my deputy is? - No, he left us hours ago. Why? - He hasn't checked in. I found his car abandoned at the county line 20 miles from here. - I'm sorry to hear that. - He didn't happen to say where he was going, did he? - No sheriff. I'm sorry. - It's okay, I'm just trying to retrace his steps. You'll call if you or your students hear anything. - Of course. - Oh. That original call. Something to do with a missing person, or a stolen mummy or something, right? - Yes. But everything is all right now. We have found her. - Good, good. Good evening. - Finish that water, Kev. - That Carter guy is in love with you. - I know. - What's wrong? He's cute. You both like boring stuff. You're perfect for each other. - It's not gonna happen. - Why not? - Because I did something that really hurt him. - So. It's not like either one of you is dead. If you care about him, like do something about it. - And everyone says I'm the smart one. (laughs) - Jones. - [Sam] Sheriff, Sam. - What do you have for me? - Both victims died of massive dehydration. - Look, I admit I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I know those two guys didn't die of thirst. - [Sam] Talking about 80% water loss in less than what I count at one minute. - What could cause that? - I have no idea, but you haven't heard the best part yet. I found foreign skin and hair samples on both bodies. - [Sheriff] So, we have a suspect? - No, no, no. Not there yet. Cannot figure a way a human being could have done this. I've extracted DNA, analyzing it now. - Well, I need answers, Sam. - I'm doing what I can, Jim. But this is two deaths now. Isn't that enough to shut 'em down? - I've been calling the governor's office all day, but this character Ben-David seems to have some juice. I need more. - [Sam] I'll call you when I have something. - Let's hope that's just soon enough. - Oh man. I'm gonna get me something. Hey, wait for me! Yes. Thank you. Hey, where'd you go?! Shit, you scared me. Stop. Shit. You like it rough. That's cool. Oh, hey baby. Let's take it slow. Take it, yeah. (drums) - Ah, Molly. Good, you are here. You can help me with these translations. - No, I need to talk to you. - About what? - Something isn't right. These heiroglyphics are unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. - That is because they are older texts than anything we are familiar with. - But, it's more than that. They're darker, more, I don't know, aggressive. See. A priestess from the West shall speak the coming forth into day and shall awaken the Hemet Netsher. She who is all-powerful. Ankh is never depicted like this. It's the life symbol, but here it seems to me, more like a weapon. Most Egyptian funerary texts are about rebirth and democratization of the afterlife. These all seem to be about conquest and destruction. She will bring death and pain, destruction and fear. World domination. - Does it say how this will happen? - Well, I think, I think that's over here. - Get out of here Molly. - What did she say? Something about a priestess, I couldn't quite understand. - I told you not to tell anyone about this site. I do not want you back here. - But I need to know. - I said get out! (apprehensive music) - Carter, I need to talk to you. - I'm a little busy right now. - This isn't about us. I need your help. It's about Annette. - Ben-David's assistant. - She's not his assistant. She doesn't speak Hebrew or Arabic. - What do you think she, come on. - The mummy of Aneh-Tet disappears and some girl shows up speaking Old Kingdom Egyptian. Nothing else makes sense. She's planning something. I don't know what, but the answer is in those heiroglyphics. I can translate the text, but I can't interpret the religious significance. I need you. - I can't help you. - Carter. I don't know how many times I could apologize for what I did to you. - How about once? - Housekeeping. - Come back later! (screams) (birds chirping) (apprehensive music) (thunder) - What the fuck? Oh my god! (screaming) - Need a break, babe? - I'm gonna run back to the motel, check on Axe, make sure he didn't pass out, drown in his own vomit or something. - Nice. - See you later? - Hell yeah. - Bye. - Bye. (suspenseful music) (banging) - Professor? Professor? - Kara, I. - I don't understand. - You should not have come in here Kara. - Professor. I (screaming) - No! No! No! - I'm sorry Kara. (screaming) (screams) - Shit Molly! - Are you okay? - You scared the shit out of me! - God, I'm sorry. Here, I brought you ice cream. - All is forgiven. - So, how do you feel? - I'm never drinking again. - Good. Kev, I need you to do me a favor. - What? - I want you to go home. - Why? - It's too complicated to explain. - It's mummy chick isn't it? - What makes you say that? - I don't have to be a nerd to figure out that. Bitch is bad news. - Oh, Kev. Please. Just do me this favor, okay? - No, I can help you. - No, you cannot help me. - How do you know that? You think you've got all the answers just because you're Miss Cumma Sum Laude - Summa cum laude. - Whatever. You never think about things until after you do them. Like coming to the desert without bringing any clothes. - I'm not discussing this anymore. I want you to get dressed. I want you to get out of here, okay? - Where are you going? I wanna go with you. - Kev, please! I don't want anything to happen to you, okay? Just please go home. - I'm not going anywhere. - I'm such an asshole. What are you doing? Oh my god, stop. (screams) (suspenseful drums) (speaking ancient language) (suspenseful drums) - Carter, oh my god. Carter, what's going on? You're hurt. - Just drive. Drive! - I gotta take a shit. I need some fucking toilet paper. - Hey, you just get back? - Yeah, just like a half an hour ago. - Did Kara come with you? - Na, I haven't seen her. Maybe she came with Jill. - I already asked her. Shit. I better get out there. - What the fuck?! - I have a first aid kit in my room. - Sit down. Where's your kit? - In my bag, the dresser. - Take off your shirt. We should get you to a hospital. - We don't have time. - Why not? - Because we have to stop Aneh-Tet. - Did she say anything when she attacked you? - She said (ancient language) - Are you sure? - Positive. - Why would she say six? Oh my god! I am so stupid! Of course! In the tomb, there's a picture of six warriors and six shadow figures surrounding an ankh. - I saw it, the ankh. She has it. - Professor Swartek, Axel, somebody we don't know about, the deputy, security guard, you were supposed to be the sixth. - Sixth what? - Offering. - What's significance of six? Of course. She needs a victim's ka. - We have to stop her before she gets a sixth. (phone ringing) - What do you got for me, Sam? - I've got the preliminary DNA results. - It's Ben-David, isn't it? - I don't think so. Your suspect is female. - [Sheriff] One of the students? - Nope. These DNA samples are over 4,000 years old. Sheriff? - Never mind. Never mind. (light drum and string music) - Kara! Kara! Professor Ben-David. Your hair. - Sem priest must be pure if he wishes to serve the Hemet Niswah. - What the fuck are you talking about? (strong wind sound) (screaming) (rumbling) - Here, let me help you. Careful. I think I know how we can stop her, okay? I'll be right back. - Hey Molly. Thanks for the note. (apprehensive music) - Hey, what's going on out there? Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? - Carter! - Molly. Are you okay? - Carter! Oh my god! (screams) - Molly, you okay? - They're in your room. I'm not leaving without my sister. (screams) (deep unrecognizable voices) - [female TV actor] Un-fucking-believable, this is amazing. - [male TV actor] What is it, Jen? - [female TV actor] These are the tunnels that our dads went into. (speaking unknown language) - Kevyn, Kevyn. (intense drums with strings) Fuck! (speaking unknown language) - Carter! - You okay? - We have to get Kevyn. - We will. - We have to go to the tomb now. - No, we need to figure out how to stop her first. What does it say? - Oh god. Kevyn was right. It was right there in front of me the whole time, and I missed it. The dark ones will bring destruction and chaos on all mankind and place Aneh-Tet in her rightful place as almighty. - Does it say the becoming will take place? How to stop her? - The ankh of life when wedded with pure blood will have the power of life or death over any being, mortal or divine. What does that mean? - Oh. - What? - She has to sacrifice a virgin. (thunder) (apprehensive music) - Yeah, Sam. I need you to meet me at the Tropic Motel. (suspenseful string music) - This is it. (whimpering) (deep voices) - Leave me alone! (speaking unknown language) - Stop! (deep voices) Let her go. (deep voices) - Kevyn, get out of here. - I'm staying with you. - No, no. Get out of here please. Go. Your car is right outside. Call the police. Call anybody. Go, please. - You know I love you right? - I know, I love you too. Go! (screams) (speaking unknown language) - [Carter] The mummies, they're gone. - Kevyn! - Molly, stop. (deep voices) - Just hear me out, Sam. An ancient tomb is opened, and people start to mysteriously die. - And you think it's some sort of curse? - Maybe. Maybe this missing mummy isn't really missing. - Jim, I'm a scientist. - And I'm a cowboy, but just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly. If you have a better explanation, I'd sure as hell love to hear it. - No, I don't. But I know for a fact that mummies don't suddenly come to life and start killing people. Jesus Christ, what the hell is that? Jesus Christ, get us out of here! - Shut that window. - I'm trying! Unlock it! - The one on the right. (screaming) - Sam! (deep voices) - [Sheriff] Ugly son of a bitch! (strong wind sound) (gunshot) - You okay, honey? - Look out! (screaming) (deep voice) - Carter. No. No no no no no no no no. (crying) No (crying) - [Kevyn] Molly. (crying) - Carter is dead because of me. - That's not true. - Yes it is. I can do something about it, but I need your help. - We'll do it together. (speaking unknown language) Please please please please please please please please. - I'm sorry, Molly. (crying) - Why don't you try mouth-to-mouth? (light rock) - [Voiceover] In the western United States, a group of archaeology students have unearthed the tomb of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian priestess. - My god. - It's a sensitive historical discovery. - [Voiceover] But when students start turning up dead, (scream) - What do you have for me? - Your suspect is female. - [Voiceover] They realize their discovery has awakened an ancient evil. (hard rock music) - Get us out of here. Sam! (scream) - [Voiceover] Bruce Boxleitner from Babylon 5. Zach Galligan from Gremlins. Andy Lauer from Screamers. Legion of the Dead
