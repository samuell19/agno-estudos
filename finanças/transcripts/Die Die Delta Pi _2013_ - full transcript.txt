(DRAMATIC MUSIC) KATHERINE: You two stop that this instant! The nerve of some people. And I expected more from a varsity letterman! That's one butt ugly woman. Like, what a barf bag. She's so grody. What is she anyway, your mother? As if, she's our house mom. Gag! Whatever, now was my tongue in your mouth, or was yours in mine, babe? Just pucker up, dipstick! (INAUDIBLE) What? You are an established housemother. Yet these uneducated trashmouths continue to call you names. You were over this a long time ago! Calm down, Katherine. Calm down. Shouldn't you be inside with the lambs left to slaughter? What are you doing? Oh my God, did you hear that there was another murder on campus? For reals? Yes. And it was gruesome! The radio said they thought it was a beheading. That's scary being so close to us, don't you think? VOICEOVER: Yeah, tell me about it. Uh, hey, bimbettes? Might want to put your togas on before you put your makeup on, you ditzes. And why is that? Uh, duh! Not even! Oh even. See, I told you. Eat my shorts! You're not even wearing any. Allison, could y'all just hurry up? I need to get cleaned up. Aren't you going to the bonfire pit tonight? No, I am not going to the bonfire pit tonight. In fact, my boy toy is coming here so we can fuck while you two sluts are out at some bonfire party with some stupid doll doing some ritural that nobody even gives a fuck about. It's like the same bullshit every year, I'm sick of going to those things. And how many years have you been going? Ten. (LAUGHING) VOICEOVER: Ten. You know what? Why don't you just get out of here so I can get dressed?! I need to get ready. I said get! Out, now! Come on, God. (ELECTRONIC POP MUSIC) Radio DJ} Chill out, everyone. There are more hot jams coming your way. For those of you with Spring Break fever, the Serpent's Bar and Grill is having happy hour all night! Discounted prices for those lucky sorority girls. You know who you are. Now back to the jams. So Donna, where we headed to? I hope it's the beach. I love a good walk in the moonlight. The only time I go to the beach is in the daylight to catch some UVs. What, aren't your tatas crisp enough? Cool it down, airheads. None of that shit's happening. Yet! Sisters, first we're gonna go to a bonfire. It's a tradition at Delta Pi. A bonfire? That's so lame, Donna. Why don't you just gag us with a spoon already? How about we go somewhere like on a yacht or something cool like that? When we see all the bodacious hunks. For sure, Katey is right. A bonfire is so boring. Where are all the boys? Totally! There's always time for beach walks and yachts. Anyway, the bonefire's what starts the ceremonial burning of the house mom. We're going to kill Katherine? No, we burn an effigy dummy, dummy. She's such a spaz, I hate that malicious bitch, it should really be her we're burning. VOICEOVER: Nerd alert! Fucking aye, I hate that twerp. Ugh, she thinks she's so much better than us 'cause she's so smart. Delta Pi doesn't need nerds. How on Earth did she get accepted into this sorority anyway? Supposedly because Marissa's mother was a legacy here at Delta Pi, it automatically makes her eligible. Totally? Totally. And that status of sluts is what gives Marissa acceptance. Wicked. Hey Marissa, come here! Hi, everyone. Hi, Marissa. Hi, Marissa. VOICEOVER: So Marissa, what are you gonna do for Spring Break? Oh I don't know, maybe just go to the observatory, look at the stars. Are you coming to the ceremonial bonfire to kick off Spring Break? MARISSA: You'll really invite me? Well duh, you are Delta Pi, aren't you? Yeah, well, but I thought that... But but but, you're coming and that is final. Okay. Just let me get ready. Wait, one more thing. Yes? It's a toga party. Where do I get a toga? Katey, get me a toga. Seriously, Donna? Just gag me out the door why don't ya? What are you thinking, we don't need her to ruin our Spring Break. That's so lame! Sisters, don't worry, I have something really special planned for that cunt. (LAUGHING) I so can't wait to get out of these dorms rooms and into the Delta Pi house. This toga party's gonna rock! (SOFT POP MUSIC) RADIO DJ: Sun State Police Department has issued another warning to those celebrating Spring Break outdoors to be aware of another murder in the Sun State University vicinity. Police are urging students to take their festiveness indoors. Hey Pinktrick, toss me a cold one, huh? It's Patrick, asshole. What was that, Pinktrick?! Ow, God, my pinkie toe, ugh! That's what you get for putting your red shirt in my laundry, scumbag! You're the Chemistry major, can't you just use your Chemistry nerd magic to get it out, you used tampon?! It's already dyed, dipshit! Hey, Pinktrick. Heather. Oh yes! Make sure you put that under your pillow tonight and I'll come a-knocking. In your dreams, needle dick. Think about it? I did, ew, grody! Whoa man, there ain't no beer in there. Seriously?! Don't vag out on me, Heather took the last one. HEATHER: Sorry, dude. Really? Are there anymore? Major bummer, man! Thank you. What the fuck? Asshole! Hey Pinktrick, go to the corner store and get some more beer, man. More beer? With what? Hold on, I think I got some here. That. All right. (GIGGLING) Oh hey, Tina. I was wondering if after the art show we go back to my place and you let me Jackson Pollock all over your Georgia O'Keeffe. Let's Vincent van Gogh, baby. DONNA: Marissa, get over here! (CHEERING) VOICEOVER: Delta Pi! (HEAVY BREATHING) All right, Marissa, as you know, to be an official Delta Pi, we have to initiate you in. Allison, swat Marissa on the ass four times. Oh, I know it's coming. (LAUGHING) Assume your position. Bend over. Ooo hoo hoo, yeah! Holy shit! Bitching, woo! (YELPS) I'd like to say something, everybody. Okay, let's whip it out! No, wait! (SCREAMING) Shit, shit! Oh my God! VOICEOVER: Someone call the paramedics! I... I'm gonna get some help! Hang on! Hang on! Jonathan?! Holy shit! Hey, don't you know what's going on outside?! Where is everyone?! I think Jonathan's injured! Hey! Hey, assholes! (DRAMATIC STING) (EERIE MUSIC) Oh God! Are you okay? (GROANING) (SHRIEKING) (ELECTRONIC POP MUSIC) (ROCK MUSIC) Hey, pledge Delta Pi! Come check out the Delta Pi house tonight. See you tonight, right? Hey, come on, come check out Delta Pi! Woo, pledge Delta Pi! Woo! Come check out Delta Pi! Wow, I can't believe I'm finally going to college. Let me snap a picture. I wanna take in the moment. All right, right over here by the Sun State logo. Diana, I meant I take the picture. I want this to be memorable, not something you post on your profile. Fine, mom. Can you stand normal though, honey? You look like a duck like that. It's the in thing right now. Parents don't know anything. Mmmhm. Your kids will be saying the same thing to you when you're my age, just watch. Ugh, kids, no way. You want me to help you get settled? No, I'm good, Kelly and Adolfo will be here soon to help me unload. You need anything, you call me, all right? Of course. Thank you so much for bringing me. I'll see you next week, okay? Okay. Don't forget to call me. I won't. Political Science. That sucks. Yeah, well I wanted to pick something... (SCREAMING) Oh my God, Kelly! KELLY: Diana! Oh, my ears with this shit. We made it, we're officially college students! I know. Can I get your bags? No, I'm good. Come on, let's get outta here. All right, come on. (UNISON) Delta Pi until we die! Delta Pi until we die! Delta Pi until we die! Delta Pi until we die! (SOMBER MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (FLASHBACK SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC STING) Whoa. I'm sorry. Allison? I knew it, Donna Parker? How have you been? I've been doing well, I just dropped my daughter off at her first day of college. Wow, where has the time gone? It's been so long. (HEAVY BREATHING) Oh, yeah, I was deputized a few years ago. My father, he retired as Sheriff and he wanted me to stay in the business. After the incident and all. My brother, he's been very protective of me. So are you the new Sheriff? (LAUGHS) No, are you kidding? No, my brother, he's the Sheriff. I'm just a soulful deputy who's... (HEAVY BREATHING) I saw your vehicle and just decided to see if there was any trouble. I just wandered up here. There's so much history. Yeah. It's been ages since I've been up here. You know, it's best not to think about that night. It's all my fault. No one could've predicted it, Donna. Besides, we were young and stupid. Come on, let's get out of here before the memories really start pouring out. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ROCK MUSIC) (GRUNTING) You got me in the balls. (LAUGHS) Come on, Harry Hu, grow a pair! They went back in. Come on, I know you know martial arts. You're frickin Asian, Harry Sensei. Owen, seriously? That's racist. What? Harry, what are you again, Korean? I thought I told you a thousand times I'm Chinese. Not all of us know martial arts and quit calling me by my last name, you prick! Fine, from now on your name is Houdini for making your balls disappear. Shut up, Owen! Why did you kick him so hard? I didn't kick him that hard. He didn't kick me that hard. What? Yeah. The slightest touch can hurt it. If flicked in just the right spot. Right? Up top! Woo! Male anatomy's so confusing. (LAUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) All right, you good? Yeah. That's my Harry Hu. - Eww. - Eww. I swear I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached. Yeah, like there's anything up there anyway. Hello? Oh my God, Diana! (MUMBLE) lose a hand for flipping me off. That's retarded, dude. No one flips off the Owen. (SCREAMING) Never mind, she's gonna lose her voice. That wouldn't be so bad. Yeah, seriously. I can't believe it, we'll meet you there! That's why I normally put my phone in my pocket. They're here, come on! Owen, you're driving! Yeah, naturally. What?! Oh my God oh my God oh my God! Hey! Hey, how are you? Good, how are you? Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! (SQUEALING) You look nice. Thank you. Hey, where's Adolfo? He has a Chemistry project. Adolfo takes Chemistry? He actually does study Chemistry, but his project's not school related. If you know what I mean. Idiot. Only idiot is that total chud over there picking on that hipster kid. Ha, are you mad, bro? Huh? Are you real mad, bro? - Stop! - Come at me, bro, really come at me. Cut it out, man! Go help him. Give him a chance. I got a good feeling about him. I don't know. Whatever, you guys gonna rush? I could be in a sorority. I don't know, my mom told me not to join one. Why? I mean there's nothing wrong with them. Besides what's wrong with women in general. Don't be a douche. - Just a little. - VOICEOVER: Come on! Seriously though, Diana, they're there to support you, be a good group. It's not like it was a decade ago. Yeah, all white people. HARRY: They actually have a lot of cool traaditions and they kick you out if you don't get good grades. Yeah, that's fair enough. That is a cool tradition. Sorry to interrupt. I couldn't help to hear your conversation. You know, they're all right. I'm from Delta Pi sorority, times have changed. You should think about it. We're all sisters here and we take care of one another. We're here for each other whether times are good or bad. I'll think about it. Well come later today to the Delta Pi house. It's just around the corner, you can't miss it. You don't have to join, but just come see what being a Delta Pi's all about. Thanks. That was random. Very random. Anything smart to say? I'll go. I bet you would. (LAUGHING) - Come at me, bro! - Stop, man. - Come at me, bro. - Stop. Are you mad, what are you doing over here? Dude. What are you doing now? You trying to take a shower or something? You mad? You're really mad, okay? Come with me. Do you even lift? Revenge of the nerd! Yes, see, Owen knows best. What, you guys don't know the movie? It's a movie? The electric violin, Booger, that movie inspired my life! What? God, that was so long ago, I can't believe we went to that school. Yeah, I know. Yeah, you're probably thinking the same thing I am. What do you mean? You know, the murders. Did they ever find Katherine? The Delta Pi housemom? Yeah. No, they never found her body. It's a cold case. So that means the killer's still out there. Well he hasn't shown up since that day. Besides, they're reopening the Delta Pi house. Yeah, I saw. Do you know whatever happened to... Marissa Chambers? Yeah. All I know is she was taken to the hospital, that's pretty much it. What about Katey, how's she doing? She still at the psychiatric care? Yeah, I actually go and visit her every now and then, you know, just check in on her, see how she's doing. She really hasn't been the same since... Allison, I don't think any of us have either. OFFICER: Central to Allison, do you copy? Allison to Central. OFFICER: We spotted a 401 (MUMBLE) street for possible B&E in progress. Two SBs barged their way into a home. Stand by, trying to get further information. Copy that. Look Donna, I am sorry to cut this short. Are you kidding? You go do what you're best at. One quick question. Sure. Where is Katey now? I wanted to go visit her. Oh, she's over at Coastal Ridge. DONNA: The mental institution. Yeah, you know where it's at? Yeah, I passed by it a few times. Thank you, Allison. Oh, don't mention it, anytime. So apparently Harry's balls, they're still inside of him. Oh, are they? They are. Yeah, apparently we sold out again. Welcome everyone to the grand reopening of the Delta Pi house! Now this is a very exciting and rewarding time in our lives, Delta Pi has a long history beginning in the late 1800s when it was first created as a secret organization for women. Wow, that's long. Get that a lot. Tell your friends. Being a Delta Pi has a lot of rewarding benefits, so look over your brochures and make up your mind. We're here to help you in any which way we can. Did she say any which way? She did. Hey Cindy, I signed up a few girls on my end. Great, we'll find out who's true Delta Pi material. That's what we need to get the house back to standards after such a long time. Yeah, so here are a couple of the girls I have. Hi! Hi there! Have you decided? Yeah, actually, you and my girlfriends twisted my arm into signing up. Well that's great news, what's your name? Diana Parker. Parker? DIANA: Yes. Your mom wouldn't happen to be Donna, would it? Yeah, how did you know that? Yes, Bo, intrigue us. Your mom was actually a Delta Pi in the late eighties. The last of the Delta Pis. Wait, how did you... Actually, that's great news for you. You're automatically accepted into the sorority if your mother was a Delta Pi. Your mother is legacy. Diana, that's awesome news! You're so lucky! Wait, since we're friends with a Delta Pi, does that mean we get in? Well no, it doesn't work that way, I'm sorry. But if you show that you're dedicated enough to be a sister you'll be guaranteed induction. Sweet! Nice, will there be cake at the ceremony? (LAUGHS) Of course! And other treats. Oh, sign me up. Yeah, so that's how a threesome works. - Ooooh. - Ooooh. See, makes sense now, right? And we're gonna do it. I don't know, what do you chicks think? It seems promising, I'd take a bite. How about you, Diana? If you two agree, I'm in too. We could room together! Slumber parties? Boys! Twinning. What's twinning? What's twinning? Twins, and that means I'm winning. Let's get outta here. Let's go. (EERIE MUSIC) Mrs. Parker. Yes? Hello, I'm Doctor Pierce, this is Nurse Taylor, She'll be taking you to the visitor section. Hi. Hi. Mrs. Parker, would you follow us, please? I understand that you're not related to Ms. Caplan. Yes, that's correct. I'm, well, we were friends. Back in college. So she still goes by Caplan, huh? Katey never married. She was institutionalized in... March, 1989. She felt like she was being pursued by someone. Like someone were out to get her. She came here on her own accord. So she never left the hospital? She has. She's been in and out of here a few times. But this is the longest we've had her here. She can leave whenever she wants, but she still feels that being here is still safer for her. She's been here seven years and counting. Someone, someone tried to kill her? Mrs. Parker, we don't really allow unknown people to see our patients. It's normally close friends, family and occasionally law enforcement. But Katey asked to speak with you when we mentioned your name to her. No, no, I've seen it! It's coming for us all! Sir, you're gonna have to calm down before somebody gets hurt! Excuse me, I need to handle this situation. Laurie, can you see Donna over to the visitors quarters? PATIENT: Don't you hear me?! It's here! Doctor Moreau, just give the patient a sedative before he takes out my orderly! I got this, Doctor Pierce. This guy's been a pain in my ass all day with his delusional rants about some invisible monsters. Katey is sitting right over there in the corner. If you need my assistance, I will be right across the hall. Thank you. Katey? It's Donna. Donna Parker? I remember you. It's been a long time. I ran into Allison a couple weeks ago. Allison? Yeah. My how times have changed. Why are you here? I just, I wanted to see how you were. Uh huh. Why don't we skip to why you're really here. What do you mean? You want to know how I ended up in here, don't ya? You remember that night, right? The night we killed Marissa Chambers?! I didn't mean for... Well we deserve what's coming to us. There's still a few of us alive. The burnt one is coming. The burnt one? That night? At the Delta Pi house? I went back after the incident to wash away and forget what had happened. But when I got there... All the Kappa brothers and Pi sisters were dead! (LAUGHING) They were lying there in their own... Drying blood. Why are you telling me this? Because the burnt one won't stop until we've all suffered! Especially you! What? (GIGGLING) New bloodshed for the burnt one. We're all lambs left for the slaughter. Donna! (SINGSONG) The burnt one is watching... Waiting. They never should've opened it. They never should've opened it! They never should've opened it! They never should've opened it! Shut up, shut up, shut up, you crazy bitch! They never should've opened it! They never should've opened it! They never should've opened it! Shhh shhh shhh, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. They never should've opened it! (SOBBING) And if you look at the periodical table on the wall there, you'll understand the chemical elements better. All right, does anyone... Know what this is? Adolfo! Since you're paying close attention, do you know what this little thing is that I'm holding? Shit, did I drop one of them? PROFESSOR: Adolfo? That's not mine, Professor, I swear. Excuse me? Um... Oh, I know this one Mr, I mean Professor Sims. I'm asking Adolfo. Uh... You see? That's what happens when this generation forgets how to socialize in person and rather focuses their attention on fingering little handheld devices. (LAUGHING) Come on class, you know what I meant. Adolfo. Professor Sims, I was just doing what you asked us to do, I was piecing together the chemicals. Okay, well it's in your books. Well yes, I know that, but it's also on my phone. I have an App. There's an App for that? Apparently. How did I not know this? All right, well can you little smart phone tell you what I'm holding? No. Of course not. All right, what I am holding here is a cyanide pill that was confiscated by a U.S. Federal Marshal friend of mine. He removed it from a corrupt city council member when he was found guilty on all charges of accepting bribes for votes. So instead of spending his whole life in federal prison, he opted for the easy way out. He created this little suicide machine to take. But when the time came the coward couldn't bring himself to swallowing it. You see what I'm getting at? You don't have to be a chemist to know what you're doing. You just have to know what you're doing. Anyone can be a chemist, but it's better to learn the craft before you do something totally stupid like blow yourself up. All right, so that's your assignment for next week. I want you to pair up and create a potion, make it your own. That's all for today. I've bored you enough. I wasn't bored, Professor Sims. I learned enough from you in an hour that I would've in a week. Great. Damn, man. Adolfo. Yes, Professor Sims? You mind if I see that App? Sure, go ahead. Hmm, impressive. That certainly seems accurate. Well it should. It was developed by a chemist. I need to do this. You should, it's easy money. All right, well thank you. I'm looking forward to what your team comes up with next week. Thank you, Professor Sims. All right, I'll see you next week. All right. All right. Guess I'll just get my stuff here. So see you next week? Next week! ADOLFO: See you next week. See you next week! ADOLFO: All right. All right. Yo, what's going on, man? I got everything ready, don't worry about nothing. All right, I'll see you there later. All right, bye. Woof! Fucking shit, man. Dude, did you get it? Yeah. Oh, look at that face! It's being profiled right now. Y'all are dickheads, man. Glorious. Where's the shit, my nigga? Dude, I'm not black, man. How many times I gotta tell you that? You can be anything if you believe in yourself. So where's our friend molly? Bro, it's back in the classroom. But we can't go back in there, Professor Sims is in there. You serious? Yeah. If anything, we have to wait until later tonight. All right, we'll go back tonight, break in if we have to, use Harry Houdini's ninja magic! Fuck you, man. You need to start watching what you say. One day you're gonna say something stupid and get shot. Uh uh. Owen, don't you have that MMA fight tonight? Crap, what time is it? We gotta go! I'll drive. No offense. Wait, what? Oh fuck you. (LAUGHS) Dude, you know I love you, Harry Sensei! You've been in love with me ever since middle school. It's true, it's a crush. Whoa, you okay? It's my side, it's been hurting me for a few days now. Dude, you probably just swallowed your chopsticks. Seriously? Dude, eat some grapes, man. Now let's get the fuck outta here, man. Let's go, come on, come on. (EERIE MUSIC) Can I help you? Those pills I gave you earlier will help you to relax. Today's events were unexpected and I'm truly sorry for the mishap, Katey. Next time... There won't be a next time, Doctor Pierce. And I'm okay with that. It's justifiable. What is, Katey? My fate. Pardon me? You wouldn't understand. The burnt one. I see, that was 27 years ago, nothing else happened after that. Whatever transpired that night was a one time event. Do you still think the burnt one is coming after you? But I see it outside my window, Doctor Pierce. It's watching me. (SOBS) It's waiting for the opportunity. Go on, Katey, get some rest. We'll commence tomorrow in my office. Okay, Doctor Pierce. Very well, we'll talk tomorrow. (EERIE MUSIC) (BANG) (DRAMATIC STING) (SOBBING) (GAGGING) (COUGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SHRIEK) (LAUGHING) Kelly, that's not funny! Where'd you get that stuff from anyway? It was laying outside the Delta Pi house. Oh. Well hurry up, we gotta get ready for the Delta Pi bonfire. Okay. Okay girls, there's a tradition at Delta Pi and I wanna make sure we keep that tradition alive. Anyone have any guesses? I have a guess. (LAUGHING) This is so exciting. What is that? We're going to paddle your rumps. But to sooth the pain, we're gonna numb it with this bad boy. (CHEERING) I've never had any alcohol before. It's about time you did, girl, where have you been living, your mama's house?! - (LAUGHING) - Voiceover: Good one. (HEAVY BREATHING) Woo, that's some strong shit! Yup, they sure keep making it like they used to. I don't know, girls. Oh come on, Diana, we all did it. It's tradition, right, Cindy? Sure. Well how else are we all gonna be Delta Pis if we don't all drink? Just have one sip. Okay. (COUGHING) (CHEERING) Oh come on, Diana, seriously? Anyone up for a game of truth or dare? That's so nineties. I'm down for it. I'm up for it. Okay, who's first? I will since I came up with it. Excuse the hell out of me, sire, go right ahead. CINDY: I will. Truth or dare... Kelly! Truth, no wait... Too bad, you said truth. You much obey. Fine, truth then. Lame, but okay. Don't tell me you're gonna ask if I'm a virgin or not. Well I never! How do you know what I'm gonna say, what are you, psychic? Yes, I am. (GIGGLING) Wait, is that true? Yeah, is it true? Yup, next! Wait, what, what? (LAUGHING) No, that's not fair, Kelly! Life's not fair. Okay okay, truth or dare, Bo? Truth. What are you afraid of? Oh, 'cause I'm black I'm all of a sudden afraid of things?! Here we go. I didn't mean it like that. Look, we don't go downstairs in the dark, we don't venture off by ourselves when there's some loon following us and we're not gonna find out what "that sound" was or where it was coming from. If you wanna find out, go right ahead, I'm heading the other way! And another thing, if someone is running, I'm not gonna start an investigation. "Oh, why are you running?" I'm gonna run with them! And if it turns out they were jogging, then consider my ass humiliated, but at least I was safe unlike you clowns that facedwhatever that crazy someone was gonna do! So I take it you're afraid of everything. (LAUGHING) I'm not afraid of anything. I'm just cautious. There's a difference. Okay. All right. Mmmhm. Don't you mmmhm me. Don't mmmhm me! (HEAVY BREATHING) VOICEOVER: All right. (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) Lightweight. VOICEOVER: Afraid of that vodka. All right. I have a dare for all of us. I'm gonna skip the truth and go right to the dare. What is it? I dare you all to strip down and whoever dresses up first loses. What? I don't know about that, Bo. Oh come on, it's not like you've never worn a swimsuit before. I'm sure your bikini is more revealing than your panties is. Come on. I'll do it, but I'm not getting straight naked. That's what I meant. I'm not either. I'm up for it. I'm down for it. Well I'll go first since everyone thinks I'm afraid. I think you should. (CHEERING) VOICEOVER: Take it off! That's what I'm talking about, nice! Yeah! Ah, what the hell. What if someone sees us? That's what makes it more taboo. VOICEOVER: Whatever. VOICEOVER: (MUMBLE) the game. VOICEOVER: We have this place reserved. Hey! VOICEOVER: Shut up! (GIGGLING) Hey, Diana! Oh, like you've never seen breasts before? Fine, gimme that. - Now that's how you do it! - Now that's how you do it! So no one else is taking off their bras? Hell no, I'll embarrass you all! So I win then, what do I win? This. Ew, what is that? Relax, it's just a dummy. I found it while I was cleaning up. Supposedly they used it every bonfire ceremony. They burn the housemother to start the initiation process. It looks creepy. Why is it half burned? Josie can tell you that. Okay, sisters, get your asses up! What are you gonna do? We're gonna smack the crap outta ya! Chloe, Zoey, let's show these noobies how it's done. - Harder! - Harder! - Harder! - Harder! Come on, sisters, (HEAVY BREATHING) we're each gonna have to go through this. Even Bo and I. This is the tradition. It's been handed down and now we must abide by it. Jesus, I'll go first. There, right there. (GROANING) Next! Whoever is next, step forward. DIANA: Fine. Damn right fine, get over here and bend your ass over. All right, Diana, this is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt this wooden, unemotional piece of timber. There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? That hurt. Get over it. Okay, scary story time. It wasn't like today. There were no cell phones or high definition anything. Okay, enough story time, I gotta pee. Can you bring back more booze and snacks? Shit, forget it, I'll go with. You guys lose the dare, we win, ha ha! Oh shuttie industies. (GIGGLING) Hurry, I can barely hold it in. I'm going. Okay, let me continue with my story of the Delta Pi Massacre. She was a Delta Pi in the late eighties and survived that horrible night by pure luck. The night had already started with police documented proof that there had been murders at Sun State U. Okay, let's just skip to the juicy part, the part that my mom hates to talk about. (HEAVY BREATHING) There were only a few that were able to escape. The night started with a traditional ceremony. Not like the lame one we had. This was the eighties, so they had style back then. What I was told is that the head Delta Pi came up with a great way to humiliate Marissa by spraying her with silly string. But it ended up backfiring on her. While she was covered in this flammable string, she fell in this pit right here. It consumed her whole body within an instant. My mom said that the fire spread so quick, there was no time to put her out. Everyone screamed and ran from there. Everyone? I don't know, maybe a few stayed to put her out. There was no nearby phones, so they had to go to the nearest one which was at the gas station around the corner. So Marissa died? The story goes that Marissa died on the way to the hospital, but the worst part is that she had no parents. What happened to them? They were killed. But she was raised by her former housemother Katherine Jordan. She must have been devastated. But I'm not done yet. Marissa's accidental death isn't what closed Delta Pi. It's what happened after the incident. While Marissa was burning alive, there was a killer lurking around Sun State U. What?! You're kidding, right? No, this really happened. There's newspaper articles and television coverage if you look it up on the internet. (HEAVY BREATHING) They found over a dozen Delta Kappas and Delta Pis dead. All found in horrific condition. The medical examiner even wrote a book about it with all the crime scene photos. It was brutal. Shit! Did they ever catch the killer? No. Was it like a school serial killer or something? Police never said. The media called him The Sun State Menace. He left a scattered mess of blood and used that blood to leave his calling card. I can't take it! It's so creepy. Calling card? He used his victims' blood to write Die Die, Delta Pi! Oh my God. That's why the houses closed down. They were afraid someone was stalking the Delta Pi sorority. They issued a big city lockdown and closed Sun State for two weeks. But they never found the killer. And they ever found one body. Whose? Katherine Jordan's. The campus officials closed down the sorority two weeks later. But on a Halloween night that same year, a bunch of kids broke into the house and found Katherine's corpse covered in maggots in our very basement. I'm gonna have nightmares. I don't think I wanna go back to that house. Okay, okay, I just made that up. But seriously, they still haven't found her body to this day. And they say that her ghost haunts the house on the same night that she died. This very night. Yeah, right, Josie. I don't know, man, it sounds spooky. Was my mom there when it happened? Um... Man, that was a fucking great ass fight, man! I owned that bitch! No, you Owened him! Oooh hoo, I love it! ADOLFO: Hey, shh, shut up. It's open. (EERIE MUSIC) OWEN: He's dead. Who is that? Dude, that's Professor Sims! We need to call the police. No, we need to get outta here now! Shit. Shit, go, go! (GRUNTING) ADOLFO: Ah, shit! (GAGGING) What about Adolfo?! Just go to the police station, I'm getting him. No, my side hurts too much, - I can't go by myself. - Are you serious? Come on, let's go, move! (GROANING) Come on, Cindy, take it outside, you're gonna stink up my clothes! Sorry. Grrr, I knew it! (EERIE MUSIC) (BANG) (DRAMATIC STING) (GAGS) No! No! (SCREAMING) (SIZZLING) Cindy, was that you? (GAGGING) Cindy? Cindy? Oh my God, CIndy! (BEEP) Sun State Police Department, what is your emergency? OWEN: We need help to the Chemistry department ASAP, there's some crazy guy who's attacking everyone with a kitchen knife and I'm pretty sure he killed a teacher too. And how do you know this? OWEN: 'Cause he's not breathing! Please send help! What is your name? OWEN: I'd like to remain anonymous. This is crazy, there was one guy, Adolfo, I don't know where he is, oh God, I hope he's okay. I'm alrady sending units over there at your location. What's the room number? OWEN: Harry Hu! HARRY: Owen, seriously? OWEN: Owen's my last name. Anonymous, anonymous, what's the room number? Room number please? OWEN: I think it's 419. Okay, can you stay there for the police? OWEN: I'm anonymous, okay? This is nuts, I don't care how much training I had, I don't know what weapons he has, we have to go, Harry Hu! Goodbye! Hello? (BUSY SIGNAL) Hello? What's taking them? They're probably still at the house. It went staight to voicemail. All right, well we're practically out of beer, we're out of snacks. It's getting late too. I bet Bo and Cindy are at the house laughing it up and eating pizza. Bitches. Let's go, girls. You don't know what kind of weirdos the darkness brings out at night. Let's get the fuck outta here. (MUMBLE) my bra. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) We still have another body inside, but this is one of the other victims. All right, let me check and see who this is. Oh my God. Yeah, that's, that's Patrick. Something wrong, Allison? Yeah, we went to college together. Well nothing back there. Crime scene unit should have a lot to work with here. Hey, isn't it odd there are two different murders right after the other? Well it's like the massacre down at the mental hospital, same kind of thing. Looks like the ones who died were in the killer's way. Yeah. Whoa, Allison. ALLISON: What is it? There was something sticking out of the victim's pocket. It's a note. Look at this. What is that? Allison? Whoa, you okay, Allison? Yeah, I just got a little dizzy with everything. You guys gonna be able to handle this? Hey, you've been overworked. Take a breather, we got it from here. Yeah, I'll call it in. All right, thanks, guys. Yeah. (EERIE MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Donna, thank God you answered. What's wrong, Allison? It's happening again. What, what is? The killer is back. Diana... Please tell me that she's okay. ALLISON: I'm headed to the Delta Pi house now. DONNA: Then I'm coming. It's best you don't come here. It's dangerous. Beside, Katey's dead. Oh my God, I just saw her. Just stay at home. Lock your doors, your windows. I'm a sitting duck here, Allison, you think I'm safe? If the killer can get to Katey in the ward what makes you think that my house is any safer? I'm coming over there! It's my daughter, for Christ's sakes! ALLISON: Donna! OWEN: Hello?! Hello?! We need help! I really have to go to the bathroom. There's one right there. Go with me. Bro, what are we, in Delta Pi? Just go, I'll be right here. Okay. There you go. (BANG) HARRY: What was that? I don't know, I'm checking. (DRAMATIC STING) (GUN COCKING) You should've never gotten the police involved. See what you made me do? You crazy fucking bitch! What do you want from us?! Pain! Humiliation! Death! You don't have to do this! Please, I... Harry! Harry who?! (LAUGHING) Whatever it is we did, I'm sorry. I didn't do anything, what do you want?! Marissa pleaded for her life too. While she was being burned alive. You little shits just left her there to die! (GROANING) HARRY: I hope it's not my appendix. You ridiculed her because she was different! Because she was smart! She was to the face of Delta Pi! The way I should've. You? You are one butt ugly woman! (GUNSHOT) OFFICER: Central to Officer Toby. Allison needs your immediate assistance at the Delta Pi house. Copy that, Central, heading over there now. VOICEOVER: I wonder what's taking them so long? (MUMBLING) (DRAMATIC STING) (SCREAMING) (GASP) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (SCREAMING) Girls, get down! Get down! (GUNSHOTS) Fuck. You killed Marissa! Delta die! Shit. You silly little lambs! I'm gonna gut all of you little fuckers! Just like before. (GUNSHOT) Jeez. Hoo, that is one butt ugly woman. Hey, wait a minute. What? You recognize her? Yeah! That's the old Delta Pi housemother. Back in '86. I was a sophomore at Sun State U. I remember something strange. It was her and a young woman. I thought it was a prank. It had to have been a prank, didn't it? What do you mean? Shouldn't you be inside with the lambs left to slaughter? What are you doing? Oh. (EERIE MUSIC) I didn't realize it then. Man, if I'd only known. Wow. - Is she dead? - Is she dead? Who is she? I don't know. That would be Marissa Chambers. Girls, get in the car! Oh my God, Allison! (MUMBLE) Ms. Chambers. The few... That got away. I almost had you back then. I almost got you now. You should've let me die back then. You should've... Finished me off. It's over, Donna. It's finally over. Shit, I'm glad that's over. What's that smell? Ew, did you fart?! (CLICK) I can't get out! (SCREAMING) Get me the fuck outta here! VOICEOVER: Here kitty kitty. (ROCK MUSIC)
