What the fuck are you doing here? Faster, Horty, move. But it would be better you save your strength for tomorrow. I've bet 20 francs on you. You'd better win, huh? - No way, this year Horty's going to lose. 30 francs on Lacroix. - Shut up, he's the favourite. He can't win every year. Lacroix hasn't a little woman shagging him every night. Hey, d'you know why President Simeone doesn't say what the prize is this year? Because the prize is to spend a night with his wife. Horty. Are you OK? They say that this year's prize will be special. Is that so? If you win, we could leave. Where to? I don't know. You've been too close to the fire again. You have a huge red spot on your chest. Does it hurt when I touch you? - No. Why do you speak of going away? Aren't you happy here? Maybe we'd be better somewhere else, right? You're going to win, Horty! On your marks. Ready? Horty, courage! Horty! Come on, Horty! Come on! Come on, Horty! Come on! You're going to win! Come on, Horty! I declare Horty winner for the third time in a row of the Simeone foundry great annual contest. But, but, but. But this year Horty will get a special prize. And that special award I must say, has cost our company a fortune. Thanks to everyone's work, of course. And this very, very special prize is... To attend the departure of the Titanic. The Titanic, Horty. The largest, unsinkable ship in the world. Hundreds of meters long, two stories high. A real floating city, a billion francs worth. It'll set sail from Southampton April 10. And you Horty, will leave us tomorrow to go to England. Well, what do you say, Horty? The Simeone Foundry rewards its best workers. You're happy, I guess. Yes. We leave tomorrow? We? Zoe and me. - Are you kidding or what? Know how much it cost me, your trip to England and back, plus one night in an English hotel? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. A fortune. But never mind, I don't regret it. Here. Have a good trip. But we have two tickets for England. I know Menier, but I want little Zoe just for myself. Here. My salamander. To bring you luck on the trip. White Star toothpaste is the best one. This hotel is strictly reserved for passengers of the Titanic, Sir. Yes, Titanic. I have a reservation. Sorry, I don't understand. It's free, it's for you. Are you French? Where from? Feuillange. In Lorraine. And you've come here? - I've come for the Titanic. Room 66. This way, Sir. Follow me. Have a good stay. Thank you. White Star toothpaste kisses are the sweetest. Your room, Sir. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. You're French, right? Excuse me. Tomorrow I depart on the Titanic. I work there as a chambermaid, but I don't know where to spend the night. All the hotels are full and I was told at reception that you're just passing through and... And that... And that... And that? And that maybe you wouldn't mind giving your room up to me. Giving my room up to you? Yes. But, what about me? Where'd I go? I don't know. I understand. Excuse me, sir. Goodbye. Wait. If you want, we'll manage. Sir... Yes? Are you asleep? No. And you? Me neither. Do you want to come? Where? Here, by my side. I don't take up much space and you'll be more comfortable. Come on. You have a hot body. It's because I work in a foundry. What is this animal? A salamander. What's your name? Horty. Mine is Marie. Horty. On this side. On this side. Excuse me, sir. What... what do you want? - The photo. This photo. Welcome, Horty! Hello, Horty! Horty! Hello, Horty, how are you? How did it go? Tell us. Is it true that English women have no tits? Have you spent all of your money? Leave him alone. Can't you see he's tired? Well, you'll have all the time to see and hear him, right? Let me pass, let me pass. President Simeone wants to speak. Horty, Horty, at last you're back. Welcome. Horty, you've seen great things. You've seen England. Southampton. You've seen the best hotel in Southampton. And above all, seen the Titanic sailing on the majestic ocean waves. You are an important man now. And as such, you see things from above, from far above. You'll now work on the top of the tower, in maintenance. It will be good for you. Thanks to Zoe you'll have a quieter job. Zoe has been very kind with the president. For whom, as you know Horty, it's an honor to work. It's great you're in maintenance. From up there you'll be able to see me work. You deserve to be in the heavens. The heat damages your skin. Up there is fresh air. What's this? Toothpaste! You bought it for me? What's wrong? Since you've come back, you haven't said a word. Maybe it's the trip that's made you so. I understand. England's far away. My salamander! You're still wearing it. What's this red mark on your neck? I don't know. But, what's wrong? Horty, where are you going? To the bar. It's been a week we've not seen each other and you go to the bar? You travel to South South don't know what! I stay here waiting for you, without sleeping, without eating. And when you arrive, you go to the bar. - Why are you dressed like that? For you. Remove that lipstick! Okay, go to your bar! I don't want see you again. Hello, Horty, how are you? What will you have? - A Mirabelle. All right, Horty? Well, what's wrong with you? What's that picture? Let me see. Manu, come and see. You guys, come and see Horty's new woman. She's beautiful. Who is she? A very beautiful girl. She looks like a little girl. - Little girl? Not at all! How much does a girl like her cost a night? In this dog's life that happens only once. - What only happens once? To screw a woman like that. Have you screwed her? No. You haven't screwed her? So, what did you do? I slept with her. - You slept with her and didn't screw her? Do you think we're morons? Just a moment, Horty, just a moment. Drink what you want. You don't have to pay, it's on us. But listen, tell us everything, okay? Come. Come. Sit here. Well, what'll you drink? A Mirabelle. - Lou, bring the Mirabelle bottle. Now, tell us. How you screwed her? I didn't screw her. Come on, Horty. I'm your friend, you know me. Zoe won't find out. Well, where did you meet her? Was it at the hotel in Southampton? Was it there? The photo. Here it is. She was a chambermaid. Quiet! Go on. I was taking off my shoes, A knock on the door. I went to open it... And I saw her. She asked me if she could sleep in my room. - The girl has courage. Shut up, Manu. Well then, what did you do? I said no. - Is it possible? She was so beautiful. Well, I let her sleep in my bed, and I went to sleep on the couch. What's her name? Marie. Tell us about her ass. I didn't see it. - Didn't you see her ass? Well... I didn't see it right away. Come. You have a hot body. It's because I work in a foundry. It seems you're afraid of me. Do you despise me? Why? For making you come here, near me. This is the first time, you know? That I ask a man a thing like this. To sleep with me. Are you okay? Yes. Me too. You don't talk much. You're right. What can one say when he wants to kiss someone? What heat! Don't you think? You want some? I love you. Don't you paint your lips? I'll paint them for you. It's extraordinary. Where are you going? - I'm going home. Wait, you're not gonna leave us like that. What happened next? She just sucked your finger? - Stay. What are you gonna do at home? And maybe Simeone is screwing your wife. Let him go, Horty! Stop it! Stop! What's wrong? It was a joke. He wasn't thinking. He said it was a joke. Calm down. Go home. Come on. Is it true what they say in the bar? What do they say in the bar? That you've slept with the boss. Is it true or not? - Leave me alone! Did you do it so I'd be promoted? Was that the reason? What bastard put that in your mind? Do you think I went to bed with President Simeone? Tell us again about the chambermaid. Come back, Horty! Come back, Horty. What did he say? Come back, Horty. Come, Horty! Horty! Horty, show us again your photo! And tell us about her ass! Who's that chambermaid? Who knows? Can't you see they're drunk? Leave him alone! Let's go to the bar. Swine. Now I can see why you didn't want to hug me before. Why you were as quiet as a mouse. Didn't want to make love to me because you've just been with the other one in England, right? Do you want to know? Yes, I have made love to Simeone. And I really liked it. He did with me whatever he wanted. Get out! So, did you screw her or not? I screwed her, yeah. Tell us about it. She took me to the Titanic to show me... - Her pussy? Yeah. Yes, her pussy. And the ship. Are you afraid? Afraid of what? Was it the first time you were with a woman who wasn't yours. Make the most of it, Horty. You only live once. We'll never forget what we're going to live. Wait, wait. You screwed her in the street? Well, yes. We were so excited we couldn't wait. I've always fucked at home. She wanted to show me... - Her pussy. No. The boat. She wanted to show me... the boat. Do you know how much the ship weighs? More than 20,000 tons, and there are more than 2,000 passengers. Come. Thousands of bottles of champagne cooling in the warehouse. And $300 million in jewelery. Everybody's working for tomorrow's big party. Come quickly. We made love like wild animals. I couldn't any more. And she wanted me to recover my strength. Drink some more, it'll do you good. I've never met anyone so loving as her. I made her head spin. She kept telling me: "Make love to me, Horty. Horty, I love you so much." We couldn't stop. And then, back to the hotel and... And what? I say we couldn't stop. We did it again and again. At least... At least twelve times. Twelve times? That's impossible. A man can't stand it. One night I did it five times. We don't give a shit about your five times. Shut up and let him talk. Are you sure in what you say, Horty? Twelve times? Twelve times. She said: "Horty... it would be great, dying of love." Dying of love. Horty. When I return from America I will find you. I'm sure. You'll wait for me. And I'll find you... Wherever you'll be. I have never loved as I love you. I can't any more. Horty Marie! Marie! I listened to her heart. I thought she was really dead. Come on, tell us how it was under the table. Better, on the footbridge. When you took her from behind in front of the Titanic. No, under the table was better. And her pussy? Yes, her pussy. Tell us the "under the table" stuff. Did you screw her in front of the Titanic? Lacroix. Lacroix. It seems the Titanic has been shipwrecked. What did you say? I can't hear anything. It seems the Titanic has been shipwrecked. Leon. The Titanic has sunk. At 2:20 in the morning, the vessel sank to the south of Newfoundland. Turn the page and look for survivors. - Marie'll have escaped. She's a clever girl. Here it is. The list of survivors. The crew. Is her name there? What's her name? Marie "what"? Zoé, the Titanic has sunk. Zoé, The Titanic has sunk. Horty, too. Let me see. Look. They say it's the greatest disaster of all time. That's right. He's gone completely mad. Just when he's been promoted. He's lost his mind. And I have lost him. He won't return to me. It'll pass. It's like everything, huh? Why don't you go and see him? - No. It scares me to see him so lonely. Horty. Horty. Horty! Horty, for God's sake! Are you gonna spend your life there? Come back home! What are you trying to do, huh? You need Zoe. Look, all they say about her and Simeone is just a lot of gossip. Zoe loves you. How could she do that to you? Well, come on. I heard he tells strange stories at Lou's. What? What kind of stories? About a chambermaid he must've known on the Titanic. There's no one like you for bullshitting. Anyway, his chambermaid has drowned in the ice. What's happening here? Is nobody working today? Come on. It's about Horty. Now he sleeps up there. So what? I don't care. If he works during the day, he can sleep wherever he wants. I want you to tell him nothing has happened between you and me. I want Horty back. All that gossip has turned him crazy. He doesn't come home at night. - Calm down. I'll tell him. Do you promise? Yes, I promise. Nothing happened between us. Absolutely nothing. What's that? Horty has gone mad. Move away, Menier! Horty! You wanted to kill me, didn't you? Well, you're fired! Fired! It's over! What are you looking at? Get back to work. Get back to work! Marie was stretched out. She was still breathing, but didn't say a word. I didn't know how to wake her up. Hey, how did you revive her? Quiet, women. I've paid and I have the right to ask questions. No! Can't you see Horty's speaking? Shut up or clear off. Come on, Horty, speak! Yeah, go on. She was wonderful. Look who's just walked in? What is she doing here? Go on, Horty. I've never seen a woman so beautiful. Come on, Horty, go on! I had only my caresses to bring her back to life. Just my caresses. I could still hear her laughter. I would've liked so much to see her dancing. She was dead. I kissed her and brought her back to life. With my tongue. Horty. You're here. I was sleeping full of love. Thanks for having brought me back to life. It's been wonderful. I've never felt so much love. You deserve to be in heaven, Horty. Did you do that? What? Did you touch her tongue with your tongue? Yes. Horty, what are you doing? Come back, Horty! Tomorrow I'll double the price of the drinks. Don't touch me! Do you think I'm a chambermaid? And he thought you were a whore! - The president never touched me! Is it my fault he likes me? He wanted something for giving you a better job. I don't want it, I prefer the foundry. - It's all because of the Titanic. Why did you have to go and see how it sailed? Look what's happened to us now. Come on, don't cry. Forget it all. Forget it? How can I forget it if now you've told it to everyone? But I made it all up. - That's a lie. I never went to bed with that chambermaid. I told them all that because they like it, you've just seen it. Besides, now she's dead. Do you swear nothing happened between you two? I swear. Why do you tell those stories if nothing happened with that woman? I don't know. I make it all up. I tell what I dream of doing with you. I know you've never lied to me. But I can hardly believe that nothing happened with that chambermaid. Do you know what I want to do now? What? Spray you with champagne. Undress you and spray you with champagne. You're completely crazy. Swear that you'll never go back to the bar to tell those stories. I told them I'd go tomorrow. Don't do it. I'm your only woman. They'll understand. What are you saying? - What you hear, Al. Horty won't tell those stories again. Will you, Horty? You've got no job. They've fired you. You've nothing else to do than come and tell those stories. Come on, you can't do this to us. He can. Horty and I agree. What did you do before? You were doing fine without his stories. Before was before. That's true, huh? Before was before. Since you've been listening to Horty, strange things happen in the bedrooms. The nights are different. - Yes, indeed. We sleep so little. Yesterday, Blanche was late for work. I'll remember it all my life. Besides he kisses me with his tongue. Well, what's up? Lou is desperate, tonight the bar is full. Why don't you want to talk? Have you gone crazy or what? Well, Lou will keep the tips. What tips? The tips he wanted to give to Horty. And I swear it's a lot of money. Well, as Horty doesn't want to go there again. Wait. Listen, I want him to go on. But on one condition. What? Let everybody know Horty has made everything up. Stop! Stop! Wait here. Her lips were red like blood. She had painted them for me. I liked her lips like that. Red. Juicy, like fruit. She asked me to spray her with champagne. That's what he's done with me. Really? - Yes. With Champagne? I asked her. Yes, with Champagne. She answered me. Then I took a bottle. It was the first time I'd opened a bottle of champagne. It's difficult to remove the cork. And suddenly... It's over for tonight. Bravo, young man. Bravo. My name's Zeppe. Actor. I've traveled more than 100 kms to see the guy who was competing with me. I confess I was determined to smash his face in. But you have captivated me. Catastrophes are my speciality. I had a huge success with the eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79 AC. A slave in love with her master dies buried under the burning lava while she was trying to save him. Have you heard of her? The slave? No, sir. Don't call me sir. You can call me Zeppe. Zeppe. No, don't emphasize the "Z". It's between "Z" and "S". It's like if you put a D before. DZeppe. Zeppe. You got it. Who's that man with the furs? He's a man who goes touring with his traveling theater. Horty has become famous. They come from far away to hear him. To hear what? To hear his stories. It must be weird to share your man with a woman he's made up. I swear, Horty, you've got a great future ahead. That is, a future that smells a fortune. My latest show about the China earthquake, is a huge success. Why don't you come and play the Titanic with me? No, no, no, I can't. Besides, it's all fake. - That doesn't matter. Wouldn't you like to act in a theater? With its red curtains and decorations. And a caravan. Wouldn't you like to live in a house that moves along with you? Won't you introduce me? Zoe, my wife. I'm Zeppe, impresario of a travelling show. It's an honor for me to meet the wife of a great actor like Horty. An actor? - Didn't I tell you he was famous? Do you doubt it? Sure, he lacks technique. But he has imagination. No imagination, no talent. Let me handle it and I'll make him an actor, a great actor. With a pencil in your mouth and an onion one can work miracles. What are you saying? It can't be. I don't want Horty to talk about another woman. Not for 100 francs a week? How much? - 100 francs a week! 100 francs a week! Gee up! I'm so happy. From now on, I'll paint my lips everyday. Just like she did. I have the impression that we're starting a new life. Don't you? You're like an angel fallen from heaven, Zeppe. Gee up! That's it, very good. Now do a double. Okay. Under the leg. Mix it a little. Ah, look? Higher! Higher! Double it. Bravo! Bravo, Giovanni! Bravo! What's wrong? Kiss me. Make love to me, like you did to her. I've never made love to her. Then, like you say you did. Spray me! Like in your story! You know? Zeppe asked me for Marie's photo. What for? I don't know. After new Pompeii was swallowed 4 kms deep. Why are you so nervous? I don't want to act. I'm not an actor. In the bar maybe, but here. Oh, yes, you are. Come closer! You there, come here! Come closer to listen to the wonderful love story of Horty and Marie which took place on the great Titanic while it was wrecked in the ice of the North Pole. Music, Giovanni! When on the spring night April 15 the iceberg, a huge mountain of ice, hit the ship, there was a huge cry. "Women and children first!" cried the captain. No, I can't. What are you saying? And in less than an hour... Are you listening? In less than an hour the world's most beautiful ship had sunk to the seabed. 500 people... men, women and children lost their lives. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight a man has returned from that hell without his beloved. And this man, is behind the curtain. He's going to tell their love story. His name is Horty. The survivor of the Titanic. Come! It's your turn. - I can't go on stage! Horty, survivor of the Titanic Applaud and he'll come on stage. Her name was Marie. Louder! Her name was Marie! She was a chambermaid on the Titanic. I'd never... I've never seen such a beautiful woman before. Her skin was so smooth. Her hair was soft. Lack of excitement! We need some feeling! Are there any onions left? The first time we looked at each other our hearts beat madly in the dark. Her eyes were glittering like two stars. Words were meaningless. We knew we were in love. I don't understand you. You want me to tell my story but it makes you cry. What do you want? To know the truth. - What truth? That you love that woman! It's impossible to tell those stories so well. Her skin, eyes, hair. I'm sure you've touched them. No. I could only hear your story on one condition. What condition? HORTY, THE SURVIVOR OF THE TITANIC! Our lips were kissing as that huge block of ice came in front of our love. The chill of death. That was it! It was death coming out of the waves, to take her away from me! We were in each others arms on the bridge. A long time. It was cold. Then the ship tilted. And Marie disappeared under a wave. Then I wanted to die and I threw myself into the icy waters to drink up the ocean. But someone's arms, hoisted me up. Marie. Marie! Come back to me! How was I? Gorgeous. And from that April 15 on... I console myself by talking of her. Thanks for listening. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! It's a success. It's a success. They're clapping wildly. What's wrong with you? - Nothing. I want to go on stage. - No, come here! Zeppe, I have to tell you... - What? Zoe would like that the picture of Marie wasn't on stage. I do the staging, Horty. I'm the director. And it's me who hired you, not her. In no time, she'll play on stage too. She took a curtain call with you yesterday. I'm warning you, Zoe will do nothing more than she's doing right now. An appearance and that's all. Well, don't get me wrong. It's not easy for her. The picture will remain on stage. If Zoe isn't happy, you can leave. I'm fed up, I feel like quitting. Quitting? You're turning down show business? You have a caravan, money. All the comforts an artist needs. Horty, in a few months, the way things go we'll be travelling by truck all over the country. No more horses! We'll act in theaters, my friend. In real theaters. With sets, boxes and we'll sleep in a hotel. And you say you want to quit? Have you lost your mind or what? What a beautiful angel! Why is he holding a bow? What is he hunting? Come with me, Zoe. You've talked to him? - He didn't want to. What can I do, he's the director. He won't change what's working. It's normal. Listen. He told me we'll soon be sleeping in hotels and acting in theaters. It's nothing, that picture. I agreed you talk of another woman who wasn't me. And I believed I was the one who inspired you. But I don't like that big picture. I can't stand it! Why isn't my picture on stage? We were gliding on the polar waters. But we didn't feel any cold. Our kisses kept our hearts warm. My love for Marie was so great... I saw... a cupid appear. But then... A thick mist covered the whole ocean. And there in the night fog... I saw a mountain of ice coming towards our love. Marie. Marie! Don't go! Marie! Why does the sea take her instead of me? Why is fate so cruel? Oh, Cupid! You have pierced us with your arrow of love. Why? Horty. Hey, what's the matter with you? What's wrong? Horty! Where are you going? Are you crazy? Horty! Come here, Horty! He's crazy! Giovanni! Go on stage, go! I'll go and see. Come, come! Quick, quick! Go on, go on! Are you looking for Marie? Are there Indians in the audience? My name is Pascal. Do you recognize me? We met in the hotel lobby in Southampton. You said you were from Lorraine. Don't you remember? Marie's not dead? You can't read, I guess. 20 chambermaids were rescued out of 23. Marie wasn't on the list. Well, because her name isn't really Marie. That's the way she is. There's a different name for each customer. For you its Marie, for others it'll be Sandra or Berthe. That amuses her. Hey, you've had a great success with your stories. We've heard a lot about you. We've come a long way to see you. Horty! Horty! Horty! Marie? Your name is Marie? Yes. I'm Horty's wife. The man who loves you. Horty has a lot of imagination. And you live pretty well. Pascal and I live much worse. We'd like our share. That's why I'm here. Let's see. The one who's inspired your stories is Marie, is it clear? Without her you'd be working in your hole, wouldn't you? You're traveling thanks to Marie. So? I don't think you understand. If you'd have had money in Southampton we wouldn't be here. Marie has stolen a lot of wallets in those hotels. Believe me. But when she searched your room, she didn't find anything. We were wrong about you, you were broke. Where is she? What for? She doesn't want to see you. You've disappointed her. You didn't even screw her. Shut up! Shut up! Marie is not a whore! Understand, bastard? Calm down! You want to talk to her? You want to see her? She's in the car! Don't you believe me? Go! Giovanni! Come, come, come! Take that, come on, come on! Are you going to tell me what's happening? - Don't worry, everything is fine. You are stealing the money from the tickets. I'm not stealing it, I'll give it back. You'll understand later. Are you looking for someone? The girl who was here, just where you are. Who are you? I'm her husband. What do you want from her? Is she married? What do you want from her? I want to give her this. And now, go away. Right now. We don't want to see you again. What happened? Where were you? I've asked you a question! - Leave me be. Giovanni. Giovanni! Come here! Come! Ladies and gentlemen... My name is Horty "the impostor". I'm back here to tell you that everything I've told you before... That story with the chambermaid on the Titanic... is a lie. I never boarded the Titanic. I've never touched Marie. But I've loved her more than anyone else. Giovanni! Ladies and gentlemen, Marie is not dead. I've seen her again. Tonight. In this theater. She was sitting there. Then, she went, just like a dream. So I went out after her. And in front of the theater... I saw her. You don't know me. I'm a bitch, understand? A whore. You think I want you? I don't love you. I don't love you! Horty, let me go, please! I must go! With whom? The guy in the car. No, you don't know me. I'm not who you think I am! I'm a whore. A whore! You think I want you? I don't love you. No. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! She's dead. I've killed a woman named Marie. And she wasn't the one that I loved in England. I've given her back to the sea that had desired her. She'll meet all the rest from the Titanic. And all the things that sleep on the ocean floor. I will never see her again. But as long as my heart keep beating it will be beating for her. I don't want to see you again. I will tell about Marie just for myself. The one who is on my mind. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Horty, have you killed her? Have you really killed her? Don't you worry, Zeppe. With an onion, one can make miracles. Why that face? We have the money, haven't we? Would you like him to touch you? Is that it? You'll never convince me that nothing happened between you and that poor guy. We were gliding on the polar waters. But we didn't feel any cold. Our kisses kept our hearts warm. Her eyes were glittering like two stars. Our hearts were beating fast. Our lips were touching. We were in each others arms on the bridge. A long time. And then, that huge block of ice came in front of our love. The ship tilted and she disappeared under a wave. Then, I wanted to die. And I threw myself into the icy waters to drink up the ocean. My love... Come back to me. And from that April 15 on... I console myself.
