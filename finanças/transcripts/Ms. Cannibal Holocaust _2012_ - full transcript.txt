[ominous synth music] [record scratches] - This gonna be a great movie. [ominous synth music] [brooding electronic music] [wind blows] [suspenseful music] - And we took all his cities and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the children of every city. We left none to remain. [suspenseful music] [footsteps clack] [lock clicks] [moody electronic music] - Sweetie. I just lost my reception. Where's your phone? Kirk! - The fuck, Julie? You sound like a god damn crow. "Cuckaw!" It's over there. - Yours doesn't have any reception, either. - Really? It was working just fine before. But hey, that's what 50-plus years of lead paint will do. Fuck with the reception. Fucking shit hole. It's like a tomb. They can't tear it down fast enough. Sad ending to a building that once catered to the richest people in the area. - How many tenants are left? - There's three apartments still occupied. I don't know what the fuck they're waiting for. They start demolition at noon tomorrow. - Maybe they have nowhere to go. - Whatever. Fuck 'em. - Fuck. Fucking internet. Fucking internet! What the fuck? - [Man] That bitch say what? - That bitch said he was better the first time. - Yeah but I heard her thighs like shaking and shit. - That's 'cause you had that 300-pound head on top of that hub. - Fuck you, man. - You're lucky that big-ass head ain't crushed you for real, man. - Yo whatever, man, like I give a fuck about what some chick from the club I picked up said. Shit, that hoe lucky I slunk into her ass. - Yeah, you don't care now. But look, for real? The bitch said you had a little dick. - What? Man, fuck her. Shit, picture that. A girl saying I got a little dick after I fucked her and left her with a stain to clean. Shit. She just mad she got played. 'Cause trust me, ain't no girl ever complain about my shit. And you can ask your mama on that one. - Oh, don't get fucked up, motherfucker. I'm just sayin' what the bitch said. For real. She could've said your shit was average. I really wasn't payin' no attention. - Whatever, man, but trust me. Me and little dick Jones been making bitches' memories for years. - [Woman] What're you thinking about Stan? - Nothin'. - It'll be okay. You're a good man. - A good man? Ma, to tell you the truth, I don't feel like a good man. - [Mother] Moving in with my sister is only gonna be temporary. You've always taken care of us. It'll be okay. - [Stan] Yeah, Ma, that's what you said when Amy left. - [Mother] I promise. [lock clicks] [woman moans] - Yeah, you like that shit, right? - Yeah, I like that. [moans] - That's all 12 inches. [indistinct] - [moans] Yeah, it's touching my heart. - That shit's gonna be pumpin' sperm for once. Hey, hey. Shit on my chest. - [Woman] [sighs] I don't have to shit. - [Man] Well, then piss in my mouth. - [Woman] Baby, I don't have to piss. - Well, stick a finger up my ass. Do somethin'. - What? - It's somethin' I saw on TV. - What TV show was that? - All right, it was my friend's DVD. Just pinch my nipples, slap my face. Do somethin'. [woman moans] Now call your sister. - What? Fuck you, man. My sister's like 15. - With that makeup she looks like she's at least 16. [radio bleeps] [switches click] [dark synth music] [distant alarm buzzes] - What the fuck? The power wasn't supposed to be cut until morning. [knocks] - Who the hell is that? - How the hell would I know? Who the fuck is it? [yells] - [Julie] Kirk? [yelps] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] [door slams] - Hey, Kirk. Is everything all right down there? [suspenseful music] [screams] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] - Was that a scream? Why are the emergency lights on? - I don't know. - What floor was that on, man? - Hey, where the twins at? - I ain't seen 'em. - What the fuck was that? - Speak of the devil. - Hey, it sounded fuck up, whatever it was. - All right, you all wait here. [eerie music] [ominous tones] - You all packed? - I don't have shit to pack. - Okay, well- - Get up outta here. - I might as well just leave my stuff at the door. - Hey, yo, the elevators are out. - Of course. The power's out, genius. - Yeah, I was just double checking to make sure it wasn't just the lights. - Maybe there's a fire. - [chuckles] Yeah, fire. You smell smoke? - No. - Baby, the alarm would go off if there was a fire. - Well, do they work when there's no power? - Yo, Cee, where you goin'? - Back passage, word with the manager. [door creaks] [ominous music] - Yo, that's weird. The lights are on down here. - Shh, shh, shh, shh! Listen. [distant scraping] - What is that? The manager? - Kurt! [distant scraping] [footsteps clack] - What is that? [scraping] [footsteps clack] [brooding electronic music] - Vengeance belongs to me. - What the fuck? - Yo, somethin' tell me that ain't the movers. - No shit. - Move! [door slams] - That locks from the outside, right? [door thuds] [door creaks] - My phone don't work. - Mine neither. - What about the landline? - I tried the phones. They're dead. - Again. No electricity. - You don't need electricity for phones to work. - Besides, they were on over there. - What the fuck we gonna do, man? - All right, there's a back stairwell. We take it down to the first floor, past the elevators, and then afterwards we just go out the back door. - You don't think they got that shit covered? - We're gonna hope they don't. - I don't like those odds. - Well, anyone else got a better idea? 'Cause where I see it, that's all we got. - Look, I got one. Look, it's called operation Save Ass. Okay, me and Meir go in one of these apartments, barricade it up as best we can, and kill every motherfucker who tries to come through. - Yeah, that's what's up. [Twins inhale sharply] - Brilliant. You two learn that at the Special Olympics? - Hey, Cee. Get your bitch, dude. - Hey, get your bitch, motherfucker, for real. - All right, guys. Come on, come on. Look, guys, we gotta stick together. You know how it is. It's like in the movies. - This ain't the fuckin' movies, man. - If this was the fuckin' movies, Little J would be dead. - Exactly. - All right, maybe not. But we can't hold up. You saw how many there were. They can't have all the doors covered. All right. We gotta stick together, all right? Agree, Little J? Meir? All right, let's go. Come on. - Come on, baby. Let's go. - Aw, man! It's locked! [door thuds] - [Stan] Kurt must've skirted for tonight. - Dad. - Hey, kids. We got company. - Get behind me. [door creaks] - Yo, I thought the elevators didn't work? - They did. Go! - No, no. Down, down! There's a back door in the basement that leads to an alley. [door creaks] [door slams] - Hey, yo, the electricity's on down here too? - The electricity in this building's fucked up. - Big surprise. - [Little J] This door was never locked. - What about down that way? - Dead end. - I say we get back to the elevator before it's too late. - He's right. Come on, let's go. Back! Find somewhere to hold up. - In here! - Ma, Ma. - No, Stan, not in here! - There's no lock. - This shit's a dead end. - We need a weapon. Is anything in here? - I got nothin'. - Same here. - Hey, what're you doin', man? - I'm gonna buy some time. - Hey, what're you, Magnum PI or somethin'? - It's MacGyver, asshole. Get it straight if you're gonna bust on me. [electricity buzzes] We need to find something else before we lose electricity again. [suspenseful music] [generator whines] - Find something to open it. [bus engine roars] [bus engine roars] [bus engine roars] [brooding electronic music] - Hey. Hey! Wake up! Come on! Wake up! - [Driver] Hey, leave her alone! - [Passenger] She's just some junkie. [crickets chirp] [bus engine roars] [eerie synth music] [water splashes] [suspenseful music] [muffled thuds] [muffled thuds] - Creepy motherfucker. What do you want with us, you son of a bitch? - Kay, can you chill out? [muffled thuds] - [Kay] How long are these lights gonna last? - Ask the electrician. Stan! Look, I don't know. Maybe four hours. - What're we gonna do? How the fuck are we gonna get outta here? - There's no way out. All we can do is hold out. Hope someone comes looking for us. - We don't even know what they want with us. - I think it's safe to say they wanna fuck us up. - [scoffs] Yeah. And we heard the screams. It must've been Dan. Where's the fuckin' manager? - But why us? What did we do? - [Cee] Hey, did y'all hear that story about the cannibal cult on the news? Maybe it's them. - [Little J] They're not fuckin' cannibals. - [Cee] Why the fuck not? - [Little J] They don't look like cannibals. - [Cee] Oh, they gotta be black with like a bone through their nose and all that shit, right? - I'm just saying, all right? We're proud of that shit. Keeps you crackers in line. - I thought they only attacked gangs? - But there was a one story about that cop and his family, though. - Look, I think you guys are all missing the point. Why the fuck us? - [Little J] [scoffs] Why not, right? They're cannibals. Fuckers gotta eat. - [Kay] So that's it? Just our bad luck? - [sighs] Maybe it's got something to do with the building being demolished tomorrow. - Hey, hold up. First off, anyone got any gum? [Cee chuckles] - Here. - Second off, what do you say y'all watch the F-bombs in front of my daughter? - Seriously? Motherfuckers are trying to eat us and you're worried about- - Third. Kay's right, this ain't random. This is an assault. Think about it. The phones are out, they cut us off. They're military like organized. They knew where we were before they got here. They tracked us. Maybe they didn't know about this room. Maybe they did, but either way, they got us where they want us. - Look, even assuming that's true. Why'd they pick us? What're we, tasty treats or somethin'? - The building's gonna be demolished tomorrow. They kill us, they hide body. So anyone who comes through here will assume we left. The evidence gets buried. That's the big ol' boiler right there. They stuff us in there. No one will know, right? [brooding music] [wind blows] [radio bleeps] [interference screeches] [radio bleeps] [pipe clangs] [bones crack] [cannibal groans] [thuds] [flesh squelches] [thud] [body clunks] [whooshing] [flesh crunches] [flesh squelches] [sharp thuds] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] [flesh squelches] [whooshing] [flesh squelches] [somber music] - I know who she is. - What, baby? - [Girl] It's her. Isn't it, Grandma? - Quiet down, Jennifer. You don't need to be remembering such things. - You need to tell us something, Cammie? - Ma, what's she talking about? - You all remember that woman. She was attacked last winter in the basement. They killed her girlfriend. - Yeah, we remember her. - Nah, that can't be the same girl. - Yes. They raped her. - Fuck. So they did plan all this shit. - What did she say? "Vengeance is mine?" - No, no, no. She said "vengeance belongs to me." - She screamed for help, but we couldn't do anything. - So what, she's getting vengeance on us because we didn't do anything? We called the cops! - Yeah, it took 'em like 30 minutes to show up. We wanted to help. I wanted to. - Yes. I know, Stan. - She cried for help and we hid. And now we're paying for that. [brooding synth music] [radio bleeps] [tense synth music] [woman grunts] [flesh squelches] [whooshing] [bones crack] [heavy rapid thuds] [bones crack] - Find them! [whooshing] [rapid thuds] [thud] [whooshing] [thud] I remember you. [tense music] [woman grunts] [thud] [whooshing] [knife scrapes] [whooshing] [knife scrapes] [woman grunts] [thud] She's mine. [thud] [knife clacks] [soft thuds] [thud] [thuds] [bones crack] [heavy thuds] [thud] [whooshing] [sharp thud] [woman groans] [thud] [woman groans] [bones crack] [whooshing] [flesh squelches] [body clunks] She is the beast. [flesh squelches] She allies herself with Satan. And what have we learned from the Good Book? That there was only one way to kill the beast. [flesh squelches] [woman gasps] [tense music] You removed the head from the body. [flesh squelches] [thud] [woman groans] Stop her! [sharp thud] [body clunks] [woman gasps] Leave the bodies for now. To the basement. Restore the power. Let's finish what we came here to do. [door creaks] [door closes] [door creaks] [door closes] [brooding guitar music] [thud] [heavy thuds] [thuds] [thud] [Kay grunts] [thud] [thuds] [flesh squelches] [thud] [thud] [sharp thud] [flesh squelches] [groans] - Stay here, Jennifer. - Grandma, no. Don't leave me. [flesh squelches] [Cee groans] [thuds] [Stan grunts] - I won't be long. [Kay grunts] [thud] I'm sorry. I should've let Stan help you that night. It was my fault. [sharp thuds] [flesh squelches] Please. Don't hurt them anymore. - The Lord is good. - Yes. He is good. - When trouble comes, he is a strong refuge. [Kay gasps] [sharp thuds] [Kay yelps] - [Kay] No! No! - Hey, where'd you go, huh? You all right? Huh? [pants] [melancholy guitar music] - And he knows everyone who trusts in him. [flesh squelches] - No! - But he sweeps away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He pursues his foes into the darkness of the night. - Come on. - Get them. Save the man and daughter for me. [brooding guitar music] - Mommy won't be here very much longer, baby. You'll be the woman of the house now. I'll need you to take care of them. I need you to watch out for them. - We need you here. At least until your sister finishes high school. - High school? That's four more years! I have college offers now! - It'll be up to you to take my place. - This is a bad time. I'm overloaded with cases at work. You know, she relies on you. - You know, this isn't... It's not even fair. I have been taking care of you my entire life. And when do I get to live my life? When do I get to go out there and live my life? - Fine. Go, then. - I'll be back, Dad. It's just for a year. Hey, I'm home! Hey, dad? Sis? Hey, where are you guys? Who are you? - You let me down. - [sobs] Sorry, Mom. - [Leader] You care now, don't you? - Fuck you, you fuckin' dyke! - In God's eyes, we are all his children. [father groans] [flesh squelches] [distant sirens wail] [distorted radio chatter] [distant sirens wail] - She's lost a lot of blood. Combined with the head trauma, she's slipped into a coma. [brooding guitar music] [ominous tones] [heartbeat thuds] [brooding guitar music] [Kay yelps] - "Then I heard the Lord say to the..." [thud] [thuds] [thud] [Stan groans] [bones crack] [Stan groans] [thud] [Stan groans] [thud] [Stan groans] [thud] [Stan groans] "Then I heard the Lord say to the other men, 'follow him through the city and kill everyone. Show no mercy. Have no pity.'" - Run. Run. - "Then the Lord said, 'kill them all. Old and young. Girls and women. And little children.'" [suspenseful music] [door creaks] [sharp thud] - Get behind me! [thud] [flesh squelches] [thuds] [knife scrapes] [knife clacks] [thud] [bones crack] [grunts and thuds] - "Then shall two be in the field. The one shall be taken and the other left." [thuds] [groans] [thud] [thud] - Hey! Jennifer! Baby! Jennifer! [moody guitar music] [thuds] Jennifer! [thuds] [thuds] Baby! [thuds] [thud] [thuds] [thud] [woman grunts] [leader groans] [bones crack] [woman grunts] [bones crack] [woman grunts] [somber music] [bones crack] - [Woman] You don't have to do this. There's no deal unless you kill them. [grunts] [leader chuckles] - I will regroup. I will hunt down others. More will suffer like you have. [flesh squelches] [groans] - Come on, baby. Come on. [grunts] [door closes] [brooding guitar music] [eerie synth music]
