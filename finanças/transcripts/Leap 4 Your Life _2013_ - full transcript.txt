You think you got what it takes? I only take the best, because I am the best. If I hear whining complaining, excuses, you're out! I'm not your mommy, so don't come to me with complaints about being tired or it hurts too much, 'cause I'll just tell you toughen up and shut up! Am I clear? You weren't recording that, were you? Oh, good. Ok. Alright, girls, smile pretty for the camera. Good, yes. Amy, suck it in! Suck it in. Ok. Five, six, seven, eight. Hi, I'm Maureen. I'm the artistic director here at Sashay Dance Studio. Shoulders down. Suck it in. This is a little monument to Ms. M, me. I got this at nationals, and oh, this is my theatre debut in a chorus line. Oh, look at that. My portfolio from my modeling days. I don't know how that got in there, that's just crazy. Silly. Stand up straight! I am thrilled to announce that this will be the studio's 10th year in the Leap 4 Your Life competition, and there is not a doubt in my mind that we are going home with the grand prize! Sashay is most known for our fierce seniors. Thunder thighs! Keep going! This year, we have Hilary, who is definitely the star of my group. Hi, I'm Hilary and I'm in the senior company. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm the best dancer... but others have. I've been prepping all year for this competition. And I am just so proud of her. Her work ethic alone makes her a star. But I think her being the most talented dancer doesn't mean she is always the most popular, and that's ok. We're not here to make friends. My baby is gonna be a star one day. Stop talking, mom. Ok, sweetie. Next is Brooke who, unlike Hilary, has a natural dancer's body. But I've always said that if things come naturally to you, you never really want them that badly. Let's just say she's definite runner-up material. Hi, I'm Darcy. Oh, and this is my daughter, Brooke. Hi. And she's been with Ms. M for, what, four or five years now? But she definitely got the performing gene from me. ♪ We are kings and queens with golden dreams... ♪ Hey! Carrie Underwood! Zip it! My head hurts. Yeah, I just love being on stage and all the sparkly outfits and... Woah, woah, woah! Slow down there, lady. She's starting to sound like a stripper. And then there's our token male, Matt, who has those penis points for the judges. Hi, I'm Matt, I am the... male dancer of the company. I don't know why I put that in quotations. I'm Dan, I'm Matt's dad, and, well, this whole thing is kinda new to me, normally his mom brings him to all this but she's away this weekend on a girl's trip. You could say that. So I'm holding down the fort. But I'm very supportive of this guy right here and his choices, and I'm proud of everything he's accomplished and openly being who he is. I'm not gay, by the way. It's ok, son. I know. I'm really not. I just saw one of those dance shows and I thought it was pretty cool so I just thought I'd give it a shot, you know? Sure. Yeah, we'll go with that. And then there's Molly. Hi, I'm Molly and I'm a senior dancer here at Sashay, and this is my mom. Hi, I'm Danielle. I'm scared. I know, it's weird. Hi! She's been with me the longest, and um... well, she really just fills up space. If you know what I mean. It's my last year competing here, since I'm going to graduate and go to college, you know? Ok, listen up you guys. I've got your jazz costumes. That's for you, Brooke, Molly, Hilary, and Matt. These are cute. Oh, um, Ms. M? Yep. This is M/L. Yeah, I know. But I'm S/M, I'm the same as Brooke. In what world? Really? Watch that attitude, missy, because I saw you eat lunch. She's the most animated dancer here. Like, when she's on stage, you can not help but notice her. What's wrong, Molly? You got a yeast infection? Five, six, seven, eight. Ms. M even said I'm the anchor of the jazz group and that's why she put me in the back. What?! Yeah. She did?! Oh, that is so exciting! I'm so excited, I know! Oh, she's an anchor alright. Molly, I can still see you. A little to the right. Yeah, a little more. I can still see you. To the right. I guess you could say I have a reputation for being hard on my students. You got a keg in there? No. I want a six pack! They want me to be hard. And let me tell you, the dance world is hard. Believe me, all those tears are swept away once we clean out the competition. Oh, my seniors are fierce. Oh, they better be ready for us. I think what sets my daughter a cut above the rest, aside from her incredible flexibility and Christian sensibility, is her extensive training. Isn't that right, baby? Yes, mom. Well, I've been dancing since I was four. I've always wanted to be a ballet dancer, and I've trained in tap, jazz, broadway, contemporary and lyrical. I've done and won it all. This will just be another competition under my ballet belt. Sit straight and cross your ankles, dear. You look like a hooker. Well, you can jam it in your f... Can I call you back, mom? Who are you people? Um, daddy? This is my shot. Speaking of shots... Um, honey, why don't you introduce yourself? No, it's ok. God, I hate dance competition season. I mean, you think it's bad with that certain time of month, you know, with your lady friend? Well, times it by ten. And add f@ Ah, ah, ah. Oh, I just made some organic home-made blueberry muffins if you'd like. Not only is she a talented dancer, but she'll also make a wonderful trophy wife one day. This is my camera time, mom. Don't be a brat. Oh, love you, baby. Love you, too. Just shoot me. You know, people always ask me "what were the warning signs?". But my son never played with dolls. The funny thing is, ever since he was a little boy, the kid has been obsessed with balls. Yeah. All kinds of balls. Baseballs, basketballs, bouncy balls, balls, balls, balls. Never the sport, just the balls. Isn't that right, son? What? That's my boy. That is my boy. To be honest with you, I actually take a lot of offense, the term "warning signs", because there's a judgement in that. I love my son, whether he be gay, straight, or bi... lateral, the other one. I mean, he's my son, you know? I love him. I just want him to be happy. Not like my dad. He didn't care what your sexual preference was, he just hated you for you. I'm going to get groceries, does anybody want anything? Ow! Are you serious?! Dad! I'll get... I'll get the groceries, hon. My husband is an idiot. I've been sewing Molly's costumes ever since she was little. I just love it. And everyone's always so excited to see what I'm gonna wear. Yeah, I think it gives her the extra edge with the competition, too. Yeah, definitely. Can you pass me the scissors? Yep. I've been inspired with the 30's this year, and the whimsy of fringe! Yeah, I told my mom what I was thinking of wearing, but then we've been doing lots of sketches and, like, picking out fabric, and it's been a lot of fun. Oh, her solo is so amazing. She's just improved so much. Thanks, mom. I really want to wow the judges this year, and Ms. M. My mom and I are actually going to choreography my solo together because Ms. M said she was too busy, which totally makes sense. At first I was a little disappointed... Yeah, but then I told her that she wouldn't do that if she thought she couldn't handle it. And she can do it. Like, she doesn't let Hilary choreograph her own solo. That's saying a lot. I'm really hoping she's going to be impressed. Oh, there's no doubt. Especially with this costume. Yeah! Sweetie? Oh... uh, sorry. Honey, come. Come say hi. Uh, no. This is your moment. This is your moment. Come on. This is my dad! Say hi. Come on. Hi! He's a little shy. How are you? I'm John. You don't have to speak so loudly, dad. Hi, I'm uh... it's a pleasure to meet you. Keep speaking, like normal. Yeah, I pay for my own dance classes because money can be kinda tight for me and my mom, but you know what, I really like it, and the people here are really cool and they let me do open mic on Thursday night which is really fun. Uh, this is $2 Thank you, have a good day. ♪ The only question that I'm gonna ask is ♪ ♪ when did anybody learn, ♪ ♪ I must have turned around and blinked too fast ♪ ♪ to see that the grass turned green. ♪ Yeah, I think I've been dancing for, like, eight years now, but musical theatre is my favourite and I'm really excited for my solo this year because I'm doing an original piece that I wrote. Um, so it'll be cool. ♪ In these... ♪ ♪ what were you approximately take me to, ♪ ♪ baby you are from this far ♪ ♪ and I'll never give up when I get there. ♪ ♪ And if I never gave up when I get there. ♪ Thank you. Ok, drop the rope in the tent. Ok, assume the position. We came up with our own solution. It doesn't streak and it gets that glow-y look that is all the rage with the stars. Turn! My technique is flawless. Yeah, I am very excited about the upcoming Leap 4 Your Life competition, it's gonna be a full on guy's weekend, but with dancing, which is awesome. But anyway, I got us all stocked up on supplies here, I got some uh bacon for breakfast, we've got steak for dinner of course, and a little bit of beef jerky for a snack. Dad, I can't eat that stuff anymore, I'm a vegetarian. Told you. Oh, since when? Like, last week? Didn't get that memo. Well, that's ok, we don't need all this, we can... I'll make chili! Vegetarian chili. Who doesn't like that? Whatever. Really? Those are good. Oh, Dan. You got the wrong bread. It's white bread. It's for grilled cheese. Since when have we... we don't eat white bread. You don't listen, seriously. It's delicious, hon. I don't know why I let you out by yourself. Honey, it... ok... just a little thing we do, white bread games. Um... my dad is, you know, he's trying really hard, I just kinda wish he'd try a little less. I mean, I kinda feel bad for the guy. Dan and I were high-school sweethearts and then in senior year we got pregnant. And surprise! We had Matt. Getting married was the worst decision of my life. I don't think that she... likes me. I mean, sure. We love each other, I just think it's one of those things when I walk into a room I can feel her cringe. And that doesn't feel that awesome. So I've started seeing other people. We have an open relationship. An open relationship? No, we... that's... that's the first I've heard of that. We are just so honored to have you here and to celebrate our daughter with you. John here is leaving for Hawaii tomorrow. He's giving a speech. Yes, I have my annual meeting, but I'd much rather be here to see Molly on stage tomorrow. She literally lights up the stage. It's amazing. John here is a psychiatrist. Oh, and a great one! I don't usually like to lead with that because of all the preconceived notions. Freud and Oedipus Complex and all that is... Yuk. It's actually how they met! Tell the story. Danielle was bringing a friend to see me. Poor woman. She had a terrible phobia, didn't she? Doorways? Yeah. In fact, it was so bad I don't think I treated her because she couldn't make it from the waiting room to the office. Yeah, and it was only really a few steps. But there you were, my Danielle, just pushing her into my office. Oh, yeah. I was just pushing her! Ugh. It was so exhausting. That's when I knew. That's when I knew. Sensational, really. Aww. Excuse me! Can I get some service? Oh, Brooke, I didn't know you worked here. Uh, yeah you did. Don't be ridiculous, of course I knew you worked here, but I thought you were just two days a week. Oh, well normally I am but I had to cover some shifts, so... Oh, I'm sure, covered. So, how's your solo rehearsal going? Um, well I haven't really had a lot of time to rehearse with Ms. M because of work and stuff, so... Weird, I've been rehearsing non-stop, not to mention all the dance auditions I've been doing for ballet summer school. I'm thinking I might go to Europe to train once I'm done my volunteer work in Africa. Oh, well, wow, that is really cool. Anyways, enough about me, though it's so much fun to talk about. Aren't you going to ask me what I want? Oh, uh, yes. What would you- I'd like a medium, non-fat, half-sweet long Americano soy misto. Ok, and how about for your mom? She'll have a sparkling water. Ok. Oh, god. That is just not a good look. Should I get someone to clean that up? Oh, I guess you'd be that person, huh? Actually, don't bother. I'm a little grossed out. Just make that two sparkling waters. Thanks much. Alright. Mystery meat. Looks great. What happened to your lip? Ask your son. What happened to her lip? Well, it was just this little accident that happened- Pass the beans? Get the beans. Here. No, I'm good. So, Bill, how are you feeling? Constipated. What? She asked. How's it looking? Does it look okay? You can barely even tell. Really? Like, you wouldn't even... right? You wouldn't even notice. You look beautiful, mom. Yeah, you look great. It looks like you got stung by a bee. It doesn't. What? Thanks, dad. Oh, is that so terrible? Let's just eat. You look fantastic, sweetheart. Yeah, yeah. Don't touch me. So uh, dad, Matt's got his uh big dance competition tomorrow. That's exciting, huh? MMA is a competition. Dance is not a competition. Well, you should see the leaps coming from your grandson. Ok? Because if that's not athletic, I do not know what is. Matt, you got any girlfriends? Girls? Uh, well just with my school schedule and dance and everything, I haven't really had that much time. Dad, do you see what you're doing? Can't we just have a nice dinner? There is sort of one girl. He's got a girlfriend! He's got a girlfriend. We're trying to have a nice dinner here, dad. We're proud of Matt for who he is. What, I can't ask a question? I just want to know about my- It's not an issue. We get it out there... we're a family, I think we should be able to communicate openly- Oh yeah, you're doing a fine job of that. If you've got an issue with my son's sexual preference, dad. Dad, I'm not- Dad, I'm not gay! See? The house of lies that you've created. I knew you weren't gay, I've always known it. I- me too! It's racism, but towards gay people. It's gaycism. It's called homophobia, dad. It's called homophobia, dad. Gaycism. Is that even a word? Can I get a beer? We've seen you on beers, dad. What? Would you like me to go get you some? Matt, would you like a beer? Sure. Sure! There you go. Yeah? Beers all around! A man's drink. Yeah, it's a man's drink. Let's all get hammered and lie about who we are. That sounds great, dad. Do you want to hit him in the face, too, while we're at it? It's a bit of an unfortunate situation, but... I think his underwear is a bit too tight. ♪ I like to put everything into bags. I make lists because that way I just know that I have everything for tomorrow, and I've already made my lunch, I've already made my mom's lunch, and... Brookie baby, oh. Hi, boys. You're new. Honey, where's that cute little top that- Mom, what are you wearing? What? I'm wearing a towel. Loosen up. I swear to god sometimes, she is not my daughter. Where are you going? I, miss nosy-pants, have a hot date. Mom, my competition is early tomorrow morning. I know! Honey, I'm very excited to see your little dance thingy, and I know how important it is to you. So, I know. Why don't you put on Bridget Jones. And then when I get home at the end of the night I'll catch the tail end with you, ok? Promise? Promise. Now, help momma find a sexy outfit. Mom, this leopard shirt is- I love it, it's awesome. Mom, have you seen my good fishnets? Ugh, I can't sleep, I'm too nervous and excited. I keep double checking that I have everything. Mom! Have you checked your Ziploc? Found them! She always gets a little nervous the night before a competition. Sweetie, how are you doing? Ok, I want you to know that I am proud of you, and I want you to just go out there and have fun, ok? Ok. So let's go over your number one more time, and we'll call it a night. Ok. Ok? Ok. Five, six, seven, eight. Oh, hello. I mean, namaste. And welcome to my room. I like to meditate and visualize a win the night before a competition. It's something I've been doing since I was three years old. I also like to slip my slippers underneath my pillow every night. They're kind of my good-luck charm. Shh. Sweet dreams, I'll see you in the morning. ♪ My chemicals got you feeling like you're ready to blow, ♪ ♪ If I had a Maserati then we could ride it for sure. ♪ ♪ So fresh and so clean, Ms. Jackson's in control, ♪ ♪ grab your keys and let's go. ♪ ♪ Hands up and freakin', ♪ ♪ we're not gonna feel, ♪ ♪ no we're not gonna feel this alone. ♪ ♪ Hands up and freakin', ♪ ♪ we're not gonna feel, ♪ ♪ no we're not gonna feel this alone. ♪ ♪ Chic, baby. ♪ So, today started like any other day. My little Molly is still buzzing from last night. Yeah, I am just so excited, I look forward to this all year! I couldn't sleep at all last night. And it's tradition that we have pancakes on the day of the competition, too. Oh, it's ok mom, I'm not hungry. What's wrong, sweetie? I thought you loved my pancakes? I do, mom, it's just... Don't be ridiculous, sweetie. Carbs are good for energy. Don't tell Ms. M. These are my favourite, they're so good! Oh, fresh out of the oven? Tah-dah! They look so good. Just, like, one. Ok, one more. And maybe one more. Ok, that's good. Mom, we have to leave in ten minutes! Mom! So, uh... today is the big day, it's competition day. Katie is just about to leave for her girl's trip, so that'll be fun... Oh, is that her? Is that you going, hon? Love you! So she's off on her girl's trip, uh... but she left me a whole list of stuff to do to get ready, so... I'm supposed to iron Matt's shirt. Ok. Um, and then make sure that his dancer belt is in the dryer. Dancer belt... ok, we'll figure that out. But uh... I will start with the ironing. How do I turn this on? Ow! Heats up quick. Should be a fun day. Darling? Ready to go? Yes, mom. Everything's packed and it's in the car. Did you have breakfast? No. Excellent. She should be like any second. This is going to be so much fun! Oh, there she is! Hi! Shhhh! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Are you girls excited, or what? Yeah! Oh my god, will you stop with the yelling? Why does it smell like gasoline in here? Let's go! I'm going to throw up. I like driving with my mom. The other girls normally carpool, but, like, no. I like this time to relax before the competition. And I wouldn't want to cheapen my daughter's talent by having her ride in Danielle's car, so... And we're here, baby. Hi! It's Danielle, smile Hilary. Oh, I can't, it's broken. It's broken. I can't... yeah. Oh, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Ok. Yeah. Today is the official first day of the Leap 4 Your Life competition. I never get stressed on the day of because the work is already done. My team just has to hopefully deliver. It's out of my hands, now. Ok, so we have Hilary, Brooke, Molly, Matt... where's Matt? Where the hell is Matt? He was supposed to be here at 9 a.m., it is quarter after! Don't just stare, people, somebody call him! Ms. M! Ms. M! I'm so sorry I'm late, my dad, he said he totally forgot- I don't care what excuse there is. You can, and will, be replaced if it happens again. Do you understand? Hey Maureen, sorry, it's actually my fault, I forgot his little Sashay belt in the dryer. No, no, no. You will not keep me, or my dancers, waiting again. Is that clear? Uh, yeah. We're still, like, two hours early- Dad! ...before you start dancing, so... Step away from my dancers, please. I'm sure I can stay. You're dismissed. Beg your pardon? Go get dressed. All of you. Go! This is not ok. Move along. You know, I wrote the check, so if we're gonna be five minutes late, we're gonna be five minutes late. I like being prepared, and my students need those extra hours to get stage ready and warm up! There is no excuse for being late. Ever. Do what she does. That's it. Beautiful. Just do what she does. Oh, Laine. Good to see you. It's so fun to be back here with... Leap 4 Your Life. Maureen and I actually went to school together. She's uh... she's a funny girl. I don't think that's her real hair colour. Of course you know James? How could I forget? Hey guys! Awkward. I know. So James used to dance with Sashay but then he moved to Sparkle last year. Ms. M was pissed. Well, who can blame her? He totally went behind our backs. Totally. I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings, my family moved and Sparkle was just closer. Did they say anything to you guys? Well, we'll see you in there. As we win. Yeah, right. Get ready, now. Who was that? Sparkle Dance. Sparkle Dance? They don't seem very sportsmanly. No. Never-mind them. Their minds are gonna be blown with our new routines. Alright, team, let's win this! How do you even win at dancing? Big crowd out there, guys. Getting exciting. You're so talented. Aw, thanks mom. God, would you just... just move over a little. You can never over pack for these competitions. My make-up kit is like my baby. I guess you could say my mom and I are pro at this. With all the wins and practice we've gotten, why mess with a good thing? What's wrong with you?! I'm sorry, sweetie. We're fine. I've been up since 5:00 a.m. I always go for my morning run and do my full ab and bar routine to start the day. I even forget to eat breakfast sometimes. She has such discipline. I don't know where she got it from. Yes, there's a stigma of eating disorders or whatever you call them in the dance world. You won't find that in my dance studio. Nope. Ms. M has me on this no carb, no... well really it's a no nothing diet, and so far it's working. I am here to encourage my students to be healthier, which makes them feel good. And, to be honest, it makes my dancers look more attractive. Does that equal being thinner? Yes. But who doesn't want to be thinner? Sweetie? Do you need some help zipping up your costume? No, I'm not doing anything. Go away. Ok, I love you. Love you, too. Yeah, today was a rough morning. So Matt, your dad is pretty cute. Is he divorced? Dad, don't! It needs a little work, like a faux-hawk. Trust me. I know hair. Ok. I am uh... I am very excited about today, I even bought myself a new book to read, you know, while Matt's not performing. It's great, I mean, I've already scanned it, and it just talks about how we're all different and we should embrace that difference. And it's true, you know. I mean, I like hockey and beer and vagina. And he likes tutus, five o'clock shadow, and penis. So, that's awesome. I love it. And I think he should just go for it. I'm not gay. Uh, I mean, what other sport do you get to watch girls change and have them jump all over you? Oh, hey Matt, in my solo, I do this, you know, thing. Do you think this is too free? No, definitely not. Because I do this a lot, so... I know. Um, no, I don't think it's too much. No, it's not, hey? No. Actually, hey Matt, um... could you do me up? Uh, yeah. Sure. This is done up like a bra. Little clips. Have you seen one? What? Dancing is a pretty sweet deal if you ask me. Ok, team! I have a program. I am not responsible for your music, and I will not tolerate any screw ups so make sure you have your back-ups. Hilary, you are first in contemporary ballet. Brooke, fourth in musical theatre and Amy... Where's Amy? Here. Put your listening ears on! I will not say your name twice again. Understand me? You begin the junior solos in 45 minutes, so get dressed. And point those awful feet of yours. You look great. I hate teaching children, but her dad insisted. And, well, between you and me, he's paying way above the asking price for my choreography. There you go. I'm Julianna, I'm Amy's stepmom. Don't touch me. You know, it's just going to take us a little bit of time to get to know each other. And that's ok, I can wait. Right, sweetie? I'm serious. I'm going to tell my dad you hit me. She's just joking. I don't really know all the moms that well yet, I mean, Amy is in the junior dance company and so I don't really know the senior company moms that well but they all seem nice. I'm really excited about Leap 4 Your Life dance competition. I used to be a dancer myself. Yeah, I bet she was. No, no, no. Not that kind of dance. I was a ballerina. Well, I heard that she's Mr. Brown's third wife. His third. And we all know he didn't marry her for her brains. Ladies? Hi! Hi. I saved you a seat. Oh, that's fine. I'll just take this one here. That'd be great. Hi, I'm Dan. Julianna. Dan is quite nice. He's quite lovely.

What am I saying? I'm nervous, I'm on camera. It brings my wife and I very close. It keeps us motivated, educated, feeling things. Yes, Rexx and I have been married for ten years now. Isn't that, like, a conflict of interest? How so? Well, you're married. Uh huh. And you're the host. Yes. So doesn't that put her a step above? Give her an inside edge? Mmmhmm. I don't understand the question. Rexx? No, he seems like a great guy. He's like a combination of Liberace and Andre the Giant. Um... which is odd. Are you ready to see some great dancing? I can't hear you! Are you ready for some great dancing? Alright, let's get this party started. First up in our junior contemporary solos is... welcome to the stage Amy Brown, who's dedicating this song to her second mother, her new mom. That's sweet. Amy Brown! Sashay Dance Company. Alright, yeah! Woo! That little girl rocked. I wish more dances were like that. These things are always so boring. I even made a little tribute. It's still in progress. I'm Haydn and I'm Hilary's brother. Pretty sure I'm adopted. I'm pretty much involved because my mom forces me to be. Oh, my son. Yeah. Um, well Hilary and Haydn are actually twins. Haydn, he's a tough one. I think it must be really hard for Haydn to have such a talented sister. We actually have a family joke. We say that Hilary took all the talent genes in utero. Though, I'm starting to think that might be possible. It's the worst time of the year. I usually just draw to pass the time. In the old days, Degas paintings actually, ballet dancers were prostitutes. So, my sister is a whore. Essentially. That was genuinely amazing. Genuinely, that was amazing. She is so overrated. Unlike her, my daughter will make it as a dancer in the real world. Yeah, my mom wants me to pursue dancing, but I have this other passion. I really, really want to be a country singer. ♪ 'Cause I'm young, dumb, and having fun. ♪ ♪ Can't stop me now, I've just begun. ♪ ♪ Young, hot, which you don't got. ♪ ♪ Baby you can tell me but I'm probably gonna disagree. ♪ I love singing, I love being on stage performing, but my mom thinks that I should be more realistic, so... she's probably right. ♪ Tonight I've got some great big mistakes to make. ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm young, dumb, and having fun. ♪ ♪ I'm young, dumb, and having fun. ♪ ♪ Young, dumb, and I'm having fun. ♪ Hot!

Boom, jazz in your face! That was excellent. Now an interpretive piece from Molly. I think that went really well! There are no words to express what it feels like when you actually see your little girl up there dancing on the stage. It's just so beautiful. I almost threw up in my mouth. Well, that was very tribal. Ok, if you would like to grab a coffee or a doughnut, or go number one or two, now is the time. A five minute intermission. Have at 'er! Ladies! Hi. So? What did you think of Molly's dance? Oh, well, Molly was... good. Yes. I mean, her um... shoulder stand. I mean, wow. Oh, thank you! Oh, and Brooke and Hilary were phenomenal! Oh, thank you. Yes, well, not everyone can be as exceptional as Hilary. Ok, well we'll see you back in the theatre, ok? Ok, yeah. I'll save us some seats. Great. Ok. My god, what is wrong with those two? I do not know why they let her perform. Well, it's just one less person to compete with. That's what I say. Do you think she's slow, by chance? Oh, you're bad. Hi mom, can I have a pop? Hi. Here. And would you go out in the sun? Because you're pale. That boy's really filling out nicely. What a tramp. Wow. Have you ever seen a sweater that tight? It's disgusting, really. Five, six, seven, eight. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Sparkle Dance. Please. Laine may have stolen James, but her choreography is mediocre at best. It still doesn't keep me from being any less curious. Just what I thought, they had nothing on us. What I'm most excited about is Matt and Hilary's duo. That is gonna be killer. They just need to find the connection. If they do? Magic. Does that hurt? No. In a good way? No. Yeah, Ms. M really wants us to have a connection together but it's kind of hard because I think of Matt more as a girlfriend. But, you know, besides being a great dancer, I'm a really great actor. And I'll make it happen. She's hot. It'll be easy. Uh, do you want to try the opening bit? Yeah. Sure. One more time? Yeah. Ok, cool. That's good. You warm? I'm hot. Burning up in here. I was really worried about this number because I didn't want Matt to feel uncomfortable or judged by the other kids, but I took care of it. Matt, can I talk to you for a second? Uh, yeah. Thought you could use this. For what? Just trust me. Ok? I thought he just needed something visual to inspire him, hence the magazine, so I slid it his way and it actually had this neat thing. The centerfold thing was one of the vampire kids doing crunches, which is actually a great idea. Well, my daughter lives for a challenge, so she will bring it. Even if it means she has to sleep with him to get a connection, she will do it. Really? She said that? Alright. Who would like to see a double team? It's called a duo, you moron. A duo! Matt and Hilary, Sashay Dance Studio. It's really hard to dance with a large erection. It throws off your equilibrium, your jettes... He could actually even be an actor. Did you see their romantic connection? I mean, it's hard to fake that when you have absolutely zero chemistry with the other person and you find them actually physically unappealing. And he totally sold it. I gave him a handy before we went on stage. Should I get some of this sex off the floor? Based on these performances, I think we're gonna dominate in groups.

I swear, I know him from somewhere. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Lift up. Get her elevated. She likes that. You 18, right girl? I'm 16. Shit, ok. It just hit me. He was the stripper at my girlfriend's bachelorette party. Stripper, that's a terrible name for it. I'm a dancer. I'm a performer, you know? That's what I do. I dance around. People dance with clothes, I dance without 'em. There's a difference. Not big. It's big, but you know... can you cut that part? Well, that's not real dancing. It doesn't even count.

Yo, you killed it, y'all! Woo! Yeah, ha ha! Great job, guys. Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing when my mom's hitting on guys, 'cause it's not like she's subtle. Brooke's mom? Yeah, she's a total MILF. Ok, shh. We still have our contemporary jazz number to do, so go get changed and I'll check on you in a bit. Go. Go! Go! Good job. Like, I can't even bring a guy home because she always makes it into this weird competition, but she's the only one competing, if you know what I mean. And I know my mom's beautiful, I know she's a MILF. But sometimes I just wish that she was my mom. We can win this, we can win this, we can win this, we can win this... Sweetie? I had to move things around just a little bit, and your contemporary jazz routine is gonna be put first in the categories. What? No, that's like 15 minutes away, there isn't time. You can't do that! I'm sorry, sweetie, but Sparkle Dance... Sparkle my ass! Let me... Open up. Open up! No, no. I wasn't upset, I was frustrated at the unfortunate circumstance, but there was no other option. We had to go on earlier. I think you slipped at one point, though. No, I didn't. Yeah you did. You can't be good all the time. Ok, listen up! Listen up! They bumped up our dance, we're on in 15. What?! Yeah, yeah, yeah! There's no time for feeling sorry for ourselves, just get ready, hurry up. Dance your hearts out. Go. Go! Oh my god! Go! Ok, next up... Sashay Dance Studio! What? They're not supposed to be on yet. Put that away. Ladies and gentlemen, Sashay Dance Company, Boom! Just hit your heart center! We did it! Break a leg. Thanks. No, actually. Oh, suck it up. It is so sad how badly she wants to be me. Let's do this! Win! Ready? Ok! You can do this, right? Right! Right? Ok, energy! Don't mess this up. Go, go, win, win! Did you see my dance move?! That was so good! Shhh! Pack up your stuff, get ready for the results. I have a good feeling about this. Go, go, go! Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was a sparktacular way to wrap up this evening's competition. Next up will be the gala, so you've got an hour break. Take your time, freshen up, do what you must, but hurry on back because we'll be announcing the winners and the losers of Leap 4 Your Life. ♪ This is our story so far, this is my favourite part ♪ ♪ 'cause it's all down hill from here, ♪ ♪ yeah it's all down hill from here. ♪ ♪ We singin' hey, hey, hey... ♪ The gala is a very big deal. It's kind of like a second prom to many of these dancers. I think I'm going to be the most sad that I'm not gonna see my friends every day when we graduate from Sashay. Especially Hilary. Her and I are definitely besties. Eww. No! Molly just stares at me. It's creepy. So does her mom. Like, I get it, I'm beautiful and talented, but, like, close your mouth when you're looking at me, you know? I like your dress. It's ok, it's ok. Breathe. It's the same dress. She's fat. It really doesn't bother me, Hilary is the one that makes everything into a competition. And to be honest, I kinda think it looks better on me. She'll always be runner up, so just wait until I clean up at the awards. Actually, Hilary said we weren't dressing up for the gala, so I didn't. I would have dressed up too, but I like, I think this is more fancy. Like, 'cause they're low cut so... and I did the braid. It's ok. My mom says it looked good. You need to tighten your tie. I just told him that. I know. It looks better this way. Oh, honey, you're wearing my dress. Yeah. It's a little slutty. Just saying. You look great. Sashay Dance Company! Come, come, gather, gather. I just wanted to say I am proud of all of you, no matter what. And when they call your name, remember to cry and really act shocked so we really drive home the fact that we're humble. Oh, yeah. Yeah? Ok, good. Let's get out there and clean off that trophy table! Yeah! Yeah! Sashay Sashay Sashay! Woooo! And now, for the moment you've all been waiting for. The results! But first, let's give a big round of applause to all our amazing contestants for their hard work. Alright, shall we get down to business? I said, should we get down to business?! Drum roll please, dancers. And first up, in the category of junior contemporary solo is Liam from Sparkle Dance Co. Penis points, every time. Oooh, drama. No, we didn't win, but that's ok. She won in my books, didn't you, sweetie? My dad only married you for your boobs. Uh... First up, for senior contemporary ballet is... Hilary from Sashay Dance Studio. Her talent. You're all very lucky to get a chance to be in her midst. Best duo goes to... Hilary and Matt from Sashay Dance Studio for Inception! What'd I tell you? I'm proud of him. When I was a kid, I told my dad I wanted to be a hockey player and he told me that'll never happen. You're too small, you're uncoordinated, and you're too much of a wimp. Then he punched me in the face and I started to cry. He said "See? You can't cry in hockey, wimp." Ooh, the tension is palatable. Up next, my favourite award, best personality, goes to... Molly from Sashay Dance Company! Woooo! Ok, that's an excited mother. And now she's on stage. We discourage this everyone... It's so in our hearts, you know? Because she's so meant to do this, she's so talented. The moms are on the stage. Ok, that was a little enthusiasm. I would have gone with it... Ok. It was a pity prize. Now, let's move onto groups. For best hip hop, we seem to have a disqualification. It appears that Sashay Dance Studio is disqualified on the grounds of age inappropriateness. What?! Yeah, I wasn't too surprised about that one. So, by default, the winner is Sparkle Dance Co. We won! I'm not gonna lie, I was really scared there. They were doing moves I'd never seen before. Like, I don't think I'd be allowed to. It's unbelievable, I have never heard of that before. But I told Maureen not to do hip hop. I said our dancers are serious contemporary dancers, not video hoochies. Would she listen? No. So there you go. Oh my... are you...? Don't get too upset or your Spanx might break. Listen up, thunder thighs, your cheap box steps might work with these simple-minded judges, but they aren't going to take my chances at my trophy. Got it? Look at them. I won. Me. Your breasts just touched me, I don't like that. Your breath stinks. Your hair smells good, though. I know. I love it. What is that? And now, can someone bring out the ultimate grand supreme trophy? Oh, there it is. I'm just gonna go to the washroom. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The winner of the ultimate grand supreme trophy and $100 gift certificate to the Olive Garden... I love those cheese buns. Is... Sashay Dance Studio! Yes! Yes! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, can you believe this? Sashay Dance Company has won the grand prize a consecutive ten years in a row, which is basically unheard of. Yes! Yes! Honey, I love you. Thank you for all your efforts. This is Rexx, with two x's, singing off from the tenth annual Leap 4 Your Life competition, I looked at all of you in the eye at some point tonight, you're all lovely. Let's connect soon again. Until next year, keep it snappy. Where's my mom? What? They won? I didn't know. A lot has happened since the Leap 4 Your Life competition. Um... Matt's mom and I officially separated. Um, so that's been a bit tough, but it's for the best. She's much happier with her new guy, so that's... and we're friends. We're still friends, you know, as much as you can be while feeling completely demasculinized. But you know, it was actually Matt who convinced me to get out there and start dating again, and I was kind of nervous and skeptical, but it turns out I met someone, and she's kind of special. I mean, we're just, you know, we're taking it slow, but it's exciting. And for the first time in a long time I'm happy. Yes, Mr. Brown and I did break up, but that's ok because Dan has been so amazing. And so positive. Especially with everything going on with Matt. And also he's a really good kisser. My dad has just been incredibly supportive. As soon as he found out that Hilary and I were expecting, he insisted that we move into the basement rent free. It's been incredible. Hey, sweetie. Especially since we found out we were having twins! That was a shocker, hey? I hate you. That's just a little joke that we have. We go back and forth. I hate you, I love you, I hate you, I love you. No. It's just like pet names. Hey, buddy. She's just a little tired. The babies wake up every hour, so... Hey honey, show them the ring. Show them the ring. Yeah, I had to quit dancing and get a real job to support Hilary and the little family, but I love landscaping. It's awesome. To be out in the sunshine, sweatin', getting dirty with the boys, you know. My dad's still on this whole gay thing though, it's ridiculous. I guess I just don't have the heart to tell him that I'm straight. I guess I don't want to disappoint him or something. Look at those chatty Cathys. People make mistakes. You learn from them. Right? Matt did, you know? He got Hilary pregnant. Do I love him any less? Absolutely not. In fact, there's just a lot more to love. Right fellas? Yeah, and you know what? It's helped me make some new friends. I joined a group, grandpas under 40. We get together and have a great time, don't we? Look at this, we've got our own little team going here. They're so tiny! They're like little footballs, you know? Just huck 'em over, go long! No, I wouldn't. I was just joking. I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't throw a child. He's like "You've got no nipples, I'm hungry. Where's mommy?". I don't know where she is, so we're just hanging out. Yeah, I'm not dancing anymore. Since I'm fat now and I have these demon babies. Apparently being a twin increases your chances of having twins. It's like mother nature's sick joke. I don't even want to be living here, but my mother has completely disowned me so whatever. Oh, no I don't have a daughter. My daughter would never get herself knocked up by some fairy and then throw away her entire dance career just because she didn't realize you have to keep your food down for birth control to work. No. I do have a brilliant artist of a son. He just feels things on such a deep level, it comes across in his work. He's having a gallery show soon and I know it will be brilliant. I'm just so proud of him. Stop talking, mom. Ok, dear. Oh, I know. I heard about Hilary. Karma. Anyways, things have been going really, really well with me. I moved to Nashville to live with my dad and I entered this singing competition just on a whim and I won. I landed a record deal, and I'm now recording my first album. I'm doing all of these interviews, all of these concerts, and my first single is on the radio. This is all a dream come true for me. Hey, did my mom call by any chance? No, sorry sweetie. Anyways, I have to go, I have a sound check right away and I'm opening up for Carrie Underwood, so wish me luck! Or, no. Break a leg. Still getting used to all this. Yo, yo, LL Smooth Moves here. Check it man, we got some big things to talk about, besides this hottie to my left. Uh, to your right. Right. Hi, I'm sure you've all heard about LL's internet success, he's the latest online rapper sensation. Look, I'm not making any money off these videos yet, but uh... never say never. Right beebs? Well, you know, now I'm his manager and producer and things are going great. I mean, I know talent when I hear it. Even if it meant re-mortgaging my house. I'll pay you back. Yes. And now we're living the dream, baby, here in Florida. Yeah, we had to move due to legal complications. We don't have to talk about that. Yeah, we do have to talk about it. The truth must come out. They blew this whole thing out of the water, man. They don't understand my process, you know what I'm sayin'? When you teachin' someone a robot, I have to get on top of you? I made bubbles. Hi, it's great to see you again. This is Sammy. Sammy, say hi! It's been quite the busy 12 months, actually. Yeah, as you know Molly got her braces off. Ok, Molly. I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah. I see that your breasts are coming in. So that, and getting your braces off, will make you very popular with the boys. Let's have a look. Ok. Huh. That's weird. They should have come off a year ago. Oh, it's so hard to watch your baby grow up. I just thought she looked so cute with her braces on. Ow, that really hurt. They feel so weird. Yeah, look out boys, here comes Molly. I feel so free. We're very sad to see her go away to university. I just channelled all that negative energy, and, well, I just started teaching kids dance at Ms. M's studio. It isn't much, but it's amazing. I'm all about building self-esteem and having fun, and oh, the kids just love it and I feel so alive and I'm just so happy. And without Molly being here, well, we don't have to lock the door anymore. Yeah, things have been going great since Leap. I was really nervous about moving away but I really think it's been for the best. I mean, at first I was feeling kinda down about not having that solid group of friends anymore, but then I found out about the sororities here and honestly it's been awesome. Like, the girls are just so nice and it's like having one big sleep over. Molly! Oh, hey! M-town. What? Nothing. Molly, how's it going? Good. Just going to class. Oh cool, me too. I'll walk with you. Yeah. But first I would like to ask you a question. Sure. I was wondering, later, if you weren't... busy, we could grab a bite to eat? Or a bite to drink, or something? Uh, yeah! Yeah, I would love that. Awesome, cool, great! Cool. Yeah. Awesome. Let's uh, go to class. Cool. It's a bee. I'm allergic. Oh, no. A lot has happened since last year's Leap 4 Your Life. Lots of press and new students. All kinds of amazing opportunities coming in for my dancers. I can't go into detail about everything because of legal mumbo jumbo, but... Broadway. It's exciting, and things are going wonderfully indeed. Indeed. I do, I do have to... you're in my space. I have to say that I am really proud of everything that I have accomplished. We. We have accomplished. Together. No, it's definitely me. Tomato tomato. Can of soup. I hate you. If you aren't nice to me I'm going to smash the shit out of your curling iron. And I'm serious. Effing serious this time. Cricket, cricket. Never-mind that, I'm busy again getting ready for the eleventh annual Leap 4 Your Life competition, and this year I have some crazy talent in my senior company. Max! Eyes forward. They're gonna be fierce. Oh yeah. Five, six, seven, eight.
