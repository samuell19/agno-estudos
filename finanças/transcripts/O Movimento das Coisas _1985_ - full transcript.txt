THE MOVEMENT OF THINGS Good morning. Good morning, Isabel. Let's go girls. Maria, Alice, Dulce... it's time you were off. Eat slowly. With your mouth, that's right. Do you want some more, Tive? Oh aunt Fina! What do you want? We're off to the country. I'm going later. Hello, Joaquim, are you hungry? - You bet. - Have a spot of soup then. - Good morning. - Hello father Manuel. Soup I see, enjoy it. Have a nice meal! See you soon. Let's go boys. I'll take it. I'll take it. Good afternoon, mother. Hello. You've arrived then? Yes. I'm going to change. You've arrived yet? We went up there and stayed a bit too long, as usual. It's cold up there? I'm going to put the machine away. Tired, Domingues? Somebody work's up there all day they have an apple in the afternoon, they shouldn't be hungry... Instead of taking one apple, take two. I haven't got time to eat one, let alone two. They don't even give you time to eat. Good night then.. What time do you call this then? Well, I was chatting with my brother over by the pump, reading the paper, seeing what's going on about the country. And us here waiting for you. So you started eating. That's what we did. And now I'm going to eat. But it's all cold. That's my problem. Yesterday I starved but today I'm going to eat, it depends wether it's cold or hot. Are you going? It's time I was off. There he goes. Never around here. What do you want then? And then of course any problems and his mother and father have to put up with it. It's allways the way, if it was a working day he wouldn't go tomorrow. The he goes until god knows what time. When you were younger you went too. I only went two or three times, they didn't let me go like that did they? You did what you could. When I could, but I didn't go any old how like they do now. Freedom is like that, what can you do? Right, let's have this hot soup, see if it does some good. It's good, It's good woman. If I'd eaten like this yesterday it would've been better. Good night. Hou much is that? That little nightshirt with the bows in the middle, it's nice isn't it? Look at the little girl's head. It's ready. I don't know if there's anything back. After it's going from that other side as well. Behind the bucket, put it beside that one. Well good morning, you're going to buy a lot today? And you've got a lot to sell me? That's right, sheets, blankets, these are very nice for a wedding. But I'm not getting married yet and then I might find some prettier ones. But you've got to buy them before you get married. How much is this one then? Thirteen hundred. OK. Is that all then? Nothing else? No, just this for today, but you could give me a discount. I can't, thirteen hundred is thirteen hundred. You never can, can you? Do you want it wrapped up or will a piece of string? String's OK. You, dear Lord are truly holy, bless these gifts, shedding your blood that they may be converted for us into the body and blood of J.C.O.L., who when he gave himself up voluntarily to suffer death took of the bread and giving thanks did break it and give it to his disciples saying eat and drink, for this is my body... Eat and drink for this is the chalice of my blood blood of the noble and eternal alliance split for you and all the men to redeem your sins, it is in my memory. Herein lies the mystery of faith! ... the bread of life and the chalice of salvation. Oh my Lord, my king. You are true to your word and perfect in all your works. You are good to those who falter and you lift up the oppressed. Thy name be praised for ever, oh Lord. Oh my Lord, my king. I wish to exalt my God and my king and forever praise Thy name. The bitter song of complete solitude, come and sing, dream in your song, live dreaming of a new dawn in which men will once again become brothers. Don't you wan't any soup, Ricardo? Help him. Isn't the spoon there?
