Billa here Billa why are you looking stright, look at the right. Brother.. We have seized all the dens of Aslam and Billa. All his business and his men are under our control. Chamunda brothers have made a name, brother. Entire Mumbai shudders at the sight of these brothers. The best thing will be when Aslam and Billa's right hand.. ..Bhushan will be in our control. - What is the use brother? - He is a golden goose. By confining him we can find out about the.. ..billions of dollar deal that Aslam was going to do after two days. But brothers in a short time to get him out of the police custody ..is not only difficult, but is impossible. Chhagan. On this earth the history.. ..always repeats itself. Just go through the pages of history, you will get the story. - Inspector Shinde. - Yes sir. - Is everything alright? - Yes sir. - All arrangements are done? - Yes sir. Alright sir...tomorrow at 7:30am sharp. - Father please save me! - Ajay! Please save me father! - Welcome minister. Thanks a lot for handing over Bhushan to me. Leave my son! We will surely leave him but after the task is over. Did you forget that according to your promise you have us get across the border? I know it..that is why I got the car along. Very good. Whoever you are.. ..just remember that you cannot play with the law time and again. Minister such is our relation with the law. By arresting Bhushan the law had made us helpless. And to free him, we have made the law powerless. Please hand over my son. What is the hurry minister? Till such time.. ..we all don't cross the border.. ..you and your son shall be in our custody. Are you alright? - Yes papa. Inspector Arjun. Valorous people like you are the strength of the law. Keep the good work. - Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Brother.. I'm very sorry to hear about Jagan's death. I'am also very sad. But the inspector who killed him is alive yet. He will also died brother. To live and die is the doctrine of our business. But the regret is only of one thing. We still haven't got hold of.. .. that rascal Bhushan for whom Jagan gave up his life. Bushan was one of your enemies. Yes he was, but we caught him alive.. ..then it would have been very beneficial for us. Because he wasn't a man but a Gold mine. But that inspector ruined our entire plan. Brother if you say the that inspector.. - No. ..not yet. This is not the time. It is the guideline of our business that.. ..keep doing your work silently. And hide yourself from all, as far as possible. To raise a hand on a police man means.. ..to come into the limelight. To kill him we will have to wait for the right time.. ..and the right opportunity. But brother.. - Chhagan is right. My I come sir? - Come in. There is an important message for you,.. ..the dreaded terrorist Bhaktawar Singh.. ..has escaped from the jail along with his accomplice. What? Bhaktawar has escaped? -Yes sir. Just 2 days before after a dangerous encounter Bhishma,.. ..had arrested him on the border. Commander Shakti Singh. Where is Bhishma? The humanity cannot be wiped out even if the man is. No matter what strategies are planned by the devils. So says this earth and so does the sky.. The savior of righteousness is the greatest. Whenever the Satanic rule will encourage.. ..injustice and inmorality. And then will arrive the destroyers ot he evil. And this is a challenge. Bhaktawar..Jagawar has helped you evade the arrest. You would have barely managed to make two ends meet.. ..even if you served for you entire life. This reward of Bhaktawar filthy rich sepoy. You haven't done a great favor by giving this money. Bhaktawar..don't waste your time in these useless talks.. Hereafter also you might require me. Hey you, I give money and get my work done. If not you then some other colleague of yours will do. Bhaktawar! Attention everybody. Put of the fire. Throw the lights. Boys..Fire. Bhishma? I made a mistake. Please forgive me. You keep this but please leave me. Inspector Jagawar.. looking at your face. Today Bhishma hates both the law and the protectors of the law. I don't want to hear any of your explanations Bhishma. Sir I..- Do you know how many blunders you've made? The first mistake.. ..that without the orders of the Platoon commander of the reigment.. ..you started off to finish Bhaktawar and his gang. If I waited for the orders then I'd have lost one day of leave. Second mistake was that you shot at, inspector Jagawar. Sir, that inspector had helped Bhaktawar to escape. Shut up! - He was bribed by Bhaktawar. Just shut up! By killing a security officer you have become a murderer Bhishma. If a protector of the nation kills a traitor and is the branded as a criminal.. ... then I do no respect such a law. Even if I had got him alive to you ..then your lethargic legal laws would have tried him.. ..for years and would have acquitted him as an innocent. Then you are suspended. For two months. I do not mind sir. And you can go now. -Thank you very much. Major, you had been asked to report, what is the matter? Nothing just that my one month's leave has been extended to two months. Now I will coolly go to my village and enjoy my mother's cooking. And have fun with my two brothers. Oh no Bahadur Singh, this girl is in a bad shape. She should be reached to the hospital, come on. Sister,...please do not worry. I will take you to the hospital..come. Come..take it easy. - My neck. - Come on out with your purse. I'm a sepoy.- Keep it to your police station. Remove your purse. - I will remove it, wait. This has my salary of the month...oh my neck. It's a hand or a hammer! Take this baby. Oh my neck. She has taken my entire salary and given me this. Tea, sir. - Hasmukh Singh.. Where is Barood Singh? - Sir.. He comes late as usual. Where is the comissioner's file? - He knows it sir. Has he ever given anything. Just go away from here. When Barood Singh comes, send him to me. I'm watching since long that you are pampering him. Please have the tea, else it will become cold. Barood Singh reporting, Sir. So you are here? You go. What happened? I was walking.. ..now its not a fault of a tree falling. Yes what is the fault of the tree,.. ..the fault is of your neck that it came under it. - Yes sir. Now will you do one favor? Will you get commissioner's file? - Yes, sir. Then go. - Yes sir. Hall?! Today night there's a New year Party in the hotel Blue park. Where there is a drug deal that is going to take place.. ..with one Mr. Robert who's come from Hong Kong.. ..through which you can catch many big drug dealers. Hall?! Hall?! "We are crazy, why are you scared of the crazy." "If we have to then lets love each other my friend. "What if any one obstructs us or any one stops us." "Let us acquaint ourselves to each other." "Just hear what this heart says." "Now come into my arms." "How can I agree to you." "Any thing can happen anytime." "I fear this big bad world." "And I also fear a crazy being like you." "We are crazy now why fear the crazy?" "Love as much as you want we are ready." "We are crazy now why fear the crazy?" "Love as much as you want we are ready." "What if any one obstructs us or any one stops us." "Let us acquaint ourselves to each other." Robert hand me over that box of drugs. Search him. Sir,..Nothing is found on him. Sir, I have understood where the box is. Where? Excuse me! See, that lane is very dark.. ..can you drop me to the end? Thank you. I'm very scared of darkness. Don't you feel.. ..that these dark lanes should have more lights? Like this. Remove the money from your pocket and hand it over. What if I don't? - Then I will tear my clothes. Then? - Then I will shout loudly. Then-Then I will yell and gather a crowd. And that crowd will beat you up. Then? After that police will come Come on hurry up, handover to me. No I will have to. You are a real great item. What connection do you - I don't know any Robert. You are lying. - No, I'm telling the truth. Where did you deliver the box? Which box? The one which was given to you by Robert in the New Year party. No one had given me that box, but I stole in thinking.. ..I'll get some money inside. But..then I throw it in the gutter. Sir, agreed that I'm a petty thief.. ..but I have never allowed anyone to touch me. Looks like you will believe me when I kill myself. What is this nonsense? If only someone had slapped me like this long before. Then probably I wouldn't be picking pockets on the streets. Sir, whatever I told you till now is the truth. If I was working with someone like Robert.. ..then you wouldn't find me in these dark lanes.. ..but some fantastic hotel or a bungalow. See you.. .. leave this small time robbery and.. ..get married to some good person and.. ..and settle down. Will you marry me? Will you settle down with me? So..are you shaken sir? It's very easy to say.. ..but difficult to do. Barood Singh do one thing. - Yes. Leave this girl and give her this money. Give her this too. Give it me. - Hey you bald fellow stop it. You will get suffocated. No child don't cry. Seema! What happened? - I told you not to do it? Bunty.. I told you not to. See my shirt is soiled. Seema! Suraj...when did you come? I came when my loving brother was scolding his son Bunty for wetting his shirt.. .. and was calling out to Seema. Brother.. Who is this Seema? I don't know of any Seema. You are hiding it from then your brother owns a truck. And he has traveled a lot. Now don't hide it from me. Tell me fast Told you I don't know Seema. But tell me what business are you doing? Of transport. How's the business doing? I'll tell you..first take this sweet. Brother.. I have got a very large contract of poultry.. ..to supply eggs. - Very good! I want you to work very hard and.. ..excel in the business of transport. Come on get fresh ..lets eat food and.. ..tomorrow we have to go to our village. Who's here so late in the night? I'll see. - Just see. You refresh yourself. I... - Are you Seema? How do you know? - I not only know you.. ..but also your kids and your husband too. Meaning..- Have you gone mad? Please don't believe him he is mad and talk rubbish. Please come inside. - No I must get back.. ..I just came to return your money. You believed me and made me realize my mistakes.. ..that is enough for me. And yes. ..you manage to scare girls by drinking ale. I'll tell you something, I was really scared for a while. Brother, you said you don't know any Seema? You shut up. - Okay I'll tell her.. ..that you got married to her and kids.. Seema..please listen to me. What rubbish are you talking? Not rubbish but connecting your line. Is this the way to connect a line? Go from here. This person is a truck owner. And he himself is the driver. I have given him a contract of supplying eggs at my farm. Where we supply drugs through the eggs. When you have given a contract the chap must be good. We have many of our own trucks.. ..and many drivers too. Then why do we need him? No, we do, because this Suraj is the younger.. ..brother of Inpector Arjun. "We all are crazy people." "Nobody can recognize us. "We have come here to entertain everybody." "In an ecstatic mood we sing songs of love." "Hey madam, mister listen." "The group of friends are going in a buoyant mood." "On this shining path," "The group of friends are going in a buoyant mood." "On this shining path," "Hey listen you fair girl." "We have come to this town." "Its our age for fun and frolic." "Neither we have worries nor any fear." "Its our age for fun and frolic." "Neither we have worries nor any fear." "Lets have some frolic and get some money. "It will be great fun." "We all are crazy here." I feel very happy when all my 3 sons are with me. Brother why don't we all stay together in the city? We sell off all this land and lead a peaceful life. Idiots are like you, who sell off the ancestral property.. ..and live a life in a strange city. I'll die but, but never sell off my ancestral property. You say you never get angry on your younger brother. I just joked and you just pounced on me. Never make a joke like this ever. Bhishma! Sir!...Sir! What is it? - Sir.. ..I hope not you too. Did you have also it? - Yes sir. Once I fell in love with a girl from Kolhapur. Sir...She asked me to meet. What did I know that her father was a wrestler.. ..he lifted me 3 times and dropped me.. ..and the fourth time he said.. ..that I will bury you here itself. Barood Singh reporting sir. Sir, I will go. But do you remember what I said? Yes, please go. - Thank you sir. What is the time? - It's 12. 12 o'clock - Yes sir. Is this police station or a theater? Sir, some one gave you this letter. Sir..when the person loses sleep in the night.. ..and so also the peace of mind. Which means that she is in love. Same are my feelings for you. If you have a little sentiment for me. Then come to meet me at Banjara Hills at 4pm. Seema. The loss of sleep and peace of mind means one is in love. And same are my feelings for you. If you love me.. "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "You are my life and my desire." "You are in my heart." "You are my life and my desire." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "Agreed my sweethart you are cross with me." "But listen to what my heart has to say." "Your heart is agreeing." "But your lips say a no." "I liked your style." "There are many beautiful girls." "But for me only you are the one." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "Agreed my sweetheart you made a mistake." "And this was one of my styles." "How can exist getting angry on you." "I won't be able to live away from you." "My entire prestige is in your care." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "You are my life and my desire." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." "You are in my heart." Come on load the goods fast. I don't have time. Come on uncle..don't be lazy enter my name. Hey I'm doing your work. I hope you won't make me sit here whole day. Let me do my work. -I don't have time. I have to go to meet my brother. And tell me where have I to deliver the goods. Same to Chandni Chowk. Powder.. Powder.. So what, you are working since so long haven't you seen? Are you blind? Take it. That I will surely but, to the police station. Stop that scoundrel. Don't let him go. Wait,..don't kill him. He will die...but that time.. ..when he will be beneficial for us by his death. How can his death be beneficial to us? Its a very old story Madan. There was a village surrounded by thick forests. In that jungle two dogs had created terror instead of tigers. The dwellers of that village were scared of passing through the jungle. Once..there came a clever hunter in that village.. ..he came to know about the terror of those dogs. The hunter was unarmed and set of with a dry bone. As soon as the dogs came in front of him.. ..he threw that dry bone in between the two. After that..the bone broke all the relations between the two of them. We understood brother. Now go and search that other dog Bhishma.. ..and the dry bone is here with you. Here comes the rogue who can turn to a lie.. ..and also a lie into a truth. What is he doing in our village? Listen.. -Hey you city dweller. You come here, as you I will not come to you. What is it? Can you tell me where does Bhishma stay? Who are you? - I'm a friend. At this time he is not at home. He will be in the godown.. at the end of the lane.. ..on the backside is the godown. Thank you. What is this man doing in the village? Mangal Singh...horse from Kathiawad.. ..there is something fishy. Bhishma...- Who is it? Who is remembering me early in the morning? Is your name Bhishma? There vill be many....in this world. I'm that Bhishma who is identified by Suraj and Arjun. Then I'm in the correct place. Arjun sent me. Arjun sent you, then why didn't you tell me? Why are you standing out. Come and sit here. How are Arjun and Suraj, are they allright? They are not okay. That is why I had to come here. Don't talk in riddles, tell me soon what happened? Are they in trouble? - Looks like you are naive. That is why I have my sympathy with you. I don't have courage to relate what I'm.. ..going to looking at your innocence. But what to do my profession do it. If you talk in riddles I will break your head. Tell me what is the matter? Arjun has asked his share of from the ancestral property. Scoundrel..are you drunk? You lawyer dare you talk this about my brother! The sun my rise in the west but my Arjun can never do such a thing. My brother cannot act so demeaning. You are lying. - What is the need for me too? My profession is law. If you don't pay heed to my request then.. ..he will have to go to court. What rubbish are you talking about my brother? You scoundrel. You won't agree till I pull out your tongue. Then do it! - Stop it you two. I'm just acting on his behalf he has sent me here as a lawyer. What do I know about the feud between you two brothers. If you don't believe it then see. Look at this.. .. this is the summon. And here is the notice. Hold it. Mangal Singh this is right opportunity. A step brother remain a stepbrother after all. He is my flesh and blood my own. Whom should I tell, that my son is a defector? Probably the fault lies with me. Hey you city dweller... with Bhishma? You said that Bhishma is your friend. How did this turn into an enmity? What have you got to do? - I have it.. The willage dweller Mangal Singh.. ..One piece horse from Kathiawad, So what can I do? I haven't unterstood one thing.. Arjun who was devoted to his brother Bhishma.. ..has changed or has been changed. What do you know about Arjun? I know him very well. Both respect me a lot. I have to avenge an old deal with Bhishma. Sir, if you get togheter with me.. ..then Bhishma can be ruined. - How is that? - Look here.. ..Bhishma thinks of me as his friend.. ..then I'll take advantage of that friendship. What are you trying to say? Sir..its an era of inflation.. ..and by becoming a traitor On can gain a lot of prosperity. Then it is not termed as betrayal. Understand? You look like a gunk but are a clever plotter. This is what I wanted to make you understand. I'm that even an ant can. ..make a biggest elephant fall on the ground. Come with me. Oh my God...Mangal Singh.. ..you have come to the right place. Looks like your luck is shining upon you. I have come to Mumbai many times.. ..but never seen such a extravaganza. This is a theatrics. So he is that sample. -Hey sir.. I'm not a sample... But mangal Singh. One piece horse from Kathiawad. Madan..have you explained to him what he has to do? I understand everything.. you mean that.. ..I have destroy the entire family in one shot. Then think that the family is destroyed. Think it once again Mangal. On one hand is the intelligent Arjun and.. ..on other hand is the iron man Bhishma What is there to think? So what if Arjun is a police officer.. ..I have seen him growing since childhood.. Only Bhishma is the one who has the real wealth.. If it wasn't for the that. The he wouldn't have been anywhere near me. Now that Bhishma will know. What is Mangal. Mangal Singh? - Yes, I went to your.. ..police station..there I came to know you are at home.. ..so I come here. What is the matter? You come and have your food,.. ..or else after hearing me you will not be able to eat. What happened? What all hasn't. You are such a big police officer, but very naive. You are such a big police officer, but very naive. ..but now my conscience has dragged me here. I don't want that you should.. What happened to Bhishma? Where is your brother Bhishma.. He used to lavish affection on you and your brother. But for the property he has changed his stance. - Mangal! You don't know Arjun.. ..this greed for property is such. Once that greed enter ones mind.. ..then that breaks all the relations. And as it is Bhishma is not your real brother. After all he is a step brother. By calling Bhishma a stepbrother, you have managed to break ..all old relations now if you utter one more word.. ..the I'll break you to pieces. Beat me as much as you like. I came to you thinking of you as my close kin.. ..go and save your brother Suraj. What happened to Suraj? Tell me the truth. The division of property is there is every house. But no brother snatches any brother's share. I have heard Bhishma saying that.. ..that he will kill Suraj. But will not part with the third share of the property. I'm telling you that he will ruin you both. You both are step brothers. You are talking about the share to Arjun.. ..you scoundrel. I know Arjun very well.. Get out of here. Dare you come here with your rotten tongue.. ..You donkey from Kathiawad. Arjun is not only my brother but my life he is the light of my house. What of property..I can give my life for him. I knew it, that truth will thing Bhishma ..many times light of the house can put the house afire. My name is Mangal Singh ..from Kathiawad I'll see you. Water. It is your bad luck that you are the younger brother ..of inspector Arjun who killed my brother Chhagan. After dying today when go to God tell him.. ..never to make you Arjun's brother in any of your rebirths. Or else you will get killed by Chamunda every time like this. Very good....Mangal Singh. Horse from Kathiawad. In my childhood my mother told me that an astrologer.. ..predicted that I have a astrologer right? Yes, Mangal Singh. The astrologer was right. But one of your job is still remaining Mangal Singh. That will also be done. Why are you worried when I'm there. Let me enjoy this royal treatment. That you have to for your entire life. Mangal. First do this job. Hey you.. if anyone disturbs me while eating.. ..then I don't like it. Now this is an important job hence I will do, understand. Hello.. - This is Mangal Singh. Yes Mangal, struck.. Everything ruined, I told you .. ...before that Bhishma has gone crazy. If you want to save your brother then.. ..go to the garde of Danapur and see him. Over..your job is done. Now let me eat. Yes. No Mangal...another small job is left as yet. Surely the astrologer told your mother that you have royal fortune ... in your luck. But he forgot to tell you mother probably.. ..that you are destined to die enjoying the same. What are you doing? Suraj! Look here your brother Arjun! Suraj! Bhishma! Arjun..you? By killing my brother you have proved that. - What? Suraj? Don't try and act come with me. Arjun..Bhishma. You are fighting here and there.. ..your brother's coffin is waiting. Light the pyre Bhishma. - Wait. I will light the pyre. I will not let those hands light the pyre, who have killed Suraj. Who has hands full of blood that I know very well. - Arjun! I can answer that too. But at the moment I want to light my brother's pyre. Don't call him your brother. You are the murderer. Look has this..tornado created.. ...any less a havoc in my house than this storm? This darkness is not only outside but in our hearts. In such a stormy night.. ..when your father left me alone in this world. I embraced my three kids and thought.. ..that my kids will make my abode into a heaven. And will get me out of this sorrow. But..today the same sorrow.. ..has become a bane in my life. My innocent Suraj has parted away from me. The light of the pyre is not yet over.. ..mother's tears too haven't stopped flowing. And you all have already murdered my belief in you. You both are thirsty for each other's blood? Mother, if a man is thirsty with greed.. ..then he can murder any amount of relations. You are right it is the greed that made.. ..you kill your brother. I did not murder Suraj but you can do anything to fulfill your dirty plans. Arjun! - Have you gone mad Bhishma? Not me mother but he has gone crazy. He has killed Suraj. - Not me but you have killed him. You ask Mangal Singh he was the witness. No Mangal Singh. That lawyer will give evidence regarding your since. As you had asked for your share in the property Lawyer! Division, now what is this new plot of yours? Why are you two brothers in the dark, who is this Mangal Singh? And who is this lawyer? Some one has made you a victim of their dirty scheme. Just think..when Suraj was even in a little distress.. ..you both would be so tormented. Can any of you ever kill someone who wante.. ..to ruin our entire family. Bhishma you are the eldest, you should understand. I'm able to understan that this entire master plan.. ..is of that Mangal Singh and that lawyer. Those two cannot escape my wrath anymore. I swear on you mother, I kill Suraj's murderers. No brother. The law will punish the guilty not you. The revenge in the brother's death cannot.. ..wait for the law to take its own course. Hey, this man is coming here..be careful. Do you know him? - This is Suraj Sir. He has not come here since long. Don't try and act smart. You know it wey well that he was murdered. Sir, but swear on God I know anything about him. But I wll find out, on the 10 of this month.. Suraj was murdered. I just want to know that that day who was here on duty. We two were there sir. And... ..there were 5 drivers, and Suraj was included in it. Where are the rest 4 drivers? Call them I want to enquire with them. Where will we search for them sir? Hey..before I reach back the police station.. ..they should reach there, it is clear? Good morning sir. - Greetings sir. Shinde, there should be a checking for every vehicle that passes the Mumbai Pune highway. No vehicle should pass without being checked, clear? - Yes, sir. Sir, the four truck drivers you had called have come. Where are they? - In the lock up. Come. Tell me, what do you know about Suraj's murder? We don't know anything, sir. Constable...you all go out. I want to ask them something. Sir! I want to meet the inspector. What? - Sir! I want to meet the inspector. What is it? I want to file a report. By when will the inspector be free? Leave me! Sir, don't beat them so much. Tell me who killed Suraj! Spare them sir. Don't be so brutal to them. If they go to court, you will be in trouble. Sir. As per plan, we raided all places.. ..but got no clue about the murderes. We did not even find any you gave us. But the Malad police had found an unclaimed body some days ago. Whose descripion is very much like Mangal. Any photo? - This is that body's photo. You can go. Only Mangal Singh could lead us to those murderers. But what will I tell Bhishma now? We tricked inspector Arjun in such a manner.. ..that he will never be able to guess all his life. How is that? I killed his brother.. ..and created a rift between him ahd his step brother. Barood Singh - Can I speak to inspector Arjun? Who is calling? Look, I want to give him some important information. I used to wonder how all our news reaches the police. This was the only way to nab you. And finally we.. Hey! Catch her! Please save me. If I had not banged into you today.. ..then perhaps by now.. Why did this lawyer want to kill you? He is not a lawyer. He is Chhagan the brother of the dons of this city, Chamunda Brothers. And they only have murdered Suraj. How can you say this with such conviction? Because until now, I have been working with Chamunda Brothers. You were forced to work for them? - Yes. I wanted to avenge the murder of my family. A year ago, Chamunda Brothers had killed an inspector. My father was an eye witness to that murder. My father's evidence's could send them to the gallows. That is why they not only killed my father.. ..but also my mother and my innocent brother. To take my revenge I started working for Chamunda Brothers. And what information I got, I secretely passed it on to Arjun. This will be your last information. I will take your revenge. Look, how lucky that dog is. How close he is to those girls. If it was us instead of that dog.. ..even we'd be that close to them. We are very unfortunate. It is we who slog day and night.. ..but our boss who has all the fun with his girlfriend. You'll see, even our days will come. Even we will have a good time. We can never get so lucky. We are only destined to do our duty under the hot sun. What are you two fools doing here? We..are..on..duty. But how come you are here? You quit that job of yours? I have closed down my business. Since when? - Since your boss robbed me. Rob..robbed! Our boss robbed you? That means he can be booked under Section 379 If you like, we can arrest him. No...no! I am going to arrest your boss. "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "O my love, I love you." "You are in my dreams. I crave only for you." "You are in my dreams. I crave only for you." "O my love!" "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "Despite meeting you often I crave to meet me." "I didn't feel like this before. What feeling is this?" "This is a new emotion." 'I am bemused. I am in a daze." "I have heard this is what love does to you." "What kind of ecstasy is this?" "I am totally taken in by you. I am los in you." "O my love!" "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "The spell was cast in the first glance itself." "I lost my heart to you." "Gift me your heart." "After swaying in your loving arms.." "..even my life sways with joy." " I gift my heart to you." "I love you. I am committing no crime." "I love you. I am committing no crime." "O my love!" "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "You are in my heart, in my heart beat." "O my love, I love you." "I will make you belong to me, and take you away from here." "O my love!" "You are in my heart, - In my heart beat." - How did the lights go off? - Maybe the fuse went out. Let's go and check. Be careful. I'm not in the habit of talking too much. Where are Chamunda Brothers? We don't know. I will not ask a third time. Where are Chamunda Brothers? I'm telling the truth.They have not come here since many days. I grant you all your life. When chamunda comes, tell him Bhishma had come. Yes. - And will come again. Come, Arjun. How are you? Strange! You recognised me even without having seen me. I recognise the warmth of your hands sonce childhood. What brings you here? A complaint has been lodged against you. You went on a rampage in Chamunda brother's godow. And threatened to kill them. - Who Chamunda brothers - Don't pretend. If Chamunda brothers are Suraj killers,.. ..they will be punished. But you don't take law into your hands. The law needs evidence, and I'll not leave behind any evidence. You can continue doing your duty without worry. Sorry inspector, the cigarette slipped out of my hand. The fire that doesn't extinguish on its own, is put out. Just the way you have arrested Bhishma.. ..for going on a rampage in our godow. The law book talks of evidence. Without evidence, forget the innocent.. ..even the culprit cannot be booked. What nonsense are you talking! Does that mean you haven't arrested that culprit yet? I send culprits straight to the gallows, Mr. Dhawan. Have patience. What are you trying to say, Arjun? Exactly what you are thinking, Mr. Madan. Bhishma's going on a rampage in your godown proves.. ..that you are connected with Suraj's murder. But regretfully, law is depdendent on evidence. But the day I lay my hands on the evidence.. ..I will drag you to jail like dogs. You managed to enter our house, inspector Arjun. But only your corpse will go out of here. And the police department will not even fond your body. That must be the Comissioner. Before coming here, I'd told him that I'm going to mett two dogs. Shall I take the call? - Yes. Hello, - Dhawan, it's me, Chhagan. Yes Comissioner, Inspector Arjun here. Inspector Arjun? What are you doing there? My brother haven't shot you dead yet? The shooting was about to begin when you called. Stop your nonsense and give the line to my brother. Alright, I will keep the phone on the table like you said. If you hear gunshots, come here with the police force. And arrest these mad dogs. I have heard you love telling stories. I'll tell you a story today. This story is of a lion who was thirsty. Looking for water, he reached another jungle. Over there, he met two other lions. The lion stopped him and said he cannot drink water. Instead of being afraid, the lion sprung at them. And he realised that they were not two lions but two donkeys. When the donkeys asked the lion.. ..how he came to know they were donkeys and not lions.. ..he said it was very simple. A lion doesn't need to declare he is lion. Likewisw, even a shooter does not say he is going to shoot. The real shooters just shoots. Even I am like a thirsty lion. The day I find evidence, you two will.. Comissioner... - Brtoher, I am Chhagan. Chhagan, you! That means he was talking to you for so long. I think he fooled us all and ran away. Yes? I wanted to meet inspector Arjun. Inspector Arjun? He has been transferred. Transferred? But where? 'Jhumri Tilaliya'. 'Jhumri Tilaliya'? But he was posted here until yesterday. - Was, not anymore. Ok thank you, let's go. Arjun? What are you doing in my chair? You were not here, so I thought of doing your duty. What is the matter? How come you came to the police station today? I came to tell you to stop being dependent on law. It has been able to help no one until today. So you have come to advise me? It was necessary. Look at this girl. Chamunda brothers have killed her parents too. She kept making the rounds of police stations. She kept calling you and giving you evidence against criminals. What could you do for her until today? I... - You could do nothing. Nothing can be done under this roof. If you look at the sun, it will only dazzle your eyes. Nice reply. Let"s go, Deepa. Just a minute. Where are you going, brother? To watch a film in Gaiety cinema. Even you can come along if you like. No thanks, I'm on duty. They are going for a film and gave us a lecture and went. - Shall I tell you something? - Yes. Even we will go to the movies on a holiday. And we will take cormer seats. What if we don't get corner seats? Then we'll watch the movie, what else? You go and sit, I'll join you soon. I met Supriya in the library. Nice, give me two. What an insolent man! Your sandals are good. You'll had killed my brother, hadn't you? Not me, my brother killed him. I didn't kill him. No...no... I didn't do anything. I didn't kill him. Listen, you go and light the theatre. Shut-up! Sit down all of you. Quiet! Arjun, you? You said you are on duty and you cannot come for the film. Madan, one of the Chamunda brothers, has been murdered. Madan has been murdered? That's good news. One devil less in this world. But Madan must have been murdered somewhere outside.What are you doing here? The culprit is sitting right before my eyes. My only problem is I have no evidence to arrest you. I think you are mistaken. We have been sitting here and watching the film. You two are togheter in this. And your evidence doesn't count. Alright, if you don't trust Deepa, ask someone else. You can ask those girls. Right sister? - Has this man been here all along? - Yes inspector. He is very brazen. He has been teasing us. Brother, man can run, but not faster than time. The law will have a reply to your every smart move. Mark my words! Brother!... - What happened? Brother!...- What happened? I ask what happened? Brother!... - What happened? Madan was killed by Bhishma. Just wipe out those two brothers. Who have snatched my brother from me. Go.. The song were good, but rest of the movie was okay. Deepa.. with your help, I have managed to be succesful.. in my first step of revenge. Bhishma..I'm at the moment with Arjun.. You come to meet me at once. Your mother. Hey stop the vehicle. - What is it? Brother... - Where is mother? I'll call you later. What is the matter? You look very disturbed. I haven't come to your police station, but meet my mother. If you have committed a crime then.. ..you have no right to meet mother. You have no proof regarding my crime. Bhishma. - Mother. What happened mother? What is this unauspicious moment son.. ..the lamp that I lit for prayers went off. This is just a coincidence mother. Both your sons are with you then what can be unauspicious? But mother, why did you come to the city all of sudden? Yesterday night I had a very bad dream.. ..as if the enemy wants to snatch youaway like Suraj. My heart was at unrest. And came to see you. I have a lot of grievance with you both. Both are staying separately in the same city? Bhishma! ..Arjun! Mother! - Left. Come on..turn to the left..let it go on. Come on ..let it go back. Easy easy. Corect.. come on let it go back. Hey... what are you doing? Listen Arjun, I cannot give you warrants against Chamunda. See we don't have any proof against them. Enough sir. The laws knows only one word proof..proof..proof. I'm tired of this word. Whenever we want to take action .. .. we are restricted because of lack of enough proof. Sir..today my mother died. Tomorrow some other from your house dies. What will you do.. will you run behind him? Arjun, your talks carry weight. Let me tell you one thing. I have been hearing since childhood that the law can reach very far.. .., but sir it is not so, but the law is bound with restrictions. And because of this restrictions ..our sepoys are getting killed. After that a huge function is held.. ..the sepoy's photograph is honoured.. ..and his relatives are awarded with some money. And big people like you stand and give ovation. That's it and next moment they are forgotten. When will this nation be freed? When? Hello. - Brother, there is a bad news. Bad news? - Yes brother. - What is it? Chhagan is killed. - No! Robert. - Yes brother? Inform Bihari, Anna and Carlos. That tomorrow at 12 midnight.. ..Chamunda is selling the Mumbai city. Allright This is my Mumbai. The dream city of India. This is that town where every Indian dreams of settling down. Where every Mafia dreams of ruling. Today I'm going to have a city which was obtained.. ..by the dominance and the power of Chamunda brothers.. ..today it will be auctioned. For such a small job what was the need to gather this crowd? You could have called up on the phone and we would have bestowed you with all the wealth. No Bihari! Chamunda is a bigger merchant than you. My underworld, gambling dens and casino's.. ..have a mass of wealth flowing. I don't need the money. The what do you want? I want these two men... Alive. Only two men? - Yes. The bidding starts from deal. Any one of you who fulfills the job, I will hand over.. ..the golden Key of Mumbai and leave India for good. But where will we find these two? They will surely in search of me.. ..will reach one of my dens. Come on bring it the box here. Where's Chamunda? - I don't know anything. Truly.. I don't know. I don't know anything. This gun has a bullet named on you. Where's Chamunda? - I don't know anything. I will tell you where Chamunda is. Why are you killing that poor man? Brother he is a very big Don of India. He is Anna from the South. And that is Bihari who shudders the north. Today.. the enemies of the nation are here.. ..now this is not just a revenge but a major battle. What is this? Arjun, what is this? I think its their parcel - Lets see. This parcel is in your name. - Take it. Take it. Brother. Hey son.. It is your age to play with toys. Don't pick this gun. Hey you..stop firing those crackers. Or else I will shoot your brothers head off. Death dancing over your head.. ..and say that don't get scared. Don't shoot. Take this. I dropped the gun. This is called as love for the brother. Very good Bihari, I did not know that these two.. ..will come into our hands so easily. And such a big city Mumbai is in our fists. Do you both know that in lure of your lives.. ..Chamunda is giving us the golden Key of Mumbai. But there is a problem. Mumbai city is one and you are three. How will you distribute amongst yourselve? And the important thing is, who will take us to Chamunda? You..you..or you? And another thing is that whoever takes us to Chamunda.. ..the Mumbai city will belong to him. Yes. For which two will have to die and one will remain alive. You all decide who willremain alive. Till then I'm sitting with my brother. - Yes come. Okay now attack. - Start off. Come lets sit here. Ring side seats. Whom do you think will win? - Anna. I think Bihari will win. Anna will win..See. He is very strong. Bihari will win , the people from Bihar are very strong. One is gone. Now two are left. Now in these two see Anna will win. I say Bihari will win. If he does then I will kill Chamunda. And if Anna wins then I will kill Chamunda. - Okay. Here brother.. ..these two are gone and the third is the winner. Lets congratulate him. - He has won. Congratulations. You were great? Listen, call up Chamunda. I just call him here, right now. - Do it then. This is Carlos, I have caught hold of these rats. You come here soon. Carlos..you fulfilled your promis. Now by killing both of them I will fulfill my promise. The humanity cannot be wiped out, even if a human is. What ever strategy may a devil plan When a Satan will encourage the injuste and wrongdoing. And then will arrive and destroyers the evil. This is a Challenge!
