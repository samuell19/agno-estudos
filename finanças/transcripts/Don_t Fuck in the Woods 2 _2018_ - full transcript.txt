(dramatic, theme music) [Man] Tainted Productions. (dramatic, theme music) (rattling film reel) (foreboding, theme music) (dramatic, distorted music) (woman screaming) (quiet, ominous music) (creature growls) (woman screaming) (eerie, ominous music) (labored breathing) (woman shrieking) (eerie, ominous music) (creature growling) (woman shrieking) No. (Sobbing) (eerie, ominous music) (creature shrieks) (woman gurgling) (upbeat, energetic, rock music) (woman gasping) (dramatic, suspenseful music) (foot thunks) (dramatic, suspenseful music) (dramatic, suspenseful music) - Mother fucker. (gentle, eerie music) (boots thump) (scrape) (phone ringing) Gil. [Walter] Hey there. Hey Walter. [Walter] How ya hanging in there? Well just walking the grounds. Jesus Christ, Walter, how'd you keep this place open for so long? I'm seeing like six or seven code violations. The damn cabins are falling apart. [Walter] Well friend, that's why we have you there. I need that campsite up and running within a week. And given your current situation, I didn't figure some hard work and fresh air would hurt. That wasn't me complaining, Walter. [Walter] I know, Gil, I know. Walter, this nurse and these kids, they know about... [Walter] They know that you're a handyman and that's all they need to know. Walter... [Walter] They don't need to know anything else other than you and Miss Hemsgrove are in charge. So they're showing up today? [Walter] They should be there within the next few hours, Gil, just do me a favor. What? [Walter] They're barely old enough to drink, so be patient with 'em. - Great. - You'll be fine. Listen, I'm gonna jump off here, I just wanted to check in and make sure everything was going okay for ya. Thanks Walter. [Walter] Don't mention it. I'll call you tomorrow to check in. Have a good one. You too. (gentle, dramatic music) Shit. (insects singing) (gentle, dramatic music) (hammer thumping) (gentle, dramatic music) (gravel crackling) (gentle, dramatic music) (hammer thumping) (gravel crackling) [Woman] Excuse me, we're a little lost. Uh... (women giggle) Yeah, where you tryin' to find? Uh, Brook Haven Metro Park? Uh, (chuckles) it's um, five miles that way. (women giggle) - Thank you. - Oh. (gentle, dramatic music) (hammer thumping) (upbeat, energetic, rock music) (hammer thumping) (energetic, rock music) (doors clatter) My friends, we have arrived. (woman talking quietly) (door clatters) [Charlie] Perfect setting for several days of food, booze and debauchery. We can talk about the first two, but, let's take it easy on the latter. Well hello Mr. Tall Drink of Water. Who is you? I believe that would be Mr. Gil. He's in charge of the construction program. [Tasha] Is that a first or a last name? Why don't you guys get settled in? I'm gonna go talk with him. Um, and just to be clear, there is plenty of room in my bunk for you two fine-ass women. Her loss, I guess that just leaves you, Hannah Montana. Yeah, I'd rather sleep on salty, glass-covered pavement. (gravel crackling) [Vanessa] Hello. [Gil] Hey. [Vanessa] Vanessa Hemsgrove, I'll be your acting... Nurse, yeah, Walter told me. And you must be Gillum Ross? Just Gil. Well Walter's had nothing but great things to say about you, Gil. [Gil] Likewise. Um, just thought I'd come introduce myself since we're gonna be working together the next few days. Well, I don't wanna disturb you. Uh, just be careful out there, all right? What do you mean? Oh, I haven't walked the rest of the grounds yet, so I've already found some hazards, so there'll be others. Just be careful, and if you find a hazard, come to me. Understood. And, it would be kind of bad if something happened to our site nurse, right? No, we wouldn't want that now, would we? Someone's liable to get a band aid on an ankle, so. Duly noted. (door rattles) Welcome to the Pine Hilton, boys. [Charlie] (chuckles) No. Did you get a side of tetanus shot with this cabin? (insects singing) (door squeaks) (switch clicks) (door squeaks) (bags rustling) (zipper buzzes) (door clatters) (chuckles) Daddy's home. Ew, dude, get the fuck outta here. What, you know you want me in. Bye Charlie. So, what are you ladies up to today? Uh, we're probably gonna lay out. [Courtney] Yep. I think I'm gonna go see what Mason's up to. Obvious much? What? Mason is a hunter. (laughs) Mason doesn't hunt. Jesus fucking Christ, guys like Mason like the unobtainable. They like the thrill of the chase. Okay. Okay, so he's a lion, and you're a fucking elephant. I'm not fat. For fuck sake, Mason takes one look at you and he knows he can have you because, like an elephant, you're just there, and fucking obvious. Mason wants a gazelle that he can chase down and tear apart. (sighs) Well, (claps hands) I'm gonna go get some work done. You girls have a good day. (door rattles) (quiet, ominous music) (engine humming) (quiet, ominous music) (keys clink) (rattle) [Driver] Well, this could just have to do. Well, right to life, right? [Driver] Yeah. (doors clatter) (woman sighs) (leaves crackling) Well I'm sure we'll find some great spots to take some photo shots. Yes, I think so. (leaves crackling) (quiet, ominous music) (upbeat, rock music) (hammer thunking) (Courtney chuckles) - That was really rude. That's not what I meant, she took it the wrong way. (hammer thunking) (upbeat, rock music) What are you looking at my girls for? (upbeat, rock music) (hand smacks ass) (men horse playing) (upbeat, rock music) (insects singing) [Woman] Harper. I'm gonna find you. (insects singing) (quiet, dramatic music) Oh, I see what game we're playing now, huh. (ominous, rhythmic music) (insects singing) [Blond] You found me. [Nicole] What do I win? You might just win me. (giggles) I like that. Oh, I like that. Oh. (Giggles) (blond sighs) (blond giggles) (rhythmic, upbeat music) (Nicole moans) [Miley] It says here that 65% of all people have sex while they're camping. You get service out here? Yeah. Bullshit, there's no way. Why? Because it's a proven fact that once people get away from the fuss of civilization, they let their primal side come out. This number's gotta be higher. How much higher? 95%, at least. Eh, I highly doubt it. Why, I mean, think about it, campfire, peace and quiet, nobody around for miles, primal instincts kick in, baby. (men chuckle) - Well, you obviously don't understand how pussy works. (rhythmic, upbeat music) (Nicole moaning quietly) Yeah, not to mention it'd be, like, super uncomfortable. I mean, scraped knees, elbows, branches and rocks under you, eh. You need to shut that shit down. It just means you're not doing it right, Courtney. Always be on top. - That's right. - Good point. That's right, always be on top. And by the way, they make stereotypes about this thing in horror movies and stuff, and there's gotta be a reason for that, right? Yeah. (Courtney laughs) Yeah, and girls just love it when you stick it up their ass, just like in porn, too. - No. - Really? - No. - Really. No, I was being fascist. Facetious. (chuckles) Whatever. (upbeat, rhythmic music) (accelerated breathing) (Nicole gasps) (sighs) Hey Charlie, grab me that bottle of SPF. Today, preferably. Whoa, hey tiger. (men mutter) Don't miss my shoulders. I mean, don't get me wrong, though, if I was walking through the woods and that Gil guy showed up... That guy? He's like 40! Not to mention, he's as bald as Tasha's stabbing cabin. (laughs) Okay, I really like bald guys and he's older, which means he doesn't have to be trained as much. Amen to that. (Grunts) Just right in there, bro', just right, (pops tongue) Yeah bro', get in there. (Nicole gasping) (upbeat, rhythmic music) You like that, baby? (Nicole gasping) Nicole, Nicole! (foot thunks) (Nicole gasping) (laughs) Charlie's got mahogany. (men laughing) - What? (laughs) Dude, it was like 10 seconds. It's human nature, it's primal. (group laughing) [Tasha] You underwhelm me. Oh. (Laughs) What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? [Tasha] Prove to us you're not a two-pump chump. [Charlie] Come the fuck on. How about you and I take a walk over there? Mm, walk huh? - Mm hmm. - Mmm, is that all? Oh no, I'm pretty sure we can figure other things to do. - Mm, oh yeah? - Oh yeah. (insects singing) What's happening, hot stuff? I thought you guys went to lay out or something? We were, but Charlie got religion while putting sunscreen on me. What? I can't reach my back. Uh huh. It's not what you think. Oh sure. You know what, I don't think you're as immune to the rigors of careless sex after all, Nurse Betty. Contrary to popular belief, there are more important things to talk about than just sex. Really, like what? Like fixing this cabin. And Mr. Gil is doing a great job adhering to all the rules and I think we should follow his example. (engine humming) (hammer thumping) (birds chirping) (insects singing) (door clatters) Well, looks pretty nice. I like it out here. This is nice, real nice. Help you with something? [Officer] Got a nice setup out here, huh? It's all right. (chuckles) All right? Yeah, I'll say it's all right. Jesus, wide, open space, freedom to go about your day, I bet you get a nice workout out here too, don't ya? [Gil] Sure. Sure. Yeah, it's really nice. Oh, and the poon walking around here, holy Mary mother of fuck. Bet you're just in Heaven out here, aren't you? Come on, Gil, you can't tell me the thought hasn't crossed your mind. After five years, I would've thought you would have worn one of these fur burgers as a flesh condom by now. Are you kidding? Look at him, he would wanna bitch any one of us if given the opportunity. You can see it in his eyes. I seriously doubt that. Well, we'll see about that. (chuckles) Gil is way too old for you. So was my therapist. God. Uh, five oh is here. Did somebody order bacon? [Vanessa] I have no idea. Ah, there he is. What's wrong, push your button? No sir. No sir? That's really good. See, it'd a been a shame if you timed out to go right back in, assaulting an officer of the law. Know what I mean? Is there something I can help you with, officer? And you are? [Vanessa] Vanessa Hemsgrove, the nurse here at the camp. Mrs. Hemsgrove. Miss. Ah Miss, well, no need to be alarmed, just taking up my friend, Gil here, standard procedure to keep tabs on ex-cons. Wait, so this guy's an ex-con? They can't be around girls and such, right? Depends on what they were locked up for. Mr. Gil's doing a find job. (laughs) Mr. Gil. That's cute. You're interrupting Mr. Gil's job, so if there was something, someone you'd like to speak with... No no no, that's not necessary. (door clatters) You behave yourself, Gil, I don't wanna get any phone calls from any of these fine ladies, saying that you've misbehaved. We clear? Crystal. Well that's good. All righty, you folks have a great day. We'll see you soon, Mr. Gil. [Vanessa] Don't you got something to do? Tsk tsk tsk, naughty boy. [Vanessa] Go. (mutters) We got stuff to, do. (knife patters) (liquid burbles) (quiet, ominous music) (insects singing) (lighter clicking) (flames crackling) - Hey. - Hey. (chair rattles) - Thanks. - Yeah. There she is. [Vanessa] Yeah yeah, so what's the skinny? The skinny, people still say shit like that? Yes, just 'cause I'm a little older doesn't mean I don't still know the hip lingo. (group giggles) - Yeah, the hip lingo, okay. No uh, we were actually just discussing our ex-con handyman. Listen, I get you guys may be a little confused or on edge, but trust me, you literally have nothing to worry about. Why, just 'cause the boss-man said it's cool? Yeah, that makes me feel so much better. Things like this is normal. Sometimes when people's been in the system, they need a little assistance on a job and Mr., I mean, he's been staying to himself. Just leave him alone. All I know is people like that have a lot of pent up aggression and shit. Oh yeah, and how many ex-con men do you know? That's what I thought. And you too, weren't you just saying you were into his sexy, working man vibe, literally a few hours ago? (clears throat) Yeah, you were. That was before they knew he got locked up, though. I think it just makes it sexier. Always a sucker for the bad boys, huh Tasha? Lay off Gil already, he's keeping to himself, we don't need you all making it a little bit awkward. I still wanna know what he was locked up for. My bet's drugs. I think he got caught running. Nah, he looks like a breaking and entering guy. (Gil whistles) (dramatic music) Jesus Christ, creep much? Miley. What? I just came to check out the fire. (quiet, dramatic music) So come on, Gil, what'd you get locked up for? [Vanessa] That's none of your business. Well, about five years ago, friend of mine, came, asked for help, he got in with some bad people, owed a lot of money. What's a lot? About 500. (chuckles) $500, that's not a lot. $500,000. - Fuck. - Damn. So what happened? Well, he came to me, had a plan about scrapping cars to make money to pay the debt off. Doesn't sound like you'd make that much money. I mean, not $500,000. Well it wouldn't, but if you can make cars disappear, it would. Cars that belong to very bad people. And so that's what we did, we made cars disappear. Wait a second, you're telling me you ran a chop shop? We did. And the money flowed in like a flood. He was able to pay off his debt. Should a stopped though. We didn't. We got greedy. So how'd you get caught? Eh, it seems we weren't as close as I thought we were. Cops got wind of the operation, brought him in, basically offered him a deal which would pin the whole thing on me. So he sold you out. Damn dude, that is cold blooded. Yeah, he uh, basically got probation and I got 10 years, sentenced to state prison, Lebanon State Prison, served five, got out on good behavior. (chuckles non-humorously) Fuck. To Gil. The unluckiest car-killer alive. (glasses clinking) Hey, where are you two headed off to, the party's just getting started. Eh, we're gonna take a little stroll and make a little party of our own. Now guys, stay close, take a flashlight. But if we're too close, you'll hear us. (Giggles) Try to keep some reservations about yourselves. Yeah, and uh, watch out for snakes and Poison Ivy, and um, herpes. (groups laughs) - Fuck you, douche schnakal. Hey, if that's an offer, I am down for a love sandwich. Courtney, you can be the roast beef. Oh. (Laughs) (group laughing) Fuck off. Roast beef? (Laughs) I know you love roast beef, dude. Listen, roast beef, (laughs) wait here, count to 10, and then follow the trail and come find me. Why? 'Cause I have a surprise for you. What kind of surprise? It's gonna be a big surprise, it's gonna blow your mind. Okay. (Laughs) So you're in to bad boys? I could be a bad boy. (insects singing) (fire crackling) Where you headed off to? Anywhere you're not. (Hands slap legs) (fire crackling) (insects singing) Tah dah! [Courtney] (giggles) What? Yeah? You wanna get in the tent or you wanna mull it over? [Courtney] Oh my God. (Laughs) Get in. (Zipper buzzing) (mutters) (grunts) Yeah see, look. I brought a bag of toys. - Oh. And bug-free. All right, so I admit, I like the tent, but explain this. - What? Oh this. - Yeah. Oh, you know how cosplay is my kink. - Uh huh. - Yeah, you remember the thing with the fairies? - Mm hmm. - Shh, let's not talk about that, it was a dark time for us. But this, like look, we're out in the woods, it's like an 80's movie with the hockey masks and the stabbings and things like that, and I'm like the unruly camper and you're like the hot, sexy, camp counselor that I'm just tryin' to fuck. Yeah. (chuckles) Don't they usually die in those movies? Yeah, but we're just gonna do the sex part. (laughs) That's when they die. Yeah, but we're just gonna do the sex part. [Courtney] Oh my God. Oh, or, I could be a bounty hunter. [Courtney] Okay, now we're talkin'. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain naked, you take that off and I'll take this off, 'cause I have that right too. It's equal rights around here. You have the right, give me this, goddamn it. Just take that off, fuckin', (clothing clatters) (laughs) Anything you say can and will be held against my body. Your dick smuggling days are over! You will take these off and you are going downtown, gimme, gimme 'em. You know, if you ask me, that's just rude. I mean, we're all here, having a good time, right, having fun, and they just get up and walk off. Come on! (door rattles) (Mason whistles) I didn't think you got the hint. Oh, I got it. You got it, huh? Yeah. Wanna see it? (rhythmic, sassy music) [Mason] Oh fuck. (rhythmic, sassy music) Well uh, I guess it's just you and me, kitten whiskers. (Miley chuckles quietly) No Charlie. It's just you, boo. I'm crashing. (fire crackling) I think I'm in love. [Will] Playing hard to get, that's fine. [Courtney] Yeah. Get over here, criminals. All right, so, woop, you like these underwear, you criminal, that's right, you do. Get out of here. Here. Here we are. - Oh. There we go. (Courtney breathing heavy) (quiet, dramatic music) There you go. Gotta like that, you're the best camp counselor I've ever had. Too bad I had to arrest you. (grunting) Ye haw, come on! Oh now, mm mm, we did cowboys last time. Okay, sorry sorry sorry. (upbeat, rock music) (Tasha groaning) (upbeat, rock music) (door clatters) (upbeat, rock music) So uh, I'm like super tired, I mean it's like, what time, like 2:00? 10:30. (exhales) Really? Shit. Tell you what, man, in the shed, underneath the mattress. Okay. So, what are you doing here? You know my story, what's yours? Not much of a story to tell. Oh, I don't believe that for a second. What makes you say that? Well because Walter told me a little bit about you. Graduated St. Johns in a DSNC with para-anesthesiology. Impressive. Just because I'm a simple guy doesn't mean I'm a stupid one, Miss Hemsgrove. Ah, I knew you'd like this mullet ride. (Courtney mutters) - Ah, I know, that's what mullets do, they're magical. (Grunts) (Courtney giggles) (Will grunting) All right, okay. All right, you criminal, 'bout ready to take you in. - Yeah? - Oh yeah. Okay. (Grunts) Okay, oh okay. (Grunts) (laughs) Oh, that's mullet magic, baby. Oh. (Exhaling) [Courtney] Shit. Did you like that? [Courtney] Yeah. (Mutters) You gotta pee? Well don't do it here. (Courtney laughs) (mutters) Do you think I could grow a mullet on my pubes? (zipper buzzes) (quiet, dramatic music) (creature squishing) (quiet, dramatic music) (magazines clap) (Charlie exhales) God fuckin' bless you, Gil. (laughs) Girl. (door clatters) (upbeat, rock music) (Tasha groaning) (quiet, dramatic music) (creature squishes) (quiet, dramatic music) So, why after all of that, would you be wasting your skills as a nurse here? Seems like, to me, you're running from something. Or someone. (upbeat, rock music) (stool screeches) (upbeat, rock music) (Tasha grunting) Let's just say, when you're in a relationship with your boss, it casts a dark shadow over someone with a career like mine and when said boss fails to let you know that he's married, yeah. Then you just move locations, you don't take the cheapest paying job, watching a bunch of kids. (dramatic, suspenseful music) What the fuck is that? (Shrieking) Yeah, they seem a little rough around the edges at times, but they're really good kids. Well, to us, society's misfits. (bottles clink) (Vanessa chuckles) (gentle, quiet music) (birds chirping) (gentle, quiet music) (clomping footsteps) (door clatters) [Mason] Good morning, sweet cheeks. Now you're just teasing me. Rough night? Oh, I was just being a lion tamer. (chair clatters) What's up her ass? Miss Hemsgrove. [Vanessa] Mr. Gil. Missing somebody? You know, I've not seen Will or Court this morning. That's funny, I didn't hear 'em come in last night either. You apparently wouldn't have heard shit after all this... (Charlie slams table) Anyways, he didn't sneak into your guy's bunk last night, did he? (sighs) I told them to stay close. I'm sure they're fine. I'll go look for them in a minute. I'm sure they just uh, passed out after their walk. Anyone of you know how much a fully grown brown bear weighs? About 500 pounds. (Sighs) [Vanessa] Please tell me you're joking. Nope. But do I think something happened? Not really. But it's something that needs to be on all of your minds if you decide to trek out into the woods alone. Well uh, I'll make sure to keep that in mind, but do we, by chance have, like, a rifle on site, or something, just in case? Forgot, ex-con. Tell you what, Chuck, why don't you use your winning personality if you run into wildlife? It should be a solid deterrent. By the way, you smell like Mason's dick. Oh, better than smelling like loneliness and depression. (women chuckle) (Vanessa mutters) (door clatters) (woman screaming) (chairs clatter) [Woman] Help me, help me! (Screaming) Help me! - Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa! - Let go of me! Easy, easy. (Woman screaming) (dramatic, ominous music) Yes! - Let me go! - Chill! (Grunts) You don't understand, it's out there! My friends, they're all... (Gil groaning) - Jesus Gil, are you okay? - God. - Come help me. Get him up. (Gil grunting) Somebody get her up and let's get her to the med-bed. (groaning) Who the fuck is this bitch? [Mason] You're taking grandpa, I'll carry her. (gentle, dramatic music) (birds chirping) (men grunt) [Gil] Jesus. (Grunts) (gentle, ominous music) (lighter clicks) (gentle, ominous music) Will! Will, where are you? (Mason grunts) (labored breathing) (quiet, ominous music) She's so bloody. Laceration on her forehead, laceration on left thigh. (Vanessa sighs) You okay? [Vanessa] Yeah, just a little unexpected is all. Are you okay? [Miley] I'll be fine. What the hell happened to her? (gentle, ominous music) Courtney! Will! Was that roast beef an all-night buffet? (gentle, ominous music) She's stable for now. Let's check back on her in a few hours. A few hours? What the fuck did you hit her with? [Vanessa] A sedative. Okay, so what do we do now? [Gil] I think it's time to make that call. [Miley] Agreed. Tash, can you go and get the sat. Phone? You two, I want everyone back at this camp before sunset, no more wandering around. Go get Charlie, look for Will and Courtney, bring 'em back here to the nurse's station. (Vanessa sighs) (gentle, ominous music) What the fuck? (rustling leaves) (gentle, ominous music) Jesus fucking Christ. (leaves rustling) (zipper buzzes) Oh shit. I guess we're doing this. You all right? I don't know, just something's not right. Other than the obvious? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but (chuckles non-humorously) She comes running out of nowhere, damn near ferrel, talking about something being out in the woods. (Sighs) We're about 50 miles away from the nearest civilization, it's not really painting a... Gil, you might wanna come look at this. What now? Clean up, you look like shit. I'll figure out what's going on. (quiet, foreboding music) Oh shit. (quiet, foreboding music) What the fuck? (dramatic, menacing music) (Charlie screaming) (quiet, eerie music) (insects singing) You okay? Yeah, my ankle still hurts a bit. Let me see. (gentle, quiet music) Oh yeah, definitely a sprain. (Miley grunts) Sorry. Um, you're fine. You think you could get my shoulders instead? I just feel so tense. Yeah, sure. (gentle, quiet music) (Miley groans) You don't feel that tense. Let me ask you something. Go for it. Why Tasha? What? You and Tasha, I don't get it. Miles, it's not like we're... There's nothing special about her and there's nothing that she can do that I can't. Or better. (gentle, quiet music) Miles look, there's just nothing here between you and I. I mean... There could be. (gentle, quiet music) [Mason] (sighs) No, Miley, we are in two different leagues. You need a good guy and I am not a good guy. Maybe I don't want a good guy. [Mason] And I don't want you. I'm sorry. Fine, have fun with your cum guzzling gutter slut! What did you do now? (gentle, foreboding music) (door clatters) (gentle, foreboding music) (door rattles) (gentle, foreboding music) (grass rustling) (gentle, foreboding music) (shrieks) Where the fuck am I? - Stay down. - Who the fuck are you? [Vanessa] I'm Nurse Vanessa Hemsgrove. You're at Pine Hills Camp. (fist thumps) - Ow! (Grunts) Gil, give her some space. [Gil] Bitch, would you stop hitting me? [Woman] What did you hit me with? A sedative. The effects have not worn off yet. I promise, no one's gonna hurt you. [Mason] What happened? [Gil] Bitch just went in with a hair trigger. - Sorry. - Jesus. [Vanessa] Can you tell me your name? Jane. [Gil] Oh, I swear to God, if you say your last name is Doe... Fuck off. [Vanessa] What are you doing out here, Jane? We were on vacation. My friends and I were camping. Something, something attacked us. There's something in the woods. Whoa whoa whoa, sit. What kind of something? I don't know, some animal, a monster. What the hell are you talking about, what monster? It hunted us down. It killed my friends. It killed, Alex. [Vanessa] I need to know exactly what happened, are there others out there? They're dead, they're all dead. [Vanessa] Gil, we've gotta call somebody. Where's the sat. Phone? Smashed. I don't know how... - What? It's a no go. [Vanessa] Oh my God, Will, Courtney, Charlie? Nobody's come back yet. God, what is going on? [Gil] Hell if I know. There are people missing. She shows up, talking about her friends are being killed by some monster? [Gil] I really don't think she's the most reliable source of information right now, Vanessa. [Vanessa] Even so, I have three counselors missing and after what I've seen the past few hours... [Gil] What are you talking about now? Come look at this. (quiet, foreboding music) The fuck is that? I don't know, but it came out of Jane's leg. She's sick, contagious? I don't know. (Gil snaps fingers) No bullshit, what is that all over you? Pick a friend. Let's hear about this monster of yours. (Miley crying) (distant popping) Tasha? Just go away, okay? You were right, (crying) I'm not a gazelle, I'm just a fucking elephant. (Crying) (ominous, foreboding music) Tasha? (Miley screaming) (dramatic, menacing music) That's the last thing I remember. I woke up, heard some not-too-friendly shit in the woods, stumbled up on you people, and here we are. (chuckles) No, I call bullshit, it's gotta be bullshit. But you said you killed the thing, though, right? [Jane] As far as I know. There wasn't much left. Gil? I'll start the car. Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what? You don't actually believe this horseshit, do you? Listen, Abercrombie, you wanna hang around here, be my guest. What about the others, we're just gonna fuckin' take off and leave 'em? Mason's right, Gil, I'm not leaving those kids out there. We gotta go find them. So we go out there and risk something happening to all of us? I am with Gil, I say we hightail it the fuck outta here. And what if it was you? If I was stupid enough to go out there alone, I'd expect you to spill one for your homey and get the fuck outta dodge. Bitch. Hey, don't sit there and act like you'd be all heroic for me if I was the one out there. You can't go out there. If there are more of those out there, believe me, your friends are more than likely dead. Well, (sighs) I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this horseshit anymore. There are no goddamn monsters out here and I'm not gonna bolt all because some crack whore decided she was gonna run into camp and tell us all about her friends that got killed by some Gil-man. (door clatters) Actually, they were ripped apart. Vanessa. Gil, please. Goddamn it, all right, fine, Vanessa and I will go look for the others, you guys stay here in case they come back. Nice try, handsome, but I'm not staying here. Didn't you just say it was smarter not to go out there? (chuckles, unamused) And I still stand by that. However, I'd be more comfortable with you out there than stuck here. [Vanessa] Where's Miley? Last I saw her, she was headed towards the bathhouse. Can you please go get her? The last thing we need is to be separated right now. I'm gonna go get some more supplies in case anybody else gets hurt. I don't think a bandaid's gonna cure what's more than likely happened to them. Our thoughts stay positive, please. Stay with her. I guess I'm gonna get flashlights. (door clatters) (chair creaks) Sorry about the whole crack whore jab. (door rattles) (quiet, foreboding music) (towel dispenser rumbling) (water hissing) (quiet, foreboding music) (Jane crying) (quiet, foreboding music) (zipper buzzes) (items rusting) (gasps) Jesus, Will, where the hell have you guys been? (quiet, foreboding music) Will? Oh my God. (dramatic, menacing music) (Vanessa screaming) (dramatic, menacing music) Oh no, please, no! (dramatic, menacing music) (will growls) (Vanessa screaming) Oh my God, oh my God. (Vanessa screams) (Will grunting) (dramatic, menacing music) (Vanessa yells) (dramatic, menacing music) (Vanessa screams) (dramatic, menacing music) (men grunting) (dramatic, menacing music) (gasps) Oh my God. (gasps) Holy shit. Oh my God, what is happening? (Crying) Miley. (Door clatters) Miley? What the fuck!? Vanessa! (eerie, distorted music) (door clatters) Jesus fucking Christ. (Grunts) [Gil] Yeah, he's dead. Oh no shit, I couldn't tell from the scissors sticking out of his fucking head. (Sighs) [Vanessa] Whatever happened to Will has happened to the others out there. And what, exactly, is that? Eh, yeah we're still working on it. It attaches itself to the host and causes severe mutation. (sighs) Fuck. However, without the host being active, the parasite can't thrive. And there's no way to save the host? With this severe of a mutation, I don't think so. So what happens to the parasite? (dramatic, menacing music) (parasite screeching) (Tasha exhales) (parasite squishing) (distant hissing) Whoa, they did not like that. [Mason] Oh my God! (eerie, distorted music) Get the window! Hey! (Mason grunts) (hyperventilating) What the fuck's wrong with them? What was that? I don't know, and at this point, I don't care. Just help me. [Vanessa] Gil, this isn't normal. [Gil] I don't think that constitutes as normal, tonight. Look at this. [Gil] What am I looking for? His heart, he was still changing. It's filled with puncture wounds and holes. Whatever that thing was was filling him full of hormones and adrenaline. That's what the fuck that as throwing me around like a rag doll. Yeah, but there's more to it than that. What do you mean? Well think about it for a second, (sighs) what's the heart do? Pumps blood. It was feeding oxygen and blood into his body. - Okay. - Well, what was that thing gunning toward when it come out of his mouth? [Gil] Tasha? What about me? It also feeds blood into certain areas of the body. Oh. Okay. Yeah, which is how it spreads, it takes over the entire reproductive system, pumps an excessive amount of adrenaline, hormones into the body, overpowers it's prey and infects them. Ew. So what you're saying is this thing has a source, like a patient zero? I don't know. That's about all I got at this point. Shh. Listen. (engine humming) (quiet, ominous music) (door clatters) (quiet, ominous music) (insects singing) Bowman! Fuck, I gotta go get him. (Slaps wall) You can't go out there. Not gonna let him fuckin' die.

Yeah, there's (mutters) (door clattering) (quiet, ominous music) Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa. Get your hands up, Gil. Bowman, calm down. Get your hands up, you fucking convict. Bowman, you gotta listen to me, man, calm down, there's some fucked up shit happening tonight... I don't wanna hear it. What the fuck are you doing? You're fucking planting evidence?

Keep walking to the door, asshole, walk to the fucking door. - Goddamn it. (officer muttering) Fucking dip-shit, Mayberry ass, mother fucker. [Officer] Shut your fucking pie hole, keep walking. (officer muttering) Oh no, why is he taking him? Uh, we have to go explain. [Officer] How do you feel now, tough guy, huh... [Gil] Fuck you, Bowman. [Officer] Piece of shit. - Just fuckin'... - Shut your fuckin' mouth! (Gil grunts) [Gil] Oh, you are so making a fucking mistake. [Officer] Oh, am I really? Am I really making a mistake? (Gil grunts) Huh? You're going to jail, creep. Huh, you wanna fuck around, you've gotta... [Tasha] Stop, it's not... Everybody calm the fuck down, goddamn it. (cuffs click) (group chattering) [Tasha] Do you know what's happening right now? [Officer] What's happening right now? Shut the fuck up. (dramatic, ominous music) - The fuck? - Oh shit.

(Grunting) (quiet, dramatic music) (insects singing) It's after Tash, we've gotta go after it. (Grunts) How do you even know she's still alive? (distant screaming) Call it a hunch. (Grunts) Is there anything useful in there? (sighs) We'll see. (Grunting) That work? Yeah. Vacation's over. Time to get to work. (quiet, ominous music) Hey whoa whoa whoa.
