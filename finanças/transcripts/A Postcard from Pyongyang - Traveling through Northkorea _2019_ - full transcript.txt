Twelve kilometers to go. Oh, I'm dead! I've already covered 30 kilometers. At the moment the damn heat and my worsening condition are the only things on my mind. And there's just no water anymore! I can't feel my legs anymore, I'm at kilometer 41 â almost at the stadium. But wait. Why am I doing this to myself? And why in Pyongyang of all places? Well, to explain that, I have to go back a bit. In 2012 the press was full of reports about North Korea. The North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il died in December 2011. The world was looking forward to 28-year-old Kim Jong-Un and what his next steps may be. An old Asian proverb says: âIt's better to see something once, than to hear about it a thousand times.â So why not give ourselves a firsthand impression? At the start of 2013 we made our decision. My buddy Phillipp and I are going to North Korea. Our first challenge starts with booking the trip. Actually, we always travel to countries on our own. There is no individual tourism in North Korea. Everything including the entry and exit booking is taken over by an agency. Before we enter, we must declare that we have no journalistic intentions. Photos only with permission but above all no sound or film recordings. All the following video recordings were therefore made with my photo camera, which can also film. I camouflaged the blinking red ârecordâ light with a piece of black duct tape. We are not aware of the possible consequences. But one thing is clear: we want to smuggle as much material as possible back to Germany. At that time we do not know yet, what we intend to do with it later. There are several ways to travel to North Korea. We decide to take a 25 hour train ride from Beijing to Pyongyang. That sounds long â and so it is. But it's worth the trip! Our first stop is the Chinese border town Dandong. We are in the train, it's close to 11 am we are about to reach North Korea, as soon as we have passed the bridge. They have exchanged carriages. They have taken our passports and we are about 200 meters far from the North Korean boarder. There is a one-hour time difference. We'll sit on the train all day. Don't forget â after the bridge, the train stops and then our luggage is searched. Let's see what the countryside from North Korea looks like. Arrived in Pyongyang we are picked up at the station by two guides. They are our watchdogs for the next seven days. Pyongyang has 3 million inhabitants but only two hotels for foreign visitors. We will stay at the Koryo Hotel. We are looking forward to a privately guided tour along the achievements of the country. We are driven from door to door and are not allowed to move alone without our guides. Do you have your flight tickets? -Flight tickets back to Germany? -Yes, your E-tickets. Sure. Here, from Pyongyang to Beijing. -Correct. -And here I have from Beijing to Munich. Within North Korea you will not need your passports. With your guide you won't need your passport. With us you can go everywhere. But without your guide you are not allowed to leave the hotel. All this, I can show you -and we will go and visit those places. -Okay. We want to visit the Friendship Exhibition. That's a problem! -We cannot go to the Myohyang mountains. -Okay. Because three to four days ago, there was heavy rain. -Two of the main bridges collapsed. -Okay. And taking photos... As you know North Korea is in state of war! Since April we have lifted the armed truce. Therefore, now we have a cease fire. And that's why... Many things belong to the military. You cannot know which places belong to the military. Because of this, -you are not allowed to take photos. -Sure. The peculiarity of the hotel is a 360Â° rotating restaurant on the top floor. Upon our arrival, it is already 11 pm. And yet some tables are still set for up to 8 people, with food and everything. However, I don't think that anyone else is coming to dinner today. -So, what do you think? -I don't know but i'm exhausted. This arrival has left me a bit out of sorts. Nothing is like I expected it which is not bad. That we're only allowed to stay here for now is a bit annoying. I think we should get some sleep, tomorrow will be a long day. Here is the hallway... and here is a somewhat odd little room. Where you can sit face-to-face. Then when we turn around we find our bathroom. This room is pretty much like a normal hotel room. The coolest thing is that we are on the 33rd floor. There is excitement in the hotel foyer. It's the year 2013 and today is 27 July â âVictory Dayâ for North Koreans. Many international guests have come especially for the occasion to celebrate the end of the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, and ended with the signing of the ceasefire agreement. In fact, both halves of Korea are still on war footing. -Morning! -Morning! -Did you sleep well? -Yes very well, -first real sleep in a long time. -Okay... I'm afraid, we are not allowed to go outside. I can imagine. -Have you seen what's going on outside? -Everything is blocked. Do you see? Everything is shut down. We have to wait here till all representatives are through. I understand. Can we quickly grab some breakfast? No. According to reports from South Korean media, this is the first time since 1993 that Victory Day is being celebrated with a military parade. Thousands of soldiers march or drive past us in tanks. It stinks of gasoline. And also quite annoying: the loudspeaker cars that have been driving through the city for days. For us only incomprehensible slogans and North Korean marching music resound through the streets. Even days later, it still takes some time to get used to the permanent sound. In general, the military is insanely present. How many soldiers are in the Korean army? It's a huge army, right? Three hundred thousand. -Really? -Yes. Why do you grin when you say that? Our government says so. I think it's a lot. But... all the foreigners like the German, Austrian and Swiss tourists don't believe it. The European media says we have over one million soldiers. Why do you let American tourists in the country? Aren't they the enemy? -But it's about the government. -Sorry? The American government. Not the American people. But the American citizens want to visit North Korea. -That's why. -Okay. So the American people are okay, but... Yes, the people are okay, just not the government and the soldiers. But... You're saying the average North Korean has no problem with Americans? -No. -No? If a Korean knows his facial expression might be... -Reserved. -Yes. But... Usually most Koreans couldn't tell if someone is American, unless I explain it to them. But most Koreans know it's allowed for the Americans to come here by our government. Nevertheless, we met two American soldiers in the elevator of our hotel, who traveled to North Korea on the occasion of the war anniversary. We met two Americans in the elevator, and they said they were searching... For what again? For a crashed airplane, they are searching for the corpses of a crashed plane. It happened like 60 years ago. Yes, they were looking for the remains. -For their bones! -Yes, for their bones. Yes. North Koreas Military and Americas Military they made an agreement that allows these Americans to come and search for bodies from the war. But who goes with them to search for the bodies? Korean soldiers go with them. Are there still any problem regions where the government has conflicts with different ethnic groups? We don't have different ethnic groups in North Korea. -There are only North Koreans? -One nation only. -Absolutely homogenous? -Yes. We are always alone on the bus. Because we have booked an individual trip. Which means, that you always have an entire bus for yourself. Always accompanied by three guides. North Korea gets support from the World Hunger Relief Organization You know about that? Yes, is it true? -Yes, sure. -Okay. -Nearly all developing countries get help. -Okay. But they don't play a big role. I don't know where the âWorld Hunger Aidâ support takes place and what results they achieve. I don't know where the poor people live. You mean, you don't see poor people around? We quickly realized that conversations of this kind are hardly possible. If there is something that is revealing or interesting to us, it is often interrupted by the other guide. Is that just a feeling or are they not only looking out for us, but also controlling each other? One of those many questions, which of course we can't ask. At least not if we want to leave the country safely with our footage. In search of experts we find Prof. Dr. RÃ¼diger Frank. If anyone knows North Korea, it's him! People who work together with foreigners seldomly do this alone. There's always at least two of them. So they can keep an eye on each other. They also have to write reports about their encounters. The reports are then compared for accuracy. So that one is never sure if their interaction with foreigners has gone unobserved. Which makes the system very effective especially regarding self-censorship. Afterwards we drive to a photo exhibition about Kim Jong Un. Here we learn more about the military strength of North Korea. She speaks English. -Hey, how are you? -Fine, thanks and you? I'm good. So tell us a bit about the photos. -Let's start from there. -Okay. When the war broke out... we didn't have much power, but the US... they brought fifteen other countries, fifteen other following countries to the Korean war. It was a very difficult war but anyway â we smashed it! -The US? -The US. -We are really proud of it! -Obviously. It was five years after the liberation from the Japanese when the war broke out. But anyway, we smashed the US under the wise leadership of president Kim Il Sung. Without him, we can't think of victory. Our army is never weak. We have... Our army has grown up into a invincible revolution force. Who can defeat any enemy in one stroke. Comrade Kim Jong Un is most loyal to his people. He left as the general secretary of the party forever and we elected him as the first secretary of the party. So what is his duty? What does he have to do? -You know he leads our party. -Yes. In our country the party leads the Korean revolution. He leads all the Korean people and the struggle to build his driving nation. Okay. The party is very different from other parties, in its role of position. -You understand that? -Yes. -You see these people with flowers? -Yes, you were a flower girl? Yes, I was one of them. Nice. Why you were selected? Oh, cause... cause I'm good. Cause I was loyal to my job. I did everything really good, in this position. Good, nice. You like to be, that the countries come together? Yeah. It is our current and greatest wish. When do you think it can happen? Do you have any idea? I am not sure. We believe one day! One day? I hope it soon. Yes, thank you. Okay. We didn't know that either. So the North Koreans are desperate for a reunification with South Korea? But how should that be possible? We ask our guides and they take us to the South Korean border. The area between North and South Korea is the so-called DMZ. The demilitarized zone. It marks the border between the two countries. On the way to the border we hardly meet any cars. Why would we? No one can get out anyway. Or in. The demilitarized zone is a two kilometer strip of an imaginary demarcation line. That means a four kilometer strip that runs a 250 kilometers strip left and right of the border from one coast to the other. Basically, it has been set up to secure a ceasefire. Today it actually remains the border between the two Koreas as the result of the Korean War. You can drive through the DMZ at one point and drive right up to the demarcation line. There are these sky-blue buildings in which the cease fire negotiations took place from 1951 to 1953 and where today, official communications between the two countries takes place. The border runs exactly through the middle of these buildings. To create a neutral zone, enabling the two sides to speak to one another, without either side having to leave their own land. But we still don't really understand the reunification process. How exactly is that supposed to work? How do people of a socialist state with a strong leadership cult imagine a reunification with a state built on the foundations of capitalism? When South and North reunite into one country this is how we want it to be. -Sovereignty... -Sovereignty, okay. Peaceful reunification, bringing together the entire nation. One nation, one government, two systems. Two systems: socialism and capitalism. Two governments. You believe it can work? It can work. It must work. I think it can work because none will be oppressed. Everyone can preserve their property. South Korea can stay capitalist and we can still be socialist. -But both... -...will be united. -You think it can work? -Yes. Could you imagine... if you say you want a reunification, but to give up socialism? Can you imagine that? -We would not give it up. -Just hypothetical. -Just by imagination. -Just by imagination... That you say... you would reunite... but you would have to give up socialism, to be reunited. -You wouldn't do that? -No. Do you believe South Korea would give up capitalism, only to become socialist just for the reunion? Our question remains unanswered. No one else heard our conversation and our guide only made statements loyal to the regime. Nevertheless, there is a new guide for us in the evening. We can only assume that the former guide has decided to avoid us. Kind of weird, over time, we developed closer relationships with our guides. So we also get personal about some things. For example, I am interested in whether it's not exhausting to be constantly on the road with tourists for periods of up to two weeks â without coming home in between. One of them talks about his broken marriage and that the job suits him. Another one tells me about his four-year-old daughter, whom he misses and who likes Disney just like my niece. Actually the same topics as we know from home. And through which we get a personal insight into people's everyday lives. It is estimated that the US Air Force dropped around 450.000 tons of bombs and more than 30.000 tons of napalm over North Korea. During the war, almost 90% of Pyongyang was destroyed. This is naturally reflected in today's cityscape. As Berliners, we are familiar with socialist architecture. Nevertheless, Pyongyang somehow looks as if the architecture of the 70's had been combined with visions from science fiction. At first glance, we do not see a clear social infrastructure. Almost completely indiscernible without our guides. Something we wouldn't normally have. Back in Berlin we look for someone who can help us and find the graduate engineer Dr. Philipp Meuser. Architect and publisher of the âArchitectural Guide of Pyongyangâ. Pyongyang was an old, homogeneous city before the Korean War. What happened is that after the war, Tabula rasa was made. The old structure was completely demolished. The state has access to land and ownership does not matter at all. Urban planners think to themselves: âThat's great, finally I can do what I always wanted to do.â Realize utopias. And of course, that's what happened there. Narrow, winding alleys were replaced by wide main roads, by modern multi-story buildings. The architecture is inseparably interwoven with ideological goals. When Pyongyang was re-planning, it oriented itself on the axis of the Taedong River. Everywhere visual axes were created to connect the most important monuments. The most important axis connects the bronze monument on Mansu hill with the memorial in honor of the founding of the party. In addition to the recognizable road axes, the Sungri road forms the most representative main artery of the city. It unites a large portion of the important state buildings. Along the triumphal arch, it leads to Mansu Hill directly to Kim Il Sung Square. The Kim-Il Sung Square is the urban and symbolic center of Pyongyang. From here, the optical connection to the municipalities on the eastern riverbank is established. The monument to the Juche ideology forms the urban development center of East Pyongyang. Another important component to the cityscape is the cult of personality around the Kim family. Again and again we see portraits, statues or life-size wax figures of the leaders. Ever bow to a statue in a parka? The visit to the great monument on Mansu Hill is an absolute highlight. More precisely, these two bronze statues are over 20 meters high. Of course, all visits are based on a strict principle. Obligatory is the deep bow. We save ourselves the trouble of questioning it and go along with everything that is asked from us. We don't want to be watched more closely. It is highly illegal to film against the knowledge of the guides. -Don't point with your finger! -Okay. Gregor, please put the flowers there and then come back to us -to show our respect to the leader. -Okay. You also put down a bunch of flowers each time, in addition to the bow. Often pink or red orchids. Later we can see how the plastic-flowers are brought back to the market for resale. Next they show us the Kim Il Sung Place. It serves as a parade square. With 75.000 square meters it's an incredibly large, open space, right in the middle of the city. On the ground we find many small white dots and numbers. They serve as orientation for participants of mass events. If you look over the Taedong River, you will see a tower: The Monument of the Juche Ideology. The 170 meter high tower was built to commemorate the merits of Kim Il Sung. Who founded the Juche ideology in the fifties. By now, Juche is a kind of religion in North Korea, and the deceased rulers are worshiped like saints. It is firmly anchored in the North Korean system and thus also eponymous for the Juche calendar. Whose numbered years begin with the year of the birth of Kim Il Sung. Which god do you believe in? -In myself. -Religion I mean. -In myself. -Yes. In myself. -So you do not believe in any god? -No. And about you? I am actually a Christian. But probably not the best Christian out there. Most foreigners believe in Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, various kinds... In our country we believe in the Juche idea. Okay. In our country the Juche idea is a sort of religion. But really, it's not our religion, it is our man! We believe in man. -Have you read some of them? -Many of them. During the university we study that as a subject. -As a subject. -Okay. Okay, so what does it say here? âOur socialist is the one, that... that initiate the Juche idea.â Our socialist means our own socialism. It is man-centered socialism. It is the Juche idea: man is the owner of everything. The man decides everything, This is the Juche idea. You can't ask that! All Korean people love him. Maybe if you ask that to another person they will get angry! -Don't ask that! -Okay! So is he the most intelligent man in the world? -Yes. We think that. -Okay. -So these are all books he wrote? -Yes, everything he wrote. It's a lot of books. How many books did he write? Maybe here that number is shown? No there is no number... Too many, many, many. I can't remember. We have a similar history. Your country and our country. Our country, it's very difficult Because of several issues between North Korea and South Korea... What issues? What do you mean? I don't know, it's sort of politics. I'm not interested in politics. The economy with the ideal. -The ideal is very different. -Yes. -South Korean is capitalist. -Yes. They are only think of money. But in our country it's no capitalism, it's socialism. We only think of our man. Our leader, our party. They don't care who is president. They don't care at all. They only think about money. So the ideal is very different and the economy is also different. They maybe have developed the economy in South Korea and their living standard is much higher than ours. -You think so, it's higher? -Yes, I think so. -How do you know? -I think... We've learned, we've learned. But... in the past times, we've learned that South Korea is rather poor and not developed. But after maybe ten years later, they developed much and what TV news and some foreigners said that South Korea is rather developed, regarding Economy. But they depend on other countries economies, especially the US economy. But our country has a self reliance economy. Developed by ourselves. Our goods are not good. Sometimes it's rather rough, but we love ours, because it was made by ourself. But they don't have that. So for example the US, they cut the line of the national economy, but they can't develop themselves. Okay. So we're proud of us! -Thank you for your cooperation. -Thank you very much. Thanks for all the informations. Thank you. Sorry for my poor english. -Your english is great. -Thank you. -No, seriously. -Bye. After a few days we notice how the constant propaganda does not pass over us without leaving a mark. The strict program of discussions, information and impressions being presented leaves us hardly time to think. Our next destination is the cemetery of the Revolutionary Heroes. In the cemetery, famous personalities are paid honor to. For example, here is the tomb of Kim Il Song's first wife and Kim Jong Il's mother: Kim Jong Suk. -What are we supposed to do? -Buying flowers. Okay. And then? Placing them up on the tomb of the unknown soldier. Okay. Thank you! Gamsahamnida! Gamsihammdamm. Gamsaham... Gamsa-hamdi-am. I have it now too: Gamsahamnidam. Gamsahamnida. Gamsahamnida. I thought there was an ânâ at the end? Right? Gamsahamnida. So you place two larger bouquets there and one at the top. Then after you've set the flowers down, then we have a mourning minute. But not a minute just a few seconds. -So please, this and this... -On the upper staircase, right? -Yes. -Okay. -And then come back here. -Yes. Many of the people buried here are war heroes who were martyred. Back then Korea was a Japanese colony and... this man was betrayed by a Korean traitor and was arrested. He died in prison, because he bit off his own tongue instead of talking. But the Japanese did not try to save his life. So he bled to death. Courageous. Also this time there is no time to delve into with the many stories. Our next stop though, is one of the most exciting stops of the entire journey. The rush is great. The excitement can be felt everywhere. A North Korean is â visibly against his will led away by two soldiers. But no time to go into it further. It's on. ARIRANG! A more impressive artistic display I have never seen before or since. More than 100.000 persons take part in this dance and gymnastics show. The background is like a mosaic â thousands of children hold up colorful cardboard cards and turn them over with lightning precision to form various pictures. The Arirang Festival takes place in the First of May Stadium. With 114.000 seats, it is the largest stadium in the world. Arirang is one of the most incredible events I have ever seen! How is it possible that everyone participates in such an act? We ask our guides where to begin in North Korea to make such events a success? To answer our question, they take us to the Pyongyang Students Palace the the next day. It is a kind of educational institution. These can be found everywhere in North Korea. The student palace has space for around 4.000 students and thus plays not an insignificant role with children and young people in North Korea. We stop by various classrooms where groups of children are already expecting us. Music, sports, dance, handcraft â The children â some of whom are still quite young â amaze with their impressively advanced skills. I wonder if I could have achieved so much perfection at that age? And what effort would it take to be able to show this perfection at that age? At least now I understand a little better what motivates an individual to be part of a huge mosaic for several hours. Another station is the flower show. It is located in the Kim-il-sungi-je-Kim-jong-ilie exhibition hall. Yes, exactly. The Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia Exhibition Hall. Prevalent in all the state propaganda there is an element we find everywhere, and that is the embodiment of the ruler in the form of flowers. These are breeds of botanicals from outside North Korea, donated to the people of North Korea. This becomes an attempt to embody the ruler into something that will survive over many generations, so that the ruler is omnipresent. There are flower exhibitions, with loral competitions: âWho has the most beautiful Kimilsungia?â The hall is named after the orchid âKim Ill Sungiaâ and the begonia âKim Jong Iliaâ. The entire hall is filled with flowers arranged to form picturesque scenes. These are combined with photographs of the rulers or models of missiles and nuclear bombs. What else? This exhibition hall consist of three halls and this is the central hall. -Now we go upstairs. -Okay. Our master Kim Jong-un was selected to be the most famous President in the world. Okay, I didn't know that. Who selected him? -By the people in the United States. -Okay. Interesting. They could not win the war. Do you know why? It's because of him. It's because of his outstanding strategies and tactics, and his belief in all our soldiers. As well as our soldiers, who paid back to his love, -with their lives. -Okay. -And this one? -It says celebration. -And 60th anniversary of the victory. -Ah okay, nice! He is the hero and the son of our nation. -That's it? -Yes. And Kim Ill Sungia and Kim Jong-Ilia won two gold medals. At the horticulture Exhibition in China in 2006 and 2011. And Kim Jong-ill won a lot of gold medals. -Let me tell you? -Yes. Kim Jong-ill won a special prize and golden medal in Czechoslovakia, they hold a international flower show in 1991. He won a special prize and golden medal. In 1999, Kunming in China they hold the horticulture exhibition and he won the special price, -grand medal. -Okay. So that religiously worshipped figure in the form of a flower can be raised anywhere, on a balcony, in a factory, in schools. The people can identify with it. On the other side, this flower is not only as physical flower, it also works on posters or other forms of propaganda elements, which are also present everywhere in the society. One of the last destinations on our journey is the Great Study Hall of the People. It is referred as âThe Learning Centerâ. We are told that everyone can come here in their free time. The system is probably comparable to those of the german adult education centers. According to North Korean media, it houses over thirty million books. Including a variety of writings and music from abroad. We are invited to take part in a German class. In this class there are many lectures. -For example, we have a german class too. -Okay. The german class students study german, now. -I will show you. -That would be great. Maybe we can even talk to them. -German lecture. -Okay. Good Morning. Can we join you? Sure, we are just taking a break. Please. -Please have a seat. -Okay. I am Philipp and this is Gregor. Sarang hae yo. I love you. He said, he would like to learn more about the âHofbrÃ¤uhausâ. Then he's not the right person to ask. He comes from Munich! That's the Royal Court Brewery in Munich, in the centre of city. It's a gigantic hall, a really big hall, with long tables, like the one here. There people sit and drink beer and listen to music. They have big glasses â have you seen pictures? -Oh yeah! -Yeah, big glasses. One liter. It hurts your hand to lift it. Men are only allowed to hold it with one hand. I understand most of it. -But one question... -Yes? What is âKu'dammâ? That is the short form, a slang for the word âKurfÃ¼rstendammâ. -I'll write it down for you, alright? -Yes. Just right here? Okay... It's written... That is the biggest street in Berlin, where you can go shopping. -Yes, shopping mile. -Exactly. The short form is âKu'dammâ. When can I come to Berlin? I hope soon. I hope very, very soon, sure. -I hope to see you soon. -Exactly. I hope to see you soon again. Exactly. -Do you have a family? -Yes. -How many people are in your family? -I have an older sister, a mother, a father and also still one grandmother. So to live with your grandmother, parents and children, how does that work? Actually pretty good! You guys speak very well for taken German only for six months. When I think about learning Korean for only six months... I could speak six words! Good bye. Thank you very much. -Bye. -Bye. Thanks. Take care. -Bye. -Bye. -I hope we see each other again! -I hope so too. Here, in Berlin or anywhere in Germany. Bye. Bye. In moments like these, I'm not sure what to think. I mean, does he really think we'll see each other again? If so, how does he imagine it happening? Somehow the situation makes me sad. Well... The large study hall of the people is the last stop on our journey. Afterwards we are off to the airport. We quickly realized that it's difficult to get an objective picture of the country. Instead, we see a country of staged superlatives. We asked a lot of questions but listened much more often. We were seldom able to choose the topics. Probably the reason that we arrived with many questions, but we flew home with many of them unanswered though. Of course, our experience is only scratching the surface of what the North Korean people are experiencing. Nevertheless, I came one step closer to an answer. I developed a sense of what it means to live in a totalitarian state. The feeling, when you cannot freely express your opinion and instead play along for fear of the enormous consequences. For my part, I'm relieved when I'm on the plane and I know that my constant filming can no longer bring consequences. What remains is a journey full of contrasts. The impressions are deep and won't let me go throughout the following week. It was an exciting journey. Nevertheless, I assumed that, I will not travel to North Korea again anytime soon. ...until I found out, you can run a Marathon in Pyongyang! After all, I just run to Las Vegas through the desert all the way from LA. Running is my thing. So why not run a Marathon in Pyongyang? It's the only way to walk through town without the accompaniment of a guide! Also this year our entry is endangered. This time, through the escalating conflict between North Korea and the United States. The last news we caught before we left was marked by aggressive posturing by both powers So we let ourselves register with the crisis provision list of the Federal Foreign Office. Together with four friends, we left from Vladivostok to Pyongyang on the 7th of April, 2017. We're finally about to board the flight to Pyongyang, North Korea. The tension mounts. We are told that the airline has only four planes. Probably the reason for our nine-hour delay. It's now 8pm, we are waiting on our plane which is right over there. We'll hopefully land in Pyongyang in one and a half hours. It's two nights before the start of the Marathon, which is the most important night for me. Now we're trying to shake off the jet lag from the flight to Vladivostok, a time difference of eight hours. But all good. The state airline of North Korea is called Air Koryo. With the exception of two airplanes, operation in the European Union is prohibited for safety reasons. From the look of the plane we fly to Pyongyang â I can see why. I've only known such aircraft from museums. The interior seems to be the original from 1960s. Upon our arrival, we get to know our two guardians for the coming week. This is the second time for you in our country? We have been here for the 60 years celebration of the Korean wars. We really liked it. Since our visit in 2013, a lot has changed. New residential areas have emerged and Pyongyang is no longer completely in the dark. At least not on the days for the marathon. That's a new skyscraper there, right? Wow! It's huge. The one with the lights in the back? Very beautiful. Back to the Koryo Hotel... Like on our first trip, the modalities will be discussed first. Why don't we sit down and talk about the program? Yes, you are right. Full marathon runners will start and after five minutes half marathon and ten kilometers runners will start. And what time are we going to leave the hotel on sunday morning? Sunday morning we leave at 6:40 am. And then we go to the statues of the leaders to show your respect to our leaders. -The bronze statues we saw? -Yes, the bronze statues. And the we'll go to the Kim Il Sung Square where the military parades and mass dancing takes place. Do you have a wheelchair for me for sunday to do this after the marathon? -That's right in the afternoon. -That's why I'm asking. -Which floor do we stay? Seventh? -Third, no? -What is our floor? -Thirty-three! -33rd floor. -33rd floor? Building number 2. 33rd floor and I think room number was 27. I think we stayed here last time. Really? Good memory! I think so. -It could be. -Yeah, it could be. -Good night! -Good night! Good night. Afterwards, as it was four years ago, it's back to the thirty-third floor â and back to the exact same room. I cannot get rid of the feeling that there are no such coincidences in North Korea. During our first night in the hotel, I realize that I am rapidly getting sick. Something I ate in the last 24 hours appears not to be agreeing with me. Nevertheless, I visit together with the others the Pyongyang subway system. The deepest mass transit network in the world. In Pyongyang a subway ride is a highlight for every Berliner. At the end of the 1990s, several trains from the Berlin underground were sold to North Korea and are still in use today. Already on the escalator one notices a pleasant difference a pleasant difference to our train stations at home: The total lack of advertising. Nothing screaming for you to buy. Wherever advertising posters would normally hang, instead there are elaborately designed mosaics on the walls. But the colorful motifs are rich in propaganda. In addition to the portraits of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il, everything inside is just as it used to be. Even the scratch marks of Berlin graffiti artists can still be found on the windowpanes. The route network, created at the end of the 1960's, is supposed to have around 30 stations. These in turn should in part be provided with integrated escape tunnels. We do not notice any evidence of this. During our visit to the subway, my health is rapidly declining. On the escalator I hit rock bottom for the first time. I need to go immediately back to the hotel. Unfortunately I woke up this morning and after breakfast I began having massive stomach problems. It started when we visited the subway, when I couldn't hold it back anymore. It's some kind of stomach flu, virus or whatever. The problem is, I'm supposed to run a Marathon tomorrow. I'll wait until tomorrow morning, it can't really go on like this. Hopefully I will get better overnight. It is the 12th April 2017 and the 4th Marathon in Pyongyang where foreigners are allowed to participate. This year it is a special marathon. Instead of the previous four times ten-kilometer rounds around the Kim-Il Sung Stadium. It is now for the first time across the city and at kilometer 21 back again. Due to my state of health, my stomach is empty and my fluids are anything but topped up. I've felt better before... But I'll try my luck, maybe I'll make it, or at least run a half Marathon. Similar to what is permitted at special locations, filming is now also allowed at certain events. In general however, the rule has not eased. This year the prohibition of taking photos out of the moving bus is even more controlled. I enter the Kim Il Sung Stadium for the first time. 40.000 people are there to watch and cheer on the athletes. It's time. Yesterday at this time I was laid out in the bathroom. Today after three bananas and a little toast, I'm ready to give it a try. Let's see how far I get. From the stadium, the route goes past the victory arch. The people on the roadside cheer for the runners. I can only guess who was ordered as a spectator to the roadside and who is here voluntarily. All that matters to me right now is that I feel supported. In North Korea very many things are staged, you notice this from time to time as a visitor. Interesting is the question of whether or not this should be considered wrong, for the people and also the leaders. They see their participation as part of the âtotal packageâ and want to make sure that the runners are not running through an empty city, they want the runners to be seeing people cheering for them. We take it as a deception, of course. I believe in the reality though, from the point of view of the North Korean, it's a bit of both. Kilometer seven. It's going okay. Our guardian tells us that all runners who need more than four hours will be picked up by a yellow bus. Kilometer 16 is behind me... I'm pretty... surprised, that I can run at all. Twelve kilometers to go. Oh, I'm dead! From kilometer 30 all water stocks are empty. As the runners of the ten-kilometer run and the half-marathon run the same distance, is this my last water bottle that I get for the rest of the track. Kilometer 41. I made it. That was a hard fight. But anyway... I don't feel my legs anymore, it's kilometer 41 I'm almost at the stadium... and nothing can stop me anymore. At the finish, it feels like I'm drying out from the inside. Even at the finish, there's no water. I'll pay for that later! I spend the rest of the trip in bed with a fever. You are crazy. They just don't have any water anymore. Not here, not on the track. -They're sadistic. -We're getting you water right now. Normally after a Marathon I would relax and do something good for my body â especially this time. But as in 2013, our 2017 trip is also an overload of information and sightseeing stops. -Exhausted? -Yes, my legs, as you can imagine. Especially after yesterday, because usually I would eat a lot the day before. But yesterday this was not possible. So I had to go the the start without energy. -So this was really a war. -Yes. So instead of driving back to our hotel, we had already packed our bags the evening before to set out on a planned four-hour drive across the country. The roads are full of potholes. During our journey, we often bump our heads in the bus or slam against the window while sleeping. It quickly becomes a running gag with our guides. In general, we have great luck with our guides in 2017 as we did in 2013. We can talk about lots of things halfway openly and have plenty of situations where we have a lot of fun together. Our destination is the Masik-yong Ski Resort, just off the east coast of North Korea. Its modern hotel is part of North Korea's only ski resort. Now we're going to see the breakfast room of our bobsled cabin hotel. The interior design is inspired by alpine ski huts. Arriving at the hotel, we notice that my Marathon medal is dated 2016. And also with our two ten-kilometer-runners they made a mistake: Although they had reached the finish together, they were presented with two completely different times on their certificates. In the evening we go to a restaurant across the street where we eat Korean barbecue. After a few bottles of soju and a really nice dinner, we ask our guides and hotel staff if they would sing karaoke for us. Arirang is the name of a Korean Folk Song. It's about a young woman who sings to her lover and wishes that he will soon come home, which is actually a very common theme. But of course the emphasis is on the sadness of separation between these two sides. The concept is used today , especially in North Korea, to underline the situation on the Korean peninsula. The Arirang then is used to build a togetherness between the two countries on the basis of nationalism. Arirang is for North- and South Korea of great importance. At the Winter Olympics 2018 in Pyeongchang both sport-teams from North-and South Korea used it at the same anthem. Not for nothing is one of the largest South Korean TV stations called Arirang TV. Also the Arirang North Korean Gymnastics Festival, which we visited in 2013, named after this song. Besides the sports offerings such as the Marathon or the Ski Resort we are interested in how North Koreans spend their free time. According to our guides the shooting range is prized as a popular leisure destination. In contrast to most of the places we visited, there is not march music here. Thankfully, because it's a little bit exhausting all the time. Instead parade videos and speeches with Kim Jong Un. Even though we don't understand anything it's at least a bit of a change to the entertainment program. The Kwangbok supermarket gives us an insight into a small percentage of the North Korean population. This is one of three supermarkets selling international products. Mostly products from Thailand and China. You can only pay with Won, the North Korean currency. Kind of surprising, because otherwise we pay everywhere with Euro or Dollar, not in the North Korean currency won. In addition to the supermarket, some other things in the country seem to have changed too. Of course, we can only speak for the exteriors. For example, in the cityscape: In 2013, many houses were gray and covered in mold, we find these now freshly painted in peach and turquoise. The people in Pyongyang are wearing more and more colorful clothing and we also see more international sports brands. Our larger and varied portions of food also lead to the impression that since 2013 a change has taking place. Even American products have found their way onto the North Korean market. North Korea is a country that is in no way static, there seems to be some change, under Kim Jong Un, much new construction has taken place. The number of restaurants in Pyongyang and elsewhere has risen dramatically, and we see other businesses such as car washes, which did not exist before. The number of petrol stations has grown, traffic lights have appeared where before the traffic police have stood. Now there are more cars and also traffic lights. North Korea has experienced a modest boom that has mostly concentrated itself around Pyongyang, but surely the country that Kim Jong Un wants to show is continually doing better under his leadership. Not everything we saw in North Korea was bad. Much was concerning but also beautiful. Some things were too good to be true. You feel the tension and hear the unsaid. Sometimes it felt very personal and intimate. Is it because we travelled together all the time or because I just liked my guides as people regardless of a regime or world view? I am glad to have captured my own picture of the country
