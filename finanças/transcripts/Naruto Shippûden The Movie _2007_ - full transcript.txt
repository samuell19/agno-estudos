Why you... Clone Tackle! I will not die! Too slow! An eye? Naruto! Uzumaki Naruto ls everything destined? NARUTO SHIPPUDEN THE MOVIE The moment has arrived. It is for this night that we developed the Dark Medical Ninjutsu. With it, we shall reawaken Moryo and unite all the lands. Prescription... Chakra infusion! Prescription filled. Intruder! You intend to fight us? Do it! Gitai! Setsuna! Fire Style Ninja Technique, Fire Run! Do not flinch at meagre flames like these! Wind Style Ninja Technique, Divine Wind! The time has finally come. Wait here. From here on lies the boundary between the world of the living and the dead. Only I, the one with the name "Yomi," can enter. Over there... It waits... It is waiting! Moryo! Commence jutsu rite! Min, Shin, Gan, Reppyou, Shouzen, Mika, Dan, Raku, Shou! It's been a while... Have I returned to this world? Master Moryo, it has been a long time. You are... Have you forgotten? It is I, Yomi. Yomi... I am a survivor of the shinobi clan, which used your powers to create the Ghost Army. Why have you summoned me? The stars have orbited. Now is the time for us to join hands once more to create a Thousand-Year Kingdom. But, where is my physical self? With only my soul, I will fade away in no time... Please use my body as your vessel. With my dark medical skills, I shall transfer your soul into my body. Commence surgery! Now! Please enter my body! Very well... Jutsu rite complete. Arise! My army! Rise! First, we head to the shrine where Master Moryo's body is sealed. Before that, there is a foe you must destroy. Bring down the Priestess of the Land of Ogres. Only she possesses the power to seal me away. I understand. Yes. When l am completely resurrected, l shall annihilate the Five Great Nations and establish one sole Thousand-Year Kingdom to rule over the world. Hey! What is that? Enemy attack! Everyone, take your positions! Aim! Fire! It has no effect on them! Maintain positions. Do not let them pass! We must notify His Highness about this emergency with the utmost haste. We received this message late last night. Moryo, who had been sealed in an underground palace has been revived by an unknown offender. And the Ghost Army is on the march. We will cooperate with the other nations to deal with this situation. Be careful now. Bye! Oh, dear, how did you end up there? Don't move! You can feel the seriousness of the situation. My arm's itching to fight! Naruto! What are you doing? Team 7's been called up, too! Right! Our favourite hero's about to make his appearance! What's going on here? Why? Why? Why? Why are Bushy Brow and Neji here? Where's Kakashi Sensei? Lee is Sasuke's replacement. I look forward to working with you! Sasuke... Lady Tsunade... Sasuke Uchiha's name is... They're not over it yet? Then what about Neji? He's Kakashi's stand-in. Kakashi and Guy have met up with the intercepting force and are now headed for the battlefront. Neji will be the captain of Team 7. Why him? Neji is a jounin. Furthermore, in this group, the only one who is still a genin is... Naruto, you alone. That's how it is. Well then, I'll just get out on the battlefront and beat the crap out of the enemy! Team 7 will not be on the battlefront. Your mission is to guard the VIP. Why? Stop complaining and listen to her explanation! OK. For several days now since the incident, the enemy has been on the move, laying to waste each region it passes. It is known that this Ghost Army is a type of puppet jutsu. In other words, they're lifeless dolls being manipulated by someone? Yes. Then why don't we just bring down whoever's controlling them? The one controlling them is not a human. Known as Moryo, it is a demon from another world. I hate scary stories like that. There was a ninja who once tried to conquer the continent. He utilised the power of the demon Moryo and raised an invulnerable army. Moryo led the army, devastating one country after another, and drove the continent to the brink of destruction. And that is the identity of the Ghost Army that is terrorising the world today. Back then Miroku, a priestess from the Land of Ogres used a powerful ninjutsu to seal off Moryo's soul in an underground palace in the Land of Ogres, and its physical body in a shrine in the Land of Swamps and averted the disaster. Now resurrected, Moryo has left the Land of Ogres with his Ghost Army and is now advancing towards the Sealing Shrine. lf Moryo's soul and physical body become one and he is completely resurrected, the situation will be irreparable. What'll happen? The world will be destroyed. The priestess from the Land of Ogres must be escorted to the shrine where the body is sealed, and Moryo's soul must be sealed. That is the only way to save the world. Listen up. The mission we have been assigned is to provide absolute security for the VIP. Sakura, stay with our charge at all times. Yes, sir. If anything should happen to our charge, there may be a need for emergency medical care. Got it. Lee! Your role is to intercept the enemy. Roger! We can make no assumptions about the enemy in this existing situation, so your taijutsu, which has no special chakra characteristics, works to our advantage. Leave it to me! I'll protect you all through sheer will! Let's set out. Hey, wait a minute! Isn't there anything for me to do? Yourjob is the same as Lee. To intercept the enemy. All right! If the enemy appears, I'll thrash him and send him to the depths of hell! Your body's got bigger, but inside, everything's the same as two and a half years ago. What? I've heard that you've got stronger under Master Jiraiya's tutelage. However, as for teamwork, which is developed through experience, you're still a genin. Listen up. Do not forget that our mission is strictly as bodyguards. Do not stray far from our charge. Sheesh! Neji is the team captain. All right? Yes! Let's do our best with teamwork, the Leaf style! Yeah, yeah. Just answer once! Will he be all right? Neji with his Byakugan is adept at data gathering. Since becoming a jounin, he's honed his ability to make calm, sound judgements and he's good on defence. He is most suited to protecting a VIP. I'm not worried about Neji, Lee or Sakura. Naruto... He failed guard-type jutsu classes. Even if he trained with Master Jiraiya, ultimately that was to improve his individual skills. There are things you can't learn just by training. He never gives up, no matter what. His persistence is a formidable power. This is a mission they cannot fail. Where are you, my foursome? Right before you. Head immediately for the Land of Ogres. Kill the priestess, who passes on the Sealing Jutsu. As you wish. Take this with you. You are the only one who can manipulate this. Go. Hurry. Susuki. Time to switch. Do me a favour and let me continue. You haven't slept in three days. Go back to quarters and get some sleep. That's an order. All right, I'll leave it to you. Brother, hurry it up. No need to feel rushed. It's working! Each of our chakra natures is as discussed earlier. Let's go and do it! Don't fail! What... this? Alert! Alert! Go! Tighten the guard around the sleeping quarters! Susuki? Susuki! Wait! You must not go! Lady Shion has had a precognition, hasn't she? No matter. If I can give my life to save hers, I will be honoured! I am entering! Lady Shion, we have intruders! Please prepare to escape! There you are! Lady Shion! Taruho! Take care of Lady Shion... The life of that priestess is ours. Hold it! I won't let that happen. What was that? He didn't even try to hide his presence. Rather, he loudly announced his arrival. Is he a big-shot like us? That, or he's really stupid. Well, either way, he's no ordinary guy. No, he doesn't look like it. What did you say? All right! This is as far as you guys go! You think you're gonna stop us all by yourself? Naruto Uzumaki is here. And I won't let you have your way! Multiple Shadow Clone Technique! This many Shadow Clones? He really isn't ordinary! Well? Are you scared now? Gitai, Setsuna, Shizuku! Earth, Fire, and Wind Combo Jutsu, now! Aye-aye! Earth Style. Earth Corridor! Damn it! We're locked inside a dirt wall? Search for an exit! -The exit is over here. -Found it! -I'll leave him to you. -This way! Fire Style. Fire Run! What? I've never seen such a weak Fire Jutsu. Wind Style, Divine Down Current! That Naruto, he disobeys my order and look what happens? The priestess is in the waterfall deep inside the sanctuary. One foe is already closing in. I'll take care of him. You two put a stop to that, then come to the waterfall! -Roger! -Roger! Close! Not even a single bone will be left after getting hit by this jutsu. Leaf Hurricane! Are you with that earlier guy? Retreat! Hold it! Brother, I want more chakra. I think we used up too much for that combo jutsu earlier. All right, go find Brother Kusuna. Aye-aye. This way. Eight Trigrams Air Palm! Brother! We need to replenish chakra! All right! Scatter! Pesky bastards! We can't replenish like this! Without chakra, we can't win. All right, we retreat for now. Please do not fear. I am from the Hidden Leaf Village. Hidden Leaf... It... What's the matter, Lady Shion? It... ..is trying to resurrect itself, once again. This is Lady Shion, Priestess of the Land of Ogres. I am Neji Hyuga, leader of Team 7 from the Hidden Leaf Village. I'm Rock Lee. I'm Sakura Haruno. I'm Naruto Uzumaki. How's it going? We will escort Lady Shion to the Sealing Shrine. -What're you doing? -Don't make me look rude... -As a result of last night's assault... -..in front of them. -..many lost their lives. -But... Be quiet! And just as in her precognition, Susuki was among them. That's right. And here I am, safe and sound. They must have no regrets. Hey, wait! They all died for your sake! So what's with that attitude of yours? Hey, Naruto, stop! Sit quietly! What? Is there something on my face? You are going to die. What did you say? I can't hear in such a quiet voice. Say it out loud! You... Shortly, you will be pierced in the chest and die! What? Why do we have to baby-sit someone like her? Please forgive her. Lady Shion often has precognitions about people's deaths. Precognitions? But please do not let it bother you. I get it. And she's always wrong, huh? No, until today, she has been correct 100% of the time. You see? Precognitions are never right... -100% means she's absolutely right? -Yes. You just said not to let it bother me! I meant it's useless to let it bother you. Is that supposed to make him feel better? What's so bad, Naruto? Try dying once. Then perhaps your stupidity will be cured. Sakura! No way! I don't believe in precognitions at all! I'm going to become the Hokage! No way will I die before that! Hidden Leaf Ninja teams ambushed the Ghost Army many times and attempted to destroy them in a single stroke. However, it has stood unfazed and continues to march towards the Sealing Shrine. As suspected, the only one who can stop them is the Priestess Shion of the Land of Ogres and her Sealing Jutsu... We will escort Lady Shion safely to the Sealing Shrine! Only those who are willing to give their lives for this need accompany us! Are you ready? I am going! Let me come, too! I will go! This is ridiculous! How much more time are they going to waste? Sir Taruho insists on taking more men and wants us to wait until all preparations are made. At a time when every minute counts? Look! The sharpest spear couldn't pierce through me now! Naruto, it's pitiful if you're letting what the priestess said shake you. You're wrong! I'll bet you're all worried for me since you heard that I was gonna die. Right? That's why I wanted to calm your fears. The world could be on the verge of destruction! We have no time to worry about you! Naruto! This is the time to give your life to protect someone very precious! I know. And that's why I'm gonna easily change this silly prediction and save the world! With this! My precognitions cannot be changed! You? Here's a new precognition. You will be beheaded and die. Beheaded... Well then, how's this? Keep it up until you die. You, shinobi. I am ready to depart. Follow me. Hey wait! I can't get up! Cripes! Naruto, are you OK? I thought I was gonna die. It's a dead end! This is the waterfall where priestesses purify themselves. Inside it is an escape route. Are you sure about leaving without Sir Taruho? I am the priestess of this land. It's my choice whether to leave my attendants or not. Your back is so uncomfortable. You should try to keep your body more feminine. Damn it! Who's out there? Taruho! What's the big idea? No matter when or where, it is my duty to keep an eye on you. You're just a burden! Go back to the country! -I will not. -Go home! I will not. Go home, I said! I will not. l don't see any signs of the enemy. We'll camp out here. But I thought there was no time to lose? If it were just us, we could continue to run several more days, but... The other two have reached their limits. I'm fine! Lady Shion, your Sealing Jutsu relies on your physical stamina. You must get ample rest tonight. I'm hungry. Prepare my meal! She's acting like a spoiled brat again. The soup is cold! I can't eat this! Nor this! I sort of like this. Me too. My deepest apologies. Putting a bonfire is like giving the enemy your location, so... I'm turning in! Here. We'll be running again all day. Eat or your body won't hold up. Thank you. Say, about those predictions... Lady Shion foresees the deaths of only those who attend to her. And you can't avoid it, even if you know how you're supposed to die? No. No matter what measures you take, you cannot change the fact that death is imminent. But Lady Shion's predictions involved only those who were honoured to die for her. If they had defied her predictions and lived, Lady Shion would probably have died. Lately, even though they are citizens of our land, there are those who fear Lady Shion's precognitions, going so far as to avoid her. Whether her precognitions would continue to be correct or not, perhaps it will depend on the ones who were in her visions. I see. She must be lonely. And that's why she acts so spoiled. It's very sad. But what about you, Taruho? What if she tells you you're going to die? My family is deeply indebted to Lady Shion's mother. If we can repay her by protecting Lady Shion, I would gladly give my life. As long as my feelings don't change, my destiny will not change. All right! Hey, Taruho! Let's go! She's such a brat because of the way she grew up. l guess l should be nicer to her. Hey, good morning! -Taruho. -Yes. I don't need you. Go back home. I cannot leave your side, Lady Shion. You're just a burden! She's just a stupid priestess, after all! Stop acting like such a brat! Do you even understand how far Taruho goes to protect you? You've had a precognition, haven't you? It's all right. Please tell me honestly. When my pulse rages and I hear the high pitch of the bell, I have visions of the future. Last night, I heard the bell and saw your future. If you continue to accompany me, Taruho, you will die. Watch out! Stop! I'm going to fall! Put me down! Put me down! Let go, you fool! I've had enough! Going through such a dangerous path! Are you really trying to protect me? There must be another path! Shall we change our route? No. Even here in the Land of Swamps, this route has many fresh springs. The enemy's combo attacks are based on the Fire Style. I see. So even if they attack with a Fire Jutsu, we'll able to counter it with the water here. Lady Shion, once we get past this place, the Sealing Shrine will be very close. Please endure this a bit longer. For this mission, we must wait for the enemy to attack. Be on guard and do not take individual initiatives. -Especially you, Naruto. -I know that! By the way, what is this indie visual ini-whatever? Is your comrade an idiot? Yes. What is that? A water dragon! And a big one, too! They're attacking with water, not fire! You were completely off the mark! Never mind that. Hurry! Get up to higher ground! We already figured you would go further in. We don't know which way they're coming from. Protect Lady Shion. Goodness! All that talk about water being plentiful and to our advantage! If this is what we get from Neji, whom I thought was the most sensible, I fear for what's ahead! There must be someone nearby who is controlling the water dragon. Byakugan! There! Two of them on the top of the ridge! lf l remember correctly, when he attacked the Land of Ogres he used Fire Style Chakra. lt's not unusual for a jounin to be able to control different chakra. But l didn't detect any Water Style natures from the chakra spiralling out from his chakra points. So they're on top of the ridge on the other side... No! Do not move from here! Why? They're the ones controlling the dragon, right? I'm going! Wait, Naruto! I can't let Naruto go alone! I'm going, too! Lee! Those guys! We have no choice but to let them handle it... The Bushy Brow and the idiot... Two are headed this way. Well, that makes it easier for us. Here they come. Seems like it. You go for that taijutsu user. I'll handle the one in orange, the Shadow Clone user. Got it? I could handle both of them by myself. -There! -It's coming. Why you... The jutsu is broken. Probably Naruto and Lee... Naruto! What is this? I'm going to be your opponent! We'll see just how much your fists can withstand. -Lady Shion. -What is it? I must ask you to go to sleep for a while. While Naruto and Lee are covering for us, we'll leave this valley. Fighting while falling back is the most dangerous mission. -I'm counting on you. -Yes, sir! Water Style, Surface Slicer! Are you trying to use all the trees and rocks as a shield? What a carefree fellow you are! I get it! You think it's better to escape upwards! Well, I really like that! Damn it! Multiple Shadow Clones! Why you... Water Style, Dragon Water Whip! Leaf's Severe Hurricane! Earth Style. Petrifying Jutsu! The finishing blow! This isn't child's play. Let's get flashier! Petrifaction? That's being serious? Such amazing density and power! But I can't lose! Primary Lotus! How boring! It's true that you don't know any ninjutsu? Don't think you can beat me using only silly taijutsu. Are you saying my taijutsu doesn't work on that body? I don't know who your teacher is, but he really must be a useless jerk. Say what you will about me, but I will not allow you to badmouth Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei, for the honour of my Way of the Ninja, please allow me to use that technique. Third Gate of Life! Open! And Fourth Gate of Pain! Open! What is this? It isn't over yet! Fifth Gate of Closing! Open! This is fun! You suddenly became stronger, huh? However, I've got tricks like that, too! Overflowing! I'm overflowing with power! What's this? That fool! He drank the chakra directly! -Let's hurry! -Right! Here it comes! He transformed again? Eat this! Over there! The remaining two of the four who appeared at the Land of Ogres! -Neji! -Go! OK! You will not go past me! He's using Wind Chakra to manipulate them! From five directions! Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! Quite impressive. But how long will your chakra last? There! There! There! You really like to move around a lot, don't you? Well then, how's this? I'll destroy everything! ln order to get out of this dire situation, should l risk death to open the next Gate? Lee, in a super dire situation, eat this. Is it a new medicine? It's a chocolate bon bon. It's a "Chocolate Bomb"! It makes me so happy that you're thinking of me so much! I can't wait till I get into a super dire situation! No... Use this only when you are in a super-ultra-ultimate dire situation! Guy Sensei! What's going on here? It tastes just like the usual medicines. You ate something just now, didn't you? What was it? Hidden Lotus! Super Boom... Version! That incomplete bastard! I thought he was better than that. Looks like l used too much chakra. But why won't they use their combo attack? lt can't be? Looks like you figured it out, huh? You're not the only ones who use clones. Sakura! No one's coming after us. I must hand it to Neji. At this rate, we'll get through safely. Anaesthetic Jutsu! l must remove the toxin before it spreads. My body won't... Pretending you're down won't work, you know. Water Attack Gorgon! Rasengan! Not bad! Well then... Both were clones? Just kidding. Ninja Technique, Water Substitution. I'm able to turn parts of my body into fluid. You can't beat me with something like that. Well, you can't keep running away like that! I guess I'll tell you now. Myjob is to separate you from that Byakugan user. Damn it! Even if you go now, it's too late! Next time we meet, you'll pay! There probably won't be a next time. This world is over anyway! What? Dark Medical Jutsu, commence surgery. Bushy Brow, what did you drink? I didn't drink anything. It's Chocolate Bomb. Hey! I'm so glad you're all right. I was worried. Bushy Brow drank something and he's in a daze. Why the glum look? What's the matter? Hey, where's Shion? No way. It can't be. I did everything I could, but it was no use. Neji! What the hell were you doing? Weren't you gonna protect her? You're the one who said don't leave Shion's side! How could you let this happen when you were with her? Say something! Stop it. Shion... What's going on? Why? Why are there two Shions? The one who died was Taruho. Taruho... When he parted from us, Sir Taruho said he would prepare for such an emergency by taking a different route towards the shrine. But who could have imagined this was what he meant. Taruho? It's over, Sakura. Taruho! What is going on? Shadow Mirror Body Transfer Technique. It is a jutsu that has been passed down in the Land of Ogres. Once transformed, there is no way to revert back. Taruho insisted on becoming Shion's double and I couldn't stop him. Why didn't you force him to go back home? To complete this mission. And for that matter, a mission which decides the fate of the world, you do whatever you have to. Taruho, we'll give you a proper burial. Taruho was a fool. There is no need to grieve for some fool who chose to die. Do you realise who he died for? Quiet! Quiet! Be quiet! Wait! I said to wait! Taruho gave his life for you! He threw his life away for you! And you can't even shed a tear for him? Are you that cold-hearted? Don't you feel anything for him? When someone close to me dies, how can I not be heartbroken? You... I am not allowed to cry. Otherwise, it would desecrate the memory of the many who have died for me until today. Why? Foresight is a power to protect the life of a priestess. When a priestess perceives her own death, the soul of that priestess leaves the body, and shows her past self images of the moment of death... At the time of death, she sees the attendants around her. The priestess tells her attendants about her visions and these attendants believe that they must take her place in order to prevent her death. That is the set-up of precognitions. Sacrificing others, so that I may live. I don't really get it, but... So these precognitions are warnings of the priestess's death? I should just die and that would solve everything. How often I've thought that. But that is not allowed. If I die, there will be no one capable of sealing the Moryo and the world will be destroyed. No matter how painful or sad it is, someone must be sacrificed and I must continue living! That's crazy! Why must only those from the Land of Ogres sacrifice their lives? That's how it should be. That's how our people are. We will endure, no matter how unjust. As the priestess and people of this land, that is our destiny. And you're OK with that? Are you really OK with that? We lost Gitai. But the Priestess of the Land of Ogres has been eliminated without fail. Fool! The Moryo soul within me is aware. The priestess you killed was an impostor. The priestess with the sealing power still lives. Go. This time, make sure it's done. Yes! Taruho, we'll protect Shion without fail, so rest in peace. Naruto, we will wait here and stop the enemy. You will be responsible for taking Lady Shion to the Sealing Shrine. Me? Neji, Naruto's death has been foretold. Shouldn't one of us go? No! That is the reason why you must go, Naruto! All right, I understand! Don't turn back and go straight ahead! The Sealing Shrine is nearby. Run, Naruto! Right! Let's go, Shion! Byakugan! Lee said he saw during his battle with the enemy... When he swallowed something, his chakra suddenly magnified. lf they have a jutsu to replenish their chakra externally, it's possible for them to absorb chakra natures they never possessed in a short span of time. However, forcing chakra of a nature one is not used to into the body comes with a huge risk. The Ghost Army on the front line suddenly disappeared? Could they have somehow retreated? Maybe we're free from the threat of destruction! No, it's just the opposite. They are gambling on swift victory. Lee, Sakura, endure this for now. l'm sure they'll replenish their chakra. At that moment... No good. Any more and I'll run out of chakra. Brother! Chakra! I need to replenish my chakra! Hold on! I'll get it for you... Gentle Fist Art, Eight Trigrams, 64 Palms! Eight Trigrams! Two Palms! Four Palms! Eight Palms! Sixteen Palms! Thirty-two Palms! Sixty-four Palms! -Brother! -Brother! Why doesn't the chakra enhancement work? I used my Gentle Fist to puncture all your chakra points, severing your chakra flow! Brother! Shizuku! What? Naruto... We're here, Lady Priestess. That's the entrance over there. Have you been here before? No! I just had this feeling. All right! Go seal this Moryo quickly and defy that so-called destiny of yours! They call it destiny because you can't... Don't kid yourself! I'll change it easily! What's that? Terracotta Army... That's the terrycloth army? Terracotta! That they're on the march means he's already nearby. -What'll we do? -We'll charge straight in! Keep your legs like this! And hold on tight! Eat this! Saved... Will l be saved again? What if l could die like this? Naruto, and also my people wouldn't have to sacrifice their lives for the time being... I really hit my back out there. You shouldn't have saved me. Then you wouldn't have to die. At least, until the world is destroyed by the Moryo. Maybe. But, I won't die! Absolutely no way! -It's useless! -It's not useless! Then I'll be the one to die! I won't let you die either! One of us has to die! Don't decide that! We can change it any way we want! Don't make me say it so often. There's no... I'll protect you! But there's no way you can. Trust me. Why am l turning my back to him? Trust... I have a strategy. And it'll work this time! Naruto... All right! Let's go! Naruto. Promise me. Sure. I promise on my Way of the Ninja! Sorry to keep you waiting! Rasengan! One more time! Here we go! Can't you use that to blow them all away? Quit talking like it's so easy! Do you know how exhausted this makes me? Naruto... Go! Hurry and go! What're you doing? Go! It's so confusing! Make the real you easy to distinguish! This is no time for that! Think about the situation, fool! Don't you lose! Don't let a single one get through! lt wasn't him. lt wasn't him. Not yet... Not yet... This is where Naruto will die. How you've grown. You resemble Miroku. Let us offer our greetings to the young priestess. My name is Yomi. Long ago, your mother Miroku stood in the way of my ambitions. Do you remember that day? We had resurrected Moryo as our leader and the Thousand-Year Kingdom was within our grasp. Your mother... If only that priestess had not been there! Stay away. Stay away! Why are you so shocked? Could you possibly be unaware of your power? What a surprise. Just what have you been taught all this time? Just for this day, each and every day, I... Honed your Sealing Jutsu? Then hurry over here and seal me. Can you? l will protect you. You meant that, right, Naruto? Damn it! There's no end to this! I shall tell you. I cannot kill you. And you do not have the power to kill me. Because originally, we were one and the same entity. That is a lie! You are trying to trick me with lies! Is there any reason for me to lie? I shall, right at this moment... The seal... Refers to you and I becoming one. Your mother, Miroku, accepted that. Yes, Miroku, your mother, is within me! Because of the enormous power to ensure that we did not err in using it, we have separated ourselves into two hearts, two minds and we have lived demonstrating each other, thinking of each other, staring each other down. Although before long, our names were changed to the priestess and Moryo. Light, Dark, Good, Evil... Such words cannot bind us! Hatsu! Jin! Kai! A barrier? Min, Shin, Gan, Reppyou, Shouzen, Mika, Dan, Raku, Shou! Fuu, Sai, Dan, Gika, Ragu, Bagi! Push! I won't let you pass! No way! The priestess is doing her best inside there. I won't let you interfere! You were too hasty, Priestess. You should've waited until this one decayed to put up the barrier. lt was in order to get in here... Once a barrier is up, we cannot get out. Yes, until one consumes the other. And that is decided by each other's chakra. How's that for my attack? I won't lose! Even if I run out of chakra. Lightning Blade! Now you shall return it. My flesh and body. You have my thanks. That one no longer had the power to break the seal on the shrine. What have I done? What was the purpose of all these years... Shion! Have you done it? Is it completely sealed? Naruto... What's the matter? Oh, I see, you must be tired. I didn't deserve to be protected by you and all the others. Shion! There's no need for tears. As long as that light is there, I cannot absorb you into me. But are you sure? You may not like what you see... The end of this world. Shion! l am alive. Then, Naruto is... Damn it! lf things go on as is, Naruto will... Naruto will... Why do you not understand? If you combined yourjutsu with the Moryo's power, ruling the world would be simple! Such folly... Why do you not have faith in people? Have faith in people? Are you serious, Miroku? Mother... Mother, your lap is so warm. You're such a baby, Shion. I want to stay like this forever. Why would you give such a thing? I will not teach this child anyjutsu. That is my order! But... Here. Hold on to this all the time. So pretty! ls it a good luck charm? Yes. This will protect you from now on. No matter what should happen to me, keep your heart true. Even if Mother should fade from your presence, know that all things in this world are ephemeral. Mother! Do you insist on getting in my way, Miroku? Enough! I will not borrow your power. But you realise what that will mean? Shion! Your bell? What? Do not underestimate the power of a priestess! I see. You will risk your life and pass... Through time! I have a strategy! And it'll work this time! You can't change destiny. You keep saying the same thing. Naruto. You must live. Too slow! Naruto. You must live! What? What'd you do? I've seen that power once before. Are you sure? Giving up your priestess amulet to a man... Fine. If that is your wish, I shall grant it. And watch as my body becomes one with yours, and those who tried to protect you perish! Yes! As the world of humans rots away. This would've been fine. If I had known this from the start, all those people of my homeland wouldn't have had to die. Isn't that so, Mother? Shion, how l wish you could have spent your days in peace and calm. Such a duty is... Shion's power... Even one mistake, and it could become a menace even greater than the Moryo. And that child would be unable to control it... In that case, we must seal that power in this stone and suppress what will awaken if she should die even at the cost of our people's lives. Mother... Shion... l, your mother, was unable to protect you nor have faith in you. Do you blame me? No, Mother. I love you so much. This is... l understand how l must use this power now. Release! So many priestesses until today... l can even hear voice of those who died young. l see. lt has been a long time. So that's it. That bell holds this power of yours. It is over. Naruto, can you hear me? From this day on, all of you must protect this world... This is my destiny. It's not impossible. I'll protect you. I promise on my Way of Ninja. You are a liar. You will disappear with me. You stupid priestess! Open your eyes! Breathe! Can you see? Can you hear? What is your heart telling you? That it wants to die like this? You want to fade and disappear? But... I can't hear you! Shion! Say it in your own words! I don't want to! All right! Lightning Blade! I and all my comrades... Shadow Possession Jutsu! ..don't want to lose anyone! Summoning Blade Dance! No need to accept a destiny that you don't like! More! Release all your feelings! Too slow! Eat this! Shion's and my Super Chakra Rasengan! I promised, right? That I'd change your destiny! Mother... What's that? Well, thank goodness it ended with just this. We ended up creating a new volcano. Cripes. It's because we let him handle it. Put me down. Well, this means your priestess days are over. No, I must still continue as a priestess. I realised it when I was inside him. It is the evil in people's hearts which gave rise to the Moryo in this world. Who can say that a second or third Moryo won't appear? And I must be especially careful of a genin. I won't curse my fate again. Being a priestess is my mission. Isn't that so, Naruto? And this power must be passed on to the next priestess. How about it, Naruto? Won't you help me in doing so? Sure! I'll help you all you like! THE END
