BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER I'm sorry! And? This is the nicest French toast I've had in my entire life. You have to give me the recipe. Oh, goodness. I... -She lost it. -Burned it. Forgot it. Tore it up. She ate it. I didn't eat it. I crushed it and mixed it in with the eggs. And then ate it. -She fed it to the chickens. -I did not. -I grated it in with the cheese. -She did-- She folded it into a paper airplane and flew it off a cliff. Not too bad! She's a keeper, Dad. Okay, all little jokes aside. The recipe. Well, the truth is... the recipe is a family secret. So only once you marry my dad will I be able to tell you. -I have to get going. -Same here. Thank you so much for this lovely feast. And when you have a moment, send me some pics of your dad in the cellar too. For the magazine! Theo can be in it too. He also helped. You know what to do. Ellen, wait. I'll walk with you. How's it going with the matchmaking? Slow. My dad's a closed book. It was nice of him to share the spotlight with me last night. You deserved it. Nobody's captured the painted lady on camera yet. Yes, the evasive little rascal. I'm sure you're aware that the painted lady butterfly species has a very short life span. Only two to three weeks. You obviously want it to be perfect. Good light, the right angle. Nice composition. But to achieve that perfect harmony is rather difficult. It's nearly impossible. Sometimes we have to content ourselves with what we have... before time runs out. I'll still find her. I'm convinced you will. There will be a photo session in the cellar later. Ellen said you should come along. Should I do something with my hair or... No, no. Leave that to the makeup artist. Just kidding. You look like you had an awful breakfast this morning, Dad. Smile a bit. This morning was excessive. Oh, please. Open the bottle. -Slowly. I need to capture the movement. -Yes. I'm cutting off the foil capsule. Ellen is a classy woman who's clearly crazy about you. Someone to keep in mind for future company and conversation. Would you mind letting me in on your hidden agenda at some point? We both know that room upstairs is holding you back. Holding me back? Do you want to hear what Ina told me last night? "Don't let those winning wines fly off the shelves before you do." -Insensitive woman. -She's not the only one, Dad. It's the whole town, and they're right. But I can't just go and marry Theo if there's nobody to look after you. Flowery bouquet. Deep undertones of oak with a trace of chocolate. As a winemaker's daughter, you ought to know... that the best things in life are not always controllable. -I'm sorting that room out today. -Don't overreact, munchkin. We've waited too long, Dad. It's happening today, right now. Come, Dad. Hello? Then I'll do it alone. I'm on time, right? Am I not early? The view is breathtaking. That diary. Your mother categorically stated that she never wanted to discuss its contents. Neither with me, nor with you. I've waited for this day to come for over 30 years. And yet, here I stand and... I honestly don't know what to tell you, munchkin. Honestly? You want to be honest, Dad. An honest person tells the truth. This... what it says in here. If this is true then you haven't been honest with me for a day of my life. Do you think it's easy for me? To know I have another child somewhere in the world. I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, or if my child is doing fine. If the person... who you love the most in this world asks you... pleads with you, to keep a secret... then you do so. I truly hope you made the right decision all those years ago. "I'm a farm girl. I have rules and an endless to-do list. I have to care for my dad. I don't like change at all. I cannot speak French. The French smoke. And I hate croissants. They're too buttery. Traveling makes me anxious. Mom had nothing good to say about the place. And I have a feeling Theo wants to ask me to marry him. The chance that I might find him or her is basically zero." Twelve reasons why I shouldn't go to Paris. You look tired, munchkin. I'm not sleeping. Not at all. There's a slight chance that this he or she will still have the key. I stocked up the fridge and you must go and buy fresh veggies next week. I've sent the last photos for the magazine to Ellen. Don't answer the phone when she's here. Women like to know they're top of your list. Come on. -And please remember your-- -Yes, the vitamins. I've got it. He's always on time. Does he know he's taking you to the airport? Munchkin? I'll explain on the way. -Morning, Theo. -Morning. I'll be back in four weeks. Look after yourself. Excuse me. And now? I need to ask you a favor. Paris? You're going on your own to find this person in one month? And all you have is your mom's cryptic diary and a necklace. I'm fully aware that I'm crazy. No, no. You're not crazy. It's just not like you at all. And if you don't find who you're looking for, what then? Then I hope for a bit of truth. Well, I hope you find it. And that it sets you free to come home again. To where you belong. Seek and ye shall find! ...a pastry chef... What would you like? Need a bit more time? I... no French. Here's your coffee. No! Drugs are not allowed in here. Come on, get out of here! This is unacceptable! Where's my photographer? This is ridiculous! -I've been expecting you for half an hour! -She's a dealer. Great! A drug addict who has no regard for time! Where are you going? What the heck do you want from me? Not bad. Miss, did you take these pictures? In your dreams. Oh, please. Forever. Here you are. You're dreaming. Good news. Hi. The door was open. I brought you a copy of the magazine. And supper. I didn't know what you like. So I brought along a couple of things. Spaghetti Bolognese or... chicken korma? I never lock the door. I'll warm up the spaghetti then. Ellen. I can't really cook. But I thought you're alone and... I actually just wanted to eat a slice of bread, really. I haven't had a thick slice of bread with homemade butter on it for ages. I'll make one for you as well. You can get some rooibos tea ready. Devonair had been in Mia-Marie's family for more than 100 years already, and I was lucky to marry her. Especially after we got pregnant. They're the lucky ones. She looked after the olive trees and I tended to the vines and... After her death, Lise insisted on taking over her mother's responsibilities herself. Stubborn. Just like her mother. I want to do something exciting. Now? You'll have to take a day off next week. Theo is more than capable of looking after the farm for one day. And in any case, isn't it time you started considering retirement, old man? Retirement? Well, Theo is the best winemaker I know. Just a pity Lise doesn't drink wine. Sounds like a load of nonsense. Does he always talk to himself? Sorry. It's... rabbit. Rabbit. My pleasure. Good night. Good night, miss. Good morning. Morning. I wanted to tell you I'm taking the day off. Okay. No problem. There isn't a problem, is there? Of course not. -Anything else? -No. I just never see you outside without a hat. That's all. Oh, one thing. I'm busy planning something special. For when Lise returns. Munchkin! Hello, Daddy! Can you talk? Yes, go ahead. How are things on your side? Well, it's far more pleasant than I anticipated. Found anything yet? No, but I have found somebody who is helping me search. You mustn't go and fall in love with the place. Dad? Hello? Are you all right? -Dad? -Sorry, munchkin. I must go. I'm going hiking. Hiking? Hello? Dad? Hiking? Mom? Bijoux Au Troquet, the jeweler. You know it? Is it for a girl? Well, Rue de Miromesnil, in that area? Hey! I want to meet her before you buy her a ring. Sir. Sir, madam. It's ready. Hi! You're so cute. CALL IF YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THIS LOCKET Is this your wife? No, sir. Your girlfriend? Sir, can you help us out? She should be your girlfriend. Okay. Why isn't she your girlfriend? I'm helping her find a lost loved one. Is that so? Someone who broke your heart? The locket. Ah, yes. My goodness. It's genuine. Wait. My father only made five. A limited series. In solid gold. Here are the names of the people who bought them 30 years ago. Here you are. Thank you very much, sir. Don't wait until there's only strawberry jam left. Hello, Mr. Dupont? Thank you. Sorry to bother you. I just want to know if you recognize this locket. Sorry, I don't. I am Frenchman. Good morning. I am Frenchman. Who are you? Good! You speak well. Very impressed. I am Frenchman. I like making food. I like... you! Me too. I like that. Two glasses? Just a tiny bit, please. You do realize you'll be kissing a full-blooded tough cookie. Wait. Now I'm ready. Lavender. Retire? What the... Your father's planning to retire. What do you mean? It's a very pretty label. A very pretty girl. Well, speak of the devil. Munchkin, how are you? Dad, what's all this about retirement? I've been trying to get hold of you. No, I've been trying to get hold of you. How's your search coming along? Don't try to change the subject. We're all very excited for you to come back now. Is Theo there? Is he there, Dad? Is he there to ask? -Munchkin. -I'm not ready yet. Say "no." Please excuse me. Olive? The situation with Theo is uncomfortable for me. I've been trying for a very long time to dodge this moment. Just give me a few days. Please, Dad. You're the one who insisted on rummaging through your mother's things, Lise. And you started this whole thing. Theo's a good man. There are only two names left to check. Tell me again, how is Paris? Paris is lovely, Dad. Then come back. Now. Before it turns into a dark, hollow place like it did for your mother. How's she doing? Well... I think we need something stronger. I'll fetch some whiskey. I can't believe it. Sugar? Since when? -This is not the time to judge me. -I'm not judging you. I'm intrigued. And your hair is different. But it suits you. It's very nice. So will you introduce her to me soon? -Who? -The one who put that look in your eye. I don't know. One minute, I feel I know her well. And the next, she's like a stranger to me. And how's your cookbook coming? I've never seen you like this before. Don't let her get away. Okay? She must have been heartbroken being so lonely. I promise you. Just who do you think I am? Of course. Oh, no. Hello? Yes, sir. I realize that. I apologize. It will be delivered tomorrow. No problem. I can't believe it. No Recipe by Jean-Pierre Baptiste Excuse me? You grated it with the cheese? Oh, my God. I can't believe it. How come I didn't see it before? What an idiot! Understand? You have to swear it to me, Lise. This is Izak le Roux. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message. Alexandre Dubois owner of Café Alexandre -Hi, Aimée. -We're not open yet. -Jean-Pierre-- -He's not in. Aimée, help me please. I-- He's very sick. And a bit crazy. -Cuckoo. -Oh, yes. He could die at any moment. Then please tell me, Aimée. Thank you. -Marion? -Yes, sir. I'll get the door. I'm looking for Mr. Dubois. Follow me. Who is it? Marion. -Something wrong, sir? -No. There's a red envelope in my office for this young lady. Please. Oh, Mommy. No Recipe by Jean-Pierre Baptiste Oh, my God. -Hello? -Hello. Mrs. Baptiste? Yes? My name is Lise. Hi, Lise. Alexandre phoned to tell me about this call. Have you thought it through? But I've seen you before. Ah, yes. I should've known. Come in. Are you all right? Yes, it's the one from the gallery. Babette's the artist. Would you like some tea? Yes, thank you. Yes, is he here? I don't understand anymore. Nobody knew about it. That's how Mom wanted it. Wait, you're the one who put that look in his eyes. Wait. -This is Jean-Pierre. Leave a message. -He doesn't answer. Oh, gosh. This is the craziest day in my life. Well! What a pain! Go away! It isn't you. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's the truth. Wait a minute. And you never, ever thought about informing me? -It wasn't my secret to reveal. -Mine neither. And what about me? If you couldn't have children. Yes, that's the case sometimes. The more relaxed the woman is, the more-- Okay, I get it. That's enough. What about that key? How come I never saw it before? Dad only gave it to me on my 21st birthday. After that, I kept it secret. "To live without loving is not really to live." Molière. They're here. Come. So. Do I look okay? Perfect. Thank you. Come. Mr. Le Roux. Welcome back. Papa. Babette. My papa. Welcome. Let me get your suitcase. There we go. The two of you together. -Pretty! -Kisses for her. -Come, Dad. -No, no, no. Come on, Dad. This is really tasty for your first stint in the kitchen. Well, I had loads of help. That's my dad. Must be Theo. I'll get it. Very nice. Hey. Hi. Sorry. I'm really glad you came. I suppose it can't be very com-- No. It's okay. Well, not really. But I'm still glad you're here. Come inside. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. And my sister, Babette. Theo, grab a chair. Come. What's that? The package you... I don't know. It came in the mail. It's from Paris. It's beautiful. Look at this, Dad. I took the photos. Wow. -There's the Frenchman too. -"Le handsome." It's my brother. Cheers. -Well done on the book. -Thank you. Come see how beautiful it is. -It smells so fresh. -Yes. They're here. Come. Alex, hey? Come give Grandpa a hug. That's so good, good, good. Alex, close your eyes. Grandpa brought you a little surprise. -Wait, don't open yet. Don't open yet. -One, two, three. Let's go inside. Come, come.
