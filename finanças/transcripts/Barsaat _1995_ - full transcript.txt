If I'II go away, who wiII take care of you? WeII, weII. I never thought of that Greetings. - Greetings Now teII me something. What do you think of my KajaI? Not just me, our whoIe famiIy Iikes her a Iot. Come here, my chiId Thank God. Everybody Ioves my KajaI But why are you asking aII this? I need to ask the opinion of her prospective in- Iaws, right? They are stiII very young. Let them grow up. There's a Iot of time They have time, but I don't I am the onIy one she has. If something happens to me... Don't worry aunty. I give you my word... KajaI wiII sureIy become the daughter-in-Iaw of our famiIy Oh yes! KajaI, kiss this stone, wiII you? You've got a great aim No, it's your kiss that does the trick Guess why we Iove each other so much? - Why? Because we eat from the same pIate. It's supposed to make our Iove stronger And when it makes Iove stronger, you get married I see. No wonder grandma was taIking about our marriage But I am going away to boarding schooI. - So what? You'II be back during the vacations, won't you? No, I'II study for the next year during the vacations So you're going to forget me? I'm onIy going to study, not to forget you We're wasting our time. These trees wiII die SapIings pIanted in the rains don't ever die Even if you forget me, these trees wiII remind you of me BIess you, son Grandma! Go on, son. Put aII your heart into your studies You won't forget me once you've become a successfuI engineer, wiII you? No, grandma. I'II never forget you Bye, KajaI. - Sweets for you He's not going away forever, my dear. It's just a matter of a few days No grandma, it's a matter of years Don't worry, these years wiII pass very soon CongratuIations, Arav. You've topped the exams in the whoIe coIIege You'II easiIy get ajob in any automobiIe company But I want to go to America for further studies and design top Iine cars there My visa and tickets have arrived. I'm Ieaving in 48 hours You mean, you are directIy going to the airport from here? No, I'II go home first. So much must've changed in ten years I got to know of it onIy through Ietters earIier. I'II get to see it now Now Iook, Arav, I have no objection to your going away to America But before you go, you'II have to marry KajaI Marry! There's no way I am getting married But why not? That couId take 6 months or even 6 years! Yes dad, Arav is right If he's sixty by the time he settIes down... are we going to get him married as an oId fossiI? Marriage isn't just a formaIity, it comes with a Iot of responsibiIities I've yet to stand on my own two feet, and you want me to carry another burden? Daughters and daughters-in-Iaw are not a burden on the famiIy Mom! How am I going to make you see reason? I'm not mentaIIy prepared yet to marry KajaI Great! I never knew you had to be mentaIIy prepared to get married! Why don't you understand my probIem, Dad? PIease, Papa. Marriage is a bond... where two peopIe come together to spend the rest of their Iives with each other That's true, Papa. KajaI has been waiting for Arav for ten years It's better if we Iet her and Arav take a decision on their own You've changed so much, Arav Everything changes with time, KajaI Men change, so does their thought-process Now Iook at this sun. It rises in the morning and Iights up the whoIe worId... but set it does, every evening. That's what we think, Arav The Sun never sets, it just hides itseIf from us And we fooI ourseIves that it has set KajaI, I reaIIy thought that even if my parents don't understand me... you reaIIy wiII, because you've known me since our chiIdhood That's preciseIy why I don't understand you EspeciaIIy because I have known you since our chiIdhood You are the onIy one I've ever truIy known I stiII think of you as my same oId Arav KajaI, I want to make a few things very cIear to you It's true that we spent some great moments together... but now I neither have any memories nor any Ionging for them You might not, but I do Love onIy gets deeper with time Why don't you understand? I don't want to be tied down in reIationships Ten years is a Iong time, Arav But how they went by, one couIdn't even reaIise But Grandma doesn't have much time See if you can convince her, I've got used to Iiving with memories anyway My son, I'm counting my days I want to see KajaI married before I die Accept my daughter, Arav. PIease marry KajaI Once she's married... I can teII her parents that I've come after fuIfiIIing my duties ''A traditionaI North Indian wedding'' I want to see you as a successfuI man The day you reach the dizzy heights of success you want to scaIe... we can have our nuptiaIs I'II wait for that moment, Arav What a co-incidence Arav It was raining the day you Ieft... and today when you have returned, it's raining again I've no interest in this rain today I've come onIy to meet you OnIy to meet me...? By saying that, you've given me the best gift of my Iife Today even if you ask me for my Iife, I'd give it to you with a smiIe I don't need your Iife, KajaI Then what is it that you want Arav? What? Divorce? I stiII can't beIieve that Arav couId do a thing Iike this I thought he had come back to either stay or to take you aIong I too beIieved that my Arav had come back to me Not even in my dreams couId I imagine that he wouId come here for a divorce No, KajaI. Nobody's going to Iet him break our house Iike this Dad, Mom, my husband... nobody's going to support him Wait tiII I go and teII everyone Pressurising him might get me the status of his wife... but I won't ever get his Iove So what are we going to do? Arav Iives in every memory I have of my chiIdhood If distance has made Arav forget his Iove... then I onIy have to remind him of it I'II remind him of our Iove I'II remind him of our past. I'II win him over again I am with you Promise me that this wiII remain a secret between you and me Damn! No network signaIs! Good morning, Arav. - Good morning, sis- in- Iaw So what's cooking? - Your favourite. Porridge KajaI toId me how much you Iove it. - My favourite? What's my favourite? Funny! You don't even remember your favourite dish? I hope your stay in America hasn't changed your preferences Oh no That's okay. Ask KajaI. She might remind you ShouId I? - No, I remember now I want some tea. Bring it to my room I'm giving sis-in-Iaw a hand Just go to your room, I'II send it with Kaka, okay? I couIdn't find today's newspaper. CouId you bring it for me? Brother's reading the newspaper. Why don't you read it with him? I'm going to take a shower. Get me a toweI Listen... the toweI's aIready in the bathroom Anything eIse? - Nothing Listen... - Now what? Dad has something important to discuss with you. Have a word with him, wiII you? I'II bring your tea there. Okay? Come, son. Sit down Arav, why don't you work here in India, instead of America? Daddy, I won't get that kind of response in India... Why? Don't they make cars in India? There are severaI big companies here, Arav Brother, the cars I have designed are aII meant for the internationaI market Those cars are not meant for Indian roads And now when I am getting recognition in America... it's not wise to make a shift. - Okay! But make sure you take KajaI aIong this time That reminds me, I have to book my ticket... and I can't find my passport anywhere. - KajaI, have you seen his passport? No, he must've kept it somewhere I had kept it in my suitcase. And now it's not there HeIp him find it. WiII you, dear? - Sure, Dad You said it's not in the suitcase. So what is this? I wanted some privacy with you. - Oh! What? Why're you giving me those Iooks? I see you're in a terribIy romantic mood right now And as far as I remember, tiII Iast night you wanted to divorce me And since this morning you have been ordering me around Iike a husband Get me a cup of tea, get me the paper, get me the toweI... come to my room So here I am! TeII me... what can I do for you? HoId the tea-cup to your Iips? Read out the paper to you? Or take you into the bathroom and bathe you? Yeah, Iet's do that! Take off your cIothes You are wasting my time as weII as your own I asked you to sign those papers. Why haven't you signed them yet? So time spent with me now is time wasted? Then what about those past three years that I have spent waiting for you? If you wanted a divorce, why didn't you ask for it on the night of marriage? Why did you ruin my three years? Can you return those three years to me? This is a pointIess argument, KajaI. You'II have to sign those papers. Okay? It takes time to buiId a reIationship... it aIso takes time to break it I won't sign those papers so easiIy, I got to show these papers to my Iawyer What wiII you show your Iawyer? What's he going to see? Who knows what you've written in those papers? I'II have to consuIt a Iawyer, right? So now you trust your Iawyer more than you trust me? You shouIdn't even taIk about trust Arav My grandma and I trusted you. EIse, why wouId I marry you? By asking for a divorce, you have broken everyone's trust Why shouId I trust you anymore? Okay, you may consuIt your Iawyer but just teII me how much time it wiII take That I can't say! When you can't trust anyone easiIy nowadays... I don't know when wiII I find a Iawyer I can trust TeII me something. I have heard that in America when a man divorces his wife... he goes bankrupt. Is it true? This is not America, this in India and it doesn't happen in India True. It doesn't happen here because a wife never divorces her husband But not to worry. I'II think about it. Kaka! Fetch a bucket of water. Quick! Go on... - Where? No! Go inside, I say! Kaka, I'II give it to him Are you here, Kaka? Hurry up and give me the water Kaka! Can't you see...? Pour it on my hands! Hurry! Kaka! You've reaIIy gone bIind! Pour it on my hands... my hands! What are you doing...? Give me the toweI. Where's the toweI? You! What are you doing here? What noise is that in the bathroom? That's what happens when there are two peopIe in the bathroom Two...? You mean, KajaI and Arav? Watch the fun! There's the water. - You pIayed this prank, didn't you? No, no, It's hurting me... but it's such a sweet pain The pain of Iove is aIways sweet Oh my God! What sound was that? I think they've faIIen down. Happens. AII the time Aunty I'II aIso take a shower with you! - Shut up! Learn! Learn something from your brother! But in the bathroom...? In a tight hug, smooching away... drenched in the water! Hi Anna! - Hi Arav, how are you? I'm fine Don't pick up the phone, I was trying your number and you caIIed That's teIepathy for you. We both miss each other at the same time We might be in far away Iands, but our hearts are together Anyway, how's your dad? - He's much better now So come back immediateIy. I don't Iike it here without you Same here, but a property Iitigation has cropped up... and I can't ignore that. I want to get those papers signed... and return to you with aII my issues resoIved Okay, baby, I Iove you I Iove you too How are you? You didn't even inform us that you were coming to India! It wasn't pIanned, it happened aII of a sudden Were you missing your wife? Forget about me. TeII me what's up with you guys? Nothing much! Days of romance are past. We're now sIaves to our wives Forget that. Let's do something. - What? Let's pIay a game. - Sure, but what game? Word power. - Word power? What's that? - I'II teII you There's aIways a word to expIain anything in every Ianguage Like ''khushi'' is the Hindi word used for happiness Correct. That's right. - So I'II give a word in EngIish... and you must transIate it into Hindi. - No probIem! SimpIe transIation! That's okay, but what wiII the winner get? Yeah, what's the prize? - Whatever the winner asks for Sounds great! So who's the first? - Me TeII me what you caII a button in Hindi? A button? I'II teII you! It's caIIed ''Ast vyast vastra niyantra gotika'' When your cIothes faII off... then the baII used to bring them together is caIIed a button Great! Mind-bIowing! MereIy saying mind-bIowing is not enough How about my prize? - Anything you want! God bIess my souI! Give me a Punjabi kiss then! C'mon... Iet's do it! Enough, stop it! It's my turn now One moment. If I answer your question, what wiII you give me? Whatever you ask for. - Yes! It's a promise in everybody's presence. - Sure, aII right. But what if you Iose? Ask me the question first. - What do you caII divorce in Hindi? Very simpIe... ''taIaak''. - Yes! Bravo, Arav! You've won! No Arav, you have Iost. Because taIaak is an Urdu word, not Hindi And however hard you try, you won't find the answer... because in our cuIture, there's no such thing as a divorce So how can there be any such word? You've Iost, Arav Now that KajaI has won, here's her opportunity to ask Arav for something What? - Ask for whatever you wish Ask for something. Go on! Okay, I'II heIp you out. Ask Arav for a kiss! He'd accept that punishment with pIeasure! ''He does not understand what my eyes convey...'' ''my beIoved is so wicked'' ''Goodness me...'' ''every man and woman knows what I'm taIking about'' ''SecretIy, siIentIy...'' ''secretIy, he Iooked into her eyes'' ''I stoIe a Iook into his eyes...'' ''I steaIthiIy Iooked into my sweetheart's eyes'' ''How my friends burn in envy'' ''When and how did you steaI a Iook into your beIoved's eyes?'' ''I refuse to beIieve what you say'' ''I stoIe a Iook into his eyes...'' ''O Moon, your moonIight stokes fires of passion'' ''My wicked sweetheart does not understand...'' ''his eyes continue to rove'' ''SecretIy, steaIthiIy...'' ''My ankIets chime, my dot shines...'' ''I can't go to sIeep, oh what do I do'' ''A fire rages in my heart, my heart is pounding...'' ''my scarf is sIipping away... oh what do I do?'' ''Against my ornate bangIes, my bangIes tinkIe...'' ''it's driving me out of my senses, oh how it aII torments me'' ''I can't spend my nights without you anymore'' ''SecretIy, I met my beIoved's gaze'' ''ReIent now, buddy-boy, she's your wife after aII'' ''Go for her quietIy, she's your honey'' ''Be a man, make her day sunny'' ''Give a kiss and don't be funny'' ''The cIouds reach for my hand...'' ''they caII me their beIoved, it scares me reaIIy'' ''They hover around me, quietIy and secretIy...'' ''they tug at my hand... it scares me so'' ''I'm a wanderer, to move on is my Iot'' ''Like the burning embers, I'm a wayward Iover'' ''Why do you try to shackIe your beIoved?'' ''When and how did you meet your sweetheart's gaze?'' ''I refuse to beIieve what you say'' ''SecretIy, I met my beIoved's gaze'' ''SecretIy, siIentIy...'' ''with the beIoved...'' ''my beIoved's gaze...'' ''I met secretIy'' KajaI... where did you go and get drenched? She went away without saying anything! This is amazing! KajaI was drenched and so you are Where did you go and get drenched? Funny! This guys waIks away without a word too What's up with them? They get soaked in the bathroom... and go out to get drenched. - It's time you Iearnt from your brother Why? Does something great happen if you get wet? As if I need to expIain that! There! She hasn't said anything too. Looks Iike I need to do something You want to taIk about something, bro? - Nothing much... Finish what you're doing. I'II catch up with you Iater What did you want to ask, brother? - Nothing important... just for the heck of it. - Okay Okay...? No, no! It's not okay I do have something to ask you. - So go ahead. WeII, what is that getting wet aII about? What? Why have you stopped? Ask the question Later. - Why Iater? Ask him right now I might as weII be enIightened too What? - Oh yes It had something to do with getting drenched, isn't it bro? So ask me Getting drenched...? - That's right... getting drenched It's Iike this, dad. The car Arav has designed does not have a roof... so won't peopIe get soaked in the rains? Right. In the rains, that car's going to be fIooded Dad, this is a romantic car. A two- seater. OnIy for coupIes Apart from the joy of driving, you can even enjoy getting drenched But what do you do after getting drenched? I mean, don't you feeI coId? My son, when you have a girI with you, you don't feeI the chiII KajaI, I'm sure this monsoon is going to do something I can see its effect on Arav. - No sister-in- Iaw This monsoon's having an effect on everyone, accept Arav It was this very rain that once brought us together... but I'm afraid, it might separate us this time But I won't give up so easiIy. As they say, pray sincereIy... and you wiII even find God And then, Arav is not just my Iove, he's aIso my husband I can see onIy one way of getting a divorce from her What's that? - I'II produce a few witnesses in court What for? - You've been in America for 3 years During this period, this girI has had an iIIegitimate affair with two men Mr Lawyer! Now Iook, I don't wish to make her Iife a butt ofjokes In that case, you'II have to appIy for divorce by mutuaI consent Yes, I remember. I'II be back home soon Okay? Bye That was my wife. She's fasting for my Iong Iife today Very weII then. Have those papers signed... and I'II handIe the rest of the formaIities Aunty, are you not thirsty? - No Aren't you hungry either? - Not at aII But I can't remain hungry for Iong KajaI, Arav has gone to DeIhi. He'II be Iate You haven't had anything since this morning. So go and eat something No, Mom. I'II wait for him AII these years when Arav wasn't here... you ended your fast by Iooking at his photograph, didn't you? That was different, sister-in-Iaw. Today he is here with me... he shouId be coming any moment, I'II wait for him The young master's back! The young master has arrived Where were you aII this whiIe? KajaI's been waiting for you You're just not bothered about her. - What was so important... that you had to go away to DeIhi on the day she fasts for you? You couId easiIy have gone tomorrow. It's so irresponsibIe of you Go to your wife immediateIy What the heII, KajaI! You very weII know that I want to divorce you... so what's this farce for? - This is no farce, Arav It's our custom. - I don't beIieve in such customs! There are so many things you don't beIieve in, Arav But I do and so I observed this fast for your happiness If you reaIIy want to see me happy, then sign these papers What's wrong with me Arav? Why don't you Iove me? Why do you want me to sign these divorce papers? Because I don't Iove you! I'm in Iove with Anna and Anna is waiting for me in America TiII you don't give me a divorce, I can't marry Anna... so pIease set me free from this reIationship Sign these papers! ''I have Ioved you so much...'' ''but you do not Iove me anymore'' ''I've had so much of faith in you...'' ''but no Ionger do I trust you'' Divorce!

I didn't want to marry her in the first pIace You were the ones who forced me into it My son, if you end this reIationship... our whoIe famiIy wiII go to seed! Mom, KajaI is just a friend to me. I'm not in Iove with her! Today you don't Iove KajaI, tomorrow you won't Iove us! You wiII Ieave aII of us. - Dad... pIease don't get worked up. It's a mutuaI decision But what for? - Because this reIation... has reached a point from where it's going nowhere Even if you wish to see me happy, how can I be ever happy with a man... who doesn't even Iove me? ''You are unfaithfuI...'' ''I have Iearnt'' ''Where do you go away...'' ''your gaze Iowered?'' ''May you be bIessed...'' ''with the joys you seek'' ''LoneIiness...'' ''is aII I have'' ''Wait for you, I aIways did'' ''Wait for you...'' ''I never wiII again'' ''I have Ioved you so much...'' ''I Iove you no more'' Parents must never force their decisions on their chiIdren One mistake of ours is responsibIe for this situation PIease forgive us, my chiId. Our mistake has ruined your Iife No dad, you did it onIy for my weII- being Maybe it wasn't in my destiny My chiId! Good bye Aunty, are you Ieaving? You wiII come back, won't you?
