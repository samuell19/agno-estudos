Hello, Mr. Wong! Hello, Jayden! Welcome aboard! I had no idea. I had no idea that you would go this far either. Be careful. Let me help you. Thank you! When you need help next time, be sure to ask one of the crew, okay? This is the signing ceremony of the Skylette buyout. According to the agreement, the Cheung Group will make the full payment for the Skylette shares in a lump sum. Let's have the CEO of Cheung Group, Mr. Branson Cheung, to sign for the company. Thank you! Give me a hand! Which one? The thumb! Thumb! I can't find it! What do you mean you can't find it? - Can you find your brain? - Here it is! Hurry! Come on! I'm sorry, Sam! I was stuck in traffic. You're not late, I'm just early. Right! After all, the 300 lives on the plane are in your hands. It's better to be here early to get ready. Have some water. We're almost there. Excuse me. I'm Pee. I have a ticket, but there are four of us in total. I am just an employee. If I don't get on this plane, I can't do my job. Why are we still on the ground? I'm sorry, but we're doing our final preparations. What's wrong? Captain Tong, a checked-in passenger in first class did not board the plane. - Is that TM? - Yes. Do you know her? - I bet only you don't! - I bet only you don't! Pardon me. Even if you don't get here in ten steps, I still have to wait, so hurry up! No, don't close the gate! - Security! - I'm just doing my job! - Me too! Security! - I have three jobs! Door One, Heather. Captain Tong, we have a situation in economy class. I'd like to know when can we take off, please? I'm sorry, we're... Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain, Samuel Tong. Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts. We're about to take off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. Please fasten your seat belts. Are we really not waiting for TM? You can stay if you want to see her. Wait a minute! When you meet with or pick up someone, it's all about timing. What are you trying to say? For instance, we missed the flight, and it was my fault. Board the plane, take the pills, turn off the lights, wake up, and get to work. We will leave right after the press conference. Whose fault is that? It's all Sam Tong, Tong Yik Sum's fault for not waiting for us. I ran a background check on him. Besides murder and arson, you have any idea how to teach him a lesson, TM? What else? Beat him up every time you see him. Good idea! I know someone who can do that. You can do amazing aerobatics! The avalanche and the shoulder roll. Just who are you trying to impress? How is it fun if you don't pull out all the stops? Do you want to try it out? I fly planes for only one reason, and that is to take the passengers to their destinations safely. The thrill is not my cup of tea. That's the reason I bought Skylette. As the top Chinese pilot, you always make sure everyone is safe. But I also want my passengers to have fun when they fly with us. I came up with some promotional ideas to position Skylette as the best airline. In order to enhance our in-flight service quality, I'll provide 3D movies. In order to satisfy the needs of our international passengers, I'll provide international cuisines. I have interviewed many of our passengers. The one thing they hate the most is, when they're watching a movie, they get interrupted by the captain speaking. That will never happen on a Skylette flight again. Do you always put so much sauce on your food? The steamed chicken is tasteless. It's tasteless without the sauce. Tasteless! The staff will get shares based on their years of service. Someone like you will get onto the Board of Directors. I'm going to shoot a commercial. I've signed a superstar as the spokesperson. I hope you can be the consultant for the commercial. Now I can see why you put so much sauce on your food. There's nothing in your life except for work. It's dull and dry. Someone who leads such a dull life finds everything that he eats tasteless. Jayden. Everything you see is designed by my cousin. Thomas. Tony. Captain Cool. Hello! Let's take a look at our flight plan. When we reach 10,000 feet, we should pop the champagne, unbuckle the seat belts and start to party. After you put the plane on autopilot, you're welcome to join our party. Party! Please return to your seats. We will be taking off shortly. The party starts after the plane takes off. Don't let your fun become someone else's pain. Please return to your seats and buckle up. Jayden. When we land in England, you can stay at my house. I'll introduce you to some friends. See you in England. You're not coming with us? I have things to do tonight. So I'm taking a later flight. Please get off the plane if you're not a passenger. We will be taking off shortly. How long has it been? How long? The last time I saw you was in Rome. You saw me holding hands with a girl on the street, you came over and slapped me. That was the last time I saw you. Why does this happen to me all the time? I always run into heartbreakers like you. We are both at fault, you can't blame me for everything. You need to make a self-criticism. Why should I? I have been more than accommodating. I just want to find a man who doesn't treat me like I'm transparent. Someone who cares about me. You can do that, but you have to wait. Don't tell me you don't know you're on the waiting list. Be it as a person or as a lover, you must know your role in life. If your role is to wait, then you must wait. You can't rush it. If you don't, you won't get anything. Just wait... and wait... and wait some more. Who knows, you might just get upgraded. Don't cry. At least keep it down. Are you crying? No, I'm not crying. I just have watery eyes. Nothing can make me cry. - Thank you. - Okay. This is Captain Tong, the consultant on aviation technology for the commercial, and also the senior Chinese pilot of our airline. He is my mentor, Tong Yik Sum. You can call him Sam. Go get ready! I've been looking for you. Can we stop for a bit? This is not right! Just a question, who's in control? The director. Who is the pilot taking control of the flight? I need to point out a few things. If she's in charge, then she's the captain. The captain always sits on the left. Even if you authorize him to be the pilot flying the plane, you can't swap your seats. - Also, we're 10,000 feet above ground... - Sam. This is just a commercial. Right, it's just a commercial! Can we start now? Can I ask you something, Director? What are they doing? Are you trying to show that... They are taking off. I really think that we should stop. That's not how it's done, it looks fake! The experts will laugh at us! Please, Director? Why did you stop us? Flying a plane is not like driving a car, you can't just look out the window. You must check the readings on the meters. We always look out the window for a moment, - and then look straight ahead. - Sam. Why don't you show us how it's done? You'll definitely get it right. Good idea. I'm just the consultant. I won't appear in front of the camera. You won't. We will swap your face. Can we take off the hat? We never wear it. We wear a headset, to communicate with the tower to ensure the passengers' safety. The point of the commercial is to look cool. But I'm not wearing it. When the commercial goes on air, - I'll be the laughing stock. - Nobody can see you. We will swap your face. Give him a hat in post-production. Just read those lines. All right, let's do it. Put away the desk. Let's do the dance scene, okay? Hurry up! Get rid of the desk! Branson, where are you? Get over here and fill in for me, now. I can't stand what's going on around here and the panel that they're using. Please! Or else you will be sorry! You're so careless! Slow down. Take it easy. Be careful! - Here. - No, this won't work. Here? - Shall I get you some painkillers? - Go get them. Here? Is it better? No, not there! It's right here! Who are you? I'm the bodyguard. I'm sorry! Help her over here. Slowly and gently! You must relax if you hurt your back. You're doing something very simple, and yet you still got yourself hurt. That shows you're very tired. The first thing you should do is to relax your dorsal muscle. Then, locate the yao yang guan acupuncture point, which is at the L4 vertebrae, and press it like this. Go ahead and scream if it hurts. Screaming can ease the pain and help you relax. Okay, let's do this again. I thought rock and roll singers like you always scream on stage. Let's try this again, okay? Are you really okay, TM? We will continue if you're okay. Okay? Come with us. Why me? I'm only filling in for the flying part. We dropped the guy, would it hurt you if you helped us out? You didn't have to hit me just because I refused. I said I'd beat you up every time I see you. Thanks, anyway. Come help us finish the shoot. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. One, two, three... Is that all? The male and female leads should interact, right? - How about letting them wipe the windows? - That's great! No... Let me show you. Five, six, seven, and eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. Aren't we wiping windows? Come here, let me show you. Stand over here and pretend that you're a wall. Don't move. Ram into it, then back down. Ram into it, then back down. Get it? Now, pretend that I'm a wall. Ram into it. Ram into it, then back down. Closer, then back down. Ram into it, then back down. Go home and practice. TM, we need to go, we have things to do. Excuse me. Thank you, everyone! Let's call it a day, everyone! Hey. Dumpling? Why are you mad at me? Locate the yao yang guan acupressure point, which is at the L4 vertebrae. TM, do you believe in love at first sight? What about everlasting love? Do you believe in destiny? Have you tried a long-distance relationship? People talk about astrology and the Enneagram nowadays. Do you believe in those, too? So TM, why aren't you dating anyone? Go ahead and scream if it hurts. Screaming can ease the pain and help you relax. Let me show you. Stand over here. Now, pretend that I'm a wall. Ram into me. Ram into it, then back down. Ram into it. - I can't do this! - What about me? I'm tired, do you understand? - I need time off! - Darn it! - I need a vacation, get it? - Yes. - Do you understand? - Yes, I do. You want time off, a vacation. - When? - Well, finish this job first then. What are we doing today? We're shooting the cockpit scene. Where's the table? You broke it yesterday. We will put it back with CGI. What about TM? Is she CGI as well? She can't make it because she's not feeling well. We will shoot your part first. How should I address you today, Boss? Call me Captain Branson. Relax! Just act normally. Ann, what are you doing? Nothing, it's Captain Branson's first day. I thought we should do something, so I'm giving him a present. Are you trying to tell him you want to be his wife? No, it's just common courtesy. Courtesy? If it's a courtesy, then you should give him these. Heather, you already have Roy. It's common courtesy. What about you? I have no one. Really? Hi, Heather! Captain Branson, I know this is your first Skylette flight. We have something for you, I hope you'll like it. Do any hanky-pankies happen inside the cockpit? Not really. Do you know why a woman gives chocolates to her lover? To make him fat, so he can't go after someone else? No. It means "sweetheart." She gives the man her heart, and after he eats it, they will be together forever. So if he falls in love with someone else, would his heart have to be surgically removed? I don't know. This is the first and last time I will make chocolate. I think that should last me a lifetime. You're as dark as chocolate. Don't you think so? Thanks! Do you want to eat lunch? We came all the way here for fish and chips? There's no better food in England than this. Didn't someone say that she likes to eat by the sea? Have I ever said that? Yes! It wasn't me. You're mistaken. You had plastic surgery? Can't you tell? Your plastic surgeon is skilled. I only know one girl called Sze. Though I also know a girl called A, and a girl called B. Do you still make chocolates? No. Why not? I can't finish them. I'd rather buy them now. If we eat it together, I'm sure we can finish it. Do you like it? Make your own. If you were given a choice, after retiring, would you live by the sea or in the city? Alone? Or with someone? With someone. I'd choose to live by the sea. You'll get arthritis. Why live in the city? It's more convenient. It's closer to work, and shopping is easier. But when I retire, I'll have all the time in the world. I can do whatever I want. But that's when you'll get sick. Okay, even if I'm sick, it would be quite romantic to die listening to the sound of the sea. Now, that would be an overkill of romance. What do you mean? You asked me a question! You can live in the city, and I'll live by the sea. Sorry, it's my fault, okay? Have you heard of a very moving love story called The Ferris Wheel? No. The story is about this couple who fell in love at first sight and promised to get married. But fate intervened, and the guy's father called him home to run the family business. So, he told his girlfriend that they can't get married yet. Dad wants me to go back to the US to help him run the family business. Give me some time. I'll be back after I've accomplished something, and then we will get married. Can you ride the Ferris wheel with me for one last time? When the ride stops, it will be over between us. After a while, the guy made something of himself and returned to the Ferris wheel to look for the girl. But the girl, had already fallen in love with someone else. Do you think she did the right thing? Considering the fact that the guy went away without a word, you can't blame the girl. The story happened in the 1930s during the war, and there were no communication facilities. You can't really blame the guy either. But if you were the girl, would you leave or wait? Chicken dance. - Captain Cool! - Captain Cool! Thomas! Thomas! What are you doing? Stop. It hurts... Captain Cool. What's wrong? I'm dead meat if you won't help me. What? Yes, hurry up. Captain Cool. You won't defeat me today. She's mine. Go for it! I will. Sorry about last night. I drank too much. - What? - I was impulsive. What? I have an important meeting tonight. Then you don't have to pick me up. I'll go straight to the restaurant and wait for you. What? We're having dinner tonight, remember? Right. Winnie, I'll call you after work. Can you just wait? Captain Cool, you're simply awesome! We're having a party tonight, are you coming? Are you coming? I made plans for you. - Tomorrow... - Don't you have school or work? No, I don't have one. Are you just waiting for death? I am! The party will start soon, come on. Wait! I can't, I don't have time. Hurry up! Captain Branson, there's a large cloud straight ahead. We may have turbulence. Ladies and gentlemen. The seat belt sign is on. Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belt. Please sit down. It's going to be very dangerous. Ma'am, please sit down. We're experiencing some turbulence. Be careful! Sze! Are you okay? Door One, Heather speaking! Flight crew Poon Ka Sze is injured. It's so big and nice in here. It's even nicer than a hotel room. Why didn't I get a room like this last time? You're welcome to stay here for good. You still have a sharp tongue, that means you're fine. I'm okay on the outside. I'm not sure about the inside. Does it still hurt? It does. Wise up! Captain Branson. Am I interrupting? No. We're leaving. Sorry. I came to express my deepest sympathies on behalf of the airline. I had checked with your doctor. No bone fractures, just a bump on the head, and, fortunately, no concussions. Or I should say... Fortunately, no scratches on your face or else you'll put the blame on me. I know, the doctor told me all of that. Did you come here just to tell me this? You can be so... You're lucky. You should be more careful next time. Do you expect me to sit there and watch the old lady get hurt? Given her age, if I hadn't helped her, you would be at her funeral today and not in the hospital. Fine. I know you're doing your job. Just don't be so silly again, okay? Or I'll have to worry about you again. Why are you so worried about me? I'm your boss. It's my job to care about my staff. I'm fine, boss. Thank you, boss. Can you stop with this attitude? My dearly respected boss, just exactly what attitude would you like me to have? I'll try my best to oblige, boss. First of all, don't frown. That's right, try to be more cheerful. Yes, but don't go overboard. Mr. Cheung! Supposedly, the seat belt sign was on, but the old lay left her seat anyway. Were there any problems with the maintenance? The old lady said she didn't see the sign, and nobody reminded her. Was that a negligence of the crew towards elderly passengers? Sorry, I have no comments for now. Let's wait for the internal report. The old lady was walking... We have no comments at the moment. Please wait for the official report. I'll explain further at a press conference. You should all leave now. That old woman is accusing me. I'll take care of it. Why didn't you defend me? The family needs Branson more than you. The only thing for him to do right now is to work hard at running the family business. Everything else will have to wait. Captain Branson. Captain Branson, can I help you? No, thank you. What is it, boss? Do you have lean pork? No. What about American ginseng? We don't have that either. Soup with lean pork and American ginseng is good for you. I'll go and take a look at it. Talk to me. You didn't talk when you should have! Why should I listen to you now? I'm used to not having you around when I need you. It was better back then. At least you told me before you left. Don't start it again, that was a separate matter. Come on, sit down. The turbulence was God's will. Neither one of us wanted that. Was it God's will back then too? Everything is man-made. There's no such thing as God's will! Your father arranged everything and you followed his orders. You can say anything you want about me. Just don't talk about my dad that way. I have the utmost respect for him. Then I'll say this. I don't ever want to see you again. Can you answer me? Why do we have Beijing, Nanjing, and Tokyo, but no Xijing? Three, two, one! Because Xuanzang took it on his "journey to the west." Here's another one. One day, a match was home alone. His head became very itchy. He scratched his head and it caught on fire, so he was taken to the hospital. Tell me. What did he become? A blackhead. No! He turned into a Q-tip! Because they put bandages on his injured head. That's a good one. My turn. Each one of us has two eyes, two hands, and two legs. But why do we have only one heart? I don't know. Because the other heart is with someone else. That's why we spend our entire lives looking for the other heart that belongs to us. Have you found yours? I have one more. More? - I want to try this. - Which one? - Let's go line up. - This one? Are you kidding? It's a haunted house. I personally don't like such things. Are you scared? Don't point your finger at me! - How about I buy you ice cream? - You're scared! He's scared of the haunted house! Come on, let's do this once! Next time. - Are you really scared? Don't be! - Come on. Where are we going after this? Let's think about it. They're collecting donations! The world needs more people with a big heart to help those in need. If these can help pay for their operations, their lives won't be the same. Do you have any money? Lend me some! Here. Well? Still unhappy? Cheer up. When you're unhappy bad hormones will build up inside your body and affect your metabolism. You will become old and haggard. So, don't be unhappy. You're exaggerating. Do you know a method of detoxifying? Eat. Eat a lot. Trust me. WHAT? You'll get fat when you eat a lot. Then you'll want to lose weight. You must exercise in order to lose weight. When you exercise, your brain will produce endorphins, which can make you happy. Eat, get fat, exercise, and get endorphins. Don't forget! Where are you? Right here! Do you want to buy me dinner? Are you kidding me? You're in England. What are you doing there? I'm going to check-in at the airport right now. Are you really available to have dinner with me? Sam, where are you? Sam, where are you? I'm on my way. I'm at Immigration right now. Wait for me. I'll be right there! Sam, where are you? Sam, where are you? How did you arrive so fast? What plane did you take? Concorde. It's several times faster than an ordinary aircraft. At 15,000 meters in the sky, it can fly at 2.02 times the speed of sound. It's pretty awesome! It takes only three and a half hours to get to Paris from New York. But it was retired in 2003. Why do you call yourself TM? I'm hungry for money. I want to get rich. I want to earn ten million bucks. Ten million. When my parents split up, I wanted to know why. So, I told them to, "tell me." That's why it's "TM." Are you getting... a bit of confused? My ex-boyfriend was with a band in Beijing. The heavy metal kind. When I was 26, he proposed to me. I was so excited. I insisted we go out, buy beer to celebrate. We barely went two blocks when our motorbike crashed into a taxi. The taxi was fine. The taxi driver was fine. I was fine. The motorbike was fine. But he was a bloody mess. He was still sitting on the bike when he yelled, "That mother..." He couldn't even say the word "fucker." I stared at him, I'm afraid that one day I'd forget him. "That mother..." was the last thing he said to me. Now you know. Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why then, oh, why can't I? The pool is brand new, though, it's a bit too narrow. I need it to get used to living by the sea. Why don't you use the bathtub? You need to go through so much trouble. You're so unromantic! I want to take a dip with you. Will history repeat itself? History really cannot be changed. My dad is the person I respect the most. Whatever he wants me to do, I'll do my best to make it come true. I'll be a capable and responsible man. I am not yet successful in achieving that, but, trust me, I can do it. I want you right here with me, so I can be a responsible man. That's enough! Are you okay? Are you free on the 17th next month? I'm working on the merger, but it's your birthday. So, I'll be there no matter how busy I am. I promise. I can afford to lose the world, but I cannot afford to lose you. Are you all right, Sam? Perfect timing. Is there a problem? No, you told me that a pilot must arrive early to get ready because hundreds of lives are at stake. Are you ready, then? Yes! What's wrong, Heather? He proposed again, for the third time! Why won't you marry him? Why should I? I've done it before. People change after they get married. But Roy will keep waiting for you. It's not easy to wait for someone. This way. He's waiting for you. Please sit down! Here, Sze. Try the newly brewed pu'er tea. I can't believe that you waited so long for him. What's wrong? Don't be scared. I'm just sick. - Tomorrow... - Don't you have school or work? No, I don't have one. Are you just waiting for death? I am! I can't wait, I don't have time. Do you believe that watching the windmill turn will bring good luck? I made a wish last time, watched it turn around, and then I met you. That's why I must keep believing. People are strange. They pray for good luck no matter what. Don't you need treatment? Of course, I do. I was in the hospital for a year. I tried everything, but nothing really worked. In the beginning, the doctor told me I had a 70 percent chance of recovery. But, I ended up in the 30 percent. It's not a matter of treatment. It's a matter of bad luck. I didn't want to lie in bed and wait. So, I ran away from the hospital. I want to do the things I like doing and love the people I love. Captain Cool, I won't cling on to you for long. I'll disappear very soon. I'm only one of the many women in your life. But you're my last. No! I think you're lucky. If you weren't, you wouldn't have run into me. Really? Yes! I'm going to undergo a surgery to remove my brain tumor. The doctor said I only have a 40 percent chance of surviving it. So, I really need a lot of luck. Let me tell you a secret. I'm actually the luckiest man on Earth. You don't believe me? I can prove it. Whichever horse you pick will win for sure. I swear. I'll pick... that one! It will definitely win. It will win because I say so. Do you believe me? I believe you. I had placed the bet. - Let me see. - No, put it away. Come on! You lost. Why are you so excited? Says who? You bet on the winning horse! I told you, the horse you pick will win. You really have a good luck! Captain Cool. Don't worry, my good luck will rub off onto you. You will be fine, do you hear me? Good morning. Good morning. For you. For you. It's an egg sandwich. Mine too. Sam, you did okay! You must have been practicing! The director wanted me to tell you that after the last shot, you can go home. That early? No, everyone goes home. We won't be seeing you again. Now, we need a shot of TM waking up. When you wake up, look at each other and hold hands, understand? Let's roll. TM, rest your head on Sam's thigh. Thank you. Okay, that's all folks! TM, go change and we can go. Branson. Long time no see. Right. I don't quite get it. The lawyer asked me if both companies would benefit from this. Winnie! A delivery for you. What is it? One, two, three! Again! Are you okay? This... My turn! My turn! Yes! Come one, hurry up! Again. You already used up your magic. It's time to refill it at school. Captain Cool will go with you. Thanks for coming to the JetPlus and Skylette merger. Today is the day my dream comes true. I get to work with the man I admire, and make a name for ourselves. I can assure you I will do my best to make SkyPlus a new force in the airline business. Let's give a big round of applause to the man I have always respected, Branson! First, I must thank Tony for his compliment. I'm really not that influential but he was right about one thing. The merger of two companies is just like bringing two strangers together. It's an impossible mission. We went through different stages. There's the honeymoon stage, then surmise. Warmth. Adjustment. Trials. And, forbearance. During the time when it was most painful, I wanted to give up. I went to every corner of the world, looking high and low for someone who was compatible, only to find that someone right here beside me. A promise is about the trust between two people. On behalf of SkyPlus, I promise all of you that we will become the most popular airline in this business. All the passengers will choose our airline. You kept your promise to me. What about your other promise? Go! Chocolate! Hurry! Don't go! Chocolate! Hurry. Don't go! Excuse me. Got you! I missed my chance once, and had taken too many wrong turns. I'm not letting go this time. WHERE ARE YOU? I'M STILL IN A MEETING, DON'T WAIT FOR ME. Ladies and gentlemen, the plane is about to take off, please fasten your seat belts. Didn't you hear the broadcast? Please fasten your seat belt. I thought you were in a meeting. I was. But now, I have something very important to tell you. I'm sorry, Winnie. I haven't given you any sense of security. Starting today, let me be your seat belt. No matter where you go, I'll always be there to protect you. Says who? Why should I listen to you? Captain Cool came to see me! I have to go in now. You have watery eyes again? You promised that you would wait for me. We will go to the haunted house. Okay? TM stands for "this moment." Of course, I have to be here because I promised you. Captain Cool. Judging by your look, I guess the surgery was a big success? I was almost scared to death. In the coming year, I wish you an abundance of wealth. May you have prosperity in the new year. Happy New Year. Wishing you the best of everything. May all your wishes come true. May you be blessed with peace and safety in all four seasons. Lastly, be it in life or at work, especially in love, we wish you - triumph in the skies! - Triumph in the skies!
