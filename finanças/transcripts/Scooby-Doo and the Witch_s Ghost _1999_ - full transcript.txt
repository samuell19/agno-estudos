ls anyone there? Early man's struggle for survival was a harsh one. Threats to his existence were everywhere. l really must switch to decaf. Fortunately, man had his greater intelligence to help him survive. lt is with the use of tools... that humans learned to overcome their savage enemies. Please move to the next exhibit. Professor! Behind you! Yikes! Stay right there! -Shaggy! -Now, Scoob! -The trap worked, Scoob! -Yeah! Give me four! -You're the man, Scoob. -You're the man. Nice going, guys. You caught 'em. Right. No problem, Freddy. But we had a little help. Who are you? l don't believe it! You're Ben Ravencroft, the famous horror writer. That's right. And let's see who they are. lt's Perkins. And Griswold. Disgruntled archaeologists from the museum's Babylonian project. They were upset with you for cutting their funding, Dr. Dean. And we would have gotten away with it, too.. . if it wasn't for this meddling writer! That's a twist! Yeah. At least he didn't call us ''kids." l hate that. You beat us to the punch, Mr. Ravencroft. Sorry, l didn't mean to upstage you. So what were you doing here? l was doing research on my latest novel.. . when l saw the archaeologists acting suspiciously.. . and decided to investigate. Mr. Ravencroft, l am a huge fan of your work. l've read all your books, which in my opinion.. . are the best horror stories ever written. Thanks, Velma. You know my name? And Daphne's and Fred's. And Scooby and Shaggy, of course. l've admired your work unraveling supernatural mysteries.. . for some time now. We're in the same business of ''mystery and the occult." Right? Please. What we do pales in comparison with the sheer palpable fright of your novels. -l wouldn't say that. -Take The Dead Mall, for example. That creepy jewelry-store owner was an incredibly complex character. You're very kind. Listen, Velma, l'm going back to my hometown.. . in Massachusetts this weekend.. . to the house where l wrote my early books. l go back every year for the fall color. lt's very peaceful and relaxing. Why don't you and your friends come visit? Really? That would be great, wouldn't it, gang? Yeah. We could use a break from all these spooky mysteries. And Oakhaven does have one of the best restaurants in New England. -We're sold, eh, Scoob? -Yeah! This color is spectacular, right, guys? -Amazing! -Yeah! Don't forget me, old buddy. And that scene at the end.. . where the caretaker's flesh dissolved was so brilliant l-- Look, we're here. Already? Welcome to Oakhaven! What? l thought you said this was a quiet little town. lt was. This is a pretty popular spot. Sure, we always get a few leaf peepers, but never like this. This is a circus! There's the mayor. He'll know what's going on! -Maybe he'll know a place to eat! -Yeah! Welcome to old Oakhaven! Have a wonderful time! So glad you could come! Mayor! Mayor Corey! Ben, my boy! l'm glad you could come home to see this! And l see you've brought some friends. And their dog. Dog? Where? Welcome. The more the merrier. But what is all this? lt's great, isn't it? Business is booming. Not like a few months ago.. . when it was slower than maple syrup on a cold day! -Hey, Ben. -Hi, Mr. McKnight. Welcome home. Have a T-shirt before my store sells out! -You can wear it to the concert tomorrow. -Concert? The Hex Girls. -You've heard of them, Fred? -Just now. A local group. You'll like 'em. Kind of spooky. ''l Met The Ghost of Oakhaven (and lived)''? Ghost? Jinkies, looks like there's a ghost in your own backyard, Ben. Not only that, but it's his own ancestor. The ghost of Sarah Ravencroft. That's ridiculous. l thought we'd gotten past all this witch nonsense. What can l say, Ben. Ever since we built our ''Puritan Village''.. . her ghost has appeared many times. Don't tell me. You disturbed her spirit with the construction. And now, she's haunting the town. How did you know? -Ghost hunting's our specialty. -l see. Did you say, ''Puritan Village''? What you're seeing is a perfect re-creation of what life was like back in the 1600s.. . as reenacted by our locals. When did all this go up? About six months ago. This is amazing, Mayor! Corn husk dolls! -Aren't they cute? -Yeah, charming. Look, Scoob. l've been a bad boy. Wouldst thou like to churn? lt's your turn to churn the butter, old buddy. Now all we need is the popcorn. So you say a ghost has been appearing here? That's right, young lady. Apparently we disturbed the spirit.. . of Ben's ancestor, who was persecuted as a witch.. . way back in 1657. Unjustly persecuted. Sarah Ravencroft was a medicine woman who practiced natural healing.. . and was unfairly accused because of her eccentric ways. Just like the Salem witch trials. Many men and women who were a bit different.. . or didn't conform to the codes of the colony suffered the same fate. Sarah was a healer. lt was said she even kept a journal of all the patients.. . she cured with her herbal remedies. Look, Shaggy! lt's a perfect fit, Scoob! Easy, Scoob. What do you got there, old buddy? l don't know! Wonder what this is. Looks like you've found an old shoe buckle, my boy. Probably over 400 years old. Cool. Look for another one, so l can have a matching pair. Okay. We've found all sorts of items from the old colony.. . when we cleared this area for construction. Handmade nails, horseshoes, farm equipment. -How about a book? -A book? You know how long l've been searching for Sarah's journal.. . to officially clear our family name. Sorry, Ben. Nothing like that. What makes you think it's Sarah's ghost haunting this place? Because the ghost said so. Maybe you'll see her tonight. -Oh, boy. -You never know, Fred. We'd like to see a Puritan pizza joint. We're starved! Yeah! Don't worry, boys. We've got the best restaurant in all New England. lt's back in town. l'll walk you there. Do you kids want to go, or would you like to see my studio? Would we ever. Shaggy, we'll meet up with you later. Mayor, tell Jack that anything they order is on me. -What a great guy! -Yeah, great! You're gonna regret that offer, Ben. Jack's gonna take good care of you, boys. You're gonna love his cooking. l'm sure we will, Your Honor. -Enjoy your stay at Oakhaven. -Thanks, your dudeness. -Well, boys. Are you hungry? -Man, are we ever. Come on over here to the back. l always have a table open for VlPs! Groovy! Come on, Scoob! You're Mr. Ravencroft's guests, so order up anything on the menu, boys. l've got a nice, juicy ham bone for your dog. -What do you think? -Bones? Yuck! Scooby's allergic to bones. We'll have whatever that great smell is! That's Yankee pot roast, New England clam chowder.. . maple-baked ham and beans, roast turkey.. . with chestnut stuffing, and apple-cinnamon pie. Sounds great. Give us two orders of everything. l love people who love to eat. So this is where it all started! Yes, l wrote all my early novels here. Now l spend most of my time in Europe. But l come back once a year to recharge my batteries. Go ahead, Velma. Sit down. Jinkies! This is a dream come true. -You have some cool things here, Ben. -l'll say. Whose portrait is this? This is Sarah Ravencroft. l think it was painted by a grateful patient. Of course, she wasn't very popular with the town's doctors. Sarah was untraditional in her approach to medicine. -She was a Wiccan. -Say what? l've read about them. Wiccans were people who were in tune... with the forces of nature, and used them for healing purposes. Exactly. She believed in using herbs and other natural elements... to draw from the earth's powers to heal the sick. Sarah helped many people who could not afford medical treatment. She treated her patients under a large oak tree... which she believed to have healing powers. l saw a huge oak tree like that in the town square. l've already searched the area around that tree, but never found anything. That book could finally prove Sarah's innocence.. . and that she was a Wiccan, not an evil witch. Wiccans have been misunderstood, accused of sorcery. ln fact, the word ''witch'' comes from ''Wicca." l'm impressed, Velma. You know, doing research on Sarah and the Wiccans.. . led me to read almost everything on the world of superstition. That's how l started writing stories to frighten people. l've never seen anything like this. Are you at least tasting my food? lt's the best food we've ever had. Delicious! So, how's the food? Pretty darn good! ls there anything left in the kitchen? l'll be right back, boys. l've got to make a run to the market. lt's getting dark, guys. Let's go see if that ghost will make an appearance. We'd love to, but we haven't had our dessert yet. Yeah, yeah! Okay, but after you finish, meet us at the Puritan Village. Ben's already gone ahead. lf the ghost gets there first, just start screaming without us. Come on, we've been waiting an hour. The ghost is a no-show. Maybe she'll show up at the concert tomorrow. Too bad. l was hoping to have a little chat with my ghostly ancestor. l wanted to ask her where she hid her journal. -Ben is obsessed with that book. -l'll say. We should leave, too. Let's give it a chance, Ben. Yeah, it's probably a hokey bed sheet on a wire or something. This could be funny. Thanks for everything, Jack. lt was great. Especially those last 12 pies. Glad you liked them. -Was that good eating or what, Scoob? -Yeah! Excuse me. Gee, looks like everybody's leaving. l wonder if the ghost showed up. With no one here.. . this place is almost spooky, Scoob. -Girls! -Yeah, girls! Hi, girls. Hi. l think we lost them, old buddy. And l thought there was only one ghost witch! Yeah! Anyway, with all that running we worked off that big meal. But you know, now l'm hungry again. Me, too. This town shall pay for what it did to me! lt's every coward for himself, old buddy! -What's going on, guys? -''Rhost! '' A roast? -Witch's ghost! -You saw the witch's ghost? Yeah. Can you show us where? Do we have to? She throws fireballs, man. Can you at least get off me first, Freddy? Gee, sorry, Daph. Down this street. There's no one here now. We thought we'd gotten away from the first three witches.. . when this ghost chased us from down there! First three witches? You said she threw fireballs, right? lt was like this, Velma, but a thousand times worse! -ls this the street she chased you down? -Don't remind us! Check out these branches! They were all broken from the tops of these trees! And in a perfectly straight line. This is getting interesting, Ben. -Shaggy! -Not again! What is that? Let's go see! Hit it, sisters. Zoinks! lt's the witches! Easy, guys! lt's just the Hex Girls. Thanks. What are you doing here? The concert's tomorrow. Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you Ben Ravencroft? Why? You're not gonna bite me, are you? Cool. l've always wanted to meet you. You're like one of us. Yeah, you understand what we're into. Hi. That's quite an act, Miss.. .. Thorn. This is Dusk and Luna. We're Eco-Goths. Eco-Goths? And we don't need your approval. Gee, all those explosions at the end were pretty mystifying, eh, Velma? Yeah, very mystifying. -So, where are you girls from? -Oakhaven, but we won't be here for long. We're close to cutting our first CD. Well, it's been killer meeting you. Same here. But we've got to get back to our rehearsal. Those Hex Girls seem kind of suspicious. -l'll say. -Daph and l should keep an eye on them. Gee, why is it that you always pair off with Daphne? -Well.. .. -Never mind. lt's a good idea. You two stay here. l'll take another look at where the guys saw that ghost. Come on. Let's take a look behind these trees. What are all these tire tracks doing back here? Strange. The road's back there. Right. Let's see where these tracks lead. Can't we follow them tomorrow after breakfast? l guess not. Jinkies! lt's the mayor. What's he doing here? l don't know, but we're gonna find out what's in that barn. -Scooby and Shaggy will follow the mayor. -We will? Fine. Then you search the barn, and we'll follow the mayor. On second thought, we'll take the mayor. He'll never know we're on his tail, eh, Scoob? Sorry, Scoob. There's got to be another way in here. So, Freddy, why do you always pair us up? Well, l've thought about that for the longest time, and.. . there's never been a good time to tell you. Maybe it's time that l.. . that l.. .. Hey, here they come. l think we're going to need to perform our ritual, girls. Not tonight, Thorn. My powers are weak from rehearsing. Mine, too. How about tomorrow just before the concert? Never mind. l'll do it myself. See you in the morning. Bad dreams, sisters. Bad dreams, sister Thorn. Did you hear that, Daph? Those girls have something to do with this ghost. l'm sure of it. Thorn seems like the leader. Let's follow her. Are you're sure you're not just stuck on Thorn? Just a little higher. l can't. -That's great. -Wonderful. l'm in. Velma, are you okay? Fine. Come on. -This Mayor is one busy guy. -Yeah. Okay, Willard. You take it easy, now. Young love. lt's still warm, Ben. But who would be driving it this late at night? That's the mystery. What's she up to? lf l didn't know better.. . l'd say she was a witch. He won't ditch us that easily, Scoob! -Where do you think he went, Scoob? -l don't know. How dare you disturb my resting place! This town will pay! Send them a bill. But leave us alone! -l can't see a thing without my glasses. -Me either. Oh, sorry. -Sorry. -Sorry. -Hey, what's going on? -Ask Scooby and Shaggy. -Where are they? -That's no mystery. So what happened, guys? We followed the mayor to some warehouse.. . and that ghost attacked us! He did? There goes my cherry picker theory. Cherry picker theory? Wait till you hear what we saw at Thorn's place. Hey! We were reporting first, right, Scoob? The mayor's one busy guy. Picking things up.. . and dropping things off. Like what? What is going on here? What's the big idea of running over me? As you can see, there's nothing here except a damaged wall. Sorry about that, Mayor. Scooby and Shaggy just lose it when they get scared. ln fact, l'm worried that staying in Oakhaven.. . might just be too frightening an experience for them. l think we should leave. Really? l'm sorry to hear that. But l need to get one more clue before the night is over. Then l think l can solve the mystery of the witch's ghost.. . before tomorrow's Autumn Fest. Great. l'll do anything l can to help. l should've known leaving wasn't an option. What was that all about, Velma? You've got a plan, right? Here's what we're going to do.. .. Hey! Sorry. Why'd you stop, old buddy? No one touches my keyboard! Thanks for coming, girls. We should all be home resting for the concert tomorrow. We only came because Ben asked us to. Hey, l'm just following orders. Well, what do you want? The town must pay for its foul deed! Help me! l've fallen and l can't get up! Now! Yes! You did it, guys! Okay, let's see who's behind all this. -lt's the T-shirt guy! -Mr. McKnight the pharmacist? Daddy? Hello, Sally. Your dad's the ghost? Your name is Sally? l don't believe this, Daddy. Why would you do something like this? You mean you didn't know? The girls have nothing to do with this. What in the world is going on this evening? ls that you, McKnight? Maybe l can explain. l found flash powder residue where Shag and Scoob saw the ghost. This is a device to throw the fireball, which are just wads of flash paper. He got it from his daughter's stage props. What's that? lt's the cherry picker that made the ghost fly above the trees.. . with the use of an extension device. And there's the fan that created the eerie wind. lt took more than one person to pull off this scam. lsn't that right, Jack? lt would take someone pretty strong to hoist Mr. McKnight around. You should have been making pot roast instead of cooking up trouble! -That goes for all of you! -All of you? Sure, there had to be more people involved to make this hoax work. But l, for one, am totally shocked by this deception. You can stop the charade now, Mayor. Because you're the one who made me suspicious from the beginning. l am very disappointed in you, Mayor. And all of you. For lining your pockets by dragging Sarah Ravencroft's name through the mud. So she was a real Wiccan? -That's right. -So cool. She's beautiful. Yes, l think so, too. That's why l get upset when people accuse her of being a witch. l think l owe you girls an apology for thinking you were.. .. Witches. We saw you perform some kind of ritual in your shed. Witches? We just pretend that stuff. lt's just a gimmick for our band. We're Eco-Goths. Kind of like Wiccans. Just ask Thorn. She is one. Yeah, right. Sally McKnight, one-sixteenth blood on my mother's side. That ritual you saw was just peppermint and cloves to soothe my vocal cords. You think it's easy singing this stuff? Thorn's herbal vapor is awesome. We all use it before and after every show. What about your fangs? My dad's a dentist. He outfitted the band. We knew it all along, right, Scoob? Yikes! Mayor? We've been ringing your door bell for some time and.. .. Sorry about that. l've been meaning to fix that thing for years. What's up, Mayor? l feel real bad about everything, and l wanted to apologize.. . for using your ancestor in our little publicity stunt. The tourist trade was so slow we were desperate. And you once told me that supernatural phenomena always attracts people. lt was just natural to use Sarah because.. . we accidentally dug up her grave. What grave? l'm sorry, Ben.. . but l lied to you when you asked me if we found anything of Sarah's.. . while building the Puritan Village. We did. lt was her grave marker. We found it in a bulldozed pile of dirt and rocks. -We didn't want to upset you. -But that's all we found. No bones. No book? Nothing but that grave marker. We swear, Ben. We don't even know where her grave is. lt's true. lt could be anywhere between Miller's Creek.. . and the big tree stump. Shaggy, do you still have that little shoe buckle Scooby found today? Like, this one? Here. Scooby, can you show me exactly where you found this? l think so! All these years, l was searching around the wrong oak tree. Right. l believe this is what's left of the tree where Sarah did her healing. You never even noticed it, because it was cut down hundreds of years ago. You've got to dig deeper, Scooby. How about for a Scooby Snack? No way. Two Scooby Snax? Okay! -What did you find? -''Rox! '' Rocks? A box! -Ben, are you okay? -Just a little excited. Looks kind of evil to belong to a Wiccan healer. Ben, that doesn't seem to be a journal at all. Because it isn't, Velma. lt's a spell book! You see, Sarah wasn't a Wiccan. She was, indeed, a witch! -A real witch? -Heavy. And since Sarah's blood runs in my veins.. . l guess that makes me a warlock! Warlock? The Wiccans imprisoned Sarah in her own spell book.. . and you helped me find it. You lied to me, Ben. Well, gee, l had to. l'd been searching for years. Then l read about your exploits. l knew if anyone could help me find the book... it was you and your friends. l orchestrated the whole mummy scheme... paying off the archaeologists and the security guards... just to lure you to the museum, so we could meet. l tricked you into helping me, and it worked. And you were in on Ben's plan, too. No. We're as surprised as you are. Honest. For once he's telling the truth. That stupid fake ghost was the town's idea. But it did work to my advantage. Why go through this elaborate scheme? Why not just ask us to find the book? l know why. Because if we knew what that book was, we would never have helped him. But even you can't imagine the real power of this book. No mere mortal can. You've been reading too many of your own horror stories, Ravencroft. A typical mortal response. But l am descended from a superior breed. l shall unlock the power of the imprisoned Sarah Ravencroft! -l don't like the sound of this! -Me either! Together we shall reign supreme. ''Let the evil from the past ''Breathe again with fiery blast ''Let the dark wind whip the night ''To blow away the force of light'' l know what comes next, buddy. Big trouble! ''Now l summon ancient power'' Ben, please stop! ''This is evil's finest hour'' What's the matter, Velma? Don't you like the new, improved Ben Ravencroft? No. Frankly, l don't. Well, get used to it. Leaving so soon? The party's just beginning! Help! Let us out! Daddy! How deeply moving! Can l spin a yarn, or what? How could l have ever liked your novels? Now, guys! Grab the book! -Where'd he go? -l don't know. This isn't one of your silly little mysteries. You can't solve me so easily. You won't get away with this, Ben Ravencroft! Why? Because of you meddling kids? Hey, we're not kids. But enough of this minor magic. l want to see how powerful l can really be. lt's time to summon Sarah Ravencroft! ''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry ''Bring back one who cannot die'' Are we ever glad to see you! Nice going, guys! We're going, all right. Away from Witchville! -We've got to go back for the book. -Can't we wait for the movie? You're the man, Scoob! Not the gift shop! l'm starting to get the hang of this. Well, at least we still have one tire. l'll take that. Now, where was l? ''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry ''Bring back one who cannot die ''Let the witch who perished here ''Live again and reappear! '' ln my wildest dreams.. . l could never have imagined such an imposing creature. Thank thee. Thou canst not know what my bondage hath been like. Who art thou? Ben Ravencroft. Your descendent.. . from the modern world. Modern? Not much seems to have changed. Please don't hurt us! The same pathetic peasants groveling for their puny lives. Sarah, l want to become more powerful. Like you. Thou jest. But it was l who released you. You should serve me. l serve no one! Leastwise a worm like thee. Aye, thou hast freed me.. . so l can punish the world for my long imprisonment. l shall create an era of darkness over this land. We're goners, Scoob. This isn't what l envisioned. We were supposed to rule the world together. Not destroy it. l care not for thy whims. Cross my path and l shall destroy thee along with thy world. But l have the book! And l will return you back into the book. ''Ancient evil get thee hence ''Only good can recompense All that's good--'' Thinkest thou art a Wiccan? Only a virtuous soul can imprison me. Let me out! l've got an idea, guys. But we still need that book. Not again. l'm sorry, guys, but you two are the fastest. No way! Don't worry. We'll create a diversion for you. No way! How about for a whole box of Scooby Snax? -A whole box? -A whole box? Good luck. Hey, broom rider! Over here! Thou shalt pay for thine impudence! l guess snack time's over! Four hundred years hasn't helped your aim, lady! Thy mockery shall be thy last! No! Let me out! This is almost too easy! The book cannot help thee! Do my bidding, bird! Get them ! A turkey? Even we're not scared of that! Now we are! Daphne! Don't worry! Help! Jinkies! l believe thou hast something that is mine! -Got the stuffing, Scoob? -Yeah! Time to baste this bird! l guess he didn't have the right stuff, old buddy! Wait for me, Scoob! Hurry! -Thanks! l'm out of here! -Yeah, that witch is the real thing. -Wait, Thorn. We need your help. -Me? What can l do? We need you to read that spell to defeat Sarah Ravencroft. Are you crazy? l told you.. . l'm not really a witch. l can't help you against her! But you said you were part Wiccan, right? Only one-sixteenth. lt doesn't matter. You still have Wiccan blood. Which means only you can read the spell that will send Sarah Ravencroft.. . back where she came from. Forget it. You don't even have the book. No, Scooby does. Scooby! Over here! Give me my book, meddling hound! Hound? Where? Let my buddy go, you creepy crone! What was that? You're not melting. lt worked in The Wizard of Oz! Fool! l shall destroy thee! The book! l'll hold that for you. Bring me the book! Scoob! Enough! Yikes! Here's the spell. lt's up to you, Thorn. The book is useless to a mere mortal. But not to a Wiccan. Nay! l'll stop thee myself! Hurry, Thorn! Read! ''Ancient evil get thee hence ''Only good can recompense For the misdeeds that you've done ''Witch, return from whence you've come! '' Thorn! lt's working! Not again! l won't go back alone! Ben Ravencroft's last book is one the world will never buy. Thank goodness. lt would have been a hot best-seller. Daddy! -Are you okay? -You're the one l was worried about. But you did it. l guess you are a witch after all. A Wiccan, Daddy, a Wiccan. This is a disaster! No witch, no village. What are we gonna do for our Autumn Fest? Well, you still have the Hex Girls. No offense, girls, but l think we need a bigger attraction. Mayor.. .. Scooby Dooby Doo! Subtitles conformed by SOFTlTLER English Like, hey, gang. Shaggy here. Me and Scooby are putting the finishing touches... on our new movie, Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost. And what's better than some behind-the-scenes action... to wet your whistle for what's going to be the grooviest movie of the year? -You're the man, Scoob! -You're the man. Now that's Bill Hanna along with Joe Barbera... and lwao Takamoto, the creators ofScooby-Doo. We didn't know we had a hit until we put the dog in. That's the secret: Get a dog, get a hit show. As l was saying... there are lots of folks who work behind the scenes... from writers, producers... Mummy #1 takes it and smacks it with the battle-axe. ...to animators and musicians. Take our pal Billy Ray Cyrus, for example. Zoinks! Scooby, is that who l think it is? Yeah, that's Tim Curry. Ben Ravencroft is a horror mystery writer. l mean, basically, we're in the same business.. . of ''mystery and the occult." Right? As the story unfolds... and unravels, so does he unravel. He's revealed as a warlock. ''This is evil's finest hour'' l want my five minutes, okay? Now that's Frank Welker, the voice of Freddy. He's been with us since the beginning. l'm the only one, really, who has a driver's license. Somebody has to drive the Mystery Machine. Gee, why is it that you always pair off with Daphne, Fred? Well.. .. lf she wasn't there, there wouldn't be any fun. -Oh, boy. -You never know, Fred. ln this episode, Velma gets kind of a romantic episode... with Ben, which is her first moment of love. That's the mystery. l had a crush on Shaggy. Like, that's my kind of girl! Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's is one of the Hex Girls. Those Hex Girls seem kind of suspicious. l'll say. Let's face it. Scooby-Doo is the star of the show. That's right. Thanks, Scott. Like, Scott lnnes is the voice of Scooby... Yeah. ...and me, and an all-around swell guy. Yeah. lt's almost as much fun as a Scooby Snack with the works! Scooby Snax! l can't do it. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? -Two Scooby Snax? -Scooby-Doo. Like, this has been out of sight. Now Scooby and l have to go put some finishing touches on our masterpiece. Yeah, our masterpiece. Leaving so soon? The party's just beginning! English
