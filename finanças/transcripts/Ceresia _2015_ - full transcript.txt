[birds chirping] [ambient instrumental music] - Hey. Oh shit, ow. Ah god. - Are you okay? - I think so. - Uh, you're bleeding. - Yeah. Straight from my heart. - I'm a nurse, let me at least bandage this up or something. Okay? - Okay. - You might need stitches. - Oh, it's just a scratch. - Yeah, but it could get infected or something. You should probably go to a clinic or a hospital. - I'm okay, thank you. - New York rugged hipster type, huh? - Alright, fine. I'll go to see a doctor. - [Woman] Thank you. - I'm Eddie, by the way. - [Woman] Oh. - What's your name? - I'm Leila. - [Eddie] Leila. - Were you following me? - No. I'm sorry, you reminded me of someone but... From a long time ago. - [Voiceover] Yeah? - Yeah, sorry. - Well, um. I should probably go. - Sure. Well, thank you for your help and... Listen. Do you think I could call you? - Uh huh. Okay, good. - Ahhh. Ahhhhh. - Breathe in. And blow out fast. 140 over 90. You're just nervous. But everything else is okay, right? Nothing crazy happening you want to tell me about? - [Eddie] Besides the night sweats and delusions you mean? - I'm serious. - I'm fine, perfectly normal Doc. - You sure Edward? We are very close to getting what we need for approval. - I had my doubts about this whole trial thing but I have to admit I feel pretty damn good. I mean just feeling again is good. It's weird. But it's good. - Fantastic. Just two more weeks and with these reports, and the drug will undoubtedly be approved by the FDA. You have been such a good patient. And I know the Euphorus lab really appreciates your willingness to take part in this truly groundbreaking trial. For me, I'm just happy it's working. - Thanks. So, when do I get paid? [laughing] - Two more weeks. After that, you'll have a lifetime prescription of Ceresia and can eliminate all the other drugs you're on. And we'll get you paid. - Alright. - Are you heading out to your beach house this weekend? - Yeah, probably. - Cool, I'm going out there myself. Late season sailing lesson. Since I'll be out there, you call me if you need anything alright? - Alright. Sounds good Doc, have fun. - Thanks buddy. - Hi. Yeah, okay good. I have to go now Jerry, my sister's here. Okay? Thanks. Ciao love, bye. Hi. - God, it's so beautiful up here.- Yeah. So tell me, how was your first day in the big bad city? - It was good. - [Brown Haired Woman] Good. - Yeah, thanks for lending me your bike, Paula. You can see so much of the city that way. - Yeah, Travis got that for me a while ago. I never ride in the city, it's too dangerous. - It was fun. - [Paula] Good. - [Leila] How was your day? - Not bad. I don't love doing the drug ads, but the money is too good to pass up, so. - Well you gotta keep those reps buys peddling. - That's right. I'm so glad you're here. This is the best thing for you, you're going to have so much fun. Oh, honey. You're gonna be just fine. You did the right thing moving here. We're gonna take good care of you and you can stay here as long as you want, okay? Travis is gonna set you up. What's that about? [laughing] - Nothing. - Mhm. Okay, what's his name?

[laughing] Anyway, what about you? - Well, I was born in Oaxaca in Mexico. - Oaxaca is on the Pacific, right? - Yeah, yeah. Have you been? - No. - [Leila] Well it's so beautiful there. - You go back? - No, not very much. Basically just been in L.A. and now I'm a city girl. - Yeah, how long have you actually been in New York? - I just got here yesterday. - Mm, no way. - [Leila] Yeah. - Really? - [Leila] Yup. - Oh my god. - [Leila] Yup.- So how do you like it? - So far, so good. - Can you excuse me a sec? [strange ambient music] [baby crying] - [Voiceover] Eddie. [wind chimes clanging together] [inaudible whispering] - Sorry. - So, do you live around here? - Ever since I was seven. But I go back and forth between here and the beach. I'm in the city during the week working with a... For a laboratory. Studying... - You're like a scientist or something? - I'd like to be? For an artist, maybe. - Artist? Wow. - I draw a lot. Anyway, yeah my place is just a couple blocks. - I would love to see some of your work. - Sure. - So, you have any good stories? - This might be the best one I ever had. [laughing] So can you tell me something? - Yeah? - How is it that somebody hasn't swept you off your feet yet? You're just perfect to me. - Well, um. I was with somebody. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I was married for seven years. - It's over now? - Yeah. Yeah. - What's wrong sweetie? - This is the wrong life. - You're gonna feel so much better once this is finalized. Trust me. - Totally. - I feel ashamed. - He should too. - And now this guy I just met is asking me to go away with him to his house. - What, where? - I don't know, it's on Long Island by The Hamptons or something. - Maybe you should go. - Really? - [Paula] Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa there horsies. Listen to what you're saying here. Alright look, Leila. I know that you've had a hell of a few months but I don't know if running away with some guy having a one night stand and then going up to some beach house this fast is the best idea right now. - [Paula] Travis, rude. - No, no he's probably right. - Or grandpa, she can grab life by the horns and have the best time ever. Wash some of the blues away. This could be the best thing to happen to you. - Yeah, or this guy could be a complete psychopath or just want another roll in the hay. - [Paula] Well, they already slept together Trav, so I mean... - Yeah, and it was a pretty good night. - Oh. [laughing] - I could use another good roll in the hay.- Maybe we can meet him. - [Travis] Babe, please. - Tell her, we were fast and foolish when we first met. We knew each other a week and we went off to Hawaii for the weekend and it was passionate, and amazing. - [Travis] This is not the time. - Okay, well it was the best week of my life, so.- Well, I wouldn't mind laying out in the sun for a few days. - Yeah, and have some good sex. What is wrong with some good sex? You should follow through with this. - Nobody is getting swept away to some deserted island unless I feel right about it, is that clear? - It's Long Island, Travis. He's so dramatic. - Oh yeah, I'm the dramatic one. Hey Leila, how do you like your steak nice and bloody? [calming instrumental music] So tell me about this beach house. It sounds pretty remote, huh? - Ah, yeah. It's about a couple of hours away. Just south of The Hamptons, actually. I basically grew up there in the summers as a kid. My family has had it for years. My mother left it to me when she died. - Oh god, I'm sorry to hear that. Still, beach house growing up sure beats my youth in Cincinnati for christ's sake. You know, I would like to have something like that for our kids to enjoy some day, what do you think? Honey? - Well, I mean you're welcome to come out whenever you like. - Well tell us more about this place. - It's nice there, fairly low key. Beautiful sunsets. I think you'd really like it. - What happened to your parents? - Honey, I don't think we need to... - Oh no, it's okay. They died when I was young. And so I was moved by my great uncle to New York City for boarding school. And then I got the house when I was eighteen. - Excuse me for just one moment. - I'll be right back. - She has an irritable bowel. [vomiting and dry heaving] - [Leila] Are you okay? - He seems nice. - He is nice. - I don't know, I just... I feel, I don't think you should go with him. I feel very uneasy. - You're the one that started this whole thing. - I am so sorry but my stomach is in knots. He seems very sweet but I feel very strange. - It was amazing, it was really quite incredible. - We should probably get going. Right? - Yeah, sorry it's a bit of a drive and all that but thank you so much for having me for breakfast. And like I said you're welcome to come out whenever you like. - Ah, thanks man. Is she alright? Okay. Listen, can I get a number in case we need to get ahold of you two? - I gave Paula his number. - Oh okay, great. Well here is my card so... - Great. Great, so nice to meet you. - Oh, our pleasure. Call if you need anything and she is our guest so I only ask that you take good care of her for me. Sound good? - Yup. Okay. - Okay, I'm gonna... Have fun you two. - Ready? - Mhm. - Hey, you okay? - Did she go? - Yeah, seemed like a pretty cool guy to me. We're gonna have a baby? [laughing] - Did we just make a huge mistake? [alternative indie music] - Too fast. I just can't wait for you to see the coast, you're gonna love it, I promise. ♪ If I could see you ♪ Can I ask you a personal question? - [Leila] Sure. - Do you still believe in love?

A nice relaxing weekend is exactly what I need. - Will you leave the guy alone for christ's sake Paula? - There's something going on inside of him, I'm telling you. You know I can feel things like this. - Mhm. - Oh my god. - What? - It says he killed his mother. - Oh come on. - Look. - Oh god. Oh god that poor kid, he was seven years old and it says here that it was an accident. Come on, the media twists this shit for drama you know that. Can we just... - Travis. - Can we just go to bed? - Travis I'm... - Now please. No hormones. - Fine. [haunting instrumental music] [knocking] - [Leila] Come in. - Hey. - [Leila] Hey. - Got everything you need? - Eddie, you sure about this? Why don't we just sleep together tonight? - I think maybe we've been going a little fast. You know, we should just get some rest tonight. - One second. Hello? I'm fine, how are you? It's Paula. - Oh. - Yes, Paula relax okay? Everything is really great here. Eddie is being the perfect gentleman. Uh no, why do you? Paula can you just please, can you just drop it and relax, okay? Hey. - Oh hey. - Sorry about that. - Paula's checking up on me, huh? - Concerned like a mother I guess. [laughing] She's pregnant. - Really? - Yeah. - [Eddie] Wow. - I know. - That's great, that's fantastic. - I know, I'm so happy. I guess I'll see you in the morning. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight.

Where did you get this? - Took them from your cell phone. - You shouldn't have taken it. - You shouldn't have lied. [knocking] Um, I was calling your phone earlier. Did you hear it anywhere up here? - No. - I'm sorry about earlier, okay? I didn't mean to see that. I'm an asshole I'm sorry, I just want to...

[knocking] Leila, are you here? Leila? Hey beautiful. How's it going? - Fine. - Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier. Okay, it wasn't right for me to be digging around like that. I ran across it by accident and I just didn't have the guts to leave it alone. It wasn't right and it was none of my business. So I'm really sorry. - You're right, it's not your business. - I was angry. You know, finding out that you were still married. It was weird. - It's just a piece of paper, Eddie. - I know, I'm an idiot but... - That's right, you are an idiot. - Listen, I'm gonna make you an incredible dinner tonight to make up for it. Okay? That sound reasonable? - Better be good. - Okay. Wow. Nice dress. Please. - Thank you. Wow, I'm impressed. Where did you learn? - TV mostly. - Oh, um. I still can't find my cell phone. Do you have Paula's number? - I have Travis's card, I think he put the home number on it. - Okay, can I use your phone? - Right now? - Well, I want to call Paula she's been crazy. Hormones, pregnancy. - Right, sure of course. How about after dinner? - Oh yeah, of course that's fine. All of this looks really great, thank you. - Good. Bon appetit. I hope it's good. - Mmm. It's good. - Okay good. - It feels so good to be in your arms. It's been so long since I've felt anything. Or anyone. - Will you tell me about him? Your husband? - It's a long story, Eddie. Now that it's in the past I just... I just want to forget about it. - Well maybe I can help. - You do help. - So... Tell me about your husband. - I don't want to talk about it. - Why not? I don't understand... - [Leila] Seriously? Can we just drop it please? - I don't get it, I mean... Are you still in love with him or something? I don't understand why... - [Leila] Are you serious right now? - What are you doing? What are you doing? - I think that we should probably just go home tomorrow, okay? - Do you want to run back to your husband now? Is that what this is... - Let's just go home tonight, okay? I am so done. - Leila, Leila I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that okay? It's late, I'm really tired. I'm sorry. Can we just go to sleep? I'm sorry. - Fine. Goodnight. - What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You piece of shit. You got the perfect girl in your house, and you're fucking it up. Fuck. [ambient instrumental music] - [Voiceover] Tomorrow's a brand new day. - What the fuck? - Oh god, you're already awake. - Eddie what the fuck is this? Untie me right fucking now! - I was gonna let you go as soon as I got back... [loud screaming] Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. I'm gonna let you go, I'm gonna let you go okay? I just... I didn't want you to leave is all. That's it. - Well, I'm gonna leave right now. You're fucking sick Eddie. - [Eddie] Don't say that, come on... - Get the fuck outta my way. - We got a good thing going here, okay? Just calm down, calm down okay? Come on, please. Come on. - [Leila] Stay the fuck away from me Eddie! - You still love him, I know it. - Shit. Why would you go off with a guy you barely fucking know! Oh that's really smart Leila. - Is everything okay in there? - [Leila] Please give me my phone. - If I find it will you just promise to calm down? - If you find it you fucking asshole. Okay Eddie, I'm calm now. - Oh hey look I found it, it was behind the bed. Hey, I found it. It was just behind the bed. You want to come out now? Hey, I can explain everything. - Oh my god. Paula, Paula it's me. Paula you have to come get me now. You have to call the police. Do you know where I am? Do you know where it is? I've been trying. I think he's having a psychotic episode or something. He tied me up. I don't know, can you just get the police to triangulate the phone call or whatever they do please. I just... No, Paula! - Let me just explain. - Yes, she's over 18 officer please. Why did we let them go? Why did we let them go out that doorwithout knowing exactly where they were going? - Give me the god damn phone. - Yes, officer please... - Give me the phone. Hey, officer. 24 hours? No, no, no, no that is not possible officer. Look, she might be dead by then for all we know. Look, his name is Edward Fallon. We know he owns a house south of The Hamptons. Can't we just send out an APB or check ownership records or... I don't have an exact address, that's the point! Look, just check the records for the name Fallon and help us out here, how hard is that to do? You can act on a felony suspicion right? So she called, the phone went dead, she told us to come pick her up. Now, we think that something is very wrong here, can... Oh my god, I need to speak to your commanding officer right now. Fucking useless... - If you're gonna kill me Eddie, why don't you just get on with it? - Kill you? Leila, it's not like that. I made you something, would you eat something please? [knocking] - Help! [continual shushing] [knocking] - Shh. Hey Doc, what's up? I thought we were just gonna meet... - Did I just hear someone scream? - Yeah, it was my girlfriend she was singing in the shower. - Your girlfriend? - Yeah, my girlfriend's here. - Right. Well this is news, Ed. And I'm sorry to be so direct but I thought we talked about you not getting emotionally involved with someone during these drug trials. I told you it could have consequences that are not... - Yeah well, I mean this isn't anything emotional Doc, so you don't have to worry. Okay, we just hit it off and she came out with me okay? So what? - The hormones, Ed. She's inside? - I'm sorry, what do you want Doc? - Well, there were changes in your hormone and cortisol levels that showed up on the blood test that I thought we should talk about. - Look, hey. You're gonna be on the gravy train soon Doc, okay so good work, go have fun sailing alright? - Well look. You were under contract, and I could legally make you submit to an examination... - Listen to me, okay? I have been more than happy to play lab rat for the past few months but this shit can wait, Ethan. [groaning and grunting] I think I've been pretty cooperative with all the checkups and the whereabouts and the... Whatever, I'll see you on Monday okay? - Anyway. The real reason I stopped by was to give you this. Figured a celebration was in order, and I don't think a sip of wine would kill you. Again, I'm sorry to barge in. It's just a huge breakthrough and I don't want anything to go wrong for us down at the lab. Or for you. We're so close. [groaning and grunting] Oh no. [shushing] Holy shit. - I'm glad you stayed, Doc. I may need your help with this. - Edward! Where is he? - I don't know where he is. - Tell me exactly what the hell is going on here? - I don't know what the hell is going on here, okay I woke up like this. I think he went crazy or something. - He's not crazy. But he has had some social behavioral issues in the past, we're treating him. - You know this man? - Yes, I'm his doctor. Ethan Long. - We can fix this. We can fix this. - So, doctor. Maybe you can tell me what the fuck is going on with this lunatic. I found a whole cupboard of anti-psychotics in the bathroom. - It's a long story. - I'm a nurse. Make it fast. - He has a rare form of psychosis in which a trigger from his past, his mother's death in a house fire that he accidentally started when he was seven years old has given him great difficulty in establishing a permanent connection to a present and continuous social reality. And for that he was selected as one of a few perfect candidates for a new treatment designed to release these... - Drug trials? Don't you usually keep your subjects locked up in a lab or something? - Generally, yes. But in these trials he needs to be in his natural environment so the actual memories can be invoked. He's been in treatments of Ceresia. A drug I developed designed to pinpoint the range of these emotions and memories from his past and diffuse them. Specifically, his guilt about them. It's a drug that could possibly help millions. - So you don't think it's the drugs that set him off? - I don't know what's happened now. My guess is that this new relationship has set him off. - Oh, so it's my fucking fault now. - Hopefully we could talk him down. Whatever you do, stay with me. Okay? We'll figure it out. - Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? I promise. [coughing] - Edward, I need my inhaler. [coughing] [kettle steaming] - Does anyone take sugar or milk? - Sugar please. - Milk. - You do realize the gravity of this situation Edward. You've taken two people hostage here. It's my duty as your physician to illustrate the seriousness of this. - All you have to do is explain, Doc. Then everything goes back to normal. - Yes, that's just what I want to do but you have to help me understand what's happened. - Well, I don't know. I don't know exactly, I mean... You know how these things go, I mean people in love do crazy shit. - You're not in love Eddie. You're sick. - See what I mean by that? I don't like that. - What you need to do Eddie, you need to pull yourself together and you need to let us fucking go. - Leila please. Just stay with us here. Edward is trying to explain. - I'm not sick. Okay, I just didn't want her to leave, so. Simple enough. Would you help me here, Doc? - What do you want him to do? - He can help us, he's a doctor. That's what they do. Therapy and... - Okay, can you at least untie us? - I'm tied up. You're not, I am. I'm tied up, I'm tied up inside okay? I'd let you go, but you're just gonna run back to your husband, I know you. She doesn't care about me. You don't care about me. Nobody cares about me. - I do care about you Edward. - I care about you as well, Eddie. - Thanks. She's beautiful, isn't she Doc? Look at her. I mean you'd be a little crazy too, wouldn't you? I don't know why I got all these feelings inside, I just feel so stuck. I feel... I don't know, love sucks sometimes. Am I right? [fast mumbling] - Eddie, tying somebody up and keeping them locked in a house is not love. - What do you want me to do Eddie? - I want you to tell her. - Tell her what? - I want her to see that I'm in love with her. I've finally fallen in love, and it's amazing and it's crazy. The feelings I'm having inside are in the way. I don't know how to explain it but I feel like they're just pulling me... - Where Edward? They're pulling you where? - It'll just be a moment. - Tell me what you're feeling. - I feel like I need to make this work. You know? Let me ask you... Am I in love with her? Because I feel like I need to do whatever it is I need to do to keep her. - You're not in love with me Eddie! - Leila please! Edward, we are both medical professionals. You are showing symptoms of being very sick. We need to get you to a hospital before this gets out of control. - Well, I'm sick alright. I'm lovesick. - [Voiceover] Looks like you've had quite a few of those since I saw you last. - Well, their your drug and they seem to be making me feel again, so. - Listen to me Eddie. We've come a long way with this trial, but I'm afraid it's the drug that's causing these feelings. - Yeah go ahead, make it all about yourself why don't you. - We need to figure out what is going on with you and not get you thrown in jail before the trial is approved, so it's about both of us for damn sure! - Nothing has been done here Eddie, that cannot simply be undone. Okay, it's just the drugs that are causing you to feel... - You hear the soothing sound of this woman's voice Doc? I am a prisoner of love. - Eddie it's just these drugs, they're making you crazy. - Don't call me crazy. - [Voiceover] You okay Edward? - I need you to help us, Doc. - I'm trying to help you Ed. - God my fuckin' head fuckin' hurts! My fucking head hurts! - [Voiceover] Come in here and talk to me then. - [Eddie] Alright. - Leila, can you understand what Edward's trying to say through all this? - No. No I really can't. Eddie. Will you come sit down next to me? Eddie come sit down. What did you want to tell me? - You asked me if you loved her Ed. Let's talk about love, can we? Maybe that's a good place to start. - [{Leila] Eddie, will you come sit down next to me? Eddie come on. - I guess, if she wants. - [Voiceover] Leila? - Yes, yes I do. - [Voiceover] Okay, um. Leila I think what Eddie is trying to say is that he has somehow fallen in love with you. He seems madly in love with you as a matter of fact. - Yeah, mhm that's the problem. - What's the problem with it Ed? - I don't know, I don't know. Tell him what you told me. - What? What do you want me to tell him? - I want you to tell him why you don't love me. - [Voiceover] Edward what's happening there? - Stop, no. Don't do that! - Hold it now, calm down. Leila, calm down! Ed your lip. You're bleeding, are you okay? - Nobody cares about me Doc. But after what I've done, how could they really? [crazed laughing] - You've gotta work with me here. - I am fucking trying. - Ceresia. [haunting whispers] How you feeling buddy? - I'm fine. - [Voiceover] 183 Overbay Drive that's Fallon, yeah? Aw, thanks man I really owe you for this one. - [Voiceover] What else can we do here Ed? - [Leila] Please let us go. - Why don't you tell him about your husband? Still married. - Yes, I'm still married. I was married for seven years, I never actually signed the paperwork. I'm so sorry that my failed life is somehow now your big problem! You're unbeliveable. - See what I mean? You love her, right? - You say you love me and this is how you treat me. You don't know anything about love. You need help. You're mentally ill, Eddie. I don't deserve to be tied up and held hostage. - Leila. - Have you ever killed anyone, Leila? - Your mother, I know. - Yeah. Yeah, yup. Killed my own mother. - It was an accident, Edward. You know it wasn't your fault. These trials were specifically designed to deal with that guilt. - That's what you keep telling me Doc, and so I guess I don't feel guilty anymore. You're a huge success, congratulations Ethan. - I know what it's like to kill someone. Someone you love more than anything in the whole world. - How could you know that? - I had an abortion. - Why? - Will you still love me Eddie? - Why? Why did you do that? - We weren't happy. I didn't want to bring a child into that world. - Did your husband leave you because of that? - Yeah. Yeah he did. - Maybe she does understand. - Leila. Eddie has suffered with delusions since the incident. The doctors that treated him originally did think he was schizophrenic. He's a smart guy, but from his early teens he managed his symptoms with various anti-depressants... - Total fuck up is what he's saying. - No, you're not a fuck up Ed. But you do realize that you have taken two hostages here. You have sliced my head open pretty bad, this is very serious. - I kept you here to help us doctor, okay. Not to make me look like a fucking lunatic. I mean it was you who came knocking at my door wanting to check me out, remember? You were concerned about your precious salvation drug, fucking selfish bastard. You know, that's all these people care about. They care about their drugs and their money, they don't give a shit about me I'm a guinea pig. That's what I am. A fucking guinea pig. - Your dosing is not helping this Ed. - Well right now it's the only thing fucking helping. - And making you totally insane. - Please Edward, don't try to justify what you're doing here. The police are going to lock you up, not me. - I thought you said I was innocent. - I don't deserve this fucking nightmare, just let us go Eddie, god damn it! - I can't bear to lose another one. - You say you love her, then listen to her for christ's sake. - It's a strong feeling, love. - But you can't make her love you. [creepy instrumental music] Forgive me for saying this Eddie, but she's not your mother. [loud yell] - I don't need your help anymore. - Eddie, untie me I could help him. Untie me, untie me. I need glasses of water, and call an ambulance! - Hi, hi. Could you please send an ambulance to 183 Overbay Drive? A man is pretty badly hurt. A fucking guy, okay? Doc wake up, wake up. Wake up god damn you! Leila? Leila! I'm sorry honey, this is just... - Get away! - Relax, I swear they're coming. Maybe we're meant for each other. I mean you've hurt people, I've hurt people. Both hurt other people... - Stay the fuck away from me Eddie, I swear to god I will fucking kill you! - Almost there baby, almost there. - Stop the car, now. - Baby? Baby, baby? - There she is! Leila! - Stay right there. - Leila! - Please don't leave. - [Leila] I swear. - Please don't leave me okay, I'm sorry. - Stay away from me! - Don't you see the beauty in this? We deserve each other. - No! - Come on, come on. I'm not letting you go. - Stop it. I'm so sorry.
