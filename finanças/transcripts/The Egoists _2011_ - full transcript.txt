Hi girls. Found a better club? You mean your own! You getting wet? Of course I am! Hey, Kazu. That topless bar you go to... New World? Go and threaten them. They hid their gambling den from our gang. How much you owe gambling? Six million yen. You're such a kid. I'll pay it off for you. What do you mean? Kazu, owing that is stealing from your own gang. I'll pay it off. Want to get killed?! You're from my home town, but I can't help you. I can't protect someone... as stupid as you. Threaten, then run. Don't come back. You! Shut up! You're Japanese, make them shut up! The Egoists Beer. Get out! Hey! What's going on?! You can't do this! Get the hell out! Crap! Maria! My passport? I'll look for it, get out. Machi... Come on. - Club must be closed. - It'll survive. But those guys... They're with me. Scared you? Don't mess with me! - Sorry. - What's this?! You messing with me? I dance seriously. Don't go there! Your manager runs baseball gambling without gang approval. Gambling there ruined me. Kazu, are you yakuza? They threw me out. Wha... What? Sit here. Your feet are cold. Machi, seems you like me. Let's do it here. Wait... I'm crazy about you. Stop it! Tell me you're mine. I'll do anything if you do. Even run around Kabukicho naked. I'll kill somebody if you tell me to. We'll make out two or three times if you want. Take off with me. Take off? Take off. Hey... Take off to where? You decide. OK, anywhere. I'll go anywhere. Hey... Wait... Ask me properly. Machi, I'm really in love with you. Maybe work in Roppongi instead? But first to my home town. But why? Why choose me, not some other girl? You're the only one for me. Kazu, you were always watching me. Yeah. And I was looking at you. Machi? What's wrong? Machi? Kazu? Machi, you should sleep. Your fever dropped. They gave me this. No spoon? Tasty? Tasty. Good? I'll always be honest. Don't ever lie to me. Kazu, I love you. We'll be equals. OK, good. Equals. Machi, show just me. Kazu, I have some money saved up. I told you I wouldn't count on you for money, Machiko. We can spend it all together. It's money I earned as wages plus tips for nude dancing. Do you plan to just dance every time you run out of money? You're beautiful naked. I left everything behind, my purse and my cell phone. Machi... Equals, right? I'm home. Why so suddenly?! Trouble in Tokyo? Machi! It's OK, come in. But it's so... I'll live out here with her. She's 'Machi.' Machiko. Two units are open in the Koda building. Go check them out. Use the one you like. It's me. Regarding the Koda building... Bath. - Tatami floor. - Yeah, Tatami. It's nice. So, what does your father do? Nothing. He owns parking lots and apartments, so lives off that. He wasn't mad? I was the answer to their prayers, a child from God. You'll be the bride of God's child. Sales slip! Kazu, can you do spreadsheets? Sure can. I'll do anything. You will?! Here it is. Sir, I'm off for lunch. - How is it? - It's good. Great future wife! Beer would be good... - You lost weight? - Of course not! See you. Machi! Kazu! - Kazu! - Hey, Pi! You idiot! Out of my way! Nishi! Satoru! Hey there! - Been so long! - Working? My job, deliveries. - Deliveries? - Dumb job! Shut up! Idiot. She your wife? Machiko, 'Machi.' Machi. No way. Shut up! Hey, we're going ahead. You're too slow! Shut up! Hey, Pi! Hurry up! Out of my way! Don't put down my truck! Madam, been so long. Move out of there, that's where Kazu always sits. Get some food for them. I was wondering when you'd drop by. Madam, did you hear? Kazu has a job. Delivering alcohol. Can't believe he gets up early. Your uncle's shop? You show up every day? Of course, I'm full time. Full time! Meeting her really changed him! Hey, she'll be his bride. Machiko. 'Machi.' Machi. Kazu bringing his fiancé here... makes me feel so old. Machi's amazing, worked as a stripper in Shinjuku. Not a stripper, a topless dancer. Don't try to hide it, everybody knows. He ran off with the top girl in the place. Isn't that cool! Being the top is like being the Queen of the place. The same as me. Back when I was a geisha, I was like a Queen everywhere. A geisha? I was so popular in the old days. Are you officially married, Kazu? We will be... Your parents are opposed. Makes no difference. They are them, I am me. Machi, you also do as you like. Don't hesitate. Do what you think is best. Kazu, you should quit that job. It's no fun without you around. You'll get sick of that job, it won't last long. Your family has enough money. That's my parents' money, not mine. How are Toshiro and Masahiro? Still just getting by? They both got married. No way! They have lots of kids, can't afford to have fun. How about Akira? Akira got married too. Pi, jump in! You can do it. Jump in! It's kind of... Jump, jump, jump, jump...! What's wrong? I thought... that nobody knew me around here. Don't worry about that. Over here. You found a good husband. What?! He gets drunk every night. Good customer. I'll throw in some snacks next time. I don't like alcoholics. I live like a virgin. Here. Until next time. Hey! Why'd you go to Tokyo without me? I came back. With another woman! I hate that! Look how big it is. I'm still crazy about you. You're the one for me. Yes? Machi, you home? Machi! But Kazu isn't home. I'm starving, get me some food. You're eating bread! That's too mean! Nishi said... he wants to sleep with you. Idiot! You said that. What's Kazu up to...? He's been quite busy. He has been busy. Guess he can't get away... Frozen pilaf! Kazu, I love you! Machi, let's have this. "Please don't throw cigarette butts." - I'm home. - Welcome back. Did the guys come? Yeah. Maybe I'll get a job... Bored being a housewife? If you don't want to be alone, I'll quit my job. I take my work seriously, but nobody cares. What's wrong? Am I a good thing for you? Yeah. Hey, Kazu, stop that... Not now. You always just show up. I'm going to marry Machiko. - You mean register it? - Right. You lived off her in Shinjuku? I never accepted money from her. It'll never last. I'm working hard. So that I can support her. You skip work to meet your friends. Who told you that? Why won't you believe I'm working hard? You don't even know what hard work is. Did you meet her parents? - You haven't! - Machi has no parents. Relatives? Don't know. I can give you money. But send her back to Tokyo. Huh? I said to send her back! Kazu, no! Kazu... Back off. You don't know what you're doing. Thank you for the meal. Thank you. Looks like it'll rain. Machi, how about karaoke? She's going to have dinner with Kazu's parents. I see. I'm going now. Kazu is late. Look. I received this and the café... from Kazu's grandfather. She's "Camille". There was a movie version long ago. Camille was a high-class Parisian courtesan. Armand was a wealthy country boy. A heart-breaking story of love between different classes. When I acted like Camille in the guest parlor, and put a camellia in my hair, my Armand began to laugh. Did he look like Kazu? Exactly like him! His voice and everything, exactly the same. No man is his match. All other men pale in comparison. But this is your treasure... Please take it. Kazu, wait! They aren't my parents. Where are we going? To my home, the two of us. I won't go! Go and say what? That we'll stay together! What did your parents say to you? Let's go back, Kazu. You'll dance again? Tell me what they said. They criticized you? Because I'm a dancer? Let's go back. No one can understand us here. In Tokyo no one will bother us. Kazu! What's wrong?! Kazu! What's wrong? It's not serious, just a little cut. Let's go inside. Kazu, how old are you now? Twenty six. Too old to trouble your parents. Pulling a knife on your father is like being a beast. Wish you'd married my grandfather. I told him I prefer being his mistress. I don't like being restricted. Hey... The guys are coming. Coming now? Want to drink with me. Kazu... Wait... Machi... Kazu... Kazu! Hey! Huh? Do that every chance you get? Kazu, no more fooling around! Machi, drink with us! She's going to bed. We wanted Machi to join us. I'm going home. Where's Kazu? I hope at home. I'll wake him up. You'll have to be firm, or it won't work out. It's unlikely you'll ever be able to marry him. Kazu's father will try to... force Kazu to marry a woman he approves of. How can that be? Even in Japan? In the Japan... of Kazu's family. Things that are accepted in Tokyo, are not accepted out here. Why didn't you call? We were so worried. Sorry. Know where my cell phone is? No. No one knew where to send your stuff. Eat with us. Let's eat. Thanks for this. No siblings or relatives? Nobody. Maria... Yes? Will you stay with me? Who knows...? - Is it good? - Yeah. Where'll I go...? You've cheered up. A bit. You had a good time? Not really. It was the middle of nowhere. Good morning. Good morning. A customer's still here. What? Hey! - How's it going? - Good. You're really Kazu? What's with you? It's me, Yamahata. Wake up! What's going on? You had to leave Shinjuku. Yamahata... Yeah? Lend me some money. For having fun? No. I want us to have a home. - The bag. - OK. Take it. Welcome, come in. Welcome. Sir, what's wrong? Sir! Machi... Machiko! There are other guests, we'll talk over here. Machiko! Come on! Machi... Hey Mister, we mean it! Get up! You feel OK, Mister? Come here! We're serious! Let's go back. Go back with me. Kazu, go back by yourself. I can't live out there. Find yourself a normal wife. Then nobody can complain. Your father and mother will be glad. Have some kids, lead a normal life. Why do you think that? They'll never accept me. I want to be with you. I want to, but I can't. We can't be equals out there. Yes we can. No way, you're being unrealistic. No, I'm not. It's suffocating out there. You treated your parents terribly. Did you do that for me? Kazu, look at me. At my body. Look as a man. You always watched me. This body made you... pull a knife on your father? Even an animal wouldn't do that. Because I'm a dancer, you were driven to act lower than an animal? Just let me go. You'll be fine if I'm gone. I won't be! Machi... Only you will be my wife. Even though I'm not there, it would be terrible if you had an affair. So you watch out, because I'd get revenge. Congratulations! Thanks! Thank you! Thanks! Three, two, one... Take off! Well, this is a surprise! Where's Kazu? Probably with his wife. They're officially married? Tell him to come to my place. I'm not a notice board. Would you like a drink? It's your first time here. You're really worried about Kazu. You were born in the same era as your father. When people swaggered about due to pedigree and social status. Weren't those the good old days! Mrs Ninomiya... Thanks for waiting, please check the bank account details. Machiko NINOMIYA Thank you. Mr Hamaguchi, visiting clients again? Machi! I often... you know... have curry rice at Armand. You're officially married? What should I do? I hesitate to tell you, but I guess I should for your sake. About what? Kazu really owes a lot of money. To the point of life or death. You mean in Shinjuku? That's OK now. I mean after returning here. He kept playing baccarat at a club, and ended up losing everything there. Even a regular banker like me heard about it. Since when? During the time you were in Tokyo. I guess it was then. Why'd you come back? You should have run away. If I had run, Kazu and I would both suffer. Are you married? Yeah. You glad you married? Yeah. Do you want to go somewhere? Your wife? Introduce me. She's Machi. My name is Yamahata. I've known Kazu since we were this little. You really found yourself a loser. He's... a good for nothing, can only play around. His parent's are no good, same with his friends. They got together and spoiled him, flattered him, and now he's totally broke. What's that mean? Totally broke means totally broke. He has nothing. It's impossible to get money out of him. You're done. It's 4,000 yen. Machi! Don't worry about your debt, you can depend on me. I don't owe so much. I can easily pay it off. People like Yamahata always exaggerate. Were you lonely? Because I'd run away. You were lonely too. Regardless of me. I know... that I hurt you. Forgive me. Excuse me. Will this pay it off? Your order? - Cola. - OK. Won't even cover interest. I've watched you in Kabukicho. I have contacts there, so know Shinjuku well. Watched from the front row... Is that true? I've felt your legs. I'm really stingy, but wanted to feel you, so often slipped you 10,000 yen. But dancers don't recall each customer's face. Forget about Kazu. You're just part of his image. That's not true. He was too ashamed to flee Tokyo on his own, so took along a dancer who does that kind of work. Bringing home such a woman... made his parents suffer. He thought that was cool, showed her off to his friends. A country boy... coming home with a Kabukicho prize. Women find him attractive, but to me he's just a sucker. How can I pay it off? I'll do anything to help Kazu. Tell me to dance, I'll spread my legs and dance for free. How can I pay it off? You know, it's not so easy to live an ordinary life. You should be grateful for 100 yen, and work hard for 1,000 yen. You don't show up for work, and don't finish deliveries on time. If you can't, I'm done with you! I know that. Or take your wife back to Kabukicho. Everybody's laughing at me and your parents. Your wife is pitiful. People look at women like her. They think she must be sleazy. What's that?! Why is she pitiful? She isn't pitiful! Apologize to her. Kazu! Apologize to Machiko. I'm being honest! Everybody thinks so, but keeps quiet! Apologize to Machiko! You think people will forgive anything you do! You have to apologize to her! You're not grilling yet? No, you idiot. You're the idiot! I knew you'd get fired from your job. Nothing but meat. Go buy vegetables. A barbecue is meat! Kazu, here's the meat! I got the meat! Not more meat! Nothing but meat! Go buy vegetables! And 'shiitake' mushrooms. I don't want 'shiitake'! I do! Get going! Why's everybody mad? This is not fun. Everything goes wrong at once. Kazu, what about your debt? His parents will pay. Nobody pays off such dirty money. I owed six million yen back in Shinjuku. I threatened Machiko's bar to settle it. I want to do that to the casino. Let's do it! Want to do it?! What's that? The casino? They have lots of dirty money! - Are you serious? - Of course not. These guys think it's funny that I owe money. After wasting my parent's money. Kazu looked better in the past. He's stingy and troublesome. Mentioning the past again! Machiko, let's go. Wow! It feels great! Feels great. Hey, Machi. Kazu. - Machiko. - Yeah? Let's go under. OK. Kazu. Kazu? Kazu! Thank you. I can give this café... to you and Machi. Huh? I received it from your grandfather. I intended to pass it on to you someday. No way. Really? I've considered leaving this place, but it's like parting from your grandfather, so I couldn't. Kazu, take your wife and go somewhere. I only know Shinjuku and here, and I can't go there. The two of you can go anywhere. But where can I go? You're doing well, Mr. Yamahata. Because I keep working. Here. Can I completely settle Kazu's debt with this? Your lousy old place is worthless. In that case, let me play in your casino. I can win enough to settle it. Hey. 760. Place your bet. Bet received, no more bets. For the lady and for the banker. For the lady and for the banker. Show one card. Player has seven. Banker has six. Hand goes to the lady. Good evening, My name's Yui. Place your bet. Bet received, no more bets. One for the lady, one for the banker. Show lady's hand. Seven standing. Show banker. Banker has nothing. One more for the banker. Nine. Banker has nine. Deed of Ownership Deed of Ownership Nine-seven, hand goes to banker. Deed of Ownership I'll take this. Can I get more chips? Don't get carried away, grandma. Go home. My body. What are you...? How much do you think I could earn with my body? You couldn't afford it. Get out, already! I'm getting sick of you. Where's dad? Don't come around here. Where's dad? You disrespected him. Get out of the house. Aren't I your son anymore? Do you want a rice ball before you go? Thank you. Thanks a lot. What? If it's money your after, forget about it. You said that you planned to sell your property. Not for your benefit. Then let me have the building. I know you're in debt, but I've bailed you out more times than I can count. I never asked you for anything. Take care of this debt yourself. I don't care how. I have money. That's not your money. It's mine. Don't you care what happens to me? Lend me the money, please. Hey, Kazu. Hello. I'm going to go to the club soon. I can pay it back in an evening. The club isn't open to deadbeats. Yamahata, you have to put in a good word for me. I'm about to hit a streak, and then I can pay it all back. You dope. Do you think anyone is going to help you? The world is a cruel place. I said I'd pay it back. So then how come I got your wife and everyone else coming to me. Machi doesn't have anything to do with this. She said she'd pay it back. She seemed pretty confident. Don't try it. What did you do to Machi? How about if I keep her as collateral? I'd like to dip it in your wife. Go! Give me your wife, Kazu. Fuck you, I won't do it! If Kazu doesn't come home soon we can start without him. It's too much food for the two of us. You're late, Kazu! Hey. Did you see Yamahata? I asked you a question?! Yes. Don't keep secrets from me. I told you it was a small debt. You're the one keeping secrets. Is it OK for you but not for me? Wait, Kazu! Kazu, stop! Butt out! Kazu! - Stop! - What are you doing?! Stop. What's the matter?! Hey, Kazu! Calm down! Let's go outside. Machi. - Are you coming?! - Let's go. Where to?! What was that? Get in. Where are we going? Dammit! Stop! Cut it out! Hey! Stop! Give us the money! He's in here! Hurry up! How much did we get? What the fuck! Who said he had 100 million yen? There ain't a dime here. What's this? This is bad. If I were to leave you, would your dad bail you out? No one can save me but you. I'm hungry. This way. This way. This way. This way. Stop. Keep walking! Go! What are you doing?! You can never run away from your big brother. Hurry up. I think that you stole the money. We didn't do it. What?! I said we didn't do it. I think he did it. We didn't do it! I'll pay you back. Please stop. You idiot, this ain't no game. We haven't spent any of it. We had a few beers, but we can pay you for that. Come on, Satoru. Let's forget this. The money's at a store called Armand. I'll go get it. You're not going anywhere. We don't care about the money. We'll let you go if you kill him. Get up and do it like a man. I'm sorry! Hurry up! I'm sorry! Nishi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Satoru. I'm sorry. Lady, are you here? Lady! Open the door! Take a look inside. Where's Kazu? I let him go. Answer my question. What should we do? This is my joint, we can do as we please. Get ready! Let's do it. What is it? It's bad. They have Nishi and Satoru. What can we do? I know Yamahata killed them. Yamahata? He went to Armand. You have to run. I don't have any money. Stay there. Don't do anything. I have to go talk to someone. I'm coming too. They'll kill you. No one's going to kill me. They're not after me. Yamahata is after my old man's property. Machi, Everything's going to be all right. I'll be back. Kazu! Kazu! Kazu! Kazu! Why do you want to have anything to do with me anymore?! I love you! I can't help it! I can't live without you! I don't need anything else! Only you! Kazu! Don't you care about me?! Kazu! Kazu. Mama-san! Get back, it's dangerous! Sir, you have to get back! Too bad about Armand. You bastard... What am I saying? I was the one who did it. I hate you! I hate this town. I hate all of you! Why does anyone love you so much? Are you different from me somehow? Not at all! You're human trash. Give me your wife. If I give her to you, will we be square? That would be one pricey woman. I'm taking her. I want to have sex with her one last time. How about it? I'm out of here. Machi, Make me your pimp. I'd be good at it. He'd do anything to teach Machi a lesson. Fried noodles is the only thing I can cook, I hope you don't mind. All right. I don't mind eating fried noodles everyday. You'll get sick of them. I'll throw you out if I get sick of them. Me? Yes. So, what now? We run away! All right! These are our seats. Just a second, I'm going to go buy something. Leave everything to your pimp. - Kazu! - I see you in Kabukicho! To Ukishima. You lied. Liar! What did you do to that woman yesterday, Yasu? You fucked her? Did you fuck her? It's a secret? Yasu, get the pizza. OK, this is lousy. What are you doing? It's so stupid... You're an idiot. I've never seen such an idiot like you. Call your parents and ask for their help. Hey. What is it? I'll never give you Machiko! Do you have the guts to shoot? I won't give her to anyone. Machiko! Machiko! Machiko! Machiko! Dammit! Kazu! Kazu! Kazu! Machiko! Kazu! Kazu! Machiko, it hurts. Where can we go? I don't want to go anywhere. Anywhere is fine with me. Let's go somewhere where nobody else is there... Where nobody knows who we are. Someplace we've never been. We can live together again. We can have children. What's the matter? I knew it would turn out this way. You knew? I knew. I had to do it. I wouldn't have been able to see you, would I? There's nothing to worry about now. Kazu? Look at me. I've never looked away from you. Petition of Divorce Machi, I'm off. Kazu sent it. I told him to get out of Kabukicho. I never thought he would take you with him. He must have really loved you. The day you first came here, Kazu was grinning the whole time he ate breakfast. I told him that a man doesn't sit there smiling all the time. It was kind of weird. He said, "That new girl sure is pretty". He said it over and over. He was like a kid brother. He wasn't a bad guy. I should have drank sake with him to formalize it. Machi, it's your time baby. English subtitles by scannon
