You're not doing yourself any favors I'm not an actor You're perfect, the ideal Kowalski Kushemski! You're Kushemski Not exactly At your service, sir Where do we start? You choose Let's try the first scene You have your sides? They got messed up Who gave you the whole script? I dunno My agent sent it How did he get hold of it? What's the problem? It's top secret or something? Doesn't matter Have you read it? I flipped through it on the train It's like based on something The Lou Reed song? It's based on an Austrian novel, "Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch I bet you read it in actual Austrian! Well, more or less The book was a huge scandal in 1870 I bet it was, it's S&M porn It's not S&M porn It's not porn? Or porn-ish? For medieval times, like, 18-whatever? "Venus in Fur" is a great love story It's a central text of world literature Yeah? Looks like porn to me I know my sadomasochism I'm in the theatre Masochism comes from Sacher-Masoch because of this book Masochism, Masoch, I shoulda seen that So S&M is named after the guy? That wasn't his goal Sure, he called it serious, people called it porn And you milked the book? I adapted the book made up the lines, the scenes There's a lot of me in it Fantastic So where are we, like? "Like" at an inn somewhere on the edge of the Austro-Hungarian Empire The Austro-Hungarian Empire...Remind me It's complicated So it's a fancy inn, huh? Yes, a health spa for the wealthy Very luxurious At curtain-up, Kushemski is reading in his room with his morning coffee And knock-knock, Vanda enters And that's "symbolic" for his character? He's reading People still read books Books made of actual paper Ouch, you got me So this guy...What's his name? Sevran, Savrine... Severin von Kushemski Right! What is he, what's he into? Throw me some adjectives A rich idler of his times Intelligent, well-traveled, cultivated A nerd If you will "If you will." I love it! When did I last hear that? Distinguished, like you Want to know about her? I know her inside out but... Sure, if you want I'd say she's a young woman of her time Despite her professed principles Despite what? Her professed principles At first sight, she's very proper, poised and cultivated No kidding, nothing else? Anything I don't know? Like... That's cool, I'll manage Mind if I change the lights? The lights? Kinda glary, right? Oh please, make yourself at home! How's that? Not bad Hold on... I wouldn't know which button to push Much, much better I guess this is the divan Yes, that's the divan A desk The book she brings back The postcard, great And what's this? A phallic symbol? It's from the last show here A Belgian production "Stagecoach" as a musical Where do I stand? Wherever's comfortable Not so center Stage left or stage right? Left Do you want to read the scene over? Nah, let's wing it How far? To the end of page 3 And then you kick me out? Let's try that In other words, yes I nearly forgot... These words on page zero... This quote, like The epigraph? Yeah "And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands" It's quoted in the novel from the Book of Judith That's the Bible? The Apocrypha, yes I'm pretty dumb It's pretty sexist, huh? "And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands" I'm only quoting Sacher-Masoch's novel Yeah, but you put it on page zero Never mind, none of my business, I'm just an actress I forgot the fur - She wears a stole? - That's right Fur...Fur... Soft fur... Ok, that's good Maybe it's not... Ready when you are Knock-knock! Come in Herr Doktor Severin von Kushemski? I'm sorry to disturb you I'm Vanda von Dunayev I'm staying in the room above yours I found this book last night A copy of "Faust" with your bookplate inside It was in the birch grove by the statue of Venus Thank you so much I had just asked the maid about it I would have sent it but I found this provocative postcard inside A Titian, isn't it? Yes "Venus With Mirror", a favorite of mine Your Venus seems as well-thumbed as your book Is she faithful? I'm sorry? To the original Yes, it's a faithful copy of the painting I understand your fascination, the picture's ravishing Thank you for returning it I couldn't help noticing the odd poem on the back "To Venus In Fur." Did you write this? It's just a bit of doggerel... Doggerel, really? "To love and be loved "Ah, what bliss "Yet there exists a greater joy "The torment of that woman's kiss "Who makes of me her slave "Her cur, her toy "I speak of Her "My goddess, my dictator "My Venus In Fur" Interesting sentiments If I were you I'd guard this bookmark well I appreciate your discretion Would you like to sit down, Frau Dunayev? Thank you May I take your fur? That's very kind It's Tartar, isn't it? Caucasian sable, probably from Kazakhstan Caucasian sable from Kazakhstan, precisely Kushemski stares at the fur in his hands You're trembling, Herr Kushemski! Yes, please forgive me May I ring for something? A coffee would be lovely Have some of mine How kind of you Two sugars, please He pours her coffee... I hope I don't disturb you, trodding in my heels up there Not at all Trod in your heels to your heart's content So you're a poet, Herr Kushemski Just an amateur And a trained lover of fur The love of fur is... I'll skip that line No, read it! The love of fur is innate It's a passion that Nature gives us all Come on, get into it! The love of fur is innate It's a passion that Nature gives us all To caress a thick, soft fur That peculiar tingle, that electricity I suspect there's more here than a gift of Nature Perhaps your mother swaddled you in sable as a baby? I'm sorry, I'm prying Please forgive me Actually... I had an aunt who was passionate about fur That explains everything We're all easily explicable yet remain inextricable "Inextricable"? What do you mean? Life makes us what we are End of page 3! So it is That was good, Vanda I was just stumbling around You didn't seem to be That's good actin' for ya! I tell you, I'm a pro It was very good I'm blushing It wasn't perfect No. Sure Let's read on a little Then Kushemski has his big speech and we can skip to... No, read it! It'll feed my character - You're good, Thomas - I'm faking it No, you're really good Who's your Kushemski? I have a few possibilities You should play him I mean it, you'd be terrific It's hard And I put actors through this! You're the director, it's your job to torture actors First-time director You'd never know Directors never understand my work Never get it right... That's why you're perfect You can make it right I have it all in my head I'll use Alban Berg's "Lyric Suite" for transitions Great idea! You know it? No! But you see? You know it inside out, characters and all For Kushemski, off the top of my head try something... An accent or something He's upper-class Upper-class, exactly With a hint of something aristocratic Is this upper-class enough? Or is it idiotic? It is, but it's great You didn't bring a smoking jacket, did you? I did I was kidding Wanna try it on? It'll help you. I bet it fits It's beautiful Is it real? They said it's vintage "Siegfried Mueller, "Vienna, "1869..." I didn't notice 40 euros, not bad, huh? Looks like it was made for you! How's it feel? It feels good A perfect fit Sure looks good on you Hello, gorgeous! How much was the dog collar? It's from when I was a hooker Just kidding! Let me give you a run-up Perhaps your mother swaddled you in sable as a baby? I'm prying, please forgive me Actually, one of my aunts had a passion for fur... This is hard for him Obviously So go for it! I'm prying, please forgive me Actually one of my aunts had a passion for fur That explains everything We're all easily explicable yet... we remain inextricable "Inextricable"? What do you mean? Life makes us what we are in an unforeseen instant How's the coffee? I've hardly tasted it but it's excellent so far That's symbolic, right? He's the coffee One sip and she's already hooked Damn, you saw right through me Have you had an "unforeseen instant, Herr Kushemski?" Actually, I have But I don't wish to bore you Far from it, I'm enthralled It's like an English mystery novel I await the mysterious aunt who was fond of fur We can skip the next speech No, read it, I want to hear I await the mysterious aunt who was fond of fur I was an impossible child Spoiled and cruel Tormenting the servants and our cat I was also very rude to an aunt of mine The Countess was a regal woman Voluptuous and terrifying What's wrong? Nothing Feels strange, hearing out loud words I wrote on a screen at 2 am But you're doing fine What did your aunt do? One night, she took her revenge She came into my room wearing a long cape of Russian black fox fur In her hand, she carried a birch cane freshly cut She was followed by the cook and the maid She threw off her fur and rolled up her sleeves I tried to escape but the other two women grabbed me pulled down my pants and flung me onto the fur They held me down while my aunt laid into me with the cane My naked backside and thighs were on fire The servant women urged her on and mocked me, calling me a little girl I struggled but my aunt kept whipping me until I begged her to stop out of mercy When she finally stopped she forced me to thank her on my knees She made me kiss her foot Then she left the room... threatening to return All this witnessed by the two servants and our cat From that time on for me, a fur was never just a fur nor a birch cane a simple switch In that brief moment, she made me the man I am now Did she return? In my dreams, yes, with her black fur and her cane She still visits me each night You poor, poor man Poor? She taught me the most precious thing She taught you what? That nothing is more sensuous than pain Nothing more pleasurable than degradation The Countess did her work well She became my ideal I've sought her replica ever since and when I meet that woman I shall marry her Thomas, that speech is awesome! Thank you. It took a lot of work So, actually this play is, like, all about child abuse Are you crazy? What does child abuse have to do with it? This goddam mania these days! Everything's a stupid social issue! Child abuse isn't exactly stupid... I know but don't be so trite! This isn't anthropology or sociology it's a play Yeah, but... There's a lot more here than corporal punishment! Ok, sorry This impoverished world we live in! Why do we always diminish things? What's next on your list? Sexism, racism, the class struggle? You are quite unique, Herr Kushemski If I were you, I'd be careful Your ideal woman may be crueler than you care for I'm willing to risk that I know what you are. A supersensualist An ascetic voluptuary And you, Frau Vanda von Dunayev, who or what are you? I'm a pagan Meaning I'm young, beautiful, rich and plan to make the most of that I'll deny myself nothing I respect your principles Excuse me, I don't need your respect I'll love a man who pleases me and please a man who makes me happy But only as long as he makes me happy Then I'll find another Nothing is crueler than a woman's infidelity For a woman there is Enforced fidelity Can I move? Sure, move around In our society a woman's only power is through a man I'd like to see what Woman will be when she becomes Man's equal When she becomes herself Little Vanda's way ahead of her times Vanda... How do you know the lines? I dunno, I learn fast You know the play by heart! You said Vanda's very proper... despite what? Her professed principles Right She doesn't believe all this? She says so Women's rights, blahblah... So it's all an act? Why "professed principles" and not just "principles"? I liked the alliteration, "professed principles" I see You sold your soul for alliteration Guilty as charged Between you and me, Thomas, you're a bad boy If I may be so bold, I'd say you're more than a pagan, you're a goddess Really? Which one? Venus Vanda is Venus or am I crazy? She's Venus in human form come down to bust his balls Not really or not exactly Ok, I take it back. You wanted it ambivalent - Ambiguous - Right It's the same story as "The Bacchae" Exactly! What's "The Bacchae" again? Just kidding. An old play, right? A very old play, yes Citizens of Corinth! Behold this mortal man, Testiculus cursed for his offenses by the gods and totally fucked for all eternity! That kinda play? More or less Dionysus comes down and reduces the proud King of Thebes to a quaking jelly in a dress Sounds hot! After that the crazed women of Thebes, the Bacchae tear him to pieces Dionysus leaves triumphant Yeah, I think I saw it Here it's not Dionysus, it's Aphrodite And she is..? The Greek Venus - Same person? - Same goddess Hail, Aphrodite! Am I insufferably pedantic? Yeah, but it's kinda cute What're we doing? You are a goddess Really? Which one? Venus But Venus could only rule over slaves So I should find myself one Would you be my slave, Herr Doktor Kushemski? I already am I've been your slave since you entered this room What? Already in love with me? Profoundly I'm suffering as if I'd known you all my life Subjugate me Stand up and step away from me I must say you do intrigue me I like your frankness, your clarity of thought Physically, you are not unattractive But when a man submits to me, I sense a trick This is no trick. Love me! You see? Orders already Marry me I'm a frivolous woman, Herr Kushemski You'd have to be very brave to love me I explained my principles I don't care, I want you for my wife You don't know me - Dominate me - It's absurd I give you all power over me, eternally Unconditionally. Do with me what you will Dominate me, beat me if you like This is certainly novel Stand over there Stand in the center I'm fine here You should be there, you're taking power So take a power position Try it again This is certainly novel It doesn't work Try it again I give you all power over me, eternally Unconditionally. Do with me what you will Dominate me beat me if you like This is certainly novel You're not trying You wanted me here, here I am. I said my line It's only an audition I want to see if you can take direction So do as I say and stand there I give you all power over me, eternally Unconditionally. Do with me what you will Dominate me beat me if you like This is certainly novel It is better! Keep going What do you want deep down? To be your possession Vanish into your sublime essence Dress and undress you Hand you stockings, put shoes on your feet Have no will of my own You call that love? The only kind In love as in politics one partner must rule One must be the hammer, the other the anvil I willingly accept being the anvil Enough No, keep going, I love it! Thomas, the insight, especially about women You really understand women Yes, years of study - Where was I? - Being an anvil Vanda I seek pain and you pleasure You mustn't defer to anyone's feelings Use your lover as he'd use you Rule him, wring him dry You're incredible If I can't be your husband, take me as your slave Treat me with divine cruelty Mistreat a man who loves me? - I'll worship you even more - I don't want that All women want worshipping, like our Creator Create me Ruin me Annihilate me Excuse me No, I'm still here Everything's good I don't know In a few minutes, I guess I'll call when I leave Me too, honey, take care Yeah, fine Sorry The audition? We'll see I'm at the temp agency, they've got something Typing. A night job in a law firm They need the contract tomorrow... I dunno! We'll see. That's life That's life, ok Incredible... Your other half? People still say that? - What's "other half" now? - I dunno..."Asshole"? Ok... You wonder why I lied It's none of my business What does Vanda say? I'll deny myself nothing I got other fish to fuck, so to speak So you're the hammer, he's the anvil What should I say? "Whatever, baby?" This isn't love, it's sex You want sex, you take the rest That's what the play's about Is it? Are you kidding? I don't know, am I? Will you stop! Say what you think for once Quit pussyfooting around Shall I make some coffee? - What? - Are you coming on to me, Tom? Certainly not I'm just offering you coffee Symbolic coffee? Not at all, real coffee Would your wife like you offering me "real" coffee? I'm not married I thought from the call... My Fiancee Same thing. What would Fiancee think? Didn't you once say, "Theatre's a great way to get laid?" You actually read that! I was young, it was my first interview Never been married? Never Still living with Mom? I'm twisted but not that twisted So fox fur's your thing? No, love is You really are twisted And my woman must be my muse So Fiancee has wings and everything? The way I see love you take the plunge... Jump right in Head first With fireworks, lightning and thunder Coffee or no coffee? I could only give myself to one man for life if he enslaved me We're not a very good match, Herr Kushemski We cancel each other out I say we're made for each other Don't you feel that, Vanda? Don't you feel it too? I propose a trial period A contract. Call it a business deal You have one year to prove you're the man for me - A year is long... - Let me finish I beg your pardon I'll draw up a contract saying you're my slave for a year So she had this all planned She set it up before she came in You think so? C'mon, you wrote it I'm not sure she had this "planned" I'm not being coy So you wanted it ambivalent - Ambiguous - Right Maybe she's just a horny bitch I never considered that angle Maybe it's even more twisted Be my slave for a year, then you can fuck me - Ambivalent again? - Ambiguous For me, well, for Kushemski you're his last chance, his only chance Really? To do what? To live He wants to know if she's into whips - He's auditioning her - She's auditioning him too He's a perv and she's an object like every woman in 18-whatever Who are you really, Frau Vanda Jourdain? I'm a pagan No, I'm serious You're coming on to me again Where are you from, what's your story? I'm an army brat, I grew up everywhere Where, what cities, what countries? I'll draw up a contract saying you're my slave for a year Your wish is my command Give me your hand They shake hands... There's a Greek officer at the inn A Greek? He's from Athens He rides a snow-white stallion and wears black leather boots I want you to get his room number But, Vanda... Resisting already? Forgive me Wait for me tomorrow in the birch grove by Aphrodite's statue At what time? Wait until I decide to arrive Very well And don't come without the Greek's room number Now kiss my foot He kneels and kisses her foot I love that bit. Bang! "Kiss my foot" Now put my fur on me Severin... Where will all this end? That depends on you, Frau Vanda von Dunayev Not on me Thank you for the coffee, slave Yeah, I'd like some now Coffee, I mean Pretty intense. The handshake was, like, electric The joys of a repressed age Conversation itself was erotic Conversation was all they got That's not how the book starts The book? Where's the first scene? Venus naked in a fur by the fire You know the book? You've read "Venus in Fur"? I took a look When you said, "What's it based on?" you were lying Ok, to get ahead! Why didn't you keep that scene? How could I fit it in? At the start, before he meets Vanda You can't do "Venus in Fur" without Venus Same actress playing both Naked on stage? For you, no extra charge I'll think about it Let's improvise, maybe you'll get some ideas The lights Where are we, top of the play? Kushemski's room At night. Ok, middle of the night, 2 am Let's tone this down A fire going, stage left Very nice Let's see, Kushemski is doing what? I don't know. Reading Yeah, right No? Too cliche'd? He's already reading when he meets Vanda! We're not the city library He can be writing his diary I like it Ok, I'm Venus What the hell... - Imagine me naked You're a big boy Pretend I'm Fiancee and improvise I've never done it before All the girls say that But it's true The fire flickers We see Venus naked draped sensually in a fur So drape me in my fur You're the director Sensually, I said Now sit at your desk In character! Write in your diary Write for real I am Out loud! How else do we know who you are? It's the start of the play The lights are coming up All we hear is the sound of an old clock October 22nd, 1870 2:00 AM I am staying at a health spa ringed by forests and mountains There's no moon tonight Darkness and silence reign No, wait, I hear... A sparrow A nightingale The howl of a cat in heat I feel so terribly alone Unhappy Unfulfilled What... have the Germans invaded again? I hope I do not disturb Not at all Hail, Aphrodite ¤o, you haff not forgotten me? Forgotten you? My dearest and oldest enemy? You are zo sveet Von't you kiss my hand? ¤at's better, but Thomas... Did I say Thomas? Ja, but Seferin, it's zo cold in here Effry time I visit you I am catching cold You zee? Already I have pleggum in ze tubes But you always strut around naked But I am Fenus, I must be all ze time naked It comes mit ze job Von't you take off those scratchy clothes and come cuddle mit me? There's room here, under my fur No, thank you I brought zis mink especially for you >From Olympus. It's heavenly See ze label? "Made in Olympus" Why would I be interested in your fur? I know your little quirk Women don't interest you their fur does You should marry a raccoon Better a raccoon than most women I've met But if I open my thighs unter my mink you vouldn't vant some love? Is it love you're offering? No, it's power You dare to resist me? I dare I'll make you crawl at my feet I'll make you beg Never You're mine already And you'll be mine for all time Never! I'll be back Then, poof, she vanishes! Not bad, huh? You could write it up and stick it in, So to speak In theory anyhow I thought I'd add a little Marlene Dietrich Yes, great, works beautifully It shows another side of Kushemski Yeah, with Venus at night, he says "No, you bitch" Next morning with Vanda "Take me, please!" We could bring the lights down, then back up It's morning, knock-knock and Venus reappears disguised as Vanda - To get revenge - Brilliant So is it you? What? He's you Kushemski-Novachek, Novachek-Kushemski He's not me You said there's a lot of you in it Maybe you're Vanda The play has nothing to do with me You're just the writer Sorry, "adapter" Like, "If a critic says it's me, I'll kill him" I can invent characters Sure, Herr Doktor Novachek and you happened to find them in an old S&M novel It's a famous book You didn't have an "unforeseen instant" at age 12? In the library? No With a cat? No You're still waiting for your... "great moment"? I'm not waiting for anything I find the characters' relationship absolutely fascinating Very complex, very rich Of course I love the characters' emotional depth No one experiences this kind of thing nowadays We no longer see this kind of rage Meet some of my friends Ok, fine, I don't understand a thing When you get home, Fiancee doesn't tie you up and whip you? No Ask her, see if Fiancee is up for it Stop calling her "Fiancee" Sorry What does your "other half" think of the play? She's not keen People might think it's you or her It isn't me or her But let me guess about your... Marie-Cecile I bet she's younger than you. Good family Probably grew up in a pretty home on the coast Near La Baule Nantes, actually But I bet her family spent weekends at La Baule In a villa with a garden She sails She loves seafood Correct She's tall A little bossy, in a nice way Lots of hair Long legs and a nice pair of... eyes A fine mind Prep school in Paris Excellent grades, a degree a Master's? Am I close? She has a Master's She has a Ph. D. She's doing a thesis in sociology She has a dog, let's see... Maybe a Labrador named... He has an intellectual's name Bourdieu? Derrida You're very cultivated I bet she's loaded A crappy theatre, a Belgian cactus... It's not the Comedie Fran caise Her family's rich Am I right? Of course I'm right But, hey, you're an artist She loves that about you, loves your sensitivity Maybe you're the first really sensitive guy she ever met She loves books, opera, ballet, that shit At night, a foreign movie, you discuss novels before a nice quiet copulation Nothing like some quiet copulation to help you relax But a voice rumbles in the back of your mind Calling for something else I don't know what but it rumbles But, hey, you're happy You're very, very fond of her You'll have a nice quiet life watching foreign movies, discussing novels and then you'll have kids and then you'll die Shall we read on? Yes, let's read on The next day in the birch grove? All right Here's our statue of Venus Hail, Aphrodite! Hail, Aphrodite... Do you want to read the scene over? No, Severin It's not right All this talk of slavery and domination You've corrupted me with your words I think deep down you'd enjoy controlling a man No Or even torturing him No Admit it That's not me - Can't I reason with you? - Reason be damned Don't you see? You'll never be safe in the hands of a woman Of any woman That line is so sexist I could scream! What's sexist about it? You'll never be safe in the hands of a woman It's in the book So the book is sexist! No, it's not! On the contrary, it's... A central text of world literature? I didn't mean that And this? That ain't Titian, babe it's S&M porn The whole thing's one big cliche In what way? He gets spanked and suddenly he's into S&M? It happened to Sacher-Masoch! - Did it happen to you? - No! So what do you know? For me, it's a play about two people united forever They're handcuffed at the heart By perversion No, by passion His passion! This is a chemical reaction It's a sex and class war Vanda is a sweet innocent who meets a total pervert You don't understand a thing She says, "You've corrupted me" Maybe she always had this thirst for domination Maybe Kushemski brought it out Maybe she's just a woman The play's like an old anti-female tract He makes her play along, then blames her - It's not that at all - It is! How? Take the ending: she gets the Greek to whip him She dumps Kushemski, dick in hand and it's her fault when he wanted it? I think old Kushie's hot for the Greek How can you be so stupid? How can you play her so well and be so fucking stupid about her? And all the rest! Fucking idiot actress! Dumb bitch! Fucking idiot! Pain in the ass! I'm sorry What? I'm sorry, I got a little carried away What's said is said I guess the play says beware what you wish for Because she could come knocking Don't fuck with a goddess, that's what it says If you will If you will... What's modern for "if you will"? "Whatever" If you say so Good thing goddesses don't exist or you'd be fucked Fine, you're right, I take all your points Can we read on? Please, Vanda Don't you see you'll never be safe in the hands of a woman? Of any woman? You and I are adventurers, Vanda exploring the limits of human nature You're sick The Countess poisoned you, behold the effects - You love the effects, as I do - No You love having power over me No Your desires will be my orders I'll beg, I'll crawl. Make of me what you will You're a mad visionary, a fanatic You'll do anything to attain your dream You are my dream Break off with me, Severin, before it's too late Do you love me? I don't know Then find out, do something to persuade yourself How? By doing what all lovers do Make me suffer I find that repulsive and I despise playacting I am not your Countess-Aunt. I am I Try that again, defy him I am not your Countess-Aunt. I am I Again, stronger What do you want, Thomas? I'm not your fucking aunt! I am I, what do you want? I don't know This isn't about the play now I just want more I'm not her! I'm some stupid cunt who needs a job! I'm not your aunt, I am I How's that? That's good, very good I can't play this part, it's too hard for me Don't go, Vanda, please stay Beg me I beg you You're evil Don't you see you have me in your power? Liar You're not in my power, I'm in yours You say you're my slave but you dominate me That's true He says she has power but he has it, not her The more he submits, the more he controls. Weird It's complicated Here's the contract we discussed It states that you will show me absolute submission You'll be my slave You'll renounce your identity completely Your body, your soul your honor will be mine forever Sign Well? It was supposed to be one year So you're dictating the terms? May I read it? Why? Don't you trust me? Sign Good Henceforth you'll call me "Madame" and you'll speak only when I let you You'll serve me my meals and wait in the hallway for my orders You'll dress me in the morning, undress me at night Hand me my stockings, put on my shoes I'll call you "Thomas" - It's Gregor in the script - I've changed it Henceforth I'll call you "Thomas" You'll wear a footman's livery As a gentleman... As a gentleman you'll keep your word Didn't you sign a contract to be my slave? Your slave, not your valet I fail to see the difference Is this a game? This is what I am I'm stubborn, willful and greedy When I start something, I finish it The more you resist, the more I insist But at heart you're of a noble nature What do you know of my nature apart from your imaginings? Please forgive me, I'm despicable Give me your passport and your money Give them to me! We leave tomorrow for Florence I'll travel in first class, you in third Third class? You'll eat and sleep in the servants' quarters Well, Thomas, what is it? Where will all this end? End? We haven't even started But, Vanda... She slaps his face She kisses him She strokes his cheek Did that hurt, darling? Yes, exquisitely Good What have you learned about the handsome Greek? His name is Alexis, he's a Count He's beautiful, isn't he? He's very attractive I told you Kushemski's hot for the Greek Get me a box near his at the opera tonight I'll let Count Alexis seduce me But... What's the matter? Am I not free to do as I like? You electrify me Silence, you dog Bring me a birch cane He brings her a cane Do you hear that whistle? It makes my nerves vibrate like a tuning fork I want to hear you whimper under the lash To hear Herr Doktor Kushemski cry, cry like a little girl My heart pounds in my breast The air is on fire What have you done? Blah, blah, blah What, blah, blah, blah? Suddenly she's the Wicked Witch? The air is on fire, my nerves are tuning forks Why not lightning and drumrolls too? Listen, Tom, I really like you but this is way too corny Corny? Corny how? This is the play My play! It's a great play! No one will make me think othe¤ise You know nothing I won't let anyone demolish my work whether you're in it or not! Fuck you Ok, it's your call She holds a knife to his throat God, I despise you What are you doing, what is this, Vanda? You think I don't understand your game? You think you can use me, subjugate me?

You were pretending to talk to someone That was my other half - Who is this guy? - Who said it's a guy? Why did you do that? Why do you think? You didn't like me answering my phone Like female revenge, or something? Something like that, like Any other director woulda jumped me by now I'm not any other director Bullshit If you thought you could, you'd have done it Wrong What if I let you? How do you know so much about Marie-Cecile? I met her at the gym Sure... She seemed real nice Gorgeous too. Really We got talking while we were undressing Girl talk, like I said I gave up acting to be a private eye Or try to be She told me about her boyfriend A mysterious guy, a writer She paid me to look into you Find out who you are, see if you really love her A premarital fact-finding mission Your criminal record, financial situation...
