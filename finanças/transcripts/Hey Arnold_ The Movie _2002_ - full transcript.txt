ARNOLD! * COME ON. MOVE-- CLEAR, CLEAR! I'M TELLING YOU, ARNOLD, YOUR BALL IS FLAT. IT'S NOT FLAT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE LOW ON AIR. LIKE I SAID, YOUR BALL IS FLAT. MAN, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE LET THOSE FIFTH GRADERS BEAT US. WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE TRIED OUR BEST. THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE GOT OUR BUNS WHOOPED. COME ON, GERALD. WE HAD FUN. AND WE ALMOST BEAT 'EM. WHY DO YOU DO THAT, ARNOLD? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE? SOMEBODY HAS TO. MR. GREEN, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S SCHECK. HE WANTS TO BUY UP THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD... - SO HE CAN KNOCK IT DOWN AND PUT UP A FANCY MALL. THE PLAN, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE MAYOR JUST MOMENTS AGO, WOULD ALLOW FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES TO REDEVELOP... A SIX-SQUARE-BLOCK AREA BETWEEN 33rd AND 39th STREETS. OH, I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT AND C.E.O. OF FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES, MR. SCHECK, IS ABOUT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY... I'M DELIGHTED AT THE MAYOR'S SUPPORT OF OUR RENEWAL PLAN. NICE SUIT. SHH! - I AM BEHIND MR. SCHECK'S PROJECT 100%. ALTHOUGH SOME OF YOU IN THE AFFECTED AREA... MAY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS PLAN WILL IMPACT YOUR HOMES AND BUSINESSES, LET ME ASSURE YOU, CHANGE IS GOOD. THIS PLAN REPRESENTS THE END OF URBAN DECAY, THE END OF YOUR BROKEN-DOWN SHOPS AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS, THE END OF ANTIQUATED AND DILAPIDATED STOREFRONTS. IT'S TIME FOR A NEW WORLD. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW. WHAT'S WRONG WITH OLD THINGS? SOME OLD THINGS ARE GREAT. YEAH, LIKE MRS. VITELLO. WHIPPERSNAPPER. OW! THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS. THE CITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDED AGAINST IT, BUT THE MAYOR'S LETTIN' HIM DO IT ANYWAY. - I NEVER FIGURED HE COULD PULL IT OFF. IT MEANS THEY WANT US TO SELL OUT AND MOVE AWAY... SO THIS SCHECK CHARACTER AND HIS BIG CORPORATION CAN MOVE IN. NO! NO WAY! - IT'S TIME TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND US. I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT'S FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES. * BUT THIS IS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY CAN'T JUST TEAR IT DOWN. * * THIS IS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD * HOW CAN THEY TEAR IT DOWN * HOW CAN THEY TURN OUR SMILE INTO A FROWN * * IT MAY BE JUST A FEW * BUT IT'S ME AND YOU AND YOU * NO. NO SINGING, EUGENE. * BUT I THOUGHT THE OCCASION CALLED FOR IT. * WE MAY BE JUST A FEW NO. THIS IS SERIOUS. OH, MY-- WE CAN'T TAKE THIS LYING DOWN. - WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING! - WE CAN REFUSE TO SELL OUR HOUSES. - WE'LL ALL SIGN A PETITION. YEAH. LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT UP WITHOUT A FIGHT. HA! ARNOLD. WHAT AN ANNOYING LITTLE GOODY TWO-SHOES. WHAT A DOPEY LITTLE DREAMER. WHAT A CORNY LITTLE CORNBALL. ALWAYS GOING AROUND TRYING TO GET EVERYONE TO LOOK... ON THE BRIGHT SIDE AND DO THE RIGHT THING. HOW I DESPISE HIM. AND YET... I LOVE HIM. I LOVE HIM. I LOVE HIS UNERRING SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG. I LOVE HIS UNFAILING INSISTENCE ON THE NEEDS OF THE MANY OVER THE NEEDS OF THE FEW. BUT, MOST OF ALL, I LOVE THE WAY HIS HAIR SMELLS... WHEN I GET REAL CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND HE DOESN'T KNOW I'M THERE, BUT THEN HE TURNS AND LOOKS AT ME FUNNY. I SCOWL AT HIM AND MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR BEING SO CLOSE. THEN I INSULT HIM JUST TO COVER UP THE SECRET, ADORING FEELINGS... FOR WHICH I HAVE SO LONG AND PAINFULLY HARBORED. OH, ARNOLD! MR. GREEN CAN WRITE THE PETITION. SAY NO MORE, ARNOLD. I'M ALREADY WORKIN' ON IT. IF ONLY I COULD FIND THE GUTS TO TELL YOU. IF ONLY I WEREN'T SUCH A COWARD. IF ONLY I HAD YOUR STRENGTH. WE'LL TAKE IT AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND GET EVERYBODY TO SIGN. WHAT IF YOU LOSE? WHAT IF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS TORN DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO MOVE AWAY, AND WE'RE SEPARATED, AND WE NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, AND I NEVER, EVER SEIZE THE CHANCE TO TELL YOU HOW I REALLY FEEL ABOUT YOU? OH, ARNOLD, HOW I LOVE YOU. DAD! HOW'S IT GOING, MIRIAM? OH, MOLASSES, IT'S YOU. OKAY, GREAT, BUT WHERE DOES THE STORE GO? ALL RIGHT, RIGHT HERE. BIG BOB'S BEEPER EMPORIUM. BIG SIGN, CAN'T MISS IT FROM THE FREEWAY, AND THE OVERPASS DROPS YOU, BING, BANG, BOOM, RIGHT IN THE PARKIN' LOT. THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT IN THE STINKIN' LOT. - IT'S HELGA, DAD. - HELGA. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. - WE GOTTA SPLIT, BOB. WE'LL TALK. RIGHT. WE'LL TALK. AND SEND ME THE PAPERWORK. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED. - YOU GOT IT. GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? IT'S OUR FUTURE. SEE, HERE'S WHERE MY NEW SUPER BEEPER EMPORIUM IS GONNA GO UP, RIGHT AFTER WE RIP DOWN THE FLOWER SHOP AND GREEN MEATS AND THE REST OF THE BLOCK. ABOUT ALL THAT, DAD, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE AWAY AND SELL THEIR BUSINESSES. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? - WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THIS WHOLE... TEAR-DOWN-THE-NEIGHBORHOOD, FUTURE TECH THING IS REALLY NECESSARY. OF COURSE IT'S NECESSARY. IT'S MORE THAN NECESSARY. IT'S PROGRESS. YOU CAN'T HAVE PROGRESS WITHOUT A LITTLE PAIN. NO PAIN, NO GAIN. WHAT'S WRONG WITH LEAVING THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT, MISSY. LEAVE THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE AND BIG BOB'S SUPER BEEPER EMPORIUM DOESN'T HAPPEN. - BUT, DAD-- - HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. I'M GONNA SAY THIS ONCE, AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR IT, LITTLE LADY. CHANGE IS GOOD. WHEN THE NEW BIG BOB'S SUPER BEEPER EMPORIUM GOES UP, THE CASH IS GONNA ROLL IN, AND YOU'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WE'LL BE RICH. AND THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE RICH. YOU CAN HAVE THAT PONY YOU'VE BEEN WANTIN'. DAD, I WANTED A PONY WHEN I WAS FIVE. - I DON'T KNOW. WELL, MAKE UP YOUR MIND, 'CAUSE ONCE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD GOES DOWN... AND MY STORE GOES UP, YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT, AND I MEAN ANYTHING. - THAT'S WHAT I SAID. WE'RE GONNA BE STINKIN' RICH, GIRL. RICH. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT, HUH? [ Squealing, Meowing, Barking ] - THAT'S MY NAME. DON'T WEAR IT OUT. GRANDPA, I'M WORRIED. OH, DON'T WORRY, ARNOLD. WE WON'T SELL THE BOARDING HOUSE. WE'RE BEHIND YOU ALL THE WAY. RIGHT, POOKIE? RAH, RAH, ZIS KOOM BAH! HOME TEAM, HOME TEAM, WOO! BUT, WHAT IF SCHECK GETS EVERYONE ELSE TO SELL? THEN I GUESS THEY'LL BULLDOZE DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SHORT MAN. POOKIE AND I WILL HAVE TO MOVE TO AN OLD FOLKS' HOME, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SENT TO A FOSTER HOME IN SOME MIDWESTERN STATE, LIKE MANITOBA OR-- WAIT. NO, THAT'S NOT A STATE. THAT'S A PROVINCE. OH, NO, ARNOLD! YOU'LL BE A CANADIAN! - GRANDPA, I'M SERIOUS. - I KNOW, ARNOLD, BUT WE'RE NOT COOKED YET. AND WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE'LL ALL BE OKAY, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO BECOME CANADIANS. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE VERY GOOD BACON THERE. CANADIAN. BACON. IS THIS THING ON? COME ON, ARNOLD. WORK WITH ME. GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA. GOOD NIGHT, GRANDMA. GO, TEAM! AWESOME. WOW! RELEASE. - YOU MUST BE A SOUND SLEEPER, ARNOLD. - THEY'VE BEEN HAMMERING ON IT ALL MORNING. - LOOK! WILLIKERS! - IT'S SO WICKED AWESOME. YOU GUYS, IT'S NOT AWESOME. IT'S TERRIBLE. READ IT. WE'VE GOT 30 DAYS LEFT TO SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. LOOK, IT'S THAT SCHECK "FELLER." IT'S TIME FOR A NEW WORLD. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW. I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT'S FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES. HE SURE GIVES ME THE WILLIES. BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT, HE LOOKS GOOD IN A SUIT. GERALD. I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING. COME ON! MONKEYMAN! YEAH, SIX DAYS TO GO, AND THEN SAYONARA, SUCKERS! SIX DAYS. ENOUGH TIME TO TRY MAYBE ONE LAST BIG... THING. BUT WHAT? HOW ABOUT A PARTY? YOU ALWAYS THROW THE MOST OUTRE PARTIES, ARNOLD. YEAH, A PARTY. A BLOCK PARTY. - WITH MUSIC AND FOOD. - AND FINGER SANDWICHES. OOH! - YEAH, AND FOOD! - WE'LL HAVE A CONCERT. THE MUSIC WILL BE SO LOUD THAT WE'D END UP ON THE NEWS. THEN PEOPLE WOULD GET EXCITED ABOUT IT, AND THE MAYOR WILL HAVE TO CHANGE HER MIND. AND SHE'LL STOP THE BULLDOZERS. YEAH! - HOW ABOUT THE SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD DEBUTANTE BALL? NAH. - BLOCK POWER, BABY. - BLOCKENANNY. - BLOCK TILL YOU DROP. OW! IT'S A BLOCK THING. Y'ALL WOULDN'T KNOW. A BLOCK PARTY... PARTY? HOW ABOUT BLOCKAPALOOZA? YEAH! - BLOCKAPALOOZA. - THIS SATURDAY IS THE DAY. BLOCKAPALOOZA! DON'T FORGET TO GET YOUR TICKETS WHILE THEY'RE HOT! "SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD"? "BLOCKAPALOOZA"? THIS WE DON'T NEED. YEAH, IT'S ME, NICK. I THINK WE GOT A PROBLEM. * BLOCKAPALOOZA, HUH! PLEASE. IT'S CALLED BLOCKAPALOOZA, A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE... A FORGOTTEN NEIGHBORHOOD FROM THE WRECKING BALL. A CLASSIC STORY OF THE LITTLE GUY PITTED AGAINST THE CORPORATE GIANT. WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY DOING? THEY'LL MESS UP THE WHOLE DEAL! - FORGET ABOUT IT. IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF. - YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO STAND UP AND TELL FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES THAT WE WON'T SELL. - WE WON'T LET 'EM TEAR DOWN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. ONE OF OUR GUYS INTERCEPTED THEIR PERMIT, THEREBY MAKING THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE ILLEGAL. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE. THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE. - THIS WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE IS ILLEGAL. BUT WE FILED A PERMIT. WE NEVER GOT ANY PERMIT. LEAVE THIS AREA AT ONCE. - BRING ON YOUR WORST. - WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED. - COME ON, LADY. NICE AND EASY. HEY, STOP! THAT'S A FRAIL OLD LADY. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. NEVER GIVE UP, ARNOLD. NEVER GIVE IN. SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. ONE IF BY LAND, TWO IF BY SEA. PUT THE LIME IN THE COCONUT. MIX IT ALL UP. WELL, THAT'S IT. THIS PLACE BELONGS TO SCHECK NOW. THEY'VE EVEN GOT THE COPS ON THEIR SIDE. I GIVE UP. ME TOO. I'M SELLING MY PLACE. GOOD-BYE, OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. SELLING? BUT-- OH, I GUESS I'LL GO TRY AND GET YOUR GRANDMA OUT OF JAIL, SHORT MAN. - THEN WE BETTER GET PACKING. GRANDPA, WE CAN'T GIVE UP. IT'S NOT OVER. OH! THAT SCHECK CHARACTER HAS US COVERED... FROM EVERY ANGLE, SHORT MAN. WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU ALL GOING? COME BACK. COME BACK. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW. I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE. CHANGE IS GOOD. * - ONLY TWO MORE DAYS NOW. - I KNOW. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY WE CAN STOP THE BULLDOZERS. LOOK, ARNOLD, WE TRIED. THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO. WE JUST HAVE TO FACE IT. IN TWO DAYS, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS COMING DOWN, AND WE'RE ALL JUST GONNA HAVE TO MOVE ON. I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING. BABY CARRIAGE, TEN O'CLOCK. I SEE IT. ARNOLD, SAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD ISN'T A GAME. IT'S REAL LIFE, AND IN REAL LIFE YOU CAN'T ALWAYS WIN. I MEAN, I CAN WIN RUNAWAY BUS EVERY TIME I PLAY IT, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A GAME. - I GUESS. - YOU DID YOUR BEST, BUDDY. - HEY, ARNOLD. WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT A PIECE OF HISTORY. IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO STINKY AND ME MADE THESE HANDPRINTS IN THE CEMENT. - YEAH. - SID AND STINK. - IT ONLY SAYS STINK... ON ACCOUNT OF JUST WHEN I WAS FIXING TO WRITE THE "Y" TO FINISH OFF MY NAME, SID'S OLD MAN CAME MOSEYING AROUND THE CORNER, AND WE HAD TO HIGHTAIL IT. - I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MADE IT EVEN COOLER. - YEAH. WE ALWAYS FIGURED IT'D BE THERE FOREVER, BUT AFTER THEY TEAR DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I RECKON NOBODY'LL EVEN REMEMBER. YEAH. - HI, MR. GREEN. - LOOK, ARNOLD, THAT WAS ME, FOUR YEARS OLD. MY GRANDFATHER MADE THE MARK. HE WAS SO PROUD OF ME. HE USED TO TELL ME, "MARTY, ONE DAY, GREEN MEATS IS GONNA BE YOUR SHOP." AND, SURE ENOUGH, MY FATHER TOOK IT OVER, AND THEN, WHEN HE RETIRED, HE PASSED IT ON TO ME. THAT WAS THE PROUDEST DAY OF MY LIFE. I ALWAYS KNEW ONE DAY I'D PASS THE SHOP ON TO MY OWN SON. I GUESS NOW THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. - BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA TEAR DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOOD? - NO. BECAUSE MY SON HATES MEAT. HE'S ONE OF THOSE VEGETARIANS. WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN YEARS. STILL, I NEVER THOUGHT... I'D BE THE LAST GREEN TO RUN GREEN MEATS. ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS, IT'S ALL GONNA BE JUST A PILE OF BRICKS. EXCUSE ME, ARNOLD. [ Squealing, Meowing, Barking ] - SHE'S STILL IN JAIL. - BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST GONNA KEEP HER FOR ONE NIGHT. - SHE KEEPS TRYING TO ESCAPE. THINKS IT'S A GAME. FOURTH TIME THEY HAD TO PUT HER BACK. HI, MR. HYUNH. HAVE YOU SEEN GRANDPA? OH, ARNOLD. WE MAY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. HEY, MR. HYUNH, CAN I HELP YOU CLEAN OUT YOUR "REFRIGETERATOR"? - UH, PACKING YOUR STUFF, SHORT MAN. YOU HAVEN'T SOLD THE HOUSE YET, HAVE YOU? OH, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME NOW, ARNOLD. EVERYONE ELSE HAS SOLD. SCHECK OWNS THE WHOLE BLOCK NOW, EXCEPT FOR US. I HAVE TO SELL. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. ME NEITHER, SHORT MAN. HECK, I WAS BORN IN THIS HOUSE. MY DAD GOT IT IN THE 1890s, OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WON IT IN A CARD GAME FROM A MAN HIS DAD HAD FOUGHT IN THE TOMATO INCIDENT. - OH, YES, THE TOMATO INCIDENT. NOW, THAT WAS A GOOD STORY. THE YANKS WON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS TO THIS LAND AFTER THE PIG WAR. BUT, UNTIL THEN, WE STILL PAID TAXES TO THE BRITISH CROWN... ON ALL SORTS OF GOODS, INCLUDING TOBACCO, MEATS, AND VEGETABLES. THE WHOLE TOWN WAS IN A SNIT OVER A NEW TOMATO TAX. THE BRITS WERE ADDING A NICKEL ON EVERY TOMATO. PEOPLE WERE UP IN ARMS, SPOILING FOR A FIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED? THE TOMATO INCIDENT, ARNOLD. MY GRANDPA AND HIS NEIGHBORS TURNED OVER A CART FULL OF... BRITISH TOMATOES ON THIS VERY STREET. SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO ARREST HIM, BY ORDER OF THE COLONIAL GOVERNOR, ARCHIBALD VON SCHECK. - HMM, I WONDER IF HE'S ANY RELATION. ANYWAY, VON SCHECK'S MEN ATTACKED THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT THE LOCALS USED GUERRILLA WARFARE. THEY MADE A BARRICADE OF UPTURNED VEGETABLE CARTS... AND FOUGHT BACK WITH WHATEVER THEY HAD. AND THEY HAD A LOT OF TOMATOES. THEY WERE BRITISH TOMATOES, WHICH WERE SMALL AND HARD, AND REALLY HURT IF YOU GOT HIT WITH ONE. LET 'ER RIP. THAT DID IT. THE REDCOATS WERE IN FULL, IGNOMINIOUS RETREAT. - AND THAT'S WHY WE EAT AMERICAN TOMATOES, ARNOLD. ALTHOUGH, I HAD ONE THE OTHER DAY THAT CAME FROM CHILE. VERY JUICY. - GRANDPA, DID THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN? - OF COURSE IT HAPPENED. I SLICED IT UP AND PUT IT IN A SANDWICH. NO, DON'T YOU SEE? THIS IS OUR ANSWER. YES! YES, ARNOLD! JUICY TOMATOES FROM CHILE. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? NO, THE TOMATO INCIDENT. IF THAT BATTLE TOOK PLACE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BOARDING HOUSE, THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD SHOULD BE A NATIONAL LANDMARK. WELL, THERE PROBABLY WAS A DOCUMENT THAT DECLARED THIS BLOCK A HISTORIC SITE ONCE. THEN MAYBE I CAN FIND IT. WE'VE STILL GOT TWO DAYS. I CAN SHOW THE DOCUMENT TO THE MAYOR, AND SHE'D STOP THE BULLDOZERS. THEY COULDN'T TEAR DOWN THESE BUILDINGS... EVER! AND MR. GREEN AND MRS. VITELLO COULD KEEP THEIR SHOPS. AND SID AND STINKY'S HANDPRINTS WOULD ALWAYS STAY IN THE SIDEWALK. AND YOU AND GRANDMA AND ME AND ALL THE BOARDERS COULD KEEP LIVING JUST LIKE BEFORE. NOTHING WOULD CHANGE. GRANDPA, DON'T SELL THE BOARDING HOUSE. I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN THAT DOCUMENT AND SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOU'RE A BOLD KID, ARNOLD. I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY. BUT YOU BETTER HURRY BEFORE THE BULLDOZERS KNOCK DOWN THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE. CHANGE IS GOOD. I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND THE FUTURE IS F.T.I. SO, MY SUPER BEEPER EMPORIUM'S GOING HERE, WHERE WE'RE KNOCKING DOWN THESE OLD SHOPS, RIGHT? - THAT'S RIGHT, BOB. ABSOLUTELY. - AND THERE'S NO FUNNY BUSINESS IN IT, RIGHT? IT'S ALL ON THE UP-AND-UP. TRUST ME. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SIGN. BIG... BOB... PA... TAK... I! BEAUTIFUL, BOB. IT'S ALL SETTLED. TWO DAYS FROM NOW, MY BULLDOZERS ARE GONNA... TEAR DOWN THE OLD AND MAKE WAY FOR THE NEW. AND THEN ALL WE GOTTA DO IS SIT BACK... AND WATCH THE MOOLA ROLL IN. EH - YOU'VE GOT A WAY WITH WORDS, BOB. OH, ARNOLD, ANOTHER MORAL DILEMMA. STICK WITH BIG BOB AND GET RICH, OR DARE TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY TO HELP YOU, MY BELOVED, NOBLE ARNOLD, FOR WHOM SO I HAVE SO LONG ADORED. OH, IF ONLY I KNEW WHAT TO DO. IF ONLY I HAD SOME KIND OF SIGN. OH! PERFECT. OKAY, ARNOLD, YOU CONVINCED ME. RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA FIND THAT DOCUMENT, DELIVER IT TO THE MAYOR, PROVE THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS A LEGAL NATIONAL LANDMARK, AND STOP THE BULLDOZERS FROM KNOCKING IT DOWN. RIGHT. AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT ALL IN THE NEXT... 46 HOURS AND 19 MINUTES. RIGHT. SHOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME. OOF! ARNOLD! I-- I MEAN, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, FOOTBALL HEAD. WHERE'S THE FIRE? SORRY, HELGA. WE'RE JUST IN A HURRY. WE'VE GOTTA FIND A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT THAT CAN SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YEAH, RIGHT! IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU'RE EVEN DOPIER THAN I THOUGHT. ALL THE PAPERS ARE SIGNED. THE INK'S DRY. AND IN TWO DAYS THE BULLDOZERS ARE GONNA ROLL, AND THIS WHOLE PLACE IS GONNA BE A PARKING LOT. END OF STORY. ANY QUESTIONS? UH, YEAH. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD LEND US BUS FARE? WE'RE A LITTLE SHORT, HELGA. IT'S LIKE I'M LIVING IN LOSER CITY. OH, WELL, SINCE MY DAD'S NEW SUPER BEEPER EMPORIUM IS GONNA BE BUILT ON... THE ASHES OF YOUR OLD LIVES, AND I'M GONNA GET RICH OFF THE WHOLE DEAL, I GUESS THE LEAST I CAN DO IS GIVE YOU CHANGE FOR THE BUS. THANKS. THANKS. GOOD LUCK. YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT, LOSERS. THERE'S ONE THING YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME. WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO THE ONE PERSON THAT CAN HELP US FIND THAT DOCUMENT, MR. BAILEY. YOU MEAN THAT GUY AT THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF INFORMATION? RIGHT. I KNOW HE CAN HELP US. I CAN'T HELP YOU. C-A-N, APOSTROPHE, "T." "CAN'T." BUT, MR. BAILEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT. I'M SURE IT IS, BUT SO IS MY JOB. LOOK AT ALL THIS WORK I GOT PILED UP. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN A CHECK ON SOME... TOMATO DOCUMENT THAT WAS PROBABLY LOST 50 YEARS AGO. NOW, PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT IN HERE ANYWAY. BUT, MR. BAILEY, IF WE DON'T FIND THAT DOCUMENT, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE TORN DOWN. MR. GREEN'S BUTCHER SHOP, MRS. VITELLO'S FLOWER SHOP. THE VIDEO STORE, THE ARCADE. LOOK, HOW MANY WAYS DO I GOTTA SAY IT? I CAN'T HELP YOU. - BOWLING ALLEY. SLAUSEN'S ICE CREAM. - PLEASE-- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY PATIENCE WITH YOU. DOLLY'S DONUTS. DOLLY'S DONUTS? YEAH. YOU KNOW, THAT GREAT DONUT SHOP, DOLLY'S DONUTS. - OH, WE WERE JUST SAYING WHAT A SHAME IT IS THAT... THE BULLDOZERS ARE GONNA TEAR DOWN DOLLY'S DONUTS. YEAH. UH, DOLLY'S DONUTS. TWO DAYS FROM NOW, THEY'RE HISTORY. NO MORE DOLLY'S DONUTS, MR. BAILEY. BUT, I LOVE THOSE DONUTS. NOBODY MAKES A CRULLER LIKE DOLLY. I'VE BEEN GOING TO DOLLY'S EVERY DAY FOR 30 YEARS. I DON'T THINK I COULD GET THROUGH A MORNING WITHOUT 'EM. HOW CAN THEY TEAR DOWN AN INSTITUTION LIKE DOLLY'S? THAT'S JUST... SAVAGE. I KNOW. BUT, HEY, WHAT CAN YOU DO? RIGHT. UH, SEE YOU, MR. BAILEY. WAIT A MINUTE. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YA? WELL, COME ON, THEN. WE'VE GOT A DOCUMENT TO FIND. THIS IS IT. AS SOON AS THE COMPUTER STOPS, IT'LL SPIT OUT A CARD, WHICH WILL TELL US EVERYTHING THE SYSTEM KNOWS ABOUT WHERE... YOUR TOMATO DOCUMENT IS. "THE LOCATION OF YOUR DOCUMENT IS... UNKNOWN." I'M SORRY, BOYS. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MR. BAILEY. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. YOU DID YOUR BEST. WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? BOYS, IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH MENTIONING, BUT I KNOW A GUY. THE CITY CORONER. HE'S KIND OF, UH, WELL, A NUT. BUT HE'S A WELL-KNOWN HISTORY BUFF, AND HE KEEPS ALL KINDS OF CRAZY RECORDS... ON OLD HISTORICAL PAPERS. MAYBE HE COULD HELP YOU FIND THAT DOCUMENT. YOU KNOW, ARNOLD, THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE CLOSED. LET'S COME BACK LATER. WE DON'T HAVE TIME, GERALD. COME ON. Y-YOU FIRST. HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? HELLO! I WAS JUST... TAKING A NAP. DID I SCARE YOU? I SCARE MOST PEOPLE. NOT INTENTIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND. JUST THE NATURE OF THE JOB. ANYHOO! WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? THE TOMATO INCIDENT OF WHICH YOU SPEAK DID INDEED HAPPEN. IN FACT, IT WAS A MAJOR... HISTORICAL TURNING POINT IN THE BIRTH OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT ABOUT THE DOCUMENT? WELL! THERE WAS, AS I RECALL, A DOCUMENT, STATING THAT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD... WAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED A NATIONAL LANDMARK. NOT AN ESPECIALLY WELL-KNOWN DOCUMENT, BUT OFFICIAL NONETHELESS. AND I JUST MAY HAVE A FILE ON IT. I KEEP MY HISTORICAL RECORDS IN HERE. WHOOPS, WRONG DRAWER. - AHA! HERE WE GO. TOMATO INCIDENT, TOMATO INCIDENT, TO-MAH-TO INCIDENT, TOMATO, TO-MAH-TO, TOMATO. TOMATO INCIDENT! HERE IT IS. ACCORDING TO MY RECORDS, THERE WAS A DOCUMENT DETAILING THE OFFICIAL STATUS OF... YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AS A NATIONAL LANDMARK. - LET'S SEE. IT WAS CONTAINED IN A COLLECTION OF LOCAL HISTORICAL PAPERS, WHICH WERE SOLD AT AUCTION... FIVE YEARS AGO TO A PRIVATE CORPORATION. THERE'S NO RECORD OF A NAME, BUT THERE IS AN ADDRESS. SIX, SIX, SIX, ONE, THREE, RIVERSIDE HIGHWAY. IT'S OUT ON THE PENINSULA. YOU'RE GOING OUT TO THE PENINSULA, RIGHT? DON'T TALK TO THE DRIVER WHILE THE BUS IS IN MOTION. BUT THE BUS ISN'T IN MOTION. NOW IT IS. GET BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. 66590, 66600. WE'RE CLOSE, GERALD. FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES. FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES? THEY'VE GOT THE DOCUMENT? OOH, OOH, OOH. THE DOCUMENT THAT COULD SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD... IS IN THE HANDS OF FUTURE TECH? NOW WHAT, ARNOLD? I GUESS WE GO AND TALK TO MR. SCHECK. YOU CAN'T TALK TO MR. SCHECK. BUT-- HE CAN'T BE SEEN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. -THEN WE'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. -MR. SCHECK DOESN'T MAKE APPOINTMENTS. ALL RIGHTY, THEN, YOU HAVE A NICE DAY. RIGHT. GOOD-BYE. GERALD, THERE'S CAMERAS EVERYWHERE. AND I THINK THEY'RE WATCHING US. MAN, THIS IS CREEPY. LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE. SECURITY. YES, MR. SCHECK? THERE ARE TWO YOUNG BOYS IN THE HALLWAY, 40 FEET FROM YOUR SECURITY DESK. WHAT? SIR, I, UH, UH-- APPREHEND THEM. AND BRING THEM TO MY OFFICE. * LIFE IS JUST A BOWL OF CHERRIES * SIR, WE FOUND THESE BOYS WANDERING THE HALLS UNESCORTED. UNESCORTED? WITHOUT SECURITY CLEARANCE? YES, SIR. THAT'S RIGHT SIR. THIS IS SERIOUS, ISN'T IT? YES, SIR. WE CAN'T HAVE YOUNG BOYS WANDERING... THE HALLS OF FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES UNESCORTED... WITHOUT SECURITY CLEARANCE, NOW, CAN WE? NO, SIR. NO, SIR. NO, SIR. AND THESE SMALL BOYS JUST SNUCK PAST SECURITY AND WANDERED ABOUT THE BUILDING UNESCORTED. IS THAT ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT? YES, SIR. - "YES, SIR." WELL, NOW, WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT? - YOU'RE THE HEAD OF SECURITY, AREN'T YOU? - SIR, YES, SIR. "SIR, SIR. YES, SIR. SIR." IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY? NO, SIR. I MEAN, YES, SIR. SIR! THERE HE GOES AGAIN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO NOW. GO BACK TO YOUR DUTIES AS HEAD OF SECURITY. WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER BOYS ARE OUT THERE, WANDERING THE HALLS... OF FUTURE TECH INDUSTRIES UNESCORTED WHILE YOU STAND HERE LIKE A BIG, DUMB STIFF! REPEATING, "SIR, YES, SIR, SIR." YES, SIR. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH A CHARACTER LIKE THAT? HE'S LIKE A WINDUP DOLL. "YES, SIR. SIR, YES, SIR. SIR, SIR." I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S HARD TO GET GOOD HELP NOWADAYS. IT MUST BE UPSETTING TO BE APPREHENDED AND DRAGGED, UNCEREMONIOUSLY, INTO MY OFFICE LIKE THIS, BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOUNG BOYS WANDERING THE HALLS... OF MY COMPANY UNESCORTED, YOU UNDERSTAND, HM? MY NAME IS SCHECK. AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE? I'M ARNOLD, AND THIS IS MY FRIEND, GERALD. - WE LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU WANT TO TEAR DOWN. - THAT I'M GOING TO TEAR DOWN. WE HEARD THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT THAT SAYS THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD IS... A NATIONAL LANDMARK AND CAN NEVER BE TORN DOWN BY ANYBODY. REALLY? I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT TOO. IN FACT, I HAD MY PEOPLE LOOK INTO IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY FOUND? THE DOCUMENT DOESN'T EXIST. THE WHOLE THING'S JUST A RUMOR, BOGUS. I PROMISE YOU, IF THERE WERE SUCH A DOCUMENT, I WOULD NEVER GO THROUGH WITH MY PLAN. BUT THE DOCUMENT MUST EXIST. IT WAS PART OF A COLLECTION OF LOCAL HISTORICAL PAPERS. LOOK, MY YOUNG FRIEND, AS MUCH AS I ADMIRE YOUR THOROUGHNESS... AND DIRECT APPROACH, THE FACT REMAINS: I DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENT. SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS COMING DOWN. ANY QUESTIONS? WHAT IF WE WERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T BUY YOUR STORY? HM. SECURITY. THAT WENT WELL. THAT SCHECK IS NOT A GOOD MAN. BUT HE'S A NATTY-DADDY DRESSER. YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG? NICK, I JUST HAD AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH TWO YOUNG BOYS. ONE HAD A WEIRD STACK OF HAIR, AND THE OTHER WAS A FOOTBALL-HEADED KID. A FOOTBALL-HEADED KID, HUH. HEY, BOB, YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A FOOTBALL NAH. - I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT NO FOOTBALL-HEADED KID, BOSS. ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE NOSING AROUND HERE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, ASKING ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT. YOU KNOW THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU MEAN THE DOCUMENT THAT COULD MESS UP OUR WHOLE OPERATION? BUT IT'S LOCKED IN THE RECORDS ROOM. NOBODY HAS A KEY FOR IT, EXCEPT YOU AND ME. I PROMISE YOU, MR. SCHECK, I HAVEN'T SEEN A KID LIKE THAT. BUT I WILL DEFINITELY KEEP MY EYES OPEN. I'M NOT READY TO GIVE UP YET. ARNOLD, SOONER OR LATER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE THE FACTS. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT SCHECK'S PLAN. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING. ARNOLD, IT WOULD TAKE SOME KIND OF MIRACLE. HELLO? THE DOCUMENT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EXISTS. THEY'RE HIDING IT FROM YOU. WHAT - CALL ME DEEP VOICE. I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT SCHECK IS UP TO NO GOOD. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP HIM IS THE DOCUMENT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DOCUMENT? LET'S JUST SAY... I KNOW. WHERE IS THE DOCUMENT? IT'S HIDDEN AT F.T.I. IN A LOCKED SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. - NICK VERMICELLI HAS THE KEY. BUT HOW DO WE... FOLLOW NICK, AND YOU'LL FIND THE KEY. I'LL BE IN TOUCH. BUT WAIT! WHO ARE YOU? THAT IS TOO FREAKY. I'M SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU. I'M IN, MAN. WHAT'S THE PLAN? THE PLAN IS WE FIND NICK VERMICELLI. RIGHT. THEN WE SPY ON HIM, FOLLOWING HIM EVERYWHERE UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHERE HE'S HIDING THE KEY TO THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. RIGHT. THEN, WE STEAL THE KEY, GO TO F.T.I., SNEAK IN AND... GET THE DOCUMENT OUT OF THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. - RIGHT. - WE EVADE THE SECURITY GUARDS, AND IF WE MAKE IT THAT FAR, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HEAD UPTOWN, FIND THE MAYOR, AND DELIVER THE DOCUMENT SO SHE CAN DECLARE THE NEIGHBORHOOD... A NATIONAL LANDMARK AND STOP THE BULLDOZERS. ARNOLD, THAT'S A LONG PLAN. I KNOW. BUT WE GOTTA DO IT IF WE'RE GONNA SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME SPECIAL EQUIPMENT. THIS MAY SOUND KIND OF CRAZY, BUT I'VE HEARD OF THIS GIRL, BRIDGET, WHO LIVES ACROSS TOWN, KIND OF A, UH, EQUIPMENT SPECIALIST. ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE? IT'S THE ADDRESS FUZZY SLIPPERY GAVE ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE'LL HELP US? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BRIDGET DOES, ARNOLD. SHE HELPS PEOPLE. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW THE LEGEND GOES. - MAYBE SHE'S NOT HOME. - I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD TOUCH THAT. - WHOA! OKAY, WHICH ONE OF YOU TOUCHED MY BUTTON? ME. ME. IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY AND SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME EQUIPMENT. TOP OF THE LINE, STATE OF THE ART. MINI-CONDENSER AND MICROPHONE... FOR THE ULTIMATE CONCEALED SURVEILLANCE. HEADPHONES AND MICRO-RADAR TRACKING DISH. FOUR-HUNDRED-TO-ONE ZOOM LENS BINOCULARS WITH INFRARED CAPABILITY FOR NIGHT VISION. HIGH TENSION, PLASTIC WIRE, ANODIZED STEEL PULLEYS AND NYLON STRAPS... FOR MANEUVERING IN VERTICALLY-CHALLENGING SITUATIONS. A TWO-WAY SECURE WALKIE-TALKIE FOR MAINTAINING COMMUNICATION. AND A SYNCHRONIZED, PROGRAMMABLE, GLOW-IN-THE-DARK WATCH, SET TO GREENWICH TIME. AND ACCURATE WITHIN 1/10,000th OF A SECOND. AND IT ALL FITS INTO THIS REALLY COOL AS-47 JUNIOR SECRET AGENT UTILITY BELT. UH-HUH. HOW MUCH DOES ALL THIS COST? WELL, SINCE IT'S FOR SUCH A GOOD CAUSE, IT'S ON THE HOUSE. - I FIGURE IT'S MY CONTRIBUTION. - GREAT.
