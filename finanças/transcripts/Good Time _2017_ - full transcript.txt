Okay, Nick, we're getting close to the end. But we're moving into a new section now, what they call sentence interpretation. Do you understand that? You know what those interpreting a sentence means? No. It's just a fancy word for telling what the words mean to you. - Okay. - Okay. And what these are, these are common expressions that people sometimes say. You might hear it out on the street, you might've seen it on TV, uh, maybe a friend, maybe your grandmother. So, I'm going to read you a few of those, okay? - Okay. - All right. Uh, the first one is, "Don't count your chickens before they hatch." What does that mean to you, that expression? "Don't count your chickens before they hatch?" Don't count your chickens. Okay. What are you writing down? Well, the reason I'm asking you the questions is because I'm supposed to write... You know, write down the answers... Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Why are you writing that down? So, in case I forget it later. But I don't like people talking about me after I go places. I don't blame you. I'm not... And I'm not talking about you. This is just for me. These are my own notes. No one sees them but me. I don't like it, but... All right, here's another one. "It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease." What does that expression mean to you? You ever heard that before? Nick? Okay, Nick, you know what? Why don't we skip this section and just move on to the next one? It's actually more fun. It's easier. It's called word comparisons. It's two words that don't appear to be connected, and then you say what you think when you hear the two words together. Okay? Okay. All right. First one is cat and mouse. What does that make you think? They don't like each other. That's right. They're kind of enemies against each other, right? That's what I said. Okay, um... How about scissors and a cooking pan? You can hurt yourself with both. Okay. How about salt and water? The beach. The beach. That's a good answer. Um... Do you mind, could we go back to the scissors and the cooking pan? Um... When you said you can hurt yourself, what were you... What did you mean? Do you ever think about hurting yourself? Why did you think of being hurt? Because I touched the pan, and I hurt my hand. Oh, well, that makes perfect sense. What happened? Do you remember when it was? Do you not want to talk about this? I was sitting there and trying to eat. And she started yelling at me, and pushing me, and just telling me I can't eat food. That was your grandmother who was saying that? Yeah, and then she threw stuff at me. - She threw things at you? - Yeah. Then I picked up the pan, and I threw it at her. You threw it at your grandmother? I threw it at the wall. Oh, you weren't trying to hit your grandmother? Did you burn yourself when you threw the pan? Nick? Nick, it's good that we should talk about this. This is good stuff we're talking about. - Excuse me. - Are you Peter? Yes, I am. We're in the middle of a session. Hello? Nick, what are you doing? We're in the middle of something here. - The middle of an exam. - Come on, get up! - Hey, Nick, Nick... - He's asking me about the stuff, the pan, - and the chicken. - Wait, please! How would you like it if I made you cry, huh? - Would you like that? - No, I would not. But... They told me I had to do this. Get up. Let's go. Let's go! But he wrote... He has all my stuff! Rip that shit up then! This is my work. This is my stuff, okay? Oh, shame on you, Connie. - Shame on me? Shame on you. - You're not helping. Shame on you! - Come on. - Janice, please, could you send Mark and Matthew right away? Is that what you think you are? What? Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. It's just that Grandma said that... I don't wanna hear about Grandma anymore, all right? Fuck Grandma, Nicky. It's just you and me. I'm your friend, all right? I love you, all right? Stop it. Stop it. Stop messing with it. Next? What are you thinking about? Nothing. It's almost over. Stay calm. No, no. No running. Hey. - The mask. - What about it? The mask. I want to take it off. - Huh? - I want to take off the mask. We'll take it off in two minutes. Two minutes. It's all finished now, and everything's great. Nick! Nick! - Where? - Down this alley. Start taking your shit off. It's not coming off. It's not coming off. Connie, help! Help! I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Remember how we did it? Fingers under the flap and pull up. Push it up. Push it up! Push it up, push it up! Push it up! You were fucking incredible. You were incredible. Do you understand? - Yeah. - I'm serious. You think I could have done it without you standing next to me, being strong? No. You feel it, Nicks? Are you feeling as good as I'm feeling right now? - Yeah, I'm cold. - You're cold? - Yeah. - Hey, fuck it. - Let's get to Virginia, man. - All right. What the fuck? Nick! Nick! Come here. Stay with me. Where'd he go? Where are you? Is he at the bank? You circling around? I'm on the corner. I'm on the corner where you dropped me off. You gotta get back here right now. I'm outside the Mango Rico. Yes, yes, yes, yes. He's here? - Get in the car. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. The cops, they moved me here. - Don't want me there. - Don't worry about it. Let's go. Are we still going to the Port Authority? Yes, nothing's changed, exact same place. You wanna hold it? Yeah. I don't care. What was that sound? What the fuck did you do? My face. My face. My face, my face. My face is burning. - My face is burning. - Your face isn't burning. - My face is burning. - Hey, look at me, look at me. - Connie, my face is burning. - Look at me. Your face isn't burning. You'll be all right. Look, look, look. My face. - My face, Connie. My... - Just breathe, just breathe. - We going for a walk? - No, no. I think I'm gonna throw up. You're not going to fucking throw up. Come on. I'm gonna throw up. No. What did I just tell you? I don't know. I told you you're not going to throw up, so you're not going to throw up, all right? You're not. Count to 30. One, two, three, four... Keep counting! It's an emergency. I gotta use the bathroom. Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no. Bathrooms are for customers only. Hey, customers only. Hey. Yes, I'm gonna get something. Just give me five minutes. No, no. Open up now! Just wash that shit off your face already. Nick, what the fuck are you doing? Get in the sink. Jesus Christ. - Put your hands up. - Come out! - Take it off. - Yeah. In five seconds, I'll call the police! Get off anything with red or pink dye, okay? My brother is mentally handicapped. A bucket of paint fell off a construction truck and hit him on the head. I'm gonna come out in one second. It's an emergency, all right? Please, just give me five minutes. - It burns, it burns. - Stop, stop it. The pants got dye all over them. Got to get them off. I like these pants. I don't care if you like them. Gotta get them off right now. You got sweatpants underneath. That's why you wore them. Hurry up. Lace them up. Look for anything... - Yes, yes, yes, please. - Come out now! Just keep your head down. Gonna pull back up on us. Just don't say anything, all right? - Okay. - Don't look at them. Don't be scared. - All right. - Let me do all the talking. Hey fellas, where we going? Can I talk to you for a minute? First of all, could you take your hoodie off for me? Why? What did we do wrong? Hey. You with the black sweatshirt. Yo, my man, turn around! He's all right. We didn't do anything wrong. Yo, oh, oh! Get back here! NYPD. Stop! Nick, let's go! Nick! Connie! Stop! Stop! You're under... NYPD. You are not getting up. Sir, I need you to get up! Thanks for the welcome. Yo, CO! Let me talk to the fucking captain, man. I've been here for four days! - Get off the bars! - Fuck! Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Get the captain. Stop fighting. Stop fighting or chemical weapons will be utilized. Stop fighting. The judge is gonna ask her about Connie. And if she says to the judge, "I can't talk about that." He's gonna say, "Then go away, I'm not going to help Nick." She needs to keep the judge happy, answer his questions. She can't do that unless you answer - her questions first. - I don't like to. I don't want to. The point is, it doesn't matter what you tell me. It doesn't matter what you say. It doesn't matter what we do in this time together. Nothing that you and I do here is going to get your brother in trouble. Then why do you keep asking about him? Because, you know what? The thing is, is that I don't think you're as responsible for this as you believe that you are. That money was for us. And he was going to buy me a farm, and we were gonna live in the woods. And I was going to be able to do whatever I wanted, when I wanted, okay? You don't love me, okay? He loves me. Connie loves me! Talking all day on the phone over here, man. You don't know what love is! Yo, son, can you please hurry up? I don't want to talk to you no more! Okay? That was for us. - Hey, yo... - He did it for us. I'm talking to my grandmother, okay? 16,480. You need another ten grand. You can't do anything with this? This stuff is dirty. It's nasty. You can't clean it? You can't do nothing with it? Nah, nah, nah. Come on. It's all garbage. You get another ten grand, I'll get the judge to sign the order. And that's it. I'll have the order waiting for you. Your brother will get out. Go get the ten grand. We're gonna watch Empire. What the fuck are you doing? I was watching this channel. You can't do that. I was watching something in it before. You do not rock on this TV, man. Hey, yo, man. If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with the TV. - Just leave it alone. - Don't talk to me, all right. I don't like you, all right? - Don't talk to me. - You got that green... Nobody was in here before. I'm allowed to watch whatever I want. Yo, my man. Don't touch that TV! Man, this is some... What the fuck is you doing, man? Give me that! Are you not entertained, huh? Not entertained? I told you I was gonna get you, you bitch motherfucker! - I got it! - No, no, I'm here. - Who is it? - It's Connie. Con... No, no, no, no. Ma... Mama, I called him down. Wait a minute. How'd you get in the building? - I invited him up. - They didn't call up. The doorman recognized me. He's not coming in here. Yes, he is. Well, I can just come back later, Loren. Hey. Connie, we're having dinner. And I think - if you could just... - I... I can leave. No, no, no. - Go to my room. - This is a very bad time for us. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? How rude! I'd never treat one of your friends this way. - Look at you! - What? I'm begging you to shut your mouth! - Shut my mouth? - Please, please... Would you just please go look at yourself in the mirror? Just look at yourself. This morning you were fine. What are you talking about? I'm fine right now. This is your problem. Would you just do me a favor? - You know what? - What? Call Dr. Klienman. Why don't you call him? I have a friend over. Mom, I want to stop this conversation. - Yes, yes. - I am stopping it! - Yes. - I'm zipping it! And I'm gonna go visit with my friend. - Yes. - You get a hold of yourself! - Do that. - Fucking freak! Puerto Vallarta. They have the best, best hotels. I love it there. There's a Grand Miramar resort and spa. You can drink right in the pool. It's like they have a whole bar. Ah, fuck. The flight's too long. It's like eight hours. Okay, that's all right. What about Florida? Or hey, hey, hey. Can you just put it down for a second? Costa Rica. Just put it down for a second. I gotta come clean with you about something. What? So, I told you about my brother, yeah? Yeah. I told you about the program he's forced to attend and how he shouldn't be there. Yeah. And how everybody involved with it doesn't know what the fuck they're doing, and he fucking hates it. Hey, Costa Rica's only four and a half hours... Please, could you just put it down for two seconds. Just listen to what I'm saying. Look, something happened, I don't know exactly what. But one of the therapists was abusing him, and I guess he must have lashed out violently, and he really hurt the guy. Now this guy's gonna press charges. My brother's been arrested. He's being held at Riker's Island. Oh, my God, that's awful. I know. You have no idea. I've just gotta get him out of there before something bad happens. See, he could get killed in there. I'm just a little short on the bail money right now. How short? It's like a few thousand. Okay. That's not bad. That's why I was just hoping your mom's credit card could cover the rest of it. Oh. Um... Look, it's just to get him out of Riker's. It's like a temporary loan. You get it right back. Any judge is gonna dismiss this as soon as he gets to court. Yeah. Okay? What, and our trip? We'll go after? Seriously, that's your response to what I just told you? That's your response? Um, I mean, I'm thinking about your brother, too. Yo! We gotta make a different stop. It's still Queens. It's, uh... 82nd and Queens Boulevard. It's near the Union Turnpike. Eric, he's coming. What'd I tell ya? Couple of hours, right? Yeah. You got the full ten? 10,000? - $10,000. - Yeah. - You do credit, right? - Yeah. Yeah. Wait. $10,000? Yeah. You said it was like a couple thousand dollars. It's a loan. You get it back the same time as the three. What's the difference? It's like $7,000 difference, you know. It's for my brother. You're gonna get it back the same day. Right? Right? Yeah, yeah, she'll get it back. You'll get it back. Are we cool? - It's for my brother. - Yeah, I know, I know. It's fine. It's fine. Hey, can you put it through right now? I want to get him out tonight. Tonight? It's 8:35. Judges go to dinner at 9:00. So what? What's the problem? Can you not make a call? They go to dinner. It's only 20 minutes to do the bond, - prepare the paperwork. - You got 20 minutes. Can't you at least see what's possible? - She's paying already. - I got you. You're being pushy. Thank you. Hi, Bobby, how are you? Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry. I just have a client that walked in. Wanted me to post a bond now. Yeah, can you just check, please? Last name N-I-K-A-S. Nikolas. You think the judge will wait? Come on, just ask. We good? It's pretty late for this. Sorry, it's taking longer. The new system... I know. Those chips are such a... They're the bane of my existence. Ah... Hold on. He's not on... He's not on the calendar for tonight. What's the calendar? Where is he? Do you see anything there, any notations? He's at Elmhurst. Lovely. Elmhurst. Elmhurst, the hospital? Yeah, like where sick people go. What's... What's wrong with him? They're not gonna tell ya. It's privileged information. Does this mean we're not going? He's not going to be arraigned in court because they've got him in the hospital. Can we still go away? So until he gets a medical clearance, they're not going to put him on the calendar. When's that going to be? Bobby, give me a second. Just bear with me. When did he get put in the hospital? The card is declined. I think maybe you're punching it in wrong, or something? 'Cause I just used it. What the fuck is wrong with your card? I have no idea. You can call the bank if you want. I do want to call them. I will dial for you, and you do it. Hold on, Bobby. What do you want to do? Can you not call someone? Give me a second. I'm going to call Corrections. I'll see what I can find out. I'm going to punch the numbers, and then... Fuck! It's my mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi, Mom. Did you, um, cancel the card? Did you... Do you want to talk to them? Mom! Sorry, sorry. - Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Calm down. No, no, no, of course, of course. Mom, Mom, Mom, please listen to me. I'm at a legitimate... It's a bail bonds place. So the thing is this. The thing is... - Mom, Mom, Mom. - Hold on. - We get the money back! Mom. - I'll call you back, Bobby. Chaos. Hold on a second. Can you take that outside? Sorry. Excuse me, sir. It's a legitimate loan. Okay. We've got ten minutes, decide. What do you want to do? Look. It's a fucking disaster. I didn't know she was going to be like this. I don't like people yelling in my office. I understand, I understand. Just let me get back the money from earlier, and I'll come back with the rest in full. The money in my safe? No, that stays in the safe. You want to get your brother out? You bring me the other ten grand. That's how it works. Come on, man. Just give me a break, please. I'm giving you a break. That money stays in the safe. That's mine. You get the other ten, I'll get your brother out. You are so good. Please, this isn't your fault. I just wanted to do a good thing for somebody. Hey, man, what's with all the cops? What do you mean? There's cops everywhere. Cops outside my dad's room. All right, what floor is he on? Five. There's not supposed to be any prisoners on five. They're supposed to be on six. Supposed to be on six? That's unacceptable. Excuse me. Where's the nearest bathroom? Down the hall, to the left. Thank you. Hey. Something just scared the shit out of me, man. What? I was sleeping with my dad down the hall. Who's dying, so I'm already half freaked out already. And, uh, all the TV channels started changing on their own. When I get up, it stops. When I sit back down, they all start changing again. So I... What the fuck is that? I don't know what to tell you, man. Fuck, man. I'm think I'm losing my mind. I've been here 48 hours straight. Want something from the vending machine? Nah, I'm good. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Going down to vending to get some coffee. You want some? Yeah, get me a coffee. I'll see you in a sec. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you mind if I put my brother on first? It's so cold, and he doesn't have a jacket or anything. - Is that all right? - You don't mind? All right. Thank you so much. God bless you. Turn him to the side. There you go. All right. Thank you.

We're fine. - Oh, my God. - You gotta change this. I don't want to see them justify this shit. She's fine. There's nothing we can do for that. Just leave the knife right there. Oh, look at the doggy! ...say he was caught breeding pit bulls for dog fighting inside his home. That is messed up. I really love dogs. One of my cousin's friends, Tiara, she has this dog. His name is Blade. He's a Great Dane. Oh, my gosh! I think I was a dog in a previous life. In fact, I know I was. It's why they love me so much. You're watching Time Warner Cable News. New York 1. Now an update on last week's bank robbery in Flushing. Authorities are still searching for. Constantine Nikas, suspected of carrying out the robbery along with his brother. Nikolas Nikas was arrested near the scene after crashing through a plate-glass window at the New World Mall. Today the brothers' grandmother is speaking out in an exclusive interview with NY1's Tara Lynn Wagner. She joins us now from Flushing with the details. Well, that's right, Lewis. In a New York 1 exclusive, Agapia Nikas describes her complicated relationship with her grandsons. She took out a restraining order against Constantine earlier this year, after she says he threatened and stalked her. And she blames him for an altercation with Nikolas that left her with a broken arm. I don't want to call him. I don't want to talk with him. I don't want to, uh... All because he treats his brother so badly. What the fuck? Where the fuck am I? Yo, where you going? Fuck. Yo, where the fuck am I, man? Did you do this to my fucking face? Shut the fuck up. Lower your voice. No. Back the fuck up, man. Back the fuck up. - Listen! Stop it! - Get the fuck off me! - Shut up! Shut up! - Ow! Ow, my fucking arm! Ow!

Close the door! - Fuck! - I swear to God, if you wake up the grandmother, - I'll fuck you up! - Yeah, yeah. I heard you, bro. - God damn it. - Are you gonna stay calm? Yeah, yeah, I'm calm. Fuck. Christ, man. What the fuck is going on? Why am I in handcuffs? You were handcuffed to a stretcher in a hospital. I broke the wrong guy out. - That's all I know. - Hospital? Yeah. There was a cop outside your room. - What? - I fucked up. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you. There was a cop outside your room and you're the wrong guy. Well, what the fuck am I going to do? You can do whatever the fuck you want to do. What you can't do is fuck my shit up. Acting stupid and getting me thrown out. Okay? All right, well listen. Get me a phone, man. I gotta make some phone calls. I don't have a fucking phone. Well, go get one from that fucking girl then. All right. We need to go back to the hospital. Is your brother okay? That's not my brother. The hospital fucked up. Who is that upstairs? I don't know who it is. The hospital fucked up. It's not my fault. Does the car - in the driveway work? - Yeah. Do you know where the keys are? No. Well, where could they be? Can we just go and look for them quickly? Hurry up, get some shit on and go find the keys. Fuck, man. Don't be confused. It's just gonna make it worse for me. Fuck. Yo, yo! What? I'm leaving. You gotta leave too. - Let's go. - Can I get a ride? Yeah. Whatever. I gotta make a phone call, too, bro. - Please. - Fine, fine. Just don't say anything stupid in front of her. I won't say nothing stupid. And clean that shit off your face. What the fuck do you think I'm trying to do here? - You're gonna scare her. - Get me that phone! Fuck, man. Oh, shit! Oh, it's probably just some bullshit. Hey, Ron, it's me. Listen, I'll explain later. Are you with Mom right now? All right, listen. Is there anybody else in the room with you right now? Oh, fuck. Listen, listen, when I get off the phone with you, you gotta pretend like you just got off the phone with one of your friends or something, all right? All right, it's really important. I gotta call you back later from a different phone. I'll explain everything. All right? All right, I love you, bro. Bye. Whoa, whoa. Why are we going back to the hospital for? I thought that's where you wanted to go. Are you fucking crazy? All right. I'm gonna drop you off at that White Castle. I gotta get something for my brother, anyway. Yo, could you run in and get a number 5 six-piece chicken thing? All right. Get me something too. I'm starving. Just a couple sliders, please. Go ahead. Give me my phone. - Here. - No, no, leave that in here. I wanna use it. All right, bro. She's gone. Let's get the fuck out of here! Let's fucking book it. Driving around in a stolen car? Don't be a fucking idiot. We're waiting for her here. Well, I guess I'm gonna stay in the car, too, then, man. Because you've seen how it is back there. All those fucking cops. And there's fucking cops at my house. I don't think you understand, bro. I just got out of prison yesterday. I'm on fucking parole. I'm fucked. I'm gonna end up back in jail. I am not going back to jail! And these fucking pills aren't doing shit. Man, this is all a bunch of fucking bullshit, man! Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to think. Okay? What do you think I'm trying to do? I'm trying to fucking figure out my shit, too. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I don't remember half the shit that went on yesterday. I don't know if I ended up in the hospital first. Or the precinct first. I don't know if they got my fingerprints. I don't know what the fuck is going on. And I don't remember half of it because I was so goddamned fucked up! I remember being dropped off by a bus. The jail releases me, the bus drops me off right in front of a liquor store on the corner. I mean, after doing two years in jail, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen, man? I'm gonna want a fucking drink. Right away I'm getting a bottle of brandy. I'm already practically broke, with the little money that was left in my account. So I call my boy, Caliph. He comes through with some more liquor. Your boy's home, man. And some sticks of Xanax. My brother! He takes some sticks. I take some sticks. And by now, we're all fucked up. And I'm just feeling so good that I don't even give a fuck. So we both walk over to his boy Trevor's house. This guy who has this hustle going where he moves acid for this guy in the Bronx to this other guy in Long Island. But what they do is, they skim a couple of sheets off the top, you know, so they could have some money on the side for themselves before they make the delivery. Yo, Bells, Belvis, how much was that? Yo, son, hook me up, son. Finish her. You're a three-minute man anyway. Fuck, let me do my thing, man. So I ride with him to Long Island, and I'm thinking the whole time this PO's gonna read me the riot act, 'cause I'm fucking up already, but, I mean... I'm feeling so great, and I'm fucked up. And I just don't give a fuck. I'm celebrating. I'm not gonna spill it. Yo, how much is this shit worth? So I'm at the arcade with Trevor now. You know, we're doing our thing, hustling acid. And, you know, we take over this place. Like it's our fucking office. Once in a while someone will show up and we'll make a sale, you know. Make a sale here. Make a sale there. Twenty? You know... Take that shit and get high, baby boy. A little stronger than last time, I hope. But then, one of Trevor's friends, this clown Donnie walks in. And he's all fucked up. And he's talking about how he just robbed some Radio Shack down the street. Look, check this out. At this point, the acid's kicking in for me, so I can't follow this shit. I'm having a hard time following the story, and I'm starting to freak out a little bit. Bam! Right over his fucking head. And then, guess what happens? The fucking cops show up. And the next thing I know, Trevor's grabbing me, and we just book it into the parking lot. And I just remember thinking I could run for, like, 20 miles straight. It's here, right here. So I'm following Trevor, and it's fucking freezing. He leads us into Adventureland, this amusement park. At this point, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. And then Donnie leads us into this ride, and they look for a place to hide their shit. But it's fuckin' dark in there. I can't see shit. All of a sudden, they get bagged, I'm all by myself in the dark. And literally the next thing I remember is, I'm fucking running down some random street. And I just see a fucking cab. And I hail it, and I just get in. And this driver, he just kept talking to me and talking to me, and I'm fucking tripping balls. And I'm telling him, "Please, please." "Just give me some peace and quiet," "or I'm going to throw up." If you're going to throw up, you give me my money right now and you get out of this car. And I told the driver, "Don't worry. I'm going to go in the house," "I'll get the money from my bag." I just got out of jail today, man. I don't have shit. As soon as he hears the word "jail," he fuckin' freaks. Talking about, "Oh, I'm not getting ripped off" "by one of you punks again." - I am not getting fucked over! - And he just fucking steps on the gas, and that was it. He just takes off. I'm gonna pay you. My mother's gonna pay you. She has money. I'm going to the police, okay! Man, I heard the word "cops," and I lose it. I gotta get the fuck out of here. - Pull over. Fuck this. - You are crazy! I'm not going back to jail, man. I'm not going back to jail. God damn it! So I happen to get one of the doors opened before he locked them all. This guy's crazy. He's fucking driving. He's speeding down the road, 30, 40 miles an hour. And I know we're getting closer and closer to the precinct. I know where my local precinct is. It's not far. And I am not going back to jail. So I just looked down at the pavement and just jump. And now look at my fucking face! I can't go walk around looking like this. Yo. Yo, you listening to me? Yo, you fucking hear me? Yo. Fucking serious? Hello? Hello! Tell you what I think. I'm gonna drive us out there right now, gonna go through the ride, and we split what we find. All right? What, to Adventurers? Right now? Yes. Are you fucking serious? I should be in a fucking bed somewhere right now. You have nowhere to go. You have no plan. And she's coming right now. Did you see all the activity outside the hospital when we drove past? Yeah, the police? Yeah. So I called over there, and there's been a police incident. They're not going to discharge anyone for an hour and a half. So what's going to happen with your brother? I don't know. It's fuckin' nightmare. I'm kinda fucked. So I want to drop him off back at home, then come back to the hospital afterwards. So I'm gonna drop you off back at home, right? Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, drive me home. Where am I going? Yeah, just right up here. Just pull up around back right here. Right here? Yeah, just pull up around back. I don't want to go around front because then the dogs are going to start barking and wake everybody up and stuff. So... Get out for a second. I need to talk to her. You know what? Tonight, it's fucked up as it is. I just think... I think something very important is happening, and it's deeply connected to my purpose. And I think that you are somehow connected to it as well. I mean, do you feel me at all? Or do I just sound like a total faggot? No, I feel you. I understand. Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit in that guy's house. And we'll try the hospital again in a minute. - Just wait here for me, okay? - All right. We can cut right through here. Oh, fuck. Ow! Ow, my fucking shoulder! Power with your legs. Don't use your arms. - Oh, fuck. Shit, man. - Shut the fuck up! I can't do it, man. Tell me where it is. I'll be right back. I'm not telling you where it is. You can wait by the car. That's my ride as well as yours. No, no, no way. We find another way around or something. If I have to come back over there, I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you. You keep pushing me, bro, and I'm gonna forget how fucked up my shoulder is. Motherfucker. You gotta help me over, bro. Come on. Just boost me up. Go. There we go. Go. I'm good. Oh! Fuck me, bro! Oh, shit! Fuck! Here we go. All right, you feel this track right here? - Yes. - Follow it. Um... Yo, check this coffin. Where? Everywhere. Behind it, under it. There's nothing here, man. Try lifting the lid up. This is fucking bolted down. Look, I'm not gonna spend all night looking through everything single thing in here, so think, think harder. All right. I'm trying to fucking think, bro! It was fucking dark, like it is now. It's gotta be farther, let's go father. Come on. Fuck. Right. Got it. This Egyptian shit. I don't know. Maybe this tombstone, man. I think they stashed it here. - Oh, shit! - You got it? Yes! Nah, I found the fucking acid. I don't care about the acid. Are you fucking stupid? Do you know how much this shit is worth? Find the money. Do you recognize any of this? I told you, man. I was fucked up. The cops came in quick. - Oh, shit! - Hey! Y'all need to come out. Stop fucking with me right now. I already called the cops. Yo! Stop playin'. Y'all need to come out right now. If I find you, you gonna get your ass kicked. I'm not fucking around. Show your face. Hey! Oh, fuck! Shit. Fuck! Ow! Hey! Calm down! Hey! - Ow. Fuck! - Hey! I got beat up! I'm the victim here, man. Oh, shit. Where's your friend? - I don't got no friend. - I saw you on the monitor! There's cameras here, okay? I got beat up. I'm the victim. Look at me, man. Oh, come on, bro. I'm gonna show your friend now, huh? I'm not trying to give you no problems, man. All right. Let's wait for your boy to come out. Just let me go. You will never see my face again, I promise. Let's wait for your boy to come out now. Please, man. Come on, bro. Shut the fuck up. There he goes. Hey! Hey! Yo! Oh, shit! Come on! Come on! Get me the fuck outta here! Yo! Yo! Open the door! Yo, cut me the fuck out of these things, man. There's got to be scissors somewhere. Let me see those things. Shit. Let's get the fuck out of here. All right, let's leave him here. Keep looking. Go find it. I want to be in and out of here. Damn you fucked him up. I want to be in and out, all right? In and out! Yo, does any of this black light shit ring a bell? I don't know, man. Just look around. Look under shit. Look behind shit, like I'm doing. The cops came in. They stashed it really quick, man. - What about the boat thing? - The what? The boat. Did you look through the boat? Nah, not yet. Hello! Hello! Nassau County Police. Anybody in there? Fuck! Fuck! Nassau County Police! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit, man. Take his shoes off! Go look for a hiding spot. Don't leave the ride. Hold on, hold on. This motherfucker's not gonna remember shit when he wakes up. Open the fucking mouth. Oh, there you are. What happened? We were yelling at the gate. Sorry, man, I couldn't hear anything. He's inside here. Watch out for the rail. - He's just here. - Oh, shit. What happened to him? I don't know. I just heard a ton of noise outside. I just walked in here, and he's just layin' there like this... Unconscious, I guess. What happened to the other one? - Could we get a bus for a... - The other one... ...lacerations to the face. As soon as I turned the lights on, everybody ran off. Is he still in the park? Maybe. I don't know. You have an ETA? I'm gonna need you to turn all - the lights on in the park. - Copy. Uh... Yeah, just give me a couple of minutes. Hold on. Let me call you back, hold on. 'Cause I just peeped something. Yo, yo, yo. Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Nice strong pulse. He has a good chest rise. He's moving good oxygen. Those whacks are pretty nasty on his forehead though. Hey, bud. Hey. Hey. What's going on, man? Hey. You awake? Hello. Hello. He's a little agitated. Hold on. Hold on to him. Hey, man, it's all right. It's all right. Relax. Relax. Relax. There goes that drug use, huh? Just hold on to his legs. Make sure you got his legs.

One. Two. Three. All right, let's put him on a stretcher. All right. Get off of me! Why are you still holding me, sir? Get off! Get off! Get off of me! Wait, I just explained myself to you. I didn't have to do that. You're not making any sense. This is the girl. Yo! Is this the one that was running around? Nah, it wasn't a girl, bro. I don't know who that is. Look me at, don't look at him. Look at me. How old are you? - I'm 16. - Where's your ID? What are you doing here? You don't want... You don't know, and you don't want to talk to me? Come on. You're outta here. I don't got time for this shit. We'll find somebody that'll talk to us and tell you why you're here, all right? Get her outta here. I'll start her 61. Elmhurst, can I help you?

Who can you call to get some money for this right now tonight? I want to move it right now. That doesn't belong to me. That belongs to my boy, Caliph. Well, then he can pay me for it. Fuck that, man. I'm the one who found it. Not you. You wouldn't have found anything without me. You were handcuffed to a bed in a hospital. What do you think I'm doing this for? You think I'm doing this for charity? All right. You're right. You got a point. I hear you. Listen. My boy will hook you up. He'll throw some money your way. But, my point is, it's not up to me. I gotta call him, all right? - It's not up to me. - You're right. It's not up to you. So get on the phone and call him right now. Plug the phone in. Charge it. And give me a minute.
