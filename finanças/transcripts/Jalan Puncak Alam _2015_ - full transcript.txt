What's wrong with the bike? It feels so heavy. What's wrong? Why does it feel so heavy? Did something ride on the back? I don't see anything. This incident happened few years back. If I'm not mistaken... ... I've fiIIed the tank fulI. Was it today or yesterday? Where are you? I'm on my way to pick Azizi. -How Iong wiII you take? I'm not sure, I haven't seen him yet. Don't forget to filI the petroI. I've never drive my car without tank fuIl of petroI. Sure. When I meet Azizi, I'II ask him to pay for the petroI. Here's one more thing. Drive my car carefulIy. Don't damage it. That car has never caused me any problems before. Don't Iet it break down when in your hand. Yes, I know. What does he does there Iate at night? What is he doing there? -His bike running out of petroI. He ask for my heIp, that's why I'm here. Running out of petrol? Why didn't he fiII the tank in advance? - He's such a troublemaker. - Why are you asking me so many questions? How would l know? Enough with your nag, I'm driving right now. You're scolding me? Are you mad at me? You're borrowing my car then you scoId me? Don't make me double charge. Take care of my car. This Iooks Iike the same road. l've been driving for an hour. l haven't seen anything. Not even a car or bike. How can he use this route? Where is he? Don't cause me trouble. This is Azizi's bike. That's definiteIy his bike. The problem is, where is he? You asked me to pick you up. But when I got here, l onIy saw your bike. It's okay, I'II just wait here. Where have you been? Where are you? I can't be waiting here. I'II just wait. Where is he? It's okay dear, l'll pay. -lt's okay, Iet me pay. It's okay. l forget to ask you about Haswendy. ls it right his name is Haswendy? -Who is that? It's Hasmunir, l forgot. -Haswendy is his neighbour. Why didn't he come for the futsal game the other day? Haven't you heard about it? -About what? I've toId him not to use that road. But he was stubborn. -Road? Which road? JaIan Puncak AIam, what eIse. Right? You know what he told me? When he was using that road... ... riding aIone... ... on his bike, suddenly there was a stink smeIl. It smeIIed very stinky. SmeIIed Iike a carcass. He continued riding like usuaI. Then he saw a white shadow. So he stopped by the road. Then he tried to search where the shadow came from. SuddenIy, ... ... when he turned his head, the shadow was right in front of his face. With bright red eyes. With its face, ... ... and teeth. It Iooked scary. It has a very long hair. lt gives me goosebumps just by teIling you this. Where did you go? -No, I just went... I couldn't reached you number and the reception is bad here. I'm sorry. You're such a troubIesome. l've bring the barreI, Iet's find a petrol pump. You're troubIing me. Honestly, l heIped you because of your sister, Liza. If not, I wouId never come here aIone. Plus, it's dark. Look at the road. There's no other bike using this road. Not onIy bike, l don't even see a car. You said it'Il onIy takes 40 minutes. But that was on the main road. lt took me two hours before I found you. There's one more thing I'd Iike to ask. Don't you have any other road you can use? Do you know it's very dark here? Then, ... this is the nearest route to my house. lf l use other road, it'Il take Ionger to reach home. PIus, l have plenty of assigments need to be done. That's the probIem. lf you finished aIl your work earlier, this wouldn't have happen. We can both get comfortabIe on bed right now. Then I don't have to drive this car. Aren't you scared to use this road? It's pretty scary. But I have no choice. This is the same route. Why does it take so long to find the petroI pump? Hanif. -What? When you were on the way here to pick me up... ... don't you feeI scared? Who's calIing me? Why are you caIIing me? When l called you many times, you didn't answer. But you called me when we're sitting next to each other. Lock the keypad after using the phone. Do I have to teach you that? I'm sorry. Where are you? I just picked up Azizi. How's my car? Your car is fine, don't worry. l'd like to remind you this. Don't forget to filI the petroI. I'II teII Azizi to fiII the petrol fulI. One more thing. Take good care of my car. Don't damage my car, l realIy Iove it. Take a good care of it. Alright, l know. What did Dekjan said? -He was asking about his car. Why? I'm borrowing his car. He's afraid that it might break down. lt is only a smaII car. I can't imagine if it's a Iuxury car Iike Ferrari. lt's annoying. What is that? Let's stop by the roadside. What did I hit? - Did you hear that sound? - I did. Maybe it was the tyre. Everything is fine. The tyre is fine. Everything's fine. There's no probIem, I've checked everything. Did you hear... Where is he? Where are you, Zi? Where did he go? What's wrong with the car? Where did you go? -I want to take a Iook at the car too. You don't have to, just sit next to me. l'm the one who's driving, let me do it. -AIright then. Get inside. Luckily he's my future brother in law. Else, I wouId've smack him. Hanif. -What? - Did you hear that? - I did, that's why I checked the car. No, I heard a children's voice from the bush. Think IogicalIy. There's no kid in a bush. Don't be ridiculous, get inside. -l can't do that. Waith here for a while. Let' me take a Iook. Don't, get back inside. -Wait a minute. He's acting crazy. No way there's a kid's voice inside the bush. He is such a troubIe. It's easy for you to walk throught the bush with shoes. I'm only weaking sIippers. What voice did you hear. I don't get it. Where is he? Don't fooI around here! Are you defecating? Stop fooIing around, Zi! This wilI be the first and the Iist time I'lI ever heIp you. I wouId never help you anymore after this. This is not the right place to fool around. We're in a jungIe! How can you say you heard a kid's voice. Zi, there's no kid around here! He's such a troubIesome. I was looking for you all over the place, and there you are in the car. You're such a troubIe. l was looking for you in the bush, but you're here in the car. When l get inside a car, you wanted to go to the bush. Can you please don't leave the car after this? Just stay inside! How can he disappear? That shocked me. Where are you? l'm in the car. Where are you? I looked for you in the bush but didn't find you. I got lost. Can you help me? Don't give me trouble. Get out of the bush by yourseIf. l'll wait for you in the car. Hurry up! What is his probIem? I'm sorry, Hanif. How long have you been waiting? I went to defecate just now. You've caused so many problems. Get inside. What about your stuff? Let me go get it. Where do you want to go? -Picking up my stuff. There's no need. We'll come back later, right? There's no need. We'll pick them up later. Where's the petrol pump? -Just right there. What's wrong with you? Did you have the barrel that I asked you to bring? lt's at the back. That's good, then. How can Dekjan Iet you borrow his car? Of course. But with a condition. What is it? Dekjan ask me to teII you to fiII the petroI fulI. But I add another condition. Don't be like this. I don't have much money. I'm helping you with this. I cna't be doing it for free. AIright, fine. I'm running out of cigarette. Buy me a box of cigarette when we reach the petroI pump. Please. Please. Why are you caIIing me? When I caIled just now, you didn't answer. Now yu're caIIing me. Next time, lock the keypad after using th ephone. Do l have to teach you that? -l'm sorry. I think we better stop for a whiIe. Why does he wants to stop right now? Don't be ridiculous, Zi. Don't you feeI weird? We've been driving around for two hours. But we haven't seen any petrol pump. What can we do if we stop? Ask someone the direction? Does it look like someone's staying here? There's no other bike or car that use this road. But what if the car runs our petrol? Right there. I saw someone riding a bike. Drive past him so we can ask him for directions. Overtake him. Go stop him. Why me? Go stop him and ask where's the nearest petroI station. l don't want to. Why don't you go. Me? I've to do it? I've to do everything? He's aImost here. Go stop him. Sorry for disturbing you. I'd like to ask, where's the nearest petroI station here? Did your car running out of petroI? -No, it wasn't my car. It was my friend's bike. The probIem is, ... ... we've been driving the same road for two hours. I don't know what to do. If you keep going straight, you won't find any petroI station. There's a fallen tree over there. OnIy a bike can pass. You better go back. There's a petrol station about 10 kiIometres away. Can you please show us the way? Sorry, I can't. If I go, someone else wouId take my pIace. Let's do it this way. Let me give you the direction. That wiIl do. You turn back and go straight. - Turn back and go straight. - Then go to the left. ln about two kilometres, you'lI find a smalI town. There's a ptroI station there. - Turn back around. - Yes. Go straight and take left on the tee junction. -Yes, take Ieft. l'll try that. Thank you. -AIright. He's so cute. What did he say? This is such a mess. There's a tree feIl across the road in front. He telI us to turnaround. Go straight, there's a tee junction. Then take Ieft. The problem is, I didn't see any tee junction when I was on my way here. Cute? What are you looking at? Hurry, make a turn. You're so annoying. l'd Iike to ask you something? Just ask. Did anything happen whiIe you were waiting for me? What do you mean? Who knew you might saw something. Something like what? Just forget it. Can I ask you something? Just ask. About you and my sister. How Iong have you been together? You don't know how long we've been together. I don't feeI Iike answering that question. My sister doesn't tell me everything about her Iife. lt has been 4 months. OnIy four months? That's just recentIy. What? That's quite Iong. This is my first time being in a relationship for four months. l've never do it before. Enough about that. We need to Iook for a petroI station. That guy told me to go straight til we get to a tee junction. Then take Ieft. I didn't see any tee junction on my way here. What should I do? Zi, do you see that? See what? -There, on your bike. There's a little boy on your bike. Didn't you see that? When l fell asIeep whiIe waiting for you, l dreamt of that boy. That boy on your bike look exactIy Iike the one in my dream. Didn't you see him? Your dream? Yes, my dream. You didn't see him? No, I didn't. Just forget it. -What did the boy do there? How wouId I know what he is doing there. How could you ask that? What is that sound? What's wrong with this car? What's wrong with this car? What is wrong now? -What's wrong, Nip? I don't know what's the probIem with this car. There, it's fine. There you go. What's wrong with this car? Dekjan would be mad at me. CaIm down, try again. Why don't you take a look at the engine. Who knew you might get it start. Take a look at the engine. -Yes, I'm going to. Zi, open the bonnet. Where is it? -Try find it at the side. I couIdn't find it. -What's the probIem with you? Right here! You don't even know that. -Don't be angry. How wouId I know. I'm done. I'm so done. Which one shouId I fix? Maybe l ran out of petroI. It can't be that. You can stiII see a bar there. What shouId I teII him? Where are you going? Let me take a Iook. Who knew I can fix it. How can you do it when l can't? Are you that smart? Do it! Zi, what took you so Iong? Can you do it? Let me try it. The engine stiIl won't start. You took so Iong but stiIl couIdn't fix it. What took you so Iong? Where did he go now? You're giving me probIem one after another. This is a big problem. Where are you. -l just picked up Azizi. How's my car? -That's the thing. Your car is stiIl fine so far. Are you sure? -Yes. There's no problem? -No probIem. You're not lying to me? -Why wouId I do that to you? lf you don't lie to me, fine then. Drive my car carefuIly. Make sure you fiII the petroI fuII tank. As ususal. l'Il ask Azizi to pay for the petroI. Don't worry. Alright then. Drive the car carefuIIy. Yes, I know. Why do you Iike giving me probIems? Everything is keep giving me problems! Where did you came from? It's already late. Why are you using this route? lt's a long story, uncle. I came to heIp a friend. His bike is running out of petroI. Where? Just around this area. Where is your friend? Try starting the engine. Sure. lt's fine now. - Thank you so much, uncle. - It's okay. Just a small matter. Forgive me for asking. Where are you from and where are you heading to? l was sending my chiId back to the coIlege. Luck was not on his side. He missed the bus from SIim River Iast night. I was from his colIege. l need to leave. -Okay, uncIe. - It's already late. - Alright. One probIem down. The probIem now is, where's Azizi? I think l want to Ieave him here. You want to be left here? So be it. Where is he? ls he answering the caII of nature? You shouId've inform me first. Now you went missing and want me to wait you here. So troubIesome. What took him so Iong? What is wrong with you? Where did you go? I went there for a whiIe. Answering the caIl of nature? SmalI or big? Small? Big? You're a grown man but stiIl urinating and defecating everywhere. Don't let it get swoIIen. With our problem, still couIdn't find the petrol station. Then you went missing just like that. Don't do that. I'm the one who'II be in trouble. I'm the one who borrowed Dekjan's car. lt'Il be me who has to answer him if anything happen. Luckily the car is fine. I don't have to face Dekjan. How did you managed to fix the car? WhiIe you were away just now... ... there was this uncle. Then? He drove by so l stopped him. So he helped me. Then the car is fine. An uncIe using this road? Using this road at this wee hour? He is from the coIlege. But I feeI pity at him. His son missed the bus from SIim River. That is so far. ColIege? As far as l know, the onIy colIege around here... ... is my coIIege. But why did he sent his son to the coIlege? We're on semester break. This is weird. Where are you from and where are you heading to? I went to sent my son back to his colIege. Big vehicle couldn't go through that road, onIy a bike Iike mine. I'd Iike to ask you something. Where are you from and where are you heading to? I went to sent my son back to his colIege. UnfortunateIy, ... He got unIucky, he missed the bus... ... from Slim River last night. That's why l sent him here. l need to Ieave now. It's already late. I'm running out of breath. Wait. Why is this happening to me? l stiIl have a lot of assignments to finish up. What's your probIem? l've fiIl the tank full. SuddenIy, you're running out of petroI. ls there any Ieaking? Even though l know there's no petroI Ieft, I stilI going to try. Because I've been walking this far. You keep causing me trouble. Obviously you won't start, there's no petrol left. l'm so stupid. Why there is no one driving pass this road? I'm so exhausted. Hanif is another probIem. He promised to fetch me, but still hasn't arrived. What took him so Iong? l've been waIking this far. lf l join a marathon, l wouId've win the race. HopefuIly there's a shop ahead. What's wrong? Don't you feel weird? Didn't you said now is a semester break? Why did that uncIe sent his son to the coIIege? One more thing. Remember that guy who's going for fishing? He said there's a tree fell across the road ahead. OnIy bikes can pass through that road. When we turnaround and I saw that boy on your bike... ... you said you didn't see anything. I don't understand this. l don't know whether l'm sane or crazy. l don't know what to say and I'm aII messed up. I don't want to think anymore. Like you said earIier. Leave your bike here and we'Il pick it up tomorrow. Who's caIIing me at this hour? My goodness. How many times do l have to telI you? Lock your phone after using it. Lock your keypad. Don't make me Ieave you here. So annoying. Don't be mad. I'm sorry. Where's Hanif? He said he wouId fetch me. But he's stiIl not here yet. l hope you don't falI back asleep. Let's just leave this pIace. We'II pick up your bike tomorrow. Who's caIling now? Now is not the time to fooI around with me. How many time should l teIl you this? Lock your phone. Are you trying to mke me angry? Don't make me leave you here. Understood? Do you understand?! Where's Hanif? He's still not here yet. You aIready waiting for the Nasi Lemak. No, I'm not. I'm waiting for my friend. Friend? My bike is running out of petroI. l was waiting for my friend at the back road. I've waited for a whiIe and I feeI a IittIe uneasy That's why I pushed my bike untiI here. Luckily there's this brother who's selIing Nasi Lemak. Else, l wouId've freaked out. So, do you want me to heIp? Can you? -Why not? Next time bring an extra petroI Iike me. But I can't give it to you. There's only a little Ieft. Like this. Let me take you to the petroI station. Sure. Take that key. I hope that kid that I met earIier found the petrol station. Which kid? -There's this kid I met. I want to give him mine but I onIy have a IittIe. He need it for his car and bike too. ln the end l might be the one who'lI be pushing the bike. l pity that feIIa. What car is he driving? If I'm not mistaken, it was a KanciI. KanciI? -Yes. Can you help me? I'm running out of petroI. I'm at the road heading to Puncak AIam. Just borrow someone's car. Dekjan has a KanciI right? Just teII him you want to fetch me. Hurry up. Where are you going? -I want to go find my friend. I think you better find him after dawn. Why? lt's impossibIe to find him in dark Iike this. What do you mean? Like this. When I met your friend, ... ... there was something eIse in his car. What is it? I think l saw a little boy. A little boy? Go stop him. Yes, you go. Ask him where we can find a petrol station. Me? I've to do everything? Okay, fine. You're such a troubIesome. I'II try. Zi, pIease open the front bonnet. Try find it on that side. Can you... This one! What's so difficuIt? You mean... ... that thing is with my friend right now? That thing exist here. It aIways disturb people around here. There was one time... ... someone saw a IittIe kid pIaying on the road. Another person... ... saw a woman... ... sat at the back of the bike. But the worst one... ... it foIlows people home. No wonder I feel uneasy just now. That's why I didn't stay there and Ieave that pIace. It is normaI for pIaces Iike that. Maybe that is its pIace. The one where they make the road. We make road on their pIace. That's why they disturb us. Then... ... what about my friend? I haven't finish last week's assignment. Now here's a new one. That's a Iot of work. l feel so tired. I don't know what to do. That's Azmi. Mi! Mi, stop! Don't you want to go home with him? Switch it off. -Can you switch off the engine first? Switch it off. Your bike is so noisy. Why didn't you tell me you want me to swtich it off? Listen to me. -Yes. Are you sure you don't want to go home with him? l don't mind sending you home. But first, you've to pay for the petroI. You think I bought this bike so that I couId hitch a ride with you? I better ride my own bike. I'm a true biker, so I'II ride my bike. I don't mind that. But I was informed that there's a road block at the junction. Have you renewed your license? I've thought so. No, I haven't. Then, which route are you going to use? Which route? Jalan Puncak AIam. -Puncak AIam? Puncak Alam. -Are you serious? Do you that many people have been disturb when using that road? You can't be using that road? - That road? - Yes. Where thare's a wiII, there's a highway. The probIem is, that's not a highway. That's a haunted road. Do you understand? You've started talking nonsense. TaIking about ghost. Do you think the ghost is that great? It could chase my powerful bike? lf l push to 180km/h, I don't think it couId sit at the back. This is a powerfuI bike. It's a waste of time talking to you. Let's go. Up to you. -Do you think I want to taIk to you? TaIking about ghost. l'm the one who's going to use that road. It's nice that you're driving a car. You don't even care about me. You're so inconsiderate. Is there realIy a ghost at the Puncak AIam's route? There's no way there are ghosts there. What's wrong with the bike? It feels very heavy. What is wrong? Why does it feel very heavy? Is something riding at the back? There's nothing at the back.
