MAN: Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Well, hello there. As you already know, this is my favourite time of year. There is nothing more magical than seeing the faces of children during Christmas time. Families spending time together, eating delicious food, and feeling the love that connects all of us. But every year, there are those who stop believing in the magic of Christmas. And we just can't let that happen now, can we? No, of course not. And that takes us to Christmas Eve, where we're expecting seasonal temperatures along with a chance of snow. So what you're saying is that with a little Christmas magic, we could have some snow on Christmas Eve. Well, Santa's sleigh does run better in the snow. Doesn't it, Harper? It sure does, Brad. Reporting live from the Christmas skate-a-thon, I'm Harper Hart, Channel 9 News. And we're out. Christmas magic, my foot. You know, the guys in the studio told me you're a bit of a... Grinch? You should be happy you're on holidays now until the New Year, right? Great, I get to spend the next couple of days surrounded by all things Christmas. Rather be working. Grinch. Do you know why it snows? Ice crystals - they form in the upper clouds and when the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius and there's precipitation, we get snow. And that's all because of magic, right? No, it's science, not magic. [CLEARS THROAT AND GROANS] Oh, no. Hello, Mrs Hart. We were hoping we could get a photo with you. Of course. [CAMERA CLICKS] And then I went on a rant about there being no such thing as magic. And when I turned around there were all these kids there waiting to take a photo. Well, if you ask me, it sounds kind of funny. No, not funny, Brad. There are kids here. Pumpkin, everyone makes mistakes. BRAD: You're a wonderful woman. Don't sweat it. Thank you. I knew you'd make me feel better. HARPER: So, what time are you picking me up? Uh... picking you up? We're going to my parents place, remember? Um... I'm having lunch with the station managers. I think they want me to host my own segment on the evening telecast. Isn't that great? Yeah, but we were gonna help my family set up the last of their Christmas decorations. Harper, you and I both dislike Christmas and Christmas decorations, so... True, but my family loves this stuff. It would be easier for me to deal if you were here. Cancelled on me three times. Harper, I gotta go. [SIGHS] Gentlemen, thank you for waiting. Brad? Hello? Oh, I hate it when he gets this way. Well, I hope your meeting goes really, really well, Brad. Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Be careful. You might end up on my naughty list. You're right. I'm sorry, sir. I hope everything is OK. Yes, sir, it's uh... It's nothing. You can call me Santa if you like. It's not really my thing. Nonsense, Harper. I saw you earlier with that Santa hat and those wonderful Christmas earrings. You recognize me from the television. I only dress like this when I'm on the air. My producer makes me. Well, your producer is going on the nice list. You might want to double check that one. I'm... kidding. My producer is a great guy. Most of the time. Well, let's see if we can get some of that Christmas spirit back in you. Sure. But I actually have to go right now. I'm really sorry to cut this conversation short. It was really nice to meet you. And great Santa suit. Very authentic. Thank you. My wife made it. And your beard, you can barely even tell that it's fake. Good job. [UPBEAT MUSIC] ♪ Winter floats, confetti in December sky ♪ ♪ While the stars twinkle like Christmas lights ♪ ♪ Jack Frost turned the skating pond to ice ♪ ♪ And snow covers... The most wonderful time of the year. Humbug. Hey! It's me! There's my baby, Harp. Mum. BOTH: Mmm. Where's your boyfriend? Good question. - I thought he was coming. - So did I. He had a work thing that popped up. Oh, that poor man works too hard. - Hey, Dad. - Hey! - Mark. - Hey. [EXCITED SQUEALING] Harper! Hi, Holly. Hi. - Can I borrow you for a minute? - Sure. I'm so glad you're here. It's nice to see you too, little sis. Mistletoe. Candy cane. What? Family mistletoe - you have to find the magic one. OK, why does everyone keep bringing up magic this time of year? Look, Holly, I've told you like a hundred times, there is no such thing as magic. OK, our grandparents, our parents, Mr and Mrs Drinknight, Barry and Terry, our cousin Heather, and the guy she married... - Peter. - Peter. - And then Stephanie's... - OK, coincidence. Highly uncommon coincidence but coincidence nonetheless. When people kiss under our family's mistletoe, they fall in love. Period. Fact. Undeniable. Holly... - Oh my gosh. - Shh. Mum and Dad don't know yet. I'm so happy for you. And this is why I need that mistletoe. You had it last year when you volunteered to host Christmas dinner, remember? - Volunteered? - Yeah. OK, the terms 'peer pressure, guilted and shamed' come to mind. OK, fine. I have it somewhere in my condo. I'll look for it tonight. Thank you. OK, bring it to dinner on Christmas Eve. I'm gonna hang it in the doorway to the family room and make sure Mark and I are accidentally standing under it at the same time. Before me. Hey, you still have Brad. By the way, where is he? [SIGHS] So I'm up for anything. They were going back and forth and then Nelson mentions the possibility of me hosting my own investigative series. - That's great. - I know. I mean, it's super premature I mean, it speaks to so many things. I think I'm gonna order Chinese. Are you in? Hold on. Are we going out for dinner tonight? Oh, pumpkin, I can't. It's gonna be a late night for me and I've got a bunch of stuff to finish up here at the station, so... Yeah, no worries. Elle and I are gonna do Chinese. OK, great. Just the place that I'm at in my career, and my look, and just like the physical presence I bring, I think it's gonna be, really, So, your sister's getting engaged? Yep. And she's younger than you, right? Yep. I just wish we were on the same page with this relationship, you know. Yeah, I get it. And it looks like he might be getting a promotion. Yeah, looks like it. So, how does he feel about you trying to get your own promotion? Well, I haven't exactly told him that I'm aiming for my own promotion. Really?! So, let me get this straight. You want him to take the relationship more seriously, and yet you haven't told him about your promotion? Possible... promotion. I thought we were getting Chinese food. Oh... yeah. The pizza guy - way cuter! - Fair enough. - [CHUCKLES] Hey, do you remember what I did with that box of Christmas decorations that I had here a year ago? Yeah. It used to be in my storage unit. You asked me to hold onto it for you. "Used to be"? Uh-huh. What? I needed the space. You said you didn't want anything in there... Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no. I can't believe it's not here. My family's gonna kill me. We have checked every box. She's never gonna forgive me. [GASPS] Is this yours? Or mine? That one's mine. Oh... cool. Can I have it? You know me and hats. Sure. [MOUTHS] Yes. Why don't you just buy new mistletoe? There's no way. That mistletoe was... special. Special? Hart family legend says that my grandparents first kissed under that mistletoe on Christmas and were married soon after. Since then, anyone who kisses under the mistletoe is married before the following Christmas. A magic mistletoe? Why didn't you tell me? We need to keep looking! OK, there is no such thing as magic. It's just some silly story. But everybody feels like it's magic. And now I'm the one who's lost it. At Christmas time too? Ouch! Thanks, Elle. You know, I forgot it was Christmas time. It was an accident. Your family will understand. You don't understand. My family loves Christmas. They always have. And I just... You're a grinch. Christmas just isn't my thing. Mm, maybe there's magic... Or luck... Or fun? You know what you need! A magic mistletoe? A Christmas miracle! Right, because even though magic doesn't exist, miracles do. Why don't you believe? Because I'm an adult. There's no such thing as magic or miracles or luck. If you want something, you work hard to get it. Well, that's your opinion. No, it's literally a fact, Elle. Hard work is the answer. Is hard work gonna fix this problem for you? Or will it take a little magic? Or like I like to say... A miracle of the Christmas variety! Hard work. Really? When did you drop off the boxes? Last week. Why? We'll go to the thrift store first thing in the morning and buy it back. I mean, the chances that someone got it are small, right? So it's gotta be there. Yeah, it's possible, but... Positive thinking, Elle. [SIGHS] OK. [BOTH SQUEAL EXCITEDLY] [DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES] [MAN OVER PA] Attention, shoppers, if you're looking for a holiday gift this year for Christmas... Oh, my gosh! So cute! Oh! Gotta be here, right? It should be. [WHISTLING] Can I help you, ladies? Uh, yes, I'm looking for a mistletoe. Well, there are plenty right there in front of you. True. But these aren't the right one. Looking for something in particular... Harper? You know Harper? Yes, that's me - Harper Hart, Metro News, Channel 9 meteorologist. Wow! A lot of Christmas you're sporting there. Yeah. I am the manager. Perfect. It's an heirloom, actually. Irreplaceable. OK. I mean, well, technically it wasn't her fault per se. I told her she could throw away anything that was in the storage unit. You really don't recognize me, do you? I'm sorry, should I? Wait. Are you... Are you Tracey's ex-boyfriend, Steve? - I do know Tracey. - Great. So, Steve, can you help me find my family's beloved mistletoe? But my name's not Steve. Luke. Your name's Luke. I mean, of course I remember you, Luke. I don't think you do. Yeah, I'm with Luke on this one. I don't think you remember him either. Sure I do. Luke, you know, it's just been a while. How have you been? OK, I gotta get back to work. But good luck finding your special mistletoe. No, wait. Please. I need your help. It's not for me. It's for my family. And they love Christmas more than anyone. You want me to help you find your mistletoe? Yes. The one that your neighbour accidentally donated, but that you can't find now, Yes. And I'll... I'll clean that up. How exactly can I help? I mean, someone's obviously bought it, right? Well, maybe we can ask your sales people if they remember anyone buying it? Or we can check the security footage, huh? Yeah. To look for the person who may have bought your missing mistletoe? BOTH: Yeah! OK. When did you bring the decorations? Last week. It was Thursday. I remember because I went to the pizza place that day. All right, Thursday I sold one box of decorations. Do you remember to who? Yeah, to my aunt, actually. Can we check the security camera footage and see if it was my mistletoe she bought? Look, I know that the chances are small, but I'm desperate. Well, it will take a Christmas miracle. That's what I said! LUKE: OK. Did you work at Metro News? We had a Luke there a couple of years ago. He was a sound guy. Nope. OK, this is really starting to bug me. Where do we know each other from? Oh, I'm not gonna tell you. Now you're just being mean. You might end up on the naughty list. So, Luke, you, uh... really seem to like Christmas. Oh, doesn't everybody? You'd think. And uh... ahem, your girlfriend, is she big into Christmas too? Oh, I don't actually have a girlfriend. Oh! Interesting. You know what else is really interesting - security camera footage. I get this is a family heirloom and all, but you seem to be taking this really seriously. Well, I might not care for the holidays, but my family loves Christmas. And my sister thinks that her boyfriend's gonna propose to her, so she needs this mistletoe to work its magic. So, basically, I'm saving Christmas for you and your family? If you need to feel special about yourself, sure, you can put it that way. Mm. Or I could just go back to work. WOMEN: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! LUKE: OK. [CLEARS THROAT] Got it. And there's my aunt on Thursday and... Looks like she bought the whole box. That's it. That's the box that I brought in. So my aunt has the box. - That's great. - Hm. Now what? You give me her address and I go over there. I can't do that. I'm not gonna break into her house and rob her. Luke! Lukey, my man! Trust me, I know Harper and there's only like a 40% chance that she would ever do something that crazy. Yeah, I'm just gonna knock on the door and offer to buy it back. I'll go with you. She... She doesn't live too far from here. Great. Well, you two might have all the time in the world, but I actually have to work this afternoon. Looks like you guys are on your own. Just... Luke and I? Oh, yeah. Did we go to college together? Close. Come on. Why can't I remember where we've met? Well, it says more about you than it does me. Can you please just tell me? OK, sure. You and I... Hello. Hi. Is Katherine here? Yes, she is. Kitty Kat, it's for you. Please, come in. Thanks. Hi. She'll be here in a second. I'm making cookies. So, who is that guy? I have no idea. I thought my aunt was single. Luke, honey, look at you! What a sweet surprise! - Katherine, how are you? - Oh! Whoa! I'm sorry to come unannounced like that. Oh, don't be silly. You can drop by anytime. And who is this lovely lady? Lovely la... Oh, sorry, Aunt Katherine. This is Harper. Harper, this is my aunt. So, Katherine, I have a business proposition... Is she your girlfriend? Uh, no, no. She's uh... an old friend. Really? - Really? - Yeah. Aunt Katherine, who was that man that answered the front door? That's Robert. He's my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? Since when do you have a boy... Before we get too far off track here, can I just ask you about the decorations? Decorations? I love decorations. Oh, no, not these ones. What's wrong with these ones? Um, nothing. Um, Aunt Katherine, the other day you came by the store and bought a box of decorations. So? Well, Harper here... I donated them by accident. Well, technically, my neighbour did. But, regardless, I need them back. You want them back? Yes. I'm sure she'd be willing to buy them back from you. Yes, what he said. But I don't have them anymore. LUKE: Oh... Here you go - freshly baked Christmas cookies. KATHERINE: Thank you, Robbie bear. ROBERT: Anything for my Kitty Kat. KATHERINE: Oh... [PURRS] [KISSING SOUNDS] [KATHERINE LAUGHS LOUDLY] All right, wait, how do you two... So, the Christmas decorations, what happened to them and where are they? Oh, they weren't for me. - Who were they for? - Santa. What? His photo booth needed some extra decorations, so he asked me to help. Christmas cookie? Why not? Oh, sure. - Oh... - [LAUGHTER] LUKE: OK. Thank you, Robert. You're welcome, Harper. Wait. Harper? Harper Hart, the weather person from Metro News? That's me. Look-a here, Kitty Kat, you have a celebrity in the house. Well, I wish I had known, then I would have cleaned up a little. Look at you, Luke. You were always lucky with the ladies. Oh, no, we're not dating. And I was never lucky with ladies. You're right. You weren't very lucky. But look at her! She's cute as a button! Katherine... Is it Brad Rockwood from Channel 9, huh? He's a handsome man. Brad? No. No. They can't date. That would be improper. She's right. Your nephew is plenty... good looking. But I feel like we're getting off track again. Your mall Santa friend - where can we find him? He has a cute little photo stand in the Antique Mall, just over on Main Street. Oh, that's not far. Thank you. - Let's go. - Yeah. Actually, just... Wait. When did all this happen? How did you two meet? Actually, it had to do with that box of decorations. Really? Um, how? I was dropping them off to my Santa friend and I was jumping into the cab. Ta-da! And wouldn't you know it - Robert was driving! ROBERT: We knew each other years ago but we lost contact. He offered to buy me a coffee. And here we are a week later. KATHERINE: Mm. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Go now? - Yeah, absolutely. OK, thanks, guys. We'll see you later. [BOTH LAUGH] All right, this is amazing - a real magic mistletoe. What are you talking about? OK, hear me out. Yep. Don't even suggest it. I'm not suggesting, I'm just saying, I'm glad that my aunt had some of the mistletoe magic rub off on her. Are you suggesting that your aunt and Robert met because of a mistletoe? Yeah, usually these things only happen in the movies. Did you see how cute they were together? Old people are always cute together. I'm just glad she had a chance to buy your magic mistletoe. OK, there is no such thing as magic. And there's certainly no such thing as a magic mistletoe. OK. Then how do you explain them running into each other? Random, probably. I have a feeling this is gonna be a magical Christmas. Really? Yeah. Oh, no. What? We missed it. Well, I guess we'll continue our search for the missing magic mistletoe tomorrow. Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve and I need to bring it to my parents place. All right, well, I'll meet you there in the morning. We'll have plenty of time. And we will find it, I promise. Oh, a promise. And I always keep my promises. Thank you for all of your help, Luke. I owe you one. [LUKE CHUCKLES] Well, um... I guess I could use a little help in something I'm doing this afternoon, if you're free. Well, since my search for the missing mistletoe is postponed until tomorrow, looks like I have some free time on my hands. Great. Great. Hey, Luke, thanks for the winter jackets you donated last week. Really helped Mrs Mitchell's family. Hey, it's my pleasure. Happy to help. Do you volunteer here a lot? Yeah. Yeah, it's a difficult time for some people. So I help out as much as I can. You know, making lunches and warm meals, I try to help people and families that need an extra hand. Who are you? OK, no, seriously, who are you? You gotta tell me how we know each other because it is bugging me. OK. We went to school together. What? What school? All of them. Well, I mean, from grade school to junior high to real high school. - No, we didn't. - Yeah, we did. No, it's not possible. I would have recognized you. OK. Picture me 50 pounds heavier, terrible brush cut, and always reading comic books. Lucas? Oh, my gosh, it is you. What happened? Wha... Well... [CHUCKLES] Let's see, freshman year of college, I ditched the comic books and started socialising more. Sophomore year, I joined the water polo club. And, by senior year, I lost a lot of weight and I guess gained a fresh perspective on life. Well, congratulations, I... guess. Thank you... I guess. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to come out like that. It's just, wow! Do you want a coffee or something? I actually hate coffee, but I like tea. English breakfast. Oh, OK. Well, I think you might be in luck 'cause we just might have some of that here. Get you one. How's the tea? It's perfect. Great. - So, your neighbour... - Elle. Elle, yes. She pulled me aside back at the thrift store. Oh, no. Did she say anything inappropriate? No. Does she usually? Elle can be... direct. Oh. Well, we just talked. But she's now following me on social media. - Which one? - All of them. Yeah, Elle can get like that around cute guys. Oh. Um... So now I'm cute. - No. - Oh. What I meant was that... she... Elle obviously thinks that you are. Oh, OK. But, you don't... Oh, you know... You have nice hair. And muscles. And smile. And you are kind of saving the world, so maybe like a little bit. Wow. Just said I'm kinda cute. Are you blushing? Maybe. OK, now that is cute. I bet Elle wishes she was here to see that. Well, she can. I got an idea. What? For Elle? OK, well, maybe for all my old high school buddies, since they won't believe I'm hanging out with Harper Hart. OK. For Elle and your high school buddies. All right. Here we go. [CAMERA CLICKS] - Oh... mm. - That is horrible. What? Why? But I can't figure out which one is the hostage and which one's the hostage taker. - Oh... - I'm a professional. OK. [CAMERA CLICKS] Mm. Wow, you're good at this. Yeah, I use the selfies with fans. Wait, weather people have fans? Why does it look like you're taking a photo with your aunt? - Uh... - Let's try that again. Just... get closer. - Smile. - OK. [CAMERA CLICKS] Um... Well, this... This'll do. Yeah. And your high school buddies. - I should go. - Yeah, I should too. I got stuff to do back at the store. So, uh, I'll see you tomorrow? You don't have to come. I mean, I've already borrowed so much of your time. And tomorrow's Christmas Eve, so you probably have plans. No, my family's all out of the city and don't have a girlfriend or a cat or a dog. Not even a goldfish. [LUKE CHUCKLES] Plus I want to see your magic mistletoe. Who knows - maybe it'll bring me luck. OK. OK. [CHRISTMAS MUSIC] So he's gorgeous AND he does volunteer work? Yep. And you two were just hanging out? What else were you expecting? I don't know. Maybe dinner. Or at least a future plan for dinner. Elle, I have a boyfriend. No, you don't. What you have is... a Brad. Who is my boyfriend. Kinda. If he's your boyfriend... then what's that all about? That is just... two old friends catching up. With two VERY big smiles. OK, I told him he has a cute smile. Why would you do that? I don't know. Just came up in conversation. OK, circle of truth... do you like Luke? - No. - Really? Because it seems like you do. - No. - OK, then. I guess you won't mind if I ask him out. No, of course not. Really? Yeah. I mean, go for it. - He's a great guy. - Mm-hm. I mean, maybe don't ask him out right away because it is the holidays and it might be weird. So, maybe in like, uh, a month or two. A month or two? Yeah. ♪ I made a promise ♪ On Christmas Eve ♪ To cut back on ♪ All the holiday treats ♪ No more empty calories ♪ No sugar... HARPER: Thanks again for coming with me today. I'm sure the store is busy. LUKE: Oh, no, I'm always closed on Christmas Eve. I let the big stores handle the last-minute shoppers. - Smart. - [LUKE CHUCKLES] Oh... There he is. What gave it away? Was it the red suit, hat and beard? [LUKE CHUCKLES] Hello. Hi, Mr Santa. Hello! Hey, it's not Mr Santa, just Santa. - Santa? - Yeah. Can I help you, Miss? Oh, no, it's just Santa. Told you. His last name is Claus. Technically it would be Mr Claus, but everyone just calls him Santa. We're not asking Santa for any presents. We just need to ask him to give us something back that's very important to me for Christmas. Oh, really? Maybe it does sound like I'm asking for presents, but we're not. Back in the line. BOTH: OK. ♪ Frosty has his top hat ♪ Rudolph, his red nose... Oh, come on, who could be this agitated waiting in line to get their photo with Santa? No, it's... It's not that. It's my boyfriend. He just said there's a chance that he might not be able to meet my family tonight. Your boyfriend? You mentioned him the other day. Yeah. Yeah, he's just some guy from work. He's been really busy lately. Well, it's Christmas time, it's the holidays. People get busy. This holiday makes people crazy. Hey, since when have you stopped liking Christmas? You weren't always this way. What do you mean? And at Christmas time, your house was THE most decorated I've ever seen. - Yeah, and still is. - Really? But that was my family's doing, not mine. Oh... OK. Well, growing up around all this Christmas cheer, how did you become such a um... A grinch? I didn't say it. No, but it's true. I am. So? It's a long story. Oh, well... we got time. When I was a kid... Mm? ...I loved my grandma so much. She was this amazing woman. She was a scientist back when women weren't usually scientists. Oh, wow. Yeah. She was so smart. I got my love of science from her. We were like best friends. Mm. Sounds like an amazing role model to grow up with. Yeah. She was. And then, just before Christmas, when I was nine, she passed away. Oh, Harper... I'm sorry. That... That must have been so difficult. Yeah. Yeah, it was. I was devastated. And before I knew it, the holidays came around and my parents did what they always did. They decorated the house, they were acting like they were happy. And I guess I resented it. I couldn't understand how they could just move on with Christmas and life without her. It just felt fake. Well, you were a kid. That's understandable. I guess this whole buying presents and throwing parties this time of the year, regardless of what's going on in our lives, just feels forced. Mm. Like people going through the motions. I think people build traditions so that as generations change, they can be honoured and remembered. Regardless of what people are doing in their lives, I feel they use the yearly traditions, they keep families together. They bring happiness in the good time and peace and comfort in the difficult times. Going through the motions, as you say, just... it brings comfort into people's lives when they're going through a difficult time. You're very lucky that your family still celebrates together. Never thought of it that way. Thank you. Folks, you're next. Oh... OK. Santa! Sit down, young man. Oh, you're really... sitting down. OK. [LUKE LAUGHS EXCITEDLY] Oh, you'll have to excuse my friend here, Santa. [WHISPERS] She's not the biggest fan of Christmas these days. Oh, it seems Harper hasn't been a fan of Christmas for a while now. You again? I saw him a few days ago at the ice rink. A Santa at Christmas? Weird. No, like, literally the exact same Santa. It's nice seeing you again, Harper. Are we ready to get a picture taken with Santa Claus? Sure. Why not? So, Harper, weren't you gonna ask Santa? Oh, right, the mistletoe. Santa, a few days ago, a woman named Katherine... My aunt. Yes, Aunt Katherine. She brought in a box of Christmas decorations. Yes, she did. And getting my own. [SANTA AND LUKE HO-HO HEARTILY] HARPER: OK. So, in that box of Christmas decorations was a mistletoe that is very important to me and my family. A mistletoe? A magic mistletoe. - A magic mistletoe? - Yep. No, just a mistletoe, a regular everyday mistletoe, that, again, just so happens to be very important to me and my family. Why is it so important? Well, because of its ability to spread magic everywhere it goes. That is special. So, mistletoe - can I have it back, please? I'm sure you can. Great. But I don't have it anymore. Where is it? Well, a mall Santa doesn't really have any use for a mistletoe. Yeah, true. Please tell me you didn't get rid of it. Oh, don't be silly. I gave it to a buddy of mine. Oh, not again. Oh, hold on, Santa. There you go. Thank you, Mrs Claus. So, your friend, where can we find him? He has a special Christmas tree shop on the other end of the city. I can give you the name. Yes, please. Just enter it into my phone. Smile! Oh... [CAMERA CLICKS] Wow, this is an interesting Santa photo. It's horrible. Too bad. I posted it. Oh, no, I'm not talking about that. This Christmas tree firm So? So, it's Christmas Eve Well, don't worry. We got plenty of time. Luke, you've been great and I can't thank you enough. But you don't have to come along. I mean, I know it's Christmas Eve and all. Are you crazy? I want to see this adventure to the very end. Are you sure? Helping an old friend find a magic mistletoe on Christmas Eve - hmm? Yeah, I'm sure. You know how much it irks me every time you say 'magic', don't you? I do. [CHUCKLES] Oh, and what was that wink that Mrs Claus gave Santa? I know. How awkward was that? So awkward. But what if... No, no, don't... What if Santa and Mrs Claus only started winking after Santa picked the box with the mistletoe up? That wink was not because of my family's mistletoe. How long are you gonna deny this streak for until it becomes unavoidable? It's been a long day. [PHONE RINGS] It's Elle. OK. Well, I'm gonna grab some coffee. - Do you want something? - Tea. English... English breakfast with milk and sugar. I remember from yesterday. Having a good day, huh? How could you tell? How's the hunt going for the missing mistletoe? Not great. You AND Luke? Sound like you're spending a lot of time with your old school buddy. Well, we weren't exactly buddies back in the day, but we knew each other. Either way, this photo of you two with Santa... mmm, so cute! I can't believe he posted that. Hey, if Brad can't be at your parents place for Christmas dinner, Look, I know Brad builds a lot, but he knows how important this is to me. He's gonna be there. So what are you doing tonight? Oh, just wrapping up the last of the Christmas gifts. You are going to love what I got you! Great. Yeah, you're gonna love what I got for you too. So, can we meet up tomorrow and exchange gifts? Yeah, of course. Hey, Luke is on his way back, so I'm gonna let you go. OK. Bye. Bye. BRAD: Hey. [HARPER SIGHS] What's wrong? I forget to get a Christmas present for Elle. That's OK. We'll just get it here. Last-minute shopping on Christmas Eve, and crossing town to find a Christmas tree farm? Plus I still have to go home and change for Christmas Eve dinner. I'm never gonna make it all on time. Yes, you will. I have an idea. [KEY CLICKS IN LOCK, BELL JINGLES] See? Problem solved. Private shopping with no crowded malls. Plus you get to pick any outfit you like for Christmas dinner tonight. That should save us enough time to finish our magic mistletoe mission. You're a genius.

[HARPER GIGGLES] You look... Decent? Beautiful. Thank you. But I still need to get something for Elle. One final touch. [BOTH CHUCKLE] A hat! That's it. She loves hats! [CAR HORNS] Thanks for helping me out with this crazy quest. Are you kidding me? I love quests. Seriously, it's nice not having to do this alone. Brad would never do this with me. Well, it's Christmas. I feel it's my duty to help people out. Also, when we were at the mall waiting for Santa, and I told you about my grandma... Yeah? Thanks for listening. And thanks for the new perspective. Anytime. And thank you for trusting me enough to tell me. Well, we do go way back. [LAUGHS] We do. And to be honest, I'm having fun tracking down your magic mistletoe. Me too. [CHRISTMAS MUSIC] Fake Christmas trees, huh. This guys sells fake Christmas trees at a Christmas tree stand? It's brilliant. How?! Oh, come on. Who doesn't want a real tree? The way they look, the way they make your house smell - it's all part of the Christmas experience. Well, I, for one, don't like the idea of using a real tree. Do you have any idea how bad plastic trees are for the environment? Do you know how much carbon gas is put into the air by cutting down and chipping trees every year? Now multiply that by the ten years you have one fake Christmas tree. I think I'm losing my mind here. - Losing your mind, huh? - Yep. It's cute. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you tell us about your trees here? HARPER: I don't even think they realize we're here. No. Hello! You'll have to excuse my two sales people here. They've fallen down with a bad case of puppy love, I'm afraid. - BOTH: Buddy? - That's me. Buddy of Buddy's Fake Christmas Tree stand. So, Buddy, what's going on here? Why are you selling fake Christmas trees at a Christmas tree stand? Just like your girlfriend said. BOTH: We're not together. Oh, OK. Anyways, just like the lady said, fake Christmas trees last longer and ultimately they're better for the environment. Even though they're plastic and they end up in landfills? Oh, no, not these ones here. They're all made out of completely recycled materials. - Recycled? - Uh-huh. Even better. Good for you. Just because you're getting a fake tree doesn't mean you have to miss out on the whole Christmas tree buying experience. Well, that parts nice. I did love shopping for the perfect tree with my parents. So, what type of tree are you two looking for? I can give you a great deal on these pre-lits over here. Actually, we're not looking for a tree. We're looking for a particular mistletoe. Are you... Are you sure you two aren't a couple? Look, I know it sounds funny, but my family has this 'magic' mistletoe that my friend accidentally donated, along with a box of decorations, to his thrift store. And, by chance, my aunt bought that box of decorations. And it turns out she bought it for a friend who runs a Santa booth at the Antique Mall. Mm-hm. And he said that he has no use for mistletoe and that he gave it to you. Oh. Ring any sleigh bells? I know the Santa you're talking about. He's a good guy. I was just there the other day with my kids, getting their Christmas photo shoot done and we started talking about the tree stand. Ha-ha. Yeah, that Santa really loves to chat. Yeah, well, he said he had these decorations he didn't want anymore. Asked me if I wanted them and I said sure. So, if you want to see the mistletoe, they're right back here. BOTH: Great. No, it's not here. I don't see it. Do you have anymore somewhere? Sorry, those are the only ones I have. Mine was held together with a red and green wire, almost like um... like a pipe cleaner. And it has a red bow on the bottom. Here, let me take another look. You do? Big red bow, yeah. To some guy that I've seen around the neighbourhood. He owns a bar just down the road. - Let's go. - Yeah... Wait, hold on. How long have those two been so cozy for? A few days now. You don't say. Right about the time that mistletoe showed up? Right about that time, yeah. Interesting. But, I don't know, hard to fire them at Christmas. People fall in love all the time during the holidays. Sure they do. Magic! I'll fire them after New Year's. OK, first there was Aunt Katherine running into Robert in the taxi, hm? There's no such thing as magic. And then, there was that cute little wink and smile between Santa and Mrs Claus. Probably not their real names, but... You're really going out on a limb for that one, huh. But it was cute. I think you're misusing the word 'obvious'. And then there is Buddy's fake Christmas tree stand, as strange as a concept as it was. And if by 'strange' you mean brilliant. OK, yes, two lovebirds who just happened to fall in puppy love right around the time they come into contact with said missing magic mistletoe. OK, they're kids on a break from school, spending time together. It's a pretty common way for kids to fall in love. You know what I love - how you continue to refuse to believe in the magic of your family's mistletoe, in the face of irrefutable evidence. OK, again I think you're misusing the word 'irrefutable' and 'evidence'. Not according to my law degree. Law degree? You run a thrift shop. No, actually, I started a chain of charity thrift stores to help people buy things they couldn't otherwise afford. Wait, so you're a lawyer? I used to... practise law but I don't anymore. That's crazy. That's what my mum said. And my ex-girlfriend at the time. Wait, so you gave up your career as a lawyer so that you could run a charity? Yeah. Ha. You really are full of surprises, Lucas. The name's Luke. And everybody loves surprises. We're here. Let's go. Can you see it? Not yet. [DINGING] Oh, I see it. It's over by the bar. - Yeah? - Let's go. Um... Hi! We're closed. Uh, what? Sorry. Have a good night, folks. Merry Christmas. No, wait, we... We have to come inside. I thought I made myself clear. We are closed. I don't understand. It's still early. Okay, it's Christmas Eve. People like to spend Christmas Eve with their loved ones. - Hey, he's got a point. - We're closed. Merry Christmas. Again. Um, wait, sir. My... friend has to use the restroom really, really bad. - [WHISPERING] I do? - Mm-hm. Oh, I do. Real bad. You know... [INHALING] [SIGHING] [WHISPERING] Okay, okay. Shh, shh, shh. Okay. Okay, so why'd you tell him I had to go to the washroom again? I don't know. It's all I could come up with. Look, we needed to get in, and now we're actually... We're in. So, what's the game plan here? Do we just steal this mistletoe? Oh, it's my mistletoe? Uh, no. It's actually technically not your mistletoe, - really. - Okay, listen, Mr Lawyer, we have come too far for something to go wrong. What if he doesn't wanna sell it? What do we do, then? I'm gonna go distract the bouncer. [SIGHING] - How? - I don't know. Maybe he likes meteorology. Nobody likes meteorology. - Lots of people do. - Uh, weather people, but not normal people who work at bars. Okay, are we gonna make fun of my profession, or are we gonna do this? - Hmm? - You go over there, untie the mistletoe, hide it in your jacket and then give me a signal, and we'll go. Yeah, okay. Whoa, wait. Wait. Well, what's the signal? I don't know. I got it. It's me running out of the bar as fast as I can, okay? - BOUNCER: Hey. - Whoa. Yep. - Washroom's this way. - [CLICKING FINGERS] Got it. Thank you. Be right over. - Just be cool. - Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool. - Be cool. - Yeah, yeah. - We got this. - Do we? - Yeah. - Okay. Gosh, I'm really bad at these things. [SIGHING] - Relax. - [EXHALING] Nobody's going to jail today. Yeah, no-one's going to jail. Why would anyone go to jail? Probably. [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING] Focus. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, I'm just gonna... Hi. Hello. How's it going? - It's good. - Good. - Yeah, I'm doing good too. - Great. [BELL JANGLES] So, how long have you worked here? - A while. - I... [BELL JANGLES] [SNEAKY MUSIC PLAYING] - [BELL JANGLING] - Hey. - Hey. - What in the name of Christmas do you think you're doing? What? Who, me? Why? Are you trying to steal that mistletoe? So... What mistletoe? I... The one you're trying to untie. [MOUTHING] - Oh. - Uh, Mr Bouncer, sir, - this is my fault. - What the heck is going on? Are you gonna use the bathroom or not? I didn't, but now I... now I do. I'm sorry, but this is my family's mistletoe, and it's an heirloom that I mistakenly... Well, actually, my friend Elle, she's... ...kind of quirky... And, um, right, it was donated to Luke's thrift shop, and, well, we kind of traced it back to your bar. Yep, and we're kind of like detectives. Yeah. And my sister, she thinks her boyfriend's gonna propose to her this Christmas, and as kind of a family tradition, she wants to kiss him under the mistletoe. That's a cute story and all, but I can't give you this mistletoe. You have to understand this means the world to my family. But I can't give it to you. We'd be willing to... ...buy it from you. - Absolutely. - Yeah. Nah, no? Uh... I can replace it. I've got... I've got a shelf full of mistletoes and garlands, if you want. Yeah? Wreaths. I have lovely wreaths. Oh, you should see his wreaths. They're beautiful. - Thank you. - Oh, they are. Listen, I can't let you take the mistletoe, because it's not my bar. I'm just the bouncer. You'll have to talk to my boss, the owner. You sure we can't just work something out, you know, the three of us here? My boss can get pretty weird about this kind of stuff. - Weird? - You'll see. You want that mistletoe, you have to wait till he gets here. I guess we wait. We're cutting it really close. No, no. We'll... We'll get it in time, all right? Can I offer you two a drink while you wait? - Oh, I'm driving. - Don't drink. I have hot cocoa. Sure. [CAR HORNS TOOT] [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING] So, what about you? Why haven't you gotten married yet? Well, you know how it is, finding the right person and all. Well, there must have been someone. There was... ...this amazing woman from law school. Sounds promising. What happened? [SCOFFING] I hated the hours... I worked as being a lawyer, and I... mostly the people I worked with I didn't like, so... [CHUCKLING] Yeah, I've been there. Yeah. I needed a change. I... I wanted my life to mean more than just billable hours. So that's when you started the thrift store? Yeah. Yeah, a lot of areas are really underserviced with housing prices going up and rent, average salaries staying the same. It's... getting harder and harder for most people to make ends meet. And... stores like yours make it easier for people to have a few more things they otherwise wouldn't? Yep. [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING] You're a really sweet guy. You know that? [DOOR SQUEAKING] Oh, here comes the owner. And he looks grumpy, actually. Uh, excuse me, sir. I was just wondering if we could have a moment of your time? My bouncer tells me you want my mistletoe? Well, technically, it's my mistletoe. Technically, I bought it from a fake Christmas tree stand - two days ago. - Fake Christmas tree stand? - BOTH: Don't ask. - And if it's magic, - why would I wanna sell it? - But... ...my sister, she really needs it for this evening. Listen, lady, it's the holidays. I'm really busy. No, wait. Hold on. We haven't even introduced ourselves. My name's Luke. - Okay. - I'm Harper. Wait a minute. [CHUCKLING] Meteorologist Harper Hart, Metro Channel Nine News. - Yes. - [LAUGHING] That's me, Harper Hart. I don't wanna shake your hand. BOTH: Oh. - Come on. I'm your biggest fan. - Really? Really? - Really? - Really. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Okay, I'm gonna go in for a hug. Good luck. - [BOTH LAUGHING] - Oh. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] - Funnel clouds. - Really? I saw them last week... - Look at how happy Mr West is. - LUKE: I never would've thought meteorologists have fans. You kidding? It's the only thing I've seen make him happy. The weather report. Who'd have thunk it? His wife died a few years back, so he quit his job, bought the bar and just hides in the back all day. Maybe some of that mistletoe's magic will rub off on him. Well, it's been a pretty good streak so far. Actually, has anyone here fallen in love lately? Nah, not that I know of. Hmm. - Look, Mr West... - Please call me Bobby. Bobby, thank you so much for letting me have this back. It means a lot to my family. And you? Yeah. It means a lot to me as well. Are you sure we can't pay you back? Don't even try it, bud. I'll break your hand. - I'm not trying. - I got a couple autographs, a few dozen selfies. That ought to do. Well, I'm glad that we could do something for each other. Are you kidding me? The guys in my chat room are gonna lose their minds when they hear about this. Wait, there are chat rooms for meteorologist fans? - Oh, yeah. - You got a problem with that? No, sir. No. It's a very interesting science. - I will take your word for it. - No offence, Harper, but you can do better than this yutz. He's got his good points. Trust me. Well, you must have places to go, cheer to spread? And... magic. It was a great Christmas present, meeting you. [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS] This is beautiful. [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS] Seeing as how it's Christmas Eve, I'm gonna let this one slide. - Thank you, sir. - No problem. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [MR WEST CHUCKLING] [CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS] ♪ I can't believe we actually pulled this off. Oh! [LAUGHING] Out of all the people in the city to be meteorologist fans. Yeah, there's more than you'd think. Apparently. Maybe you were right. Maybe Christmas miracles do exist. Maybe there is such a thing as a magic mistletoe. Oh, really? Now you're a believer. - No. Well, maybe. - [CHUCKLING] [BOTH CHUCKLING] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] You know what is strange, though? I was talking to the bouncer. He said no-one in the bar has fallen in love there lately. Huh. So it was all just a coincidence? - Yeah, I really thought... - Luke, I really wanna thank you - for the last couple of days. - Oh, no, Harper. I... No, really, I do. Ever since running into you at the thrift store, it's just been this crazy adventure. I love adventures. [CHUCKLING] And I couldn't have done it without you. Harper, I really wanna say something. Oh, I'm sorry. Just a second. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADING] Hey, everything okay? Um... Not exactly. [CHUCKLING] Brad - he's not coming to my Christmas dinner. He actually broke up with me. - [SCOFFING] - On Christmas Eve? Over text? 'Tis the season. - [SIGHING] Harper, I'm so sorry. - You know what? It's okay. At least we got the mistletoe. My sister's gonna be so happy. - Yeah. - [BELL JANGLES] But didn't you... didn't you s... ...say at the Christmas tree stand that your mistletoe is held together by green and red wires? Yeah, and a red ribbon. Well, this one, uh... This one just has a black wire. Here. - Hmm? - Oh, no. - Harper, uh... - It's the wrong mistletoe. The fake Christmas tree guy, he must have sold it to someone else. Look, it's not too far from here. And it's Christmas Eve. Maybe... Maybe it's still open. - No. - If we run there, we can ask him if he sold it to somebody else, right? No, Luke. It's over. Okay, it might not have even really started anyways. What? [DOWNBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] This whole thing has just been a waste of time. You know, you even had me convinced for a moment that maybe, maybe there was such a thing as magic. Oh, well, don't say that. You just told me how much fun you were having. Yeah, well, the adventure's over, and Christmas got me again. Just hope this is close enough to fool my sister. - No, don't do that. - Oh, that old plant never had any magic, and neither does this one. He's a great guy. They're gonna have a great marriage, regardless of what mistletoe they kiss under tonight. We can just look a little harder, okay? No, I'm done looking. And I'm done with whatever this was. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] And I'm definitely done with Christmas. Harper. No, please, Luke. I just wanna be alone. Nobody wants to be alone on Christmas. [DOWNBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I do. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] Let her, boy. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] No, no, no, no. [GASPING] Come on. - [KEY CLICKING] - Come on. [SIGHING] Why won't anyone believe me when I say I hate this holiday. [SIGHING] [MISTLETOE JANGLES] [UPLIFTING MUSIC] I told you. You'd better watch out, or you're going to end up on the naughty list. Not in the mood. Looks like you found your mistletoe. Yeah. Well, no. It's a mistletoe, but it's not the right one. Well, that's too bad. I was hoping you would find it. A magic mistletoe is a rare thing. Why do we keep running into each other? - It's a small city. - No, it's not, actually. Well, it's a small world, then. Is this all just an elaborate joke? What do you mean? Never mind. Wait. Is this just some weird Christmas present that my family has put together, to get me to fall in love with Christmas? Oh, why would searching all over the city for a missing mistletoe make you fall in love with Christmas again? I don't know. Maybe... ...making me spend time with an amazing guy who loves Christmas, and maybe I'll see the holidays through his eyes. You think your family has that kind of power? I don't even have that kind of power. What's his name? Luke. And what did you and Luke end up doing together? We went to his aunt's house. - Mm-hm. - And she'd just fallen in love. And she was really happy to see her nephew twice in one week. Family is an important part of the holidays. What next? - And then we saw you,... - Mm. ...and Ms Claus made us wait in line to get a photo with you. A photo with a mall Santa - something cherished by parents and families for a lifetime. And then I had to get a present for Elle. Shopping on Christmas Eve? Sorry, kid. That must have been awful. No, it wasn't, actually. Luke made it fun. Actually, he made the entire time fun. And then we saw your friend at the fake Christmas tree stand. My buddy, Buddy! Pretty neat concept, huh? And then, at the bar, Mr West was just so happy to talk about weather. Isn't that a great feeling? Making people happy, maybe fulfilling somebody else's Christmas wish. - Mm. - You think, maybe, that's what Luke was doing? [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] I just... yelled at an amazing man who has done nothing but dedicate the last two days to... - ...helping me find this. - Seems like a nice kid. Although he did seem a little happy to see me at the mall. I mean, for a grown man, and all. Yeah, he really does love Christmas. Maybe it's contagious. I have to go. I have so much to do before this night is over. - Me too. - Oh, I need a taxi. I'll handle it. [CAR APPROACHING] What? How? Merry Christmas, Harper. Merry Christmas, Santa. [UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] Where to, miss? Robert? Hey, it's you. Did you and Luke find the magic mistletoe? No, we didn't. But that's okay, because I think Santa pointed out I may have found something much, much better. - Santa? - Yeah, he's right over... He was there just a minute ago. Well, it's Christmas Eve. I'm sure he had places to be. [CHUCKLING] So, where to? I have to go to the suburbs. Can you get me there fast?
