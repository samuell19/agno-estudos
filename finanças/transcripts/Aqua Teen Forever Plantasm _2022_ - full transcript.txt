[ Beeping ] [ Dog barks ] [ Beeping ] Carl: Oh, my stomach hurts. I feel like I got gas or something. No! No! This ain't gas! W-W-What's happening to me?! [ Growls, screeches ] Who wants to party?! [ Laughs ] Carl looks like he needs a hug. Meatwad, that's not Carl. It's John Carpenter's "The Thingamajig." And if you hug it, it will hug you back until you are dead. Woman: Commence self-destruct mode in T-minus 30 seconds. Get in your suits! Hurry! But, Shake, what about you? Just get your ass in that Escape Cup. I'm never gonna get laid again! I don't need no instructions to know how to ride! Look at my freaking body! I brought enough lasers for everybody. Oh, that don't matter. None of this matters. Yeah! Aah! [ Laughs evilly ] Come here! Ahh! Damn it! He's got me. Lay off the French fries, Fat Stuff! What, ya... What, ya steppin' to me? I know you wasn't talking to me. [ Screaming ] Let's do this! Yeah! Maybe you need to lose some weight, Carl... in the head region. [ Grunting ] Where did Carl go? And all his... Were those his cousins? Carl was never an official Aqua Teen, just a try-hard wannabe. But us, we're O.G. Aqua Teen Forever. Shake's right, Meatwad. We stick together always. Buckle up, gang. T-minus 20 seconds. But there's only room for two in here. 20... 19... This was always a one-way trip for me. ...18, 17... Shake, no! We can fit you in the cupholder. ...16, 15... I thought we was gonna be together. ...14, 13... [ Sniffles ] Aqua Teen Forever. Nothing lasts forever. ...12, 11... Initiate the launch. Sayonara, guys. Say hi to Earth for me. ...10, 9, 8... We'll never forget you, Shake. ...7... And when you get down there, tell my wife I love her. ...6, 5... Okay, man. We gotta go. Push the launch button, please. ...4, 3... And I want you to give that big blue marble... ...2... ...a little kiss for me. ...1... Push the damn button or... Shake: And now I'm homeless. Can you believe how this country treats our space heroes? So you survived when the ship self-destructed? I'm standing here, aren't I? What part of time travel do you not understand? Where's the rest of your Aqua Teens? I said they're dead, even though I did fight valiantly to save them. That's how heroic I am. Saving dicks who don't even appreciate me. They exist only on this tattoo, which I'm getting changed to say "Aqua Teen Never" because that's cheaper than getting it removed. Why Aqua Teen? You seem way older than a teenage... I'm well into my late 40s. What is this? A press conference?

You're three minutes in, and the Mooninites have already hijacked your movie. And if you ever want to see your movie alive again, bitch, you will text ERRIZDAMAN to ERRULZ (377859). Errulz? What gibberish is this? It's my agenda. It's not even spelled right. Err does rule. You didn't think to ask me before you made "ERRULZ" our ransom text line? Man, I must have been so drunk when I did it. Text "ERRIZDAMAN"... one word... And then check your phone. Whoops! And now we've hijacked your phone. Ha ha ha! That's right. We dominate both your screens. We are everywhere at once! The Mooninites control all your wireless devices, including your remote control... Don't touch it. ...which we control remotely... I said, don't touch it! ...with a separate remote control. We're digital. And we have one more digit for you. Drop to your knees and feast upon it. 'Cause this is your food. Let it nourish you. What else can we say to offend, Err? I don't know, man. Kind of running out of stuff. We're going to come up with some other wicked barbs to berate you with, but until then, choke on your pathetic excuse for entertainment. You just wasted $3. No, it's $19.99. What? For this? Robbery! No, this is nothing but a pathetic cash grab. Theaters rejected it. Yah! Whoo! Yah! Whoa, Billy! Whoa, Jenny! Whoa, Bobby! Turn right, Lucy. Turn right, Billy. Turn right, Other Bobby. [ Laughs ] Okay, don't everybody love on me at once. Meatwad, we don't need any more dogs. Ouch, Billy. Ouch, Bobby. Ouch, Other Bobby. Now, that hurts. We're running out of space. And judging by some of these tags, did you steal these dogs from dog owners? I just love me some dogs. My emotions run very high when I see them. And, well, it often clouds my judgment. Yeah, they love you, too, but in a different way. Ow! Down, boy! I'm getting in good shape working here. [ Dog barks ] I lost 20 pounds just last week. Ouch! Down! Liz, you should go home and take a load off. Give them dogs a rest. I'm talking about your feetsies, now. You lock up every night, Meatwad. I feel bad asking this, but you're not living here, are you? [ Chuckles ] No! Lord, no. Oh, good. This is an animal shelter, Liz. I'm a man. Come on, now. Here are the keys. Oh! I feel so guilty making you lock up again. Guilty enough that, uh, maybe I crash with you for a few weeks at your apartment, with the food and all? No, no. [ Laughs ] Not that kind of guilt. The kind of guilt where you say it but you don't mean it or feel it. Why do you ask? [ Scoffs ] No reason whatsoever. I got me a big house to live in. Two cool roommates, too. You've seen my tattoo. Aqua Teen Forever, baby. Frylock, Master Shake. These here are my homeboys. [ Chuckles ] Listen to me prattle on. [ Door closes ] [ Dogs barking ] See ya later. [ Siren wailing, cans clanking, gunshots ] [ Insect squeaking ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Beep ] [ Rattling, popping ] [ Water running ] We got goblins? Huge ones. You haven't heard them? Shake, ain't no goddamn goblins in here, man. And now you curse in front of him. Is it any wonder why Meatwad's so [bleep] up? You ass[bleep] asshole. [ Sighs ] Ugh. [ Chuckles ] "Dongle." Where's my computer? I sold it. Had to buy the Halloween costumes. Boo. I'm Macaroni Man. Okay, his is not the good one. I had the cure for cancer on that hard drive, Shake. But when I win, we use the money to buy your computer back. 'Course, I got to split the winnings with these other guys. Yeah. Nice! Big man. [ Subway tracks clacking ] [ Snoring ] Unh-unh, unh-unh. Meatwad, let go. But who's gonna feed me and help me say my prayers and tuck me in at night? You got to let go of me, please. Frylock, you're not leaving. I'm the leader and I'm telling you, you're not going anywhere. Yeah, walk it off. You'll be back... by... by the end of the month to pay the bills, right? Or I'll get evicted, and... And that is not happening, son! You think he heard any of that? Boo! Macaroni Man. Still can't believe you won that contest. [ Brakes squealing ] Next stop, Amazin' headquarters, your one shop for online shopping. When you go to work here, you'll say, "It's Amazin'." ♪♪ I soldered all those motherboards, installed all the spyware. Tickets are all clear. Already? Damn, dude! Hey, we get paid by the hour. You've got to move slower. They'll expect all of us to be that fast. [ Computer beeps ] Ooh! New ticket. "Mouse needs new batteries"? Oh, man. There you go. Go crush that one, superstar. It's up in the Llama Dolly? [ Slurping ] I've never been in there. Worked here eight years, never set foot in the Llama Dolly. They say it's a functional spaceship and everyone who built it had their minds erased. The elevator only has one button... up. [ Elevator bell dings ] No one comes down. No one. You heard of Neil? He lives in there. Shake: Llama Dolly? Why don't they just call it the Dalai Lama? She-shay-shush! Never call it that. He named it that because he did not want to insult his best friend, His Holiness. He's friends with the Dalai Lama? Don't say that! There's microphones everywhere. And whatever you do, don't say anything about his, you know. About his what? There's a rumor [chuckles] we, of course, do not believe... Right? that he's 4 inches tall. You sure you're up for this, Phoenix? [ Chuckles ] I lived with an asshole for 15 years, man. I think I can handle Neil. Oh! We didn't say he was an asshole, just that he's small and he lives in a spaceship disguised as an animal. Geez, some hang-ups there, Phoenix. Is that a really real name? Phoenix? Like the bird that arose from the ashes? No, like the capital of Arizona. What do you think? Okay, okay. Everyone give Phoenix some space, 'cause that's definitely his real name. Dude, for what it's worth, I do think it's a cool name. [ Clanging, beeping, pounding ] [ Spray-paint can hissing ] Carl: Warriors! [ Chuckles ] Come out and play-ay! [ Laughs ] That's right. I'm the Bloods and the Crips all in one can. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Boo! Ah, damn it! Where'd you come from? The roof. I thought you vampires got to be invited in. Not when you own the place. Who invited you in? It's condemned. I-I come in here to chase off, uh, rival street gangs. Oh. They just spray-painted this and run off. "Animal magnetizm." "Scorpians ruuulez" spelled wrong. I guess kids today still like quality East German metal from the '80s. But this house is an eyesore, Markula. It's dragging down my property values. Tell you what. I'm gonna make you a generous offer, take this off your hands. So you can flip it? I wasn't born yesterday. I was born 40,000 years ago. Okay. All right. You got me. I'm old now, too. Slap a coat of paint on this, and you're gonna be so friggin' rich, dude. Amazin's gobbling up everything in the neighborhood. Yes! Yeah, boy! [ Laughing ] Yeeeeah! B-B-Boy-boy-boy-ba-boy! You remember them food freaks living there? Oh, yes. So many times I was like, "I'm out. I'm done. And I rented to them just to annoy you. All that time being pissed off. That's why I'm bald... Not genetics, the anger. Hanging out with them, it took years off my life. So did the asbestos, probably. I never took it out like the city told me. [ Both laugh ] Living here is finally gonna to pay off, brother. For once in my life, happiness. Hooray! True, genuine happiness! Jeff: Come on, baby. Stretch it harder, Neil. Ooh, you're growing taller. I can see it. I can see you growing. It's miraculous. Come on, crank it up, Neil. Elongate yourself, Neil. Come on, we're in that homestretch. Get it? 'Cause we're stretching. Hello? Someone call about mouse batteries? Quick, grab that pen and tape measure and meet me at the door frame, quickly, quickly, now! I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Mark it. Mark it before I shrink. Uh, you want me to put a date? Yeah. It's pretty much the same as last month and the month before. Impossible. Let me see. You marked from the crown of my head? Yeah. I knew it wasn't working, Elmer! Blip-Blop, new door frame now. You, fix this machine. It's not working. That's why I called you. Not mouse batteries. Okay? I'm not an idiot. Would an idiot be able to build this company? This is what a smart person does. [ Clattering ] Now I definitely can't fix it. Do not speak a word about this. Blip-Blop, pull up an NDA. Here, sign this. You will go to jail if you say anything about my size, which is perfect for a man of my height. You're not that small. I mean, I was told you were... 4 inches tall? Elon Musk spread that rumor. He's nothing but a battery pimp who likes to have sex with his batteries. Tell that to everyone you know. Let's get that going. Blip-Blop, new machine now. Do not drop it. Do not drop it. D'oh! Hum! Find my center. Hum! Breathe into my body, out, release. [ Breathes deeply ] Hum! Okay. Ha ha. Sorry. It's been a rough morning. I'm usually way taller than this. I'm Neil. Phoenix. You ain't gonna get taller strapping yourself to a rack. But you could clone yourself and splice the DNA with a taller protein. Like steak? No, I'm vegan. I don't eat steak. Are you aware that the beef industry is responsible for over 30% if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? Or is it carbon monoxide? Blip-Blop, which is the bad one? No, not at all like steak. Oh. Great. I mean, of course, it's a very complicated process. To clone me? Sure. But two Neils. I like it. Do it, now. Blip-Blop, make him do it now. Sorry. I don't understand. Aah! DNA. You were talking. I rudely interrupted. Go! Look, it's risky. I've done it before, but I've never quite got the sequencing right... [ Echoing ] Sequencing right. Sequencing right. Sequencing right. [ Beeping ] Whoa! Damn! It worked. Yes! Ignore me now, women. Toss me the rock. Wait a minute. I'm the ball? What you say goes unheard. Why didn't everybody just buy a ball? I call upon the power of Gray skull... Don't do this. ...to dunk on Meatwad's ass. Please don't do this. Vanilla Wonder! Oh, this sucks. [ Slurp ] Aah! Oh! Shit, man, I got the splice wrong. [ Chuckling ] Whoa! Look at your leg, dude. That is graphic and funny. Foul! Charging on Carl! Huge, huge side effects. I need more research, more experiments. But, in theory, it should work. Well, maybe we can make that happen. You down in I.T., rotting away? Been there a few months, been crushing it, if I say so myself. Well, now you're up here with me, making me taller. Let me show you the operation. This is it, the Llama Dolly. The Llama-dama-ding-dong! It's my bitching house and nothing more, regardless of what anyone or Elon Musk says. Well, you know, down in I.T., they said it might be, uh... ...you know... spaceship. Spaceship? That's a boldface lie. Who told you that? What are their names? Oh, I don't remember. I just heard it around the coffee machine. Well, that could narrow it down, because not everybody drinks coffee. Blip-Blop, establish cross-referencing database of everyone who works in I.T. with everyone who drinks coffee. You're talking to your hand, Neil. I mean, you threw your phone. Remember? [ Laughs ] Wow! Talking back on day one. You have your own opinions. You're not afraid to speak your mind. I like it. But what I say into my hand is none of your business. Sorry, man. Won't happen again. No, it will not. Scratch that database. This is my hand, as we both know. Hanging up now. And here's my fulfillment center, run entirely by Fraptackulans and Japangaloids. They traveled the galaxy for the opportunity to work here. I thought those two races hated each other. They're mortal enemies, but at Amazin', we're all one big happy family, right, guys? If I slip on your Japangaloid slime one more time, I'm speaking to your supervisor. Ha ha! I am the supervisor, Crap-tackulan. It is "Fraptackulan" with an "F," not "Craptackulan" with a "C." And you know that. How's that feel? You wanna go?! You like that, crap-man?! There they go again. Blip-Blop, release the sub-mist. Weird. The hand works. Wow. I'm so sorry, man. Oh, no. Your skin came off when I hugged you. It's cool. I molt like three times a day. All good. No worries. Is that sub-mist legal? Sure smells good. It's like Xanax, but it's free. People take that. Is that legal? So many questions. My hiding machine... in pieces! It's ruined! And this is Elmer, my head of R&D, Elmer is the gaping asshole who thought that machine was gonna make me taller, instead of making me madder. Sentient French-fried potatoes? You're floating. How? Whoa! Okay, okay. Easy, now, man. Is this jewel decorative or does it serve practical purposes? Okay. Down, boy. [ Laughs ] Elmer's pretty bright, just not socially stable. Don't you agree, Elmer, that you're sweaty? What is this? Oh, that's peanut oil. Of course. Aah! Sorry, man. I-I said back off. Light amplified by stimulated emissions of radiation? We all know what a laser is, Elmer. Martin Landau shot them frequently on the moon base in "Space: 1999." What are you growing there? Walk vines. Come to me. Vines? Show these men what I've been working on. Why won't you come to me? I'm a friend. You can open up to me. Yeah, he's trying to teach the vines to respond to verbal commands. I'll start. How is your day going? But it ain't happening, is it, Elmer? They're being passive-aggressive. They refuse to learn. And they're just plants, though. Bad vines! Listen, Elmer, I have to cancel dinner tonight. Something came up. Phoenix, what do you have going on tonight for dinner? Elmer just canceled. You said something came up. Yeah, that's what I told you. I'm telling my new friend something else, Elmer. I suppose I'm free tonight. Dinner, me, you, my house, the Llama-dama-ding-dong! Tonight, it's going down! You'll eat with me, won't you, my seedlings? I've prepared a hot meal, a fertilizer feast. What do you mean, "Did this come out of your butt?" Of course it came from my butt. You know, you liked it yesterday, so I'm not sure what the big kick is here. And now for a little me time. Ooh! There we go. [ Zipper opens ] There she is. Mm! That's right, baby. I'm looking at you. Carl! Damn it! My brother from another mother! Long time, no see! Hey, what are you doing with your penis there? You're gonna break it if you keep doing that. Don't look over there. Just push through. Wow! Did they not mention the pool? That's got to be worth another 4 or 5K. He's right. I said Olympic-sized pool, and it ain't on here. Getting soft here! The moment's passed! I see you're still rockin' them sweats. Neighborhood's looking great, by the way. I told you me living here would create value. Oh, yeah, good call. I'll meet you at the door. [ Doorbell ringing rapidly ] What? Bring it in, Carlito's Way. Oh, you reek. No, no, no. We're not hugging here. Make it quick, and then I'm calling the cops. Oh, whoa. That is hurtful. I just wanted to check in and see how you're doing. You know. No. And I don't feel comfortable under that bridge. No. Get your foot out of there. No! No! Get... Okay, look, before you say no, all I need is the three S's... Shower, shit, and a sundae with hot fudge. Don't you feel this, bro? Mmm! With me here, it's a hang. Alright, let's cut to the chase. You want to crash here for free? Just a few months, Carl. It's so tough out there for guys like me who don't want to have anything to do with work. Don't... Don't cry here. I know we got shared history here. I ain't forgotten. I can probably make one room available to you. It's a real cozy starter home. Bigger than it looks, too. And look at that, huh? It's got new windows put in. So, we gonna just put it right in the living room or...? No, no, no. We'll keep it back here where no one from the road can see you. And don't you even look at that pool. And where am I going to shave? Hey, this is what I'm offering. If you don't like it, you live with the Fry man. [ Ominous music plays ] Frylock is dead to me. I'll never speak with him again, but I might want to troll him via text, so I'd need his new cell number. Do you have it? What up, Neil? No, that sucks. Hey, Neil. I-I made my famous strawberry shortcake. Short. Damn it. He'll think I'm making fun of him. Stupid! Why didn't I just bring wine? Nice jewel, French fry. It'd look a lot nicer around my neck. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. See you later. [ Doorbell buzzing ] It ain't a compliment. I want it. Yeah, hash brown. Neil, Neil, come on. Open the door. Neil! Help. Help! Get your ass over here. [ Laughs ] Stab, stab by, stab. There it is. Hyah! Get out of here, street toughs! Phoenix, no! Oh, come on. Come on. Frickin' lotionless. [ Shudders ] ♪♪ Aw, man. I bet it's cold out there. [ Sighs ] Damn it. [ Laughs ] Fire! Fire! Fire! Stop, drop, and roll! I'm like if the Impractical Jokers had balls. What kind of joke is that? Good one, Carl. [ Gasps ] What happened? It's okay. You're okay, Phoenix. Don't get up. Cut, clarity, color. The geometry is perfect. My jewel. No, no. It shouldn't be detached. I need that back. Who would do this? We're investigating. They left a clue. Strawberry shortcake. They obviously came to make fun of me. Is that my box? It's ripped to shreds! I'm disfigured! [ Crying ] Oh, my God. Look, I know this was traumatic, but I have creepy Elmer working on this and all of the resources of my incredible company. Soon, you'll be a Phoenix rising from the ashes. And not just that hot, dry city in Arizona. Uh, no, thanks. I don't need to go right now, man. It's not a bedpan. It's your new box that Neil made me make for you. It's made of brotanium, the lightest-yet-strongest material known to man. Look it up. It's stronger than anything in the MCU, even stronger than vibranium, which we're allowed to say but not show. Damn! For real? It's devised by Elmer but named by me, because Elmernesium is a dumb name. Don't we agree on that? Yep. You're right 'cause you're the boss and everything. I, like, suck. Here, let's see if it fits around your brains. Hell yeah! [ Bird screeches ] [ Sniffs ] I got these pits smelling lemony-citrus and dishwasher-safe. And now, time to activate the gravy. Oh. Yeah. Mmm! Mmm! [ Dogs barking ] Fish and egg and cheddar? Whoda thunk they'd go well together? I'll tell you who. The dogs here. Uh-oh. Oh, hey, Liz! So you are sleeping here. I'm not sleeping here during the day. Come on, girl. Just at nighttime. I'm sorry, Meatwad. We're a charity, but our charity only extends so far. How far? Aah! Ugh! That's pretty far. You got you a good arm, Liz. Good luck, Meatwad! Please do not come back! I'm adding a really cool bonus room, Carl. Hey, maybe I'll invite you over for some air hockey later. Yeah. No, thanks. Meat man. What's up? Hey, Carl. How you doing? He's doing fine. Can I help you? I was talking to Carl. And now you're talking to me. And I'm here to tell you there is no room at the inn, so just roll along, now. Bye-bye. Shake, come on, man. Relax. We'll break ground on another condo. You mean it, a place of my very own? Just got another house in the mail. Look, at this. 12 bedrooms. Wow. Or you knock down these walls, opens up the whole flow. Damn, Carl, you're a real prince. Something's different with you, man. I ain't never seen you so not pissed off at the world. You noticed that? I used to sleep with my hands balled in fists of rage. My knuckles were sore from my angry dreams... because I lived next to you. And now I got a better outlook on life, 'cause I'm about to get paid, son. [ Laughs ] ♪♪ That's our old house, ain't it? Yeah, that's where I barely let you live. Who's ordering stuff over here? Yeah, and laying those boxes down in perfect rows. Like so many ears of corn. Yeah, I already went through them. They're all pretty empty. You grab what you want. But these ain't addressed to you. And, yet, I received them. Alright, look, here at Carl Acres, taxes are pretty high. And they're assessed weekly... cash. [ Laughs ] A property tax? I took to the road so I didn't have to deal with such responsibilities. Look, I don't know what to tell you. Home ownership is a very important part of owning a home. I hear that. Now, if you're gonna live here, you're gonna follow my rules and you're gonna earn. Okay, the sauna detoxifies, and the ice bath freezes the toxins. Whoo, it's cold! Give me one more. I'm not helping. You got this. [ Grunts ] Whoo! Hey, down low. Oh, okay. Now back to the sauna, but only for a second, then the ice bath again, and then the sauna again. Are we allowed to use soap or...? Yes, but the soap is infused with scorpions. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you... I don't remember. Quickly, bathe like I do. I look crazy, man. See? The crazier you look, the smarter Wall Street thinks you are. Ow. Ow, ow. The venom glands of the scorpion, they release toxins. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah. And do you know what that means? Back to the sauna? Yes. To detoxify. You're learning, Phoenix. Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Yeah. It's my private discotheque. I don't even know why I own it. You're the first person I've ever allowed to dance in here. You're pretty good. You're a good dancer, too, Neil. [ Roars ] Albino Bengal tiger. There's only eight of them in the civilized world. And now there's seven. Whoa! Neil, what the fuck?! Uh, I'm sorry. Why did you do that? Did you not think that was cool, me showcasing my power? Hell, no, that's not cool, man. Oh, I am so sorry, Phoenix. Please forgive me. I never valued anyone's opinion before because mine were so great. I'm just feeling this vibe with us, man. It's okay, Neil. It makes me crazy. I'm feeling the vibe, too. But what about your tiger? Should we help your tiger now? I don't know. What do you think? See? I asked your opinion. No more tiger shooting because of what you said. My friend. Wait. Hold on. [ Muffled shouting ] [ Beeping ] [ Steam hisses ] Yes. It's stable. It's holding. Uh, my ankle's weakening! [ Cracking ] [ Laughs ] Wrong again. So sorry, Neil. We're close. I know it. Hey, get back to the warehouse and work. But how? I don't know, but those boxes don't deliver themselves. [ Groans ] Not yet anyway. [ Laughs ] Elmer! Never open your mouth unless you have something smart to say! Only Phoenix is the smart one! Guess I don't know what I'm talking about, even though I constantly know what I'm talking about. Neil, I just want to thank you, man, for putting your faith in me. For the first time in my life, I feel valued, respected, actually liked. I feel like I have a friend. You do have a friend, Phoenix. An amazin' friend. [ Squeaking ] Here at Amazin', we have amazin' products, amazin' deliveries, amazin' employees, and amazin' employee bathrooms. Whoa! Was that Frylock? And despite what the media says, no one is forced to urinate in a bottle unless they want to, which they can because it's their God-given right, and we support that. Right, Llama Dolly? [ Ding ] When you get your Amazin' shipment, you'll say... All: It's Amazin'! Dorks. And that's where we're working tonight, earning your keep. I hear it's fun over there. I miss being part of a team. Y'all remember Aqua Teen? No, we ain't working for that Neil bloodsucker. Half his employees are on food stamps, pissing in bottles. Yeah, my cousin's a teamster, told me all about it. And he's hiring us to visit with Amazin' employees and show them the benefits of being in a union. Yeah! [ Laughs ] Carl, what are you doing? Smashing a window. [ Laughs ] And then we put these pro-union leaflets inside the smashed windows? Oh, yeah, yeah. We're like influencers. And this pipe is our social media. Sorry about your tire. Join a union. [ Grunts ] Did we already do this one? Oh, are you kidding me? Someone double-booked the event? Look at this. They missed the taillights. Amateurs. Please don't, sir, okay? Those gentleman over there already spoke to me about not joining the union. Okay, fine! I like my shitty wages! Goons hired by the company. No, we're goons hired to show you the benefits of joining a union so actions like this would stop. Would the union give us enough money to find a decent place to live that isn't a car? You ain't got nowheres to live? Friends, we did not come here by choice. Many moltons ago, our home planet of Japan go was a paradise, until Neil arrived. He offered us good jobs on Earth with low pay and zero benefits. Well, that certainly didn't add up. Want to set your own hours and make six figures working from home? Of course you don't. You're too lazy to want success. Come work for me, where I dictate the terms. Of course we refused him. So he pushed our planet closer to our sun, cackling as our crops burned and our slime reservoirs evaporated. So come on, gang, who wants to be part of the Amazin' success story? You do. So let's roll up our sleeves and get down to business, or you're dead. We will never surrender to you, Neil. And then he released the sub-mist. Sounds like a plan, Neil. When do we start? We boarded the Llama Dolly en masse after paying Neil's ridiculous moving charges and resettlement fees. The whole trip to Earth was a blur. And now we're wedged in a warehouse, elbow-to-elbow with Craptackulans Not to be racist, but they're the shittiest race in space. Oh, go blow it out your bing-bong hole! The bing-bong hole is not for waste. It's a pleasure center and nutrient port. I wouldn't touch you with his moisture prongs. Keep molting all over the parking lot.

You got to get over your differences and work together here. Union can get you good wages, medical care for whatever that is making your skin come off in big hunks and making you...

He works in the Llama Dolly. He's the one who maimed me. And he's good friends with that asshole Neil. He calls himself Phoenix now? [ Laughs ] What kind of name is Phoenix? Call him Franklin French Frylock. That's his Christian name. Call him that. Oh, he hates it. Of course Frylock's an asshole. I lived with the man for 15 years. He took care of everything. Then he didn't give me an ounce of credit. Yeah, well, the Frylock I know cares about people. No, he doesn't. He's not like Carl. Carl gave us homes, dignity, a place to hang our hats. Right, Carl? Whoa, you ain't coming in here. No, I know that. I have a house of my own, thanks to you. And you need to relocate it because I don't want the grass getting brown underneath. I'm watering tonight.

Gone-a-wrong-a-tong. Oh, do you want to resume watching without the crucial information we destroyed right in front of your face? Dumbass. You won't understand. You may as well be watching "Tenet."

Them plants chased us all the way to Berlin, Reykjavik, and frickin' Venice, Italy. But why? And that key that the spy gave us, who we ended up finding dead in your hotel room. How does it all connect? You got to admit, though, that was a pretty exciting chase. Yeah, it was. Where did those frickin' plants come from? Why do you think I would know? Frylock's the one who does the science stuff. You want me to text him? He gave you his number?! When I asked, he gave me the finger. We're back. You're welcome. That's right, stupid viewer. We deleted this next scene, too. Forever. You'll never see it 'cause it's gone. It sucked so hard that I think we should have made them watch it. Yes, it is a slow scene. They take in some Renaissance art and fly back home in real time. It really added nothing productive to the story. Yeah, it's like watching "The Irishman" on a loop, man. Well, someone is a film buff. Got a problem with that? The onion peels. So what? I like movies. Well, it's just... it's just very hard to disrupt the movie when you want to constantly watch it, Err. You can see how the optics are bad. Yeah, I know. We should work together here. Okay. Being assholes to the viewer, not to each other. I'm not debating you. Let's just watch the movie. Press "play." We really need to get out of here sometime tonight. Computer, play the movie. Moment of truth, Neil. Ready to do this? Are the ankles gonna perform like overcooked pasta noodles?
