TO NEW SHORES Based on the novel "Zu neuen Ufern" by Lovis H. Lorenz Left side, Pudding, left side! If you keep playing that slow, this game will never end. Ah... missed again! Go mark your points. I told you, left side! I thought you wanted to trick me again. Dear Pudding, you will never become a gentleman. Stop calling me Pudding all the time! Funny how do your Sixes... from the bottom up? - I think it's elegant. - Elegant? Lord Wilson does them in the same manner. Bravo! After all, one day you will be man of culture! Excellent. You come off with the most audacious moves. I have the feeling, I'm about to win a fortune from you today. This is my last game. Too much bad luck today. But, my dear pudding, I cannot quit the game when I'm winning! But I can, when I'm losing. So my whole education is useless! - I'm no millionaire. - But your father. He sells his cheese far too expensive anyway! My father does not trade with cheese on a small, but on a grand scale! But with cheese! Give me the chalk! I may not be the son of Lord Pembrook, even so, the Wells are very honorable people, hard-working - and economizing, - ...cheese-paring! and so acquired a fortune! And you, my dear Pudding, squander it with dubious aristocrats like me. A state that tolerates that kind of things is doomed! Not only in nobility circles one encounters these immoral excesses, no, even the sons of England's middle classes are infected by that spirit of immorality! Facts! Evidence! Evidence? Just one example, of what is tolerated in the year of the Lord 1846: At the Adelphi Theatre a singer is performing, her name is... what's her name... Gloria Vane! Not only does she sing the most impudent songs, no, she's also dressed with... With what? My tongue almost refuses to pronounce it: Almost nothing! - Where's she performing? - Adelphi Theatre! And the future of our families, the young men who one day want to be called the pride of England, it's not that they would hiss and boo that harlot, no, they applaud her! They cheer her! They call me Miss Vane, the famous, the well-known, yes, Sir! The not very popular with aunts and uncles, no, Sir! They fear that I might meet their sheltered nephews in a gambling casino or a canopy bed, that I could seduce them with a thousand tricks, into something that they might not know yet, yes, Sir! That's how I am all over, and that's how I will stay. Yes, Sir! Really... outrageous! A swamp! Scandal! Now what do you want, down there? I say this is a scandal, up there! A swamp! - Go on! - Don't bother about them! Rubbish! It's great! Intolerable! Now what exactly do you dislike, my dear? What I don't like... this is a shamelessness, a... Swamp! No one invited you. We would do very well without you. Bravo Albert! Well said! Bravo! Go on! Florist! A bouquet of camellias for Miss Vane! But my dear Pudding, camellias are out of fashion! Only pale lilac heliotropes come into question this season. - Helio... - ...tropes. Do you know what this is, up there? A crime! There's only one crime, and that is Ignorance, and only one virtue: Beauty. Who are you, anyway? The author of this little ditty that you find so offensive. That's just like you! Thank God! If it were like you, it would certainly be awful! Let's go! This is a... Swamp. Madam - I lay the admiration of the whole audience at your feet. Second verse, please. Just as I stand here, that's how I am - yes Sir! My beauty is not given for nothing to me - no, Sir! The thousands of rumoured risque little tales, the quietly whispered amorous stories are imputed to me only partially, for even a bad reputation obliges! Yes, Sir! That's how I am all over, and that's how I will stay. Yes, Sir! Scandalous! She wears almost nothing! Swamp! Opera glasses, Sir? And when I once must end my earthly guest appearance, yes, Sir... Thou shalt not turn away from me indifferently, no, Sir! I have loved, and I have kissed, because that is what love was invented for, just as all here do it for thousands of years, it's just that, for God's sake, no one must get to know it - no, Sir! Excuse me - just a moment, Mr Finsbury! We have heard you want to leave our beautiful England? Yes, much to our regret! Gentlemen, what's keeping me here? What's... you seem to forget that you still have some debts to us. Only 615 pounds, altogether. Well... I will transfer it to you from Australia. A moment. Couldn't you settle this little trifle before your departure? Otherwise, the whole voyage could possibly be endangered. Come to the ship tomorrow... then you will get your money. Well - hopefully. After the show you all come to me - to celebrate Albert's farewell! - Of course, darling! So children, come in! Make yourself at home. Ah, it's nice here! Take off your coats, chop-chop, quick! The rum bowl to the fire, no thank you, I'll do it myself. Have you got that sugar loaf? Mademoiselle, please take the pillow. Nicely soft, Violet, isn't it? How should I know? We're going to brew a brandy punch. Always one thing at a time, Sir! Now what to say of Albert, going to Australia, to the colonies... The most elegant man in London... I don't understand it! What don't you understand? Ah, there you are! I mean, that you will leave us, and that you allow this, Madam. By the way, you were once again magnificent tonight. "They call me Miss Vane, the famous, the well-known, yes Sir!" Oh, sorry, of course I can't do it as good as you. Pudding, I have to talk to you for a moment, alone. Yes... Jimmy, don't forget the sugar loaf, we're... What is it? Do you know what Gloria just said? We're an entirely corrupt society. The English society, my dear Gloria, resembles a haunch of venison. It is only relishable if it has a small haut gout. Now don't be so difficult. If I cannot pay my debts, they will not let me go. Then my future is ruined. I don't have that much with me. Of course not. But there's cheques. You've got credit. All right. How much? 615 pounds. Should be a bagatelle for you. That's pretty! Here you are! Thank you. What's that supposed to mean? That's just 15 pounds! Now you should have seen your startled face! Stop the silliness. Add a 6 and it's all right. Oh, how the great Albert suddenly can ask so nicely! First you have to tell me what you need the money for. A girl, huh? Bloody hell, what's that to you? It's a mystery to me anyway why you never have money. Because my father does not sell cheese! Enough now! Here are 15 pounds - you won't get one more penny! Not a penny! Bobby! Is it ready? Come, let me do it. Good. Now it's burning... Put out the lights! That's good. Yes, that's good, Jack. All quiet now! Only those who really love are always waiting... You've still not come? How the raindrops disperse on the sleeves... I'm standing in the rain waiting for you ... for you. Everywhere I'm going I'm waiting for you ...always just you! The hands of the church tower clock slowly move further along. Oh, what's keeping you? Where is Albert? But, Albert - what are you doing here? Oh, I suddenly became so scared. What, scared? You... you shouldn't leave me alone. But Glory, it has to be. The ship will leave tomorrow. But why don't you take me with you? But Glory, one does not take a woman along into an uncertain destiny! I thought we would love each other. And lovers should be together. Even more in hard times. - You... - Albert! - David, everybody has a glass? - But where's Albert? Albert, let's drink to your health! Cheers, Albert! Cheers! Don't fall in love with a negro woman! Come back! See you again! So this will be my last impression of England: a chilly morning and rain. How cold your hands are. What, tears? No... just raindrops... You're a damn tough girl, Glory. But, look, here in my pocket is my commission as an officer in Her Majesty's New South Wales regiment! This is the beginning of something new. Really, Albert? Really. In a year I'll get you, if it just goes well a bit, I swear. One may only swear, Albert, if one is really serious. But you are serious, yes? But we both belong together, Glory. Will you always stand by me? Always, Albert... I love you! And will you wait for me? Always, Albert. Shhh, kids, look at that funny guy in the loge down there! Attention: one, two, three... Stop it - that's my father. Father, you, here, at the Adelphi? Yes, it's the only place one can be sure to find you! Follow me outside. I have to talk to you. Heh, Pudding's face is red as a raspberry! Now there's someone cheesed off! Wait - wait a minute... That's it! Enough, or I'll put you into office! - But Dad... - You're a wastrel! I brought the things with me, here, it's unbelievable! Here: 35 pounds, 90 pounds, 28 pounds, and here, 615 pounds! But I did not write this - I do my Sixes from the bottom up! As Lord Wilson does. What a meanness of Albert. Albert... ah!? Is that your fabulous Mr Finsbury? No... I mean, yes... but... Your call, Miss Vane! Oh, David? There's something going on against Albert. Intricate matter... Forged documents or something. The old Wells... Hurry, your scene! Later, in my dressing room. Gloria, you? Oh, Bobby... I've come because of a very... unpleasant story. David has told me about the bank case against Albert. Yes, it was quite stupid of Albert to change my 15 pounds to 615. You know, I always do the Sixes from the bottom up and... My dad was so angry! But one just does not forge bank statements. "Forge"... What a nasty word... for a female improvidence! - Eh? - Yes. I did paint a 6 before the 15. - What, you, and not Albert? Yes, me. My God... please understand, Bobby, the new play, the many costumes, and if a woman wants to remain reputable... - Did your father already take action? - Well, I don't know... - You must immediately go to him. - I should tell him that you...? Of course not my name, under any circumstances! Just tell him it's some lady among your friends, and not Albert. - But... - But your father is a gentleman! - You think so? He cannot expose a lady. - I'm a gentleman, Dad! - Ah!? I cannot expose a lady. Never! I see! This gets better and better! Now there's even one of your disorderly females behind it. - I demand that you tell me her name! - That's impossible. In any case, it wasn't Albert, and a gentleman... Spare me your endless "gentleman". Well, then I simply file a charge against this fine Mr Finsbury. But I tell you, it wasn't Albert, but... But...? Well? Now you will tell me the name, or... Okay, but give me your word of honour that you won't turn her in - she's a lady. You have to understand, Dad... the new play and the many costumes, and if a woman wants to remain reputable... and so Gloria painted a 6 before the 15... that's all. Gloria?... Aaah! Is this the person I saw in the theater yesterday? You gave me your word of honour, Dad! Nonsense! I gave my word of honour for a lady! This female is not a lady! On the contrary! The nation will be grateful, when I get that one into prison! In Paramatta's purgatory many a poor sinner had to burn, and returns as a new virgin later then to Eng-e-land. There finally has to made an example! Against this barefaced immorality that undermines the foundation of our state finally a barrier has to be erected! Gentlemen, judges and jury members of the high court, if London shall escape the bitter fate of Babylon, of Sodom, of Gomorrah, then do not let yourself be moved by that courtesan! You have all the evidence against this woman. You have seen a tragic example of how she ruins the sons of our most respectable citizens - spiritually, morally and financially. Financially. This is the only question here. Only this we have to judge. Did the accused forge the cheque, or not? My God... Defendant! You declared to Mr. Wells Jr. that you have done it. Mr Wells, is that right? It was like that: I always do the Sixes from bottom up. And this time - of course I do not want to get Miss Vane into trouble... Did she admit it or not? Yes. That is, eh... I told him that I did it, that's true. But it was a lie. So you revoke your confession? Yes. This is an outrage! Defendant Gloria Vane, then there is only one possibility: You know the real culprit and tried to cover him. Indeed, in connection with your case the name of a highly respectable personality did emerge, an officer in Her Majesty's regiment of New South Wales. My God! What's he saying? We can not assume that such a personality should have violated the law in such a grave way. Or should we? So you do admit, that Albert Finsbury... No! No... I did it! I... That will do. Paramatta your torments were the bitter fate for many. Yes, you have pay for everything, that you did not consider afore. The accused is sentenced to seven years of deportation to Paramatta. - To Australia. - Paramatta? The prison of Sydney! Paramatta... that's purgatory! ...may it forever spare you Paramatta's trail of pains! Paramatta brooms! Gosh! Sounds really not bad, that singing. Do they carry their chains even in the church? Of course. They made running away as hard as possible, even if it's just women. The guy at the door is loaded with live ammunition. Yea... looks just like he can't wait to open fire. I've already taken away the horse. So then, go to work! The wool doesn't unload itself alone! Boss - listen, how the good girls of Paramatta sing chorales. If I wasn't such a damned woman-hater, I should say, not bad at all! Yes - in prison they spoonfeed them with piety! Tell me - how's it about the bay? No, I already sold it to a Captain Finsbury - he's quite new here. I know him. He resorts a lot in the governor's house. Ah... very charming, Governor! You draw really well. Wouldn't you now show us your other portfolio, Mary? - No no. Not that. - But why not? Oh, a secret? Ah - so something like that. Charming girl, the governor's daughter. Yes... but don't take pains, I bet Finsbury will win the race. Please go quietly into the house, I'll be right there. Very nice man, this Captain Finsbury. Yes, my daughter also has a foible for him. Well, it seems! But now I'm really curious. Ah, the other portfolio! May I take a look into it? He's the son of Lord Pembrook - excellent family. But destitute. He has behaved excellent in the three quarters years, since he is here. Mrs Simpson with her lorgnon! Also very well done! You make quite fun of your unsuspecting fellow men! I just find my unsuspecting fellow men terribly funny. And here's the adjutant of your father! But now it occurs to me - I haven't seen myself. No. You're not in it. And when will you make a caricature of me? Never. Do you love me? Keep moving! Paramatta brooms! That one does not look like a criminal. Ah... the tall one? Paramatta brooms? What - Paramatta brooms? Do they make them in prison? 6 pence apiece. - What? 6 pence? - Come on! I'd rather buy an honest broom. Ah, broom remains broom and woman remains woman! I'd like to know, how many women deserved to be in Paramatta, if you could see behind the curtains. Isn't it, old friend? Well, Fanny, I'll go now. You're too dangerous for me. - Dangerous? - Yes... I am a tiny little bit enamoured of you. Unfortunately, you're enamoured of all women a tiny little bit! Oh, already in London, I've been told. Oh, London... that's like in a very distant fog. Yes, that's how London is. But it's considerably nicer there than here! At that time I decided to become a better person! I don't want you to be better, Albert. I think you're wonderful. But, Fanny, if your husband would sees us... - What do you mean? - He might misunderstand us. - You don't say that because of my husband, but... - But...? but because of this silly... silly goose! What goose? Of course, you don't know of nothing! Ah! You mean the governor's daughter! But that's a charming girl. No fervour. Some women know how to hide their fervour until after the wedding. Wedding? What do you mean? Oh dear! My husband. With my patients you can experience all sorts of things. - Captain! Haven't seen you for a while! - Hello Doctor! Excuse me, Fanny, for being late, but I've met Henry on the way. By the way, do you know my nephew, Henry Hoyer? Yes, I think so. Haven't you sold me a horse last spring? And how do you like the fox, Captain Finsbury? Thank you. I'm content. May I excuse myself? But... don't you want to stay a little longer? Unfortunately, I have to go home. Too bad. Thank God we don't have to work in the damn machine hall today. Basket-weaving is downright like rest. He should have received the letter by now, right? No demand! A letter for Captain Finsbury. May I deliver only personally. I have a deep yearning in me for you... for you! A gentle fairy tale softly whispers in me of you... of you! The sky is grey and my heart is so tired and no star of hope shines here for me And I know only one thing, I love you so much, and I'm yearning, I'm yearning for you... Thank you. - Does Captain have a wish? - No, thanks.. Paramatta brooms! I am sentenced to seven years in Paramatta. YOU are my only hope. You may come in. Madam, I'm here because of a somewhat delicate matter. - Please. I'm stationed here in Sydney, away from London for not very long, and I recently received a letter from a London friend. Every six months he sends a letter to me here in my exile, about the most interesting events in society, and... Yes? Well, last time he wrote he asked me to enquire about someone. Among your convicts is said to be... a story which, as you can imagine, has attracted considerable attention in London ...is said to be a formerly rather well-known actress. A certain... now where's that letter from my friend... a certain... Gloria Vane. Yes, she's here. So it's true... Do you want something from her? Pardon? No no, I myself do not. Only my friend. I've already said. He now would be very interested to hear... God, you can imagine, this was a sensation, glamour and gloom of a famous actress... If I remember correctly, she was a woman with a great name. Possible. Here she's No. 218. And how long has she still have to stay in Parramatta? Until her sentence is served... or until someone marries her. Marry? To increase the population figure in the English colonies of New South Wales Her Majesty has decreed that the deported convicts are allowed to marry and leave the institution in case of good behaviour. Oh yes, I know. So there's the prospect that the woman your friend is asking about can leave the prison in this way soon. Anything else? No. I'm much obliged to you. Oh, and may I ask what the convict has done? Unfortunately, I cannot give you any information about that. You want to talk to the prisoner? Then please fill in the form: Reason for the visit, name and occupation. No, thank you... I already said, I don't even know the woman. Apart from that, she is healthy and is doing well, as far as a woman in Paramatta can. Nelly! Do you really think he will get the letter? You can rely on the broom man. Who's there talking? Do I get no answer? Who's been talking, I want to know! Me... Madam. You're in Paramatta long enough to know what that means. I started talking to Nellie, Madam. Two lines in the behaviour book mean revocation of the marriage permission until the end the penalty period. That's 7 years Paramatta for you. Es war nur, Frau Vorsteherin, Mrs Warden, it was only... Margaret, over at the hospital, she soon gets a child... and so I just said that when it happens, I would like to help, because I have so skilled fingers. Yes, the skilled fingers that brought you here into prison. But Nelly only asked... Really? Well then. Go on working! Well, my little? Captain Finsbury has picked them for you in the garden, isn't it? Yes. If you allow... How charming. Thank you! I will put them right into the water. Don't you want to try one of these too? They are now also fabricated by the women in Paramatta. Thank you obediently, Excellency. When one considers what hands might have made these cigars... What hands? Excuse me...! Well, I hope you're not so dainty! Thank you. These women are human beings too! No, Excellency did misunderstand me. Tastes excellent, by the way. I just thought of something I've overheard. Parramatta is said to be home to a very illustrious guest recently. A once-celebrated actress from London - I once saw her at the Adelphi Theater... - Your Excellency, on this occasion... - Yes? I had actually intended to appeal to Your Excellency's kind heart whether she couldn't be let off the rest of the sentence in an act of grace. This is a very human thought of you, my dear Finsbury, very chivalrous... But if I may give you some advice: keep your hands off such things. Incidentally, I can't do anything for her. Law is law, and the prisoners must serve their sentences. Excellency... Besides, I wanted to talk to you about something else, my dear Finsbury. Please, Your Excellency! I've decided to make you my personal adjutant, instead of the retiring Burns, with the appointment to major. I congratulate you. I express my most obedient thanks to Your Excellence. Oh, don't mention it, you deserve it. And Excellence believes that nothing can be done for this woman? Which woman? Oh, you're still with this person from Paramatta? Yes, there's one possibility: if you marry her! But one can still imagine something better for you, isn't it? Excellency...! Albert! I love you so much! Earlier I've told father, that we... want to get married. Kitty, where are you! Magnus, help me. She won't let go of my wool. You terrible beast! Look, what a terrible vampire you are, just look! Ah, it's so hot! A terrible country. Not a drop of rain for three weeks! Well, well! Captain Finsbury has been appointed adjutant of the governor. Yes, I know! Really? How do you know? Kitty, now it's really enough! Go away! He himself told me recently. - Magnus, do you want a piece of ice? - No, thanks. I... met him accidentally. Really? Where? In front of his house. Fanny, I remember that I told you only a few days ago... Yes yes I know - you don't like to see me meeting with him. The only cultivated person in this terrible Sydney. How can someone just be so jealous, at that heat? Jealous? I'm not jealous. Oh no no, you're not jealous! I just want to save you from a disappointment. I think Captain Finsbury is a man who will never disappoint a woman. You think so? I think that in the end he must disappoint every real woman. Mrs Simpson said that the new uniform suits you marvellously, and that you're the most elegant officer in all of Sydney. And Mrs Simpson knows all about it, and so all say! Really? So goodbye. Albert! Why are you always so boring lately, and so correct? We're engaged now. But not officially, Mary. But all know it! What's the matter with you? Me? Nothing! But as you know, the duty, the new position... So please excuse me, I'm busy. Goodbye. Hello! Major Finsbury! Doctor! Good to meet you here. Had to talk to you anyway - Major Finsbury. I beg your pardon? My wife was with you in your apartment yesterday afternoon. Oh, she told you? Well, she claims to have met you outside your apartment. Indeed, yes. But women usually only tell half the story. Be that as it may. Fanny is still a child and children cannot be held responsible, I think. But you, you're a man, Major Finsbury. What are you trying to say, Doctor? By the way, men are more children than women, generally speaking. In any case, I would like to ask you to take a little less care of my wife. For there are husbands who have no sense of humour on this subject, Major Finsbury... generally speaking. - Hello! - Yes yes... Who's there? Doctor Hoyer from Sydney. Open up! 'Evening, Doctor! Is the Boss back already? - Good evening Henry! - Evening, Uncle! At Van Straten's farm I had a delivery. Looked pretty bad at first, but went well in the end. - Boy? Girl? - No. - What else? - Twins! Ben, 10 bottles of rum! 10 bottles? Ain't that a bit much? Ain't for the twins. My bay founders a bit. Leave it here, I'll bring it back when I'm going to Sydney. Selling wool? No, something completely different, but take a deep breath... a surprise! - Boss! - Yes? The rum! - Ah, the rum! - Surprise? - That one's for us. The others for the boys. - Now speak up!! Hey, everything for us? What event do we celebrate today? The Boss - he's up to something. If I only knew, what... Ah, I know, what. - So, what is it? - The same as you, Stout. - Ah... and what do I want? - Marry! - Ah, I see! You're completely crazy. Not one from Paramatta? But here aren't any others. Tim Hawkings also got his from there! But he just needed a woman for his laundry. Just for that he could as well have taken a Chinese. And the wife of Parkings? But she was convicted innocent. Of course, but many of them were deported just because of a littleness! Now don't get me wrong, I only want you to be happy. But with one of... Uncle, do you really think the risk with women from the so-called society is so much lower than with a woman from Paramatta? Ah, it's useless talking to you... You don't know Paramatta! You won't deny that I know the ropes about men. Back to front, I can tell you. Back from the time when I was standing on Hill Street. He doesn't even think of you any more. Dead sure he has another by now. He will get me. I know it. Yes -you know it. Four weeks ago he got the letter, he could have answered ten times by now! He will get me. He has to. Don't be silly! And on Sunday you come along, hear me?...to the "love parade". If I'd look as good as you, I'd gotten me a bloke long ago and out of here! What...? Someone's screaming! Oh God! Mabel Green - she's still locked up. Punishment cell. The stupid bitch tried to run away. Be quiet already! You have to get used to it. I can't bear it anymore. Conduct: good. May attend. The man who gets you will not be very happy about your orderliness! Conduct: medium. May attend. Conduct: sufficient. May attend. You have to break with your self-will and your disobedience, if you want to make a man happy! Madam, I don't want to marry. One must sleep one night over such a decision. Conduct: poor. Must not attend. - Conduct: medium. - May attend. Lights out! ...Knives out! All right, so now I'm going to decide for you: You will report for the bride market tomorrow, understood? Goodnight! Albert! "How many hours have I lost" "like in a fever, talking to fools..." Don't exert yourself - your mind will dry up anyway in this barren land! Here, better water it with rum! - I don't want no more. - You weren't invited anyway. Kind of funny, that boozing's no fun... Or do you think? You just can't handle your drinks! Go home and got to bed. It's already morning anyway. Yes, sadly... it should always be night. World weariness? You of all people! Just when you're about to marry the sweetest and kindest girl in Sydney. Marry? Who said that? - Fallen asleep! - Who said that? Come on... the old man tells it to all, that you will be his son-in-law. Are there only gossip mongers and sentimental wives around here? But everybody knows it... and Mary's young, pretty, rich, and has everything that can make a man happy! Do I look like a happy man? I sometimes really don't understand you lately. I sometimes don't understand myself. Listen Gilbert, you're a decent guy, and you're my friend, right? Debts? No, not this time. Well, what else? I demand that you tell me your honest opinion. - Well? - I cannot marry Mary. - Nonsense! Want another cigar? Well, don't you love her? "Don't you love her?" What's that supposed to mean? - You know, in London, there was a woman. - I see. And when I left I swore her... So what? Is that all? God, to how many women have I already sworn eternal love... Besides, what do you want? She's in London! - No, in Paramatta! - What? - In prison? - Yes. Did you talk to her? Of course I went to Paramatta at once. I wanted to see her, of course, but I couldn't, these prison walls, this close air, I couldn't. Of course... and? I've also spoken with the governor because of her, but it was not possible to do anything for her. What... you told him...? No, of course not, I couldn't, because of Mary. Well, you've already done quite a lot for the girl. What else do you want to do? Oh my God, I swore her... You can't leave a woman you love in prison! Ah nonsense, you love Mary! No, I do not love her! I only know I should have gotten Gloria out of prison. But you've tried everything! I have tried nothing. I could have married her. Tell me, have you gone insane? A convict? Do you know what that means? You will have to take off his uniform tomorrow. The governor's adjutant will become a nobody, going nowhere! And why? Out of false sentimentality, of a false sense of honour. What do you want to do with her? Lord Pembrook's son, a shoeshine? An innkeeper? God, with the lack of women here in Australia someone will soon get her out of that prison. Someone who matches her! Or, if you want to ease your conscience, write to the Queen. Send a petition to the courts in London. Yes... perhaps that would be a way out. And once she's free, you can help her along. Once you're married to Mary, you've got enough money. Stop it... enough of that. When one drinks too much, one easily loses self-control. Come on, boy, get up! Thank you, Gilbert. Hey - what's going on here? Please... as you wish. Alright boys, see you at the parade drill at 8 o'clock sharp this evening. Oh well... that's the sixth time I'm celebrating Her Majesty's birthday in this godforsaken country! Wide hips she's gotta have, young man, and fat, that's the main thing with women. That's how they differ from men. Nature wanted it that way. But you young people are more for something meager. That's decadence, son, decadence! Main thing is that she's not a thief, or a cheque forger or some such thing. In the end she runs away with the cash register. Nah! Rather a murderer. A businessman needs someone who's reliable. Henry Hoyer? You're also decadent. You're like a stranger, my son! I am, indeed... my father. Good, then please register here. By the way, I do not want my warning to be misunderstood, personally, it is no matter to me what you do, neither do I want to advise against it, I just follow my instructions. What do you intend to do? To draw the attention of the applicants on the consequences of their actions. The women here are criminals. - Not all, I would think. - Maybe. I think I'm to some extent able to judge a person's character myself. One always thinks that, as long as one is young. So if you're old, you don't believe in anything good anymore? You may be right, Mister... Hoyer. Well then, I have done my duty. Please follow me. Look... there they are! That one looks nice. You're crying again! Quiet! Hehe... well then... Is everyone here? - Almost 12 o'clock. - If you like we can begin! Can't someone open a window? It's so hot in here. Hey - the tall one over there is a devilish pretty dame. - Pardon me? - Convicted for forging a bank statement. Forgery? No, for God's sake, this is not for me. Well, Mr Hoyer... have you lost your courage? I don't know... it all went by so fast... If we could only open a window. No one will take me! For sure! No one will take me! Ah baloney! For now they just look at our bodily assets. No one will take me! Probably the windows can't be opened at all. Hello... I like you. Who is this? Gloria Vane. Seven years imprisonment for forgery... Hey, why so heated? Here's one like the other anyway. So if you want her... Bloody hell! All right... Now he looks like a dame! I take the fat one. She looks sturdy. I think it's because the windows are barred. Excuse me, when I... when I ask you here in front of all the people... Do you want to become my wife, Miss? Yes. - But only if we will have a church wedding! - Yes! For I have a farm, 10 hours from here. We could get married there straight away. If you want, right over there on our street, there's a church... I found one, Madam! One moment! The reverend likes to earn a little extra money and could handle the necessary paperwork right away. Right away? Thank you, Madam, but our sheriff at home sure will do it as well. Well then. In two hours you can pick up your new wife. Please? And you? Yes, well... that would be... the fat one. Come, take this, in memory! But no, Nelly, your mirror... Oh please take it, you need it more than I do now. You look pretty in your new dress! Now just one more thing, and we have the whole endowment. But, don't buy it so terribly much! No buts - I buy only what a woman needs most. Please take care of bay for a while. Come, Ben. - And, how do you like her? - Great, Sir! - Hello! - Ah, Mr Hoyer! - I take this! - The Mirror? Where is Mercury Avenue, please? I'm a stranger here myself, Miss. Please stand still, you hear? Didn't I tell you to stand still! Oh, please, where is the Mercury Avenue? - You're already here! - Ah! Do you perhaps know a Captain Finsbury? Major Finsbury? He lives... wait... down there - the last or second to last house on the right. - Ah, thank you! Hello! Well, Mrs farmer's wife - how do you like yourself? I thought, in the long run Nelly's mirror will be too tiny. You seem to think of me to be quite vain! What I think of you I will tell you at our silver wedding, at the earliest! Paramatta brooms! Gee up, Brown, now we're going home! Bye, Mr Hoyer! Who was that soldier you were talking to? I was only asking for the place of a friend. Here, in Sydney? Yes, I know someone here, a Major Finsbury. - But I guess he's not here anymore. - You mean relocated? Here we're always make a stop. The only watering hole in the whole neighborhood. What I wanted to say... I've recently met a captain Finsbury. - I think, he's even major now. - Ah... major? - Do you know him? - I met him only briefly... He's friends with my uncle. That is, more with my uncle's wife. Come, Brown! Rather funny situation, isn't it? I mean, the two of us... What's so funny about it? Well, we're now, so to speak... husband and wife! Isn't it? - Husband... - Yes! Yes... Henry, do you believe that I am a criminal? When I first saw you, I knew that you do not belong to Paramatta. And how do you know that? I just know it... That's why I know it, Glory... that's why. You like her too, eh? Tell your master not to be sad when I... Ready! I'm the happiest man in all of Australia. Now it goes uphill, eh, Miss Brown? That's my horse's name. Hear? We're a real wedding coach, eh? When I saw you there for the first time, among all the others... there was a moment I felt like never before in my whole life, when you looked at me. I think we don't even tell the people on the farm anything about it... that you were in prison. And anyway, it think you will like it with me. It's still all a bit primitive, but I even have a rocking chair. And once the mirror hangs in the room... Stop! - Henry! - What is it? - I cannot, Henry. I cannot stay with you. What, not with me...? No... I love another man. I must see him. I only went with you to get out of this hell. There was no other way for me. I wanted to run away from you... but I cannot lie to you. But Glory - that's all a goddamn bloody nonsense! It's not nonsense, Henry. I must see him. I don't think of letting you go. You stay, understood? You can't force me, Henry! Why didn't you let yourself get out of Paramatta by that other one? I don't know... I think he couldn't... for he is an officer. Goodbye, Henry. Is it in the end this Captain Finsbury? Wait, Gloria! Gloria... please wait! May the Lord bless your entrance He should be here any moment. Quiet! Boss - as it's been written in the Bible: "May the Lord bless your entrance." - Take down that thing! - What? Haven't you heard? We should take down that thing. - But... didn't you bring a woman? - Woman? - Wasn't that why you... - Ah, no women there for the boss. - Stout, now it's your turn! - What? - Yeah! - We sure will find something that matches your taste! - Silly rascal! Sir Burton and Lady Mabel Burton. The Honorable Sir Frederick Burton and Lady Mabel Burton. Mister Peepercorn and Miss Ellen Peepercorn. Captain Goodwilling. Miss Mary Jones. Mister Bill... Wallace. Ladies and gentlemen. In deep reverence we are today celebrating the birthday of Her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, the ruler of Great Britain on this side and beyond of the seas. So let us not forget in this hour, Her Majesty... Goddammit! Please, where's the Mercury Avenue? This is the Governors palace. You have to go there. - Thank you! Crazy wench! May I ask for the lady's name? I just want to talk to Major Finsbury. That will hardly be possible. But it's very urgent! Tell him: Gloria Vane. I must ask the lady to wait outside. Perhaps there on the bench. On the bench, yes. My dear friends! Please allow me to call you friends. I want to use this beautiful occasion to inform you that my dear daughter Mary got engaged with my adjutant, Major Finsbury... and that I invite you all to the wedding, taking place 14 days from now. My dear Mary, I feel with you! What a lucky devil, this Finsbury! - Yes? - A Miss Gloria Vane is waiting outside. There! Ah, the fireworks! You said she wanted to wait on the bench! Tonight will be rain. Finally! Well, Stout, even heaven is crying over your sacrifice! I've always thought you were a women-hater. I still am. And you're a rascal! But what else can I do - if the boss won't do it! With 'first-class wool' I'd imagine something different! 'Quite alright'? That's the best wool you've ever had in your warty hands! Raging again! Since we were in Sydney, he's like crazy. That's like a storm - or a flooding. One can only wait till it's over. Don't tell me things like that. What are you actually going to do? I now cross-breed on a large scale with Caspian Longear. In three years I will have a model herd of 1000. But you don't have enough water. Water enough. You just have to drill deep enough. I tell you, I drill 100 feet deep if I have to. You're an optimist. You're a miserable penny-pincher. But if you think you can get the price down, you're mistaken. Good evening. - Hello Stout, the coach for Mr Peepercorn. - Yes, Boss! Hey - what's with that damn mirror in the room? Didn't I tell you to throw it away to the outback? Oh come on, that fine mirror, would be a real pity, Boss. So out with it! Understood? Hello, Mr. Hoyer... Well... I pay the price. Oh... you pay. Well Stout - no coach. The boss always gets his way! He's a pighead! The girls will be in for a surprise when they get to see me, I tell you! And what's the news in Sydney? At the Sydney casino a troupe of sword-swallowers is performing. But I guess that doesn't interest you that much. But people still speak of the fireworks... it really was great. Ah yes, it was the queen's birthday. Well, it was more because of the engagement of the governor's daughter. Look at that - the girl's got engaged? Here, have a drink! Sorry to say, we have no ice. Damned heat! Yes, with Major Finsbury. With whom? With the adjutant of the governor. You have sold him a horse the other day. But tell me... are you sure? Heard it with my own ears. I was invited. Come on, Ben, help me. You don't really want to throw it away in the outback? Ben... get the coach! Don't forget water and blankets, we're going to Sydney! - Tonight? - Yes, hurry up! Yes, you come along... Now she needs us. "Now she needs us"? What does that mean? - I think we can leave the mirror. - What? I am a virgin, Love, you must believe me! Even if I get around a lot in this wide world... Really great, isn't it? The favorite of my audience. In a few days you will be that too, Gloria Vane! Jim, half a bottle of rum! You have one too, eh? Something to eat, please. Oh... guess you had no work for some time? It was so hard to find something. A hellish place, this Sydney! - Jim, a curried rice! - Yes, Boss. Come, I will now show you your dressing room. Madam, this is your realm. May not be as as pompous as your wardrobe in England, but the most noble in Sydney. I'm sure you don't mind that it's also our rum storage place. I have no costume. Oh, there are still enough things here from your predecessor. I want to get ready now. Please don't be bashful, Madam. Or did they drum that much morality into you in Parramatta? I hope you'll be normal again soon and stop playing hide and seek with your charms Excuse me... Damn it! Can't you keep the whiskey cooler at this heat? Excuse me, a lady. Good evening, Albert... you no longer come to see us! What do you mean by that, Mrs Hoyer? I've always been waiting for you so much. What else can I do if you don't come? You don't even ask me to sit down? You will leave the house immediately, understood? I have no time for your baublery. But Albert! But you have to be reasonable, Mrs Hoyer. Tomorrow you're going to marry Mary, and I should be reasonable? And why not, please? But maybe... maybe I love you, Albert! Love! What you all call love - that little passion and excitement! You can't even imagine. You feel that much for Mary? Nonsense, I'm not talking about Mary. May I, please, Mrs Hoyer? - But Albert! - Yes? I don't understand you. No! That's true. Come on. I accompany you outside. Please, sir... Listen... Your husband may never know that you were here. He loves you, and you love him too. I know it. Yes, Albert. For sure. You're always so strict. So consistent. So terribly consistent! With everything... Much better than never to decide oneself. Come on, I have to go now. I have an appointment. Well, Albert - quite a jamboree! Yes, the only place in this damned Sydney where you can find some pretty girls. Good evening, gentlemen. - May I send you some company? - No thanks. We're choosy. Now come on, the girls here ain't bad, they could also pass in London! Don't say Sydney lags behind London! I in fact managed to engage a star directly from the Adelphi Theater. 'Directly' may be a bit exaggerated. She had a guest appearance here in Paramatta previously. But that's a sensation! Right! Now look at that fellow! - What... where are you going? - I want to go. Haven't you heard? An actress from London! Now don't be a spoil sport! Finsbury's not what he used to be... Only those who really love are always waiting... You've still not come? How the raindrops disperse on the sleeves... I'm standing in the rain waiting for you... for you. Everywhere I'm going I'm waiting for you ...only for you! The hands of the church tower clock slowly move further along. Oh, what's keeping you? Do you no longer think of me? And I'm standing in the rain waiting for you, for you. How people look at me... For half past six you have asked me to come. Shall I go away? But where shall I go, I've got only you in this world... I'm standing in the rain waiting for you, for you. Everywhere I'm going I'm waiting for you, ...only for you! The hands of the church tower clock slowly move further along. Oh, what's keeping you? Do you no longer think of me? Stop it! Ladies and gentlemen! The Song of the Virgin! I am a virgin, Love, you must believe me! Even if I get around a lot in this wide world. And even if I might get robbed six times by seven men, I keep on hitting my big drum, I keep on making boom boom boom! As virgin, a virgin, a vi-ir-gin! All sing along! I am a virgin, Love, you must believe me! Even if I get around a lot in this wide world... I'm back in a second! Oh, excuse me. I didn't know, there's a gent here with the lady... I'm done in a moment. Just wanted to... Here. Thank you, Sir. Actually, gentlemen shouldn't come here. Not because of morals, you know... But as we have our rum storage in here. Well, you know what I mean. But I haven't seen anything. My God - how did you get here! Glory - come, we go away! We'll stay together now. You and me. We'll now stay together forever. Albert, I don't love you anymore. I don't love you. But, Glory... that's not possible! We no longer understand each other, Albert. I've waited too long. I've been a coward. But without you I cannot live. I cannot live that way, Glory. Why don't you say anything? Do you love... another? You've come too late, Albert. I'm on another shore now... you know? I have been in Paramatta. Paramatta... to me you're no criminal! I don't care what you have done. But you should care, Albert. I have forged. A cheque. A cheque on 615 pounds. That's not true! Yes, Albert, it is true. Well listen, you can't tell me you were an actress in London? You can't fool me! Thank God, finally raining! You've spoiled the whole mood for the guys out there with your dirge. What's that supposed to be? Wrecking my precious furniture? I'm standing in the rain, waiting for you... everywhere I'm going I'm waiting for you... only for you. The hands of the church tower clock slowly move further along. Oh, what's keeping you? Do you no longer think of me? Love, I am a virgin, Love, you must believe me, even if I get around a lot in this wide world. Hey - in case you see the great actress from London, tell her... What? She's here. Here? Where? Love, you are a virgin, Love, you must believe me, even if I get around a lot in this wide world.... Hey, Miss - I'm much obliged to you for using my stage box as a bed-chamber. Sorry. But I have no room. It's okay. Well, I want to settle the matter with you amicably. As from tomorrow I've engaged a new act, "Olga and her trained poodle". Guess my audience will like that better than your "art". Tonight you can perform once more, but do me a favour, sing something funny. Something of the kind of the Song of the Virgin. You get paid 10 shillings. Nobody should say that I'm meanly. You're a gentleman, Director, but I don't want to perform anymore. Well then, it's up to you. I'm going back. Where are you going? - Hey! Hello! - Ah, Mr Hoyer! Where lives Captain Finsbury? - Mercury Avenue. Straight ahead. - Thank you. Hello Stout! You can go on. But he won't have much time. He's getting married today! Hello! No one home? Get up, Major Finsbury! You miss your wedding! Uncle Magnus? What's this...? Over. Guess I better report it to the regiment right away... Where have you left Gloria, Major Finsbury? Good Morning, my dear cantor. For the beginning I want the song of the Lilies of the Field. The first and second verse, and then maybe the tenth as well. We cannot possibly sing them all, otherwise the soup will be cold. Excuse me. My dear Mary, all the best. Thank you. Reverend, you said that about the duties really beautifully. It just makes me a bit embarrassed. She's a child - a pure child. Listen: When Albert steps out that door, you start walking. You both meet before the altar - and then you just kneel down. - Kneel down? - And wait. We'll soon begin, good luck. Aside... May I speak to Your Excellency! What is it, for God's sake? Something terrible has happened. Oh it's you, Magnus! Did you forget the keys? It wasn't locked. What's wrong? You look distressed... Where have you been? Where do you come from? Magnus... Magnus! I come from Albert! From Albert? Do you know? What? He's dead. Dead...? No... oh my God! You have to go... you have to go! Quick... you have to go! At the harbour... come... there's a ship! I get your things for you... No... that's not good... the ships will be observed! We'll go to Henry! We will hide. Don't just stand there! Do something! Tell me - why do I have to go? They can find you any moment! They could see you! They will look for you! They will arrest you! Are you really so worried about me? Any moment someone can come! You have to hide! You have to hide... But, please, calm down. Nothing did happen to him from me. He did it himself. - So this is Paramatta? - Yes. Well, Stout, you're so quiet? Shouldn't I better think this over one more time? Nah... now it's too late! Hello! Young man...? I heard a certain Gloria Vane appears in your show. She's already disappeared. Bad luck, young man. But the question is whether you missed much. Do you know where she went? No. She said something like "going back". But what she meant by it... "Going back"? Now what are you doing here? I want back... into the prison. You can't... you've been released! But where can I go? If you want back - though that never happened before - then your husband has to file an application first. My husband? Yes... but I can ask the wardress. You can't stay here, Miss. There will be a wedding. I'm so tired. Well, if you keep quiet... Now just take that stuff off me. Song 101, first to third verse. I hope there is no C sharp in it? The C sharp is broken! It's not that important. And I'll tread the bellows. They're here. I get the Reverend. That was a splendid rain - isn't it? Good for the harvest. Thank the Lord. Reverend! It's high time, the couple is waiting. Already waiting! What are we going to do now? You have to excuse me for a few minutes. One of the ladies from Paramatta wishes to tie the knot with a life companion. And what will become of me? Let us prefer the soul to the flesh, my friend. I'll be right back. Boss! What are you doing here? The same as you! Aren't we? If you would take me for your man, you would do me the biggest favour. And if you would want to love me... Henry... I want to. I want. And Peter... But that's two couples! I prepared only one verse! It's really not that important. Well then! And Peter was sleeping in prison between two soldiers, and was bound with two chains, and two soldiers before the door were guarding the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord stood next to him, and his light shone in the cell, and the angel said to him: "Follow me!" And, Io, he rose... and the chains fell off his hands.
