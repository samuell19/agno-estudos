(gentle music) (upbeat music) - I went out. I was drunk before I already went out. I was like really happy and saw this lad and thought "Oh, I'm going to have him tonight." So I like to start talking to him. He didn't really speak much. He just like stood there. And I said to him, "All right, are you up for it?" And he said, "Up for what? And I'm like, "Are you up for sex?" (intense music) - He came and he sat beside me. And at the beginning, I thought he was very handsome. He had long blonde hair down to his waist and he had those big corn flowers eyes. Guys with really long hair, they look a bit like girls and I thought, "A man who looks like a woman." I found that very appealing. - And he was also very, very muscular. And I felt very feminine in his company in that sense of being aware of this kind of incredibly strong, such a brutal force. - Whereupon, just completely out of the blue, and she asked me, "Have I ever kissed a French girl?" Immediately, I said, "No." She just very delicately put her fingertips on my cheeks and just kissed me. And I was absolutely astonished. I was just, I must have gone bright red. - I wouldn't have been surprised by a kiss or something. That wouldn't have shocked me at all that, you know, but I got, I opened the door to the loo, just walked in, she was there, and we sort of recognized each other. And it was only a matter of seconds before she dragged me into the loo and fucked me. (soft moaning) - So some of them were artists. Some of there were drug dealers, prostitutes. It's very crowded and there's this big buzz. And because there are so many people having a good time, you feel you can do what you want, and you just listen to great music and have a good time, and it's a bit decadent, but you really have a good time, you know. (soft jazz music) - I was dancing against these bars like pole dancer and touching myself up when I danced. Our bouncers love it and I love it that people like watching me. I used to do it when I went out with my friend, Donna, 'cause she's like loud like me, so I can do stuff like that. But like other people go out are quiet, so I feel silly. I know I was looking at average guy and I was really nice. And then I go now look slightly Leonardo de Caprio? Paul Nichols, Joe wicks, or Easterners, Babyface. Cute. He said he's seen me dancing in the past. - As I say, when I went back into the compartment, so the, the elderly couples?, it pulled the blinds down and the dim, the lights. And I basically just shuffled into my seat and just avoided looking directly at this young lady. Anyway. - There was a very gorgeous woman on the other side of the cafe, who I thought was giving me the eye, but I didn't, I didn't actually want to blame my vanity too much. So I sort of let it go. But over the course of the evening, we were definitely visually sort of flirting with one another. But at one point I got up to go to the loo and I hadn't realized that she'd actually gone into the loo before me. - And he said, he said to me, I'm a bricklayer. So maybe it was a bit naive, but I believed him. - And actually it turned out that he worked on the bit he built railways? around what is, so he was more, I understand is a NAVY - And then later on, he touched my hand and I said, you can't be a brick layer. Your hands are soft, like a bank, mine?, natural, something, you know. - Huge thick fingers, you know, the, and, and the sort of hands that you look at and think they could crush me with one. Crush. - And he said, no, actually I just came out of prison. Policeman had a go at me and that I hit him over the head. And then they put me in prison. - He was living a lifestyle that I sort of thought had gone out with the 19th century in a sense of this sort of idea of these men, building roads or building railways, lots of sympathy for his very lonely life without women. - I hear that he, he went to prison and he beat up. So policemen, I like that a lot, in a disrespectful way. That pleased me a lot, or the excitement of being a bad boy, you know, like he does, he's a villain and he's good looking. And, oh, he is too much - I was quite enchanted by her. I was beginning to get, to become in love with her. - I fancied him a lot and I wanted to do something with him. So he said, you want, you want to go to that little parking? So and he said, you want to go in there in the dark? And I said, yeah. Okay. So we went in there and then we started kissing. - And then, so we got talking a bit more, like, we were just sat on these benches, like kissing and that, and they're like, this is our drone pilots and oh, no, I want to do it here. And he's going, no, no, we can't. No, we can't. And we just got carried away and it just started from there. - He just lift up my skirt and he started stroking my leg and pulling my skirt up and then stroking my thighs. Then I bend down. And he started kissing my leg from the bottom of my leg, you know, to the calf. And then he keeps me on just on top of my suspenders. I could feel his lips against my stockings and I found very erotic. - She was very relaxed and I was quite on edge. - And then I looked up in horror and because of the street lights I saw two heads of police men going by stop stop. There are two parties, especially who was coming out of prison. Maybe it's the guy hit over the head. So I took just stop because it's too dangerous. You know. - When I'm not, relaxed. I tend to shake a little. - I think I frightened a little bit. I don't think you were really into it. Cause he just seemed too quiet not normal. - Well, fear can feel nearly 60 sometimes because when you're frightened in your stomach, you feel to make sex more sexy there must be an element of danger or risk. Imagine what he could have done to me because I can, I can have sex with a really dangerous man. So I've got guts. - And she, she put her hand on my arm like this and she's sitting across line and she learned to cross, put my hand on my arm. And she said, what's the matter? I said, no, sorry. It's okay. It's okay. - He had the smoothest skin I ever touched. his skin was like silk. He had a face soft, enjoyable, skinny, and he was beautiful. - And she lent across the, the compartment, and started to kiss me. And at the same time, she picked my hand up and laid it on her breasts. And , my God, this is not the week before. What are you supposed to do? - I was quite clear when I got on the bus that I thought we were fairly likely to have sex and really kind of turned on and excited about this idea of, you know, that we were going to be able to really, really be naughty. - By this time. My heart was really going, boom I think you could hear it at the time. But as soon as she did this, I looked the word leads people. It was knowing the right door, and open but, and then she, she climbed on top of my lap and she took total control. - And he was, he was very cute as well in a way that he was, you know, he was quite, quite sort of shy. And, and I was very in control in the sense that I knew I could completely control the proceedings. It's like a week or two would go as far as I wanted to go, there was no sort of sense of, of me being in any kind of danger from him. - He saw my dog collar and he said, oh, you're a sexy bitch, really know, not because I'm a bitch, boys like a female dogs you know. - I was like, he was sat like this, you know, sat on top. People were watching, but I just didn't care. Well I didn't really know at first, 'cause I just didn't think no one would think anything of it with it being dark. Then afterwards everyone were like clapping and cheering, because a girl came up and stopped. And one of his friends started talking to us in-between, (laughs) this girl who knew his girlfriend said also she wants to talk to us and.(laughs) - We had sex all the time. Forget sleeping There's no, you can sleep anytime you know. With the beautiful guy like this, you're not going to sleep you know. - And the, the sad thing about it all was, this was just too, too unusual, too excitable for me. And the actual act, once penetration had occurred, the actual act of, of sex was, was literally 30 seconds. And I felt sort of, dreadful. Things were running through my mind like she probably thinks all English men can't make love and ejaculate within 30 seconds and this is it. You know, () - As we left the cubicle, I don't know how long it was. I think time was kind of lost. I asked her for a telephone number, and even her name, but she wouldn't have anything to do with it. And I left, never, never seen her again, never knowing who she was, and never meeting her again. - So clearly that was her intention all along anyway, I treasure the memory from my perspective. - I have this fantasy that, that in a way he will always keep the story to himself because you know, it's the sort of things that he might tell somebody and they might just go, (laughs) yes, mate, you know, I'm sure that four? women? just threw themselves at you. - Everyone knows the school. When I went back for my exams, everybody was looking , is it true?is it true? It's like, ah, we having sex in the middle of the dance floor. (laughing) No - She was so bold, but also some way quite some like, fearful I suppose, not to hang around. Maybe she was straight, or not straight, but closeted. - It's like catch up to utopia, from utopia utopia going next time Love. Love, saying go next time to utopia, I'll give you one. But no, thanks. - I just felt it was really naughty, and daring, and it was just very sexy. Incredible, very good. Very good. And I think I must've come out looking, looking like I'd just been fucked, I must have had. And that was part of the shock I think too, that the idea that you could have anonymous sex was really good anonymous sex, with a stranger (laughs), but it was just? a figment of my imagination. - I always invent something because, I don't know, sometimes I make sex a bit like cinema, you know, you, you make a scene for it. It's just, you create your fantasy, you know, use your imagination. It's like diving in the sea or climbing up a mountain. It's like, if you, if you brave the danger, it gives you importance, he makes you somebody, he makes you, I mean, it's not, he makes me macho but if I can brave a danger, I'm something. I'm important. I mean, I don't know. I'm worth something. - I like to talk about it afterwards. Tell people and shock people. I like people to talk about me. So they all think that they're being nasty by slagging me off but actually I like it. Yeah 'cause my life must be interesting, if they talk that way.
