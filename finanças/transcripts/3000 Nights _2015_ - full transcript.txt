Farid! Are you okay? I'll get you out. - Hurry up, I'm dying. Why did they arrest you? There was nothing. How, nothing? They asked me about the boy, the checkpoint and the explosion. Why didn't you tell me? - Because nothing happened. Who is this guy? -I do not know him. We have to prove that we have nothing to do with him so that we can go. How? -I do not know. Tell them ... That he threatened you with a knife or something. He didn't threaten me. - I know, but ... That's your only option. Give it to me. Give me! Give it to me, it's mine! Let go, it's mine, bitch!

You can't give birth in prison. Put her in another cell for her safety. You will have to get rid of it. What are you doing here? Give me your things. I'm Rihan. And this is lm Ali. She has a grandson in a men's prison. Fadi and adija, God set them free. These are sisters D amila and Fidaa. They were arrested at the school. Sanaa is a Palestinian fighter from Lebanon. He's been here for 15 years. Why are you locked up? What were you doing with the warden? Why did they let you see your husband? Calm down, Sanaa. Si lana? Give her water. The boys' school was close to ours. They wanted us to demonstrate with the girls. Everyone is sleeping. Twist this. First, we said ... We want books, pens and notebooks. And family visits. And Fidao and I want to take exams. And to move us away from those. Warmer clothes and better food. Family visits are the most important. I will die if I do not see Yusef, Samar and Kareem. What if they get us? Then we'll know why. Come on, take it. Good night. Take it lightly like this and press the pedal. Be careful not to shake your hand. One without an arm is enough. I'm glad they cut it off for me, that I don't need to sew military uniforms. Lajal! Look what I did. Palestine. That's how I caress them. - See they can't hear you. Kar naj me! You are in your third month, time is running out. If you want an abortion, I can help you. I can't decide without a husband. Vpra.aj ga. Farid? Farid. I have to tell you something. Nose a sem.

Come on, come on! D amila! Fidaa, come here. In return for what did they allow you to talk to your husband? Are you satisfied? I'll cut your neck. I'll give it to you. Enough! Give me mir! Don't you have a heart? -Give me peace! Ubila te bom. Give me mir. Stop it! Can't you see she's pregnant? Give me mir! Wait a minute. Open your palm. Come on, you're crazy! Get away from me! Come see this. You lost a lot of blood. You have to rest. Say hello. If you need anything, give me a call. My name is Ajman. Come on, move. Remember how Mom combed our hair? Pogre am jo. Don't tell her. Right? I will not. I'm okay. This is how she braids my hair. Arab cunt. If I cut off my other hand, you know who your father is. He says you're a bastard. I know my father and all my ancestors, kuzla! Let's see what kind of test you're from. Kuzl to! Air! That bitch started. What's happening? Where do you think you are? I'll kill you if you don't stop. I have to get out of here. Just avoid heartburn. Who do you mean by that? -Sanai and Ze'evi. When they cook something, we sled everything. How am I supposed to have a baby here? What if something happens to him? What if I die? Who will raise him? Don't worry, Mom. Whatever happens, be strong. �ivjo. I'm your lawyer, Rahel Steiner. I tried everything, but they don't want to miss it. There must be some way. Don't they know she's pregnant? You have to tell me everything so I can defend you. Do what needs to be done. Lajal has to come out. Judge, my client is a young woman. She is expecting a baby. Why would I get involved in such a case? My clients, and also that guy, it has nothing to do with the attack. Bring him. Lajal Asfur. The accused threatened you did he force you to take him in the car? Answer. What do you say? He didn't threaten me. I didn't hear you, louder. He didn't threaten me. Five minutes rest. Judgment! Following the court's indictment of a terrorist attack, interrogated both sides and heard their testimony, sentences Lajal Asfur to eight years in prison. They gave me 48 hours to leave the house. It was sealed with a red ribbon. Our visa for Canada will expire. If I don't leave now, I will lose him. Razmi�ljam, to settle there and find us a home. Will you let me have a baby alone? Do you really want to have a child in prison? You will be imprisoned for eight years. Do you realize what that means? Eight years! If you ask me to have an abortion, it will not happen. Poslu�aj. I will have a baby and a dot. If you want to leave, go ahead. Girls! The letters have arrived. Go get them! Im Ali! Thank God! Sanaa! Nothing for me this time too? - So for us? Im Ali, this one is from Fadi's and Chadi's mother. Read it to me. I promise you will be able to get more beautiful.

They must be approved by the security service. Lajalina's mother asks her to be there for the birth. The answer is no. Why? -Security. For God's sake, a little humanity won't kill you. �love�nosti? Do I have to remind you how your son died? Do you think I'll ever forgive them? that they sent an 18-year-old into a dirty war? Do you think this is a dirty war? The woman you are defending has bloody hands. We cannot adjust the rules for everyone. But calmly adapt them for Israeli captives. Are you counseling? I hope they get them this time. My heart told me I was going to jail ... My heart told me you were all going to jail ... Ena. Two. Tri. Do you see them? Fidaa! There she stood! Quick, give me something. Fidaa, hurry up! Fidaa!
