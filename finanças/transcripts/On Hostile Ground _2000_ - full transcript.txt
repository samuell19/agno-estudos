SMILEY: 281 south or north? JIMMY GUTRO: Oh, no Smiley. Come on man it's too early. SMILEY: I don't whistle while I work I'll be old before my time. That ain't whistling. [harmonica] SMILEY: North. Smiley, [inaudible] SMILEY: [speaking french] [harmonica] [saxiphone] FEMALE VOICE 1: Morning, Matt. MATT ANDREWS: Good morning, Ellen. FEMALE VOICE 2: Morning Matt. Morning. Morning everybody. FEMALE VOICE 3: Morning sir. Pomerance built in blues. I was to sink the foundation under 12 feet. CO-WORKER 1: I thought those were already a code. They are, I want them deeper. You head him. WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Matt, what do I tell Richard Friedman about his whole six results from Tennessee? Tell him it isn't nickel and I'll have a full assay next week. WOMAN ON INTERCOM: OK. What's this? CO-WORKER 1: It's from the freeway on ramp construction. One of the engineers found it. Take a whiff. By the freeway on ramp. Yeah. [harmonica] Oh my god. Smiley? Don't mess with me man. What's going on? Smiley, are you all right? Oh god. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Of course. We've got 26 parades over the next four days Henry. Which one are you talking about? Oh, I'm sure that can be arranged. Yes, but I'm going to want a free liposuction and face lift when I'm 50. I'll get them over to you. All right, bye. Good morning. ASSISTANT: Morning. Can you make sure that two mayor's stand passes for Mardi Gras get over to Dr. Henry Dumond for Mardi Gras day and make sure that the seats are close to the mayor. He's a very big contributor. ASSISTANT: The mayor wants to see you. OK. Morning, Anthony. ANTHONY: Hi. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Allison, there has been a tunnel collapse at Deveaux Park. There's a worker missing. I want you out there supervising. Call me as soon as you know anything and get press secretary Regan out there too. The news crews have already been all over it. Oh good they found you. Good god. GEORGE REGAN: This is the last the Mayor needs. This is last thing anybody needs. Did they find the worker? No, they're not going to find him alive. I can promise you that. NEWS REPORTER: Mr. Reagan, Ms. Beauchamp. I'll handle this. I'm gonna call the Mayor. NEWS REPORTER: Can you give us any details? Yes, I can. Let's step over here. Oh, Cindy. NEWS REPORTER: I'm here at Deveaux Park with city press secretary George Regan. What details can you give us at this point? All we know right now Donna is that one of the city's large drainage tunnels collapsed due to ground subsidence below it. There's a worker trapped in the rubble and city rescue teams are searching for him now. We're just hoping and praying that he's all right. Let's see what we got here. A lot of organic carbon for a high temp. Yeah, maybe from that peep burning last summer out in the marshes. MATT ANDREWS: Maybe, what's it doing by the freeway? WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Matt, Allison line one. Yeah. Hi, I'm at an emergency and I cannot leave. I'm supposed to pick Cindy up at the airport in half an hour. I promised member I'd pick her up myself. Can you pick her up for me? Nope, I can't. I got a 12 o'clock. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Oh, would you please, Matt? Would you please? All right, all right. What's the flight? Trans-regional flight 1715. OK. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: I'll call you in a bit. Yup. I got to take off for a bit. Jimmy, what can I tell the Mayor? I've never seen anything like it. It's got to be 40, 50 feet. Some kind of sinkhole. And is that his wife? JIMMY GUTRO: Yeah, it is. She's all broken up. I'll be around if you need me. Mrs. Smiley, I'm Allison Beauchamp. I'm from the Mayor's office. I just want you to know we're doing everything that we can to find him. Everything, OK? MALE VOICE: We found him. Mrs. Smiley. No, no, no, no. Please, please, no. [crying] SMILEY'S DAUGHTER: My daddy's dead. GREETER: Hi, hi, hi. CINDY EVERS: Matt, hi. Cindy. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I haven't seen you since you were a-- I got my haircut. Yes, you did. Wow you look great. Thanks, so do you. Where's aunt Allison? She had an emergency. Let me take that. We're gonna go meet her. How was your flight? It was great. Jeez. She's It's so good to see you. MATT ANDREWS: You too. [phone ringing] Hi, mom. Please stop with the cameras. Would you move back please? GEORGE REGAN: What will they fill this up with? Concrete I imagine. How fast can that be done? Engineer is gonna need to investigate. A hole that size just isn't normal. Be careful. It's Mardi Gras. Nothing is ever normal. We've got to keep everyone away from here. We'll be securing the area. Just keep the news crews as far back as you can. People are here for Mardi Gras. There's more than enough spectacle without a media circus over this. Can you just park here? You can if you have one of these. Contract with the city. We have them at some of their sites. See what kind of ground they're building on. It's not as exciting as field work, but it's hell of a lot cleaner and safer. I can tell you that. CINDY EVERS: Are you still doing any mining? No I sold my shares to Angel Valley. Now I just tell other people what they found. CINDY EVERS: Oh my good. Look at all this. I've been back here since we moved away. Thank you. There you go. I haven't had any of these in forever. I remember all just buying, and selling, and trading them. Well you know they throw 50 million of those a year? Mom would never let us come down here cause all the women bearing themselves for beads. Yeah, well we better be careful or Allison's going to wonder what you did to get those beads. There she is. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: That cannot be my favorite niece. Oh, look at you. Holy cow, is this what a year in Italy does? Mom says I remind her of you. Oh, well she's flattering me. She must want something. She misses you. She doesn't like being so far away. Don't you tell her I said that. - No, of course. I'll use it as ammunition. I hear your dads assignment went well. Yeah, how's you new job? Well it's better than practicing law, but today was not a good day. Doesn't matter come on. I finagled us a place at Madam El's. What's Madam El's? MATT AND ALLISON: What's Madam El's? This is where I met Allison. [music playing] Who is he? You don't even recognize him? You used to play with him when you lived here. You took a bath with him at my house when you were three years old. CINDY EVERS: Dalton Tramble? ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Yes, I ran into his parents the other day and he was asking about you and I told him we'd stop by. He's gorgeous. ELDERLY WOMAN: Hey, you have a spectacular butt. Come on, let's dance. [phone ringing] Are you expecting someone? It's probably mom checking up on me. Wait, wait. Let me. Madeleine, hi. How are you? I'm fine. No, Cindy I haven't seen her since she landed. No, I think she said she was going down to Bourbon street to lift her shirt for beads. Madeline, she's right here. Cut her some slack. She's 18. She's on vacation. No, she's not going to leave the phone on. She'll call you if anything good happens. Say hi to Norm. You are incredible. You have good parents. I think they've just been married too long to remember what fun is. So do you think you guys are gonna get married? Well, that's the $64,000 question, isn't it? I guess the answer is I'd like to. You don't think Matt wants to? No, I think he does. He just needs more time. CINDY EVERS: Guys have been together for as long as I can remember. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Yup, we're going on seven years. Do you talk about it? Probably not as much as we should. MATT ANDREWS: Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I needed this. Good day, huh? Never forget the look on that woman's face. I can't imagine losing someone like that. Do they know what caused the collapse? Some kind of sinkhole. Oh, is wasn't a sinkhole. You need limestone for a sinkhole. We got heat, mud, and clay back here. That's it. Well, whatever it was it was awful. I'm glad it's over. Here everyone's health. So you'll dance with other women, but you won't dance with me? Let's go. MOTHER: So how was your piano class? DAUGHTER: Very good. And did you learn any new songs. Hey, diddle diddle. - Oh, I love that one. - I know. That's great. We'll have to practice when we get home, OK? - Yup, I can't wait. - In you get. Buckle up. OK, is that thing sticking again? No, I got it. Good. My seat belt. Come on, you got to push. Mommy, mommy. It's OK. Up you get. OK, go, go. [car alarm] [music playing] [phone ringing] Allison, your phone. Allison Beauchamp. Beauchamp. REPORTER: Do you know if this has any connection to today's tragedy in Deveaux Park GEORGE REGAN: Well, it's early to say, but we don't believe it does. No, right now we're just thankful that there were no serious injuries and obviously that's our primary concern. I will keep you posted as things develop. You can be assured of that. Something been burning? WORKER: Not that I know of. I got a rock in my office. Smells exactly the same way from down by the freeway. Find anything like when the tower collapsed? No, why do you think there's some relation? Well, it could be a broken water main or drainage pipe cause that. That's two holes are miles apart. That'd be a coincidence. Try Jesse Snow over at the university. No, I called. He's at a conference in China. Well, how about Chako John? He's there too. Now Matt, you've got a contract with us. No, no, no, no. Not for this kind of field work, Frank. I'm a lab nerd now. I'll send you out that rock. REPORTER: For the second time in 24 hours [inaudible] has been struck by what appears to be-- I thought sinkholes only occurred in limestone. Yeah, so did I. What's going on? Oh, looking for somebody to head up an investigation. Why can't you? MATT ANDREWS: It's not what I do. Yeah, it is what you do. Not anymore. Well, so who are they going to get? Frank will get somebody. I think they need somebody right away. If you won't do it for Frank, will you do it for me? No thanks. There are two million people in town Matt. This is my responsibility. It's not your responsibility. Yes, public works is a department that I oversee. If there is a connection between that tunnel collapse downtown and this huge hole, then I need to know it's not going to happen again and jeopardize all those people. I like this job. I want to do it well and keep it. GEORGE REGAN: Call me at my office, Donna. At my office, at my office. Thank you. Matt, I've been telling the vultures that we don't think this is connected to that tunnel collapse. Please tell me that's true. Is that a political or a geological opinion, George? I was hoping somebody like you could make it both. MATT ANDREWS: I'll let you know what I find. GEORGE REGAN: All right, good night. All right, I'll talk to Frank. I'll see you when I get home. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Thank you. Tomorrow I promise we'll be way more fun. CINDY EVERS: Look if you need to work I'm fine. I don't, I don't. In fact, I have a very special appointment tomorrow at 11 o'clock. It's a surprise. We should go home and get some sleep. JIMMY GUTRO: What exactly is it we're looking for? Remember this? Exactly what was in the other hole. CINDY EVERS: What is this? Oh my god. That's Ken Gordon Jr. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: I know. You Cindy Evers are going to be on the main float of the dying geese's crew parade on Mardi Gras eve. Ken Gordon Jr. and Dalton Tramble. DALTON: Hey. There he is. Wow, you look incredible. Really? Yes, really. Am I totally ridiculous or what? Not totally. Yeah, great thanks. They're not sure if I'm supposed to be Gabriel, or Raphael, or one of those other guys. MAN VOICE: Hey, Dalton. I'm coming just a minute. Hey listen, tonight's the only night I'm playing while you're in town. Thought if you don't already have plans maybe we could get together. You like jazz? Yeah. Yeah, I'll take you to real stuff. Places even Allison doesn't know. What? - I'll pick you up at eight, OK? - Great. Bye. Let's get you to that fitting. How far? WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Matt. Hang on, yeah. WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Allison and her niece are here. Send them down. Hank, give me the address of the smoke. OK, all right, OK. Thanks Hanks. Hey, come here. Sorry to put the brakes on your day. That's OK. What's up? I've got something I want you to see. OK, now a normal sinkhole forms went underground water dissolves limestone leaves space. Right, water recedes. Sometimes that space is so big it can't support its own roof. Roof collapses, you got a sinkhole. Right, it can sometimes be a couple of yards across or a couple of hundred yards across. Oh my god. And deep. OK, now New Orleans sits on layer of silt, a layer of peat, and layer clay. Last summer it was abnormally hot. We had two big peat fires here and here where these red X's are. OK, now the fire was contained to the naked eye, but peats weird. It can smolder underground indefinitely. In the fall, where these blue is are we had 16 reports of smoke coming up from small cracks in the ground. But these look like they're miles from the peat fires. MATT ANDREWS: Oh, they are. When public works investigated they couldn't find anything because the smoldering had moved on and frankly they didn't look deep. Because if they had they would have found caverns and channels of burn out. When the torrential rains came through in the wintertime, it washed through these spaces that eroded the silt and the clay. Water disappears you got big empty spaces equivalent to sink holes. Where are the two sinkholes on this map? MATT ANDREWS: Here and here. The ones that have opened up. Others they could be anywhere under the city. And they can just collapse like these ones without any warning? Terrain is exactly the same. You'd have to be a fool to think it wouldn't. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: So what're you saying? One of those floats down there could drop into one of these holes at any second? MATT ANDREWS: That's a possibility, yes. You got two million people extra in this city on a pound per square foot basis. That's a lot of extra stress, especially in the French Quarter. GEORGE REGAN: People have been crowding the parades in quarter for over a week already. You got two hoes that opened up in 24 hours. Surely we can wait three more days until the end of Mardi Gras. Look you don't know if you got an hour or a century with whats down there. SPEAKER 1: I don't think that this poses a serious threat, I really don't. - How do we find this out? I want to sweep the city with ground penetrating radar. I want to do some resistivity tests. SPEAKER 1: You can't sweep the city. We don't have near the equipment for that. SAM: Exactly. SPEAKER 1: Even if we did, we wouldn't be done until Christmas. Look Matt, we are talking urban terrain here, pavement, pipe. We got 90 miles of drainage too. Don't worry about the equipment. I can get that. John, under the French Quarter parade route there's drainage tunnels. I can go in. Then I can map the rest from the street. In the meantime until we know what's down there? Close down the areas with the greatest stress. [interposing voices] SAM: This is Mardi Gras. Fat Tuesday, that means you can't have it on a Wednesday, or a Friday, and you certainly can't not have it at all. You know I mean Mardi Gras is New Orleans. It is the French Quarter. People come from miles around. You know what? They booked their hotel rooms a year in advance. You can't get a flight in or out of the city for days. We have a riot on our hands. Well Sam, you might have a bigger problem than that on your hands. GEORGE REGAN: OK, OK. I think we've heard what Matt has to say and I think we should talk it over. MATT ANDREWS: Excuse me. Wait, I think Matt should get whatever equipment and men he needs, and get down there and find out what's going on now. I think that's a good idea. Thank you, John. GEORGE REGAN: With all due respect to Allison, Matt's reputation is that he's been a bit gun shy, a bit overcautious since his Angel Valley mining collapse. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: It wasn't his mining collapse. He was absolved of all responsibility in that. GEORGE REGAN: Oh, I know, but I've heard it's taken a toll on him in all areas of his life and I think we should consider if that's having some effect here now. Look you asked for his professional advice and he gave it to us. I think we should accept it for what it's worth, which is a lot. And I guess you're in the best position to assess that. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: OK gentlemen, I'm supposed to be judging this parade. Allison, I want you to talk to the city department heads, and the Mardi Gras committee, and come up with a recommendation by noon tomorrow, and that's the recommendation I will take. What'd you find? REMY: We're not seeing anything out of the ordinary here, Matt. Any spaces we have the roofs seem totally in tact and any surface crack we found seem to have been there for years. Come on. There's more I want to check. CO-WORKER 2: We thought you said keep going over to L5, Matt. MATT ANDREWS: No, that's not what I said. I said, Larry and Hal go to L5. The rest you guys go straight. What do you got? It's stable. Nothing. All right, let's go east. What's that quarter? That was L3. MATT ANDREWS: Give me a hand. MARCELLUS: Hey, Dr. Geology. Hey, Marcellus. I don't here no harmonica playing coming up through the vents no more. They say Smiley got killed over at Deveaux Park, but now I see men coming out of man holes everywhere. What's going on man? Just making sure everything's safe. I've been playing these streets all my life man. You're gonna tell me if there's somewhere I shouldn't be, ain't you? I'll let you know when I know, Marcellus. You the man. Nothing. Nothing, let's move east. GEORGE REGAN: We're confident there's nothing to threaten anyone's safety or disrupt any festivities. When we know more we'll let you know. Until that time I have no further comment. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. What's up? JIMMY GUTRO: I'm looking for Al or Matt. GEORGE REGAN: Al's down below. Matt's off doing surveys all night. What do you need? JIMMY GUTRO: It's the French Quarter. Look, this is pavement. This is the building foundation. This store owner who took it said it happened yesterday. It's all in the report. I'll get those down to Al. JIMMY GUTRO: You'll give them to him? Yeah, I'll take care of it. All right. Oh, you scared me. Sorry I guess it's just you and me. I'm just looking over these evacuation studies. GEORGE REGAN: I was just on my way out. I thought you might want to take a look at this. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: What is it? It's about Pete. It says that air pockets, sometimes big ones, are pretty common and don't usually prejudice the ground above them. It says burnings common too. But not for marsh fires miles away, but from spontaneous combustion. It also says that radar stuff Matt was talking about is only so reliable on city terrain. Where did you get this? GEORGE REGAN: Public works. Spent the afternoon with the engineers. Why wasn't I given it immediately? They just got it to me. The kind of disaster Matt's talking about would be terrible. Engineers think that the possibility of anything happening at all is remote, much less before the end of Mardi Gras. And is that a chance you want to take? Absolutely not. I don't think we should jump the gun the other way. I mean we're talking about a huge social and economic impact here. Our guests spend close to a billion dollars in two weeks. If we interrupt Mardi Gras without a damn good reason, well that can be very bad come election time. I'd hate to see us flush that down some abyss that might not even exist. Anyway, let me know if you need anything. Good night. Good night. WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Matt, Allison wants you to call as soon as you've correlated the results. Did you get that, Matt? Get two beers. Coke. BARTENDER: Coming right up. CINDY EVERS: Thank you. DALTON: Thanks. Oh, I got something to show you. Where did you get this? Look at my hair. I took it years ago. And you've had it this whole time? Yeah. Really? I never even thought you noticed me. I used to do things so that you would. Like what? Twisting my ankle outside of Laforge's garage. I knew that wasn't real. I for sure, oh man. Do you want to go down to a table? Yeah. PSYCHIC: Hold on tight. Voodoo. Really creepy, huh? You OK? Yeah. MATT ANDREWS: OK, this is much as I can map from the tunnels and the streets. All right, the burning comes in this way and this way from the marshes. All right, the peats pockmark with channels. They converge they slope this way. To me that says there's a large hole right here. Somewhere in the French Quarter, under the Canal Street, parade route. It's right here. I can't pinpoint it with the equipment I got. It's too deep. How long till it collapses? MATT ANDREWS: That's impossible to say, Ally. I don't know. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: More than three days? Three centuries. I've got to do some further exploring. I don't know. Well there must be some signs that we'd see. What do you want to crack pavement? You want a building slipping off its foundation? It's a sinkhole. It's catastrophic. When it goes it caves in. All right, we're below sea level here. The levee ruptures, you know what's going to happen? Matt, I need-- there has to be some way to know. Well, I'm gonna certify it class four. What is class four? Unsafe till further exploration. Well, the Mardi Gras committee and the city council meet first thing in the morning, and I need as much information as possible then. I'll bring it home later. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Yes. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: We just finished up 10 minutes ago. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: I heard the meeting was lively. That's an understatement. My recommendation. You want to tell me what it is? Based on everything I've reviewed, I think we should go ahead with Mardi Gras as planned. If anything changes that I'll let you know. Good. REMY: What the hell? They sealed it up with concrete. Who authorized this? ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: They don't dispute your data. It's your interpretation. My interpretation, well that's the safest thing under the circumstances. Wait a second, you asked me to come on board. I thought it was because you trusted me. I do trust you. Then why are those holes filled with cement because I need them for my investigation. They're a public hazard. Public hazards downtown, Ally. Matt, the guy's in engineering think you're being too cautious. They said that your own data shows that the roofs of the caverns are strong enough to hold-- The roofs of the caverns I know about are fine. It's the ones I don't know about. You got two million people down there jumping up and down. It's probably disintegrating right now as we speak. But you don't know that honey. I don't know that. I don't know how big they are. I don't know how deep it is. I don't know what's down there under the parade route and the quarter. It's a geological anomaly, Ally. Nobody knows anything. When nobody knows anything, there's no such thing as being too cautious. Come on, Ally. Who's the man you're listening too? George Reagan, maybe? He's listening to me. I'm the one who told him that he should let things go ahead. Unbelievable. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: But that was based on my best judgment of all the information that I was provided from you, from engineering, from the Mardi Gras committee, and the-- The Mardi Gras committee? That's the Chamber of Commerce, Ally. What are you trying to prove to the mayor? This is not about proving myself, Matt. Oh, what's it about? You put Cindy on a float because the Mardi Gras committee says it's OK. Do you think for a second I would put Cindy in a parade if I thought there was any real danger? Engineering has been on this day and night just like you have. They have found no signs, Matt. Nothing, no radar readings, no slick buildings, no cracks in the pavement, nothing. You kidding me? You've got two sinkholes and a dead body out there. They're miles away. I can't call off Mardi Gras just because you refuse to stop living at Angel Valley. What? You didn't kill those men, Matt. In that mine they were using explosives they knew nothing about, and nobody hold you responsible. Nobody, not the government, not the shareholders, not even their own families. Nobody except you. Your baby stepping through life because you think that you could have done something to stop it. They were greedy. They were greedy. Nobody could have stopped them and now you tell clients to lay foundations 30% deeper than code. You rate things class four when other people rate it class two, and you do it with everything. You rate me class four. Unsafe until further exploration. Aren't you guys engaged yet, Ally? When are you guys getting married? Well, we're waiting to make sure everything's right. I've known everything was right for seven years and it's getting really lonely. Morning. Remy. Just when I thought I was going to get some sleep. OK, I can't find a drainage tunnel maps. What are you looking for? MATT ANDREWS: I want to get down in there with a drill crew. REMY: Drill crew, what for? I want to see what's in that cavern to see what's really there. You've got to be kidding. You're not kidding. All right boys, cavern 86 that's the smallest one. It should be right here under the tunnel. It's the only way in. Let's go. You know city's not going to like this. I live with the city, Remy. ANNOUNCER: Angel float we're ready to rumble. Can we have the angels please? CINDY EVERS: OK, Allison I'll see you there. I got to go. I'm so excited. Bye. DALTON: You ready? Yeah. Good. Wow, you look stunning. Thank you. Shall we? REMY: We're through. OK, feed it. MATT ANDREWS: Whats it look like? REMY: Big black hole. JIMMY GUTRO: What's that? MATT ANDREWS: Interdirectional C4. And what's it for? You never know. REMY: Just be careful. OK. Am I hot? REMY: You're hot. OK, I'm down. They didn't channel F2. REMY: He's heading toward the parade route. His depths increasing. Channel F2's walls and floor are dry. Ceilings in tact like the others. Channel sloping down. I think I'm in F3, Remy. You want to confirm that? REMY: Confirmed. OK, I'm gonna mark it. I hear noise up ahead. Rocks are falling. He's almost under the parade route. Oh my god. Remy, you getting this? Cindy, Cindy, Cindy. Hey, throw me one. You look great. Thanks. GEORGE REGAN: Well so far no floats dropping off into sinkholes. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: No. Guess we'll get this taken care of after tomorrow if there is anything to take care of. You made the right decision, Allison. I hope so. You should thank me. For what? My help. I based my decision on the information you gave me. Yeah, but without me you might have made the wrong decision. Don't discount me because you think you have the Mayor's ear, Allison. We're both young and smart, and you wave that fancy law degree around, but that's a rat's ass compared to experience. You really think I would have let you cancel this? What are you trying to tell me, George? The Mayor surrounds himself with good people, but don't think that makes you indispensable. There's a reason he lets someone else make his decisions for him. There's a reason I do too. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Allison Beauchamp. Come one. REMY: I got It. Did you get Allison? She's already on her way to the quarter. REMY: There's been a balcony collapse on Bourbon Street. Come on, move that stuff. Get it out of here. Come on, come on. Coming through. I got my credentials. I got them right here. Ally, what happened? What are you doing here? What happened? There were too many people on the balcony. Too many people on the balcony? This wasn't here two days ago. Ally, I've been down there. I've seen it. It's 60 feet deep. This is the eastern edge. It runs all along the parade route like I thought. I got it all on video camera. You got to get these people out of here. It's crumbling by the second. Hey, get them out of here now. OK. Get back to the fire chief yet, and I want you to get all the emergency rooms and paramedics standing by. I need a list of every celebrity and major contributor on those floats. Yes, this is the Mayor's office. I need to get a message Ken Gordon Jr. immediately. JEN: Here and Susan Rosner from FEMA on line four. Jen, can you find out whose coordinating the Dionysus parade and get them on the line for me? I need to get my niece off that float right away. This is Allison Beauchamp. Hi Susan, we're working on an evacuation plan right now. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: How the hell do we stop this? MATT ANDREWS: Well if we can it's with this. It's polyurethane gel. When it his the air it erupts hundreds of times its natural volume, and when it solidifies it's like hard Styrofoam. I don't know that yet. MATT ANDREWS: We can fill the cavity with it. I have somebody looking for enough right now, but you got to get those people out first. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Can the stampede trigger a collapse? MATT ANDREWS: Anything's possible. If you can move the people out evenly from the center. SPEAKER 2: They're all gonna riot. ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Then let's use riot gear. SPEAKER 2: How close in can you get units without adding to the stress? ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: The more units in the area, the more congested it'll be. People have trouble getting out. SPEAKER 2: We'll use the choppers. Matt. Yeah, It'll be OK. How many foot and mounted are in the area now? Over a 1,000. We're standing by for evacuation. I'm gonna pull all the units I've got. MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: George, I want the media under tight control. I'm on it. Allison, you are in charge. The governments on board. Do what you have to, but just get us out of this. Sir, I feel fully responsible for this situation. You made your best decision under the circumstances. Just get the people out of there.
