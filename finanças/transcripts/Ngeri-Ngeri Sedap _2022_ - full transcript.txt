Having to lower my lifestyle Is okay for me But my children have to excel Among their peers I work day and night So my children can go to school As hard as I can I can do literally anything To survive this life So that my children can reach their dreams My children are my wealth Horas! -Horas! -Horas! Sit down. Come sit down. Where have you been? I was taking care of a land dispute in Medan. How was it? Thank God I sent Hotman to law school. He was my lawyer for the case. We won! That's great! This man over here is the role model of parenting! That's right. He's great. -Just try it. -No, I can't. Brother, that's your son, Gabe. Come on. Change the station. It's embarrassing. But he's really cool! He's a famous comedian! Satisfied now? Aren't they the same? Gabe and Hotman? -They both went to law school. -Right. Is it okay if he doesn't make use of his degree? His job now is just temporary. He wants to be a judge or an attorney. He will stop with comedy anytime soon. What do you mean stop? You can't tell me to stop like I'm some public vehicle. Your dad doesn't approve of you becoming a comedian. Then, why does he like to joke around? What do you mean? He likes to tell people what to do with their lives. That's just funny. Everyone will laugh at him. Your dad said if you keep saying no, you can't go back home. See? That's funny, right? He threatened me like I'm a kid. What if I get this comedy skill from his blood? Gabe is still talking. By the way, is Domu still in Bandung? Yes. I heard that he's marrying a Sundanese woman. Are you okay with that? If his wife doesn't come from the Batak family, how will she respect our tradition? That's just a rumor. That's impossible. Domu is my first son. He carries the responsibility of our family. He has to marry a Batak woman. Why do I have to do that, Mom? Batak or Sunda, we're all humans. You're our first son. You will carry our family name. You will carry our tradition. How will you carry the responsibility if your wife doesn't understand our tradition? But we live in a modern world now, Mom. People can live without tradition. Domu, remember. You are Batak. So, what do we do now? You two won't meet her? I want to marry her. You go talk to him now. You do it. Your dad said, let alone meet her and introduce each other, he doesn't even want to see you if you keep saying no. Okay, then, I don't want to see him too. It's just formality. Calm down. He hung up. What do we do now? Your youngest son… -What about him? -You mean Sahat? He's in Yogyakarta. -He graduated already, right? -He's not coming back here? As Batak people, we don't send our youngest kid to other cities. They should be home taking care of their parents. Sahat has promised us to go back home, but he still needs to take care of something. He'll come home when he wraps up everything. I need more time. I started a business and I have to take care of Mr. Pomo. Why do you have to do that? He doesn't have any kids and his wife has already passed away. But you promised us to go back home after you finished your studies. You are our youngest child. I know, Mom. But I have no choice. If we knew you would do this, we wouldn't have allowed you to study so far away. Anyway, you have to go home as soon as possible. And you can't go anywhere. But-- -Honey. You're so selfish. -Forget it. Sir. So, Sarma stays in the house? Right. She takes care of me and my wife. Thankfully, she works as a civil servant in the subdistrict, so she doesn't have to go far away. SARMAPURBA, SECOND CHILD CIVIL SERVANT, TOBA Mom, here's the chili sauce. -Here, Dad. -Looks good. Thank you, sweetie. Why is she not married yet? It's okay for daughters to marry first, right? She just haven't met the one. Let's just pray for her. I admire you. Your children are successful. They don't humiliate their parents. Not like Mr. Sianipar. He keeps fighting with his children, so none of the children wants to go back home. A real chaos over there! -Honey, aren't you coming home? It's late. -Okay, honey, I know. Okay, just wait. I'm coming home. -I'll get going. -Okay. My wife is impatient. We understand. It's better to respond to the wife's call. If we keep postponing it, they'll come to get us. You'll be dead meat! -I'm off. -Go take care of your wife. Technology is indeed useful. There's no need for anyone at home to come to pick us. Honey. The technology is indeed advanced but not with the people. Okay, then, you guys continue. I'm off. Now, it's your turn to take care of your wife. You two are the same. WARNING: SMOKING KILLS I told you already. Don't come to pick me up. It's embarrassing. Like I'm a kid getting picked up from school. We need to go to your mom's house. It's better if you didn't go to the tavern. It's embarrassing for me to pick you up too. Like I'm a teacher picking up some kids. So, how was it? Have you talked to the kids about the ceremony for their grandmother? I've told Sarma to call them. But they still don't want to go home. It's their grandmother, for God's sake. My own mother. Honey. I've cried so many times. I said I miss them and I asked them to go home. They still said no. And I am their own mother. What do we do with our children now? They really won't come home. I really can't understand. You don't? You're crazy to say that! Honey, hold my hand. -What do you-- -Hold my hand. It's important. Horas! Horas, Priest. Horas! Horas, Priest. It's such a beautiful sight to see you two. Look how intimate you are even in this old age. It was a good decision to pick you as role model for the church congregation. You're flattering. Where are you going? We're heading to my mother in law's house. We want to discuss the marriage affirmation ceremony. It's only a week away. I see. Okay, then, you get going. I'll pray for you so that everything goes smoothly. Thank you, Priest. -I'm off. -Okay. I told you not to say no. See? It's good. It's good for our family's name. So… regarding to the ceremony expenses, we're 50 millions short. Do you have anything to say? Domu's father, how much can you provide? Well, Uncle, what if we collect the money from my siblings first? I will cover the rest. See you, Brother. See you, Uncle. What's wrong, Mom? Son. What about my grandchildren? Are they coming? Yes, they are coming. No matter how big this ceremony is, no matter how much money you give to our family, if my grandchildren won't come, everything is in vain. Even the name of the ceremony is "Feeding the Grandchildren". And they are my grandchildren. Why don't you believe me, Mom? Sarma said you are fighting with your sons. Don't worry, Mom. I'll make sure they all are coming. Son. Be kind to your children. I know. It's been a while and you are still sulking. How can I not be? You spent that much money and you didn't even care to tell me. If I told you, you would say no and you would still sulk. It's just the same. It's better this way. -Honey. -What? What can we do so our sons want to come home? You should apologize to them. Are you out of your mind? If I apologize, that will be a green light for all their decisions. So, what do you want? I have to make them come home and come to their grandmother's ceremony. So we can save our face and so I can talk to them directly. If I talk to them directly, they would listen. They won't fight with me. You're really looking for trouble, huh? You like to fight that much, don't you? Honey. Help me. We have to find a way to persuade them? I told you, we fly to Java, meet them in person, and ask them to come home. But we are the parents. Why would we beg them to come? That'll hurt my pride. If so, then let me go on my own. I already said no. I don't care about what you want. I just miss my children. I haven't seen Domu for six years, Gabe for four years, and Sahat for three years. Everything is because of you. You set us apart. Why are you blaming me? So, you really think you're not wrong? What did I do wrong? I just want the best for our family. I always do my best for my family. So, you want me to stay silent seeing my sons making the wrong decisions? You're right. You're always right. I know. You agree if Domu marries that Sundanese woman and if Gabe keeps doing comedy and if Sahat who is supposed to take care of us is now taking care of someone else? -I don't agree with them. -Then, you said I'm the wrong one? Let's just stop. You really like to fight with anyone. Do you think if we fight like this our sons would come home? Honey. Honey. -I know. -What? If we pretend that we are fighting and getting divorced, they'll definitely come home. You're really out of your mind. If they know their parents are getting divorced and they still won't come home, then your sons are the ones losing their minds. No, I don't want to. I won't lie to my children. You said you miss them. Don't you want to see them? Just imagine Domu, Gabe, and Sahat are all home. You will be happy, right? You only need to do what I say. But if they know we're lying, it's on you. Don't you dare blame me. I'll eat first, then, you follow me. We'll fight in front of her. Fight about what? I don't know. Just counter everything I say, then you ask for a divorce. -What did you cook this time? -It's tombur fish. Here. Here's the fish. I'll get you water. Come here! Here, Dad. -Sweetie. -Yes? So, you're still alive? I thought you were dead. How could you? That's not funny. You're the funny one. And old woman get up at this hour. So what if I'm an old woman? You get up at this hour too sometimes. So, it's okay for an old man? It's okay for men. Old women should take care of the house. It's so easy for you men. You can do whatever you want. Then you can become a man. You're out of your mind. -You are! -You are! Long time ago. -You! -You! -You! -You! Dad. Mom. Sorry for interrupting. I'm late. I have to go. -Take care. -Okay, Mom. You're really not good at this. It took you so long to be angry. You should have mentioned "divorce" right away. So soon? -We had to fight first. -I initiated the fight. You do that every day. But I never mentioned divorce even once. No wonder Sarma didn't say anything. It's normal for her to see us fight. That's why I couldn't mention "divorce" out of nowhere. I have to be really angry. Is there anything that makes you angry with me? -A lot! -Huh? There are a lot of things. I know. Just tell me one. It's when you go home past midnight from the lapo. Honey. Honey. I told you already. Hold your anger. I'll wake Sarma first. I will knock on the front door. Then you can be angry with me. What? -You're crazy! -No, it's you! You have no manners. Why don't you stay out there? I told you already. If it's past midnight, don't you dare to go home. Don't you remember? Why can't I go home? This is my house. What do you mean your house? This is my house too. We live in this house together. Follow the rules! Your house? The letters are under my name! Just live by yourself if you can't follow the rules! Okay! I can live by myself! What do you mean? You want us to separate? -What if I say yes? -Okay, then, just divorce me! Sarma, tell your brothers that your dad and I want a divorce! Quick! Okay, Mom. What happened, Sarma? Mom and Dad are fighting. Mom asked him for a divorce. Is that true? If it was not true, I wouldn't call you this late. So, what do we do? Don't worry. There's no point in their marriage anyway. Hey, dimwit! Watch your mouth! There's no divorce in the Batak tradition. It's not only about tradition. There isn't divorce in Christianity either. Sarma, just talk to Mom. If they have problems, just talk it out and find a solution. So, you guys won't go home to solve this? You won't say anything? It's a huge problem. Just keep thinking about yourselves! You don't even care about our family! It's not like that. Just give them time. Maybe they were being emotional. If things get too serious, we can talk again. Go to the kitchen and let Sarma know. Then you walk away and wait on the roadside. If anyone asks, just make up something. Don't mention divorce. It's humiliating. What if Sarma doesn't run after me? She will. I'm sure of it. Where are you going, Mom? I'm just nothing in this house. My husband and children are so selfish. I still have a family. For my mom, I'm precious. Mom. It's bad! Mom left the house! -Where to? -To her mother's house! -It's bad. -Bad? Why? If mom is leaving the house to go back to her parents' house, it means she really wants the divorce. If we want Mom to come home, by tradition, Dad has to pick her up with his family. -How long has she been gone? -She went just now. Then, run after her. Wait. Mom. Your sons want to talk. Mom, don't leave. Don't act like you care! Mom, but we're your sons. We can talk it out. Just don't leave. Right, Mom. We can find a way out. We'll go back home tomorrow. I can't. I have a schedule. Forget it. You guys are too busy. Let me go back to my mom's house. -Gabe, don't be stupid! -Okay, Mom. Just go back to our house. -We'll come home tomorrow. -Right, Mom. Just go back home. Okay, Mom? -Horas! -Horas, sir! Where are you going? My daughter is going to work. -Okay, wweetie, time to go. -I'm heading to work, Mom. -Excuse me, sir. -Okay. -Sweetie, your bag. -Okay. You forgot this. It's the files for her work. -Right, sweetie? -Yes, Mom. -Excuse me, sir. -Okay. Time passes so quickly and the kids have grown up. -Right. -When they get older, they're usually against us, but your kids are different. They're so mature. Now, excuse me, ma'am. Take care, sir. How was it? They are all coming home tomorrow. See? What did I tell you? If you just do what I say, everything will work out just fine. Right. You're really the best! Everything works according to your plans. Toba Lake is also here thanks to you. Where's Mom? I don't know. Maybe she's drowned in the lake. I'm off, Dad. Take care, sweetie. I just played along. It's the same for me. I played along too. But you hit me for real. -Dear, can I go with you? -No, you don't need to. It'll just make things worse. But you will come back here, right? It's not about your wedding plans, right? Listen. We have gone too far to go back. Don't disappoint Neny. I won't disappoint her. It's really about my family. And I have zero doubts about our wedding. My dad has paid for the wedding venue. If you want to run away, please pay us back. We spent a good amount for the venue, right, honey? I even put my jewelry in a mortgage. It would be heartless for you to run away. Please drink. Drink. Drink to calm you down. What if I can't go back here? It's okay. The most important is you go back to your home. Your parents need you. "Urip iku urup". What does it mean? "Urip" means our life. "Urup" means fiery or shining. It means our lives have to illuminate other's lives. The most important thing is, wherever you are, you have to be useful to others. Okay? CIRCUS Ready? Don't sulk. Look at him sulking! GIMMICK, MISSING YOUR DAD -I'm crying. -It's windy here. Gabe, you like to ride bike since you were little? -With your dad? -Right! Do you miss your dad? Just say yes, like in other programs. -I miss my dad. -Okay, now we call Gabe's dad! Please step out, sir. Hello, Gabe, my son. Please, miss. This is urgent for my family. Just for two days, okay? Please, I beg you. Miss Dinda, please. Okay, two days. Not more! Okay, I promised. You're uncomfortable, right? You should listen to Dad. Don't be a comedian so people won't recognize you. Since people don't recognize you, why don't you listen to Dad? It's convenient that the aiport is closer to our home. Right, so you won't have any excuse not to go home. It's good that you go back often. Brothers! Brothers! I miss you so much, Domu. Gabe! My celebrity brother! Sahat! It seems like not long ago I changed your diapers and now you have pubic hair. How was the trip? You haven't seen each other for long. It must be fun. You must have been missing each other. It's fun, really fun. My big brothers are really close to each other. I'm so happy that we can be together. But I'm confused. Should I be happy or sad that our parents are fighting? Don't look that happy. They won't believe you asked me for a divorce. So, what do we have to do next? What can we do so they stay here until Mom's ceremony? Just follow what I say. We need to make them stay as long as possible. I know, but how? Just wait and see. Well, I'll give you some codes. If my finger is on my mouth, then you speak and counter everything I say. If my finger is on my eye, you cry. Other than that, just stay silent. Remember, you have to be cold towards them! I know! Show them that you are dealing with some problems! I know! I get it! Please don't let others know about this problem. I don't want people to talk about it. So, what's the plan? We need to make them up. How? I only got two days off. I have to go back tomorrow. Let's just finish everything quickly. Tonight, everyone has to sit together, we talk about the problems, and we find a way other than divorce. But you guys have to remember, we want to solve their problem. Don't make things worse. Know to control yourselves, okay? Mom. Mom. Mom. My sons. I miss you so much. Gabe. Domu. Sahat. I miss you. So, you're all here? So, you're all successful until you forgot who helped you to be this successful. Domu, Gabe, Sahat, let's eat. What about Dad? Dad. Dad. Let's eat. I'm going to eat at the lapo. Your mother didn't invite me to dinner. Come on. Eat with us. You didn't put any poison in my food, did you? Don't be like that, Dad. Maybe she can't wait to live as a widow. Lead the prayer. Before we eat, let's pray. Thank you, God, for bringing us together this day. Bless the food our mother has prepared for us, so everyone who eats it are all healthy and won't die. Amen. It's safe now, Dad. Your gomak noodles are so good, Mom. Your cooking is the best in the world. No match! But even her cooking can't make you go home, right? What? No, I just wanted to give you a drink. It's just typical for the first child. The most filial to the parents. Do we need more time? I want to go to the lapo. Well… You must know why we're here. I have to go back to Jakarta tomorrow. So, we must wrap everything up tonight. What do you mean "wrap everything up"? What's the problem? How could you two think of divorce? Dad, just apologize to Mom. Why me? Dad, you don't want to divorce her, do you? Of course not. It's embarrassing if we divorce. Then, apologize to Mom, Dad. Or tell us what's the problem so we know what's going on. Just ask her. She initiated the divorce. So, what's the problem, Mom? Tell us, Mom. A lot! I have a lot of problems! Tell us, so we can find a way out together. Mom. If you're not ready, let's talk about it tomorrow. There, there. I'm going to the lapo. We can't pin them against each other. She can't handle pressure very well. What if we talk to them separately? Maybe Dad first or Mom first. Just don't put them in one room. I don't think this house is the right place. We need to find a new place with a new vibe, just to change the mood. Let's just take them for a walk. If we make them happy, maybe they'll open up. Okay, let's do it tomorrow morning. Maybe they'll make up that way so I can go back to Jakarta tomorrow night. One, two, three! You're really different Your dad is also different Your whole family is different You're really different Your mom is also different Your whole family is different One more time! You're really different Your dad is also different Your whole family is different You're really different Your mom is also different Your whole family is different Your whole family is different Don't yell! You'll wake the kids up! Tomorrow they're taking us for a walk. What will we do? Look at you. You look so happy. Every parent is happy to see their kids, except for you. Why are they taking us for a walk? They want to talk to us, separately. So, now what? When they ask you to go with them, just say no first. Don't just agree with them. Mom, wake up. Let's go for a walk. -I can't go. -Come on. Come on. I'll wait outside. Let's go for a walk. Sahat, you sit at the back. -Can you do it? -Yes. Sarma. Sarma! Let me sit there! -Sweetie. -If they play us, we play them back. -Let me do what I want! -Let me do what I want! -Let me do what I want! -Let me do what I want! -Move! -You move! -Move! -You move! Let me squeeze in. Just act natural during the walk. Don't look too happy. Toba Lake is beautiful, right? So, this is the famous Toba Lake? This is the first time I have seen the lake. The view is quite nice. The view is beautiful, isn't it? Nothing special about it. But it looks beautiful because I see it with you guys. How can you think about divorce? If they ask you about the divorce, just change the topic. Hey. You don't want to take pictures? The view is great. Come on. Don't just sit around. How could you think about divorce? Aren't you guys hungry? Why don't you eat? What did you do? Mom is sad. What did "I" do? So, you are so sure that I'm wrong? So I'm the devil and she's the angel? What did he do? You've looked troubled for so long. Your dad keeps setting us apart. I don't agree with you. I don't like your decisions and your choices. But that's not the right way. We are family and it's impossible to follow only what you want. I know you only love your mother. I've never done anything for you. I never fought to raise you. I've never worked hard for your studies. I have never done anything. That's why you guys don't care about what I want. We are Batak. There is no "divorce" in our language. So, now you care about our tradition? Is marrying a person outside of our people accepted by our tradition? By our tradition, is it okay for the last child to not take care of his parents? Is it honored by our tradition to be a comedian? For him, traditions stand above feelings. One more thing. I forgot. You guys also prioritize the traditions and not your feelings. Talk to her. Your mom just copies what you do. She doesn't listen to me. She blames me for everything. Tell me. When you guys have a problem with your dad, do you talk to him? So, what do we do now? I also have things to take care of. We need to solve this problem. If you are cornered, just mention the divorce so they'll stop. I thought you brought us here for a picnic, but if you care about yourselves more, just go home. I also want to see my mom so badly. -Mom, let's just take pictures. -Let's take some pictures. Gabe, let's use your phone. It has a good camera, right? So, what do you want, Dad? I have no choice. She wants a divorce. Let her do it. This time, I'll do what she says. Let me tell her. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Let's eat. Grandma is here. Don't let your grandma know about this. -Horas, Mom. -Horas, son. Why didn't you tell me that my grandchildren are here? -Grandma. -Domu! Gabe! Sahat! Sorry, Mom. -I didn't tell you-- -You don't need to explain. I know already. Know about what? Just go inside. I need to talk to my grandchildren. Are you my grandchild? Okay. I know that you're on bad terms with your father. Sarma told me about this. That's why I was so afraid you won't come to the ceremony. It's really hard to be parents. Even if you have problems with him, you have to admit that your father did a great job raising you to be this successful. Do you know why this family organized this ceremony for me? You must be confused. You know nothing about our traditions. You have gone to the city since junior high and now you don't come home that often. When I got married to your grandpa, we didn't have any money. We couldn't have a traditional wedding, only the church blessing ceremony. That's why I had debt. Your father promised us that he would hold a ceremony for us, but then he said he would do that after his children graduated from college and have become successful. You know that your father used to be poor, but he worked really hard with your mother to get to his place now. But still, for the Batak people, wealth is not just our money. The most important thing is our descendants. You are the most precious things for your father. Also for me. That is why the ceremony is in vain if you aren't here. Don't be mean to your father. He is the kindest person ever. Do what your mother does. She has lived for decades with your dad, and look how happy she is. MISS DINDA, PRODUCER YOU'RE AT THE AIRPORT NOW? DON'T ACT STUPID! YOU NEED TO GO BACK TONIGHT So, what now? Are you going back now? MISS DINDA, PRODUCER MISS DINDA, PRODUCER If anyone goes back, Mom will leave the house. We can't disappoint Grandma and ruin the ceremony. I'll make sure Mom and Dad come to Grandma's ceremony and go back. How can we do it? I don't know either. I think we can't be the ones who talk to them. We need someone's help. Someone our parents would listen to. Who? You're here, Priest? I'll make you a drink. Honey, what do you want to drink? Hot or cold? Just anything. Anything you make will be good. He knows about what is happening, Mom, Dad. Have a seat, you two. So… The kids have told me everything. I have promised them to keep this a secret. I just want to help because the kids have run out of ideas so you can make up. Meanwhile, tomorrow is the ceremony for their grandmother. So… Can we find a way out? Talk to each other. Let's do this. Maybe it's uncomfortable if you talk in front of us. You can talk in your room. Why is Priest here? I don't know. It's your job to find out about the kids' strategy. I know, and it's your job to blame me. So, now what? Just stick to the plan. -Okay then, come on. -Wait. Not this fast. They'll know something is fishy. Just stay here a bit longer and pretend like we're fighting. If I ask you, just answer it by yelling. Who's uglier between us two? -You! -You! You! You! -You! -You! -You! -It's okay. They're talking now, it's normal. And they're talking about something important. -You! -You! You! So, have you found a way out? We have agreed to stop arguing until the ceremony is over. As long as everyone will come to the ceremony, keep this a secret and keep our family honor. So, what about your intention to divorce Mom, Dad? We'll talk about it after your grandmother's ceremony is over. Okay, I agree with that. I'll postpone my departure to Jakarta. So our discussion ends here. We thank you for this, but please, don't let anyone know about this. Domu, this will look good on you. This fits you well! Sahat, hold this. Try this! MISS DINDA, PRODUCER Here. Looks good! Totally! Look how beautiful it is. -Hello, ma'am. -Horas, ma'am. -Have a look. -This is for my son. For Sahat. -Here you go. -It's nice,right? I'll take it. This is nice. Let's go. Let's find something else. Aren't you happy, Gabe? Let's sit here. Do you remember this place? Are you tired, son? Have a drink. Hey! Finally, you came here with the kids. -It's been ten years, I think. -Right, sir. -And Gabe has become a celebrity. -Right, Uncle. As usual, one misop, four bowls. Mom, we can't do that to him. We have money now. It's okay. I want to recall the good old times. It feels nostalgic. You're being weird, Mom. You're taking us for a walk when we have problems and now we're eating misop. I don't know. If we didn't have that problem, maybe I wouldn't enjoy this time with you. It's no use that you guys are successful. I thought you did this because you didn't have money, but it turned out you are just stingy. Wait, Uncle. This is to repay what my mom has done to you. Now, this is great! Showbizz money! It smells like the TV! You're still up? I can't sleep. Is there anything bothering you? I'm sorry. With everything happening between Mom and Dad, we haven't had a chance to talk. Nothing is wrong, Domu. Sarma, I just remembered. What about your relationship with Nuel? We broke up a year ago. Why? He didn't approve of me being a civil servant. But are you happy to be one? I enjoy it. If I'm not mistaken, you used to dream about going to culinary school. That was just a kid's dream. Even I forgot about that. Don't forget to think about yourself, Sarma. I know. Thank you, Domu. Domu, have you talked to Sahat and Gabe? They're your siblings too, you know? Why is each one of you so close to me but you don't get along? I don't know how to explain this. Dad never showed us, his sons, how to be caring, so we don't know how to act as men around each other. But with you, we see how Dad treats you, so we know how to act around you. Domu, please grab my ulos from the cabinet. Okay, Mom. Hey, you kids play over there! Hey, kids! Why are you playing here? Don't play here! Go over there! We have a ceremony here. Go over there! Come help. It will be ready soon. This is ulos for the dead. You'll be the death of your grandmother this way. I didn't know about it, Dad, and it's just a piece of ulos. That's why you need to marry a Batak woman, so someone can teach you. Domu, let me do it. Hey, I haven't got the meal. Not yet. This is for my kids at home. -I understand, "Namboru". -Why did you call me that? I have the same family name as your mother. I'm sorry. -I forget about that, "Nantulang". -Now you called me Nantulang? Are you out of your mind, Sahat? Excuse me, Auntie. That kid is really something. Your kids are so amazing. -You're flattering. -That's just natural. They're so kind, successful, and so intimate with each other. -I respect your family. -Thank you. Yeah. That's just how it is. Traditional ceremonies will cost you a lot! Right. There's a story about Ucok's grandpa who passed away. The family wanted to hold a ceremony. It cost them 50 million. Ucok said to his dad that it was too expensive and it's better for him to buy a motorbike. -I see. -His father got really angry. "Okay, let's just buy that motorbike, but you have to carry your grandpa's corpse everywhere!" You are so good at telling jokes! No wonder Gabe is a successful comedian now. It just runs in the blood! What do you mean successful? He said it's just temporary. He wants to be a judge or an attorney. Gabe, can I take a picture with you? -Excuse us. -Excuse us. Take care. Why don't you just stay here overnight? It's better if we go home. I don't think there's enough space for all of us. Why, Mom? Thank you, son. This ceremony happened thanks to you. Thank you, my grandchildren. You made me happy. When are you coming back? Tomorrow. If you guys are leaving, don't forget to say goodbye to me. Yes, Ma'am. I'll be sad if you forget. I'm so proud of your family. Why are you laughing? Grandma is so proud of our family. She doesn't know the truth. This is a family of artists, full of actors. Hey. You're laughing at your own family? But it's really funny. Don't start a fight, Gabe. We're all tired. Dad, Mom. We'll talk about your problem once we get home. Let's just talk tomorrow. I'm so tired. Honey, what about tomorrow? What are we going to do? Let's see tomorrow. But we don't have time, honey. Dad, let's talk about it now. I'll call Mom. Mom. Mom. Wait, Mom. Everyone, Mom has a fever. Mom. Are you okay? I'm okay, son. I just need to rest. Mom, take this medicine, okay? Slowly. Here. -You're done? -Mom. I'll make you porridge, okay? Okay. Poor Mom. Domu, Gabe. Wait, Mom. Is your mother okay? She's okay. She only needs to rest. Because she is sick, let's talk. Domu. So, do you have to marry that Sundanese woman? Why are we talking about me? We can talk while you're here. We can't talk about your mom since she is sick. Yes, Dad. I have to marry her. You can't! You have to marry a Batak woman. A Batak woman or a Sundanese woman, I don't care. We're all human. We can do a Batak wedding. Still, she's not a Batak people! She won't understand our traditions. You can say whatever you want. Just so you know, we have paid for the venue. How could you? I haven't said yes. A marriage only needs permission from the people we want to marry. Anyone else is not important. Okay, guys, now is Gabe's turn! When are you going to apply to be a judge or an attorney? Right, guys? -See? -Don't make this a joke! If you don't make use of your degree, my struggles will be in vain. In vain? Nothing is in vain. Look how smart I am. Only smart kids will talk back to their dad. Especially their old-fashioned dad. Okay, now, it is Sahat's turn. Sahat, keep your spirits up! Sahat! You know the Batak people always pass down the family house to their last kid. The house will be passed down to you, but if you don't take care of your parents here, you have no right to this house. -Okay, Dad. -Okay, what? It's okay if you don't give me the house. Hello. Who is this? Hello. I'm sorry for bothering you. I got your number from my friend. I'm Gabe's producer. Is he around? Hey. It's your producer. Hello. How are you? Have you gone mad? If you aren't coming back, I'm gonna fire you! You can pay the fine for breaching the contract! Okay, I'll try to-- I can't stay any longer. I have to go back. We should have talked about this today, but Mom got sick. And Dad is so weird. It's so easy for him to confront us, but he won't talk about his problem. You're right, I was so angry. Okay then, tomorrow is the last day. If he keeps confronting me, I'll go back to Jakarta right away. Mom, are you better? I am, sweetie. Where's your dad? He left this morning, Mom. I don't know where to. -Right? -What? I feel better now. I still miss you. -Let's go for a walk. -Mom, enough. Just take a rest. And we don't feel good anyway. Why do wives get mad when their husbands go to the lapo? Meanwhile, the husbands go to the lapo for their wives too. Everytime I come back from the lapo, my wife looks so beautiful. Do you know what makes her mad? You look ugly when you're drunk. No way. Why did you stop? Is your wife around? It's my wife! I have to go back. A call from the headquarters! -Just continue. -Okay! You're so good at joking. I've told you. Don't come to the lapo to pick me up! You only think about the lapo. The kids want to go back. We need to find a way so they'll stay. I still miss them. Should I mention the divorce again? It's no use now. While they are here, let's just confront them about their problems. No! We have to find another way! Don't talk about their problems. They'll leave right away. You need to persuade them to follow what we say. Honey, listen to me just for once. Don't force them to follow you. If they leave, everything is meaningless and nothing changes. They won't ever come home again. Just follow what I say. I know best. You know nothing! Horas. -Horas, sir. -Horas, sir. How is it? Have you two made up? -We have-- -No, we have not. I still need a little more time. A little more? Yes. Okay, then. Dad. Mom. Maybe this is the last time we can sit together. We can't stay here for long. We need to go back. So, we need to discuss your problem, okay? So, what now, Mom? You want to go back, right? Me too. I want to go back to my mother's house. Okay then, we choose to get divorced. We have agreed to do what you want. If you have decided, we don't have any choice but to accept it. What about you, Dad? It's decided then. I will divorce your mother. If you two have decided, we will go with it. And we want to say goodbye too, Mom. Dad. Now, it's your turn. I want to talk about you kids. Hey! When will you listen to me? I worked really hard to raise you. I sent you to school. And this is how you repay me? You just do whatever you want! You think I'm nothing? Don't stay silent! Answer me! I'm here! This is my life. Let me choose what makes me happy. Just think about your life. My life is all of you. My children are what makes me happy. But the way you treat us, the way you expect something from us, it doesn't make us happy. So I need to do what you want? Your way makes me happy? Now you talk back to me when you used to do what I say. No, we didn't follow you, we were just not brave enough to say no. We often disagreed with you, but we were not mature enough to fight. Now, it's different. We are adults. So, now, you can fight with me because you're adults? You think you're right? All of you think that you are doing the right thing. Aren't you just the same? Where do you think the kids learned to do that? Silent! I won't stay silent. I've been silent for so long and I have done what you say. You decide everything by yourself and I haven't said anything. You set me apart from my kids, I didn't say anything. You asked me to lie to my kids, I did what you told me. Now, it's your turn to listen! Lying? What do you mean lying, Mom? Your dad told me to pretend that I asked for a divorce so that the three of you would come home so you could attend Grandma's ceremony so he could talk about your problems. I'm telling you. It's true that I pretended about the divorce, but my reasons to ask for the divorce are real. That's how I feel. Sarma. You knew about this? You knew that they were lying? -Sarma. -Answer him, Sarma. Sarma. You knew, right? If they called us, I would've been suspicious, but it was you who called and begged us, so I agreed to come home. You're the one I trusted in this house. It's the same for me. I can trust no one now. I don't know whose house this is and I don't know which family I belong to. How could you do that to us? Mom. If things get serious, we'll talk about it later. Sweetie. Help me, okay? If we don't lie to your brothers, they won't come home. But don't let your mom know, okay? Okay? You always say that women can't talk back and should listen, right? But I saw you fought back just now. I won't stay silent, Mom. You don't know how it feels to be the only daughter in this family. I feel so trapped. When you were against Dad, I never said anything, I never said a word. I never talked back to Dad and did what he said, and you guys interfered. You couldn't mind your own business. Domu, do you know why I broke up with Nuel? It's because Dad found out he's a Javanese. Dad said if you marry a Sundanese and I marry a Javanese, he would be ashamed. Ashamed, that's what he said to me. Gabe, do you know that I was accepted to culinary school in Bali? But Dad told me to find a stable job so I don't do what you do. I threw away my dream. He said that if I go to Bali, no one would take care of them since you won't come back home, Sahat. You didn't want to come back home, right? Domu, you told me to never forget to think about myself, right? .Now, let me ask you. If I think about myself, who would think about Mom and Dad? Who would? I can't stand this anymore! Let's talk again tomorrow. No! I have to go back to Jakarta. Dad, we need to finish everything today! I know. I know. You really can't listen to others! If you don't care about this family anymore, fine! -Let's just end everything here! -Mom. Chinese noodles are delicious But gomak noodle is even more delicious And because it's so delicious I always think about it Those who have the power Must not be greedy Remember the life of the people Who struggle just to survive You, Batak people Take care of your health Wealth is meaningless It's no use after you die That's why you need To remember your hometown The place where the Batak King came from Where have you been? I came from Grandma's place. So, your mom and siblings are all there? Mom and Sarma left for Grandma's house last night. To her mother's house. Not your mother's. Domu and Gabe left last night. Then, why are you still here? I called Mr. Pomo last night. I told him everything. I said I wanted to go back there. He said I should stay. He told me to not leave my dad alone and to say goodbye properly to Grandma, also to you. That's just an example of why I want to stay with Mr. Pomo. He listens to people. I learned to listen, to live, and other things from him when I should have learned that from you, not from anyone else. Dad, I'm leaving. Sahat. Does your grandma know about this? No, Dad. I didn't say anything to her. -Let's play. -Come on! Why are you… What is it, son? What did you cook, Mom? I'm hungry. Geez, look at my son. Come in. Is it good? It's really good. Your cooking is the best in the world. No match! But you came here not to enjoy my food, right? I know everything. Sarma called me a week ago. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. It's all my fault. Enough. Enough. It's not me you need to apologize to. Why didn't you come to my house? Why didn't you take care of me? I need to let you know how it feels to live alone, so you'll come to your senses. You need your wife and children. Why are you fighting? I have failed as a father. I just do what my dad did. I follow his way. Dad raised us so well. Your dad did the right thing for kids like you. You kids live here all your life. You went to junior high school and high school, but you sent your kids to study far away to get the highest education. If your kids are smart and able to think critically, don't be angry. You made them that way. So, what do I do now? I don't know either. But remember. If the children keep getting better at doing things, the parents should do the same. It's endless work to be a parent. You need to keep learning. Mom. Let's pick up the kids' mother, okay? Son. Picking her up is not that simple. We need to do that with our family. People will know. I know, Mom. I don't mind. Mom. Mom. On behalf of Domu's father, I apologize to you. We hope you agree to come home with us. Can I talk to him in private? Mom. Let's go home. How is your work? I resigned. I will stay here. I'm leaving, Mother. What? So persistent. -Hey! -Come here! When you do a quiz like this, do you remember your dad? It's so obvious. That's not how you do it. Talk to us smoothly and then drop the gimmick. Just answer me. Do you miss your dad? -Just call him! -Please, welcome, Acho's dad! It's his dad! Gotcha! They really look alike. Not the size. Are you proud to have a comedian son? TICKET BOOTH No. You should say yes. He's a television celebrity now. He told his mother about his work, but he didn't tell me. You disobedient child! -Tell your dad too. -What did he tell his mom? Gabe said he's happy to work as a comedian because he brings joy to people. It doesn't matter whether I'm proud or not. What matters is he is doing something that makes him happy. So, Gabe, I'm sorry for making you unhappy for so long. -Look at you two crying. -Gabe, hug your dad. Tell us a joke. Sir, hug him. Have a drink, Amangboru. You know what to call me? Domu taught me a little about the Batak traditions. Nantulang isn't coming with you? "Amangboru" is paired with "Namboru" while "Tulang" is paired with "Nantulang". I'm sorry, I haven't learned that much. Tell me. Why did you agree to marry him? You're so straightforward. Domu may look strict, but he is so kind. I can trust him, and there is no reason for me to doubt him. Would you agree to do a traditional Batak wedding? -Yes, I would. -You would? I would. I like Batak weddings. Batak weddings are unique, sacred, and emotional. I asked him once about it, but he said you would not approve of it. Yes? Welcome. Is this Mr. Pomo's house? Yes, it's my house. I'm Sahat's father. Hormas! "Hormas"? That's how the Batak people greet, right? It's "Horas"! -Horas! -Horas! I'm sorry, I can't remember things well at this age. Come in. During the student study service in this village, Sahat and his friends stayed here at my house. They slept on a mattress. He led the team with a lot of Batak students. And the wonderful thing is the people here liked him. And all the people here are Javanese. During the study service, he told me that once he graduated, he would come back to stay here. I thought he was just joking, but he kept his word and came back here. He helped the people by teaching them the newest farming methods so the farmers could get better harvests, also how to sell at higher prices. It was successful. I admired him. And the people here really love him. Mom. What did you say to Dad? Domu's father. If you really have changed, listen to me. The family who should pick me and Sarma up is not this one. Domu's mother, come on. Let's go home. I can't. I'm still eating. Just wait until I'm done. What are you eating? Gomak noodles. I made it myself. We have no choice. You should wait, Dad. Come on. Join us. I didn't put poison in it. If you don't believe me, tell Gabe to lead the prayer again. It's true that you didn't poison the food. I've eaten five spoons and I'm okay. I have prayed, so the food is safe. If your prayer works, just pray so you can be handsome. You're right, Dad. But what can we do? You're our father. THIS IS WHAT WE CAN GIVE WE HOPE IT CAN BE A BLESSING FOR US.
