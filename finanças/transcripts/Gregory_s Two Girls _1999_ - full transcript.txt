This has got to stop. Mr. Underwood, it's got to stop. Don't call me that. It's Greg. But it's got to stop, Greg. All this looking. All that not touching. I can't take it anymore. It's time to touch, Greg. Touch me. Feel me. I've locked the door. Oh, Greg. We have to try Mr. Underwood again. This is too much. OK, Mr. Underwood. That's worse. Call me Greg. One soak up and one soak down. Oh, Mr. Underwood. Oh, no, no, no, stop it. Stop it. Oh, Mr. Underwood. Please, please my darling girl, don't call me Mr. Underwood one more time, or I'll-- Mr. Underwood? We know you're in there. Mr. Underwood, this is the headmaster. I have two policemen with me, and Mr. McAlpine's gone to fetch the master key. Don't stop, Mr. Underwood. Stop, I beg you. Oh, please. Please, my darling girl. Don't-- don't call me-- Don't stop, Mr. Underwood. I'll tell them I love you. They'll let you. Stop what you're doing. I'll wait for you. No, no, no. I'm waiting for you. You want me to wait for you if you go to jail? --door open in one minute, Underwood. Leave that girl alone. I beg you. I order you to leave that girl alone. One soak up, one soak down. Where the hell did that come from? OK, on TV, one night. Big news. An earthquake somewhere unpronounceable. Horrific pictures, 20,000 people dead. Whole city flattened. Crying mothers, bodies, the whole lot. Really gets to you. But then a week later, there's nothing. No more news. So what's happened? Is everything suddenly better? No. But this week, guess what? Big news. A panda's having triplets. You're consumers of useless facts, as well as all the other junk. What do you do with it all? Junk food, junk facts. We want facts. We need them. We have to learn about everything, politics, mathematics, sexual reproduction. Good. Good, Gordon, could be a record. Managed to get sex into the conversation four minutes into the lesson. That's it with you lot. Sex, sex, sex. Sorry I'm late. The team meeting went on a bit. That's all right, Frances. And I needed a shower. Of course you did. Here, what are we doing? Questioning reality. What's real, what's not real. OK, what book? No book, just me. All right, sir. You told us to tell you if you were wandering off English. Yes, thanks, Alice. But we haven't actually wandered too far. We're talking about the written word versus dumb distraction on a screen. Now fact and fiction look and feel the same. But question things. You talk about interactive computers-- interact with the real world. Don't spectate, participate. Charlene? It's 3:00. Well, that's an undeniable fact. The pom-poms. Me and Louise have got to collect the pompoms at 3:00. The cheerleaders? Oh right, yes. The new American football team. And what's the meaning behind that fact? It's just one more way America dominates the world. - Well, can we go? - Yeah, yeah, on you go. Go on, be culturally brainwashed. Well, we're in a mess here. You'll get out one of your magazines and tell us more miserable things about the world. Well, you'll never know if you're not here, will you? And it's , an unpronounceable place where the earthquake was. geography, we get geography. Who do you think you're talking to? Oh, he's asking me to question reality again. None of it's He's not Well, I hate to say it, but she was right. OK. What? We've get pom-poms too. It's democracy. You let Charlene go. All right. Ready? OK. Let's go, Rowan, let's go. Defense. Stop looking at the girls. That's what they're there for. They love it. You see what I mean? We want more of it. We like it, we love it. Anyway, I paid for them. We like it, we love it. Does the headmaster know about this? Private preview last Thursday. Delighted. I should have insisted on taking a hand in the auditions. Some women are. God, they're schoolgirls, not your personal bloody harem. Oh, that's my problem, Greg. I'm always seeking perfection. You've sponsored the only team in the country. Who are they going to play? Oh, well it's early days. It's a big dream. Big dreams take time. You definitely spent too long in America. Seeing that would get you out of bed on a Saturday morning, friend. I do indeed perfection. Sweat, moist hair, clinging to her temples. Cream white thighs, reddened from the cold air and the slap of physical contact. Celtic beauty. Christ, I could never be a teacher, Greg. How do you put up with it, day in, day out, smelling that wafting past you along the corridors? It's not just beauty, either, is it? I mean, it's just sheer living. Youth and newness, fresh newness. I don't have the words. Do you think they'd let me sponsor a third-year girl's mud wrestling team, Greg? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I've got to see you. Fix it. You're playing well, Frances. Asset to the team. Fix it. Pleasure to watch. How was it for you? How do know her? What did she say? Come on, she said something. What was it? - Here. Keep them. No, take them, and stop looking at girls. Keep them, keep them, keep them. Don't hurt my feelings. I'm sensitive. Hey, it's great to see you, Greg, after so long. Yeah, what's it like being back? People keep their distance. Well, let's face it, you're not just a local boy who made good. You're a fucking legend. Anyway it's good to see you. Listen, we'll get together soon, eh? I'll be in touch. Sorry I can't give you a lift. Only one helmet. You're all right. And maybe you don't want a lift anyway. But go easy, eh? Francis, you wanted to-- Hi, Francis. Hi, Mr. Underwood. Danger is everywhere, my friend. You know, racism is always on top of robbery. You know. You have to make sure that the right people do the plundering. Now Indonesia was just open to be robbed. In October, 1965 General Suharto took over. He carried out a huge massacre. The PKI was wiped out. The United States was absolutely euphoric. They had wiped out the one political party, the party that was defending the interests of the poor. They had undermined the threat to US interests. Now Indonesia was just open to be robbed. Hiya, Bel. Why are you not ready? I'm not going anywhere. But you said you were. I said I might. Well, you might have phoned if you weren't. Well, you might have called to check. I'm sorry, Bel. Oh, come on. Just put on a shirt or something. Nah, I need a bath. Need a bath. We are just going to eat some Japanese food and drink too much sake. It's not an orgy. Nobody wants to lick your body. Oh, come on. You're making me look like a fool. I'm going to be like a spare prick. Stop trying to organize me, Bel, OK? I don't like it. I'm not out to run your life. It's a fucking Saturday night. I thought you might have a good time. I've got a new Chomsky tape. Do you want to come in? You are running out of chances, pal. It was a very casual arrangement, Bel. Enjoy your sushi. - Fuck off. OK. I meant it. Fix it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. "In Chile, the United States resorted to economic strangulation and military force to overthrow the democratic regime." Chomsky may not be Chaucer, but he still creates language. Strangling an economy, good functional metaphor. Think, what else could you do to an economy? Oh! What we talked about last week? When do you think we could meet up? Really not a good time, Frances. Come on, out, out, all of you. Come on, Frances. You could massage it. What? An economy. Out. How was the sushi, Bel? It's and odd old taste. Don't know if you could handle it. It was fishy. That teacher in the south-- they were onto him from the start. Spying on him. Even went through his garbage, found love poems he'd written to the wee girl. Total obsession. God, is that your only topic of conversation, sex? Yeah. That tosser's going to rule the world one day. Makes me glad I belted out of the shit out of him on a regular basis when he was here as a boy. Anyone can fall for some wee nymphet in their class. It's not perversion. It's life, love. Things to talk about, a joke, open up. Keep it to yourself, and it turns into an unhealthy obsession. Know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 35,000 people die every day of hunger, and meanwhile on page 11, in America, every day, they spend $100 million on slimming aids. Charlene's right. Why do you keep depressing us? Well, don't you want to make things better? I just want to go to America for my holidays. You've been alive for 15 years. You've spent five of them sleeping, and five watching TV. Do you want to go through your whole life in a dream? Sir, forget it. No, no, no, I don't mind fighting for my beliefs, Frances. You're supposed to teach us, not fight us. Give up. Thanks a lot, Bel. Have a nice weekend. - OK. Have you got any plans? No. Well, just the usual. Well, if you're at a loose end on Saturday-- Yeah, well, can't make any promises. Well, we know that. Yeah you know I am. And and said he might phone. Fraser. Your new pal. Well, if it doesn't pan out, it could-- Pretty sure it will pan out. Look, we're friends. OK, I know. I know we're friends. Well, don't forget if you want to behave like a friend sometimes, when I feel like seeing you. No, no, no, no, you're-- no. It's kind of normal. No, no, yeah, no. Yeah, I know it's normal. Well, relax then. Yeah, uh-huh, mm-hmm, OK. Well, have a nice weekend. Relax. Open that door and talk to me like a man. I know you're in there. It's your last chance. After this, I'm through with you. How could I expect you to love me, even want you for a friend when you treat me like this? You make me walk the night like this. You do want me, don't you? You do. Just admit it. You're not going to get by on your boyish charm much longer, my lad. Your clock's running too. |'m a giving person, Greg. You're not letting me give. That's cruel. Hello? What have you done to me? Yeah, sorry Yes, there's someone I know. Drunk. No, emotional. A recent bereavement. Her friends are trying to help her. To be your lover and your friend, that's all. The police? No. But I can't stop you. Bye. That's all. Bel, you are my friend, just-- I knew you were in there, friend. So why don't we just fuck too? That would be everything taken care of. Everything taken care of. It's easy, just open the door, and give me a cuddle. No. You don't have the needs of an ordinary person, do you? You couldn't treat me like this if you did. Look what you've done to me. Open the door. No. I bet you do it with the lights off if you fucking do it at all. You are on your last chance, buddy. Shit. Morning. How are you feeling? Come on in and have a coffee. So long, Bel. This is the first time we meet in the school, understand. Not that it isn't dangerous outside, too. We just have to be careful. This is where and when, remember. I'll straighten things out. Nobody can blame us for wanting to do that. I'm not leading you into anything, but we should talk. You know what about? Some things you can't hide, Frances. Better get back to your class. See you later. What's coming out of all of this is kind of a third world model, with a huge surplus population. And what do you do with them? Well, they've obviously got to be kept in ignorance. But more than that, they've got to be controlled. Here, the favored method is just to lock them up. Hope I'm not late. What's that smell? For Men. Present from my sister. It's a good spot you picked, here. Yeah, well, I know these woods. Thanks for seeing us. It means a lot. I know you're taking a chance. It's really strong, that smell. I'm sorry. Shut up, Doug. So how much do you know? Well, let's just assume that I know nothing, and see where we get to. OK. Well, for a start, we're taking a chance too, because we don't how pally you are with Mr. Rowan. Fraser Rowan? I was at school with. We had our moments when we were boys. I've seen him once since he came back from America. Why? What's this got to do with him? We stole some stuff from his factory. That sounds all wrong, Doug. We were doing some work experience there, and we found out all this stuff. The people there are too scared for their jobs to do anything. World Alert That's one of mine. Yeah, you got us started. Made in the UK. Torch at the touch of a button. Electronic torture machines. Illegal exports, Asia, Africa. Well, torture, eh? What is it, techno music? It's not funny. I gave you this as an example of good committed journalism. Vivid language, persuasive argument. Now Fraser might be a bit of a tosser. But I don't think he hurts people. He makes bits for computers. And some of these bits hurt people. He's creepy. When he looks at you, you feel like he's undressing you in his mind. Stripping you naked, do you know what I mean? Now look, this just doesn't sound real. We want to prove it's real. We can't just be spectators, can we? Can you try to get us part time jobs at Rowan? Say it's part of a school project? Then you can put back the things that you stole. - No. - No, not quite. Doug needs to look at some more stuff in there. It's got a secret bit. Nobody gets in there. I did once. I got this. A modulator. Doug made his first synthesizer when he was 12. Oh god, what is that thing worth, Douglas? You know, that's theft. That is bad news. I cannot be a part of this. It's in your magazine. You made us read it. Is it fiction? "Make some noise that makes you sick." Epileptic fits, vomit. Yeah, well, even if it was true, what difference can you make? We've seen all the wrong things. Well, OK. Supposing I was to get you the jobs. Would you maybe put that thing back? Maybe. I thought you'd be excited. Well, I am, I am. I'm glad that you came to me. You mean that? You don't mind the risk? You don't think we're getting carried away? Well, we all get carried away sometimes, Frances. And as for risk, I've contemplated risk before. But think about what you're doing. Now Rowan employs hundreds of people in that factory, good jobs. Your friends mums and dads. What about them? Well, what's worse? Torture or no jobs? That's a pretty big question, Doug. You know, I didn't think I was coming up here to discuss the moral niceties of international trade. And what did you think you were coming up for? Better let you go, then. Must be going somewhere. You're all dressed up. Not anymore. Lot to think about. You guys better get off down the hill, eh? Yeah. Thanks. Good night. Yeah. Thanks. It's been fun. Fun? Oh, not fun ha ha, but interesting. Do it again some time, eh? Doug, wait for me. But the executive secretary said I had to hold for the personal private secretary. Fraser, I'd like to speak to him. Underwood, personal private friend. Well-- what? I have to make an appointment to talk to him on the phone? Well, no, I'd love to give you some telephone numbers, but I don't have any. Just tell him Greg Underwood. I'll try again later, OK? Thank you. Bye. God, listen to this. 80 million Americans say they've seen an angel. Must be all these slimming pills they're eating. You told us to tell you if you're wandering off English. Yes? Underwood, you have to sign for it. Hello? Hello? Fraser! What? Yeah, well, that's very, uh-- what can I say? You're a very giving person. I wanted to ask you something. I finish at four. Actually, just go. Yeah, you bet. M1, Memory 1. OK? That's your personal private number, eh? Ooh, I'm honored. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Quick stop at the airport. Don't worry, I'm not going to kidnap you. Don't expect to meet Fraser this trip. Don't worry, he's been briefed. He knows you're around. He sees everything. He might even drop in to the spec meeting. Fraser. Yeah, Greg. Yeah, on my way. Be with you in five. Oh, OK, old buddy. OK. There you are. Here I am. Mr. Underwood. And how are you? Sorry, do we know each other? Do you not remember? Last year? 5B? Janice McGarrin! My god! Jan now. Greg. Greg. Greg, how the hell are you? Yeah, good. Well, thanks for answering the call. Well, I wanted to see you. But I phoned you. I know, but I called you first. Oh, you give me a call. But I give you a phone. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, listen, I need a favor. Memo for Two kids for work experience, a reference Greg Underwood. Usual 10 hours a week deal. Frances McCance Douglas Dunne? Yep. Oh, and Natasha, is that green tea on the way? Thanks. Oh yes, lady Frances, of the white thighs! Oh Greg, you're not. Are you? Are you? I told you that's dangerous stuff. No, no. You get involved with these kids in different ways when you're teaching. No, it's nothing like that. Relationship's vary. Slow down, slow down. Save it for the judge. I'll show you the whole place, Greg. The boring assembly stuff we do in Ireland. Here, we do the really specialized stuff. Have you any idea what a hit you get making, creating 400 high quality jobs in your home town? I had a hard-on for a week. It's better than a Bangkok treble header. 400 jobs? Just thinking about it is giving me a hard-on. Excuse me. It's a real moon rock, Greg, you want it? Take it. - Oh, god. No, no, no. Thanks very much. It must be worth a fortune. What can I do with this man, Natasha, huh? Offer him the moon and he turns me down. Where does all this stuff end up? Every corner of the globe, Greg. Last year we took more revenue in Japan-- get this-- than the whole Scottish whisky industry. Did that impress you? Oh, oh, nearly another hard-on. Ah, well that's just business, Greg. Hard-ons where you least expect them. So that's why you supply coats. Here, sir. Keep off sign is just irresistible to you, isn't it Greg? Only way you're getting in the sterile area is if you've been bodily hand washed and clinically oiled by our team of masseuses. You ready for that? There's a guy in there eating a cheese sandwich. What's sterile about that? So there is. Well, there's many definitions of sterile, Greg. Anyway, look, this is one of our own systems. Everyone's got a unique entry code. Right, your age is 34. Miss McCance is 15? Well, whatever. So 3415 and 6 years for a conviction? Right, that's your entry code. My innermost secrets are yours. Press enter and try it. Ah, ah, ah. This is as far as you go this trip, my friend. Come on in, I'll show you my baby. My pet. I could be more proud of this than anything else. We recycle computers for the third world. Africa, mostly. I've set up a charity. In Europe, everyone wants the latest, so they're junking perfectly good hardware after two years. So we gather it, clean it up, and reassemble. It's good experience for trainees on the line, too. But it's not just the charity, but advancing these people as consumers. So does that rate a semi hard-on? Good night, Peter. Decorum, Greg. This is charity. Oh, what was that you called me today on the phone? What did you call me? A-- Very giving person. A very giving person. See, I couldn't have found these words. But I like that. That's good. That's cute. That's your gift. You can sum things up. Good night, Fraser. Good night. Good night, Fraser. Good night, Fraser. Good night. Good night, ladies. Good night, Fraser. Good night, sweet ladies. Good night, Fraser. Good night. Night, Fraser. Good night. Hey. Hiya. Doug's got heavy duty homework. Oh, that's a shame. Just the two of us? - Yeah, just the two. Listen, I want to warn you about something. Guy with the dog. Talks to it. Dog seems to listen. Never apart, him and the dog. Ever seen them in the street, the park, any time tonight? No. Well, just have to be careful. I don't think he's seen us together yet. It would be a catastrophe if he did, so watch out. Wait a minute. He's following you because you're seeing me? That's a bit unreal. I'm a teacher, remember? You're a pupil. This is a park. That's the world we live in, Frances. Isn't it more likely he works for Rowan? Rowan? Forget Rowan, I saw him. There's nothing going on. Fraser's a bit difficult to warm to, I know, but he is not torturing people, believe me. I've got you the jobs. Tell Doug to put that thing back, yeah? So we do nothing. There's nothing to be done. Look, even if it was true, we couldn't handle that. That's a big tight organization he's running there. So we do nothing, just spectate? You'll never be a spectator. Pick a better target. Look around. Don't get obsessed by the one thing. There's lots to do. Even Fraser-- he's giving computers to poor countries. You could get involved in that. Really doing something, something real. Don't patronize me. Well, that's it. Frances, talk to me. What is it? The world. Oh, the world. All the pain, the suffering. It's your fault. My fault? All of it? Well, you make us care, but then you don't tell us what to do. Doesn't Doug and I coming to you mean anything? How can I sleep tonight if there's one hungry baby? How can I be happy? Those , those , and kids with no homes. And people in prison, and tortures, and wars. I want to make it stop. Thought you understood. Do you feel an intolerable pity for the helpless and unhappy? Do you feel across thousands of miles, that somewhere in Sicily a thin, naked little donkey with a shaggy belly's being brutally beaten? Who said that? I guess that wasn't me. Nabokov. About youth. Have to be young to feel that ache. Sad thing is you'll get over it. You have to. The pain will stop. making me sort of stop. I want to stop it. Don't tell me I can't try. I'm not talking about wee donkeys, just. I know, I know. Don't think we could stop all of it. I know. Don't think so. He's the guy who wrote Lolita. Umm, err, yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's a-- you know, listen, we'll try. I'm seeing some people from the UN. I'll bring Fraser up with them, see what they think. You're kidding. No, I mean it. I've got connections. Look. UN diary. I know it's last year's. But I got all my telephone numbers in it. Cheer up. We will stay on the case. And it's Nabokov. Eh? Well, if it's Russian, it's Nabokov. (CORRECTING HIS PRONUNCIATION) Nabokov. Bo? Bo. Bo? Bo. Bo? Bo. Bo? Bo. Boo! Bo. Bo. Boo. - What are you guys, up to? - Doug. I finished my essay early. Have I missed anything? Think I have. I'm telling-- I'm telling you, this country is pocket-sized. From up on the castle, you can see for 20 miles. Yeah, it's 700 years old. Did you ever hear of King Wallace? Does he never heard of postcards? Just, please go easy on all the anti-American crap, will you? I happen to like this man a lot. We'll go to Loch Lamond later on. That's Lomond, actually. Yeah, it's-- yeah, it's half an hour away. King Wallace. Jesus, Christ. No, no, I'd guess you'd call it-- What a future, eh? Electronic postcards, everything babbling away into their mobile telephones. Constant global cackle. No, the monsters lack mass. Yeah. This is beautiful. He your translator too? Nope. He's in building admin at the moment. Building admin. You mean he changes the light bulbs? Don't scoff. It's a sort of rest year. He just finished four years in Africa, refugee commission. There's a lot to him. So Greg, did Wallace and Rob Roy get along? Hard to say, John. The intervening 400 years limited any meaningful relationship, good or bad. How can I help you understand? It's like asking if Christopher Columbus was pally with Popeye. Yeah, Popeye. Gregory, in the back. How come I can understand you, Maddy, but not a thing your brother says? You can understand me, Greg. Why can't I understand you? Pardon me, John? She's doing this to annoy us. She only took up Italian because I was doing it at school. All I can say is, bella, bella. Maddy's the world citizen in our family. I haven't even visited your fair country. It's pretty much like here. Though I haven't been back in eight years myself. No? Why? That's a good question. Hiding, I guess. I'm still coming to terms with the place. I spent my whole life doing that. Yeah, I have pretty strong world views myself. Although I haven't traveled much. You're not alone, Greg. The rest of the world is a fiction to most Americans too, just images on a TV. Wasn't quite equating myself with your average American, John. Yeah, I mean the whole world buys our fantasies. Don't participate, consume. That's been the message. Everything's image. Exactly. Illusions of wealth sold to the poor, illusions of freedom to the oppressed, illusions of power to the weak. But it's changing. People, individuals are starting to question economic gain as the only gauge of success. Don't get me started. Because I really think we're coming out of a dark age, but you have to be optimistic, don't you? Illusions of wealth, illusions-- do you mind if I write that down? You don't have to. I'll track it down and send it to you. It's Galiano or Chomsky, or Chomsky quoting Galiano, more like it. I'll find it. Chomsky. Chomsky. You know Chomsky? Chomsky? Sure, I know Chomsky. I quote Chomsky. Oh well, I took some classes with him at MIT. Oh, you know Chomsky? Somebody stealing your lines, Greg? No, his are better. Who's Galiano? Bella, bella. I suppose you're lucky, really, living in an old, safe, dead country like this. Makes for a comfortable life. That's a bit of a sweeping assessment, based on half a day's experience there, John. I'm just going on the evidence. And the stuff you want to show me. Old castles. Look at your river here. It's dead. No connections with the world anymore. When you go to Africa, Asia, you won't find a dead river like this. Your battles are hundreds of years behind you. All your heroes are statues. I'm against the hero on principle. People do things now, ordinary people. That's true. I'll grant you that. That's the way it has to go. It's happening everywhere, even in the States. People get active locally on a specific issue. See democracy, at least the start to it. You have to be active. I am active. Kind of. Locally. Really? That's interesting. Yeah, I think so. Illegal trade, high tech torture equipment. Local firm. I know the stuff you mean. You do? Sound generation, isn't it? Thought it mostly came out of the East, though. Who are you working with? What do you mean? Well, Amnesty, any of the big pressure groups? No, it's just a couple of local activists. Well, watch out. I mean it. Be careful. If you're on to something, you'll be taking on the whole system. Arms trade always goes right to the heart of power. It doesn't matter where you are. You should get some protection. Connect with Amnesty, or Freedom Alert, they deal with the torture issue. Mind you, they're probably already there. To be frank, and not to be rude, but if you know about it, chances are they do too. Listen, I've got a friend at the UN in New York, the Human Rights Commission. He could give you some information. Kalim. It's the guy I was phoning earlier. UN pen. Yeah. Here. Cheers. Stick with it. I asked him what he thinks of you. He said that earlier, he thought you were just eccentric in a very dull British sort of way. But now you think you're probably more interesting than that. God, a thinking, feeling Yank, and you find him? I can't believe it. My wee sister finds him. I'm sure there are a few more. Christ, I'm excited. I don't see him as rude so much as stimulating. Do you know what I mean? Makes you think, doesn't he? He does other things to me. But that too. That too. Listen, you know those like, big UN desk diaries? - Mm-hmm. - Could you? It's for a friend. I'll bring you a few at Christmas. Right. Yeah, bye. Bye. He's all right, really. And listen, Maddy, breed with him. We need more like him. You have a duty to breed. OK. So the man with the dog's a human rights activist? Could be. Could just be. He must think you're in with Rowan. Come to think of it, oh dear, yeah. I'm falling behind here. I told you, somebody's been following Mr. Underwood. So he says. He thought it because he was trying to seduce me, you know, entice me up here for sex in the park, the old guy, young girl thing. Oh, oh. I see. No, that's what we thought he thought. Not what I thought, or was thinking. All right. But now this guy that you thought thought you were trying to seduce Frances is really tailing you because of Rowan? Well, it's a possibility, yeah. You're not just paranoid? That was My, first thought too, Doug. I don't think so. It's kind of unreal. Why am I having to convince you two now? Let's face the facts. If what Rowan is doing is real, then this guy could be real. You two have put yourselves at the center of a global moral issue. I've checked it out with the UN. It's amazing. You are amazing. Yeah, she is, isn't she? Yeah, well you're amazing too. You are both in your different ways. You're both amazing. Look, take your jobs at Rowan's OK? Play it cool. This guy, if he wants to get close, we'll let him. Let's get active. It's an American phrase. Listen, could you get me a UN pen too? It would be my pleasure, Doug. In fact, you know what? No, you'd probably prefer a new one, eh? I'll get you a new one. Ooh. Whoa. Whoo. It's late. Down the hill one at a time, I think, Doug. Off you go. Be careful. Oh, great. OK. So long. He's quiet when you're around. He sees you as a bit of a hero. Goes on and on about you all the time. No! Maybe I should have given him the pen, eh? Oh, I'm a rotten person. No you're not. Thanks for making us stick with it. It's your fight. I'm just holding the coats. Doug's right, doesn't feel real, does it? Maybe because it is real. You get used to living with all the fiction. Something real happens, you hardly recognize it. Up until last week, the most important decision I had to make was how many cans of tomatoes to buy. Really? I had you down as a sweet corn man. Yeah, only every second Sunday. So you're always sad. Be alert. Take in everything the world has to offer. Don't miss a trick. Don't let anything slip by. Isn't dangerous, is it? What, sweet corn? Oh, god. What? It's nobody. It's my dad. Frances. Come here. Shit. What do we do? Come and speak to him. Oh, Jesus Christ. You're mother's worried sick. You should have been home an hour ago. Sorry Dad. I forgot the time. Who's this? It's my English teacher. What? Greg Underwood, Mr. McCance. We may have met at films night. What the hell's going on? School finished seven hours ago. Dad. I'll explain. Let's go home. We weren't alone. Young Douglas was with us too. Just left a second ago. You might have seen him. Douglas! No, I think he's gone. Douglas. You don't have any kids, do you? Eh, no. No. It's bloody obvious. We'll talk about this in daylight. Douglas! Maybe if you see him, you might want to give him a lift. It's just-- it just-- Fuck. Big trouble. Read this and eat it. And don't go near Frances. Hello, Is it Detective Constable? Yeah, Detective Constable Gorrie, this is Detective Constable Ritchie. Mr. Underwood, we're ready for you now. Mr. Underwood! Mr. Underwood. Sit down, Greg. You know everyone, except Detective Constables Ritchie and Gorrie. Let's get down to it. Firstly, although it may seem over dramatic, I'm glad in a way that Mr. McCance decided to consult the police. It'll at least show that we can take the full glare of scrutiny. Although we have rather bypassed the more traditional forms of teacher-parent communication. I appreciate what you're saying, but we have to acknowledge that Mr. McCance acted very decisively and correctly. Hopefully, the explanation is simple. But why take a chance when young lives are involved? Mr. Underwood, we've spoken to Frances, and she has given us her explanation of the facts very clearly and confidently, I might add. We're not disinclined to believe her. All we want is your version. And hopefully, put the whole matter to rest. I know you two haven't talked since last night. So if it all tallies-- Right, well I'll just jump in then, and presume, Frances, that you've told them everything about everything, and I'll do the same, and you're happy with that? Best not question Frances directly, Mr. Underwood. Just talk to us all. Of course. Well, I take it that Francis has told you about her badger. The badgers, the badger. The badger in the country park. The badger in the country park, that when we-- when we-- when we-- when-- when we-- listen, I'm not sure if you want the fine detail, or just the broad strokes. Anything you've got. Anything I've got. Right, well, the badger in the country park that she and myself and young Douglas have been spending time observing-- or hoping to observe-- the badger that so inspired Frances. It's been years and years since badgers have been sighted so close to an urban area. And what might this mean for the recolonizing of other parts of the country by badgers? And of course, the need for secrecy. Because there are people out there who would like to get their hands on a badger. So why is an English teacher involved? Good question. Good question. The fact is that fact and fiction is my thing. What's real and what isn't. Now I've always admired Frances, her energy. And so when she came to me with the badger story, I saw it as a way to encourage this to develop real journalistic skills. I was very enthusiastic. She and Douglas did all the hard work. And I've got a confession to make. Frances, I wasn't really interested in the badger, per se. It was more of the experience of looking. Am I talking too much? The speculation, the anticipation, the disappointment, the ultimate triumph or not. And then to retell the stories. Great stuff. Imagine, you've been hunting for it, dreaming of it, that elusive beautiful thing. And then, there it is, badger. I mean, we're talking about a vivid experience here. Have you ever seen a badger close up? How come you got so much time for just two people? What about all the others? Comes and goes. Comes and goes. You know, they all need special attention at some time. Right now, it's Frances. I won't deny it. I have a lot of time for her. Her talents, and Douglas. No, in a case like this-- extra-curricular-- the pupils lead and I follow. And so what were you doing last night? Well-- well, last night was pretty exciting, actually. Because Frances had more or less promised, as-- you see, the thing is, I've never actually seen Frances' beaver. Frances' beaver. Of course I didn't mean Frances' beaver. Badger, it's Frances' badger. That's enough. Her beaver. I mean, it's a bit of a mouthful. Badger, that's a mouthful, not beaver. It's a tongue twister, trying to get your tongue round Frances' badger, eh? Well, mouthful, of course, is a turn of phrase. It doesn't actually imply eating of any kind, or munching. Certainly not munching. Are you a married man, Mr. Underwood? No. Wouldn't be beaver. Last one trapped in Scotland was 1630. Just so, Alister, just so. And you'd be a lucky man to come across a beaver in our park. Yes, Alister, just so. Scottish beaver, a very exotic creature. Fraser, hi. Yeah. Well, no time for banter. I'm with the Head. No, I'm with the head. Banter, that's B, A-- OK, I'll ask. It's Fraser Rowan, generous supporter of the school. Will I be free later? Yes, Fraser, it seems I will be able to join you. OK. Yeah, I'll see you then. All right. Bye. I'm still a bit unclear, Greg. What? Well, were you beavering away a badger, or badgering away a beaver? If you don't mind, I was under some stress. It was a slip of the tongue. Of course it was, Greg. Of course it was. It was a magnificent, an epic, an Olympic slip of the tongue. If Freud wasn't so out of fashion, you'd be locked up already. Oh, great stuff. Thought I was gonna die. Oh. Oh. Oh, dear. Oh dear. Anyway, let's be serious for a minute. Bless me now. Bless me. So you got away with it? Stared into the abyss, and stepped back, I hope. Come on, it happens. Be weird if it didn't. Every year, a new batch, fresher, smarter, healthier. Never stops. It's how you deal with it that matters. You don't need the whole bullshit lecture, do you? Didn't expect to be talking to you like this. Where does it get you? Useless dreams of young unattainable-- no, not just unattainable. Fantasy. Desire in the abstract. The total impossibility of truly possessing another human being. You're touching on the sublime fallacy of love. I never touched anything. I worry about you. No wife. No regular popsy. You spend too much time alone. Your imagination runs riot. What could you offer a wee lassie except confusion? Why can't you get hands on a decent woman, and have a real relationship? Everybody else seems to manage. Think about it. What have you got against ripeness? Ripeness? Bel. Give her a try. She's a fine, smart, ripe woman. I want to see her happy. And you. Grow up. Try the real thing. You could have her-- like that. Wish I could. A real woman. Not inexperienced, could teach you a few tricks. Still young enough to beget too, if you hurry. If you don't mind, I think this is all getting rather personal. Personal? I had to entertain two cops and an incandescent father this morning, right here, because of you. You bet it's bloody personal, boy. I am trying to handle lightly an extremely heavy situation. I hope you appreciate it. Think about it. One thing-- badger and young beaver are out of season as of now. You need a change. In fact, the reason I wanted to see you-- you're underused at that school. And underpaid. You're not stretched. Stretched? I was on the bloody rack today. Hung, drawn and quartered. You could do more. I've had my eye on you. I'm doing a little local positioning. I want to make things happen. I've got plans, projects flying off in all directions. I just need somebody to hold it all together. I want-- You want to be a person of consequence. There you go. You see? You're good with words, and odd ways of looking at things. I want that. Ah, Fraser-- No, no, no, let me explain it. Let me explain it. I planed to talk to you later, but here I am blurting it all out. You see, there's my problem. I've got the goals, I've got the money. I just need a-- a what? What do I need? A witness. There you go. That's an absolutely daft, wild thing to say. But it makes me think. And that's exactly what I need. I'm still thinking, what the fuck do you mean, a witness? Is that vaguely insulting? I'm beginning to get it, the castle, the charity. Could I be looking at the future Sir Fraser Rowan, lord of all hard-ons? Well, it's inevitable. You gotta let them know you're after it, though. No point in being shy. Get a coat of arms over the door. I thought there'd be more to the Fraser Rowan enigma than common gong fever. I need a platform to get things done. People need leaders. You were the same at school, the sensitive fucking. Disconnected, selfish. What do you do to make the world a better place? Huh? I'm having a party next week, big do. I'll send you an invite. We can talk some more, and bring somebody, will you? Well, maybe. I'll see. No, no, no, I mean bring somebody specific for me. The music teacher, Bel. I want to get to know her. Why, how does she fit into your plans? Can't turn up at state functions with an 18-year-old, you know. Anyway, she exudes sensuality, in case you hadn't noticed. She does? She does. A real woman. Help a buddy. Just get her there. I'll do the rest. Well, we'll see. Take it. It's yours. I'll pretend I never saw that. Let's have another edifying chat about guilt real soon, Greg, eh? What are you doing here? Are you trying to get me hung? You've got to go. Come here. God, what have you done, Francis? One human rights activist to go. I found him up the road, just the way you described him. It was too good a chance to miss. I think he's interested. Has nobody ever told you about talking to strangers? Don't I even get a thank you? Yeah, thanks a whole lot, Frances. Just about finished, Joyce, yeah? No. Joyce-- I can take a hint. Bye, Joyce. You argue like lovers. No, no, no, that's my cleaning lady. I meant you and the girl. No again. My name is Dimitri. Greg Underwood. Yah. You have to understand, I'm in a vulnerable position here. Strange girl comes up to me in the street. I have to protect myself. Yes, that's really sore. God, what'd you do that for? Oh, I had to. It will numb for a while. Let me see. Bel, listen, sorry I can't ask you in. I don't think I want to come in. What's going on? You know what they're saying about you? Seems like we got it all wrong. Well, appreciate you coming. Actually, I really do appreciate your coming. I can't say much. I don't know much. But soon, and I promise you you'll be the first to know. I want to tell you everything. Fucking intrigued. OK. Talk to me. I can be your friend if that's all you need from me. Here, listen, Bel-- keep it to yourself for the moment. Thanks for caring. So long, Bel. How many women does it take to run your life? You've got three? And all I've got is that. Doesn't seem fair. It only looks that way, believe me. What's his name? Oh, I don't know. He's a dog. I don't speak dog. I see you read all the right magazines. The New Internationalist, World Alert. You get magazines for everything nowadays. Well, that's me. Mr. Liberal. Fought all the good things, against all of bad. Well, people who have all the good things own the best opinions as well. It's the last little luxury. That's OK. I was in this once. It's Fraser Rowan, isn't it? Go on. We think he's making things, sound machines that hurt people. He ships them out with his charity stuff. They always end up in the same parts of the world. Charity computers. Kids in my country don't have a pencil each. This stuff emits frequencies that make you feel sick. Sick so you want to die. But they've had that for years. New trick is computer monitoring. They wire you up, and then it breaks out the frequencies that disturb you the most. It's interactive. No scars, no bruises. No evidence. Interactive, I hate that word. Torture technology is a growth business. And Fraser Rowan is actually doing this? I was at school with this guy. It's unbelievable. That's why I'm here. To make people believe. To get proof. It won't be easy. Rowan employs hundreds of people. He got millions in government grants to set up here, and they won't blow that. His ass is well-covered. We're fighting the whole system here. Still want to help? Come on, boy. Come on. I was a journalist. A bit too political. Troublemaker. First pair of manacles they put on my legs said Made in England. You remember things like that. I was arrested lots. Tortured. Locked up for months. My family too. Then I-- I lost them. I kind of gave up on a normal life. Come on, boy. Here you go. He always eats the haggis, and leaves his chips. You want some of his? No, thanks. Away you go. Away. No dogs allowed. But he always turns up in the morning. Dimitri! Nice people. Refugees, came here 20 years ago, when the CIA was screwing Chile. They don't go back, but I don't ask why. Whew, wow. I had no idea. The old town's more interesting than you thought, eh? Well, come in and meet them. Ah, another time. Come on, the big world's coming at you. Start connecting. Come and have a drink. No, I need a bath. Need a bath. Impossible. I can't incite people to commit crimes. He wants part numbers, logged, photographed, and samples. I could take those to work. There's a fire door in the kitchen. They use it to nip out for a smoke. It's got. Let him take the risk. That's his job. Well, he's precious. We're expendable. Stop talking like comic book heroes. This is real. It's dangerous. I think you two want to get caught, don't you? Are we doing English today? Or world affairs? English, and lots of it, for your cheek. You best better get on. It's too wild. Let that be a lesson to you. Sorry to bust in. Norman just told me. Are you going to Rowan's big do? Maybe. Have you got a partner? I'd love to go. I'm dying to have a look at this place. Well, it's tricky, Bel. Pretty formal. I think security will be tight. Don't get your hopes up. And to be frank, Bel, as a close friend of yours, Fraser Rowan's not the kind of guy you want to be hanging around with. Believe me, I know him. He's not your type at all. No soul, no warmth to the man. He preys on women. Seen him do it. Greg, I just want to see his front room. The video compressor reports I interrupt up the peak to peak video signal, and patch it through a multi-plexer before it's digitized. It's easy. I've been teaching you English for five years. What went wrong? Frances, you tell me. It gives him a readout of the security video. We don't appear on the screens. Why couldn't you say that? I did. Wear something loose. A dark track suit. We? Forget it. Not a chance. Not a chance. Ssh. Look, I am giving you no encouragement to do this. I'm against it. Oh, you're full of crap. You're the one that lives in a world of fiction. When the facts hit you, you run. Go easy on him, Frances. I can take care of myself, Doug. Whatever she says, she doesn't mean it. Oh, you think you're a fucking hero just because you read the right newspaper. And your Oxfam Christmas cards, and your wee Amnesty badge. You even wear it under your lapel. What are you, closet Amnesty? Oh, you hypocrite. You feed us with all your consent crap and then don't do a thing about it. And your UN pens? You're nothing but an old badge collector. OK. Dark track suit. Many badges Doug, for that, you know. Did your multiplexer thing? Oh, god. I didn't see a badge on that one, Doug. Doug, is there a badge on that one? Would you take that bloody hood down? You got the code? He said he gave you a code. Is that why I'm here? You could have asked me for that? Just open the door. OK. And six for a conviction. Voila. Should be clean. Right, come on. Well, here we are. We did it. Feeling OK? - Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, let's do what we have to do and get out of here. Multiple pulser p-- This is it. Bio-effects experiments. It's the same stuff here, Doug. I'm taking these. Come and see this. Rowan Electronics audio test chamber. It's a. Wow. Makes you feel sick, doesn't it? That's the idea. Hello? Fraser, hi! Nothing special. Where am I? I'm just over at a friend's place. The party, yeah, I got the invite. Uh-huh. Bel, yep. Working on her. Um, now, you know the formal thing. What should I wear? Well, just come as you are, Greg. On second thoughts, don't take me too literally. I mean, I don't want you turning up in an old track suit or something, eh? Track suit? Yeah, good one. No, no, no. Well, listen. I've really got to go. I'll just see you there. - See you there. - Yeah all right. OK. - Bye. Yeah, bye. Bye. For fuck's sake. What did he say about a track suit? No, it was nothing, nothing, nothing, really. I think. Hey, come on. Let's get this done, get out of here, yeah? Doug, you're sure you've taken care of all the cameras? Absolutely. Unless he's got a high speed ISDN system, with a digital-- Talk English. A hidden camera. It's possible. Quick, get out of here! Someone coming! Quick, Doug, get away with the stuff. Greg! Open this door! I'm sorry. Ow. I'm really sorry. You're not supposed to be here. I just came for a look. Now stick it in. Through the nail. Now let's blow it out. no, I can't. Here, give me that. No pain. Feeling better already. Just don't want to lose the nails. On my third set on this hand now. And I don't know how many I get. Good. Well done. Thanks a lot. So what will you do next? All I can do is file the evidence. What does that mean? It goes in the annual report. Violations of the Human Rights Agreement in International Trade. Published every April in 16 languages. It's a big book, about this thick. But who reads it? Well, it's not a bestseller. It will be quoted at a few conferences, can promise you that. And that's that? What you do here is up to you. This one's yours now. Haven't you learned anything? Rattle some cages. Hold a grudge. Think about it. Maybe some mindless vandalism. Well, the throbbing has stopped now. But-- Think might have broken a few? I'll take you to the hospital. You two better get home. Well done. I'll watch your factory full time. They'll move the stuff. We've stopped them for a while. This is unbe-fucking-livable. Last week, I was seducing schoolgirls, and now I'm a sadomasochist. If this is a confession, you're going to have to slow down. Tom's a slow writer. Was that a joke? Is that meant to be a joke? Would you sit down, please? Look, we don't handle stuff like this very often. Sorry if we appear a bit insensitive. So where did you boys first meet? A club? Are you trying to be provocative? I'm dealing with facts here. The hospital are obliged to report unusual injuries, broken fingers, bones, plus his old scars. Has sado-masochism got a hyphen? When is this going to end? Is this whole thing a joke to you? I'm the one with the injuries. Why don't you talk to me? My old scars are the result of four years detention and interrogation in my own country. I'm on a lecture tour of various European cities, on human rights and state repression. You have my document. I don't think a pass for Leyden University library gives you complete freedom to roam the world at will Mr. Dimitri, or to enter this country. But we'll see. You got mad. It was great to watch. You've got a fighter's instincts. Yeah, well, that's not funny. They just twisted everything I said. That's not funny. But now you know what it's like to be trapped, to be powerless. For the truth to mean nothing. You said it. To be a joke. Nothing. Now you know. Now you know. A library ticket? OK, boys. I have to lie to cops, I can't help it. When they start checking, I'm finished. Don't try and help. Keep your distance. When even British cops make me feel like this, maybe it's time to quit. Mr. Underwood, you can go for now. We'll be in touch. Those kids-- see it through for their sake. They've got to believe they can make a difference. Don't worry. We're going to cause a fuss. Well, Rowan might be squeezed a bit. But don't expect any miracles. Remember, though-- Yeah, hold a grudge. Don't you worry. First thing tomorrow at the government, Edinburgh. And sorry about your hand. Something to remember you by in years to come. You're lethal, man. I'm not giving you the finger. It just looks that way. God, what are you doing here? He's gone. Do you get it? Do you understand what I'm saying? Gone. It's just us now. God, what am I doing? I'm talking to a dog. Don't speak dog. So what we do now? Hello? Bel, it's Greg Who? Greg. I'm amazed, amazed to find myself at your door. I went home, I couldn't go now. I was like, lonely and scared. And I was elated and deflated. The things that have happened-- I wanted to tell someone. So I thought, my dad! Then I thought no. Then I thought, Bel. I want to tell Bel. And that's the truth. I want to tell you. I said I would, and here I am. I've met people. I've done things that I could never have dreamed of. And I'm scared. But you don't Bel. Although now that you mention it, let's talk about that too. Let's talk about all of these things. I haven't had a bath, though. Bel? It doesn't close. It's an incredible story. Bit garbled. Well, you relaxed me so much, couldn't concentrate. So what do I do? Well, you need to just unwind tonight. Yeah, well you've achieved that. What was that you did to me? Oh, it was highly complex. I rubbed your shoulders. It's called human contact. Right, well, works. It goes on from there. Right. Think we should? Greg, I don't know. Maybe you should try your dad's Yeah, well, it's awful late. Very hard to wake. How long have we been friends? Eight years. You know, in all the time, we've never touched. Not even a brush of the hand. Not even a kiss at Christmas. We have avoided physical contact. How weird. I've noticed, actually. Know why that is? I do. Sexual tension's been there all the time, underneath like a time bomb. We've both felt it. I've just been scared to do anything about it. Really? Yeah. Truth is, I'm feeling quite aroused tonight. Take the surprise out of your voice. No, no, no. I've got definite feelings. Well, keep me posted. You'll be the first to know. In fact, I think we should kiss this very unhealthy friendship goodbye right now. Do you mean to tell me all these years, you have never had one single wee erotic thought about me? Not one. Honest, Bel, I couldn't. It was my subconscious telling me not to. Oh, well as long as it wasn't your fault. No, no, no. It was my subconscious. Does your subconscious want the light off? Yeah. Well, maybe a torch. Bel. My god. Look at you, you're beautiful. Look at you! There's still a wee touch of the old friendship in your voice, Greg. You're going to have to lose that. I'm sorry. But it's just so incredible. I like you looking at me. I like this lamp. It's an early Christmas present. I thought we'd be getting round to this by then. Christmas? Mm-hmm So we're ahead of schedule. Yes. So you can take your time. Well, can't promise you certain amounts of foreplay, Bel. Is this going to be our thing, talking through sex? Sorry, it's just my nerves. Oh, fucking shut up. I mean it. Not another word. Not unless it's totally filthy. Hi. It's nice to be here. - You sound surprised. It's a day off, too. So it is. But I've got things to do. Big day today. I'm going to Edinburgh as well. I feel very close to you. Yeah, something's happened. I'm actually glad I'm here. Normally, I don't like the mornings. No post-coital depression. I'm surprised. Touch last night. But it vanished like lightning. Amazing, don't you think? Well, don't get too sentimental. Let's get a few good times in before we get dewy-eyed. God, you're so heartless. Last night was wonderful. Got to keep these nails trimmed in future. That is very important. You have lovely long fingers. Did you ever play an instrument? No. You could teach me. Right. Lesson one, a simple exercise for one arm, that you can practice alone. Ooh, Bel, bella Bel. Bel, let's play a duet. What did you do to him last night? Me? Nothing. You wouldn't believe it. A second ago, Bel and me. Hugging, kissing, the lot. If you'd just come out of there two seconds ago. Bel and I. There's lots of kissing. Oh, shit. This is the government. You might have made a bit of an effort. I did. This is an effort. Cheek. We're grateful for your sense of responsibility, and your courage in coming to us, and volunteering the information that you have. All I can ask you is to be patient, and obviously treat everything in the strictest confidence. In simple language, not a word to a living soul. And let's use a generous definition of living soul to include especially members of the press. But we've supplied evidence, physical proof on the table. Proof of what? We don't yet know. Where's the crime? Rowan Electronics is a government-sponsored research facility. They have license to get up to all sorts of things. We have your version of events as a starting point, and your confession. You illegally entered Rowan's premises, right? With pupils under your care. That's the bit that worries me, frankly. But he didn't report a break in. So what's he hiding? Well, Rowan is simply being responsible for their official duties. Keeping quiet. Telfor, hello. I just popped in to remind you of your duty under the Official Secrets Act, to which you are now both bound, having discussed with us this morning matters of national security. You can't talk about any of this, understood? Good. Now I'm not of a mind to involve the education department at this stage, are you, dear? Although we should. Oh, and Underwood, you're not the only one annoyed at Fraser Rowan. I didn't get an invite to his party, did you? I don't just have a duty to your official secrets. I'm a citizen of this country. I have rights, the right to know what's going on in my name, with my taxes, in my town. Correction, Underwood. Not a citizen, a subject of Her Majesty the Queen. Your rights are in the gift of the Crown, and its appointed government. Your allegiance is to her, technically speaking. In fact, for certain things, she can still hang you if she wishes. For the moment, dear, for the nonce. Scotland will be a nation once again. Went good, I think. How'd I do? That good, eh? Had them worried a bit, at the end. I missed that. Must of blanked. Well, you were quiet enough. Didn't want to spoil your flow. Thanks very much. There you go. Will I come back for you? Eh, no, no, no. I'll be OK. Thanks a lot. I might anyway. Your invitation, sir. Well, now-- now I did-- I'm sure it was-- - Hi there. It's all right. He's a friend of Mr. Rowan's. Natasha, right? Yes, that's right. If you want to go straight ahead, there's food and drink in the marquee, OK? Thank you. The Rowan girls. What are you two doing here? We're getting 50 pounds for this. Care to take one? Well, I hope you finished your homework. Don't spectate, participate. Greg. Sorry about the other day. I didn't recognize you. Last time I saw you, you were in your school uniform. Still got that. Still fits. What, the wee? Do you still wear that? No, just for fun now. On special request. But with stockings. Don't like tights. Well, we have something in common already. Oh, you found each other. You're spoiling all my surprises. Don't worry, she won't disappear. She's a very giving girl, Greg. Take it from me. To recoin your own exquisite phrase. So, you and a bunch of kids are saving the world, eh? Well, you're not going to ruin mine. Wait, wait, wait, slow down, Fraser. What are you up to? You're the one that's got to explain yourself. To you? To you and the girls and boys of 5B? Greg, you are a schooly in cheap shoes. Do your worst. Oh, come on. That wee girl has got you jumping through hoops. It's unnecessary. Jan's out there. With her, you make the running. Or is that your problem, Greg? You need your tongue hanging out, as well as your dick? Don't be so disgusting. You can't even handle the words, can you? Or reality. And what do you know about hard choices? The week after they invented the wheel, someone was tied to one, believe me. That's technology. Would you listen to yourself, Fraser? Listen to what you are saying. Look that is me, out there, doing things in this big world that you just agonize over. You know of these kids-- they walk two hours to school, and then two hours home again, hungry. What are you doing for them? Do you know how a simple computer can help a bush hospital? Do you-- do you care? You just stay in your simple world, Greg. You're a fine teacher, no doubt. And there's nothing wrong with kids being exposed to contrary views, as long as you're not forcing anything more than your trite opinions on them, eh? Yeah, because I had to vouch for you in some very high places today. They had you down as a full-blown pervert, not to mention a tartan terrorist. I said you didn't have the guts to be either. Be nice to keep an eye on you, though. - A - thin-legged little donkey with a shaggy belly. I worry about you, Fraser. I really do. I think there's something missing in you, a wee human bit. You know, every time I see you, you're in a different costume. But just series of acts. You don't exist as a person. You walk into an empty room-- do you know what? It stays empty. That's why you need an old castle, because you're a ghost, Fraser. Empty. I'll take that as a regretful refusal of my job offer, then. Have your fling if you must. But the person that brings me down won't be wearing Romanian loafers. You look after yourself. And I mean that. Take care. Good night, sweet ladies. Hello? Hi. Yeah, yep, yep. Right, you stay. I'll be there. Mr. Underwood, Mr. Fraser would like you to have use of the car, to take you into town, or wherever you're going. Mr. Underwood, Mr. Fraser would like you to have use of the car, to take you into town, or wherever you're going. Oh, deja vu. Is that a nightclub? Thanks very much, lads, but no. This one's mine. I thought I'd come back. Genius. Thanks very much. Some do up there. Were you the entertainment? Didn't get too many laughs. Timing, isn't it? You either got it or you haven't. You guys just won't give up, will you? They're moving the stuff. So that's that. Rowan's won. Wait, slow down, slow down. Dimitri told us it would be like this. This one's yours now, he said. Yeah, well, this one is ours now. Nothing's going to happen unless we make it happen. Mindless vandalism? His very words, Doug. Now you're thinking. Well, let's fight dirty. You guys stay here, OK? I'll be right back. You don't drag a hog out the river in your best trousers. That's an American phrase. Hello? Bel, it's me. I need your car. I can't explain, but I need your car. You can have it for a shag. What, now? 'Fraid so. On delivery. I've hardly any time, like 15 minutes, tops. Twice as long as you needed last night. You're absolutely right. OK. Oh, come on, open the door. Oh, first, son. You're in a hurry. All right, thanks. Right, I'm off. OK, take the phone. I'll check in. Christ, I don't know my number. But I do. Out, Frances, out. I am not involving you in this. - Try and stop me. Can you open the door for me please? Doug, not a good idea. What? This is it, the big moment. Not a good idea, Doug. I'll explain later. Take the phone and wait here. All right. Right, you two go off. I'll stay. Take the phone. Now that's nice. Oh well. Got terrible taste, your girlfriend. It's Miss Jordan to you. So you admit it? Don't get cocky. Just concentrate and play. Get your seat belt on. You're doing this for me and Doug, aren't you? Actually, do you know what? No. I'm doing this for me. Thanks anyway. Got any money? I know where we're going. If I'm wrong, I'll eat Miss Jordan's tapes. Help yourself. I knew it. Rowan's got. What do we do? Well, it doesn't leave till 6:00 in the morning. Plenty of time to think. It's dangerous now, isn't it? Only if we do something. We could always drive home. But we won't, will we? Oh, don't worry. If they lock you up after all this, I'll wait for you. Girl, you've no idea what those words mean to me. Only trouble is-- What? They might lock you up too. They're right behind me. They're in the corner. So we've spent the night together. Looks like it. There's something we have to do. There is. I want to. You do? We have to. Do we? Hello, mum? Hi. I'm sorry. Yeah, I thought you would be. No, I'm fine, honest. But listen, can I stay out tonight? If I know it. Well, I'm going to be late. Quite a bit. No, no, later than that. No, later. Because I'm quite far away. Hello, mom? No, no, it's not hundreds of miles. How far away are we? Mom, it was only a three-hour drive. No, of course I'm not alone. Stop worrying. We've done something really special, actually. It's been going on for ages, but tonight was the climax. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. Me and Mr. Underwood. My English teacher. Yeah, that one. Mom, calm down. He's a grown man. I don't-- I can't tell you on the phone. Oh, but it's great what we did. No, I want to tell you face to face. Mom, don't make a fuss. I just want to say good night. Right, hold on. She wants to speak to you. Mrs. McCannce, hello, it's nice to-- yes, well, no, you're quite right. It does seem like a strange thing to be-- well, we haven't finalized the sleeping arrangements yet. Sometimes, the strangest thing has the simplest explanation. No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think there's any real need for me to talk to your husband right now. As I said, we're just-- no, no, no, Mrs. McCannce. No, no, no. Mr. McCance hello. How are you? It's nice to-- well, things aren't always what they seem. I give you my personal assurance that Francis is in perfectly safe hands. No, I don't mean anything by that. I just mean this just perfectly safe, and she's in my-- you should be very proud of her. Nothing to do with badgers. No, not a badger in sight. It's just the-- Dad, calm down. No, nothing's wrong. Look, I phoned you. Please let me explain tomorrow, OK? I'm going to put the phone down now. Calm down. One, two, three. Jesus Christ. Your father and I just cannot seem to hit it off. Is he like that with everyone? Only people that kidnap his daughter. What about you? You got any calls to make? Hi, it's me. Oh, yeah. A lot. Big lot. Um, well, maybe not quite as big as that. My green jacket and blue trousers. Why, what are you wearing? Are the curtains closed? Well, I don't know that I can say that out loud right now. God. No, now, no more solos. Duets from now own. Practice together. No, I do that now. Sorry. I had to do it. - Don't apologize. No, it was quick thinking. What now? Don't really see that truck getting on that boat. What do you always say, don't spectate, participate? See if one more person says that to me. Well, what do you want to do? We're two smart people. We should be able to come up with something. He put the keys in the right hand coat pocket. How did you see that? I can kiss with my eyes open. Good. Well observed. Let's keep playing to our strengths. Any other talents? I'm good at crying. What are you good at? Go! Go, go, go! Quick! Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. But what with madam's car? Oh, dear, yeah. Well, that's a problem for the future. If there is a future. What do you think? I wonder what it'll feel like. Do you want to? Let's do it. You go first. No, no. No, no, no. Let's do it together. Whoa! Ooh! Whoo! keyboard shot. Check my back, will you? I think I've pulled a muscle. No, get my shirt up. I've really hurt it. Eh, nah, nah, nah. We should go. - No. - We should go. Some sleep before we drive. Well, we did it. Something. Yeah. Yeah, you're some girl, Frances. Just some girl? Some girl. Look as us. 200 miles from home, parents going insane, calling the police, the headmaster, don't know who all. The army probably. Let's not even think about Fraser. And all because you cared about something. And then to do something about it. Ordinary people don't get this close to making things happen. Now I've gone from some girl to ordinary. Now, ordinary you're not. You taught me. You can think you believe things, but it doesn't count until you test them. You made me earn some easily held opinions. No, you've taught me that. No, you taught me that. You really like me, don't you? Hello? How could I go through what I have with you if I didn't like you? I used to fancy you, you know. First year. - No. - I was crazy about you. Well, me and Laura, actually. If I'd have thought I would up in the back of a van with you on a Friday night. Big Laura? Yeah. Hmm. You nearly broke my heart. Laura with the curly hair? Would you shut up about Laura? Well, I'm glad you got all that nonsense out of your system so early on. Glad you got over me. Well, you have to. You know that. Doug could have helped us shift this thing. Why did you leave him behind? Thought you would have worked it out by now. This is it for us. Definitely no future. Face it. Hijack, robbery, destroying property, abduction. Abduction? Well, I've got to protect myself. Come here. Make no mistake about it, you'll go down for a long time. You'll be like Gandhi. He used to sleep next to naked young virgins to test his will power. That was his excuse, was it? The light's your side. OK. So-- I've said my piece. You're amazing. And that's that. That will do. OK. Good night, Mr. Underwood. It's not Mr. Underwood. It's Greg.
