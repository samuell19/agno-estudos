(LOW DRONE) (THE SOUNDS OF DEEP SPACE) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (BOBBY SIGHS) (POIGNANT MUSIC) BOBBY: Remember when you were a little kid and some adult told you to enjoy being young, because you'll grow up really fast and be old before you know it? You didn't believe them, did you? But then one day, you wake up in a panic and realize they were right. (CLOCK TICKING) (WATER SPLASHING) (BOBBY GROANS) Elon Musk says we're all living in a simulation designed by an advanced civilization, some alien race out there using our misery for entertainment, conspiring against us, just to watch us struggle and fail. (ELECTRONIC TONES CHIRPING) (DICE RATTLING) Are we all just a bunch of ones and zeroes? (MUSIC SWELLS) (BOBBY PANTS) (BOBBY SIGHS) (DOG BARKING) (CHAIN RATTLING) Kyle, I know these guys. They're high-end, they're local, and it is cheaper to buy it by the case. It's too expensive. I'll take three. I'm not saving enough. Bobby, are you okay? Yeah. I live not too far. 3:59, Bob, cutting it close. Well, thank you, I am really excited to get you those three bottles. I'll see you soon. You're lookin' good today. Love that suit. Well, thanks. Bigshot Bobby, happy birthday, bro. Don't remind me. Dude, how come you didn't text me back last week? Hey, Bobby, I wanna talk to you. Just a little heads up, the house is gonna be taking 50% now of our pooled tips. You can't do that. Just did. You said for the winter months. Yeah, I know what I said. Yeah. Well, Kyle, it's springtime. That's the way it is, boys, okay. You should be grateful that you have a job. I would be. Grateful. Great, you guys are great. He's getting harder and harder to ignore. Exactly why I hit you up, but you didn't text me back. Hey, Carlos, Kyle said we're using the other olive oil for the entrees now. What do you mean? That's not olive oil, man. It's a blend. I know, but the real stuff is gone. CARLOS: (GROWLS) Kyle. TELEVISION: Authentic Italian cuisine, right here in Phoenix. - Hey, Tanya. - Hey. Back for more fun? Right. Let's see, Hearts Creed over ice. Ooh, I'll have a thoughtful bartender. Kyle and these goddamn pour restrictors. I can't even pour a decent drink. Such a douche. You know he's ordering single bottles now? I know, I told him. This place is doomed. Maybe I'll join you. (TANYA LAUGHS) TELEVISION: Locally owned and operated. BOBBY: So I hope it's not hurting your accounts. Nah, it's all right. I'm not gonna be slingin' booze forever. How long you been dealing with him? Five years. TANYA: Jesus. Yeah. Cheers, dude. Mm. Oh. TANYA: Like candy. It is so good. You know, I use this for grilling. Put it on cauliflower. Little red onion, little salt and pepper. And then I make this really amazing Cajun cream sauce. It's so yummy. Mm, that sounds ridiculous. It is ridiculous. Well, I don't really cook like I used to. My place isn't really set up for it. No? - No, it's... - Well, you have place, so. I do, but it's small. Yeah, my place is pretty small. I mean, it's a three-bedroom. It's on a beautiful piece of property, but. You're on a gorgeous piece of property. I was there for your birthday last November. That's right, you were there. It was a very nice night. MARIO: Hey, hey. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Oh, Mario, Bobby. - My man. - Hey. Pleasure. Look at that 'stache. That is a good 'stache. Isn't that great? - Here you go. - Oh, no, no. Tanya and I are old friends. It's all right, keep it anyway. And bring us a really nice rose, Bobby. Will do, coming right up. Shall we? TANYA: I like it. (TELEVISION DRONING SOFTLY) TELEVISION: Right here in Phoenix. (LIGHT UPBEAT MUSIC) Thank you. Now, see, I like this guy, Bobby. Most people in this world, they're all smoke, no fire. But not this guy. I can see it. I can feel your heat, my man. You're burning me up. Or is that Tanya? Yeah, that's you. Doesn't she look resplendent? Like a goddamn sunrise. - Thank you. - You keep that up, I'm gonna have to put these on in here. (TANYA LAUGHS) (CELLPHONE BUZZES) Investor. It's all good news, baby. Si, soy Mario. Where'd you find him? He's a venture capitalist. So you're mixing business with pleasure? Very tricky, like vodka and Red Bull. That's disgusting, and no. I mean, you know, maybe. But I don't know. It's not, I mean, I could. - I'd have to... - You're just makin' up - as you go along. - Just gonna figure it out. Forgive me. How's Bobby's rose? It's so good. It's dry, it's fruit-forward. It's got citrus notes. It's not too sweet. All right, let's see. Mm. Yeah, strawberry, notes of citrus. I mean, you have a beautiful palate, Tanya. Can I get you started on any appetizers? You give us a minute, please? (LIVELY MUSIC) Hey! (CROWD APPLAUDING) BLADE: Later, Bobby. (BOBBY SIGHS) (BOLD MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC) BOBBY: My life really does feel like a farce written by aliens. Like these fish. A waitress I went out with a couple of times was moving away, and she asked me to adopt them. I told her I'd think about it. And then the next thing you know, she brings 'em over and sets up the tank. (FAN RATTLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (FAN RUMBLING) (MESSAGE WHOOSHING) What you doin', man? BOBBY: Hi, man. You ready for this? Dark roast, extra cream and sugar, the way you like it. Thanks, man. So what's been going on, bro. How's the comic book going? It's a graphic novel. Is it done? It's languishing unfinished. Oh, man. I thought when you moved into your sweet mama's trailer you said you'd be able to focus. Thought by now you'd makin' bank, signing autographs at the Comic-Con, royalties from alien figurines. Hey, Bobby, I'm sorry. This is good. This is exactly what I'm trying to get to. You don't have time to write or draw because you're wasting your nights workin' your ass off at Kyle's terrible restaurant. But here's the thing, man. It wouldn't matter if I had a different situation, 'cause everything's predetermined. No, no, no. Don't you be blaming the aliens again, bro. My mom used to say (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE). Everyone creates their own destiny. Do me a favor, Bobby. Close your eyes for a minute. Come on, just do it. Close your eyes. Good. Now, deep breath. (EXHALES DEEPLY) And I want you to go deep, way down. You feel that? Your passion is still there, Bobby. I can feel it squirming beneath all those failures, all those regrets. This is supposed to help me, right? Yeah. Come on, close your eyes. Do it. (BOBBY GROANS) Okay. I want you to visualize what you'll be doing 10 years from now. Can you see it? Not working for Kyle at least. No. What would your mama want for you? You were her beneficiary. She left you that crib, that beautiful Airstream, and she left you a nice little chunk of change. Oh, is that what this is about? Yeah, I mean, what would your mom want you to do with those 50 Gs that you're just sitting on? I mean, it was supposed to be for Nikki and mean, and then for my mom's hypothetical grandchildren. No, fuck that, bro. Nikki's gone, life goes on. That's your nest egg now. Mom wanted you to be happy. I thought about livin' off that money, you know, rollin' along with it. But I can't just burn through all that cash and have nothing to show for it. I can respect that. But think about this. Why not use that cash to create a new life for yourself? I mean, that's what I'm doing. I've been saving my money. (ASSERTIVE MUSIC) Woo. Yeah. Look at this. Are you serious? You kidding me? It's like the castle of our dreams. Can you see it? Neon bowling ball, neon pins falling down. What do you think? I think you've lost your mind. No, you're not visualizing it, Bobby. What do you remember about this place? Bowling. Okay, yeah, what else? Come on, man, close your eyes. You're not visualizing. Just do it. Okay, what do you remember? Birthday parties. Good, yes, bein' a kid. Running free, eating cake. Playing "Donkey Kong" with your stupid buddies. What else do you remember? (WISTFUL MUSIC) Drivin' around with Nikki in her mom's yellow '87 Camaro. I don't know. CARLOS: Come on, close your eyes. I'm not closin' my eyes anymore. I feel like an idiot. Okay, all right, all right. We'll see how this makes you feel. Huh? Bowling 300 in your senior year, you remember that? Before it was Bigshot Bobby, he was 300 Hoffy. Shit, I had just moved here. I couldn't even speak English. But my best friend is the high school bowling champ. Kind of raised my stock. Come on, I'll show you what really gets me goin'. And no more about Nikki, bro, okay. This is now. Oh, wow. Yeah. Now I see what you're talking about. It's beautiful. All right, just hear me out. No, this is perfect. It could be. You see, Bobby, by keeping this place closed, we're depriving all the children of Phoenix of all those sweet memories you were talkin'. Wouldn't wanna deprive 'em of this place. You fix up the bar here. Your choices, anything you like. Oregon craft beer, Oregon wines. You're a tastemaker, Bobby. You always have been. Keep your mind open. I'm gonna show you my sanctum sanctorum and exactly why this enterprise is gonna work. Check this out. This is it, baby. This is where the magic happens, huh. Beautiful or what? Don't worry, everything in here will be cleaned and restored. BOBBY: Greasy chicken strips. French fries, milkshakes. Ranch dressing, mm. You know me better than that. Okay, check this out. Napoletano pizza pies that compete with the best in the world, all the dough made fresh daily with these hands. (WATER DRIPPING) I think it's a dump. (DOOR SLAMS) Oh, that's it, you could roll. I remember. It's a completely useless talent. Yeah, well, that useless talent is gonna save this place from becoming a Dollar Store. Look at this. Rising Phoenix. Come for the pizza, stay for the bowling. Or come for the bowling, stay for the pizzas. Oh, but you haven't tasted my pies. But you will, bro. You'll see. Oh! See, that's a sign. Your aliens made you throw that strike. How come you didn't tell me about this place earlier? I didn't wanna jinx it, you know. I'm saving my cash. Come on, I wanna show you somethin' else. (DOOR RATTLES) BOBBY: Play room. CARLOS: It's your office. Where's your office? Kitchen's my office. But this is yours. Come on, eat and bowl for free. You need a day off, take one, because you'd be an owner. Man, think about it. Well, I have to admit, it actually sounds kind of amazing. But then I think, this has gotta be the stupidest fuckin' idea you ever had. All right. Well, you know what should really freak you out? Getting old. Not going after your dreams when you had a chance. Watching your life slip away, and then you die. Oof. Okay, well, let's keep it positive. Imagine being an owner, drawing your comics whenever you want. No more Kyle, bro. No more bow ties. (ASSERTIVE MUSIC) (SCOFFS) Damn it. CARLOS: Hey, so tomorrow night, I got my first investor meeting, man. You coming? (GROANS) I don't know, Carlos. I mean, I'd really like nothing more than the say fuck you to Kyle. Yes. Hey. Hey, Bobby. Hey. Do you have something you wanna say to me? No. No? Nope. Oh, I thought you... I was just talking to Carlos about your new oil. The new oil? New oil, well, what about it, Carlos? We can't use it anymore. It's a compromise I'm not okay with. But we're already using it. But Kyle... But Kyle. (WHINES) It affects the taste, man. It affects the taste. (GRUMBLES) Look, an oil blend might save money... Oh, it saves money. But it's like pouring hot water in your latte. I think you're totally overreacting. Blade made me today's special with the new olive oil. It was delicious. It's not an olive oil. Quit calling it that. It's a blend that fucks with the taste, all right! (CHUCKLES) I love when Carlos gets mad. His eyes pop out like my pet iguana. Goddamn it, Bobby, where's your bow tie? I guess I forgot it. Oh, I forgot it, Kyle. Yeah, sorry, Kyle. All right. Okay. You stay right there. (DOOR CREAKS) It's your lucky day. Here you go. You're gonna pay for this. 15 bucks comes outta the top of your tips. Seems a little high. It's almost cost. What do you say? Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, Kyle. There it is. That was nice. Okay. You're welcome. Man, I almost threw my apron in his face and bailed tonight, bro. 18 bucks on a Saturday night. Disgrace. It's time, my friend. Look, I know tomorrow's our day off, but why don't you just drop by. Come check it out. I mean, we're goin' up to my nephew Rudy's place up at the lake. He's got this great kitchen. We'll talk some business, eat some pies, drink some wine. Come on. I'll be there. That's it, baby. Okay, I'll text you the address. Seven o'clock, don't forget. Woo! (UPBEAT MUSIC) BOBBY: I met Nikki at Christmas mass. I saw her at the top of the cathedral steps.

Carlos, I thought we were gonna talk a little business. We are, Bobby. That's exactly what we're doing. Now, my tomato sauce is slow-cooked and full-bodied. It comes from the meaty and juicy heirloom tomatoes grown in San Marzano, ripening in the rich volcanic soil of Mount Vesuvius. Oh, I love that deep red color. Look at that. Yes. Rich. A great tomato sauce has zest. I love that word because it means energy. Fresh crushed peppers and garlic, Sicilian oregano, cracked peppercorn, and just enough sea salt to lock in the taste so it stays zesty and delicious. Fresh roasted garlic, Parmigiano-Reggiano. House-cured pancetta. Now this goes into a hot oven. Wild arugula. I call this this one the Elisa, after my mother. Because it's a thing of great beauty. En paz descansa. Mm. Get out your dictionary. Look up holy fuck. Oh, man. (LIVELY MUSIC) (CROWD CHATTERING) (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) So are Rudy and Marie investing? No, but I think they could advise us. They've done really well with their two taquerias, and they're thinking of opening a third location. So I think they'd be down to help us. Thought about askin' my dad to be a third investor, but nah, I don't wanna risk his money. I mean, he's but picking on the farms for over 40 years. Plus, you know, I don't want anybody lookin' over my shoulder second-guessing. I wanna be left alone with the menu. So who's the third investor? Mario Bentley Jr. He's this new venture capitalist in town. Hmm. That guy, yeah, he's the guy that was dancin' with Tanya the other night, right? Yeah, did you meet him? Yeah, I met him. CARLOS: What? He's kind of a one-percenter, isn't he? He's been really successful. Carlos, I don't want another Kyle tellin' me I gotta wear a bow tie. Mario's hands-off, bro. He's not like that. He's a great guy. The only reason he's even in town is for this cannabis thing. He's usually flyin' around the world somewhere. So I think he's goin' to Dubai. He's gonna be gone for a few months. Why isn't he here now? Because I didn't invite him. Because this is about you and me, Bobby. That's it. Look, I'm in. I already signed the lease. I didn't wanna take a chance on losing the property, so once Mario said he was in, I just went ahead and secured it myself. What if I don't invest? Well, then I have to find a new partner. But that's not something that I can control. This place, it's my destiny, Bobby. I know it is. I'm excited about this angel investor, but you're the guy that I've always wanted to be my everyday business partner. I wasn't convinced, until I tasted those pies of yours, man. I'm in. Serious?

TELEVISION: With red wine and rosemary. Finished with roasted garlic. You think I wouldn't notice an expensive bottle going empty? How stupid do you think I am? Well, I think you're pretty stupid. You're fired! You can't fire me. I quit! You can't quit after being fired. That doesn't make any sense. You're stupid. I'm stupid? Hey! Bobby, Bobby, be cool. He ain't worth it. If you even touched, I mean, brushed against my coat, I would have you up on assault charges. You know what, Carlos, you're also fired. My resignation's already on your desk. Yeah, but I didn't see it. So technically, I fired you before you quit. Whatever, as long as I don't have to cook here anymore. Blade, good timing. You are the new interim head chef. Wait, what's going on? These two geniuses are opening up a pizza parlor/bowling alley. What else are you gonna be selling, live bait? Lotto tickets? You gonna put in a gas pump? Maybe some video poker machines? That's classy. Come with us, I'll show you how to cook some real food. I don't know, Carlos. Being the head chef is a pretty good opportunity for me, man. Damn right, it is. CARLOS: Come on, Bobby, let's go. Hey. Let me give you a warning. This is a fucking hard business. You can't trust anybody. I learned that. That was smart. (GRITTY UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey! Hey, oh, there she is, the deal-maker. Oh, my god, you're in? - Really? - Yeah, I'm done with Kyle. I'm done with Kyle. Congratulations. Yeah, it's kind of amazing how this is all coming together. Yeah. Are you goin' over there? - Yeah. - Of course. Yeah. So how much cash does Mario have? Oh, he's swimming in cash. This pot deal is serious, trust me. Right. So are you goin' out with him? No. Why? Well, I mean, I just thought, you know, since we're gonna be partners, I just thought I should know. Well, I dig him, but I mean, it's nothing. I mean, he's a player. But that's what makes him kind of fun, so. Sure. (LAUGHS) Are you jealous? No, no. Yeah, totally, actually. He's a pretty intimidating guy. Maybe I should learn how to salsa dance, or. Yeah, well, maybe you should. You should probably get a few new moves in there now. (BOTH LAUGH) Bowling alley owner. BOBBY: Yeah. All right. (MARIO SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) - Hey. - Hey. (MARIO SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) Woo, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby. Makin' money just makes me want - to move my body. - (LAUGHS) Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And ya brought the boys. Carlos, my man, how are you? - Bobby. - Good to see you, sir. Yeah. Guys, I'm sure you're wonderin', thank you very much, what the hell I'm doin' in Southern Oregon. I came here to get my hands around that billion dollar weed industry, right. And now that that's done, our little venture here, it's mostly for fun. But I gotta say, man, we are diggin' your concept. Great, 'cause we, the concept is, you know, we, that... Beer and bowling go hand in hand. Alcohol by itself, now that's a business. But you throw in these delicious pies and the fact that Carlos's world-class dough only costs pennies to make, come on. This is not steak and seafood, right, this is mom and pop. The markup on a pizza, baby, that's where it's at. Oh, you know, - I love your enthusiasm, sir. - Oh, yeah. And thank you, Mario, for your willingness to back us. Up until this point, I've been finding this thing willy-nilly, as you like to say. But now we have official paperwork. Speaking of. - All right, gentlemen. - Here it is. Here we go. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) (GROUP CHEERING) Congratulations. MARIO: All right, cheers. Congratulations, guys. CARLOS: Woo! To Mario, thank you. You got this, Hoffy. Where's Mario? Oh, he's on with Tokyo again. But he's wiring his money anyway. Thank you, sir. Here's my balance. Money already spent in QuickBooks.

Classic Brunswick A2 pinsetter made back in the '60s. Good machine. Just needs a little TLC. Well, that's great news. So Carlos and I were wondering, since they're probably all gonna need a little work, could you give us a break on the price? Nah. Well, can you give us an estimate? Not really. I mean, who knows what I'll run into. Could you just give us a ballpark? With these old pinsetters and all the lane work this place needs, 10 grand, minimum. 10 grand? Well, we don't have to do everything at once. Nah, we don't need smooth lanes or machines that actually reset the pins or return the fuckin' balls. Nah, don't need 'em. (CHUCKLES) Bowlers can just, like, retrieve their own balls after each roll. (LAUGHS) Motherfuckin' shit. I know it's a lot of money, but... It's not in the budget, man. Well, here's the thing. The lanes... I'm talkin' about the lanes. They left fine to me. Well, they're not fine. It's not even a question. They have to be repaired, cleaned, and reconditioned. What if it's like every lane has its own character, you know, like a different challenge. Carlos, this isn't golf. Come on, man, this is bowling, great American sport. It's available and affordable to the 99%. (SIGHS) You're right, man, I'm sorry. - I'm freakin' out. - No worries. I just want it to be great, you know. It is gonna be great. I want it to be great, too. You know what, go back to the kitchen. I'll... - Let me woo him. - All right, thanks. - All right. - Thanks, man. Hey, you're Hoffy. I saw your cute little display on the wall. Oh. Yeah. I got 300 scores before, but nobody ever put my pictures in the papers. Well, I was just a kid at the time, so. When's the last time you got a perfect score? That was the last time, that one magic Saturday. Just a lucky day, huh? Whoop-de-do. Whoop-de-do, de-do. It wasn't a lucky day, Al. I was good. When I was a teenager, I averaged over 200. Yeah, and what happened? You grew up and you got all mental, couldn't bowl for shit anymore? No, I got interested in other things, okay. I started drawing comics. I went to art school. (LAUGHS) Uh-huh. Since you're such a hotshot bowler, Al, you should enter our grand opening tournament and share your gift. You gonna put my picture on the wall after I bury your ass? You know, I'm just tryin' to make friendly conversation. Yeah, yeah, right, friendly conversation. You're tryin' to get a discount. Al, if you continue to be rude, I might have to get somebody else. I am the boss. If you're gonna be this rude, I'll walk. And then you'll have to get someone else to do what I can do. And good luck doin' that. In this county, I'm the only guy. (WINDOW SLAMS) (BOLD UPBEAT MUSIC) Still want me around, Bigshot Bobby? Yeah, I do, Al. AL: That's what I thought. (LAUGHS) CARLOS: So you wanna just reach in. And then you punch. You drizzle it in the side, and you rub the in. Yes. I'm gonna have to practice if I'm gonna beat that clown. I'll bowl with you. You will? That's great, you bowl? Uh... No. (LAUGHS) Even better. This is a fresh hop from Eugene. Okay. Mm. That's really nice. - Yeah. - No Budweiser? No way, not here. Wait 'til you taste these pies. They should pair 'em with Opus One. Well, you're gonna price out your clientele. That's why I need a big-value cab that's not obnoxious. I have a local cab that will blow your mind. And it is 120 a case. (DOOR SLAMS) Uh-oh. Bigshot Bob, this place is worse off than I thought. So I'm gonna be bringin' on my assistant Joe. Is that necessary? You want your lanes respectable for your historic grand opening tournament? Yeah, but... Okay then. You know, Al, I'd like to express a little gratitude right now for giving me the opportunity to light up your ass during this tournament. I'm gonna really enjoy destroying you. Oh, shit. Whoa. So. (SIGHS) So that's how it's gonna be? You haven't even seen me roll, Hoffy. You haven't seen the action on my ball. First-class Boomer. Nothin' but clean games on my cards. I'm gonna fry your ass. I'm gonna send you back to art school. (QUIRKY TENSE MUSIC) (AL LAUGHS) I like him. (BLADE SIGHS) (LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC) CARLOS: This is the buffalo pesto. Please, please, try it. All right. - Tanya, Blade. - Thank you, sir. CARLOS: That's the spicy Calabrese. Oh! CARLOS: Bon appetit. Mm. CARLOS: Blade, por favor, take one. Oh, my god. What did I tell you? TANYA: Yeah. It's amazing. Mm. (CELLPHONE BUZZING) - Mm. - So good. - Huh? - Oh. That's your dough. Hey, Mario, sorry, I'm eating. Okay. MARIO: All right, we got Bobby, Carlos? BOBBY: Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also Blade, our new prep cook. MARIO: Hey, Blade, welcome. Yeah. MARIO: Guys, listen, I gotta tell you. Dubai, geez, this place is beautiful. That's what money does. It simply empowers people to put absolutely beautiful things out into the world, like your pies, Carlos. Yeah, we're taste-testing them right now, as we speak. MARIO: Oh, you tease. BOBBY: So delicious. MARIO: All right, guys, a little business here. All right. Grand opening, that's fast approaching. How's everything looking? Amazing. I'm loving coming in here at the crack of dawn just gettin' busy in the kitchen. MARIO: All right, crack of dawn, wonderful. (CARLOS AND TANYA CHUCKLE) Bobby? It's goin' very good. Very good. (TANYA LAUGHS) We're coming out with organic pilsners, local. We're branching out into, like, some soft drinks for the children. MARIO: Oh, there we go. That's what I'm talkin' about. Are you comin' to the grad opening? MARIO: Oh, come on. What are you, crazy? Jenny's already booked the flights, man. And Hoffy, you're gonna bowl another 300 game my man I can feel it. I'll be jet-lagged, but I will be in time for some pies. Look, much love, guys, I gotta run. See you all soon. Take care. Bye-bye. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo. (PLAYFUL MUSIC) BOBBY: Can't stop thinkin' about my mom. She never had a real wedding or a honeymoon. Our wedding and reception was perfect. What can I say? The aliens wrote a great script. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Is it normal for a man to think about his mom on his honeymoon? Don't misunderstand. Nikki and I were having a terrific time. After the luau, I was told my mom's boyfriend called. I knew something happened, because this clown would never call me. (POIGNANT MUSIC) Four days into our honeymoon, we were on our way back home. Margie. Mother. Mom. Mama. Mommy. (HAND KNOCKING) Knock, knock. Hey. Hey, are we all buttoned up on the first order so I can take it? Yeah, just like it is. Thanks, appreciate it. What you got there? Oh, just doodling, takin' advantage of my office. Doodling? So self-indulgent. TANYA: Is that you? Yeah. Apparently my storied life deserves a book. - Can I? - Oh, yeah, yeah. You can touch it. Wow. These are amazing. These are really fucking amazing. It must be so cathartic. I submitted 'em to Curly Mullet Comics in Portland. I haven't heard back yet. It's a long shot. Well, maybe they didn't get to it yet. Did you submit anywhere else? Why not? You're in here after hours. I'm you got a lot of stuff here. Well, that doesn't mean it deserves to be published. Oh. I see. You have your wires crossed. It's just a work in progress. I don't even have an ending yet. I mean, you love doing this, so just stop complaining about it and finish it. You have no idea what I've been going through tryin' to finish this. But that's why you need to finish it. Because people need to see this. Otherwise, it's not a book. It doesn't count. I don't mean to be harsh. It just seems like you're in a funk. Is that your ex? BOBBY: Yeah. TANYA: She is so gorgeous. She's hot, she's like, and not like fake hot. She's like French cafe, sort of nostalgic. Hey, do you wanna go outside for just, out to the bar. Okay. Anyway, the plot sort of turns on Nikki and my mother. But it's really all about me, a memoir of sorts. I'm trying to be very realistic. And it is, except for the aliens that control the simulation that I live in. And I know that sounds weird. Of course it does. It's so obvious, yeah. (LAUGHS) Oh, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. So why did you get divorced. Well, we were in Oahu. I, well, we were on our second honeymoon. And my husband went off with his high school girlfriend. (LAUGHS) - Oh, my god. - Yeah. You're kidding me? No, they'd been emailing, and they just decided to go through with it. (BOBBY GASPS) So. That's brutal. It was. Yeah, it was brutal. But I'm good, you know. I have fully adjusted to being on my own. I've got no kids. I've got no attachments. And you know, I literally never have to speak his name again. What's his name? Not saying. You're very quick. (BOTH LAUGH) You're good, you're good. Well, I've never been happier. So it's all good. You're wearing it well. Hey, Al. I'm takin' off. If you don't mind, could you turn off the lights and close up? Actually, Joe and I were thinkin' of leavin' all the fuckin' lights on, Hoffy, and leavin' all the doors wide open. Is that all right? (JOE LAUGHS) (AL IMITATES PIN CRASHING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (BOBBY SIGHS) Do you need a cab? (BOBBY CHUCKLES) - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Thanks. TANYA: Yeah. I feel like I'm 14 again, drawing comics and needing a ride home. Well, it's not all bad being 14. I like the way you devoured that pizza today. Jesus Christ. (SLURPS) I don't know know how that happens. Where does it go? (LAUGHS) BOBBY: It's the silver Airstream on the right, just past this building. Okay. Wow. You were not kiddin' when you said small. I used to live in this big, old house on a 100-acre farm. And when the trim season would come, all these vagabonds would just take over the place. And there was a bungalows on the property. It was really fun for about a month. (TANYA LAUGHS) Yeah. So I took advantage of my mom's Airstream, simplified, downsized. Yeah, I don't save anything. Since I've been on my own, it's like any junk that I have that I have a negative attachment to it, send it to Goodwill, or recycle it, or I don't know, throw it in a dumpster and never look back. Feels good. You're so... Well, you're a lot of things. Thanks for the ride. (DOOR THUDS) After the funeral, mom's aneurysm had me scared. So I took a kickboxing class to get into shape. It helped vent my anger. My work improved. Even work was fun again. It was the best I'd felt in months. I was confident. And it sparked our marriage. But then the kicker, I couldn't get Nikki pregnant. It was my genes, after all. And so my bloodline would stop with me, an only child. (MACHINE BEEPING FAINTLY) It wasn't even really a discussion. It was over. She wanted her own kids and a life I couldn't give her. Nikki sold the wedding rings, and I kept our shitty Taurus. (LOW TONES WARBLING) BLADE: Okay. Should I (SPEAKS FAINTLY)? BLADE: Looks good. No, a little bit up on your side. - There we go. - Yeah, it's good. Perfect. (ENERGETIC MUSIC) (MOANS) Eso. You know what happens if we do this right, Blade? It's so important. Huh? Close your eyes. Do it, keep workin' the dough, but close your eyes. Now imagine the most wonderful crust in the world. (BLADE CHUCKLES) Yeah. We wanna develop the stands of gluten. Light and airy with just the right chew. Crisp with a beautiful char. BLADE: Yeah. - You see it? - Yeah. Okay, now put that love in the dough. Good, put it in the punch. Beautiful. Pero con amor. That's it, now own it, brother! Do it, Blade! That's it, send that beautiful ball back to daddy. That's what I'm talkin' about. Now give us a fresh 10. Good machine. All right, Joe, little somethin' goofy goin' on with pinsetter in lane three. It sounds a little fucked up. Figure her out, and then our work's done here. Yeh, sounds like the cycle solenoid's outta whack, easy fix. So like I was saying, foodies have gotten so sophisticated, there's very little margin for error. But with all the great pizzerias in the world, why shouldn't the best one in the Northwest be here in Phoenix, Oregon. Because it's on Portland. There are some great pies in Portland, but nothing like this. Try it. Write about that in your article. Al, Joe, the lanes look great. Thank you. You said it was gonna be $10,000. This is twice that. (AL LAUGHS) What the fuck, Al? We've replaced nine sections of lane. I worked on this job for 93 hours, and I stink. Joe and me restored your lanes. We repaired and oiled all 24. We fixed 11 pinsetters with new parts. Well, thanks for clarifying that. I want a goddamn cashier's check. All right, relax, Al. You'll have your check. You better, or you won't open. I got a lot of bowlers comin' in here for your little tournament, Hoffy. So don't fuck with me. (TENSE QUIRKY MUSIC) (SPEAKING DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) It's really expensive. - Well, here... - Ooh. - Is a little pick-me-up... - Wow. After that debacle. Root beer floats for the kids. All locally made, vanilla organic gelato and... Oh, my god. Caldera root beer. - Mm. - Okay, Bobby. - Delectable, brother. - Holy smokes. - These are seriously ridic. - Mm. You like? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Mm. - Wow. I have to bring this up. Now that Al doubled the price on his repairs, Mario's deposit hasn't hit the account yet, so. Really, why not? What's goin' on, Tanya? Don't worry. He has to, you know, he's just busy getting liquid for, to match this deposit he has to make on the Phoenix Farm deal. He has to do a million dollars cash. That's why he's been in Dubai and Tokyo, and. Yeah, of course. And we've got enough money to cover us. - Yeah. - So we're all right. Trust me, $50,000 is nothing to this guy. I've seen how hard he works. - Absolutely. - And plus, this is your destiny. Absolutely! (GLASSES CLINKING) TANYA: You're livin' it. BOBBY: How many bowlers do we have, Marie? We have 16 so far. We are golden. All right. Your wine, sir. Oh, perfect timing. Yeah, you sign for that. Yeah. Wow, that's really fillin' up. You guys did a good job. Couldn't have done it without Al, as much as I hate to admit it. All right. I need to deal with my other accounts. Are you all good? - Yeah. - Good. Thanks again for all your help - way above the call of duty. - Yeah. Oh, there was one thing I wanted to ask you. TANYA: You? Do you still wanna bowl with me? Is that what the kids are calling it these days? Yeah. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I would love to. I can't tonight, though, I got a conference call with Mario. But I can tomorrow. Okay. Okay. BOBBY: I'll just be staring at the clock. Well, don't be starin' at my butt. BOBBY: Too late. (TANYA LAUGHS) (GENTLE SENTIMENTAL MUSIC) First-batch pancetta, man. What do you think? Mm, it's good, man. - Yeah? - Very good. Excellent. BLADE: Mm. Hey, Carlos, should we make this Calabrese 20 bucks? CARLOS: No, I wanna keep it simple. So Tio, what if someone wants just a pepperoni? No. We've only got four choices, okay. And all the ingredients are important. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. RUDY: What if somebody wants a Calabrese, but not spicy? Look, if you don't like it hot, there's three other pies. I like it hot. It's so good, Rudy. I haven't tried it yet, man. Well, you should try it. Have it for lunch. Carlos has got it totally dialed. Thank you. So people are paying 18 bucks for a small pizza? (SCOFFS) Rudy, 12 inches is the perfect size, man. Bigger or smaller compromises the crust. It's not small. It's perfect for two. I just think some people might want a large. That's all I'm saying. (SCOFFS) You're not listening to me. There's only one size, okay. If they want more, they can order more. Tio, don't take it wrong. I just know that families around here are lookin' for a deal, that's all. You know what, they don't have to go all the way to New York for a great pie. That's the deal. If you wanna save money, then go get a coupon from a pinche pizza chain. Get a cheap, extra large, extra doughy, tasteless pizza crust topped with bland sauce and processed ingredients, loaded with partially hydrogenated oils, and maybe even MSG. It makes me sick just thinking about it. (NOTEPAD THUDS) (FOOTSTEPS SHUFFLING) (DOOR SLAMS) Look at it this way, Rudy. We're saving 'em on airfare. That's a $600 savings right there. (SIGHS) So Nephew, I'm so sorry for what happened earlier. - Nah. - You know, I'm just... You were right, it was my bad. But I just... It's just that I, you know, this menu's really particular to me. (CARLOS SPEAKS FAINTLY) Sorry. I know, Tio. - Woo! - That's it, Hoffman! My Hoffy, baby! Listen up, guys. Mario's big-time check has been deposited. The Phoenix Farms deal is closed and fully funded. And that means you are funded. Oh! That's right. Thank you, Tanya. Yeah. Boyyy! Oh, nice. (LAUGHS) - Roll a strike. - Okay. And the aliens come through. Woo! (UPBEAT ENERGETIC MUSIC) (TANYA CHEERS) BOBBY: Yeah. I was into golf. It's your sport. CARLOS: Don't play with me. (ONLOOKERS CHEERING) Yeah, I think that's on fire. RUDY: Yes, it was. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Woo-hoo ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Yes. ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Woo-hoo ♪ Oh, yeah. I see a lot of potential. (GENTLE MUSIC) You want the tour now? (TANYA LAUGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (TANYA GROANS) Hey. You want some coffee? Multiple cups. (TANYA CHUCKLES) Right? Will do. No, that's what I was saying. Yeah, they do. But it seems like everything's coming together, really. I know. Yeah, me, too. (GENTLE MUSIC) (SPEECH DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) Hey, thanks for last night. (CHUCKLES) Your trailer is actually not that bad. Built for one, but I get it. Well, in my mind anyway, my Airstream's always been kind of a stop gap. But probably time for some new digs. You think? (UPBEAT MUSIC) Guys, Mario's comin'. Gets to Salt Lake this afternoon, and he hits Portland tonight. So it will be late, but he will be here. - Oh. - Yeah. CARLOS: That's great news. Make sure and save - a Calabrese for Mario. - Rudy, (SPEAKS FAINTLY). Four or five cars just pulled up. Really? Yeah. That's great. Come on, all right, everyone. Man your stations. CARLOS: Right, let's go, everybody. Woo! Game time. (PATRONS CHATTERING) Welcome to Rising Phoenix. What are you drinkin'? (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey, Carlos, we got come customers. All right. (ASSERTIVE MUSIC) I would suggest the Elisa. It's an original creation of mine. But all of the pies are delicious. MARIE: Welcome. What can I get for you? - Hi. - Can I get a size sevens? It's perfect. Yes. I can help you. There you are. CARLOS: Lookin' good, lookin' good. Six more orders, Tio. All right, let's keep it movin', everybody. TANYA: I got it. BOBBY: Thank you. All right, what can I get you? There's a line. BOBBY: Root beer float. Thank you. You got my check? This ain't a cashier's check. It's a check, Al. It's good, just go cash it. Can't you see I'm slammed? (SIGHS) You know somethin', Hoffy, you're goin' down today. You're goin' way down to the ground where the hedgehogs frown. God, I love bowling. (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) You had me goin' there, Al. Thanks for opening up this place. Well, thanks for all your work. Hey, can I buy you and Joe a drink? We'll have two ice-cold Budweisers, no more, no less. I don't have Budweiser. But I got great organic pilsner from Bend. Yeah, we'll have two waters. No ice. Two waters, no ice. Excuse me, I got a tournament game to play here. It's lane 23. Are you Guadalupe? Como estas? (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING) You got this, don't let him get in your head. (CROWD CHEERING) RUDY: Two Elisas, enjoy. Boom, boom, piping hot. Here you go, buffalo pesto. And then another Calabrese. Enjoy, everybody. Good. Can I get some goddamn service around here? Ah. (LAUGHS) You hungry, we're a little busy. You want a pie? Sure, I'll take a large pepperoni, extra cheese. We don't do that here, bro. You telling me you don't have cheese and fuckin' pepperoni back there? Our Napoletano pizzas are made for scratch, 12 inches in diameter, four different styles, no substitutions. (MUMBLES) No substitutions. Don't do this, man. Do you want a pie or not? Yeah, I'll take a calabrese. Okay. - Blade! - Yes, sir? Can I get a calabrese for my bro here, extra spicy. BLADE: Calabrese, extra spicy, comin' right up. PATRON: Can I get five more margaritas? (SPEAKS IN SPANISH) Take these out. Bam. Flow, flow, flow, flow, flow. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CROWD GROANS) Hey, Tanya. Mm-hmm? Can you cover the bar for me when I bowl my game? Sure. I'm fine, I'm here. I scheduled my game for after the lunch rush. I guess I just wanted to see how busy we were. It's fine. I'm just gonna be here all weekend anyway, 'cause Mario asked me to, so. Oh, yeah? Why did he ask you to do that? Just to keep an eye on things, send him updates. Huh. Well, Carlos and I can do that. Yeah, but he knows I've worked in a million restaurants. So have I. Yes, but he wants an unbiased opinion. On what, on me? Don't be so sensitive. Mario put his money in, too. He has a right to ask questions. I'm his proxy. Why do you think I've been hanging out and helping for long? I don't know, 'cause I thought you liked me, or you were enjoying yourself. I am. But this is just part of the job. Okay. Look, man, this is like a super-stressful weekend. Maybe last night wasn't the best timing. But I mean, I can handle it. Yeah, well, you're the pro. (TANYA SCOFFS) Sorry, I didn't, that's not what I meant. I can handle it. I'm sorry. There's that 14-year-old boy again. Not always so cute, is he? CUSTOMER: Hi. - Hello. - Can I get a pint of pilsner, please? Yes, you may. (PATRONS CHATTERING) Hey, Bobby, Carlos needs you. BOBBY: What's up? I'm outta dough, man. Well, just make some more. It's a complicated process, bro. It takes hours and hours. No. How many pizzas did you sell? 40,000 grams of flour. What is that? - What is that? - It's over 100 pies. That's incredible. Yeah. All right. Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody, hey. Great day so far. But we've run our of dough. (CROWD JEERING) Yeah, I'm sorry. I know, I know. But part of the reason is, my partner Carlos comes in here every day, crack of dawn, makes this delicious dough with his hands. That's why it's so good. And we're probably gonna run out of dough at some other time in the future. So you're gonna need to reserve your pies in advance. Silver lining is that Rudy's Taqueria is showing up with their taco truck. They'll be here soon. Go get some of that delicious grub. Come back in and keep bowling. Thanks. (CROWD GRUMBLING) Thanks, bro. BOBBY: Sure. Nice goin'. We good, Uncle? Yeah, gracias, Sobrino. You saved the day. No te procupes. Damn, I don't even have enough dough left to make Mario his Calabrese. You're gonna have to freeze the dough. That way you never run out. I have a 100-year mother yeast starter in my kitchen, Rudy. Okay, you can't freeze the dough, mi hijo, that's crazy. How many times do I have to explain that to you. Okay, but now you're gonna have to hire a bigger kitchen staff. You can't teach this in a day. It takes months, ask Blade. Well, then I don't know what to say, Tio. You're leavin' a lot of money on the table. After everything I've done for you, Bobby, five years my employee... You've done nothing for me. Hey, hey, hey, let's be cool, guys. Let's make peace, man. It's not worth the karma. I taught you everything about this business. I find your confrontational approach shocking. Be cool, Kyle, come on. Carlos, you've really outdone yourself with this. You know, I might put this on my menu. 100% legal. CARLOS: I'd like to see you try. Bobby, he's already paid and registered. What are you doing, that's against the rules. I've already paid. I make the rules here. Oh, I see. - Oh. - You want a piece of me? Bring it on, Superman. Ooh. Bring it on. Vendetta bowl. Grudge match, grudge match, grudge match. Okay. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Close your eyes. Close your eyes. What I like to do in the kitchen is I visualize, right. I see the heat. I see the melting cheese. I see the char on the crust, the meat so tender. What are you talking about? Sorry. Visualize the lanes, just you and the shiny hardwood. Imagine the pins. Now watch them all fall. Falling pins falling down. (IMITATES PINS CRASHING) Falling pins falling down. (IMITATES PINS CRASHING) (DETERMINED MUSIC) That's what I'm talkin' about. Great visualization. Woo! Don't make me do the touchdown dance. Don't, don't do that. CARLOS: Come on. Woo! Yeah! Bobby! Oh, man. The lanes are too slick, can't keep it in the pocket. God. That's 'cause you suck, man. The lanes are fine. Who is this? A much better bowler than you, jackass. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, guys, there's kids present. You wanna see a real hook stretch? Stick around for my next round. Let's go, Joe. I can't play under these conditions. Well, I knew you were a stealer. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that you're a cheater. Kyle, you are a one-percenter that used to steal money out of my tip jar. Why don't you get outta here. One-percenter? Bobby, I'm broke. And I'm not goin' anywhere. I'll stick around and watch you lose. Come on. (MUMBLES) Go in. (MACHINE WHIRRING) Come on. Put it in, put it in! (GROANS) Come on. Go in, go in. Go in, go in. (GRUNTS) Hey. TANYA: Hey. I have to bowl again. TANYA: No, ask Blade or Carlos or... They don't know their way around a bar like you do. Well, find someone who does. What about Rudy? Just one more hour. What if you keep winning? People think I work here now. I need to not be doing this. Well, I don't wanna damage your reputation, Oh, you are incredible. I've been helping you for months. You've been helpin' Mario. Mario's not here. Well, he'll be here later. You can give him your report the. Actually, no, his flight was delayed, and he's not gonna be here 'til tomorrow now. Is that why you're so upset? That has nothing to do with it. Tell me the truth. Last night, was that like, just taking one for the team for you? Wait, what? Your recon mission to the trailer. Was that just due diligence for Mario? You are a paranoid little child. And this is the last drink I'm pouring. I can bartend, Bobby. No problem. Seriously, no worries, man.

BOTH: Bobby Hoffman. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Bobby! Hey, thanks. Why don't you hold it, thanks. You guys are awesome, thanks. I should first thank our partner, who is not here today, Mario, 'cause he predicted this. How he knew that, I don't know. And of course, Tanya, who, (PATRONS CLAPPING) well, I just wanna say thank you for all the time that you've put on. Sorry. I just can't even believe we've pulled this off. Also, of course, Rudy and Marie and Guadalupe, and Blade and Liz, and everybody else that's helped. Of course, Al and Joe, couldn't have pulled this off without you. I just wanna say one special thing to Carlos. Finally, you have the kitchen to do what you love and do best. I love you, man. (CROWD CHEERING) Thanks, thanks. Congratulations. So I just sign the back of it, right? (PULSING UPBEAT MUSIC) BLADE: Hey, you want one more? Thank you, Blade. That one is definitely on the house. Think I earned it? Yeah, you sure did. That was, like, crazy. You're a local hero. That was incredible. I don't know. But I would like to apologize for making such a ridiculous fool of myself. I don't get what I want, and then I just say the stupidest things. I'm sorry. Dude. It was a solid opening night, and we had a good time, right? So let's just leave it at that. That's it then? Yeah. You need to take care of yourself, Bobby. This heaviness that you're carrying around, it's really not working for you. I mean, these could be the best years of your life. Do you realize that? You need to finish that book. And then you need to stop drawing pictures of your ex. Because it's very sweet, but it's really a turnoff. I really let you down, didn't I? Me, no. You disappointed you. I am fine. I can take care of myself. I am a grown woman. You need to celebrate. You deserve this, you earned it, too. Come on. Hey, Tanya, join us. See. (CARLOS SPEAKS FAINTLY) Mornin', fellas. BOBBY: Morning, sir. Bigshot, day two. Beautiful day. (PINBALL MUSIC) (MACHINE PLINKING) Fuck. Okay. Hey, Bobby, it's Al. His check didn't clear. Fuck. What happened? None of his numbers are working. You haven't gotten ahold of him yet? No. What about Jenny? I just tried calling her, and her number is out of service, too. Are you fucking kidding me? He was also a signer. There's over 90 grand in there. He's emptied our accounts?! We don't know that yet. Maybe he moved the money to an account with a higher interest rate. Maybe he just decided to close his office. Wake up! Tanya, there's gotta be someone around here that knows him, right, someone? What about the weed guys, the Phoenix Farm guys? Yeah, what about them? Their accounts have also been emptied, $2 million. I was one of 12 investors. Come on, he's famous, Tanya. I mean, there's gotta be some other kind of contact info. He's a fraud. Mario Bentley Jr., even his name's a joke. How could I have been so stupid? Not your fault. (TANYA GROANS) BOBBY: We filed fraud charges. As far as the law was concerned, this guy didn't exist. Mario knew what he was doing. We tried to keep the place open, but with no cash, we were operating month to month. And all the bowling crowd wanted was cheap, greasy food and Budweiser. Our old equipment was breaking down, and we couldn't afford Al. And besides, Al was suing us. The landlord seized the property, and Al took it over. You know when you think you're finally going for it, doing something important, and the next thing you know, you don't know what hit you, and you're right back where you started? Are you any wiser now? You rewind your life to analyze what went wrong along the way. Your ex-wife, (POIGNANT MUSIC) (TONES TINKLING) does she ever think of you? No. (BOBBY SIGHS) (MUSIC SWELLS) So yeah, this is part of our summer Hawaiian luau theme. It's part of a national promotion celebrating our first Bingos on Hawaii, the big island. Here, I saved a blue one for you, bigshot. Make sure you get a good fit. So we'll be having all kinds of things on our menu. Poke, it is pronounced poke, not poke or poke. We also will be having huli-huli chicken, pork bun sliders. Good. Great to have an older person on staff, Bobby. And also, Bingos pineapple boat pizza. This is a boat pizza, not just a regular pizza. And that's because they're going to come in a boat shape with a little sail. (FAN RATTLING) (BOBBY GROANS) (BOBBY SIGHS) (CLOCK TICKING) (METAL MUSIC IN HEADPHONES) (MESSAGE WHOOSHES) (BOBBY SIGHS) So how come you never text me back? I'm here now. I'm sorry, Bobby. It wasn't my fault. They ever gonna catch that guy? (SCOFFS) He just vanished, man. What a piece of work that guy was. I sure would like my money back. CARLOS: So how's Bingos? It's a shitty, homogenized disaster of a restaurant owned by a huge, impersonal conglomerate. The food's awful, and I get to wear a lei. (CARLOS LAUGHS) Well, I've got some good news, so just hear me out. Rudy, Marie, and my father are bankrolling my new restaurant. You want a better job? (CELLPHONE BUZZING) I don't know. Well, you don't have to answer now. We open next month. Just drop by and see us. 430 Main, are you kidding? No, Kyle went out of business, man. They evicted him. Rudy knows the landlord. Fuckin' Kyle. Well, I guess there is some justice in the world. So you're openin' this restaurant instead of payin' me back? Bobby, I didn't steal your money, bro. You need to get over it, dude. Easy for you to say. I lost all my cash, too. Tanya and her cousins lost $200,000, and they got over it. Even Al laughs about it now. God, if it's not my fault, then it's Tanya's. If it's not Tanya's fault, then it's the aliens. You know, Tanya was right. You really are like 14, man. Your aliens, you ever thought that maybe they're tryin' to help you? You ever think about that? (DOOR JINGLING) (VOICEMAIL BEEPING) DAVID: Hey, Bobby, David Brinker, Curly Mullet Comics. Sorry it took me so long to get back to you. But I really dig the writing sample you sent. I think there's some potential here. Anyway, I'd love to see the whole "Phoenix, Oregon" book if you have it. Thanks, man. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. (GENTLE MUSIC) They actually coincide, so like, then there's times we could do a little something for them. Hi, Bobby. I quit. What? You're a great boss, Stacy, truly. But I can't work here anymore. What are you, wait a, wait, you're leaving now? You're quitting now? You're not even... (DOOR RATTLES) (BUOYANT MUSIC) TANYA: People need to see this, otherwise it's not a book. It doesn't count. CARLOS: Well, you know what should really freak you out? Getting old, not going after your dreams when you had a chance. Oh, that's it, bro, you could roll. I remember. BOBBY: It's a completely useless talent. Maybe I should learn how to salsa dance. TANYA: Maybe you should. (LAUGHS) CARLOS: This place, it's my destiny, Bobby. I know it is. TANYA: You need to take care of yourself, Bobby. I mean, these could be the best years of your life. Do you realize that? (LIGHTHEARTED PIANO MUSIC) Hoffman, what's goin' on? Hey. Bobby. Wow. MARIE: Finally made it in. The place feels so different. We open in two weeks. Is Carlos around? Let me go get him. Can I get you a little somethin', somethin'? Oh, just water. Come on. Go for it. All right, thanks, Rudy. I hope whatever you're drinking goes well with an Elisa or a Calabrese. You're not makin' pies right now, are ya? Oh, yeah, in our new wood-fired oven as we speak. Hold on a sec. Tanya. It's so good to see you. What you got for me? You can't beat Quady North Syrah. They sell their premiere by the bottle but their standard by the glass. And it's as good as any mid-range from Napa or Santa Barbara. I love your palate. Right? Oh, my god, delicious. Hey, Bobby. Come try this, bro. Ooh. Mm, I think my pies gonna taste so much better in this place. TANYA: Yeah. Full respect, you were built for this business. Bien gracias. Hey, why don't you stay for dinner? It's just familia. Marie, Rudy, can you help me put these tables together? What's up? Why you lookin' at me like that? I didn't expect to run into you. Carlos, I have a few other stops to make today, so. Well, why don't you stay at least for a slice. I mean, see how my pies translate in this new wood-fire oven. I'm gonna take a rain check on that, but keep the bottles. - Let me know what you think. - Okay. You got it. All right, have a good one. What'd you say to her? You're really gonna hold these grudges the rest of your life? You still want me to work here? With equity to make up for what happened. BOBBY: You don't have to do that. I want to. You're my bro. Thanks, man. Hey! Wait. Sorry. That's not what I meant to say. Well, that is what you said. And I haven't seen you in a long time. It was weird. Yeah, I just got surprised, and it came out wrong. So I don't blame you, or Carlos, or aliens. I don't even blame myself anymore, mostly because that bowling alley was the best thing to happen to me in a long time, working with everybody and getting to know you, so. Do you want to come back and see how that crust translates? It's okay, you don't, maybe another time. No worries. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Sit down, sit down primos. There's more slices coming. (CROWD CHATTERING) Wow, Blade. Rudy, you got 'em? Really good, good. Right on time, I knew you guys - couldn't resist. - Hello, I'm just staying for a quick slice. Oh, come on, come on, right here. I really do have a lot of meetings today. Oh, you're gonna enjoy this. I know I'm gonna love it. Papa... papa! All right.
