(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (SIREN WAILING) (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Hello? Oh, hello. Yeah, okay. Fine. Okay. I'll be as quick as I can. Okay. (SIRENS WAILING) (MUFFLED RUMBLING) (FAINTLY) Are you all right? (INDISTINCT) (MUFFLED) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON AMBULANCE RADIO) -(SOBBING) -Up. Hi. Penny? Hi. DC Sarah McGowan. We don't know what happened yet, we just know he fell. We're just interviewing witnesses for now. -Okay. -If you'd like to follow me. Um... This is DI Cox. This is Penny, the interpreter. Hello. Thanks for coming. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I came as soon as I could. COX: That's fine. Can we start now? I'm sorry. If I can have your full name, please? Dean... Whittingham. Thank you. And place of birth? I'm sorry, don't look at me when you're speaking. Mr Whittingham needs to see your lips. Um, place of birth? -(CLICKING TONGUE) -Doncaster. COX: Doncaster. Thank you. -So there wasn't any trouble? -No, nothing like that. It was a good night. Well, till, obviously... How do you and Chris get on? CONNOR: Very good. He's a mate. -How about Dean? -Yeah, also good. Also a mate. But you didn't see him fall? PENNY: No. So you just reckoned that he fell? Yes. I thought Chris went outside for some fresh air. I thought he seemed a bit drunk. CONNOR: It wasn't that bad. It was just like a party, a carry-out, you know? Had he taken any drugs? Well, a bit of spliff, maybe. But they're really good with head injuries, right? McGOWAN: So you reckon he just fell off the balcony by accident. I guess so. Shit! Tragic, man. It's crazy! And nothing happened that might've affected him? Nothing happened during the evening? PENNY: No. You and Chris, you were mates, yeah? -Yes, that's right. -Okay, thank you. That's all I need for now. Sorry to drag you out so late. (INAUDIBLE) McGOWAN: So Dean moved in to the flat when? Three weeks ago... A month. Uh, three weeks. What, three weeks? Yeah, three weeks. And you'd never met him before that? No. He's a mate of Jak's. She knew him from uni. They go way back. (DOORBELL BUZZES) CHRIS: Ahem! Hi. Do you fancy a glass of wine? Glass of wine? Yeah? Come on, then. Cheers. So where... Where were you before this? -Edmonton. -Ed... Ugh! Grim. (CHUCKLES) There wasn't anybody he could talk to in the other house, because they were all hearing. Ah, yes. Sorry to hear that. That sounds... That sounds shit, mate. Sorry... Yeah, it was a bit. But... -It was crap anyway. -Oh. (EXHALES) Um, how long have you lived here? Um, two years. Yeah. Before I met Jak. Yeah... Yeah. -Is this your place? -Yeah. Well... Well, you know, it's the bank's. (INDISTINCT) Oh, there's Connor. Connor. Connor. You haven't told him about it? I forgot. Um... In the other room is the other lodger. Nice bloke. Good bloke. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) Hi, it's Jamie. Yeah, I know. Okay. It's not your fault. I'm sorry. I'm crap at letting people in, that's all. Well, not totally. No, actually, Jamie, you are. Yes, I do need you, Pen. You're pretty bad at this, too, you know. Why is it okay for you to push me away but not the other way round? It's so bloody one-sided! Know what? You are so shit-scared of letting anyone close, Pen. It makes it bloody difficult, okay? Like anyone else, I've got defences which sometimes... -(MACHINE CLICKS) -A fortress, mate. Get it right. -(MONITORS BLEEPING) -(BREATH HISSES) You wouldn't go back to the flat then? No, I couldn't. I couldn't. But you can't stay here with him, love, not all the time. You have to get some sleep. Um, I've rung my mum. I can stay there. How about you? I don't know, love. (VOICE BREAKING) I don't know anything at the minute. It doesn't look good, though, love, does it?

(MUFFLED) What you lookin' at? (MUFFLED) (BOYS SHOUTING) -Jak... -What? Don't fuckin'... Don't fuckin'... Get off me! CHRIS: Fuck off! Are you getting fuckin'... (VOICES MUTED) JAK: You can't do this any more! What? Oh, don't worry about her, mate. It's the old time of the month. You know what I mean? Women's troubles. She's a bit... Whoo-whoo! (LAUGHS) Let's get your shopping in. (DOOR OPENS) That's him. (POLICE RADIO SQUAWKS) OFFICER: Dean Whittingham? Do you want to get your coat? Penny. I'm only telling you this so there's no nasty surprises. Chris Groves died last night. We're now treating this as a potential murder inquiry. Now, don't take this the wrong way. I know you did your job, no problems, but... Yes, I understand. You're okay with this? Yes. But shit! Look, if you want me to get somebody more experienced, it's not a problem. I'm not gonna think any less... No... How do you know it wasn't an accident? -Or a suicide? -I can't tell you that. It's... We brief you, but if I tell you any more, I'm gonna risk compromising your impartiality. Have you got a suspect? -I can't tell you that. -But it's someone deaf? I can't tell you that, either. All I'm saying is, it's a different level of questioning. All I need to know is if you're okay with that. Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. Okay? Present, DI Cox, DC McGowan, Dean Whittingham and interpreter. You're saying there's nothing between you and Jak. -That's right. Nothing. -Nothing at all? That's what I said. Never? Not even at university? -No. -COX: Nothing at all. No. So, you're still telling me you didn't see anything. That's it. And you're still saying there were no difficulties between you and Chris. No. We were mates, like I said. So you've got no idea who pushed him over the balcony? No idea. -Not you? -No way! So... It was, uh... It was a good party? Everybody happy? A right knees-up? Well, okay. To be fair and all, it was a crap party. So you lied to us. Look, (SIGHS) it was a bad atmosphere, you know. Why did you lie to me before? Someone pushed Chris over a balcony. Tell me why it wasn't you. (SIGHS) Look, I didn't want to tell you this before, but there was a fight. Well, maybe not a fight, but aggro. Ahem! But you knew that the relationship between Jak and Chris was, um, troubled. Before, I didn't know. -So... -Now... Now, yes. So you found out? PENNY: Those two had problems. It was obvious. It wasn't a secret. So you didn't move in hoping for anything to happen, then? No. Why did you move in to the flat? Why? Because I needed a place to live. But why that flat? Why then? Why? Because Jak was offering. Why was Jak offering? Why did she ask you and nobody else? Why? -She was a mate. -COX: And nothing else? -No. -No sexual aspect? No. -So you were fighting. -No way! But you saw the fight. It was nothing. It was a bit of a scuffle with a couple of pissed guys. Bit of spliff going round, you know. So who was fighting? Chris and Dean. Well, Dean and Chris. Because? Got no idea. Sorry. And you never saw what happened on the balcony? What's to think about, Dean? You were in the same room. Were you in the same room? Yeah. So, you were in the same room, but you weren't on the balcony. Are you sure about that? -PENNY: I'm sure. -Yeah, so you were in the same room but you didn't see what happened on the balcony? -PENNY: I saw nothing. -Yes, you see, that's amazing! I mean, how can that be possible? Hmm? You are deaf and not blind, aren't you? Interview suspended, 3:41. Thank you. (RADIO SQUAWKING) Penny! Don't dash off, we need you again. Oh. Okay. She's profoundly deaf, but she can lip-read and speak. She says she doesn't need an interpreter. Her solicitor says may as well, just to be on the safe side. I don't know. I was out of it. When he fell? I was throwing up. Sorry. Look, all I want to do is understand what happened. So just try to relax, calm down and tell me what you know. Nothing. I don't know anything. I didn't see anything. Like I say, I was being sick! I came back in and he'd been on the balcony and... He wasn't there. So I looked down... (SOBBING) I'm sorry. You okay to carry on? Yeah. I'm sorry. Sure? Yes. So, how about the fight? Sorry? The fight between Dean and Chris. I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about. Wasn't there a fight between Dean and Chris? I don't know. I didn't see anything. I don't think so. GIRL: I'm sorry. Wait for me!

He's attractive, isn't he? -Dave Cox? -No! He's got four kids, anyway. Dean. The suspect. I never thought I could fancy a deaf man. Oh, sorry. That sounded awful. I didn't mean it like that. Do you often fancy suspects? Only when I'm bloody desperate. -Now, about this fight. -JAK: I told you before. I don't know anything about a fight. All right. Let's come at this another way. I believe that, during the party, Chris caught you with another man. Is that true? I'm asking you nothing that I haven't already been told. And then there was a fight. And then there was a fight. Look, I know what he's saying! I'm not stupid! Jak, I know there was a fight. I've got statements. So I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. No. Not a fight. Not exactly. Um... An unpleasantness. An exchange of blows, yeah? Yeah. Because Chris caught you with another man. It's not what you think, because... -Chris overreacted. He got it all wrong. -All... All... All I'm interested in is the facts. Chris caught you with another man and there was a fight. Yes or no? Yes. And was the other man Dean Whittingham? Come on, Jak. It wasn't exactly done in private. Was the man Chris caught you with Dean Whittingham? Um... Yes. And the fight... Sorry, the unpleasantness, was between Chris Groves and Dean Whittingham? -Yes. -COX: Thank you. But... But Dean didn't kill Chris. He... He didn't kill him. He wouldn't hurt anyone. But you were being sick at the time. -Yes. -So, as you've already told me, you don't know what happened. -No. But it... -Thank you. That's all I need for now. (LAUGHING) Jak, do you want a drink? -No, I'm fine, thanks. -No? Do you want two? Go on, have six, you greedy cow! (LAUGHS) There we are. Beers. Yeah? Yeah. MAN: I'll have one of them. CHRIS: Go on, have some. -So what... What are you saying? -We're talking about a friend. Yeah? Right. Bollocks! What are you really saying? Eh? Eh? -We're talking about a friend. -Yeah? Who? Who? -Hmm? -You don't know her. Oh, I don't know her! Oh, really? I don't know her. Right. What is all this? I tell you, what is all this semaphore? Yeah? Eh? You never told me you're gonna be talking in semaphore all the bleedin' time! (LAUGHS) Come in, number three. You are free to land on runway number three! You are free to land on runway number three! (DOOR OPENS) I reckon you know you were seen on the balcony with Chris after the fight. -PENNY: Who saw me? -You know who. -No. -You know who saw you. PENNY: No. COX: No? You reckon you can trust them? I don't know what you mean. So you reckon you can trust them? You reckon they're not gonna tell me what they saw? You reckon they think more of you than they thought of Chris? Who is this person? Come on, tell me. (CLEARS THROAT) You tell me. (INAUDIBLE) (BREATHES HEAVILY) Do you mean that Jak said she saw me? I'm not saying anything. But if that's what you're saying... I want a solicitor now. (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGS) MAN: Can you take a seat? Sorry, uh, look, I need some fresh air.

You've been messing with my stuff. You've been messing with my woman, haven't you, eh? Eh? Well, now you keep your fuckin' hands and your two-inch fuckin' cock off her! Yeah? You got that? Otherwise, you're a dead man, yeah? (DOOR SLAMS) What's up? (INDISTINCT) Please don't go! (SOBBING) (INDISTINCT) How long have you been held here? Ten hours. And the police haven't charged you with any offence? -No. -That's ridiculous! I'm going to talk to DI Cox. They've got no evidence to hold you. He's taking the piss. (DOOR OPENS) Penny? We won't need you again today, after all. Sorry to have kept you hanging around. Don't worry, it's not a problem. -Are you okay? -Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Well, you don't look it. I've got a headache.

You haven't! -He's so unhappy, Pen. He doesn't know what he did wrong. Just talk to him. That's all he wants. Honestly, I think it is. He's just trying to understand what happened. You're gonna tell me he's a really nice bloke. Well, he is. And I've got a problem running out on people. Only if you say so. Oh, Anna! Bloody hell! -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -I'm really sorry for pissing you around. I hope you get someone you deserve, next time. You never really opened up, Pen. Yeah. Maybe. No, I don't know. Yeah. Well... I'm crap. I don't have a social responsibility to be lovable, you know. -But you're unhappy. -No. Oh, come on! I'm unhappy according to your idea of happy. I'm fine according to mine. Anyway, what is all this about "opening up"? Why am I supposed to show everybody else my angst? It's quite comfortable where it is, thanks. Sorry, but why am I everybody else's bloody problem? (SILENCE) Look, fuck this! Anna, I'm sorry. Thanks for the meal. It was lovely. (PHONE BEEPS) CONNOR: Dean! Dean! You've got visitors. We're now regarding Dean Whittingham as the prime suspect in Chris Groves' murder. What this means, is that the questioning is going to get considerably tougher from now on. Sorry, why do you think Dean killed him? Well, we've got preliminary forensics reports which show that Groves's injuries are consistent with being pushed over the balcony after a struggle. We've also got several witness statements to the fight between Dean Whittingham and Chris Groves. Also, and I didn't want to tell you this before because I didn't want to risk prejudicing you, but Dean Whittingham has previous convictions for violent offences. And I mean several of them, going back to his teens. He was in a YOI. A YOI? McGOWAN: Young offenders' institution. COX: Listen, I know this has been a bit of a baptism of fire, but if it's any consolation, I think you're doing a great job. Oh, there's one other thing. From now on, we're gonna be videotaping all Whittingham's interviews. It's just on advice from CPS, absolutely no reflection on yourself. Just to make sure there's no question of ambiguity. -Makes sense when you think about it. -Yes. Are you okay, Penny? Sorry, yes, I'm fine. Okay. Are we ready, then? Okay? (HEARTBEATS THUNDER) No, I'm sorry, I... I'm feeling really ill. You'll have to get another interpreter. (GASPS) (SOBS) Here you go, mate. Oi! Mate! Here you go. Here you go. Some food for you. What? (ENUNCIATING) Some food for you. Do I look fucking stupid? Fuck off! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck off! (SHOUTING AND BANGING ON WALL) COX: (MUFFLED) We can't bail him to go back to the same address. (INDISTINCT) Pen? Pen, what's wrong? (SNIFFS) Oh, God! Nothing. -It doesn't matter. -No, obviously not! Okay. I'm sorry. Well, you did ask! Um... I... What am I meant to say? I fell for, as in I shagged a couple of times, a man I met when I was signing for him at the police station. Now he's facing a murder charge. I thought he might be, but I decided not to believe it. I don't know what I feel. I mean, obviously, it was a bloody idiotic thing to do. (EXHALES) I don't know. I... He was... Anna, he was brilliant. And he's a murderer. Murderer. He kept asking me if I believed him. And he was trying to get me to tell him what this girl had said. I wouldn't... I wouldn't do that. I did think I believed him actually. They wouldn't charge him for no reason, would they? (SIGHS) I just thought he was a really good man. Just felt good.
