(siren wailing) (brakes screeching) - [Scuggs] I've got you covered, you little twerp. Now come out with your hands on top of your head. I got him, sheriff. I think he's hiding in the trunk. - What the? - All right, once more. Now, pay attention. This is a homecoming rehearsal. It is not a gang war. Just imagine. A hush goes over the stadium. I mean, this is as important as the game itself. Now, a-one, a-two, a-three. - [All Students] Homecoming. - Of which I am the queen. - [Girl] Homecoming. - [All Students] Time for autumn leaves to clog the eaves and cold that freezes snotty sleeves. - We believe these and other truisms, right to the bottoms of our boo-ism. - Whacha been up to, Roscoe? - Want to be an accessory to the fact? - The principal will present this year's queen. Miss Peggy Sue Turner. - Uh, whose tangerine Triumph convertible is that out there in the parkin' lot? - It's mine, sheriff. It's gonna be in the homecoming parade. - Your ass is gonna be in the homecoming! - Don't mind me. You know, what the hell? (sheriff shouting) - Hey, Peggy Sue. What time do you wanna get picked up tonight? - Picked up? What time do you wanna get put down? Mess with my daughter and all you'll pick up is your teeth. - I get to keep her all night after the game too. - There's no back seat. - Oh, there are ways. At least six. - 32. - You've been reading my mail. - Harold, pull over and let me drive, okay? I wanna check it out. - Forget it! I'm the only one insured to drive it. - Sure. - And for one endless stretch of maybe 40 seconds, I'll be sittin' right here, and Peggy Sue Turner'll be sittin' right here. And while she's blowin' kisses to the crowd, guess where my eyeballs' gonna be pasted. - If I have to leave you a note, I'll remember to write backwards. - The only reason my dad lets me go out with the quarterback is 'cause I told him he never scores. Oh, I gotta go. Bye. - [Boys] Peggy Sue. - Hi, guys. - Can we drive you to the stadium? - You know what it's like. - I'll ask him anyway. I'm not afraid. (clears throat) Morning, sir. Just came by for Peggy Sue. - Get. - At least give us something for the homecoming scrapbook. Everybody else has given us some kind of memento. - I said get. - Here, put these beside my name. - I said get! - [Boy] Ah! Close shave. Let's go. - Hey, Bentley, time to play Let's Make a Deal. Get 'em while they're still hot. Hey, Bentley, you got it? - Now, listen, I could get in trouble for this. Everybody knows that this isn't a catalog item. - You got six. Nobody'll ever miss one. All right, gimme it. I'll throw in the mag wheels for both Furies. - All right, but don't use it in town. - Promise. Got enough now to keep the police in shape for another year for sure. - Some fleet. - A criminal like yourself, Lester, will probably snicker at it, but I'd say our parts department here saves Cyco County three or four thousand tax dollars a year. (phone ringing) - That's probably for me. (laughs) - Boy, you gonna laugh out of the other side of your head when Habib calls me and offers me a million clams for my formula. I left this number. - Habib who? - Abu Habib Bibubu, that's who. He sells oil. - What would he wanna buy your moonshine for? - So he can suppress it, dummy. - You mean you'd sell out, and your superfuel would just disappear? - Time-honored American business practice. (siren wailing) - Surprise, Bentley. It works great, you dumb hick. - You promised! (ominous music) What a clean shirt, sheriff. - What was that siren? - I don't know, sheriff. I thought it was you. - I don't think so, Bentley. Could it have been you? - Uh, right again, sheriff. (imitates siren sound) - [Girl] One, two, three, four. (march music) - I want every starter to hit the john at least twice between now and game time. Stay loose, stay loose. How's the knee? - Oh, it'll be all right, coach. Coach? I want to know, can I get excused from halftime chalk talk? I mean, with Peggy Sue gettin' crowned and all. I just didn't wanna miss that. - There is no room in this game for sentiment, son. For 48 minutes, you're married to that pigskin. - I know that, coach, but halftime ain't part of the 48 minutes. - You're all gonna be on the field durin' the ceremony. All right. Keep your mind on the game! - Like this, coach? - You got it! (marching music) - Roscoe, have you got it? - Sure thing, Mrs. Kane. Just roll it out and turn the valve. - You're so clever. Harold is so lucky to have such a clever friend. - And such a beautiful mother. - Aw. (crowd cheering) - [Woman] Here come the Red Ballers! - Hey, Roscoe, you're not supposed to be hangin' around here. - Harold, I'm protecting you.

(drum rolling) - Homecoming is a ritual we perform just as the sun rises and sets. - I pick Peggy Sue up over here. Then I drive around the back stretch to give the car the best exposure. - Of course. - Baseball to football, and that old applesauce-- - Harold, look at your mom. - Oh God. I'll kill her! (coach shouts) (car engine revving) Aw, come on, ma! - Isn't he wonderful? - Kane, get back to the car. - Oh! - So where's Harold? - He told me to tell you he was impotent. - There's no I in the word team! No I in team! - Who's driving the car? - You're supposed to go the other way. - That's what they always say. - Hey! - Hey! - That's not Harold! - [Principal] Now it gives me great pleasure to officially declare-- - Roscoe, are you trying to abduct me? - Homecoming queen! - Who the hell, who the hell, who the hell is driving that goddamn, goddamn car? - It's Roscoe. - [Glen] He's stealing my car! - He's stealing my daughter! (gun firing) (cannon firing) - Harold! You're responsible. And I want the car back intact! - Bentley! Follow that car! - The parked one? - I've got Peggy Sue's crown. - Come with me. You can deliver it in person. - I'll handle this. Go back, get back on the field! Get back on the field! Get back on the field!

Stop or I'll shoot! - Heck, you shoot me, I'll hang you! - You'll never live to see it! (calliope music) - See 'em? - Naw.

If I ever get my hands on him, I tell you there's no power on God's brown earth gonna keep me from killin' that son of a bitch.

Give me those cigarettes! - Hope you're proud, busting babies. - Did you see a young couple in a stolen Pontiac? She's beautiful, and he's definitely retarded. - I saw 'em, but they're not in a Pontiac. - [Turner] What are they in? - I'm into Luckys. - Tobacco will kill you. - Here you are. - Oldsmobile station wagon, towing a boat, license 700-DTW. - 700-DTW. Which way did they go? - They went that-a-way, sheriff. - That-a-way. Ah, thank ya, honey. - I hate corrupting a little kid like that. - Man, this turns so slow, a couple yokels are catchin' us in a pickup. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh my God, that's daddy. - Oh no! It's got no zip to it. Come on. - He's right on our tail. Oh, come on, do something. (tires squealing) (polka music) (car crashing) (gas tanks exploding) (tires squealing) - Shit. (coughs) Dammit. (coughs) (sultry music) - Hey there, charger. Hoagie. Well now, need a boost? - I need a rest, because my back, you know. All I really need, Nellie, is your car. (laughs) - Oh no, you don't, now, Hoagie. That's a big hot no-no. - War is hell, Nell. - Get outta there, Hoagie. (Nell shouts) - So I told Helen, hey, book the little shit on indecent shortness. Hey, you're not Nellie. - Thanks. - This thing's dyin' on us. - So we gotta get another one. - [Man] This time, just superb. I know it'll be fantastic. (whistles) No, no, no, that's perfectly all right. - Nice car, sir. - Good afternoon. (car starting) Come back, you swine! That cheeky young couple stole my car! - Ooh. Look what I found. - [Roscoe] Yeah. (tires squealing) (lively music) (siren wailing) - Are you just going to ignore me? - Lady, I'm drivin'. I'm drivin'. (chickens clucking) - Watch out! (screams) (car crashes) (screams) - Ah, yeah. Now I'll get outta here. Oh! Feathers? (car crashes) - Ah, he won't hurt ya. Glen! - [Glen] Hello down there. - Put out an APB on that black Chevy coupe. (calliope music) - Sheriff Bleed. Come on, join the party. - You boys got a lot to answer for, deputy, in a Knotsie County court. - Aw, come on, what the hell, sheriff? It's off the taxpayers' ass anyhow. Come on and have a beer. - Beer? - [Pilot] Then he crossed Red Creek Bridge. - [Glen] The car thieves are heading for Red Creed Bridge now. - [Turner] Roger, Glen, I'm on my way. - And you're looking very palsy-walsy. (laughs) (siren wailing) - It's okay, it's okay. (brakes screeching) (car crashing) (blues-rock music) (siren wailing) (car crashing) (glass breaking) (siren wailing) (rock music) (whistle tweeting) (screaming) - [Lifeguard] Whoa! Shit. (female deputy screams) - [Roscoe] Ha ha, smokey bites the dust. - [Peggy Sue] Have a nice swim, daddy. (speaking foreign language) (mariachi music) - Freeze, police! Hey! My mother, she's drowning. Yeah. - Sheriff, stop! (cycling through various types of music on radio) - [Girl] Hey, you guys, look! (people shouting) (cheering) - Turner! I'm gonna pull his ass up around his neck and choke him to death! He's done wrecked all my cars! - Come on, let's go! Turk, you drive. Just remember they got away from my pals from Frankenstan. - We'll get 'em for you, Les! (classical music) (sirens wailing) - Wow. (tires squealing) - Hey, how about a ride? Oh! Hey! Not on my feathers. Oh. Oh no. Slow down. Hey. Hey! God. Oh. (spits) Bastards. (sirens wailing) (laughing) Oh yeah. Oh boy. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Uh. Damn. Ah, oh! Ow. Oh God. Which way, I don't know. (laughs) (sirens wailing) - Root beer. Thirsty. Root beer. Root beer. - Bentley, what happened to your car? - I'm dying, Lester. - Well, you'd better have a hot plate of SpaghettiOs and plenty of beer. - Root, root, root. (tires squealing) (sirens wailing) (helicopter rotors beating) (cycling through various types of music on radio) - Glen, I think I've lost 'em. - [Glen] They must be in that Rolls Royce I just spotted. I can't think what the hell a car like that is doin' way out here, but they're goin' crazy on north two four eight. (sirens wailing) (speaking foreign language) (mariachi music) (speaking foreign language) (car exploding) - They lost us. - For how long? - [Radio Reporter] Every lane, freeway, highway, and byway in the surrounding four counties has been blocked by the Highway Patrol. There is no way anything on wheels can get through. - [Roscoe] Ain't that a bitch. - No more wheels. Can we get a plane? - No. I can't fly. But I can sail. - Me too! - Let's go back to Snake Lake, we'll get a racing boat, and head out Big Mo. - Saint Lou. - New Orleans. - All right! - We're gonna whip it. - Whip it good. - Who owns this car? - [Woman] It's mine. - Let me have the keys, ma'am. Let me have the keys. (dog barking) Move over. I'm an officer of the law. Move over. This is an emergency, dammit. (tires squealing) - You know what I'm? - What is? - Thirsty. - Very, very thirsty I'm. - First oasis, pulling in. - Sure. - Hello, down there. Can you hear me? The Rolls Royce is crossin' the barrens toward Snake Lake. We'll stick to them like shit to a blanket. (Middle Eastern music) (gun firing) They're shooting? - Shooting bullets. - They're shooting! - Bullets! - Shooting! - [Pilot] Yes. - This has got a reverse? - Yes. - Well, use it. Let's get the hell outta here! - Oh shit! (helicopter rotors beating) - I shoulda asked for two million. Here they are. - Now, let it straight me get. Two ass's milk, two mint tea, two goat's eyes, and one camelburger. - Salami. - Salami? - Salami. - Salami! - Habib, is that you? - Ah, much greetings, Miss Lester. It is gorgeous for to look on you. - The wise men. - Why don't we from here get away secluded to for our privates? - Oh, you wanna be private? - Ah. - Well, that's a good idea. We could just walk over here to Snake Lake. Nobody ever turns up there. - Snakey Lakey, it for us. (dog barking) - Chief! - [Peggy Sue] It's daddy. Quick, let's take the Rolls. - Hey, Peggy Sue! Hey, Peggy Sue! Oh God! - Hey! Hey! Stop, stop, wait! Peggy Sue! I don't wanna shoot! Come back here! Oh, goddamn. (dog barking) - You got 'em, chief. They went down to the boat dock. It's a dead end. - Where in the hell have you been all day, Bentley? God, it's like you got the gallopin' ringworm, boy. Put yourself on report. - Yes, sir. Aw. - Thanks for the ride, fellas. Have a good one. - Thank you. (dramatic music) - Thanks, y'all. - [Man] Here's your ball. - Thanks a lot. Harold. - Oh hi, Kenny. - I'm gonna tear your insides out. - Look out, Harold. Don't hit him, you're gonna hurt him! - [Roscoe] Come on, let's go! Oh wow, I've never hotwired one of these babies. (screams) (car exploding) - Some dork just wiped out over there. Whoa. - Hang on a minute. I'm thinkin'. Ah man, I can't hotwire this baby. Let's get another boat at Badlay Beach. Come on. - [Cindy] Look out. You're gonna hurt him. Look out, Harold. Be careful, Harold. Oh, Harold, look out. Oh, Harold, get up. Look out. - Beer for everybody. I'm buying. (laughs) - [Cindy] Watch out. (Kenny roars) You're gonna hurt him. - What are they fighting about? - Who cares? Listen, if the sheriff comes back, tell him I've taken a shortcut to the lake. - Ooh. Oh! (Middle Eastern music) - Well, this is my end. Let's see the one million clams. - Well, Miss Lester, you are a trusting man thinking I'm. Yohara. (speaking foreign language) One million clams. - This some kind of joke? - Yohara. Kosemik. Head of infidel yon stump put upon. Six buckets Kentucky sour mash and two buckets Georgia turpentine, one quart barn varnish, (gasps) one pint coon oil. - [Arab] Coon? Coon? - Jackal oil okay? - Yeah, fine, fine. - [Habib] Three kegs mule sweat or four kegs donkey juice. - We've gotta save Lester. - Yeah. Come on. - One pound chicken lips. We don't got chickens. We use vultures. Sounds it correct. Head off. - Lester, you can't just go wander off. You're still under arrest. - Make it a double. (speaking foreign language) - Freeze, camel jockeys. - Ooh, terrific. - I'll mow you down. - Goddamn, boy, you saved our neck. - Sheriff oughta let you off now, Roscoe. - He oughta give you an unconditional pardon. - [Lester and Bentley] But he won't. (brakes screeching) - Have you seen Sheriff Turner? Have you seen Sheriff Turner? Have you seen Sheriff Turner? - No, I haven't. - Have you seen Sheriff Turner? - They're all at the lake. - Ball. - I'll make you a deal. You arrest me, and I'll let the Arabs go. - Oh, I don't know about that. You let them go, they'll cut off my head. - Is that right? (all Arabs agreeing) Well, Porky, the only thing to do is let me go, right? I mean, it's simple-- (roars) (screams) - Up. Up, up. Up the hands. Up, up. The infidel down put. Now, my turn it's. - Look what you did, buddy. - How was I supposed to know you was bein' attacked by pirates? - Oh! - Ah, poor lady. I can of assistance be? Ah! - Ah-hah, ah-hah! I got you. Hands up. Now get on over here. - Lester, Lester! - Huh? - You shouldn't have that gun. - What? - You're still under arrest. - For Chrissakes, Bentley! - Gimme that gun. Line it up! - Watch it, watch it! - Do that, I'll pump 20 rounds. Move it out! Move it. You too, numb nuts. All right, now, line it up. Grab some sky. Fun's over. We're goin' to the cars. You got it? - Ah-hah! Hold it. (gun firing) - Geez! - I gotcha, you jerk. - Daddy, how could you? - Shut up. You're under arrest for car theft, kidnappin', and everything else. And the rest of you can go home. (gun firing) Bleed! (calliope music) - Everybody here's free to go except Sheriff Turner. - But here's that damn fool that was tryin' to rob those poor Arabs. - They was tryin' to chop off my head. - You expect me to believe that? - That's a solemn fact of record, chief. - I regard it as bullshit. - [Arab] All right, now in charge I'm! - [Habib] I'm? - [Arab] We'm. - [Habib] Head of infidel on stump put. Put! - You've gotta be kiddin' me. - No, I'm very serious. (speaking foreign language) - Hold it, old pecker. (all shouting) - Very, very beautiful. - Wait a second. - What? - Harold! - Harold, gimme the gun! - Here's your crown. - What, I ask you, is the point in growing up? - [Harold] I'm not gonna let you get away with this, Roscoe! - You can stuff it. - Why? Why we do, we do this? We could brothers be. - Brothers? Habib! - Bentley? Bentley! (crying) - Oh, crap. - [Deputy] We've been looking for you. - You take him. I'll take him. - Sorry, coach. - Harold, Harold! Aw, he'll be all right. Come on, Peggy. - Please don't die. - Okay. - Care for a dip? - I'd love to. - Why not? Well, which way do you wanna swim? East St. Louis or west Colorado? - Well, it doesn't matter as long as we're together. - Yeah. (laughs) Hey, what the? - You can say that again.
