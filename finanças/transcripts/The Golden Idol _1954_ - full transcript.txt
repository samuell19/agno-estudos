[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [dog barking] [hen clucking] [dog barking] [music continues] You are Hawkins, effendi? - That's right. - Good. You are punctual. His Excellency will be pleased. This your entire safari? No. The rest of it will be along in a little while. Oh, I see. Well, there's no need to wait for them. His Excellency is waiting. Gomo? If I'm not back in an hour, you better bring your men and come looking for me. Yes, bwana. [instrumental music] Your pardon, effendi. I must take your gun. That's not an easy thing to do, my friend as long as it's loaded. It is a rule. His Excellency does not see armed strangers. Well, in that case, the interview is over. But the emir is expecting you, effendi. That's just the point. If I ask for the meeting I'd accept it on his terms but I didn't. I think His Excellency will make an exception in this case. If I'm mistaken, the responsibility will be mine. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] The man Hawkins Your Excellency sent for. You came more promptly than I expected, Mr. Hawkins. This man is armed, Abdullah. I do not receive armed strangers in my house, effendi. That's what your man said. Then why are you carrying a gun? Because no one ever sends for me unless he has a job he wants done. For the kind of jobs I do, this is my tool kit. Apparently, you do not trust me? Probably as much as you trust me. I see. I think we should get along very well together, my friend. Everything is in readiness, Your Excellency. - Shall we proceed? - Of course. Of course. What is this proposition of yours? That can wait. I've arranged some rather special entertainment. [clapping] What's all that for? Have patience, my friend. You are about to see something that you have never seen before. [instrumental music] [tiger growling] A Bengal tiger in Africa? I had it imported from Sumatra. [dramatic music] That's not an African boar. I had it brought in from Ceylon. What for? Watch. [dramatic music] [tiger growling] [boar squealing] [tiger growling] Stop it! Stop it! We don't want one of them killed. [boar squealing] [explosion] [dramatic music] As soon as their wounds heal we will have a repeat performance. That was quite a show, Your Excellency. But was it worth the trouble you went to to get it? Nothing is too much trouble if it'll get me the things I want. That's why I sent for you, effendi. [instrumental music] I have heard that you are the craftiest hunter in Africa. Also, the most unscrupulous. That takes in a lotta territory. I have a job for such a man if you are available. That depends on the job.. ...and the pay. The pay? You have perhaps heard of the Lost Idol of Watusi? Who hasn't? British authorities are offering a fortune to whoever finds it for them. I have found the idol, effendi. - You found the idol? - In the hut of a witch doctor. Named Ologa, over near the Tanganyika border. I see. Then you want me to steal it for you, is that it? - I bought the idol from Ologa-- - You bought it? And immediately sent a runner to the British Commissioner telling him to bring the reward to me here and pick up the idol. I don't see where I fit in if you already got the thing. It was stolen from me on the way here. - You mean, his tribe followed? - Not a tribe, one man! When I get my hands on him, I'll feed him-- One man? Didn't you have any guards with you? Of course. But this was not an ordinary man. It was.. I hope you will not laugh at what I'm about to ask you but...have you perhaps heard the legend of a jungle man named Bomba? He's no legend, my friend. I've seen him. A dozen times he's robbed my traps. Then you understand. He followed us into the jungle. We found his footprints but thought they meant tribesmen. So, I deployed my men and we hurried on hoping to outrun them. Since you know this Bomba you know that he's a devil in human form. A devil with a strength of a gorilla and the cunning of a snake. While we watched the jungle ahead and on either side of the path for native warriors he was watching us from cover, laying his plans. [instrumental music] I learned afterward from my men just what happened. [gunshot] First, he allowed two of them to catch a glimpse of him and thus lured them away from the main body into a place that suited his purpose. [music continues] He let the first one pass and attacked the second. Thus he had only one to fight at a time. And no one man can stand up to him alone. That was the essence of his strategy. To follow us through the jungle and attack us one by one. Always choosing the last man of the party working silently to avoid alarming the others and employing tricks that ordinary men would not even think of. For one, he laid a snare made of a soft liana. Using his own weight as a lever he hoisted his victim high in the air and left him dangling. [music continues] [laughing] Then he again took to the branches and vines to follow us soundlessly in our flight along the trail. And as we hurried on our way never even suspecting his presence, he continued to attack where and when it best suited his plans. And always choosing the rear guard as his victim. My men were the pick of the palace guards. But after all, they were only men and no match for a jungle devil who swung like an ape through the trees and struck without warning. [dramatic music] I swung my rifle around to kill him, but as I fired he threw the guard in front of him as a shield. [gunshot] Then began a chase in which the advantage should have been mine, for I was armed and he was not. [music continues] Again and again he offered himself as an open target and each time darted to cover in time to avoid my fire. In the end, my ammunition was exhausted and now the advantage was his. I dropped my useless rifle and tried to escape by flight. But even as I ran, I knew that my plight was hopeless. [music continues] He watched me run down a winding path then took a shortcut to a spot I would have to pass. There he lay in wait for me. The end now was all too obvious. I am not a jungle animal and no match for him in strength. I made a desperate attempt to escape but he was too quick for me. I defended myself as best I could but my best was not good enough. And in the end, I fell unconscious to the ground. [birds chirping] And when I came to, I was alone. And the idol, of course, was gone. I want it back, effendi. And I want the jungle boy, so that I can see him suffer for what he did to me. That's a tall order. It'll take time. I must have it within a week. The commissioner is on his way here. I'll give you ten percent of the reward. Better start raising your sights, my friend. I know this jungle boy. He's no pushover. Very well, 15, and I will furnish the riflemen and the safari bearers. Make it 20 percent and I'll take my own boys. It won't be so one-sided in case we don't agree. Very well. We start at dawn tomorrow. We start within the hour. He lives somewhere among the rocks on Mount Kaleri. It's a long trek and time is short. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] You and your guards take my safari boys and head for Bomba's cave. Make camp near there and wait for me. What do you intend to do? Gomo's men and I'll scout around this section and join you later. Pass the word to the men, Gomo. [speaking in foreign language] You're wasting your time, effendi. Maybe, but it's my time I'll be wasting. [instrumental music] [music continues] Gomo, spread the men out. We'll see if we can pick up his tracks. [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] [elephant trumpeting] Bwana, look, elephants. [elephants trumpeting] No, that's great. They'll trample out any tracks he might have left. [elephant trumpeting] Well, we might as well relax and wait till they've gone by. [instrumental music] Wait, bwana, look. [dramatic music] [cocks gun] No, wait a minute, Gomo. He's no use to us dead. Only wound him, bwana. The shot would stampede that herd and they'd trample him. Maybe us. Go get Ali. Bring him here on the double. We'll follow him and leave a trail for you. Yes, bwana. [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] [crows cawing] [instrumental music] Prince Ali! Wait! Bwana Hawkins say come quick, have found Bomba. You two stay with the safari. The others come with us. [dramatic music] [Kimbbo chattering] [dramatic music] Here's our jungle boy. We'll spread out and close in on him from all sides. Wait. He's waiting for someone. He's waving to them. Who the devil is it? It's probably the commissioner on his way to my village to get the Golden Idol. It looks like Bomba. It is Bomba. Head for shore, Eli. It is the commissioner. The game's over and we've lost. Not yet, we haven't. Just means we'll have to change our plans a little, that's all. What have you got in mind? Gimme a minute to think, I'm not a magician. Take your boys back with the safari out of sight. Yes, bwana. [speaking in foreign language] Stay here and see what happens. Strange sort of apparition is that, Mr. Barnes? It's no apparition, lass but I doubt you'll believe it even when you meet him. Who is he? He's a lad who was raised among the animals, and likes them better than his own kind. [hooting] - Hello, Bomba! - Hello, Mr. Barnes. There's a better place just ahead. [hooting] Bomba, it's good to see ya. The more so as I didn't expect ya. Always good to see you, Mr. Barnes. And you too, Eli. Eli always glad to see friend. Got another friend too. [speaking in foreign language] This is Ezekial. Maybe you call him Zeke, same as me. [speaking in foreign language] I brought you here some very special company this time, Bomba. Looks like they're gonna make camp. Have you seen anything of the idol? No, not yet. Bomba, Ms. Marsh. I fancy she'll let you call her Karen. She says she doesn't quite believe you. I do now. I hope you will call me Karen. Thank you. [speaking in foreign language] Eli, this calls for a celebration. - We'll make camp here tonight. - Yes, bwana. Get away from river. Maybe lose mosquitoes. Very good. Well, that's a mighty nice-lookin' gal they've got with 'em. [grunting] You haven't told me what you're doing so far from home. Mr. Barnes is taking me to Ali Ben Mamoud's village. - Are you friend of Prince Ali? - No. I'm just-- Karen is something of an expert on archeology. Ali has a relic that the museum she works for has been after for 40 years. Archeology? Relic? It's a little figurine. The last evidence of a lost civilization. I doubt you've heard of it, Bomba. It's called the Golden Idol of Watusi. Ali located it and brought it from old Ologa. - He lies. - You're wrong, Bomba. He sent a runner to the commissioner describing it and claiming the reward. He didn't buy it from Ologa. He tortured him with fire to get it. Impossible. Men don't resort to torture nowadays. Chief Ologa was my friend. I found him dying where they left him and carried him to his village. Then Ali has no right to the idol. The government'll take it from him-- He hasn't got it. I have. You have it? I followed Ali and took it. Chief Ologa asked me to get the reward to help his people. I knew you would help me get it. Of course, I would. But why didn't you bring it to me? Ali has men scattered in the jungle hoping I'd try that. Well, now that I'm here, you can bring it. He wouldn't hesitate to attack you either if he knew. No one will find it where I hid it. But, suppose something should happen to you then, then the idol would be lost forever. Nothing will happen to me. It's not likely, but if it did there'll be no money for Ologa's people. They are very poor.. ...and there's sickness among them. I'll go for the idol after dark. Good. We'll go and see how camp's gettin' on. If you don't mind, I'd like to cool off first. If the river's safe for swimming. I know where there's a place. See you later at camp. [Kimbbo hooting] I'm not sure he's got the idol with him or he'd have produced it by now. Then all we have to do is capture him and make him tell us where it's hidden. Sounds simple, but Bomba's tough. I'm not sure you could break him. I'd enjoy trying even though I don't get the idol. You can do what you like with him after we get the idol. Until then, you lay off, is that clear? And I suppose you know how to find it. Certainly. Wait till he brings it to him, then move in. What could be simpler? Attacking British officials in Africa is not to be recommended, effendi. After we're through with 'em, who's gonna know? Even so, we'll be never be able to sell the idol to the museum. I know a dozen places we can sell it for more than the museum will pay. [instrumental music] Are you sure there're no crocodiles? I'm sure, I'll show you. That was easy anybody can do that. [instrumental music] [laughing] Alright. I'll show you why there's not so easy. Gomo. I want you to slip over to their camp. Get near enough, so you can see everything that happens, understand? - Yes, bwana. - No, wait. When Bomba leaves to get the idol.. Wait a minute. There's a better way to play this. - Yes? - Why don't I join their party? - Are you out of your mind? - I don't think so. They don't know we're working together and I've got a hunter's permit. Sure, it's bound to work. You two go down to where their boat is, tow it upstream. Now, if you're seen, don't stop to fight just get that boat. I don't understand all this. You don't have to. Do nothing and stay out of sight. I'll bring the idol to you on a platter. Gomo, call your boys. [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [grunting] [screaming] Look over there. [instrumental music] Let Zeke take care of this, Eli. Better grab a gun and try and catch some game for supper. Yes, bwana. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] (Bomba) 'Easy, now.' [birds chirping] You stay here while I go find my dressing room. [grunting] [crow cawing] [hooting] [lion roaring] [dramatic music] Karen! 'There's a lion prowling..' 'Don't move. If you run, he'll chase you.' [dramatic music] [lion roars] Mr. Barnes! Mr. Barnes, lion! 'Mr. Barnes! Mr. Barnes, lion!' 'Mr. Barnes!' 'Mr. Barnes!' 'Mr. Barnes, lion!' 'Mr. Barnes!' [growling] [intense music] [growling] [growling] [gunshots] Thank you. I'll be alright now. - What happened? - Look over there. He was too strong for me. These men got here just in time. I'm glad we could help. We were trekking through when we heard the young lady call. I wanna thank you for myself as well as for Bomba. Deputy Commissioner Barnes, Harrison's Landing. Andy Barnes? Now this is a lucky break. I'm Joe Hawkins, ivory hunter. I was on my way to your station to check on the boundaries of-- We'll talk about that later. We're taking care of Bomba. Oh, yes, of course. Gomo, get the safari. We'll make camp with these people tonight. - Yes, bwana. - We'll manage, Karen. Better get some clothes on before the gnats eat ya alive. [birds chirping] [monkey chattering] The cuts aren't deep. It's only infection we have to guard against. That oughta fix it. Now, what about that ivory-hunting permit, Hawkins? Well, I just wanted to stay within the law, sir. - I understand-- - Eli come, bwana. Boat gone, bwana! Men stole it. Ah, probably the current carried if off. - Nobody'd steal it. - Two men, bwana. I crossed track in brush, follow to the river, men took boat. - But it doesn't make sense. - Maybe it does. What kind of tracks, Eli? Not natives? Not native, not English boot. Look more like Arab. Ali Ben Mamoud. But he'd be the last one to take it. He's waiting for us at his village. (Hawkins) 'You're mistaken, miss.' - He isn't at his village. - He must be. He sent word for us to meet him there. Well, I'm sorry, sir, but I meet him and his riflemen on the trail at dawn. Now that I think about it, he wasn't too happy when he saw me. Maybe hunting Bomba, like he say, to get idol. And they stole the boat so you couldn't get away in it. You know, it's probably none of my business but what's all this about an idol? Eli shouldn't have mentioned it. Ah, but I oughta guess there's no harm in letting you know. 'You've heard of the Golden Idol of Watusi, maybe?' I certainly have, sir. Bomba has it. Ali wants it. You don't mean you've actually got it here in camp? I have it hidden but I was going after it tonight. That's pretty risky. He's probably got spies out. I can feel them peering from behind every bush. I am afraid we'll be open for attack, Bomba. You know, on second thought, I believe we're worrying about nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Ali hasn't got enough men to attack a party the size of ours. But you're not going our way, are you? Friends don't run out on each other in the jungle, Ms. Marsh. Then we will be able to get the idol out in spite of Prince Ali. I'll go for it tonight. Well, then we have nothing more to worry about. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Send a runner to Ali. Tell him to keep his men undercover. Bomba's going after the idol tonight. [speaking in foreign language] If you're gonna get back by daybreak hadn't you better be starting? Yes, soon. If Ali's spies are watching, how do you expect to get away without being seen? I'll send out a spy of my own to see if the way is clear. [speaking in foreign language] [chattering] [instrumental music] You expect that chimp to come back and report to you, do you, Bomba? Don't act surprised at what I'm saying, Karen. - Bomba's gone. - Gone? The chimp was a red herring. The spies, if any, were watching it instead of Bomba. [instrumental music] I bet I don't sleep a wink until he gets back. You'd better. We've got a long trip ahead of us tomorrow. [instrumental music] [chattering] [music continues] We could capture him, Your Excellency. You could keep all the reward. It's just what I was thinking. Wait. Wait until he passes us. [intense music] Now! [gunshot] Good! Sounds like Bomba didn't make it past Ali's men. Get the guns, Eli, we'll find out. No, you stay and guard Ms. Marsh. My men and I'll take care of this. Gomo. [speaking in foreign language] [intense music] Get inside, Karen. Keep to the shadows. [speaking in foreign language] Face the jungle. He's alive. Pick him up. Tie the thongs to his thumbs. [chattering] [intense music] [chattering] [gunshot] Bwana. You're gonna save your life by telling me where you hid the idol you stole from me. I was hoping you'd refuse. Toss the ends of those thongs over that limb. And build a small fire under it. (Hawkins) 'Hold it.' Your Excellency is a prize fool. You're an even greater fool if you try anything like that. If you hadn't interfered, we'd have had the idol by morning. (Ali) 'Don't worry, he'll tell us' 'where it's hidden within an hour.' (Hawkins) 'That I doubt.' 'You're not dealing with a sick old native now.' If he won't talk, I'll match him with that tiger you saw in my palace. You think that bothers him? It may be easy for you to kill me but then you'll never know where the idol is. Well, from here on, this deal is mine. I'll give the orders and you get the 20 percent you offered me. You must be mad. I hired you! And tried to cross me. Now, you play it on my terms or not at all. I'm in no position to argue, effendi but I won't forget this. Your Excellency scares me to death. Tie his hands behind him. Stick this in his mouth. How can he tell us what we wanna know if has a gag in his mouth? We'll make him talk, alright. But you'd never be able to do it by torturing him. Do as I said. Men come, bwana. Maybe friends, maybe Ali, not sure. It's Hawkins. - Ali's made Bomba a prisoner. - Where is he? He's bringing him in. So you can drop your guns and back away from 'em. What sort of a stupid joke is this, Hawkins? This is no joke, commissioner. Drop those guns. [intense music] [gunshots] Alright, Ali. [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] Now, why don't you give her the treatment you started to give Bomba? [intense music] Ow! Ow! [music continues] [sobs] Now, do we get the idol? (Karen) 'Ow!' Alright, where is it? It's under Mount Kaleri. An underground waterway leads to it from Pongola Basin. You swim down under and.. I could go right to it. I could never tell you how to find it. He lies. It's a trick to get away. It's the truth! Turn me loose and I'll get it for you. How long will it take you? I'll be back my noon tomorrow. Untie his hands. You don't really believe he'll come back, do you? I'm sure he will. If he's back by sundown, Ms. Marsh will still be alive. Just to play safe, send two men with him. Hassan. You and Mustafa go with him. But I can travel faster alone. I'm sure you can. And go straight to the police for help. Very well. But it's a long run, my friends. Tie them up for the night, Gomo. You take the first watch, I'll relieve you in an hour. [speaking in foreign language] Well, the rest of us might as well turn in. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [laughing] Wait! You'll have to go slower. We can't keep up. We can't get back unless we run. I know how fast we can go! [gunshot] I say slower! [instrumental music] [intense music] [thuds] [instrumental music] [music continues] - Eli. - 'Shh.' Go untie Ms. Karen. [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] Bwana Hawkins. Wake up! - What's the matter, Gomo? - Prisoners gone. Gone? How did they get away? Something hit me on head. When come to, prisoners gone. That jungle devil. I told you he'd get away! - How long have they been gone? - Not know, bwana. Maybe five minutes. Maybe two hours. Not know. There's something moving in the shadows. [gunshots] - Well, I got one of 'em. - Are you hurt, Eli? No, bwana. Tripped over root. Get out there and run 'em down. [speaking in foreign language] [intense music] [speaking in foreign language] [gunshot] [music continues] Eli.. We can't outrun them. [music continues] - They go this way, Gomo? - Can't tell, bwana. Too dark. Spread your men out and hunt them down. We haven't a chance in the dark. They may be a half a mile from here or hiding within a 100 feet. Well, we're wasting time. Where'd you hide the boat? In the brush, in a little pool, half a mile upstream. (Hawkins) They'll head for Pongola Basin. Gomo, take your men and get there ahead of them. Yes, bwana. We'll take the boat and meet them there. [intense music] I know short way to Pongola Basin, bwana. Good. Take it on the double. [dramatic music] Slow down! Simba. Lion. [intense music] [thuds] [grunts] [music continues] [thuds] [drum music] Talk drums, bwana. Talking drums. - What do they say, Nadji? - They say need help. Bomba, big trouble. Pongola Basin. Say come quick. Get the guns and canteens. [boat engine revving] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] I'm sorry, I.. - I just can't go any farther. - You've got to, Karen. Pongola Basin just ahead, miss. Come on. [instrumental music] This Pongola Basin. Not know where underwater passage is. Well, if he doesn't show up soon we'll have to head to the station and get help. Can't you get any more speed out of that motor? If I could, we'd have been there an hour ago. [intense music] We can't wait any longer. We have to get Ms. Karen back to safety. Yes, bwana. [Kimbbo chattering] Bwana, Kimbbo! [Kimbbo chattering] [Kimbbo hooting] [hooting] Kimbbo want me to go with her. Maybe she know where Bomba is. [Kimbbo hooting] [dramatic music] [Kimbbo hooting] What is she doing? [Kimbbo chattering] Do you suppose she's showing us the underground waterway? She couldn't possibly know. Must be, bwana. [instrumental music] Bomba! We would've gone without you if it hadn't been for Kimbbo. How did you get away from Hawkins? Kimbbo knock out guard with rock. I've got the idol. We've got to get out of here. Their bound to have trailed you. [instrumental music] [boat engine revving] Don't shoot. Start running. Do as I say. I'll take care of 'em. And don't stop to fight. [instrumental music] [Karen coughs] Look, Mr. Barnes! [gunshot] This way. [gunshot] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] It's no use. We'll have to make a stand. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshot] [music continues] Ali! [dramatic music] [music continues] Ali, help! 'Ali!' Ah! Help! [music continues] [gunshots] More shells, bwana. Take it easy. There's only four left. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] [gunshots] Drop your guns, all of ya! The drum said something about Hawkins and Prince Ali. - Where are they? - They're at the stream. Bomba's with them. You and Graves cover these men. Eli, come with me. This one's alive. Prince Ali drowned. [Hawkins coughing] [engine cranking] So, that's the ugly little thing that caused all the trouble, is it? It's not ugly, it's beautiful. And it's a priceless treasure, Mr. Reed. Why, I guess that's just a matter of opinion. But is it worth all the trouble it caused? It will bring much good to Ologa's people. Aye, there's that. I've forgotten, lad. (Eli) 'Boat ready, bwana.' Then, we'll be out, we'll have to travel all night to reach the station. That's not as bad as the little trek we have ahead of us. [dramatic music] Good luck to you, Ms. Marsh, and to your idol. You sit in the back, Mr. Barnes Bomba will sit upfront beside me. Why, he's gone. Gone? Without giving us a chance to thank him. No need to thank Bomba with words, lass. He has an odd way of knowing what's in men's hearts. Shove us off, will you, Reed? [engine revving] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music]
