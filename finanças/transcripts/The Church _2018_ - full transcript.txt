♪ LOOKING AT A MOUNTAIN ♪ ♪ AS FAR AS EYES CAN SEE ♪ ♪ STOP ONE STEP IN TIME ♪ What got you all riled up? The pastor and those damn church people are really pissing me off. Why are you complaining about them? Today's not Sunday. Plenty of parking spaces on the block. Nah, it has nothing to do with parking, I promise you that. It's much bigger than parking. Here, look at this. What's this? That, my friend, is my brother and I's ticket out of this shithole neighborhood. Looks like you've got yourself an offer to buy your old man's house. So why are you so mad at the church people? The pastor. Alright, man? He keeps declining to sell, which is holding up the deal which is holding up our money. Yeah, and it doesn't make any sense because that church is beat down, and he ain't doing anything but holding the whole neighborhood hostage. Yeah, listen. That, that pastor's up there and he's preaching every Sunday how you should better the community. Now's his chance. He could sell it, make a couple duckets, give it to the community center before that gets closed down, too. But nah, he's all talk. - Why don't you go talk to him? - Talk to him about what? Maybe if it hears, he hears something from people in the community, he'll reconsider. Pffff. No, no, no, no. No, that's a good idea. Let's go talk to the pastor. Oh, oka-- Hey, Jimmy, you keep that. I'll be back, alright? We'r-we're gonna go talk to the pastor, alright? - Thanks, Jimmy. - All right. Yeah, uh, we'll be back. Haha. Ha. Look at this place, man. Yeah, I don't like churches, man. The whole life and death thing just f-freaks me out. Listen, man, knock it off with that sissy talk. We're here to conduct business and that's it. - You got me? - All right, yeah. I got you s-- - Can I help you? - Jesus, no! - Go get the pastor. - Do you have an appointment? - No. But we're here for business, so go get him. I'm sorry, gentlemen, but he has already left for the day. Can I take a message? Yeah, I'm Dan. This is my brother Joe. We want to know why he's not sellin' off this building. Listen, we got a lot of property. Y-you know what, Flo, you can't help us. Go get the pastor. Get him on the phone. - Go do what you got to do. - Yeah, yeah. Do something. Get out of here. - Please calm down, gentlemen. - Yeah, what? - If you have a seat, - This is us calm. I can get somebody to help you. Nah, Flo. We'll stand. We're good. Don't worry about it. Just go get the pastor, will you? I will be right back. - All right, yeah. Come back. - You will be, sweetness. Man, this building is old. All the more reason to sell it off. Hello? It's been three months. Do you need me to step i--? Dad, I don't need you to hold my hand. Look, you're tying up a lot of Lawson funds working on this deal. I'll postpone the vacation. I'll meet with the preacher. Make sure we're not pumpin' money into a dead horse. Oh dad, I don't need your help on this, okay? I can handle this. You go do whatever it is that you do on vacation. When you get back this will be done. Okay. Okay? I'll go. I trust you'll get it done. And I'll see you when you get back, alright? Mr. Lawson, Mr. Arcos called and said that he will be be in town for a convention, and he would like to know your availability for a meeting. Yeah, uh, just, uh, schedule him for Monday afternoon. Okay. I need to get this done. Okay, Arcos is one of my newest and biggest backers. And he sought me out to make his mark in the US. Honestly, I've never even heard of the guy, but if he wants to give me his foreign money, then I cannot let him lose faith. I mean, I'm sure for this meeting, he's probably gonna want some kind of progress report. Just put a squeeze on the pastor. Doin' the best I can short of extortion. Well, then sweeten the offer. I already did, twice, and he's not accepting. How are you making out with Adu? Come on. Don't worry about boy genius, okay? He's a rookie. He's got all that new money burnin' a hole in his pocket. You know he's dealing with allegations that he stole his idea from his old business partner? I mean, nobody wants to touch the guy. He's a lock. - Trust me. - Great. Do you have any idea how important this is? I mean, this is finally my chance to get out of my father's shadow. You know, I've put literally everything into this project. We need this deal to go through or we lose all respectability. Looks like I'm gonna have to go to church Sunday. ♪ PRAISE THE LORD ♪ I wish we had a church like that. Modern mega churches, their ministries are constantly evolving and growing. Those are nice, but I'm not leaving my church. It's only a building. It's more than just a building. It happens to be my family legacy, and I have an obligation to make sure that the spirit stays alive. Our membership is dwindling because our members have been migrating to these newer churches. How can we compete? And on top of that our church is falling apart. Yes, well that's why we have a building fund-- Oh, no. This so-called building fund can't even fix the small problems that we have now. How is it going to fund the major renovations? No, we need to sell! That's enough! Look, sweetheart, it is Sunday morning. I-I've got to get my head right to deliver today's sermon. It's gonna be okay. Yeah, tell me about it. Yeah, I'm worried he won't get it done. Yeah, well why don't you shoot me the number of your heavy. See if we can't shake this pastor off his cross. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'll keep you posted. Thanks. Elizabeth? Yeah. Okay, I'm on my way. It's fifty-one-o-- So-sorry. Fifty-one-O-one. Yeah, see you at the church. Morning, Maria. Good morning, Pastor. Ooh, kinda cold in here. Did you, uh, turn the heat on this morning? The heat went out on Thursday. The HVAC company came in yesterday, but they didn't have the part that they needed to fix it in stock, because the unit is so old. They told me they will call me when it comes in. Okay, well, I guess we'll just have to make do. - It's freezing in here. - Oh, it's not that bad. It'll be warm in no time at all. Mm-hmm. Look, I'm not gonna let a little cold push me into making a rash decision. Little cold? Every day it's something else. All the money is going to repairs. There's nothing left for improvements. Please, Loretta, not now. All I'm saying is that you should take them up on their offer to sell the church. Then we can move forward and have a new building like everyone else. You're selling the church? No! Oh, okay. Everything is clean and ready for service. Do you want anything else before we start? No, no, thank you, I'm fine. Okay. You see what you just did? If she goes out and tells the congregation, this office is gonna be flooded with questions. You know, that might not be a bad thing. I mean you have an obligation to your members to do anything and everything for the good of this church and this ministry. It's wrong to keep this from them. I am not selling the church. Well, will you at least think about it? He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress. My God, in him will I trust. Surely, he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Shit! - Thank you, Pastor. - Thank you Amazing sermon! Thank you. - How can I help you? - Uh, I'm Ron Lawson, head of Lawson Development Corp., and this is my beautiful assistant, Elizabeth. Hello. And I believe the question here is how can we help you? You help me? I, I don't understand. It's, it's simple really. Imagine a new ministry, a new building, a new place to reach out to the community, a place where air circulation, heating, and other simple but important amenities are all at a preacher of your status' fingertips. Hear me out. Boom, mega screen. Boom, mega screen. Two-thousand plus people watching you every week deliver your sermon right up close, not a bad seat in the house. Hell, I can do it for you. Matter of fact, I'll build that for you. You know I'm not interested in selling the church. So if you're finished, I have some work to do. Okay, okay. Look, no problem. You know it's just, mmm. It would be such a shame if you just let an opportunity for your ministry and for yourself go by like this. Elizabeth. Let's just say that's a little something to get you forward-thinking. We'll be in touch. Wow. This is amazing. Look at this. I mean, it's okay. Okay? It's more than okay. Do you know what we can do with a building like this? I mean, think about it. Food programs, summer camp, even a school. Yeah, why can't we do that here? Eric, be serious. I mean have you looked around? What you have to realize is that this ministry is not the building. This ministry is what you make it. Look, this building is embedded in my family history. I mean generations of families have worshiped here. We got married here. And that's all you're gonna end up with in this church is your family. Everyone else is gonna be worshiping somewhere else. Look, I'm not letting them come in and knock down the church just so they can build some more stores and apartment buildings. I mean the community needs us. We can build nearby. What's in here, more pictures? Ahahahaha. What kind of a man do they think I am? That is totally disrespectful. No. You give so much to the community. Maybe this is God's way of giving something back to you. Oh, like this? God works in mysterious ways. Think about it. When was the last time you had a vacation, a new car, oh, or a new house? Well, how much is that? A lot of money. God, that could really help us. See, that's the spirit. Get out of the way! Go! Jesus Christ almighty. Get out of the-- Noooo! Mr. Lawson, Mr. Arcos is here. Andrei, how're you doin'? Hello. Hi. Good to see you. Uh, take a seat. - Adrian? - How are you? We'll actually get started as soon as everyone arrives. Are we expecting any more guests? Mr. Lawson, Mr. Adu. Oh, Simon? - Hello, Ron. - Good to see you This is our investment partner, Andrei Arcos. - Nice to meet you. - Uh, take a seat. Adrian? How are you today? - Good. - Are you excited, huh? 'Cause it's gonna be big. Of course, I'm excited. It's a pleasure to work on this development with you. So, what did I miss? I was asking about the Treville development, if there is any progress? Yes. And actually we have all the residential lots all under contract. What about the church? We, uhh, we hit some snags, but I'm pretty confident that we're gonna have the deal done by the end of the week. Good, good news. How can you be so sure? Let's just say, uh, his donation cup filleth over. Ron showed him the big picture. By the end of the week he'll be begging us to buy that dump. I guess sometimes we have to be ruthless to get ahead. Ain't that right, Simon? Yeah, I, I guess. By the end of the week. Yes, by the end of the week. Great job, guys. Keep pressing. I'll be in town for a few more days. Great talk, thank you. Keep me posted. Ahh. Mm. So what are we gonna do when your husband gets back from deployment? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. You haven't thought about it yet? No. Just enjoying our time. Okay. Besides we have nine months to figure it out. I'll be right back. So, have you convinced him to sell? Almost, but I'm not worried. That's why I put you in charge of the trustee board. I need an ally. Hmm. I know. I doubt if he'll vote for a move, no matter how much money we offer him. That's why I haven't spoken to him. But I'm not worried. I'm sure we can get the vote without the deacons. Excuse me. Hello. - Thanks for coming. - Thanks for having me. Please, come in. Have a seat. My pleasure. Veronica and I were just talking about the votes. Oh, okay. So let me sum up what we are facing here. The charter of the church allows the pastor to make decisions without involvement of the board, except for relocation, denomination, and financial expenditures over $10,000. So in order to move forward on any matter that falls within these exceptions, a vote of yes from two out of the three boards and the pastor is needed. Now Loretta, I'm quite sure you'll handle the pastor. Of course. How do you think we got this far? Great, great. Has anyone spoken to Joan? We're definitely gonna need the stewardess board because it will be almost impossible to have the deacons on board. That's what Loretta was saying before you came over. That Deacon Williams, he is an Old Testament stiff. If it was up to him, he would live and die in that church. - Mm-hmm. - But I did speak to Joan, and she's already planting the seeds with the stewardess. Good. So, Ron told me he made a little trip to the church. - Really? - Yep. I think I'm owed a thank you! - Yes, you are. - Hmm. Thank you. Oh, here you go. I think this calls for a toast. To a new building, to more members, and most importantly, more money. I second that. This is what you preach about, the good life. How about we, uh, just have dinner and talk about the future? Hmm? Okay. Hmm. - That is something. - Mm-hmm. After you. Thank you. Good morning, church family. Good morning. As some of you may know, there is a company called the Lawson Development Corporation and they are proposing to build a mixed use complex right on the spot here. What? It is my job as your pastor to investigate any and all, uh, possibilities of expanding both the church and our ministry. The Lawson Corporation has made a very attractive offer for this building. Now, if you look in your packets, what you see are pictures of a new church that they have proposed-- These, um, drawings are okay, but our spirithood, the soul of this ministry is in the walls of this church. Yes, but if you think about it, uh, actually the, the spirit and soul of this ministry lies within each and every one of us. I think it's a great idea. Wait, wait. We can give back so much more to the community in a building like that. What would we do there that we can't do here? Now, calm down. Calm down, everybody. Um, you'll all have a chance to express your opinion in the form of a vote. And now, as you know, church doctrine states that I can't make a decision of this magnitude without the support of the boards. So, uh, what I think we should do is, uh, basically the boards need to repair their different chambers and uh, discuss the proposal and uh, vote on it. So, follow your conscience and pray before you vote. I counted them twice. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, before we find out the results, there is one thing I'd like to say and that is, quite simply, that no matter what the vote our church and our ministry will continue to grow and prosper. If we stay, we will find the money to return this church to prominence. And if we sell, we'll embrace the new building as our home. Either way, it's part of God's plan. Amen! Amen! Amen. Okay. The trustee board votes four to one to sell. The deacon board votes four to one to stay. - Why? Who-- - It wasn't me. The stewardess board, Pastor, hey, what's the good word? Well, a decision has been made. Yeah? Our board has voted to sell the church. Mm. But we do have conditions. No, that's, that's great. Yeah, any, absolutely anything you want. Matter of fact, why don't you and I get together next week, and we can scout some new locations? So, uh, what about the money in the envelope? Never existed. Looks like you have yourself a deal. Why don't we get together Friday. Uh, how's six p.m. work at the church? Friday at six p.m. works for me. Okay, I'll bring my guys over and get this done. Okay, see you then. All right, hey and, uh, and pastor, you, you really saved me. - Hello? - Hey, Simon, hold on. Hey, Ron? Simon, Arcos, it's Ron. What's up? We got the church. - Ha! Fantastic. - Wow, that was fast. Who did you have to sleep with? What? Just kidding. Great job, Ron. Yeah, um, well, I got to get going. I got to call, uh, Adrian. But we're gonna meet on Friday at six p.m. We'll finish the deal, okay? Yeah, mate. I'm thrilled. I can't wait to cut the ribbon. All right, guys. Okay, bye. - Great. Yup. - Alright, see you soon. Mmm! Elizabeth! Ah, it's beautiful. It's even more beautiful in person. Look at these marble floors. This is beautiful. - This is great. - Oh, I'm so excited. I am, too. This is what we've always prayed for. I kno-- Come on. Let me show you the kitchen and a pool out back. It's amazing. You know what? - We'll take it! - Oh, my God. -Hahahahahaha Oh, this is my dream house. Oh, muah! Thank you. So, Veronica, if you want to take one last look at proposal here, you can see things are gonna be really, really good. Beautiful ring. How long have you been married? Just one year. Newlyweds. Congrats. Thanks. Marriage is a beautiful thing, cherished in my country, more so than in the United States, I guess. Yes, good evening. - Good evening, Pastor. - Is everybody ready? Yes. Joan is just getting your notes out of your office. Good evening, Pastor. - Good to see you. - Hello. - Uh, these are the investors I was telling you about. At the end here we've got Simon Adu, Yes, hi. I read an article about you. My kids love your website. Great. Thank you And here we have Andrei Arcos. He is a global developer and investor. Global developer? That sounds very exciting. It's okay. And with the, the help of these guys, we are gonna turn this area into a first class neighborhood. Oh, you can do that without, uh, tearing down this church. Deacon. It's fine. Some people are not this easily persuaded as others. So, what do you say we make this official? Elizabeth, my lucky pen. Here you are. Pastor? Good night. Oh, good night, Maria. See ya' Sunday. What was that? Uh, Oh, probably just some kids outside. - Yeah. - I-I'll go check it out. Ahh, these kids in this neighbor- Ahhhhh! Oh! - Eric! Help me! - Loretta! - Eric, get me down! - Woah! What the hell happened? - Eric! - What is going on? Nohoho no! Boss, come on. Let's go. Pastor, you must remain strong. For the congregation. Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's get this stuff. - Come on, hey! - Come on, let's go, let's go, - let's go, let's go. - Come on, let's go. Hey, let's get the hell out of he-- Where is Simon? We've got to find my wife. Pastor, why don't you lead us out of here. Come on, everybody. Let's go. Loretta? - Eric? Eric? Answer me. I've never seen this before. Let's get the lights. Except in a storm. I think we might be in a storm. But a different kind. What do you mean by that? Eric. Eric. Eric Eric! Yeah. Yeah. Oh. In my country we have an old myth. If the leaders of the church are not pure, then the church engulfs their spirits and holds them within until they are released for judgment. The, the church what? That doesn't make any sense. Boss, there ain't nobody in there, all right? All right, look. Simon's probably just upstairs. I mean, what, they can go down there. We're goin' upstairs. We're gonna find Simon, and we're gonna get the hell out of here. - Let's go. - Let's go. Ugh! Damn. Ugh! I'm trapped. Can anyone hear me? Oh. Hey, just go! Alright? Go! Do you think we're gonna find Simo-- Look, look, I don't know, but let's look downstairs, okay? Well at least if they do find the others, they can tell them that we're here looking for them. Loretta? Hopefully. Something about this place just isn't right. What was that? What was what? - No, no, no, no. Go back! - Simon. Hey Simon! - There's something in here. - What's going on? Simon? - What's going on? Simon! - Open the door. - I don't hear anything. I didn't hear anything, either. That sounds like it was in the sanctuary. Well, let's get up there. Come on, quickly. Oh, God. Please help me. You gotta push, kid. Push harder. Come on. Yo, Arcos, come on. - What's going on? - Come on, mate. - Open the door! - Open the door! - Come on, come on! - Open the door Simon Adrian, break this damn door down! Ah! Ahh! Damn it! Ronald! Ah! Ugh! Oh! Jesus. What? What's happening? A great panic from the Lord will be among them. Open these doors! Why won't you let us go! Ron? Adrian? Come on, mates. Adrian? I'm not leaving without Loretta. We're not gonna find Loretta. You just saw what happened to Simon. The church has them. They're not coming back. Listen to her. You have to save yourself. Loretta's gone. Arragh! We're trapped in our own church. I can't push anymore. We're wastin' our time here. You got any tools in this place? Oh, my God. Downstairs in the storage room. Okay. Let me go get something and let me get these doors open, okay? Did you not just see what happened? You're not going anywhere and we are not splitting up. It doesn't matter. We're not getting out of here. The church is keeping us here. Oh, please, stop with that Romanian myth! True or not, what are we supposed to do, stand still here and die? Hey, listen, guys. Listen. We will get the tools. Everybody relax. And I'll be back, okay? Just sit tight. The- Careful, Deacon. Please, let me go. Whatever you are. Please, let me go. Ahh! Ahh! Ughh. Ahh. Ah. whatever you want me to do. Tell me what you want me to do. Please, please, please let me go. Ahh! Ahhh! Oh, my God! - Mel, Mel! - Joan, are you okay? Where were you? - I, I, I saw-- You saw what? - Did you see Loretta? - No. I, I saw. Ahh! Joan! Where did she go? She was just here. What did she mean I saw? Ahhh!!! Boss, boss! What happened? I heard screaming. I came as fast as I could. It's Joan. - Did you find her? - She found us. We just lost her. I'll got check the kitchen! Veronica! Hey, Boss. I've had enough of this, alright? I'm gonna go get these tools, okay? I'm not spending another minute here. We're gettin' out of here. You understand? She's not here. Why isn't she here? She's not anywhere. What do you think is happening to us? I have no logical or a biblical explanation. It could be the devil's work. Do you believe what Andrei said? No. If all myths were true, then the world would be like this. - Alright, - Alright, alright, wait, wait - Wait! - Hey, listen here, Pastor. I'm getting' tired of you. You understand, okay? I'm not gonna wait and die here tonight with all those creeps and ghouls in the wall. You got me? I'm goin' home tonight. You understand me? Now move out of my way. Watch out. - Adrian, let's go. - No. You go. I'll wait here. Hello? Help me! Can you help me? Dear God. It won't open. Arrrgh-yahh! Ahhh!!! Oh, my God! Veronica! Let me in here. Please, I've got you. Easy, I've got you. What are you doing, what's she doing? - She's frozen, she can't move. - Veronica What do you mean, she's frozen? Veronica? Try to lift her up. Try to l-- C'mon, get her up. C'mon. - I felt it. - Felt what? Felt what? - I'll be back. I'm going to get some tools. Ugh! Adrian, no. Don't, don't go by yourself! Adrian! Adrian! Ugh. I rebuke you, devil. I rebuke all the evilness you bring. Surrender to the power of the holy spirit. This is the holy spirit. No! God may move in mysterious ways, but not like this. Wait. Joan said, "I saw you." What could she have been talking about? Look, stop it! We are in a church. We were all together. Who knows what she saw. You're probably right. She was just scared out of her mind. That can happen when you have a spirit chasing you. Alright, enough! Enough with this shit already, okay? Gods, spirits, whatever. Obviously, something's going on. So, what's the deal? Was this place built on, on a cemetery of something? No. Look, for all we know whatever it was is gone now. Save Veronica. She's still here. - Yes. - What is with you people? Do something. Why aren't you doing something? - You're a pastor. - Calm down, okay? Calm down. Hey. Just-- What? I'm sorry, Pastor, but according to the tale, the spirit will not leave until he has taken every unpure soul within this church. Well, I guess that counts me out. What about you? No angel, but I'm not evil. Well, let's let your so-called spirit be the judge of that. I suggest that we all sit down and talk this out and devise a plan. Hmm! - Ugh! - Adrian! Ugh-ahh! Let's go take care of business. Ah. So is it my turn now? Huh? Huh, come on. Huh? How about it? Come and take me. Come on! Hughh! Hughh! Ugh! Aghh! Yeah, come on. Hughh! Ughhh! Go ahead and take it. Come on. You want some? Ah! no, no! Stop! Ah! Ah! No! Nooo! Ah! Get off me! This place is crazy! Ahh, ahh, ahh! Get off me, get off me! You son of a bitch, come on! I'll fight yous off! You sons of bitches! Come on, fight me. Huh? Come on, right here. He's still not back yet. He'll be back, okay? The guy's tougher 'than a two dollar steak. You don't get it, do you? You can't fight something you can't see. The outcome is already determined for us. Some will make it, some will not. You know I am so tired of hearing you talk about something you don't know anything about. I mean I have read the Bible back and forth. I-I've never heard of that. Pastor James, I have held my tongue, but I won't any longer and I think it is time to consider what he's saying. At least he has an explanation for what is going on. I know I don't have one. Do you? God damn! You're not taking me. You're not taking me! Ah, Ahh! Ugh. So what do we do now? We wait. What are we waiting for? For Adrian. Alright? He, he will be back with something to get us out of here. - The whole-- - Uh, don't start! Fine. Adrian is never coming back, is he? He'll be back. Okay, Andrei. Now, I'm a pastor, so I'm probably the purest one here. Why don't you go ahead and tell the story behind your myth. I'm sure I'm gonna feel the same way about it when you're done. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Shoot. Ahhh! Shhhhhoot! Great! He's gone! No need to look for him. You won't find him. Nice theory, huh? Nice freaking theory. Loretta? Loretta! Fu-- - God damn! - It's you. Isn't it? Me? What? What are you talkin' about? You have something to do with all of this. I can feel it! No, no, no. I've been here with you the whole time. - No. - Don't blame me! Miss Haines? Miss Haines, I can understand your frustration, but I don't believe that he is at fault. He is behind this. How? We've been together all night. Explain how he knows so much about this biblical myth. Look, I'm not possessed or a devil's advocate. I just know a story that was passed down through my families in my country. I didn't think of it being true until tonight. True? You think that all this is true? - Look around you. - Bullshit! Adrian, it's about time. There's nobody there. What do you mean there's no one there? He's got-- He's not there. How could he not, how could he not be there? Who opened the door? I'm still surprised you have to ask that question. I don't care who opened the door. I'm just happy that it's open. Let's get out of here! I'm not going anywhere near him. I'm the least of your worries. I will keep an eye on him. Trust me. Now come on, let's go quickly, now. Now! I feel like whatever the spirit is, it's playing with us. It's tellin' us where to go. Well, think about how the doors opened. It's obviously containing us until it wants us to move, whi-- Andrei, do you know anything more about the myth that can help us? I wish, but I told you all I know. Loretta? Over here. Ah! - Damn! - Did you expect that to open? Wishful thinking at This point. So close. Isn't it ironic? - What? - That we're in a sanctuary. Isn't this where God is? Isn't this supposed to be a safe haven? And for us, it's the total opposite. Hey, I'm gonna go upstairs, all right, on the balcony. Maybe one of these windows or something's open. Good. You check that one out. We'll check out the other side. I'll try these. You two see if you can get the other windows open down there. Ughh! Ahh! Ugh! Of course they won't open. Dear Lord, release us, I beg you. Set us free. No luck! Do you, do you see that? What? Eyes. The eyes are following me. All right. Elizabeth, I don't see anything. I'm telling you. The picture is watching me. Hey! Elizabeth? Hmm? Let's get you home, okay? This place is playing mind games with us. Andrei? I'm okay. Dude, there's something in here. I know. I can feel it. Come on. Let's leave. He is here! We have to help them! Ohh! Nobody was taken. Oh, my God. - Eric? - Help me! I have to find a way out. This might be the end. I hope so. Oh, no! Damn it! I thought this was over. Where are you when we need you, God? Huh? Where are you when we need you? We're all gonna die. No, we're not. Hey! Elizabeth, we are not gonna die. Come on.
