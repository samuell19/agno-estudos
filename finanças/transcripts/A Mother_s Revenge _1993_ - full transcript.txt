(enigmatic synth music) (calming music) - Come on, mom, hurry up. - I'm coming! - I'm gonna win. - You are not. (calming music) - Carol Sanders falling behind. - Morning. - Morning. (Wendy giggles) - Who got surprised? - She beat me by a step. - It could be by 10. - Yours are on deck. - Oh good. Clowns will come within 10 seconds. I gotta hurry, I got the club luncheon today. - Oh, uh Raulston called. - Really? - Hm-mm, looks like we got the account. Guaranteed three flights a week Los Angeles. - You're kidding. - No, no I'm going down there today, firm it up. - That's great dad. - You worked hard for this, you deserve it. - Yes I do. - (laughs) stop. - Frank, Frank! Hurry up, you're gonna be late for work. Your eggs are gonna get cold. - Sorry mom, just not hungry. - You've got to eat something. - Just not hungry, I'm not hungry. - Well, what (indistinct) I've just made? - See you later. - Honey, have you seen my log book? - [Carol] Yeah, by the phone. - Tied around my neck. So what's it today, falafel 4:40. - Do you want to never rescue the (indistinct) do you? - Well, actually I do and it's an old family recipe - Where's Jill? - Three guesses - Great, she'll be late for school again. - I'll go get her. - Okay. - Jill, you have to wake up. Come on Jill, you have to get up. - Leave me alone. No Wendy, you can't borrow it. - But I was just looking at it. - It's not you, it won't even fit. Give it. Boy, is it not you. - But I just want to look at it. Come on. - Would you get out. - Just let me see it. - Wendy, stop it, this is my leather jacket. - [Wendy] Come on, just let me-- - [Jill] You're always messing with things you shouldn't even mess with. Let go, Wendy. Let go. - Come on, enough. Get ready for school, Jill eat your breakfast. - Mom, I don't eat breakfast. You know, fighting with me is one thing but that kid's crazy about you. - She's in the dweeb stage mom, I'll bond with her later okay. - I don't have time for your attitude. Just get in there eat what's on the table and get to school. - Oh, God. (exciting music) - Hi Mr. Warden. - Hi. - Oh, Western Juniper's huh. - Correct. I'm impressed. - Thanks. - Come on let's go, we're gonna be late. - Natalie just called, she can't work the luncheon. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I gotta pick up Wendy at school at five. She's working on a science project. - I can't do it. - Bill, please. - I won't be back from Los Angeles till seven. Get your other one, she'll be done-- - Jill, I can't even get her to school on time. It's not funny. What, I... - You love me. - Yeah, I love you. Okay look fine, I'll just finish everything. That's all, I'll just do it. (slow piano music) - What kind of researcher? - A medical researcher. I'm thinking of Stanford. - Well, you're certainly good enough in math and science. But I worry about what it's going to cost when you're ready to go. Oh you're so good in math and science, you'll probably get a scholarship. - Well, my mom and dad have been saving since I was born. - Do you need something? - No, just surprised anybody else was putting an overtime around here besides me. - Great, okay let's start arranging these by the flowers. And alternate them, all right. Thanks so much for coming. I've been lost without you today. (people chattering in the background) Hi, Jill Sanders please, it's her mom. - Hello. - [Carol] Hi sweetheart. - Hi. - [Carol] Listen, I need you to do a favor for me. - What? - I'm running really late and you've gotta pick up Wendy at school. - Mom, I already made plays with Brian today. - I'll let you get those earrings. - [Jill] Yeah, I can brag. - Good, thanks. Don't be late, okay, five o'clock. - I won't, I won't. - [Carol] Okay, talk to you later, bye. - Bye. - Wendy are you sure you wouldn't like me to wait with you? Well, I could even give you a ride home myself. - What time is it? - Five to 5:00. - I'm fine Mrs. Hyde. My mom will be here any second, she's never late. - Well okay. See you tomorrow honey. - Bye. - Bye. (slow music) (woman laughing) - (indistinct) get into something that really puts it heavy. All right, I appreciate (indistinct). Okay, bye. - Excuse me, could you like uh recommend something for somebody you just left and rain in the parking lot. - Give me a break, okay. - Oh my gosh. - You got nothing to worry about. Hey, I'm all yours. (indistinct) - Oh my God. - What? - Oh my God, my mom told me to pick up Wendy. It's 10 after 5:00. How did this happen? Where's my jacket? I gotta go, I gotta go. - All right, see you. (somber piano music) - Still here? - Just waiting for my mom. - She's late, huh. - She'll be here in a second. - Wanna wait inside? - No, I'm okay. (suspenseful music) (car honking) (suspenseful music) - Why don't you use the phone, call somebody. - No, I'm okay. - Sure now? - Hmm-mm. (eerie music) (car engine revving) (somber music) (phone rings) (suspenseful music) - Wendy? Wendy? Wendy? (suspenseful music) Wendy? Wendy? Is she here? - What? - Is Wendy here? - What do you mean? You were supposed to pick her up. - I know, I looked everywhere. I can't find her. - Are you sure you looked everywhere all over school? - I looked everywhere. Oh God her books were lying on the ground in front of the school. - Jill, calm down, calm down sweetheart. - I know something is wrong. - Come on, let's go. - I'm coming too. - No, you stay here. Try calling her friends. (somber music) Wendy? Wendy, it's dad, you in there? - I mean she had like had to go home with one of her friends or something, right? - That's probably right, honey. Why don't you look down back there. Wendy? Wendy? Wendy? (phone rings) - Hello. - Carol, anything? - No, one's seen her. - I'm calling the police. - [Woman] Right away. - Sorry. - Where were you? It's 7:15, I was getting worried. - Decided to run home and clean up a little bit. - I'm flattered, what's the occasion? - The occasion is you're special ma. And I'm buying tonight. - No Frank, you can't afford it. - No, no, no, I insist. - You okay? - I'm fine, ma. Ma, I'm fine. - Let's eat. - I'm starving. (indistinct) - Mr. Sanders, I'm not sure, but we found what possibly could be blood out back. Now, just in case, I need to know Wendy's blood type, just as a formality. - O positive. - We'll be up all night, I've got every available man working on this. We're gonna question all the employees at the school and anybody that might have seen something. - Okay. - You go home. - No, I wanna say till-- - I know you do, but I think you might be needed at home. (radio chatter) - Is Jill asleep? - No, no, she can't sleep. She's fine. Sorry. - I know she's okay. I don't know what went wrong but I know she's okay. Tell me I'm right. (sobbing) (knocks on door) - Did you find her? - Yeah. - She all right? - I'm not sure. We found her up at Culbertson road. She's been raped and beaten very very badly. (suspenseful music) (phone rings) - She's comatose. It might be brain damage, we won't know for sure until she comes around. Neurosurgeon's with her now. - So, that means she will just be okay, right. No permanent damage or anything? - That's right. She's broken her forearm. Four cracked ribs and contusions all over. Now look, I've given you the worst part. The good part is it was just critical. She's stable and that's remarkable considering what she's been through. There's a good chance for a full recovery if she comes out of this coma in the next 24 to 48 hours, even up to 72 hours, still promising. But after that-- - Oh my God (sobbing) - [Woman] Dr. Martinez, report to OR room five. (somber music) (suspenseful music) - I called your mother, she's on her way. Police have a couple of leads, but they don't know whether it was somebody she knew or somebody passing through. - If she doesn't come back, I don't know what I'm gonna do. (children speaking in the background) - Carol, honey, it's been decided now, you're going home. - Come on, you (indistinct). - No. - Come on, you've been here two days now. - No, no, doctor said. The doctor said she could come at any minute. I wanna be here in case she does. - Come on. Jill is waiting downstairs to take you home. I'm worried about you. So, let this doctor and I will call you if there's any change, I promise. Come on. (somber music) - Hello. Finally. No, no. There's no change. (somber music) - Where's your grandma. - She's like still in the cafeteria. - You okay? - Dad, I'm sorry. - For what? - I just feel like this is like all my fault. - No, honey, it's not your fault. - I mean I was the one, you know, who was supposed to pick her up one time. I just never thought that... - You're not to blame. Nobody's is to blame, it just happened. It's one of those things that happened. - You know mom blames me. - No, she doesn't. - Yeah, she does. The car right now, she didn't talk to me, she didn't look at me. - She doesn't blame you, honey. She is sick with grief, she's worried. She's just not (indistinct). She doesn't blame you, I know that. (phone rings) - Hello. Hello. Is anyone there? Who is this? - How is she? - [Carol] Who is this? - Is she gonna pull through? - Who is this? Tell me, damn it. - No, no, no, no, you tell her. You tell her to be quiet 'cause I can hurt her again. (suspenseful music) - Thank you. Carol what's up? - [Carol] Is Wendy okay? - Yeah she's fine, what's wrong? - He called here. - Who? - [Carol] He threatened to hurt her again. - What? - I'm afraid he's gonna kill her. - All right, now just calm down. I'll call the police. (dramatic music) What's the matter, what's wrong? Everything's under control. - No, it's not. Not while he's still out there. - He won't be for long. - You have to find him. You have to find him, I don't think you understand. I think he wants to kill her. - Mrs. Sanders, we're very close. And until we get him, we've posted a guard at Wendy's door 24 hours a day. There is no way he can get to her. She'll be safe, don't worry. - Frank, these men want to see you. - Frank Warden, police. Get up slowly, we've got a warrant for your arrest for the rape and assault of Wendy Sanders. Get up. I've also got in order to impound your car. - Is this some kind of joke, I didn't do nothing. - You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - Please, do something. - You have the right to speak with an attorney and have an attorney present during questioning. - I didn't do nothing, ma. - If you desire and cannot afford one-- - [Frank] I didn't do nothing, I swear to God. - Mr. Sanders, we got him. His name is Frank Warden, he's been a janitor at Wendy's school for three months. He's got two prior charges on molestation in California. - God, how does a guy like I get hired? - He's never been in trouble in this state. It didn't show up on the screening for the job. But we have good forensic evidence. The lab found a hair in his car, it's Wendy's. Look, there's gonna be an evidentiary hearing in three days. A judge will review the case and make sure the evidence is good enough to go to trial. - But there's no problem, right? He's the right guy? - It's just a formality. The Assistant DA says it's a slam dunk. - Thanks. ♪ Little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder where you are ♪ Come back home, sweetheart. Please Wendy, I miss you so much. You know what, I can't go running without you. I need my running mate. Wendy please. - It looks like Frank Warden got himself a top attorney. - Well, everybody gets an attorney. - Yeah well, not everyone gets Ellen Wells. She was the one that got the cop killer off last year remember. And she's a clever one. - It doesn't matter, they have him and they have evidence. She can't do anything about that. (journalists chattering) - Dave, you know better than that. I'm not gonna say anything till after the hearing. - Can you tell us anything about the crime? - (indistinct) do you think of what he's done? - My son is innocent, he did nothing wrong. - How do you feel about these accusations? (chattering continues) - How can you do this? How can you defend him after what he's done to my daughter? - No verdict has been handed down yet, Mrs. Sanders and everyone deserves the best defense. - Well, I guess you just have to believe that, don't you just to keep going. - There's no doubt then that the hair found in the car registered to the defendant Frank Warden. No doubt that the hair came from the victim, Wendy Sanders. - None. The hair sample found the car was a perfect match with the one taken from the Sanders girl. - Thank you. That's it your honor. - Dr. Hall, I read your report and I have no doubt whatsoever that the hair you found in my client's car matches the hair of the victim. What I do have doubts about are the procedures used by the police once Mr. Warden's car was impounded. - I don't understand. - No, I don't understand. Frank Warden's car was taken for an evidence search but it sat in front of a police garage unguarded for eight hours before you and your team called it. - Your honor, is Ms. Wells suggesting that evidence was planted? - Not necessarily. - Then what? - Chain of evidence, your honor. Police arrested my client in the house he shares with his mother. A tow truck towed the car from there to the lab but it was not escorted by a police officer. - Oh, come on now. - Chain of evidence from the time the car was taken to the time dr hall discovered the tell-tale hair in it, it was left unguarded, unsecured four times, a total of nine hours 25 minutes. - Your honor, there is absolutely no indication whatsoever that any evidence tampering went on. - As there is no proof that any sort of evidence tampering didn't go on the chain of evidence was broken not once but several times and therefore such evidence is not admissible. And even though Mr. Post has studiously avoided revealing this, the court must know that Frank Warden routinely left his keys in his car and that any number of friends and associates knew this and just as routinely borrowed it often without permission. There's simply no telling how a hair from the victim got into the car. What's setting aside the car now? Was there any other forensic evidence found on the victim herself. Any blood, tissue or semen? - No blood, tissue or semen from the victim's assailant was found, no. - That's all, Dr. Hall, thank you. Your honor, since the evidence against my client is tainted. - Wait, we do know that the accused was the only one in the school at the time. - No, we don't. He was seen at the school before four o'clock but no one can place him there after that and we know the victim wasn't abducted until closer to five. Mr. Warden was gone by then and I have a witness who can verify that. - Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? - Yes, I do. - Be seated. Mrs. Warden, did you meet with your son on the night in question? - Yes, that's the night we have dinner together every week. - Where do you meet? - At Arman's restaurant out near the interstate. - Do you have a special time you meet? - At five o'clock always. - And was Frank late? - He was right on time. - Would you lie under oath to protect your son. - No, Ms. Wells, I would not. - Thank you. your honor I know detectives questioned restaurant personnel regarding the time Frank Warden showed up that night. - They served hundreds of people a day there. No one could say exactly what time Mr. Warden was there. - No, but they could verify that he was indeed there. Your honor, the district attorney's office rushed to indictment on this case, which is understandable considering the crime. But we must separate the emotions in the community from the process of law with which we're charged. Since there is not enough evidence against my client, I move that all charges against him be dismissed - Mr. Post, if your office turns out more conclusive evidence, you may pursue a new indictment against the defendant. For now, I have no choice but to dismiss all charges against him. - All rise. - Mrs. Wells, I need to talk to you. - Yeah, I bet you wanna talk to me. (suspenseful music) (gunshots) (screams) - Help him please, help my son. - [Man] Profile please, turn to the right. - I was afraid. - [Bill] But what was it doing in your bag? - [Carol] I know that sounds strange but I didn't even remember that it was in here. - [Bill] I don't care if you forgot, why did you do that, why did you shoot him? - Do you think I planned this? Do you? - No. I don't know when to think, this whole thing is a nightmare and it keeps getting worse. - We made bail. - Yeah, how? - The house. - That couldn't have been enough. - I had to put a part of your business too. - Oh, jeez. Thank you Jack, I appreciate it. So what do we do now? - Well, you're gonna get your wife a decent attorney. - Well, I assumed you people would be doing that. - Bill, I'm your corporation and tax attorney. I'm not equipped to handle Carol's case. Nobody in my firm is. I hope you get the best attorney in town. Believe me, she's gonna need it. - In the eyes of the law, she shot an innocent man. And if he dies, she could be tried for murder. - Mr. Sanders, can you tell me what your wife is going to plead? - Well, I'm sorry, I have no comment. - Will it be justifiable homicide or is she going to plead temporary insanity? - Mr. Sanders told you, he has no comment. - Excuse me, excuse me, are you Carol Sanders husband? - Yes. - I just wanted to tell you how brave that I think your wife is. - Brave? - That man deserved everything he got and your wife was the only person who had the guts to do it. I saw everything on TV. Please, tell her that I'm rooting for her and I'm not the only one. - Better be prepared Bill. This is just the beginning. - Will you plead temporary insanity? (indistinct) - How do you see yourself, Mrs. Sanders? As a vigilante or a hero? - [Journalist] Mrs. Sanders, who's your lawyer? Mrs. Sanders can we have a comment, please. Mrs. Sanders, can we please have a comment? - Hi sweetheart, I'm back. I love you, angel. Can you hear me? I love you. I talked to the doctor today, he said you're getting so much better. You're such a strong girl. I know how you're fighting. - Jill? - Sweetheart, I'm back. (somber music) - Mom. - Wendy. You're safe Wendy, come back. Come back to me. Come back Wendy. - She was deeply unconscious before. Now, she's just barely under. - So, what does that mean? - Well, physically she's out of her coma. Psychologically, she's in withdrawal. She's just not ready to remember. - So you're saying she'll come out of that too then, right? - Oh yes. And when she does, she's gonna need all of your support and the best psychiatric help that's available. - I really need to get back. - Yeah listen, I'm worried about Jill. - Jill, the girl who hardly comes to see her sister. - She doesn't come here because you're here and she knows you're here and she thinks you don't wanna see her. - That's ridiculous. - Well, maybe not. You hardly ever talk to her. - Wendy needs me more than Jill does right now. - Maybe not. She thinks you blame her for this. Maybe you do. - That is so unfair. - Look, we need to be a family right now, Carol. We need to be together. - [Woman] Dr. Reid to ICU, Dr. Reid to ICU. - There's something else I need to talk to you about too now, we gotta choose a lawyer. Now, you haven't met with any of those people that-- - I thought you were gonna take care of all that. - Look, I met with all of them but you have to make the choice. It's your lawyer, you gotta choose. I mean you gotta take some responsibility here, Carol. - I'm the one that's up there holding her hand talking to her, willing her to come back-- - Well, who's gonna do that if you go to jail? Carol, who's gonna do that if you're convicted? Now we're in a hell of a jam here, we need to find the best possible criminal lawyer we can. - [Woman] Dr. Brandt to OR seven. - You can't be serious. - I am. I saw you in action and I think you're brilliant and I want you to be my attorney. - Mrs. Sanders, I only agreed to meet with you as a courtesy. If I'd known you were going to ask me to represent you, I never would have let you in here. Frank Warden is still alive, I still represent him. I'm afraid that's all I'm allowed to say to you legally. If you would like me to have my secretary compile a list of criminal attorneys, I could do that. Well, I do have one more question. How can you defend people like him, criminals? Guilty people? How can you live with yourself? - I could ask you the same question. I'm not the one who shot a man in cold blood. - Do you have children Ms. Wells? - Yes. - Do you love them? - Of course. - Would you do anything in your power to protect them, you know from anyone anywhere? - Mrs. Sanders, that's not the issue. - Well, I'm not proud of what I did and I live with that every day. But Frank Warden was not an innocent man and we both know that. He was guilty as sin and you let him go free. The man who raped my 12 year old daughter and left her for dead. You let his mother lie under oath. You knew all about it and you let it happen, all of it. You may not have killed a man, Ms. Wells, but you are every bit as guilty as I am. - I'm only guilty of representing my client to the best of my ability. In this country you're innocent until proven guilty, even you. - Mrs. Warden. - Go away. - Mrs. Warden, I'm in trouble, I need your help. - Go away. - Mrs. Warden, I can't go to jail. My daughter needs me she's very sick because of something you are son did to her. I know that it would be very hard to believe that, but it's true and you know it. Please, I just need you to tell the truth. - Get out of here. - Mrs. Warden, he will do it again. Just hear me out. - I can't hear you out Mrs. Sanders. I don't have the time. I have something that I have to do. I have to bury my son. Frank died an hour ago. You're a murderer Mrs. Sanders and you're going to jail for a very long time. And while you're there you can think about how your child needs you and about how I don't have mine anymore because of you. (somber music) - My God, I don't believe you. Ellen Wells, what in the hell is the matter with you? What were you thinking? - You said to get an attorney the best I could find. She's the best, isn't she? - That's not the point. - Isn't she's the best? - The point is she's the one that's responsible-- - The point is, - for the... - She's not gonna represent me anyway. So, this whole conversation's useless. - I spoke to Brody. He recommended Sabitsky, Graboff and Lee. I have a meeting there tomorrow. - Well good, that's good. Look, let's not fight, I don't wanna fight. We're on the same side, right? Right? - We're not fighting. - [Woman] Dr. Brandt, OR seven. Dr. Brandt, OR seven. - Mom? - Hey sweetheart, you're up. What's the matter? - Why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what? - About what happened, about Mr. Warden. About what you did. - There'll be lots of time to talk about that later. I just want you to use all your energy and all your concentration so you can get well, okay? - It's my fault, isn't it? - No, of course not. - I shouldn't let Mrs. Hyde take me home. - No, it's not your fault. - I don't understand. Mr. Warden was nice to me. He was my friend. I trusted him. Why did he hurt me? Why did he wanna hurt me? - I don't have an answer for that. And I'm not sure anybody does. - What about you? Are you gonna be okay? - Yes, I'm gonna be just fine. I'm so sorry. I love you, angel. - God, this is so strange grandma. I mean, this one says mom should run for congress. And then one yesterday says she's no better than Frank Warden. - We used to be such a normal family. - Why Jill? How could you after all your sister's been through? - What happened, what's going on? - She's making a little progress, just as she's starting to get a little better, you decide that she has to know about the trial, the murder, the shooting. What are you thinking? What are you thinking? - Mother, she asked me, okay? She heard people talking about it. - Well, I think that's an excuse and I think it's typical. - What was this supposed to do, lie to her? You wish it were me, don't you? You wish it were me in the hospital, not Wendy, not your favorite. - That's insane and I am sick of hearing you say things like that. I don't wanna hear that anymore. - It's true, you've always loved Wendy more than you've loved me. - I didn't know why you wanted to hurt me. I knew even before he started hitting me real hard. I knew I was gonna die. When I woke up in the hospital, I thought I was in heaven. I thought I was dead. - Who was the first person you saw? - Mommy, she was the first person I wanted and the first person I saw. - And what did you think? - I was just happy. Now I worry about mommy. (soft music) Dr. Raulston, I don't want her to go to jail. (soft music) - I thought we said everything we had to say in your office. - Things are different now Mrs. Sanders. Frank Warden is dead. I thought about what you said a lot. I've always believed that every person deserves the best defense possible. There's no way for me to understand why Frank Warden did what he did, but I do understand what you did. I understand your frustration and your rage. Whether you planned it or not, even if he was guilty, what you did was wrong. But if it had been my daughter that he raped, if he had tried to kill my daughter, I don't know what I would have done. In answer to your question, yes I would like to represent you. - She's working through it, it's tough. Wendy's dealing with so much, but she's getting better each day. Your being here every day has been extremely important. - Thank you. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. My trial is starting soon and I won't be able to be here as much as I've been, but Wendy's dad will and her sister as much as possible. The worst is over. There's still some rough times ahead but she's getting better each day. - No, I mean I'm just like way in the back of the picture. - No, you're not. - Brian really. Her priorities are all laid out. She's taking care of Wendy, getting ready for a trial, trying to keep dad from going insane. After that, there's not much time left for me. - Just tell her that... - Brian, I've tried. Tried 100 times. I think it was like this even before anything happened. (car engine revving) - Don't stop. I don't think everyone in the neighborhood has seen you yet. (tires screeching) - So, are you happy? - Do I look happy? - I know you should. You got to get out of me and make Brian feel real bad. I know you don't like him, I don't care. He is always there for me. - I think we're all aware of that. - Well, there might have been some other way to do it you know, to let me know you didn't like what we were doing besides doing your whole scene. It was pretty damn embarrassing. - No, embarrassing is your daughter almost dies and it's taking her months to come back and your other daughter sits parked in front of the house with her boyfriend necking so the whole neighborhood-- - You do blame me, don't you? - What are you talking about now? - For what happened to Wendy. - If only I had been there just two minutes sooner. You think about it every second-- - I don't blame anyone except Frank Warden. - That's a lie. - Jill, I love you, but I don't understand you sometimes. You don't seem to think of anyone's problems but your own and I don't have the time or the energy to deal with those right now. - Why don't we just admit it, you have never had the time or the energy to deal with me. You don't wanna deal with me. - That is so not true. - Yeah, because the truth hurts, doesn't it? - Just leave me alone. You can get away from me right now. - Stop it now, damn it. Stop it. Now listen, you know how this goes. Let me tell you how this goes. You both just yell until you get louder and louder and then one of you says something that you regret. And then you don't speak for a while. And then when you do, the whole damn thing starts over again. So please just stop it. - I cannot believe I got into that with her. - Oh, come on Tim. This kind of last minute crap is beneath you. Well, it used to be. It's a pot shot. Shoot at my expert maybe you'll get lucky and hit him please. So you're not backing off. Can you believe it, less than two weeks till the trial and the special prosecutor from the DAs office wants to exclude our expert witness. - The psychiatrist? - The pre-trial hearing is tomorrow and he's hoping to to weaken our temporary insanity defense. It's a low blow this close to the trial, especially since the judge is such a hard-liner. But if he disallows our shrink, I'll find something else and fight like hell with it, I promise you. Who knows, we might be able to play this into a continuance. - That'll be good, I'm sure that'll be fine. - What's wrong? - I had a fight with Jill and uh we said some really ugly things to each other. And she took off and I don't know where she is. - I realize how hard this must be for you and your family, but you've got to focus on the trial. - I know. - The pre-trial hearing is tomorrow and you need to concentrate on that. - Excuse me, Jill Sanders' mother. I called a little bit ago. - Sure, of course. I'm sorry Mrs. Sanders, I still haven't seen her. She hasn't been by. - What about Brian, have you heard from him? - No, I checked with the rest of the employees. No one's heard a word. Is Jill okay, Mrs. Sanders? Is she in any trouble? - I hope not, thank you. - Brian, where's Jill? Brian, talk to me. I need to know who she is, she's my daughter. - I don't know. I looked every place I thought she might be, I couldn't find her. - Call me if you hear from her. Thanks. (somber music) - So, Ms. Wells, where's your client? Doing a talk show? - No, your honor. In fact my client has turned down all requests for all kinds-- - Please Ms. Wells, spare us the media update, where is she? - Your honor, Mrs. Sanders has been so preoccupied with caring for her daughter that she can barely keep track of what hour it is let alone what day. - I'm sure you're not trying to sell me some sort of a schedule mix-up, correct? - Correct your honor. - All right, now regarding Mr. Reimer's motion to exclude your expert witness, Dr. Green, motion denied. Now the next time we see each other, I want Carol Sanders here. - She will be. - She better because I've set a firm trial date for Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. before Judge Roth. - She will be here, I promise. - Well if she isn't, I'm going to issue a bench warrant for her arrest, which means her bail is revoked and she'll be spending her trial in jail. - [Man] All rise. - Mr. Sanders. - I don't know where the hell she is. I'm looking everywhere for her. - She's got to realize this judge will eat her alive. I told her that, I told you that. How could you let this happen? - Well, I didn't let this happen. There's a lot of stuff that's been going on at our home Ms. Wells. - I know that. I know how tough it is, but she's gotta get her priorities straight. - Well, that's quite a statement coming from someone like you. - It would seem to me that the first priority would be to get Carol acquitted. - Look, you just do for her what you did for Frank Warden, we'll get along fine. - That's what I'm trying to do, but I can't do anything if she doesn't show up. - Right, fine. (dramatic music) - I've been thinking about what you said that I blamed you for what happened to Wendy. Maybe I did. I was looking to blame someone, anyone. I was in so much pain. But it wasn't fair, Jill. I couldn't admit the truth that I blame myself. I couldn't face the truth, that's why I was so angry at you and everybody. - Mom, none of this was your fault. - Yes. - No, none of this, you are not to blame. Maybe dad's right, maybe none of us are to blame. Maybe if just you and I quit pointing fingers at each other. It just seems like we're always like fighting or yelling or something and I mean maybe we should just... You know, we're never just able to talk like this. (slow music) - Hello Mrs. Hyde. - Mr. Sanders, how's Wendy. - Oh, she's getting better every day. - I'm so pleased to hear that. I can't tell you. This is everything from Wendy's desk and locker. I kept putting it off until I admitted she wasn't coming back to school this year. - Thank you. - It was terrible what happened to her. We were all just heart sick. - Did you hire him? - Custodial help comes to the district office. - Yeah, but you're the principal, you had to approve him, right? - He passed all the standards we applied to our applicants. There was no way we could have-- - But didn't you check his records? I mean he had two child molestation charges in California. - We only check on a statewide basis and there was no file on him. - So what you're saying is that there could be people like Frank Warden. - That's how it's done Mr. Sanders. It's no excuse but that's how it's done. Wendy is a lovely child and I'll be sorry for what happened to her for the rest of my life. - And she'll make sure this never happens again. - Ready? - No, not yet. - Wendy, you look great. - It's not that, I think I'm scared Is that silly? - No, baby, that's not silly. - It's just that, I mean it's all my friends, people I like, people that like me. I feel different and they're still the same. Do you think they'll still like me? - More. I like you more. Wendy, everybody out there thinks that you are just like the bravest person in the world. You have been so strong for so long and they all just love you and admire you for that. So do I. - Enough to let me borrow your leather jacket? - Yes, enough to let you borrow my leather jacket. - Okay, I'm ready. (somber music) - Good to see you. - Oh, Bill. - Yeah. - We need some more lemonade. - Oh well, just one minute. I'll just (indistinct). - Oh my God, I don't believe it. More letters every day and from places I've never even heard of. Bill, have you given any thought to what might happen to Carol if she's convicted and if she... - Yeah, yeah, I think about it all the time. I think about nothing else. - Me too. - You know it's first degree, she could get life. What'll happen to her? What'll happen to us? (children playing in the background) - I cannot hurt you with my (indistinct). - [Mrs. Warden] You're a murderer Mrs. Sanders and you're going to jail for a long time. (tense music) - Tell us Carol, how did you feel when you heard the charges against Frank Warden were being dropped? - I'll try. Shock at first. Complete shock and disbelief. Everybody knew that he was guilty. - I have to object to that. - Sustained. - Whatever your feelings were, the evidence didn't work out. - Well, I got the impression and I had that impression from Detective Metcalf and the district attorney that they had evidence that there was no doubt about who had raped and beaten my daughter almost to death. And that whoever had done it would be punished for it. So I felt outraged. - Okay. What else did you feel? - The most intense hatred I've ever known. I hated him more than I thought anyone could. It was crippling. - What happened next? - When the judge said that he could go free, I got up and I dropped my purse and that's when I saw it, I saw the gun. And I picked it up and I looked up at him and he was laughing. I saw Frank Warden laughing. - Do you usually carry a gun? - No, never. It was my husband's. He keeps it for protection. I didn't even like having it in the house. - What were you doing with it? - Someone had called and threatened my daughter's life and I panicked I got the gun and I put it into my purse. - You told police of this threatening call. Did they take the threat seriously? - They took it seriously enough to put a policeman outside Wendy's room. - Okay. You were in the courtroom, you saw the gun, then what happened? - Something snapped in me. I lost control. It was like I was watching myself from the outside, looking at myself and not being in the middle of it. I'm sorry (indistinct). (sobbing) My lovely, lovely daughter. - When you reached for the gun in your purse, did you intend to kill Frank Warden? - No, I didn't intend anything. It was like my system was overloaded and I was being pushed to a place I had never been before. I know that might be hard to understand. - No, I think that many of us could begin to understand that. Carol, did you plan to kill Frank Warden that day in court? - No, I did not. - At the time you shot Frank Warden, did you know who you were? - I don't understand. - Well, you are Carol Sanders yes and you've always been Carol Sanders. So on that day did you think you were someone else? - No, I did not. So you were fully aware of who you were the whole time, correct? - Yes that's correct. - And did you know where you were then? - Yes, I did. - Did you know who Frank Warden was? You didn't forget his identity, did you? - I knew only too well who Frank Warden was. - You pulled a gun from your purse, you put your finger on the trigger, aimed it at Frank Warden and shot him dead. - Is there a question your honor because this is all in video, it's not disputed. - Question, at the second you pulled the trigger, did you want Frank Warden to be dead? - At that very second, I guess I must have wanted him dead. But I didn't plan it, it just happened. (slow somber music) (indistinct) - Everything, that's all of it. I'm supposed to be the father, I'm supposed to be there to protect her and you and I didn't, I wasn't there. I wasn't there for any of you. I let you down. - You didn't let us down. You did everything you could. There's nothing more you could have done. - (indistinct) we could've survived. (piano music) - Detective Metcalf, who brought the charges against Frank Warden? - Assistant DA Post. - Did Mr. Post believe he had sufficient evidence for a conviction? - He said it would be a slam dunk. - But it wasn't, was it? - But it should have been. Case unraveled. I never had a case that was quite like it. No, that was anything like it. We should have followed procedures a little more closely, especially regarding the evidence. - What did you wanna do? - I don't understand. - You were convinced he was guilty but he was going to walk away from it. Did you have any reaction to that? - I wanted to kill him. I'm a father. For just a second, I was thinking. Well, I wasn't thinking, I was so angry and so frustrated and I'd worked so hard. I guess I went a little crazy for a second. - Insane, just temporarily. - Yes. (dramatic music) - Tell us how this happened, Dr. Green. - She suffered two severe shocks. Once when the charges against Frank Warden were dropped, the second time when she felt the gun in her hand. She lost all touch with reality in what's known as a dissociative state. She felt nothing, heard nothing, saw nothing. She just reacted. There was no way she could have stopped herself. - The defense asks you to believe that a woman with a normal childhood and no history of mental problems forgot she had a loaded gun in her purse. And they want you to believe that she was insane for only a minute and isn't held accountable for her actions during it. A minute by the way in which she did something she now admits she very badly wanted to do, kill a man she hated with every fiber of her being. I think that's just too much to ask you to believe. The answer that deserves is a verdict of guilty in the first degree. Now there's one more issue here needs to be addressed, justification. The crime committed against Mrs. Sanders daughter is the kind of thing that stirs up vengeful emotions in most of us. It makes us wanna get up and go set things right, doesn't it? But we can't work that way. We have laws, we have police. We have courts. When we feel justified in enforcing the law for ourselves, well, chaos is right around the corner for all of us. - Last night saying good night to my son, I thought about how I would react if someone hurt him in a brutal, degrading, painful way and how I'd feel if that person was somehow let go. Given the sudden opportunity to right that wrong, would I be able to control myself. I know it's possible for a mother who loves her child as much as I love mine and as much as carol loves hers to lose control. Carol finally ran out of control. She'd been using all her strength to hang on. And on that day in this courtroom, she simply ran out of control. She's a woman whose heart was torn apart by a violent, senseless act. What she did was neither planned nor premeditated. I know you know that and you understand that. And I'm asking you to acquit her by reason of temporary insanity. (dramatic music) - All rise. You may be seated. Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have your honor. - [Judge] What is the verdict? - We find the defendant guilty of manslaughter. (suspenseful music) - Mrs. Sanders, please stand. The verdict of this jury now becomes the judgment of this court. I pronounce you guilty of the crime of manslaughter. Order, order. I'm setting a sentencing hearing for two weeks from today. - The penalty for manslaughter is less severe. - I can't wait, I've gotta know right now. - Your honor, may I confer with my client before you dismiss the court? - Ms. Wells, this is highly unusual. - Please, your honor. - Very well. - We're exhausted, we can't spend two weeks waiting. We have to move on, we have to keep going. - Your honor, my client seeks closure to this. Her emotional journey over the last few months as we've revealed in this trial has been incredible. - What are you requesting? - Mrs. Sanders is ready to hear her sentencing as soon as possible. - Granted. Pending no objection from the prosecutor, tomorrow then at 10:00 a.m. I'll review my notes and hand down the sentence. - Thank you, your honor. - [Judge] All rise. - The judge wrote sentencing patterns. You're gonna draw five years more than likely. You could be paroled in three and a half years and I'm not done. I'm filing an appeal and I'm going for a sentence reduction as soon as possible. - But I mean, she's going to jail tomorrow, right. - I'm so sorry. (dramatic music) - I'm scared. - I know. I think that's permissible. Listen, whatever happens, you've already been through the worst. Now you and I know that we're watching Wendy go through this is the worst thing that can ever happen. She's gonna be fine. So are you. - I love you so much. (somber music) - Your honor the state requests the maximum sentence, 10 years in prison. - Ms. Wells, anything? - Thank you. I would ask please that you remember the tragedy my client has endured, all she's had to go through, and especially the fact that her daughter's recovery, though significant so far is incomplete. And that Mrs. Sanders has been integral to it. - Does anyone else have anything to say about this matter before the court renders it's decision? - I do, your honor. - [Judge] Who spoke? - Ms. Warden. I would like to say something. - Come forward Ms. Warden. - It's important for me to say this. I don't know what it means to you, your honor. I mean you're going to do what you've decided, but I want you to know how I feel. - Go on Ms. Warden. - I loved my son, he was my only child, all I lived for. But things didn't work out for him. I did what I could but he always had trouble or he got into trouble. I lied to you. I had to, he's my child. But I didn't think that it would lead to Frank getting let go. I thought you'd all prove what he'd done and he'd be punished. But I wasn't going to help you to do it, I'm his mother. But he did do it and I'm so ashamed. I mean that... This beautiful little girl, she suffered so much and she'll keep on suffering. He didn't tell me but I knew because I knew him so well. Your honor, if you send her to jail, it won't bring back my son. It won't make what he did to her daughter go away, it won't erase the terrible ugly thing that he did. It won't do anything except make our misery last longer, Wendy's, hers and mine. - Thank you Mrs. Warden. I'm ready to hand down my decision now. The beauty of our legal system is overall that it works all on its own. If we perceive that it is not working, we do not have the right to take our own corrective measures, especially violent ones. If we do that, we will not have a just society. Mrs. Sanders, for the crime you have been convicted of, manslaughter, I had originally intended a sentence of six years. Now, as this is unlike any case I've ever had and after long long consideration and owing to the many tragic and extenuating circumstances, I'm reducing that sentence to three years. With good behavior, that sentence is reducible to 24 months. And I'm allowing weekend visitations with your family so that you may begin the healing process. It's been long overdue. This court is adjourned. - [Man] All rise. (slow piano music) (ethereal music)
