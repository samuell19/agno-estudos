What do you think? I like green. "He wanted to cry. He wanted to give himself up to despair. And when he came to, he found himself stretched out on the bed and the fairy was sitting next to him. Tomorrow, your wish will come true, the fairy said. What is it, Pinocchio replied? Tomorrow, you'll cease to be a puppet. You're going to become a real boy. Pinocchio was beside himself with joy. But it wasn't meant to be. The next day, he fell down on all fours and began running and jumping around the room. His arms turned into legs. His face became a snout. His back covered with long, gray hairs. The most horrible moment was the one in which he felt his tail appear. And overcome with shame and grief, he began to cry. But what's done can't be undone." Dylan! Dylan? You okay? I thought I heard something fall. I'm fine. Okay. Food's ready. Dad? Yeah? Do you think mom would have stayed if I wasn't... different? You listen to me, hmm? When we start thinking about the things we're missing, we forget about the things we have. You're perfect just the way you are. Never forget that. Okay? All right. Let's eat. I'm hoping your grandparents will be able to come down for the holidays. Won't that be nice? It's pretty good. Have you tried it? Dylan, what's wrong? Did the guy that used to live here really die here? Yes, but he was very old, all right? You don't have to worry about it. Not for a long time. Oh, how'd that happen? Oh no, the tiger awaits. He awakes! Oh, got it. All right, come on, eat, eat. You've got to eat something, all right? Okay. You sure you're going to be okay without me? I can always pick up a double another night. Oh. The number for the pager is on the fridge, okay? If you need me, just call. Keys, keys, keys. Oh. Don't forget to take a shower before bed. I'll be home before you get up. And, uh, hey, tune in around 9:30. I've got a surprise for you. Love you. "At the start of the final hour of the day, set a candle aflame. Place three drops of fresh blood onto the melting wax. Face your reflection, speak these words, and make your wish known. Spirit of fire, let the wheel of fortune turn. Grant me my desire. Should your strength of will survive until the stroke of midnight, extinguish the flame and the djinn will Grant your heart's desire. But beware the djinn's toll. For the gift that you seek may cost your soul. Artifacts required: One clock, one candle, one mirror." Breaking now. Authorities have confirmed the identity of convict Norman Daniels after he was killed in a hit and run late last night. The authorities report that the 31 -year-old escaped a maximum-security detention center. You're listening to soft rock on wjicfmâ€”100. I'm Michael Jacobs and I'll be taking requests through the witching hour all night long. This next one is for a special little man in Burbank. Dylan, if you're listening, this one is for you. Spirit of fire... Let the wheel of fortune turn... Grant me my desire. I wish I had a voice... I wish I had a voice... I wish I had... A voice. I am the atomic comet robot. Please give my best wishes to everybody. I am the atomic comet robot. Please give my best wishes to everybody. I am the atomic comet robot. Please give my best wishes to everybody. I am... "At the start of the final hour of the day, set a candle aflame. Extinguish the flame and the djinn will Grant your heart's desire. But beware the djinn's toll, for the gift that you seek may cost your soul." "Part man and part beast in nature, the djinn is one of the five immortal guardians of the shadow realm. Appearing to those who conjure the wish of desire, the djinn will Grant one wish to anyone brave enough to survive an hour in his presence. But it will consume the heart of all those who fail, damning their soul to the shadow realm for all eternity. Assuming the form of the dead, the djinn will often Grant wishes in such a way as to thwart the desires of the summoner, their fulfillment frequently leading to unintended consequences. Although immortal, the djinn is susceptible to the laws of men when in the human realm, able to regenerate only upon return to its world. It may only be banished if the flame is extinguished after the stroke of midnight." I am the atomic comet robot. Dylan, wait. Please don't make me leave you again. Mom? Could I have stopped it? Hey bud, what are you doing up so early? What? I love you, dad. I love you, too. You know what? Why don't you go get changed and I'll make you some breakfast, huh? Go on. You know what? We should... We should go to the park and play some football, later. Maybe get some ice cream? What? "Survive until the stroke of midnight. Then the djinn will Grant your heart's desire." Do you think mom would have stayed if I wasn't... different? I wish I had a voice... Could I have stopped it? "The djinn will often Grant wishes in such a way as to thwart the desires of the summoner, their fulfillment frequently leading to unintended consequences." When we start thinking about the things we're missing, we forget about the things we have. I wish... "Overcome with shame and grief, he began to cry. But what's done..." "Can't be undone." A voice. Dad? Dad! Look at me. Dad! Look at me. No, no, no! Please! I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, no! No, I take it back. I take it all back. I didn't mean to.
