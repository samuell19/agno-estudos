Dear Korina, I know you are listening. Korina, I'm sorry if I had to say this to Roni, this is the only way I know how to reach out to you. Korina, I'm really sorry, I know that I have taken you for granted. So many times you try to tell me that you're trying to understand, and so many times it's me who fails to understand. Maybe it's because I always thought that whatever happens, you'll always be there for me. I didn't realize that one day, you will say goodbye and mean it. Now I realize my mistake, and even if I know that it's close to impossible that you will come back to me, I want you to know that I miss you. I am so sorry that I hurt you, but I think I should let you know that I still love you, and now that you're no longer with me. - I realized that... - Hello? Marian, what are you doing? Love Mr. Blue, from San Antonio Village, Makati. ♪ I want her to know That I love her ♪ ♪ That was my only dream ♪ - Are you ready, boss? - Okay. Hi. - You're early. - There's more stuff. Hey, Veronica, visit us at our new place. It's near the university. Sure. You two take care, especially you with that. You too. I'll miss the noise your typewriter makes. I'm sure. But I have to go. I'm going to be late. Don't forget to call me or come visit. - Okay. Thanks again, Veronica. - Yes. I'll just leave the keys with Mr. Palacios. - I'll take care of it. - Are you sure? Okay, bye! - Take care. - Bye! Come and visit us soon. We'll just go bowling. But I don't know how. My gosh! How will you learn if you don't even try? You'll just get annoyed with me. But what else will you do? Stay home and watch TV? I'm in the middle of a book. Oh, my gosh, you're surrounded by books all day. Then you'll read again when you get home? Please come and play bowling with Meldy and I. Maybe next time. - Come on, you promised. - I never promised you anything. Willie will talk to your mother. She'll just talk to Aunt Ched. Give me a break. She's the one who wants a date. Don't drag me into this. Come on. They won't allow me if you're not coming. You should've beaten him up. Babe, give it to me. - Hi. - Hi. Here. Wow, why is this so thick? How many pages are there? - Twelve. - Twelve? The professor might not believe that I did this myself. Okay, I have to go. You're welcome. Thank you. It's stated there when you have to start with your practicum. The schedule has been arranged according to your request. Why was I assigned in Ortigas? How many hours is your practicum? - One hundred twenty hours. - Can you finish that? It's a requirement. What can I do? Hey, your eyes, your contact lens might come off. You keep staring at the boys. Have you seen Eugene Buenaventura's girl? He's so handsome, but his girlfriend looks like a laundrywoman. Aunt, it's like this, the whole gang is going out. And we'll just... Go to a disco. Of course, with the boys. But I assure you these boys are nice. They're from Ateneo. Just a second. Willie, hold on... Oh, my! Diosa, what's the matter with you? Separate all the ones with yam. They have to be in order. Don't put all the boxes together. You're so annoying. Willie, where were we? Hey, Diosa! Come on! You're being difficult! I told you to separate the ones with the pastries. Its part of an order. Mrs. Paredes is picking that up later this afternoon. Do you understand? You're so difficult! What are you smiling at? Go check the oven. Our house might burn down. All you do is say yes. Yes, Willie, Ateneo... what about Ateneo? - What did my mother say? - Mission accomplished. Get dolled up and make yourself pretty. I don't want to disappoint Ronald. I had to give Elaine a present just to be able to set up this date. - Meldy, card. - Thank you. Read the card. Ah, Veronica, you know Professor Boni Aguas, from the Physics Department. How could I forget? Every time he comes here, you introduce him to me. - Oh, so you know each other. - Of course. How embarrassing for me. Sorry. Sorry. - Hey! - What? Veronica, phone call. A boy. After eight? No I can't make it. How about Saturday, around four? I'm not free in the morning. After four is much better. Okay, good. So I don't have to give you the address anymore? Okay, thank you, Mr. Montinola. Mr. Montinola, thank you. Bye. Why are you looking at me that way? - Ooh, she has a date! - What date? I posted my apartment in the classified ads. Someone's interested in renting it. - Is he single? - I don't know. As long as he has money to pay for the rent, I wouldn't care if he has three wives. You're such a fool! She found out! Don't tell me you regret going on a date with Shirley. No, I was even defensive. That's right. Don't ever admit anything. Yeah, that's right. In the end, she even apologized for what I said about her not trusting me. See? Right! That's my man! Right! Thank you, man! Take care! - Four o'clock tomorrow. - See you! Bye. Thank you, man. Come here. What's your problem? You've been very quiet. What am I supposed to say? All you talk about with your friends is crap! Do you have your period? Why are you so touchy? You know I wonder what you say to Gerry and Wally behind my back. I mean, gosh, you know, the way you talk about your women! It's too much! That's bad. I don't like it when you act so insecure. Marian, who are you really going out with? Friends of Willie. Where are you going? I don't know. Willie planned it. I don't trust your friend. She's so young to be such a flirt! Wait. Who's picking you up? Didn't Willie's mother leave her family to elope with this stranger... an Australian? Why do you have to bring up Willie's mom right now? Of course, like mother, like daughter, right? Lelang, there's someone at the door. Wait, it must be Patrick. I don't think Mylene is ready. Mylene! Hurry up, your date is here! Mylene! - Patrick, have something to eat. - I have eaten. I'll just meet some people with Mylene. Did you set up your car's sound system? Come, you wanna look? - Let's go. - Daddy! Daddy! Look at Mylene. What? Aren't you going to catch a cold? Daddy, please. Daddy, isn't she beautiful? Love Thoughts, Love Lines. Hi! This is Roni Night, inviting you to spend this evening with me. Our first letter is from Willie of Parañaque, to Ronald of Ateneo. Hi, Ronald. I don't know how you're going to react to this letter. But I have met you about twice before. I am sure you remember me. And I am now so excited because finally we will get to know each other better. That's why I can't wait for Saturday. When we will go out and discover each other. Ronald, I know that you can be special to me and I can... If we open our hearts and give each other a chance. So here's with a hope that we will have a beautiful date which may be the beginning of something great. Love, Willie, to Ronald of Ateneo. - Hello? - Marian! They're playing my song! Did you hear it? Oh my... - Ms. Fernandez? - Yeah? Please follow me. It's kind of chaotic today. There's a presentation. It's a battle zone inside. But the marketing team where you were assigned is here. You should meet Mr. Molina. - Who's Mr. Molina? - Your new boss. Cut! Cut! Cut! There is something wrong. It's a little thin. What do you mean? Look, we identified our market already as young adults, you know, until thirty. Frankly, I think it's a teenybopper. Didn't we just discuss that it's for the youth? You must have noticed that the campaign is quite mature. We can still change it, right, Jed? What is it that you want really? It shouldn't be cute. What if we inject a little sex in the concept? Oh! I like that, sex. There's sensuality. Angel, this is a body shampoo, not a lubricant. Ma'am, the intern is here. Maybe Jed should see the visuals so he can appreciate the jingle. - Ma'am? - Yes? It's Miss Fernandez, the intern. Good morning. - What's your name? - Babsy Fernandez. Babsy, can you please make us coffee? - Who wants coffee? - I don't like cream. Just sugar. One and a half teaspoon. Me too. Okay, who else wants coffee? Raise your hands! I think she's responsible. Look who's coming! Raffy, why are you late? Raffy? What meeting? Have you made progress? Well, we're still making comments on the jingle that was made. - Uh, Raffy, you like coffee? - Sure. Can I have one, please? Hey, can you make one more coffee? Wait, it really sucks. Listen to it. Why are you so serious about that practicum? I want to graduate, of course. And you, are you taking care of your assignments? I'll make arrangements. I don't want to look stupid being a slave to those executives. Are you going to have dinner here? Yes. Zeny, I need to ask you something. I've been calling for hours. Why was the phone line busy? - I don't know. - "I don't know." You're always talking to the drivers of the neighbors. - That's not true. - "That's not true." I've been calling to ask what time I should pick her up, but I couldn't get through. Hey, Zeny, stop pestering Mrs. Poblador's driver. - She's called my attention. - But that's not true. Come on! You know what, babe, I wouldn't be surprised if your maid gets pregnant. She's just at home, but she's wearing makeup. When are you taking care of your practicum? Are you planning to graduate this March or are you planning to wallow in school? Don't worry, babe. I'm doing my practicum at my father's office. The coach will talk to the dean. I don't have to waste 120 hours. Besides, I'm working there after I graduate. And also, we're getting married after we graduate. You wouldn't have to work. I don't know why you have to work hard on that assignment. - Lester, please! - What? - Yes? - Jed Montinola. I believe we have an appointment? Seven thousand five hundred pesos. Two months advance, one month deposit. The rent is quite high. Others would charge you 10,000 pesos. Is it quiet here? I want peace and quiet when I have to work. It's quiet here. I also prefer silence when I'm working. Ah, are you married? - Do I look like I'm married? - Sorry. How would I know what a single or a married guy looks like? I'm very much single. I'm not that crazy yet to get married. Good for you. - Veronica? - Oh! - Grandma Viring. - I brought some kaldereta. I cooked this for you yesterday. I know it's your favorite. Thank you. By the way, this is Mr. Montinola, he's checking out the apartment. And she is... And she is Mrs. Palacios, she'll be your new neighbor if ever. Really? - This is fine. - What? I said this is fine. I can issue you a check for the advance and the down. Isn't it delicious? Taste this. I'm trying it out on the market. It's pastry with sweet coconut filling. This is different, that one has yam filling. This is coconut. Yam is my best-seller. Mother, that's enough. Patrick is having a hard time. You're forcing him. But he thinks it's delicious. How can we have dinner if you're feeding him all your pastries? Ooh... Daddy's coming. Daddy sit down. Patrick, drink some. That's not so filling. Here's some beer. Daddy, Patrick doesn't drink beer. Is it good? Where is Willie? Daddy... Daddy, look at our baby. You're going out on a date in that? Come on. Didn't you wear that to your first communion? Hi, Auntie! Hi, Uncle! Are you ready, Marian? - Let's go. - Bye. - Let's go. Come here. - Marian, wait. Marian, wait. Hey! Oh my gosh! ♪ The future is for the young ♪ ♪ It's for the whole world Don't just let it go ♪ Yes! For the youth! - I'm sleepy. - It's too early. - Didn't you take your vitamins? - I didn't get enough sleep. I did Lester's term paper in Literature. Is your boyfriend illiterate or something? Maybe he graduated without learning how to read and write. - Oh, my God. Babsy, look. - What? Take a look, not too obvious though. Yeah. Really? I like that. Is that Eugene's girlfriend? Admit it, it's unfair. With that face, why did he go for a... ♪ Aren't you going to notice ♪ ♪ Will I just love From a distance ♪ ♪ We hardly see each other ♪ - You know what? - What? You should see Alex's car. No. Mine is a Porsche. My dad owns the Testarossa. Really? You drive a Porsche? Marian, did you hear that? He drives a Porsche. Yes, I heard it, loud and clear! Your outfit is cool. It's unique. Marian is just a little anti-fashion. What does anti-fashion mean? She's not into clothes. She likes computers! Wow, computers, intelligent. Doesn't that make you blind? - Where are you going? - I'm suffocating in here. - Yes, it's so hot in here! - I know. No, there's too much air. - Hi! - Hi. - How are you? - Okay, and you? Cool, cool. I'm fine. I'm okay. And how is... Well, we've broken up. You broke up? Well, that's bad. No, that's good. - Uh... - Yeah, that's good. Too many girls in there, it's like a sauna bath. - Pink, this is... - Lizbeth. - Hi, Lizbeth. - This is Pink. Hi. Too many people here. - Ah, Eugene. Nice seeing you. - Sure. Nice meeting you, I'll go ahead. Oh, shit! - Are you okay, man? - I'm okay. Tissue! No, I'm fine. Tissue! What took you so long? I bumped into someone. The drink spilled on him. I was embarrassed, I looked stupid. You look that way anyway. You think you're handsome? You look like a pig! Do you want me to spell that to you? Waiter! Waiter! One more round, please! More drinks? Marian, what would you like to drink? Poison, if there's any. Aren't we going home? Good morning! Monching, what are you doing? What do you think? I'm watering the plants. They're going to die if I don't. - Get inside. - What do you think I was doing? I said get inside! This old woman sure has crazy ideas! Hm! Why was it rejected? I didn't understand Collantes. He approved the first concept. It even went to sales, everything went well. What did Raffy say? He's still in a conference with Collantes. I think he wants to commit suicide. Babsy, please follow-up with the advertising agency we called. Please overhaul our marketing plans, okay? I'll just finish this. If Collantes wasn't a woman, I'd beat her up. Who told you she's a woman? With that thick moustache? What was wrong? Even she doesn't know what was wrong. The problem is she doesn't even know the questions. She expects me to provide her the answers. So what was lacking in the campaign? - She said it has no heart. - Whatever that means. Look, we're promoting a body shampoo and not baby shampoo. I mean, not even baby powder. So why do we need heart for a body shampoo? Maybe the problem is too much emphasis was given on sex. I mean, it's like the campaign strategy says that you are using body shampoo for sexual attraction. Uh... It loses its practicality for regular female buyers, like mothers. I'll just get the puncher. Babsy? Sir, about what happened earlier, - I'm really really sorry. - Wait. No, sir, I was too presumptuous to think that... I'm really really sorry. I was just practicing. I have no right to... Can you please make me finish before you make a speech? I think you're right. Maybe that's the point of Mrs. Collantes, that's why she didn't like the campaign. There's too much emphasis on sex. Which means women like Mrs. Collantes, the product will not identify to, because she is 47 years old and a Born Again Christian. I mean... Thank you, thank you for your suggestion. Are you alright? We have to talk some other time. Of course, sir. Babes! - I have to go. - We'll talk. They were trying to be nice to you but you had to call his cousin a pig. Willie, they are not nice. You can call them anything, but not nice. Know what, Marian, the problem is that you're so anti-social. People will say that before you turn 20, you're going to be menopausal because you have an attitude problem. Attitude problem? Who has an attitude problem between us? Who had a drinking spree and got so drunk in front of your Atenean friends? I didn't get drunk. I was just a little tipsy. Know what, it is useless talking to you, so I will not call you later. Dude... - My God. - I'm sorry. - Watch where you're going. - No, it's fine. Oh, no, it's you again. Because you're always getting in my way. - You know her? - Yes. We met. - I'm sorry. - Bye! Miss? Miss? You're with Love Thoughts, Love Lines, and I am Roni Night, keeping you company for the next three hours. I have a very difficult letter here. Because, well, this letter is addressed to me. And the letter sender is someone who prefers to be called Andy. His letter reads, "Dear Roni... I listen to your voice every night. I listen to your music. Although we've never met, I feel that I know you. Sometimes, it's enough that you hear someone's voice to know that you can connect. Is it weird? I know that if we have the chance to meet, something special may happen. You'll never know... What are you listening to? I will wait for the day, but until then, you can be reassured that someone out there is very happy to hear your voice. Love, Andy." Well, Andy, I know you are listening. And your message is loud and clear. I'm happy when I know I can give happiness. And what can I say? Maybe a better answer would be this song. Andy, this is only for you. ♪ There's a special love inside my heart and mind ♪ Hello? Good evening. Marian, please? - Yes, who's this? - This is Gary. You know, the guy you almost killed earlier. Uh, yes? Why do you have my phone number and my name? Well, I accidentally got your organizer mixed with my things. Your name, phone number, and address was there. I want to return it to you. You might need this. - Like when? - Like tonight. No, like right now. I'm calling you from my car. I'm parked outside your house. What? Well, if you can come down for a minute, so you can get your organizer. Are you alright? Wait a while. Just give me a few seconds, okay? I'll just... Well... - Hi! - Ta-da! Here's your organizer. Thank you. I'm sorry, I mean you had to bring this all the way here. - I don't mean to be a bother. - No, it's okay. I drove my friend home anyway. He just lives around here. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Um... Perhaps you want to come in for a while? But you may be tired, whatever. Well, I'll just ask for a glass of water if that's okay. So, you want to go in? Um, well, you can bring the water outside. - I think you'd better come in. - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Come. - Okay. That's mineral water, but the ice is from the faucet. But they say that when the water freezes, - the bacteria dies anyway. - Yeah. Your family? Yeah, that's my Mom, Dad, brother, and sister. The usual. - Whose medals are those? - Mine. Why are you embarrassed? What? I just find it so tacky. Actually, it was my mother who insisted to have those framed. Every time there are visitors, she would give them a brief history of those medals. As if they were interested. You know what, medals are also framed at my house. But those are my brother's, and not mine. Well, my brother doesn't have medals. He almost got kicked out of school. You're talking to someone? Who is he? - Mom, this is Gary. - Good evening. Oh, my! I didn't know we had a visitor. - I'm sorry about my appearance. - It's okay. Daddy! Daddy, hurry! We have a visitor. - A guy! - What? Who is it? Daddy, meet our baby's friend... - What's your name again? - It's Gary. I didn't realize a visitor came. I just returned Marian's organizer. I got it by mistake. - Where did you meet? - Dad, in school. In school. I'm sorry about all this. All our maids sleep early because they have to be up to fill all the water tanks in the morning. Water supply comes at 5:00 in the morning. It's alright. Mom, Dad, we're okay. Marian, you didn't even serve food to your visitor. We're okay, Mom. Have you tried a special pastry? A special pastry? Yes, there's yam and coconut. I made it. You know what, I thought they were going to kick me out. You know, gosh, I really don't know what got into me. But I've been wanting to express my opinion for a long time now. I felt it was pointless since I was so insignificant. But you know, when Mr. Balmaceda talked to me, I felt like I had something to contribute. Why did I even study if I couldn't use it at all? Hey! I've been blabbering here, but it seems your mind is in another planet. Sorry, Babsy. I discovered something earlier. What gossip have you heard this time? Babsy, Eugene broke up with his girlfriend who looked like a maid. So what? Did I tell you that a fortune-teller said that I am going to meet my soulmate this year? But that jerk is not even giving you the time of day. What makes you think that he's your soulmate? Um... He doesn't know it yet, he hasn't gotten the chance. In! Let's have one more game! What do you mean one more game? I'm so sleepy, Lester. Babe, one more, please. Hey! It was nice meeting you. I hope to see you soon. - Bye. - Good night. - Drive safely. - Yes, sir. - Sorry, I'm really really sorry. - About what? Come on! They're sweet. Imagine? Your mother even gave me some pastries to take home. No, she's just giving those away because no one buys her pastries. Oh... So, can I see you tomorrow? Okay. - What time is your last class? - 3:30. Good. Mine ends at 2:00. - Meet you in the parking lot? - Okay. Good night. - Bye. - Bye. He drives fast. What's his last name? Is that his car? Which village does he live in? Marian, I'm talking to you. Don't turn your back on me. Marian! Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! What? About the noise, we agreed there wouldn't be noise. Noise? That's not noise, it's music. I'm composing music. Oh... Music? Well, maybe when the song is finished, you can call it music. But while you're still working on it, it's just noise. And your typewriter? - What about my typewriter? - It makes noise too. Oh. Well, it's not as noisy as your synthesizer when you're playing it. Jed, what's wrong? Nothing, my music is noisy. Please, I don't know what you can do. Just turn the volume down. Our neighbors are old. They can't stay up late. Good night. - What's your landlady's problem? - She's an aging virgin. Your mood swings are getting worse. You're ruining my night. What night? It's one in the morning. Why are you so irritable? I've wanted to go home for hours. But you had to play billiards first. I've been so sleepy. Come on. But you and Lizbeth were talking, weren't you? You know what, good night. This conversation isn't going anywhere. It's ma'am. - Good evening. - What is that boy doing here? You really want to know what they were doing? No. Marlon just returned the songbook he borrowed from me. It's one in the morning and he had to return the songbook now? Get inside! You... I'll go ahead. Babe... Hey! Did she say yes? No, she said she has stuff to finish. - I don't like watching movies. - Veronica, please come with us. Loy and Boni are coming, - as well as... What's his name? - My gosh, Martin. Ah, the movie stuntman. No, he's old news. He's now the reporter's guy. I have a new one, he works in a gin factory. Veronica, where do you go at night? I was calling last night, around 9:30. - No one was answering. - I went out. I got pissed at my tenant. He's so noisy and he's arrogant. I'm getting suspicious. I'm beginning to realize that you are keeping a lot of secrets. Hm. Everyone has secrets. You should be thankful because even if you called him a pig, he still wants to go out with you. So now I owe him? No matter what you say, Willie, he looks like a pig. Come on, Marian. Ronald is dying to go out with Willie, so you have to come. Why don't you go? Marian, you're early. Don't you have a class? My history professor was absent. He had an asthma attack. - So you're free? Let's go? - Let's go. Hello? Maybe you'd want to introduce us. Hi. That's Willie and Tootsie. - Hello! - Hi! Bye! Nice meeting you. Bye! Mm-hm... - Really? You like computers too? - My sister thinks it's weird. - Are you using 486 or Pentium? - Gosh, just the 486. Wow, do you have sound blasters? How much memory do you have? Mine has 32 KB on board. My gosh. Mine is complete. One gig. I have a scanner too. What's your printer? Why are we talking about this? You're the only girl I know who can talk computers. You should see my brother's setup. It's really something. My brother is really special. My father demands that I become as good, if not better, than my brother Ricky. - What does your mom say? - Hmm... My mom has been dead for ten years. She used to be on my side. You're lucky you had your mother on your side then. I have no one on my side. No one's better than my sister Mylene. They only notice me whenever they see how different I am from her. - Now you're laughing at me. - No. I felt the same way about my brother Ricky before. Not anymore? Nothing's wrong with being competitive, right? But what's the point of having to compare yourself to others all the time? When you think about it, you can do a lot of things that your sister can't. You're just saying that because you haven't met my sister. Does she know anything about computers? Can she install programs? Are you kidding? One time she did some ironing, she almost got electrocuted. You see? No problem. - You want more? - No, thanks. Are you sure? Okay. I'll have all of this. You want? Dear Roni, even though we haven't met, I still feel that I already know you. Nowadays, you can meet a lot of people but you can only really know a few. In a world full of names and faces, there are only very few people... and even if I haven't seen you, I believe that with your words, I know you more than all the other women who come and go in my life. Roni, are we going to take a chance in seeing another side of ourselves or are we going to let destiny take its own course? Love, Andy. Well, Andy, I am very happy to receive another one of your letters. I must admit that after reading so many love messages, I anticipate the times when you send your letters for me. But whatever will be, will be. I've always believed that if things were meant to be, events will take their own course. Do I also want to meet you? Maybe. How do I feel about your letters? Well, I will express my feelings the way I noticed. Andy again... This is for you, and only for you. ♪ You hold me, You take me in your arms ♪ ♪ And all at once I'm in another world ♪ ♪ Like no other world I've known ♪ Hello. Willie, please. Hello, Marian? - Gary? - Hi. I'm sorry, I thought it was Willie. Did you enjoy yourself? Yeah, very much. Very, very much. Hey! Come out from there! Hey come out from there! Come on! - Hey! - What? Why did you... Why is there no water left in the tank? I'm going to work. I have to take a bath. When I opened the faucet, there's no water supply. How can I take a bath? You woke me up because you couldn't bathe? What do you want me to do? Fetch you some water? Don't get sarcastic on me. We're the only ones who use the water in the tank. It contains 500 gallons. Why is there none left? Because normal people do bathe. Are you a duck or a fish? You consumed 500 gallons? And look at this! - Come and take a look. - What's your problem? Your car is blocking mine. How will I get out? What do you want me to do? Put your car on my truck? When I arrived last night, that was already parked there because you got home ahead of me. Where should I park my truck? Do something! How will I get out? Wait, I thought you had sensitive ears. Why are you shouting then? Come on! - Oh my, kids these days. - Veronica, is there a problem? A problem? This is my problem. I don't know what I did wrong to have to deal with him! He'll be out by the end of the month! What do you mean “out”? Hey, I paid you! Two months advance, one month deposit. You can't kick me out even if you bring me to any court of law. Hey! I own the place where you live in! Why can't I kick you out? Veronica, your blood pressure. Guys, I just want to make sure that our material won't look like any other TV commercial for beauty soap or shampoo. Okay? There's a tendency for all TVCs to look one and the same. I think that's not going to be a problem. Aren't we trying too hard? What do you think, Babsy? What? I beg your pardon? The target market is people your age. How do you think women your age will respond to this commercial? Um, I think music will play a big factor. And then the look... That's right, a little more like MTV. It depends on the MTV. Jonathan, who's the director in the lineup? It depends on the production house. The bidding is taking quite long. What? For how many weeks? Babsy, telephone, it's Lester. Tell him I'm busy. - What's the real score, Meldy? - I don't know. You don't know? Every time you're with him, you get greasy all over. Don't tell me you don't know. It should come from Boni. I can't speak up first. I'm the girl. Meldy, get a grip. You have no right to play hard to get. The other night, I was listening to Radio Romance. A girl from Sorsogon sent a letter. She's so in love but she doesn't know if the guy is serious about her. I cried. So you felt you were in the same boat. And why not? I can't make the first move. It's Boni who should propose. I don't want him to think that I'm easy. You're not easy, Meldy. You're a bargain. - What about you, Veronica? - What about me? At your age, you must have fallen in love somehow. That's why I'm behaving, I want a peaceful life. That meant something. It feels good to be in love. But whenever you think about or actually experience problems, you tell yourself, “enough”. You know how painful it gets and then you get traumatized. That's way too much. It's sad being alone. Alone is not necessarily lonely. Life is easier when you only have yourself to worry about. - Hello, ma'am. - Good afternoon. - What's wrong? - Hi. You said you're rich, but you didn't tell me you're this rich. Oh, let's go upstairs. You get impressed too easily. Marian, let's go. I'll take your bag. Those are just fish. - Your brother? - Yeah. - The one in the U.S.? - Yup, I only have one brother. Wow, it's like the control panel of a spaceship. I'll show you my new software. This was sent by my brother. I just installed it on the Power Macintosh. You said yours is one gig, right? Yes. Daddy. What are you doing here? Don't you have classes today? Um, my class ends at 3:00. Dad, this is Marian, my schoolmate. - Hello, sir. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Gary... If you have guests, there are other places in our house to entertain them aside from your room. Dad, I was just showing her my computer. I don't want you bringing girls to your room. Is that the right thing to do? Do you understand? Yes, Dad. I almost had a heart attack. I thought something bad happened to you. I called all your friends. No one could tell me where you were. Wait, let me. Daddy, wait, I'm not finished. I almost called the police. It's because she's always with this Balmaceda. Wait, can I say something? I'm involved here. Do you know that I spoiled two dozens of pastries because I couldn't concentrate on my baking? Marian, we're not scolding you or anything, but what's happening? You didn't even call. You didn't tell us where you were going. You just disappeared from school and then... Why are you so upset? It's the first time I did this. And we're not planning to allow you to make a habit of gallivanting without asking permission! Why are you scolding me? You let my brother and sister get away with it. Hey, I'm a boy. Our situation is different! Your sister was 18 years old when we allowed her to have a boyfriend. Maybe that guy's your boyfriend now. It's none of your business! Daddy, did you hear that, Daddy? Our baby is shouting at us now. How will I go home? I'm done at around nine. The terminal is quite far. I'm sure somebody there has a car. Just hitch a ride. You said you'd pick me up. I know, but I'm busy. Busy? You're just entertaining your monkey friends! Why are you dragging my friends into this? You're letting me commute by myself while you're having fun with your friends? You're acting insecure again! I told you that's bad. I'll get mad at you. Hey, I'm also mad at you. And because I am so mad at you, remember the term paper you have to submit on Tuesday to pass your philosophy class? Well, excuse me, Lester, but you better do it yourself. I won't write a word for you. Give my regards to the monkeys. Don't take it out on the phone. It's helpless. - What's your problem? - It's nothing. You almost crushed the phone. My boyfriend backed out. He was supposed to pick me up. That's it? I'm sorry if I bothered you. Um. I'll be all right. I'll just take you home after we wrap up. - Besides, we're almost done. - Oh. No, no, no, it's okay. I insist, and on the way let's grab a bite or something. I'm so sick of pepperoni pizza. I need a decent meal. So what are your plans after March? - What do you mean? - Do you plan to work? Or finish your graduate studies? - Or go abroad? - Of course, I want to work. But I also want to go to Australia because my whole family is there. I'm the only one here because I'm still studying. But I'm graduating. So you have plans of settling in Australia? No... I can't do that. Your boyfriend, you've already made plans with him. Well, he has plans. He wants us to get married right after graduating. But that's tentative. Just like me and my girlfriend back then. - You have a girlfriend? - Four years ago. Like him, I wanted to get married after graduation. She wanted to go to the U.S. for a vacation. She met somebody over there, now she's married. But, I'm not. I'm sorry to hear about that. There's nothing to be sorry about. It happens all the time. Nothing's set in stone in relationships. People change and people grow up. Hey, you should eat. Your boyfriend might be looking for you. This is Roni Night, on Love Thoughts, Love Lines, in the Philippines most romantic station, Radio Romance. Now, let me read a letter coming from Marian of Parañaque to Gary of Quezon City. "My dearest Gary, I wish I could understand all these new feelings I am now experiencing ever since I met you. I have always imagined how this would feel. I've read about this, I've heard this in love songs, but all of what I know doesn't seem to be enough if I want to capture this feeling in words. You are the first person to make me feel so important. In the simple things that we do, you give so much meaning to my days. When we're together, I feel that we are the only two people in this planet. You may not be aware of this. But in the short amount of time that I have known you, you have become so important to me. I am happy, Gary, but I am also scared. I am scared of these new feelings that give me so much joy and threaten me with so much pain. Please be there for me. Please help me understand, why we are feeling this way for each other. Love, Marian." ♪ Come here ♪ ♪ Let's take this slow ♪ ♪ Slowly ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ - Hello? - Hi, Marian. Marian? - Hi, Gary. - How are you? Go to hell, you bastard! Who do you think you are? The hell with you! You're nothing but a selfish son of a bitch! You think of nothing but yourself. Hey, go see a doctor. Have your brain checked! - You go to hell! - No, you go to hell! No, you go to hell first! I'll see you there! Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. You've changed, you're counting everything. I told you, I need this for my sister's tuition fee. You have excuses now, unlike before... Marlon, please. Fine. I'm leaving. Marlon, you're upset. You've changed. Didn't we make a promise that we'd help each other? Okay, fine. How much money do you need? Anyway, my sister can stop studying and enroll next school year. Zeny, how did this guy get in here? I'm about to leave. He just asked for some water. What did I do now? Nothing. Come here. What? I'm inviting you to enter my kingdom. Are you drunk? I just want someone to talk to, my mouth is drying up. Don't worry. I won't harm you. - You want siopao? - What flavor? Meatball. Give it to me. I'm glad there are no snakes here. That's okay. I've always wanted a pet snake. You got home early. Yeah. Oh. Do you want... Whoops. You want sauce? Why are you alone up there? Where are your parents? Oh, that. Well, my father passed away. My mother is in Toronto. You don't even have a maid? I don't need one. They just give me problems. I'm always out of the house. They might be up to no good. What's so funny? You think they're up to no good. Do you have a boyfriend? I just offered you siopao. Don't get personal. Then don't answer my question. You're not a good sport. I came here to talk to you, to settle things, and not to make a confession. You're so shallow. You laugh even if I'm not cracking a joke. I don't know about you women. You are hard to understand. My friend... I assume you still remember my friend. The fair one who's always here. Well, she walked out a while ago. She was even yelling out there. So you disturbed our old neighbors again. They had a good time watching us. Why are you women like that? Don't worry. We don't understand you men too. You called him up? How did you get Eugene's number? You know me. If I were in the National Bureau of Investigations, more crimes would be solved. What did you tell him? Nothing. You called and didn't say anything? I just listened to his voice and then I hung up. What's wrong with you, Lizbeth? Come on. You're like a pre-teen who just recently had her period. My goodness. Babsy, it's Lester. What's up? How's your old professor? Your teacher in... What subject was it? - I saw you yesterday. - Where? Let's go. I might end up slapping him. Wait a minute. I just want to make peace. Val, come with me. Babe, are you still mad at me? What do you think? - Go away. - Babe, give me a chance. Please, Lester, don't mock me in front of your stupid friends. But I'm apologizing. Whatever. Come on, Lizbeth. - Don't play hard to get. - Can you just shut up? - Will you please leave us alone! - Fine! There! Are you okay? - Are you sure? - Are you okay? Damn you! Don't touch me! I'm okay. Gotcha! - Wait, they might see us. - Come on. - But no one's looking. - Wait a minute. Look. I have a feeling that those two are going steady. - Let's take it slow, okay? - What is it to you? Can you just imagine how their kids would look like? Whatever makes them happy is none of our business. Let's go. Stop meddling. You are the one who wrote the letter that was read on the radio? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed. - I didn't know that you... - No, it's okay. It's okay. Really, it's okay. You have some nerve, Marian. There was a time when I asked for your help with Ronald. Did you help me? You made me look stupid. I had to beg just to make you go with me. Well, now. What are you complaining about, Willie? Didn't you tell me that you and Ronald are doing well? I hate him. I hate Ronald! You hate him? How can you hate him when you're so crazy about that arrogant prick? He thinks I don't know what's going on. Every time I call him up, it's either he's asleep, or taking a bath. And then a few minutes later, he has left the house. I've paged him seven times, but he doesn't respond. I have feelings too and I get the message. - It's about time. - So no, thank you, Marian. By the way, before I forget, you should thank me because I never encouraged you to go for Ronald. There are many boys out there. And besides, a lot of boys use CK1 perfume and Cole Hann shoes. Here's my payment for the rent. Maybe I can come in since I just paid. Be careful, you might choke. Thanks for the check. You got lots of tapes and CDs here, but I've never heard music coming from this place. Well, I don't turn up the volume. I don't want to enjoy music at other people's expense. You're trying to imply something. What are you typing most of the time? Wait, don't touch that. - What is it? A story? - No! Stop it! I really want to entertain you, Jed, but I have to go somewhere. One more question, Veronica. You're a librarian, right? Why do you go out almost every night? - And then... - Know what, Jed, I really appreciate your concern, but it's really none of your business. Good night. Okay. Bye. A letter from a certain lady from Quezon City who calls herself, Miss Confused. To a special someone name Lester. "Dear Lester, I do not have the courage to say this to you in person, maybe it's because I know that you will never take anything I say seriously. We've been together a long time, and in so many ways, you know how much I love you. But you no longer see what is happening to me. Lester, what am I going to do if I fall out of love with you? What if there's somebody else who can open an entirely different world for me? Someone who would treat me the way you used to, until you became so sure of me. Lester, I have a problem and you don't even see it. Help me, please help me. Love, Miss Confused." ♪ Good bye ♪ ♪ My love ♪ ♪ I can't believe I'll say this ♪ ♪ Good bye ♪ - Hello? - Hi, babe. Lester? So you're not mad anymore? Yeah. Babe, my philosophy paper. It's due on Tuesday. Babe, are you there? Dad? Of course you know what time it is. It is a school day and you come home this late. How can you still study? But I'm not sleepy yet. You're neglecting your studies because girls are your priority. What can you say about these grades? But these are fine, Dad. Some went down, But I retained my grade point average. That's not good enough, Gary. That's not good enough to get you into any respectable graduate school if your grades are that low. You understand? Your brother, graduated from the same school, with the same course, but with a magna cum laude. These are not the grades of an intelligent person. Good morning. Who am I riding with to school? Where were you last night? I was with Willie. See, Daddy. And she has the nerve to lie. But I was really with Willie. Please don't embarrass yourself. Patrick and I had dinner last night. We saw Willie with her parents and relatives in the restaurant. I asked her where you were. She went pale. I told you. I'll beat that Balmaceda up. Shut up, all of you. You came home so late. I thought all along you were with Willie. Do you know that she called just to... Mother, that Willie is nothing but a loose woman. Stop it! Stop seeing that boy. You're both too young. You might get pregnant. We're not doing anything wrong. You came home so late. It doesn't mean we're doing anything wrong, Mom. Don't make a fool of us, Marian. If you and your boyfriend are doing things when you go out, it doesn't mean that I'm doing the same thing. Why do you talk that way? What are you trying to imply? I said stop it! We're not doing anything bad! You're the problem here because you're being malicious! Damn you. Daddy. Daddy, I... I can't breathe. - Daddy... - Shut up, all of you! If you're going to behave that way, from now on, you're not allowed to use the telephone. From the house, you can only go to school. After class, you come home. If I have to fetch you or drag you home, so be it. The minute you violate any of these rules, Marian, I will shave all your hair off. He's in a foul mood. Collantes scolded him earlier. Be careful. Yeah? Hi! I'll just have this logbook signed for my practicum form. How many hours do you have left? I think around twelve. So you won't be here for long. When you graduate, and step into the real world, that's the time you realize how important school is to you. That's the funny part. When you're a student, you are so eager to get out. The moment you start working, you wish that you never even left. That's how it really is. Even if you try your very best, you really can't please everybody. Especially here, people will always have comments. Not because everyone does it, it's the right thing. That's true. But as long as you do your best, who gives a damn what other people say or think, right? I mean, it sucks to always have to seek other's approval all your life. What are you doing after work? Well, I have no plans. Well, now you do. Really? Wait, excuse me. Do I have a girlfriend? - That's not our thing! - Exactly! - Of course, none! - See? They're very honest. - I don't have a girlfriend! - He's right! - Please... - Really? Uh. Hello. Good morning, may I please speak with Marian? Oh, Gary, I'm sorry. You cannot talk to Marian. Cut it out! You're both too young to be involved in such foolishness. Please prioritize your studies first. Marian's father is so furious because you sneaked out and came home really late. Oh my goodness, you're still children, okay? Suit yourself. Bye. Oh, there you are. I think your Dad made it clear that your boyfriend is banned. Okay? This is none of your business! Don't crush the pastry! But it's Meldy's birthday. Come with us. We seldom invite you so don't say no. But I'm finishing something at home. You always say that. What are you finishing anyway? Please, Veronica. I am going to be so upset. ♪ I wouldn't keep hoping ♪ ♪ If only I could resist ♪ ♪ I wouldn't come near ♪ - Veronica, eat. - Meldy, you have a smudge. - Have some of that. - Okay. You're so happy. - Don't you want it? - Don't you want some? No. Here are some noodles. Yes! - It's over. - It's finally over. - Thank you very much... - That was cheap. It was. - Come on. Eat. - Sure, in a bit. Starring Aga Muhlach and Lea Salonga. Wait. What is it that you do? He works in a liquor factory. What do you do in a liquor factory? I operate a machine. It places corks on bottles. - Really? You place corks? - Yes... He makes profit out of filling in holes. You're so malicious. - This is my wedding ring. - They look so cute, right? Excuse me. Uh. Maybe we can request our regular customer, - Loy, to sing! - I would love that! I don't want to! - Don't be shy. - For her birthday. Go on. Sing. - Come on. - It's embarrassing. Come on. Don't be shy. Just sing. - Well, okay. - Finally! He even has a lyric sheet. But it's my birthday. I feel tense. Okay. For my first number which I am dedicating to my friends, namely Meldy, - Happy birthday! - The celebrator. It's her birthday! Happy birthday, Meldy! - Yes! And to her friend, Boni. - That's you. To my friend also, Veronica. And most especially, - Who's that? - My special friend ladies and gentlemen, Martin. Hi, dear! This is one of my all-time favorite songs. Music, please.

This is Roni Night, in Manila's romantic capital, Radio Romance. It's been a long time since I got a letter from you. I miss you Andy. After what happened, I realized that it takes maturity for a relationship to work. Maybe I was wrong by believing that I'm the only one with needs. Respect is important. If two people can live without each other, but they choose to be together, that's when a relationship works. That is deep. Do you know the difference between immature love and mature love? What? Immature love says, "I love you because I need you". Mature love says, "I need you because I love you". Erich Fromm. - Let's dance? - What? Here, now. Come on. Everyone is allowed to do stupid and silly stuff once in a while. I'm not sure, Raffy. Come on.

It's cool out here. What are you typing up there? - You're meddlesome. - I'm just curious. I'm writing short stories. Look at that. How many stories have you had published? Why would I publish those? Why would you write then if you don't let people read your stuff? It's therapeutic for me. It's how I express myself. All your frustrations and things you cannot vent out. That's how I am with my music. I'm really a composer, not just a creator of commercial jingles. It's just a racket. It's hard being alone. It's good but hard at the same time. You don't have a family? Now you're being personal. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. I have a family. My parents live in Sta. Rosa, La gun a. That's far. Besides, they don't understand what I do. That's why I prefer to live on my own. Now it's my turn to ask. Are you really like that? You seem disgusted. I didn't say I'm disgusted. I mean, are you really... I can't believe it. Girls like your type... I'm sure... You're sure that? I'm sure you're a little crazy too. Of course. Um. I have another side. There's another person inside me that I don't reveal to people. Those who think they know me get surprised. That's how people are. It just depends on how you carry yourself, and how much of yourself you show to people. Why do you have to hide? I learned my lesson. Once, I revealed myself completely to one person, but he left me. He hurt me. Ever since, I told myself... And then? I'm sleepy. Then? Maybe you're just swept off your feet, Babsy. Guys that are very conscious of their appearance can never be trusted. He could be a player. You're still naive. Me, naive? Lizbeth... I realized I've lost interest in Lester because... Because you realized he's a jerk and not as sophisticated as your boss. Will you see each other after your practicum? What do you think? That is up to you. Eugene is my conquest right now. Conquest? I read my horoscope. Scorpio, for 1996, go for it and work for what you want! So what did you do? I wrote a letter and then I sent it to someone in Eugene's physics class. Lizbeth, you have some nerve. He's moving too slow. That's why I gave him motivation. That would encourage him somehow. Oh, my God. Speaking of the devil. Did he see me? Come on, Lizbeth. You've written him a letter. Don't tell me you're getting shy now. Oh my, he's headed this way. - He's here. - Oh my, how do I look like? - Um. Lizbeth. - Yes. - Can I ask you a favor? - Yes! Next time, wait for the guy to make the first move. It's better that way. I have to go. Lizbeth? Babsy, would it be in bad taste if I commit suicide here? Veronica, why do you seem pale? Are you ill? You should get more air, and your life needs excitement. You should come with us. Loy invited me to go to that sing-along bar again. Not tonight. Maybe next time. You're turning us down again. How did it end up this way? What did we do so wrong? They won't listen even if we explain. What are we gonna do? Does this mean that we have to stop? That will only happen if that's what you want. Is that what you want? No. Are you willing to fight for what we want? Yes. Even if your parents get mad? Is that how important I am to you? Yes. That's what I needed to hear. "I think the time is right and there is nothing left to do. On Tuesday night, February 13, I will go there to the station at exactly 10 p.m. You will finally meet Andy. And I will finally get to know Roni Night. Until then, I will miss you. Love, Andy." Thank you, thank you, Andy. Thank you for writing. I leave it up to you. Like I've said before, there are things that are beautiful because we think they're so unreachable. But the moment that what seems so unattainable comes close, the magic disappears. I guess we'll have to take that risk. I'll be here Andy. I'll wait for you. You have a visitor. Hi! I was in the area and I thought I'd drop by. I'm not bothering you, am I? No, not at all. Are you sure you want to go through with this? - Yes. - Okay, let's go. - Is this the right way? - Of course. Where are we going? I'm still thinking. You, where do you think we should go? It's up to you. Wherever you decide. Let's see. Wait, I got sauce on my hand. You can wash in the kitchen or in the bathroom. - Where's the bathroom? - Go straight, turn right. Okay. If you'll excuse me for a while. Sure. - Lester? - Whose car is parked outside? Why do you just show up without a word? Don't you know that I'm still mad at you? Whose car is parked outside? Babsy, can I borrow a hand towel. So that's why. Lester! - Lester! - What happened? Let me explain first. Why you were so busy? - Let's go. I might kill someone. - Hey. Lester! Do you want me to stay or do you want me to leave? I don't know. I don't know. Gary, where are we going? Look, you asked me to join you, okay? We ran away and now you don't even know where we are going? Will you just let me think for a minute, okay? We're running out of gas. You've been driving for hours! Will you please shut up and let me think for a minute! Why did you ask me to run away? Look, this is the first time I'm going to do this, okay? How do you expect me to... You're the guy, you're supposed to know what to do! Well, I don't know what to do! What's wrong with you? I feel so stupid. This is all so stupid! You know, you're right. This is not only stupid. This is wrong. - Where are we going? - I'm taking you home. - What? - I'm taking you home! Get in the car! Nice shot! Nice! Babsy, let's get out of here. Let's wait until after the practice. Just relax. There's your cheating girlfriend. She's hunting you down. Look at her. I think she's mad again. Lester. Lester, let's talk. Lester, I'm talking to you. I don't want to hear what you have to say. Don't disrespect me. Who disrespected who first? - Don't shout at me. - Go away! Don't shout at me! I said go away! What happened to your friend? Huh? Why is she freaking out? What? Why is your friend freaking out? - There's a girl! - This is humiliating! Lester, don't turn your back on me when I'm talking to you. - Why did you come in here? - Because I want to talk to you. What for? So you can lie to me again? Is that it? I completely trusted you. But you were cheating on me. You're dating that other guy. Don't you realize I'm a man? You insulted me! Of all things, you had to make a fool out of me! Don't you know that you've insulted me as a woman many times? Really? Come on. Don't try to act cute. You're not cute, you're dumb! I thought you were apologizing. Now you're calling me dumb. Because you're really dumb! You think that just because I love you you can get away with anything without taking my feelings into consideration. You're overconfident. You're confident that no matter what you do, I will never leave you. I've changed, Lester, and you didn't notice that. That makes you dumb. You had me fooled. But I was so stupid enough to allow that. But I have changed. I've realized what I want and I want more. I love you. I still love you. And if I leave you right now it is because I want to end our relationship with a little love left in my heart for you. Don't wait for the day when I leave you with only anger left in my heart. You have to grow up. I can do all your assignments. I can do all your term papers. But I cannot grow up for you. That's all you can do. Looks like you're going somewhere. - Yeah, I know. - You're both so dressed up. Are you two going on a date together? Of course not. Marian, are you still awake? Don't sulk. It's not the end of the world. Can you just leave me alone? Look, Marian, I understand. I've been through that. You might think that we're ganging up on you. That's how I felt back then. But, no. We all go through that. Just take it slow. You don't have to rush things. You'll get through this. Hi. Hi. Well, I wasn't sure if my timing was right. If now is the right time for you to see me.
