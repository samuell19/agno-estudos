No Do you have any news of the 110th? The 110th? Come with me Sir, this man is a warrant officer from the 110th You're from the 110th? Yes Captain Staff Sargent Maillat Where is your unit? I lost contact with them Sir - When? - Yesterday afternoon Show me where you lost contact - Here, in Killem - They've taken Killem? Yes Lieutenant, tell HQ they are in Killem Have a rest, sargent - Is the situation serious? - Did you see the map? Not too closely Can you swim? Get to Dunkirk and cross the channel 18 km, it's no big deal On the other side is England Things are easy over there They still play tennis They'll evacuate us? - Their own soldiers yes, but us... maybe - Thanks, see you around - Bye - "Jeanne d'Arc would cry to see France's blood flowing like this" "Why must we make these sacrifices?" "For the arms dealers? For the English bankers?" "The English want us to fight to the last man!" - The nerve! - Do you think we are surrounded? - It's a lie - No, it's true Do you know what a defensive pocket is Father? It's when your back's to the wall When you're 60 you will say to your parishioners "Fritz had me surrounded in Dunkirk" - No way Can we get out of this mess? Yes, time to make a decision We're going to leave? How? By sea We've just walked 200km in 6 days so, we deserve a holiday Saturday Morning, 1st June 1940 - Over here you crazy bastard! - Get out of the open - Me? - Yes! We'll have to move if they see you there! A Stuka going at 500 km/h won't notice me - You're doing this on purpose! I'll cut you down myself if you don't get out of sight! - Alright, come on then! You'd better do it quickly, they're back again! Hey! Hey, take cover! Have you got a smoke? Sorry, didn't see you there It's not that I like to smoke, you understand, but it calms my nerves - Here, take a few There aren't many left Take them, don't worry about it They were cheap A gift from the owner of a bar - Are you kidding me? - No - He wouldn't take your money? - Yes Unbelievable! Was he crazy? - No, just demoralised Demoralised? You like fancy words eh? "Demoralised" If they were all like that It would be great eh? I'd walk into a shop and say: "I'll have that, and that, and that, and that, I'll take them all" Write an IOU, then take off without paying... I'd like to live in a world like that! Where are you headed? - To the hospital Me too Wait for me, I have a passenger This is my Taxi I should have been suspicious when they asked for a driver Now they've got me on a leash This my tenth since this morning and there are plenty more Give me a hand Shit, what now? You, out of the way I have a message for the General - Where do you expect me to go? - Move back! - It's easier for you to move back with your car Drive back four kilometers? I'm ordering you to get out of the way! - I've already been ordered to take civilian corpses to the Hospital Ordered by Captain Blajy I don't give a damn! I obey the orders of my Captain, and nobody else! Do you have the rank to speak to me like that? I'll teach you to obey orders Screw your useless old cart Swearing in front of the dead? - Are you fucking with me? - Wait! calm down There may be a way to sort this out We can push this Austin out of the way If we push it back, we can get out of your way and you can pass OK, good. Let's get it out of the way Lend a hand - What is it? - She's slipping Slide her up a bit Ready lieutenant? - Ok! On my order: OK heave!

Help yourself to some fuel You're right It isn't the cars that are missing, it's the road Careful! So, what do you think will happen? The Germans are coming with tanks and flamethrowers Can we stop them all? - It's possible Anything can happen in war Wait - Why? Ah, the bumps aren't being kind to her So young Life played a cruel trick on you, my beauty It's a tragedy - That's OK now, come on I don't want to get used to things like this I try to stop them, but most of them do The guys in my unit I mean Well I'm afraid that I'm like them now You wouldn't be a school teacher by any chance? No, why? Ah well, you have a serious manner, so I thought... So you think teachers are all serious types eh? No, I've met some funny ones But you must need to this manner to be able to teach So your students don't think you're talking bullshit And you think I have this manner? Yes, I do I'm afraid I have to leave you now I have to find my friends - Ah, so you're leaving me - Yes Good luck, see you around eh - So long! - Thanks Take it easy Hey, are you crazy?

The news is on soon This is General Headquarters Operations continue with the same urgency around the camp at Dunkirk 72 enemy aircraft have been destroyed or damaged Our airforce continues to fight heroically in this sector, for control, of the skies On the Somme and...

Alexander... - What? - If I survive I'm definately going to hit on your wife - There, you are drunk - I see no connection I remember one night when it rained and the wind was blowing a gale, we made love in our little apartment My wife and I were warm in our bed, with just a small lamp to see by That's life eh! Back then it seemed dull There was only the two of us, in our warm bed with our little lamp - Put on some civilian clothes and join the refugees What a blast! They've pushed back the 77th? Either that or a good imitation of it - How far away was the 77th? - The same as the 75th 10 kilometers, at most - Then the Germans are closer than 10 kilometers? Well done, your maths is excellent The situation is clear my old friend Here is the sea, the krauts are closing in, and we're being squeezed in between Going through the ringer Hey, who wants a beautiful walnut bookcase? - Before the war it would have been worth a lot Here, I'll make you a gift of it It'll make good firewood for the pot I love my food hot There's stuff abandoned everywhere It's easy pickings, for a well organised guy, there's a million worth A million Did you hear Maillat?

Come on, I'll take you with me, think about it - I dream of ending the war the same way we started it - With a speech by Daladier? - Bah, you nitwit By getting smashed on Pernod, all of us together This is radio Stuttgart You had tanks, and mighty bombers but, today french soldiers, abandoned, betrayed by their British friends, surrendered by the thousands in the plains of the Oise, the Aisne and in Flanders. French soldiers, you who are still fighting, our brothers we beseech you, stop this absurd and unnecessary struggle Your honour is safe Germany, which did not want this war... Germany.. Cameras... You want? It's a very good camera Hey...A camera? Hey, Maillat! What's up? I thought you were going? - Why do you give a damn? I thought you were leaving that's all, are you still going? - Do you mind? It will be dangerous Think about it a little, good God Bombs during the crossing, submarines, the mines. And, even if you make it to England they will give you a gun and send you back to Brittany, back in the shit And then you're back where you started from Believe me, it's stupid to try So you insist that I stay You must have a reason - I've got a plan! I'm going to disguide myself as a civilian and hole up in a house The Germans will inspect everyone and then lock you up - No, my papers are good "Discharged for cardiac disorder" It's perfect, no? - Cirilli? - No one can hide a thing from you eh So? It's a good idea isn't it? They'll ask what you are doing here I live here - I have a rent receipt - Phony? No, I rented a farm near here Since when? Since yesterday Why are you telling me this? - To put you in the loop - Why me? Well, because you're a nice guy Good, you think I'm sympathetic Thanks But what do you want from me? But, I want nothing, I assure you Say, do you speak German? Ah, here we go You need an interpreter Just calm down and listen I'll put some things away Shoes, tyres Soon they'll be worth gold I'll store away whatever I can get But, the most difficult thing will be getting passes for transport - And you want me to arrange that - Yes - And I'll get a percentage Of course Well, so you say Then? - You saw the news? - Which? Weygand has reformed the army and launched an offensive from the south They've retaken Abbeville, Boulogne and are advancing on Calais. If it's true, they'll be here in two days Oh? You're bullshitting me, no? That would fuck you up nicely if it were true That you arranged to desert I haven't done anything yet So, you're going to chicken out? I'll just fuck it up, I can't count 2 et 2... 5. 5 et 5... 12. I'm not good at business Make way This way Put him there French on the left British on the right French on the left French on the left! Hey, you're still in France! French on the left English on the right They don't want to take us The English can't tell us what to do I'll have a word with him Do you speak French? - French on the left - Are you taking the French? - English on the right, French on the left I asked you a question I said French on the left, English on the right You don't understand me? - Oh, you speak English - Yes. Cease fire! The bastards will be back Why don't you take cover! They'll be back soon I got him! It's beautiful, yes? - Disgusting - Who are you talking about? Oh, no one in particular - What's he saying? - He's congratulating you for... You're trying to embark? "English on the right, French on the left" I'm sorry, those are my orders If you want to leave you should see captain Clark He is at Bray-Dunes. In a yellow house there There's a sign: "Embarcation office." Tell him I sent you My name is Robinson. - Thanks You said "Captain Clark"? Yes You should be able to arrange it there Good luck, mister... - "Maillat." "Maillat." You're all alone with your FM? It's been eight days since I lost my friends - Are they dead? - No It was during the retreat from Belgium, between Bruges and Veurne. A forced march, day and night In the end I was sleep walking When I woke up I found myself on a path I'm lost and alone, just like that My company are all from Bezons, just like me You like them? Yes, why not? But, in the end, they couldn't get along with my FM They called me "Pinot"... That's my name It doesn't make you laugh? - No - Ah... They say "You idiot, get rid of your FM or the Stukas will spot us" I respond: "You can't defend yourselves without my cannon" They say: "Don't stay with us if you want to play the fool" Me - "You've all lost your balls" I gave them a roasting One night, they tried to steal my FM Only aresholes would do this, no? Well anyway, I'm not surprised they ditched me - Just like that - Well are you crazy about me? No, I'm not crazy about you Well, I'm off - Where are you going? I'm going to try and get on a ship I'm going to see that Captain Clark - Captain Clark? - Yes - Impossible - Why? - Impossible - Why is it impossible? I'm not going in I get it I'll come back later Can I help you with something sir? - Excuse me, I was just wondering if you were OK So I came in to check - But you don't know me - Well... I saw you this morning during the bombing raid You were using binoculars, you noticed me across the street Ah yes, I took you for a theif I have the face of a rogue? No But yesterday a soldier came and took half our provisions He was armed, and threatened me - You live alone? - No, with Antoinette and my grand parents I heard your footsteps and came down to see who was here You're brave Can I clean myself up? I only have well water, it's a bit brackish Will using that offend you? Not at all Salt preserves Look, you can guard my revolver. If I step out of line you can use it on me First let me see what I'm dealing with You're taking a risk What if I want to kiss you? You'd shoot someone over that? - No? - No I've kissed before When my cousin comes to visit,he kisses me - He kisses you how? - On the cheek Oh... - But he aims badly so that it ends up on my neck or the edge of my mouth In what way is he your cousin? Like you Not beautiful, but very nice Can I take it out of the holster? Sure, the safety catch is on It's heavy Oh, Jeanne! You're not going to kill him? - Antoinette, you're being silly I'm just joking around Antoinette, my older sister - How do you do Hello You frightened me Get him a towel She's a big coward She wanted us to abandon the house I'm glad you didn't Come into the dining room Your towel smells like lavender I put sachets between the piles of linen Antoinette is happy you are here Oh, Jeanne... Do you want anything? - She is less afraid with you here - Why? Perhaps because you are military - The bombs also fall on us soldiers, but that's what we're for Listen.. More bombs No, that's artillery - What's the difference? - I suppose up close, they're the same - Maybe it would be better if we went down to the cellar Don't tremble like that Go down to the cellar I'll come down later Good bye Come quickly I have to go Already? I wanted to invite you for dinner tonight We would be happy to have you I won't be here tonight I'm trying to ship out That's madness, they're bombing the boats Isn't it madness, to stay in a house exposed to bombs and looters? This is my house I should leave my own house? We would lose everything Wil you come back? Will you return tomorrow? If I'm still here tomorrow, yes Goodbye, Jeanne. You also aim badly My name is Julien. Hey! I have to speak to you, but I am afraid that you'll think I'm crazy - What is it? - Does it seem normal to you for a nun to carry a knife in her shoe? Your're talking nonsense I'm telling you what I saw Two nuns, propping each other up One of them stumbled on a gun, just 10 meters from me She fell and I saw the knife, just like that - You saw an orthopedic shoe with metal fasteners I saw a knife For cutting my balls! - Is that the only thing you saw? No, 15 minutes later they went into the church That's pretty normal for nuns Have you seen the church? It's a ruin - So? - We should get to the heart of this mystery - I have no time to waste - OK, I'll go alone They're an imaginative bunch, these Bezons We'll see, come on Well, your good sisters, your knife... - Shh Remember the fifth columnists A German paratrooper dressed as a priest killed an English colonel Achtung. - What? - Someone is watching us Who? Soldiers? Yes - How many? - Two Now! So Pinot is an idiot yeah? Well you did good work my little honey So we are leaving? Note, when I say "we are leaving," I don't know where to - Go see my friends at our camp, I am leaving anyway Near the entrance to the hospital, an ambulance Ask for Alexander and tell him that you're taking my place My name is Maillat. - I won't invite myself I'm inviting you, nitwit If I don't come back this evening, tell him that I succeeded That's an odd sort of message Has the conference finished? Captain Clark? Yes, what can I do for you? I want to disembark Captain Robinson told me that you can arrange it You know him? We played football against one another Oh, l see. What is your name? - Maillat. "M, a, i, I, I, a, t." That's OK like that? Yes, why? Shouldn't it have a stamp? Ah, you French like to be official Well... Which do you want? Ah, this one is triangular It's more eccentric... I got this from Captain Clarke - What did he say? - "Woman aren't allowed" Let's try somewhere else There are no French here We're only boarding English troops - So this is worthless? - I'm afraid so Captain Clarke was having me on? I can assure you that is his signature - I appreciate the British sense of humor, especially in times of peace Come on, don't get into trouble It doesn't matter Listen, John. You should go I'll manage I don't want to make you a prisoner - I won't leave without you You're not having any luck I suppose they have their orders But for us it's terrible - You're French? - Yes, from Lille We were married on May 10 Very strong, French ciggarettes Hey, come back! Hey, Maillat! Where are you going? To the dunes, to find my friends - You don't want to leave? - If I can I got a pass, but I cannot pass Really? Extraordinary Come with me, I'll sort it out What do you think of this war? - It's rigged - Really? The Germans have gone around the Maginot line Our leader has dismissed us, and our allies, they run away. It's become a stampede You're chaps are running away too - With you, I remain faithful to our alliance - When everything falls apart, you have to regroup to start again Getting our troops out of here will be a great strategic victory One or two more victories like that and you will be in Norway - Who knows? Maybe one day we'll be back in France That's his wife - A woman has no place here - His wife is French They have been married for 3 weeks What's going on? Where is he going? - I asked him if he wanted to get some tea for the young soldier I wouldn't mind a drink either Even your tea A funny sort of honeymoon And I don't think it's over yet My name is Atkins. - Maillat. Don't worry You'll be alright Captain Robinson is with your wife I have no parents Helena is my family, everything Are you married? No One day, you'll see Atkins, long live the bride Come one, Atkins, let's go! You have to jump! You'll get burned, good God! Atkins, you'll get torched! Jump! Jump! Jump! The beach is close Let me help you How do you feel? Sunday Morning, 2nd June 1940 Hey, can you walk? They can fix you up at the Hospital... Preist, are you digging your grave? Where have you been, wiseguy? - You know Father, your hell, I just got a close look at it All your stories priest, they're true It's full of flames, with 2000 ways to twist on the grill Hey, Pierson, I know this question isn't original, but your God, why doesn't he give a damn? I see he took care of you Why only me? He can't do more? - Questioning belief with such simplistic reasoning undermines religion, Maillat, you don't have the stature for that - But I have seen the ways you can twist on the grill when you've seen something like that it's hard to keep your faith You accept God because you need him Yes, I've needed him Like everyone here So where is he? He can't be found in the dunes Trust him and he will answer you With puzzles, yes I present him with a dilema, and he responds with another What were you doing? Burying my gun I don't want to kill anyone else in this war You could have thought of it earlier The first day of the war, for example I was a soldier And does God accept that? God understands that some have to be soldiers - And now - Oh... Pff... The fight here no longer has any meaning Just the aura of pointless death Because elsewhere, there are meaningful deaths? - There are useful deaths... As long as one believes in the fight - You killed someone with your gun... - Yes You didn't say anything before No, it happened so stupidly I found myself nose to nose with him, in the Saar It was him or me I was the fastest Then I felt alone for a long time He was young, almost a kid Lying in the snow, he looked at me with his blue eyes He was afraid He suffered a lot before dying It's idiotic, no? If anyone in this war, doesn't believe like you, it's me and obviously not the German you killed in the Saar Are you so different from me?

No, but I didn't want to kill them They deserved it Do you think so? Yes, anyone would think so What will we do now? What do you think we should do? Let's put them outside The corpse truck will collect them - The corpse truck? Yes, it passes after each bombardment Ah good I'll get the small one first It will mess up the floor if you drag him - Your floor? - Don't leave me with the other one He can't hurt you now Hey guys! - What do you want? - You've got a customer in the street on the right - I'll go back later - You can't do that He's waiting there, stinking of death Well, let's go Ho, bike rider What a world We have an army where the dead are carried on trucks and we have to walk - You'd prefer it the other way around? - Yes, and how!

Come on - There is another one up there What, upstairs? We only collect them from outside He's too heavy for me When I say no, I mean no And you? If you have a cigarette... A whole pack - In that case, I must perform this service for my country My buddy out there, he makes out like he's all prim and proper But I saw him stealing wedding rings from the corpses You might think that the dead don't care about these things, but it's not something I would do The dead should be respected And this one, was he your friend? - No Thanks Was he hit by shrapnel? No, it was me - And the other one? - That was me as well Ah And her? - They were trying to rape her Ah... That's why you... - Yes Ah, the scum Two against a kid Is she your daughter? No Ah, bastards You did well You think so? You did well to send them down below Are you going to help? Wait Let her rest - I'm not doing any harm by looking at her Ah, the bastards There was no need to be cruel to her But in a sense I understand What bastards - Come on OK, calm down, we'll go That was kind of you, she looks like a nice kid It's like she was entrusted to you Don't you think? OK, go! Where are you going? - Back to the beach Don't go yet Do not leave me alone - What about Antoinette? - She's with friends, six kilometers from here, she got frightened - And your grand parents? - They died two years ago I know, I lied I was scared, so I made you think they were still alive You should leave and find Antoinette I have to guard the house It's all we have, Antoinette and I If it's bombed, you'd rather be there? - It's stupid, but I think that if I remain, nothing will happen to it Quick, the basement! All these sausages... You've got a lifetime supply - Antoinette made sure, we would have enough You won't leave me will you? Not after the bombing? I'll give you some advice Leave your house and go with Antoinette. Your house is finished - Not if I stay Great, stay! - But I can't stay alone, I am too scared "Scared", you? Yesterday you were on your balcony, with your binoculars I'm not afraid of bombs I'm scared of seeing more like the ones who came before, especially the small one with the malicious eyes I know, I know No, you don't know You killed them It was easy for you, you enjoyed it Ah, you think so? I will not be your bodyguard Ah, so you are afraid, then leave you coward! To say that I killed for that Julien, you do not love me What is this performance all about now? Did I make promises, did I ask for your hand, did I sleep with you? How did we suddenly become so intimate? Well I love you What won't you do for your house! Well, keep your house And when the Germans arrive, and mount a machine-gun in front of your sausages? Are you crazy? No, I am not crazy You're a funny bitch, you know If this is what you wanted, why didn't you let those bastards do it? Get out! No, not like that, Julien! Hey Alexander, we've got a visiter Ah, there you are! There you are, you son of a bitch! Holy Christ, you son of a bitch! Motherfucking son of a bitch, where have you been? Who cares? Why the long face? Are you hungry? I kept your mess tin No You want... You want some wine? No How about I make you coffee? No, I don't want anything! Give him whisky Dh?ry left us That one, with his millions... Hey that was a great idea to send us Pinot I like that Pinot - Don't annoy me with Pinot and his bloody FM - Bloody hell, I can't say anything without you biting my head off! Hey that's the water for our coffee! Be careful, bloody idiot! You go get it this time Alexander, I killed two men Two Germans? Ah, It just occured to me The only men I've killed in this war, they were both French - Why did you kill them? - They were trying to rape a young girl Oh, the bastards That's what I thought But it doesn't make me feel any better about it - You don't... - Yes In the end she offered herself to me - So, that's not the same - I'm not sure Don't cry about it That's just how it worked out War, it's never clean I'll make some coffee - I'll get the water - Sit down - It's my turn, I'll get it - You clowns are making me laugh now Give me that, come on give me a break! - Stop behaving like an old woman - Old woman, my arse! Shit - Tell me... what are you going to do with this young girl? Why? You want me to do the honourable thing? That's what's bothering you, huh? You want me to bring her to you, so that you can recite your latin magic and poof, everything is fixed No, I just wondered if she'd be OK I'll take care of her You and me are alike. We're the ones with a conscience Except that I am celibate Well, you're a priest... - Those idiots are still attacking the Hospital - No, it's the 75th's artillery, they've found them hiding over there Is anyone here? Ah, I forgot if he's called "Anthony" or "Alexander" He's a bit of a character He's not here? - He's at the water pump What do you want? - Well... You won't take it out on me? - Why? What for? I have something to tell you OK, calm down and have a drink I just came from the water pump The planes dived on us - And? - Well... They arrived at the same time as your friend He's injured? - Go down there, you'll see - Oh Christ You're a priest? Yes Well... I'm sorry, it's too late Go, Get out of here guys There's nothing to see here That should have been me No, why do you say that? If I had gone to get the water You couldn't have known Listen, Maillat... That's the way it happened, that's it Yes That's the way it happened I just found out, by chance An honest guy A nice guy... A guy - Shut up What will we do now? Will we take him back to the van? We could put him to rest tonight, and I'll make him a cross No If we mark his grave he'll be put with all the others - What then? - We'll bury him in the dunes In the dunes? That's not right You're humane? With this gun? With this thing you lug around? Oh, well, OK... - Maillat... you aren't the only one feeling bad right now Hey, Pinot! Come back He was buried to quickly Good, I said it It wasn't done properly But if it had been, I could have made him a cross And a cross, that changes everything It's not worth having a priest as a friend, if you end up buried like this We should write to his wife Yes Do you want me to do it? Yes No, I'll do it I know what you will write to her That he died a hero, that his character was exemplary, that his sacrifice was useful I know the drill In this situation, you can't write what you want - I would tell her that he died while going to get water, to make coffee for his friends Areyou coming back to the camp? No, you know, without him there... I'm going to Bray-Dunes - Is that where she lives? - Yes And you? Oh, I don't know If you had stayed, I would have stayed I guess I'll go to the Hospital and see what I can do There are thousands of casualties And you, Pinot? - I found some of my countrymen with their own camp On cue And you're happy with them? - They're my people It's quiet without his voice But I still have it in my ear You're out? - Don't give me the whole pack - I have my pipe For what I smoked before Thanks Well, see you around guys This is it then Goodbye preist See you around Pinot. You didn't hear me? Are you asleep? What are you doing? You've put lipstick on now? You're angry with me? I promised to come back I'm back Answer me when I speak to you Something has changed? Whose fault is that? It's my fault, OK But some of it is yours too A nice girl shouldn't enjoy playing the vamp, because you are believed and, afterwards, it's too late to take it back Anyway, I won't let you down... Listen, I will dress in civilian clothes, and stash my uniform somewhere I won't leave you again You'll marry me? If you want to You promise? Yes You're serious, I have a husband? - What is that? - It was to defend myself You're a funny little puma Not at the table! - It's not the only table in the world - Julien! Not again! Open your eyes Everyone has left Bray-Dunes except you It's a tomb, this house Go, pack your bags - Leave my house, just like that? I have to pack everything away You want an artillery shell to help you? Don't bring us bad luck Good God, this house! Listen, if you want to, I'll go It's your house or me But where will we go at this hour? We can't sleep on the dunes Sure we can - But they are bombing the dunes as well - Not as much as here And if we leave tomorrow? I beg you, let's stay until tomorrow Stay here tonight We'll leave tomorrow, I promise Tomorrow, there you go again Listen to me To the left of the Hospital you'll find our van It's an ambulance You won't forget? No, but why are you telling me this I understand that, tearing yourself away from your house is very difficult, and it will hurt you Come on, close your eyes Come on, close your eyes - Jeanne... I'll wait for you at the van until 7pm You'll wait for me? What do you mean? This is Calais In a few hours the supreme leader of the Wehrmacht will be announcing That Dunkirk has fallen after fierce fighting 30000 incendiary bombs, have set the city ablaze This success has been achieved, through the exemplary action of the Luftwaffe Because of its size and power, our Army, could not fully deploy, in the area protected by our aircraft Are you nuts, what are you doing here? Come on, we're leaving from Dunkirk tonight By warships and merchant vessels, the cost to the enemy has been severe We sunk during this operation: 16 cruisers, 37 destroyers, 5 submarines, 3 destroyers, and 183 boats of Commerce and transport. Holland and Belgium have surrendered The armies of, France and England are destroyed We have won one of the greatest victories in history Since our adversaries continue to refuse peace, the fight will continue until their total destruction
