HD Presentation The digitization and restoration of this film remain faithful to the body and spirit of the original work. They have been made possible by funding from Québec for Québecers! 200 years after the British conquest of 1760 Québecers again fight for their independence. Like the Patriotes of 1837, the Québec Liberation Front takes action, stealing the guns and money, dynamiting, etc. Year after year, police break up FLQ networks. In response to this repression, and to free their jailed comrades, FLQ militants launch Opération Libération. This film tells a true story based on respect for facts and people. Watch his arm. Calm down! Try again. Wait, it'll start. Ok, easy now. Necessary and unjustifiable. Eight days earlier... We interrupt this program for a special news bulletin. Good evening, Alain Pratte at the news desk. We have just received a communiqué from James Cross's abductors. An anonymous call alerted reporter André Laplante at 7:45 p.m. to the envelope in a Jean Talon St phone booth. Here is the new message from the Liberation Cell: Communiqué #6. The Québec Liberation Front temporarily suspends its threat to execute diplomat James Cross. - They caved in! To keep alive this representative of the old British colonialist and racist regime, we demand: 1) An immediate end to all searches and arrests by police 2) The release of political prisoners as set out in Communiqué #1 by 6 tomorrow. The FLQ solemnly promises to release the diplomat alive... They're backing down again! They're backing down again! - ...after our 23 comrades have been liberated. 6 p.m. tomorrow. No way! They keep caving in. The government'll never negotiate. Can't we reach them? No one knows where they are. But they do call Louise. And so? - The way I see it, Québec'll never negotiate. Not for some minor British diplomat. We have to do something. Like what? The pigs are everywhere, the organization's in a mess. If we don't move we have no future. This is our biggest coup in 7 years. If it fails the FLQ's credibility will be destroyed. We have no choice. We have to get the government to negotiate. The US Consul, then. He'll have taken precautions by now. They can block the Île des Soeurs bridges in 2 minutes. What about that other guy, in Westmount? Too far. We'd never get out alive. Guys, I got it. The scumbag. Yeah, the scumbag. It's right nearby too. Pierre Laporte in St Lambert. That must be it. Hello, is this the home of Mr Laporte, the MP for Chambly? I worked for the party in the last elections. I have a favor to ask him. How about at supper time? Perfect. Thanks very much. He's working at home all day tomorrow. Ok, guys. When you fight, you have to go all the way. We have to do something. If we go ahead we all know what it means. They'll have to listen. This'll make a real blast. Québec Liberation Front manifesto: The FLQ is not the messiah or a modern-day Robin Hood. It's a group of Québécois workers dedicated to ensuring Québecers take their destiny in hand. The FLQ seeks full independence for Québecers united in a free society and purged of that clique of sharks the big bosses who've made Québec their personal preserve of cheap labor and exploitation. The FLQ isn't a movement of aggression but the response to the aggression organized by capital and its puppets, the government. Knowing we'll always be the servile boot-lickers of big shots. As long as Westmount, TMR, Hampstead, Outremont exist... capitalist bastions from St Jacques St to Wall St, we'll be a society of terrorized slaves. We're Québécois workers, we'll go all the way. One day all the Westmounts of Québec will disappear. Our struggle can end only in victory. A people cannot be held in misery for long. Vive free Québec. Vive the political prisoners. Vive the Québec revolution. Vive the Québec Liberation Front. He's home. That's him there! He's alone. - Go on! Don't move! - Keep quiet, you pig! Not a word. Don't move or you're dead! Fast! Lie down, you bastard! The TNT! Move and it'll blow! The note! Quiet! They're blocking it. They're not moving. We're ok, guys. We made it! We made it. We did it! Get out. Ok, walk. Careful. Careful of the door. Got him? - Yeah. Watch it, there's a bed. Lie down. The FLQ's Chénier Cell threatens to execute Pierre Laporte, whom it calls the Minister of Unemployment and Assimilation. In Québec City, the government is refusing to comment. There's total silence. Still no news of diplomat James Cross, abducted 5 days ago. Where is he, fuck? He's been gone since 6. Arrested? And if they won't negotiate? They'll negotiate. Yeah, but... let's say they refuse. We have the big end of the stick. I'm sure they'll negotiate. They have to. Do you want anything? I'd like a glass of water, please. Lift your head. Slowly. Thank you. Still no news from Québec? No. What time is it? - One a.m. Are you hungry? No, I'm fine. Well... If you need anything, just call. Hey, guys, he's here! About time! - We thought the cops got you. I couldn't take the subway. - Right, it's being watched. Did you reach the other cell? No. I left a message with Louise. See this? That suck Bourassa rushed back from New York. If he stood up Rockefeller, he must take us seriously. "Laporte is a pillar of the Bourassa government. Like British commissioner James Cross, Laporte is 49 years old. He was born in Montréal, the son of a doctor. He graduated in law from the Université de Montréal. He was then admitted to the bar. He first gained visibility as Le Devoir's parliamentary correspondent in Québec City. He was vp of the Montréal Chamber of Commerce and was elected MNA at the age of 40. Under Premier Lesage he served as ministers of culture and municipal affairs. Considered to be ambitious..." - Tell me! "his bid to lead the Liberal Party failed." Embarrassing. That's how it is. "After criticizing his opponent's ties to business, he was defeated by Robert Bourassa. Laporte was named vice premier, minister of labor and immigration." They left out his mafia links. Any toilet paper? Thanks. The FLQ Wants All These Prisoners Freed Ok? "We repeat. If by 10 p.m. both Ottawa and Québec have not accepted the FLQ's seven conditions Minister Pierre Laporte will be executed. Victory is ours. That ok? We agreed? - Ok with me. We'll use his ID as proof. "Mr Robert Bourassa... Dear Robert... I'm writing the most important letter of my life. I'm in perfect health for now. I'm treated well, even courteously. I insist that the police cease all... all efforts to find me which could only end in a bloodbath. In short, my life is in your hands. You know my situation. Both my brothers are dead. I'm the head of a family that includes my mother my sisters, my own wife and children as well as Roland's children. My death would be a tragedy. I'm sure you understand. If the prisoners' release is organized in good faith, I am certain I will be safe. I, and others who would follow. This can go quickly. I don't see why they'd keep me rotting away in the place where I am held. Choose life or death for me. I'm counting on you. Best wishes Pierre Laporte." Let's send it. Three o'clock. Maybe the government'll negotiate. Maybe. May I ask you a question? Yes? How old are you? Nineteen. Nineteen... Why do you do this? I mean, the FLQ, the violence? Because. It's the only way to change things. Otherwise nothing ever happens. You never listen. Yes, but... This isn't Latin America. We live in a democracy. The people elect the government, the people decide. The people? What a joke! The people never asked you. Yes, but... It's kiss my ass, this so-called democracy. Where creep bosses yell at you all day long for starvation wages. "Don't like it? Scram, go on welfare! Twenty others waiting for your job." That's the democracy we get! "You're nothing! Shut up and work, shitface." "Move, you bum, this is company property." Wanna know why the FLQ? I'll tell you. Cause we're fed up. We can't take it anymore. We've had it. That clear enough? It has to change! The FLQ ultimatum expires in less than two hours. Laporte will be freed 24 hours after the release of all prisoners. The least hesitation by authorities will be fatal to the minister. We still have no word from the cell that abducted James Cross six days ago. The premier's office says Bourassa will hold a press conference to announce his government's position. The demands of the Chénier Cell are... Not hungry? I needn't say how deeply we care about the lives of Mr Laporte and Mr Cross. Fate, in a rare display of cruelty has made them bear the burden for maintaining law and order. It is because we care about the lives of Mr Laporte and Mr Cross.... - Where's he going? With him, black means white. - Shut up! ...mechanisms guaranteeing that the release of the political prisoners leads unquestionably to the hostages' safety. This is a condition that common sense dictates we pose. For this reason we ask that the abductors communicate with us. He accepts! I knew it! I knew it! He'll negotiate! Are you sure? - You heard him, he wants you to contact them. He's going to settle. - It worked! It worked! Today's man has the face of flagellation. And you, Land of Québec, Mother Courage, in your long march you are swollen with our blackened dreams with the vast fatigue of bodies and souls. I am born your son, from up there in the old grated hills of the North. I hurt and struggle with the bite of birth while in my arms my youth blushes. Here are my knees, may people forgive us. We've let our fathers' wisdom be humiliated. We've let the light of the word be debased to shame and self-contempt in our brothers. We've failed to bind our roots of suffering to the universal pain in each man swallowed. I join the burning companions whose struggle breaks the bread of our common fate in the shifting sands of gregarious distress. We shall make you, Land of Québec a bed of resurrections and a thousand blinding metamorphoses. of our leavens, whence the future shall rise, of our steadfast will. Men shall hear your pulse beat in history. It is we, rippling in our October autumn. It is the ruddy sound of deer in the sunlight the future, clear, the future committed. ...both cells have suspended threats to execute their hostages. A communiqué signed by the FLQ's Chénier Cell says the government's delay in responding is unacceptable. The premier's office has yet to name the government mediator. FLQ lawyer Robert Lemieux... Thanks. Sure Bourassa'll negotiate? - I'm certain. He's taking his time. Why don't they name a mediator? It's normal. Government's a big machine. You have to consult, approve... You have to respect each level of authority: the cabinet, parliament, lawyers, bureaucrats, advisors... The list's endless. Only normal it takes time. Don't get upset. Shouldn't be much longer. I know how it works. Damn, that's a nice watch. It was a gift. What's on it? The phases of the moon. It even has a perpetual calendar. Never seen one that nice. What's it worth? 1000 bucks. - 1000 bucks? That's nothing. At Birk's I've seen watches worth $3,000, even $5,000. 5,000 bucks for a watch? Or as much as $10,000. You ok? Yeah. The negotiations? No word. BB's delivering a communiqué. Sure you're ok? It's tough. Don't know if... Seeing him tied up on his bed like a... It's tough. Being in jail wasn't this bad. We could take walks and go outside. We weren't kept in all day. I know it's hard, but... think of our 20 guys inside. Laporte'll be free in a few days. Gabriel's been in 7 years. 7 years between 4 walls. His brother, 6 years. Think of Schirm... 24 hours a day for 3 years in a cell on death row. Or Edmond... I know... I know all that. But I still find it hard. This time, it's me... I put on and take off the handcuffs. I'm the screw. He was the best recruit we'd seen in 3 years. He's a farm boy, he finds it tough being locked up. Think it's fun for me? Think I like seeing him tied up on his bed? I can't go in there, can't even look at him. The bastards! You try to get out of the shit... you just make it worse. - We had no choice. Always a choice. We could've stayed in the US. Hid out, like so many others. We interrupt our regular program for a special bulletin. We've learned Québec has named Robert Demers a 33-year-old lawyer to negotiate the release of Cross and Laporte. It's a first step toward a peaceful resolution to these tragic events. Mr Demers met his FLQ counterpart, Robert Lemieux, last night in the cell where Mr Lemieux is being held. They've finally budged! I added 3 points to put more pressure: 5) To show our good faith, we'll suspend activities and ask the same of other cells. 6) Any hesitation will lead to the execution of Pierre Laporte. 7) There is no deadline. But if you show bad faith we'll act. Victory is ours. Everyone agree? Ok with me. Me too. Laporte wants to order in. He's sick of spaghetti. What do you mean? He's hungry, he wants to order food for all of us. He'll pay. He'll pay. Here he is. You order chicken? How much? $38,78. It was hard finding the place. Had to ask the army base to find it. With all that's going on, things are pretty hot. Keep the change. Thanks a lot! This guy's at a diner. He asks the waitress, Got any pea soup? Sure. You want the peas whole or puréed? Whole. I'll purée it myself! Another? No, I have to go. See you. Ok, he's gone. Alright, guys, show time! It's ok, I'll go. His change. A real joker. You don t eat? Want your coleslaw? I'll take it. Want my gravy too? Motor oil. Thinking of Francine? Yeah. She makes me feel so good. It's amazing. Don't know if we'll sing after this. I dunno. This way. Careful. Ok, left. We're there. Sit down. A trash bin in the Berri station. No, westbound. Victory is ours. The boss was a little runt, a real rat. Always screaming Fucker! Bastard! It was always, Move it! Go! We never even had time to pee. On night shift he'd take the girls up to his office and screw'em. He laid them all. Anyone who refused... Out! I kept quiet, like everyone else. It was like we had to kneel to get our paychecks. At CN it was the opposite. Three guys to change a light switch. Should've seen those jerks. Pot bellies like this. A sign of seniority. I was scared I'd get like them. Growing fat, waiting for a gold watch. Two weeks in Old Orchard. The big car, big payments, big bungalow... That's no life. I was scared. So I quit. No one knows our number! What is it? What do we do? Answer. Hello? - It's me. It's BB. Don t know why I took the subway. Luckily I noticed. I'm at Henri's. The guy from the RIN. No, they didn't ask, they're willing to help. The cops didn't arrest me cause they want all of us. I'll go to Josée's. If I don't call by 10... it's cause I was arrested. I know it's not safe, but what else can I do? Take care of yourselves. Good luck. What? Thanks. Don't move. Here... it ought to do. It's Jules. A blue Ford with two guys in it. Pretending to read and sleep. A real pro! - Let's go watch tv. Let me stay! - Come on. ...French Canadians are not executive material. His words angered Québecers who for centuries saw top positions always go to Anglophones. The protests showed English Canada Québec wouldn't tolerate such discrimination. In 1963, the FLQ was born- the Québec Liberation Front. Its first target was the spot where Wolfe claimed his victory... then the Ministry of Revenue, RCMP headquarters CN Rail, the Black Watch armory the RCAF, the Queen Victoria Monument the La Grenade shoe factory the Paul Sauvé arena... I'm sure he won't talk. Sure? Listen to you! When you're handcuffed and the pigs are bashing you in the face you never know how you'll react. Not until you're there. Anyway, so what if the cops come? No more playing games, we'll negotiate face to face. Yes? It's BB. He managed to get away. You can't come here, you've been spotted. Use your head, you idiot. So there'll be three of us. So what? You'll work outside. Well fuck security! You have to phone. They're stalling, not negotiating. We need to put on pressure. You have to reach the other cell. Ok, take care. They were at the St Henri Workers' Council. Bust everything up. They took a few papers. Nothing important. But the place is a mess. They raided the clinic too. André called. I'll check. - You're stealing the initiative from us. - Initiative, what a joke! When we acted, Québec had the initiative. You went back on every demand. You showed the FLQ as weak. You kept knuckling under! You were going to kidnap the US Consul too. It's all we could do. Independence isn't just language. I told you, it's all we could do. "It's all we could do!" - What then? If you don't know, why're you here? Reading about revolution is fine. But this isn't a book! It's real. It's tough and dirty and it stinks. It's not a game! It's not for fun or kicks. A hostage's life, our lives, are important. We had to strike. We had to organize! The proof is, you've got us in shit. It wasn't the time to act. When the cops bust the FLQ in June, we had to rebuild, start over. You called us chickens. You were in a hurry. Rebuilding a network wasn't revolutionary enough. Money and cars weren't hot enough! - Stop it! I'm not here for a lecture. What counts is that we agree and that negotiations succeed! If we stop sending communiqués it'll pressure the government. You can negotiate. We won't budge on our demands. And Laporte? - Leave him to us. Do what you want with Cross. This'll hit or miss, but the bastards'll negotiate! No more ham. There's some jam left. What are they up to? I dunno. They're planning something. Hard to tell with Bourassa. He never makes a decision, just waits for problems to go away. Maybe they're only stalling. Maybe. Little jerk. Premier of Québec! He couldn t even run a Steinberg's. Ok, get up. It's going to sting. There's no ham. I made you jam sandwiches. Thank you. Isn't there some other way? My back and shoulders ache. If I could at least change position. I'll try to think of something. Thanks. It's been two hours! He buying out the store? The police! One sound and we all blow up. We'll show'em who we are. We're done playing around! Now we'll negotiate. Come on! Come and get us, you bastards! You want Laporte? Come and get him! C'mon, you bastards! What are they up to? C'mon, you scumbags! I don't believe it. It can't be. What is it? What? Tell me! They raided across the street. It was heavy. When I came in the living room, I was shaking. You? It's funny, I wasn't scared of dying. Didn't occur to me. I was scared of killing. - You've done bank jobs. It's not the same. In a bank, I knew we wouldn't shoot anyone. This time my gun was loaded. If the pigs had come in, no question... I was ready, I'd have fired. What about him? Scared to death. He's ok now, but when I took him back he was shaking like a leaf. I'll go see. Are you hungry? No thanks. Would you like some tea? No thanks. You don't need anything? - No, I'm fine, thank you. English Canada fears the passionate support shown for the FLQ manifesto. Angry Québecers crowd the Paul Sauvé arena in a display of separatist solidarity. Yes! Yes? It's BB. We're listening. 3,000 people! Too goddamn much! We will organize intelligently. We will choose our ground. Victory is ours! Damn that feels good! Guys! Quick, come look! Wake up! Something's happening at the army base. They've written me off! They've written me off! They caved in to Ottawa. Bourassa's just a puppet. Trudeau pulls the strings. They know they've lost control. People support the manifesto. 20 priests in the Gaspé... And the bishop of Rimouski. "The bishop stressed that the FLQ's demands are based on real, not imaginary needs." The army means we won. Trudeau's sending in the army a victory? You crazy? The army means anything can happen. It's a whole new game. People'll see the real Trudeau... Why the English gave him the job. It's Bourassa! Québec has announced its final position in the negotiations with the FLQ. As to the preliminary question- the safe release of Laporte and Cross- the government proposed the Red Cross serve as an intermediary between the two sides. To the FLQ's demands, the government responds as follows: 1) It refuses to grant amnesty to all the prisoners named by the FLQ. It will however recommend the conditional release of five prisoners who have made such a request and has already taken steps to this effect. 2) The authorities... Fuck you, you bastards! ...members of the FLQ who abducted Mr Laporte and Mr Cross. 3)The authorities will ensure a plane is ready to fly them to their destination. 4) As for the other conditions the government of Québec cannot accept them. Québec made this decision after studying the implications of all possible alternatives. We've been screwed by that stupid little... shitface bastard. The scumbag fucked us up the ass! All the way! Stop it. Goddamn sewer rat! Like fools. Like fools, goddammit! - Stop it. That goddamn puking shitface! That sell-out! Crook! - Enough! It's goddamn crazy. Not so loud. They won't negotiate. So? - So? We're cooked. - No, we're not cooked. Nothing's changed. Not politically. We have Cross and Laporte. Every day support for us grows. The union's with us. Students are striking. Time's on our side. Time's on our side? Get real. This isn't organized, it's amateur night. We have 13,000 pigs and 8,000 soldiers on our asses. The most important thing is to hold on. Now's the tough part. A massive operation has been under way since 5 a.m. Searches and arrests are being stepped up. As yet we are unable to name all those arrested... What do we do? Police are rounding up any and all suspects. Future plans... - What do we do? At 4 a.m. this morning Ottawa declared the War Measures Act. The FLQ has been outlawed, civil rights are suspended. War measures! - ...the right to arrest those deemed to belong to the FLQ because of previous acts or statements. Those arrested can be held 21 days before being charged and 90 days before a judge sets a trial date. They cannot be released on bail without the attorney general's consent. The retroactive law calls for prison terms of up to 5 years. Last night army troops began to take position throughout the city. They will ensure the protection of public buildings and assist the police. Meanwhile, arrest and searches without warrants continue at an accelerating rate. Among the people... I'd shoot the whole lot of them, the FLQ. Hang'em by the balls. What do you know jerk? Join your pals in Siberia! Happy in his pile of shit. Jesus, we've got a long way to go. His brain's on strike. You better eat. I'll leave it here in case. If you want anything... The government has the initiative. We're stuck. Pull another kidnapping? With whom? With what? We read 150 arrested. 150? I heard 200, maybe even more. Not just in Montréal. All across Québec. In Sherbrooke, Hull, Chicoutimi. They're out to silence all opposition. They're trying to scare people. I don't know. I don't know! Nothing we can do for now. Did you hear what Choquette said? He was asked about using the War Measures Act to declare the Mafia an illegal organization like the FLQ. The turd answered, The Mafia's not illegal. How's that for a minister of justice? Keep the change. Thanks. See you. Shut up! Smash the window. Careful. Quiet! Lift him up. He's a mess. - Take him to the living room. Check the neighbors. You first! He's cut here. Press down hard, like me. Go on, press! That's it. His chest's ok. I'll make a tourniquet. Take over for me. Press down hard. The broom handle. Get me towels, dishrags, anything. And water! - In what? Anything. The dish pan. A pot. Hurry! Is it too tight? You'll be ok. Bring the bandages. Wrap it around. Tie it up. That's it, the other side. That's it. Wrap it around. Get him to the hospital. - Later! Undo the tourniquet. We have to take him to hospital now! We can't. But he's going to die. We can't just release him. He's dying, don't you see? We have to take him! Calm down. He's ok. We can't release him. What do you mean? He's dying, can't you see? He's not going to die. Look at him! Look! All the blood. - He won't die. You don't care. - Listen to me! If we didn't, we wouldn't be here. We can't back down! Empty words! Empty words? You say that to me? We didn't force anyone. We knew what we were doing. We risked our lives! Words? - Ok, this isn't the time! We're at the end. We won't back down. Alright! We can't let him go now. Think about it. After all we've done? I don't care what we've done. A man is dying. I don't give a fuck about politics. Understand? I did everything with you. We fought together, went hungry, robbed banks together. I'd give both my arms for independence. But not this. We have no right. We're not murderers. Murderers... Shit! - Just forget it. He's completely flipped out. Do what you want, but... he's gotta go. Either that or I'll go berserk. He has to leave. Look... maybe you're right. I'm mixed up too. Maybe we should take him to hospital. But we can't decide like this. We've always decided us four together. We have to ask BB. He's not here. Here's what we'll do. You'll go to Louise's and try to reach him. I want to stay here. Why don't you go? The neighbors, we can't attract attention. You're the only one who's been out. He could die 10 times before then. The hospital! Take me to the hospital. Take me to the hospital. Please. Forget what I said. Good luck. I'll be back soon. Take care of him. Don't worry. See you later. How did he get undone? Think it was him? - Maybe. Could've been me. He's not sure. He wants to wait and see. - Wait? Wait for what, dammit? That fool! Yeah? Keep him? He's hurt, he's not moving, we have nothing here. We can't take him on the subway. We've reached the end. There aren't 36 choices. Just two. Either we free him or... What negotiations? Québec's out of it. Trudeau and his gang of two-timers are running it. 250 jailed. Our communiqués banned. They control everything, newspapers, tv, radio... We have two choices. Ok, but hurry. This is unbearable. What did he say? He'll call back. He has to think. We're fucking screwed. We're dead in the water. Let's say we free him... We do like the Liberation Cell. We back down. It's like it was all for nothing. We fall on our knees. It's like saying there's no point fighting. The other side's always stronger. We'll be beaten again. Beaten from generation to generation. An entire people defeated. Who don't even remember what freedom is. We can't back down. Where'd Laporte's campaign money come from? The money to run against Bourassa? They've made him a saint, but he's a crook, everyone knows. No one will care. That's not an argument. He may be a scumbag. You can't kill someone for that. People die every day, in South America, Ireland... Children starve to death. Don't forget. It's not the same. - Let me finish. Think Jews lose sleep when they shoot Palestinian kids? So why should we? It's not the same. Laporte's no war criminal. He didn't torture anyone. He's no monster. People won't applaud when you kill him. Course, no blood on his hands. But he defends a 200 year old system of exploitation. They sign papers, vote laws. They stay clean and protect the vultures. But those who die every day in mines in factories and on building sites to make those dogs rich... They play at democracy but when it gets in their way, no problem... Fire away! It scares the others. We weren't allowed to move. They separated us. My husband was in the bedroom. We had machine guns pointed at us. Her first reaction she was nervous. She got up... "May I go to the bathroom, sir?" Some of them were nice. "Go ahead, Miss." Then the fat guy arrived. "Go with the bitch!" They followed her to the john with their guns. Later I asked if I could go to the toilet too. I asked, "May I close the door. I'm ashamed in front of men." "No way, you shit!" They watched me. I had to dress with a machine gun pointed at me. - His temperature's ok. But his heart... They're up to 300 arrests. Still going on. We're trapped. We're at the edge. If we don't jump, we lose face. Not just face. We lose everything. Down the line. If we jump, we also lose. People won't accept it. We have to free him. We have to free him. To show resistance is possible. That there's hope. We have to show we're serious. Do we want independence and change, yes or no? But there's a price to pay, we have to fight. They'll never allow independence, Québec's their bankroll. We don't have the right. We can't kill for political ideas. We're not at war. Yes, we're at war. The other side'll do anything to crush us! Anything! We'll just sink deeper into defeatism. Do you really believe that? I don't believe it. When I joined you guys, you talked about justice freedom, life... It can't be. You've grown so hard. I'm hard? Yes. I'm hard. Because it's hard. I'm not sure it's right. If you knew how unsure I am... But deep down, you see... something tells me we can't go back. We're responsible for what we started. Responsible. I know, but we have to, fuck! Fucking shit! Anyway, he's almost dead. His heart's beating, but... Could you do it? Could you shoot him? Couldn't even shoot your dog when he was run over. We can't shoot him, the neighbors will hear. Forget it. There's no way. We have to. We have no choice. It's not an order, shit! Have I ever given orders? That's not true. I'm there. We have to answer them. That's my opinion. Think about it, I'll call back. I'm with you guys. Bye. We're militants, not killers. Half an hour ago you said yes. Now you don't know. I feel like I'm in a meat grinder. The screw's turning. No going back. We're in the funnel and it's pushing, pushing... There's only one way out. We'll come out in little pieces. We gotta do it. I can't. It's done.
