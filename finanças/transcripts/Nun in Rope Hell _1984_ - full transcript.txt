I am Mother Isabella, the Superior. Thank you. I hope you'll be a good servant of the Lord... and I believe it is your desire too. It's OK, you don't need to say anything. I pray for the Lord... to guide you onto the right path. Yes. If you have any questions... you can ask Sister Cecilia. As you can see, I am not well. She is taking charge... of the convent's administration. Thank you for your kindness. We are all Jesus' servants. Sister Maria, you're now part of our family. Yes. Oh merciful God... Through Your Son Jesus Christ... who suffered on the cross to save the world... please forgive our transgressions... and give us the strength to resist temptation. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ... Amen. Allow me to introduce someone. Sister Maria. I'm Maria, thank you for your kindness. I'm Sister Theresa. - You can call me Eiko. - Sure. Let me show you my room. It's a simple room. What is a pretty woman like you doing here? Abandoning the world? Or is it better if I don't know? The room at the end is for novices. Is that a rule? Well, it's a custom. So many memories here. You better be careful. I was raped in that bed. Raped? Or was it a dream? No one can come in here, right? Right. Those beasts we call 'men'... couldn't even bring in a cat. That's why it was probably a dream. It had to be a dream. I wouldn't mind reliving it everyday though. Mr. Honda... I'm sorry I left without a word. Please forgive me. The beautiful memories we share... will stay with me forever. No! No! Oh Lord... Forgive me for I have sinned. Thank you. Master Kumaki is a fervent believer. You know the writer Bunzo Kumaki? No. His contribution to this establishment is considerable. He donated those warm virgin wool blankets. He poured so many blessings on us. We are so grateful. Today, we'd like you to represent us... and show him our gratitude. Yes. Cecilia will go with you. We're presenting you with a great honor. His driver is coming to fetch us. What a strange man. He's Mr. Kawabe's driver and private secretary of the Master. What a beautiful sight. Wasted away to serve Jesus... What a pity. Sir. Forgive my rudeness. How are things going at the convent? Great, thank you for your concern. Those warm blankets made us happy. Good. Look here, such a pretty nun visiting me. This will doubly encourage my generosity. Look at you. Sister Maria. You see, the Master likes to joke. But when he writes, he's very serious. I can't grasp a line of his prose. I would like Sister Maria to honor me with her opinion. Let me offer you a sample. This is a work I particularly like. Takako. I'm so glad I found you. Why did you run away? I took the vows to be a servant of God. We need to talk. Please, let me talk to her. What are you doing? I'm asking you... Please forget all about me. Takako! Takako! Takako! You have to go now. Let me go! Takako! Let me go already! Takako! Takako! Let me go! Takako! He found me. He followed me. He came all the way. Please help me. I am a sinful woman. Takako, let's get married. Never. I'll keep my freedom. You have a wife and a kid. I'm leaving her. You can't do that. But... you make me happy. I like you. I won't forgive you. Akiko! I'll kill myself! - No! - Akiko! Oh Lord... Please forgive me. And so she chose to kill herself. Yes. Sister Maria. That man... do you still love him? I don't know. And that... is a source of sorrow. I'm suffering. It's painful. Please, drink this. This will assuage your grief. You'll get a good night's sleep. It hurts. Stop! A dream? Maria's Holy Heart Convent A place to live with God's kindness in an evil world. So you'll let me meet with Takako? Yes, you have my word. She'll meet you tonight at 7. What? You had that dream too? Right. We had the same dream. You're still hung up on men. Hey, ain't that great? Be careful. It's OK, don't worry. Look! Maria, you do it. Oh no, I can't. Of course you can. Look! See? Hey, Maria. How about a race back home? I'm taking that road down. Hey, sister. We could have a good time, you and me. - Great! - No! - No, stop it! - Come on! - Don't! - Wow! What a cute ass! - Hey! Hey! ' No! No! No! Stop! No! Look! If you don't stop fighting, I'll carve up your white skin. Alright! No! No! No! No, stop it! No, stop it! Where? Where are we going? A secret meeting place. You don't need to know. You've come to. We haven't done anything yet. We're not into 'sleeping beauties'. Look here! - Come on! - No! Hey! Here you go! Hey, sister. How about a blow job? - No. - Don't be so proud! I licked you well earlier. You return the favor. Come on! Thank you. We're not done with you! Young people are so full of energy. - Come on! Come on! - Stop it! No! No! No! We brought you Mr. Honda. Right, let him in. Look who's here. I'm glad you came. Takako! Stop it! What is this about? You mean sister Maria? I like that woman. I want to train her. You're crazy! No... No! What do you think this is? No! Stop it! No! See? I inserted this vibrator deep into her vagina. It gives her pleasure at will. An ingenious device. Please... Stop it! Please... Enough! Come, please. Hey, Kawabe. Feed her the object of your pride. I'm begging you! Please, take me. Please. I'm begging you. Wanna suck on this? - No! No! - Come on. No! You guys are crazy! You've gone crazy! We won't let you escape. Please! Open up! Please! Open up! Please open up! Yes. What happened so late? There are bad guys after me. - What? - Please help me! Please! I'm hot! Grab them! Grab them! Sister Maria! Maria! I didn't do anything. Sister Maria. Stop! Stop... Good! Good! No! Stop! Mr. Honda! Hey. Bring in the man. Yes. - Going to bed? - Yes. -You! ' No! Stop! What do you want? Are we both having the same dream? My room. No! No! No! Stop it! Takako. Mr. Honda. Water! Water, please! Does this guy even have balls? See how a woman like her endured pain better than you did. You're evil. Evil! You are! Who? Who is there? That device inside you... You want it out? Or do you want to keep it? Sister Cecilia? You're with them? Please, leave Takako alone. - Please. - No! Stop! ' Stop... ' No! Please stop... - You're hurting me! - Stop it... Stop it... No! Stop it... Stop it... Stop it... - You're hurting me. - Stop... No! Stop it... No! No! Please, don't look. Mr. Honda... Open your eyes. Look, you wanted to meet Maria. And here she is. This toy... Sorry, you'll have to keep it. Stop it! No... - The whip. - Yes. It's hot! Hot! Such fair skin... She's the ideal woman I was looking for. Your nectar... Shall we feed it to your thirsty lover? - Hey. - Yes. - Lick her! - No. Didn't you enjoy her many times already? No. She bravely endured all the tortures. Sister Cecilia, take him. I'm sure he will do it with you. Maria, look at them. Look at him... You used to love that man. Come on, look at them. See? Hey, look at them. No. So? Does it tease you? Would you find relief with a finger? Say: "I want you, Master." No, it's hot... You're warming up, right? Tell me you want me. I want you. Huh? Louder! I can't hear you. I want you... Master. Good girl. Maria, you're not a servant of Jesus anymore. From today, you are my servant. Now, you... are mine. Forever. Forever. Don't! Don't do it! If you disappear, he'll be all mine! I hate you. Because of your body... - I hate you. - Stop it! Run! Don't ever come near him again! You two just run away. Get out! Hurry! Stupid bitch! Why did you do that? Please! Please forgive me. Shut up and sit back. Hey! Hurry! There they are. Maria, my ideal woman... You thought I'd let you flee? Hey, you idiot! The wheel! THE END
