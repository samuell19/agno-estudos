No! Surge Fist! Surge Fist! LONDON Minister! Minister, can I take a picture of you? PIease Iook at this camera. This issue differs from others? -Yes. Minister, one more picture. -Minister. Minister, pIease. Minister, may I have your comment? The Minister of Justice, right? Minister! Get off me. The name of this terrorist is Cammy White. She is a speciaI agent who works for MI6. She is being interrogated at Base B, but she cIaims to have no memory of the past three years. Which means? She is being controIIed somehow. By examining our data on Cammy, we can teII that ShadowIaw is creating its own terrorists by manipuIating the victims' subconscious. We're trying to work out how that's being done. We detected that ShadowIaw must be gathering information on street fighters across the worId to produce a deadIy agent Iike Cammy. Street fighters becoming terrorists? This man, Sagat, a champion Muay Thai fighter, is adored in ThaiIand. This man, Bison, was banned from boxing for his vioIent temper. Then, this is a Spanish fighter, a savage psychopath, BaIrog. Vega has recruited them to be speciaI soIdiers for ShadowIaw. ShadowIaw's crimes are getting bigger and more daring. ShadowIaw must be destroyed immediateIy. We are going to conduct a joint investigation with the US miIitary. PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE Major GuiIe! Someone from InterpoI is here for you. InterpoI? I'm Chun-Li. -And? I am here to discuss the joint investigation into ShadowIaw. I am going to destroy Vega. What do you mean? It means I don't need any heIp to beat him. Major GuiIe. This is a decision made by US forces. The aim is to defeat Vega. We do our best. That's it. Welcome. -Show it to me now. CertainIy. This is a masterpiece of computer technoIogy, the uItimate high performance cyborg. The images it captures wiII be beamed to the super computer at headquarters via their sateIIite. I have aIready repIaced our oIder, obsoIete surveiIIance robots with this cyborg modeI. Good. Have you found the guy I'm Iooking for, by the way? Not yet. Anyone strong enough to beat up Sagat is someone I want to find. I am having my men get information on the fighters in each country. I wonder if this Ryu guy has as great a fighting capacity as the computer suggests. For any fighters, the vaIue of their potentiaI fighting capacity is rareIy more than 2000. I cannot beIieve the detected capacity was as high as 3600. Anyway, find him as quickIy as possibIe. Look everywhere. Send cyborgs everywhere. Look everywhere. Send cyborgs everywhere. Rising Dragon Fist. Ryu, what is it that you are staring at beyond your fist? OK. That's enough. Have a rest. Before breakfast, go and get some water from the vaIIey. Yes, Sensei. Idiot. Why didn't you hit me more? Are you going easy on me? Don't be stupid. I'd never go easy on you. I'm just kidding. You're so sensitive. WeII, we'II have to depend on fighting Iike this for reaI one day. SEATTLE Sorry I'm Iate. It is rare that you arrive Iate. The opponent was reaIIy tough, so it took me Ionger than expected. And how did you do? I won. -So you got another titIe, then? That's right. SUZHOU, CHINA Hey, isn't FeiIong here yet? We can't shoot a fiIm without the main actor. Strange. He Ieft for here ages ago. This is not funny. He's an idiot. Hey, FeiIong. -What's this? This is entertainment. -Entertainment? Some mouthy customer has been dragged into the ring now. I didn't say anything. -I heard you grumbIe, watching the game. You must be good at fighting as you were moaning about us. It Iooks interesting. I wonder why a famous actor Iike you Iikes watching fights in a dingy pIace Iike this. This new guy Iooks Iike a good fighter. -SeriousIy? Not bad. Your next opponent is me. You seem to be a good fighter. What's your name? My name is Ryu. I am just a Japanese traveIIer, watching a fight. No, you are not finished. I wiII show you! Get ready. FirebaII! Tornado WhirIwind Kick. UnbeIievabIe. Yes, I remember now. That's Ryu. He was the fighter who disappeared after beating the Muay Thai champion Sagat some years ago. You said you are Japanese and caIIed Ryu. You must be that Ryu. I heard Sagat was being trained by the ShadowIaw organisation. ShadowIaw? What's that? You don't know them? -No. It's a crime syndicate which distributes weapons and drugs aII over the worId. Sagat is in the crime syndicate... See you again, Ryu. NORTH SEATTLE Fight, Ken. I am here to chaIIenge you. You don't get it. I don't do street fights any more. It doesn't matter where a fighter fights. Oh, pIease. What's the point in fighting in such a street? You have obtained high titIes as a fighter. It is an honour for a fighter to defeat a man Iike you. That's a rubbish reason. And you are stupid forthinking you can beat me. No fighter can defeat me... except Ryu. Ryu? A drifting fighter who has been missing for some time? Don't compare such a IowIife with me. Watch out. When you ask for something, you just might get it. Rising Dragon Fist. What's wrong with you? Why don't you finish it? Ryu, where are you now? We have unfinished business. CALCUTTA Are you OK? Sorry. I see. That miIk was for your mother. Sorry. Can you buy some more with this? Here you are. Bring it on. Bastard. Wh... What the? I can't move. I can feeI a power. It's strong. Wait! I don't care if you win. The fight is over. What's with this attitude? It's because I feeI another power behind me. Are you trying to ruin the match by taIking rubbish? No, I don't care if you win. The fight is over. Then I wiII take the winnings. AII right. I've never feIt such a strong fighting power before. Bastard. Are you aII right? Who were they? -ShadowIaw terrorists. ShadowIaw? I have change to give back to you. -Don't worry about it. Thanks. Hey. HaIf of the winnings are yours. The cash? I might have Iost that fight if you hadn't been here. Keep it. We are both Japanese fighters. We shouId stick together. Are you sure you have eIiminated Yaha-n? Yes, no doubt about that. And in the place where he was killed, a monitor cyborg saw an unidentified fighter. lt's under investigation now. -What else? A monitor cyborg in Seattle has sent an interesting image to us and l would like to show it to you too. OK. I'm on my way. As you've asked me to come here, you must have got something good. Yes. Please take a look at this video clip. This man seems to be a very good fighter and l have found out something interesting. l placed the image of Ryu, who we are looking for, on this image. Who is this guy? -Ken Masters. We had data of his title match on the computer in headquarters, but we hadn't realised there was a relationship between them. What do you mean? Ken and Ryu were trained together under the same master in Japan. Their fighting ability is considered equal. -Equal? That doesn't mean their fighting potentiaIs are the same. We haven't got Ryu's current data yet. Either the previous data was collected wrongly by the computer or Ryu is witholding his full potential. I see. A fighter who was trained under the same master as Ryu... It might be interesting to use this guy Ken as a secret P Project weapon. Our master, Ed Pressman, may win the next presidential election. His strong support of the Weapon Control Bill exposes him to the threat of assassination. Our assassination plot against the president must be carried out without mistakes. It wiII be fine if we train this guy with my psycho power. But we shouldn't forget what happened with Cammy. She has achieved her purpose. She is being interrogated at the lnterpol base. I don't care about that. If herjob is finished, she's finished. We have also received a surveillance image of her interrogation at the lnterpol base. Show me. We know that you are a special agent for Ml6. l don't remember. We don't understand why you, an Ml6 agent, followed Shadowlaw's command to murder the Minister of Justice. l don't remember. Cammy, your mind was being controlled. We are trying to learn how your mind was controlled and where from. Try to remember. l don't remember anything. My psycho power won't be discovered by a system Iike InterpoI's. But if we leave her like this... We wiII eIiminate her Iater. In the meantime, continue searching for Ryu. Use any method to bring him here in front of me. Yes, Commander. Shall l tell North American agents to capture him? No, don't bother. It wiII be my pIeasure to pIan how to capture him. Why are you here? If you intend to investigate singIe-handed, it wiII breach the ruIes. Fussy woman. If you stand in my way, I wiII just run you over. Do as you Iike. Major GuiIe, I understand how you feeI. Your best friend was kiIIed by Vega. I see, and it's aIso InterpoI's job to invade other peopIe's privacy. Don't be offended, but I have gone through your fiIe. Sorry about your friend but you have to move beyond your vengeance. You won't be abIe to beat Vega just by being a gIib taIker. WouId you Iike to see how good I am as a fighter, then? I am too busy to waste time here. I aIso want to get revenge on Vega for murdering my father. But I am an agent of InterpoI. My duty as an agent comes before my own personaI feeIings. Major GuiIe, as an Air Force officer, you need to work with us. I'm not good with fussy women. Are you coming or what? How can I refuse such an invitation? LOS ANGELES Why are we going to a cIub? Are you Iooking for a cyborg? No, there is a pretty good fighter caIIed DJ there. Idiots Iike you wouIdn't understand my music. Go home. Bastard! I haven't done anything wrong. I am Major GuiIe, as Air Force officer. -What the heII do you want, Major?. Are you a fan or something? You are being watched by ShadowIaw. ShadowIaw the notorious crime organisation? I am honoured. I'm serious. If you get invoIved, you won't be abIe to go back to pIaying music anymore. I was just kidding. But what wouId they want with someone Iike me? They are gathering the information about famous fighters. That's none of my business. You don't understand. Your data has aIready been sent to ShadowIaw by this guy. What the heII is this monster? Is it some kind of tasteIess doII? It's a monitor cyborg, a surveiIIance device used by ShadowIaw. TeII your mates to be carefuI with these cyborgs around them. Major GuiIe... He is pIanning go against me and cooperate with InterpoI. Why don't you take care of this agent, Chun-Li? She is a pretty girI, isn't she? An agent who is hungry for revenge for the death of her father. Impressive, isn't it? Don't you think so, BaIrog? OK. Put me through to Las Vegas. OK. Put me through to Las Vegas. LAS VEGAS Nice to see you. -I am Iooking forward to it. Most of the bosses who secured the routes in each country are here. It's been fine. Yes, I wiII contact headquarters. CertainIy. The investigation has been intense IateIy. Is this trade going to be OK? I made the preparations myseIf. Did the 5000 get to London? PIease ask the commander-in-chief to contact me Iater on. CertainIy. Ladies and gentIemen. The fight wiII be starting shortIy. PIease come through to the haII. Ladies and gentIemen. The show is about to start. I wouId Iike to introduce today's fighters. The king of the Russian wrestIing worId, with an iron physique, Zangief! And his opponent is... BIanka, with a strange destiny, who brushed up on his skiIIs on his own by fighting against beasts in a deep jungIe. Ouch. NEW YORK That's strange. I thought she said she was heading home. l hear your voice far from where l am ln the dream l had last night lt's only the promise that hasn't changed... Shit. How unIucky am I? l can still hear it in the distance l am continuing on an endless journey Looking for the spirit l almost lost l will look ahead to tomorrow shining bright And keep on waking... You are BaIrog. ReaIIy strange. I've got a bad feeIing about this. Pick up the phone. Where should l go? What? Chun-Li? I Iike stripping the skin off a rabbit sIowIy after cornering it. My hand is thirsty for bIood, especiaIIy that of a pretty rabbit. Spinning Bird Kick. My... my beautifuI face... I'II make you suffer! Damn. Chun-Li! Are you aII right, Chun-Li? BaIrog was here. SeriousIy? And what about BaIrog? In the New York PoIice Department? We are tracing monitor cyborgs now. They have been detected around Ken Masters in SeattIe, who owns the titIe of MartiaI Arts Tournament Champion. Yes. UnIike nameIess street fighters, he is a powerfuI fighter, so I beIieve that Vega wiII definiteIy approach to him. There is another guy caIIed Ryu who was a feIIow pupiI of Ken. We are Iooking for him now, and we have received inteIIigence that a guy matching his description is heading into ThaiIand from India. Good. Check on Ryu too. I am worried about Chun-Li's condition, so I wiII stay in the hospitaI for a whiIe. As soon as the situation improves here, I wiII fIy to SeattIe and see Ken Masters. PIease get the information on Ken ready. LAKE WASHINGTON EIiza. Let's get married. Right this minute? Don't you want to? -Of course I want to. It's just that you've never taIked about this kind of stuff before. So Iet's do it, then. But... But what? It's compIeteIy out of the bIue. Has something happened to you? -Nothing speciaI. A man wishing for love Taking no risks He would be upset And back away from getting hurt l want to live in agony as if it were bare skin Cut and grazed by fresh summer leaves ln the wind Even if you get hurt, raise the fighting sprit Dear someone l haven't met... You seem different today, Ken. Sorry. Thank you. I wiII consider your proposaI. EIiza. -I Iove you. CaII me Iater. Ryu. I am tired of waiting for you. Commander, l have detected the target. Good, get closer. Bastard. What the? You are Ken Masters, aren't you? I have come to for you For me? Who the heII are you? I am the commander-in-chief of ShadowIaw, Vega. Vega? Never heard of you! What do you want? I'm going to make you into a powerfuI fighter. You're giving me the creeps. Get away from me! I wiII turn you into a better fighter than Ryu. What? Ryu? You know Ryu? You hear the name ''Ryu'' and finaIIy you take notice. Shut up! I've had enough of this! What do you intend to do with me, you freak? What do you caII that move? It is no use trying to resist, I possess psycho power. Psycho power? Submit and obey me - Lord Vega. No way! Submit. On a coId day in heII! You don't get it, do you? Surge Fist! You're quite a fighter. I'm Iooking forward to training you to be a reaI fighter. I'm Iooking forward to training you to be a reaI fighter. Why have you taken the troubIe to come and see Ken Masters? Ken is being targeted by Vega. Is it Ken's car? Yes, there's no doubt. Damn it, we're too Iate. INTERPOL, NEW YORK BRANCH These are ShadowIaw's bases in various countries that we have identified so far and the distribution of monitor cyborgs. No base was found near SeattIe, apart from a warehouse for arms and drugs. If Ken has been taken, it wiII certainIy be to the same pIace that Vega trained the other fighters. Any info on such a pIace? We haven't found the training base yet but ShadowIaw's major command centres are concentrated in southeast Asia. Major GuiIe... speaking of southeast Asia, we've estabIished the whereabouts of Ryu, Ken's feIIow fighter under the same master. He's the fighter who was in India. Where is he? In ThaiIand, in the mountainous area cIose to the border with Laos. Have monitor cyborgs been reported there? Yes, we've detected severaI, but he has been moving around a Iot, from China to India to ThaiIand and his motives or aims for moving are unknown so it doesn't seem IikeIy a cyborg is foIIowing him. But statisticaIIy it seems that Ryu is a fighter of equaI strength to Ken. There is no way that Vega has not got his eye on him. Right. We'II approach Ryu first so we are there when ShadowIaw makes contact. By the way, has a pIan been formed forthe InterpoI-US miIitary operation to eIiminate ShadowIaw? We have aIready got most of ShadowIaw's main bases. We are secretIy pIanning a concentrated attack by the SpeciaI Forces on his command centres in southeast Asia, especiaIIy those bordering Cambodia. Chun-Li, I've finaIIy Iocated Vega's headquarters. I'II avenge you and Dad at the same time, with my own hands. I'm sure you wanted to kiII Vega with your own hands too but Ieave this one to me, and get yourseIf better. I'm going now. Ken, the source of your fighting power is your competitive feeling towards Ryu. That's very useful! l will amplify that rivalry between you with psycho power. Ryu! Ryu, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. OK, one more time? Major GuiIe. We wiII shortIy be approaching the mountainous area aIong the Laos border. AII right. Lord Vega, I have just been informed that a miIitary heIicopter with GuiIe aboard is heading for the Thai-Laos border. It seems he has discovered the whereabouts of Ryu. GuiIe is heading to where Ryu is? I get it, he is trying to get there ahead of me, huh? This is getting interesting. I wiII head out there with Ken. But Ken is not yet compIeteIy... It doesn't matter. I am mereIy Ietting two rivaIs fuIfiI their destinies as fighters. I'II aIso bring Ryu back at the same time. Get ready straight away. Yes, Commander. Lord Vega, pIease Iet me fight Ryu. Sagat, you are a vaIuabIe ShadowIaw fighter. Forget about a grudge from combat. But if I can't fight Ryu again, my honour... ''The honour of a fighter''? So petty. Your opponent is the worId now. But... The ruIes of ShadowIaw state that you are not permitted to answer back to my orders. You shouId know that. I have a different order for you. FIy to New York immediateIy and eIiminate BaIrog and Cammy. ShadowIaw does not forgive mistakes. THE MOUNTAINS OF THAILAND Hey, Ryu. Let's take a break and have some tea. Yeah. Looks Iike the weather's going to turn. What's that? Visitors this deep in the mountains, eh? You're Ryu, Ken's friend, aren't you? That's right, but who are you? I am GuiIe, from the US Air Force. Has something happened to Ken? He has been abducted by a criminaI organisation caIIed ShadowIaw. By ShadowIaw? He is about to be used as a terrorist. There's no way Ken wouId assist a criminaI organisation. His mind is being controIIed. Ken, a terrorist... It's Vega's. What? -We have a Iot of visitors today. A rough visitor! Ken! You've appeared at Iast, Vega. It's been a Iong time, Major GuiIe. AII the actors are here and now we have the perfect stage. You! What do you intend to do with Ken? Are you Ryu? I have had Ken become a fighter for ShadowIaw in your pIace. You! Let him go! Ryu! Ken... Ken! How's that, Ryu? Ken is now a kiIIing machine that I created. Can you defeat him? Ken, it's me, Ryu! I'm afraid Ken can no Ionger hear his friend's voice. He is a machine that operates soIeIy in order to defeat you. Snap out of it, Ken! Vega, I can't Iet someone Iike you have your own way. Your sense of justice, huh? GuiIe, it is the eviI mind that is the source of aII power. Ken here wiII demonstrate that for you. It's quickerjust to do him in than to Iisten to his speech. Here I come! Who the heII are you? Your opponent wiII be me! GuiIe, why don't you see if you can defeat me? Ready and waiting! Ken, it's me, wake up! Ken! It's me, Ryu! PIease snap out of it, Ken! What's up, GuiIe? Don't you want to avenge your best friend? So come on then! You can't fooI me twice. Sonic boom! That's feebIe! Wait. We haven't settIed the contest yet. Wake up, Ken. I don't want to fight with you when you're Iike this. Wake up! Ken... It's me, Ryu! Take a good Iook at me! Ken! Ryu... Ken. You faiIure. Stop it! Ken! Damn you. Get out of my way! So you want to take me on? This is getting interesting. Let's see what yourfighting abiIity is reaIIy Iike. Shut up and get out of my way! AII taIk and no action - hurry up and defeat me so you can save your friend. Out of my way! Right, I'II be off. Right, take care. I'II Ieave the mountains in two or three days too. UntiI we meet again. UntiI we meet again. l'm looking forward to that day... Damn it! Ryu, how about you submit to me and become ShadowIaw's chosen warrior? You've got to be joking! I wouId never be your minion! I see you stiII have the strength to resist me. You're something! Shut up! Fight! Are you going? Yes. I hate to go now but I must Ieave. One day you wiII no doubt face an opponent whom you must defeat in the sense beyond that of winning or Iosing. The meaning of training is to progress aIong the path toward that day. ''Beyond winning or Iosing''? Sensei, what do you mean by ''beyond winning or Iosing''? Sensei! That is something I wiII teach you! Why? What happened? I can't remember. What's happened to my body? Damn it. That's... I know... That's that freak's craft... I remember now... Ryu! It's him... Vega! Ryu! Damn it! Condition your breath and mind. Take in the sun for the power of life. Train your spirit to produce God. Discipline God to reach nihility. Relax your neck, but keep your head up. Relax your chest, but straighten your back. Relax your waist. Let your moves flow. Keep your shoulders relaxed. Use your spirit, not power. Harmonise your upper and lower body. Let your hands and feet flow. Seek for silence in moves. External style, then internal energy. Feel energy circulate in your body. Mastering Yin and Yang produces a master. Then the master produces power. Master firmness, then reach softness. Master softness, then firmness will be produced. Ken! lt is a question of what you see beyond your fist. Ken! Wake up! Ryu... What's up? Show your strength more! K... Ken! Ryu, we meet again at Iast. We'II say our greetings properIy Iater. First we destroy that monster! So you want to fight Lord Vega no matter what? Very weII. I'II fight you on your own IeveI. Come on! Posters at a street corner fade away Without attracting anyone's attention... You struck me, huh? You're both worthy of my rating you so highIy. But surely my love for you Won't go away... Come on, give me more. Still stay firmly inside me l wish l could see you Even by chance But l want to tell my feelings to you... What's up? Come on, give me more! Missing you, longing for you and this feeling encourages me That's what l always feel about you l am walking towards you You go forward without fear l try not to show my tears l just want to keep watching you This Ryu is something. He got to me, the great Lord Vega, even though it was for a mere moment... Vega! Ken, now! Tornado WhirIwind Kick. Rising Dragon Fist. This is mine! Surge Fist. Major Guile? -Yes. This is New York Central Hospital. Please come to the hospital as a matter of urgency. Chun-Li. Look where you're going! Chun-Li! Chun-Li! Chun-Li... Chun-Li... I avenged you good and proper, Iike I promised you. I know! ''The InterpoI-US miIitary Joint Operation to Destroy ShadowIaw Succeeds.'' You did it, GuiIe! You tricked me! Sorry! I won't forgive you! Sorry! -You! Ryu... Next time we meet we've got an oId score to settIe. Yeah. Want a Iift? No... I'II waIk. Where wiII you go now? Who knows. You've become strong, Ryu. You too. See you. Huh? Good luck - that is all l can say right now l cannot say anything else Fine day - it's a very fitting anniversary day For setting out on a journey Back then l did not understand that The unknown of tomorrow is a freedom And l ran alone through the dark Trying to conquer that unknown The lonely journey to overcome the grey wall What are you seeing in your heart? ls the destination named ''love'' Shining bright to you right now? ln that place there will be our paradise Even hurt and sadness would be blown away there Good luck - l believe in you One day l realised that l love you But l could not voice it And watched you walk away The earth will not stop spinning Because love will continue to turn it l wanted to hear your heartbeat for myself By resting my cheek on your chest A lonely dream of flying over the seven-hued seas My blood is racing through my whole body ls the terminus named ''love'' Giving you peace in your heart right now? ln that place there will be our paradise Even hurt and sadness would be blown away there Good luck - l believe in you One day l realised that l love you One day for certain l will reply with a smile
