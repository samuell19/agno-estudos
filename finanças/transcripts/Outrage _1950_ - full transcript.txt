Two pieces of chocolate cake please, to go. Hey beautiful, what's this "two pieces of chocolate cake" routine every day? I've been here almost a week and every day it's the same thing. Either you're nuts about cake or you've got a boyfriend. If I was your boyfriend, you wouldn't have to buy me no cake. You'd better make up your mind. I might be moving on next week. How about it, beautiful? Hey, honey! Over here. Hi. Sorry I'm late. I couldn't find you. Oh, that's alright. Somebody else got our bench. ─ Oh. Been waiting long? ─ No. Just seemed that way. Open it up, I'm starving. ─ Me too. Mice? I couldn't wait. A couple of little ones in there for you. Thanks. Lunch is on me tomorrow, and I'll be here first. Today I brought dessert. ─ Never mind that. Something happened this morning. ─ Hmm? Something important. ─ Well tell me. I .. I got the raise. Ten dollars? Ten whole dollars, honey. Count 'em. ─ A week? And there's 52 weeks in a year. Shine, mister? Beat it will you, sonny. I'm busy. How are you going to get anywhere with a dame with shoes like that? Blow. I'm doing just fine thank you, now run along will you. Okay, if you want to look like a slob. You look great to me. That's what I've been waiting to hear. Look, you know what that ten bucks means, don't you? It means the Benton Auto Supply Company knows a good man when they see one. I wish something like that would happen to me. Honey, this is what we've waited for. You can quit your job, we can get that apartment we were looking at. We don't have to wait any longer. And listen. Listen. You and I have been going together for long enough. I was hoping you'd say that. Well .. We'll tell mother and Dad tonight. You can come to dinner. Oh honey, couldn't you just tell them? You know what will happen. I'll just get to the point and your Dad starts talking about geometry. And I'm dead. I'll tell you what. You go in and soften them up first, and then I'll come in later. Oh don't worry about him, darling. It's just that .. He's a teacher and takes things seriously and .. I know your Dad and believe me he'll blow .. You will come to dinner, won't you? We're going to have fried chicken and .. I'm going to make the gravy. Oh, brother. Okay. We can't do anything now. I'll help you with the dishes, mother. ─ No, we leave everything on the table. It isn't every night we have you children with us. Ann, will you help me with this? ─ Oh, sure. You wind. ─ Okay. Gee, it's a bright color. You know, I was going to get green and then I thought .. As I was saying. My students may not like me. But I try to gain their respect. Yes sir, I understand. Well, after all, it's quite important. Yes, of course. You were a student of mine once, James. Geometry one. Do you suffer? No, sir. Not much. Just at the end. At the end? Well yes, you flunked me. But I'm a lot brighter now, sir. Well of course you are, dear. Yes. Yes, he's .. He's so bright that .. He got a raise. Yes, I'm up to 90 a week now, sir. ─ I'll let you in on an open secret. You earn more than I do. However I suppose there are compensations. Like watching Ann grow up. If she could only have gone to college. College is alright, Mr Walton, but there are other things. You know. I always wanted Ann to become a teacher. There is a crying need for young people to replace us older educators. Overcrowded schools, classes too large. Ann showed great promise in high school, especially in mathematics. Yes, but there are other things, Mr Walton. For instance? ─ Like marriage. Marriage? Mr Walton, I'm sure it comes as no great surprise. I want to marry Ann. But this is wonderful. When have you planned it? ─ Right away. I don't want Stella Carter or some other female to steal him away from me. There is nobody in the world I would rather have for a son than you. Oh, Daddy. Don't look so sad. Only one woman to henpeck you. You're both very young for marriage. Oh no we're not, Daddy. Really we're not. Ann, come here. I want to hug both of you. Well, congratulations, Jim. Have a long, happy life together. ─ Thank you, sir. Good morning, Andy. ─ Good morning, Ann. Well, aren't you the happy little worker this morning. Oh, I certainly am. Any particular reason? Uhuh. There are sixty million men in this country and I found the right one. Don't be so sure. Hi, Andy. ─ Hi. How about lunch today with Eve and me. Oh, I can't. I got a date. It seems to me you have a date just about every day. Well I do, but this one is a special date. Why? I'm going to a finger fitting. ─ Which one? This one. Oh Ann! I'm so excited. Let's sneak out later and have coffee and talk about it. Okay. ─ Good. Congratulations. ─ Thanks. Did Stella try to hook you for overtime work? She not only tried, but did. It's alright. Jim's working late anyhow. Hmm. We'd better get back. What's the hurry? You're the one who's getting married. I need my job. A cup of coffee, please. How about a cup of coffee? Goodnight, Mara. ─ Goodnight, honey. Hey! Beautiful! Hey! Hey! [ Whistle ] [ Whistle ] [ Whistle ] Please! Please, somebody help me! Taxi! Taxi! [ Car horn. Loud ] Ann. Ann. What's happened to you? Tell me. What's happened to you? Ann, what's the matter? Tell me what's the matter, dear. How is she? She needs a good night's rest. I've given her a mild sedative. This is Dr Hoffman. Sergeant Hendricks and Mrs Miller of Police Headquarters. They're here to see Ann. The girl is in a state of shock. Couldn't you wait until tomorrow? If we can find where it happened, and get a full description of the man .. We may pick him up tonight. I don't believe she's in any condition. But I suppose you have to. Mrs Miller, would you go up please. You'd better get some sleep, Eric. There is nothing you can do. Please don't worry. I'll stay here. I'll stand by upstairs. Tonight my daughter was brutally attacked. Why don't you do something about preventing crimes like these? We try to do all we can, but we're only dog catchers. We pick up cases like this every day. Slap them in jail. After that, I don't know what happens. I don't make the laws. I only enforce them. As soon as we get some facts from your daughter, we'll go right to work. Is this why you raise a daughter? Is this what you loved and sacrificed for? What kind of times are these that such things can happen? Only this morning, she was carefree and happy and now .. Sorry. That's alright. Go ahead. When did you first notice the man following you? When did you first notice him? I kept walking. Faster and faster. I couldn't get away. I couldn't get away. What did he look like? Can you tell me what he looked like? I never saw his face. Only the scar on his neck. And his leather jacket and him coming closer. I couldn't move. I couldn't move! How tall was he, dear? Please. No more. Get Dr Hoffman. Ann, you must eat something. They are all staring at this house. They're whispering. All day they've been looking up. Ann, people are sorry about what happened. I'm going back to work tomorrow. If they want to stare, let them have a good look. Jim's been here twice. He called again a little while ago. He wants to come over. No. I can't see him. ─ Oh, but dear. I don't want to see him. "Police round up suspects in unsolved Walton case." How is she? ─ She's nearly ready. I wish she wouldn't go to work today. I'm afraid. Eric, it's something she wants to do. She says she has to face it sometime. Yes. I guess she'll have to face the same thing I did yesterday in my class. They stared at me as though I were some kind of curiosity. It was a nightmare. Even some of the other teachers looked at me as if I had done something. I wish she'd let me drive her to work. Eric, let her do as she wants. Oh good morning, darling. Ann, are you sure you don't want me to drive you? No .. I'll be fine. Be sure to call me at noon, dear. Good morning, Annie. That's a nice dress you've got on. Thanks. How are your mother and father? They are fine, thank you. ─ That's good. Oh. Go on .. take a good look. Go on, all you! Annie, cut it out. We understand. Nobody is staring at you. Come on. Let's go get a drink of water. Miss Walton. I'd like you to come to headquarters. We've picked up some men. It won't do you any good. I didn't see his face. I'm sorry. You will have to come along. Have a seat. Take your time, Miss Walton. Remove your hats. Look them over carefully. Scar. Left profile. Right profile. That look like him, Miss Walton? I don't know. Next. Scar. Left profile. Right. How about him? I can't remember. Next. Left profile. Right. Is that the man, Miss Walton? I can't remember. I can't. That's alright. Take your time. I don't know. I can't. I can't. Try to concentrate, Miss Walton. Try to remember. We don't want this man on the streets tonight. Try to remember. Does that look like the man, Miss Walton? Let's see the scar. How about him? Try to remember. Next. Scar. Next. Try to remember. Right .. left. Right. Scar. Left. Left. Right. Right. Scar. Left. Right. Left. Scar. Next. Scar. Left. Please, she's had enough. That's all. Look .. nothing matters except us. You know that, don't you? We'll get married this weekend. I've got it all planned. There is a little place over at the state line. Ann. I'm asking you to marry me. Now. Or didn't you hear me? Yes, I heard. Well? No! Ann! I can't. I can't! ─ Come here. Let me go. ─ Don't talk like that. We're going to be married, right away. I want you. I want to live with you. I want to have kids with you. We can be happy like other people. We're not like other people. I don't want to get married, ever. I don't want you to touch me. Everything is dirty! Filthy and dirty! Ann, listen! We can live away from here. Somewhere else if that would help. Sure. You've seen them staring at me, wondering, talking. Yes, we could run, but not far enough. ─ Shut up! And you'd always be thinking about what happened. You would never forget! ─ Shut up! Ann. Here you are, sir. Los Angeles, return. Where to, please? Los Angeles. ─ Round trip? Round trip? Are you coming back? "We'll get married this weekend." "I've got it all planned. There is a little place over the State line." "Somewhere else, if that would help." "No, we could run, but not far enough." I've got it all planned. There's a little place over the State line." [ Radio: ] "In Sacramento the State Assembly committee met this afternoon."

You're at the Harrison ranch. I'm sure you can stay here tonight. You'll be alright. No, I .. I must be going. You can get a lift down to the bus-stop tomorrow. My name is Bruce Ferguson. Mine is .. Ann Blake. Where were you going? When I found you. I don't know. Los Angeles, I guess. Can I .. help you in any way? Well, I see she's awake. Ah, this is Mrs Harrison. ─ Hello. Take a sip of this. You'll feel better. I think she sprained her ankle. ─ I'll take care of it. Fine. I'll leave you two alone. We'll take that shoe off and look at your foot. There now. Oh, hello Tom. Sorry I missed the excitement, Doc. The girl only has a sprained ankle. Madge did an expert job of taping it up. Did you find out anything about her? Not very much I'm afraid. Except she's a frightened kid. She says she's on her way to Los Angeles. Where is she from? I don't know. We maybe ought to report her to the police. Oh, I don't think it's that serious. Of course, if you'd rather I took her with me ..? No .. let her stay here for now. We'll put her on the bus in the morning. You're really one Doc for picking up strays. Well, I guess that's part of my job. When are you going to put some tobacco in that pipe? Here. No thanks. I just like to chew on it. Well. Goodnight. Goodnight, Doc. Oh .. Thanks for being so hospitable. Goodnight. Goodnight, Bruce. Say, Doc. About church next Sunday. I'll be there. If I can catch up on my accounts. ─ Yeah? I'll believe that when I see it. So long. ─ So long. Well, hello. Good morning, Ann. How do you feel? Oh, I'm alright. You can go back on the bus that brings the workers up from town. Ever see an orange-packing plant before? Well, you're seeing one at the height of the season. Is this one of the new packers? No, just a guest. She's leaving when the bus gets here. Too bad, boss. We're going to be two packers short today. A couple of girls quit. Well, get some more. ─ I'm trying. But there are other ranches hiring, too. What do packers do? They work in there. Wrapping and crating. It's easy. It pays 18 cents a box. You'd make a buck and a quarter an hour. Interested? I don't know. In that case, you're hired. Okay, boss? Sure. I guess so. There's a rumor that a man can get an orange in this place. Thank you. You know, I didn't expect to find you here. Glad you decided to stay around. How do you like it? It's alright. You're new at this kind of work, aren't you? What did you do before? I was a secretary bookkeeper. Does Tom Harrison know that? You know, you'd be more help n the office than right here. Don't bother. I'll be leaving in a few days. They might even let you stay in Louise's room. That's their daughter. She's married now. No, I can't stay here. Los Angeles? I guess so. Your family live there? Are you sure I can't help you? No, but .. No, but .. But thank you for everything you've done. Mr Harrison called you "Doc". Are you a doctor? Yes, I'm a doctor. Perhaps, not the kind you are thinking of. Not in these clothes anyway. I have a little church in Santa Paula. I've .. I've got to get my lunch. Excuse me. Gin. Anybody home? Hide the cards, Lee. It's the vicar himself. Hello, Tom. ─ Doc. Relax, Lee. It's a good game running. I'm not so sure. I'm losing. How are you, Madge? ─ Fine, Bruce. How about a cup of coffee? ─ No thanks. Where is Ann? ─ Out in the office. Working on a Saturday afternoon? She's always working. It wasn't my idea, Doc. She just wants to work. I can't stop her. But she's put all my books in order. Tell me, Bruce. Have you found out anything more about Ann? No. Not very much. I hope it's alright her working in the office, handling the payroll money. She seems alright. I was hoping you'd accept her. If you don't want to, I'll .. Find some other way of helping her. Take it easy, Doc. Your word is good enough for me. Thanks. Oh .. and by the way. Save me a seat next Sunday. Hello, Ann. I didn't mean to .. scare you so. How is everything going? Oh, fine. I like it here. Thanks for getting me the job. Tom Harrison doesn't beat you, does he? Feeds you enough? He's nice. Don't you think you ought to close down the books for today? After all, I didn't send you into slavery, you know. Oh .. I've got lots to do. It's too nice a day for this sort of thing. I'm going to a little place that I know. To do some sketching. I thought maybe you'd like to come along for the ride. No, I don't think so. You've no idea how .. Peaceful it is. I go there every Saturday. Well now, isn't this better than a column of figures? Oh, it's pretty. I used to roam for miles over this part of the country when I was a boy. This is my favorite place. I waited for the buffalo to come down and graze. But they never did. That's because there were not buffalo. Come on, now. I've got a little hideaway to show you. This is my secret hiding place. You know, whenever I'd done anything wrong, I used to .. Go scampering up that hill there like a scared rabbit. Then I'd get hungry and it would start getting late and I'd sneak back home. Come on, let's sit down. May I see the sketch? It's good. It's only half finished. Have you always lived here? I was born in Santa Paula. My father was in the church too. He was transferred from Philadelphia when I was ten. It took me 25 years to get back here. You see, I was looking for something. It's hard to put into words. You might call it "faith". Sometimes, it's difficult to hold on to. You mean ..? You stopped believing? We all go through dark times. Mine was a year in a hospital after the war. You see, I was in .. The Navy. Navy chaplain. Italy. Wound up with one lung. TB. But the thing that .. Hurt the most was being told that I couldn't go back to my church. There was so much I wanted to do. So you came back here? ─ Uhuh. I was feeling pretty sorry for myself. You know, I shouldn't be telling you this. Ministers of the church aren't supposed to waiver or doubt. But being human, we do. Do you know something else? When I came back to this valley where'd been so happy as a boy. I found it as lovely as ever. I looked deep down at myself. And then. Up at the sky. Suddenly I found myself. My faith. It was the most wonderful feeling I've ever known. Sorry to have gone on like this. But I wanted you to know, that you're not alone. I'll never forget this place. Not as long as I live. Ann, we all need help some times. I want to help you. Looks like we'll have four or five truckloads ready to go. That's the way I figure it. Well, I'll go and check. Good. Where have you been, Doc? Thought you'd given us up for heathens. I've been kinda busy. We're going up in the world. The Bishop paid me a visit last week. He wanted to know if I was strong enough to take a church up north. What did you tell him? I told him not yet. That .. I had some work to do here. Meaning me, I suppose? Yeah, meaning you. Just keep on needling me, Doc. Now look, next Sunday for sure. Alright. You know, I believe in miracles. Hello, Charlie. Say, what have I done? You haven't done anything. How are you? ─ Hi, Sheriff. ─ Dr Ferguson. I can vouch for both of us. Put on any new help lately? Well a few more pickers .. Mostly people who've been around here for years. I'm sorry, Sheriff. This is Ann. Ann Blake. You're new here, young lady? Kinda shy, isn't she? Tom, come on into the office. I want to ask you a couple of questions. Oh Tom, just a moment. I'd like to come along. Hello? No Madge, she hasn't turned up here. Lee's looked everywhere on the ranch. I was kinda getting used to her here in Louisa's room. Yes, I know. Please let me hear if you .. find her. Goodbye. Come in, Ann. One of the boys on my ship wrote it. I'm glad you didn't do anything foolish, Ann. The Sheriff wasn't looking for you. How about some coffee? I'll get a cup. Sit down. My name isn't Blake. No? I ran away from home. I had to. Don't you think you ought to let your family know where you are? No. I want to stay here. Ann, we all have to stop running sometime. We have to face ourselves. And look at the world all over again. You know, that second look after a heartache. Shows up some wonderful things. Now come on, let me see you smile. That's better. You know, Saturday is our big harvest dance. We always have lots of fun. You will come, won't you? Why, you'll like it. Don't worry. I'll be there. I guess I'd better take you back to the ranch. Let me taste that stuff. Why can't you make punch like that? I did. Hello, Lee. This is about your fifth time around, isn't it? I've got an awful thirst. ─ You know, this is pure orange juice? Yeah. Hello, Marilyn, Joseph. Congratulations on the addition to the family. Punch? There you are. Enjoy yourselves. Hello, pretty one. Think you could put up with me for the next waltz? I don't like to dance. Don't. ─ Oh, come on. Look, just one little waltz. ─ No! Let me go. Don't. Why do you wear it this way? It's so pretty when it's undone. Get away from me. You know, ever since you came to this place, I've wanted to do this. You're beautiful. ─ No. What's the matter? I'll not hurt you. I just want to kiss you. Is that bad? Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Afraid Bruce Ferguson might find out? Don't .. don't! He's kept you pretty much a secret, hasn't he. We'd like to know where you came from and why. Don't. Don't. Don't! Don't what? Why can't I kiss you? You're the prettiest girl around here. Ann! Ann! Ann. Why, Ann? Why did you do it, Ann? Why? We have to go back now. They are waiting for you. Yeah? Alright, thanks. Do you think you take an awful long chance sometimes? I mean with these characters you collect. What did you find out? They traced her through the Missing Person's Bureau. A hunch that paid off. Her name is Ann Walton. She been missing from home for a couple of months. A victim of a criminal assault. Go on. That's about all. Look, I'm sorry. There is nothing I can do. Frank is lying over at the hospital in bad shape. He might not pull through. Even if he does, she's in trouble. Can I see her? I guess so. Ann. I know. What happened, I know. Tell me, why did you try to kill Frank? I've known him for a long time. He meant you no harm. I could see him coming closer. And closer. And I screamed. I could see a scar on his neck. I could feel the leather jacket. Frank doesn't have a scar on his neck. He wasn't wearing a leather coat. Yes. A leather coat. Once I got away from him. And he couldn't find me behind one of the trucks. There weren't any trucks. Not at the dance. You picked up a wrench. He wore a leather coat. Now I think I understand. You are innocent. So awfully innocent. I pray to God they'll understand that. Frank Marini was strong enough to sign this affidavit this morning. I must say your friend Marini is a forgiving man. A very unusual document. Mr Marini's refusal to press charges against Miss Walton doesn't alter facts. She almost murdered a man. Judge. Mr Porter. I'm not a lawyer or a psychiatrist. Except as a man's religious faith .. Allows him to look into the heart and mind of another. Are we all agreed that Miss Walton was suffering a form of temporary insanity? Yes. Ann has been suffering in her mind a long time. Ever since she was the victim of a vicious criminal attack. The kind that is a shameful blot on our towns and cities. What happened here. Began two months ago in Capital City. An evil chain reaction. Which deluded Ann into believing that .. Frank Marini was the man who attacked her. This morning, I called Capital City. The police told me that they'd found the man two days ago. He was arrested while attempting an armed robbery. Later, he .. Confessed to the assault on Ann. They ..? They arrested him? Yes, Ann. That still doesn't answer the charge against Miss Walton. This man. This criminal. Has spent half of his life. Half of his life. In reform schools or prisons for acts of violence. He was always punished. But he was never treated as a neurotic individual. Never treated as a sick man. So he was released uncured. And Ann Walton was the victim of his fury. I regret that such men are turned back into society. But this hearing is concerned with Miss Walton's innocence or guilt. That's my point. She is innocent of criminal intent. And we are guilty of criminal negligence. It's our fault. All of us. Our generation has produced too many neuroses. Too many mentally displaced people right here at home. We need .. we need more hospitals, more clinics. More trained men to turn human scrap .. Back into useful human beings. Mr Porter. I appeal to you as a man, not as a prosecutor. I'd like you to ask the judge to dismiss the complaint. Against Ann Walton. You Honor, I .. I hereby move that the complaint against Miss Walton .. Be dismissed. Before I can render a decision, there is one question that must be answered. What assurance do we have .. That Miss Walton's temporary delusions may not return? Wouldn't it be better if she were placed for treatment in a proper institution? Until pronounced fit to resume a normal life. I don't know. But I feel that Ann needs people who love her. As much as she needs psychiatric treatment. The court recognises your generous feelings. But cannot accept your testimony as that of an expert witness. This hearing will be adjourned until such time as a competent psychiatrist .. Can examine Miss Walton. Why don't they just take me away and lock me up? ─ Ann. Don't ever give up hope. I don't know. Maybe I am crazy. Sometime I feel as if the whole world is upside down. The judge said we wouldn't have to wait very long. You're the only one who can help me. Why don't they understand? Why? Miss Walton. The examining psychiatrist says you are still far from well. But he does not believe institutional care is required. He does however, strongly recommend .. That you receive psychiatric treatment for a period of at least one year. I will favorably consider a motion for dismissal. Providing Dr Ferguson guarantees the court .. That Miss Walton will undertake the necessary treatment. I'll gladly accept responsibility. We'll have a written report from the psychiatrist the first of every month. Miss Walton. Good luck. Good luck. Thank you. It's so lovely. And I make it sound so awful. I could still recognise it. I talked to your mother and father. When? While you were saying goodbye to Frank at the hospital. I told them everything was alright with you. They want to come and get you. They love you. More than you know. Must I go home? Now? Please. Please let me stay here with you. Near you. Jim is waiting, too. He mustn't wait. Not for me. You loved him, didn't you. And he loved you. You'll find it is still that way. But I could help you here. Mr Harrison might let me stay on. Things might be difficult at first, I know. But you'll find your way. I'll never forget you. You've made me very happy. Made you happy? Are you needing me? I'm watching you get ready to start life all over again. Then you don't want me to stay? Is that it? You've a life to go back to. I've a job to do. One of these days I'll be leaving here, too. No-one can turn their backs on what they're meant to do. People who mean something to each other. Never say goodbye. Not really. I suppose that's because they're never completely apart. No matter how many miles or years separate them. Then I will see you sometime? Of course. For friends .. True friends .. It's a very small world. Tell Jim from me. He's a lucky fellow. Ann, why are you crying? Because you understand everything. You understand me. It's nearly five. We'd better be going or you'll miss the bus. It's due any minute. Ann. You're going to have ä wonderful, happy life. Thank you. Thank you for everything. You'll only have about añ hour's wait in Los Angeles. Then you'll be on your way East. Here it is. T-G
