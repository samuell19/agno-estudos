But I have no medicine for their secret wounds. And yet there was a time, golden in its way, when we all seemed... Well, happy is not a word I care to use now.

You need my permission to shoot on these lands. - And i’m the owner of meself. Your agent lets me shoot. - My agent? Mr. Sweeney? - It’s a little present for you. - Come on. There. - Oh, my god. - Can’t stand the sight of blood? Odd for a doctor. - Blood should be invisible, particularly to a man in my condition. So biddy tells me you’ve been up since dawn, for god’s sake. - Oh, long before. Woke up with a mouth like a ditch. The moon was up, a hunter’s moon. Such wonderful nights we have here. - God, you’re a terrifying woman, Agnes. Aren’t you afraid the bogeyman will get you? - Just because i’m a woman doesn’t mean I have to be frightened.

I’m sorry if I was rude to you today. I didn’t know who you were. I hope you can forgive me. - Don’t talk nonsense, man. You said you came here on business. What is it? - I want to rent the scraw.

Put in a word for me with the bitch. - What kind of word? - A soft word. A soft hand under the hen. - Soft words cost money. - Mr. Lynchehaun, I don’t recall giving you permission to open a shop. - Well, I hope you don’t mind. Good.

But women are worse fools for putting up with them. And worst of all is a clever woman putting up with a stupid man. - So you think i’m a fool for putting up with my agent? - Yes. That’s why i’m sorry. But it’s your own affair. - It is indeed. But what has Mr. Sweeney done to displease you? - Oh, nothing. You might say i’ve acquired his goodwill. - Goodwill? You mean you paid him? - Two pound. - Two-- but that’s a third of the rent. - That’s the rule here: A little bit for you, a piece for him. Sweeney calls it the soft hand under the hen. - We’ll see about that. - This is all nonsense, ma’am. Who poured these stories into your ear? - No one pours anything into my ears, Mr. Sweeney. Now go. - The only hard word I say against you, ma’am, is that you’re inclined to act hasty, so I won’t say good-bye, because you’re acting hasty now.

When did you hear that? - Well, sweeney is not a happy little dog, and when he’s not happy, he runs about barking and tearing at things with his teeth. - So you thought you’d be the hound at the gate. - Well, i’m not half so greedy as sweeney. So...good for me. Good for you. - Mr. Lynchehaun, I don’t like people telling me what’s good for me. I get enough of that in church. And no.

Isn’t that so, my dear? Your chest is ticklish, isn’t it, little wifey? I do believe she’ll have to be put to bed early. We shall dine presently. Right this way, my dear. On your way. [Bell tolling] [Carriages clattering] - Fresh fish. [Indistinct chatter] - Reverend! - You remember this. [Laughs] [Clearing throat] - Uh, there seems to be a piece missing, the peace that passeth understanding. [Suppressed giggling] Well, now, Mrs. Crawley. Crawley, I like that name. You see, first I think of the name, and then I imagine the man or the woman for the name. And then, hoopla! There he is. - Shh! - But who? Who is it? I don’t know. That’s what I like. I’m watching him, and I don’t know who it is. Hoopla! - James. Keep your voice down. - I can’t, Mrs. Maccrawley; Brandy makes me loud, heh-heh, and maudlin. - Last drink, sir. Yes, sir? - I think you can leave that there. No go out, and sin no more. - Yes, sir. - Most interesting animal, it’s a half-man, half-horse, but it’s the horse half that is the most interesting. You know, because, well, men are bores. Men are most frightful bores, but god is good. Oh, aye, god is good. - God is good. - Eee! - Mind your step there, sir. - Oh, good old god. There’s a moose loose about this hoose. - Uh, excuse me, sir. - Hello? - That is the wrong room, sir. Here we are, down here. That’s it. - Thank you, sir. - Not at all. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night to you, thou good and faithful servant. Did you ever see, ever in all your days, such a cowardly little mouse of a man in all your life? "God is good." Christ. [Scoffs] - Is that how you treat people? - There’s a moose loose about this hoose. You be careful, or it’ll... R-r-r-run up your little skirteen! [Mutters indistinctly] Have a drink. - No. - Have a drink. - No. - Have a nightcap. [Sighs] Have a little nightcap in your little skirt, your big skirt. - I don’t want to drink any more. - Then you come here to me, tabby. Do you want to fight me, tabby? - No. - Yes, you do. - No. - Tabby likes to be mauled by the Tom. Doesn’t she? - No. - You’re not a little mouse. You’re a tabby. And tabby prefers Tom any day to a silly Billy. - What are you talking about? - Poor William, with his little bald spot. - William’s my friend. - Oh, he’s mine too. Sure, we can both play with him. Agnesheen, but he hasn’t got a claw to his name, and tabby likes to be clawed, doesn’t she? - No. - Yes, she does. - No! - Yes, she does. [Panting] - No. Don’t. Ah. Ah. [Whimpering] [Grunting] [Tearfully] Don’t hurt me. - You say please. - [Whispers] Please. - It’s best when you beg for it, Mrs. Meow. [Yelping] - A man was hanged here once. I said, a man was hanged here once. A priest he was, name of father manus sweeney. The English, your people, hanged him in market square, hung him from the market crane. A soldier in the crowd, a man called lytle, he shouted out, "the priest’s meat is high today." - Please. - And that’s not the end of it. It was the end of lytle, though. A few weeks later, they found his body on the mountain, 1,800 feet up, or rather, the dogs found him, dragged pieces of him down into the town. So his meat ended up higher than the priest’s, considerably less highly thought of, though. What’s wrong? - I don’t feel well. - Ah, well, the air is thin up here in the mountains, acushla. Don’t worry. The ride back to achill will clear your head. - Yes. Yes, I want to go back now. - It’s her. - Agnes, what are you doing? Where have you been? We’ve been most dreadfully worried about you. - We thought you were kidnapped. - The doctor was just now saying I would have to contact Dublin. - I don’t know what all the fuss is about. I was just staying with friends--unexpectedly. I couldn’t send a message. - But we searched every house on the island, ma’am. - I wasn’t on the island; I was on the mainland, in Newport. - Newport, ma’am? We don’t know anyone in Newport. - Ah, yes, i-- I know those people. - Anyway, as you see, i’m perfectly safe, so thank you. - Safer than some, ma’am. Safer than Mr. Sweeney. - What do you mean? - Mr. Sweeney had a class of an accident, ma’am. - Is he dead? - No, no. - Oh, thank god. Oh, god. Oh, dear, i’m very upset. I’m sorry to have caused you trouble. Will you excuse me, constable? - No trouble, ma’am. - Agnes, do you want to talk about it? - It, it. It or him? - Agnes? - Thank you for the lie about Newport. You were so quick, I almost laughed. - We all need a little laugh every now and then, don’t we? - Oh, don’t be kind to me, William. I couldn’t bear your kindness now. You know, I thought about you last night, back there in your house. I thought, "now, there’s someone who’s gentle, "someone who never goes out, someone who knows nothing about all this." That isn’t sad, is it? No, don’t touch me. No, you shouldn’t touch me. You don’t know where i’ve been. I’ve been somewhere where people aren’t supposed to go. But it’s all right. I’ll wash myself, and i’ll dress myself, and everything will be all right, right as rain. Isn’t that good? [Lock clunks] [Melancholy flute music] ♪ ♪ [Whistling] ♪ ♪ [Knocking at door] - Ah, James-- Mr. Lynchehaun, um-- - you wanted to see me. - Yeah, come in. Come in. That was a most unfortunate business with Mr. Sweeney. - Uh, yes. I only heard about it today. - Yes, because-- yes, you were... Um, in Newport. - How’d you know that? - Agnes--Ms. Macdonnell said that she saw you there. - She did see me. And I saw her. - You’ve been shooting dogs. - Yes, what of it? - Well, who gave you permission to do that? - I’m the agent. Wild dogs are my responsibility. - Well, Mrs. Macdonnell didn’t give the authority. And also this was delivered this morning. It’s a letter from the collector general of taxes. - It came today, did it, now? - Did you write to him concerning the stamping of leases? - I did. - Well, are you aware that Mrs. Macdonnell is to be fined? - Agnes knows this-- - Agnes? - You know, you used to call me James. So she wants to get rid of me, does she? - Yes, she thinks that might be best, although she has no wish to proceed with an eviction. - Very wise. - She’s authorized me to give you £15 as a token of her appreciation of your services, without prejudice, of course. - That’s very generous. You’ll forgive me if I was rude to you just now. I’m sorry. - Yes. So am I, James. - Will you let me shake your hand? You know, everyone will laugh at me now, but you won’t laugh, will you? Ask the yellow woman what I mean. I think i’ve been used. Like a stick. This money is like a stick aimed at the heart of me. [Wind howling] [Door slams] - It’s all done, ma’am, except for your overnight bag. - Thank you, biddy. Dr. Croly’s coming in the morning to take me to the station. Better have breakfast ready for him. - I will, ma’am. - I’m going to have an early night. - I’ll bring you up a glass of hot milk, or maybe a nice egg flip with a drop of Sherry in it. - What would I do without you, biddy? - I’m glad, ma’am. - So am I. [Wood creaking] [Door creaking] - Don’t cry out. I won’t hurt you. I just--just wanted to talk to you. - Oh, god. - You d-don’t have to be afraid of me. - I’m not afraid of you. - Why did you get croly to do your talking then? If you had something to say to me, you should have said it yourself. - But I couldn’t. You know I couldn’t. - So you took the coward’s way. - I want you to go now. [Gasps] - Why? What’s the reason? - Please. - What’s the reason? Is it because you think I have something to do with sweeney’s accident? I swear to you on me father’s grave, I had no hand, act, or part in that. - I know you didn’t. - Why then? Is it that you’re afraid of me because i’m a free man? - No, James. - I’m a free man. And I made love to you. You can’t walk away from that without a word. Tell me the reason why. - No. - Agnes. Agnes. You’re not like the rest of the women. Don’t pretend you are. You want a real man. I know that, and so do you. - You call this being a real man? - A real man fights for what he wants. - N-No. - Shh. Shh. Oh, ooh. Ooh, oh. What are you trembling for? Shh. - I want you to go. - [Whispers] Why? Why? Tell me why. Why? Ah! - [Screaming] Biddy! Biddy! Biddy! [Lynchehaun roaring] [Laughs] Biddy, help me! [Dog barking] [Hyperventilating] - Biddy, i-i’m bleeding. Look at me. I’m bleeding. Jeez! [Horse snorting] Agnes. Agnes. Agnes. Agnes. - [Gasps] [Whimpering] - Agnes, calm down. Talk to me. - Get away from me. Get away from me. - Agnes! [Screaming] [Horses grunting] [Bone crunches] [Horses neighing, snorting] [Agnes screaming] - No! Ah! Ah! Eee! Biddy! Wah! Biddy! [Men shouting indistinctly] [Pump squeaking] [Dramatic orchestral music] - Where is she? Ma’am! Ma’am! Take me to her! [Sobbing] - Agnes? - James. - With your permission, my lord, I read from my notes. This is from the--my first examination on that day. "Three wounds to the head. "The first is almost on the crown of the head, "reaching over to the left parietal bone. "About 3 inches long, it is lacerated and contused. "The temporal bone is fractured, "a starred fracture... "The fracture caused by a blunt instrument. "It may have been inflicted by the kick of a boot "or a stone or a heavy stick. [Chains jingle] "The entire cartilage of the nose is gone, "the nasal bone exposed. The left eye: Completely crushed." I had to remove the eye, my lord. "The larynx is inflamed and congested, "and there are distinct marks of three fingers and a thumb, "evidence considerable pressure has been applied "to the affected area. "Also-- "I also found tearing "in the soft tissues of the vagina. The right side is lacerated and torn." The third day, my lord, I found pieces of whin bushes, thorns from whin bushes embedded deeper in the tissues of the vagina, and I removed them. [Gavel banging] [Man speaking with American accent] - The supreme court of the United States accepts that Mr. Lynchehaun was lawfully sentenced to life imprisonment in Ireland. He escaped and unlawfully entered the United States. The court accepts that Mr. Lynchehaun was a member of the revolutionary organization the Irish republican brotherhood and that he led some 200 persons in attacking Mrs. Macdonnell’s property. By any standard, this was a political act. The motion to have him extradited back to British jurisdiction is therefore refused. - Anything to declare, father? - No. - Have you been long in america? - Seven years. - Long time to be away from the green hills of Ireland, hm? - Time passes. - What’s that? - Here or there, time passes. [Train whistle blows] [Dog barking] [Muttering indistinctly] - ...and a great lady, and the white house of america and they dancing. [Muttering indistinctly] Born and unborn. - Don’t believe it. - I believe you, and I don’t believe you. Do you know what I mean, boy? - Hmm? - I do. - Still, by the look of you now, i’d say you committed a great sin all the same. Am I right now? - Westport. Next stop, westport. - Westport... [Mutters indistinctly] Here, i’ll die in the night if I don’t kiss you just the once. [Baby crying] - Last stop now, achill island. Achill island, last stop. - William croly... [Muttering to himself] The president of the united states was impressed. [Jackdaw calling] - The wine. - I’ll get it. - ♪ My true love ♪ ♪ far, far away ♪ - Hurry up, biddy. I’m starving. [Fork clicking] [Tapping] [Gasps violently] [Roars] - What is it? Go in the back. Go in the back! - Agnes, I don’t mean any harm. - I’m not afraid of you, James lynchehaun. - I just wanted to talk to you, Agnes. - Go back to hell! - I can’t go back. I’m in it. - Get away from me. - Look at me. Look at me! I’m a hero. [Laughs] Isn’t that comical? I’m a hero. - [Snarling] Come on. Come on. [Gun fires] - Acushla! Acushla, nearly never did a thing. You’d hardly hit me at this distance, would ya? And what if you missed? [Gunshot] [Birdlike screaming] I’m still alive. I can’t die. I can’t die. - So who’s the hero now? - Ah!
