It was monsoon season. I made a confession in church. I lied to my uncle and auntie, pretending I was a Bears fan my whole life, but I actually... love the Twins. The priest said that changing your baseball team is an unforgivable sin. But I can't help it. The true champions of Jamsil stadium are the victorious Twins, not the stupid Bears. Jae-ha! The true champions of Jamsil stadium are the victorious Twins, not the stupid Bears I am sorry, auntie, but I can't help it! Get off me! Change your voice as you wish! Welcome to Voice-Changer. Let's make your voice 20 years older. Oh-Oh-Oh- We are glorious Twins This phone line is secure. Thank you for calling. A former baseball player will make you the MVP of social baseball. I am Jung Kwang-sung from Jung's Baseball Institute. How may I help you? Hello? Heyjackass! This is the last time you send those wimps after me. If you come again, I will kill you. You Hwagok punks! Hey! Is it sold? Hello? Hello? I don't know who you are, but I really need it. Hello? Can you still make the deal? Please let me buy it! If you have time, I can go to Jamsil right now. If you have a buyer, I will double the money. No, double-double! I don't usually make unreasonable requests. So you are... But just this once, give me a chance! Please! Yes? The money is ready! See you at Jamsil right now. Are you... ready? Yes... Yes, sir. Foxtrot! Foxtrot! Foxtrot! Fox... trot? Tango? Hey! How old are you? Thirteen. What was wrong with your voice? Puberty? What? Well... I think so. - 400 dollars. - What? But, you posted 100 dollars. You said, "double and double." When did I? On the phone? Did you record the phone call? Double! Jeez... double-double! I said 400. What? If it is double and double, it should be 100 times 3. It should be 300. 100 times two is 200 and make double out it! It is 400. You are pretty bad at math. I am just a kid, can't we make it 300? Kid... I don't usually deal with minors. I am a minor, but I am not a kid. I will give you the rest when I get home. I have been saving for my whole life to buy this. You don't believe me? Then I will... Hey! What are you doing? Where did you learn that? Don't do that! Buy some snacks, man. I don't like snacks... In 2002, there were 50 starting players, coaches and team staff in total. To forever honor the LG Twins, LG Fashion tailor-made 50 jackets for those members! So this jacket is extra-limited! But, how do you have one? Were you on the team staff back then? I would like to have that one! I will give you the rest when I get home. Do you really have money? Yes! Totally! By the way, sir... If you have time today, could you watch it with me? Hey, do not like baseball too much. Why? Is baseball life? It is life! What? What is more important in life than baseball? You are a strange man to be wearing that jacket... - What is your name? - Seo Jae-ha. - Have a girlfriend? - No. - Have someone you like, right? - No, I don't. - What is her name? - Kim Ga-young. So, doesn't Ga-young like you? Ga-young only likes books. Anyways, Jae-ha. Check this out. Imagine there was a baseball player, named Jae-ha. Jae-ha and Ga-yong were engaged. But... only terrible things started to happen in his life. Gangsters came and forced him to play baseball how they wanted, saying or else they would kill his girlfriend and his whole family. - Were you a baseball player? - This isn't about me. This is about Jae-ha who loved Ga-young. And what else? Jae-ha got banned from baseball because of those thugs, but then what else can he do? So he decided to run a used car business. But he got scammed by his business partner and lost all his money. Did you get ripped off while selling used cars? No, it is not me! It is Jae-ha, who loves Ga-young... OK. Anyway... All of his friends left him and Jae-ha lost his will to live. At that time... The only thing that comforted Jae-ha was? What is that? Baseball. Nothing other than baseball. - So... - So? - Jae-ha quit baseball. - Huh? What is left... When did the Twins beat the Bears? After winning the Korean Series? There is only one moment of happiness and it is over. It has nothing to do with real life. Isn't it good to be happy? Jae-ha. Just memorize this. Baseball is not life. Life is led by you. You blamed baseball when you messed up your life, right? Dude, seriously? I even stopped talking to my auntie for baseball! What? What happened with your auntie? Baseball is my whole life! Kid. You love baseball, you suffer. Want me to prove it? Sure! Be my guest. Watch this. See? Am I right? What the hell was that when the bases were loaded. Where are you going? Jae-ha! Man! you are upset. I am so sorry! Hey, I was upset too! I am also a fan of Twins! Don't lie to me! Seriously... - What is this? - You have it! Really? Can I really have this? Is this mine? Put your hands in the pocket. Huh? Look what is in the pocket! (Twins Baseball Cards, 2002) Why do you have this? See? I told you. Wow, Manny Martinez. Long time no see. Samson Lee! He is a legend. Hey, not those players! Look at the last card. Jung Kwang-sung, 'The Wild Horse', Bats and throws right, very aggressive. Who was your favorite teammate? Manny Martinez? - How come? - I was bullied and only played with the foreign players. Who are the champions of Jamsil stadium? - Hustle Bears! - You are funny. Who is the girl you like now? - There isn't one. - What is her name? That does not work for me. Which type of pitch did you hit well? - No matter which. - No, just pick one. Fastballs? Curveballs? Change-ups? Sliders. So, have you ever hit a home run with a slider here? Of course! No doubt! But you were ejected even before your first match. I played exhibition games! And you know what? I was not ejected, but released! Are you kidding me? You hit this far? For sure? I am telling you! Bang! See ya! It is out of the park! What is this? It looks so weird. What is wrong? It is just an accessory. Hey! This time, I will prove it. Prove what? If you really want something, your wishes may come true. So, you should keep hoping, The Wild Horse! September 20, cloudy with some showers. I saw baseball with a strange catcher. He told me not to like baseball too much, but I can't help it. For me and for him, baseball is still our life. You two look a lot alike. - Is he your son? - Oh, no, he is just a... People say you two look alike, right? No? Never? Seo Jae-ha! Jae-ha, Jae-ha, let's go home. - Hurry! Hurry! - Hey you, Jae-ha! What if something happened to you? You went to the ballpark alone! Even your phone was turned off! I was not alone. I watched it with this catcher. Excuse me. - Who are you? - Oh, well, I am... - I am the jacket. - Sorry? That jacket Jae-ha is wearing... I sold it. Oh, yeah... Sir. Are you a baseball player? Yes, oh no... He is Jung Kwang-sung, 'The Wild Horse', picked by Twins in the first round of 2002 Rookie Draft. Uncle! Can we eat together at our house, please? Because I have to pay him. Jae-ha, youâ€¦ You should say thank you and goodbye. You can't take up his time! Thank you and goodbye... Kwang-sung. Who are they? Well... They were my teammates. Uncle, do something! Hey, Mr. Catcher! Let's have dinner together in our place. Jae-ha really wants to have a meal with you. Next time. Let's eat together next time. Hang on! The Twins will protect you. It was a good deal. (The Twins jacket, 2002 limited edition) (Pre-owned by a baseball player. Give me a call.) (Transaction Completed) Oh-Oh-Oh- We are glorious Twins- This phone line is secure. Thank you for calling. A former baseball player will make you the MVP of social baseball. I am Jung Kwang-sung from Jung's Baseball Institute. How may I help you? Kwang-sung... Are you sure you are okay? Yes, of course, sir. I want to go to the ballpark often, but my auntie works late so she can't come with me. If you don't mind... It is okay if you are busy, but none of my friends like baseball. Could you go to the ball game with me... someday when you have time? Yes, of course. That sounds great. (30 days left to my second SAT study like a heck) There comes the full-count pitch! Hit! To the deep left center! This is way back! That ball is gone! The Twins are going to the Korean series for the first time since 2002! The New Wild Horse exploded a walk-off home run with a slider! Warriors and soldiers, this is your commander speaking. Jung Min-hyuk come to the head office right now. Min-hyuk, an applicant of Seoul National University. Report immediately to the head office. (You sleep, you dream. You study, your dreams come true.)

Min-hyuk, you have a mock test tomorrow. It is the last one before the SAT. You get back before sunrise. (Approved) (Jung Min-hyuk) (Your efforts never betray you.) Min-hyuk! Where are you going, Mr. Serious? It is 30 days before the test. Why are you escaping today? - Are you going to drink 30 shots? - Take me too! (The best private school for retakers.)

My cell phone got disconnected, and I just got Wi-Fi now... Oh! I think I found you! What? Where? We were supposed to meet at the end of the bus stop. That is right. But, there is no one here. Are you at another stop? Not just the end of the stop, at the very end. Come further. We have to meet where nobody will come. - Hello, there. - Yes, hello. Huh? You go to Sookmyung? How do you know? Do you go to Sookmyung Girls' High? No, I am... Chungdong Boys' High! I thought you were older than me. Oh, I am not a student anymore. I graduated... So you are older than me. - Excuse me. - Yeah? Are you ready? Right! Sure... Let's sit here. (The Bible of Mathematics) Wow... This is the Switch. I will show you first. You know how to use it. It is super simple. This is the control.

Then you will wake up 5 seconds later. Wake-up time set Lastly, press this button and it starts. - Like this? - Sweet dreams One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Open your eyes Good morning. It really works! It is 200 dollars but I will make it 190 dollars deducting your travel expenses. What? You should test it on me before I pay you. You didn't read the manual. It does not sync to anyone's body. It takes some time at first. How long? It took 5 hours for me. What? 5 hours? Date, Okay... Sleep time, Wake-up time... Set. Oh, it works! What is working? You didn't even sync it! Seriously?

I really need it for the exam. Okay then, just take it and pay me later. So, what are you going to do? (30 days before the exam) (drink 30 shots tonight) - Isn't it a school uniform? - What? Oh... Call me when you are ready. - Excuse me? - Yes? Is '30-shots' possible? We have to drink it today. All right. Question! Why did you want a Switch? Because my exam is coming up but I can't sleep. That is sad. I am asleep as soon as my head touches the pillow. But why did you use the Switch? I am bad at waking up. It also has a wake-up function. Oh, Right. Can I ask for another one? What does it feel like when you can't sleep? It is hell. Focusing on falling asleep, you only get stressed and can't sleep. So I quietly close my eyes and think of good things. - Like what? - Well... Blackpink? Then at some point, I give up, open my eyes, and look at the ceiling. Then all of a sudden, I fall asleep before I know it. And 5 minutes later, I hear the morning bugle. This is my routine. Sync in progress The estimated time is 3 hours and 20 minutes. We just wait a little longer. Where do you want to go? - For what? - University. Have not thought about it. Bad at studying. How bad are you? K, M, E, H, S, S? Korean, Math, English, Korean History, World History and Geography. Beautiful! You are really bad at math. - And you? - Me? Korean, Math, English, History - Physics and Earth Science - What are you... Are you not going to college? I have to go. You never thought about it. If I enter a better university than my dad, I can do whatever I want. What college did your father graduate from? Korea University (the 2nd best in Korea) And me... Seoul National University (the best in Korea) Can you do it? OK then, What do you want to do other than that? I am... not sure about that yet. And you? What is your dream? I want to be... an office worker! - What office worker? - Just an office worker. I walk around with a company pass around my neck and make hundreds of copies. I hope the copier is Xerox. You are so good at school, and do you want to do copying? Isn't it such a beautiful sound when the shining beams pass over the paper? - Do you have a copier at home? - Of course not. See! Only office workers can have copiers. (Incoming call: Mama) I am going to the bathroom. 30-shots, Switch test, then nothing. Why did I meet her 30 days before the exam? You two like each other, right? No... If it was different timing, could we be together? - A little? - Oh! She likes him! There is no "if" in life. If there is an "if", why are you repeating this exam? I don't even know his name yet. Go for it! Do you want to fail the exam again? Hug him! Hug him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Hold yourself, Jung Min-hyuk! The 30 shots are ready. Never drink too much. Good luck with your exam. This is my second time. This will be the last time. When I was in school, there was a movie theater. When I was cleaning, I found a VHS, not even a DVD. You know Cameron Diaz? No idea about old actors. Anyway, Cameron Diaz plays a rich girl in the movie. A real loser holds her for ransom from her father. But, she falls in love with him. That is the story. There is a scene like this. Let's just say I hold you a hostage. Am I Cameron Diaz? Why not? After a big argument, we were here to drink tequila. I want to be kidnapped from school. It is supposed to be tequila, but we are Korean... - But there is one problem. - What? My first time drinking alcohol. You said you did this last year! I could not. I had no courage... A 2nd chance has come. Are you giving me courage? Because I am Cameron Diaz. - Five. - Four. - Three. - Two. - ONE! - ONE! Was it good? Freaking delicious! It is bittersweet. It is salty! Crazy night in Gangnam! Let me introduce a special guest who will make the night even crazier! Cameron Diaz of Gangnam. A 3rd grader at Sookmyung Girls' High, Min Ye-ji!

Today, like yesterday My day was long Somehow, I don't want to go home tonight just hanging around and getting on the bus The lights outside the window when they shine on me The backpack next to me asks me How was your day? Even after a long time and even if I read and memorize many books my life running through the bluegrass, my life seemed like a strong promise is getting harder and harder My bag opened its mouth and said I used to have a hard time too It is okay, though. Stay strong there a little bit more Yesterday was a day Today was a day I wait for tomorrow I am waiting I am waiting for November today as well It is so pretty! The best night view ever.

What makes you want this life when you have a steady job? My friend is dying. - Your friend is dying? - He is going to die and... I have to kill him. What the hell are you... We have just met and became quite close friends. Looking at the guy whom I am supposed to kill by myself, I thought... life is... Life is damn short. I had this thought. And I felt the same for myself and so you, and you, and Kyo-hyung, sleeping over there. We all could die tonight. Why would we die? The building could collapse. Sirs, look. Are you laughing now? Our lives seem to be a given, on the surface. But one day, suddenly, Sampoong department store collapsed and Seongsu bridge collapsed. We didn't do anything wrong, but it just happens.

It is really high quality. Now, today's English word. Often on the SAT. Perjury. Read it out loud. Perjury. - With confidence. - Perjury. Perjury. "You lie, you go to prison." That is what it means. Go to prison? (I lied to my uncle and auntie...) I know you betrayed your family. Yes. But your uncle and aunt forgave you, right? Yes. Why did they? It is about honesty. You betrayed your family, but didn't lie. Jung Kwang-sung, 'The Wild Horse' Shall we read it again? - Perjury. - With confidence! Perjury. You are an honest kid, aren't you? Yes. If you tell me what you know, your uncle and aunt won't know anything and you won't get in trouble. Actually, instead of getting told off, you will get a really big present. Because you are an honest kid. You know Mr. Catcher, don't you? Yes. Do you know where he is too, right? Can I meet him too? - Mr. Catcher? - You have to meet another man first. Another man? Mr. Skull. After the death sentence, Mr. Skull said his final wish was for an item. The corrections will allow special interviews to who can bring the item. (Army life ain't over till it is over.) If you find the item, you can meet Mr. Skull. You know where it is, don't you? Yes. It might be close to you. (Chapter 4 Knightmare) (Seoul Central Prison) Ms. Jeong Na-na? He is the most vicious one I have ever met. Do you know how people like him act? (Security Seal/ Jeong Na-na) He will insist that he is innocent. Don't be fooled by him. You know there are cases where hostages feel pity for their kidnappers? It is called Cameron Diaz syndrome. We are going to protect you but please keep this. Never get close to him and keep a safe distance. Okay? (Special Interviews Room) I know it is not against the rules if we do it all together, but this student doesn't know them and they didn't make a reservation. Yes, sir. I will keep working. Ms. Jeong? I am sorry, but... today is the last visit. My boss allowed them to stay here with you. That is no problem. We will start now. 30 minutes left! Are you ready? That is perfect. I thought the seller would be the same age as me. The money is fine, sir. - Is it not enough? - I mean there is no need, mister. But if you don't mind, can I have an interview? Sorry? This is really... Are you... - a reporter? - I am not a reporter, sir. Just... my personal coverage? Come to think of it, something seems suspicious about this. Even if it is my last wish, Mr. Min could deliver the money for me. Further, it is not easy for an ordinary person to come here. I am not an ordinary person, sir. May I ask you for an interview? First, can I play the game? I don't have much time left. 25 minutes left! (Stage 1) I really, have to see the ending. I always made it to the last stage, but I never saw the ending. Why was I always executed by the final boss? Now I have a plan. Let's see. Sir, how about doing an interview while playing the game? Let's do that. Hey! Unauthorized interviews in this room are prohibited. Didn't I get permission? (Stage 2) (Stage 4) Let's begin. Hello, I am Jeong Na-na, a Mass Communications student. Please introduce yourself. Hi. I am... By the way, who is going to see this interview? The catcher... No. Just think I am the only one to see. You can relax. Hello, everyone. I am sorry to say hello to you in the profile. I am sure you know me from the media reports. I am Jin Woo-chul of Hwagok-dong. First question. What happened to you? What should I say... If you don't mind, may I ask you a question? Of course. Would you believe me, if I told you I was innocent? You are knownâ€¦ to have killed a whole family. Is it your own thought? - Pardon? - "Jin Woo-chul killed people." Is that your opinion? That is not my opinion. I have seen it on the news. Then... that must be right. As a mass communications student, you know that must be right. Why don't you give it to me straight? How did you feel when the execution was decided? What else is there to confess? It has already been decided. It was in the paper, too. Sir, I will trust you. I believe there is another truth outside the angle of the camera coverage. That is why I wanted to meet you today. I have already received a ruling from a respected judge. And I feel responsible for my involvement. That is the truth. - Sir! - Then, you go first. You have done a lot of research, what kind of person do you think I am? 15 minutes left! (Stage 5) The whole story... started in 2002. Mr. Jin Woo-chul was the street boss of the Hwagok-dong family. Am I right? All correct. In the spring of that year, you met "Mr. J", the rookie catcher of the Twins. J was not talented so he got ejected even before his first game. It is unfair to say a professional player was not talented. And he was not ejected but released. Anyway, J was not that good at baseball, but he had a silver tongue. J was well-connected with umpires, and you gathered investors. The quality of your research is excellent. As far as I know, the news ever gave his initial, "J". As I said, I am not an ordinary person. You were caught in an attempted match-fixing case. The umpire J recruited, took the money and refereed fairly in the game. The people who lost money came to Hwagok-dong. Your boss compromised with them by reimbursing half the damage, and he gave you a chance to make up for your failure. Revenge. You followed the umpire's family on a day they went hiking. And it happened even before he set up the tent with his son and daughter. That is what has been reported. But what I researched was a little bit different. For revenge, he didn't appoint you, but J, "The Wild Horse". (The Last Stage) Didn't you know? We just do as we are told. So it does not matter? Girl, the law is not that simple! His life is not that simple either! Quiet! Quiet! Let me concentrate! Here comes... ("The Final Boss") the last one! What the... It is not supposed to go back to the beginning. It is not supposed to go back... I don't understand why... Don't you think this doesn't make sense? 5 minutes to go. It can't just go back like this! This can't be true! This is a freakingâ€¦ I can't start this from the beginning again! Hold on, sir! Officer! Give me my phone! Hurry! The use of communication devices in this room is prohibited. Just one phone call! One more round! If I can play one more round, I should be able to do better. ("Jeong Na-na") - Jeong Na-na? - Jeong Won-shik! - What is all this? - No time to explain. "Knightmare", how to see the ending? Did you take Knightmare? Oh, come on! I will do whatever you want. Just tell me how to see the end? What the hell are you saying? Bring it up here right away! I will run errands for a month. I will call you sir, please? Bring it. - End of discussion. - I will cut off your allowance! - Hello? - Hello? - Who is this? - I am a prison guard. It is urgent. Please can you tell me how? - Why should I? - A blind date. - Pardon? - How about a blind date? - What the hell are you... - I have a sister. It is weird to say this, but she is nice. She eats very well. Your brother is a good boy too, right? - I guess so. - You have not even asked her. No, no, she wants it! Na-na, turn on your Airdrop. Sent? So? - Did you hang up? - 1 minute left! At the beginning screen, select and launch Knightmare again. - Done? - All right. Move the 'Auto' switch to the right when the title comes up. Raise 'Speed' to the max. Up and down the joystick. (Life Recovery Mode) Lastly, press the attack button twice. Then you can get your last life back. Now the rest is up to you to see the ending. Nice job, bro! Officer, ask Na-na my number... 30 seconds to go! 20 seconds to go! Did he kill it? Really? He did it! He made it! (You bravely beat all the enemies.) (May the rest of your life be full of joy...) Goodbye, Mr. Final boss! Goodbye, you... Thank you. Thank you so much. (Buy this classic game (for my friend who will go a long way.) (Transaction Completed) You must be a soldier. Pardon? How much is a soldier's monthly salary? Sorry but... It is about... $3000? Wow, that is awesome. (It was a good deal. Mr. Skull) (Sookmyung Girls' High, Min Ye-ji) Hey, Min-hyuk. Are you going to do it or not? 3rd time SAT? - You know I will do. - No. Phone call. How can I call her in my situation? Bro! Be a man! Hey! Isn't it the notification day for the extra places at the university?" No news by now means a failure. But you are the first on the waitlist... - Bro! - Prisoner 157, Jung Min-hyuk. - But I envy you a little. - What for? Dormitory meals are so delicious! You can taste it again! - Bro. - Prisoner 157, Jung Min-hyuk. I would be a 3rd-time retaker. Way to go Min-hyuk! I know my life is over now. Stop being pathetic. Hey, look. Over there. Second chance will come anyway. (Jin says on a reprieve, ) ("It is like a Christmas gift.") ("It ain't over till it is over.") (Mr. J finally showed up, quoting Yogi Berra.) That guy... Yogi Berra played for the Boston Red Sox, right? New York Yankees. "It ain't over till it is over." He messes up his exam, but only has a good pronunciation. Boys. - What? - Why? I am going to do it. What? Exam again? The call. Really? (Congratulations...) - Huh? I am in the? - Oh! Wait, wait! (Congratulations (on your acceptance to Seoul National University) I am going to the top university! Take this off! This is yours. "It ain't over till it is over." (The Last Chapter: The Gift of the Magi) (Comic Book Store) (Even when life tricks you) I am sorry to be late. Please sit. (Even when life tricks you) (- CEO Kim Ba-da ) Are you ready? In the late 1970s, President Park was ambitious to train world-class writers. So he mobilized the best translators to craft the first collection of world literature since liberation. But... Can you sell it? No way! You scumbag! Your sister is working so hard to feed you and Jae-ha. You should just be writing! - But you are selling books? - Hey, ma'am! Miss... Ms. Karenina? Ms. Anna Karenina! Please make me a cup of Caramel Macchiato. Can you read it? Can you read? Oh, my... Class of 1988, Russian Literature. Wow, Pushkin... I majored in Russian literature, too. Well... I am sorry if I messed up your day. But please do not let this deal happen. But my daughter has been waiting so long for today! Ji-sook, I really need the money. - What money do you need? - Listen to me. - This deal is invalid! - Come on! A Christmas gift... You remember... When did I ask you to buy me that by selling your books? Sorry, ma'am. I understand the situation, but we made an appointment and have invested our time. I feel it is improper to drop it unilaterally like this. Also, it is not exemplary conduct to my daughter. Why don't youâ€¦ take the books out and think about it? I know how sad it is to sell books because of money. So... If you really can't part with certain books, put those over here. Even if there is one or two books you can sell, I will buy them. Furthermore, I will pay the same as I promised. What? All the money? What do you say? (For Whom the Bell Tolls) (by Ernest Hemingway) (Why did Hemingway shoot himself?) (I will write to figure it out.) (1999, Song Seok-ho) (To my brother, who will win the Nobel Prize!) How dare you sell the book I signed for you! (Song Seok-ho, Songpa middle) (5th failure for the literary award) (Cut and make myself smaller) (to enter the strait gate.) (Pale Fire) (by Vladimir Nabokov) (Desperate writing July 2011) (Happy writing September 1999) (Run! Novels are dangerous!) (Sometimes I drop tears.) (I am the king of literature!) (Celebrating the 11th failure) (Failed again. Write again.) (I can't change the world, ) (but I can change myself.) (Write little by little each day, ) (without hope or despair.) (Honesty, Sincerity, Diligence) (The Brothers Karamazov) (18th attempt and failure 18th!) (You sleep you dream. You write, your dreams come true.) (But you can do it. 33-year-old Song Seok-ho) (Help me, Ji-sook!) (22, Life is beautiful.) (29, Life is still beautiful.) (34, Life will be beautiful.) (It ain't over till it is over.) Stop it! That is so cruel! Never mind, sir. I will sell them all. - Pardon? - What? Ji-sook. I am not selling them just for Christmas gifts. I quit writing. - Brother. - Wait. - Quit what? - Song Seok-ho, you... Song Seok-ho? Yes? Mr. Song Seok-ho, who lives in Songpa, Seoul. Or you lived in Songpa, at least a few years ago? I did live in Songpa, but how do you know that? Mister, you can't stop writing just like that! Why are you... He is right! You never quit. She is right! You keep going. What are you saying all of a sudden? Song Seok-ho from Songpa, once applied for the Rookie Award of the 'Sea of Literature'. In 2015 or 2016? I remember clearly. I apply and fail every year. It was 2015. (The official result, 'Sea of Literature') In the final hearing, the judges had a heated debate. Song's work is an interesting piece, reminiscent of Hermann Hesse's 'Demian'. But why is the end of the story bitter? Maybe it is because none of the characters show their own honest feelings? It is unfortunate that the piece has not made final-selection, as his writing could not get over "the absence of human emotion". But, but we will wait for the day when he comes out of his own shell, like a bird from an egg, for the day when his name, Song Seok-ho blazes like a comet across our literary world. Who are you? I am a story hunter, always looking for new talent. How do you know the old review of the 3rd-rate literary magazineâ€¦ Nice to meet you. I am Dr. Ocean Kim, editor of 'Sea of Literature', a 3rd-rate literary magazine. Mr. Song. I mean... Writer Song, you are gifted. Keep writing. (Top 100 literary prospects) The end! Ga-young is practicing her writing. Oh my! Do you write, too? You must be a little literary prodigy! A writer... should not sell his life. Writer Song. Take them back. If that is the case, Ga-young will understand. Instead, I would like to pay you as I promised. - Sorry? - What? You buy her an overcoat with it. Let's say it is a Christmas gift from me and Ga-young. - Instead... - Instead? Why don't you sell... our story to Ga-young? If you allow her to write about tonight. Sell our story? And real names. - Our real names? - What did you say? It is a deal. We will sell tonight's story and names to Ga-young. It was a good deal. Is something wrong? It is awkward to get money from a stranger. So, can I buy that book of poetry with this money instead? It will be the best Christmas gift for my sister. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. (Transaction Completed) (Eastern Detention Center of Seoul) (Merry Christmas) Awesome! (Alexander Pushkin) He was born in 1799. He is handsome. - You two look alike. - Really? - Do we look alike? - You two think alike, actually. Can you read it on our way? Read what? - Pushkin. - Oh, right. Listen carefully. Pushkin has written this for you. Even when your life tricks you Don't be sad, don't be wild Don't be weepy as your brutal life is the way to the glory You dream of a better future You breathe in a bitter day But once everything goes by in a flash Today will be precious Uncle!
