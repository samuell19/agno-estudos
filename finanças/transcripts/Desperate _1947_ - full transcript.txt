You're dead, steve. I'm a g-man now, and i got you covered. Aw, come on, richard, give me a break, and i promise you i'll go straight. What are the flowers for? Is somebody sick? Nope. I'm married 4 months today. 4 months? Why, that ain't a year. I don't know whether mother said 6 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt or 6 tablespoons of salt and a pinch of sugar. Both: Ewww! She must have said a pinch of salt. Oh, i hope this turns out right. You know, it's my first attempt. I'm glad we're trying it out on your husband. He'd like it if you made it out of cement. Well, i don't know about that. Wonder what time it is. Uh-oh. Steve will be home any minute now. Don't feed him too much for lunch. He'll end up with a bay window like my henry. Mm. Not a chance. Steve works too hard. I figured you might want these for the cake. One for each month. Well, they're, uh, a little large, aren't they? Well, the grocer didn't have any. I had to get these from the plumber. Oh, no! Ah, they're wonderful. And when they're all lit after dinner, turn off the lights and tell him. How did you tell henry? V-mail. Judy was 8 months old when he got home. Aw. Who is it? Steve: Gas collector. When you're married 4 months, that's still cute. Just a minute. Remember, not a word about the baby. I give you my solemn oath. Get lost, will you? I'd like a little privacy. It's a free country, ain't it? Look, richard, you got the whole building to annoy people. Go down and try the basement, huh? Wise guy. There's nobody living in the basement. You're getting the idea. Well, hello, mrs. Roberts. Hi, steve. Yes? I understand your husband's been putting lead slugs in the meter. Well, if he has, they're the best slugs money can buy. Hello, darling. Oh, steve! Oh! Oh, steve. They're beautiful. Give them to me. Not a chance. I'm saving them for a! Good " girl. But i'm good. You opened the door for a strange gas collector. That's because he sounded so handsome. Oh, you country girls. I told you never to trust anyone, honey. Not anyone, steve? Not everyone. Oh, they're beautiful. Do you like them? Mmm! Love them. You didn't think i'd remember our anniversary, did you? Steve, you're wonderful, and l- oh! But you're not to open it until tonight after dinner. Well, all right if you say so oh, there was a call for you who was it? I don't know, but here's the number you're to call as soon as you come in. Then we'd better call. Wife: -hmmm, mmm oh, and also ask for mr. Reynolds. Thank you. Yes, sir. You see i'm a success. Got the customers calling me. You got a nickel? I think so. Hello? Steve: Hello, mr. Reynolds? Yes? Steve: This is steve randall i was told you wanted me to call you oh yeah, randall, i'm glad you called. I usually use a friend of mine in the trucking business but he's out of town. I have some perishables i have to move tonight. Oh, i am awfully sorry, but anytime but tonight willing to pay $50. Just a minute. Fella wants some hauling done tonight, and he's willing to pay $50. $50? Why, that's a lot of money. Yeah, but what about our celebration? I won't be able to make it for dinner. It can wait until you get home, steve. Ok. All right, mr. Reynolds. I can make it. Yeah. Warehouse 3... west street. Sure, i'll be there at 7:00. Ok, thanks a lot. Man: I told you he'd take it. I still think we should have gotten biggy's truck. Biggy's truck's too well known. Every time it comes out of a garage, a police car tails it. But how do you know he won't talk? He needs the dough. He's just out of the army with a wife on his hands. Anyway, i know he won't blow the whistle on me. I've known him since we were kids. Maybe it would have been smarter to cut him in. He wouldn't come with us if he thought this was a heist. No. This job's going to be cut 4 ways and no more. What about me? You're staying out of it. Stop treating me like a kid, walt. I'm not in short pants anymore. Look... i'm your brother, and i want you to keep your nose clean. I'm tired of taking money from you. How about it, walt? Let me go just this once. It's an easy job. All right. Guess we couldn't pull this job without al. Hello, steve. You're right on time. Hello, walt. What are you doing around here? I'm the boss here, steve. Where will i find a mr. Reynolds? Reynolds? Yeah. He works for me. He's busy inside. Hello, steve. You remember the kid brother. Yeah, sure. There's another vault in there, and it's full of furs. Ok, get them and step on it- and put that rod away! Hey, just a minute. What is all this? Take it easy, steve. Everything will be all right. Come on. Get that stuff out of my truck. You're a bunch of crooks, and i'm not going to get mixed up in it. Why don't you get smart? I said get that stuff out of my truck. Ok, shorty. Put him in the truck and keep him there. I got to get al. He's hurt. It's too late. The place is crawling with cops. Al, get up! It's no use, walt. They'll get us, too. Come on, let's go! All right, wise guy, drive where i tell ya, or you'll get a sudden bellyache. Everybody get away? Man: I lost walt and reynolds at the warehouse. But they're ok. What happened to you? Wise guy tried to pull a fast one, but he wasn't fast enough. They got al. If that cop dies, he'll face a murder rap. I'd hate to be in your shoes if that's true. Walt is sure crazy about that kid. He got the jump on me, walt, and before i could do anything, he drove the truck away. Walt: Yeah, i saw it. But i managed to bring him back here for you, walt. You ran out on us. I never was in with you. He tipped the copper, too, by blinking his lights. I ought to kill you. You pulled the truck right out from under al. Now the cops have got him. If he burns... you know, i got an idea. I'm going to make it easy on both of us. Yeah, yeah, that's it. You go to the cops and say you did it. You talked al into it. He's just a kid. He didn't know what the job was all about. You're crazy. You can't frame me. I wasn't in on this deal. Hello, police headquarters? I just thought you'd like to know the license number of that truck in the warehouse robbery tonight. It's 1coo2d. Well, you're in it now, steve, with both feet. I can prove i'm innocent. You're going in there and tell them al had nothing to do with it. You're crazy. I'm getting out of here. Ugh! I think we can convince him to go to the police. Hold it. Change your mind? Walt: Change your mind, steve? You outsmarted yourself this time... this time, walt. If l-if i have to take a murder rap for al, you might as well... kill me here. Walt: Say, i'll bet that new bride of yours is pretty. How about it, steve? Pick her up. No, no. Wait a minute. Going to the police? Yeah. While you're there, we'll have the missis. I don't care what you tell them, but if al doesn't walk out of that police station by midnight, your wife ain't going to be so good to look at. Hello. Steve: Hello, anne? Steve. Listen carefully, honey. You've got to get out of the house. Out of the house? But why? I can't explain now. Just throw a few things in a bag and hurry. But, darling, l- i don't understand. Wh-what's it all about? Look, go down to the northwest terminal. Get on the northbound limited. I'll find you. Oh, please, please tell me, steve. What's wrong? Northwest terminal. You got it? Yes, yes, i've got it. Northwest terminal. But, darling, i... steve! Steve! Hello! Oh, steve. Oh... steve, your face. Shh! Darling. Darling, you're hurt. Oh, i've got to get some water. No, wait. What happened? Were you... were you in an accident? Yeah, an accident. Did you hurt somebody? I don't know. Where are we going? Oh, steve, i don't understand. Why are we running away? Look... look, if you're in some kind of trouble, why don't you go to the police? I can't. No questions. Let's get some rest. I'm tired. Oh, but, steve, i want- please, anne. Not tonight. All right. We'll talk about it in the morning. We were going to celebrate tonight. Happy anniversary. You dumb ox. I ought to knock your brains out. You got to believe me. I tell you he jabbed me in the belly with his elbow, and l- you must have studied to get that stupid. By now, steve's got a 4-hour start, and the cops have got my kid brother. Relax, walt. We'll get steve. Yeah. Yeah, we got to find him, make him go to the cops. Al's just a kid. Pete lassich could find him. Steve doesn't know him. Reynolds: Sure, walt. He'll find him. Pete was a pretty good private dick till he lost his license. Get him, shorty. Tell him he's working for me. Pete will want to see some money in advance. We better find him. Yeah, wherever he is, we got to find him. Here you are, folks. All the latest papers, up-to-date magazines, and periodicals. Paper. Yes, sir. Thank you. Anne: Paper, please. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All the latest morning papers, up-to-date magazines, and periodicals. Here you are, folks, all the latest papers, steve, they've got your picture in the paper. Yeah, i know. Now everybody will be looking for me. Believe me, anne. This is all a mistake. Then why don't you go to the police? I can't. Not till i get you to a safe place. Oh, darling, don't worry about me. But i've got to. Look, the longer you put it off, the harder it's going to be to convince them of your innocence. Well, that's a chance i've got to take. That man. He's recognized me. Oh, steve, you're imagining things. Don't stare at him. But, steve- come on, we've got to get off this train. Junction falls next. Let's go. What's so interesting? Honeymooners. I can spot them every time, with that happy, silly look on their faces. Hmm. They'll soon get over that. Oh, steve, what are we going to do now? I hope the conductor didn't notice us when we got off. We got to get out of here, honey. Oh, darling, i'm frightened. Take it easy and trust me. Trust me? Yeah. Ok, let's go. Thank you, mr. Smith. Steve. Steve, are you sure you weren't mixed up in that robbery? Of course i'm sure. I'm sorry, anne. But you've got to let me work this out and trust me. Oh, steve... how long do we have to keep on running away like this? Steve, please go to the police. Tell them what happened, for my sake. They'll believe you. No, they won't. All they'll believe is that a cop's been killed. They'll lock me up, and who's going to look after you? But why would they lock you up? Because i was there. Look, anne, i don't like this running away. I know it's been rough on you, but we've got to stay out of sight until i can get you in a safe place. Yes, but, where can we go, steve? How about your aunt's farm? Aunt klara and uncle jan? Yeah. Oh, steve, they'd love to have us. Then we'll go to the farm. I'll get a job and pick up a few extra dollars. We're going to need it. I'm looking for mr. Morgan. I'm morgan. I was wondering if you can use a mechanic. They look like they need some work done on them. I do my own work. Pick out any one of them, and i'll make it run for you. I'm not looking for mechanics. I'm looking for customers. How about this heap? How much you want for it? $200 cash. I'll give you $90 cash. That's all i got. The price is 200, mister. But it's not worth 90. Maybe not, but the price is still $200. The law of supply and demand. I've got it, you want it. Ok. Got anything cheaper? You can have that one for 90. Does it run? Well, you said you were a mechanic. You got some tools i can use for a few hours? Let's see your money. You'll find the tools in the shack there. How you doing? Say, i never thought it would run like that. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Yeah. It could still use a couple of new parts, though. Yeah, maybe i can get $250 for it now. Well, you better give me my bill of sale. Or maybe even 300. I'm in pretty much of a hurry. Oh, uh... let me see your license. Oh, i must have left it at home. Oh, that's too bad. What do you mean? The law says i've got to see your license and check your name. I know, but i can give you any information you need. No, that wouldn't be legal. Why, you dirty crook. I'd be careful who you call a crook, mister. I've got an idea you aren't in such a hurry for nothing. Look, morgan, we made a deal. You accepted my money. That money just about paid for the time you wasted. Now, go on and get out of here before i turn you in. Woman: Oh, ace. Your lunch. Who are you? What's wrong? I'm dr. Wilson, and there's nothing wrong, young man. You're going to be a father. Just see that she has enough rest, plenty of milk, and good food. Good day. Anne. Steve, i wanted to surprise you. Remember the party we were going to have? L-i just baked my first cake, and... i wanted to tell you that night while we were celebrating. Now we've really got something to celebrate. Steve... are you... are you glad? Of course i'm glad. But i can't go on dragging you around like a hunted animal. Good food and rest, milk. Oh, now, wait a minute. Don't take it so seriously. Well, you're going to get that good food and rest. We're going to the farm. Take it easy, mom. I'll be back in 15 minutes with a car. All right. Steve, is it bad? I don't know, honey. But don't you worry. I'm the best mechanic around here. Having trouble? Distributor's shot. Ah! That's old ace morgan's junk pile. I know that heap. Ought to give that fella morgan a talking to i could fix it in a minute if i had a new distributor. I could take you back to morgan's. No thanks. I wouldn't want you to go way back there. Well, there's a big garage a couple of miles up ahead. You can get what you need there. And i won't be going out of my way. Well thanks a lot. That would be a big help. Okay. All right if i take my wife? I don't want to leave her here. Sure, we've got plenty of room. Come on. Thanks. I'm hat lewis, county sheriff. I'm steve edwards. This is my wife anne. How do you do? Where are you kids heading? West. Uh. I'm told that the country is the best place to bring up a child. Well, in that case, we better take it easy. Man on police radio: Calling car 41. car 41. Report to macgregor ranch, route 6. Neighbors report a prowler. Macgregor ranch, route 6-prowler. That's quite a gadget. Doesn't it get on your nerves? Can't turn it off. Never know what will come through that thing. Radio: Attention all cars. Attention all cars. Be on the lookout for a 1929 ford coupe reported stolen from morgan's used car lot. Driver about 28, 6 feet tall, black hair. Attention all cars. Should think you'd have tried to steal a better car than that old jalopy. Where are you taking us? Back to morgan's. Look, i didn't steal that car. He cheated me. He took $90 from me and then refused to give me the car. I wouldn't put it past morgan. Well, we'll see. Look, my wife's not well. I wouldn't try anything if i were you, young fella. Just take it easy. Anne: Look out! Anne. Anne! Are you all right? Yes, dear. I'm all right. Oh, steve, what about him? You think he's... his head must have hit the wheel. He's all right. Just knocked out. Let's go. Oh, but, steve, we can't leave him here like this. He's all right. He'll come to in a minute. We've got to get out of here, anne. Oh, but, steve- don't argue, please. We got to get out of this car. Where are you headed for? St. Paul. What have you got in the truck? Some junk for the county fair. You see anything of a man and a woman on the highway today, young couple? I wish i had. We've been stopped 10 times today on account of them. Well, they're part of a gang that killed a policeman in a warehouse robbery. Yeah. Oh. I'll take a look in back. Ok. The driver was right- sure is a load of junk. Ok, take it away. All right. You all right? Yeah, i'm... just a little frightened. They're headed for st. Paul. That's right in the direction of the farm. Oh, steve, steve. We're really in trouble now. How are you going to explain stealing the sheriff's car? I don't intend to explain anything until you're safe. We got to take our chances and stay with this truck awhile longer. Ok, steve. Look... i love you, anne. Keep thinking that no matter what happens. I love you, too, steve. Anitza! My little anitza! You've come home! Oh, such a joy! We thought you'd like it better if we surprised you. And this is your husband- stefan! Hello, aunt klara. Just like you said in your letter- he is beautiful. He's handsome, aunt klara. To me, he's beautiful. But in all the time you have been away, only one letter. Oh, now, wait a minute. Don't you scold me because you only sent me one letter. No, 2! We sent you another last week. Oh, we'd probably already left on our trip, honey. Oh, it doesn't matter now. Papa and me, we asked you to come and stay with us for a while. And-and here you are. You see? God hears my prayers. The letter wasn't necessary. Now let's have a cup of coffee. Right. Mm! Take it easy, walt. Banging around on the walls ain't gonna do any good. Why don't we hear from lassich? Pete said it would be a couple of days. Yeah. When's he going to bring his information? After the kid burns? That might be him now. Yeah. Man: It's me-pete. Where have you been all week? It's hard to talk when a guy's holding my collar tight. Couldn't rush anything, walt. Every now and then, a bunch of cops would show up and look around asking questions. I had to wait till they all left. All right. What did you find out? Plenty, but it cost me an extra 200. Listen, you bloodsucker. I'm sick of paying and getting nothing, see? You don't scare me, walt, and i don't like doing business with guys who push me around. And when you find out what i know... maybe it will be worth the 200. All right. What did you find out? I got a little something out of randall's mailbox. Yeah. Yeah, this is## something. How did the cops miss this? The same way they missed getting you. It was stashed. That's one of the reasons it's been costing so much. It's from his wife's relatives, asking when they're going to come out and visit the old farm. Yeah. I think they were headed that way. You go up there and have a look. Well, what are you waiting for? The farm's in minnesota, walt. I got to take a train. I like riding cushions, walt, and it costs dough. You're squeezing me, pete, but i've got to take it-for now. Another 100, walt. Suppose you tell me what he looks like. Don't hurt him, pete. Whatever you do, don't hurt him. Isn't this a wonderful farm? Yeah. You know, i was born and raised in back of the stockyard. I never dreamed that flowers grew anyplace except in a window box. Oh... darling, this is the perfect place to stay until the baby comes. Anne, now that you're safe, i'm going to the police, tonight. Oh, steve, steve. I'm so glad. Oh, i know this is the right thing to do. Just go to them and get the whole thing cleared up once and for all. I'll borrow uncle jan's pickup truck and drive all night. I've got to give myself up. Nobody's going to take me in in handcuffs. Yes, but-but what about aunt klara and uncle jan? In the morning, you can explain to them that-that i had to go settle some unfinished business. All right. Ohh! Don't worry. Promise me? I promise. So you really had nothing to do with the robbery at all. No, sir. You see, mr. Ferrari, i didn't know what i was getting into. I'm the one who signaled that policeman by blinking my lights. Too bad the policeman didn't say a word about it, steve. When i saw him down at the morgue, he was pretty dead. I know it sounds fishy, but i couldn't get here any sooner. I had to get my wife someplace where she'd be safe. So you stole 2 cars doing that. Don't you understand? I couldn't help it. They were going to hurt my wife, and we're going to have a baby. Remind me to send him a father's day present. Look, mr. Ferrari, you've got to believe me. Otherwise why would i walk in here? Maybe you came in to get out of the sun or to use the telephone. You're just a nice kid. You wouldn't harm a fly. Listen, randall, what sort of a chump do you think i am? You didn't really expect me to fall for that song and dance? I expect you to believe the truth-i'm innocent. Out of every 7 guys who go to the chair, 6 of them go yelling, "i'm innocent." It was your truck, and we found it full of stolen furs. You saw a cop, so you ran away. Now your ex-partners are after you, and you come running to the police hollering for help. What you're saying isn't true, i tell you. You stole a couple of cars. You left the sheriff lying unconscious in the road. Huh. Just a nice kid. You say you're innocent. Yes. Ok. That's good enough for me. Go ahead, take a walk. Blow. You mean you're not going to hold me? I can get you anytime i'm ready. Now, get out of here. Why didn't you throw him in the cooler? Oh, he'd be too lonesome. When i hook those sharks, i want them all together. Well, how do you figure to get them all together? With the bait that just walked out. You know, anna, alex sorenson will be disappointed when he learns you're married already. And who is alex- the old boyfriend? Oh, no. Alex sorenson is our minister who brought little anitza from the old country after my widowed sister passed away. She was only 4 years old and so small and so pretty. Oh, now. Such a beautiful bride you must have been. Wasn't she, stefan? Yes, she was, aunt klara. The most beautiful bride i ever saw. Tell me about the wedding. Who was the minister? We were married by a judge. Wha... you were not married by a minister? Well... you see, aunt klara, at the time, steve had just gotten out of the army, and, well, we didn't have any money. But money? What answer is money? Our minister wouldn't ask for money. And now with the baby... it isn't legal. Of course it is, aunt klara. No, no, no. It isn't good, anna, such a wedding. Why can't we have a real wedding now? Yeah. We can make a wedding here... like we always planned when anna was a little girl. A real czech wedding like we used to have in the old country. Oh, please, anna. Please. Why not, anna, if that's what aunt klara wants? All right, dear. Good! Now let's drink to our little anitza's wedding. Ooh, such a wedding it will be. Women-always crying. There's time enough to cry at the wedding. Come on. The turkey's getting cold. ...and have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before god and this company and thereto have given and pledged their troth each to the other and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands... i pronounce that they are man and wife, in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. Amen. Congratulations, my son! You are such a sweet darling! Anitza, you were lovely. Lovely. Ha ha! Now, no tears, mama. No tears. Come on, everybody. Clear the floor now. Clear the floor. We're going to celebrate. Put those back there. Move them. Put them all back to the wall. We're going to have a good time. Play the czardas. Darling, remember the baby. &c@ play a waltz. Pete: Well, the whole village is here tonight. Our friend jan said every man in the village must attend his anitza's wedding. Wow! That's what i call hospitality. Let's have a drink, stranger. Never turned one down yet. Well, then what are we waiting for? How do you feel, darling? I feel safe for the first time. As i was saying, i went to the farm. Well, was he there? Don't rush me, walt. You're always rushing me. Someday i'll really rush you, pete. Like i said, it cost quite a bit, what with hotels and such. As a matter of fact, i made out an itemized expense account, just so you wouldn't think i was dishonest. Comes to exactly $155.80. Was he there? Don't rough me up walt because then i won't tell you anything. I'm your only link, you know, with the outside world. I'm listening. I'm counting. He was there, walt, with his missis, and he's a nice-looking boy. You could have phoned. It would have saved time. Yeah, but you can't collect money on the telephone. How long will it take to get there? By car? Oh, you ought to be able to make it if you drove all night. I'm against this, walt. Pete can bring him back. Uh-uh. That's out of my line. Al's going to the chair. Did you forget that? No, walt. I didn't forget. Well, i'm going to try and stop it, and you're coming with me. You, too, shorty. Man: All right, stay where you are, all of you. Shorty: Open up! Open up, walt! You dirty fink. You brought the cops. I didn't. You got to believe me, walt. I wouldn't do a thing like that. No, no. Now, don't be crazy, walt. I wouldn't bring the cops in. I'm not in on this. Ok, i'm letting you out. All right, open it up! Quick... give me a hand. Man: That bullet did a lot of damage, walt. Yeah. Yeah, i feel like a rag. Is he going to be all right, doctor? He'll be ok. If you don't trust me, go ahead and get a real doctor. Don't worry about me, doc. I'm not going to croak. Got too much to do. You'll not be doing anything for a couple of months. You'll be on your back. Couple of months? You got a big hole in you. Now, you better lie still, or i'm not responsible. I gave him a shot. He'll sleep now, whether he wants to or not. They tell me you and jan made every acre count this season. We didn't do so bad, i guess. It's those guaranteed seeds i sold you. That's right, simon. Your seeds and hard work. Understand you're going to be a papa any day now, eh, steve? That's right. Week or two, the doc says. Good! Good luck! Ha ha! Thanks, simon. Why, you dumb hick. Why don't you watch where you're going? If you yell loud enough, maybe you'll get a cop. Where's anne? She went up to her room. Eat something, stefan! Such a hurry! Anne: Hello, darling. We're leaving. Caught up with us. Who? Old radak and his mobsters. But, steve, you said- never mind what i said. There's no time to talk. They may be headed this way now. But the police said you were innocent. There was to be no more running away. Steve, you've been lying to me all the time. Darling, if i lied to you, it's because i wanted you to be happy, not scared half to death. I love you, anne. If i tell you we have to get out of here now, you've got to believe me. So that's why we've been running away. That's why you wanted to hide me in a safe place, because you were afraid of what might happen to me. They threatened to hurt you, anne. I was never afraid for myself. Oh, darling! Papa! We are getting visitors. Where is steve randall? Steve who? Listen, mother goose. Don't get cute with us. We know he's here. We saw the truck outside. Please, a little more respect. This woman is my wife, and this is my home. Any more out of you, and i'll give you a fat lip. Go ahead, take a look around. But i tell you there's nobody in- we are alone, my husband and i. Walt: Shut up! Sit down. There's nobody here, walt. Maybe we got the wrong joint. This is it, all right. Where did they go? When did they leave? I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe if we pushed you around a little, we'd get the answers. Reynolds: We're wasting time, walt. Let's get going. They can't have gone very far. Stevie. Driver. My wife's sick. Get to a hospital. - Why, she's going to have a baby! - Hey, she can't do that! It's again company regulations. Let's see if this manual explains what to do. I'll thell you what to do. Keep your hands on the wheel and step on the gas. - Please hurry to a hospital. - Okay, buddy. - Nurse, how is my wife? - Fine, just fine. Would you please tell her i love her and not to be afraid? - I'll tell her. - Thanks. First time? Yeah. My name is frank. Bill frank. Easy to remember. What's yours? Everybody thinks of automobile insurance after the collision, and everybody thinks about life insurance when it's too late. Nobody knows what's going to happen to them. You walk down an empty street, look both ways at every corner. Nothing in sight, and just like that... no insurance. That's a tragedy. But let me tell you about our monthly payment plan. You pay $9.00 the first of every month, and your wife and child collect $5,000 the minute the old ticker stops. Mr. Stevens. How's my wife? Almost as beautiful as your new baby daughter. Daughter? 6 pounds and 8 ounces. You can see her in about 5 minutes. Thanks. Congratulations, father. Now how about that insurance? Haven't got time. Not now. I know. You think it'll take time for the medical examination. Well, you're wrong. My brother-in-law is a doctor right here in this hospital, and he'll take care of it- hey, wait a minute. You mean that if i pass a medical examination and anything happens to me, my wife will collect $5,000 cash. Absolutely. All you have to do is sign on the dotted line. You know, in my 31 years of selling insurance, i never saw a better risk than you. I hope you're right. Anne: Now, see here, young lady. You've got to drink your milk, that is, if you want to go to california with your daddy and me. Oh, now. We're going to have our own gas station- steve randall's gas station. Oh, you like that, huh? Well, so do i. Come on. Here she is, manny. It's all yours. Ok, steve. And don't forget, night shift, starting tomorrow. All right with me, brother. I can sure use that extra dough. There's nothing wrong with that. So long. Anne: Is that you, steve? Oh, hello, darling. You look awfully pretty. Thank you. I was expecting the gas collector. I was talking to mr. Briggs, the real estate agent, today, and he said that gas station in california is a good buy for us. Do you know that the baby and i were talking about it? She likes the idea, too. No kidding. Mr. Briggs says it's a perfect location, besides having living quarters in the back, and that's very important to us right now. Oh, steve. Steve, that's wonderful. And just think, in another week or so, we'll have enough money for the deposit, and then you can send it right on to the owner. Well, i don't know, honey. Mr. Briggs said there's probably a hundred people after the place, and, well, being right there on the spot is better than sending the money. I don't think we should wait. We might lose it. Now, don't you worry about it. There'll always be another. Well, i'm not taking any chances. You're leaving today. Today? I have your bus tickets, and i drew the money out of the bank. Oh, but, steve- there's no buts about it, honey. There's a bus leaving at 8:00 tonight, and you're going to be on it. Steve, l- look, honey, tomorrow i start on the night shift, and you won't be seeing much of me anyway. Yes, but, darling, i thought we were going to go away together. I know. But look, i want you to go out and get the deal settled and fix the place up. I'll stay here and get a few more pay envelopes in my pocket, and then i'll join you, huh? Well, uh, there's nothing i can say, steve. There's nothing i want you to say. Honey, this is the chance we've been waiting for. Yeah. Man: Bus leaving for cedar city, las vegas, barstow, and los angeles. You be a good girl and don't talk to any strangers. I'll give you one month. 4 pay envelopes. Oh, steve, we couldn't stand it much more than a month. We love you so much. Ferrari: Very tender. Very touching. A nice kid you got, steve. They'll like it in california. Hello, mr. Ferrari. Your old friends radak and reynolds gave us quite a chase, but we know they're in town, and i want them. What about me? Oh, we don't want you anymore, steve. No? We almost caught walt a couple of months back, but he got away. We nabbed joe daly and a miserable little hoodlum named shorty abbot, who got himself shot. He told us all about you before he died. Oh, so now you know i'm innocent. That's right, steve. The d.a. Cleared you on all counts. Now, why don't you leave me alone? I guess all this running around in the cold and everything has got me kind of soft in the head, but i like you. If you like me so much, leave me alone. Wait a minute, son. Will radak and reynolds leave you alone? I've got to be around. Wherever you go, they go after you. Listen, ferrari. You saw me put my wife and kid on that bus. For the first time they're safe, and i don't have to run anymore. All right, you want to see walt and reynolds locked up? So do i. They're no longer interested in my wife, and they're too late to help al. All they want to do is get even with me. They're going to kill you if they can. Sure. They took a shot at me today. So i got a right to carry a gun, haven't i? That's right, steve. Your life's in danger. Go to the police station and get yourself a permit. Thanks. I'll see you around. Walt: Put him in that chair. Looks like it was loaded for a bear. I waited 6 months for this. Walt: Hello, steve. You should have known better, steve, than to try to get away from us. I wasn't trying to get away this time, walt. I was looking for you. You got something to tell me? Yeah. Yeah, i got something to tell you. You're too late. You're too late because they're going to burn al tonight, and you're too late because my wife and kid are someplace you can't touch them. All you've got is me. Right now you're all i want. In 15 minutes, they're going to throw the switch on al... and you're going with him, both of you at the same time. It's not very much to do for my own brother, but it's something. It's all i can do now, i guess. I guess al has already had his last dinner. You may as well have yours, too. Get the meal ready. Nothing here but milk and bread and some tired meat. Make some sandwiches. I'm sorry i can't give you a choice of food, steve, but it won't make much difference. You're not going to live long enough to get any nourishment out of it. You only get a good meal when the state pays for it. Isn't that right, steve? Well, you ought to eat some of it, steve. It's your last meal. I want you to have the same privileges they're giving al. Go on! Eat it. I'm not hungry. Have a smoke? Reynolds: Don't bother reaching. Oh, the clock's fast. Wouldn't want to cheat you out of 2 minutes. Al goes at 12:00... not a minute before. I want you to get all al is going to get. Is that your kid? I missed you at the hospital, steve. I never did know. Was it a boy or a girl? A girl. Congratulations. Who was it said time flies? Mrs. Stevens, it's mrs. Oliver. May i come in for a minute? Ok, let her in, but don't try anything. Hello, mrs. Oliver. Good evening. Oh, excuse me. I know it's late, but i saw your light under the door. We have some friends in, and i ran out of cream for the coffee. Oh, help yourself. Oh, isn't mrs. Stevens in? No. She left. She's visiting my mother. We're cousins. Mrs. Oliver: Now, that's not much of a meal for you men. I'd just assume bring down some cake for you and your friends. Steve: No, no. Please don't do that. Oh, we have plenty. Now, just let me take this upstairs, and i'll be right back down with that cake. Too bad. You can't do that, walt. She'll know too much. Look, walt, no use being crazy. Let's take him downstairs in the car. Yeah. Yeah, there's still 5 minutes left... and i don't want any interruptions at midnight. Come on. Get going. Ferrari: All right. Hold it. Are you all right, lieutenant? Ooh. Ooh! Go ahead and shoot, walt. You can't make me run anymore. You can't go much farther, walt. There's only the roof left. Policeman: All right. All right, folks. Go on back to bed. The excitement's over. Let's clear the hallway down here. I gave him a chance to give himself up. Hmm, you only fired one bullet, eh? Well, i heard 5 shots. Radak must have been taking potshots at ## you. Let's make a report, officer. Walt radak, while fleeing from the police, was shot to death on the fourth floor of 2107 sycamore avenue, mountain city. The fatal bullet was fired in self-defense by steve randall from a gun belonging to detective lieutenant louie ferrari. I might get a special citation for that. Say, lieutenant, he must have died right at the stroke of midnight. What date will i use? Toss a coin. Well, you're all clear, son. There'll probably be a hearing on this, but we'll straighten them out about you. Thanks. A policeman's work is never done. I'll probably be here 2 hours cleaning up. Well, go ahead, steve. You can go. Oh, steve. Yeah? Give my regards to your family. Thanks. Thanks. I'll do that.
