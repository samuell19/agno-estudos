Come onl well, she's got an attltude, but she's smart. - Fourteen? -just. Llnda was the same at that age. The thlng with daughters Is that you start out wanting to protect them, and then you end up reallslng that you can't. Dldn't thlnk you were that close to your children. When they're young, they don't Interest me, when they're old, they don't need me. Isn't that just a convenient way never to be Involved? Well, my parentlng skllls leave a lot to be deslred.

We've delayed recording because of a tle? It's not just because of a tle. It's about prlnclples. I was brought on this show to make changes. Yet whatever I suggest, he refuses to do. Gentlemen, I thlnk this ls a classlc example of maklng a mountaln out of a molehllL and this tle, that tle, really makes no difference to me. I would just llke to be shown the courtesy of belng asked In a pollte manner. YATES: HUN Please will you wear the tle I plcked out for you? Of course I will. Thank you. Now, can we all go back to work? You can be an awkward bugger when you want to be, Green. Be under no llluslon, Yates, you only got this job because I felt sorry for you. - You never hlred me. - I never objected to you belng hlred.
