An OFFICE SHIROUS presentation Why does Hara still play for The Tokyo Giants? Must be for the sake of his fans. I gues old baseball heroes never die. Well, it's no big deal. SOME KINDA LOVE I work in Kawate City Hall. I vet proposals for industrial developments... .. before they go for approval. Kanzaki has it easier than I do. This is the best plaace for the new road. Buying that land would be hard. We should go for this one. He's with the Urban Planning Department. Actually, he's its driving force. Land Development Department... Yes. Yes. Sorry, no, that's out of the question. We've been over this. What?... Yes. Sure, I have your namecard. Yes, yes... Goodbye. Yes... yes. Yes, same to you. That guy never gives up... He might make you an offer. - What?! That's dangerous talk! Just joking. That must be for you. Land Development Department... Yes. Yes. Anzai... It's Shibata Real Estate for you. Anzai speaking. Say again?... Shibata?! Long time no see! Hey, remember this? Sure! My watch. Did I give it to you? - Yeah. That year The Swallows won the League. - And you still wear it... You, me, and Shibada we all bet on the game. Ashtray? - Throw it out on the window. So, how's your work? And I bet on the losers?... - Yeah, you swore there was... - A foul! No doubt about it. - No, a home run. The Swallows got lucky. How much do you think? Aroound... 10 billion yen. You bought the lot? - Sure I did! See? We built the first 30 houses over there. I nearly went broke. Had trouble selling even half of them at the start. But I had a hunch and... .. stuck to it. Get the timing right... .. and you hit the jackpot! We're on the third phase now. I sometimes drop in... .. on my clients. I helped change their lives! Thanks to my hard work... .. they have their dream homes. Something wrong? - No. Mr Okamoto, I heard you were out here today. Mr Kawagoe told me I'd find you here. Busy, right? - Out of my way! That's not nice, is it? Wasn't meant to be. Mr Okamoto, see that man in my car? He's from City Hall. He says we need new houses for the growing population. See this? It's... .. a hamily heorloom I cherish. My job... .. is actually a kind of public service. Mr Okamoto... please help me do my job! Please! Well? How's the new urban planning project coming through? I don't know. I see... Are you free this evening? - Let's go for a drink. To renew our friendship. We had a lot of fun. One of my buddies... .. a guy named Shimada... .. a really good guy... .. knew nothing about drinking. And his father running a liquor store! He just turned out teetotal. Time's nearly up. C'mon... .. put the skirt back on. Don't rush me. I had a hard day... .. and now me and my buddy want a good time. Gimme a break. It's nice to think back sometimes. Isn't it? I guess. Shit, I just want to end the day feeling good! Got it? Get undressed! Not like that, do it again. How? Just do it like you mean it? May I take a shower first? - There's no need! You don't want me to? No, I don't mean that. Look... You can go. Don't be upset. It's not that I don't like you... - But... Are you sure? - Yes... but I... - No, I've been paid. - Is that so?... - Yes. - I'm sorry. - I'll be going, then. - Have a nice evening. - Thank you. Don't get me wrong... I do like women. You didn't like her? - No, no, it wasn't that. Shall we sit here? The usual for me. What are you having? Vodka tonic. Do you have aloe? Isn't that some kind of herb? No, aloe juice. It improves the taste. Got any? - Sorry, sir. - Will lemon do? - Fine. Coming right up, sir. She wasn't your type, huh? - It wasn't that. You make me feel as if I'm bribing you... But you aren't. We're friends. - That's right. Will you introduce me to your supervisor? Now you're trying to bribe me! - No, I'm not! Is that why you sent her away? No... yes. What am I saying?! Let me talk to your boss. - Nah... it won't work. - Why do you say that? - He's incorruptible. I'm not even supposed to hang out with you like this! Okay... Then, what about the head of Urban Planning? What's his name? C'mon, trust me! Trust you how? - There'll be no trouble, I promise. Well, he's name is Kanzaki. Oh, I don't know... What kind of woman'd be your type? Whisky and water, please. Put it on my tab, will you? Sorry, Ma'am, can't do that. Why not?! I'm a regular! Do it for her. Shibata! Why can't she? Right, why not? If you say so, gentlemen. Thank you. - Don't mention it. You come here often, Miss? Would you like to... .. join us? Maybe she's expecting someone. No, I'm alone. Sounds good to me. Please join us, then. Move her glass here. I'll pay for hers. I'm Shibata. Anzai. - Murakami Kiriko. I've seen you here before. You're a regular? - Yes, but... She doesn't know you. Kiriko, this is my first time here. He brought me. We met today. - After a long time. A class reunion? Renewing an old friendship. You live here? Strange we've never met. Thousands live here! Sure, but we do know lots of other people.... Kiriko, do you like this hair style? Modern? I'd say punkish. - Punkish?! - Suits you, though. - It does? Kinda shady. More like a scam-artist. I'll take that as a compliment. We're not much alike, but I know he's a good guy. Right, I'm a good guy. Sorry, didn't mean to spray you! This is cool! Okay? An odd couple. - Let's meet like this again. What's wrong with now? Now? Where to? - I know a place. Hear that? Let's follow her. Yeah, but... - But what? Sorry, I have to go. - No, we go together! Next time. He's married. So what? Got to business to do at home? You're staying and that's final! Give me some change. Number? Mine? - Yes, hurry. Okay. 34-6285. Who're you calling? Hello, Mrs Shibata? Glad to meet you. My name is Harukami Kiriko. I'm with your husband. He's asking if he can sleep with me tonight. Actually, we're already naked in a hotel room. And isn't he scrumptious! Hello, Anzai speaking! Remember me? Long time no see! Does he know your wife? Yes, we were at college together. Sounds nice. Stop it, Mr Shibata! This place we're going to... We can see UFOs there. - Great! Then it's UFO night! Bring some whisky! Let's make it a party! - We'll need whisky and glasses. UFO night! You heard. What're we doing?! - Quiet! Give me the bottle. Quick! Are you okay? Wait for me! - What're you doing? Evening, officer. What's going on? - Hide And Seek. What?! Here's my card, officer. My name is Shibata. Reminds me of an old song... "Mito Komono"! The "Mito Komon" theme! Am I out of tune? Stay with it, buddy! They're coming! They're coming! Lie down! Coming?... I can feel something. It's so beautiful... I'm getting drowsy. Will you concentrate? It may be gone... It may have gone. We're out of hooch. I guess we missed this one. I'll go buy some more. More? Okay, I'll go. Watch out for the guard. Don't worry... Give my regards to the UFOs. Lie on your back here. Don't move, okay? Attention! Stretch out your legs. What was that?! It's called "The Trust Game". Keep your eyes open and look into mine. You closed your eyes! - Interesting game... It's hard, isn't it? No! This is the trust game. Isn't it? Where has Anzai gone? Let's go somewhere else. Let's go. Anzai... Take me to his place! How about someplace else? - No, his place! - Let's go somewhere else. - I said his place! Is this it? "Trust" me. Let's go. - Listen... Let's go to a hotel. Anzai's place or nowhere. Can I see you again? Hurry up. Hurry up and move! Coming! Why didn't you come back? Where's Shibata? Your shoe... Come in, please. He kissed me and grabbed my breast. You have so many books... Please... can I get you coffee or...? Tea. What was the first book you read? "Ikkyu, the Little Monk" Really?... Please, don't! - Writing a novel?!... That's enough. I haven't finished reading. Aren't you going to ask what I think? What's the matter? Why don't you ask? Why don't you ask? - I don't... - You don't rate my reaction. - No... Sorry. It's just it's not finished yet. What do you think of it? - Give me a tissue. I'll tell you a riddle. What does 1.5 kilos of rice in a red bag make? I made up this riddle when I was a kid. No one's ever got it. 1.5 kilos of rice in a red bag?... Rice... I give up. I must go. See you. 8Let me borrow these. You must work on roller-skates. - I do my best. - The prospects loook good. - I think we can acquire the land. - Keep up the good work. - Yes, sir. Please copy this for me. Anza... - What? Shibata seems a hell of a guy. - Watch ot. - Why? That love-bite on your neck. Land Developmrnt Department... Speaking. Sorry?... Oh, it's you! Hitomi!... Long time no see! - Likewise... - Mrs Shibata now. - You haven't changed at all. I've put on weight; don't exercise like I used to. Sit down! - Here? - Have a hamburger. - You mean a hamburger! - Right! Okay, I'll give it a try. After all these years... .. this is my lunch. That call, the other night... Surprised? Sounded like you were having fun. We were just fooling around. Where did you go after that? Another bar. He came home, didn't he? Hell, I did it again... - Same old Anzai! - Some things never change. - Here you are. Thanks. There'll be a stain... About that girl and my husband... We just ran into her that night. - Why? - Nothing. We got friendly. That's all. - Is that why you callled me? - Of course not. Okay, then... Hello? - Hello? Is that the Anzai residence? - It is. - This is the Public Prosecutor's Office. Do you know the real-estate dealer Shibata? Yes, I do, Shibata speaking. You scared the hell out of me! A this time in the morning. Morning?! It's midday! Come on, we're driving to a cottage I own. - It'll be fun. - Sorry. I'm not in the mood. Get it together! Come on Anzai, wake up! What's going on?!... Come see... I waited three days to ambush her at that bar. Anzai, your bag! - I'll take it. - Thanks. I love this, it's so romantic! - Come in. A fireplace! Let's light a fire! Okay... Wear the slippers! - A lot of space... - Anzai, put them on! - Is this your place? - It's for sale. Want to buy it? - I couldn't afford it! - You could. Where's the kitchen? - Over there. Okay... I'll cook tonight. Leave everything to me. Are you sure? Anzai, why not take Kiriko for a walk? Listen... What? Tell me... - What? - 1.5 kilos of rice in a red bag... Got the answer? Actually... no. D'you think Shibata can cook? What do you think of my writing? I think you're scared of being hurt. There's a place near here you can see UFOs. Let's take a look after dinner. Listen... - What? Do you see Shibata often? What do you do? Do you work? Are you going out with him? I'm going out with you, too. It's me. Raise the cash early next week. About a billion yen. I'm sure the city plans to build on Okamato's land. I have a strong hunch. Of course the money's just for show. I'm at the cottage. With the guy from the City Hall... Just get the cash! Dinner is served! Look at that! - My God! Smells delicious! Let me at it! Tastes good too. Anzai, it's time you learned about wine. I have my own vineyard in France. Once you have the taste, nothing else will do. My vintners send me only the best bottles. One bottle every five years. Where's the bottle? - Okay, we'll open it after this. I don't have it now. What?! I don't believe this! It's a rare vintage, as I said. So, after all that, you don't have it! Help yourself to more! No, thanks, I can't stop now. Right, keep going. Time for the penality game. I must go to the bathroom. The game can wait. That's not fair!... About Kanzaki... Thanks for the help. I didn't do much. Don't thank me yet... I mean, nothing's confirmed yet... .. is it? What do you know? Nothing, really. Let me make it clear... I have nothing to do with the plans. Why d'you say that?... What are you gettiing at? - Listen... - You know something. - No, I told you! I'm just warning you against snap decisions. I've been working on this really hard. Come on, out with i t! - I don't know! Getting me here it's all part of your scheme. You're using me... Damn right I am! Whre're you going?! I don't like you! Sorry. I was wrong. Don't worry about it. Let's have another drink. Step on it! I'll close my eyes! Careful! Keep your hand on the wheel! Keep going! Go, go, go! Don't excite her! What the hell, let's go for it! I'm feeling something unusual. Look! Right above my head! The orange light by those three stars. It's moving! - There! - Right! - See? - It's moving! It's an UFO! Where? - There! - See that orange one? - Oh, yeah... That?! There must be others, let's find them! Yeah, let's do it! It might be a satellite... - Have you ever seen one? - Not really. It's an UFO! Yes it i s! You may be right... Here comes another one! See? I told you! - So that's an UFO!... - Let's name it! - I should... - What? I should go... I'm expecting a call. What are you on about?! - Will you run me to the station? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong. Don't go home. You're not leaving! - Sorry. You're not leaving, no way! We're staying together tonight! Anzai... As I was asking you before... About Kanzaki. Are you hiding something from me? Can I trust you? You must see... Being a speculator is hard. But getting it right is like hitting a home run Are you asleep? Keep warm or you'll catch cold. I'm fine. Are you sure? I thought you weren't coming back. But that wouldn't be so bad. Listen... My feet are cold, please tuck the blanket under them. I couldn't get Kiriko out of my mind. You know Mr Shibata? - Yes, in a way. - Business partner? - Sort of... What line of work are you in? Let's say it's a solid business. - You don't look lke a banker. - He could be a doctor. You're single, right? Me too! I'm available. Can I sit there? You like her? Of course, she's younger... But I'm afraid you can't have her. You're so cute! Come on, say "aah"! - Excuse me, I'm being called. - Have fun! We three beauties are still here. Cheers! Let me still here. What took you so long? Something confidential?... No, no. Shibata... - The project may work out well. - Really? That's great. So let's have some fun! You said it! Mr Okamoto... Please, listen. It's for the town's future. Just take a look... I've brought the money. Mr Okamoto... It's me. Get a private detective on to Okamoto. There's no other choice. Hi. - Hi, honey. - What are you doing? - It feels good outside. - Join me? - Why not? A woman called Kiriko called. She's looking for an apartment. She asked me to come to her party. I'm helping her find a place. Who is she? Who is she... Hey, look... Remember this? I bought this when we got married. I've worn it ever since. I've never fooled around. - The phone... - Let it ring. Shibata speaking. Yes. Fine, I'll be there. Going out now? - I'll be right back? - When? Dunno... soon. Was that Kiriko? Hey, your watch! How's Anzai? Seen him lately? Not recently. I sort of miss him. I think we're good together. Let's talk about us. What? What's the matter? I have to go. Listen, we get along well. I understand you. Hey. Hey! This is it. Drive on. Drive on! "MURAKAMI DENTAL CLINIC" What's wrong? Come here. I'm bored... Sit there. - Why? - I'm turning you into a man. - Don't! This is a moustache... Don't move! You lost the game, this is your penalty. Look right... that's good. Know what? You're lucky you can write. What do you mean? You can be anybody, go anywhere. Where do you want to go? God, it's cold! Stop it! I'm ticklish there! Anazai!... These are yummy! Come and try! Can you hear me! Anzai! Quick, is there a car outside? A car?! A black car just went past. What about it? I went to a wedding reception today. I hate those things. I shouldn't have gone. The guy in that car is looking for you? I don't want to see him. Who is he? My husband. I'm married, you know. I really am! You can call this number and ask. They'll tell you. - I don't think so. - Try. Just do it, will you! Let's eat out. Get changed, that's a party dress. Kiriko was so enigmatic. But we became quite close. "Naganuma Real Estate" It's me... Any messages? What about Okamoto's family? Check them too. Did Murakami call? See you. There's a surcharge for extra time... Did Murakami call? I see. Shall we order? Father, will you have a beer? Is this the Murakami Dental Clinic? I see... May I speak to Mrs Murakami Kiriko? Sorry to bother you. We were supposed to be meeting now. Anzai is the name. I see... Are you her father? Her husband... She's married?... Ah, of course... Oh, nothing! Thank you, Mr Murakami. Good evening. There you are... Give me my usual. You're... a regular here now. Yes, I am, Try some aloe juice. - Not for me. - Give me another glass. Liquor's bad for you, and that stuff makes you drink more. - No, thanks. - Try some. - No, thanks. - Try it! Take my word for it: aloe on its own is foul... .. but vodka makes it taste fruity. Just try a sip! You dope! Trust me this once... Try it! No, thanks. You make things so difficult! How so?! You don't accept challenges. - Leave it out! - Take my advice, for God's sake! It's really good. I won't. - Just for me. - See? - It's terrible. - What're you doing this Sunday? - Nothing special. - Round of golf? - Don't think so. Why not? You'll be free. I don't want to be a drag. Can't you keep a friend company when he asks You're not sociable at all! Like now... You were drinking alone... Didn't mean to leave you out. Tell me, how's business? Not bad, thanks to you. You impressed Kanzaki. Glad to hear it. Good evening. Bourbon on the rocks. Kiriko is married... .. to a dentist. I see. You're not surprised? I see... You think it's no big deal... .. because you just fooled around with her. That's absolutely not true. What's got into you? You have her number? Tell me! - Why? - Just tell me. - Why should I? - C'mon, it's just a phone number! - Just a phone number?! - Anzai, I need it! - No. - Okay, then you cal her. - To say what? - Do it for me! - Why? - Just do it! - Why should I call her?! - I have something to tell her. - No, you don't. - Do me a favour, will you? - Don't give me that! - C'mon, Anzai, please call her! - Alright, alright. All you have to do... .. is dial the number and let me talk. Good, no? I wanted to forget about Kiriko. Loo at these, Mr Okamoto. You seem to be enjoying your relationship... .. with this restaurant owner. Could affect your son's wedding if it came out. Think it over... .. and let me know what you decide. It's me. I think Okamoto's land is sewn up. The dentist's number? I want to see Kiriko. - Is the dentist in? - Yes, he's with a patient... - Are you Kiriko's husband? - Yes. - Where is she? - She's out. - I'll wait, then. - Feel free. I'm sorry. It's hot in here. She'll be back very late. I'll wait. Is that Kiriko? What do you think? If she's done something wrong, I apologise. No, I just need to her. I do apologise. Please forget about her. It isn't the first time this has happened, is it? What is your name? Shibata. Mr Shibata... Never mind. To be honest... .. I don't know what to do with her. Why don't you divorce? Aren't you unhappy? I have to go. Make yourself at home. Yes, that's Kiriko. May I take your picture? Excuse me?! Just one. Ready? It's my hobby... Thanks a lot. What? - We have to go somewhere. - Why? - Let me take you. - No. - It won't take long. I'm feeling sick. I'm going to throw up! Hold on! Some nerve you have! Coming to my home! Please... Let's just see this place. So? Fantastic! This place is for UFOs. I bought the rooftop. It's at your disposal. You don't believe in UFOs! I'll buy that hill too... .. and build a hut there for you. I believe in having fun. Don't let me go! I hadn't seen them for a month. Then I got a call from Shibata's wife. - Do you come here often? - Never before. I divorced Shibata. What?! Don't be so surprised. Come on, let's dance. Are you alright? Lie there. I'll bring you some water. You're sweet. Hello? Anzai speaking. Really?! Thank you. When will that be? I see! That's great! Thank you so much! I made it! Can I speak to Kiriko, please? She's left?... I see. Please give me the number. Fine. Thanks a lot. Kiriko and Shibata were living together. I told them a literary monthly had accepted my story. "Real Estate Contract" "Signed by N. Okamoto and T. Shibata" Shibata's business was apparently prospering. I'm telling you, the project went very well. - I'm glad. - That cottage is adorable! - I'll get you one like it. - You mean it? - Sure I do, it'll suit us fine. - You really mean it?! - I'm happy for you, Anzai. - Yes, congratulations. Thanks. Actually, Kiriko inspired me a lot. You bet I did! You owe me a hut on the hill! Good idea! - Your face is kind of scary. - You're so unkind! - Don't turn round. - Stop being mean to me! I'm afraid nobody will buy the issue with my story. - Of course they will! - Have faith in yourself, Anzai! If you tell a lie often enough it becomes the truth. - I'll carry those. - Just take this. I miss your apartment... Can I visit you again? Don't know about that. - Why not, Anzai? - I didn't mean it. - What's wrong with you? - Like I said, I didn't mean it. You're both welcome anytime. I'll go in first! Hey, the key! If she and I broke up, what will she do next? Don't say that, it might happen. She says she'd go back to her husband. He still gives her money. Are you going to be okay? Yeah... I think we'll make it. Come on! Anzai, congratulations on your tour de force! Let's drink to your debut as a published writer. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Cheers! - Cheers! - I'm very happy! - It's really great. - I hope you liked my story. - I'll read it soon. You haven't read it? I knew it! Hello! - Hello! You're all friends? So are we. Why don't we all sit together? The more the merrier, eh? May I sit here? We're good friends. We should make this party one to remember! You're like a cute little puppy! So pert! That's nice! - Please, stop that! Hey, Anzai, everybody! - I've got this cottage. - Yes! Let's go! It's beautiful! Don't worry, he's the host. We got plans... Why don't we all take a bath together? Excuse me, is there a problem? I'd hate to have to ask you to leave... I'm just chatting them up! What about it? Here we are. - You're sure this is it? Here you go... Take these. Let's get with it here. Put them in a circle. - Okay, I have them here. How's this? Make a perfect circle! Is that alright? - Hold this! - Alright. Ready? - Hey, we should look up! - Yes, we should! - Isn't that one there? - Where? That orange thing? The one that's moving? We're here! We're Earth people! Fly down to us! Come on down! It was the best moment in all our lives together. Kanzaki... what's up? Ah, yes... Well... The project's been green-lighted... Oh, really?... But... There's one problem. It's not on Shibata's land. But you were so positive!... Yes... But things changed... Changed?!... Anzai... Do me a favour. Tell Shibata for me. Why me?... Please, do it for me! Please! "Property of Shibata Real Estate" Anzai... I want to buy you a gift. What?! No! Why? For introducing me to Kanzaki. No need. Tell me what you want. A fountain pen? Golf clubs? No, thanks... I mean it. Don't bring me down! C'mon, give me a break. By the way, how's Kiriko? She's okay. I can leave that land idle... .. and sell it later. By the way, who's handling the next development? No idea. All right... Let's move on. This place bores me. Let's go find some women. - Let's drink tonight! Okay? - Maybe... - What's bothering you? - Nothing, I'm fine. - Then what are we waiting for? - Let's go. - Had a goood time today, Anzai! - Me too. - Let's drink some more! - Yeah, let's go for it. Maybe I should go now. - You're still loaded. - Tell you what... Let's go get some women! Give us a break, you're tone deaf! Sing like you mean it! You need a bit of soul! Hey, please! Sorry, keep going! What's that supposed to mean? Sorry, mister... Let's sing it together. Going out again? - Can't sleep. Is that why... .. you hit the bottle? What is it you want? Come on. Stay with us tonight. Let's go on the hill, to spot UFOs, okay? Cut the crap! What're you trying to do? Where're you going?! Wake up, why don't you?! Close the door. It's alright. She'll be back, ayway. Kiriko never came back to Shibata. Three days later he was arrested on charges of bribery and blackmail. Shibata served a one-year sentence. After that, he disappeared. I still work in City Hall... .. and still write fiction from time to time. I ran into Kiriko. She said she missed Shibata. She didn't say much about herself. I hope she's happy. Tell me... Did you ever truly like me? - I saw a UFO the other night. - Was that three days ago? - Yeah... - I saw it too! - Really?! - Yes. - So it was a UFO... - Nobody believed me, thoguh... - Actually, I didn't tell anyone. - Why not? I was afraid of seeming stupid. - See you. - See you.
