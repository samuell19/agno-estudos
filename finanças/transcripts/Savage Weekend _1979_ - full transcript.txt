Greg is late. Apparently, it's not getting find the building. I was terrible when I saw him last week. A few months ago he left the hospital. Jeremy, your father will arrive shortly. Put your shoes on. They're in the kitchen. Let's go boy. Let's get ready. Hey! Who is the broker ... ... that Robert will take with us on the weekend? A friend. Will help Robert with the boat. I think your father is here. - Who pays the rent? - Me. Daddy! Come on, tiger! Jeremy felt his this week. How it feels? Less depressive? I went to talk to a guy about a job in ... ... Ministry of Health in Washigton. - That's great, Greg. - That was on Tuesday. Yesterday they gave the job the other person. - Something else will appear. - There, Dad. Robert, this is my husband Greg. Greg, this is Robert Fathwood. We have seen each other before in Legislative Assembly. He was there with the Governor Beech. Hey, Jeremy! This should be for you! Get your hands off my son! Let's go. My friend Jay is waiting in the car. Oh yes! Your friend! Shirley's toy for the weekend, huh? Let's wait until Greg go away, right? An oasis! I don't know about you, girls. But I will drink something. Nicky, stop teasing Jay. He has problems with his wife. And who doesn't? Do you think my life is easy? I don't escape my lovers not even in the bathroom! - A Dry Martini. - How do you do this? - Do you have gin? - Yes, I have gin. Put a little bit on a beautiful cup for me. Vermouth? Two olives. What the hell is that? I think I'll buy this for Nicky. It won't do. The rain is coming. There goes my tan weekend! The new moon arrived in the wet. How is it? When it's a curve like that, it's a wet moon. A hunter should hang your gun on it and go fishing. - Would you do it? - Yes. But when she gets curve like this ... ... he has no way hang the gun. You have to take it with him and go hunting. It means that the month will be dry. You should say that to the man the time of Channel 11. Hey Ryan, I thought you wouldn't allow swimsuits here. It suits him, doesn't it? Sweet talk, not with me. I'm after something. I bet I got what you want. How about you, Ryan? Also have? - Can believe. - Really? I think I know exactly what it is. Let me see... I bet it's a little thing ... ... that your mother sucks at night ... ... before I put you to bed. Get up, baby! Let's go! Stand up! Want me to stay lying here? Let's go! Okay, get the hell out of here. Okay, heart. If you take another step, I make a bloody mary with his face. Good boy, good boy. I wasn'tt raised in the Bronx! - Robert? - What? - What the hell is that? - A bat! A bat? Do not move. It looks like someone nailed it. Would you move if anyone preach it? I would live to see this. Someone made a joke. Let's get him out of there. - Don't touch that! - Give me a glove, please. Do not worry. It's some prankster. I'll get the gloves. - Marie! Shirley! - What's it? There are two power switches light near the door. The bottom is on. Turn on the top one, please. Thank you. I always forget that basement switch. It won't hurt. Don't bring him here. I thought pretty girls got to eat that for breakfast. I'll have to scent my hands for the rest of my life. Obviously this is something of some child here. We will not leave this screw it all. I found it delicious! He should have connected and ordered. Hello? This is Robert. I will go at the weekend ... ... could you deliver me a dead bat? In case I haven't arrived, tell me to nail it to the door. - Shut up! - Thank you very much. That son of a bitch don't care about your boat. You just want to decorate it and sell it. Maybe let it sink in the water. Yes, that's probably it what is he going to do. Yes, it will sink! You know, you say he will sink with all that cement ... ... but I don't believe it! A boat made of cement and wire mesh will float? You must think that I was born yesterday, Clarence! I didn't move it much since I buried you. But, what I did would make you all proud. Anyway, it is no longer yours, nor mine. It's his! I don't even know what I'm capable of, if he takes it from me. As far as I know, the place of this boat is here. In the barn. And it will continue here. Exactly as it is. Look, the people here are very closed. They are very restrained. Winter here is very bad. About 30 to 40 degrees under zero. Nothing to do except cut firewood and throw it in the furnace. Living locked up like this, makes the solitary Man... When lonely, people get weird. Whenever you meet people closed like the ones I said ... ...Be alert. Frustration is what motivates all the violence. But there is an answer to all that frustration. And the answer is ... What will it be? Come on, everyone knows what it is! It's Jesus! It's Christ! Jesus our Lord and Salvador! Join him and they won't horrible things. Nobody wants to be mean, but the evil resides in us. Let's face the facts. We have to do something. We have to subdue the demon and its evils. That Otis Crump who works on your boat. He's a very strange guy. 2 or 3 years ago before his mother dies ... ... a cousin came to visit them. Otis fell in love with her, but the girl had other ideas. I used to go to Oasis, that road 22 bar. I don't know what I was doing there, but Otis did not like that. Then, one morning she came back still at dawn. And Otis was waiting for her. He shouted: "Ordinary! Ordinary" And marked an "H" on her chest. - Why an "H"? - For "Ordinary". Otis is not very smart. Didn't know the word it started with the letter "O". You're talking about Otis, who works on Robert's boat? - Yes. Otis. - My Otis! Well, I'm going to take a look at service that I passed to Otis. Is anyone going to swim? If God had me made for swimming ... I know, you would be more like with a fish than it already is. Jesus! Is there a knife there? It would be easier if I did. No way! Are you sure you don't want do I do this for you? Well, keep fishing for dinner. I go to the barn. Let me take you. If I had a woman like you... ...for sure, I wouldn't leave you alone. Jealousy is stupid. It's human. My ex-husband already told me provided enough. I don't need this anymore. - Have you been married before? - I have a small son. I never saw him around here. Stay with dad on the weekends. Is his father a broker too? He was press officer of the Governor Beech. I don't understand politics, but I think the newspapers ... ... pursued this man until suicide. Governor Beech did not it was worse than the others. There was no reason for this man to kill himself that way. I should have done this before. Before destroying people, like my husband. Heard about the boat by the same woman ... ... who sold you the home last year. The old man who built it died. Spent more than you thought to finish it. Had to do a second home mortgage. I don't think it will recover the money ... ... but I hope that don't miss the house. - That's it! - What? The barn where the boat is being built. It doesn't look like it from the outside. Is nothing missing? Water! We are 200 miles of the ocean. We just need to get to the Hudson, which is half a mile. Have you tried to navigate half a mile on the asphalt? Let's get out of your way. Follow me. Robert, what a mess! did nothing than I sent, Otis! Watch out. There are wire screens on all sides. This is my friend, Jay Alsop. He will work on the boat with you. What are you going to do? Isn't he charming? God, look at this! I'm sorry, Otis. But I can not waste more time. - I don't waste time, sir. - Jay will help you. I do not need help. - Can I get on it? - Sure, he can handle you. Thank you for your help. It will have to be that way. He will stay here after i go back to the city. I thought you were a man smart, sir. But, it is not very smart. It will have to rain for 40 days and 40 nights ... Before you can take this ark from here. If it doesn't work, he can do... ...a restaurant of seafood. - You fool. - Here comes the prodigy boy. - This guy is disturbed. - Who? Otis? What is Robert doing? Showing him that he didn't is desired. Otis doesn't even believe that will float ... ... after you put the cement. And how will it fluctuate? Like the others. Water displacement. - I understand. - I doubt it. Nobody likes smart guys. You can't build a battleship with raft stick. I thought so! Said if I didn't work under Jay's supervision ... - ... wouldn't work anymore. - What did he say? Spit the chewing tobacco and he was staring at me. The son of a bitch did that. I brought a smart guy from town to take my place. My place, Clarence! I mean it won't nothing left for us. I'm glad not is alive to see them ... ... jump on the boat like dogs behind a bitch in heat. You would kill them. I know. Of course there is that his wife, Clarence. It is very beautiful. Never seen one that woman. Except those you told me. I've never seen any of them. Clarence, that one woman is one thing. It makes me have a lot of ideas. - What do you think of Mac Macauley? - He's a nice guy. But I don't know if trust him a lot. - Because? - Do not know. - Does he scare you? - If he scares me? It tells such horrible stories. He's just an Irishman like most here. They like their own imagination. Blood and everything. But they are basically harmless. Hold me close, Robert! - Who is she? - Is my sister. I don't know what your father did ... ... but it sure did beautiful children. Robert asked to ask if you will come tonight. I think so. He wants to talk to you. What you want? Do not know. See this? That's what Is playing. Me and Ryan have plans for those people. They will do nothing without my order. As if! See how you talk to me, do you hear? Things happen around me... ... and I have no control! But the worst part is that I don't feel it. What don't you feel? Anything. Pain, jealousy, anger, sadness, love. Except fear. Ah, how scared I am. I was so numb with what happened to Greg. There he is. So? It will take another half day, before we can see something. Will it finish in time? It all depends on the job of joinery. If measurements and fittings are correct ... We can finish four weeks from now. - Did you call your wife? - No, why? Well, there is no bar for singles in the region. But, there's Otis! - Let's swim? - Maybe later. Fine. Let's go! You won't get me! Wait! - Finally alone. - To do what? Whatever we want. Hey, there's something about you. Do not move. I'll get. Do not move. I can't believe you did that. Listen, why we don't do something ... Dirty! Where are Jay and Shirley? Do not know. It's been a while I don't see them. Every time I turn around, I see a nymph. - I need some eggs. - It's ok. Have you ever tasted fresh milk? No, please. I'm doing my nails. Come on, I know you liked it. Leave me alone! What did I do? Tell me. You really are a pig! I am not surprised that his woman has left you. What happened to you all of a sudden? She stayed with you for 3 years! When you approached me in the woods, I thought: "Here's a guy full of imagination!" Then, I noticed that there it was just a poor thing ... ... who seeks inspiration in pornographic magazines. Then that's it. You can play now, girls. You know, this disguise is a great nonsense. Brokers are also have fun, don't you, Robert? Only when they are counting money. - Where's Jay? - He's angry outside. - Didn't they stop fighting? - Your friend is an asshole. What's up dear? I think I better look for Jay. The last time I saw him, was going to the barn. Thank you. You are being too sentimental. I think I left that political roll ... ... all that confusion with Greg blinds me. Robert has nothing to do thereby. He is a broker as a friend idiot of him ... - ... and the difference is minimal. - Robert is not corrupt. It is affectionate and human. And I will try to love you. - Nicky and his bird! - I'll toast it. Oh, vegetables! It looks like our broker went out to dinner today. I think we should wait a little. If we do that, I will play this bird ... ... in the beautiful white dress someone. Maybe he just wants to stay a little alone. - Thigh? Thigh? - I've always liked thighs. I like breast. - Maybe it's him. - Who? - Jay. - He wouldn't knock on the door. Maybe it's the impaler bats. Sorry for interrupting your dinner. The keys are in the car. It's Mac Macauley. - Who? - The lumberjack. One who eats stumps in the breakfast. - You came through the woods. - Yes. - Didn't you see my friend Jay? - No. He must have taken another course. - I bring the car after the movie. - No problem. Excuse me. - Why did it? - What? - Give him the car? - He asked me this afternoon. His broke and promised take the daughter to the cinema. But we ran out of transport. We weren't going anywhere at all. Maybe he'll come back to do bad games. Maybe Jay has gone to one of those shacks. Let's take a look? Do not worry. He will come back. Wait a minute. Maybe he is there. I'll wait here. Hey, I don't have to try. I love you for months. Nicky? Marie! Jay hanged himself. Who are you? Help! Help! I do not know what you want! Who are you? Marie! Oh my God! Why? Where's Jeremy? Where's my son? You're safe. What did you do? Daddy you don't have to return the car? I'll take you to home first. No need to lose anymore sleep than necessary. - I do not care. - I know that is not. But I care. It was the laughter. Everyone laughed at me. Don't laugh when we had the power! At that time they were jealous. They reeked with envy. I could see it in their eyes. You could feel it in them. They hated the governor. They hated the power we had. But they flattered us. All of them. They sat like dogs out of my office ... ... scratching the door looking for leftovers! - Daddy? - What? I can go with you? The movie scared me. Let's do something? We are not going there today. I will return the car in the morning. They won't need of the car before that. That's right! I couldn't live with impotence. Impotence. Soon it will be dawn. Let's go to the lake. It's beautiful there. And let's get that rowing boat. Let's go to the middle of the lake, where it's deep. When we get there, I'm going to set the boat on fire. Hello! Is there anyone at home? Mac! Mac! Help!
