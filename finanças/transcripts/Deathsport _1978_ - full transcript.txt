(electronic swooshing music) (ominous music) (melancholy music) - [Narrator] A thousand years from tomorrow, after the Great Neutron Wars, the world consists of desert wastes and isolated city states. A few machines remain as a reminder of the past, but only the city-dwelling Statemen use them. Between the cities roam the dreaded cannibal mutants and the Range Guides. Guides are legendary warriors leading an independent nomadic life, owing allegiance only to their code. (electronic whirring) - Do not go to him. Wait for him to come to you. (tense music) (zinging) (thudding) (groaning) (tense music) (zapping) (yelling) - Like sand in the wind. - Keep moving. Flush him, do not charge him. You'll have no chance against him then. I want him alive. (zapping) (yelling) (tense music) - Statemen. (funky electronic music) - Machines advance and take him. (rumbling) (zapping) (blasting) (footsteps clomping) (electronic music) We've achieved our goal today, my lord. We've captured four Range Guides and in the combat lost only two Death Machines. - Only two. You think that's an accomplishment? If they destroy the Death Machines in the the Death Sport, it could be catastrophic. Can't you understand? People must be made to believe that riding a Death Machine will make them as powerful as a Guide. We must build that confidence. It is crucial to the war effort. - I cannot say that no machine will be lost in the Death Sport, my lord. But I can absolutely guarantee that not one Guide will survive. - Your life is your guarantee to me, Ankar Moor. Never forget that. Now, I must have at least one more Guide. Female, to fight in the Death Squad. - That will be an extra thrill. - Perhaps you can manage to capture a female Guide without losing any more Death Machines? - The most powerful Guide of all was a female, my lord, defeated by Ankar Moor. (tense music) - [Deneer] Keep moving. (zooming) (rumbling) (zooming) (horse whinnying) (tense music) - [Adriann] Tara, stay close to me. (zooming) Do you recognize them? - [Deneer] No, but they might be mutants. - [Man] Are they mutants? - [Deneer] Get back to your people. - Well, shouldn't we try to outrun them? - [Deneer] I said get back to your people! (horse whinnying) - They're on the fly, just ahead. (zooming) - It's mutants, alright. We better make a run for it before it's too late. - People, dismount. Form a circle. Off your horses. Immediately, dismount. Everybody, off your horses. - Tara, stay with the Statemen 'til I come for you. Do you hear me? - I won't stay. I wanna go. - [Adriann] No, ya! (zooming) - The first three are mine. - [Adriann] Be powerful, Deneer. - [Deneer] Ya! (dramatic music) (zooming) (zapping) (zooming) - Adriann! (zapping) (dramatic music) (screaming) Adriann, Deneer! The mutants! (screaming) Adriann! (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) (clanking) (groaning) (zooming) - [Deneer] Ya! - [Man] You must form a a single line and return to Helix City immediately. Move quickly! - But I'm supposed-- - [Man] Form a single line-- - I'm supposed to be in Tritan. - [Man] And move to Helix City. - [Tara] Adriann, Deneer! Ah! (somber electronic music) (grunting) (thudding) (screaming) - I am a Guide! I am my only master! Who put me in here? - [Man Over Speaker] The next time you touch that door, you'll get a jolt you won't forget. (zapping) Stand by your cell door, Range Guide and stay quiet. (melancholy electronic music) - [Tara] Adriann, Deneer! - We take care of our own. I'll help you find her when we are free from here. Our union is limited. - [Deneer] I agree. - I know you. We traveled together. - Yes, some time ago, to Tritan. I knew Oshay, your mother. I was with her last year when she died. She fought well. She was truly powerful. - I had not heard. Each of us is alone when he dies. (tense electronic music) - [Man Over Speaker] Dr. Karl, report to Lord Zirpola immediately. - [Lord Zirpola] How serious is it? - I believe you're a dying man, my lord. - Are you certain? - I'm as certain as I can be. - What do I have? - I don't know what to call it. It's cause is probably related to long-term radiation exposure. I've never seen anything like this before. I believe that you are losing control of your reasoning faculties. - You mean I'm going mad? - Your brain is decaying, my lord, and I must tell you, for the good of Helix, I think that you must turn over the leadership of state to someone else while it's still possible for you to do so. - Yes, of course. Come with me. (tense electronic music) Liar, you goddamn liar. How dare you frighten me with your stupid lies? There's nothing wrong with me, nothing! Arrest this man! You are condemned to Death Sport. (tense electronic music) (heavy breathing) - Do you know why they have taken us? - [Deneer] To fight in Death Sport. - Death Sport, that is a Stateman game, why us? - I do not know. - We have union. We will break together. - Yes, Kaz Oshay. (zapping) (screaming) (laughing) - I told you to be quiet in there. You better learn to listen to me unless you're enjoying this. (zapping) (screaming) You bastards! You're really gonna get it. (zapping) (screaming) (laughing) - Stop that! You know they've got to be able to fight! Why the hell do you think we've captured 'em? - Yes, (mumbling) just getting disciplined. - Well don't do it again, unless you have my permission. Unless you wanna join 'em. - Yes, sir. - Put him in cell number one. (thudding) (groaning) - They want to silence me. Zipola is going mad. He's going to war with Tritan for their fuel. We've got to stop him. We can't have another war. (laughing) People don't know that he's dying of brain disease. They believe everything he tells them. Tomorrow, he's gonna tell them that they must go to war for fuel to survive. - You Statemen, who do not even know how to live with your word can never have acknowledged to know peace. (laughing) - [Dr. Karl] If only my son hadn't left for Tritan, he'd help us escape and stop the war. - [Kaz Oshay] We must break or die. - Yes, Kaz Oshay. (melancholy music) - [Man Over Speaker] Even permits are canceled. In the state of emergency, certain top officials have been arrested for treason and sentenced to Death Sport. - Damn them. - [Dr. Karl] Do you know what the Death Sport is? - I have heard of it. - It's a tactic that Zipola's used to keep their power. Zipola has abolished the death penalty. Condemned criminals now fight each other in Death Sport. The winners go free, the losers die. - [Man Over Speaker] Attention prisoners! Stand by your cell doors. Stand by your cell doors immediately. (beeping) - Who are you? Tell me your name. - My name is Deneer. And yours is Ankar Moor. - Yes, you do not approve of my name? - Everything is within the self. Nothing is outside. It is known that you have lost yourself. Ankar Moor is a man without a soul, name to be despised. - Ankar Moor stands free. You stand there enslaved by him. - I am my only master. Take away my body and my soul will still be mine. - You are lucky. Today I still need you. What is your name? - A name I can be proud of, Kaz Oshay, son of Oshay. - Seed Oshay. I knew your mother. - Yes. She gave you your disgrace, Ankar Moor. You who betrayed the consciousness. Your dishonor is legend. - My dishonor is your fantasy. What is real Kaz Oshay is that now I can return to you a better gift than your mother gave to me. Your death in the Death Sport. (ominous electronic music) Starting at dawn, feed them disorientation. - I've already arranged it. - Your mother was Oshay? I always thought Oshay was a myth. - She was powerful. - It is said that she could just feel the air and know even days in advance that a flash wind was coming off the waste. Could she really do that? - Yes. - Can you? - Sometimes. (clanking) - Alright, stand back to the far wall. Hands held high, your feet spread wide, your backs to me. Now move it. You, move on back unless you wanna get jolted back there. - You Statemen act very brave on the far side of that door. - Cover me. (growling) - Freeze. (thudding) (groaning) - I'll be back. (zapping) - [Man] No, no, ah! (zapping) (beeping) - [Kaz Oshay] Sealed us in! - Kaz? - Guards have put a field up on the outer door. Tried to blast it but failed. - [Man] Our union is limited. - [Kaz And Deneer] I agree. - I see no other way out of here. - No, don't. The main fuel line for the city runs above us. It'll explode. - As far as beneath us? - Stone. (alarms beeping) - Now the Guides broke from their cells. They freed the Statemen prisoners. But they all remain inside the prison compound. - [Lord Zirpola] The gas canister ready? - [Ankar Moor] They're being readied now, my lord. (electronic music) - This is my son. He came to free me. - He's lucky I did not kill him. - That's the only shared wall. There's a corridor on the far side, but I don't think that a hand blaster can cut through, it's five feet thick. - [Kaz Oshay] Where does it lead? - It's somewhere in the Obedience Force Headquarters. More than that, I don't know. - We'll fire together, one at a time. Ah, get them out of here. - [Man] What are you gonna do? You can't shoot your way outta here. - [Deneer] Stand back in the hall. - [Man] You're crazy. Where you gonna go? You're gonna get us all killed. - [Man] They don't care, they're Range Guides. - [Man] Back to your cells, move, hurry. - [Kaz Ohsay] Fire. (zapping) (hissing) (mumbling) (coughing) - [Ankar Moor] Here they are. I found them. (breathing heavily) Take him. - [Man] Just him? - [Ankar Moor] Yes, just him, and destroy those two. Take him. The woman goes to Zirpola. You still believe that you are your only master, Kaz Oshay? The taste of slavery may make the difference. - [Lora Zirpola] Let the punishment begin. (melancholy chimey music) (zapping) (screaming) (clanking) (cracking) (grunting) - That's enough. - [Kaz Oshay] Animal. - You call me animal? After all I've tried to do to make you feel at peace. - Fight me. Fight me. Alone. I call the code. You must fight me. - I live by no code. Truly I am my only master. - Fight me, fight me, animal. - No Kaz Oshay. As much as I would enjoy killing you here tonight, I will enjoy watching you die more in the Death Sport tomorrow. Remember your code. Every tear of patience builds the value. Return him to his cell. (thudding) (groaning) - Did Ankar Moor do this to you? - Yes. He would not fight me. I called him to the code, but he refused. - He who has no code is an animal. Are any of your bones broken? - No. Only my flesh. - Trust me. Trust me, our union is real. - Yes. I need you. (melancholy electronic music) - Watch them. You'll see something almost no other Stateman ever has. - You come to me and you need me. I go to you and I join you, for our union is real. I become you now and you become me. And I heal you as I heal myself. (mysterious music) - [Kaz And Deneer] I move with the rhythm of the Earth. Steady, like two paths never wavers. My purpose is clear, of no more importance to the universe than the leaf on a tree. I am still. I share the life. I am one with it. I defend my own. I am as strong as I need to be. I give what I can. No one owes me. I am sacred. No one can touch myself. I am my only master. (whooshing) - [Man] Prisoners, wake up. Stand by the rear wall of your cell. Obey me. (zapping) (screaming) (blasting) Alright, take him away, quickly. - I think he's coming around. Let's hurry, let's move 'em. (clanking) (whooshing) (zapping) (wailing) (groaning) (wailing) (groaning) - I can't stand... - [Man] Hold it, get over. Come on, come on, let's go, get up. Come on, come on, come on, move it, come on. (tense electronic music) - Freeze. Knights. Put this on. - [Kaz Oshay] What's this for? - Death Sport. (pulsing electronic music) (chuckling) (thudding) (laughing) Laugh for me later, after Death Sport. (tense electronic music) - Loyal citizens of Helix, good day. And welcome to Death Sport. (ominous organ music) I have chosen this Death Sport to demonstrate to you a secret weapon that will make our conquest of Tritan inevitable, the Death Machine. We will ride to victory on Death Machine. (tense electronic music) Climax to Death Sport, you will see proof of this. As ordinary Statemen, just like you and me use Death Machines against the awesome power and strength of Range Guides. - What will we do if we're setting into the gods? - We're going to do whatever we have to do to survive. - Loyal citizens, Lord Zirpola presents the Death Machines, one on one. (cheering) (engines roaring) - It requires faster balance, reflex, more coordination than a horse. - And none of the instinct. - The hand and foot controls look easy enough. - Yes. They'd have to be for Statemen. (roaring) (zapping) (cheering) - Well done, you have won your freedom, Stateman. - Excuse me, my lord. (cheering) (mumbling) - I said shut up. None of you are free or ever will be until you have fought like this man has and won. You and you and you four step forward. Come on, let's move it. You six will be fighting the Guards. They'll be a lot tougher than fighting a Stateman. (tense electronic music) - [Man] Guides. - I came to wish you farewell, Kaz Oshay. - Ankar Moor, my only wish is that I could finish the work my mother began on you. - It doesn't matter what you think of me enslaved one. Your death will be your salute to me. - Yours will be mine when you remember the code and fight me. Useless animal. - Salute your mother for me, Kaz. I'll see you both in hell. (tense music) - Son, come back to me, son. - I will. - Loyal citizens, you're about to see the Death Sport make history. Death Machines pitted against Range Guides. Bring on the Guides. - [Man Over Speaker] Start your combat. - High ground. (tense beat music) (roaring) (zooming) (crashing) (cheering) (roaring) (zapping) (crashing) (cheering) (booming) - No. (roaring) (booming) (crashing) (zooming) - Send in more Death Machines. - Go on, go on, get moving, let's go. (roaring) - Dad. - It's no good. Now we must break the force field. - [Marcus] You made it. - [Dr. Karl] Busy out there. - I want those Guides destroyed. Activate the sensor button. (booming) (flames crackling) (cheering) (zapping) (booming) (zooming) - We must take those machines. Coming around. (zooming) (cheering) Are you sure you can handle it, huh? - A lot better than any Stateman. (roaring) (beeping) (booming) (zapping) - [Man] Come on, let's go, keep moving, go, go, go. (roaring) Come on. (booming) - Let's follow Kaz and Deneer. (zooming) - [Lord Zirpola] The explosion has broken the force field. They're escaping. You idiot! You let them escape. You imbecile. - Never, never speak to me like that again, if you value what's left of your miserable life. I'll go after Kaz Oshay and the others because it pleases me and I will see them destroyed because I am Ankar Moor and it pleases me to see them destroyed. (whimpering) (beeping) (whooshing) (flames crackling) (zooming) (zooming) (roaring) - [Ankar Moor Over Radio] Raising Helix City Headquarters. - [Lord Zirpola Over Radio] Come in, Ankar Moor. You have them in range? - [Ankar Moor Over Radio] Not yet. I don't know what they're up to but the-- - What do you mean? It's obvious they're on their way to Tritan. - [Ankar Moor Over Radio] Not directly, they aren't. They're heading for the pass of the flash winds. Kaz Oshay has forgotten I'm a Guide. There'll be a big surprise at the end of that pass. - Call me when you're in position. Bring him back again. (sexy electronic music) (zapping) (wailing) (tense electronic music) (zapping) (somber music) (zooming) - [Man Over Radio] Helix City calling Ankar Moor. - Lord Zipola is dead. (tense music) - [Man] Then it's over. Now we can go back to Helix City. - We will go back to Helix City. We will go back triumphant with the body of Kaz Oshay. The people saw him escape from the Death Sport. But I will show them that no man escapes my justice. - [Man] Why risk our life for that? Let's go back and tell them we killed him. Who's gonna know the difference? - I will. Helix City will have a new lord and protector when I return with the body of Kaz Oshay. - [Man] Come on. (zapping) - Any more suggestions? Good. Now return to your positions. (tense electronic music) (zooming) (dramatic music) (zooming) (zapping) (zooming) (funky electronic music) (zooming) (tense music) (zooming) (funky electronic music) (zapping) (tense music) (zooming) (crashing) (booming) (flames crackling) Let's go. (zooming) You can trick an enforcer but you cannot escape your destiny. Death at the hands of Ankar Moor. - Where was the child lost? - By the sand cliffs, where my group was attacked. - We have union. - We travel with you as far as the sand cliffs. Will you guide us that far? - Yes, we will guide you all the way to Tritan, after we have found the child. (roaring) (zooming) (splashing) (zooming) It seems clear. - Yes, it's strange. I've never heard of this place before. - Nor have I. - Dad, what do Guides mean when they tell each other that our union is limited? - Guides are fiercely independent. They don't believe in forming permanent relationships. Our union is limited means let's get together to do something now, but when we're finished, each is on his own again. - We could go on. - No. On a night such as this, the mutants will be out. We need a defendable space. (tense music) (squeaking) We can use this. (zapping) (whooshing) Just testing my aim. (funky electronic music) Stay close. - What do you think this place used to be? - Must be a secret munitions factory, like Helix or Tritan. One that was left in the wake of the war. - I wonder what happened to everything. (tense music) (rats squeaking) - [Kaz Oshay] Trying to get yourself killed? - [Marcus] Sorry, I just wanted a look. - Then look. (tense music) - My God, the mutants did that? (laughing) (rats squeaking) - Damn, if we could just find them. Flush them out, then run 'em down fast across the plains. I'd even risk the mutants. It wouldn't be half as bad as that foul fiend, that fiery spirit of a mother that bred him to torment me. - We must be grateful for every moment, for we must remember these moments will never come back to us. (melancholy music) I want you, Kaz. I want you. (funky beat music) - Just as I thought. They're heading in straight toward the pass. Do not move until I tell you to. - We have to reach the sand cliffs before midday. - Yes, the flash wind's coming and if you hadn't overslept this morning, we'd stand a better chance. (chuckling) - Nobody's perfect. - You two, block the pass. The others come with me. I'll finish him off. (zooming) - Alright come on. Can't live forever. - They're trying to surround us. - Good, then let's attack. (funky beat music) (zooming) (zapping) - Let's go get 'em. (zooming) - Hold it. (zooming) (funky beat music) Alright, get 'em! (zooming) (zapping) (zapping) - [Marcus] Dad! (roaring) - It's all your fault! I told you to hold the lines! Why didn't you obey me? (zooming) - Marcus, get back up there. - They killed him. - Marcus, your father died bravely. You can't kill 'em all by yourself. Stick with us. Let's go. Come on, Marcus. (zooming) (roaring) (zooming) They're gaining on us. - We could stand and fight them here. - Not with the flash wind coming. (zooming) (roaring) (wind whooshing) - Flash wind, we must find shelter. The sand cliffs, that's all that's nearby. - Yes, and that's where they are headed. (zooming) (tense melancholy music) - What is she doing? - She's looking. - Looking for what? If we don't find shelter soon, the wind will be here, or Ankar Moor will. Well, what is she looking for? - The past. - Mutants. The mutants, the mutants have her. - [Kaz Oshay] Then there must be caves around here. - [Deneer] Yes, and we must find her. There's a chance she's still alive. - Hey wait a minute. You're going in the mutant caves? Are you crazy? You'll never come out of there alive. - Stateman, whether you come or stay behind means nothing to me, but I take care of my own. (funky electronic music) (beeping) - They cannot go anywhere, either. They will be there when the wind has passed. (wind whooshing) (tense electronic music) (water dripping) (tense electronic music) - Do not use your blaster until we are on our way out. The noise could bring a swarm of them about us. - Don't they sleep at day? - Some of them. (tense music) (growling) - We will follow them. (grunting) - Be cautious, Kaz. It carries a poison I cannot heal. - Where is the one of ours? The one you stole? The little one. Where? (growling) You lead me astray, and I'll carve you before I kill you. Now show me. - That means she's still alive. (tense music) - Where is she? (growling) How much further, huh? She's in the sleeping chamber on the far side. - Marcus, hide here in the shadows. - What happens to me if you don't come back? - You have a hand blaster, use it. (tense music) Tara, Tara. Shh. (squeaking) Don't make a sound. - [Tara] I love you. - I love you, too. We take care of our own. Now we have a very, very long way to go and I want you to stay very, very close. - Quickly, before they wake up. (tense music) (growling) Run! - [Deneer] Ah! - [Tara] Let's get out of here, they're coming! (thudding) (growling) - [Marcus] Run, Kaz! (zapping) (frenzied electronic music) - [Tara] Let's get out of here, they're coming! (yelling) (thudding) Watch out Deneer, they've got torches! - Run, Tara, run! (frenzied electronic music) (growling) (thudding) (grunting) (flames crackling) (wailing) - [Marcus] Kaz! Kaz, where are you? Help Kaz! Help me! Help me! (mumbling) Help me Kaz. - [Kaz] Kick him away. - [Marcus] I can't. I can't, they're strong. (grunting) - [Kaz] Taste my blade. (mumbling) - [Marcus] Kaz, thank you. Thank you. (wind whooshing) - [Kaz] Hold tight. - [Marcus] My leg is numb. I don't think I can ride. - Here, ride with me. There'll be medicine for the poison in Tritan. - [Kaz] You go on, Deneer. I'll lead them away. - Be powerful, Kaz. I'll be waiting for you in Tritan if you show. If not, I will meet you on the other side. Our union is strong. - I will see you in Tritan, Deneer. (zooming) (funky beat music) - Tritan is not far from us, now. We can make it. - [Ankar Moor Over Radio] He's heading right for the fuel base. Now we've got him. (zooming) (whooshing) (zooming) (roaring) (whooshing) (crashing) (booming) (mumbling) (zooming) (crashing) (booming) (zooming) (booming) (zooming) (booming) (dramatic music) - Marcus, look. - We made it? - Yes. Just as I said we would. (zooming) (electronic beeping) - The truth needs no introduction. When the sun rises, there's no necessity to announce it. Clearly we have lost. You can go back to Helix. There's nothing to be gained by coming with me. (melancholy music) Man is like a candle. He must radiate life by burning himself. I have a destiny to meet. - Be powerful, Ankar Moor. (dramatic music) (zooming) (tense dramatic music) - Now we will have our duel. - I agree. - With or without your Death Machines. - Without. - With whistlers. - Yes. Like the day I met Oshay. (electronic beeping music) - Be powerful, Marcus. Stay well. - Deneer, I don't know how to thank you, or Kaz. - Yes, we all owe you a tremendous debt. - Sir, a duel sir, out on the range. You can see it from the tower. - [Deneer] Quickly, Tara. (tense dramatic music) (clanging) (grunting) - Hiya! (clanging) - Hut, ha! (tense music) (clanging) (grunting) (chuckling) (clanging) Ha, heh. (grunting) - [Ankar Moor] Ah! - Ah! (grunting) (tense music) - You're not as good as your mother. - But far better than you. (growling) (thudding) (dramatic music) - [Deneer] They thanked us and gave us two horses. - Great, (mumbling) have a horse. You're a machine. Where will you go now? - With you. - [Kaz Oshay] With me? - Yes. You don't want me? - Yes, I do. - Then our union is complete. - I agree. (horses whinnying) (dramatic music) (funky uptempo music) (whooshing) (electronic beeping)
