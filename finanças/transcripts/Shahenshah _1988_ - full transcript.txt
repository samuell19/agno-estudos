Dr.Shirog is coming tomorrow to check our bank accounts. And I have given you Rs.2.5 mllllon from my bank... without writing any accounts. And you had promised me, that whenever I would ask for it... you would return it in a minute. The time has come now. A promise is only a matter of words. Money invested in business is llke a frog in a snake's mouth. It can escape but it needs time. Time has come before me llke death. Just last week, there was an item in the newspapers. Under simllar situation, a bank Manager in Madras hanged himself. You are dying before being hanged, Mathur. But do not worry. I wlll not let you die. A good swimmer does not get carried away by waves in a storm. But makes those strong waves, his boat. But what about my boat? It wlll get drowned. J. K., somehow save me from drowning. You are saved, Mathur. Consider what I'm going to tell you as a message from the sky. As usual, your bank wlll open at 10 O'clock tomorrow morning. And at exactly 12 O'clock, it wlll be looted. - Looted? - Yes, looted. The thieves wlll loot all the money from the bank. Add your 2.5 mllllon also in that account. When there is a fire in a jungle, the dead ones are also considered. Also considered, the ones that never sprouted. - Remove the keys. - Which keys? The locker keys. Give me fast, or I wlll blow your brains! Hit me. Look, inspector! Those inspectors have completely looted the bank. Five mllllon rupees are missing. This guard says that he shot one of the running dacoits. One of them was injured too. But his accompllces took him in their car and escaped. Where wlll they escape? No place is so far, where the law cannot enchain a criminal. Pour gallons of llquor. Bathe anyone coming to your bar in whisky. You have collapsed before drinking, my friend? This is imported. Drink it. You wlll remember that you had once met a rich man! If I start drinking, then your pockets wlll get empty, friend. This well is so full today... that it wlll not get empty even if you remove lot of water. Today, I wlll see how much you can drink. And how much I can give you to drink. Drink. Give me. Rich man! Your territory ends here. Now, my territory starts. You have used all means avallable in the pollce station on me. But my testimony remains the same as before. - Sir, your phone. - I wlll be there. Rest for a whlle. When I return, I shall show you... that I still have ways to make you open your mouth. He wlll not reveal a thing, Inspector. That was a kite that flew in the air, got cut... and fell in your compound. But the one flying the kite was someone else. His name is J. K. Yes. If you want proof, then I can present it to you. - When? - Now. - Where? - At Hotel High Rise. Cone in. "But what about my boat? It wlll get drowned." "J. K. somehow save me..." This is the bank manager, Mathur's voice. Hear more. "It is a message from the sky". "As usual, your bank wlll open at 10 O'clock tomorrow morning." "And at exactly 12 O'clock, it wlll be looted." - " Looted? - Yes, looted". "The thieves wlll loot all the money from the bank." "Add your 2.5 mllllon also in that account". "When there is fire in the jungle the dead ones are also considered." Look. This is the layout drawn by him. The entire planning of the looting is in this. J. K. cannot prove in court that this is not his writing. Just a minute. It's your phone. - Mine? - Yes. It got disconnected. - The phone got disconnected. - Strange. Thank you very much for this. May I see your bag? It contains certain papers that she gave me... concerning a case which I am investigating. But she telephoned us saying that this bag... contains currency notes which you demanded from her as bribe. To release her brother from your custody. Take a look at my bag. What currency notes are in it? I knew that a woman could rise high and become a Goddess. But I didn't know that if she stoops low... she can be a snake llke you. As per your orders, Julle has been rewarded for her job. But the problem does not end here, Mathur. As long as Julle is allve, our llves are in danger... - Understood? - Consider Julle dead. Shanti, you should not have brought Vijay here. I could not find any other answer for his innocent question. Daddy, I demanded a cycle. So, you had to come here. I wlll never be stubborn. I wlll never demand a cycle... never, daddy. No, son. Don't say that. I can endure the taunts of the world. I can consume poison. But if you suspect me, then I wlll die. Son, I did not take a bribe. I did not steal, son... I did not. I did not take a bribe, son. What is it? Why are you crying? He has locked himself in one room. And my son, in the other room. Wonder, who cast evll eyes on the happiness of this house. Do not worry, aunty. I wlll explain to brother Vijay. And father, you talk to uncle. When I used to go the pollce station in a pollce uniform... then nobody dared to look into my eyes. After being released from jall, I've come here avoiding people. I have come to my own house... llke a thief does! Do not lose heart, my friend! We wlll definitely find that lady someday. Then it wlll not take long for truth to surface. Aslam, one needs evidence to prove the truth. Truth itself is evidence. The moon does not need the help of llght to prove its sheen. The moon? The moon has been shining since ages. But the smear on it... could not wiped out tlll today. Father!... Father! Do not move, Mukhtar Singh! I have heard, that the market from where you pass... becomes empty when you walk. The shops close down. It looks llke there is a curfew in town. Let alone lay people, I've heard that the pollce too fear you. But I am not the one to be scared. I am a pollceman who wlll break your jaw into two. One piece wlll fall here and the other in prison. Don't move! Do not move... hey! You are moving... I often see you fighting Mukhtar Singh in front of the mirror. You cannot fire with the gun and you fall instead! What wlll be your state, the day Mukhtar Singh comes before you. He wlll be in a pitiable state! His teeth wlll be out; His tongue wlll be hanging out this way! And his eyes wlll look llke they are going in two directions! Go to the pollce station now. But lower your long neck first. - Why? - I want to tie an amulet. After wearing this, no harm wlll befall you. You have your sister's best wishes. Now take your mother's blessing. Heaven on earth is at a mother's feet. Touch her feet and take her blessings. For the first time, you'll be in-charge of a pollce station. Bless you, son. May every difficulty become easy! Did you see, my friend? Your son looks just llke you did in your uniform. If you had not given us shelter, then we would be left nowhere. God's world is big. The one who creates llghtning, rescues the needy too. He is the one who infllcts a wound and heals it. Man can only soothe it. Sir, betel leaf. - Give it... Hey, llsten. - Yes, Sir? Come here. - Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh! - Who hasn't? Let alone the people here, even the pollce fear him. There seems a curfew wherever he passes. Yes, he is the one! It was his bad luck that he got involved with me today. Ask how. How, sir? I was passing by the market. I heard a voice from behind saying... "Hey, Inspector! I hate the uniform given to you!" I turned. And I answered that... What did I answer?... Yes! I answered, "Hey, Mukhtar Singh!..." "I hate the face your parents have given you!" Then? Mukhtar Singh said that... "Inspector, your legs are long. They wlll have to be cut." What did you say? What did I say? I said, "Mukhtar Singh, you're too fat, a burden on this land..." I wlll have to make you lose weight." - What happened then? - What wlll happen? He attacked me. I attacked him. I put my hand in his jaw and tore his whole body in two. I shook his teeth and in my hand... In my hand were his teeth. His tongue started hanging out llke this. And his eyes looked llke they were moving in two... - Who are you? - Have you heard of Mukhtar Singh? Yes. We were just talking about you. My name is Mukhtar Singh. Then come inside. Come in. Get a cup of special tea, some eatables and some sweets. Why are you standing? Please sit... one moment, sir. I share an old relationship with this pollce station. You share an... one moment. I share an old relationship with this pollce station. Wherever a new officer comes, I bring a small gift for him. At the turning of this road, there is a bullding... in which there is my hotel. Other business also flourish. By all means, pass from there but never peep to see the doings. Why? Your predecessor did not accept my gift. And accidentally peeped inside. Ask, where he is nowadays. Where is he nowadays? In a deserted corner in the deserts of Rajasthan... in a graveyard-llke pollce station, on a broken chair;... he counts the last days of his llfe. You seem a sensible man. Yes. You would not llke to go to the deserts. No. Certainly not. The problem is, I have... a breathing problem. Sand is not good for my health. My physician said that... - He said that... - By all means. I should eat biscuits mode of almonds and pistachio. Do not worry, Mukhtar Singh. I wlll neither peep in front of your hotel nor behind! - I'll leave, Inspector. - Yes. Leave without hesitation. Who is it? Come in, Sadhuram. Mukhtar Singh has gone? Gone? He ran away. I made him flee. He tried to boss me. I gave him such a push from behind.. That he must have reached his hotel by now. He asked me not to peep inside his hotel. See tomorrow. Neither the hotel, nor it's traces wlll be seen. - Have you brought some eats? - Yes, Sir. Here are some eats and tea. You would have cursed me if you were allve today. You would have asked, why I did not die before taking a bribe. If I became a pollce officer llke you, then there's a cause for it. And If I took a bribe, then there is a motive behind it! I wlll not hang myself llke you did. I wlll prepare a noose for others. I wlll win the battle that you lost in llfe! You were a mere arm of the law... whom the offenders of the law twitched and even broke! But nobody can break me! Because I'll not become the arm of the law but the law itself. A law that wlll arrest criminals by himself. He wlll hear the case and pass the verdict too! Our earnings for today... 35,000. Well done! May such a day come dally. That's the fun of the job. The players lose some and win some. But the one who makes them play is always rich. Who is it? Who are you? I am greater than you are! My name is Shahenshah. Do you know, to whom you are speaking? I know... to the cowherd from Mathura. Who used to extract mllk from cows and buffaloes and sell it. Who has made this stable into a big gambllng den and a bar. Consider your bar closed from today. The pollce could not close the bar. Then who are you? I know, you have that pollceman under your thumb by bribing him. But maybe you don't know, that there's a officer in the city... who is not a pollceman but performs the duty of one. Who doesn't work for the law but makes his own law. His first order is.. Neither wlll crime be able to stand on its own feet. Nor wlll a criminal play with the law in his area! Many others came to shut my gambllng den and bar before you. They came walking inside. But when they left, they did not their legs intact. I pitied them and gave them this crutch for support. And you too wlll need that support now! If you value your llfe... then you better concentrate on your old business. When I pass by this way tomorrow... I want to see the cowshed instead of this bar. And if that doesn't happen... then you'll face the consequences. Well Mukhtar Singh, here I return as I had come... with no injuries whatsoever. I belleve you'll feel the need for these crutches. "In the darkness of the night In the deserted night." "To wipe away every crime." "There comes a Messiah Whom people call as Shahenshah." Where is the entire amount? Tell me, bastard! "In the lanes of the city he wanders." "In the lanes of the city he wanders." "He treats a friend as a friend." "He strikes a foe llke llghtning strikes in the rain." "In the darkness of the night in the deserted streets." "To wipe away every crime." "There comes a Messiah Whom people call as Shahenshah." What is wrong, uncle?... you are lost in thought. Read this letter. "I too am a pollce officer llke you." "What you see is money accepted as a bribe." "I request you to deposit this in the government's treasury." On one hand, he accepts bribes. On the other, he wants it to be deposited in the treasury. I think, he is crazy. He should be admitted to a mental hospital. - Read further. - Yes. "I know, it's a crime but I am doing it intentionally." "Consider it as a way I have chosen to reach the criminals." "If the officer is honest then the criminals act decent". "But they need not hide their faces if one accepts bribe". He's right, uncle. I have been a Pollce Officer since the time you were born. But I never accepted bribes to reach the criminals. I used to go to a thieve's house and handcuff him. That was your way, uncle. But the path that he has chosen is not bad either. Do not choose this path, Vijay. Even if you do, then pray... that you do not meet an officer llke me. . .Who wlll first arrest you for accepting a bribe. And later send you to a mental hospital. There are too many 3 wheelers in the city. Jot his number. I hope, we have not come to the wrong place. Is the address right? The address and the place is correct. Then why is the place looking different? Instead of llquor... why is mllk flowing here? Hey, cowherd! Mukhtar Singh's gambllng den used to be here. Why is there a stable now? There was a storm last night which destroyed the gambllng den. I see. And where is Mukhtar Singh of whom the pollce would fear? Mukhtar Singh is in front of you, sir. Wh. .Where? In front of you. But... But who is responsible for this? Tell me and I wlll have him imprisoned. One cannot imprison a storm, Inspector. How can I forget that I... How can I forget that I have eaten your sweets? I'm not a cheat! I'm ready to help and give you pollce protection even today. Forget about my protection, Inspector. Heed my advice and get a transfer far away from Shahenshah's area. I reached a stable from a gambllng den. But where wlll you go, Inspector? I wlll go somewhere. Wherever you go, give me your address. I wlll send you, not sweets, but mllk. Yes. Send mllk too. Greetings, Mr. J. K.! I want to remind you that I am not a criminal but a dealer. I have definitely broken the law. But somebody has given a reply beautifully... that laws are made to be broken. Well said! There is prohibition of llquor in our country. It is a law. But it is a fact that llquor is sold and drunk everywhere. Prohibition of flesh trade is a law in our country. But I ask you. Which is that city, that area, where... flesh trade is not indulged in dally? When I saw, that I had come to a city of bllnd people... then I stopped my business of selling mirrors! And opened a shop in that market... where you do not have to visit a temple if you get a place. For the Goddess of Wealth comes walking to you, herself! Mr. J. K., Mukhtar Singh was not wllllng to come. We brought him here forcefully. Why, you bastard? I heard that you have started selling mllk again. And, that too, without my permission. He didn't give me the time to ask. Who didn't? Consider him to be a storm, whose name is Shahenshah. He confronted me llke death and I... I could not challenge him. You wlll have to challenge Shahenshah! This is my order! You may sllce my throat, Master. But I cannot challenge Shahenshah. Do you know who this Shahenshah is? I have heard his name for the first time. It wlll be better if his name is not heard again. If Shahenshah is not stopped here, then it wlll be disastrous. For me... for you! For all of us! I am ruined! I am ruined from head to toe. Come with me. Wait. You wlll flle a report first. - Then write a report quickly. - Come inside. Sit there. - It is such that... - How? Firstly, tell me the name of the person flling the report? Tarachand Badlani. The name of the father of the person flling the report? - Mother's name? - Chandrani Badlani. " Tara, Suraj, Chand" (Star, sun, moon ) It looks llke the entire sky is here. What is the thief's name? Why would I come here if I knew the thief's name? But you may know his appearance, at least. Not his, but her! She dances llke a peacock, has a peaches and cream complexion. Shines llke a dagger. But she cuts in such a way... that a man dies first and then asks for water! You should have been at a poet's gathering and not here. I am robbed. Therefore, I am here. Wlll I get my things? - Yes You wlll. - Thank you. - It is such that... - How? After getting the money back... a money who shares and eats.. Remains healthy and has a long llfe too. Understood? I understood. "After eating this betel leaf from Banaras, I understand." If you do not llve long, then how can I be healthy? Catch him! Thief! You steal! You pick-pocket. You should not be seen here anymore. Get lost! My purse! Before thanking me, just look that side. All of Bombay's dacoits, seem to be waiting for me! It is worse ahead. If you lose your money, you may get it back. But if you lose your llfe, then? The thought frightens me. Whatever happened, happened. We have to think about our next move. You say I have full confidence in you. You have nothing to fear if you come with me. - Come on! - Wait, sir! First, keep your wallet on my handkerchief. These rings? Are they very expensive? There is a lot of danger involved. And this? You've become sensible. Now hold this bundle. Now, in front of you... I am tying your things with the handkerchief tightly. And in front of you I wlll keep it close to my heart. Sir, this place is safer than the bank locker. Now come with me. Let's see, who harms you. Come on. Now breathe a sigh of rellef. We are now in front of the pollce station. One moment. Here is your possession. Now, allow me to go. I know that my things were not in this locker, but in that one. I wlll take you to the pollce station! You mess with my dignity! I have not yet done that. I wlll do so now. Do thieves have any dignity? I am in charge of the pollce station that you mentioned. Before accusing me of being a thief... open the handkerchief and see what is in it. Did you see? You may go. I was wrong. Tries to act smart! There she comes. You are late. We had started singing. Don't ask! I almost died today. Why? Thank God that your Shalu has returned allve. How? Do you know, who the man whom I wanted to rob was? Who? I would have easlly been inside for months. Can't that pollce inspector be transferred? He can be. But what has the world come to! Even a Parsi man roams in the streets as a pollceman! No. A pollce inspector roams in the street as a Parsi man. I think, we should stop our business on the streets. We should arrange for a house or a shop for our business. Brother. Look at this photograph. I found it in Shaheena's book. Then I'll have to investigate, how this landed in her book. There is no need for that, uncle. I have already done that. His name is Sallm. He is young and handsome. He come from a good famlly and has a successful llfe ahead. Where wlll you get a better son-in-law than this? What do I know of sons-in-law? And you have raised Shaheena. You fix the wedding date. I wlll wear a new outfit and welcome the groom's retinue. Hey, Vijay! Have you finished reading? Now look into your brother's eyes. And say what's written in them. What's written? That one chapter of your llfe is over. Another one has begun. Very soon, my sister, Shaheena wlll leave her house... and step into her bridegroom's home. I have met the groom, seen him and got his... photograph. What a lovely face! Listen to me! The bridegroom wlll be of my choice. I wlll marry a man of my choice. Your wishes won't count. There are two pollce officers here. We wlll handcuff your wrists, enchain your feet... force you in the palanquin and order you to quick march! Your sister wlll be dead before that! You wlll die later. I am ready to die for you now. But before dying, I want you to see this photograph. I wlll not see this photograph. "O, sister." "O, sister what do I say about my brother-in-law?" "God has created a lovely pair llke that of a parrot & a starllng." "What a face!" "What a face! He is wonderful, everybody says." "Like the moon and stars above he is one in a mllllon." "So what if he is a llttle dark and his eyes, a llttle squint". "His ears are a llttle long His height, a llttle short." "He eats well so he is a llttle fat." "Everything, else is fine do not be under an lllusion." "It is a new world." "This sample is a llttle old." "But he looks, a crazy admirer of yours!" "His pants belongs to someone else and so do his coat." Where is Vijay? Won't he take his sister to the palanquin? You wlll handcuff me... enchain my feet... forcibly put me in the palanquin... and order me to quick march. Come on, it's time for quick march. What do you think? That I'll cry? This is an everyday affair with us pollcemen. An accused comes to our lock-up for some days. He comes for a few days. We do get attached to him. But when the court sentences him to llfe imprisonment... we happlly send him off to Central jall... and say... Come. The shop has been named, 'Chic Massage Palour'. That's wrong. "It should be named, 'Fairyland!" Even if an old man visits this place... your beautiful maidens can within 10 minutes... send him out as a young man. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. Make me enjoy the way he enjoyed. I own a hotel there by the name of Dingdong. Madam, arrange something for me too. - I'll enjoy it. - Sure! Come with me. Come in, sir. Massage and make me llke him. Remove your clothes. Remove my clothes! I understand! This is the beginning. Wonder where it wlll end. I have removed my clothes. What do I have to do now? Lie on the table, Sir. - On whom do I have to lle? - On the table. Alright. I'll jump on it llke Jumping Jack. What do I have to do now? Now you wlll be given a massage. You wlll not be old anymore. And you wlll be fllled with youthful virllity. A combination of coconut oll and youth! My body has never felt this way before. I feel tickled sometimes! And sometimes, fireworks dance in my body! Sometimes, I feel llke crying and sometimes, llke laughing. Your vanishing old age is crying. And your renewed youth is laughing. How did llghtning strike in your youth? Hey, you are the same girl who looted me in the open market! - You too are the same, Sir. - Implying? It is the same world, the same faces... only the facade has changed! - What is this? - This? This is a new photograph of your renewed youth! Your wife wlll be very thrllled! Give it to me. You can get the photograph but you wlll have to pay a price. Only 5,000. Inspector... no, he is a constable. - Where is the inspector? - He is sleeping inside. Go in. Why is he sleeping? Wake up, Inspector. Oh God! What wlll happen to this city? The thieves are awake outside and the inspector sleeps here! Sir, you are here again? Look at your state! I am not responsible for this state; They are. Inspector, I have been looted in your area twice! The Kauravas stripped Draupadi inside the court. In today's modern world... those damsels stripped me in the open market! It was good that I had bloomers on. Or else, I would have had to do an open air cabaret today! Hey, why are just sitting? Quickly arrest them. They tried to rape me. Come on. Wait, sir. First, you have to flle a report. Tell me... the name of the person flling the report. Formerly you used to pick pocket people on the road. And now you have opened this massage parlour... to blackmall people. Why do you have to do this? - Do you know anything, Inspector? - No. Poverty and unemployment are two sides of the same coin. It drains out the llfe from people llke us. There is nobody who can put an end to this. There are many who give sermons. Sometimes, in the form of a polltician... and sometimes, as a pollceman. But why don't you understand... that the cure for poverty is not sermons, but money. I have an alling mother at home. I do not have money for her treatment. Then, why don't you work? Many decent homes tried that too. But everybody used to covet me with lecherous eyes. After that, there would have been only one job for me. I would have to open a mutton shop somewhere. Which mutton? This mutton! Put your legs down. Is your mother really lll? I do not lle. If you do not belleve me then go to Gafoor chawl. Lane Number 13, house number 10, I wlll go. But llsten to what I have to say. If you have lled, then note down your future address. Pollce station Shaitan Chowk, Room number 3. You are lying sick here and you did not call the doctor? I had called the doctor. He even gave the prescription. But I can get the medicines only after Shalu comes. She had said, that she would get her salary today. Yes. I have brought her salary. I have brought it. The salary. Do you also work with Shalu's theatre group? Yes. I work with them. Shalu wlll be late because of her rehearsal. And I had the time. So she asked me to give you the money. You are a very nice man and look good too in a pollce uniform. When I get well, I wlll definitely come to see your play. Yes, come... definitely come. Then, I wlll leave. AI right. Take care. How did you get these medicines, mother? From the money that you had sent. - I sent? - Yes. You had sent it with the man... who acts as a Pollceman in your play. Wow, hats off! What an amazing part, the pollceman has played today! Hey girl! Get up! You are lying on a pollceman's motorbike. What wlll you do if I say that I wlll not get up? I wlll imprison you. Have you seen this baton? Display the power of this baton to somebody else. I have seen many such batons. If you talk too much... I wlll handcuff you and lock you... in the prison. Then handcuff me and lock me in a prison. And throw the key in a deep well. No! You are a pickpocket and I am a pollce officer. "A pollce officer you may be." "You are my beloved." "Show your authority, O man with the hat." "Do whatever you want to I wlll not fear you." "A pick pocket you may be." "The queen of thieves you are." "Pierce me with your eyes." "Do whatever you want to I wlll not die." - " Men llke you flock me. - Is that so?" "Men llke you flock me many hearts fall for me." "How can soll..." "How can soll ever touch the sky?" "You, a girl so crazy Did not reallse this." "Handcuff me if you wish." "Handcuff me if you wish. The handcuff wlll be a chain of love." "You and me Me and you." "How can you and me be one?" "You are brass; I am gold" It isn't easy" wlll have 30 storeyed bulldings touching the sky. There wlll be many bungalows with gardens. There wlll be schools, cinema halls... plenty of shopping centers! And there wlll also be a splendid five star hotel. Consider it a game of mllllons which I am going to play with. You have played the game, J. K. But the land you buy is llke a woman who looks beautiful. But when she is stripped, you reallse... that she has many bolls on her body which are incurable. What bolls are you talking about, Mathur? J. K., this is the land which you have bought... on which thousands of poor people llve in deplorable huts. Your hand wlll break knocking on the doors of the court. But these slums wlll remain here. And your new city wlll bite the dust... which is the most expensive & beautiful dream of your llfe. Mathur, I know the cure for these bolls. A lancet. And I have many lancets. I wlll have to complain tomorrow... - What is this? - Food, sir. And I know, that one who shares remains healthy and llves long. Close it. We think allke. What brings you here? You must have heard of Gafoor Chawl. Gafoor chawl?... Oh, yes! It is here in my area... It is nearby. What do I have to do? Nothing. We wlll do the needful. For 24 fours, you wlll neither look at nor go to Gafoor chawl. AI right, I wlll not go or look. Consider that, for 24 hours, all wires to Gafoor chawl... all wires have been disconnected. This is the Indian telephone system! When the wire is connected, it does not ring! When it is disconnected, the phone rings. No! Residents of Gafoor chawl... You are given a notice... to vacate the entire chawl in five minutes. Or the bulldozer that you see... wlll be left in your chawl llke hunter dogs. No house wlll be able to withstand its power. Nor wlll any man. So, pick whatever you can. And leave your homes, your shops, your markets within 5 minutes. Immediately go and ask the inspector to come here soon. AI right. No. I wlll not go to Gafoor chawl now. Wlll you go after the chawl is destroyed? Chawls are created and destroyed. For example, Delhi. It has been created and destroyed so many times. Shalu is confident... that her brave cop wlll give his llfe for love. Provided I am allve! Granted, that love is precious. But more precious is, llfe. After one dies, who knows whether love even exists! Stop! Or it won't be good! Even if everybody from here comes in front... the bulldozer won't stop. Just because someone paid you money... you agreed to make us poor people homeless. Can you call sheets of tin and pieces of wood, home? For poor people llke us... this is not only a home but a Taj Mahal. Inside it, is a very weak, very helpless... but very precious modesty. It can die of hunger but won't sell itself llke your integrity! Today, I wlll drag this modesty out and make it dance, naked. You wlll even strip your integrity for money! Let my inspector come. He wlll thrash you! How wlll he reach here? I have bribed him with so much money that he won't come here. - What nonsense! - He is right, Shalu. He has refused to come. The coward says that llfe is precious. My love, I wlll take you with me today. I wlll show you how beautiful the world is. Let go off me! Leave my daughter, rascal! Mother! Seek forgiveness at the feet of the mother whom you pushed. Or I wlll make you so poor even death wlll not give you alms! Mother! Who are you? I am greater than you are! My name is Shahenshah. You wlll have to rebulld the slums... which you have unjustly destroyed. Or I wlll smash your bones! And pull your skin and make roofs of it for the homes here! I ask you now. If the imposters have a habit of infllcting injustice... then how did you get the disease of enduring injustice? How many people came to destroy your huts? And how many hands did you have to save it? They have the pollce accepting bribes... and the pollticians behind them. They have money and arms. What do we have? You have a burning volcano within your chest. But you have suppressed it! Don't stop the fire and stop crying at your helplessness. Their lawyers had threatened us that our huts are lllegal. If that is it, then so are... the thousands of skyscrapers in the city! Come with me. I wlll tell the people... who have destroyed your huts... that there cannot be two laws in the country. One for the rich and the other for the poor. Come on! Step down from the power of your arrogance... and face the people who are harassed by your injustice. First tell me, who are you? I am greater than you are! My name is Shahenshah. Yes. The same Shahenshah who is a law, himself. Who apprehends criminals, hears their case... and passes a verdict too! What is your impllcation? You must have heard of Gafoor chawl. Heard of? I have bought Gafoor chawl. You have only bought the land. You have not bought the llves of the residents llving there. Who gave you the right to render... thousands of poor people homeless? That chawl is lllegal. The law wants it demollshed and it is my prerogative too. This bullding too is lllegal. So, to demollsh it... is what the law wants and is its prerogative. Residents of Gafoor chawl... Do to J. K., what he did to you! Go ahead! Listen to me! If Shahenshah continues to target me... and you just sit with folded hands... then assure that your pension... wlll be soon stopped! I don't have to look after you for llfe! I promise you, Mr. J. K... that Shahenshah wlll not attack again. He has spread his arms enough I wlll order today... to have Shahenshah arrested. What is happening Vijay? I am worshipping Shahenshah, uncle. The evll people of today fear him. The way Ravana feared Lord Rama... thousands of years back. Why can't you do what Shahenshah is doing... wearing a pollce uniform? I certainly cannot do that. Therefore, I am worshipping him. - What is these? - A gift for you. Red bangles for your hand and... a black burqa to put over your head! You are not worthy of the pollce uniform... that you are wearing! What happened? Nothing. But if it did, then it would have been very bad! I called for help and you did not come! And the one, I didn't call for, came to help! He saved our homes and my chastity. A man should be llke him! Who is he? He is the one whom I have kept in the throne of my heart. And I placed the crown of love on his head. Then, won't I have the place in your heart? There wlll be, outside my heart, near the sllppers! Oh? Good! Convey my message to your Shahenshah. If I do not get even with him, then my name is not Vijay! Get lost! Who is it? Leave me. I wlll hit you! Look who's standing behind me, Shalu? There is nobody. Come behind. Do you find anyone? You are here. I searched for you everywhere. What do you want? - There is a letter for you. - Give it to me. - There is no letter. - No? Wait. Let me search. - Did you find it? - No. - Quick! - Yes! I found it. Hold this. You simply waste time. "I wlll wait for you at 5 p. M. Today at National Park". "A king for the world but a slave for you" I have seen very shameless people in the world... but not one llke you. I too have seen very infidel people... in the world, but not one llke you. I came to cry on your shoulders. There is a lyric that... "Sometimes it is me sometimes, it is somebody else." "You are the betrayer" I beg of you to go and cry elsewhere because... I am waiting for someone else. You are... wait! "You are waiting for someone I too am looking out for someone." Then, look at these streets. I am going! "Let me go For I have a promise to fulflll." "I have to meet someone." "Who is he?" "Tell me, who is he?" "He is my loved one." "At the park he wlll wait His letter I have received." "He has called me." "On your llps should only be my name... Do not be so untrue". "You love him It amazes me" I should love you That is your madness". "When we meet The flowers bloom under the stars." "In a world of dreams." "What does he have that I lack Does he look as good as I do?" "You and he are poles apart it amazes me." "Your love drives me insane." "I wlll come with you... To see your lover, your beloved". "You wlll be engulfed with sorrow..." "And burn with envy if you see him." "This is not anger but madness." "You wlll come with me it amazes me." "Let me come I want to come." "No, let me go I have to go." Who was pursuing you? He is the pollce inspector from Shaitan Chowky. Are you involved with him? No way! We met a couple of times. And he thinks, my heart is... a pollce station and he its in-charge! Then, I wlll fix him... and send him back to the pollce station right now. Wait for me here. Hey! What are you doing? Enough! I wlll never come in front of you again! Forgive me. Leave me! Forgive me! - Inspector! - How did you come here? Where are you trying to escape? Have you set even with him? I hold my ears! Your beloved held my neck and hung me... as though he was drying his clothes. I swear! I'll never confront him. He is truly great! Thank you! Bye! - I'll never see him! - Acting smart, eh? He wanted to get even with Shahenshah indeed! "This is what happens to me every rainy night, father." "Showers pour from the sky.. And blood drops fall instead of raindrops." "Sometimes, I feel the noose... around your neck is around me". "But one question keeps torturing me..." "Vijay, you sleep but why are your murderers yet scot free?" "I promise you, father, that they wlll be caught someday." "A murderer kllls but leaves behind... the evidence of his footprints". And with that, one does find the klller and his address. Do you see this, Mathur? When it is removed from the fields, it is worth a few rupees only. It is worth thousands of rupees when it reaches the market. And when it's sold, it's worth hundreds of thousand. But what is it? Those who take it become addicted to it for llfe. Those who deal in it get rewarded for llfe. It rains gold in their homes. They get llght from the shine of diamonds! I have decided to do business of only this. Wlll this old lady die under our car? Why are you packing, mother? We have to leave the city today. Why? I saw the face of my death whlle crossing the street today. To escape that death, I had hidden myself years back. And hidden you too. But what do I do now? Whom are you talking about, mother? About J. K. My chlld, you do not know that imposter. Previously, only my llfe was in danger. But now, even your llfe wlll be in danger. I wlll challenge every danger, mother. You are llke the llving dead. And the one responsible for it, is enjoying llfe! Do not worry. I wlll have death knocking at his door. Welcome Mr. J. K. Your favourite table is reserved for you. Please come! Please be seated! Be seated! J. K. I don't understand what you just did. People give tips after eating. But you give in advance! Giving tips later is a custom. Giving it in advance is a guarantee of good service. Here is your favourite whisky... Chivas Regal. I don't want Chivas Regal today but Black Dog. Yes, sir. Here you are! Open it! What's wrong with you today? You're having Black Dog. The day I see a white butterfly... many black dogs start barking in my blood! I have Black Dog on that day. I think, you are looking out for me. My name is J. K. Who doesn't know you in this city? I longed to see you. And I've met you today. My name is Vijaykumar Srivastav. Who doesn't know you too in this city? - What are you saying? - Please sit. - What wlll you drink? - Well... - I hope, you are not hurt, Mr. Vijay. - I'm fine! Sit comfortably! I thought there was a back rest... what were you saying? What wlll you drink? I refrain from drinks. The business that I am in... And the job that you are in... are very deeply related. If we unite, then it is an union. And if we do not unite, then is war! No, certainly not! No war! An union is good. Sangam is a nice place. By the way, how did you know that I am from Allahabad? I can make that out from your face. And I can judge the contents of a letter by seeing the envelope! You can judge the contents of a letter by seeing... very good. What was the need... there was no need to give this... Anyway, I'll accept it! You are leaving now, aren't you? Yes... I wlll leave. I shall take your leave, Mr. J. K. - Pleased to meet you. - Same here. Isn't this your llghter, Mr. J. K.? I llke what you have done. You have not seen anything yet, Mr. J. K. A whlle back, a ring adorned your hand. Now it is in my hand. - What do you do? - I am looking for a job. Nowadays, this is my job. You have got a job. This is my address. Come at nine in the morning. J. K. you have looked at your watch ten times... in the last ten minutes. I have seen you waiting before. But never with such impatience and restlessness. When old age waits for youth, it waits for real long. Really? There comes your youth! I was waiting for you Miss... What did you say, your name was, yesterday? You did not ask; I did not say. My name is Shalu. My ears are fllled with music just llstening to it! I wlll just show her the house and explain her work. Do not follow me tlll the city of Bombay is on fire! Go on! You are really crazy, Mathur! I had said not to follow me tlll the city of Bombay is on fire. - Bombay in on fire! - Meaning? A fly fell in the mllk which we were supposed to drink! And the fly was none other than Inspector Aslam Khan! Our truck entered inside India very easlly. It was stopped at many checkposts & then allowed to go. But there is no hope of it anymore. Because Aslam Khan is on duty in Bombay now. And you know very well... that nothing defers Inspector Aslam Khan from his duty. You can at least move your finger. You dial. I wlll give you the number. Vijay, what brings you here? This is an order for you from the Headquarters, uncle. You have been summoned to Chowpatty immediately. There's going to be a polltical meeting. The protection of the leaders is your duty. The entire force is present for their security. If that truck passes this post, then it wlll be disastrous. Do not worry, uncle. I am on duty here now. Let alone a truck, even a bird wlll not be able to fly. You go... Stop. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. AI right. Lift the barrier. Go. Welcome, Inspector. You have pleased me, Inspector. Name your price. Name my price? Mr. J. K. When a beggar wears an uniform... his demands are high. The ones who wlll give, have their pocket full! He has pleased me, Mathur. You too please him. He is your reward, Inspector Vijay. What was the need? I hope you have not hidden a video camera somewhere. One of my colleagues had got trapped. "Do not avoid looking at me Do not hide yourself from me." "Turn behind and look." "My body is on fire come near." "And touch me." "In bad times I wlll help you in need." "Come near, o stranger." "And let us be friends." "The moment of joy is here." "Lonellness wlll klll me." "Both of us wlll be mallgned." "Both of us wlll be blamed." "Eyes mirror one's feellngs." "Of this, the world is unaware." "Of this, the nights are aware." "Messages wlll conveyed with eyes." "Wonder when we wlll meet again." "Maybe, this would be the last night." "But let's talk our heart out." "And whlle we talk many names wlll be out." J. K. we are ruined. What happened? Our truck reached the godown... but Shahenshah seized it and disappeared. - Disappeared? - Yes. You know very well there were goods worth mllllons in it. Do not worry about your goods worth mllllons, Mr. J. K. Worry about your llfe. Which is going to last for a few moments. Oh God! Hey, where are you going? She is going to shoot. What's happened, J. K.? You have left me alone. What wlll happen now? Do not worry. Madam, as per Indian Penal Code 306 and 307... What is this?... He is allve! My llfe cannot be finished by a weakllng llke you. Look, how carefully I have kept my llfe. Don't you dare! Nobody wlll shoot. Her death wlll be caused only by me. I wlll certainly klll her. Hers wlll be a sensational death. Like a poet writing his best poem. Or a painter painting his llfe's most precious picture. Assume, I too am going to make a picture. But I wlll use your blood instead of colours. What are you doing, Mr. J. K.? You are unaware of how precious the llfe you want to take is. Meaning? Come here. Assume, you are playing with cards. And the opposite person accidentally throws a Joker. And you win a losing battle. How? Shahenshah has looted your goods. And Shahenshah's llfe is trapped under your claws. What are you implying? I mean... that Shahenshah has only one weakness. And that is, this girl. He wlll die but wlll not let her die. If you wish, I can strike the deal. Which deal? The deal between Shahenshah's love and your wealth. Return this girl to Shahenshah. In exchange, Shahenshah wlll return your goods worth mllllons. But who wlll tell Shahenshah that I'm wllllng to compromise? I wlll, sir. You just showered your gratitude on me sometime back. How can I forget that? Allow me to prove my loyalty. At the most, he wlll klll me. I am wllllng to do even do that for you. I am going... I forgot about the bag. Shower bullets on him! So that no Shahenshah wlll ever dare to rise my stature! - No! - Stop! Come here! I knew, that an immoral man llke you would do something so lowly! You had thrown some fireworks here. I think, you are fond of them. I wlll show you a sample of that. Uncle. I want to see what you have in your bag. In this... there are only some old flles. I wlll see today, which flles you have got. This is the money my friend gave to deposit in the bank. Have the dealers of death become your friends now? Tell me truthfully. Isn't this the bribe... that you received to let that truck go? I didn't know, you could sell your virtue for such a low price and sell your integrity. Where wlll I get the knife with which I can cut... your surname from next to your name? Uncle, you are my elder. You can do whatever you please. To hear it and bow my head before you, is my duty. Your duty was what you did not fulflll. Now it becomes my duty to tear your uniform with my hands. To tear the stars from your shoulders! This cap is the crown of every respectful pollceman. I feel llke trampllng it under my boots. The strength of the government is behind this baton. I want to break your bones with it. So that you won't be able to get up or llft your head. You have done what you had to, brother. Now, I wlll do what I have to. You have only torn his uniform. I wlll have his hide! If I knew, I would give birth to such a disgraceful son... then I would have torn my womb with my own nalls! I had this evll in my womb for nine months. You raised him for years. So that he would grow up and spit on his father's honour. And also disgrace you! Get out of my sight! Henceforth consider that I am dead for you. And you are dead for me! You have considered me dead. Then, before bidding farewell to this corpse, bless him. I promise you, mother. . .That I wlll not come in front of you tlll I restore my honour. Drugs worth mllllons seized. Read about J. K's lllegal business. Written by the famous crime reporter Mohammed Sallm. Editor Mohammed Sallm wlll not improve. Driver, go to Action Times. Do you wish to meet me? Tell me. My name is Mohammed Sallm. Have you written the report on drugs? Yes. My name has been publlshed in your papers once. It shouldn't be repeated. I can pay a price. You can name your price. You have come to the wrong place, Mr. J. K. This is a place where truth prevalls... Principles are neither sold... nor bought here. Then hear me out, young man. I may not be able to buy the pen. But I can definitely break it. Then hear me out too, Mr. J. K. Like every reporter, ink flows in my veins instead of blood. And as long as that ink flows... my pen wlll not tremble to write the truth. Then I wlll have to see whether my hands wlll tremble... to finish your work. He had publlshed my name in the newspapers. And I wiped off his name from the book of llfe. If any of you try to take my name... then his famlly and he'll have to face this bloody consequence. Wake up, Sallm. Wake up. It is time to go to your press Don't you have to go there? Why aren't you getting up from your sleep today? Are you seeing Shaheena's state? She has not shed a single tear. She has not screamed even once. If she does not have a catharsis... then it could prove fatal to her. So I want you to make her cry a lot. There is a llmit to sleeping! Wake up, Sallm! Whom are you trying to awake? He wlll never wake up. - Your Sallm is dead. - For God's sake, don't say that. You are calling my allve husband as dead? What else do I call him? Accept the catastrophe that has happened to you. Do not try to hide the truth behind your madness. Your Sallm is dead! You have become a widow! "O sister." "What do I say about any brother-in-law?" "God has made such a pair." "O sister..." Mr. J. K. Has sent these flowers. He is deeply stirred about such a young death. Wait! These flowers wlll not be put on Mr. Sallm's body. His corpse has just been bathed with the holy water. And the coffin has been brought from the Holy Mecca. J. K.'s sins cannot be placed on that! I witnessed this death. I was sllent tlll now for fear of my death. But now, I only fear God. So I wlll break this sllence. I wlll tell, who kllled Mr. Sallm. I wlll tell you... On whose orders did you shoot? If I reveal his name, then he wlll klll me. Even I wlll klll you but you wlll have to tell me his name. Tell. Tell! Tell J. K. that Srivastav has a warrant to arrest him. Haven't you been able to digest... the bribe that I threw before you? Or has a bone got stuck in your throat? You should count your bones properly. In the process of going to prison and coming out... there may be a difference in your counting! I have come to arrest you for the murder of crime reporter, Sallm. Here is your warrant. And here are the pieces of your warrant. Collect them, pick it up and get lost! The book of your crime wlll not close by tearing the warrant. It wlll be closed the day you die. And on the last page wlll be written, "The End." It wlll be wise if you extend your hands without a fuss... so that I can put handcuffs around it. Before you can arrest me, your dead body wlll be at my feet. Even if there is heap of corpses here... Then I wlll drag you over it and put you in prison. Mr. J. K. In prison? When great men llke Gandhi could get imprisoned. Then why not an imposter llke J. K.? Today, I reallsed, why this place is called... "Shaitan" (imposter) Chowk. Amazing! What am I seeing? Such a great man behind bars llke ordinary criminals? He is a great man and a great criminal. Nothing about him is ordinary. The matter wlll not end here. It wlll reach very far. Have you forgotten about the bag you got from J. K.'s home... and the envelope which I gave you. There wlll be no envelope which wlll not be opened Mr. Mathur. What won't open are the doors of this jall... where my criminal is imprisoned. - Then I wlll use my influence. - Who is the in-charge here? There comes your influence! Welcome Mr. Pathak and look... at what is happening in your administration. - Who is the in-charge here? - I am. My name is Vijaykumar Srivastav. Do you know, that for alleging and arresting... a decent man llke J. K., I can have you sacked? Firstly, I can have you arrested... for laying your hands on the uniform of a pollceman. As for the charges... The court wlll decide whether, it is true or false. You do not know, who I am. You are the leader of this unfortunate country. Who instead of strengthening the law.. Has come walking here to side the criminal. You forget your llmits due to the zeal of your youth and anger. Who has given you the right to arrest J. K? On the basis of suspicion for a grave crime llke murder? The law of the country has given me the right. I order you to open the door of the cell, apologise to J. K... and release him. You have no evidence. If you do, then present it. Here is the evidence, Commissioner. This newspaper has the victim's blood on it... and the fingerprints of the murderer. When the murderer came out of the press after kllllng... then, he was wiping his blood stained hands with this paper. Yes, J. K., I am yet allve. Maybe, nature had saved me... to have you hanged to death. Wlll you able to testify what you just did, .. At the court tomorrow? Yes! Do anything, Inspector! This lady wlll not reach the court to testify. Under no circumstances! Under no cost! I wlll show you, J. K. This lady wlll reach the court to testify. Under any circumstances! At any cost! Vijay, take my car and go. I wlll handle these men. - No, uncle. - Go! There is llttle time. The witness is here. You can see, why we have reached the court late. There was not a road, a junction in the city... where the murderers did not shower bullets on us. I have brought this lady to court, J. K. To testify against you. Did you witness the murder of editor, Sallm Mohammed, or not? I had some work outside the press... Answer only to the question you are asked! Did you witness the murder or not? No, I did not witness it. Is this not the newspaper... with which J. K. was wiping his blood stained hand outside? Yes, it is the same newspaper. It is the same newspaper, Your Honour. But as per the doctor's report... the fingerprints are not of a human but of an animal. There are many people working at the press... where the murder occurred. But why hasn't even one witness been presented to the court? Because the witness is made a victim... of a bullet before reaching here. I request the court to summon Rana Pratap Singh. You have testified that you shot on Mr. J. K's orders. I was forced to testify this at gun point. Who had you at gun point? He is lying, Your Honour. I fully agree with Inspector Srivastav, Your Honour. This man is lying. The truth is that the murder did not occur on J. K.'s orders.. But yours! - How dare you! - This is a fact. And if you do not plead gullty within a minute... then I wlll shoot you with this gun! You wlll have to testify that you were responsible! - Testify! - Yes, I am responsible. The bullet is as fake as this case made by the pollce. If a judge llke you can take the blame of a murder... committed by someone else... then how could this poor man... refuse to falsely testify at gun point? With this, ends all the defense. And the case has become crystal clear. The case framed by the pollce for murder, against Mr. J. K... is false. The court should acquit Mr. J. K.! That's his prerogative! The court has reached a verdict that the case against Mr.J. K... is false, baseless and lllegal. Therefore, the court acquits Mr. J. K. - Congratulations, Mr. J. K. - Congratulations, Mr. J. K. Twenty years ago... an inspector llke you had tried to trap me. Nothing happened to me. But that poor man hanged himself to death Inspector. Incidentally, his name was also Srivastav. Your case is not yet over, J. K. What nonsense! Didn't you hear the judge acquitting me! People llke you can never be acquitted. Your case may be over in this court. But it has not yet begun in my court. And where is your court? Wherever there is 'Shahenshah' (the Emperor)... there is a court. And this court wlll not be adjourned... tlll the book of your crime is not opened and read. "Brave men llke him are few:." "Brave men llke him are few." "Who break chains of crime and injustice." "And get things they set after." "His hands are so powerful." What is all this? I have dragged the man you had acquitted, Judge. You have acquitted him of murder. But I wlll prove it to you that there isn't a crime... which he has not committed. Or had his friends commit. Who are you? I am greater... than he is. My name is Shahenshah. By profession I am a Judge llke you are. Who makes his own law, apprehends his criminals... hears their cases and passes the verdict himself! This is contempt of court! I know, that this is contempt of court. I also know that he has used the wrong means to talk. But what could be worse for a court... than justice being incomplete and the truth being suppressed? I think, it wlll be unjust if we do not hear him. Before punishing you for contempt of court... the court, on its responsibllity... gives you a chance to speak! Then, hear a case which was presented in your court. And you had sentenced an innocent pollce inspector... to three months imprisonment for accepting a bribe. How can you say, that the Inspector was innocent? Ask yourself. Ask your lost conscience and your asleep soul. Which is not yet awake. If you still do not remember... then look into this old widow's eyes. Her young husband hanged himself to death. And left her all alone. The rains came and went in this city. But this widow's tears could not be controlled. The scars on her face are due to the mark left by your verdict... which was bllnd and deaf! Your deaf ear did not even hear her testimony. Who wanted to tell you that... two bags were exchanged on J. K.'s orders. One bag contained the layout of the bank robbery... and the secret recording by J. K... between him and the bank manager, Mr. Mathur. "As usual, your bank wlll open at 10 O'clock in the morning." "At exactly 12 O'clock, it wlll be looted." - " Looted? - Yes, looted". "The thieves wlll loot all the money from the bank". "Add..." Tell me, J. K., is this your voice or not? Answer or I wlll shut your voice forever! Yes... it is my voice. And now say in that beautiful voice... whether you had ordered for Julle's death or not. I had. That poor lady tried to escape your men all her llfe... to save her innocent daughter. Her daughter was broken into pieces by hunger and poverty... and even became a thief. When that thief encountered you for the first time in a hotel... you had said that you wanted to drink Black Dog whisky. For when you see a white butterfly... Many black dogs in your blood start barking! How... do you know... all this? I am aware because I know... how to collar black dogs! Today, I wlll remove all the black dogs within you. And leave them to attack your own flesh. We wlll demand justice from J. K.! Who are these people and why are they here? They are the people... who were enslaved by outside rule for 200 years. And who are llving in the mercy... of imposter llke J. K. Since the last 40 years. What about these poor people? After being enslaved for years... they had seen a wonderful dream of independence. And sometimes, leaders llke him auctioned it! And officers llke him made it llke a whore in a brothel! Do you know What a big crime it is... to put your hand on the uniform of a pollceman. Where have you worn a pollce officer's uniform? It is a cloth draped around the corpse of your conscience! A pollce uniform does proud on an officer llke Mr. Aslam. Who is a classic example of duty. Look into his eyes. And remember the day when J. K.'s truck of drugs... was going to come to Bombay. And you had sent Mr. Aslam to Chowpatty... for the security of this leaders. What wlll happen to this country, Judge? Where lowly people llke him become leaders. And thieves llke him, the city's pollce. The law of the country was once llke a king. But people llke J. K. And officers llke him... have made it a roadside beggar! I appeal to you to look at editor Sallm's case intently. I know that the paper presented to the court... had the blood of some animal and not a human being! Tell me, where you have hidden the actual newspaper? Answer, or your death wlll be publlshed... in the newspapers tomorrow. Forgive me, Shahenshah. I have children. The one who was murdered was also a son of some father. He too was going to be a father. Now tell me. Are you going to remove the paper, or shall I klll you? I wlll give you. Here it is, Judge. The newspaper containing Sallm Mohammed's blood is before you. And the fingerprint of the murderer, J. K., is present. Evidences of a murder are so easlly changed. And the footprints of the murderer are wiped off, Your, Honour. Innocent officers llke Srivastav hang themselves to death. And fearless people llke Sallm Mohammed are kllled. And murderers llke J. K. are acquitted! But you wlll not be acquitted in Shahenshah's court. The consequence you wlll face'll be a lesson for the criminals. And such an example for others... that its story wlll be heard and told for years. After this, the hands of the pollcemen wlll not shake... whlle arresting criminals. Nor wlll the hands of the judges shiver whlle writing a verdict. When this wlll happen, your honour... then the lost crown wlll be restored on the head of justice. And the dreams of these poor people wlll become allve again. A real dream of independence... a real dream of justice! Move! - My daughter! - Nobody dare move! Move! Stop! Ask your men to move back, Inspector Aslam! If anybody moves then. I wlll klll Shalu! J. K., my target is on your head. If you shoot Shalu... then I shall empty this revolver on your head! Save me, Shahenshah! Save me! Accept your crime. Say that you had made false charges... of bribery on inspector Srivastav. Say that you murdered editor, Sallm Mohammed-say it! Yes, I did. I...accept all my crimes. You have pleaded gullty... And Shahenshah has adjourned his court. Look at this rope intently, J. K. You'll see Inspector Srivastav's corpse hanging from it! You wlll see a helpless widow... a son. After dying, a father's corpse always questioned... his son for years... that your father's klller is yet allve. Why has he not yet been hanged? Who are you? Inspector Srivastav's son, Inspector Vijaykumar Srivastav. A pollceman's uniform was not enough... to reach criminals llke you. Therefore, I had to wear Shahenshah's attire. A son has accompllshed what his father could not. I wlll throw this rope to you, J. K. Hold it and cllmb up. "In the darkness of the night in the deserted streets." "In the darkness of the night in the deserted streets." "To wipe away every crime." "There comes a Messiah Whom people call as Shahenshah"
