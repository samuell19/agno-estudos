Until her coming of age, the enjoyment of my bequest will belong to her guardian, my cousin, Fernand de Keranic whom I choose to execute my will. In the eventuality of my young niece's demise, my cousin Fernand de Keranic will become my sole heir. The same will apply if she enters a convent, or is struck by a major infirmity, such as blindness or madness. Written entirely in my own hand. Part one A Summer in Brittany Suzanne now lives with her guardian in Brittany. But after a short while her heart awakens. And it is to her diary she confides her amorous secrets. Today I had the happiness of seeing and hearing him. This morning, in full Captain's uniform, he galloped across the Dunes ford. This evening at the hotel he played an andante by Popper on his cello. I have come here to be near you. I love you with all my soul, Suzanne. Tell me please, that I can hope. If you love me you will excuse this first letter and you will allow me to write again. Jean d'Erguy. I am tired of waiting. Your marriage to your cousin cannot be concluded. If after a period of one month you have failed to reimburse the F 200,000 that you have extorted from me I will take you to court. If I cannot be paid, I will at least render society a service by unmasking the rogue who hides beneath the guise of a gentleman. The time is propitious. Fernand de Keranic leads his cousin to visit the rocks of Kador. Suzanne, I have a confession to make. This is not your guardian who speaks to you, it is... Suzanne, will you be my wife? I have come here to be near you. I love you with all my soul, Suzanne. Tell me please, that I can hope. If you love me you will excuse this first letter and you will allow me to write again. Jean d'Erguy. Misfortune to him if he crosses my path. In the shadows of his office, Fernand de Keranic listens to the voices which infinitely repeat the terms of the will: "In the eventuality of my young niece's demise..." Come tomorrow afternoon to the Rocks of Kador I will be in the cave where you will see a fire. Suzanne. The following day. Excuse me, Suzanne... Forget my error and let us remain friends. Shooting seagulls near the rocks of Kador. In one hour, the tide will reach the depths of the cave: and the body of Suzanne will join that of the man to whom she had given her heart. The sea carries away the boat, plaything of the wind and the waves. All through the night, Suzanne, crazed, yells helplessly in the face of a raging sea. In the morning, fishermen discover the stranded boat. The Public Attorney investigates on site aided by Fernand de Keranic. Interrogation Captain d'Erquy impossible condition desperate The prosecutor enquires into the condition of the unfortunate Suzanne de Lormel. In the office of L'etang de Jeande. Sir, At the end of my enquiry at Kador, at the very locations of the drama, I was able to visit Suzanne de Lormel, god-daughter of the Count de Keranic. I came to realise the young girl presented undoubted symptoms of insanity that the careful attentions of her guardian have been unable to contradict. It is therefore open to you to execute the terms of the will to which the Count drew your attention. Public Attorney Part Two The Method of Professor Williams Finally healed of his wounds, Jean d'Erquy rests in the town of Neuilly. My dear Jean, I am delighted to learn you are in better health. If only our dear Suzanne could awaken from this nightmare! Alas, it seems the poor child will be far too long trapped in the darkness that this mysterious drama has plunged her. But, if I can believe a recently read scientific review, it seems progress is possible where all cure has been forbidden. Professor Williams' studies have given evidence of results. Do you think he could study our dear Suzanne's case? My dear Sir, let me stop you right away. The case you submit is exemplary in the quest for my method's research. Communication from the Academy of Medicine on the observations of Professor Williams on the application of cinematography to psychotherapy. Well, we'll met at Kador, Professor. Now, all that remains is to film some scenes on the high seas! Look, Suzanne... She cries... She is saved! A short while later at Jean d'Erquy's villa. This andante so soft under your bow, at the setting sun, awakens in my heart echoes of the past. Come to me. Suzanne. This writing... But, it's not the same! Come tomorrow afternoon to the Rocks of Kador I will be in the cave where you will see a fire. Suzanne. Upstairs, close to Suzanne. Do you remember having written me these lines, darling? Madame Dorlysse, please fetch me some handwriting of the Count de Keranic! Jean d'Erquy is now resolved to unmask the criminal. The Count is attending a masked ball given by the Baron de la Nemeur. The town house of de la Nemeur. The office of the Chief of Police. Do you remember having written this? Come tomorrow afternoon to the Rocks of Kador Epilogue. Subtitles: Corvusalbus
