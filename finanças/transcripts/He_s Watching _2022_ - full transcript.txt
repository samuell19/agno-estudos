We're going to use their pool, their crystal clean pool, which Lucas promises not to pee in. - Hey! I would never pee in their pool. - You would, and you have. - Well, I mean, maybe a little. - All right, ready? - I'm ready. - Okay, 1, 2, 3, go! - ♪ You could possibly wear ♪ ♪ Mess it up ♪ ♪ Time is up ♪ - Hey, guys.

So why'd you do that last night? - Why'd I do what? - Can you sit down? - Yeah. Why are you recording me? - I'm trying to get your confession tape, Lucas. - What confession tape? - Why'd you leave all the stuff in the middle of the hallway? - What stuff? - So despite your son being a dick, trying to freak me out, I'm still being a good sister and making him practice his piano. And later, we're going out for some exercise. We're going to Chinatown. Action. - Hi, I'm Dad, and I'm a famous TV director. I'm superstitious about this hat, and the hat is, like, so important because everything will go wrong if I don't use it on set. - The blue one's the lucky hat, dumbass. - Better go get the blue one, then! - Take off Dad's lucky hat. - No. - Take it off. - No. - Dude, that's his special hat. Take it off. - No. Hey, you want my movie to fall apart? - I don't, but I also don't want you to lose it and mess it up for Dad. Wow, okay. - Where do you think you're going with that? - Bringing the hat back to its rightful home. - Now the movie's gonna be cursed, thanks to you. - Bye-bye. - And that's all I know. - Iris, why are you recording? - The mysterious disease that has already... - I already told you why I'm recording. - Killed over 2,000 people in Los Angeles County alone... - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. I have to record it. It's history. - I know it's history, but why record it? - Dude, what is your problem? - I don't have a problem. I'm just asking you a simple question. - Okay, can you shut up now? - I would, but you're being super annoying, making me listen to the news all day. - I'm being annoying? - Yeah. - Okay. - Are nothing but a theater being performed by the devil seeking to get his due. - Get up, dickhead. Wake up, freak. Why'd you do it? - What did I do? - Come on. Why'd you record me sleeping in the middle of the night? - No, I didn't. - Dude. The severed fingers? The knife? How'd you do that?

The nurses are working hard. The nurses are working short. - Stop playing the news. It's getting very annoying. - Or you could stop being mean and complaining. - Why do you keep playing the news? - 'Cause I feel like playing the news. - Seriously. Stop. - Go in the other room and annoy the cat if you don't want to hear the news, Lucas. - The stench and taste of death in their mouth. - Leave me alone. Hi. Iris is showing me or... interrupting everything I do with the news. And all the time, it's just nothing but people dying and people sick and-- What? Iris? What? Iris! Where are you? - What? Why'd you turn your lights off? - The lights-- - Well, why don't you just click the-- - I don't know what's going on. The lights turned off. - You turned off your lights. - What? No, I didn't. - How else-- that's not possible. - Go check the video. Go check the video. - Fine, I will check the video. - Yeah, it has all the proof. - I know what you're doing. - I'm not doing anything. - I know what you're doing. Okay, all around the house, something's going on with the lights. Not going off, like in the video Lucas forwarded. But there's a weird flickering happening, like a candle or something. I tried to tell Lucas it was probably just electrical. But he doesn't believe a word I say. And now, after being a royal dick to me for the last three days, he's acting like a helpless little lamb and begging me to be with him at all times. As if the lights flickering, they're gonna kill him. So we go over to our neighbors to ask if they can come over and give him some adult-style comfort. But they're not home. And now here we are, and it's happening in your office too, which, by itself, I wouldn't find very creepy, but, Dad, I have to ask. What the hell is the closet creeper? I'm hoping he's a character idea for one of your movies and you didn't really write this. All right, time to say good night to Mom and Dad. - Good night, Mom and Dad. - Anything else you want to say before I leave? You could say, "I love you." - I love you. - Okay, I'm gonna go to bed. Good night. - Wait, wait, wait. Can you stay with me, please, please? - Lucas, I already told you I'm not sleeping in the bed with you. You just have to be a big boy. - How am I supposed to be a big boy? That makes me sound younger than I am. Seriously, it's not how old I am or how not-old I am. I'm actually scared. You're scared sometimes, right? - Should I close your curtains or something? - No. That's not gonna change anything, please. - Dude, I'm going to bed. - I'm begging you. Why is it so hard just to stay with me? - Because I don't want to. - Iris, if you leave, that's really mean and jerky of you. - Mean and jerky of me? - Yeah. - Okay, sweet dreams. - All right, see you later, jerk. - You don't even know what mean and jerky is, Lucas. - Jerk, jerk--you're a jerk! - Punk-ass. - This is my noisemaker.

But our front yard was not our front yard. Then for some reason, I was transported back in time. But Lucas was still in the future. So I flew back and asked him to come with me. Then I realized we weren't time traveling at all. We were watching a film you'd made out of our memories without asking us permission. You weren't there in any of the images, but almost like I could see you through my closed eyelids, watching me, filming me while I was sleeping. Only it wasn't exactly you. You were something else, something dark. You were in a costume, a costume I'd seen before, but I couldn't quite place it. Finally, it came to me what it was. And there you were, just like in my dream, on the poster for that demon movie you made last year. Anyway, it's creepy here without you. And Lucas is acting weird, so please get better soon. Okay. - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. I've been learning this song while you're away, and it's called-- oh, I don't know. But you'll really like this song, and it's a classical piece, I'm pretty sure. Doesn't sound like one, but I'm pretty sure it is. Okay, I'm gonna play it. - ♪ I put my head on the pillow ♪ ♪ First thing I see is your face ♪ - So I was in a pretty good mood. And then I walked into the living room, and I found Lucas' poetry that he left me. "Keep recording his scenes or suffer the consequences. Iris, this means you." - I told you I didn't do it. - What are you saying, a goblin did it? - Maybe so. - Jackass. - Were you gonna offer me any? Why not? - Because. - That's not nice. Sharing is caring, Lucas. - Yeah, I don't care, so I won't share. - You're such a dick. - It all adds up. - It adds up to you being a dick. - All you've been doing is just blaming me for everything. So should I share my strawberries? - If you don't share those strawberries, I think I might murder you. - These are my strawberries. They're not yours. - Lucas, when someone asks you for a strawberry... - No! No! - You give them a strawberry. - Get away from me! - Give it. - Stop! - Give me those strawberries! - They're my strawberries! - Those are not your strawberries! - No! - They're our strawberries! But if you want them back, I'll happily smush them up your stupid nose. Yeah? Want it? - Give me back my fucking strawberries! No! Stop! Put down the chair. Mmm. - What the fuck? - I know I'm not really supposed to be in Dad's office, but I came in here looking for Iris, and I found this creepy video she was cutting together. I don't know why anyone would make a movie like this. I mean, what is that thing? But maybe most freaky of all, what kind of psycho paints strawberries black and then red again? I hope she didn't want to poison me. - It's actually turning out kind of good. I'm like Bob Ross. But I don't think Bob Ross paints anything other than tr--I've seen, like, every episode of that show, and I don't think he paints anything other than lakes and trees. But--and good for him, but it's--I don't know. What if he did, like, a city? Do you think he could paint a city? - Probably not, actually. I don't think he could do it. - Lucas does not like Bob Ross, but he just needs to get into it, and then maybe he'll understand. - Can you see? Hold up. Okay, there you go. - Lucas, go to bed.

I won't. - Dude, just so you know, I came down here to have some alone time. - I know, but, Iris? - Yes? - Some really weird videos showed up on my camera roll. - What? - They were just on the camera rolls that one of us shot. - You're not making sense. What are you talking about? - There's just videos. I don't think either of us took them. - What are you talking about? - Just look on my video camera roll. - Give it to me. - I don't know who or what.

Now, I didn't shoot it. I don't understand. Obviously, there's no way he could have shot it himself. - Iris, what did that? - Shh. Just be quiet. - Is there a hidden camera or something? - I don't know. I don't see anything. - Lucas, I think we have to leave the house. - I don't think that's gonna help. - Why would you say that? - Because leaving the house doesn't seem to change anything at all. - How would you know that? - There's other videos in the camera roll I haven't shown you yet. - What videos? - Like, remember how we went into Brenda and Jay's house and did a bunch of recordings of us cannonballing and stuff? - Yeah. - Well, we weren't alone. - What do you mean, we weren't alone? - What I'm saying is, there was something in the water with us that day... Something I think can follow us anywhere. Some of the shots, we did, but others were shot by I don't know what. - I don't know. What is this? Lucas. Lucas? It's scary when it's dark.

What the fuck? What do we do? Lucas, what do we do? - I know we're not supposed to, but... I think we should see Mom and Dad. - What you're about to see is what Lucas and I saw when we came back from the hospital to try to-- to try to see you. Lucas freaked out and decided to go ask the neighbors for help. - Cath! Eli! Anybody home? - But nobody came to the door. We called all your friends, and no one answered. Grandma Marsha isn't answering either. But the worst part is, Lucas didn't even shoot these videos. These were just texted to us from some unknown sender. It's like whoever's recording us can see right through our eyes. - Anthony? Anthony, Georgia! Hello? - The streets are pretty much empty, other than stuff like this.

Won't the phone die if we leave it on all night? - No, it's on a motion sensor. So, like, if anything moves, it just-- it'll just record for, like, ten seconds. And then it shuts off. - What if it's too dark? - There's a flash. Like, right now. - Bike light. - Iris? - What? - Maybe instead of thinking of these things as just words on a list, we could think of them as ideas. Like, the photo might not be a picture, but it could be us or you and me together. - Writing it down. "You and me together." But it doesn't make any sense. Okay. Watch. Where's the apple? Lucas, where's the apple? - I don't know. - Apple's gone. - I can go get another. - Okay. Watch, apple, nail, timer, U-shaped magnet, and a brown egg. Hmm. - Makes no sense at all. - Well, wait, okay. If we do this, you're right. It makes no sense. But if we do this... W-A-N-T... M-O-R-E. - Wouldn't that just be a coincidence? - I don't think that's a coincidence. - So what happens if we go back and try the other one now? - Let's see. - H-H-T-C-R-A-O. - That doesn't spell anything. - Wait, there's more. Egg. Still doesn't spell anything. - Iris, I have a thought. - What's your thought? - You know how I'm always asking for oranges all the time? - I guess so. Why? - Remember Mom got so mad because we kept on running out and I kept on begging for more and more? - Where are you going with this? - It's basically the same thing as the ring. - My ring? - Yeah. Wait, where'd it go? - It's here on my finger. I put it on. Why? - That's not just any ring that you own. That's the one that you were super jealous of Ruby for having, so she had to give it to you. - Yeah. - I remember you almost stopped being friends because she wouldn't lend it to you and she thought you were being greedy. - Yeah. - I'm saying maybe we should write down "greed" or "jealousy" as one of our words. - Okay. But honestly, I feel like you could see anything you want in these things. - That could be true, but remember when Dad got me that bike light and I freaked out 'cause I wanted the square one instead of the round one? - No, what are you talking about? - Dad said something like, "Well, it's too bad. You don't get to choose." And then we screamed at each other for, like, the whole entire day. - Sounds like the kind of stupid fight you two might have.

Let me see that. - Hang on. - Give it. - I said hang on. Iris, I think I know exactly what it's trying to say. - What does it say? - Like, I think the lock means something about how things are set in stone and can't be undone. And the magnet, it's about a trade. But I don't think it's about the trade we made. And I think the thing with Grandpa Frank and the seeds means it all started with him. The Super 8 camera's obviously about Dad's movies. And I think the hammer might be about how Dad convinced Mom to have me. - What are you talking about? - Remember how she only wanted one kid and her excuse was something like the house is too small? - Right, he promised to build her a new room. Brought home a hammer and nails. - Iris, have you ever heard about things called the Wanderers? - Why does that sound so familiar? - According to what I searched, it's a kind of demon, a kind of demon who wants to confuse and scare people into doing what it wants. And the reason it sounds so familiar... look at this description of Dad's movie. - "A father sells his children "to a demon known as the Wanderer in exchange for fame and fortune." - Iris, I think this movie was based on something real, something that maybe even started before Dad was born. - So you think Grandpa Frank made a deal with a demon? - Uh-huh. Then Dad. And now I think he wants to make a deal with us. - What kind of deal? - Well, like, my baby handprint and your childhood bracelet, that means something to do with kids. - What does that mean? - I think it wants us to give it more than what Dad gave it. - More than two kids? I didn't tell Lucas this because I didn't want to scare him. But the other night, I had a dream. I was lost in some dark forest, looking for him. And I couldn't find him. It was vague, but somehow I knew I had allowed something awful to swallow us both up. I woke up so ashamed. But now... I don't think it was my fault at all. I don't have any proof. But I believe everything Lucas says about you. Did you sell us to it? For fame or money? Whatever the fuck you want? You sold your own kids? You're a piece of shit. - Hello, my name is Dr. Susannah Rogers, and thank you for visiting our page today, where we will be discussing the nature of demons and strategies people sometimes use to attempt to communicate with them. Throughout the ages, humanity has tried to access the spirit world, be it through séance, trance, transcendental psychotropic experiences, and through extreme behaviors such as fasting for weeks, speaking in tongues for days, or the application of extreme pain, such as branding or fire. Others have used Ouija boards or the recitation of ritual prayer often written in a language that the speaker themselves does not know. The thing that binds all of these rituals together is not the specifics of the effort but the intent and the belief of the summoner of the spirit. Demons, particularly Wanderers, know when a person is desperate and in need of help, not because of the words that they speak or the actions that they take but because of the feeling of the person speaking those words and taking those actions. They can feel the sincere need exhibited in your prayer. Little else matters, certainly not the order or the recitation of ancient ceremonial rites. No. The demon prefers novel, personalized approaches to summoning, because those who create their own ritual with pure and true belief are often those who are most corruptible. End of message. Have a safe journey. - With this, my deepest, darkest secret, I wish for you to speak. - With this, my deepest, darkest secret, I wish for you to speak. - For this, my sacred childhood object, I wish for you to speak. - With this, given to me by my beloved grandmother, I wish for you to speak. - For giving you these herbs from a plant I planted, I wish for you to speak. - With a memory from my past, I wish for you to speak. - With this beautiful bottle I found, I wish for you to speak. And this watch, given to me by my Grandpa Frank, I wish for you to speak. - With this fire... We beg of you to speak. - I don't think it's gonna work. Hey, Lucas. Lucas, it worked. What is this? Is this Grandpa Frank's melodica? - Remember when he gave it to us? He was like, "If you want to, you could be a famous musician." Maybe it's here to remind us of that. - What about my crystals? - Those were your most precious things when you were little. I think it's saying it can get us more stuff like that if we do if it wants. And this picture of Dad with the dead flowers, when I first looked at it, I was sure it meant that Dad was about to die. - You think Dad's dead? - Maybe. Or maybe the demon just wants us to believe that. This stuff over here seems to mean it wants us to choose which way to go. And with those things it somehow unburned, I'm guessing it wants us to see how powerful it is. - What about your old bike lock? - I'm pretty sure it's saying we're going to be taken. - Taken by the demon? - Yeah. And I think this watch here means we only have until 3:17 a.m. to decide. - Decide whether to take its offer? - Yeah. - Why 3:17 a.m.? - I have no idea. - What about the journal? What's Dad's story journal doing here? - Well... either it's telling us if we go with it, we get to write our own story, or could just be-- could just be wanting us to sign our names. - And the bell? What do you think the bell is? - The bell means nothing to me, and neither do Grandpa's old opera glasses. But the fire being on, it's probably a warning. - You didn't start the fire? - No. - You're saying the fire's saying that's how it's gonna feel if we don't give it what it wants? - Yeah. - Do you think Mom and Dad get to live if we agree to do what it's asking? - I don't know. - Do you know what this is? - I think it's a song from Dad's new movie. - ♪ Start playing guitar ♪ ♪ These chords will take you far ♪ - There he is.
