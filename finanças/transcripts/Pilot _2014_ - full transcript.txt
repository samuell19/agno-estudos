Who are you? What do you want? Know what? Fuck you. Your little girl needs you, Gigi. Mommy? Mommy? - Bonjour, sweetheart. - Bonjour, Gigi. - You look sleepy. - Oh, I just woke up. I'm glad you called. How is everything at home? - Everything's fine. - Yeah? Marie decided to dress herself this morning. - Oh, yeah? - Hey, it's mommy. Hi, mommy, it's Marie. That's Marie Fini? Yes, it's Marie Fini Genereau. Wow. Hello, Marie Fini Genereau. Bonjour. Here's daddy, mommy. I guess she's got better things to do, mommy. Yes. What time's your audition, babe? 11:00. I need coffee, Richard. Go, get coffee. Call me after. - I love you, babe. - You too. Je t'aime. Bye-bye. You think you can treat me like this and not pay for it, bastard? You obviously have no idea who you're dealing with, mister. Aw, yeah, you better believe I do. What do you think... you think... you think you can treat me like this and not pay for it, bastard? You obviously have no idea who you're dealing with, mister. Oh, yeah, you better believe I do. Thank you. - For you. - Thanks, ms. Genereau. You think you can treat me like this and not pay for it, bastard? You obviously have no idea who you're dealing with, mister. - You have real balls, bitch. - Oh, you better believe I do. Jesus, I hope that gun's not real. And what if it were, bastard? That was great. Thanks, Gigi. Thank you. Merci beaucoup. I have to say I love this role. I'm excited to play a heroine. To be honest, I think you might be too young for the role and probably a little too sexy for it. I can do it another way for you. Let's try the woman's daughter, okay? Uh, you can just give me a cold reading and maybe a little less accent. Page 88 at the top, three lines. It says that I am, um, 20-something drug addict prostitute in a relationship with a married couple and that I am naked and tied up? So french. Thank you. Two males, one African-American, one white. I'll meet you back in the lobby, okay. - Okay. - Let's move out. What? Never seen a clown before? No funny business, clowny. I'll be off in a moment. Fucking hell. What do we do now? Okay, everyone's gonna be okay. Just relax. This is officer Munoz. This is officer Munoz. Do you read me? Does anyone read me? Is anyone on this frequency? Isn't there a phone on the panel? No. There's a button here. Well, press the fucking button. Jesus. This is officer Munoz. I'm stuck in the elevator, guys. 10-13. - What is a 10-13? - It's police bullshit for "we're fucked in the fucking asshole." do you mind, sir? Yeah, I fucking mind. Do you mind? Come on, what's it been, like, two minutes? Can everyone please just shut up? Doesn't anyone's phones work? Well, mine is... is... it's so dark. - I don't know if I can find it. - I don't have any bars. Nah, cell phone bollocks. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna get out of here. - Why isn't anyone responding? - And what's that fucking alarm? You're not helping things, sir. Can you just pry open the doors? Let me try. I can do it. Come on! Fucker! I'm not feeling well. So... what about the ceiling? Can we just open that up and climb out there? Ladies first. I don't appreciate your humor. Nobody's climbing anywhere. I have a condition, young lady... just hang on, ma'am. Can't you use your stick? The stick on your belt? We're in the parking garage. Come on. I'll help you down. One at a time. Be careful. Be careful. Hang on to me, okay, okay. I got you. You're all right. Okay, okay. Let's go. Hello. What? - Thank you. - Okay. Merde! I can fucking manage. I'm not a bleeding spastic. The exit gate's locked down. Fucking hell. So we take the fucking stairs. I don't fucking believe it. Did anyone try the other elevator? There must be a power outage. Yeah, but why are the lights still on? Those are the emergency lights. What is the fucking emergency? And how soon will this be over? I need something in my stomach. No way. Hold that door, hold that door! Hold that door, hold that door! Oh, shit. - What's the problem? - You just locked us in. - A fucking dungeon. - What are you talking about? Are you sure the exit gates are locked? Ah! - Hey, asshole! - Who are you people? Come on, let's try to lift it. - Who's that? - Hey! - Help! - Help! Help! Help! No, don't leave! No! He was looking right at us. Maybe he went for help. What are you saying? We're... we're trapped down here? Why are you dressed like a clown? Because he is a fucking clown. This is officer Munoz. Does anybody in the building read me? Come in. I'm not even getting static. Honey, let's just call 911, huh? Nobody's getting reception. Oh, that alarm is giving me a headache. It's giving us all a headache. Is that your car? Why is the trunk open? Stop! - Hey! - Turn around, bitch! - Put your gun down! - You put yours down. - Put it down and let go of her! - Put yours down! Put it down and let the woman go! Let her go! I'll fucking pull the trigger! I'll do it right here! Everybody just back away. Nobody fucking move! Just take your finger slowly off the trigger. Can you do that, D? Boom. Her head explodes like a pumpkin. - You hear what I'm saying? - Oh, my god, oh, my god. Please, I've got a little girl. - She's got a little girl, D. - No, no, no, no. I'm getting the hell out of here, and I'm taking this woman with me. Okay, everybody just move behind me. This man escaped a prison bus last night and eluded a manhunt... he's a violent killer. I didn't murder that woman. I'm innocent. So put the gun down, and we'll discuss it. Can you do that, D? Don't you fucking smooth talk me. Hey, man. Whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way to negotiate. Nobody's talking to you. It's okay, I'm a lawyer. I do this for a living. Please, just put your guns down. That's the only sensible option here. The only sensible option would be to let me just walk up out of here. We're trapped down here, D. Now, I'll lower my gun if you go first. You put your gun on the floor. I can't give up my gun, I'm sorry. Who's making the fucking rules? - He's gonna kill me! - Okay, okay. I'll put my gun on the ground if you let the woman go. But I want you to do the same. Is that a deal? Well, I have to sit down. I'm... I'm... I'm really... I'm not feeling well. Fuck. That's the best you're gonna get. You're gonna be okay, ma'am. - You scared me to death. - I had no other choice. I'm an innocent man, wrongly accused. I fucking believe him, don't you? Well, I'm glad you're all having a good time. Now I want the fuck out of here! We're locked in here, D! There's been a power outage, and the doors are sealed, so you can just cool off, okay? Uh, excuse me? Your friend is bleeding really bad. Fuck him. He ain't my friend. That fool followed me out the hole. He's gonna die like that. You shouldn't have fucking shot him then. It's a gutshot. Nothing y'all can do but let the motherfucker die in peace. I'm gonna try to radio for help, all right? - I'm going for my radio... - Stay off the fucking radio! Hey, hey, D, is it? The officer's right. We're trapped down here. Now, the only thing we can do is work together and discuss a reasonable solution to this problem, okay? I look reasonable to you, motherfucker? Hey, I got no dog in this fight. Then stop fucking lawyering me! All right. You figure it out, cool. Somebody has to figure it out. Can we just please talk about this, okay? Yeah, let's discuss how you locked the fucking door on us. We're down here because all the other floors were locked. Yeah. How did you get onto the stairs? Why were you in the stairwell? Now there's a girl you don't meet every day. Very fucking high class. - Shut up. - I thought you were a lawyer. Same fucking difference. No, I never said I was a lawyer, and what does it matter what I do anyway? All the other floors were locked? That's what I'm trying to tell you, yeah. That's good then. That means there could be others on the stairs. Getting their own fucking blow jobs. Hey, old lady's in trouble over there. Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? Oh, my god. Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am? Let me get in there. Let me get in there. Okay. Ma'am. Listen to me, listen to me. - Ma'am. - Looks like she's dying. Ma'am, you said you had a condition. Can you indicate that? Maybe she's having a heart attack. I've got an AED in my car. Check in her bag if she's got a prescription or anything. Maybe she's diabetic. I got an auntie in Tallahassee who's a diabetic. - She could be in insulin shock. - No, you gotta give her sugar. - Bleeding sugar. - Just, like, candy or gum - or something, anything. - Here, sugar. - She's trying to say something. - What do I do? What do I do? Uh, put it on her tongue. - Let me get in there. - Okay. Hold her head. Move aside. See, this is what happens. This is what happens when I don't eat. Are you going to be all right now? Uh, there's some cheese and crackers in my car from the airline. The keys are in my purse. Hey, what happened to that black man? I could have just shot you in the back. There are cops out on the street, D. How far do you think you'll get running around with a shotgun? I ain't just doing this for me. I'm working to spring all y'all. We don't need your help, D. But you do need my cooperation. Now what does that alarm mean? I think the building could be on fire. What? Get after it, man. Crank up that gate. Well, be my guest, Beverly Hills. All right, one of you, go help him. Jesus Christ. Come on. Give me a hand. All right. I'm a clown. I blow up balloons. No, come on. We need your help! Come on, I think you were making progress. - 3fucking help. - Why can't he just slide under? Yeah, you can fit under there. Don't need y'all's fucking advice. Move, fuck it. Just move. Now you be thinking real hard about shooting an unarmed man. You put a gun to a woman's head, and you're telling me what to do? I let the foreign chick go, didn't I? Tell that to the fucking judge. Let's get the fuck out of here. Fuck. Innocent man, wrongly accused. All right, your turn. Let's go. - My foot! - Look out! Oh, my god! Come on! Lift it! Are you all right? I think so, but it hurts. Oh, great, now we're really fucking trapped in here. You have to go and get help. I'll find someone to get you out. Find a police officer, and tell them my name is officer Munoz. Where are my cheese and crackers? Oh, my god. Sir! Sir, can you help me, sir? I've got my hands full right now. There are people trapped in a parking garage. A man is dying. You're gonna have to find an EMT. An EMT? Where do I find an EMT? Help. I need your help. A lot of people here need help. There is an officer trapped in a parking garage just over there with a group of other people. - A police officer? Is he hurt? - She's... no, she's not hurt, but she needs your assistance. They all need... there are officers in trouble here on the street. Officers down. Can you tell me what happened? Nobody knows what's happening. Nobody knows how many are affected or how widespread this whole mess is. I need to get word to my husband and daughter in New York. Forget it, lady. Power's out. The city's in gridlock. We haven't had communication since yesterday. Yesterday? What do you mean? Go, go, go! Stay together! - Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! - Mom! - Mommy, help me. I need to get up to my room. - Nobody's allowed upstairs. - Out of my way. But I've got to get up there. I'm sorry, but it's for security. Um, who do I talk to? You're talking to him. I've got cash. I can pay you. - Come on. - Do you know what's happening? End of the world, for all I know. Merde, merde, merde! Damn it. Come with me. I'll give you the money back. - Be quiet and keep moving. - You know how to use that? I'm trained, and I'm deadly. 'Cause I don't want an accident. Here. - What do you want me to do? - Open it. There's no power to the locks. Kick it in. Well, you got real balls, bitch. You'd better fucking believe I do. Out of my way. Ms. Genereau, ms. Genereau. Over here. Hurry up. There's still room. They said the airport is open and that flights are still leaving. - They said that? Who said that? - The bus driver. He thinks he can get there by taking the back roads. Come on, he's got one seat open. Come on. Hey, can you hear me? - Sir, do you hear me? - Yeah, I fucking hear you. Is there anything I can do for you? Fucking put a bullet in my head. And then put one in that fucker d's. What the fuck are you doing? This is absolute madness! They've been gone for over an hour. - We're getting out of here. - Thank god. Girl's thinking on her feet. First drink's on me, dear. There it is again. What the hell is that? You wanna die down here? Come on. Look. On three. One... two... what's that noise? Where have you been? What the hell happened to you? Come on. Spit it out. What is it? You don't wanna leave here. What are you talking about? There is no power, no nothing. Something terrible is happening. - Then I have to get out there. - No, you don't understand. The police have lost all control. Oh, you can always count on a fireman. That's no fucking fireman. Figured y'all would still be here. Where'd you get that truck? It's a rescue vehicle, ain't it? Look like y'all need rescuing. Now we're getting serious. How y'all like it behind bars? This looks absolutely impossible. Yeah, well, that's what I told myself this morning, but here I fucking am. Why did you come back for us? Been called a monster my whole life. Why did you come back? - I promised those people. - Yeah? Then we're both fucking stupid. - What are you doing? - Move, move, move, move. Fucking open the door. Shit, shit, shit. You okay, dude? - You okay? - Yes. Get the hell out of my way. - You okay? Here you go. - Whoa, all right. You're no fucking fireman! He fucking hijacked this truck. Come on, you bitch! - Can we get out? - Stay in the fucking car. Hey, hey! Move the fuck out of my way. Whose fucking idea was this? Easy! - Move! - What are they doing? They're trying to roll us. I think they want to kill us. Move right now! Stop! Hey! Go, go, go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! All right! All right, easy! Jesus. Ah, worse than a fucking plane crash. At least you crash-landed in Bel Air. This is where the old lady lives? I just had these gates fixed. Graciela, can you open the gate? Graciela, I'm home, honey. Who's Graciela? Is that your daughter? She's my housekeeper, Graciela, but I don't know why she's not answering me. She's not answering because she can't hear you. The power's out. Maybe we could just climb over. If she had a bleeding bar, we could. I knew this was a bad idea. We should have just gone to the station. What we should have done is gone home, but you saw the situation out there, right? She says she has food for us here. Dining in the fucking dark, so... hey, y'all, we need a place to sleep. Okay, everyone just stop, - and let's figure this out. - Just stop? You're an officer. You haven't... - is that the best you got? - That's your plan? Everyone get out of the way! Pfft! Graciela, I'm home, dear. Wow. You live here all by yourself? With Graciela, wherever she is. Fucking died and went to heaven. This house must be worth a fortune. It's worth 100 million if it's worth a penny. Who makes $100 million? Not all the clowns in the world. Excuse me. I'd like to try the telephone. Well, there's one in the kitchen. Hi, mom. Give me a kiss to the camera. - Mwah. - Oh! - Seafood, look at that. - And to daddy too? - A kiss. - Look at daddy. no? No? Just mommy. You prefer mommy, right? Shy in front of the camera. Any luck with the phone? There wasn't even a dial tone. Hmm. This food's gonna spoil. Do you know there is no water? I think the shit has hit the fan. You're not saying this is some kind of terrorist attack or something. I work with people who have their hands on the hot buttons, people who work at the highest levels. And they all assure me it's not a matter of "if," you know, but "when." * out came the sun and dried... * no, no, no, no, no. I can't believe this. Me neither. Caviar. Oh. I'm gonna fucking marry this woman. Graciela? Graciela? Honey? Graciela? Graciela? Where are you... oh, there's a strange man in the house! It's okay, don't be frightened. Who are you? What do you want? It's okay. I don't want anything. - What did you do with Graciela? - I didn't do anything with her. Then what are you doing in my house? Nothing. I came here with you? It's me, David. The clown. You people are trying to kill me. How much that fucking set you back? I just pay her health insurance. You're fucking shitting me, right? Her cobra plan was, like, a grand a month. I figure it's a win-win. Obamacare cover that? It better, or she's shit out of luck. I tell ya, I got a fucking cobra plan for her. Ya mind if I mixed in? I was just getting out, actually. Ah, right. Then may I assist you with your cape? We're really no different, are we, than this helpless little bee? We got the milk of human kindness. You know, I'm really frightened about all this. Allow the shelter of my arms. How will we pay for our sins? As part of the health plan? The book of revelation? Have you ever read it? I mean, have you ever really read it? You speaking of the bible? Maybe that explains everything. What it is John saw about the serpent and who the prostitute is. I prefer "escort" or "fille de joie." or moggy fucking skanky whore. Put down the shotgun and eat, D, or it's gonna be a long night. What, are we best friends now or something? Hmm? Cop shoots a nigga every 28 hours. Does anyone know what day it is? The date... it's Wednesday the 28th. But I was told we haven't had communication for a whole day. Why would they say such a thing? - Well, that's really weird. - What... what is really weird? The old lady and I share a birthday, march the 7th. March the 7th? That's... that's my birthday. Get out. You're kidding me. That's my birthday too. When's your birthday? My birthday? March 7th, why? - Who is he? Who are you? - He's the fucking clown. How do you know he's the clown? Who wears pants like that? When's your birthday, clown? It's David. It's march 7th. March 7th? That's my birthday. March 7th is my birthday. March 7th is everyone's birthday. What are you pointing that at me for? We'd like to know your birthday. None of your fucking business. He's been drinking. He's drunk. - He was drunk on the elevator. - So? Is that a fucking crime? It's a misdemeanor, actually. Not in my fucking country, it ain't. What do you do here? In America? - I don't work a fucking circus. - I do private birthday parties. So does she, I fucking betcha. Hey, there's no need to insult her, okay? Or what? Wanna fucking fight? It's been a long, strange day. Tempers are a little short here. And why must everything be "fuck you, fuck this, fuck that"? It's a manner of fucking speaking. "It's a manner of fucking speaking." do you even have any friends? In high fucking places, ya twink. How do you even know I'm gay? You're gay as fucking Christmas. You are just a hateful human being. It's them fucking parades I hate. You know, hate speech in itself is a crime. Oh, yeah, right. Fucking murderer standing there, yet I'm the fucking criminal. I'd watch yourself there, Ireland. You know, I've always wanted to know, what's it fucking like to kill someone? You always wanted to know? Don't pretend you haven't fucking thought about it, mademoiselle. I never thought about it once. Aw, I've thought about it plenty. I'm thinking about it right now. So what's the fucking answer? I don't know what the fucking answer is. I've never killed anybody my whole fucking life. Two foul mouths in my house. Well, then why'd they put you in prison? 'Cause I'm a black man. And the prison industrial complex needs black men to feed your system. There's more niggas in prison today than there were slaves in the civil war. How long were you in prison? I've been incarcerated 13 goddamn years. You ever take one for the home team? Fuck you, motherfucking shamrock. Up the queen's bridal path. Aren't you afraid that he's gonna shoot you? Okay, okay, we're gonna shut this down. Says he's never killed anybody. I take the man at his fucking word. Oh, I didn't say I never shot a man. I'm out of here. That the way they do it in prison? Yeah. Fight like a fucking man, ya lepre-coon. Fight like a man, huh? Fight like a man? Stop it! Stop it! - Oh, my goodness. - Come on! Stop it, stop it! Just stop it! I'm tired of this. I'm sick of it. Don't any of you have families at all that you're worried about? Well, if you don't, I do. I just want this to be over. I want to know my husband and daughter are safe. I just wanna go. Someone's coming. Maybe it's help. Oh, that's Graciela's little car. Who the fuck are these guys? Anybody moves, and you're dead. Stop! I'm a police officer. I am armed, and I will shoot you. Oh, look at the chica fuerte. We don't need no unnecessary violence. Mujer, someone wanna talk with you. Graciela, come talk to Francis. Oh! Lo siento, Francis. I didn't want to come to your house. They made me. It's... it's all right, Graciela. They want numbers to the safe. Please, I don't want them to hurt you. I-I don't remember the combination. I don't even... i-i have it written down somewhere in the... in the... in the house. Well, then, go find it for us, chocha. Get in the house, now! Go! Go, go, go! Wait up! Keep going! Don't stop! Wait! Wait! Keep running! Hey. Help her! She needs help. My glasses! I can't... where are they? I can't... fuck. Fuck. I can't... i can't see a thing! Drop the fucking box and run! Fuck! Come on! - Stop! - Keep moving, keep running. - I left my purse in the house. - Forget the fucking purse. But my phone is in it. I ca... i can't see a thing. We're over here! We need help. I'm with the old woman. - Help! - What the fuck are you doing? - The old woman, she needs help. - Fuck the old woman! - Aah! - Wade! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck me! - What did you do? - I fucking broke my leg. I think I fucking snapped it! Oh, my god, are you in pain? Yes, I'm in fucking pain! - Okay, okay. - Fuck! Who's there? Bleeding black forest out here. Are you okay? Are you all right? All right? Do I fucking look all right? I'm sorry you fucking asked. Stop! - We have to stop. - I see a light over there. - We can't leave the others. - Hey, I came back. I did my part. Now it's every man for himself. Then I'm going back for them! Hey! Just... fuck! Just wait here for us. Wait right here. Fuck. Hello? Who is there? Who is that? Hey! What is it? What is it? - What is that? - What the fuck is that? Fucking hell. Oh, ew. This can't be happening. Who made this?
