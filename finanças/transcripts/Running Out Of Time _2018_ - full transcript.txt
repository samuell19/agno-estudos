[gasps] ♪♪ [shot] [woman gasping] ♪♪ [Pamela] A beautiful soul was laid to rest today as family, friends and government officials, all gathered to pay their final respects to California senator's Chief of Staff, Clarence Harper. Many spoke in high regards of Harper, with sentiments such as God-fearing, humanitarian, and an adamant fighter for equal rights. But more personally than that, he was a man of faith and honor, and deeply devoted to his family. Before being appointed to office, Harper was a long-time associate of California senator and presidential candidate, Conrad Toms. Toms suspended his campaign today to speak with us briefly on the loss of someone so vital to his administrative staff. Clarence was more than my chief of staff for the last 11 years, he was my close friend. [Toms] He meant so much to so many people. My prayers and condolences go out to his wife and his daughter. I can't imagine what they're going through. Thank you. Shock and awe is the common state of mind for all the attendees here today. [Pamela] Clarence Harper suffered a heart attack just nine days ago, at a young age of 48. [sobbing] Words cannot express the honor it was to know a man like Clarence. I could not have asked for a better friend and confidant. [sobbing] Clarence, you will deeply be missed. For KILT News, Washington DC, this is Pamela O'Dell. Back to you, Steve. ♪♪ [coughs] Are you okay, Gammy? Oh, baby... I grew up a poor black girl in the Deep South in the '50s and '60s. I've survived a lot more than this. [grandmother] It's gonna take more than a little cough to take me out. [Brenda] Just give your feet some rest, Momma, come on. Brenda. - I'll take her to the car. - Okay, honey. I am so sorry. Thanks for coming, Conrad. Wouldn't have missed it for the world. Suzy would have been here, but she's in Texas campaigning for the upcoming election and-- It's okay. I understand, just please give her my love, all right? Will do. - Anything you need. - I know. ♪♪ Thank you. [woman sobbing] - Oh, honey. Pam. Baby, please. - I'm so sorry. Hold it together, baby. I'm hanging on by a thread here. I'm so sorry, I just can't believe my program director made me cover that. Honey, Clarence would have had it no other way. You know that, right? - Hi, Cain. Thank you for coming. - I know. [Toms] Mister O'Dell! - Sir. - Hey. Look, I know how close you and Clarence were. Let's meet next week to discuss the duties you'll be inheriting as my new chief of staff. - Mighty big shoes to fill. - I won't let you down, sir. I don't suppose you will. Hey, are you making it to the burial? No, I have thing to attend to, but you take care. Watch your head, sir. Thanks, son. I don't know what I'd do without you. Yes, sir. Couldn't wait to turn the moment into a self-absorbed business as usual, right? I'm surprised he waited as long as he did. When he got up to speak, I thought he was gonna start spouting his campaign slogan. "Let's reset America." Brenda, how are you doing? I am doing okay. You know, this whole thing... [Brenda] It's just really hard to take in, you know. - Clarence was like a brother. - Yes. I know. I know. What about Kristen? She's still not talking to you? [Brenda] She lets me get a word in every once in a while. She still refuses to cry in front of me though, you know. - Yeah. - I wonder where she gets that stubbornness from. - Exactly. - Me. Guilty as charged. I am taking her to the summer home for the week, so hopefully, that'll be good for her, you know. Well, hopefully it'd be good for both of you, guys.

I thought it would be good for us to get out of the city. You know, away from all the cameras. Plus, the fresh air is good for Mom. So, I didn't get a vote? Please don't make this harder than it already is. We really need each other right now. Kris! No, baby, let her go. You know, she going to have to work all this out on her own way and in her own time. Not unlike some other teenager I used to know. [laugh] Could nobody tell you nothin'. Hmm... [Brenda] It's so beautiful out here. I love it out here. So peaceful.

Deep breath. Come on. Kris Kross. What? Can we talk? I don't really want to right now. Oh, well... You don't have a choice. [sighs] Look at this. Hmm... I haven't seen you in this room since you were a little girl. [laughs] You and Daddy would always play hide-and-seek, remember that? You would always hide under the bed, he'd pretend like he didn't know where you were, but he always knew. It looks like hide-and-go-seek is officially done being played in this house. Oh, honey, baby... I wish I could tell you it's all gonna get better soon, but I can't. I was 28 when my daddy died... and I still miss him. You know, you're gonna have some good days, you're gonna have some bad days, but after a while, your memories of him will go from giving you pain to making you smile for every time he made you happy. I yelled at him. It's okay. But guess what? I would have yelled at my daddy too if he would have been reading my diary. I just... It just made me mad how he found out about Justin. Honey, he was just an overprotective dad. You were Daddy's little girl, that's all. I know. But it wasn't even that serious. We just went on a few dates. - Are you sure that was it? - Yes, Mom. God, you know, we didn't have sex. Well then what did he read? It doesn't even matter. I still did too much when he dropped me off at school. I told him to get out of my life. And then I... I got out of the car and I slammed the door and-- That was it. I didn't even say I love you. Mom, I always say I love you. But not that day. My last words to my dad were, "Get out of my life", and I can't take it back. - Come here. Come here. - [weeping] It's okay, honey. Look at me. Look at me. Kris Kross. Daddy knew exactly how much you loved him. I mean-- I don't know that, Mom, 'cause he's not here. All I know is that I can't say I'm sorry. I should have just said, "I love you", Mom. I should have just said, "I love you." Hmm, baby. I'm gonna go make Gammy some soup. [sighs] I love you, Kris Kross. I love my Kris Kross. [laughs] [sighs] [Grandmother coughing] Here you go, Gammy. What you say, baby? I said, "Here you go." I brought you some soup and your pain meds. I know you didn't bring me any whisky with this soup, did you? Well, Gammy came prepared. Look in my bag right there, the top zipper. Hand me that bottle and my shot glass too. Ah, Gammy. You can't be getting turnt up, you're too old. Plus, you know Mom always says you can't mix whisky with your pain meds. What is this "turnt up"? [laughs] It's what we say. It's like high energy or feeling good. You know, like when you turn up music, it's like turning up your body. You know I aint into that lingo talk y'all kids into these days. You just give me some Smokey and some whisky, I'm gonna turn up all night long. - [laughs] - What's "Smokey"? The reason you're alive. - Oh, Gammy. - [laughs] That's disgusting. Oh, baby, it's so good to see you laugh, even if it's only for a second. - Gammy loves you. - I love you too. - Good night, Gammy. - Good night, baby. I love you. - Sleep well. - You too. Ooh. Hey, Momma. - [yawning] - Do you need anything? No, baby, I'm fine. Mom, how many times have I told you not to mix your whisky with your pills? Last time you did that, you slept for days! Hush up, Brenda. I'm turnt up. [laughs] You must have been talking to Kristen. Uhm. Speaking of which, did you talk to her? I talked to her a little bit. She's really sad. You know that the last words to her dad were in anger. Oh, that poor baby. Well, you know, in time she'll come to realize that it was nothing but puberty talking. Shoot, my last word to your daddy was about his gas. [laughs] I swear that man could clear out Madison Square Garden. Momma, stop talking about Daddy like that. Child, you know your daddy was a walking propane tank. - [laughs] - [coughs] That's why we never kept matches in the house. - [laughs] - You are too much, Mom. - I miss him. - Me too. Uhm. You are good? You don't need anything else? No, I was going to have you put my phone on the charger, but I think I-- No, I don't know what I'm talking about, honey. These pills and that whisky are about to put me down for the count. - [laughing] Okay. - Can you take this with you, baby? - I got you, Momma. - Wait, I'll keep that. - Just in case. - Of course, you will. - All right, baby. - Ah. - I love you. - I love you.

I did everything that you asked me to do, so could you please just let me and my family--? No! [Cain moans] [kidnapper] Let's not get excited. I'm a real trigger-happy and you're testing me now. Whatever it is you want, just please take it and go. We'll get to all that in a second. First things first. Is there anyone else in the house? No. Is that true, Mr. O'Dell? No. Her mother is upstairs. What are you doing? - I'm sorry. - [kidnapper] Tsk, tsk. The question is, Mrs. Harper, what are you doing? Because you don't know who we are or why we're here, yet you look to escalate the situation by lying to us. Not very smart. And I was led to believe by your little friend here that you were very intelligent. She's just an old lady with lung cancer and bad hearing. And she had taken a sleeping pill so she can sleep through a hurricane. [sobbing] She's no threat to you, I promise. Go check it out. If she's asleep, leave her. We don't need another variable in this situation. It's not necessary. Copy that. You see how that works, Mrs. Harper? I give the orders. You shut your mouth and listen. I have money or whatever it is you want, just, please, leave me and my family alone. [kidnapper] Sorry, ma'am, I'm giving the orders, but not calling the shots. [kidnapper] She was right, the old lady is out. I found these in the upstairs bedrooms. Are there any other phones in this house besides the landline? No. No. What do you want? Really, Mrs. Harper? You know why we're here, you should have been expecting us. [kidnapper] So, get up, come with me. You too. Watch the girl. I'm not leaving without my daughter, please. You just buried your husband, it'd be a damn shame to bury your daughter too. - Don't worry... - [weeping] - Mom! - I'll take real good care of her. Don't you dare! Leave my daughter alone! Leave her alone! Control yourself. Listen. We promise we're not gonna hurt you or your daughter as long as you comply. [weeping] Mom... It's okay, it's okay, baby. It's okay, Kris. You know, I feel sorry for you, Mrs. Harper. The loving doting wife turned widow who left her job as an elite chef to be a stay-at-home mother and support her husband's career. You know, I can't imagine all the questions that must be going through your head right now. But the short answer is, Clarence is the one that put you and your daughter in this situation. So I need everything he left you right now. I've checked your house in DC and Atlanta, and this is the last stone unturned. Everything is in the safe. [kidnapper] And where's the safe exactly. [Brenda] It's in the study. - Then, let's go. - Okay. [kidnapper] Now! - You too! Let's go. - [Cain] Okay. Okay, okay. - [Kristen] Mom! - [Brenda] Okay, baby. [weeping] Mom... [Cain] Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Both of you on the floor on your knees, now. [Cain] Okay. Where's the safe? It's right there in the cabinet. The, uh, combination is still your daughter's birthday? I'll take that as a yes. [beeping] Hmm. Oh, please. Now we're getting somewhere. Finally. The deed to your house? - [screams] - What is this, Mrs. Harper? There's money right there in the safe. Please, if you want more, I can get you more. Money? Do you think we want your money? - Where is the file? - [Brenda screams] I don't know what file you're talking about. The one that Mr. O'Dell here says you have in your possession. No, no, no. I told you... I told you that I wasn't sure. [Brenda] Okay. Are you calling me a liar, Mr. O'Dell? No... Listen, there's at least $50,000 in the safe. If you got what was in the safe at my other homes, you should have clearly over $150,000 for you and your friend. I beg you to please just take it and go. And just please, let us go because there is no file here. Shh. The boss isn't interested in your little money. What he is interested in is the file! So either you give me the file we want, or I make everybody that knows about the file disappear. - [Brenda] Oh. God. - Copy that? [Cain] I know you. - What was that? - I said I... - I said I know you. - Are you sure about that, Chief? [Cain] Yeah, you're in the Senator's security. Detail agent. Ah... Spears? Agent Spears. Well, I guess this changes things a bit now, doesn't it? We don't know who you are. My daughter still hasn't seen your face. Whatever it is that you are looking for, I promise you, I will get it. I'm just begging you to please let my daughter go, please. [weeping] Let her go. Well, looks like we've graduated from plan A to plan B. - Up. - No, please. - Now! - Okay, okay. - Okay, okay. - Okay, okay. [Cain] Okay, okay. Kristen, close your eyes, baby, close your eyes! Don't look at that man! Please, baby! Keep your head down, don't look at that man! [Brenda] Don't look at his face, Kristen. Mr. O'Dell's a very smart man, but he did something pretty stupid, he made me. Well, I guess plan B's a go. What is plan B? Well, I guarantee you won't like plan B. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. [whispers] Get it. [grunts] [Brenda] Stay back! [Brenda] Put him down! I swear I will put a bullet right between your eyes! [Spears] Whoo! Heard you were a tough one, Mrs. Harper. But right now, you have a couple choices to make. Option one, you shoot me, he's gonna gut you like a fish. Option two, you shoot him, I kill you. No, better yet, I kill her. - [Brenda] Stop! - [Kristen weeps] You give us the gun, we walk away and act like nothing happened and we continue on with our business here. So what's it gonna be? Option one, option two or option three? Stay back. [Kristen] Mom, do it! Do it, Mom! - [pulling the trigger] - [Kristen screams] Mom! - Mom... - [Brenda screams] [Kristen] Mom! [crying] Mom... - [screams] - [crying] Mom! Wow. [Spears] Ballsy move, Mrs. Harper. But you know something? We never use live rounds unless it's absolutely necessary. Just so you can see for yourself. So... [loads gun] How about I try my trigger on her? No, no, please, don't touch my baby. Please, I'll give you whatever you want. I promise, I'll give you whatever you want. [Spears] To the basement. - [Brenda] Okay. - [Kristen] No, no. [Brenda] Okay, okay. [Brenda] Okay. [Kristen weeps] Move. - Mom. - In the back. Hands on the rail. [holsters the gun] On your knees. [Kristen weeps] [gasps] I'm so sorry, Brenda. I'm so sorry. I never wanted to bring this to your doorstep. What is going on, Cain? They got Pam. [Cain] Pam was waiting for us when we got home from the funeral. [sobbing] I didn't see it coming. When they knocked me out, the next thing you know I woke up in the back of a van. [Cain gasps] Congratulations on your appointment, Mr. O'Dell. We just have a few more questions for you. [Trent] And you better have more than a few answers. [moans] They tore apart our home, and then when they was done, they made us bring them here and they ransack your place too. Hm. Where's Pam now? She's out there, still tied up in the back of the van. [Pamela cries] [cries] [crying] No, no. [Pamela] No! Let go of me. [Cain] There's one more of 'em out there too. I don't know. But I think he's the one calling the shots. [Cain] Whoever he is, he's out there with her. Son of the bitch threatened to kill her and my boys if I didn't bring them to you. You got to know I would've never brought 'em to your house otherwise, Brenda. [sighs] What do they want? They want the evidence. What evidence? Clarence never told you what he found out about Senator Toms? - No, no. - [sighs] I should have known. I should have known protecting you guys was always gonna be his first priority. He never wanted you in harm's way, you or Kristen. Even if that meant keeping everything a secret. [telephone ringing and keyboard typing sound] [telephone ringing and keyboard typing sound] [Cain] Three years ago, Clarence, he stumbled on a few dummy offshore accounts. Apparently, Toms and a few others had been siphoning money from the state budget to fund extracurricular activities and then disguising it as State development projects. What is going on? Just tell me what the-- This is what I told you. You got to go to the police with this. - Are you serious? - You have to. [Cain] I told him to go to the police, but what do you do when you find out that the police Commissioner's name was on the top of the list too? The more he dug, the more he found out. He has deals with private prisons all around the state. He gets kickbacks for every prison that he keeps full. Yeah. They decide to funnel guns and drugs into minority communities through backdoor channels. And they turn around, they arrest the same people that they sell the contraband to, and then they confiscate the drugs and they confiscate the narcotics, they confiscate the money and they do it all over again. Sons of bitches are making millions of dollars on both ends of the deal. And then to top it all off, Clarence discovered that Toms wasn't just making money to take a few lavish trips. Mm-mm. He was funding his campaign. He paid to rig the election and secure a victory. Oh. Did-- What did-- what did Clarence do? The last time we talked about it was three or four months ago, he said he didn't want to put you guys at risk. So he told me that he got rid of the file, and we both said that that was going to be for the best. - Did you tell them that? - Yeah, I told them that. - Oh. - I told them-- I told them that repeatedly. But they said that they had intel that proved otherwise. These people know things about us that they shouldn't. They knew that my kids were gonna be at my parent's house for the weekend. They knew alarm codes, they knew e-mail passwords. Hell, they had our daily schedule for the last month. They are efficient, they are focused, they are unrelenting. And they won't stop. We either give them the file, or we are all dead. - I don't know what file. - You've got to think, Brenda. - I don't know, Cain. - Is there any place else that he would've kept it? A desk drawer? A top of a closet? A filing cabinet somewhere. Anywhere? - Somewhere that you didn't know about? - No. Brenda, think, please, think. - Anywhere-- - No, no! So what are we gonna do? We survive. Mr. O'Dell... Mrs. Harper... there's someone here to see you. [Cain] God... [Spears] Let's go. [Kristen gasps] - [Kristen] Mom... - I'll be back. You be a good girl now, you hear? [gasps] [Cain] Okay, okay. - Okay... Pam! Pam! - [muffled screams] [muffled screams] No! Okay, okay. [Cain] Shh, it's okay. [Pamela cries] Ah... [Spears] See, I'm a very patient man. For some reason, I get the feeling that one of you is still hiding something from me. - [Brenda] No, please. - [Spears] See... my associate here, he thinks I'm taking it way too easy on you guys. Just way too easy. He's a little twisted in the head, I get that. But maybe he's got a point. [cries] So I've decided to reconsider my stance. - [gunshot] - [Cain] No! - No! No! - [Brenda] No! [screams] No! - [Brenda] Pam! - [Cain] No! No! - I'll kill you, son of a bitch! - Pam... Okay, that's enough! [Brenda] You've made your point. Did I? No, I don't think I have. You see, you really should have been grateful that we took care of them for you because looked like to me they were gonna run away on you. What is this? - [Cain cries] - What is this? No, this is a lie. This is a lie. Clarence would never do this. Are your eyes lying to me, Mrs. Harper? Because it feels like I knew your husband better than you did. But you knew. Didn't you, Mr. O'Dell? [Cain cries] She was my wife! What-- What did you say? [Spears] About what? You said you took care of them? Ah... Yes. In the early '70s, the CIA developed a weapon that would fire a tiny frozen dart into the human body, leaving only a speck of blood at the entry point. Once inside the body, the dart would melt, releasing a neurotoxic chemical derived from the liver of a Japanese blowfish, causing the subject to fall into an immediate myocardial infarction. A heart attack. Once inside the blood stream, the poison would evaporate, leaving absolutely no evidence it was ever even there. Now, methods have certainly improved since the '70s, and you no longer need a weapon to insert the toxin. You just need to get close enough... to make one tiny little prick. - [Brenda weeps] - [Cain] I'll kill you... I'll kill you. Let go! I'll kill you. - I'll kill you. I'll kill you. - Cain, no, leave it. All right! Enough with the theatrics. We're gonna talk about plan B. You see this drive? It's loaded with information on you, Mrs. Harper. More or less from you actually. You see, it's filled to the brim with a digital fabricated footprint of yours from the past year that you've taken the courtesy to create. See, everything from e-mails, blogs, Google searches, books purchased, all talking about your history of anxiety... depression... and suicidal thoughts. I don't have suicidal thoughts. Oh, I know, I know. But, when the police investigators show up to the crime scene and see your dead family all over the ground, next to your body with a single bullet wound to the temple, and your fingerprints all over the murder weapon, they'll easily conclude that poor little Brenda Harper, already losing her battle with depression and the sudden death of her husband, just snapped. Decided to take her whole family down with her in a tragic case of... murder suicide. No one will ever believe that. [Spears laughs] Don't you watch the news, Mrs. Harper? I mean, this sort of thing happens every day. People love this stuff. They love a good horror story. So... Here's what's gonna happen next. You're either gonna give me the file, or I'm gonna upload this drive, kill everyone... and make you look like a monster to the rest of the world. [weeping] [Spears] Mister O'Dell, just in case you were thinking of uh, giving up... just remember you still have a lot to lose. [weeps] [Kristen weeps] [Kristen] What's going on? Is Gammy okay? Yes, baby, she's okay, baby. Well, what's happening? Are we gonna die? We're not gonna die. - Are we gonna die? - No, no, no. We're not dying. Cain, can you get out of here? I can't get it. They tied army knots. We need to find something sharp like scissors or-- I don't know. Kristen, you've got a nail right there, baby. Use the nail to cut the rope. Come on, baby, can you do it? Ah? You think you got it? - [Cain] Shh. - [Brenda] Okay. [Brenda whispering] Come on, baby, go, go, you got it. You got it, keep going. Keep going, you got it, baby. - [Kristen] Yes! Got it! - [Brenda] Shh. Oh, baby. Hurry up, come on. Okay, baby, take my rope off now. I got it. [Brenda] Yes. All right. - Okay, you got it? - Yeah. Okay. [thump] Okay, hurry up. Ah! Okay. I got to get Cain's. [Brenda] I need you to go upstairs, get Grammy's phone and call the police, okay? No, Mom, you're coming with me-- Shh. No, no. Cain and I, we need to distract them. Mom, I can't do this without you. Yes, you can! Please, honey. - [thumps] - Shh. This is bullshit! What is? I'm gonna go kill the little girl. The mother will talk. Trent, not a part of the plan. I don't care about your boss' agenda, I'm here for the paycheck. - You got it, baby. - Okay. - Can I use the front door? - You can't use the front door. Because there are people out there. I don't want to chance you getting caught, baby. - Just follow my plan, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Okay. All right. Are you okay, baby? - Come here, come here. - They just shot her. [Cain] Hey! [Cain] We know where the file is. Go, go. Hey! [Cain] Hey! We're ready to talk. Come on down, man! We know where the file is! [Cain] Hey! [Trent] What the hell? [Spears] Where are they? - Hey! - [Brenda] Run! - [Spears] Hey! Hey! - Run! Run! [Spears] Open the door, Mrs. Harper! Open the door or Mr. O'Dell dies! All right. - Get the girl! - [Brenda screams] [dials phone] [operator] 911. What's your emergency? [whispering] Please, help us. We're at 7437 Park Road, we're being held. - [phones turns off] - Hello? Hello? Damn it! The battery! [Spears] You found her yet? Negative! Maybe she didn't make it up this far. Check the first floor! [wood creaks] [Kristen screams] [screams] Let go of me! Let go of me! [Kristen screaming] No! No! - I got her. - Let go of me! [screaming] Ah! [Spears sighs] Hmm... You two have become too much of a liability. - [Trent] Do it, man! Waste her! - [Brenda] No, no. I know where the file is, I know where the file is. - I know where the file is. - [Spears] What? I know where the file is. I know where it's at. - [Spears] I'm listening. - I know where it's at. - [Brenda] It's-- - [doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] Shh. You make another sound, I will slit your throat. [doorbell ringing] [Spears] Get up. Get up. [doorbell ringing] It's the police. Get rid of them. - Good morning, ma'am. - Hi. Ah... Yes, it is morning, but if you were in my shoes, I don't think you'd find it too good, when you're woken up at 4 a.m. Ma'am, we were in the neighborhood, and we received a suspicious call from someone in the residence, asking for help. Oh, yeah, that must have been my daughter. She called, but everything is fine now, thank you. May we speak to her? - Who? - Your daughter. Uhm, she... she already left. She left with some friends just before you guys got here. Ma'am, can we step in for a moment? I'm sorry, I'd rather not. I plan on going back to bed as soon as we are done here. If you don't mind. What happened to your hand? - What? - Your hand. It's wrapped. What happened to it? [Trent] No, no, no. This ain't good. No. This ain't good. No, no, no. I'm not going back to jail. Never again. Not going back. No, not for you, not for them, not for anyone. This must have been why my daughter called. I slipped and fell with a glass in my hand and she thought I needed stiches, but I wrapped it. So... - everything is fine-- - Why were you drinking? - Excuse me? - Why were you dinking? What was the occasion? Were you celebrating something? - I'll kill them all. - [Cain] No, no. No, no. Sir, you don't have to kill anybody. You don't have to kill her. We'll give you whatever you want. Just tie her up. Tie her back up like she was. Shut up or I'll kill her. Well, if you must know, my... I buried my husband yesterday. We bought this summer home about ten years ago, and today was the first day that I... I spent without him, so... [sighs] A couple of bottes of Merlot kept me company, you know. Sorry to hear that, ma'am. [Grandmother coughing] Bre? [Grandmother coughing] Bre? Baby, I thought I heard a noise. Mom, everything is fine, okay? I'll be up in a second. - What's going on? - [Brenda] Everything is fine. I need you to go back to bed, please. [Brenda] All right, listen, I'm sorry but I've got to get back to my mom, she's sick. Are we done here? We can see you have your hands full, ma'am. You have yourself a good night or try to have a better morning. Sorry to disturb you. And get that hand checked when you can. [policeman] Thank you. - [grandmother] Bre? - Mom, listen. - The police? - I need you to get back to bed. - Everything is fine. - Why? What is going on? Mom! I need you to go back to bed, please. - [Kristen] Gammy! Gammy! - My baby! [Spears] No, no. You, go sit down over there. - [Grandmother] No. - Come on. [Grandmother] No! [Spears] Sit down. [Spears] Jesus Christ. What's going on up there? Ah, nothin', was just a couple of cops. They're gone, don't worry about it. Are you sure? [Brenda] You guys, you don't have to do this. I thought you said you didn't want to involve anyone else. This is not good, man. No, no. I want to get out of here. This is not good. [Spears] Trent, relax, they're gone. [Brenda] Please, don't do this. Just let my mother and my daughter go, I will get you the file. How are you gonna get me the file? My husband's attorney, he called and said that... I have a package here for you. From Clarence. Package? Continue. [Brenda] Really? Was it in his will? I guess he forgot to add it in there. It has to be it. It has to be it. We can go to his lawyer's office and get it in a couple of hours once they open up. She's making this up. Look, I say we waste them both right now, get the hell out of here. Who's to say those cops aren't out there right now running the plates on that van, they're coming back here with about a hundred of their friends. Now, are you ready for that? 'Cause I'm not. What if she's telling the truth? [Trent] No, no, no, no. She's not right. Oh, some sort of mysterious package just shows up? She's stalling. [Brenda] No! It's not. I just-- With everything that's been going on, it just slipped my mind. Please. Tell me you don't believe in this. Maybe I am. See, look. Let me break it down for you. If we kill them right now, we lose everything. But, if that is the file, we win. We get everything we were promised. Mission accomplished. [Spears] But see, my friend here, he's got a very valid point. You're running out of time. Mrs. Shaw, correct? 25257 South Bonita Street? Yes. Good. So... What do you think I should do? Mister, I have known demons and serpents like you my whole life, you're nothing but bullies and trash that use their position or their social status to intimidate and harm people that you just have decided are beneath you. Well, I got news for you. As for me and mine, you are nothing to us but a bruise on our heels. So you want to know what I think, I'll tell you. I think you... should go to hell! - [Kristen] Gammy! - Mom! [Brenda screams] That's for my family! [gasps] Now, would you rather see your whole family dead? [moaning] No. Good answer. [Spears] See, as long as I have your family, I call the shots. [Trent] You said this was an in and out. We come in, grab the files, erase all traces and go. Worst case, we kill them and leave no witnesses. You said nothing about cops! Now, you need to finish them all. Or I will. - [Brenda] No! - [Spears] Trent, no. - [Spears] Put the gun down. - [Brenda] What is he doing? - Holster that gun, Marine. - [Trent] No, no, no. I'm not going to jail. Not for you, not for her, not for anyone. Never again. This mission is over. If you kill her, you lose. No, no, no. See, I don't lose. I still have my freedom, so I don't lose. No. I'm ending this mission now. - [Spears] No! - [Brenda screams] Holster that weapon. Now! You're threatening me over this? Over them? You're leaving me no choice here. You blue falcon, son of a bitch. Stand down, Marine. That's an order. We can still walk away and win. I'm not going back to jail. Not for you. Screw it. You do what you have to do. - [Spears] No, wait, wait! - [Brenda] No! [gunshot] [Brenda weeps] Oh! Really? Yes, really. Do you remember when you told me that you can control this lunatic? - I had him. - You didn't have anything. That was not control. You think I want to be doing this? You didn't have to kill the guy. Yes, I did. And now you got to clean this up because he is not supposed to be here. [Spears groans] No. No, Cain. Hey, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. [Spears] All right. I've got the chemicals in the van, there's a cast iron tub upstairs. [Cain] That's good. Good. So, uh, what about this one? You want me to kill her now? [Toms] As my new chief of staff. - Mighty big shoes to fill. - Oh, I won't let you down, sir. [Cain] There's one more of them out there too. I don't know. [Cain] Hey, listen up. If I feel like things are moving too slow, I'm gonna look at you and I'm gonna say, "Hey, I think recognize you." That is your cue to kill her. - [Cain] You understand? - I do. - You got it? - [Trent] Copy that. Let's go. [muffled gunshot] No, because her and I have a little field trip to take. Don't we, Bre? So get up. Got to get you cleaned up. Can't have you going to see Jerry looking the mess. Let's go. [Cain] Come on. Don't be scared. [Spears] You want me to start on this one, sir? No. I don't want you to get started on him. Listen, you know what I want you do to? I want you to tie her-- Actually I want you to zip tie her ass, all right? And we can't have her getting loose once she wakes up and then you dispose of him. How long will it take for his body to dissolve? - About four hours, sir. - Okay. That's good. That gives us enough time to get in to town and get back. Yo, time to go. We got to move. We got to move. - Get up. Get-- - Ah! Stop. Brenda, I said get your ass up. - Oh! Fine. - Get your ass up. And move! Hey, hey. Sir, what about granny here? Ah... Just take her back up to her room. She won't remember anything. We'll be gone by the time she wakes up. Let's go. Brenda, Brenda, I will blow your brains out. Do you understand me? Now let's go. [Brenda grunts] Brenda, you got one more time to jerk away from me. Pam loved you. Pam only loved herself and her career. You know, she was screwing her boss. And anybody else she needed to get what Pam wanted. You destroyed all of our lives just to be Toms' little toy? I hope the money he's paying you is worth it. How could you do that? Toms is a greedy, oblivious, idiot, that doesn't know his ass from a hole in the wall. I'm not doing this for him. Get some clothes. And could you grab me one of Clarence's shirts, please? Thank you. Go. - Who are you doing this for? - Who am I doing it for? I am doing it for me. Brenda, Toms rigged the election, Bre. He's about to be elected to President. With all the information in that file, he will have to make me his VP candidate. He wins, he serves two terms, and in eight years, just eight years, I will have the Oval. That's worth more than any amount of money. That's real power. [Cain] Sometimes you got to see the bigger picture. What is going on? Just tell me what the-- This is what I told you. Okay. You know, sit down, please. No, we need to take this to the authorities. Just have a seat. Come on, please. Clarence, let's not be stupid here, okay? Do you know what this could do for us? - Are you serious? - Oh, I'm very serious. I mean, you got-- you got bank statement, documentation. Look at this. I can't believe-- Clarence. - I'm going to the authorities. - Clarence. [Cain] See, before that point, I thought Clarence and I, we had the same aspirations. But I realized at that very moment that we did not. See, Clarence was okay with mediocrity. But me, I wasn't. I wanted more, and that file was gonna be how I get it. You killed him? [Clarence] Yeah, good meeting today. That was great meeting today, man. Good points got brought up, you know. - Yeah, yeah, I do want that. - Yeah. So tonight, I was thinking-- Ah, ah, ah. Hey, hey, no, no. No, don't fight it. Don't fight. Don't fight it. Don't fight it. Don't fight it. Shh. All you had to so was listen. That was it. All you had to so was listen. But you couldn't do it, Clarence. So now this is it. Just let it go. Help! Help! Please! Somebody! [Cain] I did what I had to do. So... now you know why I need the file. I hope you burn in hell. Maybe I will, but until then, let's get some makeup on those scars. [Cain blows a kiss] Pam and Clarence never had an affair, did they? No. But worse, they confided in one other. See, once Clarence discovered that most of the state's top brass, they was involved in the schemes, he panicked. [Cain] Didn't know who he could trust. He didn't know who was in Toms' pocket. So, he decides to do the next best thing, and leak the info to the press. Pam agreed to help him. She also agreed to keep it from me. And that was the mistake on both their parts. She was gonna turn us both in. And once I realized I couldn't trust her, she had to go. She was a unfortunate, but very necessary casualty in all of this. See, Clarence was smart enough not to involve you. And that's what we are too, aren't we? Unfortunate but necessary casualties in your little grab for power. Brenda, Brenda, Brenda. Clarence, he had to complicate things. He didn't leave the file in his office. He didn't leave it at his house. This was the last place I could think to look. So, here we are. [clears his throat] You two done yet? I got to get started on Trent. Phew. [clicks tongue] And what are you getting out of this? You see, when, uh, Cain here becomes President, I'll become the chief of staff. It's a cheap price to pay for true political power. Why should I trust that if I give you the file, you won't just kill us anyway? I guess you're just gonna have to see. But I tell you what, you give me what I need, and I promise that you, your mother, and your daughter, you'll live. Hell, I will even drive you to the nearest police station because you're gonna walk in there-- and this is the best part, you're gonna confess to killing my wife in a momentary fit of insanity. [Spears] Phew. [Spears claps] Hmm. - What? - Yeah. See, after you give me the file, I'm gonna call Agent Spears here, and I'm gonna tell him to let your mother and your daughter go and he'll gladly do so, after which he will upload to the USB disk all of your crazy history and then you're gonna confess to the killings and happily go to jail for the crimes. And after you do that, I promise you that your mother and your daughter, they'll be fine. I won't harm one hair on their head, nor will I send anybody in my place to do so. That's crazy. No. See, Brenda, it's just your life for theirs. This way everybody gets what they want. You get to ensure your family's safety, and we get that file. It's not gonna work. - No? - It's not gonna work. - You don't think that's gonna work? - No, it's not. Because Kristen's already seen his face. It's true. But see, I believe that you can convince your impressionably young daughter to keep her mouth shut. And if she's as smart as I know she is, she'll get in line, learn to enjoy her new life with her grandma. So, what's it gonna be? Hmm? Do we all win... or do we all lose? Get dressed. ♪♪ [Brenda] I can't believe you. [Cain] Oh, you can't believe? Why can't you believe it? Brenda, again, sometimes you have to see the bigger picture.
