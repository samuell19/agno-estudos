This fact, combined with the type of diet, the daily exercise and the ... " ... the freedom of living ..." ... strengthens the forces and brings forth people of immense size. " I wish you all the best. And I hope we will meet after the summer vacation to be seen again in full. Ade. That's very clear. because the Americans are now playing "Lili Marleen" , it is contaminated by Jews and is removed from the list. - bullshit. That's because of the sex. "Both of our shadows looked like one ..." What does that have to do with sex? Yes, guys, they do it standing up! What do you think The two shadows merge that is a clear metaphor. - Colossal! A Fairwell fuck ... What is it now? Are we going to the x-ray? Secure. What's in it? Now open your mouth and tell what you told me - Yes! But you have to promise not to say anything. What's that about? - Now you swear. All. And now it also applies. - Now open your mouth! So this x-ray is not an x-ray. This is a draft for the Waffen SS. Whoever goes in there has to sign for the SS. Where do you want to get that from? My father had an Obersturmbannführer yesterday treated the root of the tooth. He told him that. But in the greatest secrecy. So what do we do now? What should happen? Waffen-SS is voluntary. Are you stupid? They need cannon fodder. Voluntary sucks. - We can't pinch! Wanna hold your head on a lost cause # In front of the barracks in front of the big gate # there was a lantern and it is still in front of it. # So we want to see each other again. # We want to stand by the lantern. # Like Lili Marleen once did. # Like Lili Marleen once did. # Like Lili Marleen once did. # Our two shadows looked like one. # That we loved each other so much could be seen straight away. # And all people should see # when we stand by the lantern. # Like Lili Marleen once did. # Like Lili Marleen once did. Crap. Perfect Lightning, and she didn't even look. Does not matter. The main thing is that we jumped. Guys ... There is something in the bush. " A cowardly attack was carried out on the Fuehrer today." "With the aim of getting power into your hands of traitors and Jews to bring. " "However, the Führer is in good health and personally leads the measures, which brought the uprising to a standstill ... " - Maybe it wasn't in vain. Hitler is said to be seriously injured. And if so. Don't you want it to be over at last? Nobody asked me. I ask you. What if we lose the war? Good night, father. Open up, Feldgendarmerie! Open up! Yeah? They wish? Is your son here? Yes, of couse. You, come down! Zack, zack! Why? - Your son yesterday an official screening date withdrawn. We are coming now. Here. You! Up! To attract! March, March! Beautiful Broke, huh? Because of the attack. Now all the crazy play. The not a scratch on it. Remember, Waffen-SS volunteer, no one can force us. And if it is? You're too small for the SS. We will keep an eye on you. All or none. I promise. I Promise. I promise. I promise. go, go, go! Faster, you slackers! Cowards! Faster, faster, faster! I thought, this is voluntary. Attitude! Take off everything. But not quite all, is it? Inhibitions? We are starting to get used to you. Take off on three. One. Two. Three. Scum together, all of you. Press, you may want to from the service to the weapon. The Leader, need you in this hour, home your comrades leave her in the lurch. Washcloth you guys! Of the 27 and 28, the vintages. But your 29er ... A mess you are! This is your last Chance. Who's a guy, in the Waffen-SS. The exception certificates you can forget it. The leaders want you with us! Fight A Value Of Zero. But that will change. We will prevail, because we need to win! Need to have the other the don't you? Size? 17,3. So extended, wa? Thanks a lot. Size? 1,79. I volunteer the air force reported. Anyone else think he shakes loose on the SS? I'll tell you what, my Boy. We have no aircraft, but the air force has no Fuel. The decision falls to the ground. And where we are, the opponent makes the most of the blood. And who shirks from in my eyes a deserter. So, now you're going back again and make up your mind exactly what happens to deserters. The not all the day long. Wait and see. Everything is completed, we squat grandiose of the event. GSH, GSH! Peace! Compete! Go on! ... Carry On, Carry On! Excuse Me, Mr Untersturmführer, but I don't have the minimum size for the Waffen SS. For you, the leader makes an exception because you volunteer. The only reason why we you would take, would be, if your family Jewish would be contaminated. But you'll probably don't want to make, or? Shit! What now? We have promised him, wa? Without a signature, we get anyway, not out. I was going to report me. On a voluntary basis. All in the next shelter! Come on, hurry, hurry! Faster! Who knows maybe the documents are in the attack, lost. So what happens. don't be ridiculous! Me at the wrap! This is not said. A forced signature is not valid. You're one to talk out of it you're fine. All of you. Then we report it to us all. A matter of honor. I need yet my close combat clasp. Are you stupid? So much guys for once! I'll take care of him. - This is not fair. When was the last Time, what is fair? When my house was bombed and my Old plan to go to? Meet you can smoke it in a pipe. Happiness is what counts. Can be that the documents spills are gone! The pattern is four weeks! - Wait. Shit goes by, is just thicker. Maybe, anyway soon over. Yesterday I heard the BBC. The Front is collapsing everywhere. It is over, if the leader says. You actually care about anything? The life-and-so? If you do this to me directly to ask me ... Life can specifically do to me ass licking. Only I'm the life don't give a shit. You're also Scared, that caught you! I can also with the Lightning to catch. The Sky Is The Lord God Bag, Knuffke ... - Shut up. We are not boy scouts! Lightning Deluxe on three, okay? One ... - And then? How? - Will you stay in the water? I mean, she smiled at me the course. You're dreaming! The he looked at me. You think just because she's cross-eyed. Shit. # Today I was at the Frieda ... One, two, three. # Because of the Frieda was never there. # She has such a fine ... # ... A two-room apartment all to yourself. # In your eyes she has such a Good thing. # If you want to have of her she's doing it. # Drum I go to the Frieda # always, again and again. How was that? We have no planes, but the air force out of Gas? In any case, have the to a lot of time. That's for sure. And, therefore, bestowed upon you the honor of as a Hitler youth in your post to contribute to the final victory. You will support our heroic Soldiers on the Western front against the Judeo-plutocratic Conspirators. Straight in this Moment of attack against the West wall, our Holy Rhine to seize. Doesn't sound good. If you's to make Holy, shit is due. Is still better to as the Waffen-SS. I told you. You forget. Lore ... Remains. Guys, we go to Paradise! Now the shit out of this imagine! Wives fed up, because the men all at the Front. Then the danger from the enemy. The power gefühlig. Because you can always in a woman's hide. At least partially ... - Better to be a virgin and the life. Who says I'm still a virgin, huh? The hollow of your Hand doesn't count but, Tongue. Heavy Artillery. But they said, the Front is far away. Yes, of course, and we are on the brink of final victory. Pants! Way! everybody take cover! Under the train! Pants, here! We can do this. Think of the Lore. What a fucking mess, get up! Immediately man get up! - I can't. It is the belly. Since when do you need the belly to Stand! Come on, Boy! This is a command! - He has The shits, but nothing in the stomach. Because of the small rations. He needs to see a doctor. Oh, the food suit the young men do not. Yes, you think, your are here Camps, while the comrades the mother soil with their blood to defend it? Or ... saboteurs are? Ha, do you want to be court-martialled,? With All Due Respect, Mr. Special, we are concerned only to the trenches. They are important for the final victory. For this we need all of our power. The run always full with water. Oh, Water. Then you need to dig deeper! But then, that's even more full. The groundwater is too high. Do you doubt about on command of the leader, huh? The leader commanded, we dig here. So we dig here! Or do you think you're smarter than the leader? In no case, Mr Special. But this is physics. Where is the officer in charge? Where were they from? Is your squad a bunch of pigs is! I was a leak, Mr Special. And as for the boys, that may be, but you still have. In the trenches no Landser is clean that are too close to the river. Tell me, are here all the ... This is defeatism! I'll get you court-martialed! No, Mr. Special, this is realism. But we dig further, guys. The leader knows what he's doing. He probably wants the French in the trenches drown. I suggest we forget the Whole thing now. And the boys get a special ration. You'll regret it. Go on! How did you do that now? I know who is the idiot goes to bed. With whom? - Because you need to yourself come, if you have the guts. Now, we will dig further for the final victory. Maybe we can catch Yes even a fish. Shit close. Closer than yesterday. - As.

"at a time in the enemy powers from all sides against Germany attack, the German state leadership has to further action of the total war commitment determined." "By Merging the daily press is and magazine press restricted." "In all the German barracks and garrisons on the doors, the volunteer boys as well as the use in war of Economy and armor shared to receive as recruits. The step in a life, nothing more with your previous to do, to start." "From the invasion front!" "This is the enemy in the coming weeks and months feel."

How do you know? - From the Ulla. The dance here in the Club. She told me earlier. Unfortunately, you don't know, who the Losers were. The dances here in the shed? Sure. This is a friend of the Gunda. I wanted you later imagine. Tell me once, Knuffke ... What are you doing with the poles for business? I don't know what you mean. Knuffke, I saw you, in Poland stock. How you get the stuff measure the truck unloaded did. How come the McKee trust you? He does not do at all. But he needs me. In addition, I know a few things about him. What things? - Listen to me, you're my friend. So I say, stay out of this, this is not for you. Why? You think I'm too soft? I've also experienced the war, it's not just you! You're still, you know? In there. As you heal. How do you know? Because you're my friend, you coffers. That's why I don't want you're a Gangster. And you? For me it is no matter. I'm lost, eh, wa? I look to the Ulla. I need to talk to you. But not on the road. I don't have a lot of time. It's about Charlie. Charlie? - Knuffke, Man! What is? He is in trouble, but he does not know it. No, he didn't want to know. Because of your business? - No questions, just listen! He must get away from here, as soon as possible. I keep on trying, it is clear to him- but he doesn't get it. I'm scared, that something happens to him. You love him? Yes. No. But. But ... it's complicated. He builds constantly castles in the air for us, in South America, Africa. And to get money, he's doing stuff with people ... My God, he is but ... half a child, still. No, the Knuffke know what he's doing. You have no idea. - Yes. I've seen you. In Poland Stock. You, the McKee and Knuffke. Knuffke has something against McKee in the Hand. Is it true? Stop asking questions. You're his friend. The only one he has, he says. If this is so, then you have to do something. Why? I don't even know what's going on. Either you tell me what's going on, or you can go back. Each week, auxiliary supplies for the former forced labourers and concentration camp prisoners, on their departure to Canada to wait. Charlie and McKee branches of large parts and sell them on the black market. This was Charlie's and my idea. McKee came later. Charlie thinks he has a grip on him. But he is with the life to pay if none is present. You're stealing from so your own people and do with McKee and with Knuffke rum. Who knows who else. Why should I trust you? You're nothing more than ... What? A Whore? You little hypocrite Brats. Yes. I'm a whore. More than you in your little German brain can imagine. Or, you know, how it was done in the East? The border area. Where you alternately Pole, People of German, again Pollack and then again prey to German were. Do you know that? McKee has been my salvation. Charlie understood. And I will forget him, never. Your friend loves me. But this will kill him. Against McKee, he has no Chance. What should I do? Do you honestly think that he listens to me? For the I'm a shit! Something would have to happen. Something me in Charlie's eyes worthless. Then he would stop spinning, take his money and ... go. To me, he would never believe it. But if you tell him, then. We don't have to do it Yes really. He must just believe. You're crazy! Complete! Why don't you just Bang with Knuffke? You don't understand it, or? McKee will never allow I'm going. He is not a man, the you take away something. With me ... Charlie has no Chance. He has to stop loving me. This is bullshit. Tell him, I seduced you. His best friend. Then he will give up on me. He'd never believe me. You love him too! It doesn't matter to me. Stop it! Please. What the hell is going on? You were moaning in your sleep. Nothing. Everything is okay. I know you loved her. When do you mean? The Lore. We were just sharp to you, but you loved her. Nonsense, I was much too young for the. Do you think then the love will ask? I wish you a girl, you can love, where everything is just right, the one as the other. You're one of these? The Gunda? That's what you smelled, wa? And what's with the McKee? You don't want any more. You want me. And I want you. In here, I know. It is just difficult in a country, the lost. The is one of the winners, wa. Can make with us, what he wants. But the maybe change. How? You know, what has been said of old, Konrad? "Knowledge is Power." And what do you know about it? Knuffke, I need to tell you something. You're my friend? Yes, of course. Then just wish me luck. On three. One ... Two ... - Knuffke, I uh ... Three. You Coward! Why didn't you tell him? I thought, you're his friend! I can't do this! Love you skin and hair! This is crazy, I'm too old! Nonsense! Thereafter, the love doesn't ask! This will kill him. No ... Not if you run away with him. I can't. Ah, I know ... You're the one that's cowardly. You don't dare, to go with him. But without him, you can't be. get your Shit alone! Excuse me, have you the Charlie seen? The one with the eye patch. Via all the mountains. Without saying a word. Comrades, pig, I've always said. Does as if he would be Better, but it is also just a Blender. And his Old one is never his Old, I'll bet you anything my ass. Come on. Then we make the Lightning. Can't be that hard. You're finally here. Where were you the whole time! Why? What is Special? Well, I've been looking for you everywhere! I was on the road a lot. We want to go to the Shack? It is getting cold out here. Also, I don't have much time. I get something to Drink. How's the Gunda? Modest. The spinning again. Why? Just like that. Talking stupid stuff, sees ghosts. What kind of ghosts? You kill me. Who is it? No Idea. I say Yes, she's crazy. I have no enemies in the commercial, 'm honest, keep me on the Deals. And ... what is with the McKee? How? What of him? That's not always good with Gunda, you and the. Nah. Should's not. You, I've got a great thing on the Run, if it works, then we are gone, the Gunda and I. If he lets you. He must be Young. Otherwise it is off. How, what, otherwise, was he? Can you shut up? Of course you can, are Yes my buddy. So, pass on: The Sow makes shops the former agent of the Gestapo. Buy the a white vest with Gold jewelry and what are you so in the war have bags. And, if that is blown, then he is due. Smell, wa? How do you know? - You know, wa? The Captain would like to know that too. As long as he does not know who the know he can't touch me. Therefore, the Gunda are and I will soon be gone. I no longer go to the Penne, Young.
