The So-called Caryatids On the street, a nude is more often in bronze than alive... in stone than in the flesh. We aren't surprised by unclad ladies... lighting sidewalks or buildings gracefully and lasciviously. More than sexy flower-ladies and pale or bronzed sirens... I like the statues, human columns... bearers of doors, lintels, capitals or balconies... the so-called caryatids. The architect Vitruvius tells of their origin. The Peloponesian city of Karyate aided... Persia in a war against other Greeks. But Persia lost. The Greeks took revenge on Karyatian collaborators... slaying all the men and enslaving the women. They were paraded as spoils of war. The noble women were triumphantly shown... in their lovely gowns and finery. To illustrate their punishment... architects used... these statues on public buildings instead of columns. The incident faded away. But caryatids were born. Here we'll only see Parisian ones... of the late 19th century. They go by twos, covered or nude... often one half-naked, the other not! They're symmetrical but never identical. Except on Avenue de Tourville where there is a mixed couple... Paris has a dozen twin-like males... and about 50 twin-like females. It takes triplets to handle the heavy facade of a big bank. The 4 lady-columns have become 12. He bears this building alone, single-handed. Male caryatids are atlases... in memory of Atlas carrying the world. Pa's the strongest and Ma's the prettiest... The statues say so too. The men are strong and muscular. So we must see the muscles... and the strain... and the facial tension. The atlas expresses force and power. Women usually bear loads casually on their heads. A woman with a head-basket... is a calm piece of sculpture. I've photographed them... in Portugal, for example. A caryatid is not meant to display support or effort. She is a concept of woman in architecture. The return to classicism was again fashionable. De Lisle wrote "Ancient Poems". Theodore de Banville published "The Caryatids". They appeared on buildings between 1860-70... a prodigious decade that produced... Hugo's "Les Mis?rables"... Offenbach's "Belle H?l?ne"... Marx's "Das Kapital"... Flaubert's "Education Sentimentale"... Delacroix, Manet and... "Flowers of Evil" the scandalous book by Baudelaire... the poet of poets who... sang of women and suffering as no one has. "I am beautiful, like a dream of stone "My breast, where men are slain... "inspires in the Poet an eternal love... as mute as matter" "I am beautiful and demand you love only Beauty I am the Guardian Angel, the Muse and the Madonna!" "What would you say tonight, poor soul... "what would you say, my once withered heart... "to the fairest, to the best... to the dearest whose look flowers on you anew?" Baudelaire wooed Mme Sabatier for years... with anonymous poems he later signed. One night after a trial... concerning "The Flowers of Evil"... she finally gave in to him. The next day he broke off with her. "Yesterday you were a Goddess... "so convenient, beautiful, so sacred. Now you are Woman" One could cry. So could I, over Baudelaire's last 2 years. In 1866 he was 45 and famous... but also poor, worn out, bitter and ill. After a fall he became a mute hemiplegic. Yet at times he could articulate. Damn... Damnation! He died 18 months later, still mute. "Angel full of gaiety, do you know anguish, shame... "remorse, sobs, misery and the vague terror of awful nights... "pressing the heart as if crushing paper? "Angel of gaiety... do you know anguish?" "Angel of goodness, do you know hate... "darkly clenched fists, tears of bile... "when Vengeance calls out and captains our faculties? "Angel of goodness... do you know hatred?" This rarely noticed strange angel is on Rue Turbigo... facing the office for improved housing and small-home owners' aid. Its neighbors seem unaware of this giant caryatid... don't even wonder about it. For them, Turbigo's victory in 1859 gave the street its name. Or is it an upholsterer's sign... due to the sack like a tassel? The Lady with a Bag or Fortune with Myrrh... or the Odd Angel. No one knows who made her... nor what she represents. "Hail, mask or decor! Your beauty I adore!"
