I'm going to tell you a fable. Amphion's fable. Zeus, the king of gods, fell in love with Antiope, a mortal. He transformed himself into a satyr and seduced Antiope. Amphion was thus born. Amphion grew up... and learned music from Mercury who gave him a flute. Later on, Amphion became the King of Tebas. Tebas needed walls against invaders. Then Amphion went to the desert. The desert was but sand and sun. But when he started playing his flute... the grains of sand got together forming rocks. One over the other, the rocks formed walls. And the walls surrounded Tebas. This fable is a metaphor. It means that music creates life even where there's only emptiness. This metaphor means that music sets harmony... and order everywhere. Beauty is a concept. And beauty is sad. Not sad in itself, but for its fragility and uncertainty. I spend hours and hours practicing trying to improve... seeking perfection. Scales, notes, arpeggios... are my day-to-day. I'm a musician. I believe in the notes, in the music. I'm a clarinetist. The wind instruments are a bit special. Their sound comes from inside you. Well, you know every musician thinks his instrument is the most beautiful. Anyway, I'm going to practice a bit of piano. "BEAUTY IS A CONCEPT. AND BEAUTY IS SAD. NOT SAD IN ITSELF... BUT FOR ITS FRAGILITY AND UNCERTAINTY." Give me the money or I'll shoot you! Come on! Hurry up! Now get up, get up! You keep playing. Keep playing, you asshole! Hello, speaking... Hi, how are you? Sure, I can help. Right now? All right, I'm coming. Bye. "TURNING PAGE" No, no. Tempo! Tempo! Once again, please. No! More precision! Again, please. No! More tension! Again, please. Is he the one to turn pages? I'm glad you came. Of course I'd come, you called me... Come up here, young man. Are you experienced? There's a technique to it! He was a lawyer. What? A lawyer. What? A lawyer. Oh, yes! In 1923. What? In 1923. Oh, yes! He was... a lawyer. - What? - A lawyer. - It's almost time. - One minute! Listen... Today we'll put technique aside a little. I don't want perfect pauses nor perfect tempo. I don't want you to play as if taking a picture of the score. I want a painting. Music must have colors, tones, shadows... it must have a soul! Discipline, dedication and practice are the bases... but the truth of music is way beyond. That's why when you play you need to give in... and have the courage to be carried away and believe... believe in beauty! Technique is a means, not an end. I don't want you to make music. I want you to be made by music. Don't worry about mistakes, at least not today. A new violin? How was your recital yesterday? She's so beautiful... Goodness! Silence is so fragile, details are so cruel... A mistake... A mistake in music is terrifying. Music can be so generous and so harsh. You must know to choose your side... But I can't. I'm afraid of making a mistake. I'll do it. No. No! She won't be able to turn this page. Too many notes. A man cannot give up! There's no choice. Courage! Besides, except for wars, diseases and ecological disasters... all tragedy is imaginary! A true hero can still act... when all eyes are staring at him... This page is mine! BEWARE! TURN! TURN! You have to believe! Music must have a soul! "WHAT WE CAN WE CANNOT FROM ONE MOMENT TO ANOTHER." What we can, we cannot from one moment to another What we suffer, we revolve in a swamp of mud, scum and ice Not even at this time of scum, mud and fear we have clay or stones Emotion plunges its wings into this slime and grass I know its jungle Don't cut your veins for your mistakes and the mistakes of this erratic place we are not one But you'll be all, suffering from the same fear at the same mistake With another scare of scum and stone In another swamp of clay and darkness What we can, we cannot from one moment to another "AMPHION'S FABLE" "...Amphion builds in the desert with the sound of his flute... the rocks enchanted by music move by themselves..." Amphion arrives in the desert Amphion amongst rocks like forgotten fruits that refused to mature Amphion as if drawing precise circles in the sand A purely spotless gesture, he desert breathes, Amphion It's a clear time like the fountain and the fable There nothing remained from the night like grass between stones It's a white, eager earth like whitewash There you can't put your sadness on the shelf, like a book His dried flute At the desert sun and the broken silence His flute dried Without the sweet earth of water and sleep Without love grains brought by the wind Chance strikes Chance strikes and makes the flute sound The rocks enchanted by music move by themselves Tebas is built When the flute sounded, a time unfolded from time Look, it's a bit tight here, could you move your case? I need to put mine in here, okay? I have an important solo today. All right. Let's begin, please. Beginning of the second movement. Try to remember what I said before. No! No! Please! Please. I'll try to explain once again. Imagine that in this passage of the music... the strings, you... are the meadow... a beautiful landscape, an idyllic place... where we can rest under the shadow of a tree... close our eyes and dream. You are the dream... the dream we're looking for to comfort us... where we want to lose ourselves. Until the clarinet solo wakes us up. Like a sad memory that suddenly awakes us. The solo is this memory. Each note of this solo has to sound like something lost... but not in vain. As if the sadness of what we love and lose... could turn into Amphion's rocks... which enchanted by music moved miraculously... building in the desert the most vivid of all dreams: Life. Let's try once again. Measure 58, please. I just... I just wanted to say... "CHANCE STRIKES" Painters paint on canvas. Composers paint on silence. A small detail can suddenly change everything. Darkness shifts to light, silence turns into music. Music... fragile, uncertain... and wild of life.
