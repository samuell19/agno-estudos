Hey guys, I'm Tasha. This video is going to be I guess in the hope of educating people. And on behalf of those who are unable to speak up for themselves. I've been doing some crying today, it's been rough emotionally, and it's actually not the parasites this time, it is the... The opinions of other people. I know that my worth comes from God and it shouldn't matter what other people think, but the truth is I am human and as a human it does hurt when what people say can really get to us as a human. So this video is about having a disease that is called a delusional disease, doctors think it's a delusional disease. It does make me feel crazy and it makes me feel stupid, you know? But it's real. Tonight we're going to focus on a controversial and mysterious condition known as Morgellons. Its sufferers complain of stinging and crawling sensations under the skin and say their bodies sometimes grow strange string-like fibers on the surface. There are thousands who say they suffer from its bizarre symptoms, bu there are many in the worlds of science and medicine who believe that it's all in the mind. I don't even really like to call it a disease because I don't think we've quite figured out what it is. An illness that a whole lot of people are suffering from. An illness they're not getting any answers to. Not from the CDC, not from doctors. Randy Wymore started out as a skeptic too, but years ago after taking a closer look at the fibers, he changed his mind and he says other doctors might also if only they would look. I'd like the world to know that when you're a Morgellons patient, you are treated worse than you would treat your family pet. When you're rejected like that, you don't feel like living anymore, you feel like you don't have any hope. Please help the people that have Morgellons. Hey everybody. I've been taking micro shots of it with my microscope, my digital microscope. I only paid 20 bucks for it on Ebay, so the pictures are real low quality, but it will show you some stuff, so I'm gonna go through the slideshow and talk to you as I go through and point out some different things. See the symptoms of Morgellons in here? There's the 30th of April, this was the next day after the scab comes off. That's on the 1st. There's a better picture of what I'm talking about and it brings things to the surface, look at the Morgellons. I miss my $300 microscope, but those were adequate, I think they showed. Hey guys, I'm Tasha and it's been an exciting morning. Really crazy morning actually with some discovery, so thought I'd better fill you in. So it started, well I can't say it started, but it just came to light because of the video that I posted, the two videos that I posted yesterday about the worms coming out of my face, and so people did not believe that they were worms, so I was like you know what, you've gotta see what came out of my wrist. Now I have pictures of all this. I posted them last night actually and it's on my blog, so if you go to top two posts, most recent posts, I believe it's called Worm Pics Part Two. It was like the pussy organism type thing that came out, but there was this black wire in there, I'm like why is there a wire, what the heck is that wire doing, it looks like it's coming out from there and going elsewhere on my arm. Okay, so after people not believing that they were worms and then I was like I'm gonna dig out those pictures, I posted them, so it had me looking through them again and thinking about facial worms, and so I was doing a search online and I came across a video about Morgellons Disease and I'm like oh yeah, I remember people saying that that means parasites coming out of your skin and, I don't know, for some reason I just felt I had to watch it today, I hadn't really wanted to look into Morgellons Disease 'cause I'm like I know I have parasites anyway and I'm doing stuff to treat the parasites, so I don't really feel the need for another diagnosis, but today I felt drawn to watch the video, so I did, and let me tell you, it was freaky! Because I looked on the video and I'm like that thing, that organism, that is exactly what I just posted pictures of. It's got the black wire. It looked, I mean it's just exactly like it. So the people describing their symptoms on there, I'm like I have those, oh my gosh! So I guess I have Morgellons Disease too. If you're interested at all in this, you know that the symptoms that people describe with Morgellons is feeling crawling things, biting, itching, and colored threads coming out of their skin, and if it sounds like something you got, do your own research, look into a little bit. All right, well if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and I will see you next time, bye. I've rubbed crushed asprin into my skin, and you can see the Morgellons is in my cheek there. That's what's made it really puffy. It's all around my lips. It's in my chin. It's really bad there. It's actually getting better with this asprin. And in the nose, it's hard to put it on, makeup kinda falls off, but you have to just press it in. I just had a bath. I put some on my skin. My eyes are a really dark, I don't know what that's from, something to do with Morgellons. Dark dark dark under there, I don't know. I don't know why I'm like that, but I think it looks worse in this lighting than it actually is. I don't know what that's from, but not a good sign. The lips are really bad. Put it on your lips too. Got a horrible coating on your lips. So anyhow folks, there's my latest video. Regarding Morgellons symptoms, I opened a Facebook support group. I'd like you to join. That'd be great. Anyhow, thank you for watching this update of my silent superbug fiber disease Morgellons symptoms. Thank you for watching. I'm having a whole lot of thoughts, so I just keep getting the message, turn the camera on and talk, and the one thought that keeps coming up to mind for me right in this moment is mfromcanada1, over and over she is in my mind. I just want to somehow... Say hi. Your videos make me cry because you are getting on there and you are showing it like you see it and risking looking crazy. I'm not trying to say I think anything, 'cause why risk it, you know? There are a lot of us on YouTube who do. And I wanna tell you if you're watching and you're thinking about, I'd just love to get my face on there and just saying how I feel and show my piece of the puzzle, YouTube is a sweet, sweet family, guys. Morgellons videos are boring because it's very slow. It's so slow you can't capture it and it's so fast you can't capture it. Did I say that? Time to shut the camera off huh? Stacy Hillman and her husband Jeff say 2011 was the year from Hell. I was suicidal. Last March Stacy started feeling pin pricks on her skin. A few weeks later lesions covered her entire body. It felt like there was some type of bug, thousands of bugs crawling all over my face. They spent thousands of dollars going from doctor to doctor trying to get help. They basically would look at her like she was crazy. Stacy shares that skin crawling sensation with thousands of people all over the country. Its common name is Morgellon Syndrome, which the CDC doesn't recognize as legit. After months, the Hillmans finally found relief in Dr. Omar Amin in Scottsdale. He's a parasitologist, but since so many sought his help thinking they were infected by bugs, he wanted answers. I'm a hardcore, old fashioned scientist. Dr. Amin believes the problem actually comes down to dental material that's not compatible with the body's immune system. The exposure to those toxins causes nerve damage which makes it feel like the skin is crawling. The nerve cells would misfire. You have no normal nerve impulse anymore, and that misfiring will cause the sensations of movement and. The body's lymphatic system tries to eliminate those toxins through the skin which breaks out in sores and invites other biological organisms to nest. Like spores which grow long-stemmed fungus. The concept is new to science and easy to dismiss, but Dr. Amin warns thousands are at risk. Everybody who has dental work, and that's just about everybody that lives in this culture of ours, is an open game. He saved my life. He really did. Dr. Amin calls the disorder NCS for Neurocutaneous Syndrome, he sees patients from all over the world, the Hillmans came here from Los Angeles. Now Stacy is taking some homeopathic remedies, but her dentist has already started replacing her fillings with more compatible material based on her own individual blood tests. If you'd like more information you can Reporting live in Phoenix I'm Heather Moore, CBS 5 News. Hey guys, I'm Tasha. I don't know if you can tell, but my face is looking kinda strange this morning. The last few days have been extremely emotionally up and down, really difficult things, but also really good things, so I wanted to share with you about this amazing stuff, and this little piece of magic. On the first day that I realized I had Morgellons, I was reading a lot that day and one of the things that I read was that this organism has, well it's a crazy weird organism, but that pulsed magnetism overloads the circuitry. When I held it back there, I was like oh my gosh, I'm just gonna cry, it was... I felt it all over my body and it was... I could feel my head actually was going. And all these things in my eyes were just going, like I cannot believe this. It affects everything. I'm like so if the Morgellons is in my brain and is affecting function all over my body, I don't know exactly, but that was some super crazy stuff. It kept on like that and I just held it there and I'm like I'm gonna kill you, Morgellons. Eventually it kinda slowed down and I felt like... A different person, I'm like something huge happened there. Another thing that happened after using that was I woke up in the morning, and I was gonna go do the Epsom salt bath and I'm like I have to go to the bathroom. So I went and it was different, it felt very different, so I looked, 'cause I haven't been analyzing my BMs, I've been burning out on that, and we don't have a good toilet for it, but I did look that day and there was definitely big pieces of rope worm. I posted about it and a girl who says she has both the rope worm and the Morgellons, she believes it's the same organism. I'm like that's kinda an interesting thought. It seemed like whatever it was that was, I was shaking up this area, but then my gut area happened too. I think those were the big things I was gonna say, this thing is a little miracle baby. It's only $20! This, and you can get the zapper for $35, and how much does treatment cost? I'm really really excited about this. I hope this information has been giving you hope, has given you hope, and some information that can maybe help you too. If you like it, please give it a thumbs up and share it and thanks for watching, see you next time, bye. Okay, I had a couple comments lately that I have sadness in my eyes. You guys can make all kinds of comments, and I can let them slip on down the river and I can build a bridge and get over it, but that one kinda hit me because it's true, I do have sadness in my eyes, it's been really hard lately to even upload clips. I'm sad because, and you can see it in my eyes. I see it out there in the word, I see it in my children, I see it in my grandchildren, and that's not because I'm crazy. It's because they keep going to the doctor, they're complaining about something, and something is affecting their health. But they're not getting any help. And I want us all to quit suffering from disease that we don't know anything about. Unidentified disease, that makes it like a UFO. But if you see sadness in my eyes, it is, it's really there. 'Cause it's really serious, you guys. A lot of people are looking at it and a lot of people are finding dead ends. But we need a healing that comes from truth. Ourselves. Yeah, sad eyes today. It's okay. I love you guys. I really do. So I've just been using the magnetic acupressure vibrator on my nose area. Seems like some of the freckles have cleared out. This one came out on the side. I kinda tried to pull it. Oh I got it that time. That's what's left. Isn't that interesting. Huh, I've never seen it do that before. I've just seen that what comes out kinda looks like a worm shape. Busted open, this one looks like he's still coming out. All right, so I just tore him off. Interesting. It was a Morgellons machine. You will not believe this, it's got a little particle on the end of it and it is moving, look at that. 60 times magnification. See if I can adjust it a little bit more here. So it's coming from that little sample there. Did you just see that movement? Did you just see that movement? What on Earth is this? Look at this thing, oh my god. It is strong, it is very flipping strong. Oh my goodness. Just weird energy around it, it's kinda being picked up by the camera. I don't know if that's anything important or not. These are just a bunch of little pieces that came out of a sample, this came from my arm. What's all that weird stuff? My goodness. Well let's watch the fiber for a while. See if it starts moving again. Let's see if we talk to it. Wow, where did that come from? Did that just sprout out of there? Excuse me, but did you see that? It seemed to come out of there. It popped out of there and grabbed on the other fiber. What on Earth is going on? That is so weird, that totally popped out, I'm sure, you saw that didn't you? Gosh, there's another one on a little piece of fiber. Lots going on here, let's see. It just detached itself from there, oh my god, it is moving, oh my god. It is so strange. It looks like a plant, you know? To me. This is so, oh my god, I see it move, the little one is lifting up the big one, oh my god! Oh my god, the little one is under the big one and it is actually, is it lifting it up? Look at that, when it starts moving, the power, the force, the energy. Where does it get its food? It is flipping strong. Okay, flipping strong. So are you gonna move anymore, are you gonna move some more? A. Oh my god, it moved me saying the letter A! Did you see that? Oh my god. A. Now it's not reacting to that. Or is it, oh my god, now what? Oh my god, look at it. This is at 60 times magnification, I'm using a Celestron amoeba microscope. And this Morgellons sample came from my chin area. So we got these little machines. And I would really like to know where they are getting their energy from, I would really like to know that. E! That made it move too, the letter E. F. F. F. O. O. U. A. E. Wow. E. E. My goodness. I. I. I. O. O. O. U. U. U. Y. Y. Oh man, did you just see that? This is just insanity watching this work, this machine at work. It's working, it's jabbing into things, it's connecting, it's now jabbing into the other end of the little one, it's connected to the other sample. And all I had to do was say Y. Y. Y. Why are you moving to the letter Y? Why are you in my body? Why? Why? Why why why! I don't know if it's just the words or... Hey guys, I'm Tasha. Today's video is about hair. So I wanted to give you the best view of my hair. Look at that. I'm looking at it and thinking it looks like a Pantene commercial! But we all know that in the Pantene commercials they actually put stuff on there to make the hair look shiny. I don't have anything on my hair and it is so soft and shiny and gorgeous. Okay, so what's up? When I take a bath in Epsom salt, guess what came out of my body? You can't really see it, it just looks like a clump of hair. This is probably 10, 10 to 15 fibers that came out of not my head, but the bottom part of me. This came out of somewhere. The bottom part of me that was under the water, I just kept seeing these things appear in the water. And this is a clump of hair that came out of me the same day right after that bath, I took a shower and pulled this out of my head. I mean if you look at them in the camera you can't really see a difference. Close up camera, they kinda look the same too. They are fibers. This area on my head has been losing hair for a while, but I started to get these white and silvery hairs growing right there. And over here. You can see some white ones. I learned recently that what happens with Morgellons is, gotta fix the hair. Morgellons takes over the hair shaft. It kicks out your normal hair and then it starts to grow its fibers out of it. And the fibers are more wirey. Well when I started doing this parasite cleanse I was like why is my hair so nasty. Well I think because the Morgellons was getting kicked out of my head. And now those little wirey things are gone from right here and it is very soft. So isn't that interesting? Parasite cleanse is doing wonders all over my body. Now we're seeing it in the hair. Very interesting. All right, well thanks for watching. If you like this video, please give it a thumbs up. See you next time, bye. Hey everybody. Another beautiful day in Colorado. Hey check out this cup I was just noticing I was drinking. Pikes Peak, tells the elevation right there. They got these world famous donuts. Can go up there and get them. You don't even have to walk up there. Walk up for 13 miles and then have a donut? Okay, anyway, hey, got a little corner over here and try and talk to you privately. Okay, I'm gonna say some things and I'm gonna say them like I know something, but I don't really know anything, I'm just gonna tell you my thoughts and put them on table. You can shuffle it around and throw them off if you want, okay? Clifford Carnicom and Gwen Scott, I posted those videos a couple days ago, are saying that we all have Morgellons right? And I believe that to be true because everything I've looked at under the microscope that's in the... Process of death, where they're shriveled up and dying, they're full of Morgellons and it's taking over their body. Morgellons is the death process. And we do all have it, we're born with it, we're born with death. It's controlling, the death factor is very controlling, the fear of death in our culture, in our society, in our world. It totally controls us. And we, in response, wanting to find a way to fix that and not die right? I don't know, I'm not afraid of it anymore. I don't even wanna say that, you know what I mean? You don't wanna say it, I don't wanna be arrogant, but it just doesn't scare me anymore. I'm ready for that if that's the way it is. God's will be done, you know? But I am not, my nails aren't abnormally dying. So that's a good sign. Hey, thanks guys for letting me vlog for a minute. I'm trying to spit out some stuff today. Hi everybody. There's my Spooky2 setup. I've been trying this technology to help me with Morgellons symptoms. I've been trying it for about a month now and I wanna tell you a little bit more about this and how it's actually helping me. So let's just adjust the camera here. So this technology is based upon Rife, R-I-F-E, and you can look it up on Google, there's a lot of information out there on Rife and his research and to how frequencies can actually be used to help cure people of diseases et cetera. This setup here costs approximately $500 plus taxes. I do think that this would be a very good investment for just about anybody because of the ability to diagnose and also to help treat you for many things. Even if it didn't work for Morgellons it surely works for other things. The one other thing that I love about it, I absolutely love about this program, is that you don't actually have to be present for it to work and that is the most amazing thing to me. I used to try that ionic foot bath, I hated having to sit in there for so long with my feet in that bath. Couldn't go anywhere, do anything. I also tried the Hulda Clark zapper where you hang onto those copper things and you do 20 minutes and then you take a break and then another 20 minutes. I have no patience for those things, okay? I much prefer the remote settings and I'm using just fingernail clippings or toenail clippings in there of my own for the DNA. And you insert those into a magnet and the magnet, the frequency generator goes through the fingernail to either diagnose or to treat, and because we are beings, a small part of us is a whole part of us. It's like, and I understand that inherently. Okay, so what have the improvements been so far? From me using this. Well one of the main problems is my lips. The coating has almost disappeared. For over a decade I've had this plastic-like, amber colored coating on my lips that is like having glue on your lips and you have to rip the glue off every day. My lips have been nice now or pretty nice like this for two weeks now. I'm just amazed, okay? Now the other thing is the skin on my face. The skin on my face just feels so much nicer. I can't tell you, it used to just feel like it was covered in something that was suffocating me literally. Now it'll pick up other problems you might have like perhaps you got an aneurysm going on, or you might have cancer in your body going on somewhere, it's gonna pick that up. It appears that I have pneumonia. I might even have tuberculosis. Now I do think that's accurate because I've been having this terrible cough for about 10 years now coughing up this jelly-like matter. And one of the main reasons I haven't been making YouTube videos as well is because my voice, the symptoms get so bad that I find it hard to speak. Now today I seem to be able to speak quite fine for over 10 minute, but with my Morgellons symptoms it hasn't been that way. I've been lucky if I can speak a minute or two without having to stop and cough up. So anyhow folks, thank you for watching this video, I hope you appreciated my update and I will give you more updates on my trial of Spooky2 as I go along. Thank you again for watching, I'll post links below where you can get this, I'm not trying to sell it, but I'm trying to help people. I'll post links below where you can purchase the Spooky2 and try it out for yourself. Marcia signing out. Joni Mitchell's music remains as vibrant today as it was all those years ago, but here physical health is another story and now we're learning more about the mystery that may be to blame for her emergency hospitalization this week. It's a bizarre ailment known as Morgellons Syndrome. This is the face of Morgellons Disease. The people you see here on YouTube claim to be suffering from it. Many experts believe Morgellons Syndrome is a psychiatric disorder, including Dr. Charles Sophie. Is there anything really there? Usually no. I've had several cases of this over the last 20 years. Some people feel there are bugs in their skull, and we have had biopsies down to the cranium and there's nothing there. Joni called Morgellons "a slow, unpredictable killer." "I have this weird, incurable disease" "that seems like it's from outer space," Joni Mitchell once said of her condition. "Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out "of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm." "They cannot be forensically identified" "as animal, mineral, or vegetable." What is she talking about? What is she feeling? She's actually thinking and she's actually feeling that this stuff is real. For Joni Mitchell, the mystery continues. Hi. I wanted to talk to you for a minute about Morgellons. Well welcome to all you new subscribers, and if this is a conversation you're not interested in, I won't be offended, go click and watch another video because I'm gonna talk about Morgellons, what we call Morgellons and urine therapy. Which I've had experiences now for three years going on trying to fight, trying to fight the battle with this therapy, with this technique. I wanted to get very honest with you about my feelings and thoughts and experiences about it. What I would like to say in all honesty is I am still having a struggle. And it's still a daily struggle. So if you're thinking about urine therapy for pretty much any other disease or illness that I can think of, colds, hangovers, rehydrating your body, getting your blood pressure normal, getting everything normal, yeah, drink your pee, it is awesome, you can cure just about anything that I can imagine. I do it all day long every day. I drink my pee when it comes out. Sometimes I save it and drink it other ways, I drink it through my nose, I drink it in my eyes, I drink it in my ears, and my skin is the biggest one, you wanna really do a lot of massage with urine, or you can age it and it's more powerful. More stinky, more powerful in a lot of ways. But okay, so back to Morgellons. Even though the evidence of it and the affliction, the hell that is minimal in comparison to the way it was three years ago, very much so in fact, but I can't say it's cured it, I can't say it's gone. Like I said, if you're thinking you wanna cure Morgellons, the reason that Morgellons is coming are the, well I don't wanna say anything, it's not like I can say anything, but it's an expression of what we've done through ourselves through life. It's telling you it's time to clean the temple. Yeah. And you can for free. Just get in there and, well you need a cup, and you can have a cup pretty much made out of anything, I wouldn't use styrofoam, plastic, has to be like pottery or glass, brass, gold, I mean who has a gold cup laying around, but that kind of thing, use that kind of cup and catch the midstream, let a little go at the beginning, save a little, let it go at the end. Catch the middle. Just do a couple drops in your orange juice in the morning. A couple drops will treat the whole thing, just bless it. You know, it's a different way of life. Talk about red pill blue pill stuff, boy once you start doing it you don't wanna go back to that other way of life. Because it feels really healthy and it feels really good and it's very... I can't promise you anything, but it's a different kind of. I won't use those words. Start using words and people get attached. But can come unattached and just drink your pee. Yeah, got lots of people really, in this country, pee is called toxic and pee is called gross and all kinds of other ways, taking the Lord's name in vain, but we won't get into that. Hey, have a great day, I didn't mean to shed bad news, but I just gotta be honest you know? I know that the people that I've seen talking about Morgellons are usually anonymous. I have multiple friends who have talked to me about having Morgellons and thanked me for speaking about it because they can't talk about it because the people in their life will think that they're crazy, or they have brought it up and people think that they're crazy. I guess it came up for me today, I mean it's come up multiple times where I post pictures and people say oh that's nothing, oh that's nothing. I posted the video yesterday of the Morgellons coming out of the side of my nose and everybody who commented said it looks like dead skin. The thing with Morgellons is the stuff that comes out of you can easily be explained as something else. The long fibers that come out of me look like hair. The ones that grow in my head look like hair. The little worms that have come out of my face, people say they look like whiteheads coming out of my face. Or the little one that looks like the little piece, it looks like dead skin, it looks like dry skin. What can I say? These things come out all over my body and... If you're an outsider who just sees one little snippet of it, it's easy to think that that's what it is, it's just dead skin or whatever. But if you're in my body, and I am closely observing everything about what's going on, it's pretty exhausting, it can be pretty exhausting 'cause you're not only dealing with physical stuff, but you're also dealing with this relational stuff and it can be really hard for people with these illnesses who don't have any support, I mean I'm so grateful for Facebook. There's groups online for all this stuff. For people who are dealing with these things where nobody in their real life gets them. I guess I just wanna educate those of you who are unfamiliar with invisible illnesses like Lyme and mold, multiple chemical sensitivity, Morgellons. So you know what we're going through, I mean I know it can be hard because it's like seriously you're making a big deal out of nothing, but why would somebody make this up? Why would you continue to talk about something when people say oh you're crazy? Why would you keep talking about it? And subject yourself to more people telling you you're crazy? You wouldn't do that unless it's really happening. Or unless you have a delusion I guess, but the thing is there are so many people with this, how can it be a delusion? In conclusion, thank you so much for those of you who have been so supportive throughout this whole thing, it's really not easy to deal with. There are some good days, there are some really tough days. It's getting better though, I'm getting so much better. I don't know what I would've done without online support and without people who get me. My friends, I have some really good Lyme Aid friends who are getting me through this stuff. And we tell each other that we're not crazy. My friend today said she's gonna kick your butt. If anyone gives me a hard time, she's gonna kick your butt. Anyway, I mean it's just good to know that you have people who've got your back because we all need people, we all need human love. Even if we're okay with none ourselves and know that we're walking the right path, it's just really really important to have people in our lives who... Who get us and understand and love us and accept us and tell us we're not crazy. All right, thanks for watching this video. See you later, bye. Hi everybody. In response to a Morgellons video of mine, AscendingStarSeed wrote this. "I really feel sorry for you, lady." "Fear has taken total control of your life." First of all, you do not feel sorry for me at all, that's a bald-faced lie. And fear has not taken control of my life. I actually don't fear anything. You don't know me one bit. Because if you did know me, you'd know that I was the bravest person you'll probably ever meet. "The alt news community has failed so many" "people with constant fearmongering, hate, anger," "and feelings of powerlessness over the boogeyman." What has that got to do with my video? Okay. Nothing. The boogeyman didn't create Morgellons. It was created by people that make war, it's a weapon of war, it's bioterror. You need to wake up. I've actually disclosed the cause of Morgellons. I've actually disclosed the coverup of Morgellons by the CDC. I don't know what to say to people like you. I don't know what to say to people like you. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, loving or kind whatsoever in your comment. There's no empathy whatsoever. You think you know everything and you know nothing. I actually really hope that you get Morgellons, I do, because it'll be a great learning lesson for you. A great learning lesson, and you'll probably learn somewhere in there to have some compassion and empathy for people instead of making hurtful, hateful comments like this one. AscendingStarSeed, you're not welcome on my page and you're getting blocked. And I actually hope everybody goes over to your channel and tells you what they think of you for writing this sort of comment because you're heartless and I don't want heartless people in my world. They don't belong. There are things that... Oh my gosh, it's like... Why turn on the recorder, why talk to you? But when you're the only one that I can talk to... And I get frozen and he's frozen, I mean paralyzed. I would love love love to pass the system of diagnosis. But I've been diagnosed with some pretty heavy stuff lately. Psychotic Depression. And I researched that and I looked it up just to see. WTF. Is that, sounds pretty psychotic. I don't feel psychotic. But it's deep. Sorry I have not been showing up. It's because I don't wanna record depressing videos like this. You know what I'm saying? I've been talking to this group I'm in, so that's good. But... I have a feeling the group I'm in is for people who are on the edge of suicide or have just been on the edge and dove over, I'm not sure. It's interesting, there are people that I've grown to love in just one week. Isn't that weird? I'll hang in there for you guys, I will. I wanna give you my word, I will not commit suicide. I will look you in the eye right now and tell you if for some reason I don't show up, I wanna keep showing up consistent so I'm not crying wolf, I'm not on that edge. I don't think about ways and means to do that. But I'm having a little trouble living in this existence right now. Why, I don't have a clue. It's good to know that you're there. But when you're in this state, it doesn't matter if there's a million people there. It's so weird. What state am I in, I don't know. I don't wanna turn the camera off because who wants to watch somebody who's in this state, right? I don't. You don't. It's real, I mean it's really where I'm at, you guys, right now. You hear people say well you quit drinking your pee, no, no that is not it. It's not, I'm missing because, you know, whatever. Thanks for watching, I mean I'm sure this is getting a little too long. All right, okay, it's time to turn it off and I'm just checking in. Thanks for your love and support. I'll keep talking to you, I gotta keep talking to you guys, I just have to keep talking to you. Don't forget you have my word, sorry I'm wiping my snot on my hand. I just won't do it, okay? And I hope you don't either. Let's just hang in here together. I love you guys. It's an emotional meeting. These people from all over the country all suffer from a baffling disease, including the youngest patient, this little three year old. Everything about this is not normal, it's gonna be really hard. I'm just scared. Very scared. Using magnifying devices they comb their bodies, examining what they say are outbreaks of the disease. I've had 17 visits with doctors over the past three years. All of them except one have basically laughed at me. I don't think these patients are crazy. At Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, Dr. Ronda Casey believes Morgellons is a genuine illness. Dr. Casey says all her patients exhibit the same types of lesions and scars. She says they are definitely not self-inflicted. They all appear to be eruptions more than scratched areas on their skin. Dr. Casey has taken numerous fiber samples and says they're unlike anything she's ever seen. They are not textile, they are not any known substance. Doctor Casey and her colleague Dr. Randy Wymore take the samples to Tulsa's crime lab. Morgellons fibers are not any known textile. Cotton or rayon or nylon, not any of those. What's more, the fibers don't burn when exposed to high heat. Have you ever done a fiber that didn't vaporize completely other than the Morgellons fiber? No. Many in the medical community are nonetheless skeptical, but people who say they have Morgellons are desperate. Look at the evidence, that's all we ask. Look at the evidence. Hey guys, so it's kinda big day, big moment. I have been losing my hair. It started out down here, it's been getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter as the Morgellons come out. The moving hairs, I think my whole head is Morgellons affected, I think I'm gonna be losing all of my hair, and I can't really do much with it because it's too short to do a ponytail or whatever. I talked with a friend who has Morgellons and he agreed with me that it would be probably a good thing to go ahead and take it off and then be done with it, and then I will grow new hair, but this is all infected. It's gonna happen. A little nervous, so here we go. Got my husband's thing, oh you should know I have shaved my hair a few times in the past, so it's not new to me, but I've never done it while I've had a YouTube channel. All at once here. No turning back. Oh gosh, I'm scared. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! I might need a wig. Oh my gosh, what am I doing? Think I'll be wearing a hat to church this week. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I should give myself a mohawk, I've never had one before. So I cam maybe still hide it at this point. So there's me with a mohawk. Oh golly. I don't wanna be doing this, I wanna have long hair. I can tell you what, I'm looking down at these hairs all over my body going ha ha! I beat you, Morgellons. I'm throwing you in the trash can. Looks like I have cancer right? Well I do kinda, you know? Got these tumors and lumps. These parasites are causing which grows into cancer, we probably all have things that could grow into cancer in our bodies. All right. Better get some sunshine on that thing. Oh wait, the sunshine is covered up by chemtrails. All right. Oh my goodness. See ya! We are literally separating society into two different segments, and those two segments are like those that are awake and those that are still asleep. You can't be any other way. So what is happening is you are literally getting two different realities. You have the reality of those that are awake and you have the reality of those that are asleep. I don't know how many of you have watched videos by the Tool Tech Knowhow by the name of Almine, but she describes the Earth as separating like an egg. You have the yolk, you have the white, and then you know in the bible it talks about the end times and how the weed will be separated from the chaff. So I think that's what's happening right now. I don't even really feel like I am in this society anymore. When I go downtown I look at all the people, I hate to say it, but they look semi-retarded. They do. They're all drooling or they're, I don't know, it really is starting to freak me out because they literally look like they're mentally disabled, all of them. It's kinda scary, and so I don't interact very much with anybody out there because, first of all, I don't even feel like I'm in this world anymore. I literally feel sorta like I'm... Becoming ethereal. Becoming less connected, less solid, less, yeah I have to say that. I just don't feel like I'm any part of that world, the ones who are asleep, at all anymore. It doesn't bother me at all, but I wanna get to the new place where all the awake people are. So anyhow... It's just how I feel, I hope people aren't insulted. It's just enlightening. Thanks for watching, mfromcanada1. Wow, wow guys, you know? Some absolutely amazing things going on. We're all just lighting up like little lotus flowers everywhere. 10,000 subscribers. What does that mean, all of a sudden, I mean just like that. 10,000 of us understand that original sin, the one that Jesus died for, one sin, one God, one meaning to our story as human beings. We're not humans doing all that Tree of Knowledge garbage. System goes so so deep, but 10,000 people, and I'm not saying I'm one of them, I'm not. But let's look and see what happens because all kinds of things come clear at about six months of gulping those glasses all day long, all day long. Six months is not that long guys, it's gonna pass. It's gonna pass either way. 'Cause y'all are counting time. I'm counting time too, I got 1,032 days. I'm reading quite a bit of different scripture about counting days. Being blessed, when you wait and you sit quiet and you don't expect anything and you don't try and make things happens, you just. Like that, you know? The nose knows. 10,000 subscribers. Wow. I was amazed, guys it's a lie. It's a big fat lie and I'm not trying to blame anybody because all of us have been lied to, we lie to our kids, we lie to our kids' kids. I did too. For years. Change their diapers and tell them that's gross shit, to throw that away. Pee is nontoxic guys, been drinking it all for almost three years. It's just wow. And we're all putting pieces together. Very, very rapidly. Just hang on with your arms up and it's okay 'cause we're on the ride, we're in the river, we're all flowing, it's all flowing as one. One solid unit. A very intelligent, very loving. Very loving kindness from the God heart, the bottom of God's heart, and who am I? I'm not to say. I can't say what's in God's heart, only you know. Really, it's a you thing with God. One and one make one. We are all one. Just one, there's no other number that's important. Nope. Just one, just you. Just... 10,000 subscribers. I love you, I love love love you. And that matters absolutely none. I'm just speaking for you. I'll love you 'till you can love yourself like I love you.
