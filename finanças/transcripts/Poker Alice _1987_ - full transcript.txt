(gentle music) (birds chirping) (hooves clopping) (dramatic music) (hooves clopping) (horse snorts) (intense music) (hooves clopping) (water splashing) - Dead or alive! (gunshot blasts) (horse whinnies) (gunshots blasting) (gun cocks) (gunshots blasting) (horse whinnies) (gunshots blasting) (downhearted music) (hooves clopping) (birds chirping) (hooves clopping) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (cart clattering) (energetic music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (cows mooing) (energetic music) (hooves clopping) (dramatic music) (luggage clattering) (water splashing) (sign creaking) (upbeat music) (hooves clopping) (upbeat music) - [Driver] Whoa. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (cows mooing) (items clattering) (chickens clucking) (dramatic music) - I told you in New Orleans how it would be out here. - You most certainly did not. - The hell I didn't. - The hell you did. - I told you how it is out in this country. I was honest with you. - You never once mentioned the dust storms, the sand fleas, the beetles, and the damn loneliness of it all. - I asked you to come out here and live with me and you came. (luggage clattering) I even let you bring your cousin with you if he is your cousin. - You leave cousin John out of this. - The only place we ever lost him was in the bedroom and even then I could feel him hovering around the door jamb like some anxious mother. - You didn't tell me you were a widower with three children either. - I forgot. - You forgot. Dear lord. - That's right. I forgot to tell you. In New Orleans- - In New Orleans? In New Orleans, we wined and danced the night away and mister, I can hardly wait to go back. - Suppose you'll be going back to what you were when I met you. - Yes, I suppose I shall. I'm rather good at it. Remember? (driver grunts) (cart clatters) - I warned you in New Orleans, didn't I? I told you you couldn't believe anything a westerner says. They're the most adept liars in the entire world. - I wouldn't say that. - Then don't. Westerners. (object clicking) (footsteps pattering) We'd like to go to New Orleans. - From here? - Well we got to hear from there. You do have trains going east, don't you? They don't just all go west and disappear do they? - Got just as many going east as going west. That's kind of the way it works out. (spits) - When is the uh, next one? - Four days. - Four days? - Well now, there's a westbound going through tomorrow morning. You can take that as far as King City if you have a mind to and layover there for the eastbound. - There's nothing at all until tomorrow morning? - That's what I just got done telling you, didn't I? Now if you care to sit a spell I'll take you over to my house and I can rent you bed for a dollar. If you're hungry supper will be another dollar. If you wanna wash up that's 50 cents and rags to dry with is a quarter. - Probably charge for the use of your outhouse, too. - Now what kind of a fellow do you think I am to charge you for the use of his outhouse? - Well, it's something anyway. - Paper'll cost you 50 cents. (birds chirping) (cows mooing) (chickens clucking) - What were you? - I beg your pardon? Well I heard you tell that man you're going back to what you were good at. What was it that you were so good at? - Not what you're thinking. - What am I thinking? - Considering the pitifully few things a woman is permitted to be in this world you're probably thinking prostitute. - No, 'cause you don't look anything like one of them. You don't look anything like uh Nelly pig or Diamond Tooth Lil. I'm Jeremy Collins. What's yours? - Apparently you suffer from overdeveloped curiosity. Now will you please leave me alone? - Sure. Easiest thing to do in this world is just leave somebody alone. - Alice. Alice, we'll have to stay here tonight. - This gentleman has informed me there isn't a train going east for four days. (Alice sighs) Tomorrow morning we'll go to a place called King City. Wait for it. - Mighty lively place, King City. It was named after a poker hand where a pair of kings beat a full house. - How could a pair of kings beat a full house? - Easy. Fellow with a pair of kings pulled a 45. (dramatic music) (door creaking) (luggage rustling) (Jeremy grunts) (dishes clattering) Well now uh, you two come with me. - Which two? - The woman and that one there that looks like he was weaned on a pickle and growed up wormy. (footsteps rustling) (Alice laughing) (suitcase clatters) (Alice coughs) This is where me and my woman used to sleep. She always claimed she was gonna fix it up pretty but she never got around to it. - Where is she, your woman? - I buried her. Had to, she was dead. Yeah, I come in here one day and she was sitting at the table deader than a can of corned beef. Poor woman didn't even have a chance to finish her bowl of prunes. Hit me pretty hard, ma'am, but what come close to shaking me was after I'd done finished digging her grave I come in here to get her and she was all stiffened up harder than a railroad tie. I couldn't straighten her out. Had to bury her sitting up. Poor woman has to sit up straight and proper 'til judgment day. Uh, if you'd care for a bowl of prairie hen stew that ain't but a week old I can give you a discount. - Oh, uh I'm, I'm not hungry. Thank you really. (laughs) (Alice sighs) - Why don't we take turns sleeping while the other keeps watch? - Oh. (laughs) - When I think we could be in New Orleans tonight dining at Antoine's, violins, vintage wine. - Oh, stop torturing yourself. We're where we are and that's it. - King City. Probably another one of these western holes with nothing but saloons and gambling. (latch clicks) Alice. (footsteps clicking) Alice, what are you doing? No, I take it back. I know what you're doing. You're planning on gambling when we get there, aren't you? - Of course. - Of course. You'll sit at the table with men and they'll become familiar with you and one of them will take vulgar liberties and I'll have to shoot him just like I had to shoot that man in Natchez. (cards rustling) Alice, every time you sit at the table something disastrous happens to both of us and you know it. - Do stop going on so, cousin John. It inhibits my concentration. - Your concentration be damned. I'm gonna be killed someday because of you. Dead riders are of no use to anyone, especially to himself. - You haven't written a word in months and I haven't gambled in months. (John coughs) I just hope I'm not getting rusty. (liquid splashing) That stuff's gonna kill you. - Something eventually kills everyone. This just happens to be my choice. (upbeat music) (horses whinnying) (hooves clopping) (horse nickers) - I've never been after a bounty hunter before. - I never even heard of going after a bounty hunter. - But there's a lot of things ain't been done 'til somebody done 'em. (suspenseful music) There's a first time for everything except dying and that ain't a first time. It's an only time. - You sure are deep thinker, JD. Ain't he a deep thinker though, Mason? - Makes me tremble. (suspenseful music) - Let's go. (intense music) (water splashing) (gentle music) - I don't reckon you'd uh, care for a plate of stew before it leaves home and goes off on its own. - Oh, I ate last week. Thanks. - Well, ain't that queer. This stew hasn't been heated up for three days and it's still bubbling. - It's not bubbling. There's something swimming in there. - By dang, you're right. (liquid plops) - (laughs) This man come through here the last few days? - You trying to spoil my appetite? - You seen him? - No, I ain't seen him. Don't wanna see him. Don't ever wanna see nobody as ugly as him. - Well if he comes through here, don't mess with him. Telegraph the sheriff up in King City. You hear? (John knocks) - Be an angel and turn off the light will you? Here. (John sighs) (footsteps patter) (trunk clatters) - Don't you think it'd be safer to leave it on? - Oh, John. (laughs) Do you think some horrid hairy six-legged thing is gonna come crawling out of a hole to get you? - Alice, I wish you hadn't suggested that. - (sighs) Oh, John. Will you please turn off the light and come to sleep? - Alice. Just in case. - Oh, thank you. (bed creaks) (John sighs) (crickets chirping) (Alice sighs) - (sighs) Goodnight, cousin Alice. - Goodnight, cousin John. (gentle music) (goat bleating) (dog howling) (bed creaking) (footsteps pattering) (dramatic music) (gun rustling) (gun clattering) (Alice sighs and laughs) - Sorry. Hope I didn't wake you. - (laughs) I'm not a heavy sleeper. (sighs) Particularly not in a place like this. - Would you like some coffee? - Thank you. (liquid splashing) Thanks. - Welcome. - Do you do this often? - What's that? - Wander around the prairie, saddlebags and no horse. - Oh, well my horse was shot this morning. Third horse I've lost like that this year. - Really? - Yeah. (laughs) - Are you a lawman or a bandit? - Apparently you suffer from an overdeveloped curiosity. - (laughs) Touche. I'm Alice Moffit. I'm from Boston, Massachusetts. I'm an only child and I dislike the color orange. - I'm Jeremy Collins. I'm from nowhere trying to get somewhere and I have picked a low road to get there. - Tax collector? - I'm a bounty hunter, Miss Moffit. I bring 'em in dead or alive. No questions asked. - (laughs) You sound like you really enjoy your work. - No, I don't. I never have, but I'm good at it. I've been doing it since the war. This uh, poster here, this is my last one and he's worth $5,000. When I get him I'm going to California. You ever been to California? - I haven't even thought about it. - That's good country. Good weather all year. Kinda perfect for horse breeding, you know? - Is that what you plan to do? - That's precisely what I plan to do, soon as I bring him in. I don't like to leave unfinished business. - Uh this place we're going to tomorrow, King City, do you know it well? - Well enough to know you won't like it. It's not a town for a lady. - Is that what you've decided I am? - Well, you talk like a lady and you certainly look like a lady. - And you've already decided I won't like this town because there's lots of liquor and gambling, all that? - Mostly all that. - Alice, don't you think it's about time you got some sleep? - (sighs) I doubt I'll go back to sleep but I suppose I should try. Well, thanks for the coffee. - My pleasure. Miss Moffit, I work out of King City. Maybe we'll meet again. (crickets chirping) (footsteps pattering) Miss Moffit. I just wanted another look. (gentle music) Good night. - Good night. (dramatic music) (curtain clattering) (energetic music) (liquid splashing) Why are you staring at me? - You've read that bible since we were children. I often wonder why. Is it all those gory beheadings, murders, (Alice laughs) assassinations, fiery furnaces? Is that what intrigues you? - This is the only thing father ever gave me that he didn't take back after he disowned me. Maybe that's why I read it. This book, this book and royal flush are the only two things in my life that have never changed. And you of course, cousin John. You've never changed. - You like him, don't you? - I beg your pardon? - That horseless ne'er-do-well. You're rather taken with him, aren't you? - I- I barely know him. - You got out of bed in the middle of the night to talk to him. - [Alice] Cousin John. - Just trying to protect you, Alice. - Are you telling me what kind of man I should like and shouldn't like? - Well, you haven't been very successful with men thus far, have you? - Well, more successful than you've been with these, these pages that keep promising to turn into a novel. - Oh, Alice, there's no need to change the subject by insulting me. - John, we have been together since the year one and I have loved you like a brother, but at times you can be so tedious. - Tedious? Alice, it's amazing I'm not in a mad house. - Oh, yes. A proper Bostonian in a heathen land and a writer of promise who hasn't put pen to paper in more than a year. - How can I when you occupy all my time? When my every waking hour is devoted to you? - Are you trying to tell me that I'm the reason you don't write? Is that what you're trying to tell me? - [passenger] 700, 800, 900. Hm. (Alice scoffs) (whimsical music) (passenger coughs) (liquid splashing) (gentle music) - Yes, Miss? - Sherry, please. - I don't mean any disrespect Miss, but this parlor car is first class only. - I am first class. Can't you tell? (gentle music) (train car rattling) - When's the last time you saw something like that west of the Mississippi? (McCarthy laughs) (intense music) (hooves clopping) (gunshots blasting) (chickens clucking) (intense music) (gunshots blasting) (door clattering) (footsteps skittering) (objects clattering) - (laughs) Not a bad likeness, is it? - (laughs) You could scare all the kids with it. - Bounty hunter left it. (panting) That Collins. For a whole year now, every time a breeze comes up I can smell him coming. (objects clattering) Now it's my turn. (dramatic music) - The one who left this, where'd he go? (gun clatters) - K- K- King City. - I reckon he told you to use that there telegraph if you happen to see me. (dramatic music) Yeah, that sure is what he told you. (intense music) (gunshot blasts) You ain't never seen me, old man. In your whole miserable life, you ain't never seen me. (train rumbling) - Oh, my. My goodness, (laughs) I'm sorry. (gasps) - Are you all right? - (laughs) Yes, I... Oh yes. How clumsy of me. (gasps) - And I, I think it's the train that's clumsy, ma'am. - (laughs) Would it be terribly forward if I were to ask if I could sit here for a moment? The man in the seat next to me is smoking the most frightful cigar. (laughs and coughs) Of course, your wife will be back. - Cousin. - I beg your pardon? - The lady sitting next to me who occupies that seat is my cousin. We are traveling together. You might say I'm uh, her guardian. - How quaint. (John laughs) (man grunts) - Excuse me. May I introduce myself? My name is Paul McCarthy. - Alice Moffit. - Miss? Mrs.? - Miss. - Miss Moffit, uh, how are you enjoying our New Mexico territory? - Well all I can say is, Mr. McCarthy, out here one feels less constrained by ancient protocol and family tradition, if you know what I mean. - Well, I think that what you are saying is, Miss Moffit, that you enjoy the freedom to do as you please. - Exactly. - Well in that case, I feel free to invite you to join me and my friends. Are you uh, familiar with a card game called stud poker? - Well I, I have played it. - I assure you that anything you lose would be returned to you after the game. Uh, my friends and I would never think of taking money from a lady. (Alice sighs) It is your company that we prize. - What if by some strange happenstance, I should win? - Naturally, uh, you would keep your winnings, Miss Moffit. Our losses to you be our pleasure. - Oh. (laughs) How fortunate for the weaker sex. (McCarthy laughs) - Gentlemen, may I introduce Miss Moffit? Mr. Carter, Mr. Gray. - Gentlemen. - Pleasure. Ma'am. - Uh, what did you say this game is called? - A five card stud, Miss Moffit. - Oh. - Of course if you'd prefer another game why, (laughs) we'd be more than happy to accommodate. - Oh, not at all. I mean it really is just to pass the time, isn't it? - You know how to deal Miss Moffit? - Well, perhaps not as well as you gentlemen, but I- I- I can deal. - Please, do us the honor. - We'll let you set the limit, Miss Moffit. - Really? (laughs) Can't that be dangerous? (men all laugh) - Well, we're not worried. (gentle music) - Card. The game is five card stud. Nothing wild and no limit. - No limit. - Oh. (laughs) Limits are such a bother don't you think? - You know, it's so unusual to see a gentleman like yourself reading the Bible. Are you a man of the cloth? - It's not mine. - Oh. So- Well, if you're not a preacher, may I ask what you are? - I- I'm a writer. - (gasps) Really? (John laughs) A writer. Huh. What have you written? - Nothing. - Hm. I see. (laughs) Hm. So you're traveling in search of the right atmosphere. - No, I'm, I'm, I'm traveling because uh, my cousin is traveling. - I myself enjoy travel. A new face, a chance encounter. - [Attendant] Supper. Supper service. Supper. Supper service. - Oh, the book of Proverbs. So filled with beautiful truths. The lips of a strange woman dropped as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil. - But her end is bitter as wormwood. Sharp as a two edge sword. - Perhaps I'll just leave you to your Bible and to the care of your cousin. (sighs) Pity. - How do you think you're gonna like playing poker when you learn how to play the game, Miss Moffit? (gentleman snaps) - Does the lady over there work this road regularly? - Never seen her before. - Queens bet, 500. (cards rustling) (cash rustling) - [Carter] Ten of hearts. King of diamonds. - The queens bet, 1000. (cash rustling) - Queen of spades, 10 of clubs. - The three ladies bet, 3000. (McCarthy grunts) - I'll be right back. (sighs) Jake, lend me a few thousand. I can't let her get away with a bluff like that. - What makes you think she's bluffing, McCarthy? - Oh, she's gotta be bluffing. - No woman can have a run of luck like that. - The cards don't know she's a woman. - It's just a few thousand. - I don't loan money, McCarthy. You know that. - Jake, (laughs) she's cleaned me out. The only thing I got left is my house. - You're so dumb, McCarthy. You know that? Look at that face. You don't see a poker face like that in no choir loft. Can't learn it in no finishing school for young gentlewomen either. See it across poker tables from Boston to San Francisco and from Chicago to El Paso. Seems to me all you can do is fold. Your call. - Jake, she's bluffing. I know it. - You don't know nothing about her. You already proved that. But if you're so sure she's bluffing, McCarthy, you shouldn't mind putting up your house. (McCarthy grunts) (floor creaks) - I have a house in King City. It's gotta be worth at least $3,000. - Do you know this man? For how long? - Years. - Does he have a house? Then it's your play. - I call. (card rustling) - A straight does not beat a full house. (dramatic music) Where's my house? (dramatic music) (mysterious music) (animals calling) - I don't like it. - It couldn't be nobody but him. - That's why I don't like it. He's smarter than that, to have a fire going. - He don't know we're after him. - This whole thing smells like an invitation to a party I don't want to go to. - Then let me go. I owe him one. - Well, what if it ain't him? - It won't be the first mistake we ever made. (suspenseful music) (animals howling) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) (gunshots blasting) (objects rustling) - Hit 'em, boy. (hooves pattering) (gun cocking) (gunshot blasts) - Oh! (upbeat music) (driver shouting) (people chattering) - [Driver] Whoa, there. - This is it? - This is King City, lady. What'd you expect? A Kentucky estate? - (sighs) Well, it certainly doesn't look like it's worth $3,000. - Yeah. (laughs) It's what's inside that counts. (footsteps pounding) (people laughing) (ladies shouting) (people laughing) - Told you you like it. - Mr. McCarthy. I would like to speak to you in private. - Well. (ladies giggling) - Ma'am, that's my hat. - Hi honey. We're gonna play climb the mountain and I'm going to be the mountain. (ladies laughing) - You sir, are a liar. - Me? How'd I lie? I said I had a house. Is this a house? - I want my $3,000. - Oh, you'll get it lady. Your split with the girls is 60/40. - Is it indeed? - Every one of those girls averages 8, 10 winks seven days a week. - Excuse me. Eight- - And some- - Excuse me. What is a wink? - (laughs) A wink is all a man gets until he pays. In this house, every wink pays. Why this house earned me over $5,000 last year so don't tell me it ain't worth three. - I am not a madam. - (laughs) You are now. - I certainly am not. Why without those women you couldn't get $200 a year in rent for this house. - You don't want it, huh? - No, I don't want it. - Well, it's all right with me. You do it your way. I'll keep the house and uh, we'll forget the whole thing. (ladies laughing) (footsteps clicking) (door slams) - The devil we'll forget the whole thing. You lost. I won. (McCarthy grunts) What's your whole name? - Alice Moffit. (drawer clatters) - Alice Moffit. Well, (sighs) Alice Moffit, (pen scratching) you're in business. (footsteps clicking) But if you want some advice, don't raise the rates. There's too many going in this town for less. (door clattering) (ladies laughing) Good luck, Alice Moffit. - You're very kind but I'm going now. Would you, would you give me my hat back please? Thank you. - You are the prettiest thing I have ever seen in my life. - Thank you so much. - Now can I help you with your bloomers, sir? - No, no, no, no. Thank you very much. - Are you sure? - I'll just take them. They must be very heavy. - Now, I'll see you later. Remember, you promised. - Promised? Promised what? - To see me later. - Oh, well then I'll see you later. (door slams) This is a zoo, an absolute zoo. There're animals here. (sighs) Alice, Alice, you're not entertaining the idea. - Oh. (laughs) Of course not. - Good. Then why do you look so contended? So like a pussycat with her belly full of warm cream? - (laughs) I was just thinking what father would say if he could see me now and where I am. - Well, if he thought gambling was disgraceful enough to banish you from Boston and our family I can... Alice, this is typical of what happens every time you play poker. - This game isn't over with yet. One way or the other, I'm going to get my $3,000. - [Baby Doe] Come on now. Give it to me. - Get your hands off me. - Give my money. - I ain't giving you nothing and that's that. - Damn, you. You promised to pay me 'cause ain't no sanitarium and I ain't here for no help, jerk. Ow! Give it to me. - You. (both grunt) - Me? - Yes, you. Come in here. - Who's she? - I don't know. (footsteps clicking) (door clatters) - What is your name? - Betsy Jenkins but they call me Baby Doe. - Well Baby Doe, I'm the new owner now. Has this man been with you? - Yes. - Then pay her. - No, she won't do nothing. - I did too. - What exactly do you want her to do? - Well, she could act like she's alive. She don't even talk to me. - What would you like her to say? - She can at least say something sweet. - For example? - Like she loves me or something. - Do you love him? - Love him? (laughs) - Obviously she doesn't love you. Do you want her to lie to you? - I don't want her to lie to me. I want her to say it and mean it. - Then just pay her for her time. - I ain't giving her nothing. - Cousin Alice only meant it as a suggestion. (birds chirping) (money slamming) - Pick it up, hand it to her and say, "Thank you." (gunshot blasts) (door clatters) (birds chirping) - I ain't saying thank you. (gun clatters) Thank you. (mysterious music) - Well, my name is Alice Moffit. I'm the new owner of this house. (dramatic music) (people chattering) (hooves clopping) - Back in town, huh? - What's it look like to you, Jack? - [Jack] Looks like to me you're back in town. That's how come I commented on it. (paper rustling) - There you go. (grunts) - Ugly, ain't he? - Seems to be the general opinion. - What's he wanted for? - Everything but being ugly. Killed a man in Fort Worth, one in Albuquerque, another in Tucson. - Sounds like he's aiming to start his own graveyard. (bags clattering) (Charlie coughing) (Jeremy laughs) What's your hurry? - Oh, I gotta get cleaned up. There's a lady in town. - A what? - A lady. Uh, you've seen one of those somewhere in your life, haven't you, Johnny? - Only my mother and she didn't live in King City. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (horse knickering) - Whoa, now you be safe. (hooves clopping) - I'll be in the saloon. (hooves clopping) (mysterious music) (crickets chirping) - It's unbelievable. Look at this. - There were three murders in town last week and all of 'em no doubt approved by the town council. What a hole. - (laughs) I don't know why you sound so outraged. You almost shot a man today over $3. - It isn't true. My only intention was to unsettle him. - (laughs) Like the man in Natchez. - Natchez, I meant to shoot over his head. Was it my fault he stood up at the same time I pulled the trigger? What are you doing? Aren't you going to bed? - Hm-mm. Going downstairs. - I think we should talk. - (sighs) You sound like you're going to be serious. - Is it your intention to wander from card table to card table for the rest of our lives? - John, I am going to gamble until something more exciting comes along. I have no intentions whatsoever. - Everyone has intentions. Everyone with a brain larger than a kidney bean. A plan at least, a focus on the future. - I have never thought about the future or the past either. Only thing that concerns me is the present and not all that much either. - Well, maybe it should concern you. Maybe you should have a thought for the future. You're not getting any younger, you know. - You calling me old and wretched? - No, but you're not young and virginal anymore are you? - Be an angel and fetch me my red dress from the closet, will you please? - Fetch me this, fetch me that. I can't remember a time when I wasn't fetching for you. Even in the bath as children, "Be an angel and fetch me the soap." You aren't really going downstairs, are you? - Yes, I am. - Well, why? - When we came in I saw poker tables. Poker tables and men with money. (door clatters) (people chattering) (door slams) (people laughing) (energetic music) (people chattering) (footsteps clicking) Is this game open to anyone? - Yeah. You know somebody who wants to play? (people laughing) - My name is Alice. - Lady, this is kind of a serious game. You know what I mean? - I wouldn't sit in on game if it wasn't serious. - Well, w- what he means is uh, you ain't gonna have to go powder your nose and go potty every 15 minutes, are you? (laughs) - You have the cards. If it's your deal, deal. (energetic music) (people chattering) (cards rustling) Just a minute. - What? - I didn't see the shuffle. (chips clattering) (dealer sighs) (energetic music) (people chattering) (cards shuffling) (cards shuffling) (people chattering) - There you go. (Jeremy sighs) - I haven't seen you for a while, Jeremy. - Well. (lips smack) - Been outta town? - Miss me? - You know I did. I'm drinking in you're buying. (sighs) Do you wanna see me tonight? (energetic music) (people chattering) - Excuse me. (people chattering) - Come on. 150? Well, I'll raise you my hand for that. - Check. (people chattering) (dishes clinking) - I call. - $150. Raise 50. (people chattering) 200. - 50. - Does your cousin play poker as well as you drink uh, cousin John? Well, we're both professional. Breeding demands it. Ah, yes. Breeding can be a terrible burden. - Huh? How would you know? - You don't like me, cousin John. Why is that? - 'Cause you call me cousin. You know I really couldn't bear it if any of these people heard it. They might think we're related. - That's one reason but you have another reason. What is it? - I think you know very well. That's her better skill, right. - I see. - No, I don't think you see at all. - I call. What you got? - Four 8s. Eat your heart out. (footsteps clattering) - That woman, tell her I want to see her in my office before she leaves. - Yes, sir. (hooves clopping) - [Bandit] Hey can I tell you the truth? There's a lot of places I'd like to see before I die but this King City ain't one of 'em. - Just gonna ride into town. I'm gonna kill him then we're gonna ride out again. That's all there's gonna be to it. - I don't mean no offense, but I- I don't think you're good enough to take him. - Him still here, ain't I? - Yeah, but what bothers me is he is too. - Come on. (hooves clopping) (hand knocking) - Come in. - You said you wanted to see me. (upbeat music) (glasses clattering) (footsteps pattering) - Close the door and sit down. - I don't take orders from anyone. - Oh. Won't you uh, please close the door and sit down? (door slams) (footsteps clicking) My name is Jake Sears and I got a problem. My problem is I don't know who you are. Who are you? - What difference does it make? - This is my place. I make it a point of knowing who turns the cards. Also, I saw what you did to McCarthy (laughs) on the train. - Mr. McCarthy was a poor unfortunate, begging to be taken. - He was the only competitor I had in town. I've been trying to put him out of business for years. Where'd you work before? - Work? - Come on, lady. You are a professional. Where'd you work last? - (laughs) Work? Poker isn't work for me. Poker is a pure pleasure. - And one more question. - You wanna know whether I'm a shark. - I don't like 53 card decks because I don't run the kind of place where you need hip boots to wade through the dead and wounded. It's kinda bad for the carriage trade. - Carriage trade. If you had a carriage trade in this cultural desert you call a town, you couldn't get them into this saloon if you served them water from the fountain of youth. But since it's apparently preying on your mind, I'll tell you. I've never shaved a deck. I've never marked an ace. I don't deal from the bottom and I have never double discarded. When I sit in a poker game I don't cast shadows. I'm too good to cheat. Now is that anything else, Mr. Sears? - Yeah, two things. The first thing, don't ever take a cigar out of my hand again. (cigar clatters) - And the second thing? - I'll give you a thousand dollars for your house. - My house is worth $3,000 and that's what you can have it for. - It's worth a thousand because I'm the only game in town and I put out the word, lady, you will find no more takers. - Oh, Mr. Sears. (laughs) You should never have sat in this game because there is no way in this world that I am going to let you win. (footsteps clicking) (gentle music) (people chattering) (door slams) - Alice Moffit, professional gambler. Now that is gonna take some getting used to. (laughs) Can I buy a drink? Two of your best. (chairs clattering) Saw you playing earlier. I didn't think you recognized me. - Oh, I recognized you. - You almost made me feel bad. You didn't return my smile. Here you go. - Only a loser smiles at a poker table. I was holding four of a kind (Jeremy laughs) and that's no time for levity. - Well, you still owe me a smile. - (laughs) How's that? - That's just fine. What are you doing for the next 30 or 40 years? - Hopefully avoiding strange men spouting all too familiar lines. - I'm not exactly a stranger now. We did spend a whole night together. I mean it was a curtain between us, of course, but uh... - I uh, think I should be going. - Can I see you to your room? - Well I, I need to go to my bordello first. - Your what? - My bordello. - Ah. (gentle music) - Cousin John seems to have retired. It's very late. Would you mind terribly accompanying me there? - To the bordello. - Yes. I- I'll explain it to you. - (laughs) I hope so. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (door clatters) (footsteps clicking) (door slams) - What is your name? - Big Irma. - Uh, Big Irma would you be so kind as to ask the ladies to come down? - But they're asleep. - Well, I don't really care what they're doing. Just get them. Thank you. (cloth rustling) - Hello, Jeremy. - Hi, Irma. (laughs) - Know her well? - Oh, it's a small town. - (laughs) Aren't they all? - [Big Irma] Come on, girls. She wants to talk to all of us. (ladies chattering) I don't know what she's done heard about. I don't know what she wants, come on. You sweet thing. - (laughs) Well, Jeremy. - Why, what you- - There it is. - Oh. - Hello Jeremy. (laughs) - Jeremy. - Will you please take a seat? (chairs creaking) Well, there are going to be some changes made around here. Some rules made. The first rule is no men will go upstairs on Sundays. Is that understood? - Uh, Sunday's one of our busiest days. - This is my house now and I'm telling you, no man will go upstairs on Sunday. - What'll we do? - Well, you might try reading the Bible. That's what Sundays are for. (Baby Doe giggles) - Shh! - You better improve the split if we're gonna lose Sundays to Bible reading. - Oh, that's another thing. There will be no split. Whatever you make you keep. I don't want anything. - Do you mean that? - I mean everything I say, Baby Doe. - Wait 'til old Sears hears about this. - That's precisely what I am waiting for. - Nobody here's got no Bible. (clock ticking) - Well, you do now. (Bible clatters) - What are you? A saint? - I'm a poker player and it's my deal. - (laughs) You ain't dealing me nothing. - If you don't like the game you can go to another table. Goodnight, ladies. (gentle music) (door slams) Well, do you still wanna spend the next 30 or 40 years with me? - Well, you'll sure make time fly colorful. (Alice laughs) Something tells me all that was just your way of trying to put me off. - No, just my way of letting you know who I am. You know what they say, "No illusions. No regret." - Hm. Tell me something. That man you're with, is that really your cousin? - Yes, John really is my cousin. We grew up together. He looked after me. I looked after him. As children we were inseparable. - Well, (sighs) I can understand that as children but uh- - What you can't understand is why we're still together. - Mm-hmm. - I can't explain it. We always have been and we still are. It's as simple as that really. (footsteps clacking) (hooves clopping) (dramatic music) (panting) They weren't who you thought they were. - No. They often come like that out of the dark. - Who? - Any of the breed I hunt. - Do you have to live like this? - If I want to live, yes. (gentle music) Will you come to dinner with me tomorrow night? - Yes. - I mean just the two of us. No cousin John. - John won't like it but yes I will. (sensual music) - May I kiss you? - I don't like men who ask. (sensual music) (lips smack) (romantic music) (romantic music continues) - Alice. (birds chirping) Alice, wake up. (footsteps pounding) We have less than an hour before our train leaves. - Mm. What time is it? - Our train is leaving in less than an hour. If you don't hurry, we're going to miss it. - I'm not taking it. - You're not what? (Alice sighs) It sounded like you said you're not taking it. - Oh, that's, that is what I said. - You can't be serious. Why aren't we? - Because I have a house to sell. Remember? - You are serious. You're gonna let that sin palace keep you in this revolting town? - Well, what would you have me do? Just walk away and leave $3,000 just sitting here. - Why not? - Because it would make me a loser. (person knocking) - Who is it? - John, be an angel and let Mr. Sears in. - Who? - Mr. Sears has come to raise. (footsteps clattering) (door creaks and slams) - What do you think you're doing? I wasn't out of bed five minutes this morning before all the girls in my place start complaining. "Poker Alice ain't taking a cut," I hear that. "Poker Alice ain't gonna open on Sunday," I hear that too. All that I hear before I've had my morning brandy. I almost vomited. - Charming. (footsteps clacking) It's very simple, Mr. Sears. All you do is buy me out. - Yeah, yeah. That's what I figured you'd say. (paper rustling) There's your 2000. Count it. - If it's 2000, it's 2000 short. Raise two and it's a deal. - Say that again. - My house is more valuable today than it was yesterday. I'll sell it to you for 4,000. - You're a rat. (paper crinkling) You're a rat, lady. I wouldn't give you $4,000 for the Chicago stockyards. Somebody else maybe, but not you. (paper crinkling) (door slams) (luggage clattering) - You can stay if you like, Alice. I'm going. Not enough money in the world to induce me to remain here another day. I can't believe you're staying. I just can't believe it. Well, when do you think you'll be coming to New Orleans? - I don't know, John. - It's not the house. You could have just sold it for $2,000 and gotten on the train with me. It's him. He's the reason you're not going. Well I'm leaving, Alice. Before I go, I have something to tell you. You are falling. - (laughs) I haven't the vaguest notion of what you're talking about. - Gambling with the landed gentry in New Orleans salons is one thing, but gambling with the riffraff in a hole like this is quite another. And now you own a bordello which makes you madam as it were. And is if that weren't enough- - John, I warn you. You're treading on very thin ice. - You've once again taken up with a man you don't know any more about than you knew about the last one. - What business is that of yours? What business has it ever been? - My business or not I can't stand by and just watch it happen. - Well then, why don't you go somewhere? - I am. - You always say that and you always stay and I know why. It's because you're incapable of doing anything else. - I can write. - You keep saying that, too. If you wanna know the truth, I think you are afraid to finish the novel. Afraid to find out if you are any good. Maybe you don't have it, John. - You don't mean that. - I've never meant anything more in my entire life. A writer writes. You don't. You must be a terrible disappointment to yourself. You call me a madam. A madam is at least something. You're, you're nothing. (luggage clattering) - Then if I'm nothing I have nothing to be ashamed of. - Can it be that your thinking is so warped that being nothing is a cause for pride? - I'd hate to think I wasted a lifetime on you. - Even if you'd never heard of me you'd have wasted your life on something. (dramatic music) - Maybe. I'm leaving, Alice. You'll never see me again. - Never is a very long time. (dramatic music) (door slams) (people chattering) (glasses clinking) (dramatic music continues) - I need a ride there, partner. (upbeat music) (people chattering) (glasses clattering) - I'll raise you 10 more. - I have something to say to you. - Well? - I'm trying to find a civilized way to say it. - I'm calling. - Say what? - You are the lowest thing that crawls on the face of the earth. - Well that pretty well sums it up, wouldn't you say? - A bounty hunter's nothing but a common murderer. - Four over here. Right over here. - Anything else? - The dregs of lower class society. - Are you through? - What I'm trying to say to you is you don't deserve Alice. - Well she's a big girl. I think she can make up her mind about that. - Father disowned her for gambling, for scandalizing his very proper Bostonian family. He couldn't have loved her very much, could he? I do love her in a very special way and I'll not see her hurt. (upbeat music) (people chattering) That's all I have to say on this matter. - Thanks for the advice, cousin John. - Whiskey. - Coming right up, for you. - Coming right up. - And I'm gonna raise you another five. (people chattering) (driver shouts) (cart clatters) (people chattering) - Uh-huh. I'm real glad to see you. You feeling better? Good. (cart clattering) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (ladies laughing) - Hey, how you like the new boss? Does she make you work any harder? - Don't worry, we'll take care of cousin Alice. (ladies laughing) (door slams) (birds chirping) - Apparently never isn't too terribly long after all. - You know my word is as unreliable as my writing. I can't leave you here alone. There's a decidedly unsavory element in this town and I'm determined to save you from it. - (laughs) I thought according to you I was it. - You know better than to take my ranting seriously. - I accept your apology. Please accept mine. I was very cruel. Cousin John. Come, come sit down with me for a minute. Cousin John, you and I have to part. You know that, don't you? - Because of him? - It has nothing to do with him. It has to do with us. - You would've preferred it if I'd returned to New Orleans without you. - No, I've never preferred to be without you. I've been too selfish. - That's just a nice way of saying you're pushing me off the coach. - Oh, John I- It's the hardest thing I've ever tried to say in my life. - Then don't say it. We can go on just as we always have. - No, we can't. It's not fair to you. I can't have you dragging my suitcases through life anymore. - What if I want to? - I'll stop you. You have to find that there's something bigger and better in this world than being somebody else's cousin. And I want that for myself too. Oh, John. (emotional music) (Alice crying) (mysterious music) (dog howling) (horse nickering) - Now I spent all afternoon on this. I hope you're properly thankful. - You lied to me. - I'm sorry. What? - You told me you were from nowhere. This table tells me you are definitely from somewhere. - Oh, you mean the silver and the china. - I mean the whole thing. - Well, there is a story to that. You see, last year I brought in a, a man into Santa Fe for the reward on him. Now the man who had pledged the reward lost it at the faro table. So I had to settle for his china and his silverware. (liquid splashing) And that's pretty much the whole story. - That may be the whole story about the silver and the China, but it's not the whole story about you. That's the story I'd like to hear. You, you may be working as a bounty hunter, but you aren't one. - Why do you say that? - Well, you know where the knives and forks go. (both laughing) (glasses clinking) - Go. Go inside. - No, I said I was gonna go over there. - Go. Hurry. Go. - [Gilmore] We shouldn't waste no time so while you're looking for him I'll look for a funeral parlor. (hooves clopping) - [JD] When did you start to get so yellow, Gilmore? - [Gilmore] About the time I start hanging around with you. - Oh. That way. (hooves clopping) (gentle music) - And we had 3000 acres of cotton planted in the Mississippi Delta. My father was killed at Vicksburg and mother died soon after that. And when I went home, there was nothing left. Not even a barn. They burned it all and the government was taking the land for taxes. So I headed west. I won't go back. It's all passed. - And your future is in California? - If there's anything I know and care about, its fine horses. - Have you ever been back? - (laughs) No. You? - No. Sometimes I... Sometimes I feel as if I am. - Cousin John. - Dear, dear cousin John. (sentimental music) (chair clattering) (fire crackling) - I don't want to take you back to your hotel tonight. I want you to stay here. - You're direct. I like that. I'll stay. And I want you to know I no longer take a man or a card anything but seriously. I no longer play just to be played. - You play to win. - That's all that counts. I'll sit in on a game for the rest of my life if it's honest and the stakes are right. (romantic music) (lips smacking) (birds chirping) - Good morning. - Morning. - Would you like some coffee? - Yeah. (pitcher clattering) - Well, so far no illusions and believe me, no regrets. (water splashing) You know I've known little ladies who flutter fans in their faces and worry about their pie crusts and lost ladies who make the living in the dark. I've have never met a woman like you before. Strong enough to meet a man face to face and still be a woman. - Maybe you just haven't looked in the right places. - Just everywhere, every day of my life. Well that stops here now. (lips smack) I've decided you're gonna like it in California. - Oh? - It's an honest game. The stakes are right. That's the only kind of game you sit in, isn't it? - The only kind. - There is one thing, though. If you're interested. - If I wasn't interested I wouldn't be here in the first place. - There is no place in my plans for cousin John. (dramatic music) - For so long John has been the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night. It'll be strange to be without him. - Does that mean you go with me to California? (gentle music) - You just try and leave without me. (gentle music) (lips smack) (bell chimes) (Alice gasps) - What? - Oh my God, it's Sunday. (mysterious music) - She said we have to read it. I'm afraid to open it. - Well it ain't gonna bite you. - Then you do it. - Hell, I can't read. - Me neither. (Bible clatters) (ladies sigh) (door clatters) - What's wrong? What is it? - Baby Doe's the only one of us who can read and she's afraid to. - It's been so long and, and I've been so wicked. (Big Irma spits) - There were four of you. Where's Mad Mary? Answer me. (footsteps clattering) (door creaks) (door creaks) (knocks) Open this door. (slams) I said open this door. (lock clicks) You. (dramatic music) You. - You, you know it's Sunday. - Yeah, I know it's Sunday. - You know the rules. - Yeah, and I'll do what I damn please. - Not in my house, you won't. - In your house, in anybody's house, on any day. - Why, you... There's a Bible waiting for you downstairs. - Sister, you know what you can do with that Bible. (Alice slaps) (Mad Mary slaps) (Alice smacks) (both grunting) (energetic music) (both shouting) - In the beginning (both shouting) God created- (both grunting) (vase clattering) And the Earth. - I'm gonna kill you. (Mad Mary growling) - This was upon the face of the deep. (both shouting) And God said, "Let us make men in our image, (both shouting) after our likeness (both shouting and clattering) and let them have denomination over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air (Alice slaps) (Mad Mary shouts) and over the cattle." - (panting) I said not on Sunday. You pack your things and get out. (footsteps pattering) (Alice panting) (door clatters) (door slams) - You know what's doing over at my place? Nothing's doing. Nothing. Used to be I made more on Sunday than all the days put together. What kind of filthy person are you that'd use the Lord's day for extortion? (birds chirping) 2,500. - 4,000. - Three. I tell you what, I will give you 3,500. - 4,000. Tomorrow it'll be 5,000. Next week, 6,000. The week after that, 7,000. - All right, all right, all right, all right. (money rustling) (money rustling) (Sears grunts) (door slams) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (hooves clopping) - Whoa! (horse nickering) - You missed a snap. You always miss a snap and your bag flies open. Can't believe you're leaving me. - Don't, John. - Feel as if I don't know you, as if I never knew you at all. - How are you ever gonna finish your novel if you keep wasting your best material on me? - You don't take me seriously. Not even at a time like this. - Oh, John. This is going to be the most exciting time of our life. I'm going to California to, to marry a man I, I'd almost despaired of ever finding. And you are going to New Orleans to fulfill yourself as a writer. You are good, John. You just have to be away from me to finish what you started. - I'll end up drunk in some bordello staring at a blank page. And you'll be stranded in California in a depot, waiting for the next train to nowhere with your dainties scattered all over the ground. - So long you've urged me to make plans, have intentions. And now that I do you, you curse my future. Both our futures. - I'd never do that. (birds chirping) - Then give us your blessings and say, "Goodbye." - I can't do that. (melancholic music) - Then I'll do it for both of us. Bye, John. God bless you. I'll never be more than a heartbeat away from you. (visitor knocking) - Order for your bags, ma'am. (luggage clattering) (Jeremy grunting) I'll take good care of her, John. (birds chirping) (footsteps clattering) (melancholic music) - Please be happy for me. (melancholic music) Please. Just a little smile. (melancholic music) (lips smack) (horses neighing) (hooves clopping) (horse neighing) (people chattering) (lips smack) (birds chirping) (horses neighing) - Collins. (dramatic music) No more long treks in the night, Collins. No more riding through the keen breaks in the willows. - Jeremy. (suspenseful music) - Better move away from the lady if you don't want her catchin' a stray. Stay where you are, lady. Can see everything from up there. (suspenseful music) (gunshots blast) (bandits grunting) (horse neighing) (footsteps skitter) (Charlie grunts) - Collins, you ain't gonna just leave 'em laying here, are you? - Consider them delivered, Charlie. (birds chirping) When that reward money gets here it belongs to cousin John. (dramatic music) (joyful music) (cart clattering) (joyful music continues) (gentle music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music cotinus) (gentle music) (triumphant music)
