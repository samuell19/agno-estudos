Mum loves the ocean. She always has. Mum met Dad on the beach when they were teenagers. They've been together ever since. That's me when I was four. Rueben's my middle brother. He's always been annoying. And then Oli. Lucky last. And that's us. The Blooms. Everything was pretty much perfect. But then last year happened. Come on. - You're it, Oli. - No, I'm not. Come back! - You can't catch me. - Gotcha! Us kids wanted to go to Disneyland. But Mum and Dad chose Thailand instead. I liked Thailand. Mum! - Oh no! - Oh no! Come on. Let's go! - Here you go. - Thank you. Go away! - Quick, quick, quick. Come on, Roo! - Here we go. Yeah! Whoo! Come on, Mum. Sammy. Mum! - But I hate last year. - Sam! Sam! Hey, boys. - Come on! - Boys! I wanna go! Boys, I've told you about this. Roo! Stop playing, please. Please. Rueben or Oli, can you go and see if Mum is okay? - I did it yesterday. - I did it the day before. - Yeah, yeah, you're overworked. - Noah should do it. It doesn't matter who did it yesterday or the day before. I'm just asking you to check on Mum, please. Why can't Noah do it? - Where is Noah? - He's on the roof in his chair. Uniforms. Pants… pants off, uniforms on. - Stop it! - I'll have a whole-grain sandwich. Noah! He's upstairs? Noah? - I… I bet he isn't, only you. - Noah? A bit of help down here. 'Kay. Help, boys. Boys, come on. Mum was pretty scared in the hospital. But at least there, she wasn't the only one stuck in bed. - Hang on, Sam. - It's okay. - Okay? - I'm fine. Mum broke her back at what the doctors call T6… …but what Mum calls her bra strap. She can't feel anything from there down. That catheter's staying in. I'll just get this out. Except when she has the hiccups. Dad, there's no more milk! I'm okay. Noah drank it all. Can you close the door, please? Oh, and we're ready to go. Is this gonna hurt again? Hmm, not if you land properly. Oh! Are you okay? Watch yourself. Come on, Roo. I've asked you not to do that already. Can you move this please, Roo? - Look, move that for your mum. - Noah? Turn the TV off. Mum, I can't do my laces. Um… Dad knows how to tie the best knots. - Can I go to Kai's after school? - Not today. - Why not? - Out, you lot. Go. Oh, shit. Hey, it's fine. Can we buy our own lunches today? It's Friday. - Can I get a pie? - Ooh, can I get a sausage roll? Yeah, of course you can. - Yes! - Mmm! You've only been home a little while. It will get better. I promise. Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late. I'm sorry, Sam. I love you. I'll call you after drop-off. Give us a kiss before you go. Bye, Mum. - Bye, sweetie. Have a good day. - Bye, Mum. - Hey, boys. Come on, hurry. - Take this off before you go to school. Go, go, go, go, everybody. - Bye, Noah. - Bags the front. Listen, guys! Hey! Do not fight, you two! - I'm the oldest. - You're always the oldest. - Duh! - You're in the back, Noah. Now, a quick look at today's local surfing breaks. Light westerly winds are bringing fantastic surfing conditions with waves around one to two meters. Conditions will be better in the morning as ground swell mixed with those offshore winds should bring well-formed waves that break cleanly. So, if you can make the most of it, you'll have a cracking morning. Looking further ahead at another fine day tomorrow… Coo-ee! Only me! Hello, darling. Hi. What are you doing sitting here in the dark? Nothing. You need some light and fresh air in here. Hmm, why don't you take your book out onto the lawn? Or do your exercises. Remember what the doctor in rehab said. You've gotta keep your spirits up. Yeah. Or try one of those podcast thingies. I bumped into Bron in the supermarket, and she reckons she can be hanging out the washing and solving a murder all at the same time. I'd love to have a special lunch when Kylie gets back. Sorry? What did you say, darling? I didn't say anything. Oh, thought you did. Didn't Cam change these sheets? Just leave them, please, Mum. Oh dear. What's this? Well done. Well, it fits over here. - A cool cubby… - Great. One of my speakers there. Hey. Hello. Are you okay? Maybe you should've left it there. She would have died, Mum. She fell a long way. Let's keep her fluids up in the meantime. I just think it'd be better off at the vet. Is it a boy or a girl, do you think? Well, says here a magpie's gender can't be determined until after a year. So, we don't know. - It's a girl. - How do you know? Well, I just do. Well, she needs a name. No, Cam. No names, please. Got enough to worry about around here. Penguin. Penguin? Why? 'Cause she's black and white. Oh, okay. - How about… Zebra? - Skunk? - Panda? - Panda's good. No, how about Magician's Wand? - Chessboard. - How about Soccer Ball? Tuxedo? - Very good. - Penguin. Her name's… Penguin. It's all right, Penguin. Shh. Sometimes it's hard to believe what happened. It's like Mum was stolen from us. She used to surf with us, skate with us, play soccer in the sand with us. She was awesome. Come on. Whoo! Let's go! Come on! Look, Peng. Look at me. Funny, Peng. Oh, wait. Did she just poo on you? She needs a nappy. You do. No, you do. For your farts. I don't mind. Hey, Peng. This is how you fly. - Don't! - Woo-hoo! Flying. Ignore him, Peng. You try, Noah, you chicken. Can you feel this? Can you feel this? No. That's cool, like a superpower. Mum? Penguin's talking to you. What? Why don't you like her? She's a wild bird, which means she can't stay here forever. Right? Come on, Peng. You've gotta get your strength back. She obviously doesn't like it, Noah. She should. I made it like they said online, with bugs and stuff. Why don't you try it? See what it tastes like then? Shut up, Rueben. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. - Hey, Dad. Hi, Dad. It was supposed to be a normal family portrait. Turns out they all hate each other's guts. And mine too, apparently, so that was a bit of fun. Hey. How are you? How's the pain? One to ten? I'm fine. And you? - G'day, gorgeous. - Aw. - Gesundheit. - She sneeze? Okay, so look, I was thinking we could have fish and chips for dinner. Eat on the beach? - Can I bring Peng? - Of course you can bring Penguin. I could carry you, Sam. No. It's beautiful down there. Come on. No. You guys go. I'm… I'm gonna get ready for bed. - Come on, Mum. - It's too early for bed, Sam. Please, Mum? Sorry, bub. Hey, bring me back a shell, okay? - Hey. Come on. Let's go. - I bet I can beat you. - I'll race you to the bedroom. - Towels, togs, let's rock! - Oli, come on. - Yes. Never ask me that question in front of the boys again. What question? How am I? I don't wanna have to lie to them. Dad, where are my swimmers? Okay. Don't. Do you miss your mum? Oli. Give this shell to Mum. Thanks, Noah. Hey, Peng. Come and watch this. This is delicious, Dad. Come on, Peng. Why don't you have one, Peng? - Want one, Peng? - Want a bit of fish? Or a yummy chip, Peng? - That's not the right one. - She's a magpie, not a seagull. Come on, girl. Eat some oyster. What are you doing, Peng? Good girl. Dad? Dad? Roo? Cam, babe. It's Rueben. Something's up. You okay? Oh God! Oh, no, no. Smells like oysters. Cam? Is he okay? It's all right. You're okay. You're okay. Penguin nearly ate one of those. - Never again. - You could've poisoned her. Get back, Snow, or you'll step in it. Hey, you're gonna be all right. Sorry, Dad. Are you okay, Oli? Now it's all out, you'll feel better. It's all right. That's it. There you go. You've still got a little bit more there. I spewed in my bed, too. Get back. Get back. Okay. It's all right. You're okay. Ah, they're fine. I think it was just the dodgy oyster. Look, we should turn while you're awake. Hey. Sam? Hey, what's up? They're fine. They used to call out for me. They didn't mean anything by it. Hey. What am I if I can't even be a mum? You are. - No, I'm not. I'm nothing. - You are. Shh. I hate this. I just hate it so much. I hate myself so much. No! No! Over 20 million people holiday in Thailand every year. That's 20 million other people this could have happened to. That's 40 million other hands that could have touched that fence. A fence that was 15 years old. 5,475 other days it could have broken. But it waited for Mum. Boys, hurry! Come. This way. Come on. She'll be fine. She'll be fine. She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. Come on, Mum. Look what I found. Coming. And I'm the one who took her there. - Mum! - Sam? Sam. Sam! Call an ambulance. Sam! I just had the most awful dream. I was drowning. But it felt good. Please. Look at me. I'm here. I'm here for you. It's not enough. I'm sorry, Cam. Even the boys. Even they're not enough. - Hey... - Just go. Let me get you up into the shower. - No, I just wanna stay... - You need to get up. It'll pass. Just... No, I'm fine. I'm just… Just wanna stay here. Please. Just get the kids to school. - Fish does stink a bit. - Boys, bags. Let's go. Bye, Peng. Bye, Peng. That was like a swimming pool of spew, Dad. Yeah, a spew river. Mum? Yeah? Can you look after Penguin for me? She's still not eating very well. Okay. Come on, Noah. Bye, Peng. Please. Shut up! Shut up! Shh. Fine, don't eat it then. Bird? Bugger. Hey, leave that alone. Where have you gone? Come on. Come on. Out you come. Come on. Get off it. Okay, hold on. Now where's she gone? Bird? Penguin? Oh, come here. Ugh, come on. Come here. Oh no. Oh, little one. Little one. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's okay. Sammy? Shh, shh, shh. Ah, this is really good, Mum. Thanks, Roo. New recipe? - Bron brought it over. - She should bring more food over. - How was she? - Mmm. How was school today, Oli? Uh, I saw Danny McCoy, um, stand on that thing under the play equipment, and then when two little kids jumped down, he grabbed them by their undies, pulled their undies over their, um, faces… …up behind him, and it was, like, "Hey," and pushed him in too. - What do you call that? - What is that technique? - Wedgie. Okay. - An atomic wedgie. Hey, that's my Mr. Murphy! But she likes him. Look at Peng. - What are you up to? - With Mr. Murphy. Why does she like Mr. Murphy? And there's Mr. Murphy. They're so cute. Ooh, lovers. Can she stay? - Please, Mum, can she? - Please. - Come on, Mum. - She's just a little bird. Just until she gets strong enough. Yes! She doesn't wanna be stuck inside, does she? I'll race you. No, you won't. I read that baby birds dream of their mother's song. And that's how they learn to sing. I wonder if they dream of their mothers teaching them to fly too. Penguin got stronger and fatter… Almost there, Peng. …but couldn't seem to fly. Maybe 'cause we didn't. Penguin, stop it. Look, Peng, it's the bird magnet. Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum. - This is pretty good. - Yum. Mmm. Want some, Penguin? Want some, girl? Must be weird to have wings and not be able to fly. Hey, hey, hey. Hello, Roo. Hi. G'day, stranger. Hi, Aunty Kylie. - Hi, Nan Jan. - Nan Jan, watch this! Okay. Now jump and bounce over here. Go! Go! Whoo! - You're looking good. - Yeah, it was pretty amazing. I just did lots of yoga. I didn't speak to anyone for weeks. I didn't drink anything. We should get Mum to go. Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. How about I put some coffee on? Do you need anything? No, I'm fine. Thanks, Mum. What about some cheese and bikkies? It's all good. Nuts? Okay, great. That sounds perfect. - Are you cross with me? - No. Why would I be cross with you? I'm the one who told you to go. So… I would kill for a glass of wine. - When was the last time you went out? - I go out. Yeah? Where? And not to the doctor's. I mean, when was the last time you just went out? So, what do you say? Let's go for lunch. That would do us a world of good. Come on, Sammy. Why is he even parking there? - He's not even handicapped. - I know. Can we please not park here? What? No, Cam gave me a sticker, Sam. - I don't want to use that. - It's convenient, darling. - It doesn't mean that... - I don't care, Mum. You're not a spastic. - No one thinks that. - Oh my God. I wasn't saying that. - Mum! Never ever! - You can't say that word. That was the correct term. I had a cousin who was a spastic. - Oh my God. - Mary, you remember her. - Please. I... - She had lovely red hair. No, I'll get the chair. I'll get the chair. You okay? You okay, darling? Oh, careful. - It's all right. - You all right? - Thank you. - Great, thank you. So, what do you feel like, sweetheart? You've gotta have a glass of wine. - We should share a bottle. - Maybe a nice... - Let's do that. - Oh, hi! Bron! - Sam? - Hi. - Hi, Bron. - Hi. Sam, hi. Hi. How are you? - Yeah, good. - Oh, I know. I'm sorry, a silly question. - No, it's okay. - Came up to see you the other day. Oh yeah, right. Thanks, um… thanks for the flowers. Kids loved the lasagne. - Uh, I was at the physio. - Yeah. Yeah. No, it's okay. I get it. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here and whatever you need, I'm… you know. Maybe see you in a few weeks, yeah. What are you up to, Bron? - Oh yeah. - Oh. Same old, same old. Um, back on ward 20 in the hospital. Yeah. Kids' school fundraiser's coming up. That's about as exciting as it gets. Um… I'm just hanging out for Christmas. We'll head back up to Noosa. Lasagna. - Yeah, lasagne. - Lasagna. Yes. - See what Mum wants first. - Ice cream. Boys, jump in the shower. Has Mum gone crazy? Shut up, Rueben. All those things we did. Yeah, no, I… I get it. That you want… that you want to… …erase yourself. Who you were. But you're still you, Sam. - No, I'm not. That's the point. - You are. - You are. You are. You are! - I'm not. I'm not. That is someone else. I'm nothing. This... It doesn't work. It just doesn't work! Look at me, Cam. Nearly there. One more. Come on, Noah. There it is! Ta-da. Cam. There you go. Come on, Noah. You wanna go outside? Go on. Give it a go. Next time. Maybe we should try something different. What do you mean? Are you serious? You love the water. You don't get it. What are you scared of? The worst that can happen is you'll be embarrassed. - Hey, Peng. - But at least you tried. How about another thing to make me feel useless? So, what do you need, Sam? 'Cause I'm running out of ideas. The boys and I, we're struggling. Oh, you're struggling? Yes, it's all of us, Sam. No, it's not! Just tell me what you want. Uh, anything but this. - I wanna walk the boys to school. - Let's go for a skate. I wanna get dressed by myself. I want a day without pain. Hey. Will one of you please clean up this mess? Shush, Peng. Mum! Okay. Thanks, bud. No, don't lift me. Just fix my legs. Oh, I'll get Dad. It's okay. No. Just let me help you. Just give me a sec. Just go slow. Just pull the chair. - Can you grab that pillow? - Yeah. Okay. That's it, babe. That's it. You got it. You're good. Here, I'll just move this. Go, please. Okay. Whoa! Peng! Go, Peng! - Whoo! - Dad, look! - Go, Peng! - Look! Go, Peng! - Go! - Peng! Sammy! Sam! - Let's go, Peng. - Let's go. Woo-hoo! Sam! I'm okay. It's fine. You're not missing this. - Is she flying? - Yeah. You wait. - Yeah, go, Peng! - Go, Peng! - Peng, you can do it! - Yeah! Whoo! - Go, Peng! - Yes, Peng! Knew you could do it! Go, Peng! - Go on, Peng! - Woo-hoo! - Woo-hoo! - Let's go, Peng! - Let's go! - Go, Peng! - Let's go! Yeah! - Yes! - Yeah! - Good one! Hello. You must be the Blooms. I'm Gaye. - Cameron. We spoke on the phone. - Uh-huh. Cameron tells me you're quite the surfer. Was. And a nurse. And a mum. By the looks of these jokers, it couldn't have been a walk in the park. You seem a bit nervous. I'm in a wheelchair. Well, wouldn't you rather be in a kayak? Right. You hold the front. I'll take the back. And, uh, pass the paddle to Sam, please. Yep. Okay, pull it out. So I want you to practice paddling. Gentle hands, Cam. Jeez, he goes in strong, doesn't he? Okay, so I want you to think about it like it's swimming, except you're gonna scoop the water with the paddle instead of your hands. Try and feel it on the blade until you get a good catch. Yeah. Eyes straight ahead. You look to the side, you'll lean to the side. Right. Yeah, flick it off at the side at the waist. Good. That's it. The more comfortable you are, the quicker you'll go. Relax and breathe. - You're doing great, Mum! - Looking a bit tense there, Sam. Okay. Okay. Now we've come to the most important part of the lesson. I want you to tip over. - What? - You heard me. Get in there. No way. What's the worst thing that can happen? You swim, don't you? You still have your arms. They must be good for something. Come on, it's like riding a bike. I can't do that either. Don't make me tip you out, Sam. You wouldn't. Oh, I tip people all the time. I'm known for it. I can't. Can't do it. This is the easy part. This is falling off the bike. I said I can't! - Three, two, one. - Three, two, one. - Hey, remember that time we went... - Yeah! It'll soon be time for you to move out of home, girl or start paying rent. You were incredible today. Gaye thinks you've got talent. Hey, thanks for pushing me. And I'm sorry you have to live with this. Are you kidding? I consider myself the luckiest man alive. Oh, shut up. How so? Because for a night… I sat thinking I'd never see you again. But I did. I do, every day. So… so… I've been reading up on magpies. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah. Turns out they mate for life. Really? Totally monogamous. One and only. They find their soul mate, and game... - You are… - Game over. It's game over. Well, maybe that explains why they're so miserable and angry all the time. - What is wrong with you? - You! What's wrong with you? - You are such a cheeseball. - You're crazy. Crazy. Hey, hey, Peng. Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! - Oh! - Oh my, look at all of this. - Here we go. Aw, thank you. Peng, my Peng. "Get that bloody bird out of the house"? I didn't say that, did I? - Budge up. - Don't listen to him. - Let me in. - Three, two, and open fire! Hey, wait. I'm in charge. I'm in charge. - Shrunk quite a bit, Mum. - I reckon. I think we have got it. What about you, Oli? With high heels. - Oh, you cheater. - Cheater. Don't forget Penguin. Come on, Peng. Maybe I can get a… - So, where is it again? Here? - Mm-hmm. Mum loves the ocean. She always has. - Mum met Dad... - Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. It's just a thing. What sort of thing? I… I can pack these up. Do you need any… I mean, I can help if you like. No. It's fine. I'll pack them up. Coming. Coming Hi, Nan Jan. Hi. - Hey, Nan. - Hello. Hi. Oh, you brought Penguin. How nice. - Hi, Mum. - Hello, sweetheart. Happy birthday. Thank you. - Quickly, quickly, carry. - Hurry. Come on. - Hide them, quick. - Come on. Thanks, Kyles. Oh, Sammy, you're so old. Uh, I'll wear it well. And I got you bubbles, but I got... Look, I got the cheap stuff 'cause you can't taste it. - Oh great. Thanks. Keep it coming. - Yeah. Love you. I love you. Kylie! This table isn't gonna set itself. Come on. - Okay. Okay, Mum. - And use the good napkins. I have waited over a year for this. Thanks, Mum. Oh no. Oh, I swear that bird does it to me just to annoy me. - Sorry, Mum. - I'll get it. - Thanks, Roo. - Do you have to be inside? She didn't mean to. - Shoo, shoo! Shoo! - That'll be Gaye. Sometimes she thinks toes are worms. Oh! Sorry. Sorry, Jan. - So, Gaye, you reckon Sam's got a shot? - Oh yeah. So, she'll be spending a lot of time in the water? Yeah, training three times a week. It sounds dangerous. And Sam can't swim, can you? Don't you worry, Jan. I haven't drowned a student yet. But my ex-husband, well… that's a whole other story. You know, um, my… my students, they… they usually take a long time to find their balance… There you go, Peng, some fresh air. …took to it like a duck to the water, this one. Honestly, it's the first time I've felt normal since the accident. When I'm kayaking, I look like everyone else. Well, thank goodness for Gaye. Someone's gotta get Sam out of the house, be proactive. Mum, please. Mum, what... That's what Cameron does every day. - I wasn't saying that. - Mm-hmm. I didn't mean that, Cam. - I know. - All I'm saying is it's very hard. You've got your work. Sam's often alone. She likes her independence, Jan. - But she can't walk. - God. I'm right here, Mum. How much independence should she have? - Mum, I'm three feet away from you. - No, really. Please. - What if something awful happened? - Oh God, Mum. She has her phone, Jan. She'd call. Yeah, what if she fell or there was a fire? Hey, boys! Um, how about you go jump in the pool? - Take your plates. - Oh, it was just getting fun. - Will we still get cake? - Of course we will, ding-dong. - It's chocolate. - Don't call me a ding-dong. What if she couldn't reach her phone? - Oh my God. - What if it wasn't charged? We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan. We live our life. - Cam, don't. - Oh yes. All fun and no responsibility. Look where that's got you. - I might, uh, go for a swim as well. - Please sit down, Gaye. - It's fine. - And, Jan, if you're implying... No, she's not implying. It's just… Leave her alone. She's drunk and emotional. I heard that. Well, yes, of course. You're three feet away, Mum. - When your poor father died... - Oh. - I'm just... Okay. - Sit, please. No, no, please. May as well stay. When your poor father died, I thought, at least I've still got the girls. But now I just lie awake at night worrying. And I don't? All I ever do is worry. I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam or too sad in front of the boys. I worry if I should take them to the beach or if that's us being selfish. I worry… I worry if I do too much for Sam or not enough. I know. I worry Sam can't walk because I moved her after she fell. No, darling, that's got nothing to do with it... Believe me, Jan. I worry. I'm sorry, love. I'm just… I'm just scared. I wanna make my little girl well again, and I can't. - And it makes me crazy. I just... - Shh. Well, don't shush me. No, no, no. Shh. - Can you hear that? - What? Is that Penguin? Hey! Hey! Leave her alone! - Oh no! - Penguin! Back up! - Penguin! - Penguin! - Leave her alone! - Hey! - What's happening? - Hey! Penguin! Penguin! Penguin! - Hey! - Dad! Leave her alone, you mongrels. Oh no. No! Penguin! Penguin! No! - Peng! - Penguin! Peng! Come back! Penguin! - Peng! - Peng! Come back! - Penguin! - She went down there. Oh, sweetheart. Come on. Penguin! I knew it. Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you. We're about to head home. There's no point in this weather. Maybe she's at the beach. It's getting dark, Snow. Just five more minutes, please. You're all gonna get sick. Let's give him five more. Go! Go! Penguin! Why did they do it? Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone. Peng! Magpies are territorial, mate. Technically, this isn't Penguin's home. It's theirs. Penguin! But we're her home. I know, sweetheart. I know. Penguin! …other days it could have broken. But it waited for Mum. And I'm the one who took her there. I wish it was me who leant on that fence. I wish it was me who broke my back. Is it New Year's Eve? No. Then why are there fireworks? I don't know. 'Cause sometimes nice things just happen. Are you mad at Noah? 'Cause anyone could've let her out. I know. Penguin! Peng! Penguin! Penguin! Peng! You all right, Snow? Do you think she's dead? Jeez, Roo, no. She's just scared. Give her time to find her way home. She knows where we are. And Penguin's tough. Isn't that right, Sammy? Noah? He's okay. He's just… Noah, it's not your fault. Of course it's not your fault. You've got to stop this. You've gotta let it go. You're not to blame for Penguin, and you're not to blame for my accident. Okay. Okay. Let's not turn this into something it's not. Just... - He thinks he is. Don't you, Noah? - Oh, Sam. Why do we have to talk about this? Because I'm tired of not talking about it. Please don't walk away. You say I'm not to blame, Mum, but you don't mean it. Of course she means it. You don't know anything, Dad. - Hey, hey, that's enough. - You don't see the way she looks at me. - Inside voices, mate... - Oh, shut up, Cam. Please, Noah, if you've got something to say, just say it. Please. I need you to talk to me. It's my fault we went up that tower. It was my idea. I'm the reason you broke your back. You happy? No, I'm not happy. And sometimes I think I'll never be happy again but not because of you. Then why don't you ever wanna talk to me or be near me? - I don't know. I've made lots of mistakes. - You hug Oli all the time. - You can't look at me! - I'm scared. I'm just terrified that all this anger will just come spewing out of me. Not just at you, at all of… all of you. Me too. You, Cam. And I wish… …every day, I wish we'd never gone on that bloody roof! But we went. That was our decision. Not yours. You're not to blame for any of it. I promise. It was just a piece of old, rotten wood. I'm sorry I haven't been strong enough to help you understand that. Or help you through it. I didn't think I was strong enough to get through it myself. But I am. And I know that now. I'm here. I'm your mum. The same mum. Looking good. Bye, Mum. Bye, sweetie. Bye, Mum. See ya. Have a good day, darling. You too. - Finally. - Oh. Okay then. I give up. What's this all about? We're going out. We're not spending another night staring at Penguin's basket. We're going out for fish and chips. And I need a blindfold to go to the beach? Well, who said anything about the beach? Boys. What are you up to? - Oh my gosh. - We've got you. Three, two, one. - Ta-da! - Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-la! It's just Gaye. It is not just Gaye. It's Gaye and Gaye's truck. - Boys, let's go. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Oh, hi, Bron. - Surprise? Don't look at me. No one tells me anything. - What is going on? - One, two, three. Ta-da! Your chariot awaits. Bags having to go after Mum. We're going out for fish and chips. Only if you want to. Okay. Drive! And drive, babies! We did it. - Oh, thank God. - Oh, thank you, guys. - Over here? - Thank you. Yep, just here. Oh, Mama. It's fine. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. That was pretty sneaky. Yeah. Ask me that question. Which question? The one I told you never to ask me. How are you? I'm better. Thank you, Cam. Thank you. Could be another one. It's not. - That's Penguin. - Oh. It's Penguin! - She's back! She's back. - Penguin, Penguin, Penguin! Penguin! Give me kisses. Eye pokes. - Peng. - Peng. Mum's not the person she once was. And I know she's not the person she wanted to be. But to me, she's much more than that. Like this one, Peng? Where are you going? Peng? Peng? What is it? What are you up to? Hey? Thanks.
