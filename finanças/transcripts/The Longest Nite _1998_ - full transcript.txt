Macau is a melting pot of many different gangs A lot of people want to share a piece of it The two major gangs which control... all the illegal activities are led by Mr K. and Mr Lung Mr Lung has been recruiting new member's into his group in the past two years His power has been growing stronger, even wants to take control of all profits Nevertheless Mr K. has been the true leader for more than a decade, his position is undoubtedly strong Even the police and other gang members would pay him respect This two major gangs have been fighting with each other in the past eight months This makes other business to go down The boss who supports these business, Mr Hung is very upset News was spread that he wanted both of them to leave Macau Because of Mr Hung's threat, Mr K. and Mr Lung have to hide themselves Plus they want to join forces, so Mr Hung has no excuse to take them out of the game But at the same time, it is heard that Mr K. has put a 5 million dollars contract on Mr Lung I've already told the others, said you didn't put out a contract to kill Mr Lung But all the assassins kept coming in Five million dollars, who doesn't want it? Could it be Mr Lung who put out the contract? I'm negotiating with him now, I don't think he would do that I think it's Mr Hung Mr Hung? Once we've made the deal, he would no longer have the excuse to touch us So before Mr Lung come back tomorrow night, we can't let any thing to go wrong, especially we can't let Mr Lung die And you need to keep an eye on Mark This brat is so naive, only knows how to use a gun Take it easy, I'll take care of it I've been with Mr K for more than ten years, he can handle anyone I've never seen him like this, he's frightened In the past eight months, he was been very calm even he was standing against Mr Lung They compromise with each other this time, it's just because Mr Lung knew he was gonna lose Everything is going to get resolved tomorrrow night Why do we still need to be afraid of Mr Hung? For an old guy who hasn't been back in Macau for over a decade, what possibly can he do now? If he's as powerful as what people say, I'd like to meet him too How long are you gonna stay for? One night Would you like something? A call girl? No Skipper, this is Tony Tonight at 4:00 am You don't need to recognize me, you just need to show up on time Sir, what would you like to order?
