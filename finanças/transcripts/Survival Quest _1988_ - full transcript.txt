( insects chirping ) Jake: TAKE A GOOD LOOK AROUND YOU. BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM THIS TRIP, NOTHING WILL EVER LOOK THE SAME TO YOU AGAIN. ALL OF THESE TIDDLYWINK LITTLE GAMES WE'VE BEEN PLAYING OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS ARE JUST CHICKENSHIT IN COMPARISON TO WHAT LIES AHEAD OF YOU. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT-- I THINK YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES BECAUSE YOU'VE SHOWN THAT YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT THIS WORLD BELONGS ONLY TO THE STRONG. THE MEEK WILL NEVER INHERIT ANYTHING BUT SHIT. YOU'VE SHOWN THAT YOU'RE A BUNCH OF TOUGH SONS OF BITCHES. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. YOU SEE THAT PLANE OVER THERE? THAT'S YOUR TICKET TO MANHOOD. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR ABILITY, RAIDER, DON'T GET ON IT HERE, BECAUSE... YOU'LL EITHER MAKE IT OR I'LL LEAVE YOUR DEAD CARCASS IN THE WILDERNESS FOR THE BEASTS. OKAY. OKAY! LET'S MOVE. LET'S GO! ( all cheering ) Joey: ARE THEY TAKING A SURVIVAL COURSE TOO? Jeff: NO, THEY'RE FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL CALLED "BLUE LEGION." IT'S RUN BY THIS FAMOUS SURVIVALIST NAMED JAKE CONNOR. THAT'S HIM. - JAKE CONNOR. - LOOK AT THIS GUY. "MERCENARY BETWEEN WARS, HIS RUGGED BLUE LEGION SURVIVAL SCHOOL - TAKES YOUNG MEN INTO THE WILDERNESS... - Jake: YO, COME ON! ...AND TEACHES THEM THAT THE GRADE FOR FAILURE IS DEATH." Joey: OH, GREAT. AND THEY'RE BRINGING GUNS? NO, THEY'RE PELLETS FILLED WITH PAINT. THEY USE THEM FOR THEIR WAR GAMES. - ( snickers ) - WHAT'S THIS FOR? MY GIRLFRIEND GAVE THIS TO ME, JUST IN CASE WE HAPPEN TO RUN INTO ANY GRIZZLIES. HOW WILL YOU GET HOME? THAT HOME IS FOR YOU AND YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND. YOU KNOW, I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SPENT SUCH A BIG CHUNK OF THE SETTLEMENT ON THIS TRIP. IT'S MY LIFE, MARK, YOU KNOW. IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS ANYMORE. NO. ( harrumphs ) DAD, YOU COULD BE USING THIS TIME TO FIND A NEW JOB. YEAH, I KNOW... BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. BUT PEOPLE WHO DO THIS SORT OF THING ARE USUALLY... YOUNG. YEAH. I KNOW. WELL... TAKE CARE, BABY. BE GOOD, SWEETHEART. THANKS FOR THE RIDE, DADDY. GOD DAMN IT, OLIVIA, WHAT IF YOU GET LOST? A GIRL CAN'T SURVIVE IN THE WILDERNESS. ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO TO GET READY FOR THE WEDDING. OLIVIA, SWEETHEART, LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS. IT'S TOUGH TERRAIN OUT THERE. NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE WITH A BROKEN LEG, DO YOU? IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST WHATSOEVER IN MY MAKING AN APPEARANCE AT THAT WEDDING NEXT MONTH, YOU'D BETTER JUST BACK OFF. ( sighs ) I LOVE YOU. COME TO THINK OF IT, JACK, YOU'D BETTER HANG ON TO THIS FOR ME. WOULDN'T WANT TO LOSE IT NOW, WOULD I? ( man wolf-whistles ) - Man: WHOO! ALL RIGHT. - Man #2: NOT BAD. - ( men chuckle ) - TATER TOTS. ( man making kissing noises ) Man: HEY, THE OLD MAN MADE IT UP THE STAIRS. Man #2: HEY, GRAMPS. WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY CRIMINAL GOING TO CAMP. YOU'VE GOT TO SIGN OFF HERE. OKAY, I GOT IT. HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'VE RUN A LOT OF CHARTERS FOR SURVIVAL QUEST. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH KIDS LIKE THIS. HEY... FALL OFF A FUCKING MOUNTAIN. ( men chattering, snickering ) ( truck doors close, engine starts ) Man: HEY, GUYS... I HEARD THAT SURVIVAL QUEST TOOK OLD MEN AND GIRLS, BUT CONVICTS? - SHIT, WHAT A ZOO. - ( men laugh ) ( door creaks ) WELL, SEE YOU GUYS IN FOUR WEEKS. OKAY, MEN, LET'S GO. LET'S MOVE IT OUT. COME ON, LOOK LIKE YOU MEAN IT. ( metal clinking ) JESUS, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO, BLOW US UP? Woman: COME ON, EVERYBODY IN! ( engine dies ) COME ON, YOU GUYS, MOVE IT. DAMN IT, VIC, WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE? WELL, THE DAM BROKE AT THE AIRFIELD AT WINDIGO AND... HANK'S GONNA BE PISSED. COME ON, KAREN, IT'S A BIG WILDERNESS. THEY'LL STAY OUT OF YOUR WAY. WELL, I'M GONNA BE BACK IN 10 MINUTES. Jake: YOU, COME HERE. ARE YOU OUR INSTRUCTOR? NO, YOU'VE DRAWN THE IRON MAN-- HANK CHAMBERS. HE'S THE BEST. TAUGHT AT ALMOST EVERY SURVIVAL QUEST SCHOOL AROUND THE WORLD. THE GUY SPENDS ABOUT 10 MONTHS A YEAR OUT IN THE WILDERNESS. REAL MOUNTAIN MAN, HUH? YEAH, YOU BETCHA. YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE, HE WAS MY INSTRUCTOR. WHO WAS YOUR DRIVING INSTRUCTOR? Karen: OKAY, WE'RE HERE. - YOU GOT IT? - I GOT IT. OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL. MAN... THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. Karen: HERE YOU GO. WELCOME TO SURVIVAL QUEST. I SEE... FIVE... SIX NAMES... AND SIX HEADS, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ROLL CALL. I'M GONNA BE WITH YOU FOR THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS. AND I THINK BEFORE WE INTRODUCE OURSELVES, WE HAVE TO LEARN TO TRUST ONE ANOTHER. LOOK AROUND YOU. THE GUY NEXT TO YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. HEY! - Joey: OH MY GOD. - Hank: I THINK WE GOT A TEAM. - ( engine starts ) - Karen: SEE YOU LATER. I'M HANK, AND YOU'RE NEXT. ( chuckles ) - COME ON. - WHOA WHOA. - WATCH IT. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - HEY, WAIT. NO, I DON'T-- - GET UP ON THE BOX. - UP ON THE BOX. THERE YOU GO. - WAIT, I DON'T-- WAIT A SECOND. THIS IS GOOD. I PRETTY MUCH GET THE IDEA. I WANT YOU TO PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS, STAND UP THERE ON THE EDGE, AND WE'RE GONNA CATCH YOU. JUST TRUST US. WHOA, LISTEN. HEIGHTS SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME. CAN WE PASS THIS ONE UP? NO. SO ANYWAY, THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROGRAM IS TO PUSH BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR FEARS. YOU'VE GOT MORE ABILITIES THAN YOU EVER DREAMT OF. THE ONLY THING HOLDING YOU BACK IS FEAR. SO DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. DO IT. COME ON. COME ON. WE'RE GONNA CATCH YOU. LOOK, JUST STAND UP. STAND UP. PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS. TURN AROUND AND LET GO. JUST RELAX. WE WON'T LET YOU FALL, WILL WE? WILL WE? COME ON, WILL WE? ( all cheering ) Olivia: ALL RIGHT, COME ON. LET'S DO IT. - Hank: WE CAN'T WAIT HERE ALL NIGHT. - Hal: GO FOR IT, JOEY. - COME ON, DO IT. - YEAH, COME ON. WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THE WORK. Jeff: DON'T WORRY, BUDDY. Olivia: OKAY, AHH! ( all laughing ) OH, THAT WAS GREAT. THAT WAS TERRIFIC, REALLY. YEAH. WHERE'S THE BATHROOM? ( all laugh ) OKAY, THIS IS OUR FIRST GROUP PROBLEM. IN THE WILDERNESS, YOU'RE GONNA FACE MANY DIFFICULT MOMENTS THAT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED BY THE GROUP WORKING TOGETHER. IN FACT, LIKE I SAID BEFORE, YOUR LIVES MAY DEPEND ON IT. THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO GET EVERYBODY OVER THE TOP. ONCE OVER THE TOP, YOU CAN'T COME AROUND THE SIDES. ONLY OVER THE TOP. UH, CAN WE USE THE ROPE? NOPE. MUST BE 12-FEET HIGH. Joey: AT LEAST. HOW THE HELL DO WE GET THE LAST GUY OVER? YOU DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. SOUNDS LIKE A TRICK QUESTION TO ME. OKAY. OKAY... WE PUT THE GIRLS OVER FIRST. Joey: YEAH. THEY'RE LIGHT. WE JUST HOIST THEM OVER. LOOK, HAL AND I CAN DO IT. Hal: GOOD IDEA. COME ON, LET'S GO. DON'T WORRY. I THINK WE GOT A WIRE. THEN WHAT? SO YOU GET EVERYBODY OVER EXCEPT THE LAST GUY - WHO'S STILL LEFT HERE... - WAIT, TALLEST GUY GOES LAST. LIKE YOU-- YOU REACH UP, WE'LL BE UP THERE, WE'LL PULL YOU OVER. - IT'S 12 FEET. - NO PROBLEM. YOU'VE GOT LONG ARMS. WAIT WAIT WAIT, WE PUT THE CONVICT OVER LAST. HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? GRAY? YOU GO OVER LAST. HE'S PROBABLY GOOD AT CLIMBING WALLS. OKAY, LET'S GO. GIVE IT A SHOT. ( groaning and arguing outside ) OH, I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME. Hal: GOOD GIRL. - HEY, WAIT WAIT WAIT. - Hal: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. - OKAY. Joey: ALL RIGHT. GOOD JOB. - WHERE'S OLIVIA? - OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL HELP YOU. ( grunts ) JESUS CHRIST. ARE YOU OVER? OKAY. Cheryl: ALL RIGHT. COME ON, SON. YOU'RE UP. ( Hal whistles ) OOH. Hank: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU BRAKE WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND-- BRAKE. THIS IS ONLY A GUIDE HAND, SO DON'T TRY TO BRAKE WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT? EASY, EASY. HEY, COME ON. YOU'RE LIKE AN OLD LADY. WHOA. ( laughs ) THAT'S VERY FUNNY. VERY FUNNY. VERY FUNNY. ( groans ) ( chuckling ) ALL RIGHT, AS YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED BY NOW, SURVIVAL QUEST IS A SERIES OF CHALLENGES. BELIEVE ME, EACH DAY WILL BE A NEW CHALLENGE. YOU'VE ALL DONE WELL. BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE EXERCISE, STARTS AT THE TOP OF THAT TREE. IT'S CALLED "THE WIND SUCKER." IT MAY LOOK IMPOSSIBLE, BUT IT'S NOT. WHO'D LIKE TO BE FIRST? I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW YOU KIDS HOW IT'S DONE. HAL, YOU'RE AN ANIMAL. AH... COME ON. NO NO NO! NO, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I'M NOT READY. I'M NOT READY. - HAL, HAL, HAL... - NO NO NO NO! JUST LEAN FORWARD, LET THE WIND SUCKER DO THE REST. - Joey: COME ON, HAL! - Olivia: GO FOR IT! Cheryl: COME ON, HAL. - YOU CAN DO IT, HAL! - Cheryl: GO, HAL. FACE IT, THE GUY'S DEAD MEAT. - COME ON, HAL! - I'M SCARED. - IT'S YOU, BUDDY! - I'M REALLY SCARED. HAL, THIS IS NOT AS DANGEROUS AS IT LOOKS. COME ON, COME ON. HOLD ONTO THE ROPE. - HOLD ONTO THE ROPE. - I'M SHAKING ALL OVER. YEAH, DON'T THINK THINK THINK, JUST DO IT. OKAY. OKAY, GIVE ME A SECOND. ONE... TWO, THREE. ARGH! ARGH-HH! ARGH! ( screaming ) ( all cheering ) Man: HE DID IT! I KNEW HE COULD! - ( Hal laughs ) - ( all cheering ) OH, MAN! ( insects chirping ) ( people chattering ) IT'S 87. WHAT SHOULD IT BE? 65. 65. - FEEL THAT. - YEAH, I KNOW IT'S HEAVY, BUT YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT A V.C.R. WAS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. ( all laugh ) BUT I COULD BE WRONG, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. FOUR WEEKS WITH HIM? ( laughing ) YOU TRAVEL LIGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE. THE SCREE WILL CUT THOSE SNEAKERS RIGHT OFF YOUR FEET. I DON'T NEED THIS. TABULA RASA, FRIEND. CLEAN SLATE. Hank: ...SEE IF HE CAN CARRY IT ON HIS BACK. Joey: WAIT A SECOND. YOU MEAN I HAVE TO CARRY IT TOO? ( people chuckling ) NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CARRYING IT. THE BROCHURE NEVER SPECIFIED ACTUALLY CARRYING IT. ( rustling ) SQUEAK, COME HERE. ( grunting ) ALL RIGHT. TONIGHT OUR SUBJECT IS EARS AND HOW TO TAKE THEM OFF. NOW IF YOU GOT IT, HE AIN'T GONNA BELIEVE IT 'CAUSE HE'S IN SHOCK. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? SO YOU SHOW IT TO HIM. ( nervous laughter ) SQUEAK. COUNT ME OUT. HEY, SQUEAK, WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE YOU HURT? LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS GOT TO UNDERSTAND. THIS IS A RUGGED WILDERNESS AREA. WHEN YOU WALK IN THESE WOODS, YOU ARE THE PREDATOR, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SURVIVAL IS ALL ABOUT. BE PREPARED TO ACT, NO REACT! YOU ENCOUNTER A HOSTILE, YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED TO KILL HIM, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GONNA DO TO YOU. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PREDATOR... DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO SURVIVE. A PREDATOR TRUSTS NO ONE. HE RELIES ON NO ONE. OUT HERE, IT'S ONE TO ONE, HAND TO HAND. OKAY, SURVIVAL SITUATION. A COLUMN OF ENEMY MOVING ALONG THE TRAIL. THESE SURVIVAL QUEST FAIRIES WILL BE GOOD PRACTICE FOR YOU GUYS. NOW REMEMBER, SURPRISE AND INTIMIDATION EQUAL EFFECTIVE HARASSMENT. OH, WE'RE GONNA SURPRISE THEM ALL RIGHT. YEAH, BUT REAL PREDATORS HAVE DISCIPLINED CONTROL, RAIDER. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T GOT YET. THESE PEOPLE ARE PUSHOVERS, BUT WE'RE NOT OUT HERE TO HURT ANYBODY, RIGHT? THIS IS ONLY AN EXERCISE. THEY HAVEN'T DROPPED THE BOMB YET. JEEZ. WHOA! WHOA! ( snickering ) ( panting ) YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE SIZE OF THAT PIGEON. I'LL TRADE YOU A LIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF DRAGS OF THAT BABY. MY WIFE MADE ME QUIT LAST YEAR, BUT DAMNED IF I COULDN'T USE A SMOKE RIGHT NOW. LAST ONE? THAT'S TOO BAD. YOU KNOW, THE OTHERS ARE TAKING BETS ON WHETHER YOU'VE GOT A VOICE OR NOT. ( panting ) AND NO MORE. WHEW, GOTTA STOP SMOKING THOSE THINGS. AW, WHAT'S THE MATTER, GRANDPA? COULD KEEP UP WITH THE REST OF THEM? GET THE HELL OFF ME, YOU SON OF A-- AT CLOSE RANGE, I'LL BET THIS WILL TAKE YOUR EYE RIGHT OUT. ARGH! TODAY OUR SUBJECT IS EARS. ( screams ) ( screams ) ( Raider groaning ) Jeff: I TOLD YOU SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT. DIDN'T I? I TOLD YOU. NO ONE WOULD LISTEN. Hal: WE'RE ALL OF US TIRED, BUT I STILL SAY WE HELP HER. WE CAN'T JUST STAY HERE. I THINK WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO IS DIVIDE UP SOME OF CHERYL'S STUFF AMONG OUR PACKS. EVERYBODY'S GOT TO CARRY THEIR OWN WEIGHT. COME ON, JEFF, WE GOT, WHAT, TWO MORE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT? IT'S AT LEAST FOUR, FIVE MILES TO THE CAMPSITE. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I SAY IT'S GETTING LATE. SOMEBODY BETTER MAKE A DECISION. ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE LETTING ANYBODY EASE UP. THAT'S ALL I MEAN. IF SHE CAN'T MAKE IT, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THE COURSE. OH, WELL, GREAT ATTITUDE. LOOK, WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING HERE, ALL RIGHT? SPLIT IT UP. WHAT'D YOU SAY? SHE'S NEVER GONNA MAKE IT BY HERSELF. I SAID WE'RE GONNA SPLIT IT UP. OH, WELL... THE CONVICT HAS SPOKEN. SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE DO. GREAT IDEA. COME ON. Hank: THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. I LOVE COMING TO THIS PLACE. WE'LL CAMP DOWN THERE. LET'S GET SOME DINNER GOING BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN. ( panting ) YOU'D BETTER COVER UP. IT'S GETTING COLD. YOU'LL BE FINE, CHERYL. Jake: WHAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SURVIVAL? IT'S NEVER TO GET CAUGHT. BETTER TO DIE. SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT: WE'RE GONNA PLAY A NICE LITTLE GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK. AND YOU FOUR ARE GOING FIRST. GET YOUR SHIRTS OFF AND GET RID OF YOUR SHOES. RAIDER, TIE THEIR HANDS UP. IF WE CAN'T FIND YOU IN 48 HOURS, YOU PASS. YOU CAN COME BACK IN. BUT IF WE DO FIND YOU, I WANT YOU TO JUST REMEMBER THAT IN THE REAL WORLD THE GRADE FOR FAILURE IS DEATH. SO YOU JUST GOT TO TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH. OKAY... I'M GIVING YOU A 20-MINUTE HEAD START. MACE 'EM. ( screaming ) NOW GO! GO GO GO GO GO! ALL RIGHT, THIS ONE FAILS. TIE HIM DOWN. ALL RIGHT! OKAY, LET'S GO GET 'EM! HEY, COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU ASSHOLES LOOKING AT? WHO DO YOU TRUST? THE FIRST THING YOU OUGHT TO LEARN IS NEVER TO TRUST ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY ME. AND WHEN YOU CATCH 'EM, - YOU'D BETTER MAKE 'EM SORRY! - COME ON, MAN. ( all shouting ) YEAH! GO! ( bird's wings flutter ) HUH-UH. ( grunting ) I DON'T NEED THIS TO KILL YOU. ALL I NEED TO DO IS LET YOU GO. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT ALONE OUT HERE. ( grunts ) Olivia: WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, WE GIRLS OVER HERE ARE GETTING JUST A LITTLE TIRED OF JEFF'S MACHO BULLSHIT. THE FACT IS, YESTERDAY SHE COULDN'T CUT IT ON THE TRAIL. THE REST OF US HAD TO CARRY HER LOAD. NOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT FOR ONE DAY, BUT I CAN'T SEE DOING THAT FOR THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS. THE FACT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A BIG-- JEFF, JEFF, YOU MISS THE POINT. THE CHALLENGE IS NOT FOR EACH OF US TO SUCCEED, BUT FOR ALL OF US TO. I APPRECIATE THE HELP THAT YOU ALL GAVE ME YESTERDAY, BUT I'M ALSO TIRED OF TELLING MYSELF WHAT I CAN'T DO. SO FROM NOW ON I'LL CARRY MY FULL LOAD. - ALL RIGHT, CHERYL. - Hank: GOOD. TODAY WE'RE GONNA START ROTATING THE LEADERSHIP SO THAT EVERYBODY GETS A CRACK AT IT. EVERY DAY A DIFFERENT PERSON LEADS. AND I WANT YOU TO GIVE THEM THE SAME RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION THAT YOU WOULD WANT WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN. TODAY WE'RE HEADING FOR COLTON LAKE. JUST SKIRT THIS LAKE AND FOLLOW THE STREAM. IT'S A SIMPLE HIKE. JEFF, WHY DON'T YOU LEAD? ( Cheryl coughing ) WE'LL REST HERE. ( moaning ) ( exclaims ) NO WAY. COME ON, CHERYL. DON'T STOP, COME ON. JUST KEEP COMING. COME ON, SWEETIE, YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE. ( all cheering ) JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE! Olivia: COME ON! ALL RIGHT! YES, YOU GOT IT! GOOD GIRL. COME ON, CHERYL. COME ON, GET YOUR FOOT ON THE LEDGE THERE. RIGHT FOOT ON THE LEDGE. - COME ON, CHERYL! GOOD GIRL. - YEAH YEAH. - GET YOUR HANDS UP... - RIGHT HERE, CHERYL. - RIGHT HERE. - THAT'S IT, DIG IN. Hal: YOU GOT IT! ( all cheering ) - YEAH! - Joey: YOU MADE IT. - Joey: ALL RIGHT, SO IF THAT'S THAT... - Hank: EXACTLY, EXACTLY. OKAY, SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT... UM, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONCEPT OF, IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. GIVE IT TO ME. ( wind whistling ) Hal: OH, I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN. - Joey: CHECK IT OUT. - Hal: WATER. Cheryl: RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. OH... I WOULD KILL FOR A BATH. - OH GOD. - ( all laughing ) IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT I'M GOING TO BE SLEEPING IN BED WITH A MAN EVERY NIGHT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. LOOK AT ME NOW. WOULD YOU GET MARRIED AGAIN, CHERYL? I THOUGHT I NEEDED SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF ME, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. ( all groaning ) OH GOD! OH NO, GET OUT OF HERE. OH NO-- OH OH, COME ON! ( all screaming ) Cheryl: OH GOD, I'M GONNA BE SICK. Olivia: GIVE THE MAN A HAND. IT'S A SPECIAL TREAT. COME ON, WOLF IT DOWN. - EAT UP. - GET OUT OF HERE. THIS IS ALL THE BREAKFAST YOU'RE GONNA GET, JOEY. WHAT HAPPENED TO GRAPE-NUTS AND DRIED FRUIT AND THINGS? - YUM YUM YUM YUM, COME ON. - OH, COME ON! - EAT. - ARE YOU FOR REAL? - LOOK AT THIS GUY. - OH... ( all laughing, talking ) Joey: GET OUT OF HERE. KEEP DREAMING, PAL. EAT, JOEY. IN THE MOUTH, IN THE MOUTH, IN THE MOUTH... ( all screaming ) Cheryl: OH GOD, I'M GONNA BE SICK. GIVE THE MAN A HAND. Hal: AH, THE WORM TURNS. I'VE HEARD OF FOREST FIRES, BUT I HAD NO IDEA. Jeff: LOOKS LIKE IT WAS NUKED. Hank: THIS FIRE WAS STARTED BY LIGHTNING. PERFECTLY NATURAL. GIVES THE LAND A CHANCE TO REJUVENATE ITSELF, START ANEW. FIRE IS NATURE'S CLEANSER. CAREFUL THERE. WATCH THAT SPOT. GOSH, WHAT IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. ( birds chirping ) EMPTY. WHAT WAS IN IT? GEAR, SUPPLIES, I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A PARACHUTE. HEY, OVER HERE. WELL, THIS SURE BEATS THE ZOO, HUH? ( gunshot ) - ( Olivia screams ) - Joey: JESUS CHRIST. ( men hooting, laughing ) SHIT, NOW THEY GOT REAL GUNS. ( men hooting ) DEAD! MINE! MINE! ( all hooting ) - YEAH! - Jake: THE KILL! YEAH! ( all cheering ) GOOD FOR YOU. ( all cheering ) ( silence ) Jake: HEY, FREAK... WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TIE IT AROUND YOUR NECK? IT'S A TAGGED DEER. IT JUST COST YOU AND YOUR VAMPIRES 750 BUCKS. WHAT ARE YOU, SOME KIND OF DEN MOTHER? WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET BACK TO YOUR SCOUTS? HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA SQUAT HERE? AS LONG AS IT TAKES. - OH YEAH? - YEAH. WHAT'S IT TO YOU? WELL, YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING PRETTY DESPERATE. WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SAVE YOUR ASS, THAT'S ALL. ( chuckles ) SAVE OUR ASSES FROM WHAT? ALL THIS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MOTHER NATURE: - YOU WANT SOME FUCKING REALITY? - YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT NOW IT'S YOU AND ME. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS YOU AND ME. 'CAUSE IF YOU USE ANY OF THAT LIVE AMMO ON ANY OF MY PEOPLE, IT IS YOU AND ME. I'M GONNA COME LOOKING FOR YOU. YEAH, YOU'LL COME LOOKING. GO AHEAD, TAKE HOLD OF MY KNIFE. I'LL SLIT YOUR THROAT BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE HANDLE. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE, DO YOU... ( ear thuds ) ...WITH ALL THIS ARMAMENT? SURVIVAL IN THE WILDERNESS IS A MATTER OF HEART, NOT HARDWARE. YOU'RE NOT THAT FAR GONE, ARE YOU? THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON OUT HERE THAN MEETS THE EYE. BINGO. I DON'T NEED THAT. JAKE, JAKE! YOU REALLY SHOWED HIM, JAKE! WHAT ARE YOU, MY CHEERLEADER? PICK UP THE DEER AND LET'S MOVE OUT! THIS DON'T LOOK GOOD. LOOKS LIKE IT WAS CUT. Man: FUCK YOU, SURVIVAL QUEST! ( men laugh and hoot ) ALL RIGHT, TEAM DECISION, A BIG ONE. THAT IS THE ONLY TRAIL TO THE BACKSIDE, AND OUR SURVIVAL QUEST COURSE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU FACE THE CHALLENGES TO BE FOUND THERE. BUT WITH THAT FOOTBRIDGE CUT, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THERE-- WE HAVE TO CLIMB THAT PEAK. DON'T WE EVER DO ANYTHING ON THE GROUND IN THIS COURSE? I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT IS NOT GONNA BE A CAKEWALK. I USUALLY SAVE THE MOUNTAINEERING TILL LAST. BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY, I BELIEVE YOU CAN MAKE IT. I SAY WE DO IT. ME TOO. IF I FALL OFF THAT MOUNTAIN, I'M TAKING TWO OF YOU WITH ME. YOU'VE DRAWN THE TOUGHEST LEAD OF THE COURSE. ( all struggling ) OFF BELAY. ( echoing ) I'M GONNA TAKE THE LEAD NOW. NO, JEFF, WE'RE WAITING HERE. WHAT? WAIT? FOR WHAT? WE'VE ONLY GOT AN HOUR OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. LOOK, JOEY'S HAVING A TOUGH TIME DOWN THERE. HANK'S WITH HIM, BUT THEY'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY MAKE IT THIS FAR BY NIGHTFALL. HE'S THE INSTRUCTOR. HE CAN TAKE CARE OF JOEY. YOU KNOW HOW COLD IT GETS UP HERE AT NIGHT? WELL, YOU'D JUST BETTER GET USED TO IT, BECAUSE WE MIGHT JUST END UP SPENDING THE NIGHT RIGHT HERE. SHIT! HOLD IT. COME ON, JOEY. Cheryl: I HAVE YOUR LEG. HOLD HIS LEGS. GET HIS LEGS. GOOD. I HAVE YOUR LEG. OKAY, WE GOT HIM. IS EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT? WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO STOP HERE? HERS. I TOLD HER WE SHOULD HEAD ON. SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN. IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION, CHERYL, BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE. JOEY AND I COULD HAVE NEVER MADE IT WITHOUT YOU, - WHATEVER YOU GUYS KEPT TELLING HER. - Jeff: I'M SORRY. Hank: COME ON, JOEY. JOEY, COME ON. - Jeff: I'M SORRY. - GRAY! WAKE HIM UP, WAKE HIM UP. - GRAY, WAKE UP. - WE'VE GOT TO DIG US AN ICE CAVE, RIGHT NOW. - NOW. - GRAY? - ( Gray groaning ) - GRAY, WAKE UP... - WAKE UP, WE'RE MOVING. - Hank: COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO DIG AN ICE CAVE. Jeff: DAMN IT, IT'S COLD IN HERE. IT'S LIKE SLEEPING IN A REFRIGERATOR. Hank: IT'S A HELL OF A LOT COLDER OUTSIDE. - Olivia: WHAT TIME IS IT? - Hal: IT'S, UH... OH, 3:00 GODDAMN A.M. OH, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, PAL. IT'S BEEN 3:00 A.M. FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I HAVE A FEELING THIS WATCH IS FROZEN SOLID. Olivia: I CAN'T FEEL MY FEET ANYMORE. ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE UP. CHERYL, GET IN WITH OLIVIA. - HAL... - ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO WITH GRAY. Hank: JEFF AND JOEY. WE JUST GOT TO HANG ON A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. ( all groaning ) THE SUN WILL BE UP IN ABOUT AN HOUR. Joey: YOU'VE GOT A NICE WARM ASS, MAN, BUT THIS IS JUST A ONE-NIGHT STAND. REMEMBER THAT, OKAY? ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE HOUR. JUST GOTTA MAKE IT ONE MORE HOUR. ( all cheering ) WHOO! Hank: THAT MOUNTAIN TESTED YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR STAMINA. NOW WE'RE GONNA TEST YOUR SPIRIT. - Hal: OH NO! - ( laughs ) - THINK WE'RE READY FOR IT? - Hank: YOU'RE READY. EACH ONE OF YOU IS GOING SOLO... FOR THREE DAYS, ALONE, ALL ALONE... WITH A MINIMUM OF EQUIPMENT. NO TENTS, SLEEPING BAGS? HUH-UH. SPACE BLANKET. JOEY. JEFF. THESE ARE FIRST-AID KITS. - THERE YOU GO. - THANKS. LISTEN, I'M GONNA INCLUDE SOME NOTEBOOKS TOO, SO YOU CAN KEEP A JOURNAL-- YOUR PRIVATE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS. NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA READ IT. GRAY. WHERE'S THE FOOD? FOOD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT. SWELL. THAT'S GOOD. NO, REALLY. NO, I LIKE THAT, THAT IT SHOULD BE WHERE I FIND IT. THAT'S GOOD. THANKS. YOUR NEAREST NEIGHBOR'S GONNA BE ABOUT TWO MILES DOWNSTREAM, HAL. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SOLO. Jeff: GO GET 'EM, HAL. ALL RIGHT! BARBEQUE TONIGHT. Gray's voice: NOBODY'S GONNA READ THIS. I'LL TELL HIM I LOST IT. "SOLO." MY WHOLE LIFE'S BEEN SOLO. BUT I LIKE IT OUT HERE. IT'S DIFFERENT. LOOK AT THAT VIEW. ( exhales ) AIN'T THIS SUPPOSED TO BE SOLO? LOOK, GRAY, I KNOW WE HAD PROBLEMS. YOU RESENT ME. YOU THINK I'M SOME GUY FROM THE SYSTEM, COME TO PUSH YOU AROUND. YOU'RE WRONG. YOU'RE DEAD WRONG. I'M A LOT LIKE YOU, BUDDY. I HAD NO FAMILY, NO BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I HAD NOBODY. I'VE BEEN PUSHED FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME, AND THEN FINALLY WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, I GOT A FOSTER PARENT. AND I CALLED HIM "DAD" BECAUSE HE SHOWED ME ALL OF THIS. YEAH, I HAD A FEW DADS THAT JUST WANTED TO SHOW ME A BELT. SO, YEAH, I HAD A COUPLE OF THOSE MEATHEADS TOO. BUT THIS GUY, HE PUT ME IN THE BOY SCOUTS. BEFORE THAT, I NEVER HAD A SHIRT OR A PAIR OF PANTS THAT DIDN'T HAVE A TEAR IN IT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HERE I AM WITH MY OWN FUCKING BOY SCOUT UNIFORM. ( both laugh ) YEAH. HE DIED WHEN I WAS 16, AND I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO THANK HIM. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? I'M NOT AN AUTHORITY FIGURE. I MEAN... I MAY RISK MY ASS TO HELP YOU OUT ONCE IN A WHILE. I NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT TO DO. IT'S NOT LIKE IN THE CITY. THERE'S NO LOW MAN ON THE TOTEM POLE OUT HERE. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, GRAY? SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES MAD, BAD, AND SAD? GOOD LUCK ON YOUR SOLO. HEY. HI. I HEAR THESE THINGS TASTE KINDA LIKE CHICKEN. THINK YOU CAN COOK IT? OKAY, LET'S GIVE IT A TRY. HA! COME ON, RAIDER, COME ON! THAT'S A FATAL MISTAKE, RAIDER. DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT? I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE ULTIMATE IN HAND-TO-HAND. IF AN ENEMY EVER TURNS HIS BACK ON YOU, IT'S PURE INSTINCT. YOU JUST STICK YOUR KNIFE RIGHT HERE BEHIND HIS EAR, RIP RIGHT ACROSS THE JUGULAR AND DOWN THROUGH THE HEART. HE'S DEAD IN A SECOND. THEY CALL IT "THE DEAD MAN'S WISH," 'CAUSE IT'S QUICK. YOU LOSE, RAIDER. STRIKE ONE. WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT, RAIDER? DON'T YOU EVER TURN YOUR BACK ON AN ENEMY AGAIN, YOU HEAR? WANT THE REST OF THAT? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. IT'S LOOKING PRETTY BAKED, ISN'T IT? IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH. OH, THANKS. MY MOTHER SPENT A FORTUNE SENDING ME TO THESE GOURMET COOKING CLASSES, RIGHT? SHE WAS CONVINCED IT WOULD HELP ME CATCH MY FUTURE HUSBAND. MY FIANCE HATES MY COOKING ANYWAY. THEN AGAIN, I NEVER DID COOK RATTLESNAKE FOR HIM. ( chuckles ) IT'S GOOD. IT'S BETTER THAN BUGS. ( laughs ) OH THANKS. HEY, I'D BETTER GET GOING. SUPPOSED TO BE SOLO, YOU KNOW? THANKS FOR COMING BY. YEAH, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. ( mimics gunshot ) Joey: YEAH, NO MORE WORMS FOR ME. 2:00 AT THE RENDEZVOUS POINT. I'LL MEET YOU THERE, ALL RIGHT? - Gray: ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU IN A COUPLE. - SEE YOU LATER. ( sniffles ) HANDS UP, CONVICT. - FUCK YOU. - "FUCK YOU"? I GOT LIVE AMMO NOW. I'LL BLOW YOUR GODDAMN HEAD OFF. NOW MOVE IT. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT MAKING A MOVE, 'CAUSE I'M JUST LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE. WHY DON'T YOU GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND BEG FOR MERCY? GET DOWN! LET'S SEE, FIRST I'M GONNA TAKE THIS EAR OFF. I COULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW IF I WANTED TO. BANG! HA. NOBODY'D GIVE A SHIT ANYWAY. I WAS WATCHING YOU. I SAW YOU BACK THERE WITH THOSE HANDCUFFS ON. YOU'RE TRASH. ( grunts ) BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE DEAD TRASH. THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY COOL THE OTHER DAY WITH THAT KNIFE, HUH? I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR FUCKING FACE OFF. SHIT, THEY'D PROBABLY GIVE ME A MEDAL FOR SHOOTING A STRAY. ( snaps ) ( shot echoing ) ( all shouting ) GOD DAMN IT! ( groaning ) YOU MURDERING LITTLE SHIT. THIS IS AS BAD... AS IT FUCKING GETS. BUT IT'S YOUR ASS, NOT MINE. ( blade clicks ) ( groaning ) NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON AN ENEMY, JAKE. ( gunshots continue ) OH GOD, I THINK HE'S DEAD. CHRIST, WHAT HAPPENED? THAT BASTARD KILLED JAKE. SO I SHOT HIM. WHY-- WHY-- WHY WOULD HE GO AFTER--? WE ALL SAW HIM PULL A KNIFE ON JAKE THE OTHER DAY. - THAT'S RIGHT. - LOOK! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? THAT CONVICT SON OF A BITCH HELPED KILL JAKE. WE-- WE CAN'T JUST GO SHOOTING PEOPLE. WE GOTTA THINK THIS THING OUT, GO FOR HELP. NO! THIS IS NOT A GAME ANYMORE, CHECKER. JUST LIKE JAKE SAID, WE GOTTA ACT, NOT REACT. I SAY WE HUNT THAT CONVICT DOWN. All: YEAH. COME ON. WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? FUCK IF I KNOW. COME ON. - Hal: WHERE'S GRAY? - Joey: WE GOT TO GO BACK AND GET HANK. - WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM THERE. - WE CAN'T! THEY'VE GOT GUNS. GRAY! UH... GRAY, GRAY, WHAT? WHAT? HANK'S DEAD.
