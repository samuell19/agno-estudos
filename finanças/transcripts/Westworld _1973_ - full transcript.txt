Hi. Ed Renfrew for Delos again. If there's anyone who doesn't know... ...what Delos is, well, as we've always said: Delos is the vacation of the future, today. At Delos, you get your choice of the vacation you want. There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld. Let's talk to some people who've been there. - Pardon me. What is your name? - Gardner Lewis. - Just got back from Westworld. - Tell us how you liked it. When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid, you'd point, go "bang"... ...and the other kid would pretend dead. Well, Westworld is the same thing, only it's for real. I shot six people. Well, uh, they weren't real people. What Mr. Lewis means is he shot six robots... ...scientifically programmed to look, act, talk and even bleed just like humans do. - Isn't that right? - Well, they may have been robots. I mean, uh, I think they were robots. I mean, I know they were robots. Yes, the robots of Westworld are there to serve you... ...and to give you the most unique vacation experience of your life. Thank you, sir. And you, madam? - Hello. - What is your name? My name is Janet Lane, and I was in Roman World. What is the one thing that stands out in your mind about Roman World? Oh, well, I think it would be... ...the men. I just feel marvelous. I mean, it's just a warm, glowing place to be. - Thank you very much. - Oh, thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - And you, sir? - Yeah? What is your name, sir? Oh, I'm Ted Mann. I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis. And which world did you just come from, sir? Oh, you're not gonna believe this. I've just been the sheriff of Westworld for the last two weeks. - Did it seem real to you? - It's the realest thing I ever done. - I mean that. - Thank you very much. Yeah. - And you, sir? - My name's Arthur Caine. I've been in the castle. I've had a couple of sword fights and three jousts. And I... I married a beautiful princess. Is that something you always dreamed of doing, sir? All my life. Ha-ha-ha. There were some comments of the people who just returned from Delos. Why don't you make arrangements to take our hovercraft to Medieval World... ...Roman World and Westworld? Was it worth $1000 a day? Yes. Contact us today, or see your travel agent. Boy, have we got a vacation for you. 505-345-675, Delta 9. 505-345-675, Delta 9. Read you as Kappa 505-899 on a y-axis... ...confirm a reading of Gamma 505-786. See if you have all that. Kappa 505-899... This is Delos Control to Station 3. You're cleared on vector 79, on a 195. We anticipate a scan in about four and a half minutes. I'm not worried at all. I'm just c... Thanks. I'm just curious. How much do they weigh? - Three or 4 pounds. - That heavy? Do they have much of a kick? A Colt .45? Well, I never fired one before. Hey. What about that thing where you go like this over the gun? - Fanning. - Yeah. What about it? - Is that hard to do? - No. Now, when they give you the gun belt... ...does it have those strings to tie around your leg? - If that's the kind you want. - That's the kind I want. I think it's probably better for quick draws, you know? It all depends. What kind of gun belt did you have the last time? I had the one without the strings. - And you could draw fast? - Mm-hm. Hmm. Then maybe it doesn't matter after all. - The guns they give you are real guns? - Mm-hm. - Real guns. - Ha. That's incredible. Give us a shift to 197 and take it down to 443. We have negative acceleration of 22... ...so long as you maintain passenger comfort. Sequencing was transferred according to the log at 041. The orientation on the resort will now begin. Please put on your earphones. Don't you wanna listen? I heard it the last time. Consists of three separate resort areas, each with its own special appeal. Whichever resort you've chosen... ...we are sure you will have a fascinating and rewarding stay here. Western World is a complete re-creation of the American frontier of 1880. Here it is possible to relive the excitement... ...and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest. Western World is a life of lawless violence... ...a society of guns and action. This is Medieval World, where we have reconstructed 13th-century Europe. A world of chivalry and combat, romance and excitement. Our teams of engineers have spared no expense in this re-creation... ...precise to the smallest detail. Then we have Roman World: A lusty treat for the senses in the setting of delightful, decadent Pompeii. Here the traveler experiences the sensual, relaxed morality... ...that existed at the peak of the imperial Roman Empire. All together, these resorts comprise Delos... ...the most exciting vacation spot in the history of man. This is Delos Control to Station 3. Your negative deceleration should be 25... ...and ground speed should be 355 and dropping. The whole spectrum of technology has been employed in Delos... ...for the vacationer's pleasure. Expensive and unusual... ...Delos is not for everyone. But for those that choose it... ...it is truly a unique and rewarding experience. Think about transferring for the approach. - Transfer 393. - Note a wind change... We have you on Grid 5, over. Notify ground crews. Stand by. Locking in now. Shut down two, shut down three. Down two. Down three. Nice job, everybody. Welcome to Delos. Please go to your color-coded tram... ...which will take you to the world of your choice. Give your name to the attendant. Welcome to Delos. Please go to your color-coded tram... ...which will take you to the world of your choice. - May I have your name, please? - John Blane. - Peter Martin. - Thank you. Please go to your color-coded tram... ...which will take you to the world of your choice. We are sure you will enjoy your stay... - Was she a...? - Probably. That's amazing. There are no rules... Supposedly, you really can't tell, except by looking at the hands. Do not be afraid of hurting anything... They haven't perfected the hands yet. Nothing can go wrong. You will enjoy your stay in Roman World. While you are there, please feel free to indulge your every whim. Medieval World exists for you, the guest. Nothing can go wrong. See if you can get another programmer on the grid. I have a quick fade in the CRT and my balance controls don't seem to help me. I'm keeping this in real time. Switch me over to an online status and I'll do it manually. You've got a 3-millisecond cycle delay which should be computed in. I don't know what to do if the stagecoach is late. Oh, it's fantastic. I reckon that's everything. Bath's down the hall. Bath will cost you two bits for hot water. Dinner at 7, breakfast at 6:30. Get lunch on your own. Couple places in town to eat. Don't look like much here, but we have everything. Just a minute. - You mean to tell me he's a robot? - That's what I mean to tell you. I'm paying $1000 a day for this? Well, it's authentic. The West of the 1880s. Well, at least they could have made it a little more comfortable. That's the point. This is really the way it was. If you wanted comfort, you should have stayed in Chicago. Hey, Julie would have loved all this. Poking around for hours in all those funny shops, looking for silly... Peter, what the hell's wrong with you? You're a lawyer. You know better than anybody else what a ride she took you for. - Well, the kids. - Well, fine, the kids. Here you are, six months later, still thinking about it. No, not really. Just came to mind, is all. There's a lot to do here. - What'll it be? - Whiskey. What about you? Uh, vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please. Just give him whiskey. He's new in town. - You gotta get into the feel of the thing. - I feel silly. Why? It looks like a joke. Well, it's not a joke, it's an amusement park. The best amusement park in the world. All you have to do is have fun. Some pretty rough-looking customers here. - How many of them are...? - Guests like us? Who knows? That's the beauty of this place, it doesn't matter. It may look rough, but it's still just a resort. There's no way to get hurt here. Just enjoy yourself. What is this stuff? It doesn't say. - God. Give me this. - Puts hair on your chest. Yeah. Sloppy with your drink. - Get this boy a bib. - Ha. Yes, sir. - Go on. - No. He needs his mama. Kill him. If you don't kill him... You talk too much. You say something, boy? I said, you talk too much. Why don't you make me shut up? Your move. Pretty realistic, huh? Listen, are you sure he was a...? Of course. You don't really think you shot anybody, do you? Wow. Hey, John... ...how do I know I'm not gonna kill another guest with this thing? Try it. Shoot me. Go on, shoot. Shoot! The gun has a sensing device. It won't fire at anything with a high body temperature. Only something cold, like a machine. Hmm. They thought of everything. The Black Knight won't be repaired till tomorrow afternoon. The dungeon lighting is 55. Repeat, 55. Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled for 5:30, if that conforms. Well, what do folks do for companionly entertainment in this town? I wouldn't know about such things. I'm just running this hotel. Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon down at the end of the street. Now, I won't have talk of that woman in this house. Not over my dinner. The food's real good, ma'am. Thank you, stranger. You're a gentleman of some breeding. Isn't she terrific? Who's Miss Carrie? Uh... You fellas new in town? Yep. Whiskey. Just passing through? Maybe. Looking for some fun? Maybe. Well, you come to the right place. There's plenty of fun here. That's Cindy and Arlette. Arlette's from Paris. Perhaps you gentlemen are taking a liking to them. Perhaps. - They're real accommodating. - John. They, uh... - They look it. - John, listen... Why don't you just go on upstairs and we'll reckon accounts later? - John, are those...? - Sounds good to me. Are those two girls machines? Now, how can you say a thing like that? Come on. What's going on? - They're robbing the bank. - Robbing the bank? - Hey, maybe we ought to go help out. - Uh-uh. You don't know, it might be fun to fight bank robbers. Look, Pete, this is better. There, uh... There is something I have to tell you. I don't know if it matters... ...but it matters to me. I haven't ever had a, uh... A... Well, I hardly know you, if you know what I mean. I mean, we just met a few minutes ago. And, uh... You're probably very nice. I feel funny. Why? I think you're very nice. How was it? Wasn't it terrific? Boy, machines are the servant of man. Wasn't that great? Not bad. "Not bad." Now you're the big lover. Well, you know how it is. Some guys have a way with women. Shooting stopped. I guess we missed the robbery. You can't have everything. Mm-mm. - John... - Hmm? ...this place is really fun. I think it's the gyro unit. - What do you think? - I wonder if we shouldn't rewire her. I'd replace the whole unit rather than try to repair it. With a 10? Use an XX-50 if we have any. The double X's have a longer lifespan. A 50 may not fit in here. Well, maybe you can shift the integrator unit further up into the cavity. I'll try. - Mm. Balance servo again? - Yeah, she fell over this afternoon. I think it's the sensor. But if it's the central unit, we'll have to open her up. Well, you get a confirmation before you do that. - What's he in for? - Central malfunction. Another one? Hmm. From the day we opened... ...we had a failure-and-breakdown rate conforming to computer predictions. That is, 0.3 malfunctions for each 24-hour activation period... ...concurrent or not. Now, this was an anticipated operations aspect of the resort... ...and we were fully able to handle it. The majority of the breakdowns were minor or peripheral... ...until about six weeks ago. Then Roman World had a rise in breakdown rate... ...which doubled in a week. In addition, we saw a disproportionate rise in central... ...as opposed to peripheral, breakdowns. Now, we identified some problems with humidity control... ...and regained homeostasis. Well, despite our corrections, the breakdown rate continued to climb. Then Medieval World began to have trouble. Now we're seeing more Western World breakdowns. There's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy... ...to an infectious-disease process, spreading from one area to the next. Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease. It's only a theoretical concept. There are many ways to order that data. I must confess, I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery. But we aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment... ...almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been designed by other computers. We don't know exactly how they work. That input goes out at level 55 for pulse forms of 039 duration. We'll try to stabilize there. Okay, my telemetry is good. Repeat, I have good telemetry. We have sunrise at 0.43. Ready on all quadrants. Energize grid. Grid energized. Confirmed. All right, then give me 436, if you can patch that in. If not, 435. I have sound now. Thank you very much. Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon and cinnamon toast. Do you have cinnamon toast? You do? Okay, send it down to Central Control Room, Console 3. Wait a minute. Now, what was that? No grounding, Unit 5? Try a bypass. I have readings on all units, 5 included. Hold on a minute. All right, let's stand by for resort activation. You ready on phase 443? Four-four-three. Okay, we're gonna activate at 59. Lower gain Alpha 2. Ready on six, on five, on four... ...on three, on two, activate now. What do you want? Not one word. You mind if I finish shaving? Have you no sense of de...? Was he bothering you? He isn't gonna bother you again. Well, I'm here to tell you that things have changed. There's law here now. You can't go around plugging whoever you please. But, sheriff, it was self-defense. That's what they all say. He shot a man. He'll have to stand trial. Judge will be here next week. If I were you, I wouldn't trouble over your friend here. Judge Benson likes to hang them. Hang them high. - Look, sheriff... - Beat it. I said, beat it. I've never been in jail before. First time for everything. But I haven't done anything wrong. Well, you shot a man. That's something. - Where you from? - Chicago. Well, Chicago's a long way from here, fella. A thousand miles and more. Hold it. I guess that sort of makes us desperados. Yeah, I guess. Well, what do we do now? Well, the way I figure it, anything we want. - There's no law in that town now. - I'll say. - We go in there... - We do anything we want. You know what? - What? - I almost believe all this. Well, why shouldn't you believe it? It's as real as anything else. Yep. I reckon. - What can you give me in Grid 7? - We have that on SM-514. Transfer, now. Transferred. Reschedule. She wants to meet the king. We have to restructure for that. Can't disappoint a guest. Listen, this is the third day in a row... ...that I've called you about my laundry. You've got all my shirts... We're rechecking the tapes on the mechanism now. We have programmed infidelity in the queen as of, uh, two minutes ago. All right, coming up on the castle. Zero, now. It also conforms with your five-year history at this time of year. Leave me now. My queen. If the king should hear of this, we would both be put to death. I would be more than happy to die for you, my lady. Let us pray it shall not be so. I have news. The Black Knight has returned and seeks a match with you. - The Black Knight? - None other. Is he pretty tough? He has the strength of 10, and cunning besides. But his sight is weak in his left eye. Stay to his left and you will prevail and win the day. Confirmation of the reprogramming of that Black Knight... ...for left lateral weakness and instability for tomorrow. I shall see you on the morrow? My lady. The schedule of tomorrow a.m. It's his last day in the resort. Let's make it a lulu. Tomorrow a.m., broadswords. Schedule locked. We have a problem with the air conditioning in Beta section. Send a crew out. Yes. He can be sheriff any time he wants. That is correct. Just give him the badge. Now, I'm the new law around here. You think you can handle things? You wanna try me? A thousand pardons, milord. What is your name, child? Daphne. Daphne. Oh, I love this place. I love my horse. - I love my horse and I love Julie. - Oh, shut up, will you? I like the spots on my horse. - Did you see the spots on the horse? - Your horse is beautiful. - Thank you very much. I liked yours too. - Thank you. Look out. Let me handle this. Get it, get it, John. Goddamn it. - Do you suppose it's real? - Hell, no. That's not supposed to happen. Maybe it is. Maybe it's part of the thing. The hell. Goddamn machines, anyway. That's not supposed to happen. - A rattlesnake struck a guest? - He was shooting at it and missed. Even so, the snakes are programmed never to strike. - Was the guest injured? - Minor puncture wounds. Inexcusable to injure a guest. Pick up that snake for a total post at once. Check all the snake's central mechanisms tonight during the repair period. Doesn't anything work around here? Logic circuits on the snake simply failed to respond. There was no sign of mechanical damage or tampering... ...and no clue to the malfunction. Central mechanism psychosis? I feel we should shut down the resort for a month. Oh, that seems rash. Well, a snake injured a guest. We can't allow that to happen. Many elements of the Delos Resort are potentially dangerous. That's part of the appeal, but if they become truly... I agree. We can announce that the resort is overbooked... ...and not allow any further new guests to arrive. We can take care of the ones already here. If we can't insure the safety of the guests, we're in desperate trouble. But we can insure their safety. Everything's fine. All right, let's start that bar fight. Cheat. - John, what do you say? - Uh... Hit me. Now, that's just rude. Okay. Hey, look out. Look out. Whoa. Hey, sheriff! Come on! Come on, let's go upstairs. Look out. Yeah. Woo-hoo! Yeah. - What's his problem? - Nothing. He got shot up today, so we're taking the opportunity... - ...to replace the visual cortex. - Mm-hm. Using the new infrared units. And we're increasing audio sensitivity. - You called for me, my lord? - Yes. How long have you been in the palace, Daphne? - Since I was 3, my lord. - Aww... Charming. I think we ought to get to know each other better, Daphne. Better, milord? I can reward you well. Milord. Daphne. Milord. Daphne. Milord forgets himself. Uh-oh. Problem with the girl. Program breakdown. What's the trouble? One of the castle machines isn't responding. Refusing a guest's seduction. Get her out of there, report it to Central Repair. Right. Refusing? - Did you find the trouble? - No apparent trouble. But she wasn't following programming. She refused a guest's seduction, and she is a sex model. - Certainly is. - You think they're gonna shut down? No, the directors feel to close down now would hurt tourist confidence. I don't like it. Breakfast. I'm never gonna drink again. Aah... Okay, I've gained 437. I'm not getting sound pickup in the 10th quadrant. Please check my Lisda console. Hold, varlet. - Are you speaking to me? - None other, sire. Uh, lookit, I'm hungry and I... Prepare for thy doom, thy scurrilous knave, huh? Wait a minute. Uh... Can't we talk this over? What, have you no spine, varlet? - Well, I... - Aha. The queen. Full monitor. Okay. Let him go. Oh, what a hangover. Aye, varlet. We're losing a little tolerance. Bring me up. Shut down. Shut down immediately. Circuits don't respond, sir. - Then cut the robot power. - Power cut. Oh, my head. I'm freezing. Gotta get to the hotel. I think I'm gonna be sick. - They're not responding. - Should we cut the main power grid, sir? Shut it all down. Shut it all down. Hold it. Come on, not now. Not you again. It's too early. Let me do it this time. Your move. - I'm shot. - What? I'm shot. John? Oh, my God. Draw. Sir, we have no control over the robots at all. - They're running on stored charge. - How long can they go? Some will begin to run down in an hour. Others can go a full 12. - Turn the main grid back on. - The relays must be frozen. We can't get back our power. Hello? Hello? Hello? Listen, how we gonna get out of here? All these doors are electrically powered. Now, get these doors open in here before we all suffocate. Temperature elevated, 98 degrees. Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping. Get that power on so we can open these doors. Hey. - Hey. - Don't shoot me. Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter with you? Hold out your hands. Let me see your hands. You're a guest. You really gave me a scare. Look, uh, everything's broken down. The machines have gone crazy. You know about the machines? Yeah, I repair them. There's one chasing me now. A gunslinger. Gunslinger. Must be a model 404, maybe a 406. If he's a 406, he's got all the sensory equipment. - It's a beautiful machine. - He's after me! - I don't doubt it. - What can I do? There's nothing you can do. He'll get you. You haven't got a chance. - There must be something. - Fella, don't kid yourself. There are things you could try, acid for his visual system... ...noise for his hearing. No matter what you did... ...he'll always be one jump ahead of you. You haven't got a chance. Yes, I do. Ha. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. All right. It's all right. - It's okay. - Help me. All right, all right. - Help me. - You're gonna be all right. Help me. Help me... No water. - Go ahead. Go ahead and drink. - No water. - I'm trying to help you. - No water. No. No. N... Why don't you make arrangements to take our hovercraft... ...to Medieval World, Roman World and Westworld? Contact us today, or see your travel agent. Boy, have we got a vacation for you. Vacation for you. For you, for you, you, you, you...
