Farid Morocco - See you! - Bye! Bye. TAXING LOVE - Do you want one? - No thanks. - Yes, you do. - No I don't. Suit yourself. TAX INSPECTION OFFICE I'm Malwina's friend. She recommended you. We had an appointment for today. Please, come in. Let's move on. Miss Matysiak, I'm just a local baker. - I bake bread for... - ...people. I know. People who could use your taxes. You owe a school's annual budget in taxes. I've represented Mr Zygmunt for years... This invoice says "mode of transport." A quad bike. 61-cubic-inch engine, 80 horsepower for... 50,000 zloty. - Not to mention the inscription... - ..."Store decor". I've been to the engraver. "To Tymon on his tenth birthday". Shall we move on? - See you next week. - Until then. - Hi! - Hi. Shouldn't you be with a local baker now? He called me a Nazi. Then apologized and gave up. - He begged to be spared the interest. - This is your third baker. Our. Soon you'll become the youngest manager in the office. What, without any sexual harassment? I'll think about that. I'm seeing someone. I'm not. Hello! I'll be the youngest manager in the office. - What? - I'm going to get promoted. - Great. - We must celebrate. - Will nine be okay? - Sure. Hang on, I have an appointment. - About the job? - Yeah. Great! More to celebrate. I still have some work to do. How about eleven? Let's meet at 'On the Road'. - Where? - On the Road. - Like Kerouac's novel. - Who? Rose Street. Got it? Bye! ON THE ROAD Have you seen a... ...guy with a moustache? Hello! - Where are you? - Here! Where? At Rose's. This place rocks! Wojtuś and Kacper are here, too. Cheers! And where are you? Eh? Campari, please. Actually, make that two. I'd like to order a cab to 7 Rose Street. Ten minutes. Thanks. She had one hell of a voice. ♪ And everything's okay ♪ ♪ Oh Yes! ♪ ♪ Isn't this a lovely day ♪ What are you celebrating? Yet another success. And you? I'm waiting for my sentence. A criminal. A dangerous thug. To the judge's good mood. Marian. I'm seeing someone. So I heard. You won't pick me up in ten minutes. I'll give it a try. Klara. Will you excuse me. Mum, is everything all right? Perhaps he should see a doctor. I know... I'll come to see you, but now is not a good time. I don't want to be a mother. Not even a godmother. Why did you say that? I don't want to. Jesus! 500 for a priest. What are you on about? Mum? Now what? Nothing, I apologize. Moron. - Oaf. - Careful! Casanova from Warsawville. Country bumpkin. - So what? - Nothing. - What's wrong with country bumpkins? - Nothing. Good night. Do you get drunk every night and harass women? You've failed again. Briefcase, car keys, iPhone. A country bumpkin, no more, no less. A cute little car, small and trendy, a bit like a kid's toy. Country bumpkin rents a studio and fills it with treasures from Ikea. And flirts with her boss to get a promotion. Mind reader, my ass. And what's this? Amber. Local colour. Kashubia region? No, next. Kołobrzeg. It is Kołobrzeg. A Catholic upbringing on top of that. But things will change. Your own wine cellar. Skiing in summer, surfing in winter. Or the other way round. And no kids! Kids in good time. What a cliché. Sugar? Wait, sugar sucks. Sugar... makes your ass fat. The nicer the ass you have, the faster you get promoted. Time for you to go. - You better pray... - Catholic to the bone. You're out of line. - Pray that our paths never cross again. - You're not my type. We're out of coffee. Get some. How's school going? It's alright. How's your mum? How is she doing? Awesome. She got five likes on Facebook and lost it completely. Great. Is this because of a girl? What? Did you fight... over a girl? I don't do that. Want a piece of advice? - No. - You better start doing it. Bloody peasant! If I see you again, I'll rip your head off! You sexist pig! Bloody wino! Someone will be right with you. A visitor. - It can't be that bad, right? - Yeah. Mr Wydrzycki? - That's me. - Follow me, please. I told you so. It's not that bad. This way, please. Mr Wydrzycki? Please, take a seat. We've been waiting for you. I'm happy to see you. Charming as ever. You two know each other? No, we don't. Do you know me? Obviously not. - But you remind me of someone. - Someone? Or something? A bumpkin maybe? Tax inspector Klara Matysiak. Please fill in this form. Opening and closing balance for the year. I must inform you that falsifying evidence could result in a three-year prison sentence. In the case of taxes being outstanding and unpaid your assets may be seized. You'll lodge an appeal and you will lose. And if we add perjury to this... Society must isolate corrupt individuals. You have two days to regulate your affairs. - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi. We've run out. How was your meeting? It was great. So you're taking this job? I haven't decided yet. Why? They want to make you a manager despite your lack of experience. - Exactly. - What? They are only doing it because my dad's on the supervisory board. Are you surprised?! Maybe I don't want to work in a big firm. If not there, then where? You've done nothing to... Are you on your period? Hi, Mum. Please, give me a break. I do not go to church. No, I won't go to confession. Why do you keep on about this lawyer? I'm already seeing someone. How's Dad? Okay. I'll do my best. Bye. You buy a flat. The notary sends the deeds to the IRS. They take a look. Your tax returns are sh... They suck. It's unclear how you earn a living. You buy a flat in a good area, 70 square metres for 700,000. In cash. To put it simply, show where the dough came from or... ...they'll charge you with a 75-percent tax. 525... - ...grand? - No more, no less. What's your advice? Depends who's on your case. Any friends in high places? What do you mean? Do you know anyone who works there? You know, only prostitutes work tax-free. - You? - Yes. You are a prostitute. It's never happened before... it has, more than once. The court revoked your decision. Check the Supreme Court's database. Here's the list of my rendezvous for the last three years. It's all in here. May I? No. What do the numbers stand for? Surnames. Your clients won't speak publically. How will you prove you're a prostitute? One of them has agreed to talk. I had a crush on her. She was in that movie, it was called... Good... ...Heavens! What a classic! - That scene by the river... - Are you serious? Her with him?! Well, no... 500 zloty per session. Session? That's what we call it. Where would you meet? At my place. Or at his. Where else? In bars. In public places? You have a one-track mind. Do you use the services of other men? No, I don't. Marian is the best. He does these things to me... Spare us the details. Why him? - He's not that attractive. - Really? And you think you are? Is 500 zloty your top rate? Depends on the client. My record was 2,000. Per session? Are you interested? Your lawyer is very good. Even if the judge buys your story, who's going to buy yours? You used to work at Philips HQ in the Netherlands. The Deloitte branch. You were a headhunter, not a prostitute. We'll need more people to corroborate your story. No more... actresses. Can you imagine yourself sleeping with women for money? I didn't say I wouldn't take that job. I didn't mean that. It's a theoretical question. Can you imagine that? Would I be allowed to choose? Choose what? The one... ...that I'm supposed to shag. It's them who get to choose. You're a hooker. How much do I charge per shag? What does it matter? - It matters big time! - Are seriously considering it? Why tell me to impersonate the Midnight Cowboy and then get pissed off? I'm not telling you to do that. All I want is an honest... Forget it. - Have some. - No, thanks. Fancy an encore? No charge for you, babe. So... I am to go to the IRS. - Tax Inspection Office. - Right. And tell them that I've been using the services of a hooker for a year. And that you are that hooker. But Marian. I am a prostitute. Have you forgotten? Are we done? - Hi! - Hi, Maja. Come in, please. Why here? My office... ...is being painted. - Fancy a drink? - Tea, please. Of course. There he is! - It's just an act. - Nice butt. - You seriously think he's a hooker? - Can you tell from someone's looks? Do we look like we are? From the IRS? Everything's alright? It's all good. - Good evening. - Good evening. I called earlier. My documents are at my accountant's. I'll give you the number. It's not that. I'd like to ask you about Wydrzycki. I don't have to talk to you. It's none of my business. I had hoped to talk to you in private. In private? I'm organising a trip to Jordan. We'll jump from the Moab towers, buy motorbikes in Egypt and head up the Nile. Coming? No? Bye then. I wonder whether these bikes will be accurately posted in your books? I bet there'll be a mistake. Good, good! Stop! [unintelligible] What? It was a tie. - How's that gigolo of yours? - I found out that he issues invoices. - I'm looking into this scam. - Is he whoring around? - Bullshit. I think he's a coach. - Perhaps he goes to bed with them, too. That's his own business. Would you go to bed with me? - No. - Why's that? - I have a boyfriend. - I have a wife. Let's cheat on them. Let's spar instead. Unless you're too knackered? We already have insurance and cable TV. Hello! I'm here for an invoice. You're Maniek's client, right? Exactly. - Maniek told me to drop in. - Come in, please. - Hanka. - Klara. Can I have your business card? I forgot to bring it. Fill in your details, the amount and I'll send the invoice by mail. Maniek never said he had such a nice wife and kids. He's my brother. - My husband left me. - Don't confide in a stranger. - But she's Marian's friend. - She may be lying. Cheekiness runs in the family. - Beautiful bag. - Do you like it? My most recent work. You made it? I help Marian provide for these half-orphans. - How come? - When my husband left me, I couldn't make mortgage payments. The bank stopped hassling me when Marian began issuing invoices in my name. He forced my husband to sell him the flat. We're not divorced. So I live at my brother's now. But I'll get back on my feet soon. Will your husband ever come back? There's nothing for him to come back to. Is that for me? Thank you. Hi. We could meet in a restaurant. - Like normal people do. - I needed some air. - Are you okay? - Yeah. For you. I can see you've already eaten. I checked out this flat. And the company on the invoices. Some chick lives in the flat, his lover perhaps. Her name is... Wróbel. The firm is registered in her name. Now get this. He bought the flat from her. - No! - Actually, from the Wróbel family. The flat that features on those invoices. He'll weep, just like the baker. Will you come with me to the christening? You'd meet my folks. It's going to be awful! All these aunts and cousins. A scary priest, vodka and schnitzel. We could go to the beach. It's high tide now. We may find some amber. Will there be any kids there? Yes. Catholics baptize small children. Here's the thing. I am allergic to kids' hair. My skin crawls. Thanks. Ready to grill this Wróbel woman? - A Cappuccino, please. - What, now? Why wait? Can't we see her on Monday? I need to buy a gift for the christening. Okay then. Is Artur going with you? No. He moved back to his mum's last night. He looked like a mama's boy to me. Forgive me the bathrobe. My masseur was late. I'll get changed. Unless you're in a hurry? We can start straight away. No, we have plenty of time. Shall I get dressed? I can't eat. I can't sleep. Just to think that this turd may get my Beksiński painting! What could take your mind off this crap? A walk, a movie, a swim? Actually, we had this one... ...session in May when... No. But it really helped. No. - No. - The swimming pool then. Excellent. Get a membership for the whole year. Bye. - Jesus! - What's this? A log of my dates? The next one's in 20 minutes. Do you want the address? Latte with soy milk. The way you like it. You'll need caffeine. Let's go then! Get lost or I'll arrest you for bribing... a public servant. - We're going in the same direction. - Get out! A lighter shade would suit you better. Jesus! - What are you doing?! - Jogging. - From Żoliborz?! - I keep myself fit. You've had enough? Come on! Careful or you'll have a heart attack. I could recuperate at yours. - I'm seeing someone. - Great, maybe I'll finally meet him. Unless he's staying at his mum's tonight. Are you stalking me? Should I be scared? We both know there's chemistry between us. You don't know how to take a joke. But I do. The top dogs are considering several candidates... ...for a manager. It will take some doing to push your case. That's not funny. It wasn't meant to be. Follow me. It's goes perfectly with your jacket. I've got a stall here. I'll show you my new stuff. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Come on. if you like anything, you can swap it for your old bag. This is what sells, not some folksy artsy craft. I'm sure that your mum will sell everything today. She'll be over the moon just to break even. - Hi! - Hi. - Hi, Maniek! - Hi. I was so impressed with our session. I dropped in to get the invoice. You never said you had a sister, paid taxes and helped others. Why did you signal to him to keep quiet? - Me? - Something's going on between you. - It's strictly professional. - Said the butcher to the lamb. It's more than that. You're blushing. Will Klara be joining us for lunch? - There'll be more than just pancakes. - I'm in! - But I... - Come on! I broke even. Let's go in five minutes! You don't say a word. Was the fight over you? No. - How are your sessions going? - Nina! He called me a country bumpkin. We really hit it off. What do you need a coach for? He helps me with... ...stuff. Love life or work? - Love life. - Work. Where do you work? Tell Hania what you do for a living. I am... - ...an accountant. - Great! The IRS is coming down hard on Marian. - They're coming down hard on me. - Could you help? Excuse me. Will you go play? It's my mum. Hi, mum. - He didn't go fishing? - Yeah. He said no to Uncle. I bought him such a nice vest. Family trouble? My dad has been seriously depressed for a month. He can't sleep, eat or fish. Nobody knows why. Perhaps I could find out? How? We'll both go to the christening. I'll talk to him. Why would I let you into my house? You walked into mine without asking. You pose as a friend. - I'll pose as your boyfriend. - No way. What's in it for you? I'll help your father... ...and you'll help my family avoid eviction. Are you trying to bribe me? Yes. - Lunch is ready! - What? It's getting cold. Mum, the train's late. Don't come to the station. I'm with my boyfriend. Yes, he's mine. - He's never been to Kołobrzeg. - But I have. See you later! It's a beautiful city. - Be nice and smile. - Yes, ma' am. Has your dad been under stress? Any health issues? Problems at work? On the contrary. He got promoted to sales manager at the brewery. Don't tell him you're a coach because he won't want to talk to you. As you wish, honey. Hi! Sorry I'm late. What a cute little girl! It's a boy. Let's wait and see. - I wanted to be his godmother, but... - Congratulations! You little Catholic, you! Nobody wanted to give her absolution. Who was that? No idea. Don't forget about us, please. Did he give the five hundred back? As if. He's a great sales rep for Jesus. Or a sales manager. Wacek. Maniek. What do you do? - What do you do for a living? - He studied psychology. - You could do better. - In the Netherlands. Does your spokesperson do all the talking? Are you some kind of a politician? - I am... - He's a coach. - A coach. - A what? A coach. A trainer. - Our basketball team is pretty good. - That's not what I do. People talk to me and I listen. Occasionally, I blurt something out. I send a bill and that's it. I've heard about it. You are an... ...agony aunt. Don't take it personally, but it's... - ...a rip off. - I'm really good at it. I need to talk to you. - What about? - Not here. What is it about? I'd like to marry Klara. Easy. It was a joke. I'm her coach. What's wrong with her? She realized that... ...she still has a conscience and got scared. - And you pay him? - In kind. I was here... ...over twenty years ago. Did you come here with your folks? We might have met. No? Can't you remember? It was 1996. A good looking, sexy... ...student with long hair, wearing a pair of tight red trunks. Nothing? I remember a girl with a bucket. Carrying seawater to a moat. She would build a sand castle, over and over again. A swimsuit with the Mole. Yeah, that was me. What a blast from the past. Let's go. Shall we look for amber? You're not on holidays. You have a job to do, remember? It was your idea. She sang beautifully. She was a revelation at the local talent show. She doesn't sing any more. Not even Christmas carols. She doesn't go fishing anymore. Do you? Has Putin invaded Poland? I'm sure Marian likes plum jam. - What a lovely laugh. - Yeah. Mum! Jadzia was very happy. Are you happy? But of course! I got a pay rise, a secretary and a nice office. How do you like it there? I'm happy as a clam... ...in a fish tank. Keep it in a dark place for at least three months. Remember: half a litre of vodka to one kilo of fruit. - Am I right, Jadzia? - Yes. Don't leave yet. - We'll go fishing. - I've never been in November. - We have a bed big enough for you. - We must go back, dad. See? I told you so. We would go fishing. At his favourite lake. Whenever they wouldn't bite he'd tell me to sing. And what? - He'd always catch something. - No way. - I'm serious. - Amazing. You should do it for a living. Sing for fish. What would you call your band? Klara and the Clarinets? I once thought I'd be the next Ella Fitzgerald. And? I didn't. So it's the great Ella or nothing? Why not a little Betty instead? - What do these chicks pay you for? - Sex. - What are you doing? - And you? - It's Rysiek! - Who? My boss. - Shall we kiss? - Quiet. What if I get fired? What is he doing here? Testing the Pendolino train. They'll be back in the evening. Let's go. - Hi. - Hi. Klara asked me to give you this. For your pancakes. - How was the christening? - It was alright. Do you like her? Who? Guess! She's okay. Where have you been? I had to go out on serious business, no time to mess around. - We must put Wydrzycki away. - Is he a threat to the public? I meant put his case away. - So he's a prostitute then? - Yeah. He slept with all these women. - You wouldn't sleep with me. - What is it with you? And you? First you wanted to rip his head off and now... You can't argue with the facts. I don't feel like spending the next six months in and out of court. - Has he talked you round, too? - Please. You're so impressed with this guy. Don't you sleep with your wife? Give it to me. Only one witness? You're getting lazy. Or there's something else on your mind. See it through. Or I'll have to... ...retrain you. - He refused to drop your case. - Why? He wants to cross-examine you and a new witness. What's the plan? I'll make sure you're prepared. Let's meet somewhere safe. My place then. Only one IRS snoop will know. - Who's that? - You. Your place tomorrow evening. No contact until then. Suddenly, it's World War II again. Did you attract any attention? No. Why? Come in, please. Prostitution has no legal definition. It boils down to three things. No emotional involvement. I don't give a shit about them. That makes you more credible. The sexual nature of the service. You're theirs for two hours. The third hour is free. - You're ready for sex. - They may not be too keen... We keep quiet about that. Will your witness confirm that she wanted to... ...and that the two of you did it? - She will. - An actress? - No. - Will she sound credible? - No amateur dramatics. - You'll be pleased, m'am. Good. Most importantly, we won't see each other again after the interrogation. Not even in disguise? - A chance encounter in Kołobrzeg? - Out of the question. After some time? In five years. When the case is closed. Perhaps then... - But I need to double check. - Five years. Time will pass, right? - Bye then. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Becoming an escort was a good decision. As an interior designer, - you wouldn't do well. - I'll send you a check. This is how I rented it. The previous tenant was... ...an old army doctor. That's a relief. I thought you were a hoarder. Nice collection. I throw these. I read what I've hit. In the loo. Try it. Aim carefully. Catholic through and through. Give me two numbers. 155... ...and 15. Verse 15. "I looked, and behold a pale horse: its rider was named..." "...Death" "and Hell followed with him." The plan for today. Coffee? EATING WELL I'm sorry! Hi! - Ryszard Mróz. - Hi. All these years. Holidays, Beksiński painting... He left me after twenty years. Can you imagine? - I couldn't. - What about sex? You know what Maniek told me to do? To put myself in her shoes. When I did... - You forgave her? - I fucking well did! - And sex? - Here we go again. I do appreciate Wydrzycki's impact on your life... but we're here because he claims he's a prostitute. And a chatty one at that. Simple question. Did you have sex with Mr Wydrzycki? Yes, I did. Can you... ...prove it somehow? How? Well, maybe he has... ...a distinguishing mark? Yes. - A birthmark. - Where?! Looks kind of weird. Better get that... checked. I can't talk now, mum. He did what? Did you sleep with her? - You did. - Just once, a long time ago. - Her husband had just left her. - How could you! She must have been a wreck. And she was your client! You slept with your... suspect. Not everything is... - So I took advantage of you? - No, it's just that... - Sometimes things get out of control. - I've been such a fool. - It's not like that. - Oh really? Actually, I don't want to hear it. Just go. Get out! My father says hi. How is he? He gave up that promotion. Well done. My congratulations. I have an invitation for Klara. Great. Will you give it to her? No. What have you done this time? Nothing. Aga! Wait! Shall I fetch you some coffee? No, thanks. - Has Wydrzycki been here today? - No, why? - Just asking. - I miss him, too. I'd keep tailing him if I were you. Kids, now the magician will show you some tricks. The magic show is off. The magician got dumped and she's had a few too many. I could show them a three-card trick. Or play a shell game for their pocket money. Hi, Bartek! Who's the birthday boy? - I am. - Happy birthday! This is for you. Hi! Great to see you. It's a bit of a mess, but we're having fun. - Hi. - Hi. No, thanks. Hi, kids. I will show you all a trick and tell you about a prince who turned out to be an ordinary... She's totally plastered. And the kids will strangle that one... with guitar strings. So let's do something about it instead of joking. Hi, kids! I'll sing you a song, alright? It's an old song, but you may like it. ♪ Children get bored when it's raining ♪ ♪ It's a well-known fact ♪ ♪ They tire less and make less mess ♪ ♪ But they get terribly bored ♪ ♪ Dear little ones ♪ ♪ They torment little flies ♪ ♪ And rip the pillows to shreds ♪ ♪ Yet they're terribly bored ♪ ♪ Kids during rain ♪ ♪ Are a bit of a pain ♪ ♪ Don't let the rain ♪ ♪ Drive them insane and remember that ♪ ♪ Children get bored when it rains ♪ ♪ It's a well-known fact ♪ ♪ They tire less and make less mess ♪ Well done! You missed your true calling. Great outfit. Why are you here? I was passing by when I saw you. I couldn't believe my eyes. Klara and Marian! What a coincidence! What do you want from us? - How long have you been an item? - Be quiet. Let's go outside. But it's snowing. Am I interrupting quality family time? - Will you cut the cake, Marian? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Ryszard Mróz. - I'm Klara's colleague. - Hanka. - How old are you now? - Three. - Leave the kids out of it. - Isn't their uncle a pro? Pardon? That's what he told us at the Tax Office. Maybe that's why they got so close. A cliché, I know. You think it's funny? - I just got fired. - We'll work it out. What? Look what you've done to me, your family and yourself. And you're crap at fighting. - Nina's right. I'm too gullible. - No, you're not. Listen... I'm sorry. Dear kids! Mariola is fucking awesome. She will show you a trick. Guess what animal this is. Where are the kids? I love you! Love me! Was it worth it? You could've shagged... your handsome boss, got promoted and lived a happy life. Shame. - My notice. - No need for that. It's a disciplinary dismissal. I'll notify the Prosecutor's Office. I could sue you for assault, but... ...I'm not the vindictive type. What will happen to Ma... ...to Wydrzycki? He'll pay what he owes. - He did it for his sister. - How touching! - Her kids will end up on the street. - I understand. Perhaps... I could... ...help or turn a blind eye, but... ...not for free. - Fuck! - We've known each other for years. - We could meet. - Only joking! Bribing a guy with your pussy... What a turnoff! - You called? - Right on time. Here's the youngest manager in the history of our office. You'll prepare a report on Wydrzycki's case for the Prosecutor's Office. We'll get rid of corrupt individuals. You can go pack your things. Hi. I was looking for an excuse. It could be either a toothbrush or boxer shorts. But the truth is... ...that I've simply missed you. I'm starting a new job on Monday. In that company we talked about. If you want, I'll go to that christening with you. - Did you call her? - No. Why not? You're too young to understand. That she beat up her boss for you - and all you do is mope around? - It's complicated. I need my darts. - A giant jigsaw puzzle is complicated. - I screwed it up. She does not want to see me. I was proud of you when you fought. Stay away, you fucking nutcase! I'll withdraw my statement. Just leave Klara alone. I'll go after you both, darling! ...ninety six years old, smokes, drinks cognac... and eats boiled sweets. I've finally met your sparring partner. I thought he was having an affair. And boxing was just a cover-up. Aren't you taking it too far? This neck brace... ...a black eye. Male bonding, right? Good you came, bro. We need to have a word. Do you mind, sweetheart? I'll see you on Wednesday. Wednesday? We made a date. A session. - Drop in for tea or anything else. - You bet I will. - Beautiful flat. I'm impressed. - Thank you. "Anything else". - You'll end up on the street. - Perhaps. I'll coach your wife first. I can be persuasive. - I'll fucking kill you! - Leave Klara alone. - Recant and cancel the session. - I sure will. - Now piss off. - Of course. - Never show your face here again! - I'm going. - What's this? - Termination by agreement. A copy for her. Will you sign it or not? Mr Wydrzycki's attorney has arrived. - Who? - His attorney. Good morning. Michał Kurnik. - Your client has withdrawn his statement. - Good. He has always been prone to exaggeration and had a penchant for drama. Pardon? He metaphorically described the services he provides as part of his sister's business. Here's a complete documentation proving that he runs a household together with his sister who is a sole trader registered as... Mr Wydrzycki. Sign here, please. We will review your case within two weeks. - Is that all? - No. What else shall I do? Find Clara, buy her flowers, marry her, give her a baby or be more original. The fucker got himself quite a lawyer. There is nothing to pick on. Only some overdue insurance payments. - Do you think she slept with him? - Yes. - Is Klara home? - No. Where is she? Far away from here. Over a river and through the woods... - Want some? - What river? The Baltic Sea. - Has she gone? - She's taking a ferry to Sweden. "On a steamboat cruise." When does it sail? Focus, man. Today, from Gdynia. "On a steamboat cruise"... Hi. It's Klara Matysiak. For work emergencies, please contact Agnieszka Krawczyk. Are you sure you want to do this? - Yes. - That's what matters. Work isn't everything. - That's not what mum says. - She'll get over it. When I gave up that promotion, she was hysterical. - Do you regret it? - Regret what? A desk? A secretary? A few more quid? You need to have a reason to get up in the morning. Do you? Ask me tomorrow. What about Marian? I'd like to book a ticket for the ferry to Karlskrona. For today. I know it's short notice. One moment, please. Just a sec. Please wait. AV... 99... 88 You're alive, you... you... ...you little dog, you! I will run you and your whole family over! - Good evening. Miss Klaudia... I'm waiting for a friend. Has she checked in? I'm afraid I may not share this information. It's very important. - I cannot help you. - I get it. That's okay. Rules are rules. Let's do it this way. If she's not on board, you'll say "I may not share this information". - And if she is on board... - I may not share this information. You may not share this, or she's not on board? Is this the only ferry leaving from Gdynia today? Thank you. Have you seen this... ...blonde? A whiskey, please. Farid Morocco
