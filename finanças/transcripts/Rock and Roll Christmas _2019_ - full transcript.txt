Mother and manager,plotting against daughter? Wow, that's dramatic. Bonnie didn't have anythingto do with this. That's right. I am no glutton for punishment. (scoffs) There it is. That's the laugh that tells meexactly where to go. Yeah, still the martyr I see. That was amazing. We were hoping you'dsign an album for our silent auction. Oh, I'd love to. Sure Todd. So, I understand our ex-drummer, or would you prefer ex-husband, is on tour with Zombie Grease. I prefer neither from you. Zombie Grease makes sense. He is brain dead. But you know gotta giveit to him. It's a big tour. Ladies, can we make it a littlemore sugar plum and a little less EbeneezerScrooge? BOTH: Bah humbug. Can we at least keep it down so we don't make more headlines? Okay, let it all out. Well I would say thatI'm surprised by your audacity but being that you've beenmanaging my mother for 25 years obviously your scruples areoutta whack. You know what, I am gonna gofind my daughter. Mom, that was amazing. Riley, you're beautiful. Thanks. You can call me Grandmaor Bonnie. Whatever you want. Grandma. Oh shoot. Oh, I haven't held you sinceyou were so little. Why is that, Ashlyn? I don't know, Mother. My number's still the same. Huh, mine is too. Well, there's no time likethe present to make up for lost time. Go sit in the truck, Bret-- Please just hear me out. I've got some good news. Look, I hope you can find it inyour frosted old hearts to forgive me but itwas the only way to get you two in thesame place. Your old record label wantsa Roses reunion. We all do. BONNIE AND ASHLYN:No! I thought you'd say that. People used to love the Roses. Oh well. They still love the Roses. I uploaded a video ofyour performance and it already has 100,000 hits. Wow. Well, there ya go. And... This is what they're willingto pay. Wow. Hmm. People want to see you again. They really are somethingwhen they're on the same page. Well we were when your mom letme take care of business. More like micromanage my life. I just wanted you to share thegifts God gave you. Not let them fall like pineneedles off a Christmas tree just because you madea big mistake. So, tell me a little bitabout yourself. Do you play an instrument or? I mean I could teach you someof the songs we have. RILEY: I'm not much of a singerbut I love playing. That's nice. Okay, you know what? This has all been a lot. I think it's about timefor Riley and I to go home. Not many people get asecond chance to share their gift withthe world. At least agree to come bymy office tomorrow. We can go over the restof the details. I-- Mom, you have to. Fine. I will come by to listento the details. But seriously, Riley, it's timefor us to go home. Good to see ya again, Ashlyn. ASHLYN: Yeah, you too, Bret. RILEY: Bye Grandma. (gentle music) Don't even try. Would you get my things? I'm gonna go sit in the truck. (playful music) Riley Rose! Breakfast is ready,come on down! Okay, I'm dying to know,how does it look? What do you think? It's hard to mess up breakfast so I wouldn't get toohigh on the hog. I will take that asa compliment. My early Christmas gift to you. Speaking of Christmas,what do you want this year? So for once I actually knowwhat I want. Okay, let's hear it. Don't worry, it's not expensive. Well that's good. Okay, what is it? I want Grandma. Uh, what do you mean? I want to spend Christmaswith Grandma. I just want us to be afamily, that's all. There's a lotta history there. Well yeah, she's your mom. Yeah but it's a lot morecomplicated than that. You always tell me howshort life is and how I should chasemy dreams. This is all I want this year. (Ashlyn sighs) (bright music) Okay, are you ready foryour warm ups? (laughing) Look, you're an internet star. Well that's a new one,even for me. That is a lot of views! Yeah, it is. How do you get all those views? Oh, you know,when people share it. Share. That's a new concept. (bright music) How you holding up, Bon? That was some stunt you pulled. I shoulda told ya. But I knew if I did,you wouldn't show. She broke my heart when she quitthe Roses and ran off with that Beau. I know. We had such a good thing goingand she just, she left for some hair brainedidea that-- Love. People do some crazy things. Risk a lot for love. Um hmm. And once his meal ticketdried up, he was gone. Just like I said he'd be. I know that too. I was there through it all. Remember? I know. You were a faithful managerand friend. But if we do this again it's got to be different. ASHLYN: You can say that again. Oh, I love that we agreeon something. I didn't give ya a properhello last night. ASHLYN: Hey Bret. Good to see ya. You too. Okay ladies, to your corners. So, have you given some thoughtto the proposal? Question, what exactly do theywant for this offer? A Christmas EP. Two classic Christmas songsand one original. A new one? This says we only havea few weeks. Yep. They want to release the songson Christmas Eve. (Bonnie sighs) I think it's a great offer. Especially considering yourillustrious solo careers. Oh! Okay fine. I'll do it. But then I go my way. And I go mine. Great. So I've lined you up withSmith Carter. He's the hottest producer inthe industry right now. I've also got you a photo shootfor the promo kit and a one to one interview. Wow. That didn't take long. I might be grayer but I canstill make things happen. Well I think you lookdistinguished. Thank you. Um hmm. (happy music) You must be Smith. Ms. Rose. It's really great to meet you. Looking forward to digginginto this with the both of you. Cool, great. ASHLYN: Mother. Ashlyn. Riley, I'm so glad you came! I'm Smith. Hi, I'm-- The Ashlyn Rose. I dropped the "the" years ago. This is my daughter Riley. Hey. You're here to keep thesetwo in line? I do what I can but I makeno promises. (all chuckling) So what do you have plannedfor your original? I can only imagine what you haveafter all this time. We don't actually have anythingwritten yet. Oh, okay. Then let's tackle theother two songs. What classics have you chosen? Well, we haven't, yet. We could always do"Little Drummer Boy". (sighs)That's been doneto death. Then by all means, whydon't you choose. Smith, would you please putus out of our misery and choose a song? Anything but the"Little Drummer Boy". Okay, how 'bout"Hark the Herald Angels Sing"? Been working on a more modern,upbeat version that I think you might like. I've got a rough instrumentationto use as a guide track. If you wanna hear it? -Let's do it.-Cool. (Bonnie chuckles) BONNIE: Let's go. Here it comes. (bright music) Do you wanna take that? -Yeah. -Then I'll take? Then I'll go? -Yep.-Okay. All right, we can go. (bright music) ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ Joyful all ye nations rise ♪ Join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ With angelic hosts proclaim ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ Glory to the newborn king Yeah? (applauding) That was amazing. It's okay, you can be happy. I'm just happy you're happy,sweetheart. Any notes? No. That was perfect. Let's call it a day while I playaround with the mix. Meanwhile you both can figureout the next song you wanna do. Sounds good. And Ashlyn, I was hoping you'dcome in another time to lay down some guitar. I'm gonna add a second guitarto make it pop. I was thinking maybe somethinglike this. (bright guitar music) That was great. Yeah, really something. But you know, we oughtaget going because we've got alotta work to do and we gotta get up early for aninterview in the morning. So. Hey Riley, we should talkabout(whispers). It was really great tomeet you, Smith. You too. (gentle music) So the studio and theupcoming tour that we're looking forward to. I mean there's a lot comingdown the pike. Stick to the music. Personal lives off limits. Agreed. And here they are. The Roses. BONNIE AND ASHLYN: Hi. -Ashyln.-Nice to meet you. Hi there, I'm Bonnie. -Nice to meet you.-Nice to meet you too. Let's get right into it. ASHLYN: Okay. How does it feel seeing howpopular the video of your performance was? I think we were both alittle shocked. Yes, I don't think we realized how loyal our fans were afterall these years. We were very touched. It must feel great being backin the studio and recording. Well there is no placeI'd rather be, honestly. It's like we never stopped. Yes. But you did stop. For about 15 years whenyou both pursued rather disappointing solocareers. Is that what brought you backtogether as a duo? Well our retirement waspretty public. So it just felt right for theRoses to come back. Um hmm. Bonnie, how do you reconcilewith the fact that Ashlyn walked awayfrom the Roses and broke up the band? Well we try not to dwellon the past. I mean it was tough,but that was then. Hmm. Ashlyn, your mom can be quoted saying that she didn't like BeauNiland, your ex-husband. Thank you. I know who Beau Niland is. She called you silly,young and impulsive. Have you worked through thosedifferences? Well you know, mothers alwaysthink they know best. And sometimes they do. Yeah and as a daughter, you just really want your motherto be there for you and it's disappointing whenshe's not. And it's painful you know, when you hear through the press of your daughter's engagement and subsequent departure fromthe band. Hmm. How will it be differentthis time? Okay, I thank you foryour questions. It looks like you got whatyou came for. We're on a very tight deadline and the Roses need to practice. Are you guys dating anyone? Did you get all that? Well that was a disaster. And yet I'm not surprisedat all. You could've controlled yourselfa little more, Ashlyn. Oh, so now you're blamingme, again. You never wanna hear the truth. Not about Beau, not aboutyourself. Because you're such a greatjudge of character, mother. Hey, we can work through this. No press is bad press, right? ASHYLN: No thanks. This was never going towork, Bret. Yeah. At least we can agree on that. (thoughtful music) (sighs) BEAU: Hey, I'm probablysomewhere making music. Leave a message. Hey Beau, I'm sure you're offliving your best life. But could you please send the child support for ourdaughter that she needs? So if you could sendthe money ASAP that would be great. Thanks. (sighs) Riley. What's going on? Why couldn't you just get along? I barely started toget to know her and you blow it up in one day. Riley, what happened betweenyour grandmother and I, there's a long history there and I don't know that things will ever be the samebetween us. I'm sorry. So when you told me you would doeverything you could to get me what I wantedfor Christmas, you meant only if it wascheap and easy? No, Riley, these are grownup problems and you are not privy toall the details that made it not workout between us. Didn't work out? Mom, me not getting thepart of Tiny Tim in the school Christmas playdidn't work out. This is way bigger. This is just you being stubborn. Riley, wait! (sighs) (door lock jangles) Riley come on. Please, you know the rules. No locked doors. Just leave me alone. (sad music) (soft guitar music) Hello? Yeah. Hi, yes the guitaris still available. Sure, 10 o'clock tomorrow works. 6 Onetree Lane. (gasps)But I have dogs. Big dogs. I hope you're not allergic. Okay. No. No I cannot get Bonnie Roseto sign the guitar. Ashyln is. Do you want the guitar or not? Great. See you tomorrow. (sighs) (doorbell rings) (thoughtful music) (sighs) Wow, you sure know how to makea guy feel special. I'm sorry, I thought you mightbe Ashlyn or Riley. Have you heard from eitherof them? No, I have not. So I don't know whatto tell you. I guess the whole thing's off. Turns out time heals pretty muchnothing with that girl. Come in. Nope. Put your jacket on. You're coming with me. Bret, would I go out atthis hour? 'Cause you're not sitting aroundbrooding all night. I am taking you to dinner. Bret-- I know you Bonnie Rose and I know being along inthis house is not doing you any good. It's Christmas time. Let's go enjoy it. Come on. (bright music) Let me get my jacket. I thought that bringing Ashlynback into your life would make ya happy again. I thought you two would find away to work things out, you know 'tis the seasonand all. Um hmm. Well sometimes things can'tbe worked out. They just gotta be workedthrough. So how long before you reachout this time? What? As far as I'm concerned,the ball is in her court. How do ya figure? (sighs)Look, I can'tdo this again. I mean all I did wascare for her. You know I mean I knew whatwas best for her as her mother and herbusiness partner and I did the best I could. She picked the loserand I'm the bad guy? No, I can't do it again. To be fair, you have picked aloser too, as well. (laughs)You must thinkthe sun wakes up just to hear you crow. I'm just saying everyone makesmistakes. Okay, well thank you wise one. Everyone makes mistakes. Let's drop it. ♪ The herald angels sing Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. It's Christmas. Joy tends to lurk inevery corner. I'm about 10 seconds awayfrom a meltdown. ♪ God and sinner reconciled ♪ Joyful all ye nations rise Thank you, if you could keepmoving along, we'd appreciate it. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.-Thanks! That wasn't so hard, was it? I'm gonna need dessert. I'm gonna need more wine. Those carolers reminded meof that time we got caught in the snowstorm after the Philadelphia show. -Oh yeah.-Remember? It's like they appeared outof nowhere, little Christmas angels whokept us company until the snow plow came. Remember we called it snow jam? (laughing) Oh. Aw. You're a great man, Bret. You really are. Cheers. (doorbell rings) (sighs) Smith. I'm, I'm confused. Well this is awkward. I was given this addressto pick up a guitar that was once yours. Was that you? Well I guess betteryou than a stranger. Come on in. Wow, I can't believeyou're selling Rosie. With all the artistsyou've produced, what makes you want this guitar? (Smith sighs) (gentle music) My mom, she was a hugefan of the Roses. And I guess I was, am too. I figured it'd be a greataddition to my collection. Especially because we'reworking together now. So, what's up? Well, sometimesyou have to let go of the things that youlove for the greater good. So. Wait. You can't. You're not ready. You're right. She's been with me fromthe beginning. I'm sorry if you're ina tough spot. I mean, if that's what it is. I'll figure it out. Just do me a favor,don't tell anyone, especially not my mom. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I guess it's just fakeit 'til ya make it. And then fake it againin my case. Ashlyn, there's nothing fakeabout you. (soft guitar music) Is that Riley playing? Yeah. She plays a little. And she sings too. Just like you. She's a really good kid. She just really wantsmy mom around and I messed that up. That was over sharing. No, no, it's nice to see behindthe curtains. Adds context to the art. I just wish I could do somethingto help you both finish the record. I appreciate that. But when my mom digsher heels in, you know that sayingwild horses. What? Well it seems to me that maybe stubbornness runsin the family. Maybe. So maybe it wouldn't beso terrible if you gave it another try. Maybe. And maybe Riley would likeit if you did too. And so would I. All right, all right. I give. So I'll see you at thestudio then? Bring Rosie. ASHLYN: Thank you. Really. Just doing my job.

You both still have it. It took me back to a specialplace in my childhood. Was there ever a doubt? Mom! I'm just, I'm just kidding. I mean there was probablylegitimate doubts that we would even showup today. It felt good out there. It really did. We should talk about youroriginal. And considering the timeconstraints, I took the liberty of writinga little something that I hope you might like. Let's hear it. (energetic guitar music) Wow, that was amazing. I think I'm beginning to get inthe Christmas spirit. Yeah, you're quite thetalent, Smith. Glad you like it. So, let's try and get back inthe studio in a few days and we'll knock this outtathe park. Yeah, but in the meantime weshould get out of your hair so you can work your voodoo tomake us sound fabulous. SMITH: Hey Ashlyn. Yeah? Would you like to goout tonight? Talk about guitars over dinner. Oh wow. I would love to, but I haveto pick up Riley and then we do homeworkand dinner. That sort of thing. Right. Well hey, maybe you couldcome to a gig I have tomorrow. If you have time. I literally don't stay uppast 11 o'clock. It's the exciting life of a mom. Well it's at 3 o'clock. So you'll be home by dinner. Who has a gig at 3 o'clockin the afternoon? I do.

Oh I felt more than oneset of eyes burning a hole in theback of my head. I mean I feel lucky that Ijust got outta there in one piece. So you must've always had amusical Christmas then. We did. Back when I was 20, but my mom, she passed away unexpectedly. I'm so sorry. Thank you. What was she like? Oh God, she was amazing. (chuckling) What resonates with me most isjust how selfless she was. She'd always remind meto consider what the person next to mewas going through before I got caught upin my own life. -There you go.-Thank you. -Yes, thank you.-Enjoy. What? She loved, I mean reallyloved the Roses. Every Christmas we would listento your albums on repeat. She'd be crazed to know I'mproducing your album. That's so sweet. I'm just happy that we could be a part of yourmemories with her. Yeah you know I guessI just learned to appreciate what you havewhile you have it. 'Cause you never know. That is really good advice.

Sometimes life's justa big ol' mess. Okay, well I will help youdecorate the tree if you wanna help me bakecookies for my school fundraiser. Deal. And I was thinking maybeyou could join us at the photo shoot tomorrow. Grandma will be there. A photo shoot? Talk about needing help. You just need me there todo your makeup. Oh really?

I think it's great thathe's here. Get him in some promo shots. Uh huh. Ashlyn, you look great. You look fantastic. Thank you, Mother. You know, you might wannarethink the lipstick. It's okay, I'm sure theycan change it. Here we go. What? I'm just saying. Just saying that you have tohave your two cents on everything in my life. Actually you are both wearingthe wrong shade of lipstick. And you are not highlighted orcontoured nearly enough. Don't worry, I can fix it. Let's go Roses. Lead the way. I had no idea I needed tobrighten my eyes. And this is not a colorI would normally use. Do you trust me? Of course I do. I would say you're mygo to girl.

Let's do a family photo. Three generations. And the manager. For some reason. So, me and my mom are bakingChristmas cookies after this. Do you wanna come over and help? Are you kidding? Love to. ASHLYN: That's a nice shot. If it's okay with yourmom of course. Everyone put a hand up. Come on. Who wants to help usbake cookies? (Bret chuckles) Okay, well I guess everyone'scoming over to bake some cookies. Mom, would you like to join us? I would love to. I gotta get these photos tothe label, but I volunteer to be theofficial tester. (laughs)I will save you some. Sneaky. (happy music) These are so good. Your mom and I baked thoseevery single year. One of my earliest Christmasmemories is of us making these cookies. It was a mandatory Christmastradition. It was. Sprinkles were here favoritething. Maybe that's why it's theonly thing that I'm actually good at makingin the kitchen. But you were always overmy shoulder making sure I followed therecipe to the letter. Well there are rules tobe followed to get the desired results. Oh, with cookies of course. Of course. Among other things. Wow, this is pretty cool. Where'd you get it? I gave that to Ashlyn after ourfirst show together. Oh the song is-- First Noel. Yeah, I know it well. It's my mom's favorite. Oh. It was the first song that Ashlyn and I ever sangtogether on stage. ASHLYN: That was a good show. It was a good show. (chuckling) What's up Riles? It's Dad. He just texted me. Oh boy. What'd he say? His tour is bringing backthrough town on Christmas Eve. And he wants to hangout with me. Oh, he's calling. Hi Dad. No. Excuse me? It's not your decision. Well then it's my opinion,you should say no. He's her father. If she wants to have arelationship with him then she can make that decision. Ashlyn, it's your jobto protect her. Protect her from her father? From everything. Your father wanted to see youagain after he left, but I protected you. Dad actually wanted to see me? Maybe I should go too. No stay, this won't take long. He only came back when the Rosesstarted to take off. He didn't care about us. He cared about the money. I can't believe you kepthim away from me. It's more like I kept him frombreaking your heart again. It wasn't your decision to make. I was the one who raised you. I was the one who kept you safe. Safe from him, safe fromall those people that could've taken advantage ofyou in the music industry, it was you and me. (sighs) 'Til that drummer swooped in and took you away from meanyway, didn't he? That drummer was my husband. And the father to my beautifuldaughter. He actually saw something in me that you never wanted to see. He actually encouraged me todo what I wanted to do. And what was that? To find my own identity, one outside of being oneof the Roses. You were suffocating me. Hmm, well pardon me for wantingthe best for you. Maybe it's not the besttime to take-- You know, this is none ofyour business. You know, we don't needany of this. That's just what youwant, right? To get out from under my thumb. (door slams) (sighs) Well, maybe she'll bejust like you and not talk to youfor 15 years. You guys are unbelievable. Just as bad as the tabloidssaid. Riley was happy all day today. We all were. I was wrecked when I lostmy mom and grandma. Riley has you both butneither of you can look past your own nosesto see what you have. Your music, it brings joy topeople. To me, even. But I gotta say,you pretty much do the exact opposite to everyonearound you. Smith. (sighs) Your turn. (laughs) (sad, thoughtful music) (sighs) Riley. Too soon. Come on Riles. We shouldn't have got intoit like that. Riley come on. Please, no locked doors. I'm sorry. (sighs) (phone buzzes) Hey Bret. Hey to you. Got the proofs back onthe photos. They're incredible. You and Ash have copiesin your inbox. So many good ones we can use. I even got a favorite. -Listen.-You see the chemistry between you two in every shot. It's nice seeing you guysgetting along so well. -About that.-What? Oh please don't tell me there'sa problem. (sighs)Well-- Christmas Eve is in three days. What are you doing? Are you available right now? Don't answer that. I'm coming over. I--(phone beeps) Bret? (sighs) What are you so happy about? (playful music) Okay Christmas angel, could you please send me someof your Christmas joy? I sure could use it right now. (knocking at door) Tell me all about it. We can fix this. I don't know what to say. I'm just really sorry. (sighs) We were doing so well. I thought maybe we could get,you know close again. You both gave it a good effort. Oh, she's just so stubborn. What? Now I want you to take thiswith all the care with which it is intended. Spit it out. Ashlyn is indeed a verystubborn woman. Well cheers to that. And so are you. -I beg your pardon?-Oh come on, Bonnie. You're two peas in a pod. Even if the pod bursts apart. Same stubborn thoughts that arerunning through your head are running through hers. I have a question for you andI want you to be honest. More honest than I've been? Well let's say as honest asyou've been so far. Okay. (sighs)Am I overbearing? (thoughtful music) (sighs) I think you love hard. And yes, it can come acrossas overbearing. I know where your heart is,but sometimes I can imagine it can be hard for othersto see. Well I don't know anyother way to be. Truth is, she's as independentas you are. So naturally she pullswhen you push. Who died and made you therelationship expert? (chuckling) I wouldn't sayI'm a relationship expert. But, I'm pretty sureI'm a Bonnie expert. I'll give you that. I just pushed really hard tomake this happen. Well let's just say yourreputation's preceded you and people are just afraid to let you back on the samestage together again. Think about it, I literallyhad to trick you into performing with yourown daughter. And vice versa. You must see how ridiculousthat is. I didn't ask you to do that. Of course not. You gals are the ones withthe talent. I just wanted you to see howspecial what you have is. I don't need your help, Bret. I didn't say you did, Bon. (sighs)Is that why you cameover here tonight, to let me know that this reunionidea of yours was like some sort of a favor? Look, Bonnie, slow down. I'm here because I wanna be. Because this grand scheme ofyours has failed. I kinda stuck my neck out here. In more ways than one. I didn't ask you to do that. I learned a long, long time ago that the only person that Ican rely on is myself. Bonnie Rose, I've known youfor 22 years. 22. And I've done everythingI can to show you how important you are to me. Now you tell me one time,just one when I've let you down. Right. Goodnight Bonnie. (sighs) Nice job, Ashlyn. Hmm. ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and mild Bonnie. I'm not here to argue orcause trouble. We're all professionals. Okay. There's a lot of workto be done. And there are a lotta buttson the line, not just mine and Ashlyn's. I know. Okay, good. So, what do you have in mind? I was thinking that maybeI could come in and record my part and thenAshlyn could come in and record hers andthen we could, you know get this done withoutall the contention. Let me take a look at the song and I'll see what I can do inthe timeframe we have. Well, we don't necessarilyhave a song. Of course you don't. What's that supposed to mean? Well because that would require the both of you working togetherfor more than a day or two. Which in hindsight,seems impossible. (sighs) ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and mild (playful music) Have a good day atschool, Riley! (sighs) (phone dings) (sighs) (happy music) Now we wait. -Hi.-Hey. I wanted to apologize. I'm... I'm sorry.

We're all professionals andwe're here to record a song. Right? Right. Absolutely. So, you both ready to record thesong you don't have?

And Ash...Lyn, Ashlyn, well you've always been so greatwith your poetic lyrics, maybe we could start with that. Sure, I've got the beginning ofsomething we can use. -Okay.-Okay.
