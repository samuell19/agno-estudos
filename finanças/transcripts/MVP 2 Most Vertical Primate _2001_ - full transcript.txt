Welcome back, hockey fans. If you're just joining us, we're broadcasting live from the ZHL Draft, here in beautiful Anchorage, Alaska. For those of you at home, keeping score, we've completed the first 10 rounds. That's right. And the deal-making behind the scenes has been fast and furious. The general managers for both, the LA Carjackers and the Seattle Simians have just brokered a deal. LA star center man Rob Poirier has been traded for the Seattle Simians' first rounder, Sergei Bubalochov. Along with the trade for Poirier, I would have to say, Bruce, that the Simians' choices thus far have been interesting, to say the least. Now, another of the Simians' new acquisitions is goaltender Max "Mad Dog" Brady from the Sault Ste. Marie Buccaneers. Mad Dog! Mad Dog! Mad Dog! Then, there's Tyson Fowler. Some of you hardcore hockey fans may not know his name but he's actually the reigning World Figure Skating Champion. Fowler surprised the sports world by announcing his retirement from figure skating to pursue his life-long dream of playing professional hockey. And don't forget the Swedish sensation, Olaf Schikedanz. Olaf! Olaf! Olaf! Well, certainly, Seattle Simians will be an interesting team to watch. You're right there, Bruce. Jack? Louie? Jack! Louie! And now we're going back live to the draft. - That's right, Clark. - Just in time, too. Bud Fulton, the GM and owner of the Seattle Simians, is about to make his final pick. Hope you boys aren't watching TV again. Where are you two? Jack! Louie! This player was a scoring sensation with the Junior B Nelson Golden Nuggets. Hey! He led the team to victory in last year's Harvest Cup Championship. Jack... Louie... You have until three to open this door. One... Two... Two and a half... Two and three-quarters... It is my distinct pleasure to announce that the final pick for the Seattle Simians in this year's ZHL Draft... So this is where you boys have been hiding. ...is Jack. Oh, come on! Jack! They mean you? Are you sure this is what you really wanna do? Oh, Jack, we're gonna miss you. Jack? Welcome to Seattle! I'm Leo. Coach sent me to get you. I think you're gonna like Seattle. Through there? Ah, come in, come in. Ah! Ha-ha! Leo! How's our new player doing? Mr. Fulton, Jack. Jack, Mr. Fulton. Pleased to meet you, Jack. You can call me Bud. Uh... I think you're gonna need this. Welcome to the Simians, Jack. Now, Jack, I wanna introduce you to the rest of the players and your coach. All right! Nice shot! Hey, Coach! Your new player has arrived. You mean mascot, don't you? Oh, no, no! Jack's a real player. Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Jack. Your new teammate. Looks like your girlfriend, Tony. Gnarly. Would you like a hotdog? Jack's gonna be wearing number 99 and a half. Come on, Jack. Let's get you suited up. We're never gonna evolve as a team with a monkey. He can't be serious. Look, it's Fulton's idea. I have no intention of playing him. I'm not gonna be made a fool of. If he's on the ice tonight, I won't be. You got it? Well, here we are, back at the first ever Seattle Simians game. Yes, and it's been a disappointing game so far, Bruce. Simians are down, two to nothing. - Come on, Simians! - Start playing hockey! Get your popcorn, peanuts here. Bring back the Zamboni driver. Peanuts? You guys stink! Well, the crowd certainly isn't happy after that last goal. Here we go. Face off at center ice, Poirier wins the draw... Poor Jack, he's still on the bench. Oh, and that's a picture-perfect goal! Oh! Let's go, guys! Come on, get the lead out, you losers! Way to work, boys. Way to work. I like it. Yes! Yes! Yes! Give me that. - Miller. - Miller. Fans look unhappy. Bad business to have unhappy fans. It's only the first game. I can see the headlines already. Put Jack in. You gotta be kidding. And that's an order. Hey, Coach. What, are you ordering fries? Jack. You're up. Wow! I can't believe it! They're putting him on! It looks like Miller is sending Jack onto the ice! Miller! Didn't know your kid could play hockey! Hey, look, they're putting in Jack. Hey, over there! Look, look! Hey, your player needs a shave! He's on? He looks like a real swinger, this one. Is that a monkey? I told you, I'm not gonna be on the ice with a monkey. It's Fulton's call. Let's show them, huh? You can do it, Jack! Hey, somebody paint the puck yellow. He'll think it's a banana. Hey, little monkey! Jack, I'm open! He scored! Jack fed Fowler a beautiful pass reminiscent of a close relative, number 99. All right, Carjackers. Enough monkeying around. Let's show these Simians who's in charge of the ice. Guy's good. Jack, pass me the puck! Jack passes it out front to Schikedanz, shoots and scores! Yay! We scored! I'm out of here. And here come the Simians again, Jack's got the puck, moving up ice to Fowler now... And what the heck is Fowler doing out there? I think it was a double-axle, Bruce. Somebody hit fancy feet! And that's three assists for Jack. He is putting on quite a show! Ha-ha, sorry, I didn't mean that. Jack, happy birthday. I got ya. Oh, you. He shoots. He scores! Right at the buzzer, and the Simians win! - Ah! Champagne! - Champagne! You guys think it's okay to be beaten by a chimp? 'Cause I sure as heck don't! Nice game, guys, nice game! One question. Excuse me, guys. Out of my way. Hey, Poirier, did you leave the ice early tonight because of Jack? Well, let me ask you. Would you play with a monkey? Well, I think it'll be a great first season for the Simians. We've assembled an excellent team to the draft, and we have a very effective secret weapon. Jack, pass me the puck. Come on, I'm open! I'm not open anymore. Let's get that monkey. Jack, look out! He's okay! High five! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Do I have any lice? Does Jack do shiatsu? Jack can hear him call that? - That was me. - Bananas, man. Poirier is on net with a breakaway. He spins, goes the back way... Oh! Oh! It's off the post. Excuse me, guys, get out of the way. Forget about it, guys. It's just Poirier. See if we can get a reaction out of this guy. Hey! Number 11! Hey. Rob Poirier. Well, Rob, did you ever think you'd get, uh, chumped by a chimp? ♪ I'm all smiles... Another chocolate? Sure. Make it a double. ♪ I don't need... ♪ Hey, excuse me, are you one of the Simians? Well, we were wondering if you could get Jack to autograph something for us. You have a king? Go fish. Do you have an ace? Sorry. You know, I gotta tell you, Clark, I have not seen hockey fans this excited about a player. Jack's popularity has not stopped rising. Daddy misses you too, sweetheart. Good night. This your family? Guess I never thought about a chimp having a family before. Hey, Jack, what are you up to tonight? Two chocolate shakes with cherries. Thanks. I'm hoping I get traded back to Los Angeles next year. So I can be with my family. Hey, kids. You wanna meet Jack? Oh, dude, that's awesome! Thanks. Sweet. Yeah! Get your bananas here! We got fresh bananas here! Sorry. Over here! Over here! Yeah! Okay, Jack, so now that we have the quad down, let's try a sit-spin. I'm doing it, Fowler, look at me, I'm spinning. How's it going, Fowler? Well, that's a start. Come on, Olaf! Fowler, I can't see anymore! The whole wide world is spinning, Fowler! Jack! Jack! Jack! Yeah! Jack! What are you doing? Pass me the puck! You don't see that often! Find your focus. Find your focus. Okay. Fowler, I'm fine now. There you go. Well, here it is, Clark, the last game of the season before playoff time. Yes, siree. Coach Skinner has to be wondering what his team has to do to beat Jack and the Simians. I mean, Seattle's won all four games this season. Jack comes around the net, he shoots, scores! And the Simians take the one-nothing lead. I'm telling you, Bruce, Jack definitely has the Carjackers' number. Knox. Hmm. It's time to end this folly. No problem. You remember the plan? Yeah. Get the monkey into the net, and, uh... And then pull the net over you so the ref can't see what you're doing. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Let's go, Jack. Go get him! Come on! Yeah! Come on, Jack. Put it there. Go, Knoxy! Jack! Watch out! Jack! Jack! Yes! Jack! Ouch! What's going on? He bit me! The chimp bit me! The chimp bit my player! - What happened? - He bit me. Jack. If it wasn't for this glove, I would have lost my hand. Well, Miller, it seems that your little mascot has just bitten my player. What are you talking about? I want this animal thrown out of the game. You gotta be kidding. Ref? Number 99 and a half? You're out of the game. Oh! Come on, Knox. Let's make sure your hand's okay. Tell us what happened. I didn't actually see it. Jack. Jack, I think it's better if you wait in the dressing room. We'll be having a full inquiry into this investigation. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for coming. That monkey is an animal. He bit my player. What's he gonna do next? Take off a head? Huh? The ZHL should've never let a chimp play in the first place. What is the ZHL's policy? They should kick him out of the league. You wouldn't have anything to do with this, would you, Skinner? Are you accusing me? Are you accusing me of setting up a monkey? Are you crazy? - I'm reporting you! - I'm reporting you! Coach Miller, what are your thoughts on the Jack incident? I'm not gonna make any comment until there has been a proper enquiry. Oh, come on, Miller, stop dodging the question. Look, I've been assured by Commissioner Pasquela that the ZHL is gonna launch a proper and full investigation. But, I'll tell you this. If Jack did bite that player, the Simians will take all the appropriate actions. Where is Jack? Something smells fishy to me. Jack? Jack! - Jack? - Jack? Jack! Come on, Olaf. Hurry up. Go that way. Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! I don't know. You go that way. I'll go this way. All right. We'll find him. Jack! Hello, Ben, it's you. Important job today. You get to work for the cops! Hot off the presses! The cops are looking for him? He bit some hockey player. Is he dangerous? He's a hockey player! Go on, get them posters up! I'll cough up another $3 if you get them all posted by 5:00. Thanks, Mr. Raheja. We're not open yet! Um, excuse me. I'm with the Department of Child Services. I don't have any children. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a young boy. What did he do? He's a runaway. He ran away from a foster home. Unfortunately, his mother died a year ago. They tell me he loves to skateboard. Are you sure you haven't seen him? His name is Ben. What are you gonna do when you find him? Well, unfortunately, at his age, few children are adopted, so I'll have to find him another foster home. If I see him, I'll give you a call. Oh, thank you, Mister... Uh... Plant. Oliver Plant. Mr. Plant. I'll just leave you my card. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Dad! Hey, Suzanne. Careful! Oh, I'm starving. Thanks, Nick. Ketchup? Can I get a dog? All right. Hey, kid! Didn't you see the sign? I don't know what it means. No posters. Oh, I'm sorry. How come you're not in school? We just moved here from Alaska. I'm starting school next week. Alaska, huh? There's my mom now. Gotta go. Hey, hey! Wai... Oh, no! Jack's missing! Unfortunately, Julie, the police have no leads so far. But we were looking for Jack all day. We'll go back out after the game. Call me when you hear something. Yeah, I'm sure we'll find him soon. Okay. Okay! What do you think? Awesome. Yeah? You'll probably need a couple of these. I'll be closing up five minutes. Okay. So, you want this on your sponsor account? Yeah. Thanks, Ollie. Oh, no. Thank you! Good choice! That's my favorite. I'll give it to you for 50 bucks. Thanks. Can't afford it. Are you going? Huh? We'll be at the competition. Neil won last year. So, Neil, if you're not gonna be using this board, I'm just gonna throw it out back in the dumpster. All right. What the... What the... What the heck's goin' on? Jeez. I've got to find another alley. And he 5-0s the ramp, fakie rocks the spine, and ollies to flat. The crowd goes wild. Yeah! Night, Mom. Love you. So, do you want to try it? Come on! Right over here. Do it here. Nice and slow. You got it. You got it. Keep your balance. We'll have this roll-in done in no time. Perfect. We should get you your own skateboard. Shh. Don't worry. This isn't stealing. This is old stuff that they've thrown away. Just need one more wheel. Hello? I got it! Let's get out of here! How's this? This is you, isn't it? Looks like, you're wanted. You don't seem dangerous. I know what it's like to have people looking for you for no reason. I won't tell anyone. Come on, Jack! And there you go. Three-one the final score. Yupper dupper, Bruce. Oh, ladies and gentleman, unexpectedly, uh, Bud Fulton has joined us in the studio. - Bud? - Hello. It's been some time since Jack's gone missing, and we at the Seattle Simians would like nothing more than to see him returned home. If you have any information regarding the whereabouts of Jack, please contact the Simians immediately. We're never gonna find Jack this way. It's been days! We're not gonna give up until we find Jack. Okay, let's go this way. Hey! Hey, hang in there. Hey, guys. What, still? Has no one seen him? Not yet. Hopefully, someone will see one of the posters and call. We are done with our road trip now, so we'll start looking ourselves again. I understand. Call us when you hear something. Even if it's in the middle of the night. We'll keep you posted. He hasn't come back yet. It'll be okay. Louie?

This is the first step for some of the hottest young talent on the skateboarding scene, and we expect the competition this year to be fierce. The winner will receive $1,000 in prize money and a trip to the nationals to compete against the best boarders in the nation. Well, why don't you go up and sign in? Go. We just need to get your parent or guardian to sign this form if you want to enter the contest. Uh, they're not here. Sorry, bud. Is there a problem? Uh, are you his father? Uh, no. Why don't you take Jack and grab us some seats? Jack, these guys are good. This is a hard competition.

Jack can hardly skate now. Aw, forget it. You can have your monkey. We'll take the cup. Look, it's Jack! Okay, then, let's get this game underway. Thank you. Next up, Sammy Rogers. Now, Sammy is the only girl at this year's competition, and word has it she can ride with the best of them. Ollies over the roll-in. Very cool. Oh, she has some awesome moves! Stiff competition. Oh, yeah. Girl power is definitely alive and well at this year's competition. Sammy's sending out a message to the boys that she means business. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. They started already. Oh, come on, let's go. This way. Excuse us. Excuse us. Coming through. Next up is Neil Nellis. Now, Neil is our defending state champion, and he's looking to make it two in a row. He starts with a fakie hand and a fakie rock. Backside and over the channel. That boy likes to fly. ♪ Hey, I know ♪ That I can't talk to you right now ♪ Ooh, and he falls on the kick-flip over the channel. Now there's room for our final skater to make his move. Sorry, sorry.

Hey, Mike, can I get some duct tape over here? Whenever you're ready, Ben. Jack, what are you doing? I can't do this. Wait a minute. There's somebody else up there with him. I think it's a monkey.

What an amazing run by Ben Johnson. This crowd is going crazy with excitement. We did it, Jack. That was super slick. We did it, Jack! We've got less than 20 seconds left in the second period, and the game is all tied one to one. Here comes Bubalochov in on Naddy. Undresses Schikedanz. The clock's winding down now. He shoots, he scores! Oh, what a beautiful goal! Mad Dog Brady never had a chance. That ends the second period with the Carjackers leading two to one. I just can't understand why the Simians have not played Jack at all in the first two periods. You know, he looked pretty rusty during the warm-up. Maybe he's got to get his ice legs back. That's all right, Jack. You'll get it back. You're just a little out of practice. Yeah, you just lost 40 pounds. That's got to be hard on the body. Would you like a hot dog? Hot dogs are good for you. They're full of vitamins A, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium... And to announce this year's winner, please welcome skateboarding champion Bob Burnquist. Thank you, Mandy. Hello, everyone. Wow, we saw some great lines from some awesome skateboarders today. Third place is gonna go to Sammy Rogers. All right, Sammy. Congratulations. Thanks. Second place is gonna go to Neil Nellis. All right, Neil. Congrats. Now, choosing this year's winner was a tough decision but I think our judges did a great job, and our winner is... Ben Johnson. Come on up, Ben. Good job. Good job. Everyone, let's give it up for this year's winner, Ben Johnson! Ben! Ben! Good job, buddy. Ben! Ben! No, no, no. Wait. Ben, it's okay. I just want to talk to you. I don't want to go back. But now, Ben you know, I've been thinking. My place is pretty empty and I thought you might perhaps consider living with me. Do you mean it? You bet I do. All right! All right, listen, folks, I'm afraid I have to take this chimpanzee with me. Jack didn't do anything. Oh, I know that. He's got a hockey game to play. The Simians are down two to one. You mean you're not gonna lock him up? Lock him up? Are you kidding? Oh, this little guy's no criminal. Why, he's the best thing to happen to the ZHL since the Zamboni machine. Well, I guess you gotta go, Jack, but we'll catch up to you. Yeah, Jack, go on ahead. You're not gonna get rid of us that easily. Yo, Ben, good job on the ramp today, man. Tell you what, after seeing you skate today, I want to sponsor you. Whoa! Why don't you and I go for a victory session right now? Right now? Yeah, man, come on. It's always time to skate. Whoa! Come on. Ready, Jack? Come on, let's go. Straight ahead. There you go. I'll see you out there. Jack? Huh? Huh? Jack? What? Huh? What? This explains it. You're Jack? And you're Louie? You're brothers. Okay, men, we've got a "chimpionship" to win. Jack, put your gear on. All right, let's do it. Hey, great news. We found Jack. Oh, and Louie's here, too. Oh, great. I'm gonna go tell Lulu and all the others. They're gonna be thrilled. All right, here we go. The Simians are back on the ice. Well, it's been an incredible game so far. I'll tell you, LA is leading two to one. If the Simians want to have a chance at the cup, they've got to score early. That's right, Clark, even with Jack back. Fans are on their feet here in Seattle, urging on their Simians. Here's a shot for the point. Poirier passes the puck down to the net. Pass that puck to Jack. Jack shoots, scores! Yeah! We got a tie hockey game! Yes! Whoo! Watch out! Ahhh! Bubalochov's in on net. He shoots and scores! The Carjackers take back the lead. Come on, ref, I hardly touched the guy. Go for it, fella, go! Jack, I'm open. Let's go, man. Yeah! Yeah! Boy, what an exciting game we got going here tonight, Clark. With just over a minute to go in the third period, the score is tied three-three. And I'll tell you, folks, Jack has really pulled it together. Bubalochov, a shot, and it's saved by Brady. That could have been the game saver, Bruce. Boy, you could cut the tension with a knife in here, Clark. Only 20 seconds left on the clock. We're tied up at three. Looks like we'll be going into overtime. Go, go, go, go. Ho, ho, what a move! Go, Jack! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, Jack! Jack scored! Yeah, Jack! Yeah! Yeah, it's good! Yes! Seattle has won the cup! Ooh, I'm gonna get that little monkey. Not sorry. Yeah! Ha, ha, ha! All right, guys! Well, there it is. It's now official. Jack has been named the MVP for this year's ZHL cup final. Yeah! Jack! Jack! Jack! Here, Louie. I put this together so you can learn how to skate like Jack. Bye, Jack. I'll miss you. Goodbye, Jack. Take care, Jack. Rock on, Jack-o. Jack and Louie, don't forget friend. Bye, Jack. Come on, Ben. Let's go home. I'm gonna miss them furry little fellas.
