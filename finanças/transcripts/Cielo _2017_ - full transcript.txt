No one ever sees this part of an astronomer's life. People imagine that we show up and just look around and we're all famous. Everything is perfect and it all works out just fine. But sometimes you get here, and there's nothing but clouds and more clouds. I don't think it will clear up. It's depressing. And minutes go by but it doesn't clear. Should we switch on a light and do a calibration? So we can see a spectrum. I'm curious about this. I'm missing those two. No, they're there. See? Here and here. And those little ones in between. Those two? I think it's like this. I thought we'd lost the star for a second there! Those of us who are physicists have so much in our minds, we are overwhelmed by nature per se. We think about it all the time. Maybe you think about it all the time! I don't spend my whole life thinking about it. But it's striking. You don't even need the sky to understand how big nature is. How wise it is. How much information we fail to notice. An atom, everything is a universe in itself. Your work is to constantly be watching the sky. It must be extraordinary. I think that if you watch the sky... I mean, from the moment that you look at it with profundity and tranquility, you realize that the sky is there. My God, so many things are up there! I believe that this realization happens to everyone who really looks at the sky. It hits them the very first time they look at the sky. I can't fathom that a human being can look up and not be genuinely amazed. -Does this happen to you? -Yes. Does it happen every time you look at the sky? -I think so. -Or only when... Every time I look at the sky here, I don't know how to express it. The silence. The beauty. In Chile, it's like we can touch the sky. And the stars... I´m inspired by these mountains to take care of the earth. They remind me of images I have seen of Mars, which is all desert. They say that there could have been life there, but there's no life now. For an astronomer, I am very earth-centred. I like physics, but I am not a spiritual person. I don't look at the stars and have profound thoughts. I look at the stars and I always think about the earth. Look, we have wars. People are hungry. People are homeless. People can't find work to support their families. And look how insignificant we are. We are absolutely nothing. We are so tiny in the immensity of the universe. Why do we have to live like this? Instead of living in harmony and helping each other. Trying to further the progress of humanity in a positive way, to make things better. Not just to kill each other. I always think of this amusing analogy. Human beings are the equivalent of ants living in an ant's nest. The ants go to find food to bring back to the nest. And when an ant comes up and looks around, I wonder what is it thinking? I mean, I don't believe an ant thinks, but what does an ant see? For us, as observers of the universe, it's kind of the same. We are ants looking through a telescope. But is the universe really what we happen to see? Or is it just what we are capable of seeing? An ant could never fathom that it lives on a planet that is round, or that has mountains, etcetera. And we are kind of the same. Like the ants, we look and see what we can see, but we can't grasp the immensity of the universe. When I speak with people who have an explanation for everything, and who think they know everything, I just think that's an impossibility. Because we aren't looking down from above, we are looking upward from below. Hey you, don´t be so nosy! Nosy little buggers! Go outside! Out! This one is so stubborn. Right, you´re pouring some gasoline over it. You know what? Let's add those plastic bags. Now I want the shiny knife. You should cut it in half. Not destroy it. I´ve already destroyed it. I'm taking it out on the chicken. I have to take it out on something! How is the wine? Is it off? No, it tastes... It´s not bad. Not bad at all. The factory makes crappy wine. Sure, it´s not a bottle of San Pedro. It's fine for making vinegar! No use to you because it´s a bit sweet, right? Yes, a bit sweet. -You find it sweet? -A bit sweet and acidic. What do the people see in the sky here? You can see shooting stars around here. You see them sneaking in and then they disappear. I don't know, maybe they fall into the sea. People call them shooting stars. You see them a lot. Mostly in the summer, because the sky is clear, so you can see them falling. In Mexico, where you are from... From Canada. In your country, you look at the sky, don't you? But I live in the city. With all the lights and buildings, you can't see anything. Of course, you don't appreciate it. If there are too many lights, you don't see anything. The sky is hidden. We spend so much time looking down. When I arrived in this desert and watched the sky, it was as if I was seeing it for the first time. I had never seen a sky so alive, so profound. It seems as if we watch the sky less and less. Is it the same here? I remember in the old days, my grandparents, who have since passed away, they loved looking up at the night sky. Every single night they'd go outside, sit on their bench and watch the sky. That was in the countryside. They have been dead for ages. But they loved watching what was happening in the night sky. The elders gave names to all of the stars. The Three Marías, the Bright Star. We have names for almost all the stars. One night in the desert, I lay on the ground watching the stars. I felt like... I felt like it was moving. Have you ever felt that? You mean how it moves? Yes, that´s right. I think the earth moves. I don't believe the sky is moving. No. I'm telling you, the Earth has two movements, rotation and revolution. Revolution follows the line of the equator, and rotation is around the magnetic poles. It has to turn and move that way, or else we would fall. No sweetie! You're just like Columbus who believed that the earth was flat. But there must be some way that we hold ourselves upright in the night. If not, we'd fall off. No, you don't understand! Right now, it's daytime for us, and in the part below, it's nighttime. And when night falls here, it's day in the other part and night here for us. Right now, we are belly up! We are upside down, the others are not. But then how do we hold ourselves upright? It's because of the... What is it called? Gravity! That's why there's gravity! The way I feel... I arrived here when I was very young. Once every two or three months, we travelled to Vallenar to buy supplies. We just went for a short time and came back. And I thought... When night fell, the cars turned on their headlights. But I didn't know what headlights were! I thought that the stars had come down. I think it must be the same for someone who's used to city lights and who sees natural light, like a star. It must seem different to them, and strange at the same time. There's something amazing about the desert here. It's as though everything is alive, right? Yes, I've had experiences, when I was young and even now, working at night. There are apparitions. I've seen people who don't actually exist. But something more intimate happened when I was young. A young girl appeared out of nowhere. She accompanied me until I was older. And then I didn't see her again. We did not speak, we just gestured. When I was feeling bad, I would feel better when she was around. But we never communicated like you and I are doing right now. Was it like a spirit? Yes, but more than a spirit, an angel I believe. An angel from the sky? That would be beautiful. The sky will never stop being beautiful. At least the sky here is different than in other places, even though it is the same. I am afraid of not being able to see the sky one day. And I wonder, are there beings out there like us, or who think like us? I have always believed that we aren't the only ones. When I was a child, I would go out with my flashlight and shine it upwards to see if they would respond. What would happen if someone replied? What would we do? Maybe we would run away. The sky is always interesting. Always. -What is that? -A UFO. I see four. I'm not sure how the lights are divided. Sometimes they spin. They spin like propellers, but slowly. I can't tell what this might be. It looks like a red spot. I don't know if it's a UFO or what. There are two small objects. Can't make out what it is. There are two of them. There are beings and spirits. I'll tell you how it happened. Once I was with Negro Fernando and Ricardo and another guy. There was something big and tall in that area and it stopped there. We all said, "Look at that!" All of a sudden, it disappeared. -Was it spinning? -No, it was still. It's like at night, when you can see lights and flashes. It shined beautifully and all of us stayed there watching it for quite a while. Then it disappeared. And Negro said, "What was that?" Some people say they exist, but do you believe... -In Martians? -Yes. They say that extraterrestrials live up there on other planets, and they can come down, fall in love and have a child. And the children would be demigods. And these planets are superior to ours? I believe that we're more evil than them. That's probably why they don't show up, because they know we're evil. I slept so well! Let's light the campfire, okay? Did it go out? I was sleeping. The scientists, they say we are the dust of stars And their offspring treading in their footsteps Yet I've only seen dust deep beneath the ground Toiling in the mine in air heavy like stone Sometimes I want to go above to stare at my wide-eyed star She shines from far away over the desolate land My search for gold is fruitless I search but I get no answer But I think there's a true-hearted star Singing to me in the sky That pretty pale blue light no one can hide An impossible dream shaped by time into a star She shines brighter than gold and remains sleepless by my side I want you always near Star of mine, Isabela This music feels right for that planet. What's the name of your planet? The planet is not mine. A Swiss group discovered it. It's called WASP 4. But we have our own name for it. We call it the Golem. What are sunsets like there? Apparently, considering the clouds that we see now, sunrise and sunset on this planet must be white. If you were on that planet, you would not notice a change. Maybe you wouldn't even know if it was day or night. Let's go to WASP 50. We are watching the star all the time. What will happen is a planet will cross in front of it. So the brightness of the star, which should be fairly constant, will suddenly diminish. We will see an eclipse now, when the planet eclipses its star. So this decrease in light will bring us all the information about the planet's atmosphere. And the light of the star, how does it travel all the way to us? Each ray of light is created in the centre of the star. This is very chaotic. Protons colliding with protons, generating new elements. From all this chaos, a ray of light escapes. Now, that ray of light leaving the centre of the star takes millions or hundreds of thousands of years to exit the star, and then reaches the atmosphere. It must be crazy, with storms circling around. It goes through the planet's atmosphere, it leaves, and easily travels for hundreds of years through space, until it meets this pale blue dot that is the Earth. The light continues to travel until it reaches the telescope. It goes inside, bouncing around the entire optical system. That light is transformed into current. That's what goes into the computer. It's what we analyze. I find it magical. We observe the light as it arrives and passes through the telescope. We analyze it right away. We see the eclipse right away. It's incredible. In my imagination, I can see the eclipse directly. I imagine exactly what is happening, or rather, what happened in this case. It must be hundreds or thousands of light-years away, so all of this happened hundreds or thousands of years ago. But we are seeing it now. We are seeing this information reach us in real time, as the planet passes in front of the star. I think I'm flying among the stars. Because I see a beautiful moon. It seems as though the earth is far away. In those days, animals could speak. Fox was walking over the hill. And Fox met Condor, who was carrying his guitar. Condor said to Fox, "We are invited to a party in the sky." "Let's go!" And Fox says, "How can I get there if I can't fly?" So Condor says, "You can get on here." Condor, the guitar player, slung the instrument over his chest. And Fox went on Condor's back, until they arrived in the sky. When they arrived, they saw some guests, and the party seemed just so-so. They were the main artists, because everyone in the Universe knew that Condor played the guitar beautifully and that Fox danced very well, especially when he wore his silver spurs. So the party kicked off in the sky, and the next day, the hosts said, "We have to pay Fox "because Fox made everyone happy, everyone danced all night." So they started bringing small bags full of seeds. And the seeds that Fox carried heavily on his back were hurled to the four corners of the earth. That's how all the trees, herbs and shrubs that we see nowadays came to be. I remember my grandmother was tall and skinny. She used to wear thin skirts that stuck to her body. I was the only grandchild, the only child in the valley! I was the only one! She said to me, when people look at the sky and see what we call shooting stars, they should spit three times. If not, the star will steal your memory. That is what my grandmother said. The star will steal your memory. I don't know what a star has to do with your memory. Also in the sky is what we call, what people today call the Magellanic clouds, those patches of cloud in the night sky. The old people called them guanaco's mudholes. The guanacos in the mountains around here, they have specific places they go to roll around. They give themselves a dust bath. They wallow around, covering their bodies in dust. They say that what we see in the sky from Earth are the mudholes of guanacos. Did your grandmother talk about the Milky Way? I heard that the ancestors saw animals in the dark patches of the sky. Llamas, birds and foxes. What we call the Milky Way is a river. There must be something to it, since she would always say that it's a river. When someone died, we had to kill a dog for them. This dog would help its owner swim across the river in the sky. So people would kill the dead person's favourite dog and the dog would join his master so they could cross the river, on their way to the sky. The ancestors were keen observers. They made astronomical observations. It's been said that the Southern Cross or Chakana was a very important symbol for ancient native cultures. That's why we can see it in rock art and petroglyphs. In the Southern Cross, you see the duality between man and woman, winter and summer, day and night. Life and death. Man is pure dust Among so many tracks Needn´t go to the sky To reach the stars The constellation that I like and that always brings back memories is the constellation they call Orion, where the Three Marías are. It always makes me think of my daughter, who died. Before she died, she used to say, "That star is me." "I am that star." I always remember this. The sky is like... How can I say it? It's like family. It's like seeing your brother, your cousins there. There's my mother, my daughter, my cousins. And they are visiting me. They are watching me from up there. My daughter is up there, she's watching me from her star. And others as well, they are watching us. One metre of surplus! One metre extra below! COCKTAIL OK -Okay, cheers! -Cheers! -Yes, we had first light. -Out of focus, however. He was happy because the camera was working. Everyone have a seat. Just a moment, please. I'd like to make a toast. As scientists, you know that there are always questions. One question leads to another. There's an infinity of questions. It won't surprise you that tonight, I have yet another question. What is your true connection with the sky? One at a time! First things first. To the sky! Which nourishes us and quenches our thirst. That's the wisdom of the earth. -He didn't get it. -What does that mean? -That the sky nourishes us? -Yes. Well... So you're an exoplanet hunter? But what does that really mean? It's like science fiction. And why do you chase planets? Why does this matter to us? Planet hunting resonates with the public because it raises fundamental questions about our origins, about why we are here. And these questions are connected to our habitat, our earth, but also to the existence of other similar worlds elsewhere and maybe of life elsewhere. So when we explain to people that we are looking for planets and for life elsewhere, obviously it resonates profoundly. These are age-old questions that everyone has wondered about at some point or another. And often, we think about them when we look up at the sky. And that's how it's connected to our understanding of the sky. We feel renewed because when we watch the sky, we forget everything we've learned. We see the immensity in front of us, and not just in terms of distance. Of course, people have trouble understanding such huge distances. But there's also an immensity of possibilities. In the sky, our imagination takes flight and everything is possible. Everything that opens our minds is important and is a catalyst for our growth. Historically, the sky is the first level. And then understanding the sky, and what's behind the sky, that's the second level. For me, that's what astrophysics is. It's the scientific explanation for the wanderings of our imagination beyond the screen of the sky. If we want to go to a planet that we discover, which might be a hundred light years away, it will take us 10,000 years to get there. 10,000 years to get there. So we either put people to sleep and wake them when they arrive, and here we're starting to get into science fiction, which I've always loved, and I still love. Or else we create something like Noah's ark. We send out families and a future generation will arrive. Subtitles T&S COOP (Copyright) 2017
