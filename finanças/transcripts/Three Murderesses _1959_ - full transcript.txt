THE WOMEN ARE WEAK I will not forget of your wedding! The hottest wedding! -Do you care for more? - No, thank you. May I pass? May I pass? - Here I am! - Finally! I'm so sorry! Someone is ringing the bell. - Mother! - What? Someone is ringing the bell. - My daddy is sexy, isn't he? - Very sexy! Maybe I am, but I'm too tired! - What's up, dear? No, no, nothing. You are in a very good shape! Julien, you shouldn't have come here. Especially on this day! I speak as her mother. As her older sister! Julien! What a beautiful surprise! I didn't know that you were invited. I wasn't invited. - That's why it's interesting! - You are the same! Are you crazy? Why did you invite him? - I didn't invite him! How dared him to come here! Let me, my friend! If I had a gun, I would kill you! Do not exaggerate, mother! It will not do any good! What are we going to do? What did you tell him? Nothing! I do not want to talk to him. I'm going to say hello to Agathe. Where is she? Why are you hiding in the kitchen? Are you afraid of me? I'm not so scary. You don't want even to greet me? Hello! I can not shake your hand, they are wet. It's been a while since the last time we met. Six months. How time flies! The last time we met we were in the tower of Notre Dame. The next day you had to go in the army. And the farewell, remember? We were very sad. Two weeks later, discovered by a friend that you were still in Paris. Yes, I obtained the postpone because of the studies. But at the end of the year I will have to go. Excellent! The Army will do you good. I often thought to write for you... but I didn't have the courage. At last, today I decided to come. I wanted to know how you were. Do you see? I got married today. Yes, I heard. See you in a wedding dress... - It makes me very unhappy - Now it's your turn. I was very unhappy, too. For a long time! For too long! And now, everything is finished between us? You don't like me anymore? I love another. I love my husband, who is a wonderful man! No doubt, you always had a good taste. Really? Agathe! You're neglecting your guests,have you forgot? Yes, Mom, you're right. After you, mother-in-law. Do not call me that! I'm not your mother-in-law. But you could have been! And I will regret it all my life. That one is your husband? In this bottle it has remained only a little! - Yes. - But Agathe, You married an old man! He is 32 years old. I admit that it is well preserved. Stupid! - What? - Nothing! Agathe, will you introduce your friend? Julien, this is my husband. Nice to meet you. We talk a lot about you. - I am a great admirer. - Andre loves tennis. He saw you when you won the finals at the university. He thinks you a great player. I'm embarrassed. No, you are an international-level player. I am confident that you'll become a world champion. I love tennis, but I will not become a pro. Really! I am very interested in electronics, and I'm writing a thesis. Julien is a very serious young man. At least in some things. Your career, for example. But not with the girls. Is not that right, Julien? Agathe! No problem, you know, Me and Agathe like to joke. - I can't wait to play tennis. - Yes? - I played well. I don't doubt about it. How can you suffer for that boy! I don't understand you. What do you mean? I know that he made you suffer so much, but if after all his time he keeps affecting you so much, it is sad, my poor friend. How did you know it was him? I am very smart! And you told me so much about him. Come on. What was I saying? What do you think of him? I don't notice anything extraordinary about him. I agree with you. Now, explain to me why this boy is so attractive? I'll tell you after he will court me. Will I make you gelous if I try to accost him ? No, you may do it. Now, I do not care. What happened to you? If he is looking at me, then it was not in vain. I'd be scared if I were you. Why? I told you that he is a womanizer. That he make crazy all the girls. And you can't wait to fall into his arms! Do not worry about me. I know how to take care of myself. Look! I think he's coming here. Do you want me to leave you? Yes, I don't want to perfor my act in your presence. Okay, good luck! It seems we know each other. You're not original at all . Did you say something, miss? - No, nothing, I thought.. Well then, excuse me. I guarantee that we know each other! Do you live in Paris? No, in Bordeaux. I am Pierre's cousin, Adrianna's brother, Andre's sister, who is Agathe's husband. I came to the wedding. Maybe you saw me in Bordeaux. I have never been to Bordeaux. However, watching you closely, You don't look like the girl I thought I knew. - Excuse me, please. Not at all. - What a mistake, right? - Yes. Serve you right! - Does it happen often? - Often. - You must be laughing at me! No, never. Don't tell me you liked her. She seemed so stupid! It was you who interested me. But didn't dared to accost you. You make me nervous. - Oh really? Agathe told me everything about you. And now, probably, I am against you. I was completely in love with Agathe. I'm still in love with her. Really?You surprise me! I'd like to surprise you! Why? I would like to be liked by you. But you make me a little shy. You seem so sure of yourself. And you are not shy? - Not at all. In this moment I am very sad. Do you want me to comfort you? I should like it. Let's dance. - What? - I do not know how to dance. - Not at all? - Not at all. - You could have said it before! I wanted to hold you in my arms. - Not even a "cha-cha"? - Not even. A Don Juan who doesn't know how to dance is an odd thing... But I walk a lot. I can walk for hours. - Do not want to take a walk? - Here? No, on the street. I was expecting this. And why not? Very well. I hope you don't say goodbye to all the guests. - Hello Julien! How are you doing? - Great. Don't stay too long, or I will be kidnapped. Relax, I'll be back in a minute. I'm going for a walk. Julien will accompany me home. How long will you stay at Venice? Three weeks. Don't forget to send me some postcards! Of course. - Bye! We are going! One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. -1, 2, 3 - 1, 2, 3 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. My foot aches me. I will refresh them in the fountain. Do you usually think about death? Very often. Do you want to die of old age? Yes. You do not? I wouldn't mind. I should live 100 years. - How horrible! - Why? I will be in great form, science is making progress ! How old were your grandparents when they died ? Why do you ask? To know how much you will live. Just add their ages, when they died. And then, divide by 4, and will have the approximate age you will live. - Do not be silly. - It is scientific proved. It was the doctors who discovered it. But if you had a grandparent which was murdered when he was 22, then he doesn't count. The accidental deaths don't count. - Of course. Wait... My grandmother is still alive. Mine too. Now, simply divide by 3. Do you already know yours? Yes. I can live to be 62, is not so bad. I'm so sorry for you. Let me see. My grandfather on the part of father died aged, 83 years old. Great!Plus 60. - 143. PLus 34. Yes, but then the penicillin still wasn't invented! 177 divided by 3, equal to 59. 59 years... Ow! It's not so much! How old are you now? 19. You still have 40 years left. We have no time to lose. Can we meet tomorrow? So we'll see each other tomorrow? - All right. At 5 o'clock in Sorbonne coffee. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. It didn't go right, did it? I am a sentimental one, I wouldn't have make you wait... Maybe it's not his fault, maybe he had an accident. Maybe was hit by a car? Good one! Sabine! Excuse me. Sabine! Forgive me for the other day. I couldn't warn you. Don't apologize. It's not important. But for me, is very important. I received a call from a friend, he had big problems. Why do you lie? I know you went to a party! What bastard told you that? Sabine, do not be angry, let's set another day. No! Don't you ever think about! Sabine, I'm so sorry! I thought of you ever since. Give me one more chance. - No! No, you're wasting your time. Let's see Sunday afternoon! I am free all day! - But I'm not! - Sabine! At six o'clock I will be free! At 6, at the Sorbonne, this time I will come, I promise! Until Sunday! Hello, sister. - Hello, sister! - My dear girl! I'm so glad to see you here! - I came to accompany H?l?ne Maroni. - We already know. Yes, Helene's mother warned us. But in general, on Sundays we allowed only the parents. But the parents are traveling! Why can't she see me? Okay,this time we make an exception. Sister Veronique! Tell H?l?ne that her friend Sabine is here. Always the same smell. Yes. I'm sure you miss your college. Not at all. If I shall have sons, I assure you that they will not go in college. But that does not include you, sister, you've always been nice. - But already some... - Sabine. The university environment that you attend, seems to have bad influences on you. Are you going regularly to Mass? Yes, every Sunday. - That's great. This is our H?l?ne! You run down the stairs. It's great to see you here! Shall we go? Do not forget, that H?l?ne should return at 6 in the afternoon, for attending services in the chapel. Of course, sister, I'll be back at 6, I promise. Put your hat on. I hope you won't take her to the movies. I trust you. Okay, I promise. Goodbye, sister. Have fun, my daughters. Two chocolates, 3 sweets, 300 grams of chocolate with nuts. I spoil you, poor one. Not at all. Well, now listen. This stupid Jacqueline, told all about sister Bernadette. - Do you believe? - Yes... Are you interested in hearing what I say? No, is interesting! What is the matter with you, Sabine? You're strange. It's ten minutes to 6. I don't care. I'll tell the sisters I missed the train. I'm thinking about my date. You said you didn't like that guy, and that you will not go. In fact I didn't want to go. But I wanted to know if he has. Why? Usually he doesn't come? - Waiter, another Coca-Cola. - Allright Sir. He is there! Well, if you have seen him, can we go? H?l?ne, would you return alone? - No, not at all. Do you have the money for the train? Yes, I have, do not worry. Well, have fun. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello! - Hello! Forgive me. I went to the movies with a friend, I forgot what time it was. Is he so handsome? Well, if I forgot your date, he should have been so. A grenadine, please. - At once. Imagine a mix of Marlon Brando and G?rard Philipe in one person. With the voice of Pierre Fresnay. I am very honored that you left a guy like this in exchange for my poor person. Sabine! Sabine, you forgot to give me my chocolates. These are yours? Sorry, but I already ate almost half. No problem. Would you like to drink with us? No, she does not have time, she has to get the train to college. Where is your college? In Versailles. Sisters of the Visits Sisters of the Visits? Sounds good. Goodbye, sir. And thanks for the ride, I loved it. Goodbye. Is she a mixture of Brando and G?rard Philipe? Stop it! Will you be in a bad mood because of this? This story annoyed me a little. I am very jealous, I warn you. What else are your faults? Tell them all to me.You will save time. Come on. - In general or detailed? - Only in general terms. I also lie, but only with women. - Womanizer? Womanizer, of course. - Sentimental? Terribly selfish. When you will fall in love with me, you will get rid of all your flaws. The thing you need is a great love. I foresee that you will make me suffer. This will do you a lot of good. Maybe we can start at once. After meals it begins a pain here, as if it something press me with a finger. Did you consult a doctor? No, I prefere to use at once a medicine. Something like... magnesium. Magnesium? Great. Hello Sabine. Agathe's in your room. - Here. You think this will help? This will not damage. You aren't so enthusiastic. - Lady? - I wish something to lose weight. - Hello! - How sweet of you to come! Well, how was your honeymoon? It was not bad. A little like the balls. You command the fun. - Is your husband at home? Yes, he's getting dressed. - Do you need help with your bags? No, don't touch anything. There is not enough room to put so much clothes on. It would be nice if we could buy an apartment. My parents agreed that we use this... But they do not want to move away because of the pharmacy. Well, it'a a little narrow in one room. But we have our bathroom. Sorry, do you want a cup of tea? No, thank you. - Are you sure? - Assurance. Here Mother, put that away, too. It's terrible that my parents are stupid! Agathe! Where is my green shirt? - Scuse me! Hello, Sabine! - Hello Andrew. Agathe! Quickly! I'm so late! Yes. Hello, Hello! Here. I said the green one! Use the white! What's the difference? He spend all morning wandering in pajamas, and then I must looking for his the clothes I can't stand it! Never marry, Sabina! Goodbye, my dear! See you tonight! Bye, Sabine! - Goodbye, mother. Good-bye, Andr?. Well... And how are you? You look happy. Have you seen Julien? Yes, we're flirting. I could have sworn. When I saw you two at the wedding, I immediately knew that you would be his next victim. Victim? Me? Then you do not know me! I tamed "Don Giovanni". Soon he will be eating from my hands. Congratulations. You have made the impossible. After all, it is not easy. Are you nervous because he is in love with me? Why should I? I am a married woman. Men don't interest me anymore. Besides my husband, of course. Sister Marie, call H?l?ne Maroni. H?l?ne Maroni! H?l?ne Maroni! I want you to know, sir, that I make an exception authorizing this visit. H?l?ne, embrace your cousin. - Hello, H?l?ne. How are you doing? - Great. Mister, I'll leave you with your cousin. Sister Marguerite will oversee your conversation. The rules must be obeyed. - Thank you very much. - H?l?ne! Tell your cousin to sit down. You must say: Sit down, Julien. Sit down, Julien. I'll leave the door open. It's a beautiful sunshine - How is Sabine? - Great. Does she know that you... are here? No, I wanted to know the "sisters of visitation". I thought my unexpected visit would please you. And I remembered also that you liked chocolate. H?l?ne, offer your cousin a lottery ticket . In one month we will have a big charity lottery. The prizes are great. A stove, a beautiful lamp, fur coat, an electric iron... We've sold almost all raffles. Only two cards have left. A ticket costs 20 francs. But if you buy a set of tickets, that costs 200 francs, You will surely win a prize. Okay, I'll buy a set. You are right! It's a great draw! Prizes will be drawn on New Year's Eve. You can come with H?l?ne's parents. I think they will be in Paris for the New Year. The visit is over. You must leave! H?l?ne, I'm so glad to see you! Now you can join your colleagues H?l?ne. - Goodbye. -Goodbye, mister! - If he isn't your cousin you cand tell us who is he? Tell us! - Do you want to know? - Yes! He is my fianc?. - Do you have a fianc?? - Yes. I will get married soon, when Julien finishes his studies. Is his name Julien? So you're his mistress? Of course, because I'm in love. H?l?ne Maroni! I'll wait for you in my office! The apple. Who are you calling? Are you jealous? Remember H?l?ne? H?l?ne? No, I don't remember her. How come? The one who studies in a college of nuns. Remember the brunette who returned to take the chocolates? The student? I remember her well. What happened to her? I do not know, her mother told me to call her. But you... Hello? Hello? Hello? I would like to speak with Mrs. Maroni, please. I don't know if I may bother Mrs Maroni they just got back from a travel. - They are rehearsing. We're not here! We're not here! I hate those phones! I don't want it at home! How can I rehearse in such circumstances! Let's start again. 3, 4. Sorry, but I didn't undestand your name. Sabine? I'll call her. Do not be nervous, ?douard,it's for me. I'll come in a moment. Continue without me. Hello? Hello, ma'am. I received your letter. Have you ever read it? Very good. The sister of the school called me this morning, H?l?ne was expelled from the college. It's impossible.Why, what reason? A scandalous reason! Can't say more on the phone, but... It is very serious. Will you stop chatting on the phone? - I'll come! My husband does not know yet. You know him, he is a violent man... He could kill her. Think of something. I'm coming! - Who was it? - H?l?ne's friend. H?l?ne is in high school! Why does she call her here? I'm going to take away this phone! ?douard! I have something to tell you about H?l?ne. Is she ill? - No. You will tell me another time, now I am busy! - What are you doing? - Silencing the phone. I don't want to be disturbed anymore by those calls! Now what is that? It's the bell, don't be angry. - Mrs. Maroni, please. All right, ma'am. ?douard, we need to talk. Is a very serious matter. - Yes, what is it? H?l?ne was expelled from the college. Why was she expelled? Well... She laughed during Mass. Laughing at Mass? What do you mean? I also did it, when I was young! Shut up! The nun is at the door. Serious? I'll tell her what I think about it! It's absurd to expell a girl for a thing like that! - It's stupid! No, I will go. Stay here. Don't ever think about it. Hello, Mom, I'm glad to see you. Go to your room, I will come soon. You must understand, dear lady, we can not have in our institution a student who had... How can I say... a relationship with a man. But it is impossible, H?l?ne did't know any boy! It's not so, mrs. She knew at least this young man who has come without shame to visit your daughter. But why did you authorize him? He said that was her cousin. I do not believe it! I put her in a Catholic school, and it happened a thing like this. Madame! The evil has been done when he met H?l?ne. At school the conversation lasted 5 minutes, and under supervision. Your daughter admitted that she was dating him a long time ago. And... And that she wasn't anymore... What a mess. That must have happened on vacation... We went to Brazil... ? H?l?ne was alone in Paris. Don 't worry, Marguerite, all this does not matter. Sister, you must know that I agree with my daughter. What are you saying? Well, you can not kick her out because of such nonsense! Do not intrude, please! Well, children have a right to have fun! It's not a crime! Everyone of us did it at that age, isn't it, sister? Did you ever laugh when you were young? But not that way! Yes, I agree that the church isn't the right place, but... Sorry sister, for my husband. He's a little nervous. I noticed. I better go. Let's pray for her. After all, it's all we can do. It's okay. Bye. Goodbye, Miss! You were very unpolite! - I don't understand you! H?l?ne just laughed at Mass, we won't make a tragedy of it! Let's rehearse, already we lost a lot of time. - Hello! - Hello! You was kicked out of school? Are you happy, aren't you? I could have thought more with my head. After all, you're not a lover's type. Or you are hypocrit, and you've hidden your datings very well. If you had something to tell me, you didn't do it. Is it true? You have a lover? Of course, is true. What is his name? Don't bother to ask me. I will not speak. - Do I know him? No, dear, you are wrong. He is always traveling, is rarely here in Paris. Is it beautiful? Terrific! Here. Julien! Agathe! What a surprise! I was passing, I saw your motorcycle, and I waited for you. - Am I bothering you? - No! No, but I didn't know that you have already returned from traveling. How? Sabine didn't tell you that she saw me? No, she didn't say anything. We talked a lot about you. It seems you're in love with her. I must tell you that it affected me. - Really? - Yes. Do you want to drink something? Yes, perhaps. Come on. Marguerite! I am not here for nobody, I want to be leaved alone! Sabine! Good afternoon, ma'am! I want to present you Julien Fenal. She is Elena's mother. Hello, sir. I've heard a lot about you, from Sabine and from the papers. You are a great artist. You are too kind. We're going in the pool. I thought H?l?ne could come with us. I'm afraid to let her go... After what happened. Do not worry, ma'am. We will not abandon her. Okay, I'll call her. It'll be good to get some air. Marguerite! Scuse me. - Marguerite! You let our daughter with a young man! I was not born yesterday! It starts with the pool and then she will have an unwanted husband! That's ridiculous, Edouard. He's Sabine's fianc?. He seems a nice guy. Anyway, you could have been more interested in your daughter's education, you are interested only in your career You read a bad article in Le Figaro and now you are in a bad mood! I am a person who does not care about criticism. You know that! Be nice to H?l?ne. - I count on you. - I promise you. Hello, H?l?ne! Do you remember my friend Julien? - Hello, miss. - Hello sir. Goodbye, young people. Have fun! Goodbye, mother! - Goodbye, ma'am. Goodbye, madam. Don't worry about H?l?ne. This swimsuit is horrible. It's difficult to find a better one. I just left school. I did not have time to buy another. Do not worry about it.It doesn't matter. How are you? Your wife is well? Excellent! Yes, you'll see her, she's here with me. There she is. Agathe! Look here! Look at me! Yes! Hello, Julien! Idiot! You wet my hair! - Are you happy to see your Agathe? - Not a bit! - You still haven't seen her? - No. Didn't your heart beat a little faster? Not a bit. - Aren't you going to swim? Come on, she'll be happy. This swimsuit looks great on you! H?l?ne! Come here! Lie down. Let's make a sunbath. - Are you crazy? - I love you! If you want to flirt with me, you must separate from Sabine. She thinks you're crazy about her. She keeps repeating it all day! Well, you know how Sabine is. She is a mythomaniac I go for a swim. - No, no, please. Please. - No, no. - It's all right. Your husband dives well. Julien is also a great diver. Why are you running away from me? No, I'm not running away. Oh, yes, you are, and that makes me sad. - You're very unfriendly. - No! I assure you! It happened an extraordinary thing. When I first saw you in the cafe, I instantly fell in love with you. I return in good shape! You have to come here more often! I wanted a more quiet place for my declaration. When I'm with you I don't know what I'm doing. I speak a lot about you. With Sabine? - No, with my mother. I love my mother very much, I told her everything. I was very unhappy. I was thinking of you all the time. I was thinking of you, too. It's incredible what is happening, isn't it? Look! It's noon, we must dress! - Are you already going? Yes, Agathe's parents wait for us at dinner. I am ashamed of Sabine. Don't be, nothing happened. Haven't you been a little in love with her? Not at all. Maybe Sabine is, but I assure you that I don't make anything that could make her think so. - Do you believe me? - Yes I believe you. Are not you ashamed? Standing here alone. I think your friend Sabine deceive herself about that guy. - What do you mean? I saw her kissing Helene. - It is not possible! I saw them with my own eyes. And they seemed to enjoy it. Sabine! Sabine! Come and see me tomorrow. I have something important to tell you! Okay, see you tomorrow! Maybe it's better not to tell her. Independent, this guy is a bastard! Poor Sabine... I should not have told you. You did the right thing. Hello Sabine. I need to talk to you. Sorry for the mess. - What is it? - I'm very worried. My daughter has a lover. - A lover? - You know him... Probably you saw him at the wedding. His name is Julien Fenal. What do you mean? Yes! My daughter is crazy about him. She can't ever forget him. All this will end badly. She can not see him again! I'm going to talk to her, Madam. - Hello! - I heard some news! - Julien is your lover! - Shut up! My husband is in the next room. You could have thought of this before! If you know how sorry I am... - I should not have agreed. You didn't have to behave that way! You knew that Julien loved me! And you burned of jealousy! I saw your tricks in the pool. Yes? But you know what he was doing while we were sunbathing? He was courting H?l?ne! He even kissed her! - I do not believe you! My husband saw them! I can't trust anyone! H?l?ne my best friend! I girl I trusted so much! H?l?ne has nothing to do with this! Who knows what Julien told her! - What are you doing? I want to know the truth. It's not possible that H?l?ne betrayed me so! Hello! I want to speak with H?l?ne. It's Sabine. Hello,miss. - Hello, sir. - I'll call her. H?l?ne! - H?l?ne! H?l?ne is not here. - Where is she? - I don't know. I think she went to a walk. - She needed some fresh air. - H?l?ne is not at home, miss. She went for a walk. In my time, mothers knew where their daughters were. Now, it seems this custom isn't used anymore. Goodbye. - And then? H?l?ne isn't at home. Must be with him. This time it didn't work well? - Are you waiting for Julien? - Yes I am. He called that he is sick and he won't be able to come. Thank you. He is sick, but I am healthy... Are you happy to see your little Anita? Is it so, my little one? Yes. - Well, say you're happy! Yes, I am very happy. Julien is delighted to have you here! Mother, don't tell her so, she might take advantage. Madame, please. Yes? Scuse me. - Are you happy? - Yes, a lot. We will be together for always, isn't it wonderful? - Yes, miss. - Hello. Sorry for the inconvenience. I've come to see if Julien is any better. Yes, he is much better. I brought him some raisins and some books. Well, I'll give them to him- He'll be happy for sure. Have Julien told you about me? I am H?l?ne. No, he didn't ever tell me about you. He didn't ever tell you about me? Miss, I'm afraid you deceived yourself about my son's feelings. He should have said that he has a fiancee. A fiancee? Yes. His fiancee was in South America, but now she is back and... They will get married in a month. It's terrible. My son is very charming. You can't resist him. He doesn't understand the sufferings he creates. Do you want me to tell him you came? No, please, don't tell him! Goodbye! - Hello. - Listen carefully! We aren't friends anymore! You betrayed our friendship, I will never forgive you! What is she saying? I can not hear. Only a few noises. Give it to me, I speak to her! Hello? H?l?ne? It's Agathe. Listen to me, I know you're not to blame for what happened. This bastard deceived the three of us! Give it back to me! I went to visit his mother, if you knew what I discovered! What? Betrothed? I need to make a call . - He is betrothed. - It's not possible! Excuse me, but I need to make a call. Leave me alone, Andr?! Can't you see we're busy? What is she saying? Wait a minute. I'm going to turn off the gas. She went to turn off the gas. Gas ?! She wanted to commit suicide? H?l?ne! H?l?ne! - Hello? I'm coming to you. Promise that it will not do anything stupid,that idiot isn't worth anything. See you soon. I come too! - Where are you going? H?l?ne's in trouble.I'll go to see her. At this time?Are you mad? - I'll explain later. - But it's dinner time. I don't eat at home! Do not try to understand them, Andr?. This is a woman's thing. When I think at what he did to us, I should do I crazy thing! - I want to play this on him! - Then what should I say? I betrayed my husband. My life is ended. When his mother said that he was bethroted, I thought would die. I don't envy that girl. She may keep such a fiancee. - What was his mother like? - Educated. - And the house? - Beautiful. Stop talking about him! You lied talking about a lover! He dared to visit H?l?ne in college a girl that he just met! If you knew what he told me about you... You don't know what he told me about you! What if we write a letter? We may inform his fiancee . I'd like to strangle him with my own hands! I swear, if I catch him he will pay... Go open the door. Hello, H?l?ne. I'm glad to see you again. I was afraid you went to the concert with your parents. Sorry for our meeting. I was sick. Are you alone? May I enter? What a fog! You smoke so? Sabine, Agathe! What a surprise! I didn't know you were here. It seems you weren't bored all the three of you. You offer me a drink? How is your fiancee? Well, thank you. Don't you think it's time to explain yourself? Girls, it seems you aren't so happy as usual. If I may, we'll talk about it another time. Are you okay? And you, H?l?ne, you dissapoint me. I liked you a lot. But,all this is very sad, I prefer to leave. No, Julien. You're not going to get away so easily. - You won't let me get out? - No! Worse for you! You wanted it! But , pay attention, I will harm you! We will see!Three women against a man! Come on, girls! Well, hold on! You asked for it! You will pay for it! Help! Catch him! My father's porcelain! Let's break in. Help me, come on, that! One, two! One, two! Wait. Light a match! What ?! The gas! I didn't turn it off correctly! Look! He escaped through the window! That wretch! Who knows where he has dissapeared. - Two weeks, and didn't show up. What is he doing? Maybe the wretched one thinks we are still in love with him! Maybe he is praising himself for beating us ! Three other victims for his collection. I should have stand it all, the insults, the hits... but all this indifference kills me! What can irritate him? I do not know. I'm thinking of it. Do you want to take a walk? The weather is wonderful. Andr?, leave us please. Poor Andr?. I feel sorry for him. Do you think he suspects someting? I don't know. I can't look into his eyes. Sometimes I 'd like to confess him everything. I would feel easier. Your daughter worries me. Don't you think she's been weird lately? No, I didn't notice anything. It seems nothing interest her. She locks in the bedroom with Sabine and she conspires who knows what! Maybe she's going through a crisis. I noticed that. She is so cold with me. Refuses to do the conjugal duties. I am not taking it any more. You must have patience. These things will be resolved in time. Patience It's easy to say! I do not know how to tell you... - Go try. You have to prove that you love her. Maybe try to be more misterious. Misterious? You must be on the same opinion, Andrea. - Women like the misteries. Between husmabd and wifer there are no misteries. The woman like the romantic man. Agathe wants only to love you. Is this for dinner? What a beauty! Delicious! Don't be afraid to cook more. See you tonight. Your husband left. What do you say if we call Julien? After what he did? You mustn't go after him , after what he did! We won't... Just to know if he is at home. It's ringing. Yes? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello! Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm so embarrassed, Helene. Because of you, you have been expelled from college I should't have visit you. I do not know what to do. I am crazy about you, H?l?ne. I swear you that this time I am true. You must believe me, H?l?ne. Believe me. Did you tell my father that I'm here? Yes, yes, he comes at once. - How are you, Dad? - Yes, well... I'm sorry I've kept you waiting. - Always very successful. - No... - I wanted to do again a registration.. - Here, you listen again to your recording. H?l?ne, my love, my tenderness... No, no, no, I don't want to listen listen it, thanks. Who is this H?l?ne? This is your record, mr Fenel. - Thank you. How much should I pay? No, you don't have to pay. It's a present. You put it in the "Profit and loses" count Thanks, Dad. - How is your finance? - Great! The wedding will be a month from now. I hope you'll come! No, better not. - Unless you want it. As you like. You know, I feel strange because I am marrying! How did you felt about? Me? I was terrified. It was like a jump in the dark. But I enjoyed the idea of having wife and children. You cann't imagine how happy I was when you were born. You were adorable. - Sensitive, intelligent. Yeah, growing up I've become damaged. Will you take long? Julien! I did not know you were here. Hello Mariana, how are you? - Fine thanks. - I leave you. Yes, wait for me in my office. Mariana looks great! She succeded to make me leave Therese. She is so sweet. Moreover, it's very confortable I 'm growing old. What were we talking about? I'm worried about you, Julien. There is no reason to worry, I assure you. I will pass the exams, as usual. No problem. Then I will go in army. And then I have a nice job that is expecting me. But I'm not talking about it. So what's the problem? Your wedding, for example. You are getting married a foreigner. When you first met her, she didn't speak French. But now she speaks well. - Yes. And so we noticed that is a little naive. You are exaggerating, dad. I agree that she is not very smart, but she is beautiful, educated and from a good family. You are very pride for seducing this girl. But your feelings for her don't go beyond that. I think it's tragic to see you, thinking of getting married without love. This shows the dryness of your heart, which dismays me. Why? Your dream was that I fall in love? Love is the best feeling that can happen. Why wouldn't I want that for you? Well, dad, your desire is fullfilled. At this moment, I am in love. - Really? - Yes. So the record is for her? Yes. You see, I can be stupid, as the others. Really? But why all this? Don't you have her phone number? I don't have the courage to call her. I behaved badly to her. I courting her, in the same time with her two other friends. Besides, she knows that I'm getting married soon. - Are you still getting married? - Of course. Is she married the one that you love? No, she's just a girl. You just left the monastery. Now you are courting the under 18 girls ! What are you thinking of doing with this miss? I will ask her to be my lover. And you pretend that you love her? If you should be, you'd would't be thinking of sleeping with her! It's a monstruous thing, come on! Father, you'd change your mind if you see her. What attitude! When I think that instead of you, I could have had a daughter, and that she found someone like you! I'm terrified! You are wonderful, father. I adore you. It will end badly, Julien. One day the poor ones that suffer will make a scandal, and that day you will not be worth anything. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! No! No, Sabine! No! No! - Hello, Agathe? - What? No. It's Andr?. Sorry to have called so late. Can I speak to her? Yes.. Sabine. Sabine! Sabine. Hello? I dreamed I was killing Julien. Really! How was it? I ran him over with the car. What a wonderful feeling! I can imagine. But, unfortunately, it's hard to do it in real life. Why? A kind of perfect murder. Maybe. But, first you do not have a car, and then you do not know how to drive. That's true. It's okay. Sorry to have waken you. Good night. What was it? Something serious? No, she called me to tell me a dream she had. At three in the morning? These are crazy things! What happened? Go back to sleep mother, it was nothing. Now I cann't sleep. Very well, I understood. Okay, I understood, I understood. Hello, beautiful lady. Your husband is not here? Since where I left you everything is all right in your family? My throat aches a little... Can you prepare me a syrup? I will prepare it at once, Julien. You will like it. POISON. Here, take. Your throat will get better. Thank you, my love. CONTRE_POISON You took the whole blanket! Julien Fenal do you accept Anita Perez as your legitimate wife? No! Yes. I need to go to the bathroom. Bathroom CAUTION! Door opens in the road! There. I didn't wake her, she's sleeping as an angel. This record is nice. Who should have sent it? - Yeah. It should not be so important. My little dear H?l?ne, my love, my dear... After what happened I did not dare to ..... - What? - Quiet! I want so much to hold your hands Embrace you, my love... - It's him! The lover! - What? My daughter has a lover? on your big eyes, on your long hair... Your smile is so sweet.. You make me crazy, Helene I am so sorry, it was my fault that you were expelled.. - Look, this sinner! Calm down, calm down! If I knew his name, I would beat him! You can do it, Dad. His name is Julien Fenal. I am not his lover, I swear! Is that young one that came here with Sabine? I knew it! I told you! I realized that he was a scoundrel! You were right, Dad! That young man is abominable! I hate him, and I don't want to see him anymore! And then in a month he will be married. That boy is strange! In a month he will be marry and sends records to my daughter! But why did you say that he was your lover, little unfortunate girl? I do not know, I said. It was something spontaneous - Dad! Your mother is right! An educated girl doesn't have to tell that she has a lover! Especially when this is not true! -So? - A disaster. She didn't answer any question. Answer, miss. What are the requirements to have a marriage of convenience. Did you understand the question? The question? Yes. The problem is the answer. Don't try to use your charm, I'm a family man. It's a difficult question. I will have to postpone your exam. But I don't understand you. According to your notebook you have great votes How is your marriage? Very bad. We'll probably get divorced. - And you with your parents? - Terrible. It was very difficult to convince them to come here. A complete fiasco! Life! What crap. I also say so... And all because of that scoundrel! If I could catch him! When I think that this night I was killing him. It was wonderful. What a disappointment when I woke up... How strange that the three of us had the same dream. And what a dream! With all these dreams, in the end, we are really going to kill him! Shut up! Are you crazy? Honestly, I wouldn't have any remorse. Me either. You are not meaning that. You would do something horrible like that? Why not? Look at her face. - Is white as a bed sheet. I hate Julien, too. But I don't want he to be killed! If you don't stop talking like that, I will call the police. It's because he sent her a record. He didn't send us one, because he knew that he was wasting time. How naive you are! You still don't understand? That boy can't prove any feeling. Is a monster! It's not true. He regreted the things that he did. Forget it, Agathe! She is really stupid! What are you doing here? How did you get in? By the window. I must have seen you. Did you get my record? Get out! I don't want to see you anymore! - You must believe me. - You can say what you want, I don't believe you anymore! I think of you constantly. It haven't felt like this before. If you go on avoiding me, I will be sick. I love you, H?l?ne. I adore you. - And your fiancee? Let's not talk about her for the moment. On the contrary, let's talk about her! Do you still want to marry her? I don't know. But love and marriage are two different things. And I'm speaking about love. Don't you understand? You really are a monster! Marguerite! Did you heard? Go away! No, I don't want to believe. I defy you to say that you don't love me. You are a monster! If you don't leave now, I will wake up the whole house! - You would not do that. - We will see! - Marguerite! - Help! - Dad! - Marguerite! - Where is the gun? - Help! Help! Help! Dad! ?douard! Please! It's him again! I'm going to kill him! ?douard! No! Don't shot! If you hadn't stopped me I would have finished him as a dog! He tried to rape my daughter! I would have been acquitted. Calm down! Please! The people like that hasn't the right to live! He deserve to die 100 times! The next time I will not miss him! You're absolutely right, Dad. He deserved to die a hundred times. A revolver? Are you crazy? Where did you get it? It's my father's. Look.. A knife...Why not an ax? He's not stupid as he may seems, dear. With a knife, I guarantee success! Don't speak so loud, Sabine! That guy is spying us. With the revolver you are always condemned. It means premeditation. Understood? - And with the knife you are discharged? - Of course! We will say that it was killing in self-defense. He wanted to rape us. We defended ourselves with something handy. Understood? I find it difficult enough. First, the death should happen in the kitchen. And this is not an ideal place. And, who's going to stab him? You or H?l?ne? Because, I'm out of the question. Thank you, sir, you are very kind. Take care, you are clumsy! - We should not call attention! Is really not the right moment! You are doing it on purpose ?! Thank you, sir! You are really kind. I don't speak English, sir. A pistol and a knife. Very sexy, right? Let me show you something. What is it? Listen carefully. That's what we'll do: Little H?l?ne. Dear H?l?ne... Hello? What a surprise! Is it you, H?l?ne? I've never been so happy to hear somebody's voice. - Really? Of course, it's true. You know, I think about you a lot. I've behaved like a bastard. And I was so sorry... I love you, H?l?ne. - Honestly. - Oh! Do not listen to him, is lying. I am so happy that you have forgiven me. I didn't forgive you at all! I will never forget what you put me through! Not what you did with Sabine and Agathe! I never loved them! I just wanted conquer them. Only that! - Don't you believe me? - Yes. Fix the appointment! Julien, I'm uncomfortable talking on the phone... We need to see each other. - I'm looking forward to it! - Can we see each other now? - I run at once! Where are you? I am at home. You can come. I am alone. Ok! I'm coming! What a bastard! Hello, my son! Mama, you showed up at the wrong time, I'm leaving. It just take a minute. I must tell you something. I do not know why you like this miserable place instead of your house. Mom, I don't want to argue again, please! A button is missing from your shirt. It doesn't matter, the belt covers that part. Are you happy? It's been a long time since I've seen you like this. Are you preparing a dirty trick? I'm sorry, but I have to go. If you have something to say, say it! I wanted to give you some tips for tonight. Anita is very nervous. She does not understand your behavior. She never sees you. And her parents keep pestering me. I'm counting on you, try to be irresistible tonight. You know they are a little snob. They are very snob, let's don't speak anymore. Come on,let's go, mama. It's bad to put the key under the rug. It's okay. But what if he was telling the truth? If he really loved me? If he really loved you, we would retired you. We would gave you our blessing. - Wouldn't we? - Of course! This is the friendship. Julien has never loved you. Otherwise, he would have married you, and leaved his fiancee. Instead, not a word about this. - You think I'm stupid, right? Well, not at all! We also were like you. Only that now we understand. Can we count on you? - You are really decided? - Yes. Then you must will keep him here for an hour until we... H?l?ne, you know Julien. He will try to make peace by any means. - You won't surrender? - No, no. - Swear? - I swear! It's okay. Come on. Good luck! Won't you tell me who are you meeting? Are you hiding something from your mother? - Maybe the brunette one, called H?l?ne... - Yes, it is her. I knew it! I forbid you to see her! Mother, don't be a dictatress it doesn't suit you! I am not being a dictatress I am only asking you not to go! Your wedding is in two weeks! Maybe I'm not going to get married! I have not made up my mind yet! Are you sure your parents will not come back? No, they will not. They went to a restaurant, before going to the concert. I feel shy. I am nervous. Really?You weren't the other day. You see.. I'm ashamed to be in the same room with you. I'm sorry for the things that happened. Sit down. Do you want something to drink? No, thank you. I don't know what miracle made it possible to see you again.. but I swear I will take advantage of it. I don't want to leave you without convincing you: I love you. You are the only woman that counts for me. Continue. I have a lot of time. How fortunate that the doorman didn't see us. Here! Hold it. How strange. The key is not there. Ussualy is there. Beware, someone is coming. We will act normal... It seems that noone answers. Probably not is at home. You acted very well. I'm not to blame if he did not leave the key there. You are stupid! And if we'd leave? Lucky that I'm here! Go ahead, open up. - I'm so scared. - Not now! Quickly! I love you! I love you! I love you! Your imagination is poor. You repeat the same words. I'm sorry, but I have to go to the concert. I'm going to change. You can keep talking. I can hear. Why are you silent? Look, H?l?ne. Do you know what I'm going to do this evening? At a party organized by my fiancee's parents. And this same evening I will break up the engagement. - It can't be true? - Yes. And then I'll talk to your father. If you agree, a month from now we get married. Julien! What a mess! - Is it a problem if the bottle has a lid? No, I'm going to make a hole in the lid. Are you sure the autopsy will not find anything? No. I am informed. My Father said that if he were to kill someone, he would do it with this. This poison does not leave any traces. Come on. Julien. Do you drink milk? Milk? Well, yes, sometimes I drink, like everyone else. - Do you have milk in your house? There's a bottle in the fridge. Why? Promise me you will not question me. If you ask me so... I'll do what you say. Promise me you will not drink a single drop of milk. Promise me! I promise you! I've done it! Do you think it was enough? Just a few drops are enough. The poison is strong. - Will the taste change? No, it hasn't any flavour.It mixes well with the milk. What a mess! What do we do? We need to clean everything, otherwise Julien will notice that somebody has been at his home. With milk does not work. There is any other poison? Yes, the bottle is almost full. - Can you put a little here? In the cheese? You are crazy! We will try something else. - Should we renounce? - It's now or never! Wait. I have another idea. See. You can inject a little poison into the chocolate. It's more complicated. Besides, I'm nervous, and I do not know what's going to happen. Okay, let me try! Go fix the kitchen! And clean the floor! See. What do you think? Cann't see the difference. Save everything. Well... It seems everything is all right. Come on. After what I said - he will not drink milk... But if anyone else drinks? The maid, for example. . How do I get rid of my fiancee? Good question. I'm glad you came to talk to me. For the first time, my experience with women will serve at something. What if only I told her the truth? "Dear Anita, while you were in Brazil I met a beautiful girl." No, exactly that you musn't tell her! You should never say you don't love her, specially when you are separating. You must say that you love her, and that you have never loved anyone else... They love it. But if I want to leave her, I must say the reason, no? Yes, certainly... We have to find a reason. A button is missing on your shirt. Is hiden with the belt. After you make certain your feelings for her, the woman will be ready to swallow anything. Do not eat it! A friend made me a joke. It is not ordinary chocolate. It has a different quality. It has an aphrodisiac effect. I don't know if you understand me. Interesting. This product should be effective. I don't think Anita will be angry with me. That marriage was the result of a rash decision. At least on my part. And I am not the kind of husband for her. - If she knew... - Come on, she won't understand. I still need to find a reason. Relax, I will find you perfectly ten reasons ! That's serious, sir. - I know I know. How could this happen? I do not understand, Inspector... I always carry the keys with me... - What happened? This is my daughter, Agathe. Your father is desperate, they stole a vial of poison. Yes. Anita, I need to talk to you. - Sit down. - I'm listening. First of all,want to emphasize, that the feelings I have for you, haven't changed. I still love you. Exactly on this purpose I put myself some questions. - What kind of questions? About marriage. You know, that I will have to go in the army. Well, I'm not the first woman whose husband was sent to the army. I'm sure you will be great in uniform! The question is not this. I need to make you a confession. It turns out that... Many times I happens that... Well, tell me! What is happening to you? "If you knew how little meaning has the life and how sweet is the death which follows it". What are you saying? And yet, why speak of a hidden treasure, whose spirit has not yet been revealed? What? Poliuto fourth act, third scene. Look, how beautiful is this phrase . I love you! Much more than me, but less than God above! What do you want to say, Julien? You will be surprised to hear this... especially of me... But I think about going to a monastery. - In a monastery? - Yes. I was drawn to the contemplative life... That silence... that peace... So, I think about marriage... Will I make you happy? - Did you say something? No, nothing, I'm listening to you. Very interesting. Go ahead, continue. There is no one. Turn on the light. We get the chocolate and leave. H?l?ne, what are you doing here? I betrayed you. I came to throw the milk out. I love Julien, he loves me! Let's get married. God! What a mess! - The chocolate is gone! - Really? Oh, that's terrible... We killed him! - H?l?ne has not returned yet... - Silence! You can't be here! - How dare you! Hello, Mr. Maroni. - I don't want to see you again! But we need to talk. - I said I don't want to see you again! - Listen to me! - Get out! Or I'll beat you! But sir, I love your daughter! - I don't want you to talk about her! Yes, listen! I don't want to listen! I love your daughter! - What? I want to marry her! - How? - I want to marry her! You already have a fiancee! - That has already been solved! - What? - I broke up with her! - As? I broke up with her! I'm tired of being deceived by an idiot! No, Anita. Think about your family. Your life will be over - if you do! The time has come to give the terrible sentence. My heart is afflicted, because of this premeditated murder, which has been avoided by chance. And this concludes the trial. Is a sort of experience, that gives you a good dose of philosophy. Such cases teach how to appreciate time. You know, I have been paralyzed for more than a month. - But the poison is powerful! I'm healthy as a bull. Neither can I complain, I was shot three times from a short distance! And I'm here. And the leg will heal? Yes, that bastard wanted to cut it. - Whole? Yes, on the thigh. But I refused. And I was right... I'm amazed, and with horror, I ask for these depraved young people, the maximum penalty. The age of the accused mustn't be a reason of pity.. Your husband is still mad about you, aren't you happy? Through these beautiful young faces, You will see the true face of corrupted youth. Subjects influenced by the modern literature and by the criminal instincts... I bet a kiss that a week from now we will celebrate H?l?ne's wedding! What do you think, H?l?ne? I should like. ... Like me, you condemn the creations of God, that , should have been angels, but instead they are demons. It's the turn of the defense. President, Your Honor... Look at this defense! I'm fascinated by him. Lords jurors, Girls relax, I assure you the absolution. You said that we would be discharged, and we ended up with six months! It was a fatality. I will be released tomorrow! They reduced my sentence! Ugly stupid! You should be hanged in public for what you did! I won the bet! I told you we would be at H?l?ne's wedding! She marries in jail, but she marries! Do you accept H?l?ne Maroni as your legitimate wife? Yes. Misses, continue to work!
