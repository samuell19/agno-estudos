Original Por. Subtitles By: "Luís Filipe Bernardes" Translated Into English By: Chuck Hello? Yes! Oh, it's you. I'm fine, very well. No-no-no I just got in. I went to a party with... Oh, I had a marvelous time... You aren't jealous, are you? "This is to tide you over." Hello? Hello. Yes, is that you? Yes I'm fine. Hello? Oh no, oh madam you've got a crossed line. Would you please ring off? No-no, you ring off! No-no, this is not Dr. Weinsberg's. It is... (Stammers) It's 1507. Well this is ridiculous, I've got a crossed line. Hello, darling? No madam, what do you want me to do about it? Oh, you are being extremely unpleasant. Listen... My fault?! Well certainly not! Not at all! Now, somebody is trying to call me, and you keep butting in. You've got a crossed line!! Please ring off! Plea-- Hello? Yes, thank heavens for that! Yes, I'm... Oh... Oh I can't... Darling, it's very difficult to hear you. I said... I can't hear you. Yes, but you sound very far off... Oh this is terrible! everybody's on the same line. No... Oh now there's somebody else again. No, darling-darling... Hang up and ring again. Let the operator do it? I said hang up and ring again! Yes, call me back! Um... yes. What? No, I'm not Dr. Weinsberg. Oh no! Yes? Ah, at last. At last, it is you. Yes, very well. Mm-hmm, I'm fine. Yes, it was terrible, I couldn't hear you... ... with all those people chattering away at the same time. The telephone service in this country is getting worse all the time! No... no-no oh?! you were lucky. Yes, I just got in ten minutes ago. You hadn't called before, had you? No... Uhmm... I had uh... I had dinner at Margaret's, mmhmm... Oh, it must be eleven-fifteen, I... Are you at home? Well then, what time is it, by that nasty little clock by your bed? Yes, but I thought... What? Last night? Well, I went to bed straight away... I knew I couldn't sleep, so I took a sleeping pill. No, no-no only one. Why yes, just one pill. Mmmm, oh I did... Until 9 o’clock this morning. I had a bit of a headache, but I put myself together. Yes, then Margaret came, and we lunched and... I did a bit of shopping, and then I came back and... ... I put all the letters in the yellow box, and I also... What dear? No, very well. Honestly, I am very brave. Mmm-hmm! A stiff upper lip! After wards, I changed and Margaret came to fetch me. Well there you are. I've only just gotten back. Hm? Well... my-my gray suit. Yes, and the black hat, yes. The one you like. Yes, I've still got it on. I'm standing here with it on. No, I'm not smoking. No-no. I only smoked three cigarettes today. True, three. Honestly... Ah, you're sweet. And what about you? You just got in? You haven't been out? What case? Oh yes. When does it come up to court? Darling, you-you mustn’t over-work. Hm? No, no, I'm here. No the-- What B--? Oh, yes, the box... with the letters. What do you want me to do? Will you send someone for them? Well I'll post them, if you like. Well of course it's difficult, but... Oh no, darling, you mustn’t apologise. It's only natural, and I... I'm being silly. Oh you're sweet... Yes, you are. Neither did I. I didn't think I could be so strong. "Your fault" ? No! No, but you're not to blame yourself, in the least bit. No, darling, on the contrary. No but we-- No, we always agree to be absolutely honest with each other. It wouldn't have been very honest... if you had left, without letting me know until the last minute. Yes, that would have been cruel. This way, I had time to get used to the idea. ... and to understand. Oh! What do you mean, "play acting" ? Who is? No-ho-ho-ho. Do you think I'm making it up? Don't you know me better than that? No, I haven't got it in me. No not at all. Not in the least. I am absolutely calm. You would hear it in my voice, anyway. I said: You would hear it in my voice. My voice doesn't sound as if I'm trying to hide something, does it? No... I've just made up my mind, to be brave. And I will be. Oh no, let me... No, darling. No-no, But that wasn't the same thing. I know, darling, but that wasn't the same. You can live your whole life waiting for a disaster... Expecting it... It can still break you, when it comes! I don't want you to blame yourself. Listen, it is all my fault. It is my fault! Yes it is... Do you remember that Sunday at Windsor? That first Sunday, Allan yes! Well, it was I who wanted to come... I who said: That I didn't care about anything. No! No, no, no... I telephone--Yes, I telephoned first. You were too shy. On a Tuesday. No, Tuesday... I'm positive, Tuesday the 27th. Your telegram came on Monday the 26th. You may be sure that I know those dates by heart. Your mother? Oh no... But darling why? No, but... I'll be alright! Yes, of course I will. Oh no. Well, I don't know yet I... Yes, perhaps... It's not necessary. Certainly not at once. Listen, darling, what about you? Tomorrow? I didn't realize it was... So soon. I didn't realize... I'm still here. If it is to be tomorrow... it-it's quite simple really... I've put the yellow box downstairs with the housekeeper. And then you can send somebody to pick it up anytime you like. Yes... Oh, I don't know... Margaret has asked me to the country, for a few days but... I don't know yet. What? Oh... He is here. (The Dog) He's a soul in torment! He spent all yesterday between the hall and the bedroom. Hm... Yes, he was lying with his chin on the rug looking at me. He kept pricking up his ears and listening. He made me think that, he'd heard you come! And then... Then he look around at me... He seemed to be blaming me, for not helping you. To look for you. I think it would be much better if you kept him. Yes... But if the poor thing is to be unhappy... No-no. He isn't a woman's type of dog! I wouldn't take care of him properly, I wouldn't take him out for his walks and... No, it would be much better if you took him. He'd soon forget me. No... it isn't-it isn't really so difficult. Can't you say he belonged to a friend? But what about Henry? Henry likes dogs, couldn't-- Couldn't Henry come and take him? Is-is Henry going to get somebody else to share the apt. with? Now that you're leaving? Oh! I can't keep the dog! It's impossible. No, no, I'm-- Yes, of course, darling. We'll see. Yes-yes, I promise, we'll see. What gloves? Oh, your, driving gloves. I don't know, I haven't seen them. Yes maybe, I-I'll go and have a look. Hm... yes, hold on, I'll-I'll... Don't get cut off! Yes hold on. I'll take a look. Hello? No, I've looked everywhere. On the dressing table, in the wardrobe, everywhere. But they don't seem to be here. Listen... Well I'll look again, but I'm quite sure. Yes, I know you are.... yes... If by any chance they turn up by tomorrow, I'll put them downstairs, with the yellow box, huh? Well your letters? Yes? You'll burn them? Listen, I'm going to ask you something silly. No, no, look... If you do burn the letters that you wrote me. Would you please keep the ashes? ... and put them in that little cigarette box that... that I gave you... No-no. No-no darling. Yes I know I'm stupid. No... I am quite brave you know! Yes... No no no! No I'm alright. I'm alright! There... it's over, it's over now. Yes... Yes... I'll just blow my nose. But I would like to keep those ashes... Thank you! Yes, I mean it. Work? Oh! You're not going to work at this time of night? Can't it wait? Yes, yes of course, I know it's important but... I mean, you mustn't over-work. You must go to bed, if you have to get up so early in the morning... What did you-- You can't hear me?! But I am speaking quite loud?! Is this better? I said: "is this better?" Oh that's strange, because I can hear you so well. Just as if you were in the same room! Hello? Hello? Oh that's it, now I can't hear you... Yes, but you sound very far off... And you can hear me? It's my turn then? Ha-ha No, no-no darling don't hang up! Please, don't hang up, because it'll come back. There! There you see? You're back and I can hear you again. Yes, I hate that. It's like being dead. You can hear but, you can't make yourself heard. Yes, oh yes... Much better, even better than before. There is a strange sort of echo over your phone... It doesn't sound like your phone at all. Yes, your phone always sounds the same. Whenever I listen to you, I can see you. You know? Yes I can! You're wearing? Oh well... No, no-no not pajamas. You're still in your shirt sleeves. Which tie? You think I can't? The blue one with the gray pattern. Yes, and you have in your left hand, you have the receiver... Yes. That's easy, I know. And in your right... You have a pen, you are doodling on a pad. Yes, faces. Stars, hearts. You're laughing, huh? Oh my darling... You see, I have eyes instead of ears. Oh no... Whatever you do, don't look at me. No. Please... Afraid? No, I'm not afraid... It's worse than that. I've grown out of the habit, of sleeping alone. Yes. Yes. I will. Oh my darling, yes, I promise. I promise you. No. No I don't look in the mirror anymore. I did a little while ago... And I found myself face to face with an old woman. Yes, an old woman with, white hair, and a mass of little wrinkles. Oh, thank you, that's-that's very kind. "A remarkable face." There's nothing worse! That's for actors. I liked it much better, when you used to call me "monkey face." Yes... Yes, my dear sir. What... no-no I was joking! Oh, stupid... I'm glad you're tactless, and you love me... Because... ... if you didn't love me and you were tactful, The telephone could, become a terrifying weapon! Noiseless and leaving no trace. Ah? Me, wicked? No-ho-ho I--- Hello? Hello? Oh darling?! Where are you... where are-- Hello?! We've been cut-off. "I shall always love you." Hello, operator. Would you please dial Flaxman 4924? Yes, please... Flaxman 4924. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Hampstead 1507. It's engaged all the time! Well I've been trying it for hours! Please would-- Yes? They are speaking... Thank you. Oh hello darling! Oh, those stupid people cut us off and I-- Oh, Henry? Yes, I thought... I thought it was... Yes, I was speaking to him a moment ago. Not in? Yes. Yes. Oh, he isn't coming back tonight huh? Hmm? ... Yes, of course. Oh how stupid of me, of course! Yes I remember now... He was telephoning from a restaurant. You know, we were just cut-off and I-- Yes-yes of cou-- Of course! Right you are. Yes. Oh, thank you, I'm fine Henry. And you? Good. But I'll... I'll... What do you mean, with you? Well, no Henry, no... No, I'm sorry. Well I... I'm going to the country for a few days. Well I don't know, a few days. Yes. But what's the point? Yes, I know we get along fine... Henry... I'm going to hang-up now. Good night, Hen... You know there is no harm in it, I... No, no, I-I'm not offended. Good night, Henry. Hello? Yes, we were cut-off. No, I was waiting for you to call back. I was engaged? Oh yes. Yes, the telephone rang, and I answered, but no one was there. I don't know. Of course. Yes. You are sleepy? Yes I understand. It's good of you to call back. Very good. Listen, darling... Listen, I have never lied to you. Yes, I know, I know. Yes... I believe you, Darling... You don't have to convince me, It isn't that. It's just that, I have lied to you. Yes, just now. Yes, over the phone. For the last half hour I've been lying to you. You see... I wasn't telling the truth when I told you how I was dressed. ... and that I had dined with Margaret. I haven't dined and I'm not wearing my Grey suit. I'm wearing my nightgown. Yes. And... I haven't eaten, I haven't dressed, I haven't been out all day. Because... No, I'm wearing... I'm wearing a coat, over my nightgown. Because while, while looking at the telephone ...and waiting for your call. And starring at the phone. And sitting down and getting up... And walking up and down, I felt I was... I was going mad! Mad! You see? So I put a coat on, and I was going to.. Get down and get a taxi. And drive up in front of your house. in front of your windows... to wait. Aahhhh! To wait... I don't know what for-- Yes, I know, darling, but I am, I am... Yes? I haven't eaten. I couldn't. I've been ill. Yes, last night I wanted to take a sleeping pill. I thought that if I took more I would sleep better. And if I took the lot! I would sleep without dreaming. Without waking up. I would be dead! Yes, yes, like a sledgehammer. But I did dream. I dreamt the truth. Then I woke up suddenly and was so pleased it was only a nightmare... And then when I realised it wasn't a nightmare. it was the truth. I was alone. Your arm was not around me and my head was not on your shoulder. I felt I couldn't live. I simply couldn't live! I took fourteen, in hot water. Cold as air... Yes, light and cold... And I couldn't feel my heart beating anymore... ... and death was a long time coming. Then I had this terrible pain. And...after an hour, I telephoned Margaret. I didn't have the courage to die alone. Oh! I'm so weak, stupid! I wasn't going to tell you anything about this. I was-- I didn't want you to worry. Darling... Cause all I do, is to make you suffer, to make you miserable. Yes, speak, speak, say something! Anything. You know, I was in such pain, I could have crawled on the floor... And you'd only have to speak to me, to make me feel better. Sometimes when we were in bed, When your arm was around me, my head on your chest... ... and you were talking, I could hear your voice exactly, as I do now over the telephone. No! No coward? Oh my darling no! I am the coward! And I've sworn to myself that... No, but you... But you ha-- No, you have never given me anything but happiness. Oh, my love. Now I tell you that is not true at all! Because I knew. Yes, I knew right from the beginning, I knew. I expected what has happened... Yes... because you are young. It's got everything to do with it. No, my darling, I'm not a romantic. Most women think that they are going to spend their life with the man they love... ... and it's a shock to them, when it comes to an end. But I knew. I'd even seen her... Well, I didn't tell you but... I-I'd even seen her. Well her-- Her photograph. I didn't want to spoil our last weeks together. No, it's only natural... Oh, don't make me out, better than I am. I can hear music?! I said... I can hear music. Oh... Henry... Henry's record player. He is quite into bad habits, since you are not living at home anymore. Yes, do that. Have Henry to turn it off. Hello. Yes, that's better. Yes... Henry turned it down, did he? ... Listen, why can't you... No, nothing. No. Nothing. No. No-no-no... No-no, the doctor will call back tomorrow. Yes, well he's a very good doctor. It will only upset him, to call in another Doc-- I understand we must. Yes of course. Of course it is. But if you hadn't phoned, I would have died. Yes, I have lots of courage. No! Listen, wait! Wait, let us find a way! Forgive me, forgive me, I know this scene is unbearable. And your very patient my darling but... Please understand that I am in agony. Yes... this thin wire is the last thing that links us. Do you know what I did last night? I took the telephone to bed with me. No... In bed with me. Yes. Yes, because, we are after all, connected by the telephone. And then I dozed off and dreamt all kinds of things. And... I knew you would give me a ring. But it became a different and dangerous kind of ring. The ring of the neck... ... that strangles you. A boxing ring, I couldn't get out of. The bell rang, you hit me, And I was counted out. And then I was at the-- At the bottom of the sea... Yes... it looked very much like the rooms in Wigmore St. Yes... and I was connected to you... By a diver’s air tube, and I was begging you not to cut it. Well you know, how silly dreams sound when you try to explain them... But at the time they are so real and... ... so frightening. Because you are speaking to me. For 5 years, I've only lived through you... ... and only breathed freely in your presence. I've spent every waking hour waiting for you... thinking I were dead if you were late. And dying at the thought of your being dead. Then, when you came, I could breathe again. And then at last, when you were there... I would die, for fear of your going. Now I can breathe again because you are speaking to me. So, my dream is not so foolish. When you cut the connection, you snap the air tube I'm holding onto for dear life. No... no, darling, of course I slept. Yes, I slept. The doctor said that even after you get rid of the pills... You'll sleep... yes. Besides the pain distracts you. Yes, it's a novelty, and you can bear it. What is unbearable, is the second night, yesterday. And the third, tonight. In a few minutes... and tomorrow... And the day after... And the day after and days and days and days... ... doing what?! Oh my God! Oh no! I am not ill, no. I'm not, I'm not the slightest feverish, no. Everything is very clear. If it only wasn't so clear, clear, cold and empty. There is no solution. I should have been brave enough to lie to you. Well what's the use? What's the use of going to sleep?! Even if I can go to sleep, After going to sleep there is waking up... And dreaming... getting up, bathing, eating! Going out? And going where? Where shall I go?! But I've never had anything to live for but you. No, I tell you, I don't need anyone. A distraction? Yes, I'll tell you something. It is not very poetical, but it is true. Since that night you told me, The only distraction has been at the dentist when he touched a nerve... Alone... Alone! Julius? Yes, he is here. I don't want to make a fuss of him. To stroke him... He wont let anyone near him. Mmmm, he's quite a different dog, and I'm afraid of him. I understand him only too well, he loves you and... You don't come here anymore and he thinks it's my fault. No, forget it... No, please darling, it's--a--th--- Hello? Hello?! Please get off the line. No-no-no, you're interrupting a private-- No, madam, we are not trying to be interesting?! All we want, is for you to get off the line. Ww-- Please... Well if you think we're so ridiculous... Why are you wasting your time listening, instead of hanging up? Ah... Darling... Oh, my... Oh, my love, no... No-no, she rang off... She rang off after right after that nasty remark. Oh, you're upset?! Oh, but don't let a stupid woman like that upset you! Well she doesn't know you. She thinks you are like other men. No, dar-- Butt guilty? Guilty about what? How naive you are. No... Listen, the other-- What? No, no... Well let her listen, it doesn't matter. The other day I met that woman whose name begins with... With umm T... Mmm-hmm. Yes. Yes T. J. T... yes. Grosvenor St., Mmhmm... Well... She asked me if you had a brother and if it was his marriage... ... that was being announced. Hmm? Oh, the truth, of course. The look of sympathy... Well I didn't waste much time with her. I said I had guests at home. Hm-hmm. Oh, darling, it's simpler than that. People hate being dropped, and I have gradually dropped everybody. Because I didn't want to lose a single minute of ours together. No-no darling, no you must be fair. People couldn't understand our position. Peop-- Peopl-- You either love each other. Or you hate each other. Yes, they give one quick look and-- You'll never make them understand certain things. No? Oh, you'd better be like me. Don't give a damn! Ah... ah... Oh, no nothing darling, No nothing, but I talk and talk... I think were back as we were before... ... and then suddenly the truth hits me. No. Oh no... No, because before we could see each other. Yes, we could do crazy things, we could forget our promises... You could convince me that you loved me, with a kiss and a hug. One look could change everything! Yes, but-but this... With this machine! What is finished, is finished for good! What? No, no darling, don't worry. One doesn't try to commit suicide twice. Well, perhaps to try to sleep. No, I couldn't buy a gun... Can you see me going into a shop, buying a gun? Where would I find the strength to invent a story, my poor darling? Yes... none... Maybe I should have had... There are times when lies are useful. Supposing... Supposing that... ... that you were lying to me to make our parting less painful. No-no-no darling, I didn't say that you were lying, I said "if" you were lying. If, for example, you were not at home and you told me... No, no-no... darling, darling... But I believe you did, I didn't mean to say that I didn't. Oh, why are you cross? Yes, you're speaking quite angrily to me! No but all I meant to say was that if you were lying to me, out of kindness... ... and I knew it. I would only love you all the more! Darling... I-- (Line Clicks) Hello? Hello Hello?! Oh my God... Oh God! God, make him call me again! God... make him call me again. God, make him call me again. God, make him call me again. God, make him call... God, make him call me again!! God, make him! Hello... yes, darling, yes we were-- Listen, I was just trying to explain that if you were lying to me out of kindness ... and I noticed it, I would only be all the fonder of you. Yes. Of course. You are crazy. My love... My dear love. Yes, I have a feeling of being so close together... and suddenly there are cellars and underground passages... The whole town rises up between. Remember Ivana asking how the voice could come through all the twists in the wire? I have the wire around my neck now. Your voice is around my neck. Yes, I know we must, but... ... I shouldn't have had the courage. Yes. Either that or we will shall sit here forever... ... and slowly starve. In 100's of years people will find our bones... And the strange wire around the vertebrae. I couldn't hang up... No I couldn't ever, darling. I know you can't either. I know it... It's even more painful for you, than for me. No. No... Le Tokay? Oh, darling, if you’re going to be in Le Tokay... ... tomorrow night, Would you then please not-- That is... please don't go to the same hotel where we used to go. Because... Things I can't imagine don't exist. They exist in a sort of vague way that... ... that hurts less. You understand? Thank you. I love you. Yes. Well... Well, until-- Ah-ha... I was going to say until tomorrow. Silly habits. I doubt it. But you never know. It's better... Ever so much better... My darling... My beautiful darling... Yes, I am brave. Be quick. Hang up. Quick! Break off... I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Original Por. Subtitles By: "Luís Filipe Bernardes" Translated Into English By: Chuck
