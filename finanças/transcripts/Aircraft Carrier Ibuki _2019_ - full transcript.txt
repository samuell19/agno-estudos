In the near future Territorial disputes in East Asian waters continue to intensify Kaledoruf, an island country located in East Asian waters Unite with neighboring countries that hate the interference of great powers Established a national community named after the East Asian Federation East Asian Federation incites radical nationalism Advocating the restoration of territories and the development of maritime forces The crisis of military conflicts off the coast of Japan is also approaching Approximately 450 kilometers west of Okinotori Island off the coast of the Haruma Islands December 23, 03:15 JST (Japan Standard Time) Patrol Ship Black Island The air pressure is dropping sharply The heavy rainfall area is approaching the ship 21 degrees 23 minutes north latitude 132 degrees 14 minutes east longitude There are 20 ships, so many I don’t look like a serious fishing boat, it’s bound for Chudao Captain, if those ships move on May cross the water boundary into the territorial waters Request support from the headquarters Yes Get down mushroom poster TTG Film source kokoben translation There were 20 fishing boats of unknown nationality early this morning translation Rain andSasa From the exclusive economic zone of the Hatsushima waters of the Teruma Islands to the territorial sea boundary The patrol ship in the Hauruma Special Control Area of ​​the Coast Guard Go to the scene urgently The fishing boat suddenly opened fire at 3:24 in the morning Touch the pear duck translation Communication was interrupted after Black Island reported that several people were injured The crew of the fishing boat boarded Hatsushima The maritime security officers may have been detained There is also news that a flag like a national flag has been raised in the middle of the island Fairy water Proofreading and post what Does it mean that Hatsushima is occupied? Armed forces disguised as fishermen Isn't it the East Asian Federation? Many neighboring countries have claimed ownership of the Boriu Islands shilly time Among them, the one who claims the strongest and repeatedly violated territorial water East Asian Federation 3 years ago they unilaterally announced the founding of the nation There is no international common sense The United States, China and Russia contain each other time Acha and painted face The UN can't intervene If they really came to take Hatsushima I have issued an order for maritime security operations Prime Minister, in this situation, you should order the defense to be deployed. Malala time Intelligence is not enough First determine the identity and purpose of the illegal lander Minister of Foreign Affairs, please check with relevant countries And file a complaint with the United Nations understood Maritime Self-Defense Force Has been urgently dispatched to conduct exercises in the southwestern waters of the Ogasawara Islands The 5th Guard Group headed to Hatsushima 5th Guard Group Is Iphone?

Main specifications of the aircraft-mounted frigate DDV192 Ibuki right Owning this is obviously against the constitution in our country What do you say No, Ibuki is just for defensive purposes Is a means of self-defense against war No aircraft carrier No aircraft carrier against war This is against the constitution For our country with 6,800 islands Ibuki Service Strong Guild Configure Ibuki to ensure air superiority By no means to break away from the purpose of defensive defense I am sure that I will not disappoint the people's expectations Against war offensive Captain, the commander is looking for you Please go back to the battle information center understood Captain Ibuki Ryota Akizu 1 Sa Sure enough, did the above ask for maritime security operations? I don't know where the other party is yet Xinbo, it's difficult to deploy defense If it is the East Asian Federation The number of weapons and personnel flowing through the peninsula should not be underestimated It used to be the station of the US military So familiar with the operation of the army If they have calculated that we will be dispatched Must have been calculated If you want to kill Japan Then they must really want Ibuki’s combat power data They will take the initiative to attack us Ensuring the aviation advantage of the sea area is the most important Having said that, at this time we have visitors on board Captain Akitsu was originally the ace pilot of the Air Self-Defense Force, right? I did fly a fighter jet So why did you become the captain of the aircraft carrier again? Should imitate the tradition of the US military The fighter pilot serves as the captain of the aircraft carrier But for the conflicting viewpoints that aircraft carriers are strategic weapons and specialized defenses What do you think? Does Japan need Ibuki This is not a question I should answer Please let me hear your thoughts as a captain Not a question I should answer So early Good morning early Just do it before breakfast The gap between us and online media is really getting bigger Your Toho Shimbun is so famous, why is it humble? Is this the interview yesterday Yes, there is no gain at all After all, this ship was controversial before it sailed. So I want us to interview to gain people’s understanding However, the captain didn’t mean to cooperate at all But the deputy captain is very kind Those two were classmates from the Defense University, they were vying for the first place. Then on to Ibuki, Mr. Shinba of the Maritime Self-Defense Force is the deputy captain. Mr. Qiuzu of the Air Self-Defense Force became the captain So there should be some reason, right That's it All relevant countries have denied any connection with this matter Because there is no formal diplomatic window with the East Asian Federation We are currently in contact with them through a third country Prime Minister Our country is under invasion Shouldn't we take strong and resolute measures? It feels very inconvenient to wear this action You can't play golf here, right? That's true Safety must be considered Yes Please wear this when you leave the room okay, I get it By the way, the maritime security operation was carried out because something happened? I'll explain this to you later Actually let us run into a security operation in Shanghai Nothing is luckier than this Since the establishment of the Self-Defense Forces, this order has only been issued three times. Mr. Yokoyama, right You deserve to be a reporter from University of Tanaka I really know the Self-Defense Forces Isn't that said? Only 2 of us out of 100 media Such good luck is still going on Stop the interview or something, please forgive me I'm sorry because this is no longer a sailing exercise Please try not to leave this non-commissioned officer preparation room Flipper No. 1 calls the Ibuki Battle Information Center A fishing boat sends out a rescue signal on the course Flipper Which country’s ship sent the rescue signal Unable to confirm Is it related to the first island landing?

It's safe in the room Please go in please go in Please, please, go in, please go in Isn't this being attacked? The submarine that attacked Ibuki escaped from the sea area at the scene The fishing boat also disappeared Prime Minister, this is the level of defense deployment, right? The new mobile unit is approaching the waters of the Boriu Islands Mobile force The Northern Fleet of the East Asian Federation is based on the aircraft carrier Gilxia It really is the East Asian Federation The prime minister, let's give the defense dispatch order. Prime Minister They sent an aircraft carrier The appearance looks like an old antique from a former communist country The internal structure is upgraded There are several carrier-based aircraft MiG-35 60 The air-to-sea alert level is raised to strict This is tricky commander Use a helicopter to transfer the reporters to the supply ship heading south. Ok this is better Ship sentinel, third deployment, first sentinel satellite telephone? I can’t use my phone at sea, so I told me to take it But you can’t send messages without permission Yes Good morning Good morning Good morning Good morning Good morning Good morning Good morning Miss Shaigu Someone posted this video on the Internet not long ago what You are also very beautiful today Thank you Seems something is burning Asked the Coast Guard No news of fires and accidents in large ships Know the location Have location information About 400 kilometers west of the Ogasawara Islands Zoom in Yes Huh, do you want to interview again? Mr. Fujitang, you really like boats Is it Ichu? Haven't we been in the Maritime Self-Defense Force special episode? Look at DDV192 Ichu DDV192 Ibuki Aircraft-mounted frigate The first aircraft-mounted frigate after the war The largest vessel of the Maritime Self-Defense Force 248m No way Damn Ah, she's on this ship right now Just above On top, Yuko interviewing Vice President Bates Regarding this unfair aggression against us We intend to retake the territory immediately I will convey it to the president who is attending the US-China-Russia trilateral meeting But I hope you can restrain yourself of course But we may have to use your country’s power as an ally I will convey it to Mr. President good luck Sonar buoy contact found submarine 20 miles ahead of the fleet, 320 depth No response to identification signal The commander is a submarine of the East Asian Federation On the heading to Boriu If we go straight, will there be a fight? Yes In this case, our challenge is inevitable Should be avoided Do not Should go straight This battle is also a battle against time If the enemy completes the defensive deployment Whether you want to recapture Hatsushima or rescue the maritime security officer Will become more difficult But in that case To succumb to threats or to fight The test is our consciousness Have you finished your two opinions? Yes it is good straight All members enter combat positions Repeat All members enter combat positions What are you fighting with? Faster Yes Emergency closing of the cabin door Drive to the front of Ibuki at maximum speed Maximum speed Maximum speed The artillery commander prepares to fight against the submarine Preparation for launch of submarine missile Ready to launch The sound of the torpedo tube opening Are you going to do it here? The morning tide also opened the torpedo tube Captain Qiujin, what's your judgment? The enemy's finger is already pulling the trigger We can avoid torpedoes in the sea But it’s dangerous to face the morning tide at close range If we do not act, we will be attacked I think the current situation meets the conditions of the attack Our mission is maritime security operations Except for legitimate defense, we cannot attack actively Obviously the current state of affairs is that we have been improperly violated Once you do it, it's war This is the obstacle we have to overcome 2 miles away 2 minutes to reach the goal Commander, please give an attack order If you sink an enemy submarine Not only will it affect the safety of Hatsushima’s marine protection team Will also create new excuses for the enemy to attack Do you want the morning tide ship as a living sacrifice? I didn't say that Trust the control skills of Captain Taki and his crew Alright We are not allowed to fire a bullet before the enemy fires Keep attacking and keep going Keep attacking and keep going Maintain course and speed Commander commander Send the commander to the infirmary stretcher commander Stretcher, hurry up Commander, are you okay? 1 minute to reach directly above the target 15 seconds 10 seconds Pass directly above the enemy submarine Didn't you call? The fleet broke through the predicted line of attack Ah great The enemy submarine’s course turned northeast and disengaged If everything is calm in the future The Ibuki will reach the waters of Kurume at 24:00 as planned They do well The nature of our country’s defense is not to evade. They showed this You are consequential If the enemy opens fire, I am afraid now Prime Minister We should immediately order the defense to attack However, Commander Wakui was seriously injured and unable to continue his command. Who will be the commander from now on Command will be transferred to Ibuki Captain Akizu Kazusa Akitsu This is Captain Akizu Kazusa I'm Qiujin, who is instructed to take over It is said that you are the youngest person to be promoted to Izuo It’s very hard to transfer from the Air Self-Defense Force to the Maritime Self-Defense Force. Are you still used to it? Once people get new toys, they will be eager to try It depends on whether the people who master it have firm mental preparation The warship that invested 300 billion in heavy taxes is a toy in his mouth Your idea is correct I hurt my ears, it feels like the sky is spinning, so troublesome Akitsu Kazusa I hand over the command of the Fifth Guard Group to you Yes As you wish Next time they will attack We must overcome this obstacle anyway What obstacle For those who try to violate our sovereignty Be prepared to face off So I don't escape Let the other party see our will to defend the country Will definitely die Since its establishment, it is the pride of our Self-Defense Force that no one died wrong What we are proud of is not that the Self-Defense Force did not have any dead It’s that in the decades after the war, no one died because of the war. If you die to protect the people Isn't this the long-cherished wish of the self-defense officer? Intervention in the tripartite containment of the United States, China and Russia See if we can get results that are beneficial to us Sawasaki Is the opponent’s purpose only to occupy Poliujian and make it a fait accompli? Restoration of the territory of the Kaledoruf Dynasty It is a convention that supports the military regime of the East Asian Federation But things will not be so simple Good or bad The world's dominant country has lost its original status Let national firstism spread all over the world Caused the rise of nationalist countries like the East Asian Federation But the armaments expanded so fast They can't do it on their own In other words, is there a country that is behind it? If you manipulate it behind your back, you can make the other party invisible Indeed, our country’s national strength and combat power are stronger than the East Asian Federation But if we enter a total war Both sides will be fatally injured Sawazaki Yusaku Director, Asian and Oceanian Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs On the territorial issue If Japan cannot maintain the status quo May be unavoidable But if not handled properly The war will spread to Asia, not the whole world The next 24 hours is the key Yes Thank you slow walk Thank you Shop manager, let me do it Great Look, the boots for Christmas candy are sold out Replenishment is hard to come I must step up now I will concentrate on this Yes That Xiaojing Can i ask you for tomorrow night shift what Oops, Yasuo got the flu Can't it?

A reconnaissance plane of the Air Self-Defense Force was shot down Unable to confirm whether the pilot escaped I'm afraid the chance of survival is slim Prime Minister should have fully satisfied the conditions now If you don’t make up your mind, this battle will be lost. Prime Minister Prime Minister Japanese territory is being invaded It is already certain that we were attacked by force After the Minister of Defense obtained the consent of all cabinet members Seek the consent of Congress afterwards Now order all the troops of the Self-Defense Force to be deployed Yes Minister of Foreign Affairs, now contact the UN quickly To report that our country will exercise its right of self-defense understood Captain Ibuki gave orders to each ship The defense is dispatched!

Isn't this ship dangerous? It's okay, it's okay, the boat is so big Generally speaking, war and battle are not the same -What's the difference? -Eh Japan has always believed that peace can be maintained even without the use of force Am I going to be the first prime minister to discover that this is just a fantasy Shi Du, how can I bear this responsibility? I will guard the peace and independence of our country Take on the mission of the Self-Defense Force Compliance with the Japanese Constitution and laws Unity and strict discipline Chongde Shangzhi Respect for personality Strengthen fitness, improve skills Not participating in political activities Concentrate on performing duties with a strong sense of responsibility -Don't be afraid of danger-Don't be afraid of danger Dedicate yourself to your mission Live up to the national trust I swear The pilot who fell from the sky above Boriu At the moment of being hit by a missile Must be reciting this vow silently I must avenge the two of them Yuanshang If you go to the battlefield with this kind of thought, you will be blinded Yes We are not going to avenge the enemy If we must use strength to make them understand Their military operations to invade our Asian territorial waters If you are so arrogant, reckless and stupid, tell them with your strength The defense was deployed to prove our strength The deck is 248 meters long There are 720 members serving on this ship In this fighter With 60 barrels of fuel Haven't seen the smoke yet Yes I can't get in touch anymore Is it shut down?

Is this true? Prime Minister, the issue of Iki was posted on the Internet what Hey How could it become like this Deleted let them delete Yes Hold a press conference No Prime Minister... This video will definitely panic the public Will there be a press conference later? Now that it has happened The top priority now is to gain the understanding and support of the people If something goes wrong, the cabinet will be easily dissolved Should we send reinforcements before the reception? If you don’t use the force of the whole army to repel the enemy in one breath We will really lose this war Shiroyama After World War II, a large number of politicians decided the direction of our country Even though there are many discussions and complaints They are united to stick to one thing That is this country, Japan will never go to war This is an agreement with the people I hope you don’t use the word war lightly Chief Cabinet Secretary is preparing to hold a press conference (The Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan is equivalent to the Secretary-General of the Government) Yes What a shocking video I'm glad you showed our work status to the outside world But I didn’t get permission to send the image, which violated the rules I can only keep the satellite phone temporarily By the way, wear your life jacket well Ok 15 seriously injured There was an explosion and fire near the bow of the ship Chuxue shot near the bow Multiple minor injuries (the number is still being confirmed) A report from Chuxue Many people were slightly injured 15 people were seriously injured 2 more people died what You say killed? Who Still confirming Convey Captain Seto Do a good job in the treatment of the crew and repair of the ship Take the seriously injured who can move by helicopter to Okinotori Island Captain Seto was seriously injured and now the deputy captain is in command That's it, then pass it to the deputy captain Yes I buy this for my granddaughter at the nearby convenience store every year She looks forward to this every year Her name is Xiao Shang I was going to wait for the interview to end Just brought it back to her I didn't expect these to be broken Shall you eat it? I'll buy it for my granddaughter Everyone is good friend The world is one home That paragraph is well written As long as you smile, everyone will be happy Everyone is happy because of your smile What's unhappy, let's face it together Dreams will come true as long as there are dreams There are two enemy ships ahead. They are destroyers. Bearing 190 and 45 miles away Driving to Hatsushima This is determined to intercept us If it’s the Northern Fleet of the East Asian Federation, it’s Russa and Sligo. Both ships are equipped with YJ95 anti-ship missiles These two ships must be rendered ineffective -Short-range defense weapon system Check fuel-Understand I think Isokaze should take the lead It’s safer to sink them with the Harpoon anti-ship missile. If you use a harpoon, the ship will sink The two ships together have 600 crew members Do you want to take the lives of all of them In this case, there is no doubt that the enemy will use this as an opportunity to expand the front It would also violate the command of the command "avoid fighting that affects diplomatic negotiations" I blame the reporter for leaking the news and inciting people’s anxiety Since it is the Northern Fleet of East Asia That should also be equipped Long-range missiles that can snipe Japan from the sea Judging from the situation so far, they cannot be judged by common sense International law makes no sense to them If you stimulate them again In case you hurt the nation Then it will trigger the war you call Our Self-Defense Force exists to avoid war Our judgment will be the fuse of the war As a self-defense player Do not As a crew member I can't agree The enemy ship is coming How about Isokaze’s main gun, Deputy Captain? So it won’t sink the enemy ship Main gun Try it Main gun? Be sure to show me when you were a gunner in Pufeng The ability to take first place many times in military competition Don't have to wear a high hat for me I'll do what you want me to do understand Enemy destroyer Speed ​​25 nautical miles 35 miles away The ship’s main gun has a range of 20 miles 5 miles longer than the opponent’s main gun Make good use of this gap Indeed, if the main gun is used Can minimize the damage to enemy ships But the range is only 20 miles, we will also enter the opponent’s radar circle It is very dangerous Didn't the headquarters order the defense to be deployed? Why worry about the enemy... Isn’t your usual training just for today... Don't you want to show it But the enemy will definitely launch anti-ship missiles Ah will come Captain, can I use extended range bombs for shelling?

Breaking news: East Asian Federation forces occupy Hatsushima? The Self-Defense Forces began their first defense deployment The current constitution explains the right to self-defense like this To protect the personal freedom, safety and property of our citizens Allow the use of the minimum necessary force Ah, that's mine give me one Except Mentaiko Can't it?
