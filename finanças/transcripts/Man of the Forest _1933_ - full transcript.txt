What's the matter with you? Sorry, but I don't understand your language. Take it easy while we run the rest of the track. What are you following me for Mike? I want to get a watchdog and throw you out unless you stay closer to my cabin. You know that? Listen, you stay here till I get back. Oh, Jim. - Hi, Brett. I missed you last week. I've been farming around here the last couple of days Thought you'd be coming up. Well, I've been pretty busy. That timber of yours over on funeral range looks pretty good. I'll be sending down for Lumberjacks pretty soon. Good. I'd like to have enough hands. Never saw the lake so high Jim? Yeah. I guess I'd met those Southfork ranches have more water this soon. For devils. And yella got scorched out last summer. I'd like to hope for them. They have troubles enough even when they're irritating. How's the trap been seeing? - Pretty good. I wish I'd have had this trap set yesterday. I might have caught Fred Beasley in it. He was up here snooping around with five or six of his men. What'd he want? - I don't know. Who told one of the boys you'd be up to see you today. I warned him to stay away from this place. He's just trying to start more trouble. He suddenly had your trouble with the visas. You don't think I killed Beasley's brother, do your breath? Doesn't making a difference Jim. Never thought much about it. Well, I didn't. Two Beasley's own men killed his brother. I threatened to do the same thing when I find him stealin my timber. That gave him a chance to pin it on me. With Beasley's hand victory I went to jail. Everybody around here knows that. I'd hate to see Beasley get those Lakes. I had a lot of plans for them. So wonder where those two men are I still appeared. Must be somewheres around here waiting. We haven't started on that new flood great they promised me. I can see why. Come on that should get the headlock. That's it, that's it, Come on beat you. Come on boy. Did they get that mule? They brought it with him. It's a wrestling match. The next world's champion in his manager. He's taunting god big. That's it. Come on give that toehold now in a big. Well I bet none of you. - He hasn't thrown the meal yet. That's it. Wow come on. When you're Sorensen - all just one big. - One whose shoulders? Get around around. They have nothing. Wait, did you know what I talked about? That help. - Uh, yeah. He's sagging found me. Uh, he fouled it. Was a fair throw. It was, it was. - It was not. Well let me know who wins. Jim I got one more trap to set. All right. Well, Guinea in the mood to talk business. I haven't got anything that geez Lee. You're in ten days. - And going to happen. And when it does don't forget what did you mean by ten days. The government's gonna make every ranch here in this section proof title to his property by the first of the month. I'm afraid I ain't gonna be able to do that. On account of that jail term. But you've had all this property for twenty years. I'm afraid that won't make any difference. What do you plan to do, Jim? - I think I've got one way to beat him. I'll turn over whatever rights I have to one of my family. And let them prove before me. Maybe telling you about my niece... Well, Alice gets here tomorrow. She's going to make a home with me. That's great. Say, whines come up and have supper with us? Well, I don't know why... - I've got an idea you change your mind about women. Maybe. I'll have an extra plate sent on for you anyway. The trouble with you is you're afraid of Rodney. He can't hurt you. - Yeah, but I... Why don't you stand your ground and look him in the eye. Well, are you, are you... - Where you going? Hej, we got to... get to work we got work to do. Look him right in the eye. Any port in the storm Mike? Come on we'd better get out of sight. I want to get up my confessions. In the wind pig's ears be here he'll be along. Light a fire. What's Beasley dragon is all the way up here for? I don't know. - Better be something important. I got something important in that floor and when he gets here. Gibble word that were true stalling rival gainer mine too late huh worry me with that he sent for his niece she's getting here tomorrow you know what that means don't you know that what he meant when he said that a lot of things gonna happen an hmm he was step aside firing her name when the land often opens providing she's living on the property yeah I guess that's what he's figuring on doing her
