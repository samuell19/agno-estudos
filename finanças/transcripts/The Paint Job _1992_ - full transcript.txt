Don't you be difficult now. Make yourself ready. MARY: Good night, Henry. I'm warning you, Mary, you're gonna give it to me, or I'm gonna just take it! I ain't gonna do neither, so just forget your big plans, Henry, and go to bed. "With these clothes you'll have no worries." HENRY: This is some bullshit, Mary. "With these clothes you'll have no worries." [DOOR OPENS] What're you doing, boy? What're you doing, boy? I don't think you want the gender I gave you, boy. I was just coloring, sir. You were painting men's bodies, boy, with lipstick! Lipstick! Gonna be like your fucking Momma? Is that it? No! A little pink thing in a little white dress? It ain't gonna happen, boy! [CRIES OUT] You're gonna be like me. You hear that? You're gonna be like your old dad! Henry! Baby. Baby. Come with me, Henry. Come with me. [♪♪♪] [HENRY MOANING] I just can't imagine people painting their walls black. I try to, but I just can't imagine it. Do you know who likes black walls? Who? Devil worshippers. Well, that makes sense. Also drug users and sad people. And burglars. Yeah, but not in their own homes. No, not in their own homes. In their homes they usually like something airy like, aquamarine. Yeah, I could see that. I see you're one short today, Willie. Wesley'll be here a little later, ma'am. Bringing a birthday gift to his Mama. [♪♪♪] Hey, Margaret. Hey. Oh, hey, Wes. Whatcha doing around here? Oh, yeah, I'm just, um... Hey. How you fixed for cosmetics, Margaret? I think I'm pretty set. You selling? Oh, no. Why? Oh. I'm sorry, Wes, what were you saying? Here, Margaret. In case you run out. It's orange pumpkin. [♪♪♪] Lunchtime, boys. How's that Tang drink coming, Mrs. Thack? No, just a few more minutes. WESLEY: How's it going, fellas? CALVIN: Hey, Wes, how's your mama? TOM: What'd you get her? I got her one of those, um, little ladders for the kitchen. I like those little ladders. WILLIE: Oh, shoot. What's the matter, Willie? I forgot my lunch. Uh-oh. Red alert. You better call up your wife, quick, Willie. Mrs. Thack, would it be all right if I used your phone? Afternoon, fellas, Mrs. Thack. That's some lipstick, Margaret. CALVIN: Yeah. Yeah, it looks like Flaming Mango. Mango? Heh. It's too subdued for Mango. More like Tangerine at Dusk. Yeah. Whatta you say, Wes? I don't know. Carrot, maybe. [CHUCKLES] Carrot. Ha! Carrot. That's a real good guess. It's pumpkin. CALVIN: Pumpkin, of course. TOM: I was thinking, yam, maybe. CALVIN: Yam? That's about as dumb as carrot. TOM: Yam is no way as dumb as carrot. CALVIN: Do you wanna put some money on that? TOM: Ten bucks. CALVIN: Well. Why don't we make it five? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Order up. Pick the order up. What? Come on, Willie, just throw her some excuse. Man, you gotta see what these city people do for fun. Two weeks ago, I went to a parade. Saw someone dressed up as a great big dick. Round six feet high. No, it was taller than that. No, no, it was not. They got a skate boarding ventriloquist in the park. Now when's the last time you saw one of those? I never seen one before. There you go then. And last week? A Jeep Cherokee rammed right into a department store. You know that sounds good and all, but... And don't forget that waitresses. Some of them are so good looking I'm ordering food I don't eat. Lot of them'll date total strangers too. Well, heh. I can't be doing that. Oh, come on, Willie. Margaret ain't gonna know, you know? She might even think more of you, if you did run off every now and again, like the other boys. What do you mean by that, Wesley? Mean by what? That she might think more of me. Did Margaret say something to you? No, of course not. Did you say something to her? No. I work hard at my marriage, Wesley. No, I know. It might look like, uh... I don't know. You know, somehow I got what I want. Not gonna see me tossing my marriage up in the air just to see where it lands now. He-he didn't mean nothing, Willie. He just wanted you to join the fun. Yeah, well. I'm sorry, boys, but I'm gonna go home. You, have fun with your ventriloquist and all. Shit, Wesley, you sure stepped on a big toe that time. Didn't even finish his ribs. I think I'm gonna pass on tonight. Aw, come on. What you gonna do around here? [PEOPLE LAUGHING, CHATTERING LOUDLY] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING NEARBY] WILLIE: This popcorn taste all right to you? It's a little too buttery. Too buttery. I thought there wasn't enough butter. Yes, but I don't really like butter on my popcorn. That's not true, Margaret. Right from the start you've always been a big fan of butter. I think, Willie, you're, well... mistaking me for someone else in this room. Well... that's what happens, you know, when you... when you become a real couple you... [CHUCKLES] You sort of turn into a one big two-headed person. But a two-headed person is a kind of freak, Willie. I think I'm gonna go out for a while Margaret. What about the TV show? Uh... I-I saw this one. That boy dies. MAN [ON TV]: You see, I didn't do anything. I don't know why you guys are even here. [SIREN APPROACHING] [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [GLASS SHATTERS IN HOUSE] [GASPS] I got it bad, Margaret. What do you mean, Wesley? I got some ideas I don't know what to do with. You're not crazy are you, Wesley? I don't know, Margaret. I mean, look where I am here. Heh. And look what I'm doing. Uh-- And what are-- What are you doing? I just broke into your house, Margaret. I ain't never broken into no house before. And why did you break in? I had to get to you, Margaret. [STAMMERS] But I never done anything to you, Wesley. I don't see your point, Margaret. Now, Wesley, I'm very sorry that you're such a psycho, but I ain't gonna let you stab me. I don't care how bad you need to do it. I ain't gonna let you. Oh... I wasn't gonna-- I would never. I would stab myself before I'd ever... Oh... Uh... You see? I'd do it to myself before I'd ever hurt you, Margaret. Oh, don't, Wesley. You see... how much I care for you, Margaret. [DOORBELL RINGING] ALFRED: Margaret? Willie? It's Alfred. I need to ask you about them people across the street. You gotta go. Just let me see you, Margaret. [DOORBELL RINGING] I'll call you tomorrow. You will? Are you sure? In the afternoon. [♪♪♪] [DOORBELL RINGING] Oh. Uh-- One second, Alfred. ALEX [ON TV]: Charlie, how did you meet? CHARLIE: Well, I don't really remember. See, I wasn't rehabilitated yet. CAROL: I think maybe it was at a bus stop. CHARLIE: But I'll tell you this, Alex, it was love at first sight. ALEX: Oh, that's wonderful. Margaret? ALEX: How long have you been married? CHARLIE: Oh, I'd say probably 35 years. Margaret... ALEX: You're not sure? CAROL: Well, you see, Alex... Margaret, what happened to this shirt? Oh, I dropped it in the roasting pan. No, I was talking to Willie. ALEX: But you two are very happy now, right? CHARLIE: Yeah, in a manner of speaking. ALEX: That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Now, remember, I just want a trim. Just a little off the sides and even off the back a little, and that'll be fine. Sound a little nervous, Wesley. That's 'cause I just want a trim. I know, but a trim can mean a lotta things. How about a littletrim then? [CHUCKLES] Sounds like you got a little extra riding on this haircut. But I've got something now that I think will prevent any misunderstanding. For another dollar, I will rent you one of these buzzers... and as soon as you think I'm going a little too far, you hit that buzzer and I freeze, right there. [CHUCKLES] Huh? I'll take it. See, this is all part of our expanded service. Hm. So, uh, who's this hot date, do I know her? [BUZZING] Something the matter? No. Don't get trigger happy on me, Wesley. Hey, there you are. CALVIN: Had Willie talk to you? Willie? No. We're all gonna meet up with him in the city later. I thought you went in last night? No, we ended up staying home and playing Risk. Well, no, I don't think I can go. [SCOFFS] Come on, why not? He got himself a date. If you can believe that. Date? With who? [BUZZING] Don't take too much off the back there, Mr. Emilio. Come on, who you seeing? I ain't seeing anyone. Mr. Emilio here he just pulling... That's swell, Mr. Emilio. Yeah. You boys have a good time tonight. Jesus, Wes. Something happen last night? Oh, nah, nah, I just cut myself eating. WILLIE [CHUCKLES]: Easy, Dave. I have a whole other steak in the bag. I don't want no other steak. How about some more milk? No. Dave, come on, just a little. Oh, Dave. Get that away from me! All right, I'm finished. You feel better? No! You gotta remember: eat regularly. I'm done now. Just gimme what you promised. All right. All right. There ain't no bottle in there. Just open it. Open it up. Go right ahead. Matching pants and vest. Permanent press. Go on, try 'em on. Come on, mister, just gimme what you promised. Look. Give me it already and then we'll... WOMAN [MOANING]: No, no. Oh, no. No. Oh, no. Oh, no. I hate-- I hate when people act like that. [PANTING AND MOANING] Hey, Margaret... What, Wes? I was just wondering. Hmm? Are you, uh, happily married? Huh? [♪♪♪] Well, are you? H-happily married? Yeah. Are you happy being married? Oh... You mean to Willie? Yeah. I'm not sure. When do you think you'll know? I don't know. I may never know. Yeah. Well, I know. This may seem a little premature, but I don't ever wanna leave you for as long as I live. Oh... Well, that's nice. I mean, I don't mean to brag or nothing, but when I get something into my head, it don't leave me for 50 or maybe even 60 years. What do you think he's doing? CALVIN: He's reshaping his head. Is that it? That's why most people do it. You mean his head's one of them bumpy ones. That or it's lopsided. See, I thought maybe he was a lunatic or something. Yeah, that would explain it too. Did you ever notice that-- How most people don't make sense, till you realize they're lunatics? I have. I have noticed that. Hi. Damn, I was enjoying that egg roll. [LAUGHING] I'll buy you another one. Will you look at that? TOM: I told you this town was great. WILLIE: What's he doing? Right now? Yeah. He's being indecipherable. Uh-huh. You wanna hit? Yeah. Do you want to start this off? No, go ahead. Hey, uh, how'd that meeting go? Are we gonna be doing some city painting? No, the fella was just playing with me. One thing I object to about people. They just ain't who they are. Say, where's Wesley? Didn't want to come. Why is that? He's got some big secret date, if you can believe that. [♪♪♪] So how'd that date of yours go, Wesley? Which date is that, Willie? I heard you had some big date Saturday night. Not me. Are you sure, now, 'cause, uh... [CHUCKLES] I was told... You should know better than to take Tom and Cal seriously. Why I didn't hear it from Tom and Cal. What? You been talking to Mr. Emilio? No, no, as a matter of fact, Margaret told me. Yeah, she said she saw you and this dark-haired girl cuddling. In your truck outside 7-Eleven. Think he's got you now, Wesley. I'm sorry, Willie, I think your wife must be mistaken. Oh. Heh. Why is that, Wesley? The fact is, I couldn't have gone out Saturday night even though I wanted to. MARGARET: Hello. WILLIE: We're in the hallway, Margaret. MARGARET: Hi, Mrs. Thack. Yes or no. Wasn't Wesley cuddling up with some woman Saturday night? I don't know. WILLIE: You don't know? [WILLIE SCOFFS] Wait, you said that you saw Wesley and this woman and they were holding onto each other so tight that you couldn't tell which one was the hot dog and which one was the bun. I never said that, Willie. I never said anything at all like that. [WILLIE SCOFFS] You didn't? Are you sure? I think Willie's playing with you. Yeah, I think so too. THACK: Oh, wait now, I'm all confused. You didn't have no date Saturday night? No, I didn't have no date Saturday night. Oh, I baked each of you your own small pie. You, too, Mrs. Thack. And to be fair, made your pie a little bigger than the others, Willie. Is this my favorite? Go look. THACK: Thank you, dear. You enjoy it. Hey, thank you, Margaret. My pleasure. Tom? Cal? Hot damn. Mincemeat. You got yourself one big-hearted woman, Willie. What kind did you get, Wesley? Oh, looks like cherry pie from here. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [RINGING] Hello. You're for real now, right? Yeah. I'm real, Margaret. I'm totally real. I mean, you're not taking me on some sort of a sexual joyride, right? No, this ain't no joyride. This is a serious drive. Are you absolutely sure, Wesley? Because if you're not absolutely sure... I'm sure, Margaret. 'Cause we could be in for a bad fall. You know that, right? Willie's already acting very peculiar. If that is part of it, then that is part of it. So... When do I get to see you again, Margaret? Willie's gonna meet up again with the boys in the city this Friday. Hey, Margaret. I, uh, I just wanna know... I gotta go now, Wesley. I just wanna... thank you, Margaret. I'll see you on Friday. You have a nice weekend now. What time we all gonna meet up? Uh, you know, fellas, I-I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it tonight. Come on, Willie, you already took a vow. I know, but, somehow I promised Margaret I'd take her dancing. [SCOFFS] Willie, you don't wanna go dancing tonight. Trust me, Willie, you go out on that dance floor and by the time we're ready to leave... What?Well-- Be a lotta people holding grudges. You can always go dancing tomorrow night. Yeah. That's right. I'm sorry. I gotta make my wife happy. Damn. You're still goin' right, Wesley? Sure. It's gonna be fun, right? Lot more fun than dancing, that's for sure. Hey, you got the keys? Let me drive. Come on, let me drive. [♪♪♪] Well, what do you think? You look real nice. You gonna try and wait up for me? If I can. You have a good time. Yeah. You too. [PHONE RINGING] [LINE TRILLING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] CALVIN: I gotta hand it to these city folks. They can make a little go a long way. They got bigger imaginations. Have you boys... What? You boys ever been in love? Whatta you mean, sincerely? Yeah. Not really, no. Myself, I can only go in for it maybe once every four, five years. You know, body couldn't take any more than that. It's hard on the system. Upper chest, intestinal area. Don't forget the back of the neck. TOM: What about you? I'm going through it. Yeah. But why? I don't know. Whew. Just snuck up on you, didn't it? Just sunk it's teeth in you like some damn shit-head. Yeah, I guess so. [PEOPLE CLAPPING, CHEERING] See, that's it. You let your guard down for a second. The thing is in, in your door, puts it's hot tongue in your ear and you can kiss goodbye bare minimum a year of your life. What are you talking about? He fell in love, right? Right. Yeah, so? I'll be right back. I got myself in a real no-win situation. Do you wanna get out of it? I don't know if I can. Sure you can. You just gotta follow the procedure. First thing you do, burn everything. Letters, gifts, photos. And if it doesn't burn get a hold of a ball-peen hammer. And then, you go to the movies. But you only see things with the word dead or blood in the title. Then when you get out of the movies, you build something intricate. Maybe a geodesic dome. And whatever you do, never, ever... turn the TV off. Come on, you gotta see this. Come on. You gotta see the shape of this thing. Come on. You coming? No. Thank you Let me see that for second. [♪♪♪] You read his shit? [PAPER THWACKS] WILLIE: Stand up straight, son. That's right. Real straight now. How does that feel? Does that feel good? No? You don't-- You don't like this? Lemme cheer you up. Lemme put a smile on your old face, all right, son? Now don't-don't you move. Don't you move. [RHYTHMIC BANGING] Hey, Margaret? What do you think? Do you think you got me on a-a hook? No. Think you got yourself some... [SOFTLY] Do you think you got yourself, some love slave? Someone who goes to bed at night, just dreaming about your belt buckle? I never said that. Two things you better understand. One, I do not have the time to ruin my life for nothing anymore. And two, I do not get deserted by people I hardly know. I wouldn't desert you, Margaret. Why, we ain't even got to that point yet. We had a meeting planned last night, Wesley. Yeah, but Willie told me that he was taking you dancing. Oh, you, Willie has never moved his feet to music in his entire life. We did not dance at our own wedding, and you know that! Well, yeah, I do know that. Yeah. But... I am gettin' in my car now! Would you just wait a minute. Just listen, Margaret. You see, I wound up following Willie last night and he's a bona fide lunatic, Margaret. What is that supposed to mean? I don't know yet, but... Do you know what I think, Wesley? I think that you, you are a lunatic. You have not done, you have not said one thing that... I'm surprised I haven't found you walking an imaginary dog 'round a waste paper basket. Because... you know, Wesley, you are, are a cracked cup. Yes, that's right, you are a cracked cup. [CAR PULLS AWAY] Why are you doing this anyway? WILLIE: I don't like my looks anymore. Since when? I ain't been happy with 'em for a while now. That's bad. Man looks in the mirror, he should feel encouraged. [TAPPING] [RINGING] Hello. WESLEY: Margaret? I do not wish to speak to you. [RINGING] Please leave me alone. Just one second now. You just gotta listen to me, Margaret, I would never... WILLIE: What's the matter? [RECEIVER CLATTERS] Uh-- Kids. P-prank calls. Were they obscene?Yeah. Uh... A little. Yeah. Oh... Willie, why you got that wig? Oh. Heh. I thought maybe my head could use a little change of scenery. [PHONE RINGING] Listen, you kids call here again and I'll... You don't-- You don't call here. [LINE CLICKS] [DIALTONE HUMS] I appreciate your hearing me out this late at night. I don't normally bother people with my confusions. But I was hoping maybe you could answer me this... why would a woman that you were wild about and, oh, very serious about. Why would this woman love you one second... and then you know... run off screaming the next? Hmm... Maybe... Yeah? She, uh... had a change of heart. Yeah, well, of course, but why? Maybe she felt like she stepped into some quicksand. If she didn't pull out her foot right then and there she'd sink deeper and deeper, until that quicksand filled up her mouth and drowned her. Do you think I'm a pool of quicksand? Well... You do have light colored hair. KENNY: Hey, uh, Jimmy, listen, why don't you and the rest of your crack-smoking buddies just wrap your lips around an exhaust pipe of a car and take a good long toke on that, all right? Hello, you're on the air. WESLEY [OVER PHONE]: Hello. Kenny? Yeah, what can I do for you? Is this Kenny? Yeah. Uh, my name is Clark, Kenny, and, uh, I have this problem. You sound like you have a problem, Clark. Yes, Well, I do, Kenny. You see, I know this person and he's a little on the perverted side. On the perverted side? Yeah. And are you on the perverted side, Clark? Oh, no, no. You see, that's just it, see, this person is a person that I just wanna I just, drown him outta my life. Just once and for all. Just-just get him out. Oh, you're a fascist vigilante, aren't you, Clark? No. The thing is that some Black couple or some Vietnamese couple wants to move in on your block and you just can't deal with that, right? No. No. Come on, admit it. Clark, come on, admit it. You're one of these guys who wants to build a 15-foot high wall all along the Mexican border with machine gun turrets every 50 feet and a solid line of pitbulls in front of that. Isn't that what you'd really like to do, if you could? If you weren't so afraid? If you weren't such a frightened cowardly little piece of shit, Clark? [♪♪♪] CALVIN: Did you see Willie this weekend? No. Why? He went off the deep end this time. How so? Wigged his hair all white. Sorta resembles Peter Graves. Looks more like Lorne Green than Peter Graves. CALVIN: Lorne Green? It's looks more like Brian Keith than Lorne Green. Damn. You all right there, Wes? Yeah, sure. He's still lovesick. Just from the look in his eyes. He's like he's been up all night crying some woman's name. You know, Tom, you better learn that when I-- Good morning, fellas. Who do you think you look more like in that wig? Lorne Green or Peter Graves? Or Brian Keith? You know, what about Tip O'Neil? No, no, no, Pat Summerall? Brian Keith. Listen fellas, we gotta get going. We got two days to finish this job up.

Think that they're like your best friend... but they can be anything but. Yeah. Come on, now, Willie. It's not like I got a lot to go on, you know... but I tell you this...

I am gonna go right up to Willie and I'm gonna tell him everything. And if I do that... Well... You won't be painting around here for a long time to come. [SCOFFS] Now, don't get the wrong idea, Margaret. What are you doing? You see, this is the kind of thing that when you look back on it, you're gonna be glad it happened. Keep your distance! Just try and relax, Margaret. Wesley, if you have any feelings for me at all, you will put that pillow back on that chair and sit on it. I know it appears otherwise, Margaret, but this here is a sign of true affection. Wesley, I-- ANNOUNCER: And now turning to the local news. Today, Police Commissioner Gilman met with the press to discuss developments in the investigation of the so-called "Lipstick Murders."

Anyone having any information regarding the whereabouts of someone fitting this description should... WESLEY: I got some books around here. Do you like medieval romances? Here's a store flyer. It's a little dated, but, uh... I know. How about a cookbook? It's just a plain sort of a cookbook. It's just nothing fancy, but you know, if you follow the directions you can usually come up with something that's pretty edible. Here's something. It's called carrot surprise. Don't you worry, Margaret, everything's gonna be put right. Now, as soon as I get back, we can-- I mean, you and I... we're gonna be able to, uh... [GRUNTS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR CLOSES] Where you been? Nowhere. I guess I overslept. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, don't take no offense, Wes, but this is about as bad as I've ever seen you look. No, it isn't... Hey, fellas, why don't you finish up back here. I think me and Wesley gonna head on over to old man Clark's. All right. How's that? I thought that, uh, you and I would head over to old man Clark's and get started, if that's all right. Fine. Yeah, this is gonna be a good job. Is it? Yeah. Best one yet. Things are finally coming together. Ever get that feeling, Wesley? All the pieces finally fit? No, I never have, Willie. You will. You will. Hey, see that house? WESLEY: Yeah. That's where Happy Joe killed his family. Oh, yeah? Yeah, tied 'em up, had some breakfast... got up and blew off their heads. Why'd he do it? [LAUGHS] Why? Yeah. Joe have some reason... for murdering all of them? Yeah. Probably. You know, sometimes just... being alive is reason enough. [♪♪♪] MARGARET: Willie? Willie? You're a little late, Margaret. What do you mean? Willie and Wesley are at old man Clark's. [GASPS] Is there anyone here? Just you and me. Well... How we gonna do it? Well... Thought I'd start you off upstairs in the back room. You don't mind the back rooms, do you? No. I sort of like them. Well, I'll see you later. [♪♪♪] [WHISTLING] [CLATTERING] [DOOR BANGS OPEN] Got a moment, Wesley? I think there's a few things we need to iron out. Like... Like what, Willie? I don't know. I don't feel like we've been communicating as directly as we used to. What's that for, Wesley? I ain't no old drunk, Willie. Oh, I know that. [CHUCKLES] Hell, son, if you were... Margaret wouldn't have anything to do with you now, would she? What's the matter, Wesley... you feeling guilty? Be with you in a second, Wesley. Just hold on there. No. Doing this because I love you, son. [GASPS] Margaret, can I talk to you for a second? I think-- I think I better go. I think there's something we really need to discuss. Remember our last talk about how we should start over, start fresh? Well, I don't think we should. All right, that's all right. Now, because you see, I don't really forgive you, Margaret. Now, I know I said I did, see, but I don't. In fact, I've never forgiven anybody anything. It's true. You know, I don't want you to think that I don't love you. Because I do love you. Everything's all right now, Margaret. Everything's fine. [WHIMPERING] [♪♪♪] TOM: No. Don't wake him. CALVIN: How you doing, Wesley? Hey. [OVER PA] Cardiology... We brought you these. We gave the saltines to Margaret. Figured you'd like these better. Margaret? Yeah, she's down the hall in the nicer wing. Is she all right, Cal? Well... You know, uh, Willie did land on her. It's hard to believe Willie doing what he did. Did he ever tell you why? No. I always thought serial killers were supposed to be... you know, bachelors with part-time jobs. Maybe half of them are bachelors, if that. Cal, it ain't what the figures say... yo, hold it, hold it. Hold it. Where you going? I'll be all right. I'll just you boys break open those chips and I'll be right back. [♪♪♪] Heya, Margaret. You doing all right? I'm a little sore, that's all. You're not sore at me, are you? No, I'm... You're overcome with feeling, is that it? No, that's not-- When you and Willie... I thought you were gonna kill each other. Oh, well, I know it looked like that, but we didn't. No, I mean, I wished you had killed each other. Oh, sure, the heat of the moment and all that... Well, sure. Did you hear what I said? I'm right here, Margaret.
