Is Magic Swordsman Qi Rufeng home? I'm Qi Rufeng. Please state your purpose Are you Qi the Master Swordsman? You are too kind I have a letter for you... from brigand chiefs, Ma and Xu, of Huainan Poisonous incense! Qi Rufeng, you didn't expect that, right? You people are such rats! This is for meddling in our affairs Today we will make you regret If I were you, I'd step aside The master has been poisoned Take him in and give him some medicine Yes Uncle... Open the door... Open up, uncle Coming... Uncle... Open up Uncle... Open up, come on. What is it? What happened? What's the matter? My father is fighting with some thieves Fang Cheng Fang Cheng Master, you've raised me... and taught me martial arts since I was little It's my honor to die for you But... But, my son is still young... Father... Don't worry, Fang Cheng I'll take your son under my wing You mean... I'll make him my disciple and treat him like one of my nephews Come lad, thank the master Master I'm your teacher now I'm grateful, master Father...! Don't you feel cold? I'm chopping firewood Please don't touch me. I'm sweating all over Why are you chopping firewood? You aren't one of the servants here Miss, you told me to chop firewood Well, now I'm asking you to stop Come, practise the sword with me I have already practised I know, but practice with me again Go get your sword. Miss, I'd rather you carried on... with the other two brothers, or they'll detest me. Why do you always address me as "Miss"... but not by my first name? He doesn't deserve it. Just let him be Pei-er, I'll practise swords with you It's none of your business. Fang Gang His father was a mere servant He's only good for chopping firewood It's his ploy to win our teacher's love; so that our teacher will scold you... for treating him like a servant Stop there... I'm older than you It's my job to supervise you... understand? Teacher never said anything like that You refuse to obey me then? We should obey senior disciples... when the teacher is out. How dare you? As an older disciple, you should treat all brothers fairly and love them all I actually don't like you fawning on Pei-er while bullying other brothers Father Teacher You're back Teacher You again asked Ah Gang to do the chores? I... No, I'm doing it of my own will Pei-er and Sun Hao supervise me practicing Why don't you wear the new clothes? I'm afraid they'll get dirty Go change your clothes and then practice Yes Pei-er, you're not a child now Be more considerate The world doesn't revolve around you - It wasn't Peier's... - Shut up You think I don't know your behavior Your rich father sent you here... because he knows I'll discipline you Sun Hao, what did you do just now? I... Your father is the famous Swordsman Hebei He could teach you martial arts himself Why did he send you here? Your father didn't want to spoil you. Don't you ever think I'll be lenient with you... because your father was my best pal On the contrary, I'll be extra demanding... so as not to let my friend down You're my disciples I'll teach you martial arts and you'll learn to be righteous men I won'tjust let you be He just favors Fang Gang. That's all Fang Gang is cunning He poses as a nice guy... in front of our teacher We get rebuked every time because of him He even dared to fight back today! I swear I'll fix him I've an idea. Our teacher is home now We have to be patient and wait until mid-night Then we ask him to meet us at the woods and punish him Great idea He can only fool our teacher. He... You pretend to be nice in front of teacher to please him You don't respect your elder brothers and Peier Meet us in the woods at mid-night You must come. Be there... if you still have courage Whoever reports this to our teacher... is a brazen rat Okay It's late. Return to your room You think it over carefully Rufeng, Pei-er is our only child Don't be too harsh on her Fang Gang is no doubt a good lad; but he's too stubborn sometimes Peier is right. He's arrogant sometimes True, Fang Cheng died for our family but we've raised his only child and never one day has he been starved You've spoiled Pei-er Actually, I have my own plan It isn't because he's Fang Cheng's son Do you know why I went out today? Why? I heard Smiling Tiger Cheng Tianshou... is in the neighborhood I'm afraid he's up to no good So I checked around There isn't anyone suspicious though I've helped a lot of people in my life but also made many foes. I'm concerned about Smiling Tiger's older brother Long-armed Devil I'll be 55 next year I've informed all my disciples... to gather here on my birthday I'm going to choose a successor amongst them Then I'll withdraw from the martial-arts world I have only one daughter... who is unfortunately spoiled and far less skilled than me; nor good enough to be my successor I've many disciples but none of them talented enough... to learn all my skills and swordsmanship I consider Ah Gang to be quite capable I wish him to be my successor... as well as my son-in... You want Peier to marry him? I'm afraid... Judge by what happened today... Our teacher is strange He favors a servant's son I don't like the idea of... treating a servant's son as brother Teacher, you've been most kind to me But I fear that my staying here will only... make things difficult for you. I must leave I hope I can repay your kindness someday Teacher... Brother Sun... Fang Gang has left Let's go Rufeng, where're you going? It's late Pull out your sword I'm here to clear things up with you and say good bye I'm not fighting with you Say goodbye? I know you don't like me My staying will only hurt everyone's feeling Therefore I've decided to leave You betray our teacher? We can't let him go just like that Let's punish this traitor, on behalf of our teacher Brother Sun, don't force me... to fight back Brother Sun Our teacher is famous for his swordsmanship You will only disgrace him... with such paltry skills You had the chance to learn from Teacher Qi I urge you to do your best Stop there. You think you're the only one... who has learnt all my father's expertise Teacher Qi brought me up I won't fight with you, Miss Don't call me "Miss" Your father died for the sake of mine Why would you leave without saying goodbye... if you're that grateful to my father? I won't let you go... if you don't fight with me Let's fight with bare hands if you insist I don't want to hurt you even by mistake It's too dangerous You're afraid of my father's swordsmanship? We both learned our skill... from your father Okay, let's fight with bare hands Miss, I'm sorry. You... you hurt me I told you not to fight Qi Pei-er, you... Pei-er, you acted so quickly Pei-er, don't worry. You cut off his arm, so what? He won't come back anyway Don't bring this up in front of our teacher Teacher is coming Teacher... Father! I just knew you were here. Where's Ah Gang? How dare you kill Ah Gang? No, we didn't... What's this? It was all his fault He dared to fight with Pei-er Pei-erjust cut off his arm in the fight You're lying; the three of you together... are not his match Tell me the truth or await the punishment Father, I forced him to fight with me He defeated me with bare hands I pulled out my sword and cut off his arm Where's Ah Gang? He left Come along and help me look for him You'll be responsible for him Grandpa Wang Grandpa Wang Xiaoman, what can I do for you? Grandpa, there's a man bleeding in my boat Who is it? He's a stranger He has suffered serious injuries His arm has been cut off Please save him Ah Shun Help move the injured man from the boat Bring me a pillow. I'll prepare some medicine Hey, you're up! We were worried to death Who are you? Where am I? My name is Xiaoman. This is my home You've been unconscious for 7 days My right arm... What am I going to do without my right arm? My sword... where's my sword? Here No, not this one Then... is it this one? But it's broken! Father, you were a servant your entire life You died for your master I just wanted you to be proud of me but I'm getting nowhere now I am maimed Miss Xiaoman, didn't mean to scare you You didn't You haven't fully recovered. Don't move Thank you for saving my life I just lost my control. I'm sorry Please don't be scared I understand it must be hard for you Where is your family? I'm an orphan You took care of me for 7 days... when I was unconscious? Please lie down. I've cooked some porridge Let me get you some Xiaoman... Come here Look, I can fish I can fish with my left hand Great. It's a big fish But I can't manage a lot with my left hand You can learn how to use it You work so hard I don't want to burden you Don't say that. You've just recovered You're still weak I know you feel sad because you can't practise ...martial arts without your right arm Well, where has martial arts got you so far? If your teacher wasn't a swordsman... your father wouldn't be killed by his enemies If not for martial arts... your arm wouldn't be cut off I've practiced martial arts... since childhood I know nothing besides that I could be a bodyguard... if my arm wasn't cut off Or I could teach martial arts What can I do now? You're still a robust young man You may not be a swordsman but you can learn to farm and fish depending on your commitment Mother left me this house and the field It's not big, but it's good enough If you decide to lead an ordinary life... we can farm, fish and weave... to support ourselves Xiaoman, you've been nice to me How come you have never told me... your last name? It's not like that The truth is I don't know it either Look Didn't expect to see a pretty girl... in this small village It's a pity! She's with a cripple with only one arm Ah Gang, don't pay attention to them Hey girl, he can't hug you... with his only arm Mind what you say Come home with us We can hug you much better than the cripple Ah Gang Let him go Come and fight Stop it Teacher Master Cheng Miss Xiaoman, I'm sorry These two idiots behaved outrageously I'll punish them. Please forgive them Get out of here Sorry... Goodbye Ah Gang Leave me alone I... I'm a good-for-nothing... Don't you dare stir up trouble My older brother told me to watch out for Qi Rufeng Tonight He's going to teach you some skills... which can restrain Qi's sword If you spoil my brother's plan... you know his temper Ah Gang You haven't slept yet? You've seen everything I didn't want you to practise martial arts... but it breaks my heart to see your sorrow You may find it useful Xiaoman, where did you get this? It's a long story. I told you earlier... that I don't know my last name All I remember is one night when I was little my father came home bleeding all over I was scared and cried Hide this book in a safe place When Xiaoman grows up... Father... It's all due to this... Heartbroken, Mom threw it into the fire When she regretted and picked it up again... the book was burned down to less than half Mother brought me here after that She bought the field, built this house... Two years later, she passed away She didn't tell me what my last name is nor my father's name She said reprisal only breeds reprisal Besides, most contents of the book... were burnt away On the left hand side is just what remains I keep it in memory of my parents I thought even if I know who I am I may not be able to get revenge On the contrary I might be killed, if my enemy finds out about me So I decided to lead my life farming You happened to lose your right arm but this might be useful for left-hand training I know nothing about it anyway. It's yours Uncle Stand up Ding Peng, Ba Shuang... Yes Explain it to them Yes You learned how to fight with one sword? Yes Brother Ba This is Qi's golden sword All Qi's disciples... have a sword like this one We got this from... Qi's disciple that we killed It's 3 and a half feet with a thin blade Study it carefully You use this sword and fight with me Do your best I will Come on If you were Qi's disciple... you would be dead now Our teacher fought with Qi for 2 days He memorized all his moves There are 64 moves in total Our teacher created this sword lock, which has 64 tactics too The lock is purposely designed... to lock Qi's sword The size and design are just perfect We'll surely defeat Qi Rufeng... with this sword lock I understand the concept now But I still have to learn... how to use it from you, brother You two must work hard and don't let your uncle down Yes You practise the moves with your brothers Do not show it to anyone We want to take Qi by surprise You mustn't leave the house with the lock Or you know how we'll punish you I wouldn't dare Brother Brother Anything special over Qi Rufeng's side? The fifth day of July... is Qi Rufeng's fifty-fifth birthday He has invited all his disciples to a party Reportedly, he's going to choose his successor and withdraw from the martial arts world Great. We'll seize the oppotnity... to destroy them thoroughly Qi Rufeng has many disciples There's not enough of us to eliminate them all We can't let someone slip through... lest he come for revenge some day Tonight, we'll teach you all 64 moves of my sword lock You practise it with Guo Sheng and Qin Dachuan Tomorrow morning, Ding Peng and Ba Shuang... will come with me to ambush Qi's disciples Stand up Who're you? Don't you know me? Tell me your name and be killed So you're that Long-armed Devil I'm Pei Xun, Qi Rufeng's ninth disciple My teacher defeated you once Now, along with your disciples... you're here to ambush me You're not my match I'll challenge your teacher Ding Peng, Ba Shuang... Yes My disciples will fight with you Fair enough? Stop... You mind leaving this tree alone? If you keep practicing a few more days... You'll tear down my house... My palm technique is almost perfect but I still have to practise my swordsmanship Where's the book? In the house The sword is auxiliary so it should be shorter My sword is too long It doesn't go with the moves I got it Teacher, it's a bit dull... to try this on a dummy Why don't you let us go out... You can't leave the house with the sword lock Did you forget your uncle's words? No Keep practising, I'll return to my room I am bored to death I hear there'll be a temple fair tomorrow Let's get out of here and check it out We just have to leave the sword lock here Good You haven't slept yet? The broken sword is just perfect I've learnt something new as well I don't understand why are you so happy? What's so good about martial arts? I could protect you like the other day and no one can hurt me It'll bring troubles with it too If my father didn't learn martial arts he'd not inherit this book from his teacher and wouldn't eventually die for it My Mom and I wouldn't have suffered When you learn everything in the book... you will leave me and lead a swordsman's life No, I won't leave you I know you're good to me You just say that. Who knows! That's a promise I'll only use it to protect us and won't mind other peoples' business Can't you see it? Pei-er actually likes Fang Gang Shut up. Thinking back... we shouldn't have treated Fang like that Let's go Pei-er, cheer up There is a temple fair today Let's check it out, shall we? Look, over there Have you been to a temple fair before? No, I've been busy practising swords We never thought of going to one Grandpa Wang, Shun Has the young fellow recovered? Yes, thanks for treating him Let me introduce, Grandpa Wang and Shun They saved your life Thank you Don't mention it. So long Look at those two kids Aren't they cute? Masks galore Look Masks. Buy one for two cents Come on, masks for sale Good... He took my mask I'll buy you another one Hi kid, come here... one for two cents, come on You're too old to rob from a child Shame on you Those three who just passed by... were my brothers and Pei-er I don't wish to be seen Come on... Hi girl, don't you like it? How can you do this? I do what I like. Can you stop me? It's Buddha's birthday How dare you molest the girl! Buddha's birthday or not. Damn you Don't fight Let go Don't fight... Damn Don't fight... They practise martial arts. Don't fight with them You're not their match Come on, put down your stake... We are not their match. Please help me... bring Shun home Alright... Grandpa Wang, what happened to Shun? Master Cheng's disciples teased Mrs Zhang Shun told them to behave themselves and was beaten by them Ah Gang Grandpa and Shun saved my life once It's not meddlilng in others' business It's my chance... It's you, the maimed, again? The pretty girl is here too You can't take care of her and want us to help? Mind what you say Why did you beat Shun? You're at our mercy too so mind your own business. Come on, girl They deserve it Stop You stirred up trouble again. Go home now You did a good job... Wait... Let me treat you to some tea We're in Qi's neighborhood. Don't cause trouble or your uncle will kill you Teacher, look Pei-er, let's go over there Teacher, I believe... they're Qi's disciples Who could that girl be? Qi has a daughter. I bet it's her Let's try the sword lock on her But we haven't brought it with us We can't try it here anyway Let's kidnap her Let's go over there Miss Qi How do you know my name? Your father is the famous Magic Swordsman I see your golden sword. I hear Swordsman Qi passes on all his skills to his only daughter That would be you, I bet May I ask your name? I've heard a lot about you and your father I have some important information to tell you I live nearby, would you kindly come with me? Let me tell you everything Why not Pei-er, we don't know him Nothing to be afraid of. I can see he's nice Besides, he has something to tell me You beat those two rascals They deserve it... I believe they'd have some ulterior motive It's not our business She cut off your arm so couldn't count as your saviour, right? Please have a seat over there, young men Take a seat, Miss Qi Your tea What have you done to Pei-er? Don't worry I just made her fall asleep We won't kill her We just have a toy we don't want her to see so we made her slumber off a while What toy is that? This is it Then why're you showing it to us? We're going to try this on you How can we keep it from you? But don't worry You have no chance to talk about it Now that we've fallen into your trap Just show us your toy Wait a minute This must be some martial-arts master May I ask your name? I'm Cheng Tianshou, nicknamed Smiling Tiger I've heard your name before You should square accounts with our teacher but not us. I'm afraid... It's no use Of course I won't fight with you My disciples will It would be one-on-one fight Is it fair? Come on But... Brother, don't talk to him Let's fight with them Who's first? Me Brother Brother, death before dishonor Teacher, what about Qi Rufeng's daughter... We surely will beat Qi Rufeng with our secret weapon the sword lock But it wouldn't be wrong to be careful We keep her as our hostage I see you're worried about that Pei-er She treated me badly but she is my teacher's only child Ssh, I'm here to rescue you What if our teacher finds out? She'll still be our hostage after we do this to her Miss Qi, we're here to... keep you company If you do what we tell you to... we'll get you out of the cellar It's you again Why are you wearing a mask? Who wouldn't recognize you're the maimed? I let you go earlier I won't spare you this time You bully me because I'm maimed Now you know what it feels like! You jump up first Fang Gang, I cut off your arm Why did you rescue me? You recognize me I'm familiar with your voice Besides, you have only one arm Guess there aren't too many one-armed men I should not rescue you, but I... I understand you've always liked me That's why you kept your distance I did keep my distance from you You rescued me tonight I won't treat you as a servant You don't have to keep your distance Xiaoman? Xiaoman I rescued you, but you put me in trouble What am I going to tell her? She's just a country girl The night you cut off my arm... she saved my life To be honest with you, you're wrong I never liked you That's not the reason that... I kept my distance from you I rescued you today because I owe it to your father But I've always loved you Loved me? You tried your best to torture me You cut off my arm Because you were arrogant I don't want to hear about it It's late. Your father would be worried You go home now and I should be home, too You live with that girl? Yes, go home You won't come home with me? Father misses you I rescued you today and that's it We won't see each other again You prefer a country girl to me Yes Xiaoman Xiaoman Xiaoman You should go home with her What're you doing here? You've only heard her part of the tale I never liked her I told her thatjust now Why did you rescue her then? She asked me the same question I owed it to my teacher, her father My teacher is heroic swordsman I can't let her... be the cause of his ruin Had she been assaulted... How could my teacher face anyone? My Mom always said... she'd rather marry a farmer and live happily and peacefully than marry a swordsman; Because they'd die for... the reputation of their teacher My father sacrificed himself... to protect the book that he inherited from his teacher My Mom said they act heroically They appear righteous and courageous Girls always fall for them She told me not to be fooled Ironically, I... Xiaoman, I am maimed I don't wish to be a swordsman anymore I just told Pei-er the same thing I rescued her and repaid my teacher's kindness We would not meet again I'd like to stay with you and become a farmer if it's okay with you You mean it? Yes, I mean it We must leave now I suppose Pei-er will tell her father... that she saw you Your teacher might come looking But you have your house and field here It's okay. Mother left me some money which can support us for a while I'll ask Grandpa Wang to sell the house and the field, and send me the money It's not my real homeland anyway I just want to be with you Then we leave at daybreak Should we report the death of Pei Xun to our teacher? Normally, we'd be able to keep such things... from our teacher But tomorrow is his birthday Learning about Pei Xun's death... will only break his heart I think we'd better reveal the news later I'm afraid it's not going to work Teacher Qi is going to choose his successor He'll gather all his disciples here There are only 20 of us who are active outside Up to this moment, five of us are missing How can we fool him? I think... I'll report to him then Quiet. Teacher is coming Teacher Be seated What're you talking about? Nothing. We're just chatting You all grew up in front of me You think you can fool me? I can see it's about some serious trouble It's definitely notjust chatting Teacher, Pei Xun and 3 other brothers cannot make it tomorrow We know you won't be happy about that Still want to fool me? I know it all Except for them, you're all here? Where're Deng Chong and Lu Zhen? They haven't arrived yet Could they be... Don't worry, Teacher. They've acquired most of teacher's swordsmanship especially Deng Chong. It'll be alright Brother, we walk too slowly I'm afraid we'll fall behind others Lu Zhen, can't you see... I've deliberately slowed down my pace There's something unusual about Pei's death I believe we're watched by our enemy and they've created some techniques specially to counter our sword techniques I see. So you slow down your pace so as to lure the enemy to attack us and to find out who they are, is it? And what sort of skills they use! That's right. So don't fall asleep tonight Be careful and be on the alert We try to gather some information Tomorrow, our brothers will get together to celebrate teacher's birthday We'll think of something Right Go... Okay See? We pretend not to know that and wait for them to come back Brother My 2 disciples have suffered serious injuries so I asked the Law brothers to help Here they are Thanks for your help What happened to your disciples? I'll tell you some other time Because the Law brothers... saw two of Qi's disciples in an inn a while back Tomorrow is Qi's birthday I believe we'll see more of them You and the Laws ambush them on the road Ding Peng, Ba Shuang and I... will handle the chaps at the inn Then we'll go to Qi's estate Yes Qi's disciples, come out now I'll go first and try to find out their strategy Who're you? What do you want from us? Tell me your name first I'll tell you I'm Deng Chong, Qi's seventh disciple This is my brother Lu Zhen I know who you are Good for you. I'm Long-armed Devil Those not concerned with this, leave now Or I'm afraid you may be hurt in the fight Yes... Come on, return to your rooms now... It's none of our business... Let's go... Come on Deng Chong Lu Zhen, go. You promised me Go, quickly It's late Let's stay in the inn tonight Alright Lu Zhen Fang Gang, what happened to your arm? That's not important Tell me what happened to you Quickly Long-armed Devil is in the inn Deng Chong is seriously hurt Please go and tell our teacher and brothers that Long-armed Devil has killed... five of our brothers He invented a strange weapon which can lock our golden swords When our swords are locked, he uses... a knife with his right hand to kill us Lu Zhen He said Long-armed Devil is at the inn But Deng Chong is in there too He's dead. Report to the authorities Where're they? They killed this man... then leapt over the wall and left You stay in the inn and wait for me I must warn my teacher Are you going back? Xiaoman, Deng Chong and Lu Zhen were killed They were heroic young men They too have parents, wives and children They too are loved by their families But they sacrificed themselves for our teacher and brothers Take Lu Zhen for example; he was injured... but he still struggled to warn our teacher He asked me to do this for him before he died How can I let him down? But, Ah Gang... It's not only a matter of reputation They want to kill all my brothers Xiaoman, they're young men like me Can you help refraining from saving them? If I leave with you without warning my teacher and brothers I'll never find peace for the rest of my life Listen, everyone today's celebration is a bit different I believe Long-armed Devil will be here soon Deng Chong and Lu Zhen haven't arrived I'm afraid they might have been killed I decided not to invite guests since I plan to choose my successor today It's good I didn't invite any guest You're my families and disciples Let's change back to our fighting gear and bring your swords with you and wait for the enemy to show up Yes No - Where's the master? - Peace Bridge The Laws said they see no Qi's disciples Where is your uncle? He's at Peace Bridge It's not early. Let's go to Qi's estate Yes Look, he's carrying a golden sword He has only one arm though Son, from your golden sword I can tell you are Qi's disciple But you have only one arm It's useless to you So why don't you give it to us and kowtow 3-times to each of us then we'll let you go No? Then I'll have to take it from you Waiter, bring me some wine The waiter has left. Let me bring you some You know, if I were you... I would leave immediately Go on I was blind You're Qi's disciple too You use your disability to fool us and stay near us to watch us carefully I now know who you are You're Long-armed Devil's brother Smiling Tiger Cheng Tianshou So, our identities are exposed We don't have to pretend now You owe my disciples two arms but you have only one left I'll have to kill you to get revenge Pull out your golden sword now Qi Rufeng, we're here Pei-er, bring me my sword Let's tackle the enemy first so as to find out their moves Right, fight for our teacher Father Long-armed Devil, long time no see! Qi Rufeng, I'm here to settle an old score, with you from 13 years ago I'll celebrate your death today Your martial arts must have improved a lot since our fight 13 years back But it wasn't a heroic act... to ambush and kill my disciples You should've come straight to me Teacher, wait a minute Today is your birthday Let's handle them I'm Wei Xuan. Let me fight with you first Qi Rufeng, listen I never killed your disciples My disciples did all the killings Ding Peng, Ba Shuang you fight with his disciples Yes Yes. Let's... fight with your disciples Come on Come on Teacher, the lock... Everyone, let's get revenge for our brothers Hu Yue You specially designed this weapon to lock my golden sword So let my sword meet your lock Ding Peng, Ba Shuang, step down Let me settle my old score... with him myself Teacher... Qi Rufeng, you want to say something? Hu Yue, you're not his match Long-armed Devil, I admit defeat I won't ask for your mercy But my family and disciples... have nothing to do with this Please let them go Qi Rufeng, you know me better than that They'll get vengeance if I spare them today You intend killing them all?! Teacher, don't ask for his mercy We'd rather die You want to fight together? One-to-one You're not my match I'll let you die Stop, I'll do it myself We prefer death before dishonor Our teacher won't beg for your mercy But Mrs and Miss Qi are ladies Let them go if you've any conscience left Qi Rufeng, will you kill yourself... Or should I do it for you? Father Hold it I'm Qi's disciple too Fang Gang Ah Gang! Teacher Ah Gang I was delayed by Devil's brother en route I am late. Please forgive me Ah Gang, we suffered a crushing defeat What're you doing here? You raised me and taught me martial arts If I can't help you to fight them off... at least I can die with you Ding Peng, Ba Shuang, look he has only one arm He wants to die with the others Well then, let's give it to him Alright Hey you, come on Ah Gang, we owe you too much You lost an arm You really shouldn't be involved Teacher, please take a seat Ah Gang So there is a swordsman like you... among Qi's disciples Let me fight with you Well, do you accept defeat? Fang Gang Fang Gang... Teacher My daughter cut off your arm and you, however, return good for evil Even more valuable is that your martial arts... has improved a lot in just a few months Teacher, I'm maimed I decided to lead an ordinary life Then I got a martial-arts book... from a girl who is waiting for me at the inn I'm leaving. Guess we won't meet again I will be a farmer Fang Gang Oh, papa My dear!
