I wanted to talk to you because I've been thinking ... I don't want to retire yet. I don't know why I retired. I don't know who convinced me, but I don't want to retire. And the store with Karina? Nothing. It's all right. Still standing, but I can't stay behind a counter for the rest of my life. It is not my beach. Are you sure? I think you need money, don't you? Do not. I want to fight for the world championship. I want you to get me a fight. Are you sure? In your category, the youngest will finish you off. There are many of them in their category. These young people are idiots! They don't know how to fight. I can still finish them off. Ai, Ramón, You surprise me. -Stay for dinner, okay? -Right. Kari. Kari. Kari. ALONSO "CAMPEÃO" What are you doing in my bed? Who let you in? The door was open. I don't like being in my room. If you stay here, you have to be mine. I mean it. You'll love me? Sim. Fuck me.

Move your head. Great! Come on! You chickenshit! What's up? Why are you fighting a woman? She asked me to train her. She is good! Yes very good. -Come here a moment. -What's it? -What? -I'll be back. -Right! -He's coming back. I need to ask you a favor. It is a fight display in Avellaneda. It's for my campaign. It will cheer up the audience. Do you know what the ticket will be? Non-perishable food for a children's canteen in the neighborhood. I am asking this for the children. But we fought recently, he hasn't recovered yet, Osvaldo. Which is! You'll fight for a while and bring some money home. Bye. How many rounds? Three. I brought an advance. Look. Thousand. Dollars. Then I'll give you two more. You know what? Peralta will be there. He owns a few bingos and has invested heavily in entertainment. He wants to enter the boxing world. He will get the fight you want. -What do we talk about? -Yes. Sure. And the kids? They are with Marta. -Where were you last night? -In a hotel. -Really? -I knocked, the door was locked. Don't lie to me, Ramón. I will continue to fight. I spoke to Di Nucci. It's all right. Why are you doing this to me? Because? The store is not for me. You have to run the business. I want to continue to fight. This is to finish the store. Or for anything else. Do you bring me money? Like I'm a whore? I am the mother of your children, Ramón. You need to respect me. You need to respect me! I dropped everything to be with you. I left my family, my country, to come to this country shit with a savage like you! And now? And now that my time has come, you go with another woman. With a whore! With a whore you found on the street! Because? Because? Why are you doing this? Because? I need to be with you so badly. Come on, Tiger! Come on, champion! Come on, champion! That's right! Take the picture later. There will be more pictures. Let's go. Peralta! On here. How are you? He is here. It is an honor to have you here, Tiger. Thank you. Is a pleasure. This is my wife. Dona Karina. Sir... Is a pleasure. I hope it is a good performance. The expectation is great. - Did you bring the belt? -How is it? - Did you bring the belt? -No. - I didn't. -What a pity! -We wanted to see. -The next time. Diego, come here! This is Diego "Diamante" Saldívar. -He will fight you. -How are you? All right? -How is it? Diamond? -Yes. Why "Diamond"? Because it is hard, very expensive and is useless. Let's go!

Applause, guys, for Ramón "O Tigre" Alvia! For school canteen number 25. Thank you again... this wonderful night in Avellaneda. -Something's missing? -No, nothing. -Is ready! -Want me to serve? So! Come on, Ramón! Ramon! What's it? -What's up? -Everything is ready? Sim. Ramón and I plan to go to Italy. Children don't know. Yes! To the beach, para Capri. - Isn't it cold now? -No, why? When it's winter, it's summer. It is very hot. - Can you fish? -Almost 40 degrees. -Want me to serve? -Forty. Mom! -Give me the ball! -What's it? -Give me the ball! -No. Stop! The ball is mine. My goodness! No more beer? No, they drank everything. I'll buy more. Can't you drink something else? I can not. There's no more. -Ramón! -O country? You are forgetting the hooves. Get out of here! Are you crazy? Get out! Good Morning! Good Morning. I worked here with my father. He helped him with the smithy. When the old man died, I didn't know what to do with it. So I kept it. - Anyone know her? -No nobody. I often come here and spend the whole day here. I hide. Why did you leave the pension? Am I the first one you bring here? Yes, the first. Come here! Will you stay here! He's not going anywhere. Will not return for that shitty job on the market. How do you know about the market? Up here! Don't walk backwards! If they want to attack you, look! Hands on your hips! A! Hands on your hips! A! One two! One two three four! Never repeat the same combination. If I pass the hand, straight from the right. If I stick my hand, straight from the left. Bar the hand, straight from the left. No! If I get down, cross from the right. If I bend over, crossed with the right. Clump! Come on! Below, crossed with the right. Pull your head off! One important thing: you are in the middle of a fight and you are being slaughtered. You stay calm, you don't care. When you get punched lightly, you step back, as if you were serious. Draw back. When the guy raises his arm ... Hook in the liver. He will go months without eating eggs. You are a buck! Did I make you laugh? Let's continue! What are you doing? What are you doing? -Stop! -No! It seems! Stop this! No! No! You're a little bitch! Give me a kiss! What are you from Alonso? The boxer. Are you related to him? Why do you ask? What's it? Just asked. Have you been spying on me? No, the photo was there. He was my father. He had a family when he got my mother pregnant. He had a wife and children. I met him because he was at home. But then he went to Buenos Aires, and I stopped seeing him. -I fought him. Did you know? -Yes. I met him. Then he got hurt and was unable to box. He started to steal. He was killed by the police. His brains blew out. Sure. Tom, baby. That has passed. -Please. -Yes. - Can you bring one more? -Clear. Why did you do that? Do you think I'm an idiot? What's it? Crazy? You looked at her ass! Are you crazy? Don't meddle, you bastard! Take it easy. I don't know why I came. Son of a bitch! Let me go! -You want to fuck the waitress! -What? Come here! Come here, Deborah! Fuck the waitress! Leave me alone! Do not touch me! What's wrong with you? Don't touch me or I'll finish you! I finish you! Go fuck the waitress! What did I do for you, asshole? What? You son of a bitch! Screw U! I hate you! I don't know why I came! You are sick! -Want to fight? Come on, you crapper! -You are sick! -Let me go! -I'll break your head! Calm down! Release me, you son of a bitch! I will finish you! I'm going to rip your balls off! You won't see me again! Holy shit, can you calm down? Want to explain to me ... Want to explain to me what I did? -What was that? -Nothing. It was in Las Vegas. My eye looked like this, with the eyelid turned. Covered in blood. A left hook. I knocked him out in the fifth round. I lost the fight for the points. The Yankees stole the fight from me! Dulio Garrone, Naples, 1997. Touch. What is it? Double fracture of the lower jaw. I broke the bastard's liver. He couldn't fight anymore. Not even eating eggs. How was it to fight with my father? He was retiring. I won for the points. He put up with 12 rounds. Good boxer. Very good. What year was it? 1999 or 2000. -I was four years old. -Yes. I was seven. Is here? What happened here? -Who is it? -Do not know. I'll check. -Stay here. -You will see? Hi! How did you know I was here? I've known you for 20 years. I know who to ask. Is it your new nest? Very beautiful. How's the campaign going? Good! I am achieving a lot. Did the exhibition help? Of course. Why not? The media, the people. It was very useful. I got a fight in the South American. Peralta is organizing. A great location. Sponsor, TV, everything. Good money. But it's the South American! I said I wanted to fight in the world championship. I don't want to risk the title. If you don't defend it, you will lose it. It expires after three months. To go to the world cup, you need a good defense, a better score. Do you want wine? Who would I fight with? With the boxer from Peralta. -Saldívar? -Yes. Who knows him? He has a great score. It would be an official fight. -Hi. -How are you? Hi. I don't want to fight a guy that nobody knows. It won't be good for me. Who knows this guy? A fight between an experienced Argentine and a newbie is a good fight. It will raise expectations. Organize the fight I asked for. I don't want any other. You are more beautiful up close. Thanks. Congratulations, Ramón. To renew is to live. I should do the same. Cheers! Come on, old man. -I do not want. -Dance with me. Come on. One two. One two. I do not know how to dance. I teach. Come on. -I do not know how to dance. -Come, grandma. And four. I turn. One two, three. Where did you learn to dance like that? I learned it myself. You had a lot of boyfriends, didn't you? I never had a boyfriend. Never had. They're all motherfuckers. You fucked all of them. What's it? They're going to bring him. Where? Here? Yes wait. Maxi is in class. They're going to bring him. I have to go to the bathroom. What are you doing here? How are you going? Don't you greet me? I came to see you, silly! You said we were going to the beach together. You're a liar! Let's go to the beach! You left with another woman. Is not true! What are you saying? -IS. Let me go. -I'm training. -Let me go. -Why do I have to go? -I want to stay with you. I came to see you. -Let me go. -You're a liar. -Give this to your sister. Share it with her. Send her a big kiss. Say I love you very much. What are you giving me? Let me go. What the fuck are you doing here? Ramón, I got a lawyer. I will take the children to Italy. Go to your class! Where are you going to take them? It won't take anyone! I will ruin your life, Ramón! I swear! Why can't I see my kids? Why not! You are a son of a bitch! You should go. What are you doing here? I am their father! -Dad? -Why can't I see them? Ramón, I will ruin your life. Go away. You're not going to get them anywhere, do you hear? Do not touch me! And one day, he abandoned his father and the mother. And he left with his wife. And together, they have become one. What are you doing? What are you doing, son of a bitch? - What were you doing with my wife? - Taking care of her. Taking care of you! Taking care of who, you drunk? Do you want to fuck my wife? Do you want to keep my life, you bastard? Wants to know? For me, you died! He died, understand? I've been thinking about the fight. Yes, with that little boy. I'll accept. But with one condition. The girl fights before me. I want her to fight before me. Left. That. Punch. That, left. Break and waist. Left. Left. Break and waist. -How are you? -Move yourself, walk. -Very well. -It's all right? It looks beautiful outside. The TV is already broadcasting. Listen, when we're done here, we go to a restaurant. I organized a huge party! Come on, champion! Take care of him.

I want to go down, Ramón. -I feel bad. -Nothing will happen. You are with me. I'm Ramón Alvia! Nothing is going to happen. Listen. Let's travel. Let's hit the road. Let's go to the sea! Let's see the sea! You don't know the sea! Where are you going? Come here! Come here! Come here! Where are you going? -Listen to me! -I want to go home. Didn't you hear what I said? Hear what I say!
