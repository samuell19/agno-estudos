INDEX (LIFE AND ART OF JOZEF M.) What the hell should I talk to him about? They hassle me all the time. - Hi. - Hi. Listen, I agreed that we have a separate hall in the palace. - Fifty? - Fifty per person. As I said. Maria and Anna, go there to organise something. - Some sandwiches? All right? - Yeah. Listen, as we said, we meet in the palace in half an hour, all right? Fifty per person. - Listen, is that guy one of us? - Too little. - No, it’s enough. - Are you with us? Hi, I’m Andrzej. - Jozek. Listen, we’re organising a party in the palace in half an hour. Are you in? - Fifty zloty per head. - But I don’t have the cash. - I’ll pay for you. - I’ll pay you back. The Dean is coming. What, am I late? But I had a lot to do. I’ll slip in somehow. - Hi! - Hi! - Daria, where is the... You know... - There. Didn’t I tell you to be careful? And you just barge in... - Hold that here for a minute. - All right. Wait... - Could you fold it a bit. - Go on. No, thanks. I can’t open the doors. Jozek, I have a question. That girl, the one that sits there, this blonde, is she from our year? That one? Yeah. Wait, wait... Show me. Let me see it. Andrzej! Let’s sing this song of Okudzhava. He who will dare our union mar deserves the most severe sentence. I wouldn't give a grey guitar for his damned life and his repentance. So fervently the age intends to knock us down with a feather... Let's join our hands my friends, Let's join our hands my friends, we won't get lost, if we're together. Let's join our hands my friends, Let's join our hands my friends, we won't get lost, if we're together. At alien feasts on festive days, amidst the shaky truths and fairness, before we hear the words of praise we will spruce up and preen our feathers. While our stupid plume portends a lasting journey, full of care, Let's join our hands... I’ve written it. Let me see it. - Show me. - Well? - Hi - Hi, hi. I’ve read it. Everything is okay, we'll be back in two weeks. - Lewandowski is not there. - What d’you mean “not there”? - I mean Tadek is not on the list. - There are only 28 people. - It’s a mistake. - Can’t be a mistake. - Too many of these mistakes. - Just check it with the Dean. So, let’s go to the Dean. - No, everything is all right. - We must check it with the Dean. - He doesn’t have visiting hours! - What does that mean? - How will I get there? - It’s simple. You’ll see! - How will you get to see him? - Come! I’ll show you. Hello, is the Dean in? - The Dean doesn’t see people today. - Is he in? I said clearly that he doesn’t see people today. Please come during visiting hours. Excuse me, but visiting hours are at a surgery. - I won’t have this kind of behaviour. - Tell the Dean that we are here. - Ah, my boys! - Good day, Sir. I’m glad to see you. Would you be so good? - You want to see me? - Yes. Well, come in then boys, come in. We need just a few minutes of your time, sir, no more. Sit down. Here. Well? We’re slowly returning to normalcy. Coming back home, huh? I don't want to be moralistic, but I have the impression that you will help me to organise it all, so as not to give anyone a reason to make any drastic decisions. - Sir, Mr Lechowicz is here. - Tell him to wait a minute. Well, I’m listening. Sir, we came to clarify something. A minute ago, we were reading the list on the board, and we noticed that not all the names are there. We wanted to know if these were irrevocable decisions. It's about a few colleagues... Actually, about Tadek Lewandowski, who is not on the list. We don’t understand why. There is nothing against him. You know him, sir. He’s a very good student. It’s the time of army conscription now, and I think... - We have to deal with it somehow. - I thought that you are... more intelligent. You know, that undertaking any official talks regarding these matters is difficult for both, you and I. Prudence ... boys, prudence. I know that prudence never was the companion of youth, but only prudence can help us with solving these controversial issues. Yes. Of course, we understand that, but the question is... When will we get a definite decision? The point is to make it happen as soon as possible. - After all, the guy cannot wait. - Yes. Just a minute. I’ll will keep you up to date on everything. You will be kept informed. I’ll make sure that every case is dealt with fairly and comprehensively. That’s all. - What about this Lewandowski? - Maybe at a special meeting... - Or maybe I deal with it myself. - Please, do. I didn’t think that... I'm glad to see a representative of youth. Come in. Such matters should be dealt with in the presence of a member of the student authorities. - You know each other, right? - Hi. So, we came to an agreement. We have taken care of everything and if you have any problems, come and see me. - Thank you very much and... - My pleasure. Wait a minute. I see no reason that we should thank each other now. We came here about Tadek Lewandowski, and this issue has to be dealt with. What should he wait for? A ticket to the army? It seems to me, that your tone is most inappropriate. You’ll never get anything done in this way. I don’t want to get anything done. I just want to know who made the decision with regards to Lewandowski. Someone makes decisions here, isn’t that so? Mister Moneta, you are forgetting that you are in the Dean’s office. And you don’t have to wait for anything. You have some specific tasks, don’t you? We all have them. First of all, to study. Exactly. Lately, our student research group... I repeat, study first of all. We have to show everyone that... But what do we have to show?! And to whom? I think there is no need for you to raise you voice and make a scene. I also feel that further discussion is inadvisable. That means that Lewandowski will not be admitted, right? - Then I’m quitting, too. - Don’t be silly. That’s your decision. Yes, hello? Speaking. - That’s one big fuck-up! - Wait! - Tell somebody to... - Leave me! Wait! And you are an idiot! The way you talk to them! Everything was going well and that Rochowicz came... I don’t care about Rochowicz, Lewandowski is important. Everything was arranged. It just needed another visit to the Dean, but he messed it up! What do you mean? Even if he messed it up, he was right. But why? One should deal with it quietly and not like a madman! - Not like a madman. - Listen, wait, stop! May I... Are you going to the May Day March? - Baraszczak is going! - Then go with him. May I... Look, Maria, we have to go to the Dean again and talk further, - quietly… - What? But what happened there? I would like to know what you said. Nothing happened. He quit. That’s all. - What have you done? - He’s bullshitting you. - Everyone to the assembly hall! - What for? - Name? - Moneta. - How? - Moneta. Storage receipt. It is stated that the following items are seized during the personal search of... - Jozef Moneta. - Again? Jozef Moneta. - Profession? Student? - Former student. - What is a former student? - I used to be a student. A student. - A student. Cell number 5. - Let’s go! No dad, I don't have any problems. One more exam, and that's nothing. I’m glad. - What about specialization? - That’s in the third year. Leave him alone! Thank you. You could get dressed at least. - I won't eat. - That’s what my life looks like. Mum, did I have to come and listen to it all the time? You know that I want to rest a bit. Don’t I have the right to rest? I could also go to the hairdresser, and buy me something new, to look decent. Do you know what they call me? A bag lady. A bag lady. I’m not all that old, after all. I've had enough of all this. I’ll leave him and start all over again. Mum... I shouldn’t bother you with it, Sonny. I only want for you to graduate, to be somebody in life. My life is over with this... - Mum, please! - ...drunkard. It’s enough that I don't have peace in this house! See, it’s like that every day. Every day! And I’m fed up with it all! Fed up! - Eat, my boy, eat… - Mum, you can’t be like that… Eat, dear, eat. Just tell him to stop drinking. Forbid him to drink! Please, forbid him! To the kitchen! Let go of me! Calm down! I can't stand it any longer! Do you understand? Leave her alone! Kyziol, who the fuck did you take those four tonnes to? What do you mean? He’s a regular client. He always takes it. He did, in the old apartment. D’you know, who lives next to him now? Who? I didn’t know, I swear to God. Jasiek? - What’s up? - Some sleazy story at 25. - I don’t know anything. - I told you to be careful. - Business goons. - All right. But why have they taken only me? Jozek, did you get a summons? No. They hassle everyone. I don't know why you care. In that case, somebody squealed. You’re nuts Kyziol! You’re picking on the student, so I’m explaining it to you. You go to the market and start selling pilfered coal and then you’re surprised that they hassle you. Is it itching? Go and piss on your hands. I went twice already. - That’s Boy’s old number. - And where is Boy? - Shovelling coal on number three. - How come he’s such a busy bee? Watch out guys, the foreman. Gentlemen! I beg you! At least for an hour... or we’ll have downtime. - We already have. - Yeah. But it’ll be longer. - Why should they pick us up? - You stay here, Student, keep warm. Better read that Kirkegaard. The manager asked about you. What did he want? I don’t know. I think he wanted to talk to you about something. - Where is he now? - Somewhere by the wagons. - Listen, Moneta… - Yes? I have something for you. You are an intelligent, well-read man. - You were studying... - Kind of. Well. We are not interested how it all ended, but we want to include you in the social work of our youth collective. March is approaching, so it would be good to prepare a bulletin, a little show or a cabaret to make our ladies happy. Then, the management would be happy, you’d be happy and we all gain. What do you think of it? But I don’t deal with education. - It’s just a trifle, you’ll cope. - Jozek! Boy got buried by coal! Fucking hell, I knew this would happen. You better leave it. This is not a job for you. You’ll go mad. Like Boy. Thank you. - Fourth. - The same. Jozek! What are you doing here? Don’t you recognise me? Apparently, you wrote a decent text. They talk about it, so it must be good. Don’t lean on the button. Apparently, you have problems, right? I managed to get a foothold here. I’ll wait. So far, just as a trainee, but it’s okay. 2,500 a month. And in one year – 3,500 plus some assignments. Not bad, huh? Plus, contacts with writers. And, the most important - flexible working hours. - That’s important… - You can come and go as you wish. - Maybe you should think about it. - What would I do here? Look, our boss is young. He’s looking for guys like us, right? - He wants to change everything. - It could work. Pull this down! So? You have a good start with this text of yours, but you must push hard. Miss Marina, is all arranged, do you know? But that’s thanks to you! My dear! - I love you. Great! - Miss Marinia... And what time are you coming to work? I’ve been working here for a long time, so has Mr. Jurek, but you? - Did you bring the proofed text? - No, but it wasn’t for today. Really? And for when? - Sorry, I got mixed up. - Exactly. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I came about this text. - What text? My name is Moneta. I’ve submitted a text. Aha, Mister Moneta. We’ve already had some reviews, apparently, the text is excellent. A young talent. Bravo! Very good, very good. Keep it up... Excellent. I’m glad, because I have this money situation... Yes, but the chief was on holiday and I gave him your text to read only a couple of days ago. But maybe something could be arranged in the meantime... Yes, sir. Yes, yes, all right. Excuse me, sir, Mr. Moneta is here. - What Moneta? - Mister Jozef Moneta. Deal with it yourself and don’t bother me. Yes. Okay. I understand. All right. Well, in principle everything is going very well... So, maybe I could prepare a contract for Mr Moneta? You prepare the report I’ve asked you for two days ago. So we’re going to sign a contract? You are stubborn like a child. I’m trying to explain to you, that... well... the final decision has not been taken yet. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. - Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you. - Tea? - Yes, tea, thanks a lot. Zenia, please bring the gentleman some tea. I have one, thank you. - Cigarette? - Thank you. Well, I’d like to know what I can expect. Look, as far as I know, there are some corrections to be made; it’s simply a question of having to edit a thing or two. You mean making some changes to the text? No, it just that you are still very young. The text is very good. I mean we want you to make a good impression, so… - It just needs a bit of an edit. - So, what am I to do? Are you buying the text or not? Calm down. I told you, that... in principle yes, but you still have to... In that case I want to talk to the Chief Editor. You are wrong... In principle, I like it. What does it mean “in principle”? Please, explain it to me. It means that you have to... It’s easy to gather some negative facts, give it a nice punchline... - You are new at it, right? - Right. You could find something more difficult without this whole... There are some nice phrases... No, no, but it’s not that... With a few corrections. For example: - Five zloty per ton? - Well, they pay only for... - Who’s interested in it? - I don’t know. Maybe nobody. - And he got buried in the end. - He did. He got buried. Did he have to? No, he didn’t. - Maybe he doesn’t get buried. - Maybe he doesn’t. - Could he jump aside? - He could. - Then make him jump aside. Well, we’ve got a deal Just those few bits, and the contract is waiting for you tomorrow. - Thank you. - My pleasure. All the best… Well, are you in? Well? - Are you reading it? Hey? - Tea is brewing! - It’s hot.… - What is this? There are many great stories in here. Do you know who Polezhaev was? No. Wait, is he the one you talked to at the seminar? No, that was Sumburov. You always get things mixed up. Polezhaev wrote a pamphlet about the tsar. Once they woke him up at night and took him to the palace. He walks in, the tsar is sitting, waiting for him. He approaches, the tsar takes the pamphlet and says: “Polezhaev, read it out loud!” So, he read it out loud for two hours, standing up. - Standing up? - It was a very long pamphlet. The tsar looks around the hall, and sees the university curator; they also woke him up and brought him in, so, he asks, "What is the opinion about this Polezhaev?" You see, this curator didn’t have a clue what it’s all about, but he felt sorry for the guy, so, he says, "Excellent, excellent!" Then the tsar comes up to Polezhaev, kisses his forehead and says, "Write to me, write, and if I write back, it means that I forgave you". - Did he forgive him? - Well, to date he hasn’t written back. And what about you, did you finish writing? What? - I don’t know what you were writing. - Yes. - Did they accept it? - In principle, yes. - Did they accept it or not? - Well, no. Why not? They said that the text is very good, but a thing or two need editing. What has to be edited? A thing or two. - Here’s sugar. - You know I don’t take sugar. - And you, naturally, didn’t... - Naturally... Naturally I didn’t. - Why don’t you want to talk to me? - Jesus! What "Jesus"? You don’t want to talk to me. You are just telling me some stories, some idiotic stories, about some tsars, about Polezhaev... - So what? - You never talk to me. - I don’t know anything about you. - Yes, you don’t know... - I don’t, I don’t! - Yes, you don’t! You only go to that coal yard. I know, because they saw you... Do we have to talk about the same thing over and over again? - So, what are we to talk about? - Are you mad that I live differently? Do you think there is no other way to earn money? What "other way to earn money”? Where are my socks? I have... You just took offence. At me and at the entire world. - What else will you think of? - It wasn’t only you they expelled! Listen, keep on sitting in this library of yours and read your books. Do I blame you for that? - Because you would sit there! - I would! You’re waiting for a phone call. You just sit and wait... I wouldn’t mind sitting… When the professor calls you and asks for you. - And this Andrzej as well. - What does Andrzej have to do with it? You have to have some strength in you... some humility. Humility! Andrzej! What are we talking about? Listen, I do... You are just a little brat! Shit! I’ve signed a contract and got the money. I paid for two months in advance! Have you got a mirror? Ninety eight. Have you got your birth certificate? What are you talking about? What birth certificate? Well, if I am to marry you, you need your birth certificate. Because without it... What? What’s that... You told me that you’ll marry me, when you were drunk. - Well, you know... - Always. Don’t ask me to be sober every day. So, what about it? Wait a minute… - Mister Moneta. - Just a moment… Just a moment. He doesn’t pay, but he brings the women in! Get out this very moment! - We’ll call the militia! - Come on, we’ll call the militia! He doesn’t pay, but he brings the women in! You see, I don't have a flat right now, the money is a bit scarce, and relations with the editorial office got complicated. - So what? Do you have problems? - Exactly. Who doesn’t? Come and see us next week, because Anna and I are now going fishing to Chroberz. - You have our number, call us. - Okay. Ah, you don’t have money, huh? - Here. - No... Take it. Thanks a lot for the loan, but, you know, it’s mainly about the flat. - My mum said that if I came over... - Oh yes, how is she? I go there less often now, you know, this flat and other problems. I know, it’s hard for everyone now. - Give it to me. - That’s mine. - Okay. Open the bonnet. - Right. - Well, look. - What is it? Last week I bought a new ignition module. My secretary was calling the company shop for six months, eventually I managed to get it through some contacts. And what? The driver put it in and it still takes 13 litres per 100. A lot, huh? Or those tyres... Well, maybe we’ll get there. - Hi, Jozek! - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. I bought those cigarettes. What a meeting! - Why don’t you ever come to see us? - Well, you live a bit far away. Come on, don’t be silly. Karol and I are going to Chroberz for a week. - It’s cold, but we go fishing. - Yes, I know. He told me. You should have come to see us sooner, we could have... some coffee, or... - have some tea. - Some tea. We could have. Well, look... You know, I was thinking. What if we meet, you know, all our group, have a little talk... It would be nice, wouldn’t it? - Yeah, it would. - Somehow, we all went different ways. I don’t know why. - How is your flat hunting? - I’m still looking for something. Generally, you look great. - Maybe he could stay in our place... - Anna, please, Boreccy are waiting. - Jozek’s got a place for now. - Yes, I do. I have four flats. You could’ve stopped playing an idiot at least in front of her. Please, not in that tone of voice. You have nowhere to live, because nobody can put up with you. - But Karol, why are you... - Because you don’t respect anyone! - You’re careless, lazy, and an agitator! - And what else? - And your mother was like that. - Leave my mother out of it. Calm down, people are looking! And watch your wife there, so she doesn't catch a cold! - Now, that’s a dirty trick! - Dirty... You’ll regret it one day! You’re a lout! - Mrs Papuzinska, coal! - I’m coming! So, Mrs Papuzinska? Do we have a deal? - Well, 500 zloty. - Jasiu? 500 zloty? Then let’s go to another Jew. - What are you saying? 500 zloty? - It was 600 last year. You know how much it was last year. And you are giving us 500. - All right, 700. - 700? Jasiu? - So, what are we doing, Mrs Papuzinska? - 750 and we go ahead. - Agreed. - Good. We’ve got a deal. I don’t know whether a ton will fit in there. - Just fill it up. - All right. We’ll see. The cellar is small, but we go ahead. We’ll see. Jozek?! Come here. - I didn’t know that you live here. - Yes, I do. - I’m dirty. - So am I. I’m cleaning the carpets. What have you been doing all this time? - Trying to survive, like everybody. - Yes. You've always complicated your life, you never could adapt. - Well, Sir... - I am no longer a dean. What should I adapt to? To a flat, for which I would wait 15 years? To my own fears? I thought you would be my best student, you would go far. - You know how much it costs. - Yes. - And what now? - I don’t know. I care about the simplest things now. I want to be honest. Do you manage that? I’d like to tell you one day that I did. Tell me Moneta, do you think that... you acted sensibly then? - Then, yes. - And now? Sir, I never had the chance to apologise for what happened then, but I’d like you to know that I didn’t mean to offend you. - The right to choose is the main thing. - Jozek! Well, goodbye then. Come and see me one day, you know, where I live. All right. But tomorrow at the latest. You see, we don't want to force you into anything. You have your own mind and your own life. But only one life. Remember that, only one. I don't understand what you are saying. I didn't get any official summons. I had a phone call and I came here of my own free will, and you talk to me as if I were arrested. “Arrested” is a big word. What for? An arrest is not necessary. We're just talking, right? Excuse me Sir, there are no breadsticks. May I serve biscuits? I asked not to be interrupted. But you asked for two teas so, I thought it’s as usual. All right, leave it, but please remember for the future. Help yourself. - Thank you, I don't take sugar. - I do, and a lot at that. You see, at home we drank tea with raspberry juice and now every tea seems bitter to me. - Well, then let’s talk about tea. - Indeed. And how about girls? Do they still think that you’re a little brat? I don’t know what you’re talking about. Mr Moneta, there were some complaints. You are not registered for permanent residency, you don't actually work anywhere. Well, you understand that shovelling coal, is not a job for you, right? - It’s a job. - What job ... it’s physical work. And where... and with whom at that. And inciting to suicide is a nasty story. Nearly like a murder. - I don’t understand. - Such is our information. I advise you. Change the environment. They’ll never accept you there. They’ll be the first to rat on you. We have the testimony of Kyziol, your friend from the coal yard. Apparently, you talked to Boy about someone called Kirkegaard, and the next day Boy was dead. - He didn’t jump aside and was buried. - Right. Apparently, he was nuts. But you are not. So, what about your life? You have to decide. - How about going back to university? - No. But why? We could help you. You’ll catch up, maybe right away for the diploma year. It ceased to interest me. You know what? I think, you should go away somewhere. Somewhere far, to see something abroad. - I have no such plans. - Well, plans do change. You can't go on shovelling coal all your life, surely? And inciting coal workers to some silly acts to boot. What are you talking about? Those four tons of coal, was it a perfectly legal matter? - Who covered it up? - Me, naturally. Naturally I wasn’t you. But you know who. You know more than you tell us and that's no good. You don’t trust us. Pity. You have to decide. We have only one life and a very short one at that. Coal workers are not allowed to read Kirkegaard. You have a demoralizing effect on them. You explain some gibberish to them. Sorry, maybe not gibberish, but in these conditions... you understand it yourself. A man has to be prepared, worked over like a dough. And baked only then, otherwise it will go flat. You have to educate slowly, and not straight away destruction and this ... anarchy. You, Mr Moneta, you run some private practice, unregistered. - Does thinking require registration? - Yes. If it’s harmful. I’d like to know what the nature of my being here is. Am I accused, a witness, or a suspect? Please, come to the window. Look there. Do you see them? For the police, it’s them that are suspects. We know nothing about them. And you are here, we know everything about you. You are not a suspect. I will say more, you are free and a free person must choose. And that's what it’s all about, for you to make the right choice. And once you make the choice, you will tell us. About Boy, about his accident, a tragic accident... About these four tons of coal... After all, we know that it was Kyziol, who stole it. If you know, what do you want from me... See, you started talking already. Sir, there is a phone call from the committee. Shall I put it through? No, no, I’ll come. I’ll be back in a minute. Maria? I’m very sorry. No. Please tell her that Jozek rang. I’ll call later. Please, don’t mind me. Shall we finish our tea? Please. You see, we want to be honest with you. We want to help you. You are a sensitive man, you observe a lot, you read a lot. It is a pity to waste such a life, to let it disappear into oblivion. Maybe you can write something. So many others try it. You know different environments, important people. I’m sure you’ll succeed. And then we’ll help you to publish it. Well? Maybe you get involved and seriously interested in it. After all, there is so much to tell. You see, we don't want to put obstacles in your way because of some mistakes in the past, in your youth. Well, but youth comes to an end. There will be no more leniency. I have such a nice pen here. Please write. - And this? - No, not this. - What about this one? - No, no. This one! This is good. - Looks like you. - Really? Maybe I find something better. - Miss Marina, excuse me - Well? Will he jump aside? - Not yet. - The sooner, the better. If he won’t jump aside, he’ll lose. Do you need that? I don't know if I need this, I don't know if it's good, I don't know if it’s bad, just give it back to me. Please. You don’t say “give it back”, but “please return it to me”. Is this good? Are you good at art? No, not art. Once, I mistook Matisse for Gauguin, and Watteau for Russ. Do you like the one over there? You see, what we think is good is actually not always good. Sometimes it’s the other way around. - Well, I can’t turn it around. - You have to think. There’s always a lot to change during work. You don't know yet how many things you will give up. What am I to give up? I’ve written it, submitted it and that’s the end. No, that’s not the end, but the beginning. And you haven’t even started yet. But look. It’s like that. I just wanted to express myself, right? - Something from me. - Do you rather not express yourself at all? I understand that you want something different. You just need to know how. In this way you’ll get nowhere. But first of all, you have to start, start calmly. Besides... - You’re hostile. - Me, hostile? Well, I’m sorry. You see, here we have plenty of texts like yours. Different authors come here and everyone has to change something. That’s the procedure and I can’t help it. - Neither can Janusz or Jozek. - I understand. I love you. A beautiful weapon, huh? Now see this one. It’s a double-barrelled... - See, both are threaded. - Yes. All right. Now look at this little beauty. This is a Winchester 1901. It was used for hare hunting, to make sure that you... - I’m back. Hello. - ...get something. Thank you. - Oh, flowers! Lovely bouquet. - Nice, nice. Maria, give us that walnut liquor from the music box. Please. It’s from Kazik. Nice, huh? You see, they are no longer used. Now it's pellet guns. - But maybe I’m boring you? - No, great weapons. Yes, nice. No, not like this. Allow me. Now it’s all right. You parked the car again in the sun. You know that car paint fades. What’s going on here? What did you do with your lips? Why aren’t you in bed? You are not well. I forgot. That’s a cold sore cream. - Mum, Jozek came. - I can see that your friend came. Clear your stuff away. I’m sorry, but you see, I left the car under a tree yesterday and the birds... well you know. What are you talking about? Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Jozef Moneta. Nice to meet you. You are the one who quit the university, right Maria? Mum, take you coat off, Jozek came. I can see it. So what? Maybe that’s not the most appropriate moment, but I came to ask for your daughter’s hand. What’s that? Is this some joke that you young people have thought of? No mum, it’s not a joke. Excuse me, I don’t treat money as a joke. These are 27 tulips at 15 zloty each. 27 tulips because Maria is 27. Unfortunately. What does that mean? And how old are you? Are you aware of the responsibility? You are certainly an intelligent, young, promising man... - I’d like to believe it. - Mum, please. My child, you clear the table first. Really, it's not the right moment to clear the table! You take your stuff, too. Now, go to bed and we’ll talk seriously. Jozef, please. Sit down. I won’t go to bed. Indeed, Maria is 27 years old. You rightly noticed that, but there is no point in rushing. She still has a lot of time. She has many friends and she can make her choice. And you? I’d like to know what your perspectives are? Who are you? What are you doing? I’d like to know that. Actually, I’m a nobody. I'm only sleeping with your daughter and would like to legalize this state. And you came to tell me that? I admire your audacity. This is not audacity. Only, you must be aware of the consequences of this situation. I, for example, personally am against those... artificial miscarriages. - Yes. - You bastard! You idiot! No... This is the height... the height of rudeness! I can’t stand it. Do something! Yes. What? Maybe some tea or coffee? He’s mad! I’m being offended in my own home and he doesn’t even react to it. I’d be grateful if you leave my house immediately! Please, get out! - With pleasure. - Get out! Then watch over your daughter... until she’s old! - Hi. Is Daria in? - Hi. - My name is Moneta. - Wait. Daria, somebody called Moneta for you. - Hi there. - Hi. - Who was that jerk at the door? - Which one? - The one with the beard. - Don’t you know? - Who is he? - Fredek. He should work in a zoo. I brought your bike. - Was it useful? - Yes, love riding it. - Why didn’t you come last time? - Well, this and that, I couldn’t. - You’re staying, huh? - Who is there? No, I’ll go. - Stay. We’ll talk afterwards. - Here it is. - But... - You know... No, no - Who is there? - Staszek has problems. Want to hear? .. dependent on the recipient. And the recipient has always been a politician. But this is again the case. I am talking about all the time, about the problem of the non-scientificity of history. But this is impossible. It’s impossible because every description of something carries the burden of interpretation. Yes, it does, but only if you make a selection. You can’t register facts if you don’t have a way of selecting them. You cannot register all of them at the same time. You have to choose something, whether you like it or not. You can do it subconsciously. You can talk about some process and... spontaneously, without being aware of it, you will choose a set of facts that you think are important. And this selectivity is, in turn, dependent on your mentality and your attitude towards facts. - Yes, of course. - Then it always will be subjective. You cannot create history with a thesis. Because you’d be confronted with a very significant confusion of concepts. Then we start talking about ideology, not history, and while ideology can afford a lack of objectivity, which is obvious because ideology uses some carefully selected facts to prove a thesis, to carry out a thesis; if then the same approach is applied to history, we will have worse facts and we will have better facts... It’s about discarding all theses that do not belong to history. And we always, we always get back to the question of interpretation, to ideology. And why it is important? Here we are, sitting in this place, in this reality, and we’re reaching here and there, always for something... First, contemporary attitudes are created, simply on the basis of the present day, and only then, do they influence our understanding of the past. Hold on. Creating history begins very early. And very early this history starts getting moulded politically. - Yes, of course. - Right. But this is pointless. What kind of awareness? You were talking of awareness... what kind of awareness has a child? Nearly none. Well, no. We come to the point where history ceases to create itself, but we create history. This is an absolute reversal of things. You’ve got something there… - Have you got any cigarettes? - I have, in the drawer. - They are not there. - Here. Here, here. - Your hands are shaking. Why? - I’m upset. - Have you been drinking last night? - No. You have these... you know, under your eyes. - When are you leaving? - I’m leaving. - I’ll come to the station with you. - Don’t. - Well, we’ll see. - We’ll see. But as you wish. So, I’m off. - Bye, Daria. - Bye. Teach us too to fold our fingers, To brace a door on the other side, Of rooms of a love already lost. May what dreamed of happiness And shielded a slender flame When the need arises, form a fist. And after the struggle is ended, Allow us to straighten our fingers, Even if it leaves us only a void, Taking defeat in an open hand. Holding a skull in soft fingers, At that moment you start again, The great cause of open hands, A playful traveling over strings, The ultimate grain of salvation. I repeat: international express train to Paris... Marysia! Marysia, your suitcase! Here is your suitcase Be careful. Watch your passport, all right? - Have you got a good seat? - Yes, very good. Remember, you can eat less for breakfast and dinner, but have a good lunch. - And don't smoke, it’s poison. - I will remember, really. Don't smoke those nasty Gauloises. Honey, call the Potockis straight away. - That afterwards. - I remember, I have it written down. You must go to the Alliance, arrange some Loire tours, watch the castles. And don't smoke those nasty Gauloises, please don’t, no more than ten. - I’ll write, my child - Please, don’t smoke. - No, I’ll call Mariola. - Tomorrow, if there’s a chance. I’ll call Mariola. No, Mum, I’m asking you, please don’t call Mariola. But my child, she’s working at the embassy, she’ll help you. Say goodbye to them and talk to me for a moment. I came here just for that. Maria, please. - Did you take the heater? - Heater? Can you hear what I’m saying to you? Why pretend? Listen to me, Maria... Do you want a thousand apologies? Listen, listen ... We will arrange it all... Darling... Please, I beg you. For the first time in your life you brought yourself to do something to please me. But you don't think it's a bit too late? It is not too late. Please, come here. We'll sort it out somehow... come on... And watch yourself! Bye! - Get off the train! - But you will write? - No, I won’t write. - And I will wait for you. Well, darling... - Watch yourself... - Leave it. Watch out! Remember, I’ll wait for you! Don’t run! Good day! - What a mess you’ve got here. - Mother! - Did you come? - Well, I did. - Funny flat, like an attic. - What are you saying, Mum? - You look thinner, darling… - No Mum. Slim people live longer. - You don’t eat enough. - What are you talking about? - Do you pay something for this? - Only 800 zloty. 800 zloty? For this attic? Is that a lot? Do you know how much a flat in the city is? You see. You don’t know. Come, sit here. Come on. - So? Do you have a steady job? - Steady job? You know, I sit, I write and they even pay me for it. - Will you eat something? - No, I’m not hungry. - So, what? Do you work in an office? - No, in an editorial room. - Wait... - What happened? Oh my! It’s my heart. I told you so many times to go to this doctor. - I did. - Don't lie, I know it's not true. You must start taking care of yourself. - Yes, I have. - Oh, Mum! Couldn't you do all this at home? You would sit, write, read. And you could have a regular, steady job as well. Hold on. And you wouldn’t have to pay for a flat. - Mr Moneta? - Yes. Why didn't you show up? There were supposed to be some corrections, we agreed on that... I understand. Well, I'm very happy, that you liked it. Something new? Well, next week... Around Wednesday. Yes. Money for me? Fine. At the office? Great! Yes, yes, I will shorten that. All right. Thank you. Bye. Well, you see, Mum. I'm slaving away here and you’re complaining. It’s good, Mum, very good. Come on, my boy, we’ll tidy up... Leave it. I have an idea for today. Let’s go to a shop and buy something special for you, all right? - Well, Mum? - You know, I’d like to buy shoes. Brown ones. - Try again. - I can't. I think they’re too small. Indeed, too tight. I'll bring another pair - A half size bigger. - A half size at least. Try these on. A half size bigger. See... They’re all right. But these clips... Well, very nice. Very nice. - I’m so hot. - Wait, I’ll help you. - Something here... - Have you got a girlfriend? - I do. Maria. She is in France. - A bit tight. Is she French? - No, she's on a scholarship. - So what? Will you marry her? I meant to. But my proposal was rejected. - I take this pair. - You do? Right. What are you talking about? What do you... Damn it! You could have come back. And what? You just dug your heals in. - Watch out. - Yeah. You just set your mind on it. So much time has passed. Now... Now things that matter are completely different. - Is that so? So, what matters now? - You know very well. You have to live and not sit quietly and pretend that your hands are clean. Guys, watch out that it doesn’t get scratched! Everything will be all right. It's difficult to get through to you. Of course, you are above all that I say, you despise everything and everyone and you know it. Andrzej, no. The table goes there to the dining room. Oh, Mum, you should’ve said earlier. Just be careful not to mark the walls. And that’s not an attitude. - Are you tired? - No. - You must be. You’re sweating. - Mum... give over. You take care of the books and the workers will bring in the rest. - All right. - Where will you put those books? You should have taken this bookcase from us. And have a junk room here? - Nice flat, isn’t it? - This to the other room. - One can live here. What d’you think? - Well, it’s all right. - What housing coop d’you belong to? - None, so far. Now, you have to wait a long time. You can speed it up, of course. - Dad, give over. - Don’t you complain, because if your dad wouldn’t help you, you wouldn't have it yet. He was with the coop for eight years. And suddenly, it was just as if he’d been crossed out. - So, you better start now. - Mum, could you put the kettle on? - What for? - Well, for some tea. Good thinking. The first tea in the new flat. - Maybe you prefer coffee? - No, thank you. Okay, you take care of the kettle and we get settled down here. You’ve got a nice view from this window. This pipe... Once they clean up, it will be nice. In 15 years. Look, so what of it that you were the best of us all at university? - You lacked resistance and drive. - You've put it nicely. I was depressed, too. Everyone was. Only I went back because my place was there. - And yours as well. - And you did the right thing. Do I hold it against you? - In a way, you do. - That’s no way to talk. Only, I don't really know what are you after. I really don't understand. All those mock gestures, illusions of rebellion... It doesn't lead to anything. - And you know some other way, right? - Tactics. I want to live, do you understand? Here and now. Why should I be a schoolgirl’s hero? I reckon that as an assistant at university, I will do more than you in your own four walls. You think, of course, that I behaved despicably. Did I say anything like that? Your business. I can only I tell you that I can still live with myself. Who cares about your rebellions in that coal yard? Who is interested in that? If all valuable people withdrew from life, you know what would happen? - Well, what? - One great mess, I’m telling you. You’re right there. You left. And that’s, of course, all right. Only that someone else took your place straight away. Do you understand? Someone, who was less clever than you. Someone with no scruples, no inhibitions. You don’t take that into consideration, right? - Come on - No. Remember Rochowicz? Now then, did I bring Rochowicz in? It was lucky that he got promoted, because he lost interest in us. Everyone was looking for you then. I even wrote to your mother. You just vanished. There was a chance for you to return to the faculty. Even the dean agreed. You could just have taken your student record book and it'd have be over. Andrzej, you’re a sensible guy. And you love Maria, right? And what does it matter, whether I love Maria or not? Well, no... nothing. I'm not surprised at all. - Are you still seeing Daria? - No. Well, I do, but rarely. I don’t have the time. She is a teacher. Her life got somehow screwed up, too. You see, I really... I really don't know what it’s like. Such great people like you, whom I value and love, and somehow, they fail in their lives. It's as if you had stopped somewhere halfway through your life. I don’t know, how it is. See, I think that... I think that intelligence is not an abstraction, it is simply an adaptation to specific conditions. But you don't worry, Andrzej, you’ll manage. Let’s get on with these books. I know that you are not sleeping. Darling... Jesus Christ! Hold on, hold on, hold on Wait... Pause... Did I say anything silly last night? - No, what do you mean? - No. Well, nothing happened? - No. - That’s good. Your flat is big, this room... You rearranged this room, - it was somehow different. - It just seems like that. Maybe. There are always a lot of people here. Daria, please, less walking... - Please less walking, sweetie... - I’m stomping, huh? Look, I think you have to go to that school of yours soon. - Not that soon. - That’s great. - I’ll go for the fourth period. - That’s great. So, I’ll sleep a bit longer. - Hey? What are you doing? - What am I doing? - What are you doing? Jozek! - I’m doing nicely. Jozek... What are you doing? - What are you doing? Take a bath! - No. - To the bathroom! - No. - Bathroom, right now! - Ouch! I have to undress to get up. Wait. My head is all wobbly. Do I have to? I do. - For sure? - Absolutely. - What happened? - I’m sorry for popping in like that. Do you want a drink? Come here, come on. Sit here for a while. - Listen... - Yeah? You are not cross, that I... You are not angry that I came here, out of the blue, are you? No, people always come here. Actually, taking a bath is pointless if you’re going to this coal yard. I’m not sure if I’ll go. I’ll see because I have to look for a room today. You can stay here. Aren’t you exaggerating a bit? I was going to rent my father's room anyway. - Then rent it. - Why? Don’t you like it? No, this is a very nice flat. I’d like to have one like it. Nice, nice... Only, somehow it’s not me. Not a happy flat. I have to look for something as well. You know what? I like you. I better make breakfast, all right? That’s how it should be. I like you, you make breakfast and no sex obligations. You know Jozek, you act like you are a tough guy, but that coal business actually gets you down, doesn’t it? When I was doing psychology, I met that guy, his name was Bartek. He was in the third year and was working as a milkman. - So what? - Do you remember him? Do you? He’s got his diploma now and says that he will still deliver milk. He’s a bit nuts, like you. Because, look brother, where will he get a better... Can you hear me? Listen, did you hear what I was saying to you? I’m listening, I really am. Only, I don’t like it when you call me “brother”. Look. Just think. You leave home at 1 a.m., you are back at 4 a.m., and then you have all day to yourself. You can write. I read what you wrote yesterday. - Quite good. - That’s nice. I have smoked maybe 10 or 15 cigarettes in my life. What the hell are you smoking for? Well. Just on special occasions. Okay. Get out. The dressing gown is there. Breakfast? And I’m going to sleep. Daria! - Fuck! They’ll kill me. - What? Who? They’ll kill me. I was supposed to give back 4,000 zloty. - When? - Yesterday. An hour ago, at the latest. - And if you give it back tomorrow? - Then they’ll kill me. - I have some money. - Some... - Shall I lend you some? I have six. - No, no. - All of it? - No. Four. I will definitely give you this money back later. I know. One day. Look! Here is a nice one. Intellect will forgive you everything, it will turn your sorrow into laughter. Intellect explains so beautifully betrayal and lie and sin. Even if you cursed it in despair that it is cruel and wrong, intellect will forgive you everything because intellect that’s us. Hey, what are you doing? - What am I doing? - Stop it… Jozek, what are you doing? What are you doing? Jozek... - Where are you taking me? - What? - Where are we going? - To the end of the hall. Come. Wait here. The forest roars around us... Maybe we sit on these stairs? Come on. Let’s sit. Your fingers are blue, did you trap them in the door? On the metro? Who dressed you up so nicely? You’re losing your personality. We are in Poland, let’s speak Polish. You see, I... I slept with him, not... not because... I wanted to prove something to you, to myself, but because... I left you and that’s what I wanted to tell you today. I hope that he wasn’t black. I brought you something. Be careful. - How do you call this hippopotamus? - Hippopotamus. Now you have to take care of someone. Tough luck. You know... Wait! You know, the worst is that... Listen to me! Listen for a moment! Listen! The worst is that I mean it’s not that things were bad between us all the time, it’s just that you... Are you listening to me? You were happy with it. Jesus Christ... I... See, I know, that you now think the whole time that she left... she left and... that she dared. And now she started... she’s got herself set up. But understand, it’s not like that. It’s not like that. I can’t. I can’t be with someone who is never there. Understand that. You are not by my side, you are not with me. I... I want to have a baby. Understand me… How can I have a baby with you? Moneta! I invite the happy couple to join us. This comrade from the film industry is interested in your text… I heard a lot about you, Mr. Moneta. Your well-known surname is also familiar to me. Yes. My production manager also called you. But I don’t know, either you were not there, or he wasn’t... I can’t remember. Probably I wasn’t in. I’ve just spent two months in a mental hospital. - Something serious? - No, no. The onset of hebephrenic schizophrenia. Yes, we are all a little oversensitive nowadays. You see we’re making a movie about coal workers. A contemporary topic, you understand. We are fed on classics, my dear Sir, those “Quo Vadis” and so on… Yeah. Certainly, down with Quo Vadis, down with it! But, naturally, according to your script. But please tell me, did that Boy really get buried? Is he really dead? - Really. - He was buried, he was. - Couldn’t he have jumped aside? - I don’t know, maybe he could have, but - He could. But he didn’t. - Aha. I understand. In that case, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll do two version to have options, right? Because we do it fast. It’s a semi-documentary method, do you understand? It’s a small camera, little light, like in real life, kind of American cinema, right? - Yes, yes, like conversation. - Conversation? Well, yes. - And what about that Koziol? - Kyziol. You keep in touch with him, right? Because, you know, we are looking for non-professional actors... I don't think you can manage with this Kyziol, because he’s a fictional character. - I understand. Literary fiction, huh? - Yes. It doesn’t matter. Emil will play him. Maybe that’s even better. He’s got this truth in him. What about the dosh? Because I have responsibilities now. - I have to care for a hippopotamus. - No problem. We pay immediately. - How much will it be? - In any case... - Like in the coal yard. - A lot of dosh... But I don’t remember the rates. I’ll get you in touch with my manager, you sort it out it with him. Right, we’ll talk on the phone and maybe everything will be all right. Okay. - Hey! - Hey, hey. - Hello. - You can’t imagine how glad I am that you turned out to be a very sensible boy. - Very kind of you. - My warmest congratulations. - Thank you very much. - One has to have a hobby. This is an old revolver from 1918. Quite an item; because up to 1930 only American policemen had it. - Well, thanks a lot… - It’s a great rest after work. - Please, this way. - I always said that life is life. Youth must sow its wild oats, right? I understand it very well. - Now our Maria will be happy, too. - One changes when one gets married. I'm sorry, not everyone has come yet so please go to the garden. I’ll come in a moment, it’s my uncle. I’m very sorry. - Jozek! Hi! - Hi. Anna and I couldn’t come up with a sensible gift, but I hope you won’t be offended. You’re crazy, that’s a lot. Three thousand? - Listen, great that we’ve met, right? - Great. - Good, you can buy yourself... - Yes, we'll buy a toaster. A toaster would be the best. Or maybe an electric cooker? - Mum, what a beautiful cake! - Isn’t it? I made it myself. With my own hands. I got all messed up… Well, son... Just don’t drink! Mum, what are you on about? Then everything will be fine. And come to see us often. Don’t talk to him like that, he is a grown up! Tea makes you dry, coffee makes you woozy, to hell with that. Well, my boy, be sensible. We can say that it’s the first time we have a “bigwig” in our family. - Jozef! - Mum, this is the Chief Editor. Just a moment, all right? It’s the editor. Sweets for a sweet couple! Well, you see, he jumped aside. He did it finally. Of course, why shouldn’t he jump aside? You see, now everything will go very fast. We’ll send it to the offset printer, that’s about two weeks, the cover in five colours, nice paper. Everything will be fantastic. It’s all arranged. - We, artists... - Excuse me... - Why didn’t Miss Marina come? - She’s on a business trip. But she sends you very, very warm regards. Then, please, thank her. I don't want to interrupt... - Are you going away? - No. In that case, see you on Wednesday, at the team meeting. - All right. - We’ll get the approval and the team. - Remember, it was I who discovered him. - I know. I knew you would get your foot in. Now we have to get you a permanent job with us. - The guys from the coal yard are OK. - Yeah. Well? Isn’t it better here? Coal is not for you. You would go mad. Dear lady, may I ask you do dance? See, you’ve quietened down. Pity. Youth is gone, huh? I was like that once. Hot-headed. But youth comes to an end. I wish you all the best from the depths of my heart. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming. Well, a lot of work, but for friends - always. Forgive me, the guests... - It's not burning. - It will burn with a bright flame. I don't know what to wish you because I don't know what you want. For us to stay friends, right? When is your wedding? Soon, when Andrzej gets his PhD. - Then invite me to the baptism. - Jozek, Daria will be jealous. - Jozek! Come here for a moment. - Excuse me. What happened? - Fuck, they are hassling me again. - Kyziol, I... I can’t stand it any longer! This film guy, or whoever he is, he keeps asking about Boy. But he’s a nice guy! Look, talk to him. Kyziol, I’m asking you. - Just a moment. - Won’t you have a drink with me? I’ll come in a minute. Go, Kyziol, talk to him. Bye. Jozek! Jozek, come here for a moment. - My sincere congratulations. - Thank you very much. I’m glad you decided to finish your studies extramurally. It would be a shame to forgo such a good topic, and such a good student. I also heard that, apparently, you are doing quite well in literature, huh? Well, admit it. Tell me, wouldn't you like to come back to our boring jobs? - Professor... - I’m no longer a dean, long time now. In principle, that’s what I’m most interested in. - Why “in principle"? - Professor... Come back whenever you want! Finally! My best student... Wait, you’ll spill it! All right... You’re invited! Come on, if it falls apart, it will collapse... To the table! Please, to the table! May the star of good fortune shine on them forever more ... Shine on them forever more! And those who won’t drink to their Health, should end up on the floor! Bitter! Bitter! Quiet! Quiet! I like students very much. I was in the Army as well... Red apple rolling on the ground, Don’t just look at me, Look me straight in the eye. Don’t look here and there Though many larks entice you to dare, Though you are tempted by a glow, This, my dear, is just a regular show. Who wrote this? Because next to us and around us A forest, time, a million stars And dwarfs and giants Its chests puffed out above houses The bell of medals tolls from towers Blinding your eyes with a false sun Animal tamers and athletes, A rubber man, a shining star, A fire-eater, a sword swallower God’s servant like a sharp knife, Incense, dream smoke, illusionist, Punter, cyclist and jester tears Twirls, twirls and spins the crowd Pouring vodka gin and rum Red apples empty baskets Flashes in images of funhouse mirrors Twirls, twirls and spins the time So once again and again, Give us power give us the world Or at least a flower A simple flower bud, Put in our mouth, put in our hands Fists on fists, and with these fits We will show... I want that on a summer day On a sultry and hot summer day… Here goes another one… The field of rye is mowed before my eyes I want to hear the sickles whispering And the grasshoppers murmuring low Give him something to drink. And to see with my own eye The cockle-weed mown down in sheaves of wheat. Silence, silence! Quiet! The groom wants to make a toast! - Another recitation? - Please, keep quiet. My dear, lovely guests, I feel I can be honest with you. I'm very glad that so many of you came on this day, that is so important to me. In particular, I’d like to greet those, whose views I didn’t always share and amongst them is my dear uncle... my guardian... the editor... I managed to make friends with you in a short time, and unfortunately... I realized, that it cost me very little. And that you can sell yourself very cheaply. Therefore, it ceased to amuse me, and I would like to say goodbye to all of you. Well, never! I don’t understand any of it. Well? Nobody heard me? I said “Goodbye”! Get out! Get out, damn it! Come here! - What is that?! - It’s outrageous! - I said, let’s go! - As soon as possible! We have five minutes left to the end of the lesson, and we have finished everything. - Two minutes. - Then pack your things quietly. Unless any of you have any questions. Go ahead. No, sit, sit. Well, Sir, we are sitting here, discussing things, talking broadly... But we actually don't learn anything more than what is written in the book. And this we can read at home or see on television. It makes no sense that we sit here and learn nothing more but the program. I don't know if you speak in your own name or on behalf of the class... - Of course! - Let me say something else. You have to understand that there is a certain program, which we have to go through with you here. - Anyhow, we expand some topics... - But this is not the best program and we all know it. You, Sir, as well. You must understand that I did not set up this program. But if you are conveying it to us, it becomes sort of your program. You are undermining my competences, but you have to understand that we all have some duties. Both students and teachers. You, for example, you didn’t take any notes today, you don’t have a pen... Sir, I am not learning with a pen. That’s not an argument. It’s like if I were to hold it against you that you don’t wear a tie. - Leave the classroom! - Well, that's at least an argument. - Who is the class president? - Why? Leave. Teach us too to fold our fingers To brace a door on the other side Of rooms of a love already lost. May what dreamed of happiness And shielded a slender flame When the need arises form a fist What the hell should I talk to him about? They hassle me all the time. And after the struggle is ended Allow us to straighten our fingers Even if it leaves us only a void Taking defeat in an open hand Holding a skull in soft fingers At that moment you start again The great cause of open hands A playful traveling over strings The ultimate grain of salvation.
