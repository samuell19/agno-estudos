He shouldn't lie Should be honest Love me more than anything in the world... Follow my words And he should never look at another girl Your hopes are impossible...

He's a chick magnet He has many girlfriends. All friends with benefits. What's happened to him now? Dean caught her daughter red handed during combined studies with Vicky. Dean expelled Vicky from college What did Vicky do then? He appealed to the legal counsel in our college He has to prove his innocence to the counsel. Today is the day. Vicky's meeting her. Prashanti Reddy Head counselor of the university Age 32... she's very strict. She treats men very low She staff is filled with men She scolds them everyday and satisfies her ego. Please pray for Vicky This guy has a crazy character - No, he's a dangerous character. Excuse me, Miss! English is a funny language The one we're not supposed to miss is called as Miss. Where's the Counselor's office? Thank you. Hey! You speak Telugu? Oh Ego. On April 6th, at 11:30 pm... What were you doing in Dean's daughter Margaret's bed room? I just helped Margaret relieve her stress levels. Stress? Can you explain? Yes, Miss Reddy. Back when you were a student... What would you do to relieve stress during exams? I'd eat a chocolate. Huh! Chocolates would help back in those days But the stress levels now are higher Chocolates and biscuits don't seem to work We need a human touch. - What?! I had the same reaction. But her stress levels were at peaks as it was examination time. She couldn't focus at all. She has exam in the morning. She has to study to clear it. She needs her stress relieved to study. And to relieve stress, I have to... - Huh! I have to help her. Moral values on one hand and Margaret's career on the other. Values or career? Values or career? Values or career? Values or career? Values or career? - What did you decide? To hell with the values! I've decided to help Margaret's career. I stayed there until her stress levels were normal... I did everything she asked for... I also let her take control... She felt really happy. But her mom barged in at the same moment. She didn't feel happy. Miss Reddy I'm not guilty. Please help me. Miss Reddy. Your hands are shivering I can hear your heart beat aloud. You're sweating. I think you're stressed. Do you want a chocolate? No. Miss Reddy? Call me Prashanti. "Is he the grandson of 'Devadasu'? Or the heir of 'Manmadhudu'?" "An epitome of romance? Or quite the charmer?" "He wraps around you like a fragrance" "He doesn't miss a single sigh" "He sets hormones on fire" "Short term boyfriend is his nickname" "Mr. Majnu!" "He's like intoxication" "Mr. Majnu!" "A rugged Greek Lord" "Is he the grandson of 'Devadasu'? Or the heir of 'Manmadhudu'?" "An epitome of romance? Or quite the charmer?"

Can I call you Nikki? It sounds cute. How do you know my name? I managed to get a seat beside you. Finding your name is no big deal. Look Vicky No matter how hard you try, I'll not fall for you.

There's not a single subject you haven't failed. And you went on a date with each and every girl in your college. Okay, thanks. Thanks? For what?

Hey, did you lie? He's Chitti My best friend. Did you lie or not? How do you know that he lied? It's nature's connection. I injure myself every time he lies. - Traffic Jam, Bye. Traffic Jam Fine, I'll meet you later Bye. Let's go. Get the car. - Okay sir. Did you say something to Kishore's sister? Why is she angry on you? - I didn't say anything dad Really? Promise dad, I didn't say anything to her. Vicky! - Be cautious. We are from the Girl's side. Vicky! Vicky! Good morning, love! Hi, auntie... Have some coffee and sleep. Thank you. - Hi bro What did you get for me? Look aunty, she has become very commercial Yes. Go! The whole black suitcase is for you. Wow! - Enjoy. Thank you. Aunty, don't keep any hopes on her or Vinodh I'll be taking care of you later I forgot - Did uncle wake up? No. He told me to inform him once you are awake. Make it fast, guys. Wedding is in less than 20 days. You guys are way behind. Make it fast. Come on! Good morning, uncle. It's 12' o clock. I was home late last night, so Got your masters degree at least? Here's my certificate, uncle. Whoa! You're behind by 2 years Don't you feel embarrassed? Learn from your younger brother. You're talking about Vinodh? - Yes He pursued engineering in IIT. MBA in IIM.. He's an investment banker and earns 5 lakhs per month and you're still at zero. Your father topped in civil engineering and I, in medical entrance. I developed an interest in construction later. But I never neglected studies. Never! Never! Your brother is lecturing Vicky Did he start? You're the only one ridiculing studies in our entire family. Look there sir. I keep telling you the same thing Vicky! - So, what I was telling that... Uncle... Dad You know Kishore's sister right? - Yeah. Nikki... We have to gift her presents as a ritual. So, why don't you take her shopping? Don't hesitate about the price. Why do we have to take that pain We could pay them in cash. Stop giving him suggestions and listen to your father. Bye, dad. - Vinodh would have taken care Very bad behaviour. What? What? Do I have to go shopping with Vicky? Nikki. Don't shout on your dad I'll break your teeth. Don't interfere. Go inside. Okay. I'll go shopping with anyone... Except him. Who are you? Idiot! Sorry... I'm Vicky. Mr. Krishna Prasad's son... Dear Tell your daughter If he heard her scolding him It would be very bad. He's Vicky Krishna Prasad's son. He's here. Coffee - I don't drink coffee. Thank you. Coffee. - Did you prepare? Get some biscuits. - Right now. You had it already? - Yes, I couldn't wait. Even this plant is dead. Dad, I'm ready. Nikki What? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have behaved like that with you. Now that we are family, can we be normal? I'll stay in my limits. No flirting or cheap jokes... I'll do whatever you want me to. I should be home by 6 sharp. - Done. Uma - Hi Nikki Why didn't you come inside? Mom told me I can't come in before marriage. Brother What are you doing here? - Hi bro Bro, manage mom if she asks about me Let's go. - Okay, bye. Hello Excuse me Excuse me - Are you done? Shall we start? I'm not done yet They are ignoring me. Really? Excuse me, miss Sir. Thank you. Madam. Sir, who is she? Relatives. How do you flirt so easily with them? Simple. Sweet lies. I praise them They fall for it. All the girls are not the same Girls have very high expectations from girls They only fall in love when those standards are reached. Then I'll have to tell you the Doberman theory. In a girl's imagination, the boys are like He-Man. But they fall in love with Doberman . Ever noticed? A beautiful girl falls in love with a rough guy. And a studious girl will always falls for a back bencher. Yeah. But why? For the sake of power. Only when guys are inferior to you... You can make them feel they don't deserve you. You remind them every minute that they're just your puppets. A He-Man will ask you to get lost. But a Doberman is different. Very loyal. He acts demure as he fears you'll dump him. Here. What are you thinking about? So I'm hoping to find a man like Lord Rama. Will I ever find such a man? Tell me! Will I find him or not? You might find him. How can we be so sure? Why'd you give me this bloody Doberman theory then? I'm beginning to worry about the kind of man I'll find. What happened? - Leave me alone. Nikki, can I say something? - Hmmm. This morning, you didn't want to come with me. But you did. There was no dinner plan but you had dinner. You had to be home by 6 pm. It's 10 pm and we're still hanging out. Did anything go wrong? No, right? That's how life is, Nikki. Nothing goes as planned. You'll meet your Rama if you're destined. But if you're fated to meet a better guy, Rama is out of the picture. So, don't ask God for what you want. Ask him for what's right for you. Nikki - Hi aunty. Uma Nikki is here.. - - How are you? I'm good. Hey Small gift for you. - Thank you. Where's uncle? Vinod is coming today. He went to pick him up. What? Vinod is coming today? Yeah. You didn't know? - Why would I stay home if I did? I'm so dead I'll bring the luggage Go inside dad. I'm dead. Dead! Vinod's here. Lakshmi he is here. Hey, Nikki When did you come here? - Just now. This is my son Vinod. From Mumbai Hi. - Hi. Mom, how are you? - I'm good, dear. Freshen up. I'll serve lunch. Hey Vicky Vinodh is coming Vicky... Didn't you lose this guy yet? He's my best friend, man. By the way, I heard you finished MS Ya. - So what's next? I'll start going to office after the wedding. Yes You will go It's your dad's office. Dad-gifted car and dad-given money. Let me know when you do something on your own. I can't take this shit, man. Uncle, car is in the sun, I'll keep it under shade. At his age someone created Facebook - Mark Zuckerberg. Very recently he bought WhatsApp. But this guy is still checking his WhatsApp messages Vicky You've got a lot of work outside. What's with all the crap? You go. To hell with her. Are your brains feeling the heat? I'm use to this since childhood. You would be doing great if you studied well. Let's put studies topic away. You should be having some goal in life. Who says I don't have a goal? What is it? - I have to develop dad's company. What was that? Where's your identity in walking in your dad's footsteps? That's what your uncle's been telling you. Nikki, my dad taught me to walk Is it wrong to walk in his footsteps? Do I have to dream big? Isn't it enough to take his dreams forward? I'm not there without my father. That's true. He's my strength. But I'll be my dad's strength someday. That's more satisfying for me. I don't have to invent Facebook or buy WhatsApp. Nikki Your brother smokes and I hate it. Except for that, Kishore is a sweetheart. He's a ladies man for sure. You might not like that. But, he is a gentleman. You will understand slowly Let's go. You guys carry on Vicky will drop me. Okay thanks. - Okay. Hi Vicky Hey How are you? I'm good Meet my Would-be Vamsi. Congratulations. - Thank you. When are you getting married? - September. Shall we go? Where's Uma? - She went with my brother. Vicky Who is she? She's my relative. Who is she? - My Ex girlfriend. What? Vicky Are you friendly with all of your exes? Yeah. Even if they have a boyfriend now? Some of them are also married. Aren't you jealous of them? Not all girls in the world are born for me, Nikki. They have a life of their own. And I respect that. But not everyone is like you, Vicky. Sushma was very jealous to see us together. What? - Yeah. She thinks I am your girlfriend. I could see it on her face. If someone cries for me, it's not my fault. But if I'm the reason someone cries... It's definitely my fault. And I'll never make that mistake. God, Vicky! You're making me jealous. You're the happiest person I've ever met. Have you ever been sad in your life? No. Seriously? You never cried? No. When you hurt yourself as a kid or broke one of your toys. I'd apply ointment if I hurt myself. Buy a new toy in case I broke one. Not even when your mother died? Sorry. I was 3 hours old when my mom passed away. Everyone must have cried when she died. I must have too. I don't know. Don't you miss your mom? My dad never let me feel so. Chitti! Come. - Coming. Hi aunty Hi Nikki - Where's Uma aunty? She went to give invitations to her friends. She'll be back in 15 minutes Sit in her room. Okay, aunty. - Okay. What's your problem? - Hey stop it! Why are you beating him? - I've been packing them since morning. I asked for help and he called me jobless, acting all sarcastic. How dare you hit me! I'll tell Dad. - Get lost. Your uncle will be serious on you. - That's fine. Dad Dad Hey, Shiva Prasad! Where are you? Shiva Prasad! Where is Shiva Prasad? Shiva Prasad! - Sir. Mr Reddy What happened? Are you planning to ever pay me back? Sir, please Sir, listen to me. Guests are home, sir. - Didn't you know while borrowing money? Didn't you know that, huh? You have to return the money. - I can't return as of now. It's kind of hard. Didn't you know while borrowing money? Let's sit and talk. I didn't come here to sit and talk. Answer me! - Take your hands off him. Do you know who you're talking to? Let's sit and talk. Your brother's taken a loan of 25 crores with interest. He hasn't paid me in 6 months. He stopped coming to office since 3 months. He doesn't respond to my calls. What do I do? It's true that I borrowed money from him. I constructed a layout in Timmapur. As the market is in crisis... Project sales are down. I couldn't pay him back in time. Fine. There's a wedding in our family. He can't pay you now. I know this is the right time to demand my money. I'm not leaving without my money. Sir. Give me 3 months time. I'll give you the money. Not possible! Sir It's my daughter's wedding. I'll lose my respect. Hey. I don't trust you I'll sign wherever you want me to. What are you talking? It's okay. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Hey! Bring the papers. - Boss. Okay, boss. Hey, they're empty sheets. It's okay, brother. Ask your son to sign as well. Why do you need his signature? What if you put IP? What if you die? Who'll pay me? Tell him to sign. Son Sign. I can't, dad. It's okay. I'll take care of everything. Nothing will happen. What if you can't take care of everything? This is too much pressure for me. I don't know what tomorrow holds . So, don't drag me into this. And it's not fair of you to make me pay for your mistakes. Vinod. Sorry uncle. Not even your son trusts you. How can I? Don't drag kids into this. Are you fine with me signing it? Mr. Krishna Prasad's assurance is more than I can ask for. Is your son going to sign? I wish Shiva Prasad shouldn't pay the money. I can loot this house through some litigation. Make it quick! Hey Open the gate. I can't do it. He has the keys. You guys are so full of it. Can't you work properly? Come on! Go bring the keys. He looks very angry, sir. He might hit you. Hey Go bring the keys. - Okay, boss. Hey! Where's the DJ? Ask him to come quick. Why is he so late? Call him! - Okay sir. Hey. I already told you That he is angry and he might hit you. You shouldn't have messed with him. What are you looking at? Finish your work. Hey. Bring the keys. - Okay. Put him down and bring the keys. Hey, useless fellows! You stepped on the plants. Uncle, how long do we need to replace these? We need quite a few hours, sir. Couldn't you watch out? Huh? You ruined all the plants. - Leave me!! You should be careful, right? 'I'm not leaving without the money.' Hey, don't hit me! I'm a big rowdy back in Kadapa. Let's sit and talk. Wait. Don't hit me. Wait. Wait! Let's talk. Wait! Please! Ma'am... Shiva hasn't eaten anything since morning. Get him some fruits. We just made an agreement. Why are you hitting me? What will you go tell people about this? You'll say went to Shiva Prasad's house... Demanded your money... And scared the hell out of him. What will you tell them now? You threatened Mr. Shiva Prasad for money... And his elder son beat the hell out of you. Tell them that, okay? Yeah. Let's go. - Let's get out here quietly. Are you out of your mind? You can't mess with those goons when the wedding is near? My dad should be blamed for this. Not you. Has he ever been stable throughout his life? He failed as a doctor at first. And now as a businessman. That bloody old man! Hey! How dare you hit me? Let me tell dad about this. Back when you were in 9th grade I guess.. You had viral fever. You remember? No medicines worked on you. Best doctors in the city treated you. They have lost hope. Except for one doctor... Doctor Shiva Prasad Rao. My uncle...! He used all his knowledge on you. He spent all day and night taking care of you. He'd spend sleepless nights. You finally recovered. Doctors called it a medical miracle. Rest said God saved you. And you called that God a bloody old man today. Uncle never held a stethoscope again after that. He promised God that day. if you lived He'd quit his loving profession. He left it. For you. You couldn't sign a goddamn paper when your dad was in trouble. He held your hand and taught you to walk. But you let go of his hand today. Sister can't know about this. I won't tell her. Thanks. What are you doing here? The guests are here They are asking for you. I thought he was my world. But today... All of a sudden... He pushed me into void. Don't say that, dear. I'm not angry with him. I'm just sad that I lost his trust. I don't wish to live. - Stop it, dear.

I brought her here to introduce you. Where is she? Suha One second. Vicky! - You guys know each other? You guys already know each other? He's already been with her. Chitti Chitti - Chitti is angry. You'll have ice cream? Vicky is always like this, Chitti. He goes over the top sometimes. Is it? Please don't say that about him. He's my friend. I mean to say... It's not his fault. My fate just screwed me. It's a coincidence. Vicky is really lucky to have a friend like you. Not at all. I'm lucky to have a friend like him. Do you know driver Ranga? Hello... Show some respect. Your friend calls him uncle. He's my dad. Your dad?! My dad has been his dad's driver since 20 years I know Vicky since we were kids. We're best friends. Just like he introduced me to his dad as his best friend when we were kids... He still introduces me to his new circle as Chitti, his best friend. That's how he is, Nikki. When he considers someone special He dedicates his life to them. Why is he different when it comes to girls? That's not his fault, Nikki. Every girl that comes to him wants him as her boyfriend. None of them want him to be the only one. But the day a girl wants him and him only... Mark my words. He'll fight for her. Stand for her. He'll carry her around like a princess. Mark my words.

Okay, right? Why are you angry with me when it's the DJ's fault? Why'd you say we have nothing going on? Because, that's the truth. What do I have to do to make you love me? Tell me. What do I have to do to make you love me? Do I have to laugh at your lame jokes? Do I have to deck myself with make up? Or do I have to dress in skirts and walk the ramp? Tell me Tell me!

I will kiss you. Not when you ask for it. But when I feel like it. Hmm. Okay. This is my favourite doll. Cinderella. Keep it. Why are you giving it to me? My favourite doll should be with the person I love. At least when you look at the doll, you should think of me. Don't look at me like that. Off late, you haven't been spending time with me, Vicky. We've been meeting every day, right? That's not enough for me. I want to spend more time with you. You should always keep this. Sunny Leone! Mia Khalifa! Wow! Quite a collection you've got here. Internet will be ashamed. Hey! What are you doing? You're a lover boy now, playing with cute dolls. I'm shifting these hot dolls to my room. Stop it! What's wrong? I'm planning my whole week around this. Hey, I said stop it! Have you got the new one? I said stop it! We're in trouble, man. - What have I done? It fell on the floor by itself. - Uh-huh? Are you saying it committed suicide? Even Supreme Court Judge won't believe you. Forget Nikki. Vicky! I didn't do it, Nikki. It was him. I didn't do it. Get lost! Nikki, it was accidental. Why would I do it on purpose? I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? You mean? Am I forcing things on to you? Because I broke the doll? It's not just about the doll, Vicky. Everything. You don't appreciate anything I do for you. You don't even throw me a compliment. Forget all that. Have you ever taken me out on a date? I'll only call you from tomorrow. And I'll compliment you every day. Let's go on a date tomorrow itself. Don't do it because I asked you. Do it when you feel like it, Vicky. I'm returning to London in 2 days. We might not meet after that. - Shit! Your brother! Huh? Where? - Over there. Excuse me... - Sir! Hide! We were almost caught. What if your brother saw us? My family will get us married immediately. Even I want to get married. He always says this. - I'm getting it, mom. Have it, I say. - Dad, one more? It's delicious. Vicky! - Huh? Want some chicken? - No. Mutton? - Maybe later. Fish? - I'm allergic to it. He won't eat anything. No one noticed. Take it easy. Brother-in-law... - Huh? Find an alliance for Nikki too. We can have her married soon. My responsibility will be fulfilled. Better. - Hmm. Do it soon, uncle. If she's married, I'll convert her room into my wardrobe. If you do that, once I'm married... I'll turn your room in your house into my wardrobe . How come? Obviously... I'll live in your house... Act normal. Everyone's looking at you. Hey Vicky What are you doing here? Nothing much. What's wrong? Nikki will be leaving in 2 days. No more fun at home. We are going to miss her. You know Vicky... Our family flourished after Nikki was born. She's our lucky charm. That's why everyone in the family comes after her. Even your sister would come after mine. Have a place for her in your heart. Not in the car's trunk. Brother-in-law, that day... - Relax. I know everything. You make a good couple. You never told me... Nikki called just now... Your parents agreed for the wedding. What happened? Are you crazy? What are you talking? If I still don't talk about this I'll really go mad. What's your problem actually? Not just one. When I'm with her, I feel so suffocated. She wants everything to happen on her terms. From the film we watch to the clothes I wear... From the food we eat to the haircut I need to get... She doesn't let me sleep at all. Calling and texting me off the hook. I feel like throwing the phone away and hiding somewhere. Why is she controlling me? I'm not a bloody Doberman. Hey, please calm down. She gets me a cake once a week saying happy anniversary. Would anyone in their senses celebrate a weekly anniversary? I can't even look at a girl by mistake. She asks if she's bothering me. And talks about marriage the very next minute. When you've got so many issues Why'd you get your parents involved? I did that? You think I did that? The very next day after I asked her not to tell anyone... She directly came in to my bedroom. She acts way too close with me in front of our families. She throws indirect hints and blushes. Why wouldn't they have a doubt? Think about it once, man. Nikki is a really nice girl. She'll be a great wife to you. I can't even think of her as my girlfriend. Forget about being my wife. I didn't even kiss her until now. Don't talk about love. These are all pretty common in a relationship. You're new to a relationship. That is why you are confused. But remember one thing. A girl's life and two families' equation depend on your word. Come on Let's have a grand wedding, sister-in-law. They knew each other in London... - Is it? So he planned everything in London before meeting us... Come... Come... You've ended up being a silent killer, huh? You have let things escalate. Why are you walking so slowly now? Your brother is quite a charmer, dear. He managed to impress Nikki. - But I couldn't impress him, dad. Vicky doesn't need me Leave it. Vicky, this is what you wanted, right? Do you feel okay now? Is the suffocation relieved? Nikki What happened? Please dad Let me talk. What's your problem with me, Vicky? I call and text you way too much. I want you to change according to my taste. And I act possessive. Is that it? None of this feels wrong to me. Because in this relationship I thought you were my boyfriend. But you considered me an obligation. I thought you changed out of love for me. But I realised now that you were uncomfortable. But I wanted to be the only girl in your heart. How can you say that's wrong, Vicky? Every second spent with you was a celebration to me Is it madness, wanting to celebrate once a week? I agree that I couldn't notice you were uncomfortable. But, how could you not notice my love? Yes! We had a deal. We shouldn't tell anyone. And I broke it. Sorry about that. But I love you beyond inhibitions. I'm helpless. I might not give you everything you expected. If that's how my love is justified... I don't want a love like that, Vicky. You know, Vicky? I asked God to give me the right man But after realizing you're not the one... I'm much angrier with God than you. 2 months have ended. Now you're free. I'm crying at this moment, Vicky. I wonder if it's for you or because of you. 'Vicky doesn't want me, dad.' 'Every girl you've ever been with, acted according to you.' 'For the first time, a girl wants you to match her preferences.' 'That is why you're so confused.' 'Is the suffocation relieved?' 'These are all pretty common in a relationship.' 'You're new to a relationship.' 'Two months have ended, Vicky.' 'You're free now.' Vicky Vicky, wake up. Isn't late for office? Make it fast. Take shower and get ready. Dad Dear Did you pack everything? We'll start in 10 minutes. Vicky JLL employees wanted brochures. Send them. Vicky Come have breakfast. Good morning Hi bro... Come have breakfast. Make it quick. I have to go to office. Dosa tastes good. Have one more. No, mom. Just serve me another idli. Come on! Eat properly. Vicky, I'm going to work. Come fast. Bye. Vicky Vicky, drop Uma at her in-laws place on your way to work. Brother. "I wonder what happened" "Why do my lips act mute?" "I wonder what happened" "Why does my heart feel burdened?" "Like a sky void of stars" "Like a cloud empty of rain drops" "This is quite strange" "I have no idea where I'm headed" "This is quite strange" "I wish I knew where our hearts stand" "I wonder what happened Why do my lips act mute?" "I wonder what happened Why does my heart feel burdened?" "A deep agony with no detail" "A trauma that is unshared" "Have I made the mistake of letting her go?" "No matter who come and go" "Smiles fade away at farewell" "No relation has ever hit me this hard" "I live the way you love the most" "I can't name the reasons why" "I didn't realize I've changed so much" Vicky I was talking to Uma She's pregnant. You will be an uncle soon. "Like the moment time denies to pass" "Like the yesterday that refuses to return" "This is quite strange" "I have no idea where I'm headed" "This is quite strange" "I wish I knew where our hearts stand" You're really not angry with me? You're still here? How you are talking to me normally? - Come inside. You told me every one comes after her. I made her cry. Are you seriously not angry with me? Vicky, if you had really lied to Nikki and cheated her... I would've killed you. Nikki expected something from you but you couldn't give it to her So, she got hurt and went away. It's not your mistake. But I don't feel the same. Since she left, I feel so empty. I feel like my heart's torn apart. That's how heartbreak feels, Vicky. Breakups aren't a new thing to me. I didn't say breakup, Vicky. I said heartbreak. You must have had so many girlfriends. But did you ever listen to any one of them? Did you change for them? Did you put up with their anger? Did you miss any one of their presence? So You didn't love any one of them. How will you feel heartbreak then? You will feel heartbreak only when you miss the person you love. That means I love... Good night. Vicky I don't see him around. He went on a holiday. Holiday? Why all of a sudden? Why not? Which country did he go to? I won't tell you. I'm very happy for you. All the best. Kill it man! Thanks. Call me after you reach. Vicky - Yes dad Have you landed safely? Just now. Still at the airport. Okay. My friend's son is staying in that city. He is a film distributor. You can stay with him. - Why, dad? I'm not new to the city, I'll manage. Things were different back in the past Trust me He'll be helpful to you.. Okay. What's his name? Pulla Rao... Pulla? - It's Pulla Rao. Is it Krishna Prasad on the line? Uncle, dad told me everything Vicky's time with Pulla Rao will be great. Okay? Bye. Shall we go? - Give me 2 minutes. I'm waiting for a delivery. Okay. Where the hell is he? Okay, I got it. Shall we move? Is that an iPhone? - It's a copy of Saho. It's finally releasing? We're releasing it here as they're taking too long. Do you distribute Telugu films too? Of course. I do around 70-80 Telugu films every year. Producers Dil Raju and Allu Aravind we release their movies also Let's go - Who are you bro? Morning, guys! Good morning sir. - Morning sir. Oh! You run a piracy business? - Yes. We loot the rich producers and distributors To those who're lazy to watch a movie in theater And to those misers who wouldn't buy a ticket... We show them movies for free. Isn't it, guys? - Yes. Who do you think is wrong? The thief or the people who buy stolen stuff? You have your business and I have my problems. Okay. Do you have the girl's address? Okay. You get ready. I'll take you there. I'm ready. Let's go. Wash your face at least. Ready! Let's go. You look very desperate. Enter the address. 'You have arrived at your destination.' Don't be in a hurry. Do it calmly. 'You have arrived at your destination.' This seems like a fake piece. Get down. - Why? Just get down. I'll tell you. What happened, bro? - That's the address you're looking for. This house? - Yeah. That's the house. Pulla Rao, I love you! I love you, man! - Hey, stop it! Are you here for Nikki? - Yes. That makes you... Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Where the hell is he? I'll kill him. Where is he? - Vicky! Who's the guy? Where is he? Where is he? - What is this, bro? Everyone in this colony loves Nikki She came crying from India and told them everything So, all of them have deep hatred for Vicky. He is Ramesh, Nikki's uncle. What the hell? Why did I have to hear that name? Nikki shouted his name. They will kill you once they find out. Is that him? I don't know him, uncle. Mr. Ramesh, this is Krishna. My relative's son... He's visiting me from India. Why'd you say Vicky, dear? I was lost in thoughts, uncle. I didn't say that to him. Give it to me. Sir! Sir! Please don't cry like that. You look really bad. I meant to say... We can't see you like that. Sorry, I acted a little angry. Did I bother you? - Nothing like that, sir. I was actually surprised to see so many Telugu people at once. Are you in London for the first time? - Yes sir. I've been worried since I boarded the flight... I love Indian food. And Pulla Rao can't cook at all. I've been thinking about what to do. Come on, man! Have lunch at our place tomorrow. I can't deny your sweet request. Krishna, you don't even know the man's name yet. You wait, Pulla Rao! What's in a name? I'm Ramesh. - Krishna. This is my brother's daughter Nikki. Hi! - She's a sweetheart. Dear Come... Let's go inside. This is my wife, Shanti. - Hello. Hi! This is Krishna. Pulla Rao's relative... - Oh! He came to London today. - So cute. What's his name? - Konda Babu... Konda Babu. - He told them. He embarrassed me yet again. Oh, shit! Everyone's laughing. What kind of a name is that? Ask him that, uncle. I'm dying out of shame. It doesn't sound like a name. Sounds more like a curse word. That's my grandfather's name. Oh, okay If you love grandpa so much, hang his pictures in the hall. Naming your kid after him is suicide. Everyone's laughing at me, dad. This is Konda Babu. My sweetheart My little munchkin... You don't have to say my name so many times, mom. Okay then. See you at lunch tomorrow. - Bye. Bye. Nikki Call me if you need anything, I'll come. Hi Nikki How are you? Why'd you come to London? I'm really sorry Nikki. I hurt you a lot. I really love you. I really mean it. And I want you back in my life. Vicky Do you know how many times I told I love you in India? Don't count. I've told you many times. Do you know how many times you've said it back? Don't think about it. Not even once. Go away, Vicky! Nikki, please! What? You said you loved me the other day. But I was in confusion. I told you I love you today. But you're angry with me. But I agreed when you wanted to work on our relationship for 2 months. I'm asking you for your time now. Give me my two months. Why? I'll make you fall in love with me again. Vicky! You were confused back then. But I have great clarity now I don't want you! So no matter how hard you try My answer to you will be no. Okay. You stick to that. I'll try to change that. What if my uncle found out you're Vicky? So, he's Vicky. If you wanted to, you would've told him by now. You wouldn't have lied. Nasty fellow! He's emotionally blackmailing my sister. Let's try this for 2 months. If we love each other, let's tell everyone. Or else... Nah! You'll fall in love with me. He is following her. Where are you following her, man? Stop! Hey, Vicky! Stop! I'll not spare you even if sister does. I'll chop you into pieces and dedicate to POGO channel. This is for you. Take it. What's with the formalities, dear? You don't have to be so formal, Krishna. Gifts, dear. She is not leaving anything behind. Don't do that. Where is Konda Babu? There he is. Hey Konda Why is he here? Did they become friends already? Keep it. - I bought gifts for you, too. What the hell did you bring me, huh? Let me trouble you right now. Dad! Dad! He's only Vicky. Kill him! Mom! Mom, look. Forget about the gifts. Look at me. Hey! Hey! Don't take it. - Take it. You shameless brat! Why'd you take it? It's all right. Gifts have nothing to do with revenge Put them inside Shanti - Hi. Small gift for you! Sorry! We aren't so close to exchange gifts yet.. Excuse me.. Well done, sister! You've proved at least one of us is sensible. Try this. It's very tasty - Enough. Have some, Pulla Rao. You can't fault my wife's lentils broth. That's what all husbands say in front of guests. Pulla Rao! If you repeat this - Sorry Serve fish to him. No, uncle. Vicky is allergic to fish. Sister! Also tell dad he's Vicky. He'll feed him Apollo fish to die. My name's Krishna. Right, Nikki? Hey! - Nikki Who's Vicky, sir? He's a idiot. He's a rogue who plays with girls' lives. Let me just find him. 'Who is Vicky, sir?' You didn't have to mess with him. Don't just look at me. Imagine yourself instead of the meat. Vicky! - What? Go You forgot this. That's for you. I don't want it. Even I don't want it. I don't want it too. Okay. I don't want it back. Yes! Nikki, please open it. Happy anniversary! It's been 100 days since you said you love me. This is the 15th week. Feels bad, huh? Nah! I get it. I get how much I hurt you back then. Nikki, please I put in a lot of effort to glue it back. But I still see the cracks. Be it a heart or a doll, it's the same, Vicky. Once broken, you can't bring it back to life. No matter how hard you try, they aren't the same as before. They never become what they once were. You should have smashed the doll double hard this time. You can't be too kind to him, Nikki. Forget it, Linda. Good morning, students! Here are your models. You'll be doing a photo shoot with them. Look models are here. This is Daniel. He is Steve And Vicky from India. So, you can pick your model for the photo shoot. Wow. He's hot. Hi Vicky - Hi Vicky Hi Vicky - Hi Vicky He's cute. I want Vicky. I want Vicky. I asked first. I want him. Silence, girls! I'm going to decide who picks who. Nikki God is for real. So, how will you utilize my services? Just a photo shoot or are you interested in casting couch as well? What happened? You're lucky that we cast you. Don't have any expectations for the couch. Hey Nikki I'm late So sorry Basically I left the camera, and I had to get a train, and from the train to the bus... And from the bus to the taxi... - Let her breathe, man! Excuse me? Go wait inside. We'll come to you. Cool man. What are you trying to do? I'm guarding you So that no one hits on you. Darn! - Hey! Nikki - Get lost One photo Nikki listen to me Nikki, one minute - Vicky! Bob? - What are you doing here? Guys, pack your bags. The playboy is in town. - Bob One glance at a girl and she falls into his arms. Bob, please You're of another level, man. Who is your next prey? You acted all decent when we hit on you this morning. You finally got laid with him, huh? You look innocent but you're quite open to things. Stop! Why are you trying to hit him? This is the respect I receive for being with you. Let's go. So hot man! One more beer? No, I'm good. I'll have another beer. - I think his girl is calling. Come on, boys! What the hell you are doing with this guy? He was just asking about the summer class. How dare are you talk to my girlfriend? How dare you talk ill of my girlfriend then? Oh my God! Hey! What the... Do you want to fight? Is it okay? Is it okay? Why do you let him hit you? You should hit him back. A guy's character doesn't lie in the number of girls he's been with. It lies in the respect he shows for a girl. You're no good in respecting other girls Respect your girlfriend at least. Did you have to do this? I was guarding you. Not just you. Your respect as well... What's this bro? Bahubali-3 movie? It's an advanced nanotech camera Record a video with this and you can't differentiate with the original. Hi - Hi Sanjay, waiting for you. He? - He's carrying sweets and fruits. Who is he? I don't know. - Is Nikki ready? Why should Nikki get ready for him? I have a doubt, bro. Am I this house's owner or that house's watchman? Mr Rama Rao, who was that guy that visited Nikki's? Yeah. It's an alliance for Nikki. Alliance? - Some guy was coming. Is he here? Looks like shit. - You only asked me. How long have you been in Dubai? - We've been settled there for 15 years. Hi. - Hi Krishna. He's here. Why did you come now? I ran short of coffee powder. I was thinking if you could lend some. Desperate fellow! Come on, Krishna! Have a coffee and go. Shanti ! - I think you have guests over. We'll go. Okay. - Wait. Don't be so formal, Krishna. This is Sanjay. He's here to meet Nikki. Oh! To meet our Nikki? By the way, he's done MBA from Harvard. In fact, his family has tea estates in Dubai. So Nikki Your uncle told me about your past Frankly, everyone has their past When I was pursuing MBA in Harvard, my Psychology professor told me. If our past is like a ghost, build our future like a temple. Wow. You're the ghost. He's the God in her temple. Google quotations! What Nikki? - Your wish uncle. That's good. Dad will be coming back next month. We'll discuss the rest later. Sure. Hey! Why do you look so dull? Sanjay looks good, huh? Looks like a darker version of Sanjay Dutt. So... Back to India, huh? - Do you have a boyfriend? Of course. - Good-ridden he dumps you. Jealous guy. Wait Looks like they almost confirmed an alliance What can I do when everyone is happy. Bring that guy. Let's party. Either you should drink or beat the guy who is marrying your lover But why are you guys drinking together? I'll tell you. Sanjay Let's drink one peg. No man, only scotch Bihar scotch bro Very famous and strong Okay. Cheers! - Cheers! Bro I'll ask you a favour but don't take it in a wrong way Ask bro He'll request you to leave Nikki heard your dad is a big shot in Dubai. Can you help me settle down? Sorry, bro. Dad doesn't recommend anyone. You're well settled here. Why don't you help me out? Sorry, bro. Jobs are quite tough to find in my line of work. Please? Sorry bro. There's a paper in your pocket. Read it aloud. - In my pocket? Whoa! When did you put it? I told you already, Krishna. - Read it properly. NTR's voice... I told you already, Krishna. This is how rich kids are. They use us poor to their advantage. But they don't return the favour. Oh, I need to say it three times. They don't return the favour! They don't return the favour! It's not like that, bro. Flip the paper. - We don't have jobs for people like you ANR's voice... Krishna, he's denying your request not out of intoxication... But out of arrogance from being rich. You're making me angry. How could you believe in him blindly, Krishna? Only God can save you now. Have you got a matchbox? Just read the paper. Stop it boss. What did you say? This is why I hate the rich, Krishna. Bloody hell! Hand me that knife, Krishna. Hand it to me! What the hell are you saying, huh? - Cool down... Cool down. - Who the hell is rich here, huh? Your father? He's a taxi driver in Dubai. I drive a taxi here. That's my taxi car out there. What about Harvard and tea estate in Dubai? Everyone lies on these marriage websites. No one's asking for the certificates. Oh! I told you Bro! Please don't tell anyone. - Okay. Keep this a secret and I'll set a great girl for you. - Okay. Please, bro Save me. - Okay, okay Love you, bro. You promised me, huh. You too. Promise bro. Please bro. Good night. Thank you. He looks like a bigger loafer than me. I feel so shaken. That was a blind shot, right? - He let his tongue slip this morning. 'When I was pursuing MBA in Harvard, my Psychology professor told me.' How can MBA have Psychology, bro? 'His family has tea estates in Dubai.' Dubai is such a barren land. How can someone harvest tea there? Whoa, you're right. Let's go tell them. They must be asleep. Let's tell them tomorrow. Ramesh should be beaten up for bringing such an alliance. No, bro. That's not right. - You're being too kind, man. Forget it. What's the plan? I'll tell you later. What happened bro? I can't find the camera I bought yesterday, sire. Oh... By the way, what's up with Sanjay? I will kill you! Stop there! - What are you doing? How dare you cheat me! Please stop. Please listen to me... Don't get serious. Mr Ramesh cool down - I'll kill you! What did he do? You're behind this, right? What did he do? Oh my camera! Bloody hell! Give me the knife. Who said I am rich? Your father? He's a taxi driver in Dubai. I drive a taxi here. That's my taxi car out there. What about Harvard and tea estate in Dubai? Everyone lies on these marriage websites. No one's asking for the certificates. Thank you for saving Nikki Calm down. Now it's my turn. Why are you beating me? Why are you beating me? Ramesh should be beaten up for bringing such an alliance. Don't talk like that. You didn't edit it? I forgot. You'll beat me? How can I beat you sir? Mind your words. - Come inside. Your dad said you're coming and said take care. I thought he asked me to take good care of you. I didn't know he asked me to take care of myself. Thanks. Sorry bro. - Enough. If your angry on me, then show it on me. Where is Vicky? - Oh my God! Wait there. He's over there. Behind you. Hey! Stop it, Linda! Are you out of your mind? Let go, Nikki. I have to kill him. - But why? My boyfriend dumped me. Really? - Don't laugh Cool. Cool. It's all because of you. Wait! Let me tell everyone you're Vicky. It's my duty to bring you two together Okay? How? His longest relationship has been for around 2 months And he's set to revive a 7 year old relationship. Jesus Christ. 7 year old relationship... We've been living together since 5 years I'd make coffee for her every morning I'd hug her before going to work Take her out on a candle light dinner on Saturdays. This used to be our routine. What went wrong? I don't feel like doing any of this since 6 months. Because she doesn't appreciate anything I do We're fighting more often... And I don't even care to apologize. Basically, the magic is gone, bro. Don't be stupid, Linda. If you don't want to make coffee, it's okay. Make tea instead. - What?! Make juice for her otherwise. Give her a kiss if you don't want to hug her. Take her to a pub instead of Candle night dinner. Have fun! If your way of expressing love isn't right Find new ways, bro. But you can't dump the girl you love. You loved her the way you like until now. Love her the way she likes from now on. Magic doesn't weave in the air. Man should create it. Never hesitate to do something for your girl. And never forget everything she does for you. Thank her once in a while if possible. You wouldn't find the need to apologise then. Thank you so much, Linda. Thank you. For putting up with me... It's okay, darling. - Thank you. Hey bro What's your name? - Vicky You mean Nikki's Vicky? Hey, Nikki... He seems like a really nice guy. Yeah, he's so sweet. Marry him already.

Does Nikki know you two are relatives? I didn't know until Pulla Rao told me. How would Nikki know? Oh - Oh Is it? He got caught. Krishna is a really nice guy, brother. He's nothing like Pulla Rao. Actually Nikki has changed a lot since Krishna came. He made her forget Vicky and get back to normal. He's a miracle, bro. I have full clarity now. Yay! Movie has reached the climax now. So So, Nikki doesn't know who Krishna is. No! - You introduced him to Nikki? Yes. Introduce him to us as well. - Okay. What a twist! Krishna, that's my brother and his wife. Brother and sister-in-law, he's Krishna. My dad gave me a name meaning robust. But he is viewed by everyone as vigorous. Thank you. Krishna is a nice guy, brother. Dear, coffee. Oh... You made it? - Hmm. In such a short time, he grew closer to everyone. I was thinking that he's the perfect man for Nikki. Do what you feel is right. I have full confidence in your decision. Thank you. What just happened? God! Bless me with the voice I can't take this torture anymore. Guys, I'm going to India for 10 days. It's my friend's wedding. By the time I'm back, make sure piracy market is blooming. Is it okay? - Okay, captain. Whose marriage is it, bro? - Yours, dear. Mine? - Yeah. I just heard the public talk. Everyone has decided on your marriage with Nikki. I heard Nikki had agreed too. Really? - Yes. Thank you bro. Even if you shout your name out loud, no one can trouble you. Correct. Pulla Rao is right, Vicky. No one can trouble you. Not just today. Even if they knew the very first day you came... They would've done nothing to you. That's because you work your charm in a split second. You make everyone fall in love with you. You impressed me. Everyone else is not a big task. Vicky, you came here for me. You acted the way I like. You tolerated all my anger. But I loved you before you did any of this. And I'll continue to love you even if you do none of this. But, I don't want you, Vicky. I don't want you. That's because you don't love me, Vicky. You just assume you love me. I'm the first girl in your life who's hurt by you. That guilt is hurting you. This is sheer guilt, Vicky. Not love. Don't get confused. Do you really think I don't love you? Look into my eyes and tell me. No, Vicky. That's because I've never heard any truth from you. Even now, you're growing closer to me with a lie. I don't trust you, Vicky. If you leave right now, I'll cry my eyes out for 10 days. I'll move on! But if I have to stay with you... I'll doubt if you love me or not. I'll fear that you might leave me. I'd have to live with that. I don't want such a life. Because I don't want to beg for your love. Please leave! Please Nikki Please Please - Please, Vicky. Let go. I'll leave. Let me go, Vicky. Please! No. - Please. No Nikki Go away, Vicky! "Are we bidding adieu to each other?" "Are we letting go of so called love?" "My heart doesn't get to hear from you again" "Yet, it is true that you fill it up" "Is it possible for me to forget you?" "Am I at fault for having met you?" "For responding to your love with denial" "For ending up as an unanswered question" "I'm leaving you behind in pain" "I'm the deepest wound within you" "Time has left me with a bitter taste" "Destination is in reach Yet, I stand off the path" "Though distance has been in favour" "Are we bidding adieu to each other?" "Are we letting go of so called love?" "I shall put on a smiling face" "I shall hide the tears you had rolling" "I shall appear like a sweet fantasy" "I shall cloak the pain my dreams behold" "I shall take you for a forgotten memory" "I shall present you as a stranger" "Life turns into an act Light lets shade take over" "I've had enough of this game" "You're unforgettable" "Your love is the testament" "It's not easy to part ways" "Is our union a boon or a curse?" "Is it fair in love to separate?" On the day we met, you asked me a question. Who is wrong? The thief or the people who buy stolen stuff? If you stop stealing stuff... Many would stop making a mistake. Hard earned money ends up in your pocket no matter how reckless you are. But the money earned through wrong means doesn't last. I didn't have the liberty to tell you at our first meet. If I still don't tell you... Our friendship has no meaning. Take care. What happened? Why is everyone so serious? Vicky came here. Ya, sure We'll catch up in the evening. Hi Krishna We were just talking about you. Please come. Have a seat. - One second. Actually I have something to tell you. My name is Vikram Krishna. Okay. Vicky. He told it. Vicky! - Please wait, uncle. It's entirely my fault. When Nikki said we'd love each other for 2 months... I was only thinking about those 60 days. But Nikki imagined a life with me beyond those 60 days. I couldn't give her the love she wanted. So, she left. I'm back to win her love again this time. But I lost her trust. I'm leaving. So, he left right? What now? Nikki, all of us can see his love for you. Why can't you feel it? Because there's no honesty in his love. It's filled with lies. If he has a problem with me, he should come talk to me. Not his friends... When I asked if I was bothering him, he should tell me the truth. Not a damn lie... You can question him in front of two families when you overheard him rant about you. You can speak ill of him to an entire colony in London. But he can't share his emotions with his friend, right? Lies go hand in hand with a relationship. Forget everyone else Take your dad for example. In 30 years of our marriage, he never drank my coffee. How long does it take to tell me he doesn't like it? But he must have thought I'll be hurt if he said so. Doesn't that mean he loves me? I see... Love in his lies. But you... You see lies in his love. Nikki told me Be it a broken doll or a heart... No matter how and you try, you can't bring it back to life. It'll never be the same as earlier. I tried, uncle. I tried to mold it to look more beautiful than before. But Nikki's heart can't go beyond the cracks and look at its beauty. I hope she notices that beauty someday. Let me talk to her once. No, auntie. I deserve this. Auntie, you know it I didn't know what love or pain was. Once Nikki left me, I realised what love is. And when she said she doesn't want me anymore... I realised how pain feels. A pain so shattering that... I would've felt it if I witnessed my mom's death. I would... I'm crying! It's obvious. It's the karma of hurting Nikki so badly. You must have longed to do this. To hit Vicky when you face him... Go ahead! At least your anger will be released. Did he cry, dad? Did he cry for me? You know he never cried in his life. Don't you feel sorry? All of you were right here. You still couldn't stop him from leaving. Damn! You should have tied him up until I came. You're all such a waste. I'll only go get him. Nikki - Hey Nikki You're so flirtatious all the time. It's her wedding. She just gave her card. Sorry. It's okay. Why don't you answer my calls? Phone was on mute. You changed back to your old clothes, huh? I'm traveling. I need to be comfortable. Why are you leaving suddenly? - You only asked me to go. So? Will you just follow my orders like a school kid? Okay. I don't care of you go. I'm not here to stop you. - Why'd you come then? I came to return the doll. Come on, give it! Okay. Stop! Give me that. You really don't understand why I came here? Or are you doing this on purpose? I came. I cried. I slapped her. Yelled at you for nothing. And I'm talking crap. How else do I have to tell you? - Nikki I understood everything the minute you arrived. But you hurt my ego in the morning. So I was just playing with you. Didn't I tell you? I'll kiss you when I feel like it. Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary! You know this is my first kiss. But to me... I'll kill you if you say the number. I love you Nikki! I love you more. You'll take good care of me, right? Hmm. You'll stop lying, right? Hmm. You'll stop flirting with girls, right? Tell me! Hmm. Promise? Promise. Wait. Wait. Ya, where are you? He must have told someone a really big lie. I'm so sorry, Officer. I was in a hurry and I didn't realise how I parked it. Sorry, ma'am You'd have to talk to my superior about that. Don't look at her - Vicky Will you go talk to her? Me?! - Yeah. Sure? - Yeah. Okay, I'll go talk. You sit in the car. Okay. Excuse me, Miss! English is a funny language, I say. The one we're not supposed to miss is called as Miss.
