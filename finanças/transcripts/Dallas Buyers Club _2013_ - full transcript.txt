In your initial blood work. So, we ran some additional tests. It's your blood tests. What kinda blood tests? cause.. I don't use drugs. - We didn't test your blood for drugs. Oh good, cause, that ain't none of y'all business anyway. That's all right. Uhmm.. You've tested positive for HIV -- Which is the virus that causes AIDS. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm like that fuckin' Rock cock-suckin' Hudson bullshit?! Mr. Woodroof. Have you ever used intravenous drugs? Have you ever engaged in homosexual conduct? Homo? Did you say, Homo? - Yeah. That's what you said..isn't it? Are you fucking kidding me? I ain't no faggot, motherfucker. I don't even know, no fucking faggots. Look at me. What do you see..huh? A goddamn rodeo is what you see! Mr. Woodroof? - Alright, just fuckin' watch it. Mr. Woodroof, can you just.. No, I can't do shit! You speak fucking English motherfucker! Calling me a motherfucking faggot. I'll rip your fuckin' ass boy! Your T-cell count is down to nine, A healthy person has between five hundred and fifteen hundred. Frankly, we're surprised you're even alive. Surprise this: you've made a fuckin' mistake! You must've mixed my blood with some daisy puller or sumptin. Cos, that shit ain't me. - We ran the blood test several times. Here's some information about HIV and AIDS you may find informative. These are your test results. Mr. Woodroof, If you could listen to me for a moment. I know this can be a very scary thing. And, you're probably feeling alone right now. But, what we'd like to do is to impress upon you the gravity of your situation. Based on your health. Based on your condition, based on all the evidence we have; We estimate that you have about thirty days left. To put your affairs in order. Thirty days? I'm sorry. Fuck this! What is this shit?! Fucking thirty days. Motherfukers! Let me give y'all news flash, there ain't nothin' out there that can kill fuckin' Ron Woodroof in thirty days. Day 1. Damn, doctors cut your balls off?

They tell you got brain cancer. Shit, I heard you get that.. ..just by touchin' someone. Or.. ..that queers get it. - Fucking faggots. That's it. Which is exactly why it's a mistake.

Miss Alaska..Miss Louisiana. Bye, care boy. RICK FERRIS: Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally developed as a treatment for cancer. With the onset of HIV, however, we at Avinex Industires began a trial in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals. Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts, restored T-cell immunity.. - Isn't it also true that it had some... Troubleing side effects in animal tests, a significant decrease in the red and white blood cells in the animals? Yes, but its effect on the virus is better than anything else that's been tested. In '64, when AZT was developed for cancer treatment, it was shelved; due to lack of anti-cancer efficacy and toxicity. We believe those problems were dosage based. So, you're conducting another animal study? Actually, the FDA has given us permission to go straight to human trials.. ...which is what brings me here today. We're conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial.. ..throughout the United States. Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites. How long do you see the study going on? We're hoping to fast track it.. ... within a year? During which time the hospital and its administering physicians will be very well compensated for their efforts. Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only get worse before it gets better. And, I know I speak for everyone at Aven Exem when I say, This is a unique opportunity. A chance to be on the forefront in finding a cure. Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy to see these guys talking about; curing the sick while they're flashing gold Rolexes? What do they know about sick patients? - They're a big pharma reps, not doctors. And like it or not, this is a business. How the hell did they get permission to go straight to human trials? People are desperate. You know, people are dying. There is nothing else out there. Fuck! Day 7. I need to see Dr. Sevard. Dr. Sevard's not here today. I can't wait till tomorrow. If you'll tell me what the problem is, maybe I can help you. You wanna know the list of my problems? My lungs bleeding, my skin crawling, there's a fucking jackhammer in my head and that's the least of my fuckin' problems lady. Mr. Woodroof? - No, no..no...no. I don't want no nurse. I want a doctor. I want a goddamn doctor! NOW! Well..How can I help you? - Are you fuckin' deaf, lady? No, I'm a fucking doctor! If you want to discuss your list of problems, you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes. Okay? I like your style, Doc. Mr. Woodroof. Can you get me AZT? I know the Avinex Industries, just released it for testing, right? I wanna buy some, now. That isn't how it works. For about a year, a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo, It's totally left up to chance, not even the doctors are allowed to know. Who you give.. .. dyin' people sugar pills? It's the only way to know if a drug works. Can you get some for me? I got cash. I can go a month.. ..a week. However you wanna do. - I hear you. Unfortunately, no. But, when it's proven to work and.. ...if you fit the profile, then yes. So, you're tellin' me I'm as good as a horse, being held for dog food..huh? Okay. How about this stuffs, overseas..huh? In Germany, they got this.. Dextran Sulfate. Alright, they got this DDC in France, It's suppose to keep the healthy cells you got. From getting, the HIV. They got AL 721 over in Israel... How can i get some of this? None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA. Screw the FDA, I'm gonna be DOA. What..I gotta.. ... sue this hospital to get my medicine? - Mr. Woodroof, I assure you, that would be a waste of precious time. There is a support group that meets daily, at Draddy Auditorium. I suggest, you try it out. Maybe, talk about your feelings and your concerns... I'm dying. What're you tellin' me to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots? Good day. Hey! Neddie Jay, get me a shot of Cactus and a buck back. Goddamn. It's hard to say, how much I missed your all ugly mugs. What do you say Clinto, where you hangin' ..your pants lately today? Get me another beer, will you, sweetheart? What the fuck, did you say? I said grab me a cold one, Sugarcake. You askin' me to kick yer ass? Nah, wouldn't wanna get none of that faggot blood on me. Hey, come on. - Fucker! No..no, I'm alright. That motherfucker is the fucking problem. What the fuck is your problem, man? Hey Ron, I don't want no trouble, alright? Fuck you all! Fuck, all of y'all! Fuckin' goddamn it. He spit on my face. Can I get a fuckin' soap? - Get me a towel...please. c'mon. Fucking Christ! As I stand here tonight, clinical trials are underway.. with an eye toward fast-tracking AZT and making it available for the public as soon as possible. In short, I'm happy to say that help may finally be on the way. How long before the drug is approved? The FDA standard procedure to approve a new drug is eight to twelve years. Hey, It's your first time right? - Back the fuck off Tinkerbell. I'll knock your teeth so far into your goddamn throat you're gonna put toothbrush into your asshole But, we need it now! It may help, Hell..we'll take the chance! What about dextran sulfate?! We're working closely with the FDA to make sure every effort is made to fast track.. It's both our job and the FDA's to make sure the drug is safe - Forget it, we can get it in Mexico. I just need to slow it down a little. Get me down and catch my breath, will you? I ain't ready to crawl into a corner. Alright? I just ain't fucking ready. Man, if you're up there you better be listening, a'right. And if I got one chance, I don't mind. Fucking chance, show we a sign. Show me the sign. If you're not gonna look or buy a dance, you could at least tip me. Here's twenty. I'll take a dance, it ain't fer me. You just keep it on shaking, I'll see you. Day 8. Day 9. A beautiful day, in Dallas..Texas. Right here, Motherfuckers! There ain't no more, they started lockin' it up. I got more cash. Here. What the fuck is this? - In Mexico. A doctor, he has some. What the hell is this bullshit? You don't think I know.. what you're fuckin' doing man.. huh? Ron? Hi. Beautiful. You're in the hospital. You almost died. I bet that didn't surprise anyone. Right? Was that a smile? You've had a blood transfusion. Mr. Woodroof.. I'm doctor Sevard. Yeah. I remember you. I need you to tell me where you obtained AZT from. How it got in your blood. Oh, I don't know what you're talkin' about. Dealing in pharmaceutical drugs is illegal. Yeah. Get some rest. Where are you goin'? We were just gettin' somewhere. Honey, you don't have the slightest chance. I'm Rayon. Congratulations, fuck off and go back to your bed. - Relax, I don't bite. I guess you're handsome in a Texas hick, white trash, dumb, kinda way. Get the fuck outta here, whatever you are. Before I kick you in the fuckin' face. You wanna play cards? You got cash? How does that strike your fancy? Do you mind, If i snuggle? Stay at the end of the bed. Ten dollar minimum? Be my guest. Alright, Miss Man. What you got? Full house. Jacks over threes. I'd have figured you for queens. Motherfucker! Sorry darlin'. Goddamned! Aww!! You alright? Wait relax. Where's it? - Get off me. I got you. I got you, don't worry. Just relax..relax. Breath. Breath. - Right there. Get it..get it. I got it. I got it. That's it. Okay, let me get you some water. Drink this, darling. You gotta stay hydrated or your muscles will cramp. Ohhh! - That better? That's better. That's good. You got nice feet. Jesus Christ, I'm straight, Alright!? Why the fuck you in here anyway? The AZT trial. My friend is paying me to split my dose with him. That way we'll both get some. How much is he paying you? Five grand. I coulda charged him twenty. Hey? If I want any. Will you sell me some? I'm sorry, sweetie. I can't split my dose and hers. Besides, I made a deal. Anyone who plays cards like you ain't got five grand anyhow. Right here. My lord, sometimes we can't get a moment's rest around here. Mr. Woodroof! Where are you going? I signed myself out. - You're too sick to leave here. The worst-case scenario being what? We can keep you comfortable. What? Hook me up to the morphine drip. Let me fade on out? Nah, sorry lady, but I prefer to die with my boots on. I still live here, you hear me?! I fuckin' live here!! Fuck you! Day 29. Day 30. I'm lookin' for Dr. Vass. - Speak up. I'm lookin' for Vass, for some AZT. Yeah? You won't find that shit here. Looking to poison yourself? Jesus fuckin' Christ! Maria? Check him in. Cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine, AZT? That's what I call a recipe for disaster. This place is a shit-hole, Doc. Who said I was a Doctor? They revoked my license to practice three years ago, that's why I'm down in this shit-hole. Why? What'd you do? Ahh.. Now, What these drugs you're doing, they're breaking down your immune system, making you susceptible to infections. So, you're saying cocaine gave me pneumonia? No, I'm saying, Cocaine made you more susceptible. As did AZT. I thought AZT's supposed to help me. The only people AZT helps are the people who sell it. It kills every cell it comes in contact with. Now, I'm prescribing, a regimen of vitamins.. ..as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system. You'll also be taking Aloe and essential fatty acids. Sounds fun? You missed your last trial appointment, Ray. Where were you? o you like this blouse? Cause I think the neckline's a little plungeing. Rayon, the whole point of this study is to determine if AZT is helping people. Come on, Evie, you know there ain't no helpin' me. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying. Why are you so good to me? Bless your little heart. Just promise me, you'll show up for the rest of the trial. I promise you, that I will try my very best. I want you, to mean it. Okay. Is that Marcus from home-ec? I swear to God. He's grown up, my Lord! A little too plungey, by the way. I think, yes. I appreciate ya honesty. Damn it. three months later Well? Better. Your T-Cell count's improving. I still got HIV? You'll always test positive for HIV, and now, you have AIDS, could be all the toxic shit you've been pumping into your body, You shot your immune system. Now you have chronic pneumonia, among other things. It can cause memory loss, mood swings, aching joints... -If it sucks, I got it. I can't get my cock up... all that shit.. Whatever is shit i go it. Don't I? Yeah, well.. Let's not start a pity party too soon. This is DDC, it acts as an anti viral similar to AZT but less toxic. And this is.. Peptide T, it's a protein -- totally non-toxic. Early studies have shown it these can help with all of that. This is what I had you, since you got here. And you can't buy them back in the U.S.A? No, not approved. Look at this place. Chinks, homos and herbs, hot nurses.. you got a regular new world order going on here, Vass. You could be makin' a fortune off of this. If you get caught, don't say you got AIDS. Or, they'll never let you back in. A blessed day to you, Sir. Have ablessed day. Anything to declare? - No, nothing. Have a good day. - Thank you. And, a blessed day to you, Sir. - Father, passport, please? Anything to declare. - No sir. Nada. You're a priest? Yes, I am. I'm Richard Barkley, from the Food and Drug Administration office. How can I help you, Mr.Barkley? Well... You have over 2,000 pills here. You are only allowed to bring in a ninety day supply. As I was telling the gentlemen earlier, I am a sick man. I have cancer. I take 22 pills a day. and these are my vials of Vitamins. This is non-toxic protein serum. This is my ninety day supply. Vitamins? You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale.. ... is a very serious offense? - Of course, it is. As I said, they're not for sale. Nor are they illegal, Merely "unapproved." If we get the slightest indication, that you're selling these drugs for profit, you could be thrown in jail for a very long time... Father. Hand to God. I promise to take every one of them pills myself. My life depends on it. Son. Cowboy, are you coming in? Are you fucking kidding me?! This man also had a transfusion? The AZT. We can tell who's on it by the symptoms. Most of them need new blood. He's actually getting worse. So, why are they stopping the trial? What do you mean? - Avinex Industries. You didn't see the memo? They claim most people are feeling better and fewer people are dying. Transfusions always makes patients feel better. Give the placebo patients new blood and they'll feel better too. I have questions about the drug's safety, David. It's dropping white blood cells in a lot of my patients. It's their call, Eve. So, we can get the drug to the people who actually need it. After eight months? Well, test results are overwhelmingly positive. AZT works. We don't know, what the long term effects are. It's irresponsible. These people die, Eve. There are no long-term effects. Can I read a copy of the study? It's still being written. Hey, hey..hey...hey! Jesus Fuckin' Christ! You fucking idiot! I've been looking for you, Lonestar. - You know, I could've killed you! I feel better! I wanted to thank you. Well, Good for you. Now get the fuck out! I need more of that cocktail shit you got! Listen Tinkerbell, unless you got more cash or new clients.. I'm busy. Now, get the fuck out of my car. - Let's just do this quickly so I can get the fuck out! You got enough for 20 of us? Yep. You know what? You don't deserve our money, you homophobic asshole! Toodle-oo. Am I fuckin' dreamin'? I got your 20 in trunk. Find me 20 more and I'll cut you in. Five percent. Adios, cowboy. What the fuck is your problem? I can handle your insults, but... five percent? Alright, Ten. Twenty five, take it or leave it. I don't have all day. Deal? Deal. Here y'all. Two T's for one of that. How much? - 25. Rayon, where the fuck are you goin'? Com on in, It's a fucking bore out here! Goddamn it. A tree with most honey, attracts the most bees. Lot's of customers here, darlin'. A little smile, will go a long way. Thank you. Fuck off. Ronnie, where're you going? You gotta be kidding me?! This place is perfect. We gotta lay low. Not get busted. Besides, I got a plan. Well, it's a very attractive place. Right up you alley. This place is disgusting. We have got to disinfect. Do not use the word ?we?. Now you wanna put your apron on Then, start cleaning shit up. I wouldn't know, where to start. Howdy Counselor, Hi, I'm Rayon. He's my partner. Business partner. Your office's next door. Have fun, boys. El produco de Mexico.

I am so sorry, but... we are no longer allowed to export.. ... interferon to the United States. What do you mean, Doc? We discussed this, two weeks ago. On the telephone. I was... not aware of the regulation. Two weeks ago. I am sorry. I know you've come a long way. Fourteen hours.. on a plane.. but hey, who gives a shit, right? Listen.. if it's a about money, I can make it worth your while. I've got case full of cash, right here. Please understand. Japanese doctors, will be the only ones who can make the purchase. Alpha interferon....Two thousand vials. That is correct. That's right. Delivered directly to my office. Thank you. Slow drip. - Interferon? Very strong. Goddamn, I like your style..Hiroshi. Prepare the sedation. 10 milligrams. Propofol. - Your passport please. Where're you coming from? - Oh, excuse me. Japan. Medical research. Good to be back, in U.S.A. Thank you, Sir. We don't know what the drugs are. He's got HIV. - Woodroof? AIDS.. I got AIDS. Come on in, Join the party! Ahh, Mr. Woodroof. Doctor Sevard. I bet you're surprised, to see me. You nearly killed yourself. So, we need to know where you acquired the drugs. And I need to know, what exactly you're pumpin' into bloodstream here Doc. Alright. This is a combination of AZT... and uh..we also got a full spectrum of... Don't... I'm suing you for attempted murder! Where's my stuff? Barkley.. Your stuff gave you a heart attack. - Go to hell. I say what goes in my body, not you. That decision, like it or not, is left up to the people in this hospital. You think I'm one of your goddamn guinea pigs, Sevard..huh? Well do I look like a rodent to you? - Mr. Woodroof, You think you're clever? You shoot your body full of unknown drugs. And, you're smuggling a two year supply. Well, hear this. I will bust you, I will take you're drugs and I will burn them. You are done! -You're a fool... if you think you're helping yourself. - That's right. I fooled you, didn't I? You said, I'd be dead in thirty days. Well HOWDYFUCKINDOODY, cuz it's a year later.. and lookie who's still here? I'm done with you. Roanie! - You got anything to say to me.. you say it to my real doctor. Dr. Eve Sak. And you.. bring the fuckin' army. Mr. Woodroof, please get back to the bed. - Ain't dealing with you. What the hell is going on in here? Goddamn, that was good though right? You're his physician and you can't tell me what medications he's on? He came in once for advice. I have no idea what he does outside of this hospital. Well, the FDA confiscated over two thousand vials of alpha interferon. Which he was about to sell to AIDS patients. To our patients! - Actually, I've been reading about Buyers Clubs. They've been having some success eliminating symptoms with some of these new drugs.. - Yeah and without controlled trials, We're not gonna find a cure because we'll have no legitimate data. Tell your patients to stay away from him. Yes, sir. No. Yeah..uh huh. Hold on..I said, hold on! This guy says the Florida Buyers Club is cheaper. Well then, tell him to move to the fuckin' sunshine state! David:That's what I'm telling you. I can't get it back. What do you mean you can't get it back?! It was authorized by a doctor! The FDA said it was a Japanese doctor with no legal standing. What can I say, they make it up as they go. Goddamn it! Alright, check Amsterdam, China and Israel. cause that's where I'm fuckin' goin'! I like your style, Doc. Good doing business with you. I don't trust the white coat who's trying to sell me the drugs. I Fed-Ex it to Seattle to my lab there and they test if for me.

Alright, looks real promising. I need to ask you a favour. I need you to write me prescriptions, so, I can come back across the border. I might not need it but if I do, Then, I'll have them. You know this rule that the FDA just passed, it's total bullshit. It's all lip service. - I know, you're right. And I can't either. I'm sorry. We can't write scripts for random people and random drugs. Plus, what if something goes wrong with these drugs? We could get sued, lose our license. - I know..I know. I hear you. Well, had to give it a shot. Speaking of... I'll be taking one, this afternoon; Thinking about you. Senor! You keep that, nurse Ratched! Okay, i'm taking you to the hospital. C'mon. - No..no...no! Rayon, trust me. - No! I don't wanna die! You're not gonna die. You're not gonna die. Now, just..trust me, c'mon! Secretions that the caterpillar uses to protect itself.. ...during the incubation period... ...act as a non-toxic anti-viral for humans. The answer to a question. Check this out. It's The Lancet medical review. And, they published a study conducted in France. It proves, AZT alone is too toxic for most to tolerate, and had no lasting effect on HIV blood levels. Of course, Avinex Industries and the NIH they didn't include, the study in their press release. Of course, they didn't. Now, these are early trial results for Fluconazole. The anti-fungal? - Yeah. - I read about this. You want to take some home? - As much I can carry. You can come in, if you want. - Oh, no. I took him off of it as you instructed. He's just on morphine now. I'll be in my office. Thanks for calling. Walker, Dorsett, Blount, Newsome, Jeffcoat... these are patients? Yes, sir. They're also the names of players on the Dallas Cowboys. No shit? Well, that's a hell of a coincidence, isn't it? Isn't this a little ridiculous? - You said it. Can you prove these are patients? Can you prove they're not? How're you doing, Denise? - All right. Those are the emergencies. Where is the Idiot? I thought, you knew. At the hospital. I need security on the fourth floor, right away. Mr. Woodroof. You need to wait outside. - There you are, you son of a bitch. Mr. Woodroof. Woodroof. You need to wait outside. You are a murderer! You call yourself a doctor, huh? You are a fucking murderer! Don't let him kill you. Take him out of this hopital! Oh, Jesus. Excuse me. I got two from Austin. All on AZT. Their insurance is paying for the treatment..But, ..they don't know if they can afford to switch. Hook 'em up. But...We're pretty cash poor. Sell the car. Anemia, Cancer, Bone Marrow depletion. Seizures, Fever, Hearing loss, Impotence, Neuropathy,.. Sound like AIDS to you? Nah, that there comes.. ...in a box of AZT, a list of the side effects. No wonder Rayon is dead. Rayon was a drug addict! He didn't die from one day of AZT, He died from the disease as a whole! You stole my prescription pad, Ron! So, don't accuse me of acting irresponsibly! Rayon came to the hospital, on his own.. - ..and got dragged out in goddamn garbage bag! He was my friend too! Read that. I want all my HIV patients on the asymptomatic study to have their AZT dosage lowered to minimum, 600mg. I got over 3 thousand people who need to get their hands on Peptide T. Including me. - Yeah, I understand. They shut your lab down. What can I say? - If I don't get it by the end of the week.. I wanna file a lawsuit. - Come on, Ron. You lost the restraining order, remember? This is Texas. The court system is your final resort. Well, then find a place where it fuckin' ain't. Alright, go to... San Francisco, get me a goddamn sissy judge, just figure it out! Ten thousand of 'em. Perfect. I'd like to turn it over to my collegue in the CDC who'll talk about prevention. Mr. Woodroof.. Would you kindly, tell us what you are doing? Just giving people information, Richard. At this trial I'm in. And, make sure they know what's going on. And, what is going on? Why did you cut off, Peptide T, Richard? Non-toxic drug, that I got proof work. Not only the National Institute of Mental Health, your own people... say, it's completely safe. Mr. Woodroof.. I'm afraid that you're nothing more than a common drug dealer. So, if you'll excuse us.. - Oh, I'm the drug dealer? No, you're the fuckin' drug dealer. Goddamn, people are dying. And, y'all up there are afraid, that we're gonna find an alternative without you. See, the pharma companies pay the FDA, to push their product. Fuck no, they don't wanna see my research. I don't have enough cash in my pocket, to make it worth their while. It's enough! - That's it right there. I tell you what.. I'm gonna be a pain in your ass, till I'm six feet under. - Let's go outside, now. Maybe, one day. You'll get off your ass and do your fuckin' job! I need you to leave, let's go. Here, pass this around. Here, Don't listen to those cocksuckers. We think it is in everyone's best interest that you resign. I won't. You'll have to fire me. Eve. Eve? Y'all go fuck yourselves! One left. That took some balls! Hey..a nice, warm hug... That's what you need. That and a.. ..day of watchin' some bull ridin', doctor Woodroof's orders. You ever miss a regular life? Regular life? What's that? It doesn't exist. Yeah, I guess. I just want... What? ... an ice-cold beer, bull ride again. Go, take my woman dancing. I want kids... I got one..one life right? -- mine. But I want someone else's sometimes. Sometimes, I feel I'm fighting for a life I just ain't got the time to live. I want it all to mean somethin'. It does. Sir..sir. Step over by your vehicle. Step over by your car. Hey, I got this. - Sir, step out of the road. Hey, I got it. Ron, what the hell is going on? Do you understand me? Come on. Why don't I get you home. Judge: The Constitution, specifically the Ninth Amendment, does not state that you have the right to be mentally healthy.. or physically healthy. It does state that you have a right to chose your own medical care; but that is interpreted as medical care that is approved.. by the Food and Drug Administration. Regarding the FDA, the court is highly disturbed by its bullying tactics.. and direct interference with a drug whose own agency has found to be non-toxic. The FDA was formed to protect people, not prevent them from getting help. The law does not seem to make much common sense, sometimes. If a person has been found to be terminally ill.. they ought to be able to take just about anything they feel will help... but that is not the law. Mr. Woodroof, I'm moved to compassion by your plight, But, what is lacking here is the legal authority to intervene. I'm sorry. This.. ...case is hereby dismissed. MAN ON PHONE: We lost. What? Following the trial, the FDA allowed Ron to obtain Peptide T for his own personal use. Day 2557 Ronald Woodroof died on September 12, 1992, seven years after he was diagnosed with HIV. A lower dose of AZT became widely used in later drug combinations that saved millions of lives. Source subtitle by -: D3xt3r :-
