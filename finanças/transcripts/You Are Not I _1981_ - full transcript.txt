[eerie music] [Ethel]You are not I. No one but me could possibly be. I know that. [foreboding music] And I know where I have been... and what I have done. Ever since yesterday... when I walked out the gate during the accident. [distant chatter] [foreboding music] [distant chatter] [distant chatter continues] [ominous music] [siren blaring] [indistinct chatter] -[firefighter 1] Okay, go, go! -[indistinct chatter] [sirens blaring] [flames roaring] [foreboding music] [Indistinct chatter] [metal clangs] [flames whooshing] [fireman 1] You gotta move right, you gotta move right. [Inaudible dialogue] [birds chirping] [foreboding music] [Ethel]Of course. This is just a man's world. [crows cawing] [Ethel]If something real should happen, they would stop soon. [birds chirping] [ominous music] [Ethel humming] [continues humming] [eerie music] [Ethel humming] [continues humming] [eerie music] [Ehtel humming] [continues humming] [Ethel]I always hated cars. Hated to see them go by down there. [indistinct chatter] [Ethel] Hated to see them disappear way off up the valley toward the next town. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [Ethel]Made me angry to think, all those people, moving from one place to another. Without any right to. Whoever said to them, you may go and drive your car this morning to Clifton? You may drive wherever you want. [ominous music] [Ethel]No one. I know that. I know there is no chief that says things like that to people. But it makes it pleasanter for me... when I imagine such a person does exist. Perhaps it would be... only a tremendous voice. Speaking over public address systems set-up in all the streets. [wind whooshing] [eerie music] [eerie music continues] [rattles] [ominous music] [clanks] [sirens blaring] [blaring stops] [Indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] [eerie music] [distant chatter] [eerie music] What are you doing? Are you crazy? My sister isn't dead! [ominous music] She's dead. She's dead. [foreboding music] She's dead. [Ethel]It seemed to me... that life outside was like life inside. There's always somebody to stop people from doing what they wanted to do. That was just the opposite of what I had felt when I was still inside. Perhaps, what we want to do is wrong... but why should they always be the ones to decide? [foreboding music] [Ethel]For once, I would decide what was right... and do it. [light music] [light music continues] [Ethel]I managed to countthe gas stations along the way. And I found... there's one more of them than I remembered. [light music] [Ethel]All they had asked me was my address. And I gave my sisters address... because its only a half hour's drive. Besides... I stayed with her for quite awhile before I went away. But that was years ago. I think. [gloomy music] [woman 1 moaning] [moaning continues] [Ethel]The woman next to me must have been a foreigner. [woman 1 moans] [Ethel]She was moaning like a baby. [moaning] [Ethel]And there was not a drop of blood on her that I could see, anywhere. [gloomy music] [gloomy music continues] [door closes] -[background chatter] -[dog barking in distance] [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [dog barking in distance] [dog whimpers in distance] Are you sure she's all right? They... they looked at her all over at the hospital. It's just talk. She'll be okay. [dog barking] But... She don't look well yet to me. Ah, she'll be all right. Just don't let her get excited. [Sister] Well, that's what they... that's what they always said! She just does! Lady, she ain't hurt at all. [car door closes] Hurt? [car engine starts] [car engine revving] [Ethel]All I can feel... that something is about to happen. And when I do, I stay perfectly still... and let it go ahead. There's no use wondering about it or trying to stop it. At this time, I had no particular feeling that a special event was about to come out, but I did feel... that I would be more likely to do the right thing if I waited and let my sister act first. [dog barking] [birds chirping] [Ethel]Right away I saw,she had the whole thing rebuilt, only backwards. There's always a living room, and a kitchen, and now it was on the left. The back door was now at the right end of the porch. She had even switchedthe stairs and fireplace around into each others places. The furniture was the same... but each piece had been put into the position exactly opposite to the way it had been before. I decided to say nothing and let her do the explaining if she felt like it. It occurred to me... that it must have cost herevery cent she had in the bank. [laughs] [Ehtel]And still, it looked exactly the same as it had been when she began. [laughs] [Ehtel]I kept my mouth shut. But I could not help walking around with a good deal of curiosity... to see if she had carried out the reversal in every detail. Sit down, Ethel. I've got something to do. [clears throat] I'll be right back. [Ethel]I knew already where she was going. She was afraid of me... and she wanted Mrs. Jelinek to come over. [clears throat] Oh, well, well, well, old time. [chuckles] [indistinct whispering] [sighs] [rattling] [rattling continues] [suspenseful music] [stroller rattling] [suspenseful music] [humming] -[sighs] -[Ethel humming] They were supposed to keep her. I don't know. [Ethel humming] I thought so too, but... That man, that man kept saying she'll be all right. [humming] -She looks just the same. -Sure. [Ethel humming] [sighs deeply] [hums] Well, I'm not going to put up with it any longer. [humming] I need to tell Dr. Dunne just what I think of him. Call the home. I surely will. [humming] I'll go see if Kate's in. You stay here. [Ethel continues humming] [retreating footsteps] [Ethel humming] [Ethel]She meant Mrs. Schultz, who lives on the other side and has a telephone. [humming] [Ehtel]I did not even look up when she went out. I have made a big decision. And that was... to stay right in the house and under no condition,let myself be taken back there. I knew it would be difficult, but I had a plan I knew would work if I used all my willpower. I have great willpower. The first important thing to do... was to go on keeping quiet. Not to speak a word that might break the spell I was starting to work. I knew I would have to concentrate deeply, but that is easy for me. I knew it was going to be a battle between my sister and me. But I was confident that my force of character and superior education, had fitted me for just such a battle, and that I could win it. All I had to do... was to keep insisting inside myself, and things would happen the way I willed. [Ethel]This way, I would have what I wanted. "No one can stop you," I thought. [foreboding music] [both whispering indistinctly] [whispering continues] [Sister] I called Dr. Dunne, and I couldn't say that she was released. [sighs deeply] Well.. He told me to hold on to her by all means, because... she wasn't discharged at all. [Sister] Somehow got out. Take it easy, Miss Ethel. [Ethel]I knew she would give me no trouble. Mrs. Jelinek... and Mrs. Schultz, would not go any further than my sister told them to. And she, herself, was terrified of me. Although, I've never done her any harm. She had always been convinced that someday I would. It may be... that she knew now, what I was about to do to her, but I doubt it, or she would have ran away from the house. [no audible dialogue] When are they coming? As soon as they can get here. I see where they have rescued those flood victims. Uh, remember the radio? Huh. [Ethel]The house was very ugly, but I was already getting ideas for making it look better. I have excellent taste in decoration. I tried not to think about those things... and said, over and over, inside my head... [dog barking] ..."Make it work" [dog barking] [foreboding music] [Ethel]I could have laughed out loud... when I thought of what they were really waiting to see. If they had only known it. [vehicle door opens, closes] [mumbling] Where is she? Well, hello. [Sister] To wonder, you couldn't be more careful. When they get out like that, how do you know what they're gonna do? [attendant 1] You want to come with us? Somebody wants to see you. -[attendant 2] Want to help me? -Aw, geez. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [birds chirping] [screams] [Ethel]I felt that my front teeth were broken. I could taste blood on my lips. I thought I was going to faint. I put my hand to my mouth, and I knew... that this was the turning point. I shut my eyes very hard. When I opened them, everything was different. [suspenseful music] And I knew I had won. For a moment, I could not see very clearly. But even during that moment, I saw myself, sitting on the sofa. [eerie music] As my vision cleared... I saw that the men were holding my sisters arms and she was putting up a terrific struggle. [Ehtel's sister screaming] [music box music playing] No! No! Don't! No. [sobbing] [Ethel]My sister was yelling and screaming in the car. No, no. No! No, stop. [panting] [Ethel]As they left the city limits, she stopped... and began to cry. All the same. She was really counting the service stations along the road, on the way back to the home, and she found there was one more of them than she thought. When they came to the great cross, near the spot where the accident had happened, she looked out... but the car was over the track before she realized she was looking at the wrong side. Driving through the gate, she really broke down. They kept promising her ice cream for dinner but she knew better than to believe them. As she walked throughthe main door, between two men, she stopped on a threshold. Took out one of the stones from her coat pocket and put it into her mouth. She tried to swallow it, but it choked her, and they rushed her down the hall and made her give it up. The strange thing, now that I think about it, was that no one realized she was not I. They put her to bed and by morning, she no longer felt like crying. She was too tired. [rain pattering] [Ethel]It's the middle of the afternoon and raining torrents. She's sitting on her bed. The very one I used to have in the home. Writing all this down on paper. She never would have thought of doing that up until yesterday, but now she thinks she has become me, and so she does everything I used to do. [rain pattering] The house is very quiet. I am still in the living room. Sitting on the sofa. I could walk upstairs and look into her bedroom. If I wanted to, but it was such a long time since I've been up there and I no longer know how the rooms are arranged. So I prefer to stay down here. If I look up... I can see the stair window of colored glass. Over the stairs, purple and orange. An hourglass design. Only the light never comes in very much. Yes, the house next door is so close. Besides... the rain's coming down hard here too. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [foreboding music]
