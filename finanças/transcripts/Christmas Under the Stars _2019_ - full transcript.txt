RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM "Merry Christmas, Clem. Here's to the best tree-selling season yet". Okay, settle in, that was the second bell. Grab a stickie, take it back to your desk. Ten words or less. Too much turkey? Snow at your grandma's house? Brought home your Christmas tree? Whatever it is, write it down, stick it on the upper-right-hand corner of your desk. - Mia? - Sorry I'm late. Okay. Now, did you ever think you could measure the distance from each planet to the sun using register tape? They all go bonkers after Thanksgiving. It's the pumpkin pie. It attacks their attention muscles. There's no such thing as an "attention muscle"! You and your science. Just wait till the hot chocolate and Christmas cookies show up. - We're doomed. - Oh, no. Hey, how's Matt doing? He's... He's still pretty quiet. You know, I guess he's just a little lost. I think we both are. First Christmas without his grandpa, your dad? Of course. And between my teaching and trying to get my dad's medical bills straightened out, I just... They're still coming after you for those? He's been gone six months. I know. You've heard of red tape? This is red quicksand. Hey, Kate! Go. Have your meeting. Be important, Ms. Vice Principal. Everything works out at Christmas. You'll see. Hi. Nick Bellwith. Well, Nick, we've reviewed your condo application, tax records, and personal recommendations. You've been at Eckland, Kuhlman and Reynolds for seven years? That's right, and I'm due for a bump to junior partnership before the end of the year. Your father is Sydney Bellwith, isn't he? - Is he in town? - Not at the moment. He's at the Davos Summit, actually. But, let me tell you, nothing would make him happier than if I could welcome him here when he's back in town. And being accepted into this building would speak volumes to him about how I've arrived. Well, unless you have more questions for us, we're all set. We should have a decision before the end of the week. - Thanks, Nick. - Yeah. - You are a lucky man. - Not luck, Dave, hard work. And I'm taking the big swings. You know, you and Trish should look into buying in the building. Oh, yeah, and empty the kids' college funds? Mr. Bellwith? Mr. Eckland asked to see you as soon as you got back. Junior partnership here I come. I got the champagne chilling on my ice. - Yes! - Boom. You've given us a lot of nights and weekends, Nick. And taken a lot of big risks for our clients. 24/7, 365. That's the kind of work ethic you can expect from me, sir. Most of those risks have paid off... ...until recently. Finnlerco. Right, well, that was a bit of a bad turn on a high-yield investment, but these things are cyclical. I don't have to tell you that. It'll come back. A bad turn you tried to rectify by doubling down with the same stock. The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. It's not like Finnlerco doesn't have the money to cover. They're our most important account, Nick. And like I said, the stock will come back. I mean, what are we talking about here? I need you to turn in your security card and your keys, clean out your office. You're fired, Nick. Fired? Over... over one wrong move? I've brought in some of this firm's biggest clients, and I've made them, and the partners, a lot of money. I can fix this, all right? It's not like other clients have been... Other clients aren't Finnlerco. They asked for a head to roll. I'm afraid it's going to be yours. Did you finish your homework? How about your letter to Santa? Yeah? What'd you wish for? - Matt? - I'm at a hard part. Hey, let me ask you something. I have this honors student who keeps showing up late to class. What do you think I should do? - What would you do? - Punish her? Okay, do you think that will help? - Maybe make her mad. - Yeah. Or embarrassed. Maybe her watch is slow. Or she forgot to set back after daylight savings. Maybe. Yeah, what else? Or maybe she just doesn't like your class. Okay, maybe. Ask her. Maybe she has a good reason. I think you're right. The simplest answers are often the best ones. That's what grandpa used to say. Yeah. This is the call I was waiting for. You okay by yourself for a bit? Okay. Hi. It's Julie Gibbons. Right. Right, but I've been double-billed. No, the original bills were paid by the insurance company. I did speak to them. A hundred times. And so I know this is the first time that you're hearing of it, but the records should show that I... Wait, wait. What do you mean, my father's medical debt has been sold? They can do that? Well, who's it been sold to? It's not my problem. Well... Hello? Hello? Mom? Can we go see Clem this week? We could look for our tree. Sure. Yeah, we could do that. And who discovered the mathematical formula derived from the motion of the planets? Anyone? Look up. Kepler. Right. Hey, Mia? You got a sec? You seem a little distracted lately. Is there something going on? No. Maybe we should plan a time to connect, just the two of us? How about Monday, the ninth? I'll set aside my whole morning meet-up for you. I'm sort of busy. Only two weeks till break. You still have time to get your grade up. - Yeah, okay, I guess. - Okay. There you go. Hey! How tall are you? Yeah, you! - You need something? - Yeah... Lend a man a hand? I can't get that over. There we go. You know, the colored lights are nice, but the white ones are my favorite. Better at night. - Clem Marshwell. Clem for short. - Nick. Bellwith. Nick, can I offer you a tree for your help? No. I'm not the Christmas tree type. There's a type? Well, I haven't had a tree in 25 years. I consider that a personal travesty. Right. Well, good luck with the rest of your season. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey. I could use some help around here. Do you think you could handle it? You know, I just took a walk to clear my head. I'm not... I don't have time to sell Christmas... Don't get ahead of yourself, now. I'm the chief salesman. You would be the muscle. Carrying the trees to cars, tying 'em up, and making a delivery every now and then. Yeah... I don't think I'm the... I pay a dollar over minimum, plus all the chocolate you can drink. 'Course, you have to pay for the marshmallows. I'm only joking. The marshmallows are free. What makes you think I need a job? A man out walking the middle of a weekday, looking' like he's carrying a real burden... Could probably use something to do. Clem! Clem! I can't believe it. Is that my Matt? - Yes, it is! - Yes, it is! Hi, Clem. I was wondering when you two were gonna show up. Have I got something to show you! Come on. Come on. I've got four trees with your name on them. It's up to you to figure out which one is yours. But, first, let me introduce you to my friend over... Guess he had someplace else to be. Well... Who wants some hot chocolate? Me! Really? Hey, dad. There's my boy. I missed you at Thanksgiving. The ski staff at Vail send their regards. Yeah. If I hadn't had to work... You know that's the only excuse I'd buy. You hear about junior partner? They... Haven't landed on anyone yet. 24/7, 365? I can make some calls, if you want. No, no, no, no. I want to earn it on my own. Good boy. I'm in Geneva and then Frankfurt. Then it's you and me in Belize for Christmas. Got a couple of contacts coming in from Sao Paulo I want you to meet. You know, I might need to work through Christmas. Well... I was a young man in this business once, I get it. Hey... How's the Porsche? I'm taking good care of her, I promise. Oh, yeah? Still got 100,000 miles on her. You know, I remember the look on your face when I handed you the keys. Yeah. I thought you'd never give up that car. Oh, me neither. Hey, listen, I've got a panel I've got to get to. You keep up the good work, Nicky, and... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, dad. You wanna talk about it? I'm okay, Clem. Really. I've known you since you were knee-high to a Christmas elf. One of the last things your dad said was... "Look out for my family". I just don't know what Christmas is gonna look like this year. I don't know how to make it special for Matt like he did. Well... I can make up for a little of that. Clem, that is not your responsibility. You have your own things going on. You always were the "I can do it myself" girl. But you can ask for help. At the very least, take a Christmas tree. I don't even know what's going under a tree this year, any tree that I can afford in the budget. Everything works out at Christmas. You're the second person to say that. All you have to do is have a little hope. Hope is a little hard right now. Well, that's why they call it hope. What would your dad be doing right about now? Well... He would be hauling a tree out of here, that's for sure. Grabbing the decorations from the basement. Bothering you six days out of seven until Christmas. He was never bothering me. - Getting in your way... - He was never getting in my way. - Causing trouble. - He was always trouble. What if... I'll be there for you and Matt... And you be there for me? Of course. You should've seen little Matt. And Julie. Well... The rest will come soon. All those people will come soon. Pretty good. Mr. Marshwell? Yeah. Who's that? If your offer to work here still stands... I'd like to take you up on it. Well, welcome aboard. That's a good morning's work! Yeah, it was. So what's next? Now's the fun part. Grab a tree. All right. And here you go. Cut the netting off of that. Careful, now. Good, good. All right. - Lift it up and pound it down. - All right. Now give it a pound, give it a good pound. There you go! That untangles all those branches. - Now put it back on the rack. - Okay. And grab another one. Don't worry about mixing up the species. I'll teach you the names of 'em and how to tell 'em apart later. - It seems simple enough. - Yeah, you say that now. Tonight, you'll be pounding down the aspirin. You know, I never really gave much thought to the Christmas tree business. How many trees do you usually sell a year? Used to be close to 500... I got it. What changed? You see that building over there? Developers came sniffing around a couple years back. Well, this area is prime real estate. I'm actually surprised they haven't convinced the city to sell this lot. Well, they have. This is my last season. 30 years. January 1st, they're gonna tear down this building here. I guess I made it just in time. I guess you did. You okay? Yeah, it's just, I probably should've worn some gloves, maybe a different jacket. Well, I got some inside. Come on. - Great. - Let's take a break. It's a good time to do that, anyway. On extra-cold days, I throw an extra pieces of wood on the oil can outside. Makes it smell all christmassy. Here we go! These gloves are vintage 1980s. And this might be a little large, but I'll bet you'll be glad you have it on when the hawk comes whipping through. "The hawk"? Yeah. Yeah. The icy-cold wind off the lake. You know, I can't imagine what you've seen at this place, over 30 years. You, always run it by yourself? I had a partner until a few years ago. What happened? You know, we ought to get to work, huh? What do you say? - Yeah. - Come on. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. But let's get these... We're back! Hey! That's my favorite people. How you doin' there, buddy? I'm doing good! - Hi. - Hi, Julie. Listen, come and meet my new second-in-command. Nick, this is Julie and Matt Gibbons. Thought I was second-in-command. You're second-in-command of the hot chocolate. I thought I was in charge of the hot chocolate. You've been demoted to marshmallows. Then I quit! Here. You take Clem's 1982 work... gloves. Sorry. Just trying to get a laugh. - It's okay. - I'm Nick. And you are? I know Clem just told me. I was listening... Julie. - Julie? - Yeah, what Clem said. - That's my name. - Nick. Nick, I'm Julie. Mom, this is it. Our tree. Smells like Christmas. That's because this is a grand fir, and maybe my very favorite in the whole lot. But I haven't taught Nick here how to tie them up and send them home with folks. I'll tell you what. These, here... They smell the same. Now, you can take those home with you today, okay? - Okay. - All right? - Thank you, Clem. - Thanks, Clem. No problem. Okay, bug, let's let these guys get back to work. Nice meeting you... Nick. And you're J... Jennie? No, no, no. Jessica. I remember. Julie. And if Matt's gonna take my job, he should probably brush up on his sawing skills. Okay. Well, we will keep that in mind. Just something to consider. Okay, bye. - See ya. - Bye, Clem! See ya later there, Matt. Okay! - What? - "What" what? Matt's kind of a shy kid, huh? Actually, he's a barrel of laughs. His granddad passed away this spring, Julie's dad. He just hasn't come out of his shell yet. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, Henry. He was one of the world's best. You know? He moved in with Matt and Julie after her mother passed away, and it's been an adjustment with him gone. For everyone. You and Henry were friends? Yeah, since the air force, 50 years ago. Julie grew up in this lot with her dad, and Matt did the same. You know, it's... Hard, being reminded of the loss. - Especially around the holidays. - Yeah. Well, work helps. Yeah. We set something on fire? No, those are my helpers. Again, I thought I was your helper. Come on. - Looks like you're all set up. - Well, I had a little help this year. This is Reg. He and his crew are here to help put up my sign. - Nice to meet you. - Annual tradition. And in honor of Clem's 30th year, we brought a guest. Clem Marshwell, Emily Kane. She's a reporter with the Chicago Tower. I hear you're an institution, Mr. Marshwell. I was hoping to ask you a few questions, maybe take your picture? Go on, man. Show her around. Well, I've got the station's tree all wrapped up. I can go rustle it up, and show you our stock and how we do things around here. - That would be great. - After you, ma'am. Thank you. How's he doing? Clem? Seems fine. Is there something I should know? We been doing this more than a decade now. He's slowed down a lot. Especially after his wife, Gracie, died, about four years ago now. It's probably for the best. This place is about to be a high-rise. I love Clem, but it's time he retired. Autumn, 1989. My wife and I took a ride out into the country, and saw this big batch of pine trees lyin' in the ditch. Gracie didn't like the idea of them dying there, and it was November. That first year must've gone well. Yeah. It's been a privilege, you know. Doing this is sort of a... Been your calling? Yeah. And what about now? With the lot being sold, and you hitting a 30-year anniversary... Gracie made me promise not to give it up. - So you'll find another place? - 'Course! I can't let it go. Okay, everybody, say... One, two, three... "Christmas tree!" Christmas tree! Awesome! I got it. Thank you. - Thank you, thank you. - Merry Christmas, Clem. - Thank you. Thank you, Reg. - Thanks, guys. You guys, thank you. Have a good Christmas now! Thank you very much. This will appear in tomorrow's paper. - Thank you, Clem. - Nice to meet you. - Bye, Nick. - Thank you. Well, we'll start off bright and early tomorrow morning. Before you're done, I need you to drop off a tree for me. You think you can handle that? We didn't have any customers. That's all right. I wrote down the address. You can take my truck. 'Cause your car... Your car's not really good for driving trees, huh? That's a '94 Porsche, isn't it? Yeah. Mine's a lot older than that. She sputters and leaks every now and then, but then again, so do I. You okay, bug? I know I'm not as mechanical as you, but maybe I could help? We're not giver-uppers, right? That's what grandpa used to say. Yeah, I know. So what kind of questions would he be asking? Matty. This is the part he was good at. Yeah. And now we have to figure out how to be good at things by ourselves. It's the hardest part, right? Nick? Julie. What are you doing here? I'm... delivering your Christmas tree. Come in! I don't understand. Clem said the tree was paid for and to deliver it here. Honestly, I had no idea it was to your house. Mom? Wait. Is that our tree? Yes, it is. But... but Clem said it wasn't ready. I guess he works extra hard for his favorite customers. So, where would you like it? Is yours tight against the trunk? All right. Nice and straight! Now all we need is some water. I can get it. - He's a great kid. - Thanks. You know, Clem mentioned that, he knew you through your dad. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Christmas was his favorite holiday. Yeah, it was my mom's, too. She... she really did it up. Wait, wait. Engineer. All right, well done. Okay, now. Everybody, stand back. Okay. Clem just taught me how to do this. So if this tree blows, it could take your living room with it. Beautiful! - Go put those away, bug, okay? - Okay. How'd you know he could figure that out? Well, I teach 7th-grade science and I'm his mom. You're nothing like the science teachers I remember. They were older and balder. One of 'em smelled really bad. Might've been a chemistry experiment gone wrong. So, what made you want to teach science? I was always the kid obsessed with how everything worked, plus, I had the world's greatest encourager. Your father. He loved everything about science. Asking the big questions. Wondering. Looking up. Must be really hard without him. Especially around the holidays. Yeah. Hey, listen. I might be going through something right now, but I didn't ask Clem to do this. You know, I can... I can take care of myself. There's no question. I mean, look at you. And your son. Well, I've interrupted your night long enough. Thank you for letting me be a part of this. Night, Julie. Night, Matt. Hey. Can you say thanks to Clem for me? And thank you. My pleasure. - I'll let myself out. - Goodnight. Night. Thank you. There you go. Vivian! Hi, girls! How are you? Merry Christmas. This is Nick. He's new here. - Nice to meet you. - So be gentle with him. It's our favorite Christmas tradition. Opening day, the girls insist on coming. Where's Matt? We thought he'd be here. I'm afraid not, but I will let him know that you're looking for him. Come on in. Howdy. - Lieutenant. You're early. - I ship out Monday. Bad timing for the holiday, but you know how it is. Yeah, I remember. How long's your tour? Only six months, but it's hard on Stacy, so I'm getting the tree up. Good man! Good man. Now, last year, you had a... Six-foot noble fir? Right? Nick, you wanna show him where our best ones are? Sure thing. Follow me. Take care. The baby's first Christmas. I can't wait to see what your tree looks like. So he came over with the tree, this... Nick? - How long did he stay? - Like, an hour. He and Matt set up the tree. Is he cute? Real cute! And you're going back to the lot now? Yes, but just with a thank-you. I don't have room for more stress in my life. Sounds like stress removal. I'm about to relieve some more stress. What's the one thing you've been asking for, over and over? To win the lottery? Oh, my gosh, the S.T.E.M. Money? It came through? The school found some extra end-of-year funds to allocate. Comes with a stipend for a teacher who has an extracurricular project... The stargazing? I can find the field and rent the telescope! ...to be used by the end of the year. That's super-fast. Okay... Well, the Ursid Meteor Shower is on the 21st and that's also Winter Solstice. I was thinking I would invite my 7th-grade honors kids. The... Hold on. The school found the money, or you did? Because, if this is charity... It's not charity if you do work and get paid for it. That's called a job. You've been asking for so long. Finally, we can give it to you. So say thank you, because I am the best admin and friend there is. You are. Thank you. It's so good. Mom! I found just the right thing. It's a "Kringle". It's a thank you for bringing over our awesome tree. A Kringle? I don't think I've ever had a Kringle before. It's a Scandinavian pastry thing. They make a lot in Wisconsin, where my grandpa was from. This is called a Christmas Kringle. - So it's a "Chris Kringle"? - Right? - Is that Henry's Kringle? - Yeah! Have some. I was just thinking about that yesterday. This is delicious! Thanks, guys. You're welcome. I think we better put the rest of this away for later. We got people coming in. All right, let's get back to work. Maybe I could help. Of course! I could teach you how to use a bow saw. If that's okay? And it's only the little branches at the bottom. Can you make sure he comes back with all ten fingers? Scout's honor. - He likes Nick. - He does. Clem... Yeah? If I were to leave Matt here for a few afternoons, to help out, - would that be okay? - Sure! - Everything okay? - It's great. - I have a new project for school. - The stargazing one? How long have I been talking about this? What decade is this? You're the science teacher that kids need. Contagious excitement about the stars she loves. You can leave him here as often as you need, okay? - We'd love to have him. - Thank you. I gotta get back to work, all right? That's it! You did it. As simple as that. I should've brought some gloves, too. My hands are freezing. Yes? We need a... What is it? A wreath! Christmas wreath, you know, for a Christmas party, can you do that? Hey, you got any more of that Kringle? I'm starving! - I'll ask my mom. - Thanks, Matt. Why don't you go get some pinecones? They're free. There you are. - You need something? - No. Do you? A break? Maybe food? Nah. I'm fine. Someone to talk to about it? Or maybe I'm just not right for this job. Probably not. But you're here now... Aren't you? Would you mind if I knocked off early? - If that's what you need. - Great. Yo, what's going on? Dave. Could I take you to breakfast tomorrow? Sorry, man. I'm up to my eyeballs. It's Saturday. I'm still at the office. This Finnlerco is a beast. I mean, they gave me the junior partnership... I meant to tell you. Not like this. I've been overwhelmed. Nick. No! No, no, no. I'm... I'm happy for you. You know, if they gave it to anyone, it should be you. Well, I'm sorry. I... Listen. It's fine. It's fine. Congratulations. Honestly. If you need any help with those accounts, you can call me anytime. Yeah. Hey! Looking sharp there! Hey, Clem. I wanted to apologize for the way I acted yesterday. You've got a life outside of here. If you don't want to share, I don't need to know. Well, that's no excuse for being rude. That's true. Hey, Clem! Hey, Nick. Hey, buddy! Did you bring those "Chris Kringles"? Nah. He's gonna show up after we decorate our tree. What? You haven't decorated your tree yet? Mom promised tonight. Wait. Nick should come. He's the only one that can reach the top without using the ladder. You know, you better be careful, because that's how Nick got drafted into working here in the first place. No, I'd love to come. If it's okay with your mom. Well... Do you know any Christmas Carols? Because when we decorate, we sing. Well, lucky for you, I happen to be an expert Christmas caroler. There is "rusty the snowman". - What? - "31 days of Christmas". That's not what they are. And "Rudolph the runny-nosed reindeer". And, "boy to the world". I always start at the top and work my way down, and if you end up with extra lights... Then you just tuck it around back so no one can see. See that? Your mom knows. Did you learn all of this from Clem? Actually, my mom taught me. She was a Christmas Ace. Does she still do it? She passed away when I was little. Littler than you. What about your dad? Does he still do this stuff? My dad goes to exotic beaches over Christmas and fancy ski resorts for Thanksgiving. Now, who's got the ornaments? Pick your favorite, bug. - Ready to light 'er up? - I know I am! It's perfect. Now the star for the top. You know what? It's late, and it's a school night. Bedtime. - Thanks for coming, Nick. - You got it, Matt. Sleep tight. - I'll just be back in a few. - Yeah. Okay. Sorry. He always wants another chapter. I always wanted to wait up for my dad when he was coming home from one of his extended business trips. Sounds like he was gone a lot. He was a very successful businessman. Always traveling the world. Sometimes, he'd take me with him. How was that? I learned a lot. But I kind of yearned for tradition. Sounds like you had a lot of that. My parents didn't meet until they were much older than most married people in their generation. I mean, my dad said that he'd even given up hope of finding a true love, and then... On Christmas Eve, he met my mom. - At Clem's tree lot, actually. - Was she buying a tree? No, she was, chasing a dog that had gone onto the lot. It wasn't even her dog. It was... it was a stray. My dad found them nestled into this row of Christmas trees, the dog licking her face, just having fallen completely in love. Same way he did. Yeah, and then the next Christmas, they were married. And that dog was one of the groomsmen. They named him "Bethlehem", because he was the star that led them to each other. Hey. Where'd you go? Should we... Do you... Would you have dinner with me? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Yeah, me too. Hi, Nick. It's Jody Ladd from Wardstone partners. We received your resume and we would love to have you come in for an interview. And I found the perfect field for stargazing. I'm just running into a couple of problems with the city permit, and... Mia's mom called the... What? Let's hear more about Nick. Some Vice-Principal you are. So, what are we gonna do about this? Well, I... Kind of asked him to dinner. Seriously? Yes! I don't know what came over me. Julie Gibbons asked a stranger out on a date? There you go. Keep it nice and level. Yeah! You're doing it. Hey. They make a good team, eh? Hey... What do you know about Nick? What do I know... what? Well, you guys have been working together for a while. What's... What's his story? What I know is that if you want to know the guy's story, ask the guy. - That's all you're gonna give me? - That is all you are gonna get. Now how about you? You hanging in there? Sure! You're a lousy liar. It's a tough anniversary, the 30th. And knowing that this is gonna be my last. Well, next year, we'll have you up for Christmas from Creek Bend. Sure. Excuse me. The newlyweds are here. Hey, you two! Congratulations. Your boy's a natural. I was only kidding that he was gunning for my job, but now I'm actually worried. So, is, tonight at 7:30 still okay? What's at 7:30? I'm... Coming over with some pizzas and we're gonna hang some lights outside your house. - That okay with you? - Yeah. Then we can go to the tree lighting. The tree lighting... That's tonight? Yeah, the 14th. Did you forget? Of course, I didn't forget. That... sounds awesome. It is. - Thank you. - Tree lighting, it is. Yeah. You're in a good mood. I love the smell of fresh pine and hot chocolate in the evening. It smells like victory. Also, you got a date, huh? I guess you could call it that. And a job interview. That is, if I can take an hour off Monday morning. Yeah, you can take an hour. I'm happy for you. - Thanks. - Good job? It could be. Yeah, what kind of work? Well, I was... am... an investment banker. Is this your life's work? Is this your life's work? No, no. Air force was my life's work. This lot with Gracie... This is my life's gift. Then how come you don't have a Christmas tree in the airstream? Tree? Where would I put a tree? Right there in the corner in the living room. When was the last time you had one? Clem? I thought you weren't the "Christmas tree type of guy" anyway, huh? Well, I don't know if you heard, but someone sent me a few. - You decorate 'em yet? - No, but they smell real nice. Make you a deal. - What's that? - You get a tree, and we'll decorate 'em all together. I'll think about it. - I'm gonna hold you to that. - Okay. Goodnight. - Who's ready for dessert? - Me! Come and get 'em. Cookies. Hey, Matt... What's this? My grandpa loved planes. We used to build a lot of them together. This is the last one we worked on. Want to help me put this part on? Yeah. Gonna have to show me how, though. Hey. Thank you. For what? - For being okay that this isn't a date. - This isn't a date? He's a 10-year-old boy and you're his mom. I get it. It's got to be about him. I would never want to do anything to interfere with that. A lot of guys don't get that. - How long since your divorce? - I'm not divorced. No, I was... I was never married. About 10 years ago, I signed up to be a foster parent. I wanted to... Give back some of the good fortune I got from my parents. Really? But it turns out I'm terrible at it, because I fell madly in love with the very first one and asked to adopt him. That's... that's amazing. Look. I've dated before, and guys say they're okay with a kid, at first, and then reality sets in and... This is different because Matt already knows you and he likes you, and I don't want him... Can we go to the tree lighting now? Sure thing, bug. Welcome, everyone, and merry Christmas. Every year, this community makes a huge difference in the lives of the foster children and their families. Thank you for bringing your kind hearts to ours. Everyone ready? Yes. Hey... you okay? Yeah. I'm... Just a sucker for a star. You teach astronomy, you cry over stars, and your parents had a dog named Bethlehem. I'm starting to see a theme here. When my dad joined the air force, the moon shot was everything. He wanted to be an astronaut, but he didn't qualify, so instead he fixed planes, but he never lost his love for the stars. He always used to say, no matter where you are or how far away you go, you can always look up... The stars will guide you home. He was your north star. He even handmade the star that goes on top of our tree. Sounds like he was an incredible father. I got my candy canes! Hey, Matt. You guys ready to head out? Yeah. Are you ready? - Yeah. - After you. Thanks. All right, your turn. Tell me about your mom. Well... She always started Christmas weeks early. That was the one thing I could count on. Even when she got sick. And what about after she passed? You know that "home for the holidays" thing? Never happened again. And now you're working at a Christmas tree lot. It doesn't take a psychology degree to figure that one out. So what about when the season ends, what happens then? I'm not exactly sure. I recently got fired from my job. I thought I had it all... The dream car, the high-powered position at a major firm... With a partnership in sight. - A law firm? - Investment banking. - Finance. - Yeah. Why? I've just been hit hard by financial companies lately. My father's medical bills were paid, but one company after another keeps telling me that they weren't, and now one of them, I guess, "bought" my debt, and they telling me if I don't pay it by January 1st, then... - Never mind. Sorry. - No. That sounds awful. I had clients that bought and sold medical debt. Is there anything I can do? Well, have you ever heard of this company called Finnlerco? What? Finnlerco was my biggest client. So you traded medical debt? No, no, no. I structured deals for them. I... Okay, so... So you helped the people who are doing this to Matt and me? Wait, no. No, I invested their money, you know, but I wasn't a part of their business. Julie. Let me help you. No. I don't need help. - I want to be treated fairly. - Please. I don't support what Finnlerco did. Believe me. You know what? Your time at Clem's lot is gonna be up in less than two weeks, and then you're gonna go get some great job back in this world, helping more people like that make more money, and I am still gonna be here fighting people like you. So, this isn't... We can't... Goodnight, Nick. Julie. You know, she's right. I was working with these companies, trying to maximize their value, not realizing how it might be affecting people like her and Matt. You like her, huh? I really like her, but it doesn't matter now. She's not interested in me anymore. Let's take a break. So what did you like about being an investment banker? Mostly, I just followed in my father's footsteps. I wanted him to be proud of me. But I can't say I didn't like the perks. Like owning a Porsche, huh? It's not just a Porsche. My dad came from nothing. He earned every cent he had himself. And when I was 13, he bought that Porsche, a symbol that he'd arrived. I pined after that car. He made me polish it and taught me how to take care of it... And when I got into business school, he said that if I could beat his GPA, he'd give it to me. I beat him by one point. So it's not a status symbol. It's your connection with your dad. It's like these trees, isn't it? Hunks of wood with pine sap until we invest some emotion in them. Then they mean the world. - Clem... - Huh? Why'd you offer me this job? You were tall. You were tall and I... I saw someone that was lost and maybe needed someplace to be for the holidays. So you felt sorry for me? I know what lost feels like and the need to work. So... Maybe we were both in the right place at the right time. Hello, Ms. Gibbons. I'm Rae. Mia's mother. - Hi! - Thank you for stopping by. Okay. Ms. Gibbons... What are you doing here? I invited her. Would you please unload the dryer and start folding the clothes, Mia? Okay. I'm afraid this is my fault. I knew a new baby would be stressful. Well, of course. I have a son of my own. But I didn't take into account it came with a new stepfather, while I'm still working full-time. We got married this year, and now the baby... Mia loves them. But you can barely stay awake or focus on anything, much less help a tween with homework, be there for everybody all at once, and still try and be great at your job. You do have a child. Mia's probably acting out because she hasn't gotten much attention. No, no, she's a terrific kid. She's so smart. It's just that she's getting behind. But I don't want her to lose momentum or turn away from school. Actually... Can I show you something? She made them, I think, because of you. She's such an artist. And you know what, they're spaced right. It's to scale. She's quite the astronomer. You know, I'm trying to get all of my 7th-grade honors students to a night-sky viewing on Winter Solstice. I would love for her to be there. Well, isn't Winter Solstice a week away? Yes, I'm just dealing with the parks department and, the permits and... Oh, no, Ms. Gibbons, I work for the city. You write up those permission slips. I'll see what I can do. Permission slips for the Winter Solstice night-sky viewing. It is last-minute, so please, please, please, have your parents sign these and return them as soon as possible. Hey, my favorite people. Hey, dad. Just landed in Tokyo. Wanted to touch base. Tokyo? Everything's great here. Heard anything more about the partnership? No. Nothing yet. As soon as I hear something, I'll let you know. Yeah. I don't know what kind of strings you pulled, but they're pretty good. We come bearing gifts! - Hey, Clem? - Yeah? Where'd the name "star top" come from? That was Gracie's idea. Yeah? And how'd she come up with it? Well, that photo there was taken the night we eloped, Christmas Eve, 1974. Rebels. I was stationed down in Louisiana. And that night, we took our car, and were flying down these Louisiana farm roads... ...and Gracie heard some music. There was a Christmas barn dance going on. That woman loved her zydeco and loved to dance. We snuck in and danced to every song and sang every Carol until we were wiped out. Then we jumped into Ponchitrain Lake to cool off. Then we wrapped ourselves in our blankets and each other and laid underneath the stars so bright, it was like we were dancing on top of 'em. Why didn't you just sleep in the car? If I have to answer that question, you haven't a romantic bone in your body. "The stars you danced on top of". Star top. Well... Gracie woke, one November morning... ...difficulty breathing. We went to the doctor and he did one test, admitted her to the hospital. She was gone by Christmas. I'm so sorry, Clem. She made me promise to keep it going. Until, this year, I had Henry and his shadow... Matt. Yeah. Now, if they close... When they close... Well, what can I do? You know, handle the physical work I can't any longer. And help me figure out how to let this place go. I'm not ready. Nick, I'm just not ready. Look. You wanna take the truck and make the last couple of deliveries? - I'm beat. - Yeah. Yeah, you bet. I'll bring the keys back when I'm done. Just put 'em underneath the door. I'll be asleep by then. And Nick? If you think you love a woman... Don't waste time. Even 41 years wasn't enough. Yeah. Three, four, five, okay. Lot's thinning out. What do we do when we need more trees? When they're gone, they're gone. Four days till Christmas. It'll move pretty fast, from here on out. Yeah. Good luck with that interview tomorrow. - Thanks. - Okay. Look. Ursa minor is right up there to the right. Some people think of Winter Solstice as a difficult day. It is the shortest day of the year, with the most darkness. But... It's also best for night-sky viewing. And every day after today, we'll have a little more light. So I like to think of it as a moment of hope. You've reached Sydney Bellwith. Please leave a message. Hey, dad, it's me. I wanted to let you know the real reason I can't make it to Belize. It's because I was fired from Eckland, and I've been working at a Christmas tree lot... ...where I've met some amazing people who... I... anyway, I... I have an interview at Wardstone partners on Monday, but I don't know if I'll get the job. I know I let you down. And I'm sorry. Clem? Clem! What happened? You okay? There we go. - I told you, I'm fine. - You got glass in your hand, Clem. There was ice on the steps of the trailer. When I fell, I banged up my leg pretty badly. When I went inside, my knee gave out. I smashed the picture when I fell. Does he need to go to the hospital? I'm not goin' to any hospital. Watch out, in case he starts to run a fever., and that those cuts get infected. You shouldn't be hauling trees around. Wouldn't be a bad idea for someone to stay with him either. All right. I'm fine, Reg. We've known each other, what, 15 years? But never once under professional circumstances. I know what I'm doing and I'm telling you... Let people help you. - Take care, Clem. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Yeah. What do you need for 24 hours away? - What're you talking about? - You're staying at my place. - I have to open up here tomorrow. - You heard the man! - And you have an interview. - I'll... I'll reschedule. Four days till Christmas. You reschedule, it's gonna be next year. And you need that job. Well, then you can wait at my apartment until after, and we can open together. Take it or leave it. All right. Welcome. The colored lights are pretty, but I think I like the white ones best. You take my bedroom. I'll make up the couch. No, I've been sleeping the last three weeks in the camper. - I'll take the couch. - Fine. I'll grab you some sheets. Hey. You don't have to do any of this. I know. But what are friends for? Hey, Clem? Hey. Thanks for coming. I asked Kate to stay with Matt. This is a really kind thing you're doing. I was gonna do it on my own, but I thought... - Well, I just thought that... - It was a good thought. I'm glad you called me. Hi. My name's Nick Bellwith. I have an appointment with someone from... Mr. Bellwith? Ellen Wardstone. You'll be meeting with me instead of the human resources manager. - A pleasure. - Please, come in. Have a seat. Now, usually, there would be a meeting with human resources, and a longer dance, but two of my best people walked on Friday to start their own shop and I need somebody with your experience, who can take over their clients right away. Well, you've seen from my resume that I have seven years of experience with high-profile clients and a background in business development. I have. What isn't on there? That I think I'd be right to head your company's focus on socially-conscious investing. Well, most bankers look at that as ethically, but not financially interesting. Well, that's short-sighted. Investments in socially-responsible strategies are up 89% since 2012. I mean, there's more than 150 funds worth over $135 billion that focus exclusively on those companies. Coming from Eckland, Kuhlman and Reynolds, I'm surprised that you wouldn't just be pushing hardcore strategies to maximize return. - A month ago, I would have. - What's changed? Me. I don't want to just make money anymore. I want to make a difference, too. So... How long have you lived in Chicago? - Born and raised. - Good to hear it. Okay, there you go. Thank you. Enjoy. How's it going? This is a cool Christmas break. - What, me putting you to work? - No. Helping everybody. It's sad Clem won't be here selling trees anymore. Yeah. Julie? Clem! I don't understand. You opened? How many Christmases did I spend here with my dad, that I couldn't take over for one morning? Come on. We have a real surprise. We might've came back last night. Fixed things up a little. If you need help getting settled... I can look after myself. You don't need help? Okay, then. I'm gonna go bale some trees. I should get back to the customers. - Get some rest, okay? - All right. Hi. Are you guys looking for a tree? Yeah? Okay, so these are some beautiful scotch pines that we have... What am I supposed to do? Hot chocolate duty? You can be in charge of the marshmallows. Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to joke. This must be really hard for you. How'd your interview go? I'll tell you about it later. What happened? Nick. Nothing. - They asked me to stay. - Today? Yeah. Well, why didn't you? If you jeopardized that job... That's not just helping an old man, that's a sacrifice... - It's okay. - It's not okay! It's not okay, Nick. I should have retired. You made a promise. Anyone would've done the same th... No! Gracie made me promise to give this place up. She knew I was getting old, she asked me to give it up, if I didn't have her here to help me. And then she was gone. Then I leaned on Henry, and now I'm leaning on you. Because without this lot... It doesn't matter. It's all going belly up January 1st anyway. But if you jeopardize that future of yours to help an old man who's trying to hold on... Clem. Clem. Listen. Listen to me. I was really low. I was mad because I got fired from a job that I thought was the most important thing in my life. But working here, being around you and Matt and Julie, and these customers... It's changed me. Look, if you hadn't been here this year, to show me how to give back, I would've kept on living a life that was all about me. But this season, and this... this Christmas... It's all about helping other people. And that's the best gift anyone's ever given me. How many marshmallows you want in your chocolate? I'll take six. Thank you. Ms. Wardstone? It's Nick Bellwith. I know that this is unorthodox for me to call you directly, but the way you conduct business is exactly in line with the way that I want to do it. And even if you've hired someone else, I wanted you to know about a... a business opportunity. Actually, an investment in people who could use an advocate like you on their side. Could you call me back? Ms. Gibbons? - Hi. - Hi. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. Of course. What can I do for you? Have you ever heard of the star top Christmas tree lot? Why don't you come into my office? - Okay? - Sure. Looks like this is our last run. I guess I have to sell you. Dad? I got your call. So... How'd you end up working at a Christmas tree lot? Why don't I show you? - Hello! - Hi, Ms. Gibbons. We're sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve, but, Mia has something for you. It's the last of the work I had to catch up on. I wanted to give it to you before we got back in January. You have done such a great job getting up to speed. Thank you. Well, it's a huge favor you did for us. No, you're the one doing me the favor. Well, you know, I think I may have worked it out. I'm heading to parks and rec to run the last specs, and, yeah, we'll see. If it makes it easier, Mia can stay here. We're just making cookies. - Hi, Matt. - Hi, Mia. So what have you been working on? Ms. Gibbons, I was wondering if I could give you this. It's a drawing, just to say thank you. Hey, Matt... - My grandpa made this. - It's really pretty. Thanks. I think it's time we put it on the tree. - What do you think? - I think we should. We make a wish when we put it on top. Yeah, do you want to make one with us? Yeah, that sounds fun. Okay, everyone, close your eyes. It's terrific. But, no customers? Clem said there might be some stragglers, but being this close to Christmas, it's about closing up. Look, I know you might think all this is silly, but... Why would you say that? The thing with Eckland, working some minimum-wage job. I know what you must think. That's... Nicky, that's not what I think. - Got a cup of coffee? - Yeah. After your mom passed, everybody said I should just send you away to school, gave me the names of around-the-clock nannies. I didn't know how to care for a young boy, but I knew I couldn't do that. So, I just... Fit you in my life and distracted us with the one thing I knew best... Money. When you showed an interest in it, I taught you everything I knew. How to spend it, how to argue for it, and... Maybe how to substitute it for feelings. If I pushed you too hard, or made you think that it was all I cared about, you should know... I'm not proud of you because of the way you handle money, I'm proud of you because of the person you are, and I should have said that a long time ago. I don't know what to say. Well, start by telling me what I can do around here. You're not so bad at this. I didn't start off in the penthouse suite. Hey... We have customers. Better than customers. - Hey, guys. - Hi! Hey there, buddy. - This is my dad, Sydney. - This is Clem. Hello, Sydney. How are you? - Clem, pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure's mine. - This is Julie. - Julie? Sydney. And her son, Matt. Hey, young man. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you! Hey, Clem. I tried my hand at a little interior decorating while you were out. What do you think? Nick... You know, Matt's grandpa always said everyone should open one present on Christmas Eve. Well, since it's Christmas Eve... You want to play Santa, or should I? Cool! What is it? You always gotta have... The right tool for the job. Thanks. Clem? You already got me a tree. That doesn't count. I stole it from your lot. - A new picture frame. - I can hang it for you. I think I'll just hold it for a while in my hands. Thank you. This is... Here's a customer! That's... that's Ellen Wardstone. - From Wardstone Partners? - Yeah. Hi. I figured you'd call, if... I like to do these type of things in person. As we discussed, I called your friend, Dave Voss, at Eckland. Now, I'm not sure how, but he was able to convince Finnlerco to sell the medical debt to us so that it would be off the books by the end of the year. I might have mentioned to him that Finnlerco likes a tax break. Julie? This is Julie Gibbons. - Hi. - Hi. How do you do? She's my inspiration. You know, this hard-working, strong, big-hearted woman did everything right for her family and got taken advantage of by the system. We are restructuring the entire Finnlerco debt, re-examining cases, with the hopes of forgiving illegitimate debt like yours. What? This is your gift. - I hope it's okay that I... - That you helped me? - Even though I didn't ask? - Well, yeah, that. Thank you. Thank you so much. I would, yes, accept any help to handle this issue. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I don't know what to say. - How about merry Christmas? Merry Christmas! Would you mind if I just borrow him for a minute? Of course. Yes. Ms. Wardstone, you just gave the best gift you could've given this Christmas Eve. Well, I've learned that peace of mind is probably the best gift that you can give. There is nothing so important in the financial world that it can't wait for someone doing the right thing. And I am gonna need someone restructuring medical debt, and debt like it, at my firm. Sounds like your expertise, Nick. - The job is yours if you want it. - I... Yes! Yes. Yes, I absolutely want the job. Thank you so much. You're welcome. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. Bye. Four trees, huh? Making up for lost time? Who knows? Maybe next year, it'll be five trees. Thank you. Nice. Everyone? It looks like I have my one Christmas Eve gift to give. The mother of one of my students works for the city, and she did a little investigating for me with the parks department. It turns out Chicago has an incentive program for real-estate developers. If they donate a certain percentage of the land back to the city, the city lowers their taxes, so it's a win-win for everyone. So, the developers have agreed to leave the land star top lot is on as a pocket park, dedicated once a year as a Christmas tree lot. - Yes! - Yes! That was... That ain't what Gracie wanted. Clem... I didn't know Gracie like you, of course, but I grew up watching the two of you together, and I know that what Gracie wanted was for you to be happy. And the lot brings so much joy. To everyone. But to you especially. Right? - It is everything to me. - Then you deserve to keep it. And I think Gracie would be so proud of what you've kept alive in her honor... Plus, we will be there to help you. She's right. To Gracie. - To Gracie. - To Gracie. "Mrs. Marshwell" to you. I was saving this for something special. And it doesn't get more special than this. - Cheers. - Cheers. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
