That was the stupidest movie. Yeah, who picked this film anyway? My brilliant husband. The reviews sounded interesting. Said it was a little weird but worth seeing. A little weird. Well we need to rewrite that review. Yeah. I guess it didn't let on about that one scene did it? Now how was I supposed to know they were gonna show that? When I put my hand over his eyes he tried to push it away. Yeah, but it wasn't so I could see the scene. It was 'cause you had your hands over my nose and I couldn't breathe. I just gave mine a shot in the ribs. Ah, I hope she didn't know it was gonna backfire on her because I already had my hands covering my eyes. And as soon as she hit me in my ribs, my hand went down and I saw everything. Hey man, we finally hired one. New secretary. Yep, she starts tomorrow. Well, I hope you don't run this one off like you did the last one. Ha, funny there David but I'm looking around and guess what? Nobody's laughing. That's right. Hey, Benny and Gerard saw the film and those guys love it. You're kidding? That's what they told me. Catch you at lunch. Benny, Gerard, I heard you guys saw the film and like it. I thought it was great. Me too. You're joking right. I mean Ruben actually thinks that you liked it. We did. You thought otherwise? Well yes, it was weird. But that's what we liked about it. Yeah it got good at being weird. I always thought you guys in IT were a little off base. But now, I know you are. You fouled me, our ball. - No I didn't. - Yes you did. You hit me so harsh you get four shots. Take it out. That wasn't a foul. Yes it was. Our ball, take it out. All right, let's go. Okay er last meeting we briefly discussed our citywide outreach program. You see the budget on your sheet there, would anyone like to comment on what we should do this year? Well, since we have the same budget as last year, why not do the booth at the Chamber of Commerce Business Expo again. Thousands of people came through there and I think we made a good impression in the community. Yeah, it seemed to go well. Any other ideas? Well we could sponsor a basketball camp. We've got some good players in the college department. We could pay them to run a camp for the week. Plus my next door neighbor is a sport's anchor for Channel 8. I bet he'd do a story on us if we asked. All right, that's a new idea. Look, I think the main thing is we show the community we care. If we do the business expo again or the basketball camp, they're both very positive and we really can't go wrong. You know I still really need to think about it. - All right. - Hey. Hey. How'd the meeting go? - It went okay. - Did you decide on anything? Yes, that we'll decide next week. Well, did you say anything? No. David, I thought you were gonna tell them about your idea? Well, we were talking about a booth at the expo again or a basketball camp, you know, things like that. It's hard to say anything. Then why do you even go to those meetings? 'Cause I'm on the outreach committee. But if you have an idea, and you don't say anything. Yeah, I know, I know. Well you should at least tell it to them. Well I will. Next meeting. And what about, what about tomorrow? The new secretary's on board and now we're smooth sailing. Well, I hope we don't run this one off like you did the last. Still trying to be a funny guy, David? But I'm looking around and guess what? Nobody's laughing. You got it. Besides, I didn't come in to chat. Just to make your day, I've got to tell you about this. Yesterday, this is for both of us. Emeka Odum, a leader in world missions and these president of Nigerian Gospel Ministry, will be speaking this weekend in the evening service, live and in person. Emeka Odum, at your church. I love this guy. Mr. Odum has been instrument on the Native Missionary Movement throughout Africa and will be speaking the urgency to reach out for Jesus in these last days. Got you and Danielle, front row seats reserved. Just save one. She meets with the junior high girls and never misses it. Okay then. We got you on the bleachers. I'm really excited about seeing Mr. Odum. And I've read almost all of his books and you know me, I'm not a big reader. Hmm hmm, you gonna try to meet him? Well, I hadn't thought about it but I'd love to talk to him. You know, God used that man to open up my eyes to the world of evangelism. Well, you should go up afterwards and meet him. Tell him that, encourage him. Yeah, I will. Well, I'll try. You meeting Ruben and Cindy there? No, they said they can't make it. Cindy's father's having his 60th birthday so they gotta go to that. Hey, we gotta flick to watch tonight? My brothers and sisters in Christ. Time is running out. Over 150,000 people die in this world, every day. And most of them die not knowing Christ as their personal Lord and savior. This is so tragic, and it is heartbreaking. As believers in Christ we need to make this our number one concern, to reach people all around us, with the gospel. In parts of Africa, missionaries are tortured and killed for trying to tell their enemies about Jesus. They don't want them to die without knowing the Lord. In America we have a hard time telling our loved ones about him. It does not seem to be a concern here. I am afraid that we have become too comfortable here, in this country. We are too much in the world. And it has become attractive to us. We want entertainment. We don't seem to be too concerned about lost souls and dying people. But Jesus is. That is why he gave. Thank-you brother. Thank-you my brother. Hello Mr. Odum, David Williams. - David. - I was really challenged by what you had to say tonight. I agree with you wholeheartedly and I want to help. Well you are kind. The Lord be praised. I know you must be really busy and I was wondering if you had time to talk. I know you don't know me, but I really want to be involved in evangelism. Could I buy you a cup of coffee of tea or at least sit down with you and talk for a short time? I normally don't attend this church. I live on the other side of the city. Well, I have a meeting with these brothers over here, but it won't take long. Now if you can wait, there's a place in my hotel, we can speak there. I want to see people come to the Lord. I mean really come to know Jesus. I'm on the outreach committee with my church. My wife and I support to native missionaries through your ministry in Africa, but we wanna do more. I always feel like I should quit my job and just move overseas. But we don't need you in Africa, my friend. The Lord needs you right here. There's a very big mission for you here in this country. There are plenty of churches here. Some places there's one on every corner. I've traveled your country on and off about three years now. I've spoken in many churches, all denominations, and I sense one main thing in all of them. Most people here do not know how the devil attacks and deceives them in this country. What do you mean? I finished writing a book. I have some copies here. I'll give you one. If you are interested you can read. - Thank-you. - You're welcome. "The Most Powerful Church in America." Why is it called that? David, my friend, I fear for the church in this country. It is in very great danger. Danger? What kind of danger? Well it's got a lot of information in here on the influence of the movies and media. Yeah, I read half that book last night and I feel like I'm lost. David, you're the most committed Christian I know. Danielle, I'm sorry. I told the Lord last night I was sorry too. I let unGodly entertainment creep into my life and I've been deceived. Hold on now, woo. What are you talking about? Hey, let me see that for a second. Here, read that paragraph, right there. I never thought of it that way. Yeah, I never thought of it at all. Did he talk about this during the sermon? No. Danielle, how many Christians does that describe? You must be the new secretary, David Williams. Hi, I'm Monique, nice to meet you Mr. Williams. Just call me David. Is Ruben in his office? No, he just went to the break room. Thanks. Hey, welcome to the team. Thank-you. David, what's up? - You got a minute. - Sure. Emeka Odum really hit it last night. Sorry I missed it. Tell me about it. "Time is running out." He must have said that about a dozen times. There are about 200 people work in this building and I've been here five years. I've talked to maybe four people about the Lord. Man, that's not even one a year. What's wrong with me, man? I know you can't force it on people but I should be sharing more. There's nothing wrong with you, or me. That's the problem. We're both Christians, have great wives, a good job, best place to live in, good churches, a little money in the bank, we got it made. Well I don't feel like I got it made. I want to do more. You've always been into it, man. I'm the one who needs to wake up. It's just not in our heart like it is Mr. Odum's. I mean, it's not about feeling guilty or convicted it's just not in our heart. He ended the message with Psalm 16:11. "In the presence of God is fullness of joy." Now think about that for a second. Isn't that what everyone wants? "The presence of God is fullness of joy." You'd think we'd spend 24 hours a day with Jesus. Then why don't we? 'Cause we got a good job, great wives, nice home, good church, money in the bank. We got it made. Before we decide what we'll do for our citywide outreach, David asked if he could say a few words. David. Thank-you. I've had an idea for some time now and I wanted to bring it up last meeting but didn't. Anyway, this past weekend, I heard a missionary from Africa speak, and then I started reading a book he wrote. This man thinks the most powerful force on the planet is the entertainment industry. It impacts people like nothing else. A famous film producer in Hollywood said this, "The church, which used to be "all powerful has been taken over by film." - Hmm. - What the producer is saying is that motion picture films are making greater impact in this world than the church. So what's the point David? The point is, if we really want to reach people for Christ... We should make a movie. We should look to the media and entertainment as a way to communicate the message. Well what are you suggesting then? I'm suggesting that we take money from the outreach fund and consider doing something that is media related this year. Like what? Well, I don't know yet. David, you have ideas but you never seem to have a plan. God's the one with the plan. We're just trying to figure out what it is. And I know he wants us to proclaim the gospel. Look, our pastor preaches a good sermon every week, but it gets lost compared to the hours of TV and movies the congregation watches. Well, we can't control what people do for their entertainment. But we have to try to reach them. And entertainment is where they are at. I say we do the business expo again. We reached a lot of people last time. Or the basketball camp. Please, let's pray about this idea with the media. I really think this could be a big thing here. I don't want to prolong this decision, but with this new suggestion on the table, let's just wait until the next meeting and then we'll decide. We'll add David's idea to the list. Danielle, can you read this for a second. Sure. Wait, that's an A? How can you tell who gets an A and who gets a B? David, when you're a school teacher in the first grade, everyone's art projects get an A. Oh well, you learn something new every day. Take a look at what he says about the media test. - The media test? - Yeah, just read it when you can, you'll see. Let me know what you think. I think we should try this. Hey man, the movies starts tomorrow night at 8:15. So if we stay around 7:45, don't be late. Which movie? Explosion. Er, sorry Ruben, can't make that one. What? There's supposed to be more special effects in this movie that there is dialogue. Well then it shouldn't take you too long to tell me about it. David, we're talking about a mega, mega movie here and you don't want to see it. Sorry, gonna pass. Are you sick or something? No. Having trouble with the little lady? No. Then what is it then? We have a streak of seeing the last 37 movies together. The four of us. We're supposed to be breaking Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hit and streak with going to the movies remember. Joe's streak will survive. You're sure. Yeah, I'm sure. It won't be the same without you. Thanks. Okay erm, if you change your mind, you know where we'll be. "The media impacts your life in a great way "than you ever realize. "I'll give you an example. "Have you ever noticed the commercials on television? "When the commercials come on, do you stop what you're doing "and shout, shh, the commercials are on, "I wanna watch them. "Well of course not. "When the commercials come on you relax, "get something to eat, take a break, "but pay very little attention to them. "Yet advertisers are paying big money for those commercials. "So the question you have to ask yourself is this, "why would an advertiser pay a great deal "of money to air a commercial on television "that most people don't really watch? "The answer is simple. "Because they know how much television influences lives "and if the commercials that we supposedly do not watch "influence our life, what do you think happens "with he programs we do watch?" Oh, television is very powerful. Most of it has zero to do with the Lord. You know, what if we had a commercial on TV telling people about Jesus? Yeah, like we could afford that. You're listening to 93.5 The King's Station, your number one source for the best in Christian music. News is coming up next so stay with us. I'm Randy Stone, I'll be here tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day and no matter what you do lift up the name of Jesus. Hey there, what's up? - How's it going? - Going great. How are you doing? Doing good. Looks like you enjoy your job. No, this ain't no job. I love it too much. Now you, you've got a job. I hear ya. Hey, you got a minute. I wanna run something by you. Last night an idea came to mind. What if we were to present the gospel on every radio station in the city at the same time? At the same time? Yeah. Do you have any idea how many radio stations are in the city. Yeah, there're 16 rated stations. So if we had an add on all 16 stations at the same time, we'd reach all the people in the city listening at that moment. Well that's right. But I'm not sure every station plays a break at the same time. Well is there any way to find out? Any idea how much that would cost? Yeah, I've got all the rate cards. I could do the research, have the result on Monday. You know it's not a sin to turn that thing on. Nobody said it was. You know, we used to sit here and watch TV shows and movies every night, but er, now we don't watch anything. You could read a book. Yeah, but I like to watch things. So watch something. Just find a program that's more edifying or redeeming and not corrupt like he talks about in the book. Find a Christian channel. Hmm, but the shows on Christian TV are mostly preaching. I want something that's entertaining. Yeah, almost all the TV shows and movies are Godless. Mr. Odum is trying to make that point. That these programs affect our lives a lot more than we realize. And so it makes him wonder. Wonder what? If we're really Christians at all. All because we watch movies? No. He says, "A Christian should be interested "in the things of the Lord, not the things of the world." The movies of the world are Christless, and yet most Christians don't even recognize it. Mr. Odum asks, "Well, why is that?" He then says, "Well maybe it's because Jesus really isn't in them to realize it." That sounds pretty hard and judgemental David. Yeah, it does. But what if he's right? Then, that's pretty scary. That's very scary. How would you like to live your whole life thinking that you were saved and then when he died you really weren't. 37 movies in a row and your broke the streak. No, no no, I didn't break the streak. For the record David broke the streak. That bum. We need to put him on a popcorn restriction for that. Well he's gotta go see Explosion that's for sure. Yes, he does. 14 stations run a 60 second add at 11:59, just before noon. That's your best saturation point if you want all of your spots to hit at the same time. Okay, 14 stations run the add, that means two don't. They other two run breaks at 11:54. One of them is ours so we could easily get that switched. Which leaves one station. Which leaves one problem. What do you mean? 104.1, they call themselves The One. What about them? Well first they're the largest station in the city by far, not even close. Second, they're not too Christian friendly if you know what I mean. So what you're saying is that we could probably get an ad in all these other stations except for the biggest one. That's right. Speaking of one, I gotta be on the air in one minute. Okay, thanks Randy for all your help. I just need to get that one station then. Charlie will never do it. Who's Charlie? The station manager. We'll see ya. I'm sorry, we can't do it for you at that time. Like I said, we don't have a break scheduled at 11:59. But it has to run at that specific time. Can't you make an exception? I just asked Charlie, the answer was "no." Well, can I speak with Charlie for a moment then? Charlie's very busy sir, I'm sorry. Is there something else I could help you with. No. Thank-you. Have a nice day. But they can. You can run an ad anytime you want. - You're sure? - Absolutely. Well, that's good to hear. Look with Charlie running the show, the issue is not getting the time slot you want, the issue is just getting on there. Well, I might try again later. Thanks Randy. All right, keep me posted. I will. Well look who it is. What can I get for you today, gentlemen? Can you make it the small veggie pizza, Shaun. Throw in as many vegetables as you got. Lots of veggies, I got it. Turkey and cheese on wholewheat. I wrote it down before you said it. I'll try the pizza medium but put meat on mine, sausage, pepperoni, a cow. You know, some real food. No problem. I'll take what Ruben ordered, exact same thing. You got it, thanks lads. You know we were at the movies the other night. Most people get popcorn. But this guy, a steak sandwich. Ooh, that sounds good. Gotta have onions and peppers on it though. Hey, I had red and green peppers on it. Yeah, but it cost like 20 bucks. Ah, no that doesn't sound good. You don't mess around, do you Benny. No, sir. If the movie's no good at least I can enjoy a meal. Oh Dave, Dave Dave, heard you broke the streak. Yeah. Well, you gotta go see Explosion. Man, the special effects in that movie will blow your mind. How do you think they do that stuff. I watched a short clip online on how they did that last scene. It said it cost 10 million dollars just to do that one part. Hello again. Stephanie, I was here yesterday, David Williams. Yes, Mr. Williams, how can I help you? Well, I'm back because I'd like to run a spot on your radio station at a special time, 11:59, like I told you before. And like I told you we don't run a spot at that time. Right, but I found out that you could. So, do you think that I can speak with Charlie? It'll just be a moment. I promise I won't take much of his time. Charlie, this is David Williams. Charlie Summers, what can I do for you? Hello. It's nice to meet you. I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am. I know you don't run an ad at 11:59 a.m., but I understand that you could. I was hoping you could make an exception for the spot I want to run. And why is that time so important? It's just the timely ad that has to run then. Well what kind of spot is it? It's an inspirational message. - Religious. - Christian. We don't run anything religious here. But it isn't religious. You just said it was. Well it isn't religious, but maybe it is in the sense you're thinking. Sorry, I can't help you. I'll pay you the fair rate. The answer is no. Charlene Summers, Charlie. She's been in radio her whole life. Husband died 10 years ago of a heart attack, left everything to her. She hasn't missed a beat. As a matter of fact, her ratings are as high as they've every been. She seemed pretty strong willed. Oh, that's putting it mildly. I met her a few times at media functions around town. She's very strong willed. I think you're gonna have to settle for 15 stations. No, we need to be on that one. There's gotta be a way. Well, there's always a way. It's called more of this. Hey, we don't pay overtime here you know. I just finished this. Come take a look. Best month we've ever had and we still have a few more spots left to sell. Good job, Stephanie. Thank-you. And I would've had one of those spots sold but you said "no." - What? - That religious guy today. I have never seen you turn down money before, especially for an ad. I don't need his ad. But if he's got the money what's the big deal. We don't want that propaganda on our station. Have a good evening. Goodnight. Okay, man. The movie starts Friday at 7:05 so close up shop early, we'll meet you at 6:45. And it's the downtown theater this time, the one in the mall doesn't have it. Sorry, Ruben. Sorry, Ruben, what? Can't make it. Did I walk into the wrong office? This is David Williams, right? This is the right place. 'Cause I thought I heard him say "he can't make it." You heard right. So why can't you make it? I just can't. There's gotta be a reason. I'm sorry Ruben, I, I just can't. David, what gives. Huh, nothing. I'm sorry, Ruben. Okay, I'll catch you later, all right. See ya. I'd like to propose that we the money from the outreach budget and place a 60 second radio ad announcing the gospel on all 16 radio station in the city. At the end of the announcement we'll give a phone number that people can call. We will run these ads all at the exact same time. At 11:59 a.m. on any day during the week, we can run an ad on 15 of the stations. They only station that doesn't run an ad at that time is 104.1 who happens to be the largest station, so it's important that we get them too. Have you checked the cost on this? Yes, the cost of running an ad at the desired time slot on 15 stations comes to $1575. For one 60 second advertisement. Well yes, but that's a one minute ad on 15 stations. 104.1 charges $300 to run an at at 11:54 which is when they run their break. So the total would be $1875 if we ran an ad on every station. But the key here is to try to get them to air our ad at the exact time as all the others. That way, regardless of what station they're listening to, they'll hear the gospel. Or turn the dial. But the gospel will be on every station. So no matter where they turn they'll hear it. Then they'll just turn it off. Well that's always an option. Look, I know the program director at 93.5 and he has told me about all the calls that they receive. Their station is definitely reaching people. I like this station. I listen to it a lot during the day myself. They have a good ministry. I think this is a great way to share the gospel with the masses in the city. It sounds like a great way to waste a lot of money to me. 1800 bucks in 60 seconds. Plus, not everybody listens to the radio. Our research showed that a great majority of the people in this city have a radio on at various times during the day. To translate that into numbers for you. It could mean over half a million people would hear the gospel with that one minute ad. So what do you think? Sounds like a plan to me. So they're gonna vote next week? - Yeah. - Do you think they're gonna go for it? Well, I hope so. I felt really good about it. Well you seem pretty excited. Yeah, well maybe the Lord's gonna allow this to happen. Here you go. Thank-you. Well I can tell you did this and not Ruben because there's not one misspelled word on the first page. - I heard that. - He wanted to see you for a minute. Thanks. David, do you have a new guy over there in research helping you these days? No, why? Because that report in your hands is the best work I've seen you do. Something's up. How about the guys in research carry this company and always have. Hah, how about the guys in sales that wants to keep the guys in research in business. I agree with that. Seriously, David, that's some good work. You did a great job. Thanks. Yeah, things have been coming to me a little easier lately. What do you mean? I don't know, I guess you could say I've been less distracted. Well whatever you're doing it's helping. Thanks, I'll see you later. By the way the film me and the misses caught on Friday, you did the right thing, it was awful. Benny and Gerard said they loved it. What? Hey, Monique, I'm doing a little research on radio stations, what station is that? The One. Do you have it on most of the day? Yeah, it's always on. Thanks for the info. Well, hello Jerry. Surprised to see you here today. Is the golf course closed? As a matter of fact, I'm on my way there right now so I only have a minute. Well look, sit down, sit down, what's on your mind? Look, I think we need to get David Williams off the committee. He's a nice guy, but he's going in a different direction that we are. You know he wanting to do these radio ads. David means well. I know. He's reading a book by some guy from Africa and now he's an expert on evangelism. Why don't you have a talk with him, see if he can find another committee to spend his energy on. Well, I don't know if I could do that. Why not? You're the chairman of the committee. He wants to spend all of our budget on something that's gonna flyby in 60 seconds. I mean, come on. Thousands of people will come by our booth over the three days at the expo, it's a no brainer and you know it. Let's just vote on it the next meeting. Okay, but it shouldn't have gotten this far. I'd like to offer you $350 to air my ad on your station just once during that time slot. - $350. - Yes. I understand you normally charge $300, but I have limited funds. Do you know how much this station billed last year? We don't need your $350. I'm not selling anything with it. Doesn't matter. But you have the largest station in the city with the most listeners. And I plan to keep it that way. I know what the people want and I give it to them. Yes, but what people want most of the time is the exact opposite of what they really need. I suppose they really need to hear your religious message. Well yes. Not on my station. Okay. How about $400? No deal. Ms. Summers what's it going to take to run my ad on your station at that time slot? This is really important to you isn't it Mr. Williams? Yes, ma'am it is. You want to run your religious ad on my station at one minute before noon? That's right. Okay, I'll let you run your ad. Thank-you that's very kind of you. For $1500. - What? - Charlie! Cash. Please be reasonable Ms. Summers. I am. I don't want your religious ad on my station. So if it's that important to you, it will be 15 $100 bills, in advance. Have a nice day Mr. Williams. She is crazy. Well that's what she said. You did tell her no. I didn't tell her anything. Well it's obvious she doesn't want the gospel on her station. Well, all the more reason why we need to be on there. You're not thinking about airing that ad for $1500. I don't know what I'm thinking. Even if you are, how are you gonna come up with the money? Well, I was hoping that the outreach community would see the importance of it and agree to it. David, you don't even know if they're gonna vote to do it and now you have to tell them this? - There you are. - Thanks Shaun. - Thank-you. - Hey Shaun, you got that radio on all day. - All day. - What station do you have it on? It's always on The One. I used to play me Irish music but the customers didn't appreciate it. You're a good man, Shaun. See ya. Bye David. Hi, what can I get for you? Hey, any of you guys go to church here? Why do you wanna know? Well, I see you playing ball on our grounds, just wondering? He used to. Does that mean we can't play here anymore? No, you can play here. What's your name? Justin. Where do you live, Justin? This week or last week? What's that supposed to mean? Last week my mom, this week my dad. So your parents are divorced? No, they love each other so much that they live in separate houses. I'm sorry to hear that. All right, let's go guys. We're going to do a secret ballot. You vote for what you'd like to do. We've got the business expo, the basketball camp or the radio ads. I would ask that you just mark one. Don't put your name on the paper. Fold them once and then er, pass them in. Well? Well, the vote was three to two to two. We're doing the business expo again. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I feel like I just lost an election. Well, you got two votes so someone in that room saw it your way. And you tried. What else can you do? Help set the booth at the business expo again, I guess. Ruben, how's the weekend? Hey man, I er, I've got some tragic news about someone you know. What happened? It was in a bulletin yesterday morning. I'm sorry, man. The report said he was trying to witness to a group of fanatics and they beat him to death right there in the middle of broad daylight. He was trying to tell his enemies about Jesus. Where was this? Northern Nigeria. I'm sorry. I just heard Mr. Odum speak at a church not too long ago. Yeah, I saw where he was coming. I even had a chance to talk with him that night for a while. He thought the church in America was in great danger. Danger, what kind of danger? Well, we're sitting there in his hotel, and he started telling me how he thought the devil was deceiving the people in America. David, when you drove up tonight, did you notice the church across from the hotel? Church? Right across from the hotel. I'm sorry I didn't. It had a big sign. You must have seen it. All I noticed was a movie theater. Yes, that is it. The big church. But it was just a movie theater. That my friend is the most powerful church in America. It's a place where thousands go every week for fellowship. I don't understand. The enemy is using the movie theater and other media to accomplish his purpose. I'm still quite not following you. Let me explain. There's nothing sinful about a movie theater, a television or radio. These are all great inventions. What can be sinful though, is the content presented by them. In America you have many Christians who go to the theater, but they do not use discernment about what the devil is doing to them. So why do you call it the most powerful church in America? I will give you an example and show you how powerful the movie theater is in this country. Now what time does your church meet on the weekend? Sunday morning. Let's say I go to your church and preach the morning sermon. Half way through the sermon I curse the name of Jesus or as some would say, I used the Lord's name in vain. Will that not wake up your congregation? So then I preach a little more and I curse his name again. How would they react to that? Then I preach a little more and I curse his name again. Would the people not be upset? Then I bring up a young couple on the platform and they start to kiss and take their clothes off, right there, in church on a Sunday morning. How long do you think your congregation will allow this to go on? Would they not say, "This is most awful thing. "To curse the name of Jesus in church, "and to have them take off their clothes here "in front of everyone." Would they not be appalled? Would they not yell out, "Stop it, you cannot do this in this place." but yet, I say 12 hours earlier, on Saturday night, in a movie theater, when this exact same thing occurs, it is entertainment. My friend, something is wrong. We must make up our mind. It is either entertainment, Saturday night, in the theater, and entertainment Sunday morning in church or it is most sinful Sunday morning in church, and most sinful Saturday night in the theater. This is why I say the movie theater is the most power church in America. It's the only place where Christians go to hear the name of Jesus Christ used as a swear word, and to watch nakedness. And yet pay their money to be entertained. I've never thought of it like that before. I say this trembling David. Most people go to church in America know not Jesus. The bible says in the last days men have become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Is this not the case in America now? Ask yourself, would I go to the movie theater to hear my name cursed? Then why go to the theater to hear his name cursed. David, would you go to the theater to see your daughter naked on the screen? So why go see someone else's daughter naked on the screen. It's this great sinfulness in the eyes of God. I don't know what to say. What can we do? We must try and turn this all around. Use the movie theater for Jesus. We need dramatic programming on television for the Lord. Use radio to tell others the gospel. Satan does not want any of this to happen, and will work to stop anyone who tries to change it. So beware. I understand. The media has the power in this country David. The airwaves, the movies, the music. It is how the enemy is working. Just look around you and observe what really moves the people and influences their lives. Is it not entertainment and the media? They control the people. They have the power of the air. Woo. Depart from me Lord, for I'm a sinful man. Danielle and I used to go to the theater almost every weekend. We also watched a lot of movies during the week. I never thought about any of this. We've all become very desensitized. A few important things he said to me. The world and Jesus are always 180 degrees apart, always. Hollywood is of the world and yet this is our source of entertainment. Second, he said it's not a sin to watch a movie. The issue is what's the message? It's either for the Lord or against him. It's either gonna build you up or tear you down. It's either going to corrupt you or edify you. It's one or the other. And why not choose the Godly? And if the Godly's not available, choose nothing at all. I hear you. One more important thing he said. If you turn away from unGodly movies and media, that doesn't make you right with he Lord. That can just be a work of the flesh. He said we must turn to the Lord first, and the spirit of God will help you turn from these unGodly movies and influences. It's always got to start with the Lord. He needs to be the Lord of our entertainment choices. That man was killed for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I'm having a hard time giving up movies that curse his name. What kind of Christian am I? You know just think, if everyone who went to church in this country decided not to watch anymore movies that cursed his name, or had any sort of nudity in it, or any vulgar language, just think how that would affect the entertainment being offered by Hollywood. That, that would start a revolution. Maybe it's time we started one. Must try and turn this all around. Use the movie theater for Jesus. We need dramatic programming on television for the Lord. Use radio to tell others the gospel. Satan does not want any of this to happen and will work to stop anyone who tries to change it. Use radio to tell others the gospel. Use radio to tell others the gospel. Use radio to tell others the gospel. - I need to do this. - What? Put the gospel on all those radio stations. Think of all the people who will hear about Christ. I agree but how are you gonna pay the cost? - We have some money. - But that's our savings. Well, what are we saving it for? So we can buy something we don't need. David, there's nothing wrong with having a savings. I know, I'm not saying that. I just can't sit around and do nothing. Look, if the Lord wants you to do this then he'll provide a way. He'll get you the money. Maybe he already has. It's sitting in our savings account. Why don't you pray and ask God for some clear direction? Well I did last night and I feel he wants me to do this. Okay, then he'll provide a way. Just keep listening, you'll know. We'll know. Why don't you ask the outreach committee if they wanna help you with the cost. - Huh. - Well, the worst they can say is "No." Okay man, the wife wants to catch some new love story this Friday. It starts at 8:05 so, we'll meet you there around 7:40. Don't be late. Sorry, Ruben, can't make it. Not again. Let's have a cookout instead. We'll invite over another couple, and we've got a new game called Guess What. It's kinda like charades. It'll be a blast. Guys versus the girls, what do you think? Sounds fine, but we're already planning on going to the movie. We'll do that another night. I'm almost thinking about starting a movie ministry at my church. We'd show a movie, once a month on a Friday night. You could start one at your church. I'll help you out with it. Yeah, I guess but, what's up? Why won't you go to the movies with us? This is three times in a row now. Sorry my friend. Yeah, but what's the deal? This ain't like you. You and I have been friends for a long time, and nothing's gonna change that. I just can't go to these movies anymore. How come? They're trying to eliminate the voice of the world and pay more attention to the word or God. He said that they made a decision not to go to films that use the Lord's name in vain or had any nudity in them or even bad language. That's almost all of them. Yeah, I know. And then I read in the mainstream media as much or let they get dictate the way they think about issues and things. David says that the media's almost always preaching the opposite of what the bible says anyway. He's right about that. I didn't even know they were doing this. He also said that it's really made a difference, that their minds have cleared up a lot and they're more sensitive to the things of the Lord now. David wants to start a movie ministry. Instead of going to the theater on Friday nights we'll show a Christian film once a month at a church on a Friday night. He wants to know if we will help. I said I would. Me too. I wanna help too. You know, David's one of my best friends but he's always been more into Jesus than me. And always been more into the movies than him. I'm sorry. I should've been a much better man than that. In that book David was telling me, Mr. Odum thinks that for most people entertainment is not God and not Jesus, and that there's a quick test that we could take. What type of test? He said for one week don't watch any movies or television, don't listen to the radio or any music, don't even get on the internet or read magazines or newspapers. In other words, completely eliminate all types of media and the world of entertainment from your life for one week. Okay. And then the next week go about using the media like you normally but this time you don't pray, you don't go to church, you don't read the bible. You don't even speak about the Lord to anyone and do that for one week. Okay. Now here's the test question, after those two weeks ask yourself, and be completely honest, what did you miss more? "And their dead bodies shall lie in the street "of the great city, and nations shall see their dead bodies "three days and a half." Shall see their bodies. Hey Justin, you got a minute. We're playing man. I just need a minute. All you guys just stop what you're doing. A week from Friday we're gonna be showing a movie at our church. Actually the fellowship hall, that building right over there. I'd like to invite you guys to come and see it. It's free. Why, you got a movie theater in there? No, but we got a big screen and a good sound system. It seats about 150 people. It'll feel just like a movie theater. What's the movie? It's an action packed thriller, guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seats. Yeah, edge of our seats to leave. No thanks man. No, you're right, it's er, it's not an action film. It's actually drama, but you'll like it. Not interested. Hey Justin. Sorry to hear that your parents are divorced and that you have to go back and forth from house to house. That must be really tough. Maybe that's the case for some of you others guys as well. But, if you come see this movie next week, I guarantee the message in this film will help you out in your situation. I guarantee it. Just think about it. Eight o'clock. Well, some of the ladies have volunteered to work the booth at the expo. I think it'd be a good idea if we showed up for a little while to help out. Here's a sheet that notes the times the ladies have indicated they'll be there. Take a look at it and see if you can fit in an hour or two. While you're doing that, David has asked for a minute so he could make an announcement. It's all yours. Thank you. I was reading the Book of Revelation and something jumped off the page at me. It was a truth I had never seen before. I just want to let you know that I'm planning on going ahead with the radio outreach, and I felt like the urgency of this was confirmed in my heart even more from what I read. In Revelation chapter 11, we read about the two witnesses who will be on the earth during the tribulation prophesying for 1260 days. After this time they will be killed, and the bible says in verse eight that "Their dead bodies shall lie "in the street of the great city." And then in verse nine it says, "That the people "and the nations will see their dead bodies for 3 1/2 days." Now, you could read over that and not think anything about it. In fact, I went to a seminary library and I looked up that passage, and every commentary I could find written in the early 1900s or before, and no one could explain those verses. So what are you getting at? It says, "That all the people and the nations will see "the dead bodies of the two witnesses lying in the street." Now how could that happen before 1950? It couldn't. But around 1950 TV started popping up in homes. And today, through TV and the internet, you can see anything you want in the whole world live as it happens. Do you see how significant this is? The technology that has exploded all around us is actually a sign of the end times. I am convinced that we are living in the last days before the return of Christ, and it is the utmost urgency that we share the gospel as much as we can with whoever we can and however we can, and that is key here. People have to hear the gospel for even a chance to be saved. So why are you telling us this? I wanted to see if we could use any of the leftover funds from the citywide outreach for the radio ads. I was hoping that there would be some. Yeah, I think we've pretty much used up the budget with the booth construction, the fees, all the information we'll be handing out. I don't think we'll have anything left. Could we possibly pull from another fund then? I doubt it. This is the only money designated for this type of outreach. Okay. I see. Well, I appreciate any prayers for the radio ads. I'll let you know when we're going to air them. David, David have you ever owned your own company? No Jerry I haven't. I can tell. I know you mean well wanting to do these radio ads, and if you want to waste your money that's your choice, but it's not good business. But it could be good ministry. The expo is both practical and personable. And we get to meet people face-to-face. If you do those radio ads, I bet you won't get one phone call, not a single one. And they're gonna cost what, 18, 1900 bucks. That's a lot of money to waste for absolutely nothing, don't you think? I'm just trying to help. Have a good evening. No Jerry, you're mistaken. It's going to cost 3,075 bucks. Now that's a lot of money for absolutely nothing. Danielle? Hmm? I wanted to let you know that I've been praying about this. I mean, really praying about this. The Lord didn't allow me to meet Mr. Odum for no reason. I asked the committee, even though I didn't feel at peace about asking them anyway, in fact, I don't have peace about asking anybody. I know it's a lot of money if we were to pay for these ads out of our own savings. I told the Lord about it and I've been waiting for him to provide but, so far nothing's happened. Makes me think that he wants me to pay for this. So, could you please at least pray about it and see if you have peace. If you don't then we don't do anything, but at least pray about it, okay? Okay. Thanks. I love you. I love you too. Hey Randy, have you prepared those music reviews for this weekend. Oh Becky, I'm sorry I forgot. You need me to do them? Yeah, if you don't mind. Yeah, no problem. Oh and what about those movie reviews? I haven't seen them yet either. I canceled them. Canceled them? They've always done really well for us. Yeah, I know. I canceled because I can't do them anymore. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. We're gonna start doing reviews for Christian books until I can find some Christian movies. - Okay. - Sorry I didn't tell you. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for helping me. Sure. We caught the Rose Tower over the weekend. Didn't that have Marla Downing in it? - Oh yeah. - In fact it had a whole lot of Marla Downing in it. Did you catch it Ruben? - No, I didn't. - How about you David? - No. - What is happening to you guys? You're slipping on seeing your movies. I think every man in our bible study group saw it. Did it show any nudity? What do you mean? You know what I mean. What are you, the censor board? No. Did it? - A little. - A little, like one scene? A couple, maybe three. You guys have a problem with that? Wait, are we under an investigation here or something? - No. - Then what gives? Come on guys, you know what I'm getting at. We're all Christians here. I mean, do you think it's right that we go see movies that have a woman taking off her clothes on the big screen? Are you implying that we're not Christians if we do? I'm just asking if it's right. - I'm out of here. - Yeah, me too. Guys guys, wait wait wait. What if that woman up on the screen was not Marla Downing? What if that woman was our mother? Or our sister? Or our daughter? Or our wife? I would like to say a brief word to you about the enemy. Satan has one goal for you. He wants you to live your life without Jesus. He does not care what you do just as long as you do it without Christ. Exclude Jesus from your daily life, from your entertainment choices, from the work you do. Keep Jesus out. This is the agenda of the devil. You see the devil knows that in order for people to spend eternity in heaven, they must have Christ in their life before they die. How do they get Christ? By believing the gospel. Before people can believe the gospel, they must first hear it. The devil does not want this to happen so he will do whatever he can to distract anyone from first sharing the gospel, second from hearing it, and finally from believing it. Had a little deal today with Benny and Gerard. What happened? Well, we were at lunch and the subject of movies came up so I spoke up about it. And? It's not worth saying anything Danielle. You just come across condemning and you make enemies real quick. Well what'd they say? Well nothing really. It's just a subject matter where you can't win. I mean, don't try to tell people what they can or cannot watch, and don't try to convict anybody. David Williams, I'm surprised to hear this from you. What? I'm just saying that people can't receive it so why try? So why try? You received it when Mr. Odum told you. Yeah, I guess. It's just hard. So does this mean you're not gonna do the radio ads now? Doesn't look like it. God hasn't allowed anyone to step forward with the money so without that, they don't do them. He just did. Don't ever be ashamed to speak up about Jesus Christ. He wasn't ashamed when he died on the cross for you. Now, I think it's time we share the gospel with as many people in this city who will listen. Hello, Ms. Summers, David Williams. Do you remember me? I have a very good memory Mr. Williams. Well, we're about to run our ad and I wanted to ask you if you'd consider coming down on your price. What did I tell you before? Well you said $1500 ma'am. Well that price still stands. I haven't changed my mind. Like a mentioned before, I have a limited funds, and if you could possibly lower your price, I'd be most appreciative. $1500 Mr. Williams. But that's five times your normal rate. I only wanna air this ad one time on your station. It'll be $2000 if you wanna keep negotiating. Thanks for calling The One. Just a moment. You're not really planning on spending this much money to air your ad are you? Why? 'Cause it's important. Very important. You must really think you're right. I believe the message in the bible's right. But people in different countries believe in different things. I mean who's to say who's right and who's wrong. They could all be right. There can only be one God. The bible says that the Lord is God. For your religion the bible works for you. But for other people's religion they have their own books that work for them. Every religion in the world teaches that man has to do something to get to God. But in Christianity God did something to get to man. There's a big difference. Thank-you for all your help. All right, this may seem a little primitive but it's the best I can offer. We use these phones from time-to-time during the year for call-ins. Well, how many phones do you have? 20. Do you think that'll work for you? Yeah, that should be fine. Well, speaking of work, how does it? Well give me your phone, I'll show you. - Hello? - Can you hear me all right? - Right. - Hold on the line and we'll call the same number again. Hello? Can you hear me all right? Yes. If all the lines are busy, voicemail puts them on hold. Plus, it's a toll-free number. I've already talked to the owner, he said the calls are all on us so there's no charge. - Really? - Yes sir. Thank-you so much Randy. This'll be great. All right, let's go cut that spot. Okay David, you know what you're gonna say? Erm, sorta. Do you have your copy written out? Well, I wrote down a few things. Er David, when we sit down to do a commercial we usually have everything written out. Well, I was just gonna sort of speak from the heart. Okay, say testing one, two, three. Testing one, two, three. Okay, just sit there, talk in your normal voice. I'll give you a signal when you have 15 seconds left, and then I'll count you down from five. All right. You ready? Ready. I counted 37 people so far. Now, that's not gonna break any box office records but for the first movie, not so bad. I think it's great. People like what they see, they'll tell others. Hey, we do this once a month, we're gonna really build a good ministry here. I'm with you, man. Thanks for coming. Well just have a seat anywhere. Movie's about to start. Hey Justin, what made you decide to come? 'Cause what you said was right, man. Going back and forth, in between houses, it's been tough. - Yes? - Mr. David Williams is here to see you. - Who? - David Williams, the guy with the religious ad. Oh Stephanie, I'm so tired of this. Tell him no. He says he has the money. Here's the spot. I'd like to air this Thursday at 11:59 a.m. And here is the payment. Put it on the schedule. Okay. Oh, Ms. Summers. What is it now? Thank-you. What're you working on? I am writing down steps to salvation with bible verses. I figured we could put these by each phone and share with people when they called. That's a good idea. Hey, er, we also need a few more people to help us answer phones. We've got 20 of them. Now, I've already spoken to Ruben and Cindy and they can help us. Randy's in and you and I make five. I can start calling people. Thanks. Oh, and erm, we need a few more radios to help monitor the ads, just to make sure that they air. Now Randy's got several of them but we need a few more. Okay, we need radios. Anything else? Yeah, pray that God uses this. Ú Hey man, this Thursday 11:59 a.m. Be there by 11:45, don't be late. What's playing? Some bible that my buddy did. We'll be there man. I asked them at the front office too. Oh thanks. We need the help. By the way, what's this ad to read? Hey Charlie, you got that CD for the religious ad. I need it for tomorrow. Oh, it's here somewhere. Thanks. Can you believe he paid 1500 bucks to air this thing. I mean, what's he gonna do, change the world in 60 seconds? Stephanie, run the ad at 11:54. - Pardon? - That ad, run it at 11:54. But he paid to have it aired at 11:59. I said 11:54. - But Charlie... - Do we have a contract with him? - No. - Did we sign anything? No. 11:54. Randy, how's it going. David, going good. All right, we're all set. I've got these radios set to the 16 stations so we know we're on the air. I'm gonna need your help to check them all when the ad plays. You got it. Well, how about the phones? The phones are good too. I've already left a message on the voicemail just in case. And do you have enough people coming to help you tomorrow? Well yes, well, some. Danielle got someone to cover her lunch, Ruben and Cindy are coming. We're just trying to get a few more. Sounds good. It's a big day tomorrow. Gospel minute. Yeah, I guess you could say that. Come on, let me show you how to check these radios. - Hey. - Hey. What're you doing? Ah, just thinking. About what? I just spent $3,075 of our savings on one 60 second commercial. It's gonna air on 16 radio stations tomorrow. We're not trying to sell anything. We're not gonna make a penny from this. It sounds kinda crazy doesn't it. Yes it does Mr. Williams. And you're married to the man who made that business transaction. Yes, I am Mr. Williams. We might not get one phone call? That could be, Mr. Williams. I just, want to reach one soul for Christ. And honor Mr. Odum. And that's why I love you Mr. Williams. Do we know if anybody else is coming? Yes, there should be two more. No, make that three. Okay, good. Do you know how many phones we need yet? Ah, not exactly. We think maybe 13, 14. All right, well I'll just set up for whoever comes. Charlie? Where's Charlie? She wasn't feeling well so she went home. Hey Frank, switch the time on that religious ad to 11:59. David, two minutes. Okay everybody, listen up. I'd like to explain what's gonna happen here. At 11:59 a.m. all 16 radio stations in the listening area will be playing a 60 second announcement sharing the gospel. At the end of the ad, a phone number will be given. If your phone rings, I'd like for you to answer, "Jesus loves you, this is David" or whatever your name is. Next to each phone there's a sheet. I've written down some bible verses to help you. I also have a list of good churches you can suggest around the city, and try to tell them about one near where they live if you can. I also have a place to get their name and their phone number if they want to give it to you. Now, we're not trying to talk anybody into anything. This is not a numbers game. I want this to be all God. He has to draw people to himself. So, just listen to the need on the other line and answer appropriately. Any questions? Okay, I wanna thank everyone for helping out today, and I have to admit I don't think I've been anymore nervous in my whole life. 30 seconds. Okay, here we go. In the bible, Jesus Christ said, "I am the light "of the world, I am the bread of life, "I am the door, I am the good shepherd, "I am the true vine, I am the resurrection, "I am the way, the truth and the life." The bible says that Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, was buried and rose again the third day according to the scriptures. It also says that God commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. And lastly, the bible says, "Whoever shall call "upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." If you need help in understanding who Jesus Christ is and what he did for you, please give us a call at 800-555-7500. That's 800-555-7500. The call is free. Thanks for listening and God bless you. All mine aired. Mine too. Lord bless your word that just went forth. Jesus loves you, this is David. I heard this message on the radio and I really feel guilty about a lot of bad things I've done. I need help. Can you help me? Yes sir. Jesus Christ can help you. He absolutely can help you. Jesus loves you, this is Danielle. Yes, I can tell you about Jesus Christ, certainly. Jesus loves you, this is Randy. Absolutely. Jesus loves you, this is Ruben. Yeah, you've got the right place. Jesus loves you, this is Cindy. Yes. Jesus loves you, this is Scott. Well first of all you have to confess and realize that you're a sinner. But we're all sinners. But the bible says, "All have sinned "and come short of the glory of God." We can't get to heaven on our own, or by good works. Our sin is in the way. That's why we need Jesus. He offered himself as a sacrifice for our sins. We believe in Jesus by faith. The bible says, "Without faith it's impossible to please God." Right now you can pray and ask Jesus to forgive yours sins, to come into your life, and to save you. Would you like to do that? God bless you, God bless you very much. Jesus loves you, this is David. Hello this is David, can I help you? Well, I'll just stay on the line. We're here to help you if we can. I'd like to know more about Jesus. I think I need him. We all need him, we all need Jesus, more than anything.
