Oh, how cute! You're so cute! Hey. Hi. I need three iced lattes and a regular coffee. Oh, and extra straws, please! Right. Oh! Put some ice on that, Stan, and ibuprofen for the pain. Thanks, Doc. Yeah. Hi, Levon! Got you a fix. One more here... Oh, hi! Maddy, I did not forget about you. Thanks, honey. And can you help with one more problem? Sure. Thank you. What's the prognosis? Oh... Well, orchids need less sunlight, not more. Here, I'll take care of it. I'll get it back to you next week. Dex and I are going to that wedding this weekend. Oh, and how are things with Dex? Well, last night at dinner, he asked for my social security number. How... Romantic? I think he wants to add me to his retirement account. Or running a credit check? Either way, it's forward motion. Still hasn't popped the question, huh? No, no, but I've dropped a few hints. And, you know, Dex, he can get really distracted when the stocks are down, so I'm just praying for a bull market. Tess, you already missed your 'ring by spring' goal. Well, Australia's spring is in September. And what's going to happen with Dex when you get that fellowship at Northwestern? I don't have the fellowship yet, and, you know, it's tricky with Dex because he loves Boston so much. I don't want to spook him. Sounds like he needs to be spooked to appreciate what he's got in you. Don't worry. I have a plan. And you've got a patient.Oh. Hi, Sam! I hear you're making a miraculous recovery. Hello! I am Dr. Harper, and you are... Nervous. Look, Doctor, uh, before you give me that shot, I've got to tell you, I've got a phobia of needles. So, um... Mmm-hmm. Can you do me a favor and just, uh, could you just hold this for me, and just, um, just be careful because it's really, you know, fragile. But I was scarred when I was a kid. Um, I had a shot, and... Just messed me up. Be careful! Okay, as I was saying, um, I'm a real... Was that the shot? That wasn't bad at all. Rule number one, always keep the patient distracted. Good job. Amber! How's the bride-to-be? Good! I'm excited! I'm going to send you a link to the Commodore Club. It's amazing. It's right on the lake. There's a golf course and a spa, and everybody in the wedding party gets their own bungalow. Well, you've always lived large. Why would your wedding be any different? Anyway, I cannot wait. Hey, how are you holding up? Oh... Did I tell you I'm rethinking the flowers? Again? What is wrong with the Delphinium? Well, I just... I realized that they're going to clash with the bridesmaids' dresses! Okay, okay, remember the advice I gave you about your prom dress in high school? Close your eyes. Shut out the world. Now imagine, what color do you see coming down the aisle? The pink bridesmaids' dresses... And pink does go with blue. So... yeah, I'm going to stick with the Delphinium. Oh, Tessie, what would I do without you? Nothing, 'cause I'll be there soon, and I cannot wait! Does the same go for Dex? Absolutely! We are having dinner tonight to go over all the travel plans. Yay! Yay! Hey. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I stopped by to get that charger that you asked for, and then I popped by home so that I could change, and... You look sensational. Thank you. Let's get a table. I am starving. Oh, hon, there's actually just someone I want you to meet first. Oh, but I've been juggling patients all day. I haven't had anything to eat. Absolutely. What was I thinking? Holbrooke can wait. Mr. Holbrooke? Your new boss? Yeah, I just bumped into him here. I promised him you'd say hello. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's good. We should say hi.Great. Mr. Holbrooke. Dex. I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Dr. Tess Harper. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. She's on staff at Bayside General, and still somehow manages to find time to head the fundraiser for Harborwalk. Really? That's very impressive. Oh, my life is easy. Dex works 10 times harder than I do. Well, Dex, if you pick your stocks the same way you pick your girlfriend, you've got a great future ahead of you. Have a nice dinner. See you, Mr. Holbrooke. Take care, Dex. Thank you. Thanks. You were perfect back there. Thanks for talking me up to Holbrooke. Oh, enough work-talk for one night? Of course. Amber's wedding is finally going to give us a chance to relax. I already booked our flights. Um, day after tomorrow. I got us aisle seats. We have barbecues, golf... I already booked us massages at the spa. Right. Oh, and guess what? Someone from the selection committee for the fellowship is going to be there. He's a friend of Amber's dad! That's great! Yeah. Yeah, I thought the wedding would be a great place to talk to him, and, you know, for us to scope out... Chicago? Again? It's two hours from where I grew up. Plus, I could see my mom more, and your firm has an office there. You could put in for that transfer. I know, I know. I just, I need to wrap my brain around this. Oh, come on. It's Chi-town! The Windy City! Wrigley Field! I prefer Fenway Park. Agree to disagree. Okay. Tess, what do you need Chicago for? You've got everything you need right here. But Northwestern is a leader in innovation. At Bayside, we have to fight over digital thermometers. And, yes, there is a lot to love about this city, but... Tess, let's just get through this week before planning the rest of our lives. Okay. But in the meantime, pack those golf shoes, 'cause we are going to have a blast. Okay. So you've known each other how long? Oh, Amber and I went to grade school, and then all the way through college together. Yeah, it was always Amber's job to get in trouble, and it was my job to come in and fix it. Oh, really? Oh, yeah! Like, when Amber was learning to drive, and she hit a mailbox, I took the fall. When she, like, flooded the dorm with bubble bath, I was the one who found the mops. I would even go on double-dates with her and laugh at her jokes just so they didn't bomb. Typical Tess. But when I get to Chicago, I am going to relax and have fun. You, relaxing? What does that look like? Very funny. I can relax. I can chill. Chillax. Cool my jets. Well, when you get that fellowship at... If I get that fellowship. It is still a long shot. Plus, you know, I have a really nice life here. Is that you talking, or Dex? Okay, you got me, but I'm telling you, after four days in that warm wedding glow, at that amazing resort, Dex is going to fall in love with Chicago, he's going to propose to me, and practically insist that I take that fellowship! And if he doesn't? Knock-knock! I have our seats and our boarding passes for this weekend. I am sorry, Tess. There's been a hitch. Holbrooke came down to my office, and he said he wants to talk about my future, this weekend. He invited me to go yachting! But, Dex, we're going to Amber's wedding this weekend! I know, sweetie, but it's such a great opportunity. But we can't miss the wedding! This is... This is terrible timing. What do you want me to do? Well, come with me! To the wedding! It will mean so much to Amber, and it's going to be a blast. I mean, it's going to be awkward telling Holbrooke I'm going to back out. You already told Holbrooke 'yes'? It was spur of the moment. I wasn't thinking. Oh... Wow. Well, I mean, I guess you can't back out now. It just... This really changes my plans. Your plans? Huh? Oh, uh, you know, just, celebrating... The wedding. Sweetheart, I'll make it up to you. Okay. Well, it's not going to be the same without you. Trust me. Hey! What's up? Hey, Tess! Why aren't you at the airport? Ah, in a few hours. Yes, I'm leaving soon. Where's Dex? Um, well, actually, it's just going to be me for the wedding. Dex can't make it. What? Yeah, he had a work situation come up. I can't believe it! Calm down, Amber. You're the one who should be upset! Well, you know how busy Dex is, and this is just a... Quit making excuses. I mean, not only is he missing my wedding, he's leaving you high and dry. Nonsense. I will be fine. I am fine. Fine. What time does your flight land? At 3:00. I'm heading to the airport now, and... Oh, shoot. What's wrong? I just... I realized that the rental car's in Dex's name. Oh, don't worry. I'll arrange someone to pick you up. Oh, no, you don't have to do that, truly. Hello, Amber? Amber, hello, are you there? I lost you. Uh, yep, still here. Think my WiFi's on the fritz. What? Not again. Oh, are you okay? The wedding planner and I have been clashing over napkin rings. I've got to go, honey. Get here soon, okay? I am on my way. See you soon. Hi! I'm Tess Harper. Yeah, Michael. Got any bags? Oh, just a few. I travel light. Okay, great. Yeah. Whew! Wow. This is traveling light, is it? Well, it's a four-day wedding. I need a lot of outfits. Oh, oh, please be careful with that one! Oh, and that one, too. Why, what you got in here? Um, well, shoes. A lot of shoes. That's a lot of shoes. Yeah... Okay. You know what, you can just hop in if you want. I'll get you there real quick. I know Chicago like the back of my hand. Why don't you have a sticker? A what now? A sticker? You know, the... Ride-share sticker? Oh, a sticker? Yeah... Yeah, they don't give them to all of us, so... Are you sure you don't want to ride up in the front with me? I'm good. Yeah. Okay. 'Cause I'm not a chauffeur. I'm the best man. Oh! Front? Yeah. Doc. That was a dirty trick you just played. Trick? You're the one who made the assumption. And you had the chauffeur sign. Amber said, 'Go to the airport and pick up Tess.' She's getting super stressy with the wedding flowers, and I was more than happy to get out of that insanity. She's stressed already, and it's day one. Poor Amber. That's the problem with weddings. Oh, you have a lot of experience with weddings, huh? Yeah, you could say that. So are you opposed to all weddings, or just this one? You know, I do love the perks, though, the golf and the music, and the fun, but the stress and the traditions? Not so much. But you've got it all backwards. Weddings are not about the perks. It's about the people! You want to know the truth? Weddings are only fun if they're not your own. Wow, I really hope that is not your wedding speech. You know what? That's a really good idea. I hope you're not expecting a tip. Can you turn that down, please? What? You don't like Chicago's best blues? Well, I like my eardrums more, and at over 80 decibels, it can trigger tinnitus. Tinni-whoda-what-now? It's a medical term for a, you know, buzzing sound or ringing in the ears from exposure to loud music, your loud music. Fine. Okay. Your loss. Thank you. Could you just take it a little slower around these curves? I'm going to really need that massage tomorrow. Yeah, you need to relax. Are you sure this is the right way? Are you kidding me? I grew up around here. I'm like a human map of the Greater Chicago area. What's the use? Right? Stop your grousing and just enjoy this beautiful scenery. And you're positive we didn't take a wrong turn somewhere, or... Trust me. The Commodore Club is just up ahead here. So you and Amber, you've known each other a long time, huh? Yeah. Yeah. We've known each other our whole lives. It's actually funny going to her wedding, 'cause when we were young, we used to marry our stuffed animals. I remember one time, a teddy bear and a sheep made the perfect couple. Until one of them realized he was a carnivore. Way to ruin the memory. Don't blame me. That's just how nature works itself out. Um... Are we here? Can we... You know, I can walk, actually. I could just get out and walk. You want to get out? Yeah, I could. I mean, are we... I guess we could stand each other for a few more seconds. The Commodore Club is right up here. Not a moment too soon. ...interesting. Yeah. Well, thank you for picking me up. It was an interesting ride. No problem. I hope you weren't serious about that no-tip thing? Oh. Well, here's a tip. Always wear sunblock. Gee, thanks. So what do you do when you're not picking people up from the airport? I'm a lawyer. Ah, well, that explains why you weren't so forthcoming about who you are. A divorce lawyer at a wedding is like bringing a baby to the movie theaters. You get a lot of dirty looks. Mmm. Or maybe it's just you. Ouch. So which way is Amber? There's a group gathering out on the club patio. So I'm just going to run this over to your bungalow. Thank you. You sure you're all right with that little one? Oh... Really? Oh, thank you so much. I was joking. No, that's so nice of you. I'm going to take it. Uh, which way? This way? That way? No, that's, that's where the reception is, so you're going to probably want to check in first. Oh, no, no, no, there's no time for that. I'm already running late, and Amber has a tendency to freak... Tess! Out. Hi! I'm so glad you're finally here! Oh, my gosh, what's wrong? Are you okay? Where do I start? The cake is gone. The wedding planner quit, and my wedding vows, they just, they read like a ransom note, and there's a million things that I... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I'm here, okay? Just breathe. Okay. I've got this. Okay? Okay. Good. All right. Go back inside. I'll be in there in just a sec. I'll see you out there. Okay. Thanks for coming. Yeah, all right. Jack! How you doing? Tessie! You made it! Any groom jitters? Are you kidding? I've never been more sure of anything in my life. Right answer. Oh, I think my uncle just discovered it's an open bar. I'd better go keep an eye on him. Tess! Hi, Bernadette! Wow, I haven't seen you since our, what, our college reunion? Can you believe it? Us, bridesmaids! Ahhh! Yeah. Ahhh! Oh, mother of the bride alert. Tess. Hi, dear. How lovely to see you. Where's that handsome boyfriend of yours? Oh, well, he had to stay behind in Boston for work. What? His loss. Uh-oh, here comes Aunt Millie. Batten down the hatches. You know what she's like. Oh, my, aren't you pretty? You know, there are a lot of eligible young men at this wedding. Oh, uh, truly, no need. Mr. Tilton! Oh, she's so adorable! Tess, dear! You made it. How are you holding up? Oh, smooth sailing. Never better! Oh! Frankly, Tess, I'm terrified. It's as if Amber and her mother are speaking some kind of, I don't know, foreign language, Wedding-ese. I mean, they ask me questions, but I sense I'm not supposed to say anything, so do I answer, or don't I? It'll all be over soon. Uh-huh, and quite likely, I will be, too. Amber! Whoa. Okay, I like mimosas as much as the next gal, but at the rate you're going, they're going to run out of orange juice in Florida! Bernadette keeps telling me a story about a bride who can't fit into her wedding dress! So... Isn't it obvious? She's trying to get into my head! Oh. Oh, no. I'm sure she's just trying to be funny. You look beautiful... And nervous. Oh, honey, honey, did you connect with the steakhouse yet? Jack's friend is catering the reception dinner. Charlie's got all the orders A-okay. Best steaks in town. And you didn't forget the seven vegan meals, right? The vegans are cool. It's all handled. And you're gonna help your mom with the slide show? Amber, on it. Relax, okay? Take care of her. Yeah. Okay? See you. Jack is as cool as a cucumber, and I am falling apart. Ever since the wedding planner left, everything is a mess! Oh, relax. I'm sure everything can be handled with a few phone calls. What is this I hear about an AWOL wedding cake? The baker was supposed to check in days ago, and this is a very special wedding cake that I designed myself, with meringue hearts, there's a custom topper, and 'Love Forever' written in marzipan. Do you have a number for this bakery? It's somewhere in the wedding planner's notes. All right. I am calling them right now. Oh, thank you, Tess. I knew you would help. Our bakery is permanently closed at this location... Oh. Well, uh, there's a reason you haven't heard from the bakery. The recording says they're closed. For the day? For forever. Gone out of business. But... But they have Daddy's deposit! Oh, this is not good. See, the wedding planner is supposed to be handling this. Yeah, what exactly happened with the wedding planner? She was super-opinionated. Isn't that why you hire one? Yeah... But, I mean, we were clashing from day one. And then we got in the teeniest little tiff over place-settings, and she just quit! Okay, well, it sounds like you need a new bakery, and fast. Would you? Oh, Tess, you are the best! Oh, uh, well, I'm... Yeah, you know, I made it through med school. Think I can handle a cake. Oh, but you will need a driver. Huh? Michael! Oh, no. Oh, yeah, no, I'm fine. Tess, I'm not going to trust you to some Chicago cabbie. Michael! Yeah, me? Yeah, no, I'm... I'm good. Yeah, she's good, whatever it is! Tess, Michael is from Chicago, and you wouldn't mind driving Tess to some bakeries, would you, Michael? Uh... Jack just rented this boat, and we're going to go fishing on the lake, and all the groomsmen are going. Yes, please, go! Yeah, I wouldn't want to get between you and a fish. Okay, guys! As maid of honor and best man, it is your duty to help. Right, okay. Of course. Of course. Yeah, and Michael will help, right? Right! Fine. You guys are the best. Thanks! Okay, so, well, I'm going to start googling bakeries, and you go pull the car around. Okay, fine. Just remember, I'm a lawyer. I'm not a chauffeur. Okay, well, maybe you could make a motion toward the parking lot? Very funny. I thought so. Can you move a little quicker, please? I'm supposed to be fishing, not on some crazy cake hunt. Oh, you're not the only one making sacrifices. I had to move my shiatsu massage until tomorrow. Besides, helping a wedding is a noble cause. Who made you wedding planner? Everyone knows when you lose a wedding planner, there is a clear line of succession, starting with the maid of honor and the best man, all the way down to the flower girl. Okay, none of that is true. Do you honestly want to trust crazy Aunt Millie with the wedding? Purple scarf? No, but I don't understand why you and I have to be roped into this thing! Well, Jack is your best friend, right? Yeah. Amber's mine, so let's just steer this wedding clear of the icebergs, okay? Oh... Oh, for cracking ice! Look at this. Jack's cousin just caught a trout. The lucky stiff. Oh, stop your bellyaching. I am saving you from sunburn and sea sickness. Great bedside manners, Doc. Oh, here it is! I have a great feeling about this place. I'm not quite sure I follow. Can you run that by me again? Well, for a wedding cake, we'll simply make four layers, and then we'll nix the lollipops and keep the bow! Right... Right! Oh, wow. Can we get a dozen of these? Eleven to go? Oh! Ah... Sorry. So, you need a wedding cake ASAP? Have you two thought this through? What? Yes! No! No, no, no, no, no. It's not for us. This is what the bride wants. 'She' does, huh? Quite the list. Can you do it? Of course. We are the best bakery in the city. And that is why we came to you first. Why don't you have a look around, and I'll total this up. These cakes are the perfect metaphor for a wedding. Treacle syrup, assortment of nuts, and just as expensive as a small house. Why are you so cynical about weddings? Weddings are wonderful! I don't understand why people would want to spend a small fortune on something that fails 55% of the time. When Amber and I were little girls, we snuck under a hedge and watched my neighbor's backyard wedding. It was magical. You know, what's magical is how a nest egg can just disappear. Trust me, in my line, I have seen couples where that money should've been spent on couples' counseling, not on a wedding. I'm starting to see it now. What? Yeah, I'm a doctor, and I completely missed the symptoms. This is personal, all of this wedding-bashing. Wedding bashing? The wedding still on, you two? Wow. That's ridiculous! So is your timeline. I don't suppose you would consider knocking that price down for us just a little bit, do you? I really like your bakery, and I could put a good word in with the mayor. He's getting married in the spring. You know the mayor? Yeah, I got him on speed-dial. We went to law school together, and I helped him pass ethics. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Ethics? Ethics, yeah. I've got to say, I was super impressed with you today. Fighting to get a better price on that cake. Maybe change your opinion about weddings? No, I just couldn't bear to see you steamrolled. Yep, still you. Tell me you got a cake? Oh, no. Victory! You guys, thank you so much! Oh, you two make a great team. Like orange juice and toothpaste. Still you. But see? Doesn't it make you feel good, seeing her that happy? Yeah, totally. Okay, that was so not heartfelt. By the way, good job playing backup today. So you're saying I'm like your nurse? Oh, no, I would never say that. Nurses are heroic and devoted to their work. And I'll be leaving now. See you at the ceremony. Not a moment sooner. Works for me. Hey! Howdy. How's it going, bud? Hi. Hi. So... what's his deal anyway? Michael? He's Jack's college roommate. They go way back. He's cute, huh? Oh, well... Whatever. I mean, he certainly thinks very highly of himself. Well, you've got good hair, so he makes up for it. Well, all I know is, you guys are rock stars for getting that cake, and I'm sorry I've been so stressed this week. Well, rule number one. Always keep a stressed patient distracted. So what do you think about a round of golf in the morning? You're on. Welcome, all. I just want to thank everyone for joining us here for this very happy occasion. Now, everybody, go find your bungalows, because we've got four days of fun and festivities to look forward to. Cheers! How was that? Very well done. Nice. I know! It's happening! You've reached Dex. You know what to do. Hey, Dex. I was just calling to let you know I got in okay, and that I miss you. Wish you were here. You would really love this place. Okay. Bye. Isn't this great? Getting out, getting some fresh air, some exercise, getting your mind off of the... The wedding? Yeah. Yeah, this is a good stress reliever, and I clearly needed it. So... Jack's been acting strangely. How so? Last night, I wanted to go over the seating chart, and he was absolutely nowhere to be found. I mean, I just... I don't get it. He's usually so reliable. Do you think this is a sign of things to come? I'm sure it's just a case of nerves. Yeah... Oh, speaking of nerves, would you like to write my wedding vows? Hah! Your fifth-grade paper on pilgrims is one thing, your wedding vows, that's something else. But I did get an 'A' on that paper. Yeah, and ironically, I turned mine in late. Hey, you know what? Let's go lose ourselves in some waffles. Yeah, uh... Oh, darn. Oh, that's my Aunt Karen from the airport. Her flight keeps getting bumped. Oh, no. You go ahead. I'll meet you there. Okay. Beautiful place, Mr. Tilton. Yes. It puts the 'pretty' in 'costs a pretty penny.' Well, hopefully, when it's all said and done, it will be worthwhile. You're here alone, aren't you? Yes. You don't bring a date to a wedding unless you're pretty serious. Well, I met my wife at a wedding. You know, there are a lot of very attractive bridesmaids. Pass. I'm very happy being single right now. Famous last words. You turn a corner and bump into a certain someone, and all bets are off. Fickle finger of fate. I love the alliteration, but... Not gonna happen. Let me guess. You took one on the chin and you never recovered. Failed romantic becomes a cynic. I think you're forgetting what I do for a living. Every marriage begins with the best of intentions. I think this conversation's getting a little heavy for the putting green. Yeah. I think you're right. Jack and Amber are meant for each other, so none of this applies to them. I'll see you at the buffet brunch? Oh, yeah. I've been starving myself all morning. Don't forget. We've got a 2:00 tee time. Wouldn't miss it. What's up with the name tags? Oh, it's a game to help guests get to know each other! You get the name tag with the name of a famous person put on your back... And then you get somebody to help you guess who you are. So, Tess, any clues who I am? Oh, uh, you dropped out of Harvard and became one of the richest men in the world. Oh, I wish. Then I could afford this wedding. Henry, you promised. Tess, dear, make sure you get something to eat. Oh, and any hints? Who am I? Oh, you like to solve mysteries. Think British. It's elementary. Sherlock Holmes? Right you are. Oh, perfect. Now maybe I can solve the mystery of that missing boyfriend. Abandoning a pretty girl like you? Oh, wow, I'd better hurry. They're almost out of waffles. Mildred? Enjoying the perks? Got about a day's worth of calories on that plate. Yep, um, I'm carb-loading. I've got 18 holes of golf out there with my name on them, right after brunch. Here, help me figure out who I am. Hmm? Oh, you're immature. You enjoy winning and giving orders. Ah... Napoleon? Oh, you're talking about the game? Come on, tell me who I am. You're Peter Pan. Ah. All right. You are a woman, you led an army, and you're a martyr. Joan of Arc. Very fitting. Old friend? No, that's Dr. Hastings. He's the head of the medical board at Northwestern. I have never met him, but I certainly would like to. Well, here's your big chance. I just don't know what I would say. I mean, you could start with something like 'hello.' Yeah? Okay, here he comes. Here he comes. No... And there he goes. I am getting paged. What, by a patient? No, by the bride. Ah... Hi. I just talked to my Aunt Karen and she's not going to be here on time... Can you do help? Can you do it? Yeah. Thanks. Put down that bacon. We've got a task. Again? Oh, no, no, no, no. No. And you think I am happy about this? Amber's Aunt Karen was supposed to do something big for the wedding, and she missed her flight. Yeah, but I have a tee time, and I'm going golfing, and you should be getting your massage that you scheduled. But the bride needs her something-blue. What is that? 'Something old, something new, 'something borrowed, something blue?' Right, but what is the 'something?' I don't know yet! You know what? You just go play golf, but just answer me this before you go since you know this city like the back of your hand. Is there, like, a really good vintage accessories place? What? In English? Like, an antique jewelry store. Oh. Um... I might... Know a place. Okay, great. Thank you. Let's go. We don't have time. You're going to starve! I'm taking my bacon. It's a perfect day for golf. Oh, quit sulking. Anyway, helping people is its own reward, and besides, as maid of honor and best man, it is our... Sacred duty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but Jack Nicklaus just designed this golf course back there, so... And look, I loved him in Chinatown, but can we please get this dog and pony show on the road? Okay, wait, what? Where did that expression come from? Do you know? Well, obviously, the dog needed a sophisticated touch, so they added a pony. No, no, no, the pony needed to appeal to the masses, so they added the dog. Is everything an argument with you? Wow, you really are a lawyer. Can we go, please? Can you put down that... I don't... Hold it. Ugh. Okay, I'll hold it. Yeah, thank you. Oh, I hate to say it, but this place looks perfect. Let's head inside. Look, I think I'm just going to wait out here. I don't want to go in, so... It's a jewelry store, not a haunted house. Come on, help me pick something out. Ah, look! Something blue. All done. Let's go. Um, a keychain? Yep. I mean, look at that. To unlock the secrets of each other's hearts. It's poetic. Okay, Amber is not going to pin a keychain to her wedding dress. How do you even know about this place? I... I just do. Fine, be mysterious. Oh, look at that! Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Can we go now? Oh, you know what? No. Amber was swarmed by dragonflies when she was young. She still has flashbacks. Yes! Mmm, that... Is perfect. Really is. What are you staring at? Hmm? Oh, nothing. It's just that it matches your eyes. Oh, you know what? I think it's a little... I think it's a little flashy. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Listen, why do you even ask for my opinion if you're just going to ignore it? Oh, 'cause when it comes to weddings, you have everything backwards. I ask for your opinion, so then I can do the opposite. That's ridiculous. Okay, something blue... Honestly! That is exactly what is wrong with weddings. The traditions, the pitfalls. They turn what is supposed to be some great party into one big buffet of stress. You just don't get it, because a big event like this for you, all you have to do are the three S's. Ah, the three S's. Yeah, shower, shave, and show up. That is not how I remember it. But the bride is under so much pressure. She's got the planning, the organizing, the budgeting, and then also, like, the juggling of family, and old friends from college, even exes, all the while trying to look gorgeous in a dress. Wow. You have really put some thought into this. I'm just saying, most of the heavy lifting falls on the bride's shoulders, so cut Amber some slack. Uh-huh. Amber has been in Chicago long enough. She can handle it. They don't call us the City of Broad Shoulders for nothing. Yeah, what does that even mean? You know, it's the line in the Carl Sandburg poem 'Chicago, ' and it means we work hard here, and even if that work isn't pretty, and even if it hurts, Chicago people push through. We do what we have to do to get things done. What? Oh, uh, just actually sounded poetic. Thank you. Is something wrong with you? And it's how I know that your boyfriend is not from Chicago. And how's that? Because he doesn't do the heavy lifting, like flying here for a wedding. That is really ugly. Then it must be perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh. Again? I've got to take this. Yep. No problem. Hi. Who were you talking to back there? Oh, that was Michael. Yeah, we're out shopping for jewelry. Who? Michael. He's the best man. Yeah, we're just helping Amber out. You know, the bride, she needs her something... Hey, Tessie, I need your help. How soon do I need to take that sea sickness medication before yachting to be absolutely positive? Oh, just a couple of hours. Got it. Thanks! Hey, look, I've got to run, babe. I'll call you later. Well, how... Miss you. Bye. Okay, bye. Everything okay? Boyfriend troubles? Everything's fine. Thank you for caring. Oh, I have to pay for the... I already took care of it. It's for a noble cause. You're welcome. They're probably around the twelfth hole by now. Don't you feel some deep sense of satisfaction, playing such a role in someone else's happiness? No, I feel a deep void where the golf would have gone. Are we done? Yes, thank goodness. So you can go join your friends.Yes. And I finally get to relax, too. Ah, now you're starting to get it. Tess! Huh? We're headed to the spa, and you're coming. Finally. Tess? I've been meaning to talk to you. Now, you know about computers, right? Sure. Why do you ask? Well, it's the slideshow for the rehearsal dinner. Jack was supposed to help me, but I can't find him anywhere, and I'm in way over my head. Tess, but you're due at the spa right now. I... I can help. Oh! Thank you, honey. Bye, Michael! Now, you'll have time to get to it... Bye. ...before the barbecue meet and greet. Thank you, Tess. You and Michael have been such lifesavers. So, what do you, what do you think of him? Oh, he's like a foggy X-ray. I can't figure him out. Hey, hon, I'm going to head back to the kitchen, and grab some more marshmallows and stuff for the s'mores, okay? We need 'em. And there he goes again, the amazing vanishing groom. Stop worrying. There's mountains of marshmallows. He just keeps making excuses so that he can disappear. He was AWOL for hours today. He was probably with his groomsmen. No, no! The groomsmen were at the gym. Not Jack. Oh, God, Tess, what if I'm making a huge mistake? What do you mean? Well, I love Jack, but we are very different people sometimes. I am a morning person. He's a night owl. Jack loves the beach. I hide from the sun. I mean, I love to dance. I think Jack would rather be tortured than dance. Okay, Amber, do you remember the first day of college when your keys went missing, and you thought for sure your roommate had stolen them, and the whole time, they were in your nightstand, and everything was fine? Yeah. You are a worrier. It's just what you do. I know. And you know the best thing for cold feet? No. Circulation! Oh. So go get that party started. Please, go move those feet.Okay. Doctor's orders. I'm going. Uh-oh. What kind of a greeting is that? Well, you know, every time I see you, we get dragged into some kind of a task. That's actually true. How was the rest of your day? It was great actually, yeah. Finally got that round of golf in. And I'm really sorry you got roped into that presentation. I tried to help you. And thank you for trying, but what choice did I have? I mean, no one was lifting a finger, and Mrs. Tilton gave me the photo album, and there was a scanner in the business center. Well... At least you get to enjoy all of this. Looks like it's going to be a beautiful night. This sunset, the fire coming, and your laptop. Wow! Okay. For such an organized person, I did not expect to see such a cluttered desktop. That's impressive. 'Innovations in Bone Density Scanners'? 'Advances in Podiatry Treatments'? I like to be cutting-edge. I have, like, 50 medical papers to read, in my fun-time. Promise not to invite me to your fun-time. Oh, I promise. A hundred seconds of solitude? Hmm? What? Oh. Yeah, of course. What was I thinking? Had to check on the florist. No stone unturned. Hey, Tess? Can I make an observation? In the 48 hours that I've known you, you pass up a golf game, you've eaten only when forced to, and you missed a spa day so that you could work on a slideshow presentation. And your point? My point is, all these guests here, they're having a blast. When are you going to join in? Well, it just seems like people keep needing my help. That's because you let them. Ever heard the phrase, 'Doctor, heal thyself'? Look, there is a silver lining to me being busy this weekend, and that is that it takes the focus off of me. I swear, if Bernadette asks me where my 'missing boyfriend' is one more time, I am going to snap. And where is your missing boyfriend? Ha. Very funny. Thank you. I just have to survive yoga with her tomorrow, and then I can have some peace. Oh, carb-loading again? Last two skewers on the barbie, and one's got your name on it. Don't confuse me by being nice. Fine, I'll eat 'em. No, I'll... What? What is it? It's Dr. Hastings again. Oh, yeah, the guy from the brunch. What is his deal, anyway? I'm up for this fellowship at Northwestern, and he is on the selection committee. Ah, so... Go say hi. Hmm? No, no, no. Well, he's having dessert, you know, so... Uh-huh. Okay, so, if you get the fellowship, does that mean you're moving to Chicago? Oh, um, I don't know. It's complicated. Ah, the boyfriend doesn't like Chicago. Oh, you just think you have everyone's number, don't you? Yeah. I can't help it. After years and years of patterns, they just start to form. Like, for example... See those two right there? Yeah? He just met Jack's cousin and she really likes him, but she doesn't know how he feels about her. Well, how does he feel about her? Well... I know it looks like he's wondering if his kebabs are overcooked, right? But... He likes her. He likes her a lot. Wow! Yeah. Good work. I'm impressed. Thanks. Yeah, you know, in my line, you get so you can just glance and understand people's love lives. All right. All right. You're using your professional skills. I'm going to use mine. The patient's acute cynicism suggests a build-up of antibodies to weddings, perhaps from a prior trauma? Oh, wait, let me guess, commitment-phobic? No. I mean, yes... Okay, a couple, two or three years ago, I was engaged... Emily... And I just went with the flow, sunk a ton of money into a big wedding that she wanted. You know, the whole hoopla, the string quartet, and the... Doves. You? Did not see that one coming. Yeah, I was all in, everything but the break-dancing bears. Oh. Then, three months before our wedding, she met somebody else, and at a wedding, ironically. Ouch. Yeah, and then, you know, the jewelry store today... No! Don't tell me. That's not where you got the ring! And where I returned it. Oh, Michael... Wow. I'm really sorry. It's in the past. Yeah. Right? Yeah! Hey. To Jack and Amber. To Jack and Amber. The last two skewers. You know, I actually studied to practice environmental law. So, why divorce law? I don't know, I just kind of fell into it. I took a couple cases at the beginning, and turned out I was really good at it. You know, we both work in fields that involve pain. My specialty is making it quick and painless, but I'd like to switch fields some day. So why don't you put out some feelers to law firms you actually want to work with? You know, you could... Tess, stop. I am the one person that doesn't need your help. I'm fine. Well, this is me. I'll see you tomorrow, and thanks for dinner. It was... Interesting? Exactly. Good night. Good night. And good luck with bridesmaids' yoga. Be strong. And we greet the morning as we complete our sun salutations, moving into Warrior I, welcoming peace. Tess? Tess! Are you sure I did the seating plan okay? Yes! There's not too many strangers sitting together at each table? No. No, you're good. I checked. And reaching for the earth, embracing a calming inner light. So this missing boyfriend of yours, what's his deal anyway? Focus, please. And back to center, placing the elbow on the knee and twist. And how long have you been going out for? Almost two years. And he still didn't come with you? I'll tell you why he isn't here. He's afraid he's going to have to put a ring on that finger. It is not that at all! Ladies! Shh! You have to turn the screws, honey. That's how I got Henry to propose. Hey, Tess! Michael? What? What are you doing? Come with me if you want to live. Namaste. That does not seem relaxing. Most tense yoga session ever, actually. The Dalai Lama would not have approved. Why do girls talk like that when they're working out? Guys just work out when they're working out. Anyway, forget about all that and hurry, or we're going to be late for our tee time. What? I'm not playing golf. Sure you are... With them. What? Yeah, I ran into them this morning at the Pro Shop, and since they were looking for a foursome, and you wanted to meet Dr. Hastings... What are you doing? I'm helping you help yourself. I've got to go change! Okay. I'll get the cart. You're gonna like this course. The greens are nice... Dr. Hastings? Dr. Harper. When they were kids, Tess here used to perform surgery on Amber's broken dolls. And from what I hear, Tess's golf game is as good as her bedside manner. Dr. Hastings, in full disclosure, I'm a finalist for the fellowship at Northwestern. Perfect. We can enjoy our golf game and talk about anything besides work. Bedside manner? I should have said bedside manner first, then golf game after. I don't know if bedside manner needed to be included at all. I know. So for my money, the best steak in Chicago, Benny's Chop House, hands down. Oh, I'll be sure to check it out. Ah! The bride has a question. I'm sure it can wait. Devoted to golf. I respect that. Yeah, except I think this wedding is making me lose my mind. Oh! Terrific. Well... Wedding planner, says I still owe her five grand. No matter. Yes, dear? Fine. I'm sure if they don't have posies, then mums are fine. How much extra? Uh-uh. No. Fine. Yep. You know, I thought this wedding would be a simple get-together, but now there's harpists, there's a cheese sommelier, there's more food than an army needs. There's a charging station by the sangria bar. I mean, this isn't a wedding, it's a, it's a... It's a runaway train. Mr. Tilton! Henry? Oh, oh, oh, okay. Michael, will you get the cart and some water, please? Yep, on it. Take some deep breaths, okay? Do you feel dizzy or cold? No. Okay, just breathe. I'm okay now. Yeah, I think it was just a mild panic attack and maybe a little dehydration. You know, I'd really, really like to get you out of the sun and rehydrated. Thank you. And up to the clubhouse. Do you think you can get up okay? That sounds like a good idea.Yeah. Listen, all of you, you play on, okay? Sorry, sir, not a chance, no, no. I need to re-check your vitals inside. Here. Here, actually, I'll take this for you. I think we've had enough excitement for one day, yeah? Just breathe. Thank you. Good work out there. Good bedside manner. Thanks for the assist. Look out, watch your head. Okay. Ready? We're good? You're clear, yeah. Go ahead.Okay. Not on the green! You guys are going to love the dance lessons. Oh, are we? Uh, just... Yep. You were pretty great out there, and I think Dr. Hastings took notice. That was a nasty trick you played, surprising me with golf, and a nice one. Uh, Jack? Honey, let's start. Ooh, yeah, actually, I'm going to have to sit this one out. What? Why? Hmm? Oh, I... I did something to my hamstring playing golf today. Oh, you know, dancing might help stretch that hamstring out. You sure? It's, like, it's really sore. Okay, yeah. You should probably ice it and keep it inclined. Thanks, Doc. I better get some ice, honey. You know, doctor's orders, so... I'm sorry. It seems super fun. But he... He's the one who needs the dance lesson. He's got two left feet! And I want to look good for our wedding dance. This is really important to me! It... Maybe you're right about weddings making people crazy. Huh, you're beginning to see the light. Partner up, people. We've got lots to learn, and only an hour. Uh, partner up. Seems like we're being tasked again. Come. Positions. And... Well, I should warn you, I am a little rusty. Whoo. And you're really good. Fringe benefit of my near-miss wedding. My fiancee forced me to get lessons for a ridiculous wedding dance that never actually happened. Oh, don't blame it on the wedding dance. Why not? Because the wedding dance is, it's beautiful. It's romantic. It's the first steps a new couple takes together, under the lights and with the music. Wow, you are a hopeless romantic, aren't you? Emphasis on the 'hopeless.' Whoa! Ooh! Good. You've got some moves. Well, the ER is a bit of a dance, you know, evading gurneys, dodging bedpans... Yeah, I got it. Yep, yep.Okay. Oh, no. What? Aunt Millie's all alone. As sorry as I feel for Aunt Millie, you and I are here, on the dance floor. Yeah, but that's the whole thing about a wedding, right, is everybody gets to join in the fun. It's okay. Fine. Oh... Oh, you know what? I have to take this. I'll be right back, okay? Dex! Hi! Are you ready for your trip? All systems go. Don't forget your Dramamine. Done. And how's it going with you? Uh, actually, surprisingly fun. What's all that noise? Oh, it's music. Just a little dancing going on. See everything you're missing? Hey, hold on a sec. I've got to get rid of another call here. Hello? Hello... Dex? Hello? Ugh. Quick, quick, slow, slow. Quick, quick, slow, slow. Move faster with that one. Slow. Quick, quick, slow, slow. Yes... Slow, slow. Quick, quick, slow. There is nothing like Chicago pizza. Well, you won't be without it much longer, right? Mmm? Yeah. Let me guess. Dex hasn't agreed to Chicago if you get the fellowship? Okay, it's fine. You don't want to talk about it. I won't twist your arm. I've got enough on my mind already. Is that... No. Wha... Jack! Hey, hon. What are you doing, creeping around? What? Uh, I was just getting some ice for my hamstring. Yeah, I don't want to limp down the aisle. That wouldn't be good. Uh, but you guys have fun, okay? Better go before the ice machine closes, though, so, I'll see you guys in a bit. What is he up to? Sneaking around, ducking out on duties. Amber... 'Boyfriend Jack' is wonderful, but what if there is a 'Married Jack' that I don't know yet, who keeps secrets, and doesn't care about the things that are important to me? Oh, Amber, where do I start? Tess, am I getting cold feet? You should really talk to Jack about these worries. Communication is the best medicine. I know, I know, but I'm afraid to. It's the wedding week. I don't want to have a big showdown. I just wish that he would make an extra effort once in a while. And, Tess, you deserve that, too. Don't give me that look. You don't think you deserve the same thing from Dex? Look, we are talking about you right now. Yeah, well, don't worry. Cold feet aren't contagious. Well, don't you worry. You are going to have the fairytale wedding you have dreamed of since we were kids. I promise. That was very sweet of you back there, asking Aunt Millie to dance. Hey, she's got a fantastic foxtrot. I may have misjudged you a little. Yeah? I think it's possible that I might've misjudged you just a tiny bit, too. Hmm. So listen, tomorrow's a pretty big day. We have the rehearsal, you have your slide show, but I was thinking... Oh, you are not suggesting we play hooky on our wedding duties. No, we still help with the wedding, but then we also take some time for some R&R, some fun! Yeah? Best of both worlds. What do you think? Deal? Deal. Yeah. And good night to you, too. Okay. What a great way to start the day. You mind if we stop, just for a minute? Oh! I thought for sure you'd be able to keep up. Well, A, I did keep up, and B, it's three times around the golf course. It's a lot of running. But you're a lawyer. I thought you'd be especially long-winded. Ha, that's very funny. Can we just take a little break? Break? This is... I'm supposed to be having fun today. Yes, fun, but not at my expense. All right, well, let's see, we still have time before the wedding rehearsal, so we could schedule... Schedule? No way. You can't schedule fun. Hey, guys. The bakery's van just pulled up. Could I possibly draft you to take a look? Sure, yeah. Piece of cake. Oh, thank you! Very funny. Thank you. Exactly as the bride requested. Belgian cocoa, French cream, the finest Japanese marzipan, and I crafted the cake topper also, as requested, in pure Madagascar sugar, infused with orange blossoms and vanilla. Wow. Nice work. We aim to please. On time, and on budget, and the mayor's going to hear about this, right? Yes, of course. I'm a man of my word. Thank you so, so much. It's perfect. The bride is going to be so happy. Okay, we need to get this cake into that refrigerator. Yep. Yep, and just, just... Ooh, be so, so, so, so careful. It is a masterpiece. Yes... Watch the corner! Oh! Come on! Okay, okay... Oh, no, the sugar groom's arm fell off! Uh-oh. This is very bad. It's very bad. Very bad. Maybe Amber, she might not even notice that. Are you kidding? Amber would notice a flower petal out of place on a centerpiece 100 feet away. She sees bad omens in every mistake! What are we going to do? We can sub in a plastic one. Plastic? No, no, plastic's not going to work. So what do you suggest? What can we do? Nurse, a little more light, please. Oh, yeah, gladly. And thanks for bumping me up to nurse. Okay, frosting? Frosting, check. Okay. Now... Nope... Yes! Ooh. The ulna and the radius are going to make a full recovery. Wow. I'd say you've got a pretty steady hand in a crisis. I knew that surgical residency would pay off one day. Well, now that the crisis is averted, I think it's time for some of that fun that you promised. What did you have in mind? I was thinking maybe a little golf, not for networking, just for fun. Nice. Seriously? Nice! Why are you so quiet? Off my game a little bit, but I'm gracious in defeat, or pretending to be. We still have a little time before the rehearsal, and a golf cart at our disposal. What say we explore the resort a little bit? Explore? Yeah, there's probably some great picnic areas around here. You know what, I really should check on a few patients. What, you're not on call this week, are you? And they're in good hands? So they'll be fine. And you remember our deal, right? Fun when our work is done? You know what, you're right. I'm what? Does this thing have a stereo? Hope so. All right. Let's rock and roll! I wonder where Tess is. She's not answering any of my calls. What do you need her for, dear? Maybe I can help. No, I just wanted to check in. Amber? Dad? What is it? You arranged the orders for the rehearsal dinner? No, Jack did. Why? Well, there's been some confusion. The caterers are here now, and apparently, the vegan dinners are chicken. What? Jack was supposed to handle this! Maybe you can give him a call. I have been trying to text him for over an hour! There's no answer. Bernadette, have you seen Jack? I saw him with the other groomsmen back at the Commodore Club. I'm sure he'll be back soon. Unbelievable! Amber, Amber, big breaths. In... And out... Enjoying some of the wedding perks? Think I'm starting to get the hang of it. What do you think that cloud looks like right there? Oh, obviously, it's a kidney. No, obviously, it's a gavel. Everyone sees the world through their own filter. To cows, all they see is grass. That's true. To the cows, then. To the cows. Michael, I just want to say thank you. For what? For reminding me to enjoy myself while I'm here. You're welcome. Thank you, too. For what? Well, I've spent the last three years splitting people apart. It's nice to actually play a small role in bringing people together. So thanks for roping me in. That cloud now looks like a bunny. Oh, ooh, and that one looks like a heart. A heart! Oops, sorry. My fault! That is totally my fault. It is your fault. You know what? We should probably get to this rehearsal dinner. I told Mrs. Tilton I would set up the slideshow, and... Oh, my gosh, my phone is dead. My phone never dies! Hold on. What time do you have? What time? 5:20. We kind of lost track of time. Yeah, we're late! We're running late! We've got to go! Yes, we've got to go, right now. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Amber? Huh? Forget? No! No, I'm coming down the hall right now! Yep! Oh, I know. I am so, so sorry that I missed the rehearsal, but, no, I'm here. Yep, here I come. Hi. Oh! Oh, shoot. Okay... Hi! Where have you been? I am so sorry. I lost track of time. This rehearsal dinner, I mean, it's a disaster. Just take a deep breath. Okay. That's right. That's good. And relax. Now, go sit down. I'm going to get this fancy video out, going to entertain everybody. Jack's responsibility was the presentation! I can explain, but later. You go sit down, okay? Jack, why did you pass the presentation on to Tess? Honey, relax, okay? She's got it, and you've got dessert coming. It's going to be great. Um... I'd like to welcome you all here, and, uh, before we have dessert, I'd just like to say how grateful I am that we are all here to celebrate the happy couple, Amber and Jack. And I have a very special treat for you, courtesy of the wonderful technical assistance of our multi-talented maid of honor, Tess, some beautiful moments and tender memories from the happy couple's lives, for your viewing pleasure. Uh... Uh... Um... Tess? Just one second! Just a small technical glitch. Just a moment. Hurry. Come on. Ah! This tutorial will cover recent innovations in bunion treatment as well as... Why isn't it working? A bunion presents typically as a bony prominence from realignment of the joint at the base of the toes... This is wrong, this is wrong. No. Treatment of bunions may include rest, icing, and orthotics... I'll see if I can help her. More drastic measures include medication and surgery. I clicked the wrong file! What happened? Oh, my gosh. That's... That is disgusting. Oh. Oh... I clicked, I don't know! I'm trying to... There, does it work? I think it worked. Yeah. Amber... Just... Amber! It's not so bad, right? It's so bad. Somebody didn't notice. That was so bad. Everyone noticed. Amber, I am so sorry. This whole fiasco is all my fault. I should've planned more for my presentation. No, the presentation was Jack's responsibility, and the catering, and he failed at them both. Hey... So Tess did need help! I... Was busy. Doing what? Hanging out with your groomsmen? No... I mean, technically, yes, but... Look, Amber, I think you've got this all wrong. Jack has a really good reason for being away. Why does everybody keep making excuses for him? Amber! Amber! Hoo! Weddings, they really bring out the best in people. This is not good. The bride has melted down. She's been upset with me all week. Maybe I should just tell her the truth? That is not a good idea. Okay, but should I be taking advice from a divorce attorney? Funny. Jack, I'm your best man, and I'm your best friend. It's my advice. Honey, I am so sorry, but this will all be over tomorrow, in a good way! I just don't think I can go through with this wedding. Oh, Amber, it'll be okay. Just go inside. Relax. I will check in on you later, okay? Thanks, Tess. I took my eye off the ball. It's not so bad. It could have been a lot worse. Yeah, yeah. I could have clicked on the nose job presentation. And in my efforts to try and help everyone, I ended up ruining everything. I let down my friend, and you want to know the icing on the cake? I sabotaged any chance, any chance at that fellowship. Just a sec, the fellowship? Yeah! I didn't exactly wow Dr. Hastings with my organizational skills. Tess, I think this is all in your head. This has nothing to do with your qualifications. And you want to know the worst of it? I botched the wedding. Okay, look, it is wonderful how much you take care of everybody else, but I think... Thank you. And really, the silver lining in all of this is that you have just proven yourself to be a really great guy, and I... Dex? Surprise! Let me guess. The missing boyfriend? Uh, yeah, he's not supposed to be here. I think that's probably my cue to go. No, no, no. No. Stay, meet him. No, you guys have a good night. Hey, beautiful. Hi! What a surprise! Hey. Yeah. Didn't expect this. It's good to see you. Yeah. I don't understand. I didn't think you were coming. I know, but then I realized how important this was to you, and I wanted to surprise you. Well, mission accomplished. Tess, I've been thinking a lot about the last couple weeks, the fellowship at Northwestern, everything, really, and I started to see that I've been handling this all wrong. How so? I know how hard you've worked for this fellowship, and even getting this far is an accomplishment, and it wasn't fair of me to not support you in that. Especially since I didn't come to the table with a strong counter-offer. A counter-offer? I have a solution for this whole Chicago-Boston thing. What if I proposed? Proposed? Well, proposed to propose? What if I finally pulled the trigger on this? Um... Dex, are you trying to keep me from taking the fellowship by asking me to marry you? No! No, I... Not exactly. Because I didn't get it. Great! Great? No... I... Oh. Dex, look, I have a counter-proposal for you... That we just be friends. But we're such a great team. Teams support each other, but with us, it's always me supporting you, helping you re-do your office, or helping you get that all-important promotion, or just supporting you in work in general. Tess... Dex, you are not the bad guy here. I chose this, and I can choose something new. Is that what you truly want? It is. Okay. Hi. Hi. Finally got in a round of golf. Yeah, just hitting a couple balls. Michael, I really need to ask your help for something. Can you please tell me where the groom has been hiding himself? I don't know, Tess. I've been sworn to secrecy. See, Amber's actually thinking of not going through with the wedding, and she can't find the groom, yet again. This will be the last favor I do for the bride. Then I'm done. I did find out where your missing groom has been spending his time. You did? The Shangri-La room up in the clubhouse. Oh, thank goodness! Tess, can you go talk to him for me? Just find out what's been going on, straighten this all out? The rest is up to you. You have to go talk to him yourself. But you're my best friend. Exactly, and it's time for you to stand on your own two feet. Wait, where are you going? I am treating myself to a spa day. Maddy? Hi, stranger. How's it going, Tess? Let me guess. Putting out fires for the bride? Actually, you couldn't be farther from the truth. I am in a robe, headed to the spa for a visit. Robe? Spa? I must've called the wrong number. This is Tess Harper, right? I think so. Oh, Maddy, it's all just been so crazy. Dex showed up. Maddy, it's over. I did what I should have done a long time ago. Really? Are you okay? Actually... Yes. Then congratulations. I've got to run. Doc Williams needs me on an appendectomy. Thank you, Maddy. Bye for now. Bye. Your shoulders are like granite. You're carrying the weight of the world all yourself. I think maybe I've been trying to. But the world keeps spinning, with or without my problem-solving skills. Turn around, please. So, which do you want? The hot stone treatment, Shiatsu, or maybe a relaxation wrap? All of the above. Jack! What's going on? Amber, um... Okay, I... I don't know what the heck is going on here, but... It's a dance lesson, the last of 10, and time's a-wasting. A dance lesson? Can you just give us a second? This is what I've been doing. Bernadette was standing in for you to help me, to prep for the wedding dance. You know what a terrible dancer I am. I just... I wanted to surprise you. I am surprised. Oh! Ooh! That's the tango. Nice! I'm still working on it. Great minds think alike. Excuse me? An old trick I learned working the ER out of med school, grab rest when you can. Wise words. That's quite a presentation you made yesterday. Oh. Don't remind me. It was an honor to meet you, Dr. Hastings, and I really do hope that our paths will cross sometime in the distant future. Why do you say that? Are you withdrawing from the fellowship? Oh, no. No, no, no. I just... I just assumed, after yesterday, and that, um... Anyway, it was, it was an honor to meet you. Just tell me, for future reference, should I call you Tess, or Dr. Harper? Huh? Well, I meant what I said back at our golf game. What happens at this wedding has no bearing on the committee's decision, good or bad. Oh, and, um, your office will be down the hall from mine. Uh... I'm sorry. I don't understand. I don't think I'm... The board voted yesterday to accept you, but the decision was only made public today. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you any earlier, but when I saw you in action on the golf course, I knew we made the right decision. Yes! Oh, um, sorry. Oh, sorry. And what are you smiling about? I got the fellowship! Oh, Tessie! That's great! Does this mean you're going to stay in Chicago? Yeah! Yay! Yeah, Dex and I are through. Yeah, it just, it wasn't a match. No. How are you doing? Good. You know, everything's fixed. And you fixed it. See, you stood up for yourself. You didn't need my help. No, just a push. So, now that you're going to be in town, maybe there's a better match for you here? What are you getting at? No one knows you like I do, Tess, and from the first moment that Jack introduced me to Michael, I just, I knew that the two of you would hit it off. And then when Dex bailed on you, it just, you know, that was the final straw. Final straw for what? Well, you gave me a push. More like a shove. Yeah. Well, I gave you one, too. What are you talking about? Well, I thought I'd indulge in a little fiction to try and get you to spend some time with Michael. Wait, so... So what, this whole Bridezilla thing, it was all an act? Well, no, unfortunately, that part, that part was real, but the part where Michael picked you up at the airport, and the rest... I just remembered, the rental car is in Dex's name. Oh, don't worry. I'll arrange someone to pick you up. Oh, no, you don't have to do that, truly. Michael? Yeah? All set. Oh, Jack thanks you and I thank you. Do you mind picking up my friend Tess from the airport? Sure. Anything to get out of Wedding Central for a minute. Great. I'll text you the info. Okay. Amber? Hello? Are you there? I lost you. Yup. Still here. Think my WiFi is on the fritz. And technically, I don't have an Aunt Karen bringing me something blue. Sending you two on that scavenger hunt, that was just a ruse to try and get you to spend time together. Why, you sneaky... Hey. I know my best friend, and you do like a challenge, and Michael likes a woman who can think for herself. I can't believe you would do that to me. No, not 'to' you, Tess. 'For' you. I mean, there's no way I was going to let you choose Dex over the fellowship. He never treated you as a priority, and everybody knew that except for you. Well, things didn't exactly work out with Michael. But thank you for being worried about me. Now, I'm sorry, I think we have a wedding to get to. Oh. Oh, yeah, it's... Do you like my dress? Oh, yeah, you're ready. Let's go. Okay. No, you're good. I know you're allergic to weddings. You'll let me know if you start feeling faint? And you let me know if you feel any compulsion to fix any of the floral arrangements. Actually, your boutonniere is a little off. Let me just... Last thing I'll fix, I promise. Here goes. Be strong, and if you start seeing stars, it's just people throwing rice. Wow, you look like a man headed to the gallows. Any last words? We made a good team. We did. Friends and family, we are gathered here today to witness and to celebrate the union of Amber and Jack in marriage. I believe they've written their own vows. Amber, I vow to always love you and to make you happy, in championship seasons and in slumps, on sunny days, and really cold ones when I have to use a snowblower. I will always be there for you. Jack, a friend showed me this week what true caring means... To help someone when they need it, and to let them help themselves, too. I vow to love you and support you in every way. May we have the rings, please? Then, by the authority granted by the state of Illinois, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Finally. Welcome to the family. No more bills. Are you... Tearing up? Me? No, no. I think it's the, um... I think it's the flowers or something. I don't think it's the flowers. Maybe somebody has a cat. Definitely no cats at this wedding. Do you need a Kleenex? I'm okay. Okay. I'm so happy. Okay, right. It's got a nice ring to it. Hello, everybody. My name is Tess. I am the maid of honor. I am also the one responsible for that slide show yesterday. You're welcome. Amber and I have been best friends since kindergarten, and I just have to say what a great friend she has been. She absolutely deserves this amazing wedding. See? Weddings are about traditions and customs, some of which may seem crazy, some wonderful, but weddings are also about having fun. And I just want to thank a special someone for helping me realize we can enjoy both. And now, it's time for a wedding dance. It's not bad. I'd say so. Where's Dex? Headed back to Boston. I'm sure the two of you will be very happy together. Oh, I'm sure we'll be very happy, just not together, that's for sure. What? The thing is, I got that fellowship I wanted. Yeah. Wow! Congratulations! That's... So, Chicago, huh? That's... Yeah. See, the way I see it... Chicago has a lot of potential in a whole lot of ways. Don't worry. I know you're not a big fan of the wedding dance. Yeah, that was before. Before what? Before you. What was that thing that you said about the wedding dance? It's the first steps two people take in their life together, to music. Exactly. So... May I have this dance? This has been my favorite wedding, so far. Mine too. I think they're, uh... You're such a matchmaker. That's the only reason you had this wedding, isn't it?
