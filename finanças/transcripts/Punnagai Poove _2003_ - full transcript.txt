To my sister? My elder sister isn't married since last 18 years I'll conduct her marriage grandly with this money Bloody rascal! I'll beat you with slippers I said about my wife who's sister to you Why should I call your wife as my sister? Then, how will you address her? No one is accepting it When does your train leave tomorrow? Night at 9 Next day, marriage at Tirupati Father has strictly instructed me Hey, if it happens... Then, I'll commit suicide under your train only Don't get emotional There's only one day left If I miss Raju now I'll miss him all my life You both run away They're not criminals to run away Then, what should we do? They'll get married Right before their parents Hi everybody! Can you hear me? This is Kishore Good morning to youngsters and bad morning to old people Put down the newspapers Switch off your T.V's A hot news is awaiting you beside the swimming pool Nothing much Two people love each other We've arranged their marriage Sorry, as this marriage has been arranged suddenly I couldn't invite you all personally Consider this as a personal invitation and attend the marriage Get ready Going to announce Bride is...Sumathi of B-4 Bridegroom is Raju from the opposite flat Rascal! Are you getting a policeman's daughter married secretly? This is better than inviting everyone & marrying her to a man she dislikes Disperse respectfully or else I'll get you all arrested Threatening us? Have you forgotten law yourself? They both are majors according to the law You can't take any action Till now, she never defied him How can she defy if you scald her? If you utter one more word, you'll lose your honour I'll give you 5 more minutes Do you want them to get married before that? There are still 10 minutes to the auspicious time If I know she would do like this I would've aborted her before birth You say love is worse sin than aborting a child Good idea Hey, if he marries you, I'll die right now here Don't become emotional There're girls who committed suicide for not marrying their lovers No parents have ever died for their daughter marrying her lover Meera, why're you wasting your time talking to them? If they're interested let them stay back & watch the proceedings Or else ask them to leave the place Do parents mean so cheap to you? If any parent here accepts such a marriage? I will myself get you married How'll they say that? Everyone here considers the word 'Love' as a bad word Excuse me, they both love each other Why don't you adjust? Why do you want to bear the sin of separating two lovers? What do you say now? The 60 years old generation is very clear The 20 years old present generation is also clear People in the middle age have lost your mental balance and are struggling Why should I talk to you? Look, I'll get her married to someone else Mother! If he takes one more step forward I'll kill myself with this lamp Shit! Raju Excuse me Hi, a small doubt You've decided to marry against your parents wish If this is your decision, go ahead Else, if it was taken based on her support... Then, you people will be the losers Hey, don't shout It's natural that you'll get irked on hearing the truth Raj, this is your life But, for them it's just fun Once your marriage is over... They'll feel that they've achieved a herculean task...have beer & sleep You & Sumathi are going to start a new life tomorrow If you face any problem... No one will come to your help Only your parents will be with you I don't need anyone's help I can give Sumathi a comfortable happy life You know, I'm an Engineer earning Rs 25,000 every month I'm proud of you, Raj It was your parents who took care of you from your childhood & educated you What's this logic? You want their hard earned degree But not them, isn't it? You may come late night after roaming, watching movies with your friends You mother used to wait for you and serve you food at unearthly hours Today, your mother has also refused to bless you on your marriage At least now, couldn't you understand their feelings? When they don't want to understand our feelings, why should we care for them? It's fine for Raju because you're there to replace his mother But for you... No one can replace your mother's place till your death A mother can be a good friend But a friend can't be a mother Are you finished with your advises? It's getting late for the auspicious hour You useless, I'll pluck out your pony tail You don't know to chant the hymns properly, but asking us to hurry up Look Raj, our parents blessings is the most important thing in our marriage Why should you miss that? We don't say no But, they're not accepting us I'll talk to them What's wrong about Raj? A good job, a good salary, from a good family The boy is also handsome As they fell in love on their own you're not interested Why? Ego If you had seen Raj and fixed the alliance You would've praised him to the hilt, won't you? What was Raj's mistake? He did what every father would've done in their teenage You would've faced some problems then Now, you've become a problem to it It's very strange You start to oppose love once you become a father You want your son to go through the same pain which you had gone through Is it ragging? Find a better groom for Sumathi and better a bride for Raj And conduct their marriage But one thing If they both get married They'll live happily Else, lives of all the 4 will get ruined Enough Venkat Come... Assistant Commissioner sir Why should we still be egoistic? We must only perform our children's marriage Please go, sir If you unite lovers, both of them will be happy You said that if we separate, lives of all will get ruined Great!

I'll kill her Nithi, I told mother about Venkat She was shocked I want to talk to you about something I'll first talk to Venkat Let's talk later Even I wanted to talk to you regarding that Do you want me to forget Venkat? Are you mad? You'll understand the pain only if you love Liking and forgetting in the same breath isn't love Even if we don't meet each other We're always together You know that very well Even now, Venkat is here only He's keeping a watch on me, listening to my conversation Only lovers can feel those vibrations Nithi, you are clue less about love And Venkat! Are you asking me to forget him? Meera, be practical Who was the doctor who came to see you about marriage What did you reply when he expressed his love? I said I'm sorry - Why? - Because of Venkat If Venkat replies the same to you as you replied to the Doctor - He'll not say sorry - He'll What? Only you say that you love him He's very normal He's not at all craving for you According to him, you're a wrong number Why do you laugh? You see, under all circumstances, you used to think from my point Now you're going solo, I'm afraid Oh God! I'm afraid that I shouldn't miss you If he had loved you, he would've found out your phone number He wouldn't come in search of you Or else he would've expressed his love personally to you - Without any such thing happening... - It'll happen Okay, till then, you shouldn't phone him, or talk to him - Moreover if he himself comes in... - He'll come Only I'm there in his heart Let anyone approach him But, my voice resonates in him, will bring forth him to me Hey Nithya, I've forwarded your resume Get ready to fly Why is she walking without noticing me - Verify it correctly - Okay sir Then...as you enter the lobby...there's a way to the garden on the right, isn't it? - Venkat! - There's a swimming pool - Venkat, I want to talk to you - I'll finish this up & come I want to talk to you immediately Why're you dull, what happened?

She doesn't like love at all She's very possessive of you You're afraid that she might stop our marriage if she knows about our love What's all this? Shall I talk to her? Oh no! Hereafter you shouldn't see me, talk to me, or phone me - What's this madness? - Oh God!...It's not that Only when she's with me When is she without you? You always stick to each other like twins I'll myself come & see you, talk to you & phone you Nithi, do you need such a friendship between us? Discard her That's...That's not so easy Venkat She has sacrificed many things for me without her knowledge Now I answer she'll even sacrifice feedings for us Very good friendship Can I give you at least this? - What's 50% - Don't you know? Okay! Take your own time You'll find it out if you really love me Come on, tell me - I don't know - That means you don't love me Hey, why've you become so serious? It was just for fun Do you remember, It's the 50th day, when you had phone me up for the 1st time Do you know what's this?
