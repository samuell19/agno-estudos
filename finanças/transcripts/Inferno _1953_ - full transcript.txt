It's not like killing him, exactly. More just .. not saving him. It's killing him, alright. Look, we can still change. Can still send the helicopter back for him. Just say we got on the wrong road in the dark last night and went in a ditch. That's all. He'll be sore at the delay but he'll never know. Nobody will. Yes I .. I suppose we could. Hey they've covered some ground. Yeah. Hello Mrs Carson, Mr Duncan. Looks like you folks had a pretty good ride. Too good, for my taste. Did you get car trouble or did Mr Carson decide he's not the cowboy type? Uh .. Mr Carson had to leave rather hurriedly. On business, something he'd forgotten about. You haven't heard from him? - No ma'am. Oh, well. I suppose he'll send his trailer back. Or he'll have someone contact you about it. Or something. Mrs Carson, it will be alright. There isn't a plane service to L.A. is there? Yeah, sort of. From Whitick. You only got about a half-hour, though. There wouldn't be time to change. Well .. alright. Ken, help Mrs Carson get her things from the cabin, will you. They're bound to use planes in the search. Dave will insist on it. You sure they won't see that blanket we left? No, Gerry. Look. You see .. Wait a minute. Here is the El Corne range where we were yesterday. Here's where the horse threw him up in here. And we rode back down to the car and trailer about there, and .. That's where .. Well, then we .. Drove out on that little trail this way. That's 20 miles already. Now, the road that runs along up through here. Over into here. Clear on the other side of the pink mountain. That's where we made the false camp last night. Where I ditched the car and where the search will be. But Don is .. Clear over here 80 miles away up in that canyon. Where are they? "They ought to be here by now." "No cure for a broken leg." "Not enough of it, either." "If it would only stop hurting for one minute." "I'm just lucky they left me plenty of water." "If they're going to stall round all day." "Maybe Gerry couldn't charter a helicopter right away." "I told her to buy one if she could." "I wish I hadn't sent her now." "It didn't speed things up any." "A fine time to be low on cigarettes." "I guess I'll hear it before I see it." "I'm glad I thought of a helicopter." "I sure would hate to have to walk out of here." "Even on two good legs." Good afternoon, madam. Is Mr Carson back yet, Mason? No, Mrs Carson. - Oh? Why don't you come in a minute? I'll see if I can get Dave Emory. He might be still at the office. - Wait for me, will you please. Would you bring my things in, Mason. - Yes, Mrs Carson. We can call right in here. "Mrs Carson is on line two Mr Emory." Good. Just a second. Will you bring me the folders on Sterling Oil and Harley Steam. They're probably on Mr Carson's desk. The bottleneck? Hello. Gerry? Yes, Dave. Say Dave, have you heard anything from Don? Why no. I thought you two were still out in the desert .. With Duncan on that manganese thing. Well we were, but Don got to drinking .. And you know: the vanishing act. In Joe's car, too. Well, he couldn't have picked a worse time. We're already held up on a couple of things waiting for his signature. When did this happen? Last night, in the middle of the desert. A million miles from nowhere. We had to ride the horses in .. I'm dead. "Yes, I should think you would be." I .. I suppose he'll be alright. Don't you? Oh, of course. He always has been. Then again, maybe in the desert .. Why did he have to go to the desert to play businessman anyhow? Well, we should get the police out there I guess, to keep an eye out for the car. It can't hurt anything. No publicity of course. Where was this? Well, do you know where Whitick is? Oh. Just a minute, Dave. Joe Duncan is still here. He can tell you better than I. Joe. Joe would you tell Dave where we were. Sure. Hello Dave, how are you? Oh, we were a little surprised. Well, you turn north off the highway about five miles this side of Whitick. Maybe a little more. Uhuh. Oh, I see. The other way? Yeah, yeah. Well. I'll call the Sheriff I think, and he can .. Huh? Why yes. Yes, surely. License number? Yes. That's 1-U-1. 1-U-1-9-2-8-5. Fine. Sure, I'll let you know. Goodbye. Thanks. There it is. Made to order. All of it. Yes. I know. I keep thinking there must be something. There isn't. It couldn't possibly be more perfect than we planned it. Joe, you're sure the blanket will get too dirty to see? Yes, once it rains. Look. When it does, I'll rent a plane and fly over there and make certain. I don't want to go back and .. Bury everything for a long time. Until this has all died down. Not if I don't have to. Oh, that would be .. When will we have to go back to Whitick? When the Police get a report on the car and call Dave. Maybe tomorrow. We don't even have to sell our end of the story. Dave's already doing that. The tracks we left will back him up. It all fits. Especially with Don having pulled this kind of a thing before. This is where you camped, isn't it? - Yes. It's so tremendous. Can you really tell if a man's out there or not, for certain? Sure can, if you got a place to start. We got a saying out here. Nothing can cross the desert without leaving tracks but a bird. Flying. Morning folks. - Lieutenant. Hello Mrs Carson. This is deputy Parks. Mr Emory .. Mr Duncan. - Glad to know you. We found where Mr Carson crossed the centre of the road. About 100 yards up past the car. Oh? That's all so far. Of course, traffic has destroyed the prints and wheel tracks. But we'll pick up more if he walked very far. Now, you see. There's a man's prints out to the road and back. Made after the car left. So, those will be Mr Duncan's. And there's yours in the other track. Walked out to the road to take a look, I reckon. Right after Mr Carson drove off, maybe? Why yes, that's right. Now. Here's the one of Mr Carson. Three's his and Mr Duncan's together. Notice how they're different. All the men have seen these. So they'll recognize Mr Carson's wherever they come on them. I had no idea you could tell so much. I could track a fellow with stuff like this myself. But the things a real tracker can catch .. Even rocks, you know. Maybe just a tiny pebble turned over. See? See how it's different underneath? - Amazing. Mike there, tracked a fellow straight across lava rock one time. Fourteen miles. What are they doing now? Well, Michael there will make a complete circle around. Tell me, how can a man get drunk enough .. To go off and leave a thing like that? If he doesn't find anything, he'll probably make a bigger circle. Maybe two. Same thing up where Mr Carson went into the ditch of course. Now the fellows on horseback like these. They'll check all the roads for twenty miles around. Both sides. And if Mr Carson left the road anywhere at all, you can be sure they'll see him. Hi Sheriff. - Hi Sam. Come on, get along. Sam Elby. Real old-time prospector. Hank must have caught him in town this morning and persuaded him to help. We use extra men on something like this of course. Notice how they didn't move again until they looked back down. Be sure, they don't miss an inch. Say Lieutenant, there was a man coming out from the garage. He's there now. - Did he say anything? It will take about three days. They really stripped it Mr Duncan. Doors, wheels, radio. A lonely road like that, they just took their time and picked it clean. You can hardly tell it was a station-wagon anymore. Is that plane watching for him, too? Well, he .. Watches for a fire at night. A man is out there, you know. He hears a plane, tries to signal, builds a fire. You can see a fire a long way at night you know. Right now though, he's looking for .. Well, for birds mostly. Birds? - Yeah, buzzards. If something gets down you, know. A lot of times they'll locate .. Of course, this time of the year they are mostly all gone. "Five-X calling Jeep-7." Jeep-7, Five-X, go ahead. "Found a whiskey bottle up here." "Just off the road from where those tracks crossed the center." "Same brand." Anything else? Any sign? "Nope. Want the bottle?" Just bring it in when you come. "Five-X out." Jeep-7 out. Well, if he's out there, they'll find him. It's good to know. I'd hate to think of anybody alone and helpless in this country. It's good to know if they don't find him we can be sure he's not in the desert. Anywhere. "So they think that's all there is to it." "Just leave me and I'm dead." "They'll see." "I'll get out of here." "And when I do, they'll be the sorriest pair that ever lived." "What have I got?" "I just have to organize things, that's all." "Not too much food." "Well, might start a fire with it." "A fire is not a bad idea." "A plane might see a fire from a long way." "Not in here though. It would have to be right over me." "Got to get out in the open." "I'll never make it the way they rode out." "Could I find a way down to the bottom somewhere?" "Then go out along the bed." "A long way. And I'd have to have a rope." "Or wings." "How much water have I got?" "Not much. Maybe a gallon." "It doesn't matter. I'll make it last." "I can do it." "Just because I've never had to do anything like this, don't mean I can't." "I'll show them. Just have to plan." "Use my head." "I can't do anything unless I can fix that." "This won't be jolly." "But I've got it to do." "They'll see." "They'll see." "I need a pad." "Some kind of splint." "Get it straight first." "What do they do?" "Auto-hypnosis?" "Pretend it's not my leg." "Just a leg with no feeling." "Like a plaster leg." "It doesn't have anything to do with me." Goodbye, Sheriff. - So long. By the way, Sheriff. I meant to ask you. Is there any .. ow! What's it like in the summertime around here anyway? Well, a lot like this to tell the truth. Don't usually have it so hot this late though. Oh I .. I was wondering was there any game around here? Some. Plenty of quail. Doves. You heard what he said about how far you can see a fire at night. Maybe he could crawl out to .. - Oh, he couldn't crawl it in a month. It took us four hours on horseback. He'll try it. He doesn't know any better. He won't get anywhere. He'll quit. "For somebody else's leg." "It sure hurts." "But it looks straight." "Just have to keep it straight, that's all." "It can't hurt for ever." "Probably." "Looks kinda spontaneous." "But it will have to do." "I just hope it's long enough and doesn't break." "A pint a day .. will never drown me." "I guess I'm on my way." "To somewhere." "And not there." "Not much choice." "Just take me longer to forget them." "Unless I stumble on a drugstore on the way down." "Thirty feet." "In another thirty they'll be bleeding." "And I had such big ideas." We're pretty sure he's not out there, Mrs Carson. Tomorrow when we finish, we'll go back over everything again. Having each man check something different, so we'll know. A couple of things I wanted to ask you. Probably pointless, but the only way to .. Be sure not to miss something important is to ask you everything I can think of. So. Mr Duncan, where you headed when you stopped and made camp that night? To tell you the truth Lieutenant, I was just about 65 percent lost. You see we were headed for a spot that was quite a horseback ride. And Mr Carson is not the 'outdoor type' you know. Besides that he was .. - He'd already started drinking. Excuse me. Anyhow, he didn't like the idea of the ride. So I thought maybe I could come around .. And get in other side of the range and make it a shorter ride. The trouble was I got further away instead of closer and finally .. Well .. I thought I knew this country pretty well, but .. So, you never got there at all? - No. Just where were you headed, Mr Duncan? Oh uh .. over there, into the mountains. See Lieutenant, it is a mining project. A big deposit of low-grade ore and just to uh .. Get in there, do the surveying, prove claims. There are so many. It would take a lot of money. Until I can get Mr Carson, or somebody to finance me, why .. My only protection is that nobody knows where it is. Of course if .. - No. No, it's alright. I'd rather not know. Not now anyway. If I don't I can't let anything slip. You know, he carried a lot of cash on him like you say. I'm just worried he might have got picked up by the wrong man. There's folks out here kinda careless about robbing and killing. Yes, I've been thinking about that. He just walks out when he does this? No warning? In the middle of poker hand one time. Gone three days. He had the winning hand too. No idea where he goes, huh? No place you could check? Don't reckon it could be another woman? Pretty unlikely. They been married long? Any children? No. Five or six years. Get along pretty well? Sheriff, he doesn't get along too well with anybody. You don't think she married him for his money? Hmm. No. She might leave him if he didn't have it. She hasn't any of her own. I enjoyed the beer. Thanks for being so patient. - Not at all, Lieutenant. Goodnight. - Goodnight. He suspects something, doesn't he? Nothing special. Just checking. Just a good cop, that's all. We don't have to worry as long as they stay away from the El Corne mountains. But when they realize he's not .. Not coming back, won't they check even further? What if they find someone who saw us go out that way? They may, but they won't get there for some time yet. Just hope that it rains first. Once it rains we'll be alright. The tracks will be gone. He's talked with David and the Sheriff. - I know. I don't think old button-eyes misses anything either. They're talking about us, aren't they? - Probably. They'll dig into our past too when Don doesn't show. Try to find something between us but they won't get anyplace .. Because there wasn't anything until .. Just three nights ago. Seems like years. Well, I'm his lawyer and I suppose you would call me his business manager too. His fortune is inherited, you know. Mostly investments just now. He doesn't do much of anything really. Though he likes to think he does. How do you mean when you say he's hard to get along with? Always unpredictable. Impatient, unreasonable and sometimes rather vengeful. He avoids even personal relationships where money doesn't give him an edge. And he can be pretty rough with them. Doesn't sound like a very popular fellow at that. Not a very happy one either. No. He's not. You see, I feel he's always had the fear that without his money he'd be nothing. Helpless. Of course, maybe he would be. "I wonder what they're doing now." "Probably somewhere laughing at me." "If I hadn't made it so easy for them." "Even when Dave does decide I'm not going to turn up." "They'll have them looking for me in the wrong place." "Nope, not a chance." "I might manage that one .. with a rope." "Well, that will work." "Maybe." "Pretty dry." "Something to chew." "Pebbles." "Did I read that somewhere?" "It tastes like I made it up." "By the time I get out of here, I can qualify as a first-class .." "Camp-fire girl." "If this doesn't break I'm sure going to write a testimonial for nylon." "Hello bird." "Hello lunch." "Be patient now." "You dainty, feathered snack." "This sort of thing takes a little .." "Time." "Goodbye lunch." "I'll never hit anything if that's a sample." If you hear a rapping tapping at your cabin door tonight. Late tonight. Don't shoot, don't scream. I will only be .. Joe, you're insane? No, baby. Not insane exactly. Just .. Well, you sound as if you were. You know you said we couldn't take any chances. I know, I know. But that was yesterday and there are .. Circumstances which make that seem a long time ago. Can make four days reach back into the distant past. Maybe you don't have the same sensation? Of course, you fool. Was your call anything? The office. If we don't hear from Don by tomorrow I'm filing a missing-persons report. I don't care how mad it makes him. If it will make him mad enough to get in touch with us then I'll be satisfied. Well, I think I'll dress. Oh, that call. I have to go to Houston tomorrow. I'm sorry. I won't be able to ride back with you. See you at dinner. Probably be a hot trip anyhow. "I've got to get it some way." "I might have climbed that once." "I wish I'd kept in shape." "No telling how far around I'd have to climb to get back up to it." "It could take a day." "Maybe more." "I can't cut off enough to do any good." "I don't know what to do." "Without it, for spots like this I can't get anywhere at all." "Okay." "If I have to climb back up I climb back up." "That's all." "They probably thought I'd eat all my food right away." "And drink all my water." "Sit there and die." "They probably think I'm dead already." "They sure had a nice set-up." "Pretty near perfect." "Just one little flaw." "They picked the wrong guy." Pardon me, ma'am. You're going to have a problem with the papers you know. Both of you. Are you going to talk to reporters? Oh dear, I hadn't thought. Do you think I should? Not if you don't want to. If a paper wants to make a sensation, talking to its reporters won't help any. Oh sure. They'll just say: 'Mrs Carson denies romance with mining man'. That's right. You simply have the servants tell everybody you're too upset to talk. And refer them to me. - Oh Dave, could I? Of course. I really am upset, I think. I'd so much appreciate it. Of course, I'll see you in a couple of days. Bye, Sheriff. Bye, Lieutenant. Bye, Dave. - So long Mr Emory. If anything has happened to Mr Carson, ma'am. I know it won't seem much consolation .. But even so .. you can be thankful to know that he's not in the desert. Fred is right. I doubt if much could help your man that wouldn't be quicker and nice than that. Well, then .. I am glad. Is it really so dreadful? Yes. Well, I didn't realize. "That shouldn't get stuck." I wish they hadn't said anything. Just don't think about it, baby. Anyhow, he didn't suffer any longer than he wanted to. He was bound to know it was hopeless pretty quick and he had the pistol. Yes. That's true, isn't it. Do you think he is already ..? That it's over? - Sure. Shall I light one for you? - Hmm. Only thing that bothers me is I'd better not see you again until after it rains. And that could be quite a while. Oh well. We got a long trip ahead of us. Probably, we'll make very poor time, too. "Oh. Murder." "That leg." "Like it's broken again in six places." "All over." "Looks alright though, I guess." "Swallowed my pebbles." "Probably not much nourishment in them." "Oh, I was afraid." "For a minute I was afraid that .." "That I had lost some." "Maybe about a pint." "That's a day." "A day gone." "And a day's water." "Lost two days in one." "That's great." "With enough of this a man could get .." "Discouraged." "Emory is certain that Carson would not plan his own disappearance .." "With the intention of making it permanent." "Without arranging to take most of his fortune with him." "However, Carson has been missing a week." "The police feel that the passing of each day increases the chance .." "That he is no longer alive." "And now the weather forecast." "The mild spell in all western states will continue." "There is no sign of rain anywhere this side of The Rockies." "So you can leave your umbrellas home for a while." "I guess I might as well have stayed there and waited for it." "Like they thought I would." "How long does it take to die of thirst?" "I must be pretty close." "Tongue is getting thick." "I could go on a little maybe. But what's the use?" "Of course, if that cactus is full of beer." "Well, it grew there." "It's full of something." "Horsehair and feathers probably." "But I can find out." "I haven't really got much else to do." "I got to .." "Pound it down so that I can get to it." "Soft." "I can cut it." "It doesn't look very wet, but maybe .." "It is!" "How about that?" "It doesn't taste bad either." "Sort-of, like chewing wet sawdust." "If I could eat it." "And it had about ten times as much juice." "I'd be in business." "I guess it's better than nothing." "I wonder if it's poisonous." "I'm sure in a good position to find out." "This stuff is a great discovery." "I'll just sit there and work on it all day." "If I can get enough juice to .." "Sit there and work on it all day." Hey! Hey, anybody there? "No." "It's too old." "I might make a crutch, from one of those timbers." "Later on." "As long as there is so many." "I might as well get comfortable." "It sure is a lot of work." "For so little juice." "Maybe if I get really full of this stuff." "I'll get some strength back." "And then I can .." "Now then." "Just come a little closer." "No hurry." "I've got nothing but time." "No, not there." "That's it." "Now just sit still somewhere." "Come on out." "Come on." "That's it." "Perfect." Stop! Stop that! Put it down! That's my rabbit. Stop that. Stop that I say. Come back here. That's my rabbit. "It's no use." "I'll never get out of here." "Cactus won't keep you alive." "It just lets you die a little slower." Thank you, Mason. No. No thank you, Mason. You're not eating anything. I'm not very hungry. You're feeling very low about this, aren't you. I just have a feeling that things would have been different. If he hadn't grown up with so much money in a world where it has such power. He might have been quite a guy. It seems a shame that he did not have a chance to find out .. Whether he was or not. "I never had a chance." "I was just kidding myself." "Because I wanted to get out." "And get my hands on them." "When I think of getting away with it." "It makes me .." "If there was some way I could stop them from .." "Wait a minute." "Somebody came in for that mine." "Somebody will come again." "Someday." "If they find my .." "Bones." "I could write a note." "If I got a pencil." "Dear Finder." "These are the bones of Donald Whitley Carson the 3rd." "His wife Geraldine." "And Joseph Duncan." "Murdered him." "I want to fix something to call attention in some way." "A pile of rocks maybe." "So the remains will .." "Remain." "I have to get out of here." "In the spring." "When the snow melts up above, it will wash everything away." "This will be a waterfall." "And a big pool." "It will make a lot of roar .." "And splash." "And mist." "Mist." "Mist floating all around." "In the spring." "Must remember." "Always visit the desert in the spring." "Then it is .." "It is." "This is a pool." "A big basin." "It's in rock." "It doesn't leak." "And the sand is blowing after." "Why is it that? It's barely possible." "If it would .." "Only stop falling back in." "I smell it. I smell it." "Isn't that fantastic." "Herds of animals, but .." "I never thought a person." "There it is. It's there." "Something to soak it up with." "Supposed to go slow. At first anyhow." "I'm going to live." Got him! "It sure was a short deer." "Bartender. Draw me a short deer." "Some joke." "What the ..?" "Now it rains." "All this time, and now it rains." "Better get this stuff under cover." "I don't want the meat to get wet." "And the matches? Brother, not the matches." "It wouldn't rain when I was dying of thirst." "Okay rain. Go ahead." We're really safe now. They'll still question us and want us to take them back over our route probably. It doesn't matter. Our tracks are gone. They'll want you to take them to the manganese too. I'll take them to some. Sixty miles from there. It's no good but there's nothing they can do about it. So I'm a lousy prospector. All we have to do now is sit tight and let nature take its course. And uh, personally .. "Not enough smoke to see very far. Too windy." "Well, wait until night and build some fires." "Three in a row. Three means help. Everybody knows that." "Build these up different times each night." "Some airline pilot will see them sooner or later. Bound to." "Feels good." "I have to decide what I'm going to do to my dear wife and her .." "I could just shoot them if want to." "No jury would convict me." "What I'd like to do." "If I could get them out here some way." "Leave them." "Like they did me." "No food, water." "Anything." "I might as well keep going straight ahead." "The further out I get the more chance of a plane seeing the fires." "I wonder what's out there." "Yeah." "Yes, I do hear it." "There it is." "Coming this way." I did it. I did it. Come on. Come on, pal. Here I am! "Got to signal." "Smoke." "He'll see me from this close, even if the wind is strong." "This way, back here." "That's it." Now what? That's my canyon. Duncan. Nobody else would .. "Did he see me?" "Maybe not. He's going on." "He couldn't land in this stuff." "He'll be back tomorrow if he saw me. That's certain." "I sure wish I had some ammunition." No, I am not certain. How can I be? But he's not where we left him .. And there's a waterhole at the bottom of that canyon. Somebody made that smoke. But you said it was impossible. How could he? How should I know? What does it matter if he did it? What we've got to do is .. Get to him before somebody else does. You mean .. Just kill him? What else? But, just to murder him in cold blood? I mean, it's different from simply .. Not saving him. You mean it is wrong to shoot him, but it was alright to .. Leave him to suffer. To die from thirst. Oh alright. I know. "No use going very far." "If he saw me he can pick up my trail." "He'll find me." "He'll come from that way." "Might as well get on a high spot where I can watch for him." "Don't know what good it will do." "Can't run." "Can't shoot." "I'm really a sitting duck." "Went to sleep." "I wish I knew whether he saw me." "Maybe he's out there somewhere now." "You know. With a rifle and some ammunition." "I bet I could live a long time out here." "Hey." "It's a car .. he did see me." "No." "No, it couldn't be Duncan." "Not from there." "Got to signal." "Duncan might see it if he's anywhere near. I have to risk that." "Anyhow, this guy will get here first." "If he's coming at all. If he sees my smoke." This way! Up here! Look this way! Just once. Just one time, pal. That's all. Just one time. "What's the use?" "He's gone." "Well, there's a road over there, anyway." "I guess I can walk to it." "Somebody will come along." "It doesn't look very far." "At least .." "Duncan didn't come back and .." "Pot me like a lame duck." "I've got that to be thankful for." "Distance sure fools you out here." "I have to be careful. A man can get hurt this way." "Break a leg." Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Here! Over here! Want a ride? I sure do. Blowing out smoke. Come in with me. I'm nearly out of gas. Nice splint. Thanks. The doctor will probably break it two or three times more when I take it in. But it doesn't hurt. My name's Elby. Sam Elby. Mine is Carson. I figured it might be. Come on. We've got to get out of here. I was turning around to be ready and I .. I hit a rock. I thought I'd better let you get it off. You've split the crankcase open. Will it run? Baby, this is bad. I too late. That old prospector Elby got to him first. I could have killed them both. But he had a rifle. There was no telling who .. You saw what happened. - No. You were running out on me. - No, Joe. I was only turning around. I told you. I wouldn't do a thing like that. It's sort-of a pity too. Because you didn't have to. Nobody knows we came out here, that we know he's alive. With the car we could have gotten away. Easy. Now. I don't think we stand a chance. If that's what you believe, walking is not worth it. Skip it. Where are we going? I'm heading for Mexico myself. Yes, I suppose that's best. Wait for me, Joe. You're going so fast. I could have took you into town tonight only I ain't got very good lights. In fact, any. It's alright. No hurry. I know I'll get there now. Joe! Please wait for me. Please wait, Joe. Please. Joe. You know. Many a fellow .. Wouldn't have made out very long in your place. Desert fellows too. A man's got to understand the desert. You can't fight her. She'll lick you every time. You gotta .. got to go along with her. But you can count on her if you do. She got everything a man needs. If he knows how to get it. If he don't, it's his fault. Not hers. "I came a long way at that." "Not in a taxi, either." Oh uh .. Here's some money. Do you want some? Go on, take some. Plenty of it. Well. Say what? So, you got more than you need. It's handy if you happen to get to town. That's right. Well I .. I reckon I could get up and wash the dishes if I had a kettle of water. And if it was hot. If I felt more like it. I beg your pardon? What did you say? - Hmm? Nothing. Never mind. I was thinking about what you're going to do to .. them folks? Funny. I probably wouldn't have even gotten out of there. Except for thinking what I was going to do to them. But now somehow they .. Seem kind-of unimportant. I do too. A man can't spend much time out here. Alone. Feel important? Good, yes, but uh .. Not important. What is it? You need any help? I say, do you need any help? [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] Where's Duncan? What a way to die.
