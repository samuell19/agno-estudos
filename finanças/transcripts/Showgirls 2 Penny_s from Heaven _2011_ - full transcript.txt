- Be careful what you wish for. Dreams really do come true. - As the saying goes, the one who fools the world for being dumb is the one we should all be afraid of. - So where you goin'? - Hollywood. - Hollywood, huh? Well I can get you as far as Barstow. Alright. Hollywood, huh? Wow, you gonna bet the farm on it? Good luck. Well my name's Jeffrey, you can call me Jeff. So, you gonna be an actress or something? - I'm gonna be a star. - A star? Fucker? I mean what else is there to do in Hollywood except fuck stars, right? - It's better to be a star fucker than a not a star fucker, right? - You a stripper? - I'm a dancer! - Whoa, hohohoho, whoa, whoa, what are you crazy? Whoa, whoa, whoa, look, look. I give you a ride in my uncle's million dollar Porsche and you pull a gun on me? What is this? I mean I'm not some piece of cattle you can just prod around. I'm gonna pull over, you can get out alright? You get out, crazy bitch. Come on, get out. - Okay, I'm sorry. It shoots blanks, but next time, I'll blow the wad in your ass, got it? - I'll make you a bet. We can play a game of strip poker, you win, I give you a ride. You lose, you're stuck in Pearl Blossom. - Are you serious? - You got a man? Lemme guess, he's a star, right? - No, he's not famous. - Cause I could, I could give a crap about all that. Guess I'm just not a star fucker. - Mmmm, well. Well, I met this Hollywood producer, and I have an audition, to be a movie star. - Really? - But what I really want to do is be on that dance show, Star Dancer. - Star Dancer? Oh yeah, my uncle's got something to do with that show. It's up at the Seven Sisters. Creepy place. One time I got, went up there and got in a lot of trouble. Look, I gotta pull over alright, and get some gas. You do coke? Stuffs got diamonds in it. It's the best stuff I could find in Vegas. - I'll try some. - It's strip poker time. I'm gonna kick your ass. - Oh, my suitcase. - Well just leave it. Don't you trust me? Oh, shit. I forgot my wallet. Hey, go on in the barn, I'll meet you there in just a second. - Where'd you go? Fuck! Fuck! - If you would've paid me my fair share for that gig, I wouldn't have to be whoring myself out for pennies. - I paid you what you deserved, tramp. I'm the captain, and you're Elvis. That was in the contract, 50-50 split right down the middle. - Oh, I got your middle right here. - We're gonna catch traffic on the way Hollywood, then we're all screwed. Oh, I know, Sammy! Where is Sammy? - Oh, isn't that called lolly gagging? - Part of my act, the dumb blonde. As the saying goes, the one who's able to fool the world for being dumb, is the one we should all watch out for. I know that saying. - You know what? Just forget about it. I'm not going. We're gonna stay in Vegas, we'll do the show at the Pink Flamingo tonight. Fuck it. - Oh, if I work on two dead presidents, - Well, can I come? - Sorry, no room. Hey where you goin'? Hollywood. Hey, jump in back. Hmmph, you're hopeless, and I know it was you that stole my Versace! - There's hope, right? - That's where you belong. In the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant. You look sexy that way. - I look sexy when I'm dancing with you. I hope your T-shirt business can start making some money, and then I don't have to go strip. * Work it like a stripper on a pole * suck my dick? That's my job. Suckin' dick, or dancing? Dancing, Jimmy, dancing. - You're worth it, Mr. Neubagrosa. Bitch! You stole my customer! You stole my g-string! Man, that bitch must be on the rag. - Yeah, she's still pissed at me. Thinks I ripped her off. Watch your ass, dude. Hey, can I borrow your cell phone? Bye, Jimmy, goodbye forever. I got talent. Well I hope your thumb us as stiff as those dicks at your job, 'cause you're gonna be hitchhiking now, and I'm not paying for a taxi! - Shut up! I'm a dancer, not a whore. - Oh, yeah, bitch? You gotta take dance classes. It's ballet technique. You gotta have that if you wanna be a dancer. And you don't have money for that. - I'm done. I'm done with him. D-U-N, done. - You dumb bitch! Too bad you had to look. Where are you, you bitch? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? - Hey, what happened? You all right? What happened, you blow out a tire? Something I can help you with? - No. - Wait a second, I know you! You gave me, you gave me my birthday dance at Cheeta's. God, what was that, 1995? Do you remember? How the hell are you? - Fucker, fuck off! I have a can of mace! - Fix your own damn car. Have a nice life. - I need a disguise. - Live from the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, breaking news. There have been three people found brutally murdered in the desert near the California Nevada border. They appear to be celebrity impersonators, there was even a Marilyn, identified by the signature beauty mark, her dress-- Goodbye, goodbye forever. I got talent. - Okay, I never said a bitch ain't got no talent. But the world's hard out there man, everybody got AIDS and shit. H1N1, all kinds of shit. Ain't no happy ending, man, when you're chasing that dream. Ain't no pot of gold at the end of that stupid ass rainbow. - Stop. Your I.D., ma'am. Copy. Vegas. Got any weapons on you? - No. - Okay. Enjoy yourself here in the Seven Sisters. We don't want no trouble. No whores, and no snails. You read me? We run a tight ship. * Insane girl * We know her story * A beautiful girl * Out in the big bad world * She's on the road * To making history * But at the darkest hour * Is when you finally see the light * You'll find your way to make it there * It's your story Yeah, yeah. Damn, Whoo! - Get drunk! Get drunk! - Another round, for the house, on me. Yeah! - Damn! Yeah! - Beer pong? - I'm Godhardt. Where are you from? - Other states. - No, really. What's your name? - I can't remember, Olga, Helga! Helga. - Helga? It's good to meet you, Helga. I would like to take you to a nice dinner, someplace magical. So Helga? - Helga? - Well that's your name, isn't it? - Mmhmm. - What brings you to this part of Seven Sisters? - Dance. But I'll be leaving to go to different places. Gotta learn ballet first. - Learn ballet? I think you might be too old. How old are you? 30? 32? 35? - 32 sounds good. I never got my formal technique training. I gotta take classes from Alvin Ailey or Julliard or Geoffrey and, I've got the money to do it. - I hate to burst your bubble. Have you won any international competitions? - I won Miss Budweiser. Miss Budweiser is international. - A wet titty contest. I studied music at Julliard. - No shit? - Look it's, it's tough out there. Major conservatories aren't gonna give a shit about tits and ass, or pouring beer on your tits. - Well ballet is respectful. Maybe I'll end up in the Nutcracker dancing one of parts of the nuts or pastry things. I just want to strut my stuff. - You want it? - Bad. - How bad? - I'm a showgirl, and I was born to be the star of the show, but there can only be one Star Dancer. What do you do? Play in a band? - The violin. Almost my profession, now just a hobby. The instrument makes beautiful noise but no money. Oh, I just needed that lucky break. - Well we have a lot in common 'cause, I need that lucky break too. - I'm working on a deal, to open my own musical cabaret on the north end of Seven Sisters. A high class joint. Big stars, big time shit. I'm gonna call it Godhardt's Goddess Club. Be my star dancer. Okay. So how old are you? - 27, but I like older women. Women are like bananas, they're the sweetest when they're ripe, right before they shrivel. But you, you are a banana split, with a cherry on top, and nuts. - I'm freaked out, let's go back. - We can't, they locked us in. Trust me, when you get to the end you are gonna so happy. Keep going, it's then end of the rainbow, Helga. This is Madame Blavatsky's mystic masonic rope symbol. - Oh, yeah, from the opera. I've never been, but I knew a madam at the Bunny Ranch. - What the-- No, not Madame Butterfly, Madame Blavatsky. She wrote The Secret Doctrine, occult philosophy, said to be influenced by the Voltaire. - Oh, I never heard of her, or vulture? - Shhhhhh. She believed in magic, enlightenment. She had many followers and philosophies. Madame Blavatsky pointed out the Pagan symbol of the letter g symbolized God, but the lunatic took the symbol upon himself, and called it the swastika. She's not gonna be here, is she? Well, she died in the 1800s. - Caesar. - Your Majesty. A gem, Sir Brandt, maybe your finest yet. Your table is right this way. Place your bid for a night with this golden goddess. - Kara, the Ultra Vixen is here? I'm her biggest fan. Why is she here? - They're all whores. We will dare to prepare for - Hey she took my shoe. - Oh no! Oh! - Oh God. Are you trying to get me 86'd here? - I just wanted her autograph. I was concerned fan! - Oh, Helga, you have, you have to stop being so nice. Listen to me, you have to stop acting like you just fell off the turnip truck. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means, I just think you might be a little bit dumb. But that's what I like about you. Come on, look at, look at you, a turnip in your hair. Would you like to go to a party with me on Saturday? Very fancy, a gala at the castle. You mean, you're not mad at me, 'cause I got thrown in the trash tonight? No, of course not. - Yes, I would love to. You mean you really wanna see me again? - I think maybe, maybe, there's a chance of us having a future together. Look, see, a bed fit for a princess. * And I'm closer to heaven now * You're the reason why * I'm under the influence of love * Don't you know * That I'm under the influence of love * Feel in love * Feel in touch * Feel the influence of love * Feel in love * Feel in touch * Feel the influence * Influence of love * I'm intoxicated - Where's my golden parachute when I need it? Son of a bitch, just 'cause the prick had a B.A. - A bad attitude? - No dummy, B.A., gets you laid while you're ridin' the high horse. Fired me for pussy. Well, that's a nice coat. What is it, like a hundred degrees outside? - It's classy, huh? It's Shinola. - Whoa, what's that? Who gave you the hickey? - I'm movin' on up. I don't want anything from here. Buncha junk. - I see you. Watch you come crawlin' back, like you always do, and he'll dump you, like they always do, and you'll end up selling it, like you whores always have. Stripper. - What'd you call me? - Stripper. - I'm not a stripper. - You know you can always tell a stripper by her purse, and the soles of her shoes. Stripper. - Did I spend all that money? I know I got an F in economics, but, this doesn't add up very well. - Helga, I would like you to meet Katya. - Hi. - I speak English, darling, I'd just rather not converse with, white trash. - Madame Sarah, so good to see you again. My Ladyship, I would like you to meet Madame Akatarina Vardiova. - Lovely to meet you, Madame Vardiova, I'm a tremendous fan. - Oh, please, call me Katya, My Lady. - Congratulations to you both. I just received my invitation in the mail today, as a matter of fact. - Oh, I'd be honored to have you at our wedding. I promise, it will be spectacular. - Well, I look very forward to seeing more of you. Godhardt has been a great service to the lodge and we all just adore him. - Oh, I'm sure they don't adore him nearly as much as I adore him. - Well it took a beauty like yourself to snag the heart of Godhardt. Or Lord Godhardt, I should say. - She had my heart, from the moment I laid eyes on her. It her heart that I needed to melt. - Oh, he's being humble. I fell head over heels for him, literally. - Did I tell you how we met? She was the prima ballerina in Swan Lake, and I was waiting outside for her with roses. She tripped over my foot, and nearly fell down a flight of stairs. - I fell right into his arms before I landed. No harm done. - Good thing you didn't fall down the stairs. - Ah, this is Helga. Helga was at the Rainbow Room and they were all very impressed with her. Do a little spin, Helga. - Well, I'm very impressed with your rags to riches story, Katya. From orphan to-- - Mrs. Godhardt Brandt. As they say at Seven Sisters, he will make me an honest woman. - Yes. Madame, the Prime Minister is here and he's a big fan of yours. He actually saw your first performance in Moscow at the Bolshoi a few years back. Could you please say hello to him? He would be so delighted. - Oh. Of course. - I promise to return her in just one moment. - Ah, why didn't you tell me that you are engaged? - Helga, calm down. - No, I want to go home! You're a big fat liar. You let me on. - Ah, Helga, I would like you to meet Count Vladimir Von der Hollenberg. This is Helga. - Miss Helga, call me Vladimir. Beautiful. You are the most beautiful woman at this party. Have you seen the garden? - Ah, I'm in love. I would give it all up just to be Mrs. Count Vladimir Von Looshkavitor, whatever his name is. - That's wonderful. - Oh he's splendid. He's perfect. Oh, Maria, have you seen my diamond, anywhere? - Which diamond? - The big one. - This one? Oh, I never imagined a man could make me feel this happy. I mean, with my ex, it just left me feeling hopeless. I think I was in it for the wrong reasons. I wanted to be the one that he made a famous dancer, so I trapped him. - Trapped him? - Yeah, with the oldest trick in the book. I know that one. You got pregnant. - But he outsmarted me and he trapped me with his dangling carrot. It was all just a means to an end, but, I never got to the end of the rainbow. - That is not good, Miss Helga. - It's a hot mess. But with Vladimir, he's my soul mate. He's like that big pot of gold I've always dreamed of. It's been almost six days, and I haven't heard from him. He loved me. - Loved you? How do you know this? - Because he told me so. - Your percentage. - Percentage of what? - From the gala, the man you spent the weekend with. From him. - What do you mean, Vladimir? - You were hired as an escort by him. I introduced you to him, so, therefore you get your percentage and I get mine. - I am not a prostitute. Get out. - You are a whore, darlin'. It's not a bad thing. - I'm not a whore. - It's the Madonna whore complex, and you, my dear, are the whore. I'm like a burger drive through, and, instead of a burger it's a whore, with fries and a soda, that they order. - I have managed to make an honest living in a g-string. How could you do this to me? - Here's 2,000 dollars. You have a talent for this, don't throw it away, Helga. - Good, okay, okay, we're gonna cut, print-- And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, a one, step and in-- Alright, could you guys, could you guys please do it once from the top? Sorry? - Once from the top, please? - A feast for your senses, the Star Dancers! - We will need to take X-rays, but it looks like she fractured her hip bone. It may take a year to heal, then rehab, before Mrs. Von Brausen can dance the show. - Darling we don't even know that she did it on purpose. Yes, she knows all the signature moves, she can do them at a moments notice, and she's got that star quality. - If we fire her, and are left without a star dancer, we risk losing our advertisers and our sponsors in the blink of an eye, okay? - Fire my fucking bitch understudy. - I'm having a panic attack. Shows cancelled! - Look, swe-- - That's it. Wow. - My darling you are the greatest Star Dancer of them all. This entire show will go into the toilet without you center stage. - I know. - You're a fuckin' bitch. You can make the understudy if you wanted to. - Okay, so the rhinestones have been secured to every one of the costumes. There is not a loose bead, or an ounce of fringe, that'll be hitting the floor ever again. - Very well. Let's get rid of those sequins while you're at it. Now I got a phobia of all things that glitter. How am I to dance? I still think the little whore slut did it on purpose. - Or, that himbo bitch did it. Okay, I came to my studio parking space the other day, and my tire on my smart car was popped-- - That's enough. That's enough of these conspiracy theories about the sluts and himbos, okay? Let's focus. We need to find another Star Dancer for tomorrow night. - We need someone with class and style. Who has formal technique training, but, with some dark secret, so we can blackmail her with it. So when I'm ready for my comeback she can be fired out of her contract as a moments notice. - I have an idea. Somebody get me a phone. Bring a phone in! Look, we're gonna call Madame Sarah. Okay? We're not members of the most powerful lodge for nothing. We will call in a favor, we will take advantage, and they will send us the perfect girl for the job. A feast for your senses, the Star Dancers! - No way! It's her! That bitch got my part. Do I know you? - I'd like to stick this in your g-string. - Call me. Yes? - I want you to get me in to see Star Dancers, front row, back stage. - I was just thinking of you. - I saw your bride on there, so. - I'll see what I can do. Helga, listen, there's someone I need you to meet. He saw you at the gala and he was enthralled. - What do you mean, a customer? No thanks. I made a deal with God, and lap dances is as far as I go. - What I have in mind for you is big business. Okay, I'll sweeten the deal. I will get you to see Star Dancer if you promise to meet him. Front row, back stage. Deal? - Well what does he look like? - He's nice looking. Older, distinguished. - Okay, if you promise to give me a golden ticket, then, deal. - Deal. - Honey I'm home. Who was that sweetie? - Ah, no one. Just an investor who wants to do business with me. I have another job for you, tonight. This one will pay as well, I promise. High class at a museum. I have big plans for us, you and me, baby, all the way to the top. There. - It's all arranged. So, how did it go last night? - Sucked. But I do what I have to do to get backstage Star Dancer, right? - High security at the studio, bring your I.D. - I lost my I.D. - No I.D., no Star Dancer. - Tell them my real name is Maria Strauss. Helga's just my stage name. - I. D. Maria Strauss? Yeah, okay. Go to stage five in back, security guy's got your name at the door. - Where the showgirls sizzle, and the star burns hotter than the sun. And now ladies and-- - Go over this one more time, please? Where the showgirls sizzle, and the star burns hotter than the sun. Live from Seven Sister's Studio here at beautiful Seven Sisters, and now call of the sirens, a feast for your senses, the Star Dancers! Print that one, I like that one. And we're gonna, okay we're movin' on, we're movin' on everybody, thank you. It was awful. They didn't even warn me of the body check for the audition. - Ugh, body checks are torture. - Body checks give them boners. - Body checks are worse than pap smears. - Would you guys please stop talking about vagina in front of me? Disgusting, you know I have a problem with pussy. - Hi Katya. You were amazing. Do you remember me? I'm Helga. - Who forgot to take the trash out? Guards! - Helga, I want to talk to you. I want to apologize to you for being such a bitch. - I understand. - I love Godhardt, more than anything. I'm jealous of you because of Godhardt. There I said it. - It's my fault for getting the wrong impression. He's only a friend, like a brother. - A brother? An agent, manager? He thinks you're gonna be a big star. Godhardt searches for girls that have special magic, that he can exploit. He wants to marry me because, I don't have it. - Katya, you are the Star Dancer. Of course you have it! - I'm not special, not like you. You have that red hot magic heat. Only that can live in his world. - You heated up. I watched you dance, and-- - I want what you have. I want that indescribable thing that makes people want to fuck you. - Oh. - I know it's whoreish, whorely, maybe you know a word that better describes it, but, you understand, yes? - I guess so. - I'll never be lonely, never abandoned, always craved. Godhardt says you want to be a dancer. - Yes I am a dancer. Well I was on my way to Julliard or Alvin Ailey, or, to take ballet classes, but. - Well maybe we can dance sometime together. You don't have to go all the way there for ballet class. I can teach you right here, in Seven Sisters. - I would love that, Katya. - Where do you dance? - Right here. - Perfect. - Let's start with the basics. First position. And your arms are in port de bras. Now, let me you see you do a triple pirouette, chasse, chasse, pas de bouree, prepare. Basics, look, look, look, you're not even spotting. Where you're focused, your body will follow. Again! - I have these daydreams of myself dancing, I imagine myself dancing so gracefully. - Well dreams are good. If you can see it in your dreams you must live it out through your body, then they become reality. Watch. Once you see it here, your memory, if it does the dance, you must feel it, feel it in here. A love, a passion, and then here, a primal creative instinct. Dance, Helga, dance! I don't know what's worse, you're dancing or your camel toe. - Oh. I was the best one in my whole Child's One class. I can't concentrate with all these problems in my life. I can't dance. - I learned a valuable technique when I was a child. The best advice I ever got. When life gets too hard and your problems get in the way, piss on them, and dance, Helga, dance. Dance. Dance through the floor. Helga, dance through the floor, dance through the floor. Dance through the floor. Ooooh! Whoa. Ooooh. You know, there's an art to good wiener. - See in Vegas, everyone's a vegetarian, no meat, just brown rice and vegetables and tofu dogs. I'm diggin' your wiener. - Hey, do you want to have children. - Honestly no. I'm the worst mother in the world. - I want to have children, lots of them. So does Godhardt. - Well I have a daughter. - Really? Was he rich? - No, I picked a poor one. My mother has custody of her because she gave up her dreams of being a star to be a mother, the state took her away from me. I know. It's okay because, I can't take care of a kid, I can't even take care of myself. - Well, I'm sorry that you lost custody of your daughter. What about the father? - My ex boyfriend, or ex fiance, whatever he's called? He's a small time drug dealer he makes these T-shirts with these dumb sayings on them, but he got his formal technique training at Alvin Ailey, but he just couldn't make things happen in the real world. - Unmarried with a bastard child? Hey, cheers. Men and life, bittersweet. We take the sweet with the bullshit. - You know, I put my heart and soul into thinking of this dance idea, and I went to him to ask him to choreograph it for me, and you know what he said? - What? - He said, that he wants this other dancer, this other chick, to have the lead part in my dance show. He says I dance like a junker mobile. He said I dance like a truck. And then it got worse. Then he rewrites my show, and he wants me to do this Martha Graham, avant-garde style dance and he, puts a gag in my mouth and has me have no makeup on, and puts me in a coffin, and then I'm stuck in the coffin for the rest of the show. - What a prick! - Yeah, I almost snapped on him, and stabbed him in the heart just like he did to me. - Well, my life as a prima ballerina hasn't been easy. - But I wish I had your life. - Well it's not been as glamorous as you think. I've paid my dues. And you know what, darlin'? It ain't pretty. Hmm-mm. It was ballet that saved my life. I spent my childhood in hospitals, but they provided this ballet program for us, to heal us. They kept shoving pills down my throat and trying all these barbaric techniques, but it was ballet that was my cure. Dancing keeps me sane in this insane world, but it's a tough business. I came from poverty in communist Russia. I had to claw my way all the way to the top, and as soon as you would get hot, they'd put out your fire, like a cigarette butt on asphalt. And the only thing you could do, was just try not to let them burn you out. Just fight with fire. - They could fry an egg on my asphalt. - That's what it takes. A burning desire, an obsession. - Katya can we do this again? You really inspire me. Goddess power. - Goddess power. - Bravo. What's wrong? - Didn't my fiance tell you? It's all about Helga? - No, I haven't talked to him. - Seems he's more interested in your career than in me. - Well, Katya, what do you want me to do? - I'd like to be alone. Security! There's a fan harassing me. Take this trash slut out. She is stinking up my dressing room. I was once the source of passion in his life, then he sees me on a pedestal. The mother, his mother, so I begin to mother him, crave the security from him, but he still craves passion. No longer the fountain he drinks from, he looks elsewhere, to drink from the whore's fountain. The whore cries a river of tears when he leaves her alone, and comes home to mommy dearest. You used to call me your love sponge. Now I know I'm losing you. Now all you call me is a good cook. - Helga, this is a big client for us, okay? I will talk with Katya. She is certifiably cuckoo, you know that, right? She hates me now. I haven't heard from her in a week. - You should thank her for being so tough on you. - I wish I could visit the set with her on the set. I was really enjoying that. - Take the world by your teeth and rip them to shreds. It's the only way you're going to get what you want out of life. - Oh! - Armand, let's put Helga in the show for me. My bonbon, she can dance, she can be my project. - Yes, I will oblige. - Show? - Let's not talk business tonight. Just take care of the business at hand. Pleasure. Ah, look who it is, my darling. It's our favorite studio exec. - Well the studio is going under. Since the lovely Mrs. Von Brausen injured herself it's been nothing but a headache, but I'm not here to discuss business. - Then undress! We can meet in the conference room to talk business. Pleasure is the name of the game tonight. If it's pillow talk you want, oh, I'm all ears - Thank you for inviting me to your anniversary party. - Oh, that's great! My prayers are answered. I'm gonna be a star. What kind of part is it? - Oh well, it's, like a horror film, like a suspense thriller type. - Okay. - Here, watch this. - Are you serious? A porno? - It's for private use only. We have contracts that cover all this. Who's that? - It's my maid. Is he killing her? Oh, no! - No, no, that's fake blood. What do think? - What was the director thinking? - Gotta go. Listen, there was a - Oh, would I play the part of the girl getting stabbed? Or the one-- - They will shoot you in the head. With a gun. Blow your brains right out. After the love scene. You and another girl end up dead. It's your grand finale, all fake though. It'll bring in a pretty penny. - Oh, Miss Helga, he's talking about a snuff film. - Snuff? Oh, I know what that is. Cowboys sniff it like chew. - No, it's not chewing tobacco. It's very evil. They find people like runaways, or homeless people, that they easily dispose, and they trick 'em into thinking that they're just shooting a porno, and then kill them on film. - Do you think he was serious? - This word. Blot. It is a Pagan worship of Odin. It is rooted in sacrifice to a deity. I saw it written on the disc. I study cases like this in my detective class that I'm taking. Miss Helga, don't do it. My paycheck can wait. - This is supposed to be a gated community. Can't they buzz? - I'm so sorry Helga. It's just that my relationship is becoming very hard on me. He's spewing venom at me. I'm dying of thirst. - Oh, Katya. You can trust me. - It's you that's the problem! Godhardt ignores what's happening in my life. Too busy to taste cake for our wedding? I'm all alone. Picking out ribbons and place settings. All I hear 24/7, Helga this, Helga that. I'm so dehydrated. And now he's frantically looking for a new one. We're all disposable. He has them auditioning imitating your charms trying to cast a new Helga. Is he losing his mind? There's only one Helga. - The grand finale. My grand finale. The death scene! He is serious. I must get out of Godhardt's web. - Oh, you're okay with body checks, right Helga? My understudy had a baby bump. She left today. - Sherman, you gotta understand. No, it's all about the ratings. If you don't have the ratings you don't get the sponsorship. No sponsorship means no ads, no ads means no audience, no audience means no sales. Right, yeah well, no sales, that doesn't compute. Okay. Mr. Von Brausen. I'd like to introduce you to one of my friends. She's an amazing dancer. This is Helga. - Hello. - Could you do me a favor, Mr. Von Brausen?

Accounting needs it ASAP, okay. - Oh. - Here hold this. - Ow! - Don't get blood all over the place. Let it drip to prevent infection. - I'm so clumsy. - Don't worry about the wardrobe. My assistant will take care of it. You pour the champagne my darling. - I'm on cloud nine. Our angel dance was like a slice of heaven. Imagine me in Star Dancer. I finally made it. And next, I will rise to be the Star Dancer. Like you, my love. I used to look up to you, now I look at you. - Well I wouldn't go that far Helga. I'm just so happy. - I'm so happy too, Helga. I told you, where you focus your body will follow. I'm so happy you're here with me. You are mine. - Here's bubbles. - Here's bubbles. - Katya my paperwork, it's not in order. It's complicated. - Are you in some sort of trouble? Or a checkered past? - With some dark secret, so we can blackmail her. - Don't worry. I'll pull some strings for you. They did for me. - Stop showing up unannounced. You leave a message at the front gate, that's how it works. You interrupt my creative, primal, my creativity. - You know what that is? - Money. - The highest paid whore I've ever booked. That's your percentage. - Thanks. They liked me. They were nice. - Explain. - Explain it. Well there was this salary problem and Mrs. Von Brausen was singing opera. - The show. I saw you on the show. Why wasn't I told of this? - Were we good? - I own you. You are mine. I want my percentage. - But I saw this show on TV, from my stripper room. It was my dream. - And I was the one that got you the job as that dancer. - No, Katya got me an audition. - No, no. You fucked the producer of that show, and his wife. And a studio exec in a foursome. I was the one that did all of that. I'm the one that setup your dream. Do you think all of this just wasn't planned? To be seen by them, doing what you do best. - But I auditioned for the part. - When you fucked them, that was your audition. - Why didn't you tell me about this? - Because you are dumb. I am the one pulling the strings and you are the puppet, Helga. I'm trying to move us all ahead, and you just keep messing things up. - But I'm living my dream. How is this messing things up? What's your dream? Owning whores? - You are nothing. Nothing but a dumb, beer bong slut. I molded you into what you are today, and now you're living the dream. Go figure. I want what's mine, and you are mine. Angel with a dirty face. You make me sick. - Have you ever considered becoming a male stripper? - Vegas whore. I'm gonna make you my star. Bitch. Hey. - Wait here. Where you goin' baby? They'll bring the stuff out to you. - What? - Damn girl. - My paperwork is coming. - Yeah, this is Rocco, take her around back of the building. Hey come back here! - I heard she fucked her way to the spot. - I heard her pussy was golden. - That's nothing darlin', mine makes diamonds. - Her lies, she fakes it. Her pussy makes rhinestones, the fake plastic kind. - Katya they must have moved my locker. Can I dress with you? I have an idea on how to get my work papers. I quit with Godhardt. - Why didn't you tell me you fucked my producers? - I thought you knew. - I own you. You're mine. How could you go and do this to me you stupid whore? You betrayed me. - He set it up as a job. It turned out to be the producers. You got me the audition, they liked me. - You sucked. I helped you and now you embarrass me with a slap in the face? - No, no. - It's just dumb luck, whore. - I found her. No. Katya! Katya help! - Let's go. - Welcome to the Rainbow Room, where the dreams you dare to dream, really do come true. You'll bring in a pretty penny. - Look, it's the lady who got thrown out of the zoom zoom. What do you want? - I think I am lost. - Now you're found! - Lord, of Demons, Pimp, of the glittering sin, Lord of Demons, - They will shoot you in the head, with a gun. Blow your brains right out. Helga,. - Pink lip gloss. What's this? Daryl Smith, A Hollywood producer. Well, little miss red riding whore, the big bad wolf is coming. - Blot. That was written on that disc. I knew that place looked familiar in that evil snuff film. Witches. Goddamn witches! Human trafficking, blood sucking, pimp ass witches. Oh, I'll put a stop to them if it's the last thing I do. Oh my God. I gotta teach Helga about the Seven Sister Witches. Hi, Uber-Nana. Is she here? It's urgent. - You just missed her Maria, and she was in such a hurry to leave. Gah, the witches! She can't escape the witches! Oh, no! - Oh. - Thanks for coming. - I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. - It's all a mess. It's just, it's past the point of no return. They called the asylum to take me away! But it's only you and me. We don't them, we don't need them! - Hey. - Oh yeah, I mailed it back to him. It was his grandmothers. - Ugh, he such a liar. He probably got it at a pawn shop. - Helga. I want to hear everything. I want to hear your story. Brothers, sisters. - Twin sister. She died in a accident. A bubble bath accident. The radio fell into her tub. I tried to revive her, but. This is my sisters remains. Her ashes, the carbon, turns into a diamond. It was an option at the morgue. It was burial, cremation, or ashes into a diamond. It's very expensive. My ex, he encouraged me to get a diamond because we're getting engaged. Luckily mom took out a life insurance policy on her, right before her accident. I feel like my, my sister's my guardian angel. A phoenix rising from the ashes. Isn't it strange that, when our souls leave our bodies, that all that's left here is the same stuff a diamond is made out of. - Diamonds in the rough. Precious jewels aren't made of stone, but of flesh. How was tonight? - Not so good. 43 bucks. I'm competing against trannies. - I'm sorry Helga, I thought I had more pull than that. Maybe we should head to Paris. - 43 bucks to my name. - My percentage? - Are you alright? - Fine. I twisted my ankle on a rhinestone. Slipped. But I'll be all right darling. - I wish I could have been your under study. - Yeah right. I know how bitchy you understudies can be. And besides, they want a real dancer. Skilled and trained. You just aren't good enough. But you are a great stripper. - You're Penny Slot. You're a hard woman to find. Detective John Clayburn, Vegas Homicide. I have a warrant for your arrest. You're coming with me. - You can't do this. - Oh yeah? Watch me. - Where you taking her? - Back to Vegas. Haven't you seen the commercials? What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, even the criminals and their crimes. Come on honey. You have the right to remain silent. Well there they are. - I need to see their asses. - 'Scuse me? - In Hollywood. - So you're a real movie producer? Alright ladies, let's see your asses. Turn around, counter clockwise. Go on. - Call me. Glove don't fit, you must acquit. That ass ain't a glove, sir. It's not her.
