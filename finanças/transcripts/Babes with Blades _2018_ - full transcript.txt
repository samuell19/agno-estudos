Subtitles by explosiveskull Resync by TonyStuck It was 12 years since the Visray laid waste to our home world. Run! 12 years since they ripped her from all that she knew. But 12 years since she escaped her captors surviving on the dark streets of Draiga. Relentlessly pursued, the orphan child became a savage fighter. Only flickers of her life before the Visray... ...remained. I want her taken alive, is that clear? Well, go and get her then! Not so clever after all. Section Commander wants her taken alive. We're not going to kill, sir! We're here to teach you all a lesson on how to catch one girl who's eluded you for so long. You see? All aggression, no finesse. So much for the mighty Sarnians. Finally she's gonna get what she deserves. Now you belong to me. Do what I saw or. Your turn to suffer. People paid good money to see the last of the Sarnians fight in the ring. Come on, Tallarin! Azura! Don't let her get away! She escaped to the loading tower. Send units on top we need to shut it down. Send reinforcements now! I have word that a new group of colonists are trying to stir up unrest and are stealing from the empire. They are calling themselves Freedom Fighters and they're growing ever more confident in their attacks, Ma'am. How tiresome. You know the drill, find them and kill them. Which is your favorite item, Peltarion? I've always been drawn to this one, Ma'am. An excellent choice aside from its aesthetic beauty this represents my greatest conquest. The single remaining living thing from the home world of our greatest enemies. The Sarnians treasured these flowers now all that remains is this and the girl. You sent for me, Ma'am? Do you like my collection, Sef? It's very nice, Ma'am. Nice. I expected more from you, Sef. It's a wonderful collection. I like dichotomy. Weapons of war alongside artifacts of great beauty. Peltarion here tells me that with his help you have finally captured the Sarnian girl. Your plan worked well, Ma'am, she's ready to fight now. Excellent. I can't have rumor spreading that a Sarnian roams free on this world. It's an embarrassment at the very least. I want the arena games to go ahead as usual. Keep the violent lusts of the mob sated. Show them that working with us has its benefits and at the same time we'll squeeze their water supply. Let them know the sooner the rebels have given up, the sooner the water will flow freely. When their children are dying of thirst we'll soon see how long the fire of rebellion burns. I look forward to seeing the last Sarnian fight in the arena. It's okay. I want to help. It's all right. I need to treat your wounds. I mean you no harm, I only want to help. I've never seen one like you before. I thought none of your kind survived. They didn't. I know nothing of my kind. I know only the dark streets of this place. All that remains of Sarnia is faded memories of a dead world. Don't speak like that. Defeat begins up here. If you are to survive this place, you need hope. Without hope you're truly in hell and you'll die out there. What do you care? I'm nothing to you, human. You're just like them. I'm human but I'm no Visray. You're all the same to me. Are we? I never saw your world before it was poisoned but we've all heard the stories of your people. How they fought, they were a symbol of hope. A sign that a Visray could be challenged. A false hope. Not while you live. Not while you fight. You're living proof that the empire can be defied. You're insane. I'm a prisoner and a slave. I live at their whim as do you. Yes. It was Sorrentine herself that ordered the poisoning. And that's why she rules here in this cess pit? A reward for defeating the empire's greatest threat. It wasn't always this way. She has stripped this planet bare. And leaves us with nothing. Rest. They'll be coming for you again. There's only two of them. It's almost too good to be true. Then we hit it, lightning raid. Yeah, get as much as we can and get out. Our people need those supplies. Let's move. Whoa, whoa, hey guys. You haven't seen a petite little lady around here, have you? Black hair, black eyes. About this high? No, there she is! Guard. Fill those bags. I think someone's coming. Okay, we have to move now. Just a few more. Quickly! Someone's coming, we have to go now! Okay okay, we're coming. Let's go! Hang on, hang on, hang on. Come on! Woo, we're all right. It was too close. That's what makes it such a rush. It's not a game do you remember that? We got out, we got the stuff, and no one got hurt. Okay. Okay, we need to head back to camp. We need to deliver this stuff to the people who need it. Sector 17 desperately needs medical supplies. Okay. Then we eat, I'm cooking. What, you don't like my cooking now? No one likes your cooking, Brook. Aw, shit. I can't hear you, scum! I can't hear you. Who else brings you the best, the brilliance, and the most brutal in entertainment? Who else can promise you and guarantee you blood for your edification? Tonight I bring you something very special. I bring you more than death, I bring you extinction. And this right here is from a world we brought down low a long time ago. We thought her kind were dead. It just shows you how wrong you can be. Ladies and gentlemen, serfs, slaves, and all sorts of scum, I give you Azura of Sarnia. As her opponent, your champion back by your demand, the beautiful, the deadly Andromeda. Yes, come on! So this is her, then? Yes, Commander. She seems quite unprepared. I tested her myself, Ma'am. She's not without courage. Could be entertaining to watch her die. For you, perhaps, but these animals will want more than that. I hope for your sake you did not rush her into combat too early. But you said... Go on! Disappointing. Hardly a product of old Sarnia. Kill her, Ma'am, let the Sarnian die at your order like the rest of her kind. Kill kill kill! We build her up then we crush the myths of her people once and for all when we her humiliate her again in the arena. It's good to have some comfort today, I really miss this. You think you have it tough? There's 500 people out there that would give anything for what you have. Together we can.. Together what? We can barely keep ourselves hidden and supplied. Your big plan is to make us a target to the Visray. If they discover what we're building, it's all over. I was just saying, that's all. Yeah, you talk too much. Listen to me. The Visray have cut our water supply. What you give the people helps, but it's just not enough. We do what we can, Ibu. But like she said, we can hardly keep ourselves supplied. I wish we could do more, but we are raiders not an army. That's not what I meant. Look, the Section Commander has let it be known that the water will be restored but only when the rebels are handed over. The person who does hand them over will be richly rewarded. Some say passage off world, even. Sooner or later, someone will turn you in. Divide and conquer. We can't just give up. No one's giving up. No one. But we can risk ourselves showing in the sectors now. But if we stick to the plan, soon the people will understand. I brought this for you. I have no need of books. It's more than a book, read it. Talks of your people. Why're you helping me? What do you want? I don't want anything, I just thought... That I'd be grateful? More than grateful? All right, I'll leave, I'm sorry. I apologize. No, wait. It is I who am sorry. You've shown me nothing but kindness and I have no reason to doubt you. I understand that it must be hard for you to trust anyone. When you've lived as I have, trust can get you killed. So this is the history of Sarnia? Well, I can't make much of it out, but it speaks of myth and legend. It's all so distant to me now. I remember running through the leaves, the blue butterflies. It was beautiful. But not fit for humans. How so? Gravity. Two and half times that of any other planet. That's why you're so hard to kill, so fast, so strong. And what is this flower? Ah, they're very very rare. It says they have restorative powers that they can bring life from death. Myth and legend indeed. When a thing is dead it's dead. Perhaps. I must go. You're a healer, yet you also repair these things. The Section Commander often says she enjoys dichotomy. I'm one of her little jokes, as you, last of the Sarnians. Her life hanging by a thread that she holds. I'm going to kill her, you know. I know. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should always pay your taxes. I'm just telling you how it is! For our next bout two women warriors from opposite ends of the system both worlds famed for their skilled arms. Up first, the fearsome Freya. As her opponent, ladies and gentlemen, and certain filth, I give you Azura. Fight fight fight fight! Freya was brave. She fought well. Despite what these animals want you should spare her. Come now, it's about education, Peltarion. You risk yourself, daughter. You need these supplies, and there's no risk, it's as black as pitch out there. How are things? We've got something big planned. We're nearly finished building a... Don't tell me, I don't want to know. If I don't know, I can't lie if I'm asked. I could stay, Mother, forget all this fighting. You could, but it's your example and others like you that inspire us. One day, you and yours will set us free. One day. Just be safe. The one and only, Azura. She gets better with each bout. Your plan was genius, Ma'am. The people love her. It could be a problem. I wanted a distraction, not a heroine. Her style of fighting has changed since I last fought her. It looks familiar to me. I've seen it before on Sarnia. Perhaps they're memories from childhood. No, you don't just make up moves like that. She's being taught. Impossible. The only person she has contact with is Kewan and he's not exactly what you call a warrior. Just find out who's teaching her and have them dealt with. I want her in prime condition. The people love her. She inspires them. Time, I think, to demonstrate that we control even their hopes. Sef, you remember the Rekaran, don't you? Yes, Dahlia, fierce and deadly she's... In the mines in Sector 9 for her disobedience. I'll pardon her. Have her sent for. Yes, Commander. Leave us, Kewan. You, my friend, you look worn, exhausted. I'm fine, Ma'am No. What you need is here. Bring her up to me! Up against the wall, Sarnian! You, search this pig sty. Have you been hiding anything from me? Section Commander thinks you've been getting some extra training from someone or something. Maybe something that traitor Kewan has been showing you. The only thing that he shows me is a bit of kindness, Sef. He heals my wounds and leaves me to my thoughts. And how do you pay this? Stop her! Bitch, I own you. All right, in you go. Get in there. Ah, right on queue. You remember Dahlia, don't you? From the Fire World. We're bringing her back to kill your pet Sarnian. She will kill you. You're good, very good, but you're not in the same league. Remove that body and dispose of it. You, guard the door. Make sure that no one speaks to her. No one comes in apart from Kewan and I want him searched every time. You all right? I'm fine, but where's the book? Safe. It's time. This cell's a mess. Clean it up. Yes, Master. Dahlia. If we are to fight, then someone must die. Let's give them a fight they'll never forget. Agreed. Me brainy, you brawny, leave it. What was that? Hey, we have a code, remember? Getting a bit scared, were we? I'm all weak with fear, trembling at the knees. - Did you get it? - Got it. All we need now is the crystal. It's been easy so far, we saved the hardest part for last. Oh, now who's scared. It's only rage, remember? Um, the most heavily fortified base in the sector. Been there, done that. Yes, but that was just for supplies and if we failed people would go without and it was only our lives on the line. This is much bigger than that. We don't have a choice. If the Visray don't control the water, they can't control the people. If this is a go, and I'm assuming it is a go, then we need to move and soon. Every day we stay here we risk discovery. Aye. Don't worry, Amber's an absolute genius when it comes to sorting out the impossible. It's not a joke, Brook. I didn't say it was. I was just saying that if anyone can do it, you can. No pressure then. Are you ready? You work hard for the empire. Sometimes we push you too hard. You will be rewarded. She carved her way to self-respect, the sexiest Azula. Look at her! Unbeatable so far, but memories are short. Not so long ago, another stood in her place. A great leader, Section Commander Sorrentine has brought her back. The mighty Dahlia! Two champions enter but only one will leave. Who will it be? Skilled arms or the gods that they pray to? Which one of them will die? Fight fight fight! Time to end this. So be it. They'll pay for this outrage. Greetings. For a minute there, I didn't think you were gonna let go. For a minute there, neither did I. Own this, bitch. Guards to the balcony! Azura, we have to go! I have to kill Sorrentine. Guards, now! This is our one chance for freedom, another time. Next time. Where's my guards? We're safe for now. They've never found this place. Well, they won't stop searching 'til they find us. No one who has never escaped the arena room lives. Then it's time that changed. We can't just wait for them to come looking we need a way off this world. All right, where do we go? They control this entire section of space. We have to do more than escape. We have to fight back. We have to give them more to focus on so all their attention isn't on us. Why have the people put up with this corruption? They had no choice. The Visray control the water supply amongst other things. There are a small number of rebels that have started to fight back but as soon as their numbers grow, Sorrentine sends in her elite guard and crushes them. Their leader is her personal bodyguard. You've experienced his skills already. No one has ever gone up against him and survived. Are they all like him? No. Not as strong or fast, but still brutal. But he's not human? No one knows. What is it? Nothing. Do you know how to contact the rebels? No. But I'm guessing stories of your little escapade will have got to them by now. They'll be looking for you. Well they won't find us here. Strength in numbers. So you're the women who escaped the arena? Observant. You need to move on. You embarrassed Sorrentine, she's not going to rest until you're both strung up. She'll have a long wait. Her men will be looking for you and that's bad news for us. We don't need that kind of attention. Why were you looking for us? To see if we can help each other. My enemy is your enemy. I'm going to kill Sorrentine myself. Oh, the Sarnian speaks. If it were that easy, we'd have done it already. Even if you could get to her, which you can't, her bodyguard would slice you to pieces. Your personal vendetta has nothing to do with us. Our responsibility is our own people. By stealing food and bandages? Not exactly long-term strategy. Oi, we do what we can. Besides, we got a plan. That's enough, Brook. But it's not enough. We need to do something so bold it changes the game. This is no game. Just stay out from our sector. I wish we could help but what you're planning is too dangerous. Our people come first. Come on. Then I wish you luck. That coulda gone better. Maybe, but it's just too dangerous to involve them now. Not when we're this close. Yeah, well, they can handle themselves. We could always use more fires. We can handle things without them. I know, I was just saying. Aw, shit. No! Know any Sarnian prayers? I'll say one for you. No, no. Amber, Amber, Amber, please! Amber! Amber! No! - No, no! - We have to go! We're not leaving her behind. We have to go now! She's dead, they're all dead. We go now. Quick, the guards, they're coming! - No, I can't! - You must. Hurry up! Come on, quick! I can't leave her! You had him, why didn't you strike? I don't know, something stopped me. It's like I've seen him in a dream but he's warped and changed somehow. And I feel a sickness in my stomach that chills my blood. It's like I recognize him or some part of me recognizes him. Poetic. You should have skewered the bastard. Yes, you should have. I'm sorry about your friends. They fought bravely. Save it! Sorry. It's just he, they're all gone. Amber. My plans have not changed. I'm going to kill Sorrentine. Join us, we can take on the Visray together. Let her rest. Let her grieve. No, it's okay. I'll grieve by taking them down by whatever means. But where will killing her get you? And think about the reprisals on my people. You are a fugitive. You need to think about surviving first. Listen, we were working on a plan. If we can't defeat the Visray, we can stop them. How? Our engineer was working on a shield generator. We were going to charge it up to stop the Visray from coming back to the sectors. With them cut off, we can rebuild and fight back. The truth is, if we make Draiga costly venture for them. They must just pull out and forget all about you. Right. But we can't count on that. Your engineer was working on the generator is he? Back there. Gully. I'm sorry about your friends, truly, but we can still help each other. Kewan is not only a healer, he is also an engineer. So, we could help you fix this machine of yours. There's a problem. Why am I not surprised? The machine is all but complete, but we don't have a large enough power source to make it viable. We know it works we just need the. The Cressfelt Crystal. Sorrentine's a bit of a collector of alien artifacts. The Cressfelt Crystal being one of them. It's a source of great power. Not infinite, but should be more than enough, am I right? So your plan was to break into the stronghold all along, a bold plan indeed. Yes, to steal it. To get in and out quietly, not to go in there and cause mayhem by killing their leader. It doesn't matter now, does it? We're going in one way or another. Well, we need more than just these. What about their guns? They're slow to reload. That's why the elite guard don't use them. - Recharging for a shot takes - Five seconds. Five seconds to close the gap. More than we need. Report? The rebels are all but destroyed, Ma'am. All but? One escaped along with Azura and Dahlia. The gladiators sought out the rebels? That is a troubling development. Azura knows our whole army will be after them that it will be difficult to stay hidden for long. I'd say she thought to stir up trouble so our attention is split. She was mistaken. Mistaken, but still at large. The elite guard searches for them, Ma'am, they will bring her to ground soon enough. I want the Sarnian alive, Peltarion. Is that wise, Ma'am? She's proven herself unruly, dangerous. As your bodyguard I urge you to caution and to have her terminated. Are you questioning me? Come, my friend, I fear that you suffer from a lack of clarity. What is this place? What are these things? Trophies from conquered worlds. This is it! Let's go. Wait. A flower... from Sarnia. I must take this back. Come on! I'd put the stone back if I were you. You are not getting out of this room. You are just so predictable. And you, Azura, your liberty is about to end. I'll draw their fire, then you've got five seconds to get in close. Go, I can make it. Take the crystal! Wait. I know you. Tallerin, it's you. You must remember! Tallerin, we were friends. You must remember. Running through the leaves, please Tallerin, think, you must remember, please. You must remember! Are you okay, Sir? I'm fine. Take her. Back where you belong. Tallerin. So. Why risk capture for a crystal? Tallerin, what have they done to you? Your eyes. It is irrelevant who you think I am or think I was. Answer the question. Tallerin, you must try to fight it. They have a hold on you, I don't know how. You must try and remember. Why steal the crystal? What are you going to use it for? Tallerin. Tallerin, please try to remember me. They have robbed you of your spirit. Robbed you of your identity. Tallerin, we are the last of our kind. Please, you must try to remember. Again. Wait. Leave us, Palterion. The other fugitives have the crystal, I want it back. Your skills are best employed in hunting them down. Leave this unpleasantness to me. Yes, Commander. There's nothing quite so satisfying as seeing an enemy brought low. You won't break me like you did Tallerin. Tallerin, yes, that was once his name but no longer. He is like you will be, utterly mine. You destroyed my world, and for that, I will see you dead. Defiance, an admirable Sarnian trait, you have so many. It is why you are so hard to defeat and why I've chosen a Sarnian for my personal guard. Personal slave, you mean. I suppose I do. Quite amazing what one can do in a laboratory. A concoction of my own devices. Engineered to react specifically to your Sarnian biology. You, like your friend Tallerin, will be reprogrammed. Your unique skills and strengths you'll retain, of course, but your will, that will be utterly mine. Well, if it'll shut you up, let's get on with it. Ha, defiant til the last. As you wish. Begin the reprogramming. Yes, Ma'am. Bring her to me when she's more compliant. Yes, Ma'am. We've lost power, switch it back up! Good to see you. How did you shut off the power? We didn't, it just went off. Convenient. Have you two finished? Come on, let's get the hell out of here. Barbarians. We will recapture them, Ma'am. Commander, I assure you, they will be found. She tried to take it. Ma'am? The flower of Sarnia, Peltarion, your favorite artifact. Like the Cressfelt Crystal, this has great power. They say it can heal worlds. I want it destroyed. The Sarnian, Azura, claims she knows me. I can't help but feel that she's right. Is it true? Am I a Sarnian? Of course. Your race are the best fighters we have ever encountered. Who better to protect me? But your kind are wild, emotional, and disordered. I gave you a purpose, brought out your finest qualities, made you magnificent. A precision instrument of death. Thank you. Finally, glad you're safe. Did you get it? I saw it. The last piece of Sarnia. A flower. A flower survives. She kept it as a trophy. If legends are true one flower could breathe life back into your world. It can do that? A flower? I must get it back. I must take it to the waters. Return it home. Don't worry, we'll set this machine up and bring back your flower if it's that important to you. It doesn't matter. Even if it could get back to Sarnia, repair the damage, what's to stop the Visray from returning? We build a second shield. Then we kill Sorrentine, steal back a flower, and heal a world? Couldn't be simpler. Agreed. - But first. - But first we honor our bargain, Viridian. We heal your world first. Wait, I'm unarmed and alone. I wish only to speak to Azura. Take him! - Wait. - Why? It's a trick, he cannot be trusted! I want to hear what he has to say. I want to hear him say please don't kill me before I silence him forever. I know, you'd be a fool to take me at my word, but I've remembered, I know now what Sorrentine has taken from me. From us, Azura. Let's kill him while we have the upper hand. Wait, I have proof. If you don't believe me after this, then do your worst. Sorrentine ordered me to destroy it but I couldn't. Something stopped me. We're underwhelmed at your sudden attack of conscience, let's kill him and get the hell out of here. How do you think you got out of there so easily? Because I turned off the power. Nobody else could have done that, ask him. Besides, if I did want to betray you you'd already be dead by now. I've led no one to you, I come in good faith. Take it. It is yours. Thank you, Tallerin. Sorrentine has robbed us of all that we are, Azura. Your words struck me harder than iron. They made me remember. Us playing as children in our world before the Visray came and crushed us. You, and this, they made me remember. It was like awakening from a nightmare. I would have her pay for what she's done to me, to us, to our people. What about my people? How many have you ordered killed or killed by your own hand? A flower and a childhood story doesn't make up for that. We're not Sarnians. We're humans, Draigans, and this is our world, these are our people. I cannot undo what has been done. Even if my actions were not my own they do not absolve me of my crimes. At least let me offer you this. I know the ways of the Visray. I've lived as one of them, let me help you save your world from suffering the same fate as my own. He could be useful. He was my childhood friend, Viridian, and he's back. I can see it in his eyes. What say you, Viridian? Am I to live or die? The Visray are already hunting you, they were arming the airships as I left. Then we don't have much time. - Thank you - Don't thank me. When this is over you and I will have our reckoning. Not that way, there's patrols looking for you. You're sure? Yes, I ordered them. Look, don't worry, I've left a gap for you, go! We need to get her out of here. This way! I thought you said you left a gap. Yes, but the elite guard are trained to think for themselves. They may avoid in the search area. May have? It doesn't matter, we have to push on. He saved my life, he saved my life. Right, come on, we need to move. Leave me, leave me. I thought you said we don't leave our people behind. You're not my people. I'm not leaving you. Nor am I. There's no time, Tallerin and I will finish this. Do you have the crystal? Let's go. Azura, wait, you forgot... You forgot to say goodbye. We're approaching the Visray water supply. Yes, we're going to enclose it within the shield. I know. Wonderful performance Peltarion. And forgive me, Tallerin. How could you? You're a fool, Azura. I don't need your memories of a conquered world of pointless myths when I'm part of something far greater. If you think you could use my crystal to power your generator, you're sadly mistaken. It is you who are mistaken. You think we'd trust him? The others will soon bring the generator online. And when they do, it is you who will be trapped in here with me. Come on, let's get you down. Steady and. He had me convinced. Maybe he's for real, but Azura wasn't taking any chances. What you're playing at? She doesn't trust him. We need to get to the generator. Come on, help me up. One, two, three... Do you think she'll make it? Such a pretty delicate thing. Without water it will die in minutes. Ships are coming. Can you do it? I'm on it. Quickly! They're almost here, hurry up. All right, great. You did it, my beautiful man, you did it. She sought to protect this. It killed her in the end. I think we did it. We actually did it. She'll be fine. The bombing will begin soon, we must leave. What? The shield. Please, don't kill me. Peltarion, help me! Spare me, and I'll see that Sarnia is restored. You could do that? I swear it. Sarnia will be restored. Yes, but not by you. No! What've I become? You saved me. You saved me from who I've become. Oh gods, Azura, what have I done? It's over now. It's over. Azura was right, it was over. The time would come again when Dahlia, Viridian, and Azura the Sarnian would take up arms and fight together again. But that, that is another story.
