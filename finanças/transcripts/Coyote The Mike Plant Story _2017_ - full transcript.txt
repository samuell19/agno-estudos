[Serene instrumental music playing] [Rodger Martin] When you think about the sea, about the oceans, if you put your little finger or your toe in the water here, that connects to every continent on this earth. It allows you to go on adventures that you can't do on land. There aren't stop signs or you don't come to a place where there's a fence that says,"Do not enter." It's an astounding freedom. People ask why I do this stuff. It's... It'd be really easy to... explain it today, wouldn't it? It's gorgeous out here. [Martin] There are some treacherous places that people wouldn't believe. It's fantastic to survive it. Ocean is such an incredible color. It is so deep blue. You can't believe it's the same ocean that's off of New York City. God, it's nice out here, though. [Martin] There are places you should not enter, but you have to find that out for yourself. [Jason Davis] There are among us a very few people, who will risk their lives in chasing a dream, or trying to achieve some amazing objective. And that's what makes them magical, and that's why we need them. Because they stretch our imaginations. And they bring us to places that we can't possibly go ourselves. There's nothing in Mike Plant's world that he didn't think he could do. So you rarely say that about a human being no matter what he does. Single-minded, toughest guy I've ever met. [Billy Black] He was America's greatest solo sailor. And a pioneer in that field. More people had been to the moon than had sailed around the world. [Jason] Who else would we learn to admire and follow if we didn't have adventurers, if we didn't have people that strive to reach the top of Mount Everest, or the bottom of the ocean, or the North Pole, or sail around the world single-handed... You know, wouldn't it be a dull place? It would be really dull. [Captivating instrumental music playing] [reporter 1] The longest sailboat race of the world is about to get underway. A Minnesota man who is going to be part of it, Mike Plant, is loading the boat... [reporter 2] ...as a single sailor and his boat, to make it all the way around the world, faster than 24 other competitors... [reporter 3] And you're all alone out there. I mean, it's just you and the ocean, and as we said before, you're out there by yourself for eight months. [Interviewer] Well, Michael, who are you? What's your life history in brief? Who are you away from? [Mike] I grew up in Minnesota. Learned how to sail on Lake Minnetonka. [Interviewer] What kind of business do you run? [Mike] I've been in the home-building business. Building spec homes, remodeling. [Interviewer] And how old are you? I didn't even know that. [Mike] Thirty-five. Thirty-five. [Interviewer] What makes you enter this race in particular? Which is probably the toughest single-handed race there is. Something you can't go any further than, except navigation. Why did you choose to enter this? [Mike] Oh, the whole idea fascinates me. It's a fantastic challenge. I just have this gut feeling that I will be very good at this. [Helen Davis] I fell in love immediately with Mike Plant. He was shy, which I liked. Obviously, his eyes were beautiful. We just clicked. Sometimes it happens in life. I don't really know that much about Mike Plant's past, except for hearsay. I really know him from Newport. From what I have heard, he was a different person here. We had adventures, we had adversities, we had tears, we had laughter. You name it, but we were soulmates. Mike told me his dreams immediately. He told me he watched a movie about solo-sailing around the world, and that he wanted to do it. [Man narrating] On the 28th of August at noon, sixteen boats, captained by men from eight nations will set sail on a race that would take them around the world. For each, the race stands as the ultimate challenge of planning, endurance, courage, and resourcefulness. Here, they will be taken to the limit, and beyond. Not just to finish, but to survive. [Tom Plant] He walked out of that movie theater transformed. The light bulb of all light bulbs went off, and everything clicked. And everything began to make sense to him, that this is his legacy. You know, he's figured it out. And I looked him right in the eye, and I said, "Then what are you waiting for?" This video stuff is just really dangerous because... I saw one about four years ago, and it almost got me killed. It was a story about the first BOC race. [Laughs] After I saw it, I immediately decided that it was something I wanted to do. Thought if I worked my butt off for a couple of years, I could come up with $100,000, and I thought that'd be enough to do it in a secondhand boat. Well, that idea was full of holes. I thought about it a little bit more, and I thought, "Well, that's not really the right approach. That's not Mike Plant. If we are gonna do this, let's go for broke." So I started talking to designers and I... I settled with a designer in Newport, his name is Rodger Martin, and I commissioned him to draw a boat. Considering the financial rewards he got for it, he might say something more like "robbed." But the fact is that Rodger drew a beautiful boat. When we met, I had a lot of ideas that Mike liked. A lot of ideas were in common. And he decided pretty quickly to go ahead and have me design it. We knew within less than half an hour, maybe ten minutes, that we were gonna do this together. It was ideal. He had absolutely no money, and I was leaving my job to have absolutely no clients. So we were both completely, you know... We didn't have anywhere to go but up, [chuckles] I guess. He wasn't a perfect yachtsman, I might say, when he came in. He had two days' growth of beard, and he'd had a couple of beers at lunch. It was very soon afterwards, like the next day, I'd sketched overnight or something, had a drawing that ended up being, as is often the case of preliminary sketch, you struggle from that to make it into the boat. But actually when you design the boat and the boat's built, you look back and feel, "Oh, my God, it was all there in the first place." We knew that that's what we were gonna do. That wasn't revolutionary in any means, it was evolutionary. I don't think that that was the time to... to start taking wild risks and doing anything crazy. You can build a boat in your basement with plywood, but to build a boat to go around the world... I was a bit worried that Mike didn't have enough knowledge of what was in it. But you could just see he could do it. It was just that clear. To build a boat like this, you've got to first flesh out the shape of it. Then you have to make full-sized templates for it. A "matrix." And then fiberglass it outside, and fiberglass it inside. He did this in ten days. That's a job that takes a professional two weeks. That's the first thing you do when you're building a boat. When I saw he could do that, I realized he could do anything. [Linda Simmons] I had a phone call in the middle of the afternoon one day from my mother, who said, "Mike just called from Newport, and he has decided to build a boat, and sail around the world." And I said, "Mom. What? Build his own boat and sail around the world?" I said, "Mike, how are you going to do that?" This... 'cause a big shed and it was dripping water. "I am just... I've read about it." So I don't know. Maybe he read about how to do all those things. [Harry Sherman] There was a book, Lofting Made Simple orMade Easy. Mike read this book in a weekend, maybe two, then he said, "We're just gonna start building the boat." Neither one of us had ever done it before. But I just had... And, you know, Mike was so intuitive, if he put his mind to something, he'd just figure out how to do it. But he was perpetually running out of money. That would be... No, I don't think that's gonna be a problem. [Mike] I'll get a little bit of money, but never enough to keep the momentum. Every couple of months, the crew would have to be dispersed. There'd be a month or two interlapse, where I had to raise more money. And we moved the boat six times because I was always looking for the cheaper rent. It took almost two years. [Martin] Mike raised money to buildAirco by getting in-kind support. Then he also raised money from family and friends, and I think people really did things for him for less than the cost of it, or else, sometimes, for nothing. So it was very much scraped together. [Helen] You know, he used to call and call and call people. He just didn't stop. And he didn't take no for an answer. If somebody said no, he'd pick up the phone and call again, and try and get the next person in that corporation. [Mike] There's a long ways between a piece of paper with some lines on it and the actual boat that you are able to sail, and I finally saw it. It took a long, long time to build that boat. About a year and a half of juggling. [Martin] Boat was called Airco Distributor because they had put in some money, certainly not enough for the whole boat, but a big help. [Mike] So I was fortunate, halfway through the project I was able to secure some corporate sponsorship. The name of the boat becameAirco Distributor. Very thankful for that. We wouldn't have made it without them. [Man] The day of the launch, it was a cold, wet, rainy, miserable day. I remember, it was a pretty small crowd there. [Helen] It was a relay of all kinds of people that you would never think would be together. It was just remarkable to be there and feel that, and be part of it was wonderful. [Martin] I wasn't joyful, because I think if any designer, who is seeing his first boat launched, tell you he is joyful, I would hesitate to believe him. It's so easy on a boat design to make a factor-of-two mistake. In other words, whenever you do a calculation for something that is symmetrical, you do it for one side, and then you double it. But what if you forget to double all the work you've done for that side, in the weight estimate, in the buoyancy calculation, where it will float, those things. The factor of mistake will be a hundred percent. God bless this boat. God bless Michael. And as I sail, near and far, in seeking their ultimate challenge, this day, April 10th, I... 1982... 1986. I christen the global challenge. - Yay! - [All cheering] Okay, all... [indistinct] [Martin] You're so relieved, euphoric with relief, when you see the boat go into the water. That was a moment of great relief to both of us. I mean, all his work could have been for nothing. Especially if it was overweight. And it was perfectly on weight, because he built it, you know, exactly as planned. [Kathy Giblin-Stark] To watch that boat go in the water that day really created quite a stir. He became a legitimate contender at that point. Even though he did not have the budget that many of the European contenders, particularly the French competitors had... He was nothing if not determined to get to the start line of that race. [Sherman] That was the beginning of his life, that day. I mean, it started over. Mike saw that he actually was gonna make it to the start line. It wasn't gonna be easy. He had a lot of money to raise, but things were coming together. The boat was fantastic. Everything he'd dreamed about for two or three years before was coming to fruition. [Mike] I think I've put together a boat that's very capable. I am confident that I can drive it for long periods of time. I think I am gonna do a good job of it. This around-the-world solo yacht race is so demanding that in order just to qualify, every participant has to sail across one of the world's major oceans alone. And that's the next thing that Michael Plant is going to do. Jason Davis with photographer, Don Ferdell, Newport, Rhode Island. [Martin] To qualify for the BOC Challenge, each skipper had to do a transoceanic voyage, unassisted and unescorted. Minimum of 2,000 miles. So Mike got permission to do his qualification to the Azores, which is, arguably, it's 1,980 miles away, I think. That's a good 2,000 miles. Let's have a look. - You have enough bananas? - Huh? - They're the greenest ones they had. - Okay. [Indistinct chatter] Thanks, buddy. I'll be thinking of you. Hi, Gary, are you orchestrating this? [Sherman] The day he left to go on this qualifying sail, Mike had sailed the boat a little bit out on the bay, but he'd never gone single-handed sailing. And this was a big step for him. Hurray! You look beautiful! So does she. [Helen] Everybody was just so exhilarated, and happy and excited, and I mean, we just... we all were happy that he was going off on his journey, living his dream. [Black] I've got a great photograph of Mike sailing out of Newport that day. And the boat is just steaming up wind. It's just beautiful, he is in sync with it. And that boat loved him, I think. [Captivating instrumental music playing] [man] Here is one of the most exciting times of Mike's life, and that Mike has finally pulled all this energy together into a very positive goal. All of a sudden, that came to an abrupt halt, and he is in prison in the Azores. [Jason] On a qualifying run to the Azores, Mike Plant was arrested and jailed on an 11-year-old warrant issued by the Greek authorities. Details are sketchy, but Mike's father, Minneapolis attorney, Frank Plant, said by phone from Lisbon, Portugal today, the charges stem from a charter Mike made in 1975. He's in the Azores and they take him in shackles to Portugal, put him in prison. The mood in the team after Mike was arrested was just complete crush. Um... All the steam was taken out of it. We didn't know what was going to happen from there. We had no idea. Only Mike knew what was going on really. But what we knew is that his... his race was in jeopardy, and he was incarcerated. And we weren't exactly sure why. [Ominous instrumental music playing] [Mary] Mike ended up by doing what he'd always wanted to do. I think he talked about sailing around the world long before he did it. [Mike] This is where it all began. I did live here for a long time. As a kid, we used to sail a lot from right here. And we had good instruction. We learned how to sail a boat, how to move a boat, how to feel the boat, and how to get the most from it. When he was two, he was bringing everything up to his eyes. So down we went to get the eyes checked, and sure enough, he was legally blind. And then he got little glasses. Cute little glasses. [Simmons] I think he was angry, and I don't blame him, to be stuck with Coke-bottle glasses. I don't remember him being teased. But I am just thinking he must have been, because he was one of the only kids that had these really thick glasses. [Mary] When Mike was eight or nine, he took to the water, sailing on Lake Minnetonka. The yacht club was just a short distance away from the house. And that's where they took sailing lessons. He said, in later years, when he was sailing the bigger boats, that a lot of what he'd learned or did in the bigger boats, he'd learned sailing on Lake Minnetonka. [Frank] He just loved to sail so much that rather than just sailing in the races and the sailing schools, as the others pretty much did, he would be out there, all morning, all afternoon, by himself. And he generally was a pretty good kid. I mean, as a young boy. But when he got older, he just kind of catered to trouble. [Julia Plant] He was always the black sheep. He just couldn't stand authority. Not in his teens did we see anything positive with Mike. It just kept snowballing. [Tom] It's like a roller coaster ride. I think he was 13, and he decided to take out the family car, and drive it around town. And he totaled it. He kind of went crazy. I mean, he just was doing one thing right after the next. I mean, he was arrested by every police in the entire Minneapolis kind of area. So he must have gotten some sense that he could be a bad boy and get away with it somewhere along the line. [Mary] That was Mike. He needed an outlet. [Man] Outward Bound does seek to provide a crucible of experience which will catalyze one's personal growth. There is, however... [Tom] The whole point of Outward Bound is it truly does push you to what you think your limits are, and then beyond. And if you actually go beyond, you know, that's kind of, you know, an eye-opening experience. No surprise why Mike flourished. 'Cause that was right up his alley. [Mary] It was good for Mike. I think he got a lot out of it. [Tom] I think Outward Bound probably meant more than I even realized for him, because it was sort of getting him ready for the next life adventure, and probably gave him and taught him some skills that he needed at some point, whether sailing around the world or walking through South America. [Simmons] Mike left one night after dinner. And he said, "I am leaving right now to go to South America." And I thought, "This can't be." And it was raining. But it was also night. On foot. I have no idea how he even got as far as Mexico. [Mike] I went down to South America when I was 19. I'd been working at the Outward Bound school. Of course, they teach, as we all know, survival skills. I always felt that it was a little bit too structured to really represent a survival situation, and I went down to South America to create that. I basically traveled for nine months, hitchhiking. [Julia] He discovered, while he was in South America, this brand-new thing for him and for many of his friends, cocaine. He realized, after thinking about it, "Well, I know how I can capitalize on it. I can go back and buy cocaine and bring it back into this country. And I'll make a lot of money that way." [Sherman] When he went to South America, he had some notions about doing some illegal deals, smuggling. He didn't want to be a drug smuggler per se, but he might just like the adventure, like the thrill, of being on the edge of getting caught. If there was a way he could do this, and get the money he needed... He always was looking down the road at what he wanted to do next. That was a thing about Mike. His whole mission was to make enough money to buy a secondhand sailing boat. And so all the selling of the cocaine, he had a sufficient amount that he could buy the secondhand boat. He saw advertised in one of the yachting magazines this small boat that he really liked a lot, but it was in Greece. [Sherman] Mike and I met in Greece many years ago, and I fell in love with the place. You could live for nothing. The dollar was really strong. Two people go out and have a full-blown meal for a dollar and a half. I don't know why he came to Spetses specifically, but I think he came to look at the Misselthrush. This was the boat that eventually he ended up buying. [Mary] He had a boat in the Greek Islands. His idea was to charter people from one island to the next. [Tom] He had found a wonderful life sailing in Greece. Transporting people back and forth, and chartering the boat, and, you know, pretty glamorous, right? Not being there, not seeing it, you know, you hear the stories and you think, "Man... You know, he always does this fun stuff." [Sherman] What he was telling people, and what he was ultimately going to do was, of course, two different things. He'd hooked up with three people in Rhodes. They hire him to take theMisselthrush over to Turkey, and these people bought a few kilos of hash. And then Mike sailed them back to Rhodes. They offered to pay him, but Mike said, "No, I don't want cash. I want five kilos of hash." So they gave him five kilos of hash. And Mike was left behind on the Misselthrush in Rhodes. A few days go by, Mike's sitting on the boat, and he hears this clattering on deck. It's the Greek police. Somehow, they didn't find Mike's stash. They take away his passport, and they told him he wasn't allowed to leave the harbor, and they would be keeping an eye on him. As soon as it got dark, Mike snuck out of Rhodes Harbor, turned north, and sailed into Spetses. And we're standing outside, Mike's just gotten to telling me the story, and I said, "Mike, you know, they're gonna look for you everywhere." And I am looking over his shoulder, and I saw around the far corner, about four or five motorcycles coming with Greek police in uniform out on the bikes. And my heart just comes into my mouth. I don't think that it really phased him. I think he just wanted to get the hell out of there, because he knew if he got caught, he would do 20 to 30 years in a Greek prison. He took off into the hills, shirtless, shoeless, penniless. Gone. That was the last time I saw Mike for seven years. [Tom] And that's where the fictional character starts kicking in. We all live by certain guidelines. He had very different guidelines, different rules. And that can bring a lot of trouble and a lot of problems, but you could just sense that he was destined to do something really special. [Reporter] Today, the Greeks asked the Portuguese to hold Mike Plant for another 25 days, while they prepare a request for extradition. Plant's mother Mary and father Frank, went to the prison in Lisbon this morning to tell their son the bad news. Oh, God, that was tough. And I'll tell you, that was really, I... I cried and I cried and I cried. He was a good kid, I mean, I know people say, "How could you say that?" Well, he was. Okay, he did things he probably shouldn't do, but that's the way the laddie feels sometimes. It turned out there was an outstanding warrant for him on Interpol. They found him guilty in absentia of smuggling, even though they never ever found any drugs. Well, their guess is, because he fled, as far as they were concerned, that was an admission of guilt. The boat was in the Azores, left basically unattended. So they flew a guy over there, ended up getting on the boat and looking after it, and eventually sailing the boat back to the States for Mike. [Reporter] Today, Mike Plant's father Frank spoke to us by phone from Lisbon, Portugal. He said they've waited for two weeks and no news is good news. [Frank] It was up to the Greek authorities to put in papers, asking for Mike's transfer decrees. And they didn't do that. I think today is... We're assured it was the last day they had to do it. So Mike should be released tomorrow morning. [Helen] Mike's parents went over to Portugal. They had an associate with Papandreou, I believe, and it was actually his mistress. [Sherman] The rumor I heard was that whoever was responsible for collecting the information in Greece to ship to Interpol was a Minnesotan woman that was maybe married to some political or a minister. And she had access to the files. And the files were on the desk. And she took his file, which was just a little bit down, you know, and she put it on the bottom. The documents that were supposed to be sent to Interpol were put under her mattress until the 30-day period went by, and they had to release Mike. [Reporter] Mike says he will immediately resume preparations for the single-handed Round the World yacht race, which begins on August the 30th. [Helen] He let everybody know he would be coming home, and he called and said, "I will arrive at Providence airport," which is approximately 23 miles from Jamestown. So, of course, I went up to the airport and I was waiting, and waiting and waiting, and waiting. And finally I said, "Did this flight come in from New York?" And they said, "Oh, absolutely." I said, "Oh, God, I missed him." I mean, he'd just come from... I mean... He didn't even wait around to see if I was there. He walked home from Providence 'cause he was so happy to be free. That incarceration even motivated him more to be free on the sea. [Reporter] How do you feel about things? Yourself, your physical condition, your psychological condition, the boat's condition. [Mike] Last couple of weeks have been really... real hectic. I feel little bit run down, but I will catch up. I'll catch up on it. We've accomplished a hell of a lot in two weeks. I mean... Boat looks good. - [Interviewer] Feel good about it? Confident? - Hmm. Hmm. [Giblin-Stark] He was clearly relieved, and desperately wanted to get back on track, make up for some lost time, and get to the start line. The clock was ticking. [Jason] Mike Plant is a survivor anyway. He could survive a murder challenge. 'Cause he just is one of these people that survives this kind of thing. Because people come and help him. He engendered that kind of response in people. That, "How can I help this guy?" I've always felt that. "How can I help you?" And we helped him by publicizing his efforts. It's important that they make sure that everything aboard that boat works perfectly before the race begins, not only to give Mike Plant a chance of winning, but to make sure that he survives six or seven months alone at sea. Jason Davis, Channel 5, Eyewitness News, Newport, Rhode Island. [Martin] He just came straight back at full steam. You couldn't tell he'd left the room. He was a lot lighter. But he was very much the same drive to get it finished. [Mike] What are we gonna do about the tail ride? We can't do a damn thing about it. It's disgusting, I'm pissed off. - Look at this fucking mainsail. - [Indistinct chatter] Fucking leeches still falling off of it. Son of a bitch. [Herb McCorrmick] People have been sailing around the world for centuries. But sailing around the world alone is a whole different story. In 1967, Sir Francis Chichester, a famous British aviator, sailed all the way around the world, stopping only once in Australia. [Reporter 1] The crowds are now lining the barriers, perhaps six or seven... [reporter 2] This is a moment I shall never, never forget. Sir Francis Chichester andGipsy Moth are home. And listen to the welcome they are giving him from these ships out here in Plymouth Harbor. Harking back to the great days of the British Empire when a lone British adventurer went off and conquered the world, and Chichester did that. Then a couple of years later, the first Round the World race, single-handed Round the World race happened. The Golden Globe race was a nonstop race. And the idea was, you had to sail around the world, without assistance, without stopping. Two stars of it were French and English, Robin Knox-Johnston, who was a British merchant mariner, and Bernard Moitessier, who was this sort of lyrical Frenchman. Moitessier got down around Cape Horn and sailed three-quarters of the way around the world and decided that the whole competitive aspect of it just went against his soul. So he decided to continue onward to an epic voyage in which he sailed nonstop, one and a half times around the world. Moitessier did not finish that first race, but he wrote a book about it calledThe Long Way. And that book inspired a whole generation of young French sailors to go out and try to emulate Moitessier. And the French really, very, very quickly became the dominant players in the sport of single-handed sailing. It was kind of like the X Games, before the X Games really even happened, you know. It was one of the first extreme sports. It was a sport that you really had to have your wits about you. And then there wasn't another one until the 1982-1983 BOC Challenge, which started and finished in Newport, Rhode Island. [Reporter] On the foggy morning of May 9th, at 11 minutes past 7:00, Philippe Jeantot sails across the finish line into Newport Harbor. First in Class I, first in all four legs, and a full ten days faster than anyone has ever done it before. [McCormick] First BOC Challenge was won by a guy named Philippe Jeantot. He was the epitome of what Moitessier had started, this young French sailor who was very hungry and this rugged handsome dude. He was the one guy who would actually build a boat purposely for the race. Most of the guys showed up with double-ended cruising boats that had been modified for racing. But Jeantot showed up in a boat that had no real interior except for a central navigation station. It had twin rudders, it had water balance, completely stripped out of any kind of amenities, or luxuries, or anything of that sort. It was just meant for one person to sail the boat as efficiently as possible. [Jason] Twenty-five men will sail from here tomorrow afternoon on the longest and surely the most dangerous sailboat race ever devised. Around February or March next year, the winner will sail back into Newport Harbor to collect the grand-prize money, $15,000. This is not a race for the money. [McCormick] By 1986 and 1987, it was certainly a much more competitive field. At that point, there were two classes in the race. Class I was for boats 50 to 60 feet, and Class II was for boats 40 to 50 feet. I think he would have wanted to enter Class I, but he didn't have the money or the support to do that, so it was a smart move for Mike to go in the 50-foot class. [Giblin-Stark] Mike Plant's PR story was, a ruffian, who grew up sailing on the lakes of Minnesota, who really knew his stuff but perhaps didn't have the level of sophistication, or a polished campaign that some of his competitors had. We have some new sails that we have never had before that we have to get up and... There's a lot of things to do today, and a lot of things to do tomorrow. [Interviewer] Can you do it all in time, Mike? Oh, yeah. So here was a guy who was up against the odds, up against some of the finest single-handed sailors in the world, but he was completely determined and committed to it, and he was gonna pull it off. He was gonna be the guy from America who did it. [Read] Back in the mid '80s is when I first met him. And here he is, a local, he could help put our company on the map, in a way. The rest is kind of history. All of a sudden, we were big boat sailmakers. He was a game changer, in essence, a revolutionary here in this country, because not only was he gonna go sail single-handed around the world, he was gonna go take on the mighty French, the people who were completely dominant in the arena. So I had this incredible respect level for the guy just for what he was trying to do. [Helen] I think all of the sailors have a hero. Mike's hero was Jacques de Roux, and he was a Frenchman, and he had already sailed around the world. [Jason] The French competitors, they were the ultimate adventurers. And they were well-supported by insurance companies, financial groups, and things like that. So they had tons of money. They didn't have to get on the phone and beg for funds. So they could focus on their well-equipped boats, and just sail, and do the best they can. [Chuckles] Here's Mike Plant, has no money, working up to the last minute, things are not done, things are not finished. He's got to sail away with huge debts facing him, and he is alone, and he has pretty poor equipment by their standards. [Interviewer] Let me ask you first how you feel about your son going around the world alone in a boat. Are you confident that he can do it? [Frank] Oh, yes, I have absolute confidence in his ability. He has been doing so many things by himself, all his life. He has shown great ability. - So he is gonna win? - Come out alive. Come out alive or win? - Hopefully win. - [Mary] Both. [Interviewer] Mrs. Plant, what would you say that your son has, that makes him do this kind of thing? Michael has always done something that's had a big challenge to it, and I think this is, as he has called it, the ultimate challenge in his life, and I just have all the confidence in the world he is gonna do it and win. Have you ever tried to talk him out of it? Well, not really. I couldn't believe it three years ago when he told us this is what he was thinking of doing, and I thought, "August 30th, 1986 is a long ways away, times will change, he may change his mind." But here it is, almost the day they start the race, and I just... No, I didn't think I could ever talk him out of it. [Helen] The day of the start, it was just a mad scurry of everything at the dock, including all the other racers. There was no calm. None whatsoever. And I think Mike just thought, "Please get me out of here so I can relax at sea." [Frank] Seekers have to have some goal that's worth every ounce of their energy. And I am terribly happy that Mike had really found such a goal. [Mike] It was pretty exciting because, God, you know, here it was, finally starting. I was dead tired, I hadn't-- It felt like I hadn't slept in a month. This is when it dawned on me that things had really started, and we were on our way to Cape Town. [Jason] Goodbye, Michael, and good luck! Goodbye. Good luck! We won't see Mike Plant now until he arrives in Cape Town, South Africa. The fastest time to get there is about 47 days. That's gonna be at least six weeks before he gets there. Otherwise, he will be back in Newport, Rhode Island next spring, hopefully, the winner of this solo Round the World yacht race. Jason Davis, Channel 5, Eyewitness News, Newport, Rhode Island. [Captivating instrumental music playing] [Mike] That's very much a race. Very competitive. That's the way it should be. I'm all in favor of making it as competitive as it'll naturally get, yeah. I didn't build this boat just to get around. I've got almost three years' time and work and money into this project. If I wanted to get around, I'd do it in a 44-foot swan or something. [Reporter] Mike Plant took on an early lead as the 25 ocean greyhounds raced out of Newport on Saturday afternoon. His latest position puts him first in his class and fourth overall. At 36 degrees six minutes north, and 63 degrees 36 minutes west, he is 84,900 miles out into the Atlantic. The weather is bad. The threat of a full-blown hurricane has passed, but the fleet are in a tropical depression, and are beating against 30-knot headwinds. Mike got into a very interesting race with Jacques de Roux. Jacques de Roux was smart, he was very, very tough, very skilled and polished as a navigator. Nobody was playing the game as hard as those two guys. I think their bond was more of a competitive respect for one another, more than real friendship, per se. For Mike, that was probably more important, anyway. He didn't need a lot of friends. He was out there for the competition, not to make buddies. They were highly competitive with each other because they were 50-footers, first and second, first and second. [Reporter] Mike Plant told a radio operator on the East Coast that he was experiencing beautiful warm weather. He said he would be even closer to Cape Town if he hadn't made a tactical error late last week when he almost ran out of wind. "A mechanical problem with a sail-reaping system has been repaired using," Plant says, "sailing wire, chewing gum, and spit." [McCormick] First leg of the race, Jacques pretty much showed Mike his transom on the way down to South Africa. [Reporter] Mike Plant said his boat performed flawlessly, but he just couldn't catch up to take first-place honors. [Mike] I only got close to Jacques a couple of times, I think it was three times, three or four times I got within 70 or 100 miles of him. And it was only for a day. [Laughs] And then he was gone. And I mean, he just... God, he would just leave me. I go into a hole, and it would take me a day and a half, two days to get out, and he'd just be gone. And I'd catch back up to him, and same thing would happen. It happened three times. But... [interviewer] But going into the second leg, you got locked in heavier conditions. You're pretty confident. Your boat is very sturdy. - It's very solid. - Yeah. You got heavy stuff going on down there. - Yeah. - So... I'm not worried about the boat at all. [Man] So you figure you'll be in first in the next leg? [Mike] That's where I'd put my money. If I were a betting man, that's where I'd put my money. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah, we are gonna go like hell next time. [Giblin-Stark] In an unusual sort of way, I do think Mike and Jacques were like brothers. I do have a visual of the two of them sitting at a cookout, shortly before the restart in Cape Town, just the two of them talking quietly to each other. And I thought to myself, here are two guys who are arch competitors. And yet, I think they have a lot more to share than they do have something that divides them. [Interviewer] How was the race? All the way, I'm a very... From the minute we left Newport till the day we got here... [laughs] [reporter] Mike Plant says his boat will be even better on the next leg across the stormy Southern Ocean which stretches nearly 7,000 miles from Cape Town to Sydney, Australia. Survive the journey, you'll be in Sydney just before Christmas. [McCormick] What happened in the second leg of that race was truly tragic. Jacques de Roux left Cape Town, South Africa, bound for the second leg, which was in Sydney, Australia. Two weeks before it would have been the finish, and Jacques de Roux was missing. [McCormick] The boats all had tracking devices and all of a sudden, Jacques De Roux's boat started tracking erratically. [Martin] Jacques de Roux was lost. I think at that point, they didn't know what happened to him. Because they can watch him with the transponder, and watch the boat move, six, seven, eight, ten, twelve knots, and then suddenly slow down and do one knot, one and a half knots in the other direction. That is a nasty sign. It's very clear that something is seriously wrong. Jacques is not perfect. So I regret, this means that he probably fell off about a day and a half ago. It's our nearest guess. So that is the only information we have at the moment. [McCormick] They inspected the boat, there was a half-eaten sandwich down below. Something had happened that caused him to rush on deck without putting on his safety harness, without hooking on to the deck with a tether, and he went over the side. That's one of the greatest risks, you know, if you do fall over the side, there is nobody on that boat to come back and pick you up. [Mike] I am in first place now. First place in my class, it's only because of... the man who was ahead of me has disappeared, he was washed overboard, the day out of Sydney. It's very tragic. [Solemn instrumental music playing] [Helen] When Mike found out that Jacques de Roux was lost at sea, he was not going to come to Sydney. He was just going to continue sailing around the world. He finally did come in, and he was devastated and heartbroken. Yet I know he got through that because he knew Jacques de Roux would want him to. [Reporter] It means Mike Plant has lost his friend and his closest competitor. He was first in his class to arrive in Sydney, but he says it's a hollow victory. Of course, I was upset, and I had reverences for this man. I did not fear for Mike at all. People asked me, "Aren't you afraid?" And I said, "I'm not afraid." I couldn't let that fear take over my life. Was there a little bit of fear? Yes. But I believed he would be fine. [Reporter] More than halfway through the race and two legs to go. Mike Plant and his yacht, Airco Distributor, are running in sixth place overall, and first in their class. On Sunday afternoon at 3:00, Sydney time, they'll set out from Sydney Harbor for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This is the longest and the most dangerous leg, over 8,000 miles dodging icebergs and the treacherous Cape Horn. [McCormick] The hardest part of that trip was still ahead of him. He still had to round Cape Horn, he still had to go up the North Atlantic, he still had half the world to sail in front of him. This is really the reason these guys go down there. This is the point where you get tested as a sailor and a seaman. [Mike] As long as I can remember, I wanted to see the Southern Ocean and the 40-foot seas and the strong winds that dominate that part of the world. That was the real excitement to me, and the race was just the incentive to put it together. [McCormick] Once you get to 40 degrees south, you're in the infamous roaring forties, and then the screaming fifties. You're in the Southern Ocean. You are in a part of the world where the winds go unimpeded around the bottom of the planet. Tremendously wild and wicked seas. Not unusual to have 40 to 50 knots of winds, and 40-, 50-foot seas, when you get down there. [Mike] Got all the weather blowing straight off of the ice caps. Got the wind and the weather coming straight off of Antarctica. Nothing to break it down, nothing to warm it up. [Read] I can tell you, it ain't pretty sometimes. And it's not necessarily the wind that gets you, it's the waves. It's like getting on the highway and standing up on the roof of your car, and you're going 50 miles an hour, and it's pouring rain and freezing cold, and you got your T-shirt on, you know, and you're trying to stand on the hood of your car. Going over every big pothole you can imagine. So that's... Does that sound like fun to you? And I would ask him about it. And he'd kind of shrug it off, like, "It's what I do, it's really no big deal." Well, after being there, it's a big deal. And that's just the type of guy he was. He was like, "Nah, piece of cake, I got that." [McCormick] The farther south you go, the shorter distance you have to sail. The trick there is, the farther south you go, the more chance you have of an iceberg that's broken off and is coming off from Antarctica. You don't want to go so far that you encounter the ice, but you need to stay in the big heavy breeze, because that's where all your competitors are going to be. [Mike] We all had a period of three or four days where we had ice almost constantly in view. And for three or four days, you're literally at the edge of your chair. It's like driving your car at a hundred miles an hour with your eyes closed. It's that tense. [McCormick] Granddaddy of them all, of course, is Cape Horn, 56 degrees south. [Martin] That's the only place on Earth where the water goes around the world unimpeded. And if that has wind against it, or even without wind against it, wind behind it, it can produce seas that are 100 feet high, seas that will break ships in half. [Mike] I rounded the Horn at 12:00 noon exactly. And of course, the Horn, you know, it has this mystique about it, so you are gonna find edge, anyhow, because you're waiting for something wild to happen. It's quite an experience. It was so much wind, seventy knots of wind is enough, I found out, to haul the boat over. It was a real fight to get around. You really just push everything to the maximum, you just take it right to the limit. And in this case, it paid off. I made it through. It's pretty exciting because you're back in the south Atlantic Ocean, and you're headed north. It's a wonderful feeling. [Reporter] Mike Plant is running first in his class, and the last report was only 150 miles from Rio de Janerio. After resting there for a few weeks, they will set out again on the final leg to Newport, Rhode Island, and home. [Mike] I think everybody was real happy to get the race back underway. It was a pretty straightforward race, that last leg. Never had any periods of no air or light winds. Went right through. [Martin] It's an extraordinary thing to do. He'd never built a boat before. Here, he chooses a designer that could be a big mistake, he chooses a challenge that could be beyond him, and he built the boat, every part of it, every detail, he was intimately involved with. And then he tries to see if it will work. Takes it all the way around the world, and it works perfectly for him. [Jason] Mike Plant and his 50-foot yacht, Airco Distributor, is presently averaging over nine knots. At that speed, he should arrive in Newport, Rhode Island, on Thursday or Friday. First in their class, and the first American team to cross the finish line. [Mike] Well, my actual finish was on a Saturday. Middle of the day. Beautiful breeze. And because it was a Saturday, and because it was the first nice day of spring, everybody came out to see the boat finish. They made it absolutely the best day in my life. Mike! Whoo! [Reporter] What it proves is that there are people with a sense of adventure, and with enough belief in themselves to take the risks, to prove they can step out and take themselves a little further. I've been searching those things out all my whole life. [Helen] It wasn't the race, it was the adventure. Mike Plant loved adventure, and the challenge to himself. To say, "I did it. I did it." [All cheering] [indistinct chatter] [Martin] There was a mob to the dock. Everybody trying to get in close, give him a kiss, or shake his hand, or take his picture. It was wonderful. And Mike was really proud. [McCormick] Mike was psyched, you know. Mike had fulfilled his dream. He'd showed up in Newport, four years earlier and... you know, didn't have a boat, didn't have a program, didn't have any sponsorship, didn't have really a clue as to how any of this was going to unfold for him, and then four years later, he's come back and won the bloody race. Really, the first American ever to have any success in that kind of international arena and that discipline of sailing. I think that's when he knew that... that this was kind of his calling, this is what he wanted to do. I think he really legitimized himself at that point. He put himself on the map with that race, and that became the key to his ability to procure more sponsorship going forward. [McCormick] Despite what he'd gone through in Sydney, and despite what had happened to Jacques de Roux, it gave him the incentive to want to continue on and do what the French would do, and to take it to another level, which is exactly what he did. This race represents the dreams and desires of all sailors, to challenge themselves to the best of their abilities through the ultimate test of man and machine. I want to thank everyone who has helped me to win this race. Without their support, I wouldn't be here now. I hope to see everybody, all of you, in four years. I'll be back. [Audience applauding and cheering] [man] And finally, winner of Class I, and a $15,000 check, yet again, Philippe Jeantot, France, Credit Agricole III. [McCormick] Big five is still Class I. Jeantot was still the hero of that race, you know. The guy who finishes first in the big boat class, he is still the top dog, you know. He is still the alpha dog. [Helen] Mike wanted to go to sea to become one with himself, to really understand who Mike Plant was. And come to terms with some demons, and come to fruition with joyous things happening in his life. And that was a joy. [Martin] He was living in Jamestown, and I thought, well, this guy just raced around the world, you know, he's won his first prize, he's got some money for it, not enough to cover any of the costs. I thought, well, he'll be taking it easy. I went around to his house, and I couldn't find him. I looked around the back, and he is building a shed. He is a consummate builder. He has to be making something, and it's really what Mike's character was about. [Interviewer] That's Mike Plant, who is a world-class and championship yachtsman. So how much did you win by? I mean, what was the winning margin? [Mike] Four and a half days. [Interviewer] Are you gonna be back to defend? [Mike] Yeah, we have plans to build another boat, Class I boat. We want to build a 60-footer. [Interviewer] So you're gonna step up into what, Class I? [Mike] Yeah, exactly. And, well, we're gonna do a race before the next BOC. The next BOC is 1990. We are gonna do a race in 1989, which starts out at France, and is basically the same course, just a little bit different. This race out of France doesn't make any stops. It's around the world, nonstop. Terrific. I love it. The Globe Challenge, which, I think, is now called the Vendee Globe, is a nonstop single-handed race around the world. Round the Island race, and the island's Antarctica. [McCormick] The Vendee Globe was the brainchild of Philippe Jeantot. Jeantot decided that the ultimate challenge would be a nonstop race that began and finished in France. That you cannot stop, you cannot get assistance, and once again, taking something that had already been pretty extreme, and taking it to another level. That was it. That was the creme de la creme of all race. And he wanted to do it. [Reporter] For almost two years, Mike Plant scratched along, building his own boat on a shoestring. Donations dribbled in at a rate just sufficient to build a bare-bones boat that he hoped to sail around the world. [Interviewer] You could have taken the easy way out, you could have rested on your laurels and gone back to your building business. Got married, raise a couple of kids. Christ, I never thought of any of those things. No, this is... This is gonna be exciting. This is a great race. I just thought it was really important to be included in this first group of circumnavigators. It really is a first-time event. [Interviewer] Are you gonna win? [Mike] I've always thought my chances were pretty good. Mike Plant had little or no money when he decided to construct a boat and enter the race. However, with the help of some influential and very generous people in Minnesota, he did get his boat built. And now, he says, with the aid of some new sponsors that have just come onboard, he will make it to the start line in France on November the 26th. [Martin] Duracell was a perfect match. They had a board at the time that thought this would show independence of thinking, and durability, and that sort of thing. [Giblin-Stark] Duracell called me. We had a good chat. I told them a little bit about my background, and he said, "Well, Mike says you're the person." I worked very closely with the marketing and advertising people at Duracell. From the start, right through to the finish. This is a great moment, and to be able to share it with everyone who's here this morning makes it really, much more real. It's much more... much more real. [Giblin-Stark] The money that they invested perhaps was a relative drop in the bucket when you're looking at major corporations, major sponsorships, whether it's NASCAR or professional sports. But here you have this guy who sat at the table, who really was not polished or smooth, but he put his heart on the table and he said, "You need to believe in me, because I do believe in myself." [Phil] O' Lord and Neptune, bless this ship, and he who sails in her. Thanks thee to the designer and those who built her. May she run strong, blithely, swiftly, round the Southern Ocean and home again, a winner. - [Woman] Yeah! - [All cheering] [reporter] The dream has come true for 38-year-old Mike Plant. The race called the Globe Challenge, will begin on November the 4th at Les Sables d'Olonne, in the west of France. It'll end nearly six months later at the same place after circumnavigating the world. - Good luck, Mike. See you in France. - Thanks. - You're gonna do this. Great. - Yeah. [Reporter] Mike Plant will be sailing a bare-bones homemade boat in this race called the Globe Challenge. Because of that, he is considered the underdog at the start, but although he is competing against the world's finest long-distance yachtsmen, he's not a long shot. Last time he raced like this, he won his class. [Speaking French] [Giblin-Stark] It was nothing like we'd ever seen here. Just a crush of media from all over Europe, and all of these guys were heroes. They were celebrities. And Mike was right there with them. [Man] You have gone into debt, you have beaten your brains out for a year and a half. You're already-- You still owe many people money, I know that. That's a fact. And there's no prize money. People say to me, "Why does Mike Plant do it, then? Why does he risk his life to go around the world alone and take all that on too?" I wish people would quit asking me that. [Laughs] I still don't have an answer. [Helen] The atmosphere is purely electric. You can feel it vibrating, I mean, this is phenomenal. [Jason] Just by making it here to the starting line, these men have proved themselves to be the most resourceful, determined, and bravest of their kind. But the first one back here next March will earn the undisputed title, the finest solo sailor in the world. [Indistinct radio chatter] [McCormick] Mike was in the upper half of the fleet, but he wasn't challenging for the lead. His boat frankly wasn't quite as quick as some of the French rocket ships. He was playing with a more conservative weapon, but he was respectable, he was hanging in there. [Giblin-Stark] Mike and I didn't speak daily. He was very happy being on his own out there, so... he would talk if he had to. It was rare that he'd call in on the radio and just want to chat. It did happen occasionally. Here he was, thousands of miles away, but he was so stoic. You knew that if he called in or he shared something with you, he really must be suffering, or he must be in a bad way. [Mike] ...ten more good days. I really have been trying to punish everything more than normal. Not trying to break things, but... not... being overly cautious. [McCormick] When you're single-handed sailing, you've got to do everything. You've got to be the navigator, you've got to be the cook, you've got to be the mechanic, you've got to find some time to get rest. You got to be the forecaster, you got to be the weatherman. For Mike, that was really an appealing thing, that he didn't have to rely on anybody else. He had all these various disciplines that were rolled into this one pursuit. If he fucked up, it was because he fucked up, you know. And if he just succeeded, it's 'cause he succeeded. And there was no sort of middle ground there. [McCormick] Once in the Southern Ocean, Mike had a five-dollar rigging component fail, and he couldn't continue on where the rigging went slack. The mast was gonna go over the side. If the mast went over the side in the Southern Ocean, he was in deep, deep trouble. So he pulled into a little island called Campbell Island, which is off the south coast of New Zealand. Once he got in there, however, his boat started to drag anchor. I guess it was pretty windy in there and it was a little cold. It wasn't very protected, it wasn't really an anchorage. But there were a bunch of New Zealand meteorologists who had stationed down there, and they had a little inflatable Zodiac. They may well have known that Mike was dragging, and that if he continued to drag in this cold, he was gonna end up on the rocks, and if he ended up on the rocks, his boat was gonna break. [Man] Thought it was going to snap at you. Let's have some action. [Helen] They had touched the boat, so he was disqualified, according to the rules. And the weathermen said, "No, we will never, ever tell anybody." And Mike said, "I will." And that's when he called in to headquarters and said, "I have to disqualify myself." [Jason] Mike Plant was a boy in man's clothing. I don't think he ever lost that sense of adventure that he had on Lake Minnetonka. He wasn't there for the fun of it. He was there for the challenge. [Speaking French] [instrumental music playing] [Giblin-Stark] That was a very special moment when we heard from Mike that he was underway again, and he really was flying along. He wasn't gonna give up, even though he was behind, or he was an unofficial contender at that point. [Woman] Mike Plant andDuracell has finally hit the heavy weather, and Plant is ecstatic about it. Plant seemed almost giddy in a telex to the Duracell Globe Challenger office this morning, saying, "What a difference a few degrees of latitude will do for one's mind and soul, not to mention boat speed. I've made it to the corner, and we're rowing along tonight. Duracell is charged up, we've got 30 knots of wind on the beam, and we're just loving it." He was just driven. It's fantastic, you know. You can't have more than that in your life, I don't think. [Woman] Duracell Globe Challenge update that everybody has been waiting for. Mike Plant inDuracell sailed into Les Sables d'Olonne, having sailed around the world in 135 days, thus becoming the fastest American ever to do so. According to sources at Les Sables d'Olonne, thousands of people are lining the jetty leading to the harbor. [Helen] There were 50,000 people to greet him, coming in seventh, disqualified. I said, "All those people are here for you, because you are the hero. You are honest. They love you." [Cheering] [Martin] That was very glorious. He was appreciated here. He was a hero in France and in Europe. [Reporter] Top Gun on the background. Look out. Perfect. [McCormick] He was pure, and I think they recognized the purity of what he had achieved. Mike shows more by what he did in that race than what he didn't do. He didn't finish it as a competitor, but he finished it as a sailor. And I think that was the essence of Mike Plant. This race was very important to me. So the last couple of days have been really hard for me... because, obviously, I am DQ, which is disqualification, but the idea of just dropping the race in New Zealand, it was impossible for me to comprehend, and quite frankly, I never have. [Jason] Mike Plant is right now back in Rhode Island, and then in September, he does it all over again. Another sailboat race around the world. Jason Davis, Channel 5, Eyewitness News in the Twin Cities. [Announcer] For centuries, the sea has been a lure for men and their ships. In spite of the risks, the quest has been one of exploration, financial reward, and more recently, speed. ESPN is proud to present exclusive coverage of the 1990-1991 BOC Challenge. I knew that when Mike entered in 1991 with Duracell, I knew that he felt like there was some unfinished business with the Vendee Globe. But if you are competing at that level, it was pretty important to do the BOC Challenge, which was still a very, very big event in the US. It was gonna mean, if he did well, sponsorship dollars, and that he would probably be looking for a different boat to do another Vendee Globe. [McCormick] I think the 1991 BOC, for Mike, was... I think he felt obligated to do it more than had a passion to do it. Like any sport, if you've got to continue playing, you can't just sort of take a couple of years off and go sit on the sidelines. That was the next race in the calendar, so he had to go do that race. I think that his eye was on a different prize. His eye was on a new boat. Again, the French came to the party with wider, faster boats. We were all envious of that. We were really envious of the designs that we were seeing. And because the French had come to the party with more sponsorship dollars and probably better planned campaigns, they just dominated the sport. And Mike saw that, and he knew in order to compete at that level, he needed a really, really innovative great design. [Newscaster] The local Newport hero is Mike Plant. He broughtDuracell into fifth place, but overall, he's fourth. Mike built his boat in Newport, and is the leading American single-hander. We talk like, "Oh, it wasn't that big a deal." Mike was now on his third circumnavigation. No American sailor had ever done such a thing. So he was already in very verified company, but for Mike, that wasn't the important race. The important race for Mike was the next one. The next Vendee Globe. No, I would like one more... one more shot at this, I think I've... I've learned a lot in the last few years, and I'd like one more chance at one of these long races, maybe the Globe Challenge again. [Interviewer] What is it that keeps you going? What is it inside you that makes you wanna keep doing it? I mean, you could just sort of take it easy and float into the next one, and call it quits. [Mike] It's just something within you that keeps you from stopping. I can't explain it, but for me, and racing sailboats... Well, I don't do it any differently than anything. I am not a quitter. I don't... I never have... quit anything, and so... It's a tough question for me to answer because it's one I never ask myself. Hi, I'm Mike Plant. I have completed three round-the-world sailing races, and presently, I'm preparing to enter the 1992 Vendee Globe challenge. This will be my second attempt at winning this nonstop Round the World single-handed sailing race. [Black] Mike's greatest ambition was to win a race like the Vendee, and to beat the French, who were so far along ahead of him in this arena. [McCormick] He realized that he needed a different boat than what he'd had withDuracell. Duracell was a fairly conservative boat. The design for these Round the World boats had continued to evolve. The entire shape of the boats had changed. Instead of a sailboat with a full keel and a traditional sort of big slope, the boats now were these wide flat hulls with huge towering rigs, amazing amount of sail power. These boats would absolutely get up on plane and just haul the mail. The progenitor of this type of new hull was a guy called Jean-Marie Finot. He was the guru for all the French. All the top French sailors were sailing Finot boats. Finot was really at the top of the game and in many ways, he still is. Finot had won just about everything. But I thought amongst us all, there had been a strong American aspect to it. And I felt that we could design a boat that could race with the French. Mike, loyal to Rodger Martin, went back to Rodger to build his ultimate open 64 Vendee Globe, which was calledCoyote. [Helen] It was a really beautiful name. Most people don't know Mike Plant was spiritual. He would be more spiritual than Native Indians, than with "God," per se. "Coyote" is indicative of one that travels alone and eats sparingly. I said, "That's perfect." Coyote. The thing that is exciting about this boat is the performance advances that we've been able to get through, I think, through what we've learned in the last seven years since we've been involved in this. And this boat is about 7,000 pounds lighter than the last one, and it has twice the power to carry sail. It's definitely a different animal. We've learned a lot from ourselves, we've learned a lot from the French boats. And this new boat is really quite extreme. This machine was being created that was more powerful than probably any boat that had ever been built for this kind of racing. And you knew it was gonna fly. Even in the early stages of construction, when it started to take shape, it was evident that it was gonna be a weapon for him. This was unlike anything else Mike Plant had ever campaigned. The boat was built up in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, in a boatyard called Concordia. They'd never built a boat this high-tech before. They were builders of traditional cruising boats, and this was a whole new animal for the Concordia Boatyard. Having Concordia build Coyote was... They basically built the boat and loaned him the money to do it. And so then, he would owe them for life practically, to pay them back, you know. But it was just good to have a sponsor. It was somebody else's responsibility to do this. These guys were on a mission from God. They were gonna build this boat, then Mike was gonna go out and kick some French ass with it, you know? [Interviewer] If you had to give Mike any advice about how he sails this boat, from just the way you think she's gonna feel, what bit of advice would you give to him? One thing. Hang on tight. [Interviewer laughs] [Mike] Today is the 10th of September, 1992, and we have finally launched the new 60-footCoyote. It has taken about eight months, close to 12,000 man-hours. The idea, of course, is to go to France in four weeks to prepare for the 1992-93 Vendee Globe race, which is an around-the-world nonstop adventure race. There will be 18 boats. This will be the only American boat. I sailed with Mike on late September. He had to be in Les Sables d'Olonne by October 30th. It was one of his first sea trials, and it was at the very end of September. So he already was really pressed up against it for time, but he went out on a classic Newport day. It was a beautiful fall day. A northwesterly breeze, the cold front had gone through the night before, so we had a big northerly breeze, and we got out in the Narragansett Bay, and put the kite up, andCoyote just... absolutely a little rocket ship. She just was as smooth and fast as can be. We were just sort of rocketing out towards Point Judith, making double-digit boat speeds, and just everybody on the boat was amazed. It was just cleaving through the waves. This is a boat that was capable of 20, 22, 24 knots, speeds you normally see in a powerboat, especially with a towering rig. [Read] Coyote, no pun intended, completely different animal. The minute we went sailing on that thing, everybody's like, "Whoa, what's going on?" It's a design that has never been tested before, so you never know until the thing is in the water, sails up, power on. And the boat's moving, and you're steering it, and it's alive, and... You really don't know what you have until then, so it's really exciting. The single-handed Round the World race today, would... I'm guessing, be a two to four-million-dollar project for the guys at the top of the game. Mike tried to do it on a half a million at the time. He probably needed three-quarters of a million or a million dollars to do it right. I mean, you don't have the money, that means you don't have the time. And that's the resource that you can't replace with a race start coming up against you. [Mike] Tom, there's only two weeks before I have to take the boat to France, so we've only got two weeks left to do the things that are left to do. We only have sailed the boat for a week. We are a little bit behind schedule in that regard, so there's a lot of things left to do. [McCormick] The boat was very, very late coming out of the shed. Boats had to be in Les Sables d'Olonne on October 30th. Mike was still in Annapolis. And the reason he was there was he was trying one last ditch to find some money. He didn't have that big sponsor. He only called the boat "Coyote" because it was like a placeholder name. And whatever the name of that corporate sponsor was would replace it. [Black] We got into the Chesapeake Bay. And the Chesapeake is a very shallow place. We were traversing the bay, getting over towards the eastern shore. I remember it quite clearly because I was on the helm. I wasn't taking pictures during this exercise, but I was steering so that everybody else could do the tuning of the rig. And the boat just came to a halt. Whoa. You feel that? You feel that? Did we just pick something up? [McCormick] We ran into a sandbar, apparently, and the boat got pretty stuck. Okay, well... we'll do that. But we'll get back to you, okay? [Man] Yeah, just switch them in the back. Don't go into the computer. Yeah, roger. Okay. Stand by. [McCormick] There's only couple of different ways you can pull a sailboat off. One of which is, you know, if you take the halyard, which is one of the lines of the masthead, and you run into a power mode, and you just yank the thing. Hang on. Yeah, blood everywhere. [McCormick] We got a passing powerboat and they were able to, with a couple of different tries, you know, yank that boat out of the mud. Slippery gums. I gotta go tape up. [Black] And that became the controversial moment. I guess carbon fiber doesn't like to go like this. It's really strong this way, but it doesn't like to twist. [McCormick] Especially with that keel, if that had been in some way damaged or misaligned, or was not right... That was never double-checked at that time. You can drive your Honda over the curb and drive away with it. You can't drive a Formula One car over the curb. It'll break. [Mike] Everything on this boat is a one-off, which means it's been customized for this particular boat. And so it really ends up needing a little bit of adjustment once you see the thing in actual use. So that's what we're doing today, and tomorrow, for the next ten days, and then... I am out of here to France, and... we'll see what happens over there. [Davis] You never knew with Mike because he didn't start bellowing and tearing his hair out, "I'm not ready, I'm not ready, I'm not ready." He would just plod on and internalize all this, and he would sail away and there would be things wrong, and things not finished. And nobody knew, except the people that were closest to him. And they knew his character, so they're not gonna make a big issue of it. And I am sure this is true when he left New York on Coyote. I'd read reports that he was nowhere near ready. Nowhere near ready. And the pressure must be enormous. You are not ready, you don't have enough money, and you've got to get across the Atlantic to qualify for the race. He was very conscious of... of his responsibility to the people who helped him. And I think he would never give up on that. He would never say, "Thanks for your help, but I really didn't feel like it." He said, "I have to do this." "I have to do this." "Yes, you have to do it". So... I am very excited also. Very, very exciting to see Mike finally on the boat, in the water, sailing. And he is very happy. It's a beautiful boat. And there is no fear. I don't have any fear. It's not one of the emotions that I experience. Distancing is something I experience pre-race, which is ongoing usually. And that's just something that needs to be done so that Mike can do his race, and I can carry on with my life. And it's all a little difficult sometimes. But... And I always have tears of joy when he leaves. It's... I know that the fulfilling part for him is to get out there and be on the ocean. It's wonderful. [Man] Mike set off from New York early in October, on his way to do his transatlantic voyage. It was the first time he ever sailed that boat by himself. [Black] It was his first moments of actually solo-sailingCoyote. And I thought for an instant, "These are important pictures." You know, "I don't wanna miss this, because there's a lot of unknowns that could happen." The whole sequence of crazy events that unfolded in the weeks after Mike left New York, several days into the trip... He was able to patch a call through to Helen, through a passing freighter. But he wasn't able to talk directly to Helen, but by VHF radio, he was able to talk to the skipper of a freighter who was then in turn, able to talk to Helen, so he was kind of an intermediary. I could hear him on the radio talking to the radio guy, telling them that he had electrical problems, but that he would be okay. "And tell her that I love her." So that was it. Then there was nothing. We had nothing. That was the last I heard from him. [McCormick] Several weeks later, some friends here in Newport got a hold of the rescue communication centers in the United States and Canada, and asked, "Please go back through your records. Have you heard signals from EPIRB?" Which are satellite transponders that sailors set off when they are in trouble. A couple of weeks earlier they had, in fact, had three bursts from an unspecified EPIRB, and they had not acted upon it for two reasons. First being that EPIRB already made three bursts, and they said at four bursts, it's an actual distress signal. And they also didn't have that particular EPIRB registered. There was no record of who owned it, what boat it might be on. [Newscaster] But Mike Plant's family and friends say more could be done. To urge the Coast Guard to ask the Navy's assistance in finding our son Mike, who sent out an emergency signal from his sailboat on October 27th, and the coast guard did not act on it until November 13th, just last Friday. Never said boo to anybody and those are... That's, to me, a very serious, serious situation, when they ignore a cry for help. The question is, why wasn't the search for Mike Plant begun when his emergency beacon, one just like this, first went off on October the 27th? The coast guard said that Plant never registered his beacon, therefore they had no idea who to go and look for. Phil Harder is a member of the family and an experienced seaman. What do you say to the coast guard on that? Well, to put it politely, that's just nonsense. The only thing encoding does is say the name of the vessel and the owner, and the country of origin of that vessel. But the alarm flare, if you wanna call it that, on a radar sweep or the equivalent, is the same, whether it's encoded or not. A powerful storm in the Atlantic Ocean may have doomed a veteran American sailor trying a solo crossing to France. Jacqueline Adams has that story. [Female newscaster] After a fierce hurricane, a satellite picked up a signal that Plant was in dire trouble. But no one knew it was him, since he'd apparently never registered his emergency signal with authorities. Almost two weeks after he should have landed in France, the coast guard finally identified Plant's distress signal, and a massive search began. Navy and coast guard planes scouring 190,000 square miles of ocean. They were hoping by the 21st, the 22nd was the start, his birthday was the 21st. And then right after that, the boat was spotted upside down. In other news, the coast guard has called off its search for the American yachtsman, Mike Plant, who was trying to sail alone from New York to France. Last Sunday, a freighter spotted his 60-foot yacht upside down, north of the Azores. A French tug reached it today. An emergency life raft, partially inflated, was still onboard. No sign of Plant. The coast guard says he is presumed to be dead. [Female newscaster] Divers did a thorough search of the hull of the 60-foot slip, theCoyote. They did not find Mike Plant. What they did find seems to indicate the seasoned sailor has not survived. Mike Plant's family and sailing friends say they think that on October 27th, the weight on the bottom of the boat's keel came off, and that the sailboat went over immediately. Anyone that has any notion of the ocean knows that if you are missing for weeks, the chances of you being alive are very slender. I really... I... I thought for sure he would show up. I really thought for sure. I just couldn't believe the boat was upside down and he's nowhere. There's always the hope, but I think the realist... The realist in all of us knew that this was a really bad sign. I'll have that upside-down picture with no keel on it ingrained in my head for the rest of my life. [Helen] It floated all the way across the Atlantic, in three months, upside down. I wanted to get the keel to see what happened. [McCormick] There was a lot of speculation that when that keel bulb dropped, when it fell off, that it had been a very violent motion, that perhaps Mike was immediately tossed into the sea, crashed on deck, that he had, you know, a quick and painless, and merciful end. I think everybody was wondering what happened to that bulb, that's really the central question to everything. Did Mike run into a container, did he get backed off? Did he hit a whale? Was it just a poor mechanical bond, was it poorly installed? Was it that grounding in the Chesapeake Bay? What happened to that fucking keel? [Neri] Looking back on it, compared to the amount of science and computer modeling and engineering, and material science that would go into attaching a bulb to a keel today, it's not an indictment on anybody's efforts. It's just a statement of the lack of funding for the projects. I mean, that part of the job should have gone to a structural engineer. You know, literally, months before the guys in Concordia got to that stage of the build project. But it was done with the best intentions of some very good people, and with the best advice of a very experienced person. And they were the wrong choices. Would it have, you know, been okay, intact, although it hadn't grounded? But there's nobody who can tell that. It's a possibility. No one really knows exactly what happened other than the fact that, that boat was gone, and that boat was flipped. But why that happened, that's the big question. I remember during conversations people kept saying, "Isn't it great Mike died doing what he loves?" Nobody dies doing what they love. He died pushing a boat hard, and all of a sudden, even for Superman, even for Mike Plant, ran into a spot that he couldn't get himself out of. If it had happened in the Southern Ocean around Cape Horn, I think you could say, Mike died doing what he loved. The great tragedy of Mike isn't necessarily that he was lost at sea, but that he was lost at sea, so close to try to prove and achieve what he'd spent most of his adult life after. I think he probably scrambled up on top of that hull. I think he probably survived and held on as long as he could, hoping that somebody would come. But they never did. Never did. [Wever Weed] So who needs someone who races around the world in sailboats and then goes and gets himself lost at sea? All the greatness and fray, the disturbance in our lives, who needs it? Who needs someone who stirs up our routine so often? Challenging our sensibilities, inspiring us to believe we can achieve the impossible. Who needs it? Who needs someone who never settles for good enough? Whose expectations of himself elevate those expectations we have of ourselves? Never arguing for limitations. Constantly focused. Reaching, searching, who needs it? Who needs someone who is more interested in living than in longevity? Who needs a searcher who reminds us how little we have found? I do. I will never forget Mike. He would like people to see that it is okay to go and follow your dreams, and get through your adversities, and live the adventure. Every avenue around us is built on fear, I think. That can give you an avenue to say, "All right, it's over. I am not going to be fearful. I am going to live. I am going to take a risk, I am going to love, but I am going to be me." I think what many people don't realize is that their dream is actually already there for them to take advantage of. You have to see that what you're doing isn't getting you where you want to go in life. People should take the dream that they're given. I mean, the love of things that they see when they're open and enthusiastic and go with it. There's no other way to get moments of satisfaction. Mike Plant saw it when he was three months old, probably. I think about it, a lot. You know, as a young boy, and I think about him and all the things that he wanted to do and did do. I think that's what this is maybe all about, that if you got a goal, you can do it. The chief inspiration, indeed, with all of us is to... If you set your heart on something, you can accomplish it. A psychiatrist said about him when he was young, "It's a pity of some that were born a hundred years too late, there's no frontier left." People ask why I do this stuff. It's... It would be really easy to... explain it today, wouldn't it? It's gorgeous out here. It's been so long. Two years. We're almost as far north as the rays go south. We're almost to 50 degrees north. And it really looks a lot the same. The ocean is such an incredible color. It's so deep blue, it's just like... how it was two years ago in the south Atlantic. You can't believe it's the same ocean that's off of New York City. We're only about 700 miles away. Bird life is better and better every day. This is the first truly... good day I've had. It's kind of tough getting used to being at sea again. It's been almost two years for me. Physically, the first couple of days were really tough. I wasn't really seasick, but it's tough to get anything done. It's just all so different. But feels a lot better today. Last night was no wind, very sloppy. The seas are still really confused, but this breeze now is so fresh. It's gonna string things up quickly. I just hope it stays. It's supposed to have a front with 35 knots from the southeast, which would be... On the nose, it's supposed to happen tonight. And I really don't need that. This is real nice, the way it is. Knot meter is reading 12 to 13. Winds are 21 up current, it's about 25 through. This boat is moving along just nice. Real nice. This may not seem that fast, but it's faster than the 12-meter ever goes in its whole life. Jason, buddy, you got to see it. You just gotta see it. It's too bad we gotta rush for this... qualifier...
