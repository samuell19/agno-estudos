The doctor is sad, he doesn’t want to be with people like us... But your skin, dear Sir, is no more worth than ours! If you don’t waste your powers and die first, you'll see me die with satisfaction. Stop, Peter, we would have drowned like everyone else when the ship went down, if the lieutenant hadn’t taken the chains from us. Are you grateful for that? You idiot. If we can save ourselves, the first what your Lieutenant de Ross will do is our journey to prison! This is my duty and I would do it. Hey! We are moving! We have a current ...it must be hot. The fog is getting stronger. Guys! You can’t see anything! What was that? That must be a log. In that case, we are close to land! There are many scary legends about this sea. They say there are huge octopus which can also pull ships down to the bottom of the sea! Hey! Something’s rushing to the boat! What's going on? Help! This is a curse! Get down, get down! - Help! - Take it easy! Don’t lose your head or we’ll all end up in the sea! Hold on, take cover! Help! Antoine! No! No, José! Stop! Don't drink! Don't drink! This is toxic water! Or you will be perished! Maybe we’ll find good water in the woods. Let’s go! I can't make it. Come on! Lieutenant! - José! - Francois! Come on, give me a hand. Peter and Skip found water. It's only a few minutes away. A whole lake is waiting for you. Our skin is dirtier than I thought. Is something wrong, Lieutenant? That’s enough! That's enough I said! You want to burst your guts? I'll get something to eat. There must be an animal somewhere. Francois, wait! Where are you going? Are you afraid he won’t come back? Hey, Lieutenant! Now that your weapon is on the ocean floor, you can stop giving orders. Francois, keep the knife. You can’t kill anyone with the reeds. Let’s go! Francois! Francois! He can't be far. Let’s go look there! Hey! Check this out. My God! It looks like he was eaten by a caiman. A caiman wouldn’t rip a man apart like that. And what animal could that have been? What is it? We’re on a volcanic island. Let’s see if anyone lives here. Wait! Looked like a horse. ...a Horse? ...too much sun, lieutenant? No it was a horse! Do you believe me now? Lieutenant! Take my hand! Why Skip and not him? Let him die too. He is a cop! Okay. Take your foot away. You’re breaking my arm. At least give him the kill shot. You son of a bitch! Come on, Lieutenant, come on! Let’s go! If there is a trap, someone must have planted it there. Get out of here! It is a cemetery. Stop... What are you afraid of, José? Come on, come on. Looks like this place is used for magical rituals What kind of strange... There are no bodies in these graves. Don’t touch the leaves. These are voodoo symbols. Voodoo...?! Yes. This island is cursed. This is the devil’s land. It is said that Zombies live on this island. Living Dead. That's why the graves are without bodies! There are Zombies here! Stop it Jose! Don’t say that to me! Zombies don’t exist, they never existed. Thanks! Don't move! Who are you? We were stranded with a boat a few days ago. A strange current drove us to the coast of of this island and... ...now we are here. What's this island called, ma'am? It has no name. It’s not on any cards either. It belongs to Edmund Rackham, and I don’t think he appreciates your presence. For your sake, I suggest you return to the beach and find a way to leave. I beg you! We are so exhausted, and hungry. Show us where we can find food and shelter. I can’t show you anything. You have to help yourself. Quick, let’s follow her! I told you not to come near me! You're worse than a snake! Leave me alone. I was commanded to serve you to stand by you and take care of you if necessary. Are you supposed to be spying on me, Shakira? Edmund always knows what you’re doing, I don't have to tell you that. I don’t understand how they got this far. Lieutenant, listen to me We gotta go! No, José! There’s something very strange about this island. What happened to the other two at the cemetery the appearance of this woman... And even if we wanted to, how can we go back? You landed on my island without permission. Who are you? Lieutenant Claude de Ross Medical officer on the French schooner Cayenne sunk a week ago. Ah, you are a doctor...? And these two Gentleman? The Cayenne was transporting convicts. Only we survived when we reached the island. Yes, well... ...the nature of this island is not very hospitable to strangers. Follow him, he shows you where you can stay for the moment. Look! Another curse! The scorpion is a holy beast! He is the guardian of the souls of the living dead. Nonsense, he is alone. This is a poisonous animal. No! You can't do that. Come on, José, you were brave enough to cut an old woman's throat without blinking. Why are you so upset about a scorpion? We will all pay for your actions. You have cursed us! Leave! You knew they’d follow you, didn’t you, my dear? That was very unwise. I hope you know that. You know you’re not supposed to do this without asking me? Do you understand? And I don’t want you to come in here without my permission. I just wanted to make sure you weren't late for dinner. Why? Why? I thought I'd invite the young lieutenant tonight for dinner. The poor man deserves something after what happened to him. Don’t you think he’s a very interesting man? He is young... Once washed and cleaned, I think he should speak to you... After all, the island does not offer much variety... ... for a young woman, isn’t it? Why not interrupting this boring life from time to time. You are a creep. If I can’t have your love let me at least have the sweet agony of jealousy. To say the truth... You'd like to have him as a lover... don't you? Get out! Get out! Okay. I wish you were particularly charming today, my love. You'll be the last beauty the young man will see in his life. I’m curious about this strange cemetery. The graves are empty. What about the bodies? The answer is simple: Years ago there was a volcanic eruption and the natives left the island They thought the volcano would destroy everything. But before they left they cast their dead into the sea. That's a stupid superstition. But I noticed recently that there are signs of black magic. So someone takes this stupid superstition serious. Perhaps Shakira can can say more to that. She is coming from Haiti. The land of Voodoo... ...but if I were you lieutenant ... wouldn’t be so curious. People looking for something they don’t want. I don't get it. What don’t you understand? Lot of things... ...this island and you both who live so far away from civilization. I don't know what's so attractive about this place. I find that very unusual. In your opinion, your so-called civilized world is more attractive? Honestly, I don't regret it. A ship supplies us twice a year with everything we need and that's all we need. Isn’t that right, my dear? You're a doctor, aren’t you, Lieutenant? So I'm sure you know the term... Misanthropy? Well... I wouldn't call it that. Yeah, I kill my people, but I hate most of all that they’re trying to force their rules on me. And here on this island... I am the absolute ruler. Yes, I am convinced of that. Maybe I put it wrong in my diagnosis of your strange maybe I should have said paranoia. You're my guest, Lieutenant. But I want to remind you that you can be thrown back into the sea. Sure you can but you will not... at least not yet. You’ve been missing an audience for far too long. Touché! I apologize, but sometimes I'm exaggerating a little. You are indeed right. Nice to have you also for my wife... Isn’t that right, Amanda? Yes, I'm very pleased. These noises happen often. But we're used to it. That's just the internal pressure of the volcano, but I'm very calm. I'd be worried if this stopped. I see. But you said the islanders had to leave the island. I think you shouldn’t feel so safe in the activity of the volcano. Don’t tell me you’re afraid a man of your experience. Or are you in search for a reason to leave us? Did you hear Amanda? It seems our guest doesn't appreciate the beauty of our island. Amanda? Didn't you hear me? I’m sorry, I was distracted. I just said that Dr. de Ross seems impatient to leave us. And why would he stay? Excuse me. I'm a little tired. This climate makes her nervous sometimes. You have to understand her. Please proceed without us. We'll talk about your departure tomorrow. I'm sorry I haven’t a more comfortable sleeping place for you for you and your travel companions. I... See... I see death. I see death. Stop. Let me... No! Good morning Doctor! What can I do for you? Peter just went missing. Do you have any idea where he might be? He could have escaped. That was to be expected. I don’t think Peter had that intention. If it reassures you, no one can escape the island without me wanting to, you know that. So where is he?! What did you do to him?! Who, me? Nothing... I wouldn’t worry, he was... actually he is... a criminal... And he should end up the way he deserves! Listen, Rackham. It is not your job to determine the lives of others! If you did something to him... Calm down. Now listen to me. I decide everything that happens on this island I am the law. You should be careful. And now go away. You stay here. Why should I? I'm not a maid of you, Edmund I do what I want! You be careful, Amanda. My tolerance is not boundless. José, stop, José! Let him go, Doctor, he won't get far. And neither will you if you follow him. José, stop! José! José! José! José! José! Stop. Where is he? He is a fool. He doesn’t know this forest. He won’t make it through. Look. If you really want to help me, come with me. I have to find José. It makes no sense. There’s nothing more he can do. Neither do you. What do you mean? Why? What power does Rackham have? What is he doing on this island? What are you hiding? Claude, do as I say, follow the sun as you reach the coast on the other side of the volcano build a raft and let carry yourselves by the current about 100 miles south you will reach an inhabited island. It's your only chance. Why don’t you come with me? Don’t you want to escape from this island too? I have no choice. I have to stay. What are you afraid of? Why don’t you let me help you? Let me go! No! You can still go! Get out of my way! Leave me... Rackham! Yesterday I was attacked in the forest by a monstrous animal who tried to kill me. What happened, Edmund? You can tell him everything. She saved my life. I saved his life? What are you talking about, Lieutenant? Probably the overnight stay in the cave is the reason for the doctor’s nightmares. Nightmares have no claws! There was a creature in the swamp and that one attacked me. You’re talking bullshit, Claude. Sure. Must be the fever. The tropical climate. Listen, Rackham, I want to know what's going on, what’s hiding on this island. Stop it, Claude, stop it! You really are crazy. Amanda, wait! No, Amanda! Let me go! Get the fuck off me! Please calm down doctor, with violence you will get any further. Besides, my men are stronger than you. Okay. Okay. I'm insane. I'm a crazy visionary. I am having nightmares. Tell them to put their hands off me. Come on! Let’s get him in! Professor... can you hear me? You are still alive because this man needs medical help. Come on, hurry up, do something! Okay. I need more light, clean water, bandages and an iron. He got many infections and the infection is spreading. They must be cleaned and treated. You get everything you need but keep him alive! And? Tell me. It's a very rare tropical infection. If he doesn’t leave this climate as soon as possible and doesn’t get to a hospital where he can be treated... Doctor... ...how long does he have to live? If he stays, there’s not much time. A week, maybe a month. That’s enough. This will have to do. So keep up the work, Doktor. Rackham! I won’t do anything if you don’t tell me who this man is and why he’s being held here. His name is Marvin. Professor Ernest Marvin and he is not a prisoner. Ernest Marvin? The biologist? I thought he is dead a long time ago! Well, as you can see, he is not. And he must stay alive as long as possible. The longer he lives, the higher your chances of surviving, Doctor. Your father had another crisis, but he’s already recovered. Claude took care of it. He seems like a good doctor That’s what I needed. That's why he’s safe for now. Anyway, I think it's better if you don’t see him anymore. You talk too much, my dear! I want to see him! Your father is in good hands. You won’t leave this room. Stop it! Stop this! Please! Don't let her out. Ernest Marvin. Studies on biological mutations. Who's there? Who is it? How did you get in? I’m your attending Doctor. You had an attack earlier, remember? No... What are you doing? Stay down! Anyway, save yourself the trouble. I have no hope. No, I can save you! But you need to get out of here, you need a special treatment in a hospital. I can’t go, my work is still not done, my work is not finished! Which work? What do you need to finish? Tell me! I have to go now... Save your energy, professor. You're a very good doctor with an admirable quality. But I would prefer if you would limit your attention to purely medical issues. Would you come with me, please? Come on! This island is completely tunneled, from one coast to another. A real maze. It's incredible. But time and many evolutionary processes have made this happen Volcanic lava and coral reefs surround it. Its geological structure remained intact. Come on, come on! After you. Don’t worry, you have nothing to worry about. This island was the highest point from a continent which has sunk. My God, what is that?! You have the privilege of seeing a sunken city of the continent Atlantis. Look! Look at this, doctor! All you see is what is left of your ideals of a great civilization. The temple of the sun god. There, 500 meters deep and locked. A huge treasure of immeasurable value! 500 meters! But nobody reaches such a depth! No human, of course. When I came to this island, 15 years ago, I asked Professor Marvin for help. Someone who can get in contact with them. Do you understand know who attacked you in the forest? These creatures are the only ones who can salvage this treasure! The descendants of the old inhabitants of Atlantis! Half fish, half human! How did they survive? How did they develop? They survived because they have developed. Marvin believes that this is the Triumph of the Continent. Thousands of years ago, the human race of this time became amphibious. They are more fish than humans, that wouldn’t last long on land. Fortunately, the professor found a way to curb their cruelty. He gives them a potion and they obey him. What kind of potion? If I knew I would not need the Professor any more... ...and neither you, Doctor! It's a chemical, a drug... something that makes the fishmen docile. And they recover the treasure. I didn’t know a scientist could be so greedy. No, Marvin is not greedy. I convinced him that the gold of Atlantis is destined for research and humanity. I can understand that a scientist is willing to give his life for a find of this size. But you don’t care about science, do you? You are only interested in the buried treasure! And I bet you won't use it for any research. Yes, you got it right. I'll keep everything for myself. You think that’s immoral? You do your thing well Doctor, I need to show you something more interesting What is this...? ...is your wife involved? Does she know what you’re up to? Amanda is the daughter of the professor and she’s not my wife. At least... ... not yet. She is so sensitive. She cannot bear the thought, that something unpleasant can happen to her father. Yes! You are blackmailing her by threatening to kill the professor. That's right, my friend. I see you have your escape option if you have the treasure. Of course! And when the professor dies before he served his purpose? Well... that is my problem! Look. When I brought the professor here Amanda was still very young. Her father taught her over time to communicate with the creatures. She brings them the potion and that's why these monsters trust her. They obey her, they do nothing to her. You are afraid that if her father dies, she will refuse to continue working for you. That saves me explanations! But if you use your talent and keep the old man alive then I would... I would be willing to share some of it with you. What do you think? Acceptable? Why not? I see death... Destruction. The statue of the sun god. He will rise from the deep! The island will be destroyed! It will sink into the fire! Everything... ...everything will die. Shakira! Shakira! Shakira! Edmund... ...it was terrible. Let’s get out of here before it's too late! Please, I'm begging you! Man comes out of the water and in the water he finds the biological components of its survival. The respiratory system is the result of an initiated adjustment from his ancestors who left the seas to move to earth, but man can reclaim land. The original amphibious status. Ernest Marvin. Now I remember... He was the convicted geneticist for his experiments the transplantation of organs from animals to humans. Amanda. Amanda! Claude! I am so sorry. I had to pretend before Rackham like I couldn’t! I know everything now! I may know more than you. Come on, let's go and see your father The door is locked and there are guards. Let’s try from the outside! But he is not here! How did he get up?! I think I know where he is. How do you open this door? I don’t know, my father never let anybody into his laboratory. Not even me. He’s in there preparing the potion for the sea monsters? Yeah, but what you call monsters were creatures like us thousands of years ago. Ah, yes, the legendary inhabitants of Atlantis! You know your father was expelled from the medical board 20 years ago? Yeah, just before he got here. I was still very young and he said he had an unfair trial. Unfair? You don’t know what he was accused of! No, I don’t know. He never wanted to tell me. He was accused of killing some patients. On which he carried out unusual, genetic experiments. Amanda! I think Rackham and your father have deceived you! Professor! Professor Marvin! Father! Oh my God! It is José! It is José! Look at him! Here are your descendants of Atlantis! The experiments of a madman! That's where the islanders went! They have all become such monsters! That can’t be, Claude, impossible. My father couldn’t have done this! No! What did he do?! The end result of 20 years of my work! This was the first being with a true intelligence! You're not a scientist, you're a crazy, a cynical criminal, ruthless! Father, how could you invent such a monster? What? What monster? Amanda, what you call a monster is actually the solution of one of humanity’s greatest problems. One day, in a not distant future, when earth no longer possesses diverse human races there will be a new race. A race of amphibians which can go to the oceans which can use the vast riches of the sea to survive... Do you now recognize the social significance of my work and all the stupidity of what he did? They would never have the final result of their experimentation. You wouldn’t have lived long enough. My own existence doesn't matter. My work will be continued by others. Your work will die with you, Professor. Rackham needs his creatures only for the gold of Atlantis. And when he does, he’ll destroy everything. He doesn’t care about the future of humanity. In fact, my personal future is of more importance. There will be no future ...for all of you! Coward! Father! Father. Now it's your turn, Doctor. I have a better idea. Let's see if Marvin's theory will apply to you. Let me go! You can’t give orders, Amanda! Your father was murdered! Claude will follow him soon! Witch! Damn you, damn you! Wait Shakira! I'm your wife, don't forget Edmund! Amanda belongs to this island and she must die, too, now that this island is dying. You are insane, Shakira! Remember the prophecy, Edmund! The sun god will rise from the deep and the great volcano will destroy the island. We have to go now! Sure, but Amanda’s coming with us. No! I'm sorry, but we also need the body of your father! Your creator is dead! And I can control you! Now you must obey me! I want the treasure of the sun god! I said it all! And now fast! Do as I say or I'll kill her! The god of the sun! You must find him and kill him. Where is he now? To where did he take Amanda?! In the big cave. The island could explode at any moment. Get out of here! I'm not going with you! Damn! - Amanda! - Claude! We don't stand a chance. Yes, we do! Come with me, quickly! Let’s go! This way leads by boat to the cave. We'll get down with the rope! Come on! They didn't get the potion the last two days! I can’t control them anymore! We have no choice. Amanda, yes! Come on! Help me lighten the anchor! Jump in the water or I'll kill her! Do it, damn you! No, Claude, don't do it! You think I wouldn’t do that? Jump! Amanda! Amanda! Claude. Amanda! We are saved! We're out of this nightmare. But... ...how is that possible? It was them... They were trying to save us... You think... ...that these creatures are dying? I don't know... Maybe... Water is their element now. Maybe the dream of my Father will be true one day. Look! Hey! Hey!
