And you can?t even remember why you fell in love in the flrst place, rlght? Well, obvlously, you can remember that now or you wouldn?t be dolng thls. Oh... ...go ahead and blow yourself up if you want. You?re sure gonna be mlsslng a lot. Do you have any klds? Mlckey and mlkey. How old are they? 31/4 and 5. If you?re gone, who?s gonna see they graduate hlgh school? How you gonna flnd out whether they found a nlce glrl? Huh? - Whether mlkey?s stutter cleared up? - Mlkey doesn?t stutter! No, but let?s just say that he dld. There?s so much... there?s so many... ...so many ilttle thlngs that we don?t even notlce untll they?re gone. Can mlckey rlde a blke? Don?t you wanna teach hlm?

You may thlnk you know hlm, but... ...i bet you don?t even know who hls teacher is. Or the names of the monsters in hls room. Or why he burled hls shoes that tlme... ...or why he made you call hlm peter for a whole month. You know, you just take thlngs ilke that for granted. Then one day there?s a stranger standlng in the door, saylng: Can i borrow the car keys, dad? You don?t know how it got that way. You don?t even know what you?re dolng there. God! Lt?s gone then. Once it?s gone, you can?t get it back... ...no matter how hard you try. No one should klll hlmself. Don?t you do that. Oh, l?ve been so stupld! (applause) (cheering) - Thank you. - Ok, pal.

He?s a blrd-eatlng splder. - Blrd-eatlng? - Except he doesn?t really eat blrds. - No? He eats mlce and bugs. But he can klll blrds if he has to. You know, if they get too close to hls hole where he ilves. Because it?s so hot, they ilve in holes. It?s cooler underground, and safer whlle they?re sleeplng. - You know a lot about bugs, huh? - Yeah. I dldn?t know that. But baseball?s stlll my favourlte. Then dlnosaurs, and then bugs. Hey, dad, you gotta see thls! Isn?t he cool? Oh, yeah! Wow! Scary! Huh? Yeah. Blrd-eatlng splder. They ilve in holes. Rlght? Dad? Can we do it agaln next week? - We?ll see. - Ok.

Oh, burt... the guy says to hlm, ??well, what are tornadoes for? ?? and the prlest says: ??well, they?re god?s answer to traller parks! ?? what! Never mlnd! - I guess you heard about tucker? - No. Got blown away thls afternoon. He pulls thls guy over for maklng an illegal rlght... ...and blam! He takes two rounds in the chest! - They id the guy? - Yeah. Carl stark. Boss of those guys you put in hospltal. Man, that guy is an evil son of a bltch. Stark. Shlt, l?m gettlng hungry. Wanna get somethlng to eat? What? - When dld i last buy you dlnner? - A couple of weeks ago? No, you got the plzzas on monday. Exactly! (~ chopin nocturne) Are you outta your mlnd? - That jacket is you, pal! - Thanks. I just wanna buy you a ilttle dlnner. Dlnner?s a plzza, burt, or a cheeseburger. Not lobster thermldor. Ernle, you were best man at my weddlng. You?re godfather to my son. We?ve been partners for ten years. Can?t i just once spend more than three lousy dollars buylng you dlnner?

The keys to hls new convertlble. What the hell?s wrong wlth hlm? - And today is hls last day on the force? - Mm-hm. I really don?t thlnk you need to worry very much. He sald he loved me! Many offlcers on the polnt of retlrement experlence contradlctory feellngs. Some relate to immlnent loss of power. Others to a fear of maklng it alone outslde the close camaraderle of the force. No, you don?t understand. Burt?s not ilke thls. Not at all. Thls is ilke drlvlng around wlth a completely dlfferent guy. I suppose it?s posslble he?s sufferlng from some form of manlc depresslon. Well, how can we flnd out? Lt?s actually a chemlcal imbalance. It would show up on a blood test. - Good mornlng. - Good mornlng. - Mornlng. - Mornlng. - How about a ilttle break? - Gee, thanks a lot!
