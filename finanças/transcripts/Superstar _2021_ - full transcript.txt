[TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] Queen! [WOMAN] It's true what they say. Your life does flash before your eyes. [WISTFUL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN] Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to be an actor. - For my parents, - [APPLAUSE] my church, my school, you name it! If there was a play, I was there. But my parents wanted me to study Law, that there was no future in acting. - I already gained admission, dad. - What?! I'm going. You will not get one naira. One shishi from us until you study Law. [WOMAN] They were true to their word. I studied Theatre Arts... [IN PIDGIN] Something is going on at the market! [WOMAN] And managed to go through it without their help. [IN PIDGIN] Your husband is sleeping around with market women. [WOMAN] After Youth Service, I came to Lagos to make it in Nollywood. Girl, it was harder than I thought! Why can't they run a better system? I mean, why is it so nonsense?! We're struggling to enter so they know anything they give us, we'll take. - First time? - [HISSES] Yeah. Just to play, [IN PIDGIN] "I showed up." [SCOFFS][IN PIDGIN] That's how the Nollywood hustle is. - I'm Queen. - Cynthia. - [LAUGHS] Nice to meet you. - [LAUGHS] Nice to meet you. - [IN PIDGIN] It'll work out some day. - [IN PIDGIN] We'll make it! - Uh-huh! - [CYNTHIA] That's life...

Why are you wasting your talent? Don't you want to be a director? [LAUGHS] Well, yeah, I'm saving for my short film. Every kobo counts. Let me guess. You're here to offer me a role in your short film? No. But only because the only female role in the film would be a waste of your talent. Sure. Uh, I think you'd do great at this. - [UPBEAT MUSIC] - [MUMBLING] Twenty million naira? - Mm-hmm. - And a brand new car and... Yup! - Thank you. - [WOMAN] AD!

Are you the next Genevieve? [LAUGHS, MOUTHS INAUDIBLY] You know, Muna, the star of the show, was also said to be the next Genevieve. Yes, sir. She's very good, sir. She's so good, it's amazing to watch. - [DOOR LOCKS] - [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] Of course, she is. I am the best talent-picker in all of Nollywood. I remember when I first laid eyes on Muna. I said to myself, "That girl is gonna be a superstar." And look at her now. Adored by fans everywhere. All because of me. Do you want to be a superstar, Queen? [GULPS LOUDLY] Yes. Yes, sir. - Yes, you do. - Yes, sir. I can see it in those beautiful eyes of yours. - But Queen... - Sir? Are you ready to do what she did? Are you ready to play the game? - [SOFTLY] Jesus! - Wait, wait. Sir... I don't understand, sir. - Queen. - Sir? Talent is only five percent of the work.

I'm looking for a star. Do you know who I am? No, sir. I'm Babs Akindele. The biggest talent agent in Africa. I'm only interested in making stars. Do you have what it takes to be a star? I don't know, sir. [BABS] You don't... Why are you here wasting my time? I'm not wasting your time, sir. I'm here because I have no choice. I've been chasing this acting dream since I was a child. I've acted every single chance that I've gotten. Acting estranged me from my parents. My boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend. I lost my job. I've done bad things. All because of acting. Maybe I'm even bad at it. After all, I have... I have nothing to show for it. The one time that I thought I had a chance to make it, I was wrong. So no, sir. I do not know that I'm a star but one thing I do know is that I am an actor. So even if you chase me out of here, I would not stop trying to make it. [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBS, LAUGHS] Wow. I didn't even realize that until just now. So thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your time. I like her. Me too. I think she definitely has what it takes. - Mr. Producer. - Yes.

[QUEEN CHUCKLES] - You're very kind to say. - I'm not gassing you, really. You're like Beyoncé. No last name required. [QUEEN CHUCKLES] You're not doing bad yourself. I mean, look at you. I hear your show is the most popular in Nigeria. And we're gunning for Africa. After all, we can't all be actors. - I wish you were. You're amazing. - [TOLANI] You're too kind. Well, this show is called, True Talk. And what we have here is candid conversations. So, let's start with the critics who have been complaining that you've allowed yourself to be cast these sexy-girl roles. Do you maybe think that they have been unfair or that maybe you're more than just a sex appeal? Tolani, I'm grateful for every role I get as an actor. And I do believe that it is my responsibility as an actor to give 100% to whatever role I'm given so, yeah. Of course. The question is the type of roles. Are you afraid to go for more challenging roles? Do you think that you might not be good enough? Um, like I said, I'm grateful. Of course, I'm very grateful for my audience. - Those watching at home. - [TOLANI] Mm-hmm. Um, and I'm also grateful for their responses to my performances. Yes I am. I, being a member of that audience, we're grateful for your work as well. - [FAKE LAUGH] - [TOLANI LAUGHS] So, what do you do in your free time when you're not making "those movies"? Free time? What's that? [LAUGHS] I don't have any free time, darling. I... I'm always working. Work, work, work. I love my job. My job is my life. Ah, surely, there should be time for love. I wish. [LAUGHS] Do you? Word in the industry is that the embarrassment and betrayal that you've experienced has turned you off men. Turned me off men? [LAUGHS] What?! Of course I hope to find love someday. It's just... [SIGHS] it's not a priority right now. I have too much work. Find love with a man? [SNORTS, CHUCKLES] Is that a joke? As opposed to...? Okay. There are rumors going around that, how do I put this? Your ex cheated because you had other interests. [TOLANI] Watch the video. [MUTED DIALOGUE] That's not what it looks like! This interview is over! - What the hell is this ambush? - It's 2021, Teni. Queen has already accomplished so much. Think of what could happen if she came out as a gay icon. Fuck you, Tolani! Queen, let's go. - Toodle! - [TENI] Bitch! Until next time with Tolani Talker. Mwah! [GIGGLES] Cut! [BABS] Did I not do everything that I promised? Huh? Our arrangement is simple. You follow my lead, I make you a star. I did! The movies Tolani is dragging me for, you made me make them. I'm carrying all of this for you! [BABS] Those movies made you a star! You know what doesn't make you a star? Videos of you kissing girls. I didn't even know that video existed! I didn't even know. And you! How the fuck did you let this happen? Well, Teni said it was you asked her to set up the interview. I'm really sorry, Babs. I, I didn't see it coming. It's your job to see it coming. Okay now, I'm here fielding calls from brands threatening to drop her. I don't even understand. Why is this anger directed towards us? She ambushed us. It should be directed towards Tolani. She is your client! You! Take your princess home. Come up with a list of eligible B-list celebrities and have her pick one. Tomorrow we announce her new boyfriend. What boy...? Hell, no! Babs, I said, "No!" - [TOLANI] Let's ask... - [QUEEN] Nobody... [QUEEN] Babs. Babs! [QUEEN] How dare he speak to me like that?! [CHUCKLES] What's funny? That's the way he speaks to everybody. Just not to you cause you're a star. - Well, it doesn't make it right. - Focus, Queen. We have a problem. Are you gay? And it's okay if you are. It's just that... I'm not gay. Okay, good. No, it's not like that. It's just... Well, you know how our people are. All your work. What's wrong? Is it the boyfriend thing? - I don't think it's going to be that bad. - I know who made the video. So why didn't you say something? Because I want to deal with this myself. Okay. Take all the time you need. [SLOW SAD MUSIC PLAYS] Ah! Look who came to see your old friends. Let's just get this over with. [LAUGHS] Look who came visiting. Queen, the superstar in my house. What do you want, Delarin? - She said, 'What do I want?" - What do you want? I want to let you make amends. Make amends? You want me to make amends. You were my boyfriend. You cheated on me. And you! You were my best friend. I loved you both. But you betrayed me. Not only did you betray me, you also leaked that video of our acting exercise to disgrace me, right? And do you have any idea what you did to us? Hmm? After you announced on National TV that I fucked your boyfriend? Your fans trolled me for years. Queen, I had to leave social media. You destroyed my life. - Fair enough. I'm sorry. - Oh, fuck you! I don't need your fucking pity. Oh, fine then! You hate me. You hate me. Fine! But Cynthia, how could you be a party to this? [CYNTHIA AND DELARIN LAUGH] She said you're a party to this. A party to what? - It was all my baby's idea. - [CYNTHIA] Mm-hmm. - You're so bad. [LAUGHS] - [CYNTHIA LAUGHS] How do I know you're not bluffing? We both know that I'm not bluffing. That's the only reason you're here. But you see, a part of you is hoping that somehow miraculously, I do not have the footage. - Should I show her? - Mm-hmm. [LAUGHS] I'll show you. - Look at it. - [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Look at it. [DELARIN] Ah, let's go baby! [LAUGHS] Thank you so much, baby. [DELARIN] You do your own stunts, baby. - [DELARIN] Do that drift, baby. - Right. Okay. Got it. - I'm ready. - [DELARIN] You got this, baby. Come on! - I got you on camera. - [QUEEN] Yeah, babe. [DELARIN] Let's go, baby. [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] - [TIRES SCREECH] - [MAN SCREAMS] - Oh my God! - [DELARIN] Oh, shit! - Is he okay? Is he okay? - [DELARIN] Look at you! [DELARIN] What do you mean, "Is he okay?" like... [DELARIN] Yo! Looks like he's dead. - Is he dead? - [DELARIN] You killed him, babe. - Ah, you killed him, man. What did you do? - [QUEEN] Oh my God! [DELARIN] Now I will send that to your mama, and the whole fucking world if you do not answer our demands. You get that? What demands? [DELARIN] The demands are simple. We become a team. Just like before. - You must be dreaming. - [CYNTHIA] Why? Hmm? We supported you. Covered for you. - Took you to auditions. - Auditions. Gave you money for transport. Why shouldn't we reap where we sowed, huh? There's no way I'm letting you two back into my life. [DELARIN] I promise you, my darling. You don't have a choice. We... we're your new management team. And look, we're entitled to, what, 25, 30? - Thirty percent. - Thirty? Thirty percent of everything you earn, my darling. Managers only get ten percent. Uh-uh. - We're special. - We're special. - Cynthia, I can fight you! - [CYNTHIA GASPS IN MOCK SURPRISE] [QUEEN] You get nothing! You get nothing if you post and ruin my career. So you're going to give everything up? Hmm? The hair, you know, the outfits, the shoes? You're going to blow up your life? Queen, please! Please, don't make me laugh! You're exactly the kind of bitch we used to laugh at back in the day. I won't be surprised if you're fucking men for money. Huh, Queen? Do you spread your legs for politicians? - Huh? - [DELARIN] Ladies, can we not fight? Can we not fight? Queen. Listen, don't fight this, okay? Give us what we want and everybody would be happy. I mean, I'll be happy, she'll be happy, you'll be happy. Everyone wins at the end of the day. Hmm? I'll call you in the morning. And then we can discuss details. [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] - What is it? - [BABS] What the fuck is this? I know it's surprising, okay, but it is what it is. I wasn't talking to you. Talk to me. You were supposed to get a boyfriend, not a manager. Um, sorry but who says I cannot be both? Shut up, gold digger! I'm talking to my client. Listen, she's my client too, okay? You're her agent. I am her manager. Right? Am I to assume he planted the story? Yes, Babs. [BABS] Queen. You don't have to do this. We can fight. I understand. But I want Delarin and Cynthia to be my managers. It's my way of thanking them for their support. Whatever! You! Manager is not enough. You cheated, you need to get back together. Full reconciliation. [CYNTHIA] Wait, wait, wait! What do you mean, "You're dating"? It's nothing, please. Nothing. It's absolutely nothing. Come on! Come on now, it's just so that we can get what we need. [QUEEN] He's using you, Cynthia. He agreed to "date me" without even blinking. [SPLUTTERING] You know, you're actually really terrible at this. Oh, whatever! I know you love him, Cynthia, but he doesn't love you. He'll betray you, can't you see? - You think I'll take advice from you? - Exactly. The destruction of your career. The online abuse. I did not mean for any of this to happen. But it happened. Okay? But I guess we're even now. Mark my words, you will live to regret this. Exactly. Go to your room, man. Go read a script or something. Jealousy! Babe listen, it's you. - Listen hey, listen. Shh, shh. - No, no, no. Listen to me. It is you that I love. Okay? It is me and you.

What are you guys doing here? Can you go change so we can get out? Great job. [DELARIN SNIFFS] [MOBILE PHONE PINGS] [MOBILE PHONE PINGS] What's funny? [DELARIN] It's you I'm talking to. I said, "What's funny?" Gimme that phone! - Delarin please, give me my phone! - Hey, hey, hey! You see, you're so thirsty, it's actually pathetic. It's disgusting! Let me tell you something right now. You better not let people in the industry know you're fucking this guy. Okay? You don't want them thinking or knowing you're a whore. Yes. A slut. Rubbish! Wait.

Well, I knew something was up when I saw that selfie. I was like, "You went to Showcase Cinema?" And what's wrong with Showcase Cinema? Uh, it's boring. A guy took me there once on a date, trying to impress me with culture. I was not impressed. - Well, I loved the film. - [LAUGHS] Of course you did. Yeah, I know what you're about to say but... - I can handle Delarin. - [SCOFFS] Please! The only handling that boy needs is a good beating. - I'm even irritated talking about him. - [LAUGHS] - Come on, let's talk premiere and media. - [LAUGHS] So we have about three different photo shoots this weekend for four different publications...

So I didn't want to make a big deal. But guess who was seen having an amazing time at dinner? You guessed right! Queen and Hassani. And it's very understandable, you know. Based on how that useless Delarin has been treating her. Besides, Hassani is a visionary film maker. And he's handsome too. [CHUCKLES] But Sister Queen, drop that useless Delarin! Get rid of the deadweight. [TOLANI] And this cheating has a very bad reflection on you. You understand what I'm saying? Let's see some home training, please. So, let me know in the comments section who you think Queen will be taking to the premiere of her new movie. That ashawo, Delarin, or dashing Hassani. Until next time! [DELARIN] Did I not tell you not to be seen with that fucking nigger? Did I not tell you not to be seen with that fucking nigger? Are you dumb? - Hey, I will fucking cut you in the face! - [TENI] Delaring, are you crazy?! Do you want to kill her? - [QUEEN GRUNTS, GASPS] - [TENI YELPS] [DELARIN] Queen, are you...? [QUEEN SCREAMS] Hey, leave me alone! I said, "Leave my hand!" [QUEEN AND TENI GRUNT] - [TENI] You bastard! - [DELARIN] Queen! - [TENI SHRIEKS] Queen, no! - [DELARIN YELPS] - [TENI GASPS] - [QUEEN PANTS] - You stupid bitch! I swear to God... - Get the fuck out of my house! I never wanna see you again. If I see, I swear to God, I will kill you in your sleep. Are you mad?! It's over for you. I swear. It's over for you. - [QUEEN] You're dead... You are dead! - [DELARIN] I promise you, you're dead. - You're dead. - You think you can actually touch me? You can lay your fingers on me? Are you mad?! [TENI] Hello. We need you in the main house. You're dead. It's over for you, bitch. - Shut the fuck up! Fuck you! - [DELARIN GRUNTS] Fuck you! Queen, you're dead, I swear. Aw, man. You're dead, bitch! I swear, I'll kill you in this Lagos. [DELARIN] Ah! [TIRES SCREECH] [DELARIN] What... what have you...? Aw, shit! - [QUEEN] Oh my God! - [DELARIN] Look at you! - What do you mean, "Is he okay"? - Oh my God. - [QUEEN] What have I done? - [DELARIN] Looks like he's dead. [DELARIN] You killed him, babe. What were you guys doing? It was for a role. The actor was supposed to be able to execute a perfect hairpin turn. - What?! - [QUEEN] Yeah. The director wanted a shot of the actor's face while... while it's being done and... - What?! - [QUEEN] Yeah. We thought the road was deserted. - Who was he? - We don't know. I mean, we dropped him off at the hospital anonymously. We went back a few days later to try to get some information but they wouldn't tell us anything. And we were too scared to ask any questions. - It was an accident. - Yeah. Of course. [SOBS, LAUGHS] It was an accident. That's what I told myself for years. I didn't mean it. There's nothing I could have done. I even started to believe it myself. Not until Delarin came back into my life, and I realized that... that I've been lying to myself. I guess I'm a damn good actor. Right? I put up with his shit because it felt like I deserved to be punished for what I did. I mean, if I couldn't confess, then I should suffer. You don't deserve to suffer, Queen. - You don't. - [QUEEN] Teni... Put yourself in his family's shoes. Imagine that it was your father who didn't come home that night. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] I must do what I should have done years ago. - [SIGHS] I must confess. - No. - I must. - No, don't do that. At least, not without some preparation. - Don't do that. - Teni... [TENI] Mm-mm. We have the premiere tomorrow. We do that. One last night of freedom. And then we'll talk to Babs and roll out a plan of action on Monday. You saw Delarin. You know how he can be. What if he leaks the video before we do? Before we confess? [TENI] You're not any worse off. Look, it doesn't make a difference, trust me. Let's go to the premiere. And you take Hassani. Yeah. What's one last night of freedom without your crush? - [SOFTLY] Come here. - [QUEEN SOBS SOFTLY] ["AGNES" BY KAREN HAPPUCH PLAYING] ♪ Oh she lived her life ♪ ♪ Like she didn't mind ♪ ♪ She knew she would be alright ♪ ♪ Where she found herself ♪ [IN IGBO] ♪ Hope you're going, Agnes ♪ [IN IGBO] ♪ Hope you have arrived, Agnes ♪ [BABS] How could you be so fucking stupid?!

Let's get this over with. - Get what? - Hit me! Punch me! Do whatever you want. Let's just get this over with. [WOMAN2] Queen Ejiro, you have a visitor. [HASSANI] Yes! [QUEEN WHISPERS EXCITEDLY] Hassani! - [WARDEN] Hey, no hugging. - [QUEEN] Yes! So... It's so good to see you. It's good to see you too. How's your head? I'll be fine. Tried for days to see you but they wouldn't let me. - What changed? - [BABS] What do you think? Babs? Wow, I... I'm surprised to see you here. Now, is that any way to greet your savior? What are you talking about? The attorney-general has declined to prosecute. - What?! - [BABS] Yeah. Why? I guess no one wants to be responsible for sending Nigeria's sweetheart to jail for something that was obviously an accident. I killed that man. And you're getting away with it. Congratulations. - [BABS CHUCKLES] - But I... No, um, Babs wait. - I, I, I don't understand. - [HASSANI] Your fans. They rallied. Yeah. #FreeQueen has been trending since you got imprisoned. I guess they figured you were unjustly targeted? Babs will claim credit but it was all you. Okay? You, and your fans who love you. [QUEEN] But why am I not being punished? I don't understand. Why am I just being released? This doesn't make any sense. [WARDEN] I said, no touching. Hey. Listen to me. Going to prison won't bring him back. Okay? All you have to do now is to make amends with the second chance you've been given. That's all you have. Okay? [WHIMPERS] [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing? I was reading but watching you sleep was more interesting. [LAUGHS] What book is that? Hey! I love this book. Yeah. Sometimes, I feel like Abike. Trapped in the prison of money. Unable to get out, no matter how hard I try. Yeah, I get it. Ten years ago, you'd have made an amazing Abike. - Are you saying I'm old, Mr. Ghadi? - [CHUCKLES] Well, uh... How can I put this? Abike is a seedling. You on the other hand, are a rose in full bloom. Smooth. [CHUCKLING] Always. - [LAUGHS] - [CHUCKLES] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [QUEEN] Would you help me? Teni, would you become my manager? I really need someone in my corner. [TENI CHUCKLES] [CHILDREN] Mommy! Mama! - Hey, guys! - [MAN] You mean, girls. [TENI] It's okay, it's okay. I want you to meet them. Sit. So, um, this is Queen and Hassani. - [QUEEN] Hi. - Hi. Queen and Hassani, this is my husband, Emeka. It's nice to meet you, Queen. I've heard so much about you. And I've heard nothing about you. [TENI CHUCKLES] You have a husband? And kids? Why didn't you tell me? I thought we were friends. We are. It's just that Babs had a strict policy about home being home. But still, you should have said something. You're right. I should have. But you wanna meet my kids? - Of course! Hi! - [TENI CHUCKLES] [QUEEN] Hello! Oh, so precious. [BABS] What is she doing here? She's my manager. Queen, you don't need a manager. And if you must get one, at least get one that's competent. She is my manager. [SIGHS] Let's talk contract renewal. You want her to sign a five-year contract? Are you serious? What?! Too much? Okay. No worries. We'll make it four. Three. Fine! As long as she commits to doing one film of my choice every year. I don't want you guys screwing with my investment with these nonsense films that you're going to be doing. [MOUTHS] Fine. That's okay. Fine. We'll look through the rest of the contract and let you know. Of course you will. Oh, I'm going to be suing Delarin on your behalf for blackmail and extortion. Is that necessary? The guy is an asshole. - He nearly ruined your career. - You mean, your investment. Exactly. Oh, about that thing, it's been sorted out for tomorrow. Thank you. Teni, maybe I shouldn't have fired you. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [QUEEN] I know nothing I say or do will be able to bring back your husband. However, I'm really sorry from the bottom of my heart. I should have found you earlier. I just... Please. Forgive me. [IN PIDGIN] I should forgive you? Huh, I should forgive you? I will never forgive you. I ask you, what did my husband do to you to make you kill him? Was he the only one on the road? It was a mistake. [WOMAN] Do whatever you can and leave. Do whatever you can. Then leave. I need the money. I will take it. If my husband were alive, he'd have covered his kid's education. I totally understand your stance. Um... I've decided to... to set up a scholarship for your children's education through university. This is a check of ten million naira... for your use. And please ma'am, please. This is not me trying to buy my way into your forgiveness or convince you otherwise. This is just for your use. [WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLES] You killed my husband four years ago. It's only now you're begging for forgiveness? Even if you give us more than this, could it bring back my husband? Or could it bring back these children's father? I'm sorry, ma. You all should leave. In closing, I'd like to address the story that has social media, in fact, all of social media abuzz. The story of a murder. And with me in the studio to discuss this serious event is Delarin Awolowo. Welcome, Delarin. Thank you for having me, Tolani. Of course. Yourself and Queen have been in the news recently a lot. How do you feel about that? I feel horrible. Queen is suing me. Accusing me of blackmail. Are you saying it's not true? She hired me to help her cover her crimes. I eventually got tired and I decided to do the right thing. And then, she sues me for revenge. [TOLANI] So let me get this straight. You're telling me that Queen is using her fame and her money to silence and attack hardworking people like you? Exactly. But what about those who say you deserve it because you cheated? Let me ask you a question, Tolani. Can you cheat in a fake relationship? Yes, I am ashamed to say it but I... I was depressed. And people do silly things when they're depressed. - [DELARIN SIGHS] - True. That's true. And thank you for being this candid, Delarin. This crime that Queen has committed is no laughing matter. We're talking about murder here, people. Murder! And it just means so much to me cause online I see everyone trending the #FreeQueen. You're doing that thinking you're doing the right thing? But really, you have to stop! You can't evade justice and go scot-free because you're a celebrity. [IN PIDGIN] Hey, let me say it this way. Queen has used her own hand to commit evil. And people say we should let you go. In life, if she doesn't face the consequences, the equation is not balanced. There! Tolani Talker signing off until next time. Thank you. - Thank you for having me. - Anytime. Do you wanna have drinks later, or something?

[LAUGHS] - Thank you. - Excellent. Please. - Hey, big sis! - Hey! Oh! Well, how are you? - I'm so happy that whole thing blew over. - Yeah, I know. - How've you been? - Been good. - So you guys know each other? - [QUEEN] Of course! Muna is my big sis. We go way back. She's always shown me love and support. I mean, we have to support our upcoming talent. Or else, we won't be able to create magic. Great. And have you met Frank Okafor, our set producer? Of course she has. Queen and I go way back. Isn't that right, Queen? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS] - Yes, we do. - [FRANK] As a matter of fact, I'm the reason why Queen is who she is today. I gave her her first big break. - [MUNA] Oh! - [DIRECTOR] Amazing. - [DIRECTOR] Finally back together. Great. - [MUNA LAUGHS] - [CONSISTENT RINGING SOUND] - [MUFFLED CONVERSATION IN BACKGROUND] - [RINGING SOUND CONTINUES] - [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] [DIRECTOR] Queen! - Yeah. - [RINGING SOUND STOPS] It's your line. Oh, I'm sorry. - What page? - [ORE] Page 77. [QUEEN] Okay. Sorry. [QUEEN CLEARS THROAT] - Apologies, please. - It's there. "I need my sanity intact please. I wouldn't trade that for anything." [CRAZY LAUGHTER] [CRAZY LAUGHTER TURNS HYSTERICAL] [QUEEN] Sorry, that's just crazy. Because... [CLEARS THROAT] Esther is actually braver than I am. She's right. I shouldn't trade my sanity for anything. Or anyone. This man right here. Mr. Frank Okafor or whatever they call you. - This man sexually assaulted me. - [FRANKS MAKES STARTLED COUGH] Oh, you can cough all you want. You can even choke and die for all I care. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I... I cannot be on a production he's on. Excuse me. [FRANK CLEARS THROAT] Frank? [MUNA] Even her? Even her, Frank? Have you no shame? Have you no shame?! Have you no shame?! Don't you have any shame? [TOLANI] In the age of #MeToo, one would never shame a woman. But we do have to question the decisions of Queen Ejiro. Why do these things always happen to her? Why is she being the one who is constantly being assaulted, attacked and preyed upon? I'll tell you why. Because she's constantly making bad decisions. Yeah, Queen. Just take a look at yourself! Why always you? With me in the studio today, I have Frank Okafor. - Welcome, Frank! - Good afternoon, Tolani. - Thank you for having me. - Of course. And for those of you who do not know, Frank Okafor is a celebrated producer that was tarred with a brush of sexual harassment by the infamous "Queen." I'm telling you, it was the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my entire life. I can imagine. - Do you mind telling us what happened? - Sure. I remember like it was yesterday. I innocently invited Queen into my office to congratulate her on her performance. And it was a very nice performance. And all of a sudden, she was all over me. She was just saying, "Take me, daddy!" I immediately pulled her off me. I told her to get out of my office. Rubbish! I would not support that kind of behavior. No matter how talented you are. - It's a terrible example. Nonsense! - Yes. I also heard that Muna attacked you after Queen's outburst. Yes! Well, you know how Muna and Queen are very close. And the other three women who came out to accuse you, they're also sleeping with Queen? [IN SOFT VOICE] This is not what we talked about. What are you doing? [TOLANI] Whilst I'll acknowledge that Queen instigated your nonsense, you are a disgusting man, - and deserve everything coming your way. - What is it with this woman? - [TOLANI] I hope you never work again. - Why does she have it in for you so bad? - [TOLANI] Now, get off my show. - Did you kill her mother? - [TOLANI] Carry on! - Ask me! You know, since she came second runner-up in that Next Movie Star,... - she's just hated me for no reason. - [TOLANI] Goodbye! In her mind, I have the career that she wants. - [TOLANI] Next episode of the... - I mean everybody knows, don't... we would be inviting the beautiful Muna... - What? - You don't know? Uh, know what? You didn't watch the show? Come on, no. I don't watch reality shows. Not my thing. Hassani! It was you who asked me to apply. Yeah, because I thought it was your thing. [LAUGHS] You owe me! A lot! Go away! If you like, cough from now till next year. - [QUEEN LAUGHS] - [LAUGHS THEN COUGHS] [COUGHING] Should I get you water? [COUGHING] Sorry! Babe. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Blood! [NURSE 1] So when is her next dose? [NURSE 2] It's tomorrow. Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. [NURSE1] Um, okay. Well... Have you found it? Yeah, this is what I was talking about. - Yeah, exactly. - Okay. - [NURSE 2] First time I checked, I did... - Sorry, excuse me! Excuse me. Hi. - Sorry, we've been waiting for you. - [TENI] I'll call you back. Um, I, I just want to know, is there any information about Hassani Ghadi? - [NURSE 1] Please who are you? - I'm his girlfriend. Oh! Our visiting hours are over. - Please check to see. - [NURSE 2] She's Queen! - [QUEEN] What are they saying? - [NURSE 2] She's a celebrity. [NURSE1] Oh! I'm so sorry, Miss Ejiro, Mr. Ghadi is in ward 15. Just use the hallway. We agreed that you would call me if it got worse. Yeah, I uh... I've been tired but I just thought it was regular production stuff, you know. - It's Nollywood. We're always tired. - [DOCTOR] Mr. Ghadi. - I'm sorry. - Hey. I was wondering where you were. - How are you? - Good. Tell me everything. I got diagnosed, about a year ago. - Cancer? - Yeah. I don't understand. How do you have cancer? Um, then the doctors... the doctors said I have about three months to live. Now, they're saying I have, - I have one month but I know I have more. - [SOBBING] What?! - [SOBBING] - Hey, babe. I'm sorry. I should have told you but... People in my condition can't want things. But I wanted you so bad, I was afraid to lose you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. You're not losing me. I'm not losing you. No! Yeah, they say... The doctors say that the cancer has spread through most of my organs, so... So what? So we're just going to accept and not fight? I refuse! Okay, Hassani? We will fight this. - We have to fight! - I wish I could. I really wish I could. [CRYING] [SOBBING] Hassani, I just found you. This is not fair. See... Not fair. Every moment that I have spent with you has been a precious gift. I just wish we had more time. - We just have to accept what we had was... - We can't. No! I can't accept that. I refuse! You can't ask me to just sit back and, watch you die. Never! - [CRYING] - How can I...? I'm sorry you even thought it, you know. - I'd never ask you to do that. - That's not a big deal. Hassani, that's not what I mean. I love you. And we'll fight this together. We have to fight this. Please. Goodbye, Queen. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] What do you mean, "Goodbye"? Hassani? Please take her away. And she's not to visit again. Hassani. Hassani, please don't do this. Hassani, please don't do this. Hassani, look at me. Babe. Baby. Look at me! Hassani. Hassani! [NURSE 1] Sorry, Miss Ejiro, you'll have to come with me. Hey. What's happening? I can't. [SOBS] - What happened? - Babe, it's just sad. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] Queen! [CLICK SOUND] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - [MOUTHS INAUDIBLY] - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES] [GASPING] Are you fucking crazy? Are you trying to kill yourself? It hurts, Teni. It hurts so fucking much. All the time. [PANTS] Go to him. Go on. Get out of here. Thank you. I love you. I love you too. [NURSE 1] Ma'am, I'm very sorry but he was very clear. [QUEEN] The love of my life is dying. And he is keeping me away. He thinks he's protecting me but... I'm stronger than he thinks. Do you really never want to see me again? I mean, I thought you were only trying to protect me. That you thought I wasn't strong enough, but... If you really do not want to ever see me again, I'll go. Queen, you are strong enough. Babe, you're the strongest woman I know. I'm the one who is not strong. I didn't think I was going to be brave enough. I'm scared. I want... I shouldn't, I... I was... I didn't... It's okay. It's okay. It's all okay. I'm strong enough for both of us. Okay? You don't have to be strong for me. I'm strong for us. [WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'll just sit. Can I ask for a favor? Yeah, sure. Ask me to marry you. Ask me to be your wife, Hassani. I will ask but... [LAUGHS] I want tradition. - Queen... - I want this. Hassani. I want this. Honestly. Please. Queen Ejiro, make me the happiest man in the world. The happiest man alive. Will you be my wife? Yes! Yes, Hassani. Forever. Yes. - Well, at least for three weeks. [LAUGHS] - [LAUGHS] I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

Queen Ejiro. - [APPLAUSE] - [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [QUEEN LAUGHS] Oh wow! Thank you. [LAUGHING] My gosh! I... I didn't think I'd win. I mean... All the other nominees in this category are so amazing. I'm so in awe of their talent. Especially Muna. You know, in this industry as of today, we need our big sisters to look out for us. And I'm beyond thankful that that is what Muna has been to me. Okay, here it goes. To my agent, my producer, Babs. The hardest working man in Nollywood. He is an asshole but... [LAUGHS] But he is one of the coolest people to have in your corner. I'll tell you that for free. I love you, Babs. I can't believe I'm saying this but I love you. [LAUGHS] To my sister, my manager, my friend, Teni. Teni, thank you for believing in me even before I believed in myself. Thank you for protecting me. And for showing me that I could be more. I love you so much. And I cannot wait for our next journey together. This time, you as my business partner. [LAUGHS] It goes without saying that I dedicate this role to the love of my life, my late husband, Hassani Ghadi. Sometimes, that's all we need. Someone who sees what others are afraid to see. And that's what he was to me. Hassani Ghadi was that person to me. I wish more than anything in this world that he was here today. To meet his twins. And to watch them grow. Yes! My children will grow without their father but one thing that they will see is the legacy that he left behind. They will see my next film, my directorial debut. A film Hassani and I wrote together. A film we fell in love to. And that's the crazy thing about this industry. [LAUGHS] People falling in love even if they know that they're not supposed to. I love you, Hassani. [SIGHS] Lastly but most importantly, I wanna dedicate this award to everyone watching this. You in the audience. Those watching from home. If you've ever had a dream, I wanna tell you that, yes, it's gonna be hard. There will be sleepless nights. There will be challenges. But if you believe, and if you work hard, sometimes, dreams do come true. Thank you and good night. [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] ♪ Agnes baby ♪ ♪ Agnes dance ♪ [QUEEN] Time to call it.
