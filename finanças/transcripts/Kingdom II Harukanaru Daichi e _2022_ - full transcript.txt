245 B.C. Qin Dynasty - Inside the Palace Guards! Is this the main chamber? Whose name is it? There's no point in talking to a dying person. It's in the conference chamber, guards! Guards! Protect His Majesty! Where the hell are they from? Your Majesty, it's my negligence. Your Majesty, please get behind the guards. Yin Zheng. Be prepared! Am I a bit late? Shin. How are you... I called. Jie Shi! If there are enough assassins to break into this place, Unification is still far away. You, who were once the subordinates of illegal rebels, Why are you called Shin? At the time of the civil war half a year ago. Defeat the mastermind and Muta alone. A former slave who eventually slain the left. Honestly, better than His Majesty's subordinates. Wouldn't he be of more help? Shin! This kid! Thanks Diao. Have your skills improved? Your Highness the Great, I apologize. All of this is my stupid negligence. If you like, this servant I'll apologize with death! You still make a fuss, mister. Uncle? Chiyu... If only Chiyu had come you all would be dead. Chiyu? A legendary assassin clan said to have superhuman strength. There is an anecdote that he once destroyed a small country alone. Is he a monster? Also known as the 'Clan of Sorrow' 'Clan of Sorrow'? Shit, it's just a rumor anyway, right? Whoever it is, I'll take it lightly. Assassins enter the castle. It's a big deal if it's known to the outside world. Never say anything about this. Your Majesty! - I think you should go back. - What's going on? It is said that the state of Wei crossed the border and began to advance. What? The far-off world of war. Qin, Zhao, Han, Yen, Wei, Qi, Cho is the Spring and Autumn Warring States period. The fierce battle between the seven countries in the Central Plains. It has been going on for 500 years. Shin, who grew up as a war orphan in Jin, a country west of the Central Plains, He had a dream of becoming a general with his friend Piao. But because of his similar appearance with the king Piao then became the king's substitute. He loses his life in a civil war in the palace. Shin meets Yin Zheng, a young king of the Qin Dynasty who dreams of reunifying the Central Plains. Along with Yang Duan He, the King of the Mountains, the royal road heads to Xianyang. The new party who recaptured the throne. One step closer to turbulent times. And now the neighboring country of Wei. Initiate a cross-border invasion. The two countries are about to meet the time of decisive battle on the Dakan Plains. Kingdom 2: Far and Away Xianyang, the royal capital of the Qin Dynasty Set! It's an invasion of Wei. A great war is about to begin. Once you become a slave, you become a slave for life! The only way out is the sword Yes. I will soon become the General of the World Piao. It's finally starting. This is the true first step towards becoming the Great General of the World. Good luck Yes Diao, you wait here. - But... - It's okay. Nice! Where should I go for a run? Good! Go ahead! Hurry up, the war is over! Noisy, kid! What are you? Move fast! Don't hesitate! What? No, are you Shin? You're the gangster Mi-ssi's brother! Don't call me that you were alive. Ever since Piao died, you have gone missing. Of course I thought you were dead too. Yes, the funeral... A lot of people came to the funeral. Yeah, because everyone liked Piao. When one returns from the war, one is expected to straight to the heaven Yes Thanks. But we'll only go to heaven after our dreams come true. Shin, I think you've changed. What happened to you? I saved the king of this great country with my own hands I even got a small house as a prize. It's my own castle! Still talking stupid. From long ago, Piao and I wanted to become the Great Generals of the World. We always say he was bluffing. Noisy! The path for me and Piao starts now. - Hey, wait. - Wait! Is that a warlord? An annoying enemy. Because of being surrounded by enemy countries on all sides and having been at war for a long time, The Wei army is accustomed to fighting. In addition, our army was only just being organized. Losing the war... ... seems to be the only option. There was a general called Hwaryong, right? That's right. Like the six generals of our Qin Dynasty, In the Wei Dynasty, there was a 'Hwaryongchilsa'. They say these are survivors. If he ever comes out... it won't be hard to defeat them. People are assembling I'll make 'O', so let's get together! Five? Don't you even know 'O'? Where did you come from and what did you do? We know that we are the first to go out What is that? 'O' is a group of five infantrymen centered on the five viscera. Five foot soldiers fight as a community of destiny. Our infantrymen, depending on which 'O' they enter. It's decided whether to go back after building a major or become a corpse. Hey, isn't it Hwiryun and Sangyeol? - Let's fight together! - What? I'll introduce you to my little sister when I get back, so come to us. Already married. Hey guys, come in my 'O' you are... It's Paerang! Move! They took Paerang. Their 'O' must be the best Next! Also. Taking away the strong-looking guy... Hear everyone! I am Shin from Seongho Village! Of these, I am the strongest! Are you kidding me? I will become the general of the world... Stop it! You're embarrassing yourself. Are you sick of cold food too? Like a kid. You're not the place to come, it's better to go back. Let's get along well with the rest of us. Hey. When people talk to you, you have to answer Hey! Those are the ones left What? My name is Taku Kei, a master craftsman. I was always with the remaining people because I was an incompetent 5 jang. Who is this weak-looking man? Oh, so there are five of us We are doomed! If it's like this, it's the road to the underworld. Shall we introduce ourselves? I am Shin I'm Mipyeong. This is my younger brother, Mido. Please take care of us. What about that one? We'll be colleagues who will be with you through life and death. so what's your name Outcast. I hate to talk. - What's that attitude? - Fine. Sort them all! Thousands of cavalry will be passing by. The cavalry of the thousand soldiers? Hurry up. A commander of a thousand soldiers will be passing by soon. Rude people sometimes get cut down. Come on! Is that person the Millennium Master? Hey! That idiot is going to run away. Hey, Mr. Wall! Long time no see. Who is this, Shin! You look good named after the Ceiling Wall of Qin Dynasty E h? - Murder? - Yes. Wei attacked Hwanseong on the border. Qin, Hwancheng, Wei The army of Wei was about 90,000. Against him was our army. Although it was defended by 5,000 border guards near Hwanseong, It was captured in the blink of an eye. His Highness, the king to the General Biao Gong who is preparing an expedition.. ... gave the order to conquer. Upon realizing this, the Wei army gathered their resources and deployed their troops to the Dakan Plains. Dakan Plains At that time, the Wei army set fire to the lands. It was said they have slaughtered women, the elderly and even children. What kind of guy would do such a ruthless thing? I am General Oh Gyeong, the commander-in-chief of the Wei army. - General Oh Gyeong? - Yes. He is one of the seven great generals of the Wei Dynasty. He's not even from Wei. He is said to have risen to the rank of general as the God of War. General Oh Gyeong this time. He said he volunteered to be the general commander of the Qin attack. Commander Gung Yuan completed herding on the 1st Hill. General, we secured the two hills first. This gave our military an overwhelming advantage. Oh Gyeong-gun, commander-in-chief of the Wei Dynasty. You lost the hill? Are you going to spread your defenses while invading? Hills are like castles in flatland battles. Strong defense and easy attack. - General! - General! General Biao Gong. Not all infantry have been rallied yet. The enemy intends to overwhelm the two hills and set up a defensive line. Better not to move... Commander-in-Chief of the Qin Dynasty General Biao Gong. If the hill was lost, you can take it back Go out! What do you think? We need a quick decision. Isn't it too hasty to move in this state? Qin Dynasty Cheoninjang Evergreen this will bleed a lot. What is our commander-in-chief's thinking? Hurry up! The enemy is already in formation How much longer do you have to run? It means we're behind Ready your mind. A lot of people will die. Something has changed in the air. What is it? There's something in front of this Hey Shin! Wait a minute. All forces, stop! Is this a real battlefield 4th Army infantrymen, gather! - 4th Army? - This is our army. Let's go. I am Park Ho-shin, the master of heaven! We will attack soon. Park Ho-sin, commander of the Qin Dynasty. Arrange the troops in a line! Get going! Chief, please wait. We have been running for two days straight to the Dakan Plains here. Rest at least until you catch your breath We can't afford it. But do you mean to charge without knowing the situation? Don't talk back to your chief! Stop! Don't blindly lead the soldiers. From now on, I will fight with my life on the front line these are precious soldiers. - That person a while ago... - Wall Did you say 'Wall'? Don't get into a discussion with a newbie Mind your zone! Arrange Park Ho-shin's troops! Move on, you slugs! Get ready! Our advance is currently at a numerical disadvantage. Wei army lost two hills and was geographically inferior. You have only one purpose! Take the hill at the risk of your lives! From now on, the infantry is the full force. Break through the defense line at the foot of the mountain! What kind of an order is that! Nonsense Be prepared. Because Park Ho-shin is known to be a crazy attack guy. He will fall back at the first strong challenge Do we really have to fight these guys? Are you okay, brother? To throw up like an idiot. Commander Gong Yuan. Jin's infantry troops that have just arrived are aligning their formations. Oh Gyeong-gun, general of the Wei Dynasty. Is it an immediate charge upon arrival? You're too hasty. Now that the hill has been taken away. Waiting for the maintenance of the soldiers. Sound the charge signal! The 3rd Army Infantry is still there! Does not matter What? The assault order has been given. Listen up, you'll never be left alone. Do you know? Got it. It's finally starting. Are you watching, Piao? Even for our hero. We must return to Seongho Village alive. Infantry, ready! Rear regular army. Preparations! Get set Charge! Defensive Formation! What is that? Come back! You can't go alone! Come back! Cut that fool down first! Shin! Die. Encircle him! Over there! Let's charge! Come! Push now or never! It's impossible. I cannot Brother! Brother! Help me! This kid! It's okay? It hurts, you bastard! Run away, brother, we are no match for you. Brother Taku Kei! Two minutes now Stupid stuff! Speaking of small puppies who can't do anything by themselves! Shut up! I don't care what anyone says. This is how 'O' fights. Here goes! 'Five people fighting as one' This is a great tactic. Damn it. But we are alone after that Shin fellow jumped off. There's even a kid who don't do anything, so it's just us three Where did Shin go? You missed Damn! Leader! Shin. Commander Gong Yuan. The lines are shifting unexpectedly. Shall we deploy the 3rd Battalion? No. Send it out. Come up and see! What. Wow, this is dangerous. Are you running away?! The enemy is retreating Did we win? Hey Shin! You were awesome! Stupid kid! Run away! Run away! This is not the time to stand idly by! Shin, I have lived, thanks to you. What is that? It's the armored chariot squad. That is the armored chariot squad that prides itself on being the strongest in the midfield. What is an armored chariot squad? There's no way we can win The real fight starts now. This is only the first wave. That is the chariot squad, the main unit will come with the 2nd wave. A large army will come, so that there will be no chance of escape. Enemy chariots are overrunning the infantry of the 4th Army. The cavalry needs help! General Biao Gong. Tell all the cavalry. Yeah! Wait. Yeah! Yes? Damn it. Are there no reinforcements? I'm going to die from this! Everyone stick close behind me I will try to collide in front of this judge That's so reckless. So what do we do? There is a way... - You... - You're alive. What a relief. What's the way? - You can build a barrier. - A barrier? How do you do that? Pile up the corpses What kind of stupid idea is that? Let's try. Guys, collect the corpses and stack them up! Brother Taku Kei! Come on! Is the chariots charge ordered yet? Another standby flag has been raised Come on! Now it's done Hide behind the barrier! Shin, hurry up! The rat is escaping. Catch and kill him! Beware! We did it! Good job, Outcast! Listen up! We haven't lost yet! The fight starts now! Our fleet... attacked the enemy's 4th, 2nd, and 1st infantry corps and annihilated most of them. Only a few remnants of the 4th Infantry are resisting. Biao Gong seems to have completely abandoned the infantry. Completely divided and isolated from the main camp. Our army has an overwhelming advantage! General Biao Gong does not understand war. Leaving only the garrison to defend the base. All troops, get down from the hill and march Annihilate the remaining infantry below. Bring me the head of that Biao Gong! Report! The main forces of the enemy general Gong Yuan have begun to descend from the hills. What happened to our infantry? 1st Army, annihilated. Report! 4th Army, almost annihilated. Reports came in that a small group of infantry had defeated the chariot squad! Now it's just a matter of time 2nd Army, mostly annihilated. 3rd Army, struggling. Please retreat. So, there are only a few left in the 4th Army? That's right. General. For now, let us evacuate! No, let us wait. General! I say wait! Yeah! Enemies descending from the hill. Why aren't the reinforcements coming? Don't expect anything like that! His Highness the Great, the report of the war has arrived. What is the front line like? Reportedly, our infantry has been trampled by Wei armored chariot squad! Most of them. It is said to be destroyed Is it true? The infantry is destroyed... Wei troops are clearing out the remnants. Damn, I got nowhere to go Damn. I'm going to kill without leaving anyone behind. Let's move to the side with fewer enemies Over there! Mipyeong! Outcast, you... Amazing... If you're capable enough, you should have helped. I protect my own self, and no obligation to protect you. We are the same team. Then why did you come to the battlefield for? I found it! It's here! - I came. - Now it's wrong. I'll cover you here, you guys go. - It's too dangerous. - Shut up and go! Over there This way. Come on! Brother. Surround yourself! Okay I'll be sure to join you later, Shin! Go! Hurry! Kid, let go of this! Outside the river, are you stupid? Why did you stay? You should run away too. It's easier to hit enemies from back here than run away Go over there! Do whatever you want, even if you die, I don't care I won't die. I can't die in a place like this. Me too, stupid kid. Are you a kid? Hurry up and get rid of it Damn. Toong, Tangtang. Toong, Tangtang What? Toong, Tangtang. Toong, Tangtang. Are you turning around because you are scared? Is this guy a monster? - What? - Now, go get 'em! What is it? - Breath... - Breath? Are you a woman? He must have played with us! Run away! I'll be surrounded Get up You... Come on! Out of the river, run away. Yes, you too! Stupid kid! Crazy fellows took their own lives Don't move yet You have injured your head You barely survived yourself Barely Did you do it? It'll do for now. What the hell are you doing? Why did you, a woman, come to the battlefield? How did you become so strong? Don't talk What? You threw your whole body and also mine into the pit. Ouch! That hurts. My side hurts so much Help me! Noisy. I will give you only one answer, so choose It better be good. How strong... No. Why did you, a woman, come to the battlefield? To avenge an enemy? Or someone else's? Who are you? Sister. Sister Kang Sang's enemy. My older sister, who was more precious than my life, was murdered. The man who killed your sister. Is the killer in this battlefield? No. The enemy is in the country of Wei but I don't know how to go. Did you go to war because of that reason? Is it like that? Revenge Which is why... you said you couldn't die. It was because you had to kill your sister's enemy. Not a man What? The enemy is a kinswoman We only have girls Only women? It's okay, don't worry about me. How are you? Your eyes... You have such sad eyes. Also known as the 'Clan of Sorrow' There is an anecdote that she once destroyed a small country alone. A legendary assassin clan said to have superhuman strength. Chi-woo. How do you know that name? What are you doing? I am Shin a colleague of the same class What colleague? I know your pain. I also have a friend who is like a brother... You mean the clan? I heard you talking to brother Mipyeong. He lost a guy like that so he's in the same situation as me? Yes Totally different. What do you know about Chiyu. So tell me what's different. What are you? Chiyu is a cursed clan not coming out of the mountain. Ever since I was a kid, I've been training only to kill. When choosing a successor. Candidates to become the next Chiwoo from each clan gather. Kill and kill each other until the last one is left. Only the last one who survives becomes Chi-woo. Hassan is allowed bereaved family. Ajok's Lord. Everyone is a strong opponent. Sword Noksu. Tomorrow, I must protect Outcast. Sister Kang Sang Outcast. I really thought of you as my younger sister Me too, sister. But tomorrow we have to fight each other for ourselves. Even if the enemy in front of us is each other. Don't worry about it. The one who will survive tomorrow is my sister. That means tomorrow you die. I don't care. I hope you don't die tomorrow. That's not possible. There can only be one person left. - That's the rule. - I know. I know Me too ... to survive. There are so many things I want to do. What do you want to do? I want to get to know a man Man? Isn't it too early for you? I want to go out of the mountains and visit a place called 'Nara' on the plains. I want to meet the people who live there too. And above all... I will do my best as soon as I can. I once cut a guy who looked strong first. My sister will take care of the rest. Kang Sang's older sister. She'll be Chi-woo and she'll go out into the world it's okay, Noksu. Because I decided to Let's sleep. It smells like sleeping drug! Sister! Sister Thank God It looks like my sister won Oh no Sister. It wasn't because she had a weak sister. Because she was rather strong, everyone was aiming for her right from the start. It was all done by Yu-ryun. Is that guy her sister's nemesis? Yes My life is just. She only exists to kill him. When will the revenge be over? When I die, I will go to where my sister is. Don't talk nonsense I won't allow it! - You're wrong. - What? I don't know what's going on. Keep chasing the enemy with those eyes. After avenging against your enemies, you will die too? Yes, is that bad? Of course! Is that the only reason I can't die here? Stupid bastard. I will become the Great General of the World. It was also Piao's dream. I made a promise with Piao so I can't die I will be the best. If you see that, Piao will surely smile This is why I can't die Outcast How about your sister? If you take revenge and die. Will your sister be happy? But... I have nothing else to do. What about your sister's dream? I don't remember. She must have had a dream of her own too. When you recall that dream you might ease the sorrow the sun has risen I'll be spotted by the enemy it's over now Hey! - Here! - What? - Here you are. - Shin. You're here! You are alive! You're all right. I'm so glad What are you happy about? There's only one thing we're dangerous for. - Outcast! - Kang Oe. - You're both alive. - Good. You are... ... a woman? Victory or defeat will be decided today. Due to the chariots attack yesterday. Most of the enemy front line troops were destroyed. There will be no strength left to resist the advance. Send the 3rd Battalion out to the plains! Yeah! All troops, that's the charge signal. Gung Yuan's battalion begins marching toward the enemy headquarters! The main body of the Wei army is coming. Those who are mobile, take the weapons and return to your ranks. Damn! We must have the momentum to attack General Biao Gong's headquarters at once. Are there orders yet? Still waiting 4th Army Cavalry. Defensive Formation! It looks like it's engaged in a skirmish with the main force above. Where we are. It is between the enemy's large army and the hill where the base is located. They are completely isolated from their allies. How many allies are left around? There should be about 30 infantrymen. Let's run away Let's go to the plains No. How about attacking instead of running away? What? Kid! How are we going to attack? Over there ... the garrisons ... are trapped. It'll be fine, Shin! Advance! Report. Dozens of enemy remnants at the foot of the hill coming up this way Dozens? That hill? The Qin Dynasty is full of idiots. Leave the puppies alone. Respond with 2,000 garrisons in the middle more than that. Our target is the neck of the Biao Gong. The front line was annihilated by the main forces of the palace. Great General, we must retreat. Dozens of survivors from the 4th Army. It is a report that you have reached the foot of the hill where the palace is located. Dozens? Too few in number. It's just a matter of time Funny. General Biao Gong! It's a tiny spark but... Among the infantry of the 4th Army. There is an unusual little spark. There's always something special about that place. One movement moves a column. It is connected by cloth and breaks down the bay. The chain that starts with a small fire starts a big fire. The whole country will come to an end in an instant. That's what war is, guys. Yeah! - Send a messenger. - Yes. To the battlefield of the 4th Army My entire army! It's an assault! Yeah! Order the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cavalry. Gather on the battlefield of the 4th Army! Order the 4th Army Cavalry. Stop the invasion of the enemy battalion! Join the 4th Army on the battlefield! It's an assault order! This is it! Charge! Park Ho Shin! You can't beat an enemy battalion by numbers. Split in two! The enemy is not a battalion of shores. General Biao Gong's real goal is ... to turn the tide from now on. Break through enemy lines like this with the remaining infantry. Aim for the head on the hill! It's unreasonable, it'll be a dog's death! Reinforcement! Wall, can't go back now. Damn it Wall bag! Support the breakthrough of Park Ho-shin's unit. Our troops break through the center. Follow me! Let go of this! - Brother! - Holy shit! Too many enemies. The garrison is like this. Park Ho-shin's troops assault! Hit the garrison above! Wei garrison retreat to the forest and regroup your positions! I'm Captain Park Ho-shin. Did that guy just pierce it? It's over now. We can live now! The cavalry will take care of the rest. Idiots, nothing is final yet! You have survived the chariots attack. In addition, it is the pride of Park Ho-shin's unit that they even launched a counterattack. If you are the ones who came out through with desperate hands. Even more hands can help overcome the enemy From now on, our unit will take the top of the hill I will take the head of the enemy commander. Is that true? I thought we were barely alive. Should have been. There are only weird guys in my unit this time before. Keep in mind that this is a very important battle that is directly related to Jin's victory. Infantry, follow the cavalry! The cowards fled without hesitation. Be prepared! You mean break through that front? If the goal is to break through, there's no need to defeat the enemy Rush them with full power. What's up? Speak up. 'Cause I can't die in a place like this Right Okay, you guys. It's an assault! Are you the leader? Hey, what's that? Is it a raid? Is it the cavalry? Did you break through to the army? It's an enemy attack! Enemies are everywhere How do you fight this? Don't be swayed by the numbers! Breaking through is the goal. If you only cut down the enemies in front of you, you can definitely escape! Right! Easy to say! Stop it! The troop's gap is too big I can't stand it for long! Mido! Now. Follow Shin! Break through! Are you okay? Separated from infantry. The cavalry corps heads for the summit with all their might Hey. Without the protection of the cavalry, those guys don't stand a chance Both mounted and infantry are in the line of attack. It's all for victory, that's what an 'army' is all about. Come out of the 'O' and take the lead. 'Cause now I need one more horse Go ahead Shin. That Shin is not to be trifled with I knew it right away. Did you not say you were going to become a Great General? Outcast What do you think? It's just a nuisance Do not say that. Here goes Meet you at the top Yes. Go! If you cut the leader's head, you can turn the tide of the game. Let's defeat the Wei General Oh Dyeong from the enemy base! There is no end. Mido! I am Shin a colleague of the same class Thanks Help my brother more than me. I can't move because I hurt my leg. What was your sister's dream? She must have had a dream of her sister too. If you remember that dream. Might ease your sorrow Wake up and run away. No. I can't move. I'm done, help my brother Please! It's because his brother asked for it. Outcast Done! It's over now. I die here You will live. I too survived. There are so many things I want to do. What do you want to do? I want to go out of the mountains and see a place called 'Nara' on the plains. I want to meet the people who live there too. And above all... I want to laugh to my heart's content. What is it Sister Outcast Just laugh. Out of the river, go! Get up, go. I'm wrong You can do it You are still alive! Okay Brother, are you okay? Yes Let's go. Leave Fumi to me. Everyone has to get to the top alive Go! See you from above. I see the main base. Commander Gong Yuan. A cavalry unit that broke through the halfway garrison is heading this way. Lihyeon Hwang Leave it to me. Hwang Ri-hyeon archers ready to fire a salvo! Launch! Caught the enemy. Don't be afraid of arrows. The summit is right in front of you! Launch! Are you okay? Can't fall here. Yeah This is over. Nonsense! Did you see my arrows? Chief, evacuate! Don't panic. You guys just got lucky No luck. Crossing the bridge made by dead comrades. I came here Stupid. If you don't defeat me, everyone will die. Thousands! You're coming to me who can't see anymore You are really stupid. Wei army commander Gong Yuan Defeated! Head of the palace! Retreat! Retreat immediately! Come on get off! Wall, look over there! There's a Qin flag on the hill. The flag of the Qin Dynasty was raised on the Hill of Gong Yuan. It is thanks to the dance of the Cheoninjangnim. But the garrison halfway up is pursuing. There are only ten of us compared to over a thousand enemy troops. I'm angry, but I have to go down the hill with the head of the palace attendant. Don't be stupid. Guys who want to go down can go down I will fight here What's up. Refrain from talking about infantry! Park Ho-sin Cheoninjang. He said he was able to come this far because of the sacrifices of his allies. Such an important place. Are you saying you would give up just because a thousand people were pushing up? Kid. What is your name? Shin Listen up, Shin. Bravery and recklessness are different If you get it wrong. It leaves nothing behind, only hastening death. With this, the tide will change Go down the hill with everyone To the dead You go forward to win... Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang! - Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang! - Cheoninjang! Shin! You! You were alive! Ow, ow So painful. Thanks to Kang Oe stay behind for us. I fought until I was exhausted Thanks, Outcast The enemy is coming up With the head of a palace. Go down the hill to the back where there are no enemies. Who is Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang? Of course I'll take you Let's go. I can't leave it between enemies I will help. - You take the way back. - Yeah. Nonsense. Where are all these large armies... Look over that hill. The hill above where the base was located was empty. Does that mean the enemy commander-in-chief has started moving? Damn it. I just reached the top of the hill. He looks like he's going to be trapped in a pincer attack. It will be twice as many as the palace troops. The Fire Dragons above, the Five Classics. It is said that there are more than one hundred tactics of the Red Masters and Pentecostals. Our commander-in-chief, Changpyeong-gun, I'm on an expedition with the Monk Yeobulwi. If only Xianyang had a military like that... What? What's going on, window? Bird we don't know Which army. It's a report that went to the Dakan Plains. Someone from the war. He's been away for a long time No way... Why are you here? Are you really that guy? Yes, it is said that he climbed the first hill 500 times. Only 500? What are you thinking? In any case, you must run to the side with fewer enemies. Gee! Are you going back already? I just got fun. General Ouki - General Ouki Boy Shin. We met again You. It was quite noticeable from a distance. - Surprised? - But. It's a different story if you become a general in the world. In short. Do you think it fell short of expectations? Does it fall short of your expectations? Yes. Are you saying I look weak? Similar. Do you think it's just ahead of the curve? You know what? That I've been standing on a limb ever since. Forgive our foot soldiers for their rudeness! In this situation. The general's arrival is heaven's help. Please lead the 4th Army including us I hate it. General. We are not allowed to go to war I'll get scolded if I arbitrarily intervene I just. The view looks good, so I just went up. Right, back adjutant? Yes, the best view Look at this. This is the moment when the game of war moves detect signs of change. Move cautiously and boldly. Wu Qing, the general of the Wei Dynasty, must have. He is a great general who will become a threat to the nations. When it comes to resourcefulness, the best in Wei. But the battlefield isn't all about resourcefulness sometimes. Sometimes the instinct to act according to wild intuition wins. Instinct? Look over there. A general who follows his instincts. You're about to collide with the Five Books of Resources. Fast. That man is our commander-in-chief. You're General Biao Gong. Boy Shin. Won't you stick with me? Will resourcefulness win? Will instinct win? Amazing. Now, how do we draw the Wei General Oh Dyeong out? Report. Commander Biao Gong broke through the 1st Battalion! Smashed them into pieces! It's a chariots charge from the back! The cavalry behind the general is being attacked. It is a strategic tactic in the Book of War It takes the opposite side by surprise, but... Response must be quick and appropriate It's like catching an angry bull. One don't have to concentrate on the head Yes, first of all, one must break down the momentum by attacking the rear It's true. Was that a reckless charge by the general? Definitely it is an important point in the battle. Up until now, the charge looks to be recklessly carried out. But as a result, something must happen to turn the tide of the battle Oh Dyeong came down the advantageous hill to face Biao Gong. In other words, even if the charge seemed like a reckless move, it can be turned into an advantage on the battle field All for victory. The move is a noble sacrifice. Then... Do you understand? Boy Shin. All the sacrifices made so far. The final outcome is everything! These are the war moves that the two of them have taken in order to win. Just two people Such a great battle... Boy Shin. That's what being a general is about General General of the World General Ouki, please lend me a horse Please give it to me. Commander Yes Thank you Hey! See you later That guy.. gone. You seem to like that boy quite a bit. Fools like that usually die early. Yeah. But sometimes you may find a special one There's a villager on your left! Close in on him! Stick with me! Get him! Surround him! Get him! Break through to where the Five Classics are. Yes! - The army is coming. - Stay calm. All troops, prepare for battle! All right. General, please retreat. Ouki... you have come. That's why I can't stop I must stand and fight! Oh Dyeong. I have only met you You men must not intervene I thought you were only a cold-hearted book-keeper. But who would have expected you to have such deep ambitions. It's going to be a battle between the generals. That's me! Your Qin Dynasty have destroyed my family from a small country My country and my family. In order to destroy the Qin Dynasty, which have caused much sufferings. I have been dreaming of it! I come from the country of Wei I have risen to the rank of general. Yes, that I did. Is that your reason for starting the war? The culling of small countries is a common occurrence in the Warring States period. Like the bitter pain you have experienced. They are everywhere! Right. So the war never ends! War has been going on for 500 years. It could continue for another 500 years. I will sacrifice my sword to prevent the next 500 years of war. I will... become the first king to unify the Central Plains. I will settle this score! Come on, Oh Dyeong! It's been quite a while General. Or is it 'king'? The way you stared from the top of the hill gave me inspiration Is that so? I was just passing by and having a look. It's amazing that you can defeat that Oh Dyeong. Raise a shout of victory! Defeating the Fire Dragons and the Five Classics lowered the morale of the Wei troops. Having lost their general, the Wei army had no choice but to retreat. Also to avoid further confrontation. It can be said that the further losses of our military was minimized. Shin! Hey Shin! You are here. - You're okay. - Yes. It is over. We are still alive! Let's go home! Go to Asu Drink or no drink? Unfortunately, I have other business to attend to. Come on, it's a drinking party! Outcast. Wait a minute Where are you going? To avenge your sister? At least we should celebrate together at least once. You have won a hard fight I am done here. I'm going after the Wei. Is it because you don't know where Wei is? Noisy as usual You came to this battlefield. I think you're lucky to have met us Why? You were a little something. It seems that your eyes have changed. It's my mood that's changed Maybe so Rather... I helped you more. You did. I have a long way to go too. To become the Great General of the World, training is still required. - Training? - Yes. I saw the generals and knew what I have to do Me too. If you sincerely wish for the unification of Yin Zheng and Jungwon, than I have to do more. I must be stronger than now Be sure to come back Outcast You're our mate now. And once again we will fight as mates to win. That's when I will make a toast. We can then celebrate and laugh heartily See you again See you again Shin. Diao. What? Were you worried that I might die? No, I'm not. By the way, you came back with a certain confidence about yourself, right? Of course, you missed me? Yes, it was hard Yes Welcome back Yes Shin. While you were gone, I have made up my mind What was it? I'm going to the battlefield too What? Weak guys like you die quickly I fight with my head, not my sword Huh? Someday I will help you fool with this head Do you know what it is? Don't say "military", it's "strategy". Do as you will Must be fun. - Shin is to be a centurion? - Yes. It has just been decided in the treatise. A slave boy turned into a centurion in one battle? It's obviously an unusual achievement. It was said he also had recommendations from many field officers. Yes. This is our war. Jie Shi. Thank you for coming to our camp. The real fight starts now. Your Highness the Great. I did a detailed investigation of what happened the other day, and who lured the assassins into the depths of the castle I wonder if there is an insider Who could have done that? There's only one person No matter... Report. Shohei has just arrived. Together with Lu Buwei and Meng Wu, they request an audience with Your Highness - Audience granted. - Yes. Prime Minister Lu Buwei Shohei Meng Wu It was a great win. The Battle of Dakan Plains is being rejoiced by all the people Ah, it was a victory by the soldiers Haonde I've heard rumours of some commotion in the palace. Someone is trying to assassinate His Highness. Was there an treacherous gang within? Regarding that... It must have been a top secret, but how did you know? That... It's because the darkness is the God of Gods. I admit. Stop kidding, Sang-sang. There's no way you'd do something like that. Of course here comes the joke. He's committed great rudeness in an attempt to lighten the mood. Forgive me. Nonsense. You can't catch me even if I claim to be the culprit. That's the difference in power. Now I will have to be patient. By the end of this day. My men will definitely reveal the details. Please protect me. I'm sorry, Shin It's alright. Because I was ordered by Wall to support Shin. That's General Ouki's Castle. Right. But for what purpose... I am going to be trained under General Ouki I can't wait! "Kingdom" by Yasuhisa Hara. Screenplay: Tsutomu Kuroiwa Yasuhisa Hara.
