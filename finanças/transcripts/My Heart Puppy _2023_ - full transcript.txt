"No animals were harmed during the making of this film" "GINGKO TREE PUBLISHING" "DEAREST SEONG-GYEONG HI, MY LOVE" I'm sorry! Runie! I'm home! Give me your sweet paw. Runie, this one doesn't smell as delicious today. The other one. This one smells as delicious as ever. My sweet puppy. My gosh, Runie. Looks like you're all ready for the summer. You must be hungry. Hold on, okay? Just a second. Let's put some salmon for you. Runie, I heard dried pollack is a great immune booster. There, it's ready. Runie, here. Runie, let's eat. You must have been really hungry. Good boy, eat up. Oh, he peed a lot. Runie. Runie, today is a super important day for me. So I can't take you out for a walk. But we'll play in the park by the river all day this Sunday. How does that sound? Sounds good, right? Awesome. Give me your sweet paw. Good boy. The other one. Runie, the other one. Runie, I'm going to be late. The other one. That's my boy. I'll see you later. See you later. - Hello. - Hello. Everything's ready inside. - Is she here? - Yes. Hey, you're here. Don't tell me you turned away other customers because of me. I met my wife thanks to you. This is the least I can do for you. Thanks. I'm so touched. Min-su, you see, staying single isn't such a bad thing at all. What? Just saying. What are you talking about? Anyway, all right. Good luck. I can do this. Hey, babe. I'm here. Min-su, why are you all dressed up today? Huh? Oh, just because. I didn't have lunch, so I'm starving right now. I'm sorry. - Babe, but I was just wondering... - What? Can we chat for a minute before we order? I need to eat. I'm getting heartburn. Okay, I'll make it quick. All right. "Dearest Seong-gyeong." "Hi, my love." "Coincidence brought us together while we were traveling in Taiwan." "And we fell in love." "Today, we celebrate the 1,000th day of our relationship." Is it our 1,000th-day anniversary? It is. My gosh, I had no idea. Babe, I'm sorry, but can you just let me finish reading this? Okay. "Whenever I look into your eyes," "I'm so grateful that the woman with the warmest and loveliest soul" "in the whole wide world is right by my side." "I'm very timid and sensitive." "I'm not really good at anything and have a lot to learn." "But I want to become..." "the most amazing man in the world for you." "So I'm going to work harder to become a better man for you." "I want to make you happy for the rest of your life." "That's my dream." Seong-gyeong. Will you marry me? Yes. That's it. Go all the way. Nine. This is the last one. You can do it. Slowly. I'm sorry. The sales numbers were unusually low this month. I'll send you 1,500 dollars first. I'm sorry, Uncle. Oh, no. It's not too bad. The industry changed quite a bit while I was running the caf√©. I'm learning and adjusting. Yes, of course. All right, take care. Oh, no. Darn it! I'm broke right now! Come on! Hi there. Do you think you can lose weight by going that slow? I don't think so. Whoa, don't do that. You'll hurt yourself. You're trying to lose weight, right? Yes. But why? I want to impress my girlfriend. You're probably younger than me, so I'll drop the honorifics. What's your name? Lee Byung-hun. Byung-hun, I'll let you in on a secret. You see, I weighed 90kg when I was in 12th grade. - Really? - Yes! Do you know how I lost weight? How? I can't explain how I did it without showing you. Book 100 personal training sessions with me. Then I'll make sure you lose 20kg. - 20kg? - Yes! I believe experience is the best teacher. I can teach you because I've done it myself. You can do anything to lose 20kg, right? Yes, I can do anything. Great. Let's do this! Okay! But I have to get my mom's permission. - Your mom? - Yes. All right. Yes, there are many great fitness channels on YouTube. But those trainers on YouTube don't exactly know about Byung-hun. Because they've never met him. But so many people watch those videos to train. Ma'am, what if he overexerts himself while following those routines and ends up with a herniated disk? No! That'd be horrible. Exactly! A good personal trainer is like a tailor. I'll design a workout routine that's perfectly customized for Byung-hun. Working out with me will improve his concentration and boost his confidence. It will also help him a lot in his studies. How much will it cost though? Money is important, but I care a lot more about my clients and their health. If you stop by this evening, I'll give you a discount. Then can I stop by at nine? This is so pretty. Babe, I haven't talked to you about this yet, but I've been thinking about where we should live after we get married. And the conclusion is... Let's sign a lump-sum lease for an apartment near Gimpo Airport. Really? Yes. I know how tired you get after each flight. You have a job that is emotionally and physically taxing. I always felt bad about it. I want to live near the airport to make things easier for you. My gosh, I'm so touched. But isn't that area pretty expensive? There's something I haven't told you yet. When my mother passed away, I inherited a small house that was under her name. If I sell that house and use my savings, I should be able to pay the deposit without taking out a loan. What's wrong? Why didn't you tell me about that house? Well... If you used to live there with your mother, why did you move out? Well, the house is old. So the heating doesn't work properly. And there's no subway station nearby. Where is it? I'd say it's about a 15-minute walk from my place? Min-su. I thought we knew everything about each other. But you kept such an important thing from me. It hurts my feelings a little. I'm sorry. What's wrong? I just realized that there's something I never told you. What is it? "JUNG SEONG-GYEONG" What is this? My allergy medication. My entire family is allergic to dog saliva. When I come in contact with dog saliva, my throat swells up to the point that I can't breathe. So you had to take this every time we met up? Only when Runie was there. You said Runie helped you find solace after your mother passed away. Runie is your family, so I didn't want you to worry about my allergy. But if we get married and start living together... I can't take those pills every day. We'll have a baby someday, you know. Babe. Don't worry. Everyone in my family loves Runie. If I ask them, they'll be happy to take him. Are you sure they'll be okay with it? Yes, they take care of him for me from time to time anyway. Babe, I'll make sure... you won't have to take this again. I'm sorry. Is it not possible to get rid of the allergy? Dog saliva has a few types of proteins that can cause allergies. But they can't be cured since allergies are hereditary. What do I do? There's a simple solution. What is it? Don't get married. I'm serious right now. Goodness. Okay, all right. Min-su, don't worry. You have me. I'll help you. But who in the family can look after Runie? Let's see. Our second aunt won't be able to take him since her husband recently quit his job. And our youngest aunt is out of the question because Ji-ho is taking the CSAT. What about Uncle? Has he looked after Runie before? He hasn't? No! Aunt was bitten by a dog once, so she's afraid of big dogs. Runie never bites people. Come on! That's what you think. When you're traumatized by an experience like that, even seeing something similar makes you freeze instinctively. Hey, is there a reason it has to be someone in the family? Because I won't be able to trust the person otherwise. It doesn't have to be a family member. You can find a good person you can trust. But how? Post on Instagram that you're looking for someone to adopt Runie. On Instagram? Many people do that these days. But I can't use my account because Seong-gyeong follows me on Instagram. I told her someone in the family would be happy to take Runie. Hey, you're on Instagram? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me? You never asked. Whatever. How many followers do you have? My follower count has probably gone up. Let's see. 30 followers. Gosh! Are you serious? You've got to be kidding me. - That's like nothing. - Huh? What? How many do you have? Hey, I have 30,000 followers. No way. Gosh, you have practically no followers. "KIM JIN-GUK / 31K FOLLOWERS" My gosh. But you're old. How do you have 30,000 followers? Hey, I'm not old! I was born in 1978. My life's just beginning now. Come on! Look at all these wrinkles here. - How will you begin your life... - Why you little! - Jeez, seriously. - Okay, fine. But can you really trust someone you met on Instagram? I'm sure some are trustworthy, and some are not. Talk to them in person and find out. You never know. When do you need to rehome Runie by? I don't know. I'm not even sure if it's the right thing to do. It's just a matter of finding the right person. If you find someone who will love Runie as much as you do, you won't feel so bad about it. Hey, let's just take one step at a time. Let's post on my Instagram and see if we can find someone who wants to adopt Runie. You can rehome him if you find someone you really like. If that doesn't happen, we'll look for another solution. We have no idea how long it would take, so let's start soon. Okay, I think that's a good plan. Then how much will you pay me for the ad? - "Ad"? - Hey, think about it. I have 30,000 followers. When an influencer like me puts on an advertisement, it's obvious I need to be compensated for it. When did you become such a jerk? Why are you calling me a jerk? So many companies DM me for ad inquiries. Come on. You only have 30,000 followers, not 300,000. No way. It's not like I'm asking for a huge sum. Hey, I'm dirt broke right now, and my screen is all cracked. When I'm on the phone, the shards dig into my skin. I'm asking you to help me get this replaced, and you call me a jerk? Quiet down. Whatever! I don't care. Just help me out! You're that broke? Yeah. Okay, fine. If you find someone who'll adopt Runie, I'll get you a new screen. I'll do my best, sir. Bow to me politely. I'm sorry I got home so late. If I can't find someone who will think of you as their family, I won't send you anywhere, so don't worry. I promise. My phone's blowing up. Being an influencer sure isn't easy. Let's see. Who's this? "HELLO! IT'S ME, PARK MI-SUN!" Oh, it's Mi-sun. I trained her a while back. Her husband is good-looking. Right? He's very handsome. I know. He kind of looks like me when I was younger. Who does the baby take after? He just fell asleep. - Thank you for coming. - Of course. No problem at all. Let me explain our situation. I read in a book that kids who grow up with dogs have stronger immune systems and tend to be a lot more sociable. My husband and I have decided to have only one kid. So we kept wondering if we should get a dog to make sure our kid wouldn't feel lonely. Then I saw your post on Instagram. - Runie, right? - Yes. He's so cute! "PARK SEONG-JIN" Why is this person calling me? You must put your phone on vibrate in theaters and around babies. You have no manners. You'll never become an agent of Kingsman. "Kingsman"? That's so random. I'm so sorry. It's okay. No worries. Why don't we sit closer? Because of my baby. Is anyone in your family allergic to dogs? Dog saliva has a few types of proteins that can cause allergies. If you were born allergic to dogs, it can't be cured. Don't worry. Once, a friend of mine brought her dog to our place, and the baby was fine. - I'm glad to hear that. - Yeah. It seems like you both think it'll work out, so why don't we meet Runie together? - Sounds good! - Great. Then let's... Darn it. Turn off the barking! "ORDER RUNIE'S FOOD" Darn it. I'm sorry, baby. You'll never become a Kingsman agent either. - Hey, did you not eat breakfast? - Why? Your breath smells like poop. Only jerks attack others' weaknesses. Quiet! Can you both put your phones on silent mode? So when can I meet Runie? If you have some time today... Where are your manners? Enough is enough! Sorry to interrupt while you're letting out your anger. You'd better be. Looks like your mother-in-law needs to speak to you. "MOTHER-IN-LAW" Let's talk another time. Okay. Hey, let's go. Put on the guest slippers. Oh, sure. Getting a golden retriever has always been my dream. Overseas, you see cool people walking their golden retrievers. I wanted to become successful and go for walks with my golden retriever. I have a company that sells chicken breasts, and it finally made it big last year. Well, not that big. Our last year's revenue was over 8 million dollars. - This is my living room. - Whoa. Wow, look at that! It's just a humble abode, perfect for a single guy. - Hey, you must've hit the jackpot! - Gosh, no. No, wait! Hold on a second. What's he doing? Don't move. What's wrong? What is it? I'm a bit of a neat freak. Gosh, you're covered in dog hair. You know that golden retrievers shed a lot, right? Really? Especially during shedding seasons. One touch, and your hand will be covered. Will you be okay with that? Is there a golden retriever that doesn't shed? Have you seen a short-necked giraffe? Come on. How can a giraffe have a short neck? I'm trying to tell you that all golden retrievers shed. Oh, I see. But I don't appreciate the way you just said it. Then shall I be more direct? Yeah, be direct. A dog isn't a decorative object. Don't get a dog until you're ready to truly love it. Hey... I'll see you another time. Are you sure we can find someone this way? It's because they've never had a dog in their lives. The person we'll meet next used to have a dog. A golden retriever, just like Runie. Really? Who is this person? One of the regulars at my old caf√©. The thing is though, his dog died from cancer. Sang-ho. Sang-ho? Hey, pass me your phone for a sec. I want to show you something. You have your phone. The glass dust will get on my fingers. Just hand it over. - Don't go through my albums. - Why would I go through your photos? Here. What do you think? These dogs look so happy. Their tails are perked up. The under-eye area looks so clean. Looks like the owner takes great care of them. Do you know this person? No. I couldn't fall asleep last night. So I was browsing on Instagram, and this account popped up. But this person lives in Jeju Island. That's too far. Gosh, I'm sorry. I don't think he'll come down. He's going through puberty, so he's on edge these days. No worries. We understand. When did your dog pass away? It's already been over a month. But he's having a hard time accepting it. I get it though. We adopted him from a shelter when Sang-ho was four and lived with him for ten years. My gosh, no wonder he's still so devastated. I thought adopting a similar dog would help him, so I brought it up, but he got so upset with me. Then I happened to see your post on Instagram. He was a regular at my old caf√©. Oh, really? I love the pour-over coffee that Jin-guk makes. I make great pour-over coffee. What? Anyway, I was so surprised when I saw that post. Min-su, our dogs almost look identical. - My gosh! - I do see a bit of resemblance. Not just a bit. They look like twins. See this part where the hair has turned white? Even that's identical. Min-su, how about you go upstairs and talk to Sang-ho about it? You love dogs and have had Runie for years, so I'm sure the two of you can relate to each other. Oh, good point. Shall I try? Yes, you should. All right. I'll go see if I can talk to him. - Okay. - I'll be right back. Dad, leave me alone! Hi, Sang-ho. My name is Min-su. I'm your dad's acquaintance. Can I come in for a minute? Why do you need to come in? I have a golden retriever, too. His name is Runie. What's your dog's name? Jung-ho. I see, Jung-ho. That sounds like a person's name. Did you come up with the name? Yes, both our names end with "Ho". Because he's my little brother. I see. I guess you have no siblings. Not anymore. I'm an only child too. So I was very lonely as well when I was growing up. You were probably not lonely at all when Jung-ho was around. Right. I know what it's like. But you see, Sang-ho... I heard all dogs go to heaven. I'm sure Jung-ho is in heaven now, watching over you even at this very moment. So if you're this devastated, Jung-ho will be very sad, don't you think? He'd want to console you right by your side, but he can't do that now. You don't want Jung-ho to be sad, right? I don't want him to be sad. Sang-ho. I want to show you something. Can I come in for a minute? Hold on. Oh, here. This is my dog. Jung-ho! It's not Jung-ho. He's my dog, Runie. What the hell are you talking about? Oh, I mean... He's not Sang-ho. What I'm saying is, he's not Jung-ho. No! This is my dog. Sang-ho, this is my dog, Runie. No, this is Jung-ho. It's my dog. No, he's my dog. He's my dog! Runie is my dog, you little brat! Jung-ho is my dog, you little brat! - He's my dog. - I said, he's mine! - He's my dog. - No, he's my dog. - He's mine! - No, he's mine! - No, he's mine. - My dog! - No! - No! He's my dog! Who's this? My son. He's learning special martial arts. That's very cool. He's really good. Don't say anything, mister. Just don't. I mean it. Don't! I will kill you! He is my dog! You little... I'm much older than you... Gosh! - That doesn't matter. - It went everywhere. My wife... - Sang-ho. - Get him out of there. What's he talking about? Huh? Hey! What happened... Gosh, I get that he's tired, but how could he fall asleep here? Hey, I told you to persuade the kid. Why are you sleeping here? My dog... I thought you were sleeping. I'm not crazy. Why would I fall asleep in a stranger's house? Right, you're not that crazy. Anyway, what do you think? Aren't they the best candidate? I'm not sure. They live close to you, and they used to have a golden retriever. There are different levels of compatibility between dogs and their owners. I don't think they're compatible. - Why not? - Think about it. Sang-ho will expect Runie to act exactly like Jung-ho. But Runie is Runie. He's not Jung-ho. Runie has his own likes and dislikes, but Sang-ho won't understand that. Then Runie and Jung-ho... I mean, neither Runie nor Sang-ho will be happy. Hey, didn't you say you put this place up for sale? Yeah, but it hasn't sold yet, so I'm still waiting on it. But that window is open. Hey, it's so dusty in here. I'll go upstairs quickly and close the window. Mom. Are you all right? Mom... Mom, wait. Just a moment. Mom, please... Just a moment. Mom, no... Mom. Runie... Runie... Runie. I didn't even get to say goodbye to Mom. What do I do? Runie... After I graduated from college, I wanted to win the literary contest and become a novelist. I wasn't even earning a single penny, but I whined to my mom every day about how stressed out I was. I did that for four years. All the stress I had caused her... became cancer cells... and killed her. So I told myself... that I would never cause pain to those I love again. But Seong-gyeong... She has been taking medication because of me. I had no idea. I'm a worthless jerk. - Gosh, what a moron. - Hey. Hey, you'll hurt yourself. Don't do that. Hey, stop it. - I should just die! - Min-su. Min-su! Hey. I'll make sure we find a good new home for Runie, and you and Seong-gyeong will get married without any problems. So don't cry. Okay? Okay. Why are you crying again? - My eyes are burning. - What? My eyes are burning! I can't see anything! Excuse me! Can we get a clean towelette over here? Bye, take care. - Get home safely. - Bye! - Will do. - Bye. - Ouch! - Sorry! I'm sorry, Min-su. - I'm heavy, aren't I? - No, not at all. I gave you a piggyback ride every day when you were little. - How about now? - Hey! Stop kicking. Keep your legs still, you brat. This isn't because you're heavy. It's because I'm drunk now. That's why, okay? "MY PUPPY" Sorry, I just woke up. Are you all right? I have a headache. Do you remember calling me last night crying and saying sorry over and over? I'm sorry. I drank way too much with Jin-guk last night. That's okay. But I want you to tell me whenever you're stressed out about something. We'll become a family soon, you know. A family must overcome challenges and hardships together. Don't take it all on yourself. Okay, I won't. I have to head in now. I'll call you when I arrive. Okay. Love you, babe. Love you more. My second uncle lives in Paju, and he has a small garden. Right. A black dog named Rey lives in that garden. That dog kind of looks like Runie, but it's a bit smaller and has shorter hair. Oh, it must be a Labrador retriever. Labrador... I see. This is good. You don't want coffee? I'm not a fan of these beans. Hey, do you think Runie and Rey can become friends? Every dog has a different personality. So it's hard to tell unless they meet. But I have to say, Paju is pretty far. I know. But clearly, there are advantages to this option. First, he's an experienced retriever owner. And Runie and his dog may become friends. The pros might outweigh the cons. Let's go and see. Good boy. - Good boy. - Is that like Runie's seat belt? Yeah. Hi! Runie, play with Rey. Go! Go play. What do you think? Do you think it'll work out? I think they'll become friends soon. Would you be willing to send Runie to Uncle if he agreed to adopt him? I think he'll be okay here. Okay, good. Give me a minute. Jin-guk. Best of luck. Thanks. I got this! Good luck. - Uncle! - Hi, Jin-guk. Good to see you. What? Did you get your eyebrows tattooed? Oh, I asked them to make it last long, and they made it look so dark. They'll easily last for ten years. You think so? That'd be great. - Come this way. - Okay. Min-jeong's doing well, right? Yes. She's pregnant with her second child. Congratulations. Is it a boy or a girl? A girl. But I think I should go to Boston soon to see her. I'll find out more once I get there, but Min-jeong has preeclampsia, and it's quite serious. Both Min-jeong and her baby may end up in critical condition. My wife flew there last week to look after our first grandchild, and my flight's next week. But I have no idea how long I'll end up staying there. I'm thinking six months at the least. I may end up staying there a little over a year. Then what about Rey? Who will look after him? For real? That's why I wanted to see you today. You're the only person I can trust, you know. I'll return as soon as Min-jeong gives birth without any problems. Help me out just this once. All right. Thanks, Jin-guk. Don't mention it. You've helped me out so much. I should help you, of course. Thankfully, my cousin knows a lot about retrievers. I'll ask him for help and take good care of Rey. All right. Thanks a lot. No problem. By the way, your aunt and I had a talk. The money we borrowed you to open that caf√©. Do you still owe us 30,000 dollars? You don't need to pay us back. Why not? We didn't say anything because you insisted on paying us back. Your aunt said you can just use the money to look after Rey. Still, I should pay you back... No, you'd better do as I say. It'll help us feel more at ease. All right, then. Gosh, I'm relieved now. I bet you knew about it from the get-go. Hey! I'd never lie to you. You lie to me every day! That's not true! Only once in a while. You've done this to me many times. What will you do now? Hey, I'm all flustered too right now. Why are you flustered? This is all your fault! Okay! Let's cool off for a moment. We're going to the riverside park. I promised Runie I'd play with him there. Runie! Come here, Runie! Rey, this won't take long. Hold on, okay? Doesn't this feel nice? "JOO A-MIN" "IN JEJU" Why are you so handsome? Did you get your good looks from me? Let's see. Good boy! "MY FAVORITE RED BEAN BUN" It feels so nice, doesn't it? "Damian"? Good boy. We're all done. Feels nice, right? Damian? "DAMIAN" "BAKERY" Hey! Rey, where are you going? Hey! Runie, get back here! God, what a mess! We won't find a house in Seoul with a garden like A-min's where dogs can run around and play. I get that, but we don't know this person at all. That's why I'm saying we should meet her. You said yourself that the dogs here look happy. I think that's a good sign. If she loves and cares about her dogs this much, she's probably a good person, don't you think? I don't know. Let's meet her, okay? We can't solve anything by just sitting here and racking our brains. If it works out, that's great. If it doesn't, we'll find another solution. I told you I'd take care of this no matter what. Let's go there and meet her. When? We can go tomorrow. Tomorrow? Don't you have to work? I can take the day off. What about you? I can too, but don't you think we're rushing this too much? If I take Rey home now, my landlord will kick me out. I was just helping you out up until this morning. But now, this is an urgent matter to me as well. I'm really sorry. No, it's okay. I was also hoping someone in the family would take care of Runie. I think you made the right decision. Okay. But if we want to fly to Jeju, the dogs will have to fly cargo. I don't think Runie can do that because he's afraid of loud noises. Then how about a road trip? And we can take the ferry. - A road trip? - After you get married, we won't really be able to take a trip like this together. It'll be nice. Let's eat sashimi when we get to Jeju. My treat! Then are we going to eat wild-caught longtooth grouper? Just eat whatever I buy you. Good boy. Min-su, what breed is that dog? Oh, that's an Afghan hound. That breed is rare in Korea. My gosh! Wow, what a cool dog. Hey, what's your name? Careful, you'll drop your phone. Hey! What did I say? Jin-guk, your screen is all cracked anyway. Just get a new phone, okay? - Min-su. - Yeah? It's rare for me to apologize to anyone this sincerely. I'm really sorry! For what? - Hold on. Hey! - This is unbelievable. Hey! It's already shattered! - I saw it! - Shut up! Okay! I'll shut up! Damn you! If you see it, you'll just get more upset. - Hey, calm down. It can't be undone. - Damn it! Why did you use my phone? I can't see anything on mine. - Hand it over. - Why? - I'm going to smash it. - Mine's already smashed. Just hand it over! You're so dead! - What's wrong? What is it? - Runie. What is it? What's the matter, Runie? What did you see? Gosh! Hey, look! What is it? Look at this. - My gosh. - What do we do? What kind of a lunatic abandoned these puppies here? Hey, can you see if there's an animal shelter nearby? My gosh. "PUREUN ANIMAL SHELTER" Hello. They've been weaned. Looks like they were fed this morning. Would you be able to keep them here? I'm sorry, but we're filled to capacity at the moment. You'll have to find another shelter. Where should I take them? I'll be honest. People rarely adopt mixed-breed dogs. So even if you take them to another shelter, they'll most likely end up being put down. You mean they'll be euthanized? Last year, we had a cocker spaniel that was pregnant. So I posted on social media that we were expecting cocker spaniel puppies, and so many people were interested in adopting them. But when the puppies were born, I realized they were mixed-breeds. When people found out about it, they all changed their minds. I mean, I get it. But all living beings are precious. How could they... Anyway, that cocker spaniel had five puppies. I held out for as long as I could to get them adopted. But the holding period came to an end, so I had to put them down. All five of them? The mother too. To be honest, we have some puppies that came in with their moms. I have no idea what will happen to them. Do you know if there are any shelters in the area where the situation is a little better? It's probably all the same, more or less. Why did you bring them back? She said all of them would die if we leave them here. Don't they look after abandoned dogs here? Yes, they do. But mixed-breeds rarely get adopted, so they all get put down in the end. Even so, you can't just bring them back. What are we going to do with them? That person in Jeju might agree to take them. But we won't find out until we get there. What if she says no? Just take them back. But how... I can't do it. I feel as though I'm the one killing them. I guess this master negotiator should step in. It was on my way home. I suddenly heard a dog cry, so I ran over there. A dog was hung on a tree, getting beaten up by those men. My goodness. I kicked them all out and got him down from the tree, but his ribs were all broken already. He could barely breathe. But I guess he remembered me feeding him a few times in the past. When he saw me, he started wagging his tail. Had I come to his rescue sooner, he wouldn't have died that day. That experience traumatized me, so I thought I should do something, anything. That's why I started taking in abandoned dogs one by one. And ten years have passed since then. As the number of dogs grew, people started sending donations. At the moment, we have about 200 dogs. But we still need a lot of things. Most importantly, we don't have enough space. So we have no choice but to put down the ones that have been here the longest. That dog too. They'll pick him up at one to put him down. When we found him abandoned, we noticed that he had been declawed. What? Why? Some people who live in apartments... declaw their dogs because of the noise they hear when their dogs scratch the floor. What? But isn't that really painful? Yes, it hurts a lot. They at least shouldn't abandon them after doing such a thing. Gosh, I feel so bad for them. Would you like to hold him? Oh, sure. It's okay. Good boy. You're so sweet. Here. Why is he suddenly making that snoring sound? Because he's excited. He's so happy that someone's holding him. Gosh. Don't cry, buddy. Hey, you're so excited. He seems very happy. Are you happy? Since you're all white, I'll call you Baeksuk. And you. Let's see. My gosh, you kind of look like Jin-guk. Then you can be Enemy. Sorry, not Enemy. Guk... Guksu? How about Guksu? She gave me some food for the puppies. Some leashes too. What's going on? What? We should get going. What's that under your shirt? Didn't you say you were a master negotiator? Hey, look at this cutie. Don't you want to know what his name is? No, I don't. His name is Thor, the son of Odin. The God of Thunder. Loki's stepbrother. He was supposed to be put down at one, so I had no choice! And having one more dog now won't even make a difference. You're in no position to yell at me now! This little guy loves me. He kept doing that, so what was I supposed to do? Just let him die? You brought four! I only brought one. Is that important now? Hey, we have to persuade A-min no matter what. Otherwise, these dogs are all screwed. Okay. I'll get on my knees if I have to, so don't worry. You'd better. I'll do it if I have to. Get on your knees as soon as you meet her. Can we get going? "AIRBNB" "AIRBNB" Feels nice, right? Hey, the coffee we had yesterday... I use the same beans every day, but it definitely tasted different when you brewed it. It was really cool. The bean determines only 50 percent of the taste of your coffee. The other 50 percent is determined by the barista. I really hope you can open another caf√© down the road. I bet that one will go bust too. That's because you refused to sell iced Americanos. During the colder months, you made up to 10,000 dollars monthly. You see, I didn't want it to be just like any other caf√©s. I wanted to specialize in pour-over coffee. The pour-over method brings out all the flavors and aromas of the beans. Adding ice to that is like locking down the aromas and flavors that I worked hard to bring out. Does that make sense to you? But still, people want iced Americanos. I don't want to compromise. Pour-over coffee is my dream, and I believe in it. Hey, I worked so hard in that sweat-filled basement gym for over ten years, selling my conscience and soul, but I really don't want to sell my dream. If I give up and even sell that, I'll have no reason to exist. I'll be nothing, really. I brought it up because you look happy when you're making coffee. - Oh, gosh. - My goodness. - Here, have some. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Have fun. Thank you for this! - This looks so good. - It does. It's so sweet! Hey, I couldn't afford to buy you anything for your old caf√©. But if you open a new one, I'll totally buy you something. Hey, thanks. It's the thought that counts. - Let's eat. - I'm serious. Tell me what you need. This is so good. - It's really good. - I know. Have more. Hey, come out. Now! Why won't you listen? Come out and eat! Are you not going to come out? My gosh. Sir! - Sir! - Come out already! - Why won't you listen? - What's the matter? This stupid dog won't eat. Still, you can't do this. Then what am I supposed to do? It won't listen to me. Sir, the dog can't eat because it's kept on this heavy chain. My gosh, it can barely move. This way, it can't run away. I'll go bring a lightweight leash. I have one in the car. I don't need one! I'll just fatten it up and sell it. You'll sell it? To whom? What do you think? To a restaurant that serves dog meat! Come out! Hey! You little... I'll buy the dog. You can sell it to me, okay? Then pay me first. How much? I'd like at least 100 dollars. I'll go get the money. Thor! Good morning, Thor. My sweet Thor. It's okay. Come here. Come here. Come here, sweetie. It's okay. Come here. Come on. Yes, come here. That's it. Thor. Who's that? I don't know. I saw that old man hitting this dog with a broom. Why? He wanted to fatten it up and sell it to a restaurant, but it wouldn't eat. What are we going to do if A-min doesn't want to take the dogs? What do we do? I asked you first. I'm asking you because I don't know. I wouldn't have asked you had I known the answer. Why would you ask me if you didn't have the answer? Because you're wiser than I am. Oh, I see. Gosh... Honestly, I don't know what to do. When you don't know what to do, you must stay positive. Hey, want to do the arm cross? It's been a while. Are you a kid? Don't you think we're a little too old for that? Right. I was just kidding. Do you guys want to do it too? What's your name? Let's see. How about Princess? Look at all this dirt coming out. My gosh. Doesn't this feel so nice? "MOKPO - JEJU" "CAR FERRY TICKET OFFICE" Come on. All right, go on in. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, we have a lot of dogs. - Hello. - Come here, guys. Lime's old. I was told he only has about three months left to live. The doctor said swimming in the sea and walking on the beach will help alleviate the pain because it's easier on the joints. That's why I rented a beachside house. I want to do my best to make Lime happy until he breathes his last. That can't be an easy decision. No. I run an online shopping mall. In that industry, you lose all the customers once you take a break. And it's not easy to get the ball rolling again. So I thought long and hard but concluded that nothing matters more than making sure Lime stays happy until his last moment. Otherwise, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Be good to them while you still can. Me? Yes, they grow up so quickly. Oh, they're not my dogs. I'm just babysitting them. They seem to think of you as their daddy. What? No way. Do you want a photo with them? Sure. - Get closer. - Okay. Look at the camera. Look here! Nice. - I think it'll look very nice. - Thanks. "QUEEN MARY" "MOKPO - JEJU" Hey, are we almost there? I think we'll get there in about ten minutes. Okay, sounds good. "DAMIAN" "BAKERY" Hello! Hello. Isn't there a lady who lives around here with many dogs? I think she has a huge garden. It looked like she comes to this bakery often. Oh, the house with a lot of dogs. It must be... Where did she go? Sorry! Ma'am! - Go away! - Ma'am! Don't follow me! - I just want to ask you something! - No! Ma'am! Why is he so fast? Wait! Darn it. Gosh! Why did I wear sandals? - Ma'am, just a moment! - Don't follow me. Ma'am! I'm not a bad person! Please hear me out! What do you want? By any chance, are you A-min? I take care of things for her. Who are you? I see. I'm visiting from Seoul. My cousin and I have some dogs. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, we have to find someone to look after the dogs. And I happened to stumble upon A-min's Instagram account. All her dogs looked so beautiful and happy, so we were hoping to leave our dogs with her. We think our dogs will be very happy there. So we drove for hours and took the ferry to come here. Well... Please, help me out. Please help us. I understand what you're trying to say. But I need to see how she's feeling. I'll check in with her and call the bakery, so please wait. Sure! That's no problem. Does it taste good? Look at you. Here. Here you go. How many cats live here? We have four cats. One's just visiting. I see. The customers adore these cats. I see. By the way, that lady named A-min... Have you seen her? I saw her briefly when she was in the car. What was she like? I'd say she looked like she was in her early 20s? And she was very pretty. Rumor has it that she's some business magnate's only daughter. She has some incurable disease and moved here to recuperate. - Welcome. - Hello. This gentleman here takes care of all our dogs. I see. Hello. He'll watch the dogs for you, so you can leave them here. Then can I just take Runie? Why? I should introduce her to Runie. Will that be okay? All our dogs are socialized, so they should be okay, but will Runie be all right? Yes, Runie will be fine. Then let's go meet her since she's feeling okay now. Let's go, Runie. Come on. Jump. Wow, look! Where are all these dogs from? There's an animal shelter in Jeju. If there are any dogs that need to be put down, we bring them here. A-min loves dogs. Hey, these dogs are all from a shelter. It looks like they're very well cared for. How many dogs do you have? About 40. My gosh. A-min has Parkinson's disease. I see. She just took her medication, so she's feeling okay now. But her condition may suddenly worsen if she's stressed, so please be careful. - Okay. - We'll keep that in mind. Excuse me. "WALKING TO SAMARKAND BERNARD OLLIVIER" Hello. Please take a seat. Come on, Runie. Let's sit down. Runie, sit down. Good boy. Go ahead. Thank you for meeting with us even though we came unannounced. I'm Yoo Min-su, and this is my cousin, Kim Jin-guk. My childhood nickname was Kimchi-guk. Are you crazy? What's with that lame joke? Sorry, it just came out. I'm sorry. I'm marrying my girlfriend of three years. But I recently found out that she had been hiding her dog allergy and that she had been taking medication for it all this time. I truly love my girlfriend, and I really love my dog as well. So I was really torn, and I resented myself for having to do this. But now that I'm here in Jeju, experiencing this beautiful breeze and the sweet scents... of grass and flowers in your garden, I'm really hoping my dog can run around and play here. It looks like all the dogs here are so well cared for. The soil in your garden is so soft, and there are many dogs here. So I think he won't be lonely here even if I'm not around. I'm sorry to ask you this when we just met, but if my dog can live here, I promise you that I'll return the favor. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. We also have a smaller retriever. Can we leave him here as well? They're friends, and they can't live without each other. As for that dog, I'll come back to pick him up in about six months. We also have six puppies, and they're so cute. Okay. Thank you! My dog's name is Runie. - Please take good care of him. - I don't need to know his name. But how will you call him if you don't know his name? They come to me when I give them treats. So you don't know any of their names? They'll die anyway, so why bother? "They'll die anyway"? What do you mean by that? They'll die. Everything dies eventually. Then what do you normally do when your dogs die? My staff bury them in our backyard. So are you not sad even when your dogs die? Why should I be sad? Then who will cry for your dogs when they die? They were all abandoned anyway. They'd already be dead if they didn't come here. Here, at least they can be happy until they die. That's enough, isn't it? If you expect more, I'd call it greed. Do you want me to treat your dogs like my family? You'll never find anyone who loves you like your own family does. And if you must send a family member away to start a new family, then it wasn't a real family to begin with. You must be together no matter what happens. That's what a family is. If you want to leave them here, you can. My staff will make sure they won't starve. I have nothing more to say. What should we do? Maybe it's because my dad passed away before I was born. I always wanted to get married young and start my own family. After my mom passed away, that urge grew even more. Perhaps that's why I got anxious and rushed to get married. A-min is right. A family must stick together no matter what happens. Runie is 11 now. So if he doesn't fall ill and lives long, I'd say he has about three years left. I'll talk to Seong-gyeong... and try to postpone the wedding. I'll take care of Runie. You? I can't leave Rey with A-min anyway. If he gets hurt, I can't hold them accountable because they don't even care to know the dogs' names. I'll explain the situation to Uncle so I can stay at his place while looking after Rey. How will you commute to work from Paju? I'll just quit and take a little break. I hated the job but kept it so I could pay back Uncle, but he said I wouldn't need to pay him back if I looked after Rey. Seriously? Yeah. I'll look after Runie and Rey. And when Uncle returns from the US, I'll talk to him and make sure Runie can stay at his place. You liked his place too. Yeah, I'd love that. All right, this is actually good. I needed a little break anyway. After my caf√© went bust, I was so upset... that I lived as if my life was over. I have more than 40 years left to live. I'll take out my rent deposit and try to hold out while thinking about what I want to do next. Anyway, I'm keeping my promise that I'd take care of this. Thanks, Jin-guk. But what about Thor and Princess? They've gotten so close to Runie and Rey already. And what about these puppies? I even named them. I don't know. - Hello. - Come on in. You have many dogs. We saw on your blog that dogs were allowed, so we booked it. Is it okay? Yes, it's fine. Please come in. Thank you. Let's go. Thor! Hey, Rey! Go inside. - Go on in. - Hold on. I'll wash that bowl. It's okay. I've had dogs too, so I don't care. You don't have one now? I've had a few dogs. But when I had to let them go, it was so devastating. So I've decided to never get a dog again. Min-su! Okay! Could you watch them for a second? Sure. What are you doing? Hey, you should try this too. It feels like the doctor fish! What the heck are you doing? You didn't even wash your face! - Gosh! Come here. - This feels so nice. Hey! - Hey, that's dirty. - My gosh. I feel like I slathered on moisturizer. Hey, Min-su. Let's just take all of them. For real? How are you going to look after all of them? Well, I had this idea when I saw those cats at that bakery. Why don't we open a caf√© together and keep them all there? Like those dog caf√©s? But not the kind of caf√© where customers bring their dogs. It will just be our dogs. The customers will have coffee and play with our dogs. Nice. I think it's a great idea. Then will you add ice to your pour-over coffee? No. Not a chance. What if the place goes bust again? Hey, why didn't you buy an espresso machine for your old caf√©? I didn't need it because I specialize in pour-over coffee. But the machine will allow you to make iced Americanos without ruining your pour-over coffee. Well, that's true. But good commercial espresso machines are very expensive. How much are they? They're really expensive. How much? A couple thousand dollars? Hey! The good ones cost well over 20,000 dollars. All right. I'll buy you one. I'll pay for it in installments or something. - But why? - I told you. I want to buy something for your new caf√©. And I'll help you out on weekends, for free. I wonder if Seong-gyeong will be okay with that. She will be, if I beg her on my knees. Try it now. You need to sit like this. This angle is important. It makes you look more sincere. I've done it a lot, so I know. - Like this? - 45 degrees. Try to look devastated. I'll take it now. Hey, I should leave quietly when Runie is busy playing. On Friday, I'll come right after work and help you with your move. Runie... Runie, I'm sorry. Give me your sweet paw. "BABE, CAN YOU MEET ME HERE AT ARAM-RO 12-GIL 29?" "ARAM-RO 12-GIL 29" What's that? I found some flowers while cleaning the garden, so I made it for you. This must be the house where you and your mother used to live. Yes. Babe, how about we fix up this house so the two of us and Runie can live here together? I'll put up a fence from here to all the way there and make sure Runie stays inside the fence. You'll keep Runie outside? Yes. I'll build a big house for him by the storage over there. But he'll be cold in winter. Golden retrievers have a high cold tolerance. They don't do well with hot weather. But I'll build a nice house for him so he can stay cool in summer. I think... I'll be okay with that. Really? Thank you! You couldn't find anyone to look after Runie? It's not that. Jin-guk offered. Then why... I just thought a family should stick together no matter what. You made the right decision. I want to see inside. No, I haven't finished cleaning the house. I want to see it. Come on, show me. I'll help you clean. No... This is the living room. My old room is upstairs. This room is small. That's the master bedroom. This was your mother's room, right? Yeah. I have to say, you're so sweet, compassionate, and warmhearted. Otherwise, you would've already sent Runie away. And you wouldn't have decided to move back to this house. Now that I know how brave you are, I trust that you'll always protect our little family no matter what life throws at us. I really believe that. So, I'm going to protect you in this house. We'll make... lots of happy memories together in this house, so you won't be sad anymore. We'll have a baby in this house and live here with Runie as a family. We'll be happier together. Give me your hand. Here. Here! Baeksuk! Come here! Runie! Runie! "MONGMOONG"
