Separate the live ones from the dead ones. Jimmy, yeah, it's me. I asked for 30 girls and you send me 17. And half of them are looking dead. This is not how I do business. I already sold them to our friends in Romania. I'll tell you what, I can't even unload these girls, not even to my new customers, so this is what you're gonna do, You're gonna send me 30 girls, good ones. And when I say good, I mean fresh, clean ones. I got a reputation and I'm not gonna let you mess up with my business. If you can't deliver, I'm gonna call everyone else who can. Listen, Jimmy, if I have to, I'll call the Russians. It may cost us a little more, but at least they can give me a decent consignment. Sure we go back, but not so far back that... She's still alive! Hey, hold it! No. No! Please, no. Let me go! Let go off me! I want to break free. Let me go! No! Please, let go off me! No! No! I wanna be free, please, let me go. Please! Shivam, let's go. There's a problem. Room No. 203. Room is booked in name of Ronnie, that's why no one stopped him. Hey, Shivam, it is good that you are here. See, look at her. Take care of this shit. Hey, listen. Listen. This is not my fault. Ask him. Hey, tell him! Bitch was smiling while talking here. God knows, what happened to her on the bed. Started abusing. Scratched me like a cat. Put it in her. Take care of her. Tell Malik Uncle it's my fault. I was high. Shivam. Please. Bastard! Whom are calling? Are you calling the police? Put the phone down! Put the phone down! Hey. Tell him to put the phone down. Look, I have four more bullets. Will put two in you and two in him. Understand! Shivam, No! Shivam, leave him alone. Shivam, listen to me! Listen to me! Hey! Hey! Stop it, Shivam! That's enough! Leave him. Shivam, have you lost your mind? Enough, Shivam! What are you doing? Leave him, Shivam! Local news. The Hongkong Police Department arrested... a Manoj Malik aka Munna suspected rapist and murderer of Sylvia Thomas. A hotel employee of Hongkong International. This way, sir. ...son of local businessman, Mr. Rajan Malik, and nephew of Borat Malik, the owner of Hong International Hotel. The Malik family moved to Hongkong about 12 years ago from India. It is believed that Maliks were involved in various illegitimate businesses and activities... If you want to size a person... then find out, who are his enemies. Size of enemy... indicates his size. You are progressing well. Will you have food? Auditors were telling that business of your one hotel is seven times more than business of all my hotels. Whereas, we in our hotels have casinos and invite dancers from all over the world, make the girls dance. But still your hotel is number one. Someone has rightly said, when the plant of goodness begins bearing fruit, then it should not be fertilized with evil. -Sorry, sir. You can't go. -Get out of my way! What was the need? You did a bad job by getting Munna arrested. Understand. Dad, whenever I try to do business with Rajan Uncle, Shivam... Don't interfere in my business relationships. You are a servant. Behave like a servant. -Otherwise...-Otherwise, what? What? Do you understand business? You booked a room for Munna in the hotel, in your own name? Papa, listen to me... Hotel belongs to Shivam, business is also Shivam's. In future, neither go to that hotel without my knowledge, nor talk to Shivam impolitely. Got it? -Understood? -Yes. What do I tell you of one's pain, whose tears, before reaching the eyes, hesitate a hundred times. I have never seen you drinking like this. Are you all right? Come. I'll take you inside. Come. -I have to talk to you. -Yes. There is a girl. Reema. She is a Pakistani. She is no ordinary girl. That is why I have kept her hidden from the world. I had gone to meet her a few days ago. Talked to her a lot. Loved a lot. But when she was with me on the bed, then for the first time I realized, that while I possess her body, she is standing far away from me. If this girl starts meeting someone else, or begins to love someone else, then I will not be able to live, Shivam. I am going to London for two weeks. This is her address. Keep an eye on her. Follow her. And find out whether I am the last destination of her life, or there is someone else too. If it is merely my suspicion, it is good. But if it is true, then call me. Goodbye. Yes? I have been sent by Mr. Malik. Will you please speak a little louder? Mr. Malik has sent this parcel for you. Oh, hi. No, can't come right now. No, I will take some more time. Yeah, I will be ready. One minute. Will you hold, please? -Excuse me. -Yes. You may go. Mr. Malik sent a car for you. No. I will not need a car. I will talk to Mr. Malik myself. Yes. -This my card. -No. No. I will not even need this. Okay. Listen. Well, give me your card. Who knows when I may need this. -Goodbye. -Khuda Hafiz. You are weird. Leave without saying Khuda Hafiz. Goodbye. I'm sorry. -Leave it. I'll handle. -I'm sorry. Please, leave it. -What is this? -I am so sorry. -Sorry, friend. -Waiting for long. That's enough. Let's go. Somewhere out there I know there is a someone Who is waiting just for me, Mahiya He's gonna set me free, Mahiya Whose eyes are wet for me alone There has to be someone, Mahiya I am waiting, Mahiya The one in whose life I'm the only one missing The one who stays restless for me, Mahiya One who dotes on me, Mahiya One who is connected with me in all things One whose love is immeasurable One who is faithful than faith, Mahiya How long must I keep dreaming a fantasy? Why can't you be part of my reality? Taking him, I weave the dreams of life I shall weave them with sparkling colors I think of him often in my thougths He is somewhere, that partner of mine\N Mahiya That lover of mine, Mahiya Somewhere out there I know there is a someone Who is waiting just for me, Mahiya He's gonna set me free, Mahiya Kabir, sending some numbers through SMS. Find out, whom they belong to. They have to be monitored 24 hours. Shivam, I already have so much work. Is it essential to find these numbers? Do you ever work without question? -Okay. -Please. I know that he is gonna be my destiny It's all the part of Cupid's conspiracy I've been watching the path For him to arrive Hidden from all and in my heart Just as my heart has chiseled him I will find such a friend, Mahiya I have firm belief, Mahiya Somewhere out there I know there is a someone Who is waiting just for me, Mahiya He's gonna set me free, Mahiya The one in whose life I'm the only one missing The one who stays restless for me, Mahiya One who dotes on me, Mahiya One who is connected with me in all things One whose love is immeasurable More faithful than faith, Mahiya -Bye. Good night. -Bye. Good night. -Bye! -Bye! -Hello. -Guess, who is back? Back again. Shady is back. -Hello. -Hey. Hey. Guess, who is back? -Who is this? -Guess, who is back? Hello, I'm back. And so is my friend Johnny. Wait. Wait. Wait. You will send me to jail? You will send me to jail? Will send me to jail! You will send me to jail! Scoundrel! You scoundrel! Going to kill you, bugger. Listen! Munna's bodyguard has taken the blame of Sylvia's murder. Since he has come out of jail, he has made my life hell. Keeps calling me asking, "Where's Shivam, where's Shivam?" I tried to explain to uncle, it is a small issue, let it go. He doesn't understand. After all, we haven't committed rape and murder. But, no. But, no. That scoundrel, Shivam! That rascal, Shivam! Look. Listen to me. Call uncle and apologize. No point stretching the issue. Listen to me. Son of a... Uncle's phone. You handle him. Make him understand. -Shivam. -What you have done is not good. Say whatever you want to. Not like eunuch, over the phone say it to my face. What did you say? I handled it. What have you done? Shivam! Shivam, listen to me! What do you think of yourself? Can shoot anyone? Can abuse anyone you like? What is your status? Your arrogance, your attitude... works only because my father is your guardian. Once he removes his protection, then see what happens to you. Did you listen? Did you listen? The day Malik Sir stops protecting you, that day your dead body'll be in some gutter. This... This Rajan, Munna. Are they your family? Ronnie, they are using you, so that one day they usurp your father's business, and ruin you. If possible, try to understand. Khuda Hafiz. -Yes, sir. -Where are you? At home, something urgent? Now tell me, Shivam, in the fate of Bharat Malik, is there faith or betrayal? Don't you worry, Sir. As yet, there is nothing like you thought. Okay. At least... today I will get some sleep without drinking. Still for a few more days keep an eye on this girl . Heart of a woman and depth of an ocean, cannot be measured easily, Shivam. Such helplessness, such suffocation, such loneliness... Why does love give so much of pain? It's good, you don't have such problems. Goodbye. Make it run fast, faster, man! I'm trying, but it can't go any faster than this. This party we've stumbled upon is great, Shivam? -Isn't it? -That's correct. -What is happening? -What happened? Park it on the side. What timing! This had to happen now! -Come on. Hurry up. -Yes. I'm on it. Shivam, you get aside. -We're done. -Shivam, you go. They don't recognize me. If they see you, that'll be problem. You go. I am doing it. You go. You appear scared, Sir. No problem. Just free this bird. God will shower His blessings. What? Only for 20 rupees, Sir. One bird for only Rs. 20. Release it and then wish for whatever you want. God will definitely fulfill the wish. You won't get a better opportunity. Take blessings of the devotees of God. I neither need your birds, nor your God. Now, go away. -Are you an atheist, Sir? -Yes. That is a grave sin. Come on. You don't believe in God at all? This is a strange business model! First cage the birds and then make money by selling them, and then tell that free them and get blessings from God. Great, first yourself sin then, teach us of good deeds. Look, Sir, I have not committed any sin, someone else owns these birds. I only bring them to market and sell. Then just sell them. Why talk big about sin and grace? There is a need. Do you know? 1400 years ago, Paighambar Mohammad used to buy the slaves of Mecca and Medina at any price from their owners, and then used to free them. Now these days there are no slaves, so I sell these birds. So that people would buy them and free them for the sake of blessings. Are there such fools? Again nonsense. If you don't believe, then free a bird once and see, the grace of God will shower. When the peace washes over your soul, you will understand then. Shivam, why are you here? Let us go. Come. I looked for you everywhere and you are sitting here. You don't care. It's a question of 30 lakhs. What are you thinking? I am not talking nonsense. Yes? How are you? We have picked up the goods. Yes. In the boot. Yes, sir. We are just reaching. What a party we have found. Let's quickly hand the fatso to them... then 30 lakhs is ours. The world is ours! Do you know? 1400 years ago, Paighambar Mohammad used to buy the slaves of Mecca and Medina at any price and then used to free them. Now there are no slaves, therefore I sell these birds, So that people would buy them and free them for the sake of blessings. Again nonsense. If you don't believe, then free a bird once and see. Grace of God will shower. When the peace washes over your soul, you will understand then. With great style. What do you say, Shivam? What happened? Why did you stop the car? Why Shivam? What are you doing? Don't kill me. Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Go! Go, fatso. Spared your life. -Don't kill me. -Will not kill you. -What are you doing, Shivam? -Just listen. -Fatso, sit inside. -Go, go. Listen, man. I can give life for you, but he's worth 30 lakhs. Go away, fatso. -What is this? -You are my God. -Go, away. -You have spared my life. Thank you so much. Fatso, doesn't listen. Hey, fatso, where are you going? Stop! Stop! Shivam. What are you doing, buddy? What has taken over you? You will get us both killed. What's wrong with you today? -Leave it. You will not understand. -You've gone mad. Insane. I'm saved. I survived. You are my love You are my companion You are my religion You are my integrity You are my body You are my soul You are my heart You are my life Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord You are my destination You are my path You are in my dreams You are my close one You are in my mornings You are in my evenings You are in my memories You are in my promises Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord You are in my bangles And in my earrings You are in my drought You are in my monsoon You are in my robe You are in my veil You are in my dreams You are in my eyes Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord You are my speech, my worry You are the cause of pain And also the reliever You are my direction You are my worship You are my mosque You are my temple Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Oh, my Lord Hello. Hi. This is Reema speaking. You said, if I wanted something, I should call you. I did not want to trouble you, but there is an urgent need. Can you please come to Kowloon? Yes. When should I come? In half an hour. Hello. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Recognize? Didn't you recognize me? Me? You didn't recognize me? -Oh. -No. Try to remember. We have met before. Remember, you had spared my life? -No. I don't remember. -Siddharth. Siddharth Sood. I was taking food in my hotel. You had kidnapped me in Jodhpur. Do you remember? Yes. Sparing my life, you changed my life. Now I am CEO of God. I show the path to expats visiting here, who stray. Here. Here in the outskirts of Hongkong, there is monastery where I live. Some time pay us a visit. -Well. -Come some time. Hello. Excuse me. -Oh, you. -How strange you are, Shivam? I've been waiting for you and you are gossiping here. Oh. I am sorry. Sorry. You had to wait for him because of me. Excuse me. Don't know why we monks feel since we have renounced the world, everyone has. I am very happy to meet you. Very happy to meet you. Some time do come to meet. Come to meet. Sorry. Now tell me. What do you do? I am in charge of Malik Sir's hotel. I had given you my card. Yes. But he was saying that you are a very dangerous person. I mean, you get angry very soon. You said you have some urgent work with me. Actually, since Malik Sir has gone to London, I have started feeling this strange fear. And... you will not believe, but... I feel there is a ghost in my home. Ghost is not in your home, but in your mind. This ghost is called loneliness. Earlier, I also used to run away and threatened by the loneliness, then I befriended this loneliness, everything was fine again. If you ask me, you also befriend your loneliness. Well, if you say so, I will also try to befriend my loneliness. But it will take some time. For now, there is a way. What's that? I had a Talisman made here for myself... from a priest here. It might be ready now. I'll tie it to my door. I'll feel relieved that God is with me. He is protecting me. Will you please go in and bring it for me? I can't go in. I don't like buildings like temples, mosques and other places of worship. It'll be better if you keep me away from these. I'm sorry. But women are not allowed inside. And I need this Talisman badly. Now please. I request you, that you please go in and bring that Talisman. Yes. How may I help you? -Miss Reema sent me. -Yes. Yes. Priest is praying. Please have a seat. You can meet him as soon as he's done praying. Allah-u-Akbar. Aliyah, you take too long. Wait. Wait, Shivam. -Aliyah, what happened? -Leave me, Shivam. I pray for only ten minutes. You're all around me, distracting me. This is too much. Don't understand how you could remain in womb for nine months. Do you understand patience? When you are praying, I become too lonely. Don't know what happens to you. You get separated from me. I can't tolerate this separation. And today, you were having longer conversation with your God. You were not ready to get up. Today I was talking about something special. About you. -Complaining about me? -Not complaints. I was praying for you. I was asking God to make you a believer. To convert you from an atheist to a believer In whatever way or form you may believe in him, but do believe. -Are you listening, Shivam? -Yes. Listening. That is your only problem. Other than God, you understand everything. When there is no God, then what is there to understand? It is difficult to talk to you. I want that we meet even in after life. In heaven. Only those meet in heaven, who believe in God. Otherwise, we may be separated. Unnecessarily, I will have to live without you, Shivam. Aliyah, I only know this much that, the love which I have for you in my heart, that is my faith, my religion. That is my belief. You alone are my God. God forbid. Shivam. Stop it now. So far as God is concerned, if he exists and has made us meet, then one day he will make me a believer. When and how is left to him. -But Shivam listen... -Enough about God... Let us talk of something else. Let's talk of love. About me. About you. Aliyah, listen to... Aliyah. Listen to me, Aliyah. Aliyah. Where are you going? Where are you running away? You have crossed all limits of shamelessness. You are openly flirting with your lover. Shameless, you have the audacity to look me in the eye. Lower your eyes, you ill mannered brat! I love your daughter. Want to marry her. Whether you agree or not. Don't touch me. You belong to a different religion, and are a criminal too. Did he not tell you about his profession? He is a thief. He is a goon. And has been jailed twice for his crimes. Twice. You will marry my daughter? You will feed her with ill-gotten money? If you give the hand of your daughter in my hands, then right now, these arms, this life of crime... I am ready to quit. What do you talk of this arm and life, you will right now, be leaving this world. Aliyah! Shivam! Shivam! Aliyah! Aliyah! Your Talisman. If you don't mind, I may say something to you. Yes. Don't know why, but I feel that I have not seen a lonelier person than you in my life. Perhaps that ghost of loneliness is still around. You need this Talisman more than I do. Come on Torment me Come on Make me cry My heart Filled with sorrow My eyes Overflowing with tears Sighs Takes place Like A hurricane Come on Torment me Come on Make me cry Come on Come on Come on Come on Nothing will happen to you. Aliyah! Take away The sorrows The ones You have inflicted Take away The sorrows The ones You have inflicted Or else Tell me How to tolerate This sorrow Come on Torment me Come on Make me cry Come on Come on Come on Come on Aliyah! Aliyah! Aliyah! Aliyah! Aliyah! Your car was found in the middle of the road. Shivam, what happened? Shall we go? I am too sexy, Ayesha. Shivam. They have come to make peace. Relax. Munna, please. -Leave me, Ronnie. -They've only come to talk. I am going to break his jaw. -Please listen. -Leave me. Sit down. Please sit down. Sit. I am a businessman by profession. My job is not to kill people. But if someone interferes in my business, I kill him. You are interfering with my business. In my business. With my son. But I will forgive you. Because you are my brother's dog. But for that you have to apologize to me. Touch my feet. Apologize. -Hey, what are you doing? -Don't shoot. Hey. -What are you doing? -Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Shivam, do you know... What are you doing? What did I tell you, never come back. Never come here again. Did you understand? Lower the gun! Lower! Relax. My life is not so cheap that you can take it at will. You came to make peace, then listen carefully, never ever cross my path even in your dreams. Now, I give you and your cronies, give two minutes' time. You'll regret it. Give me a drink. Rajan is the brother of Malik Sir. I am not asking you touch feet and apologize. I am your friend. I am worried for you. But don't know why it feels as if these days you have returned to... Bye. Good night. See you. Bye. -Hey, hello. -Yes. Take your bag along. Or else you will trouble us poor people at midnight. -Bye. -Bye. It's very bad. Following someone, so late in night. Keeping an eye on them. This is a kind of theft. Well... I... Don't make excuses. I know you are following Malik Sir's orders. Now, what are the plans? You have followed me. If you are not yet satisfied, then sit in the vehicle overnight. If you want, I can send coffee for you. No. That won't be necessary. You go home. I am going. You go. -Yes, Kabir. -Where are you, Shivam? What is happening in club? Ronnie is here. Wants to meet. I do not want to talk to Ronnie. -But... -Tell him... Son of a bitch. Hello. Hello, are you all right? Shivam? Hello, Shivam, is there a problem? No. Some vehicle... What are you saying? Hello? Shivam what are you saying? Are you all right? -Hello. -I will call you later. But... I don't care, Reema. I've come from Pakistan just to take you back. Reema. For God's sake, Reema. Come back. Bilal, when Malik Sir brought me here then I compromised with my life. Now I am just his slave. I don't have dreams of freedom. Reema, you are sliding from one hell to another, and will not let this happen, Reema. Listen to me, come back to our country. Come back to your country. Why don't you understand? I can't place you in danger for my freedom. If Malik's people see us together... What? He'll kill me? But I can't see you enslaved. -Bilal. Those people... -Listen to me. We have just tonight. Tonight Shivam is not watching you. I... I... have booked two tickets for Lahore. Don't worry for me, Reema. Just pack your bag and come. No, not more than that. We're going to finish within four months. Wonderful. Yes, Shivam. Sir, you had imagined right. There is someone is in her life. Sir, his name is Bilal. He is with Reema right now at her house. They are planning to go to Pakistan, tonight. Kill her. Yes, sir? Kill her. Yes, sir. Reema! Open the door, Reema. The flight'll be leaving soon. Reema, let us not be late. No! No! No! No! Leave her! No! Shivam! No, Shivam. Shivam, no! Leave him, please! Shivam! No. No, Shivam! No! Shivam! Leave him! Shivam! No. Shivam, please leave him! Shivam! It's all my fault. Let him go. Please, listen to me. For God's sake. For your God's sake. Please. Please, let him go. Please, Shivam. Want to kill? Kill me. Kill me. But you cannot force me. I do not want such life of slavery. Freedom is my right. You can not take away my right. Leave us alone. Freedom is my right! Shivam! Shivam, for God's sake! Leave us alone! Please, let him go. No problem. Just free this bird. God will bless you. Shivam, please, Shivam. For God's sake. If you don't believe, once free a bird and see, God's grace will be showered. When the peace washes over your soul, you will understand then. Please. For God's sake, Shivam. Free us. Hello. Hello. Why did you not kill her? Why did bullet not pierce her? Speak up. I don't know, buddy. I fired six shots. That too from six feet. But none of them hit her. I don't know how I missed my target. My hands did not support me, buddy. As if... As if some miracle occurred. Miracle! I don't believe you are saying all this. You are an atheist? Since when have you started believing in all this? Nonsense. Shots did not hit. As if God came and saved her. Shivam, truth is that you did not want to kill her. Now, instead of her, both of us will die. Malik will not leave us. Now you tell, what should we do? Speak up. This is my bank account number. Kowloon Bank. It has eight lakh dollars. As soon as possible, withdraw them. We are going back to India, by first flight. Back? Being on the run again? Three years back we left our country and came here. We are doing fine here. We are earning well and you are saying go back. Why Shivam? For a Pakistani girl why should take enmity with Malik Sir? We are not going anywhere. And we will not endanger our lives over some chick. Are you getting it? I will kill her right now. In this friendship, I will take all decisions, not you. Will you do whatever I am saying? Yes or no? Yes or no? I'll give life for you, if you ask. Will reach airport in two hours with passports. You also reach airport with money. Where is Shivam? Why are you surprised seeing Kabir with me? He was only your friend, you were more than a son to me. I asked you to kill Reema. She is alive. Why? What happened between us, Shivam, that you took a stand against me. You know, Shivam, the river water flowing by the village sometimes begins entering the village during rainy season. Fearing rampage, we don't dare change direction of river but wait for the deluge to subside. I will give you one more chance. The work which you have left unfinished, finish it. No, Sir. I will not be able to do it. Now, you will have to kill Reema. You only will have to murder her. Only... you. Torture him till he realizes his mistake. Man grows only when he takes his own decisions. You did the right thing. If you remain like this, you'll go a long way in life. Can I come in? Ronnie. Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! No! Stop! Ronnie! No! Ronnie, stop. Ronnie! Do you know Gini? Once I developed a desire, to have a dog. I went to the market, many high bred beautiful dogs were available there. But no one was coming close to my heart. Suddenly I sighted a bitch, in a corner, sickly, dirty, unkempt, I liked it. Shopkeeper told me, "Don't take her. She is sick. She'll die." I did not agree. Brought her home. Cleaned her up. Nurtured her. Took care of her. Your... and Gini's story is one and the same. There is only one difference. She proved to be faithful. Congratulations! Congratulations, Shivam. You even defied death. But I don't understand, if it's your life or your pain that has increased? Hey, come here. Dig another pit. Let us bathe him. We'll have to bathe the dead body before burial. That's a gift for you. Dad has sent it. Open it. Open. Rascal. What's that saying in movies? Yes. Even after hitting rock bottom, the attitude is unchanged. Take it. Call your Malik Sir and apologize. You are a very lucky person. You've got another chance. Agree to what I am saying. Kill Reema. Understand. You've got ten minutes. Ten minutes. I know him. He is not gonna apologize. After ten minutes, we'll shoot him. Sorry, Sir. Yes, Sir. I'm sorry, Sir. I don't believe this. You apologized? When life is at stake... then principles of life change. "Yes, Sir! Yes, Sir!" Yes, Dad, I've... Kill him! -Hey, Kabir! -Dad. Dad! Rajan Uncle is here. So, heard Shivam has absconded. Ran away, scoundrel. I don't believe this. Had you given this job to me, he would have been dead by now. Because of him, you made... enemies of your own kin. All your cleverness failed. What... Silent! Child is right. I don't know how to recognize people. I am tired. Now, I can't handle this business alone. I need your support. In return, money and partnership. Whatever you ask for will be given. Just bring Shivam to me. Bring him. Alive. I want to kill him myself. Shivam is dead. Now just funeral remains. Now in Hongkong, only God can save him. No. Don't get up. Don't get up. Keep lying. Keep lying. Whatever happened. You are absolutely safe here. Take rest now. Why didn't I believe you? Why did I stay away from you? Life continued to torture me Only you gave me shelter Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Where is Bilal? Where? Look, my men will find him one of these days. It is better if you tell me yourself. Hurry up. Your silence will be your biggest enemy. Will throw you back at the same place, from where I purchased you. That is your right place. You will not have shortage of lovers. Seek one, and you will get thousands. They will use you so many times, that you will not be capable of loving anyone else. Wait for that day, right from today. I was asking God to make you a believer. Make you believer from an atheist. You may believe in him in any form or shape but believe, you must. I want that we may meet even after death. In heaven. And only those meet in heaven, who are believers. What is this suffering? What is this punishment? Why did I Remember you today? My days are restless My nights are restless Tell me what to do My own feet are shackles for me Please free me from myself Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old This evening you'll leave for India. I have made all arrangements. We have a monk, who owns a shipping company in Hongkong. He will help you reach Kolkata. Without passport. You don't worry, everything will be fine. What are you thinking? He gave up salvation and Nirvana to free people from pain and suffering. And here I am, who is running away from here, to save my life. How long will I run? How long will I hide carrying this cursed, meaningless life on my shoulders? What will I do with this life? Will keep wagging tail around some other Malik, like his dog. Do you know, Sood? When Aliyah's father had pointed the gun at me, I had dodged to save my life. I survived, but she did not. And I kept watching. I am doing the same thing today. Hiding like cowards. Running away. But how long will I run? Where will I run away? Are there places where her voice will not follow me? I have decided, Sood, I will not go back to India. -Oh. -I will not go. I have decided. But... Shivam, if you remain here, Malik's men will find you and kill. Because of fear of this death, I died before death. I have seen death very closely. For living fully, will have to die for someone. I will not die before uniting Reema and Bilal. This slave will earn freedom only after he frees both of them. Get inside. Bilal, sit inside. Get him. Don't let him go! Don't let him go! Bilal, stop! Bilal! Bilal, stop! Scoundrel, stop! Stop! Bilal, stop! Get him! What are you thinking? Kill me. Fire. These hands have not changed as much as you have, Kabir. I can't shoot you even if I want to. Free me from life, buddy. Shoot. I have broken our friendship. Please kill me. I'll make decisions, in this friendship. Not you! Do you understand? And I say that you will live. And help me. Take this boy in the temple of Siddharth Sood and wait for me. I will bring Reema there. Do you get it? Tell me, Kabir. Will you do this, yes or no? If you ask I'll even give my life for you. Go away! Dramatist, scoundrel! Crying like a girl. Now go away from here. And tell me where is Reema? Only Rajan and Munna know about it. I haven't come to kill you. Just tell me where is Reema. I will go away silently. The decision is yours. What is this? What is this Reema? My brother is prepared to ruin his life for her. You are prepared to die for her. What is this Reema? Is she better than these girls? You do one thing, I'll tell you where she is... bring her here. You bring her here. Bring her here. I will taste her. Kim! Will make Kim taste her. I will make entire Hongkong taste her. What? Don't kill me. I know nothing. Only Munna knows where she is. Don't kill me. Call Munna. Hey, scoundrel, don't be so hyper. I am reaching. Parking the vehicle. Yes, tell me. I have reached. Where are you? Scoundrel, how many times I have told you to leave dad and come to me. I have reached parking lot. Where are you? Go. Get away from here. I know it won't really matter to you, but let me say this. I have killed your father. You should go. To shoulder your father's dead body. You have to go, right? Go. But before that just tell me, where has Malik kept Reema? Malik Uncle's Macau house. Thank you! I'm in the house. You committed a grave mistake. By locking horns with me, huge mistake. Malik uncle... wants to see you alive. But I'm going to kill you. Now. My name is Prince. Yeah! And I am funky! Before dying would you like to hear a secret? Your Reema is in Malik Uncle's Chungking mansion. There she is going to be auctioned. And then all of us together, are going to use her, one after another. Okay. Time's up. Ready to die? Thank you. Thank you. -Hello, Shivam Bhai. -Bilal. -Shivam Bhai, arrangements are made. -Did you get both the passports? Yes, Kabir has given me both passports. Now you direct me. For now, reach Hongkong docks. I am reaching there with Reema. Shivam Bhai, no. Shivam Bhai, they will kill you. Nothing will happen to me. Listen to me. This is my promise, that you'll celebrate Eid in your country. No, Shivam Bhai. Don't go, Shivam, they will... Shivam, where are you? Hello? Hello, Shivam. Where are you? Hello. Hello, Shivam. Hello. Just keep me alive for some more time. Give me a little life more. Not for myself, but for those who believe in you. I have committed a lot of sins. This is the only chance to earn grace. One who is within me That person is saying Now it is time To repay your debt My eyes are watery, breath hurts Wound has become fresh again In the loneliness of my heart And in all my stories You have always been there Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Lower the gun. Get away! Get away! Well done. After all, you reached here. For this girl. So, what are your plans? Malik Sir, let Reema go. Otherwise? Will you kill me? Kill me? I could not understand one thing, Shivam. Why did I trust you more than animals? Tolerated you for this girl? Killed my brother, killed Munna, for this girl! But you didn't answer my question. Why? Why did you not kill this girl? There is a voice, which keeps reverberating in my ears. There is a face which appears in front of my eyes again and again. She was my peace. She told me to set the birds free and God will shower His Grace. Set the disciples of God free. She said setting one helpless soul free is setting humanity free. Today I have got a chance, to follow her advice, and that is what I am doing. Malik Sir, those whose own dreams remain unfulfilled, they fulfill the dreams of others. But you won't understand this. Not you. You are doing this because, you want to perform some good deed before dying. You think, that your God, will shower Grace on you. God will grant you a place in heaven! Bullshit! Malik Sir, I don't need a place in heaven. I've just come to save this girl from this hell. I have opted death for myself, and for you. Shivam. Come on, Shivam. Go, Bilal is waiting for you at the docks. I'll take care of them, you, go. -Kabir, come with me! -You go now. Let's go. Shivam! Shivam! Shivam! Shivam, come! Shivam! Come! Let's go from here! When I start firing, both of you run towards the boat. Shivam. Please, come. This burden of aimless life, is too much for me. Stopping here is my destination. Wait. Take this. Thanks for freeing me. Thank you. Go. -Go, go. -Won't go without you. Take her away! Take her! No! No! Go. Go. Go. No. No. No. Go! No! No! Shivam! -Come on! -Shivam! Now From this place I have to Go away In these paths Is my friend On those paths I have to tread Come on Torment me Come on Make me cry Come on Come on Come on In this manner, that vagabond, by giving his life freed me from that prison. I have come here today so that we can free those, who have been enslaved against their wishes. Whose wails, shouts are not heard. Freedom is not given to anyone. Freedom is our right. Why didn't I believe you? Why did I keep away from you? Life kept committing atrocities on me Only you gave me shelter Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old What is this suffering? What is this punishment? Why did I Remember you today? My days are restless Nights are restless Tell me what to do My own feet are shackles for me Please free me from myself Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old The one who is inside me Is asking me to Now it is time To repay your debt My eyes are wet, breath is giving pain Wound is fresh again In the loneliness of my heart And in all my stories You have always been there Our Relationship is very old Our Relationship is very old
