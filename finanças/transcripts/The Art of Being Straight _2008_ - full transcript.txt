You um, you go out a lot in Boston? - Sure, yeah. - Like uh, like clubs? - Uh, bars mostly. - Like, like regular bars? - Regular bars. - When can you start? (smooth acoustic guitar) (laughing and chatting) - I would've remembered that because that was the same night as run-a-block, walk-a-block. - What's that? - That's Andy's theory that when you're drunk you don't know what's going on, so you can literally run a block and then walk a block and it gets you home faster. - I'm gonna go ahead and say you're a donkey douche. - What are you guys talking about? - Uh, Matt here seems to think that this kid that works at the pool hall is a homo. - Brian, if you like guys that means you're gay. - [Brian] Matt, he didn't say anything like that. - Then what'd he say? - He didn't say anything, ya dumpy bastard.

Uh, I like Capa. - Robert Capa? - Yeah. - Yeah, he's great. I went to a uh, to an exhibit of his a few months ago at the Getty. - Really? I've uh, I've never been. - Now I have to take you. Are you okay? - I was just uh, just wondering where the, the food is, it's almost two so I should probably um... - So? - So? - Do you like girls? - (laughs) Yeah, yes. - Some were wondering in the office. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. - No, no it, it doesn't. - So are you straight? - Yeah. (nervous laugh) What? - I'd really like to see your photographs. I might be seeing that friend of mine in the next few weeks. - All right. - Good. Ah, food. - (nervous laugh) Thank you. (clears throat) (knocking) - [Man] The landlord.

Hey, so what's with the bike? - What do you mean? - I don't know, I always see you with it. It's kinda like a hipster requirement, isn't it? - It's a, it's a bike. - And you're a hipster. - (laughs) I'm not a hipster. - Oh no? - No, and I'm not the one smoking pot on my couch and reading Sartre. - Neither am I. I'm smoking pot and reading Sartre. - (laughs) Sartre, Sartre? Am I pronouncing it wrong? - I think so, yeah. - I've always heard uh. - I've always heard Sartre. - Mm hm. - Mm. You know, you're not like a lot of the um, other girls that I've met out here so far. You seem like have um, a better sense of who you are than a lot of the people I run into. It's uh, you seem uh, content, that's what I mean. - Okay yeah, well I'm not. - Why not? - Because I hate my job, and the people that I work with are a cult of bloodsucking vampires. - Ew, what do you do? - I work at an art gallery. - Mm. - Hey can I ask you a personal question? - Yeah. - How come you're wearing eyeliner? - Eyeliner, I'm not wearing eyeliner. - Are you gay? - Am I gay? - Well, you seem a little gay. Well, I can see your nipples through your shirt. There's the eyeliner thing and the sort of, just, I don't know. - No, I'm not gay. - Okay. - Are you gay? - I have a girlfriend. - Really, what's her name? - Her-- (door knob rattling) Shit. - Hi. - How'd you get in here? - You gave me a key, remember? - Look, I didn't ask you for, I only want one. Yeah, just one. Yeah, is that the price listed? (phone ringing) Uh huh. And that includes delivery? Yeah, you can reach me here. Nope, thank you. Ah. So, when am I gonna get to see your photographs? - Uh, soon, very soon. - Mm, good. I'm seeing that friend of mine soon. How about this weekend? - I, I have plans. - Right, you have plans. (phone ringing) (cellphone ringing) - This is Jon. - [Paul] Hey, this is Paul. - Paul, hi, how are you, how are you doing? - [Paul] Good, just picked up some wine, relaxing. What are you up to? - Uh, what am I up to, I'm out with, I'm out with some friends. - [Paul] Why don't you stop by on your way home? - (clears throat) Stop uh, stop by? - [Paul] Yeah, I mean uh, you can show me your photographs, have a glass. Come on, bring 'em over. - Bring 'em over? - [Paul] I'll be up, packing. I leave for Vancouver tomorrow, so this might be the only chance I'll have to look at them for a while. - Um. - [Paul] Yeah? - Yeah it's uh, it's Jon. - [Paul] Hold on, I'll buzz you in. (buzzer) - God. - [Paul] Uh, yeah? - Yeah it's, it's Jon, I missed the buzzer-- (buzzer) - Make yourself comfortable. - This is a really nice place. - It's okay. - And did you fall asleep in the middle of this? - That was um, that was an accident actually. Um, you know, she was swinging and I was taking that picture and then, I didn't get the exposure that I wanted, but-- - Have you shown these anywhere? - Like a, like a gallery? - Yes, like a gallery. - Uh, no I mean it's always just sort of been a, like a hobby, so. Is that, is that Hawaii? - Oh no, Puerto Rico. - Who's that, who's that in the, in the picture? - Oh that's, that's Kevin. Just a good friend of mine. - I went to uh, to Puerto Rico with my family once. - Have brothers, sisters? - Hm mm, hm mm. - Have you told them? - Told them what? - You're gay. (laughing) - I'm not gay. - Kidding. - I know, I knew, you were kidding. - You know, I'm trying to think of who else I know in the art world with a gallery that deals with photography. I mean uh, at least someone that'll take a look at your work. No, most of my friends they just show paintings, fine art, stuff like that. - Um, you don't have to think of, I mean it's fine. - No, no, no, it's obvious, you've got talent. - Thank you, appreciate that. - I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you. (laughs) - I just find it hard to believe you never kissed a guy or anything. - Why? - Well, you just seem like someone, someone who'd be willing to try anything once. - I was, there was once, there was, I was drunk once in high school. - Really? - Really. I mean we, we didn't sleep together or anything like that. We just fooled around and stuff. We were, we were drunk. - And you're not gay. - I'm not gay. - But, you fool around with boys? - Uh, um, boy, single, one. - I notice you do that. - Do what? - That, when you're nervous. - What this, no. (laughs) I'm not nervous, it's fine. Man! Quite the collection you've got here. I love this, I love this movie, this is really, - This one? - One of my fave-- - Yeah. I remember that, that, do you remember that scene? - Which one? - With the um, when they go to the pool hall-- - Yeah? - and they bet them the, a hundred bucks uh, that they're gonna um-- I can't do this. - Sorry. - I really can't do this. - You just looked so beautiful right there I had to kiss you. - I just, I just don't wanna, I don't want, I don't wanna, I don't, I don't wanna jeopardize anything, so. - I won't tell anyone. About this, about what just happened. Why would I, Jon? I mean, I have just as much to lose, if not more. - I just, I just don't, I don't think this is a, this isn't a good idea, so. - I'm sorry, I'm, I, I'm sorry if I offended you. - No, it's uh, I, I could have stopped you, so. - Then why didn't you? Do you wanna move to the bed? - Hey honey. What's up? - Nothin'. - What do you mean nothin', I can tell. - What? - That little dimple thing, right there, in the, the side of your mouth when you're lying. - No I don't, what? - Oh my God, I can totally see it. You're totally lying about something. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Jon, do not listen to your friend, he is a crazy person. But seriously, did you, somebody? - (laughing) I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh! - Uh. - Mm. - Which one's the male and the female? - I don't know. - Oh. - That one. - That's the male. - Yeah. (running shower) - Stay. I wanna fuck you again in the morning. (laughing) - I have to, I have to go. My roommate's, he's gonna be wondering. - Okay. This was really your first time? Don't tell me you're regretting it already. - [Jon] I have to go. - You're adorable. - Look Anna, I'm not sure about tonight, okay, I'm sorry. Baby, can we talk about this later? I gotta go. - No cellphone in the gallery, I've told you that before. - I know I'm sorry, I just had to make a quick call and there was nobody here, so I thought-- - Here, fax that. - Okay. - Fax that. - Okay. - He's right, you know, you're not supposed to be on your cellphone. - Thank you, I know that. - Yeah Mom, everything's great, yeah. No, I haven't talked to Dad, no, no I will, yeah. Okay, I love you too. Okay, bye. - Cowboy. - What's up? - I met a girl today. I was at the supermarket buying mangoes and there was this chick like right there buying mangoes. So we're standing in the supermarket center checkout line and I do this little half-turn and I say, screw it, and I look directly at her and I say, "Hey." I mean anyways, I wish I could just pick up a bottle of wine, brought her back to my place. I mean it's more about the fantasy and not the actual reality of it, but I just still, miss the old days, man, when we used to go out. - I did something last night, Andy. - I knew it. What'd you do? - I can't tell you, man. But I definitely did something big. - Dude, you can't say you something big and not tell me about it. She's really getting to you, huh? The girl back home that you're on a break with? You slept with that chick from the pool hall. And, and what, are you feeling guilty about it? You weren't in love. You left her, remember? - Yeah, you're probably right. - You know, Bela and I were talking about you the other night, and I was telling her that out of anyone I know I think you're gonna make it. Because you always know exactly what you want and who you are. - Thanks Andy, appreciate that. - Don't worry, man, you're on the right path. And trust me, sex is the best medicine. - Hi. So uh. - [Jon] What? - [Simone] Admit it. - [Jon] Admit what? - [Simone] You're a player. - [Jon] (laughing) No I'm not. - [Donna] Uh, yeah you are, I can spot you boys a mile away. You better be careful with me, I've had my heart broken a lot lately. - [Jon] Can I ask you a personal question? - [Simone] Okay. - Do you like magic? - Um, yeah. - All right good, I'm gonna show you a card trick. - Okay. If it's 52-card-pickup, I will smack you. - All right. It's not 52-card-pickup but it's close. No, I'm just kidding. All right, ready? Pick a card. - I want-- - Just not that one, please. - I want that one. - Okay fine, you can have that one. All right, you got your card? - Yes. - Okay, great, don't show it to me. - I'm not. - I almost saw it. Put it back in. There you go, all right. Now shuffle, can you shuffle? - Of course. - All right, let's see it. - Okay. (cards shuffling) - Oh, wonderful, you're done shuffling. All right, ready? All right. - Okay. - Top Card. - The top one? - Top one. - Okay. - Is that your card? - (laughing) Wait, how did you do that? - It's magic. - Okay then, do it again. - It's a one-time show. - Wow, you really are a player. - I'm not a player, I'm just, I'm just a lowly magician. - You're not gonna call. - You're thinking of somebody else. - I bet you say that to all your girls. - Oh yeah? - I don't often do this. - Ha ha ha! Yeah, I bet that's what you say to all your guys. Wanna move to the bed? - Yeah. - Where's the bed? - (laughing) That way. - Oh! - Uh! You're so hot. - You are. - Scorpio. (heavy breathing) - [Simone] Pleasure looks good on you. (crickets chirping) (distant heavy bass) - Um, Bob Marley? - Basquiat. Come on, it's my feeble attempt at a hip art reference. - I know I, I see it. - What are you supposed to be? - I'm a history teacher. - Good costume. - Happy Halloween. - Yeah. - Um, where you coming from? - Eh, we went to this Halloween party, sort of. It was really just a bunch of lesbians with fake mustaches. - We? - Uh, me and Anna. - Uh, care to join me? No fake mustaches, I promise. - Is that whiskey? - [Guy] Andy! - Andy! - Andy! - Freakin' A on your freakin' chest, man! - I know man, it's A for Andy! - Hey, know what it reminds me of? The Scarlet Letter. (laughing) Dude, it is the Scarlet Letter. - Oh! - Oh, oh shit! What? - [Cole] Andy! - What's up, man? - Yeah, boy! - Jon, you are way too sober right now, you know that? - You gotta take it off! - We are sports fans, and the R and the O are meeting us at the party. - [Jon] I see that, I definitely see that. - Go Rays, Rays! - Rays, rays! - Guys, shut the fuck up. - I gotta be up early man. - Oh my God, I have to get up so early, I really do. (laughing) - Well, what am I gonna be? - Go Rays! - What's goin' on, man! - Dineenie the weenie! My mom wants her dildo back. - Hey man, everything you say tonight's gonna be settled tonight, it's amazing. - That's funny, that's real funny. - And if you start waxing drunk about that chick, I swear. - Don't worry about me, pal, I got laid again last night. - [Andy] That's my boy, dude! - Take back what I said. - [Aaron] What's that? - I don't like your place. - Well, thanks Basquiat, I appreciate that. - I just mean you need some art on the walls or something. - Well, perhaps you could do some of your graffiti there. (glasses clink) You've got a... - What, what? - A dreadlock. - Oh. (laughs) - Um, Velvet or Coltrane? - Is that a record player? - What? - Oh, nothin'. Hipster. No, quiet's fine. Thanks for the drink. - How's Anna? - She's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. She wants to get serious. - What's that mean? - She thinks that we should live together. Yeah. - And you don't? - I, I don't know, man. - I was engaged. - You were not. - Yeah, um, about six months ago. Trust me, we had all the art on the walls you could imagine. She uh, helped run this gallery in Connecticut. Something went wrong, she was just the first to do something about it. - And so she left you. - Wasn't meant to be. - You really believe in all that stuff? - Sure, why not? - I gotta go. - You need Coltrane? - I don't need Coltrane, I need sleep. - Maddy. You don't look anything like Basquiat, by the way. (electronic music) - I'm holding it straight! Listen to me, seriously, okay, so it's-- - Make sure I'm in it. - Okay, okay. - Class of 2008, remember this for the rest of our lives, seriously. - Yeah yeah, no no. - Are you ready, are you serious? - Get in, seriously. Here we go. - Smile. - There it is. ♫ Gotta know what type of person you're dealing with ♫ Gotta know if he's a hippie or he's a punk - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Where are you going? - I'm going home, I told you I'm tired. - I was just talking. - And I'm just tired, Andy. - Bela. - Andy. - Go Rays, asshole, go Rays. - What happened to you? - What do you mean? - Why, why do you have, why are you a pirate right now? - Already happened. - Yeah, what, what are you guys?

Someone's been doing it, and you're always by the machine. - Rand, I-- - Look, I'm not necessarily accusing you, I'm just saying that the machine will break down with all that weight on it. - I really have no idea what you-- - (laughing) I was gonna say, man, I was like-- - No, but, but seriously. I took a call from the New York office this morning, and apparently they didn't get the package I asked you to send. - But I, I confirmed this morning that the package was, I confirmed this morning that it was confirmed uh, I, excuse me, I confirmed that it was delivered at 9 AM this morning. - Yeah, they received it, but it's not the package that I asked you to send. Okay, half the presentation materials were missing, not to mention the cover letter. (light knocking) Yeah? - Uh, Rand? Um, line one. - Okay. (deep sigh) Look, I get it, mistakes happen, okay? I see my barbed wire tattoo in the mirror every morning. People are talking, okay? You're fallin' off, buddy. I'm just sayin', stay on target. Be that confident, big blue-eyed Jon that I hired, all right? All right? - Okay. - All right, thanks. This is Rand. Yeah.

I'd just like to take you out. - I don't think so. - Why? - Because, because I don't, I don't think so, I don't know. - No, we can have dinner, talk, just have a nice conversation. - I can't go on a date with you. - Why not? - Because, because there's a lotta reasons why not. - Tell me one. - You're twice my age. - What does age have anything to do with it? - If I was gonna, if I was gonna go on a date with someone like you, I-- - What do you mean someone like me? What are you afraid of? - (laughing) Okay, I have to go. - Of course you do. You don't wanna raise any suspicions. You don't wanna any of your friends wondering what you might be doing, finding out their friend is a fag. - Fuck you, Paul. (crickets chirping) (passing cars) (sharp breath) (sensual moan) (sharp breath) (sensual moan) (dry heaving) (male voice and footsteps) (toilet flushing) (heavy breathing) It's good to see you. - Yeah, I'm glad you called. Do you remember that time, like the first week freshman year we got busted gettin' high in your dorm room? - Yeah. - Yeah, remember that little bitch RA, that little like mini troll, fuckin', I don't know her name, what? - Vanessa, I think. - Vanessa, was it? She had a big crush on you. - Have a crush on me? - Knockin' on the door, "I smell something funny in here." So, I'm gonna quit my job this week. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know, join the circus? - How's Anna? - I'm over it. - Over what? - Whole relationship thing, you know? You wanna spark it? - No, I'm good, thanks. - Man up, dude, there's no cops around here. - I slept with a guy. - You did what? - My boss. - When? - Last week. - So, were you? - Was I what? - Were you givin' or takin'? - Don't ask that. - Come on, it's legit. - No it's not. - Eh, come on, eh.

I can picture it! - Stop! - Well, did you like it? - I don't know. - You don't know? - A little. I liked the attention I guess. - So you think you're gay? - I like girls, I slept with a girl last week. - What girl? - Some girl. - Ugh, so typical. - What? - You go out and you sleep with this girl so you can get this guy outta your head. - No I didn't. - Yes you did. - No I didn't. - Yes you did! Why is it so hard for you to admit that like, you might be gay? - Because I'm not gay. 'Cause I don't even have the, I don't have the urge to fall in love with a man, or. I don't even have the urge to kiss a man. - But you just wanna fuck him? Look okay, I say you go around for like a week and tell people that you're gay, and just see what happens. - That's ridiculous. - Why not? Are you gonna do it again? You totally loved it. Oh my God. - Maybe I am gay. - Please don't say that like it's a disease. - I just, there's days when I know that I'm straight, I know it. And then, and then there's days when... - Maybe what you can get from a woman, like emotionally, you just can't get from a guy. - You're fuckin' stoned. - Yeah well, I am stoned 'cause I'm smoking this joint by myself.

What I'm trying to say is that the client asked for something, and we gave him what he wanted, we delivered. - Paul, the ad looks like shit. It sends the wrong message to buyers, we're gonna end up losing both clients. - Jon, come here for a second. - [David] You're gonna ask him? - If he likes it. - You're banking a half million dollar deal for a gay-targeted ad on a fucking straight kid? - Jon, does this make you wanna buy jeans? - Um, no not really. - [David] Thank you. - You're right, what was I thinking asking him?

I'd be like, really okay, like that turns you on, okay. Like, I'll, I'll, I've never done that. - You have dated a lot of gay guys? So that a guy being gay wouldn't, wouldn't stop you? - There was come a point, I'd be like, "Are you gay?" And they'd say, "No." Take their word.
