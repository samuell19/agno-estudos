You live around here? Could you put me up tonight? I've got nowhere to go. Hey. WET WOMAN IN THE WIND Hey mister. Mister! I didn't mean for free! Don't look down on me. Come on, dude. Well? What would you pay? Pay? Me? No, shithead. I don't pay, you do. How's 5,000 yen? It's cheap for the works. Right, dude? Haven't done it for a while, have you? I can tell by a guy's skin. Hey, wait... Ow... Hey mister! You'll regret brushing me off! I hate being ignored the most! Under the spreading chestnut tree. There we sat, both you and me. Oh how happy we would be. Under the spreading chestnut tree. "Silver knew Bob was telling the truth. A dull sound..." One day by the A-B-sea, a crab grabbed on to my pee-pee. Ow, ow, let me go! This sausage is mine now! Merbromin didn't do a thing Pyoktanin made it hairy. Oh, I get you. This is cool. I like this. Living alone in the forest. Just go away. You can't stay here, and I won't pay you. No. I've given up women. Sure you have. Then what's this stiff thing? Bodies don't lie, mister! Why are you still here?! You piss me off. You look down on me! That's why? You're like a stray dog. What? Do I disgust you that much? A bitch like me should starve and die? I don't get a second chance? There are snakes and wild dogs here. Find shelter before nightfall. You know, I've locked onto you. Don't think you can escape me. You can't. Thanks. Was it enough? Until last night. It lasted three weeks for lighting. Sounds about right. Thanks. It's slippery. What'll you do when it gem cold? Won't you want a power line for heating? No, my sleeping bag will be enough. Anyway, Yuzawa, could we go to Kubouchi's for coffee beans? Yeah, sure. No problem. Looks like Kubouchis wife isn't coming back. His daughter changed schools too. No kidding. Kosuke, wasn't he your university senior? I found out he was, but I didn't know him back then. Is that right? I thought you knew him well. No, not at all. His wife was my junior too. She was? You had the same major? Yeah, English literature. I didn't know her then though. You didn't? Oh, hello. Hi. Hey, Kosuke. It's been a while. Hi. No way! Fancy meeting you here. I'm so sorry for the other day. Forget it. What, you two know each other? How? -Well... -How can I explain about us? We crossed paths the other day. I see. Can we sit there? Yeah, sure. What'll you have? Blended coffee? Ah, yeah. And Kubouchi, 200 grams of my usual beans. She's cute, that girl. She's not your type. Well, yeah... My ideal woman's one in a hundred million. The kind you meet once in a lifetime. Kosuke, I wrote another new piece. Would you listen to it? Sure. Okay, if you don't mind. “You are for me. I know without seeing you. “You are beside me. Growing closer and closer. “In order to meet me. "To meet only one man, the man of your destiny..." “You approach me silently from behind, "and smile at me." "This is no accident. “Fate has brought us together." Hey boss. If making delectable coffee is an art, is having delectable sex an art too? Is it, boss? Don't! Don't! Tell me, what is Kosuke to you?! Tell me, Shiori! No, don't! Aren't these your wife's clothes? Damn you! No, don't! Don't! They're your wife's clothes! No, don't! They're your wife's... Don't! Don't, they're your wife's... "Honesty box". You're a surfer? Ah, yeah. Nice hut. Thanks. It's so weird. This is rain water, right? Can you filter piss too? Want to try? Sorry! So, who are you? Oh, right. I'm... Never mind your name. We won't see each other again. Oh, okay. Still... Right? Anyway, I'm a surfer. Surfing's cool. It's totally badass. Wanna try it sometime? Hey. You want me now, don't you? But you can't have me. If you do, you'll lose. Yeah? Don't tell me you were sleeping. Give me a break. Wait! Don't hang up. Listen. That guy from before wants to say thanks. Go on. I... I... What the hell? I told you not to. He's got a small one. But he's strong. 'Mat hurts, shithead! Don't hit me! Silly... new. If you tell me you want me. I'll go to you. I'll go to you now. Well? What do you say? Answer me... Hello. Nice weather today. Don't get me wrong. Actually, I've come to get that smartphone back. I really need it. I mean, it belongs to a customer. They've been asking. You threw it away? I really need it. I seriously need it. Hey Kosuke, get it for me, please? Get it yourself. But there are snakes and wild dogs, right? Hey. What's your problem? Why are you here? What for? I'm a... love hunter. So Kosuke, you did theater in Tokyo? But now you live like this. How come? Want to know? Not really. I'll tell you anyway. If a person wants to think deeply, they've got to be alone. Solitude helps, so I want to be alone, but I'm not right now! Got it? What's that? What? There it is! The lord of the forest. It's not a wild dog. It's from a greater realm. Hey. I've always thought I could be a good actress. You think so too? I mean, it'd be so cool. Being on stage in the spotlight looks like fun. Stand here. Look there, turn around, and say "No way." Here? Turn around? No way. As in what? As in what? What feeling did it express? It can have many meanings. No way. That was surprise and recognition. It can mean more. What about anger? No way! Suspicion. No way... Mischief. No way! Disappointment. No way. Now let's do “really.“ Surprise. Really? Anger. Really! Recognition. Really?! Suspicion. Really...? Confrontation. Really. Hold that end. No words this time. Anger. Surprise. Recognition. Suspicion. Triumph. Kubouchi? Dammit! Where is she?! Kubouchi? Where's the girl? What girl? Your waitress? Did you fuck her? No I didn't! Are you crazy?! If you touch her, there's no telling what I'll do. Kubouchi? Remember Tamaki. Remember your wife, and child. Please. You've got some nerve. Am I a joke? Am I a joke to you?! No. No... Get this, asshole. You fucked up my marriage! My naive small town wife fell for a wannabe intellectual recluse! Where did you fuck? Your hut? Out in the open?! You're wrong, Kubouchi. She told me straight. She wanted your body! Listen up. Just try taking my woman again. I'll kill you! He kissed you out of anger, right? Let me go! You can't have me yet. Her name's Shiori, right? Kubouchi's waitress. I hear she's been hanging with surfers around here. You know, at Kitahama. One of them came to Kubouchi's cafe. They just swore at each other at first, but then Kubouchi got physical. He might have been a tough guy once, but he's just a middle-aged washout now. It was a hell of a brawl. What about his wife? She won't answer his calls. Even the hospital couldn't get hold of her. I hear you got into quite a brawl. Kind of. You've got to laugh, right? Yeah. Oh, this. I couldn't believe it. I took off my ring for a second, and that girl swallowed it. I couldn't make her cough it up. Now it's in her guts, soaking in piss and shit. Or just shit. Hey, you okay? Sorry. I feel a bit sick. You haven't been eating well. Living out there like that is too hard on you. You know where the cafe Key's hidden. There's food in the kitchen. Eat it. Use the room upstairs. Why are you being so kind to me? By way of apology? Well, there's that, but if Tamaki calls I want you to give her a message. I want to start over. Tell her I want to do that. For the record, there really was nothing between us. I know. Let's put that behind us. I'm over it now. Okay? Well, okay. Yuzawa? When Kubouchi gets out, could you give him this? Tell him it's from Shiori. Be sure not to mention my name. No excuses, but it wasn't my fault. Got it. I'll make sure I don't mention you at all. I'll bury it inside me... Hey. Okay, I'm counting on you. Long time no see. "What? 'Trouble in Mind" again? Come on, I came all the way from Tokyo to see you. My feminine intuition's razor-sharp. Girl problems? Don't smoke in here! You suddenly said you wanted to be alone. I was worried you might have killed yourself somewhere. I came here to get away from women! So please, leave me alone! No way, Kosuke baby! Go or I'll rape you. Go ahead. Check it out. Fresh, right? New theater troupe members. -I'm Aoki. -I'm Midorikawa. -I'm Kurita. -I'm Kuwano. She's my assistant. An ardent fan of playwright Kosuke Kashiwagi. I'm Yuko Sanjo. We were on our way to perform in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Akita, until last night's earthquake. Earthquake? Didn't you feel it? So let us stay today and tomorrow. Stay? Where will you all sleep? Don't worry. We've got a tent, and we're used to it. We can make our own food too. So, this is the head? Indeed. What of the torso? Look, as I said, it does not exist in this world. What? There is a head, but no torso? There is undeniably a woman's severed head here, but you say her body does not exist? Indeed. -Indeed? -Indeed. Chief Judge, as I said before... Who might you be? An innkeeper. Speak. It all began on my inn's street in our post town, when lo and behold, from a knothole in a wall, a woman's head began startling passersby. She was quite beautiful, but did not reveal herself. She merely laughed out loud, and upon trying to touch her, she vanished into the hole. My guests were terrified. The townspeople agreed to employ this famous swordsman, and when he swung his blade down on her neck, her translucent head fell in a spray of blood, and rolled on the ground, but there was nothing beyond the knothole. Beyond, you w? By beyond, I mean my inn's, er... Its courtyard. The woman was in there? No sir, as I said, there was no one beyond the wall, but a beautiful woman's head protruded from a knothole... This head? Indeed. And you severed it? Indeed. Therefore, you are the perpetrator of this murder! Chief Judge. As I said, this Vagabond swordsman is not a murderer of women... Enough, enough, enough! Your movements are uniform, but your emotions shouldn't be! What would that convey to your audience? Could it convey what you've seen and heard to your audience? Probably not. Alright, switch roles again. You switch with him. You two switch too. Got it? Understand others' roles to understand your own. Do it again. Ready... Go! So, this is the head? Indeed. What of the torso? Isn't this my script? It is. How are my boys doing? Er, well... I'm not sure "doing" is the right word. You're right. It all began on my inn's street... Enough! Are you kidding me? That was awful. There's no soul in it. Are you happy with that, as actors? No. It's bad, isn't it? Oh crap. Are you kidding me? Who's she? A local stray dog on the loose. That's your 'Trouble in Mind"? Don't. Leave her alone! Seems you've been watching our rehearsals. How were they? Tell me what you think. What, can't she talk? I get it. Kosuke called you a stray dog, so you're pretending to be one. I like it. You're a dog then. A dog named Oscar. You're on a desert island with your owner. You're a dog, so you can't talk, but you want to tell him something. Well? Want to try acting out that little etude? Improvised theater. No way. Not a shitty premise like that. How can actors follow such shitty direction? You shitty ideas are killing their performances, don't you think? You're right. I'll think of another premise then. Give me a second. No, I'll do it. The one you came up with. But I'll add something. This bitch with a message for her owner has used magic to become human, but each step I take is agony. The spell is about to wear off. When it wears off, I'll become a dog again. I'll never be able to see my owner again. What's wrong? Oscar? Oscar? What is it? Oscar? What's wrong, Oscar? Oscar? Oscar? Okay! What the hell is she? What's really going on between you and that girl? Explain it to me properly. She's just a... Come on, don't give me that dog and bicycle crap! I know you can't live without women! Celibacy? What a joke. You're a chronic womanizer. Back in Tokyo, all the furious men you've stolen women from are eagerly awaiting your return. What'll you do? I've never done that! I'm sick of listening to your excuses! Kiss me. -What the hell? -Please! Ow ow ow'. Come on... Kosuke! I'll just touch you. I'll just get naked. I'll just ride you. Ow! Where's everybody? They left. For Fukushima. Then why are you still here? I want to be of service to you. Ms. Kyoko agreed to it. I wasn't your first, was I? No. There was somebody else? What kind of guy was he? My high school P.E. teacher. One summer after class, he forced himself on me. Oh. That's a painful memory. But the power's in your hands. To overcome your past and walk on. To go wherever you like. But sir... You don't need to say goodbye. It's time to go. Someone's waiting for you at the end of your journey. Go. But... But... Sir! Go. Yeah, bring it! Dammit, dammit, dammit! I can't take any more of this! You feel the same too, don't you? Don't you? Then you get naked too! "You are beside me." “Growing closer and closer. "In order to meet me." It thrills me... It touches me... It electrifies me... It makes me want to cry! I can't help myself! I can't help myself! I can feel it washing over me! “Your one-in-a-hundred-million fingers, “your slender white fingers... "gently embrace me..." “So I... Yeah? Oh, Mrs. Kubouchi. It's Kashiwagi. Yes. No, he's not out yet. No. Er, he asked me to give you... a message. Yes. Er, "I still want to" “bend you over...“ Wait, he said “start over.“ Yes. "Start over.“ “Bend you over." No, wait... No, Mrs. Kubouchi, wait. Wait! Wait! Where to? With you? Anywhere. A tiger that escaped from a Yuzenji Temple facility yesterday has been recaptured by its keepers, but police are concerned, and are investigating how it escaped... ”Who's the dog?” Yuki Mamiya.
