I came to… I want to forg… I… How can I forgive you? Cheating is one thing, but with our kid there? Are you coming? -Wannes? -Hey Eline! I know I promised to cook tonight, but is pesto pasta OK? Yeah. So, would you mind nipping to the shop for pesto and pasta? Yeah. Thanks, you're the best! Got to go, bye! He's got a date! So have we, right? How does this work again? Hang on. Your mum again, really? Are you sure? Eline! She's got the key. -Eline? -But… You OK? I've been calling for 30 minutes. I'm coming, Mum. I'll be right back, OK? If I don't reply, I'm fine. -But you didn't answer your phone. -I was busy. Is that what you were busy with? One-night stand from Wannes. Ha right, Wannes! Is that his name? And, er, one-night stand? More like a one-hour stand, you know? One-hour stand? Well, he's not wrong: men are no good after an hour! Alright, Mum. Alright, I'll be off. When do I get to see you? Err… call me. OK… if your phone's on! Alright, darling. Bye! Sorry. It's not your fault. So? Same scenario, version 3. Mum at the door. You know, you should ask for your key back. -She's my mum! -And? -She's the parent, not you. -She's lonely, Wannes. OK, let's change the subject. Let's practice a job interview. So, I'm Vera. And you're your normal, lovable self. You'd sit like that? Of course not, Ms Cambier! So, erm, your good friend and housemate, Wannes, believes you'd be an asset to Motion Care. Is that the case? Who am I to contradict him? No. You have to agree right away. No uncertainty. Even experienced people would be unsure. This is a job at Motion Care! You've done placements? How were the results? -Good. -No, great! Your three months in Bolivia for the medical charity? What do I say if Vera asks about that placement? I had to come home early to rescue Mum after Dad took off with some slut? That's a good thing, though. Shows you care about people. No bad thing for a physio. You're free to start straight away? One patient needs, erm, extra attention, erm… Joy Vande Winde. -Obviously you know Lars Vande Winde. -No. What? Oh my! A real killer, eh? Sadly enough in every sense of the word. Meaning? He's a killer. The papers had it all. I don't read them. Luckily for you, I do. It was last year. Picture this: 2007, she was… a star with a healthy income, and he was developing games with a mate in a garage. 2008: a wedding for the rich and famous. That same year, a kid, true love, who's to say… But then, in 2016: an accident. He ran her over, Eline. He ran over his wife, with his daughter in the car. His own daughter? Admitted with a fractured femur and two broken ribs. So, I've got one last question for you. Would you be OK to do the late shift every day? I'm single, no other obligations, so I can focus fully on the job. We need the patient's approval. Joy? Joy, this is Eline, and she may be Pieter's replacement. I'm thirsty. You love horses, too? When I was your age, I always rode Gipsy, a dark horse with a blonde mane. But I galloped before I could, and I fell. My back. I was in rehab a long time. I know what that's like. That's why I'm here. And then? Did you ever get back on a horse? The very first second I could! I'm glad you two clicked. I hope it lasts. I'm Lars Vande Winde, Joy's Dad. Joy's rehab's been over a year. The accident hurt her. Too much. I want a physio who can help without more pain, without having to relive the trauma. I know it's hard, but I won't stop until I find one. And? You're hired. I must warn you, you're the 13th hire in less than a year. Because they couldn't carry on? Because he fired them. Here you go. Signing a contract is making a promise. And a promise should be a thing of beauty. To impress your friends, you broke your NDA, and deceived us all. You created uncertainty. You made a promise into something ugly. It was one friend. It was to get feedback on the design. A promise is binary: you keep it or you break it. Your unemployment form, your choice. Your badge. Good evening. -You've smoked. -Not in the car. Nothing in, nothing out. Same with your toxic nature? I was different then. Problems? Problems. Why can't I trust people? Because they… don't trust anyone themselves? Or they don't trust themselves. How much longer, Lars? When will you let all this guilt go? I miss my brother. Who you pissed on while drugged up in the gutter. You did give me a second chance, but I grabbed it. I'm telling you he's hurting. I say he prefers hurting others. Forget about Lars and be glad you have a job! To your new challenge! Cheers! Thanks for cooking. As you can see, I've done my best. -I'll help you clear up. -No way. I insist. New date? No, it's right now. Why you still here? -Do you mean that? -Yeah. Ah, wow, you're the best! The best what? Housemate. Lars Vande Winde here. The boiler has a problem. Suddenly, the water was ice cold. You can't come, I'll be out. Yes, again. So if you could explain how I can fix it myself… For dummies, please. Just a moment. Nick, I'll be 15 minutes. I've got a plumbing problem. So… The filter. How has Joy been in rehab so long for an Ilizarov op? She's also got compartment syndrome. What am I missing? Joy. -What? What do you mean, "Joy"? -Just Joy. What do you think? Honest opinion. Do you mean that? Even at work? Can't I show I'm in demand? Let me tell you as a friend: At times you're so full of yourself that's all there's room for. -Where's our spot? -Dad wants us to work alone. Toes up! Yeah. Bend your other leg now. Ow! You're hurting me. -We're going to try and stand up. -I can't. We're just going to try. Alright. I'm just here, OK? You're even worse than all the others. Help me. You can do more than you think. I can do more than you think. Joy… Joy? Joy, wait! You've broken the record. Most physios recall the "no pain for the daughter" rule a bit longer. -How can she get better? -With lots of patience. Patience makes things weak, including muscles. She must cross her pain barrier. If he cares about his daughter… Oh, he cares, believe me! And I care about Motion Care. We won't exist without him. -I want to help her. Really. -You do? Then make sure I don't get her crocodile tears again! No, Daddy, no! No, Daddy! Daddy! -Daddy, no! -Joy. Joy! Hey, wake up! Joy! Hey. You're here, I'm with you. You had a nightmare. A horse so dark you don't want to ride it. I had that one too, but believe me, it stopped the day I got back on a horse. -I want that too. -I know. Tell me about that horse again. Then I fantasized that Gipsy and I rode through the night. -Hello, sir, I'm Eline. -I know. So? She had a nightmare. -May I? -Sir… She's just got back to sleep. Daddy was there. -Does he never come in the day? -He doesn't want to see me. -I think he does. -But not in my brace. I have an idea. How about, every time you do an exercise, I draw a line on your brace, like in show jumping? And when you get to the top, we take the brace off. Can I go back on my horse? Almost. There's a problem, though. For each line there's a little pain. And relax. One more. OK. Yes. Really good. Relax. There you go. Photo? HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HAPPY! DADDY Your four weeks must be nearly a record. She doesn't run to Vera? No, but she does threaten to. Vera's with you now. Not Lars though. He makes her pain his pain. You're too focused on Lars and Joy. Come on, let's go out. Mixed public, a chance for us both, same place, different pace? Don't say I only think of myself! I never have. "So full of yourself," you said. I've had better compliments. Wannes, I know you're there for me. That was about your fear of commitment. Hi Eline! So? How's the job? -Hi Wannes. -Hi. Madame Bovary is on TV tonight, a remedy for love. Not now, Mum. It's DIY night for fun tonight. I've got to work. -Oh. So what do I do? -Try a night on your own. -What's gotten into you? -Eline and I were just about to go out. No, Wannes. You come out with me then. As far as the front door. So, imagine that this is a real horse. Take it by the reins… The reins. Now try and touch my hand. -It hurts. -I know, but you're doing well. Again. Come on, you can do it! Come on, Joy! No-one gets to cause me pain! No-one! I'll tell my daddy. I'll tell him! Alright. That's a no, then. Excuse me, sir. I guess Joy told you everything. -I know you love Joy. -You don't. Of course not. And that's not what I meant. It's just that your guilt… Watch your words, Eline Durlon. No, no, someone has to say it. We all nod, bow, go easy on you, don't confront you. The truth is… Silence! I need no lecture on guilt. This truth you talk of does not exist. Hello? Ms Cambier. OK, I understand. It's just that your guilt… your guilt… your guilt… I need no lecture on guilt. Joy? This is An, she'll be Eline's… It's not my day. But at least we're together. Pre-alpha, to test. -Can't your team do that? -They'll just love it. DO A GOOD JOB! LOVE, ELINE X Here, Lars, I'm on level 30. Shit. Well, that's a problem. I hope the new one gets it. I've searched long enough. Players are only safe in the bunker. They're all aiming for it, so it needs more disguise. You need to focus on the obstacles. Our motto: behind every solution there's a problem. Check any advice from your workmates with me. For them it's still a game. Welcome. Vera? If anything comes up… You all know what to do? I'm on my way. Nostalgic? Is that what's bothering you? You got to the final level so fast. It's too easy. It's not that amazing in your bunker, Lars. -You got into the bunker? -Yep. Yet instead of fixing that, I have to do Vera's job. She can't find a replacement for Eline. Maybe I should move Joy from there. Or maybe you need to listen to Joy, Lars. For the real problem. And then reflect on what it's trying to tell you. She said it was me. But she cheated on me. She did. She wanted it a secret. She was running away from me. She caused Joy's… I'm sorry, Lars. Still. I, err… I've heard it's hard to find anyone. I want Eline. No-one else. Why has she gone? I didn't tell on her. -Tell on her? -That she caused me pain. I didn't tell anyone. Look. Hello, Ms Cambier? Hey, Eline! Err… Lars would like to hire you again. In fact he demands it. Eline? Yes, yes, I'm still here. I'm pleased, but I want to do my work properly. Of course. I mean, be allowed to do it properly. -Can you agree with Lars… -He's not one to do deals. Look, I'm about to do an interview at another rehab centre. What are your conditions for coming back? She's got conditions. Right… So do I. Everyone has, Lars. Always. But not everyone is powerful enough to say so. Or has the guts. -It's Joy who wants me back? -Yep. Can you leave us? No problem. You get why I fired you? I, err… I went too far. I apologise. I never meant to… not respect you in… It was for Joy. No-one can help her as long as you fire people on her say-so. Yes, the exercises do hurt. But that pain can help… will help. My only condition for coming back is that I have your trust. Eline! Tomorrow, we start on the bigger show-jumping obstacles. Do you think we'll manage? OK, but on one condition. And when I got to the riding school, Gipsy was waiting for me. You told me that one already. OK, what do you want to hear? PRINCESS RAGOM -Something about a princess? -And a horse. And a horse. OK… Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful princess and her very favourite thing was to ride her horse. Its name was Beauty. And the king of that far-away land was in love with her and wanted to marry her, but he had one condition. As he loved her so much, he forbade her from any more horse riding. Because he was so afraid that she might fall. And then the horse was sold, and the princess was terribly upset. So, how did it go today? Good. She's asleep. I'll be quiet. Mr Vande Winde? My mobile number. So you can call me. To check how Joy is doing. Thanks. So, that was her one condition. God knows how the story I'm telling her ends. Welcome to my world. What do you think? Honest opinion. Good-looking. Come on, tell me more. I gave Lars my phone number. But that's a form of intimacy for you straights. For Joy, you know? You used Joy to get close to Lars! As if he'd be interested in me! Repel to attract. -Says the expert. -Wait. I have something for you. -About your Lars. -He's not my Lars. From your waiting room? CELEBRITY KILLED BY HUSBAND? Wannes, if a headline ends in a question mark, they don't know anything. He didn't go out for a month, not even to see his daughter. Look: "Left his daughter to her fate." People do withdraw after a trauma. Trauma? Two months later he sold absolutely all An-Sofie owned. Look: "The accident was his jackpot." What trauma? He wasn't even at her funeral. He was too busy counting his winnings. -Stop acting like he's a monster. -He is a monster! Spend your time on someone else. Can we change the subject? Oh, fuck. Look at this. "Looking for a relationship." So then what? Then it's a no. "Full of desire." Here, tell me your honest opinion. Are you tired? Sorry. Nick? No. I don't need you any more tonight. Keep your phone on. And, err… don't do anything stupid. Alright. -You're here for Wannes? -Yes. -Hey, I'm here for Wannes. -No… I'm here for Wannes. Right, err… Wannes will be here in a moment. Did he say a threesome? Full of passion? -Yes. -I'm Nick. Wannes! -Oh, fuck! -Right. Just not with me. -Err… I'm getting wet here. -Come in. -Sorry, I can explain. -Keep your explanation. So rude. You could at least have had the decency to cancel me. It's true, you're right. Another time? No, you wish. Well done! -Mr Vande Winde! -Eline. She stood up. No crutches, no brace. She stood up. And I think she can walk on her own. She just needs an extra little nudge. You. What can I do? Just be there. Sorry. Thank you. -Can I ride a horse now? -What? Well, we said that if she walked on her own… Remember I told you I galloped before I knew how? -And you fell. -That's right. All in good time. Before we go riding we need some more exercises. But now that you can walk, you can go home. And that's really good news, isn't it? It's great, but until she's at school, I'm at home. Would a priest run a brothel? -You're no priest. -Nor is your firm a brothel. I'll give you a list of everything to check. -I need you. There's no-one else. -Was that a compliment? Some of the blame is yours, too. Lars… I don't have to act like a victim just as you're playing the prosecutor. -Been there, done that. -Nick. Please. Hey, princess. What's wrong? Can't you sleep in our new house? I miss Eline. But you won't miss me any more. Isn't that good? Time to sleep. -You need to rest. -Eline tells me a story. -I'll read you one. -Eline. -What? -Eline. Hang on. Ooh, hold on. -Unknown number. -Answer it. Hi, this is Eline. Mr Vande Winde. Yes, that's right. I'd like that. Well, I'm nearly home. See you soon, bye. Well, well, well. "I'd like that." Right, hurry up. She's waiting. -She's waiting? -Yes, she's waiting. And every night she'd look out at the horses, trotting in the distance. And then they got married. There was a procession of knights. The king saw the princess looking at the horses and that that was hurting her. So… he let all the knights out… Right… Thanks for trying, but it's been 30 minutes. I know. It's not working. No, but thank you. My pleasure. Bye. Bye. But, Eline… You heard Eline. But not here. And she sounds different on Skype. Can't she just come? Please, Daddy. Mr Vande Winde. Joy wants to see you at bedtime. In real life. So you'd have to come to her. To our house. I've put it in writing. My driver will take you to and from. You'll get 250 euros per 30-minute story session. Entry to the hall and Joy's room. "Everywhere else is off limits." Jeez, this guy is mad. Is he worried about his designer gear? I hope you're not taking it. Eline. For Joy. You're early. And my driver was coming. I have a car. There's something I'd like to discuss with you. Can I come in? I'll show you Joy's room. It's not signed. I have some conditions. Why doesn't that surprise me? I'll come for stories, but for free, with you there, so gradually you can take over. All those restrictions show mistrust, and honestly, that hurts. It's not a good basis for working together. So, do we have a deal, Mr Vande Winde? Lars. Lars. The king forbade her from seeing the horses. But at night, when the king was asleep, the princess crept out to see the horses, to stroke and brush them. -And one night she couldn't resist… -She's asleep. What happens next? In the story. How would you do it? The princess broke her word. She never gave her word. Agreements have to be on both sides. They need to talk it out. What if the king won't talk? We'll see what happens tomorrow. I'll agree not to pay you if you let my driver drive you. So you know I'm not early or late. Good morning! Here we are again. Great, err… today's instructions. View this fragment critically. Right now it's a game for oldies. We want an AAA for our target group. We need better quality. Your focus today: increase response and weapon speeds. The avatar needs work, too. See the weapons section on page 328 of the game design manual. OK, I have a question. Does anyone have any fun here? That sounds like a deafening no. It also explains the boring game. The reward is just you get to sit in a bunker? So, the question is: What do we do about it? Lars said we must focus on the obstacles. I don't see Lars. Lars can see us. Which of you nerds can fiddle camera pictures? Right, well, fiddle then! Yes, but what he says is right. That camera lens is always on. All that Lars can see is that you're all being good little workers. Sending his driver, you're not serious? If you've got it… Seems to me that's not all Lars is flaunting. A side-effect of that chagrin. -Speaking of chagrin. -Sorry, I couldn't resist any longer. You survived two days. Well done! I wasn't even with friends. Night one was tough, night two was better. -So on night three you're back. -To tell you about it! Good on you, Mum. -But you're going out. -I have to go and tuck Joy in. So you're putting make-up on? -Err, Wannes? -I'm going. I take it he has a nice house? I've only been in the hallway and Joy's room. Want to come to the front door with me? Oh, it's you! I'm not stalking you, Wannes. I'm here for Eline. -Are you bi? -No, I'm a driver. Eline! It's for you. -His brother? -Same genes, different character. And a different life, especially the past. -Such an accident must have an effect. -Yes, but life has an effect. Then it's for the person to do something with their life. I need to tell my mother that. Nice thought. -Thanks. -Thank Lars. Without him, I wouldn't be here. Yep… Ex-junkie. How did Wannes look when he saw it was you? Oh, it was gold! That was… Hey, sorry for that night, eh? I don't know… It was… Yeah, I get you. Why his fear of commitment? We all have our flaws. Wow, what a service! -Come on, it's cold. -No, I'll wait. No, no. I'm not coming in. No-one gets to go in there. You're the exception. Why's that? They're waiting. Your own brother… -Joy's in her room. -Your brother stays outside? You're not here to discuss family relations. They're not your concern. There he is, Nick. -I'll be a minute. -We go in together. In your terms: We have an oral deal, article x, paragraph whatever. We both do it until you can take over. Clear? -Keep it brief. Report? -Everything to your liking. Shall we? Wow, no crutches. She's doing well. We can phase out the day sessions soon. -When can she go back to school? -Eline, come on. Because she lost track of time that night, she was late back to the castle. The king was still awake, and was waiting for her at the gate. He gave the princess a choice. She either couldn't go outside again, or inside. You can stop now. It's just getting interesting. She's ready for hippotherapy. Horse riding. I've promised her. For Joy, as part of her treatment. So she can apply all her exercises. Can you guarantee no falls? No. So the answer's no. Guarantees are for TVs or computers. -Things of value don't have guarantees. -Come in. I just wanted to ask you to come to the riding. I understand that you're concerned, so why not just come with us? -I'm going to walk. -For an hour? Yep. I'm even going to make a detour. I need fresh air. Have you any idea how your brother lives? Does he want me to? Tickle attack! Get him! Get him! Look who I found. -How you doing? -All good. Eline? Let's go to the horses! I've sent today's instructions. Please be back within an hour. OK. So, it's still quite hard to get over the bridge, -but you can be helped by another player. -Cool. Want to try it? Yeah, sure. -OK. Well done! -Do you think? High five! -Thank you, Daddy. -My pleasure, princess! And well done! Want to come and brush Sunshine? Yes, please. Hold on. I have something to say… and I hope it's meaningful to you. I trust you. Eline? -I have to, err… -Yeah. We can continue this later. Yes. Nick. What were you doing? Didn't you see that, or what? I did, I did. Hey, Joy! They're brothers. They're going to argue sometimes. We're together… It's alright. It's not that bad. Lean against the rest, OK? -No way! -So you've been drinking again. -One little beer. -One too many! You know you can't drink if you're working for me. -Do the test. -No more. -Test your bile. It's so black. -How dare you?! With my daughter in the car? Fucking junkie! Lars, I had one drink. Who can I trust? Not my friend, my wife, even my brother? -Lars, come on! -My own brother! -Lars… -In your gutter! No! Never! Never! I've been there. And I'm done with all that. Hey, I've learnt my lessons, Lars. Unlike you. You, man, you live on accusations. You breathe mistrust. And why? So as not to see your wife's death, your kid's accident… And you? What did you do? Fuck you, man. -You OK? -Leave him. Can you move your arm? No, no, no. I can't. Eline, can you take us home? -I'll call a cab. -You can't, you stink. -Thanks! -You can shower here. No, thanks. Joy needs you. I'll change and come back. I can't face the next few hours alone. Please. You have a dislocated shoulder. That sounds how it feels. But you're in luck, your joints are fine. It should actually be fixed quickly. -Is that OK? -Yeah, OK. It's OK. I think the best thing to do is just… Eline! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean… The water went cold! Yeah, I know. What? You know? You OK? Yeah, it was more the shock than the pain. OK, but the pain's gone now? Yes, and the screaming too. Does it need to be bandaged? No, not automatically. Don't overload it and you can do anything you want. Anything? Yep, anything. -Be careful with that shoulder. -Yeah, sorry. So not even workmen get to come in here? Not if I can fix it myself, no. Lars… What happened? The filter is probably blocked… Not to the shower, to you. What was that fight about? What they wrote about you… and An-Sofie, is that related… Has Nick… I… I… None of my business, OK. Can I have my clothes, to go home? -And Joy? -Joy? We had a deal. One day you were going to do the story. Well, that day is here. Right, dryer. Eline… wait. Do you think this can go somewhere? I know it can go somewhere. Not scared? I was 17 and head over heels in love. I'd have followed that guy anywhere. I thought it was forever. That pain, man… That pain. I thought about putting an end to that pain, putting an end to… it all. I swore I'd never commit to anyone again. Look… you're thinking of commitment as shackles. I… I think of an alliance. So, could we review that alliance from day to day? There's no other way. Wannes? Wannes? Mum? That's what they said in the papers. He's dangerous. -He really is capable of killing someone. -Wonderful! Nick… Open, sweet, smart, beautiful, and wholly unnecessarily in treatment by me for at least another week. Oh… What's happened? She called me herself. Of course, Mum. I'll always call you when I need you. And I'll always be there. What? Lars. But… Nick was the one hurt. But they did have a fight. And Nick blamed his brother for the accident… No, Mum! That's you saying that. Clearly something really bad happened. Something that he's bottled up and has been brewing inside him. Sounds like a guilty feeling. Yes, and Nick clearly has something to do with it. -My Nick? -Your Nick? Since when? What about Nick? Lars said that he did something. Sorry, but you're being very vague. Apparently Nick was… Yes, I know all about Nick's past. He's told me all about it. And Lars, what has he told you? -Lars? -Can you do stories tonight? Just hear me out. Joy had a bad night and I don't know what's worse: the accident, or you not coming. You'd have to drive yourself. Nick and I aren't on speaking terms. I don't think so, Lars. I've had a plumber in. I'm not planning on showering. Yeah, no, that's not what I meant. I let someone come in, a stranger… thanks to you. Eline? I need time. Of course. Look at that, guys! Yes! Well played! OK, now it's sink or swim time. -Yeah. -Turn the cameras back on. -And go back to zombieland? -Nope. -But Lars will see us! -That's the idea. I told you I needed time. There's a crisis at work. I need to go there, now! And I'm at my work, Lars. You'll have to drive. I can't drive. Well, I don't want to. Not anymore. Phone a taxi. But the way they drive! And they're strangers! I told you, Eline: I trust you. -I can't just leave! -And I need to leave! Then I'm afraid you'll have to drive. Bye, Lars. Eline? Eli… Goddammit! -Hey. -Ah, Wannes! Snobbery isn't why he has a driver. I'm late for my consultations. -I know he's scared to drive. -Oh, you knew that? From Nick. -Did he say anything else? -He likes me. -About Lars. -He doesn't like him. No, that's wrong. He likes him, despite everything. -And the accident? -He really only had one beer. No, not that accident. The one with An-Sofie and Joy. I don't have time, I've a consultation. Mr Devos. Come in. Yes, Nick. Don't be afraid, OK? You too, Daddy. It will be fine. OK, come on. Thanks for making time. Now I'm not working for Lars… What really happened with Lars? Well, he doesn't want to talk about it. And I'm not that proud of it either. And you? Don't you want to talk about it, either? Not with anyone? I've put that and the rest of my past behind me. But my brother… Eline… If you can manage what I think you're trying to do, then you're naive. Give it here. How cool is that! And the bunker? Come on. Bye. -I know how the story moves forward. -Eline! Daddy drove the car and Uncle Nick finished the game and it's cool! Hi Joy! Ready for some more story? Yes. And you? Let's go. The king realised he'd shut everyone out of his life and that he was about to push the princess away, too. So he told her why he was afraid. Because that's what he was. Afraid. Of everything. Once, he'd been married to the queen and he was very happy. They often went to parties. They'd told me "the sky's the limit" and all that… HitGame's server's down. Oh! Want me to take a look? No, it's your party. I'll go. If you need a deputy… Then I'll let you know, but it's no problem. I'm sure I can fix it. Alright, thanks. Joy's tired. We won't stay long. I'll go straight home, OK? You can use my car. Ah, there's no need, we drove separately. Sweet dreams. I'll kiss you later. -Alright, good. -Are you coming back? To reboot everything will take at least four hours. We'll be cleared up by then! -Enjoy! Bye, darling! -Bye, darling! Are you tired? How dare you come here! Gert was my mate, too. Before you took him. Go home, Nick. You're drunk. Drunk? OK, bro. Leave my life until yours is on track. On track? Do you really mean that? What the fuck are you saying? Fuck, man, on track! It's alright. Come in. The queen had a secret. And the king's brother found out the secret. Nick? Have they thrown you out? I am outside, yes. Smoking a cigarette. Nice view. Enjoy. Let me work. Maybe you need to get your life on track. Yeah, whatever. I don't have time. And now? Where is she now?! She's gone. This is An-Sofie's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. An-Sofie, I can see you driving… Goddammit! No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! -Come on! -Daddy! Ow! Daddy! Ow. Daddy… -No, no, no, no… -Ow, Daddy! No! No! Daddy! -Daddy! -No, no! Fucking hell, no! The king felt betrayed and no longer trusted anyone. But he had so much love inside. Love that he gave to the princess. That's why you're set up like this and why no-one's allowed in. You have a strange form of mysophobia. The fear of… contaminating things with pleasant memories. What happens next? In the story? I wonder. Nick. The game is great, thanks to you. And thanks to my team, yes. Trust, exactly. Can you come over and look after Joy for a bit? Yes, of course I know I'll have to let you inside. Would you come over? I have to be somewhere. I… I came to… AN-SOFIE KESTENS 1986 - 2016 I want to forg… How? How can I forgive you? Cheating on me is one thing, but with our kid there? You took all my trust. It's rotting in your grave with you. You took my life away. You left me unable to face Joy. You left me unable to look in the mirror. But, An-Sofie… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. I KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS. LARS I have to forgive myself. But how do you do that? With a new beginning. Though you might make the same mistakes. Can I do that with you?
