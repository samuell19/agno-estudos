[Katherine] Okay, guys, we gotta go. [Aaron] Where's my Walkman? -Mom, Kim? -[bird chattering] And my shades, I... [Katherine] They're in the van, Aaron. Place always was a dump. Mom, Mom... -you're doing Bette Davis. -No, she said, "What a dump!" -Okay, we're outta here. -We are history. -[Katherine hisses] Yes! -This is us leaving, Leo. [bird chirps] [peaceful music plays] [birds chirping] [Aaron] Quaint. -Terminal, I'm afraid. -That's for the tourists, Aaron. Actually, Elm Creek was an old college town and an artist's colony. There's lots of culture. Yeah, but only here it's all in their yogurt. Funny. [plays harmonica] Aaron, Aaron, look, look. What? I don't see anything. No, there was this weird guy. He's gotta be weird, he's from here. -A freak from Elm Creek. -[Katherine] Aaron. -There it is. -[Kim] It's humongous. [Aaron] And old. Isn't it gorgeous? A lot bigger than that apartment, Iâ€™ll tell ya. Lots of lawn. There's the greenhouse. And is that a big beautiful porch or what? Oh, and back here, someday, a real greenhouse, beyond the trees there, filled with orchids and lilies, and a little veggie garden. Look, Mommy, it's half a swing. Well, don't worry, babe, we'll get it fixed. It's kinda neat though, hey. See the heart in the back? -[Kim] Cool. -[Katherine] Yeah. [Aaron] You said this needed a little work? This is a tear down. It's got potential. And termites and mice. And, uh... What's with that sign? We need the money. [Aaron] Yeah, but anyone who comes along could rent it. Aaron, listen, okay? It's a basement apartment, all right? It's totally separate. You are a big city paranoid, through and through. Yeah, well, what can I say? You raised me well. [chuckles] Thanks. Come on, let's go inside. Come on. [Kim] Come on, Leo. Mom, Leo likes it here. [Katherine] Excellent taste, huh? Excellent taste. Silence of the Lambs. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Actually, I used to live in a town just like this -when I was a little girl. -And she lived to tell about it. -[Kim giggles] -People were friendly, you didn't always have to look over your shoulder. -Oh, my God! -[gasps] Just joking, I got you all. [Katherine giggles] Very funny. Although, I did see this really scary movie on video. It was called Deliverance, and there were these hillbillies and what they did-- [Katherine] Okay, Aaron, that's enough. -No, anyway-- -Aaron! [Kim giggling] You... Anyway, I think you're really going to like it here. Both of you. I had to leave, you know that. Yeah. Yeah, I know. [radio plays rock music] [Aaron] Rock and roll! [Kim] Rock and roll! [laughing] [crickets chirping] [Kim] Mornin', Leo. [Leo chirps] How'd you sleep? [sighs] -Good morning. -[Aaron] No. Please. I'm growing older now and I need to make my own decisions. And the morning sucks. I'll be at the college till 4:00. Hey, no coffee. Faculty orientation. So, do I call you Professor now? Academician would be fine. How do I get around this burg, anyhow? Come here, I wanna show you something. Out that window. -No way. -Way. [birds tweeting] [rattling engine approaching] Holy... [engine starts] Son of a... [man] Gun. So, you got a little problem with your chain there. You can yank on that chain all day, it isn't gonna get any bigger. Here, see, the trick is, you wanna ease the chain onto the sprocket. Here. Like this. There we go. So, you got a room for rent? [Kim] My mom does. Well, I'd like to take it, if it's okay with you. What's your name? My name's Jack Beldon. What's yours? Kimberly. Well, it's very nice to meet you, Kimberly. And Leo. [Jack] And Leo. -[smooches] -[bird chirps] We come from Chicago. Oh, really? Well, Chicago, that's an awful big town. Lots of people and tall buildings. Trains. Cubs, and Bears, and Bulls. [Kim] We just moved here. We don't know anyone at all, do we, Leo? [Aaron] I'll, uh... I'll tell my mom you were here. You do that. I'll see you later. What'd I tell you about talking to strangers, huh? You talked to him. I answered his questions, Kim. And I didn't even have to do that. He's a stranger. And you never trust strangers. Let's see. This can be your bird bath hot tub. And when the weather is just right you can come out and make friends with all the other birds in the neighborhood. We need water from a hose. A hose, a hose... Hmm... A hose. A hose! There's one, Leo. [straining] -[hisses] -[screams] Mommy! [Katherine] Aaron, I don't want you crawling under there. I'm sure it was him, Eddie Lester. Local character. He's harmless enough. -Oh, good. -Harmless? [Waller] You okay, Kimberly? -She's all right. -[Waller] Well, that's good. Is that apple pie I smell? I love apple pie. Well, as soon as we perfect it, we'll have you over for dinner. That'd be awful nice... Katherine. Well, there's other guys with slicker come-ons than Waller. Come on, Aaron, just because some guy acts nice, you feel threatened. [Aaron] You know I'm just trying to watch for you, right? [Katherine] I know. At least I think I know. Funkmeister! What? [girl] There he is! This night vision is way cool. [Patrick] Look! The Creeper's making a move. Where'd you say you got this thing? -It's my pop's. -Shh! Army reserve. I say we nail him. Come on, guys. That's my call, Hetty. [Aaron] I'm full. Come on, eat your vegetables, Aaron. -[Aaron] I need a barf bag. -[Katherine] Aaron! [screams] Mine! Mom, he stole our pie. Aaron! Where are you going? [Hetty] Come on. Let's go! Go! Go! Go! [Patrick] Oh, yeah, we got him this time. Mommy, it was that... that-- that guy that we drove by! That weird guy! [Patrick] Hurry up! Come on, let's go! [all whooping] [Patrick] Come on. Faster! Faster! [Wimpy] Oh, man. [Patrick] Crummy old geezer. Get back here! -Hurry up, guys. Let's go. -[boy] Woohoo! [laughs] What a dorky set of wheels! Look at the goof on the antique. [grunts] [Patrick] Way to go, dorkwad. Bunch of hillbillies! Hey, that was quite a wipe out. My name's Hetty Ryan, jump on. [Patrick] There he is. Over there! Hurry up, guys, come on! Come on, you guys, faster! Come on, come on, quick, quick, quick! Come on, let's go. [Wimpy] Watch out! He's nasty! [panting] -[shrieks] -[Patrick] Get him! Get him! All right, he's headed for Main Street. [Hetty] There he is, they've got him cornered! Let's get him! [Patrick] Creeper! Creeper! Where'd you get that pie from, Creeper? -[Patrick] Hey, Creeper! -[boy] Hey, Creeper! How's the pie there, Creeper? [Patrick] Come on, let's go. [Eddie] You! [Patrick] Quick, Hetty, get the pie! [Hetty] Sorry, Creeper! [Eddie] My pie! Here's your pie, dorkwad. Thanks, doofus! [Patrick] Let's go, guys. Come on, let's go. Let's get outta here! Hurry up, guys! Disgusting. -Is there a problem? -[engine rattling] [Hetty] I flooded it! [Aaron] Unflood it! He's got a knife! [engine starts] [Hetty] Let's go! Get in! [Aaron] Take that, Creeper! -Let's go, let's go! -[Hetty] Hang on! Boogers! -Come back here! -[Aaron] He's gaining! [Eddie] I'll getcha! I'll getcha! I'll getcha! [Aaron] Killer go-cart! [Hetty] You wanna race it sometime? Hey, I'll catch you later. [Aaron] Okay. Phew, this is one weird town. And I thought Chicago was nuts. [crickets chirping] -[woman screams] -[horse grunts] [grunting and screaming] [grunting and struggling] [panting] Mom, I've got a great idea. Mom, can I give Leo some arugula seeds? Sure. Hey, Kim. [gasps, grunts] Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. -Here. -That's all right. Jack was here yesterday, about the room. [Jack] Yeah, um... Oh, Jack Beldon. Katherine Tomlinson. -Yeah, nice to meet you. -[Katherine] Yeah. So, are you from around here? No, I just got into town a couple of days ago and I saw the sign. Right. Well, I think the room's already been-- You know, this is a really beautiful... what, 19th century Victorian? Neo-classical. Yeah. That's right. Looks like you're kind of short on help. Is there anything I can do around here? Like what? Well, you're renovating, aren't you? Well, I'm pretty handy with a hammer and a saw. You know how to renovate a house? Sure. Well, your painter over there, maybe he was up all night partying last night, but he really ought to be priming that wood. Otherwise, you're gonna need more paint, and you're going to spend a lot more time in the long run. -[Aaron] Mom. -It's all right. [Jack] This bannister's wobbly. Might be some dry rot. Also, before closing up those walls up there, I'd strap down that plumbing, unless, of course, you like the sound of rattling pipes in the morning. [chuckles] Okay, sure, you can help. You'll just have to talk to the general contractor first. Now, Mom, we ought to think about this first. Aaron, he has just shown us four problems already. [siren blares in distance] [Aaron] The Creeper. [Patrick] So, when did this happen? -[Hetty] Last night. -[Wimpy] Was he arrested -for stealing the pie? -No, it's a lot bigger than that. Well, look who it is. Nice bike, dorkwad. Hey, work on your diss-drives, lame stain. Dork went out with disco. What's going on? Murder. All right. There's nothing here for you to see. Let's go. -[Patrick] Yeah, right, buddy! -Nelson, no. There he is. He did it. That's what my dad said. -[Patrick] No doubt about it. -[indistinct radio chatter] [indistinct chatter] [Waller] Look, I can't answer everyone's questions all at once! Cause of death? It appears to have been strangulation from a chain or a necklace of some kind. Necklace? [reporter] Can you confirm the motive was robbery? -[indistinct chatter] -[office phone ringing] The safe was emptied. There were signs of forced entry. You draw your own conclusions. We're still working on ours. Are you holding an Eddie Lester, is that correct? I hope not, he's right outside. Eddie Lester was questioned. He's not a suspect at this time. -[man] He oughta be. -He is one weird dude. Pamela told me he prowled around her place all the time. Wasn't Terri out there a couple of times? Terri? Yeah, yeah. I was out there once, last year I think it was. All Eddie Lester was doin' was feedin' the squirrels. Why can't you just lock him up, John? Larry, I got nothing to hold him on! Now, listen, please! I've been authorized by the town council to offer a reward. [man 2] How much? Ten thousand dollars. [woman] Ten thousand dollars? [Waller] For any information leading to... Ten grand, not bad, huh? [Waller] ...the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for this crime. This is a tragedy for all of us. I knew Pam very well. She was a good friend. [woman] We all knew Pam. We all knew her. Come on. We'll get him. You can count on it. What the devil! [indistinct chatter and laughter] Yo, I need some more of these big nails. They're in a box over there by the corner. [chuckles] Go on. Thank you, sir. Oh, Aaron, see this? Now, that's called a hammer. Now, we're a little short around here. We need someone to help us pull out some old nails. You know... What do you say? Good. Well, hey, it's your house. [birds chirping] Lookin' good. Where you from? Chatham. Oh, yeah? I have a cousin around there. Where about in Chatham? Near a river. A river? [Jack] I wasn't there very long. I'm never anywhere very long. Hey Salvio. Check out that window frame over by the front door. I think the wood's a little warped. This is what you do? Well... makes the ends meet. Sort of. Pays my rent for my room downstairs. I'm telling you, this wood's green. You nail this up, in three months your walls are going to buckle. -It's an old trick. -Wait a minute! I hired you, you work for me. I work for her. And if anything's going down here, she's gonna know about it. Is this true? Mrs. Tomlinson, I would build my own house out of this wood. [chuckles] He means his outhouse out of this wood. [grunts] -Stop! -[contractor] No! [contractor choking] [gasping] You're fired. Understand? Get out of here! That still doesn't change the condition of this wood. -So, is it green? -[door closes] I'm sorry, Mrs. Tomlinson, but if you can't trust your own contractor... Bobby, Salvio, let's go! [Aaron] What if Delaney hadn't wimped out? How far would Jack have gone then? What is your problem? He was just defending himself. [plates clatter] You don't understand, Aaron. If we go ahead and fix this house at anything more than Delaney's prices, we can't afford the mortgage. Hey, it's country rustic, I can live with it. [Kim] Mom, I'm ready! [knocking on door] Hey. Hey, looks like dinner. No, no, it's fine. Come on in. Really. Are you hungry? There's plenty. [Jack] No, no, no, I'm fine, thanks. I just wanted to apologize for this afternoon. I got kind of amped. I just don't like seeing people taken advantage of. Guy was a jerk. Are you sure you don't want a coffee or something? No, no. I'm fine, really. [Kim] Mom, come on! Yeah, go ahead and fill the tub, honey. [water running] I wanna run your job. Take over as contractor. -[chuckles] -Oh, I've built houses before. But I'm not asking you to take that on face value. We'll take it one day at a time, and if you're satisfied, fine, if not... Um, that-- that's a very nice offer. You're kind of in the lurch here, and... well, I guess I feel responsible for that. Anyway, I sure could use the money. [Kim] Mommy! Excuse me, I've gotta go put her in the tub. But we'll talk. Say, why don't you take a break? I want to show you something outside. Woah! It's beautiful. It's amazing what a can of Krylon and a grease gun will do. -Glad you like it. -[window slides open] [Katherine] All right. Last chance. Lasagna and Caesar salad. Oh, well, if you insist, I'd appreciate it. [chuckles] Okay. [truck reversing signal beeps] [windows smash] Hey, the Creepers a pack rat. He keeps everything. Including Pamela Martin's silver. Maybe even the necklace. And if we find the necklace, it's ten grand, baby. -You're outta your mind! -[impersonates chicken] Look, you saw what happened the other night, okay? Guy pulled a knife on us! It got a little close for comfort. It's different, you'll have plenty of warning. As soon as Wimp sees him, he screams his head off and you're out of there. He's going inside, what're you gonna do? Ten grand, huh? You can rent every video ever made. I want fifty per cent of the whole deal, then I'm in. Wait a minute! Hetty! It's my butt, freeze-dry. All you gotta do is run around with his backpack. That's bull, I... Fine. It's your gig. Good luck. Wait a minute. Deal. [Aaron] Cool, let's do it. Hetty, Hetty! We're getting ripped off! [metallic jangling] [jingling] [screeching] Hey, Creeper! Does this look familiar? You want this? Come get it! -Come on, Creeper! -[growls] [Patrick] Come on, Creeper! [Patrick] Aaron, go! Hurry up! What're you waiting for? Use your flashlight. [growls] [roars] [panting] The Creeper's got him! Come on, let's get outta here. Who's gonna pay for him? Three for a dollar. But only on Tuesdays. [in deep voice] Fella, you got a big thirst? Have you got a big thirst? Absolutely. Now, if I could, you know, just find that bar. Who does he think he is? [imitating woman] I wanna call the police on you. You are disgusting. [normal voice] Disgusting! Disgusting! Three for a dollar. Right where it goes. But who knows who sews? Or someone else dies. [chuckles] Have you gotta big thirst? Three for a dollar. -But only on Tuesdays. -Hm? [sighs] Who sews? -[Aaron] I'm home. -[Katherine] Aaron? Where have you been? Aaron, what happened? Who put this on you anyway? Sure doesn't look like any doctor's work I've ever seen. Aaron, who put this on you? Oh, my God! This is awful. Let me see. You got these skipping stones? That's as bad as I wanna be. Very funny. All right, Aaron, I want the truth. Now. Okay. Hatchet throwing contest. Joke. It was a joke, Mom. Very funny. I was just screwing around in a junk yard and I fell. Seriously. Oh, yeah? I don't want you going out at night anymore. -What? -Well, it appears to be -very dangerous. -You're joking, right? No, I am not! Especially in junkyards. [Aaron] Hello? We just talked business. Anyways, he says he can do it. We don't even know the guy and now he's renovating our house. And that's all he's doing, Aaron. Look, we're gonna take it a step at a time, all right? And so far, I'd say the guy's doing a pretty good job. So, give him a break, okay? Well, I guess I oughta wait and see what the other guy looks like. What? The guy that gave you that on your head. No one gave me this to me. Well, that's a big job, varnishing the staircase and the newel post. Newel? Weird word. Yeah, I guess it is when you think about it. You know, uh... I appreciate you giving me a chance here. Well, hey, it's not my house, it's my mom's. Yeah, well, it was your call, too. You know, it's pretty obvious... your mom looks up to you. So does your sister. I can see why they look to you. But at the same time, it's no picnic, being the man of the house. It's tough enough when you're grown up... but at your age, without a father... Oh, expectations and pressure. It can't be a whole heck of a lot of fun. What about your dad? My daddy hung in there till I was about nine. Then, one day, he just... Let's see, what's the line? He... skipped the light fantastic right out of town. Skipped the light fantastic. [scoffs] I always loved that. What about your old man? He died when I was about six. Anyone after him? [sighs] Well, there was one guy, but... he didn't last long. He was a real jerk to my mom. [whispers] Ah. Thanks for the bike. [scoffs] Anytime, buddy. You know... sometimes you wanna leave something behind. Just a... sign or an emblem to show that you were there. Proves that you were living there and... doin' something worthwhile. Here. Look at that. [scoffs] Lucky horseshoe, that's me. I think it's a good idea. Cool. [exhales] [light hammering] Where can I make my mark? [chuckles] Not on your head. [both chuckle] [birds chirping] [Katherine] Aaron. I just got a call from Waller. He said something about the Creeper? And about how some kid was having nightmares and told his father. -[Waller] Go on, son. -He grabbed me. How? Like this. [Patrick] Hey! Is that when he lashed you with the car antenna? [Aaron] He didn't lash me with a car antenna. -That's what you said. -Did not. -Tell him about the knife. -He knows about the knife. I need to hear it from you, son. He just tried to scare me with it, that's all. You saw this knife? Gleaming in the moonlight. [Wimpy] Tell him about his breath, being as hot as a blowtorch. [Aaron] You're dreamin' again, homie! He didn't' really do anything at all. He's just a weird guy. Find him. Good night, Bob. Thanks again. He didn't do it. I've seen weird people before, really weird. I'm from Chicago. And I can always tell which ones are scary... and which ones are just... weird. -[Katherine] Jack, hi. Let's... -[Jack] Woah! -[Katherine giggles] -[Jack] Watch your head! You know him? He's working on our house. Him? [chuckles] Pamela Martin's maid said there was some man working on the house a couple of weeks before the murder. Never got a good look at him though. Did you question Jack? Oh, yeah. [Aaron] What'd he say? He never laid eyes on her. Hey. How's it goin'? Got any more of that green wood lately? Well... now you got someone new on the job. Someone honest. Someone you can trust. Count the supplies, kid. The new stuff arrives at the job site, count everything. The paint, the wood, the sheetrock. 'Cause all I know is, every time I drive by that place, things seem a little low to me. Oh, and your mom? I'd watch out for her, too. What do you know about him? Aaron, don't change the subject. No, no! Why was he drivin' our van? Or is that part of his salary? Has he got keys to the house? The house is under construction. So he can come in here, any time of the day, day or night. -Aaron. -[Aaron] No, Mom. You want me to be careful, fine. I'll be careful. And how about you? Aaron, is there something you're not telling me? That guy out there is saving our bacon, all right? So, before you crucify anybody, you make darn sure you know exactly who they are. Wow, you sure you weren't in the construction trade in another life? What'd Waller have to say? Nothing. Nothing? Well, you guys were sure talking for a long time about nothing. You sure it didn't have something to do with that poor woman who got herself murdered? [bird cawing] [Jack chuckling] Small towns and small minds. They questioned me for two hours just 'cause I'm not from around here. Can you believe it? So, you were a suspect? Well, give the man a cigar! [chuckles] Why'd the police think you might've done it? Oh, skip it. I know all this stuff about facing things and everything, but, well, sometimes it's better to just skip it. You know, that business with that weird guy out at the automobile graveyard? Eddie Lester? Stay out of that. I know these towns, I know these people. Just when you think you understand what's going on... they get you in their web. They want their meat, Aaron. You let 'em have it. You let 'em have it. That's a shame. Chris said the same thing, stuff's missing. Not just supplies, but tools. I knew stuff was missing. I just knew it. What do you know about this guy? Nothing. Not a thing. Maybe it wasn't him. No, these guys, they're my friends. I've known 'em my whole life. They don't steal. Hey, sorry I'm late. This business with the numbers just goes on and on. Thanks for tucking her in. Okay? I said I was sorry. It's not that. Well, if it's about Jack, he's doing a great job. I don't think he's doing such a great job. The guy's ripping us blind. Tools are missing, supplies disappearing... Do you have any proof, any reason to suspect-- People are coming to me, all right? And if you weren't so busy having beers with the guy all the time... That's enough all right! I'm sick and tired of apologizing for things you know nothing about! Are things getting bad again? Not if I can help it. So, is it true? Are some things missing? Yes. Did I steal anything? No. Somehow, those two things don't quite connect. Well, I guess there's just no question about it then, is there? What would that question be? Can you trust me? Come here. [Katherine] Where are you taking me? [Jack] Behind the tree line. You said you wanted a greenhouse. I've been workin' on it when you're not here. Where no one could see what I was building. [Katherine] Jack, I'm sorry. Enjoy it. He should have told us. What's the big secret? Mom? Mom? Hey! They got him cornered down in the yard. They got guns, SWAT team, dogs, and everything. It's gonna be great! Come on, let's do it. [dogs barking] [Hetty] There he is! See him? -[dogs barking] -[sirens blaring] [indistinct chatter] See him? Oh, man, I have a really bad feeling about this. [police officer] Fan out! Watch every vehicle! [dogs barking] [metallic jingling] [indistinct chatter] [officer 1] Did you see him? [officer 2] Sarge, come on! Sarge, over here! Over here! [officer] Send somebody this way! Come on. [grunting] No, stop! Stop! Stop! Help me! Oh, stop! No, no, no! No! No! Hey! Hey! [Eddie screams] [dogs barking] [officer] He's dead, chief. Real dead. [grunting] [romantic music playing in distance] [romantic music becomes louder] Women. [boy] One, please. Thanks a lot. [Aaron] Two, please. No, I'm tellin' you. He kept the necklace inside the potato sack! [laughs] Can you imagine? You keep all that junk inside a washing machine? -[Aaron] What necklace? -[Hetty] Aaron? Earth to Aaron. [Aaron] Oh, sorry. Popcorn. Large. [Waller] So, what are you saying, Aaron? I'm saying I think he was framed. You nailed the wrong guy. I'll tell you what I think. You're freaked out, your heart's pounding. So, when you pull out that bag, it coulda been filled with barbells! Besides, Lester's prints are all over the stuff. [Aaron] Oh, come on, he was a pack rat, everybody knew that. I looked in his eyes. Just like I'm looking at you now. And I saw... he wasn't the killer. At least I don't think so. You seem pretty broken up about this, Aaron, how come? Because I helped kill him. Well... Oh, man! There you go. Pour me a coffee, please, there, Terri. Sure. [indistinct chatter and laughter] [upbeat music playing] Hey. [man] Hi, house looks great. Thanks. [Katherine] Oh, hi. Come on in. Glad you could make it. [woman] Your house looks wonderful. [Katherine] Thanks. [Hetty] Aaron, heard you went to the cops yesterday. Small town. Yeah. I got the dirt on Jack. So, what'd you find out? He was in trouble a few years ago in some town, south of here. -Chatham. -Maybe. I heard it was a big deal. There was a trial, people thought for sure he was guilty. He got off. That's all I know. [Waller] Right over here, Beldon. I got your number, Beldon, or Lowe, whatever your name is. [scoffs] All you got is a badge and a lot of bad breath. Well, I'm gonna get you. Believe it. And when I do, the only renovation job you're gonna get is a ten by ten-foot cell you can really call home. [chuckles] You got a charge, make it. Otherwise get out of my face. [Jack grunts] Go ahead, don't let the badge stop you. Yeah, right. Let go of me, Waller. You got Katherine fooled and the kids, but not me. -You make one wrong move... -[door closes] -[crickets chirping] -[dogs barking in distance] [sighs] [Aaron] Jim Lowe. Jim... Hetty. Hey, hot shot. How you doing? I was just doing a little favor for your mom. Boy, she and your sister, they're quite the readers, huh? Hey, I think you might need a little more light on the subject. That's not good for your eyes. [Hetty] Hey, Aaron! Did you find that article on largemouth bass fishing? Hey, Hetty. Gotta love those bass. So, you guys goin' fishin', huh? Huh, good luck. [door closes] [Hetty] First, they said it was an accident. Then the police said it wasn't. But the gas line was cut and the whole house just blew up. Everyone was killed. Including his wife. The lady had a lot of money and he was in line to get it all. But there was something in the will, some family thing, and he didn't get a nickel. -[Aaron] Oh, man. -[indistinct chatter] Coulda been an accident. [sighs] -[Aaron] Look at 'em. -[indistinct chatter] [Kim laughing] You gotta tell her, Aaron. [Kim squeals] [librarian] Did you find what you were looking for? The other night. [Aaron] Oh, yeah, um, thanks. Good. I guess that makes two of you. Excuse me? You and the other fellow. He asked for the same newspaper, same issue, right after you left. He, uh.. He didn't have these cheesy tattoos on his fingers, did he? Yes, as a matter of fact, he did. [owl hoots] [Hetty shuddering] If we get caught, are we gonna go to jail? [Aaron] We're not gonna get caught. The cops thought he was here before the murder, but he denied it, and they couldn't prove it. [Hetty] But why do we have to go inside, Aaron? This is where she died. [Aaron] He leaves this thing at the bottom of the staircase. The newel. He leaves his "sign", his "emblem". You're not talking about a dead body. No, no, it's, uh, it's his little secret. [sighs] All right, so we break in, check the bottom of the staircase or whatever, and if it's there, what? He was here. [Aaron] Careful. Watch your hands on the glass. I don't like this. And I don't like that. [sighs] He wasn't here. Let's go. Wait. Will you just hurry up? I'm hurrying, okay? Let's go. Wait. Why don't we just leave? Lucky horseshoe. That's Jack. Who's that? Oh, my God, Aaron. He followed us. [panting] Is he-- Oh, my God, is he gonna kill us? No, let's go. -[Aaron] You first. -[Hetty] No, you! -[Aaron] You. -[Hetty] Go! [Aaron whispering] Come on! Head for town. -[Nichols] Hey! -[Aaron] Too late! -[screams] -You little punks. [Aaron] We were just fooling around, okay? [Hetty] You know, haunted houses. Woooo! I dare ya, I double dare ya. Get a load of them. I know what you think of me, Aaron. I know what you think of this entire town. But we're investigating a murder here. So, can the attitude, okay? Why are you here? [Nichols] House is under surveillance. Oh, really? You were right, Aaron. It wasn't Eddie Lester. [Waller] Aaron... you, your mother, and your sister are in grave danger. I can't help you unless you help me. [Nichols] Uh, where're you goin'? Don't we get one phone call? Your mom's boyfriend was here before the murder. And your point being? You're quite a detective. So, how do you know it wasn't Lester? We had forensics do a test on the silver. They found some circular brush marks that only a power buffer could have made. So? So, Pamela Martin's maid polished the silver by hand. And I doubt very seriously that Eddie Lester was into power tools. Doesn't mean it was Jack. Maybe not. But the buffer had a flaw, they think it was a burnt bearing. The scratches were all wavy. Yeah? So what? So, you match the buffer to the swirl marks on the silver... [chuckles] It's like a finger print. What you say you and me have a private chat? Doesn't anyone care what I think? [Waller] Not really, sit down. You weren't supposed to hear that last part. That's strictly conjecture. My lips are sealed. Well, that's not what I'm talking about. I don't want you poking around anymore, trying to find any more of your evidence. Jack Beldon may have murdered two women. I want you to think about that. I know the type. They make themselves into exactly what you want, what your mother wants. They got eyes, Aaron, growing out the back of here. So, I'm telling you again, just stay out of it, okay? If you ever see anything weird or outta the ordinary or even if you just wanna talk, you give me a call. -[blows] -[party horns blare] Thank you. Ooh, this looks very enticing. This box. -[gasps] -[chuckles] That is... Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. [Katherine] Hey. Okay, Aaron, come on, let's have it. I can take it. [Aaron] It's his whole deal. It's not right. It never was right. I mean, one minute he's working on our house and the next he's in our house and our lives. You don't know him. -And you do. -[Aaron] Nobody does. Aaron, come here for a sec. Come here. You're afraid. I mean, I'm afraid-- No, no, you're not. Not the way you should be. I love him, Aaron. I mean, can't you understand that? [sighs] [sighs] Mom, I have to tell you something. Honey, I have something I'd like to tell you. Jack's asked me to marry him. [Aaron] What? And what did you say? I said yes. I love him, Aaron. I love him so much. [audience] Woah! Woah. Is that all you can say? Woah! I'm gonna tell her, I just gotta do it right. Well, how 'bout this. " "Hey, Mom, Mr. Perfect slays widows for breakfast." We don't know that, Hetty. Not for sure. Sometimes he seems like-- He seems like a really nice guy. I'm gonna do it, okay? I just wanna know for sure. Wait. He just started his new job, and they're still tearing down the place, right? So, he leaves most of his tools in the garage and greenhouse. And when he does he leave? -[chuckles] -[clicks fingers] [wolf howls] [sighs] No buffer. Buffer. [drill whirrs] [gasps] Oh, God, Aaron. Hetty, out. [Aaron] You lied to the police, why? Why? You were at Pamela Martin's. Don't deny it! Aaron, I didn't have anything to do with that. You lied! Who else knows, Aaron? Besides you and Hetty. Come on, now, Aaron. Who else knows? Waller. He's got you spying on me now, doesn't he? Woah! Come here, now. Before you go jumping to conclusions... I want you to remember one thing: these small town cops are all snakes, Aaron, I mean that. A safe full of goodies? A cop everybody trusts? He steals it. Then when the heat's on, he plants it on Eddie Lester. Oh, come on, now, that is an option, isn't it? Aaron, Aaron, listen. You gotta believe me. I didn't have anything to do with Pamela Martin, nothing! Oh, come on, Aaron. You can't give in to 'em. They'll twist your head around 'til you start seein' things that aren't even there. They'll call you paranoid, oh, yeah, you're seeing things. Only the sick thing is, the sick thing is you start believing them. Then the knives come out. And every fear, every hatred you ever had is pointing you right in the back. Come on, Aaron, don't plant the seed. [sighs] [announcer] Next up for the time trials is newcomer, Aaron Tomlinson. This is his time trial run. [Hetty] You have to brake as soon as you let off the gas, then gun it into the curve. -Don't wimp out... -[engine rumbling] ...because you'll get into more trouble on the drift then you would with strong acceleration. [indistinct chatter on loudspeaker] I don't see your mom. Well, you know, I decided it'd be best if... Look, I didn't tell her, okay? She'd totally freak out. So, Jack came instead? -Jack's here? -Over by the far turn. Better go. Ready? -[gunshot] -[Aaron] Go! Go! [announcer] Well, Tomlinson's on his way! And it looks like a good start, too. [engines roar] [announcer] Tomlinson's into the far turn with what might be a winning time. Brake, brake. [Aaron] Come on. Come on. -[engine roars] -Woah! [announcer] Looks to me like Tomlinson's having some kind of trouble on... Aaron! [announcer] Oh, my goodness, is there a doctor in attendance? Can we get a doctor in the far turn bank immediately? Woah! [announcer] Is there a doctor in attendance? [Patrick] Hey, buddy! Buddy! Are you okay? [Hetty] Aaron! Aaron! [water trickling] [sighs] [Kim sighs] I'm going to put you in a magic circle, Aaron. Then you'll be all better. Then there won't be any more bad things happening. Not to you, or me, or any mean old boyfriends for mommy. Aaron? Mommy! I'm coming. I'm coming. Eggs, bacon, chewy, not crispy. [sighs] Welcome back, stranger. -Easy. -[Katherine giggles] How you feeling? [Katherine] What's the matter? Get... him... out of here. Honey, Jack's just concerned about you. [Katherine] One more. -There you go. -[spoon clinks] You try and get some sleep, okay? Mom. [Katherine] Yeah, what's the matter? He tried to kill me. Who? Aaron! The brakes didn't just go out, somebody cut them. It was a setup, like everything else. Now, there are things I know and there are things he doesn't want you to know. About his past, about what happened to him. He was married before. Yes and she got killed, maybe even murdered. He was under suspicion. The cops thought he did it. Now, Mom, you have to believe me. You have to. I'm not making any of this up. I swear to God, I swear. It's all there, and it's all in the papers. My God, Aaron, don't you think I already know? I know everything. Everything. And it doesn't matter. Aaron, honey, you have got to let go. -This pain, this paranoia. -What about Pamela Martin? He was there before she died. He lied to the police. He was a suspect. He's the only suspect. -But Eddie Lester-- -Framed. -Oh, God. -By Jack. Mom, it's not me saying it! It's the cops. Call them. Go ahead, call them. Call them. He had to. What? He had to, Aaron. What else could he have done? -Mom. -No, listen to me. You know his past. You saw what they did to that homeless man. Aaron, think about it. What would you have done? He had to. I'm really tired. I'm gonna get some sleep. Aaron. I'm really tired. Honey, please. [sighs] [Waller] Glad you called, Aaron. [Waller] Plane flies in from the coast, dips down inside the canyon, and it's invisible to radar. And down there, that's where they landed. Where they unloaded, and picked up the drugs. See, you can even see the tire tracks. Pamela Martin? Well, we checked her safe, Aaron. We found traces of cocaine. She had a pilot's license. This is her land. During Prohibition, they used to run rum right along this river. I guess they just sort of updated it. Never really made sense to me, you know, someone killing for some silver and a few Krugerrands. Unless there was something else in that safe. Something a lot more valuable. [birds cawing] Was that an accident? I don't know. Don't know about anything anymore. Or anybody. We're close, Aaron. A piece or two more and we can arrest him. Can you hold up? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. You got my card. You gonna be home tonight? Yeah. Simpsons are on. You shouldn't have told her, Aaron. Now you planted a seed. That seed's gonna grow. It always does. Why did you do it? Why? We had something, all of us. I mean, you knew it, we... We had something perfect. [chuckles] You know what? We're puppets. Yeah, you and me, we're puppets. You're the victim and I'm the killer. But I'm not the one pulling the strings. Understand? Now, we gotta stick together, you and me. If we can't trust each other... we're dead. All right? All right, go on. [sniffing] [sniffing] Oh, God. [hissing] [hissing continues] [Aaron screams] Mom! [indistinct chatter on radio] [woman] What are all these cops doing? [officer] Hey, look at this. Over here, I found something. [Katherine] It's gonna be okay, baby. We'll get another bird, okay? It's okay, Kim. You'll be okay. We'll take you to Terri's place. You'll be safe there. You can rest at my place. [siren blares] Half an hour ago, Jack Beldon was pulled over. He ran. They think he's headed for the border. Hey. Hey. Aaron, you gotta hold together. Your mom and your sis are depending on you. Okay? Well, the doctor gave your mother something to help her sleep. She was pretty upset. We figured this was as good a place as any to keep an eye on everybody. Terri says she's got everything under control. You can stay here as long as you want. Okay? Oh, Aaron. You were right. You were right all along. I'm so sorry. It doesn't matter, Mom. It doesn't matter. Not anymore. Just go to sleep. I love you. I love you too, Mom. Take it easy, Aaron. Darn. Cheap buttons. Terri, sew that on for me, would you? [Terri] Yeah, later. [Eddie] Who knows? Who sews? Mom. Mom. Guess what! You know what? I think it could be one of them. Or it could be all of them. Mom, Mom, please wake up! Please! Oh, God. [gasps] She needs her sleep, Aaron. [Waller] Aaron. I'm going to be heading off now. If you need anything, anything at all... you just ask Terri. Hey, how about some milk and cookies, okay? Come on. [ringing tone] Come on, Hetty. Come on. -[Hetty] Hello? -Yeah, Hetty, it's me. Aaron, I beat up Patrick today. What? Why? [Hetty] He was the one that cut the brake line on the go-cart. -You sure? -He confessed. Listen, Aaron, I'm sorry about everything. -It's okay, just-- -Uh-uh. This line is for official police business only. -[dialing tone] -Aaron? Chocolate chip? Cookies. Slobs. I like things neat. I notice when things are out of place. Just like you. I'm gonna get some sleep, I'm really tired. Oh, come on. Stay and keep me company. Come on. Just for a bit. Yeah, it's the details. It's those little things that slip by. She was from the city. She bought a big hunk of property. Wanted to play the country girl. And it was perfect. Except for a stupid plane that buzzed by every once in a while. Yeah, that's how it all started. She complains to Waller, and, of course, I'm the one who gets stuck with going out there. We'll just send dumb ol' Terri! I told her there was nothing unusual. Guess what? She decides to play detective. Just like you. You know, I believe the term is eminent domain. I had been using that strip for years, long before she ever showed up. I wasn't hurting anyone. But new owners... they can get pretty nosy. She actually hid in the bushes with binoculars, can you believe it? Yeah, she takes down my license number. If her horse hadn't snorted, I'd be doing forty right now. -[Aaron] Help! -Waller! Somebody help! -Nichols... -[Arron] Help! Help! Children, playing cops. Help! Help! [Jack] Aaron! The only one in this entire town who knows the truth... is you, Aaron! Help me! Somebody! -Help! -[handcuffs clicking] I didn't want to kill her. She made me. Come on. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! You gotta wake up! -Aaron, he's in trouble! -[screams] "I didn't hear him leave. I was sleepin'. Jeez, I'd been up all night, I had to sleep. He looked up to you, Chief Waller. Where were you? He needed you, you weren't there." That's good. [laughs] That's good. We're gonna have the whole town guilty as can be by the time I'm through. Jack. Jack. Help! No! No! No! No! Please! No! Jack! Jack! Help! [sirens blare] No! It's her, she's got the boy! [Aaron] Jack! -Don't shoot! -[gunshot] -[glass smashes] -[Aaron] Jack! Jack! Jack! [Jack] Trying to stop it! Aaron! [Aaron] Jack! Jack, are you all right? Jack! [engine stops] Stay put! I'm gonna get you outta there. [Waller] Careful, I don't know how to operate this thing. Aaron, can you open that window? Now, give me your hand, I'll pull you outta there. Come on. You know, I don't think I can. Come on, Aaron. Trust me. There you go. All right. That's it! That's it! There we go! [grunts] Good. All right, we jump on three. One, two, three, jump! [grunts] Hey, how ya doin'? You okay? [panting] I'm sorry. I'm sorry I never believed you. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay from now on. [engine rumbles] Look out! [birds chirping] Polly, here's the thing. It's a wonderful town, and the people here are really nice. It'll just take a while to get used to them. Trust me. [groans] That oughta do it. She should stop on a dime now. [Hetty] Thanks, Jack. [Aaron] Thanks, Jack. That's great. Yeah! [engine rumbles] [Aaron] Woo! Woo!
