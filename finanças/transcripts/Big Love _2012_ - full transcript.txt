Two beers, please. Look, a smoke swallower. Get some water. What the fuck? Get away from my girl! Call an ambulance! Now! You should exhale smoke, not swallow. I swallow. Emilia, hurry up! The math teach's coming! Fresh stuff. Wanna hear? Cool. I've never been here before. They wanted to build a bridge here. That is all that's left. And what's there? There? This is a place for contemplating music together. With your dad, mom, mustachioed uncle... And...? See you soon? What's wrong? Your phone... I won't give it to you. But I'll give you my phone number. - Yes? - 272348. Bye! You're new. And I'm hereto help you. I can't help when you refuse to talk. You've kept quiet for six years. And you want to keep it that way. But I've no time. Goodbye. May 14th, 2004, 11:12 PM. Interrogation of Maciej Dolny. Was it' the first time you had sex with this underage girl? Did you know she was a virgin? Of course I knew. Zander. The Polish Theater won the mos! prestigious award at the New York Ar! Festival for 'Anna Karenina '1 Actress Maria Baumgart received the Special Award... Maria Shitgart. Our thespians will return home fomorrow. - Emilia! My dearest daughter! - Hi, Mum. - How did you like New York? - Wait a moment. - This is my... - Driver. Chauffer Maciej at your service. Maria Baumgart, nice to meet you. - When will you tour again? - Just a moment. It's nice... it's cool that you've come here. Emilia's never picked me up. - Will you drive me home? - No problem. Please, just a few words... Will you wait for me? Five minutes, no more... Let's go. - What about your mother? - She can manage. Who would've thought I'd screw the daughter of famous Dr Dagmara? You did screw her fine. Who would've thought the daughter of famous Dr Dagmara would ask for more? Fuck! What's wrong? Fuck! It's your fault! I keep looking at you, not the indicators. Do you have to be so pretty? Anyway, you're the best driver in the world. I know that, because I didn't want to puke. With other drivers I always want to puke. I need to pee. "I need to pee, Oh can't you see..." - Good voice. - Bullshit. I should know. I was a drummer in a punk band. - Really? - Al the high school. - Why don't you play any more? - The army killed the artist in me. Along with biochemistry. Think I can make it into the Vocal Department at the Conservatory? Sure. Some perverts tied him to a tree. He would sit there all week. He's cool. I'm gonna call him George. - What? - George. That was my father's name. He died before I could see him. So now my father's going to be my dog. Can we take him? I'm gonna look after him. My mother would never agree, so maybe at your place... With me as a bonus. Maciej? Can I ask you something? Do all guys have such hard-ons when they sleep? I don't know. I do. But you know what? Maybe my dream turned me on. I had an amazing dream. Me, too! Please wail for me. I'll be back in a moment. - Hi, baby! - Hi, Mom. - Where are you going? - Nowhere. - You're 15 years old. - I'm 16! You can't move out! I don't give you my permission! I don't want to live like you. What do you mean? Without men, without feelings... I don't want to live like that! You don't understand how we feel about each other! Emilia, stay here! You can't go! I'm sorry. After a five-minutes break we continue the interrogation. Is it' true that you were frying to alienate Emilia from her friends? Who said that? Magda Nowak, maybe? She wanted me for herself And she wanted to prove something to Emilia. - Georgie! - Come touch it. I want some wine! - Hi, Magda! - Get your asses to The Rocker's! "My stomach hurts! Monthlies." My stomach kills me. Must be the monthlies. I need to go to the toilet. MACIASZKOWA. BAKE RY. But why do you write a big "2" here, not a small one, like before? Because these are big particles. And those... those were small ones. Understand? And we are big or small particles? - We're small particles. - No! I've read somewhere that Love and Ego are exclusive... When your Ego's too big, there's no place for Love. Or some other bullshit. Listen to this. Fucking great. My band tried to make a cover version... But you can't beat these guys. "All the artists are prostitutes!..." Somehow I like their version better. "Can you see it? Aren't you ashamed?" I have to buy you a bigger mirror. Can I try? How do you do it? Stop it, you two! You're tearing me apart! Turn it down! It's after curfew! - Turn it down! - Maciaszkowa will better get used to it! I'm calling the police! "Can you see it? Aren't you ashamed?" "I hear them say that they do what they want..." And look at this slut, thinking her famous mom makes her untouchable! I can't believe this bitch! "All the Maciaszkowas are prostitutes!..." - Good evening. - Good evening. Long ago, you'd listen with your pals to this song on an old stereo... ...and today, it's breaking the noise curfew like anyone else. Just to impress the girls. And this is why, to prevent further profanations, I offer you this fine. - Good night. - Good night. What are you laughing at? You've fucked up her hair. See? Who asked you for help, anyway? Emilia did. I always dye her hair. Thank you for your visit. It's dry, we won't make it. "BITCH" You're such a chicken! This homie just did something extreme. - What? - He pissed into the pool. Dear Grzegorz! I dream about your return. I count the minutes, blah blah blah... I know you dream about me, too... and the dreams we dream are sweet and always together. Can't believe this crap. Don't worry, he's not going to read it. Dear Maciej! What are our sweet dreams? Dear Emilia! Dreams lead to disappointment. So our sweet dream is to not have any dreams. And here the victim tried to escape, right? Wrong. She didn't try anything. She was in a good mood. We were laughing. We've been here before, doing something nice. Something connected to this case? Of course. Everything's connected. At that point, we were together for 2 years, 3 months and 2 days. Look, Daddy's high on the smoke. He's got junkie's pupils! Where's this turn? There was a turn here. It led to a river. Where is it? Someone stole a turn. Snow White stole it. She wanted to go skinny dipping, but she was ashamed of her small tits... so she didn't want the dwarves to see them. What are you talking about? Each of the dwarves has been with her 500.000 times... you know... What? They fucked her. Look, an alien. Let's ask it about the turn. Excuse me. There used to be a turn to the river here... Tonight it's gone. Do you know what's happened to it? You've missed it. You need to go back. Drive 3 kilometers straight... Damn brats! I'll give you a turn! Want a joint, dude? Fuck! He's got a spear! Stop flashing your tits. I love your ass. Then I took her from behind. She was wet and cold. We're not interested in details of your sexual life. A pity. You could learn a lot. Continue. Show us what happened. Be precise. Maciej! Win me something! Pick one. I want the mouse! She has your eyes. Here goes nothing. This junk's busted! Let me try. Insert a coin. No, wait. It's you who's fucking busted. Fucking machine. Don't give in! I need my mouse! I'm gonna do it Chuck Norris style. I'm gonna do it like Bruce Lee! I've got a better idea. My stomach hurts. I'm bleeding like crazy. So, you've got your period? It's not a food poisoning? Good for us. The fucker's 2 weeks late. I was about to despair. Maciej? Maciej, where did you keep your gun? Stop jerking me, you idiot. I kept the gun behind my belt, in the back. Why? To keep it from pinching my balls. Turn off the camera. Keep playing tough, fucker, and you'll lose your balls. You didn't use the knife again. One has to be cultivated at home as well. I'm going to my mother. Look after the little one yourself. We've just married. Yes? Hello, Magda. Sure. Tuesday, 6 PM. See you. When did you regain her friendship? Their fucking idyll started to fall apart... in October, 2001. They were still together, but the cracks began to show. Hi! What are you doing here? Surprise. - What surprise? - Super news. Another happy father in the firm? A lousy joke Listen: I'm in. I'm a student of the Vocal Department! Thanks to your mother, eh? - Good evening. - Hi, Maciej! Let's drink to her success. Let your career blossom and bring you happiness. En avant! Look, a butterfly. It's beautiful. It must've gotten lost, it's winter! We must let it out, it's afraid. It's going to freeze. - Inachis io. - What? - This is Inachis io. - You're an expert? Get to know some girls instead of butterflies. - How do you call an expert in butterflies? - A Lepidopterist. Wait. Lift me up. It's scared! I'm scared, too. Wait, you've got it! You're taller, have a go. - What does he want? - Some books. The wanker. We've loads of murderers, but this one's a real motherfucker. You know what he did. You don't forgive killing a baby. Come in. Put it in the living room. - Hi, Emilia. - Oh, you're here. - The carrier may leave. - No... You're going to smash it. Am I so fucking smashing, or what? Come on. He's more agile than you. He can do it with feeling. 7 years bad luck. I was June 21st, 2002. Exactly 4 years, 1 month and 1 day. Here's the file. Please Xerox this page. This file's confidential. Are you allowed to copy it? Indeed I am. Maciej? How about another drink? What's that? New meditation techniques? And what techniques did you use on that newsstand guy? You've learn new methods of whoring around? What? So, can you tell me what this is? "March, 2002 - intercourse no 808, position, location..." Suck it. Choose the color. Yellow. That's because you're too eager to impress those pricks. They are important pricks from a major label. - They can do a lot. - You can do a lot. They have to buy this record, because you're the best. - You bet I am. - Show me. No, bring me some Band Aid. Come on. It's OK already. I'm fine. I've got to go. - Please don't drink. - OK. And come home straight after the rehearsal. Okay! - Bye. - Bye, bye. George?! Georgie! MY baby! He was terrified, you moron! He thought he's been abandoned again, you idiot! He was just barking at his drunk mommy. You were supposed to walk him, remember? What time do we go to this important gig tomorrow? Can't you fucking drive straight? I'm going to puke any moment now! Give him a break, look at this road. The sonny's doing fine. You're doing this on purpose. You drive like a fucking retarded blind man. Those examiners who've failed you five times were so right. You've bought it? Pathetic. Chris, you want one as well? 1000 plus 100 for me. Maciej, I need to piss. Pull over. Over there. We can park there, we've got an invalid on board. A blind man, I mean. Open up. Now that's a relief. Call me "sonny" one more time and I'll make you eat your own shit. - Understood? - Yes! It's your turn. Maciej, please. I'm nervous before the gig. - I'll be a good girl. - OK. Let him drive. I've been drinking. Doesn't matter. The best may fall. Nerves, nerves! What's that? Wanted to defile my father's country? It's been 5 years, 5 months and 5 days since we first met. And this... this is a proposal. Plus a ticket to our honeymoon. I'm in a hurry. Alright, let's do it. But in our own way. In Kamchatka. No witnesses. May 15th, 2004. interrogation of Piotr Gaweda, aka The Bangs. What were you doing on the 14th of May, 2004, between 4 and 7 PM. .7 I refuse for answer. I can only say that I hale Emilia for what she's done. We took a liking to each other from the very beginning. I asked her to break up with Maciej, but she didn't want to. And so it went: after Conservatory she would be with him: dinner, TV. You know what I'm talking about. And in the evenings she would go to the rehearsal and be with me. Absolute fuck-up. She lived like that for 2 years. She said she was afraid he was going to hurt me. Emilia lived in two different worlds, but she couldn't take it. She tried to mince matters. She kept going between him and me and nowhere did she find peace. I wrote a song for you! Just listen. Cool, eh? What are you doing with this cog? You've kicked the habit. I've learn to blow rings. Stop showing off. Throw it away. Gimme some gum. I don't have any. You do. And why do you keep banging on these drums? You can't do anything. You forgot? The army killed the artist in you. Interrogation of Maciej Dolny. Tell us about the breakup. I happened on the 12th of June, 2003 at 8:13 PM. Piotr, fucking defend yourself! I don't know why I did it. I even go! a fine. He fumed me in. Not Eric Debussy and Claude Satie, but Eric Satie and Claude Debussy. You keep mixing them up. Is he still standing there? Yes, he is. I told you to turn it off. I can't. He said he'd kill himself if I turn off my phone. So let him fucking kill himself. How come he has your new phone number, anyway? Holy fuck. I knew it. What are you doing? He's gone! He might get hurt! I have to go to him! Let me go! He'll hurl himself! Please, calm down. Emilia, do you hear me? Come on, he'll be alright. Please calm down. I beg you. Then he disappeared for 3 months. And suddenly he showed up with this dog, said it' go! hit' by a car. Emilia wanted to see George, she missed him a lot'. He doesn't deserve the pleasure of looking at you. - Wait for me. I'll be back soon. - OK. Georgie, my dog! I love you. What happened to you? Thanks for leaving the door unlocked. You're welcome. I'm not going to say any more tonight. I'm feeling bad. Please slop the recording. interrogation terminated due to the emotional state of the subject. Was the pregnancy the main reason? Go already. Don't think, go. Okay, I'm going. What would you do in my place? I'd do exactly what you're about to do. Hey, moron. You forgot the cash. So fast? I didn't do it! The asshole kept telling me about complications, bleeding and pain! This I can't forgive myself. I persuaded her to return there. I got this photo two days later... I keep carrying it with me, don't know why. I know that you really want to be a father. Excellent. You could've been. But you won't. Because I've aborted our child. Come and let me show Howl need you Take me as your own it"s only you There's nothing else She wrote it? Her last song. Fucking Big Love. That's not all. Listen to this. What time will you be there? Buy some buns. I've got something important to do. Don't worry if m y phone 's off - What? - You'll know tomorrow. Everybody will know. Everybody will talk about it'. I will be ho! news. Everything's under control. Bye. Don't ask me why I didn't get it. After all her lies... I stopped caring about such stuff. I didn't know she's pregnant. She never told me. She even lied to him. Told him she had an abortion. If she told him the truth... Well, you can wonder. It wouldn't happen. I will never learn How to love jusf so I wan! you foo much to wan! me to have me Sometimes I wish This was not happening The Prince Charming Only a bad dream To torture me at nights My love, let's pretend That love is not a sin I scares me Le! the sleeping truth lie Don '1' fell me anything Emilia was full of joy... and ready for what was going to happen Ready? Yes. Ready. We talked about it before. She knew. And then -- it happened. One last smoke? You don't like it when I smoke. Today I give you my permission. It's a special occasion. If it's the last one, let's smoke it together. Now. Police? I want to report a homicide. I'm not a witness. I'm the perpetrator No pulse. What are you staring at? I bet you've never hugged your own wife like that. The investigation's over. You have it all written down... recorded... Now fuck off to your hypocritical pseudo-lives. I wonder if you're still going to be a smart ass... when you see this. I'm going to give you such a sentence... that once you get out of jail as an old fart... you're not going to get laid ever again. According to the autopsy... Emilia B. was pregnant at the time of her death. The 13th week. DNA of the fetus points to you as the father. You've killed your own daughter. Maciej!
