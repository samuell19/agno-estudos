That's my jacket. Take this. I'm not done with you. Come back. Boy, you must ... strong and courageous. You have to survive. You must survive, you hear? Never give up, Srulik. You have to forget your name. But even if you have to forget everything ... your name, and even your mother and me ... you must never forget that you are a Jew, you understand? Keep secret who you are, but never forget that. Well, Daddy. I promise. SIX MONTHS EARLIER Stand still. What's your name? - Srulik. And you? I'm Awrum. These are my friends. Are you escaped from the ghetto? Did you swap something? Jewelry, one watch? No nothing. - You really something. Let him. He says he has nothing. Never been in a wood? Of course. To play or mushroom picking. But not to live there. Without the forest, the Germans had already caught us. But they are afraid of partisans. - What are those? Men with guns. - But then... Pools? The forest protects us. Do not be afraid. I'm not afraid. Janek, I got the cherries down there. - When she goes inside ... Icek Ljebele and go to the vegetable garden. Josele and I grab the cheese pockets of the fence. I grab a chicken. And I'm going for that cherries. What? I am rapidly. Watch out. It's not a game. Go. I have. Thieves. Damn, dirty Jews. I beat you up. I'll kill you. - Help me. What will they do with him? - With Ljebele? They bring him to the Germans for a reward. Can I have one? - Of course. Want some cherries? Not bad, kid. Not bad? What about me? You should thank me. I'm hunting king. Josele, give me the knife. Got from my grandfather. I'm the only one knife. We must not pick him first? Dummy. There is a better way. What are you doing? - My wound cleaning. Remember: After cleaning, you should disinfect it. I want the chest. I want the other half. - That's not fair. You had the last time. Now I want him. Hurry up. - Take it easy. I'm hungry. What are you thinking of? Your parents? Do not think of the past. That makes it worse. Think rather of what it is to see each other again. That is much finer. Then you fall asleep naturally. Do you have brothers or sisters? Two brothers and two sisters. My older brother JÃ³zef is the best smuggler in the ghetto. He took sometime two roots with it. And your father? He said he would come and get us if it somewhere safe did for us. Has he been gone long? My father is a shoemaker. And yours? Bakker. When I came into the bakery, I got a sandwich. A warm, right out of the oven. What kijk_je doing? Look the other way. Remember, Srulik: Never pull your pants if Poland are watching. Why not? - Because you're circumcised. And the Poles do not? Here's another one. I have one too. On the ground. Run. That way. Awrum. Josele. Icek. Sofia. Gotcha. I just have a few chickens. They shot the pig and the cow. Why? My husband and my sons are with the partisans. You know what his partisans? Men with guns. Poland. Can you stand up? After three days, it's time to move your muscles. You were with me at the door ... almost frozen with the cold. Do you remember? You can stay a while. But stay inside and do not stand at the window. Understood? My name is Magda Janczyk. And you? Herb. Herb Staniak. A beautiful name. Even though it is not your real name, right? I say it to anyone. It's good that you've got a Polish name. To me you Jurek Staniak. Ready. I'll show you where you can hide when the Germans come. You have no brothers or sisters. When the war began, your parents and you fled your village. What was that village? I forgot. You sat in a carriage. With a lot of other people. When clipped a German aircraft over us. It flew low and started shooting at us. I jumped into a ditch, but my parents will not make it. The Lord is with you ... thou art blessed among women ... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary ... Divine Mother ... - Mother of God. Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour ... Mother of God, have mercy on my sons you and my husband. Help them to survive the winter. And make sure nothing happens to them. Amen. And? Hello, I am ... Do not hesitate, it arouses suspicion. Who are you? What do you want? I am Jesus Christ, blessed Jurek Staniak. Did I say something wrong? Blessed ... My husband made them. Merry Christmas, Jurek. They have been my youngest son. They have him now too small. You there. Have you seen a little boy? He came this way. If you stay still, I take you out of the ghetto. If you want to stay, you have to jump now. Our. Halt. Paper. Continue. Mama? Have you seen my child? Halt. Mama. Jurek, you've dreamed of. Shall I leave the candle stand? Try to sleep. Herb Staniak. Jurek, wake up. Tonight I heard voices and saw footprints around the house. It's too dangerous for you here. Remember, if you are a once in great need ... then come here. But you're a good boy. The people help you. This will also help you. It will open many doors for you. Herb. What is it? Blessed be Jesus Christ. I'm Jurek Sta ... We have no food. Go away. Blessed be Jesus Christ. Until eternity. Ik ben herb Staniak. Come on in. My parents were there. They no longer moved. What people took me, but the farmer hit me, so I fled. Now I work here and there. And if somebody beats me, I continue. Poor boy. Dank u. So ... Go eat. Thanks ever. Jurek, stirring constantly. Can we play football? Put it in, then you can go. Are you coming? In the winter? - So what? Why pass you back? - Idiot. Fit. Jew. SPRING 1943 What happened to your leg? Shows. Does it hurt? Come with me. Come on. Come. I hope your father is happy with a dog. Papa. We have to kill him, he is in pain. That is certainly not Jurek. Azor either. Almost finished. - Is not it too tight? I do not think so. Herb. How's your wolf? Better. Nice huh? SUMMER 1943 Who is going to win today? I think Franek. I am more than you. See, I knew he was a Jew. Do not be ridiculous. And stay away from him. I'll let you over to the Gestapo. Good luck, son. You'll need. Style. Okay, you win. Rascal. You now have your own way? Azor. Brave dog. Azor. Azor, come back. A group left. Also, at the top. What are you doing here, son? - Why are you shooting? He did nothing. What was that shot? - Oh, a rabid dog. We go on. You have to go here. The Germans withdrew deeper into the woods. Come with me. Here. Which you could use. I used to just such shoes. I'm very sorry about your dog. Stay strong. Hey, kid. Want to earn some food? Get in. Help hem even. You must be hungry. You will soon have to eat. They give you eat here though. So, boy. You've made it easy by Poland. Now our reward, huh? - All in good time. Let's see. I you do not even see dick. You are as Jewish as some. I am not a Jew. - That will do. Get your reward on the desk, you bunch of vultures. I thought so. They have a child again. Thank you say. Eat but tasty. Jews are also people. I am not a Jew. That hurts. Do not hit. No. Srulik. Srulik. Hello, Srulik. How are you? Mama. Your turn. In? Ingerukt. Name? Herb Staniak. Are you a Jew? Nee. Depending located. Where are your parents? We were on the flight from our village. A plane strafed us. Only I survived. Where do you live? - For farmers for whom I work. If they beat me, I pull to the next village. When you're the last time beaten? Just yet. Take your pants down. And what is that? I had surgery after an infection. What do you say when you do this? In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You're a smart lad. Too bad you're a Jew. And if you were Polish, we had a partisan quickly again. Walk. Partizanen? - Burgers. Jews? - Yes, both. Go ahead. Do you like rabbits? There are a few in that barn. Their cage is behind in that corner. Quiet. Shut up. Make them quiet. Hey, open the door. Open the damn door. Get the dogs. Get him. No matter what. He goes to the river. That young snot does not put us crazy. Gathering. Flocks of two. Eyes open. Hurry up. You look there. Two here. You come with me. He smells the track. See anything? In the water. Let the dog loose. Take the dog out. Brave he is. A burst in the water. We go. Hello. You can sleep here if you want. But remember: Tomorrow I'll go by myself further. I do not want anyone to stop me. Where did you get that chicken? - From a farm near here. Do they need people? Such a large ranch probably. Does the farmer have in common? I do not know. He slept. But the chicken was very nice. The estate is of Polish Germans. The man is in the army, now Mrs. Herman is the boss. She looks nice. - She always laughs on Friday. Then her friend along to spoil her. What gives it her? Come on, I imagine. What is it, Pawel? This is an orphan, ma'am, he is seeking employment. He has helped very well today. Look. Who do we have here? My men so hang on stories. You know that guy? - Of course. That's a ... That is an Jurek. Herb Staniak. I knew it was a smart guy. Strictly speaking, he's mine. But if you want him ... I give him a gift to you. Zenek. Rest your horse. And check out his hooves. Are you hungry? Jurek. Do not. Pawel. The car quickly. We're ready, doctor. I operate no Jews. - What? I operate no Jews. - Impossible, he's Polish. And I've already paid for the operation. I'm risking my job not for a Jewish brat. Get him away. Think it over. You will regret it. I have good relations with the SS. Excellent. Just ask if they catch him coming. I promise... Mother of God ... Srulik. Papa? You have to survive. - I promise. I'm risking my job not for a Jewish brat. We have too few painkillers. Many patients may not be enough ... Why is he here? What is this? This really is a scandal. Sister. Yesterday we could save his hand. Today we have to fight for his life. Sister, scalpel. Mom. Mom. Calm down, Jurek. Go to sleep, baby. Have patience. Everything will be fine. Tomorrow we change the bandage. This is Sister Aldona. She takes care of you. Nee. Look, you love so much. And some lemonade. When was operated on my leg. And now I can do this, you see? You can now dance. - Yes. Ja, first. Very well. A few more. Now I let you go. And now alone. Very well. Do not give up, you have to fight. Natalia, not pretend. Fighting, Jurek. Well done. You won. AUTUMN 1943 Hey. - Look what I can. What's in that bag? - You must hurry. Clothes and food. Mrs. Herman ... - Has sent me. That officer has been replaced. Nobody can protect you. They can be here any moment. Too late. That way. First floor, room 123. Above, and that way. Cigarette? Thanks. Come on. There is nobody. There is nobody? What does that mean? Then go find him. I need a phone. Can you take this guy with the boat? Where exactly? As far as possible in that direction. Good. - Come on. Jurek, I must return. On the estate they come you look for first. Keep your shelter for a while. Tomorrow they go back behind someone else. You're the bravest guy I know. Sit down, son. Since when is your kind of people so generous? Are you sure you're a Jew? Keep it. You may still need him. What do you want? Give that boy. That crippled Jew. I do not know what you mean. No boy here. Shut up. We saw him walk in this village. Give us that man. I still say that there is none? We know all about you, partizan whore. He is nobody here. He is somewhere in this village. And you know where. Steek alles in they got. In they got. Goed zo. Do not. The pigsty, too. "Flames, wicker on." I could not make a sound. What do you have here? Come with me. Fast. Is all this because of me? This is not your fault. They know that we are helping the partisans. That's why they do this. The other villagers ... will be upset if ... I do not know what to say. I'm exhausted. And I can not give anything more. Forgive me, please. You should go. Do not go back into the forest, Jurek. There they wait for you probably. Keep moving. To the east, where the sun rises. To the other side of the Vistula. If you can not go, find a farm ... and go to work for your food. But do not stay too long in one place, understand? The Russians are coming from the east to expel the Germans. Are the Russians been here? - No. Which is good. I was afraid I'd missed them. My parents moved no more. Since then I am alone. A tank drove over my arm. When the plane came back. I stuck my hands in the air and they shot my arm off. Really? Was it really him? - Did Adolf Hitler cut off your arm? What's your name? - Jurek. And you? Alina. Where are you from? - Out of the woods. Do you live in the woods? What happened to your arm? So I draw from farm to farm. Mrs. Herman lived on that farm. We were threshing and ... Papa. Dit is herb. Praised be Jesus Christ. Until eternity. Amen. He lost his arm and looking for work. He wants to help us. Have you ever done blacksmith work? - Never. But if you do, it will succeed me. Go inside. I'll be right there. His parents were there and did not move anymore. A few people took him to a house. Jurek told me everything about himself ... how he lost his arm. Jurek, you should eat something. Thanks. - You're welcome. Alina. Come on. I want to show you something. - What? It is beautiful. It looks crazy from. Let's go swimming. If you can not swim with one arm? Of course. The first one is in the water wins. It's cold. You can never beat me. - Oh no? Look who's back. No thanks. Let us look at the tank. To find out tank? What happens there? - The Poles against the Germans. Why do not you help? Do you want to be? Not too tight? - No, he's right. Just try. Jurek? Beautiful branches. The flowers are gone. Listen, this spring ... some children do their first communion. I think you part of that. God bless you. Corpus Christi. - Amen. SPRING 1945 Franek. Take one. The war is over, it was on the radio. We're going to celebrate. Good afternoon. We drink at the German capitulation. Why would you? The Russians are no better. Come on. Herb. Alina. Alina, waar is Jurek? Do not you hear it? Smart guy. Jurek. I have apples. We talked about him. Good afternoon. I Mosche Frenkiel. I have some paperwork. What's your name? Herb Staniak. Is it true what is written here? That you're a Jew? No, I am not a Jew. - He is Polish. His parents are deceased at the beginning of the war. Your papers. Come down, we can talk. Why did you come here with such allegations? Mosche Frenkiel, the Jewish orphanage in Warsaw. It is our stated. That boy must not live in fear. I am not a Jew. Leave me alone. - Jurek. Quiet, you're doing yourself more pain. These children are the future of our people. You can not leave them to their fate. You know very well that you are a Jew. Do not hide longer. The war is over. It's time you come back to us again. I'm not going anywhere. I want to stay here. Go away. He says he is not Jewish. Leave him alone. So you're Polish. Pull your pants down than once. Go ahead. The lady can look the other way. If I am wrong, you never see me back. Herb. You do not have to do it. I had surgery years ago after an accident. It's true. You can not take me. Go inside. Alina. Hold a moment. Laat me. Let me go, I say. I'm not going. That they may not. Yes. I've seen the papers. Is that so? It's just a child. I'll be back, believe me. I'm not staying there. Calm down, everything will be fine. Maybe he still has family. We can figure out the best. Stand still. Jurek. Stand still. You're not the first person who comes to us with that stuff. I'm not afraid of you. Not really? - It has often been shot at me. I escaped dogs sat in one burning house ... But I'm still alive. I do not lock me up. I run away yet again. You can let me go as well. I can not. We need guys like you. What do you mean "we"? We Jews. Your people. Children of Israel. I do not want to be a Jew. Then I still had my arm. Perhaps you do not believe me, but I understand you. You are on your own come this far and you want to make your own choices. Which is good. There I admired. Really. We want to just show you the way that is right in our view. For you. For us. And for our persecuted people. If you really want to commit that path is your only choice. Common. Jurek? Is everything alright? Blonie, where we lived. - Blonie, right. On the other side of the Kazimierz. Are you from there? There it is. Srulik? You are still alive. Mosche Frenkiel of the Jewish orphanage in Warsaw. Eve Staniak. - Staniak? So I could remember the name. I came here every day. What name? - He calls himself Jurek Staniak. Jurek? That was the name that awful boy that you always bullied. I was always a treat. Take it. Herb Staniak. Then I could do something for you and your family do. However small. May I look around? The Friedmans had five children. Srulik was the youngest. His father was a baker, his mother a seamstress. An older sister and an uncle went to war to Russia. The rest of the family came in the Warsaw ghetto. I've never heard of them. Except... Except what? A friend from another village ... once said to me that she Srulik had seen his father. He had apparently escaped from the ghetto ... and seeking shelter for his family. But you doubt? Because of her description. It did not seem to me Mr. Friedman. Srulik. Walk on. They are coming. Srulik? Papa? The farmer had seen him here. Are you sure? Your mom? And the others? It's cool, huh? - I do not get sick before my leave. How long? - Ten days. Boy, you must ... You must be strong and courageous. You have to survive. You must survive, you hear? Never give up, Srulik. If they send out dogs on you, you hide in the water. Then they lose your track. You have to forget your name. You need a Polish name. Now called you ... Staniak, like the wife of the store. Will you remember that? And your name is ... Jurek? - Yes very good. That's your new name. Dus hoe heet them? - Herb Staniak. I look there. But even if you have to forget everything ... your name, and even your mother and me ... you must never forget that you are a Jew, you understand? Keep secret who you are, but never forget that. Well, Daddy. I promise. I'm going to run. When the soldiers follow me ... Do you run the other way. Ren zo lang als je kan. Do not turn around and keep running. You're going to make it. There he is. Stop, Jew. Srulik? Right goes to Warsaw and the orphanage. Links attend the Kowalski's. Where do you want to go? When I was 14, I was in an orphanage in Lodz. Since I did the primary and secondary school ... in half the time it was previously. I got a scholarship to go to college. When I was 20, I went to live in a dorm. I studied mathematics. In 1962 I immigrated to Israel. There, I met my sister Fajga against whom I had not seen for 30 years. I became acquainted with her family. Sonja was love at first sight. We married ... They had two children: Michal and Zvika. We have six grandchildren:
