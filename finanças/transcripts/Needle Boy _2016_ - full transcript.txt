There's been an accident. Your class... They're all dead. It's so crazy to think, you could have been on that boat. I mean, you would have drowned along with the others. I am so happy you're here. Have you cried? Wait. Can't you stay inside me a while? Can't we just lie here, holding each other? Who told you about the accident? Jacob. It must be really strange for you. Did you completely forget you were meeting early? It really is a miracle. How... How can it be a miracle to save someone evil? Someone evil? Yes. But you're not evil. Yes, I am. Why would you be evil? I think I know that better than you. No. You know a lot, but you don't know anything about this. Nick, I think it's perfectly normal to react like this. Thinking radically about yourself, or... feeling you're luckier than you deserve. That's not what I meant. If you ever knew what I'm thinking - - you would either hate me or leave me. Why are you saying this? Hey... Do you remember a while ago - - when things weren't great between us? I considered leaving you. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. I knew you wouldn't be able to handle it. But you didn't do it. That shows you do possess some compassion, after all. No. I caught myself thinking maybe it'd be easier if... If you died. That's sick, do you know that? I fucking hope normal people don't think like that. - Did you never have thoughts like that? - Of course not! If I did, I would tell you. - Do you always say what you're feeling? - Yes. - I don't know what's with you lately... - I'm just telling you the truth. Maybe it's... Like you said before... Maybe we've just had a rough patch. Everybody goes through those. I don't think so. Last time we had your sister and her kid over - - all I could think of was how it would feel to fuck your sister. I thought maybe it'd be best to fuck her in the ass - - since she'd had a kid. Why are you doing this? You had a rough morning, with the accident and all - - but that doesn't give you the right to be such an asshole. You asked for the truth. Why didn't you answer your phone? I'm so glad you're here. Hey. Our first story is a tragedy which has claimed the lives of 12 people. The police have just revealed that 11 students and their professor - - lost their lives in an accident at sea. A biology class on a field trip capsized while conducting - - Are you playing Chima? - Yes. - The tragedy occured near Aarhus. - Cool. Among those killed are Camilla Larsen and Mathias Alfredson - - as seen on these photos. A memorial will be held tomorrow at Aarhus University - Does the TV have to be on? What? What do you mean? Can't we just enjoy the pleasure of each other's company? Honestly Nick, it's not that strange to be shocked by what's happened. I just thought you could spend time on someone who's still alive for once. What is this all about? I'd just like to spend time with you, instead of watching TV. Why are you making a scene in front of Emma? Can't you see she's upset? - Emma, are you upset? - Why don't you say something, Jens? - Well, Nick... - I'm not the one who's angry and annoyed. Well, we can certainly hear that! I just... Now we're having a good time. What would you do if I died? Well, the young have arrived! So, what do you do? - I kill frogs. - Frogs? Yeah, I study biology at university. I have my own little frog guillotine. Do you know how to break a blonde's nose? No. It's pretty easy. You take out your cock - - underneath a glass table. Well. Maybe you don't go for blondes. Did you know that children - - can't drown during delivery? It's impossible for them to breathe underwater. No, I hadn't thought about that. The umbilical cord is the only way they get oxygen. Until it's cut, of course. They breathe on their own after that. I once had a brother. A twin brother, as a matter of fact. There's a complication during delivery. I don't really know how, but somehow I wrapped my umbilical cord - - around my own throat. So I cut off the oxygen supply to both myself and my brother. I was suffocating. And the doctors just panicked, so they cut the umbilical cord. So I survived. But my brother died behind me. Try to imagine drowning in your own mother's womb. Well! Then how about we do something, seeing as how we're here? Such as? Hey, you're all right! Are you gay? - Fuck you! - Hey, I'm just asking if you're gay. - What? - Do you like men? Fuck, no! - How do you know? - Because men don't turn me on. Have you ever been with a man? - No. - What I mean is, you don't really know - - if you've never been with a man. - Have you ever been with a man? Yes. I have, actually. I went to a bar and met a guy - - and then we fucked. I fucked him rotten. And do you know what? It was absolutely not for me. My point is, you don't know if you haven't tried, do you? You're the one who's fucking weird. Listen, my friend. Don't be so scared of cracking up. You get wiser for every time you pull yourself together. How the fuck do you know? Just because all your wives left you, and your kids don't want to see you - - and your friends slowly die all around you - - do you really think you know more than me? Yeah. Actually, I do. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Well, looks like the cheese hog is on the loose again. You may be the only one in here who doesn't need extra gravy - - and yet you're shopping for a big feast. All right, cool. I'm on my way back from grandma's. Yeah, it was really nice. Good food, money for clothes and stuff. Right? It's completely fucked. With Jesper. If I could just get a hot boyfriend and a hot apartment - - I'd be pretty fucking happy. What? No, nothing. So you managed to drag your bloated ass all the way up here! A little exercise goes a long way. Sorry, who the hell do you think you are? Actually, I read an article on obesity just the other day. It said that eight per cent of all obese people - - suffer from obsessive overeating. It's a disease. But what struck me is that 92 per cent - - of all obese people aren't really sick. They just tell themselves they're sick to keep lapping up gravy. Oh, I just need this vodka. And the cream. I think what pisses me off the most about obese people like you - - don't take any responsibility. Disease, that's an excuse. - Obesity isn't. - That'll be 89. And now you stand there, looking shocked - - but I'm just saying what everyone here is thinking. This is the best day of my life! Camilla? Hey. I can be honest with you now, right? Sure. But I want to go dancing soon, so don't take all night. I always saw you as someone who had it easy. - I mean, you had an easy life. - Sure. Aside from being dead it's been a bed of roses. What is this! Hey Nicky! Pretty rare to see you here, huh? You're in the middle of an essay, right? How's that coming along? Mathias, we're having a conversation. - You postponed it, right? - Right. What's it about? - Life below the surface. - Well, well, well! That sounds a bit... broad? Hey, we're at a party, right? No need to bother you with boring stuff. Oh, just come on! Nicky-boy. Do tell. - Stop it. - What's wrong? Don't you like our discussion? Sorry, are we having a discussion? Actually, I do have a problem. It's how you look at me. The way you keep staring - - without looking away. It confirms my idea that the reason you're so good - - so intense when asking critical questions - - is due to your own complete lack of opinions. Other people air their opinions. They don't steal them. So now it's wrong to love knowledge? If you ask me, I'd rather be a dick than a sucker. Nick, stop it. What? I'm on my period. You're what? Yeah. Your period? You can't be on your period if you're dead. Actually, you can. Fuck you! Hey, are you all right? Hello? - Hey girls, are you coming? - Hey relax, we can't just leave him! - Just bring him! - Where? To the party, of course. - In the woods! - Do you want to come? To the woods? Yeah. Come on, we'll all bike there! Hey! Would you please shut up? I think we all know there's been a terrible accident today. So I think we should have one minute of silence - - out of respect for the class that died. I'll time it. We'll start... ... now. Okay people! Thank you! Hi! Hey. Julia. Nick. Nick. Who are you, then? Nick? I'm... a young man. Falling? What? What do you mean? That's how I first saw you. You were lying in the street, in front of our bikes. Isn't that how you got that scratch? Yeah. Were... Were you one of the girls on the bikes? Well! Perhaps you didn't notice me at all? Erm, sure. It was... You were the one who... Erm... No. Who are... who are you? Or... What do you do? I'm a young woman. Falling. Do you want to come swimming? My dad once told me a story. About a man who lived in the mountains. Alone in a wooden cabin. He walks down to a valley to fill a glass pitcher with water. He brings it back home and freezes it, and after a couple of days - - once the water has turned to ice, there are small patterns in it. And then he decides to go back down and do the same thing again. Only this time - - he talks to it, like a person. Gives it his attention, his love, and... And it's completely different. The frozen water is completely clear - - like ice crystals in a fearless symmetry. How about I get us a couple of drinks? Will you stay here and wait for me? Hi, you've reached Lisa. Leave a message. Lisa! Hey! Come on in. What can I do for you? Is there anything you want? Are you all right? What would you like? I... I'm Mathias' mother. There'll be a memorial in the auditorium in a moment.
