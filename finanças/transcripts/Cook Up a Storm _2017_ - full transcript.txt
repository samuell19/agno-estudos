Good evening. Hello everyone who is in front of the TV. Glad to see you again. Today, "Chef please" will be introducing you the gourmet at Spring Avenue. As the most famous gourmet street in the country, Spring Avenue already has 30 years of history. There are many outstanding restaurants and great chefs, that make veteran gourmand must pay a visit. And today, we bring you visiting the restaurant that has the longest history here, the Seven. I am going to introduce you the person in charge of Seven, Miss Uni. Welcome. Uni not only in charge of Seven. She is also my old classmate. But she is not the protagonist of today. Is the soul person of this restaurant ready? - Ready. - Yes. Uni, could you please briefly explain what kind of dish that is being made? This dish is called "3-cup chicken stewed rice noodles" 3-cup actually means one cup each of soy sauce, sesame oil and rice wine. Soy sauce for soaking in flavor and sesame oil for enhancing aroma. Stir fry the chicken, green onion, ginger and garlic. Put in casserole and then add the rice noodles and basil. Here the basil. - These are... - Corning. - Good. - This is basil? How about the cup of rice wine? That is the most important step. Look, Circle this cup of rice wine to the edge of the casserole, let the wine penetrating into the casserole. And use the towel to seal the edge, so the steam will not leak out. When rice wine meets the heat, it evaporates. The flavors of the wine, chicken, rice noodles and basil merged. The taste is awesome. How long has he been practicing this pose? 3 days. Does it smell good? It does smell great. - Taste it. - Okay. Hey! Just for your shooting. You need to line up if you want to eat. - Thank you, bye-bye. - Next. How long have been waited? It's almost an hour. - What are you doing? Don't push! - Cut in the line?! - Waiter, menu. - Are you cutting in line? Why is that hot here? Didn't they pay the air-conditioning fee? - Turn on the air-conditioner. - Here, the menu. Order. What do you want to eat? Say it. I don't want those dishes on that table, make me something that eatable. Remember, less oil, less salt. I recently care about my health. Hurry UP- "Queuing." What does it mean? Why don't you get in the queue when everyone is queuing up? Only ants queue. Do you know who my boss is? The eight hundred acres back there are ours. That tall building is ours too. I don't give a damn who your boss is, and I don't care how rich you are. There is only one way to eat at Seven, which is same as the others, to queue. What a lame restaurant, My boss already hired a world-class chef to open a restaurant right opposite to yours. How dare you asking me to queue? Just queue... The end of the queue is at the village entrance, take a bus to get there. You... You go to hell. God, we thank you for giving this child a life. Today, in front of you and these witnesses, this faith-hearing child is baptized. Amen. Here the imperial family, please stand up. Here the prince. Please stand up. We are very glad to have Mr. Paul Ahn, our most honorable Michelin 3-star chef from Art Nouveau as our chef today. Could you please tell us more about this fine delicacy? My mother inspired me to make this dish. In Eastern tradition, red eggs symbolize the blessing to newborn babies. Let's wish the little prince a happy and healthy life. Please enjoy. Paul, I just want you to know how very proud we are of you and all that you have done for the company. The royal banquet is one for the books, thank you. I got some great news for you, and I think today, is the best occasion to announce it. The company has decided to formally appoint you as the executive chef of the entire Art Nouveau franchise. Congratulations. I am a mix. My father is Korean and my mother is Chinese. My root, my consanguinity is from the East. There are dozens of Michelin restaurants in France, and being the head chef at Art Nouveau is no longer my ultimate goal. I have decided to leave and to pursue a higher and bigger ambition. I've just got an invitation from China, asking me and Mayo to open our very first restaurant there. - What? - You guys keep going, and we will definitely meet again someday. POng! You want this tile? - Uni, still busy? - Lin. - Your package arrives, here. - Thanks. Hey, Lin. Are the Chinese hairy crabs that sold online fresh? Of course! If you place order tonight, you'll receive it tomorrow morning. - That soon. - Customer always comes first. Then I'll place order. Good, get back to your stuff, I better go. - Thank you. - See you. - Li. - What's up? Doesn't your wife want you to get back home before 10? I don't give a damn to her. Wait, Kong! Li. If you don't come back, lam going to beat the hell out of you. I am coming back... - Don't... - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - We even haven't finished 8 rounds. Really leave? - Let me cover for him then. - Hurry... I have been watching for that long, - you guys are really suck. - Hurry up, I am about to win. Come on Sky, get a dozen more of Budweiser. - My treat. - Your treat? Any good thing happens? Let me tell you something. I had dinner with the chief district officer a few days ago, he told me that there will be a large-scale reform in Spring Avenue. - Really? - Really. Stores that adapt the new development, stay. Those cannot, even they are old stores, leave. He keeps showing off the dinner with the chief district officer. I even dance with the chief district officer. You two are pretty awesome. I am not joking. You see that the surroundings are mostly torn down, Spring Avenue will be the next. We will have to leave after this round. Uni. I go make some night snacks for Granny Zhang, then I will send her home. This fillet congee, eat it when it is still hot when you are back. It doesn't taste good when it gets cold. Okay, I know, Seven. I have told you that I am not Seven. You are not Seven? Are you Sky then? I remember both you and your master. - Okay okay. - You two can't fool me. I am almost there. Let me walk you up. No need. You get back to home as soon as possible, Seven. - Fine, okay, okay. - I am leaving. It's late... - Go, go. - Just go. I am not Seven. Little White, Little Yellow. We have Eight ingredient beef shank and fish skin congee today. Not ready yet. Just a little bit more... A little bit... Don't you ever come to the kitchen again! Why? You have no talent to be a chef! But you have not even tried. It's not necessary. To make fine food, besides using your tongue, you still have to use your eyes, nose and heart. You cannot even cut a green onion. You have no talent. Don't you tell people that you are my son. Eat up the noodles that made by you. Leave nothing. Eat. Are you seriously keeping him? No choice. We don't know the situation over there. There is no choice. I understand. You'll have him back after settling down. Urn. Okay, Daddy is leaving. You stay with Uncle Seven and be good. When will you come back? As soon as possible. I hate you, I hate you. Don't! Go away and don't ever come back! Boss, buying fish? Do you have giant groupers here? I want it. No. How about horse-head? We just caught it this morning. Get two of them? Horse-head is too muddy taste. Can't use them if just caught in this morning. You can... - It doesn't matter. - Morning brother Sheng. - Morning. - Do you have it? Yes of course, look! Look...How big it is. So fresh. This one is at least 8 catty? - You are good, this one is big and fresh. - Just buy it. Boss, didn't you just say you don't have it? This big giant grouper, only he can handle it best in our neighborhood. It is a waste if I sell it to you. I can't buy it because I am not a good cook? Who set this rule? I asked to have it first. It should be first-come first-served. It is a waste if you can't make it best. And I truly don't have this giant grouper everyday. - Please buy it next time. - Here, brother Sheng, I am in a hurry. Okay, here you go. He said that only you can handle this fish best, how would you cook it? Take out only the middle part of the fish, using the fermented bean curd sauce. Chinese prickly ash, star anise, Sichuan pepper, clove and cinnamon, marinate it until it is thoroughly soaked. Then use shallot to wrap up the fillet and flame-cook it until it is crispy and tender. I think you should use fennel, carrot, blood orange, and scallion as the base. Seasoning the fillet with salt and black pepper. Wrap it with baking paper and lastly, add the sage. Pour into the white wine and roast it to enhance the flavor. White meat served with white wine. It utterly keeps the freshness of the fish. Two great chefs, please just leave me alone. You two share it. The middle line of the table cloth has to be aligned. The length of the drop cloth has to be the same. The distance between plates and the edge of the table has to be 1cm. Handsome, can I get some water to wash my hands? Sure, of course. - Come, come wash your hands. - Thank you. Showtime? Yes, we are in a rush, have to leave first. - That soon? Just leave like this. - Bye-bye. Quick. Nice. Move away. Who do you think that they will invite for the ribbon-cutting ceremony? When do you start following famous people? Do you think that they are going to affect our business? The feng shui of that place is bad, it changed 4 or 5 bosses, let's see how long they can support. The boss is coming. Boss,heHo“. Welcome... Welcome... - Welcome... - Chariman. The chairman of delicacy. Welcome... Good day Mr. and Mrs. Chairman. Everyone, welcome to Stellar. Jia-cong, I come here mainly to show my gratitude to the Li's Group, to your outstanding contribution to our town. - Don't be too extravagant, - Yes. Simple dishes are just fine. Simple dishes. The decoration is very sophisticated. Please take a seat. Please take a seat. What would you like to eat madam, just feel free to order. Paul, Mr. and Mrs. Chairman are here. Please come out. This is our 3-starred chef, Paul Ahn. Today, I have prepared Carpaccio for everyone. Tuna is cooked with Manuka honey. I hope you all enjoy. - Good. - Please wait a second. We go to prepare. - The Seven Anniversary Big Promotion. - The Seven Promotion. - All dishes are 5 dollars only! - Come and see. - Everyone, don't miss this bargain. - It's wise to come and taste. Just 5 dollars for all you can eat! Please come! - Just click a "like" if you don't have money... - Stop the brawling. - What? - The Seven anniversary promotion... The Seven anniversary promotion... Do you own this street? What do you guys want? Move away. Excuse me. Nothing. What? Stop it, stop arguing. What's going on? This street is co-owned by all the neighbors in Spring Avenue. Either this road or that tree are ours. If you need to do business, you at least need to earn our respect. Listen up. We have brought the world most first-classed chef to run this restaurant here, as to make this neighborhood with a little bit more class. But you guys, I know, you guys are afraid us winning over your customers and therefore to make a scene here. I am telling you, this society is ruled by law. Okay okay... What? The world most first-classed chef? - Who are you trying to scare? - That's right. We both run restaurants, let's compete with the culinary art. Let's compete, with whom? Definitely not him, with me... You? What's going on? Sky is back... - Sky is back... - Let's compete. - This is our chef. - What's the matter? - Fight against him, win him. - Let's start. - Compete how? - Paul Ahn. Our Michelin 3-star chef who is from France. He is from Seven, - starful... - chef. Very quick. Amazing. Pretty clean. Fabulous, it is spectacular. This, a cosmopolitan restaurant. And this, our local time-honored shop. I heard that both of you two have signed up for the International Chef Challenge Competition. In a way that the result of the competition will straightly affect our Spring Avenue's future development plan. - Either to tear down our old buildings... - What plan? As to create an international commercial zone, or to keep our old buildings, to develop our local culture, it all depends on the result of this competition. Both of you, please take a step to here, in the coming competition, - Can you translate a bit? - The two of you will be competitors. - But today, both of you are - In fact, if - the members of Spring Avenue, - we win the competition, - Seven is still Seven. - we are family. - If we lose, - Come, - Seven will... - take out your hands, and shake. - Applaud. - Good. We wish both of them will get a good result in the competition. Great... It's freshly new. This episode, "Chef please" is introducing the genuine Michelin 3-star chef. He is Paul Ahn. He is from Europe, and he is also the founder and head chef of Stellar. Now we are going to see how he makes such a star-rated cuisine. Here. It is truly very beautiful. What is the name of this dish? This is today's main dish. French Escargots. And this time, Stellar is also shortlisted in the final competition of "Chef please". And which 2 restaurants will be competing in the final? That will be decided by your vote. Chinese food culture is so profound and deep. You came to China and what do you gain? Honestly, nothing. Although Chinese cuisine has a very long history, it is very conservative. There is no transformation. The cooking method of Mapo Tofu 300 years ago is just same as the current method. There is no breakthrough, I am bored. Yet, western cuisine is different. It evolves with the times. It keeps infusing new technology and merge into the food. It keeps innovating and improving. This Michelin. You need to make-up for getting into the kitchen? Don't make me. I think they might just probably don't understand. He looks only know how to do a facial and a manicure. How's the taste? Please enjoy. Thank you. Just served, please try. The Chinese style escargot. Let's try. Try and sees if you like it? It should be more or less same as Stellar How did you do it? My master is the King of Flavor. My sense of taste would not be bad either. And the key point of this dish is the ingredient. The meat of the escargots is so fleshy. And the combination of the sauces determines the taste of the dish. Yet, it is not easy to make exactly the same texture. They should have simmered and roasted it slowly. Yet I stir fried it with high temperature. There is still a little bit difference. Brother Sky! What did you made? Escargots, try it. You haven't eaten it, try. Let me try it. Good stuff. How is it? I prefer stir fried field snails. - Really? - I like field snail more. Sky, give me two more plates of field snail and two beers. Got it. - Thank you. - Right away. What's up? Silly, are you rambling again? I am not rambling. I am just worried. What are you worried about? Although Hai said he liked field snails more. But you see, Customers are really fewer than before. How much of a plate of field snail that we sell? How about them? But do you think can escargot compare with field snail? - No. - That's right. Seven and Stellar, is just same as field snail and escargot. People who like field snail do not necessarily like escargot. People who like escargot also do not necessarily like field snail. Therefore we cannot compare. But, What they understand, I understand too. Seven has opened for so many years, it feels like that it is the canteen of Spring Avenue. What we make is the family dish that neighbors like. If we suddenly change it. Or even change it to Michelin-style, they won't get used to it. We only cook for one goal, which is people can eat our dishes happily. And anything else, just leave it. Brother Sheng. Fish? Sold out. To whom? To the Stellar. They doubled the price. - So I sold to them. - Cool, good for them... I don't feel good, but you know, it's just business. It's alright, just keep some for me next time. Sure, no problem. - See you. - Okay. Bye-bye. - What do you want? - Go away. - Stop making trouble. - Hey! Whose car is it out there? It stops at the crossroads and it blocks us. - It stops at the junction. - Keep it down, calm down. You guys are crossing the line. It doesn't just happen once or twice. - Please listen to me. - The car parked at our area. - How can we do our business? - I am sorry. - Take a look, it just parked right here. - I am sorry. Where can our customers be seated? What now? Can you please calm down and let me explain? Come on. - I am sorry. - Hello. How can I help you? - Your car, how can you park like this? - What's the matter? Their car block this place. We can't place our tables. Your car does block our store's area. Customer will leave when they finish the meal. They will leave after finish? So we just open our store after they finish the meal? It's just too outrageous! - Forget about it... - Just move it or I will crush your car! Who do you think you are? Hurry up, Uni. Chef please is starting. According to the votes of the public, shortlisted restaurants to the final of the "Chef please" is made. It will be Stellar competing with Seven. We would like to tell everyone a good news. Sevenisin! The winner - Seven. - can challenge the two-time champion in a row of the world delicacy, Mr. Mountain K0. Is it true? Culinary competition. Sky... The god of cookery is my idol. I love him the most. You have to take us to Macau to see the god of cookery. The god of cookery... A significant event in the F&B industry, the International culinary competition, will be held at the City of Dreams in Macau. I believe that all of you would like to know the story of the two-times champion in a row of the world delicacy. Today, we are happy to have Mr. Mountain K0 here and have an interview with us. Hello, Mr. K0. Hello. - Hello. - What's your feeling right now? What's my feeling right now? I am okay, already get used to it. So, what is your expectation of the candidates of this competition? I hope the standard of the candidates can be raised a bit more. So, Mr. K0, what do you think the reasons why that few Chinese chefs could have won in international culinary competitions? Because they are not as talented as I am. Mr. K0, we know that you are from Shunde, there is a long-faced talented chef in Shunde and his surname is also K0, his name is Sky K0. Do you know him? Although my surname is K0, there are so many people in the world also named K0. I couldn't have known all the Kos. But a source told us that Sky K0 is actually your son. How dare you... asking a question like this. Mr. Do you want to cancel tonight's booking? Okay, it's alright. Miss Uni. Are you also tried of eating your restaurant's western cuisine? You need to make a booking to eat at Seven. I think you misunderstand. I don't come for an argument today. I just want to give you this invitation. We'd like to invite you two to Stellar tonight, We hope that you will do us the honour. Go? Here. Please be seated. - I'll serve myself. - Okay. Welcome to Stellar. This is tonight's special. Would you like me to explain? (France) We would like the chef's recommendation for tonight, thank you. Okay. Olive oil is for the bread, it is healthier. Please wait. Do you really understand or pretend to understand? I just learnt this sentence in this morning. Wow! It's magnificent. Hello, this is your appetizer, please enjoy. Fried egg, seriously? What is it? How great is it about this fried egg? Are they looking down on us? It... Let's try first. It's not fried egg. What? Mango. Passion fruit. And wine. Iced coconut juice. How did he make it? How are you? This is the chef's recommendation. Please enjoy. What the...? It is raw vegan salad. You two haven't seen it, have you? Relax. All the ingredients are eatable. You wouldn't understand even if I explain to you. I come here to have dinner, not to watch you playing tricks. Get back to France if you just want to show off. Relax. That's okay. Everyone out first. This is Japanese A5 Wagyu. Any opinion? Sous vide at 57 degrees. It's actually not a big deal. But, That big piece of steak, it will get cold before I finish it. It won't be tasty, no matter how expensive the Wagyu is. Just same as your fried egg and salad, the food-plating is pretty, but you just can't keep the temperature. So, how would you handle it? Can it be used? Family dish. Sautéed sliced beef with onion. Do you know why I name this restaurant Stellar? In China, there are not many Michelin 3-star restaurants. It is because they are too conservative. They are unenterprising. I come here as to take the Michelin 3-star. Applewood smoked A5 Wagyu. After a long time of sous vide, the meat becomes so tender. And to match with the right wine, it's perfection. Don't you ever come inside the kitchen again. Why? You have no talent to be a chef. It is because they are too conservative. They are unenterprising. Hello? Master? We made an appointment. Just nearby. Is it really necessary to meet in person? What do you think? He is your biological son. It's because he is my biological son, that's why he is like me. The bad temper, stubborness and annoying. You didn't raise him, and you didn't allow him to go inside the kitchen. Enough“. You have wasted for 20 years. You think he is good? Let's not talk about the culinary skill. Regarding the personality, he is a lot better than you. Your turn. Dodge again, always dodging. Master. Hello. Your father is back. He is not my father. If I do have a father, that would be you. Your puberty is way too long. You said it, you don't know me. I am the two-times champion in a row of the world delicacy. I don't want you to have any pressure. Is it that great to be the god of cookery? Do you feel embarrassed that people talk about Spring Avenue and talk about me? I bet your father doesn't feel this way. This is exactly how I feel. You stay out of it, stay out of it... I heard that there is a talented long-faced chef in Spring Avenue, it was you? Right? You look at him, he just looks exactly like me. Temper is bad, impulsive, such a long face. You just ask anyone out there, and who wouldn't know that I am your father. The only different thing is, I am braver. I am brave enough to go outside. And the most important point is lsucceeded. Why don't you first defeat me to prove that you are capable. Okay? Otherwise, you are just a prat from a small store in Spring Avenue who wouldn't even dare to call his biological father "father". I am going to remember what you have just said and I will prove myself to you. People do not need to be that cruel, that arrogant to be succeeded. And the god of cookery can also come from a small store in Spring Avenue. Sky! Why do you have to be like this. - Hello, this is your package. - Hello. - Thank you, good bye. - Good bye. Paul. The additional order has arrived. It's all good now. You are not going to lose. Ladies and gentlemen, hello everyone, lam your host, MC Chen. Let me hear your applauds and noise okay? Welcome everyone. Hello to all the audiences here and in front of the TV. Welcome watching the final of "Chef please" that is hosted by the Southern Breeze Television and solely sponsored by the AUX Air-conditioning. I am MC Chen. Welcome everyone. Your votes have been examined by our specialists, - It's very nervous. - the two chefs that are standing on the stage tonight surprisingly are from the same district. Firstly, let's put our hands together for the chef of Stellar in Spring Avenue, Paul Ahn. Paul. - Paul. - Yeah. Welcome Paul. He is a Michelin 3-star chef from Europe. And his opponent today, who is also from Spring Avenue, the chef of - the time-honored Seven. - It's Sky. - Sky... - Sky K0. You must win... The two chefs please go back to your working table and get ready for the competition, please. Today, the people who feel the most struggling should be our judges. We have the talented chef on the one side. And the other side, is the 3-star chef. So, how should we choose? Let's welcome our judges today. Welcome our beautiful MC, Yiyi. Well-known food critic, Mr. Benny Li. The master of Chaoshan cuisine, Xinmin Zhang The master of Huaiyang cuisine, Xiaoyan Zhou. Today's result will have to be counted on the four of you. Today's rule, the two chefs have to finish their dishes in 90-minute, and it will be appraised by our four judges. Let me remind the two of you again, the winner today, next month, he will attend the world delicacy that to be held at the Studio City Event Center in Macau. And he also have a chance to challenge the god of cookery. This is an absolute honor in the F&B industry. And I believe the two of us will grasp this chance. Let's put our hands together again for them. - Sky 90 for n! - Cheer up! I now announce, the competition starts. The knife skill is breathtaking. He has the knowledge of Huaiyang cuisine. To make this stuffed duck, it requires a high-level of knife skill. The meat and bone are plainly separated. He has what it takes. What's the name? - Where is he? - Why he left? Got scared? Isn't it against the rule of using that large of pot? Don't worry boss, it's not necessary a good thing to use a large pot. His stability is not bad. He needs to be steady for this motion, otherwise the dish up will be sabotaged. Paul is poised. He must be very experienced in competitions. And take a look of how he cut the foie gras with a hot knife, it's just purely art. The knife after getting heat, it slices even more smooth and neatly. The sliced foie gras is neater and more beautiful. It's just too pretty. That thing, is just same as the food that we had on that day. Cold. Good looking but not tasty. This is the food-plating of western cuisine. We rarely see it in Chinese cuisine. Audiences here and in front of the TV, we have now reached to the last few seconds of the final. Let's count down together. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Time's up. - Sky... - Paul... Let's have the dishes served. And please also have your hands together again for Sky K0 and Paul Ahn coming to the center of the stage. We now have Paul Ahn's dish for the judges to taste. Paul, please do briefly introduce your dish to us. My dish's name is the French foie gras with caramel raspberry mousse. Please enjoy. The foie gras is very fleshy. The sweetness is just as good as it could be. The most special thing is the caramel is not just a decoration. And how he made the mousse is ingenious too. It makes me feel the girly sweetness. Although the foie gras is traditional, he merged it with the flavor of sour and sweet. I think it is very creative and stunning too. This cuisine is truly blending the east and the west. He mainly makes western cuisine. The pineapples down there, carry the flavor of sour and sweet taste of the East. Serving together with the greasy foie gras, the crunchy caramel and the sweet and sour pineapples. All serving together, we felt stunning too. Go for it. Now please serve the dish that made by Sky K0 from Seven. Sky please briefly introduce the dish for us. Yin-yang Beggar's Duck. There is a lotus leaf, It is how you cook the Hangzhou's "Beggar's Chicken". We now have both Jiangnan and Lingnan styles. The outside is salt baked. It is sort of a Cantonese-style. The duck meat is tender. When I eat it, I flashback the scene of his cooking The outside is the whitely salt, the flavor of the salt and ginger. When it is opened, There is the emerald green lotus leaf. This is the freshly sweetness of Jiangnan style. Lastly, there is the Yunnan snow lotus, the briskness that as on a snow mountain, all are blended into the fresh and tender duck meat. That's why he names the dish "Yin-Yang". - Very meaningful. - Totally agree. Good. This name is fierce enough. Boss Seven, congratulations. Sky K0 is a very talented chef. A strict teacher has the outstanding disciple, right? - Right. - Now, it's time for our four judges. It is the most struggling, painful and difficult moment to decide. Firstly, let's see Paul Ahn. The four judges, how are you going to score? Please look at the big screen. The score from the first judge is, 9 The Second. 9 The third. Still 9. The last one. 10, full mark. It's fantastic. The total score of the four judges is 37 This is a very high score. Congratulations Paul Ahn. I believe this score must give Sky K0 a lot of pressure. Now let's see Sky Ko's score. The first judge. 10, the first judge already gave a 10. Unbelievable, the second judge. Still is 10, incredible. The third. Now the score is already 20. Two gave full marks and the third one, 9 The score that now adding up among the 3 judges is - already 29. - Just an illusion, it's alright. The last one is the most important. His score is 8 The total score of the four judges to Sky K0 is 37 - Good... - Great! No problem... - Sky must win. - Go you go! The competitors are really neck and neck. 37 to 37. According to the rules of the competition, if we encounter a neck and neck situation at the final, we will need to have our chairman of the judging panel, Benny Li, to make the final decision. Put your hands together please. Yeah“. Will he vote for Sky or Paul? Please... Actually, we haven't expected to this outcome. Frankly, the two chefs today are tremendously awesome. Especially Seven, - Good... - This young guy - ls really talented. - Wise choice. When I saw him cooking, he did cook like a grand master. But, why did I just give you an 8? It's because cooking, is not just simply having the food ending up in a stomach. Especially for a competition like this, is more care about the color, aroma and taste. Cooking is an art, we need to respect the food and respect the industry, which include our own presence. The food-plating, you really need to treat it as a sacred matter. As for this point, Stellar, they did demonstrate nicely today. After the discussion among us, we unanimously decide the winner of today's competition is Paul Ahn. It starts raining, come inside now. I want to learn cooking. If you don't teach me, I won't go inside. Why do you have to be a chef? Because I can't cook well, that's why he didn't take me with him. You think too much. He looks down on me. He thinks that I embarrass him this is why he left. Uncle Seven. Please teach me cooking, okay? Okay. Master. Sky is not here, let me cook. I used primordial energy to make this dish. Long-lived pan-fried noodles with beef. Try it. What a good kid you are. Seven is counting on you from now on. Master. If you like, I'll make you one more plate. Go make it. Master. How long has Sky left? 2 days already. It's about time. Play a game? Can't win you. But winning or losing a battle is a common occurrence. Right, Sky? You deliberately lose the game to me. I really haven't expected that you could be playing TV games while lecturing me. Let's play something else then. Only you know where to find me. They know too. But I ask them not to. You have been travelling four seas almost a year, what have you seen? I have seen two little monks. I am hungry and I want to have a steamed bun. Is this steamed bun good? Very good, you want one? So? Is it good? Though the wheat is from Hetao. But, the time of fermentation is too long. The time of rubbing the dough is too short. The temperature of the steamer is too high. It has been 5 hours for the steaming until now. This steamed bun is just so-so. Almsgiver is infinitely resourceful. Have a bite of the steamed bun and you can tell the whole story about it. Almsgiver, who are you? A foodie. A foodie? But, I still think my steamed bun is more tasty. There is a thing that you couldn't tell even after eating it. What is it? This steamed bun, I planted the wheat, I fermented the dough, and I put the bun in the steamer by myself too. Therefore, my master thinks this is the most delicious steamed bun that I have ever eaten. Well said. After hearing their conversation, I almost took the two of them back. I thought you would have got a wife back. Why do I need to get a wife? I already got you, Uni and those kids at Seven. But I have ruined the reputation of Seven, and made that person look down on me. Why are you care about him so much? If you cannot get this out of your mind, you would never get out of your father's shadow. Cheers... Paul. I need to discuss something with you. Anything boss. Paul, well, it's about you going to the competition in Macau. We have another thought. Do you have any new ideas? Let's think about it. We want Mayo to represent our restaurant. But Mayo is just my assistant. You still don't understand. What boss means is letting Mayo to attend the competition. A pretty female chef is definitely more eye-catching than you, don't you understand? Mayo now still doesn't attain the level as a head chef. Who say so? One bowl is with salt, the other one is not. Can you tell which one is saltier? But I won the competition. I made no mistakes. Try it. You can fool the others, but can you fool yourself? Let me ask you, a person who loses the sense of taste, is he qualified to be a chef? Trust me, I can. Without this ability, you still can? Why that salty? Salty? Try it. Did you use the salted butter? I wrongly used it. Right. Your recipe is truly amazing, but we think that anyone else can just follow it and will attain to your standard. At first we all thought that we could keep this secret for you and let you attend the competition. But... To be honest with you, Mayo is my girlfriend now and I like her very much too. Mayo. You thought that I am with you is because I love you? To be the god of cookery is my ultimate dream. I don't want to miss this opportunity. You win, but you are sadder than me. Do you know? This is my idol. The goal that I strive for. My father was a chef. The kimchi he made is the best in Seoul, no one can beat him. I remember before my father died, he grabbed my hand and told me to cook with heart. I want you to be the god of cookery, to achieve my dream. I couldn't have expected that I have no chance to challenge my idol again. You said that he is your idol. He is my father. He is your father? Are you kidding me? It's true. Dark history. I think so too. He left me when I was ten. It has been 20 years. He now is the god of cookery, but I won't envy him. Because he is just a selfish bastard. On the contrary, I have to challenge him. I have to prove him that it doesn't have to be a person like him to be successful. But, both of us are losers now. What's the matter with you? I got kicked out by Jia-cong Li. So we are now neck and neck again. But I won't give up. I won't give me either. Bastard. (Korean) What does it mean? Bastard, go to hell. (Korean) Bastard, go to hell. I always think that Chinese cuisine is tough and boring. But after I ate the Sautéed sliced beef with onion that you made, I was shocked. It was good. On that day, when you were removing the fish pin bone, you actually missed one piece. Did I? How come? My eyes got problem too? It's not true. How could you be that serious? - Did I really miss it? - It's not true. - Really? - It's not true. "Housing Acquisition Agreement" The conditions are the most favorable, just sign it. The government wouldn't really dismantle it? Where else can we go for a drink after it got torn down? I won't leave. Even I need to die, I would die here. It's obviously a trap. - We don't fall for it. - Exactly. - It has to be a trap. - Not sign. Sign. He has been very stingy. It is a lot of money. Sky, don't you think so? We can't sign. We can't sign. Tell them the consequences. If you don't sign the agreement, the Li's Group will apply for court warrant of forced demolition order. By then, you will get nothing, not even a dime. I don't like what you have just said. We also know the law. You are alarmist, are you trying to scare me? It's good that you know the law, please persuade them. No need. Please leave. Go. Are they forcing us to fight? Who fought against whom? What if we don't buy the sweet talk, what would you do? - Sky is back... - Sky... - Sky is home finally. - Come out. Is he here too? - Master. - It's good to have Sky back. Why are you here? I come to announce one thing, I will be joining Sky K0, representing Seven to attend the International culinary competition. I am the winner, Therefore the competition eligibility is not belonged to Stellar but me. I have the right to attend this competition. Is there a such rule? Don't be so naive. You know what? Your culinary career is over. If I were you, I will get my ass back to Korea immediately. Have some kimchi. - What's the matter? - I hate people stirring-up problems. - I won't stand for it. - Exactly. Don't watch. Kimchi is almost finished. Yes... Just made it. You deserved it. I've just had my nose job. Hitting people is illegal. A traitor. Go away... - Here... - We don't welcome you We, the Li's Group, sooner or later will tear it down. Tear down. Tear down... - We don't want you here. - Go away... Sky. Is it true about what he said? Do you think thoroughly? I do think thoroughly. I want Sky and I to attend this competition together. I am betrayed. I have to work with Sky as to have a chance to win. Can I, master? You are the enemy's enemy, that makes you our friend. - Good... - Welcome Paul to join us. You can. We are a family now. Chinese cuisine is more about the heat. Let me show you a trick. Open, close. Open, close. Wait. It's just overwhelming. Oregano. Italian black salt. No need to taste. Cantonese-style steamer. There are food on each tier. Chicken feet. Shrimp dumpling. What's the taste? There is something too. Are you kidding me? You try it first. Give me some opinion. What are you looking? Sometimes you need to abandon the distracting thoughts and just focus on one point. You will discover something different. I got tired of it. I haven't had the sweet soup that made by you for a long time. Bean curd sheet ginkgo sweet soup. Why is it so sweet? The ginkgo that I usually eat is bitter. See. If you keep things inside your heart, you will feel bitter. It clears out the internal heat in your body. Master... Yes? - What? - Master, the water is boiling over. Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to the city of Macau, the vibrant gambling city of Asia. We are now live at the Studio City Event Center. Audiences here on-the-scene and in front of the TV, you are now watching The 7th International culinary competition. Let's give our warmest applauds and shouting to welcome our final five candidates. Let me introduce those who are now on stage represent - the best taste on earth. - Mayo. Money is truly omnipotent, otherwise how could she stand on the stage? Today, among the final five, we will choose the strongest one to challenge the two-times champion for the throne of the god of cookery. Let's not wait any longer, our final five candidates are ready. They will have 100 minutes to make their all-out effort. Ladies and Gentleman, are you ready? Are we ready? Let's begin. Competition starts. So who should be helping us to appraise? The judges today are extremely heavyweight. The eminent food columnist, he is also the chairman of our judging panel, Mr. Ian Choi. Having a very high status in Korean F&B industry, also in the drama series "Gourmet", she is the cookery consultant, Ms. So-jung Kim. Welcome the Director of Culinary Operations of Melco Crown Entertainment, Chef Tarn Kwok Fung. Mr. Guillaume Galliot from France, who is the executive chef of the Tasting Room at City of Dreams. Thank you very much for coming. Soy beans. Stone mill. Are they going to make tofu on-site right now? This is not easy. Andrew is cooking pigeon tonight, am I right? That's right, he is frying and color with butter, to keep it crispness outside and tender inside. All the vegetables they choose root vegetables. And cooks separately to keep the original taste of it. Ms Kim, can you tell us what is so special about Mr. Hurosawa sushi? This Japanese candidate, he is very special. He uses ink fish and squid rather than the expensive Toro. I am very much looking forward to taste his dish. Chef Tarn, What are the two Indian chefs are cooking? I think they are cooking five-colored Indian curry. The five colors stand for five ingredients from different places. It already looks very attractive. Very good smell, I am waiting with my empty stomach. Empty stomach? It's all not for you. This is marinated bean curd. These two young chefs are cooperating and what kind of dish do you think they are cooking? Probably is Mapo Tofu. This is a very ordinary dish. How are they going to make it tasty yet innovative at the same time? It's not easy. Mr. Galliot, can you tell us what is Mayo cooking over there? Oyster is very common in western cuisines. But she is actually extracts the water from three different oysters, then use the molecular techique, to create very new taste, which is very unique. Let me remind the five candidates, It's now the last 30 seconds for food-plating. Please make the good use of it. Last 3O seconds count down. Please make good use of its time to plat your dishes. All together, Three. Two. One. Time's up. Time's up, hand off the plates. - Fabulous. - Good. Okay, we now invite our judges to taste the food. Huan Chen, who do you think will have the smile until the end? Good question. But this is definitely a tough question to answer. Take a look of our four judges, they should be having a headache. It's normal, because my head is aching too right now. Who is going to win? Today, all the best chefs in the world are here, we can definitely call it a culinary summit. The fights between the best chefs. I have the result in my hand. Beier, are you nervous? Of course I am nervous. Because the winning team, will be challenging the god of cookery a few days later. Then please announce the result as soon as possible. So, I am going to announce the result. After the deliberation of the judging panel, they finally decide, the winner is... - Paul Ahn... - Sky K0. - Sky... - Paul Ahn... Ladies and Gentleman, the winner of the final five of the World's Supreme Chef Challenge is... Sky K0 and Paul Ahn. Congratulations to Sky K0 and Paul Ahn. Congratulations. Now, Mr. Ian Choi please do tell us the reasons why they win. It's not easy. Stuffing the chili bean paste into tofu, it likes the color of the red marbling. Using the beef paste to make a big round ball and having the juice inside stayed on top of the tofu. And the tinier ginger juice, the green onion balls. It feels like all the tastes are exploding from your mouth. And the most important thing is they don't forget the origin. Everyone knows Sichuan cuisine is not only about spicy, most importantly is the numbness. The Chinese prickly ash that they used, I knew it when I ate it, it is Sichuan pepper. A string of pepper, you only take the very top three pieces. It smells good and piquant. The food that with this ingredient, the combination of the whole dish is really tasty, it is truly delicious. What they did is genuinely a miracle in the industry. A few days later, the competition will be held here. I have waited for so long and finally I am here. It's pretty spectacular. But do we need to consider what we should cook in the next round? The rule is only one person can compete against the god of cookery on the stage. So you think about it. Let me help you. It is you to think about it. I decide to quit. It is you to challenge the god of cookery. After I lost my sense of taste, and I still could stand on the stage in the competition, I felt like I have already won. So you don't have to make concessions to me. I know, defeating that person is very important to you. Thank you. But I have ruined the reputation of Seven, and made that person look down on me. If you don't get rid of this, you will never get out of your father's shadow. Welcome to the Studio City Event Center. We are now in the final stage of the World Supreme Chef Challenge. Welcome everyone. - Please also applaud for our four judges. - Welcome. - Break a leg. - Sky... The long-expected picture has shown up. Sky K0, the talented chef from Spring Avenue, can he successfully defeat the 2-time champion? Please show your strongest enthusiasm to welcome the god of cookery, Mountain K0. The god of cookery... I believe that there is no more dishes on the earth that you two cannot handle. That's why our judges today assigned a very special topic. The dish that you two are going to cook, has to combine your deepest understanding of culinary. No matter the taste, or the styles, it's totally up to you. The only limited thing is you will only have an hour. Please get ready. And now I announce the competition starts. Mr. Ian Choi, may I ask that what dish do you think Mountain K0 will make today? His characteristic is keep innovating. He will not repeat making the dish that he made last year. I am also very looking forward to what he is going to cook. In this case, today's race definitely will showcase the master-level of bringing the color, aroma and taste into full play. Why the challenger, Sky K0, doesn't move? What is he thinking? - What is he doing? - He is stiff during the competition, and doesn't know what to do? What's wrong with you? Are you day-dreaming? Show me what you got. We now enter the last few seconds. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Time's up... Miss Etiquette please kindly bring Mr. Mountain Ko's dish to the judges' table. Not only the dish has the sweet flavor of sugar, but also the taste of cherry and licorice. What a beautiful riverside flower. There is a penetrating coolness of mint after putting in mouth. After tasting it slowly, you can feel there is a delicate scent of lily. It is amazing. Now, Miss Etiquette please bring Sky Ko's... What do you want to do now? To make fine food, besides using your tongue, you still have to use your eyes, nose and heart. Sky. You cannot even cut a green onion. You have no talent. Don't you tell people that you are my son. Well done. The highest status of being a chef is having people tasted the flavors of bliss from the tongue to the heart. Come. Let's have dinner. Let's have dinner. Feel free to eat. Bon Appetit. Here the dish. A good new year... Happy New Year... Good, enjoy. It's amazing. Master, everyone is here. Do you need to say something? Okay. Let me say something. Hello neighbors, Seven has opened till now, it has been already 3O years. 3O years. It's not easy. Thank you for your support, There is a saying, there is nothing on earth harder than having satiety, there is nothing on earth better than Sédhana. We, Seven, is determined to provide affordable meal. Cheers! - Good... - Cheers! Cheers... Rice ball. Go. Qkay...
