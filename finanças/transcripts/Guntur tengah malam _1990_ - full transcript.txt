For the record... The land with certificate title number 35... Which is located at Jalan East Pejaten number 3. Along with the house that stands on it... Is the property of the plaintiff. Order the defendant or a third party who the defendant has chosen... To hand over the disputed house... To the plaintiff in this case. Aunt Emma. We didn't expect it to turn out like this. We have the right to live here. Don't talk to me about rights. I have more rights, then you know! - Since this started we never talked about rights. Since you started this... You need to accept the courts decision on the matter. You need to accept it graciously. What? Graciously? I've never felt so disrespected. In fact I feel cheated. Who cheated? Your father. That's between you and my father. We don't know the facts. What? You don't know? Your sister, Ria... Where do you think the money came from to pay her tuition? Who paid? You only had a small bit of savings and with all the costs... While your father was sick, where do you think the money came from? My money! I paid for it! Why would you give the money without any agreement? The agreement was that this house is mine. And it turns out those documents were faked. So it was me that was fooled. Auntie, understand we didn't cheat you. As your fathers heir you need to take responsibility. Aunt Emma is right. I think... We should sell the house. And give the money to Auntie. - No, Ria... This house did not belong to father, but to our late mother. I won't sell it. Fine, if that's your decision. But, remember... I will claim my rights. By any means. Rud. Hi, come sit. Why do you guys look so depressed? Come on. You already won. We should celebrate. Isn't that right, Ria? Why ask me? Please ask, Rudy. No need to dwell on it anymore. What we need is to party. Well, you happy yet? This is better then staying home. What's better then here? Nothing, right? Let's celebrate your victory. Drink... Rudy. Rudy! Help! Help! Help! Rudy! Help! Han. Hanny. What is it? It's nothing... If you need to proof for yourself... Just go to Rudy's place. Soon, I'll complete... The next step. Just take it easy. All right then, sir. Please, excuse us. - All right. It's settled. - Thank you. - Ok. - Excuse me. We'll go straight there. - Aren't you ashamed at all? I need to see. I have my reasons. Good thing you didn't get hit. Well look... Guess your hands were trying to talk in their sleep. I just want to get my photos. The ones that are still here. Here, ma'am, your son. What's with Ria? - I don't know. Why'd she run out? - I don't know. Ah, it's just your imagination Ria. No way, Harry. I saw it clearly. But, why did you run out? No one else did. It's obvious... You're tired. You got home late from the night club... And went straight to school this morning. You just look really tired. Why not take a shower and freshen up. You scared? I'll go with you. It's okay. I mean in the pool. I'm heading home, Ria. Then I need to go school. Good evening. - Evening. It's only noon, you heading home? - Heading to school. Excuse me. - All right. Help! Help! Help! You okay, Ria? Are you okay? What is it? - There was a ghost... There was a ghost in the pool... It's noon, how can there be a ghost? Really... I'm not joking. Forget it. You look tired. Just rest, okay. Bro... - Yeah. When did Hanny move in? A day or 2 ago. You rest I have some things to do. Around the house. This guy really makes me unsure. Will he be able to solve my problem? Trust me, Emma. You already saw what he can do. But I can't wait any longer, Leo. I can't wait either, honey. Rud. Going on dates... Is the most beautiful of times. But, should we drift away... And forget about our future, Rud? No, Hanny. All of this will end soon... All of this is just the beginning of a more beautiful life together. I feel the same. How about as soon as we can you prove to me what you're saying? I'm sorry, Hanny. I don't want you to think I'm stalling for time. Or feel I'm betraying you. But, father's death... And with all the problems Aunt Emma has put me through. But, I think those problems are over. I'll be planning our wedding day soon. You do realize what you just said, Rud? Yes. It means that I'm ready to be a father. I can't wait to be the father of the cute kids we'll have. Just like you. I want a sweet and lively child. The most important thing is they're healthy. Yes. But remember... We need to make plans. God also decides. Bro... Bro... Rudy! Bro... What is it? Bro... What's the matter? It's nothing. I wonder... Ever since Aunt Emma left, strange things have been happening. We're gonna need help from someone. Someone that can rival their cunning. What do you think? Don't jump to conclusions just yet. It's happened 3 times now. Are you still unsure? Emma could be doing something very clever. Or do you want to wait until someone gets hurt? Okay, let's find out. You think it'll be that easy? We'll make him. So where do we find him? I know where the gigolo is. Aunt Emma is his girlfriend. What's up, Rud? I'm asking you to be honest. - I'm not trying to interfere... But, you know a lot. About what? I just want to know. Has Aunt Emma ever asked someone to hurt us? I don't really know. Tell us the truth. We can force the answer from you. - Wait! Wait. Don't lie, Leo. Truthfully, Rud. I don't know. Wait... She did go and see someone. She just wanted back what's hers. So, Leo did you tell them? No, sir. Anyways... You got to keep this a secret. Really? Really, sir. Fine. It's obvious we need to get to work. I will finish as soon as possible. That's it, ma'am. That's why we came here. Well, I can't promise anything. But, I'll try to help. In fact all of this can be done yourself... That is if you want to get him close, Rudy. Who ma'am? God. Sorry, I don't want to get involved. Eh, Hanny! Hanny! Hanny. Hanny, wait! Hanny. Wait. Try and understand, Hanny. You're the one who is closest to Rudy. I'm begging you one last time for help. Help calm down Rudy. Please, Hanny. I'm really close to Rudy. But, I have no right to interfere in yours and Rudy's problems. Just do it yourself. I've done everything I can already. But Rudy... Please. Please help with, Rudy. If you could try and understand what I'm going through. You'd be acting just like me. Please. Ms. Hanny. - Hey. Why'd Rudy not pick you up? Not much luggage. Is Rudy here? - He's upstairs. Hi. Why didn't you get me to pick you up? Where's your bags? I'll get them later. The sooner you move in the better. Instead of wasting money to keep your place. That's true. But... Huh... You have doubts? We're getting married soon. Don't worry about anything. It's not that. - Then what? Please what is it? This house. This house... Is mine. Yes, I know. But what about Auntie Emma who demands her rights? Also all the strange things happening around here. It will all... End soon, Hanny. When? When there are more victims? I don't think this is what your late mother wanted when she left the inheritance. Understand, Rud. Everything you have is a gift from God. Aunt Emma deserves what is rightfully hers. I don't mean to defend Aunt Emma or hurt you, Rud. I just want us to have a life of peace and happiness. How are you, Har? Can you come over in half an hour? OK Miss Doctor. Your patient needs you. Oh, stop messing around. Anyway, I'm waiting. Ria, what is it? What is it? What is it, Ria? What happened? - Ria, what is it? - Hanny. Take Ria to her room. I'm going to get Broto so we can finish this with Aunt Emma. Yes... Come on, Ria. Har. Go with Ria and Hanny. I have something to do. - Yes, sir. Everything's OK, right? Ria? Ria? Ria? Hi, Har. Hi. Glad you came, Har. Take Ria, out. I want to shower. But, I called and we had plans to all go out together. But, Ria... - It's okay, really. It'll be quieter. Come on, Harry. OK, we'll go first. Be careful, Har. Ria? I'll lock the door, you have a key? Yes. - Bye, miss. What's wrong, Ria? Is it... I'll tell you later. I don't know. Where can we find Emma and Leo? Take it easy, Rud. Why don't we just go to all the places they usually hang out. We'll find them for sure. But, someone might think we're gigolo's too. Damn you. No matter what situation you're always joking. You give me a headache. I'll call the house first. That was fast. - No one answered. Broto... Let's go home. Why? Already? I don't feel good. Ok. Why's it so quiet? Where are they? Ria. Ria. Hanny. Hanny. Hanny. Hanny. Hanny. To! Broto. To! Rud. Rud! - Over here! We're almost there. So no peeking. But, I'm really curious. You know I always wanted to ask you out. Hold her, To. Was that Rudy wonder where they are going? No idea. Good night. Evening - Evening, Doc. I think it's time you went home. Let her get some rest. OK. We'll just go to the waiting room. I don't know know what to do anymore. Patience, Rud. I'm going to go to Bu Rekso's place. Here use my car. No need, I'll take my bike. More practical. Do I need to go tell Ria? No need, I'll go call her. Ok. Bye. - Yeah. Good evening. - Evening. This is Lieutenant Darsono. This is Rudy. We already have a commitment with the hospital. Sorry. I needed to report to Lieutenant Darsono about Hanny. From what we could tell... Hanny was not involved in any normal accident. Can you explain that? That must be Rudy. Come on, hurry. Hide here. Hurry. I don't fit, Ria. Ria. - Oh, come here, please. Here, here. Ria. Ria, what is it? Ria! What's wrong, Ria? Ria. Ria. Hari. - Ria. Hari. Help, Har. Hari. - Hari. - Ria. Ria! Hari... Hari... Hi, miss, excuse me. Where'd it happen? Up there, sir. Sergeant, go look. - Sir! Lieutenant. Sir. Ria. Ria! Come on... You said it'd... - I don't know. Rudy won't stay silent - What do you mean? He'll be looking for help. You think Rudy knows we met up with Brantas? If he does it's your fault since only the two of us knew. I didn't tell Rudy anything. Oh, don't lie! Wasn't it Rudy who beat you up? I've been suspicious of you since then. The fact is I didn't even tell you it was him that beat me up. God... Only excuses. Whatever. Watch out! Be careful you'll crash the car! Watch out! I can't control it! What's wrong with you? Careful! Leo. Leo. Leo, help... Help... It's a pity, Ria. Never mind, Rud. Just learn from it. Sometimes we have to pay dearly. For happiness. Come on, Rud. Where is Aunt Emma's grave? There. You go on, okay? I'll catch up later. I want to pay my respect, Rud. Rudy. Help! Rudy. help... Rudy. help... Rudy...! FANSUBBED BY meatisgood and LIO23
