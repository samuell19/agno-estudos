Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. American 11 climbing just a little 350. American 11 Boston. Mike Lehman how do you hear? Mike Lehman heard you loud and clear. American 11, Boston. This is Boston, I turn American 20 left and I was gonna climb he will not respond to me now. Is that American 11 trying to call? We have a complain. Just stay quite and it will be okay. We're returning to the airport. And who's trying to call me here? American 11 are you trying to call? Nobody move, everything will be okay. If you try to make any move, you are gonna hurt yourself and the airplane. Lets stay quite. Yeah, they're in the back of the airplane. They're not... Oh, the hijackers they're in the cockpit. Oh, no. Is he inbound to JFK? We don't know. You don't know where he is at all? He's being hijacked, the pilot is having a hard time talking so they... I mean, we don't know. We don't know where he's gone. Well, today we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. Just get me somebody who has the authority to get military in the air now. Plain seen Panther 4546 on the battle station. I repeat battle station. There is a report of black smoke in the last position I gave you. From the airplane or from the ground? They're speculating it's from the aircraft. Tuesday, September 11th, 2001. 6:00 am, New York city. The big apple wakes to a beautiful calm sunny day. Birds sing as citizens go about their daily lives unaware of the impending chaos. Boston, first on scene, the Algante brothers arrive at Logan International Airport by taxi and proceed to terminal C. Traveling from Portland Maine, Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Al-Omari arrive at Logan International Airport in Boston. This is your final- - Three more hijackers arrived by rental car and proceed to the terminal. At terminal C, a different part of the airport, Hijacker pilot Marwan Al-Shehhi checks in. Atta receives a call from Marwan Al-Shehhi from a payphone within Logan Airport. Al-Shehhi confirms the coordinated plans of attack are set in motion. Upon check-in and security, some of the hijackers including the ringleader Atta was singled out by the computer assisted passenger pre-screening system. At the time, the system only selected candidates for enhanced baggage scrutiny. Those who had no checked bags remained unimpeded. Prior to the attacks 911, airport policy allowed utility knives of up to four inches on board. Despite setting off alarms and the being searched more thoroughly, hijackers successfully made it through security. Armed with box cutters and knives. Gate C19, within the next five minutes, Al-Shehhi and his terrorist cell boards American airlines Flight 175. Taking their seats in the first and business class areas. Gate B32, Atta boards American airlines, Flight 11 headed for Los Angeles. 7:40 AM, all five men of the Jihadi cell are on board Flight 11 scheduled to depart in the next five minutes. Behind schedule, the plane begins its journey, pushing back from gate B32. Flight 11, a Boeing 767, holding 92 souls on board takes off down the runway. Meanwhile, at gate C19, the fully fueled Flight 175 that's scheduled to depart in one minute is delayed, and doesn't receive clearance to take off for 15 minutes. Good morning, American 11, with effect to 290 Flight 11. American 11 turn 20 degrees right. Pretty right American 11. American 11 now climb a little 350. Boston air traffic control center instructs the pilots to climb to 35,000 feet, but receives no reply. American 11 Boston. A second attempt to contact the pilots fails. Several attempts later, the response remains silent. This is Boston, I turned American 20 left and I was gonna climb, he will not respond to me now. Looks like he's turning right. Yeah I turned them 20 right. Oh, okay. And he's only going to, I think 29. American 11 Boston. Two hijackers rise from row two, each stabbing a Flight attendant in the process. Panic and confusion ensues throughout the aircraft. A painful mist permeates as hijackers begin spraying mace throughout the cabin. To this day, there is no definitive answer to how the hijackers gained access to the cockpits. Whether through threat or force. Terrorists gained control of the aircraft. Flight 175 carrying 65 souls on board, lifts off from the Boston runway. Nearly 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. Via an air phone, one Flight attendant, Betty Ong notifies an American Airlines Reservation Center of the suspected hijacking. The cockpit is not answering, somebody is stabbed in business class. And I think there's mace, that we can't breath. I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked. We just left Boston we're up in the air. We're suppose to go to LA, and the cockpit is not answering their phone. Okay but what sit are you sitting in? What's the number of your seats? Okay, I'm in my jump seat right now. - Okay. - That's 3R. Okay you're the Flight attendant? I'm sorry, did you say you're the Flight attendant? - Hello? - Yes Hello. Yes, what is your name? You're gonna have to speak up, I can't hear you. Sure, what is your name? Okay, my name is Betty Ong. I'm number three on Flight 11. Okay, can you describe the person that you said, somebody is stabbed on business plane? I'm sitting in the back, somebody is coming back from business if you can hold on for one second, they're coming back. Our number one got stabbed I trust her staff. Nobody knows who's stabbed who, and we can't even get up to business class right now 'cause nobody can breathe and we can't get the cockpit, the door won't open, hello? Yeah, I'm taking it down all the information. We're also of course recording this. At this point- - This is in operations, what Flight number are we talked about? Flight 12. Flight 12, okay I'm giving- - No we're on Flight 11 right now. This is Flight 11. It's Flight 11, I'm sorry Betty. Have you guys called anyone else? No, somebody's calling medical and we can't get up... American airlines emergency line, Please state your emergency. Hey, this is Nitty to American airlines calling. I am monitoring a call in which Flight 11, the Flight attendant is advising our reps that the pilot, everyone's been stabbed. Flight 11? Yap, they can't get into the cockpit is what I'm hearing. Along with security okay Betty. You're doing a great job, just to stay calm, okay? It seems like the passengers coach might not be aware of what's going on right now. This same passengers who were first class? Hey Betty, do you know any information as far as the gentlemen who are in the cockpit with the pilot where they from first class? They were sitting in 2A and B. They are in the cockpit with the pilots. Please ask them is there a doctor on board? Is there a doctors on board Betty that's you guys? You don't have any doctors on board okay. The transponder signal for Flight 11 is turned off. Despite their limited knowledge, Boston controllers continue to track the planes movements on primary radar. What's going on on your end Ted? We contacted air traffic control. They are gonna handle it so they confirm the hijacking. So they're moving all the traffic out of this aircraft away. Okay. He turned his transponder off. So we don't have a definitive altitude form. We're just going by... They seem to think that they have on a primary radar. They seem to think that he is the Sunday. Okay. Yeah, okay Lydia? Yes, Dave I'm here. Okay, I have a dispatcher currently taking the current fuel on board, and we're gonna run some profiles. Okay. To see exactly what it's endurance is. Okay. Believe to have been a mistake, Atta the pilot and leader of the attack using American airlines Flight 11 broadcasts a message over the airwaves believed to have only been intended for the cabins. Air traffic control listens in. Is that American 11 trying to call? We have a complain, Just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We're returning to the airport. And who's trying to call me here? American 11 are you trying to call? Nobody move, everything will be okay. If you try to make any move, you're gonna hurt yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet. Yeah, we got them on primary. A38 Yes. You guys heard anything from American? No. Okay we think there might be somebody in the cocktail right now, taking it over. Okay. Yeah, I think we he was just broadcasting over here. Yeah we're already doing it. Okay Word of the news within Flight 11 spread from control center to control center. Unaware of the impending gravity of the situation, the North American aerospace defense command, the military body responsible for their protection of all American airspace remains uninformed of the developing crisis. Flight 38. Yeah, American 11. Now we suspect there's someone in the cockpit that's taken over. We have just put them in direct Watertown Jamestown. Last we knew he was on present head and cleared to play level 290. No one is talking to him. Eric has been called, we broadcasted on guard. We tried to your company. Okay. And 290 is not verified. Okay, thanks. You're welcome, yeah, we've taken the American back because he appears to have turned. Yeah. Yeah I need to inquire this invoked in American 11, and put him on your scope. He is a Northern has been since he talked to Boston high, we assume he's of side level 290 Oh, we're not sure, we think there's someone in the cockpit with him. We broadcasted over guard. We've gone Eric, we have gotten company. Nobody is talking to him. We don't know where he's going. We don't know what altitude he's at. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. Flight 11 changes course drastically making a 100 degree turn southwards tracing the Hudson river towards the big Apple Cleveland New York Boston are you in situation with American 11, American 11. He is a 767 department Boston going to lax. We don't know where the aircraft is going. And is fully going to lax was going westbound. We lost this frequency, then we lost this transponder and now the just went to Robert when he headed to south. Oh my goodness, I'll advise the area. 8:30 AM, neighboring air traffic control centers are alerted to the hijacked plane. And he appears to fact South of westbound. And also there was some mention of some sort of a threat being made. He made? A threat to the cockpit or threatened and the cockpit, then it wasn't front certain. Exactly what was said. I guess they're gonna try to pull the tapes as quick as they can. Okay, we just lost connection. Lost the connection. Yeah. Something wrong with the airplane? Yeah, in other words They're not in the cockpit. Okay, they're in the back of the plane. They're in the back of the airplane. Yeah, they're in the back of the airplane, they're not... Oh the hijackers are in the cockpit. Oh no. Number 1, number 5. Okay they're in the cockpit. Yeah. Hey Craig, Craig. They're saying the hi, they're in the cockpit. Meanwhile, on Flight 175, the pilots oblivious to their own danger reach cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. The final message transmits from the cockpit of Flight 11. Nobody move please, we're going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid move. Word of the hijacking is sent to Otis air national guard base and was subsequently advised to notify the Northeast sector of NORAD. 2F 15 fighter pilots begin suiting up waiting for orders. Pilots in Flight 175 confirmed they can see the hijacked aircraft, 10 miles to its South. Okay, United 175, do you have much at 12 o'clock now in five, 10 miles. We are on New York about this morning airplane Okay, thank you. 30 seconds later, at 29,000 feet, Flight 11 takes a severe nosedive at a descent of 32,000 feet per minute. Where's he landing? Right now we don't have any idea, but he was in Northwest of Albany and now he's down by Sprata. We believe he's in a descent, that's why he's slowing down. Boston controller contacts the Northeast air defense sector and requests military intervention. Hi, Boston center team knew we have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York and we need to go We need someone to scramble domestic scenes or something up there to help us out. Is this real world exercise? No, this is not an exercise manifest. Okay, hey, hold on one second, okay. What, what was that, is that real world? Real We're in the middle of a mess. This Oh yes, we're actually trying to get the 15th. Is he in down to JFK. We don't know. You don't know where he is at. He's being hijacked, the pilot is having a hard time talking. They, I mean, we don't know. We don't know where he's gone. So I'm just giving you a heads up. We're not talking to him. No one talked to him about the last 20 minutes. I'll call you when he gets of your boundary, okay? Okay. 22 minutes on from Betty's initial call for help. Fighter pilots proceed to battle station Plain seen Panther 4546 on the battle station. I repeat battle station New York controlled center calls for more information on Flight 11 from other aircraft. Flight 175 responds raising the events of the initial suspicious radio transmissions sent out by Flight 11. Yeah Yeah, we figured we wait to go everyone. We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure on Boston, with someone said everyone stay I their sit. Okay, I'll pass it along over here. Hey kinks on 93 lines. Go ahead. You know, 175 just came on my frequency and he said that they heard a suspicious a transmission when they were leaving Boston. Oh yeah. Everybody stay in their seat. That's what they heard is this to suspicious trips. The correspondence marks the last moment contact was ever made with the cockpit of Flight 175. 0175 recycle your transponder score code of 1470. Unite 175, New York. United 175 do read New York. Over 2099, do you read New York? Yeah 1499, go ahead. Okay, just wanted to make sure you read New York. United 175 do you read New York? Moments later, unbeknownst to the air traffic controllers who had just had contact, chaos and sued. Hijackers force passengers and crew to the rear of the aircraft. While two enter the cockpit and murder the pilots. Sent. Hello, do you see United 175 anywhere? And do me a favor, you see that target there, The 3321 code at 33, five Kleiman. Don't know who he is, but you got the USDA five 83. If he needed to send it down, you can. Nobody, we have a hijack. We have some problems over here right now. Oh, you do? Yes, that may be real traffic. Nobody knows, I can't get a hold of the United 175 at all right now, and I don't know where he went to. All right, okay, I'll see if I have one. All right, okay. United 175 New York. Everybody copy? Say that again please. Looks like we've lost the primary target about 20 west. Seen tracks of the aircraft over. Boston has lost the track, I don't know hijacked. Yeah New York confirms we've lost the track as well. And we were, yeah report an ELT in the area that's Trent was in. Kennedy tower report, do you here me? Kennedy tower report that there was fire at the World Trade Center. And that's the last area we lost the airplane. World trade center and 60 everything you got at the World Trade Center now. We have another stories on fire it looks like the plane was seen into the building. Flight 11 makes contact with the North face of the North tower at upwards of 460 miles per hour. The plane terrorism hole into the side of the world trade center tower between floors 93 and 99. No souls on board survive. The aircraft reaches the core of the building. Severing the three staircases in the process blocking every route to safety for those at and above the impact point. The impossible stairwells seal off the exit for 1,344 people. 90,000 liters of jet fuel ignites enough to take the jetliner to Los Angeles. The Inferno coupled with all the combustible material from the offices begins to spread. The damaged elevator shafts send the burning jet fuel through the building, as far down as the lobby. Four seconds after impact, the two fighter jets intended to intercept the already crashing jetliner received the order to scramble on aware, they are too late. Within the next hour and 40 minutes. Between 100 and 200 people are driven to jump from the billowing towers. Hi sir, okay what we're doing, we're trying to locate this guy. We can't find Viff where we do. We're gonna hit up every track within a 25 mile radius the point that we put on the scope. 29,000 heading 190, we're just gonna do. We're on the track to find this guy. They can't find him. There's been threats in the cockpit. So we're doing the thing. All right, we'll work with them. Make sure we've work with them now. Flight 175 transponder, which had been turned off completely on Flight 11 changes code twice in a minute. The erratic change is the first piece of evidence that something has gone wrong on Flight 175. It remains unnoticed. News stations cut into advertisements to deliver the shocking developments. Images of the crash, begin to beam around the world. Crush? Team, just a few moments ago. Something I believe there'll be a plane crashed into the South tower of the world trade center. I just saw flames inside. You can see the smoke coming out of the tower. We have no idea what it was. It was a tremendous boom. Just a few moments ago. You can hear around me emergency vehicles. The controller realizes Flight 175 has deviated off its assigned course changing altitude pushing the jet liner on a collision course with other aircraft. Attempts by the controller at new York's FAA center to contact the pilot are unsuccessful. United 175 do you read New York? Wanna cross 10 miles turning into your face- - All the 2433, can you climb a level 330. The traffic looks like it's descended back down to 31 now. Now we can go up. Climb the main chain for a level 330 Delta, 2433. Five minutes 33 of 2433. Unaware that Flight 11 has crashed but still looking for the aircraft. Two airborne military F fifteens close in on New York. So you find it. We're intercepting The news is set that you said something you hit the world trade center or something that reports. No, keep on going with it. Yeah. Talking with ID, and we got a phone call that came down to us saying that they had a possible hijack out of Boston. Okay. And I just flipped around and we always want to put the news. And at 737 hit the world trade center. And I was just curious at the same time that was the aircraft. Had been sent with to New York city. Still continued go, this is what I got. Possible news at 737 just at the world trade center. This is a real world. There are indications that it may have been a Boeing 767 out of Boston and airlines United airlines office learns of the hijacking of Flight 175. Phone calls to loved ones and a call from a Flight attendant exposes the gravity of the situation. Both pilots are dead. One Flight attendant is stabbed, and the plane is under the hijackers control. There are tons of people with their papers for things. I can't see any evidence of what it was that caused the fire Owen, we have a satellite picture right now, that is it. Oblivious to the impending danger, A PA announcement throughout the South tower tells workers to return to their desks. Florida. - Get ready. - Yes. Yes ma'am, get ready to read these words the first way, get ready. President Bush arrives at an elementary school in a visit to promote his educational agenda and prepares to read to the class, "The Pet Goat". Remember what you said that there's an E at the end of the word, get ready. - K. - Yes K, get ready. - N. - Yes N, Get ready. May, yes may, give yourselves a pat on the back. Yeah. Okay, get ready to read the words on this page without making a mistake. Everybody tell me what this part of the word says. Robb. Yes, robb, now tell me what the whole word says, get ready. Robber. Yes, robber. Everybody tell me what this part of the word says? Runn. Yes runn, now tell me what the whole. Flight 175 soars over New Jersey at 28,000 feet. For the next five minutes, the plane is put into a near nosedive, descending more than 24,000 feet. Flight 175 makes its final maneuver, lining up towards lower Manhattan. Aviation authorities in Virginia and New York descend into disarray as the gravity of the situation falls into view. Check with you now but do you know if anyone down there has done any coordination to scramble of Flight 175? No, we have several situations we've got going on here, it exceeding big time and we need to get the military involved with us. Why, what what's going on? Just get me somebody who has the authority to get military in here now. Alright, I'll go tell them. Hey Joe, UC3321 code your cell with the North by about 15, 18, 20 miles, 15,000 descending. I'm looking, hold on. We're tracking them, made a hard left turn, it's descending pretty rapidly and especially what just happened in there. I got somebody somebody keeps cussing but it looks like he's going into one of the small airports down there. Now hold on a second, that's a big boy. This guy is a big boy cause he's leaving some big kind of trail, I'm trying to bring him up here. There he is right there, hold on. I've just got a 9500 names on him. Do you know who he is? We don't know who he is, we just picking him up now. Alright, heads up, man, it looks like another one. Alright. Orders to evacuate both towers is initiated. You look out your window right now, can you see that about 4,000 feet, about five East of the airport right now? Looks like he's... Yeah, I see him. He's descending really quick too, yeah. Well that's 500 feet, now. That's another situation. What kind of plane is that, can you guys tell? I don't know, I read it out in a minute. Less than a minute later, Flight 175 transforms into a ball of flame as it makes contact with the South face of the South tower. Another one just hit the building, wow. Holy smokes. Alright, I guess you guys should be leaving. Traveling at roughly 590 miles per hour, the plane crashes between floors 77 and 85. No souls on board survived the impact. An unknown number believed to be in the hundreds, decease inside the building. Debris from the jetliner including one of the engines, fell as far as six blocks away. Plane coming down, you see? Holy shit! Whoa, man! What the hell is going on? Wow! Oh shit! Wow! Do you see this aircraft? I've got it all. Yo, what the fuck? That's terrorist shit, bruh. This is terrorist. You saw that plane went in through? Oh my God, it's good to be up here. Somebody hijacks a plane and... Firefighters, you should all report to your companies together. If you're a New York City firefighter, drop what you're doing, report to your company. A major disaster's occurring in New York City this morning. I think an airplane just flied into the city. It did, the world trade center hit... Another one, we just saw another one do it. Another one? Yeah. Holy cow, that's two and one just hit.. Yeah, one just hit a moment ago. No shit. Viewers tuning in for updates on the North tower, watch in horror as live pictures of the second crash are broadcast around the globe. What had once seemed plausible as a freak accident, suddenly became an act of aggression. Major news networks begin to speculate if America was in the midst of a terror attack. As you look at the picture from our chopper now arriving at the scene, Jim Freely and Hob Oken said it appeared to back sharply and smash directly perhaps purposefully into... Oh my goodness, Oh God. There's another one. Oh my goodness, there's another one. This seems to be on purpose. Oh my goodness, now it's obvious. Yes, I am Jerry. Let me reconfirm with downstairs because it was the accent or if there's more than one, but I'm going to reconfirm that, then I'll get back to you real quick, okay? I appreciate it. Seconds, after the second plane crashes, NORAD is made aware of the hijacking. There's another aircraft? The second one just hit the trade center. Okay, yeah, we're going to alert the military real quick on this. Tony, we're going to stop everything. We're going to shut this, we're going to shut down Boston down. I suggest you stay in elsewhere. You're gonna do what Jerry? We're shutting the airplanes down, we're not letting anyone go right now. That's a good move. We're waiting to hear from security. Tony, Jerry, it's confirmed that we have planes. Hey, get ready. Must. President Bush is interrupted and makes the decision to continue the class, having learned of the attack on America. At the count of three, everyone should be on page 153, get ready. Go on. Try it again. Get ready for the beginning of that sentence, get ready. Go on. Good job, go on. These are great readers. Yes, they are. Very impressive. Thank you all so very much for showing me your reading skills. I bet they practice too, don't you? Oh yes. Thank you all. You can step out the way we came in. The FAA begins to halt all incoming and outgoing aircraft in the vicinity of New York Center airspace. You're gonna do what? We're shutting the airplanes down, we're not letting anyone go right now. That's a good move. We're pretty rushed up on everything, there is a second plane that just hit the World Trade Center. Stop all the purchases out of the center please. Sure, that's what we're doing. Demand center response. Listen, both of these aircraft departed Boston, both were centered fixed and both heading to LA and I'm looking out on the TSD and I think that all the parties out of Boston should have heightened cost of security, is there any way you can bring up every center in the country and we rang that message so that they can tell the aircraft that are out there flying right now, to increase the cockpit security vigilance on this day? I'll get the message out. Thank you very much. New York continues its immediate lockdown, closing down all bridges and tunnels into Manhattan. Attention at NORAD focuses on two more possible hijackings in progress. American airlines Flight 77 and United airlines Flight 93. American 77, Indy. American 77, Indy. American 77, American Indy. American 77, American Indy radio check how do you read? Still haven't gotten American 77. Last, he was at 35 going to Falmouth, so I don't know where he is out there anywhere yet, so I'm still trying to get ahold of them. We contact the company. All civilian aircraft in the United States are banned from takeoff. FAA orders a national ground stop. 9:28 AM, Flight 93 makes a Mayday call. The cries made by Leroy Homer brought the scope of the attack into view. More targets remained. Florida, unaware of the continuing threat, the president makes his first statement on the attacks. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately will be going back to Washington after my remarks. Today, we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the vice president, to the governor of New York and to conduct a full-scale investigation, to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand. And now if you join me in a moment of silence. May God bless the victims, their families and America. Thank you very much. Flight controllers in Cleveland overhear recordings relayed from Flight 93. Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again slowly. He got United 93. We hear funny noises, we're trying to get him. Did you hear some interference on the intercom, a couple of minutes ago screaming? Yes, I did 797 and we couldn't tell what it was either. Okay. United 93 Cleveland, if you hear the sound read in. American 1060, you heard that also? Roger, we heard that also, thanks. I just wanted to confirm it wasn't some interference. Shortly after the first plane struck the tower, signals emerged that an emergency on Flight 77 was underway. Flight 77 deviates off its assigned course and switches off its transponder. The plane goes dark. Not even the primary radar systems pick up the aircraft. Dissimilar to the other hijackings, no reports of threats or deaths are made. Hijacked over an area of poor radar coverage, attempts to contact the plane are unsuccessful. Who are you trying to get hold of? American 77. Okay. Well we were talking to them and all of a sudden it's just... Okay. We don't really know where it's target is and we can't get ahold of them. You guys tried them and no response? No response. Yeah, we had no radar contact and no communications with them. So if you guys could try them again. We're doing it. Alright, thanks a lot. We're doing it, thank you. The limited contact left some controllers to believe the plane had already crashed. Unnoticed by controllers, Flight 77 changes course, flying undetected toward the nation's capital. What the fuck's going on? Hallo, did you get ahold of American 77 by chance? No server, we have an unconfirmed report that a second airplane hit the World Trade Center. American 11 was a Los Angeles Flight. It was, all right. I can't hear what you're saying. You said American 11? Yes, we were hijacked. And I'm just having an unconfirmed report, a second airplane just flew into the World Trade Center. 77, we were talking to him according to Indianapolis center about 45 minutes ago. And in Indy center, I don't know how he got back to the Trade Center. I have no idea if that happened. Okay, it may not have, we have another call sign. Of course, we don't know for sure any of these call signs right now but if we find that it's your aircraft, we'll certainly give you a call. Okay, so you have two airplanes in the Trade Center? And you don't know who either one of them are for sure? Yeah, that's true. Okay. If I did, I would share it with you. Okay, thanks. - Alright, bye Bill. - Hello command center? - Yes sir. - This is John Thomas, ops manager. I think we need to let everybody know this right away, if they don't already. American 77 was over which is West of Charleston, West Virginia, Flight 3350 to heavy Boeing 752 and disappeared off our radar scope about 1256Z, along with lost frequency. We were treating it as the loss started, to do some procedures that knotify search and rescue and whatnot where when American Airlines told us they'd had some aircraft or an aircraft hijacked, we now believe that aircraft may have been hijacked, although no one has, we have nothing to verify that. But with the World Trade Center, we could have another loose aircraft out there somewhere. Of course we wouldn't necessarily be able to pick up the primary there anyway. - Okay. - But again, remember nothing has been confirmed as far as which aircraft has hit the World Trade Center but the other one we have is information headed towards Washington. Okay, let me tell you this, we've also lost American 77. American 77 there. Excuse me. Where was he supposed to head, sir? Okay, he was going to LA also. From where, sir? I think he was from Boston also. Now let me tell you this story here, in the Indianapolis center was working this guy... What guy? American 77. Okay. At Flight level 350. However they lost radar with him, they lost contact with him, they lost everything and they don't have any idea where he is or what happened. Radar picks up an unidentified target, tracking it eastward at immense speed.

Good evening, today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes, were in their offices, secretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat but they have failed.

These acts shatter steel but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down many enemies before and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.
