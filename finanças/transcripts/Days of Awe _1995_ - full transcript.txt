Time, ritual, the elements of nature are all connected for us. For thousands of years we have followed the Jewish calendar exactly as our ancestors did. The head of our year begins in autumn with the month of Tishrei. Tishrei is a time for ending one yearly cycle and begins another. Tishrei is a time when we cleanse ourselves from the past year and prepare ourselves for the next year with ceremonies and celebrations that go back thousands of years. It is a month when we atone for our sins and express great joy in being given another year of life. Different holidays go on throughout the month. We begin with the holiday of Rosh Hashanah when we hear the sound of the shofar. - When we blow the shofar, there are basically three sounds that we make. One called a , just one simple sound and it's a short, repetition, da, da, da, da, da, and then you go da, da, da, which really indicates three types of crying, groaning because it's a cry to God in heaven to HaShem right before Rosh Hashanah, day of judgment. We're being judged and we're crying to HaShem that he should bless us with a good, sweet year. The three sounds of the shofar are representative to the three types of crying. The sound of the shofar is a simple sound with no words. Obviously not a song with words because it indicates the idea that we're just, like, a person is too broken to really speak and can only cry out. Again, we're crying to God. We're praying that we should be blessed with a sweet year and we can do no more than cry out. We don't have the words to really approach God and ask him for his blessing, but all we can do is just cry, blow the sound of the shofar. - Yeah, woo. On the day of Rosh Hashanah we all go to a waterfront, could be the sea, could be a river, could be a pond. What we do is we cast our sins into the water, repent, and hope for God's forgiveness. There has to be fish in the water and the fish is a symbol for the open eye, an animal which never closes eye, which also symbolizes the eyes of God looking at us all the time. What we're doing by looking at the sea and repenting, we're somewhat relate to God and directly looking into his eye and asking him to forgive. After the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, we spend a week in prayer and repentance as we move toward the holiday of Yom Kippur, the most sacred and holy day in our calendar. In the 24-hour period leading up to Yom Kippur, we perform many acts of atonement and repentance. Right before the holiday of Yom Kippur we perform the ritual of Kappores which literally means atonement. People stay up all night to be able to do this ritual. It's another symbolic ritual. We take a white chicken. Because this chicken is representing us as people, a woman will take a female chicken, a man will take a rooster, and we swing it over our heads as we recite a prayer asking God to remove all our sins from us and put it on the chicken. The chicken is basically replacing us. And when we're done saying this prayer, we take the chicken and then ritually slaughter it and give it to poor people who can eat it over the holidays. The prayer we recite is, this is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This chicken shall go to its death and I shall proceed to a good, long life in peace. (speaking hebrew This is my exchange. This is my substitute. This is my atonement. This chicken shall go to its death and I shall proceed to a good, long life in peace. - Face to the north. That's straight through the window. You know why face to the north? - Because why? - Face to the north is because from the north comes the root of most of man's sins, the desire for money. - This is reminiscent of the time of the temple when people would transgress, certain type of sins they would get whipped. Therefore, in commemoration, before the day of Yom Kippur, when asked for forgiveness for these type of sins we go under the same sort of ritual and we let ourselves be symbolically whipped. The meaning of the words that we said were , he is merciful, , he forgives sin, , and does not destroy, and , and turns away his anger and does not show all his wrath. Basically it's a prayer for God, to God, that he not show his anger. A very interesting concept is the three partners in man. The mother, the father, and God. When you do a sin, you are rebelling against all these three partners, and the age that you are punished by a court of men is 13. So 13 times three is 39. That's symbolic of three partners times 13 which is 39 lashes. At the end of Yom Kippur, we light a candle that will burn for 25 hours. We light one for the departed souls of our parents, grandparents. Another reason why we light a candle, we light what is called a light for the living and the soul of the person is compared to a flame just as the person's soul burns within him constantly and on Yom Kippur it's the day of atonement that we ask for forgiveness and nothing should happen to us in the coming year, years, and symbolically we light a candle representing the soul of the person that should burn for all his life. From this sundown until the next sundown, all mundane activity will stop as we observe the day of Yom Kippur with fasting and prayer. After we have atoned for our sins, we move into a new phase of the month and are ready to celebrate our joy at being given another year of life. Our calendar is a lunar one, based on the waxing and waning of the moon. Each new month begins when the moon is new, at the start of its cycle. The holiday of Succos falls in the middle of the month when the moon is full and is a holiday of joy and abundance. - See, right after Yom Kippur, most people try to begin working on the succo right after Yom Kippur. It's this commandment in the Torah to dwell in the boughs, these little homemade boughs called succos and as a remembrance for when God took us, the Jewish people out of Egypt, we had what were called the , the clouds of glory, these special clouds that protected the Jewish people and it says that these clouds, as we wandered through the desert, kept us cool by day and warm in the evening. And then it's also a time of the harvest. As you know, that's a special time and you're thanking God for all the amazing food and fruits and everything that we get from planet earth. Why do we come out here in these boughs is that to kind of teach us that as we live in these temporary huts for a week, it's sort of teaches one humility because you, the, in the Jewish religion this whole world is referred to as a succo, like dwelling in the succo. It's a temporary one. You know, just sort of a point, not an end in and of itself. - One of the reasons why we do Succos is because it reminds us of the times when the Jewish people were in the desert and they needed protection. Don't forget what it's like in the desert. You have sandstorms, you have sometimes mountains, you have hills, you have snakes, scorpions, you have heat, so what God did was he took care of us. We were his babies, his children. He put clouds all around us from the four corners and on the bottom and on top. The bottom, he leveled out the ground and made sure that we weren't attacked by any other scorpions and snakes. The side we shouldn't have any sandstorms and from the heat. And then he had that floor and the bottom and the top, that's six, and then he had one cloud that during the day was a cloud and in the evening it was a flame of fire to show us directions of how to go. - You can use all different forms for the walls, but just the roofing material has a lot of, well, there's special halakas, Jewish law, that governs exactly what's allowed and what's not allowed. You want to have it that there's more shade than sun in here if the sun is directly overhead. That's called covered. But on the other hand, if it's so covered up that when it rains it doesn't let any rain through it then it's called totally covered, so it's like a permanent roof. That would be not kosher. - The Torah tells us we must take four different kinds and put them together. The first thing is the palm tree. This is called the palm tree. The palm tree has the spine, this is called the spine, the middle piece here. The middle piece here must be complete. The leaf must be complete with not a crack inside it. This is the palm tree. The next branch is called the willow branch. This is the willow. The willow grows on usually on banks or rivers or lakes, but if you find a tree, a willow tree, which doesn't, not near a bank or lakes and you take from there, it's still kosher. The next branch is called the myrtle. The myrtle branch has three leaves out of one stem. Every leaf comes out three out of, three leaves out of one stem. And it smells, has a smell. This esrog is grown in Italy. It's pure, it's beautiful. This esrog. The esrog we keep in our left hand and the, all the other plants we keep in our right. The three plants on the right side and the esrog on the left. The mitzvah is we put it together and we bring it towards our heart. - Each one of these species in and of itself shows idea of unity. The esrog, for instance, grows on a tree all four seasons of the year. It unites all the seasons of the year. The lulav, the branch, this grows together and, in fact, to be kosher the middle stem must be together. In other words, in and of itself it shows the idea of unity while likewise the hadass also the leaves overgrow the other one and the aravah are found by, at the seashore. They're found, they grow in bunches, groups, and the idea here being that to have true unity between all four different elements there has to be unity within the individual. To be able to unite and to be able to coexist with others, we have to come to a total and a complete unification of our own self, our own inner being. This is one of the beautiful mitzvah of Succos and we do it seven days of the holiday. We take all of these four and we unite them, we put them together, we shake them and we shake them to all the four corners of the world to unite all these people to show the truth we are one, we are all together. I asked you about him, then I asked you to come here. Then I told you I was going out four weeks ago and then I asked you for the gown. Not really 'cause, you know, I was up at camp. - This was my third. This is my last one. The bag is finished. The bag is finished. Okay, this is very soft, okay. Go to your now. Succos is a holiday of joy and the best way to express joy is to sing and to dance. Each night of Succos we dance in the streets or in our homes. And by rejoicing, we unite ourselves with God. On Hoshanna Rabba we pray for mercy for the year ahead and our prayers are connected with the prayer for rain, and as we pray we circle the bima seven times. On the bima is is Sefer Torah. Each time we say a special prayer which corresponds to the inner meaning and content of one of the seven days of the week, so it's a sevenfold prayer. Each prayer is really also about rain because when we're praying for plenty and goodness in the year ahead, this is basically connected to rain because rain brings with it livelihood, bounty, and good health, and we can't live without rain. Water is connected with the blessing that we are seeking and we're really asking that his blessings should rain down upon us in the coming year like water. - Okay, at the end of all the hoshianas, this is, today is Hoshanna Rabba so the custom is you take five branches of the willow and you do what you call clap hoshianas. You strike the hoshianas on the ground and we do that five times. Okay. This custom goes back all the way to the early prophets, the days of the Nevi'im. This custom is thousands of years old. One of the prayers we say, we ask HaShem to accept our prayers and to forgive us and to grant us a good, sweet year, long life, a happy life, to bring peace and goodness to the entire world. This is a custom in Hasidic terms of striking the willow to draw down God's blessings to this process called , to sweeten the judgments, to negate the judgments. But it's not enough to just simply to, you know, to do them and then to go on the same way. We have to somehow internalize that, you know, and to improve ourselves, and to each day to work on ourselves to make us better people and in doing that we merit to have a good year and a sweet year and merit to have God's blessings. The last holiday of the month is Simchas Torah where we dance and sing with the sacred scrolls. It is a holiday that is so holy that no work, including photographing and being photographed, may take place. With this holiday, the festivities in the month of Tishrei come to an end and we can now move forward to continue with more rituals and observances throughout the year. These are primeval cycles of life that we are going through Tishrei's the head of the year and just like your head contains all of the life that's in your body and the life flows from your head to all the parts of your body, so too Tishrei contains the main life for the whole of the year ahead. This is just not the end, just the beginning which this carries on through the whole year. It's a cycle, just like we see the moon. It's a big cycle. A cycle that began in ancient days and will continue throughout time.
