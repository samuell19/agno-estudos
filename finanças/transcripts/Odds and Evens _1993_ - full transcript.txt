This bet on you and Daler. - Keep it down. A bon on a bon. - Hand off! - Why are you uptight? - Henri'll be our ref... - I've got money, not him. - He's my eyes. - He's yours, not mine. - Pay up pal. - Calm down, buddy. - It's your move. - All the bets down? - Faiz, how about that trick? - Your half, Daler, that's yours. You are out. - It won't hold you for long. - Another game, guys? - Get move on! - Lay down the bets. You're out. My bet's on you. - Daler, Donal, mine's on you. - I'm not betting. - We did it like this in Baku. - What'd you say? - Is it near Tashkent? - No, it's across the street. - Ibragim, face to face. - I've had enough. - Go on bet! - Donal, you're out of money. We can play another time. - You've got all my money. - Lay down your bet. - Raise me. - Your bet's good? - Yeah. - Keep it down. - Bad throw. - You asked to play. - I'm gonna owe you 50. - Yep. - Ibragim, can you play it out. - Yeah. - Everyone else it out. - My bet's good! - Next time I'll be lucky. - This is my last game. You, Faiz? Daler? You're left. - That won't do. - You must play! - But you're broke. - Hey, my bet's good... - How much? - 100... by word. - Is your bet good? - Isn't that what I said. - I'm out of the game. - Getting out early. Raise me again! I add another 100 to my debt. - Can you quit? You are unlucky. Let someone play your 100. - You, give him a piece! Throw the bones. - Do you take me for a chump? - You always will be a chump. - I pity you, man. Better watch out! - You can't push me around. I've added a 100 to my debt. How about property and valuable... - He'll take whatever he wants. - Throw the damn bones. - Hey, end it... - This is getting out of the hand. - Raise me! - You all heard his bet? - Common, play! - Bones, don't do me wrong. - Yeah! A double bosh. - Lucky bastard! - Is that it? - You're not going anywhere. You're going to stay. - I do anything. - I'm throwing. - He's on edge. Property and valuables... - He's a grown man. Why'd he have to blow up? - Look! - Hey, it's a dead body. - Ibragim, I'll pay you later. - No, pal, you wanted fair play, and you got it. I didn't force you to play. - The watch is running. - Let's leave. - Salom, why are you? - A princess. - Mira, I'm sorry. - What's wrong? - I forgot... Please, don't worry. - I was so busy. - OK, I forgive you. - My daughter's here. - Aren't you happy to see me?

I'll stay longer! - Did something happen at home? - No. - Then why'd you come? - I missed you. - What's that? - You know why I came? - Yeah, why? - Remember your dance lessons. - Don't you feel well? - It'll pass. - Look out! - Where's Daler? - How do I know? Don't know where I was yesterday. - Daler, are you here? Come out. I know you're here. Come home. There's shooting everywhere. - Why are you hollering? - Shut up! You, madam whorehouse. - He'll smash the attic. Get out. Crazy family. - He won't do it. - Who is that? - A psychopath. - Don't look for me here. - What's he up to now? - Let's talk. Do I get in your way? - Son. Let's live peacefully. - Who's stopping you? - I just return home. Finally, living respectably. And you? - Live where you want. But your mom wants us together. - Do you apologize to mom? - Yes. - What about me? - Sorry, son. - OK, but leave me out. - You son-of-a-bitch. - Two armfuls for you. - No, three. - Throw two. - I paid for three.

Take her! - Mira, come home. - No. Aren't you ashamed of your self? Leave! - Did you come to disgrace me? Why do you need that bum? - You insulted me. - You've lied to us all your life. - You bet me in a game. - That's not true! - I don't want to see you. - Then get your things and leave. - They are yours. - There's no one left but the kids. What did we do wrong? - There's no one left but the kids. What did we do wrong? Husbands ran away. They didn't have rifles. We are all relatives. We used to eat together. No one knows what to do anymore. - You're beautiful... - I'm here to talk about the debt. Say, I mean it. - What? - What do you need? Money? I'll give it to you. Just leave her and Donal alone. Put an end to it. - Well, are you gonna talk? - Go to hell! - Uncle, wait a minute. - Do you think I want her? Who do you take me for? I have my own life. Blame Donal. He get's what he deserves. The girl can stay with you. But I'll get back at him. You still don't understand a think. What do the birds have to do with it. I'll kill that son-of-a-bitch. - Is that you wanted to hear? Don't hold grudge. - O! Another refugee! - You are run away? - She's as pretty as a new bride. - Let's bride her hair now. - Let's find her some work. - Are you Mira? We've gotta talk.

Gonna kill her? - Daler's in trouble because of you. He doesn't even know it. Your father too. - What's he doing here? Everyone loves to give me orders. - Get rid of that witch. - May be you want me, too. - Do you like me? - What's this all about? - I want to clear it up with him. This place is crawling with bastards. - Take the controls. - What do you want, master? - Hit the left switch. - Be careful. - What up, boddy? Why are so down? - You've broken all the rules here. She comes here, struts her stuff, and leaves. But you've got to live here. People around here, don't like her. - You are a real big mouth. - Slow it down. - You're looking thin, boy. There's a war on. And you're thinking about love. - Don't touch anything else. Wait here. - Was that from her? - No that' from me. - A-a-h... Then, take that and that. - How... What a pal you are. - What next? - I don't care what people say. Mira's mine. - You hardly know her. - That doesn't matter. - Damn, I've had it. - Where are you going? - I'll wash this for you. - Where are you headed? - I just can't live like this. - What's wrong? - It's not fair, my father is alone and I'm here. - Nothing going to happen with him. - I've got to go home. - What about me?

Please. - Bobo, enough. - Gotta live, gotta work. - I've had it. - Get up! Let's go for a ride. - Mira, I'm not throwing you out. Do it for your father. - I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to live here. - Enough. - I'll find a place to live. - Hi, Henry. - Hello. - The same throw, again! - What are you blind? Look! - Place your bets. Where are the bets?

I can style it for you. - I'm famous hair stylist. - I like it this way. - How long have you know Daler? - Three days. - This is Donal daughter. - I heard something happened to you. - Nothing serious. Just a joke. - Are you here for long? - Don't know. We'll see. May be a long time. Look, there's water over there. - How many times have I ask them to fix the roof. - Sorry, I took your cream. - That's OK, use it. - Sleep in your clothes? I'll give you my nightgown. - Don't bother. - Take it! - Don't be shy. Put it on. - Are you older than Daler? - You know... Daler is not serious enough. He only looks grown up. He's just like his father. I've had it with all of them. - But they're kind. - So I'm bad and they're good. - That's not what I meant. - It's stuffy in here. - Don't get out of hand. - I want to go for a walk. - That's dangerous. - Not for me. - Hide. - Everyone's having a ball. - Daddy, come in. - What I said to you was nonsense. It's money. You know how much and whom. - What's this all about? - I don't know what you've decide. - You both leave this place. - What's left for you do here? - Where'll I go?
