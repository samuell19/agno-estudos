Better close the door. They will try to accuse me again. There are rumors I'm exploiting my worker. You mean Ignas? Yes, him. You better fire him, father. Why should I? Who'll do the work? I will. He'll only cause you trouble. Come on, please! There's a lot of work. Managing a whole farm is not an easy task. To hell with them! It's not the first time they try to rob me. Once you own something, they show up straight away. They'd take a beggar's bowl. I won't let them! Agne, come here. I'm working. It's fine. Come. Want some berry juice? We might go to town tomorrow. What for? To tell the authorities about our worker. To tell them what? I offered him some land last year. You did? If I say I did it, it means I did. You were there and you heard him refuse. I wasn't. If I say you were there, it means you were. You offered him some land... How much, if they ask? Two hectares... Maybe even three. I will think about it. And why did he refuse? Tell them he is too lazy, maybe. He can't even cope with the land he already has. My God. Oh my God... My little boy... How can I live without you? I want to die with you. My little boy... What do you want, Unte? I heard someone crying, so I came in. There's no need to listen to our cries. The cow has not been milked. How can I help? There's nothing you can do. Don't look. You'll have nightmares. Who killed him? There were three of them. I know one of them. He threatened to tear out my tongue if I talk about it. My husband tried to escape, but then he got hit and stabbed. It's all over now. So you have feelings for my father? Do you care? I don't know... So, mind your own business. Do you really think it doesn't concern me? Am I interfering? You're not. I don't even know... how to deal with this. I'm going against God's will... but I can't help myself. Where is he? If you're talking about father, he went to the barn. You're here too. When did you get back? You didn't come to visit me. I heard you were sick, I didn't want to bother you. I've been sick for a while now. I don't need you visiting me. Just saying. Bring me some food. You can eat here. If the old boor is not around, a young boor can bring me food. Enemies' food, madam, doesn't do any good. What a clever statement. So, "madam" or "mother"? Or perhaps I'm an enemy? You don't like being called "mother". Devil's old wife! The food is cold. Agne could have brought it to you earlier. I don't want your little sluts running around here. She is no slut, madam. She works around the house and does not just sit around. Unlike you. Always the same old song... Am I some kind of a maid to you? You took everything that belonged to my father and now you want me to break my back for you. You want me dead. Let's not argue today. I'd rather bring you some berry juice. My life could have been different in my father's house... instead of a place like this. We had horses, a proper carriage. Mother was preparing my dowry... chest after chest. And flowers... they were blooming everywhere. Madam. What? Listen, Elena... your mansion is gone. All that was left was a ruin and they took away even that. They are the new lords now. I have nothing to do with that. You know... I am not blaming you. Once a servant... always a servant. You know, Elena... I haven't served anyone in a long time. And no one will make me do that ever again. I'd rather bring you the berry juice. Please, go ahead. Oh, my Jesus. Forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Your Mercy. I'll take it. Pass some more bread. Hello. How are you? - Hello, Unte. - Hello. Please eat. We have more borscht. As I was saying there's no need to worry. If the US and Great Britain form a union against the Soviets, our country will be free in six months, a year at most. - Yeah, right! Pass the bread, will you? The Soviets are taking over Berlin. No one's going to resist them. All you hear on the radio is: "war on communism, war..." Nonsense. No one cares about us over there. Do they have any idea what is happening here? They let the Soviets in and now what? What can you do to them? Remember Churchill's speech? -At Fulton? -Yes. Churchill was the first to say that they shouldn't enter Europe or they'll never leave. Stalin is worried now. Worried? Stalin was only worried when the Germans attacked him unexpectedly. He may have shat his pants when they were near Moscow. Now he's just pretending. To frighten his people. He keeps talking about imperialism abroad, and starvation, and plague, and destruction. Yet, as it has been for centuries, illegitimate authority never lasts long. Well said. Let's drink to that. Deacon, I... wanted to ask. I saw Kasheta was stabbed. Kasheta betrayed a man and was punished for that. The exterminators do the same. They torture and kill the traitors. War is war. And that's part of it. We have laws. You can't do whatever you want. If you joined us in the forest, you'd understand. I don't know, I'm already doing something. Leave the kid alone. He's not into politics. Oh, you're here. Hello. Hello, Pliauga. Why didn't you come in? I didn't want to. You could've eaten something. I will. Here, put it here. All right then... I'm going back. Take care. And Kasheta... I still don't understand what he did. He told on his neighbor. His neighbor was Petrulis? Yes, Petrulis. But he sold the house and left. Yeah, right... His wife and two daughters, they left for sure... in a cattle wagon to Siberia. His son fled to the forest. And Petrulis didn't go far away, no... He's now six feet under. And he didn't sell the house. Kasheta liked that house very much. He was very interested in it. But... The government no longer gives away free houses. Why didn't I know anything about this? Why do you think you should know everything? You don't need to know this. What you don't know can't hurt you. I keep asking myself... why is my stepmother like that? I keep calling her "mother" as you asked, but she never called me "son" You see, kid... It's my fault. I coveted wealth. Your stepmother... she was the daughter of a landlord. With her parents... she was traveling abroad from a young age. I worked as a carriage driver for them. And later as a butler. Her father was wasting his wealth quickly, living high on the hog. And I wanted that wealth, you know. So... he made me a butler... and I started... showing attention to his daughter. Eventually we got married. She got pregnant. But we didn't love each other. She took me for a servant. Once we were going to the church. All the way she was telling me not to go to the churchyard with her. She said she wanted to spend time with God alone. I knew she was simply embarrassed. I was not good enough for her. I got mad, whipped the horse and it jumped. It carried us through the bushes and shrubs, straight to the ditch, together with the carriage. The horse broke its leg. My wife fell under the wheels, straight on her stomach. She nearly died. The baby was gone. After this, she wouldn't let me near her again. She hated me as if I was some cursed beast. Red guelder rose Dear red guelder rose Why have you fallen down? Why have you fallen down? To the side of the wretched? I am a young man Walking the road singing Walking the road singing Searching for my fate and fortune My fate has responded to me My fate has responded to me From the other side Come, dear fate, to this side Come, dear fate, to this side I've been waiting for you for so long I've been waiting for you for so long I've been waiting for you for so long Can't get out of my misery It's time for me to go. Get up, I'm leaving. Go. Ignas... Hold her. You're restless today. Give me the reins. -OK. Ignas! Hold the horse. Well, Pliauga, are you going somewhere? We came to see you. Come on, then. Well, comrade, light the stove. Ignas! Pliauga, I have an idea. We'll invite people here. But... my wife and I... we were about to go to the church. You'll be fine without it. Blame the weather. We were heading to another place. We will work here now. Where are you going? Are you cold? - Did you check if it's warm? - No, I didn't. It's hot. I guess it will dry. Good. Go check the other homesteads. Go! Is it too difficult? Let's go. Here, it is very wet. What is all this? Are you out of your mind? Get out of here! Get out of here, you sluts! Get out of here, you tramps! Don't be scared. Go on. Welcome. Well, comrades... Fascists destroyed our towns in the war. And the Soviet Union needs money. In exchange, we will give you loan papers. Are you asking us to lend you money? We are. It's an order. In the name of the country, so to say. I can't. I haven't been paid since last winter. Where do I get the money? And yet you must, comrade. Zhelvys is my name. You must, comrade Zhelvys. The entire country must. Once I've paid back my loans, I will. All right then. We will settle later. Now sign the paper. Sign here. And you? Do you have money? I don't. I'm poor. How do you survive? I have nothing to eat. All right, sign it. What about you, woman? I don't have a penny. Go home and check. I'm sure you have something... put aside for a rainy day. And you? I don't earn anything. You don't? Will you sign the loan paper? I won't. Get out. Who suggested stopping in this place? Nothing to collect here. You said we should stop in this village. Why didn't you say anything? I did. You wouldn't listen. We must stick to the plan. We have to do something. It's all right, Pliauga will pay. Why did you come here? They were looking for you. Many were looking for something here. Germans were searching, let them search too. Everyone left. Should we go out? I don't think so. They might come back. Don't you know their tricks? They could be hiding in the bushes, waiting. Maybe it's Ignas? Did anyone see you? No. Don't forget you're the only one who knows about this place. Go now. I'd better stay here. I'll come out after the sun sets. You are my good girl. - Hello, Unte. - Hello, Ignas. What's new? They're saying people will be given land. Who's "they?? People in town. There'll be no rich, no poor. They say the new government will do this. Give away the land... Who will they take that land from? From those who have too much. They'll give to those who have nothing. Everyone will be fine, everyone will be happy. Do you believe what they are saying? Why not? You have to believe in something. How about God? They say God doesn't exist. How's that porridge? Cooking. Hello, Unte. Go ahead. I saw the soldiers arriving in town. How many? I saw one truck and several of them on horses. Only one truck? Yes. Truman's speaking, write it down. I have nothing to write with. Until the free nations of Europe have regained their strength and so long as communism threatens the very existence of democracy, the United States must remain strong. I recommend the temporary enactment of selective-service legislation. The recommendations I have made represent the most urgent steps toward securing the peace and preventing war. - Do you have it? - Yes. Who was it? The American president, Truman. What will we do with this text? Distribute it. Come here. You put this on the top. The ink goes here. You put in the paper... and turn. It's simple. Can I stay here with you? Do you want to stay? Yes. Something to tell me? My heart is heavy. Never mind. Do you miss your brother? He's dead. He's not here anymore. You know that. Why are you even asking? Forgive me. You stormed in. I need to check your wound. It's almost healed. Don't bother. Show me. There's no smell, but I'll give you this. Keep it for someone else. Then let me clean it. You know, I wish I could be free again. Like a bird. I wish I could fly anywhere my heart desires... but I can't. I took an oath. I am responsible for my men. I can't back out. Maybe you could... You think I could? You think I don't care about anyone here? Did something happen? It would be best if you stopped going there. To the forest. Why? I'm worried. I'm doing nothing wrong. You don't have to do nothing wrong to be punished these days. You know that. I'm scared. Do you care what will happen to me? For God's sake, my child, what are you talking about? I keep thinking, I didn't ask you everything I wanted. Ask then. What happened to my parents? I have already told you. I am your father. That's the way my heart feels. You are my father, you raised me, but I was told I'm an orphan. People called me a bastard too. I didn't want to listen to it. I didn't want to tell you either, but I kept thinking about it. A bastard... Unbelievable. Your parents used to work on my farm. They weren't very hard-working. They lost their home during the war. They were very poor, living under someone else's roof. So I took you in when you were little. The Russians shot your father. He went to the forest to hunt rabbits. They saw him with a gun and shot him. No questions asked. And your mother... She was... good-looking. She had a pretty face. She started hanging around with men. Started acting crazy. She was drinking a lot. Everyone in the village called her a slut. And then she disappeared. She must have drowned. There are no graves. Forgive me, child. I cannot lie to you. I didn't want to tell you, but lying is... They say there is a holy lie. I don't believe it. Only truth is holy. Yet it is hard to find. Everyone has his own truth, but I believe there's only one. Yet it is hard to find. People lie a lot and believe in those lies. Repeat the lie three times and it becomes sacred. Don't lie, Unte... to yourself or to others. When it gets hard, suffer. Suffer, but don't take refuge in lying. Don't be like me. Don't look at others. You have your own head and your own heart. Start from there. Let's begin. Give up your weapons! Stay still, you bastard! Hold it, Boar. You, Dollar. Some trusted people saw you entering the NKVD building in town. Why did you go there? Who saw me? Why did you go there? Answer me. Is this a trial already? It is. The cobbler saw you and told me everything. I didn't say a word. They told my mother I had to come, so I went. Continue. They asked me where the partisans are located. How come? So they know you're one of us? They don't, I swear. They asked me why I am never in the village. I told them I was at my uncle's, helping him rebuild the barn. You're lying to us. Look into my eyes when I speak. You are lying. What did they offer you to give us away? I am not lying. Yes, they did offer me something. That they'd leave my mother in peace and wouldn't take away her land and her cattle. She's alone there with her sister. You know that. I simply agreed just to cover myself. I wanted to trick them. I haven't said a word. I swear by all the saints. You know, Dollar... We would believe you if... What if? If you had come and told us immediately. If you hadn't gone there by yourself. If they had taken you by force. But you went there, after all. I did, because my mother asked me to. Your mother asked you to... Maybe. But why didn't you tell us anything? I was afraid. Afraid of what, you bastard? I'm not a bastard. I didn't betray anyone. I thought you wouldn't believe me... so I said nothing. You're talking because we caught you in a lie. Do you think we will believe you? I was afraid. I thought nobody would find out. I'd never betray you anyway. Listen to yourself. You're a coward and a traitor. You were ready to sell your country for a piece of land and go back there after we're all slaughtered. That was your plan. It goes without saying. You were afraid. You lied to us and broke the oath. We take it as a betrayal, you bastard. Go. Turn around. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name... As we forgive those who trespass against us. And you? You have nothing to say? Boar, you killed an innocent person. Why? I killed my wife by accident. She slept with another man. I had forgiven her once already. She made a promise. I believed her. And one day, I found them both in my bed. I shot because I was jealous. It was an accident. I wanted to shoot him, not her. But I missed. You had forgiven her once already? I couldn't tell you. I was angry and ashamed. And now that you killed them, you're not angry anymore? Am I right? You're a coward. You're not a good soldier, but you're good at repairing weapons. Lift the punishment! You're not the only one to decide. Silence! I'll take responsibility for it. I owe you... I owe you my life. Where is your gun? I don't carry it with me. Why? What for? This is my gun. Give it to me. We can't stay here anymore. If not for your father, we wouldn't even be here. Exterminators have been destroying the bunkers. Only few of us survived. If only we could have... some scrambled eggs with bacon. We could go to my place. Don't let him get away! You monsters... Stay down! Stay down! Jurgis! Woman, go away! Stay down! Take him. You monsters! Look. What is my horse doing here? Lift your leg. Lift your leg... Take it off. Hey, old man! Row to the shore! Faster! What did you see? When, sir? The day you saw a partisan go to NKVD. I saw you, sir. What was I doing? Leaving the headquarters. Two of you, one after another. -Are you sure? - I'm sure, sir. Why are you so curious, old man? I'm not curious. I sit all day repairing shoes, so I see many things. I don't care if it's a partisan or an exterminator. I keep it to myself. What are you doing here? Following me? I would have, if I was suspicious. Are you accusing me? Or are you joking? It's not a joke. And now... it is. And when the spring comes A pied cuckoo Will sing its song You should know, dear mother That I lie dead In the rustling forests of Lithuania Well, Pliauga. Jurgis Pliauga. Tell me everything. I don't have anything to say. You do. You were working with the outlaws in the forest. Where are they? How many of them and so on? First names, last names. Tell me everything. Confess to me right now like you would to a priest. But comrade, mister... or friend... So sir, mister... you are no priest... but a piece of shit left by the invader on the path. You're asking for it, little man. Father? Father? Father... Come here, Agne. The sheep have escaped, look. Agne, drive them out of there, out. Agne, do you hear me? Let Unte sleep. Let him rest.
