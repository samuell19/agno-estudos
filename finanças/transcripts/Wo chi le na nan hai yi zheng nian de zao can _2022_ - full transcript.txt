I don't remember when I realized one thing. But in this world, when you say it out loud, your wish won't come true. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." Wow! Yes! Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Make your wishes. My first wish is to be healthy and safe. Bye. Remember to submit homework tomorrow, Xiang Wei-xin. Got it. See you. See you. Ah! My second wish is that we can be happy together as a family. Can you stop dreaming? So one can only dream at a certain age? This is how we met. I'll always have dreams. I can't believe I still have these loans at this age. Have you thought about how I feel? Do you even care about me? I have to work 16 hours a day. Your dream relies solely on my salary. So what? Can you not yell at me? What do you think I'm doing with my music? I'm pushing this dream, and maybe I'll succeed someday. You just can't have what you wish for. No matter how much you want something, you'll be disappointed in the end. There are far too many disappointments in the world. Since you can't avoid them, you can only try to compensate. Food is the easiest and best outlet to let your days slide by. It is important to eat. That's right. What? Want to know who I am? You'll soon find out. Don't tell me that you don't talk to yourself? Do you know you're late then? Can I owe you... You can't. You only need 5. I got it. Thanks. I'll pay you back tomorrow. No worries. It's only 5 bucks. - Zi-shan. - Okay. No. It's only 5, but I still have to pay you back. Sure, it's all good. I bet you didn't know that it all started with pineapple bread, right? "Pineapple Bread" How was it? His comic book is entertaining. Really? Great. This guitar club was prestigious on campus, with freshmen eager to join in. How did it turn into this? Da-ya Da-ya. You tell me. Me? What do you mean? You're the club's president, so yes, you tell us. It's been like this since I took over. I've been trying hard, but it shouldn't be my personal effort. We have numbers. If we can all do our parts, wouldn't it be great? Huh? Look at his hair. It's hilarious. It's so long. Why did he draw it this way? That's weird. I knew someone would agree with me. Thanks. Actually, I want to know... Aren't you buying us breakfast today? Where is it? There are more important things than breakfast in life, Wei-xin. Sorry. Breakfast is here. I'm late because of the milk tea. Milk tea? I thought you were buying us breakfast. Hey, this is grande milk tea. I'm generous, right? This is a waste of my time. Why? See you. Leave me alone. - Xiang Wei-xin. - Yes? I'm sure you're the most enthusiastic one in the club. Did you misinterpret something? I didn't. When I talked to them, they didn't hear a word I said. Our club has an important mission this semester, that is to perform on the school's anniversary. If our presentation is amazing, we'll have a big chance to change people's minds about us. Okay. Do you want to do this with me? What do you mean? Stop pretending. I heard you sing. Your voice is great. Did we go to karaoke together? That's beside the point. My point is have you imagined yourself 15 years down the road? Hey, Bau, have you ever imagined yourself 15 years down the road? Maybe I'll be dead tomorrow. Who cares. Don't slack. I'll be back to check. Got it. Why did you do it? It just happened. I don't know. What do you mean? How could you? It wasn't intentional. It's not about intentions. If you don't care for me, just say it. Can't it be an amicable breakup? But I do care for you. If you do, then why did you do it? Because I care for him too. Well, this is a story about betrayal. Hi. Hi, I finally run into you. When are you going to answer my friend's confession of love? Your friend? Fang Qi-ran. She's a campus belle. It will be rude if you keep her waiting. What's this? Why didn't you say anything about this and that she's a campus belle? You don't tell me everything either. Okay! I don't need to apologize then. Hey, you're welcome. I still owe you 5. Only a tissue? Mind your own business. Xiang Wei-xin, do you need 15 years to clean a hallway? Mind your own business. Shoo. Mom... Mom! Who are you? I am you. You are me? What do you mean by that? I am you in 15 years. I'll gain weight in 15 years? You enjoy eating and don't expect much in life. This is not surprising. Did you think you'd be super hot in the future? At least I'm happy. You are happy, but I am not happy at all, seeing you like this. You have no right to say so. It was your fault that I look like this. You didn't study and you didn't try to date. You only existed. Besides, you said to eat was the happiest thing in the world. I can imagine you gaining weight down the road. Your dream is quite profound. Profound my ass. That image looked so real and horrifying. Was that really a dream? At this rate, You will look like that in 15 years. Or what do you think you'll look like in 15 years? Leave me alone. Zhang Yuan-shuo had the same question. So... did you say yes to the show? I only said yes because I pitied him. Oh please, what does it have to do with pity? You need to work on your guitar skills. Wait a minute. What is he treating? He promised to treat me a milk tea everyday until school anniversary. A milk tea. Who will do something only for a milk tea when it doesn't really interest her? I can't say I'm not interested. Fang Qi-ran. Two guys left breakfast for you at the club. One guy is from next classroom. I don't care to know who they are. Why did you take it? I don't want it. I know you don't want it, so I'll finish it for you. In your dreams. You didn't help, so I'll choose first. Take this one. A bun. I don't want a bun. Stop! You guys! I don't want to waste food since you're not interested. That's right. And they say they will keep on delivering until they can add you on LINE. Go away, or I'll kick your ass. Don't add them on LINE just yet. - Someone's asking for you, We-xin. - Are you even my friend? I'll come to you. He even delivers your milk tea to the door. Did you pick your song yet? Your milk tea. Thanks. Have you decided on your song? Not yet. Hey, we all rely on you now. Okay, see you at the club. You're doomed. You're so doomed. What am I going to do? You should choose a song. How about this one? Can it be simpler? Don't drink my stuff. It has no alcohol. I'm driving you home, of course I can't drink. When you turn 18 next year, we can drink until the end of the world. What kind of a dad are you? Hey, you sound more and more like your mom. Was Mom the way she is now? She loved to work. She's always been a workaholic. She's the same. So what did you like about her? When one has this kind of question, it means it's over. You don't need a reason to like someone. It's like a song. A song? Yes, it's like a song that blows your mind. I think everyone should have their own song. Sometimes it makes you cry; other times it makes you laugh. This painting is still here? You painted this. You haven't found my guitar. Okay, let's put it away. I found it. I remember this song. You wrote it for Mom, right? A song that sometimes makes you laugh and other times makes you cry... Mom, you're back. Dad came here to help me find my guitar. I'm going to perform on school anniversary. So, you want to be a loser like your dad? It's been quite some time. There's no need to be rude. What should I say instead? Let's talk about reality? You haven't wired alimony for last month. I don't think I'll get any for this month either. Last month, I had to renovate my bar. Sure, you've never been short of an excuse for the past 20 years. Take care of yourself first. See you. I'll think about your song. Did you drink again? Do you have to talk to my father like this? Do you have to talk to your mother like this? Dad was here to help me with my guitar. I'm going on stage on school anniversary. So you just want to turn into him. I'm not sure about that, but I don't want to turn into you. All you can talk about is money. Do you have nothing to live for other than working? Of course I have things going on. They are all better than your dad and his guitar. Before you can be independent, save this attitude. I'm already independent. I'm no longer a child. So you can support yourself now? Sure, I won't ask you for allowance from now on. Okay, if you say so. Sure! Tidy up the storage room. Independent, right. This is killing me. How do I play this? Why are you here? It's a public space. Did I interrupt you? Can't you pretend that you didn't hear it? But I already heard it. How can I pretend? - Hey, Wei-xin. - Hold on. I know. Here. For last time. Oh. I'm not here for this. I want to talk to you about the other day. Actually, I should thank you. Later that day, I broke up with my girlfriend. You guys broke up? Yes. If you weren't there and if you hadn't said that, I might've dragged on with her for a while. Now I can breathe. It's quite nice. Do you want some? That's fine. Is Pineapple bread really that yummy? Of course. It's simple and filling. Some look fancy, but it's not necessarily yummy. Simple looks can stand the test of time. Don't you find these squares beautiful? I never heard anyone describe a pineapple bread as a beauty. I don't know what you are talking about. I'm being silly. You can work on your guitar skills. I know that, otherwise how can I go on stage? You're going to perform? Why are you laughing? No one plucks notes on stage. They have to be chords at least, like this. You got some skills. How about this? You helped me last time. I'll help you work on your guitar. Come on. Good luck. Got it. Okay, listen, I saw you play like this here. You can try this... Here. A soy milk, please. You got it. So this is what it feels like to be poor. Mom can I have my allowance back? Please forgive me. A black tea, please. Show some integrity, Xiang Wei-xin. You should take a part-time job. "Weekend Helpers Wanted" Hi. Interested in working here? Is that cool? Cool? I sell hot food. You should say is that good. Is that good? Taiwanese should know their own language. - Who are you texting? - What are you doing? - You should study. - Give it back. Who are you texting? So secretive. Hey, Qi-ran, listen. Your charm doesn't get you two free breakfasts now. It's down to one. I'll eat it. Have your turn tomorrow. From now on, they are all mine, Bau. Don't take a poor girl's breakfast now. Keep flirting with this breakfast boy, Qi-ran. I'm counting on you to feed me. Sure. Was that from your phone? Oh yeah? "I'm sorry, but I'm still at the pool." "Something happened. I might have to cancel today." Last time, you said you have some issues with math. I can help you. It's fine. Then didn't we say to see that movie? Shall we go? I've already seen it. Is it because of that girl? Don't overthink it. Okay, I see. Hi. I'll leave you guys alone. This is a misunderstanding... It's okay now. Stand up. It's okay now. I don't have the key to the female locker room. You okay in there? What do you think? They are too big for you, but it's kind of cute. Why did you show up? Because you said something happened. I got worried. I was okay. She just came to see me out of the blue and wanted us back together. But I am not interested. Anyway, I'll graduate in less than a year. There's no point to do so. Besides, when I think about how she cheated on me, it makes me upset. It is better this way. I think I totally get it. Yeah, right. For you to dry your hair. I'm serious. My parents are a living example. I truly think their breakup is the right decision. One loves his freedom; the other loves herself. They were not happy together at all. Your parents are divorced? Yes. But I'm totally cool with that. Don't pity me. My parents are separated too. My mom is in the US; my dad is in heaven. Don't you pity me. People are coming in. Go in there. Breaststroke practice from yesterday is killing me. My arms are still sore. That's lame. You should practice more. Sure, why don't you do it then, since you are the best? Tao You-quan, you showed up early today. Yeah, to practice early. I thought you love to sleep. It's just for today. Okay, let me change. Don't... this stall is out of order. Out of order? I was just in there yesterday. No, the third stall has the strongest jets. "Tao You-quan, Swimming Team" Then he'll know you are following him. I think you'd better not. This will make you look like a creepy stalker. You blew it up and pasted it there? Yes. Dad drew his Cupid. He always believes that God of Love is out there somewhere. Is that so? Is that so? Your egg tarts have mold on them, Xian. It tastes better with mold. You don't understand. Disgusting. Get rid of them already. Because you didn't want them. You bought them because you said you wanted them. It's fattening. So get rid of them right away. They stink. Can you stop screaming? I feel great. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Wtf? That's not for you. I know that, but I'm thirsty. You can buy yourself one. Why don't you buy it then? Your tea isn't very tasty. It's the thought that counts, okay? You don't understand. Have you heard of the perfect ratio? Perfect ratio. I understand. It's me. Why don't you go to hell? Shuo, Wei-xin has Zero motivation. Can she play solo? Sure she can. Where's breakfast? Where's breakfast, Bau? Bau is taking a break today. You can grab it at their club if you want to eat. No, I'll run into Qi-ran's admirer. It'll be awkward. Is that right? But you don't feel awkward taking his breakfast for me. You got a point. He doesn't know it's me anyway, right? It's not too late to get it. When our teacher is here, just say I'm in the restroom. "Milk Tea" Hi. It's creepy when you don't make a sound. Why? Are you practicing? How's it going? When do you want me to approve it? Approve my song? Mind your own show. I have a teacher. Just wait and see. Okay, I'll wait. I may not be the best club president, but I know a talent when I see one. Your milk tea. Thanks. I wrote that. "Xiang Wei-xin, the cutest girl in the guitar club." You are a nice person. What do you mean? Why do you suddenly friend zone me? I don't. I think when you have a girl, she will be happy. Why? Why will she be happy? Because you live in your own world. Huh? You don't overthink. You are always content and try to have the best life. If you can be with someone like that you'll certainly be happy. And you are like that. Good morning. You're late. I'm sorry. What's wrong? That's... A rice ball. You hungry? Take this half. No need to return the favor. This is from Qi-ran, the president of Dance Club. Every day, some admirer delivers free breakfast, but she doesn't even eat it. So I'm doing her a favor. Don't tell anyone. I don't want to hurt his feelings. This rice ball is super yummy. It's way better than egg pancake roll and sandwich. I hope it's another rice ball tomorrow, and another the day after, and another two days after. A rice ball every day. Why aren't you eating? Give it back if you don't want it. Who says I don't want it? What are you studying? Chinese. Is it hard? It's okay. I'm going to skip class. - What? - Lower your voice. Cover for me in a bit. Where are you going? Have you ever had butterflies in your stomach? And they are big butterflies. Big butterflies? How about small butterflies? Never mind. I don't think you've ever imagined your date. Cover for me in a bit, and say you'll go to Health Center with me. Health Center? I'll go over the wall at the back gate. You don't need to come with me. The teacher is here. Be quiet. Aii arise. Attention. Bow. Good morning to you. Good morning to you guys. Take your seat, everyone. Take your seat. My stomach is upset. Can I go to Health Center? Of course, go. She can help me. I can help her to Health Center. Sure. Hi everyone, please go to page 8. We'll go over the second half of the text. I understand "butterflies in one's stomach". As for future dates, I can think about it anytime. I can even think about it now. We are the swimming team, Wei-xin. We are friends with Tao You-quan. You were in the locker room, right? I wasn't. Zhang Yuan-shuo, Xian, Kuei. Hi. What the hell? Hi Xiang Wei-xin. Bau, you are doomed. You-quan. I can. But I can't. Huh? You-quan? Why are you here? We said to practice this weekend. You gave me this address, okay? Did I? We have to practice? But I have to go to work. I'm late. Talk to you when I'm done. I'll give you a ride. Thanks. Carry my guitar Sure. Hurry up. I thought you are late? Go straight and turn right. You had a lot of breakfast? What do you mean? You're going to be late. Here you go. I'll put this away. You work here? Yep. Do you know you're 10 minutes late? I'm sorry. You're sorry? Oh. Here. Here you go. Why are you here? It wasn't my plan to be here. You two know each other? She's my grandma. What? What'd you like? I'd like a milk tea. A milk tea. Would you like to try our steak and egg burger? It's delicious. Here you go. Help yourselves with the straws. Okay, thanks, auntie. Let me do it. I never like my grandma. My parents met in the US. They got married and had me there. I don't understand why she hates my mom. I came back when I finished elementary school. They didn't get along. When my dad passed away a few years ago, my mom went back to the US for work. Grandma insists that I finish my high school study here, so I couldn't go with my mom. Grandma's stern and annoying. It's like the whole world is against her. You have seen it. I only moved out in 11th grade. Anyway, I just know that I have to get out of here when I finish high school to join my mom. I don't understand the world of grownups. Why do they have to hurt each other when they can just try to get along. There're lots of things that I don't understand either. But it's okay, we can learn as we grow. So are we practicing or not? Yes. I'm listening. Here. What bang? Is that wrong? Oh. Not bad. Really? Want some? It's fine. Later. Let's practice first. Come on. Good luck. Keep it up. Today's rice ball is cool. Hey, do you guys enjoy the show for today? Raise your hands, people up there! 5, 6, 7, 8 Who are you? I'm you in 15 years. Me in 15 years? I lost weight. Do you prefer this version? Do you mean a girl who loves to sing? I mean a girl who's more confident and loves herself more. What are you looking at? I don't know. It's hard to imagine. It almost seems impossible. There's no such thing as impossible. Once you think so, nothing will ever be possible. Let's rehearse from the beginning. Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8 1, 2, 3, hurry up. Wow, Dance Club's really good. I guess you have only someone in your eyes. You mean Qi-ran? She's the main dancer. It's hard not to see her. Hey, listen. I think you have a chance. What chance? Do you like this milk tea? Yes. "Nervous?" "I have a feeling. You'll kick ass." What are you guys doing? You-quan is here. We're doing some skincare for tomorrow's show. Feel it. We have two masks left. Want one? "Okay, good night." "Good night." Xiang Wei-xin. You scared the shit out of me. Where's Qi-ran? She is at the club. Is that so? Then I'll go grab her breakfast and see how hot she is today. Your breakfast. My breakfast? I deliver it every day. But I never eat it. I know that you never eat it. Then why do you keep on delivering it? I'll deliver it until the day you add me on LINE. It doesn't matter. I just feel like it. Sure, thanks. Where's Yuan-shuo? Over there. - I'll head on out first. - Wait up. Help me to check if I forget anything. Do you deliver breakfast to Qi-ran every day? What are you talking about? Do you have a thing for Qi-ran? What? No, I don't, okay? Then why do you treat her to breakfast? I didn't do that. Stop pretending. I saw it. I saw you put it in her locker. Oh. You mean that one time? I sent it for someone else. Someone else. Who is that? My roommate. A schoolmate. Tao You-quan? Yes. His girlfriend cheated on him and someone said Qi-ran had a crush on him. He started to deliver breakfast every day just to piss his ex off. But I think his feelings for her must be real, otherwise why would he keep it up for a semester? Let's give it up for Dance Club. One moment, please. Wei-xin still hasn't answered the phone. Where the hell is she, Kuei-an? I can't find her. Maybe she's in the back? She's not. - Why did you say to her? - Where the hell did she go? What should we do now? It's all your fault. Take care of it. What can I do? Hey, Guitar Club, get ready. You're up next. Got it. We'll go right away. What are you going to do? I'll take care of it, okay? Da-ya, Dan-dan, you guys are ready, right? You guys go on first. - We'll address the issue. - Will do. I told you she doesn't have it, but you insisted and backed her up. Just go to the back to check for one more time. Cut it out and go to supervise them. I told you I couldn't find her. It turns out he's into Qi-ran all along. And I made that happen. Are you sulking? No one's sulking. Okay, no worries. So tell me. Have you ever revealed your feelings to him? What feelings? To who? I don't have feelings to anyone. Look at you, won't even admit it. Poor you. Who's poor? It's sad. Think about it. If you go on like this, maybe you will never find love. Never find love? If you don't try to be brave this time, will you live in regret for the rest of your life? You don't even have the courage to admit it. Do you think anyone will like a girl like this? Is it that hard to be honest? Hey. Are you new to the school? I never saw you before. You really got some moves up there. - Can we add each other on LINE? - Let's go. I'm a guy. Excuse me. Don't you worry, Yuan-shuo. I can cover for Wei-xin. You are here. Xiang Wei-xin, where did you go? The whole world is waiting for you. Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm fine. And I'm sorry. You should apologize. Don't say that. Everyone should have their own song. Sometimes it makes you cry; other times it makes you laugh. I'd like to dedicate this song to a friend, so I can say, thank you. I had a great time this semester. "The wind is here, and the clouds disperse." "What future will I see?" "The rain is gone, and where are the rainbows?" "I'll remember what's disappeared." "The wounds will heal." "What is eternity?" "Waking up from a dream." "I sing, at this moment." "Your humming. Can't let go." "Include my most beloved in a song," "so I can sing about you." "At this moment, this song" "is all I can give you." "Why did we part our ways?" "I felt alive when I met you." "I finally understand." "Here you come; here you go." "Can't keep you, so I'm waiting." "Say goodbye. Where are the tears?" "Cross the river of life." "Walk against the light." "I have no fear with you by my side." "Be brave." "I sing, at this moment." "Your humming. Can't let go." "Include my most beloved in a song," "so I can sing about you." "At this moment, I give you this song." "May us be happier." "Believe me with a smile." "You'll be a song in my heart," "forever playing." "You were really good up there." "Where are you?" You're back. Why didn't you remind me about your show? I'm glad I put it in my calendar. You were really good. What's wrong? What's wrong, Wei-xin? Nothing. I'm just too happy. I didn't know you'd come to my show. It's been some time since you cooked for me. You also sang what was on your mind to him, right? Have some. When I was 18, I sang to the one I loved too. He found it hilarious. But I still remember that feeling. It felt good to say it out loud. Even though we're not together anymore, I don't regret it. I still like him. But the way I see it, you don't have to have someone. Do you still like Dad? I made chicken soup with mushrooms for you. Here, have some. Let's stop crying after the soup, okay? Okay. Who is it? It hurts. Why? I was gentle. Why are you mad? What's wrong? Did I hurt you? Okay, I'm sorry. But it's you who should apologize. You vanished after the show and you didn't text me back. What's wrong? My dad came to my show. I was busy spending time with him. Do you know everyone liked your show? Really? I'm thinking that since the winter vacation is coming, let's do another song? I think I'll pass for now. Hey, what's wrong? I forgot that I have to discuss homework with Bau before the first class, so see you later. We'll talk soon. So what's wrong? I've made my decision. What do you mean by that? How about what I feel? It's none of my business. That's too much. What's up? You can't leave until we talk it out. What are you doing? She's a girl. I know. I know she's a campus belle. A campus belle needs annoying admirers like you to the rescue. Do your job. Guan Hau-wei. Stop! Stop! Guan Hau-wei. Stop! He is my first love. I ran into him when school was about to start. Guan Hau-wei. What are you doing here? I went to an exhibition. I am now taking a walk since the weather is nice. How have you been? I'm the same. Miss Lin, my stomach is upset. Can I go to Health Center? We haven't forgotten about each other. So we're back on dating again. Hello. For two? What? Have you been to our restaurant? No. So here's our menu. Here's our Wagyu set meal at 4380 TWD. It includes a salad, a choice of meat or seafood, a dessert, and a beverage. If it's too big for you, we also have a la carte menu to choose from. We'll have a 10% service charge. Maybe we'll come back. - Of course, no worries. - Thanks. Have a great day. Bye. Let's go. I prefer something else. Dig in. How come you never brought me here? It was always full. Full? Or it wasn't open. Excuse me. I remember you love dried tofu. Fang Qi-ran. It's the President of the Class Federation. Let's go and meet him. Your performance was amazing. No one could take their eyes off of you. Thank you. Can I take a photo with you? - Of course. - Sure, of course. Say "cheese". Cheese. Do you know who delivered Koala's March to you every day? It's the President. He has a crush on you. Date him... He can't overcome his self-doubt. And I'm done begging him to come back. I'll have new dates anyway. Who does he think he is? But I got You-quan invoived and he was called to the office, I feel awful about that. Don't worry. You-quan has a huge crush on you. He won't mind. Really? Your grandson started a fight on campus. We'll have to abide by school regulations. He could be expelled from school. Do you know that? Please don't do that. This is his last year here. It may not end well for his university application. Please pay more attention to his needs and intervene when necessary. I will. Thank you, sir. Why did you do that? What was that? What's this? Your breakfast. But I always let you have it. I don't want it anymore. I will never eat your breakfast again. I'll throw it away then. Don't. I'll have it, for one last time. Sure, enjoy. Is it acceptable? This is not for you. You-quan got them for your best friend, but you eat them all. How can you do this? I know this is not okay, but it's too yummy! It's cucumber with tuna today. So refreshing. "You-quan" Who cares about Hau-wei? You-quan is a much better choice. So you do like him? I can. After all, he's been delivering my breakfast. Don't you think he's better than Hao-wei? En... If I can control my diet, of course I can control my feelings towards a guy, right? You really can? I prefer to make my own yogurt, because I think that's the best for me. I can also choose the best guy for me. You-quan is that guy. He's a really nice guy. Let me help you guys then. You-quan. Hi. You are here for the movie too? Yes, Wei-xin said to meet here and she already reserved the tickets. Wei-xin asked me too. You mean she asked both of us? I don't think she's gonna show up. She texted me yesterday and asked me to grab the tickets first. There are only two tickets. And then you showed up. "Sorry, but I have to tidy up the club. Enjoy the movie, you two." - I think... - Actually, I... Hey, let me answer this call. Sure. Hello? You-quan, I have to go. Something came up. No worries. Go. I'll get a refund. Okay, thanks. See you. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. You'd better be there. Whoa, you showed up. I'm so moved. Whenever I want to clean the club, everyone is suddenly busy. But is it true? You are the best. Let's tidy up. Sure. It's really dusty. What's wrong? Nothing. I did a really cool thing today. Then shouldn't you be happy about it? Why are you almost in tears? Have you ever been into someone? Yes. Then you should understand. I am into someone. I thought he was also into me. But it's only my wishful thinking. He never cares for me, never ever. Am I an idiot? He is an idiot. No need to make me feel better. I just want to complain. I'll be fine after I'm done venting. I'm not trying to make you feel better. I'm serious. I am into you. Are you messing with me? I am not messing with you. I liked you from the moment you joined the club. Tomorrow at 7 a.m. Don't forget. Sure, see you tomorrow. It's hot. Can I borrow it? Granny. Granny. How is my grandma? She's fine now. She slipped and bumped her head in the bathroom this morning. When I called, she said she just needed a rest. That worried me, so I sent her here right away. Thank you. She's lucky to have you. The doctor said she is okay now, and she can go home. But we have to monitor her for 48 hours. If something goes wrong, she has to come back. Got it. Why did you come? Are you alright? I won't die yet. Hey, why did you do that? I only asked you to send me to the hospital. Why did you ask him to come over? Please don't say that. Let's go. No, go where? I'll take care of you for the next two days. No need. I don't need that. You do. You live alone. And the doctor said to monitor for 48 hours. I wonder if my love for rice balls started from a long time ago. "Rice Ball" Granny is finally taking a break. Why didn't you come up? It's fine. She doesn't like me in her house. That's how she is, but she doesn't mean it. I'll have to suffer for the next few days. You are the same. You obviously care about your grandma, but you act like you hate her. Don't you think this is how people are? They don't talk about their feelings. See how everyone loves to go on Facebook? But when you ask about how they feel in person, most of them will say, I'm good. No worries. It seems that we are all like this. Take me, for exam pie; I am like that too. I have to go back to the dorm to grab some stuff. I'll stay with my grandma for a few days. Well, but I am moving back soon. I'm about to graduate. Yes. Time flies. A school year is coming to an end. If there's nothing else, I'm gonna go. Bye. I wish you and Yuan-shuo happiness. Me and Yuan-shuo? It's okay to let me know. What do you mean? You didn't show up for the movie, so I went to the club to see you. And? I overheard your conversation. I don't think you heard all of it. I am into you. Are you messing with me? I am not messing with you. I liked you from the moment you joined the club. No, it should be when I heard you sing for the first time, I fell for you. But... the feelings are not mutual. Is that so? I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for me. I didn't know you'd have a thing for me. I am lazy, and I eat too much. I am not perfect. I am not hot either. Perfection. What can you do with perfection? Can you eat it? Don't sell yourself short. I won't be happier with you saying so. Thank you for your honesty. Actually, this is great. Look, you're being frank with me now will stop me from imagining next year what kind of possibility we can have. We can still be friends, just like before, and forget about this. And I can still fall in love with other girls. Let's wrap it up for today. I'll finish it tomorrow. Oh, I forgot. Your milk tea. Be sad no more, Yuan-shuo. What's vexing you? Tell me now and let Kuei fix it for you. In your state... Fuck you. Just shut up. Wtf? I'm just trying to cheer you up. I just want some peace. It's annoying. Falling out of love won't kill you. And it doesn't mean others won't be into you. So who will be into me? Me. Yeah, right. But I am not into you. So that's how it fee is to say this. "It makes me realize from a distance" "that my love for you is hard on you." "But the world is not as simple as I thought," "even though I couldn't be sad enough, it still came as a surprise." "Maybe without expectations," "I won't be broken time after time." "Just maybe." "I wish you were here," "And I wish time could teach me how to bow out with grace," "so you would be relieved." "The lonely feeling when you come into my mind again" "is the most beautiful regret." Xiang Wei-xin. Here's the breakfast. Shall I deliver for you? Sure. Bye. Here's your breakfast. I want to tell you something. I'm in love again. You're in love with You-quan? It's Hau-wei. Well, I only have a shitty scooter, and I'm not good with books. I can't compete with your President of Class Federation. I don't deserve you. I thought everything would be cool if I pushed you away. But it wasn't. Because I'm head over heels for you. I know I don't deserve you. But give me some time, I'll try harder, and I'll work harder. And then? We decided to date each other again. No matter what the future might hold, at least we have no regret at this moment. So what about You-quan? Nothing is going on between us. I don't need to do anything. You can't say that. He's been delivering you breakfast for a whole year, but now you're back with Hau-wei? Why don't you date him then? What are you talking about? You are the one he's into, not me. Those breakfasts were for you. But you ate them all. You ate the whole year's breakfasts. I know that. I'm a pig. No, I can't bear to see him sad. He can not know that you got a boyfriend. If he knows, he will be heartbroken. That's right. He will graduate without hiccups. I can't let him know I must not let him know. Say nothing. You-quan, If you want to cry, it's okay. I wish him happiness. You-quan. No one else is here. It's okay to cry. But I don't want to cry. No need to repress yourself. Really, I'm fine. No one has to be with someone. Their affection for each other is mutual. Isn't that great? I'll graduate in less than a month. I'll pretend that I know nothing and keep on delivering breakfast until the very last day. So I finish what I started. It's hot. Summer is coming. You-quan. Oh, my grandma is closing down her breakfast place. Is she well? She's fine. My mom found out about my grandma's incident. She got worried and came back. After ignoring each other for years, they are finally good. Mom, your favorite shrimp rolls. Here you go. Mom, here you go. Here you go. You love this dish. - Here, you love it too. - Thanks, Grandma. Mom, here... I have it here. We haven't enjoyed a meal together in a long time. Mom, have some more. For your grandma. Here, Grandma. Careful. It's hot. Have some more. Can you only understand what's important when you got older? How old is older? In 15 years, we'll be in our 30s. Is it old enough? I think so. So what do you imagine yourself in 15 years? I don't know. Do you know? I know. I know what you'll turn out to be. Are you a fortune-teller? I can't tell fortune, but I see people. It's been almost a year. I think I know you by now. In 15 years, Tao You-quan will already be supposedly out of love for 10 times. 10 times? Yep. Because he's an indecisive person. He's been into someone for almost a year, but he just keeps on delivering breakfast without saying a word. For a guy like this, being out of love for 10 times is not a lot. He proposed to this current girlfriend. Unfortunately, she doesn't plan to get married and returns the ring. He's cute and responsible. He's always first to go to work, but he just has no luck with love. But he doesn't give up. He's loyal and filial. His next girlfriend will just be around the corner. And this time, she will say yes to him. Because eventually, a great girl will see him and cherish him. Maybe you should write a novel. Don't talk about me. How about you? I have different versions of myself. But I'd like to know your version. In 15 years, Xiang Wei-xin should still be single. Because she's shy and she keeps things to herself, assuming she can take care of anything. So she has no luck. I'm not finished yet. But as a persistent Taurus, she can take it. She has a steady job in a company, and she's about to be promoted. But she has no luck with love. Her history of love is blank. How come? Let me finish. Because she's about to meet her Mr. Right. Her long wait will finally be worth it. In the end, she will be happy, very happy. Is that so? I'll be happy? Without a doubt. Will we still be friends then? Who knows? When we graduate, we will face a different world. When we have a chance to meet, it's often at the class reunion. That's right. It seems so. C'est la vie. What vie? You make it sound like it's really been 15 years. Alright. I have to go. Okay. So, goodbye. Bye. Do you like this kind of life? I know I have nothing nice to say. You had his breakfast for a whole year, but you decided to keep this secret forever. Do you like this version of yourself in 15 years? I'm sorry, You-quan, but I ate all your breakfast. Forgive me, but your warm gesture to Qi-ran ended up in my stomach. I shouldn't have done that. But I still want to say that I'm into you. Yes, I'm into you. But I don't dare to say so. I can't say so. Because this will make you uneasy. Qi-ran is the perfect one for you, but she got a boyfriend now. Don't be sad. You'll meet a great girl in the future. Hi Wei-xin, I knew all along that you had all the breakfast. I've been meaning to tell you. However, the time never seemed right. But when is the right time? Feels like I won't have the courage to say it until it's coming to an end. Thank you for having my breakfast this year. I started to deliver breakfast out of frustration. But never have I thought that we'd get closer, and I also found out that you had all the breakfast. But it's all good. What is this? A rice ball. You hungry? I'm serious. It's all good. This rice ball is super yummy. It's way better than egg pancake roll and sandwich. I wish the school would have soft-bild eggs. They are soft and yummy, really satisfying. Hey, they put a soft-boiled egg in! I'm stressed out, and I have no appetite. Yeah, right. You'll always have an appetite even if it's the end of the world. If the ingredients are more refreshing, then of course. Don't you think asparagus tastes funky? I hate asparagus. I thought it was refreshing. Nothing. "She hates asparagus." It's cucumber with tuna today. So refreshing! "Xiang Wei-xin: Yes, I'm into you. But I don't dare to say so. I can't say so." "That wind, replacing my arms around you." "Your hands by my heart playing." "Forget me not." "Counting dreams backwards, all memories held in my heart." "To leave you, it's so painful." "Want to start over." "Want to know what you're thinking." "Not admitting my pain." "Can't find the right moment." "Afraid of losing you," "It's why I did not say I love you." I don't like how we've turned out in 15 years. Me neither. I'm into you, You-quan. Hey, I'd like to say "thank you" for that day. Good morning. Good morning. - Here. - What are we having today? Guess. - Nice, right? - I love it. What's this? You put a lot of thought. Here. What's this? This... Do you like it? Which one do you prefer? This one then. Thank you for being brave 15 years ago. Thank you for accepting your true feelings 15 years ago. Now, I'm in a perfect spot. Thank you.
