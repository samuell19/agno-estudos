[♪] Flight Number 7 took off. Now, men, you know your objective? Instructions all clear? Aye. Aye, aye. Okay, men. Scramble off, my lads. [ENGINE WHIRS] Hey. Did you do the corners? Why, certainly. Hey, what's that? It's my lunch. Why, you. Mm-mm! Get it outta here. I'm sick of this. We came overseas to join the RAF, and we're still civilians working in a garage. How did we know you'd have to pass an intelligence test? And what did you answer when they asked, "What does a navigator do?" I told 'em a navigator crawls in a swamp until it becomes a suitcase. And bites like this too. Grrowrr! No. Like this. Mm! Go on. Get started. Switch on. Switch on. [WHINES, STOPS] Switch on! It is on. [WHINES, STOPS] Pfft. Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah-ah! [CHUCKLING] [ALL LAUGH] Ohh! [ALL GRUNT] Hey, is that all you got to do? Lay down on the job? Why don't you stick out your hand when you make a U-turn? This is Colonel Henderson's car, and it's got a little squeak in it. It's driving the colonel nuts. I want it taken out. Savvy? Leave it to us. We'll squelch that squeak in nothing flat. And I want it fixed by 3:00, or else. Or else what? Or else this! [BONES CRUNCH] Okay, men, to work. Hike! Hike. Hike. Ooh! Ah-ah-ah-ah! Ah! What are you looking for? I'm looking for the squeak. [CLANGING] Oh. I'm sorry, Moe. Did it hurt? No. Oh, I'm glad. Does this? Ah-ah-ah. Ah. Oh! Oh! Ow! Oh! Get out of here! [CRASH] [CRANKS ENGINE] [CRANKS ENGINE] [SPITS] [CRANKS ENGINE] Hey. Go away. I'm busy. Nyuh-ah-ah! Burglars! Oh! I didn't know it was you, Moe. Come on out of that car. Get up there and take care of the motor. Mmm! Mmm! Ahh! [GRUNTING] Ooh! Oh. A navigator.

See if you can find a squeak. Mm! Yah! Ugh! Help! Help! Get me out! [GRUNTS] Help! Help! What are you doing down there, Moe? Get me out. I'm suffocating. Come on, we got to get him out. Oh! Oh! Ooh!

You'll never get this thing together in time. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Hey, here comes Kelly. I'll stall him off while you guys get the parts back in. Nyuh! Hello, Kelly. You're a little early. How early? Well, roughly, about two days, when you smooth it out about a fortnight. [LAUGHS] Look, I don't like jokes, understand? Hm, looks pretty good. Say, that windshield looks so clean you wouldn't know there was any glass in it. You said it. Ooh! Did you get that squeak out? Boy, we got everything out. [SPITS] I'll drive it right out. Now, wait a minute, Kelly. Listen. There's one little thing that I-- Never mind, I'm in a hurry. [ENGINE STARTS, HUMS] Sounds good. Don't forget to put in a good word to the colonel. Yeah, we still want to be flyers. And wear wings. [METAL CLATTERING] So you wanted wings, eh? Certainly. Well, if this is what I think it is, you'll get your wings, and a harp with 'em. Ooh! Come on!
