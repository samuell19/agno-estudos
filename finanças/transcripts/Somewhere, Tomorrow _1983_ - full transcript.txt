(gentle music) - [Man] Controls to three dispatch I've got a phone patch for you. - [Man] This is three put it through. - [Woman] Officer Peiski. Am I hooked up? - [Peiski] Yes ma'am go ahead. - [Woman] This is Miss O'Shay at the hospital, I'm calling for Mrs. Anderson. She wants you to come down here right away. - Is Lori worse? - [O'Shay] She's been moved to the intensive care unit. (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) - [Man] Alec. - Doc how is she? - Let's go to the lounge, Betty's there. - She was real close to her father. Doug had to work long hard hours but he always managed to find time for Lori. He just loved her, he just loved her so much. - Did this thing start happening when, at the time of his death? - I don't know, maybe it started then. Listen I just wanna be in there with her. - Betty we have to talk about this. I have a problem that I don't know how to deal with. I've got a little girl in there took a spill off a horse and got a bump on the head. A mild concussion nothing more but she refuses to wake up. A perfectly healthy 16 year old girl. Who I think wants to die. You've gotta help me reach her. - Betty. - It's all so crazy I just, I don't know where to start. (dramatic music) - George look out. - There's something in my eye. - Something in your eye? Look out, you'll never make it. (crashing) (dramatic music) - Guess I'll never hear the last of this. - Oh look at my car. I told you to slow up would you? Oh no. - [Man] Can I help it if a tire blows out? Besides I had something in my eye. - [Lady] Couldn't have been your driving could it? - [Man] I've come around that curve much faster lots of times, so have you. - Why George you're getting transparent, you're fading. - Say that's funny, I can see through you to. Say, who's that. - It's us, you know something George, I think we're dead. - I think you're right. Funny, I don't feel any different. - [Lady] Oh neither do I. Now I wonder what happens. - [Man] I don't know. I suppose pretty soon we'll hear trumpets and off we go. - Hey Alec. - [Man] I hope we go together honey. - [Lady] So do I. - Want some coffee, take the chill off? - That sounds great. It's really cold. Thank you ma'am. - Lori, Alec is here. - Yeah, I'm busy mom. - Arian, what do you suppose is the conventional thing to do now? - I don't know. We've never been conventional. - Okay Sam. (engine rumbling) - Hey Paul, what's happening? - Same old thing Mr. Stockton, having to beat the ladies off with a stick. - Yeah well don't hit 'em to hard you may need 'em someday. (laughing) - So dad when ma gets home can you tell her I'm not gonna need the car, Paul's gonna drive me over to the airport then we're gonna take off to the movies. - You got all the stuff for the plane? - Right here. - Alright, now don't stay out to late, you boys should get an early start tomorrow. (engine rumbling) (honks) (engine rumbling) - Hi. - Jeez you got a pretty old lady. - You mean my old lady's pretty, or do you mean my moms pretty old? - Well either way I lose right? - Right. (rattling) (honks) - Hey how about letting me attach the plane up to the pump. - I filled it last night after we got back. Margie and I did a little night flying. - Oh yeah? I'll bet you spent most of the time on auto pilot. (chuckles) (engine rumbling) So you gonna be back in time for school on Monday? - Oh yeah probably. I just wanna stay long enough to make sure she accepts the stallion. - You always follow your horse into the bedroom? - No not usually. But Polly had a bad time with Johnson's old stud last time we tried to breed her. She's kinda special to me. Had her since I was eight. - Is that why you're sending her to the lady in Flemington? - Yeah and this lady's got a real good stud but she needs the money so I can afford the fee. - I thought you're supposed to do the inspection just before you fly? - I'll get it over with now, it's gonna be cold and dark when we get here in the morning. ♪ To find you ♪ Anytime I choose ♪ But why should I take chances ♪ ♪ There's far to much to lose ♪ So I'll keep myself in my world ♪ ♪ And you in fantasy ♪ If I can't hold you in my arms I'll hide you in a dream ♪ ♪ Oh tell me why ♪ You're on my mind so very near ♪ ♪ So hard to find come to my world ♪ ♪ Leave yours behind ♪ So close at hand it's yours to find ♪ - Mom you scared me. - That was real nice.

When'd you catalog this thing? - Just the afternoon, we got ground water in the tank. - Take it easy girl. Just relax and I'll take you for a nice gallop okay? Do you miss your folks? Yeah well they're gonna be here real soon. You know they bought you a fine husband. Yeah. I think you're gonna like old Bo he's a good gentlemen. - Nice looking mare. - Yeah - Think Bo's gonna take to her? - More than likely. Never been to choosy. - Well that's the way it is with most men. - Was never like that with daddy. - Nope, your daddies eyes never wandered. I was always trying to figure out whether if it was because he was to busy trying to make money or cause he never made any. - Maybe it was because he loved you. - Yeah that's a possibility. Lori tell me something, you like living here? - Course I do it's my home. - Yeah but how would you feel about living in town. You don't get much time to spend with your friends. - I see my friends enough. - Yeah but in town you could be dating and involved. - You wanna live in town and leave the place that daddy worked so hard for? - Lori Alec has asked me to marry him. We just can't keep this place going on our own. And we certainly can't afford to hire help. - And that's why you wanna marry Alec? - Honey listen to me I wanna marry Alec cause I love him. - Don't tell me that I don't wanna hear that. (hooves clattering) (engine rumbling) - [Paul] We just crossed the out town radio. - Alright, pull a little power. Start a 300 foot per minute descent. Easy on the throttle Paul. - Terry I was being easy with it, think we picked up some carb ice. - It seems okay now. Probably sucked it through. You better pull a little car a feet though. - Terry what the hell is wrong with this thing? - I don't know. (engine popping) (hooves clattering) Close to Sky Manor, see if you can find their strip. - Can you find the mail man? - We're to low, you gotta find it with your eyes. (engine popping) - [Paul] We're loosing altitude. (hooves clattering) (engine popping) - [Terry] Look for a clearing. - What are you doing? - Putting out a distress call. - [Paul] Going in? - [Terry] If I can keep this engine running. Mayday, mayday, sesna 89160 engine trouble, possible crash landing. Just south east of Sky Manor, we'll try to make the airport. - [Radio] Understand, sesna transmitting 12021.5, possible of airport south east of Sky Manor. Are you on a flight plan and do you have an emergency locator transmitter on board. - Affirmative on both. - [Radio] Roger, I'll asses your situation on landing, we'll put search and rescue on standby, good luck. (engine popping) - That cuts it, 160's going in. - [Paul] Terry, turn around there's a clearing in the woods or something, over there. (crashing) (rustling) (groans) (rustling) - Are you okay? - I don't feel so well. - Where does it hurt? - Everywhere. - Listen you've gotta lie still and I'm gonna go for some help okay? - Hey Paul, how's my friend. - He's breathing. Just lie still and I'm gonna get some help okay? - Help me. - Come on, don't move okay? Come on. Come on Polly, hold still please? Come girl, it's okay. Damn it Polly hold still please, come on. Easy girl, come on Polly, please. Damn Polly. Polly. (neighs) (engine rumbling) Polly? Polly? Polly! (engine rumbling) (sirens) - Rescue squad this is chopper, over. - This is rescue chopper go ahead. - [Pilot] FA advises, two souls on board. - We've only got one, the other must have wandered off. Chopper you stay put as long as you can, the other guy was able to walk, he'll head back here. - I'll have a look around, out. (chopping) - Been listening on the radio, we'll take a look a round for the other guy. This one okay? - Lori, what in gods name are doing here? - [Doctor] She saw it happen. - I'm gonna wanna talk to you in a little while. - I gotta go cause it's getting really dark and my horse ran off and I gotta find her and get home okay? - Alright I'll stop by later, but be careful huh? Good luck with the horse. (water rushing) (engine rumbling) - We gotta go down to the hospital, you want a lift outta here? - No thanks, I've gotta find the horse. - Does you mom know you're out riding. - Yeah. - Okay I'll be down to your place tomorrow. - Oh did you find the boy? (engine rumbling) Polly? (water rushing) (neighs) - My God it's a horse. Easy boy. Easy fella. Stay right where you are I'm coming. Easy fella, easy boy. Stand, stand, easy, that's it. What are you doing out here all tacked up. Polly? - Polly? Polly! Polly? Polly? (rustling) Polly is that you? Polly. - How'd you know her name? - It's you you're alright. - Yeah I guess so, who are you? - I saw your plane go down, I found you and your friend. - The plane, where is it? Where's Paul my friend? - Here we go. - He's been assigned to ward 17, how is he? - Nothing broken, just a bump on the head. They've got him sedated, go ahead. Here's his stuff. - Lori, what are you doing here? I thought you said you were going home. - [Lori] Well we came to see how that boy was. - He's in shock, he's got a concussion but he's gonna be fine. - Alec I'd like you to meet. - I called your mother i didn't want her to worry, but you gotta let her know where you are. - Yeah okay I will thanks, listen this is. - Did you find your horse? - Yeah don't you want to meet? - Okay listen I gotta go, we can talk about this tomorrow, I'm coming out for dinner anyway. - Excuse me I have to go call my mom. No, yeah I'm fine, I'm at the hospital. (clears throat) - Excuse me I was wondering if there was any word on Paul Bart. - Your folks and Paul's dad just landed at Gus's airport so my moms bringing them down here. - Okay. - I beg your pardon? - Oh I wasn't talking to you. Let's go sit down. - Yeah is there candy machine around here? - Yeah follow me. (banging) - Damn, my last quarter. - I don't have anymore change, sorry. Isn't that your friend Paul? - Yeah. Wait a minute, wait till the nurse leaves. Kay let's go. - He's sleeping. - They probably gave him something. Paul? Hey Paul. It's probably better to let him rest. Seems to be breathing okay. - [Lori] Yeah. Why don't we just sit here and wait. - I am so so tired. - Do you remember much of what happened? - Yeah we lost our engine, I think we got some bad fuel. - What do you think your dads gonna say? You know, about the wreck. - He's not gonna be to happy about it but he's not gonna get crazy either. He's real good that way. He'll just be glad that nobody was hurt. Or killed. - Yeah my dad would like that to. He always seemed to understand. You know I always knew that, that he'd stand by me if I messed up or something. - Is you dad dead? - Yeah. - Good fathers are hard to find, we were both just lucky I guess. - I'd like, I try to keep him part of my life ya know? Sometimes I pretend that maybe he's in the north field or something. Maybe, maybe he's in town. I pretend he's gonna come home for dinner. - I guess I'd feel the same way if I lost my dad. But you can't let yourself go on like that to long. - I don't think I'll ever stop missing my dad. - I didn't say stop missing him. Just don't stop living. Look if your dad was anything like my dad I'm sure he'd say that there's nothing better than living and making every day count. My dads real big on making everyday count for something. He says if you can't look forward to tomorrow then you must have screwed up today. (engine rumbling) - Terry, I'm gonna go get a drink of water and see if my moms here. Kay. (crying) - Lori? - Oh mom hi. - Hi honey, come here sit down. Well you've had quite the night haven't you? - Yeah. - Son? Son. Thank God. - So anyway there I am al alone on the fire break and it's really eerie and there all these kinds of weird sounds and the moon light is coming right down through the trees and then all of a sudden I head this noise. - What was it? - It was Polly the Stockton's horse. But listen, there was somebody riding her, she wasn't alone. - What do you mean somebody riding her, who? - Terry Stockton, see that was the first time I had met him, he'd wandered away from the crash and he'd found Polly. Mom what's wrong? - Lori when Polly got scared like that and you fell off of her did you hurt yourself at all? - No. And the boy that found Polly, where is he now? - Well here's right here, he's in Paul Bart's room. - Lori listen to me. Somebody has played a very cruel, cruel trick on you. Honey Terry Stockton was killed in that plane crash. - Mom that's crazy. Terry Stockton is here. There's been a big mix up. No mom I'll get him, I'll show you, he's here. - God Lori. - I'm sorry to have to put you through this Mr. Stockton but I'm afraid it's necessary. - I understand. - Mr. Stockton? - That's Terry. (gasps) - Hi. How are you feeling? - Okay, is my mom here? - She's in the cafeteria grabbing some breakfast, she asked me to sit with you. - Oh. - You want I should get her or should we let her finish eating or. - I'm sorry about your friend. - So am I. - Yeah, yeah we can let her finish. - Yeah she won't be long. - I don't think we've been really introduced, I'm Lori Anderson. - Paul Bart, glad to know you. - It's good. Did anyone say anything about me, did they tell you anything? - I heard a little. - I saw him Paul, do you believe that. - No. - But it's couldn't have been a dream. - They said you got thrown off a horse, you coulda hurt your head. - It was all so real. - I heard what happened. - What did you hear? - That you saw a plane crash and. - And what, what else did you hear? - My mom works at the hospital. - Yeah? - what did he look like Lori? Was he handsome? - Yeah. - Tell me about him, what did he say what did he do? - Look Sandy I was hit on the head or something, I don't know. But since it never really happened there's no point in discussing it right? - I guess not but it's like, it's like having some kind of dream lover. I mean it's so romantic. Lori. Think you'll ever see him again. - I wouldn't mind. - Betty at least talk to me about it. I'm supposed to on a 202 right now chasing people and I'm hanging around here like a love sick schoolboy instead. At least give me the time of day. - I gotta make sure it's right with Lori first. After what's happened I just don't think this is the right time. - You know people always find reasons to put of what they don't wanna face. - That's unfair. Alec, I wanna marry you. - Well that's a step in the right direction. You never said that before. - [Betty] I didn't think I had to. - Betty, the kid is running your life right now. She's got you on hell of a guilt trip. We're gonna have to face the question sooner or later. She's gonna have to face it. And I say sooner. - Okay. Okay. Compromise? You agree to wait a little longer, just, just until I feel that Lori can handle it. And then we'll. Oh boy, what I'm trying to say is yes, yes I will marry you. (ringing) - Hello? No it's not, this is her daughter. Yes. Paul. Yeah I'm fine how are you? - I'm healing okay, yeah. It's tough, the funeral was yesterday. He's okay but Mrs. Stockton's in pretty rough shape, yeah. Well anyhow Lori the reason I was calling was Mrs.Stockton asked me to ring up and see if it'd be okay to board Polly up there a few more weeks. He's not sure yet what he's gonna do with her. Great Lori, thanks. Well listen I'll see ya, maybe I'll take a drive up that way some Saturday. Okay good. - Get your feet off the desk. Is that the young lady from Flemington? - Yeah Lori. - How is she? - Well she's okay I guess, she had a pretty weird experience. - Well the mind is a strange and powerful thing. - Sure is. You now I had a long talk with her and she really believed she saw Terry. - Well there's always a possibility she did. - Right. - My line a work I learned to consider all the possibilities.

You all set? - Yeah, yeah. Lori I'm leaving. - Something wrong, you seem a little nervous. - It's Lori, she's not the same since she go back from the hospital. I think she's worse than when Doug died. (thundering) Oh honey listen we'll be back right after the movies - Well we may stop for a hamburger. (thunders) - Are you gonna be okay? - I've got plenty of homework. - Have you got candles in case the power goes? - I know where they are. - Okay, be good. (thundering) - [Alec] You just don't see how she's manipulating you. - Alec I'm not stupid, I know what she's doing I'm just worried about why she's doing it. I suppose it's us. - We'll partly. And because she was so close to her father to that's part of it. But the biggest thing I think is she's just trying to figure exactly when we fell in love. - What do you mean? - Well I've sort of been part of the scene her whole life. But sometime after Doug's death when she realized that you and I were a thing she maybe just started wondering. - Because you were always around you think she wonders when it started? That is ludicrous. - Well maybe she understood a few things that you didn't. (raining) (thunders) - Damn. (thundering) (wind whistling) (neighing) (wind whistling) Hey Bo. Hey is that you making all that noise? Hey Polly, you okay? Take it easy girl, it's okay. Alright you gonna be good now so I can go back inside? (gasps) - Hi. - Get away from me. - I didn't mean for you to see me like this. - I think I'm gonna faint. - No don't. Sorry I didn't mean to scare you. - You're not real, you're in my head, you're not here. - Please I need you. - Don't come any closer. - Lori, Lori. (dramatic music) - Stay away from me, stay away from me. - Lori. - Stay away. - Easy, I'm not gonna hurt you, Lori please. (dramatic music) come on. Easy. Lori, Lori please stop. Hey listen to me. You don't have to be afraid of me. - I'm not afraid of you. I'm crying because now I know that I'm crazy and they'll probably put me away somewhere. - But you're not crazy. - Don't tell me I'm not crazy. I mean you're dead and I'm talking to, and if I'm talking to you and you're dead that must mean that, missed you Terry. - I've missed you to. I don't know, I guess I am dead. But Lori I am real. I mean I'm here. I don't know, I can't explain it. - Are you a ghost? - I guess I am. - Don't you know? - Nobody said one way or the other. - Who have you asked? - There's nobody I can ask. You're the only one that can see me. I think my mom felt a presence but I don't know. - You went home? How did you get there? - Well I didn't just pop up there. I haven't learned any of those neat ghost tricks yet. I rode home with my folks when they left the hospital. - Did you go to your. Did you go to your own funeral. - Yeah very depressing. - Sorry, I know it's not funny. - No it's not. But anyway I don't know. It's to sad to stick around home and well I figured that there's gotta be a reason that nobody can see me but you. So I came back here. - How did you get here? - By bus. I didn't have to pay. (chuckles) - Well the rain stopped. - Wanna get a bite, I think Max is still open. - I think I better go home. - We could go to my place. - Next time okay? - Betty what's wrong? - Nothing. Just had this feeling that I should be home with Lori that's all. - [Terry] So anyhow I think I've got it figured out. - [Lori] What? - [Terry] Well I haven't run into any other ghosts so there must not be to many around. That makes me kinda special. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. See if I'm still here instead of wherever dead people go then there's gotta be a reason. - Like what? - Like well maybe I've got some sort of mission. - A mission? What kind of mission? - I don't know, but I figured since you're the only person who can see me it's gotta have something to do with you. - It does have something to do with me. You're here to help me. - How do you figure that. - Well see the day I met you I prayed on my fathers grave for help. - Help to do what? (laughing) - You want something to drink, a night cap, coffee? - What ya got? - Something special, team Rhia. - Tina who? (laughs) - I don't think I wanna interfere with somebody else life, even if that is what I'm here for. - But that's gotta be why you're here. I mean can you think of any other reason? - No, but keeping your mom from marrying some guy she loves, it doesn't sound like a real good reason either. Anyway you told me Alec was a nice guy. - He is. Or he was until he started trying to take my dads place. - Your dads dead. - Well so are you. And he wouldn't have sent you if he didn't think I was right. - You don't have to close this door on my account. I've got x-ray vision. - To another evening with you. - You what? - I've got x-ray vision, I can see through anything. - Clothes? Doors? - Anything. - Well then get out of here! (slams) - What the hell was that? - Wait here. - I keep telling you Lori it's gonna do no good to hide. - [Lori] You creep I said get out of here! - But where can I go, what can I do? - [Lori] You can go to hell for all I care, but. (screams) - For gods sake Lori, what's wrong? - You know you really cooked my goose. - What do you mean? - Don't you look at me. Don't ever look at me. - Look Lori I don't understand. - My mother thinks I'm crazy, where did you sleep last night? That's what I thought, don't you look at me. You know you forgot to make the bed, my mother was freaking out this morning, she'll think the place is haunted. It is haunted isn't it? Don't look at me. - Hey slide over. - No. - Okay I'll sit by the window. - I said no. Go sit someplace else. - I wanna sit here and I'm going to sit here. - Georgina, I really feel sick, please just let me lie here okay. - Sure Lori, sure. - Hey this is fun. - Just don't look at me. - Oh this is ridiculous. I can't spend the rest of my life, I mean how can we be together all the time and me not look at you? - You're right, if we're gonna work together we can't have any secrets from each other. We'll be just like Adam and Eve. - You can keep the Adam part out of it. - You're such a male chauvinist. - That's right, and proud of it. - That's disgusting. Wow. God they're such a beautiful ride. - You'll never know how beautiful it was. - What do you mean I'll never know how beautiful was. - Well with my x-ray vision you sorta look like lady cadaver. (gentle music) - Terry what's it like to be dead. - It's like, it's like how you feel when you have nothing to look forward to. - Well there's always tomorrow. - Yeah, you have some idea of what it's gonna be like? But I don't. When I was alive I always felt that there was a reason for my being. I didn't know what it was but I looked forward to finding out, kind of exploring life. Making mistakes, learning, being loved, loving. Now I don't know I feel like I'm just hanging and as far as I can see there isn't any future. - If that's what being dead is then I must be dead to. Because that's exactly how I feel. I mean just living makes dying look so easy. - You don't mean that. Lori, dying is a lot more than what I said. - What else? - Well it could mean my being stuck here. I don't mean here with you, I mean here on earth. - I don't see what's wrong with that. - I can't even have a big Mac you see they won't serve ya if you're not breathing. And I feel small. And unimportant. And afraid. - You have me. I mean I'm better than I big Mac. Hello? Reverend Bart? Is Paul there? This is Lori Anderson. I'm fine how are you? Okay, he's coming. Hi Paul? How are you? I'm fine listen I was wondering what you were doing on Saturday. - Who are you talking to. - Hang on a sec. Paul Bart, he might come up this weekend. - Oh well that would be nice of you. Listen Alec is waiting for me don't you stay up to late. - In other words don't wait up for you? - You've got the right idea. - Yeah I'm sorry Paul. Listen do you wanna come up this weekend? - I'm sorry I just can't, not tonight. - Well you certainly picked a fine time to discover you have a headache. - I said that I was sorry. Look can we go now? - Well yeah if that's what you want. I rather you tell me what's wrong, maybe I can help. - Okay. I can. I wanted us to be married just a soon as possible. - What? - I am not gonna let that child steam roller me any longer. - She must have said something nasty again. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well when you agree to a wedding date I want it to be for the right reasons. - The sooner the better. - Well I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. - I'll call reverend Holt tomorrow, but not first thing that way you can call me after you cool down just in case you change your mind. - Alec, I've known for a long time that I was gonna have to make a choice. And I am making it. I love you. And Lori's just gonna have to learn to live with that.

Stop. - Stop what? - I have a confession to make. - What? - I don't have x-ray vision. - You what? - I don't have x-ray vision, it was a joke. - Well I don't know how to tell you this Mr. Stockton but your little joke just backfired on you. - What do you mean? - I mean I'm mad. And when I get like that you're not gonna know how or when or where, but you can be sure of one thing. I'm gonna get you for this Terry. - Oh man you country folk sure to eat right. (laughing) - Well you're welcome to thirds. - Seconds are enough, please don't tempt me. (knocking) - It's open. Hey. - Hello everybody. - What is this a raid, did I eat to many pancakes. (laughs) - Paul Bart, Alec Peiski. - Hey I know you. - I know you. Except the last time I saw you you were a little out of focus. - Yeah well, you recovering okay? - [Paul] Pretty well. - Great, Betty could I speak to you of a minute. - Yeah, sure, sure, you kids excuse us for a sec. - He seems a nice enough guy. For a cop. - Yeah I guess he's okay. - Lori you didn't ask me up here just because of my good looks. There was a reason behind that phone call wasn't there? - Yeah there's someone here that wants to see you. - I'm almost afraid to ask who. - [Betty] Lori you come in here for a sec, Alec and I have something to tell you. - Excuse me. - Look you knew this was coming. Try to think of your mom instead of yourself. He's a nice guy. She's still young. Lori that's life. That's the beauty of life, it goes on. - I do like Alec and I want my mom to be with a man. But I don't want a new father and it's disgusting she wants a new husband. - Lori she'll never stop loving your dad. But loving someone who's gone, that isn't very satisfying. I think it's important that she's making a commitment. - I don't understand. - I don't have all the answers. But the way I see it your mom spent a lot of time grieving. Just thinking about what used to be. Life was kinda just passing her by. But now, now she wants to make a commitment to live again. That should make you happy. - You know you talk like some big expert but you don't know what it's like having somebody taken away from you. - Really? I thought we had this conversation the other day. I guess I was just talking to myself. Look if you want me I'll be down at the Mcdonalds sniffing the big Macs. - Wait Terry I'm sorry. Maybe you're right, I don't know. But that's the way I feel and I don't know what to do because I can't help the way I feel. - Living isn't easy. But it beats the hell out of anything else I know. - My father doesn't want his, he doesn't want her to get married. - You don't know that. - But he sent you. - You don't know that either. - God I'm so unhappy. I just want it to be like it was. I wanna feel happy again. - You gotta feel happy about yourself first. - Tell me what to do. - I don't think I have to tell you. (dramatic music) - Terry? Terry. Terry are you here? If you are just don't jump out or anything, I couldn't take it. Well I'll be seeing you later. Boy they'll be locking me up soon. So this is it huh? - Come on don't make it look so grim. - I'm sorry I lost my head. So what do we do now? - This was Terry's idea, it wasn't mine. - Where is Terry? - He's right there. - Well if he moves or anything you let me know, I'd hate to step on him. (chuckles) - Come on Paul, please be serious. Terry says that you can help us. - If I can't see, I can't help. - First you have to be really convinced that Terry is here and that I'm not crazy. - I never make snap judgments. - Kay you ready? - Yeah. - Kay. Terry wants you to ask me some questions that I couldn't possibly know the answers to but he would. - Like what was our second grade teachers name? - Ellen Hathaway. - Ellen Hathaway. - What was my grandmothers first name? - He's having trouble with that, could you hold on a second? What? - Give me another question. - Could you give him another question? - Right, okay. What did we do the last time that we double dated? - I'd rather not say. - He'd rather not, what do you mean you'd rather not say, what exactly, what did you do Mr. Stockton? Is that so? And I guess you'd like me to believe that wouldn't you? I suppose she was a blonde? - [Paul] Lori, excuse me. - Just stay out of this Paul, oh and your grandmothers first name is Mildred. - I believe, I believe! (dramatic music) Well why didn't he do something like that in the first place? - He was going to but when you came into my bedroom this afternoon so scared, he thought maybe he oughta work up to the heavy stuff. - He's not in? - No he's right there. - He. So he. He was there when I was talking to him before in your room, he. Well he must have had a laugh on me. - Tell him want him to take some notes. - He'd like you to take some notes. - [Terry] You and I are gonna tell him our whole story from the moment we met. Every word we can remember. - But why? - Because I wanna try and figure out why I'm here. What I'm supposed to be doing. - [Lori] But how is he gonna be any better at figuring out our problem than we are? Alright, um. Once you've heard our story he'd like you to go and tell your father. Ask him his advice. - What about Terry's folks, shouldn't I tell them? - No! No, I'm dead to them let me stay dead. - He says no. (engine rumbling) (bells rings) - Hi Gale. - She'll be out in a out Alec. - Oh not in her gown. I don't want any bad luck. - Come on now, you don't believe in those old wives tales do you. - I love you. (bell rings) - Mom, you're so beautiful. I'm so happy for you. (yodeling) - Do you need any help mom? - Oh no thanks honey. - Okay well I'm gonna go to bed then. - Okay. - Good night. (yodeling) Hey I thought ghosts didn't need to take showers? - I don't know that they do, I just thought that do give it a try. It sure feels good. (yodeling) (upbeat music) (yodeling) (mischievous music) - Peek a boo! (yelling) (upbeat music) I told you I'd get you! - [Terry] Wait till I get my hands on you you little sneak! Oh I can't believe you did that. (thuds) (upbeat music) Say you're sorry. - Never because I'm not! You deserved every single ice cube. - [Terry] Come on say it, say it! - No, no! Hi mom, I was just gonna wash my hair. - What the hell is going on in here? - Well you see I must have tripped and I hit the chair and then the chair must have hit the table and it was like domino's and. Oh there was this big gust of wind that came through here also. (gentle music) - What is it? - I'm sorry, you know about the ice water. - I guess I deserved it. - Well I guess we don't have anymore secrets. Do we Adam? - Well I don't anyhow. - Do you wanna sleep on the bed? - Yes. - But you won't will you. - No. You understand that don't you? - You want me to hang on to life and you're not part of it. That's what you think right? - Yeah that's it. - But you're part of my life. - Yeah but I shouldn't be. It's a fluke. It's a crazy joke. - Can I lie here next to you. - No. - Why, nothing could happen your a ghost. - Go to bed. Anyway you'll look kinda funny walking around with transparent children. (wedding march) - Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and this woman in holy matrimony. The union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind is intended by God for their mutual joy. For the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity, and when it is gods will, for the procreation of children and their nurture in the knowledge and love of the Lord. Therefore marriage is not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly. But reverently, deliberately, and in accordance for the purposes for which it was instituted by God. (ringing) - Still no answer? - No. - Look son the things are told you are pure conjunction. - But if what you say is right then I gotta get a hold of Lori. - If what I said is right, it's the last thing you should do. - In the name of God I Alec take you Betty. - In the name of God I Alec take you Betty. - To be my wife. - To be my wife. - To have and to hold from this day forward. (ringing) (gentle music) (ringing) (ringing) (wind whistling) - [Reverend] To love and to cherish until. - [Alec] To love and to cherish. - In the name of God I Betty take you Alec to be my husband. - In the name of God I Betty take you Alec to be my husband. - [Reverend] To have and to hold from this day forward. - To have and to hold from this day forward. - [Reverend] For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. - [Betty] For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. - [Reverend] In sickness and in health. - In sickness and in health. - To love and to cherish until we are parted by death. (ringing) (dramatic music) - Till we are parted by death. - [Reverend] Alec I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow. - [Betty] Alec I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow. - [Reverend] All that I am. (wind whistling) (wind whistling) (ringing) - I honor you in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. - [Reverend] Betty I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow. (ringing) (dramatic music) - I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow. - [Reverend] Alec and Betty have given themselves to each other by solid vows for the joining of hands and the giving of rings, I pronounce that they are husband and wife. (dramatic music) (ringing) Those who God has joined together, let no man put asunder. (ringing) (dramatic music) (chattering) (Wedding music) (dramatic music) - Terry! Terry? Terry! Terry where are you! Oh God. Terry? Terry! Terry? Oh Terry. (dramatic music) (ringing) Hello? - Lori? Hi I think my dad has this thing figured out. My dad thinks that Terry was sent here to help you. The way he put it was to help you get on with your life. And to make you understand it was right for you mother to get on with hers. To marry someone that she loved and that loved her. Lori there's something else. My dad thinks that now that that's done Terry can go on to his rest. That's the way he put it. Terry can go to his. Lori hello? Lori? (hooves clattering) - Help me. (hooves clattering) (dramatic music) - Terry? Terry you here? (dramatic music) Terry please don't leave me. (dramatic music) (neighing) (beeping) - Doctor, come quickly. (beeping) - Charge the panels. Let have the bicarb. (beeping) (dramatic music) - Hi. - I thought I'd lost you. - I don't think you could lose me if you tried. I'll always be around somewhere. - You didn't get to where you're supposed to go to then? - Oh yeah I did. That's what I wanna talk to you about. See that's where you ware now. And you're not supposed to be. Not yet anyway. - You mean I'm dead. - For the moment. - That's wonderful. - No it's not. Now listen to me because we don't have much time to talk. - All I want is to be with you Terry. I love you. - There's so much more in store for you than that. We'll meet again and we'll be friends, that'll come. But Lori they're will be others for you to love. A husband, children, grand children. - I want you. - That can never be. - I'm dead and I'm staying dead, that's what I wanted. I won't let them bring me back. - If I loved you just a little bit I'd take you with me. - You don't love me? - I love you too much. You're going to have what I couldn't. Life. And if you really love me you'll live it for all it's worth. - I do love you but I can't live without you. - No you're wrong. That's the great thing about life, it goes on, it's a gift. And never of ones own choosing. This time it's from me to you. Do you remember what your father wrote in his journal? - Yes. - Say it for me. - The ultimate secret of life is the sure knowledge of death, for without it man would not strive to leave his mark upon the earth. - Love me enough to love life, to leave your mark. - I do love you. (gentle music) (gasps) - [Doctor] She's alive, thank God. - Doctor Alai, I was wondering how the little Anderson girl is, my daughters a class mate of hers. - Fine, just fine. - Oh good I'm glad, Sandy will be thrilled. - Got a minute? - Sure I'm on my break. - Let me show you something. - What is it?
