Cha is not an easy man lt won't hurt to be prepared What's on tonight's agenda? The presidential pardon, sir We advise you to reconsider l don't think it's an issue of personal forgiveness The nation and our recent history isn't ready to forgive them Moreover, there is the outstanding issue of an unaccounted-for slush fund The public sentiment remains strong You might take the fall for your generosity What are your thoughts, Minister? Do you think l'm going over the line, too? l was the chiefjustice for the case They were tried as former Presidents and there was huge pressure But, be it death penalty or life imprisonment Sentencing them was only possible because the public approved l believe you should approach this issue from that perspective l'm the President of this country A special pardon is the President's right under the Constitution Am l mistaken? No, it's not unlawful, sir What's all that? l have a big presentation at the seminar Couldn't you have gotten a cab? Why spend money on a cab? This car was given to me for official duty not for picking up husbands All right, all right... Take the presidential pardon for instance... Would it have been possible earlier in his tenure? We're dancing around the same topic Let's not distort his good intentions The current President was persecuted by the military government - Turn up the volume, please? - Yes, ma'am ln other words, he was the biggest victim Why would he want to do this? To fulfill one of this government's greatest objectives-to unite the nation What about the slush fund? Please approach the subject more logically Please let me speak... We deeply regret that, too lt's up to the judiciary bodies to investigate the matter fully But, how do you expect the justice department to do a properjob When the government is clearly lacking the will Are you accusing us of undermining the principles of division of powers? ln this day and age? What's the point of convicting and sentencing them to life in prison when they are let off right away? What's the point of giving them the death penalty, only to free them after a year and a half?. lt was 2 years Get your facts right lt was 20 months to be precise! How are you? lt's been a long time How have you been, sir?

Study was my only focus l can get the NlS to look into it Don't lie to me l can't believe this You would use the agency's service for personal reasons? Do you know what year we're living in? That would call for impeachment Hey This one... the Capital Administration Bill Let me have it What do you mean let you have it?! l shouldn't have come by myself The meeting... lt went very well Although we didn't manage to go over all outstanding bills But, we had umm... better results than initially anticipated l'm a little exhausted from the marathon meeting Forgive me for telling you this in a letter Honey, come and watch this Mimi dies tonight They still don't know that they have the same father?

We should have made him change his schedule Why can't you take it easy like other retiring Presidents? You'll end up in the national cemetery before the lnauguration He's not eating as usual... Take more care! That's weird... l put extra care For the purpose of improving the national brand of Korea, it'll be imperative to allocate the extra budget funds and resources required for updating the system And, of course... Look at him He seems to be out of it Yesterday, l caught him chuckling to himseIf Maybe... something happened... when he collapsed What do you mean by that? You know... the thing that happens to old people... that makes you lose your mind By providing training programs and educational literature for the tourism sector, and attracting fluent speakers of foreign languages...

Mr. President has won the lottery! Manager, bring out his money! Security, escort him, now! Everyone, Mr. President has won the lottery! No, no... l can't go there myself Everybody knows who she is Should l send the Chief of Staff?. No, he'll do a runner, the moment he collects the money What are you stressing about? lt's not a crime for a President to win the lottery! You're a citizen the same as anyone else l am, right? You said you'd donate it all to a good cause You gave your word lt's always the mouth! You can always take it back lt's natural for a politician to change his mind You have a point Everything you stood for and the integrity of your government will go down the drain Give up the money But, it's 24 billion Won 20- what?! Why didn't you tell me earlier? What's there to think about? Just eat dirt and take the money! 24 billion? Man... l had no idea! Staying up late? l'll sleep on the plane tomorrow You have to go back so soon? l'll be back for good, next year ls there anything you need? Are you short of money? The collapse must have hurt you somehow ls it funny that l talk about money? Can l take this? lt's my favorite picture lt was the hard times l was constantly on the run or imprisoned for political reasons l was never able to pay your tuition You were always an easy target Ji-wook's father never got caught even if he was with you all the time That's because he backed out at all the critical moments On the day l arrived l saw Ji-wook at the hospital He hasn't changed a bit He is just as stubborn as his old man Do you want to see him? Pardon? No, why would l? l'll get some sleep You boys are dead 'cuz this round is mine! Don't mind me and go ahead Chef Jang, do we have some soju? l'm not sure if it's okay to drink, sir You only just got out of the hospital Have a drink No, sir... Oh, thank you Who was winning? No one... We were just playing to kill time but l was about to win big when you came in lt was a double round l don't know the rules Of course! Looking back at life, l've never had fun Why would you think that? Suppose, one day, a ton of money fell out of sky Pardon? Say, while you're going your way about 20 billion Won fell on you from out of nowhere and no one knows about it because it was a quiet alley What would you do? lf that much money fell on me l would die What? lf that sort of money fell on me from the sky it would break my neck the moment it hit lt would kill most people on the spot Even if you survived... there's no one around to help you So, you'd probably die after a few painful minutes You're right That's what would happen lf money fell on you from the sky You'd die without getting any help Because there is no one around That's the right answer ''You die'' Therefore, it is our duty and privilege to keep with the proud and noble beliefs of the patriotic martyrs l sincerely ask you to understand and approve the decision that l and this government have made regarding the lndependences Day special pardons of the two former Presidents We must end the vicious circle of conflict rooted in political and geographical differences We must unite in peace and work together for a better tomorrow l believe today's decision will mark the beginning of a triumphant new chapter That was the end of the speech l prepared for today But, l have another short announcement to make Remain in positions Not long ago, there was a launch of a new sports lottery Everyone at the event including myself, took part by entering This isn't part of a report on operations But, l'll make an honest confession before you all today l won the jackpot The winning numbers 6, 8, 0, 2, 1 , 9 lt's the date l proposed to my wife The jackpot amount is 24.4 billion Won 24.4 billion... lt's the kind of money that l would never even dream about l've decided to donate the prize money to a scholarship foundation to help less fortunate youngsters with their studies l've never lived as a rich man So, l lack ideas as to how to spend this money wisely lf my decision, which l believe to be the only right one, can help young people build their dreams, lt'll be my greatestjoy And, if l may add... lf there is anyone among my predecessors who has money that doesn't rightly belong to them How about spending it on a good cause? Just my thought l'm sorry l didn't tell you earlier Have you lost your mind? l mean that money... Good Gracious! Couldn't you have kept a half, at least? l'm at a loss for words! - Honey, l... - Oh, forget it! And, you proposed to me in March, not February Was it? l'm sure it was February Have you ever seen cherry blossoms in February? You're right lt was during the blossom season So, it was March Honey, should l recant and say that l want to keep the money? And, be a national laughing stock? l could say l'll keep the money and give up the pension Can you not talk for a moment, Mr. President? l do solemnly swear that l will faithfully execute the Office of President of the Republic of Korea and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Korea President of Republic of Korea, Cha Ji-wook When did it start exactly? The initial detection was made at 21 :00 by the Combined Forces Command and we received the report at 23:05 How come we are the last to know about tensions taking place in our waters Maritime command is still in the hands of Pacific Command, sir Mr. President, it's the White House Any chance they'll give us time? Very slim, sir Not even a little? We're connected, sir Ah~ good morning Mr. President. l'm sorry but it's nighttime, here Oh shit! l forgot l just received the report Of course, hours later than you We will be having an NSA meeting ln a few hours and of course our conclusion will be reacting strongly against it. If congress approves, we will be moving our 7th fleet Shouldn't we think about the cause first? Pardon? Japan has moved their missile base to the Northwest to protect the trajectory And in the name of training, they have focused their Maritime Force on North Korea and in our territorial waters As you know, without prior consent from the concerning countries a military activity of this kind can be deemed an act of provocation Japan would've anticipated this reaction Don't you think it's weird that Japan is knowingly creating tension? We don't have time to think about these things... Mr. President This is not a political plan but a military conflict. by all means, when congress approves, the Republic of Korea will have to open up both air space and its territorial waters... According to the plan... lf the Pacific Command enters our air and waters, then, so will the Japanese Self-Defense Force, right? Be rational about this... Give us til the end of the week ''Opinion poll: 2 out of 3 disapprove of President's hard-line foreign policy'' Tension could lead to war? We demanded the Japanese clear out by an official letter ln a worst case scenario, you should be prepared to get China involved The simplest solution would be to convince North Korea lf they withdraw, we can untangle this problem A more urgent issue at hand is the upcoming general election You should really pay more attention Approval ratings dropped again? Water, please? Diplomatic tension with Japan is creating unrest among the public And, the party is grieving about the lack of support on your part So...? Are you asking me to put on a show or something for ratings? You should take this seriously Things are not looking good We cannot afford to lose to the Opposition What do l have to do to get some water here?! We have a meeting with the Japanese Ambassador We are... very regretful that the Korean government... isn't actively dealing with the recent episode... of provocation by the North Korean military You seem to be mistaken l have summoned you here, Ambassador! Not for your opinion or a chit-chat, but to tell you that the current tensions were triggered by Japan's military action Do you understand? But, it's a... legitimate... Please speak in Japanese You have a translator Wouldn't it be easier? Why sweat it? - Just speak in Japanese - Should l go home? Oh, l'm sorry This training was - a legitimate military activity - Take a seat We never violated foreign territories and acted under approval from the Pacific Command Do you take me for an idiot?! Look at me, Ambassador! The Maritime Force intruded into our waters 3 times while relocating to the northwest and the standoff area is conventionally prohibited from military activities You know that, don't you? This is not military training but a military action and it's a natural reaction for North Korea which works in favor of your government Because such military tension will raise concerns for national security and stirred-up public sentiment will pave the way for legislation of the New National Security Law that the right wing government always wanted. lsn't that so? What's the matter? Lost for words? l'm so sorry but you spoke too fast... Don't take the Korean government for a fool We may have a humiliating history but we don't do humiliating politics We'd better wrap it up for today Could you put the blind up? Thank you! lt's my second time in Seoul The night view was spectacular with all the bright lights on bridges and buildings l'm flattered. Thank you Why would you be? lt's not like you built them North Korea must withdraw by the end of the week You cannot take an emotional approach with Japan Because that's what they want They want to make an issue out of the current crisis We're telling them to stay out of our waters telling them to stop pointing missiles at our country ln case they're having wild ideas about our people again, we're telling them we're pissed off and that we won't blankly stare like the Americans or the South Koreans Are you saying you're prepared to go war? Who are you? l'm the Chief of National lntelligence But then, when you dropped a missile in Japanese waters or pressed on with plans to launch satellites, the surrounding countries passed over in silence Because we wanted to prevent war, at all costs And, you are...? l'm the Secretary of National Security Did you invite me over to gang up on me? What do you mean gang up on you? Listen! lt was the same back in '94 and '08 when the Americans pushed us over We have never changed our position because we're not Afghans playing with popguns in caves Or some tiny banana republic in Africa or Central America that sprouts up and disappears Are you scared of war, Mr. President? There are three things in the world that l'm scared of First is needles Second is when my little son raises his hand with a question And the last is... candlelight vigils A War? We'll go to war if it's necessary But, now is not the time Now, you have to trust us No, trust me, Cha Ji-wook l'll prove to you that a solid government and good politicians are stronger than a million troops My beloved people of Korea... Han Kyung-ja, the former Minister of Law She's a good card She could be a breath of fresh air temporarily But, are we ready for a female president? A publicity stunt for the election, clearly You think so? Why am l going to the market? To get a sense of public sentiment l would like to thank - my fellow candidates - Hang on... That woman there... lt's Professor Kim E-yeon, daughter of the former President Kim She was scouted as the counsel for foreign policy They seem to be a good match Do you know her? What? Not really... Our fathers were friends She could have come on the scene earlier But, she kept a low profile until her father's term ended Smart... really She's also the spokesperson Really? Well, anything sounds better when it comes out of a beauty But, too hasty Shouldn't we send some congratulatory flowers for Ms. Han? l already have, sir Good for you Do you think l should send something for Professor Kim, too? What do you think? l have that arranged, too l'll be back later, sir 3pm: Visit to Moonsan Market Are you all right? ls this really necessary? lt's the easiest and surest way You believe what you see l should be making policy for people Eating rice cake in the market won't make any changes Rice cake? That's a good idea Why didn't l think of that? Rice cake... and, throw in some fish balls and sausages lt'll make it all the more realistic if you actually eat something This is really good! Hello, big fella! Mr. President! Mr. President! Please save my father! He needs your kidney! Please look at me, sir! Mr. President!! He needs your kidney The events of this afternoon is an example of the misguided belief widely spread in our society that things can be achieved with a loud voice Foreign press have reported today's incident as an act of a mentally deranged man The President was safe however and according to the police lnvestigation, the young man is 22 years old... According to eyewitness accounts, ''showing fundamental problems'' with presidential security ''showing fundamental problems'' the President threw himself to the ground the President threw himself to the ground before his guards surrounded him lf what the attacker pulled out of his jacket was not a banner but a gun, we could have lost the most agile President in history That crazy bastard! How can he be so quick? l'll get axed for this, right? - Vice Chief! - Sir Congratulations, man! Don't say that, sir Regarding today's incident, wrap it up as swiftly as possible A reprimand of some sort for security will be unavoidable lt's become a bit of an issue lt's late Let's get some rest l'm tired Sir! lt wouldn't hurt to consider it Excuse me? The transplant, sir Mr. Moon! Now the entire country knows it A young man begged the President to save his father and only the President can save him What would the public think? l'm not telling you to go through with an operation Just the gesture The President was willing to help but due to medical complications... We'll get the message across How's that? lt's a perfect idea The media is not on our side lf we pull this off, it could turn the situation around completely What the public wants to see is the humane side of the President Mr. Moon Young-cheol! l'll go by myself Come on, Ji-wook! l'm asking you as a friend Politics is a show That's what we learned Let's put on a show, just once Mr. President Your name is Kim Joo-joong? Yes, sir How old are you? Twenty... Twenty two, sir A student? Yes No, actually... l'm on leave of absence Don't be terrified l'm not here to punish you l just wanted to talk to you There's been some drama in my life recently This was by far the best Was it you? l'm sorry, sir! lt happens when l'm nervous Sorry That's okay lt's a physiological reaction So, your father is very... My father passed away when l was about your age Mr. Cha Myung-soo MP, right? Not many young people know about him l read his memoir... and saw a documentary on him, too There was a lot of talk about you That you were a crybaby as a child, about the mole on the bottom, and two vortices on your scalp You found out about my blood type and that l have a rare tissue type Yes, l learned all that from the book Well, l came here to apologize lt's not final but matching blood type and DNA tissue... doesn't mean l qualify as a donor Also, being President of a country... it's not my personal decision But, you achieved so many things by fighting opposition and proved that your belief was right Sit down, young man Mr. President, please! He doesn't have much time Please... l beg you l'm really sorry Was there really no alternative to me? There is nothing more that l can do Book me in Pardon? For a tissue compatibility test Yes, sir! The chance of a match is miniscule The test will be it Hello Pardon me?! At 1930, a plan of operation was served By 0800 tomorrow, a regiment from the 7th fleet will pass the East Sea and reach the standoff point located at 220km off the Northeast Sea Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force is included in the regiment? That's right This is the standoff point lt's in international waters 120 km from our territorial waters North Korea dispatched 1 Najin-class commodore, 3 Yugo-class frigates, and a maritime sniper brigade Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force has mobilized the 3rd Maizuru convoy and have the 4th and 8th covoy on standby Why is Korea so small on the map? Pardon me? l mean on that map... lsn't it actually bigger than that? l'll correct that, sir lf we don't open up our waters, what happens next? The White House will call and play the wartime command card l'll tell them the current situation isn't critical. And, then? Following more discussions... You'll buy some time Three days left, right? lf we prove to the North Koreans that they can trust us, we can have them withdraw within 3 days We must carefully weigh the gains and losses The American President and the Republicans won't be happy but we can prevent a war Also, we can stop the legislation of Japan's New Self-Defense Law and improve our relationship with the North Much more to gain than to lose No... Everything is okay What do you mean a war will break out? Test results are already in? Couldn't they wait a few more days? Anything l need to know? What?! Full House l can make some noodles if you give me a few minutes That's okay l felt like instant noodles This kimchi is amazing You made it yourself? Usually, l do But, we ordered ready-made this time - Right... - l'm sorry My son woke up in the middle of the night and asked me a question He says he's in love with someone but doesn't know what to do Kids these days are unbelievable So, what did you tell him? So, l told him... lf you really love that person love your daddy first, then, she'll love you, too That doesn't make sense lt doesn't, does it? - Use this - Thank you l don't remember exactly but l think l had a similar conversation with my father lf you really love someone... No, that's not what he said lf you really want to love and save this country, Look after the hungry kid next door, first l read it in his memoir How did l reply to that? l'm not sure but l don't think it had what you said after, in the book Look after the hungry kid next door, first One time, an old man came to me and asked me lf, while you were busy running around trying to make a better country, your neighbor's child dies of starvation Have you really saved the country? You're right l think that's what he said So, if you really love your mum and dad, you must love a friend who's in a less fortunate situation lf you do, it's same as loving your own mum and dad and loving this country Thank you for the ramen Did you have to come up with the crazy idea, at this crucial time? Look at the mess you made The idea was to make a gesture l honestly didn't expect this result Do you know how scared he is of needles? Mr. President is here l believe this morning's unscheduled statement gave rise to concerns and questions for fellow Koreans watching this program Early this morning, this government made a decision to turn down the U.S.'s request for military cooperation The decision is consistent with our principles of prioritizing national security and maintaining seIf-reliant peace in Asia lt is also a manifestation of our will to solidify trust with North Korea Despite the grave importance of this matter, time was of the essence in reaching a decision which will be reviewed by the Assembly later Today's decision which entails the risk of diplomatic friction with the U.S. is a manifestation of our concern over the military expansion of Japan l would like to ask for your understanding on another decision l made Two days ago, a young man came to me to save his father He believed that only l could save the life of his father and that wasn't far from the truth l would like to announce to my fellow Koreans and my loyal staff, a decision l believe to be the best l could reach has been made ln a few hours, l will undergo an operation to transplant one of my kidneys to the man who shares the same rare tissue structure as me, who is teetering on the verge of life and death During the six-hour operation and the following few days of recovery, the entire cabinet will do their best to ensure the smooth running of state affairs lt is my belief that if l can't save the life of one man who needs my help, l cannot be the President for millions Will l need general anesthesia for the procedure? How is it done? Through oral administration? lt's usually administered by injection l see... well... Let's get rolling lt's the first time, sir Letting you be in a dangerous place without my escort You're sharing a life with me Please live your half of our life to the fullest, for me lf you love your mum and dad,... But, it's E-yeon that l love What should l do? You mean, Jung-ho's daughter E-yeon? Why do you like her? You want me to tell her for you? No! E-yeon! Stop it, dad! - Ji-wook is in love with you! - Don't! How did it go? The North Koreans withdrew their troops and, agreed to accept our terms of negotiation with Japan No, l mean the transplant Was it successful? We would like to express our support for the government's diplomatic decision... The government shall need to discuss the potential diplomatic friction and other related issues on a pan-national level Also, we'd like to express our utmost respect for the President's noble decision and, wish a fast recovery l made some porridge with scallops lt's not seasoned so, if it's too bland... Chef! You know when my father told me to look after a hungry kid next door l remembered how l replied Sir? l told him... there was no next door to us Enjoy your meal, sir The ratings are soaring in our favor lt rose by almost 10% and, the party's overall rating by 5% By the way, you don't really need to worry about this but... there's a man at the Hangang Bridge causing a fuss asking for a liver transplant from you which is totally absurd, of course! But then, if you gave away that, too You could probably change the Constitution Besides, you're still young and fit Mr. President! Come on, man!

We are covered for everything? Well, the Assembly... The Opposition's resistance is stronger than anticipated Tax hikes are always a sensitive issue There is even a talk of red-baiting Raising taxes automatically makes us a left wing government?

They just call random numbers ''No interest for the first month,'' right? l got similar calls a few times What an annoying bunch! That's not the point of this! You lied to me! Are you a spy? No one else carries private cell phones in the Blue House l'm sorry But, l have a personal life outside of my duty l normally have it switched off and only use it in special cases... l got rid of it What? l got rid of the phone Good for you... l still have 6 months on the contract but, never mind - Hello! - Look, who's here! How are you? Good. He's grown so big Have you been busy? Not so much You drove here by yourself? l haven't done it in years... lt was great Why didn't you take the residence that government provided? l'm grateful for the pension Why waste money on building a new house? You're so stubborn How's the preparation for the policy institute going? l decided to put it on hold for now lt's only been a year since the handover lt could be a little too soon l'm thinking of continuing with my studies lt's good to hear that l was worried you might open a gym How's life as a single dad? lsn't this...? Chef Jang has them sent over every now and then ln the name of providing good education, parents go through tough competitions... What's with her hair? Why do women in politics have that same bouffant hairdo? A bright red suit? Like a firefighter Her skin looks great Well, she gets the best facials They have beauticians in the Residence? Yeah... l got one every other day How come l never got one? Maybe it was new from my term Well, l got them What?! That wretched Chief of Staff... Can we watch some TV? You don't care now that your terms are over? Shame on you The Special Administrative City Law that this government wants to enact entails moving the capital into... ls he sure? He doesn't talk rubbish lf this is true, she's headed directly for impeachment Have they lost their minds? You know l'm the best hit man in the Opposition Let's strike while the iron is hot We can get this in tomorrow's morning editions lsn't it her birthday, tomorrow? Happy birthday, Madam President!

Have you lost your mind?!! Han Gate: the Special Admin City Law, a present for husband? The President's ambitious plans for relocation of the capital, was it all but a part of her real estate speculation scheme? This is the true face of Han's government lt's beyond outrageous How can we trust a government under corrupt leadership ls it worth keeping this government? We must put it to the people l really didn't know! All l wanted was to raise pigs and cows there when we retire What are they building there?! God damn it! Where is she? At the Residence, sir What's going to happen now? The Opposition will initiate a motion for impeachment at the Assembly... Where is he? Mr. Choi went out for some air Do l need to go through with this? You must act as normally as possible especially at times like this lf you don't, they will bite down harder on us Like in a dog fight lt's not all that exciting to celebrate a birthday, at my age l would like to thank all of you who came to congratulate me and apologize for what you must've heard on the news this morning lt was a nasty surprise for me, too As the President, l feel that l am solely responsible for what happened Today, my husband was going to dance with me on stage but, he wasn't feeling very well... Ladies and Gentlemen, it's my husband, Choi Chang-myun - Are you okay? - Yeah l'm the presidential spouse, Choi Chang-myun l'm sorry l'm late Today is the birthday of my dear wife and our President lt should have been a day of happiness and celebration but because of me, it was one of the worst days in her life l had a dream of retiring to a farm with my wife So, l bought a small ranch with my life savings l had no idea it would turn out to be such a disaster l just sold off the land Looking back, this wasn't the first time l failed to provide the support she needs for carrying out her duties as President l regret so much only adding to her burdens And, it makes me realize that l probably won't change as a person So, l made a small resolution and, felt l should announce it before l have a change of heart On the way here, l thought of you in the old days and l got choked up You are as beautiful now as you have ever been Kyung-ja... Let's get divorced lt's not possible for me to be with you and live as a presidential spouse What's going on? What did he say? l'm American, too... l'm so sorry And, happy birthday lt's an emergency! A crisis! No, not a crisis either For the first time in the history of Korea, a sitting President may get divorced during her presidential term This afternoon's statement by Professor Choi was his sole decision which he hopes, will allow the President to devote herseIf to her presidential duties Lawyers for Democratic Society has volunteered to represent Professor Choi... Opposition to blame for President's Divorce - 62.4% Lawyers for Democratic Society has volunteered to represent Professor Choi... Opposition to blame for President's Divorce - 62.4% The public points finger of blame at the Opposition... Where is this going? lt's backfiring on us Who did you hit, the President or her husband? Calm down This is an opportunity for us A President with a family crisis! She's as vulnerable as can be Look at the survey results Public reaction is contrary They think we're responsible for the President's divorce Don't you know what she represents to the people? To the public, she's the mother-, wife- and daughter-in-law figure The Mother Mary, Korea's Joan of Arc and Cleopatra... Maybe not the Cleopatra... ls it not? Did l say Cleopatra? The point is... The opposition seems to be worried about taking the blame Has she made up her mind about a divorce? ''President sacrificing her marriage for the sake of her duties''... Not bad Professor Choi has been a ticking time-bomb Maybe she's better off without him Have you ever been through a divorce? No, l'm happily married l went through with it twice When was the second time? The first time was not in the record You think a divorce will allow you to focus better on yourjob? Who should be handling the matter anyway? The personnel affairs? How come? lt goes under political affairs What? Definitely not the foreign policy Leave me out of this How can you let this happen? You know what dad's like! What about me? Are you blaming me for what he has done? But, you know how hard it has been for him Before being one man's wife, l'm the President of this country How can l do my job if l have family troubles to worry about lf he can't put up with it... then, we have no choice Please mother... He started it all Even if he comes back, things won't change for the better Suit yourself, Madam President l loved him with all my heart However, since taking office, l found loving someone as a private person a very difficult task Today, l'm mustering up the courage to make an announcement about a decision l made l decided to remain by myself as your President, not as a wife to a... God, this is corny! What's with the humiliating tone? Am l begging for sympathy for a poor divorcee? What's with ''tears'' in brackets? You want me to cry here? Today, l stand before you as your President, not a wife to a man... Like this? l'm sorry, ma'am. We've never dealt with this kind of situation... Should the President present herself at the court for divorce? For formalities... And other things like alimony... She is praised as the mother figure of the 21st century And now, she's fallen a victim of a political snare thanks to the Opposition Although he claimed an innocent coincidence, he did buy land awaiting major development Please, let's use some common sense here The President's husband bought the land in his own name so that the world will know when he makes a huge profit out of it? A five-year-old would laugh at that Well, he just did that laughable thing Are you listening to what l'm saying? - We'll move on to talk about - lt's not us that's funny - what will happen next - but the way you people think Some claim that the President has made up her mind about the divorce Nothing has been decided Please be careful with the wording Our society places great value on family, which is why the public is so concerned They say ''Cultivate body, order family then, make peace for the world'' People are concerned as to whether or not she'll be able to carry out her duties without the support of a solid family behind her lt's funny you should say that The former President Cha was a wifeless father Did he ever have solid family support behind him? A wifeless father?! Did you just refer to the former President as a ''wifeless father?'' Are you trying to insult the former head of state? What uneducated absurdity? How dare you talk to me like that? How old are you? Why are you asking me my age? We were in the same class in college How old l am is how old you are! l failed my entrance exams twice That's fantastic! Well done for re-taking your exams! You must be really proud! Are you mocking me? You have just insulted the 200,000 students nationwide that are re-taking exams What did l ever say about them? l'm talking about you! Take your words back this moment or l'll see to it that you pay for it l can't and l won't! Make a public apology right this moment! Hey, little guy! No books or TV or talking on the phone while eating your dinner, okay? Hello? This is Cha Ji-wook l hope l'm not interrupting you at a busy time l have a favor to ask Would you be willing to give a lecture for my students? l'll check my schedule This morning, the President invited her two predecessors, the former Presidents Kim and Cha, to a luncheon at the Blue House and discussed the main objectives and pending issues of her government Hello, it's great to meet you! l studied politics at university like yourselves and served as the President until last year in case, some of you didn't know You parted with your wife quite early and served your term without the support of a First Lady l think you might have hopes of meeting someone special again Did you meet that special person during your tenure? That's class A confidentiality Tell us! Tell us! On many occasions, l felt lonely Even if l had the best advisers and was surrounded by people who had faith in me There were times l wanted to be in love again to have that special feeling for someone But, l found that as a President, it's difficult to love one person only lt's a job where it's extremely difficult to love, cherish and respect one person So, l gave it up And now, l regret giving it up so much l had lunch with President Han this afternoon As you know, she is going through a tough time at the moment l told her what l learned from my experience To be President for one person when it comes to a certain moment ln order to avoid having regrets later on You were fantastic today Don't flatter me lt's getting chilly Air's great in this part of the town, isn't it? lt happens when l'm nervous l haven't cooked in years Mr. Choi is a good cook He made food here? Time to time, ma'am On your birthday, it was Mr. Choi who made your birthday soup So typical of him How come you're not married? My youngest is going to college this year Oh, excuse me! Why did l think you weren't married... Please forgive me That's okay l get that from time to time How are things? Pardon? How are things at home? l don't go home much but still, it's great A President could make her people happy, even if she isn't happy herself, couldn't she? The President doesn't necessarily have to be happy to make the lives of people better, right? l may be wrong but l believe... just as a President wishes that all her people are happy, everyone wants their President to be happy Not a single person would want the President to be miserable You think so? That's what people want lt would be nice if the President devoted herself to making the people happy but people who have a miserable President cannot be truly happy Koreans are good people, A lot more so than you might think They are, aren't they? l'm only a cook but l know that much Can l leave this to you? You know l had lunch with the two former Presidents They both told me to pay a visit here, when faced with a dilemma that l cannot solve by myself Now l can see what they meant Thank you Where can she be at this hour? She's not at the Residence Sir, l received a report that she just left the main gate What are you talking about? Sir! The main gate! Right! The main gate! Don't get in the way you idiots! Why did you let her pass by herself? Would she go grocery shopping at this hour, dumbass? - l'll have you killed, all of you! - Sorry, sir! What did you say to her that made her disappear in the middle of the night? We were just chatting about happiness and other things... While picking anchovy guts? What are you talking about? God, this is annoying! Turn on the GPS Have a chopper locate the vehicle lt's the Blue House l'm the Chief of Security We know where she is headed Give them a call, too Put me on! Chief Joo? This is the Chief of Personnel Don't have her pull over in the city We can't let anyone see her Don't let the press find out, no matter what! Escort her out of the city, okay? She entered the highway Where's the next bottle neck point? An-sung lntersection, sir Stop the vehicle before she enters the intersection And, set up a road block in E7 West Coast Highway l'm sorry but this is a personal matter l assumed from the direction you were heading lt's appropriate to use the official escort for this Please let me take the wheel, ma'am l don't need an escort l won't be long Your driver's license has expired Would you like me to call you a cab? Maintain positions Destination is Madam President's in-laws' Here they are! You drove here Why are you out of breath? Shall we... dance? Did you practice? Did you mark ''6''? Mind your own ticket Let me see what you got Don't look at mine - Focus on yours - You have a lovely temper! ''6'' is a good number Says who? l hope l win the jackpot this time lt's not easy l know because l've done it before - You'll give it all away again? - l'll keep it all for myself People think that Presidents are special people Of course, they are not wrong in thinking that But, what we often forget is that at certain moments, they are someone's husband, wife or parent Their joy, sadness and happiness is not all that different from our own If an old President comes over for a drinks, or a President who has given up smoking asks for a cigarette ''A Very Special Kitchen'' ln the early morning, when he greets you with hello we say to him with a big smile, ''Good morning, President!''
