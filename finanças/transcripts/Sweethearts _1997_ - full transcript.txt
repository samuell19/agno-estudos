Captioning made possible by trimark home video [answering machine beeps] Hello. I'm Charles, and I'm looking for the perfect woman, uh, for me. She's got to be tall, blond, great body, killer smile, and good teeth. Good teeth are really important. I had a terrible incident with pyorrhea once, and I'd rather not get into it. Are you out there? I'm waiting for you. [Beep] [English accent] Hi. My name is Colin. I'm an actor, and, uh... It's funny. I feel as though I'm doing a voice-over here, except I'm not getting paid for it. I'm good-looking, witty, charming. I like myself, and I hope you'll like me, too. No. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a narcissist, just someone who has a healthy ego and a deep appreciation of himself. I do want to hear from you, so call me. [Beep] Man: Hi. I've never done this before. My name's Bob. I really like music. I'm really into alternative bands. [Beep] Hi. This is Chris. Basically, what I'm looking for is a smart-- [beep] Hi. This is Adam. Thanks for responding to my ad. Women tend to get upset, you know, when guys only think of them for their bodies, but-- [beep] Hi. I'm Eric. They say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but most of the women that I meet are tuna fish. [Beep] Hi. I'm arliss. Thanks for responding to my ad. I'm dying to meet someone who's nice, uncomplicated, attractive, slender, full of life-- someone who's secure enough not to wear any makeup and who loves to wear summer dresses. I'm a nice guy myself-- attractive, stable, financially secure-- ok, let's back up to "attractive." I don't know about that, but I'm stable, financially secure, easygoing, ready to settle down. So tell me about yourself-- what you do, what you look like, your name, number, a good time to call you. Hey, who knows? We might hit it off. Thanks.

You know, Jasmine, I really hope you're not some kind of freak. Of course, who am I kidding? Arliss. What kind of name is arliss? Arliss is a good name. Arliss is an all right name. Sounds masculine. Sounds like Alice, but... Let's move on. So, uh... Jasmine, what do you do? Really? Wow, that's fascinating. No. Yeah? And there's 4 of you in the office? Wow, that's great. That's fantastic. Me? Oh, I don't know. I consider myself a vagabond. I spend a lot of time talking to myself, actually. A whole lot of time. I'm considered lonely. I'm a lot lonely, and, henceforth, the call. Uh... No. I've been in relationships that I've not been crazy about. Monica, this one girl, who actually is one of those relationships where you, like, fall in love with her, and then she's, like, insane, and you don't realize it for a long, long time until they move in. And, of course, she had a lot of furniture, and we used a majority of her furniture, and, uh... Not that that's a bad thing. I mean, all of her stuff matches. None of my stuff matches, because my stuff is, like, "hey, are you using that? No? Can I have it?" So it turned into that, you know? But she was one of these girls that would just... Got really emotional and would start throwing stuff at me, like in the middle of a fight. Her veins would, like, pop out of her head, and just spit and stuff and, like, beet red. So, uh... I don't know. It's just one of those things. I--i... You know what? You really need to just shut up. You either need to shave or talk, ok? Or get, like, a dog or something that you can throw something at, and it'll bring it back. That's what you need. God, I don't know. Jasmine, please-- just bear with me and give me a little time here and don't be a freak. Please don't be a freak. Ah. Ok. All righty. Game over. That hurts.

Oh, so I'm Chinese now? No. That's not what I meant. It's just that most of the Chinese I've seen are on television, and... Ok. Why don't you order before you dig yourself any deeper? All right. I'll just have a cappuccino, please. Double or single? Single. Yeah. I knew that about you. Double. No. You are such a single. Guys come in here all the time asking for doubles, and they don't know what they're getting themselves into. A double is a lot of commitment. It can keep you up all night. Not everyone can handle it.

What if that's her? Or her? Am I making it worse? You could just tell me to fuck off. Fuck off. I'm sorry. You're going to get an ulcer. I've already had an ulcer. Would you excuse me? Phone? Yeah.

[Rock music playing] [Line ringing] Answering machine: Hi. This is arliss. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back. [Beep] Machine: You have no messages. Shit. God damn it. Fuck. Ohh. Hello, Tiffany. I'm sorry. Where were we? We were cut off. My name is Charles. Ohh. I like... Long walks on the beach and... Uhh! And black and white movies. Dear Tiffany... Ohh. I've never written a letter like this before. Oh, Tiffany. Tiffany. Charles: Hey, how you doing? Woman: Uh-huh. Colleen's here already. Uh-huh. I know. Where have you been? Uh, nowhere. You got a huge stain on your pants. Yeah, I know. It was him. How so? Well, when I was upstairs in the bathroom, he was in a stall, and he was... He was stirring something? He was beating... He was beating eggs, was he? Actually, he was jacking himself-- he was masturbating? Eesh. Yeah. Did you get aroused? No. Absolutely not. Why are we even having this conversation? Did you look at it? No. No. Uh-uh. No. I thought you guys checked each other out. No. We're not dogs, you know. Ok. I'm not accusing you of being a dog. Don't get agitated. No. I'm not agitated. It's just that I was-- when I was up there, I freaked a bit, and I was washing my hands and spilled water. And i-- goddamn. Where is she? Perhaps she's lost. She suggested this place. It was her idea, so... And you don't know what she looks like? She's brunette... Medium height, cotton dress-- a floral pattern-- and Jean jacket, sandals. And very pretty-- not a lot of makeup-- slender. Ah, slender. Tremendous. Good for you. "A"--that's what she looks like, or "b"--that's what you hope she looks like? Actually, "c"-- all of the above, I hope. So, what are you going to say to her when she gets here? You haven't replayed this in your mind about a million times? No, not really. Ok. Ok, ok, ok. You know what? Let's do a little ice-breaking exercise. I--you know... I'll be her. What's her name? Jasmine. Jasmine. I'll be Jasmine, and you are... Arliss.how you doing, arliss? Ok. Um... I'm going to be her, and you be you. Unless, of course, you want to be her, in which case, I'll be you. You know what? Really, I'd-- give me one minute to get into character. Character? Well-scrubbed and slender. All right. Man: There you go. Woman: Arliss. Arliss. God, please don't do this, please? I'm Jasmine. I'm lean. I'm conservative. Listen, all right? Let's just... Very eager to make your acquaintance. Listen, please don't do this. You must be Jasmine. You must be Jasmine. Oh, you must be Jasmine. Have we had the obligatory 30-minute phone conversation prior to this meeting? We played phone tag, all right? She's not that easy to get in touch with. Well, that's good. It kind of... Makes more mystery or something. You know what? If she shows up, you and I are just friends, ok? You know what? We're not even friends. We just happened to run into each other. You needed a match or something. And you have a boyfriend. You're waiting on a boyfriend here, all right? You're waiting on your boyfriend. Let me tell you something. If she comes here and sees you talking to another woman, you're going to seem a lot more appealing-- less desperate and neurotic. I'm not desperate. This is a high protein electrolyte lemonade mixture with just a hint of vodka. [Pours] I'm on the tenth day of a 7-day fast. Ok. That makes a lot of sense. Ahh. Doesn't it? You know what? I'm going to go back inside. I'll go with you. [Steam hisses] [Stilted Asian accent] You pick up your dry cleaning? Yeah. Could I get another cappuccino with extra foam, please? Nothing for your new girlfriend? Oh, no, she's not my girlfriend. No. And could I get a spoon, too? Yeah. We'll bring it over. All right. I like your hair. I think it's really cool. I like what you've done with it. It's really cool. Ok. Go back now. Ok. I'm--I'm, like... Right over there. I know. Ok. All right. Bye. Look, I appreciate-- do you have a light? I really need a smoke so desperately, and you don't smoke. I'm sure you don't smoke. But maybe you do smoke, and I'm judging a book. Am I being hasty? I know I'm being manic, but I really need a cigarette. Secondhand smoke does kill. I was reading one of my father's medical journals. I have a predilection for reading medical journals. That was a big word. That was obnoxious, wasn't it? Sorry. I do that sometimes. I think I'm trying to impress you, but I have all these medical journals that are sitting in my apartment unrecycled. I have copious amounts-- there I go again-- copious amounts of unrecycled papers sitting in my apartment. It's really criminal. What I need to do, to be conservative and enviro-friendly, is to get on-line. Are you on-line? I'm looking really forward to webstock. I think that kind of thinking can change your democracy. Do you have an e-mail address that I could e-mail you? 10 years ago, I almost drowned in my bathtub, and, um... Did you know that when you're starting to drown and the water goes into your lungs, it is similar to sleeping? Or the feeling is similar to sleeping? I mean, I didn't drown or anything, but it was kind of funny. Guess you had to be there. But if you think about the Titanic and all those people asleep in their deck chairs, it was a far more palatable tragedy. Is there somebody you want me to call? Why? Do I seem crazy? I'm not crazy. I may talk a lot, but I'm not crazy. If you met somebody really crazy, I'm telling you, you'd know it. The most disturbed person I ever met was my roommate Elizabeth. She was a borderline paranoid schizophrenic and had the worst halitosis in the world--bar none-- and she was attracted to me. Ew! But she did come from a very wealthy family, so when they came to take her out to dinner, I cashed in my chips on that one. Don't look at me like that. Yes, I spent some time in a hospital. So? I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. Although a lot of people do agree my mom should've never had children. I shan't. I've had my tubes tied. So, tell me something about yourself. Are you always this candid with people? No. It depends on my mood. Single cap... And I brought you extra spoons. Oh, great. Thanks. 2.65. Here you go. You can keep it. Keep it? 35 cents? That's all I mean to you? I'm hurt as your server, and I'm hurt as a man. Here's another buck. A whole buck, and I don't even have to put out? Wow. I'm going to Vegas. Do you find yourself attracted to other men? What kind of question is that? Oh, what, have I offended your delicate constitution? I'm sure your dream date wouldn't pose such a bawdy question. How would you know? I have a feeling. Well, the answer's no. It's a fact-- most, if not all, men have at one time in their life fantasized about having sex with another man. Then why did you ask me? Because it's a fact that most, if not all, men deny ever having had sex with another man. So, what, now I'm homophobic? Yes. Look... All right, look, I haven't had these feelings. All right? At least, not yet. I mean, you did say "have some time ever wondered." All right? So I could have these feelings, say, 2 years from now, which would be 2 years after you asked. So if you want to get technical, you'd actually have to wait until that very moment before I died, then ask me again. If you're there, please feel free. Unless you want to amend your statement to "most men experience these feelings, say, within the first 30 years of their life," in which case, the answer would be no-- definitely not. Anything else? No. Very well-thought-out response, but I don't believe you. I guess I just haven't found the right guy yet. I don't know, it just seems-- aw, shit. What? Look, I got to hide. This is not good. Oh, what's wrong? Not the girl of your dreams? No. She lied. She said she was slender. You said you never spoke to her. No. I specifically said in my ad "slender and attractive." I was very clear about that. God, I have zero tolerance for that kind of thinking. Attractive is such a subjective idea. It varies from culture to culture. What about the ubangi warrior women in central Africa? Case in point--they have plates in their lips-- huge plates in their lips. Take the plate out-- big old hanging lip. You know what? It's considered very beautiful. This is ridiculous. I can't even believe we're having this conversation. Shit. Why? I'm sorry. Look, can we just please get up and walk out of here right now? I think she's beautiful. Look... I'm going to go, then. It's been fun. I'm going to take off. Your aversion to heft makes you seem very unenlightened. Be a man. Look, manhood-- way overrated, all right? And I don't need your 2 cents right now. Why would I throw my 2 cents in? Here, look. Let's just go. Here's 40 bucks. Let's just get out of here. I can't be bought. Look, let's just go. I've got $47, all right? Mm-mmm. Excuse me? Oh, Christ. Hi. Where did you get that dress? Woman: It was a gift. It's very pretty. Man: Uh-huh. It's all right. Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit! Uh-huh. How you doing? Ok. Anyway, she's going to pick me up at home. All right? [Masturbating] Slender and attractive. Slender and attractive. I love your dress. Oh, man. Just...ok. Everything's like it should be. Just relax. Charles: Ahh... God damn it. [Toilet flushes] Man: Ok, what can I get for you? Hi. I'm arliss. Listen, there's been a huge mistake. I'd love to stay and have a cup of coffee with you, but, you see, I met someone this morning, and, actually, she lives in my building. I didn't even know she lived there. Um, so I would love to, uh, stay and buy you guys a cup of coffee, because you came all the way out here. Or tea. They have tea, if you'd like some tea. Mm-mmm. Sorry. Jasmine, i-- Jasmine, it's been a pleasure. Bye. Hi, honey. Hey, baby. I just met the strangest guy. Sweethearts. Oh, don't give me that face. This is your drama. I'm just a participant. And exactly what role are you playing? Me, I suppose. And does "me" have a name? You know, the little thing they put on your wristband when they put you in the padded room? Emily. Emily. Good answer, Emily. Unfortunately, I don't believe you, Emily. [Sighs] I don't feel very good. I'm going to go home. What's your name? What's your real name? I told you. Come on, seriously. [Whistles] Don't touch my stuff. Ah. You're Jasmine. Go figure. I'm sitting waiting on some coffee, and you're there with some napkins. Wow. The little role-reversal thing-- very nice, very polished. Ok. Don't get excited. I'm not excited. I'm pissed off. This is ridiculous. You're insane. You're a sick person. I'm sick? I'm sick? You were ready to ditch your date without getting to know her. Ditch my date? My date didn't show up, remember? This is ridiculous. You know what? You're not her, and she's not you, and you don't even look like her. Of course not. I'm not her. I'm me. Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for a very lovely evening of manipulating and coercing. I didn't coerce you. I didn't hold a gun to your head. You took total advantage of me. Uh-uh. I didn't take advantage. You were ready to leave because I didn't fit into your antiquated male fantasy. You wouldn't even tell me who you were. You told me you were somebody else. I never made you think I was someone else. You assumed. You never asked. You're turning this around. Look, you know what? I cannot believe you. You have absolutely no right to fuck with me or judge me or anything. After tonight, what, are you kidding me? I don't need a new conscience. I've got one. And don't even start in on your whole female feminist diatribe. My god, get on-line? You need to get with the program there, Jasmine. All right, what-- and I don't even know what a fucking ubangi lip-- whatever the fuck you were talking about earlier. You know what, though? I do know one thing. I was really looking forward to tonight. I was really looking forward to tonight. Really. I mean, this new jacket-- I don't even--whoa. I don't even want to get into that. I liked your voice. I really liked your voice. That's why I answered your ad. You should have just been honest with me. You wouldn't have called me back. You don't know that. God... Could you not go yet? Wait, wait, wait! Arliss, arliss, please. I'm sorry. Don't leave. Don't do this, ok? I'm sorry that you're angry. I am--oh, god. I would feel terrible if you left right now. Just give me one second to make reparations. You've had all night. Thank you very much. No, come on! I did not--i-- it was no premeditated, and you're-- oh, I'm so sorry. Things just never turn out the way I picture them. Listen to me. It's my birthday. I don't mean to spring that on you. It's not your obligation to shoulder that, and I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I don't have anyone to spend it with. I would really appreciate it if you don't go away mad. I'd be terribly upset, and I'd... Just please spend my birthday with me. They have a really good roof-patio place on the top of this place, and, uh... Just, I'm sorry. Just please don't go. I don't know what else to say. And that can be your birthday present to me, and now you're off the hook. I didn't do anything, and I'm off the hook? Makes a lot of sense. Ok, whatever, all right? Just--my treat? Uh... Please. It's no trouble, really. You sure? It is a little bit of trouble, but honestly, any reason that I get to get out of that shithole downstairs is good for me, you know? Yeah. Noreen: Isn't it beautiful up here? It's really great up here. I've been up here before. Well, enjoy-- um, what's your name? I'm arliss. Arliss. Jasmine. Noreen. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Enjoy. The view is lovely, the cake is lovely, sheis very lovely. She flatters me. [Giggles] Have fun. So? So. So if it's your birthday, how old are you? 31. 6:13 A.M. to be exact, but I figured I'd get a jump on the celebration tonight 'cause I'm going away tomorrow. Oh, wow. You gonna go see your folks? Oh, good god, no. I can't think of a worse way to spend my birthday than with my family. I rarely, if ever, see them or speak to them. My father's a closet racist and, uh... My mother makes Anne sexton look like Donna Reed. And as luck would have it, my brother's just a misogynist pervert, so, other than that, they're great, though. A lot of fun. So what do you do for money? I temp. I accept money from my grandma, my benevolent benefactor, and, um, I'm desperately trying to write a book. About what? It's a story about the time I drove cross-country once and my car broke down in Gary, Indiana, and I met some guy who tried to help me fix my car, and I wound up living with him for 4 years-- much to his chagrin. And, um... He kinda had a hard time dealing with my mood swings. Why is that? I mean, who doesn't have mood swings? To be perfectly frank, I'm a bipolar manic-depressive. So what is manic-depressive? I don't get it. Essentially, it's a chemical imbalance in the brain. It runs in my family, and I'm a rapid cycler. Um, so I guess, to put it in simple terms, sometimes you'll catch me, and I'll be redecorating my apartment in a frenzy, or I'll be on the kitchen floor in the fetal position, weeping uncontrollably. Just depends. But, um... Is there anything you can do for it? Oh, man, I've done it. Lithium, klonopin, tegretol, depakote. But as far as I'm concerned, the side effects of those types of things are just as bad as the episodes themselves, and I decided I can't do it anymore. So, uh, as of tomorrow, I'm putting it all behind me. So what happens tomorrow? [Sighs] Ahem. Why are we talking so much about me? Let's nottalk about me. My life is really boring. I work for a chocolate manufacturing company. Marketing chocolate. That's what I do. Look, what I don't understand is if there's a treatment for you, why haven't you done it before? This disease is treatable. It's not necessarily curable. It varies from person to person. I mean, I have some friends who do very well. I have one friend who's a pilot, he's married, he has 3 children. I can't drive. I have to take public transportation. Um... I wasn't ready before. I'm 31 now. I'm ready. I'm ready. [Sighs] That cake has been mocking me this whole time. What's gonna happen? You're on a 10-day fast. So fast it's over. Fuck it. But in honor of your presence, you get the first bite. I hate chocolate. [Chuckles] I do. Noreen: So you finished? Yeah, yeah. Noreen: Now, what I don't understand is how anybody could share this cake, much less not finish it. It is sogood. Jasmine: I could not agree more, but I can't go into it right now. I have to make a good impression and pretend I wouldn't finish that on my own and beg you for more. So do you want anything else? Um... I'm fine. Thank you. All right, I'm gonna go eat this little piece of cake. [Laughter] I told you I wanted to stay up here for 60 minutes exactly. I feel compelled to do so. Will you please get down? Would you relax? I'm taking a walk on the wild side, literally. No. Come on, let's get down. Seriously. Stop! God! Tell me what you do for a living. I told you what I do. I know, but you won't be specific. No, it's chocolate. I mean, what's chocolate? It's chocolate. Come on now. You're being evasive about your job. Is there something illegal about what you do? Ok, fine. Pornographic chocolate, all right? Like a 5-foot candy bar with tits. That's what I do, all right? Chocolate thongs, fallopian tubes-- you name it, it's chocolate. There you go. Exotic and erotic chocolate. Yeah. How exciting for you. Very impressed, aren't you? I'm not proud of it. What's so funny about that? I just find pornographic chocolate to be an interesting profession. Yeah? And since pornography is being credited with the debasement of our society and the breakdown of the nuclear family, I am now going to have to take my leave of you via the fire escape. It was nice knowing you, arliss. Seriously. Don't do this. Don't do this. Please, don't do this. [Sighs] This is not good. I am totally kidding. Trust game. [Groans] Ahh. What? Whatever treatment place you gotta go tomorrow, I hope everything works out great. You really deserve it. Are you mad? Exactly when were you planning on telling me who you really were, "Emily"? Yeah. That's what I thought. Hope you have a really nice birthday. Thank you very much for an interesting evening, but I'm gonna go. Arliss... I was just kidding! Arliss. What? I'm going home, all right? Arliss! What?! You're gonna stay. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. No. Thank you. This is loaded! Great. A loaded backpack. Thank you very much. Thank you, god, that I have a flak jacket on. Thanks a lot. You're nuts, you know that? You're nuts. I'll use it. Fine. Then use it. You're nuts, know that? I will! You're fuckin' nuts. [Bullet ricochets] I told you! I told you it was loaded! And I told you I would use it! And now we're gonna go to your place! You know what? That--no. That's not a good idea, ok? 'Cause my cousin's there. You know what? He would hate this. That's like a running thread through my family: Gun--not good. This whole thing here? I'm not--no. And he's there with some friends. And he's been there, and they're doing death of a salesman. They're actors. And they got a whole troupe of people over there that would not be happy to see you, all right? You lose the bag you can sit around there for awhile, but as long as that thing's going on--not a good idea. So listen, why don't we just calm down here for a second, ok? 'Cause you're spooky chick. This is getting out of hand. So just calm down now. Ok, I don't even wanna go to your place anymore. The thought of going to your place is depressing me. We're gonna go back inside. We're going back inside! I hate the fact that you don't wanna be with me right now. I'm loving being with you right now. I don't want us to-- go. Fine. Everything--just-- let's just-- hey, I'm with you on this. Really. [Guitar music playing] Don't you guys ever leave? 2 double espressos, please. No, no, no. That table. Sit, sit, sit. [Singing softly] Look, this is not a good idea, all right? A lot of people have seen us together. I need a cigarette. Is this like a regular date for you? A little coffee, a little execution? Excuse me, sir. Do you have a cigarette? Sorry. Don't smoke. Double espressos. Thank you. Do you have a cigarette? Oh, you can't smoke inside. Oh, come on. I'm sorry. Do you mind if I say something impertinent? Uh, well, I just consider myself a student of the human condition, which means I notice things that other people might not see. I guess I'm just naturally curious and tend to stick my nose in other people's psyche. And I'm an uncontrollable chatterbox, so if I get boring just stop me. Anyway, here goes. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that you're no coffee lover. I mean, you're definitely no editor of a 'zine or anything. And, uh, you--sorry. You definitely belong here. I see people like you all the time. You just sit in places like these and just watch people. You'll talk to people-- like me. I'll talk to anybody. And you won't talk to anybody unless they talk first, right? Yeah. So, uh, what's my point? Yeah. Well, um... I don't get it--you two. Opposites attracting? I mean, I see it, but I just don't understand it. That's because-- what? What? You kicked him. Didn't. Yes. Did not. You did. Did not. See? Oh, man. Is that your leg? Yeah. Thought I was kicking the table leg. Before you wrap it up, what were you saying? Well, um... I just wanna say that if this thing works out between you guys, I think it would be really neat.

How old are you? I'm, uh, 34. Why? Time to move on. Am I getting fired again? No, I'm giving you advice. Get yourself a real woman. As opposed to? Um, Stephanie. Uh, no, uh, her name's Tiffany. She's very real. She's the, uh, 3-time champion miss nude world. [Sighs] No. She's gross. She'sreal. She's beautiful. I don't like being kicked, all right? What do you want from me? [Light applause] Hey. Sounded great, man. I want you to sit there and behave and be quietlike a normal human being. Normal human beings don't have loaded backpacks pointed at them by some hopped-up, twisted-out, whacked-out chick at a coffee shop. And, look, I really feel for you. 'Cause I don't get along with my parents either. Who does? And the tide's gonna turn, so just hang with us, all right? And please... Back off with the kicking. Something about a woman with a gun. Uh, she's got a gun? There's something so great about her. She's--she's--you-- did you see the gun? Do I look Chinese to you? Uh, I don't--did you really see a real gun? Mmm. Cover me, will you? I gotta go to my car. When you say cover, you mean, like, am I supposed to work for you or cover you because... That wing nut might snap and start shooting up the place? Eww. Why'd you give me that? Charles: 'Cause... 'Cause you like it. Drink your coffee. Drink your coffee, please. Normal human beings-- if there is such a thing, I'm not one of them. Yes, I've always wanted to be popular, but I think getting up early to kill myself disqualifies me. This gun is not for you. Least that's not why I brought it here, but you're making me use it on you. Don't make me use it. You're serious, aren't you? Yes, I am. Then why me? When did I pick the lucky number? I sorta forgot about that part. I need--i need a body. I need a person. I need someone with me tonight. I can't be by myself. I don't wanna talk myself out of tomorrow. Tomorrow morning, at 6:13 A.M. Will be the most significant event of my whole shitty life. Using this gun on myself on some random Tuesday doesn't mean Jack shit. It's gotta be tomorrow morning. That's when I was born, that's when I expire. So just bear with me. Ugh. Ah, nothing like a good strong Espresso to kick start you after a long depression, huh? Don't worry about it. I'm won't involve you on some morbid level. You don't have to watch me do it, ok? When I'm gone, or when we part company, you're not gonna hear from me again. So don't worry about it. If you lead a nice, virtuous life and pray to the baby Jesus, perhaps you can be having coffee with your cotton-dressed virgin this time next week. Sorry. I wanted something impromptu. I hope you don't mind. What are you doing? I'm studying black-and-white photography. The teacher says, "carry your camera wherever you go. "Photo ops are everywhere." Don't do that? I'm not gonna do anything weird with these pictures. It's just for my class. You give me your address, I'll send you prints. One more. Can we be done now? Is this really necessary? I don't want you running away. You know what, look, I don't care if you want to kill yourself. I don't have a problem. I'm won't tell anyone. I don't care who you tell. You're not listening to me! God. I gotta pee. Well...quickly. Ok. Ok. [Whispering] Personal ads, fuck you! Fuck...you. I'll get my money back. Just get your money back. You know what? Get your money back times 2. That's what, $69? You take yourself out, you go have a nice meal by yourself. What'd you do, fall in? What are you doing? There should be a screening process. That's the problem with these programs. Screening process, a questionnaire, something. [Knocking] What are you doing? Man. You know, this would really be funny if it was happening to somebody else. [Knock on door] Just a second. I have given you ample time to urinate. I'm gonna start counting right now. Look, just one second, all right? 5, 4... 3, 2... 1. Relax, all right? I'm still here. Why are you smiling? What did you do? It was, uh... What did you write? "Call police." "Girl moth gin downers." What the fuck? It's "call police. Girl with gun downstairs." Does that look like an "o"? That's an "I." It's w-i-t-h. And that's g-u-n, not g-i-n. And that's--downers? Give me a fuckin' break. That's d-o-w-n-s-t-a-i-r-- s-t-u-p-i-d. God! Damn it, I knew I couldn't trust you. Please get in the stall. I need a minute to think. Just...uhh... This would be so much funnier if it was happening to somebody else. Why does nothing ever turn out the way I want it to? Look, you don't want to kill me, all right? You're a good person. I can tell that. What'd you expect me to do? You got a gun. It's my job to try to get away. Mmm. [Sniffing] It's a big mistake here. A big mistake. It's a big, big, big mistake. Come on, just give me-- come on. I'm overwhelmed, and you're not helping me out at all right now. I'm begging for my life, and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm begging for mine, and I'd beg for yours, but you don't seem to give a shit. Ok, look, just be cool here for 2 seconds. Why don't you just relax for 2 seconds? Now since I have to be here anyway, and I don't wanna be, why don't you give me this opportunity to convince you not to kill yourself. How about that, huh? I know that's not your plan. That's very funny. I'm serious. What if I convince you not to? Yes. Yes, you, the manufacturer of confectionery cocks are gonna somehow say something very edifying and convince me to eradicate my personal and biological pain and turn me into a very healthy, well-functioning individual overnight. It doesn't matter what I'm gonna do, all right? You don't wanna shoot yourself or anybody. This is all about attention. This is all about you. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Oh! All about attention! God, I hate when people say that shit! You're so wrong! No, I'm so right! That's why you called me. You need somebody to give you permission to live. That's my job. Admit it. That's why I'm here. I will not admit anything. You're so off-base! Fine. God damn it. Then shoot yourself, please. I will shoot myself-- tomorrow! No, no! Why wait till tomorrow? Why not just do it right now, all right? How about that? Shut up! The important thing is that you put a bullet through your head. You can do that now. You wanna do that? Huh? You know what? Fuck it! Fuck it! Why don't you kill me? How about that? Why don't you just fuckin' kill me? Shut up! Take the goddamn gun out, and tomorrow morning we'll-- shut up! [Click] God damn it! Fuck me! I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick. [Purse drops] Ohh. Ohh. [Gulps] Mmm. Why... [Sobbing] You're fuckin' serious. Hey, look... Let's just relax for 2 seconds, all right? Let's just calm down. I promise you everything's gonna be fine. Everything is totally cool. It's gonna be all right. Don't touch me! I don't like being touched. What are you hitting me for? Look, why don't we just get some of your electrolysis lemonade? Electrolyte. Yeah. Whatever. Everything's cool here, all right? All right, everything's gonna be fine. Here you go. I think it's... Sorry. Bullet hole. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It's come to this. [Inhales deeply] Try to kill myself in a scuzzy bathroom, and I'm still here. [Groans] You know what we need to do is just go downstairs and get some real food, all right? Because you don't want to go off a 10-day fast with chocolate. That's not the way to go. A 10-day fast. That's such bullshit. I can't stay away from food for 10 minutes. That's why I'm so fucking fat. You're not fat. I'm fat. I'm a liar. I'm an underachiever. I don't have any friends. You're good with guns. I'll give you that. I feel sick. I'm gonna use the bathroom. Look, I think I'm gonna take off, ok? No. Stay there. And you can't leave, 'cause I can see your feet, and I'll shoot you. [Sniffles] This is so weird. What if somebody comes in? Could you just plug your ears or tell me a story or make noise or do something? I was in, uh, choir... In church, and the day of-- like, when we were supposed to have a special thing at Christmas... It's just that when I was a kid, we--i never really liked to sing, but we were in church, and they made you do it, sorta like Sunday school. And then there was this big Christmas thing going on. And then everybody and their brother was there, and all my parents friends, and then I, like, choked. And, you know, it just... I'm coming out. Seems weird to... [Exhales loudly] Ho. You still gotta wash your hands. What? Wash your hands. I'll be very hygienic when I'm cremated. That's really morbid, you know it? Yeah, suicidal people usually are. Take 5 minutes to wash your hands for me. After all I've been through today, just wash them. All right, all right, all right, all right. Satisfied? Were you listening to us? No. Why are you standing here? Were you eavesdropping? I have to go to the bathroom. Did you hear what we were saying? No. You're in the men's room. You're a freak. Come on. So why'd you hit me? Oh, I hit you because... An impulse. Christ, I don't know. I never hit anybody before. This another one of your manic-depressive things? Uh-uh. As trite as this is gonna sound, I think I hit you because you remind me of my dad, whether it be your demeanor or your mannerisms... I don't know. I told you he was an asshole. Well, look, the next time I remind you of your father, will you do me a favor and think of something else? You oughta just give the guy a call and get all this off your chest. Yeah, that'll solve everything. Thank you. Think about the happy times. It can't all be that bad. What, are you kidding me? Why don't you just call him? Here's a quarter. You want me to call him now? No, let's wait till after the funeral. Yes,right now. It's too--i can't. We can't call the house after 10:00. You're brave enough to put a gun to your head, but not brave enough to call your father? That makes a lot of sense. You're confusing bravery with desperation. Let's go call the guy right now. Just take 5 minutes and call him. Ahem. Relax. Hi. Hi, dad. It's me. I know. It's late. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. [Crying] I know. I gotta go. I'm gonna go. Hey, I wanted to get your address so I could send you those prints. Can we do it later? You're here. That's observant. What did he say? Why didn't you leave? I thought you didn't want me to leave. It was another in a series of stilted conversations. I want you to stay. Then you gotta ask me to stay nicely. Don't patronize me. You're an adult. You can make your own decisions. Yeah, but a minute ago, I was an adult with a gun in my face. So you're gonna have to give me a few minutes to adjust to my status as a free man. I am a free man, right? I want you to stay. You gotta give me that gun. Mm-mmm. Then I'm gonna leave. Then I'll shoot you. Look, let's not start doing this again, ok? No! [Gunshot echoing] Everything's fine. Can you put mom on? Ok, if you want, we can do it tomorrow. Noreen: Hey, where's your girlfriend? Oh! Did he pay? [Rings] Woman: Suicide hotline. Ok, I met this girl tonight, and I think she's gonna kill herself. Are you with her right now? No. I met her in a coffee shop. She's not here. She's still there and... Do you know how she's going to do it? Um, I think with a gun, but I'm not sure. She has a gun and you think she's planning to use it? Yes, on herself. Nobody-- right. We can call the cops, and they can go get her and take her to a hospital. She's a danger to herself. No. I think-- I don't want to do that. I don't think that's a good idea because I think she's gonna-- that's not a good idea at all. Ok, the best thing you can do right now is be there and let her talk to you about it. Let her know that you're there and it's ok for her to talk to you about it. Well, I've pretty much done that, but I just... Ok, well, you can't keep her from killing herself. You can't be responsible for that, but you can sit and listen and be there for her. I know that. I understand that, and I appreciate it, but I don't know, you know? I don't-- you know what? Listen, thank you very, very much, and I hope you have a lovely evening. Thanks. Fuck.

I got you something for your birthday if you want it. You got me a present?! You got me a present for my birthday! Oh! That... That is so great. This is what I would wear to my own funeral. How do I look? Somehow I knew you were going to say that. This is great. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am beyond touched. Then tomorrow night we meet here and have a real date. I come and get you and we spend the night together here. All night. Thanks for the hat. I can't do that. There's no chance at all you're gonna change your mind? No. Maybe. Maybe. You know, I honestly do not believe that god would put anybody on this earth without some partner. 'Cause there's somebody for everybody, right? I guess so. I've been sitting around for the longest time wondering where's my girl? Where's that person I get to come home to, all right? And just look forward to seeing all the time? Do I even know her? Is it a temp when I come to work next week? Or even somebody that lives in my building that I've passed a thousand times and never even said anything to? I don't know. You know, just as weird and odd as tonight is, I think this is the story I'm supposed to tell our grandchildren. Me and you are going to sit down with our grandchildren and tell them about tonight. I'm so attracted to you right now. I love listening to the ocean. I could fall asleep to the ocean... Crickets, washing machine... [Laughs] And in a pinch, Vicodin and wine. When we--when my family and I actually hung around together-- when I was growing up, we had a shore house down at spring lake, which is in New Jersey, and our house was right on the sand, right on the beach, and every night that we slept there, I would just fantasize about diving into the blackness of the ocean. Just being able to swim deep enough past whatever is the ocean's bottom, I guess. And that if you could poke through the sand floor, there would be an entire parallel universe like in wizard of oz, when it goes from black and white to color. Yeah. It would be something similar to that wherein the quality of life would be so much superior to the one I was experiencing. I hate the water, you know? Why? First time I ever actually saw the ocean or got in the water, my family went to myrtle beach. My dad's like, "get in the inner tube, son." [Laughing] So I get in the inner tube, right? And the tide takes me really far out. And you're a kid, and you're stupid, so this is fun. I look up and there's people on the beach. I can't hear them, just see them. Then you hear those "rrr rrr rrr." The coast guard ends up coming, I'm totally embarrassed. They take me back in, my dad talks me back into the inner tube, throws me back out. I have a story like that. You know those kickboards that you have when you're in the swimming pool? Yeah. I was sitting on one once when I was little, and it flipped over so your feet are facing upwards. And like a roach that gets stuck on its back, I kept kicking. I couldn't get the kickboard to flip back over. And rather than admit defeat, I almost died because I was too humiliated to try and signal for help. That's what's so funny. My dad just patted me on the ass and put me back in the tube. "Try it again, son." [Laughing] I think I lied to you earlier, but I don't know. What about? When I was in high school, I thought this guy was attractive, but I wasn't the only one. It was a given. This is the good-looking guy in school, you know? I thought he was attractive. I wasn't jumping on the bandwagon, "yeah, he is," or "yeah, check him out." It was just, you know-- why does this throw you into such a panic? It doesn't make you gay. It makes you normal. All right. Ok? Ok. That's so great you had a boyfriend in high school. ...during his residency, and they began living in sin before they were married. Arliss: Nice. Jasmine: Why is he here? Arliss: I didn't call him. Officer Carter: Excuse me, can you help me out here? Jasmine: My ride is here. Carter: That's all right. We'll just walk you out. How you doing tonight? Fine, thanks. Is there a problem, officer? Her boyfriend. Who are you? No, there's no problem. I got a call-- she's got a gun. Who are you? Charles Riley bender, assistant manager. Did you see the gun? Technically, no, but my friend did. That's not what I said! You misunderstood me! Ma'am, can I look inside your bag? He was upstairs jerking off. That's why he can't think straight. I--what? In the stall next to me jerking 90 miles an hour. I don't think that's against the law, but I wasn't doing it anyways. It's not a crime for Charles to explore his erotic possibilities. All right, folks. [Arguing] People, please, listen up! Just for a second. Hold on! Ma'am, if I could just take a look inside your bag, I'll be on my way. You're full of shit. You're full of shit, you're full of shit, and I don't appreciate your intervention. I don't mind at all. I'm sorry this has escalated into such a ridiculous situation. I'm sorry. Thank you. No problem. Where'd you put it? In my shirt. I got it. Can I just say again how sorry I am that Charles called the police? I swear to god, he's such a drama queen, and I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. It's just insane, and I apologize. I'm gonna go to the jabberjaw. My girlfriend's band is playing. Hot dog pussy. Maybe you've heard of them. Yeah. No, thanks. Maybe another time then. Jasmine: You can go if you want. Nah, we'll go another time. You should-- you should go. Well, at least let me get your address so I can send you these pictures. Oh, no. Man, ecch. I hate what I look like in pictures. But thank you. How can you say that? You're so beautiful. You're such a liar! Please let me take just one more picture. Just one more. It'll be really great. Get close. Oh, that's beautiful. Thank you! [Laughs] Well, I guess I'll take off then. Can I ask you a question? You claim to be this student of the human condition. So what if somebody you really care about is going to do something really stupid. Well, how stupid? Like, really stupid. You're wasting your time. Relax. Well, I guess all anybody can do is just be there. Be there for your friend and listen. Listen for what? To whatever they have to say. What's stupid for you might make a lot of sense to them. Shit, what time is it? It's like 1:20. Gotta go. Uh... Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, too. Thanks. Sure. Good night. Night. Tenacious little man, aren't you? I don't understand how you could want to go through with this after what we did tonight. Thank you for the hat. This isn't about a hat. [Sighs] I want to just enjoy this moment right now. I cannot enjoy this moment. [Clicking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I stole them off the cop. I don't want to have to do this to you. It's just that-- [Sighs] Things have to work out the way I want them to now, and I think this is gonna help, but I hope nothing happens to you, and, god, if you do exist, just protect him. I'm sorry. Don't do this. Come on. This is ridiculous. You almost made a difference. Please don't do this. Thank you. Wait! Don't do this! Come on! I want to stay up with you all night. We'll talk. Come on, this is so selfish. Come on, don't do this! Please? Come on! Look, I... You know, you suck me into your world and then you-- this is not fair at all! Come on here! Come on now! Jasmine, please? Come on! [Police radio crackling] Did you know the number she gave you was a service? No. There's no way we can track down her address from that. Best I can do is put out a bulletin. This girl is serious. She's gonna kill herself. Listen to me, pal. If you'd leveled with me earlier, maybe this wouldn't be happening. I suggest you go home and wait by the phone. Maybe she'll call you. Right. Right. I'll be driving around. If I hear of anything, I'll let you know. I really appreciate it. All right. Listen, there's nothing you can do. Take it easy. Thanks a lot. [Telephone rings] Jasmine: Hi, I'm not here right now. Please leave a message. Thanks. Bye. [Beep] Jasmine, this is arliss. You gotta call me. I'm here at home. 555-1775. Please, give yourself another chance here. I want to listen to whatever you have to say. I really, honestly do, so call me. I'm gonna keep leaving you messages until you do. [Beep] Look, I know you're getting these messages, all right? And I know you want to call me back or whatever, but you're just afraid. You've made up your mind, and I'm real proud of you, and that's all well and good, just, please, just do me the favor of picking up the phone and giving me a call. Just let me hear your voice one more time. That's it. [Beep] Yeah, it's arliss again. Listen, this is call number 3. It's about 20 minutes later and you still haven't called, but you know that. Look, um...Just give me a call. That's all I'm asking here. And, uh--just one single damn call. Do that much for me, and you-- you don't even have to listen, I'll do the talking. How redundant is that? I've totally lost my mind here. I'll just listen to anything you have to say, all right? Anything you want to say, I'm here to listen. So, please call me, all right? This is not good. All right? 1775. All right? 1775. Last 4 numbers, 1775. Jesus Christ, Jasmine, this is total torture, and I don't think this is fair at all. You know what, at least do me the honor of knowing that you're ok, all right? Don't do this, all right? Just pick up the phone. Familiar with the phone? Pick it up and use it, all right? [Rings] [Rings] Hello? Uh, i--officer Carter, no. Uh-uh. No, sir, I called her a couple of times, but she hasn't called back or anything. Yeah. Just the service. All right. Oh, ok. If you hear something, you give me a buzz. All right. Bye. Recording: This person's voice mail is full. Please call back later.

She got what she wanted, I guess. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be. It's all right. You know, I'm developing now in my class, and your pictures were the first ones I did. They're really good. God, where are they? Here they are. Maybe you want them? You know what... You know what, why don't you hang onto them? In fact, I think I'm gonna take off, but... What about your double?
