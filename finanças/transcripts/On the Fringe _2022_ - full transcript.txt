What about your meetings, gatherings and stuff to save the world? I'll call them off. I will. I'll turn my phone off and spend the afternoon with you. I'll go shower. You should've told me I'd have to deal with the pregnancy alone, Rafa. You're not alone, honey. I left Raúl's authorization form on the kitchen table. - Don't forget it, please. - I won't. I'm going to work. I love you. Badia el Hataui? Police. We need to speak to you. Badia el Hataui! Hey, is your mother in? You speak Spanish, right? We need to talk to your mother.

Okay? Maybe you saw her two, three or four days ago? Look at me. Was it two days ago? Three, four? Help me here. How long ago? No… I saw her last night. You saw her last night? That's not what you said before. When did you see her? In the morning. In the morning. You're not lying to me, are you? You know I'm an officer and you can't lie to me, right? You have to tell me the truth. You know that, right? You do? HQ confirms she has a file open with Social Services. Okay, call them. Look. My partner here says we're not the only ones worried about you. So here's what we'll do. You'll come with us. No, please. We'll take you to a place where you'll be fine, I promise. Please, I don't want to go! - You can't stay here alone. - Please, no! Selma, please, get off the table. - No! I don't want to go! - Please, get off the table. No! What if Mom comes and I'm not here? - You can't stay here alone. - No! - It's for your own good. - Please! - It's for your own good! - Leave me here! No! - No, come on. Help me. - No. - You'll love it, it's a nice place. - Please, leave me here. No! Listen. We have to go. My partner says we have to go. - No! - Yes. Let's go. - No! - Yes, we have to go. - Come on, let's go. - I want to stay with my mom. - But... - Please! Come on, let's go. - You can't be alone. Let's go. - No! - I don't want to go! - We'll let you put on the siren. We'll let her put on the siren in the car, right? It'll be cool. - I don't like it! - It's really cool. Watch out. - You'll see, it'll be cool. - No! - No, I don't want to go! - Come on. - You'll hurt yourself. - Let's go. - It's for your own good. - I don't want to. No! Paty, listen to me. I can't go to the meeting, okay? But it's fine, you do it. It's fine. Yeah, it's fine. You'll be fucking great. What time is Azucena's thing? I don't know if I'll make it. Okay. The office is calling. I'll call you later, okay? Hi, Luis. Something's come up and I have to cancel it all. I have to cancel it all. Shit. Can't it wait? Can't you take it to the courthouse? Okay. Okay. We'll talk later, okay? C'mon, I'm in a wicked mess. I have to stop for a sec to give somebody a thing, okay? Rafa. We won't make it. - It's one second, it's nearby. - We won't make it. It's one second. I won't be long. - I don't want to! - Let's go. - No! - Come on. - Leave the girl alone! - I don't want to! - Rafa, we won't make it. - They need it. I won't be long. What the fuck, Rafa? - Let's go. - No! - I don't want to! - Get inside. No! Officers! I know the girl! Wait! Wait! Fuck! Fuck! The number you have dialed does not match any client. Fuck! Fuck! What are you doing? Fuck! Rafa, the buses are leaving now. - Rafa. - OK. Let's go, let's go. - They'll have gone. - Shit! DULCE CHACÓN HIGH SCHOOL - The buses from the excursion? - Long gone. Thanks a lot, Rafa! Thanks a lot! - I'm sorry, Raúl. - Yeah, you're real sorry. Sorry. I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't an emergency. I've been looking forward to this trip for ages. Is there no one left who didn't go on the excursion, who had class? Who? We were all going, we were coming on Friday. Listen, I've got a lot to do. I have to do it fast, so you have to come with me. No, thanks, I'd rather go get my mother. Your mother's working. You have to come with me. - Then drop me at home. - I don't have time. Okay. Forget it, I'll get the metro. Raúl, listen to me. I don't have time to argue. I'm not arguing with you. I'll just get the metro. Shit, Raúl, don't do it to me. I'm in a hurry. Come on… Listen, I screwed up, totally. I'm so sorry. But things are fucked up, they really are. That girl you saw needs help. I don't know if the mother's under arrest, losing custody, - if something's happened to her… - Then go help her. I can't if I know you're alone. I'm always alone. Don't shit me. But all day I'm thinking you're in trouble, drinking beer, smoking dope, or… - I don't smoke dope. - I saw a block of hash in your room. It wasn't mine. I'm just asking you to stay out of trouble. - Not today. - Okay. - "Okay," no. - Leave me alone! Fuck. - Fuck. - Wait. Listen, listen, listen. I'll give you money. - What? - I'll pay you. Every 45 minutes, 4 euros. That sucks. Your mother's the one with the money. - 3. - 5. Okay. What's this? Fuck. Don't drag your bag. Look at it! Don't drag your bag. Shit! What do you want? Come on, you'll be late. Azucena. Hold up. I won't tie you up. I found out about your thing tomorrow. You've got my number, right? - For anything you need… - This one, right? - Thanks a lot, really. - Don't mention it. Call me, OK? - Okay. - Chin up! - Anything else? - No, nothing else. It says you can't get it not for two weeks, Teodora. Yes, I looked at home and I can't find them. The doctor prescribed this. - My head's a mess. - Relax, that happens. Weren't you getting the girl? Yes, later. I've got this first. Jeez… - Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you? - This is my son Raúl. Stepson. How does it look, Rafa? I don't know, you never know. Where's Azucena? STOP EVICTIONS Manuel, I'm almost there. I don't know if you're there or you're not going. Tell me, please. - Thanks a lot. - Hi, honey. You're not alone. - Where's Paty? - There. - Thank you for coming. - We're with you. Relax. - Where's Manuel? - I don't know. Don't worry, eh? - How are you? Ready? - Well… Thanks a lot, eh? - It'll turn out fine. - Let's go. Come on, let's go. - Do you want to go in? - No way. Everyone inside! This bank defrauds and deceives!

Francisco, sorry to bother you again. It was in case you had any news of Germán. Thanks, I appreciate it. If he calls or you find out anything, please tell me, eh? Hi, Paula. How are you? Good, thanks. I was calling in case you had news of Germán. Right. Hey, look this way Five only. You. You, you. Yes, you. You. That's it. Thank you. Almost a decade later, the consequences of the bank bailout keep emerging. A request has arrived at Congress to turn all Sareb dwellings into public housing. VOICE MESSAGE MOM 10 years ago, Luis de Guindos, the then Minister for Economy, declared that the bank bailout wouldn't cost citizens a single euro. Today the so-called Bad Bank Debt has come to 35 billion euros. A debt that has increased the public deficit by 3 points, to 120%. You should've told me this before. I thought we'd stop it this morning at the bank. Right. What a pisser. - But these are for tomorrow, right? - Yes, at 9. Tomorrow is Wednesday. You have afternoon shift. Sure, but if it all goes sour, I'll need the afternoon to see where we're going, what we do with the furniture, the things, the boy… But if you don't come in, I, well… the company obliges me to report it and you know what that means. - I can't lose this job, Pablo. - Sure, I know. And I don't know if I'll be in any state to come. Sure, but it's not up to me. Hi, honey. Look, I need… Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I left him there. Yes, he looked happy. Listen, who can I ask for a favor in your old zone? I need to see a file of yours. Sure… Sure, I know you can't. That's why it's a favor. It's very urgent. The police took a girl away this morning. I don't know if it's a wardship thing. It's in your old area. Luisa… Luisa what? Okay. Okay, fantastic. Thanks a lot. - Excuse me, you can't go in. - I'll only be a minute. You can't go in without an appointment. I'm Luisa's husband. This is her son, Raúl. - We'll leave in a minute. - Okay. Thank you. - "Luisa." - Hey, I'm next. - It'll just be a minute, I... - I'm in a hurry. - I just need to give my wife something. - Okay, whatever. Thank you. SEXIST VIOLENCE KILLS - Hello. Luisa? - Sorry, but it's Manuela's turn. I know, I'm sorry I cut in line. I'm Rafa. This is my son, Raúl. Stepson. I'm Helena's partner. She used to work here. - I don't know if she called you… - No, she didn't. Okay, I'll explain. The police took a little girl this morning. - Right. - I know her mother, Badia el Hataui. - Maybe she rings a bell… - No, she doesn't. Okay. The thing is I don't know if they took the girl to a shelter, if her mother was arrested or if a guardian was appointed. - No. Here's what we'll do. Okay? - If you could just… - Maybe if you checked the file… - If you could please wait outside, then… - I mean... - The thing is... Wait for your turn and then we can talk. It's all I can offer. - It's a pressing matter. - Sorry, that's none of my concern. - Look, the mother may lose custody. - Yes, I understand. - Then we'll have a big problem. - That's none of my business, sir. You know full well I can't do what you're asking. - Please, I'm asking you a favor. - And I'm asking you to leave, please. - If you just checked the file… - But... I can't share any confidential information or... - Oh, don't bullshit me. - I'm not bullshitting you. Okay? - I'm not disrespecting you... - Miss Luisa. - One moment, please. I'm just asking you… - Sorry, Manuela. Give me a sec. - Just let me know if she's in a shelter. - I'm asking you to leave. - That'd be of great help. Please. - Look, you're in my workplace and you're disrespecting me. Will you go or should I call security? - Please. It'll take you a minute... - Will you go or should I call security? I'm just asking you to take a minute and check the file. It's not that hard. Just tell me if they took her to a shelter or… Pedro, I need you here. Fucking hell. - Goodbye, sir. - Bye. Fuck! Hey, your friend Luisa's very nice. She just threw me out. Please, call me… Forget it, I'm on my way. Fuck, the keys. Sorry to ask you this, but that Luisa bitch wouldn't listen to me. She's not a bitch. She just does her job well. Okay… - Did you read it? - Come in. Listen. It all happened unexpectedly. The police responded to a report and found the girl alone. I guess they were stealing power and a neighbor reported them. The child has a history with us, with Social Services. - School issues. - Why? The mother was summoned multiple times to meet with the teacher and social worker, but always failed to show up. She was probably scared to lose custody. Maybe. Or maybe she just didn't care and neglected the child. We don't know. Helena, I swear, she's a good mother. Well, if the great Rafa says so… Look, the girl was alone when the police found her. She cut her hand and couldn't recall the last time she saw her. Hand me some paper, please. Maybe she was working or has multiple jobs. I don't know. "I don't know"? We must protect the child, Rafa. Right. Where is she now? At the Isabel Clara Eugenia Children's Shelter. - What? - Have you requested guardianship? Not yet. But unless the mother shows up tonight, someone will, and the girl will have to stay there. That'll be up to the shelter's director. Oh, come on. That's how you'll help her? Taking her from her mother and sending her to a shitty shelter? - It's not a shitty shelter. - Shit, Helena, you're always saying that. There's no staff, no programs, they're overcrowded… - She's better off with her mother. - There's no mother, she's not around. Can you tell me where she is? I don't see her anywhere. I don't know, but we'll have to find her, speak to her… - Speak to her? - Yes. Fuck, it's your job. Fuck, it's your job. To deal with the specific case and not just follow a template. - You treat all cases the same. - We get the worst crap, Rafa. We get people who have nothing. All we can do is help them fight the anxiety, because we can't offer them work. We have no medicines, houses, nothing. We're just a patch. When we get a case like your friend, all we can do is protect the minor, which is what I'm doing. Don't tell me how to do my job. No. No. And I can't find the folic acid. In the blue box. Sorry. - You get so earnest. - Sure, but… - I have to give it back. - What? - Did you get the phone? - Yes. - Give me a kiss? - No. Give me a kiss, go on. Did Raúl go off happy? Yes, very happy. See you at 6, okay? I'm busy. I wanted to tell you… Do you mind if…? I can't believe it. Why do I get my hopes up? I'm an asshole. - Let me explain, please. - I knew it. What I mean is… - Hi. - How are you? …Instead of meeting here, we meet at the hospital. - So I can finish everything… - You know what I say…? - If you don't want to, don't. - Honey, I do. - You decide if it's important to you. - I do. I'll be there. I just mean at 7 at the hospital so I can finish everything, turn off my mobile and that's it. Never mind. I'll come here. Don't worry. Don't be late and don't make me wait outside the hospital. Give me a kiss. Ciao. Badia, when you're done there, clean the other area, okay? Alright. The number you are calling… - How did it go? - Good. What's this? You were here. Didn't you say anything? - It's not my problem. - Fuck, man. - What did you say about me? - You were smoking dope. Go ahead, joke. Isn't the test today? - Yes. - What's it for? To find out if the baby's alright. Is it dangerous? - It's invasive, but… - Right, but it's dangerous. No. There is a tiny risk, but no, not really. Right. - Where will you put me? - What? Weren't you taking the afternoon off to be with her? Unless I get in the wardrobe, I don't know what you'll do with me. I don't know. We'll see. - How do you know we're meeting up? - I heard you arguing last night. There was no way to sleep. We tried not to make any noise. I always hear you. I don't know what you heard or what you think is going on between us, but I love your mother. I love her a lot. Sometimes it's hard to see eye to eye, but I love Helena a lot. - When is my birthday? - What? When is my birthday? - Because…? - When? March 12th, right? - No. - No? A 7-year-old girl going to school every day alone isn't normal, and she smells as if she hasn't bathed in a week. - So we called the educator. - Did they never meet with her? Did they never ask to meet so she could explain? We sent loads of letters, but they were sent back to us. I doubt she even looked at the emails. Then we notified Selma… José, this is for inspection. But the mother missed the meetings. - Why? - You tell me. Sorry, but I have to cover the dining room. Of course. I'll go with you. So, you'd say that Selma is a neglected child? I don't know. Look, I've seen everything: From parents who hit their kids, mothers who neglect them, prostitutes who have no time to take care of them… Before, we had a lot more staff, auxiliaries that allowed us to forestall things. Now we have enough with the classes, the syllabus… I pass the buck to Social Services. - You don't know where the mom is? - I have no idea. - Has Selma said nothing? - Not as far as I know. - Nothing? - Sorry, I have to go to work. Of course. Thanks a lot. You have to be at court at 6 to sign the papers. Your wife? Do you owe money to someone? Russian mafia cut out your tongue? Is that why you're mute? No. - So…? - What? Your phone's rung tons of times and you put it away without answering. My mother. Really? You don't answer your mother? It's complicated. Did she throw acid on your face when you were a boy? Did she lock you in the basement and sing Nazi hymns? My mother's a saint. The only reason to not answer your mother's call is when you're fucking or watching football. - Otherwise, you're a dirty rat. - Hey, thanks a lot. - So? - What? - What's your mom's secret? - It's not my mother. It's me, I screwed up big time. And to fix it you decided to never answer her calls? - Well… - No, it's a great idea. I bet your old lady's happy. A great strategy. Piss off. And here I am, bro', working for 4 euros an hour. This is shit, for sure. Manuel. Germán. Luis… Germán, it's Mom. I don't know if you hear these messages, but I'll carry on. I need to talk to you urgently, son. C'mon, Raúl, grab it there. - No way. - Come on, don't shit me. Grab it there, my back's bad this morning. - That's your problem. - Fuck! Man, have a heart, the girl needs help. Ah! The girl's problem is my lack of heart now. - No, I didn't say… - Sure. - Grab it there, go on, man. - 10 bucks. - What? - 10 bucks and I'll help you. - Okay, go on. - No, no, the cash first. Fuck! Okay. - March 21st. - What? - Your birthday. March 21st. - No. Yes. We drove to the mountains, it was spring, nice weather. - No. - No? No. Yes, there was a river and you slipped. It had to be March, they were debating the Citizen's Initiative on housing. It's here. - What did I give you? - Don't you remember? A book? You really don't remember? A book, right? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Seriously? Seriously. Right. Don't you have keys? What are you going to do now? Grab it there. - What the fuck… - Help me, please. It's a favor for someone who needs it. Please. On three, okay? Come on. No one's coming. Come on. One, two, three. Let go. What are you doing? I'm calling the police. Yes… Hello. How are you? I'm Badia el Hataui's lawyer. Listen, this is good for me, because we're preparing the citizenship papers and, as you know, we have to prove residency. This is my lawyer ID. We're asking neighbors for any story or anything about her. I don't deal with those people, sorry. - Anything could help us. - I barely know her. But you must've run into her. On the landing… The woman upstairs knew her, she was Arab too. She minded the girl in the afternoons, but she moved two months ago. - She minded the girl? - Until night-time, but she's gone. The mother knows what she's doing, because she always arrived late, when she did come, of course. She hasn't been around for a few days. Okay, okay. Thanks a lot. Don't get cold. Bye. This is top quality. This hake is a real gem. Dinner with your son? No, he works in London and they never let him rest. That's a good sign. In these times, having a job is great. Here, I'll put it here. He's doing well. Or so he tells me every day. If he calls, he's a good son, Teodora. Listen, do you know how to take a video on this phone? Let's see… Let's see. You hit here. You hit the red button. The numbers run, now you're recording. - How do I stop it? - Hit it again and that's it, it's recorded. - It doesn't look very hard. - No. I'm crying with rage! Why are they doing this? We're not criminals! This is our home! This is our home! - Careful, eh? - I need time to get my things out and a few people, please, help me. They're at it! They're going to get in. They're going to get in. They're going to get in. You're not alone, we're with you! Azucena? Azucena! Do you mind staying back today? I need you at the checkout. - Yes. - Are you alright? - What are you looking for? - Something that tells us where she works. - Rafa. - What? Is this the mother? Yes. Look, lad, I'm telling you to get out of the car. Come on, out, out. We're working. Go home, you mother's about to arrive. It's cold here. Can we go? Come on, let's go. I just want to talk to him for one minute. I know, but I've been calling and calling. Sure, I'll wait, but don't leave me on that machine again. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? - Excuse me, is it moving fast? - Yes, it's moving. - Hi. - How are we doing? - More or less. - I heard it's tomorrow. At 7. Can you come? - Yes, count on it. - Thanks a lot. Look, take three of rice, - one of chickpeas… - No, they use loads of gas. They take ages to cook. Need anything else? Sanitary pads? Sorry, no pads left. That's okay. - So, see you tomorrow? - Yes, count on me. See you later. See you tomorrow. Thanks. SCHOOL Hello? Good afternoon. I think I spoke to your before. I got cut off… Listen. I need you to see me this afternoon. Now, the end of the day, anytime. I'll come around. Yes, said that before. Can you put yourself in my place? Do you want me to go there and scream about you putting a family out on the street? Out on the street with a minor? Do you want me to do that? At least listen to me. Hello? Hello? What do you want with my coat? I'll have a fit. What do you want? Can't you see I'm talking? Look at the state of you. What do you want? Will you use words, please? Have you forgotten how to talk? What are you asking? Use words. Ask me. - What if you don't find her? - We'll find her. Yes, but if not? There's no "if not." Is it that important? What do you mean…? I mean for you, to drop everything for this. You don't really gain anything. - Is it worth it? - I've been calling you all day. You'd do the same thing. Hi, Luis. This is my son Raúl. - Stepson. - Nice to meet you. Angélica Puig Correa called. She wants to know how your thing's going. - No, no, I wouldn't. - Yes, of course you would. Miguel Esparza called too, about the assessor. - If there was a date… - You would. - Wasn't Esparza on Thursday? - No, it's tomorrow. Everyone wants to know if you'll be at the law firm coop on Friday. I wouldn't ruin my life for anyone. Not if you don't see it. But when you do, you have no choice, you're involved. The problem's when you act dumb and look away, like almost everyone. - Jorge wants you to know… - That this is my living, I know. - Okay, okay. - I take this, right? - That's it. - Okay. Your mom remarried and you beat up the new husband. What a drag. No. - You stole money for drugs. - No. She caught you with a dude and you couldn't tell her you're gay. Moms understand everything. God, will you shut up? I just can't believe you won't answer your mother's calls. Do you know how far away mine is? Do you know what I'd give just to hug her? Who are you? Mr. Perfect? The perfect son, the perfect husband… The perfect everything? I'm a shitty dad, son, and husband. But I always answer my mom's calls. My mother… My parents, actually. They helped me out. I… I took over a business. They didn't give much thought to it. My mother seemed to be more excited than me. Then, well… You just can… fill in the blanks. All this shit happened, it all came crashing down and… we couldn't make ends meet. I honestly don't know what to say to her right now. I've screwed up her life enough. The farther away I stay from her, the better. Just give her a call. She'll forgive you. God, you're so weird, you dumb Argentine… Seriously, moms forgive everything. Shit, man. Couldn't I have been stuck with some Ecuadorian? Ecuadorians sing all day. You could just sing and drop the therapy thing. - What do you mean? - Shit, I wish you were Bolivian. The three main electricity companies increased their net profits to 6534 million euros in 2021. Therefore, 2021 became the year in which consumers were hit with the highest power rates in history. The combined net profit of the three companies, 6534 million euros, is the second highest figure in the last ten years, only surpassed by the 7126 million they earned in 2014. Percentagewise, the highest increase was in December, when rates rose by 470%… Hi. After what happened the other day, when they didn't let us in and kept us at the door... - I need to talk to you. - Wait. - What we both... - It's urgent. God, Rafa, give me a minute. After what happened during the visit, if anything happens to you, file a complaint, inform us, and we'll discuss it at the meeting next week. It's vital that we do this for the sake of the report. Firstly, we may lose our houses. That would leave us facing housing emergency, since we'd have nowhere to go. That's one problem. The other one is we'd be stuck in debt forever. Honey, go play with the other kids. I need to talk to Paty. Come on. Even if they take our houses, the bank keeps us indebted for life. We'll have to keep paying. Here at the PAH, we came up with two alternatives. One is for them to accept dation in payment. The other one is to resort to social housing. - Thanks. - Bye. God, Rafa, the day you're not in a rush the world will actually end. Remember Badia? Rental eviction, Olmo Street? "Hi, Alejandra, how are you?" "I'm fine, Rafa. You?" - Okay. Hi. - Yes, she had a sick father. - No, a six-year-old girl. - I don't remember her. What's wrong? They took the kid this morning and she may lose custody. I need to find her today. - I don't know anything. - Fuck. - Sorry, this is my son Raúl. - Stepson. Nice to meet you. - You too. - No idea. - So who might know? - I don't know. Olmo Street, you say? Paty took care of that area. I can ask her. Anything helps. Okay. Also, I need you to stay with Raúl while I go see Helena. We have an appointment with the doctor. - Yeah, of course. - You sure? - Yeah. - I can take care of myself. I'm not a kid. But it's better if you stay with Alejandra. Alejandra, we need you. We've started the meeting. Coming. Coming. Go, Rafa. No worries. - Thanks. - Go, Rafa. - Jeez, your father's stressful. - Stepfather. - Have you ever been to a meeting? - No. Come along. - What happened? - Paty, sorry, - I wanted to know if you told everyone. - Everyone. I called a lot of people, but I don't have all the numbers. Sit down. We've called everyone. You know there are new people? Of course. Everyone will be there. How are you? Awful, I've had this thing right here all day… - Listen to me… - If it all goes sour, we have a place, right? Sure, we have a place. But just in case… - Are you sure? - I'm sure. There'll be no need, because we will stop this. For sure. How's Diego? Good. Well, I don't know now. He hasn't spoken for a month. The teacher says he hasn't at school either. Nerves, stress, all this. Poor kid found out everything. Right. I've done everything wrong. No, you haven't, not at all. This isn't your fault. I've spent all day thinking about that bitch at the bank who said they'd take my boy away if I was out on the street. They say it to scare you. That's never happened and never will. How could it all turn out so bad? Listen… Look, let's do this… I'll go with you to your place and stay the night so you're not alone. Let's do that now. Let's go. Come on. No, Paty, there's no need. Manuel might come, and these things, he doesn't… - Are you sure? - Thanks a lot. - We'll talk later, okay? - Okay. EMERGENCIES Come on! I bought my flat when I was 30 and 10 years ago I decided to be my daughter's guarantor. HOW'S THE EXCURSION? They auctioned it off and I've had it so rough. I retired due to depression. I'm having an awful time. I underwrote for 20%, not 100%. And, well, I won the case, which is the good thing, due to abusive clauses. And the judge filed the case, but… since they sold it off again to a vulture fund, the fund wants both residences. First, welcome to the PAH, the mortgage victims platform. We're all here and we'll do everything possible to stop it. It's important that all the documents reach you, and what you have, bring it to the next assembly and we'll check it together, okay? To add something and comment… When they told us it's 20%, well, it's not 20%. They tricked us and we're not guarantors, we're the debt holder. That's what happened to Mati, who ended up being the debt holder. That's why they took her house, which she'd paid for, and her daughter's as well. We have to look at Asun's case. She went to Social Services today, and it'd be good if we organized people to go with her. What do you think, Asun? You went alone today and it seems that they're not seeing you. Well, friends, I have an imminent eviction and the social worker has to give me a paper. - I go there and no one sees me. - What paper is this? The social report on my situation. I need it to stop the eviction. At any rate, Asun, if it happens again get help from the assembly so that one or two people go with you, so this social worker doesn't dodge you, to put on pressure. I asked to be accompanied and I got it. - Not today. - Yesterday, yes, not today. Alejandra, one task we have outstanding is to find out the new Social Services rule, because there are lots of families from almost all over Madrid from the assemblies, and they're flatly refusing the social report. There are a lot of women here, we're a majority in the PAH, women alone with our children. So we say: "Without us the evictions won't stop." Those who haven't experienced this can't imagine what it's like to live under the constant threat that they'll come to your house with the notification that they want you out on the street. You're not guilty. They'll always blame you. They even told me that what they were offering was a take it or leave it thing. Leaving it means being homeless. I looked at my little kids and said: "I can't be homeless with two kids." The day I was evicted, in January 2018, it was the first eviction in January. I'm going to cry my father got very sick, he was on death's door, and loads of people appeared at the door of the hospital to accompany me. I thank you because, thanks to you men and women, my parents have a roof over their heads right now. Yes indeed! Fuck. Come on, go, go, go. Come on, shit! Hold on… A tiny jab. DON'T COME. IT'S DONE No! - What did you study? - I started Philosophy, - then switched to Politics. - Did you like it? I had a fucking ball at university, playing cards, parties, boys, activism. Sure. I know what you mean. - What are you into? - I'm not sure, really. I only know that I'd like to have time. Time? As in…? I don't want to feel like things happen to me and I can't decide. I don't understand you. Some people decide to be a lawyer, right? And it's the last decision they ever make. All the rest is inertia, it rolls along. Like when a planet blows up and boom, into orbit. That's what it'll do until the end of the world. I don't want to orbit. Never mind, forget it. I can't explain myself. You explained it well, very well. I don't know. - I have to go now. - Ciao. We must do this again. You have to tell me more about this time thing. Yeah, sure. Ciao. How's my mother? We're going home. - Now? - Yes. What about the girl? I don't know. But I can't keep screwing up today. Right. We were meant to help her, to not stop until we found her, today was "hook or by crook," according to you. - Right. - You suck. Raúl! Fuck! Fuck! Raúl! - What the fuck…? - Nothing! Raúl… I screwed it up with your mother. I let her do the test alone. What do you want me to do? - Fine. Leave me alone! - Leave me alone, no. - Raúl, I tried. - Yeah, you tried so hard. - Shit, I tried. - You've never kept a promise! You go around promising everyone you'll sort out their life, but you're never there. You're never there for anyone! - I haven't been there for you. - I'm not talking about me. Now what will you do? Leave her in the lurch too? What the fuck. - It's what you always do. - What the fuck… Man… Even if I wanted to, I don't know where to look. I found this in her place. I don't know if it'll do. SOUP KITCHEN C'mon. Wait here, I'll be right back. Give me five minutes… On the street in January! You have daughters, right? Let's go. Are we keeping our home? I don't want to go. I know. I know you don't want to go. It'll all be fine, okay? It'll all be fine, you'll see. Here, yours. - More tomorrow. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Go see your mom. - You drag! Have you had dinner? No. I left you a plate there. I'll heat it up if you want. No, thanks. No need. - The boy's sleeping. - Sorry. It's all… It's all what? Nothing. There's your bag, where you left it. I waited for you at the bank this morning. Did you hear me? No, it turns out. In the end, this whole circus was for nothing, right? - Don't start. - You know I'm right. They're coming at 8 or before. All those rallies, all the shame you put us through, for nothing. What was that? Shame? How did I make you feel ashamed? - I don't want to argue with you. - Neither do I. Shame is you not coming with me one single time. That's shame alright. I didn't go? You came once, once. And you stood at the back. Then all you said to me was: "It's all bad, Azucena." You started to shout… They supported and encouraged me, and you: "Azucena, it's all bad." - Fine, fine. - Even Roberto, the Ecuadorian, hugged me. What was fat-ass going to say? "Fat-ass" helped more than you did. What good was all the support if they're throwing you out anyway? To realize that I was all alone. You care more about what some bank manager you don't know thinks of you than what might happen to your wife and son. - That's not true. - It totally is. - Weren't you ashamed of what he did? - What? Putting your son out on the street, no. But your wife shouting in public to defend what's yours, that was unbearable. Everyone was looking at you. It was pathetic. - You made a fool of yourself. - Why don't you piss off and leave me alone? If you'd listened to me, now at least… - Now at least what? - We could've started somewhere else. With what? My salary? We couldn't rent a basement. - We could have done something. - What? Throw away all we've put into this home, all the years of mortgage? We're throwing it away anyway. Don't you realize? You know what I realize? That we'll be homeless and you don't care. - What do you want me to do? - I don't know. Something besides getting mad at me - or going to the bar. - Where do you think I was all day? In this house for years we lived off my work. - My work. - And I don't work? You're playing the hero. You look at me with contempt every time I come home. - When did I do that? - Oh, please… - When did I do that? - Please, let's be honest. - You're crazy. What the fuck…? - When I got fired. Every time I came back from getting told I couldn't work, I'm too Argentinean, all of that, you'd look at me with disgust: "He can't get a job…" I've never looked at you like that. - Nor did you ask me. - I've never looked at you like that. Shut up, you'll wake him! - I did and you kept quiet. - Like I was a ghost… So I stopped asking you. Like it was my fault, my fault you didn't find a job, that you got fired. Jesus fucking Christ! You're so proud about "I talked to rallies. I've got lawyers." - I feel like garbage! - You should've done it! What did you do when the notification came? When the stack of papers came? Nothing. Remember when you didn't pick up Diego? I had to reject a job. The teacher looked at me like… You couldn't handle being my wife or Diego's mom. You swapped us for your shitty friends. I didn't swap you, you idiot. I was defending your home, what's yours. And you don't care. Tell me: How often did you take the boy to school, give him dinner, help him with his homework? What the fuck? You're a slacker! I was working, Azucena. That's what it's about. Working to keep your family, that's what it's about. I work, I provide for this family, you know that. And you fucking abandoned me. You left me completely alone. You'd come and wouldn't even say a word to me, good or bad. If I asked you anything, you'd give me a dirty look. If I asked you to go to a meeting, you'd give me a dirty look. You decided the house was my responsibility, so I went to the bank alone, learned about the mortgage process, spoke to the lawyer and applied for dation in payment alone. I did all that by myself. The only thing I needed? To be able to tell someone how scared I was. The fear I felt. The fear of failing, of being thrown out in the street, of something happening to me and that boy ending up on his own. Don't you get it? The fear of not… I don't know how to get out of this, I feel trapped. Fuck, I don't see a way out of this. Sometimes, fear won't let me breathe. And I can't say anything to you because it makes you mad. Well, I'm done, Manuel. I can't take it anymore. I'm taking pills, and you won't even lift a finger. No. In the end, I was right. We're on our own. Nobody will come and help just because. This was all in vain. Where are your friends from the PAH? Where are... Hey. What's up, champ? Come here. What is it? Did we wake you? Okay, let's go to bed now. Excuse me, sir. Have you seen this woman? How do we get there? Go straight on for two blocks and turn left. Two blocks and turn left. Okay. - The square, right? - Okay, thanks. - Do you know where I can find her? - She has morning shifts. No idea. I know she works here in the mornings, but does she have other jobs? I don't know. She just comes, cleans… I don't ask questions. You sure you don't know anything else? It's very important. That's all I know. Sorry. Thank you. - Hey, Alejandra. - Rafa, Paty told me she's been working at some joint. - Where? - 66 Fernández Arribias Street. - Are you sure? - Maybe she still works there. Okay. We're on our way. - Where's the car? - This way! Let's go, Azu. Let's go before they come. No. It's over, Azu. We lost. Well, let them kick me out. This is my house. I haven't lost yet. Manuel, it's our house. Go, I've got you! - Take that, another death! - Come on! Bastard! - You've died four times already. - You're cheating. You suck at this. There. - Good evening. - One moment, please. The lad can't go in. Is he a minor? - Wait here. I won't be long. - Okay. - Go in. - Thanks. - Excuse me, are you the owner? - No. I'm after a woman I'm told works here. Her name's Badia. It's important that I find her today. - This is her. Ring a bell? - No. - Mind if I ask the women? - Wait here. - What is it? - Some bald guy asking about… Who is he? - What's the problem? - No, no problem. I'm after a woman I'm told works here. Her name's Badia. She may lose custody of her daughter. It's important that I find her. No, she doesn't work here. - Are you sure? - I'm sure, I hire them. - Mind if I take a look…? - Unless you're drinking, I'll ask you to leave. Did you get a good look? It's important that I find her. I'm sure. She doesn't work here. - Thank you. - Good luck. Shit. What the fuck… What the fuck? Let's go. Fuck! Fuck this shit! - Rafa… - Fuck this shit! Move away. - Rafa… - Watch out, okay? Sir, what are you doing? - It's my car. - Drop the rock. It's my fucking car. The keys are inside, okay? - Drop the rock. - Rafa, stop! - It's my fucking car! - Sir, hands on the hood. Okay. - Fuck. - Fuck. Hi. - Are you a lawyer? - Yes. - Oh, nice work… - Lad… - I have to leave you. - Lad… Is this your father? - Yes, he's my father. - Okay. This is what we'll do. Sir, look at me, please. We should arrest you so that you calm down at the station, but… I'll ID you and they'll call you, okay? Okay, thanks. The car stays here. Delta 7 to Base 8. April the 3rd. - Yes. - Fuck, that took it out of me! What a shit day I've had. Well… You missed the excursion… Did you have any special plan? There's a girl I like and… I thought maybe on the trip… I don't know. Short girl, always wears earrings? At your birthday she talked to your mother all the time. Her? Yes. - What's her name? - Olga. Olga… - I've got a good eye. - Yes. Raúl, wait for me in the taxi. Helena. What are you playing at, Rafa? What the fuck are you playing at? I saw this girl get taken away by the police this morning. You found the girl. You happened to be on the street and you saw the girl. I wasn't on the street. I was taking them a gas tank because… - Yeah, a gas tank. - …they ran out, honey. And nobody else in the world could take care of it? Only you? Today? Today? - I'm sorry. - I'm tired, Rafa. I don't know what to do anymore. What do I do? I'm totally alone. Raúl and I are at the fucking bottom of your priorities. I asked you to do two things. To go with me to the hospital and to take Raúl to the excursion. You did neither. I tried, but it's been a crazy day. - See you later, cutie. - See you, good night. You couldn't put work aside for one day? You know it's important to me. This thing with the girl happened, otherwise… I would've made it. I tried. - You drag Raúl around all day. - I'm sorry I lied about Raúl. Rafa! It's Badia, she's there! - Raúl, one second. - She's there! - Are you sure? - I'm sure! They may take her girl away, honey. See you at home, okay? Mom! I told her you were a star. Your mother's right, Raúl. She's right. You're going to disappear, are you? I love you so much, squirt. Germán, son, how are you? I called you tons of times, but you didn't answer. I don't know why you want a phone. I don't know if your battery runs out, but it's impossible. I called Maite and everyone I thought could find you, some friends. I don't know where to start. I'm not telling you off, not at all, son. All I care about is that you're alright. And that… If you're alright, I'm alright, and I want to tell you that you shouldn't… feel bad, it's not your fault at all. That… I don't want you to feel bad, Germán. I'd have your back a thousand times if you asked me again. A thousand times. Your father and I… All we ever wanted was the best for you. You know that. Your father was so proud of you. He'd always tell me, "My son's just like me, huh?" "He really is like me." God, you're so like each other. Two peas in a pod. I want to tell you that I love you, that you're the best thing in my life, that I want you to live, that you have your whole life ahead of you… and that you deserve to be happy. I love you so much, Germán. I love you so much. So much. TO VOICE MESSAGE - MOM POLICE Germán, it's Mom. I need to talk to you as soon as possible. I… I'm going on a trip.

In the last ten years, over 400,000 evictions took place in Spain. At present, about 100 evictions are carried out daily. Being on the fringe Makes it hard to look after you If we lack warmth Who will keep us warm on this journey? If we have no food on the table What will give us strength? Who will give us hope? Who will give us every reason To clench our fists And knock down This stone wall? Let's get to it The path to follow Is once again tinged with darkness The flames of my fire Don't let us breathe The tide pushes the boat It gobbles up time The scales were tipped And we're about to blow our lids I think of a new method to appease fear Big fish eat small fish And only the fierce survive Only the fierce survive The despair in your eyes It's the same as mine Let's join forces There's strength in numbers Shout it! Life is not life If you have to struggle To make it through the day Fight! Make your voice heard It'll be louder with others by your side Feel it, you've got a brave soul Which always keeps on going With strength and dignity Shout it! Life is not life If you have to struggle To make it through the day Fight! Make your voice heard It'll be louder with others by your side Feel it, you've got a brave soul Which always keeps on going With strength and dignity
