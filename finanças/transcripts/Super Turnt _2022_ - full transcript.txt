What's going on, no! No, no! Let me go, please. Please. Please. Oh my god no! No! Please, please! What's going on? What's going on? No, no, no! No, no, not my baby! My god, no! Oh Lord, no! No, no! God! No! Jesus, help me please! Oh my god, please help my baby, Lord! Oh God! From Rikers to Atlanta. It's all the same. I spent five years in Rikers Island. Today I'm being transferred in a County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia to be released. So I thought it was cool until I ran into the man that killed my brother. And that shit came right back. Move it, inmate. Say, bro. Who the fuck is this nigga? Blood on my hands is his brother's. What's up, homie? They call me Rilla. I know who you is, big dog. Just call me E. That your little man? Yeah. Little soccer player, man. Shit, can't wait to get home to him. Prison's fucked up, big dog. My kids not come to see me a long time ago, man. You gotta get up outta here, man so you can get him straight. So he don't end up like me, you know what I'm saying? You keep you and him away from whatever got you here.

Ain't no need. Coz we gonna be there tomorrow! We have a developing story out of East Atlanta. Future rap star Rilla has been shot multiple times at the popular Turnt studios. Somehow he survived the attack only to be arrested hours later. Now we go to Bill who is on location. This is a very sad and unfortunate story because his brother wasn't so lucky. He too was gunned down earlier this year and was on the verge of becoming a rap superstar. Yes, this is very sad indeed, Bill. And it raises a very serious question.

You know these niggas know you gonna be out next week. And your rank. They're gonna protect Marcus. Fuck but none of that, you feel me? Nice to know. I'ma have to kill that nigga. Oh, big fella a problem? Say less. Fully loaded ENT. Fuck it, let's do it. You know, Russ told me about your brother. But Marcus is the money man here for a lot of people. He has to be greenlit. That ain't gonna happen. Mhmm. He make the wrong move, I send him up there with his brother. In here, it's the fist in the yard. Out there, it's a bang to the forehead. Like Nicki Minaj. My whole goal is to get home to my son.

You always was a real one. You taught me that. Let me look out for you, and let your enemies become mine. You the one that made me go back to Ladonna. And I appreciate you for telling me that. You was telling me right. You made me want love. For the first time my mind was clear. And I owe you for that. I'm sorry I ain't come to see you. I just didn't want to see you locked up. Pssh, it's all good, it ain't shit. Only been five years. But I knew you'd come around one day. Oh nah, you know I don't do handouts. Oh, no no no, this ain't no handout. Now I love your ass but you're gonna have to go through the same shit as everybody else. I wanna sign you to the double R with a contingency that you place in Turnt this season. You know your brother-in-law, well, your ex brother-in-law Cortney, he running it now. I ain't no rapper, Rita. Yeah I did see that. He deserve it. I mean, you don't have to be a rapper, Rilla. You just have to take care of your family, that's it. I mean you lost everything. I didn't lose everything. My mama did. For chasing the sun for that rap shit. She died from the coronavirus. That put me in a deep place mentally. So by the time I was being transferred, I was happy, I was on my way to see my son. Then I seen this nigga face, and all that shit came back to me. So right now to be honest with you, Rita, I might not make it out this bitch. Wait a minute, you're telling me the nigga that killed Kenny is in here? Let's go, Stanford. Rilla, look, he gonna die in here, you not. Do you hear me? Rilla! Get your mind right and stay focused. You're not gonna die in here, you're getting out of here, do you hear me?! Bones, motherfucker. Fuck, man. Fuck! Hey, what's up, you good, big dog? My card ain't working. Oh, shit, the one from Rikers? Yeah. Oh yeah, they canceled Speedcom. They gave us some new shit. Everybody all fucked up right now though, big dog. - Ain't close. - Straight up. I ain't been able to use my phone this whole year. Yeah, me neither. Who you trying to call? What the fuck you mean? Chill out, bro. On the plug. I'm getting my dude out. You got a line? Yeah, I do. All right, come on, pop. Take the cares. I'll get a glass of white wine please. - Si. - Thank you. Vino blanco. Ola. Ola, Maggy. This guy's gonna give you and ready. You call and give his message. Si, bueno. What's the number? Appreciate you. Hello? 448553013. Hello? Ladonna? Who's calling? Hello? Yeah, it's me. Yeah they moved me from Atlanta. Oh that's good, is it better? Yeah. The whole compound know the only person that got a line out was Jimenez and his wife. You know me, I'm staying out the way. So they watching him. Which means they watching me. But I'm ready. What's up with Kevin? Oh, my dad went to go pick him up from school. Oh, okay. Let me know- You ain't good here, nigga. And you sit or get your big head ass knocked down. Hello? Hello? My mans already smoked your ho ass brother. Fuck is you talking about? I'm gonna kill this nigga! Get the fuck down, get the fuck down! All right, need assistance. Back off, back off. Lock it down! - Rilla, you straight bro? - Man down, man down. Mommy, mommy! - Mommy! - Kevin, where are you? It's time for dinner and mommy can't find you. I'm in here. What? Kevin, come here. What did I tell you about playing in there? It's dangerous and you could get hurt. If I didn't hear you calling for me you would have been gone, what would have happened? And I would be gone forever? You don't wanna be away from mommy, do you? No. You're mommy's boy? Always. Oh, come here. All right, listen, go wash your hands and get ready for dinner, okay? Hey, baby girl. One hand, I can't be more proud of you. Even downright amazed. Mm, what's on the other hand? The way you take care of that boy as your own, that's amazing. But... Dad, like I told you before, Kevin is a part of Labarius. All right, I loved him. You would do the same thing for mom. Yeah, but we were married. Plus your mother was no drug dealing murderer and damn sure wouldn't be in anybody's prison, away from you in the first place. I don't think he actually killed anybody. He just has this, like street persona. Besides, when he was good, things were great. I doubt that. What about his real mother? I'll raise she's worse than him. Hey, you wash them good? Yes, ma'am! Pizza, pizza, pizza! Let's go, boy. Look, you can't give so much of yourself that you don't have enough for yourself. Don't you want a child of your own? What are you trying to do? Love you. ♪ It comes too low ♪ ♪ Something about the way things end up ♪ Damn, you smoking without me? What's wrong with you? First of all, I almost lost my brother today. He was almost killed in prison. Besides this music, he's all I got in this world. What you mean? You got me. Got you? You have a son that I don't even know. And I feel like you hiding something from me. But you love me, right? Yes. Okay, look. I have a son. His name is Kevin, and he's six. I lost custody of him. Think about him all the time. His father's bitch got him. That's the only reason why I came back. Now fuck all that. When your brother get out? He actually out tomorrow. I can't wait to see him back in the studio. Will you take me to pick him up? Yeah, anything you want, baby. Thank you. And I'm sorry about your son. I know what that feels like. Me and my brother was taken away from my mom when we were kids. But she never came back. So, Jugg raised me, taught me how to rap, and everything else in this life. Yeah, but you know, there's always room for new teachers. You know how prison work, nigga? It's like a ecosystem. Things run a certain way. OG, I ain't worried about none of them niggas. You know how I made it this long? By staying out the way. But I stay in line of the bullshit that's going on here. Now, you know you got a problem with dude out there. But that was out there. In here, he the money man. What that mean though, I'm saying- - Like I said. It's not just the inmates. That man money run all through the compound. Somebody gotta replace that. Everybody in the compound know you ain't kill him. But the COs feel like that you sent the unauthorized hit and for that, they don't want you in here. I ain't worried about them, homie. Sorry to bring that shit to your cell though. Nah, nah, don't worry about me. They know how I get down. I'm solid. You really gotta watch out for these young motherfuckers trying to pull rank though. See, you new here. So I'ma show you all the pockets so you can get home to your son, nigga. After that, ain't nothing I can do. Yeah, I respect it, yeah. So you the one that turned my sister out, huh? Nah, I'm just playing, Zina, right? Yep, Zina Holloway. You must be doing something right. 'Cause she happy and that's all I give a fuck about. I am. But we should take you to a hospital. Fuck, no. This nigga killed Faze last night. You talking about Faze? The nigga that owned Fully Loaded? Yeah, yeah, a beef with some ho ass nigga that entered the compound this week. Some bitch ass nigga named Rilla. Ooh, bullshit. You know this nigga? Yeah, Faze, he killed his brother years ago. Plus that's my baby daddy. But when I see him, he's on sight. So this nigga owe you child support or something? Nah, total opposite. He made me lose my child. I pulled like 20 bodies for him. I did all his dirty work. Soon as I had to go away, he turned his back on me. I ain't seen my son in five years. I don't have no idea how to find him. Well what about his girl? Didn't you say she had him? I mean we gonna run into that goofy bitch sooner or later. What's her name? Ladonna or some shit. Yo, that's it right there! Turn around! For what? This the shit we looking for, turn it around. Where the fuck is the phone log? Where the fuck is the log at? Your husband called from prison yesterday. I need that log. Shut up. Got that bitch. And you better not say shit 'cause I will be back. Ass bitch. Find it, baby. What you gonna do? We need to kill that bitch. Faze was like my motherfucking brother. I wanna make this motherfucker feel it. Find the address. Hold, not right now, not right now, my son in there. I'm trying to stay out the way so I can get outta here. But I almost lost that chance yesterday. I ain't seen my girl Ladonna and my son in five years. She's been taking care of him since I've been in prison. She a real one. What happened to your hand? Is that why the phone cut off? Don't tell me you've been in here fighting and you about to get out. When is this gonna end? I mean when are you gonna grow up? I ain't trying to hear that shit right now. You know what, it's all about you. Everything is about you. You don't give a fuck about nobody but you! I know I put you through a lot. But I love you and my son. Yeah, I doubt that. You don't think I wanted to have your child? But I would not want to have a child who's not gonna have a father, a family! I thought we were gonna get married. But your past came back with you and it sure as hell came back with me. I give your son the love that he needs. Love that you ain't never give nobody. What you came down here to beat me up? Huh, that's what you came down here to do? I told you when I get out of here, I'ma take care of my family. That's what I'm talking about. If you cared about your son, you would never have him around drugs and shit! I love my son. I wouldn't put him in a situation like that. This is legit business. I don't know how you expect me to believe either one of those. You don't even know. Rita Robinson want to sign me. I mean I didn't know better. But I guess it's a start. You wanna bring Kevin to see me next week? Yeah, he wanna be here when you get out. He has a surprise for you. Time, Stanford.

You understand, that's bad, you dig? No more of that. Yeah? Straight soccer. We cool with that? Yes. Okay, what type of position you play? Striker. Striker? What does a striker do? I just kick the ball real hard. But I keep slipping and falling because my shoes are old and not good. Oh, no wonder why you keep falling. Uh-uh, we gonna have to fix that. The next game, I'ma have some new shoes. We gonna fix that, right? Yeah, but it's today. That was his surprise. I was gonna tell you when we got in the house. Oh, man, that's wonderful. First day home and I get to watch my son kick butt? Yeah, let's go! Mr. Denver? She's here. Great, great. Have a seat. Thank you. Thanks, Valerie. So, Cortney mentioned you wanted to speak with me personally so I immediately cleared my schedule. Yes, thank you so much for taking the time. My pleasure. As you know, things can get pretty busy around here whenever we start a new season. Yes, the industry is in an uproar waiting for the winner of Turnt every season. So let me ask you this, how many seasons has it been on air? My wife and I founded it back in 96. Wow, congratulations. Thanks. You know, we had to make a few adjustments because of the pandemic. But we're still going strong. And I tell you what, the streaming and virtual events, now king. Yes. The internet is where it's at. That's actually the reason why I wanted to take a meeting with you. Do you remember Labarius Stanford, AKA Rilla? I sure do. How could I forget? He was shot on our property a few years back. Please don't tell me you're here to discuss that young man. Actually, I am. Artists like him make your show. Your audience tunes in to see people like him because that's who they can relate to. That's true. But you do know our ratings hit an all time low after that event took place. And you know, the fact he went to prison right after caused us to lose sponsors left and right. Truthfully, it hurts the other contestants more than it hurts the show. Well I can't argue with you on that. I mean this show has been a backbone for many artists since I started my record label. In fact, my most successful artist started on Turnt. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the hip-hop genre has a lot of fans and I think that you should think about bringing it back. I can't promise you that. But I can promise I'll think about it. I have a question. Shoot. Why is this so important to you? We all know Rita Robinson only signs female artists. Is this a chess move, you're looking to sign your first male artist? You can't ask me to take a risk if you're not ready to. Mr. Denver, do you know why my record label is so successful? No. Because all my risks will be lower than my counterparts. Because you leave everyone else to take the risks? No, because I take them when others don't. You have a nice day, Mr. Denver. Your daddy's still here? No, he at the airport. Oh man, I thought he'd be retired by now. Shoot, he still hate me? No, this his last year at Delta. And yeah, he still hates you. Are you going to sleep in mommy's room too? Son, what you mean? You six years old, you still sleeping with your mama? No, my uncle sleeps in there sometimes but I have my Spiderman bed in my own room. Mmm, you just get ready for the game. Okay. All right. It's not like that. Jan, look. I need to hold the keys to your car. Aren't you gonna make it to his game? Of course. I got something to do. What you need to do just went in the house. No, what I gotta do is take care of my damn son. So let me.

When all that shit fell apart, hate to say it but she don't want this no more. You know, I tried to stick around but it was, I can dig it, bro. I understand death. My mama died, she just lost it. She's the one that took it the worst. It was tough on here. But... Rita told me to give you this. She got a package for you. Your CD, My Brother's Keeper has been streaming for five years nonstop. So there's a check in there. Streaming, what's that? Well, it's like buying a record but you just listen to it on your phone. Check it out. Yeah, let's see. Oh, man. - Right. - Rita, mm. She really fucking with you, bro. Yeah I see. I appreciate you though, bro. Real talk, holding it down for me. I don't trust a lot of people with Ladonna, to take care of my family. But I trust you. Like I said, there's a lot of people, back then, that was really rocking with you. But today, it's Rita. Like she really fucking with you, dog. She put all this shit together. I'm about to go see her right now. You do that. - All right, bro. - All right. You be easy. All right, holla at you. I spent my whole life jeopardizing my freedom, putting myself and family in harm's way. My brother lost his life behind me. After he died, I promised that I was gonna keep his dream alive. Which I did. But I wasn't no rapper. All I knew was the streets. So I wasn't gonna rest till I got revenge. I surrounded myself with real killers. This is blood here, this physical form. Put that shit up. I was blinded by fake loyalty. I knew the game. You die by what you live by. But you know what the hardest thing for me was? She raised me way better than this. Now you call that motherfucker, and tell him his days are numbered. You fuck with my family, I fuck with yours! And she deserved more from me. But I'm gonna make it right this time. Mama.

So now you see why I had to go get him, right? I see why you got your man out of jail. Get away from him, get away from him. That's it, you got it, Kevin. Kick it! Go, go, go, kick it! - Good job Kevin, good job! - Good job! Is he the best on his team? He might be, that's his first goal. Oh yeah? His first one, hasn't scored one yet. I guess it's 'cause you here. Oh, no. Look. I know I pushed through a lot of things but I got you. I'll get you a new house, new car, all that. We can get back to where we was at. Look.

I scored! Did you see me? Yeah, we seen you, you did wonderful. Hey man, nice meeting you. I just wanted to come by and tell you thank you for the donation to the team. Parents really appreciate it. Yeah, that's what's up. You'll see a lot more of me. Man, we look forward to it. - Good job, Kevin. - Good job, man. Hey man, I see that win, dog. You rocked that joint huh? Good job. How'd he do? He scored a goal. Wow. Amazing. Maybe because his father decided to show up. Amazing what kids can accomplish when their father's in their life. Daddy, please. Look, here, baby. Go in the house and get ready for dinner, okay? Take that, will you? He don't know what a real father supposed to do. Real father stays in the child life until their last day on earth, no matter how old they get. See, I'm a real father. I had your child in my home for five years. And you stand here with all this fancy shit on like you're supposed to be somebody, but you ain't shit to me. It takes a real man to be a real father. All you wanna do is just be a real nigger. Imagine somebody did this to your child. Daddy, please, just... Dad, just go. Look, I am so sorry about that. Nah, it's cool. He right. Sat down for five years and thought about that. But I ran into Cortney. Wait, Cortney? Like you seen Cortney? Yeah. What'd he say? Is everything good with y'all? Yeah, everything's wonderful. He's 100. He did what he say he was gonna do. So we can get up out of here ASAP. Wait. Labarius. I told you, I don't want that no more. I've given you enough. Right. Kevin. Yes, Daddy? Wait, who is that? Rita Robinson. You know what, why don't you take your son with you? Listen. Daddy will be back, couple of days. Gonna get the house you wanted, right? With a big swing set and a swimming pool? Yeah. Let me see your phone. For what, you ain't got no business in there. Let me see your phone. Now look. You call me anytime you need me, you see that? This is your special ringtone. There's Daddy. So use this so Daddy know that you calling. I'ma make a store run real quick. A'ight well don't be too long 'cause we gotta get outta here. A'ight. So you must be the boss. Excuse me? I'm Rita Robinson, and you are? I'm Mr. Henry, Ladonna's father. I know who you are. The only female music producer in the business. I have a question. Why would a woman, a black woman who so-called cares about her people affiliate herself with a man that don't give a fuck about his son, let alone a black man? I would think that given the current state of the black man in America that you would identify with Rilla. Ha ha, I see. You in love with him. Just remember. The heart fools the mind. They say your past will creep up on you when you least expect it. There was a reason why Zina Holloway was on my team. She's a killer. But her soft spot is kids. Fuck! Then out the blue I see Russ. - Homeboy. - What's up, homie? When the hell you get out? What's going on with you, man? Your girl with you? Man, ain't shit, boy, how you been, man?

Man, I almost had this nigga! Really, what you mean you almost had? He had another nigga with him. And? There was kids out there! See, that's the difference between me and you. I don't give a fuck when kids are around or who they belong to. If they in the way, then they just in the way. And I thought you was a killer. Listen here.

We can't act like it's cool. It's not, it's actually fucked up. You know he came to see me today. I looked this man in his eyes after five years and guilt hit me. All right, well you think I don't feel bad? When do we get to live our lives? When can it be about us? Rilla's living his. Look, I just can't turn this off. I love you, Cortney. You love me? Yeah. You sure? I can't tell. Maybe here too much. All right, I love you too. Just making sure. But I know Rilla. At this time, Ad, things is what they is, I think we need to leave this alone. We have to. Well, I think that it's a little late for that. Oh, shit. Well. Guess we're gonna have to figure it out. - Okay. - You wanna figure it out? Yeah. Okay. What up though? How are you today, my brother? I'm doing good. You must have made your mind up. Well, yes. Rita obviously knows her shit so I'm inclined to agree, but, my only quirk is that this is a family show. And if any bullshit breaks out I will have no choice but to permanently ban artists like this from my show and I will hold you fully responsible. Do you understand? Oh yeah, I understand. - You know- - Cortney. Are you sure you want to put your whole career on the line for this guy? People like this will always screw good people over. Yeah, that's true but, you know sometimes good people will screw people over too. Talk to you later. Just give me the tracks and the beat, you know what we gonna do, right? Come on, bro. - I got you. - Absolutely. All right, well listen, we need at least one of them to be a hit. So I'm locking you and Thriller in the studio all day tomorrow. And as soon as Cortney get here, we just gonna go over the rest. And here is your contract. You can have your lawyer take a look at that. If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to give me a call. My phone always on. You can get that back to me right now. Hey, what up though? You all right? Ah, yeah, I'm good. - I'm good. - You know, you the only person I know that say "What up though?" Yeah well, where I'm from everybody say it, so... But look, I gotta quick out so I'ma get right to it. First thing is I had to pull some strings as y'all probably imagine to get this done. So we gonna get y'all on the next upcoming show, okay? Bro, the judges were reluctant to do this because they know I used to manage you. And they scared about violence, okay? But look, the good thing is if y'all pick the right song and kill it, the world is yours. The world is ours. - Yes. - Right? Right. So we had Kenny here, we had you here before. So the time is now. All right, and what's the bad news? Well, well, well, the bad news is, if something do happen, they gonna fire me and they gonna ban rap music from the show. Point blank, no questions, over. All right, well check this out, that's not gonna happen. So you can dead that, we ain't even thinking like that. - Dead. - Right. Okay. So y'all give it up for my boy Rilla.

I mean us as black people we gotta fight 10 times harder dealing with this institutional racist bullshit.

Hey baby, mommy's right here, mommy and daddy, okay? The prosecutor watched the video on Zina's phone. And seeing that I wasn't the one that killed Jugg or his sister, so they dropped all charges. And who do you think was waiting on me? Yup, Rita. This woman ain't never turn her back on me or act fake with me. If anything, she pushed me to be better. Ladonna's a beautiful woman. Always be mama's baby, right? But she outgrew me a long time ago. It's time for her to live her life. I have never seen Ladonna this happy before. Cortney's a good dude and I know he gonna treat her good. Kevin is gonna live in LA with me and Rita and Rita's son Johnny. As far as me rapping, well I ain't ever been no rapper. But the wierdest thing happened. Do that one more time. Rita still worked her magic and finally got her first male artist to go number one. That's right, my son.
