You cheated on me. - I didn't. - Yes you did. You cheated and you lied. - No. - Say it! - I cheated. - And you lied. - And I lied. - And you're sorry. - Tyler, please.

Pinot and cabernet. And it's organic. It is one of my favorites. - Wow. - Yeah. - How do you know so much about wine? - Oh, greg didn't tell you? I have an online wine business. Hence the wine. (chuckling) - that's impressive. - Aw, that's so sweet. Thank you. Excuse me, please? - Yes, absolutely. - Thank you. - Thank you so much for doing this. I mean it. Everybody's having such a great time. And after this, you will never have to host another company party again. - You promise? - You have my word. (easy listening jazz music) - what can I get you? - Oh, nah, I was just checking out the inventory. Chile, France, california. They're all places I still need to visit. - Oh yeah, I know what you mean. One day I will visit Italy, but until then, enjoy it in a glass. Care to join me? I have this really nice blend, or... - I'm not much of a drinker. Plus it's a work thing, so. - Yeah, of course. - Sorry, I'm franco. - Angela. Hi. - Oh, you're greg's wife. - I am, yeah. - [franco] beautiful home. Great party. Thanks for having me. - Thank you. Can I get you something? I have club soda, I think I have water? - Honestly don't bother. I'm just here to take a few photos. I'll be out soon. - I didn't even know they had a photographer. - Oh no, this is just a hobby I picked up recently. In real life I'm the accountant, but I guess this is what I get for talking about my hobbies too much at work. Do you mind if I... - Oh. - You don't have to if you don't want to. - [angela] no, no, no, that's fine, yeah. - Okay. - Maybe I can use it for my business. - What's your business? - Well my business is wine actually. - Oh. - [angela] yeah. - Here, stay right there. I'm gonna get the wine in the background. - Like this? - Yeah, bring it a little closer to you. (chuckling) beautiful. - [angela] that is quite the camera. - Yeah, it's an old film camera my dad gave to me when I was a kid. - Wow. - Old fashioned. - Yeah it is. Where do you even get that developed these days? - I set up a dark room in my house. - That is quite the hobby. - I'm terrible at it, but I'm learning. I'm getting better. - Well maybe after this merger you can turn that into a full time job. - Strange as it sounds, I love my job. - That is strange. - I'm a forensic accountant. Which means I look through the books, look for mistakes and hidden costs. That's why greg hired me. Every merger needs a geek, so. - Go on, I'm sure you're not a geek. - I promise you I am. - You know, my business actually has been growing lately. - Oh that's great. - I love selling wine, but keeping up with the invoices and the taxes, but I was just wondering maybe you might know of a bookkeeper? - Yeah, sure. Let me see if she's available first and I'll let you know. - I would really appreciate that, yeah. - It's easy. Us geeks, we all know each other. - [greg] my fearless warriors! (glass clinking) - excuse me. - This is our last gathering to celebrate everything that we have accomplished together. For five long years we've built this company from the ground up. I just wanna toast everybody for their incredible hard work. Oh, and also a very special thank you of course to my beautiful wife angela for sticking by me after the countless trips out of town and late nights at the office. So thank you, babe. And this time next week, if everything goes well... Oh, where's franco? Franco, there you are. Franco, our newest employee, has gone over the books with a fine-toothed comb and just today gave us the green light. So we are one step closer to the merger and a brighter future. So everyone, here is to us. I won't miss you. (laughing) but I will miss you. Cheers! - [partygoers] cheers! - I'm so proud of you. (dramatic piano music) hold on one sec, okay? Franco. Franco, I know you don't really drink, but everyone's supposed to take one home as a little thank you from greg and myself. - Thank you, that's... Very kind. - Oh please, I have a ton of boxes in my office. And it's really good wine. You can regift it if you want. I promise I won't be offended. (laughing) - it's nice meeting you, angela. - You too. (dramatic atmosphere music) - oh my god! Janie, what are you doing? - What are you doing coming through the back? - I always come through the back. - Not at night you don't. - Since when do you have a gun? - Jack got it for me when he traveled for work. Now that he's gone, I keep it handy. You never know. Sorry I scared you, mama. - Does vivian know that you have that? - Of course not, and it's never anywhere where she can find it. Come on. We're hanging out back. She's over there. - Hey honey. You having fun? - Yup. How's the party? - It's boring without you. I missed you, so I came over. Is gracie being good? - No, she ate my sandwich. - She ate your sandwich? Gracie always stealing food when she comes to auntie janie's huh? - She doesn't do that at home? - Eh, she does when greg's there. - When's the party over? - It's gonna be late, baby. But we're gonna come get you when we're done okay? - [janie] she can spend the night again. I don't mind at all. - Yeah, we'll see. Thank you. Okay honey. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. - There you are! I was looking around like an idiot. I don't know greg's work friends. Hi. - Hi, you look pretty. - You look great. - I'll introduce you to everyone. They are a ton of fun, let me tell you. - You're lying. - Yes I am. (laughing) - just introduce me to the cute single ones please 'cause is that the only reason why I'm here. Of course. Well besides you. - Oh thanks, yeah, thanks a lot. Well the cute single one just left, so. - Of course he did. - You have bad timing. I'm gonna get you some wine though. - [claire] every time. Can't be a cute single one left. Story of my life. - That is my top isn't it? - It is. Thank you. - You're welcome. (laughing) okay, wine is over there, there is food over there. - Nice. - And my husband over there. - Smile pretty. - Always do. You try to have fun. - Yeah. (laughing) nice. - Angela, you haven't met my new assistant. - [angela] hi. - Nice to meet you, angela. I've heard so much about you. - Oh. Strangely I haven't heard anything about you. - No no no, remember rose had the thing with her family. Lisa's her replacement. - Oh, right. It's so nice to meet you. Gosh, those are beautiful earrings. Wow. - Thanks. Don't we have some numbers to go over? - Oh. Yeah. In my office, babe. We will be right back. (dramatic atmosphere music) - she's cute. - Yeah. She is. Who you texting? - Just a work e-mail. - Is that your new secretary? - Lisa, yeah. She's really great. She's very organized, so it's been a big help. - She seemed nice. - She is nice. - And beautiful. - She's okay. - Come on, she's a bombshell. - Are you jealous? - No! No. Maybe. A little. - Honey, I love you. You have nothing to worry about. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. I think it's kinda sexy actually. - What? No. - Yes. - No! - And, and, I saw you flirting with franco tonight at the party. - Okay, not. - You were, and it's okay because I know you love me. Right? (chuckling) - of course. - And I love you. Babe, babe, I have a really long day tomorrow. - Yeah, no, I get it. - I'm just exhausted. - No, I know. After the merger. - Come on. - No. - I love you. - I love you too. (dramatic atmosphere music) - [greg] come on vivian, you're making me late! - [vivian] dad, come on, you're making me late! - All right, I'll see you later. - No, the invoices are late because I'm having a hard time keeping up with the wine orders. I'm just a little behind on accounting. Okay, please just give me a week and I will have everything in order, okay? (doorbell ringing) and I promise you I am hiring a bookkeeper soon. Okay. Thank you. Oh, hi. - I apologize for showing up like this, but I didn't have your e-mail. - Oh, that's okay. Did you wanna come in? - No, I have to head back to the office. I just wanted to let you know that I contacted my bookkeeper friend. - Oh that's wonderful. Thank you. - Unfortunately she's on maternity leave and not available. She's not taking any new clients. - Oh. - But as an apology, if you'd like, I'm happy to take a look at the books for you. Try to help until we find someone else. - That's really sweet of you, but... - don't worry about my time. I have plenty of it now that the merger's almost complete. I won't charge you. I feel badly that I wasn't able to find someone for you. - You really don't have to do that. - As you wish, but my offer still stands. Let me know. - Are you free maybe tomorrow? - I am. - [angela] do you know the cafe by the library over there? - The one with the big windows? - Yeah yeah yeah. That's the one. Do you wanna maybe meet tomorrow? When are you free? - Why don't you give me your info just in case we have to reschedule, but late afternoon? - 4? - Perfect. I'll see you then. - Here you go. - Okay. - Thanks. - Oh, I almost forgot. I printed this last night. I wanna try again to make it a bit more clear. You see how the blacks are a bit gray here? - No, it's, this is really great. I really love it. Thank you. - My pleasure. I'll see you tomorrow then. (dramatic atmosphere music) - hey honey, can you go get vivian for breakfast? - Anything for you, my love. (phone buzzing) (ominous atmosphere music) - are you sure? - I don't know what else to think. - [claire] bastard. - I don't know what to do. - You gotta divorce him. - What about vivian? And what if it isn't what it looks like? - What else can it be? You knew there was something weird with her at the party. I saw it too. You comment on her earrings, little tart drops one just to make sure you know. - But why would she want me to know? - 'cause that's what homewreckers do, honey. They let the wife know. And now you know. You know, my ex used to say deep down inside people wanna get caught. And he was a private detective, so. - He promised he wouldn't do this again. - I'm sorry? Again? Angela! - It was when I was pregnant with vivian. I wanted to forgive him, and I did, and then with the secretary I got this bad feeling and then the text messages... - yeah, it's pretty obvious what's going on. I'm so sorry, ang. - Our 10 year anniversary is next week and he does this. - They say that 10 years is the breaking point. - They do? - All right, maybe it's the seven year itch or something. You two might just be a little slow. - Or fast. We got the itch years ago. It almost destroyed me. - I mean that's why I left my ex. Once I found out he cheated, I said capital d-vorce and that was it. - I didn't wanna get divorced then and I don't wanna get divorced now. - You don't wanna leave him? You get even. You have your own affair. That's what I would do. - I am not having an affair. And that is not what you did, by the way. - But I would have. I wish I did, shoot. (laughing) I mean just to level the playing field. Show him how much it hurts. - Look, I have all these files and tax forms I need to take care of. I'm gonna deal with this now. I'll deal with greg tonight. - All right. I'm here for you. You can stay with me, whatever you need. - [angela] thank you. - You got this. (phone ringing) - hi. - Hey babe. I'm really sorry, I'm gonna be late tonight. It's gonna be like this the next two weeks until the merger. - I thought you said you were gonna pick up vivian. - I know I said I would do it, but there's just no way I'm getting out of here. - I just got ready for it. - I wanna meet with the vc guys. They're coming in today and I'd rather meet with them sooner rather than later. - I found it. - [greg] thank you lisa, you're the best. - You are. - [angela] greg. - Can we please ask claire to pick up vivian? Angie, are you there? Angie? - Hey janie! - Hey mama. - Hey, it's just for tonight okay? And maybe tomorrow. Greg's working late hours and I just have so much to take care of with the wine business. - It's no problem at all. You know I love having vivian over. - Oh, and you're authorized at the school, so you can pick her up. - Happy to. You know we love that ice cream shop down the street. - Oh, janie, just one other thing, I... - already took care of it. Let me show you. I know I made you uncomfortable and I would never want that. - Thanks. - Well let me just... - 2-4-3-4, that's your address. - Is it too obvious? - If someone tried to break in I think that's the first thing they'd try. Maybe our address would be better. - [janie] that's a good idea. I'll change it. - [angela] thank you, janie. (tense atmosphere music) (easy listening music) - I'm so sorry I'm late. - Don't even apologize. - I have this rule to always be early and today just was not my day. - You know when the last I just got to read a book in a cafe was? It was like I was on vacation. - Well that sounds lovely. - [franco] let me help you with that. - Oh, thank you. - Can I get you anything? - I should be asking you that. - I just had a delicious chai tea latte. You want one? - Maybe something calming? - Chamomile tea, they have that. - Yeah, that'd be great. - All right, yeah. No no, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It's okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey reese. Can I get a chamomile tea please? - Yeah, no problem. - Thanks. (phone buzzing) keep the change. Here you go. - Oh. Thank you so much. - Of course. So your clients are... - angry. - Because? - I'm just so behind on my tax paperwork. - Oh that's easy. - Is it? 'cause my books are a mess. - All right, let me take a look. Ah, your books are a mess. - Yeah, I know. God, it's embarrassing. - I've seen much worse. Like your husband's company, that was a challenge. - Really? - Yeah, but it's all in order now. My job's mostly done. The rest is up to greg and lisa. - Lisa? - Yeah, greg's assistant? One of the ones burning the midnight oil now, not me. But luckily they work well together. They're a great team. Angela? (dramatic atmosphere music) - [angela] greg and lisa. - Oh. - I think that... I know, 'cause he cheated years ago and... - I don't wanna talk out of turn, but people in the office were wondering if something was going on. No proof of course, but if it's true I'm so sorry. If I told you I know how you felt would that help? - What would help is if I knew how to stop hurting. - That's the toughest part. But I promise you you will find love again. No matter how badly someone's hurt you there is love out in the world for you, angela. - How do you know? - Because I was hurt. She cheated and I lost my mind, but now I know that love is possible again. I can see it. Okay, your numbers are actually a lot more reasonable than you think. So I'm just gonna transfer this over to a tax program and, oh. You probably don't have a tax program right? - No no no, I do actually, yeah. It's right here. - Great. Let me just transfer this over. Ah. - [angela] what? - You need updated software, but I can help you with that. (loud accordion music) - you know, we can find another place to work. - Actually. Follow me. - Angela? Hey, I know you're angry. I came home early so we could talk. I have something I need to tell you. (ominous atmosphere music) angela? (country rock music) (ominous atmosphere music) (country ballad music) ♪ if you're gonna leave ♪ do it gently with a stone face ♪ - angela, I don't know where you guys are and it's almost vivian's bedtime. Look, I know you've been upset that I've been working late. Clearly you found the earrings. So we need to talk. (dramatic atmosphere music) (phone ringing) - did you get my e-mail? - Yeah, I will answer it later. Did you by any chance lose one of those earrings? - I did. - Why didn't you tell me? - Because they were so expensive, I'm sorry. But I already ordered a replacement so please don't be mad. It'll be here tomorrow. We have to be more careful. I hate all this lying. - Yeah, me too. ♪ We'll write a couple songs ♪ write a couple more (dramatic atmosphere music) (phone buzzing) - how long have you lived here? - Just a few months. - I like your taste. - It's a rental. I like to rent furnished places. Tend to go where the work takes me. Ow. Damn. - You okay? - Mmmhm. All good. (tense atmosphere music) - oh. I was just admiring your photos. Did you take these? - No. Someone else did. - She kinda looks like me. - A little I guess. - In my younger years. Who is she? - She was... You know what, I think I actually will join you. - You know what, I think I should go actually. - No. No no no, please don't, I'm sorry. Just have a glass of wine with me. In memory of my niece. May she rest in peace. - I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have asked. - She was murdered 15 years ago. It still haunts me. I feel like I could've stopped it, but I didn't. It just breaks my heart. - I can't imagine what you and your family went through. - You have a good heart, angela. I haven't met anyone like you in a really long time. Thank you. - Hey. It's okay. (phone ringing) - [claire] hello? - Hey claire, it's greg. - Yeah, I know, greg. - Is angela with you? - [claire] she's not home? - She's not. - Well if she was here I wouldn't tell you. Okay greg? And if she's not home, you probably deserve it. (dramatic atmosphere music) - you okay? I wanna ask you something. But I don't want it to influence what's going on in your life. - Let's not ask each other anything okay? I just wanna enjoy this moment. - Fair enough. I'm sorry, I just have to know. Are you going back to your husband? - I'll never go back to him. - That's smart, angela. Once a cheater always a cheater. - Do you think I'm a cheater? - Of course not. What happened tonight doesn't count. You have my heart. If you want it. - Gonna need to take things slow okay? You have me right now. - Not forever? - You're pushing it. (laughing) - and then after school I have soccer practice, so if you're gonna pick me up be there at 4. - And then ice cream. - Yes. (laughing) - come on, mama. - Vivian. - [vivian] hi dad. - Did you spend the night here? Is mom with you? - [janie] she's not here, greg. She asked me to take vivian to school today. - I'll take her. - [janie] but... - I will take her. Come on. (dramatic atmosphere music) (phone ringing) - hi angela. - Hey janie, did you have a chance to pick up vivian? - [janie] yeah, she's at school. - Oh good. - It's none of my business, but is everything okay with you and greg? - No. No it's not. I'll explain everything later okay? But thank you for taking care of vivian for me. - [janie] okay hun. You take care. - You too. - [janie] bye bye. (ominous atmosphere music) - franco, why do you have those? - It's a long story, I'd rather not. - I'm sorry, I'm not trying to get in your business, but I feel like I can't ignore what I just saw. - You're right. You deserve to know. The man who murdered my niece, he was a photographer. I keep the photos to remind me of her. They're all I have left. - You can't get over the past by keeping those horrible photos in your life. - I guess they give me closure. I don't feel I should have to explain myself. - I think you should take me back to my car. - No, please don't... - [angela] I need to go. - Yes. Of course. I understand. Will you call me? - Yeah. I just... I don't know when. I'm dealing with a lot right now. - Right. If you need anything angela, I'm here for you. - Thank you. I really do have to go though. - Can I just get one last kiss? I'll get rid of the photos of my niece if it'll make you feel better. - I don't want you to do anything that you wouldn't do for yourself. - No, but I'm happy to. (dramatic atmosphere music) (door opening and closing) - do you know how worried I've been? - Well I didn't think you cared. Get your hands off me, greg. - What is going on, angela? I haven't seen you like this since... - what? Since I was pregnant? - Yeah. Actually, yes. - Yeah, well it should look familiar 'cause it turns out you haven't changed a bit. - What are you talking about? - The text messages with lisa? "your wife is gonna find out?" well guess what, I found out. - Then why are you so upset? A trip to Italy, diamond earrings. You know, most women would be thrilled... - what are you talking about? - For our anniversary. I didn't have time to pick them up, so I asked lisa to do it before the party and then I guess, I don't know, she thought it would be funny to wear them. But then you noticed them. All I was trying to do was surprise you. Lisa even booked our tickets to Italy. - Italy? - Babe, I was gonna tell you tomorrow night for our anniversary. - You remembered. - Of course I remembered. Why wouldn't I remember? We leave right after the merger. I even had to get your passport without you knowing so that lisa could book the tickets. I haven't had a lot of time, but I really wanted to do something special for us. I know how hard this has been for you, for us. But I promise you nothing is going on that you don't know about. Besides the diamond earrings and a trip to Italy. Look. Two weeks in tuscany. After the merger, we're gonna have the time and the money to really enjoy ourselves together. And that is just the beginning. - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm just surprised, that's all. - Yeah. Hey, I have to go to work. - Of course. Of course, sweetie. I'll see you tonight. - [greg] I love you. - I love you too. (dramatic atmosphere music) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (knocking) - what are you doing here? - I'm sorry, I just came by to give you this. It's the updated software so you can finish the tax paperwork. - [angela] you can't come over unannounced like this. - So if I announce it first it's okay. I'm just joking. - I know that I said my marriage was over, but... - angela. He cheated. - No no, it turns out I was wrong. - So you were wrong both times? Everyone in the office, they were wrong too? - I have to pick up my daughter from school. I can't talk about this right now. - I have to know. Are you staying with him? - I am. And I thank you for your kindness and for last night, but please. Don't text me or call me anymore okay? - Okay. (tense atmosphere music) - hi honey. - [vivian] hi mom. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Where were you? - I needed to to help claire with something, okay? - Overnight? That's weird. - How was school? - Same as yesterday. - I didn't see you yesterday. - [vivian] same as the day before it. You know. (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (dramatic atmosphere music) - franco, I specifically told you that you can't come here. Hey! Oh my god, I'm so sorry. (dramatic gust) - don't. No. - I'm doing it. To my beautiful wife who stood by me at my worst and made me the man I am today. I mean it, angela. You taught me how to love, how to be a good husband and father. I was a mess when we first fell in love. You showed me what being a good partner is. I know we had a rough start, but that is long behind us. You okay? - Yeah, no, I'm just tired. - Okay. I have to ask. Were you at claire's the other night? I know. Of course you were. Where else would you be? Right? - I don't wanna talk about the past anymore. I wanna just focus on the future. To many, many more years of love. - I will drink to that. (dramatic atmosphere music) (ominous atmosphere music) - you know what? Do you mind if we move tables? The air is just blowing right on me. - Oh, okay. Let me get the waiter. - Let me ask. Let me, I can take care of it. - Hey. Hey, it's franco. - Hey. - Franco, how are you? - What a surprise. - You remember my wife angela. - Yes, the wine expert right? - Yeah. It's nice to see you again. - Who are you here with? - Oh I'm just meeting a friend. - Definitely get the lobster. It's my favorite. - [franco] thanks for the tip. - Well we're celebrating our anniversary, so it's nice to see you. - Happy anniversary. How many years? - [greg] 10. - Impressive. The one is love and the zero's eternal. - [greg] very poetic, thank you. - What do you expect from an accountant right? (laughing) - I'll see you at the office. - All right. Nice seeing you. - [greg] he's a great guy. We're really lucky to have him. Did you wanna change tables? - No no, no, I'm fine. - So we've got hotels here. And here. And here. - Wow. - And here. Babe, you were kinda distracted tonight. - I didn't like that you brought that accountant over to our table like that. I mean how well do you really know the guy? - What? Why? - [angela] I just want you to make sure you know who you're working with. - First you think I'm sleeping with my secretary and now you're telling me I don't know how to run my business? - [angela] I just want you to be careful. - [greg] about what? Franco? - [angela] yes. - I like franco. I think he's a pretty good guy. If we weren't up to our necks with this merger, I might even be friends with him. - Oh no. - What is this about? - [angela] I shouldn't have brought it up. - [greg] whatever is going on, you can talk to me about it, okay? - I love you. (ominous atmosphere music) let's make love. (phone buzzing) - finally. I was about to call search and rescue. - For all intents and purposes, I stayed at your place two nights ago. - Oh do tell. - Claire, I messed up. You know how you said to get back at greg for having an affair I should have one myself? - I still stand by that. - Yeah, well I did, but it turns out greg didn't. - Are you kidding me? What about the texts and the earring? - No. It was all for me for a surprise for our anniversary. - Oh no. - Yeah, but it gets worse. The guy I was with, he works with greg. - Angela, that's playing with fire. - It's worse, it's an inferno. I think the guy is crazy. - [claire] well of course he is. You're a catch. Can you blame him? - No, I mean unstable. He's been stalking me and texting me. - [claire] okay, block him. - I did, but wherever I go he's there. Our anniversary dinner last night. I'm afraid to leave the house. I think, no, I know he's following me. - Well either he's a psycho or... - [angela] or? - Maybe he's just a nice guy that you hurt. What if you apologize? Maybe he'll stop. I mean it's not his fault that you were wrong about your husband is it? Let's not forget that he cheated first. - Yeah, 10 years ago. - Well then call it even. - Oh my god. I can't believe I cheated on my husband. - Look, angela, you're allowed to make one mistake. - I feel like this mistake is gonna haunt me the rest of my life. (phone ringing) - hey babe, what's up? - [angela] hey, I'm not feeling well. Do you mind picking up vivian from school today? - Honey, you know I can't get away right now. - [angela] please greg? - Can we ask janie to do it? She's authorized. - [angela] I already did, she's busy. - [greg] what about claire? - She's not authorized and she's showing a house today. Greg, please. You can go back to work after. - Okay. I will take care of it, all right? - [angela] thanks. - Anything I can help with? - Gracie! Come here, girl! Come on. Good girl. Come on. (water running) (laughing) - it's a pizza bag. It's very pretty. - My dad bought it for me. - Wow, I love it. It's really pretty. Oh look. Vivian, it's your mom. Say hi. - Hi. - Get out of my house. Vivian, go to your room. Now! Close the door, baby. (door closing) get out of my house. - Wow angela, where are your manners? You haven't even offered me a glass of wine yet. - If you ever come near my child again... - if your husband asks me again I'm afraid we're gonna have a problem. He's authorized me at vivian's school. And given me an extra set of house keys. He's my boss, I can't say no. - Give me those key, or I swear. - You'll call the cops? I wouldn't do that if I were you. See, the funny thing about numbers is if they don't add up correctly, they could seriously hurt the merger. - What did you just say? - You heard me. - I'm so sorry, my daughter was playing with the phone. You're threatening my husband's business. - That was a very smart move. - Do you know how hard he's worked all of these years? - I can't tell what I love more about you. Your beauty or your intelligence. - Oh come on, franco, be reasonable. - All I'm saying is I could easily ruin your life. - We had one night. - Like you ruined mine. - It was a mistake. - It was not! A mistake. - What do you want? What, an apology? - Yes. Admit what you've done. - Fine, and then you'll leave me alone? - [franco] yes. - And my family. - [franco] I would never hurt vivian. - What do you want me to say? - That you're a cheater. - I'm a cheater. - And that you fell in love with me. - No, I did not fall in love with you. - Yes. - No, I love my husband. - Well you didn't that night! Say. It. Very well. You know greg, you work so hard. So hard all the time. I'd hate for it to all be for nothing. What's your move, angela? - [vivian] mom! - Stay in your room honey, I'll be right there! - And you fell in love with me. - I... Fell in love with you. (tense atmosphere music) (dog barking) - gracie! Cut it out! What is it? - Why would you let franco pick up vivian? And give him a key to our home? - You left me no choice. I couldn't really ask lisa to do it, could I? - You were supposed to do it. - I said I would handle it and I did. (dog barking) damn it! - [angela] I told you I don't like him. - I thought that was the champagne talking. - It was me talking and you not listening. - This is the most stressful time in my career and I really need my wife to hold it together. - I need to be heard. - We are falling apart. We can't keep doing this. Just tell me what to do to make you happy and I will do it, but please stop trying to make me feel like everything I'm doing is wrong. - That's not my intention. I just need this merger to be over so we can get back to our lives. - I want the same thing. But we have to work together okay? (glass shattering) stay here. (ominous atmosphere music) (dog whining) angela! Angela, call for help! Angela! You're okay, girl. You're okay, I'm here. Get my keys! Call the vet! (dramatic atmosphere music) - hey. How's she doing? - It's not good. The vet said that she might not make it. Did vivian hear anything? - Yeah, she did. I finally got her back to sleep. - What did you tell her? - Just that gracie got sick and went to the vet. - And the window? - It cracked, I didn't know what to say. - Okay, okay. Sometimes it's better to lie right? - This was a pretty aggressive act. - We're trying to pull some security footage right now, but there was a problem with the system. I'm having one of my tech guys take a look at it. - Either of you have any enemies? - [greg] maybe I underpaid an employee once, but I can't think of anybody who would go to this extreme. - [detective] ma'am? - No. - Well this wasn't random. It's a message for one or both of you. I suggest you figure out who and get back to me. (text dinging) (tense atmosphere music) - vivian's gonna be up soon. Babe. Babe. Okay? I guess I'll drive vivian to school. If you're gonna have a drink I better drive her. - I just got an e-mail. Vantigem is pulling out of the merger. They wanna take another look at the numbers. There's nothing new to look at. Franco turned it upside down and inside out. The numbers are solid. - It's just gonna take a little more time okay? I mean if you trust franco's work. - I've been lying to you, angela. I am so so sorry. - What do you mean? - We're broke. We're gonna lose our home. If the merger doesn't go through we love everything. - But I thought with your salary and my wine sales... - I stopped taking a salary four months ago. We've been living on our savings and your wine sales. - Why would you do that? - Because a stock deal was offered and I took that instead of my salary. If the deal goes through, the stock triples. We can pay off our mortgage and have money, lots of it. But if the deal doesn't go through, then we won't make it through the end of the month. I should have hired somebody to double check franco's numbers and I should have told you. - Hey, look at me. As long as we have each other and vivian that's all that matters. We've gone through so much already. We can get through this. I know it. (dramatic atmosphere music) hi. Is detective davis in? I know who tried to kill our dog. But... - [davis] let me guess. Your husband doesn't. - We were having problems and I thought our marriage was over and it just happened one time. - [davis] no judgment. So the person you were with probably did this. - When I told him that I wasn't leaving my husband he got obsessive. - [davis] how so? - Coming to my house and following me, threatening me. - [davis] and you didn't report this? - I thought you said no judgment. (dramatic atmosphere music) I mean he threw my dog through a window. - Okay, hold up. You're telling me franco tried to kill your dog? - Yeah. He's insane. - Listen, I know you're incredible, but I didn't know you were that incredible. - Don't joke. This is serious. - I've just never heard of a man taking rejection that hard. - I know, but there's clearly something wrong with him. I think I need to tell greg. - Yeah. I mean you're ruined either way. - I know. - Okay. You tell greg. He's devastated, your marriage is probably over. Or you don't tell greg and he can't protect you. Curtain a is the only option. - I probably deserve what's coming to me. - No. Look angela, you made a mistake. It's called being human. At least you didn't stay with franco for a month like max did. That's making a mistake and turning it into a lifestyle choice. Okay, here's the plan. You tell greg tonight and you two go to the cops together with franco's work address. - Get the accountant arrested that verified the books? That would completely kill the merger. I can't. - Angela, you might be dead if you don't do something. Tonight. - I'll tell greg tonight. After vivian goes to sleep, greg can go to the office and get franco's address and bring it to the police. If greg doesn't leave me first. I gotta go handle this. - All right, you do what you gotta do, you know? You got this. - I love you. - I love you too. Let me know how it goes. Okay? Be safe. - I'll try. (dramatic atmosphere music) (music intensifying) how many devices is it on? Damn it. - [vivian] mom, can I watch a movie? - Yes honey! - Mom! - I'm sorry honey, can you find a book to read instead? - Why? - Because I need this right now, okay? - [vivian] fancy. - Yeah. No phones or tablets tonight at the dinner table okay? I want us to be a family. I want this to be perfect. Daddy's coming home early today. I made his favorite. - Spaghetti and meatballs? - That is your favorite. Oh look, daddy's home. Hey love. - [franco] hello, angela. - Why is he here? You know I don't like him. - I thought we were done with all of that. Franco overheard someone at the party saying some pretty awful things about me. - I didn't think much of it at first, but then when greg told me about the window... - Franco thinks he might be able to identify them. He's gonna take a look at some of the security footage. Where's the tablet? - It's in your office. - Come here. - Not in front of my daughter. - How's the new software working out for you? - It took a while to get the footage. It's not very good. - What's this? - Oh, vivian must've been playing with it. So here. You can see the figure coming around the side of the house. - Sorry, it's a little too dark and blurry. It's almost like a bad photograph. (smoke alarm blaring) - vivian, get back! Go in the living room! - Kiss me. - [angela recording] I'm a cheater. I fell in love with you. - I don't wanna share you, angela. It's not really my style. But I'm a nice guy. I won't kill the merger or play that for greg if I can just have you all to myself. - Stop it. Stop it. - [greg] angela, can I get a hand in here? - Stop fighting me. You'll never win. - [angela] oh my god. I'm so sorry, babe. - Aw man, that's too bad. Why don't I order us some food. Who likes chinese? - [vivian] I do. - [franco] so sorry I couldn't figure out who it was. - Oh gosh no, how could you? - A little grainy. - What's that? - A little grainy. - Yeah, yeah. And there was that weird click that clipped it. I don't know. It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. It's in the past. - Yeah. Well you've got good news coming up hopefully after the merger. - [greg] yeah. - It'll be all done. - [greg] we're gonna see. This one's excited aren't you? - [vivian] mmmhm. - [greg] yeah. - Thanks again. - Hey, thanks so much for being here. Let's do this again. - Please. - All right. Drive safe! - Bye franco! - [France] bye cupcake. - All right, let's get you to bed. You're making me late. - [vivian] you're making me late. (phone buzzing) - how'd it go? - [angela] terrible. Franco was here. - What? - Yeah. He has my house bugged. And he knows greg's passwords. I'm calling you from my backyard because I'm afraid to say anything inside the house. He said that if I tell greg the truth he's gonna make sure the merger collapses. - Okay, that's just truly evil. And illegal, by the way. - Yeah, I know. Wait. Claire, your ex-husband. - What about him? - Isn't he still a private detective? He could find something out about him. Something to make him stop. Some dirt, something. - Angela, you're asking me to reach out to the guy that broke my heart? - Claire, I am desperate here. Please. I need to fight fire with fire and I need you to do this tonight. - [claire] fine. His favorite bar is vick's. I'll just pounce on him when he shows up. - [angela] okay. - [claire] if this guy has anything to hide, my ex will find it. Then there's always curtain a, angela. Which I suggest you do anyway. You don't know what this guy's capable of. - Thank you. So any news on the merger? - It's anyone's guess at this point. But franco thinks it's still a go. He's a decent guy. I know you don't think so, but he is. (classy jazz music) (shower running) (tense atmosphere music) (classy jazz music) - oh I didn't order this. - It's from the gentleman. (tense atmosphere music) - thanks babe. - I owe you an apology. - For what? - For thinking you were cheating again after all these years. - Honey, you forgave me 10 years ago and you had a passing moment of jealousy. I am totally okay with that. - I was angry. I carried it with me after all these years. - You've been kind and gracious and loving and I have never felt anything but that from you. - Would you forgive me if I made the same mistake? (chuckling) - [franco] so let me get this straight. You're waiting for your ex-husband. - Sexy right? - Are you guys getting back together? - No no. That ship has sailed. - How far? - Far away. Like off the edge of the planet hopefully. (chuckling) he cheated. - Ah. I know what that's like. - It's the worst. - I don't think I could go through that again. - [claire] recent? - Yeah. - Let me get the next round. - Oh no no. - [claire] I got it. It's fine. - I insist. It's nice to talk to someone who understands. What did you say your name was? - [claire] I didn't. But it's claire. - Eric. - [claire] nice to meet you, eric. - Nice to meet you, claire. - I thought you were cheating again. - So that was your response? To go and cheat on me with franco? This makes so much more sense. Why you've been acting insane. - He is insane. He is. - He he hold a gun to your head when you slept with him? - No. - No! You did this! You did this to us! Now. At the most important moment of my life. You are killing me, angela. - I know how you feel. I felt it too! And if I could take it back I would! (dramatic atmosphere music) - hi, is detective davis in? Can you tell him that angela harris called? He has my number. No, no, I'd rather speak to him directly please. Okay, thank you. (ominous atmosphere music) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (music intensifying) (phone buzzing) (suspenseful atmosphere music) (dramatic sting) (phone buzzing) (violent struggling) - ma'am, please stay in your car. (knocking) - hey, what are you doing? I told you she's in there. - Ma'am, we can't just break down the door. What did your friend tell you to make you believe she's in trouble? - She texted me. - [cop] okay. Can se wee the text please? - What, you're not gonna do anything? - Maybe she took your advice and left. Or maybe she's still in there having a nice night. Either way there's nothing more we can do. - No, please, I... - [cop] have a nice night, ma'am. (edm music) (phone buzzing) - I know you're in that dark room, you freak show! They know I'm here! They know where I am! (dramatic atmosphere music) 2-4-3-4. (alarm beeping) what? 2-4-3-6. (ominous atmosphere music) - mom? - Hi honey, what are you doing up? - I had to pee and I heard something. Why do you have a gun? - No no no, it's not a gun, honey. I need you to go back to bed though okay? - But I wanna come home. - I know, baby, I know. But I need you to stay here, okay? Look, it's almost morning. Just go get another hour of sleep for me. Yeah? All right, I'm gonna see you tomorrow after school. Okay? All right, go. Go back to sleep.
