I'm pretty sure the Ripper is here. Now, like, inside my freaking house! No shit, hun, like this is for real. Yes, this is for real. Okay, settle down, sis. You want us to call the cops? Come on, man, she'll be long dead before the cops get there. Wow, that makes me feel a lot better. Thanks, Evanora. Sorry, sisters, there's nothing there. I must be losing my mind. That's not what the spirits are saying. I told you there was no there. Seriously. Dammit M, who are you gonna believe? Your wine-addled eyes or the spirits of our long dead sisters? Oh, I'm serious.

I mean, she's bound by blood and spirit to protect him. So, it should be okay, right? I'm beat. Let's worry about it next week. Oh, sounds like a plan. Ah, deep breaths sisters. Calling in the gods and guardians from the corners. All elements, earth, air, fire, water. Close and protect our sister in your graces. Keep her in your protective realm. We shall return to her, as above so below, as within so without. So mote it be. And so it is. Would you grab the crate? What do you think I'm doing? Just checking. This is a big job. Dad, I know. Hello? Hello? In here. Hi. Hey We talked on the phone. I'm David, this is my son Robert. Hi. Well, thank you both for coming out. You know, I know this was a last minute scheduling but as you can see, the bones of the building are in good shape. I figured I can leave you guys to it and check back some time in the morning. Uh, we'll get as far as we can today but uh, this will take a couple of days at least. Oh. I'm sorry. I was under the impression that this could be done overnight. We're on a very tight schedule and the next team has to start the second you're done. The second we're done? Have you seen this place? Well, my son, he just... There's a lot of work to do. We can't leave behind any spores, mould, anything. Or it will all just grow right back. Well, I can certainly understand that but isn't there any way we could speed up the process a little closer to my timeline? One night, really? It's good money. You know, there's no way for us to be done in time. Not if we do this right. It'll be passable. It'll be garbage. Wallace and Son, that's my name on the van, too. You should let me have a say in this kind of thing. You don't have the first clue how to run a business. And until you do, you don't get to tell me how to do things. Okay. How am I supposed to know how to run things if you never let me part of that conversation? Jesus. If you wanna be in control of things so bad, why don't you take control of picking up that dead rat you spotted in the hall? Think you can manage that?! You okay there? Yeah, it's just... It's grosser than I thought. Hey. You hungry? So, I looked up this house. And it's no wonder why they want it so bad, because last owner of the building died of some fungus disease thing. Doesn't surprise me. Old places like this, takes over in a hurry, if no one's paying attention. Or if nobody does the right job. What are you humming? I don't know. Just stuck in my head.

Time to settle down. How about you maybe give me a grandchild? And rent my body to a parasite for nine months? - No, thank you. - Mrs. Jones' son has two children already and he's only 28. Oh, well, maybe I should just give him a call. - That sounds horrible. - Uh. What is with the black? Mark of respect for the dead. Your youth, your lust, your dreams. Oh, well, makes you look fat. Hmm, fat and old, welcome to the club, sis. Don't listen to him, Lauren. Thirties are the best. It's when one's really awakened. - Got it. - Sexually. I said, got it. Happy birthday. Party time. Someone's been drinking. Not a drop actually. I'm off the sauce. No booze before baby, right, honey? Oh, he says 'cause I can't drink, neither can he. This is our pregnancy. Isn't that so boring? Yes. Unbelievably boring. It's like I've always said, radish is the most versatile vegetable in the fridge. I don't think so. Hey all. Let's get turnt up, huh. - You offering minors alcohol? - That's illegal. - But no, I just thought... - We don't really do that. Plus, beer goes against our brand. There you are. Someone's been avoiding my DMs. I wanted to talk to you about my new business. - I'm selling all new skincare. - Oh, yeah. It's amazing. I get to be my own boss. I can make my own money and they talked to me about who I wanted to get on board and I thought about you, because you're fabulous. Oh my God! I don't want part of the Pyramid Scheme. It's okay, I'll send you some books. Turning 30 is the worst. What happened to everybody? I mean, we used to be cool. Please, please tell me you guys are drinking. Oh, anything to make Omid's sympathy pregnancy bearable. Thank God. It's a bit of a sipper. It's naturally fermented, so it's a bit of a fizz to it, but no sugar and no hangover. It's a little bit more expensive, but you can really taste the difference when you shop local. - Good to know. - Yeah. But enough about groceries. What's the boss over here? Who's sleeping with who these days? Well, we were actually just talking about our new favorite porn. Ooh, scandalous. It's this little thing called, "real estate." Oh my God, yesterday I saw this incredible four-bed in Guildford. It has a Belfast sink. Oh, gorgeous. Can you imagine? The best thing to come out in Belfast. Except the Titanic anyway. Oh my God. You know, we've been looking at this little place just off Wilson Avenue. Oh! It's listed at 500k... Shots. Oh yes, girl. - Shots. - Sure, yeah. Ooh, what was that? - Ginger and turmeric. - Wow. What the fuck! What's that? Creep up much? Bee-bop. Sounds lit. Can I try? No, you're too old. Excuse me? You can't do a bee-bop in your 30s. It's not safe. You'll get stuck. Okay, first off, I'm barely 30, and my generation invented social media. You... Oh, you like that? I could teach you if you want. Get you ready for the clubs? Just let me try. - Seriously. - No, it's okay. We tried to warn her. Ooh, you're too, you old... I'm Poppy, I mean, I'm so pretty. Whatever, I'm fine.

What's going on? - This is what you wanted. - This is what you wanted. What did you do to me? - Now you can be a teen forever. - Now you can be a teen forever. I don't wanna be a teenager again! - And ever. - And ever. I take it back. - And ever. - And ever. No, no. Okay. It's... It's just a bad dream. Wake up, Lauren. Wake up! I'm okay with turning 30. I'll get my life together. I'll go to farmer's market and I'll invest in Bit coin. I'll even move to the countryside. Thirty really is the best years of your life. Oh God. There's no place like home. I'm thirty, flirty, and thriving. You watch too many movies. We warned you, Lauren. But you wouldn't listen. Now you'll live here forever. That's not fair! The 2000s were the worst! You wouldn't understand, no contour, and high-wasted jeans. Nobody looked good in low-rise! Except for Britney. Obviously, except for Britney. Everybody knows that. We told you not to do the dance. Oh, the bee-bop. The bee-bop. I can delete the bee-bop. Where's the phone, huh. Come on. The CDs... uh! Ah, leave me alone! No! No! Now this here is the master suite. Plenty of room for you folks to spread out. And for your luggage, two closets. There, and there. All stocked with fresh towels. Now, the bathroom is down the hallway on the left. But here on your right, the most beautiful view in all of Tennessee. I promise you that. You get up early enough in the morning, you can see the sun rise right through your window. So, what do you think, huh? A little piece of heaven. It's nice. Uh, there's just one bed, but I can bring up a cot for the little fellow. No, it's fine. I think it's fine, we can make do. You like it, don't you, sweetie? So, what's around here? Is there a place I can get a drink or something? I don't think you're going of find a bar out here. Was I talking to you or him? We've been stuck in a car since 5:00. Oh, don't mention it. Travel can be a blessing and a curse, I know. There isn't much around here, I'm afraid. It's part of its charm. But, I do have a little stash of Brandy. I'd be delighted to share it with you. You have other guests? College students. They've come up from Uruguay. Uh, Paraguay, um, po... Puerto Rico, something. All girls? Yes. They've come up to explore the falls nearby. They are beautiful this time of year. If you folks have a chance, I've got some brochures and some information that I can show you. Is there a room maybe further away? Oh, I don't think they'll bother you. Oh, I just worry about this little light sleeper of ours. Oh, we have quiet hours every night, starting at 9 o'clock. It's house policy. Idina, where's my pills? What? My pills. Christ Almighty. They're in there. Where? Huh? Not here, not here. Hold on. I'll find them. I swear if you didn't pack my pills... Say, you like ice cream? - Just please... - I bet you do. What's your favorite flavor? I'm doing the best I can. - Strawberry? - This isn't working. Chocolate? Rocky Road? Oh, here. Here. I put them in this pocket. I'd forgotten. Goddammit. You're slipping! Hey, I always have ice cream. Little boys need a good supper. Sorry. He's so tired, aren't you, sweetie? Thank you for the room. I think we'd like to settle in now. Of course. Just let me know if you... If you need anything. Any... anything at all. Shit! Girls, be careful now. The trails are dangerous up near the falls.

Amazing place. Nearly three centuries old. I'm a researcher, well, a collector, more accurately. I didn't know the Bodleian sold it's used books. So when I say collector, I'm more a collector of moments. A journalist? Are you're telling moments of history, you're a curator? The King Cobell over try is a good example. At a certain moment in time, it split, creating a unique leaf dividing equally between deciduous and coniferous structures. One moment where energy built up beneath the sub-atomic layer to a point where it has its own willpower, a determination to forge a new existence. A precursor to magic. That's what I collect. And write about it? Probably say it's time to head back. Now then, let's not spoil such a nice moment. This book was written before words existed. The text hides pinpricks and power to capture a moment, any original moment. And I... I'm sorry. Find these in the rarity, I'm afraid. Conserving every aspect of the moment. I won't take any more of your time. Original, unparalleled. This moment is mine. My book. I'll return it. Alexis off.
