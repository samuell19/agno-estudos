Woah! Woah my dears! Stop! Hooray! Home again. Oh, my feet are frozen! Alright, alright... There you are, my dears. That's it for another bloomin' year! There you are. That's better. Blocks... of blooming... ice! Bliss. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Don't know what he's bloomin' well moaning about. Life of Riley! Bed of bloomin' roses! Wonder what he does with the other 364 days. Well I'll let you into a big bloomin' secret. For a start there's the reindeer to see to every day. Then there's the garden, and my bloomin' veggie patch. Housework, shopping... In fact last year I was so bloomin' fed up with it all I decided to do something about it. A bloomin' good holiday, that's what I need. But where? Italy! Greece? Or Ireland, maybe? Holland! Canada, definately. Germany... Tunisia, Switzerland... - France! France, that's it! - Oy! Land of culture and civilisation. Food, wine, sun, camping! Perhaps not. A bloomin' genius, that's what I am. Hmm... A bit of four-by-two, tens panels of, yes... do it yourself... shouldn't take more than... Bloomin' shoddy bloomin' bent bloomin' nails! Bonjour. Aujourd'hui mes ami- Vous vous etes... Ils, er, sont... Nous, er, avons... Un, deux, trois. Lecent dix, repetes apres moi... Ou sont les plumes de ma tante? You know what you can do with your bloomin' tante, love. Bloomin' fini. Ah, thank goodness. Ah, tres bon, n'est-ce pas? Oy, mind the bloomin' paint! Right then! ...vest, shirts, trousers, hat... (mumbles) ...guide books, phrase book. Bloomin' animals. La belle bloomin' France. Marvellous. Suppose I ought to do some shopping though. Wish I didn't look so like a bloomin' foreigner. That's better! More French! Not so bloomin' conspicuous. - Monsieur? - Merci, me old mate! Right. I'm gonna have a bash at everything going. No chips, mate? Chips? Le frites? Sacre bleu! Tu plaisantes, non Monsieur! I think that means no bloomin' chips. How about Ketchup then? [Scolded in French] HP Sauce? Non, Monsieur! Just have to make the best of it then, I suppose. Monsieur. Café, crème, et... l'addition. Crumbs! Bloomin' expensive! Ooh no, no! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Where are the Alka-wotsits? The Dio-thingy?! Oh dear! Out of my bloomin' way, cows! Better get to a proper camping ground. Proper toilets for a start! Crumbs. Must be the bloomin' water. Perhaps a bit of breakfast. Whose are they? That old bloke who looks like Father Christmas. Crumbs. Time to move on. Now... where... Let me see now... pure water... Scotland! Of course! The best water in the world! Crumbs, what a place. Morning! Bloomin' cold... Bloomin' marvellous! Just the job! - Hey Mum, it's Santa Claus! - Ach, away with ye. Time to move on again, I suppose. Crumbs! It's not raining! Aah! Freezing! Crumbs! Help! Sharks! Shark! Rain. Cold. Sharks. What a bloomin' country. Enough's enough. Somewhere hot. Of course! Las Vegas! Bloomin' obvious, really. Not a bad little hotel. Have a nice day, Sir. Nice little room. A swim! That's it for today. Time for a little snack, I think. Bloomin' marvellous! Quite good little puds, too. Better smarten myself up for the evening. Where are we? There we go. Not bad! Out of a bloomin' cracker. Oh. Hang on a minute! Right! There we go. - No more bets. - Too bloomin' right mate. Nothing left to bloomin' well play with. Oh dear! Too bloomin' old for all this. Bedtime, I think. Here we go again. Ta. Fore! Hey-hey! How about that then? Look at that! ♪ Way! Hey Mom, is that fat guy Santa Claus? Time to be off again. Oh well. Crumbs, running low on money anyway. Hey mac, are you Santa Claus? Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I'd certainly better bloomin' well go home. Alright! Yep! Hooray! Home again! Oh, look at the bloomin' garden! Bloomin' weeds! The mower will never go through that bloomin' grass! Thank Heaven that's over! Good to be home, really. Better get those two rascals. Alright, alright, mind my bloomin' beard! Here we are then. What's going on here? Aha! Bloomin' post started coming in already. I can hardly get in the bloomin' door! It gets earlier every year. Better get down to it. Look at this! What will they call me next? Santa Claus, Père Noël, Saint Nicholas? Just bloomin' old Father Christmas, really. Still, all the same I suppose. Eh? Where'd you want these mate? So that's 200 Teddy Bears. No, 201. ...a Panda? Bloomin' building bricks weigh a ton! I'll have to look that one up. ...bloomin' pony? How does she think I'll get that on the sledge?! I'll think of something. Can I back the lorry round the side, mate? Where'd all this lot come from? Oh dear. Just one more bloomin' chore. Off to a fancy dress party then, Sir? I should be so bloomin' lucky! Get off. Get off! Bloomin' Christmas Eve again. Bloomin' snowed during the night. There you are my dears. And further falls of snow are expected later on this- Bloomin' sleet, bloomin' snow... It would be, wouldn't it? Roll on summer, that's what I say. Back, back... Go on, go on... Righto my dears, this is bloomin' well it! Tally ho!
