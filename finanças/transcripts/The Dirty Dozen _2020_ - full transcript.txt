For the life of a professional off-road rider even when their bodies and minds feel like quitting, their hearts won't let 'em. They'll push through the pain, overcome their doubts and give it everything they have. It's who they are, and what they want more than anything. Ask anyone who's thrown a leg over a bike, moto gets into your blood. That absolute sense of freedom is why we all fell in love with riding our dirt bikes. To even consider doing some of the things Billy Bolt does on the motorcycle, you either have to be a world-class hard enduro rider, or a little bit mad. In Billy's case, maybe it's a little bit of both. You know, since I was a kid, I've wanted to sort of push what's possible. And just so I look at things in a different way, and if I feel like it's sort of something that I don't think, you know, there's many other people or anyone else that's gonna think to try or, or have a look at, it's sort of pretty satisfying. That's the position I like to put myself in. You just do it. The trails background. The technical stuff is... is what I've, sort of, spent my life doing and perfecting. You know, it's really understanding, uh, how to go fast and the correct techniques you need to do, and... And, obviously, who doesn't love a wide open, third gear hill climb? Just, you know, leaning forward and, and keeping it flat out. Na, na... I love all enduro, I love the challenge. The variety and the change in the race is, you know, one race we have could be two hours, riding over rocks in a pretty closed area, or we could have, you know, four days of eight hours of riding. Southern California, USA, the birthplace of the freeride lifestyle. No limit, no rules. You build it, you jump it. When it comes to freeride, multi X Games gold medalist Colby Raha brings a new generation of innovation to the sport. Yeah, when you build a new jump, you're just looking at it while you're building it and you're thinking it'll work, but when it comes time to hit something new, it's like, no one's hit it, you don't even know if it's gonna line up right. If you come in crooked or something, you get pitched down the hill, like, you can wad pretty hard. Free riding's just cool. You can do whatever you want. You can go up any mountain. Do whatever... It's just like be creative as you want. It's not like a track. You just do the same thing over and over. It's like, you like that hill, build a jump. Or do, like, you want to jump down that or do whatever. I think it's sweet. If you're tired of hitting jumps all day, you can just go take off on a trail. Go ride up a big mountain, whatever, hang out. Go ride up the biggest mountain you can find, whatever it is. It's kinda like the modern day horseback riding almost. Like, for people who don't know about dirt bikes, like... there's nothing better than just getting on your bike and taking off, and going off some trail. It's the best. Motocross of Nations, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. Riders from across the globe representing their countries to compete for the coveted Chamberlain Trophy. For team USA, they came with passion in their hearts, and a fire in their belly seeking redemption. This last season was forcibly picked for the Mix of Nations team for USA. You know, I'm trying to embrace it as much as possible over here in the sand, riding and, every time I've been hit in the sand track is to try and be, uh, better and better. Each time I go out, I help my setup too. Obviously, coming over three weeks early was a huge commitment for myself and my team. And, uh, it just what we felt we needed to do to be competitive in this sand here in Holland. And, obviously, it's a race of, uh, attrition a little bit and a team race at the same time, but, um, I hope that we can really turn some heads. It's so different every day. Like, I don't even know if my style's good for it or bad for it. I'm just learning something new every day. We need to focus on getting a good start and being the best versions of ourselves, and not so much focusing on the pace or other guys or anything like that. The hardest track we've ridden over here would be the deepest... deeper than the deepest track in the States, so... it's not like you'd get these conditions even out of Nationals, so for it to be on a normal Wednesday or whatever in Holland is eye-opening. For the European Sand Dune, you know it's not easy for them to get that adapted. You know, it's so special and, uh, what I need to say that they were at their peak and, and really the effort they have been putting in, you know, and, the whole motocross community around the world should be, uh, proud of the US guys that they have put in this effort, you know, and came over to do this training. I don't really, you know, get into the free riding thing, or throwing webs or anything like that. That's just not who I am. For me it's those days where I'm just perfectly on the edge, and it feels easy. I like the, the cutting edge... what it takes, you know, all the training and everything that we do, what that can bring you, as far as focus, and, and ridingand how you feel on the bike, that supreme feeling. Actually, I'm really proud of them, because it was their idea to come over. The same track we started on is the same track that we finished on. And we were eight seconds faster at the end of three weeks then we were, so... we gave ourselves the best ability to, to do well here. So, I'm proud of the guys no matter what happens, and, uh, they've gained a lot of respect in the US. All in all, I think it was worth it. This race is a dream come true for me. As far as being on the team, uh, it was one of my first, uh, ambitions as a racer, so not only to make the team but to be the team captain is like a huge deal for me, and definitely a dream ticked off. It's gonna be interesting to see how things play out, but I think whenever the gate drops, we're all racers, and, uh, we'll figure out a way to get, uh, the best results that we can. In the end, Team Netherlands took victory on their home soil. Despite broken bones, busted bikes, and some bad luck Team USA never gave up and earned the respect of the world. One year later, Zach Osborne would go on to win the 2020 AMA Pro Motocross Championship. That's their motto, "Never say die." And that has gotten Zach Osborne to the 2020 Lucas Oil Pro Motocross 450 championship. The truth is I still love to ride. I mean, I truly enjoy what I do, and, um, looking forward it's gonna be a really hard chapter for me to ever, you know, fully close, because I just love what I do so much. Dream big is the moral of the story and don't ever give up. Find people that believe in you even when you don't and... just keep pressing on. Their motivation starts in their heart, but they must rise up. They watch and learn from those who came before them. So out here in Dade City, Florida. Chad Reed's old compound. Outdoor track, nice and long. We got two super-cross tracks, and honestly, just the place to be if you're coming out here and getting ready for outdoor nationals or super-cross. So, this place is great and, uh, yeah, looking forward to continuing my training here. For me, I now, starting out from, you know, one of the top guys in amateurs and now, kind of finding a place for myself in the pros. But if I put in the work and stuff like that, like, good things will come. And honestly, I'm just waiting on that. I know, uh, I'll start showing my real talent. Just waiting for that. Break-out ride. Hard enduro is known for being one of the most commanding disciplines in off-road, where skill, technique and control are paramount just to cross the finish line. In the world of hard enduro it's no wonder Graham Jarvis is known as the Godfather. So, I'm a hard enduro rider, but I started off 10 years old with trails. I did that for 20 years, got to number four in the world, and, uh, kind of got bored of that and ended up doing hard enduro. Just for fun initially. You know, quite some long distance events you have in England. Which are perfect for, you know, the single track riding and that adapted straight into hard enduro. I love the, uh, simplicity of the events, the races. You know, you just start and you get to the finish as quick as you can, and then the fastest guy is the winner. It's simple. And, them I just love the challenge of, you know, the technical riding, and there's so many variations, so many skills to learn and you can never get bored. So my biggest achievement in Hard Enduro is definitely the five wins in Erzberg and the six wins in Romania. Uh, they are the biggest races of the years I've won it multiple times. Uh, you know, and I have even surprised myself winning Erzberg at 44-years-old and uh, I'm still going. I try not to think about my age too much but uh, you know focus on the training, doing my job and if it's good enough to win, then I'm happy, but, uh, I do surprise myself sometimes that I am actually capable of winning at 44-years-old. And you know, the younger guyshaven't just annihilated me yet. Success isn't always measured in checkered flags. Comebacks show us that heart is where it all began... and heart is where it will always come back to. Every year I race, it just gets more difficult and more of a challenge. It's definitely been a life trial I guess you could say. Just to stay in the sport and be one of the top five, top 10 guys, It's just your whole life's commitment. It's the minute you wake up to the minute you go to sleep, you put everything into it, and I want to keep racing at a professional level and at the top level, I wanna be on a factory team and I think that's what always drives me, you know. Every day I'm at the track, I just put my all into it. With my riding, my training, my eating, my sleep, everything. I just try to make the most of it. That's all you can do. Supercross is so gnarly. We do 17 weekends in a row. One weekend off, we ride three days a week. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. We race on Saturday, it's just a lot riskier. I feel like a lot more calculation with rhythm sections and whoop sections and it can go really wrong, so it's very important to be smart and try and avoid big risk. You know, at the end of the day we are racing dirt bikes which is dangerous, and we truly accept that the worst could happen, but that's just part of the game and we still do it. I would definitely describe myself as a rider that likes to hang it out there. Most of the times, I'm pretty stable on the bike. I normally don't crash too much but I definitely like to hang it out there and I like to blow some bern stuff and just hold it wide open. My favorite thing to do on a bike is, uh... Yeah, for sure the whip is nice I like to float sideways. That's definitely a cool feeling like doing photo shoots and stuff and really whip it, but there's a special feeling when you just hit a rut or corner really nicely and that feeling, there's just no other like it. Yeah, obviously growing up in Tasmania, uh, it's like a small island just below Australia. It was pretty isolated there. My dad built a house all by himself. Till this day, it's still not finished. We didn't have any power, we had a generator for power and no flushing toilet, but we had two tracks and we literally just burnt fuel all day. Every day we could pretty much, if we got bored we'd just go out and ride or something like that. Go outside. In the end, I'm pretty grateful that we grew up like that. It's taught me a lot in life and to get through a lot of situations, you know, so, in the end of the day, I appreciate that and for sure me coming here, growing up like that has definitely helped me a lot. The best thing that I found riding in Europe is, yeah, you come here and it's a huge wake-up call when you go to a track that hasn't been prepped for three days. With 200 riders every day on it, so in the end, it teaches you a lot. And I would say that's the best part because that really helps you improve your riding and obviously physical. Back home, a lot of people don't really ride together or are scared to ride together. When you come here, and there's probably 10, 15 toes on the track every time you go riding. I liked the part of it more where it's not a secret for anyone and stuff like that. Where I found at home, everyone wanted to do their own little thing, or their own different way. So here, in the end, it's a lot more relaxing 'cause you know you're doing the same thing as everyone else. In Mantova, I got my first Moto win. The emotions that were going through that time were quite high but that's only because you see how much of effort you put in, and the dream when you were a little kid to come and race here and do well. For me that was quite big because all the hard work I went through to even get here, to then, the more hard work that I did to try and get on a factory team. It felt a little bit surreal that I was actually leading and coming across the rollers for the last time and just knowing that you have the Moto win is just crazy. I was already getting like, goosebumps when I was riding and stuff just before crossing the line. JED BEATON! When training for Motocross, it's easy to get lost in the program. Chasing the seconds off the clock. Sometimes, you gotta switch off and reset. Just go for a ride for the same reasons you started in the first place. To have fun. Yeah, so this is my backyard, it's cool to have a track to train at when times are tough and there's nowhere to ride. It's kind of like a hybrid track here. Little bit like Supercross feeling. It's got a little bit of outdoors up top and it's a really fun trackjust to practice some technique. I like the sound of the two strokes like, you're always on the rev limiter. It's always super high in rpm, and it just sounds really cool. That's why Iove the two strokes, and, uh, I know I'm gonna be bummed when the day comes I have to get off of them. My riding style, it's kind of a mix between like a freerider like Colby Raha, and like a racer. I'm kinda both. I know when to control, like I know I'm not to go throw an oppo in the race. So I know how to control it, but when I'm out having fun, I can't help myself but throw a few out there. Yeah, so, my buddy, Tai Hansen has a track, uh, about 15 minutes up the road. It's got some sandy silt, so it makes for some good berm shots. Oh, I love that place. I think the biggest sacrifice for me when I start professional racing was that I moved away from home in Latvia and moved to Belgium. And, you know, I'm living here completely alone, my family is back in Latvia. If you wanna be a top athlete and you wanna be the best, you have to sacrifice many things. That's why we do it, you know. We love Motocross, we love racing, that's part of our life. Yeah, being a professional Motocross rider for sure is tough. But, uh, that was what I was dreaming for, for all my life. You know, when I started racing, I really wanted to be in a factory team, and, uh, now I have reached that, I'm in MXGP class and, uh, racing for Husqvarna racing team. And it's for sure tough sometimes, but you know, that's what we love to do. The desert, the land of extremes. Where only the toughest can survive. With endless trails for the seeker in all of us. A place you'd truly be alive. You're just in fifth gear, wide open, and it's the most, like, peaceful feeling in your mind. When there's nothing goes around. You're just going as fast as you can. It's crazy how it makes you feel on the inside with the adrenaline hitting but it's like almost euphoric. It's like you're in your own world. Nothing else matters. Just the dirt bike, yourself and whatever is around you. There's a whole different sense of freedom to be able to do that on a dirt bike, and it's absolutely one of my most favorite things in the world. Anything can happen at any time. We're going so fast especially out in the desert. Even in the trees, like, anything can happen, so... There's always that risk but I feel like on the other aspect, it's so much fun. It's what I grew up doing, and I have so much passion and love for it. There's no risk that's gonna stop me from wanting to do this ever. I grew up racing against the boys back in Australia from the time I was three and I still get to do it now. Even, like, at the Finke desert race, I was in the men's 250 class. And to be able to go out there and come second against those guys. Not saying that the women are any slower but it's cool to put us up there in their overalls, and even nowadays, where the women are winning the overalls at the GNCC's. Against thousands of men. So that's super cool to get the respect now. And it's bringing more women into the sport and I love that. There's a lot of goals I've set myself over the years. But, uh, even moving here and winning the GNCCs. I've ended up having three back-to-back titles in the three years that I've been here. I have won a couple of ISDE world championships. But I still feel like I'm still getting started, I haven't reached everythin' that I want to do. And it's cool to be out and make new goals and see where I can push myself in the sport and do new things all the time which I'm really excited about the future coming up and see where we go.
