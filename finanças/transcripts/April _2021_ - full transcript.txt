April, it's your Aunt Rose, happy birthday. I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. Your mum would be so proud of you, she'd be so proud of the woman that you're becoming. Anyway, just gotta keep away from those boys. Happy birthday. Hello, David, I hope you've got my money. It's my daughter's birthday today. I-I just need a little bit more time, that's all. Banging on about time, time's up. You can't barge in here, look, excuse me. You don't understand. If you can't make arrangements to make this payment, I'm gonna rearrange your face. You can't take that. You can't take that, it's my wife's wedding ring. She don't need this. That'll do for now. There better be more. Do yourself a favor, pay up. Hey, hey, Myles. You can't just pick and choose, Vickie. I just-just-just need a little, you know? A little taster, yeah? Just need a little hit, you know? You made your bed, you can fucking lie in it, can't you? Myles, come on, I just need a little, just, just- - Here, I got a line for you. Come here, babe. Fucking state of that. Vickie the fucking Lickie. You got something, you got a little something? Yeah, I've got something. Are you hungry? So fucking hungry. - Yeah? - Hungry. I've got some food for you. But he's right, he's right, you left the family. It wasn't like that. I'm sorry, I just-just, if I could just, just one hit. One more, one more, yeah? Listen, you're gonna get back to work, yeah? But I want you to beg. Uh, Tommy, you're hurting me. And cluck like a chicken. Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck. Tommy. - Louder. - Cluck, cluck, cluck. Cluck! Cluck, cluck, cluck. Cluck! Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck. That's enough, that's enough. Just-just a hit. Now look. - Is that what you want? - Yeah. You're gonna go and see your old mate, Barry and then I'll sort you out later. Promise? Vickie the fucking Lickie. Shut up, Cole! Why didn't you tell me about the debt? Didn't want you to worry. Look, forget about that, come and sit down. It's your birthday. I'm sorry it's not wrapped, I spent all the money on the contents. Thanks, Dad. How did you know I wanted these ones? I'm a dad, I know everything. - Oh, thanks. - Happy birthday, Princess. Thanks, Dad. Listen, you'd best get off, sweetheart. Don't want you being late for school. Yeah, when I say Monday, I don't mean fucking mean Thursday, do I, Moby, fucking- What the fuck are you doing? Didn't mean to bother you, mate. No, you fucking don't. Yeah, don't fuck about with Monday. I'm telling you Monday, Thursday don't fucking work for me, man, I've got shit to be doing. - Please, what? - Drop the hands, come on. That's it, smile. Too bad. - No, stop, please. - Yeah yeah, yeah yeah. - Yes, you can. - Please? Come on. Where's it going? - It's just- - You're just gonna keep it. Yeah, come on. Fucking cunt! Give me that. Myles, what-what are you doing? Fucking sit down, yeah! That cost me a fortune, mate. Come on, you fucking cunt. What? What the fuck are you doing lurking round here? I didn't realize I was on tag. It's not like that. Yeah, you keep your fucking eyes off her, yeah? Or I'll gouge your fucking eyes out! Understand me? Yeah. You'd better. - You stay away from her. - I was just passing by. I only gave her a ciggie. You keep your fucking hands off her. In fact, I don't wanna see you round here ever again. - Understand? - Yeah. - Understand? - Yeah. Do you see your legs? Fucking use them. You know, you don't eat the cake, Myles, but you serve it up. What's your problem? What the fuck are you doing around here with your tits hanging out? Cover yourself up, fucking naughty people about. That's how it goes, is it? You come back and suddenly you call the shots, mate? Yeah, well, I'm not your mate, am I? You're so controlling. You're just like him. Fuck off, Sarah. I'm nothing like him. What have you been doing anyway? Just working. - Doing what? - Just bits and bobs. Like? Fuck off, Mum. What have you been doing anyway? Same old. Does it make you happy then? What does? Your job. Pays the bills, don't it? Why is it always about money with you? It's not gonna fix anything. Nobody does bits and bobs, goes from doing fuck-all in his life to getting anything he wants. What's your secret? Sometimes people have to do things that they don't like, Sarah, you know. So who's got a gun to your head? Oh shut up, you're giving me an headache. I hear things. You shouldn't believe everything you hear, should you? Don't worry, it's nothing bad. I've got a party later, might be fun. Hm, well, just be careful, watch your drink. What do you mean? I mean sometimes, boys will do anything to get what they want, hm? What, like sex? Ah, yeah, yeah. That's my mate, I've gotta go. You're proper fucked up, but I love you. See you. I'll be watching you. Watch yourself. Pick your things up, Jake. You know they cost a lot of money, look at this mess. Look, I'm trying to watch the box and all I've got is your fat arse going in and out of the screen. Why don't you have a jog in the park? Get rid of some of that flab, make me sick looking at you. Women, boy, they do your fucking head in. You're gonna be like your old dad though, aren't you, ey? Look at me. Look at me! Oh, we've got a you an'all, have we, ey? Yeah, go on, get out of my sight, go on! Fucking fairy! See what you influence? Vince, he's just a baby. That hole in your head is for one thing, so shut it. I don't raise faggots. It's just men in this household. Here he is. Come here. Come here. Cunt. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa what's the matter? Nothing, I'm glad you're here. Sorry, mate, I've er, I've just missed you, innit? Why aren't you out there with your mates, anyway? They've gone out with their family. Family time, ey? Look, I'm not here anymore, so it's your job to keep the family safe, alright, Jake? I do, look at my muscle. I mean, wow, yeah, have you been working out, mate? I wanna be like you. Listen, Jake, you don't need to be anyone else. Just be yourself. Yeah. Understand? Alright. It's like looking in the mirror, but without the stupid face. Got a little bit more ink, have you, make you look tough? Oi, the other one's here! Hello, son. Do you think we look alike? You have the same eyes. New rule, after today, you are not welcome. Tough shit. Are you talking back to me, boy? Yeah, I'm talking. One breath and you'll feel the back of my hand. Well, come on! Fucking blink! Leave it out, Vince. Yeah, you're nothing but a pussy. The apple hasn't got far to fall, but I don't see it. Me neither. Well, don't stand there looking like a fucking killer. You've got about as much killer in you as a fucking fart! You're as limp as a faggot's cock who can't fuck a whore! Go and put the fucking dinner on! Like the place? Makes it more homelier, doesn't it? You can't hide behind the color, Mum. It's fine, I'm used to this. Ain't it about time you got out? That's some fat chance. So what are you gonna do, just sit around for the next show? No, I'm sticking around in my home, bringing up my children the best way I can. Have you come here to have a go at me? 'Cause I get enough of that from him in there! You have no idea what it's like to be trapped. Yes, I fucking do! Let's not forget that I was a part of this once. I have seen things, seen things that a child shouldn't fucking see, Mum. I know. We can't change the bad, but we could stop doing more of it. I'm sorry, son, I know that doesn't take it away, but it's a start. I've told you, you don't worry about my life, worry about yours and who you are. I'm worried about Jake. He hasn't got a choice like you do. Have you seen Chelsea? What's the girl's problem? What is it that you've done so bad? Don't know. You're my son, regardless of what you've done, I will always love you. Here he is. Don't you think he's got big, Myles? Do you think he's got all grown up? He's just like you when you was that age, always banging yourself. Listen to me, Jake, go to your room, play your computer and put your fucking headphones on, alright? Go. What the fuck? Don't be silly, I couldn't let that- - You let it happen before! So why don't you shut the fuck up about nothing gets past you, ey? If it wasn't him giving me a clump, it was fucking you, wasn't it? I, through this, have love, so you don't know anything about that bastard in there. You fucking won't get anymore. Myles. All I have left is the respect for my children. If that's gone, I might as well not be here. That's why I'm asking you to remember he's your father. Fuck. You've been busy? Birthday girl, ey? You wanna watch this one, Myles, she might catch you out. How's about next time, you just give me the information and be on your fucking way, right? What makes you think there's gonna be a next time? Thinking of having a go, are you? You fancy dipping your toe in the other side? I ain't like you, mate. That's what they all say. Oh and you dropped this last time I saw you. Cute. Alright. Let's have a look then. She goes to your school. I grew up with this girl, that's-that's my best friend. Nice, get it done. Myles, I-I can't do that. Look, don't fuck with me, Chloe, yeah? Just, just tell Grant. Look, there's no fucking just about it, alright? She's been selected. Myles, I'm begging you, I can't do that to her. That girl's been through hell already, I can't do that to her, anyone, but not her, I won't do it. Yeah, you've got no choice, Chloe, have you? Otherwise he's gonna come down on someone - that you fucking love. - I'm not doing it. Just tell her, that you know someone that has changed your life for the better, hm, and I'll do the rest. Hm? You know this works, Chloe, 'cause if you don't, you may find yourself back in the gutter, the choice is yours. We can't change the bad, but we could stop doing more of it. We so nearly got caught. I did say I'd get those things, Juice. Well, if you turned up to class more often, maybe you would. What have you guys been getting up to then? - Oh, science test. - Oh my gosh, don't even, yeah. I had to go and speak to Mr. Jones about that. No, I don't think so. - Yeah, yeah, see you. - Bye. April, is there anyone in the bathrooms? No. It's not a big deal, right, I know this guy and sometimes he gives me jobs to do. What jobs? If I tell you, you can't tell anyone, - you have to promise. - I promise. Promise. It's not a big deal, right, I just, I smuggle some drugs. - What? - Ssh! Do you know how dangerous that is? But I got away with it, I made two grand, April. Do you know what we can do with that? Drugs? Yeah and other things sometimes. Look, I've been doing this a while now. Got one? No. What you doing here, ey? Well, I've got to say, yous two don't half look dodge, don't you? Who's the new squeal? Don't worry, just the new kid on the block. I thought I'd take him on a little detour, you know, show him some of the scum on the streets. Yeah, well, they'd better not be too enthusiastic, know what I'm saying, Piggy? It's double next time. - Dickhead. - I think you'll find you're the dickhead, you little maggot. Now how about you get out of this car and I make an example out of you in front of my new boy, ey, fancy that? - Just chill, man, be easy. - Yeah, I'll be easy, when I stick this right up your rear end, right up your black fucking box. Try and be a little bit more discreet, Myles, your name keeps popping up. And as for you, Cole, don't forget to pick up your arsehole and get out of this motor. Cheerio. He'll be laughing on the other side of his face, when I serve him up, fucking prick. All good? Yeah. Just some local rats. You've got to know how to control these animals. I'm really busy actually. I can't believe I'm not gonna see you tomorrow, I know, I'm so sorry. I haven't seen my cousin in ages though. I know. Can't get out of it again, so. Anyways, look, listen, yeah, um, - this is for you. - Fuck, Chloe? Turn around. No, seriously though, look, happy birthday. Alright, I love you, I've got to go, I'm sorry I can't come. I've been, um, meaning to ask you about the marks on your arm. Oh, um, no, that's, um, that's nothing, it's just Molly, like she's getting like proper vicious lately. Right, I've gotta go, love you. Chloe. Oi, piece of trash! Oi, heard it's your birthday today? What's Daddy gonna get you, hm? Apple and a pair of socks? And what about Mummy? Oh, I forgot, she's- - Don't talk about my mum. Who the fuck are you pushing? Don't talk about my mum like that ever. Who the fuck are you pushing? Come here. Girls, oi, oi, break it up. You ask what's in her bag! - Do one! - Sod off. You alright? Yeah. Listen, you don't have to walk home on your own, if you don't want to, I'll give you a lift if you want. It's alright, I'll walk. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Because if you go home in a little bit of a state to your dad, how's that gonna make me feel, alright? I just don't like seeing girls upset. Tell you what, why don't me and my chauffeur drive alongside you as you walk on your own, that way I know that you get home safe, yeah? Yeah. Deal? Yeah. Cool. Come on then. This your house then, yeah? Yeah. Listen, if you need anything and I mean anything, just give me a shout, yeah? I got you something. Happy birthday. Why did you get me a card? How did you know it's my birthday? Just a little something my mum taught me before she went away, a lie. Thanks, Myles. See you later. Hi sweetheart. Hey, Dad. - How was school? - It was good. Who was that? Just a friend. I told you if you need picking up to just give me a call. You're getting to that age now and these boys, especially ones like that- - What do you mean? Dinner will be ready soon. It's alright, Dad, I'm around boys all day. Pretty girl, she should do well. So tell me, this girl, have you done your research? There ain't gonna be no dramas, Grant. You know it's all in the selection. Can't have no live wires. That ain't gonna happen again. She ain't got no brothers, she lives with her dad. They're in debt. You know, guys fall in love with what they see, girls falls in love with what they hear. Tell that girl what she want to hear, make love to her mind and her body will follow. You stay on top of things and one day you ll be sitting on this side of the table. Did I do good? It was too good. You'd best get going, you've got another session. Myles, I-I don't feel well. Like I said, I think you should get going. Better get changed out of my uniform then, ey? No, you don't, he wants you in your uniform. Okay, I'd better get going then, alright. Hm. Don't come in me, Cole. Nothing I checked, all clear to deal with. And don't contact me until the job's done. And if you get clocked. If she gets clocked, what? Hm? Look, I ain't about having to get messy again, alright. Well, our Chloe ain't like that, is she? Listen, you don't fucking touch her like that again, do you understand me, yeah? Hm? Are you sure you're alright? Yeah. Good. Collect yourself and do your fucking business, darling, yeah? Yeah, good girl. She's been selected. Just tell her that you know someone that has changed your life for the better. You know how this works, Chloe. Hey, April, I just thought I'd give you a call, I've been, ah, thinking about you quite a bit. Yeah, you seem to have, you know, left a bit of an imprint. I don't know, you know, we're, ah, we're friends right, but there's something special about you. Yeah, you've got that light in your eyes. But um, listen, I heard about your dad having troubles with debt and stuff. I just wanted to let you know that I've sorted it, I've sorted it for you. I wanna be there for you, you know? For all of you, through the good and the bad. So yeah, I'll meet you after school, but you need to, ah, you need to understand that this needs to be really hush hush. I'm quite a private guy, you know. You understand, right? Bye, chat to you later. Bye. How's she getting on? She's doing alright, Tommy, she's coming on just fine. You know, there's money in what we do with these girls, but there's more money in boys. You're sick, bruv. Sick? No, we're all the same. Oh, liven up, Myles. Blame yourself, mate. I mean, it ain't my fault you couldn't stand up your old man when he was knocking your mum about. That's why I'm asking you to leave it. Remember he's your father. Go on, Myles, go and get the correcter, 'cause you're gonna need correcting, ain't you? What do you want now? It'd better be fucking worth it. I just like, just come to see how she's doing. She ain't stopped talking about you. Well then, you've got your answer then. But it's a bit difficult listening to my mate rattle off about how into you she is, not knowing the truth. So what are you saying? Look, just keep your fucking gob shut. I don't want to have to tell Grant, that we've got someone we need to worry about. These are people's lives. Fucking listen, listen carefully. This job, yeah, keeps you fed, keeps you clothed. You want out? Well, take a walk to Grant, but I guarantee you'll be floating down the Thames by the morning. I'm telling you once, go away. - I just wanna talk. - Look, you can throw all the excuses that you want, but it doesn't change what you are or what you've done. Look, this ain't about me and you. I'll call the police and you really don't want that. Oh, the good, old police? Look, just come out from behind the door, Chelse. No, sorry, don't trust you. God knows what you're capable of. I've told you, that's not me. Do you know what? Are you fucking deluded? You've gone, mate, you're fucking warped. You could be a liar, a cheat, a bully, but what you do, that is summat else, that I don't want my son doing. Our son. Do you see what you do? I just wanna see my son, Chelse. You're not needed here anymore, go away. Buying your love? I wonder where you get that from. Just take it. I don't want your filthy fucking money! Your money can't dry the tears of the people's lives that you are destroying. Do you not fucking get it? It doesn't matter where you go, this is gonna follow you everywhere. You can't run away from it, Myles, because it's in you, it's infected in your blood. And let's be honest, what kind of dad are you gonna be anyway? You see a pound sign in everything. I don't know, maybe one day, when it happens to someone that you love, you'll feel summat, but until then, you're numb, dumb, you're fucking rotten to the core. Now get the fuck out of my life! Go on then. Do it! That's not me. It's not me. It's only a matter of time, before it's on the list though, innit? There is no good in you, Myles, I feel sorry for you and your fucked up family. Just fuck off, please. Oi, you, mate? Oi! Why are you boys running off like that, ey, man? They're scared. You scared of us? No. This kid's brave, yo, we should give you a slap. - I'll slap you back. - What? Yo, chill, bruv, chill, bruv. What are you getting brave for? My mum says, "Don't let anyone hit you, no matter how big they are." Come here, young blood. You know who I am then? Everyone knows you. Why are you walking round in dusty crips, yeah? My mum can't buy me new ones. You seen this car? Seen my man's watch? Alright, I might have a job for you. Go to the list of these addresses, yeah? Come back here, eight o'clock, I'll have your brand, spanking pair of trainers, how does that sound? Run. I want that all gone. You don't come back 'til it's all shifted, do you understand? Do you understand? What's funny? Nothing. Nothing. Ask him why he's laughing at me. Ask him. What are you... Ask him. Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a joke? Oh, come on, T, man, allow him. Do you think I'm a joke? Laugh now, go on. You think, you think, you think I'm fucking messing about right now? Listen to me, oi, listen to me, you're in my fucking yard, bruv, yeah, in my yard, you do as I say, do you understand? Do you understand? 'Cause I swear I'll break you, man. Yeah? Get the fuck out and shift the gear now! It's sweet, Alex, man, yeah, it's cool, man. Alright. Come here. I want you to look after him, yeah? We're family. You know what? I find you really interesting, you know that? I shouldn't really say this, but you've been on my mind all day. Haven't you got a beautiful smile as well? Stop it. You know what, let me take a photo of you, let me have a photo of that smile. No. Come on. Smile. There we go. Listen. I need to ask a favor, I know we're not like that, but I... I need to get it done tonight. I've got to go visit my nan in hospital, you know and she ain't got long. I ain't got no one else to ask. I would ask Cole, but you know. You know, I can't ask you to do that, look, I'm sorry. I'll do it. Are you sure? Right, yeah, I'll text you the address, alright? Yeah. Yeah? You're so beautiful, you know. - You're special. - Just shut up. I'm here to see Tommy. Who is it? A newbie. I've got a package for Tommy. So you must be April then? Yeah. Bruv. Move out of the way, move out of the way. Got anything on you, no? Look. - It's alright. - Look. Yeah, she's fine. Oh. There you go. What are you doing here? - I was just helping a friend. - Just go, you're too young for this, look at me. Is this what you want to do yourself? Do this? - Just go, just go. - Okay, I'm going. - Just go. - Hang on a minute, hang on. You'll go when I tell you to go. I want her. Is she experienced? How much is she? Five pills. You wanna have sex with her, it's gonna cost you more. She's a virgin. Babe, look, go and, go and make me something to eat, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? What are you still doing here? Oh, I was leaving. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think you want something. - No. - Yeah. No. - No? - No. I know what you want. Hey, what you doing? Ah, argh! Hold on a minute, he did what? I'm not having that. For fuck's sake! Oh, shit, shit, shit. I'm sorry you had to go through that, babe. You must've been so scared. No one does that to my girl. My girl? Yeah, you are my girlfriend, right? Yeah, I mean, I don't know what that means, - I don't understand- - It means that I take care of you. Look, I know this is gonna sound really stupid again, I've been with quite a lot of women and no one, I mean no one has ever made me feel the way that you make me feel. I got you something. Now, here's the hard bit, I always struggle with these. And that is for you. Thank you, I love it. Just try and relax, yeah, stay calm. I'm sure she'll be fine. This isn't like her, she would never do this. Yeah, I know the feeling. She's 15, right? Yeah. What was you doing at 15? Think about it. What? She's probably out there now getting knocked. She's probably round her boyfriend's, that's all. How dare you talk about my daughter like that. I'm making a complaint. We'll process that accordingly. It will need to be processed down at the station now. However, I do have some questions for you about Myles Coleridge. Where on earth have you been? We've been worried sick. My phone died and the trains were slow, I'm sorry. April. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry we wasted your time. No, no, that's fine, I'm glad she's safe. Excuse me, miss, I have some questions for you. What is it that you've done so bad? Do you think we look alike? You can't run away from it, Myles, because it's in you, it's infected in your blood. Ah! You're numb, dumb, you're fucking rotten to the core. Now get the fuck out of my life! What's up? April, I don't want you seeing that guy anymore. Why? That's the end of it. Well, he's a friend. What's a man like that doing wooing little girls anyway? I'm not a little girl. - Yeah. - You know nothing about him. Look, sweetheart, I saw you in the car with him. I didn't come over, because I didn't wanna embarrass you, but something doesn't feel right, April, something's off. You know what? For the first time in a long time, I feel happy. Why you going soft, babe? Do you think I'm a fucking faggot? - Ey? - No, I was... Do you think we're here for a fucking chitchat? Ey, do you? You come here, you get fucked and then you get paid. That's it, understand? Hm. Hm? Good. Now finish off. Maybe one day, when it happens to someone that you love, you'll feel summat. Tommy! It's not fucking all sorted, babe! Don't start that, don't, don't fucking start all that with me. We'll see someone go. - Yeah. - Yeah, like we do, yeah? Mm-hm. Shut up crying. Shut up! April. - Hey. - Hey, Chlo. - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm alright, you? Yeah. Look, I wanted to talk to you actually, but I, I've been trying to find the right time. He's always there, isn't he? Mate, what are you doing? What? You and Myles. You don't know what you're getting yourself involved with. What are you trying to do, Chloe? Break me and Myles up? Yeah, I am, I'm trying to help my friend. - You're not together. - Yes, we are. Shows how much you know, I'm his girlfriend. No, not in his head. Look, you don't know him like I do. I wish I'd never told you about anything I was doing now. He's my boyfriend, you're just jealous of us, you don't like it that he wants to be with me. You are so wrong. You don't know nothing. He's 27-years old, April and it gets better. That little bracelet he gave you, he gave me one as well, told me I was special and I was beautiful and all the rest of that crap. You ain't special to him, - you're one of many. - You know what? If you're just trying to ruin my life, - then you can't be in it. - No. For the first time, I feel wanted. Well, he's been there for me, he's been helping me. - That's not true, is it? - Just leave me alone. I don't wanna hear this anymore. - April, listen to me. - I don't want to. I'm starting to see more and more of you, Myles. In all my wisdom, that is not a good sign. What can I do for you? Tommy's being a bit rough with the girls. That's the process. It's always been that way, you know this. Sometimes the girls, they need a clump. Tommy's got the right attitude. Get April through her first round, once she get hook, job done, move on. There ain't nothing new here, Myles. I er, I was thinking of taking a little break, Grant. No problem, nice to have a holiday. Give you some time to reflect on that attitude of yours. It's not like I don't appreciate all you've done, you know that, I just need to sort my life out. Your life is sorted, it got sorted, when I sorted it. You need to sort out your emotions, you sound like a girl. Don't worry, Grant, I just think- - No, no, no, no, we both been rocked now, park your arse. Hello, Chloe, April's not here. No, um, I didn't come to see April actually, David, I wanted to come and talk to you about something. It's April, she isn't safe. What do you mean? Where is she? No, I don't mean like that and I don't know right now, but she's not safe being with Myles. Look, this is Myles' address, okay, you didn't get it from me though. He's dangerous, you're gonna have to get her away from him, but I don't know how you're gonna do that, she's too far in now. What do you mean too far in? Chloe, Chloe, Chloe. Get off me, David. I've known you for years, come on, you've known me since you were a little girl. Tell me please. Please, come on. Sex, drugs, she's doing wrong, David. What? I need to go now. This girl, April, you feel something toward her? Don't be stupid, Grant. Look at me, is she different? She's just a job. You know, I wasn't born on a fucking banana boat. You want out? You used to be mustard. Now you're turning into this American, pickled, watered down hot dog shit, sweet, but no heat. You grew a conscience. I saved you, more, did you a soft scheme into metal, changed your tears for power and now you wanna walk? These are people's lives, Grant. Tell our Myles about your life, Cindy, before you met me. The guy seem like him forget. I had nothing, Myles, bouncing around from home to home. I'd sell sex for a score. And now she gets fucked and gets tenfold. You see what I do with people's lives? Say it! My life's better now. Fuck, you get me all passionate. You can walk, but what about your family, ey, Myles? Your mummy, Sarah, little Jake, what if you find them in a bag? Whoa, fuck me. Someone's lit a match under your arsehole, Grant and there was me thinking you'd lost it, ey? Ah, oh, hello, who's this one then? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Give us a little dance. This one on the house, is it? Sure. Cool. Sweetheart. I'll stick it right up the back there. You're a bit quiet, Myles. You in the doghouse, are you? Here, that old man still throwing hands, is he? - Hm. - What can I do for you? You can start by upping my lolly. That's something we need to talk about. That's what I'm here for. You see, I want fucking double. That's not how it works. Listen, don't forget yourself. Things are getting a bit top heavy down the Old Bill station, if you know what I mean. You should know a good thing when you have it. I don't want fucking good, I want better. Seems like you want to bite the hand that feed you. You get a haircut and forget your place. Yeah, well, you'd best not forget- - I'd slow yourself down. Yeah, well, I think it's you forgetting. See, your world's gonna crumble. All your dirty, little, fucking secrets are gonna float off like fucking boat floats and you'll be left with fuck all. So... Am I getting it or what? Yeah, you're gonna get it. Oh, what the fuck, what the fuck, Grant? Ssh! There's only one way in, Myles and one way out. Do what you do best, you understand? Ah! April's dad. What can I do for you? Where's my daughter? No idea, mate. April, April! Stop. Look, you can do whatever it is you wanna do, alright, but I want you to stay away from my daughter. Cool. Okay. Does your daughter really wanna stay away from me, hm? I'm not ideal, I know that, but I ain't the worst. We're in the jungle, mate and I'm just one of the tigers, yeah. I know all about you, I'll call the police. Oh, yeah? And how's that working out for you, ey, hm? S-stay away! How you doing, Alex? Alright. Hm, scooch up. How's your mum? She's alright. How's the trainers keeping? - Nice. - Do you like them? Yeah. So I've one more thing for you to do and if you do this for me, level two is completed. Make sure you get a high score. - Okay. - Hm? I'll text you in a bit, alright? Be good. Are you gonna answer that? No, it's probably my dad. I'll just call him later, I'm with you. He probably just wants to know that you're safe. Yeah, but I am safe. She's not answering. David, listen to me. She's just at that age, do you remember what I was like? Yeah, but this is different, I can't take this, Rose. Come here, come here, it's gonna be alright. It's gonna be alright. You look worried, Chlo. I just feel so bad. Look, she'll come round in the end. You've got to look after number one, just like you did. You don't know her like that. She ain't like me. Just thought I'd bring you drinks up. Thanks. Hm, hm, hm. Chloe. Chloe, get your fucking arse in here right now! Right fucking now! Get our special girl ready for fucking work. What, what do you mean work, Myles? You've got a fucking client waiting. What does, what does that mean? What? What are you fucking whatting? Myles, what are you talking about? - Myles, you're scaring me. - You've got a fucking client. Do you remember your first time? Do you remember your first time, Chloe? - Yes, Myles, yes, yes. - How was it, babe? How fucking was it? - Fine, fine. - Yeah? She'll get fucking used to this, right? - Sort her out. - Myles. Myles, what do you mean client? No, get off me. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing it! What, you fucking are! - I can't, I can't. - Stop, stop, you do, you do. No, I'm not doing it! Stop, stop, stop, it's alright, it's alright, don't, stop. Sit down. It's gonna be alright. - It'll be alright, ssh! - I'm not living like that. - Ssh, ssh! - We're meant to be- - Ssh, you have to calm down. I have had e-fucking-nough! Chloe, I fucking warned you! Fucking bitch! Fucking Tom! Stop! - Shut your fucking face! - Myles! Shut your fucking face! Fucking bitch! No! I fucking warned you, girlie! I fucking warned you! I know this guy and sometimes he gives me jobs to do. Alright, I just don't like seeing girls upset. You're getting to that age now and these boys, especially ones like that. You don't know him like I do. Fuck's sake! I've fucking had enough of the lot of you, fucking cunts, you silly, fucking tart. Stay, get out, fuck off! You can't run away from it, Myles, it's infected in your blood. What about your family? What if you find them in a bag? What kind of dad are you gonna be anyway? There is no good in you, Myles. I fucking warned you, didn't I, you fucking tart, ey? You have the same eyes. You're just like him. - Myles. - Fucking don't, Mum, I'm gonna deal with this cunt. Go on then, fucking blink. Uh! You fucking cunt, come on then! Fucking come on! Uh! - Come here. - Uh! Uh! Now who's being corrected? Myles! Stop, stop! Please for Mummy! Myles, Myles, stop! Get off! - Myles, stop! - Stop! Jake, look at me, look at me. That man is a fucking monster, he is everything and I mean everything that you don't wanna be. - Do you understand? - Yes. Now go to your room. Do something, Myles, do something. I just did. Please do it! Do it! You know, you don't eat the cake, Myles, you serve it up. Yeah, ah, bring her to me. Myles. What's so important, you bring me out in this weather? That thing better be loaded. Think you have the guts? What makes you think you can pop me here and walk away alive, ey? Yous a monster, Myles, but you're no killer. There's only one way in, Myles. And one way out. Sorry for what I've done. I can't change the bad, but I can stop doing more of it.
