I was born gay, no doubt about it. And later, when I started to have experiences with girls, I turned even more gay. I liked it. I like women a lot. A lot. I like making love to women. Don't you? When you think of me, Dolores, when I'm no longer around, you'll remember me like this, floating. Floating, floating. BOY AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM HELP ME They need me at the office to check some blueprints. Can you go alone? I'll catch up with you later. My child embraces me. Who's innocent? Nobody is. Why am I scared if the worst is over? I want the world to stop. I want everything to freeze. Death is God's greatest betrayal. Hello. How is it going? Okay, so far. You took my suitcase. I have yours. Oh, well. When are you coming? Maybe tomorrow... As soon as I finish. It's blown. Blown? You blew the engine. Where can I spend the night here? Everything is sold out. But there's a hotel close by. Ask for Margot. She might help you out. I can take you. I'd rather walk if it's not too far. Follow that road. At the end, take a left. Thanks. Where did you send her? To Margot's. God bless you. - Bye! - Goodbye! See you soon! Bye! - Hello. - Hello. Could I rent a room for the night? Sorry, we're sold out. My car broke down, and the mechanic said you'd help me. - What's your name? - Eva. One night. Yes, one. Hello. I'm fine. Something to do with the engine. I didn't make it to Los Juanes. I'm at another hotel. Are you okay? You beat me, but you're dead! Want some? Look how fat you are, piggy. How are you, darling? Fine, Mom. I couldn't sleep last night thinking of you. I don't know why you went to that beach. Your father says... I don't care what he says. Talk to him, please. Do it for me. For you? Come see me, mom. I can't. One, two, three, four... One more day, one day less... How many do I have left? Thirty? Forty? Fifty? God doesn't exist, numbers do. They are infinite, they never end. Why do I? Are you crazy? Would you like to die slowly? What are you doing here? This is private property. Yours? Talk to Margot. She rented me the room. You live in a fairy tale, don't you? How original. My husband tells me that all the time. See? That's what husbands are for, being sensible. Where is he? In Caracas. Oh, wow. Want to have dinner with us? We're having fish, but I didn't kill it. Here, heatstroke kills. Let's go, Lola. - Where were you? - Fishing. With the guest from the pink cabin? - Are you spying on me? - Did you like her? She's not my type. What is your type, me? Dolores is my friend so scram. I didn't know you were in the Opus Dei. What got into you? You rented a room to a straight woman? Straight? I invited her to dinner. Are you insane? We came here for privacy. Who knows what she's like. You might change her mind. Isn't that your thing? In one day? People can change in 24 hours. - In Jupiter! - Don't get her going, Any! - You're testing me. - 24 hours? 1,444 minutes? Three days and she's in my bed. What do you want to bet? A bottle of Veuve Cliquot. Leave that woman alone. - Are you jealous? - Why would I be? I'm famous in this country. I don't want her talking... ...shit. Being gay is shit? In this country it is. And you'll introduce me as your personal secretary. So personal they work together in bed. How about cousin to change it up a bit? - Cheers. - Cheers. Three days. No thanks. Would you like to have another kid? One that's yours and mine. And who will have it? You or me? Can you imagine me with a belly? You'd look beautiful. Okay, I'll think about it. Meanwhile, why don't we start practicing? Because I have to make dinner for Liz's guest. How could she? By the way, hasn't Liz been acting strange? Honey, Liz is strange. I don't mean that. I mean... She's very defensive, distant. Like she's hiding something from me. Do you think Liz is being weird? We're all weird. Even the fish lady who smokes upside down. Heels on the beach, Coqui? Heels are the road to success. If you don't fall on your face first. These are my friends Alex and Any. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome. That's Coqui. And the one with the sunglasses, Doly. You want a drink? Hey, I own the bar tonight. Whisky, vodka, beer, rum? One has to celebrate when on vacation. You don't need an excuse to celebrate. I drink responsibly and without guilt, to quote the great Dr. Jahn. Are you Doctor Jahn? The writer? Nice to meet you. Please don't be so formal. It makes me feel old. What do you do? I work at a children's books publisher. My husband is busy, but he'll be here soon. Are you guys married? I've never been married. I have, but don't even remember. I married an old man to leave Cuba. Divorced, with two kids on vacation with their dad. Otherwise, they live with us. - And you Liz? - Me? I've been married so often I've lost count. Hear that, Dolores? You don't count. They were married for two years. And she almost killed herself when Liz dumped her. Oh, shit, I screwed up. Stupidity is not a crime. Please, she's straight, not dumb. We're not here to hide. We do it enough out there. Excuse me. What's buga? The opposite of gay. Black or white. Straight or gay. There are shades of grey, but they don't seem to count. Tell me about Dolores Jahn. She's quite the character. We were together. I cheated on her and she never forgave me. That's understandable. No. Faithfulness is not about sex, is about feelings. They know better, right, Lola? I gave my son one just like it. You have a son? Tommy. He's gone. She survived! I'm so embarrassed. I could kill both you and Liz. Good morning. The sun came up after a stormy night. Want us to take you to your car? Thanks, Liz already offered. Not on her motorcycle. Too many drunks around. They're sleeping off their hangover. You sound like her mother. Makes you look old. You wish you'd look this good when you're my age. Excuse me. Next year I'll write a book about female homosexuality. You won't be able to stay in the closet. - Why? I'm a researcher. - Up close and personal? No one buys a book about dykes, unless it's super hot. Ten percent of humans are gay. Statistics. Including the ones in the closet? If we count them, it's 30%. Thank God you're leaving. One more day and my dog dumps me for you. I thought they were faithful. Keep it. I'm off to the keys. Want to come? And the mechanic? You really think Juan has your car ready? - Do you dive? - Me? I barely float on an inflatable mattress. You just have to dive without drowning. Can you manage? Aren't your friends coming? Are you scared? I don't have a bathing suit. I have an extra one. She got her on the boat! Damn, it's going to rain. Drop it. She's too busy to answer. What's so bad about rain? She's not made of sugar. Let me try. Don't worry, it'll pass. It's just a tropical storm. You are not feeling well. I have a headache. It won't last. Did you bring aspirin? No. How about some rum? You want a head massage? Sometimes it works. What's with the scar? Appendicitis gone wrong. But I survived. Did you like it underwater? A lot. Why don't you stay longer? No way. The water is too choppy. There are many keys where to stay. Relax. Liz knows what to do. Are you asleep? No. What are you thinking about? It was peaceful underwater. Come. Lay down. Liz is 36, but still behaves like a teenager - She's always been this way. - No. Then you don't know her. Better than you. And I survived her. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? Are you okay? I'm great, but you look like a wreck. What happened? The engine failed. - And Liz had a bad headache. - Really? Stay and I'll give you a discount. I'd love to, but I have to go. You can't refuse a toast. - Cheers. - Cheers. Who's she? The one that got away, dragging her bags just like you. Thanks. Hop on. Never been on a bike? You'll like it. Come. And my bag goes on my head? Leave it, you'll pick it up later. Place your feet here. Just like that. Now hang on tight. Squeeze like on a horse. What's up? You promised it'd be ready. - I'll grab some tools. - Sure. When are you coming by? You know I don't believe in that. That was some pothole. Really, Juan... blown? It's not so bad. The engine's not blown? Who told you that story? What are you doing? Who's going to fix it? You or me? Try it. Thanks. Looking hot! Hey, carpet munchers! No place for me? Take her to the room! Quite an impression you're leaving with. Take care. Where's my bottle? A night on a deserted island is not enough? Did something happen? No. So? You cheater! Here. - And Doly? - In her room. - You argued again? - You noticed? There are some things I need to work out. Will you be hearing from Eva? - Exchanged numbers? - No. Too bad, I liked the girl. You didn't fancy her a bit? You fall in love, you lose. - And if you don't? - You have a ball. Is it that silliness Dolores loves so much? No. I have other attributes. I'm nice, smart, generous... Slutty. Two soulmates just found each other. Don't. Don't forget you owe me a bottle. We said three days. Are you doing some magic? Because she's gone, bye! I want champagne for my birthday. What do you want from me? You ever quit? No. What are you doing here? I came to see you up close. Since you're in the middle of Dolores and me, the only way to get rid of you is to get you in the middle. You get me? Go away, Coqui. Go away. Should I stop? I know you like me, I've seen you staring at my ass. I'm going to report you. To the National Guard? Don't you feel guilty? Life's too short. Give me that. Enjoy turning 37. It's all downhill after 40. Hello. Where are you? A miracle! That's Changó, the little devil is up to no good. Hey, Changó. Start chilling my bottle. It's on hold until you go for the kill. Come here. How are you feeling? Great. Tell me the truth. You're not taking care of yourself. I prefer quality time over quantity. Both count. In a perfect world, but this isn't. You don't think about those who love you. And who thinks about the departed? So quickly forgotten. Fortunately. Harsh. I'm not harsh, and I do think about those who love me. And I think about you, going thru this alone out of loyalty. I did love you. But I'm no good. Tell me you'll miss me. Liz is leaving us. What do you mean? The cancer is back. She's going to die. Why didn't you tell me? She asked me not to. Don't get the wrong idea. It's strictly medicinal. What's your disease? Guilt. What makes you guilty? My latest mischief, but I won't tell you. I don't know if I was born like this or I became like this, but when I was kicked out at 16 this fire grew inside me and never left. At sixteen? I wasn't going back, not under their rules. Some Italians were looking for models, they hired me and I took off. I quickly understood that in life, beauty means power. And I had it. Do I seem arrogant? Just sincere. I got hooked on that power. Seduction is addictive. It's a sophisticated hunt, the biggest of highs. I liked testing my limits. The harder, the better. When they fell in love, I dumped them. You're terrible. Not anymore. That I was able to cure. What aren't you cured of? Falling for the wrong person. I'll let you sleep. Good night. Good night. Let's go, Lola. ...95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100! Yolanda. Time goes by so fast. Don't cry sleeping bunny On the moon We are not always lucky When we fall in love The moon is so beautiful It's worth to be caught in its seas The night brightens your sorrows When it grows full - It's Liz. - Liz? Where are you? You'll have to shoot me up more often. It's hurting less now. When the day comes, you'll put me to sleep. Don't let me go to waste. Tell me you will. Tell me you will. Please. She drank too much. Margot, are you okay? Listen. We're going into town. You need something? - Wine. - Wine? Wine and Yolanda. My beautiful Yolanda. - She's drinking too much. - Coqui! Look! We all drank. Let her be. Margot, you'll get cirrhosis if you don't stop. Don't say that. That's serious. You are always hiding things from each other. Just like with Liz. What are you talking about? Nothing, let's go. - No, what's happening? - Ask Dolores. What is wrong with Liz? It's not fair. They are also her friends. Sell me a watermelon. How much? Five and a half. Six. She beat you again. High five! What did you do to make her so happy? I'm a good mechanic. And a cheater. She's pretty, huh? - How much? - No, I'm buying. Hey, Pedro. You can't let her pay. Sorry, it's for your birthday. In my world, the birthday girl doesn't pay. My shirt becomes you. Meet Any, Alex and Liz. Hi. How are you? Thanks. Your pay, sir. Let's go. Are you ready? Sure. Would you like to have another child? I'm not ready. But you can take care of another woman's child. What? Turn right on that trail. Please, do it. Did the kid get better? How long have you known? Forgive me, I don't know what happened, but since Tommy died, I... I'm glad you helped her. Turn off the car. WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE NUMBERS Say this time your world was shaken. Go after her. It's too late. There's something you're not telling me. - That I know of... - Please. We've been friends for 18 years, right? I hope it goes on for another 100 years. One hundred years. That's what worries me. What worries you? Posterity. Posterity? I bet one day your paintings will be in the best museums. Why bet? You always win. You and Alex have kids, who will have their own kids. Dolores has her books. Margot, her hotel. What do I leave behind? Love. Isn't it enough? How long does it last? An eternity. Oh, Liz. I finally won a bet! What bet? One I had with Alex. Go after her. - Take this. - Mine. Okay... Well, watch out. - Hi. - Hi. Where is Liz? Maybe in her room. She was tired. Thanks. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe Catch a tiger by the toe... Hey, who took one of mine? You think you locked it? Liz, let's go! Gentlemen, the National Guard has arrived. Shut up and let's go. Leave that bottle. Juan, she's mad. - What did she drink? - More than one bottle. Dolores. Close the door on your way out. Let's go. Are you taking advantage of me? What are you doing in my bed? I don't know yet. And my clothes? On the floor. What have you done to me? What you've done to many without thinking twice. That's not fair, I couldn't defend myself. Really? Defend yourself now. You're soft. Different? A lot. Better or worse? Different. Very different. Why did you come back? Because Changó drove me crazy. Do you think love can heal? More than marijuana for sure. How's that going? Look, a shark. Wow! It's a big one. Did you catch it yourself? Yes. Are you going to be a painter? No, a biker like you. Today is my birthday. Can I have it? - You know how old I'll be? - How old? Thirty-Seven. But that's too much! - Then, its mine? - Yes. So... When did you start believing? I want to be cured. Anything goes. Let's do this. Lie down and take your shirt off. Lie down girl! Don't cross your legs. Your potion stinks. No criticizing. Any dreams? I don't know if it's a dream or a nightmare. Everything is the same, but without me, they eat, drink, laugh... ...dance as always, but without me. They don't even notice I'm not there. All set. So? Ten more minutes? One minute can be a century, it all depends how you live it. On this day of your birthday I've come to congratulate you Also to offer you This bouquet of flowers Joyfully picked up From the garden of love Happy birthday! Here. For your posterity. It's beautiful. Let's see. Beautiful. Thanks. We made it together. For your nights of passion. She spent all week adding songs, but I bought the player. And since we give what we like... First the birthday girl. Congratulations, let's toast. With a warning. If you hurt her, I'll take her from you. - Cheers! - Cheers! It's my turn. Now the year resolutions. This year... ...I'll go diving in Bora Bora, if Eva comes with me. This year, it's over. The next one to walk through that door is mine. This year I'll learn English to go to Miami. Learn Spanish first, it will be more useful! I'll learn lyrical singing. This year, I'll come out of the closet. And I swear I'll beat you at something. A year's too long. Let's do it now. To the pool. No, Liz. The water's too cold. What's wrong with you? First time you back down on a bet. Liz, stop that. Don't be a downer. Dinner's ready, it'll get cold. I'm going. You're chicken. If you don't come you lose, and you owe me. Let's go. One way. Both ways. Go! I beat you. I let you because it's your birthday. You owe me. They had to go, it was urgent. Liz is not well. I know. Who told you? I know the disease. It took my son. I don't mind the pain, only the guilt. I want to rip it out like you do an arm, or a leg that's diseased and slowly killing you. I couldn't scream. I couldn't make a sound. Silent, like a fish in agonizing pain. I fought so hard. I made him suffer for nothing. Cancer. Sometimes the worst does happen. ...83, 84... Why me? Why now? You die and that's it. I don't remember the departed. Why would I be remembered? When I'm no longer around, you'll remember me like this, floating. So you know? See how bad I am? I didn't tell you. It's not that. You were scared. Scared. Go back to your husband. Is that an order? No, it's a favor. I hate being pitied, and sick people are always pitied. How am I looking at you? How will I know? Is it what you're feeling or what I need? You decide. Why do I love you so much? Is it because I'm dying? Probably. And me? No one can resist me. No one. Take this out. Please. What are you doing? I'm checking out. Are you crazy? Take your shoes off and get back in your bed. This is not my bed. I'm leaving. No, you're not. Will you stop me? Eva, give us a few minutes, please. No. If you have something to say, go ahead. You need surgery. I see. One operation now, another one later... Until there is not even a bone left. - There is a new chemo. - Really? That doesn't make you nauseous? Or makes your hair fall out? Or makes you crawl to the bathroom? No, thank you. I already went thru that. But treatment made you well, Liz. How much time do I have? I don't know. - Six months? - I don't know. Doctor Jahn doesn't know. Three? Two? One? Tell me! Two months, I don't know. Two months still self-sufficient? You have to get ready. We have to be ready. Liz, I can't do it. - You can't do what? - I can't. - You promised. - I'm not doing that. I can't do it by myself, Lola. I'll do it. If Dolores tells me how, I'll do it. Scientists say that in millions of years, the sun will die and nothing will stay alive on the planet. Millions of years, and we're gone in a second. I have something to tell you. It's mine, right? For sure. And if it's a girl I know what I'll call her. Don't do that to her. Teach her to dive, okay? Teach her to hold her breath till 100. And open her eyes underwater. What's this image I'll be taking with me? What should I tell Tommy? To take care of you. Thank you. Ten... Nine... ...eight... ...seven... ...six... ...five... Five... ...four... ...three... ...two... ...one. You ruined the game! You play worse than Margot. Didn't you say Liz taught you? And it's official. We win! Let me see your points. Mommy! Come here my baby boy! That looks delicious. Lizzy! Floating, floating...
