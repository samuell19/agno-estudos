THE METHOD In an hour's time, the IMF-World Bank summit will begin in Madrid. Tens of thousands of young people have arrived here, gathered by over 800 anti-globalization organizations. They will be demonstrating against some of the men who decide this planet's future. There might be trouble. What if I don't go to school? Then there will be trouble! Now, finish that! They have tried to break the police barricade... Have you seen what's happening? Shouldn't I take the car? - Oh, Sandra! - For God's sake! - Who did that? - He did. No, she did. - He did it. - No, it was her. As in Seattle, Prague and Geneva, it is feared there may be acts of violence prompted by the more radical anti-capitalist groups who accuse the IMF and the World Bank of being used by corporations in order to exploit child labor, sell manipulated food and destroy the planet's resources. Meanwhile, the IMF authorities... are forced to listen to protests by the demonstrators. But while the latter object to neo-liberal policies the former consider that free trade is vital for the 3rd World and only a free, globalized market can help weaker economies... No, not today, Roque. To achieve the impulse they need in order to grow. We'll shortly hear the outcome of this summit. IMF-WB SUMMIT BEGINS TODAY IN A BESIEGED MADRID Police controls, streets blocked to traffic and crowd control barriers are making the city a hell for its inhabitants. Access roads are jammed and tailbacks can be measured in kilometers. They want to demonstrate but they won't respect our right to work. They demonstrate against multinational corporations and run from our police in shoes made by those same corporations. I'm going right here, to the Dekia Tower. Thanks. AGAINST THE IMF-WB ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE Good morning. - The Personnel Department? - Your I.D., please. - Floor 35. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm here for the selection test. Very well. Here you are. Your letter. Name? It's right there. Carlos de Aristegui Santos. You have to fill out this form. You can do it inside. Excuse me. I've filled out this form already, or one very like it. Yes. Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. Hello, there. Hello. That seat is taken. Excuse me, taken by whom? By me. Nieves. Carlos. How are things? How are you? Fine. - And you? - Very well. It's been ages. Two years, nearly three. Did you apply too? Yes, what a coincidence. - Shall we fill out the form? - Yes, of course. We'll talk later. Excuse me. Would you mind sitting over there? - Of course not. - Thank you. Having your back to the door brings bad energy. Is this your first time here? I've had two interviews. Two? I've had three. Well, the first was really a psycho-technical test. Yes, I had that too. Have you all come before too? Anyone know what this Grönholm method is? Grönholm, right? Grönholm. Grönholm. Yes. Well, no, but I guess it's the selection method they use. I know that. It even says so here. "Grönholm personnel selection method". Do you know what it is? I guess it's the method of bringing the candidates together and making us interact to see who stands out. Group dynamics, it's called. It's like those clauses used by lawyers in multinational companies to cover their backs. Yes, to avoid lawsuits. - Good morning. - Hello. It's logical, isn't it? Today, you can be sued for almost anything. But why do they need to be so careful with us? I've filled this out already. Excuse me, I've already filled out a form like this. In fact, I've filled out two, one for each interview I've had. And my résumé gives almost the same details. I don't see why I should do it again. Everyone's doing it. Yes. And? And? I don't think I'm the only one here who thinks this is... I don't know. Slightly humiliating. - You know? - No one's forcing you to do it. - What? - It's not obligatory. Well... Only fill it out if you want to be assessed. Is there a reason for this? Maybe to try our patience? Because if that's so, I'll fill it out for a third time. I don't know why it bothers you so much. I don't know, but I think that with such an inflexible attitude it's... I'm saying it for your own good, it's not my problem. It's incredible. I have to keep filling out forms and yet I'm the inflexible... All right, all right. You've shown that you don't lower yourself. But let the rest of us do it if we want to! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, love. You're welcome. What's your name? Montse. Excuse me. I don't know if you noticed, but the form wasn't exactly like the others. For example, it included the Grönholm clause. What now, guys? - What do we have to do? - Wait, I guess. Will we be interviewed together? I was told so. A joint interview with the candidates. It's what I told you. Group dynamics. The candidates are given a series of theoretical cases, or problems that might come up in the job, and they have to discuss the best solution. So we have to wait for someone from the firm. A psychologist, probably. Is it necessary? Yes, because usually the dynamic of these tests is... - How come you're here? - I live in Madrid now. So I see. Since when? Almost 18 months now. And how come... How come you've never called me in all this time? Well, no one has said anything but if anyone from the firm comes they've got nowhere to sit. Maybe no one will come. - What? - Maybe not. Maybe no one will come. In the U.S. They have a kind of test for selecting personnel. They summon the candidates and lock them in a room. Lock them in? Yes, to see how they react, how they inter-relate, - if anyone is conflictive... - Who talks more, who talks less. How are they assessed if no one from the company is there? I bet there are microphones and they're listening. - And cameras. - Cameras? - Where? - I don't know, hidden. In the lampshades, anywhere. Is that legal? - As if that were a problem. - It could be. Maybe that's why we had to sign the Grönholm clause. If it's illegal to use cameras, signing clauses won't make it legal. I'm going to ask the secretary what we're waiting for. What is this? A joke? Are we locked in? What if I need to use the bathroom? Are they turning on? Yes, so it seems. Let's see what the machines have to say. Nothing, it seems. - I've got a note. - What does it say? - Haven't you got one? - No. Shall I read it? "Good morning, everyone. Dekia congratulates you on getting this far. You have passed the previous interviews and tests, amply demonstrating your experience and capacity to occupy the post. However, today it will be decided who is the most suitable. If at any moment you consider that any of the tests are unacceptable, you can abandon the process. No one is obliged to do anything but while you remain here you must accept the conditions set out in the Grönholm method." This Grönholm method is starting to worry me. Maybe we should ask what it is before we carry on. The fact is, if we're going to be shut in all day someone could at least show his face. It's another note. "The first test..." No, please. "The first test is the following. We've told you that you are the final candidates but not the seven final candidates. One of you is a member of our personnel selection department. Your first task is to find out which of you is not a real candidate." I thought it was only an interview. It's good. What's good? The test. It's really good. When we came in, we thought we were all equals, all candidates but we're not. I've read about this. They pretend to be candidates so they can observe us up close, listen to what we say. Well, let's do it. Let's find the mole. I think that if there is a mole, it's you. I'm sorry? Carlos. Carlos. I'm Ana. Why do you think it's me, Ana? Well, you seem to be very enthusiastic, trying to direct the test from the start. That's not bad. Well, I think it could be you. You do? Why? By accusing me you draw attention from yourself. - For example. - That's not bad. I think it could be either of you. I suggest that we all introduce ourselves and tell others where we currently work. A mole won't tell the truth. Right, that's the fun of it. So what do you think? Shall I start? All right. I'm Julio Quintana, I'm a lawyer and an economist. My last job was manager of Rocher's commercial subsidiary in Spain. Rocher? Yes, Rocher, it's a French corporation. It deals with pesticides. Before that, I set up the subsidiary in Portugal, now number one in the sector. Aren't you a bit over-qualified for this post? You think so? Shall I carry on? I'm Nieves Martin, I run the Special Products Department for a publishing company. Special Products? Collections for newspapers and magazines, packs, hybrids, and events too. Anything that helps to launch a book or collection. It seems interesting. Why are you leaving it? You are leaving it, aren't you? I want to try new things before it's too late for me. Well, I'll go next, if you want. I'm Carlos de Arístegui, I'm an economist. One question. Is "de" part of your surname or do you add it spontaneously? It's part of it. I studied economics at Cambridge and mastered in Communications at the University of Columbia. Where do you work? Right now, in the Communications and Marketing Department of an English cell phone company soon to be set up in Spain. What company? Whirkel. Can you two corroborate all of that? You know each other, don't you? - Yes. - No. Well, we haven't seen each other for nearly three years. You were working in Barcelona when we met, right? Yes. And you weren't in your present jobs then? No. Can each confirm that the other wasn't a psychologist then? Yes, of course. We only knew each other for a few days but he wasn't a psychologist. That's no use. They could both be lying. If one of them is the mole, he'll have lied. The other won't say anything, he has an advantage. We're saying what our jobs are. You can believe it or not. That doesn't matter. Let's continue and we'll be in equal conditions. I'm Ricardo Arcés and I won't say where I work. Why's that? I don't want my company to hear about this. - We're not going to tell them. - Everything gets out eventually. There seems to be a certain lack of collaboration in the group. Excuse me, what group? We're competing for the same job. Well, it's my turn. I'm Ana Páez, and I'm head of production at Minena studios. Basically, we record music and my idea of opening a studio in Ibiza has had fantastic results. We've had lots of people there, from Mike Oldfield to Bustamante. It's been less for the sound quality and more for a few days on the beach. Apart from that, the idea was very, very profitable for the company. I'm Fernando de Monagas. I do add the "de" spontaneously. And I too refuse to say where I work. Not out of caution, like our colleague Ricardo, but because I don't intend to make things easier for you. As clear as that. If someone is observing us, the first thing they'll assess is our capacity to get results. And here the result is to discover the mole. Is that clear? Crystal clear. I don't think they'll assess only the capacity to impose ourselves on others. What will they assess? Our capacity to work as a team, for example. Yes, we're supposed to discover the mole, not compete with each other. Sure, and they'll name all of us Head of Department, a team. I'm betting on the gentleman on my left. I'm betting that he's the mole, I mean. And I'm doing it before he introduces himself. - May I ask why? - Of course, obviously. You mentioned the hidden cameras, the American tests. It was you who said that maybe no one would come from the firm. And, quite honestly, it seems that for you this Big Brother-style lock-in - is wonderful. - That's got nothing to do with it. I just want to have a positive attitude. You've got it, believe me. May I ask how you know so much about these tests? Yes, of course. The fact is, a few years ago, I worked in Sonivision, an electronic components factory. Yes, Sonivision. It's on the Barcelona road, km. 65, area 4, lot 16. By the way, I'm Enrique León, and I'm now in a similar company, called Sonco. Did you work in human resources, personnel selection? No, no. I was financial director. But it was a small company, practically family-run, and someone had to do it. How do you know so much about these American methods? I got into the habit of keeping myself informed about selection techniques, group dynamics... - How do you do that? - Magazines, Internet... That's where you learned about selection, group dynamics, hidden cameras and so on. Yes, it is. I'm sorry, but I don't believe you either. I vote for you too. I vote for you too. - I don't think this is fair. - Don't take it personally. Sorry, it all points to you. What do you say? I think they're playing with us. Who? They told us there was a false candidate, but I think we're all real candidates and there's no imposter. I still think it's Enrique. As you wish. We have five votes for Enrique, one abstention. What about you, Enrique? Are you going to abstain or vote for someone? And what do you want to do now? Search me, or maybe lynch me? No, we'll just put your name in this box. Agreed? Fantastic. There's another note here. Do you have it? - Shall I read it? - Yes. Now you'll have to apologize. "To face the next test, you must first choose a group leader. The person cannot be chosen by majority vote. He or she must be chosen by consensus." - They don't say who the mole is? - No, that's all. They're not going to tell us? Because one of us here is not one of us. There is no mole. So one of us is going to be the team leader. How do we choose? We don't know each other, it'll have to be on pure intuition. Well, on pure intuition, I propose Enrique as leader. I refuse to pick the mole. You're really set on that! Why? If he were the mole he'd be the perfect choice. - No one would have an advantage. - What I really mean is that I'm not going to elect anyone except myself. - So, if we need a consensus... - All right. If you won't collaborate, fine, but please let us name a leader and then the company can decide. That's very good, Julio. And, in fact, I'm going to propose you. Not because he voted for me, but because I really see him as a good leader. I propose that we vote. - Written, so that it's secret. - Yes, it's just a first step to see what support Julio has, or Enrique. They're the only proposals. And Fernando. All right. Let's see. Julio. Julio. Fernando. Julio. Abstention. Enrique. And Carlos. We've seen through a few of us. Couldn't Julio have voted for me? Three votes for Julio, one abstention, one each for Carlos, Enrique and Fernando. - I support Julio too. - Four votes for Julio. Yes, me too, of course. Abstaining was very noble, Julio. Yes. No. - That wasn't me. - No? Five votes for Julio. Five votes for Julio. What do you want from me? Very well. Given the circumstances, I wish to announce that I have nobly ceded my vote to Julio. No, don't thank me. There's just one vote to clarify. Does anyone not support Julio? Well, it's clarified. Very well. Thank you for your trust, everyone. DAVID VERSUS GOLIAT Julio, isn't that you? Wasn't that a few years ago? Yes, May 2001. A chemical plant, right? Yes, a pesticide factory. You reported your company for causing pollution. I did what had to be done to avoid a disaster. - When was it? - May 2001, it says here. You were on all the news programs. We've got a national hero among us. Thank you, really. I would have preferred it hadn't gone that far. You're making it hard for the rest of us. What happened after you reported them? We managed to stop the pollution. A disaster was avoided. - Weren't there 200 lay-offs? - 200, yes. 200. We had to choose the lesser of two evils. I tried to sort it out from inside the company. I tried to convince the Board. It meant making some investments and that meant reducing profits for a few years. I have a question. Did you include this in your résumé or did the company discover it? I didn't include it. I don't hide it either, but the fact is I don't think it's part of my résumé. So, they've done their homework. There's a note. You don't have it? "Now decide what you would do with Julio Quintana's application if you were part of this company's Personnel Department. Your decision will determine whether or not he remains in the selection process." Well, I think we're starting to find out what the Grönholm method is. Will they have something like that for each of us? I think, as a starting point, that today, ecology and respect for the environment is a factor no decent company can disregard... If I may, Enrique. I think we have to tackle the problem head on. We have to decide if we trust Julio, right? Sorry about this. But you did betray the company you were working for. I didn't betray anyone. I warned them, I told you. I tried to talk to the Board. I'm not denying you did all you could, - but you did betray the company. - I didn't betray it. They left me no other choice if I didn't want to be part of a disaster in the River Duero. I don't want to pass judgment on what you did. - Well, you are. - No, I'm not. You are, from the moment you called it betrayal. We have to decide as if we were them, not judge Julio. I think the secret vote worked very well before. I won't accept you calling what I did a betrayal. I tried everything I could, they left me with no choice. It's important you didn't betray the company for your own benefit but for the common good. The river would never have recovered. Anyway, sooner or later, the plant would have closed and the company's image would have been worse. Just look at what the article says about him. I'm sorry to insist, but we're not discussing the morality of Julio's decision. We're discussing whether we'd give him the job if we had the responsibility for doing so. Really, the question is where should decisions be taken. - Looking at it that way... - No, not even then. What we have to discuss is the consequences of our decisions. If the company asked you, would you do something illegal? I would pick Julio, and I'll tell you why. In the end what matters for a company are the results of our decisions. In fact, the best companies are those which absorb the best ideas, wherever they come from. In the case of the chemical plant, or whatever Julio's company was, the problem laid within the Board of Management. It was their responsibility, quite clearly, for having accepted a suicidal risk in emptying waste into the river and for not foreseeing consequences such as Julio's denunciation. Exactly. In fact, a rival company didn't waste time in hiring you, right? All right, I don't have the data to judge this case. Maybe the rivals hired him to improve their own image, or he negotiated his departure before reporting the damage. I'm sorry, it's nothing personal. It doesn't matter what we do? Of course it matters. I don't agree with leaving moral judgments aside. It's inevitable to make them, and it's good to make them. I think that what Julio did was right, and the company was wrong. What's more, I'd have done the same if I'd had no other choice. None of us doubts that your aim, your intention, was correct. But our duty now is to decide if in these circumstances, today, we'd give you the job. And there is one detail that makes me think I wouldn't. Not that you put other interests before those of your company but that you were mistaken in how you did it. If you were so obviously right, and the Board was so wrong on both a moral and business level, how could you not make them see it? It probably was a company error too. Sure. But it's Julio that we're judging here. My conclusion, therefore, is that you were unable to establish a correct, efficient communication with the Board. That's why I wouldn't give you the job. - Shall we vote? - Yes. I have to say that, after the debate, which I thought was very interesting, I wouldn't accept Julio's application to join this company. Sorry. If I were the company I might not want to employ Julio, but I'm not sure I want to vote. That's very clever of you. Voting means accepting responsibility for expelling Julio. That's what they call it, expulsion. The company has given us that responsibility without consulting us, and free of charge. And you've accepted it without a word and assumed that it's what the company expects of you. But if it isn't so? Are you sure it's what the company wants from you? So we've got three, three and one abstention. Technically, it's a draw The company can decide, right? Ana? I did what I could. Julio... Your jacket. Fucking Grönholm method. What's up? What's up? Drop the screen bullshit. Come and tell me to my face. It must have been a mistake. I'm sorry, but I've been told the selection test is over. The team of psychologists has decided to reject your applications to join this company. I'm joking! We have a little problem with the computer connections. I'll fix right away. - Were you joking with Julio too? - No, that wasn't an error. Excuse me. - Am I in your way? - No, go right ahead. Let's see. They should turn on now. That's it. Well? How about a break to go to the bathroom? Are there cameras here too? Can you draw conclusions from how someone pisses? Nuts, isn't it? - What? - Everything. It's very well thought out, you must admit. And you learn a lot. The debate, for example. At first, I thought one thing and that girl, Nieves, made me change my mind. The system is very good. Yes, very good. What do you think? Maybe you're the infiltrator, with all your questions. What about the business with Julio? One less candidate, right? You think so? The only thing I'm wondering is if they really have a secret about each one of us to use when they feel it's necessary. Coffee? Thank you. Congratulations. Why? Your defense of Julio. You made it very tough. If it was so good, why did you vote against it? Well, I like to be begged. Look at them. The new school. I don't think there's a new school. You don't? Do you see any difference? No, none. Nothing very romantic. I was offered a better job than I had in Barcelona, and I came. Well... Do you like being in Madrid? I haven't had time to find out I haven't stopped working. Yes, because you came just after we met. - When was the Tunis Conference? - Easter, 2003. - We had a good time. - A very good time. It's a pity we met here, isn't it? Why? Because now I have to beat you. On the contrary. That makes it even more exciting. "The year 2013. World War III has broken out and the planet is suffocating beneath a radioactive cloud. Fortunately, you are all safe as you had time to get to an atomic shelter equipped with everything necessary to survive for 20 years. Unfortunately, the shelter was designed for a family of five people so one of you will have to leave. Decide who should do it, but first each one must defend his right to stay, using demonstrable arguments. Whoever is expelled from the shelter will also abandon the selection process." These are our résumés. - Must we stick to our résumés? - No, not as such. It's so we can check what each one says. I guess. Some things that aren't in a résumé can be useful in a shelter. Such as what? Cooking, for example. It's what I was going to say. I'm a great cook, I can do wonders. The thing is, it says here "demonstrable arguments". I don't know if what you say is true. Why don't you start? You've got it all clear. Very well. As you know, I've worked and am still working for electronic components companies. If you look at my résumé you'll see I've done courses in electronics and electricity. So I'd be able to build a radio. If there are survivors outside or life comes back. Build it? Weren't you the financial director? Yes, but the courses I did went into great detail. Look at my résumé. Yes, I've looked at it. Sufficient detail so you can build a radio? That's what I'm saying. Ask me about it, if you want. Won't the shelter have a radio? - Why? Who says so? - Nobody. I'm presuming. If it doesn't say so you can't presume anything. And there'll be electrical maintenance to be done too. I think good cooking is more important. Well... Has anyone done military service? Then I could take charge of organization and rationing. You'll forget the meaning of the word "mutiny". Yes, sir, on the double. Two days arrest outside the shelter, without a gas mask. - Do I have to do pushups? - Yes, later. In front of me. Why do we need someone in charge of organization and rationing? Excuse me? Because it's always needed. - Who says so? - You, for example, when we were talking about Julio. I was talking about running a company not living in a shelter. What's more, we're all adults and there's a thing called dialogue. Of course, but we're not arguing about playing cards or checkers. 20 years in an atomic shelter isn't a vacation, Nieves. We can take turns to organize the rationing. Great, great. Nieves, imagine it was your turn, for example, and I decide I want double rations because I feel like it, I woke up with an appetite. If we start like that... I won't do anything on my own, if that's your question. - But between us, we can stop you. - I'm talking about you, not them. Are you going to persuade them to act together? Are you going to make them all turn on me? Are you the mole trying to provoke things? You wish. I'm talking to her, not you. Yes. I'll do all that. What's more, I'll try to get you left outside the shelter. You're dangerous. How much more dangerous am I than Carlos or Enrique? Just enough, don't get big ideas. But I'm funnier too, aren't I? - Hilarious. - Of course! Tell me this. - You trust them more than me? - Of course. I could accept that authority is needed, but I'd never be alongside a military officer. You know the military service is just an excuse. You'd vote for me because you'd be safer under my authority. If you behave, that is. What are you saying? I'm saying that you, as a woman among so many men, prefer that there's authority so you feel more protected. Fernando, sweetheart, where have you escaped from? Fernando, you're a trained lawyer. Why didn't you say so? That would guarantee you a place in the shelter. What use is a lawyer in a world devastated by nuclear radiation? - If he were a physicist... - The law is always needed, even after the bomb. You can't deny that. - What use is law without authority? - Shit, John Wayne. All I'm saying is that if anyone eats a double ration I'll beat the crap out of him, and if anyone doesn't clean up, he'll get the same treatment. I give my word on that. What if you don't comply? Who'll control you? You. How sweet. To settle the question, shall we leave Fernando with the role of judge, and executioner if necessary. What do you propose? Me? In case the judge gets carried away, I offer my services as doctor. As my résumé states, I studied two and half years of Medicine so I know quite a bit. Not bad. That was a clever move, Ricardo. And after all that fuss about not saying where you worked, we can read it here at our ease. Joint Manager of the Transport Department of Mercolex. Did you go to class? When you were a student. Did you go to class? Yes, I did. Why? No reason. You've taken away my argument. I was going to offer myself as doctor. You studied medicine too? No, but... I go mountain climbing and I've done some first aid courses, anatomy... Come on, that's pushing it a bit, isn't it? No, why? I've done first aid courses too and I don't call myself a doctor. Yes, you're right. I was playing for time. I can't find... I can't find anything else of use in my résumé. Well, yes. I've got something. I'll tell you a story every night. It might sound a bit odd, but I studied literature for a few years and I read a lot. I can make your life underground much more bearable. Really, Carlos, it was a very good attempt. But, if you'll forgive me, right now I think that you and Ana are the worst qualified. Because you say so? There's a doctor, there's a judge, - a technician. - And a cook. Yes. Don't you like how she cooks? It's not that, Fernando. It's not included in her résumé. And what use is a radio if the planet is destroyed? Well, I was just giving my opinion. Nieves, you're last. All right. I offer to be the mother of all your children. Irrefutable! The mother of post-atomic humanity. All right, I hadn't thought about that. I can fulfill that role too. That just leaves you, Carlos. Excuse me, Ana. I don't want to be rude, but aren't you a bit old? No. Are you sure? Very sure. - I'm not twenty, I know, but... - Nor thirty. I still have a few fertile years. And I have a child, which guarantees I can have them. I'm sorry to insist. For how long will you be able to be a mother still? Aren't you at a dangerous age already? The risk is still acceptable. Or do you only like adolescents? Well, I don't think this is getting us anywhere. No, it's very good. They have to argue to see who wins. I think that between a good meal and telling a story... What? It's obvious! Have you read Jack London? - What? - Jack London. He has a story about some Eskimos who migrate when the seasons change. There's a man who's old, weary, almost blind. He feels he can't keep up with the tribe. So the whole group stops and they say goodbye to him, one by one, his children too. They leave him there, just like that, with a little pile of firewood. The old man sits in the snow, calmly, remembering his life, and when the wood runs out he freezes to death. Is that one of the stories you'd tell us? Why not? It's very educational. A lot of people could learn from it. Who do you think you are? Will you be more useful with your stories? Why do you dare call me old? You little ass-licker. They can screw me. Will you offer them your ass? It would be best if you all chose and kept us from insulting each other. She's right. I think we should vote. Who wants me to stay in the shelter? I'm voting for the cook. Nieves? I'll do the same as before, if you don't mind. I'm abstaining. Do I put Ana's name in the box? Before you throw me out, I want to ask a question. Is it because I'm a woman? Because I'm over forty? Or both things? We're not throwing you out. Then don't vote. Do like Ricardo. Abstain, let the company decide. Like you did with Julio? They're not throwing you out for the reasons you're saying. It's because you couldn't defend your presence in the shelter. So I think. What's going on down there? You can't see anything here. I'm sorry, Ana. I did the same as you, defend myself. I don't believe what I said. I was playing a role to win the game. Honestly. Over there, please. Won't you stay for lunch? There's enough for everyone. Is this all there is to drink? Yes, alcoholic drinks aren't allowed in this company. I apologize for offering you a cold lunch, but the demonstration is causing problems with the restaurants. It's fine, don't worry. Is it my imagination or does this smell bad? You don't mind if I eat with you, do you? No, not at all. Thank you. How are you getting on? Great, it's fantastic. The method, I mean. You think so? Yes. Forget the Americans. In my humble opinion, I think it's very good. A deadly silence. Don't you like the food? No, I'm not very hungry. - Is the food bad? - No, a bit cold, but it's not bad. The smell is a bit... It's very good. You didn't like it either. I don't know, maybe we had a bad taste in our mouths already. Well... No, thank you. Why didn't you call back? I left you several messages. Remember the night on the beach? If we'd done all we said, we'd be living in Africa now. Yes. - On the seashore. - In a cabin. An arm's reach from the water. Wonderful. Running a bar on the beach. To make ends meet. Because we'd have to feed all our children. That's right. Lots of African children. A whole soccer team. It was nice dreaming with you. Likewise. Why didn't you call? Did you have a boyfriend, a husband? I don't mind, the past is the past. It's just to see if I have a chance. Did you have those children without me? I had one, who looked a lot like you. A little African boy, handsome like you. Excuse me. What are you doing! Forgive me, I'm really sorry. I don't know how it happened. - You don't know? - No. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. It'll wash out. I won't be long. May I? Yes, of course. Thank you. Are you all right? Absolutely fine. Forgive me, but if I may say so, you seem a bit strange. A bit strange? When? All the time. Since you arrived. I'd advise you to be more participative, more positive. I don't know. It irritates me how they poke around in our résumés, Why? Look at Julio. Don't you think he deserved a second chance? Yes. Well, I don't know. You are what you've done but also what you propose to do. Maybe you have something to hide. Maybe you're the mole. Something silly. It's not important, but I forgot to put it on the first form I had to fill in and then I didn't put it on the later ones. So I had to keep hiding it. Like I said, it's silly. I'd almost forgotten it. But given the way they are, they'd presume I was lying and they wouldn't forgive me. That's why I'm pissed off by all the damn forms. Yes, it makes sense to get us to fill them out so often. I just realized that. And what is that lie... that secret? It doesn't matter. Secret or lie, call it what you want. A few years ago, when I was living in Argentina, I worked for a state company while I was a student. Then it was privatized and the new management carried out what they called "structural readjustments". A covert way of firing people because it had agreed not to dismiss anyone. There was union action to prevent half the staff from being fired. I supported the action, of course, I was part of the staff. Anyway, I ended up being something like the employees' spokesman. A union delegate. An executive with a union background? If these guys ask for references from those guys... Hello. How are things? I've been wanting to talk to you alone all day and this is the best moment. Well... I don't want to. Don't want to what? Talk? To do anything alone with you. Do you think there are cameras in here? I don't. - It'd be too much, wouldn't it? - Why do you ask? It's the only place here where we can be ourselves. Where we can take off our disguises. You mean our clothes? That too. We'd understand each other much better. I'm sorry, Fernando. No luck. The "Iberian macho" doesn't turn me on. What a pity. Do you say that every day in the mirror? Do you always look like that when you say it? To your regret, yes. Only some situations turn you on, right? And only bastards like me know what those are. If you don't mind, I have to wash. I don't mind at all. Go ahead. You said I could trust you. - Didn't you? - Yes. I still say it. Then hang up my blouse and leave. What are you doing? What are you doing? Finish it off on your own. Bitch. Nieves! You know the march was a success? It's bigger than the anti-war protest. A pity we can't see the street. Did you join the protest or did you ask for a day off to come here? In your company, I mean. Wearing a 1,000 euro suit and protesting against the World Bank? Why not? If you stop to think about it, you never know. Today you're here, you feel part of Dekia. And tomorrow... Some of what they're saying is true. The IMF people are destroying the world. If I hadn't been screwed in Argentina, you think I'd be here now? There are things that a million marches can't change. Are you sure? You think nothing can be done? Maybe you're right. But you'll agree that this world is crap right now. I wish I could say otherwise. The people marching down there... I envy their conviction. Don't you? If you really believed that marching could change things, wouldn't you do it? Well, if I believed... That's what I mean. I envy their conviction. You're sitting on the fence! You don't go and protest but you ask for the day off. No, don't distort things! I asked for the day off to come here. And you keep everyone happy. The employees think you're a liberal and the bosses think you're a sensible man who doesn't want his car burned! You want to make me look like an opportunist and it isn't so. I understand the reasons for the march as well as you do, and I'll defend them if necessary. But certain categories of employees can't go joining every parade. Where is that written? I don't know if it's written, but that's how it is. An executive can't just walk out and join a protest, as if he had no responsibilities. Why not? Because it would be hypocritical. This protest is against how the world is being managed. If, as you said, you understand the reasons for it, why not support it? Whether you're a laborer or a bank manager. If you're a bank manager, you pick up the phone, you call the president of the government and tell him what you think of it all. Let's see. Do we agree that whether you're a student, an executive, a businessman or a simple worker, you can think what you want of the IMF and the World Bank? If you don't care what's at stake, you can look away. - But in this case... - It is important. All right. Thank you. Talking about the protest? If you knew what was going on around here. All the companies have closed for the afternoon. - Really? - Yes, of course. Right now, you can't even walk on the street. - That's why the food was cold. - So you said. Well... What were you saying about the protest? - You don't mind me asking? - No, of course not. Nothing. Who can be against it? So you agree with it? Someone in our position can't agree with a protest. Enrique, it's one thing not to march, but you admitted that you agreed with the reasons. What I mean is I understand the reasons but I don't agree. I can't support a protest. - What? You told me you did. - No, don't twist things around. - You just told me so. - Don't include me with you! I'm not in any union! What I mean is... I didn't mean that... - What I mean... - You're incredible. What is this, Ricardo? Let's not get upset. I didn't mean to say that. What was it? What was it that you didn't mean to say? Nothing. Excuse me, he told you it wasn't important. Are you telling me what I can ask? Is this part of the test or what? He said it wasn't important and I simply don't see why you have to go on about it. Forget it, Ricardo. You needn't go on about it. She's the one asking questions. Anyway, you were the one who went and gave me away. Just a minute. Enrique, is there something the company should know? Maybe you should ask him. Why? I'm... Well... I'm sorry, I don't mean to tell you what you should ask anyone, I would never dare, but... Do you know something? Do you or don't you? Excuse me, I'm not willing to go through this. And neither should you. - Don't you see it's humiliating? - It's not humiliating. Don't exaggerate. This guy is too much! Why not give him your shoe to lick? Excuse me, I think I told you this at the start. No one is forcing you to stay here. But while you're in this room the company lays down the rules. Do you see what's happening? If you don't mind, I'd rather... Don't you see they're asking you to give me away? Let's not get dramatic. That's what they're asking. She wants to know our opinion. No, she wants you to tell her about me. Let's just calm down. And what you know about me is what I told you. Because I trusted you. Come on, come on. Please, let's not get this out of proportion. It was just an oversight on a form. An oversight on a form I don't want them to known about. I think you're going overboard. Have you nothing to say? Are you just going to let this happen? Don't involve me. It's your business. I'm very sorry that things have gone this far. Yes, of course. But, Enrique, you know something the company doesn't know and should know, and you won't say what it is. I don't know. Your idea of company loyalty is a bit strange. This is unbelievable. Look, you're going to have to leave now anyway, aren't you? What does it matter if I tell her? I won't give you the pleasure of seeing me leave. So if you're going to tell on me... Look at me. Look at me. If you're going to do it, do it in front of me. It was nothing. Just that Ricardo, in Argentina, worked for a state company. When it was privatized, he became a union leader. And he completely screwed the new management, which was probably Spanish. That kind of people... And then they talk about stereotypes. Argentineans... You can't generalize. - Thank you, Montse. - Not at all. You were fantastic, really fantastic. Well... Well? How are you? Fine. And you? I'm fine, thank you. Well, now you know. I'm the mole. Nieves... Come on, we have to continue. What do you think of the method now? Good, isn't it? Of course it is. Of course it is. So, tell me. Yes. What do you think? About what you did. - What I did? - Yes. You think it was correct? What do you all think? How would you qualify what he did? Have you got anything to say? Yes. Yes, that... Of course. That... Well, that I agree. I completely agree that... I don't know what happened. I let myself be carried away by the moment, I guess. I thought that the secretary, Montse... I thought that she... It's so silly, isn't it? I want to apologize, to all of you, for what I made you go through. I still don't know what you think about what you did. About what? Telling the company what you knew about me. Should you have done it or not? Yes, yes. No. I mean, I think I shouldn't have done it. - Yes or no? - Yes or no, what? Yes or no, should you have done it? No. Yes. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I... I don't... I can't know. Do me a favor. Apply again when you've clarified your ideas. We'll be delighted to assess you again. At present, you're of no use. Good afternoon. Well, with a bit of luck, we'll be going home soon. On to the next test? Let's see. - Which shall it be? - Ricardo, just one question. Are there cameras or not? Of course not. Not because it's illegal. We think it's unethical. We don't do things like that. Most companies don't just have cameras, they record the interviews too. But, no. We wouldn't dream of it. We're enjoying ourselves today. Don't you agree? About what? That this is fun. I wouldn't say it was fun exactly. What would you say? Exciting? Intense. That's not bad. Intense. Because of Enrique? For example. I'd say Enrique was the one who enjoyed it most. He was sitting there all day, really into it, focused. Enrique didn't do badly. He participated more than anyone. - Coffee? - No, thanks. I'd like some. Yes, of course. Enrique is undoubtedly pretty upset right now, and may be for a few more days. But, in the long term, don't you think all this will be of use to him? As Enrique himself would say, "Looking at it that way..." Thank you. Now, seriously, some candidates thank me. Even if they're eliminated. They say they feel more prepared for the daily struggle, more aware of their possibilities and their limitations. Did you know that the army invented selection tests? After World War I, in Germany. The Treaty of Versailles had greatly restricted the German army, so they decided to submit officers to tests like these. And to assess them better, they always used a psychologist too. It was adopted by the English army, then by the American army, and then by companies. You should learn something new every day. A difficult decision. Choosing one of you, I mean. You're all really good, honestly. It's a pity only one can be left. Montse, may I have the ball, please? Remember the jokes about an Englishman a Frenchman and a Spaniard? Serrano ham. - Crepes. - Pudding. Potato omelet. Tartare. Whiskey. - Absinthe. - Sarsaparilla. Time. English drinks are lousy! Carry on, Fernando. Soccer players. Raúl. Rooney. - Zidane. - Very good. - Valeron. - Owen. Mendieta. Zizou. - He's the same. - Yeah, but he's French. But he's the same person. Let's skip soccer too. Fernando starts with Contributions to Humanity. What? Serrano ham. Guillotine. The Inquisition. - Shakespeare. - Quijote. Republic. Can't you throw it to each other? Iberian macho. Contributions to humanity aren't necessarily good. Let's continue. Carlos. The Beatles. Chupa-chups. Sex, but with people. Another one who believes the French invented sex? No, but what a difference from other countries. Carry on, Fernando. You have to deliver in time. Fernando, to Carlos. Financial advantages. Yeah. The pound doesn't depend on other European economies. The euro is growing stronger. Wait. Most of us speak French and English. You English can't say the same thing. Debatable. But we'll continue. We don't speak languages because we know we're great. - That's an advantage in business. - Not in this case. We speak Spanish, the second language in the world. The second is English. - The first, then. Even better. - The first is Mandarin Chinese. Screw the Chinese. Carlos, please. We have a close relationship with the U.S.A. Big deal, we've got the South American market. We too have a close relationship with the U.S.A. We're all they can never be. That's not a financial advantage. Debatable, but we'll continue. Do languages count now? While you're talking advantages. Are you only realizing now? - Fernando's turn. - But... Oh, yeah. Spain is the European economy with the best forecast. The fact is, France is the world's fourth economic power. Spain is an economic power too. You're supposed to cite advantages over the other two. Go ahead, Carlos. We have the most temporary jobs and short-term contracts. Very good for the businessman. We have the highest GNP and revenue of the three countries. Spain is the fastest growing European economy. Time. To Fernando. Shit. I forget to say an advantage. We don't have a fiscal deficit at present. We don't sell things we don't have. What did you say? Time, Fernando. To Nieves. What did you say? Watch your step, kid. Take it easy, they're just puns. Fernando. Fernando. - Throw it to Nieves. - Yes, sorry. I'm sorry. France has a great market in Arab countries. Spain is Europe's biggest tourist destination. We're talking about financial advantages, Fernando. What's so funny? Sorry, it was a stupid pun. Didn't you understand it? Nieves, time. To Fernando. No, I didn't. Will you translate it? Time's passing. It's my time. Will you translate it? He said you wanted to be a stockbroker and you ended up being... A stocktaker. Very good. Time. Carlos gets the ball. I didn't understand. Can you explain it? He's calling you a wanker. One more step and I'll tear your fucking head off. Kiddo! Congratulations, you've won. You're the best. Fucking great! You're the most qualified. You probably are. You know why? You believe it. All that shit about responsible companies and Japanese décor. All that fucking shit about democratic companies and sustainable development. That's all it is, believe me. They tell you you're the best, you believe it. The most intelligent, you believe it. The best intentioned, you believe it. The most tolerant, the most modern, even the most human, for crissake, and you believe it! Know what you are? This preppy doesn't care. Preppies look the other way, they learn that from birth. So it's easy for him. Forget about him. But what'll become of you when you stop believing? Or when you regret not having had that child, and it's too late? Because it's getting late. Or when it's the "Iberian macho" who wants nothing to do with you? How long will that smile last before it becomes a grimace? There's one difference between you and me. Just one. I learned long ago that you lose the battle on your own. On your own. How are you? I can't believe you're the psychologist. I thought you knew. It occurred to me, but you're a very good actor. You don't know how good. Because I am a candidate. I was doing so badly that during the break I arranged with Montse to set a trap for Enrique so I'd gain a few points. And they accepted it. What a bastard. You really are good. Are you all right? Would you like an aspirin? We always have it twice as hard, don't we? Women, I mean. Yes, we do. But you've been incredible. All day, in all the tests. Really. You were always my favorite. It's what you see. There are no psychologists. It's just her and me. We set it up, we assess it. That's the method. Your imagination projects the rest. Incredible. So Montse is a psychologist too? Where does the Grönholm method come from? Nowhere. But it sounds good, doesn't it? Actors. What do you mean? Yes, well, at times we even swap roles. I play the psychologist, he plays the secretary. They only have to decide who leaves and what tests to apply. They? The team of psychologists. What a question! You think we do this on our own? It all depends on who's left. The test with the ball was for Fernando. Why? We knew he didn't speak languages. I don't understand. You were out to get him? No, but let's say it was his test. Languages aren't a requirement but we wanted to see how he'd handle being at a disadvantage. We knew you two would take advantage of his weakness. Don't worry about Fernando. He was a dickhead. And he was out already. How do you mean? Really, they were all out. Except for you and Carlos. They'd all been ruled out. You already knew that they weren't? Of course. But the psychologists needed more candidates in order to assess you two. She's getting the job, Carlos. That's how it is. Right now, we should be saying to you, "Goodbye, thank you for coming, we'll be in touch", and so on. Not just because Montse has decided. Psychologists or not, women always stick together. But Nieves did better in the tests. That's the truth. You're not telling me all this just to throw me out, are you? I've made a deal with Montse. We're giving you a last chance. Most of the team still prefer him. I think he's been scoring better up to now. And, to be honest, they're a bit chauvinist, too. But, anyway, in theory there's one last test and they're giving you a chance. You can still get the job. There's one more test? Let's say there is another test. But Carlos doesn't know. Break her down? Look, this is exceptional. I insisted. If you don't manage it, the job's hers. How can I break her down? However you think. Carlos, I had to fight for this. Don't let me down. You've got 15 minutes. Ricardo is going to be as if he'd been held up. What you have to do, while you pretend to be waiting with Carlos, is get him to leave. Nieves, the job can still be yours. But you must persuade him to give up. Persuade him? Yes, tell him anything, like, his mother is in hospital. Come on, Nieves. And remember. 15 minutes. Anything goes. I had to shit, from nerves. How are you? Fine. Sure? If I can help you at all, if you need to talk... Fernando is a bastard. He was so violent. I was scared. You really think he was a bastard? Nieves, he nearly smashed your face with the ball. And then he went on about the children you haven't had, about how lonely you are. Maybe he saw that was your vulnerable side. Let's skip it. - You know this is his shirt? - Yes, I'd realized. It was so strange. I'd washed the stain out of mine and before I knew he'd stolen it. You met him in the bathroom? Did you know... Yes. What did he say? "Excuse me, I'm going inside to jack off"? No, I bet he said, "Babe, I'll give you the child you always wanted". - Did he force you? - I don't want to talk about it. Of course not. I just wanted to help, I guess. If you need to talk... - It's not necessary. - Right. I understand. Ricardo's taking his time. Carlos! Nothing. I'm so glad I found you. Even if it was here. One of us has to lose now. Even if it's me, I don't care. I won't let you get away. I've thought a lot about you. Why did you think about me? Don't read more into what I say than is really there. I didn't idealize what happened but I didn't forget it. In all this time, I've lived my life as usual, but... That night, we made all those plans. We knew we were playing but they could be true. You understand? And in these three years, it's not that I was missing that life we invented, but I haven't built anything. What you said about a little African boy, was it true? You'd have had a child with me? Let's go. Let's go now. Forget the test. - Now? - Yes, now. We've clearly shown what we're worth. If they want to choose, let them. Are you sure? How much more can they assess? How far do we have to compete? Until we tear each other's eyes out? I know there are lots of applicants and just one job. I understand we have to compete. I'm even willing to accept that life is like that. If I have to be a wolf, I'll be one. I didn't care with the others. But with you I don't want to. I don't. I want to go to the beach and get drunk and dream that we'll open that bar. - You're going to persuade me. - That's what I want. Let's go. Mademoiselle... Merci. Wait. Shall we go? What part of you do I have to believe now? This one, Carlos. Of course! Of course! Of course! Why didn't I realize? They gave you an objective too, didn't they? It doesn't matter. I didn't reach it. So we don't know what would have happened. Everything you said... Was that why? When you asked about the African baby, did you want to know if I'd have had a child with you, or was it to pass the test? It's not too late. You can still get the job. Do I have to do something for you to get it? What do I have to do?
