(Mother and Son) Whatever Mum said she made it sound important. At the same time she'd have a far away look. It was hard to know what she felt. I mean, what she really felt. The night we arrived in France she was constantly in motion probably to stop herself collapsing. Perhaps it was because I was the youngest that I clung to her shining light rather than the rest. Her suitcase, full of the sorrows she'd brought from back home was her secret. Mummy? Why don't we put the suitcase outside the door? Because if we do that it'll be in Eugénie and Félicien's way. So we'll put it here. Let's put it on the balcony. No, it's staying here. Lie down. Give me that. Why isn't Ernest going to sleep? Dear God… Lie down. I want to sleep next to him. Get under the covers. - No! You're going to sleep. Why? Jean, what's the matter? - Nothing! Thank you. Were the children frightened in the plane? The noise scared them a bit when the plane took off and they had ear ache during the flight due to the altitude, but they're OK. That's the air pressure. It'll go away. So, our flat's not very big but we're going to organise it so everyone's comfortable. The room we put you in is temporary. - I know. We'll find a proper solution after won't we, love? Yes. You're in France now. We're here to help. We're family. Thank you. Thank you very much. Air Gabon. Air Gabon, Air France. Where's Air Côte d'Ivoire? That's really good, Jean. He wants to be a pilot. My son drew those. - All of them? And he's 10! What's your name? Julius Caesar. You're called Julius Caesar? - Yes. There you go. Do you want some? - Yes please. Is school going well? - Very well. For both of them? What's your average mark? At school? His average is A. - A? Is your throat still sore, Ernest? Take your medicine. You don't want it? - No. Later then. You should take the medicine. It'll do you good. You'll feel better. You try then. He won't take it from me. Your throat's sore? Look, just take a little. Open wide, say "Ah". Does it taste good? No, it doesn't, but thanks very much, Julius Caesar. You're welcome. Were you going to use your felt-tip pen as a straw? He wants to drive planes. - Drive planes? And what do you want to do later on? You don't know? You know, it's good to be with someone who likes your children. Not someone that you like. That's important. Yeah OK, Eugénie. Huh? Rose? Yes, Eugénie! This is embarrassing. Right, then. You know, on our own we lose our footing. That would be a shame for beautiful feet like yours. I'm not on my own. You need someone for you and for the children. Someone to look after you. You talk too much. I know. But my shop's doing well. It's open every day. We'll go out to eat together. Take the children out. You shouldn't be on you own. "My love," "Let us see if the rose" "That in the morning light opened" "Her crimson robe to the sun" "This evening has lost once more, the folds of her crimson tussore." "Alas!" I need to swot up! "See how in such short space…" See you, Julius Caesar. Bye, see you soon. - Yes, see you. Rose, stop drinking and go to bed. I'm practicing for tomorrow. You think work's easy here, eh? So what about Félicien? What's new? - What's it to you? Why don't you go and see him? How did it go with Julius Caesar? Julius Caesar. It's going OK. He's a nice man, you know. He's a nice man. He's nice. I choose my men myself. Those kind of guys… who say "you belong to me". I don't belong to anyone. Ready? One, two, three… Go! Hello. - Hello. Shall we go into my office? I'd like to sit in his seat. Ah, that's just behind. Don't move, I'll sit next to you. It'll make a nice change. Let me say how happy I am to meet you. If Ernest is a problem you must tell me. I can assure you Ernest isn't a problem but it's important that he works with a speech therapist. What is that? Someone to help him with reading and writing. And congratulations to Jean on passing the 1st maths entrance exam. Wish him luck from me for the 2nd part. You know it's rare to be noticed so young. Yes. I'm the most powerful. No, I am. I'm the other dinosaur then. I'm going to get him. I'm changing into a car. Get back to where you came from blue robot. I've got an idea. Let's hide behind that. I can't do it. Look. Give me your hand. Put that down. Put your robot down. Put your finger here, like this. Now, lift up your hand. But it's going to fall. - No it won't. See? Lift your hand up. Lift it up. - Mum? Now balance it. Mum, when will they come? When will who come? My brothers. Well… They're not coming yet. When are they going to come? Your brothers can't come for the moment. That's how it is. It's not my fault. You can't do anything. That's exactly how it is. I can't do anything. Why? Why aren't they here, Mum? Because that's how it is. Are they at our house? - They're back home. If you want your brothers to be very, very proud of you, you have to be champions. True champions who work hard at school and are 1st in class. So, work very hard at school! We do work hard at school. You have to work even harder. And we don't cry. We don't cry in front of anyone. If you need to cry go away and hide. But we don't cry. We cry inside. - Exactly. Listen to your brother. We cry in our heads. OK? Good. Yeah. Oh, yeah! This bath is so good! Isn't it? Mum? Why are you putting on earrings? Because I'm going out, Mr Jean. Where are you going? I'm going out, not very far. On your own or with someone? Is that your business? - No. Right. Thank you. Are you going on your own or with someone? You're staying here with Eugénie. Can I come with you? I'm going out to eat with a man. Is the man married? I don't know. How old is he? I don't know. How tall is he? Is he tall or short? He's my height. Has he got any pets? How would I know? I don't know. If you don't know, you say nothing. Has he got any children? I'll be back later. And when I come back what am I going to do? I don't know. When I come back I'm going… to… eat you. Thanks so much. Come and dance! No thanks. What about their dad? The first one died years ago. He was old. With the second, we don't speak. Thank goodness. How about you? I'm on my own here in Paris. I've got family in Marseille. My parents and my sister are back home in Bizerte. What's Bizerte? It's in Tunisia. Bye, Naïma. - See you soon. Good morning. Everything OK? Were the children good? Rose? Did you buy this? - Yes. I brought that back the other day. Have some, they're for everyone. Naïma too. "The Mayor of Paris and Jacques Chirac have pleasure in" "offering you these chocolates for Xmas." "Wishing you a Happy New Year." Goodness me! He's a bit late. It's March. That guy's really good. He's everywhere. Looking after everyone. You think Mr Chirac put these notes in the boxes himself? Of course! Why not? He's Father Xmas. Rose, did you steal them? Rose? I don't want problems at work. If I hadn't taken them they'd have gone in the bin, huh? But in that case, maybe you shouldn't eat chocolate. The French take themselves so seriously. Did you call Julius Caesar? No! I haven't called Julius Caesar. You don't know where she was last night. Boys, we're going shopping! Boys, we've got chocolate. Jean, Ernest. Coats on! Have some if you want. And give your mum a kiss. Bye. - Bye little man. Ernest, wait for me. No running. Félicien, can I come with you? I'm going to work. - But can I come? It's not allowed, Jean. I want to watch you driving. Not today. Maybe another day. What are you driving today? – The RER B line. I don't want to go with Eugénie. Hurry up, Jean. Can I come with you one day? Hurry up! No. Can I come tomorrow? It's not hard to understand. If you don't like it, you can leave. I wasn't obliged to have you all to stay here. Look. Let's change the tone. I'm sorry. I don't want to stay long either. When are we eating? We're hungry! Don't you have any hands? Can't you serve the food? What would you do if I wasn't here? Mum? - Yes. Why aren't the others dressed like me? How are they dressed? Come here. They don't have suits. You look fine. You have class, you're going to win. OK? Now, off you go. Good luck! Jean! What's the matter? Nothing. - Huh? Nothing. - How did you get on? So? - It was bad. Bad? - Yes. Why? Because. - Because what? So tell me? Where did you come? Third. - You came third? Yes. Third's really good! Thirty people did the exam and you came third! You were one of the best. I wanted to be first. Third isn't first. My little man, this is the same as winning! You beat them all! Come here. Mum is so proud of you! My little man. Hi. - How are you? Fine and you? - Good. Are your boys OK? Yes, they're fine. What's up? Well… I'm going to Marseille on Monday. I'm sorry, I didn't dare tell you but I have to leave. You have a woman there? - No. Absolutely not. It's for work. Ernest, can you lay the table? OK. You sit there. Jean, can you get the bread, please? Where is it? - Over there. No. Not like that, look. The fork on the left and the knife on the right. Whose is this? Yours? Boys, go and play in the other room, please. I'd prefer you to smoke outside, Rose. I'm not eating. I'm going to bed. Why aren't you eating? Do you think clothes will help you catch a man? You know what? You came to France but you're acting like a princess. You don't even know what you want. And you smoke as well. - Go away! How should I know? I didn't know she'd stay this long. Let's talk about it. I just think it's all a bit too much. Have you heard the neighbours talking? Have you heard? Mum, I like your bracelet. Do you know what this is? - No. These are my four boys. They're always with me. What if we became warriors. Let's put some warpaint on. We're a family of warriors! No, I don't want to be tickled! No! Pissarro! Pissarro! This is a good start! My horse, playing tricks on me again little fucker. Rather hard work. Hello. Good afternoon everyone. So… I'll stand here so you can all see me. Come closer! Is everyone here? My dear friends, hear that? That's a North-Northeast breeze. We're under the wind, the wildfowl can't smell us. So, it's my great pleasure to welcome you all here, to the place where my grandmother, my mother and I were all born. In fact, if you look up there that little oval window on the right is where I was born. So you can imagine how moved I am to organise this day in the country with you here today and to be able to honour this family tradition so dear to my heart. You're all devoted body and soul to my hotels and I wish to thank you all for your commitment and your loyalty and those who wish to do so can come hunting with me this afternoon. I hope this day will be unforgettable. I owe you, in fact France owes you a great deal. If the hunt is good you'll take home the rewards of this great moment of tradition and heritage. Have fun, enjoy yourselves. Let's get to know one another and that's it! Everything's free, this isn't a scam, so… May the party begin! Once there was a little man His name was Compère Guilleri To the woods he did a hunting go A hunting for a partridge Tra la la, tra la lee Compère Guilleri. Would you, would you, would you, Leave yourself for dead? Sorry! Am I in your way? I'm heading off to Rouen. Before I go would you care to share my breakfast? So what's this town? Rouen? It's in Normandy. That's where I live. In fact my brother's here in Paris. He's ill. So I often come to see him. It's the least I can do. I often see you here but you don't seem interested in me. True. You look like your name should be Paul. Ah, sorry, my name's Thierry. Thierry, like the wine? Château-Thierry wine. You know what's good, then. I tasted it once but I didn't like it, I don't know… I've tried lots of things in France but… wine… I don't like it. - OK. What about the coffee and the croissants? Coffee's French? I love coffee. Can I have your sugar? - Of course. I'm in a relationship. So am I. She announced we were moving to Rouen. A small two-roomed flat in the centre of town. We'd go to good schools. We'd meet nice people. She wanted the best for us. Life at the Château… Château-Thierry. We didn't want to leave the cupboard. She wasn't the type to change her mind. She packed our cases and we left. Your character looks like Tintin. Tintin with fat legs. His legs are fatter than his body. Why am I turning there? I don't want to! You're not doing it right. I need to show you. - Kick. Those aren't the right controls. Look. - Come on, come on. Hang on let me show you. Start again, you can do it. Doing homework with you is so hard. Read it again. You're not even trying. The greengrocer bought all his goods… Sounds like you're beaten before you start. Carry on. The tomatoes sell for 5 francs/kg. They make up 1/3 of the stock. Apples, at 4 francs/kg, make up 1/4 of the stock. Goodnight. - Night, sleep well. You too. Let's consider Charles Pasqua's bill for a moment. It marks an important turning point in French politics regarding immigration. This bill contains new provisions but also older ones which are displayed loud and clear. There's one golden rule: the right to enter France must be restricted. Jean, wake up, its ten past eight. So for this, we'll use qualitative analysis which will help you guess very quickly which filter you're going to work on. In particular when we're using capacitors. Has everyone copied this? OK for everyone? Right, we'll come back to that later. So: the impedance of a capacitor is 1/JC Ohms. So, I'll correct that straight away, when you put the J there, we're in complex form. So don't forget the minus, I'm circling it in red. It often gets forgotten. "It's a green hollow where a river sings" "Madly clinging to grass rags of silver" "Where the sun shines on the proud mountain" "It's a little valley, glistening with sunlight." "A young soldier, open mouthed, bare headed," "The nape of his neck bathed in cool blue watercress," "sleeps" "He lies on the grass under the skies" "Pale in his green bed where the light rains down" "Feet in the gladiolas, he is sleeping." "Smiling like a sick child might smile," "He is dozing:" "Nature rock him warmly: for he is cold." "Sweet scents no longer tickle his nose;" "He sleeps in the sun, his hand on his breast," "Peacefully." "In his right side are two red holes." The Sleeper in the Valley. Wash up, then recite it. - I need more time! Learn it while you're washing. Look out! Hang on. - Ernest the chef! Better make it an omelette. For the moment it's nothing. Hang on. Hi, you've reached Ernest, Jean and Rose. Please call us back later. Thank you! To the left. To the right. - To the right. To the left. You remember the neighbour… when you were little. There was a guy and two girls who used to sing. Faster. Morning my boy! Morning. Did you sleep OK? Yeah, how about you? OK. Eat your bread. I'll be here Friday morning instead of Friday night now. Every week? - Yes! It's confirmed. Pass the sugar, please. Still taking sugar? Look, I don't mind stopping smoking but coffee without sugar is just too hard. Did you see Esteban's mum? There's a cleaning job in a school near here. That woman! I called her three times. She never got back to me. When I come to Rouen, it's to see you, not to spend my time looking for a job. And next year you'll have exams. There'll be school fees to pay if you pass the entrance exam. Good job you're only here weekends. Frankly, this is just not on. I clear up all week, you arrive and it's a mess. Oh come on, it doesn't matter. Look sweetie, whether I'm here or not you're mad at me. What can I do? Last Tuesday, Julius Caesar invited me for coffee. Is that guy still around? He's getting divorced. His wife… completely crazy. Him and his hairstyle. He looks like Kool and the Gang. Kool and the Gang? Yeah, you're right. Did Thierry come to see you? No? - No. You need a new tracksuit don't you? I only wear jeans now. - You need socks too. We'll go to the shopping centre because I don't why, all the Zazous have closed down. I'll look at records. You do what you like. Records? What good will that do you? You don't understand. So what's up with Château-Thierry? Nothing's up. Is it because of us? You know it's not. He has a lot of work. He has a lot of work. Here. Know what? You have a lot of work too. So how's Mademoiselle Camille? She's fine. She's revising for the entrance exam in Paris. So she got into her school. That's good. That's good. She hasn't been accepted yet. But I know she will be. It's another world, eh? It's good to have a girlfriend but it's better to study hard. There are priorities in life. Now's the time you need to focus. You need to work hard. What do you want to eat tonight? I'm not hungry. On Thursday morning the individual interviews start at 8 am sharp. What if I fail? Stop that. Anyway, if you fail you'll do something else just as good. I'll do something else. If I do something else it's bad? - Oh, go on. What would you do? When I was little I liked dancing. Oh, come on. That's not a real profession. What is, then? I don't know. Pilot? So you're putting ladybirds on my face, eh? I see. Pretty mama paradise Dance with me paradise You say you don't want to Those girls now trouble belly Two days, three days, see baby coming Five days, ten days, see baby coming Mama asking who done that to you Papa asking who done that to you My guy there who done that to me So pack your bags, go to him Papa sorry, it's the first time I won't do it again So, why did you bring me here? Why not? Can you lend me some money? Wasn't your mum here this weekend? Yes, but she's leaving today. Is something up? No. Here's your order. How much do you have on you? - I don't know, look. You're doing the ear thing again, huh? Because you know I can't do it, huh? The good news is Elsa's pregnant. I thought you didn't want children. You always remember what suits you. So Jean and Ernest aren't children? That's nothing to do with it. I care a lot for them. This wasn't planned. It's happened unexpectedly and it's made me want to be a dad. That's all. I can't force you to do anything. If you want to stop seeing me, OK. I've always been straight with you. No one forced you to move here. No one lied to you. Remember, it's not you who's being lied to. Isn't stopping totally rather violent? Violent doesn't mean the same thing for me. Violent doesn't mean the same thing for me. Do you know what violence is? Do you? What do you do in your life? You don't work, you catch trains, drink wine, have fun. Don't start that again. For you everything's difficult. I'm the bad guy, while you slave away. Change your tune, eh? You're important to us. All you've done with them. That's important! - You want to make me guilty, again! You've no idea what the consequences will be for them. See? You force things! - What? You always do. - What? Do you hear me? You don't want to hear. Stop! I can't do this. - Mum. What are you doing here? Really Mum, you deserve better. What is this? Unbelievable! We moved to Rouen for your stupid mug. One day you took us bowling and then that was it for 3 months. You know what? We're not yours, OK? Mum, let's go. Jean, leave us. - Come on, mum! Jean, this is not your affair. Go sit with your girlfriend. Get up. Jean, stop it. So what now? - Stop. Punch your step father? What's going on? Jean, are you OK? Are you alright? Jean, I'm sorry. - Are you ok? Do you want some? What's in your bag? What? What's in your bag? Come on. Will that do? Did you rent a suit for tonight? You told me to dress up. Well, yeah, but… It's a viewing with my parents, not a cocktail with Lady Di. That's a really smart suit. We misunderstood each other. Hey, it doesn't matter. You can still wear it. Come here. We could revise here, in the garden. What's going on? It must be Christmas. I'm finally invited to yours. I need to practice talking about art for my orals. Apparently it helps to be cultivated. If you say your spiel, show your expertise, they see you know your stuff. People notice. They see you go the extra mile. They're captivated. Afterwards marks aren't important. It's you they want. Don't you agree? What do you expect from life? - What? What do you expect from life? I dunno. Stop all your dumb metaphysical stuff. Life is all around us. You take what you want. Or not. I don't know. We're free to choose. I'm going to look for a dress, OK? Camille? Coming! Make yourself at home. Welcome. Not bad. It's a bit cold isn't it? Shall I turn the heating on? - Yep. Do you eat this stuff? This. Yeah. My little sister eats this shit. It's pure sugar. I quite like it. Why doesn't this work? Forget the heating. It doesn't matter. Is beer OK? Beer? Perfect. Do you like Paris? Yes I like Paris. Who doesn't like Paris? Thanks. I lived in Paris for 5 years. Which neighbourhood? In the 15th. It was crap. Oh yeah? It looks cool, chic. Yeah it was chic. It's chic to say chic. Watch out! Oh dear. - Not chic. Too bad. Not chic. Not at all chic. - No. Thanks. No, I'll have that one. Sorry. Same again. Here. - Thanks. How old are you? 25. And you? 29. And you? You're not 25. I am. - You're not. I swear I'm 25. You can't fool me. - I'm not trying to. What's with the suit? Who are you really? OK, I get your style. Wait a sec. Hang on. - What? Right, sleeves. OK. Hang on I said. - What? Wait. What? Like this? Not exactly. Hey, man! What? - Actually get off me. This isn't OK. No, no! This is not on. Get off me! Are you stupid or what? You're hurting me! Sorry. - Fuck. You've watched too much porn! What's the kid doing there? Look, forget it. What is this shit? I'm out of here. Who was that? I waited for you all evening. Fuck off! I'm sorry, Ernest! Félix and Romain want to know if you'll let them travel free when you're a pilot. Félix is taking us fencing. He goes on Saturdays. Do you want some cheese? Do you think Mum will let me go away this summer? What? I told you. Romain's parents have a holiday home. They've invited me this summer. Ketchup? What's up? Hello boys. I should've told you but I wanted to surprise you. Hello Ernest. Hello Jean. I'm finally leaving my hotel job. Jules is coming to work near Rouen. We're going… to move in together and get a new flat. And we're getting married. So that's it. It's a new start. A new start. More like the start of the end. He said "A new friend". That's not what you said. Jean! I'm talking to you! Jean, come here! Repeat what you said. Come here. What's this about? Nothing. I'm not talking to him, that's all! Jean, what's going on? What are you doing every day? Outside Jean told her he hadn't presented himself for a single exam. He was hardly working any more. She kept on repeating the word "delinquent". Just like on the news, over and over again. She needed reasons for his failure to console herself, to calm her deep disappointment. Hello Ernest. He looks good without a beard, eh? - Yes. Rose, if you like we could have Jean to stay for a while. No, thank you. Let's talk about that another time. That boy… the army would do him a lot of good. Why the army? - Because he needs a framework to teach him certain basic principles. He has no respect for anything. He's not a bad boy, that's not what I mean but he needs to pull himself together. Stop his hare-brained projects. Just a minute Jules, Jean is a very intelligent boy. Félicien, I'm not talking about intelligence. This is about mindset. Let's be serious here! Credible. Calm down. We're talking about an entrance exam with what… a 2% success rate? He's gone downhill that's all. Sorry… I think I got a bit carried away. It's OK. Thanks. Camille! Camille! What the hell, it's 3 am! - Calm down. I'm not opening the door. This isn't a hotel! Let me in! Quick! So, how did the move go? - It went OK. Is your new flat nice? - Yes it's nice. It's much bigger. Does that mean you'll change schools next year? Yes. I'm sure you'll find a way to keep seeing each other. It'll be complicated because of the distance. I'll have to get the train. You know you'll always be welcome here? Yes, I know. - Even without advance warning. You tell your mum that! - I will. I mean it. - OK. I'd like to come back here. How is your mum? - She's fine. It's weird, when she was in Paris I wished she was home with us and now she's home with us… It's weird. - That's true! We never know where we are with you. Standing side by side, on some rising ground, they felt, as they drank in the air, the pride of a life more free penetrating into their souls with an superabundance of energy, a joy which they could not explain. A joy which they could not explain. Help! OK, I'm ready to have a siesta now. Turn me the other way! Come on guys, time to eat. You do realise that you don't like cows but you'll be with them, even if they're dead, all day long if you plan to be a butcher? But some people will be glad because they like meat. So you're transforming something you don't like into something you like? Well yes, especially as I love garlic sausage. The sheep's laughing. So are you with anybody? - No, and you? I had a boyfriend but we didn't really like each other. It didn't work out. Don't you guys have girlfriends? - No. I'm the only one. - Apparently. You guys are shy, it's embarrassing! Do you want to be in love? Be with someone again or not? Be in love? But do you want to be in a relationship again? Well, yeah. But no pressure, huh? You'd like to? - Yep. So you guys, what's the most important quality you look for in a girl? I mean, like, if she's your girlfriend? For you, what is it? Very good question. She needs to be kind. Kind? - Oh, I dunno. I'd like her not to shout all the time. That'd be really good. She'll be calm. For me, it's not about her physique, I don't care about that, but I'd like her to be intelligent, a bit of everything. I wouldn't like it if the person didn't care about me, notice me. OK. And what about you? Me? I'd like her to have a sense of humour. I'd like her to be funny. Otherwise it'd be a pain. - I agree. If your girlfriend isn't kind… - Isn't funny. Doesn't care about you and isn't funny. You make a joke and she takes it wrong… She takes you literally. That's so annoying. - Annoying, it's a pain. So where are you from? - Rouen. No, but your home country. - This is my home country. And before Rouen? In the Paris suburbs. And before that? I don't know. I don't remember. So what's your favourite film? I don't have a favourite film. Everyone has a favourite film. Well, I like football. I like action films as well. What about you? What's your favourite film? I like all the films with Winona Ryder. Who's Winona Ryder? - You know that American actress. Never heard of her. - Forget it. What's up? Nothing. Are you gonna kiss me? - What? Hurry up! The parents will be here soon. Come. Come on, let's go, it's raining. I'm going to bed. It was cool, eh? Is something wrong? - No, I'm OK. Have you read that? No I haven't. So what's up with you? I feel like I've got a salty taste after kissing Ludivine. I feel weird. Like I've got stomach ache. Salty? Yeah. Let's have a look. Ludivine isn't salty. What are you on about? It was cool with her wasn't it? - Yes. Better than smelling your gob. Night. - Goodnight. Aha! So how was it? - Brilliant! Looks like it was. Jean are you in the shower? It's Jules in the bathroom. Come here. Where's Jean? Sweetie, I wish things could have turned out differently. Your brother's left. Why? After what happened it was the best solution. You were on holiday, we didn't want to bother you. Why? Have some water. Sit down. These last weeks your brother went too far. It was… Things had become unbearable. He tried to steal Jules's cheque book. He was taking drugs. The police came round several times. He was hanging out downstairs with people… bad people. People who were… I've never seen your brother like that. So where is he? Say what you've got to say. It couldn't go on like that. Where is he? He's gone back home. He's with your brothers. He's with my uncle. He'll be alright. It's best for everyone. For all of us. He was headed for trouble. Don't touch me. I hate you! I don't want to see you ever again! I think I'm afraid of time because each day I think "have I done everything I wanted to do" and the answer's no because I always want to do more so I think even if I've lots of time in my life I feel like I'm not using it well. Victoria? - I think the more memories we have the faster time passes the more we live in the past. For example when we were little we didn't think about time passing but now we're in our senior year we're at a turning point in our lives where we realise that our childhood is over. Victoria, don't stress about "turning point". We have plenty of time to… I find being totally in the present hard. I can't manage a second without thinking about something else. OK, it is difficult. Nobody said it was easy. Momo? - I think this is too serious. Meaning? Do you know what makes me happy? It's looking into Julia's eyes. They're so beautiful. Good. Very good. I think earlier we said when we no longer have what made us happy that's when you realise you were happy. Consequently, death is… well actually no, because you're dead but then is there consciousness after death? Julia? - I'm not afraid of death, I'm more afraid of being retired than dying. I mean, at a certain age what's worse than everything stopping is that you have time, but can't necessarily do what you'd like to. You can't plan too far ahead because at some point it's empty. Getting old freaks me out. OK, but… - I'm scared I'll be bored. It's a notion. The future doesn't belong to us. We'll see that in Blaise Pascal's piece. It doesn't belong to us and that's probably what frightens you. Sir, are you scared of the future? Am I scared of the future? Good question but it's a question I don't ask myself. The only thing I'm worried about is you lot passing your Bac. "Let each of us examine his thoughts. He will find them wholly concerned" with the past or the future. We almost never think of the present, and if we do think of it, it is only to see what light it throws on our plans for the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means. The future alone our end. Thus we never actually live but hope to live." I.D. check. Stand over there, sir. Hello. - You have I.D. on you? Actually I just popped out and I left my papers… Search him. - This is an identity…? Hey! Calm down please, sir. You've no proof of I.D. on you? - No. So, let my colleague search you or we go to the station, OK? Fine. It's obligatory? - This is normal procedure. Move along please. Nothing to see here. Name please? Ernest Koffi. - Surname? Koffi. K-O-F-F-I. First name? Ernest? - Ernest. Date of birth? - March 5th, 1984. Where were you born? - Abidjan. Where's that? - Ivory Coast. What? - Ivory Coast. OK. Wait there. So what nationality is sir? - French. Is everything in order? - Yes. Your profession, sir? - I teach philosophy. Huh? - I was correcting essays, I just came out to buy coffee. With no I.D.? I was in a hurry. I wasn't… Well listen to me, Mister Obama, come out with no I.D. again it'll be 4 hours in custody. Got that? Understand? You're free to go. Have a good day. - Goodbye. I'm glad to see you. Before I forget, here. This is for you. Why are you looking at me like that? Do you have something you want to tell me? Are you happy? I'm OK. I want to go back to work. I'm bored. Haven't you done enough where that's concerned? I want to work. Why don't you keep in touch? Are you well? Are you OK? I'm OK. Last year I guess I wasn't very well, but I'm OK now. Why? What was the matter? Nothing. Just a bit of a bad patch. You blame me because you had no father? Because I had no father? No! I had loads of fathers. And then there was school. School was my dad. I still can't figure out how you work. You hang out with white people too much. Poisoned by their imaginary diseases. Depression… That's not for us, all that. So how's work going? Do they treat you OK here? I don't work here anymore. I'm a teacher. What? I don't believe you! - It's true. That's great! Congratulations my son. I'm so happy for you. I'm a student teacher but I got the exam. After all your failed attempts I thought you'd have given up. That's great then! What's important is to succeed. That's what's most important to you? What else is there? Besides a job, a home and family, what is there? The rest is peanuts. So yes. The most important thing is that you succeed. And if not? - If not what? If I hadn't passed? If not what? What are you thinking? If not what? You passed the exam so… If I hadn't called you'd never have said! I wouldn't be here. You'd have said nothing. What were you thinking of? I'm glad. It's great. What's the matter, Ernest? You're mad at me aren't you? Why are you mad at me? I did everything possible. Even if I made mistakes… You did your best. Lovely scarf. You can buy scarves now. - Yes. I love scarves. They're so soft. Thanks for noticing. Yes, I noticed. It suits you. Why are you in Paris? - I came to Paris to see you. Because I worry about you. And I'm getting old. The other day, I thought you were in Thailand and that you'd been carried away by the tsunami. Here I am. And I came to tell you that I'm going back home in October. Again? - Yes, for six weeks. It's been three years already. I'm homesick. I'd love you to come with me one day. When could we do that? I don't know. What about Jules? Isn't he going? - Julius Caesar. We're splitting up. He exhausted me. He's so complicated. If you called your mother more often you'd know all this. I was going out tonight. Shall I cancel? What does she do? When's the wedding? Everyone's waiting. - Mum. Please, not that. - What's the hold up? If you don't marry what's the point of anything? Nobody gets married. Stop talking nonsense. I'm taking one of these. Just a little one. Thanks for the rice and the sauce. You're so handsome. But you need to take care of yourself better. Your hair. It looks dirty. You should cut it. It's not part of the plan. I like your shirt. Nice colour. That's a good quality shirt. I want to give you a cuddle. It was different before, you'd put your head on my shoulder while we watched telly in Rouen. Everything's changed. With your stern expression. - Are you surprised? Oh, this arrived. It's for you. Ernest, I often think of you. Especially in the evenings when I pray. God is good. He's always there for me. I have a favour to ask of you: If you could help me pay for my driving licence so I can drive a taxi it would help me a lot. I hope you're well and in good health. I wish you peace, happiness, good fortune and joy and above all, the success in your life that you deserve. I'm proud of you. Write to me. I hope to see you again one day. It's no small thing, a little brother.
