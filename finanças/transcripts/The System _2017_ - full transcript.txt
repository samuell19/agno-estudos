You should come around the house more, all right? Kick with Junior, he look at you like a big brother anyways. Just want you to shine, nephew. - She been riding me about shit for no reason. - Watch your mouth. I know your mama. And I know she wants the best for you. - I gotta take this. Hello? Are we done? - No, we ain't done, get off the phone. - I gotta call you back. - Hang up the phone now. Hey, man, don't get it twisted, I been through this shit. You hear me? You see Uncle Nate with the business, with the lil garage, the family man, but I been through the fire, Trey. That's why your mama wanted me to talk to you. Tell you a story. I ain't never told nobody this story. I need you to keep a secret. I mean, you can't tell nobody, Trey. - All right. - Me and your mama came up rough. Growing up in the '90s was bittersweet. When our pops went to prison, things changed. We moved right in the hood, right next to the dope spot. There was always loud music, parties going on. It was crazy. I seen somebody die for a dice game, Trey. Mama always seemed to make things right. She always had a smile on her face. Playing the brand new cassettes in a boom box. Music blasting, cleaning up the house. That's probably why I like music so much. Til Claw came by. - Can't test me for real. - I don't fucking like that. - My mama boyfriend. Would abuse us for years, catch us staring at her, being like, what you looking at, little nigger? - Get in the house. - Honestly, I would dream of the day I was old enough to beat his ass for what he did to us. That'd be a day that'd change my life forever. Streets is crazy. One day Mom and Amina left. I went through his stuff and... Found a little weed. I just wanted to try it. Caught me. - The fuck is you doing going through my shit, smoking my damn weed? Your mama beat your ass if she knew you was in here. - Got me drunk. - Yeah, little man, yeah, something to smoke, huh? Smoke this. - Made me smoke PCP with him. Mind spinning, luckily I didn't hit it that hard but between that and the handy, I was done. - How long you been smoking now, homie, huh? Huh, nigger? - Then he tried to kill me. - Smoke my shit, huh, you wanna put your hands on me, nigger, get your ass back here, nigger. I'll cut you to pieces right now, motherfucker. Scared, little nigger, scared, huh? You wanna run home to your mama, little pussy, huh? Oh shit, fuck! Fuck! - I ran off. Everything was spinning. The whole night was kind of blurry. - Who are you? - I woke up in this backyard. - What are you doing here? - And there was a little girl there, tried to help me. - How'd I get here? I don't feel-- - Come inside. I'll have my parents help. - And then her dad came out with a shotgun. - Oh my God. - That'll be far enough. - He's lost. - Abby, get in the house, right now. - I mean, I'd been called a nigger before, but-- - Get off my property now, before you wish you had never been born, you fucking nigger. - That shit cut. I ran til I couldn't run no more. - Hey, man, ain't that lil-- - I passed out again. - Damn, that is lil Nate. - Nate, you all right? - Then I remembered my mom and Amina was coming back. - He don't smoke weed. - My weed and shit, you need to get on him-- - He doesn't do anything. - And it hit me. - Mama. - I gotta get home. When I got there, they was still fighting. I walked in, he had the devil in his eye. I knew I was gonna die that night. - Going through my-- - Check him? - Check his ass up. - He's a child! - There we go. - No! No! - Get the fuck off me. - Right there. - I seen him laying on the floor. Blood everywhere. - Amina, give me the gun. - Just know that day, your mom saved all our lives. - I shot him, you hear me? - From that day on, I never touched drugs or a gun again. I swore, Trey. If I ever had a family, I'd be the best father I could, so I started my business. And the rest is history. I never told nobody that story before, and I'm telling you 'cause you're fucking up. - Are you serious, Nate? Go upstairs, Trey, now. - Hey, but it was self defense, all right? Come by the shop, man, I wanna see your face. - I will, Uncle Nate. - Nate, I'm an attorney and the last thing I need is for that story to get out. - I know. Trey won't tell nobody. - Dear Pops, I hope by the time you get this letter, everything's good. I wanted to write you so many times. First, I was just upset. You left when I was a kid. After Mama passed, just felt like it's been too long. I would ask myself, what would you think about me now writing? I received your letters, and yes, of course you can stay with us. I'm married now. I got a beautiful wife. Her name's Tatiana. And a son, Nate Junior. He's 13. He was born deaf, but it never held him back. He's now learning to read lips. He loves baseball and video games. - All right, look, man, keep your eye on it, all right? Here, use your heart, man, come on. Yeah, like that, like that, throw with your heart, stay with it. - He's good. You taught him good. - That boy, he's too big. We gotta do something with his hair, though, cut all this off. - No, no, you look at this hair, he's the same. - I know Mama, rest in peace, always said you was a good man, just a victim of circumstance. I've always tried to keep my nose clean. Own my own business now. I got four employees. Maybe I could teach you how to work on cars too. I understand how easy it is to get caught up in the system. The other day I was picking up a friend from work when two cops pulled us over. - License and registration, right now. - Man, this is some bullshit. - Chicago. - Really, you're not from around here. - Nah. - So what are you doing here, then? See what we got in these pockets, keep your hands out of your pockets, put your hands up, put 'em on the hood. - Apparently there was a robbery around the corner, couple black guys, mid 20s. We fit the description. - We had a bad night sometimes, all right, it happens? - I got a red 300, they're looking for a Camaro, believe it or not, he helped me out that night. - Sam. I think we should let Becca go out with her friends again. It's been long enough. - Why the fuck are you whispering? - I just-- - You don't need to whisper. We're the parents, remember? - Tinnitus again? - No. I'm fine, it's just eight hours on a beat and now this shit? - Hey, well, just stay calm and no arguments, okay? - I'm calm. Fuck, all right, let's just get this shit over with. - Becca, your father and I have something we would like to tell you. - Your mother and I have agreed to let you go out with your friends, but on the condition that you stop seeing Mohammed. - But Dad. - You know what, this is not negotiable. - It never is. - You want to tiptoe and whisper around this fucking house? You deal with her. - I hate him. - Sam, good to see you, thanks for coming down. - As always. - Sam, I appreciate you coming. I've got a little bit of a problem. I really could use your help with it. My sister's kid, my nephew, he seems to have got himself mixed up into a drug deal, something went bad and it's related to some guys in your department. He's locked up in county but they haven't sent it over to the DA's office yet, so there's still some time. - Yeah. You're gonna owe me, all right? - Yeah, you got it, yeah, anything. - This is fucking bullshit. - Shit, it ain't here. - Did you check the engine? - I checked the whole fucking car. - It's all right. - It's fucking bullshit. - They ain't gonna find nothing, man. - Hey, hey, where's it at, where'd you hide your fucking stash? - I don't know what you're talking about, officer. - Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about? I've been following you for fucking weeks. Where's the stash, boy? - You don't know shit, kid, shit. - How 'bout you, how 'bout you? You know what I'm talking about, huh, you know what I'm talking about? - Won't say shit. - I've seen you go on ride alongs together for two weeks now. - Get back in the house, now! - Oh, no, no, no. - Check it out. - Put the fucking phone down, get back in the house, put the fucking phone down. - Ain't nobody scared of you, what is wrong, Officer? - Put the fucking phone down, put the fucking phone down. Give me that motherfucking phone. - Are you serious? - You're gonna let him put a gun to his head? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Settle the fuck down. - Whoa, everybody be cool, partner, hey, hey, okay, look, hey, if you care about-- - You goddamn bitch. - If you care about your brother, I'm gonna need you to step back, back up. - I'm going, I'm backing up, all right? - This is bullshit! - All right, chill. - Crooked ass shit. - Y'all free to go, sorry for the inconvenience. - Hey, hey, remember me, Officer, 'cause I'ma see you on the street one day, yeah, remember me. I'ma see on the street, then we gonna see what's up. - Are you fucking kidding me, right now? Did you really have to do that? - I got your badge, I'ma see you, bitch. - Let's go right now. - Okay, you and I are gonna go over some lip reading techniques, okay? I see the dog. I see the car. I see the house. Okay? I, hang on one second, let me get my phone, one sec. Okay, again, sorry 'bout that. No, you're sweet, you don't have to do that, that's yours. No, no, no, that's yours, you're sweet, no, no, no, thank you. - When I heard my mother tell my father she was having another baby, the fear inside me... And then I heard my father say, get rid of it. During dinner I watched my mother, I wanted to help her. My mother's last minute stays with me. - We'll get you out of here, you hurt, you hurt, huh? Keep this pistol, keep this pistol. - Yep, yep, yep. - We gotta go now, guys, we can catch another one but we gotta go now! - Time to go, brother. - Gotta go now! - You okay? - How was your day? You not sleeping? You know I love you. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. - The fuck was that? - What are you talking about? - You know what, the fucking head thing, what the fuck, looks like he's calling you over. - It's a hood thing, like what's up. - All right, whatever. - How am I supposed to do it? - You do it in a downward motion, like. Like they do in England. - We're not in England. - President Trump has a rally that he's planning tonight in Phoenix Arizona in the midst of heightened political tensions due to the violence in Charlottesville that happened less than 10 days ago. - Mayor Greg Stanton has recently been in the news and the headlines for asking Trump to delay his campaign style rally. In a recent CBS interview, he said I believe the true intention is really to inflame people's passion to further divide the country and that's why I said this president should delay this trip to Phoenix. President Trump is drawing criticism from both sides of the aisle based on his statements for wanting to pardon Sheriff Joe Arpaio. - Are they still out there? - Yeah, they still out there. They just out there for Mose. - I don't know why they can't just go do what they do somewhere else. - Don't worry about them.

This shit can go all wrong. I don't need anybody coming after me. - Nate Wesley Junior, a young man tragically murdered in our community, and I'm certain by now you have heard the story. Officer Sam Lynch, the officer who shot and murdered Nate Wesley Junior on an assumption and that assumption was that Nate Wesley Junior was carrying a loaded weapon. And by the way, Officer Sam Lynch did not realize that Nate Wesley Junior was also deaf and could not communicate effectively with him in that situation. Ladies and gentlemen, we must have reform in our law enforcement so that officers come out of the law enforcement community ready and able to disseminate and break down situations without having to use deadly force. It's a tragic event and should never have happened. That's the final thought for this evening. Thanks for joining us. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow night. - Hey, Sam, how you doing? Good to see you. So listen, how you holding up, buddy? - I mean, fucking media's dragging me through the streets. - I been there, and they're gonna do that, too, but that's why it's important that you get out there and get your story out, okay? I've seen the media, and they're gonna paint this picture however they want to. - Yeah, tell me about it, they're calling me a fucking racist, I got a black Pastor, I'm not a fucking racist, all right? - Hey, hey, that's bullshit, okay?

We are saddened, we sit here in awe of the events that took place. - Okay, can I have everybody's attention here? Officer Lynch is going to make a short statement and then he'll take some questions. Officer Lynch? - Ladies and gentlemen of the press, on behalf of the city police department, I would like to apologize for the tragic events that have brought us here today. - We have to talk about the situations that are really going on, senseless deaths that shouldn't be taking place, our young Nate was full of life. His life was brought down way too soon. There's things that young Nate will never get to experience. - As tragic as these events are, I still contend that I behaved within the bounds of police protocol. - Okay, okay, quiet down, one at a time. - Young Nate Junior... Was a young boy full of life, full of great opportunity, and it was snatched away at the hands of someone who was supposed to protect and serve. - Officer, were you aware that the boy was deaf at the time that you shot him? - I was not aware that the boy was deaf, no. - Officer Lynch, Officer Lynch. Have you had an opportunity to speak with the boy's parents yet? - I have not yet had an opportunity to speak with the boy's parents. - Officer Lynch, do you intend to speak to the boy's family? - He'll never get a chance to go to prom. We'll never get to see him walk across that stage and graduate from high school. He'll never get a chance to walk onto a college campus and experience life on his own. He'll never get a chance to meet the love of his life. He'll never get a chance to stand at the altar and watch his bride walk down the aisle. - Look, I did what I thought had to be done. Any good cop would've done the exact same thing. - Okay, okay, okay, no more questions, no more questions, no more, no more, he's done, he's done. - Y'all, I wrote this song in honor of Nate Junior and this is my expression and reflection of his life and his legacy, you know? ♪ This house that you see ♪ ♪ May look like a rundown shack, yeah ♪ ♪ But it's been a good home to me ♪ ♪ And I'll never take it back ♪ ♪ I may not ♪ ♪ I may not have much ♪ ♪ But I got a whole lotta heart ♪ ♪ Oh, yes I do ♪ ♪ You heard on the news ♪ ♪ They flashed my picture across the screen ♪ ♪ Before they ever knew my name ♪ ♪ They already made a decision about me ♪ ♪ I may not ♪ ♪ I may not have much ♪ ♪ But I gotta whole lotta heart ♪ ♪ Oh, yes I do ♪ ♪ For years ♪ ♪ I used to sing ♪ ♪ That this is the land of the free, yeah ♪ ♪ But nowadays I'm starting to wonder ♪ ♪ If that part of the song ♪ ♪ Was written for me ♪ ♪ I'm a simple man ♪ ♪ But I live a complex life ♪ ♪ So I got walk by faith, y'all ♪ ♪ And not by sight ♪ ♪ I may not ♪ ♪ I may not have much ♪ ♪ But I gotta whole ♪ ♪ Lotta heart ♪ - I'll see you soon. - I'll see you soon. - Still fucking that cop? - Man, why are you butting into my business?

Do you really want to know the truth, Rachel? - Yeah, tell me, stop lying to me, Sam, and tell me the truth. - I fuck her every chance I get. I'm not happy. I haven't been happy for a long time. I don't know if we can pick up the pieces. Right, there, that's the truth, you fucking satisfied now? Huh? - Hey, Sam. How are you doing? - Good, good. - You just take my lead, I've got your back, and everything's gonna be all right, okay? - Okay. - You can do this. - As long as I've known you, I ain't never known you to fuck up on no brakes. Gwen just called me and said she almost crashed on the freeway. - Tell her I'll fix it. - Bro, you need to go home. You need to spend time with your family, man. I love them like you, I've known you for a long time, bro. You go home. ♪ Love me the way ♪ ♪ The way that you do ♪ - I haven't seen you smile in a long time. - Mmm. - Now next up on the mic, this sisters rocks mics all over the United States, one of the best to ever do it, I want you to please give it up for Divine. - We're gonna get through this. - This poem is dedicated to Nate and Tatiana. I've missed you, thought about you when I wasn't supposed to I cared, I watched you walk away that day to play and smile and your silence was loud. You were special. And not many people knew how. And some didn't care. They took you right from under me, the system, the system wasn't built for you or me. They offered no apology. My baby is gone. Your heartbeat was my favorite song. Missing you hasn't been fun. I mean, I try to substitute for you in your absence, but no one else can do what you do, love how you love and look how you look. I want you back. With you there was balance, a sense of security, even if it lasted a little while, I wanted you with me. 'Cause I get that things change and people part ways, but we were one, so division wasn't an option. Son, I now know the meaning when someone says they feel torn apart. Feeling like your finish line never had a start. Thank you. Come on, guys, come on. - You know they say in ancient times that the sun would be fighting the moon and then the moon would fight the sun but the solar system has to have balance. A person can only bend so much til they break. If the sun woke up this morning and its shine was taken away, he would question his whole existence. If I break, I want the crackling of my roots to resonate throughout the universe. - Breaking news, Officer Sam Lynch will not be charged in the shooting death of Nate Wesley Junior. - I feel entirely justified in my actions. Kid was a known drug runner hanging out with known criminals My question is, where are the parents in all this, huh? - Protestors are already on scene from both sides. We will keep you up to date on the very latest. - What's happening with you, man, how you holding up? - You know they down there marching for you, man, I'm surprised you ain't at the march. - Fuck marches. - Man, fuck all that marching, bro. Marching for what? The police don't police they own, so we'll never get no conviction, we'll never get no justice. - Shit, feel me? - What's up, Nate? - Bro. - T-Moe in there? - What's up, man? - Man. - Need a strap, y'all. - Need a strap? - I need a strap, you got one or not? - You all right? - Good, man. - All right. Where you at? You need to get over here right now, yeah, like right now. All right. - How you find me? - T-Moe's my friend, remember? Nate, I know you're not about to do what I'm thinking. - What's that? - Listen to me. - What? - Don't do this. I'm in that courtroom every day. I know how this ends, it's not worth throwing away your life - Put a hole in his chest, I'm supposed to walk away? Huh? We kill each other every day for bullshit and now what, I'm supposed to march and protest and sing peace songs, fuck that shit. I ain't turning the other cheek. That shit stops today. I'ma ride for mine. - Then what? Hmm? You plan on having me represent you on a murder one charge? Pleading with the judge to forgive you and not give you the death penalty? Where's the honor in that? Our father spent most of our lives in prison. Ask him about honor. This is your life. This isn't a game, Nate. - You know what? We either stand for something, we gonna keep dying for nothing, excuse me. - So what happened? - Nobody wants to hang out with me because of what Dad did. They're calling him a murderer. I seriously can't take it anymore. And where is he? Mom, I heard you guys talking the other night and I know that he's seeing another woman. - It's complicated. It breaks my heart to know that you're going through this. Kids can be so mean, no one's hazing you though, right? - Nobody says that, they just... Unlike you. They don't like your comments or your photos on social media. They whisper. This fucking dog. Shut up, Cowboy. - Go untie him and bring him in the house. - This is so stupid. - You know, they're not really your friends. Oh don't, no, no- - Sit the fuck down. - Stop, stop! - Sit down, sit down. Go check the house, bro, go check the house. Where the fuck is he at? - Who, who? - Who, Sam, where the fuck is at? - I don't know. - Where is he at? - He's not here, I don't know. - Where is he at? Call him, call him. - Okay, yeah, okay. - Get him on the phone. - I'm calling, I'm calling. He's not answering, sorry, it's not him. - Fuck. - What you wanna do, bro? - You ever been robbed of something? Has somebody ever stole something from you? Yeah? I'm not talking about your fucking car or your little place at the country club. I mean some shit you can't replace. He used to steal my heart every time he smiled. His first steps-- I can't replace that shit. Do you believe in the Bible? Do you believe in the fucking Bible? - Yes. - Well, it says an eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. I've been fighting. I've been fighting. If I take something from him, I'll be even. - Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, you hurt, baby? You all right, hold on, hold on. You okay, you all right? What happened, who did this? - It was-- - I'll kill them. - Just some black guys with guns. Where were you, I called you. Where the fuck were you? They were pointing a gun at your daughter, okay, and you were gone, you were gone. It's probably those guys's son you murdered. We should call the police. We need to call the police. - No, look, baby, baby, I'm the police, all right? I'ma take care of this. It's all right. - It's your fault. - Motherfuckers, motherfuckers! - Sorry, man, we're closed, come back tomorrow. - You just couldn't let it go, huh? Come into my home, tie up my wife, my daughter? - You murdered my son. In cold blood! I coulda did the same to you. I'm not like you, though. - Hey, boss, I'm going. Oh, shit. - Back the fuck up! Go on, get outta here. - Hey, you see what he did, right? - This is Officer Sam Lynch, we've got shots fired in Nate's Garage, 1703 West 24th Ave. Need medical assistance. - This is Cadence Harper with the LA broadcast network and we are here live on the scene at Nate's Garage. We have just learned that Nate Wesley Senior has been shot after an altercation with Officer Sam Lynch. If you remember-- Officer Sam Lynch is the same officer in the deadly shooting of Nate Wesley Junior for wielding a toy gun. The question is, why is Officer Sam Lynch at the shop? Details are sketchy, but in a statement released by Officer Sam Lynch, he said that he went to the shop to apologize but Nate Wesley Senior pulled out a gun and he was forced to shoot him. We still don't know the condition of Nate Wesley Senior, but we do know that he is in police custody and hospitalized - That's what happened. I'm sorry, I... I can't leave. I can't leave my family. It made me realize what-- When you see your family's lives flash before you... - So you leading me on this whole time? - No. That's not what I mean, I-- I need to be there for my wife. My daughter, I'm sorry, this is... Look, I-- I can give you some money, if you want to get away for a while. - Where am I supposed to go, Sam? And leave my family? Where am I gonna go? Really? I don't want your fucking money, Sam. - Fine. I'm sorry. - Have a drink with me for old time's sake? - I don't think that's a good idea. All right, okay, it's okay, it's all right. - I gotta tell you I am relieved, fucking relieved. The system works. - You think this could actually be over? - It's like, I don't know what I was so worried about. All I had to do was just... Fucking, just put it on the ground. - Put what on the ground, Sam? - The gun, the fucking unlicensed, untraceable, it's always good to have one on hand in my line of work. - Sam Lynch decided to show up at Nathan Wesley Senior's shop to apologize, first of all, who does that? I mean, I guess I can kind of see it, you know, you want to be the bigger man and make that appearance and I do understand it, but it's just, it's such, so soon, fam, so soon? Listen, an altercation took place. Nate Wesley was shot and Sam Lynch is claiming that a gun was pulled on him, a little suspect, listen, phone lines are open, call us up, tell us what you think, I don't know who to believe. - How you doing? - Pretty shaken up. - Well, you ain't got to worry no more, okay? They got the guy, he's gonna be going away for a long time. - What about you? Are you going away too? - I'm not going anywhere. - What about Yolanda or Yesenia, whatever? - It's over. I told her last night. It's in the past. I love you. - I love you too. - I need y'all to turn with me today to Galatians six and seven, the word of God said be not deceived, God is not mocked for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. Understand, the devil wants you to act and react based on reactions, but understand God says, whatever you plant, if you plant positive, you'll reap positive, if you plant negative, you'll reap negative, God is not playing with us. God will make you pay for the things that you do. You better understand, God is a God of justice, God is a God of compassion, he's not a God of confusion, but he will make you pay for what you do. You will reap what you sow. You got to understand, God is not mocked. I'ma reaching out trying to save you while there's still time. You better do what's right in the eyes of the Lord. - The gun, unlicensed, untraceable. It's always handy to keep one handy while you're working. - You recognize the name Officer Sam Lynch? It's in the news again. If you are one of the 18 million people who has not seen this video that was released on YouTube three days ago, pay attention, there is graphic language, this is a warning. - A gun, unlicensed, untraceable. It's always handy to keep one handy while I work. It's actually kind of I told him I went over there to apologize. - Let's follow the timeline on this story. As you might remember, Officer Sam Lynch back in the spring shot and killed a 12 year old deaf boy by the name-- - Man, I knew that motherfucker was no good, man. - The grand jury heard the case and he was acquitted. A few months later, Officer Sam Lynch goes down to the office of Nate Wesley Senior, the boy's father, to apologize for the incident. Officer Lynch claims that the father, Wesley Senior, pulled a gun on him and in defense, he shot him. Well, this video tells a different story, doesn't it? - I've got your discharge paperwork here if you'd like to sign it. - After the release of this video, Officer Sam Lynch was arrested and is now being-- - Ladies and gentlemen if you haven't had a chance this afternoon to view any of the major news networks or hear anybody talking in the office by the water cooler, well, you're gonna see it tonight. Sam Lynch has been released from the county jail. He must have made bond because he was seen exiting the jail this evening. If you remember the infamous YouTube video that was released about a week ago showing video footage of Mr. Lynch talking about planting evidence at a crime scene, filmed, wait for it, by his mistress with her cell phone, well, that's all resurfacing again this evening and the nightmare continues for Ms. Lynch and I'm sure she is very unhappy with the news media tonight. - Yesenia! Yesenia, open up! Please. - Hey, fool, why you banging on my sister's door? You know she don't want to see you no more, homie. Yeah, you better bounce, motherfucker. - There's a funny feeling inside when you stop giving a fuck. When you just stop caring about the world because you realize the world don't give a fuck about you either. It's almost unnatural. I used to read the Bible a lot. And my mind keeps going back to a scripture I remember. To everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be born, a time to plant, a time to pluck up that is planted. And it also says there's a time to kill. - Well, first, I want to thank you for taking this meeting. I was formally charged a couple days ago and suspended from work and-- I understand that you were assigned my case, I'm supposed to appear before you, so I was hoping-- You might be able to help me out. - Sam, I know you did me a favor, but you're real hot on this one. The public is out for blood and the media's all over this. I cannot help you on this one. - You can't help me? You owe me, I got your nephew out of prison. - I understand that, look. I'm gonna ask you nicely and quietly. I think you need to leave. I shouldn't even be seen with you right now. - You think I need to-- - You need to go, Sam. You fucked up, you really fucked up, you planted evidence. I can't make that go away. - That man came into my home, he terrorized my family. What was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to let the law handle it. - I-- I'm a fucking police officer. I served my country. I'm a proud American. And this is how I'm treated? You're just gonna throw me under the bus? - Look, he's a good kid, he just made a mistake and I'd really appreciate it if you could help me get him out of this jam. - Yeah. - Yeah? - But you're gonna owe me. - Nothing I can do for you, Sam. I'm putting myself at risk just by meeting with you. - With everything that is within me telling me not to give a fuck, telling me to make you feel a fraction of the pain that you put me and my family through, pain that keeps me up at night. The pain that brought me here, right here, right now. I want the world to know that it's your time, motherfucker. - Let me go, no! - I watched him struggle as they laid him down on the ground. I thought how easy it'd be just to end his existence. It's at those moments that you gotta reach deep inside, the part that goes beyond not giving a fuck. And I knew it was my time to release all the pain that I felt about Nate Junior. - Watch your back. - Hey, hey, slow down, slow down. Aw, ese, ain't that motherfucking pig right there? That's him. - That is him, that motherfucker right there. - Pull up, pull up, ese, pull up, pull up. Remember me? - If you died today, would they remember you for you? Or judge you for who they thought you were? Growing up, you became accustomed to chaos. Your mother lost her life to it. But the way the world works, subtract and you add to it. A father holds his baby boy in his arms for the first time. Millions of thoughts racing through his head. I can't wait to teach him how to ride a bike. Show him how to play some ball. Him telling you about the girls in his life. What kinda impact will he make on the world? Kinda makes you smile, right? Can you imagine raising your son to be the man you always knew he could be, just for a coward with a gun to take him away? Black lives matter. The news'll tell you it's just a bunch of thugs and hoodlums breaking shit, as if my black life was a choice. See, America, you lack empathy. So allow me to emphasize the thoughts of my motor mind, see. You tell my people to be quiet when our children are being killed, why? Better him than me. You see it on the news, our children being dehumanized, why? This isn't news to me. This has been a problem, except now it's being televised. Fox is telling hella lies and America acting like they seeing through Hellen Keller's eyes. See, my view is omniscient. I seen it all, I seen it all. Seems like the only way out the hood is slinging rock or slinging a ball. And not all cops are bad, but man, I know it seems as such 'cause they're killing off our genes and it's lost between the scenes. It sucks, it seems to me that what the world is lacking is love. What you hear and what you see is a distraction from love. What you say and how you feel, I feel is actually love. And I hope you feel it from a passage above, love. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Baby, I know you ♪ ♪ You, you ♪ ♪ I know you seen a lot of things in your life ♪ ♪ Well, trust me ♪ ♪ Baby trust me ♪ ♪ Baby, trust me ♪ ♪ Baby, I know you ♪ ♪ You, you ♪ ♪ No, what about the times in your life ♪ ♪ When it was just me ♪ ♪ Just me and you ♪ ♪ Getting high ♪ ♪ Got no funds but we still got by ♪ ♪ Ain't got no gas ♪ ♪ I'ma set you straight ♪ ♪ Right on time ♪ ♪ I never showed up late ♪ ♪ Man, what about these homes ♪ ♪ We'd have made it to the top ♪ ♪ And that's without these hoes ♪ ♪ So give me trust or it's out that door with me ♪ ♪ And baby I can take your ass to stars, to Venus, yeah ♪ ♪ You, you, you, you ♪ ♪ And you are ♪ ♪ So very special to me ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ So special to me ♪ ♪ And you are, you are ♪ ♪ You, you, you, you ♪ ♪ And you are ♪ ♪ So very special to me ♪ ♪ So special to me ♪ ♪ You are, you are ♪ ♪ Push that body on me baby ♪ ♪ I love it when you ♪ ♪ Push me that body on me, baby ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I love it when you ♪ ♪ Push that body on me baby ♪ ♪ I love it when you ♪ ♪ Push that body on me baby ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, baby ♪ ♪ Yo, the other day I made my girl cry ♪ ♪ See, this is a fucked up world ♪ ♪ Like what the fuck is you crying for ♪ ♪ There's little children in villages ♪ ♪ Off in Africa watching their mothers die ♪ ♪ Paint a picture on just how real it gets ♪ ♪ I could think of a million things to cry about ♪ ♪ But I think sometimes you figure ♪ ♪ You got to cry it out ♪ ♪ Tough it out, I told her ♪ ♪ That's why I'm so insensitive ♪ ♪ At times I get so wrapped up in my situation ♪ ♪ Yes I did ♪ ♪ Time for a different perspective ♪ ♪ She's so inquisitive ♪ ♪ Acts as a detective ♪ ♪ And retrospects what it really is ♪ ♪ Being lied to, cheated on and spit upon ♪ ♪ Plus there's one man she tried to love ♪ ♪ Is dead and gone ♪ ♪ And all she needed was a father ♪ ♪ Where was you at? ♪ ♪ Way too drunk to think about your daughter ♪ ♪ Is what you said ♪ ♪ Up in her heart ♪ ♪ You tore your family apart ♪ ♪ You abused her so much ♪ ♪ Was that your plan from the start ♪ ♪ So much resentment from the constant ridicule ♪ ♪ She the fat girl in class ♪ ♪ She must've hated middle school ♪ ♪ But some constant jail visits ♪ ♪ Confidence made attainment ♪ ♪ Tried to think to steal ♪ ♪ Did you stop and think for a minute like ♪ ♪ I got a daughter who's growing up all alone ♪ ♪ Who thinks her daddy don't love her ♪ ♪ I'm thinking, like, was she wrong but ♪ ♪ See I ain't here to slander your name ♪ ♪ I'm glad that you came ♪ ♪ Rest in peace til your body's remains are gone ♪ ♪ And I know you ♪ ♪ I know you seen a lot of things in your life ♪ ♪ Well, trust me ♪ ♪ Baby trust me ♪ ♪ Baby trust me ♪ ♪ Baby, I know you, you, you ♪ ♪ And you are ♪ ♪ So very special to me ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ So special to me ♪ ♪ You are, you are ♪ ♪ You, you, you, you ♪ ♪ And you are ♪ ♪ So very special to me ♪ ♪ So special to me ♪ ♪ And you are, you are ♪ ♪ Push that body on me, baby ♪ ♪ I love it ♪
