No, stop! Wait! - Are you alright? - It's fine. Are you okay? Are you okay? How are you? Hey! No. Fine. EKSTRÖM & CO REAL ESTATE - Hi. - Hi. Magnusson. My parents live up at the crossroads. - Have you been seeing wild boars too? - Yeah, see for yourself. Yeah, it's only hours ago. They've been rooting all over. I'm heading out tonight to see if I can shoot some. - Can I search on your property? - You're more than welcome to. Thanks. Could you text me if you see any? I'll text you. What's your number? It's 0768-86-50-93. Thomas Moberg. Great. - Does that work? - I don't know. They sell wild boar fencing at the hardware store. An electric wire, about this high. - They work well. Alright, bye. - Thanks, bye. In the South to start with a bit cloudy with local showers, but mainly sunny. - You're wet. - Mhm. Not now, I need to do this. Is that your diary? Is it about me? - Can I read? - It's a list of the things I want. Then he can keep the rest, I don't want to argue. No. Please. Hey... Are you feeling guilty? About me? Liz... Bang! Nervous? - Shouldn't I come with you? - Over my dead body. What if he gets angry like last time? I don't want him or anyone else to see us together. - Why don't you go get some lunch? - It's half past nine. Have a walk before you eat then. I can't make plans for you as well. Hey. The buyers will be here at 1 pm and I will have finished loading by then. Signing the contract might take half an hour. So I'll pick you up around two. - I think about you all the time. - Yes, and I think about you all the time. - Now get out. - Okay. I'll call you when I'm on my way. Bye bye. Byesie-bye. Come and stand here beside me Put your hand on my cheek Take a step closer to me Breathe out, breathe in See me the way only you do With your skin against mine Forget all doubts and all that's done Tonight I am yours - What's all this? - Sorry. - Is it supposed to be funny? - The trap is not for you, darling. - I'm not your "darling" anymore. - I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm sorry. It's for the wild boars. They're back. - There. - Stop laughing at me. I thought they killed them all off a few months back? Do you think I brought in some more just to mess with you? We can't leave it like this for the buyers. They won't sign if they know about the boars. Calm down. I'll take the traps down in good time. They won't be here until three. - You said one. - You must have heard one. I said three. But I've made plans to be done by one. What will I do for two hours? You managed for 20 years. What's a few more hours then? I've got 500 miles to drive and I hate driving in the dark. Welcome. I'd appreciate if we can keep things this civilized. I wanted to be your future How could it all go so wrong? - Are you expecting someone? - I just made us some fish soup. Please don't say "us". - We've got to eat anyway. - Don't say "we". There is no more "we". Well, I've got to eat, and maybe you too. No, thanks. I have to pack. Nice. - Well done. - Thank you. I'd buy a house like this. I'll sign when the buyers get here and then I'll leave. Do you have to play this album? Sunrise over Tobago Café au lait in Paris More coffee? Do you work for the press? I know everyone here if you need... Thanks, that's enough. Yes. I thought he said one. I know, but I can't do anything about it now. Take it easy. No, there's nothing going on between us. It's all fine. Yes, I'm just going to be two hours later. Don't call me here again. I've got to go, he's coming. Please, would you mind not rocking? Am I bothering you? Not to be rude, but... I'm not going to steal anything. What do you mean? I'll put stickers on the furniture I want and put the small things in a pile here. And I'll ask about everything before I pack it. What makes you say that? You seem to be watching me. No. I'm not watching you, I'm thinking. If you prefer I could go for a walk. - Thank you. I really appreciate it. - No problem. Let's keep things civilized. HOW IS IT GOING? ARE YOU ALMOST DONE? Birdwatcher? Sorry to startle you. - I don't know anything about birds. - Those are swans. They stay together for life. It's sweet. Most other animals look for a new partner every year for mating season. Not swans. For them it's all about lifelong love. So you're not a birdwatcher. Are you a winter swimmer? Freezing. I'm just traveling through. - Are you a journalist? - No, a freelance photographer. - How free? - I've got to go. You seem really nice. Would you have dinner with me tonight? The harbor restaurant is open. - I won't be here tonight. - Shame. Bye. Bye. - Welcome back. - Thank you. WHAT HAPPENED? Days like these really make you miss the summer. - How's it going? - I'm practically done. Do you want to have a look? Do you want any of this stuff? Just tell me. It's totally fine if you do. I bet there was no one at the beach now. What makes you think I went to the beach? You love walking by the sea. No one knows me better than you. Yeah, there wasn't anyone swimming exactly. I only saw one other person. A good looking female photographer. I tried to ask her out to dinner tonight. As a consolation when you leave. Maybe that one. No, you have it. - If you really want it... - No. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Koh Lanta, New Year's 2013. We fucked on the beach every night for ten days. Nah. It only makes me sentimental. And let's not get sentimental. No emotions. Civilized. Some choices are made because there are no other options left. It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Why didn't you tell me what you felt while we still had options? Why didn't you let me in? How long were you pretending? - Who is he? - Don't start again. There's no other man. They'll be here in an hour now. In what order do you want to load? Are you lifting and packing in those clothes? I can lend you some clothes. You'd like that wouldn't you? Thanks but no thanks. What did she say about dinner tonight? The photographer on the beach? That's between her and me, you know. We're not together anymore, we don't share private stuff. They're heavier on the way out than on the way in. Thank you for helping me. I'll grab the smaller things myself. I'll pop them in the car. Okay. When are you moving? I've emptied upstairs and rented a storage space in Simrishamn. The buyers are staying in town this weekend and on Monday morning I've got a moving van coming for the rest. - Let me get rid of the wild boar trap. - Yes. Yes, Thomas speaking. Sorry, the reception is a bit bad here. Let me move a bit. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? That's better. Hello. Oh. Have they not even taken off? I see. So it might not be until tonight? Give me a call when you know more. Bye. - You're not saying... - I don't run the airport. The cabin door won't close. They don't have spares in London so they're bringing one from New York. Don't they have more aircraft? Do you want to call the broker or the airline yourself? Don't be silly. I'll have to drive in the dark all night up to Stockholm. You're welcome to stay here. No, thank you. Thomas? - Thomas? - Yes, darling. I'm going to the gas station. Then I'm going for a walk. Do you want me to come, darling? I'm so pleased it's all done. I'm sorry. Was it hard? No one can see us together. Get in quick. Why didn't you just take your stuff and say "thank you, bye"? - I need to sign the contract. - Can't you do it online? That's not how it works with houses. All vendors and buyers have to be physically present. They need to sign and send their copies at the same time. I see, this must be the stone age. Don't they have more aircraft in London? I don't run the airport. Do you want to call the airline? I'm sorry. I can smell hot dogs. I'm starving. Hey. We could go out for dinner at the harbor restaurant while you wait. Sorry, we can't be seen together. Why don't you go? Get me a takeaway for when I pick you up. Okay. I love you. I fucking love you. Don't ever leave me. Promise. No. No! Thomas! - Calm down. What's going on? - They're outside. - That's good. So the plane did take off. - The wild boars. Oh dear. It's alright. It's alright. Thanks, that's enough now. Jesus Christ. I've lit a fire. Take a seat and I'll get some wine. What if the wild boars come when the buyers are here? I can fire some shots before. Have you bought a rifle? You of all people? I just open the door and go "bang, bang". I see. And do they care? It makes no difference to them. I did that last night when I saw them and they left straight away. Jesus, what am I doing? I'm driving later. Don't worry about it. The plans have changed. It's too late. The broker called and said they're staying the night in Copenhagen. - That doesn't work. - What's the big catastrophe? You hate driving in the dark. Of course you can stay the night here. You've emptied the spare rooms. We've shared a bed for 20 years. Yes, when we were a couple. I'm sure there's some place in town with rooms available. The problem is getting a taxi at this time. - How much have you had to drink? - No way. I'm not going to risk my license. But if you want to walk down I can pick you up tomorrow. I'm not going out there. - I'll sleep on the couch. - It will ruin your neck for tomorrow. Can I have some more wine, please? Excuse me, I just need to go to the bathroom. Here we are. My dear friends... Finally! Are you on your way? What is the absolute essence of love? What do you mean? I think it's trusting the other person. I don't have a choice. We can stay where we stayed last night. Don't behave like a child. I've told you a million times that Thomas would go mad if he knew about us. He would block the sale. This is really hard for me. Are you going to sleep with him? No, I'll sleep on the couch in the living room. He's in the bedroom. But it also holds a terrible danger. We all know what that is. I'll call you when I can. Kiss. Congratulations. Here's to love and to trust. Cheers. - Would you like something to eat? - Yes, a double whiskey as a starter. Any main course? Another double, please. This feels just like old times. Just like old times. Are we talking about the same thing? You're so good at venison. This is delicious. How about wild boar? Is that tasty? When exactly did you decide that you were leaving me? Please... How long were you with me without being with me? I tried to stay. I tried. I really did. I thought that it would pass, so I didn't want to cause problems. To avoid... And then... Bang! Without a warning. It wasn't kind. You must have understood before. No. There was nothing you could do anyway. How can you be so sure? Because it's not about you, it's about me. What is? Don't pretend to be less sensitive than you are. How long has it been since we had sex? Yeah, but... Those sort of things are on and off in all people's love lives. Sometimes we have to wait for each other. For seven months? I felt anxious every night when we went to bed. - Anxious? You? - Yes. And all the while we were doing lots of fun stuff. - We've traveled and... - I did enjoy the daytime. Of course. The anxiety was about going to bed together and you... touching me. I'm sorry. But you keep asking... You're making me say it. We've been together for 20 years. - Many of them good. - We have two children. We could have had more if you had wanted. Two is enough. It's normal. They've got their lives and they're well. This is the way it is now. We've got everything. That's how you see it. And how do you see it? You've been great at making a life for yourself. A life for us. I let you do it. What's missing for you? Me. I'm more like a decorative feature. You say that after 20 years? I suppose it took me that long to figure that out. What do you want? Wow, I think that's the first time you ever ask me. I want happiness. I want the unexpected. And desire. I want desire. I can change. No, it wouldn't make a difference. What do you know that I don't know? Can't we keep this last evening as a dignified memory? Tobago Café au lait in Paris Forget all doubts and all that's done May I have this dance? What do you mean? Do you want to dance? I wanted to be your future How could it all go so wrong? I hear a voice deep inside me It prays... We've both got our reasons why But this is our last goodbye In Berlin, it was fall and it was us You got sick from the seafood And dry, ice-cold wine In New York, the big breakfast table We got the train to a beach Held each other tight And remember what I said This is too good It's better than I thought life could be Somewhere we still exist We've both got our reasons why But this is our last goodbye - Thank you. That was nice. - Thank you. - Can I borrow some sheets and a blanket? - Of course. Everything here is still just as much yours. FOR MARIE Oops. Are you okay? Do you need help? - It's totally fine. - Five steps. One, two, three. - There. - I'm fine, I promise. - Take care. - I will. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. Bye. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW? - Sleep well. - You too. Hey! Hey. Excuse me, could you give me a lift to a place not too far away? It's just... - It's very close. - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - No problem, just get in. FOR MARIE Dearest Marie. How did this all happen? I'm alone in our summer house and I have just read your last text. It's not your fault that you discovered after 20 years you don't love me anymore. And it's not the feelings you lack that hurt me the most. What hurts most is how long and how convincingly you've acted in love. That you kept it all to yourself. You said "I've done my best." No, Marie. On the contrary you've done everything to get the best outcome for yourself when you've finished with your own thoughts. Just in case you do decide that I am the one for you after all. You have closed yourself off to the power contained in companionship. When a life is made together. I know I'm quoting my own latest book, but never mind that. It's still true. I just wish that you could have done this with me. As for me, I have no reason to live now. But thank you for the beautiful times. Good luck. Love, Thomas. PS. Sorry for taking your old backpack. Yes? Am I disturbing you? Can't you sleep? Can I sit with you for a bit? - What are you reading? - A colleague. Russ Harris. "The Happiness Trap". Make your own happiness. This isn't easy for me either. I can see that I was difficult to read. I never meant to hurt you. I really did do my best. But perhaps that wasn't so good. I'm sorry about that. It hurts me that you're hurt. Where did you find that? Under the sofa table. Thomas. - There we go. No problem. - Thank you. - Have you got everything? - Yeah. Alright. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Bye. - Bye. I wish more than anything that we'll be friends for life. Maybe a loving friendship could be more real for us, than that other love. Can't we try again? - I really do like you as a person. - I know. Bang! I'm sorry, I'm lost. The road is that way. 30 yards. - But it's you! - Who? - The woman from the beach. - I see. The photographer. I thought you were leaving. Yes. I... I missed the bus and thought I would walk. Did you walk all the way here in the dark? That's really dangerous. - There are wild boars. - It's not dangerous. Not dangerous at all. The road is that way. I'll call a taxi. Then we could have had dinner after all. Seven minutes. Thank you. Pardon? Seven o'clock? Seven o'clock in the morning? Yes, but that's completely unreasonable. You must have more than one car? No, I suppose that's impossible. Goodbye. Neither of us can drive tonight. Should we ask the young lady in for a cup of tea while we think? Thank you. Why the hell did you come here? At least I got to see it with my own eyes. - See what? - You two. You kissed him! - We had one last dignified conversation. - Copulation. - Where did you get that idea? - Fuck you! - Fuck you. Fuck... - Does anyone take milk? - You know I don't take milk. - Yes, please. Thanks for asking. There we are, ladies. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Liz. - Nice. - Thomas. Pleasure to meet you. - Don't I get any tea? I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry. I call her "darling" out of habit. We've been married, and technically I suppose we still are. We're somewhere in between now. But soon I'll be single again. Have you introduced yourselves? Somewhat. So, this is Marie, my ex wife. And this is the lady from the beach, Liz. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. Dang it, I forgot the milk. Excuse me. THEY ARE HERE NOW! I shoot for different magazines. Mostly internationally. Anything from portraits to war. How fascinating. - What about you? - I'm a crisis therapist. - What kind of crises? - Well, no wars. Apart from that a bit of everything. From death and acute grief, to depersonalisation disorders and divorce. - How do you stand it? - Well... Somehow many conversations about death give me a desire to live. And how about divorce? - More tea? - Yes, please. Look, is that the taxi after all? - Hi there. - Where did you see them? I saw them on the other side of the cars. - But they were on the other side too... - What's going on? Don't scare them off. My wife spotted them. My ex wife. You tell him. Magnusson is here to shoot the boars. Good evening, Magnusson. I'm Marie. I wonder if you would mind giving this lady a lift to a B&B first? No, no, no! Then the boars might leave. Isn't that right, Magnusson? Don't worry about me. It's... Do you mind if I sit on the terrace? I'll have a good view from there. - How about a coffee or tea? - I've got everything I need. Best of luck. Get out of here now. Okay? Oops. And on the floor as well. I'm sorry. Don't worry about that. But it's a shame about your nice blouse. Wait, I have a miracle solution. Multi Magic, works for everything. Just take it off and chuck it in to me. I promise not to look. Dear lord, what are you doing? Put this on. You're so sweet. Here it is. It gets all stains out. - Do you need to rub it for a long time? - That's probably enough. Then we leave it to work for a while, and then into the washing machine. Do you want to borrow this? You don't understand the consequences of what you're doing now. Cut it out. Keep your jacket on. - Why are you acting so phony with her? - What do you mean? I'm just trying to be friendly. Why so sensitive? We're not together anymore. You have a new life now. But if you want revenge, can you please wait until I leave? It's distasteful. I prefer men's clothes to women's. It suits you. Doesn't it? It's much more comfortable. More sensual... Fucking hell. That's big. I've seen bigger. There's lots of them out there. But now we're alright for tonight at least, aren't we? It's just the beginning. I injured two of them that are out there in the dark somewhere. They're watching us. The herd is plotting their revenge. They've got us surrounded, so go inside and stay there. Are you serious? They're like elite soldiers. Tough and disciplined. Sharp minds. But I'm smarter. I will exterminate them. - Make sure you lock it. - Yeah, yeah. They're not that smart. I love encounters with wilderness. There's something... Why don't you take a walk back then? I think she meant more a sense of life, than a practical solution. Didn't you? - You're unusually sensitive for a man. - Thank you. - Excuse me, I feel a bit sick. - Oh no. I have Samarin antacid. It works for all kinds of nausea. What the hell are you doing? Do you want to ruin the sale? Maybe I will. He's not at all like you said. I understand why you wanted him. We never fucked. Samarin has outlasted all eras and fashions. I remember when I had it the first time. I was a kid and had eaten to much cake. It does to the inside what Multi Magic does to the outside. Here you are. You don't have a drink to offer? An alcoholic one? I need to warm up. - Red wine? - Do you have whiskey? No, sorry. - A large glass then, please. - I'll get it. Don't you think it's time we went to bed? - We? - I don't see any other option. Liz... That was your name, wasn't it? You take the sofa, and I'll put a mattress in the spare room. I'll sort it out. You go to bed. - Here you are. - Thanking you. - There. Goodnight. - I want a kiss goodnight. A kiss? A kissy-kiss. You don't deserve it. This is insane. - You can sleep here if you want. - No, thank you. Okay. You need to sleep before you drive tomorrow. I'll take the spare room. - You can take your own sheets. - Wow. I'm just trying to be nice and civilized. But you treat me like I've got the plague. Sleep well, Marie, if you are able to. Goodnight. ARE YOU AWAKE? Can I have some water too? Of course. My mouth is so dry. Cold. Ice cold. Is it the moonlight making us thirsty? I've had the fire on all night, so the air is dry. Goodnight. Hey... - This isn't a good idea. - She doesn't want you anyway. She's found someone else. Yeah, come on. Huh? Full moon. - Are you thirsty too? - The fire makes the air so dry. Thank you. That's sweet of you. Now I need to try to get some sleep. Damned full moon. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Sorry. Are they still here? What is happening? It's a war. It's a waiting game. They will attack. Don't they see that? Yes, sure. That's why I've hung it there. Revenge is stronger than fear. These bastards got my wife last summer. How? Well... She was out picking mushrooms alone and... - Do you want more detail? - No. No. Ah, coffee. Morning. I love the smell of coffee in the morning. I know. That's one thing we still share. Where is she? Was her name Liz? She's talking to him out there. Is he still here? As long as the wild boars are still here... Here you are. It's still dripping. Oh damn. I can never wait until it's done. I know. It's so foggy. Did you speak to her yesterday? Did you tell her you'd met another man? What? Why would you say that? I thought she said that. Or another woman perhaps. When did she say that? Last night in bed... you said you wished more than anything that we would be friends for life. I'd love that. And trust each other. - A loving friendship. - Yes. The best love proof you can give me right now is to be completely honest with me. I am being honest. So you haven't met another man? Or woman? No, Thomas. No. Good morning. The hunter is still out there. So are the wild boars. We're not allowed out. It can't go on like this when the buyers are coming. No, but I'm not the boss of the wild boars. Isn't there someone we can call? We've already got a hunter out there. Let's get a team out. At 7 am on a Sunday? Good luck. What about the police? We both know the nearest police station is an hour away, if they even answer. But we have to do something. I suppose I can call. Could you take him some coffee? What? Absolutely not. We'll get to your call as soon as possible. You are number 16 in the call queue. - This is absurd. - I agree. The wild boars killed his wife last summer. I suppose that's why he's so determined. What do you mean? Revenge. That's what he said. Revenge is stronger than fear. I understand him. Do you? It can do a lot to a person... when someone takes away the thing he loves the most. It's a profoundly human feeling. But to actually take revenge is sick. I really do love your carrot marmalade. My God! - Bang! - Stop it. Shut the door. - He's going to die. - Do something! What do you want me to do? What the hell are you doing? What the fuck are you doing, you idiot? You are number 11 in the call queue. We were in the house, but we heard two shots. I don't know if he wounded any. We'll call another hunter who will try to get the animal. Sounds good. - Do you need anything before we leave? - No. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Take care. - Thank you. Can you please get a move on? Help me. The buyers will be here any minute. You're fucking cold as ice. Have you already sold the pictures? Can you please just leave me alone? If you ruin the sale with your pictures, it's over between us. Isn't it already? Fucking hell, right? This is just the beginning. Yes. Yes, we're going to have to live with this for a long time. So many nightmares. Can you please for once stop with all this bullshit? Turn it off. What is it? Hey, Thomas? It's for you. Where did you get this? From one of our best friends. It's on the internet. Since when? I got it six months ago. Six months? But you'd been together since she did that shoot with you in London. The cover for Business Weekly. She moved into your room in Mayfair two days later. You. Turn around and walk away from here. Now. They might still be hungry. But I thought you loved encounters with wilderness. Walk or I'll shoot. Thomas. Shut up. You've got five seconds to get out of here. Four... three... two... one... No one has ever hurt me like you. How many times did I ask you to be honest? I understand that you're disappointed... You had my complete trust. You're full of shit. Lying through your teeth. I was going to tell you but I was scared of you. Scared of what? Of something like this. Then it was too late and impossible to say anything. Thomas, can I ask you something? When are the buyers coming? I thought you might try that one. The great negotiation move of the business woman: time pressure. Milady... There is no buyer. There is no broker either. There never was. Why did you want me here then? To give us one last chance. Honesty, reconciliation, forgiveness... What an idiot I was! I'm sorry. From the bottom of my heart. Please! No! No! No! Thomas? Thomas? Hey. Let's make it simple. You get the apartment, I get the house. Okay. Thomas. I do wish I had handled this differently. Drive safely. There are lots of boars along the road. I'll text you when I get there as usual, so you know. As usual, so I know.
