Let's see, guys... ...now that you're leaving school... ...what will you study? Law. Psychology. Industrial engineering. Me too, engineering. Administration. Early childhood studies. That's my girl. Graphic design. Music. Music. Music. Music too. We're living the worst times in Peruvian history... ...and you want to make music. And what kind of music? Rock, sir. There's no space for rock. It's expensive... ...the equipment, the instruments... ...to make a show. And your parents will surely not approve of it. You'll starve to death, dumbasses. And how do you know that? Because I used to have a rock band. "I don't give a shit... ...for today's lesson. Math, religion, Roll calls or singing an anthem to God. And respecting the teacher. I won't come back to school, no way. Let them keep all their crap. I won't come back to school, no way. What for? From preschool, school or college. Always the same oppression. I won't come back to school, no way. Let them keep all their crap. I won't come back to school, no way. What for? What for? What for? What for? What for? If I do know... ...a lot. What for? If I say... ...no, no, no. What for? It's useless. For nothing. For nothing. BASED ON THE PLAY "AV, LARCO, EL MUSICAL" A memory cannot be fragile. They'll do it, come hell or high water. 5 YEARS LATER. Professor. -You still have 30 minutes, Dulude. -No use, it'll be the same. I did so badly. I didn't take it. I was caught cheating. You've always sucked at cheating. Look. Wrong subject though. "So much effort to pass that admission test... ...how many years deciding on a major. Your freshman year was exciting. In five years, dark circles and no luck. I analyze the environment and it's insane. The PhD has failed, I feel out of focus. Failed in life for mala praxis. And now all I can do is drive a taxi around Lima. You can't manage to find a job... ...it's useless to be a professional. Things have gone wrong with me. This university drives me insane. This university is driving me insane. The chicks and parties have made me crazy. It's insane. It's insane. Insane, insane. One, two, three, go. Dirty, green cop You act in your best interest Dirty, green cop... What are you doing? What's wrong, Miki? OK, sorry. My bad. Will you say that at the concert? What's wrong, Wilbert? -Who's Wilbert, moron? -Are you not Wilbert? Ok, Wicho, sorry. Cut it out. We need to do it well before the contest. We haven't done it well in three weeks. We need to grow a pair, guys. We will make it. Time for a break, buddy. What? Come one! We must get another drummer, right? I'll never forget you, Miki. I love you, your Negra. Do you still have that chick in your mind? She's my lucky charm. Unlucky charm, maybe. You were with her... when you were like 10 years old... ...you haven't been with a chick again. So he's always horny. Look at me, I got a very hot chick. If I were to be your chick, you'd first need to be a real man. -You'd need guts for that. -Balls, more like it!! At least Wicho has a real girlfriend. Nobody knows your Susanita. We still have two hours... Hey, I heard the other bands are kicking ass. Let's go! One, two, three, now! "Dirty, green cop, you act in your best interest. Dirty, green cop, you defend decadence. A blackout? A major one. -That's Miraflores, isn't it? -I bet it is. I hope it is, or the contest is fucked. What contest? To play at Acho. When is that? In two hours. Forget it. You're out of the contest. -Why? -Because we're in a fucking war. Look. Come on, get in the house. -What's wrong, dad? -You could be hit by a stray bullet. Come on, come on, move! Andrés... ...I must go take care of those bastards. Your mother is at grandma's. I told her to stay there. You're in charge of the house. And nobody's going anywhere, get it? -Get it? -We'll stay here, sir. It seems like you're the only smart one here.. Do the rest of you understand? Yes, yes. Andrés? We've been rehearsing for two months, dad. We won't be long at the contest. Forget about the contest. Nobody's leaving the house. It's an order, get it? Can I trust you? I need to make sure. No, no, no. See? The power's back on in Miraflores. Will we stay here and do nothing? I don't have my guitar anyway. Easy, I'll take care of that. Andrés, are you nuts? Your dad will kill you. He just won't know. -And the guards at the gate? -Yes, and the guards? Do you think they won't tell your dad? Wait, wait, they will if they notice... ...but, if they don't notice. I'm telling you I'm not coming out. "A light reflected the model staring at nothing. It's a bloody Friday there'll be action here soon. Hunters are coming and going looking for their preys in the city. Roaring engines in a storm are coming to Larco to protest. Because it's a bloody Friday they've left their homes they're looking for girls and they're a bit too wasted. And the preys are also coming they know what they have to show. A fashionable skirt, tight jeans they're coming from everywhere. They enter the night they rock in the parties they get in the car and they're ready for everything. Some of them fail some others are shy and then they decide the river is no longer flowing. They're always smiling and even blush and when they get asked they get off the car quickly. What happened? I thought you weren't coming. We nearly missed it. You guys are next. Play really well! You're the last ones, the jury is tired... ...and the competition is strong. Do you have a guitar I can borrow? Really? Mine's broken. No, I don't. Besides, I can't help any band. You'll have to come up like that. Listen: in five minutes, OK? What now? I'll get it. Hey, bro, what's up? Wow, do you like Sumo? You know them? - Cool! Great band! - Yeah, great band! Listen, bro: we need a guitar for my band. Could we borrow yours? -We're competing, aren't we? -But we're both going to the finals! How do you know? You've never listened to my music. You look like a good player. Buddy, two beers. No, I want rum. The beers are for me. Good luck. We may have no guitar, but we have beer, don't we? Here. Now, give me the beer. Ok, guys, we're here. Together, with a guitar, no more excuses. -That goes for you, Miki, count well. -Easy, man. Wicho: attitude. You may say Wicho is irresponsible, or jealous, or damn ugly... ...but you can't say he has no attitude. Listen up, everyone! Before listening to the last band I want to thank the jury, who has the hard task of choosing the bands that will go to the semifinal. Let's hear it for them! Don't forget that the semifinal will be this weekend! Be quiet. The five classifying bands will compete for the title of new best rock band... at Plaza de Acho! What? Andrés, I'm not going to Plaza de Acho. Now, I'll leave you with "Kissmyass"! "Dirty, green cop you act in your best interest. Dirty, green cop you defend decadence. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Honor isn't your currency your currency is corruption. You abuse your authority as... ...you hold a gun in your other hand. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Dirty cop, dirty cop. Fucking great, guys! Great! You like that dumbass, huh? -What's with you? -You like him or not? -What the hell? -You think I'm an idiot? Hey, don't push it, OK? -I was helping you. -Oh, you were helping me. If you're nervous, have a drink, OK? -Beer? -Please, nice beer come to me. Congratulations, honey. -You didn't like it? -I liked it... fine. -I don't like this place. -Why? It's full of weirdos... -I like the Grill much better. -I like this place much better. Hey! It was great, huh? Hey, guys... ...this is Pedro. He lent us his guitar. Pedro, you saved us. You rocked, guys! -Did you really like it? -Of course. Here's a demo of our band. Oh, that's cool! Thanks guys, you rock. Listen up, guys. Here are the 10 semifinalists. Five Miles, Zender, Catharsis, Hypnosis, Confusion, Four Revolutions, Pedro Zuriaga and Kissmyass. Don't forget, bastards, see you at the Den of El Agustino. And where's that? In El Agustino. A classic spot. Yeah right, in El Agustino. And? You're not going, are you? -No, we're here for no reason. -Lola... That place's full of terrorists! I live in El Agustino. And I don't know anyone who's a terrorist. Listen up, guys. Curfew starts in just one hour. Those willing to stay till curfew is over... -Do we stay till curfew is over? -No, Andrés, let's go. -Nooo, we should stay to celebrate. -You guys stay. I'm leaving. Go with her, honey. You should go together. -Hey, where's Javi? -Get some beers. He's coming. "The early morning starts to light up. The end of the party is getting closer. Desert streets, loneliness. White bottles now empty. Where's everybody gone? Where's the noise gone? Where are the girls? Where are the hunters? Where are they? Where's the night? Where's the harmony? Where's the noise gone? They feed the streets of Larco on bloody Fridays, where, where are they? -Where the hell were you? -Don't ask if you know. Damn it! You've scared your mother so much. Sorry, dad. If your dad were here... ...you wouldn't do this. -I don't give a fuck about your music. -But I do. -It's all that really matters to me. -What about your studies? I got into college for you. -So that you could leave me alone. -You're screwing it up, Andrés. You're not only studying a shitty major. But you're also brazenly skipping school. You suck at your exams and you spend the day smoaking pot. Are you spying on me too? How do you think I make a living, dumbass? I know everything. "Now that you know how I feel and how hard it was to tell you. Things at the university didn't go well. I'm not cut out to be a doctor. Music is what I like. I want to be a drummer, a rocker. I have a band that plays really well. I will play at a full coliseum. Will you help me? -Answer me. -No, no, no. Answer me. You must do it now. -Answer me. -No, no, no. Answer me. You must do it now. -Answer me -No, no, no. Answer me. Answer me. Now. Now. Now." So you want an answer? Let go of my guitar. I hardly know you anymore. Damn, Miki! What happened yesterday? Your mom called mine. She was very upset. I ran away, buddy. My dad went totally berserk. Your dad's crazy... You're not going back? No. And where will you sleep? Here? I don't know. Don't be a pain. Me a pain? Think of your mom! Hi. Where have you been? -Really? -Yes, really. Wicho, don't be silly. Look. What's that? The Ramones' Animal boy. -How did you get it? -Pedro lent it to me. He's your buddy, huh? So how come? He got it from a friend of his who lived in Los Angeles. She's back in Peru now. He says she's brought a lot of tapes for sale. La Negra Records? La Negra Records? That's your Negra. No, impossible. -No. -Yes. -She's in Lima. -She can't be here. Ten years thinking about her and you don't want to see her? -She's the love of your life. -It's been a long time, OK? She must be ugly now, with a face like a pizza. And a voice like a street vendor: "Avocado, for one Sol No, no, it can't be her. She can't be here. Hi guys, what's up. This is my friend, La Negra. Miki? Negra? "After a long time I ran into her again she was as pretty as the stars. She had grown more than I thought. Hi, how are you doing? You have a nice body, let's go for ride. I was fascinated to see her walk. My childhood memories came back when she was pretty on the sidewalk. Playing with her dolls, feeding them Hi, I said, do you want to play? I'm the best doctor in the city. She said: if you kiss me, I'll play. We used to see each other then naughty nights under the staircase. We were wicked, we felt good now we need to refresh all those things very mildly.. I grabbed her hand and started to kiss her. And this happens, when a girl is sexy you can feel the eruption of a delusional volcano. If you kiss her well she can lose control, she forgets her place. After a while, I ran into her again she was pretty and I took her out for a ride. These are Andrés and Lola. Nobody should see my password. RamÃ³n? Rapid money, buddy. Never seen that. It's the first one. Can Ramon lend me money? You? In 30 more years. â€œSeveral pylons have just been blown down by the terrorist group Shining Path, which has left Lima in complete darkness. KISSMYASS Hey, you look mad. Where's Marité? They told me she left home a while ago. "I'm bitter, I don't like the way you are I'm sick of always seeing you flirting with others. I can't stand the way you smoke and the noise you make when you're chewing gum I don't like it when you're grinning for no reason and you start to dance, trying to tease, you are nuts. You are always pretending I'm your private property. Worst of all, of being with you is that I love you, is that I love you. Worst of all, of being with you is that I love you, is that I love you. Aren't you coming to see us play? I'm off to the Grill. -It's Lara's birthday. -Yes, but it's the final. Today we'll know if we're playing at Acho. I've always followed you everywhere. I've seen you play a thousand times. We go to the bars where you and your friends want to go. Besides... ...every time I'm with you guys I feel like a nuisance. Every time I open my mouth I'm the stupid, shallow girl... No, no, no, Lola, I've never said that. You don't have to say it... I just feel it. I love you so much. But we're way too different. We're growing apart. Do you want to break up? No, no, Lola... ...honey. We can work it out. -If you need more time... -I don't need more time. We've wasted enough time, right? "Saying goodbye was hard for me. I've loved you since we met. I'm here thinking about you and your memories are everything to me. It's hard to think you'll never be back. I didn't want to break up but I have to accept it. The truth is that I feel lonely and I won't be able to forget you. The truth is that I feel free although these are lonely nights. And the truth is that you're deep inside as you filled a place. And hopefully you won't be back as somebody else will take your place. As somebody else will take your place. Easy, buddy. We're here for you.

Do I look like I'm not alright? I don't know. I saw you here...alone. And when a woman is alone it's because she's not alright? No. Is this how you sweet talk a girl? -I'm not sweet talking you. -So, what are you doing? Wasting my time. -Do you have gum? -Yes. Hey, hey, Andrés, wait. I don't get it, man, are you a faggot? -No, not at all. -So, what the fuck was that? I don't know. -It's rather clear to me. -So, why are you asking? It's not your business. If this guy is messing with you, you should tell me.... Why? Will you beat the shit out of me? Your friend likes men, that's it. It's not the end of the world. Hey, Andrés... I don't get it, man. Please, don't tell Wicho or Miki. Are you alright? Do I look like I'm not alright? Yes. You didn't know about your buddy, did you? No. Well, now you'll finally get to know him well. I'd rather not know. I thought so. That â€œtear it down, tear it down was an act. You didn't mean it. -I did mean it. -Then, start changing... ...that little old mind-set of yours.

I don't do that shit. Yes, you do. You are crazy for me. I'm not your dad, Wicho. I won't leave you. Always. Every day. -But don't laugh at me. -No, I don't. I think it's cute that you've thought about me every day. -Well, you laughed at me before... -I've never laughed at you. -You don't remember. -No. In your mom's car. -When we kissed. -I never laughed at you. I got nervous and just laughed. Besides it was my first kiss. -Really? -Yes. It was mine too. It's just so bad to be laughed at in your first kiss, isn't it? I didn't laugh at you. Well, if that's what you want to think, go ahead. If they're really your friends, they won't say a thing. It sounds so easy for you to say. You were surely lucky that your friends didn't tell you to fuck off. My best friend ran to tell my parents before I could say a word. -I nearly got kicked out of my house. -You see? But I feel better now. Have you ever felt like this for a woman? So what? Can I buy you a beer? Yes, why not? You're not an idiot, you're hot... -Besides, I won't see you again. -Why do you think so?

I think we've made a mistake. We screwed it up. NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD I'm sorry, Mr. Dulude. RamÃ­rez, the keys! We've made a serious mistake. You must understand our job is to eradicate terrorists.

Out! "There goes a generation of migrating people who lived in a different world from their parents from their grandparents. They went to school with urban residents they mixed their customs. Andean-town nostalgia seeking for opportunity. Now the time has gone by now we're many more. We aren't LimeÃ±os by blood but we have their culture we weren't born in a province but that's our blood. Get out. I don't want to see you with my son, you get it? Lima changed a while ago. It's about time you get used to seeing us. Get out! This country is a fucking mess thanks to people like you.

Bring 20 more people tonight. Then we'll see if you deserve to be with us. No way. -Why not, bro? -What do we have to do with that march? Fuck politics... I'm not chanting slogans. But almost all our songs are about politics. Our songs? Andrés writes the lyrics. You go alone, buddy. Count me in, Andrés. Yes, count me in too. I don't get you, Miki. I don't get you, Miki? If you want to go, tell your buddy Pedro. Pedro is coming. Because he fights for his beliefs. What's the use of your protest music if you don't have the balls to back it up? Ok, OK, go play with your girlfriend, OK? You're a douche. Did we screw up? You'll end up going anyway, dude. Why didn't you say yes from the beginning? Why do you want to go to that protest so badly? Hi. Hi. Can we talk? Of course. Talk. In private? -Guys, a minute, please. -Sure, go ahead. I mean it. Come on, let's go. I miss you so much, Andrés. -I made a huge mistake. -No, you didn't. You were right. Besides... ...I've already found someone I can be myself with. You didn't waste your time, huh?

Wicho. -What the hell's with you? -With me? The concert is fucked now. -Is this our fault? -No, it's my fault. Hey, Wicho, come back. Don't be a pussy. I'm a pussy. -Why are you leaving? -Am I a pussy? -Can you calm down? -You're the pussy here. What? Will you deny it? -Deny what? -That you and Pedro...you know... -What did Andrés tell you? -He didn't say anything. -Deal with it, now! -I have no shit to deal with! Stop fucking lying! Can't you see I'm here? Or you want me to leave? Easy, they're such idiots. You're cute! "A light reflected the model's staring at nothing. It's a bloody Friday there'll be action here soon. Hi. Can you help us? Dad, stop the noise, please. Negra... ...I want to dedicate this song to you because we're a bit on the outs. But... ...it won't be for long. Because we don't fight, really. Wicho and Marité fight all the time. Besides Andrés gave me a great idea. So this song goes for you. Wait. Sandoval. Hi. Mrs. Gladys. There's something you should know. -Where are you going, buddy? -None of your business. Sorry, we fucked up. Sorry. Yes, really. We don't mind that you're a faggot. You call me faggot again, I'll beat the shit out of you. Ok, sorry. The macho came out. Dude, come on, get real, we're apologizing. We've been best buddies forever. Forgive us. What do you want us to do? Want me to suck your dick? Ok, I'll suck it. Pull it out. I'll suck his. Hey, stop! You're such idiots. We are sorry... Are you still planning to play at Acho? Andrés asked me to play no matter what. Even if his dad keeps him locked up. We need to play, dude. We have to. But who will sing? We'd thought of Pedro. Could you ask him for us? I'd rather you guys tell him. But first let me ask you something. What? Suck it. Come on... Sorry. Where's Andrés? -You locked him up? -Won't you say â€œhi at least? I've let you rule in this house for too long. I'm doing it for his own good, don't you realize? Take me to the police station right now. Or you rather I authorize his release instead of you? -Are you alright? -Yes. Your dad wants to talk to you. I'll wait for you outside. If I'd been told some years ago... ...your son... ...that boy that follows you everywhere like a shadow... ...one day will oppose you in everything... ...I wouldn't have believed it. You and I were inseparable. What happened? I'm no longer a kid, dad. I realized I didn't want to go against myself to please you. Shit. That was a real low blow. Yes. I should learn to punch straight in the face like you do. It hurts you that I'm against what you think and do. But it's easy for you to despise whatever I think or do. Andrés... ...there's a bomb threat tonight. And that concert you want to play at is a perfect target. Do you understand? I've already accepted that you'll be a musician. But I can't accept to have my only son die before I do. That's why I locked you up. To stop you and your friends from going to that concert. I promise. Alright. I'll let you out. But you need to promise that you won't go to play at the concert. Then you'd better lock me up again. For god's sake, listen! You could be killed. You fight for your country your way. And I fight for it in my way. "My soul to conquer you my heart to love you and my life to spend by your side. THE GREAT FINAL PLAZA DE ANCHO Everyone wants to get to the zenith no matter how, everyone will there to the zenith happiness. The poor is the rich, the rich is the king the king to the glory, the immortal glory resurrection start over again. We'll wear out many shoes to get there Yes, Peru!" Fucking great! What's up, guys. KISSMYASS Supposedly, this concert is to find the best band. But that's not what matters the most. What is important is that we'll be heard. We shouldn't be quiet facing this shit. This is the car bomb generation. In a Kiss-my-ass country! "You know what I mean the end is near it's our fate Made by politicians We don't need a pass or to stand aside or an idol or an example it's all in you. You can be a martyr a pig, a snake there's no script or stage. Death is on the streets it'll always be like this time is yours stay here. Long live the armed struggle! Andrés, Andrés! Miki! No! "Hi we meet... ...again. Tell me... ...do you have something to say? You see, time has healed the wounds of the past. Perhaps you might want to talk. You know, the world has no end. You arrive to leave again. Because we're immortal and we'll always be together we no longer fear death. MISSING SO IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN DEDICATED TO ALL PERUVIANS WHO UNFAIRLY DIED DURING THAT TIME.
