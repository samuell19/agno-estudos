How did Reger get the position of Hofkapellmeister in Meiningen? And who did he succeed as a conductor? Reger had already performed with members of the court orchestra. He said the only orchestra he really wanted to lead was the Meininger Hofkapelle. When the position was put out to tender lots of people applied, but Reger didn't. However he let it be known that he was interested. Reger's predecessor Fritz Steinbach was his great advocate. He recommended Reger to the Duke. The Duke was rather sceptical because Reger's reputation was so ambivalent. To some he was an upcoming composer... ...to others he was a "destroyer of music" while others saw him as a traditionalist. And they were all agreed that he drank to much. Steinbach had to dispel all these doubts... ...and maintain that Reger was the best for the court orchestra and for him. And finally he convinced the Duke. The Duke liked Reger from the start and called him a great original... ...and no mere courtier. Reger did not approve of the Duke because of his assumed "divine origin". He saw himself as an artist gifted by God and therefore the Duke's equal. As for family life... well, when was Reger at home? Reger's children did not attend a public school. Elsa herself was against it. Elsa herself blossomed in court life but Reger could not stand it at all. Here we have the orchestra schedule of one of the concert tours... ...of the Meininger Court Orchestra. And I see there were 22 concerts in 20 days. Is that true? That's right. The Meininger Court Orchestra did enjoy working with Reger in such an intense way. Reger on the other hand learned a lot through this concentrated daily intensive work. He also recognised what could be expected of the orchestra and what could be implemented. Above all, he had a strict orchestra discipline during both concerts and rehearsals. Through this approach he developed the famous "dreifache Meininger piano" (pianopianissimo). That means the orchestra really changed and developed under Reger's leadership. Yes, the general opinion was that the orchestra had stagnated a little before Reger took over. But I believe it was actually going in a different direction. Reger with his tendency to extremes... ...wanted to be able to hear a pin drop AND the music too! He gained considerable experience working day to day with the court orchestra. He therefore knew how to orchestrate the sounds he had in mind. In this respect it's a perfect song. I see "An die Hoffnung" as a preparation for the Romantic Suite. For me, both are night-time chants. Therefore "Tristan" comes into picture... ...and I think you can hear throughout that Reger from the outset was a great Wagnerian. Originally Reger wanted to compose a recitative and an aria. Karl Straube had suggested Friedrich Hölderlin's ode, "An die Hoffnung" (To Hope). In Reger's hands it developed into something a bit different to a recitative and an aria. As he often did, Reger altered the lyrics that he was adapting... ...to an extent that the sense of the poem was given a different direction. For example, in the Hölderlin poem it reads... "....there in the silence, sweet hope, I will LOOK for you." Reger changes this to, "...I will FIND you." A major difference. At the end of the poem he adds a whole line, "...oh hope, oh hope, sweet, sweet hope." As if he could not live with the suspended, unredeemed thought of life beyond death. I think this is amongst Reger's most personal vocal works. I always have the feeling that the poem found him, as it seems so close to the depth of his soul. To my mind, there is a certain meeting of souls between Böcklin and Reger... ...Reger´s ideal to live solely for his art is also expressed in the painting. But there are other relationships that have been neglected... ...namely the irony in Böcklin's work. Even though this has been forgotten. If you have a look at the Böcklin picture with its remarkable creatures frolicking in the water... ...it's actually really funny! That was the kind of humour Reger could also relate to! "Maria Wiegenlied" Opus 76/52, composed in 1912 in Berchtesgaden. "The most popular da capo lied in the concerts of the most famous female singers... ...More than 100,000 copies sold!" That was the slogan on the special advertising print of this lied. Already in Reger's lifetime this became his most famous lied. It was a hit. And why was that? It's the wonderfully deep and intimate melody that travels straight to the ear... ...and in its great chasteness is anything but simple. No other lied by Reger has been arranged for such a variety of instruments. Anyone who listens to a performance of Reger's unfinished requiem "Dies Irae"... ...or better "the abruptly discontinued" requiem... ...is changed somehow. What is "Dies Irae" all about? I actually attended the premiere. That took place at the end of the seventies... ...because up to then there hadn't been a musical score available. The performance was recorded on vinyl. It was reviewed by one critic who said tellingly... ...that he always had the feeling that the Great War had failed to leave its mark in the music. There wasn't anything like Remarque's book "All Quiet on the Western Front". What existed in literature, didn't exist in music. Now the critic was relieved because this piece appeared as world war in its purest form. And indeed, one is squashed against the wall and appalled. No other work of Reger is as expressive. It also leads into new areas of sound and composition... Such that one thinks, Reger old chap, couldn't you have continued with that... ...and not been dissuaded? Then that would have turned into something even greater." I think Straube had a very different taste concerning choir music. He simply couldn't follow Reger's modern musical language anymore. Even though he understood his organ works so well... ...which were also highly expressive. I don't accept that Reger was no match for the text. Reger was certainly Catholic enough to know his Latin texts quite well. Before he started, he consulted a cleric... ...who indeed translated the Requiem word by word for him. To me it also sounds rather literal... ...at least according to Reger's ideas... ...and not necessarily to others. He himself said, having moved to Jena, "Now Reger's free Jena style begins!" He was referring to a violin sonata, which he composed there... ...which also remained a fragment. After the Requiem he was not even able to finish a violin sonata. That's how depressive he was – it was a real creative crisis. But now came the move away from the town and court society. He couldn't deal with the court society which disgruntled and annoyed him many times. He was no court clerk. And now being in a city like Jena which championed a freedom of mind... ...since Schiller, at the latest! Exactly! He knew that the Republic of Letters was awaiting him. Since his breakthrough he had always been welcomed... ...especially by the academics. And those he found concentrated in Jena. This was the atmosphere of freedom of mind that he was hoping for... ...and of course the freedom of not being employed anymore... ...not being forced to fulfil the demands of others. He called himself "Freiherr Reger" (Baron Reger) – literally a freeman. Mostly he felt free to not have to fight at the sharp end of modernism anymore. He gave up on that. In 1910 Schoenberg wrote his first atonal pieces. Reger commented... "I'm not sure whether this is still music – it really makes one turn to conservatism!" So this was the freedom he was giving himself to go on in his compositions the Reger way. That meant to permanently improve, from work to work. In May of 1915, almost exactly one year before Reger died... ...he wrote this lied and dedicated it to his godchildren Hedwig and Max-Martin Stein. It is one of the "Fünf neue Kinderlieder" (Five New Children's Songs), Opus 142a. The letter "A" seems like a message to Gretel, the mother of Hedwig and Max-Martin Stein... ...as if to say, "Please, write many more poems!" Because it was Reger's plan to write another 50 children's songs... ...which was not meant to be. Stylistically these five Lieder are actually a continuation of the "Schlichte Weisen". The last of those five, "Bitte" is also Reger's last ever lied. Based on a poem of Adele Holst. On the outside it seems like a somewhat naïve or childlike prayer. But close to the end, the dimensions of the lied expand... ...so that the angels may "...gently guide someone on his path to God." Reger's first lied was a prayer, a hopeful, life-affirming one asking for happiness. His last lied has a typical Reger harmonic with a rather homeopathic dose. It asks for safe conduct into death. The ever-present death in war at that time... ...as well as his life-long sense of limited time may have had an internal effect. On May 11th 1916, Reger died at 43 years old. Had there been any premonition for him? It was long predicted but nevertheless terrible and surprising for everyone. On his bedside table they found... ...the corrections of his wonderful choir chant that he composed at the start of World War I... ...entitled, "Mankind Lives and Thrives Only a Short While". We have this proof sheet... ...and I always get goose bumps looking at it, realising how things fell into place. That almost seems staged but I am sure it wasn't! No, it's certainly true. It was witnessed by many people. Max Klinger made a drawing of him on his deathbed... ...and a famous photographer was present. It is all accurately documented. Why is Reger so important to you? I think he has an ingenious way of combining intellect with emotion. He mastered the craft and was able to evoke emotions... ...and for me this is a great combination. Reger never set up a school of music making even though he had 300 students. There are repeated generations who have taken on aspects of his work. He remains interesting and new generations can always find something important in his work... ...and that is a result of his complexity. Above all, I think that he will never be a composer for the masses. He's too intellectual for that. But there is always a certain group of people who are interested in his music... ...and above all, that's the performers. As I see it, Reger's future lies in the hands of those who are engaged with him. I can only speak as an interpreter. With a view to the overall development of the last decades one still has to say... "If the mountain won't come to the prophet, the prophet must come to the mountain." In other words, we have to listen to him time and time again. Only by listening to him more, can he no longer be overlooked.
