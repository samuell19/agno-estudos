Just slip one through the infield. - Slide. - You're out. Is Washington winning, dear? No. Those damn Yankees. Come on, Smokey. I can count on you. Casper Niles tried to fry an egg on the sidewalk in front of his drug store once. Good ol' Smokey. He got a hit. In Hannibal, they were always saying, "cool air was on its way from Canada." I certainly don't see any sign of it here. Do you? - Do you? - Do I what? See any sign of cool air? What? What you're blind. Ump, you're blind. See any sign of what, dear? Oh, never mind.

Honestly, Joe, you're gonna get yourself a heart attack if you keep this up. - Or at least ulcers. - Wham! Oh, Joe! Nah! My friend's sister and Doris, they like baseball. But they don't suffer so. Well, I'm going to bed. I've got the bridge club tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Yeah. Sure. I mean, goodnight. Uh, uh... goodnight, old girl. Wham! One long ball hitter. That's what we need. I'd sell my soul for one long ball hitter. - Good evening. - Who are you? - A man who agrees with you. - Agrees? One long ball hitter. That's what the team needs. You're right about that. You live around here? My name is Applegate. And I think we have something in common. A love of the national game. Oh, you bet. You bet. Care to sit down? Thank you. You don't like to see the Senators in seventh place? Well, they may pull together yet. I'm here to make you a proposition. Not only would you like to see Washington win a pennant, but your secret yearning all your life has been to be a baseball player yourself. I wasn't so bad in high school. Not so bad? They were scouting you for Kansas City. You still got your spiked shoes and your glove. They're up in your bedroom. Who told you? Would you like to be the greatest baseball player in all history? Big joke. No joke. You can be a great ball player. I can't even bend over and touch my toes. Try it. Just for laughs. What do ya know? With my help, a lot of things come easy. Oh, uh... do you smoke? Hey. How'd you pull that off? I'm handy with fire. Who are you? I am quite a famous character, Mr. Boyd. I have historical significance, too. "Cause I said so. Well, alright. If Meg's awake, alright. Listen, mister, I don't know what the gag is, but I... I mean, what's the idea? I... For heavens sake. Joe. My goodness, talkin' to yourself. So you finally flapped your lid. What are you doing out here talking to yourself, in the dark? Talking to who? That's a sign of old age, you know, Joe. Talking to yourself. Is anything the matter? No, I... I was just thinking about the game. Oh, we went to the game yesterday. It was ladies day. And I must say, the hot dogs out at the park aren't what they used to be. I had the poorest hot dog yesterday, I ever had. Is Meg still up? She went to bed, a while ago. Well, we'll see her at bridge club tomorrow. We just came from our ballet lesson. They couldn't see you. No, they couldn't. An amusing little stunt. It was all the rage in the middle ages. You mean, you really are... Can't believe it, huh? But, but that's crazy. It can't be. The world is full of crazy things. - Crazier every day. - Oh, gosh. What are you doing here? Great events spring forth great men, Joe. They arise from nowhere. They take command. That's history. What are you talking about? I have chosen you... The most dedicated partisan of the noble Washington Senators, to be the hero, who leads them out of the wilderness to the championship. The Senators are in seventh place. Your powerful bludgeon and sparkling play will inspire the team to greatness. We'll call you Hardy. Joe Hardy. You'll be 22 years old. They'll put a new wing on that baseball museum at Cooperstown dedicated to you. "The Hardy shrine.” What do you want me to do? Just leave everything to me. - But my job, my wife. - This is a big operation. You can't let things like that stand in the way. I just disappear, is that it? Very simple. What happens after I stop being a baseball player? Then where would I be? Well, now, of course that's fairly well known. - Yes, but I have... - After all... There's nothing unusual about it. How do you suppose some of these politicians around town got started? And parking lot owners? - But still what they say... - Look. I've got something to trade here. I'm offering you a chance to be what you've wanted to be all your life. In my business, we have what you call an escape clause. This is not a real estate deal. If I don't like it, I ought to be able to get out. - Get out? - I've got my wife to consider. Alright, alright. I don't wanna hear anymore about your wife. Wives, they cause me more trouble than the Methodist church. I'm trying to be understanding, but all this haggling... - No. I won't do it. - Alright. I'll give you a chance to get out. Oh, sure. In that case... On the 24th of September at midnight. I wouldn't do it, but I don't want to have those damn Yankees win. - You can say that again. - It's a deal. - It is? - Now the other hand. - That's all? - Sure. What do you expect to do, sign your name in blood or some phony stunt like that? Come on. The team needs you. Let's not waste any more time. I just got to leave a note. Sure. Right away. I'll get a taxi. ♪ Goodbye old girl ♪ my old girl ♪ when you awaken I'll be gone ♪ can't tell you where I go ♪ it isn't fair I know ♪ but trust in me and carry on ♪ goodbye old friend ♪ my old friend ♪ there's something I must let you know ♪ I haven't said it much ♪ I guess I've lost my touch ♪ but my old girl I love you so ♪ now I know it hasn't all been roses ♪ we've had squabblin' days when tears were brought about ♪ but in a moment or two we would Bill and Coo ♪ and never even knew what we fought about ♪ and now your Joe ♪ has to go ♪ but he'll come back to you again ♪ so sleep your sleep old girl ♪ our love will keep old girl ♪ till then.

Why couldn't you remember that last night? You could have cost us a big inning. It's not that I'm dumb, Benny. Oh. Nobody said anything about your being dumb... Exactly. It's just that when we play the Yankees, I kinda tense up. You know, I kinda lose my head. I figure what the heck's the use. Will you listen to this guy? Benny? Benny, there is somethin' different about 'em. What do you mean? Well, we don't make them same goofus when we're playin' Kansas City? That's what I'm talking about. Boys, I know you're not yellow. Smokey, you're crashin' the fences till you drive me crazy. Rocky, you played three games with a broken hand. It's just that your mental state is off in left field some place. Now listen to me.

That's my boys. Now tear 'em apart. Hello, Benny. I've often wondered what this team did to keep up its morale. We didn't invite the press this morning, Gloria. Ah, Benny, you're very foolish to have this prejudice against me just because I'm a woman. My paper gives you as much space as the others do. I only wondered why you got here so early. I came down to see the naked men. Could be. What will I say? Don't worry about a thing, Joe. I'll be right with you. But... but if you just explain how it all works. Suppose when you were young, you'd had this chance. - How would you feel? - Oh, boy. Ah, don't "oh, boy" me. You've got it. For free, practically. Just act the way you would if it was 25 years ago. Enjoy it, Joe. I do. Benny, my boss is very anxious to find out what some of your players think of the Yankees. I'll tell you something right now. My boys won't play dead for the yanks or any other club. Are you Mr. Van Buren, the Washington manager? Why make something out of the Yankees? They're a swell bunch of fellas and we... Oh, yes, they're very polite. And then they beat your brains out. Ah, the yanks are just another ball club as far as we're concerned. I read somewhere they're talking about handicapping the Yankees. Making them carry extra weight, like race horses. Yeah? So what's on your mind, Mac? Applegate is my name, uh... My card, sir. I'm busy. See my secretary. - Oh, Mr. Van Buren, um... I am a long time fan of the Washington Senators... Listen, Mac, I told you I'm busy. And, um, for some time now, I have been beating the bushes for talent. And, uh, this is my protege. Young Joe Hardy. Joe's quite a boy with a bat in his hands, and I'd like you to give him a trial. Where you been playin', son? Oh, um... here and there. - Where's here and there? Well, if you just give me a chance Mr. Van Buren, just let me hit a few. What have you got to lose? Smokey. He can hit the ball a country mile. - You want me, Benny? - Yeah. Take this boy down to the batting cage. Gee, thanks, Mr. Van Buren. And I certainly... Tell buster to throw him a few. Sure thing. Let's go, Mac. Just a minute. Where do you think you're going? Well, my protege may need my advice. Buster will give him all the advice he needs. If you want to watch, go out in the stands. The field is for ball players. You don't mind, do you? Love it, Mac. Just love it. Are you coming, my attractive friend? Well, I'll look. But nothing will happen. You wanna bet? Hey I can't... I can't get these on. Here, buddy. Try these. Gee, thanks. What's the idea, that your boy can't get his shoes on? Ah! Ha ha ha. It's my fault. Uh... An oversight. The boys grow bigger these days. What are you talking about? Have you got a good seat? Of course not. You can't trust any newspaper woman. But what am I gonna do? Not bad. I just can't believe the kid is as good as all that. How could he be? Where would he have been keeping himself? - Henry. - Yes, Benny. Go out there and tell buster to throw hard. He is throwing hard. Can't you hear him grunt? Well, go out there and tell him to bear it down. Sure, Benny. Battin' practice is one thing. But how does he do in a game, huh? He's got a nice swing. - He's gone. - Over the fence. Just luck. This is costin' the club money. Hey, kid. Yeah, you. Come here. What did you say your name was? Joe, uh... Yes sir, Joe. Joe Hardy. Well, you hit the ball pretty good. - Thanks. - How's your fielding? - Uh, I don't know. - You don't know? Well, I... I mean... I meant my manager was supposed... You want me, Joe? Well, yeah Mr. Applegate. They, uh, they want me to field some. Well, go ahead, boy. You can do anything, you know that. How do you like my boy, Mr. Van Buren? - Not bad. - Not bad? Did he kiss that horsehide right out of the park? Did he get the fat end of the bat on that pill? Bye bye, baby. How about that? Hey. Who's up there? Mel Allen? Hey! He's got an arm. Got an arm? He's got an arm like a Cannon. What's the story on this kid? You saw the way he was hittin' em, didn't you? Over the garden wall. Attaboy, Joe. Rifle it home, boy. - Rifle it home. - Where's he come from? His name is Joe Hardy. Who's he been playing for? He weighs a 193 pounds and he chews juicy fruit. You're a big help. Never played on anything, but sand lot ball, huh? Whereabouts? - Out west. - Yeah. The, uh, the Midwest. Uh... Hannibal. - Hannibal, Missouri. - Is that your home town? Uh, yeah, that's it. Boy, it, uh, it sure gets hot there sometimes. We just sit around and wait for that cold air to come down from Canada. - Well, you do pretty good. - Gee, thanks. I think we might give you a contract. Send you out to one of our farm clubs. For a little seasoning. Seasoning? That's ridiculous. - How about it, kid? - Uh, no, no. - I don't think so. - What do you mean? Well, uh, I um... I haven't got time. - Time? - Baseball's in a rut. If babe Ruth came here looking for a chance, you would send him to little rock for three years. Alright, Joe. Come on. We'll go where we'll be appreciated. Gee, Mr. Van Buren. Give me one more chance, will you? - I love the Senators. - So do I. And there's only a few of us left. Get your bat. Buster. More seasoning, huh? The ball is only going for a 600 foot ride. That's the longest ball I ever saw in my life. I swallowed my chewing tobacco. I just can't believe it. Where would he have been all these years? Okay, you win, get a uniform. - You mean it? - I mean it. Well, I made it. Oh, man, oh, man. Hey, Mr. Applegate, how could I ever thank you. I'll find some way. Your attention please. Now coming into bat for Sohovic number two, Joe Hardy. There he comes now, that's the kid I wrote the story about. Strike! Right down the middle. Why don't you look at it, you bum? What a ball club! Where did they pick him up? What a belt! Clean over the fence. I told you that guy looked good when he first come up to bat. It's just too good to be true, Mr. Welch. In practice, he was terrific. Well, I said to myself, he'll choke up when he gets in the game. He bounced two out of the ballpark. Well, let's do anything we can to make him happy. Let's get a lot of publicity. - No, no, no, not yet. - Huh? He seems to be afraid of reporters. - Afraid? - Yeah. I showed him that cute story Gloria Thorpe did yesterday about his shoes and I swear he turned pale. She's down there now trying to get a follow up on it. But Joe's ducking her. He's a strange boy, Mr. Welch. Very strange. What's Joe trying to do anyway? - Avoid me? - Oh, no, miss Thorpe. - He wouldn't do that. - Well... Didn't he like that stuff I wrote yesterday? You guys would go for that, wouldn't you? - Any time, lady. - Now tell me. What's he like really? - He takes it serious. - Oh, dedicated Dan, huh? - Huh? - Wait a minute. I got it. Shoeless Joe Hardy. Is that what you're gonna call him? It's what everybody's gonna call him. Shoeless Joe, huh? That's pretty good. I'll help you celebrate, boys. - Oh, what's the gag? - Let's make Joe famous. - Sure, I'm willing. - Okay.

Go see her, cheer yourself up. - Uh, he wouldn't like it. - Huh? - Who wouldn't? - Forget it. Well, don't let her get you in no dark corner. By gosh, you gave me an idea. You know, I think I will.

Well, that's what they said, some fella down at the corner. I'm looking for a nice quiet place. Well, my goodness, I never even thought of renting a room. Well, I wouldn't be any trouble, I can promise you that. Well, I'm sure you wouldn't, but... - You see, mister, mister... - Uh, Hardy. Uh, Joe Hardy. My husband's name is Joe. Oh, is that so? That's quite a coincidence. He's away. - Well, that's too bad. - Yes, it's... - For long? - No, not too long. I hope, he had to go on a trip and... Maybe that's why this fella thought you might have an extra room. - Meg? - Oh, dear, excuse me. We're cooking for the bridge club, a friend of mine, her sister from my hometown. Just make yourself at home. I think it'd be a good idea, that's what I think. Well, we ought to meet him first. Oh, he's a good boy. You could just tell that. Come on, you can introduce us. Well, wait till I fix my hair, dumbbell. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry to have taken so long. My friends think it'll be good for me to take in a boarder. Well, I'd certainly appreciate it. Well, they're coming right in to meet you. Okay. Now, um, I have a room that was my husband's den that we use as a guest room, has a nice studio couch. - Would you like to see it? - I know it'll be alright. And, uh, another thing, I'd have to ask you not to use the downstairs when I have bridge club. - That's every three days. - Well, that wouldn't bother me. I... I go away quite a bit anyhow. I'd be out of town for like two or three weeks at a time. Oh. Oh, here they are. I want you to meet my friends. Um, sister Miller. - Hello, there. - Doris Miller. - How do you do? - And this is Mr. Harper. Isn't it a gorgeous day? Oh! Oh, my goodness. - This is Joe Hardy. - What? You're Joe Hardy, aren't you? Yeah, I guess I am. It's Joe Hardy, Meg. He's not Mr. Harper, it's Joe Hardy. Why, he's the greatest baseball... Oh, my goodness. I'm flabbergasted. Oh, gee, Joe... You don't know what's happened to you, Meg. He's a hero. Yes, good morning. I'm from city hall. - Where? - City hall. Just serving official notice in the neighborhood. - What kind of notice? - A new zoning law. No one is permitted to take roomers in this neighborhood. But they do, people do. - Effective as of today. - What's this? - This man said I... - It's alright, Meg. I mean, Mrs. Boyd, I... I know this man. Just... just let me talk to him, I'll be right in. Really, Mr. Applegate, this is carrying things too far. Well, do you think I like it, wasting my time? Not to mention the money spent on costumes. Don't you just know what I'm doing without all that effort? No, Joe, I have to do most things the hard way. The only thing that comes really easy is the cigarette trick. And now I'm trying to break myself of the filthy habit. Is it anything so terrible just want to come home? It's gauche. You know how I feel about home and wives? Well, you don't own me yet, not till the 24th. Look, Joe. I'm going to send for a beautiful girl. A real sexy baby. I don't want a real sexy baby. And if you want to know what's happened, I've rented a room here. But I told you to stay away from... Ooh, my hoof... He's gone. What'd he you say? Oh, he's just a practical joker. Oh, well, I'm not much of a judge of character. That's what my husband always said. We're gonna fix your room up with a lot of Jo-Jo baseball pictures, Mr. Hardy. My husband's a great fan, you know? Oh, a fanatic. Every night in front of that television set you'd see that big fat slob sitting there. - Hello? - I need you, Lola. What? Oh, hello. Oh, is that you, chief? I want you here in Washington. But, chief, I'm still working on Clarence. I've got to put you on a new assignment. Alright, chief, I'll get there. I'll work hard. I'll finish 'em up and be there tomorrow. Well, see you do. Good-bye. All I can say is the press has been pretty good to Joe. Maybe he ought to co-operate. We can't write anything if Joe can't remember anything. You must have some family. No, no, nobody. They've all passed away. Gone. Dead. What about friends? Well, he's got one friend I know of. Put me down, little girl. What about friends back in Hannibal, heard from any of them? Uh, well... If you will, uh, permit me to say a word. I happen to represent the Hannibal bugle and, uh, I'm telling you right now that everybody in our little old town is just as proud as pumpkins of little old Joe. Well, thank little old you, and thank little old Joe. Quit riding the boy, will you? He's gone from pinch hitter to idol of the nation in one month. He's made our whole team come to life. He told you about those shoes. He just picked up the wrong pair. Now if you want to ask any more questions, ask me. Okay. Do you think Washington will win the pennant? Yeah, when I swim the channel. What's so funny? What's so darn funny about Washington winning the pennant? Well, who's winning more games than we are? Oh, no, Joe. I don't see why it's such a funny idea that we should cut the pennant. All we have to do is win games. Hear, hear. I... I guess I talked to much. No, you didn't. These newspaper people don't know what it means to have your heart in a ball club. I tell you in baseball, anything can happen. You said we'd never make the first division. But we're there. Now, I say we'll have that pennant sewed up by the 25th of September. That's what we think, isn't it, Joe? The 25th. The season ends at 25th? That's right, boy. We'll have it sewed up by the 24th. There's a statement for ya. How sneaky can a fella get? Lola! Hiya, chief. - Well? - Here I am. - Have a nice trip? - Oh, perfect. The plane crashed in Cleveland. Good. Now, about that job in Chicago. Just dandy. I got the old boy to embezzle a hundred thousand dollars and lost it for him at the racetrack. Then his wife left him and he took to drink. I told him I was through and he jumped out the window. Twenty-second story. That's high enough. That's fine. I'm gonna try the empire state building on this next one. No, no, no, no, no, Lola. This is a straight seduction job. A new boy I just got hold of. Look, Lola, I, uh, I've done a terribly foolish thing. I'm really ashamed to confess it. I've let this real estate idiot talk me into an escape clause. - I've never heard of it. - You'll never hear of it again. It slipped by me, I... I've got too much on my mind. - I'm overworked. - Oh, I know, poor dear. - Elections coming up. - Yeah. So when I made this Joe Hardy deal... - Joe Hardy? - That's his name. He's a baseball player. Yeah, no, Clarence just raved about him. - Who's Clarence? - You know. Oh, yeah, that one. Look, Lola, here's the tie up. This is a mass torture deal like the thirty years war. I've got thousands of Washington fans drooling under the illusion that the Senators are gonna win the pennant. Oh, chief, that's awfully good. When they lose, there will be suicides and heart attacks and apoplexy. Just like the good old days. But the key to the whole thing is this Joe Hardy. And he wants to go home to his wife. Well, don't worry, chief, you know I'm pretty good at making men forget their wives. This is a routine case. I'll give him the standard vampire treatment. Sure, sure, uh, there isn't a homewrecker on my staff better than you, Lola. But this fellow is stubborn. Oh, come on, chief, you know I've got what it takes.

Yeah, we jumped over a team, that's all. - Yeah, boy. - We'll eat 'em for less. Hardy! Ain't had such a good time in years. Well, I hope those so-called bombers enjoyed themselves as much as I did. Hey, you look pretty near like a ball player today. Three for five, kid, three for five. Now, boys, get some sleep. - Three for five! Now, tomorrow, we'll pin their ears back and bow knot for them. Right. Mr. Applegate, I'd like to ask you just one more question. When Joe was back in Hannibal, did he have the same name? Yes. Hardy. You spell it with an "h." What's so funny? Uh, something came to mind. It isn't important. He played a nice game today. His batting average went up three more points. Now it's 524. That's not bad for a raw rookie. Yes. Very raw. Lovely girl. I know she'll make some nice young men very unhappy. Three for five. Hey, rock, that dumb blonde tomato from the drug store is out there waiting for you. Three for five? She asked was I the reception committee. You are sure dressed for the part. - Okay, baby, here I come. - Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening. Ah, great game, Joe. Great game. - Goodnight, Joe. - Goodnight, Joe. Goodnight, Joe, - Goodnight, Joe. - See ya. - Well, Joe... We showed those Yankees, didn't we? Well, if we could just take that double-header tomorrow wouldn't that be great? You will, you will. I feel it in my bones. Oh, Joe. Joe, did you happen to notice the charming young lady sitting in the box with me? - Yeah, I saw somebody. - She wants to meet you. I'll bring her in. Wait till I get my pants on. That's my boy. You know, I got sort of a date tonight. At home, I mean. I know, you don't like it. Ah, I do like it, Joe. I've changed my mind. - I want you to be happy. - Thanks. But this is a real sweet kid and she wants to meet you, so I... Well, sure, sure. Lola. She was talking about you all through the game. Ah, here we are. This is my friend Lola. - How do you do? - This is Joe Hardy. I have seen him from a distance. And admired him. You should not tell that I admire. Joe, this is senorita Lolita Hernando. You may have seen her picture in the paper. She was miss west indies. Well, it certainly is a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. Joe, uh... Keep Lola a company a second. I gotta get a hot dog. Oh, but, uh... Where are my manners? You wanna sit down? You are so polite. This is where you all get ready. Yes, ma'am. Interesting. Oh, the truth is, Mr. Joe, I do not know how to talk to a man so famous like you. Oh, how about you miss west indies, that's going some. Oh, it is silly. I am ashamed, he told you. Mr. Applegate tries to show me off too much. Because my pictures in the papers and because maybe I'm pleasing to look in a bathing suit. Is that important? Well, uh, as the fellas around here would say, "it ain't bad." Oh, no, Joe, what is inside me if I am an interesting person, that is important. Oh, I agree. Thank you. What is those? Oh, uh, that... that's when we pack our duffel when we go on the road. Oh, Joe. You like music, you like dancing? I'm not very hot at dancing, but, uh, I like, I like music though. I studied the cornet for three years. You help me down, please? Oh, sure. Thank you. I, um... I really studied for four years... Uh, my, uh, my... my teacher said I had a... a... a... a natural lip. For playing the cornet that is, I mean, well... To... to play the cornet, you just gotta have good lips. Oh, gosh. Oh, Joe you are a wonderful boy. - I am? - You are so honest. Oh, I'm honest but I'm dumb, too. Oh, I like people who do not brag about themselves. Me too. I wonder where Applegate... You know something? I think you and I feel just alike about... Things. We do? I think we should become to know each other quite well. Joe... Would you like to take Lola some place tonight? Gee, I-I sure would like to but, uh... You know what Mr. Van Buren would say. He'd say, "you lucky boy." No, no. He'd say it's late. He likes us to get to bed early. Any particular place? Oh, Joe... You think I am a naughty girl. No, I... I don't, only, uh... Well, you see, I rented a room out in Chevy chase this afternoon and I promised to move in tonight. I've got to go home. Home? Yes, I promised to be there. You want to hurt Lola's feelings? No, no. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. Well, Lola wants you to say with her. Oh, we... we have to keep training, strict rules and all that. You can tell me all the rules. You're... you're making things very complicated. Then be a good boy. I'm... I'm trying to.

Let's make this a good party tonight. Don't worry. I'm not gonna let anyone see how I feel. Oh, we've come to the end of the season better than I ever dreamed. Two games to go. Now, now, now, you just relax. We'll be the champions. All we have to do is win just one of those games. But the way Joe cracked up on us today. Is that so? She just asked me. Would I like to be her partner? She's good. We've been rehearsing the whole week. Hey, that's the one. "Sure don't know how to thank you for this wonderful turnout tonight.” Congratulations. Oh, it's you. You see, I've become a fan. Officially. We're putting on a dance in your honor tonight. That's, uh, that's very nice, Ms. Fernando. No, Joe, Ms. Fernando's gone. No accent, didn't you notice? She failed dismally. Kidding me again, I guess. No, Joe. Kidding myself. I'm just a bold hussy who's organized a fan club... Without instructions from Applegate. He wanted us to lose today, didn't he? Didn't you hear him giving me the razz throughout the whole game? You know, personal things. Anything to throw my game off. That's why I threw the ball in the stands. I was trying to hit him. You let in two runs and hit an old lady he was delighted. What does he want? - Tomorrow's the 24th. - Yeah. I think he doesn't want to lose you. Uh... uh, what do you want? I'd like to be your friend. Thanks. Oh, Joe, you make me feel girlish. And I'm a 172 years old. You see... Many men have loved me. Hopelessly. But I felt nothing. Would you believe it you're such a good, loyal dumb, ordinary man. You make me feel tender. It's quite exciting. Folderol. You heard what I said. Folderol. We go on seven. Will you watch? - Sure. - Folderol! What business is it of yours where Joe lives. I'm curious, that's all. Well, he couldn't stand the publicity. You see, he's like I am. He's shy. Joe moved to a hotel because... Why did you move, Joe? To be near you. Boy's got spirit, don't you think? I think a lot of things, my friend, you see... I've just come back from a trip to Hannibal, Missouri. Well, did you drop in to say hello to the boys at the bugle? There is no bugle, Mr. Applejuice. - You know my name? - Yes, I do. But I don't know Joe Hardy's name. What was the crack? One thing I do know his name is not Joe Hardy. Well, if you're referring to the rumor that he is in reality shifty McCoy, I deny it emphatically. Huh? Who... Oh, who... who's shifty McCoy? Alright, alright, if you haven't heard it I haven't said it. What's your big problem anyhow? Why do you say he's not Joe Hardy? Nobody in Hannibal has ever seen or heard of Joe Hardy. His birth is not registered there. He's a faker! Where'd he come from? Don't be so nosy, huh? Go home! Get married! Have children. ♪ So when the bases are loaded ♪ the count is three and two ♪ you'll hit a homer Joe ♪ we can depend on you ♪ you're a hero 'cause ♪ you've got heart. You're wanted on stage. - Up we go. - Benny? You look pretty. Oh, Benny, ever hear of a ball player named shifty McCoy? Shifty McCoy? Isn't he the kid that took a bribe in the Mexican league about four years ago? - Oh? - Yeah. Yeah, through a game and they caught him at it. - What happened to him? - Oh, he took it on the lam. Never been heard of since as far as I know. - Did you know him? - No. No, Ms. Thorpe. I just saw his picture in the paper. The paper? Oh. And this is Joe's night. And I'm not gonna start it off with a long speech. Later on, you may have to listen to a tribute or two. But right now, we're going to sit down and see what some of Joe's fan clubs think of him. Shifty McCoy! Of course, I'm sure! Get all the stuff on him and hold everything, I'll be right over! And now, number seven. We have a tribute from the... "I love Joe" fan club.

I won't believe it. Why should they say such a thing? But it's not true, not any of it. I'm not a crook! I wouldn't double-cross you, Benny. I'd die for the team. And I will! And we'll win! We've got to! We'll win, we'll win! No. Oh, no. Joe is down at the commissioner's right now. But the whole town is behind him. Parades, speeches... They know an okay guy when they see one and so do I. Joe ain't done nothing wrong. I'll bet you the Yankees are behind this whole thing. - Yeah, they're scared of us. - That's right! Whether Joe's with us today or not you guys are going out there and you're gonna play red-hot baseball. You're the best team in the league and you know it. And when you take the field, I want you to forget about Joe! And fill that ball park with so many base hits those Cleveland Indians will think it's the third world war. Alright, I'll tell you. Because I value the good name of baseball more than I do of victory of my own team. Well, just because a picture in the paper taken four years ago happens to look something like it. Mr. Welch, Ms. Thorpe has the floor. I know, I know. It's not because of the picture. The picture only fortified my suspicion that he had a phony background. And my paper has taken the trouble to bring a few witnesses from Hannibal if you care to hear them. Certainly, go ahead. Mr. Hawkins? This is the postmaster from Hannibal. Read about it. "Joe on trial!" Read about it. "Joe on trial!" Just answer me one thing, boy. If as you say, you were brought up in Hannibal how do you recount for the fact that no one seem to remember you. Well, uh, I... I... I... I told you... - Ah! Good news! - What is it, Mr. Applegate? I asked for a recess until 10:30 tonight. I have a witness flying in from Mexico City who knew shifty McCoy! Well, I don't know what to think. We know he just never came from Hannibal. We just know that. Well, I know something else that's more important. - He's a good boy. - I didn't say he wasn't. I may not be a judge of character but I know when somebody's good. You're darn tootin'. And if Joe picked out Hannibal as the town he'd like to come from he must have his good reasons. And it's an honor to the town. Can you imagine that old Mr. Hawkins getting up there at that hearing and saying those things? Well, we could get up there, too. What? It's just psychology, baby. Just psychology. And once I've got him for keeps I'll make him throw the game. Oh, he'll burn. He'll burn! As for me, I'm sorry. What did you say? I said I'm sorry for him. I have observed of late... A certain laxity on your part. Have you forgotten every principle I've ever taught you? Alright, Lola, 100 times. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for anybody. I'm gonna select something appropriate for this evening's hearing. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for anybody. That looks terrible. I'll wear that. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for anybody... Ah! Now can anybody guess who that is? Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for... Come in, Joe! Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for anybody... Alright, Lola, knock it off. Later. We've got the greatest baseball player in the world with us. Let us do him homage. It's very kind of you to say that, Mr. Applegate but it doesn't look as if Joe Hardy will ever make the hall of fame. One can never tell. I made my decision, Mr. Applegate that's what I came to talk to you about. I want to exercise the escape clause which is to take place on the 24th which is today. Well, now... Aren't you being a little hasty? I've thought it all over I found out there's something more important in life than being a hero. Deep, this boy. - Very deep. - I want out. I wanna go back. Very well. An operation of this kind must take place at the witching hour. So, at 5 minutes to midnight if you still wanna go back say the word. Well, suppose this hearing is still going on, are you gonna change me right there in front of everybody? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That would cause talk. All you have to do is say "let us step into the next room." Joe Hardy will go through that door and he will never return. "Took it on the lam,” they'll say. I just want to be sure there's no misunderstanding. Goodbye, Lola. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for anybody. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry for any... Alright, Lola, let's not have just the letter. Let's have the spirit. Never feel sorry for anybody, never feel sorry... And, uh, don't get too impudent with me or I'll degrade you and get Clementine in here for this work. You get too fresh with me and I'll put you back on your broom. Now, while I go to the hearing you sit down there and you think of three dirty tricks. And they better be good. Well, I'll tell you what it's called. It's called perjury. I call it helping out an innocent friend. I call it exciting. Mr. commissioner! How can you believe these witnesses? Subtle, sophisticated... Oh, bosh. Can twist this simple man around her finger? Who is simple? Now, you wait a minute. One side, please. Let us through! We're material witnesses. I ask for a little Patience. My witness in on the way from the airport. But I can't wait that long, you know that. I don't understand. He does. It's nearly midnight. Don't worry, Joe. - We came here to witness. - Now wait a minute, lady. We've decided that we should speak up. We're material witnesses. Why, hello there, Mr. Hawkins. Well, May Parker, how are you, May? It's the Miller girls. You seem to be old acquaintances. We'd like to take the stand and testify. We'll take the oath or anything. Well, you see, at first, we didn't remember Joe and then when I remembered him, and reminded the girls then pretty soon, they remembered him too. Hello there, Joe. My, I just hardly know you now you've grown up so. You knew him? Oh, we picked huckleberries together. You must remember him, Mr. Hawkins. Don't you mind, he used to come in and collect the mail for old Mrs. peeper. It's five minutes before midnight. What is it, Mr. Hardy? Oh, I'd like to go in the other room and talk to Mr. Applegate. Wait, Joe, he remembers ya. Sure, now I remember him. I knew it! I knew Joe wouldn't lie! Silence. Quiet please. Why that boy sat there and let them call him a liar to his face and now by George, he's vindicated. I don't want anyone to leave the room. We didn't care what the paper said we never lost faith in Joe. He may have come from a poor family. But that's no disgrace in this day and age. Certainly some of the greatest men in our country came from poor families. And the way it's turned out now some of the greatest baseball players did too. You see, we three all knew each other when we were young back in Hannibal and Mr. Hawkins knew us. So that when we heard about this thing we couldn't bear to see an injustice done and that's why we pushed through. Although the corridors are so crowded I just thought we'd never make it. But we did. Joe. Where is he? He's asleep. I gave him a pill. Why didn't you give him two? I did. Move over. Sure, why not? We're both in the same boat now. Joe, don't cry. Joe, you're gonna win. - Maybe. - I fixed it for you. I said I gave him two pills, I gave him four. He was so delighted with himself, horsing around. He said, give me a drink of demon rum. You know, big joke. So I did and I slipped four pills into it. He won't wake up until after the game. But I wanted him to be there. I wanted him to have to sit right there and watch us win the pennant. If he were there, you wouldn't win. Oh, no, Benny's putting me out in center field I wouldn't hear him yell at me out there I wouldn't even have to look at him. It wouldn't make any difference. He owns you now. Boy. I see. I didn't know how it worked. But, Lola, what were you? I was the ugliest woman in Providence, Rhode Island. Well, he'll be... He'll be good and sored at what you did. You think he'll turn you back? Oh, he threatens. Two lost souls. I don't know whether to cry or make jokes. Oh, Joe, jokes make jokes. We're together tonight and be never again. Well, then, we ought to make the best of it. Please. How do we do that? You think of some way. Give me a second now, I'll figure something out. See, I got it. Joe, you like music, you like dancing. Well, I'm not very odd at dancing but I like music though. But he's supposed to be in training. He's relaxin', leave him alone.

I'm supposed to be at the game. Well, I tried to wake you. There's something funny going on here. Look, I shook you and shook you. - What's the score? - Oh, it's about even. The score. Washington leads, one to nothing. Last of the seventh. It's not too late. I'll get dressed in a flash. Well, come on. I see it all now. You doped me. But why? Why? Because I love him. Love? Here we are, mister. You're just gonna catch the last inning. Somebody's gonna pay for this. I'll pay just as long as Joe wins. He won't win. He'll lose even if I have to change him back right there in front of everyone. Well, I don't wanna see it. Come back here, you. Come back here, I said. Now, no more nonsense. Come on, will you? Ball one. What's the score? What's the score? One to nothing, Washington. Get a all in one, Mickey sew it up, Mickey. Sew it up. Strike one. Strike him out. The big bum! He can't hit it. Ball one.
