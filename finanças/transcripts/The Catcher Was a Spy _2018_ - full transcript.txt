There he is. Is this your first job? - My first job? - Hm. I've never killed a man if that's what you mean. It's not as hard as you might think. - Depends on the man. - Which man? The target, or the man doing the killing? Both. Tell me, friend, what did you do before the war? I was a baseball player. You know baseball? Oh, baseball. Like Joe DiMaggio. Did he ever kill anyone? Not that I know of. Good luck, my friend. You'll be fine. Just do it before the Gestapo figures it out. I'll try. Two out top of the third, man on first. Moe Berg still in the catcher. Fifteen years in the league and still standing. How long can this guy go on? Runner takes his lead. Moe calls the sign. Okay, now here's the pitch. The runner goes. Berg throws down to second. Got him. Hey, don't shake me off. I don't wanna a change-up when somebody's stealing. I barely got him. How'd you know where he was goin'? I just knew. How you holding up? What do you mean? Sooner or later I'm gonna need your spot on the roster, Moe. - Make it later. - It is later. I've been asking for two seasons to hang up the cleats and coach. I like it out there. You hardly play. All the more reason to hang on. Look, I didn't want to stop playin' either. So, what do you say? Finish out the season, then coach? I could go to Detroit. Mickey'd let me play. Mickey's an idiot. So are you, for letting me play. You get a call about the Japan thing? Yeah. - You goin'? - Absolutely. - Who else is going? - Uh, we got Murderers' Row. We got Ruth, Gehrig, Averill, Gehringer, Gomez. Am I the only bum? They like the Professor Berg thing. They also like that you speak Japanese. Who said I speak Japanese? Kieran, in one of his columns. - Interesting. - Say.. Barker House? Steaks? No, thanks. Okay, mystery man. What you staring at, rookie? What's the story with Berg? - What do you mean? - Uh, he seems strange. What the hell are you talking about? I don't know. He just seems odd. Mind you own business, Dalton. Does he, does he bat lefty? How the hell should I know? Why should I care? It's just I don't feel like showing my dick to a queer. Well, don't show it to him, then. Somebody ought to find out. You're Moe Berg, aren't you? Who? Moe Berg, the baseball player. Oh, no. You know, but I must look like him. Everybody says I look like him. You're kidding. No, I ain't him. But I sure as hell must look like him. Ha! Where am I dropping you? A couple more blocks. I'll walk from there. It's fine. Suit yourself.. ...Mr. Berg. Actually, you know what, stop. Here. That's good. I wouldn't have been able to tell. Really? Well, I was on my third martini by that point, so -- You flatter me. So, what did you think of the place, honey? Mr. Dalton, you live around here? Man, fuck you! I didn't catch your answer. Do you live around here? - Do you live around here? - No! No. Do you know what the word "Hypothetical" means? No? It means, let's suppose. Let's suppose there was a baseball player a rookie, who intruded on the privacy of another ballplayer who was reaching the twilight of his career and really had nothing to lose at this point. Are you following so far? You fucking faggot! You think you know everything, don't you? I don't know anything, alright? I.. Now, you'll be pleased to know Cronin.. Cronin is considering putting you in the lineup. Show some improvement and you got a shot. Good luck. Don't stop. That's beautiful. You're a liar. And you're late. I had some people to see. Play. Where did that come from? The way you looked at me when I came in. Any normal man would've done the same thing. I didn't look at you. I had my back turned. And the reason that I love you is that you're the farthest thing from a normal man that anyone would ever think of. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for.. The Information Game! Yes, the show where the elite meet to mete out the meat of their minds. Tonight, our special guest is Moe Berg catcher for the Boston Red Sox, and for those of you who actually read John Kieran's articles will know him as Professor Berg top graduate from Princeton University also holding advanced degrees from Columbia University and the Sorbonne University in Paris, France. Welcome, Professor Berg. Thank you. Moe will do. - Happy to be here. - Well, Moe it is. And, Moe, let's play ball. Our first question is for you. - Excellent. - Thank you. Very well done. And I'll see you next week. - Thank you. - Bye. Bye-bye. Trick question? Me? The Canary Islands aren't named for a canary. The name is derived from the Latin word canis which means dog. The islands were named for the wild dogs that are found there. Right you are. Well, so far, Moe Berg is batting a thousand! So, Moe, tell us a little bit about yourself. Is there a Mrs. Berg? Ah, yes, she's married to my father. I meant is there a Mrs. Berg in your life? Does this count for points? Wow, you sure wriggled your way out of that one. Moe Berg, the walking enigma. That is.. Well, that's the case with old Whitby. - Very similar. - Was it always? Always. Because of that, people -- How do you know all of these things? Well, it's common knowledge. Well.. Oh, I'm going to Japan. An exhibition tour after the season. Oh, Moe, I have always wanted to see Japan. I'll take some pictures. Or you could take me, and I'll take the pictures myself. - Oh, Estella, come on. - I'd really like to go, Moe. It's just a series of exhibition games. And I'm sure the other players are taking their wives. You're not my wife. Mm. I didn't mean anything by that. I was simply stating it as a fact. - It was more than that, Moe. - It wasn't more than anything. - Estella. - What? Why do you not want to take me to Japan, Morris? I would just rather go alone. Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? Tokyo is host of Babe Ruth and his barnstorming American baseball team on their goodwill exhibition tour of Japan. Jesus Christ. He know their languages. That makes 12. Welcome to Japan, Mr. Berg. I'm sure you're going to enjoy it here. My name is Isao Kawabata. It's such a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is mutual. Move it, move it! Don't they know he only batted 235? Right. - Oh! - Oh! Please, tell me all about baseball. It looked like such as interesting game. You don't know anything? Nothing. Well, baseball's a game where people fail a lot more often than they succeed. Sounds very much like life. Yes, it does. So, what do you do? I am a professor of history. Now that sounds interesting. So why would a professor who doesn't know anything about baseball be at a game? Maybe you don't fully understand, Mr. Berg. This visit is very important. It goes beyond sport. Our cultures are very different, and growing further apart. If we don't stop to learn about one another, then.. Then what? There'll be no more games. You're happy here? I am. Why? When I was growing up my first baseball team was a church team. But I'm a Jew. Now, I was never a practicing Jew but I was different than the other boys. I never even told them my real name. I tried to blend in. I wanted to hide. And it worked. Do you like to hide, Mr. Berg? I do. I don't fit. Even now, I have no real home, I have no wife. Do you have a wife, Isao? I do. And six children. She's very fertile. I like to hide too. Now, can I ask you an important question? Yes. You're a professor of history. Will there be a war between our two countries? Yes. It has been progressing step-by-step. It is quite inevitable. Everything will change. And we'll all play our part. I also think after this visit.. ...we will never see each other again. I hope you're wrong. As do I. The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. Hello, Jerry. Moe, nice to see you. Been a long time. I was hoping you'd be here. Oh, yeah? Why? I understand you're working in Washington. Where'd you hear that? One of the guys. I can't remember who. - State Department? - Uh, yeah, sort of. How'd you come to get the job? There's room for people with languages. That's what I figured. - How are your knees? - What do you mean? I figure a professional ballplayer's getting 4F. Bad hinges. My knees are as passable as my Italian. Have you heard of Bill Donovan? Yeah, sure. Yale, football. Medal of Honor, 1918. He's my boss. We're setting up a small adjunct to the State Department. Here's the number. - Give this man a call. - Thanks. First time I've seen you at one of these things. Well, first time I've come to one. Gentlemen, may I have your attention please? We are at war. In light of what lies before us the challenges, the sacrifices the losses. I ask you, gentlemen of Princeton to join us in the singing of the "Battle Hymn Of The Republic." ♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.. ♪ Sorry for the song choice.

Interesting film you brought back, Mr. Berg. What made you make it? I happened to be in Japan. A lot of people happen to be in Japan. Not all of them go to the top of a building in Tokyo and make home movies of the harbor and naval shipyards. I had the opportunity. It seemed the sensible thing to do. How did you know then that we would be at war with Japan? "The Journal Of Oriental Society" was filled with articles about going to war with Japan. You read the "JOS?" Ah, uh, well, that wasn't apparent from what I just said? Yes, yes, I suppose it was. But no one in the government or the army asked you to make the film? No. You did it as a private citizen? Yes. You're an unusual man, Mr. Berg. Yes, so I'm told. Have a seat. Not married, no children. Odd for a man your age, no? Never occurred to me. May I ask you a very personal question? You may. Are you queer? I'm good at keeping secrets. You're also good at some other things. You speak seven languages fluently another three or four to a lesser degree. In addition, you're an athlete, which means you're more than up to the physical requirements of the job. What job? Any job we might care to give you in the event that we bring you into the fold. Moe, Jerry Fredericks speaks very highly of you. We're looking for people who can keep secrets but not from us. We're fighting a war here. It's very serious business. Now, personally, I don't care who a man fucks as long as he can help us win this war. If it comes down to it I'm willing to die for my country. They say that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. It isn't they. It's Samuel Johnson. And it's not the last, it's the first. Welcome to the OSS, Mr. Berg. There were many new developments today at home and abroad. The headlines, Germans claim victory in the Crimea. The Russians report gains around Moscow and Leningrad. President Roosevelt signs the Neutrality Law. And then captive coal mine strike ties up production. And Congress prepares anti-strike legislation. And in France, the Germans advanced along the Saint-Michel salient taking in the town of Saint Ramelle and Toulon. On the southern front allied advances continued in Sicily. Great report on the Serbian border unit. Thank you. I'm going crazy. I am not made for desk work, alright? You got to get me out onto the field. - You're useful here. - Well, I hate it, alright? I'm used to being on a ball field all day. If I stay cooped up in here, I'm going to kill somebody. Maybe myself. Oh! - Oh! - Oh! Mr. Berg! Yeah? Someone chasing you? I don't know. Well, it's good that you're here. Come with me. Where are we going? Be careful what you wish for, Berg. Because you just might get it? Because it could get you killed. Gentlemen. Moe Berg. Bob Furman. Hi, nice to meet you. This is Professor Sam Goudsmit. If you would. Bob, Moe, Sam. We have something for you. Since this war began.. ...we've been engaged in a massive research and development program, called the Manhattan Project. The purpose of which is the creation of a fission bomb. Now, if initial calculations are correct one bomb would be enough to wipe out an entire city. The war could be decided in a day. We have reason to believe the Germans are also working on such a bomb. Sam. The scientist leading the atomic fission program is Werner Heisenberg. So, we must get to him and find out how close the Germans are to a bomb. Now, he has left Berlin. And we don't know where he is or what he is doing. But, uh, he has remained in contact with an Italian physicist with whom I worked, uh, Eduardo Amaldi. So we'd start in Italy, the three of us. Sam for the physics, me, military and you, OSS. - Where in Italy? - Rome. Our fifth army is moving north. They should take the city in a week or two. We'll go in, find the physicist and interrogate him. Uh, interview him, please. Amaldi is my friend. Uh, if the Italian physicist has any value won't the Germans take him when they pull out, or kill him? Well, that's why we'd actually go in with the Fifth Army to prevent that from happening. It's not desk work. No, it's not. Could be fun. Ah, an athlete's uncomplicated hubris. I do not speak of fun, Mr. Berg. Figure of speech. If the enemy intercepts your communication they can easily discern what you have written there simply by holding the paper over a flame or treating it with a reactive chemical such as sodium carbonate. The German MP 40. Very effective weapon for close combat. Never hold the gun by the clip when firing as that can cause the gun to jam.

It's just work. And when do you go back to DC? I, uh, I'm not going to DC. Not for a while. Well, how long do I have you? Hm? Till tomorrow. - Why am I not surprised? - I'm sorry, Stell. I'm.. ...going overseas. You brought me here to say goodbye? - I'll be back. - Who knows? Y -- you know that I love you. Simple yes or no. D -- do you know that I love you? I really wanted us to be perfect. That's all. We are. Liar. Difficult? - May I? - Hey. Come in. Tell me about Heisenberg. Well, he's a somewhat complicated man. Yeah, just before the war started uh, we were together at the conference at the University of Michigan. And Furman and I begged him not to go back to Germany. - But he went. - Yeah. But to save German science from the Nazis. And now he's the head of the atomic bomb program. Could he build a bomb? Could he or would he? Both. The could of it would require enormous physical and financial resources perhaps more than Germany has at its disposal. But with the resources, he could do it. Yes. And the would of it? I don't know. I don't know. So you were friends? You knew him well? Yeah. Do you still consider him a friend? You are a Jew, yeah, Mr. Berg? Jewish. A -- after the Nazis occupied Holland my parents were taken to Auschwitz. Now, I contacted Heisenberg and I asked him I... begged him to do what he could. And we haven't spoken since. I don't know if they're dead or alive. Thanks. I'm not comfortable with this. We'll be alright. What if there are Germans waiting for us? Then we'll probably get shot and killed. This has all the variables of a disaster. Sam, stop your whining. - Ah-ha. - Here we are. Welcome to Italy, sir. Be careful! You doing alright? - You don't look so great. - Nah.. Quite well, thank you. Who the hell are you? - What's up there? - Goddamn Germans. Left the rearguard division. Paying for every inch. What's the safest way to Piazza Leone? Why don't you drive south 30 miles find yourself a nice hotel, wait a week? We can't wait. Alright, fine. Your call. Look, stay on the Via Appia as long as you can. Stash your Jeep when it gets too messy. But as of this morning that whole area was crawling with Krauts. - And good luck. - Thanks. Alright, let them through. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Follow me and stay down. Duck. There's still Krauts everywhere. Ready? Move out. Yeah, come on. So you're the guys they told us about. You guys are crazy. Yeah. Alright, let's move out. Go, go, go. Look at me. We'll be alright. Alright? Get down! Get down! Get ready to run to that wall. Wait till I call. Okay, go! Get down! Get down! - Grenade! - Go, go, go! - Get down! - Aah! Go, go, go, go! Uh, come on. Panzer! Panzer! - Move out! - Get up! Move! - Let's go. - Whoo! Move! Move! Move! - Aah! - Move out! Roll, roll, roll! No, uh.. Uh, that's Amaldi's. Upper floor. Behind me. We got to go. - Go, go. - Yeah? - Wait, get back. - Yeah! Let's go. Go! Go! Shit. Gracias. Halt! You okay? You're good, come on. Hold position! It looks like we've got the city up past the Vatican. The Germans have pulled back their rearguard. - Alright, alright. - Thank you. You'll be fine, buddy. They don't have it, they're still building carbon molding frames instead of shaped housings. He's writing about heavy water absorption rates. This letter, he asks Amaldi for help with casement tolerances. Here, he says he's doing large-structure analysis. Everything points to a reactor instead of a bomb. How do we know these documents aren't decoys? Plants? Uh, they're letters. Personal letters. These men are friends. The physics is, uh, intertwined with the intimacy. Hmm, we have to be sure. Then have the British review it. They are physicists. They will confirm what I say. Alright. We'll have the Brits weigh in. Donovan will be here soon. I'm kicking this upstairs. - Mr. Berg. - Hello, sir. - How's it been going? - Going well. Yes, sir. And the industrial complex at Hechingen has only a containment vessel and a cycle stack both signs of a nascent reactor facility. And the uranium separation facility? Consensus in London is that's just a carbon separator of some sort. An attempt at shale extraction. - Coal? - Apparently so. I concur. So, where does this leave us? London is certain. No German bomb. Degree of certainty? There's no such thing as a degree of certainty. I mean, something is either certain or it is not. Hmm. Thank you, gentlemen. - Good day, sir. - Good day. So, what are the alternatives? Bombing Hechingen is unlikely to be effective. If they are developing a bomb the work, the materials will be spread out at facilities and other factories. So our British allies tell us 100 % no German bomb. My people tell me a 20 % possibility. More likely ten or five percent. - Perhaps less. - But not zero. It's Probability 101. You multiply the likelihood of the event by the consequence. Five percent chance you're going to stub your toe in the dark you take the chance, walk to the bathroom without turning on the lights and waking your wife. A five percent chance of losing the war to a weapon like this you do what has to be done. Which is? We kill Heisenberg. What if he's on our side? Why is it that the Germans haven't developed a bomb? Heisenberg has a team of at least a dozen capable physicists. What have they been doing? What are you saying? He's dragging his feet? Intentionally slowing the program? I do not think that Werner Heisenberg would want to be remembered as a traitor. The man who lost the war for Germany? We are not absolutely sure of that nor do we have any actual evidence that he's secretly working for us. There are millions of lives at stake. I'm sorry. Werner Heisenberg.. Pioneer in the study of subatomic particles. Winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in physics for the creation of quantum mechanics. Equation 56 is known as Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty. The principle shows that one can never observe both the position and velocity of a particle at the same time. One cannot be certain where something is and where it is going. And thus, Heisenberg proves that no one knows anything. We live in eternal uncertainty. A man after my own heart. You like libraries. Why? Here is a belongingness I find in few other places. On a ball field? There too. That's gone now. I have to ask you a question and I need a real answer. If it comes down to it are you going to be able to kill him? Yes. There you go. You wanna play? Huh, good. You, uh, got a choice? - Catcher? - It's all yours. Oh, shit. - The guy's a pro. - Yeah. I know who that is. That's Moe Berg. Home plate, home plate! - Yes! - Alright. Uh-oh. Move back, move back. Don't worry, 245 lifetime. Yeah, yeah, just don't hit it down my throat, okay? Oh! That's a hit! Jesus Christ! Moe Berg, thanks. Oh, no. Don't thank me. Thank you. Hey, do you mind, uh, signing the ball? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks a lot, Moe. You know, I saw you a dozen times at Fenway. - You were great. - Me? Great? When? Uh, well, I saw you. - Yeah. - Thanks. Zurich. It's a short train journey from Hechingen. A break from the grim atmosphere of Germany. He will be tempted. And I know someone in Zurich. Paul Scherrer. He and Heisenberg are good friends. - They play chess by mail. - He's anti-Nazi. Exactly, but he and Heisenberg are still close. And he gonna help us lure Heisenberg to Zurich? Such a word, "Lure." Heisenberg has been there twice since the war started. We simply have Scherrer invite him to deliver a lecture. Can Scherrer be persuaded to work with us? Yes. Scherrer will arrange it. And so the madness becomes real. We have to kill Werner Heisenberg and I am to be a part of it. No one wants to kill Heisenberg. Yeah? Then kidnap him. Send in spies to Germany and kidnap him. You've read too many spy novels. I've never read a spy novel. It's not that easy to kidnap somebody. Ah. Yeah, you mean killing is easier. My God. You'll have about 30 miles on foot to the Swiss border. I'd hold on to your gun. I have some reservations about your guides. Reservations? Like what? Reservations like they might kill you. You might have cared to add that to the report. There's your guides. Wish me luck. I don't wanna hear you depending on luck. Figure of speech. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Moe. Now we rest. Riposo. No. - Hi, are you okay? - Yeah. Who came up with that sheep nonsense? - I don't know. - I felt like an idiot. So did I. Switzerland? Yes. Let's go. That's Heisenberg. It's good to see you.. And that's Professor Scherrer. Scherrer looks way to nervous. I guess this isn't his thing. What? Treachery. - Professor Scherrer. - Mr. Aziz, please come in. Thank you. My name's Berg. Oh, so who is Mr. Aziz? A cover name. I prefer you and I tell each other the truth. I'm Morris Berg. Oh. Sam Goudsmit sends his regards. Ah, well. I was hoping he would come here personally. Please, please sit down. Well, he, uh.. He sent you something. Heavy water. Nordstemmen impurity. Oh, thank you so much. No, you don't know how much I appreciate this. Thank you so much. You don't worry I give this to the Germans? We trust you, professor. I may be mistaken, but.. I don't think Professor Heisenberg will reveal anything in his lecture. Hmm. Well, then perhaps I could speak with him privately. Are you hoping he'll defect? Yes, I am. Good luck. Excuse me one moment. Got to listen carefully. There may be one moment that tells you whether the Germans have a chance at a fission bomb or not. One moment, and you'll learn all you need to know. You understand me, catcher? I understand you. In that moment, without hesitation you will shoot Heisenberg dead on the spot. Did he accept your dinner invitation? I prevailed upon our friendship. He'll be there. Good. What if he doesn't tell you what you want to know? I'll do my best to be persuasive. There's always a possibility that you will learn nothing. But at least we will have tried. Mr. Berg.. Is there something you're not telling me? No. Do you plan to kill Professor Heisenberg? I have no intention whatsoever. One last thing. Heisenberg will have undercover Gestapo agents watching him and you can't allow yourself to be captured. I don't know what God you believe in, Berg, if any. But I'll be asking mine to keep an eye on you. Your call is being connected, sir. Let me know if there's a problem. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi, Estella. Morris? Are you alright? I am. Where are you? Uh, I can't say. And I don't have much time. But I wanted to call and.. I wanted to hear your voice. I'm here, Moe. I have to go. I love you. Thank you. Who is that, Paul? I saw him at the lecture. What's he doing here? Yeah, he's a good friend of mine. I think you'll find him very engaging. You know he carries a gun. Yeah. No need to worry. Let's eat. I just don't understand how you could have stayed in Germany. Oh, please, no politics. No war. There is a war, whether you like it or not. What are you suggesting? I like the war? I am suggesting that unlike many of your colleagues you elected to stay in Nazi Germany. I elected to stay in Germany, which happens to be Nazi. Do I hear politics from that end of the table? One hears what one wishes to hear. Please, we are all friends. Let's talk about old times, or better times to come. Yes, please. Aziz? Aziz. I understand we have a bad weather tomorrow. Rain. There is no avoiding political matters. We can try. Is that what you've been doing as the head of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Heereswaffenamt? I beg of you, we are completely separate from politics. Oh, I forgot. The citizens of the world, yes? Once, and hopefully again someday. Tell that to the Poles, and the Danes the Belgians, the Jews. Please, I'm not a military man. We don't know what sort of man you are. Yes, we do. He's the kind of man who is helping the Nazis fight their war. Building Hitler's super weapon. See? He doesn't even deny it. I feel the war will be over soon. Maybe. - And Germany will lose. - Whatever you say. You disgust me. Please, please, please. Professor Heisenberg is my guest. Well, then the two of you can lament Germany's loss together. Ugh! Please forgive me. Werner, please stay. I really must go. I've endured enough of this. Do I have a choice? Yes, of course. Should I run, perhaps? I wouldn't recommend it. We must finish our game. I believe it's your move, professor. - Knight takes rook. - Bishop takes bishop. Pawn takes knight. And so, in three exchanges only my king will survive. It seems to me this game is nearly over. I cannot mount an attack with my king. So it is over. Who are you? A student. A student? Really? A student of what? Of you. I see. Now, how are we supposed to ascertain the truth here Mr. Berg? Will Germany lose the war? Is this really a secret? I'll ask him myself. I think you mean, am I a traitor? Is that what you wish to know? And if I think he's lying.. ...then I'll kill him. Like me.. ...you are free to choose. Your move. Goodnight, Professor Heisenberg. What did you say your name was? I didn't.
