♫ I got some money in my pocket ♫ I got the car keys in my hand ♫ I got myself a couple of tickets... ♫ Hey. ♫ Come on, babe, you know there ain't no time ♫ To mess around, round, round ♫ Evie, Evie ♫ Evie, let your hair hang down ♫ Evie, Evie ♫ Evie, let your hair hang down ♫ Evie, Evie ♫ Evie, let your hair hang down ♫ Evie, Evie ♫ Let your hair hang... ♫ Hello! Bring him in. Bring him in. Through here. Just get him in. Alright, uh... - OK, sit down. - OK, OK. Hold his head! You have to keep his bloody head still! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, you! We've gotta get a clean... Uh, no... Yeah, no worries. What is his beef, huh? It doesn't matter. I can't do it anyway. I can't shoot a mate. What can I get you, mate? Uh, just a beer, thanks. So, what's wrong with the dog? Oh, baited strychnine. Why would anyone want to poison a dog? Maybe someone set it out for the roos or the dingoes or someone just doesn't like dogs, you know? There are people, sick people. Sorry. Are you his master? No, no. He has no master. Well, not now. That's not just any dog in there, you know? - No? - Oh, no, no. No, no, he's a famous dog. He's probably the most famous dog in all Australia. Red Dog. Yeah, the one that warned those people about that fire. No, no, no. The one that saved that child... No, no, not him. Wrong dog. - Didn't he... - No, no, no, no. Look, mate, you're looking at it all the wrong way. It's, uh... it's not what he did. It's who he was. 'Is', I mean. Red Dog? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Vet's coming. - Yeah? When? - Soon. How's the poor thing doing? Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Jack Collins, publican. Thomas Baker, trucker. Yeah, yeah. It was me that brought Red Dog to Dampier, me and Maureen... near on 10 years ago now, back in the mean old days when men were men and dogs were... dogs, rougher, hotter, brighter, redder... Why would anybody build a town out here? Why would anyone live in a town built out here? Iron ore. Money. Yeah, I know that. - What's that? - What's what? On the road. It's a dog. I can see that. What's it doing out here? Hello, boy! Hey? Hello. Hello. Aren't you a pretty boy, hey? Hello. Are you lost? Do you need water? Cheeky bastard. Struth! Is that the dog? Well, it's certainly not me! Eugh! Ohh! Oh, Lord, what did that thing eat? Stop the car! I can't breathe! Ohh! Eugh! Oh... Oh, this is like... Wow. Ohh! WESTERN AUSTRALIA 1971 Ohh! Hey, Maureen, Maureen. Come and have a look at this. Oh, that poor little bugger. Oh! Oh, g'day, Rick. He's out the back, mate. - Righto. Thanks. - Hey, Rick. That's the vet. Here you go, Vanno. - Hey. - Vanno, this is Tommy boy. I've just been telling him about Red Dog. Vanno here's one of his first mates from back in the days. Yes, 'the days'. Wild days? Very wild, very lonely. A dog of a certain type can do well in a lonely town. I know. I come from a small little village in Italy, Abruzzi. Here we go. Ohh! Yes, yes, you all bloat, but my little village was beautiful. In spring, flowers are like Turkish carpet and the wine would make you see the Virgin. Why did you leave? Same as all these fools, money! We all follow the money. They come from everywhere. From all the countries, they come for the money, for the work. From Poland, New Zealand, Ireland, Greece, Latvia, America. Even Melbourne. Living together, eating together and crapping together. Money crackpot They may look normal, but not normal. Sun has burned out their brains. See, I know sun in Italy, in Abruzzi, but I not know the sun until I come here. Very dangerous, this sun. I knew a man, Goran. Remember Goran? The Sun, it kill him. And also Sam. Remember Sam-Man? He work in the sun for five hours without no hat. Fool! Afterward he spoke Chinese for two days. Before the sun, he know not a word of Chinese! Yes, it was crazy place when Red Dog arrive in Dampier. Men are no better than wild animals. They drink much and they... How do you say? 'Imbulge'. And their hair, it goes funny. ♫ All day, all night ♫ You know, I've been working hard ♫ All day, all night ♫ Gather around, y'all it's about time you learnt ♫ About the new dance craze that's sweeping the world... ♫ If that thing could flap... ...it might just fly away. You two... be needing an ed-u-cation. A what? Arggh! Ohh! Though not all imbulge. Some were quiet, educated, with dark, mysterious past. Some that never, ever laugh. In Abruzzi, no-one would fight over moustache. What do they fight over? Women! Abruzzi has the most beautiful women in Italy. Slender, with a wonderful breast, like a nut. Nuts? Yes! Big, beautiful nut! To come from a place with such beautiful women to a place with no women... I don't think you can understand such pain. In Abruzzi, the sky is very blue, THE "SKI" PATROL like, uh... ...like the sky of Abruzzi. If he mentions that stupid town one more time I'll stick him like a pig. I will help. For national unity. In Abruzzi, the sea... Arggh. Oi! Oi! Barry Wright to main office, please. Barry Wright. We took a vote, and the shop steward agrees. If you don't stop talking about 'Bruzki'... Abruzzi! ...the Ski Patrol have permission to slit your throat. Sorry. Everyone's homesick. Not you? Need a home to be homesick, mate. You alone too, Mr. Doggie? But you are happy, no? You have a gift, Mr. Doggie. I do not. Have you ever heard of Abruzzi? Abruzzi has the best fishing in Italy... ♫ Oh, baby, don't you know that I love you so? ♫ Bom, bom, bom, bom - ♫ Baby, don't you know - ♫ Bom, bom, bom, bom - ♫ That I love you so? - ♫ Bom, bom... ♫ What can I say? He was an excellent listener. He did not judge. A polite doggie, a very loyal doggie. Or so I thought. ♫ Bom, bom, bom, bom ♫ Baby, can't you see... - ♫ That you were meant for me? - ♫ Bom, bom... ♫ Betrayal! Hey! - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Are you talking to my dog? - Your dog? - How is he your dog? - I talk to him first. That doesn't make him your dog, mate. That just makes you weird. If I am weird then you are more weird. - Not likely. - I feed him steak! Well, what do you think I'm feeding him? Broccoli? Dog robber. Alright, then. Why don't we let him decide? Good. Let him decide! Whose doggie are you? Give us a kiss. Good boy! How you going? Oh, you're a good boy, Red Dog. You little Red Dog, aren't ya? Aren't ya a good boy? He was like that... a dog for everyone. Come here, boy! Come here, boy. Here, Red. Here. Good boy! Come here. Yes, for everyone, but no-one in particular. All those in favour of Red Dog joining the TWU under the job heading con... consu... - Consulari. - Whatever. All those in favour, say "Aye." Aye. Yes, a union doggie, a doggie for all. That is, until he met his true master. - Johnny! - Yeah, Johnny! - Johnny boy! - Johnny Boy! ♫ Now listen ♫ Oh, we're stepping out ♫ I'm gonna turn around ♫ Gonna turn around once and we'll do the Eagle Rock ♫ Whoa, mamma ♫ Oh, your rocking swell ♫ Hmm, yeah, you do it so well ♫ Well, we do it so well when we do the Eagle Rock ♫ Mamma, oh! ♫ Yeah, you're rocking fine ♫ Why don't you give me a sign? ♫ Hmm, just give me a sign and we'll do the Eagle Rock ♫ Hey, hey, hey ♫ Good old Eagle Rock's here to stay ♫ I'm just crazy 'bout the way we move ♫ Doing the Eagle Rock... ♫ Good morning.

Why wouldn't he eat a chicken? Alive chicken! Enough! I won't let Red Dog eat alive chicken for your sick amusement. What's it to you, huh? It's not your dog. No chicken, mate. - Says who? - I do. Ooh! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! OK, OK! No chicken, no chicken. Red Dog, come! Huh? Come on, boy. We ride together now. And from that day on Red Dog had a master... the only master he would ever have. Hey, but enough said about that. Hey, quiet! Quiet! Shh! Turn the jukebox off. Uh... to tell you the truth, I should put him down. But he's a strong old dog and God knows he deserves a last fight so I've given him some anticonvulsants, he's resting easier. We wait. Hopefully, he'll make it through the night. Come on, Red Dog. Poor Red. What are we gonna do with you, huh? - A shame, that is. - Yeah. There's a lot of history there, you know, with Nancy, John, Red Dog. Down! Bad dog! You'll never get him out of there, Miss. No-one sit there when Red sit there. Ohh! Well, aren't you a charmer, huh? Stop that! Bad dog! Hang on, Miss. Hang on! Ever since he became a union member he thinks he's got rights. I'm not moving, so you'll just have to put up with me. Stop that! Now, be a gentleman and move over! - Now! - Ooh. - Hello. - Hello. You're sharing a seat with my dog. Yes, I am. Wow. So, what will you be doing at Hamersley, Nancy? A secretary. Quite a change from Perth. An adventure, to be sure. That's a good way to look at it, an adventure. - Is alright yet? - Don't wanna be too late. Give it another minute or two to air out, boys. Wouldn't want anyone to get sick from the fumes. So, Nancy, there's a new movie playing at the open-air. Would you like to come and see it? What's it about? Uh, I can't remember. Alright, then. - Still 'rip'. - 'Ripe'? Yes, the rip is very ripe. Oh, yeah? Hi, John. Uh, I need to borrow the wagon so I can take the new girl to the movies. What makes you think that she'd be interested in a skinny little Yank like you when she's got us proper blokes around? I bathe. Also, do you think you could watch Red? I think he's a touch... J-E-A-L-O-U-S. J-E-what? - Jealous. - Oh! Huh? Pfft! No troubles. We'll have a right party, we will. - Won't we, Red? - Thanks, Peet. See ya, Red. Get ready to get wild. ♫ Jeepers, creepers ♫ Where'd you get those peepers? ♫ Jeepers, creepers ♫ Where'd you get those eyes? ♫ This one's a beauty. It's called the fisherman's rib. Lovely, don't you think? You play your cards right and I can make you a sweater with four legs. ♫ Love is me ♫ Got to put my cheaters on Jeepers, creepers... ♫ Where do you think you're going? Ohh... Yo! We're going to the pub. I can't... I'm watching Red Dog for Johnny boy. What is in his mouth? Hey! Give me that. Bring back my bloody yarn! Red! Red! Hello, kitty. Whoa. Hey, hey. Go on, take off. Red Cat was an horrendous animal, no? He was... how do you say? A destroyer of many pooches. Hey, what are you doing to my cat? Nothing. I... What's going on? Oh, this cat tried to attack me. It must smell Red Dog on me. Visitors have to park on the road. It's a rule. Sorry, Mr. Cribbage. Rules are rules, Miss Grey. With all the riffraff the company's hiring it's only rules that separate us from the animals. Goodnight, Mr. Cribbage. He's the caretaker of the park. I'm trying not to get on his bad side. Does he have a good side? - There you are. - Thank you. Turn your bloody lights off, ya nongs! Shh! Oh, geez! Ohh! Oi! I can't see! What the hell is that? Hide, it's my dog. Ohh! You, dog, be needing an ed-u-cation. Hey, can I show you something? Careful. So a few years back, this old dude, Jumbo Smelt, was swimming right out there and he got attacked by a great white. Bit him in the leg and pulled him under. - Did he die? - No, no. The shark spat him out, didn't like the way he tasted. Not a surprise if you knew Jumbo. It took 73 stitches to get his leg sewed back together. That's awful. Hey, no-one swims out there anymore. Most days you can still see the shark swimming back and forth. He's been spotted so often the boys have given him a name. - Mmm? - Lord Nelson. I don't see anything. Maybe we should go out a bit deeper. - What's that? - What?! - Nothing. - It's not funny! Maybe he's asleep. Sharks don't sleep. They have to keep moving, just like you, Mister Never Lived More Than Two Years in the Same Place. - Are you calling me a shark? - Maybe. Nah, you got me wrong. Moving is part of my romantic nature. Hmm. You're just scared. Scared? Of what? Of finding something worth staying in one place for. ♫ I left the keys in the car ♫ I left the door ajar ♫ I didn't want to be alone ♫ These are the days and the nights ♫ At these sweet humbling heights ♫ And I know it used to be home... ♫ ♫ Well, whisk me away I'll be yours for a day ♫ In heavenly fields we can roam... ♫ ♫ Whoa, oh, oh You're my clean white love ♫ What are you doing?

Red Dog is reason I met my most bella wife. Do you remember? It was the day Red Dog was shot. - Red Dog was shot? - Oh, yes. After his first great tight with Red Cat. - Why would anyone shoot him? - Because he won. No, he did not win his first fight with Red Cat, but Red Dog was not a normal poochie. He was smart, very, very smart, and brave. Get out! Get! You dirty, filthy, whoring hound! - Johnny boy! - Yeah? Phone. Hello. He's over here! Hey, buddy. Hey. Oh, what have they done to you? Ohh. What do you think? I can stop the bleeding, but we have to get him to a vet. That's four hours. Three and a half, mate, the way I drive. Don't you dare die on me, you damn dog. Don't you dare die. You're OK. So, who do you think did it? Evil cribbages. They live on pig shouts and they hate the doggies. What makes you think he has a rifle? - I know. - How do you know that? After Jumbo Smelt was eaten in the leg all the men with gun... ...went out to kill the sharky. I'm glad they didn't kill it. Why? You never know when you might need a shark. What in God's red earth would you need a shark for? Say you woke up one fine morning and didn't find it so fine. Being eaten by a shark is rather a memorable way to go. You would not talk this way if you laugh once in a while. I laugh. - Never. - He's right, mate. I've never even heard you chuckle. Maybe you haven't noticed, but Dampier's no three-ring bloody circus, is it? In my home village of Abruzzi there was always laughter, always. I don't even think there is an Abruzzi. You probably come from some piss-ugly town in Albania and are trying to pass. Vannoski! That is not funny. Yuri Vannoski. Dimitri Vannoski. Knitter. - What did you call me? - I called you a knitter! What kind of a man knits a sweater? Shut up! Give Red Dog some peace, for Godsakes! It'S OK. It'll be OK. Well, he got lucky. The bullets missed the bone. I saved them for you. Well, look at that. - How long will he need to stay? - Just a couple of hours. It's my shout, boys. You alright? Red's gonna need to come back in two weeks. - That's a long bloody drive. - Yeah. I could try and take the stitches out for you. No. I will take him. It would be an honour. 2 WEEKS LATER Idiota, idiota, idiota! 3 WEEKS LATER His nose, it is, uh, very dry. I cannot sleep. 4 WEEKS LATER Yes, a worm. A big white worm. 5 WEEKS LATER I am sorry they give you enema last time. This time I promise to ask her out. OK, OK, OK. I ask her out and give you big meat, huh? No. After. I can't see any glass. I wonder, you know, sometime, I and you together maybe... Are you asking me out? I do. Arggh! Well? Yes, I, Vincenzio Alberto Girolomo, ask you, bella Rosa, out. A round of drinks on me for my bella Rosa, my bello child Giovanni and Red Dog. He saved my life once. True. Yeah? How did he do that? Everyone that ends up in this part of the country has something they're running away from. Hang on. Lack of money, broken heart, violent acts, loss of hope. We all have a story we left behind. 10 years ago, my wife and girl were killed in an auto accident when I was driving. Oh, Jesus,I... I'm sorry. What Vanno said was true. I... I hadn't laughed in years. Then one fine morning I woke up and I didn't find it so fine. Oh, g'day, Jumbo. Couldn't stand a drink for me poor nerves and me throbbing scar, could you? No worries, Jumbo. Throbbing something horrible all night. And what do I hear this morning? Me old nemesis, Lord Nelson, is back off Hansen's Cove, swimming back and forth, carefree as a kiss. Huh. I feel like Captain bloody Hook. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Hey, mate, can you grab us a cold one out of the esky? Oh, g'day, mate. Get it! Where are you, you lazy-arse fish? - Hey, get out of it, you mongrel! - That's my steak! Drop that steak! - Jocko! - Get out! Shark! - Faster! - Get in, Jocko! Ah! Do you want to die? Get rid of the steak! Get in! You alright? Wasn't for Red Dog and that prime hunk of red meat, you'd be looking at fish bait. Hello? Oh, uh. Wait. Wait a second. Uh... A gentleman. Four sisters. Ah. Well... Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry. Yeah. So, whatever happened to them? - Who? - Nancy and John. Uno, dos, one, two, tres, cuatro. Up, up, Up, Up. Yeah! Not that song! Hey. Excuse me, guys. Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go. Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! - Speech! - No. No, no, no, no, no. What do you think I'm standing up here for, the weather? - How's the weather? - Hot! Now, most of you blokes have no idea what we're celebrating here tonight. You heard there was free beer and food and you came swarming out of the night like locusts. He's not a bad bloke for a seppo. But I'm here to tell you there's something deeper going on here tonight. We're celebrating a unique moment in my life. - Sedentariness. - Did he say he was on drugs? Nah, I think he's joining the priesthood. Now, I've been in Dampier two years and one day. That is one day longer than I've ever been in any single place my whole life. - Why, you ask? Why? Why? - Why? Why in this glorious armpit of the North-West? One reason. One incredibly beautiful reason. I am hopelessly in love with Nancy Grey, and I am not afraid to tell the world about it, or her. Uh... Huh. Nancy Jane Grey... ...will you marry me? John Grant... ...I Will! Now, go home! - Lovely party. - Mmm. I think we should go to my place. Or we could just go into my bed. Which two of your mates are passed out in. Red Dog, you stay. You hear me? I'll be back in the morning. Go back to sleep, beautiful. I'll see you tonight, OK? Hello? Oh, hello, Nancy. It's Jocko. Hello, Jocko. How's your head? What head? Some joker's replaced it with a swollen pumpkin. - Have you seen John? - Why? Well, he never showed up for work. He left my place early to go back to his house. He probably went back to sleep, is all. I'll... it's nearly lunch. I'll pop over and take a peek. - Call me when you find him. - It will do. - See that? - What? Turn around. Slow down. Here! Oh! No. Oh! With all the sadness and the... ...arrangements for the funeral, everyone forgot about Red Dog. Wasn't till three days had passed that anyone noticed that... ...he was still waiting outside John's house. Nancy made an effort to claim him, but... ...he was a one-master dog. So he waited. In the heat and the cold, day and night. For three weeks, he sat in front of John's house and barely moved, his eyes always on the road. Then one day, Red Dog made a decision. If John wasn't gonna come home, then he, Red Dog, would go out in the world and find John. Walked in the transport... and looked into the face... of every man there. He was asking a single question. "Have you seen John?" "Have you seen John?" "Have you seen John?" "Have you seen John?" He looked everywhere at Hamersley. Every department. And when he couldn't find him there, he went to the saltworks. And then the mall. And then the pub. And even the harbour. Most dogs would have stopped there, in Dampier. But most dogs weren't Red Dog. And this is how he became famous. This is how he became the Pilbara Wanderer, Dog of the North-West. You see, mate... ...he went everywhere. He travelled for years. Town to town to town. He was spotted down in Perth more than once and as far north as Darwin. And I have it on good authority that he even hitched a ride on an ore ship from Port Hedland to Saganoseki, Japan. But in the end, after all the looking and the travelling... ...the grief... ...I think he finally knew. It was time. Time to come home. Red? Red? Red Dog! Red! Red Dog! Hello! Red Dog. Red Dog! You came back! Did you hear? I got a promotion. I'm an executive assistant now. Which is really the same as a secretary except I get paid a bit more. They've put me on the list for one of the new houses at Karratha. Oh. And I finally let that Kurt bloke take me out. I don't think so. Bad dental hygiene. Shh. Hello. - Miss Grey. - Mmm. Its come to our attention that you're in serious violation of park rules. - And what would they be? - You know what. - No dogs allowed! - It's a silly rule. We know you have a dog in there. No point in denying. Red Dog is not your average dog, Mr. Cribbage. He has privileges. Everybody knows that. I don't care if he's the Queen's bloody corgi. If you don't get rid of him, we get rid of you. Aha! Red, stop that. Your contract clearly states that you cannot own a dog. I don't own Red Dog. Nobody does. - Then he's a stray. - No. He's common. What the heck's common? He's accepted and cared for by the town. The community. Now, there's a laugh. That's no proper town. And there's no such community. It's just a bunch of dirty miners working, drinking and whoring. What happens in this park is what I say. And I say that dog is a dangerous stray, plain and simple. And the next time I see him, I'll shoot him for sure. Listen to me, you little bug. You as much as harm a hair on that dog's head and you will have me and the entire Pilbara to answer to! You've been warned, Miss Grey. And so have you. Now, once more. ♫ We can't be beaten ♫ What'll we tell 'em, boys? ♫ We can't be beaten ♫ There comes a time when every man must fight ♫ When he believes in justice and right ♫ He'll take so much till he'll take no more ♫ They'll hear us coming when they hear the mighty roar ♫ Shoulder to shoulder, we're gonna stand ♫ We're gonna fight to the very last man... ♫ Who was it? Everyone. Stop that! Who are all you people? Well, they would be the community of Dampier. But since there is no proper town and no such community, I guess they're just a bunch of dirty, drunken miners. - Yeah! - That's right. Dirty, drunken. I'll call the police, I will. There's no need, Mr. Cribbage. Back here. Get these people out of my park! Now, Mr. Cribbage, you're just the caretaker. - Hamersley owns the land. - So what? I take care of the land. You got a problem with that? What do you all want with me? Oh, we just have a small delegation that would like to have a private word with you. That's all. Oh, whoops. Seems to be my break time. Call me if you need me. - We had a little chat. - Yeah. - It was very civilised and all. - You were very persuasive. It was nothing, really. All the Cribbages needed was a bit of ed-u-cation. Well, they were so educated that they ran away and took their caravan with them. The only thing they left behind... ...was their cat. So as Red Dog would never be accused of being a low-down dirty stray again, we all had him registered at the shire as common. Ohh... But... ...there was a reckoning still to be decided. The Cribbages were gone, true, but let us not forget that a dark, sinister force still ruled over the caravan park. Good versus evil! Civilisation versus chaos! Doggie do versus cat poo! Red Dog and Red Cat are going at it! Place your bets, gents! They fight! They fight! What? Spectacular. Nobody knows how or why. Perhaps it was a grudging respect. Certainly, they were the scrappiest and the rangiest their two kinds have ever cooked up. Perhaps they saw more than a bit of themselves in each other. Who knows? But know this. Mates, they became. - Red Cat and Red Dog. - Red Cat and Red Dog. Shh, shh, shh. There's an iron statue outside brought up from Perth by this fine man, Thomas, here. It's of that old English explorer William Dampier. Paid for, as in all things, by Hamersley Iron... ...to stand at the entrance of this town. Dampier sailed into the harbour in 16-something-or-other, spent five minutes, sailed out again. The only thing he wrote about the place was, "Too many flies." That's it! "Too many flies"! Well, I say, to hell with that! Why should we have a statue honouring a poncy Pommy fly-hating aristocrat? Or, for that matter, a fat bloody general, or, God help us, a stinkin' politician? Yeah! We should have somebody that understands this place. Somebody that lives and breathes this vastness and desolation. Somebody that's got red dust stuck up their nose and in their eyes and their hair and up their arse! Somebody that's like all of us. Men... and women... who understand the meaning of independence and the importance of a generous heart. Mates who are loyal by nature, not design... ...and who know the meaning of love and loss. Somebody that represents our home. Somebody that represents the Pilbara in all of us. And I say that somebody... ...dammit... ...is a dog! Guess whose shout. ♫ Way out west ♫ Where the rain don't fall ♫ Got a job with the company digging for ore ♫ Just to make some bread ♫ Living and a-working on the land ♫ Quit my job and I left my wife ♫ I headed out west for a brand-new life ♫ Just to get away ♫ Living and a-working on the land... ♫ Yeah! ♫ What a change it's been ♫ From working that nine-to-five ♫ How strange it's been ♫ At last I get the feeling that I'm really alive ♫ Way out west, where the rain don't fall ♫ Got a job with a company drilling for oil ♫ And I'm never gonna leave ♫ Living and a-working on the land ♫ La-la-la-la-la-la-la ♫ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ♫ Living and a-working on the land ♫ La-la-la-la-la-la-la ♫ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... ♫ - Whoo! - Yeah! ♫ Living and a-working on the land ♫ Hey! To Red Dog! The best damn doggie in the whole damn country! - Hey. Hey. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. He's gone. No, no. He's gone from the room. He's not out the back anymore. We have to find him. Come on. Let's go. - Red Dog! - Red! Red! Red! Doggie! Red Doggie! Red! Doggie! Red! Here, Red! Here, boy! Red! Red! Where are you, boy? Red! Red Dog, come home. They've found him. You stay, boy. You stay here. You're home now. ONE YEAR LATER ♫ When people keep repeating ♫ That you'll never fall in love ♫ When everybody keeps retreating ♫ But you can't seem to get enough ♫ Let my love open the door... ♫ Oh, my God! ♫ Let my love open the door... ♫ - Where'd you get him? - Vanno was giving them away. - ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ Ooh-ooh ♫ Let my love open the door ♫ When everything feels all over ♫ Everybody seems unkind... ♫ Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please take a seat. ♫ Take all worry out of your mind ♫ Let my love open the door ♫ Let my love open the door... ♫ ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ To your heart - ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ Ooh-ooh - ♫ Let my love open the door ♫ Ooh-ooh ♫ I have the only key to your heart ♫ I can stop you falling apart ♫ Try today You'll End this way ♫ Come on and give me a chance to say ♫ Let my love open the door ♫ It's all I'm living for ♫ Release yourself from misery ♫ There's only one thing gonna set you free ♫ That's my love ♫ That's my love - ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ Ooh ♫ Let my love open the door - ♫ When tragedy befalls you - ♫ Ooh-ooh ♫ Don't let it drag you down - ♫ Love can cure your problem - ♫ Ooh-ooh ♫ You're so lucky I'm around ♫ Let my love open the door ♫ To your heart ♫ Red Dog died on November 21st, 1979.
