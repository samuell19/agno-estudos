Oh, hello, are you here too? Oh yes, you don't want to miss out. Do you, you lovely animal? Yes, yes... I like to think that when I got them really friendly, they'll come up to me to get their back scratched, rather than me having to go to them. So obviously, I've achieved that with this lady. Ooh, no, no... We don't want to... You want a bit of it, too, don't you? Film stars everywhere. I'm sure that's all the footage you can possibly use. Oh, you're lovely, aren't youse? As you've probably discovered, I like cows. Oh! I know! You're not getting enough, are you? "Monday 24th of February, 2020. Wind easterly, force one, wet. Filming on the beach. Cloe the cow very cooperative. Also a day of the cold bath treatment. I was filmed having a cold bath." When we were children, Father used to take us swimming every morning. We used to all have a dip in the sea. And this may be something to do with the reason why all my life I've had a cold bath in the morning. My father, William Ivan Lawrence MacEwen, to give him his full name, came to Muck in 1922. He was trained for a career in the Royal Navy, but after the First World War they were cutting back on ships, and he was offered a bounty to leave. At the same time he inherited Muck from his uncle, who, in turn, had bought it in 1896. Father had no experience of farming, but he went to Agricultural College and soon came to the island. It's good because it's calm. It's so much easier to see sea birds on the water if it's calm. The biggest cave on the island goes in, uh, not in this one, but just around the corner. Maybe I'm shouting too loud. I'll scare the puffins off. I better shut up. Do you have children here? Six grandchildren, on the island. I've got a daughter that has the hotel, and a son who runs the farm. If Ronnie had slowed down more I could have talked more but... Ah, we love Lawrence! No, but I have a yearn to be a tourist guide. The people were latching onto you. They certainly were. I hope so. "Who is this guy?" Yes, yes. "Monday 9th of March, 1964. Light airs and light to moderate, north-easterly. Lawrence to Mallaig for 35, red three-cylinder Ferguson tractor." "April 1967. The telephone reached Gallanach by underground cable. It was the first time a telephone had reached the farmhouse." Diaries were always part of the family, and in the early days, my father was the one that kept it. In this first copy, in 1963, it was him that recorded the events. On the 2nd of August, 1963, he has recorded: "Weather north, light airs, later calm. All route for Ben Nevis. We decide to climb Scotland's highest mountain." It is also recorded that I climbed barefoot. When we were young, there was only three children on the island, and we roamed everywhere, including this point. We always did it barefoot, in summer, so our feet got very hard, and we could stand the pain of walking on sharp objects. My elder brother, Alastair, was two years older than me. He was the one that made sure we didn't get into trouble. But he didn't want to stay on the island, so he was willing to hand the island over to me. And... At first, I was very nervous about the responsibility of running it. Go round, round there, Hugh. Papa, you go to the gate. - Papa, you go to the gate. - Oh, right. Wait, Hugh. Wait. We'll get them back. Its Mummy's that way. Stop it, Hugh! Stop it. Right, push up. Come on, over there, you silly animal! - All good. - Yes! - All good. - Yes! - Yes! - High five. Yes! High five. Yes! Finally! Cattle want to be in a herd, and these two seem to have decided that they want to be with the others, so I suspect they'll just jump over the fence. - Again? - Again, yes. "Thursday 31st of July, 1980. Dry, wind southeast, moderate. On the farm silage is being cut. But Lawrence left for Inverness first thing, where he arrived after the birth of son, Colin. Colin weighed a healthy ten and three-quarter pounds." "18th July, 1986. West to northwest, odd light shower. Colin, aged 5, dragged a gas cylinder most of the way home from Camus Mor. We were all amazed." This is Gallanach farmhouse, where we used to live. But eleven years ago, my son and daughter-in-law came home to take over the farm, and we moved to this house next-door. And this is where we stay now, it's called Tailachlen. It's quite small. Hello, Lawrence. Good afternoon, Tom, nice to see you. Great to be here on a day like today. It certainly is. - What a view! - Well, even I never tire of it. Even when the weather's not quite as good as it is today. Is that what makes you stay here? Well, just one of the reasons. Your family have been very persistent, in that the island has been in the same hands for over 80 years, namely, the MacEwen hands. And many, many people have given up with less cause, you know, than you; you managed to carry on. Yes, but I think it's a great challenge, and I have marvelous people with me on the island, and I think that working together has been a real privilege. I think the important thing is, that if you have growth it should be gradual and slow. You mustn't have sudden changes. There's been... Even here there's been enough, plenty of changes in the last ten, fifteen years. The change has been fast enough. We want evolution not revolution. BOLT OPENS Good morning, girls. How are you today? This is what I call heritage farming. It's a... Not many people do it now. These cows are tied up with chains, in a byre. This is how they all used to be a hundred years ago. But not today. Nobody is willing to do the work. To clean them out, every day. When I'm gone, I don't think anybody will be willing to do this. Aye, of course, I wanted my son to take over the farm. It was just obvious that he would get the farm. It should be very satisfactory. In fact I just have my own little niche, with my cows. He does everything else. He decides exactly what the farm does. If he would be nicer to me, it would be even better. You see the hen-pens? I think they're all hiding. It's very blowy out there. You didn't come, we didn't see the chooks this morning, did we? No, we didn't see the chookies. Are you hungry? Are we going to get some lunch? "The 2nd of October, 1966. A fine but cold morning when we set off for Arrasaig. Alastair broached the subject of the future, as we drove back. Reckoned we should either go to Australia, or make Muck summer-only. I felt rather sick." When my brother wanted to leave, we considered selling the island. But I said no, because I couldn't bear to lose... everything of my first quarter-century of life. We were so embedded in the island, so to speak. I never envisioned living anywhere but on the island. You want pepper? You might need pepper. - Peppa Pig. - D'you want pepper, poppa? No, I don't think so, I don't do pepper. Well, I think we are unique, that the two of you came back. And I think it's wonderful because I think you help Colin, because you are two young families. We're so fortunate that he is such a clever chap, and can turn his hand to anything, absolutely anything. I mean, he might decide that... It's all too much responsibility. Well, that's right, he has a huge amount of responsibility. And if he decides that, we've got to be there to support him. That's what families do. If you love each other, you've got to be there to support each other's decisions Mhmm. What'd happen to the island if there was no MacEwens? You can't keep hold of something, just because it's been in our family for generations. If it's not working, then you've got to make changes. That's right, towards me. Straighten up! Straighten up, Dad. Straight. It's a fuel problem, is why you're not starting. Yes, the battery isn't much charging. - Yeah. - The battery on this? Yeah, well it did but... Ruth tried to start it. Well, I can do that for you. Okay? Thank you very much anyway. Dad? There's Rum from Eigg. He seems to be on Facebook. All the time, I know. Hello? Can you get your cows in, please? We want to get some sheep down the road. Come on, quick, quick. We want to move sheep past them. Yes, I'm sure you can. I will! Right, I'll just open the byre doors! No, you will not open the byre doors! Lawrence, come on! Why don't you just say you could go and do it? Jenny, I don't move that fast. Right. He feels that you don't finish the job. If you'd only just get on and finish the job, and then you can tick it off. But you do half the job and then leave it. Obviously, Lawrence, you're not agreeing with what I'm saying, so it's pointless having this conversation. I hate confrontation. Ehm... and it's such a shame because we live in such a wonderful place, and to have this constant arguing doesn't, ehm... is really quite hard. I don't think on the whole we are constantly arguing, because I... We don't talk to each other very much. "30th January, 1967. Daddy died. The following day, Sergeant Banks, Police Constable, arrived for a post-postmortem. Alastair and Lawrence to Eigg, to collect the coffin. Digging a grave at Lamb Island." I always had the highest admiration for my father. I was always interested in what he was interested. And it was a great shock to me when he died. Come on, chooks. Shall we give them some? Come on, chooks. That'll just have to put you on, till you get your proper feed. Go on, good chooks. Come on, chooks. Come on. Let's feed you. My father was always what you might call aloof from the day-to-day grind. Mother was running the farm in the war and father was in the Royal Navy. The island would operate without him. Come on, chooks. Come on, chooks. Good chooks. You call the chooks. Can you call the chooks? You tell them to come. You tell them to come. Come on! They say that farmers marry two people: they marry a farm and they marry a wife. And I'm quite sure that is correct. My older brother Alastair, he was worried that he wouldn't find a wife if he stayed here. So I was lucky that Jenny came to join me on the island. Life would have been very difficult on the island without Jenny. Cows! Cows! It's very important that you marry somebody who is accustomed to the conditions which you're going to live in. I already knew Jenny. I was attracted to her from the day I first saw her. Cows! Cows! But when I rowed Jenny across the bay, I recited this epic poem: "Lord Ullin's Daughter" "And who be ye would cross Lochgyle, This dark and stormy water? Oh, I'm chief of Ulva's Isle, And this, Lord Ullin's daughter. And fast before his father's men, Three days we've fled together, And should they find us in the glen, My blood would stain the heather. Outspoke the hardy Highland wight, I'll go, my chief, I'm ready. It is not for your silver bright, But for your winsome lady. And by my word! The bonny bird, In danger shall not tarry, And though the waves are raging white, I'll row thee o'er the ferry." Jenny was quite impressed. If you're ordering pig food, I'm doing it, because... - Hello, Harbera? - Oh! - Yes. - You are the most exasperating man! It's Lawrence here, from Muck. Not too bad, a bit chilly. Yes, well not as bad as last week. I need eight bags of sow rolls. But my wife wants to order something I think, so... She's always feeding wild birds, so... So I'll pass you the phone. Hi. I'm fine, I'm fine. If you make that ten, because we don't want to start ordering over Christmas, for the sow... For the sow rolls. And two of mixed grain. And two of mash. Poultry mash. And one, ehm... wild bird seed. One peanut. And one fat balls. Okay, thanks very much. Okay. Stay warm. Right. Bye, bye. Lawrence, I do the ordering! Why do you always do the ordering? You've got plenty to order. You've got all the Christmas presents. Aside from wedding preparations, Megan will be seeking British citizenship, as she made clear in yesterday's interview. She wants to get to know Britain better. Well, you have to take the test, dearie. Now being... boots on the ground in the UK I'm excited to get to know... Yes, get to know the weather! Come on, girls, come on. Come on, girls. I don't want to be run down. Hello, Polly. "11th of January, 2005. Wind southerly 6, becoming southwest, storm force 10 to hurricane force 12. Big storm at night. Road eroded, pier-house flooded. New waiting room inundated. In Gallanach one ring feeder has gone oval. Damage to the seawall. Cows in the garden, all vegetables gone. Windows and doors damaged. Huge boulders in the slipway. The school castle in pieces. Many trees down or dug up. Seas went over the new waiting room. Half of slates from the window inside of it, gone." It's very difficult when people arrive to know whether they are going to make a success or not. Only time tells whether they're suitable to become islanders. When you work on the sea you've got to have a great respect for it. You're never gonna beat it. It's a far stronger element than you are. So if it's dangerous and you're not sure you can haul the creels, well you don't do it. You can replace the creels, but you can't replace yourself. And so far, touch wood, I'm still here. "Thursday 18th of September, 2003. Wind was southwest 2 to 4. Brian back to meet the steamer and then went fishing. At 8 PM Donny MacKinnon found Clachan Boy attached to a fleet of creels, going in circles and in gear. No sign of Brian. All emergency services were called. Everyone who was there searched all night. Nothing was found." "The boat has left a stormy land, A stormy sea before her, When, Oh! Too strong for human hand, The tempest gather'd o'er her. And on they row'd amid the roar, Of waters fast prevailing, Lord Ullin reach'd the fatal shore, His wrath was changed to wailing. Come back! Come back! He cried in grief, Across the stormy water, And I'll forgive your Highland chief, My daughter! Oh, my daughter!" Brian's death was in a number of tragedies that occurred on the island, and they all were associated with the sea. It had quite an effect on us, but we had to overcome it and carry on. He's being very cautious. We haven't had a boat for a long time. And we're not gonna get another one for a long time. I'm not useless, even though my son thinks I am. It's far more sensible, we don't need all that space for pigs. Just put the pigs in half. Put the pigs... Let's not talk about the pigs. I mean, he can't even bring the fucking trailer down. Take this bag of... So number 153. "Go Tell It on the Mountain." And we do have a mountain here on Muck, but only one, and it's not very, very big. ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ That Jesus is his name ♪ He possessed no riches ♪ No home to lay his head ♪ He saw the needs of others ♪ And cared for them instead ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ Over the hills and everywhere... ♪ "7th June, 2015. Weather, wind westerly 4, but it was dry with some cloud. A very beautiful day. The Open Day. 110 patrons came on the Shearwater and 30 in other boats. Several people were seasick in the journey but everyone squashed onto the trailer. Lawrence took them round the farm. Sea eagles were under discussion." The only point in having Open Day is the benefit to the island. I mean there was a time... I don't know if it's that much of a benefit, especially when people bring their own sandwiches. They might have a cup of tea or they might buy the odd thing, but not really, because... on a whole, an average Shearwater day brings in just as many people. If the weather's good. Well, that's right, so why should the... why should the Open Day cause stress? That's what I'm saying, because in July we get... Well, because Colin feels that... I don't think Colin needs to be... Well it's his farm! Can't you see? You're showing people round his farm now. And he's made the improvements. It's not for you to say: well this tup or that tup, or the next tup is good or bad, or these cows are going to this different bull and... Because it's now up to Colin, and if Colin wants to have the Open Day, he's the one that should be doing the commentary. You should be the elder statesman, sitting back and meeting and greeting, and let Colin get on with the chat. Well, he obviously doesn't want to do chat. That's why and I think, this is my argument, maybe we should not have Open Day. Sweetie. We love it under our chins. No, haven't got it. When you've lived with someone as long as we've lived with each other, you have that affection and love, ehm... but you do see the other person's faults as well. He thinks he's always right, but I suppose... It's... Oh, I don't know, I don't want to be disloyal because... You know, I don't think he means to do it. It's difficult because Lawrence wants to be the top one. And Colin's slightly like that, too. They both want to be top. But one has to give in, and Lawrence being the older one... We just all have to come to terms with getting old. And some of us do it better than others. But it's to find an interest. I think the... The crux of the matter is to find an interest that... you can cope with in your older age, like gardening and things. Ehm... That you get enjoyment out of. - Hello, Lawrence. - Hello. We've got masses of pancakes. Have we? I noticed Ruth had made pancakes for her children. I was going to tell you. - No, Colin made the pancakes. I went in there with the bread and Colin made pancakes this morning. Oh, the other way, Papa. - Other way? - Yeah. What? This is the wrong way up... Oh, that's the way. Ah yes! You're quite right. What a clever boy you are. Ehm, that man's going... That's it, now that man fits. It's a cuckoo clock. Is it a cuckoo clock? - I don't think it is. - It isn't. Oops! I'm not sure what it is, lovey. I was thinking that actually I'd prefer to do more things on the farm. Well, I think you've got to really be realistic. It's jolly difficult when you're getting old, actually, coming to terms with the things you can do and you can't do. It'd be nice perhaps if I was able to give more advice. After all, older people sometimes... Well, Lawrence, the thing is that... That's going to be a problem, because the advice you can give is the advice you knew when you were farming, and farming has moved on so much now that our advice is old-fashioned, and this is something we've just got to come to terms with. Getting older is difficult. I'm sure it is for everyone. But I still think that I make a contribution to the island. After all, when you've spent 50 years in a place you ought to know something. My father was always called the Laird. In those days, there was quite a separation between him and the people who lived on the island. He's buried at Lamb Island, in a Viking burial circle. But I've always worked together with the people on the island, and I would like to join them here when I'm gone, in the same graveyard. And, as you'll notice, this graveyard isn't fenced. So I'm very happy if... the cattle walk over my grave. "They walked down the road together The night was covered in stars They reached the gate in silence He lifted for her the bars She neither smiled nor kissed him Because she knew not how For he was only a farmer's lad And she was a fine Ling cow" When I was a little boy, several things we did, was learning poetry. Watching the tide was another occupation. There was many places on the island we used to camp, but this rock was one of our favorites. We used to crawl in under this dark boulder, and lay out our bedding in this cave. And once we spent four nights here, though usually it was only for one. We'd light a fire outside and cook for ourselves. But, ehm, we were certainly very keen on camping. Wide to me, wide to me! Sit down. Sit down, Shona. Sit down, sit down. Sit down. We were very isolated. Alastair and I, we didn't have other children to play with. But we had a wonderful time, we loved the life. It was only that the time came at 12, we had to join another life. That was the hard part. No lass, stop it. When I went to boarding school it was such a complete contrast to my life here. I didn't fit in, the way the other boys did. Alastair was highly knowledgeable about history. So I learned a lot about Napoleon, and all these historical characters from Alastair. He used to tell me stories in bed, because we used to sleep beside each other, in opposite beds. Alastair was a steadying influence, and being the oldest, he'd a lot of power over us three younger children. I was much more liable to do foolish things. He was always very adult in his early life. He was always gloomy. He was always very gloomy about what was going to happen in the future. "Sunday 6th of May, 1990. Wind westerly force 4, showers, cold. Alastair decided to leave this world. His problems must have become too much for him. A terrible blow, it is hard to believe. Lawrence continued cleaning the byre, and in the afternoon went to East Hill, to throw sheep out and mend the fence." Why he took his own life, it's a total mystery, always has been. He had three children, lovely children, and yet he did that. If Alastair had stayed on the farm, he would certainly have had much more of a chance. "Friday 5th of April, 2019. Wind easterly, force 2, bright sunny day and warmer. Morning, a beach clean at Fang Mor. Colin painting the boat's floorboards. What a difference it's made." Monday's today, and it's a lot calmer but it's wet on the whole. And today me and Hugh cycled to school. It's cold, very cold. Then Mum and Dad were doing the sheep and the cattle. And then the hens. And... - Then... - We were really bored. I remember that. "Westerly force 4, increasing gale force 8." That's 8. That's meant to be an 8. And there's westerly force 4. That's the... It gives an idea how strong the winds are. "Hugh and Tara..." This is Saturday. "Hugh and Tara fed the hens and were blown over in the storm. Pancakes at Granny's and routine feeding." The diary now, because I don't run the island, it's much shorter. I tend not to have the knowledge. I used to have half a page for every day. Now, just pretty empty. I can still record the weather every day. I can lead an independent life. As long as I have my cows, I can lead an independent life. Come on. Look, she wants to lick her calf. She wants to wash it. These calves will leave the island and then they'll go to other farms. Later on they'll be slaughtered for beef. Come on, baby, you might as well go to bed. Go back to bed. I find it very difficult to send them away. But we all must die. We mustn't get too sentimental about animals. We all die, animals all die. Many feel a good life and a quick death is what we would aspire to. That is what most farmers give their animals. A good life and a quick death. Gosh, that's lucky. - Mummy, look! - That's nearly ready isn't it. Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Tomorrow that strawberry is bound to be ripe. "November 1st, 2018. Wind south-westerly 2, some showers, a pleasant day. Ruth just made it to St John's Hospital in Livingston, and at 1 PM with a weight of 10 pounds, Magnus Alastair MacEwen arrived in this world." Hello, hello, hello.
