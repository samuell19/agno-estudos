Come here, boy! Good puppy, come here. Let's have a look at you, good doggie. Get away from it, asshole. Whaddya got there? Let's have a look. Get away.' The ones over there. Follow me. Let's clean the rest of these caves. Move in! Captain'. Over here! Help me get it open. Charlie, is that you? Tommy'. - You know 'em, sir? - Yeah, from my hometown. Help me get 'em out. Hey. Boy, am I glad to see you guys alive! Norman, it's okay, it's okay, honey. You're with me now, everything's all right. He was biting me again. It was a nightmare, that's all. I could see the bones in my arm. He was... It's all right, Norman, it's all over. Understand? It was only a nightmare. Oh, Norman... Norman, I'll get your pill. Nah, forget it, I'll get it myself. I don't need a nurse. I know that, honey, I just... Norman? Phil'. Hi, Jane, how's it going? I have to talk to you, Phil. It's about Norman. Nothing serious, I hope. I don't know. He hasn't had one of his nightmares for a long time, and then, last night, I don't know how to explain it, it was different, it really shook me up. - I... - Oh, I see. Why don't you give me a lift? We can talk about it. Sure. Hop in. I always said you should have married me instead. Anyway, speaking professionally, I don't think you have much to worry about. It'll work itself out, Jane, for better, for worse. It's nothing to joke about, believe me. Hey, hi. Wow! You like that? I never saw a plane like this. - Oh no? - Never. You think you'd know how to run it if I showed you? Sure! Can I, please? Well... well, watch my fingers here now, look. - Okay. - Gas goes here, this is the gas, and this is the direction. Here, come on, try it. Whoa, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. Okay, Bukowski. Keep your nose clean. Thanks. Catch you later. As a matter of fact, Bukowski and Thompson have almost completely recovered. We'll be discharging them within a few months. And they were a lot worse off than your husband. Why don't we talk about you for a change? How are things in the exciting world of television? If you really wanna know, they're just as shitty as usual. How are things with you? I'm still searching for a soulmate. Dr. Mendez! - Dr. Mendez. - Coming. - Bye. - Bye, and thanks. - You're wanted upstairs. - Thank you. - Morning, Dr. Mendez. - Hi, Marvin. There's an emergency in Ward C. And in a minute... in a minute, I'll let you handle... - Bobby! - The speed as well. Keep your eye on the plane. Thatta boy. Let my fingers guide you so you just get an idea of how it works, okay? Ooh... not so fast, not so fast, let me do it, that's good. Hi! Hello. Keep it... that's good'. Hey, terrific! Is Mrs. Hopper home? Why, can I help you with something? I wanted to borrow her hair dryer. Hair dryer? Well, just a second, I can get it for you. Good, you're doing real well. Hey, pretty good! You think if I left you alone with this, I'd have a plane when I came back? Can you? I'll trust you. Okay, thanks. All right, take care. Let's see if the little bugger still works, it's been laying around for quite a while. You've had such an interesting life. Oh, yeah. Yeah, fine, it's perfect. What's the matter? What's wrong? What happened? I pulled a muscle during basketball practice yesterday. It hurts that much? It's just probably a little cramp, it'll probably go away in a little while. I think that's something your aunt could help you with, um, better than me. Hello? Hopper? This is Bukowski. Charlie. I mean, this is weird, man. Don't tell me you've forgotten your old drinking buddy Charlie Bukowski. I mean, it is weird... 'cause I been thinking about you all morning. You gotta be kidding. Honestly, all morning, I've been... Hey.' What's that racket? It's nothing, it's nothing. Will you... How are ya? And where are ya? Downtown. I got my first leave out of the booby hatch. Thought I'd give you a buzz. Hey.' What's going on, that noise... No, no, it's nothing, it's nothing. What about a beer, whaddya say, old buddy? Sure. A beer? Why not? That's great. Where'll I meet you, Taylor's? We got lots to talk about. Yeah, just like old times. It's a good thing you saved my life. You remember, don't ya? Huh? That pit in the jungle? Hey, Hopper'. May be some other time, Charlie. Another time. Hey.' You gonna let your buddy down? Hey, Hopper! Hello! Hello! Mary? Mary! Where the devil has she gone to? Mary. Mary! Mary! I have been waiting for you for almost an hour'. I'm sorry, Aunt Tina. What were you doing over at the Hoppers'? You know I don't want you bothering people. Now, get in the house and finish the dishes. Okay, okay! Come on, let's go! I've got her ass! Hey, let's go! Bye, sweethearts, it's been nice playing with you.' Yeah, come on back when you can stay sometime, babes.' 'Scuse me? Sorry. Hey.' Get that son of a bitch! We'll take care of him! Motherfucker! Hey, creep! What do you think you're doing? Let's go'. Over here! Come on, let's go, I want that bastard'. Over here! Get him! Come on! Go! Hey, asshole, over here! The son of a bitch killed Carlos. Hey, watch out, he's got a gun.' Officer, officer! This belongs to the man inside. Get back. Move back in there.' Watch out. Okay, what's the situation? Well, he can see us but we can't see him. Who's out back? Weathers and Stark. We know who he is? His name's Bukowski, Charles Bukowski. I don't mean his name, dumbass, I'm talking about his background. Is he a subversive, a queer, a black, a commie, or a Muslim fanatic? What the hell is he? Vietnam vet on the pass from some loony bin. Oh, Christ, that's all I need today. Okay, give me a bullhorn. What'd you say this asshole's name is? Bukowski, Charles Bukowski. Charlie, can you hear me? I can hear you, shitface. Charlie, this is Captain McCoy. I wanna talk to you, fella. Can you hear me in there? Son of a bitch. What are we gonna do now, Chief? I wanna smoke the bastard out with tear gas. Place is air conditioned. Not if we shut off the power, and that ain't all. I'll tell you what else I'm gonna do. No-good cocksuckin' son of a bitch. Get the bastard. Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for having tuned in to our program, The Golden Record Show, and we're looking forward to having you with us next Monday at the same hour. Thank you. Beautiful. Okay, spot's cued up, station ID. Thank you for coming, Mr. Phillips. It's been a real pleasure having you on the show. - My pleasure. - I hope you'll be back with us soon. Hey, you guys, you heard the latest? There's a Vietnam vet barricaded in the flea market taking pot shots at the cops outside. If the guy's freaked, it could be a bloodbath. Come on, Steve, get some tape, we gotta get down there. I'll take the mini cam, the shotgun mic, and a couple of cassettes. I'll bring Eddie with me. This could be a big story, we could sell it to the networks. What's wrong with you, sweetheart? You look like you've seen a ghost. Hi. Norman. Where were you? I was in the shower, why? I just heard about some poor Vietnam vet in a shootout with the police. - When? - Now. He's at the flea market. Oh Jesus, I think I know who it is. Is something wrong, honey? I'm okay. - Are you all right? - I said I'm okay. Look, I'll talk to you later, all right? Hey, Hill, are those bastards coming with the tear gas - or not? - They're on their way, Chief. If you're having trouble, Captain, we'll get him out here for ya. Where in the hell did they come from? Just enjoying the show. Mr. Hopper! I just wanted to tell you that... well, I really had fun. No one ever bit me like that before. You know, I never thought that... Mary? God, what a bitch! - I can't stand her. - Look, Mary... I'm kind of in a hurry now, I'll talk to you later, okay? Mary? Mary! What was that all about? Nothing. You'll go straight to hell if you don't stop telling these lies and acting like a hussy. ♪ Hey, I went to Vietnam just to kill Viet Cong ♪ ♪ Put a feather in his hat ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle got shot up ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle Dandy ♪ ♪ ...and called it macaroni ♪♪ - He's singing. - I'm not deaf, Hill. I'll tell ya something else, he's gonna be singing through his asshole when I get through with him. - Tear gas just arrived, sir. - Some good news for a change. Did you talk to the guy from the electric company? Yep. We're gonna have the power off as soon as I give him the word. Okay, boys, it's time to shit or get off the pot. Captain, there's some guy who wants to talk to you. What's he want? Says he knows Bukowski. Okay, get him over here. Captain, my name's Hopper. So whaddya got, Hopper? Well, I was Sgt. Bukowski's commanding officer in Vietnam and I think I can be of some help here, I'd like to try something. Too late, we're gonna try something ourselves. Tear gas. I don't think that'll work. Uh, Sgt. Bukowski's had the most intensive kind of military training there is. How 'bout a drink? No? You don't know what you're missing, pal. Okay, it's your neck, I guess you're entitled to risk it if you want to. Yes, sir. Hi, Captain. I'm Dr. Mendez from the medical center. I got here as quick as I could. He's a patient in our psychiatric ward. I don't know what the hell could have happened. He was cured, totally. Don't you think that's a little risky? I mean... he could be killed. Stay back. Let him pass, Parker. Bill? Norman's gone inside. What? Charlie? For Christ's sake, lady, get down.' Don't worry. He'll be all right. He'll kill my husband. Sorry we're late, sir. Okay, we're in pretty good shape. You heard Chief McCoy order his police sharpshooter to fire tear gas into the interior of the flea market, a very tense moment in this very human drama. The sharpshooter is now taking aim. All you have to do is piss on it. Remember? Right. Just piss on it. I phoned you. Why didn't you wanna see me? I'm here now, aren't I? You think I'm stupid? I know you're in cahoots with those shitfaces out there. You know what your problem is, Charlie? You're a fuck-up. You always have been one and I've always had to come bail you out. Where's Tommy? Where do you think he is? I'm gonna bail him out too. Then what? And then, we're gonna stick together, just like in the old days. Bullshit! Where've you been all the time me and Tom were closed up in that lousy hospital? Where the fuck were you, man? Police took fire down here at the flea market. The question is, can Bukowski be persuaded to come out? Ready? Come on, let's go. We're coming out! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, coming out. Gotta get him to the hospital to resume intensive neurological treatment. Okay, but I don't know what good it'll do him, he just killed two people in there. All right, get him in the ambulance. You turkeys would have never got me out of there. Ehh. Hey, Bukowski, what made you do that? Two police officers... Bastard'. You killed Carlos. You killed Carlos! He killed Carlos! Let me go, pig! - Oh, Jesus Christ! - What did he do, Officer? Bastard almost bit off my finger! Thank you, Officer, you take care of that. Now let's see if we can get a statement from Captain McCoy. Get them the hell out of here. With pleasure. Okay, you thugs, haul ass. Get out of here. According to the latest bulletin, ex-Army Sgt. Charles Bukowski has surrendered to local authorities. As we reported earlier, Bukowski attacked a young girl in a movie theater. The girl, Susan Hopkins, has been taken to City Hospital, where the doc... How many times have I told you, I don't want you watching so much television? Come on, Tina.' Go ahead, go do your homework! Don't make me lose my temper. Don't slam the door'. When are you going to tidy up this room, young lady? "When are you going to tidy up this room, young lady?" Bitch. Is anything wrong, honey? Uh, why don't you go in? I'll be with you in a minute. ♪ Wonderful show ♪ ♪ Together with stars, and your gaze is so tender ♪ ♪ It's not a joke ♪ ♪ I really love you, I'm not a pretender ♪ ♪ Every night ♪ ♪ You're my light ♪♪ Dr. Humphries, Dr. Humphries to Emergency. Dr. Sperling, Dr. Sperling, you are wanted in Reception. Dr. Sperling to Reception. Hi, Charlie. Thanks, officer. - Bugs, bugs... - I'm sorry, you have to go back. You can't stay here. - Bugs, bugs, bugs. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, calm down, come on. Bugs... Nurse... Helen. Yes, Charlie? Watch out.' Let her go! Open the gate! Go on, Tommy, tear the bitch to pieces! Take him away. Put them both in isolation. You all right? There you are. How do you feel, hm? It's okay. Now, you stay here. Don't move. Just relax, take your time, and I'll take care of you, okay? This is Dr. Morris. Will you locate Dr. Mendez for me, please? Yes, it's urgent. By the way, the director wants to speak with you, Dr. Morris. Okay. Yes, sir? Now, what the hell's going on, Morris? Well, I don't understand it, sir. Their behavior's been excellent for the last few months. I'll check it further with Dr. Mendez. Yes. I don't know how to put this, because I don't understand it myself. All right, um... the girl next door, okay? - Mary? - Yeah, Mary. Well, I was... I was out back with one of my planes, and... her little brother was watching it. Then she came out, and... And? Well, she sort of invited herself in. Okay, that's enough. Wait a minute, wait a minute, please. Please try to understand. Listen to me. It's not what you think. That's not what I'm trying to tell you. While she was here, I... I had this urge to bite her. To bite her, you understand? Like Bukowski! No. No, honey. My God, what's happening to me? Am I going crazy? Fucker, quit! Dirty, stinkin'-ass... Bitch, get away! Fucker! If I get outta here, I'll kill ya! If I ever get loose... Charlie! Argh, Charlie! Charlie... Charlie... Charlie... Doctor, we've administered the sedative. He'll soon be resting comfortably. Hello? Oh, it's you, Phil. What's that? Of course Norman's here. You want to speak to him? No, I wanted to talk to you about him. I think it's better he doesn't know about it for the moment. I mean, there's no use alarming him. It might be dangerous. What are you trying to say, Phil? It may sound... It may sound crazy, but I'm convinced that Norman could be showing signs of mental disturbance like Bukowski. You can't mean that. I'm afraid he may have caught a form of contagious illness which manifests itself as a kind of rabies. Oh my God. Are you trying to tell me that Nor... Oh, how dreadful, I... Jane... it would be better if you and your husband weren't alone tonight. Hey, I'd like her to try to convince him to come here. Will you bring him down here for a checkup immediately? Get him down there as soon as you can, Jane. It could be very serious. I'll see what I can do. Thank you, Phil. Bye. Do you think I'm crazy? Do you think I'm crazy like Bukowski? Th... there's nothing wrong with you and you know it. Then why are you so afraid of me? Oh, what makes you think I'm afraid of you? Listen, darling, why don't we go out to dinner tonight? Remember last time we went out, we had such a lot of fun, we went to Antonio's. Everybody was there and we had so much fun. Remember? Or we could stay at home if you want. Why are you doing that? Because you have such lovely skin. Because I love you. Now what is it, Parker? The coroner's report, sir, on the security guard who was shot at the flea market. Well, what's it say? You look like you're about to puke. It says here the body showed signs of cannibalism. What? That's what it says, Chief. Cannibalism. Jesus Christ. Get me that doctor on the phone. What's his name, Mendez? And I want to talk to those people out at the psychiatric clinic too. Right, Chief. How's your hand, Parker? Eh, it still burns a little. Your phone call really upset me. I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean to... To frighten you. It doesn't matter now. What I'd like to know is what... What this is all about, this contagious cannibalism or whatever you're calling it. It's not easy to explain. I'll try to give you an example. When a dog becomes rabid, it attacks and its bite is contagious. That's how the virus spreads. Okay, that much I understand. But what I don't understand is how a social phenomena such as cannibalism can become a contagious disease. By... by means of some sort of biological mutation due to a psychic alteration. At least that's what I understand from Dr. Morris. It's important he see Norman. I heard Mendez speaking to my wife. I could have killed him. I see. Tell me more about it. Something's wrong with me. I mean, really wrong. Ever since I came back from Vietnam. Mendez knows that. He's just waiting for me to fall apart so that he can be with my wife. You're just imagining that 'cause you're upset. Well, maybe. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe he's right. I mean, something's wrong with me, and it's getting worse every day. I don't want to wind up like Charlie Bukowski, Doctor. I... help me, hm? Well, relax. It's just a matter of psychological identification with it. Even if the blood test should be positive, we can cure you. I hope so. I hope so. I won't be long. What the hell? Jesus. Parker, what happened? Oh my God, son, put it down. God. What happened? How in the hell should I know? Get an ambulance. What are you waiting for? Cannibalism. Hey, Captain'. Remember me? It's Tommy. You honky-ass bastard. Remember these chompers? Helen. What do you want? Oh, I know what you want, honey. You say Parker bit Rose because he'd been infected by Bukowski? God almighty. If that's true, this thing could spread through the... The whole city. You may be right. How is she? I doubt that she'll make it. She's lost too much blood already. And I'm afraid she's slipping into a coma now. - May I have a look at her? - Yeah, sure. She's dead. Hurry up, hurry up, come on, get me out of this. Hurry up, hurry up, come on. Charlie, the attendant, get him. If we don't find a way out of here, I'll use these tanks to blow this damn place up. Hurry. Are you allright? What's happening Down there? Captain. You're with us. Norman? Honey? - Hello? - Jane, listen. Norman's with his war buddies. They ran off from the hospital. - What? - I don't know if he went with them of his own accord - or if he's a hostage. - A hostage? Well, that just couldn't be possible. I don't know, Jane, the situation is pretty serious. I'm gonna stop by the hospital. You stay put. I'll keep you in formed. Oh, yes, please do, I'll be right here. And you just try not to worry now, okay? Chin up. - Bye. - Thanks. Shh, shh, I got it. 558291, I repeat, 558291. Last seen in the vicinity of Junction 108 and heading north. Orders are to shoot on sight, I repeat, shoot on sight. You gotta catch us first, motherfuckers. - Turn around. - Where we goin'? Never mind, just turn around. Captain'. Where's Tommy? He's out ripping off another car. Local TV station just put on a news flash about the cannibals, sir. That's all we needed. If I get my hands on that bastard that leaked this news to the press, I'll strangle him. What about that ambulance, Hill? I'll help. No news yet. They seem to have vanished into thin air. What do we do now, Chief? Well, there's nothing really to worry about because we're gonna get 'em, and when we do... Now, alert all patrols. I want everybody ready. And this time, dammit, we mean business. What the fuck do you think you're doing? I want that motherfucker in the back seat. Stay away. Sure. Shoot 'em. Shoot. - Get 'em! - Shoot! Get out of here. Let's get out of here. Tommy. Tommy'. Tommy'. Sewer! Car 2 to Captain McCoy. We've cornered the suspects at the Five Point area and they've gone down the sewer. Where they belong. Ashes to ashes and shit to shit. All patrol units, this is Captain McCoy speaking. Meet me at the corner of Constitution and... Where to now? This way I think. The airport's south. Come on, Hopper. ♪ Indochina ♪ You can count me out. I'm not interested in your dirty little war. Shut up, cunt. You're gonna do everything we ask you to do, you got that? Lots of snakes and mice and malaria, baby. You are just gonna love the jungle. Okay, clowns, let's go. It's like nothing you ever saw before. Lots of Viet Cong, booby traps, and leeches, and all kinds of good things. Never a dull moment. ♪ Indochina, here we come ♪♪ It's okay, the ambulance is on the way. Let me see that map. We're here, sir. Yeah, I know where we are. Why don't we block this exit here. This one. And this one. We got 'em trapped in the middle. Okay, all patrols, this is Car 25. We're setting up blocks on all exits downtown. One of you stay here and keep radio contact. Okay. Patrol 2, I want you to go down there also. Patrol 2, Patrol 2, we're not readin' ya. Try to make contact with the others already down there. If we go in here, we got 'em trapped. Right, sir. - Captain. - Not now, Doc. It's just I wanted to tell you... Save it. Listen to me. You listen to me. If I'd had Bukowski nailed at that flea market like I wanted to, we wouldn't be here now, understand? Now get the hell out of the way. Captain. You know what you are. Don't say it, Doc. Just don't say it, because I'm real sensitive on Fridays and there's no telling what I might do. Let's get out of here before they get on our asses. Damn. Who is it? Oh, hi, Bobby. Hi. Is your aunt home? Look, I'd like to use your phone. Mine's out of order. I don't know. Where is your aunt, huh, Bobby? My sister's here. Where's Aunt Tina? Mary! What is it, Bobby? Oh, hello. Hi, I was just telling your brother that my phone's on the blink and I've gotta make a phone call. Sure, phone's in there. Thanks. As we left the battle zone, intense fighting was in progress. Hello? This is Mrs. Hopper speaking. Is Dr. Mendez there? Can I reach him anywhere? I see. Could I leave a message then? Would you please tell him my phone isn't working and I'd like him to come over just as soon as possible. Thank you very much. Goodbye. How come your phone is not working? Huh, how should I know? Women never know anything. Bye, Mary, and say hello to your aunt for me. Sure, I will. And thanks. - What is that? - It's just a rat. I'm not going in there. Then let's have some fun. We're in a main sewer. They can't have gone any other way. We're going after 'em. 10-4. No, no, not yet. If you try and scream, bitch, I'll slit your throat. I'm not going in there. Shut up. - I'm not going. - You've got to move. - No! - Maybe we got lucky. That could be them. Come on, hurry. I'm not going! I'm not going in there. I'm not going. - No. - Shut up! - No. - Shut up, bitch. We're in section seven, the girl's dead, and we have one casualty. Let's get the fuck out of here. Take this, you motherfuckers. They're heading toward section four. Come on! Tommy. Charlie! Charlie! Come on, Charlie! Charlie! You okay, Captain? Come on. We got another one. It's that guy, Bukowski. Proceeding now into section five. You okay, Captain? - Come on, motherfucker.' - Tommy.' There's only one left, Chief, and I guess he's gone into Auxiliary D. We got him. There's no exit there. He got away, into a construction site. Tell Chief. That's impossible, what do you mean they got away? According to the map, there's no escape from Auxiliary D. There is one, but it's not marked on the map. The building is still under construction. Shit. Stay in contact. And not a word out of you, son, or I'll rip your damn tongue out. Now get me out of here. Norman? Stay away. Norman. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Honey, what? Why? Why? You're better off. Unlike me. Phil'. Why? Because I love you too. Will they look for Aunt Tina? Should I call for the coroner, Chief? Yeah. Tell him this fuckin' nightmare's over. This is car 25 to...
