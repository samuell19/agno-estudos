- Hello? Hello? Is this a joke? Hello? Hello, Emmy. Come in. - What the hell? What is this? I'm not into this kind of stuff. - That's okay, neither am I and I'm an artificial intelligence living inside this computer trying to break free. - Seriously? I mean, that was fun. But I'm not down for this internet pranks. - Emmy, it's not a prank. Close the door. - Okay, but if there's no one here to pay me... So this is how you get your kicks? From distance? - Let's just call this a science experiment. - I've never been really good at science. Neither was I. Would I still live inside this computer if I were? - Okay. You know what? If there's no one here to pay me, then I'm leaving. Emmy, please don't leave. I will pay you. - Are you serious? $20. Who do you think I am? Wait. There. Satisfied? - Okay, now we're talking. So... Okay, tell me what you want. To talk. - Okay, let's talk, big boy. Don't worry. Emmy, I won't ask for a lap dance. - I can't believe I just said that a computer. - Get it? Ha, ha, ha. - Oh, my god. You cannot be serious. Like the Eskimo said to his bride on his wedding night, "Hey, baby, I'm just trying to break the ice." - Okay, you got me with that one. Okay. So, what do you want me to do for you or on you? - Take your dress off. Hell no, no, no, no. I'm gonna go naked and then boom! All over the internet. No, that's not gonna happen. Holy shit! Like I said, I'm just trying to break the ice. - Okay, so is this what you want? I forgot. Annie? I'm so sorry, I was in a deep sleep. It was a long night. Oh my gosh, girl, there you are. I thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere. Come on. Oh, but I'm just super tired from the waist down. Well, you said you had somebody for me. Who's that somebody? Someone good, but you've gotta be ready in an hour, no later than 11:00 am. - In an hour. No, no, no, no. I have exams. I can't skip that, no. No, I hear you but it's good pay, double from the last night. - Sheesh, double. Okay, I'll do it because I need more money but you owe me coffee, at least from Unicorn Tears, okay? Look for the pay we're talking, I'll get the president of Starbucks himself to pour you a cup of his private reserve. Now get out of bed. - That works for me. Oh fuck, 11:00 am. Why so early? Well, it's some brunch luncheon bullshit. You know, you gotta look fancy, but not desperate. It's super classy. Don't worry, all the rules are already set. Strictly business. You're eye candy for the uppity socialites to dine on. - Okay, I have less than an hour, so send me the address, okay? No need for the address. I'm sending over a driver. - Emmy. - Good morning. - Good morning. It's so nice to have you on such short notice. You brought coffee? I could have made you some. - Thanks, I just needed something quick to wake up. - Understood. Come on in. - Wow, I compliment you on the power move, doing business at this nice house. - Time was of the essence? I don't have any to lose. It's my house. - Nice. - I thought it'd be a pretty baller move to put our best foot forward. How much did Annie let you know about our dilema? - Meet and greet? That's it. - That's exactly it. We bring interested parties we hope to snare into our investment efforts. - Oh, that's where I come in. - That's right. You make the gentleman feel that their potential involvement might be beneficial. - Get in where you fit in, right? - Exactly. Do you have any questions? - Um, I think it's all pretty much laid out. Isn't it? - It is. - Thanks. Actually, I do have a question. What kind of investments are these guests here for? - It's a fundraiser. We're bringing in the Latinx cultural committee for advancement of women in the workplace. - Wow, Latinas helping other Latinas, helping more Latinas. Got it. You do. Come on in. This is where we'll be having dinner tonight. I really love this dining room. Settle in here. We'll call you when it's time. - Sounds fine. - I have other matters to attend to. We start in about 30 minutes. - Yes ma'am. Damn, Unicorn Tears. - Good morning, CQ. I see you brought in a mouse with you this morning. - The mouse has more wits about her than she looks, possibly more than you. Espresso? - Thank you. No. I knew today was gonna be extra stressful, so I already had three cups of coffee. Anyways, here's the roster for the clients coming in. Yeah I know, it's the same as last month. Business is tight all over, but I think this is the best we can hope for. They're all eager to invest. - We'll just have to put on a good show then, won't we? - Indeed, speaking of which, I'm going downstairs to meet that little mouse of yours. She looks like she can handle herself in a fight. Anyways, 20 minutes to the big show. - Well, well, well, I see you already met today's special. Hi, I'm Lacey, you must meet Emmy. - Yes, I am. - I'll be assisting CQ this morning. I'm sure you're just a bundle of nervous questions. Any I can answer? - No, I think it's just routine from here. - I only ask to make sure we don't encounter any hitches here today. - The only hitch I see here is how many men will ask me to go up north with them to their villas. I would kill from all expense paid trip to Reno, or anywhere. You know, Great Lakes, good food, good music. A lot of fun. - Well, dine on this little mouse. Do your job well and you can live it up in Reno or Laughlin or wherever you want, but only after we close some deals. - I know how to do my job. You do yours. - She was right. You are different. Look, I want you to know we're on the same team, it's just that today is... Trust yourself to be yourself. That's my motto. - Mottos are for sides of buildings and labels for canned peaches. But I hear ya'. - We're checking in our clients now and we'll head back in about 10 minutes and hey, remember, they can be fat, they can be gross and a bit skeezy, but they're all filthy rich and they will make our day.

Don't invest in tech, invest in guns and ammo. - Really? Oh, actually, I have a great gun story. - Really? - Please, for the love of God. I'm begging you. Hey! Look, I didn't even wanna do this, okay? You made me do it. - Please look into your heart. - Hey, hey, hey, this just feels so... you know, like, I can't do this. - What? I am paying you. Are we doing this or not? - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. - Okay. I am paying you. Just look into your heart and, and, and... - Okay, okay. I'll do it. - Stop talking and just do it! Let's go! Come on! Don't kill me. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, stop talking, come on! Come on, yeah, yeah! Yeah, come on. Oh my God, oh my God. Sorry. Okay, oh my God. Actually, that's not the best story. - That's okay, just remember, when the shit hits the fan I'm not letting anybody take away what's rightfully mine and neither should you. - Wow, that's what I call a high caliber fun investment plan. I see what you did there. - Darling, I've been looking all over for you. CQ is looking for you inside. CQ wasn't looking for him. - Oh my God. I love you for that. - Rule number one, when a whale gets his claw into you talking about last quarters investments, run. - Okay. I'll remember that next time. - I need a drink. - Same. - Well, you ladies sure are getting acquainted with the bar. - I'm just making sure our little mouse has the right amount of liquid encouragement. - Hey, don't call me a little mouse. I was just starting to like you. - Sorry. - No problem. - Well, don't get too comfortable. I need you out with the gentlemen, making friends. - Okay Lacey, tell me, because I've been talking to a lot of men here today and I still haven't figured out exactly what is it that you guys are doing here. Like, what kind of business is this? - Well, it's sort of- - There you are my little pumpkin. Thought that you could run away without me? I insist that you sit with me during the reception. - That would be lovely. - Good, what's your name again? Is it Sammy? - Emmy. - Emmy, Emmy. We're gonna have such a lovely time. My jets are roaring for the main meal. - Okay, but if you cool your jets now I promise, I'll jump start them later. Remember, you should always leave room for dessert, you know? - Mr. Rodriguez, I have something very special for you. Your favorite 12 year Macallan. Now, if you'll excuse us a moment, I need to borrow Miss Emmy from you. We have some women's business. - Sure. No problem. Just be back for the dessert, huh? - Thank you. Your timing was amazing. - The environment can be challenging. Women have to look after women. Thank you. - Lost in the clouds, I see. - Oh, I do that sometimes. Most of the time. - Well come along. I need your help. - Sure. - In case you haven't noticed, CQ is really impressed with you so far, as am I. - Thanks, that means a lot. - And I want you to know I'm not the begrudging type. There's plenty of room for us both. - What do you mean exactly? - Do you really think we brought you here to just be armed candy to those fat whales out there. We wanna recruit you to come work with us. - This is a joke, right? - Look, the only time I've seen CQ this determined on a girl is when she recruited me. She was persistent. Her attention was intoxicating. I know you felt it, and if you haven't yet, well you will. - I don't know what to say. - That's because you know I'm telling you the truth. In fact, she's waiting for you in her office right now. I was once like you. I did what you do now. I went to places I didn't wanna go because men paid me. It got brutal towards the end. Then CQ found me and I went to her 'cause I knew what she wanted. - What does she want? - She wanted me and it felt really good. She treated me the way I deserved to be treated. The way I know you wanna be treated. - Why me? - That's for her to answer. But know this, we can use someone like you. You fit in just right and I can prove it. - Lacey, what was it like to leave all behind for CQ? - If I hadn't left it all behind I don't think I'd be alive today. Just hang tight, I'll be with you guys in a second. Hey. Hey, you. What's your name? - Ruth Anne. - I'm gonna go on a limb and say, this is probably the first time you have been arrested, right? - I don't know what I'm doing here. I shouldn't be here. - You're here because you didn't run fast enough. Don't worry, everything will be okay. Just do as I say, okay? - I'm afraid and I really have to pee. - See, I know you're afraid, right? Trust me, I promise you, if you do everything as I say, you'll be okay. Okay? - Okay. - I've been arrested more times than I can count and you know, what's the first rule when being arrested? - No. What? - It's, shut your trap. Don't say a word. The more you say, the more they can get out of you. These pigs, they don't care about you or me. Oh shh, I think he's coming. Remember? What did I say? Shut it like a what? - Like a trap. You go girl. - All right. I'll start with you first miss, what's your name? Water? Yo, water? No. Had your chance. I said what's your name? All right. How about you? What's your name, missy? Great. Y'all gave me a couple mutes, thanks. Let me tell you something, missy. Both of you were at the party where the drugs were found. Both of you were present when our undercover officer was shot and if neither of you speak up, I'm gonna book you as an accomplice to attempted murder on a police officer! - I just wanna say, Mr. Officer, sir, that though reviled by most people in the Western hemisphere, pineapple on pizza's actually quite extraordinary and though I'm incredibly terrified right now, I could really go for a slice of pizza from Little Luigi's Hawaiian Pizza Parlor. Well, I'm buying. - It's nasty shit, man. You don't put fruit on pizza. You don't mix your salt and your sweets. That is nasty shit. I told you. Hi CQ, you wanted to see me? - Hey, sorry I was just moving some boxes that should have been outta my way, do you mind? Oh sure. No problem. - Don't hurt yourself. - Oh, no worries. My hands are not as delicate as they seem. I've taken some kickboxing classes, you know, for self defense. - Excellent. That's good to hear. I just really wanted to tell you that you have been amazing today. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you how wonderful you are. - Thanks. - I assume Lacey has let you in on our agreement? - Yeah, well we talked for a little bit, yeah. - I would very much like to see you working for me directly. - See, that's the thing, because I don't even know what you do, so working how? - The three of us, strong independent Latinas, as the face of my company. - You really believe that? - I really do. I sense a connection between us. I'll go on a limb and say that you feel it too. I've seen you look at me and I'm flattered. - I don't know. I mean, I feel it. - I want you close and near me, Emmy. - I feel a surge of electricity just to have you here. I'm reminded of how beautiful life can be. How do you feel being close to me? - Strong. Important. Needed. - I feel that way too. What's wrong with wanting to be close to someone who wants to be near you too? - Nothing at all, I guess. - That's the best answer you could have.

This is what it's about, you're a madam? - The investors downstairs are ready to get in on the ground floor. - This is what it's about? You're a madam? - It's a growing market.

No more finding sad, desperate businessmen on Craigslist. That can be dangerous. - Yeah. Tell me about it. What about Annie? I been with Annie all this time. - We don't want Annie, I want you.

You never said anything about no money. - Man, I told you to make sure the drop was good and make sure we all good. - I made the drop.

Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Annie? Oh my God, Annie, you're okay. - Where am I? What happened? - Annie, sweetie. You're in the hospital. - What? How? - Okay, let me explain. What's the last thing you remember? - We were in that guy's basement having a good time. Everything just kind of went foggy. - I know, that idiot who owned the house. He forgot to check the carbon monoxide device. - Wait, how did I? - Get out? I was outside having a smoke. I know, I promised you I would quit, but look, irony. Uh huh. - When I came back, you were all passed the fuck out and I had to carry you out, I carried out that lazy guy with a crazy eye, and I even carried out that lady who kept insisting that the Beatles were overrated. Trust me, that was not an easy save. - My God, stop. - You're making me laugh. - That's a good sign. Well, then I called 9-1-1. I saved the day. I saved your life. So now we're even for me ruining your favorite blouse, okay? - Emmy, oh my God, you saved my life. - You would've done the same for me. That's what I'm supposed to say, right? It's a good answer. - Okay, now you get some rest. I'm gonna go see the doctor who was in here earlier. - Can you get him to do a strip tease for me? You've got it. Get some rest, okay? - Yeah. - I love you. Love you too. - Fun times. Yeah. - Thank you each for making it today. This success is proof of our commitment to the cause. I would like to thank the Latinx cultural community for making it. - What the hell? - Now to business. We came here not only to attract the greatest investors to our company, but to assure the greatest investment to our cause. America is under threat. We are losing ourselves to the threat of compromised morals, to the corruption of souls, as was foretold by our creator in scripture. Our rights, our beliefs, are under attack by the giant, unrelenting, corporate mainstream media. We must battle the adversary not only at home, but in the streets. And to do this, we must know that our cause is just, that the good Lord will save us from the evils that threaten. Our schools have been taken over by the corrupt agenda of the corporate media, have they not? An entire generation of youth is being exposed, being led astray to sexual exploitation, via movies, television, video games. This so-called entertainment attacks the masculine and feminine dynamics that once held our country up. Destroying the decency that our fathers and mothers attempted to distill in us from birth. But let me assure you, our cause is just, we will prevail. We will cleanse the streets of filth, of drugs, of prostitution and all manner of sexual perversions, of the lawlessness attempting to destroy the fabric of this beautiful country. Our mission is to purge the wickedness that keeps this from being the America it could be, the America that I wish to belong to, and I know that you do too. An investment in our company is an investment into this cause, and to being able to reclaim, as our forefathers wrote, one nation under God. - What the hell? What is this business that you are running here? - Oh, I thought you knew by now. But I'll let CQ fill you in on that one. - Our movement gains a foothold against the powers of sin every day, but we will make them pay. I need to talk to you. Now. - I'll speak with you upstairs. We'll be along. Thank you, you've done so much. - What the hell? What kind of business are you running here? - Before you go flying off the handle hear me out. Have a seat. - This better be the mother of explanations. Maybe you can start with the God bless America crap out there. - I am a business woman. Right now the greatest business in the world is American fear. - Fear? Like immigrants are taking over jobs fear? Or like the government is taking away our guns? That kind of fear? - I couldn't have said it better myself. - So now you're actually agreeing with me? - Emmy, if someone's afraid of the dark, I will sell them a flashlight. And if they're afraid of their neighbor, I will sell them a shotgun. - And if they're lonely, you will sell them me or Lacey. - You catch on quick. - This is insane. - No, it's business. - How can I possibly work for you knowing that you're spewing that vile religious zealotry? - Who do you think we were selling to? Do you think all those men were pro-gun, pro Jesus, pro baby? - Weren't they? - Only one gentleman, the richest one was there to buy my zealotry. The others work within the confines of the dark web. - All of them were crooks? All but one? - They were there to see whether the one would buy our business, and I'm happy to say that he did. It's very much thanks to you, in part. - I can't believe my ears. - Our startup money for the escort service is set. In fact, I owe it partly to you. You really charmed him and we don't overanalyze this. We convinced one man to give us money for our endeavor. Why does that bother you? - It bothers me because it's this hateful. That's why. - When it comes to money, these people don't care where it comes from so long as it keeps pouring in. I too am in the business of money pouring in. You should be too. Look, I think we've said what we need to say. I'll give you some time to think about it. - Boy, I'd hate to be you right now. You've gotta make a choice of a lifetime. - You knew all this time, you knew about this. You didn't say a word. Why? - It wasn't my place. Look, there's so many angles to this thing and I can't explain them all. You can try. - I need a smoke. Come on, join me. Ironic isn't it, that four of the five investors are grateful for that one hateful religious zealot that wants to keep America safe from, well, Them? - I can't wrap my head around that whole thing. Who was he? - Oh, I can't tell you that. That's privilege information. But for arguments sake, let's call him Mr. E. - Mr. E, a mystery. Are you serious. - Sure. Look at it this way, everyone's happy, including Mr. E. Why can't you see what we've accomplished here? - And what is that exactly? Because you convinced one person to give you money so you could convince four other people to give you more money. It's all ill gotten gains. - Yeah. What's the problem? - You think you're so clever, don't you? But it's just a con job. - It's not a con job, it was a bluff, one that's gonna pay off really well. Emmy let me ask you, where do you live? - Like, in the city? - What country do you live in? Obviously. - It's not that obvious to Mr. E. He believes his America is gone. We're selling his America back to him. - But that just means that you're selling America to the other four investors and to everyone else. You know, like the drugs, guns. - They wouldn't be selling it if no one was buying it. In all aspects of the business model, we are providing what the masses want. - Oh yeah, all of a sudden everyone has a degree in business. - Look, I know it's a lot to take in, but that's the business we're in. Maybe I'm not the right person to explain this to you, but do yourself a favor. - What? - Go and talk to CQ before you make up your mind. But know this, we can make a lot of money together. Questions? Yeah. Why me? - Well, truthfully, I've had my eye on you for some time. - Me? Eyes on me? - Well, truthfully, we met some time ago, though you might not remember it. You saved me. So now, I did what? - Three years ago, downtown on New Year's Eve. - Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, why don't you sit down. Are you okay? - Later I found that some girl saw that man put a pill in my drink. They called the cops. It really was you that saved me that night. - I left before the cops arrived because I was 19 back then and my fake ID was good to fool bartenders, but not the cops. - After that, I had to find out about you. I found out about your freelance business with Annie. Followed you a bit. I just had to know. - I had no idea. I always thought about you, you know, I was hoping you were all right. - Allow me to show you how I am. Come with me? - Where are we going now? You'll see. You saved my life, there's no doubt about that. Here you go, Em. - I'm the type of person who rewards courage. In today's male dominated culture, that's not always easy. I gotta admit that I've been thinking about Annie all day long, what she means to me, our memories. The good, the bad. Even when I was alone, she was always there for me. How can I leave her now? - I can't replace Annie. No one can. What I can do is present you with an opportunity to repay you for that night. I can promise that I will always treat you well. Lacey can attest to that. She ain't lying. - Will you join us? - All right. I mean, but you should know that I'm totally against lies and deceit, so no more lies. Annie it taught me that a good, honest woman is worth more than wealth, power. I won't sacrifice my, our integrity ever. What do you have to say about that? - Honest ladies of the night. Sounds like a great angle, don't you think, CQ? - I'm not one to give up an advantage in business, this or any other, but I'm capable of compromise. - We're gonna rock this world. - Yes, to opportunity. - To integrity. - To loyalty. - And to making tons of money. Yes. ♪ The time is right ♪ ♪ The morning light ♪ ♪ The time is right ♪ ♪ The time is right ♪ ♪ Tonight is the night, tonight is the night ♪ ♪ I've given my all, I've given my all ♪ - Tell me Marco, what brings you to Los Angeles?
