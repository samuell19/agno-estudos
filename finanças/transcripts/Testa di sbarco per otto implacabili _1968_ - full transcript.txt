[ENGINE NOISE] -Keep your eyes open. This is only a car, not a tank, corporal. Did you hear me, keep your eyes on the road. -It's a rough road, sir. -Nonsense, if you keep your eyes on it instead of watching the sky. [PLANE ENGINE] -It's only a scout, major, nothing dangerous. And you, you idiot, you're asking for trouble, behaving like a coward. Your superior's the one who will tell you to take cover, your superior. -He saw an enemy plane. That's enough for me. -Whatever you say. -Drive on. I told the corporal to keep his eyes open. And a good thing, our life is all too short. Corporal Mueller? -Jawohl. -Take it easy, and you'll earn my appreciation by staying alert. Let's go. -Jawohl. [THEME MUSIC] [HORN] [HORN] [HORN [HORN] -These Normandy peasants are as thick as mules. You idiot! Are you going to move that thing over or do I have to clear the road with my pistol? [HORN] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Agh! -Hurry, Louie, get the hell off the wagon. -Come on. The documents. -Tell Victor to give us a hand. [GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] -Victor, go and help. -Now, give me hand with the lieutenant. -This one weighs a ton. I bet it was all that good living. -Victor, get back up on the wagon. We'll cover them up. -I've changed the photographs. You better be on your way. Best of luck. -Let's go. -Hurry, there's no time to lose. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Halt. -Put it away. -Your passing business? -Come now, you forget. -What do you mean, forget? First of all, present yourself in the correct manner to officers of the German Army. -Feldwebel Hansen Larn at your service, Oberleutnant. -Very well, what do you want? -Headquarters phoned me. There was a report of several gunshots in the vicinity. I was only investigating. And I thought that. -You mean to say that, for this, you halted a couple of officers, eh? Extraordinary. I have patience. But you've strained patience to the limit. I should report you. Now move. -Jawohl, Herr Oberleutnant. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Drive on, Mueller. We've lost too much time already. Hey, professor, a German officer never looks back. -Bother that rule, my back's a big target if they were to fire. -We've go too much to do to lose you now. -But you're assuming, aren't you, that we'll make it to this unholy Zeehar. Before, you did all right. Now the tough part's ahead. -Now you wouldn't want things to be too easy, would you, professor? But I agree with you. I wish us all well. -Your documents, please. -All in order. You will excuse the screening of superior officers, but these are my orders, sir. We are ready to move. We've been waiting for you since we received orders from our Office of Security to accompany you to Zeehar. [GERMAN] Open. -You see, professor, the Germans, themselves, will lead us to Zeehar. All those months, planning and worrying and wondering how we were going to get in, and the way it worked out, it couldn't be easier. -Then, how to find the exit. -Park over there, corporal. This way, major. -Oberleutnant Opel. Major. Follow close behind. -Mines? -Mines is hardly the word. You know what it's called by the Field Marshall? You may not believe it, but he calls it the Devil's Garden. Not even a cat could slip through without blowing itself to hell. Ah yes, we have one of your own students here, major. All he talks about is the theories of the great Professor Dreyer. His name is Captain Mahler. He'll be delighted to see you. Follow me, please. RADIO OPERATOR (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Colonel Speidel, may I present Major Dreyer. -Ah, it's a pleasure, Dreyer. -Delighted to meet you. And Oberleutnant von Getz. -A name I know well, von Getz. Your father, isn't he Lieutenant General von Getz? -Yes, sir. -Ah, ha ha, I knew there was a resemblance. We fought side by side in Greece, young man. And as boys, we fought over your mother. He won. -Yes, sir. -Would you prefer, professor, to rest a little bit? It has been a long journey. Then later, you can inspect the plant. -With your permission, colonel, it the major isn't too tired, I think that Mahler is quite anxious to show you his work. -And I am not the least bit, tired. Colonel. -Thank you, sir. Then we can go have a look now. -Excellent, it's through this door, here. I'll come with you. OPEL (OFFSCREEN): Accompany the corporal to the enlisted men's quarters. You're not coming, von Getz? -Of course. I wouldn't miss it. -Come with me. -Major Dreyer, may I present to you our young, technical genius, Captain Mahler. He has designed and directed our project here at Zeehar. I think you have every right to be proud of him, after all, he was your student. -I know I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you before, professor, but I've always followed your work and your books and scientific papers. In this respect, I consider myself your student. May I say how honored I am to meet you, this first time. If I've learned anything, major, you've done it. I hope that you won't be too disappointed in what I've done in Normandy. -Oh, I'm sure it's marvelous, young Mahler. And I wish to say that I consider you an exemplary student. -Ha-heh, you are too kind to me, professor. --Mahler! Mind you own business, will you, and hold your compliments till later. As you'll see, Herr Professor, it's their funeral. [BEEPING] -Have a look, sir. [BEEPING] -Right here. -G1, open the fuel lines. Contact. -Not a bad job, is it? Heh heh. You might say, we're planning a war reception for the Americans, should they try to land here. Take a look, von Getz. -Congratulations, Mahler. -Thank you, sir. -Much impressed. You're quite right, Colonel Speidel. If the Allies try to land here, they haven't got a chance. [EXPLOSIONS] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [EXPLOSIONS AND MACHINE GUN FIRE] [EXPLOSIONS AND MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SHRILL WHISTLE] SOLDIER (OVER RADIO): Major Dickinson, the timing on this one was dead on 15 seconds. -Can't make it quicker than that, captain. Heh, Fritz really took a beating. -You sure did, Don. But nobody was shooting back. [LAUGHTER] -Keep me covered, you guys. I'm not through with this one, yet. Be still. SOLDIER (OFFSCREEN): Get him, killer. -Damn Nazi. -That's enough, Sergeant Doss. Knock it off. Go find some other way to amuse yourself. You're too old to play with dolls. -Yes, sir. -That's it, major. -That's not it. You've got just 10 seconds to clear that minefield. If you don't chop your time down, they'll get every one of you. -Major, we've made this run eight times and haven't been under 15 seconds yet. -Lower it. -How many of us do you figure those Germans will get per second? -Too many. The idea is to hold your casualty rate as low as possible. -Fall in. -Are you positive that this setup is an exact duplicate of the original? -Sure, it's an exact duplicate. All the bunkers on that coast are alike. They've been photographed more often than Rita Hayworth. -Well look, major, we're wasting a hell of a lot of time putting those pipes together. We better figure out some other way. -I don't care how you do it. Listen to me, Jack. That bunker is there, and it's got to be taken, see. Cut it to 10 seconds or you'll get it in the neck. That's an order, captain. -Yes, sir. All right, men, fall in. Well you heard the major, one more time. -You heard Captain Murphy. -You men, this isn't a rest camp. Report to Captain Murphy immediately. -All right you guys, shake a leg out of the truck. Move it. -Heard about it? -The alarm will be circulated tonight. Tomorrow, D-Day begins, and the day after tomorrow, god willing, we land. -Yeah, god willing. -And Omaha beach, the devil's fountains? -No news yet, I'm afraid. -Who's on the job? -An officer named Strobel. I'd say he's one of our most capable intelligence men. And two Frenchmen. -Strobel? Do I know him? -I'm sure you've heard of him. For quite a number of years before the war, he was a well-known actor on Broadway. You might say he was sort of the darling of Broadway. -I'd prefer to have a professional for this show. An actor? -Don't run him down. I think a hell of a lot of him. He'll do his best. It's about all we can go on. And he will do his damnedest. -Please join me in one more, prosit. -Prosit. -Ah, the fountain is having a full test, tomorrow morning. I think the professor and I had better retire and leave you gentlemen to your pleasures. The professor may sure my room if he so desires. -I'd be only to glad to, Captain Mahler. If i may have your leave, colonel. -Please do as you like, professor. If they want to go, we let them go. After all, it meas two less to share this nectar. Prosit. Prosit. -Easy, easy. Stop pulling like that. Stop, I told you. Easy. Stop pulling. -What's wrong with the dogs? -Maybe they've picked up the scent. -You could be right, maybe they have. We'll see. Let them go. [WHIMPERING] -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] [WHIMPERING] -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] -I'll get it. -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] -Colonel Speidel speaking. -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] COLONEL SPEIDEL (OFFSCREEN): Danke. -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] [GUNSHOT] -[SINGING_IN_GERMAN] [GUNSHOT] -Agh. RADIO OPERATOR (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Soldier, you'll stand guard here. Let nobody in. Orders from Herr Oberst. -Jawohl, Herr Oberleutnant. RADIO OPERATOR (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Well you must be tired, sir. Don't you want to go to bed? -No. That is, yes. I've been doing some thinking. -I hope I haven't offended you professor. -Offend me, how? -Oh, by what I said at dinner. I didn't mean it be a personal remark. -My dear chap, I'm not offended. You must know how I've stood. All my life, I've preached against putting science at disposition of the insane. -Let's go professor. Bring the radio. -All right. Are you mad? What's that for? -Don't worry, professor. The rooms are soundproof. I just experimented. -You mean you'd kill a man in cold blood, do you Strobel? -I can't take a chance. We'd have them after us the instant that we left. I'm sorry, Captain Mahler, but c'est la guerre. It's your life or ours. -Oh. -Forgive me, Mahler. There's no need for killing. He's not problem now. Satisfied? -Come on. Let's go. Get my driver. We must leave at once. Open the door. What are you waiting for? That's an order. Open the door. -Impossible, oberleutnant. You've got to have written permission. -Ridiculous. Our orders say that we must leave at once. And this should be enough. -Impossible oberleutnant. You've got to have permission on paper. Those are my orders, sir. -Open up that door, private, right now. -I'm sorry, oberleutnant, but I can't do it. OFFICER (OFFSCREEN): Guard, open up. Your man, here, refused to obey orders. Command phoned just moments ago with the most urgent request from General Penzl to see the major. -At this hour? You must have a special pass to go out. And only the colonel can issue you that. -Colonel Speidel is in no position to issue and pass right now. -You mean that you had quite a celebration, sir? -Yeah. -Very well. I'll accompany you to the parking area. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN]. -Pull the car out, corporal. -Where are your bags, sir? -Oh, you see, we left them behind. Probably be back in an hour. -Eh, can you tell me, then, why the major needs his boot jack for that hour. -Oh, my boot jack. I, I can't imagine what I was thinking. -Now what's this all about at this time of night? What is it? Who are you looking for? What's happened? -That one. -Go, get out of this, Strobel. [WHISTLE] -Hey. After him. Schnell. Schnell. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -If he comes this way, we will get him. -Ja, ja, jawohl. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Schnell. After him. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -We're looking for him. -Not this way, sir. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SHOUTS] -That spy, has be been through here? -We thought we saw him, Herr Oberleutnant. -You can at least give me a hand. Why aren't you with the others, there? You damn coward. Schnell! -Jawohl. Agh! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Halt. This way. -Argh. -Ahh. -Denise? What are you doing here? -Be quiet. Follow me. -How can we find him this darkness? -We better find him. Feldwebel Siedler is mad as a hornet. -Let's try this area over here. Come on. -Come. -He's dead, too. And this one? -He's still breathing. -Then we'll be happy to take him with us. -No, he's too badly wounded. I'm afraid that the ride would kill him. -It is quite interesting the concern you show for him. He's a spy. He's a spy, but he's also a man. Now you remember this, until further orders, I am in command here. -Jawohl, Herr Hauptman. Then the entire responsibility is left in your hands. -I'll try to remember that, Feldwebel. Take him to my room. And be careful with him. -Come with me. -We were lucky they didn't have the dogs. -Yeah. Well, wait a minute, you still haven't told me what you were doing there? -The bodies were found almost immediately. Jean and Louie were poor grave diggers. What's that, a radio? -Yes. -You better call headquarters. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello. Well read me the message. OK. Yeah. Thanks. Good bye. Hello. Get me General Taylor, immediately. Yes. -Is it safe here? -Safe enough. You'll have to hide in the barn, though. -Ahh, if I have to. Who else is here? -Just my father. -Is he one of us? -Oh, no, he's very old. He doesn't want to fight anymore. He, He just wants to enjoy the few years he has and. -Well, you can't hold that against him. -Well, I don't. That's just the way he is. DENISE'S FATHER (OFFSCREEN): Denise! Denise! Denise! Denise! Is that you? -Yes! -Well come in right away. Something terrible's happened. The Germans are in a rage. -Dad, don't worry so much. Go back in and lie down. -Lie down, you say. I'd like to know how you would like it, to be 75. And someday you'll understand. I'll not pay for what they did. -Lieutenant Strobel will maintain constant communications with headquarters. Come over here, Jack. This is it, Zeehar. And these are the aerial photographs that were taken at dawn. You'll jump tonight. Now Jack, there is one farm which is close to you landing area, and it's a friendly one. Lieutenant Strobel made sure of that. Now this is a copy of your landing map. I want to learn that by heart. Your take-off time is 1900 hours. All set? I wish you good luck. -Thank you, major. We don't need it. -Captain Murphy, you don't seem very enthusiastic about this operation. -Should I be? -Good god, man, you'll be the first American soldier to set foot in France. -I've been trying to appreciate that fact for more than a month. I'll be damned if I can. I know it's a blow against the Nazis. We're protecting the free world, defending the men, on the 29th, from death by fire. I'm aware of those facts, major. -You really think that's the right attitude to have before taking off an operation like this? -All right, what's really bothering me is that this operation is already butchered by intelligence. Can you tell me why, once that unit was inside, why they didn't blow that bunker? You know damn well that we haven't got a chance in hell. -It was their job to locate the bunker. And it's your job to blow it. You can do it, Jack. We have it worked out to the last detail. -You know what they call this operation? -Operation Gambit. -You know what that means? It's a chess move. You sacrifice one piece to protect another. That is a gambit. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] -Who you making sandwiches for? -Oh, Sergeant Wagner, we have to keep him happy. -Yes, but don't over do it. You know how these Germans are. They'll eat us out of house and home if you give them half a chance. But you're right. I don't want any trouble. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): And now for some special messages. The meadows are green. We grow too soon old and to late smart. -Denise, turn that radio off. You know it's forbidden to listen to an enemy program. I've told you before. Now why do you do it? Honestly, you worry too much. -Well, someone has to worry around here. Now what's the matter with you? Don't you realize that there's a military ban on that broadcast? ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): [SPEAKING FRENCH] -Denise, shut if off. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): Charles has a new. -There, it's off. Are you satisfied? -Where are you going? -To take this to Sergeant Wagner. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -No other message? -No, major. -Connect me with General Pemsel. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello. Oh, it's you, Bering. What's that you say? They've just transmitted the first person of Verlaine. -A moment ago, sir. Reports indicate that the second verse will be transmitted within 24 hours. And I don't have to tell you, general, what that holds in store for us. -The invasion, according to a great many generals. We must transmit every bit of information to headquarters, Bering. -But what about local army units? Hadn't we better advise them, sir? -Just do your job, Major Bering, and leave the decisions to me. And for your information, the opinions of generals at headquarters are not always right. -So it's finally happening, the invasion of Normandy, lieutenant. That means they'll be sending the paratroopers in tonight. Do you know exactly where they're going to land? -No. They've informed me, by radio, about two hours. -Then we'll be on hand to greet them just as soon as they land. -Hm? We? Oh, no. No women allowed. [COW LOWING] -Well, what is it? -Oh, a thousand excuses, lieutenant. After all, I didn't know. She never said a thing, that naughty little Denise, not a thing. -You object? Perhaps you don't like Germans? -Oh, on the contrary, lieutenant, I consider it a great honor. -Then get out of here and don't bother me. -Just as you say. [COW LOWING] -Ahh. [GASPING] But my father's gone now. What are you doing? -You know, this sounds just like a line from a play. I bet you were on the stage. -I was in a play at school, once. -Well honey, this is dress rehearsal. -We're just about there. You better prepare to jump. -All right, this is it. -Belay that jump. We're turning back. -Hold. -All right with me. -Postponed until. Damn it all. -What the hell happened? Why aren't they jumping? -Captain. -Shut up, Doss. -They'll play hearts all the way home. -I'm missing five men and equipment. That mean anything to you, Doss? -Not to me. -Doesn't mean anything to me either. We've had it. -I can tell you what happened. Don't shoot, Captain Murphy. I'm an American officer, so stop and listen to me. This uniform is only my cover. I've got news for you. The Supreme Command has put off the start of D-Day. And for you, I'm afraid the news was sent late. And you busted my radio. -Hear that? D-Day's been postponed. But we're behind German lines, alone and without any equipment. All we can do is wait until the invasion starts. -Who says we should believe pretty boy? Why did we do all that training that we did? I came here to kill me some Germans. Make sure you leave a few for the invading force, Doss, that is if there's going to be one. We-- I'm in a hell of a mess. -I've come to help. -I'm not so sure. On the double, men. All right. Check him out, Doss. -Who are the National League champions? -The Giants. -And the leading batter? -Ted Warren. -Where's Newark? -In Jersey. -In Newark, what's the fine for a double parking ticket? -Hm? -Aha. Heh. $2.50. -Who's Charlie McCarthy's friend? -Edgar Bergen. -Junior might not be fooling us, captain. -I'm Lieutenant Strobel to you, sergeant. Now let's get going. -Bury your chutes in the woods, men. And don't leave any traces. Come on. Let's go. -I'd like to know what the hell is going on up there. -It's just a simple postponement. -But can you tell me why? -The meteorological office has stopped it. It's no one's fault. Were you able to stop the jump in time? -No. No. The message was late, by seconds. Murphy and some of his men were already off the plane. -I wonder if we can try and rescue all of those men? -Let's admit that Operation Gambit was doomed to fail before it began. It's a shame it's infeasible. Yet to order others to go in after them would be suicide. -You're right. But I'm a soft-hearted man and you know it. I still feel guilty. -This is it. You can trust the cows. -Got a cigarette. -I've seen better hiding places. All right, men, don't run off. -We'll all be safe here. I'm sure of that. We left no traces for the Germans to follow. -Well maybe you're right. But I've got a feeling, somewhere along the line, we fouled up. -Why? -I just don't like it. -I think the word for that is pessimism. -Well, I just don't want to die among a bunch of cows. -Ah, good luck. -Living amongst them may prove equally undesirable. -Phew, what a stink. But then a redneck like you, Harris, I bet you feel right at home. Too bad your sister ain't here. We could have us a little roll in the hay. -I wish you wouldn't talk dirt about my baby sister, sergeant. You all know it upsets me. -Ha, you were brought up in dirt. -Tell me, sergeant, you got nothing else to do but constantly pick on this man, huh? Now you try and hand me that stuff, and you're going to pay for it. -Listen, Foster, I can take five guys like you. Can it or I'll smash that big nose. -Sure. Sure. You might hit it. But then you'd be flat on your back. Embarrassing for you. -All right, knock it off you two. I don't even want to hear you breathe. -I'll speak to you later. -Mm mm. -I wish Sandoval were here. -Who the hell is Sandoval? -A Broadway director. He turned me down for the part of a German officer. I was the wrong type, too American. -Look, why don't forget about Sandoval and Broadway. What we need is a radio, one that works. -That doesn't make any difference. -What do you mean? -We wouldn't be able to transmit. The Germans would pick us up in a minute. -Hm. -They're experts, damn it. -We could sure as hell listen. How are we going to know the time for D-Day? -We'll have to leave that up to Denise. She'll pick it up for us. -The cows are restless this morning. Now why should they be disturbed? Do you have any idea why, Denise? Eh? RADIO OPERATOR (OFFSCREEN): Now for the. [STATION CHANGING] The rose has lost its petals. Mrs. Willis has a new beau. -Denise, for the love of god, you'll have them here. Do you want the Germans? They'll take the farm, everything. What'll happen to us then? We'll be executed. Now get away from that radio. -Get gone. No. -I will destroy it once and for all. I will. Damn that radio. Turn it off, I said. Damn you. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): [SPEAKING FRENCH] [CRASH] [DOGS BARKING] [WHIMPERING] [DOGS BARKING] -This message is genuine. I believe the bombardment will commence tomorrow morning. I just hope the general agrees. Get me headquarters, schnell. -Nothing, feldweber. -Nothing, eh? Come down here. And you, you've seen no one? -No one. -Should we have seen anyone? -Silence, Denise. -Who's she? -My daughter. -We've done nothing, so please remove your soldiers and let us alone. -Be quiet, Denise. Do as I say. -We happened to find a parachute near the swamp. -Who asked you to offer that information in front of suspects? -Please tell him, sergeant, we would never do a thing. -Do not think, man. Have the men looked everywhere? -Yes, sir. We found nothing. -Come with me. [COWS LOWING] [COWS LOWING] -Have the dogs found no tickets? -Nothing sir. -The way these cows stink, the dogs could smell nothing else. -Your insolence isn't very funny. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Is it safe now? -I think so. -But what were they looking for? I mean could I have anything to do with the parachute? I tell you this, Denise, one day it'll be the end for me. -But papa, we'll be liberated soon. -Liberated? Will you quit using words like that. You never know who's listening. -Oh. Ooh. Lieutenant, what happened to you? How did you get in there? It wasn't my fault. You must have to clean your uniform. Such a good uniform. There, there it is now. You can always depend on me, sir. Oh. -I knew war was hell. But I didn't think I'd end up in a pile of cow shit. You better hide those jumpsuits in the straw. -The Gerries. -Do you always sleep with your gun? -Yeah. -There's only one man in this outfit stupid enough to leave his parachute in the open. -Gee, sarge, there ain't no telling. [SMACK] -Dumb rebel. -And I say the man is innocent. If you say only the dumbest man in the outfit could have fouled up like that, then I say you're the one who left the chute. -You have a big beak. And you're going have it flattened out for you, Foster. -Mm mm. -Foster, put that knife away. I said that's enough. -Are you mad, the German's so close? -I gave you an order. That means now. We're not a dummy run any longer. Get back into the barn on the double. -But I don't understand. -Hey, bury this, too. -It stinks worse than a skunk. -All right, let's go. Everybody inside the barn. -You know, when I tell my kids what war was really like, you think they're going to believe me? -Oh, this is nothing. We'll probably land in a sewer next time. -And my daddy always said cow dung was good for the asthma. [LAUGHTER] -Station two men as lookouts. -Foster, over there. And you, Wells, take the window. -I'm sorry, captain, but it was the only way to keep the dogs from sniffing you out. -Well, they didn't find us. That's what counts. I don't think anyone minded. -Someone explain, tell me. Who are all these men? -Don't worry. -We're archangels of liberty, grandpa. Don't smell too good, but you're to blame for that. A little bit of [INAUDIBLE] can do wonders for your cows. [LAUGHTER] This makes collab, collaborators or us. I'm an enemy of no one. But I, I can't risk my life and the life of my daughter. You and your men must get out. -It's OK, pop, we'll pull out just as soon as it gets dark. -You'll get what's coming. -Papa. -I mean what I say, Denise. You want war, have war. But I'll have no part of it. I'm just an old man. Get out of here, understand. -I must say, the old boy isn't showing too much enthusiasm for liberation. -You're young. You have no idea. -He's really a strong man. When he was a boy, he fought. -The simple way I look at it, he ain't got any guts. -Shut up, sergeant. If if weren't for this girl, you wouldn't be alive. -If I am a coward, American, that is my affair. You haven't any right to do this to us. You must go. You must leave us, right now, understand? -We'll leave when it's dark, Maturin. I promise. -Very well, I warned you. -Where are you going, papa? -Where do you think I'm going? I must do it. Someone has got to do it. And what do they care? They'll only be prisoners. But the Germans will shoot us. -No they won't. I'll save them the trouble. -No. Don't. You mustn't. He's a harmless old man. No! No! -That's enough, Doss. You can shove your orders. You're out of uniform. Don't tell me. -Put that knife away, relax, and shut up. -If you want me to give this blade up, you'll have to make me. -I said get a hold of yourself. -This unit, it's my family. And if I have to, I'll even rip his belly-- agh! -Now get this into your thick skulls. There's only one man in command of this unit and that's me. I give the orders. You carry them out. As long as I'm alive, that's the way it is. This concludes you, lieutenant. -Yeah, and with that, the little, old one found a little old thing with wheels on, and he's taking off. -After him. He mustn't get away. -One shot. -You'll have the whole German Army on us. -Captain, hurry, we can catch him. I know the shortcut. -Get the men back inside and shut the door. -Fall back in the barn. I told. Wait a minute. -We can cut across this side. We have to hurry. Here he comes. [SOUND OF CAR ENGINE] -Down, get down! -Wait. Stop. Stop. I have information for you. They forced their way on my property. I have nothing to do with it. I'm an old man. I do no harm, I want you to know. Ah, it's the crazy one. Shoot him. Kill him. Don't let him get me. Shoot him. Please. Please. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Argh. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Gah. -Let me go. Ahh. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa. You must believe me, how could I know. I didn't know. -We'll get it. Let's get this place cleaned up. We can't. We haven't any time. DENISE (OFFSCREEN): Please, papa. -This is the main road. DENISE (OFFSCREEN): They took everything. -All right. -Denise. -All right, grab the. -Papa. Ahh. -It won't be long before they find those bodies. And it's for sure we can't stay on at Denise's farm. So we better find ourselves a new place. What do you think? -I'm beginning to think you're a die-hard optimist. -Denise, we have to go now. There's nothing more we can do. I'm sorry. You know that, don't you? -[SOBBING] -We haven't got enough trouble, now he has to fall in love. -From the look on your face, those orders concern me. And your battle is already finished, eh, Captain Mahler. -Yes, professor. I'm to hand you over to the SS. -Then I must impose and beg you for one favor more. Mon ami, would you? -Your cyanide pills? Hm. I found them, and I'm keeping them. -It's my death. -You're a Nobel Prize winner, Professor Aubernet. You have too much to give to the world. It would be stupid to die like that. -If it'll make you happy, I'll live until I'm murdered by your Gestapo. -The fact that I'm wearing a German officer's uniform doesn't mean I'm not a human being. I'll make you a deal. I'll give you your pills, but only when I'm absolutely convinced that you're right. -This is far enough. Spread out. -Mama always said don't walk in water. It's bad for the dogs. -Dogs is the name of the game, so they won't smell us. -Nothing. You sure you got that message straight, Denise? -They transmitted the last second verse. [SPEAKING FRENCH] -Well, lady, that doesn't mean a thing to me. -It signifies that the Allies will land tomorrow morning. -If Denise is wrong, we've had it. -But I am not wrong. -Then why don't we hear any planes? It's past midnight. If you're waiting for the rest of your men, don't. They aren't coming. The big brass probably think we've been taken prisoner. They won't be dropping any more men here, captain. -It isn't the most strategic position, but we can hold up here until the invasion begins. -You mean that Operation Gambit is out? -Way out. -I guess it is. Unless we want to try it alone. Maybe it's professional pride, but there's nothing worse for an actor than to blow his first night because of the electricians pulling a strike. -I know, Strobel. You took a hell of a risk getting inside that bunker. You know the layout. We all know the risk the 29th is taking. But you're forgetting one, simple thing. Explosives. You see that door is three inches thick. Figure it out. -I think I know where we could find explosives. The castle at Houtenay is full of ammunition. -Hear that? Well, captain? -On your feet, men. Up and off it. Now, you men have been wanting to see a French castle, French girls. You're going to get your chance. We have a job to do in the next village. So get your equipment. Ron, you line them up. -It's not far, only a few minutes away. -All set, captain. -You're not coming. -But why? -You've done enough. Just listen to me. Now you know as well as I do what, what the mission means to the invasion. I'll come back. I promise. MURPHY (OFFSCREEN): Let's go, lieutenant. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN]. -The building over there. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] Halt! -[SPEAKING_GERMAN]? -Jawohl, Herr Oberleutnant. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] [MUFFLED CRIES] -Uhn! [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE] -OK. -Achtung! The Americaner! [GROANS] SOLDIER (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING GERMAN]. -That's it. Let's go. SOLDIER (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING GERMAN]. [SCREAMS,_MACHINE_GUN_FIRE] -On the double. Let's go. -Over there. -Hyup. -Give me a hand with this. -Yeah, yeah. -Over this way. -All right, move it then. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Argh. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -Ahhh! -Get over there! [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_CRIES] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -All right, let's move. -Yeah. [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_SCREAMS] [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_SCREAMS] -Ahh, argh. [GASPING BREATHS] -Ahh! -This is our course. We have 12 355s in the War Sprite 9 381s from the Romulus. That's enough to blow a cruiser out of the water. -Except a cruiser is 400 feet long, commander. And it's a hell of a lot wider. -Compared to the dome of that bunker, having a diameter of just nine feet? Damn it, anyway, if we hit it, we deserve to get the croix de guerre. -Hey, my hands are shaking. Give me one good reason why my hands should be shaking? -You're not the only one. -There. -That should blow a hole in it. -Ah, captain, well, everything looks all right. And, uh, don't worry about that mine field. We'll make it. -Hell, Strobel, you've been through it and back. We'll follow you, once we get by the wire. -Think these cans of beans are going to blow that big, old door, captain? -And more just like it. Move out. -Come on. And don't drop it, OK? [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE] -It's almost dawn. It'll be light fairly soon. We could sure use some tanks. -The ambulance has arrived at lookout one. Jah, jah. Jawohl. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] Is the prisoner ready for transport? -Jawohl, Herr Feldwebel. -Very good. Come. -Captain, are we thinking the same thing? -They've got to come out again. -What the hell's happening now, Bering? I have reports that the partisans are attacking. -It would appear that they were not partisans, Herr General. You see, sir, one of the attackers was found dead in a US Army uniform. Obviously, General Eisenhower has condemned his men to suicide. They can't do much harm. Only ther must be a reason why they would suddenly send paratroopers. -Of course. I understand. They want Zeehar. Yes, I know the bunker's heavily guarded. But they'll do anything to get to it. You must do your best. In the meantime, I'll send you reinforcements. -Feldwebel. [GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN] -[SPEAKING_GERMAN]. -Inside. Inside. Shut the door. [SPEAKING GERMAN]. [EXPLOSIONS,_MACHINE_GUN_FIRE] -Leave the door, professor. You've got to listen to me. -Hngh. -Schnell, inside. Hurry. [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_SHOUTS] [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_EXPLOSIONS] -Come on. -Agh! -Agh. -Argh. [MACHINE GUN FIRE, EXPLOSIONS, SCREAMS] -Help, here. [MACHINE_GUN_FIRE,_EXPLOSIONS] -Argh! -Schnell. Schnell. -Aaah! -All right. -Ready? Go. -Ohh! -Agh! What are you hit, the leg? -Yeah. It's OK, -Let's go. -Ohh! [SCREAMS] -Ahh! -Ohh! -Over there. Give me a grenade. Go on, move. -[SPEAKING_GERMAN]. Quick. -You're OK, Ryan? -Yes, sir. I'm fine. -Well, Captain Murphy. You'll have to admit, it was spectacular show. -Well, Strobel, I believe you can say that we made it. I must say, I never. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] -When the door blows, get in there, quick. [SCREAMS] [EXPLOSIONS] -Don't shoot. We're Americans. -Glad to see you guys. But you just might as well start heading for Paris, lieutenant. The war's over here. [MUSIC PLAYING]
