God does not suffer. He doesn't feel pain. He is not a courageous God. Human beings can be courageous or cowardly. Neither of these things is in God's nature. Will man destroy the earth to move on? Is that his Destiny? Ask yourself a question, people- Are you humble before God? ...Believe in the one true God. Ezekiel saw the wheel, but what kind of wheel? The cigar-shaped hubcap from the Sky? Are these the gods that created mankind? People, there are many gods. It is written in the bible that there are many gods. Does the bible lie? These gods left before the bible was written. Would you swear on a bible? I'd swear on a bible. A book of treachery and murder and genocide. Of course I'd swear on that, and I'll tell you why. The false Christianity you subscribe to Is nothing more than the cult of the virgin. People, it's time to evaluate and reflect on your lives. God has turned his back on this nation. Think about it. What did Martin Luther King get out of the whole thing? A boulevard? It's the dark princes, The democrats and republicans, Working for a barbarian That can scarcely spell his own name. Hey, the only thing more pleasant than seeing you Would be seeing the grim reaper himself. You gentlemen are about to make a hideous choice. You two are pitiable figures, weeping with blood, And it's going to be your own blood. Are you aware, gentlemen, that this is all a play? We don't want paper money. We want gold and silver. Okay, listen. Uncle sweetheart is organizing a benefit concert... A benefit concert To help the real victims of this revolution, However, I will be personally siphoning the majority of the funds Into the kitty of the fattest cat of all, Me, And you gentlemen will be paid in full. When? Definitely in this lifetime. Look, you got the money or not? I understand you're not accustomed To staring into the face of God. Shut up. I can't. As long as I keep talking, I know I'm still alive. There's no use talking to you, huh? Yeah, ain't no point in listening, neither. I'm not going to debate semantics with you. Look, it's real. It's beyond phenomena. They're shooting and killing. I mean, how do you define war in this day and age? What are they fighting about? I don't know what they're fighting about. I mean, do the Hindus, Arabs, Jews, Irish, Muslims, Buddhists Know what they're fighting about? The last person who actually knew that Was killed a long time ago. They're all religious wars. Look, we've got dead aliens Stacked up in warehouses. What else do you want to know? We're talking about a war with no technological spin-off. It's an uneasy puzzle to solve, gentlemen. So why a benefit concert? Well, how else do you get rock stars To do television, huh? You either give them a cause or you give them an award. Hmm? What happened to you? What happened to me? How far back you want to go? So where's my headliner, huh? I just got off the phone with the network. They want something to promote. They need something to promote. They have some questions about your ability To perform services due. And I suppose you told them I was a total show biz stud. That you have total mystical knowledge And Faith in me, And absolutely no question About my ability to perform services due. Yeah, yeah. Something like that. So who are we getting, huh? We getting any important people? You know, headliners? Top-of-the-line performers? Maybe. Could be. You never know. Should I believe you? Of course. Yeah? So, now tell me, Are we screwed, Or are we not screwed? Oh, I'm not. Are you? I don't think you are getting screwed. That's your problem. Yeah, yeah. I can't believe You're going to turn this disaster Into a seduction. This place bugged? Uncle sweetheart, We're fighting a war here, In case you didn't know. War? Don't tell me about war. I fought in the granddaddy of all wars, The war to end all wars. The one to rip your heart out. Look, honey... Honey, I'm on your side. My side? Everyone I've ever met, I can look in the eye And tell what side he's on, So let's stop the spiffy chatter. I'm on my way to a meeting At the network. They have a much greater reach and resonance Than even they themselves might suspect. Well, for the love of humanity, we must limit their power. Ha ha. You don't take any of this seriously. Yes, I do. Look at me, being all serious. Hmm. No, look. No, wait a minute, here's the thing. I don't think sting or Springsteen Or Billy Joel or McCartney Is going to work out, But, but, but... I have a surprise for you. I don't understand what just happened here. Where are the headliners? The big waves, big names, superstars? Well, what's to understand? There's nothing to understand. They're not here, they're not coming. Do you mean to tell me After all this time, We wind up with Jack fate? Jack nobody is more like it. He was over before he started. Are you finished? We're all finished. You know, ultimately, We didn't have the money in the budget To attract a big name. You said we did. Yeah, well, then, I was wrong. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Something is starting to smell here. Something is giving off a very bad odor, And these fumes are starting to choke me. We can do some very ugly things. I could have you killed right now For the price of a cup of coffee, And everybody in this room Would turn the other way. Hey, can we stop kidding around here, now? I think we should pull the plug. Plug? There's no plug. You show me a plug, I'll pull it. There's no plug, there's no socket, There's no wall. If I'm going down, I'm taking the wall with me. By the way, Jack fate, He isn't a blood relative, is he? Shut up, valentine. You think you're going to get off cheap With Jack fate... But believe me, the price will be steep, And one more thing. If you want to suffer agony for someone else's happiness, Do it on your own time. Now, go away. Fate! Fate! You're getting out, Jack. Somebody sprung you. Must be my lucky day. Who'd have done that? Some angels must have intervened on your behalf. Maybe a bunch of people put their savings together. Hell, I don't know. Haven't felt free in a long time. Keeping people from being free Is big business. I'll keep it in mind. Open it up! Hey, Jack. Jack... Where you going? Roswell. You don't seem to understand. When they heard Jack fate's name mentioned, There was complete silence. Like reverence. Like prayer. Yeah. I was doing the praying. They wanted to cancel the whole thing. Don't they understand who Jack fate is? Nobody knows who Jack fate is anymore. Nobody cares. I mean, he doesn't make records. He doesn't go on tour. He doesn't do interviews. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't have to. He's a legend. Does Jesus have to walk on water twice To make a point? Besides, he's virtually free. Who else can you say that about? Virtually free? No one is virtually free. You're either free or you're not free. You know, if he's going to play this concert, Then he's going to play exactly what we tell him. Hey, prospero. What's happening, man? You missed it. Two eagles just killed a pregnant rabbit. Hmm. Rabbit must have done something. Leaving town? Yeah. Oh. By choice this time? Not really. Nothing ever really is. Where you heading? That way. That's a good direction. I've done that a lot. One of my favorites. You know what else is good? That way. Maybe next time. Think there's going to be a next time? For you, maybe. So, you ever coming back? I did come back. This bus going across the border? No, sir, you're going the wrong way. All right. What are you drinking? What am I drinking? I'm drinking my life away. Why? You want some? Make you forget that you're poor. Yeah, but I'm not going to have any. So what's up? "what's up?" Isn't that an interesting question to ask me? I've got reporters wounded. I've got reporters that are held captive, Held hostage. I've got two reporters dead. I've got reporters on the front lines. I've got reporters that are, uh... Undercover with the insurgents, With the counter-insurgents. I've got people inside the capitol, Even in the office of the president himself. Yeah, I've done all that. Yeah, you've done all that, And people are still dying out there, my friend. Everybody's doing the killing now. Everybody's doing the dying. Where does that leave you? Are you still a journalist, or are you a novelist? Same thing out here. So, what's this all about, huh? I've got things to do. I've got my awards, I've got my scars. I've got nothing to prove to you. You'll never change. There's a benefit concert. A benefit concert? For medical relief. It's going to be broadcast on the network. Government controls the network. I just want to make sure It's not a pr thing, That they're not trying To make themselves look compassionate, Or that it's not some kind of a set-up Or a nefarious ploy to weed out the rebels... But I will tell you this. There is a story there. That's no story. That's no story. That's every story. That is the story. Make something out of it, And if you can't do that, sir, Then make it up. How much time do I have to do this? I don't have a lot of time. Jesus Christ, man. You don't have a lot of time? Abraham Lincoln... Listen to me. Abraham Lincoln gave the famed Gettysburg address In five minutes. Five. So don't ever talk to me about time. There's... Something else. Only one performer. Only one? Yeah. One. Try that on. You don't need more than that performer. Okay. I changed my mind. About what? About what? About everything. Everything? Every... Thing. Enjoy it, Because this is your last shot. Arise, o Lord. Save me. Arise, o Lord. Save me. Arise, o Lord. Save me. What's the matter? You look disturbed. Yeah, Because there's always something the matter, Right? I don't want there to be. You don't understand. You can't stay honest out there anymore. Shit. Why? What's changed? I'm going to be gone for a couple of days. Maybe you shouldn't be here when I get back. Where are you going? I want to go. Don't we always have a good time? Yeah, good times don't last long. You're making everything so tragic. Tragic? I'm not making it tragic. Every period in history Has been more or less tragic. I don't know what you're saying. Don't you read the paper? The pervert's going to be the top man now. The man of the hour. Tommy, If you had to kill somebody, how will you do it? With a gun or with a knife? With my bare hands. Look, It's an overcrowded world. It's hard to get to the top. There's a long line at the elevator. Doesn't matter. We'll take the stairs. Let me go with you. I come from a small village in the mountains. We don't even have a doctor, So I joined the rebels. I didn't know what the answers were. I still don't. I just knew you had to take sides. I suffered sickness and wounds. My whole family turned against me. They disowned me. I tried to explain, but... But they just wouldn't listen to me. Pretty soon, I saw the rebel movement was corrupt. The leadership were lying to the people. They wanted to replace the old government With a new government which was just as bad. They were taking people's money. They were making promises With no intentions of keeping them, And then a small army of counter-revolutionaries Battled the rebels in the mountains Where the government forces weren't effective. I changed sides. No one ever noticed. This new movement was fighting for the truth The rebels supposedly believed in But really didn't, And then I realized That this movement was being funded By the very government I wanted to topple. At that point, I realized I didn't want the government to fall. It would only be replaced with anarchy. I started believing in preserving the republic, So I joined the government forces. I fought bravely for the cause, And then one day, We wiped out a small village. They told us something About the rebels having infiltrated. It was a lie. All the men were either dead or old... And there... And there was nothing but women and children left. We... We... It was my village. And, uh... Sometimes when I dream, My dreams become my reality, And I wish I could live in my dreams. Do you ever dream? Yeah, I dream. My dreams are walking through fire. Intense heat. I don't pay any attention to my dreams. Does he know about the concert? Of course not. Shouldn't we tell him? Of course not. Did you hear who the headliner is? Look, I like Beethoven. Stravinsky. Chopin's really good. Modern music doesn't do much for me. Quite frankly, It doesn't do much for the president, either. At least it's not some banjo player. Anything we should do? If they would have gotten a big star To headline the concert, We might have had to take action, You know, But they didn't get a big star. Big stars think it's too dangerous here. Big stars, you know, they like doing benefits, But only if the benefits Are held in places Where they won't get shot at. Oh, man. Let me ask you. You ever met any big stars With a set of nuts? With any big balls? Any goddamn brains or charisma? Huh? My man, big stars, they like... They like it safe. They don't like to put their life on the line For a cause they don't understand. I mean, who does, huh? What do you want to do about Jack fate? Nothing. Hey, Jack fate doesn't understand anything. Besides, he ain't a big star. What's going on? Who are those guys? They're the, uh... They're the counter- revolutionaries. They've stopped the bus. What do they want with the bus? Anything they can get their hands on. They might just harass us, They might let us go, they might... Kill us, They might make us join them. They might drug us. I don't know. You know, it's... Violence is the only thing they know. It's the only tool in their box, And you can't build a house With one tool. I've got a tool too. Hey! They have no ideology. They push both Jesus and Judas aside. Once he was a real father, Full of love, compassion, and forgiveness. That didn't last too long. After a while, Being a father didn't amount to more than an official title. He sacrificed everything he ever wanted To reach his Destiny, To rule this empire with an iron fist. From the cathouses and gambling joints, He Rose to the top rung of civilization, President of this godforsaken nation. Hey, do I need to ring a bell To get a refill? You see, my glass is empty. Yeah, The glass is always empty. So is the spot on the counter Where the money's supposed to be. Tell me, who in the hell Is presiding over this slaughterhouse, huh? You or me? Look, tough guy. You want the world to be flat? It's flat. You want it to be round? It can be round. You son of a bitch. I know some things too. Yeah, the more you know, the more you'll suffer. You've got that right. Hello? What? Jack? How am I doing? Man, I didn't think I'd ever hear from you again After that night. I thought that- No, I'll leave now. I'll be there by morning. Is this for real? I'm on my way. Hey, man, no hard feelings, But I'm sure the next Guy that serves you a drink Is probably going to draw the same conclusions. It's on the house. He's not here. How do you know? Because I don't see him. How do you know he's not like Claude rains In that movie the invisible man? Who? He doesn't show up, You'd better get invisible. This place looks familiar. I think I stayed here before. Well, welcome back. Your pen's still out of ink. Not a problem, sir. You here for the concert? Yeah, isn't everybody? Oh yeah. Will you be in need of a woman, sir? What kind of woman? We've got all kinds. Slave women, immigrant women, Black women, white women, young women, old women, Rich, poor, middle-class, free women, Western women, northern women, Southern women, Intellectual, Radical women, modern... They run the gamut. Which kind would you like? I'm just tired. Can you give me a room? I'm going to give you the same room Nixon slept in The night before he made that famous speech to the press. "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." I'm going to give you that room, because it's got The most comfortable bed in the house. Okay, I'll take that room. All right. By the way, What side of the political fence are you on? I do not belong to any political party, sir. I guess you could call me... A feminist. Sir, your pen? It's filled. You have reached The official residence of the president, Built in 1714, burned down in 1809, Rebuilt in 1818, Burned down again in 1841. Hello? Hello? Some of us pursue perfection and virtue, And, if we're lucky, we'll catch up to it, But happiness can't be pursued. It either comes to you or it don't. You can always say, "if only this," Or "if only that," But "if only" is a state of mind That we get into when we feel deprived. In my father's world, you do not take what is his... Not his gold, not his silver, not his woman. I thought I was doing it for my mother. I thought I was doing it for my country. Ultimately, I knew I was doing it for me. In the end, It's the strongest arm that stretches the bow. Hey... Give your uncle sweetheart a hug. Hey, you're all skin and bones. Aren't we all? Anyway, I don't have to throw my weight around. Look at you. You must have put on a few pounds. Eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Let me show you this place. I own a piece of it. Which piece? It changes every day. Come on, sit down. There's a chair. Plant your ass in it. You look good. You've got the jail pale. It suits you. So what do you got cooked up, Sweetheart? What's your angle? This is going to be a patriotic rhapsody, Jack. Here's the deal. You'll be working for the people, The peasants, the children. Imagine yourself being reincarnated In the civil war in Babylon. Civil war in Babylon? Come on, son. Snap out of it. You've got to stand up on your tiptoes To see the future. Look, man, this is our big Chance. Another big Chance. Yeah, that's right. You do this show, this benefit. It'll be seen all over the world. You put your career back on track, Maybe a tour, maybe a record, Maybe both, Make a little money and save the world All at the same time. It's all politics, Jack, And money is the mother's milk of politics, And we'll be a-raking it in. You know you're not going To make any of them things happen. So? So what? So, will you play? Of course I'll play. You know I'll play. Well, good. I already told them you would. You couldn't get anybody else, could you? That didn't even cross my mind. It didn't even occur to me. Nobody could be like you, And a great many have tried. I just know this is going to come off. I need some boys who can play. I got some musicians right here. Feast your eyes on simple twist of fate, The best, and only, Jack fate cover band in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, We have a special treat for you this evening. Not only do we possess the twist of fate, We possess the cha-cha, the boogaloo, And the watusi of fate, Jack fate! Yeah! Whoo! The only power the government has Is to crack down on criminals. When there aren't enough criminals, You make them. You make so many things a crime That it becomes impossible to live Without breaking laws. How'd they ever get you to do this? They must be scraping the bottom of the barrel. I might have a few songs left. You wouldn't try anything, would you? I got a lot of respect for a gun. You create a nation of lawbreakers, And then you cash in on guilt. That's the system. That's the game. Once you understand that, you'll sleep a lot easier. Remember, life is like riding in a taxi- Even if you're not going anywhere, The meter is ticking. Beautiful animals. Oh, thank you, But it's God deserves the credit. They don't have time to bother with success or getting rich. They don't have fantasies of glory. They don't borrow money to buy things That decrease in value while they own it. See, they're beautiful because they just are. They do what they do. A lion don't try to be a tiger. Rabbit don't try to do an impression of a monkey. They don't try to be what they're not, Unlike us, us human beings. The cheetah, the tiger, the snake, the monkey, The baboon, the muskrat, the bobcat... The pig that's fat, The hippo, the rhino, the dodo, The honey badger, The slithy toad. Each one, each perfect in their own original forms. Then man came in- Who created him and for what purpose? Still a mystery. Why is he here? It's a mystery. We know he's trespassing. Doesn't know his own place. Of course he doesn't know his own place. He don't have one. Man, the bear-hunter, the fur-trapper, The deer-chaser. Man, the bear-hunter, the deer-trapper, the, the... Man, the bear-hunter, The f-fur trapper. Man, the-the-the deer-chaser- Baby-seal-clubber. The dolphin-snagger. Lowest form of existence. He's a rabble rouser, He's a stir-upper, agitator, Goes around sticking his nose where it don't belong. The zoo, the aquarium, They are-they are prisons for the animals. These animals cannot learn anything from mankind. Man doesn't have a thing to teach them. I abhor looking at human beings. Disgust me so much With their atom bombs and blow-dryers and automobiles. They build hospitals As shrines to the diseases they create. Human beings alone with their secrets, Masked and anonymous. No one truly knows them. If I see a crack in the sidewalk, It's more beautiful to me Than any human being. A crack in the mud at the bottom of a sun-dried dead lake, I count that more beautiful than any human being. You know what I mean? I know what you mean. Kind of like a curse, isn't it, being born? You got that right. Yeah, because we live in fear, Because we know we're going to die. Animals don't know they're going to die. They got no fear. They live content In the moment. Holds us back, Knowledge of death. I say amazing Grace indeed. Oh, man. I'll tell you something else- Ancient cultures, civilizations, Used to sacrifice animals, Like cattle and rabbits and goats and such Instead of human beings. Now, today, we do it the other way around. We sacrifice the human being, Like the Incas, Like the Aztecs, like the big corporations. Amazing Grace indeed. Hey. Howdy. What was that all about? The guy's into animals, I guess. Come on inside. I want to show you this place. You'll like it. Sure. Right up your alley. The networks are really behind this. They're putting up a lot of money for this deal. It's a bitched-up world, Jack. The only way we can protect ourselves Is by going mad. I'm not going to kill you. Some famous star from the jazz age Was disfigured Right here on this stage during a live show. Uh, what the hell was that sucker's name? I can't remember that guy's name. I don't know, stagger Lee? No. You want to know what really, Really gets my goat, though? I mean, all this talk About race this, race that, Ethnic this, ethnic that. I mean, when you come right down to it, There's really only two races- Workers and bosses. That's it. Hey, man. You hear what I'm saying? Yeah, you said the same thing last week. I told you he was here, and you were worried. Miss Veronica... Meet Jack fate. Oh, yeah. I had one of your first albums. It's a shame. It's one of the things my husband took During the divorce. So, are you ready for this? I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Look, I've got a few things to do. I'll see you later, maybe. I hope you've got this cat's priorities In order. Have you explained the restrictions, The limitations, the boundaries, huh? The rules? We talked about it. I hope you know We're dealing with the here and now. You can't compare the here and now With the there and then. I don't care what he's done in the past. Calm down. Everything's under control. Are his songs going to be recognizable? That's what I want to know. All of his songs are recognizable Even when they're not recognizable. Don't worry about it. We know right where we are, Where everything else is. We don't chase after things that are out of reach. Ooh! Ooh! You're so spontaneous. Howdy. Troubles... I don't talk about my troubles while they're happening, I'll tell you about them when they're over. Anyway... I slept like a log last night. I got so much shit happening, man, I'm going to turn this here thing Into Woodstock, Altamont, the Beatles at Shea, Live Aid, And the Elvis comeback special all rolled into one. We'll see, we'll see. I know what you think, man, But I feel good about this. I feel like someone who's lived 10,000 years, Has 17 senses, And is standing ankle-high in the Atlantic. Well, I hope you pull it off. Wait a minute. Who's that? Just the greatest human menagerie Since the Stone age At our services. No mediocrity here. Totally beyond criticism. I got all the acts here Who are going to round out this show And fill up the Bill. Come on in, come on in, Jean darkness, Dolly, the rubber girl, Eddie Quicksand with Milo, The great el Mundo with Ella the fortune teller, And our shooting gallery of beloved world leaders, Jean Paul Deuce, Mahatma Gandhi, And our own beloved Abraham Lincoln. Come on in. Come on in. Hey, you put on a couple of pounds. Don't call that home number I gave you, dolly. Here they are, Jack. Friends, thank you all so much for coming, But Mr. Fate and I Have some fiscal business to discuss, So if you could all step out To the holding area, There's refreshments out there. Just see Ollie, our stage manager. Thank you so much. Hey, cookies. Oh, Milo. Hee, hee, hee, hee. Oh, lookee here. Lookee what the cat drug in. Bobby cupid, How'd you get in here? Jack, did you know he was coming? Where's your passport? I don't need no stinking passport. The land's too big out there, man. After a while, it starts to swallow you up. A billion years of weather and wind. I got a surprise for you. Wait till you see this. What's that? That, my friend, is blind lemon's guitar. Where'd you get this from? Well, I've been saving it for you. How do you know it belonged to blind lemon? Because I got it From this old boy's house in Dallas Down on the fifth ward Near where lightning used to live. Blind lemon gave it to him When he was leading him around. Looks like the only thing you could play on that guitar Is solitaire. This is one of the guitars that started it all. Looks like something I could go out to the corner pawn shop And buy something just like it. Well, maybe you could, But it wouldn't be like this one, Because this is the one That played, "matchbox blues." Oh, "matchbox blues." Just like me and you, Jack we got so far to go. Yeah.. I'm going to go and put some new strings on this. See you later! The later the better. Did you ever notice when you dream, The dream seems to span several hours, But actually only lasts a few moments? No, not really. I'm looking for Jack fate. Is he in there? Who's looking for him? The name's friend, Tom friend. I'm with the press. Who are you? What do you do? I'm a mechanic. Well, I'm a writer. I got an assignment to cover this so-called fundraiser. I'm looking for Jack fate. Hey, you ever read for whom the bell tolls, Hemingway? There's a guy that could write, you know? Yeah, I read it. I need to see Jack fate. Are you gonna make my job easy or difficult? Well, I don't know anything about any fundraiser. Get word to him that I was here. Can you do that? I'll be back. I don't know. This say anything to you? Hmm? Not a thing. No. I'm hungry, Tommy. Are you hungry? Let's go get something to eat, okay? Thank you very much. He seems like a good person. Yeah, pretty much. They want you to sing that song, "revolution." You know, the Beatles' song? The slow version, the in-and-out one. Oh, "revolution." What else do they want me to play? I got the play list right here. Let's see, where's my glasses? Okay, here we go. "revolution," "street fighting man," "I won't get fooled again," "cell block number nine," "Ohio," "Eve of destruction," "kick out the jams." You could do all those. No, no, no, sweetheart. Sounds like a lot of songs. Look, son, you blew it before. This is your big Chance. I'm trying to get your career back on track. There's people out there Giving prizes to people like you. Prizes? Yeah, people are impressed By people who win things, Don't you know? Ain't that the truth? Look, son, I'm trying to be on your side. Just let me. You've got to be born on my side, sweetheart. Oh, behold, the dreamer cometh. What's going on, dreamer? Well, there's some guy out there snooping around. He looking for me? What's he look like? What's he look like? Well, he's got a fu manchu goatee. He's with some weird half-breed chick. Looks like a leech, a bleeder, some kind of two-faced monster, A spy. Well, that's a good attitude. You can tell all that just by looking at somebody? Yeah. Well, a guy does all kinds of things To give himself away. He said he was with the press. Lee? He probably would have had him shot. Sherman would have hung him. Well, maybe we should talk to him. We could use some publicity. Who does he want to talk to? He wants to talk to Jack. Well, maybe you ought to talk to him, Jack. Exposure can't hurt. Well, if you ask me, his pen's sweating blood. Well, nobody's asking you. Look, Jack, I'm doing my best. I'm trying my hardest. I'm only human. I know. It ain't easy being human. No, sir. Where have you been? Well, they bumped off another taxi driver. Had to walk. What's going on out there? Police are trying to bust out some political prisoner, Or bust in and take some damn child molester out And hang him from the lamppost. Hell, I don't know. What is it, Tommy. What's bugging you? What's bugging me? The absurdity of a lifetime of futile labor, That's what's bugging me. Condemned to some pointless task. I'm trying to track down some guy, Ask him the meaning of life. Look at that crowd down there. Life is the meaning of life. Your problem is That you're always looking At the bug on your windshield, And if you keep looking at it, You're going to miss the whole scenery And have an accident. You've got to look through the windshield, Not at it. What's that? The dictatorship, It's getting worse day by day, And newspapers, they're just a false map of the world. Did you ever hear of the aids epidemic, huh? What if I told you It was cooked up by some mau mau men in Africa And they gave it to British sailors? What about the Vietnam war, huh? You ever hear of that? What if I told you It was lost in the whorehouses of Saigon Instead of on the battlefield? How do you know that? never reveal your sources. Be careful, Tommy. The light in your brain will go out. I never thought I had a brain until now. Hey, Jack. Tom. Friend. Tom friend. I'm with the press. Oh, I know who you are. I know who you're with. Great. Long time, huh? Uh... You mind if I ask you a few questions, Clear up a few things? Not at all. I don't mind, uh... Ask away. You got a smoke? Uh, no. No, I don't. What do you want to know? What do I want to know? I want to know a lot of things. Like what? Well, I know you had a twin brother. What ever happened to him? A hunting trip. Yeah, well, Jack, That doesn't explain anything. Well, he never came back. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Now, it won't hurt you To answer a few questions. Nobody has to answer any questions. No, this will do us a lot of good. Let's just keep it simple. Just tell him what he wants to know. What does he want to know? Can we keep it short? Yeah, we can keep it short. Okay, Jack. I've got a few things here. What about... Mothers of invention, Jack, hmm? Zappa? Now, there's a guy, He wouldn't take "no" for an answer. He did that whole movie, uncle meat, 16 hours long, totally unedited. He let it all hang out, didn't he? What about you, huh? You ever let it all hang out? It always has been hanging out. You know that singer In the group the bee gees? Yeah, he sounds a lot like, uh... Gene Pitney, doesn't he? As opposed to who? As opposed to who. "town without pity." you remember that, Jack? Hmm? That place where they'd lock you up For doing something You haven't even thought about doing yet? It's a pretty lonesome world, isn't it, Jack? Hey... This here's supposed to be About a Charity fundraiser, right? Yeah. Yeah, okay, let's wrap it up. What about... Hendrix? Remember Hendrix at Woodstock? I'm just curious. You weren't there, were you? You weren't at Woodstock. You weren't up there with Hendrix. Why? Where were you? Hey? You should have seen Hendrix, man. He was all business. Didn't mix business with pleasure. Playing "the star spangled banner" Through two lousy speakers To a half a million people in the mud? What a cry that was. Cry forlorn. Yeah, one desperate cry for freedom Up there with that screaming guitar. Now, what was he saying, Jack, hmm? That "star spangled banner" trip? Now, what was that all about, huh? Revolution? No, I don't think so. You could hear tears in every note he played, Saying, "love me. Love me. I'm not a traitor. I'm a native son." He took that glorious anthem... He dropped drug bombs on it. You could hear that cry around the world Saying, "hey, I'm an American citizen." He was calling out to his forefathers, Yeah, the pilgrims. Pilgrims... They didn't need any stinking passports, Did they, hmm? Hendrix, Jack, he was the last man standing. Pride and honor, right, that's what it's all about, But, um, no, they didn't hear him. One sad cry of pity in a town without pity. Now, what about you? What do you think about that? That's what I want to know. Would you reach out to a drowning man? Would you think while you were doing it That he might pull you in? I think this Guy is way out of line. Hey, hey. Who wants a drink here, huh? Anybody want a drink? I want a drink. Tommy. Tommy! Tommy, I've lost something. Hey, wait a minute! Maybe we could still work this out! This... Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. We can work this out. I got my story. We ain't working nothing out. Come on. That was all off the record, you know? Nothing's off the record. Come on. Here, have a drink, become part of the club, Have a swizzle, Become a member in full standing. Thank you very much. I don't drink. I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink. Oh, I get it. You're one of them hot corn girls, ain't you? You got a lot of self-control. Freedom is only for those Who practice self-control, right? Ain't that what you're thinking, right? There he is. Go on. Come on. He won't bite you. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fate. Who's this? This is Mrs. Brown, And she's got a lovely daughter. My daughter has memorized all of your songs. Why did she do that? Because I made her do it, that's why. What do you think of that, Jack? Used to be she'd be sweating away In some factory underage, And now we got child labor laws. All these kids, We took them out of the factories, Put them in the streets how about that? Anyway, she wants to sing for you. She wants to sing her little heart out. Go ahead and let her. Go ahead, darling. If I know nothing else, I know at least one thing is true- That the sacred is in the ordinary, The common things in life. They tell you that everything is nonsense, That the laws of nature are nonsense, Gravity is nonsense, Relationships don't exist, jobs don't exist, Everything is up for grabs, And there's no cause of anything. That's what they'd like you to believe. I guess you could say that I was pushed downhill, But my fall from Grace didn't end At the bottom of those stairs. It went on, and it seemed to go on forever. Expect the worst, and you'll get it. That's about all he ever taught me. All of us in some way are trying to kill time. When it's all said and done, time ends up killing us. Isn't she Precious? Come along. Mr. Fate has work to do. Come along. Get out of my chair, man. Jesus. All right, so... Here are the lyrics for "jailhouse rock." The executives are insisting That this song be sung, okay? "jailhouse rock"? Why they want to hear that? Well, look at the lyrics, man. Here, give it to me. Uh, where is it? I don't know. It's something about a party That the warden's going to throw in the... County jail. They see it as a song of hope, you know? Some, uh... Some kind of egalitarian thing. They want to plant the seeds of hope. A lot of people try to plant The seeds of hope. Yeah, but the seeds won't grow if you plant them on the carpet Or a hardwood floor. You've got to put them in the earth. "jailhouse rock," Jack. What do you think? I don't know, sweetheart. You ever heard of cellulose? Cellulose? Yeah, cellulose. It's in the grass. Cows can digest it... But you can't... And neither can I. Jack, I screwed up. I screwed up big-time. That's one thing about you, sweetheart. You don't do nothing small-time. Shut up. I'm not talking to you. I got a couple of guys chasing me down. I made them some promises. Promises are hard to fulfill. Well, I had to borrow money, Jack. I did a stupid thing. I borrowed money to buy something That's been decreasing in value Ever since I bought it. Ain't that a bitch? You live and learn. Don't you understand? I'm trying to get clear of my mistakes. I've got a family, Jack. I'm not going to be a burden on my children. Oh, don't leave, Jack. Look, you know I'm not some vicious person In a position of wealth and power. You're like a chemist who invents a new drug And doesn't care about the side effects. I'm in over my head, Jack. You're nothing but a piker, man, A door-to-door encyclopedia salesman. You'd commit treason against your own self. Who's talking to you? Common sense. The voices inside my head. That's who. I mean, screw this so-called concert, Jack. These cats here, They're just addicted to lights and sound. Man, let's go someplace Where we can see the earth and the Sky. Let's go to the south seas. Let's go where Gauguin went And just disappear for a while, Because this guy here, He's like a praying mantis. He don't kill his victims, he just- Hey... I don't know which one of these voices Is coming out of your mouth, But tell it to shut the fuck up. Gauguin was a stockbroker. Let me borrow the keys to your car For a while. Yeah? Hey, whoa, don't threaten me. Lucius, why are you hassling me? I told you, we're in this thing too deep To make a change like this On such short notice. Hey, sweetheart... Well, well, well, well, it's two scavengers. Somebody must have left some food scraps lying around. Your bones break easy, you know? My father controlled a lot of things, A lot of people, But he couldn't control my mother. I can tell you one thing. She never loved him either. It wasn't a marriage. It was a masquerade. She could love no one, not even herself, And he loved somebody else. My mother tried to love me, But I think she was trying to kill me. I don't think she recognized me as her son. It was like I had become a symbol Of everything that had gone wrong in her life, In her world. I wondered if you'd ever return. I wondered if I'd ever seen you again. You were pretty beaten and banged up that night. That was a bad night. You never resolved it with him, did you? Nothing to resolve. You going to try to straighten it out with him? You think you can? It can't be straightened out. Will never be straightened out... Not by me, anyway. Then what you coming back for, Jack? He's on his deathbed. I got to see him. I'm tired of not seeing him. I want him to see me. You gave it all away, didn't you? You gave all the best of you away. Yeah, I did. I gave it all to them sons of bitches, Either unwilling or unable to accept it. Yeah, we all did. You want to go see him, you better go now. I hope it's not too late. Me too. Look, don't you forget... A home is a refuge, A warm place for the heart and mind. What can I do for you? I want to do something for you. What can I do? It's been a long time, Jack. Yeah, it's been a while. So much happens In such a short time, don't it? Seems like only yesterday. Maybe to you. Remember when we were kids, We used to play in the back out there. My mother cleaned this house. My father took care of the grounds. We were illegal back then. We ain't illegal anymore. We're in charge now, Jack. I remember your ma. Wonderful lady. Used to ask permission before she did anything. Yeah, before she cut a leaf off a flower, She'd ask permission. Couldn't wash away the real dirt, though. No. Nobody could. I'm the man your father always wanted you to be. I'm the next president of this country. Yeah, that's something, isn't it? You seem pretty convinced of that. Well, you know how it is, Jack... When inferior people want to revolt, they do. When they become equal, they want to be superior. You're looking at the top man now, Jack. This ain't no dog and pony show. We're not just a couple of macho men From the flea market. Sweetheart, that's it. I'm pulling the plug. I'm not going to wait any longer. Wait a little longer. No. What harm will it do to wait a little longer? He'll show up. I know he'll show up. Let her pull the plug. What the hell's the difference anyways? What's going on? Are you canceling the concert? I get my exclusive, sweetheart, right? You made promises. I did? Yeah. I don't remember, I got amnesia. Hey, big promises, buddy. Get the hell out of my face. Hey, I got one for you. What did the monkey say to the leopard At the card game? "I thought you were a cheetah." He's good. He's great. I love his songs, because they are not... They are not precise. They are completely open to interpretation. You got any idea what that song was about? Yeah, it's about trying to get to Heaven. You got to know the route before you start out. No, it's not about that at all. What strikes you about the song Is the Jekyll and Hyde quality. The song is written from Hyde?s point of view. That's what you like. It's about doing evil And trying to kill your conscience If you can. It's not like those other songs of his, The ones about faithless women And booze and brothels and the cruelty of society. It's not like those. This one's right up your alley. It's about doing good By manipulating the forces of evil. It's just like you. Geologists in Trenton Are digging the world's deepest hole And have reached the depth of 30 Miles. Scientists have measured the temperatures down there- They have lowered microphones into the pit And heard the sounds of millions of suffering souls. Dr. Samosa at the project management center Has determined that the center of the earth Is hollow. "hopefully," he says, "whatever is down there will stay down there." In the west, rains- What have I been doing? Pissing and missing the ball? I owe you an apology. You've been avoiding me, man. You don't need to avoid me. I just want to know a few things. I want to ask you a few questions. Who's making the money on the concert, hmm? You know, whose pockets is it lining? Remember Janis Joplin, huh? The Judy garland of rock 'n' roll? Now, she took it all the way, didn't she? Lord, all she wanted was a Mercedes Benz. You know, what pipe of power you smoking from? Come on, man, tell me. You're supposed to have all the answers. What makes you tick, man? You like people to fall on their knees, right, And fall all over you, huh? I don't do that. That's why you don't like me, right? How much they paying you to trot around the ring? What about the king of the sexual revolutionaries, huh? Hefner, the son of a bible-thumping Baptist? How does that Guy figure into this? You're supposed to have all the answers, man. Come on, huh? Sexuality is more revolutionary Than any ideology, and you know it. What, you think Good and bad are irrelevant? Tell me why. Who's your true companion? Who makes your life easier? Can you at least answer me that? I'm on your side, okay? I'm going to put your story On the cover Of the London times, man. You need the publicity. You know that. You been to England lately? It ain't so English anymore. The empire is finished. You know, they got the big Ben and the tower, But it's just a theme park. Jeez, you got your start there, man. How does that make you feel, that the empire is finished? What do you think about that? That's what I want to- Hey, man, I'm on your side. It depends on your point of view. Hey, I don't want to be here any more than you do. I doubt it. Hello, Jack. Do you know me? You look familiar. I was the star of the show here, One of the biggest stars. I was one of your father's favorite performers once. Everything was going great As long as you kept your mouth shut, But he was doing things that were wrong, your father. His desire for retaliation and revenge Was too strong. I was the only one Who was in any position to say anything. Everybody else was too scared. I had the show, I had a forum, so I spoke out. It's not what goes in the mouth, it's what comes out that counts. They said it was an accident. Some even said it was a suicide. Some people choose to die in all kinds of ways. Some people jump out of buildings And slit their wrists on the way down. Some fall on their own swords. I opened my mouth. Do you remember? My name is Oscar Vogel. Oscar Vogel. Well, I've got to get back to the stage. The stage... Ah, yes. The stage. The whole world's a stage. What's the matter, huh? Come on. We're behind schedule. We've got a problem here. Too much electrical load. The voltage at the output terminals, They're undergoing a decrease. So, can we do this? Can we start on time? We're all over that. We're going to... Yeah. Yeah. We're all over it. 30 seconds. Five. And three. And one. The president is dead. The president was a brave and strong man. His principles and beliefs never wavered, And which we must continue to strictly adhere to And carry out In accordance with his last wishes. At the moment, We are giving people a new identity And erasing the collective memory. We are rewriting the history books. Nothing was more important to our president Than bringing peace to this war-torn country... Peace, a lasting peace, That can only be achieved through strength, So in my first act as the new president, As the leader of this new government, Of this new regime, We will begin immediately to deploy troops In the southern region. We will resume bombing in the jungle. There will be no more violence from the organized media. Real actual violence Will take the place of manufactured violence. We will empty the prisons And we will build the football stadiums, And the evildoers from the prisons Will be trampled by wild elephants, Mauled by uncaged bears, And pecked to death by screaming eagles. Furthermore, we will alert the rebel leaders That the negotiation's finished. There will be no more compromises, No more concessions, Just complete and utter unequivocal surrender. We have learned a valuable lesson- Great nations do not fight small wars. There will be no more stupidity, No more mistakes. It's a new day. God help you all. We are living in a tawdry and vulgar age. What do you think? Yes, we are. You know, when the Roman empire fell, You know what Caesar And the rest of them Romans were doing When the barbarians was at the gate? What? They were shooting craps And gambling. Gambling is a waste of time and energy. You know, if you build a casino, You've got build it like a fortress In case there's a police raid. I suppose. Can I offer you a drink? You want to be sociable? No, I don't drink, I don't drink, I don't drink. Just one little sip of nectar? I don't drink, I told you before I don't drink. Come on, you're not on duty. I said no. Come on, you can get to the truth of things. Discover the riches of a wise and good life. Well, I stay as I am. Don't you want to live forever? Put a little liquor in your blood. Come on. No. No! She don't want a drink. Oh, look who it is! The sultan of sleaze! The thing that came from outer space! Where'd you come from, the world's fair? We're having a conversation here! Your day's over. There's no more conversation. Look, son, I was selling porno books Out of the trunk of my car before you were born. Don't tell me I've had my day. You're the scum of all scum. You never should have been born, you pickled punk! Maybe it is your day. Tommy, let's go home. It's not too late. Let's go. Yeah, it's always been too late. Look, I won the jackpot. The booby prize, huh? A dead dog! He's done nothing to you. You're going to try to protect him? You're going to try to kill me? That sack of shit? I wouldn't spit on him, him and his monkey lying tongue. He's screwing you over like- Aah! Once when I was passing a cathedral, A white dove came flying by And dropped a twig it was carrying in its beak At my feet. This guy's gone. Somebody better call the meat wagon. You better get out of here. Go out the back way. You coming too? No, I'm not. I'll see you later. Oh, man, I had no idea it'd come down like this. How could you? All right... Anybody see anything? Anybody? Yeah, I saw it. I saw it all. I was right there. He did it. What? Shut up. He did it. I was right there. I saw it all. He's responsible. I mean, it might have been a random act, but... I'll tell you what- You could put his whole life on trial. For everything in life you do, sweetheart, There's a price. You pay it up front, in the beginning, Or you pay it at the back end. Oh, yeah. I was always the singer, and maybe no more than that. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things. Sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well, Like what does it mean to not know What the person you love is capable of? Things fall apart, Especially all the neat order of rules and laws. The way we look at the world is the way we really are. See it from a fair garden, everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau, And you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. I stopped trying to figure everything out A long time ago.
