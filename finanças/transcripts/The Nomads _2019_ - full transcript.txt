Save our kids. Save our schools, save our schools, save our schools. It was an emotional evening as you can imagine if your child's school was going to close, you would be here to make that final plea before the vote. We want to thank everyone for coming out today to share your thoughts and fight so passionately for our schools. No part of this process has been easy or was ever taken lightly. Bullshit! These are children, you should be ashamed! Ma'am, please. The fact remains that too many of our schools are financially failing and in an alarming state of disrepair. Our first priority must always be to keep our students safe. With that in mind, the board has voted to close and integrate the following 23 schools. Edward W. Bok Technical High School, Carroll High School, Community High School, Douglas High School, Germantown High School, Lamberton High School, Vaux High School... What do you mean Vaux? Damn, man! Alexander Wilfred Elementary, Rideover School Elementary, Pat Elementary... ...after officials voted Thursday night, to approve the closing of 23 Philadelphia public schools. During a heated three-hour meeting, 19 protestors were arrested and charged for disorderly conduct. Emotions ran high as teachers and students shed tears for the schools they once called-- - Hey. - Hey. Saw it on TV. To the end of an era. Not in the mood. Fine, then to new beginnings. You already got something, didn't you? Let's just say charm goes a long way at Immaculate Heart. Immaculate Heart, wow, look at you. Yeah, they seemed really excited to meet a real, live Jew. Whatever, I'll take it. So, what are you thinking? I hear Whitman needs a new history teacher. - Rent is due tomorrow. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up. You teach English. Relax, I'll just brush up on it. - OK, then Whitman? - Did you forget already? 23 schools just closed, I'll be lucky if Whitman takes me. OK, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get you into Immaculate Heart. It'll take some maneuvering, but I will. - Until then-- - What are you doing? I am bequeathing you one of my most prized possessions. Ah-ha! Your favorite pepper spray, it's adorable, but don't forget, I'm not a rookie. I mean, how bad could it be? ¶ Going to lit up the bong, it's night fall ¶ Excuse me. Sorry. Don't you just love first days? Mark Nolin, nice to meet you. Cassey McNamara, but everybody calls me Mac. Any advice for my first day here? Nice, I was about to ask you. I'm from Lamberton High, rest in peace. So, let's see, first days are tough. Suddenly, I'm teaching 10th grade math after a career as a science teacher, but none of that's advice, is it? All right, well I'll have to get back to you on that. Thanks. All that before 8:00 a.m. Jeez. I'll take the vodka. Wow, here we go. Did you get the flyer, did you get these? OK, good. Everybody, let's get to class, OK? - Watch it, Fishtown. - What'd you say to me? I said, move first before I slap the shit out your fat ass. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Let's get to class. Get to class. OK, first things first. Does everyone have their trans pass? I know some of you have a longer commute now, but this card means you have no excuse not to be here. Hey, sorry I'm late. I need mine. Oh, sure. And, your name? Where'd he go? Jeez. All right, take a seat. I'd steal my pass too, if I was that fast. I can barely fit into this small-ass desk. Excuse me? I think you're smart enough to use better language than that. Revise it. All right. Hi, what's your name? Kahlil Smith. Sorry I'm late, I'm new here. Lucky for you, Mr. Smith, a lot of us are new today. Take a seat. I think it's safe to say our Olympic sprinter was... Banner, OK. My name is Miss McNamara. Welcome to your senior year and American History. We'll be starting with the War of 1812-- Yo, there's a fight in the cafeteria! Wait no, all right! Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats, stay-- Welcome to Whitman. ¶ Scram track ¶ Trey, let's move. Hey, hon. Hey. One of those days, huh? Yeah. I got a new local crafty, you'll like it, it's strong. Mm, don't threaten me with a good time, Ellie-Sue. And, can you put on 427 for me, please? - You got it. - Thanks. Goes back for the inside, back against and he flashes through the line as easy as he likes for a try. This young man is a true testament to the power of coaching forward against all odds. Now, this is rugby at its finest. Now, that's a try. Knock, knock, we're still here. How was your first week? Let me see... a fire, three kids arrested and a cafeteria fight. You tell me. I'll see those, and raise you 55 kids in my second period class. 55, can they do that? Not contractually, but that would suggest we actually have a contract. Kids are sitting on the window ledge. Sittin' on the floor. Is that you? You're a rugger, I knew there was something I liked about you. Do you play? Yeah, at my last school I started a rugby program with a friend of mine who, when the school closed, went on to big time rugby coaching and... I'm here. I've been playing since I could walk. I would go to all of my dad's games when he coached. Where are you from again? South Philly, why? McNamara? Is your dad Barry McNamara? You're little Cassey, aren't you? Oh my, your dad, your dad gave me my first coaching job. I remember when you were adopted. Everyone was so excited, oh my god, I am so old. Your dad was the best mentor I had in my entire life. Dad was happiest when he was playing, but even happier when he was coaching. - Totally. - I miss him. Go, go, go, break it up, break it up. - Enough! - Whoa! It's done. Hey, move, move, go! - I'll see you later! - Go! Turn those phones off, do you want detention later? Wow. That's why my friend KJ and I started the team, as an outlet. Moved the scrum from the hallway to the field and the results, they were incredible. It's a crime that program was cut short. When I started my college team at LaSalle, it was like a steam valve for frustrations. I was focused, it improved my grades. Yeah. A lot of great memories. Speaking of memories, how's your mom? Love that lady, she was at every game. I wouldn't know. So, what does Mrs. Nolin think of you out drinking on a school night? Ah, I've been divorced for years. This guy doesn't have a curfew anymore. I think Whitman this year is gonna kick my ass. - I'm too old. I am. - No. I gotta stay positive. - Yes. - Here's to staying positive. New friends, your father, and rugby. Rugby. What do you mean you're gonna start a rugby team? I'm gonna try. So how much will we be getting for this gig? - Hmm? - Nothing? You don't have enough on your plate relearning history? Seriously, why? Because I'm a good teacher, but even better at rugby and my kids aren't set up with a cappuccino machine like yours. Maybe I can start like a barista team there. Just don't get too attached to that place. Yep. No. Are you frickin' kiddin'? We can barely buy books around here. But the great thing about rugby is that it's a zero equipment game. All the kids need is a ball and a field. Oh really, that's all you think they need? They also need a safe place to push their boundaries. We have a very big football team for that. We do. Too big. We just combined three schools, two full teams of football players are now screwed. An unfortunate side effect of the closures. Exactly. Which means less opportunities for college and scholarships. A lot of great rugby scholarships out there. I can't even remember when our graduation rate passed 60 % and you're talking scholarships. Let's change that percentage. We hired you to teach, not coach. Yes, but isn't it our responsibility to challenge them to try new things? Take the scrum from the hallways to the field? "Scrum," I'll assume that's a rugby term. Yes. Mr. Nolin, you equally committed to this? Dr. Wade, when I was a young man, I coached with Mac's dad, and it changed my life. If it does half as much for these boys as it did for me, I want to be a part of it. Well, let's see if you can get any interest first. Trying new things is not the status quo around here. - Now out. - So, that means you'll get approval from the school board. I'll see what I can do. - So, that's a yes? - Get out. - OK. - Shoo. - Thank you. - Thank you. Rugby, guys? There's a role for everybody. Hey... rugby? Come on, man, it's fun. Rugby. Hey, first of all, hood off. You interested? Take a look. No? All right, give that back. These things were not cheap. Rugby... no? Rugby, three o'clock... Nope? OK. Are you sure? You'd be perfect. Come on, bro, you're fast. Come on, you got the hairdo for it. Rugby, it's room 23, three o'clock. Rugby. Rugby... Yes, thank you. You'll get your pass after class. - Rugby? - Yeah. It's kind of like soccer, ain't it? Nah, it's like a wussy British version of football. Rugby is neither of those. I'm too small for football. I just said it isn't football. And it's not just for bigs. Fast kids are important on the wings and we can use someone with your specific set of skills. Think about it. Hey, I ain't wearin' no short shorts. Well, if you don't want someone yanking on them when they tackle you, you're gonna wanna wear 'em. I ain't got no money for no cleats. Listen, if money is an issue, then you have no issue. We'll figure it out. - OK. - Yes! Thank you. - All right, all right. - Sorry. Look, you might not thank me after I'm done. The district won't give you any money or resources and I have none to allocate to you. No problem, Nolin and I will handle fundraising. My buddy KJ is gonna give us practice balls, pads. Also, administration... Insurance, liability waivers, permission slips, grade point average minimums. Great, paperwork, bring it on. I love it. Is that all? Mmm, I think I'm done. But I do want you to know that I'm really sticking my neck out for you on this. Do not make me look bad. Now out. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. - I'll take one. - See you soon. Woo! All that for this. It's OK, just relax. Kahlil. - What's up. - All right, we got one. Oh, here we go. Hey, how's it going? How you doing? - Good to see you. - Welcome. Nice. Jeez, we got a bunch here. Sweet. Great, well I'm glad you guys could make it. So what, we got two football teams now? What, no, this is for rugby. - Rugby? - What? OK, yeah, I may have handed out some fliers that said football. - They were confused and I thought-- - He lied. Just you know get 'em to hear us out. Hmm. Well, if you're here because you love football, I have great news. Rugby is the first version of football. It's a game of passion, excitement, action, and beauty. Beauty? - No, no, wait. - Hey, guys. OK. "Beauty?" I mean, like most great things, the more you explain, the worse it sounds. - Let us just show you. - OK. You know, rugby is one of the most popular sports in the world. Much bigger than baseball and football. This is called the Haka. It started as a war dance. It's a challenge to their opponent. It's also a celebration of life over death. This New Zealand team, the All Blacks, they were the underdogs of rugby. Now they dominate. Their connection to the game is unmatched. There is another Haka that's my favorite and it loosely translates to "This is our land that rumbles. This is our time. This is our moment." What are they doing? This is called a scrum. Players from each team bind together and push against each other for possession of the ball. Nobody's puttin' their hands up me like that. That is called a line-out, and you would probably be doing most of the lifting. All right. Or maybe a hooker. What? What'd you just call me? Take it easy, O'Brien, it's a position in rugby. You get to slam into people without pads. This jawn for real? Yeah, this jawn's for real, O'Brien. So, kindly sit your jawn back down. Thank you. I don't know this. All right, this is a team sort of. No, Kahlil? I thought for sure he'd show up. We could play sevens. Yes, definitely, sevens, without a sub. - But it's a good start. - It's great. Did you all bring your workout clothes? You're gonna practice in jeans? I run from 5-0 just fine in these, we don't need no short shorts. "Any." You don't need any. All right everybody, pile in and let's go find our field. - 8th and Poplar. - All right. - I call shotgun. - Shotgun. Man, this ain't no field, this jawn's a prison yard. But it's ours, come on. I mean this... it's not so bad, right? I mean, we can work with this. We're from Philly, right? Don't we need goalposts or something? We can use... that. Come on. Everyone put these on and pick up 10 pieces of trash. I mean 20 pieces of trash. Come on, guys, let's do it, let's make this place an operating room. Man, this is just nasty. Hey yo, if I get caught with this, they gon' lock me up again. Where you belong. Hey. Thank you, I'll take that. Look, everybody come in. Come on, take a knee. We have some basic team rules before we can even get on the field. First, I'm not your mother, so don't expect me to treat you that way. For that matter, Coach Nolin is not your father. Coach Nolin's hella white. All right, listen up, fellas. You respect yourselves, you respect each other, always do your best. Look around you, this is your crew, this is your team. You could be somewhere else, but you're here. So, let's pick up the rest of this trash and let's play some rugby, let's go. Yeah! We're gonna start with a nice, easy pop pass. Ball! Secure the pass, turn around, look for your man. - Ball. - Talk to each other. Remember, in order to move the ball forward, you have to pass it backwards. There we go, that's it. Line up, let's go. Let me show you guys how to tackle in rugby, all right? Step up, O'Brien. I want you to tackle me at my hips. Wrap me up and drive through, let's go. What, what are you doing? What is that, what's going on? Yeah, I don't tackle no girls. Ooh. All right, then let's switch it up. Who here thinks they can get past me? I got this. Woo! It's about to go down. This ain't the hallway no more, Coach. Whenever you're ready, Baby J. Ready. Damn! You just knocked down, young boy! Don't mess with Coach Mac! You good? All right, guys, bring it in, bring it in, come on. Bring it in. All right, not bad being our first practice and clean up gig. We'll be pushing you much harder tomorrow. Jaymie, break it down for us. Whitman on three. - One, two, three. - Whitman. All right, guys, don't go home empty-handed, pick up those pads. Mm-hmm. The Sioux Nation were nomads or without any fixed home base. To them, the land was sacred, they had no concept of private property. I will see you all tomorrow. Kahlil, can you hand back a sec? Close the door. Have a seat. So what's up? I graded your test from yesterday. That's your second D. I swear I study like crazy. I believe you. How's it going in your other classes? It's OK to ask for help, got it? Yeah. I was surprised that you didn't show up for rugby. You seemed more interested than anyone. I know, but I made varsity, well sort of. It's a big team this year, huh? How many are on the roster? - 85. - Wow. Is it hard to get playing time? Honestly, each of us is just fighting for a chance to wear a uniform each week. Well, if you change your mind, I can guarantee you plenty of playing time. Just think about it. I'll write you a pass. - Here. - Thanks. Have a good day. On coach's whistle. Hop into your defensive stance, elbows at your side, eyes forward... ...run back to the cone, do it again, let's hit the ground, let's go. - First one up. - Come on. - What are you doing? - Come on, O'Brien. O'Brien, go. Right now, go. You wanted to hit people, here's your chance. Up, forward. There we go, a little high, a little high. - Go lower. - Next. - Eyes forward. - Yeah. - All right, see what you hit, guys, see what you hit. - That was good. A little lower. Nice. Lead with your shoulder, lead with your shoulder. All right, Sergio. - I think I'm done, Coach. - You're not done, go back. - Start again. - Nice and low, nice and low. - That was great. - You're never done. You're never done. - Yeah, nice. - Yep, lower, lower. Ride through your hips, tackle two feet behind me, all right? You can always do better, let's go. O'Brien, get up, right now, get up! You got this. Come on. Nice! Banner, step up to O'Brien. O'Brien, wrap him up, take him to the ground. OK, Banner, present the ball, keep a skinny gate. All right, great. All right, Jaymie, clear him out. - Go Jaymie. - Come on. Stay low, grab a leg, drive through the hips, there you go, nice. John Nathan take the ball. Here we go. Brian and John, spread out, support him, let's go. Play the ball on my whistle, all right? Nice! And that is your first ruck. Nice and tight, come on, get in there, get in there. Grab his shorts. Nice. - Nice. Tight. - Crouch. O'Brien, when I roll the ball in, you decided where it goes. Come on, man, what are you doing? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, take a deep breath. Listen closely. The secret to training in life: Difficulties, setbacks, always moving forward. You hear me? Now, let's do this, go. All right. Round up again, nice and tight. You got it, grab his shorts. Crouch. Nice! There we go. So, after a try, you get a shot at conversion kick. It's two points. Something like that. - Ooh! - Nice. Beautiful. A'ight, watch this. That's a drop kick, ball hits the ground, you got it. Hey, guys. Hey, hey, it's OK. Nice distance. Come back, come... Hey, you, oh, oh, oh. Sorry. Yes, lunch time study sessions are mandatory. Don't study, don't play. Yes? What if we get decent grades? Why we gotta be here? Man, your grades are whack. Man, shut up, ain't nobody ask you. Because this team is not just about rugby. It's about holding each other accountable on and off the field. You work hard together, you succeed together. And if Banner doesn't pass Algebra II, then he can't play and if he can't play, we don't even have seven. Which means no team. Hey, start gettin' to class or I'm gonna track your Haitian ass down and make you. Got it? And since you're all seniors, next week, we'll start talking college applications. She drawlin'. Damn sure ain't goin' to no college. Again. OK, let's go. John Nathan play the ball. Ho, ooh! Watch those hospital passes, come on, keep it low. Jaymie, don't drift, stay straight, make the defender commit. And if he doesn't, you just go straight up the field. - All right. - Right? - Let's go, again. - Let's try again. You got this, bro. - He got you. - He did, he did. He got you! Oh, that was nice. We'll give you that one time. - Good job. - Right, reset. That's enough celebrating. - Get back on it. - That was good. Hey, Kahlil, hang back a sec. Sit with me. Damn! Damn is right. Kahlil, I have a short test I'd like you to take. Another? I'll just fail that too. It's not that kind of test. I asked a school aide about it, it's just an assessment. If we know what your challenge is, we can deal with it... together. And I'll even let you take it now, so you can skip your next class. All right? Cool. Let me ask you something, between us. Let me know if any of these ring true. Do you sometimes confuse small words like at or to? And, is it hard to read out loud? After you read something, would it be hard to explain what just happened in the story? Do any of these sound familiar? OK. So, we'll need a full assessment with an aide. But I think you might have dyslexia. What? So, you're saying I'm stupid. Stupid? Not at all. I mean would you call Muhammad Ali, Steve Jobs or Magic Johnson stupid? I've got more. Why don't you come to our lunch time study sessions we have with the team. That could give you some strategies to help you. And I'll set up a meeting with the aide and your parents. I'll go with you. OK? Hey. Look at me. There is zero shame in this. Everyone has something they have to deal with. Now, you have the information. That gives you power. A'ight? A'ight. Now get out of here. Thanks for having my back. That's my job, isn't it? Talk, talk! Run, run, run, run as fast as you can. Run, run, run. If you watch the pros play, they get cards put on them all the time 'cause they don't give a shit. Language, Tuna, one more time and you're going to Wade. Shit, sorry-- I mean sorry! Guess you make me feel comfortable, Coach. So, sort of your fault. Oh, is that so? So, using your math, I will make the whole team do five extra laps at practice later, so that's sort of your fault. Come on, Tuna, shut up, man, why you always talkin'? Come on in. Does everybody know Kahlil? He'll be joining us for study sessions. Ça passait. All right. - Yo, Jaymie. - Yeah, what's up? Between me and you, what you think about this rugby stuff? Ain't for no sweet bulls, that's for sure. Homegirl straight dropped me at the first practice. She for real, bro. All right, bet. - Catch you later, a'ight? - No doubt. All right, bring it in. Looking good, guys, looking really good. - Take a knee. - Hydrate. So, thanks to O'Brien and his love affair with profanity, you all owe me five laps. Damn, man. Come on, man, you always talkin' your mouth. Oh, you don't like that? What about a little challenge then? This whatchamacallit is a speed parachute. You strap it on, and you run like someone stole your wallet. We'll do double or nothing. If one of you can run from those pads past this tire in 10 seconds, zero laps. If you can't, 10 laps. Any takers? Ooh. - Yeah. - You funny, Tuna. Give me that thing. Yes! He thinks he's fast. OK, coach, on your whistle. Let's go! ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ 'Cause you a fine Amazon ¶ ¶ On the ground, deep cred ¶ ¶ But I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ 'Cause you a fine Amazon ¶ ¶ I'm on the ground, deep cred ¶ ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ That counts, that counts. - 9.58. - Yeah! ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ I'm takin' no L's ¶ ¶ 'Cause you a fine Amazon ¶ ¶ On the ground, deep cred ¶ Good. That was amazing. Everybody, take a knee, we have an announcement. Drum roll, please, Coach Nolin. We have our first scrimmage against St. Vincent's Prep next week. Ooh. They have a good program, big roster. They work really well together as a team. I wanna show 'em what we got. Since we don't have no uniforms, can you guys just wear all black t-shirts. Like the New Zealand team, their warm up is nuts. - OK bring it in. - It's called a Haka. Whitman on three. - One, two, three. - Whitman! Let's kick some rich butts. Let's just do our best. Guys, we need some help here, we got some equipment to pick up. What? What? O'Brien, Nathan and Jaymie, all right, let's go. Too late to join? What about football? They got 84 other players, they'll be all right. I bet you can learn the rules pretty quickly, huh? Already been watching up, Coach. OK, let's go. Looks like I found our sub. Excellent. Kahlil, all right. Looks like O'Brien lost his starting spot. You're so funny. All right, we're ready to go. Nice. ¶ All like breakin' up and lovers ¶ ¶ Baby you look when you walk, ooh ¶ ¶ Baby your love That feeling left with me ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ All right, y'all let's go. Coach, how much do you think it costs to go to this college? Tuna, this is a high school. - No shit. - Hey, language. The field's right there, but we have to head inside first. Wow, this is nice. Hey, Coach, that's for us? Sure looks like it. Don't have to tell me twice. Hey, O'Brien... Guys, hey. Come on, don't eat too much, you won't be able to play. Man, I knew it, this joint a trap. Who cares, they have name brand bread. - Ah. - Let's get out to the field. Come on, come on, guys. Come on, we got a game to play. It is a pretty nice spread. These chocolate chip look pretty good. Let's go. O'Brien, come on, come on. Jeez, you opening a bakery or something like that? Whoa. Huddle up, guys. They're huge. Leave it all out on the field today, OK? Win or lose, they will not out-work us, yes? - Yeah. - I wanna hear you say it, yes. Yes. All right, Whitman on three. - One, two, three. - Whitman! Let's go. Get out there, come on, O'Brien. Fire up. - Attack the ball, let's go! - Nice kick. - Great hit. - Spread out! Move out! OK. Go Banner, go Banner. - Come on, Banner! - Come on. OK, we're learning. We're always learning, always learning, right? We gotta work on staying flat on D. You think so? Come on, boys, let's go. Line up for the kick off, yeah! We gotta go again. Talk, all right. Yes, yes, yes, go left, go left. No, go left. - No, no, no, Banner, what are you doing? - Got a whole to pass it to. - You can't outrun seven people. - The hell was he doing? Line out. - Line out. - Line out, guys. - Line out. - Come on, guys. Pick him up. - Jaymie. - All right, all right, - spread out, guys! - The game's still going, go! Go, go, go, go! Patch up. - Throw your man. - Come on, guys. - Run! - Oh! You watching this, Kahlil? Cramp. Hey. You OK? - What's wrong? - Cramp. Jesus, man, I told you to take it easy with those hoagies. All right, you'll be all right. OK, Kahlil, you're in. Stay present, anticipate their run pattern, always tackle low. One second. By the waist, OK? Go! You can't eat and play rugby. OK? You can't do both at the same time. Let's go. Catch up. Come on, take a play. - Call it out, call it out. - On your back. Oh, did you see that? Pick up the ball, pick up the ball! Run, run, run! Banner! Did you see that? All right, guys, get back up, let's go. Come on, guys! That was beautiful. Spread out, heads up. Match up. What, that's bullshit, man. Chill, man. Man, shut up, ain't nobody asked you. Jaymie. - OK, guys, bring it in. - Come on. - All right guys. - Man, what are you doing? Hydrate, hydrate. I eat when I'm stressed. Why don't you try it, might calm you down a bit. Leave him alone, Tuna's not the one giving away penalty points. I don't see you scoring to keep up. - Ain't that your job, Haiti? - Stop! If someone would give me the ball on the outside. - Chill out, man. - And what are you talking about? - You're not even on this team. - Hey, yo, what's up. Yo! Remember me, your coach? We need to pull this together. Look, you are playing the best of the best here. This team ranked second in the state last year. This is your first scrimmage. This is a hard game, that's why it's worth playing. Now get out there, keep your heads up! Play your best! Look out for each other, and show them what North Philly is all about! - Now let's go! - Let's go! - Come on. - Come on! Tuna, put that sandwich down. Tuna! Line up for the return. Don't bunch up, come on now. Woo! Watch the quick restart. What you lookin' at, he's fine, he's fine. I think we should pull Jaymie. O'Brien, go in for Jaymie. What, he's fine, he's fine, come on, he's good. - You can't hit him like that. - Yes, I can. You high tackle like that, you could kill somebody. It's stupid. - What'd you call me? - Chill, chill! Here we go. Hey, hey, hey! - Forfeit. - No, come on, man. We forfeit. Go, go to the bench now! Turn around. Go! I hope you're proud of yourselves. What was that? Listen, Coach, I'm really sorry about what happened out there. Great game, thank you. Sorry about that. They'll be OK. Look, you guys come back when you're ready, eh. Thanks, coach. Take off your headphones. Take off your headphones, now! Well? What was that? Man, them boys was trash. Thought they was better than us. Yes, they were better than us. Man, forget that. Forget all this! Jaymie, you're pissed at yourself because you know you messed up. The first person to raise their fist to anyone will lose. Look at me. - You got me? - I got you. We started this team because we believed in you. You're bright, capable young men. Now you need to act like it. More importantly, play like it. Let's go. Hey, Rocky, get in, I'll give you a ride. It's far. Well, then you should definitely get in. Come on, it's getting late. Oh yeah, that's better, old head music. What you know about that, young buck? It's coming up in a few blocks. You could drop me off here. No, no, door to door service only. Let me walk you to your door. Coach, don't get out of the car. I don't care where you're from. Is that you up there? Yeah, moms has people over a lot. I'm sorry about earlier today, I lost it. I just know you're better than that. How you know? You don't know me, Coach. I know you were locked up for dealing, and that doesn't define you, Jaymie. You have choices, you always have choices. You're a strong player, I see you playing in college. I mean I like rugby, but for real, most of us ain't going to college, especially me. Aren't. What? Aren't going to college. You'll never get in if you keep saying ain't. Well, you aren't funny. Touché. Thanks for the ride, Coach, I'll see you at school. Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie. Come on, let's bail. Maybe that kid Jaymie is right. The last thing you want is to get them excited about a life they'll never have. Well, that's depressing. I should just prepare them for jail? I know you identify with these kids, but not everyone is cut out for college. You've worked your ass off to defy expectations, but face it, you're a bit of an outlier. Yes, I've always felt like an outsider. Adopted, white parents, dad sick, mom drunk half the time, which might be worse than drunk all the time, 'cause at least I'd know which mother is walking through the door at night. I paid my own weight, Kate. And rugby made a big difference. Yeah, for you, but look what happened yesterday. Maybe encouraging them to play a brute sport where they slam into each other isn't the best for them. I mean don't they have enough to deal with over there? First of all, rugby is an outlet. Second of all, what do you mean by "over there"? When was the last time you set foot in North Philly? Fine. I'm just saying you're not their social worker, and you're definitely not their mother. I'm sorry, excuse me, what? OK, how many letters from your mom are gonna show up here before you respond to her? And you care, why? I care because you're my best friend, and maybe if you'd at least heard what she had to say you wouldn't be so damn guarded and shut off all the time. Here, what is this, number 100? Number mind your damn business. Bye. Maybe I should come back when you've done a little more yoga and you're less of a bitch. Your challenge is to figure out how to get from this to a perfect circle without letting go. This is going to be easy. - Ah, my arm. Ah, my arm! - Communicate! Teamwork! Spin! No, come on. Again. Let's go, man. - No. - What? No way are you coming into this class with that, and I don't even wanna know how you got it. - Slow, slow. - Have you ever been in the cafeteria, the food sucks. - What are y'all doing? - You put your hand-- - No. - In there. Are y'all holding hands? Get in there. We're never gonna get this. Failure is your teacher. If you're having trouble, ask for help. Lean into your team. That's what great teams do, they're family, they stick together. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. - Tuna. - My wrist, my wrist. - Too fast, man. - Guys, guys. One voice, one voice, go back, go back. All right. Next, you, Jonathon, go. Nice. Jaymie? Keep going, keep going, one more, one more. - Yes, victory! - OK, great! Practice is mandatory after school. It's a field trip. Hey yo, we should hold hands more often. Shut up, Tuna. Let's go. What are we doing here, Coach? You'll see. There's the man. How you doing? Good to see you, man. This is awesome, this is so great. - Happy to have you guys, man. - I'm so psyched. - KJ. - Mac. Guys, come here, come here. This is KJ, he's a good friend of mine. Head coach of USA 7s. Heard a lot of good things about you guys, welcome. Come on, I'll show you guys around. This is the big time, big time. All right. Here we are, are y'all ready? Ready. This is cool. - Dang. - Yo. Do you see this? Oh hell no, you want us to run with them? Relax, they're here to help. Fellas, these are the guys I was telling you about. - What's up, guys? - Hi. We got some practice gear in the back waiting for you guys. Suit up. All right, let's do this. - Hold it. - All right, ready? - Yeah. - Three, two, one. Stand back. Take, two, one. All right, guys, your turn. I wanna see guys run a special, OK? - All right, break. - All right. ¶ Bigger than you can hold, this is a bigger sword ¶ ¶ Be a fanatic, be a fanatic, be a fanatic ¶ ¶ So that you take control ¶ ¶ Push the bullet code ¶ ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶ Let's go. ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶ Go! ¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ Man, it's automatic, automatic ¶ I can do better. You like it, I love it. Go. ¶ Be a fanatic, be a fanatic, be a fanatic ¶ No, no, no, run that back, run that back. - You serious? - Go! ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶ All right, everybody, meet in the middle, hustle up. Nice work out there, and after only one month? Mm-hmm. I think you guys got something really special. You're not typical ruggers, you know that, right? But neither was I at your age. Look, Coach Nolin and I briefly started a rugby program at another high school called The Nomads. We had to shut things down because of budget cuts, but you guys got some real momentum. Listen, I grew up on these same streets. I know what this game can do for you and the opportunities it can bring. If you want something, and you're willing to work for it, anything is possible, all right? All right, bring it in. 7 as one. Team on three, team on three. - One, two, three. - Team! Let's call it, guys, huddle up. Great work. We want you all to know, we see you. We see you guys putting in the effort. And Coach Nolin and I think you're ready for your second scrimmage. We're playing Upper Darby, they're a really good team. The discipline you've been showing us these past few weeks, we'll see that effort when you're playing them, right? She means especially me. - We got you, Coach. - Yes, but it's more than that. You've worked hard, you're bonding like brothers and now it's time to put it into action. Coach, don't you think we need a team name? All right, any ideas? Well, we've been talking about it. We wanna pick up the team Coach Nolin and Coach KJ started. - The Nomads. - Mm-hmm. - I love it. - Nice. - All right. Take us out, Kahlil. - All right. Ayo, Nomads on three. - One, two, three. - Nomads! That's awesome. Whit, what? You OK? - Yeah, I'm good. - OK. Whit, what? Whitman. Whit, who? Whitman. Hey, guv. Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie. Where you been hidin' at, young bull? 'Sup, Ice, I've just been at school, you know. After all we've been through, you don't even call me when you get home? When I got out, we had a big party, mad chicks, everything and we supposed to have that for you. And now that's over with, it's too late for that. I'm full, man, I've just been busy-- Hold up, hold up, don't talk to me like that, bro. You been busy, that's disrespectful, you know that? I'm only messin' with you, kid. I wanna talk about how you gonna work off those four stacks you owe me though. - Four stacks? - Yeah. That bust wasn't my fault. I did a year, I coulda been out in two months, - but I kept my mouth shut. - Course you did. That's why it ain't four K plus interest. You know what happen to people that play with my paper, right? Look, I'll pay it off, I'll get a part time job-- How you gonna pay it off? Working in the poppy store? You gonna do some sweepin' and all that? That ain't gonna cut it. Look at me. You gonna pay me back my bread, that's a fact. Hold that. Welcome back to the team. You have a good evening, Jaymie. ¶ No turning back from your actions ¶ ¶ You are killin' it and showin' me ¶ ¶ Not to meet my savages ¶ What's goin' on, man, let's go. Watch the outside, Kahlil! I got it. Oh, what a hit! - Way to wrap him! - Let's go. - All right, line out. - What the hell are you doing? Get your damn head in the game, man. Line out, line out! Yeah, let's go. Whitman special, Whitman special. Yo, the Whitman special, Whitman special, let's go. We got less than a minute to play, guys. Three, two, one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, run it, run it, run it! Yes! - Nice! - Let's go! Come on! Hey come back, bring it back, bring it back. All right, we missed a kick, that's OK! Get back, get back, get back, yes! It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen. He dropped it! We did it, man! We got one! Great game, great game, good seeing you again. - Ah! - Yeah! Give us up, give us up, woo! All right, take a knee. How does it feel? You just won your first match and you did it together. You kept your cool. Total team effort, great job. - Great job! - Woo! Yes! OK, so we'll see you at practice tomorrow. No day off? Nope, especially since you need to be in top form for your upcoming tournament. What? I'm sorry, did we not tell you? We entered The Nomads into the Philadelphia High School Rugby Tournament. Oh hell ya, let's go. And we're slated to play, wait for it, our old buddies, St. Vincent's. Come on, it's a true shot at redemption. Show 'em how far we've come. Coach, we don't even have uniforms. I know, the uniforms and entry fees are on us. So, what do you say? Get your car wash today! One day discount special! Let's go! $5, come help a great cause! Come on, mom, come get your car wash. Hey, why don't you stop chattin' - and start working. - I know, right? Car wash! Good car! Get your car wash today! Get your car wash! Hey, man! Where'd this go? Hey, man! Make sure this ladder's steady, OK, make sure he doesn't go up too high. - What's going on here? - Anybody have a dustpan? We're just doing our part. Cleaning up a bit. Looks like you're building character too. How's the fundraiser going? It's going. You know, I'd like to give you a contribution. - Oh, wow, we really appreciate this. - Proud of you. This way is very good, man, this way. - Hey, keep up the good work. - Thank you. We need some music or sump'n, you hear that, you know what I mean? Would you like me to sing for you guys? - No. - No. ¶ Blood money over here ¶ ¶ Cash, fool, daily flip train, bling it down ¶ ¶ Flat call it the G language ¶ ¶ Keep flamin', sophisticated killers ¶ ¶ That's rich and famous ¶ Come on. ¶ Bakery, big stacks, get your cake snatched ¶ ¶ And your bra too, money can't replace that ¶ ¶ Run, but you can't hide ¶ ¶ The games that you're playin' get you killed ¶ ¶ By a coroner, coward, this is my corner ¶ 149, 150, 151. OK, we need another zero. We gotta think bigger, guys. All right, I know what everyone's thinking. I'll sell my body. I heard about this on the radio. A video contest, what do you love about Philly? $1,000 prize, the video with the most likes wins. What, you don't think I can get a stack for this right here? Man, you crazy. I like this video idea. That's thinking outside the box, Banner. And we know just the spot to shoot it too. Yo, what'd I tell y'all, look at this. Yeah, yeah, this is pretty dope. We gotta shoot where it's scenic. Look at that skyline. Now, that's some serious production value, man. OK, M. Night, just say action, I'll drop eight bars of fire. - Yeah, right. - Stupid, you know you can't spit, man, come on. Oh yeah, drop a beat, see what happens. Oh, are we serious? All right, OK. ¶ OK ¶ ¶ I'm the chubby Irish Drake, yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ Now put your hands up, like when your name is called ¶ ¶ Better part the seas when The Nomads get the ball ¶ ¶ Peep Tuna on the streets, watch the ladies' jaws fall ¶ ¶ Hit my jack, two, one, five ¶ ¶ 'Cause the rest of youse is soft ¶ ¶ Wait, what? ¶ Yo, you heard? Yo, he got bars. Man, peanut M&M in the building. Whoa, whoa. You did this. We're a team, remember? Thank you for that. Your dad is definitely smiling down on this right now. Right? - What's he doing? - I don't know. All right, you all worked hard and deserve to be celebrated, so today we're gonna hand out some awards. First, I'd like to thank my partner in crime and the one man who has more energy than all of us combined. Coach Nolin. - Thank you. - Nolin! So sweet. To the player who gave up his pads to play a real contact sport, he's demonstrated leadership and game smarts, Kahlil, come get this. - Yes. - Kahlil. To my tackling dummy. The player who has shown real courage and a newly-found restraint, Jaymie! Yeah. Chill, chill, relax, relax. Thanks, Coach. To the player who was willing to sell his body for the team-- And to the player who keeps us laughing. Tuna, we're proud of you. To the player who is most spiritually connected-- What do you got in there, man, a rock? John. - The hell, man? - Don't worry about it. I am worried about it. Do you wanna get locked up again? - You wouldn't understand. - Hey, you got your team now. You got me. OK. And last, but not least, to the player who can outrun school security and his opponents with the greatest sense of self, Banner. Yes. Whatever that means. All right, everybody let's eat. - Hey, don't use these plates. - Not with these plates. Yeah, come on, these are special. These are awards. - Put that down. - You can have two O'Brien. I never thought I could one eat. John Ethan, can you take this to my car please? Thank you. - Jaymie. - Yeah, Coach? I wanted to say something to you about how you handled things after St. Vincent's. The way you let things go. I'm really proud of you. - Thanks, Coach. - And... I want you to have this. My high school coach gave it to me because of some things I was dealing with back then. Believe it or not, I used to lose my cool too. I used to sleep with it, tucked in my arm for a year. You sure? Oh yeah, I know it's in good hands. What's up, Jaymie? See you, young bull. What's up, Deuce, Ice around? Nah, he left, what's good though? I need you to give him something for me. All right. What's all this? It's the four stacks plus an extra 500, and all the product there I left. Look, man, tell Ice, my bad, but I'm out. I can't do it no more. All right, I'll let him know what's going on. Don't worry, young bull, I got your back. I appreciate you. Listen. I know you're still upset 'cause of what I said about your mom, who by the way, sent yet another letter and also the insensitive white privilege rugby thing and that's OK. If this is an apology, it's your worst ever. Just hear me out. - I have news. - What? You're pregnant. Hardly, someone else got laid and she's pregnant. Specifically an English teacher at Immaculate Heart who wants to take a few years off. - OK. - Mac, there is a job for you at Immaculate Heart. Like 10 grand more than what you're making now. I mean it's not 100 % yet, but it's close. I talked you up big time, even while we were fighting, which I'm really proud of myself for. Well, I already slipped them your resume and they wanna meet you before they start their search. You may say something. Perhaps, thank you, my darling? Wow. Thank you. You get one, let me get one. Where's Coach? - I don't know. - Who cares. What's up with them? I'll be right back. Hold up, I'm coming with. - Nah, stay there. - No, I'm coming with. All right, but don't say shit. Hey yo, who dat? Yo. Let him handle it. Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie. What's up, Ice, they tell you? Yeah, they told me. They told me you came by the spot last night with half my product and no paper. What, I gave him 4,500 and everything I had. - I told you he'd say that. - Man, you lyin'. You callin' me a liar, young bull, I'll murk you, man. - You won't even touch him too. - Hey, man. So you wanna be hard, snowflake? Yeah. Hey boys, what's going on? He think he slick too. I'm not afraid of you. Oh, you ain't afraid of me. Have at him. - O'Brien, Jaymie. - You OK, man? Come on, come on, don't leave me, call 911, Nolin! Yeah. Stay with me, Jaymie, it's OK. - You know these guys? - It's gonna be OK, - Jaymie, Jaymie. - Yeah, hi. We're at 8th and Poplar, one of our students has been shot. Shh, oh my god, Jaymie, it's gonna be OK. Come on, Jaymie, Jaymie! Are you the family? Well, tonight we are. OK, well, Jaymie was shot twice. Once in the upper back, and once in the lower back. The second bullet just barely missed his spine. He's extremely lucky. Can we see him? I'm sorry, these are gunshot wounds. There are procedures. Jaymie's asleep right now and I really need him to stay that way. Trust me, he'll be here for awhile. Thank you, Doctor. OK, well, Tuna, we'll take you home. I can't. He's in good hands, he's a strong kid. Come on. I can't just leave him here. It's my fault. Mac? It's OK, it's OK. Come on, Jaymie, Jaymie. Oh my god, Jaymie, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, Jaymie. Stay awake, Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie! - Come on, guys. - What's all this about? Have a seat. Thanks for coming, guys, thank you. Hey, guys, Principal Wade wants to talk to you. Boys. I really hate to have to tell you, but the School Board is suspending rugby. - What? - What? That's not fair, this had nothin' to do with The Nomads. How about the school board lets us use a safer field? I wish it was that easy. But because of the circumstances, I'm afraid there's no other option. - This is bullshit. - Hey, come on. So, you're just gonna let them tear down everything we built? It was my job to keep you safe. I failed. We need this team. I'm stepping down at Whitman, I'll be leaving after midterms. Excuse me. Where you going? OK, boys, that's it for now. You all should head to the cafeteria. 'Cause that's a safe place, right? Come on, y'all. Sorry, guys. I know you're disappointed. OK, well they absolutely loved you, but now I feel terrible. Maybe I was wrong, those kids clearly need you. Don't turn on me now. It'll be great, we'll be together again drinking cappuccinos. Yeah. - Mac, listen-- - I gotta go. Be home soon. I'm good. Jeez, you clean up nice. You mind? Oh my god, that is good. You probably don't remember this, but... my third year of coaching with your dad, we had this kid Freddie. Incredible athlete, big heart, everybody just loved him, he had tons of potential, but he had this serious drug problem. We had this intervention, thankfully, he agreed to treatment. Cut to the chase, how long did it take you to get him cleaned up and get him back on the field? He OD'd the night before treatment. His mother found him in the basement. I'm sorry. I didn't even know if I could teach. But your father wouldn't let me quit. 'Cause there's always another kid coming along who needs our help, who we teach, who we coach, and if that's who we truly are then, that's what we do, right? We show up... we move forward. The kids' video won that contest. Check it out when you have a sec. We love our rugby team, the North Philly Nomads and why do we love it? Check this out. Right here, right here. The Nomads taught me that it's not about falling, it's about how quickly you get back up. Failure is your teacher. Where you going? If you can't get back up, you gotta ask for help. Lean on your team, your team's your family. And family sticks together. The arrogance is trying to prove yourself. But confidence comes from improving yourself. This is our land that rumbles. - This is our time. - This is our moment. - Whit, what? - Whitman. - Whit, who? - Whitman. - Whit, what? - Whitman. - Whit, who? - Whitman. - Whit, what? - Whitman. - Whit, who? - Whitman. - Whit, what? - Whitman. - What? - Whit who? Whitman! - Hey. - Hey. The video won. Of course, that jawn was tight. I heard Banner created like 100 profiles and voted on all of them. Ice, I don't want him to cause you no trouble-- He won't. The cops arrested all three of them and now ICE is a three-time loser who was out on parole. We won't be seeing him for a very long time. The first to raise his fist loses, right? Right. Jaymie, I'm so sorry. - I should've been there and-- - Coach. This isn't your fault, I got myself into this. See, I used isn't instead of ain't. Boy. How did you get to be so strong? I've been sharing Tuna's protein salads. Did your mom bring you that? Nah, O'Brien did. She came here the other day. I'll see her when I get home. Wait, your mom came once. She's a good mom, but she's using. She's not my mom, she's somebody else. Can't get mad at her when she's like that. Stuff makes her crazy, she's just doing the best she can, you know? Anyway, I know you don't like hearing this, but you've been more of a mom than she has lately. I don't mind hearing that at all. Sober. 18 months. Mom? Hi. I owe all of you an apology. I forgot something. That if I mess up or have a problem, I can lean on my team to help me back up. I always had trouble needing other people, ever since I was your age. I should've told you when we started that I can't be perfect. I won't be. I'm truly sorry. It's really hard for me to say this, but... I need you guys right now. I need your help. I need my team. Whatever it is, I'm in. Name it. We got your back, what's up? Any chance you all have collared shirts? The board grants Cassey McNamara the floor. Thank you. I'm a teacher at Whitman High School which absorbed two other schools after the closures. We also coach a rugby team called The Nomads, or we did. Our team was recently disbanded by this board after an unfortunate incident. They... We were victims and we're now being punished. Without understanding rugby it's hard to understand why it means so much to these boys. So I thought they should tell you themselves. This is life. Always moving forward, but with plenty of setbacks and that's OK because-- In rugby, we learn to fight through the pain. Life is better when you stick together. On and off the pitch, sometimes you gotta go backward to go forward. For us, the real world doesn't come with pads. You gotta brace yourself. Expect people to take cheap shots. You gotta watch yourselves, a'ight? Look. We know you're only trying to do what's best, but for us, this team is everything and we owe it to these coaches. They told us how to be proud of ourselves and our communities. It's not easy to survive where we come from. A place where graduating high school is a coin flip. The status quo around here isn't designed for hope. But because of them, for the first time in my life, I can see the possibilities. We're products of a system that doesn't provide a lot of resources, and yet we made the best of it. We need this team, and I hope you reconsider taking that away from us. Unfortunately, boys, we've already discussed this matter and decided. But I suppose this counts as new information. Anyone here opposed to a new vote? OK. All in favor of reversing the cancellation of the rugby program at Whitman High. Program reinstated, congratulations. OK, take it outside please. Thank you, thank you so much. You won't regret it. Yeah, go Nomads! Let's go, fellas! Let's go, come on now. Let's go, Nomads, huddle up. Bring it in. All right. I love you, guys. Look around you. We've come a long way together, right? You showed up, you're prepared, right? I'm so proud of you! Now get out there and respect yourselves and respect each other, you got it? - Got it. - Let's go! - Let's go! - Go Nomads! Nomads! - This is our time! - Our time. - This is our moment. - Our moment. This is our land. - Whit, what? - Whitman! - Whit, who? - Whitman. - One, two, three! - Nomads! ¶ Spoils ¶ ¶ Go ¶ ¶ Yeah ¶ ¶ Energy ¶ ¶ I need your energy, let's get this ¶ ¶ Energy, what you waitin' for ¶ ¶ Feed off your energy ¶ ¶ We need a jump ¶ ¶ Energy ¶ I'm a king! ¶ Energy, I can't hear you say ¶ ¶ I feed off your energy ¶ ¶ Energy, I feed off your energy ¶ ¶ Energy ¶ If you're here because you love football, I have great news. Rugby is the first version of football ever played. It's a game of passion, excitement, commitment, and beauty. Nomads, you will respect yourselves, respect each other and always do your best. You will earn your jersey. Look around, learn to lean on each other. You don't lose alone, and you can't win alone. So, what do you say? Yo, Coach, blow the whistle, let's play. ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶ ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶
