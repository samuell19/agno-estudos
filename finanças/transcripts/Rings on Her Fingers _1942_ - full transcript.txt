ALL DURING DINNER, I COULD FEEL THE HOT BREATH OF THE POLICE ON MY NECK. YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT AWAY. ALL RIGHT, IF WE CAN MAKE A ROPE LADDER OUT OF DENTAL FLOSS. OLD ADDLEPATE HAS HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT FOR MORE OF YOUR SPICY STORIES. HE'LL BE UP HERE ANY MINUTE TO DRAG YOU DOWNSTAIRS BODILY. THINK OF SOMETHING. ON AN EMPTY STOMACH? OH, FORGET YOUR STOMACH. LOOK, WHY DON'T I GET MR. WHEELER OUT OF THE WAY? HE'S LEAVING ON THE 10:00. WE ONLY HAVE TO KEEP THEM APART FOR AN HOUR. THAT'S IT! KEEP HIM BUSY UNTIL TRAIN TIME. THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. HOW WAS THAT PATE DE FOIS GRAS? OH... DOESN'T THE NIGHT AIR FEEL GOOD? WELL, HAVE YOU BEEN BUSY SINCE YOU CAME BACK TO TOWN? YES, I HAVE. I'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUR OLD FRIEND CAPTAIN BEASLEY. THEY HAVEN'T CAUGHT HIM YET? NO, BUT THEY WILL. I HAVE PRIVATE DETECTIVES WORKING ON IT. THAT'S GOOD NEWS. OH, LOOK. ISN'T IT SWEET? YES, AND A LITTLE SAD. A FAMILY RELIC. THIS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY NICE. IN GRANDMA'S DAY, WE COULD HAVE TAKEN A MOONLIGHT RIDE. WHY DON'T WE? LOOK, THE OLD CANDLE'S STILL THERE. WAIT. LET'S SEE IF IT'S STILL ALIVE. AH, THINGS WERE SIMPLE IN GRANDMA'S DAY. PEOPLE DIDN'T HURRY THROUGH LIFE. THEY TOOK TIME TO ENJOY IT. NOBODY TRIED TO OWN THE WHOLE WORLD. THEY FOUND PLEASURE IN THE LITTLE THINGS. EVEN THE SONGS WERE NICER. PUT ON YOUR OLD GRAY BONNET WITH THE BLUE RIBBONS ON IT AND WE'LL HITCH OLD DOBBIN TO THE SHAY THROUGH THE FIELDS OF CLOVER WE WILL RIDE TO DOVER ON OUR GOLDEN WEDDING DAY LOOK AT THE SONGS WOMEN INSPIRE TODAY. BEAT ME, DADDY, 8 TO THE BAR. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A QUESTION I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU. YES? WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF SOMEONE WHO PRETENDED TO BE SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T? WELL, IF THERE WAS A GOOD REASON FOR THE PRETENDING. THAT STILL MAKES THIS SOMEONE A PHONY, DOESN'T IT? I GUESS IT DOES, BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY CONDEMN ANYONE UNTIL YOU HEAR THEIR SIDE OF IT. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. AND YET, WHEN THE TIME COMES TO EXPLAIN, YOU CAN'T THINK OF EVEN A SINGLE EXCUSE. NO. "SORRY" IS SUCH A LITTLE WORD. WELL, LITTLE AS IT IS, I'M SAYING IT. WHAT? I'VE TRIED TO PUSH IN WHERE I DON'T BELONG. I'M NO MILLIONAIRE. I'M A $65-A-WEEK ACCOUNTANT. I OWN 2 SUITS, ONE WITH A HOLE IN THE SEAT, AND A WATCH THAT'S SLOW. THERE ARE 30 MILLION OTHER GUYS EXACTLY LIKE ME. WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? FORGIVE YOU? YOU'RE NOT MAD? NO, I--BUT... BUT THE YACHT AND EVERYTHING... OH, YOU'RE KIDDING. IT'S A GAG. $65 A WEEK, AND YOU WANTED TO BUY A YACHT. LOOK, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE. THIS IS MY LIFE, AND I'M NOT GONNA SPEND THE BEST YEARS OF IT IN A SWIVEL CHAIR. PEOPLE TAKE THEIR MONEY AND LOCK IT UP IN SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES AND DON'T USE IT. THEY DO THE SAME THING WITH THEIR LIVES. NOT ME. I'M TAKING TIME OUT TO LIVE. YOU HAVEN'T ANY MONEY, SO YOU'RE GOING TO RETIRE AND BUY A YACHT. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YES, IT DOES. I COULD BE LIKE THE OTHER FELLAS, FIGHTING THEIR WAY TO THE TOP AND I'LL PROBABLY HAVE A YACHT WHEN I'M 65, BUT THEN I'LL BE TOO OLD TO ENJOY IT. I WANT IT NOW. BUT WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY? WHERE DID THAT 15,000 COME FROM? YOU STOLE IT? YES...FROM MY SALARY. FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS, I'VE BANKED HALF OF EVERY CHECK AND ALL MY CHRISTMAS BONUSES. AND YOU LOST EVERY CENT? THANKS TO CAPTAIN BEASLEY. I HAD TO WIRE MY BOSS COLLECT FOR BUS FARE BACK. BUT ON $65 A WEEK. HOW CAN YOU SAVE THAT MUCH? IT CAN BE DONE. WHY, YOU DO YOUR OWN LAUNDRY, EAT IN ONE-ARM JOINTS, NO MOVIES, NO CLOTHES. I GUESS YOU WANTED TO GO SAILING PRETTY BADLY. OH, I'VE BEEN SAILING SHIPS EVER SINCE I WAS KNEE-HIGH TO A BOWSPRIT, BUT THEY ALWAYS BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE J.P. MORGAN JR. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU EVENTUALLY, AND SOMEHOW, I--I THOUGHT THAT HAVING THE BOAT WOULD SOLVE A LOT OF THINGS. I COULD HAVE MADE IT PAY, TOO. HAULING CARGO UP AND DOWN SOUTH AMERICA, I HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT. OH, WHAT'S THE USE OF JUSTIFYING IT? I WANTED YOU SO BADLY, I'D HAVE PRETENDED ANYTHING. WHAT AM I SAYING? I CAN'T COMPETE WITH FELLAS LIKE FENWICK. WHOEVER HEARD OF A MILK-WAGON HORSE WINNING THE DERBY? I HAVE... TONIGHT. YEAH. WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER. I KNOW, WE'RE CRAZY. I GUESS WE ARE. I FEEL WEAK ALL OVER. IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT WHEN YOU KISSED ME IN CALIFORNIA, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS SILLY TO FEEL THAT WAY OVER A PERFECT STRANGER. IT WAS SORT OF A SICKISH SENSATION? YES, IT WAS AWFUL. IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT WITH ME, EXACTLY. HOW DID YOUR STOMACH FEEL? HOLLOW. MINE, TOO. DOES IT FEEL HOLLOW NOW? EVEN HOLLOWER. THEN YOU MUST BE IN LOVE, TOO. IS THAT WHAT IT'S LIKE? THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE. THEN I GUESS I MUST BE IN LOVE. I GUESS SO. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DID A GOOD JOB KEEPING HIM BUSY. WHERE'D YOU GO, ANYWAY? OH, WELL, NEVER MIND. WHAT I'M DYING TO HEAR IS HOW YOU'VE GOTTEN ON WITH YOUNG FENWICK. OH, MAY, I'M SO HAPPY. HE PROPOSED. HE DID?! OH, DARLING! LET ME BE THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE YOU. THAT'S PROBABLY MOTHER AND DAD. COME IN. READY? HELLO, MRS. WORTHINGTON. I--I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE 10:00 TRAIN. WELL, MOTHER... I GUESS THIS IS A GOOD A TIME AS ANY. I'M NO MILLIONAIRE. I'M AN ACCOUNTANT. I MAKE $65 A WEEK. 65 A... I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE HER. I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER BUT MY LOVE, BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE HER HAPPY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE. WELL, THERE MUST-- THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. NO, THERE ISN'T. I TOLD YOU HE PROPOSED. HE? HIM? WILL YOU LEAVE HERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, YOU--YOU IMPOSTOR! I'LL BE PACKED IN JUST A MINUTE. YOU LUNATIC! WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT MEANS THAT I'M GOING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO OR SAY WILL STOP ME. HAVE YOU GONE OUT OF YOUR MIND? WHAT ABOUT TOD FENWICK? YOU CAN'T WALK OUT ON US JUST AS WE'RE ABOUT TO HIT THE JACKPOT. WE'RE ALL SET TO MAKE A COOL MILLION. STRANGELY ENOUGH, I'M NOT A BIT INTERESTED. I HAVE WHAT I WANT. LISTEN, PETER PAN, FACE FACTS. IF THAT SHORT HAIRCUT EVER FINDS OUT YOU GYPPED HIM, YOU'LL WIND UP IN JAIL OR BACK IN THE GIRDLE DEPARTMENT. A SUCKER NEVER FORGIVES OR FORGETS. I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES. NOW, BE A DEAR AND HELP ME PACK. WE'LL BE IN NEW YORK IN 45 MINUTES. THANK YOU. WHAT'S THAT? HOW TO SUPPORT A WIFE AND GET A YACHT ON $65 A WEEK. SAVINGS: $31, FOOD, $15, RENT, $15, MISCELLANEOUS, $4.00? THAT'S FOR CLOTHES, DOCTOR BILLS, AND ANY LITTLE EMERGENCIES THAT COME UP, AND IN 10 YEARS, WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO GET ANOTHER BOAT. OH, I LEFT OUT $10 EVERY WEEK FOR ACME. FOR WHO? THAT'S THE DETECTIVE AGENCY I HIRED TO CATCH THAT CROOK. THAT'S A NECESSARY EXPENSE. IF THEY'D ONLY TRAP THAT RAT WITH MY MONEY, WE'D HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YES, THAT WOULD BE DANDY. IT DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD NOW. EXPECTING A GIRL LIKE YOU TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND SCRIMP AND SAVE TO BUY A BOAT. IT WAS ALL RIGHT WHEN I WAS ALONE, BUT NOW, IT'S NOT THE SAME ANYMORE. BUT I WANT IT TO BE THE SAME. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING. BY RIGHTS, WE SHOULD BE SAVING TO BUY A HOUSE ON A HILL WITH GINGHAM CURTAINS AND KIDS RUNNIN' AROUND PLAYING COWBOYS AND INDIANS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST BEING IMPRACTICAL. ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? MAYBE YOUR MOTHER WAS RIGHT. YOU'RE GIVING UP ALL THE SWEET THINGS FOR THE BITTER: DODGING TAXIS INSTEAD OF RIDING IN THEM, DRINKING COFFEE OUT OF CHIPPED CUPS, HAVING YOUR SHOES RESOLED. IT'S A WORLD YOU NEVER KNEW. YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO SCARE ME, WOULD YOU? OH, IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT DIRTY SKUNK, WE'D HAVE EVERYTHING WE WANT TOMORROW. WE CAN, ANYWAY. I HAVE SOME MONEY OF MY OWN, JUST 15,000. I--I SAVED IT OUT OF MY ALLOWANCE. I WAS AFRAID YOU'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHY SHOULDN'T WE SHARE EVERYTHING? AFTER ALL, IT'S REALLY AS MUCH YOUR MONEY AS IT IS MINE. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT. IT'S THE ONLY WAY OUT. IT'S PROBABLY YOUR NIGHTCLUB SPENDING MONEY. YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A HEADWAITER. I'M NOT GONNA BE ONE OF SOCIETY'S KEPT MEN. NO, SIR, THERE'S SUCH A THING AS SELF-RESPECT. AND THERE'S SUCH A THING AS PIG-HEADED STUBBORNNESS. NOW, LISTEN, I WON'T TOUCH A CENT OF YOUR MONEY, WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE ON MY SALARY. YOU'VE GOT TO ANSWER YES OR NO. YES. I'M GONNA EAT WHAT YOU EAT AND LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE. AT MRS. CLANCY'S ROOMING HOUSE? IF THAT'S WHERE YOU LIVE, THAT'S WHERE I LIVE. I'M GOING TO DO ALL THE THINGS YOU DO. I WANT TO BE SO MUCH LIKE YOU THAT WE WON'T BE 2 PEOPLE, WE'LL BE ONE. AND ONE CAN LIVE CHEAPER THAN 2. I'M SURE GLAD YA GOT IT PATCHED UP, BUT WHY DON'T YA TAKE THE MONEY? WHO IS IT? A GENTLEMAN WHO'S GOING TO TAKE HIS INTENDED TO THE FINEST CHEAP RESTAURANT IN TOWN... IF SHE'LL PUT ON HER HAT AND NOT TAKE TOO LONG. WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE A HOME-COOKED MEAL, AS THE SAYING GOES? DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN COOK, TOO. YOU'RE REALLY COOKING DINNER? WITH MY OWN LITTLE HANDS. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE CHOPS MAY BE THE SAME WAY. SAY, I'VE REALLY GOT A TRIPLE-THREAT WOMAN, HAVEN'T I? CLASS, BEAUTY, NOW DOMESTICITY. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS. I COULDN'T VERY WELL GO AROUND WEARING A NEON SIGN ON MY BATHING SUIT. I COOK, TOO. I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T. I'D HAVE BEEN TRAMPLED IN THE RUSH. OH, HELLO, MR. KELLOGG. HELLO. COME ON IN HERE. OH, DINNER. DON'T LIKE TO INTERRUPT. AW. THIS IS MR. KELLOGG FROM ACME, MY DETECTIVE AGENCY. MISS WORTHINGTON. HOW YA? GOOD EVENING. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, MR. KELLOGG? WHAT'S THAT NAME AGAIN? WORTHINGTON. I ALWAYS LIKE TO GET NAMES STRAIGHT. YOU KNOW, NAMES ARE MY BUSINESS. WELL, MR. KELLOGG, WHAT LUCK? OH, A SLIPPERY BUNCH, A VERY SLIPPERY BUNCH. BUNCH? BEEN AT IT NIGHT AND DAY AND FOR WHAT WE'RE GETTIN', THIS CASE IS COSTIN' US 10 TIMES AS MUCH AS YOU'RE PAYIN'. YOU SAID "BUNCH." THERE WERE OTHERS? EXACTLY. YOU WERE VICTIMIZED BY NOT ONLY ONE MAN, BUT BY A WHOLE RING OF CROOKS. I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY BUT THIS CAPTAIN BEASLEY. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. A GANG OF THREE. WHERE ARE THEY? OH, KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON, MR. WHEELER. ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY. I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE, DID YOU? NO, BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN, FOR ALL WE KNOW. WAS SHE PRESENT, MISS WEATHERTON, HERE? WORTHINGTON. YES, SHE WAS. WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME THIS BEFORE. WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS CAN YOU CATCH 'EM, THESE PEOPLE? CAN WE? ACME NEVER SLEEPS. I HOPE WE GET 'EM BEFORE THEY SPEND ALL THE MONEY. OH, REST EASY. THIS TIME NEXT WEEK, YOU'LL BE SHAKIN' MY HAND DOWN AT THE POLICE STATION AND PAYIN' ME THAT REWARD. REWARD? I'M GIVING MR. KELLOGG 10% OF EVERYTHING HE RECOVERS. YEAH, AND WITH THAT DOUGH, I'M BUILDIN' ME A SUMMER HOME WHERE I CAN SHOOT DUCKS. THERE'S A THRILL FOR YA! BANG! BANG! PLOP IN THE WATER. DEAD DUCK. THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE. TALKIN' ABOUT MONEY WHILE I'M HERE, WE MIGHT AS WELL KEEP THE ACCOUNT UP TO DATE. YOU WOULDN'T RATHER WAIT TILL MONDAY? I ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP RIGHT UP TO SNUFF. DON'T WORRY, MISS FURTHINGTON, ANY MINUTE NOW, WE'LL BE SNAPPIN' THE BRACELETS ON 'EM. I CAN HARDLY WAIT. THANK YOU. WELL, I'LL BE CHECKIN' WITH YA. NICE KID. OH, HE MAY LOOK A LITTLE DUMB, BUT HE'S FROM THE BEST AGENCY IN TOWN. IF ANYBODY CAN CATCH THEM, KELLOGG CAN. DARLING, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'LL BE FRYING EGGS IN OUR OWN GALLEY, AND IT CAN'T BE ANY TOO SOON FOR ME. YES, IT CAN'T BE ANY-- THE CHOPS! I'M SORRY. WHAT'S ONE DINNER WHEN YOU'LL BE COOKING FOR ME FOR THE NEXT 200 YEARS? MY INVITATION STILL STANDS. GET YOUR UMBRELLA AND HAT, AND I'LL CHANGE MY TIE. OH, DARLING, BEFORE I FORGET, WILL YOU DO AN ERRAND FOR ME TOMORROW? TO THE MOON AND BACK. I'VE GOT SOME MONEY I'D LIKE YOU TO DEPOSIT FOR ME. SURE. WHAT BANK? WELL, I CLOSED MY OLD ACCOUNT. THERE'S NO SENSE IN OPENING A NEW ONE UNDER MISS WORTHINGTON WHEN I'M GOING TO BE MRS. WHEELER SO SOON. SO? SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST DEPOSIT IT IN YOURS FOR NOW. MAKE IT SORT OF A JOINT ACCOUNT. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE... WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER! DON'T PULL THAT INNOCENT STUFF! THERE YA GO, PLOTTING AGAIN. JOHN, I ONLY-- THAT'S A NICE TRICK. TRYING TO SNEAK YOUR SOCIETY MONEY TO ME RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE WHILE MY BACK IS TURNED. I MERELY WANTED TO-- WE'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH THIS! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU MENTION MONEY AGAIN! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, IT'S NOTHING TO GET UPSET ABOUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, ANYWAY? THERE, THERE, NOW-- I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR: I WOULDN'T LET YOU BUY ME A TRIP ON THE SUBWAY. ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN RUN ALONG BEHIND. AM I FORGIVEN? NO, NOT YET. I WANT TO SULK FOR A WHILE. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A FACE LIKE THAT, OUR QUARRELS WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER. WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO FIGHT AFTER WE'RE MARRIED. RIGHT NOW, LET'S GO OUT AND CELEBRATE OUR ENGAGEMENT. ALL RIGHT. GO WASH YOUR FACE. GO WASH YOUR FACE. HELLO? PUT HER ON. HELLO, LINDA. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME? OH, COLONEL, I'M IN A TERRIBLE HURRY. I NEED A FAVOR. WILL YOU? OH, YOU'RE AWFULLY SWEET. IT'S THIS: I HAVE $15,000 I WANT YOU TO GIVE TO SOMEBODY. OH, I'M SORRY, MY DEAR, THIS MUST BE A BAD CONNECTION. FOR A MOMENT, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GIVE SOMEBODY $15,000. I SEE. DO YOU FEEL WELL? OH, OF COURSE I PROMISE. BUT I MUST SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY LINE. YOU'RE A DARLING. HIS NAME IS WHEELER, AND HE'S GOT TO GET IT BACK SO HE THINKS HE'S WINNING IT, YOU KNOW, A LUCKY STREAK? OH, THIS IS A NEW YORK FAIRY TALE. WE'LL MAKE HISTORY-- GIVING MONEY AWAY. ALL RIGHT, SEND IT ROUND BY MESSENGER. NOW, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START? WELL, LET ME SEE. IT'LL HAVE TO BE DONE IN EASY STAGES. HE'S A LITTLE CONSERVATIVE. BETTER START AT NICK'S. HEY, BUDDY! YOU'RE IN LOW GEAR! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THIS IS NO PLACE TO CELEBRATE OUR ENGAGEMENT. IT'S THE CHEAPEST. BUT NOT VERY ROMANTIC. IF I ASKED FOR A WALTZ, THEY'D KNIFE ME! HOW ABOUT SOME ROOT BEER? IT WOULD BE JUST MY LUCK TO MARRY A WOMAN WHO DRINKS. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE. ARE YOU NICK? I'M CHICK. NICK IS SICK. DID THE COLONEL PHONE? OH, HELLO. YEAH, EVERYTHING IS FIXED. YA SURE YOU WANT HIM TO WIN? MAYBE I AIN'T HOID RIGHT. YOU "HOID" RIGHT. YOU MUST BE CRAZY, HUH? THAT WOULD BE TELLIN'. THERE HE IS WITH THE ROOT BEER. YOU CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T TRY. YOU DID VERY WELL. NOBODY EVER MAKES IT. YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF MINE. A PRIZE. A RING! NOW IT'S OFFICIAL. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH, BUT I WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS NICE. TIFFANY'S. IT'S JUST WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED. THE STONES AREN'T AS BIG AS I'D HAVE LIKED, BUT THE SETTING'S PRETTY. OH, I FEEL SO LUCKY. SAY, LET'S PUT A NICKEL IN ONE OF THOSE THINGS. NO. COME ON. NO, WE CAN ONLY SAVE OUR QUOTA BARRING ACCIDENTS, AND GAMBLING IS ONE OF THOSE ACCIDENTS. AW, ONE NICKEL. TONIGHT'S OUR LUCKY NIGHT. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LUCK. THESE THINGS ARE A SIMPLE MATTER OF MATHEMATICS, UNLESS THEY'RE FIXED, IN WHICH CASE, THEY NEVER PAY OFF. BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LUCK. DARLING, IF THERE'S ONE THING I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND, IT'S NUMBERS. JUST APPLY THE LAW OF PROBABILITIES. WHY, THERE'S ONLY ONE CHANCE IN 500,000 THAT A SLOT MACHINE WILL PAY OFF. WHY WASTE THE NICKEL? BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A LAW PASSED AGAINST LUCK. WHY, EVEN MR. EINSTEIN MIGHT PUT A NICKEL IN AND HIT THE JACKPOT. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A HALF A MILLION TIMES. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOW YA. YA SEE? I TOLD YOU TONIGHT WAS OUR LUCKY NIGHT. WELL, THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING. IT'S JUST DUE TO COME UP, THAT'S ALL. IT PROVES YOU'RE LUCKY. THAT'S SILLY. LUCK. HERE'S YOUR ANSWER. GIVE IN, MR. WHEELER. WE'RE A LUCKY COMBINATION. SAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IT'S A MATHEMATICAL COINCIDENCE. IT CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. HOW MANY MACHINES DO YOU HAVE HERE? 35. THE ODDS ARE 27 MILLION TO 3 THAT I WON'T HIT ANOTHER JACKPOT. WE GOT A PROFESSOR HERE TONIGHT. A BIG GENIUS. SCIENCE LEAVES NO ROOM FOR LUCK. IT GOT IN SOMEHOW. THIS IS FANTASTIC! THEY'RE OUT OF ORDER! IT'S A MECHANICAL FLUKE! THEY'VE GONE HAYWIRE! I'LL PROVE THAT THIS IS MATHEMATICS IF IT'S THE LAST THING I EVER DO. LUCK IS THE MOST STUPID-- NOBODY WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE... BOY, IS HE... 7 THE WINNER. COMING OUT. 7, THE WINNER! DADDY! 4 IN A ROW! I'M IN ON THIS. LET IT RIDE? YOU SAID IT! 7, THE WINNER! COME ON, LUCKY! I'M NOT. I TELL YOU, IT'S JUST FREAKISH. I CAN'T POSSIBLY THROW ANOTHER 7. 11, THE WINNER! LET IT RIDE! 8 IN A ROW! WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT, MR. WHEELER?! I DON'T CALL IT LUCK. THERE ARE ONLY 12 SIDES TO DICE. THAT'S ONLY 530 DIFFERENT POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS. JUST BECAUSE THE SAME COMBINATION COMES UP SEVERAL TIMES, IT DOESN'T MEAN-- ALL RIGHT, BUT IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE... 7, THE WINNER! THOSE DICE ARE CROOKED! NOW LET'S PLAY ROULETTE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS ARE ON ROULETTE? SILLY, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. AW, COME ON, JUST ONCE. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. THERE, NOW, 15's A GOOD NUMBER. DARLING, DON'T DO THAT. 18, RED, EVEN. WE WIN! NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME, DARLING? PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. 23, RED. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. 6, EVEN, BLACK. I WIN. YOU SEE? I JUST CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. WELL, MAYBE I CAN. MAYBE I CAN. IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GAVE DAME FORTUNE A LITTLE CREDIT. 2 ODD IN A ROW, 3 EVEN. IT'S DE MORGAN'S THEORY. IN ANY NUMERICAL SERIES, THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH ANY GIVEN NUMBER APPEARS IS IN DIRECT RATIO TO THE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES AND THE FREQUENCY OF RESULTS. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. I TOLD YOU IT WAS MATHEMATICS. WHATEVER IT IS, KEEP GOING. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. DARLING, I THINK I'M WORKING ON A GREAT FORMULA. I WANT TO TRY IT ON THE NUMBERS. ENJOYING YOURSELF, SIR? OH, DARLING, I WANT YOU TO KNOW COLONEL PRENTISS. HE'S THE BOSS HERE. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? HOW DO YOU DO? I CONGRATULATE YOU ON RUNNING AN HONEST GAME, OTHERWISE, MATHEMATICAL LAW WOULDN'T WORK. THANK YOU, SIR. I'M GIVING YOU FAIR WARNING. I'M GONNA BREAK THE PLACE. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE TIP. WHAT WERE THE LAST WINNING NUMBERS? 17, 11, 5, SIR. I'LL NEED SOME PAPER. I'LL GET IT. YOU KEEP PLAYING. AND A PENCIL. 12. OH, BILL, TAKE THAT PAD AND PENCIL TO THAT GENTLEMAN IN THE GRAY SUIT. YES, SIR. 2 SPECIALS, JACK. YES, SIR. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. NUMBER 15. HE'S AWFULLY CUTE, ISN'T HE, SCRIBBLING DOWN ALL THOSE NUMBERS? JUST LIKE A SCHOOLBOY. I GATHER YOU RATHER LIKE HIM. I RATHER DO. 19. AMUSING LAD, THAT. HAS A SYSTEM, EH? NUMBER 19. 19! IT'S 19! MY NUMBER! I KNEW IT WOULD BE. I SAY, WARREN DOESN'T OBJECT TO THIS WIPING THE SLATE CLEAN BUSINESS, DOES HE? I HOPE NO PART OF THIS 15,000 IS HIS. OH, NO. THIS WAS A PRIVATE MATTER. OH, THANK YOU. I WANT TO TAKE THIS TO HIM. 8 WINS. EVEN. HERE. I DID IT AGAIN. I GOT IT LICKED. THAT'S MIRACULOUS. I JUST ALLOWED FOR THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ERRORS. I BELIEVE YOU, DARLING. COULD I CASH THESE IN, PLEASE? AW, NOT YET. I BEAT ROULETTE, AND I CAN GO ON BEATING IT. KEEP GOING. MAYBE YOU CAN WIN OUR BOAT. AND 6 MONTHS' PROVISIONS. CASH THESE IN AT THE WINDOW. SEEMS A SHAME TO QUIT NOW WHEN YOU HAVEN'T FAR TO GO. I FEEL DIZZY. I CAN'T THINK ANYMORE. WELL, A NICE BIT OF LUCK. I MUST BE A LITTLE DIZZY. I HAVEN'T DONE SO MUCH FIGURING SINCE I SET UP THE FENWICK TRUST FUND. ROULETTE TAKES SUCH INTENSE CONCENTRATION. YOU GOTTA CONSIDER EACH OF 37 DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES. YES, DEAR. THAT'S GOOD LEMONADE, ISN'T IT? MOSTLY RUM, DEAR. THERE YOU ARE. $14,103. YOU'RE ONLY 900 AWAY FROM YOUR BOAT. COME ON, LET'S TRY ONCE MORE. RIGHT NOW, I COULDN'T ADD UP 2 AND 2. LET'S GO HOME. ISN'T IT WONDERFUL WINNING ALL THIS MONEY? WONDERFUL? IT'S JUST THE OLD SCIENTIFIC MIND AT WORK. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. "WHEELER, MY BOY, YOU HAVE MATHEMATICAL SAGACITY." YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? PATRICK HENRY. NO. IT WAS MY PROFESSOR. YOU KNOW WHO THE TOP MAN IN THE CLASS WAS? THE PROFESSOR. NO, ME. I GUESS I PROVED IT'S NOT LUCK, DIDN'T I? JUST THE OLD SAGACITY. I DON'T BET WILLY-NILLY. YES, DEAR. YOU CAN'T LOSE. THEY'RE AT MY MERCY. YES, DEAR. I COULD WORK OUT A SYSTEM AT ANYTHING. IT'S A CINCH. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY OLD FISH BARGE. NO, DEAR. WE'LL HAVE A 2O0-FOOTER WITH TWIN DIESEL MOTORS CHUGGING BACK AND FORTH. CHUG-CHUG. THANK YOU, SIR. COME ON, DARLING. IT'S WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME. DON'T MENTION IT. MORNING. GOOD NIGHT, DARLING. COME IN FOR JUST A MINUTE. AW, IT'S TOO LATE. I'LL TALK LOUD AND WAKE EVERYBODY UP. ALL RIGHT. JUST FOR ONE MINUTE. GOOD NIGHT, DARLING. YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP. SLEEP. SLEEP. HELLO, PRIEST-WHITEHALL, INCORPORATED? CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS AND INVESTMENT BROKERS? WELL, THIS IS JOHN WHEELER. YEAH, WAGE-SLAVE NUMBER 65. I WON'T BE IN THIS MORNING. I WON'T EVER BE IN. I'M QUITTING, AND YOU'RE ALL FIRED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I HAVE GREAT NEWS FOR YOU. TOD FENWICK PROPOSED BY WIRE, AND WE ACCEPTED IN YOUR NAME. THE WEDDING WILL BE NEXT SUNDAY. WELL, I HOPE THE THREE OF YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY. I WILL, BECAUSE I WON'T BE THERE. OH, LINDA, DARLING, BE SENSIBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO WARREN. WHY, TOD FENWICK IS HIS BIGGEST CATCH. IF YOU DON'T PLAY BALL WITH WARREN, THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT HE'LL DO. MAY, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH WARREN. ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE STUBBORN ABOUT IT. REMEMBER I WARNED YOU. GOOD LUCK TO YOU, BABY, ANYWAY. THANKS, MAY. OH, HELLO, MR. KELLOGG. YOUR MOTHER IS A CHARMING LADY, ISN'T SHE? THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GENERAL OPINION. HOME FROM WORK YET? OH, NO. NO, HE ISN'T HOME FROM WORK YET. SOMETHING IMPORTANT? WELL, I WANTED TO GET HIM TO SIGN A WARRANT FOR SOMEBODY'S ARREST, MISS WORTHINGTON. I BETTER HAVE A LOOK-SEE. I TELL YOU, I JUST LOOKED IN A MINUTE AGO. UH, HE NEVER GETS HOME TILL ABOUT 5:30. IT'S ONLY 4:15 NOW. WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK IN AN HOUR? I'LL WAIT. WON'T YOU COME IN HERE AND WAIT? YEAH. YEAH. PLEASE SIT DOWN. GOING SOMEWHERE? OH, JUST MOVING TO ANOTHER FLAT. WELL, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? EH, DIDN'T SLEEP A WINK ALL NIGHT. BEEN TRAILING PEOPLE. AW, THAT'S TOO BAD. CAN I GET YOU SOME HOT MILK? NO, THAT WOULD ONLY MAKE ME DOPEY. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A NICE KID, BUT IN MY BUSINESS YOU CAN'T BE SENTIMENTAL AND GO DUCK HUNTING, TOO. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. FOLLOW THAT TAXI. GOOD AFTERNOON, MISS WORTHINGTON. WHERE MIGHT YOU BE TIPTOEING TO? We're leaving, Mrs. Clancy. YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE WHOLE WEEK. Yes. This will take care of us both. THANKS. YOU DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF MY NICE DISHES, DID YOU? That's not very funny. WHAT ARE YOU WHISPERING ABOUT? I've got asthma. Oh, no, don't go in there. WHY NOT? It's still my room. I've paid for the whole week. I still want to use it. LEAVE YOUR FORWARDING ADDRESS DOWNSTAIRS. HELLO, HONEY. 31. I DID IT AGAIN! DARLING, I JUST WON $225,000 IN THE LAST HALF HOUR. JOHN, I THINK-- IMAGINE WHAT WE'LL DO TO THE CHUKKA TONIGHT. I'LL OWN THE PLACE BY MORNING. THE CHUKKA WILL BE A LITTLE UNWIELDY TO SAIL TO SOUTH AMERICA. COME ON, DARLING, YOU HAVE TO GET READY. WHAT'S THE HURRY? HEY, I KNOW A BARKENTINE WITH AN ALL-STEEL HULL I CAN GET FOR 120,000. DARLING, WE'RE TAKING THE PLANE TO CALIFORNIA TONIGHT. WHAT?! WE PLANNED IT ALL LAST NIGHT. WE DID? I DON'T REMEMBER, SWEETHEART. DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT LAST NIGHT? JUST THAT I WAS THE HAPPIEST GUY IN THE WHOLE WORLD. LAST NIGHT AND RIGHT NOW. GOOD MORNING, MRS. WHEELER. SAY, THAT'S GONNA SOUND GOOD. LINDA AND JOHN WHEELER. I LIKE THAT. THEY'RE REAL OLD-FASHIONED NAMES. SOUND LIKE A COUPLE OF PILGRIMS. DO WE HAVE TO GO TONIGHT? YOU PROMISED. I'M ALL PACKED. WHAT'S THE HURRY? YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE, HONEY, WHAT I'VE GOT. I'M GRATEFUL FOR WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, BABY. EVERY MAN HAS HIS MOMENT. WELL, THIS IS MINE. I'VE CERTAINLY WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR IT. NOW'S NO TIME TO WALK OUT. WHY NOT? WE'VE GOT ALL WE WANT. WELL, WAIT A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I'LL BUY YOU THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PUT SAILS ON IT. LOOK, DARLING, SYSTEMS HAVE A WAY OF ACTING LIKE FOLDING BEDS. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT. IT'S RAINING $5.00 GOLD PIECES, AND YOU WON'T LET ME STOP AND PICK THEM UP. LOOK, YOU DON'T REALIZE THERE MUST BE 50 OTHER PLACES LIKE THE CHUKKA. I'LL KNOCK THEM OVER ONE BY ONE. DON'T WORRY. I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA. WE'LL GO-- BUT WE'LL TAKE HALF OF NEW YORK ON THE PLANE WITH US. JOHN, WE'RE LEAVING NOW. YOU KNOW, THAT'S FUNNY. THAT SOUNDED LIKE A COMMAND. IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SOUND LIKE YOU. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SOUND LIKE YOURSELF EITHER. MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP. WELL, NOW, LOOK, LINDA. I'M LOOKING AND I CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY. HALF OF NEW YORK, RHODE ISLAND. WHY, YOU SOUND LIKE A REAL ESTATE AGENT. WHAT BECAME OF ALL THOSE ROSY DREAMS ABOUT BLUE LAGOONS AND GOLDEN SUNSETS? NOW THAT YOU CAN HAVE THEM, WHY, YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME IN SOMEBODY'S BACK ROOM PLAYING ROULETTE WITH A LOT OF CHISELERS. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT? I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND. I'D LIKE TO KNOW SO I CAN MAKE UP MINE. I'VE MADE IT UP. WHERE DO WE GO FIRST? OH, WELL... FIRST WE EAT... THEN WE'LL GO DO SOME LAST-MINUTE SHOPPING. NO, THAT'S NOT MINE. THEN GO BUY THE TICKETS. HAVE I GOT EVERYTHING? SURE. YOU KNOW, THE LAW OF PROBABILITIES HAS BEEN AWFULLY GOOD TO ME. OUT OF 130 MILLION PEOPLE THAT YOU SHOULD WIND UP ON MY DOORSTEP. I HOPE YOU'LL ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY. OH, I GOT TO PAY MRS. CLANCY. MRS. CLANCY! I've already paid her. YOU DID? What's the matter? Mrs. Clancy's having a baby. What? She's a widow. Well, live and let live. I DON'T SEE WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE A LATER PLANE. YOU ACT AS THOUGH IT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. OH, IT'S JUST THAT I WANT TO BE ON OUR WAY. WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET TICKETS THE LAST MINUTE. OH, WE SHOULD. WHY, THERE ARE 4 PLANES A DAY. OH, WHILE YOU'RE WAITING, I'LL GO GET SOME THINGS AT THE DRUGSTORE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ANYTHING YOU WANT? YEAH, SHAVING CREAM AND A KISS. IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY? THEY'LL JUST THINK WE'RE SAYING GOOD-BYE. PAPER, MISTER? PAPER! PAPER! PAPER, MISTER? PAPER! LINDA! DARLING! PAPER, MISTER? PAPER? I'M SO HAPPY. I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY EITHER. I JUST TALKED TO MOTHER FROM CHICAGO. IT SEEMS THAT SUNDAY'S A LITTLE SOON FOR EVERYBODY, BUT NOT FOR ME. COME ON OVER HERE, TOD. I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. WHAT, DARLING? OH, I MUST EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU, TOD. LOOK, DEAR, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR? OH, I FORGOT TO PHONE MOTHER. YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL PHONE HER LATER. OH, NO, NO, I MUST RIGHT NOW. WELL! HEY, IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT, USE THE DOOR MARKED EXIT. I--I--YOU! QUICK, DRIVE TO JERSEY CITY, BUT I WON'T BE WITH YOU. HEY, WHAT KIND OF A GAG IS THIS? HERE'S $20. DON'T LET ANYBODY CATCH YOU! FOR $20 NOT EVEN MY WIFE'LL CATCH ME, AND YOU DON'T KNOW MY WIFE. SEE THAT SECOND CAB? DON'T LET IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT. JOHN, HELLO THERE. TOD, HOW'D EVERYTHING GO IN CHICAGO? OH, FINE. WE'RE STARTING ANOTHER FACTORY. THAT'S GOOD. I'VE GOT BETTER NEWS THAN THAT, THOUGH. I'M GONNA BE MARRIED SUNDAY. WHAT?! YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS, TOD. THAT'S REALLY WONDERFUL NEWS. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED ALL ALONG. OH, THAT'S WHAT EVERY MAN NEEDS. SAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE RETIRING AGAIN. I'M GETTING MARRIED, TOO. NO. YEAH. WELL, OLD DAN CUPID GOT US BOTH AT THE SAME TIME, HUH? LOOKS LIKE IT. LOTS OF HAPPINESS, FELLA. SAME TO YOU. SAY, MAYBE WE CAN ALL GET TOGETHER SOON. SURE. WE WON'T BE BACK FOR QUITE A WHILE. WHEN I DO I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU. DO THAT. THE GIRLS MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. SAY, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU KNOW THIS GIRL. DO I? WHICH ONE? I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT YOU'RE HOLDING UP THE LINE. YOU BETTER GET YOUR TICKETS. SO LONG. HAPPY HONEYMOON. YEAH. YES, SIR? I'M SORRY. I WANT 2 ON THE 7:00 TO CALIFORNIA. THE 7:00's ALL FILLED UP. I CAN GIVE YOU 2 ON THE 10:00. ALL RIGHT. GET THE TICKETS? YEAH, I GOT 2 ON THE 10:00. THEY WERE ALL BOOKED UP ON THE 7:00. IT'S THE BEST WE COULD DO, DARLING. I JUST SAW TOD FENWICK. YOU DID? HE'S GETTING MARRIED, TOO. WHAT DID HE SAY? I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TELL HIM ABOUT YOU. COME ON, LET'S FIND HIM. HE'LL BE SURPRISED. OH, WE'LL SEE HIM WHEN WE COME BACK. WELL, ALL RIGHT. OK, COME ON. I'LL BUY YOU A NICE LITTLE SUPPER AT THE CHUKKA AND THEN AN HOUR OR TWO OF THE WHEELER SYSTEM. WE'LL FLY TO CALIFORNIA ON A RAINBOW. OH, I JUST REMEMBERED A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THING. I FORGOT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MOTHER. I'VE GOT TO DO THAT. OH, YES, WE SHOULD. LET'S GO. OH, NO, NO. DOES SHE STILL FEEL THE SAME ABOUT ME? OH, NO, DARLING, IT ISN'T THAT. YES, IT IS THAT. NOW I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T CATCH THE 7:00. HONEY, I'LL MEET YOU AT THAT GATE AT 9:45. OH, I'M AFRAID TO LET YOU GO. WHY? SHE'LL TRY TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT. I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT. DON'T WORRY, JOHN. I'LL BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S A SECRET, BUT I'LL TELL YOU. IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. WILL YOU REMEMBER THAT? I'LL TRY. YOU TAKE CARE OF THE LUGGAGE. TOD. OH, HERE YOU ARE. COME ON, THIS WAY. SAY, WHAT IS THIS THING YOU WANT TO TELL ME? WELL, TOD, YOU SEE, IT'S ABOUT-- OH, TOD! LINDA! HELLO, DARLING! TOD, DARLING! OH, THE TRAFFIC WAS TERRIBLE. WE JUST GOT HERE. WELL, I SEE YOU GOT HERE FIRST, LINDA. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS? OH, NOW, THEODORE. NEVER HAVING BEEN A BRIDE YOURSELF, YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH THERE IS TO DO. I HOPE YOUR HEADACHE'S BETTER, LINDA. YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LINDA. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU HERE. BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR HEAD CLEARED UP. DON'T BE. IT HASN'T. WHAT'S THAT, PET? I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA OF GOING THROUGH WITH THIS THING. WELL, LET'S GO. I RESERVED A TABLE AT THE TAVERN. OH, HURRY UP, UNCLE. NO, NO. YOU FOLKS RUN ALONG. I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. PLEASE JOIN US. CAN'T IT WAIT? OH, NO. I'M AFRAID IT CAN'T WAIT. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF MUCH TOO LONG. I'LL JOIN YOU LATER. GOOD-BYE. GOOD NIGHT. THEY'RE TOGETHER. STAY WITH THAT CAB. IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU, DEAR? OH, IT'S MY HEADACHE AGAIN. I MAY HAVE TO BE EXCUSED, TOD. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, YOU'RE GONNA SEE HISTORY MADE IN THE NEXT 2 HOURS. 17. THE BOY HAS $900 MORE COMING TO HIM. WHEN HE WINS THAT, STALL HIM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, STALL HIM? OH, LET HIM WIN 500, LET HIM LOSE 2. LET HIM WIN 3. YOU KNOW. THERE'S A GUY IN THE OFFICE WANTS TO SEE YA, HARRY. OH, THANK YOU. 11 IS THE WINNER, ODD. WELL, WELL, THE OLD WALRUS HIMSELF. WITH A PAIN IN BOTH TUSKS, THANKS TO YOU. I WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THIS LITTLE CONSPIRACY AGAINST ME. CONSPIRACY? OH, YOU MEAN LINDA AND THE BOY. SHE TOLD ME THAT WAS ENTIRELY HER AFFAIR. GIVING AWAY $15,000 OF MY HARD-EARNED MONEY?! BUT LINDA ASSURED ME YOU HAD NO PART IN THIS TRANSACTION, OLD BOY. MUST YOU BELIEVE THE EVERY SYLLABLE OF A LOVESICK SHOP GIRL? I CAN SEE WHY YOU WERE CASHIERED FROM THE ARMY. NOW, LET'S KEEP PERSONALITIES OUT OF THIS. AND WHATEVER THE SITUATION, I'M IN HEARTY AGREEMENT WITH WHAT SHE'S DOING. WELL, WELL, WHAT HAVE WE HERE? A SENTIMENTALIST, PERHAPS. SHE'S A GRAND GIRL. GIVE HER A BREAK. I CAN'T AFFORD TO. AND WHAT'S MORE, NEITHER CAN YOU. YOU UPSET MY APPLECART, AND I'LL UPSET YOURS. I WANT MY 15,000 BACK. WELL? SOMEHOW, WARREN, YOU ALWAYS BRING OUT THE HEEL IN ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY. PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE SO MANY OF YOUR BODIES ARE BURIED. BE SURE THAT HE'S THOROUGHLY DRY-CLEANED. YES. GIVE THAT TO JACK. IT GIVES ME A COLD CHILL TO THINK WHAT THAT WILL DO TO HER. NUMBER 8 WINS. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO AGAIN. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ALL BETS DOWN. NUMBER 9, ODD. WHAT?! IT WAS NUMBER 9, SIR. YOU WERE ON NUMBER 7. WAS I? THAT'S FUNNY. THAT'S THE THIRD TIME IT'S HAPPENED, TOO. JUST 2 NUMBERS OFF. WHAT'S THE MATTER? DID YOU SLIP UP SOMEWHERE? OH, SURE. I'VE BEEN PUTTING "X" IN THE WRONG PLACE. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. WELL, I'M GONNA FOLLOW MY OWN HUNCH. THAT'S IT. WELL, HERE'S WHERE I WIN IT ALL BACK. 17. HOLD YOUR BETS, PLEASE. 15 WINS. BUT IT CAN'T BE. IT CAN'T BE. NUMBER 11 WINS. I THOUGHT SO! YOU DOUBLE-CROSSER! I'M SORRY, LINDA. AND YOU! YOU! YOU KNOW, MY DEAR, IT'S BECOMING VERY OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE A 10-CENT BABY IN A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS. I SHOULD'VE EXPECTED THIS! YOU'RE ALL STOMACH! THERE ISN'T ANY ROOM FOR A HEART. NO NEED FOR IMPERTINENCE. IT'S REALLY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. NUMBER 3. STOP IT! STOP IT! YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE THE ONLY HUMAN BEING IN THIS ROOM. IT'S HIS LIFE YOU'RE ROBBING HIM OF--11 YEARS OF IT-- 11 YEARS OF GOING WITHOUT EVERYTHING, SAVING PENNIES, GOING WITHOUT LIVING. GIVE IT BACK TO HIM. HE NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO HIM? MIGHT I ASK HOW YOU CAN DO THIS TO ME? WALKING OUT WHEN, BY JUST LENDING YOUR MERE PRESENCE, I COULD HAVE ALL THE THINGS I'VE ALWAYS WANTED. OH, WARREN, YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY ELSE. WHEN LILLIAN LEFT, YOU GOT ME. BARGAIN BASEMENTS ARE FILLED WITH LINDA WORTHINGTONS. UNFORTUNATELY, DARLING, TOD FENWICK'S IN LOVE WITH YOU, NOT SOMEBODY ELSE. OH, WARREN, YOU CAN BE SUCH A NICE GUY WHEN YOU WANT TO BE. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. YOU'RE JUST SORE. GIVE IT BACK TO HIM. YOU DON'T NEED IT. YOU'RE AFTER BIG MONEY. WHY, 15,000 TO YOU IS ONLY... CHICKEN FEED. OF COURSE. AND IF I GIVE IT BACK, WHAT THEN? YOU'LL PROMPTLY RUN OFF WITH HIM. AH, THERE'S THE RUB. HE GETS YOU ALONG WITH THE CHICKEN FEED, AND YOU'RE MY GOLDEN GOOSE. OH, ALL RIGHT. LET HIM LOSE EVERY CENT. WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY. WE CAN GO AWAY WITHOUT IT. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'LL SAY WHEN HE DISCOVERS YOU STOLE HIS LIFE SAVINGS? AND AFTER TONIGHT, IT'LL LOOK AS IF YOU DID IT TWICE. YOU WON'T TELL HIM ANYTHING. YOU WOULDN'T DARE SHOW YOUR FACE TO HIM. YOU WOULDN'T RISK IT. WHAT RISK? I WAS AN INNOCENT, TOO. NATURALLY I PUT ALL THE BLAME ON YOU. AND I HAVE WAYS OF DOING THINGS. HE WON'T BELIEVE YOU. HE'LL BELIEVE THE CROUPIER, WHOM, SHALL WE SAY, YOU BRIBED TO SABOTAGE HIS BRILLIANT SYSTEM. I'LL SAY IT WAS A LIE. A POOR BOOKKEEPER WHO'S LOST $30,000 WILL BE IN NO MOOD TO LISTEN TO THE LADY WHO SO COLD-BLOODEDLY GYPPED HIM. HE WON'T BELIEVE IT. HE WON'T BELIEVE IT. GIVE HIM HIS MONEY BACK. GLADLY. I'LL BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO GIVE HIM HIS LITTLE BOAT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY LITTLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. ISN'T THAT FAIR? AM I ASKING SO MUCH? YOU'RE RIDING FOR A FALL, BABY. WE'RE ONLY TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM IT. HE WANTS A BOAT-- A SILLY, IMPRACTICAL DREAM. THAT'S WHAT HE REALLY WANTS, AND LET'S GIVE IT TO HIM. YOU'RE VERY CLEVER, WARREN. YOU'VE CLOSED UP ALL THE EXITS. HE WANTED SOMETHING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. MAYBE IT WAS SILLY, AND MAYBE IT WAS IMPRACTICAL, BUT I TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM, AND I'M GONNA GIVE IT BACK TO HIM. GIVE HIM HIS MONEY! HARRY, ATTEND TO IT. GIVE THAT TO FRED. LINDA. LINDA, YOU KNOW I HATE TO PLAY ROUGH, BUT I'M AFRAID IF YOU'RE TO MARRY MR. FENWICK ON SUNDAY, MR. WHEELER WILL HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN TONIGHT WITHOUT YOU. A LITTLE NOTE, SHORT AND TO THE POINT, WILL PROBABLY BE THE QUICKEST, THE SIMPLEST. ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MAKE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE LAST OF IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME. HOLD ALL BETS. NUMBER 8 WINS. I KNEW IT HAD TO START WORKING SOMETIME. "I WAS A FOOL TO THINK IT COULD EVER WORK OUT. "AT FIRST, I HAD SILLY HOPES, "BUT THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS "THAT ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT WORLDS." YES. SHORT AND TO THE POINT. THIS OUGHT TO SEND HIM ON HIS WAY. NUMBER 6 WINS. NUMBER 10 WINS. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE IT, PROFESSOR? 16,000 EVEN. LET IT RIDE. YOU'LL BREAK THE PLACE. NO, THAT'S ALL I HAVE TIME FOR. CAN I HAVE 16 BROWNS? OH, LOOK, SIR. I KNOW WHAT I'D DO. WHAT? WELL, 35 TIMES 1,000 ADDS UP TO ANOTHER 35,000. GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT. JUST ONE MORE. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. PLACE YOUR BETS. PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE.
