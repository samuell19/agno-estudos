This young man has exemplified the true meaning of taking a negative situation and turn it into something positive. Unfortunately, today marks the first anniversary of his death due to gun violence and the big question is, when is it all going to end? Now we're gonna listen in to Councilman Bashir Jones and Devontae William's mother. How are you doing Councilman? - I'm doing well under the circumstance man. This is a always a sad situation when you lose life. When people have to go back to the creator as a result of gun violence. Over 80% of the people who die in this city they die due to gun deaths and mothers have to cry daughters have to bury their fathers. It's a very sad situation but, what I can say, that I'm happy about is the fact that we are here opening up a new business that will be a benefit to this community. His death was not in vain and his life will continue right here inside this beautiful business. So I'm excited to be here with you to be here with the family to be here with the mom and to be with the community members that we have to stop this violence. We have to stop killing each other. It's a beautiful quote that says, "it's not "that we don't love our neighbors like we love ourselves, "we do love our neighbors like we love ourselves, "the problem is that we don't love ourselves." So that we don't love ourselves and obviously I can't love anything that looks like me. So we have to have self love. So I'm here in support of the mom in support of this beautiful family to open up this amazing business , that we hope, not only sell some good food but also promotes love. - You say that? That's a Ricky! - Ricky who? - Ricky Smith, Fly's co-defendant fuck! Man I gotta stop him before he tries something at this reunion. - Thank you. Well we're right here with Devonte's mom right here. How you doing ma lady? - I'm good, how are you? Thank you so much for coming. - Right, you're welcome and under the circumstances is real tough you like to say any words? - Absolutely. Today is a very special day for me and my family. This was a really big dream of my sons and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about Devontae. - Right - Therefore, it's only right that I help him see his dreams come true. Five, four ,three Two, one. - This I'm coming with you if you're not out in here by go there we're shooting nothing in five minutes, I'm coming in - So this is always been a dream of Devantae's. So without further ado, son this is for you, scissors - Up there, the shot came from that window. - You'll right? I got it, go, go - Hey what the fuck! - I had no choice - Then how'd you get here so fast - I received a tip, I didn't have time to call in so I had to just do what I have to do - So you just shot him? - I had to do what I had to do, it was him or me - Listen you get outta here, we'll clean up this mess. - So sorry. So sorry to hear how it happened, so sorry. - Thank y'all for coming - There's no way that.. I know nothing that I can say right now that can make it better, but I just want you to know that whatever whatever me and my community can do to be of assistance to you we will - Okay - we will be here for you, I promise you that. - Thank you. - Promise you that - I appreciate you. - God bless you, okay. - I love you - Thank you sister, thank you - Thank you for coming. Thank you. - Hey you, stay right here sweetie - Hey - I heard it was Ricky up in that building. - Ricky? - I think he was trying to kill Pablo. - It all makes sense now. Girl Pablo just recently found out that Ricky was his son from his ex-wife down in Florida - But what would he have against Fly? - That's a question I'm still trying to figure out. All I know is he never respected the fact that Pablo came back to Cleveland and left him and his family in Florida for dead. - Hey grand dad. - Hey grand baby. Where your grandma at? - She back there in the back. - I see you getting that money, its in your blood line. - My DNA - Is a good thing when we could spend the rest of our lives with the ones we love, we must cherish every moment we get on this earth and make sure we tell our loved ones we love them.
