You and your family can enjoy one of the biggest pools in Latin America, or relax in a real slow river, while enjoying our magnificent gardens. When you're not playing golf, you can cool down in the biggest pool in the world. No, no, no, no! I've told you a thousand times. Where the heck do you want me to put all these boxes? There's no more room here, dear. We just moved the boxes and the mirror to the hall. No, not there, honey. Got it? I have a gym full of people, and it's the only emergency exit we got. I'm sorry, you'll have to move the boxes, and pile them up over there. Give me a hand, will you? I can't do everything by myself. Pay attention next time. Come on in, Beto. Do you have a minute? - Sorry, what? - May I talk to you in private? Yes. What can I do for you, dear? I can't work here anymore. Why? You're not happy anymore? No, ma'am. My co-workers have always treated me well. Don't call me ma'am, don't be so formal. Sorry, force of habit. Is it money? So what's wrong? I've had health problems for some time now. The tanning booth won't start. I know, honey. The technician is coming tomorrow. That's precisely why I put a notice. I didn't see anything. Let me finish speaking with Beto, and I'll see what I can do. Okay? Don't let anyone use it. Close the door, please. What are you sick of? I've been like this for a long time. I can't make physical efforts. I just need to take better care of myself. You know... My mom was sick, with cancer. I was with her until the end. I'm sure if you tell me what's wrong, maybe I can help you. I know what it's like to be sick. Well, Beto... I have to get back to work, but if you need anything, I'll be here, okay? Friends trust each other! It's not that serious, but thanks. Fine, just give me a week, okay? Of course. Anything you need, Silvia. Chivis, call me Chivis. Well, honey, get back to work now. Have a good night. What is an illnes? Why do we get sick and die? Adam and Eve, our first parents were created to enjoy prefect health, but it was their rejection of God what made us vulnerable to illness. A sick person who begs God his healing admits that he has been punished for his sins. We were born to suffer. We were born to suffer, but it's our faith, which makes that suffering glorious. The sick must pray for themselves, and for us too. Amen! Christ showed us the way when he said: "This is eternal life." Illness and sin are one. Let's do what's within our reach, the Lord will take care of the rest. The poor do not suffer, neither the sick, suffering means living without knowing the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord! Praise our Lord Jesus! Bravo! Thank God I'm alive, that we're all alive. God loves you. Hang in there! The truth is I really like this, because God takes care of me and blesses me. That's right, God bless him. It's been hard, living in the darkness, but God has given me faith to go on ever since He noticed me, He's been with me every moment of my life. What's up, Beto? - How are you? - Fine. - What do you want? - The usual, please. - One or two lints? - Two. 80... 90... 100. - You're all set, buddy. - Thank you. - Take care! - You too. Bye. I can't work here anymore. We said one week. Are you okay? Yes. You? Tired. Go and have some rest. - See you later. - See you, then. Sorry... Are you hungry? I always end up doing this. I think I'm used to be alone. You have no idea how useful that oven has been. I work long shifts, I start getting hungry. My looks always scare people in diners. Better to eat here in good company. Have you been like this for some time? Yes. It feels like it's always been like this. ♪YES♪ Sometimes the sick becomes the illness. Like married couples who forget how they were before. I don't know about that, but I've been told. Do you work? Do you feel cold? Or warm? Anything? Where are my clothes? Do you want to leave already? I want to get dressed. Do you want anything for the smell? I don't mind. You see those two over there? New arrivals. Recently deceased. No relation. Still I call them Mom and Dad. They have an almost perfect shade of grey. Minimum deterioration, great preservation. The kid's overe there. He's colored blue, like a scarab's shell. A shade of blue I haven't seen in houses or cars, or sweaters, or socks. I knew this was possible. You're very lucky. Hey... Don't go. Stay a little longer. Something could happen to you out there. You could get hurt. You could be cut to pieces and still exist. You burn, turn to ashes, and... still exist. You could become an eye, and... still exist. An eye. Cheer up, my friend. Hey George. Here baby. Take it. Let's go. Aren't you lucky? Pest control comes in on your last night. So, where are you taking me? - What? - Yes. Maybe I won't see you again. Dinner's on me. I don't think so. - What about you, George? - No. Come on! Let's go somewhere nearby. Let's have some tacos, How about it? Get me another one, please? Thanks. What's for dessert? Cheesecake, flan, and peaches in syrup. Cheesecake... do you want some? Are you sure? Bring me a slice, please. Thanks. Are you having a good time? I want you to have a good time. Let's enjoy this, let's have a good time. What do you like? Do you like beer? Have a beer. No? Go on, take a sip from my beer. Don't be boring. Just eat that bit. A small one. Come on! A bite. A bite won't hurt you. In fact... ...it will sweeten your life. Come on. Great! Shit! Are you okay? So... where do we go now? Tell me about you. What do you want to know? - What? - What do you want to know? I don't know, anything. Tell me about you. About your family. I don't have a family. - What? - I don't have a family. What are you sick with, honey? I know you're sick. But what is it? I'll go for another one. Same. I hate to drink alone. Sorry. I'm hammered. Let's dance. Let's dance, Beto. No, thanks. Just this song, come on. - Come on, say yes. - I can't. Just this song. Come on. Come on, let's dance. You smell like an old man. Fuck! These shoes were killing me. Do you like me place? It's nice. It's yours too. - Thank you. - Sit down. Fucking gross! Hello my love. How's my prince? Have you said hi to Capi? Honey.. Honey! Mommy's here, my love! Where's my beautiful baby? How pretty! How beautiful! Come so Beto can see you. Look, Beto. She's Fiona. Look how beautiful you are! Who loves you so much? How beautiful, my love! I got to go pee. I'll be right back, Beto. Do you like music? It's late, Silvia! What did you say? I can't hear you. So... where were we? Music. We're good, right? - What music do you like? - All kinds of music. I like cumbia. Cumbia is like falling in love. Ever been in love? Have I loved? I have loved, and have been loved many times. But only for a while, fuckers. Then... puff they disappear. Motherfuckers. - People suffer in many ways. - Stop it, Beto. Stop it! Don't be so bitter. Life is meant to be enjoyed, if not why bother? Enjoy yourself! Stand up. Come on. Let's dance. Come on. I've been dancing since I was a little girl. Everybody was jealous of me. Dancing is the best exercise. I talk too much, right? You're just lonely. What about you, asshole? Damn it! The fucking lights went out! Beto, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Could it be the neighbors? Fuck! It's out on the whole building. Be careful, baby. I got to go. Just wait, please... until the lights come back. I'll call you a cab. Halley's Comet. I remember when it came. I was a little girl, and my grandma always talked to me about it. She once asked me... to draw it. She hung it in her place for a long time. I don't know why. It stuck with me ever since. The comet. You were born here. I was born here. I started elementary school here. Then, my mom died. I fell in love for the first time here. Here I went to Cancun for the holidays. I swam with dolphins. I began to work at the gym, and I met you here. Then, I became rich, and bought myself a big house. You came to visit me. You die here. Then, I die here. And the comet returns to Earth here. Then, it goes on alone... across the universe.
