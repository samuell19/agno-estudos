Who dares to disturb the sanctuary of Dracula? Who are you? Wretch! I do not grant favors! I do not accede to the request of minions Don't you know Dracula command... ...even from the confines of this miserable place? This miserable place... Yet you can serve me, Kah. I need your mortal coil I need the form of your miserable carcass I need your vile image I need to walk this earth again. Free from this walls! Free from this mausoleum I will return to your temple in your image, Kah. I will recall the seven golden vampires... ...as my own post! Tools of my vengeance on mankind! I will take on your mantle... ...your appearance Your image! Your image, Kah! Kah, your own image... ...but to beneath the image, The inmortal power... ...of Count Dracula! The legends of Ancient China have their roots in the mist of time Some are awesome and terrifying in their implications... ...some are real and have their foundation in truth. There's a doomed village somewhere in the vast centre of China... ...that becomes cursed each year at the time of the seventh moon. It cringes in fear as it listens to the hearfelt cries of souls in torment... ...and the terror strikes deep into the hearts of the inhabitants The whispered word is "Vampire" and the horror is real and very close Once in a while, some brave man... ...tortured with grief and angry frustation... ...will fight and conquer his own fearful dread... ...and venture outside the walls of this village... ...to do battle with the monsters that torment his people. Some years ago there was such a man A poor farmer who have lost his most treasure possessions through them. His name, so they say, was Hsi Tien-en. I believe the legend to be true. I believe that this is the way the farmer died and in dying... ...he destroyed the seventh vampire One of the cursed creatures that lived enthroning... ...in an order of fear and terror I do not know the location of this village... ...or even the area where in which it can be found But I know it exists, still cursed, still doomed. For of the seven vampire creatures, six still survive. My studies and research into the subject... ...and my own confrontation with an arch-vampire... ...leave me in no doubt whatsoever as to the validity... ...of this particular story. If vampirism exists in Eastern Europe, and I can assure you it does... ...there's no reason to question its existance in other parts of the world. Its fundations, in the beginnings, must extend from Ancient China No one knows better than you, at the faculty of chinese history... ...of this reknown university, that many of your legends... ...are based on thruth and documented experience. Professor Van Helsing, we'd heard of your research in Transilvania... ...and the reports of your confrontation with a certain Count Dracula An undoubted madman. Excuse me, sir. Dracula was not a madman. At least not in the accepted sense. He was the most grotesque creature, the arch-vampire... ...Lord of the undead. This monsters may find sentry... ...in the imagination of the peasants of Transilvania... ...but China has a sofistication that is flowered in bloom... ...over the course of more than 3.000 years. You cannot diminish that sofistication as faking tales... ...of devil monsters and grotesque fiends. - Grant us some intelligence, sir. - But I do. That is why I'm here now I'd like to continue my research with your help Use your knowledge, your facilities. Work with you, have access to your documents. Vampires do exist. I know they exist. I beg you yo listen to me, take me seriously. I'm an outsider, I accept that... ...but I have experience the horror... ...and the aftermath. No one has a greater respect for professor Van Helsing than I, Leyland. But your father is a dedicated outspoken man. I'm fearing that he's becoming some unpopular with the university people. Because of his theories on the vampires legends? Well, these are difficult times. As a brittish trade consul, I have to warn compatriots to trade carefully. I might be allowed to remain here by the local authorities. Any embarrasment could destroy all the goodwill I built up... ...and when there're people like Leung Hon in the city. - Who is he, sir? - A sort of Tong leader. - Awful bloated. - How very jolly! Unfortunately, I cannot pick and choose my guests these days. There must be some you did choose, sir. Ah, yes. Ms. Vanessa Buren, a scandinavian lady. Her husband died two years ago. I believe. - Left her well provided for. - Evidently. - Those earrings must be worth a fortune. - She's in a world tour. Actually, traveling alone. Can't say I approve. I do guess that they want the vote next. She has mine, sir. I do wish she wasn't wearing all that jewelry. If I were a thief, it wouldn't be the diamonds I covet. There's some here that will covet the jewels and the lady. I'll introduce you. Ms. Buren may I present Mr. Leyland Van Helsing? - How you do? - Delighted to meet you. You are the son of the famous professor Van Helsing? I'm so very interested in your father's work. Many people in my country have the greatest respect for his reputation. He'd be delighted to hear that, Ms. Buren. At this time. I would so much like to meet him I'm afraid we weren't be staying in Chungking much longer. - But perhaps before he... - He is here? Yes, if I could meet him. I'd read his books about Count Dracula and his travels in Transilvania. I've to meet a vampire hunter personally... As a point of fact, Ms. Buren, my father is primarily an anthropologist. And I'm fear one that is not catch a vampire. Who's there? Who are you? What it is you want? My name is Hsi Ching, professor. I come to apologize for the behaviour of my countrymen. Their ignorance is to be pity and then dismish. You were at the lecture. I was... ...and I listen most attentive to your words. - Well, thank you. - The truth deserves respect. You believe the legend of the seven golden vampires? Of course. Then I imagine you're the only person in Chungking who does Mr. Hsi. Forgive my intrussion into your rooms. I want to speak to you alone. Please, sit down. - May I offer you some refreshment? - No, thank you. I understand you're soon to leave Chungking. Yes, I shall go to Hong Kong... ...and cath the packet boat back to Europe. Had you heard the story of the vampires before? The name of the farmer who destroyed the seventh golden vampire... ...was Hsi Tien-en. The name of the village is Ping Kwei. ?Hsi Tien-en? ?Hsi! That is your family name! Hsi Tien-en was my grandfather. Ping Kwei is my ancestors village. And the vampires still rule there I don't think I disapprove that ladies travel the world unaccompanied... ...I would say it has its hazzards Ms. Buren. Danger and excitement are like food and drink to me. And fortunately I can indulge myself. - Am I shocking you? - Not at all. Come now, if I were an english gentlewoman... I grant you that might be different. I'm sure I shock our gracious host. - Well, perhaps just a little. - I beg you pardon, madam. "Mr. Leung Hon extends his most cordial and respectful whishes... ...and begs the honor to escorting Ms. Buren to her lodgings... ...and deliver her the benefit of his company and protection". Do give Mr. Leung Hon my sincerest apologies... ...and tell him I already offered to escort Ms. Buren to her home - Do you think he understand? - Yes. He understands alright. I'll get my shawl. You realize what you done? You cause Leung Hon to loose face. Here that is an unforgivable crime. Well in that case, sir, could I trouble you for an escort? We need your knowledge and skills to fight the curse of Ping Kwei. Well... I'll give you all the information I have. You don't understand, sir. We wished you to journey with us to Ping Kwei. We need to take you back with us. - We? - My brothers and I. He'd pledge to rid our people of the vampire curse. We must lift the terrible shadow from our village. But we can't do this alone. An expedition into the inland would require a small army and bearers... ...requires a lot of money, for equipment and so forth. I have a very little, I'm afraid. Are you or your brothers rich men, Hsi Ching? We have nothing, sir. Except our strengh and our willingness. You have no need of guards with Hsi brothers at your side. Now you saw and heard the reaction to my lecture at the university. Nobody believe me, except you, my friend. Now, in the mountains of Transilvania... ...the vampiric legends are very strong. You can almost feel the terror, it has a tangible quality. But here... ...perhaps even I need proof. And you join us if you have that proof, professor? Yes, if the expedition could be mounted Yes, I would indeed join you. Behold then. The golden medallion of the seventh vampire of Ping Kwei. Stop, stop here please. Perfect night for walking, don't you think? I get so tired of sitting around. I'm not a retiring english rose, Mr. Van Helsing. I don't take the blushing and I certainly don't faint away... ...at the first improper suggestion. Wherever comes from a chinese rogue or a very proper english gentleman. A totally emancipated female. I think you might like your women more fragile, perhaps. - Perhaps. - Oh dear, I am embarrassing you. Let's change the subject. I particularly want to talk about your father. I find him totally fascinating. - Are you alright? - Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Ever since you arrived to Chungking... ...you and your son had been under our protection. No harm could be for you. Already your son had witness the skills of my brothers. Kwei, the bowman, and Ta, the axeman. There are four others... ...each one a master of the martial arts... ...and ready to guard you. One thing is certain, father. We can't stay in Chungking. Maybe this trip to Ping Kwei will be the answer. But it needs great deal of finance. - How much? - I'm sorry, madam? How much would this expedition cost? We will need stocks and provisions. Ping Kwei is a long way away. I think... ...perhaps 10,000 chinese dollars, madam. - You'll have it. - What? I'll finance the trip to this village... - ...on one condition. - And what is that? That you take along too. I think a vampire hunt sounds exciting. Ms. Buren, it is quite inadequate A woman couldn't possibly make such a hazardous trip. We'll be going to unknown territory. An area doesn't shown on maps. The countryside is abounded with robbers and briggers. I know. I also have to leave Chungking. I suspect the fate Mr. Leung Hon has bestowed for me... is rather more perilous than the bloody plans for your son. Hsi Ching, perhaps you would explain to Ms. Buren. The dangers are many. If you could believe that my brothers and I... ...will be beside you every moment of every day. Then I'm sure I have very little to fear. I really must protest... It wouldn't do the slightest bit of good, father. The lady has a will of her own. We have a sister. Her name is Mai Kwei. It means "as beautiful as a rose". It would be her honour to attend you. So now, all is in the hands of the gods. We should be ready to leave Chungking by the first light of tomorrow dawn. Stop!. From here, we go on foot. I said no harm would be for you on the journey. It was the most fantastic display, I've never seen anything like it. My brothers would die in your defence. This is our way. You should know more of the others. And perhaps keep their names in some corner of your memory. My twin brothers, the swordsman, Sung y San. Their blades are of burning silver. Chi-Tao, the massive one, he got the mace. And he has the strengh of ten oxs. Po-Kwei. Many years ago he chose the short stepping spear... ...and is now his master. Ta, the axeman y Kwei, the bowman, you already know that. And we must don't forget Mai Kwei, our little sister. May I predict that your son would not easily forget her name. And what of you, Hsi Ching? How did you really find me? Wasn't the chance that brought you to the university, was it? You are a famous man, professor. Oh, no, I don't famous. Perhaps in academic circles found me regarded as an authority... ...in some specialized field but no more than that. Then I put it to you professor: Did I find you? Or where you sent to us? You have fought the arch-vampire. You are the final authority. And you will regress the demons. My knowledge as far as it go is limited to the european heresy. I'd hope to learn something on the East... ...from the faculty of chinese history. As you witness the professors were not forthcoming... ...to say the least of it. When the time comes... ...when you meet the creture face to face... ...you'll know what to do, professor. We are not dealing with mortal beings. What you must understand is that they are already dead. They are cursed creatures... ...craving human blood for their very existence. They are immensely strong... ...and possess black powers that are far reaching. Now fall before them... ...and you too will be eternally dammed. Yet they can be destroy? Oh, yes. They can. They abhor anything that has a holy significance. They fear the word of the Lord. In Europe, the vampire walks in dread of the crucifix. But here... ...it would be the image of the Lord Buda. These are our protection. How you destroy them? A wooden stake... ...buried deep into their heart. Or better still, a silver shot. Fire. What of fire? Not in Europe. In East perhaps. I don't know. There are many things I don't know yet. But one thing I do know: This golden medallion... ...is a symbol of the undead lifeforce. The remain six vampires will do anything they can to retreat it. Once is in their hands again... ...they can reincarnate the seventh vampire. They know we're coming. She's very beautiful. What? Ah, Mai Kwei... Who you think? As she gets you such a smile. Back in my country, that is a open invitation to help with the dishes. Is a strange night, isn't it? Do you think they could be fall in love in this desolate place? I think it is most likely. How nice. They're lucky. They always remembered this moment, whatever happened. Are you afraid? Yes. And yet I'm glad I'm here. Isn't it strange? It would be dark soon. We must find shelter before the sun goes down. The nights are very cold here. I never take another country walk as long as I live. There some caves up ahead. We can rest there. I'll take that, professor. Thank you. I haven't seen a living creature in about three hours. No birds, no insects, not even a lizzard! Oh, is a God forsaken place! That's a very apt description. God forsaken. I like a bath, lots of warm water, perfumed soap. My poor feet! I could do some sleep. About ten days worth! I don't like it. I hate it, professor. Ah, no. I mean the atmosphere... There's something malignant here. I don't think we're going to find a village in all this wilderness. Maybe they forgot their way back.! We can be miles from where we should be! - Leyland, you're a great comfort! - I'm sorry, but I... No, we're on the right track and heading on the right direction. - I'm sure of that. - How do you know, father? Instinct, perhaps. That "I'm here before" feeling. I never seen the place... ...but every detail is cristal clear. Strange and uncanny but it happens ocasionally. You know just what's around that corner... ...even before you turn it. Do you know what is around this corner? We are reaching the village of Ping Kwei... ...and the lair of the vampires. Well, as long as they don't come out to meet us. There'll be food soon. Well I never though I'll be happy to sleep in a cave. We shall be safe here. Wild animals will not venture into the cave. And my brothers will keep watch through out the night. Wild animals? We haven't seen a thing that moves or breath to the last 20 miles. Sometimes... ...it is the darkness that brings them out. Strike to the heart! You're like a beautiful porcelain kitty. And suddenly you're a fighting tigress. Is incredible. - It displeased you? - No, it amaze me. There's three of them. There are three vampires here. Those creatures? they are their victims. The undead. Their slaves along the ages. My brothers cannot survive another attack, professor. We destroyed half their number. Three still remain! Just three demons terrorizing Ping Kwei... ...your ancestors village. And now you want us to turn back? We know these creatures could die! They're not omnipotent! We make preparations. The next time we'll ready for them. Ching, remeber when you came to see me at my lodgings in Chungking. Don't give up now! Over here, professor. The legend is true! Every detail. Over the next hill is the home of my ancestors... ...Ping Kwei. This way. Ching, we must make sure they can't slip far into this trench. We will extend it as far as we can... - ... in the time left to us. - Well. Thank you. Do you think the trench and the stakes would stop them father? For a while, with any luck. What a sinister place! I think Ms. Buren quite like it, you know. No, thanks. Romance florishing in the strangest places. Doesn't it? Hear ye, great demons of hell. Watch your release, thy disciples. Thus do we dedicate ourselves to your service... ...and your command. Light it! Ching, you must destroy her! To the temple. Come on. Van Helsing, across the globe... ...even to this very place, do you prey me! Dracula. Count Dracula. I knew it. I knew it, you'd have to be here. A curse on you and your house! Show yourself. Or must you hide behind the image of another man? Is the mighty Dracula too frighten to reveal his face to me? I am Dracula, Lord of Darkness, master of the vampires... ...prince of the undead, ruler of the damned! - Prove it! - Right. Van Helsing... ...you will once more see my face... ...before you die. Behold, Van Helsing. Look on me, now!
