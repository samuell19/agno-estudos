♪ Multicom Jingle♪ [Sounds of birds chirping] [light piano music] [heavy bass sound] My father came home and saw an envelope. There was a letter and six bullets. On the paper they had written, "With these six bullets we'll kill you and your family." Just a few days after that, they put an empty box at our front door. Inside was a letter that said, "In this box we will bring the heads of your children." After 2003, problems started. [sound of a car driving and muffled people] The villages around us were all Muslim. They harassed us. They would kill you or kidnap you or, [sound of glass breaking] We used to open the door and find messages, threats. "You must leave. You're Christian. You're infidels." "You mustn't live in this country. It's a Muslim country." We were terrified. He couldn'’t even go to work. They said, "If you don't get out, we'll kill you in the store." We were very scared. I was up all night crying and thinking what'll they do to me? What will they do to my daughter? What will they do to my husband? What did we do wrong? We would sit around in fear. Terrible things happened including the kidnapping of students. Eight students were kidnapped. After that, buses were blown up. [explosion sound] I wasn't on the bus that was attached, thank God. I was behind it. Explosions were going off in front of me and behind me. [explosion sounds] When you went to work, it felt like a battlefield. You were afraid. But you had to make a living. They wanted to force us to convert to Islam. There's no way we would abandon our religion for another religion. The persecution only strengthens our faith. The thing they hate most is just that we're Christians. They call us infidels. They're Muslim and they don't want Christians in Iraq. They want to make Iraq their own country. We are Christians, and they said, "We don't want a single Christian in Iraq. We'll kill you." [Light Instrumental Music] Pastor Martin Neumeier lived during the Nazi period in Germany. He saw what was happening. And he had this quote where he said, "When they came for the Socialists, I did not protest because I'm not a Socialist. When they came for the trade unionists, I didn't protest because I'm not one of them. When they came for the Jews, I was silent because I'm not a Jew. When they came for me, there was no one left to protest." [light music strings] The current status of Christians and other non-Muslim monitories throughout the Middle East is the worst it's been in one can say centuries. The western people treat what's happening to the Christians all across the globe as disparate phenomena, and they don't really connect the dots. This is happening in Egypt. It's happening in Iraq. It's happening in Syria. It's happening in Lebanon. It's happening in Palestine. It's happening in all other countries in the Middle East. At least 21 people were killed when a powerful bomb exploded in front of a crowded Coptic Christian church. In November, al Qaeda in Iraq declared open season on all Christians. Gruesome beheadings, mass executions, they call themselves the Islamic State and justify their violent acts by arguing that they are waging jihad, or holy war against Infidels. In 2014, you have ISIS spreading in Iraq and syria. And now you see a situation where we've been ethnically cleansed for our religion and our identity by ISIS. As ISIS pushed forward, Christians knew mercy would not be their life. Tens of thousands of Christians are now fleeing for their lives. The U.N. says more than 500,000 citizens have fled their homes in Iraq. This stream of people, thousands every hour, has been continuing, I'm told, for days across this bridge. And these people and we've seen it, will end up tonight sleeping on roadsides, sleeping in ruined, abandoned buildings. Because there is simply no place else to go. This is the kitchen. It's two families per stovetop. This is the men's bathroom. Same thing on the other side for women. We came to Saint Elijah Church and were just on the ground. The sun was beating down and we were desperately hungry and thirsty without even mattresses. Then they told us about this place. We want to go back home so our kids can continue their education. We want to go back to our homes. The most important thing is to go back. We want them to rescue us from ISIS. We're praying to God to help us and find a solution. One of the most terrifying things that is happening across the region in the Middle East is kidnapping of Christians. And it is especially horrifying for women. One day I was at the door of our house. A car stopped with some guys in it. Their windows were dark so you couldn't see them. Two people got out. They grabbed me and put me in the trunk. They kidnapped me, and after 15 minutes took me out. [sound of trunk opening, body thud sound] It looked like a farm. There were houses. It was a place for animals. [sound of body dropping] They put me inside and tied my hands and legs and put a piece of tape over my mouth. And there were two girls with me. One of them was a doctor, and the other was 13-years old. The doctor was about 35, 36, like that. The first thing they did to me, my hair was long. so they shaved my head. And torturing, of course. They hit us every day with whatever they had at hand. [Sound of match being lit] They put out cigarettes on my legs. They cut us with knives. They raped me. The girl that was 13-years old, on the fourth day they raped her. There were six of them. She started bleeding and she died. To me, they used to say, "Declare your faith in Islam. Swear that there is no God other than Allah, and we'll let you go." Of course, I wasn't willing to say it. So he cursed me, and Christians, and Christ. They told the doctor, "Your family won't pay the ransom." So one of them took out her eye. He put a knife in her eye, and she bled and died right away. They held me for about 12 or 13 days. Afterwards, they called my family. They asked for $100,000 from my husband. He agreed. He said, "I will pay." Even after my husband said he will pay, they kept torturing me. He gave them the money, but still they didn't untie my hands and legs. He paid them, but they just left me there, and they left. [sound of gate opening and heartbeat] A farmer that worked in the area passed by and heard me. He untied my hands and legs. I said I had been kidnapped. I gave him our phone number, and he called my family. I don't remember exactly how they took me home. I wasn't afraid of dying or the torture. My only wish was that, if I die, I die as a Christian. The Christian can always save their life if they will just convert, if they will stop being a Christian. But they're unwilling to, and so that's why, that's why they're murdered. Even in the middle of all this devastation, there is something beautiful going on. And it is the faith of those believers. To say I'm a follower of Jesus Christ means to say I'm willing to die for this. But when you ask them was it really worth it, because you could have converted to Islam very easy and, you know, kept everything, and they say it was worth it. And if we were given the choice again we will do exactly the same. In many ways, what we are seeing now in the Middle East is quite similar to what happened to the Armenians a hundred years ago. Although the Turks have been massacring Armenians for over two centuries, and forcefully Islamizing them under the cover of World War I, they became a target. The Armenians and Syrians and other Christians in the region who were brutally persecuted, crucified, decapitated, raped and so forth, was because it was portrayed as a jihad. The children, the younger ones, they were seen as the hope, as the hope for the family to continue, the people to continue. So they would send them off in batches. A lot of times, they would travel in darkness and others would help them. They would give them a little cash, some food in a bag, and just something that they would carry with them, and they would walk. My grandparents traveled by foot, and they traveled from today east Turkey through Iraq, through Syria, and they settled in Egypt. On my recent trip to Armenia, Turkey, and Iraq, we visited four refugee camps. And when we were in one of those camps, I saw a young man that was maybe 14. And this young man had lost both his parents. He was there with a younger sister, maybe of the age of six or seven. And the weight of the world was on his shoulders. He was all of a sudden the man of the house. And all of a sudden, I remembered my grandfather, who had walked. Now, I speak Arabic, being raised in Egypt. So I was able to speak in Arabic and encourage him, and tell him listen; I'm here to show you hope. My grandparents were exactly where you are today. Their family was gone. Their belongings were gone. Their home was gone. Everything was gone. They had nothing but their younger sibling. But they kept on with hope. They kept on with faith, and I exist today because they didn't give up. Within just a few decades of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek genocide, the Middle East witnessed yet another campaign of ethnic cleansing. [Instrumental music picks up] Well, the Jewish communities in the Middle East and in North Africa were living there for thousands of years. In the middle of the twentieth century, all the Jews disappeared from all these countries. [Sound of crowds of people] I was 16-plus when we, my father decided that this time has come to try and escape. And that is in the backdrop of the public hangings in January '69. There were nine innocent Jews who were all hanged that morning And their bodies were shown in public squares of Baghdad and Bosra. People were dancing under the bodies. So by the time 1971 arrived, we had no choice. We had no choice. There was not a life. It was really a walking death. So my father said we are going to try and escape. We will have a few days until we reach safety. I feel it as if it was yesterday, how we set up, how we left the house, how we had to pretend that we were just going around, you know, just for the couple of hours. And how we got into the car, final look at the house, final look at all the things that was in the house: my treasured school reports, my collections, my stamp collection, my keyring, my matchboxes, you name it everything that we have accumulated in a lifetime. It was just going to be left behind. Then there were the checkpoints, and the checkpoints were terrifying when they arrived because you can see the slow signs. And then you get there, and then you lower the windows, and the guns get into the car. And then they asked my father to step out with his paperwork. And then you're sitting in the car. You don't know what to do. You don't know, my grandmother was praying in a loud voice, and we were begging her not to. And my father would have to convince them why do we want to be picnicking in that part of Iraq. And my father would assure them that all we have to do is just another few kilometers and then we'll come back. And so on and so forth, until we had to cross the mountains to Iran, all in total and absolute darkness. Because these mountains were exposed. And if there was a light of the car, then it would be shot. So that was really the most frightening part of the journey. [sound of car stopping] At one stage, the car just stopped right there was nothing. There was just a hill. And it was getting cold. The person who was driving it instructed everybody to get out of the car, completely out, out, out. And we were saying are you going to abandon us. Where are we here? And he said don't worry. Now you are safe. And we were like looking at each other, and it was the release of almost eight years of hell. They call this ethnic cleansing. This is the real word. Let's face it. Today, you can see the same happening to the Christians. If we don't care now, the statistics later will be mind boggling. We must think not about religion or Christianity in the abstract. We're talking about real people. We're talking about families who for generations have lived their faith, are wanting to pass on their faith peacefully. What is taking place in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, is genocide. It meets the official definition of the United Nations, it is the eradication of a particular ethnic religious group. And they are facing extinction. One aspect of genocide is the destruction of historical artifacts because these extremists are trying to make it as if these people never existed. [sound of explosion] This video purports to show the radicals destroying Nimrod, one of the most important archeological sites in Iraq. In the past week, ISIS vandals took hammers to ancient relics in the nearby Mosul Museum. We're seeing 5,000 years of history being erased in just a matter of a few months. We're seeing this kind of destruction of antiquities, history that we can never get back. It is not by chance that they are targeting not only communities but also their very heritage. Churches, mosques, shrines, temples, cultural historical sites. The church that dates back to the 4th century in my village, doesn't belong to my village, and doesn't belong to me. It belongs to the whole world. These people have lost everything. They've lost their homes, their land, their safety their history. And yet, when you visit these IDP camps, when you visit these refugee camps, among the young people there is still an incredible resilience and incredible hope. What do you want to be when you grow up? Teacher. Teacher. Doctor. Journalist, so I can help my people return to their homes. All those people here, before they have their big houses, but now they lose everything. Two families. My grandmother sleeps on the floor. We have no place to sleep. What do you miss most about Karamoja? My friends, my teachers, my class. When we used to go on journeys, picnics to school. [Music Swells] Mass immigration, to the point where the lands are emptied of its indigenous people does not work, for the very simple reason that we are tied to our land. They don't want to leave. They want to be there. They want to be in their villages. They want to be where their mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers walked. And they shouldn't have to leave. We risk the possibility that Christian communities present in the Middle East might cease to exist. So right now you have a very small, faint candle flicker of a light that is our people. And for every church that is blown up, every town that is emptied of indigenous Christians, you are one step closer, one flicker of the wind closer to that little faint flame being extinguished, and us not existing anymore. These fanatics hate Christians. In the beginning, they wanted to get rid of them and chase them away. If you allow them to continue, and the world does nothing, their final aim is to rid the world of Christians. This is happening, first of all, above and beyond the Middle East. This is in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Islamist extremist group Boko Haram have said they carried out a wave of fatal Christmas Day bombings against churches in Nigeria. It's in as far as Indonesia, the Philippines. It's happening in even European areas that have large Muslim populations. Scenes of carnage at six different locations across Paris. At least 129 people were killed in Friday's attacks which Islamic State says it carried out. Breaking news from San Bernardino, California. The worst extremist attack on America since 9/11. A rampage now believed to have been inspired by the Islamic State. Pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS as the couple turned a holiday party into a killing field. Terror attacks in Brussels, and tonight the casualties mounting, with multiple explosions, at the airport, and in the subway. According to a new report, ISIS has unprecedented levels of support inside America. ISIS terrorists in all 50 states. We must fight extremism, not only for the sake of our brothers and sisters, but also because they are at the frontline against an enemy that has clearly shown us that it will bring the fight wherever it can. ISIS released a new video today showing the execution of 21 Coptic Christians. The video shows the Egyptian prisoners being marched onto a beach by militants dressed in black. Then the prisoners are beheaded brutally. Christians in Egypt go back to really the 2nd century or even earlier. St. Mark the evangelist who wrote the gospel of the same name is the one who evangelized Egypt. [religious chanting] To the Coptic community, faith is everything. It's the one thing that sustained them throughout these 1,400 years of Islamic rule of Egypt. And they were able to maintain their religious identity. They were able to maintain their large, large number. And to maintain that number throughout 1,400 years of persecution for most part, and discriminations for the other part of it, is all because of faith. For me, growing up as a Christian in Egypt was a tough, a tough process, actually. Laws and regulations and everything that was on the books kind of treated you as a second-class citizen. For generations, Copts have had to put up with the unspoken rule that bars them from holding senior positions in the government, army, or security services. And during outbursts of Islamist terrorism here, Christians were targeted. Churches are routinely bombed and burned. A car packed with explosives and parked right in front of the church, burst into flames. The apparent suicide bombing killed at least 21 people, and wounded 97 more. We've had over 60 churches burned in one day, on August 6th, 2013. Mobs began attacking Christian churches. [mob chanting] If the devil came down with all of his soldiers, he would not do to this church what the Muslim Brotherhood did. Looting. Destruction. The church was an exquisite masterpiece. Coptic Cristian women and girls are often abducted and kidnapped. On the 17th of August, they declared me a Muslim, and a couple of days later a marriage contract was drawn up in a car. While the state does nothing for Christian girls being abducted and forcefully converted into Islam, Muslim converts to Christianity face terrible consequences. Muslim converts to Christianity in Egypt, and they are not few, face a lot of persecution. Muslims who wish to convert to Christianity are often arrested, and there's usually a pretext given that's not because they converted. They'll say something like sedition or something else. And it can get to the point that you get killed. A PEW research survey finds nearly 90% of Egypt's Muslims believe those who leave Islam should be killed. After I finished my high school I went to the law school in Alexandria to become a lawyer. I witnessed the persecution and the discrimination that took place against the minorities in Egypt. Especially the Christian minorities in Egypt. Which make me wonder why there is persecution happening to the Christian minority. It's my belief that you don't torture or persecute somebody unless you are scared from the truth that they carry. I started to read the Bible. I started to believe in Christianity. I converted from Islam to Christianity. [sound of water] On August 15, 1998, I was arrested. I was taken to Abu Zabel Prison, what we call back home "hell on earth," and I was tortured for seven days. [Gasping for air] From shaving the hair of my head, to putting my head in cold and hot water, to hang me upside down, beating me, releasing dogs to attack me, to crucifying me for two days and a half. And at the end, they made a cut in my my left shoulder to the bone, and they put salt and lemon in the open wounds. I don't know how many people believe in miracles, and how people doesn't believe in miracles. Before they released the three dogs to attack me, I prayed. And when they released the three dogs, the three dogs refused to attack me. They are trained to listen to their master. But it is in my opinion there is no higher master than Christ. And that's how God saved me from these three dogs attacking me. And this was my miracle. Until now I have nightmares. My nightmares is not about my torture. My nightmares is about when they put me in the prison. It was a torture section. It was underground. And there was another nine rooms besides my room that they used to torture the people. And you could hear women getting raped, men getting tortured. And they would scream from pain, and they would ask for mercy. Until now, I can hear them in my sleep. The Egyptian government charged me with three charges. that I tried to make a revolution against the Egyptian government, that I tried to change the official religion of Egypt from Islam to Christianity, which I didn't, and that I love and I worship Christ. And I will tell you what I told the judge in this day. If loving and worshiping Christ is a crime, I am guilty as charged. And after that they give me a death penalty, which usually take place by hanging. After that, I was able to escape before my death penalty take place. I escaped to Sinai. And when I escaped to Sinai, my friends told me you cannot leave the country. You are in the black list, and you cannot escape to any other country, really, because Egypt is surrounded by Arab Muslim countries. So if I went to Libya, Sudan, Saudi Arabia all of these countries will re-arrest you, will torture you, will send you back. So the only country that was not Arab Muslim state was Israel, the Jewish state. And what I know about Israel or the Jewish people at that time, that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. It was simple logic. So I took a jet ski and was able to escape from Taba to Eilat and I became a free man in Jerusalem. Many people aren't aware that even Muslim minorities are persecuted by their fellow Muslims. [bomb explosion] A deadly car-bomb attack at a mosque, the explosion rocking morning prayers and killing four. Muslim Sunnis are persecuted by Muslim Shi'ites, in such places as Iran or Iraq. Shi'a militias have killed dozens of Sunni civilians. Attacks against towns or Sunni mosques are frequent. And Muslim Shi'ites are persecuted by Muslim Sunnis in places like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. A suicide bomber struck at a Shi'a mosque in Saudi Arabia. You're talking about a disease that is not affecting one group alone, but it's affecting everybody. And that's something might be controversial to some people but this is the fact. We cannot change realities. This is the fact and we have to protect these people. Of all the non-Christian minorities facing persecution today, the persecution of the Yazidi people, who've lived in Iraq for thousands of years, is possibly the most painful to witness. When thousands of Yazidis fled an ISIS onslaught, many brought with them horrific memories. According to a United Nations report, ISIS then gathered all males older than 10 years of age, took them outside the village by pickup trucks, and shot them. But the women suffer a fate that may be worse than death. Sold into slavery, sometimes many times over, to suffer unimaginable brutality. Captive women have been bought and sold across Iraq and Syria, like cattle. He showed me a letter and said, This shows any captured women will become Muslim if 10 ISIS fighters rape her. Then Noor says he raped her. After that, he gave her to his friends. She says each one raped her. How many men did he pass you to? One day there were 14 girls with me. They tried to kill themselves by drinking rat poison, but they took them to the hospital and cleaned their stomach. They told us, "We'll not let you die so easy." We're talking about child sexual trafficking, the rape and the sale of children on a stunning scale. They captured all of us. They separated my husband from me. They forced him onto his stomach and shot him twice. We experienced horrifying things. The most difficult was seeing women and girls taken to be sold. They took one girl for three days. Ten men raped her. She was 12-years old. Someone grabbed me and took my baby. He said, "This is not shameful. Now you're my wife." They locked me and my baby in a room. He was crying. There was no water I shouted and banged on the door. I broke open the door. I gave water to my baby. I took a deep breath. I closed the door and ran. We had a lot of difficulties until we reached safety. When I got to the Kurdish police, I called my brother and he found me. After, we decided it's impossible to stay. We must leave the country. So we began preparations all the papers and everything, so we could travel. Four or five days after I was released, my husband was in his car coming back from work. My son and I came out. We saw another car behind him. Four people got out. They grabbed him. They didn't ask for anything. They beheaded him. The threats kept coming. "You must leave the house, your stuff, your cars." I decided I had to take my children and escape. Right when I decided to get out, they came to me at night three or four guys. We had gold and money in the house. They took it and gave me 24 hours to leave. So I had to take my children and get out of Syria. After my son saw his father's beheading, he stopped speaking. Syria is famous for its churches and monasteries. Lots of places you can pray. I heard about a Monastery of St. Takla. High in the mountains. So I went up there barefoot. The whole way up, I was praying and crying. During this time I also lost my father. I said, "It's over. I've lost so many. I just want my boy, my child to speak." And the very next morning, he woke up, and he said, "Mom, please make me breakfast." I was so happy. I didn't want to travel. I wanted to go back. But while in Syria, I heard about all the killing in Iraq. I realized it's not possible to go back. And then I was approved to come to the United States. It was wonderful because my children finally had a future. Those who are able to escape from ISIS did not do so unscathed. Every refugee I've spoken to has been left with scars from a horror that they will never forget. Everybody fled Qaraqosh. Everybody locked the doors on their houses and fled. They left all their belongings and fled. After ISIS took over, the problem worsened. They cut off our electricity. And then they cut off our water. And then they cut off the supplies to our area. After about two months, when the army retreated, ISIS invaded a little after 5 in the morning. [explosions] My brother was running. He had gone to the security forces. He said, "ISIS is going to invade." We were scared to death. The Peshmerga fired their guns in the air to wake people up. [gunfire] So everyone packed their things and we ran. ISIS attacked with mortars, which landed in the middle of town. [explosion] The town was besieged. [explosion] [screams] After that happened, we escaped. We were seven people in one small car. my two children, my husband, and my relatives. The road was packed. Cars bumping into each other. Both sides of the road became one direction, to flee. Even the median was packed with cars. Any path that had room had cars on it. We had a very old car. I put my children in and we escaped. At the main road we saw the bodies of dead children, men and women who had been killed, corpses on the side of the road. I believe they shot over 100 bullets at us. Many bullets hit my car. The sound of bullets was nonstop. You didn't know if they were hitting enemies or friends You didn't know if it would hit you you or where it came from. We were anxious for 11 hours. Add to that our fear, and the sound of children screaming and crying. I mean, the women, we didn't know if at any moment we might be captured or we might escape. My son kept telling me that they will kill us I kept calming him, saying, "No, they don't kill us." Eventually, we were all crying uncontrollably and just terrified. We didn't know what to do. We were low on gas. [car beeping and explosion sounds] And our car had about eight people. The car was scraping the ground. Finally, we went off-road. The car would've gotten stuck. There had never been a car there before We cleared rocks by hand and drove through. People were fleeing and leaving their homes behind. Will they die of starvation? Will they be killed? Will they be sleeping in the streets? They didn't think. They just fled. Just running, car after car. People just running and crying, crying because of what happened. That's how it was. We felt like we looked death in the eyes. Though I'm here, I'm constantly thinking of our people. It's still hard to sleep. They are all I can think about. We think of their fear, how they were killed, and all that. We fled and took what we could because we were terrified. We left behind most of our things. We fled with our wives, our daughters, our children, to escape ISIS. We left our lands. We left our memories. We left everything and ran for our lives. The world many times over has vowed "Never again," and then another atrocity comes, and we say, "Never again". If we're going to say never again, then we should actually do something. Often people will say it's so overwhelming to read the paper or to hear the news. And they say what can one person do. There is a certain frustration. I will be the first to admit that. Sometimes when you see a massive problem, you feel helpless. You really don't know what to do. If people are opening their hearts and minds to this, and are learning about this, they cannot walk away saying we'll pray for them, and we'll feel bad for them, and that's all we can do. You have a voice. And doesn't matter how small is your voice. You can make a difference, even if you are just one person. What we try to do is connect a system where we can connect from abroad to the homeland. If somebody in the U.S. or in Europe wants to send any kind of help or any kind of direct impact, we're basically like a bridge. I mean, that's our strength, is abroad, and if they can help us to strengthen ourselves in our homeland, y ou know, why not? There's a cry for help from here. And you know, these small things like coloring books, something as simple as this a five-year-old child will remember it forever. And that's what we try to focus on, just making the kids forget about their situation for a couple of days. Thank you. [acoustic guitar] [kids singing] This new wave of ISIS is not something new. It's something that we've dealt with for a very long time. This is how, the Middle East went from being really Christian majority, which most people don't even know at this point, to being almost entirely Muslim in certain areas. And so they're in fact, there is regions right now that have no Christians at all that a century ago they did. It's pretty much unless something fairy dramatic is done, we will see the extinction of Christianity in that region. We're watching a real genocide unfold in real time. And when something happens on the other side of the world, we know it immediately here. And that knowledge bears with it responsibility. All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. There are some things in life that are worth fighting for. Freedom is worth fighting for. Okay, protection of your family is worth fighting for. Stopping genocide is something worth fighting for. They are taking our land. They are killing us, and no one is paying attention to us. Look at these people. Why are they being killed, forcing them to emigrate, making them flee. And the most powerful countries are just sitting and watching us. And nothing is being done. Why? Why is this happening? Let them stand with us. "One hand can't clap on its own." Let them stand with us. We will not be silenced regarding our rights. [Acoustic Music] ♪ Multicom Jingle ♪
