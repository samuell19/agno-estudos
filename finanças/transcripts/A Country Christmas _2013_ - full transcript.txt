GOOD MORNING, ARIZONA. I'M ANDERSON HEMMER. THERE'S BREAKING NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS MORNING, WHEN THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT TO BAN THE BELIEF IN SANTA CLAUS CAME TO A HEAD EARLY THIS MORNING. THE SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED THE VOTE 82 TO 18 TO BAN THE BELIEF IN JOLLY OL' SAINT NICK. AND SPEARHEADING THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT ON THIS IS OUR OWN ARIZONA U.S. SENATOR MAX SCHMUCKER. AS A GENERATION, WE HAVE FAILED BECAUSE OF OUR GREED AND OUR FOLLY. OUR CHILDREN FACE A HARD FUTURE RIFE WITH STRUGGLE AND TURMOIL. WE CAN'T PREPARE THEM FOR THIS HARD FUTURE BY FEEDING THEM A LIE ABOUT A JOLLY, FAT MISANTHROPE WHO COMES IN THE NIGHT AND GRANTS THEIR WISHES. WE MUST TEACH THEM THE LESSONS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED. WE ARE ALL, EACH ONE OF US, IN CHARGE OF OUR OWN DESTINY, AND THEREFORE MUST GRANT OUR OWN WISHES. ON THE LOCAL FRONT-- WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GUY? WHY AREN'T PEOPLE BELIEVING IN SANTA ANYMORE, DADDY? I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART. DAVID BAXTER SAYS IT'S BECAUSE NO ONE CAN SEE SANTA. WHO CARES WHAT STINKY OLD DAVEY BAXTER THINKS ANYWAY. JUST BECAUSE SOME SENATOR DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T, RIGHT? YEP. THAT'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE BUS, GUYS. LAST ONE TO THE BUS IS A POOPER SCOOPER. YOU GOT YOUR HOMEWORK? GOT IT. ZACH, YOU GOT YOUR HOMEWORK? WAIT UP, ZACH. OKAY. SENATOR SCHMUCKER, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE PRESIDENCY? SENATOR, ARE YOU CONSIDERING A CAMPAIGN? LISTEN, IF A RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY'S IN THE CARDS, I'LL CERTAINLY TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY, BUT IN THE MEANTIME ALL OF MY FOCUS IS ON REMOVING THE SANTA MYTHOS FROM OUR CULTURE AND CERTAINLY OUR SCHOOLS. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE OUR GOVERNMENT'S WORK TO DO. SENATOR-- VULTURES, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. THEY'RE NOT LIKE VULTURES, MAX. THEY WON'T UNTIL YOU DIE BEFORE THEY EAT YOU. YOU KNOW, MAX, I HOPE YOU DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS WHOLE SANTA THING. IF THEY WANT YOU TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMY. OKAY? I WILL. IF THEY ASK SMART QUESTIONS, I WILL ANSWER THEM. TEETH. MM, LOVELY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU SAY. WELL, THEN DON'T. DRIVE, CAN WE JUST MOVE ALONG, PLEASE? CAN YOU BACK UP FIRST? SO ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS TOURED THE COUNTRY DEBATING THE MORALITY OF SLAVERY AND THE LOGIC BEHIND IT. NOW, WHO REMEMBERS WHAT YEAR THESE DEBATES TOOK PLACE? MILEY.

LEGISLATION BANNING SANTA CLAUS HAS PASSED. THERE'S NO MORE SANTA CLAUS. YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM IN CLASS. NO PICTURES, NO SANTA CLAUS. YES, SIR, I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU.

BESIDES, WE ARE GUESTS IN THEIR HOME. YOU CAN BE A GUEST ANYTIME, SANTA. WE SAW THE GLOW EARLIER. MY SISTER SAID SHE SAW YOU. HM, IT SEEMS SHE DID. BUT HOW DID YOU GET HERE? WELL, THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. WE GOT HERE-- HM. WE GOT HERE-- HOW EXACTLY DID WE GET HERE, ELLIOT? I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD-- YOU SEE, WE TRAVEL THROUGH A SERIES OF MAGIC PORTALS THAT TAKE US ALL AROUND THE WORLD. PORTALS? YES, LIKE A MAGIC DOOR OR A PASSAGE. RIGHTEOUS. RIGHTEOUS INDEED. SO THE LAST THING I REMEMBER, WE WERE GOING AROUND THE WORLD AND CHECKING TO SEE IF THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE IN THE FINE TOWNS OF TIMBUKTU AND KALAMAZOO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE FOUND OURSELVES HERE IN HOPE, ARIZONA INSTEAD OF THE NORTH POLE. THERE MUST'VE BEEN A SHORT IN THE SYSTEM. HM. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK? WE CAN'T. WHATEVER THE GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM IS, WON'T ALLOW US. SYSTEM? YOU'VE USED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. OH, ELLIOT, IT'S OKAY. THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. THE MAGIC PORTALS ARE NOT WORKING THE WAY THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AT THIS MOMENT. THAT MEANS YOU'RE STUCK HERE WITH US? HM, IT WOULD SEEM SO. YOU CAN STAY HERE FOR EVER, SANTA. OH, MILEY LOGAN. YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRA SPECIAL HEART. HOW DO YOU KNOW HER NAME? ZACH, I KNOW ALL THE NAMES OF ALL THE CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD. WOW, SO IT IS TRUE. SO WHAT NOW? WELL... FIRST OF ALL, YOU MUSTN'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT US. IT'S ONE OF THE SPECIAL RULES THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW. RULES? OH, YES. EVEN SANTA HAS RULES. IN FACT WE HAVE A RULE BOOK. WHOA, THAT'S BIG. THERE'S ONLY ONE PAGE? I HEARD THEY HAVE WRITER'S BLOCK. RULE NUMBER ONE. NEVER SHOW YOURSELVES TO MORTALS. OH, UH, UNLESS WE ENCOUNTER THE OCCASIONAL ACCIDENT, OF COURSE, LIKE YOU SEEING US. RULE NUMBER TWO. WE CAN NEVER USE OUR POWERS FOR EVIL. WHO WOULD WANT TO? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T EITHER. RULE NUMBER THREE. AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF ALL. WE MUST NEVER INTERFERE WITH THE LIVES OF MORTALS IN ANY WAY. HM. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU BREAK A RULE? DON'T KNOW. NEVER DONE IT. YOU THINK WE COULD TRUST THEM? YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH US, SANTA. SCOUT'S HONOR. I BELIEVE YOU, ZACH. YOUR PARENTS WILL BE BACK SOON. HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU BEST GET HOPPING. OKAY. WAIT, IF YOU FIX YOUR GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM, YOU WON'T LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE, WILL YOU? OF COURSE NOT. SCOUT'S HONOR. OH, WAIT. IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS MAR ON MY REPUTATION IF YOU LEFT MY PRESENCE WITHOUT A LITTLE SOMETHING. THANKS, SANTA. WHOA, LET ME SEE. COME ON. STEVE WAS FINISHING SHOEING BUCKY, AND HE KICKED, AND STEVE ABOUT JUMPED OUT OF HIS BOOTS, AND, WELL, AND SOMETHING ELSE. SO HOW WAS SCHOOL? FINE, I GUESS. THEY STARTED TAKING DOWN THE SANTA DECORATIONS. SO THAT'S WHERE THE POSTER IN YOUR ROOM CAME FROM. MM-HM. WELL, I LIKE IT. IT WAS, LIKE, LIFE-SIZE. LIFE-SIZE? NOT EVEN CLOSE. HE'S A GOOD 6' 7" AT LEAST. REALLY? OH, YOU KNOW, SO I'VE BEEN TOLD. I MIGHT'VE READ IT SOMEWHERE. HM. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT NECKLACE? GUMBALL MACHINE AT SCHOOL. ANYWAY, THAT SCHMUCKER GUY HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WELL, HE'S ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION. EVEN IF WE DON'T LIKE IT. HE'S ENTITLED TO A LOT MORE THAN THAT. HM. LOGAN POWER. HONEY. I'M GOING TO GO DO THE BARN CHECK BEFORE DARK. NO, DAD. WHY DON'T YOU LET MILEY AND ME DO IT? YEAH, DAD. I APPRECIATE THE OFFER, BUT DON'T Y'ALL HAVE SOME HOMEWORK TO DO? AT LEAST LET US HELP YOU. WE'LL GET OUT HOMEWORK DONE. PROMISE. HUH, I DON'T FEEL A FEVER. READY TO DO IT, THEN? MM-HM. LET'S GO. GO. ALL RIGHT, HOMEWORK RIGHT WHEN YOU GET BACK. LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU. DON'T KEEP THEM OUT TOO LONG. I WON'T. WAIT, WAIT, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE. WHAT IS IT? UM, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE. YOU SEE, LEROY AND DUKE MIGHT NOT BE READY FOR YOU YET. MM-HM. LEROY AND DUKE MAY NOT BE READY? YEAH, DADDY. ANIMALS NEED THEIR PRIVACY, TOO. IS THAT SO? YEAH, THEY TAUGHT US THAT IN SCHOOL. OH. MY TAX DOLLARS HARD AT WORK, HUH? OKAY. THINK THEY HAD ENOUGH TIME?

PRETTY DARN GOOD, AREN'T THEY? ALL RIGHT. Y'ALL TAKE THIS WHEELBARROW OVER THERE AND CLEAN SOME STALLS. DAD, DO YOU WANT ALL THE STALLS OR JUST DUKE'S? THANKS. ANYTIME, JOE. I GOTTA LAY OFF THOSE HABANERAS CLEAN THEM ALL. OKAY. MAN, YOU ARE SO CLEANING THE FIRST ONE. MILEY. LET'S GO. WOW. COOL. HO, HO, HO. IF ELLIOT AND I CAN'T BE AT THE NORTH POLE TONIGHT, I THOUGHT I MIGHT BRING A BIT OF THE NORTH POLE TO US. HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE? OOH, NOT LONG AT ALL. NOW YOU SEE IT, AND NOW YOU DON'T. WOW. COOL. DO THAT AGAIN. HO, HO, HO, HERE WE GO. NOW YOU SEE IT. AND NOW YOU DON'T. UH, NOW YOU SEE IT. NOW YOU DON'T. UH, NOW YOU SEE IT. NOW YOU DON'T. OOH. WHAT'S WRONG, SANTA? I'M NOT SURE. IT'S LIKE TONIGHT, WHEN DAD WAS HERE, THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL. YEAH. THE GLITCH IN THE HITCH. MUST BE WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. WHERE DID THAT HITCH OF YOURS COME FROM? WHY, FROM YOU OF COURSE. ME? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING-- FROM ALL OF YOU, FROM THE WHOLE WORLD IN FACT. YOU SEE, IT'S YOUR BELIEF IN ME THAT PROVIDES THE MAGICAL MOMENTS THAT SURROUND ME. IT'S QUITE SIMPLE REALLY. SO IF PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING. THEN THE MAGICAL MOMENTS STOP AS WELL. SAD BUT TRUE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU, SANTA? WELL, I SUPPOSE EVENTUALLY I WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. NO, YOU CAN'T, SANTA. OH, NOW, NOW, NOW. WE MUSTN'T WORRY ABOUT THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. ALL WILL BE FINE. ALL IN GOOD TIME. OKAY. SANTA'S NOT DONE YET. IT MUST HAVE TO DO WITH MAX SCHMUCKER'S PLAN TO BAN YOU FROM CHRISTMAS. SCHMUCKER? HE WAS ON THE NAUGHTY LIST FOR YEARS AS A KID. OH, SWEET LITTLE BOY. A BIT DIFFICULT, I SUPPOSE. HE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN-- NOTHING MORE THAN A SAD LITTLE BOY WHO NEEDED LOVE AND AFFECTION. IF THERE'S ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED IN THESE MODERN TIMES, IT'S THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS. YOU THINK HIS PLAN TO MAKE PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING IN YOU IS CAUSING YOU TO LOSE YOUR MAGICAL POWERS? WELL, IT IS A CAGEY COINCIDENCE. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE, SANTA. THE DAY AFTER SCHMUCKER CALLED FOR THE VOTE THIS ALL STARTED TO HAPPEN. WELL, WE'VE WEATHERED THE STORM OF NONBELIEVERS BEFORE, AND WE'VE ALWAYS COME OUT ALL RIGHT. BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS A GLOBAL MOVEMENT. OH, DEAR. YOU MAY BE RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO LET THE WORLD KNOW YOU'RE HERE, SANTA, THAT YOU EXIST. BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. WE CAN'T WILLINGLY SHOW OURSELVES TO MORTALS. YOU REMEMBER. EVEN IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY? EVEN IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. MORTALS SPOTTING US IS ONE THING, BUT US WILLINGLY SHOWING OURSELVES, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, NO MATTER WHAT. OH, HAVE FAITH, LITTLE ONES. THE MAN UPSTAIRS HAS A PLAN. HE ALWAYS DOES. NOW, I SEE TWO CHILDREN WHO OUGHT TO BE IN BED. THE NAUGHTY AND NICE RULES STILL APPLY DESPITE THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE TWO OF YOU SNUCK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE WITHOUT PERMISSION. NOW, ELLIOT, I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN THIS ONE CASE. BUT I-- BUT WE ARE GUESTS, LIVING IN THEIR BARN. WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE? NOW, THAT'S A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER TIME. COME ON, NOW, OFF TO BED. OKAY, GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. MAY YOU DREAM OF CANDY-CANE KISSES AND MILK-CHOCOLATE STARS. OKAY, I THINK THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP. AWESOME. HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP SANTA? WOW. OH, I GOT IT. WHAT? SANTA SAID HE COULDN'T KNOWINGLY SHOW HIMSELF TO OTHERS, RIGHT? RIGHT. BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE DISCOVERING SANTA ON THEIR OWN. LIKE WE DID. OKAY, SO? SO ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS GET SMUCKER, THE MEAN DUDE, TO DISCOVER SANTA FOR HIMSELF. ONCE HE SEES SANTA'S FOR REAL, HE'LL HAVE TO CALL OFF THE MOVEMENT. AND SANTA WILL GET HIS MAGICAL POWERS BACK. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT? LEAVE THAT UP TO ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'LL SEE. I'M GETTING US OUT OF SCHOOL TOMORROW. KIDS, COME ON. LET'S GET A MOVE ON. BUS IS GOING TO BE HERE. ZACH? ZACH? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? OH, MY.

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU'LL SEE. THAT SHOULD DO IT. YOU SEE, THOSE MOTION SENSORS SENDS A SIGNAL TO THIS BOX THE SAME WAY THE SCHOOL BUS DOES WHEN IT COMES ONTO THE DRIVEWAY. THAT WAY WE'LL KNOW WHEN DAD COMES THROUGH THE GATE. GREAT IDEA. AND ALL WE GOTTA DO IS RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE AND WAIT FOR OUR CHECK-IN. I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU ON THIS ONE, ZACHY. NOT BAD FOR FIFTH GRADE, HUH? PLAYING HOOKY FROM SCHOOL. THAT'S DEFINITELY A VIOLATION. OH, ELLIOT. NOW, YOU TWO LOOK LIKE YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

ZACH AND ME AGAINST HIM. TWO KIDS AGAINST A WORLD RENOWNED POLITICIAN? WE FIGURED WE HAVE THE ONE SECRET WEAPON THAT HE DOESN'T. OH, WHAT'S THAT? WE KNOW YOU EXIST. HO, HO, HO. SO TELL ME THIS.

WE'RE HERE AT THE FAMILY HOME OF MILEY LOGAN, THE LITTLE GIRL FROM HOPE. THAT'S ME. OH, BOY. THEY'RE HERE? JOE. HI, SWEETHEART. ARE YOU MILEY LOGAN? ARE YOU SANTA'S LAST HOPE? UH... GO BACK INTO THE PARLOR. GO. DADDY? LISTEN, Y'ALL. MILEY WILL BE PREPARED TO MAKE A STATEMENT IN ABOUT AN HOUR. ALL RIGHT? SO HANG TIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MAX, WE GOT PROBLEMS. THOUGHT IS SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED WHILE I'M IN THINK-TANK MODE. SURE. LISTEN, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE THIS. WHAT IS IT? MILEY, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO SENATOR SCHMUCKER IF HE'S LISTENING? YEAH. MY CHALLENGE STILL STANDS. ANYTIME, ANYWHERE. BUT SINCE I CAN'T DRIVE, MY BARNYARD WOULD BE IDEAL. WOULD IT? SANTA EXISTS, AND I CAN PROVE IT. SENATOR SCHMUCKER'S TAKING ON POLITICIANS. NOW LET'S SEE HOW WELL HE DOES AGAINST A NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL. YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME. AND THIS IS ONE REPORTER THAT CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS DEBATE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE PHONES HAVE BEEN RINGING OFF HE HOOK. THAT'S WHAT PHONES DO, SUSAN. SO WHAT? THIS LITTLE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT GOING AWAY, MAX. OF COURSE IT IS. LIKE ALL CONTROVERSIES, JUST LEAVE IT ALONE LONG ENOUGH, AND EVENTUALLY IT'S YESTERDAY'S NEWS. GLOBAL WARMING, GLOBAL DEFORESTATION, AND NOW SANTA CLAUS. TRUST ME. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. YOU COULD BE RIGHT. OF COURSE I AM. BUT IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU WILL NOT ONLY BE IGNORING THE CHALLENGE PRESENTED BY A HARMLESS LITTLE GIRL. YOU'LL OPEN YOURSELF UP TO CRITICISM FROM ALL YOUR OTHER CHALLENGERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, MAX. IF YOU WERE TO MEET WITH THIS LITTLE GIRL AND INDULGE HER IN HER LITTLE FANTASY... WIN HER OVER. PRECISELY. TURN THE LION INTO A FRIEND, AND THE REST OF THE DEN WILL FOLLOW IN LINE? MM-HM. PERFECT. AND THEN SOON THEY'LL ALL FORGET ABOUT SANTA CLAUS AND HIS PITIFUL BAND OF LITTLE ELVES. YOU SAY THAT AS IF YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN HIM. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. SOMETIMES YOU SCARE ME, MAX. HELLO? HE'S COMING. HE'S COMING. HE'S COMING. HE'S COMING. WHO? WHO? SCHMUCKER. HE'S COMING TO HOPE TOMORROW. THAT'S WONDERFUL, MILEY. YOU ROPED A BIG FISH. OH, I HEAR YOUR DAD. GO ON, GO ON. OKAY. DO YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE THE KIDS HAVE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH TIME IN THE BARN LATELY? I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE WORSE. AT LEAST THEY'RE HANGING ON THE RANCH. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL, DOING THEIR OWN THINGS. FORGETTING WE EVEN EXIST. THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL. JOE, I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. MY DADDY COULDN'T SEE IT. MY MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE TO REASON WITH HIM. SORRY, BABY. WE GOTTA TELL THEM, JOE. NO, YOU ARE. OH, NO, I'M NEVER MAKING IT TO THE BUS FIRST. HI, MOM. WHAT'S WRONG? IS IT ABOUT SCHMUCKER? BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY DOING WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. NO, SWEETIE. IT'S NOT ABOUT SCHMUCKER. YOU'RE-- YOU'RE SICK AGAIN. AREN'T YOU, MOM? NO. YEAH, MOMMA'S SICK AGAIN. NO, MOMMA, YOU CAN'T BE. MILEY, SOMETIMES WE JUST DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THINGS LIKE THIS. OKAY? DOES THIS MEAN-- ARE YOU GONNA DIE? DYING IS A PART OF LIVING. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO APPRECIATE EVERY DAY WE HAVE WITH EACH OTHER. IS THE CANCER BACK? AND IT SPREAD. NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE CANCER. YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN HAVE CHEMO. YOU CAN BEAT IT. RIGHT, MOMMY? MAYBE I CAN'T THIS TIME. PLEASE, MOMMY. I LOVE YOU. PLEASE DON'T DIE. I'M SORRY. NO. I'M SORRY. MILEY! MILEY! SANTA, WHAT'S WRONG? THE CHILDREN. SOMETHING DREADFUL IS WRONG. I NEED YOUR HELP, SANTA. MY MOM, SHE'S SICK, VERY SICK. YOU NEED TO HELP HER. MILEY, I-- PLEASE, SANTA, YOU HAVE TO. PLEASE DON'T LET HER DIE. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T. BUT YOU'RE SANTA CLAUS. MILEY, EVEN IF I COULD, MY POWERS HAVE ALREADY LEFT ME. I'M AFRAID MY TIME HERE IS SHORT AS WELL. NO, BECAUSE I BELIEVE. YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING... MILEY, STOP THIS. LET ME GO! JUST LISTEN TO ME, OKAY? THIS ISN'T ANYBODY'S FAULT. THIS ISN'T SANTA'S FAULT. THIS ISN'T EVEN SCHMUCKER'S FAULT. MOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR US. THIS TIME WE'VE GOT TO BE THERE FOR HERE. OH, DEAR ONES, I'M SO SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. CAN I SLEEP IN YOUR BED? THERE YOU ARE. DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, MOMMA? I WANT TO. I REALLY DO. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I WANT? WHAT? FOR YOU TO KNOW IN YOUR HEART, THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I WILL ALWAYS BE WITH THE TWO OF YOU. JUST LIKE SANTA? YEAH, JUST LIKE SANTA. NOW, YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BIG DAY TOMORROW. OKAY. GOOD NIGHT, ZACH. ZACH. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. * SILENT NIGHT * * HOLY NIGHT * * ALL IS CALM * * ALL IS BRIGHT * * ROUND YON VIRGIN * MOTHER AND CHILD * * HOLY INFANT SO TENDER AND MILD * * SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE * * SLEEP IN HEAVENLY PEACE * ARE YOU READY? I THINK SO. YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT. THANKS. JUST SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. OKAY. WE WANT SANTA! WE WANT SANTA! WELCOME, SENATOR. THANKS VERY MUCH. YOU'RE HERE. UH, MAX. YES. IF THINGS GO SOUTH, JUST REMEMBER. HM? USE IT. GOOD DAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. AND NOW I WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO WELCOME THE ESTEEMED SENATOR FROM OUR GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA, THE GRAND CANYON STATE, SENATOR MAX SCHMUCKER. SENATOR SCHMUCKER WILL ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS BEFORE WE BEGIN. SENATOR SCHMUCKER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR SCHMUCKER. THANK YOU. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY WE HAVE IN HOPE. I LOOK FORWARD TO AN EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL DEBATE WITH YOUNG MILEY. FIRST I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS UP FRONT. YEP. SENATOR SCHMUCKER, YOU'RE CURRENTLY KICKING OFF WHAT MANY EXPECT TO BE A LENGTHY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WHY TAKE THE TIME TO DO ALL OF THIS? WHY? DEMOCRACY, FRIEND. CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE. THEY DESERVE TO BE HEARD EVEN WHEN THEIR IDEAS ARE A LITTLE, SHALL WE SAY, MISGUIDED. SO YOU THINK MISS MILEY'S BELIEF IN SANTA CLAUS IS MISGUIDED? I-- HEY, THERE SHE IS. WHY DON'T WE ALLOW YOU TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES. YEAH, MILEY. YEAH, MILEY. OH, MILEY. UH, THANKS. KILL HER. GOOD DAY, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS ANDERSON HEMMER, AND WELCOME TO THE CITY OF HOPE DEBATE BETWEEN ARIZONA STATE SENATOR SCHMUCKER... AND OUR VERY OWN MILEY LOGAN. THANK YOU. WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN. SENATOR SCHMUCKER, YOU WON THE COIN TOSS, SO YOU MAY CHOOSE TO DEFER OR BEGIN. WELL, SINCE MILEY HAS THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE, I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY WITH MILEY. UH, SURE. EXCELLENT. FOLKS, I MUST ADMIT I'M NOT JUST HERE TO TALK ABOUT SANTA CLAUS. I HAVE MUCH GREATER CONCERNS. OUR CHILDREN. GROWING UP AT A TIME WHEN DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT IS NO LONGER AN ACT OF REBELLION. GROWING UP COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL POLITICIANS ARE LIARS AND CROOKS THIS COULD ONLY LEAD TO APATHY. I CAME HERE TODAY TO SHOW AT LEAST ONE CHILD THAT THE GOVERNMENT CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE TRUTH. DEMOCRACY IS NOT MAKE BELIEVE. FAR TOO MANY HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FIGHTING FOR ITS VIRTUES AND VALUES. SANTA CLAUS... IS MAKE BELIEVE. WE DON'T NEED TO BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS. WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES. WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER. THANK YOU, SENATOR. MILEY, IT'S YOUR TURN. I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT'S MAKE BELIEVE BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. YOU KNOW, WHAT IS MAKE BELIEVE? LET'S SEE. IS LOVE MAKE BELIEVE? IS HAPPINESS MAKE BELIEVE? IF SO, I GUESS MR. SCHMUCKER'S RIGHT. SANTA'S MAKE BELIEVE, TOO. NO. BUT IF LOVE AND HAPPINESS ARE REAL, THEN SANTA'S REAL, TOO BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT SANTA IS. IT'S NOT WRONG TO BE HAPPY JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAD. I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT WITH THAT. QUIET, PLEASE. QUIET, PLEASE. I KNOW THERE ARE SAD THINGS. THERE'S A LOT OF SAD, SAD THINGS. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE BELIEVE IN THE SADNESS MORE THAN WE BELIEVE IN HAPPINESS. LIKE WE THINK WE DESERVE TO BE SAD. ISN'T THAT WEIRD? BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE, WHAT MY FAMILY HAS TAUGHT ME TO BELIEVE, FOR STAYING STRONG IN THE SAD TIMES, FOR BELIEVING EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE AT THEIR WORST, WE DESERVE TO BE HAPPY. WE DON'T JUST NEED SANTA. WE DESERVE SANTA. THAT IS VERY SWEET. I APPLAUD YOU. ISN'T SHE SWEET, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? LET'S GIVE HER ANOTHER HAND. MILEY, MILEY. YOU HAVE A MOST UNIQUE IMAGINATION. YOU TRULY BELIEVE THERE'S A SANTA CLAUS, A SANTA CLAUS WITH A BAND OF MAGICAL FLYING REINDEER. OF COURSE I DO BECAUSE HE IS REAL. HE EXISTS BECAUSE OF OUR BELIEF IN HIM, AND WITHOUT IT-- WITHOUT IT, I GUESS MR. SCHMUCKER'S RIGHT. THERE IS NO SANTA CLAUS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU WON'T LET THERE BE. SO I ASK YOU ALL, DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S NO SANTA CLAUSE OR DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD FULL OF MAGIC, LOVE, AND HOPE BECAUSE THAT'S WHO SANTA IS AND WHERE HE CAN BE FOUND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. FOLKS, EXCUSE ME. GAVE THE YOUNG LADY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I ONLY ASK FOR THE SAME. MILEY ISN'T LYING WHEN SHE SAYS THAT SHE TRULY UNDERSTANDS GREAT SADNESS. HER MOTHER RENAE IS SUFFERING FROM TERMINAL CANCER. DON'T. DON'T. I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER TO PERSONALLY REIMBURSE THE FAMILY FOR ALL OF MRS. LOGAN'S MEDICAL EXPENSES. SECONDLY, MILEY, I HAVE TO ASK, WHILE YOU MOTHER IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE, YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR SANTA TO CURE HER OR DEPEND ON THE TIRELESS EFFORTS OF HER DOCTORS, DOCTORS WHO WILL USE TREATMENTS WROUGHT FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH, EXPERIMENTATION, AND EVIDENCE. CAN YOU, MILEY, OR ANYONE ELSE HERE, OFFER ONE SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT SANTA CLAUS EXISTS, ANY? ANYTHING. NO. NO, I CAN'T. WELL, I GUESS THAT SORT OF SETTLES THINGS, THEN. DOESN'T IT? HEY. HEY, SCHMUCKER! MILEY! MILEY! COME HERE! LET GO OF ME. STAND DOWN, PAPA BEAR. I'M JUST GOING TO TALK TO HER. BACK OFF! RENAE. I'M REALLY SORRY, SANTA. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MILEY. WE HAD A GOOD RUN. OH. THIS MEANS YOU'RE LEAVING US. DOESN'T IT, SANTA? I MIGHT BE LEAVING. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER. WHAT? I WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU IN YOUR HEART, AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AND TO ZACH FOR BELIEVING IN ME WHEN OTHERS DID NOT. WELL, LOOKIE-LOOKIE, WHO'S GOT THE COOKIE. HELLO, MAX. SANTA. WAIT, YOU KNOW SANTA CLAUS? WE'VE MET. THEN WHY DID YOU SAY HE DIDN'T EXIST? WHY? THIS IS WHY. WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THIS TO A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY? WHY? I'VE WONDERED MY WHOLE LIFE. WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS? LOOK AT IT. BLACK PIECE OF ROCK. MY DEFINING MOMENT, EVERYTHING WAS BECAUSE OF THIS, WAS BECAUSE OF YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF? YOU HAD SO MUCH, MAX. YOU HAD A BEAUTIFUL HOME, YOU HAD A BOUNTIFUL TABLE AND EVERY TOY THAT ANY CHILD COULD EVER WISH FOR, EVERYTHING THAT MONEY COULD BY, BUT YOU REALLY ONLY NEEDED ONE THING. OH, YEAH? WHAT IS THAT? LOVE. LOVE, MAX. THAT-- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY-- OH, IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH. AND IT IS NO FAULT OF YOURS. YOUR PARENTS THOUGHT ALL THOSE TOYS AND THINGS WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY, BUT REALLY ALL ANY OF US NEEDS... IS LOVE. MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE... I WANTED YOU TO LOOK INSIDE, MAX. NOT AT ALL THE TOYS AND THINGS THAT YOU HAD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT AT THE LOVE THAT YOU WANTED AND NEEDED ON THE INSIDE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SAY NOTHING. LOVE IS SILENT. LOVE IS STRONG. LOVE IS ETERNAL. AND YOU CAN KEEP THAT IN YOUR HEART FROM NOW ON. EXCUSE ME. SOMETHING I GOT TO DO. SENATOR SCHMUCKER IS HERE, AND HE WILL ADDRESS THE CROWD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. WHAT? I-- I'M SORRY. THE SHOW IS OVER, FOLKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WANT OFF THE RIDE. IT'S OVER. IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT. SIR-- TECHNICAL ISSUE. OH! YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING, SENATOR. YES. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'VE-- I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH. WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS. THANKS TO THIS HARD-WORKING, HONEST FAMILY I'VE LEARNED SOME LESSONS TODAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO. I WON'T TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR GOOD PEOPLE'S TIME. I KNOW YOU HAVE FAMILIES TO GET HOME TO. I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE LAST THOUGHT. AS CHRISTMAS APPROACHES, LET US ALL EVERYONE LOOK INSIDE, DEEP INTO OUR HEARTS, AND EMBRACE THE MOST MAGICAL GIFT... LOVE. MS. SATCHER, MS. SATCHER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF? CARE TO COMMENT? PLEASE. NO QUESTIONS. NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. HO, HO, HO, HO, HO. OH, THANK YOU. ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY SPECIAL TIME FOR US. OH, DEAR ONE. I LOVE YOU. OH, MILEY. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE TO GO NOW. OKAY? OH. THAT A TEAR, I SEE, ELLIOT? NO. S-SOME HAY IN MY EYE. HO, HO, HO, HO, HO. HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! HO! SHH. ZACH. WHAT IS IT? SHH. OH, BOY. UH, UH, UH... WHAT JUST... HAPPENED? I BROKE A RULE. IT'S GONE. THE MAGIC. I THINK I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S THE PRICE. I'M MORTAL NOW. I'M-- I'M NO LONGER SANTA CLAUS. THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT. ELLIOT. THE WORLD JUST STARTED BELIEVING IN SANTA. YOU CAN'T BE GONE. THE WORLD HASN'T LOST SANTA CLAUS, ELLIOT. YOU CAN'T BE SANTA WITHOUT YOUR MAGIC. NOT ME, MY FRIEND. YOU. YOU'RE THE HEAD HONCHO NOW. I I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE MORE FIT FOR THE JOB. I CAN'T BE YOU, SANTA. OH, OF COURSE YOU CAN. YOU KNOW THE RULES BY HEART.
