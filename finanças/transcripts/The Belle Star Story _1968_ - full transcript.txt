- Well? - Two hundred dollars. - Check. - Damn it, I'm all out of luck tonight. Here, my two hundred. Let's make it a thousand. - I'll check a thousand. - So will I. - Is this good enough for you? - I'll be damned. Having such luck makes me sick. Boys, I'm done for tonight. Too much luck! I don't like this table... I don't have any cash left. Will you accept horses? I own the best farm around. I usually stick to money, but for you, I'll make an exception. - I'll lend some to you. - John, hasn't she cleaned you enough? - You wanna lose your panties too? - He doesn't need a nanny, lay off. He could hang himself, I wouldn't care. - If you want to stop, then say so. - No, I'll continue. - Me too. I would never abandon a game with such a beautiful stranger... One I hope I'll get to know better. - Alright, John, go ahead. - I'll open it. - I fold. - I stay. - Me too. - Two cards. - Two. Two more. Your turn, John. My turn. Raise to five hundred. Well, let's make it a thousand. - I'll check. - As will I. - Two jacks. - Three kings. Oh, just wait, plus three aces. - And she even jokes about it... - Can I bother you? Are you the famous girl dressed as a man that everyone's talking about? Seems like you're skinning them alive. I was dying to meet you... You don't seem so dangerous after all. Good job. I see you've earned quite a bit, good job! Now, listen... What if we leave these three cats alone and you play around with me, instead? Maybe you're afraid. Are you in? If you have money to lose, then, why not? This way, gentlemen. Here are the cards, a brand new deck! Is that good, Larry? Just what I needed for a deadly game, right, dear? Want anything? How about some champagne? Do you want some champagne? No, I never drink when I'm playing. What's the limit? With me, there are no limits, honey. No limits at all. Good. Neither do I. So, shall we make it... A thousand? A thousand it is. Two cards. Two for me. Let's make it two thousand. No. How about... Three thousand. Let's make it five, then. There... Just because I'm curious. I only have two jacks. And I only have two queens. Can't win every time... I like the way you play. You're not afraid to risk it, are you? It'll be a very entertaining evening. - Full Aces. - Great. Now you'll be forced to stop, you've lost everything... - No, I want to keep going. - She has nothing. - I'm having fun... - Anything we can do for you? - Yes, go to hell. Come on, let's get out. Listen, do you accept this ring? It's worth quite a bit. It's worth over fifteen thousand dollars. "Clean cut", are you up for it? - You never give up. - Never. Alright, "clean cut" it is. Two nines. - Nice hand. - There's no way! - You've won. - With two nines... Pity. I'm done. I'm afraid we have to stop, I have nothing left to bet. Are you sure? I'm willing to play all of this, even double, if you want... - Betting against what? - A night with you. Of course, it's an indecent proposal. A decent woman wouldn't bet such a thing on a poker game. I was just rambling, to keep our game going. Miss Mairabel! Miss Mairabel! Miss Mairabel! I knew you would've refused. You're wrong, my friend. You don't know me yet. I agree... Shuffle, come on. - Another "clean cut"? - No, regular. Three cards. Three for me, as well. Two nines again. I think you won this time. No, I can't even beat those. Pardon, I was just trying to be a gentleman... Well, undress on your own, if you prefer... "Veuve Clicquot" From my personal reserve. The only thing I like about Europeans, their French champagne. As you can see, I have a refined taste... I'm not an ordinary cowboy. Actually, I'd say I'm a true gentleman. I won't even take a peek while you undress. And yet, I'm certain that the spectacle deserves a sweet look... ... For someone like you. It's not every day that a woman must take off her pants before making love. You're a strange type, looking so confident. Walking around with gun, dressed like a man. Playing poker in the saloons. But then, you act like a child. You could've won that hand, and still come to bed with me, right? Why would you ever throw away those three queens? Throwing away the perfect hand, it's a crime! Oh, by the way, I'm sorry if I took a peek walking out, But I told you, I'm a very curious man. You shouldn't play with guns, dear! - Bastard... - You could get hurt! Come on, let's go... What a mean girl you are! - No! No... - What do you mean, "no"? You threw away that hand to come to bed with me. Now, stay there. Are you crazy? Good girl... Why did you find that excuse? If you like something, you must take it... I want more... Stop moving around! Surely, I'm not the first man in your life, right? Miss Mairabel! You're a tigress... I still can't believe it, you know that? I've never allowed any man to come close to me. - The only one that tried, is dead. - And you wanted to kill me as well. I could've... I saw you in the mirror, I had all the time I wanted to shoot. - But you didn't. - No... - Champagne? - Yes. By the way... I still don't know your name. What is your name? Larry Blackie. Have you ever heard that name before? I'm quite well known, my dear. If corpses had signatures, the cemetery would be filled with my autographs, - Around these parts... - Larry Blackie? Larry Blackie! But, of course... How wouldn't I know? Missouri, Texas, Kansas, Virginia, they know you all over! - Don't you worry about that... - Who said I was worried? What about you? ... Who are you? Belle Starr. Belle Starr?! What are you laughing about? Are you the terrible Belle Starr? What's there to laugh about? Stop laughing! Stop it-- I'll laugh when I feel like it. You think you can give me orders? For me, you're just a "call-girl", Ready to serve whenever I want to. And you're the same for me. I don't buy it, cutie. Anyhow... If you want to keep playing with those pants and those guns, do it far away from here. This is my territory, I don't like competition. Not even from a woman. Got that, little one? I have a happy trigger. I wouldn't want my gun to go off suddenly. Thanks for the poker game. You've only won the first hand, you son of a bitch! What took you so long? I was worried, did something happen? - No, nothing happened. - Look! I found it near the village. We have to leave, you're wanted in this state as well. - It's too dangerous. - For us, anywhere is dangerous. Fifteen thousand is tempting for anyone. One day, even you will want to hand me over to the sheriff for the reward. Stop joking, Belle, let's leave this place. That guy from last night is Larry Blackie, this is his territory. He won't like it if he finds out you're here, sooner or later he'll come at you. I know, that's exactly why I decided to stay. Why do you want to provoke him? He's an ugly bastard. - And fast with his gun, too. - We'll see if he's faster than mine. I thought you lost this at poker. That bastard... He thinks he's paying me off with this. Go into town and find out where he is, which saloon, which county! - Why? What will you do? - I'll teach that scum a lesson... And don't come back until you find where that bastard is! He'll regret this... Here I am, boys! No! Not with the horse! Damn you, sucker. Give that to me, I'll show you how it's done. What a show-off! Who called me a show-off? And what are you laughing about? Fatty. I don't know you, are you new around here? Let me take a look! Don't you know that it's good manners to introduce yourself? - I'm Butch, and you? - Rosita! Nice to meet you! Knock it off Give me a hand, you seem like a gentleman. You dare to leave with another man while I'm here, fatty? Leaving me for that young boy, you haven't learned anything. - Who is that boy over there? - Never seen him around these parts. Who knows? How long have you had boys allowed in here, Nevada? I'm after Larry Blackie. I was told he's a regular around here. I don't know anyone by that name. Hey, boy, can you tell us who you are, or is that a secret? - I must find him. - Ask those over there. Are they part of his gang? I didn't say anything. So, will you grace us with answer? Who are you? Are you deaf? Be careful, son. He's fixated, you should answer, he's a rather dangerous man... Hey, bartender! Tell him that I don't like to ask for something twice... I might just lose my patience. Hey! Turn around and answer. I asked what your name was, boy. If you were a man, I'd already shot you. You're a stubborn one, eh? That means you don't know who I am... I'll give you thirty seconds, if you don't tell me who you are... I'll kill you. Now... What is your name? It's your funeral, then! You bastard! Johnny! Boss! What is going on? Don't shoot first, throw this instead and keep your eyes peeled. Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Johnny... Johnny! Johnny... My brothers... Wait... Wait a minute! Don't shoot... Look, I have money. There's over $5000 here. It is all I have from the cattle sale, but it's fine... Take them, boy. Take them, and leave! Be careful, it's a trap! Shoot, Dick! Scum! Now, you can know my name. My name is Belle Starr. No time for love. What can I do? I only want a love that's true. The one my heart is looking for. This love to last, for evermore. No time for love, what can I say? Love comes along, I run away. But I will stay, the day I see my love at last has come to me. Bad timing? Oh, it's you... I was told you were looking for me the other night. The ones that survived did. They said you put on a show for me. I wasn't the one that started it. I know, I know... You're innocent. They provoked you. But you took out four of my men, and I didn't like that... - What did you want? - I need to give you this. You won the game, it's yours. And I don't accept gifts from you. We could always bet for it again, with poker... I decide when I want to play. You should be more humble, Belle Starr. Why don't you just admit that you like me? Everything would be simpler. But, you can't. You're not just another girl! You're the "terrible Belle Starr." Gossip falls right through the mouth of the drunkards at the saloon... Who knows if you're even as good as they say-- You be the judge! - The heels! - You're too tall for my tastes. And you talk too much. Now, get out of here. Get out! Get out, I said! - Don't come any closer. - Why's that? Don't get any closer! ... Why? What would you do if I get closer? Will you shoot? - Shoot, then! - Get out of here, Larry Blackie. I don't want you around anymore. Really? Let's see... Next time, it won't be your hat, mind you. Go away! You're different. You're sweet when you surrender... You don't even look like Belle Starr. Belle Starr... Belle Starr does not exist. It's the name I used to bury all of my mistakes, leaving them behind. All of us try to hide our mistakes, behind our guns. Belle Starr... What a pretty name. Very pretty... Is it real? Or did you make that up? No... It was a cowboy who gave it to me. Two years ago... A cowboy by the name Cole Harvey. He was a crazy boy, living like a wild foal on the plains of Virginia. That was a time in my life when I didn't even know what to do. I had moved out of my father's house. I lived off hunting, in the great woods near the lakes. It was there that, one day, we met. How's the water? Cold? Give me back my clothes, you damned bastard! Give them back, you scum! A lady shouldn't go around without her hat! Stop laughing! Stop it, you will regret this! Give me back my clothes, you son of a bitch, I'll kill you! You shouldn’t make threats when you're in underwear, lady! Stop, stop! Stop, you damn rat! Stop, you bastard! Give it back! Scum, give me my gun back! You're too skinny! Women need some meat in them! Give me my gun, if you have the guts. But, of course! Here it is, cutie! It's empty, damn it! I'm a gentleman, but not a crazy one, dear! Take it. What is your name, bastard? I'll kill you for what you've done to me. I'll look for you in every state of the Union. You don't recognize me? You have a poor memory, Ms Mairabel. I'm Cole Harvey, remember me now? Cole Harvey... I don't believe you, cowboy. I knew Cole, he was my friend. He would never act so foolishly, not with me at least. Come to find out, it's actually me, Cole Harvey. I recognized you right away, even if you don't wear braids anymore... And your face is clean now. Come, Massachusetts... Let me introduce to you the daughter of the Colonel, Ms. Mairabel Shelly. Don't call me like that, I don't carry that name anymore. Call me Belle. "Belle"... That's French for beautiful! Imagine that... Belle, and the last name? Why not Belle Starr? Hey! Belle Starr! It's a beautiful name. - Fine, I'll think about it. - Alright, think about it, Belle Starr. From that point on, I called myself Belle Starr. Me and Cole decided to stick together. Were you attracted to him? As you are to me, now? What went on between the two of you? Nothing, he was merely a friend. We grew up together. He was the son of one of the cowboys that lived with us. Just imagine, he was the one that taught me how to shoot and ride a horse. In the end, he was the only true friend I'd ever have. That's why I stayed with him, deciding to live like a man. We grouped a small crew, unfortunate, crazy cowboys like us. We lived off stealing cattle from the rich owners. We only took what was necessary. We became professionals. Sometimes the owners called the army, and they tried to catch up to us. But we never got caught, they couldn't even get to us. After each job we spread out, the boys went their own way, to drink and play. While me and Cole returned to the lakes. We had it good, those were fine times. But you haven't told me why you decided to run away from home. What happened? It was because of my father. My father, Colonel Jonathan Shelly. Ah, I don't feel like talking about it. As you wish. It doesn't matter, it's such an old tale. Mother died when I was young, and my father... I barely knew him. But I adored him, he was courageous, he was a hero. Ever since I was a little girl, he was a myth to me. I learned how to shoot and how to ride... Just for him. The day he returned... The entire house was vibrating. And I felt deeply happy. My father was coming back, and he was bringing me a splendid gift! A boyfriend... Imagine that, from Saint Louis, they brought three baskets full of dowry. Night gowns, blouses, skirts, purses. Anything that would drive a girl mad. All that just to look prettier, for my future husband. His name was Don Clarke. I had never met him, but they told me he came from a good family. Heir to one of the richest families in Missouri. My father brought him, someone as wonderful as himself... I prepared for that meeting full of hope and fear. Hoping Don Clarke would find me as attractive as he imagined. Maybe I was too thin, too tall... I wanted be worthy of him and my father. That's why I was so excited. I was shaking from the emotions. Just like any girl would, knowing she's bound for love... That's when I saw him, old, ugly and repulsive. The husband my father prepared for me... ... And once you become governor, you'll be able to help old friends... I say old friends, but by then, we would have become family! Oh, of course, we'll have Virginia in our hands. Don't worry about the New Yorkers, I have a plan for the plantations-- Oh! There she is, Don! This is my daughter, Mairabel! Don't be fooled by her girly looks, she's as savage as a cowboy. Mairabel, this is Don Clarke, your boyfriend, you'll get married in a week. I was waiting for this moment. I'm honored. But I must warn you. I have no intentions of marrying you. Mairabel! I told you, Don, she's as wild as a foal. Unfortunately, my dear Jennifer left us when she was just a child. With the war and politics, I was always missing, she grew up around cowboys. But once she marries you-- I'll remind you, father, I told you I'll never marry this man! How dare you?! You will marry Don in a week, I gave him my word of honor, understand? Your word, not mine. She very witty, your daughter, I like her! You're very kind, but she... She only understands the whip. I was away, for far too long, she doesn't know me that well. You're mistaken, father. I know you now, but you don't know me. Don't worry. These wild foals become the best wives, all you have to do is tame them! - Whipping! - I'll handle that... I ran away like a lunatic. From that moment, my father was forever shattered in my heart. I only wanted to run away. Run away from that disgusting old man. From my father, and that house, which I could not live in any longer. I don't think that little story is the reason your bounty is now up to $15000. No, for me, that part of my life was closed. I was already gone. I lived freely amongst the crew. I didn't think about my father anymore. But I had yet to find out that death was written in my destiny. One day, I was with Cole... No, I never leave my gun behind. I'd feel naked without it. From what I know, it's the only law that counts around these parts. I'll gain some respect for myself, I've been getting better at shooting. Of course, you're right. You're a good shot. But watch out, here in the west, the cemetery is full of good shots. Not good enough, clearly. And that, honey, is all that matters. Whoever shoots better, wins. What is that? Those are the Greenwald bells. It's an execution. They'll hang an Indian girl. It was Jessica, the Indian girl that I grew up with. She was always a happy creature, good-mannered, until... Until that night. Until that damned evening when my father returned... That night I went to him for a final explanation. Before leaving him forever. Leave me alone, boss... A wild cat, that's what you are! Your mother, at your age, wasn't so feisty... - Give me your ass! - No, no, let me go! - Stop moving! - No! Throw away that knife, you filthy Indian! Stop moving, you whore. I'm the boss, it's better if you keep me happy... No! Filthy animal, are you not ashamed? And you, get out! You made a mistake nosing around. You thought you saved her? I'll have her hanged! And I even admired you... Adored you, even! My father, the Colonel, my hero! I've finally understood who you are... A corrupt being, vulgar, vile, freeloader, so much that you'd sell me to the first rich, old man just to become governor. - Disgusting! - You're making a mistake. You will regret that just like your mother regrets-- So, it's true... It's true what they say... It was you that had my mother killed! With your brutality, and your wickedness. You're courageous only at home, but that's too easy... It's far too easy to seem courageous towards women... - You're scum. - Mairabel! I'll teach you how to speak to your father! I'll break you apart, and you'll beg me to marry Don Clarke. - You'll have to kill me. - I'm ready for it. Be careful, you don't know me! I'll gouge your eyes out! Never! You don't scare me anymore... I adored you, but that is over! You're nothing to me, I despise you, I despise you! You made a mistake by challenging me, Mairabel! Mairabel! And now, my father planned on hanging Jessica... I couldn't let that happen. Could you tell me where you're going? Looking for trouble? What, is it a secret? - Want to come with me, Cole? - Of course... Thanks... But I have to go in alone! It's my business, Cole. Nothing to do with you. It's a debt I have to pay back on my own. If you try to follow me, I'll stop you. Even if I have to shoot you. Would you really shoot me? - Are you crazy? - Steady, Cole, be careful! Keep in mind, I'm not bluffing around this time. Wait, Belle! Belle! At least leave me with my gun! Belle! I ran like the wind to the village, there was no time to waste. I knew she was innocent, I couldn't bear with the burden of her murder. The sweet, innocent, cheerful Jessica. But when I arrived, the rope was already around the neck. And my father was there, sitting, enjoying the show... He gave the signal to proceed with the execution. In that moment, I felt such hatred towards him, towards every man, giving me the steadiest hand I've ever had. I'd known him for quite some time, the town's sheriff. His name was John Caster. He had two children, and a small blonde wife with a perky nose. But I had to shoot him. Otherwise he would've caught up to me. I killed him... That was the first time I killed a man. How do you feel? Better... You can calm down, the worst has already passed. Thank you, Belle. It was my duty. My father tried to rape you again, I imagine. And you fought back... Right? How do you know? I know him well enough to say he's vile... What was that? What's wrong? Belle, I feel better now, let's get out of here. Get everything ready. Mairabel Shelly! I knew I'd find you here. Lower that rifle! Go away. No, dear, I can't allow a Shelly to be hanged like a common criminal. You are my daughter, I'm the one allowed to kill you. Oh, is that how it is? You're worried about the family's honor? Go ahead then, come and kill me, I'll be waiting... Be careful, Mairabel, you think you can scare me? John... John! Call the others. Give me a gun. Leave the gun and run away, I'll be able to hold them back. - Wait for me at the lake. - No! I'll stay with you. Let them shoot. They'll soon run out of ammo. Stop! Don't waste your bullets. She's my daughter, leave her to me. No, I haven't run out of ammo. I still have one bullet left, dad. I'll wait for you, come here... I kept it apart just for you. Come on, come and get me! Why don't you get closer? Are you afraid? I'm sorry, Belle... I didn't know he was your father. If you didn't get there first, I would've killed him myself. He wasn't my father anymore. Let's clear you debt. You owe me something, don't you? Don't you remember? Can I have it back? What are you doing?! Give me your rifle, too. Now, honey, you'll know what it feels like for one of us to remain unarmed. Just like you left me. Leave me alone. - Let me go. - I knew you'd come. I was waiting for you... He seemed like a different person, Cole, my friend. I don't know why he reminded me of my father. There was something different about his eyes, something evil, savage... He grabbed me, threw me on the ground like a beast and tried to undress me. That was when Jessica killed him. I felt his body get heavier on top of mine. Too heavy, I was suffocating under that weight, I couldn't free myself. Jessica thought her debt was payed, I killed for her, now she killed for me. Not knowing that she just killed the only friend I had, The only man that I, despite everything, could've eventually loved. Now you know all the truth about Belle Starr. My bounty grew to five thousand because of people I didn't kill. My name struck fear, I was "the Cruel Belle Starr." When you reach that point, there's no turning back, you know that. I had to keep killing in order to defend myself. And I became the one everyone thought I was. Our stories are all alike. If you weren't you, and I wasn't myself, who knows... We could've lived a different life, together... What a shame... You and me... Are built the same way, maybe that's why... Why I like you, more than any other woman... Coffee? Let's talk about business now. I have a sting in mind, the Special Western Union. The Special? The jewelry cargo from Saint Louis? Everyone that tried, ended up with an ugly outcome, you know that. A million dollars in jewels... I have a plan, but I need a woman. Do you want to join my crew? Me, working for you? Belle Starr doesn't work for anyone. Don't go thinking I'll accept it just because of what happened between us. I can pull that heist myself, why don't you work for me, instead? You're dreaming out loud, dear. You don't understand. I thought you were clever, those that don't work for me, are my enemies. Steady, now. Not bad. Goodbye, Belle Starr. Oh, one more thing. Don't let me see you around these parts. No one has ever me orders. That wasn't an order, it was just... An advice. Goodbye... - What did he want? - Jessica. Pack everything up, we must leave immediately. I must hire a few gunmen. It's time we give a good-earned lesson to Larry Blackie. This one time, I can't seem to understand you. Why is that? Those men, Belle. You shouldn't have spoken to men like Brothers Whitman and the like. They are assassins. You should have never mixed up with that scum. You're right. But I needed to start a posse. I need the best guns, ready for everything. No questions asked. But you've always worked on your own. It's different this time. This heist is far too important, and we need a crew. Because of Blackie, right? Ever since you met him that night, everything changed. Do you love him, Belle? I... I hate him, that bastard. And I want to give him a lesson. Show him, once and for all, who is Belle Starr. Belle! It's that Indian again. - Come on now, what's wrong? - He scares me! - Stay calm, Jessica. - He was on his horse, staring at me! He's been following us for three days now, what could he want from us? - Maybe he's in love with you. - Stop joking around! Alright then, let's see what he wants. I know you're looking for good gunmen, my friends told me about it. If you want me, I'll be ready to follow your command anytime. - Who are you? - My name's Pedro. My mother was Indian, and my country, Mexico. But I can't go back there, there's blood involved... Let me join your crew, you won't regret it. But you'll have to keep an eye on him until we get more acquainted. - Fine, I'll handle it. - You won't regret this. But be aware, and remember... I'm the one in charge here. I won't accept doubt or mistakes, you'll pay a steep price for those. Let's go! Where's Belle? At the lakes. She always goes down there when she wants some time alone. Stop looking at me. Those eyes... It's as if you're always trying to hide something. I thought you understood why I'm look at you. Don't even start with those lies. I don't like them. You're here because Belle needs men the robbery. That's it. Belle Starr, that's all you ever think about. Belle saved me once, I owe my life to her. But you are a woman, and one day you'll meet a man. No, I hate men! They've only hurt me... Bill. Frankie. Gacerro. Jackie. Listen up, this is the route of the caravan. As you know, the Special convoy has a unique escort. Pinkerton personally chooses the men. The best ones, the top shooters, all working for him. The jewels are inside a safe, dynamite-proof. If it's that difficult, then why hit the Special? And, you're asking me? This is the biggest heist ever attempted in the west, and you want it to be easy? Anyway, if anyone wants to back down, then speak up. I'll go through with it because those jewels are worth a million dollars! A million dollars?! I'll follow you to hell, Belle! We're both in. Right, Jack? And you, Gacerro? Speak. What will you do? I'm not backing out. Then, listen up-- Hands up! Bad timing? Can I come in? Look at this reunion... You've scrapped all of the leftovers from the nearest prisons, good job... Don't shoot, fellas. We're all friends in here, right? What are they doing here? They're all working for me now. We're preparing the hit for the Special. Of course, I expected that. What a good girl... You have two days to get out of here, you and your crew. Your last warning... Steady! Don't shoot. We are friends, right? Two days. Just because it's you. I usually don't warn anyone.... See you. I'll hit the Special before you do! Remember that! Now, boys... Let me be clear, if Blackie scares you, you can go ahead and leave! All of you! He'll pay for this, I'm staying. I'll stay, but let's not fool around, you made a mistake by challenging him. He's gonna interfere with the heist. No, not if we strike first. We'll do the job tonight. Everyone keeps attacking the Special while it's on the move, which is why they never succeed. But we will hit them during their evening stop. We'll take the jewels from the bank. guarded by Pinkerton's guards and the sheriff. The most protected place, right here at the bank of Ruth City. Here we are, Belle! - Salutations! - Everything in order, Pedro? - All good, señora. - Good. Perfect timing. Boys, let me introduce you to Benjamin Chesterton, from Pittsburgh. - Did you have a good trip? - I survived, but my back is killing me. - Anyhow, I'm here now. - Come and sit down. Hey, Belle... Who is he? - What does he want? - Be cool, boys, don't be rude now. Mr. Chesterton is not a scoundrel like you bunch. He had the best education, spending most of his youth working at the factory building safe boxes. He knows everything, how to close them, and how to open them. Not to brag, but I'm an expert, which is why they call me "Velvet Fingers." - Take off your hats when he's here. - That's too kind, Ms. Belle. - Are the fingers holding up? - Not too bad. Although recently, I did time in a Chicago prison, A little setback at the workplace... It happens, you know how it is... Well, Chesterton, like I was saying to the boys, I had to modify our plans, we'll go in tonight. - Right here, at Ruth City. - You say it like it was an easy task. Because we'll go in when it's time to collect the jewels. That's when they least expect to get hit... It will not be easy. But for a million dollar, it's well worth it. The idea is simple, open your ears. They expect us at the ground floor, we'll drop from above, from the roofs. If we want to succeed, we must maintain absolute silence. Because under our feet, we'll have the best guns in Chicago. We would get shredded if we raise any suspicions. Meaning, we can't afford even the smallest mistake. If we pull it off, they won't even notice what happened. At Ruth City, the bank is on the main square, right next to the saloon. People return to their homes early, we will wait until the night falls. Next to the old mission, there's a stable. From there, we can reach the main square with the safest route, across the roofs. Stay down. Howdy, Jonathan. How come I don't see anyone walking around tonight? All the convoy people are having dinner. - Those Pinkerton men are ruthless... - Peter, won't you come home? I'm just chatting with Jonathan. I don't like you staying out with all these gunmen around. - You should go home too! - Fine, she's right. - There's something in the air tonight... - Let's go. - See ya', Peter. - Goodbye, Jonathan. It's empty, let's go. Look out! - Let's go have a drink. - I'm coming with you. Just keep your eyes open, and bring me a beer! Go ahead. Wait, don't kill him, there's no need. Frankie! This way. - Remember three years ago? - Sure, they tried to steal the cargo! And we humbly lit up their asses! Poor souls, maybe that's why no one else has tried anymore! Quickly, the jewelry. Traitor... Be quiet! No. Hurry, puta! You scum! Belle, catch! Jessica... Quickly , let's get out, there's nothing you can do... Take the jewels, there. Let's get out of here. Surprise! I didn't realize that, on top of everything else, you were also a traitor. You and your dirty henchmen thought you could kill me, didn't you? You underestimated me, I'm still here. You're still here because my henchmen had the orders not to kill you. Where were you going? Did you want to run away with the jewelry? No... The jewelry is still there. - Go and grab them yourself! - Sorry, I'm not buying it. - Where are the others? What happened? - Go see inside. It's all there. - Jewelry and dead bodies. - All dead? Any means necessary... Now, hand over the jewelry. I told you, I don't have them! We put the cards on the table and he said to leave the bottle. Wait a minute, what is that? It's blood! It's coming from upstairs! - That's where the jewelry is! - Something went down, give the alarm! Watch out! - Did you hide it? - Yes, in the emergency hideaway. We're trapped. Come on, let's hurry up! Look! On the roof! Surrender! - I'll shoot from the other side. - Alright. Do you know why Mr. Pinkerton chose us personally, my friend? Because we hate people like you. The free and strong sons of the South. Ever since the war began we've hated you all. But, we're escorting the Special, And the St. Louis jewelers only care about their own jewels. Now, tell us where you hid them... And we'll stop having fun with you. It's obvious that sooner or later you will speak. Look at this pretty toolset... Poor Chesterton, "Velvet Fingers." He was a real professional, an artist in his own right. It's strange to see him get mixed up with lowlife scum like you... Oh, what a pity. He crashed into the ground like a chick from it's nest. He didn't have thick skin, like yours... Well, then... Where did you hide the jewelry? Come on... tell me... Tell me, Blackie! You think you're good, eh? Resisting the blows, the whips... Don't tell me you're one of those that can't feel pain anymore. It's rare, but it happens sometimes... They told me there was one like that, at Middletown. He lost his sensitivity. He couldn't feel pain anymore. It would be a shame, wouldn't it? Let's find out. Oh! You feel it, don't you? Did you take the jewels out of town, or are they still here?! Speak... How stubborn. I think it's because you don't know me. Does the wound sting? Poor guy, he still has the bullet inside... A knife, Frankie? It's... It's dangerous, it can get infected. Take it out, Frankie. It's not healthy to have bullets in you. Do you like Chopin? It's so sweet, so spiritual... Men like you around these parts don't appreciate the noble arts. Enough, I'm getting tired. You don't wanna see me irritated. Now... Where are the jewels?! Speak! Pig. If you keep pushing me, I'll beat you until you beg me to kill you. But I warn you, a quick death is a reward, and you'll have to earn it. Hey, Frankie, pour some whiskey on his wounds. It's cold in here. With a small fire, I'm sure we'll all be warm and cozy. Stop! Do not move. Put your hands up. Don't move, you bastards! One wrong move, and you're dead. Come here. And hurry up! What a pleasant surprise! So, Blackie wasn't alone, He had a friend up there, in the roof. If I'm not mistaken, Madam Belle Starr. Larry Blackie and Belle Starr, together. Who would've seen that coming-- That's enough, hand over your guns. You do know my men surround this house. If you shoot, they'll rush inside and you won't get out alive. Frankie! Don't you worry about my skin. Instead, try thinking of saving your own. Get him down, quickly. Quickly! Move, let's go. Be careful now... - Now, drop the knife. - What will you do? It's up to you, save your life and take the jewelry, or get shot in the head. - What you want? - We'll both leave this place. You'll come with us, and you'll order your men not to shoot. We only need half an hour. And if--... And if one of them doesn't follow my orders? It would be a real shame, for you. How will I know you won't just kill me anyways? You have Belle Starr’s word. - Now, make a choice. - But-- Do you have the jewels? First ask your men to unload their weapons. And display all of the, right in front of me. Jack, ask everyone to unload their weapons! For what? Do not ask? He said to unload. - Is there anyone else in here? - The saloon girls, at the bar. Tell me to leave. Get out of here, girls. And shut up! Go, go! - He's really a gentleman, isn't he? - Yes. I really did. - Swear to me. - Clear. Here are your jewels! Steady... You can grab them, after we get far from here. Now, give him a hand! Bastard! Don't waste time! We need to hurry. Take it. No tricks. Ask your men to drop their weapons and stand still! I'll take care of that. Drop your weapons! Do not move! Throw your guns on the ground! Come on, help him. Let us pass through! Stay out of it. Make way! Remember, half an hour, I have your word. - Alright... - Let's go! Stop right there! Let them go... I gave her my word of honor... The jewels are safe. That's enough, I'm fine now. You saved my life, you took care of my recovery, I must thank you... You did a good job. You can feel satisfied now, Belle Starr... But I warn you, I don't like to lose. Don't think that this is over just because you've won... No... I know... With you, I always lose... Even when I win. Now, go. Go away! Will it be always this way, between us? Goodbye. Hey, Belle Starr! Don't you think the story ends here! See you at the next poker game.
