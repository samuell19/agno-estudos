( theme music playing ) ( piano music playing ) DID YOU HEAR WHAT I WAS PLAYING, LANE? I DIDN'T THINK IT POLITE TO LISTEN, SIR. I'M SORRY FOR THAT-- FOR YOUR SAKE. I DON'T PLAY ACCURATELY. ANYONE CAN PLAY ACCURATELY. BUT I PLAY WITH WONDERFUL EXPRESSION. AS FAR AS THE PIANO IS CONCERNED, SENTIMENT IS MY FORTE. - I KEEP SCIENCE FOR LIFE. - Lane: YES, SIR. AND SPEAKING OF THE SCIENCE OF LIFE, HAVE YOU GOT THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES CUT FOR LADY BRACKNELL? - YES, SIR. - AH! BY THE WAY... LANE, I SEE FROM YOUR BOOK THAT ON THURSDAY NIGHT, WHEN LORD SHOREMAN AND MR. WORTHING WERE DINING WITH ME, EIGHT BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE ARE ENTERED AS HAVING BEEN CONSUMED. YES, SIR. EIGHT BOTTLES AND A PINT. WHY IS IT THAT AT A BACHELOR'S ESTABLISHMENT THE SERVANTS INVARIABLY DRINK THE CHAMPAGNE? I ASK MERELY FOR INFORMATION. I ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE WINE, SIR. I'VE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT IN MARRIED HOUSEHOLDS THE CHAMPAGNE IS RARELY OF A FIRST-RATE BRAND. GOOD HEAVENS! IS MARRIED LIFE SO DEMORALIZING AS THAT? I BELIEVE IT IS A VERY PLEASANT STATE, SIR. I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF IT MYSELF UP TO THE PRESENT. I'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED ONCE. THAT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN MYSELF AND A YOUNG PERSON. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M MUCH INTERESTED IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE, LANE. NO, SIR. IT IS NOT A VERY INTERESTING SUBJECT. - I NEVER THINK OF IT MYSELF. - VERY NATURAL, I'M SURE. - THAT WILL DO, LANE, THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, SIR. LANE'S VIEWS ON MARRIAGE SEEM SOMEWHAT LAX. REALLY, IF THE LOWER ORDERS DON'T SET US A GOOD EXAMPLE, WHAT ON EARTH IS THE USE OF THEM? THEY SEEM AS A CLASS TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. - MR. ERNEST WORTHING. - HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR ERNEST? - WHAT BRINGS YOU UP TO TOWN? - PLEASURE. PLEASURE. WHAT ELSE SHOULD BRING ONE ANYWHERE? EATING AS USUAL, I SEE, ALGY. I BELIEVE IT IS CUSTOMARY IN GOOD SOCIETY TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT AT 5:00. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SINCE LAST THURSDAY? - IN THE COUNTRY. - WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU DO THERE? WHEN ONE IS IN TOWN, ONE AMUSES ONESELF. WHEN ONE IS IN THE COUNTRY, ONE AMUSES OTHER PEOPLE. - IT IS EXCESSIVELY BORING. - WHO ARE THE PEOPLE YOU AMUSE? OH, NEIGHBORS. - NEIGHBORS. - GOT NICE NEIGHBORS IN YOUR PART OF SHROPSHIRE? PERFECTLY HORRID. NEVER SPEAK TO ONE OF THEM. HOW IMMENSELY YOU MUST AMUSE THEM. BY THE WAY, SHROPSHIRE IS YOUR COUNTY, IS IS NOT? - EH? SHROPSHIRE? - MMM. OH-- YES, OF COURSE. HELLO! WHY ALL THESE CUPS? WHY CUCUMBER SANDWICHES? WHY A RECKLESS EXTRAVAGANCE IN ONE SO YOUNG? - WHO'S COMING TO TEA? - MERELY AUNT AUGUSTA AND GWENDOLEN. - HOW PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL. - THAT IS ALL VERY WELL. I'M AFRAID AUNT AUGUSTA WON'T QUITE APPROVE OF YOUR BEING HERE. - MAY I ASK WHY? - MY DEAR FELLOW, THE WAY YOU FLIRT WITH GWENDOLEN IS PERFECTLY DISGRACEFUL. IT IS ALMOST AS BAD AS THE WAY GWENDOLEN FLIRTS WITH YOU. I AM IN LOVE WITH GWENDOLEN. I HAVE COME TO TOWN EXPRESSLY TO PROPOSE TO HER. I THOUGHT YOU'D COME UP FOR PLEASURE? - I CALL THAT BUSINESS. - HOW UTTERLY UNROMANTIC YOU ARE. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ROMANTIC IN PROPOSING. IT IS VERY ROMANTIC TO BE IN LOVE. BUT THERE IS NOTHING ROMANTIC AT ALL ABOUT A DEFINITE PROPOSAL. ONE MAY BE ACCEPTED. ONE USUALLY IS, I BELIEVE. THEN THE EXCITEMENT IS ALL OVER. THE VERY ESSENCE OF ROMANCE IS UNCERTAINTY. IF I GET MARRIED, I'LL CERTAINLY TRY TO FORGET THE FACT. I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, ALGY. THE DIVORCE COURT WAS SPECIALLY INVENTED FOR PEOPLE WHOSE MEMORIES ARE SO CURIOUSLY CONSTITUTED. THERE'S NO USE SPECULATING ON THAT SUBJECT. DIVORCES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN. PLEASE! DON'T TOUCH THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES. THEY ARE ORDERED SPECIALLY FOR AUNT AUGUSTA. YOU'VE BEEN EATING THEM ALL THE TIME. THAT IS A DIFFERENT MATTER. SHE IS MY AUNT. HAVE SOME BREAD AND BUTTER. THE BREAD AND BUTTER IS FOR GWENDOLEN. GWENDOLEN IS DEVOTED TO BREAD AND BUTTER. AND VERY GOOD BREAD AND BUTTER IT IS, TOO. YOU NEED NOT EAT IT AS IF YOU WERE GOING TO EAT IT ALL. YOU BEHAVE AS IF YOU WERE MARRIED ALREADY. YOU ARE NOT MARRIED TO HER ALREADY. I DON'T THINK YOU EVER WILL BE. WHY ON EARTH DO YOU SAY THAT? IN THE FIRST PLACE, GIRLS NEVER MARRY THE MEN THEY FLIRT WITH. - GIRLS DON'T THINK IT RIGHT. - THAT IS NONSENSE! IT ISN'T! IT'S A GREAT TRUTH. IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF BACHELORS ONE SEES ALL OVER THE PLACE. IN THE SECOND PLACE... I DON'T GIVE MY CONSENT. - YOUR CONSENT? - GWENDOLEN IS MY FIRST COUSIN. BEFORE I ALLOW YOU TO MARRY HER, ( distant bell rings ) YOU WILL HAVE TO CLEAR UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF CECILY. CECILY? WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALGY, BY CECILY?! I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY BY THE NAME OF CECILY! BRING ME THAT CIGARETTE CASE MR. WORTHING LEFT IN THE SMOKING ROOM THE LAST TIME HE DINED HERE. YES, SIR. YOU MEAN YOU'VE HAD MY CIGARETTE CASE ALL THIS TIME? I WISH TO GOODNESS YOU HAD LET ME KNOW. I'VE BEEN WRITING FRANTIC LETTERS TO SCOTLAND YARD ABOUT IT. I WAS VERY NEARLY OFFERING A LARGE REWARD. I WISH YOU WOULD OFFER ONE. I HAPPEN TO BE MORE THAN USUALLY HARD UP. IT'S NO GOOD OFFERING A REWARD, NOW THE THING IS FOUND! THAT IS RATHER MEAN OF YOU, ERNEST, I MUST SAY. HOWEVER... IT MAKES NO MATTER. NOW THAT I LOOK AT THE INSCRIPTION INSIDE, I FIND THAT THE THING ISN'T YOURS, AFTER ALL. OF COURSE IT'S MINE. YOU'VE SEEN ME WITH IT A HUNDRED TIMES. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO READ WHAT IS WRITTEN INSIDE. IT IS VERY UNGENTLEMANLY TO READ A PRIVATE CIGARETTE CASE. IT'S ABSURD TO MAKE A RULE ABOUT WHAT ONE SHOULD READ AND WHAT ONE SHOULDN'T. MORE THAN HALF OF MODERN CULTURE DEPENDS ON WHAT ONE SHOULDN'T READ. I AM AWARE OF THE FACT. I DON'T PROPOSE TO DISCUSS MODERN CULTURE. IT ISN'T THE SORT OF THING ONE SHOULD TALK OF IN PRIVATE. - I SIMPLY WANT MY CIGARETTE CASE. - THIS ISN'T YOUR CASE. THIS CASE IS A PRESENT FROM SOMEONE OF THE NAME OF CECILY. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE OF THAT NAME. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, CECILY HAPPENS TO BE MY AUNT. - YOUR AUNT! - YES, CHARMING OLD LADY SHE IS, TOO. LIVES AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS. JUST GIVE IT BACK, ALGY. WHY DOES SHE CALL HERSELF "LITTLE CECILY" IF SHE IS YOUR AUNT AND LIVES AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS? "FROM LITTLE CECILY WITH HER FONDEST LOVE." WHAT ON EARTH IS THERE IN THAT? SOME AUNTS ARE TALL, SOME AUNTS ARE NOT. THAT IS A MATTER THAT AN AUNT MAY BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF. YOU THINK THAT EVERY AUNT SHOULD BE LIKE YOUR AUNT. THAT IS ABSURD. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, GIVE ME MY CIGARETTE CASE. BUT WHY DOES YOUR AUNT CALL YOU "UNCLE"? "FROM LITTLE CECILY, WITH HER FONDEST LOVE TO HER DEAR UNCLE JACK." THERE IS NO OBJECTION, TO AN AUNT BEING A SMALL AUNT, BUT WHY AN AUNT, NO MATTER WHAT HER SIZE, SHOULD CALL HER NEPHEW HER UNCLE, I CAN'T MAKE OUT. BESIDES, YOUR NAME ISN'T "JACK" AT ALL. IT'S ERNEST. IT ISN'T ERNEST. IT'S JACK. YOU'VE ALWAYS TOLD ME IT WAS ERNEST. I'VE INTRODUCED YOU TO EVERYONE AS ERNEST. YOU ANSWER TO THE NAME OF ERNEST. YOU LOOK AS IF YOUR NAME WAS ERNEST. YOU ARE THE MOST EARNEST-LOOKING PERSON I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE. IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD SAYING THAT YOUR NAME ISN'T ERNEST. IT'S ON YOUR CARDS. HERE IS ONE OF THEM. "MR. ERNEST WORTHING, B.4, THE ALBANY." I'LL KEEP THIS AS A PROOF THAT YOUR NAME IS ERNEST IF YOU ATTEMPT TO DENY IT TO ME OR GWENDOLEN OR ANYONE ELSE. MY NAME IS ERNEST IN TOWN AND JACK IN THE COUNTRY. THE CIGARETTE CASE WAS GIVEN TO ME IN THE COUNTRY. BUT THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR SMALL AUNT CECILY, WHO LIVES AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS, CALLS YOU "HER DEAR UNCLE." COME, OLD BOY. YOU'D MUCH BETTER HAVE THE THING OUT AT ONCE. I MAY MENTION THAT I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED YOU OF BEING A CONFIRMED AND SECRET BUNBURYIST, - I AM SURE OF IT NOW. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A "BUNBURYIST"? I'LL REVEAL TO YOU THE MEANING OF THAT INCOMPARABLE EXPRESSION AS SOON AS YOU ARE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM ME WHY YOU ARE ERNEST IN TOWN AND JACK IN THE COUNTRY. - PRODUCE MY CIGARETTE CASE FIRST. - HERE IT IS. PRODUCE YOUR EXPLANATION, AND PRAY MAKE IT IMPROBABLE. THERE IS NOTHING IMPROBABLE ABOUT MY EXPLANATION AT ALL. IN FACT, IT'S PERFECTLY ORDINARY. MR. THOMAS CARDEW, WHO ADOPTED ME WHEN I WAS A BOY, MADE ME IN HIS WILL GUARDIAN TO HIS GRANDDAUGHTER, MISS CECILY CARDEW. CECILY, WHO ADDRESSES ME AS HER UNCLE, FROM MOTIVES OF RESPECT YOU COULD NOT APPRECIATE, LIVES AT MY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY UNDER THE CHARGE OF HER ADMIRABLE GOVERNESS, MISS PRISM. WHERE IS THAT PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, BY THE WAY? THAT IS NOTHING TO YOU. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE INVITED. I MAY TELL YOU THAT THE PLACE IS NOT IN SHROPSHIRE. I SUSPECTED THAT, MY DEAR FELLOW. I HAVE BUNBURYED ALL OVER SHROPSHIRE ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS. BUT GO ON. WHY ARE YOU ERNEST IN TOWN AND JACK IN THE COUNTRY? ALGY, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND MY REAL MOTIVES. YOU ARE HARDLY SERIOUS ENOUGH. WHEN PLACED IN THE POSITION OF GUARDIAN, ONE HAS TO ADOPT A VERY HIGH MORAL TONE ON ALL SUBJECTS. IT IS ONE'S DUTY TO DO SO. AS A HIGH MORAL TONE CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONDUCE MUCH TO ONE'S HEALTH OR ONE'S HAPPINESS, IN ORDER TO GET UP TO TOWN, I HAVE ALWAYS PRETENDED TO HAVE A YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE NAME OF ERNEST, WHO LIVES IN THE ALBANY AND GETS INTO THE MOST DREADFUL SCRAPES. THAT, MY DEAR YOUNG ALGY, IS THE WHOLE TRUTH, PURE AND SIMPLE. THE TRUTH IS RARELY PURE AND NEVER SIMPLE. MODERN LIFE WOULD BE VERY TEDIOUS IF IT WERE EITHER, AND MODERN LITERATURE A COMPLETE IMPOSSIBILITY. THAT WOULDN'T BE AT ALL A BAD THING. LITERARY CRITICISM IS NOT YOUR FORTE. DON'T TRY IT. LEAVE THAT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN AT UNIVERSITY. THEY DO IT SO WELL IN THE DAILY PAPERS. WHAT YOU REALLY ARE IS A BUNBURYIST. I WAS RIGHT IN SAYING YOU WERE A BUNBURYIST. YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED BUNBURYISTS I KNOW. WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN? YOU HAVE INVENTED A VERY USEFUL YOUNGER BROTHER CALLED "ERNEST" THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO COME TO TOWN AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE. I HAVE INVENTED AN INVALUABLE PERMANENT INVALID CALLED "BUNBURY," THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY WHENEVER I CHOOSE. BUNBURY IS PERFECTLY INVALUABLE. IF IT WASN'T FOR BUNBURY'S EXTRAORDINARILY BAD HEALTH, FOR INSTANCE, I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DINE WITH YOU TONIGHT AT THE SAVOY, FOR I HAVE REALLY BEEN ENGAGED TO AUNT AUGUSTA FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU TO DINE WITH ME ANYWHERE TONIGHT. I KNOW. YOU ARE ABSURDLY CARELESS ABOUT SENDING OUT INVITATIONS. IT IS FOOLISH OF YOU. NOTHING ANNOYS PEOPLE SO MUCH AS NOT RECEIVING INVITATIONS. I CAN'T DINE AT THE SAVOY. I OWE THEM ABOUT ?700. WHY DON'T YOU PAY THEM? YOU'VE GOT HEAPS OF MONEY. BUT ERNEST HASN'T. ERNEST IS THE SORT OF CHAP THAT NEVER PAYS A BILL. THEN LET US DINE AT WILLIS'. YOU HAD BETTER DINE WITH YOUR AUNT AUGUSTA. I HAVEN'T THE INTENTION OF DOING ANYTHING OF THE KIND. I DINED THERE ON MONDAY. ONCE A WEEK IS ENOUGH TO DINE WITH ONE'S OWN RELATIONS. I KNOW WHOM SHE WILL PLACE ME NEXT TO TONIGHT. SHE WILL PLACE ME NEXT TO MARY FARQUHAR, WHO ALWAYS FLIRTS WITH HER OWN HUSBAND ACROSS THE DINNER TABLE. THAT IS NOT VERY PLEASANT. IT IS NOT EVEN DECENT... AND THAT SORT OF THING IS ENORMOUSLY ON THE INCREASE. THE AMOUNT OF WOMEN WHO FLIRT WITH THEIR OWN HUSBANDS IS PERFECTLY SCANDALOUS. IT LOOKS SO BAD. IT IS SIMPLY WASHING ONE'S CLEAN LINEN IN PUBLIC. BESIDES, NOW THAT I KNOW YOU TO BE A CONFIRMED BUNBURYIST, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BUNBURYING. I WANT TO TELL YOU THE RULES. I AM NOT A BUNBURYIST AT ALL. IF GWENDOLEN ACCEPTS ME, I AM GOING TO KILL MY BROTHER. IN FACT, I'LL KILL HIM IN ANY CASE. CECILY IS TOO INTERESTED IN HIM. IT IS RATHER A BORE. I AM GOING TO GET RID OF ERNEST. I ADVISE YOU TO DO THE SAME WITH MISTER-- WITH YOUR INVALID FRIEND WHO HAS THE ABSURD NAME. NOTHING WILL INDUCE ME TO PART WITH BUNBURY. IF YOU GET MARRIED, WHICH SEEMS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC, YOU WILL BE VERY GLAD TO KNOW BUNBURY. A MAN WHO MARRIES WITHOUT KNOWING BUNBURY HAS A VERY TEDIOUS TIME OF IT. THAT IS NONSENSE. IF I MARRY A CHARMING GIRL LIKE GWENDOLEN, AND SHE IS THE ONLY GIRL I SAW IN MY LIFE THAT I WOULD MARRY, I CERTAINLY WON'T WANT TO KNOW BUNBURY. YOUR WIFE WILL. YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT IN MARRIED LIFE THREE IS COMPANY AND TWO IS NONE. - ( doorbell ringing ) - THAT MUST BE AUNT AUGUST. ONLY RELATIVES OR CREDITORS EVER RING IN THAT WAGNERIAN MANNER. IF I GET HER OUT OF THE WAY FOR 10 MINUTES, SO YOU CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROPOSING TO GWENDOLEN, - MAY I DINE WITH YOU AT WILLIS' TONIGHT? - I SUPPOSE, IF YOU WANT TO. BUT YOU MUST BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. I HATE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT MEALS. IT IS SO SHALLOW OF THEM. LADY BRACKNELL AND MISS FAIRFAX. GOOD AFTERNOON, ALGERNON. I HOPE YOU ARE BEHAVING VERY WELL. - I AM FEELING VERY WELL, AUNT AUGUSTA. - THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING. IN FACT, THE TWO THINGS RARELY GO TOGETHER. Algernon: DEAR ME, YOU ARE SMART. I AM ALWAYS SMART. AM I NOT, MR. WORTHING? YOU'RE QUITE PERFECT, MISS FAIRFAX. I HOPE I AM NOT THAT. IT WOULD LEAVE ME NO ROOM FOR DEVELOPMENTS, AND I INTEND TO DEVELOP IN MANY DIRECTIONS. I'M SORRY IF WE ARE A LITTLE LATE, ALGERNON, BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO CALL ON DEAR LADY HARBURY. I HADN'T BEEN THERE SINCE HER POOR HUSBAND'S DEATH. I NEVER SAW A WOMAN SO ALTERED, SHE LOOKS QUITE 20 YEARS YOUNGER. NOW I'LL HAVE A CUP OF TEA, AND ONE OF THOSE NICE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES YOU PROMISED ME. CERTAINLY, AUNT AUGUSTA. GWENDOLEN... WON'T YOU COME AND SIT HERE? THANKS, MAMMA, I'M QUITE COMFORTABLE WHERE I AM. GOOD HEAVENS! LANE, WHY ARE THERE NO CUCUMBER SANDWICHES? I ORDERED THEM SPECIALLY. THERE WERE NO CUCUMBERS IN THE MARKET THIS MORNING, SIR. - I WENT DOWN TWICE. - NO CUCUMBERS? NO, SIR. NOT EVEN FOR READY MONEY. - THAT WILL DO. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, SIR. I AM GREATLY DISTRESSED ABOUT THERE BEING NO CUCUMBERS, NOT EVEN FOR READY MONEY. IT MAKES NO MATTER, ALGERNON. I HAD CRUMPETS WITH LADY HARBURY, WHO SEEMS TO ME TO BE LIVING ENTIRELY FOR PLEASURE NOW. I HEAR HER HAIR HAS TURNED QUITE GOLD FROM GRIEF. IT CERTAINLY HAS CHANGED ITS COLOR. FROM WHAT CAUSE, I, OF COURSE, CANNOT SAY. THANK YOU. I'VE A TREAT FOR YOU TONIGHT, ALGERNON. I AM GOING TO SEND YOU DOWN WITH MARY FARQUHAR. SUCH A NICE WOMAN, AND SO ATTENTIVE TO HER HUSBAND. IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO WATCH THEM. I AM AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE UP THE PLEASURE OF DINING WITH YOU TONIGHT. I HOPE NOT, ALGERNON. IT WOULD PUT MY TABLE COMPLETELY OUT. YOUR POOR UNCLE WOULD HAVE TO DINE UPSTAIRS. FORTUNATELY HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO THAT. IT IS A GREAT BORE, AND A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT I HAVE JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM TO SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND BUNBURY IS VERY ILL AGAIN. THEY SEEM TO THINK I SHOULD BE WITH HIM. IT IS VERY STRANGE. THIS MR. BUNBURY SEEMS TO SUFFER FROM CURIOUSLY BAD HEALTH. YES, POOR BUNBURY IS A DREADFUL INVALID. I MUST SAY, ALGERNON, IT IS HIGH TIME MR. BUNBURY MADE UP HIS MIND WHETHER HE WAS TO LIVE OR TO DIE. THIS SHILLY-SHALLYING WITH THE QUESTION IS ABSURD. NOR DO I APPROVE OF THE MODERN SYMPATHY WITH INVALIDS. I CONSIDER IT MORBID. ILLNESS OF ANY KIND IS HARDLY TO BE ENCOURAGED IN OTHERS. HEALTH IS THE PRIMARY DUTY OF LIFE. I AM ALWAYS TELLING THAT TO YOUR POOR UNCLE, BUT HE NEVER SEEMS TO TAKE ANY NOTICE... AS FAR AS ANY IMPROVEMENT IN HIS AILMENT GOES. I SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD ASK MR. BUNBURY FROM ME, TO BE KIND ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE A RELAPSE ON SATURDAY, FOR I RELY ON YOU TO ARRANGE MY MUSIC FOR ME. IT IS MY LAST RECEPTION, AND ONE WANTS SOMETHING THAT WILL ENCOURAGE CONVERSATION, PARTICULARLY AT THE END OF THE SEASON WHEN EVERYONE HAS PRACTICALLY SAID WHATEVER THEY HAD TO SAY, WHICH, IN MOST CASES, WAS PROBABLY NOT MUCH. I'LL SPEAK TO BUNBURY, AUNT AUGUSTA, IF HE IS STILL CONSCIOUS, AND I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT BY SATURDAY. OF COURSE, THE MUSIC IS A GREAT DIFFICULTY. IF ONE PLAYS GOOD MUSIC, PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN, AND IF ONE PLAYS BAD MUSIC, PEOPLE DON'T TALK. BUT I'LL RUN OVER THE PROGRAM I'VE DRAWN OUT FOR YOU, IF YOU WILL KINDLY COME INTO THE NEXT ROOM FOR A MOMENT? THANK YOU, ALGERNON. IT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU. I'M SURE THE PROGRAM WILL BE DELIGHTFUL AFTER A FEW EXPURGATIONS. FRENCH SONGS I CANNOT POSSIBLY ALLOW. PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO THINK THAT THEY ARE IMPROPER, AND EITHER LOOK SHOCKED, WHICH IS VULGAR, OR LAUGH, WHICH IS WORSE. BUT GERMAN SOUNDS A THOROUGHLY RESPECTABLE LANGUAGE, AND INDEED, I BELIEVE IS SO. GWENDOLEN, YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME. CERTAINLY, MAMMA. CHARMING DAY IT HAS BEEN, MISS FAIRFAX. PRAY DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THE WEATHER, MR. WORTHING. WHENEVER PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT THE WEATHER, I FEEL QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY MEAN SOMETHING ELSE. - AND THAT MAKES ME SO NERVOUS. - I DO MEAN SOMETHING ELSE. I THOUGHT SO. IN FACT, I AM NEVER WRONG. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ALLOWED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LADY BRACKNELL'S TEMPORARY ABSENCE-- I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO DO SO. MAMMA HAS A WAY OF COMING BACK SUDDENLY INTO A ROOM THAT I HAVE OFTEN HAD TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT. MISS FAIRFAX, EVER SINCE I MET YOU I HAVE ADMIRED YOU MORE THAN ANY GIRL... I HAVE EVER MET SINCE... I MET YOU. YES, I AM QUITE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT. AND I OFTEN WISH THAT IN PUBLIC AT ANY RATE-- YOU HAD BEEN MORE... DEMONSTRATIVE. FOR ME, YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION. EVEN BEFORE I MET YOU, I WAS FAR FROM INDIFFERENT TO YOU. WE LIVE, AS I HOPE YOU KNOW, MR. WORTHING, IN AN AGE OF IDEALS. THE FACT IS CONSTANTLY BEING MENTIONED IN THE MORE EXPENSIVE MONTHLY MAGAZINES, AND HAS REACHED THE PROVINCIAL PULPITS, I AM TOLD. AND MY IDEAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO LOVE SOMEONE OF THE NAME OF ERNEST. SOMETHING IN THAT NAME INSPIRES ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE. THE MOMENT ALGERNON MENTIONED THAT HE HAD A FRIEND CALLED ERNEST, I KNEW I WAS DESTINED TO LOVE YOU. YOU REALLY LOVE ME, GWENDOLEN? PASSIONATELY! DARLING, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY YOU'VE MADE ME. - MY OWN ERNEST! - YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME IF MY NAME WASN'T ERNEST? BUT YOUR NAME IS ERNEST. I KNOW IT IS. BUT SUPPOSING IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE? YOU REALLY MEAN TO SAY YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME THEN? THAT IS CLEARLY A METAPHYSICAL SPECULATION. LIKE MOST METAPHYSICAL SPECULATIONS, HAS LITTLE REFERENCE TO ACTUAL FACTS OF REAL LIFE AS WE KNOW THEM. TO SPEAK CANDIDLY, DARLING, I DON'T MUCH CARE FOR THE NAME OF ERNEST. - I DON'T THINK THE NAME SUITS ME AT ALL. - IT SUITS YOU PERFECTLY! IT IS A DIVINE NAME. IT HAS A MUSIC OF ITS OWN. IT PRODUCES... VIBRATIONS. REALLY, GWENDOLEN, I MUST SAY, I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER MUCH NICER NAMES. JACK, FOR INSTANCE. A CHARMING NAME. JACK? THERE IS VERY LITTLE MUSIC IN THE NAME OF JACK, IF ANY AT ALL. IT DOES NOT THRILL. IT PRODUCES ABSOLUTELY NO VIBRATIONS. I HAVE KNOWN SEVERAL JACKS. THEY ALL, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WERE MORE THAN USUALLY PLAIN. BESIDES, JACK IS A NOTORIOUS DOMESTICITY FOR JOHN! AND I PITY ANY WOMAN WHO IS MARRIED TO A MAN CALLED JOHN. SHE WOULD PROBABLY NEVER BE ALLOWED TO KNOW THE ENTRANCING PLEASURE OF A SINGLE MOMENT'S SOLITUDE. THE ONLY REALLY SAFE NAME... IS ERNEST. GWENDOLEN, I MUST GET CHRISTENED AT ONCE-- I MEAN, WE MUST GET MARRIED AT ONCE. THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST. MARRIED, MR. WORTHING? WELL SURELY. YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU, YOU LED ME TO BELIEVE, MISS FAIRFAX, YOU WERE NOT ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT TO ME. I ADORE YOU. BUT YOU HAVEN'T PROPOSED TO ME YET. NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID AT ALL ABOUT MARRIAGE. THE SUBJECT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN TOUCHED ON. MAY I PROPOSE TO YOU NOW? I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITY. AND TO SPARE YOU ANY POSSIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, MR. WORTHING, I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU FRANKLY BEFOREHAND I AM FULLY DETERMINED TO ACCEPT YOU. GWENDOLEN! YES, MR. WORTHING, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY TO ME? YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY TO YOU. YES, BUT YOU DON'T SAY IT. GWENDOLEN, WILL YOU MARRY ME? OF COURSE I WILL, DARLING. HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN HOW TO PROPOSE. MY OWN ONE, I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYONE BUT YOU. BUT MEN OFTEN PROPOSE FOR PRACTICE. MY BROTHER GERALD DOES. ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS TELL ME. WHAT WONDERFULLY BLUE EYES YOU HAVE, ERNEST! THEY ARE... QUITE, QUITE BLUE. I HOPE YOU WILL ALWAYS LOOK AT ME JUST LIKE THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE PRESENT. MR. WORTHING! RISE, SIR, FROM THIS SEMI-RECUMBENT POSTURE. IT IS MOST INDECOROUS. MAMMA! I MUST BEG YOU TO RETIRE. THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU. BESIDES, MR. WORTHING HAS NOT QUITE FINISHED YET. FINISHED WHAT, MAY I ASK? I AM ENGAGED TO MR. WORTHING, MAMMA. PARDON ME, YOU ARE NOT ENGAGED TO ANYONE. WHEN YOU DO BECOME ENGAGED TO SOMEONE, I, OR YOUR FATHER, SHOULD HIS HEALTH PERMIT HIM, WILL INFORM YOU OF THE FACT. AN ENGAGEMENT SHOULD COME UPON A YOUNG GIRL AS A SURPRISE, PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT, AS THE CASE MAY BE. IT IS HARDLY A MATTER SHE COULD BE ALLOWED TO ARRANGE FOR HERSELF. AND NOW... I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO PUT TO YOU, MR. WORTHING. WHILE I AM MAKING THESE INQUIRIES, YOU, GWENDOLEN, WILL WAIT FOR ME BELOW IN THE CARRIAGE. - BUT, MAMMA-- - IN THE CARRIAGE, GWENDOLEN! YES, MAMMA. - GWENDOLEN, THE CARRIAGE! - YES, MAMMA. YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT, MR. WORTHING. THANK YOU, LADY BRACKNELL, I PREFER STANDING. I FEEL BOUND TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT DOWN ON MY LIST OF ELIGIBLE YOUNG MEN, ALTHOUGH I HAVE THE SAME LIST AS THE DUCHESS OF BOLTON HAS. WE WORK TOGETHER, IN FACT. HOWEVER... I AM WILLING TO ENTER YOUR NAME, SHOULD YOUR ANSWERS BE WHAT A REALLY AFFECTIONATE MOTHER REQUIRES. DO YOU SMOKE? WELL, YES, I MUST ADMIT I SMOKE. I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT. A MAN SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE AN OCCUPATION OF SOME KIND. THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY IDLE MEN IN LONDON AS IT IS. - HOW OLD ARE YOU? - 29. A VERY GOOD AGE TO BE MARRIED AT. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT A MAN WHO DESIRES TO GET MARRIED SHOULD KNOW EITHER EVERYTHING OR NOTHING. WHICH DO YOU KNOW? I KNOW NOTHING, LADY BRACKNELL. I AM PLEASED TO HEAR IT. I DO NOT APPROVE OF ANYTHING THAT TAMPERS WITH NATURAL IGNORANCE. IGNORANCE IS LIKE A DELICATE, EXOTIC FRUIT-- TOUCH IT, AND THE BLOOM IS GONE. THE WHOLE THEORY OF MODERN EDUCATION IS RADICALLY UNSOUND. FORTUNATELY, IN ENGLAND AT ANY RATE, EDUCATION PRODUCES NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER. IF IT DID, IT WOULD PROVE A SERIOUS DANGER TO THE UPPER CLASSES, AND PROBABLY LEAD TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN GROSVENOR SQUARE. WHAT IS YOUR INCOME? BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR. IN LAND-- OR IN INVESTMENTS? IN INVESTMENTS, CHIEFLY. THAT IS SATISFACTORY. BETWEEN THE DUTIES EXPECTED FROM ONE DURING ONE'S LIFETIME, AND THE DUTIES EXACTED FROM ONE AFTER ONE'S DEATH, LAND HAS CEASED TO BE EITHER A PROFIT OR A PLEASURE. IT GIVES ONE POSITION, AND PREVENTS ONE FROM KEEPING IT UP. THAT'S ALL THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT LAND. I HAVE A COUNTRY HOUSE WITH SOME LAND ATTACHED TO IT. ABOUT 1,500 ACRES, I BELIEVE, BUT I DON'T DEPEND ON THAT FOR REAL INCOME. AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT, THE POACHERS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF IT. A COUNTRY HOUSE! HOW MANY BEDROOMS? WELL, THAT POINT CAN BE CLEARED UP AFTERWARDS. YOU HAVE A TOWN HOUSE, I HOPE? A GIRL WITH A SIMPLE, UNSPOILED NATURE, LIKE GWENDOLEN, COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY. I OWN A HOUSE IN BELGRAVE SQUARE, BUT IT IS LET BY THE YEAR TO LADY BLOXHAM. OF COURSE, I CAN GET IT BACK WHENEVER I LIKE, AT SIX MONTHS' NOTICE. LADY BLOXHAM? I DON'T KNOW HER. SHE GOES ABOUT VERY LITTLE. SHE'S A LADY CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED IN YEARS. NOWADAYS THAT IS NO GUARANTEE OF RESPECTABILITY OF CHARACTER. - WHAT NUMBER BELGRAVE SQUARE? - 149. THE UNFASHIONABLE SIDE. I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING. HOWEVER, THAT COULD EASILY BE ALTERED. - THE FASHION, OR THE SIDE? - BOTH, IF NECESSARY, I PRESUME. WHAT ARE YOUR POLITICS? WELL... I'M AFRAID I REALLY HAVE NONE. I AM A LIBERAL UNIONIST. THEY COUNT AS TORIES. THEY DINE WITH US, OR COME IN THE EVENING, AT ANY RATE. NOW... TO MINOR MATTERS. ARE YOUR PARENTS LIVING? I HAVE LOST BOTH MY PARENTS. TO LOSE ONE PARENT, MR. WORTHING, MIGHT BE REGARDED AS A MISFORTUNE. TO LOSE BOTH LOOKS LIKE CARELESSNESS. WHO WAS YOUR FATHER? HE WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF SOME WEALTH. WAS HE BORN IN WHAT THE RADICAL PAPERS CALL THE PURPLE OF COMMERCE, OR DID HE RISE FROM THE RANKS OF THE ARISTOCRACY? I'M AFRAID I REALLY DON'T KNOW. THE FACT IS, LADY BRACKNELL, I SAID I HAD LOST MY PARENTS. IT WOULD BE NEARER THE TRUTH TO SAY THAT MY PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE LOST ME. I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHO I AM BY BIRTH. I WAS... WELL, I WAS FOUND. FOUND? YES, THE LATE MR. THOMAS CARDEW, AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF A CHARITABLE AND KINDLY DISPOSITION, FOUND ME AND GAVE ME THE NAME OF WORTHING, BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A FIRST-CLASS TICKET FOR WORTHING IN HIS POCKET AT THE TIME. WORTHING IS A PLACE IN SUSSEX. IT IS A SEASIDE RESORT. AND WHERE DID THE CHARITABLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A FIRST-CLASS TICKET FOR THIS SEASIDE RESORT FIND YOU? IN A HANDBAG. A HANDBAG? YES, I WAS IN A HANDBAG, LADY BRACKNELL. A SOMEWHAT... LARGE, BLACK LEATHER HANDBAG, WITH HANDLES TO IT. A VERY ORDINARY HANDBAG, IN FACT. IN WHAT LOCALITY DID THIS MR. JAMES, OR THOMAS CARDEW COME ACROSS THIS "ORDINARY HANDBAG"? IN THE CLOAKROOM AT VICTORIA STATION. IT WAS GIVEN TO HIM IN MISTAKE FOR HIS OWN. - THE CLOAKROOM AT VICTORIA STATION? - YES. THE BRIGHTON LINE. THE LINE IS IMMATERIAL. MR. WORTHING, I AM BEWILDERED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST TOLD ME. TO BE BORN, OR AT ANY RATE BRED, IN A HANDBAG, WHETHER IT HAD HANDLES OR NOT, SEEMS TO TO ME TO DISPLAY A CONTEMPT FOR THE ORDINARY DECENCIES OF FAMILY LIFE THAT REMINDS ONE OF THE WORSE EXCESSES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. I PRESUME YOU KNOW WHAT THAT UNFORTUNATE MOVEMENT LED TO? AS TO THE PARTICULAR LOCALITY IN WHICH THE HANDBAG WAS FOUND, A CLOAKROOM AT A RAILWAY STATION MIGHT SERVE TO CONCEAL A SOCIAL INDISCRETION-- INDEED, HAS PROBABLY BEEN USED FOR THAT PURPOSE MORE THAN ONCE, BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE REGARDED AS AN ASSURED BASIS FOR A RECOGNIZED POSITION IN GOOD SOCIETY. MAY I ASK YOU THEN WHAT YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TO DO? I NEED HARDLY SAY I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO ENSURE GWENDOLEN'S HAPPINESS. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE YOU, MR. WORTHING, TO TRY AND ACQUIRE SOME RELATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND TO MAKE A DEFINITE EFFORT TO PRODUCE AT ANY RATE ONE PARENT OF EITHER SEX, BEFORE THE SEASON IS QUITE OVER. I DON'T SEE HOW I COULD POSSIBLY MANAGE TO DO THAT. I CAN PRODUCE THE HANDBAG AT ANY MOMENT. IT IS IN MY DRESSING ROOM AT HOME. I REALLY THINK THAT SHOULD SATISFY YOU, LADY BRACKNELL. ME, SIR?! WHAT HAS IT TO DO WITH ME? YOU CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THAT I AND LORD BRACKNELL WOULD DREAM OF ALLOWING OUR ONLY DAUGHTER, A GIRL BROUGHT UP WITH THE UTMOST CARE, TO MARRY INTO A CLOAKROOM AND FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH A PARCEL? KINDLY OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME, SIR. YOU WILL, OF COURSE, UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THE FUTURE THERE IS TO BE NO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX. GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR. GOOD DAY, LADY BRACKNELL. ( piano playing "Wedding March" ) FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, ALGY! DON'T PLAY THAT GHASTLY TUNE! - HOW IDIOTIC YOU ARE. - ( music stops ) DIDN'T IT GO OFF ALL RIGHT, OLD BOY? YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT GWENDOLEN REFUSED YOU? IT IS A WAY SHE HAS. SHE IS ALWAYS REFUSING PEOPLE. I THINK IT IS MOST ILL-NATURED OF HER. GWENDOLEN IS RIGHT AS A TRIVET. AS FAR AS SHE IS CONCERNED, WE ARE ENGAGED. HER MOTHER IS PERFECTLY UNBEARABLE. I'VE NEVER MET SUCH A GORGON! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A GORGON IS LIKE, BUT I AM QUITE SURE LADY BRACKNELL IS ONE. IN ANY CASE, SHE IS A MONSTER, WITHOUT BEING A MYTH, WHICH IS RATHER UNFAIR-- I BEG YOUR PARDON, ALGY, I SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT YOUR AUNT THAT WAY BEFORE YOU. DEAR BOY, I LOVE HEARING MY RELATIONS ABUSED. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME PUT UP WITH THEM. RELATIONS ARE A TEDIOUS PACK OF PEOPLE, WHO HAVEN'T GOT THE REMOTEST KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO LIVE, NOR THE SMALLEST INSTINCT ABOUT WHEN TO DIE. - OH, THAT IS NONSENSE! - IT ISN'T. I WON'T ARGUE ABOUT THE MATTER. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT THINGS. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THINGS WERE ORIGINALLY MADE FOR. UPON MY WORD, IF I THOUGHT THAT, I'D SHOOT MYSELF. YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S MUCH CHANCE OF GWENDOLEN BECOMING LIKE HER MOTHER IN ABOUT 150 YEARS, DO YOU, ALGY? ALL WOMAN BECOME LIKE THEIR MOTHERS. THAT IS THEIR TRAGEDY. NO MAN DOES. THAT'S HIS. - IS THAT CLEVER? - IT IS PERFECTLY PHRASED. AND AS TRUE AS ANY OBSERVATION IN CIVILIZED LIFE SHOULD BE. I AM SICK TO DEATH OF CLEVERNESS. EVERYBODY IS SO CLEVER NOWADAYS. ONE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT MEETING CLEVER PEOPLE. THE THING HAS BECOME AN ABSOLUTE NUISANCE. - I WISH WE HAD A FEW FOOLS LEFT. - WE HAVE. I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET THEM. WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT? THE FOOLS? ABOUT THE CLEVER PEOPLE, OF COURSE. WHAT FOOLS! BY THE WAY, DID YOU TELL GWENDOLEN THE TRUTH ABOUT BEING "ERNEST" IN TOWN AND "JACK" IN THE COUNTRY? MY DEAR FELLOW, THE TRUTH ISN'T QUITE THE SORT OF THING ONE TELLS TO A NICE, SWEET, REFINED GIRL. WHAT EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE WAY TO BEHAVE TO A WOMAN. THE ONLY WAY TO BEHAVE TO A WOMAN IS TO MAKE LOVE TO HER IF SHE IS PRETTY - AND TO SOMEONE ELSE IF SHE IS PLAIN. - THAT IS NONSENSE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR BROTHER? WHAT ABOUT THE PROFLIGATE "ERNEST"? BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK I SHALL HAVE GOT RID OF HIM. I SHALL SAY HE DIED IN PARIS OF APOPLEXY. LOTS OF PEOPLE DIE OF APOPLEXY, QUITE SUDDENLY, DON'T THEY? YES, BUT IT'S HEREDITARY, MY DEAR FELLOW. IT'S A SORT OF THING THAT RUNS IN FAMILIES. YOU HAD BETTER SAY, A SEVERE CHILL. YOU ARE SURE A SEVERE CHILL ISN'T HEREDITARY, OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND? OF COURSE NOT! VERY WELL. MY POOR BROTHER ERNEST IS CARRIED OFF IN PARIS QUITE SUDDENLY BY A SEVERE CHILL. THAT GETS RID OF HIM. BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT MISS CARDEW WAS A LITTLE TOO INTERESTED IN YOUR BROTHER ERNEST? WON'T SHE FEEL HIS LOSS A GOOD DEAL? OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. CECILY IS NOT, I'M GLAD TO SAY, A SILLY, ROMANTIC GIRL. SHE HAS A CAPITAL APPETITE, GOES ON LONG WALKS, AND PAYS NO ATTENTION AT ALL TO HER LESSONS. I WOULD RATHER LIKE TO SEE CECILY. I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE YOU NEVER DO. SHE IS EXCESSIVELY PRETTY, AND ONLY JUST 18. HAVE YOU TOLD GWENDOLEN THAT YOU HAVE AN "EXCESSIVELY PRETTY" WARD WHO IS ONLY JUST 18? ONE DOESN'T BLURT THESE THINGS OUT TO PEOPLE. GWENDOLEN AND CECILY ARE PERFECTLY CERTAIN TO BE ABSOLUTELY GREAT FRIENDS. I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING THAT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY'VE MET THEY WILL BE CALLING EACH OTHER "SISTER." WOMEN ONLY DO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE CALLED EACH OTHER A LOT OF OTHER THINGS FIRST. NOW, DEAR BOY, IF WE WANT A GOOD TABLE AT WILLIS' TONIGHT, WE MUST GO AND DRESS. IT IS NEARLY 7:00. - IT ALWAYS IS NEARLY 7:00. - WELL, I'M HUNGRY. I NEVER KNEW YOU WHEN YOU WEREN'T. - MISS FAIRFAX. - GWENDOLEN, UPON MY WORD! ALGY, KINDLY TURN YOUR BACK. I HAVE SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO SAY TO MR. WORTHING. GWENDOLEN, I DON'T THINK I CAN ALLOW THIS AT ALL. ALGY, YOU ALWAYS ADOPT A STRICTLY IMMORAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS LIFE. YOU ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DO THAT. MY OWN DARLING! ERNEST, WE MAY NEVER BE MARRIED. FROM THE EXPRESSION ON MAMMA'S FACE, I FEAR WE NEVER SHALL. FEW PARENTS NOWADAYS PAY ANY REGARD TO WHAT THEIR CHILDREN SAY TO THEM. THE OLD-FASHIONED RESPECT FOR THE YOUNG IS FAST DYING OUT. WHATEVER INFLUENCE I EVER HAD OVER MAMMA, I LOST AT THE AGE OF THREE. THOUGH SHE MAY PREVENT US FROM BECOMING MAN AND WIFE, AND I MAY MARRY SOMEONE ELSE, AND MARRY OFTEN, NOTHING THAT SHE CAN POSSIBLY DO CAN ALTER MY ETERNAL DEVOTION TO YOU. DEAR GWENDOLEN! THE STORY OF YOUR ROMANTIC ORIGIN, AS RELATED TO ME BY MAMMA-- WITH UNPLEASING COMMENTS, HAS NATURALLY STIRRED THE DEEPER FIBERS OF MY NATURE. YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE FASCINATION. THE SIMPLICITY OF YOUR CHARACTER MAKES YOU EXQUISITELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME. YOUR TOWN ADDRESS AT THE ALBANY I HAVE. WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY? THE MANOR HOUSE, WOOLTON, HERTFORDSHIRE. THERE IS A GOOD POSTAL SERVICE, I SUPPOSE? IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO DO SOMETHING DESPERATE. THAT WILL REQUIRE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. - I WILL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU DAILY. - MY OWN ONE! - HOW LONG DO YOU REMAIN IN TOWN? - TILL MONDAY. GOOD! ALGY, YOU MAY TURN ROUND NOW. THANKS, I'VE TURNED ROUND ALREADY. YOU MAY ALSO RING THE BELL. YOU WILL ALLOW ME SEE YOU TO YOUR CARRIAGE, MY DARLING? - CERTAINLY. - I SHALL SEE MISS FAIRFAX OUT. YES, SIR. - A GLASS OF SHERRY, LANE. - YES, SIR. TOMORROW, LANE, I'M GOING BUNBURYING. YES, SIR. I SHALL PROBABLY NOT BE BACK TILL MONDAY. YOU CAN PUT UP MY DRESS CLOTHES, MY SMOKING JACKET - AND ALL THE BUNBURY SUITS. - YES, SIR. I HOPE TOMORROW WILL BE A FINE DAY, LANE. IT NEVER IS, SIR. LANE, YOU ARE A PERFECT PESSIMIST. I DO MY BEST TO GIVE SATISFACTION, SIR. THERE IS A SENSIBLE, INTELLECTUAL GIRL. THE ONLY GIRL I EVER CARED FOR IN MY LIFE. ( laughing ) WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU SO AMUSED AT? I'M A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT POOR BUNBURY, THAT IS ALL. IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE, YOUR FRIEND BUNBURY WILL GET YOU INTO A SERIOUS SCRAPE SOMEDAY. I LOVE SCRAPES. THEY ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE NEVER SERIOUS. THAT IS NONSENSE. ALGY, YOU NEVER TALK ANYTHING BUT NONSENSE. NOBODY EVER DOES. CECILY? CECILY! SURELY SUCH A UTILITARIAN OCCUPATION AS THE WATERING OF FLOWERS IS RATHER MOULTON'S DUTY THAN YOURS? ESPECIALLY AT A MOMENT WHEN INTELLECTUAL PLEASURES AWAIT YOU. YOUR GERMAN GRAMMAR IS ON THE TABLE. PRAY, OPEN IT AT PAGE 15. WE WILL REPEAT YESTERDAY'S LESSON. BUT I DON'T LIKE GERMAN. IT ISN'T AT ALL A BECOMING LANGUAGE. I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I LOOK QUITE PLAIN AFTER MY GERMAN LESSON. CHILD, YOU KNOW HOW ANXIOUS YOUR GUARDIAN IS THAT YOU SHOULD IMPROVE YOURSELF IN EVERY WAY. HE LAID PARTICULAR STRESS ON YOUR GERMAN, AS HE WAS LEAVING FOR TOWN YESTERDAY. INDEED, HE ALWAYS LAYS STRESS ON YOUR GERMAN WHEN HE IS LEAVING FOR TOWN. DEAR UNCLE JACK IS SO VERY SERIOUS. SOMETIMES HE IS SO SERIOUS, I THINK HE CANNOT BE QUITE WELL. YOUR GUARDIAN ENJOYS THE BEST OF HEALTH, AND HIS GRAVITY OF DEMEANOR IS ESPECIALLY TO BE COMMENDED IN ONE SO COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AS HE IS. I KNOW NO ONE WHO HAS A HIGHER SENSE OF DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY HE OFTEN LOOKS A LITTLE BORED WHEN WE THREE ARE TOGETHER. CECILY, I AM SURPRISED AT YOU. MR. WORTHING HAS MANY TROUBLES IN HIS LIFE. IDLE MERRIMENT AND TRIVIALITY WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IN HIS CONVERSATION. YOU MUST REMEMBER HIS CONSTANT ANXIETY ABOUT THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN, HIS BROTHER. I WISH UNCLE JACK WOULD ALLOW THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN TO COME DOWN HERE SOMETIMES. WE MIGHT HAVE A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HIM, MISS PRISM. I AM SURE YOU CERTAINLY WOULD. YOU KNOW GERMAN, AND GEOLOGY. THINGS OF THAT KIND INFLUENCE A MAN VERY MUCH. I DO NOT THINK EVEN I COULD PRODUCE ANY EFFECT ON A CHARACTER THAT, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN BROTHER'S ADMISSION, IS IRRETRIEVABLY WEAK AND VACILLATING. INDEED, I AM NOT SURE THAT I WOULD DESIRE TO RECLAIM HIM. I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS MODERN MANIA FOR TURNING BAD PEOPLE INTO GOOD PEOPLE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. AS A MAN SOWS, SO LET HIM REAP. YOU MUST PUT AWAY YOUR DIARY, CECILY. I DON'T SEE WHY YOU KEEP A DIARY AT ALL. I KEEP A DIARY IN ORDER TO ENTER THE WONDERFUL SECRETS OF MY LIFE. IF I DIDN'T WRITE THEM DOWN, I SHOULD FORGET ABOUT THEM. MEMORY, MY DEAD CECILY, IS THE DIARY THAT WE ALL CARRY ABOUT WITH US. BUT IT USUALLY CHRONICLES THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, AND COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED. I BELIEVE THAT MEMORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY ALL THE THREE-VOLUME NOVELS THAT MUDIE SENDS US. DO NOT SPEAK SLIGHTINGLY OF THE THREE-VOLUME NOVEL. I WROTE ONE MYSELF-- IN EARLIER DAYS. DID YOU REALLY, MISS PRISM? HOW WONDERFULLY CLEVER YOU ARE. I HOPE IT DID NOT END HAPPILY? I DON'T LIKE NOVELS THAT END HAPPILY. THEY DEPRESS ME SO MUCH. THE GOOD ENDED HAPPILY, AND THE BAD UNHAPPILY. THAT IS WHAT FICTION MEANS. I SUPPOSE SO. BUT IT SEEMS VERY UNFAIR. WAS YOUR NOVEL EVER PUBLISHED? ALAS, NO. THE MANUSCRIPT UNFORTUNATELY WAS... ABANDONED. I USE THE WORD IN THE SENSE OF LOST OR MISLAID. TO YOUR WORK, CHILD. THESE SPECULATIONS ARE PROFITLESS. BUT I SEE DEAR DR. CHASUBLE COMING UP THROUGH THE GARDEN. OH, DR. CHASUBLE! THIS IS INDEED A PLEASURE. HOW ARE WE THIS MORNING? MISS PRISM, YOU ARE, I TRUST, WELL? MISS PRISM HAS JUST BEEN COMPLAINING OF A SLIGHT HEADACHE. I THINK IT WOULD DO HER SO MUCH GOOD TO HAVE A SHORT STROLL WITH YOU IN THE PARK, DR. CHASUBLE. CECILY, I HAVE NOT MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT A HEADACHE. NO, DEAR MISS PRISM, I KNOW THAT. BUT I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT YOU HAD A HEADACHE. INDEED, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT, AND NOT ABOUT MY GERMAN LESSON, WHEN THE RECTOR CAME IN. I HOPE, CECILY, YOU ARE NOT INATTENTIVE. OH, I AM AFRAID I AM. THAT IS STRANGE. WERE I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE MISS PRISM'S PUPIL, I WOULD HANG UPON HER LIPS. I SPOKE METAPHORICALLY. MY METAPHOR WAS DRAWN FROM BEES. AHEM! MR. WORTHING, I SUPPOSE, HAS NOT RETURNED FROM TOWN YET? WE DO NOT EXPECT HIM TILL MONDAY AFTERNOON. AH, YES, HE USUALLY LIKES TO SPEND HIS SUNDAY IN LONDON. HE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHOSE SOLE AIM IS ENJOYMENT, AS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN, HIS BROTHER, SEEMS TO BE. BUT I MUST NOT DISTURB EGERIA AND HER PUPIL ANY LONGER. EGERIA? MY NAME IS LAETITIA, DOCTOR. A CLASSICAL ALLUSION MERELY, DRAWN FROM THE PAGAN AUTHORS. I SHALL SEE YOU BOTH, NO DOUBT, AT EVENSONG? I THINK, DEAR DOCTOR, I WILL TAKE A STROLL WITH YOU. I FIND I HAVE A HEADACHE AFTER ALL AND A WALK MIGHT DO IT GOOD. WITH PLEASURE, MISS PRISM, WITH PLEASURE. WE MIGHT GO AS FAR AS THE SCHOOLS AND BACK. THAT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL. CECILY, YOU WILL READ YOUR POLITICAL ECONOMY IN MY ABSENCE. THE CHAPTER ON THE FALL OF THE RUPEE YOU MAY OMIT. IT IS SOMEWHAT TOO SENSATIONAL. EVEN THESE METALLIC PROBLEMS HAVE THEIR MELODRAMATIC SIDE. HORRID POLITICAL ECONOMY. HORRID GEOGRAPHY. HORRID, HORRID GERMAN! A MR. ERNEST WORTHING HAS JUST DRIVEN OVER FROM THE STATION. HE HAS BROUGHT HIS LUGGAGE WITH HIM. "MR. ERNEST WORTHING, B.4, THE ALBANY, W." UNCLE JACK'S BROTHER! DID YOU TELL HIM MR. WORTHING WAS IN TOWN? YES, MISS. HE SEEMED VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED. I MENTIONED THAT YOU AND MISS PRISM WERE IN THE GARDEN. HE SAID HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY FOR A MOMENT. ASK MR. ERNEST WORTHING TO COME HERE. I SUPPOSE YOU HAD BETTER TALK TO THE HOUSEKEEPER ABOUT A ROOM FOR HIM. YES, MISS. I HAVE NEVER MET A REALLY WICKED PERSON BEFORE. I FEEL RATHER FRIGHTENED. I AM SO AFRAID HE WILL LOOK JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. HE DOES. YOU ARE MY LITTLE COUSIN, CECILY, I'M SURE. YOU ARE UNDER SOME STRANGE MISTAKE. I AM NOT LITTLE. IN FACT, I AM MORE THAN USUALLY TALL FOR MY AGE. BUT I AM YOUR COUSIN CECILY. YOU, I SEE FROM YOUR CARD, ARE UNCLE JACK'S BROTHER, MY COUSIN ERNEST, MY WICKED COUSIN ERNEST. I AM NOT REALLY WICKED AT ALL, COUSIN CECILY. YOU MUSTN'T THINK THAT I AM WICKED. IF YOU ARE NOT, THEN YOU HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN DECEIVING US ALL IN A VERY INEXCUSABLE MANNER. I HOPE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LEADING A DOUBLE LIFE, PRETENDING TO BE WICKED AND BEING REALLY GOOD ALL THE TIME. THAT WOULD BE HYPOCRISY. OH. OF COURSE I HAVE BEEN RATHER RECKLESS. - I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT. - IN FACT, NOW YOU MENTION THE SUBJECT, I HAVE BEEN VERY BAD IN MY OWN SMALL WAY. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD OF THAT, THOUGH I'M SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASANT. IT IS MUCH PLEASANTER BEING HERE WITH YOU. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARE HERE AT ALL. UNCLE JACK WON'T BE BACK TILL MONDAY AFTERNOON. THAT IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM OBLIGED TO GO UP BY THE FIRST TRAIN ON MONDAY MORNING. I HAVE A BUSINESS APPOINTMENT THAT I AM ANXIOUS... TO MISS. COULDN'T YOU MISS IT ANYWHERE BUT IN LONDON? NO, THE APPOINTMENT IS IN LONDON. WELL, I KNOW, OF COURSE, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS NOT TO KEEP A BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT, IF ONE WANTS TO RETAIN ANY SENSE OF THE BEAUTY OF LIFE, BUT STILL, I THINK YOU HAD BETTER WAIT TILL UNCLE JACK ARRIVES. I KNOW HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR EMIGRATING. - ABOUT MY WHAT? - YOUR EMIGRATING. HE HAS GONE UP TO BUY YOUR OUTFIT. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T LET JACK BUY MY OUTFIT. HE HAS NO TASTE IN NECKTIES AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL REQUIRE NECKTIES. UNCLE JACK IS SENDING YOU TO AUSTRALIA. AUSTRALIA! I'D SOONER DIE. HE SAID AT DINNER ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIS WORLD, THE NEXT WORLD AND AUSTRALIA. WELL, THE ACCOUNTS I HAVE RECEIVED OF AUSTRALIA AND THE NEXT WORLD ARE NOT PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING. THIS WORLD IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, COUSIN CECILY. YES, BUT ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH FOR IT? I AM AFRAID I AM NOT THAT. THAT IS WHY I WANT YOU TO REFORM ME. YOU MIGHT MAKE THAT YOUR MISSION, IF YOU DON'T MIND. I'M AFRAID I'VE NO TIME THIS AFTERNOON. WELL, WOULD YOU MIND MY REFORMING MYSELF, THIS AFTERNOON? IT IS RATHER QUIXOTIC OF YOU. BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY. I WILL. I FEEL BETTER ALREADY. YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE WORSE. - THAT IS BECAUSE I AM HUNGRY. - HOW THOUGHTLESS OF ME. I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT WHEN ONE IS GOING TO LEAD AN ENTIRELY NEW LIFE, ONE REQUIRES REGULAR AND WHOLESOME MEALS. - WON'T YOU COME IN? - THANK YOU. MIGHT I HAVE A BUTTONHOLE FIRST? I NEVER HAVE ANY APPETITE UNLESS I HAVE A BUTTONHOLE FIRST. A MARECHAL NIEL? NO, I'D SOONER HAVE A PINK ROSE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKE A PINK ROSE, COUSIN CECILY. I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT. MISS PRISM NEVER SAYS SUCH THINGS TO ME. THEN MISS PRISM IS A SHORTSIGHTED OLD LADY. YOU ARE THE PRETTIEST GIRL I EVER SAW. MISS PRISM SAYS THAT ALL GOOD LOOKS ARE A SNARE. THEY ARE A SNARE THAT EVERY SENSIBLE MAN WOULD LIKE TO BE CAUGHT IN. I DON'T THINK I WOULD CARE TO CATCH A SENSIBLE MAN. I SHOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT. YOU ARE TOO MUCH ALONE, DEAR DR. CHASUBLE. YOU SHOULD GET MARRIED. A MISANTHROPE I CAN UNDERSTAND, A WOMANTHROPE, NEVER! BELIEVE ME I DO NOT DESERVE SO NEOLOGISTIC A PHRASE. THE PRECEPT AS WELL AS THE PRACTICE OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH WAS DISTINCTLY AGAINST MATRIMONY. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY WHY THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH HAS NOT LASTED UP TO THE PRESENT DAY. YOU DO NOT SEEM TO REALIZE, DEAR DOCTOR, THAT BY PERSISTENTLY REMAINING SINGLE, A MAN CONVERTS HIMSELF INTO A PERMANENT PUBLIC TEMPTATION. MEN SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL. THIS VERY CELIBACY LEADS WEAKER VESSELS ASTRAY. BUT IS A MAN NOT EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN MARRIED? NO MARRIED MAN IS EVER ATTRACTIVE EXCEPT TO HIS WIFE. AND OFTEN, I'VE BEEN TOLD, NOT EVEN TO HER. THAT DEPENDS ON THE INTELLECTUAL SYMPATHIES OF THE WOMAN. MATURITY CAN ALWAYS BE DEPENDED ON. RIPENESS CAN BE TRUSTED. YOUNG WOMEN ARE GREEN. I SPOKE HORTICULTURALLY. MY METAPHOR WAS DRAWN FROM FRUITS. WHERE IS CECILY? PERHAPS SHE FOLLOWED US TO THE SCHOOLS? - Miss Prism: MR. WORTHING! - MR. WORTHING? Miss Prism: THIS IS INDEED A SURPRISE. WE DID NOT LOOK FOR YOU TILL MONDAY AFTERNOON. I HAVE RETURNED SOONER THAN EXPECTED. DR. CHASUBLE, I HOPE YOU ARE WELL? DEAR MR. WORTHING, I TRUST THIS GARB OF WOE DOES NOT BETOKEN SOME TERRIBLE CALAMITY? MY BROTHER. MORE SHAMEFUL DEBTS AND EXTRAVAGANCE? STILL LEADING HIS LIFE OF PLEASURE? DEAD! YOUR BROTHER ERNEST, DEAD? QUITE DEAD. WHAT A LESSON FOR HIM. I TRUST HE WILL PROFIT BY IT. MR. WORTHING, I OFFER YOU MY SINCERE CONDOLENCE. YOU HAVE AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING YOU WERE ALWAYS THE MOST GENEROUS AND FORGIVING OF BROTHERS. POOR ERNEST! HE HAD MANY FAULTS, BUT IT IS A SAD, SAD, BLOW. VERY SAD INDEED. WERE YOU WITH HIM AT THE END? NO, HE DIED ABROAD. IN PARIS, IN FACT. I HAD A TELEGRAM LAST NIGHT FROM THE MANAGER OF THE GRAND HOTEL. WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH MENTIONED? A SEVERE CHILL, IT SEEMS. AS A MAN SOWS, SO SHALL HE REAP. CHARITY, DEAR MISS PRISM, CHARITY! NONE OF US ARE PERFECT. I MYSELF AM PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DRAFTS. WILL THE INTERMENT TAKE PLACE HERE? NO! HE SEEMS TO HAVE EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO BE BURIED IN PARIS. IN PARIS? I FEAR THAT HARDLY POINTS TO ANY VERY SERIOUS STATE OF MIND AT THE LAST. YOU WOULD NO DOUBT WISH ME TO MAKE SOME SLIGHT ALLUSION TO THIS TRAGIC DOMESTIC AFFLICTION NEXT SUNDAY? MY SERMON ON THE MEANING OF THE MANNA IN THE WILDERNESS CAN BE ADAPTED TO ALMOST ANY OCCASION, JOYFUL, OR AS IN THE PRESENT CASE, DISTRESSING. I HAVE PREACHED IT AT HARVEST CELEBRATIONS, CHRISTENINGS, CONFIRMATIONS, ON DAYS OF HUMILIATION, AND FESTIVAL DAYS. THE LAST TIME I DELIVERED IT WAS IN THE CATHEDRAL, AS A CHARITY SERMON ON BEHALF OF "THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF DISCONTENT AMONG THE UPPER ORDERS." THE BISHOP, WHO WAS PRESENT, WAS MUCH STRUCK - BY SOME OF THE ANALOGIES I DREW. - AH! THAT REMINDS ME. YOU MENTIONED CHRISTENINGS, I THINK, DR. CHASUBLE? I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW HOW TO CHRISTEN ALL RIGHT? I MEAN, OF COURSE, YOU'RE CONTINUALLY CHRISTENING, AREN'T YOU? IT IS, I REGRET TO SAY, ONE OF THE RECTOR'S MOST CONSTANT DUTIES IN THIS PARISH. I'VE OFTEN SPOKEN TO THE POORER CLASSES ON THE SUBJECT. BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THRIFT IS. BUT IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR INFANT IN WHOM YOU ARE INTERESTED, MR. WORTHING? - YOUR BROTHER WAS UNMARRIED, WAS HE NOT? - OH, YES. PEOPLE WHO LIVE ENTIRELY FOR PLEASURE USUALLY ARE. BUT IT IS NOT FOR ANY CHILD, DEAR DOCTOR. I AM VERY FOND OF CHILDREN. NO, THE FACT IS, I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRISTENED MYSELF, THIS AFTERNOON-- IF YOU'VE NOTHING BETTER TO DO. BUT SURELY, MR. WORTHING, YOU'VE BEEN CHRISTENED ALREADY? I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HAVE YOU ANY GRAVE DOUBTS ON THE SUBJECT? I CERTAINLY INTEND TO HAVE. OF COURSE... I DON'T KNOW IF THE THING WOULD BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAY, OR IF YOU THINK I AM A LITTLE TOO OLD NOW. NOT AT ALL. THE SPRINKLING, AND, INDEED, THE IMMERSION OF ADULTS IS A PERFECTLY CANONICAL PRACTICE. IMMERSION? YOU NEED HAVE NO APPREHENSIONS. SPRINKLING IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY, OR, I THINK ADVISABLE. OUR WEATHER IS SO CHANGEABLE. WHAT HOUR WOULD YOU LIKE THE CEREMONY PERFORMED? I MIGHT TROT ROUND ABOUT 5:00, IF THAT WOULD SUIT YOU. PERFECTLY! IN FACT, I HAVE TWO SIMILAR CEREMONIES TO PERFORM AT THAT TIME. A CASE OF TWINS THAT OCCURRED RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THE OUTLYING COTTAGES ON YOUR OWN ESTATE. POOR JENKINS, THE CARTER, A MOST HARD-WORKING MAN. OH. I DON'T SEE MUCH FUN IN BEING CHRISTENED WITH OTHER BABIES. THAT WOULD BE CHILDISH. WOULD HALF PAST 5:00 DO? ADMIRABLY, ADMIRABLY. AND NOW, DEAR MR. WORTHING, I WILL NOT INTRUDE ANY LONGER INTO A HOUSE OF SORROW. I WOULD MERELY BEG YOU NOT TO BE TOO MUCH BOWED DOWN BY GRIEF. WHAT SEEMS TO US BITTER TRIALS ARE OFTEN BLESSINGS IN DISGUISE. THIS SEEMS TO ME A BLESSING OF AN EXTREMELY OBVIOUS KIND. Cecily: UNCLE JACK! I AM PLEASED TO SEE YOU BACK. BUT WHAT HORRID CLOTHES YOU'VE GOT ON. DO GO AND CHANGE THEM. - CECILY! - MY CHILD, MY CHILD. WHAT IS THE MATTER, UNCLE JACK? DO LOOK HAPPY! YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD A TOOTHACHE, AND I HAVE GOT SUCH A SURPRISE FOR YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK IS IN THE DINING ROOM? - YOUR BROTHER! - WHO? YOUR BROTHER ERNEST. HE ARRIVED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO. WHAT NONSENSE. I HAVEN'T GOT A BROTHER. DON'T SAY THAT. HOWEVER BADLY HE MAY HAVE BEHAVED TO YOU IN THE PAST, HE IS STILL YOUR BROTHER. YOU COULDN'T BE SO HEARTLESS AS TO DISOWN HIM. I'LL TELL HIM TO COME OUT, YOU WILL SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM, WON'T YOU? THESE ARE VERY JOYFUL TIDINGS. AFTER WE HAD BEEN RESIGNED TO HIS LOSS, HIS SUDDEN RETURN SEEMS PECULIARLY DISTRESSING. MY BROTHER IS IN THE DINING ROOM? I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT ALL MEANS. THIS IS PERFECTLY ABSURD. GOOD HEAVENS! BROTHER JOHN, I HAVE COME DOWN FROM TOWN TO TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE GIVEN YOU, AND THAT I INTEND TO LEAD A BETTER LIFE IN THE FUTURE. UNCLE JACK, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO REFUSE YOUR OWN BROTHER'S HAND? NOTHING WILL INDUCE ME TO TAKE HIS HAND. I THINK HIS COMING DOWN HERE DISGRACEFUL. HE KNOWS WHY. UNCLE JACK, DO BE NICE. THERE IS SOME GOOD IN EVERYONE. ERNEST HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT HIS POOR INVALID FRIEND, MR. BUNBURY, WHOM HE GOES TO VISIT SO OFTEN. AND SURELY THERE MUST BE MUCH GOOD IN ONE WHO IS KIND TO AN INVALID, AND LEAVES THE PLEASURES OF LONDON TO SIT BY A BED OF PAIN. HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUNBURY, HAS HE? YES, HE HAS TOLD ME ALL ABOUT MR. BUNBURY, AND HIS TERRIBLE HEALTH. I WON'T HAVE HIM TALK TO YOU ABOUT BUNBURY OR ANYTHING ELSE. IT IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE PERFECTLY FRANTIC. OF COURSE, I ADMIT THAT THE FAULTS WERE ALL ON MY SIDE, BUT I THINK BROTHER JOHN'S COLDNESS TO ME PECULIARLY PAINFUL. I EXPECTED A MORE ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME, CONSIDERING IT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE COME HERE. UNCLE JACK, IF YOU DON'T SHAKE HANDS WITH ERNEST, I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU. - NEVER FORGIVE ME? - NEVER, NEVER, NEVER! THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL EVER DO IT. IT IS PLEASANT, TO SEE SO PERFECT A RECONCILIATION. YOU HAVE DONE A BEAUTIFUL ACTION TODAY, DEAR CHILD, WE MUST NOT BE PREMATURE IN OUR JUDGMENTS. I FEEL VERY HAPPY. I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR. THERE IS AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WISHES TO SEE YOU. HE HAS COME IN A CAB FROM THE STATION. - Algernon: TO SEE ME? - YES, SIR. PARKER AND GRIBSBY, SOLICITORS. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. WHO ARE THEY? AH! - YOU HAD BETTER SHOW HIM IN, MERRIMAN. - VERY GOOD, SIR. PARKER AND GRIBSBY. I WONDER WHO THEY CAN BE? I EXPECT, "ERNEST," THEY HAVE COME ABOUT SOME BUSINESS FOR YOUR FRIEND, BUNBURY? PERHAPS BUNBURY WANTS TO MAKE HIS WILL AND WISHES YOU TO BE EXECUTOR. I HOPE, "ERNEST," YOU HAVE NO OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS OF ANY KIND. I HAVEN'T ANY DEBTS AT ALL, DEAR JACK. THANKS TO YOUR GENEROSITY. Merriman: MR. GRIBSBY. - MR. ERNEST WORTHING? - THIS IS MR. ERNEST WORTHING. - MR. ERNEST WORTHING? - YES. - OF B.4, THE ALBANY? - YES, THAT IS MY ADDRESS. I AM VERY SORRY, SIR, BUT WE HAVE A WRIT OF ATTACHMENT AGAINST YOU FOR 20 DAYS AT THE SUIT OF THE SAVOY HOTEL COMPANY LIMITED FOR 762 POUNDS, 14 SHILLINGS AND TUPPENCE. - AGAINST ME? - YES, SIR. WHAT PERFECT NONSENSE! I NEVER DINE AT THE SAVOY AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I ALWAYS DINE AT WILLIS'. IT IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE. I DON'T OWE A PENNY TO THE SAVOY. THE SUMMONS IS MARKED ON THE WRIT AS HAVING BEEN SERVED ON YOU PERSONALLY AT THE ALBANY ON MAY THE 27th. JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN IN DEFAULT AGAINST YOU ON JUNE THE 5th. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU NO LESS THAN 15 TIMES WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY REPLY. IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR CLIENTS WE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO OBTAIN AN ORDER FOR THE COMMITTAL OF YOUR PERSON. COMMITTAL?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMMITTAL? I HAVEN'T THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF GOING AWAY. I AM STAYING HERE FOR A WEEK. I AM STAYING WITH MY BROTHER. IF YOU IMAGINE I AM GOING UP TO TOWN THE MOMENT I ARRIVE, YOU ARE EXTREMELY MISTAKEN. I AM MERELY A SOLICITOR MYSELF. I DO NOT EMPLOY PERSONAL VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND. THE OFFICER OF THE COURT, WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO SEIZE THE PERSON OF THE DEBTOR, IS WAITING IN THE FLY OUTSIDE. HE HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN THESE MATTERS. THAT IS WHY WE ALWAYS EMPLOY HIM. BUT NO DOUBT, YOU WILL PREFER TO PAY THE BILL? PAY IT? HOW ON EARTH AM I GOING TO DO THAT? YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE GOT ANY MONEY? HOW PERFECTLY SILLY YOU ARE. NO GENTLEMAN EVER HAS ANY MONEY. MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT IS USUALLY RELATIONS WHO PAY. JACK, YOU REALLY MUST SETTLE THIS BILL. KINDLY ALLOW ME TO SEE THE PARTICULAR ITEMS, MR. GRIBSBY. 762 POUNDS, 14 SHILLINGS AND TUPPENCE SINCE LAST OCTOBER. I AM BOUND TO SAY I NEVER SAW SUCH RECKLESS EXTRAVAGANCE IN ALL MY LIFE. ?762 FOR EATING? WE ARE FAR AWAY FROM WORDSWORTH'S PLAIN LIVING AND HIGH THINKING. DEAR DOCTOR, DO YOU CONSIDER THAT I AM IN ANY WAY CALLED UPON TO PAY THIS MONSTROUS ACCOUNT FOR MY BROTHER? I AM BOUND TO SAY, I DO NOT THINK SO. - THIS PROPOSED INCARCERATION COULD BE MOST SALUTARY. - I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION. MY DEAR FELLOW, HOW RIDICULOUS YOU ARE. YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE BILL IS REALLY YOURS. - MINE? - YES, YOU KNOW IT IS. MR. WORTHING, IF THIS IS A JEST, IT IS OUT OF PLACE. - IT IS A GROSS EFFRONTERY. - NEVER MIND WHAT HE SAYS. THIS IS THE WAY HE ALWAYS GOES ON. YOU MEAN NOW TO SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT ERNEST WORTHING, RESIDING AT B.4, THE ALBANY? I WONDER, AS YOU ARE AT IT, YOU DON'T DENY BEING MY BROTHER AT ALL. WHY DON'T YOU? I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT, MY DEAR FELLOW. IT WOULD BE ABSURD. OF COURSE I'M YOUR BROTHER. THAT IS WHY YOU SHOULD PAY THIS BILL FOR ME. TIME PRESSES. WE HAVE TO BE AT HOLLOWAY NOT LATER THAN 4:00. OTHERWISE IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADMISSION. - THE RULES ARE VERY STRICT. - HOLLOWAY? IT IS AT HOLLOWAY THAT DETENTIONS OF THIS CHARACTER TAKE PLACE ALWAYS. WILL YOU COME NOW, SIR, IF IT WILL NOT BE INCONVENIENT TO YOU? - JACK? - PRAY BE FIRM, MR. WORTHING. I AM QUITE FIRM, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WEAKNESS OR DECEPTION OF ANY KIND IS. UNCLE JACK! I THINK YOU HAVE A LITTLE MONEY OF MINE, HAVEN'T YOU? LET ME PAY THIS BILL. I WOULDN'T LIKE YOUR OWN BROTHER TO BE IN PRISON. I COULDN'T POSSIBLY LET YOU PAY IT, CECILY. - THAT WOULD BE ABSURD. - THEN YOU WILL, WON'T YOU? OF COURSE, I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH HIM. YOU WON'T SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN, CECILY, WILL YOU? CERTAINLY NOT! UNLESS, OF COURSE, HE SPEAKS TO ME FIRST. IT WOULD BE VERY RUDE NOT TO ANSWER HIM. - Jack: MR. GRIBSBY... - YES, SIR? I'LL PAY THIS BILL FOR MY BROTHER. IT IS THE LAST BILL I SHALL EVER PAY FOR HIM, TOO. HOW MUCH IS IT? 762 POUNDS, 14 AND TUPPENCE. AH! THE CAB WILL BE FIVE-AND-NINEPENCE EXTRA-- - HIRED FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE CLIENT. - OF COURSE. I MUST SAY I FIND THIS GENEROSITY QUITE FOOLISH. THE HEART HAS ITS WISDOM AS WELL AS THE HEAD, MISS PRISM. THANK YOU. - GOOD DAY. - GOOD DAY. I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOU AGAIN. I SINCERELY HOPE NOT. QUITE SO... QUITE SO. I THINK WE MIGHT LEAVE THE BROTHERS TOGETHER. - CECILY, YOU WILL COME WITH US. - CERTAINLY, MISS PRISM. YOU YOUNG SCOUNDREL, ALGY. YOU MUST GET OUT OF THIS PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I DON'T ALLOW ANY BUNBURYING HERE. I HAVE PUT MR. ERNEST'S THINGS IN THE ROOM NEXT TO YOURS, SIR. I SUPPOSE THAT IS ALL RIGHT? WHAT? MR. ERNEST'S LUGGAGE, SIR. I HAVE UNPACKED IT AND PUT IT IN THE ROOM NEXT TO YOUR OWN. - HIS LUGGAGE? - THREE PORTMANTEAUS, A DRESSING CASE, TWO HATBOXES, AND A LARGE LUNCHEON BASKET. I AM AFRAID I CAN'T STAY MORE THAN A WEEK THIS TIME. MERRIMAN, ORDER THE DOGCART AT ONCE. - MR. ERNEST HAS BEEN SUDDENLY CALLED BACK TO TOWN. - YES, SIR. WHAT A FEARFUL LIAR YOU ARE, JACK. - I'VE NOT BEEN CALLED BACK TO TOWN AT ALL. - YES, YOU HAVE. YOUR DUTY AS A GENTLEMAN CALLS YOU BACK. MY DUTY AS A GENTLEMAN HAS NEVER INTERFERED WITH MY PLEASURES IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE. I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT. CECILY IS A DARLING. YOU ARE NOT TO TALK OF MISS CARDEW LIKE THAT. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE YOUR CLOTHES. YOU LOOK PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS IN THEM. WHY ON EARTH DON'T YOU GO UP AND CHANGE? IT IS PERFECTLY CHILDISH TO BE IN DEEP MOURNING FOR A MAN WHO IS ACTUALLY STAYING FOR A WHOLE WEEK WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUSE AS A GUEST. I CALL IT GROTESQUE. YOU ARE CERTAINLY NOT STAYING WITH ME AS A GUEST, OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU HAVE GOT TO LEAVE BY THE 4:05 TRAIN. I CERTAINLY WON'T LEAVE WHEN YOU'RE IN MOURNING. IT WOULD BE MOST UNFRIENDLY. IF I WERE IN MOURNING YOU WOULD STAY WITH ME, I SUPPOSE. I SHOULD THINK IT MOST UNKIND IF YOU DIDN'T. - WILL YOU GO IF I CHANGE MY CLOTHES? - YES. IF YOU DON'T TAKE SO LONG. I NEVER SAW ANYONE TAKE SO LONG TO DRESS, AND WITH SUCH LITTLE RESULT. THAT IS BETTER THAN BEING ALWAYS OVERDRESSED AS YOU ARE. IF I AM OCCASIONALLY A LITTLE OVERDRESSED, I MAKE UP FOR IT BY BEING ALWAYS IMMENSELY OVEREDUCATED. YOUR VANITY IS RIDICULOUS, YOUR CONDUCT AN OUTRAGE, AND YOUR PRESENCE IN MY GARDEN UTTERLY ABSURD. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE GOT TO CATCH THE THE 4:05 AND I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE A PLEASANT JOURNEY BACK TO TOWN. THIS BUNBURYING, AS YOU CALL IT, HAS NOT BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS FOR YOU. I THINK IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS. I AM IN LOVE WITH CECILY, AND THAT IS EVERYTHING. I PROMISED UNCLE JACK THAT I WOULDN'T SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN, UNLESS YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION OF SOME KIND. CECILY, MAYN'T I STAY TO TEA? I WONDER YOU CAN LOOK ME IN THE FACE AFTER YOUR CONDUCT. I LOVE LOOKING YOU IN THE FACE. BUT WHY DID YOU TRY TO PUT YOUR HORRID BILL ON POOR UNCLE JACK? I THINK THAT WAS INEXCUSABLE OF YOU. WHERE HAS UNCLE JACK GONE? HE'S GONE TO ORDER THE DOGCART FOR ME. - HE'S GOING TO SEND ME AWAY. - THEN HAVE WE GOT TO PART? I AM AFRAID SO. IT IS A VERY PAINFUL PARTING. IT IS ALWAYS PAINFUL TO PART FROM PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS KNOWN A VERY BRIEF SPACE OF TIME. THE ABSENCE OF OLD FRIENDS ONE CAN ENDURE WITH EQUANIMITY. BUT EVEN A MOMENTARY SEPARATION FROM ANYONE TO WHOM ONE HAS JUST BEEN INTRODUCED IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE. THANK YOU. THE DOGCART IS AT THE DOOR, SIR. IT CAN WAIT, MERRIMAN, FOR FIVE MINUTES. YES, MISS. I HOPE I SHALL NOT OFFEND YOU, CECILY, IF I STATE QUITE FRANKLY AND OPENLY THAT YOU SEEM TO ME TO BE IN EVERY WAY THE VISIBLE PERSONIFICATION OF ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. I THINK YOUR FRANKNESS DOES YOU GREAT CREDIT, ERNEST. IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME, I WILL COPY YOUR REMARKS INTO MY DIARY. DO YOU KEEP A DIARY? I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO LOOK AT IT. MAY I? OH, NO. YOU SEE, IT IS SIMPLY A VERY YOUNG GIRL'S RECORD OF HER OWN THOUGHTS AND IMPRESSIONS. AND CONSEQUENTLY MEANT FOR PUBLICATION. WHEN IT APPEARS IN VOLUME FORM, I HOPE YOU WILL ORDER A COPY. BUT PRAY, ERNEST, DON'T STOP. I DELIGHT IN TAKING DOWN FROM DICTATION. I HAVE REACHED "ABSOLUTE PERFECTION." YOU CAN GO ON. I AM QUITE READY FOR MORE. - AHEM! AHEM! - DON'T COUGH, ERNEST. WHEN ONE IS DICTATING, ONE SHOULD SPEAK FLUENTLY AND NOT COUGH. BESIDES, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL A COUGH. CECILY... EVER SINCE I LOOKED UPON YOUR WONDERFUL AND INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY, I HAVE NOT MERELY BEEN YOUR ABJECT SLAVE AND SERVANT, BUT SOARING UPON THE PINIONS OF A POSSIBLY MONSTROUS AMBITION, I HAVE DARED TO LOVE YOU WILDLY, PASSIONATELY, DEVOTEDLY-- OH--! PLEASE SAY THAT ALL OVER AGAIN. - CECILY, EVER SINCE I FIRST-- - I'VE GOT ALL THAT ALL RIGHT. I HAVE DARED TO LOVE YOU WILDLY, PASSIONATELY, DEVOTEDLY, HOPELESSLY. HOPELESSLY DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE, DOES IT? CECILY-- IS THAT THE BEGINNING OF AN ENTIRELY NEW PARAGRAPH? THE DOGCART IS WAITING, SIR. TELL IT TO COME ROUND NEXT WEEK AT THE SAME HOUR. YES, SIR. UNCLE JACK WOULD BE VERY MUCH ANNOYED IF HE KNEW YOU WERE STAYING TILL NEXT WEEK, AT THE SAME HOUR. I DON'T CARE ABOUT JACK. I DON'T CARE FOR ANYONE IN THE WORLD BUT YOU. I LOVE YOU, CECILY. YOU WILL MARRY ME, WON'T YOU? YOU SILLY BOY, OF COURSE. WHY, WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS? YES, IT WILL BE EXACTLY SIX MONTHS ON THURSDAY. BUT HOW DID WE BECOME ENGAGED? EVER SINCE DEAR UNCLE JACK FIRST CONFESSED TO US THAT HE HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO WAS VERY WICKED AND BAD, YOU, OF COURSE, HAVE FORMED THE CHIEF TOPIC OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MISS PRISM. A MAN WHO IS MUCH TALKED ABOUT IS ALWAYS VERY ATTRACTIVE. I DARESAY IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME, BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU, ERNEST. DARLING! BUT WHEN WAS THE ENGAGEMENT ACTUALLY SETTLED? ON THE 14th OF FEBRUARY LAST. WORN OUT BY YOUR ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF MY EXISTENCE, I DETERMINED TO END THE MATTER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AND AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF, I ACCEPTED YOU OUT HERE IN THE GARDEN. THE NEXT DAY, I BOUGHT THIS LITTLE RING IN YOUR NAME, AND THIS BANGLE WITH THE TRUE LOVERS' KNOT I PROMISED YOU ALWAYS TO WEAR. DID I GIVE YOU THIS? IT'S VERY PRETTY, ISN'T IT? YES, YOU'VE WONDERFULLY GOOD TASTE, ERNEST. IT'S THE EXCUSE I'VE ALWAYS GIVEN FOR YOUR LEADING SUCH A BAD LIFE. AND THIS IS THE BOX IN WHICH I KEEP ALL YOUR DEAR LETTERS. MY LETTERS? BUT MY OWN SWEET CECILY, I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN YOU ANY LETTERS. YOU NEED HARDLY REMIND ME OF THAT, ERNEST. I REMEMBER ONLY TOO WELL THAT I WAS FORCED TO WRITE YOUR LETTERS FOR YOU. I WROTE THREE TIMES A WEEK AND SOMETIMES OFTENER. DO LET ME READ THEM, CECILY. I COULDN'T POSSIBLY. THEY'D MAKE YOU FAR TOO CONCEITED. THE THREE YOU WROTE ME AFTER I HAD BROKEN OFF THE ENGAGEMENT ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, AND SO BADLY SPELLED THAT EVEN NOW I CAN HARDLY READ THEM WITHOUT CRYING A LITTLE. BUT WAS OUR ENGAGEMENT EVER BROKEN OFF? OF COURSE IT WAS. ON THE 22nd OF LAST MARCH. YOU CAN SEE THE ENTRY IF YOU LIKE. "TODAY I BROKE OFF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH ERNEST. I FEEL IT IS BETTER TO DO SO. THE WEATHER STILL CONTINUES CHARMING." BUT WHY ON EARTH DID YOU BREAK IT OFF? WHAT HAD I DONE? I HAD DONE NOTHING AT ALL. I AM VERY MUCH HURT TO HEAR YOU BROKE IT OFF. PARTICULARLY WHEN THE WEATHER WAS SO CHARMING. IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A REALLY SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT IF IT HADN'T BEEN BROKEN OFF AT LEAST ONCE. BUT I FORGAVE YOU BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT. WHAT A PERFECT ANGEL YOU ARE, CECILY. YOU DEAR, ROMANTIC BOY. BUT CECILY, YOU'LL NEVER BREAK OFF OUR ENGAGEMENT AGAIN? I DON'T THINK I COULD BREAK IT OFF NOW THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY MET YOU. BESIDES, OF COURSE, THERE IS THE QUESTION OF YOUR NAME. YES, OF COURSE. YOU MUSTN'T LAUGH AT ME, DARLING, BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GIRLISH DREAM OF MINE TO LOVE SOMEONE WHOSE NAME WAS ERNEST. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT NAME WHICH SEEMS TO INSPIRE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE. I PITY ANY POOR MARRIED WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND IS NOT CALLED ERNEST. DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU COULD NOT LOVE ME IF I HAD SOME OTHER NAME? BUT WHAT NAME? ANY NAME YOU LIKE-- ALGERNON, FOR INSTANCE. BUT I DON'T LIKE THE NAME OF ALGERNON. WELL, MY OWN DEAR, SWEET, LOVING LITTLE DARLING, I CAN'T SEE WHY YOU OBJECT TO THE NAME OF ALGERNON. IT IS NOT A BAD NAME. IT IS A RATHER ARISTOCRATIC NAME. HALF OF THE CHAPS WHO GET INTO BANKRUPTCY COURT ARE CALLED ALGERNON. BUT SERIOUSLY, CECILY, IF MY NAME WAS ALGY, COULDN'T YOU LOVE ME? I MIGHT RESPECT YOU, ERNEST. I MIGHT ADMIRE YOUR CHARACTER, BUT I FEAR THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. CECILY, YOUR RECTOR HERE IS, I SUPPOSE, THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED IN THE PRACTICE OF ALL THE RITES AND CEREMONIALS OF THE CHURCH? OH, YES. DR. CHASUBLE IS A MOST LEARNED MAN. HE HAS NEVER WRITTEN A SINGLE BOOK, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH HE KNOWS. I MUST SEE HIM AT ONCE ON A MOST IMPORTANT CHRISTENING-- I MEAN, ON MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS. - OH! - I SHAN'T BE AWAY MORE THAN A HALF AN HOUR. CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED SINCE FEBRUARY THE 14th, AND THAT I ONLY MET YOU TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME, I THINK IT IS RATHER HARD THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE ME FOR SO LONG A PERIOD AS HALF AN HOUR. COULDN'T YOU MAKE IT 20 MINUTES? I'LL BE BACK IN NO TIME. WHAT AN IMPETUOUS BOY HE IS. I LIKE HIS HAIR SO MUCH. I MUST ENTER HIS PROPOSAL IN MY DIARY. A MISS FAIRFAX HAS JUST CALLED TO SEE MR. WORTHING. ON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS, MISS FAIRFAX STATES. ISN'T MR. WORTHING IN HIS LIBRARY? MR. WORTHING WENT OVER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RECTORY SOME TIME AGO. PRAY ASK THE LADY TO COME OUT HERE. MR. WORTHING IS SURE TO BE BACK SOON. AND YOU CAN BRING TEA. YES, MISS. MISS FAIRFAX. I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MANY GOOD ELDERLY WOMEN WHO ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNCLE JACK IN SOME OF HIS PHILANTHROPIC WORK IN LONDON. I DON'T QUITE LIKE WOMEN WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PHILANTHROPIC WORK. I THINK IT IS SO FORWARD OF THEM. Merriman: MISS FAIRFAX. PRAY, LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU. MY NAME IS CECILY CARDEW. CECILY CARDEW? WHAT A VERY SWEET NAME. SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT FRIENDS. I LIKE YOU ALREADY MORE THAN I CAN SAY. MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE NEVER WRONG. HOW NICE OF YOU TO LIKE ME SO MUCH AFTER WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SUCH A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME. PRAY SIT DOWN. I MAY CALL YOU CECILY, MAY I NOT? WITH PLEASURE. YOU WILL ALWAYS CALL ME GWENDOLEN, WON'T YOU? IF YOU WISH. THEN THAT IS ALL QUITE SETTLED, IS IT NOT? I HOPE SO. PERHAPS THIS MIGHT BE A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR MY MENTIONING WHO I AM. MY FATHER IS LORD BRACKNELL. YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF PAPA, I SUPPOSE? I DON'T THINK SO. OUTSIDE THE FAMILY CIRCLE, PAPA, I AM GLAD TO SAY, IS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN. I THINK THAT IS QUITE AS IT SHOULD BE. THE HOME SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE PROPER SPHERE FOR THE MAN. AND CERTAINLY ONCE A MAN BEGINS TO NEGLECT HIS DOMESTIC DUTIES, HE BECOMES PAINFULLY EFFEMINATE, DOES HE NOT? AND I DON'T LIKE THAT. IT MAKES MEN SO VERY ATTRACTIVE. CECILY, MAMMA, WHOSE VIEWS ON EDUCATION ARE REMARKABLY STRICT, HAS BROUGHT ME UP TO BE EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED; IT IS PART OF HER SYSTEM. SO DO YOU MIND MY LOOKING AT YOU THROUGH MY GLASSES? NOT AT ALL, GWENDOLEN. I AM VERY FOND OF BEING LOOKED AT. YOU ARE HERE ON... A SHORT VISIT, I SUPPOSE? - OH, NO. I LIVE HERE. - REALLY? YOUR MOTHER, NO DOUBT, OR SOME FEMALE RELATIVE OF ADVANCED YEARS, RESIDES HERE ALSO? OH, NO, I HAVE NO MOTHER. NOR, IN FACT, ANY RELATIONS. INDEED? MY DEAR GUARDIAN, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISS PRISM, HAS THE ARDUOUS TASK OF LOOKING AFTER ME. - YOUR GUARDIAN? - I AM MR. WORTHING'S WARD. IT IS STRANGE HE NEVER MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE HAD A WARD. HOW VERY SECRETIVE OF HIM. HE GROWS MORE INTERESTING HOURLY. I AM NOT SURE, HOWEVER, THAT THE NEWS INSPIRES ME WITH FEELINGS OF UNMIXED DELIGHT. I AM VERY FOND OF YOU, CECILY. I HAVE LIKED YOU EVER SINCE I MET YOU, BUT I AM BOUND TO STATE THAT NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE MR. WORTHING'S WARD, I CANNOT HELP EXPRESSING A WISH THAT YOU WERE... WELL... JUST A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU SEEM TO BE, AND NOT QUITE SO VERY ALLURING IN APPEARANCE. IN FACT, IF I MAY SPEAK CANDIDLY-- PRAY DO! I THINK THAT WHENEVER ONE HAS ANYTHING UNPLEASANT TO SAY, ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BE QUITE CANDID. WELL... TO SPEAK WITH PERFECT CANDOR, CECILY... I WISH THAT YOU WERE FULLY 42 AND MORE THAN USUALLY PLAIN FOR YOUR AGE. ERNEST HAS A STRONG, UPRIGHT NATURE. HE IS THE VERY SOUL OF TRUTH AND HONOR. DISLOYALTY WOULD BE AS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM AS DECEPTION. BUT EVEN MEN OF THE NOBLEST POSSIBLE MORAL CHARACTER ARE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE PHYSICAL CHARMS OF OTHERS. MODERN, NO LESS THAN ANCIENT HISTORY, SUPPLIES US WITH MANY MOST PAINFUL EXAMPLES OF WHAT I REFER TO. IF IT WERE NOT SO, INDEED, HISTORY WOULD BE QUITE UNREADABLE. I BEG YOUR PARDON, GWENDOLEN, DID YOU SAY ERNEST? - YES. - BUT IT IS NOT MR. ERNEST WORTHING WHO IS MY GUARDIAN. IT IS HIS BROTHER-- HIS ELDER BROTHER. ERNEST NEVER MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE HAD A BROTHER. I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ON GOOD TERMS FOR A LONG TIME. OH. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT. NOW I THINK OF IT, I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY MAN MENTION HIS BROTHER. THE SUBJECT SEEMS DISTASTEFUL TO MOST MEN. CECILY, YOU HAVE LIFTED A LOAD FROM MY MIND. I WAS GROWING ALMOST ANXIOUS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE IF ANY CLOUD HAD COME ACROSS A FRIENDSHIP LIKE OURS, WOULD IT NOT? OF COURSE, YOU ARE QUITE, QUITE SURE THAT IT IS NOT MR. ERNEST WORTHING WHO IS YOUR GUARDIAN? QUITE SURE. IN FACT, I AM GOING TO BE HIS. I BEG YOUR PARDON? DEAREST GWENDOLEN, THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD MAKE A SECRET OF IT TO YOU. OUR LITTLE COUNTRY NEWSPAPER IS SURE TO CHRONICLE THE FACT NEXT WEEK. MR. ERNEST WORTHING AND I ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED. MY DARLING CECILY, I FEEL THERE MUST BE SOME SLIGHT ERROR. MR. ERNEST WORTHING IS ENGAGED TO ME. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL APPEAR IN THE MORNING POST ON SATURDAY AT THE LATEST. I'M AFRAID YOU MUST BE UNDER SOME MISCONCEPTION. ERNEST PROPOSED TO ME EXACTLY 10 MINUTES AGO. IT IS CERTAINLY VERY CURIOUS, FOR HE ASKED ME TO BE HIS WIFE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AT 5:30. IF YOU WOULD CARE TO VERIFY THE INCIDENT, PRAY DO SO. I NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT MY DIARY. ONE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING SENSATIONAL TO READ IN THE TRAIN. I AM SO SORRY, DEAR CECILY, IF IT IS ANY DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOU, BUT I'M AFRAID I HAVE THE PRIOR CLAIM. IT WOULD DISTRESS ME MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU, DEAR GWENDOLEN, IF IT CAUSED YOU ANY MENTAL OR PHYSICAL ANGUISH, BUT I FEEL BOUND TO POINT OUT THAT SINCE ERNEST PROPOSED TO YOU, HE HAS CLEARLY CHANGED HIS MIND. IF THE POOR BOY HAS BEEN... ENTRAPPED INTO ANY FOOLISH PROMISE, I SHALL CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO RESCUE HIM AT ONCE, AND WITH A FIRM HAND. WHATEVER UNFORTUNATE ENTANGLEMENT MY DEAR BOY MAY HAVE GOT INTO, I WILL NEVER REPROACH HIM WITH IT AFTER WE ARE MARRIED. DO YOU ALLUDE TO ME, MISS CARDEW, AS AN ENTANGLEMENT? YOU ARE PRESUMPTUOUS. ON AN OCCASION OF THIS KIND IT BECOMES MORE THAN A MORAL DUTY TO SPEAK ONE'S MIND, IT BECOMES A PLEASURE. DO YOU SUGGEST, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT I ENTRAPPED ERNEST INTO AN ENGAGEMENT? HOW DARE YOU! THIS IS NO TIME FOR WEARING THE SHALLOW MASK OF MANNERS. WHEN I SEE A SPADE, I CALL IT A SPADE. I AM GLAD TO SAY I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SPADE. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT OUR SOCIAL SPHERES HAVE BEEN WIDELY DIFFERENT. SHALL I LAY TEA HERE AS USUAL, MISS? YES, AS USUAL. ARE THERE MANY INTERESTING WALKS IN THE VICINITY, MISS CARDEW? OH, YES, A GREAT MANY. FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE HILLS QUITE CLOSE ONE CAN SEE FIVE COUNTIES. FIVE COUNTIES! I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE THAT. I HATE CROWDS. I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY YOU LIVE IN THE TOWN? QUITE A WELL-KEPT GARDEN THIS IS, MISS CARDEW. SO GLAD YOU LIKE IT, MISS FAIRFAX. I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY FLOWERS IN THE COUNTRY. FLOWERS ARE AS COMMON HERE, MISS FAIRFAX, AS PEOPLE ARE IN LONDON. PERSONALLY, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY MANAGES TO EXIST IN THE COUNTRY, IF ANYBODY WHO IS ANYBODY DOES. THE COUNTRY ALWAYS BORES ME TO DEATH. AH, THIS IS WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS CALL "AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION," IS IT NOT? I BELIEVE THE ARISTOCRACY ARE SUFFERING VERY MUCH FROM IT AT PRESENT. IT IS ALMOST AN EPIDEMIC AMONGST THEM, I HAVE BEEN TOLD. MAY I OFFER YOU SOME TEA, MISS FAIRFAX? THANK YOU. DETESTABLE GIRL! BUT I REQUIRE TEA! SUGAR? NO, THANK YOU. SUGAR IS NOT FASHIONABLE ANY MORE. CAKE, OR BREAD AND BUTTER? ( chuckles ) BREAD AND BUTTER, PLEASE. CAKE IS RARELY SEEN AT THE BEST HOUSES NOWADAYS. HAND THAT TO MISS FAIRFAX. YOU HAVE FILLED MY TEA WITH LUMPS OF SUGAR, AND THOUGH I ASKED MOST DISTINCTLY FOR BREAD AND BUTTER, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME CAKE. I AM KNOWN FOR THE GENTLENESS OF MY DISPOSITION, AND THE EXTRAORDINARY SWEETNESS OF MY NATURE, BUT I WARN YOU, MISS CARDEW, YOU MAY GO TOO FAR. TO SAVE MY POOR, INNOCENT TRUSTING BOY FROM THE MACHINATIONS OF ANY OTHER GIRL THERE ARE NO LENGTHS TO WHICH I WOULD NOT GO. FROM THE MOMENT I SAW YOU I DISTRUSTED YOU. I FELT THAT YOU WERE FALSE AND DECEITFUL. I AM NEVER DECEIVED IN SUCH MATTERS. MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE INVARIABLY RIGHT. IT SEEMS TO ME, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT I AM TRESPASSING ON YOUR VALUABLE TIME. NO DOUBT YOU HAVE MANY OTHER CALLS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER TO MAKE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. ERNEST! - MY OWN ERNEST! - GWENDOLEN, DARLING! A MOMENT. MAY I ASK IF YOU ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO THIS... YOUNG LADY? TO DEAR LITTLE CECILY? OF COURSE NOT! WHAT COULD HAVE PUT SUCH AN IDEA IN YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD? THANK YOU. YOU MAY. I KNEW THERE MUST BE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING. THE GENTLEMAN WHOSE ARM IS AT PRESENT AROUND YOUR WAIST IS MY GUARDIAN, MR. JOHN WORTHING. - I BEG YOUR PARDON? - THIS IS UNCLE JACK. JACK--?! OH! - HERE IS ERNEST. - MY OWN LOVE! A MOMENT, ERNEST. MAY I ASK YOU-- ARE YOU ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO THIS YOUNG LADY? TO WHAT YOUNG-- GOOD HEAVENS, GWENDOLEN! YES, TO GOOD HEAVENS, GWENDOLEN. - I MEAN, TO GWENDOLEN? - OF COURSE NOT! WHAT COULD HAVE PUT SUCH AN IDEA INTO YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD? THANK YOU. YOU MAY. I FELT THERE MUST BE SOME SLIGHT ERROR, MISS CARDEW. THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS NOW EMBRACING YOU IS MY COUSIN, MR. ALGERNON MONCRIEFF. ALGERNON MONCRIEFF! OH! ARE YOU CALLED ALGERNON? - I CANNOT DENY IT. - OH! IS YOUR NAME REALLY... JOHN? I COULD DENY IT IF I LIKED. I COULD DENY ANYTHING IF I LIKED. BUT MY NAME CERTAINLY IS JOHN. IT HAS BEEN JOHN FOR YEARS. A GROSS DECEPTION HAS BEEN PRACTICED ON BOTH OF US. MY POOR, WOUNDED CECILY! MY SWEET, WRONGED GWENDOLEN! YOU WILL CALL ME SISTER, WILL YOU NOT? THERE IS JUST ONE QUESTION I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ALLOWED TO ASK MY GUARDIAN. AN ADMIRABLE IDEA! MR. WORTHING, THERE IS JUST ONE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO BE PERMITTED TO PUT TO YOU. WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER ERNEST? WE ARE BOTH ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO YOUR BROTHER ERNEST, SO IT IS A MATTER OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO US TO KNOW WHERE YOUR BROTHER ERNEST IS AT PRESENT. GWENDOLEN, CECILY-- IT IS VERY PAINFUL FOR ME TO BE FORCED TO SPEAK THE TRUTH. IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN REDUCED TO SUCH A PAINFUL POSITION, AND I AM REALLY QUITE INEXPERIENCED IN DOING ANYTHING OF THE KIND. HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU QUITE FRANKLY THAT I HAVE NO BROTHER ERNEST. I HAVE NO BROTHER AT ALL. I HAVE NEVER HAD A BROTHER, AND I CERTAINLY HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF EVER HAVING ONE IN THE FUTURE. - NO BROTHER AT ALL? - NONE! HAD YOU NEVER A BROTHER OF ANY KIND? NEVER, NOT EVEN OF ANY KIND. I AM AFRAID IT IS QUITE CLEAR, CECILY, THAT NEITHER OF US IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ANYONE. IT IS NOT A VERY PLEASANT POSITION FOR A YOUNG GIRL TO SUDDENLY FIND HERSELF IN, IS IT? LET US GO INTO THE HOUSE. THEY WILL HARDLY VENTURE TO COME AFTER US THERE. NO. MEN ARE SO COWARDLY, AREN'T THEY? THIS GHASTLY STATE OF THINGS IS WHAT YOU CALL BUNBURYING, I SUPPOSE? YES... AND A PERFECTLY WONDERFUL BUNBURY IT IS, TOO. THE MOST WONDERFUL BUNBURY I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER TO BUNBURY HERE. THAT IS ABSURD. ONE HAS A RIGHT TO BUNBURY ANYWHERE ONE CHOOSES. - EVERY SERIOUS BUNBURYIST KNOWS THAT. - SERIOUS BUNBURYIST? ONE MUST BE SERIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING, IF ONE WANTS TO HAVE ANY AMUSEMENT IN LIFE. AS FOR YOUR CONDUCT TOWARDS MISS CARDEW, I MUST SAY THAT YOUR TAKING IN A SWEET, SIMPLE, INNOCENT GIRL LIKE THAT IS QUITE INEXCUSABLE. TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT SHE IS MY WARD. I CAN SEE NO DEFENSE FOR YOUR DECEIVING A BRILLIANT, CLEVER, EXPERIENCED YOUNG LADY LIKE MISS FAIRFAX. TO SAY NOTHING THAT SHE'S MY COUSIN. I WANTED TO BE ENGAGED TO GWENDOLEN. I LOVE HER. I SIMPLY WANTED TO BE ENGAGED TO CECILY. I ADORE HER. THERE IS CERTAINLY NO CHANCE OF YOUR MARRYING MISS CARDEW. I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX BEING UNITED. - THAT IS NO BUSINESS OF YOURS. - IF IT WAS, I SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS VERY VULGAR TO TALK ABOUT ONE'S BUSINESS. PEOPLE LIKE STOCKBROKERS DO THAT, AND THEN MERELY AT DINNER PARTIES. HOW YOU CAN SIT THERE, CALMLY EATING MUFFINS, WHEN WE ARE IN THIS TROUBLE, I CAN'T MAKE OUT. YOU SEEM TO BE PERFECTLY HEARTLESS. WELL, I CAN'T EAT MUFFINS IN AN AGITATED MANNER. THE BUTTER WOULD PROBABLY GET ON MY CUFFS. I AM EATING MUFFINS BECAUSE I AM UNHAPPY. BESIDES, I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF MUFFINS. THAT IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD EAT THEM IN THAT GREEDY WAY. I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE TEACAKE INSTEAD. I DON'T LIKE TEACAKE. A MAN MAY EAT HIS OWN MUFFINS IN HIS OWN GARDEN. YOU SAID IT WAS PERFECTLY HEARTLESS TO EAT MUFFINS. IT WAS PERFECTLY HEARTLESS OF YOU, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT IS A DIFFERENT THING. THAT MAY BE, BUT THE MUFFINS ARE THE SAME. ALGY, I WISH TO GOODNESS YOU WOULD GO. YOU CAN'T ASK ME TO GO WITHOUT HAVING DINNER. IT'S ABSURD. I NEVER GO WITHOUT MY DINNER. NO ONE DOES, EXCEPT VEGETARIANS AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THAT IS NONSENSE! YOU NEVER TALK ANYTHING BUT NONSENSE. - YOU ARE AT THE MUFFINS AGAIN! - I'VE ASKED YOU TO GO. - I DON'T WANT YOU HERE! - I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY TEA. AND THERE IS STILL ONE MUFFIN LEFT. THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT FOLLOW US AT ONCE INTO THE HOUSE, AS ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE, SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME SENSE OF SHAME LEFT. THEY HAVE BEEN EATING MUFFINS. THAT LOOKS LIKE REPENTANCE. THEY DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE US AT ALL. - COULDN'T YOU COUGH? - BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A COUGH. THEY'RE LOOKING AT US. WHAT EFFRONTERY! THEY'RE APPROACHING. THAT'S VERY FORWARD OF THEM. LET US PRESERVE A DIGNIFIED SILENCE. CERTAINLY. IT IS THE ONLY THING TO DO NOW. ( men whistling ) THIS DIGNIFIED SILENCE SEEMS TO PRODUCE AN UNPLEASANT EFFECT. - A MOST DISTASTEFUL ONE. - BUT WE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK. - CERTAINLY NOT. - MR. WORTHING! I HAVE SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO ASK YOU. MUCH DEPENDS ON YOUR REPLY. GWENDOLEN, YOUR COMMON SENSE IS INVALUABLE. MR. MONCRIEFF, KINDLY ANSWER ME THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. WHY DID YOU PRETEND TO BE MY GUARDIAN'S BROTHER? IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF MEETING YOU. THAT CERTAINLY SEEMS A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION, - DOES IT NOT? - YES DEAR, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE HIM. I DON'T, BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF HIS ANSWER. TRUE-- IN MATTERS OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE, STYLE, NOT SINCERITY, IS THE VITAL THING. MR. WORTHING, WHAT EXPLANATION CAN YOU OFFER TO ME FOR PRETENDING TO HAVE A BROTHER? WAS IT IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMING UP TO TOWN TO SEE ME AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE? CAN YOU DOUBT IT, MISS FAIRFAX? I HAVE THE GRAVEST DOUBTS UPON THE SUBJECT. BUT I INTEND TO CRUSH THEM. THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT FOR GERMAN SKEPTICISM. THEIR EXPLANATIONS APPEAR TO BE QUITE SATISFACTORY, ESPECIALLY MR. WORTHING'S. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE THE STAMP OF TRUTH UPON IT. I AM MORE THAN CONTENT WITH WHAT MR. MONCRIEFF SAID. HIS VOICE ALONE INSPIRES ONE WITH ABSOLUTE CREDULITY. THEN YOU THINK WE SHOULD FORGIVE THEM? YES. I MEAN, NO! TRUE! I HAD FORGOTTEN. THERE ARE PRINCIPLES AT STAKE THAT ONE CANNOT SURRENDER. WHICH OF US SHOULD TELL THEM? THE TASK IS NOT A PLEASANT ONE. COULD WE NOT BOTH SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME? AN EXCELLENT IDEA! I NEARLY ALWAYS SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME AS OTHER PEOPLE. - WILL YOU TAKE THE TIME FROM ME? - CERTAINLY. Both: YOUR CHRISTIAN NAMES ARE STILL AN INSUPERABLE BARRIER. THAT IS ALL. Both: OUR CHRISTIAN NAMES! IS THAT ALL? BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE CHRISTENED THIS AFTERNOON. FOR MY SAKE, YOU ARE PREPARED - TO DO THIS TERRIBLE THING? - I AM! TO PLEASE ME YOU ARE READY TO FACE - THIS FEARFUL ORDEAL? - I AM! HOW ABSURD TO TALK OF THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES! WHERE QUESTIONS OF SELF-SACRIFICE ARE CONCERNED, MEN ARE INFINITELY BEYOND US. WE ARE. THEY HAVE MOMENTS OF PHYSICAL COURAGE OF WHICH WE WOMEN KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. DARLING! Both men: DARLING! AHEM, AHEM! LADY BRACKNELL! GOOD HEAVENS! GWENDOLEN, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? MERELY THAT I AM ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO MR. WORTHING. COME HERE. SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN IMMEDIATELY. HESITATION OF ANY KIND IS A SIGN OF MENTAL DECAY IN THE YOUNG, OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS IN THE OLD. APPRISED, SIR, OF MY DAUGHTER'S SUDDEN FLIGHT BY HER TRUSTY MAID, WHOSE CONFIDENCE I PURCHASED BY MEANS OF A SMALL COIN, I FOLLOWED HER AT ONCE BY LUGGAGE TRAIN. HER UNHAPPY FATHER IS, I AM GLAD TO SAY, UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE IS ATTENDING A MORE THAN USUALLY LENGTHY LECTURE BY THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SCHEME ON THE INFLUENCE OF A PERMANENT INCOME ON THOUGHT. I DO NOT PROPOSE TO UNDECEIVE HIM. INDEED, I HAVE NEVER UNDECEIVED HIM ON ANY QUESTION. I WOULD CONSIDER IT WRONG. BUT OF COURSE, YOU WILL CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MY DAUGHTER MUST CEASE IMMEDIATELY FROM THIS MOMENT. ON THIS POINT, AS INDEED ON ALL POINTS, I AM FIRM. I AM ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO GWENDOLEN, LADY BRACKNELL. YOU ARE NOTHING OF THE KIND, SIR. AND NOW, AS REGARDS ALGERNON... ALGERNON? YES, AUNT AUGUSTA. MAY I ASK IF IT IS IN THIS HOUSE THAT YOUR INVALID FRIEND MR. BUNBURY RESIDES? OH, NO, BUNBURY DOESN'T LIVE HERE. BUNBURY IS SOMEWHERE ELSE AT PRESENT. IN FACT, BUNBURY IS DEAD. DEAD? WHEN DID MR. BUNBURY DIE? HIS DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUDDEN. I KILLED BUNBURY THIS AFTERNOON. I MEAN, POOR BUNBURY DIED THIS AFTERNOON. - WHAT DID HE DIE OF? - HE WAS QUITE EXPLODED. EXPLODED? WAS HE THE VICTIM OF A REVOLUTIONARY OUTRAGE? I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MR. BUNBURY WAS INTERESTED IN SOCIAL LEGISLATION. IF SO, HE IS WELL PUNISHED FOR HIS MORBIDITY. MY DEAR AUNT AUGUSTA, I MEAN HE WAS FOUND OUT. THE DOCTORS FOUND OUT THAT BUNBURY COULD NOT LIVE, THAT IS WHAT I MEAN-- SO POOR BUNBURY DIED. HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE OPINION OF HIS PHYSICIANS. I AM GLAD, HOWEVER, THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND AT THE LAST TO SOME DEFINITE COURSE OF ACTION, AND ACTED UNDER PROPER MEDICAL ADVICE. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE FINALLY GOT RID OF THIS MR. BUNBURY, MAY I ASK, MR. WORTHING, WHO IS THAT YOUNG PERSON WHOSE HAND MY NEPHEW ALGERNON IS NOW HOLDING IN WHAT SEEMS TO ME A PECULIARLY UNNECESSARY MANNER? THAT LADY IS MISS CECILY CARDEW, MY WARD. I AM ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO CECILY, AUNT AUGUSTA. I BEG YOUR PARDON? MR. MONCRIEFF AND I ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED, LADY BRACKNELL. I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING PECULIARLY EXCITING IN THE AIR OF THIS PARTICULAR PART OF HERTFORDSHIRE, BUT THE NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENTS THAT GO ON SEEMS TO ME CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE PROPER AVERAGE THAT STATISTICS HAVE LAID DOWN FOR OUR GUIDANCE. I THINK SOME PRELIMINARY INQUIRY ON MY PART WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE. MR. WORTHING... IS MISS CARDEW AT ALL CONNECTED WITH ANY OF THE LARGER RAILWAY STATIONS IN LONDON? I MERELY DESIRE INFORMATION. UNTIL YESTERDAY, I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WERE ANY FAMILIES OR PERSONS WHOSE ORIGIN WAS A TERMINUS. MISS CARDEW IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE LATE MR. THOMAS CARDEW OF 149 BELGRAVE SQUARE, S.W., GERVASE PARK, DORKING, SURREY, AND THE SPORRAN, FIFESHIRE, N.B. THAT SOUNDS NOT UNSATISFACTORY. THREE ADDRESSES ALWAYS INSPIRE CONFIDENCE, EVEN IN TRADESMEN. BUT WHAT PROOF HAVE I OF THEIR AUTHENTICITY? I HAVE CAREFULLY PRESERVED THE COURT GUIDES OF THE PERIOD. THEY ARE OPEN TO YOUR INSPECTION. I HAVE KNOWN STRANGE ERRORS IN THAT PUBLICATION. MISS CARDEW'S FAMILY SOLICITORS ARE MESSIEURS MARKBY, MARKBY, AND MARKBY. MARKBY, MARKBY, AND MARKBY? A FIRM OF THE VERY HIGHEST POSITION IN THEIR PROFESSION. INDEED, I AM TOLD THAT ONE OF THE MARKBYS IS OCCASIONALLY TO BE SEEN AT DINNER PARTIES. SO FAR, I AM SATISFIED. HOW EXTREMELY KIND OF YOU, LADY BRACKNELL. I HAVE ALSO IN MY POSSESSION, YOU WILL BE PLEASED TO HEAR, CERTIFICATES OF MISS CARDEW'S BIRTH, BAPTISM, WHOOPING COUGH, REGISTRATION, VACCINATION, CONFIRMATION, AND THE MEASLES-- BOTH THE ENGLISH AND THE GERMAN VARIETY. AHH... A LIFE CROWDED WITH INCIDENT, I SEE. THOUGH PERHAPS SOMEWHAT TOO EXCITING FOR A YOUNG GIRL. I AM NOT MYSELF IN FAVOR OF PREMATURE EXPERIENCES. GWENDOLEN, THE TIME APPROACHES FOR OUR DEPARTURE. WE HAVE NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE. AS A MATTER OF FORM, MR. WORTHING, I HAD BETTER ASK YOU IF MISS CARDEW HAS ANY LITTLE FORTUNE? OH, ABOUT ?130,000 IN THE FUNDS. THAT IS ALL. GOODBYE, LADY BRACKNELL. SO PLEASED TO HAVE SEEN YOU. A MOMENT, MR. WORTHING. ?130,000? AND IN THE FUNDS? MISS CARDEW SEEMS TO ME A MOST ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY, NOW THAT I LOOK AT HER. FEW GIRLS OF THE PRESENT DAY HAVE ANY REALLY SOLID QUALITIES, ANY OF THE QUALITIES THAT LAST, AND IMPROVE WITH TIME. WE LIVE, I REGRET TO SAY, IN AN AGE OF SURFACES. COME OVER HERE, DEAR. PRETTY CHILD, YOUR DRESS IS SADLY SIMPLE, AND YOUR HAIR... SEEMS ALMOST AS NATURE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT. BUT WE CAN SOON ALTER ALL THAT. A THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED FRENCH MAID PRODUCES A REALLY MARVELOUS RESULT IN A VERY BRIEF SPACE OF TIME. I REMEMBER RECOMMENDING ONE TO YOUNG LADY LANSING, AND AFTER THREE MONTHS, HER OWN HUSBAND DID NOT KNOW HER. AND AFTER SIX MONTHS NOBODY KNEW HER. KINDLY TURN AROUND, SWEET CHILD. NO, THE SIDE VIEW IS WHAT I WANT. YES, QUITE AS I EXPECTED. THERE ARE DISTINCT SOCIAL POSSIBILITIES IN YOUR PROFILE. TWO WEAK POINTS IN OUR AGE ARE ITS WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND ITS WANT OF PROFILE. THE CHIN A LITTLE HIGHER, DEAR. STYLE LARGELY DEPENDS ON HOW THE CHIN IS WORN. THEY ARE WORN VERY HIGH, JUST AT PRESENT. ALGERNON? YES, AUNT AUGUSTA. THERE ARE DISTINCT SOCIAL POSSIBILITIES IN MISS CARDEW'S PROFILE. CECILY IS THE SWEETEST, DEAREST, PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD, AND I DON'T CARE TUPPENCE ABOUT SOCIAL POSSIBILITIES. NEVER SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF SOCIETY, ALGERNON. ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET INTO IT DO THAT. DEAR CHILD... OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT ALGERNON HAS NOTHING BUT HIS DEBTS TO DEPEND UPON. BUT I DO NOT APPROVE OF MERCENARY MARRIAGES. WHEN I MARRIED LORD BRACKNELL, I HAD NO FORTUNE OF ANY KIND. BUT I NEVER DREAMT FOR A MOMENT OF ALLOWING THAT TO STAND IN MY WAY. WELL, I SUPPOSE I MUST GIVE MY CONSENT. THANK YOU, AUNT AUGUSTA. CECILY, YOU MAY KISS ME. THANK YOU, LADY BRACKNELL. YOU MAY ALSO ADDRESS ME AS "AUNT AUGUSTA" FOR THE FUTURE. THANK YOU, AUNT AUGUSTA. THE MARRIAGE, I THINK, HAD BETTER TAKE PLACE QUITE SOON. - THANK YOU, AUNT AUGUSTA. - THANK YOU, AUNT AUGUSTA. FRANKLY, I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF LONG ENGAGEMENTS. THEY GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING OUT EACH OTHER'S CHARACTER BEFORE MARRIAGE, WHICH I THINK IS NEVER ADVISABLE. Jack: I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU, BUT THIS ENGAGEMENT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I AM MISS CARDEW'S GUARDIAN, AND SHE CANNOT MARRY WITHOUT MY CONSENT UNTIL SHE COMES OF AGE. THAT CONSENT I ABSOLUTELY DECLINE TO GIVE. UPON WHAT GROUNDS, MAY I ASK? ALGERNON IS AN EXTREMELY, I MIGHT SAY AN OSTENTATIOUSLY ELIGIBLE YOUNG MAN. HE HAS NOTHING, BUT HE LOOKS EVERYTHING. WHAT MORE CAN ONE DESIRE? IT PAINS ME VERY MUCH TO HAVE TO SPEAK FRANKLY TO YOU, LADY BRACKNELL, ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW, BUT THE FACT IS... I DO NOT APPROVE AT ALL OF HIS MORAL CHARACTER. I SUSPECT HIM OF BEING UNTRUTHFUL. UNTRUTHFUL? MY NEPHEW ALGERNON? IMPOSSIBLE! HE IS AN OXONIAN. THIS AFTERNOON DURING MY TEMPORARY ABSENCE IN LONDON ON AN IMPORTANT QUESTION OF ROMANCE, HE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO MY HOUSE BY MEANS OF THE FALSE PRETENSE OF BEING MY BROTHER. UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME HE DRANK, I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED BY MY BUTLER, AN ENTIRE PINT BOTTLE OF MY PERRIER-JOUET BRUT '89, A WINE I WAS ESPECIALLY RESERVING FOR MYSELF. CONTINUING HIS DISGRACEFUL DECEPTION, HE SUCCEEDED IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON IN ALIENATING THE AFFECTIONS OF MY ONLY WARD. HE SUBSEQUENTLY STAYED TO TEA, AND DEVOURED EVERY SINGLE MUFFIN. WHAT MAKES HIS CONDUCT ALL THE MORE HEARTLESS IS THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE FROM THE FIRST THAT I HAVE NO BROTHER, THAT I NEVER HAD A BROTHER, AND THAT I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE A BROTHER OF ANY KIND. I DISTINCTLY TOLD HIM SO MYSELF THIS AFTERNOON. AHEM. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, MR. WORTHING, I HAVE DECIDED TO OVERLOOK MY NEPHEW'S CONDUCT TO YOU. THAT IS EXTREMELY GENEROUS OF YOU, LADY BRACKNELL. HOWEVER, MY DECISION REMAINS UNALTERABLE. I DECLINE TO GIVE MY CONSENT. SWEET CHILD, COME HERE. HOW OLD ARE YOU? WELL, I AM REALLY ONLY 18, BUT I ALWAYS ADMIT TO 20 WHEN I GO TO EVENING PARTIES. YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN MAKING SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION. NO WOMAN SHOULD EVER BE QUITE ACCURATE ABOUT HER AGE. IT LOOKS SO CALCULATING. 18, BUT ADMITTING TO 20 AT EVENING PARTIES. IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU ARE OF AGE AND FREE FROM THE RESTRAINTS OF TUTELAGE. SO I DON'T THINK YOUR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT IS AFTER ALL, A MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANCE. PRAY, EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU AGAIN, LADY BRACKNELL, BUT IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF HER GRANDFATHER'S WILL, MISS CARDEW DOES NOT COME LEGALLY OF AGE TILL SHE IS 35. THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE A GRAVE OBJECTION. 35 IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE AGE. LONDON SOCIETY IS FULL OF WOMEN OF THE VERY HIGHEST BIRTH WHO HAVE, OF THEIR OWN FREE CHOICE, REMAINED 35 FOR YEARS. LADY DUMBLETON IS AN INSTANCE IN POINT. TO MY OWN KNOWLEDGE SHE HAS BEEN 35 EVER SINCE SHE ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF 40, WHICH WAS MANY YEARS AGO NOW. I SEE NO REASON WHY OUR DEAR CECILY SHOULD NOT BE EVEN STILL MORE ATTRACTIVE AT THE AGE YOU MENTION THAN SHE IS AT PRESENT. THERE WILL BE A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF PROPERTY. ALGY, COULD YOU WAIT FOR ME TILL I WAS 35? OF COURSE I COULD, CECILY. YOU KNOW I COULD. YES, I FELT IT INSTINCTIVELY, BUT I COULDN'T WAIT ALL THAT TIME. I HATE WAITING EVEN FIVE MINUTES FOR ANYBODY. IT ALWAYS MAKES ME RATHER CROSS. I AM NOT PUNCTUAL MYSELF, BUT I DO LIKE PUNCTUALITY IN OTHERS, AND WAITING, EVEN TO BE MARRIED, IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. THEN WHAT IS TO BE DONE, CECILY? I DON'T KNOW, MR. MONCRIEFF. MY DEAR MR. WORTHING, AS MISS CARDEW STATES POSITIVELY THAT SHE CANNOT WAIT TILL SHE IS 35-- A REMARK WHICH I AM BOUND TO SAY SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW A SOMEWHAT IMPATIENT NATURE-- I WOULD BEG OF YOU TO RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION. BUT MY DEAR LADY BRACKNELL, THE MATTER IS ENTIRELY IN YOUR OWN HANDS. THE MOMENT YOU CONSENT TO MY MARRIAGE TO GWENDOLEN, I WILL MOST GLADLY ALLOW YOUR NEPHEW TO FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH MY WARD. YOU MUST BE QUITE AWARE THAT WHAT YOU PROPOSE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION? THEN A PASSIONATE CELIBACY IS ALL THAT ANY OF US CAN LOOK FORWARD TO. THAT IS NOT THE DESTINY I PROPOSE FOR GWENDOLEN. ALGERNON, OF COURSE, CAN CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF. COME, DEAR. WE HAVE ALREADY MISSED FIVE, IF NOT SIX, TRAINS. TO MISS ANY MORE MIGHT EXPOSE US TO COMMENT ON THE PLATFORM. EVERYTHING IS READY FOR THE CHRISTENINGS. THE CHRISTENINGS, SIR? IS THAT NOT SOMEWHAT PREMATURE? BOTH THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR IMMEDIATE BAPTISM. AT THEIR AGE? THE IDEA IS GROTESQUE AND IRRELIGIOUS! ALGERNON, I FORBID YOU TO BE BAPTIZED. I WILL NOT HEAR OF SUCH EXCESSES. LORD BRACKNELL WOULD BE HIGHLY DISPLEASED IF HE LEARNED THAT THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU WASTED YOUR TIME AND MONEY. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THEN THAT THERE ARE TO BE NO CHRISTENINGS AT ALL THIS AFTERNOON? I DON'T THINK THAT, AS THINGS ARE NOW, IT WOULD BE OF MUCH PRACTICAL VALUE TO EITHER OF US, DR. CHASUBLE. I AM GRIEVED TO HEAR SUCH SENTIMENTS FROM YOU, MR. WORTHING. THEY SAVOR OF THE HERETICAL VIEWS OF THE ANABAPTISTS, VIEWS THAT I HAVE COMPLETELY REFUTED IN FOUR OF MY UNPUBLISHED SERMONS. HOWEVER, AS YOUR PRESENT MOOD SEEMS TO BE ONE PECULIARLY SECULAR, I WILL RETURN TO THE CHURCH. INDEED, I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED BY THE PEW OPENER THAT FOR THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF MISS PRISM HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ME IN THE VESTRY. MISS PRISM? DID I HEAR YOU MENTION A MISS PRISM? YES, LADY BRACKNELL. I AM ON MY WAY TO JOIN HER. PRAY, ALLOW ME TO DETAIN YOU FOR A MOMENT. THIS MATTER MAY PROVE TO BE ONE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO LORD BRACKNELL AND MYSELF. IS THIS MISS PRISM A FEMALE OF REPELLENT ASPECT, REMOTELY CONNECTED WITH EDUCATION? SHE IS THE MOST CULTIVATED OF LADIES, AND THE VERY PICTURE OF RESPECTABILITY. IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME PERSON. MAY I ASK WHAT POSITION SHE HOLDS IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD? I AM A CELIBATE, MADAM. MISS PRISM, LADY BRACKNELL, HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS MISS CARDEW'S ESTEEMED GOVERNESS AND VALUED COMPANION. IN SPITE OF WHAT I HEAR OF HER, I MUST SEE HER AT ONCE. - LET HER BE SENT FOR. - SHE APPROACHES. SHE IS NIGH. I WAS TOLD YOU EXPECTED ME IN THE VESTRY, DEAR CANON. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU FOR AN HOUR AND THREE-QUARTERS. PRISM! COME HERE, PRISM. PRISM, WHERE IS THAT BABY? 28 YEARS AGO, PRISM, YOU LEFT LORD BRACKNELL'S HOUSE, NUMBER 104, GROSVENOR SQUARE, IN CHARGE OF A PERAMBULATOR THAT CONTAINED A BABY OF THE MALE SEX. YOU NEVER RETURNED. A FEW WEEKS LATER, THROUGH THE ELABORATE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, THE PERAMBULATOR WAS DISCOVERED AT MIDNIGHT STANDING BY ITSELF IN A REMOTE CORNER OF BAYSWATER. IT CONTAINED THE MANUSCRIPT OF A THREE-VOLUME NOVEL OF MORE THAN USUALLY REVOLTING SENTIMENTALITY, BUT THE BABY WAS NOT THERE. PRISM, WHERE IS THAT BABY? LADY BRACKNELL, I ADMIT WITH SHAME THAT I DO NOT KNOW. I ONLY WISH I DID. THE PLAIN FACTS OF THE CASE ARE THESE: ON THE MORNING OF THE DAY YOU MENTION, A DAY THAT IS FOREVER BRANDED ON MY MEMORY, I PREPARED AS USUAL TO TAKE THE BABY OUT IN ITS PERAMBULATOR. I HAD ALSO WITH ME A SOMEWHAT OLD, BUT CAPACIOUS HANDBAG, IN WHICH I HAD INTENDED TO PLACE THE MANUSCRIPT OF A WORK OF FICTION THAT I HAD WRITTEN DURING MY FEW UNOCCUPIED HOURS. IN A MOMENT OF MENTAL ABSTRACTION, FOR WHICH I NEVER CAN FORGIVE MYSELF, I DEPOSITED THE MANUSCRIPT IN THE BASINETTE, AND PLACED THE BABY IN THE HANDBAG. WHERE DID YOU DEPOSIT THE HANDBAG? DO NOT ASK ME, MR. WORTHING. MISS PRISM, THIS IS A MATTER OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE TO ME. I INSIST ON KNOWING WHERE YOU DEPOSITED THE HANDBAG THAT CONTAINED THAT INFANT. I LEFT IT IN THE CLOAKROOM OF ONE OF THE LARGER RAILWAY STATIONS IN LONDON. WHAT RAILWAY STATION? VICTORIA... THE BRIGHTON LINE. I MUST RETIRE TO MY ROOM FOR A MOMENT. GWENDOLEN, WAIT HERE FOR ME. IF YOU ARE NOT TOO LONG, I WILL WAIT FOR YOU ALL MY LIFE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS, LADY BRACKNELL? I DARE NOT EVEN SUSPECT, DR. CHASUBLE. I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT IN FAMILIES OF HIGH POSITION STRANGE COINCIDENCES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO OCCUR. THEY ARE HARDLY CONSIDERED THE THING. ( thrashing above ) UNCLE JACK SEEMS STRANGELY AGITATED. YOUR GUARDIAN HAS A VERY EMOTIONAL NATURE. THIS NOISE IS EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT. IT SOUNDS AS IF HE WAS HAVING AN ARGUMENT. I DISLIKE ARGUMENTS OF ANY KIND. THEY ARE ALWAYS VULGAR, AND OFTEN CONVINCING. IT HAS STOPPED NOW. ( thrashing ) I WISH HE WOULD ARRIVE AT SOME CONCLUSION. THIS SUSPENSE IS TERRIBLE. I HOPE IT WILL LAST. IS THIS THE BAG, MISS PRISM? EXAMINE IT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU SPEAK. THE HAPPINESS OF MORE THAN ONE LIFE DEPENDS ON YOUR ANSWER. IT SEEMS TO BE MINE. YES-- HERE IS THE INJURY IT RECEIVED THROUGH THE UPSETTING OF A GOWER STREET OMNIBUS IN YOUNGER AND HAPPIER DAYS. HERE IS THE STAIN ON THE LINING CAUSED BY THE EXPLOSION OF A TEMPERANCE BEVERAGE, AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT LEAMINGTON. AND HERE, ON THE LOCK, ARE MY INITIALS. I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT IN AN EXTRAVAGANT MOOD I HAD PLACED THEM THERE. THE BAG IS UNDOUBTEDLY MINE. I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE IT SO UNEXPECTEDLY RESTORED TO ME. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE BEING WITHOUT IT ALL THESE YEARS. MISS PRISM, MORE TO YOU IS RESTORED THAN THIS HANDBAG. I WAS THE BABY YOU PLACED IN IT. YOU? - YES-- MOTHER! - MR. WORTHING, I AM UNMARRIED! UNMARRIED? I DO NOT DENY, THAT IS A SERIOUS BLOW, BUT AFTER ALL, WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO CAST A STONE AGAINST ONE WHO HAS SUFFERED? CANNOT REPENTANCE WIPE OUT AN ACT OF FOLLY? WHY SHOULD THERE BE ONE LAW FOR MEN, AND ONE FOR WOMEN? MOTHER, I FORGIVE YOU. MR. WORTHING, THERE IS SOME ERROR. THERE IS THE LADY WHO CAN TELL YOU WHO YOU REALLY ARE. LADY BRACKNELL, I HATE TO SEEM INQUISITIVE... BUT WOULD YOU KINDLY INFORM ME WHO I AM? I AM AFRAID THE NEWS I HAVE TO GIVE YOU WILL NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASE YOU. YOU ARE THE SON OF MY POOR SISTER, MRS. MONCRIEFF... AND CONSEQUENTLY, ALGERNON'S ELDER BROTHER. ALGERNON'S ELDER BROTHER? ALGERNON'S ELDER BROTHER? THEN I HAVE A BROTHER AFTER ALL! I ALWAYS SAID I HAD A BROTHER! I KNEW I HAD A BROTHER! CECILY, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DOUBTED I HAD A BROTHER? DR. CHASUBLE, MY UNFORTUNATE BROTHER! MISS PRISM, MY UNFORTUNATE BROTHER! GWENDOLEN, MY UNFORTUNATE BROTHER! ALGY, YOU WILL HAVE TO TREAT ME WITH MORE RESPECT IN THE FUTURE. YOU HAVE NEVER BEHAVED TO ME LIKE A BROTHER IN ALL YOUR LIFE. NOT TILL TODAY, OLD BOY, I ADMIT. HOWEVER, I DID MY BEST, THOUGH I WAS OUT OF PRACTICE. MY OWN! BUT WHAT OWN ARE YOU? WHAT IS YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME, NOW THAT YOU HAVE BECOME SOMEONE ELSE? I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT POINT. YOUR DECISION ON THE SUBJECT OF MY NAME IS IRREVOCABLE, I SUPPOSE? I NEVER CHANGE, EXCEPT IN MY AFFECTIONS. WHAT A NOBLE NATURE YOU HAVE, GWENDOLEN! THEN THE QUESTION HAD BETTER BE CLEARED UP AT ONCE. AUNT AUGUSTA? A MOMENT. AT THE TIME WHEN MISS PRISM LEFT ME IN THE HANDBAG, HAD I BEEN CHRISTENED ALREADY? EVERY LUXURY THAT MONEY COULD BUY, INCLUDING CHRISTENING, HAD BEEN LAVISHED ON YOU BY YOUR FOND AND DOTING PARENTS. THEN I HAD BEEN CHRISTENED! THAT IS SETTLED NOW. WHAT NAME WAS I GIVEN? LET ME KNOW THE WORST. BEING THE ELDEST SON YOU WERE NATURALLY CHRISTENED AFTER YOUR FATHER. YES...? WHAT WAS MY FATHER'S CHRISTIAN NAME? I CANNOT AT THE MOMENT RECALL WHAT THE GENERAL'S CHRISTIAN NAME WAS. I HAVE NO DOUBT HE HAD ONE. HE WAS ECCENTRIC, I ADMIT. BUT ONLY IN LATER YEARS. AND THAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE INDIAN CLIMATE, AND MARRIAGE, AND INDIGESTION, AND OTHER THINGS OF THAT KIND. ALGY, CAN'T YOU RECOLLECT WHAT OUR FATHER'S CHRISTIAN NAME WAS? MY DEAR BOY, WE WEREN'T EVEN ON SPEAKING TERMS. HE DIED BEFORE I WAS A YEAR OLD. MISS-- HIS NAME WOULD APPEAR IN THE ARMY LISTS OF THE PERIOD, I SUPPOSE, AUNT AUGUSTA? THE GENERAL WAS ESSENTIALLY A MAN OF PEACE, EXCEPT IN HIS DOMESTIC LIFE. BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT HIS NAME WOULD APPEAR IN ANY MILITARY DIRECTORY. THE ARMY LISTS OF THE LAST 40 YEARS ARE HERE. THESE DELIGHTFUL RECORDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY CONSTANT STUDY. "M: GENERALS... "MALLAM," "MAXBOHM, "MAGLEY"-- WHAT GHASTLY NAMES THEY HAVE-- "MARKBY," "MIGSBY," "MOBBS"... "MONCRIEFF." "LIEUTENANT 1840... CAPTAIN... LIEUTENANT-COLONEL, COLONEL... GENERAL... 1869... CHRISTIAN NAMES, ERNEST JOHN." I ALWAYS TOLD YOU, GWENDOLEN, MY NAME WAS ERNEST, DIDN'T I? WELL, IT IS ERNEST AFTER ALL. IT NATURALLY IS ERNEST. YES, I REMEMBER NOW THAT THE GENERAL WAS CALLED ERNEST. I KNEW I HAD SOME PARTICULAR REASON FOR DISLIKING THE NAME. ERNEST! MY OWN ERNEST! I FELT FROM THE FIRST YOU COULD HAVE NO OTHER NAME. IT IS A TERRIBLE THING FOR A MAN TO FIND OUT SUDDENLY THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? I CAN, FOR I FEEL THAT YOU ARE SURE TO CHANGE. MY OWN ONE! Dr. Chasuble: I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH WAS IN ERROR ON CERTAIN POINTS. MISS PRISM-- LAETITIA, I BEG TO SOLICIT THE HONOR OF YOUR HAND. FREDERICK--! AT LAST! CECILY, AT LAST! GWENDOLEN, AT LAST! MY NEPHEW... YOU SEEM TO BE DISPLAYING SIGNS OF TRIVIALITY. ON THE CONTRARY, AUNT AUGUSTA. I'VE NOW REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST. ( theme music playing )
