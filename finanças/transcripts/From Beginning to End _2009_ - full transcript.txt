I was born with my eyes wide shut. Sure, everybody is born with their eyes closed. But mine were closed so tight, they formed wrinkles. I remained with my eyes closed for more than 2 weeks. My mother, contrary to expectations... didn't worry. She always said that when I was prepared... and when I was ready, I would open my eyes. It was like this, in the very first days of my life... I learned the true meaning of free will. Francisco was used to that ritual... but that day was different. While he stared at me... through the thick, soundproof nursery glass window... I without any reason... opened my eyes, and looked straight into his. Do you think it can swim? - No! - I fooled you! - I'm gonna throw him down! - No! Take the slippers off. Do you want it? - What's his name? - Basta! What a ridiculous name for a stuffed dog. - Mommy chose it. - She was messing with you. She told me it was an "appropriate" name. It's "appropriate", Thomés! Come get me! - Give me my dog back! - No way! You two straight to the shower! Lunch will be served in 15 minutes. Rosa, take my dog away from him! She can't. I'm faster than her. - No you're not! - Yes I am. And you won't catch me either! Look at this ugly dog! - Give it back! - Come and get it! Dad, get the dog from him! You two are making a mess. "FROM BEGINNING TO END" Thanks for the cheese quiches, Rosa. Besides all of you... Rosa's cheese quiche is the thing I like most. Really? Alexandre said that the more you like coffee... the more you like sex. I'm not the one who says it. It's scientific. - Really, Alexandre? - Really. And how is that, Alexandre? - Thomés, I am your father. - I know, Alexandre. I have to go to the construction site. Just another minute darling; The boys haven't finished eating. Eat one more quiche. Quiche! Quiche! Look at your brother swimming. When I grow up I will swim as well as you. I'll think about that. What do you mean? I'll see if I will let you. I do anything my brother wants... but first you have to learn one thing. - What? - To breathe underwater. - No! No! - Can you do it? Boys! You are taking a long time in the bath. Take it easy, Rosa. Yeah, take it easy, Rosinha. Who is responsible for the mess in the bathroom? - Not me! - Not me! - And who is lying? - Me. Two minutes to leave the shower! - Take it! - Don't use that on my hair! You're wasting it. Stop it! You're making a mess! I'm gonna throw it all over you! There, now you can sleep like a baby. I am not a baby. Fine, but you can sleep like one. I have to exercise. - But I want to watch. - So keep quiet. Take this! Who told you to mess with my backpack? Jerk. Pile of shit. "Jerk, pile of shit"? You know what I'll do to you? Stop screaming! Stop it! - Mom! - Stop it! - You know what I'll do to you? - No! Stop screaming. Antonio Carlos called to tell me the details... of how "our president" left the government palace. Really? And how did it go? He said he was in the room when Collor asked the helicopter's pilot... to fly above Brasilia for the last time... - before dropping him off at his house. - And? And that the pilot answered he had strict orders... to take him straight to his house. Well done! Darling, I've never heard you speak like this. - No? - No. But now you have. How sexy. You think? Do you like to watch? You like to watch. Did you forget anything? NO, I didn't. Look at this! Look! Look! Your little friends are here. Why don't they sing? Do you think they're deaf and dumb like I was blind? Some birds don't sing. And you were never blind... you just didn't want to open your eyes. I think I remember. Impossible. Nobody remembers when they were one month old. - I remember. - Impossible! I remember. Period. It's time to go to school. Goodbye, boy. Rosa, you won't let anyone put us in a cage, right? - I won't let it happen. - Me neither. Think fast! Let's go, Julieta! I'm coming, darling. Go get the car. Let me give a little kiss on my two beautiful boys. Thomés doesn't want to go to the swimming lessons. Swimming is the best exercise for your health. I'm going, I was just messing with Rosa. They say that the happiest people are the ones who do not need to make history. The ones that make history, only emphasize... the struggle for life through their doings... that eternal conflict. Many years later I understood that day. My mother and father were happy. Francisco and I too. Hello? Doctor Julieta, it's for you. - It's from your sons' school. - Thank you. Hello. Yes. Can you bring them to the hospital? Thanks, Elaine, I will be waiting for you. Thank you, Ana. He broke the tibia. But it looks discreet. See? - But we'll have to put a cast on it. - Is it going to hurt? No, I'll give him a medicine, the pain will go away... and the cast doesn't hurt. I'll take good care of him. - Thank you, Arthur. - No problem. Didn't you say you wanted to have a cast? Now you got it. Now let me look at Torn Torn. - Oh my... - Is it bleeding a lot'? No, you're almost good. Thank you. - I don't like blood. - I know. Mommy will put a bandage, and you'll be alright. Is there going to be a scar? No, there will be no scar, sweetie. - You promise? - I promise. What happened? It was during the break. The other boys... - Fight? - Yes. Thank you for your kindness, Elaine. I'm sorry for this. I have to see another patient. I'll take them home afterward. Ok. Bye, Julieta, bye, kids. Mommy will see another patient... and you'll stay quietly here. Claudia will be with you... that nurse you two like. Ok? - I'll take care of him. - You'd better. Take care. It belongs to mommy. Here, can you hear? - Yes. - It's my heart. Can you hear it well? Let me hear. Place it in my heart. You scared me! Here, listen to my heart. - Can you hear it? - Yes. It's strong. - It's right here, isn't it? - Yeah. How is my firstborn? I wish I could take this cast off soon. It's itching a lot. Only a few days more. Is it getting annoying? Now it is. But at first it was fun! That's the way it is in life. Everything has two sides. What do you mean? The good side and... the other. - Is everything like this? - Almost. Sometimes we choose if we pay more attention to the good side... - or to the other side. - Can we do it? Yes we can, but we don't always manage to do it. I don't understand. If we can choose the good side why would we choose the other one? It's true. It's hard to understand... hard to explain... And sometimes hard to identify. Is your brother taking good care of you? He said he wants to be a doctor just like you. Is there something you would like to tell me? What do you mean? I don't know. Maybe something you don't understand very well. Something from the school? Not exactly. Something about you and your brother... about things of life. If someday you feel like talking to me... If there's anything you don't understand... you don't need to be ashamed. Ok? I know, morn. And I love you a lot. I love you too. - How lovely. - It's a gift from me... - To me? - To Pedro. You always liked Pedro. Always. You could have been happy together. Maybe, but you two were happy too. That's true. We were. - And I'm older than him. - But you don't show. Well, I'm older than Alexandre. But you don't show. It's different. Different times, things were different. When I was exiled he followed me. Maybe if I had come back with him. But then you wouldn't have met, and we wouldn't have met either. It's true. Back then I should have married you. Well, we are sort of married anyway... Julieta, let's go. We are very late. The plane isn't going to wait. I'm coming, darling. Go get the car! Call Fabinho and tell him we are a bit late. We're just waiting for your morn. She's always late. Look, it's Fabinho! Great. You just need the passports. - Hi. - What would we do without you? - My pleasure. - Thank you. - Where is it? - Let's go? - Do you want to sit there? - Ok. - Please. - There we go! We're going to Buenos Aires! Let's go! We have arrived. Lucrecia, the kids are here. This is Thomas, the youngest. You look like your father. She said I look like my father. - Me too. - You look just like mother. I look just like your father. Let's go to my office. - Do you speak English? - It's Spanish. - Do you speak it? - Of course. How good to be at home. Let's go. What will it be? The mysterious gift. You're the only one who knows. Look! A book. What a beautiful book. These are books we read throughout life. The type we use for research. It's the world's history. You can read it too. You're going to take a long time to read that. And where is Torn Tom's gift? I forgot. I'm sorry. No! What is it? Thomés' gift. Francisco always made sure I was happy. As happy as possible, of course. That was the first time we went together to Buenos Aires. Merry Christmas, dad. Let's go in there. Here? This is a cemetery. I know. It's where they put people when they die. I don't want to go in. Me neither. You are here to spend Christmas: A celebration of life, the birth of Jesus. Do you think they put Jesus there? No, he resurrected! Francisco, tell me what that is. I don't know. Do you know, Lucrecia? Well... I also don't know. Did you choose something, Torn Torn? I don't know how to read English. Let me pick for you. Do you want an ice cream? - Vanilla. - Chocolate. - Vanilla. - Chocolate. Vanilla! Chocolate for you and vanilla for me. Do you know everyone? Almost. See that one? He's my cousin. Of course I miss you. I miss you too. Thomés looks just like you. Alexandre says the same thing. But I think he looks more like him. A big kiss, darling. Merry Christmas to you and Alexandre. - Merry Christmas to you all. - Ok, bye. - Hi, morn. - Hello, sweetie. How are you? We are fine. Has the party started yet? - It's starting now. - Here too, it's just started. Merry Christmas, Francisco. I love you, sweetheart. I love you too, morn. Let me speak with your brother. Big kiss, morn. - Another for you. - Bye. She wants to talk to you. Mira, Que Rico. No. Francisco's papa es El Rico. He has much money. Plata! Yes, plata. Merry Christmas, Torn Torn. I love you, son. Your father wants to talk to you. Kisses. So my son learned to speak Spanish? Si, papa. And I got a lot of gifts. There are gifts for you here too. Daddy said there are gifts for us there too. Merry Christmas son, I love you. Give your brother a kiss. They've been here for a few days and they are speaking Spanish fluently. Now they are really speaking English, right? Yes they are. Do you know what they said? That you speak Spanish very well. I also know how to do math. Want to see? Yes. Two kisses plus two kisses... 4 kisses. One. - Good. - Two. Three, four. Do you want to see another one? A weenie plus another weenie... equals a little weenie, plus a big weenie. You look beautiful, as always. - Welcome. - Thank you. It has been a long time. It's been two years since I last saw you. That's the advantage of having an ex-husband living in another country. In our case, it's a disadvantage. - We always got along very well. - That's true. That was only one of those clichés that applies to divorced couples. But in our case clichés do not apply. - Want to sit down? - Of course. I was distracted by your beauty. What were you going to say? I once said to myself... I was going to change the world and I would have you forever. I failed in both things. Darling... Rosa! Rosa, you haven't changed. Neither have you. As charming as ever. He is an Argentinean... Porteno. May I? - Of course. How are you Pedro? - I'm happy to be here with you. - Was Christmas good? - Great. So... - Let's toast. - Ok. - To happiness. - To happiness. Excuse me now, I will be back later. To your children. To our children. By the way, how did the boys behave in Buenos Aires? Very well... they made an excellent impression and delighted everyone. They are very sweet. But, speaking of them, have you noticed they are very close? Of course I noticed. They live with me. But I mean something else. Maybe too close? "Too close"? What are you trying to say exactly? Well, Julieta... Say it, Pedro. Too intimate. "Too intimate"? Doesn't it worry you they might start sexualizing their relationship? I don't know exactly what is happening to them... but they are very young. These things happen at that age. Don't you think we should talk to them? I don't know what they are doing exactly... or what they will do. But we cannot tell them it is a bad thing. Don't you think? So, you are not worried? I am. Didn't I tell you not to play with my paints? Who told you to mess with my working tools? It was nothing, dad. Let go of him! Don't you ever do it again! - He is my son! - And he is my brother. - He deserved it. - It doesn't matter. From now on I'm the one who will take care of him. Forever. Let's go, Thomés. - Did you...? - I saw. I lost control. I don't know how to deal with this. I know, darling... Is it really forever? Forever. Hey. Look at me. Stop screaming! Stop screaming! - Does it tickle'? - It does. A lot! Just don't pee. Don't pee. Months later, when Pedro died... I realized nothing is forever... as Francisco had told me. Fifteen years later, when mom died... I was sure the permanence of things... does not depend only upon our will. There is something greater, mysterious, unreachable. Which determines the calendar of our days. My mom's absence... was a feeling I didn't know yet... I didn't know it existed. A secret revealed about destiny. Therefore, there was no point... in questioning why she disappeared so suddenly. Somehow that knowledge... touched us in a surprisingly liberating way. What remained was the love and the longing. I love you. And why do you love me? I love you because you're mine. I love you because you need love. I love you because when you look at me I feel like a hero. It was always like that. I love you because when I touch you, I feel more a man... than any other man. I love you too. And why do you love me too? I love you because when I touch you... I make you feel more a man than any other man. I love you because nobody could ever accuse us of love. I love you because to understand our love... they'd need to turn the world upside down. I love you because you could love somebody else... yet still you love me. Just me. Just you. Just you. Change the song, Thomés. - What? - Change the song. - Can't hear you. - Change the song! See what you have done? Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy, it won't even need stitches. Change the song. Is it better? Go on. Change it. Ok, I'll change. Appropriate. Hey! Ivan was trying to persuade me to swim again. Of course, you always swam so well. I'm serious. You could compete again. You just have to start training again. MY biggest fan. I'm your biggest fan. - Let's go? - Let's go. Did you get tired? We used to come here with Alexandre every Saturday. When we were kids. On Sundays, we went to the ballet with mother. Remember? Alexandre didn't like the ballet... and mother didn't like the horse races. Besides that, they got along very well. And you get along very well, right? Yes... Sometimes I get a little jealous. I know how it is. - What? - To be jealous. What do you mean? Jealousy. But is it adjective or noun? - What? - Jealous or jealousy? Both, whatever. Whatever? And who were you jealous of? Of you, of course. When did I ever give you a reason to be jealous? To begin with, we don't need a reason to be jealous. But there was a time when I was 11, 12 years old... You were 5 or 6... that I was jealous for real. Precocious. You're not going to tell that story again, are you? - I am. - No, you're not. - I missed the joke. - She was my first teacher. - I fainted at school... - Because of her. - I ended up in the doctor. - Who gave you a lot of medicine. I like medicine. And I like doctors. You convinced me you were in love with the teacher. It was possible. You know, I was very young... I think I was a little confused. At that age who isn't sexually confused? Look at Ivan. I think we are exaggerating with our intimacies. - Are you uncomfortable, Ivan? - Of course not. - But I wanted to ask you a question. - Do it. You have never been apart from each other, have you? A few times. Only when I was competing and you were working. Yeah. Why? Because Thomés got an invitation to train for the Olympics. He's lying. Look at him. That is wonderful. - He's joking. - Why do you look worried? In Russia. What do you mean, Russia? To train in Russia. No. I'm not going. I'm not going. Wait, wait. I think I understand what Ivan said... but I got a little nervous and ended up creating this mood. I understood, but I don't want to go. - Let's talk calmly. - I imagined this situation. But I couldn't keep it from you. After all, the invitation was for you. For how long? Well, the idea is to train there until the Olympic Games. Three years. Wait a minute guys. I don't need to go to Russia. I have the best coach here. But it's not just the coach. It's the training conditions. I know but... Thomés, this isn't the right time to talk. You're right. Congratulations. What do you want? I don't want to go. Thomés, then it's settled. It's not that easy. I know. I'm sorry. Francisco thinks I must go. We talked about it all night long. What do you think? Son, I am very proud of you. This would be great for you professionally speaking. But I sincerely don't know what to say. So what do I do? That is an issue you two will have to resolve alone. But I will support any decision. Ok? Why did you move? Because it was the right time for you to live by yourselves. I know, but what I asked was why did you move? You should have stayed and we should have left. It didn't make sense for me... to continue living there without your mother. Anyway, the house is very well taken care of. Thank you, dad. "Forgive me, Cordélia" but apart from you, my beautiful sister, I had never had any desire for any woman. But I always like to be sucked. So, I sometimes seduce some rose lips. But, the phallus inside the rose, in women, only 'in extremis'. There's in all of them a laziness that discourages me. I like hard and slim bodies, with hard buttocks still unseasoned, glued together. I like men's assholes, virile, with some hair around it, an opening and closing full of attitude... Woman's asses make good beef, should there be a plane crash in the snow. Have you read about those who ate their frozen friends? Going back to the ass... Yours. Golden and fresh. You were the only one. Your ass was the only one. Firm, high, perfect as boys'! "Don't look like that and don't laugh." Don't tickle! Don't move, I'll be right back. - Ox? - Ok. Cheers. Why the celebration? Give me your right hand. I wouldn't let you go away without a wedding ring. Don't you think you put it on the wrong hand? Let's go by the ritual. First on the right hand, then we change it. And where is the one I'm putting on your finger? Don't think I'm leaving before giving you one too. It's here. Give me your right hand. Just one more thing. - What's this? - Open it. Do you like it? - I like it. - Good, right? - Beautiful, aren't they? - Who? Who? The Argentineans. A mi me gush. I just don't get the joke. - It's legitimate. - To whom? - You're jealous? - It's not jealousy. I just didn't find it appropriate. What? What you said about the Argentineans. You don't get it. You are Argentinean. You're my Argentinean. But admit that they are very good looking. Let's dance. In your dreams. But what kind of Argentinean are you? - The fake kind. - Let's go... Dance with me? Fine. Being able to surrender to someone else... ls the best thing in life. True love starts then, in this unconditional giving. Personal life is only worth it when you believe. It was like that for me and Francisco. Good morning, Torn Torn. I was anxious to talk to you. You could have called me. I didn't want to wake you up. You know I like it when you wake me up. That's when we're sleeping together. Right? I like it anyway. Anyway, I wasn't sleeping. I know, I got confused. Since you've been gone, I get confused all the time. I miss you so much. Me too. Install a camera on your computer. At least we can see each other. I'm seeing you right now. And you look more beautiful than ever. I look horrible, consumed by your absence. No, you're not. Put a camera on this computer; At least we could... I won't stand making love through a computer. But when I hear your voice I get excited. And how do you think I am? I don't know. Show me how you are. Thomés, don't do that to me. Show it to me. Show what? - Is it very cold? - Very. I wish I was there with you. Boys, I saw that you were online and could not resist. Hi dad, I miss you! I miss you too, son. - And Francisco too. - What do you mean? Well... I haven't seen you since Thomés left. You must be kidding. You sound like an old father. I am saying this because I really miss you two. I miss my children, and since you are here Francisco... you could give me a little more attention. I haven't had the time. Come on, Francisco. What have you been doing? I'm partying. Don't take seriously the complaints of a lonely father. You are not going to argue because of me. It is not because of you, Alex. Thomés must be jealous. There you go again with this jealousy talk. If you continue like this, I will start to believe it. I am going to hang up. This is not a conversation for three. Stay online dad. Is there any reason why I should be jealous? I am only kidding. Look, I must hang up; I have to go to the club. But it's Sunday there. You train on Sundays too? Of course, clad. This is Russia. That's why he went there. Yes. That is why you sent me here. I think I upset you, Torn Torn. No. Forget about it. I exaggerated. I'm sorry. I think it's because I miss you very much. Shall we have lunch tomorrow, Francisco? - Here or there? - We can meet at the bistro, at 1PM. I want to go too. Thomés, I love you. I miss you, son. I love you too, dad. Good evening. I'm sorry. I'm going to turn it down. I'm sorry I woke you up. Good night. Good night. The neighbors again. But you are not even playing it very loud. But they threatened to call the police. Man. Neighbors are always like that. We have a dog for four years... and there are neighbors who still complain to this day. - Who are we? - What? You said, "We have a dog". Who do you live with? With Thomés. And who is Thomés? My brother. Only the two of you? And the dog, Basta. - Basta what? - Basta is the dog. Wait, I'm confused. What are you talking about? The dog's name is Basta. I didn't understand. Well, I have to go. I must be at the practice at 9AM. - What kind of practice? - General Practice. So you are a doctor? - I am. - I love doctors. Don't be embarrassed. She has such a fire! What do you mean, Fabio? Man. Goodbye. Bye. I'll take you to the door. - He's mine. - Why? What do you mean? Because I liked him. I'm under the impression that he has someone. Then that someone has a problem, because he's mine. How confident! Hi, Bianca, how are you? Shall we meet at the weekend? I've been going out a lot and I have to work tomorrow. I enjoyed it too. Let's do it. So I will call you on Saturday. Ok? Right. Ok. Bye. Stay there. You look tired and have dark circles under your eyes. I have been going out a bit too much. - Do you want to talk about this? - Not now. Look, everything is all right. I am a little lost. I just miss Thomés a lot. I can imagine. Don't worry, I am not doing anything bad. Whenever you need to talk, you know you can count on me. You spoke like my mother now. Really? - I learned with her. - What? Things of life. You also miss her a lot, don't you? A lot. - Hi. Am I too early? - You are right on time. Excuse me. Nice house. I have always lived here. - Really? Since you were born? - Practically. Can I put it here? Sure. Beautiful. - Is that your mother? - Yeah. - She's very pretty. - Thank you. Where does she live? She died not very long ago. - I am very sorry. - It's Ok. And your father? That's him. He's also handsome. He also died. I was 12 years old. And this is probably your brother. That's Thomés. You look happier now talking about him. Maybe it's because he is still alive. How awful. And where is he? - He's living abroad. - Really? Where? - What? - What is he doing? He is a swimmer. He's training. - Cool. - Yes, cool. What would you like to listen to? What do you want to drink? - Have you got gin? - Yes. I do. So I'll have a dry martini. Do you know how to prepare one? Of course. It is Alex's favorite drink. Who is Alex? My stepfather. My mom's second husband. - Did he die too? - No, he... Do you want to listen to music? I do. I want to listen to something romantic. Like what? Like a film theme. Hey, hey! Take it easy. I like it rough but you're hurting me. I'm really sorry. That was not my intention. Ok, calm down. It wasn't that bad. - Are you Ok? - Yes, I'm Ok. - What happened? - Nothing, it's Ok. I think it's the lack of habit. - Of drinking? - Yes. I don't really drink very much. I haven't noticed. It is a wedding ring, right? Yes. I shouldn't. Yes, you shouldn't... But you don't need to feel that guilty. It was only a kiss. - Only a kiss. - Yes. It was only a kiss. Yes. Your brother is beautiful. I don't know who is more beautiful. You are beautiful too. Thank you. I know. So... - So... Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Good night. - Good night. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: Oh, no! It is an ever fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wondering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks, Within his bending sickle's compass come; If this be error, and upon me prov'd, I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd. Where were you going? TO MY PARENTS
