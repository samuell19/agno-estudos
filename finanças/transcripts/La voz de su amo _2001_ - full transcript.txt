HIS MASTER'S VOICE In 1980, the bloodiest in ETA's history, the terrorist group caused hundreds of deaths in attacks primarily in the Navarra region and the Basque Country. This is the background of our story, though the story is itself fictional. Police officer Jos? Manuel Jim?nez, 32, from Almer?a, was killed today by a bomb planted under his car. The terrorists have not yet been identified. His body was trapped in the wreckage. In the last 48 hours in the Basque Country, three more people have been killed, apart from the three policemen killed on Thursday. Neither of the two branches of ETA seem to have committed Thursday's murders. The "Autonomous Commandos" seem to be responsible. Yesterday's victims were an industrialist and two Civil Guards. Also, an executive from the Vitoria Michelin plant was shot and wounded by two men. Besides this early morning attack, there was another later on. Justo Mendiz?bal, 44, owner of a garage, was killed at his work by three men. His neighbors say Justo had lived in Arrona his whole life and had no known political ideas. He and his family... - Excuse me. - Yes? Can I go upstairs? Sure. All the rooms are free. You won't charge me for taking photos? - Photos of what? - Seagulls. I'm an ornithologist. You don't look like one. But I don't really know what ornithologists look like. I'll call up. Pick any room you like. Hello. Which would you like? The one at the end is the only one that's not free. The one next door, then. Charli. Charli, it's me, Katy. Sorry. You poor man, I hit you hard. I was scared, we've had burglaries. Fuck, Katy, that hurt. How could I know it was you? Wait, let me see. You're bleeding. We'll have to disinfect it. Cesar gave you the key? He wouldn't want to share me with you. Mr. Oliveira wouldn't share you with anyone. Cesar doesn't have to know everything I do, though. That's why he has me. I saw you at the hotel. Well, well, Charli. Following me? - Who is he? - Does it matter? Yes, it does, after what I saw... What did you see, Peeping Tom? Cold... Cold... Cold... Freezing... Freezing... Cold... Warm... Warmer... Burning hot, Charli. See? You got burned. What passion, Charli! I almost thought - you wanted something else. - How long? Charli, do you really care? Do I care? Why the hell I am here? You're such a good person. Give me a smoke. And that cigar? Another boyfriend? Was he here when I arrived? That's none of your business. You'll tell? Of course. It's what you're paid for. And you're paid to fuck. He's the boss. He's nothing, he's a fake. You're the shadow of a fake. What's up? - You're not expecting dinner? - I didn't say anything. I bet he hasn't eaten at all today. What's up, Salva? The soccer player! You working? - I fell asleep. - I saw that. I've been at it since 7:00 AM. - Will they finish soon? - Who knows? How's the Portuguese guy? Behaving himself. What's wrong? The fucking photos. They were here. - Don't leave that there. - Fine. Knock it off! I remember how I had to convince you to invest. To be the first. For seven years, we've benefited a lot from my insistence. Am I wrong, Santiago? Now we're having a cash flow problem, and some of us think it's time to retreat. But I believe we have to face up to our small investors. If we show them our face, they'll slap it. In a few months, confidence might begin to grow again. I don't know. This is like gambling, you have to know when to fold. You should know that well, Cesar. We've had months without new investors. Without investors, there's no benefits. This isn't profitable. What's profitable for me is to pack my bags and go. If you were prudent, you'd do the same. Charli, you're here. Good evening. The poor girl's fallen asleep. How did it go? Come with me. Was she with that guy? She was with two. And the guy from the newsstand. The newsstand? Does she do it with all three at once or individually? Only with one in a hotel. The newsstand guy? He's not important. - He wrote down something for her. - The third? He was at her place when I arrived. I said follow her, not talk to her. Yeah, but it's Katy. I feel for her. I got the papers from her lover's car. You're so efficient. Hilario Montesinos... He must be younger. No, your age. But that doesn't matter. Katy likes heroin more than men. - Drugs... - From Montesinos. She always needed money. That explains it. Shit, I always forget. - Give this to Zurbano's bodyguard... - Salva. Tell him not to let go of it until they're somewhere safe. I've forgotten about Katy and her friend. Do the same. What's up? You're so weird, always alone in a corner. It's late for you. Charli, come over here. Come on. What for? Come closer. Now what? Pick me up. Like you used to. I weigh nothing. - Thanks, darling. - "Darling"? Yes. They're leaving. Come on. Put me on the bed. Bedtime. Well? Any other whims? - You know you're very handsome? - Am I? You're such a brute. What are you doing, kid? Hey, silly. Don't think you're too old for me. I'm almost as tall as you. Almost. - Marta... - What? Take that hand away, Marta. My God! It blew up when they left. I saw it from upstairs. - It's their trademark. - Fuck... Who was guarding the cars? Why did they choose Zurbano? Oliveira didn't say anything? He doesn't know anything. He would have told me. I'm sorry I failed you, Mr. Oliveira. What? No. My job's to keep these things from happening. These things happen here constantly, though you never expect it. But it's dangerous for Marta to be at my side. - What do you say? - You both should go. I need more time. If her mother were alive, I'd send them away. Marta could go stay at your place. No one would suspect that. What does she say? Marta? She adores you. She'll love the idea. She'll have to leave school, but that's no problem. Well? Whatever you say. You're the only person I trust. Is this it? It's nicer inside. It's cool. I like apartments. Sorry about the mess... Hell, man, it's awesome. I'll change the sheets. I'll sleep in there. No, I won't throw you out of your bed. I'll sleep in there. Charli! Goddamnit, the oil! Fuck! I'm an asshole, I forgot about it! Did you know him? Why? He must have done something. "He must have done something?" No, Charli, don't... Repeat that, you son of a bitch! Repeat it! Carlos kicks the first ball. He used to play here. Try to play as well as him. Hey, look who's there! l?aki! I'm glad to see you! Been on vacation? - More or less. - You look great. So do you. How's your mom? - Come see her with me. - Great. Hi, Mom. Carlos, son! I forgot you were coming. This head of mine... How are you, Carmen? Don't you remember me? I'm l?aki. My friend l?aki, Mom. - l?aki... - Let's go inside. How are you? Fine. You'll stay for lunch, right? You haven't eaten? I don't know. It's late, you must have. That's all right... You can't go on like this. Come live with me. Why, Carlos? I'm fine. Let's eat. What food have you got? The store must have delivered something. I'll make the food. I appreciate that... l?aki? Marta! This is my friend l?aki. - Hello, "cousin". - Don't worry. l?aki knows. - You should have told me. - Hello. - Has anyone called? - Cesar, asking how I am. l?aki's going to a movie. - Want to come along? - Sure. Great. Don't forget your keys and don't come home late. Yes, cousin. - Who is it? - Charli. What a surprise! Charli. - Here to fire me? - What's that? What? Nothing. A passionate lover. You have something for me? Severance pay? - Who did that to you? - What? I have to return his love letters? There aren't any. - Nor photos... - There are photos. - You took them from me. - Stay out of this. You'll let them hit you? I have a great remedy for pain. I was about to take it. But I don't have the photos. Where are they? - They're not here. - Where, then? It's better for you not to know. Who was here? Answer me! Who are you covering up? - Are you going to hit me, too? - No. Tell me who it is. If I do, they'll kill you, just like they're going to kill me. You have to help me. I need money, I have to disappear. Help me. Help me. Marta! That asshole! l?aki! He's not here. Fuck! Good evening. Goodbye, Arturo. I'll call you. Goodbye. Marta... - What, cousin? - What do I tell your dad now? You think it's funny. Great. Sit down. - What do I tell him? - Charli. Don't be silly. Tell him what you want. Your boyfriend? He's cute, but a little boring. I like older men. Like you. Well, there won't be any men here, for security reasons. - Security reasons? - Yes. And because I say so. Instead of investing at a favorable moment and giving up at a sign of weakness, we're here to stay in this business. Our vocation is to continue as market investment entrepreneurs. Looking at this chart, we can see we're about to hit an upward trend... It's not true! They brought you from Mendibil, but ask us in Ibaizarra. They told us the same bull story. If you're an investor, you have the right to address the board. But your words sound more political... It's not politics! This is fraud! Only the fat cats get rich! Come up, sit here. Talk from here, but not politics... We haven't seen a single penny yet! Let go of me, scumbag! I'll remember your face. - How's Marta? - She's great. She was happy to go to your place. You look very pensive, Charli. Worried? Look at that car following us. We have a free escort. It's not that. You think that troublemaker was right? Just because he didn't do well. If he'd made money, it'd be different. - Everyone can't win. - I wanted to talk about money. - I need... - Anything. I need to take my mom to a nursing home. - Is she ill? - Her head's going. If anything happens to me, take care of Marta. Her mother's family lives in Buenos Aires. There's the money. Take some. Some more. Most people give us money under the table. Why? Like everyone, they don't want to pay taxes. They're not that innocent. How much do you need? No, much less. How much? Take it. Well... Here. Make sure she's well looked after. - Thanks, boss. - Don't thank me. And don't call me "boss". It's low-class. I've come alone. Though I was followed. You were followed? Some idiot who wanted to pick me up. You see? - You shouldn't go out alone. - It's fine. I told him to fuck off. No more going out at night. For your own good. I love it when you take care of me, Charli. I love it. Give me a break, Marta. Don't worry so much, man. Cesar told me that what's happened is like a vaccine. Now the police guard us. Give me a kiss, party pooper. I'm very sentimental. I just really like kisses. And I really like you, too. I'm glad you're here, because I'm afraid. My father's in big trouble, right? Tell me what you think. This business is complicated. And politics is mixed up in it, too. Did he really cheat those people? Individuals are what's important. They all have their own version. I don't ask. What your dad says goes. Maybe my dad is no saint. Why not? Give me a break, Marta. - Go to bed. - No. It's bedtime. Come on. - What are you doing? - Let me stay, I'm scared. - No, Marta. Don't be absurd. - Come on. - I won't do anything to you. - Maybe I will to you. Stop thinking about sex, man. Me? I'm not. Neither am I. So what's the problem? Hell, I don't know. Knock it off! - Sure. - All right... Hello? I'll be there in a couple of hours. Yes, Marta's fine. She's fine. Maybe a little bored. All right. Goodbye. Good morning. Cesar, right? Asking about his little girl. Don't worry, not a word. We have to forget this, it hasn't happened. - But it did happen. - Fine. But it won't happen again. Calm down, it's no big deal. Who showers first? - Good morning. - Hello. You've had breakfast? I was just making coffee. Where's your little cousin? - Hello. - Hello. You've gone too far this time. Charli played better than you. I set up all his goals. l?aki led the team. He never moved, he just shouted and pointed. Ignore him. You never touched the ball. He made a hole in the field from standing in one place. Katy, it's Charli. Are you there? I have the money. If I don't find you first, don't move until I get there. ... another terrorist attack. The car belonging to F. Lezcano from the controversial "Clave"investor's group was riddled with bullets in the Urkiola Pass. According to the police... Mr. Oliveira, this is Sainz. He just came from Madrid. I'm sorry about your partner. It's terrible. Terrible. Terrible is a word, but if you were me, knowing you're next, no word would suffice. Charli! Sacrist?n says Katy gave them information: our addresses, our license plates, they'll hunt us down like rabbits. It's Charli again. I'm coming over. You'll be home sooner or later, so listen: Don't open the door to anyone until I get there. You're in real trouble, and if you really want my help, you have to tell me a few things. Erase this message now. Katy! Hello, Charli. Do you know M?ndez? She didn't hear the message, but we did. Who shouldn't Katy have opened the door to? The person she did open it to. That's obvious. We're here for 20 minutes and who suddenly appears? Mr. Busybody. Let's go to the station. Wait here for the D.A. Was Charli screwing his boss's girl? The money you had to give her. What was if for? Did she charge you for sex? - That again? - Don't get nervous. - I'm not. - You wanted to warn her. - What about? - I don't know who killed her. We know who, we want to know why. Really? A lot of people around you die. It's dangerous to see you. Oliveira had him follow the girl. Nothing to do with her death. We'll see about that. What he just said was out of loyalty. Right? He has professional secrets, like journalists and priests. Our daily fucking secret. Go have a coffee. What? Come closer. Your fucking boss. He has alibis without even knowing what happened. You're lucky. Look. What? Give me a break, Cesar doesn't care what you say. Who are these two? He's the dealer. The other's dead. You're well informed. What else? - That's all I know. - And all you need to know. I won't record your visit here. Come on, your boss is going to be pissed off. Let him see you. Two of my friends have been killed, one in front of me, and the only arrest you make is my right-hand man. Why can't you arrest someone guilty - for a change? - Give me a break. Don't throw a shit fit, there are new people here. What will they think of us? Look, you're not exactly new. So tell that bunch of amateurs to treat the terrorists like they treat us. Hold on... Forget it, Sierra. He's right. THE "CLAVE" SCANDAL THOUSANDS OF INVESTORS CHEATED This is getting ugly. The tax administration will intervene. - Mr. Oliveira... - Yes? Marta can't stand my place. She'll go back home tomorrow. Another setback! We'll figure it out. Sacrist?n took the photos away from me. What? - Sacrist?n was there. - So what? I went back to the hotel... What are you trying to do? Get your head blown off? We have nothing to do with this war. We have our own problems. Yes, boss. Don't call me "boss", damnit! We'll get nowhere that way. You have to follow my instructions exactly. Can I ask you for something? - Can I? - Yes, boss. Yes, I'm your boss. But not just that. Without me, you'd be nothing but shit. Read this. Look at the stamp. Familiar? I'm an exploiter of the Basque people and I have to pay them millions. I'll pay it, Charli. I'll pay because I'm scared shitless. I can't leave Marta fatherless. But fuck them, it's their people's money, the ones they say they're protecting. You should go back to that kid, someone your own age. But I like you. Think of life with me. Hold on. It's not that big a deal. I like you and we have fun. That's all. That's all? What if your dad finds out? You'll be fired. Not just that. We can go far away. I told him you want to go back home. Fuck off, Charli. Why did you tell him that? Leave me alone! - Be reasonable. - I don't want to be! Give me my suitcase! Get in the car. Stick the car up your ass. I know the way home. Take me to St. Nicolas. I told them you were taking me to mass. You told them that? Why not? It's Sunday. Wait for me in back. Slow down, Charli. Up there on the left. That way. Who's that guy? A farmer at work. Calm down, Charli. I don't like it. They don't work this way. They're just middlemen. Don't worry. Wait for me here. Let me go. No, I have to go alone. The instructions were clear. It's just a transaction. He's coming around. Good, they're on their way. Don't move, you're in bad shape. - Call the police... - The ambulance is coming. Listen, a man was just kidnapped right here. They took him away in a white van. How do you know? He's my boss, Cesar Oliveira, an important man. Where's a phone? That phone's only for the doctor and the priest. Don't tell anyone here you work for Oliveira. I didn't see anything. You didn't see anything? You saw the van! - Shall we take him in? - Wait. You never saw that van before? Lots of vans drive through here. Fucking hell. No one saw anything, like always. The bastards' letters were on his desk. Why didn't he tell me? Disasters happen wherever you go. You couldn't stop them? What's wrong, Sainz? The weather here? Look over these closely. This amateur and the escort shitheads guarded him well. I told his daughter I want to know when they contact her. Don't act alone. - We have to tell my dad's partners. - No. No one has to be involved. They'll treat him well, he's worth money. And we'll give it to them. Whoever's it is, we need it. Get a suitcase from Do?a Asun. Take care of this, Do?a Asun. No one must know what's inside. I don't even want to know. For me, anything that you two do is good. You take care of the lawyer. I get the wise guy. There's no guarantee, but I have done it before. Do you know who did it? Isn't it obvious? I mean which branch of ETA. Or it could be the Autonomous Commandos. They'll contact you soon. You have to move very carefully. I'll do what I can, if it can save our people from suffering. People? What people? How much will you charge? Like I said, it depends on the ransom. What do I tell Marta? That he's all right. If you pay, everything will be okay. We're used to it. I told you not to act alone. Someone had to. Why don't you leave it to the professionals? I am a professional. My client is in trouble. Listen. This is unofficial: We should pay, but let me make the contacts, not that useless lawyer. When I'm ready, give me the money. What money? Don't act dumb, Charli. I have to talk to his partners and sell the stock. There's no stock to sell. But there are safes to open. Charli! What happened? I met someone. We need to know the ransom. - What did they say? Is he okay? - Don't worry, he's fine. Wait... - Are you sure? - Yes, I am. He's calm, waiting. He knows we can pay the ransom. Hello? Yes, one moment. Arturo? Hi. No, I can't. No, not that either. No, really, I can't. - Why not? - Because, Goddamnit! You heard her, kid. She can't! CARLOS PE?A "CHARLI" BEST YOUTH PLAYER A letter for me? Yes, she may have written it. She must have forgotten. I'll go see. I'll be right there. I'm going to see my mom. You'll come back? Yes. This trophy's yours? I gave it to your dad. I owe him my life. After my injury, if it weren't for him, I'd be an invalid. Then I owe it to you. If it weren't for you... You'd have been fine. I'll go with you tomorrow. - No way. - Yes, I'm going. We'll see. I have to go. You know what? I think I'm in love with you. But don't worry. If I'm in love, that's my problem. What can I say? Don't say anything. Look who's here, Carmen. How are you? I'm fine, I'm fine. Aren't I? Of course. The letter's there. We were going to mail it to you. I have to go. I'll take her to watch TV later. She shouldn't be alone. When can I leave? I can't take you out now, Mom. But I will soon. Try to remember... who brought this? Charli! Charli, wait! You asshole, you wanted to leave me behind. - That is your thing. - Where's the bar, kids? Over there. Didn't you play with Barakaldo Juniors? You haven't lost it. If they hadn't hurt you... What a shame. They fucked you over, Charli. - A beer. - And a wine. - What do we do? - Nothing. We wait. We don't want bodyguards or gunmen here. You've fucked us over enough as it is. Let go! You'll shoot me, asshole? - What's up, Esteban? - Know who he works for? Come on, get out of here. Why did you get involved? What do you know? Don't get angry, Esteban. He's a nobody. Leave him alone. What's their problem? I had a run-in with that bastard. My father cheated them, right? You left the map? Thanks for helping out. You're welcome. They're good kids deep down. I can help you. How? You have to trust me. Go over the French border. I'll call you. I won't say my name, but you'll know me. Mr. Sacrist?n came by. We didn't say a single word. Good. As long as he doesn't find the money... Come with me, please. - Charli, I'm scared. - Relax. We'll let you go through and pay. We don't have the money or know the amount. Just collaborate later. That money will hurt us. Just remember the faces, the details. It's valuable information. I only care about helping my boss. You have to take sides. Two red wines. Don't turn around. But someone's staring at us. He just wants to pick me up. - Any problems? - No. A car is waiting for you at the corner. - You want a drink? - Hurry up. I'll pay for this. Is it your first time... First time here? I spent a summer in Biarritz. Biarritz is pretty. Inside. Go on. You're here. You come with us. You stay. You don't count. - She stays with me. - Come on. - We won't eat her. - It's okay. I'll be okay. Let's go. Charli, it's just a question of getting an invoice. Hello, Charli. Surprised? Not anymore. My friends aren't what they seem. You people must laugh at idiots like me. "You people"? You and my boss. I'll ignore the comparison. Sit down. I have nothing to drink... I'm okay. Who else negotiates? First we want proof he's okay... Open the door. It's not to keep you in, but to keep others out. - Who? - Who knows? Charli, we don't have Oliveira. Then why talk to her? I want to talk to you, not to her. To me? Why? Why are you with them? Speak clearly. If they let him go, he should leave. What do you want? I can find him for you. In exchange... He knew a lot of cops. You must know about them. They do interest us. Think about it: Oliveira for information. Decide which side you're on. It's not all bad. We have an important contact. Well? You have nothing to say? I have to go out. My mom's not well. I'll be right back. We don't even know if Cesar's okay... We can't lose hope. I'm going to a hotel where I think Katy was killed. Forget it, Charli. There's nothing we can do. Remember me? The bird guy. Want to take more photos? I want to pay the account of Hilario Montesinos. He left a room unpaid. - Who are you? - That doesn't matter. - I pay his accounts. - I don't think so. - What about Enriqueta Aguirre? - No. Neither Aguirre nor Montesinos? Where are you going? Call the police! Remember me? The photographer? The couple that used to come here... Lots of couples come here. The police took the girl away in an ambulance. It wasn't the girl. It was the man. She didn't leave on a stretcher? No, she walked out with the police chief. - Was it this man? - Yes, that's him. It sounded bad. I think he was dead. That's him! Give it to him! Sainz! Take off the handcuffs. - Come with me. - Listen... - There's no time. - It's important... They found Oliveira in a ditch. He's been dead for some time. Come on, move it. Where are you going? Leave her alone. It's hard on the girl. Here. That's everything. I forgot to give them back before. This photo? - Who's with the dead girl? - He's dead, too. What? He died right before she did. But I don't know why. Yes. Yes, I'm her son. Okay. - Cesar! - "Cesar"? I'm not "Daddy" anymore? I'm not used to the uniform. Quiet, they'll hear us. How does it look? You're very handsome. You're beautiful. And a great actress. I heard you were convincing. I was shaking all over. Look, we don't have much time. It's too risky for me to come back. Talk to Charli, give him my instructions. We're leaving. The three of us? The three of us. My condolences. Hello, Charli. Hello. How are you? Where have you been? I couldn't talk to you. That bastard wouldn't let you. They've been playing with us, Marta. Don't worry. It's true, they've fooled us. Could you see well in the forest? Look, maybe it was this man and your dad's alive. Of course he is. How did you know? What do you know? He came to see me. - Who did? - My dad. You've seen him? Yes, twice. He came to tell me what to do. Hold on, I have to go pee. What I couldn't do was look at the body. It was scary. But they believed me. You saw me. Didn't I do it well? Very well. Of course he's alive. All three of us are going. You have to take him the money. Of course. Charli, how are you? Better than me, I'm sure. You can't imagine how boring being dead is. I'm so glad to see you! But you don't look so good. Aren't you glad to see me? Of course. It's been hard for you. For both of you. You made Marta an accomplice. And me an idiot. - An idiot and an accomplice. - Charli. That's the past now. Now we all have to disappear. But first you have to show you paid the ransom money. I won't play anymore. Don't be so melodramatic. You helped me survive, that's what you did. - Just to keep some farmers' money. - No, to save my life. And you had to kill Katy? Katy and her friend were two little angels? Don't look at me like that. Let's get the money. I didn't bring it. Hell, Charli, why not? Bad idea. Did you get scared? An attack of honesty? Who will you give it to? Or will you keep it? I told you not to trust him. - I told you it was all too risky. - Come on. It was a great scheme. You're dead and ETA has the money. It's too late for regrets. Just bring the money soon. You'll kill me? Come on, Charli, don't do anything crazy. Come on, give that to me. Good. Besides, is it loaded? Bastard! You think I'd shoot you? You should have done it. He's been trying to double-cross us. Now there's only one path for you: always at my side. You want to kill me? Or do you want to send me and Marta to jail? This is the last time. This time, without any tricks. Don't worry, we'll do what's best for all of us. Quickly, because ETA knows I'm not dead. What was he doing here? Oliveira's bodyguard can tell us. His death will save us some unpleasant questions. Uncover him. It's definitely Montesinos, you were right. Will you help us? If the girl gets off free. That's easy. It was very dark. Sacrist?n had already identified him. Given the state of deterioration of the body... All right, then. I told Cesar I wouldn't go without you. Don't worry about it any more. Come on, Charli, cheer up. Everything will be okay. Don't lose him, we have to finish this. Give me the check-in information. Spread out and keep your eyes open. BILBAO POLICE CHIEF FOUND DEAD IN THE WOODS There he is. Marta. Goodbye. Goodbye? Aren't you coming? - Don't make a scene. - You pig! You planned this! Let go of me! Marta, come on... I won't go without you. - Goodbye, boss. - Don't call me boss. It's the last time. Come on, Marta! Police! Hit the floor! - Come on, Marta. - Let go of me! Charli, please. Charli... Charli... Charli... Charli... Charli, wake up. Next time, we mix the teams so the girls won't win. How's your chest? It's fine now. You can laugh about it now, but you almost died. I'm going to have a wine, that's good for it. A glass of wine. Thanks, Jos?. Charli. When did you get out? I left the hospital six months ago. How are you? Fine. I'm with these guys. We're going to a concert in Donosti. How are you? I'm fine, too. How's your dad? He's fine as well. Although I never see him, but... I can't say where he is. I don't want to know. - Sure. - Come on, Marta! Is that Arturo? Arturo? No. Good memory. Who could forget it? It's unforgettable. I haven't forgotten it. Me neither. Marta, let's go. You'll miss the concert. Well... Come see me sometime. I live in the same place.
