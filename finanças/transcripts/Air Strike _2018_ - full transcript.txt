Subtitles by explosiveskull 1937. Japanese forces invade China. The Battle of Shanghai has been lost. The capital at Nanjing falls. Millions of people leave their homes in a mass migration for survival. Chinese forces regroup. This time... Madam Ye! We must take the kids and leave! Now. To the basement. Move fast. Everybody, hurry. Come. Now. Come on, dear. Here you go. Huh? Manguan Xue? Because I lost this darn place to you, it doesn't mean you can lock me out. Come on. Whoa! Lucky, you okay? Did it give you a big scare? Uh-uh. Don't worry, boy. This tea house is still ours. Even though their name's on the door. We won it fair and square. Yaogu cheats. Shut up. Nine bamboos. Hey, hey, honey. Tell me then, Yaogu Xue. What were you secretly discussing in the tea room earlier? Ah... Oh. Why would I tell you? Well, why would you have any reason not to tell me? How many pilots do we have left? Fifteen left, sir. How many planes? Thirteen I-16s, one I-15, two in repair. We're recruiting as we speak, sir. We are soldiers, Colonel. Protecting our country in war is our job. I know how you feel. You have to be rational. Can't just send these kids up there to get shot down. I need you two. Both of you. If we don't take action, the Japanese will continue to bomb Chongqing. How could we face our people? We need more planes. And we need to get those kids out there trained. Nobody flies today. Sir? Please allow us to go kick some ass. Let's go! We're barely making a dent. How do we take them out? Shoot the fuel tanks. Yeah! - What kind of planes are those, Captain? - The new Zeros. Argh! Watch out! Incoming for you. No! I can't shake this guy. I got you covered. Lei Tao! My brother, I'm not gonna make it back for dinner. Lei Tao! Ugh! Ten-hut! I promise to avenge you, brother. Vice-captain Gangtou Xue, 22nd Squadron. Reporting from the 4th Battalion. At your service. Captain Xue, since you are unable to fight due to injury, the air force has loaned you to us for a special mission. I'm at your command, sir. Tomorrow at 8:00 a.m., you will go down to the port and take truck 82560 back to Chongqing. The Japanese planes are patrolling the roads, firing upon anything that moves. It is extremely dangerous. I understand, sir. Your mission is to ensure that truck gets to Chongqing in one piece. Gangtou? Little Cui? What in heaven's name is going on? I'm supposed to safeguard this truck. I didn't expect to see you. Go over there. Drive straight on through. Pilots of China, we have reached a very critical time in this war with the Japanese. I don't expect any of you new trainees to get up there and take down every Zero you see, but I do want you to take this training very seriously. Yes, sir. We are here to avenge our family and comrades. Who told you to speak? That's not why you're here. You are here to protect your families, your mothers, your fathers, your children, from having the bombs dropped on them from the Japanese. That's your job. What do you know about these planes? I know I can put up a fight. I know that once you reach the combat zone, you have a very short life expectancy. Five days, if that. I don't wanna be attending your funeral or any of these men's funerals. At ease. This Yank thinks he's a hardass. Don't take it personally. So you're the new target practice? Huh? Think shooting Zeros is easy? You think it's a piece of cake? He's worse than the American. Let's go. Hold on. You're hiding something. Why do you say that? What's in this truck? Medicine. I know you're lying. What's in there? I told you. You think I'm naive, huh? Gangtou? Gangtou! Gangtou, do not open that! They'll court-martial you. Where's your soldier's honor? Medicine, huh? Why can't you just believe what somebody tells you for once? I told you the deal. I get my wife once I deliver. And I'm entering the mahjong contest. I'm gonna win back our tea house once and for all. So you have a plan to beat my sister-in-law? Ha! She's just a cheater and a bragger. Everyone knows how she won. Did I ever tell you how she did it? Is this truck going to Chongqing? I've been trying to hitch a ride for two days. You can run over me if you like. I'm not leaving. I like the sound of that. All right! It's all right. Easy now. Officer, could you please do me a favor? Deliver these two English pigs to Director Liu of the National Livestock Research Center. Professor Chun's my name. I did my job. What do you do? So you're an expert in livestock? Not really. The research I've done focuses on selective breeding. I brought these two piglets back from England. They have a high meat-to-fat ratio, about 55% or so. If the experiment works as planned... But right now, human life matters the most. Pigs are worthless. You deal in fighting wars, I deal in porcine research. Officer, I'll repair your truck in return for a ride. Piss off! Why don't you let him try? We can't stay stuck here. We'll definitely get bombed. Planes are coming! Well? Hurry up. Ha! Yes! Get out of my truck! Get the hell out! Get out. Come here. Look down there. See where you almost put us, huh? Officer... Sir, I'm a mechanic and a good driver. You have my word, this will never happen again. Attention. I'm taking away your flying privileges. You have to let me know what I did wrong. - You really don't know? - No, I don't. - What was your altitude? - Forty-five hundred. - AOT? - Fifteen degrees. - How fast were you supposed to be going? - One hundred. And you were going? Ninety. So you do know the difference. You still wanna ask me what you did wrong? You crying about your dead brother? Your brother you got killed? Is it just that I'm treating you too harshly, or are you just feeling shitty? I'm feeling shitty. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. - I'm feeling shitty! - Good! That's what I want! Now get the fuck out of here now! I'm sorry. I was wrong. Quick. Come on, come on. Come here. Hurry. Hey! Wait up, don't leave! Come on, children. What's going on? There's a pretty young girl walking down the road. Stop gawking. Drive on. Where are you going, my friends? Chongqing. We could take them with us, right? I call the shots here. I'll pay their fare. It's not about the money, Professor. Be quiet. You don't have a say here. Give me one good reason not to take them. - Why would I? - Because. Did you join the army just to look tough, Officer? Protecting women and children is a soldier's duty. You have to take these children with you. Why is that? Because their dads are soldiers like you. Ooh. Nice coupling. Impressive. And look at all these people. How many have signed up, huh? Ah, Uncle Cui. Hi. Are you signing up, too, Cui? Oh, come on now. His gambling days are over. We mustn't encourage him to start playing again. I'm here to sign up for my son. When he comes and competes with you, this tea house right here may well return to its rightful owners. I'll be ready for him. Hmm. Where are you from? Uh... I worked at Union Bank in Jiangxi, then the Japs came. What's in the bag? Is it money? I wish. No, documents. I have to keep them right here. What for? It's sensitive customer information. Numbers, statements. That kinda stuff. Has to be private. Why is that? Honor. Take cover over there! Take the kids! - Go. - Where? - Get in the truck, now! - Oh, no, my pigs. My pigs. Hey. Come on, you fascists! I'm right here! Fascist clowns! Come on! Got it. Got your pig. Argh! - Cui! - No! Cui! Cui. Cui. I won't make it home. Give this... to my father for the contest. Let him... win for once as a mahjong champion. The truck is carrying... Wait, wait. Step back. Here, give the hose to me. I got it. No, careful. These flames just won't go out. All right. Someone help them put this fire out. Faster, faster. I'm not really with the army. Ah... I'm with the air force. I love the air force. So dignified. What nonsense. We go up there to die. I'm not afraid of the Japs, but their planes are more advanced. It's a bloodbath up there. Try to get in there first or they'll shoot you down. Thank you, hero. I'm not a hero. Not as long as I'm alive. In the last few battles, everyone in our squadron died. Except for me. They were the real heroes. I'm the one loser who got through. Go. Take the kids. Get away, take the kids. Get away from here. Stay away. It's a bomb from a Japanese plane. Didn't blow. I can try and disable it. - Please don't risk it if you're not certain. - What else can we do? The road's narrow. Truck won't fit. You shouldn't risk it if you're not sure. What are you doing? Why are you here? We ask for your permission to join the battle, sir. No way. The Japanese airplanes are humiliating us. How can you sit here and play mahjong? Mahjong is no kids' stuff. It's mimic warfare. Could be helpful with your critical thinking, especially yours. Sir, people in the city and even the whole country are calling us helpless cowards. We cannot bear this anymore. Please give us permission to fight. A truly brave person does not demonstrate his bravery by hastening his death for nothing. And if he has to die, he has to die a martyr's death. But your air force is not well-trained or equipped at all. Even then, it's better than sitting here playing mahjong. Ha! Yes! Big three dragons, red dragon. That was quite a trick back there. If you were Japanese, you'd tell me, right? You're a joker. You don't like me, but that's okay. And I don't like you either. But we do have a common interest. And what's that? The truck. I need a ride, and you can't drive right now. At least you know your place. Argh! Son of a bitch! Which bastard's flying that plane? That is fucked up! Hey! Shoot that son of a bitch through the head and come back here. Roger that. An Minxun, hurry up and return back to base. Why? There are multiple bogeys coming your way. We're being ambushed. Fucking hit! Goddamn it! Hey! What's that up there? d Amazing grace d d How sweet the sound d d That saved a wretch like me d Come on, follow me, he's right here. - I need to come through. - Hey! He's Jap! - It's a Jap! - He's a Jap! Kill him! Stop! He's one of us. Stop the truck! Move! Minxun. He's Chinese. You almost killed him! Cut him loose. I'll take him. Quick, children, under the table. Come over here! Come on, run! Get up. Come on. We must lay him down. Go. - Outside. Now. Go on. - Come on, kids. Stay together. Okay. Easy. We have to operate here. We don't have much time. How can we operate here? If we don't take the bullet out, he's gonna die. Be strong. Here, take this. Take it. But for what? Just take it! - Stay strong. - Sterilize it. - What're you doing? - Look, it looks deep. Don't move. Try this. Tell me what to do and I'll do it. Open it. Go on. Feel around for the bullet, and pull it out. Found it. We'll have to give him stitches. But how? Nice work, Mei. My mom's a seamstress. I've been sewing buttons on since I was a child. Look, friend. I got it out. Thank you. Are you trying to kill him? You don't know what you're doing. Hey, watch it. Who are you talking to? You forgot a detail, like hygiene. You can help me. Let's clean it. Hey. Hello, guys. Yeah. There are enough of you to form a squad. Who here wants to be a squad leader, huh? Still doesn't work. Minxun? I'm leaving. Minxun. Minxun, you can't leave, brother. Pilot shoots his enemy from the sky. If we have to die, then we die up there, not down here. I'm sorry. Don't worry. I know what you did for my brother. Let me finish what you both started. A reporter from the newspaper. She saved your life. Susan. Before the war, I studied medicine. But now, I'm a journalist. I want the world to know what really happened in Chongqing. The sun is rising. Time to cross the river. You're not out of the woods yet. We'll go to the hospital when we reach the other side. No need. So many in our squadron... they died for our country. I have to return to the battlefield. You must be afraid. I'm not. I just don't want any regrets. I understand how you feel. Just let me know if you need my help. I'm sorry. Sir? There's a supply shortage at the front. There are four million of us. If we all donate one yuan, we will raise 4 million yuan. We can use the money to buy planes and artillery to fight those Japs! Chongqing is our last stand. There's nowhere left to retreat to. It will take every one of us to stand up and fight the Japanese invaders and showing everyone that we will never give up! The Japanese have dropped thousands of tons of bombs on this city. What they don't know is that this Chinese heart in here will never stop! Never! Never! Never! Never! Coming through. Make way. Let us through. Hurry up, hurry up. Help me, help me. I can't stop the bleeding. We tried different compresses. He's hemorrhaging badly. He's stopped breathing. Hurry, please. Julia? I thought you got on the boat. Why are you still here? The boat was hit before it even docked. I came back with a team transporting the wounded. You are the expert brought here by our government. Since you're still here, we could really use your help. The boat sails to England twice a month. So you'll have my international assistance for the next two weeks. Thanks a lot. Let's get to work. Hmm. Hey. You want some water? Some water? Something? The last boat out of here leaves tomorrow, Steve. I want you on it. I can't leave these people. After this, I can't guarantee safe passage. Someone told me something. Stuck with me. If you're not willing to fight for what you love... then you never deserved it in the first place. May God be with you. Take care, Steve. Excuse me, I'm looking for an Uncle Cui. Yeah. That's me. Gangtou gave me, um, a couple of things to give you. There's a letter, and this. - Here you are. - Oh. Gangtou? Where is he? On the north side. The bridges are down. He's stuck there. Can you get her a cup of tea? Not for me. I must get going. But thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Young Gangtou is such a good boy. It's so nice of him to think of me. - Yeah. - Would you tell me what it says, please? Yeah. Yeah. Uncle... Something wrong? Your boy is gone. Lucky, I have nothing to live for now. I'm too sad to take care of you. I'm sorry. You deserve better. Go now. Find someone with a reason to live. Here you go. Thanks. I taught him everything he knows. But I got to ask you, what's a beautiful girl like you doing with this guy? Hey, Minxun, my good friend, you don't mind if I show your pretty lady friend around the base? Yeah, he's good. That's good. Hey, come on... Sir! Sir. You aren't concerned about us exploiting your first date with this beautiful woman? Uh... We're not dating. I order you to escort this young woman around the base. That's an order. These photos are more full of life than any I've ever taken. Mmm-mmm. It's ready. Wow. Gorgeous. Here you are. For keepsake. You keep one for yourself. I'm leaving. Tomorrow morning. Just make sure you stay alive. Yeah, you, too. I forbid you to die. Be careful with my piggies! Look here. I'll teach you. From here to here to the target, line up the dots and you can't miss. But be careful... What is going on? Are you out of your mind? Why are you teaching them about guns? You're worse than gunpowder. Always exploding. Well, if that's the case, you shouldn't provoke me. You're just a big bully. Let's go. What do you think of her? Flawless. Perfect. Easy. From the first time I've seen this fighter plane, I've never been afraid to die. I'll always find the right reason to fight. What do you mean, sir? You and An Minxun have that experience. But only one person could pilot the P-40. There's only one man who can fly the P-40. That's me! Hey! Minxun! You come back here right now! Are you deaf? Get off. That P-40 is mine! You get that? Get up! Argh! Give me the P-40, please. Please let me seek revenge. Take the damn P-40. But you're not the only one seeking revenge. The winner of today's contest will donate his winnings to help our forces fight the Japs. So, with pleasure, I hereby start the contest. Our Uncle Cui's son died for our country. So we're pleased to announce Cui will play instead! Sit down. Yeah. Come on. There. Take a seat. That's it. Make it strong. Put in lots of nails. - How's it going? - Take the kids across, okay? Be careful. Oh, okay. Sure. Come on. It's an air raid! Come on! Run! Drive across. Get them in the truck. Get all the kids in the truck. d Happy birthday to you d d Happy birthday to Colonel Jack d d Happy birthday to you d It's an honor to be here with you men tonight. I appreciate this little party. This may be my last birthday. Just a moment, sir. Sir... please keep our presents. From now on, we want you to stay on the ground and command us. For our sakes, you have to stay alive. Thank you very much. I know what this gift represents and what it means, and this is also my war. It's been an honor serving with you. My father was a soldier as well. This is his watch. He said that if anything ever happened to him, he should... give it to his son, and he did. This is his watch. Let's set some rules. No matter what happens tomorrow, the last person standing will be the one to receive these presents. Let's have some cake and celebrate being a soldier. To battle. Oh, no, not again. What's wrong with it? The children. We have to go. We have to get to them. Oh, God. Let's hope we're not too late. Stay close. The children. Save them. But I can't leave you here. Forgot my lighter. Let's get this done quick. Yes, sir! Damn it. Yaogu! Manguan! Don't get squashed! Manguan! - Manguan! - Damn it! Stop pushing. Let me in. Let me in. I hope you rot in hell! You try anything and I swear I'll kill you. What is this cargo you're carrying? It must be precious. You think I don't know what's on your mind? Cross that bridge. Aah! Multiple Zeros approaching. Boys, fire at will. Open up! Fucker! Shit! Fucker! Get everyone out of here. Protect the commander. Let's evacuate. I want everyone out of here. Follow me. They're dead. - What's the matter? - Uncle Cui! The shelter collapsed. Lots of people buried alive. Then let's get some help around here. Yaogu! Yaogu! Yaogu! Hurry! There are survivors inside. Yaogu! Yaogu! Yaogu! Hurry. Hurry up. Come on. - Uncle Cui! - Manguan. - Give me the baby. - Cui. Thank you. Yaogu! I need you to wake up. Please wake up. You're a very tough boy, Lang Tu. - Water! Who has water? - You'll beat this. Thank you so much. Come on now, Lang Tu. You can do it. Drink some of this. What can I do? What can I do? Go on. Spit it! - Huh? - Spit. Right on her face. Yaogu. Yaogu! My love. You're alive! - That's my Yaogu! - Lang Tu! Lang Tu! Lang Tu is awake! Come on. Here. Take this. I have business to attend to. I'll see you later. Don't leave. Don't cry now, my love. It's all right. Come on. - Come on. Come with me. - No need to cry. - We'll try. - We'll try. We'll see Papa. Come on. I'm gonna take care of you. - Come. - You'll be fine. Hey, can you tell me what this says? Mm, I can speak English, but I'm not very good at reading it. But Ding's pretty smart. Hey, Ding. Can you take a look at this? - It's written by someone who has... - No! No need to analyze it. Just tell me. They want you to deliver this note to a Miss Susan at Xinhua Daily. The silver coin is for your troubles. What silver coin? There's nothing in here. Come on. Since you've obviously already availed yourself of the money, you should deliver this note. I'm telling you, someone's taken it. Looks like that someone was you, my friend. No, you put a silver coin. No, that means you'd make twice the money. If you took the coin, just deliver it. Someone else can do it. I'm not. Ah. It's a question of honor, huh? You called for me? This P-40, it belongs to you. I'm not following. You're a better pilot. As of today, I'll be your wingman. Excuse me, miss? Hey! I know you. Likewise, sir. So what brings you here? I'm looking for Miss Susan. I'm Miss Susan. I didn't take the money that was in there. For me? Just a letter. Thank you, Uncle Cui. That message must be worth something. He wants to marry me. Buy yourself a wedding gift. This is the final stretch. Japan has her best men forward. All of our best men are gone. But we're still here. The Japanese are getting their biggest bombers ready, so we, as a reserve team, are gonna fight those sons of bitches. Most importantly, we're still standing here. We have not died. We need the world to remember this is Chongqing's sky. Light up those burning fires in yourself and use all the bullets to puncture the armor. Let's welcome a bloody fight to the end. Swift as thunder! Argh! Charlie, where are you? Can't see. Your two o'clock, I think. - It's a Chinese plane. - Get him out of here! So I wasn't wrong. Why are you here? To finish up. With what? You've been protecting the British decoder on this entire journey. You think I didn't know? You risked being killed by your own planes for that? There are only two outcomes of war. Life or death. Taking the decoder from you or blowing it up have different consequences. I choose to take it with me. You son of a... Once I pull this safety ring, the truck will be blown sky-high. And the decoder with it. It's gonna be brilliant. What's that under the truck? Gotta get the truck away from all that gasoline back there. Get out of here. It might blow. I'm staying with you. It's gonna blow. Get out of here. Here. Scissors. The one on the right. I've just got a hunch. Do it. Gangtou? Gangtou? Gangtou! What are you doing? You've got to wake up! We've come so far. You're not going to leave me by myself now. Don't die, don't die, don't die! Why did I tell you to cut the wire? You never should have listened to me. Wake up. Wake up! Don't you know... you should never slap a man? You were right, you know. It didn't blow. It was another bomb. Be my wife. I probably don't deserve you, but I'll make you happy. Come on! Go ahead and shoot my Chongqing heart. You're not getting out of this. Tao Lei! I tried... Argh! Where are you going? Don't worry. Fuel tank's empty. Request emergency landing. Air speed, 25. Height, 85 meters. Come on. Come on! Down! Come on! Yeah. Come on. Line it up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Whoo! Ah! Yeah! Yeah, Xue! Propping up. Unbelievable. Most admirable trainee. Fantastic! Sir. Air Force Captain Gangtou Xue reporting for duty. Unbelievable. Unbelievable landing. Are you all right? It was a tough mission. Chongqing's safer, thanks to you. You'll be decorated. I'll see to it. Sir, it should go to the driver who took the mission. He really deserves it. His name is Sergeant Cui. He died for our country on the journey. He gave me the mission, right after he was shot. Did he explain to you what it was? No, he didn't, sir. He just said to deliver it. That's all he said. Good work. It's the night of the mahjong final and Gangtou Xue's wedding! Nice to see you. Hello. Come in. Welcome. Hello, everyone. Come on in. I should go to be with the guests. Gangtou! Come here. Three characters. Nice tile. There we are. South wind. Come on. It's mahjong, not mind-reading. There. A nine! I've won! Nine characters. You see that? Wow! This one's for you. My son! Honey? Honey? - Huh? - It's falling. There's a bomb! Protect yourselves! Uncle Cui! Let me help you. No. It could blow. - Let me... - Be careful. Easy, Uncle Cui. - Here, use this chair. - Okay. - Be careful. - Go easy now, Cui. - Hmm. - Make sure you're steady. I got you. Stay where you are. Be careful. Watch your step. Take it easy. Get out of the way. Move over, move over! Gangtou! Get away! Get it out. Get it out now. Get away. Get out. Get it out now! Don't follow me. You all have families. I have no one. Whatever happens, from this moment on, I accept my fate. So be it. So be it. So be it. Get the hell away from me! d In the face of fear We walk by hiding... d Uncle Cui! Uncle Cui! You called? I'm very proud to announce that this year's Mahjong Champion is Uncle Cui! Thanks to... one tile. Uncle Cui? It's time to take back the keys. What are you doing? Uh, wait a minute, Yaogu. I appreciate your gesture, but the rules of the game were already established. Yeah. Remember? This money's going to the air force. You can keep the tea house. But I'm keeping this one tile as a souvenir. Don't say that. I've just announced it. You're trying to make me lose face. These are yours. Look, let's get this straight. I'm just enjoying being an honest winner. She handed the victory to you on a plate. Not quite. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I got it. We each take half of the tea house. And Manguan and I will run it for you. - Well? - Well? What was that? What are you saying? I get half the profits... as co-owner, and yet you two will do all the work? - Right. - Right. I really like the sound of that. Manguan. You're like my new son. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Minxun, I hate to leave you, but I'm heading to the front. These pictures, steeped in blood and tears, are witnesses to the tragedy and strength of our people. You're like a sword in the dark, my darling Minxun. Your tight embrace made me lose my fear of death. The pictures are for you. I hope they will remind you of me and my camera. The Chinese culture will live on. For the freedom and security of our children and their children, we must defend this sacred land with our lives. Subtitles by explosiveskull
