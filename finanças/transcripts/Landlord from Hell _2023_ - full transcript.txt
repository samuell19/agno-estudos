Tell me what? Was that Kevin? Yeah. I'm moving in with him. We're in love. I'm the one that's in love with you. Flattered, seriously, but, um... - We can't... - No, no, no, wait, wait, no. - Let go! - I want you to stay here. With me! I don't love you! Sorry, I didn't know it was gonna be this far. I just don't understand why she has to stay here. I told you already. Ever since maddie's mom passed away, She's gone into a tailspin, She's failed out of college, she's completely broke. She just needs a little help getting back on her feet. Well, tell her to get a cheap motel, then. Why? This place is empty. We both live in the city. You won't let me rent it out, - You won't let me sell it. - I'm just not ready. Well, how long is she gonna be here? Must be mad die. Well, tell her she has to stay outta this bedroom. Yeah. She can stay in the guest room. Aunt grace. Maddie! How long has it been? - Um... - Come in, come in! - How old were you? - I don't know, maybe 12? That's right. You were asking everyone for training bras. For your birthday. I didn't find out about your mom's passing. Until it was too late. That's okay. I would have gone to the funeral. It's okay, aunt grace. Really. It's fine. I'm just glad we got to reconnect. Well, you're here now. You have such a nice house. Thanks! Paul and I have really enjoyed it over the years. He's been spending a lot more time here. Since we lost our tenant. But we love our place in the city. Are you okay? Paul and I have been going through a rough patch. Um... Things just haven't been the same for about a year. So sorry to hear that. Marriage can be tough. Any relationship can be tough. You saw that with your mom and I. Are you sure you should still go? To Africa? I think it'll do us some good. Ugh, I'm so nervous, too. It's my first commission on that side of the world, so, but you take such good pictures! You're gonna do great. What about you? Have you kept up with your photography? Your mom mentioned it once, Said you couldn't focus on biology because, uh, You were too busy being an artist. Well, that may have been part of the reason, but I don't know, I just love it. Just staring outside at the scenery. Is getting my creative juices flowing. I can feel your mom's eyes rollin' from heaven at me. Right now. Me too. You know what? You are more than welcome to use the camera equipment I'm not taking with me to Africa. I mean, some of it's pretty dated, but I'd love to see what you do with it while I'm gone. Gosh, thank you! Well, you should probably meet Paul. Paul? This is my niece mad die. Hi, Paul! Thanks again for letting me stay here for a while. I just need a fresh start is all. I'm not really happy about you staying here, But since you're grace's niece, fine. I just have one rule: Stay out of this bedroom. See what I've been dealing with? He's been so difficult lately. I swear, men are oversized toddlers. Listen, mad die. I'm not sure what's gonna happen when I come back, but... If things don't change, I'm afraid this is the end of Paul and I. Don't say that! It's true, Which is one of the reasons why I'm super excited you're here. If you can help me get this place into shape, I could put it on the market. Who knows? Maybe you can help me sell it. And I can give you commission. Of course! Anything for you, aunt grace. Again, I really appreciate you letting me stay here. Oh. And there's one more important thing I need to discuss with you. What is it? I guess there's no way of beating around the bush. Um, Paul and I never got around to putting internet here. That's it? Yes, that's it. Honestly, my phone's probably gonna shut off here. Soon anyway, but you know what? I'm actually looking forward to just tuning out. And turning off the rest of the world. Oh, good! I wasn't sure how you were gonna take that. Oh, and the cell reception is spotty. Otherwise, the landline works perfectly great. What is that thing? Just kidding. I saw one on the history channel once. Oh, you're funny. Come on! And we have a fully stocked wine rack, Which you're more than welcome to raid. Is this heaven?! Oh my god, I can't believe you remember that. How could I forget? Any last questions? No. I don't think so. Again, I really do appreciate it. Please. Just make yourself at home. All the important numbers are on the fridge. And should anything go wrong, just I know, I know. You'll be in Africa, so just call Paul. Got it. I'll make sure Paul checks on you every so often. Yeah. I'll be sure to do that. Okay. Thanks. Take care, mad die. I'll see you when I get back. - Have a great time. - I will. I'm leaving. Don't burn the place down. Great. Who are you? Oh, shoot! No... Um, hello? Hey, girl. Maddie? Where are you calling me from? My aunt's... are you ready for this... - Rotary phone. - What? No way. Yeah, I-I kinda misplaced my cell phone. Oh. So how long do you plan on staying out there? I don't know. Until I get my act together? Or I become a famous photographer. Or they kick me out. "They"? Yeah, my aunt and her husband. I'm supposed to call him if I need anything. While she's away. Oh, wow, so he's like your landlord now? Yeah, I guess. Anyway, there's also this other guy. He lives next door. Is he cute? Uh, I wouldn't have mentioned him if he wasn't. True. Anyway, he and Paul... - Paul? - Yeah, the landlord, Or my aunt's husband, He and the neighbor guy, They were staring at each other. Like there was some kind of bad history there. Well, that should be fun. And the master bedroom is locked. So weird. Anyway, I should probably get to sleep. - Bye, girl. - Bye. Hello? Hey. Jesus! - Dude, you scared me. - I know, I'm sorry. I knocked and I... And I said something. And I saw you in here. I just... I just wanted to introduce myself. So you just decided to walk right in? I know. Yeah, like, not cool. I am, like, full of regret right now. I'll... I'll just leave you alone, okay? Wait, uh... I had my headphones on. That's why I didn't hear you knock. Right. That makes sense, because... Yeah. Can I... Start over and sure. Hi, I'm mad die, And I will be staying here for a couple months. - Grace is my aunt. - Oh, very cool! Uh, I'm Kevin. I'm your... Neighbor. I guess you already knew that. Wow. You know, the depths and detail are really, uh, Quite impressive. Yeah, and then, my parents left, And I've been here ever since. I manage a few rental properties in the area. It's pretty easy. It's been good. That's cool. Does it ever get lonely out here? Yeah. Yeah, it does. Well, maybe you won't be so lonely anymore. Yeah, maybe. Well, hey, if you ever need anything, You know where I live. Is that why you stopped by? Huh? Oh, no, no. I I was gonna ask you if you'd seen my cat. He's gray, got stripes, pink collar with "jazzy" on it. - Jazzy? - Mm-hmm. I haven't seen a cat, But I was hearing a bunch of strange noises last night. - You can set that down. - Oh, right, um... Well, some of that might have been me. I was looking for jazzy out back. Sorry, but noises are just a part of this place. You know, we got raccoons, skunks, snakes, you name it. That doesn't sound too safe for jazzy. Exactly. I mean, you know, he could hold his own, But I like to check in with him every once in a while. Well, if I see him, I'll be sure to give you a holler. Okay. Oh... Thank you for my picture. Oh, hey, uh, The other day when you were working on your car, When my aunt left, you and... You were looking at, uh... Yeah? Nothing. Never mind. Crushed, like it was ran over by a semi truck ten times. That sucks. Are you gonna get a new one? I don't really have the money for that right now. Besides, there's no wi-fi. What? That's crazy. I know, right? I guess I'll just have to find. Other ways to entertain myself. Speaking of, I met the neighbor, And he's so cute! Like a puppy. He's also a landlord, and he named his cat jazzy. How cute is that? Oh, god, here goes mad die again falling in love. What? I just said he's cute, that's all. Anyway, did you ask him. Why he was staring down your aunt's husband like that? I was going to, but then I chickened out. Ask him. I mean, it might have something to do with your aunt. I know, I know, I will. All right, I gotta go, girl. - Bye! - Bye. Hello? Anyone there? Jazzy? Kitty, is that you? Your daddy's looking for you. Paul! What are you doing here? I just thought I'd stop by and see how things are going. Fine, but can't you give me a heads up. When you're coming over, or ring the doorbell? Why would I? I have the key. Did you or did you not spill wine on this pillow? I-I'm so sorry. I tried to get it out. I'll pay to have it cleaned or whatever. I'm gonna go put some clothes on, okay? You do that. Hey, Paul? I thought you left! Is everything okay? Why wouldn't it be? I smelled something weird, Like lavender maybe? I-I just used the, uh... Bathroom? I lit a candle, I was trying to... Be polite, you know. Okay, that's cool. So, are you just gonna leave it on or what? Don't go in there, that's our... It's a special place. Sure thing. By the way, did you, uh, Did you turn up the thermostat? Yeah. A couple degrees. No. You turned it up three degrees, Not a couple. It needs to stay at 65, or... Sixty-five. Sorry, I was cold. Maybe you should stop prancing around in your underwear. Is there anything else I need to take care of around here? Repair? Maybe more... More wine stains, huh? No, I don't think so. All right. Oh, I, uh, met the neighbor, Kevin. You know, if I were you, I'd stay away from him. You found me! Lucky, my gps disconnected like five miles from here. Oh, I know, it's the worst. Jazzy? Is that boy-toy? Hey, Kevin. Oh, hey! This is my friend Layla. Hi, Layla, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Have you found jazzy yet? No, I was just looking for him. I'm starting to worry. I'll keep an eye out. See ya. Take another one, and make me look good this time. Gorgeous. He is so cute. If you don't take advantage of that while you're here, I will disown you and come and do it myself. I didn't come here to get a boyfriend. Well, no one said anything about getting a boyfriend. Layla! This place is so nice. Yeah, it is. But... It gets a bit creepy at night. I don't know, I I feel like there's always someone watching me. Shut up! I do. You'll never guess what happened this morning. I came out of the bathroom, And Paul was just sitting there like a creep. The husband? Yes, and he was like, "did you just spill wine on this pillow?" Then he slammed the door. When I mentioned kevin's name, He said to stay away from him. What? Why? I don't know, I have no idea. And then, I saw blood on his sleeve and on the door. Blood? Are you sure it wasn't the wine? I don't know, maybe, but... He was just so strange. I don't know why my aunt keeps trying with him. Like, what does she even see in him? Maybe he's just amazing in bed. Ew, Layla! That is so gross! - He might. - Oh! Not bad for a biology dropout. Ooh! Oh, this is cool. Looks like some kind of diary. It needs a key though. The keys! Try one of these. Okay, I think I know which one it is. - Let's see. - Uh, I don't know. Oh, come on, it's okay. Oh, look: "I came back early." To find Paul and kaycee lounging on the couch. Paul seemed to move further away from her when she saw me. I don't think anything was going on, but it was still odd. Kaycee's just so young, "And I don't think Paul would ever cheat on me." Okay, we can't, this is my aunt's. Oh, come on. It's okay, come on, just one more. Just read it. "I asked Paul if he wanted to go to the movies tonight, And he said no again. He just hasn't been the same since kaycee left." Hmm. Okay, that's enough. You're lame! I wonder who kaycee is. Maybe her? Maybe. Tell me how it goes with Kevin! Stop! See you later. Hope I don't get lost. Drive safe. Bye, girl! Bye! Kevin? Answer. Hello? Paul, thank god. Maddie, what's wrong? I-I-I was just taking a bath, and, I don't know, Blood just started coming out of the faucet. Blood? Are you sure? Yes! I think I know blood when I see it! Why would blood be in the pipes? You sure you're not on your period, mad die? No! Can't you just come figure it out? It's 11 o'clock at night, mad die. Paul, please! Aunt grace said, if I need anything, to just call you. Mad die, why don't you just clean yourself off, And I'll come over in the morning. Good night, mad die. So, what was it? Oh, the darnedest thing. I don't know how it happened, but some animals. Must've gotten into the septic tank. Some animals? I was taking a bath in animal blood? Yeah, there was fur all over the place, too. Oh, um, yeah, I found this. Jazzy? Yeah, I did the best I could to clean it all up, But, uh, you know, if I were you, I'd let the water run a bit and cycle through. Thanks, Paul. I I'm sorry I called you so late. I-I just saw the blood, and I freaked out. It's all right. Did you get lost in there? It's been like forever. I was just cleaning up. Do you know who this is in the photo? Yeah, that's kaycee. Kaycee? Who's she? She's a model that aunt grace used in all of her photo shoots. She was from new Orleans. Where is she now? I don't know. Do you, uh, you need anything else? No, that's it. Lonely already? Come in. I didn't just walk in this time. No, but you did scare me a bit. Well, what do you think? I've got pizza, wine. You wanna pop on the big game? Pizza, yes. Wine, hell yes. But the game? I don't have a tv. Oh, right, I forgot you don't have a tv here. Well, we can just go back to my place. I've got an antenna. Or... Maybe we can just enjoy each other's company? Okay, but you have to randomly throw. The word "football" in every few sentences. Okay, deal. Um, I'll go open the wine. - You can sit. - Oh, thank you. Yeah, so, my mom and grace. Never really got along. I think she always resented that grace was so carefree, And she didn't want her to influence me. Well, that kinda backfired, didn't it? What about your dad? He... Ran off when I was two. No idea where he's at. Anyway, I tried to follow in my mom's footsteps. And become a nurse, but have you ever taken courses. Like microbiology or physiology? Um, not in the last few hours. Well, they're super hard. So, when my mom passed away last year, I realized that I was just doing it for her, And it was never really for me. Photography is my passion. Just like your aunt, Except she's not training to be a paparazzi photographer. Like you. That was one photo! What'd you do with it, by the way? Oh, it's definitely going on my Christmas card. So, thank you, yeah. - I'll take a better one. - Okay. So, um, how's Paul? Fine. - Why? - Oh, just asking. I mean, I just see his truck. Outside your place a couple times. You don't like him, do you? Why do you say that? I saw the way. You were looking at him when I first came. Paul was always a nice guy, until... Until what? He just, uh, changed. When? Him and your aunt used to rent out the spare room. To really anybody who needs it, And then all of a sudden, they just stopped. After... Kaycee left? Yeah. Wait, how do you know that? Uh, I, um, I saw her photos in my aunt's portfolio. Right. Did you know her? Yeah. Uh, kinda, I mean, I I met her like once or twice. I don't know what happened to her, um... Sorry, what was you... What were you asking about? Oh, Paul, right, um, We really haven't said anything to each other. Since we had a bit of a... Disagreement. About what? I don't remember. Yeah, paul's definitely something else. I still don't know what to make of him. Oh, and that blood in the bath tub I told you about, He said it came from dead animals. In my septic tank or whatever. What? Wait, wait, wait, could that have been ja oh, no. It wasn't a cat, it was, uh... Raccoons. Oh, okay, okay. But wait, in the septic tank though? I don't think that's possible. That's... that's what he said. Hey, you okay, mad die? Yeah. Sorry. Football. Where'd you get that iPod? In the drawer. In the guest bedroom. There's some really cool music on it. - What's wrong? - Uh I should just be going, um wait, is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, no, it's... it's... Fine. I just, um... It's been a while. Yeah. But I'll, uh, see you tomorrow, yeah? Paul? Are you in there? Oh my god! What are you doing? You're naked! I was out and about, it got late, So I just thought I'd crash here. You can't do that! I was quiet. Did you hear me come in? No, but you just can't freely come in and out. As you please, even if it's your house! Well, your aunt grace told me. She wanted me to check in on you, so... No, I don't need you to! I'm fine, I'm really, really, really fine! Jeez, you're naked, Paul! Can't you just leave? What do you want? I just I want you to be cool with mad die is all. Why do you care? You know why. When are you gonna get it through your thick skull? I had nothing to do with kaycee leaving. When I get answers, Paul. - Naked? - Yes, and I'm pretty sure he may have been in my room last night. You need to call and tell your aunt about him. I have, but her phone keeps going to voicemail. What about a hotel or... A hotel? I have $50 to my name. You could stay with Kevin. I told aunt grace I would take care of the house. I can't just leave. - So then... - I mean, I told Paul. To never come back here. I... I guess we'll just have to see what happens now. - You think he's going to listen? - Do I have a choice? Hey, Kevin! - Hey! - Hey. - What are you doing? - I'm just snapping some photos. Oh, nice. I had a really great time last night. Me too. I'm sorry that I had to bolt out of there. - I just... - It's okay. Um... I I have to come clean about something. It wasn't just raccoons found in the septic tank. It was your cat too, jazzy. - What? - I am so sorry. I just didn't want to see you get upset. I appreciate that, um... How do you know it was jazzy? Paul said there was fur all over the place. In the septic tank? You know what a septic tank is, right? No. Sorry, why? Just doesn't make sense. Why would he lie about that? I've gotta go. Are you sure? If you wanna talk, or get your mind off things, You can always stay. This time it was just a cat, mad die. What does that mean? Nothing. No, I... I meant, it's... Hey, I'll see you later, okay? Hello? Hello? I'm in here! Maddie? I'm in the bathroom! The ac was on full blast. What? I keep cranking that thing up. It has a mind of its own. Anyways, thanks for opening the door. It's a good thing I came over. You know, I brought some wings. Thanks. Um... Will you... Stay with me tonight? I'm not really feeling safe here. Uh, sure. Thanks. Will you get the light? Oh, yeah, of course. Kevin? Are you still here? Hey, it's just me. Come here. How do you feel? Better, but... Where did you go? I just couldn't get comfortable. I mean, that room... The bed is just really small. You wanna come up to my place? I've got a queen. Or we can just try to get into the master bedroom. There's a queen in there. What do you think? It's just an idea. Yeah, let's do it. I found a set of keys, but none of them worked. Well, let me have a go at it. I haven't slept that good in a while. You know, I think I'm gonna start staying in here. From now on. I don't care what Paul thinks. That sounds like a plan. What are you lookin' for? I have no idea, But Paul comes in here a lot. Find anything? No, I mean, Everything seems normal enough. But why lock the door? Why not just put a sign on it? Would a sign have stopped you? I mean, a lock didn't. You're right. Stop! - What? - Oh my god. What happened? Did you leave the door open last night? No! No, I don't think so. Oh no. Maddie, I am so sorry. Do you think animals could have done this? Honestly? I don't know. I mean, this is the chicken I left over last night. If it was animals, they would've gotten to this, right? Oh my god. That's weird. Only your photos are ripped up and none of your aunt's. You're right. I think this was Paul. Why would he trash his own place and my photos? And a lot of your clothes. He's trying to run you out. - Why? I didn't do anything. - Just think about it. I mean, your crushed cell phone, Jazzy in the septic tank, The bathroom door knob, The thermostat that has a mind of its own, And now this? Look, just for now, why don't you come stay with me? A little too soon, Kevin. Okay, I don't mean it like that. I just mean... To stay safe. No. I'm not gonna let him beat me. I'm gonna catch him. Come on. Oh, okay. Okay, so, I'm gonna set it on a time lapse. Aunt grace used to do this on our family holidays. When I was little, and you can see the decorations. Going up and the lights flickering on and off. You wanna capture us. Cleaning up this mess to test it? Yeah. Hi! Oh my gosh! I love the hair! Thank you! Let's get you some wine, girl. Oh, here's something. "They make such a cute couple. It almost feels like kismet. That I was able to bring them together." Who's they? She wouldn't have said that about Paul. Ew. Keep reading. There has to be more juice in there somewhere. I mean, most of it is about her photography, People she meets, travels. Did you know she's been to japan? Mm-mm. Oh wait, I found something else. "Kevin came over to confront Paul today." For whatever reason, Kevin thinks Paul. Had something to do with kaycee leaving, Like scaring her... Or even hurting her. I don't believe that. I do think it's strange that she would just up and leave, But people are funny that way, and when kaycee first arrived, "It always felt like she was just passing through." Kevin and kaycee. They used to be a couple. Not Paul and kaycee? I don't know. Maybe they had an affair too? That would explain why Kevin might've felt a certain way, If he had known. Maybe that's why kaycee left. I mean, judging from all these entries, That's almost a year ago. Oh, I found something else. "New Orleans." That's where kaycee said she's from. She's turning out to be my favorite model. She's so full of life. I know Paul has a little crush on her. I mean, who wouldn't? They have the new Orleans connection. "It's all harmless though." Okay, we gotta figure this out. Hello, kaycee. Paul, this is kaycee irwin. She's gonna be renting the guest room. Oh, that's good. Uh, where you from, kaycee? New Orleans. I grew up there. Yeah, I love the music, love the food. We're gonna have to cook you up something spicy. - Oh, yes. - That would be amazing. Have a seat. So, um, we don't have wi-fi, And it's an old house, so... Beautiful, okay, hold it right there. Oh, that's gorgeous, hold it there. Lift the flowers up a little bit. Hey, Paul! You like my wig? Yeah, it's really cute. What are you doing down here? Oh, I just thought I'd get some fresh air, Come down and see how the session's going. You never visit my sessions. That's 'cause you're usually taking pictures. Of ugly people like me. Oh, Paul, you're far from ugly. Oh, that's beautiful, right there, hold it. One, two, three. Hey, I'm s... I'm sorry. - Oh. - Sorry, Didn't mean to bother you. I'm Kevin. I live in that house over there. I'm kaycee. It's a pleasure to meet you, kaycee. You just moved in? I did, yeah. Welcome to the neighborhood. How long are you gonna be staying here? No idea, just I like it here. I love you. You know that. Right? I had a whole plan for us. What are you doing? Kaycee. Get out! Oh my god! Yeah, I'm almost done. You got a kitten? You named him jazzy? I love that, that's so cute! Yeah, I will be right there. I just have to tell Paul and grace. Okay, bye. Tell Paul and grace what? Was... was that Kevin? Oh, hey, yeah, um, I'm moving in with him. We're in love. But I'm the one who's in love with you. I'm... Flattered, seriously, But, you know, you're married. Oh, no, no, no, that's been over for a long time now, yeah. Uh, yeah, that doesn't matter. Uh, you just need to give us a chance. I'm... I'm so sorry. Hey, no, no, no, stay here. Stay here, just stay here with me. Let go! No, no, no, please, please! I need you here with me, please. I don't love you! Get off! Look what you made me do. No one will ever come between us, kaycee. No one. I love you, kaycee. Hey! Hey, leave her alone! What are you talkin' about? I know exactly what you're up to. Her phone, the bathroom door, all of it. And you killed jazzy, didn't you? - You, you are sick. - Jazzy? Yes, don't pretend like you don't remember. Kaycee's cat, jazzy. I bought him a real nice rock, okay, real nice stone, Even had it engraved, and I had to bury that collar. In the field out back! Listen, Paul, I don't know what you're up to, But you drove kaycee to run away, And now you're trying to do the same to mad die. Okay, Kevin... You really wanna know what happened to kaycee? So, what are you up to tomorrow? I don't know, I think I might just like go on a hike. And clear my head. Are you sure? I wouldn't hike out here alone. I'll be fine. If Paul tries to creep or trash his house again, I'll have proof to show my aunt. Okay. Just be careful, And you might want to take that wig off. You know what, you can have it. Oh, gee, thanks! Let's see. I'll keep looking through this, See if I find anything else, okay? Call me. I found something else in the diary. "Today was the annual fall festival, And I baked the perfect dutch apple pie, But I wasted my time since I never ended up going. I was visited by my good friend, psychiatrist dr. Fernando avila, Who agreed to meet with Paul since he seemed to be. In such a depressive mood ever since kaycee left. Fernando said that Paul was suffering from a combination. Of delusional jealousy and erotomania. Where Paul believed that kaycee. May have had strong feelings for him in return. Once she left, his heart was broken, And time will only tell how long it will take to mend. Paul did apologize to me for his behavior, "But I'm not sure I'll ever be able to recover." I wonder if... if she knows how crazy he really is. Oh, I found one more thing. I was curious, so I looked up dr. Fernando avila, And the only one that came up. Passed away three days after the journal entry. Listen to this: "Investigators say dr. Fernando avila died. From carbon monoxide poisoning from his gas-powered furnace. At the time his body was found, All carbon monoxide detectors were reportedly unplugged." Oh, do you think Paul had something to do with that? Maybe. I do think there's something with kaycee. That paul's holding onto. That's why he won't let your aunt sell the house. Maddie, he's hoping kaycee returns one day! Unless... Unless what? Unless she's... Unless she's already there. What? Layla, like she's dead? What? You're really starting to freak me out. Just be careful. I'm gonna keep looking to see if I find anything else. You should ask Kevin too. Okay, I will. I'm gonna call you, so pick up. Bye. Who is it? Who is it? Maintenance, there's a leak in the apartment below you. I think it's coming from your bath tub. Do you guys have normal hours? Iookie here. Imagine that, everything... About me, right in this little book. You know, it's hard to make a marriage work. When there's no forgive-and-forget. You know, uh, People take landlords for granted. Yeah, they think they're just around to fix things, But do you know what else they do? They save lives. Kevin? Kevin, it's mad die. I brought you some coffee. I kinda wanted to talk to you a little about, um... Kaycee. Are you mad at me? Hey, listen, I'm gonna go hiking and take some photos. Layla? Come on, Layla. I'm sure it was you. Hello? Oh, hey, hey, grace. So great to hear your voice. Yeah, how's Africa? What? Really? When? That's, uh, wonderful news. Yeah. No, I don't know why mad die wouldn't pick up her phone. Well, maybe she's outside. Voicemails? I don't know... Look, last time I checked on her, she was just doing great. Yeah, well, she'll be excited to see you. Yeah. As will I. Welcome back, mad die. Kevin. Kevin?! Enough playing games. Hey, mad die! How ya doin'? I gotta hand it to ya, You sure made this game fun. I mean, really. I really thought you would've run away by now, But I guess you got a pretty high tolerance. Because you don't have to pay rent! Oh, looks like you found good old Kevin! I got kinda tired of him. He was gettin' on my nerves. Yeah, he was always snoopin' around, Stickin' his nose where it shouldn't be, Kinda like you. What's it gonna be, mad die? Carbon monoxide poisoning? Maybe a fall from a high ladder, huh? That'd break your neck. Stay away from me, Paul! What have you done? What do you mean? Have you hurt kaycee? Kaycee? What are you talking about? Where is she? Did you kill her? You hurt her, didn't you? You hurt her! Oh my god. No, Layla. Stop! - What did you do to Layla? - That was your fault, mad die. You should've never gotten her involved. And kaycee was fine until you started meddling! It's always been about kaycee, hasn't it? Oh, no, I just wanted her here, where she belongs. She was running from an abusive relationship, And I was taking care of her! - And what about Kevin? - Everything was fine. Till he came into the picture. He was taking her away from me! You need to stop this, Paul! And my poor aunt? You've been using her this whole time. You need help! No, I'm sorry, I can't let kaycee go. She needs someone to take care of her. She needs someone who will love her. That person can only be me. That's for Layla. That's for Kevin. That's for kaycee. Okay, ma'am, we have units arriving to the location. Just stay in the house, keep the door locked, And stay on the phone. Just stay with me. You're going to be fine. Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Okay, stay with us. - I'll be right here. - Just stay on the phone. - Thank you. - You're going to be fine. You're free now, kaycee. What's happening? Paul, what have you done? Maddie. Oh my god. It's okay. - Oh god. - It's okay. I'm fine. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I didn't think you were gonna make it. I almost didn't. I got so nervous, I almost threw up. Listen, no matter what happens today, I really think you should give college another shot. Make your mom happy. Actually, I found a photography school. That might work. I'm really proud of you. Thanks, aunt grace. I love you so much. Oh.
