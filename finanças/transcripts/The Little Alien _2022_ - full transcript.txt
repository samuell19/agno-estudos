But this is crazy! You know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. It's too much at the moment. It won't be "too much" for him knowing that his mom can't cope with him? I can't keep having this conversation again and again. How do you tell your kid that you're getting divorced? - I don't know. - And if you can't, then I'll have to. Are you also going to tell him that he has to live somewhere else? Is he awake? What if he heard it? Stop, stop, stop... Stop. - I'm all alone. - How do we tell him about the divorce? What if I never get any new friends? Maybe I'm being a handful. Doesn't she care about me? LITTLE ALLAN Turn it down! Well, it doesn't look too impressive, but... I'm sure there are many kids here. Probably in the other court or inside. I'm sorry! I was reading my horoscope. I was looking more inward than outward. - Are you okay? - That adds some spirit. We'll cover it over with a good lick of paint or a nice quote. Forget that. We just need it on the second floor to the left. Number 47. Seriously? Number 40... I live at number 74 over at Towergrove Road. 7-4, 4-7, eh? I think the universe is trying to tell us something. The universe is telling me quite a bit these days. It keeps babbling. I yell, "Can we get some peace and quiet?" But only in jest. Yes, yes... Oh my God! They're here. I've moved so much stuff up and down these stairs I almost feel at home here. In a way, I leave a little piece of myself with all the people I help move. A piece of Ruth. I'm doing it again! Those boxes won't move by themselves. And I meant these boxes! Stop me, for God's sake! I can keep... - You coming? - Yes. - We'll arrive first. Eh, Dad? - Yes. Let me see what I can carry here. Like I always say: Moving house is a clean-up, both outwards and inwards. Your energy tells me that a clean-up might be a good thing. Sorry, that's just my personality. I'm sensitive to my customers' signals. - With you, it's down in the dumps. - No, no. I'm fine. I can tell that you'd really like a box with "Mom" on it. Am I right? Yes... Or no. I... I'm only staying here for the summer holidays. My mom just got a new job. She got a top job at Mug, Jug & Plate. And that's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Later on, I'll spend ten days with my dad here and four days with my mom in... No, let me say it straight: Shouldn't this wall be yellow? Yellow is a difficult, but brave color, and I sense that your dad's a brave man. I think you need some sunlight all the way in your living room. I breathe through light and love, and I think you guys need that. Should we get some color samples? Greenish yellow would look nice here. Or we could take a chance with a burnt orange. Would that be too much? Maybe we should wait with the paint. Do you like it? Yes... It's going to be really nice. Ups. Where did that come from? Welcome to øren Ryge Live. Another beautiful late summer evening. It's happening now... This is Kate from Mug, Jug & Plate. This is my answering machine. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Bye! Hi, Mom. I just wanted to say... hi. And tell you that I'm doing fine here. Dad's fine too. Tomorrow I'm going to look for other kids here, and... And I miss you. Since I met you here, Leonard - - I'm not just a girl anymore. Dad doesn't get it. We've become two branches on the same tree - - with new leaves. Nothing can separate us. Oh my God! They are here now, Missy! Awesome! - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - Teddy can't poop with people looking. - No. I'm sorry. It's a very nice dog. Come, Teddy. Let's find a place where you can poop in peace. Yes, yes. Maybe... DO NOT DISTURB Hello? Stop. Ouch! You almost look human, but you won't fool this vice president that easily! You're a scout from an alien invasion fleet - - who has taken on human form. Yeah, I know all your tricks! - Did you come from beyond? - Originally, I came from a small town. Don't try anything. I have a big dog in here, and it's very hungry. I'm not trying anything. I'm Little Allan. Sure thing, "Allan". Alien! Since you arrived, there's been strange activity. Constant signals! - Is that a bad thing? - What is your purpose here? - I just want to find some playmates. - There's no playing here. Just go home! But I can't. My mom's busy. She got a new job at Mug, Jug & Plate. And that's not just a job. It's a way of life. An alien with detailed knowledge about the Mug, Jug & Plate shops. Very strange. Maybe you're not the alien. - Yes... - Can I go now, then? Sure... If you want to miss out on a grand experience. I have an idea, and it's amazing. Cracker? - Thanks. - Have a seat. Two seconds max. For almost 20 years - - I've moved the antennae around in vain to make contact with outer space. As soon as you arrived, the signals started coming! Your presence here obviously attracts extra-terrestrial signals. - You're special. - Huh? I believe that you're a human antenna! - Do you understand? - Yes... No. I'll have 50 tinfoil rolls delivered from the supermarket - - that we'll wrap around you and then connect you to a wiring system. Then we'll hoist you up on the roof, connected to my even higher antennae - - and then we'll communicate with them using our brain waves! It all begins at 11 PM tonight, little Antenna. - I'd better head home. - Look at me, Antenna! An invasion fleet is headed our way. This is for the very survival of Earth. It's for your mom, for your dad. It's... for Missy. - For whom? - For Missy. - What's your name? - Missy. No, Walt. Nice to meet you, Walt. I'd better get back home. Do you swear that you'll come? Swear on Missy. I swear... on Missy. Nice. I'll see you at 11 PM, little Antenna. Don't be late. Of course not. Sorry! Awesome! - Did something happen, honey? - No, no. I'm fine. They look like this. The amazing thing about dahlias is that there are - - not hundreds, but thousands of different sorts. From the tiniest ball to some that are the size of a plate. I've had those every year. Finally, little Antenna. We can't miss the invasion. No... Yes. I know precisely how we're going to do this. See, we'll take this... Here... Lift your arms... No. Yes! - There! - Have you ever been an antenna? If only I'd had that honor. But now, that's out of the question. Due to my chronic shin inflammation. I can't leave my flat. Okay. What if they see all that tinfoil and think I'm a giant packed lunch? I happen to know from some confidential archival material - - that they don't use lunch packs at all... in outer space. Okay... Now we're getting there... Like that. Yes, yes, yes. There! What if the aliens ask me questions? - Well, they won't. - But what if they do? I've been the vice president of Towerville UFO Club for almost 17 years. Obviously, they're not going to talk to the antenna! But if it is an invasion fleet - - then it's likely that they'll try to destroy us with a sonic implosion. - That sounds dangerous. - Exactly! That's why this is important. For the future of this planet, little Antenna. And for Missy. Of course. Who is Missy actually...? Missy was the most beautiful creature in this world, Antenna. - I think... - I'm not the only one who says that. We'd have to go far outside this galaxy to find a similar beauty. Her golden time was the seven years we lived in Sweden - - where she lived as a man to compete against the best in ski jumping. She called herself öran Petterson. The world was watching - - when the last jump pitted öran, that is Missy... Oh my God! Are you up there? Vice president calling human antenna. What is your status? Over. What is your status? Over. Antenna here. No aliens. Over. - Perfect. Can you see anything? - No. Or yes. A man with a dog. - Has he spotted you? - I don't think so. People tend to frown at the use of human antennae, you see. Try to take on more of an antenna-esque shape. Over. Okay... Yes. Amazing. And now... Now we just wait. Human antenna calling the vice president. Over. If it wouldn't be too much trouble - - I think I'd like to get down now. It's raining a lot. Walt? I have a dog! Oh no, no! Antenna? Little Antenna! Unbelievable! Come on. Come on, you stupid, lousy UFO! I should've never come down here! I'll never be in time for my presentation. You... You saved me. Welcome to "Talking to Earthlings for Beginners". "Good evening. How's your ca... your family and career?" - What? - "Lovely evening." "We don't meet often. Let's have a coffee soon." Try the new travel guide to... "I'd like to be alone due to problems at home." - Okay. What's your name? - Really...! "My name is Obama." "I'm from Silkeborg. My hobbies are fish and the internet." My name's Little Allan. I'm from a small town, and I like fish too. And I like badminton because of the fancy outfits. I see. But I guess you must get going? Crap! - You never saw a thing, Little Allan! - No! I won't say a thing. I'll be in big trouble if you tell anyone. Just leave quietly and don't utter a word to anyone. Yes... Can you smell something, Teddy? Running, running, running... You're in such a hurry. - What are you doing? - Helping you. You saved me too. - Did you catch a scent? - Down here! Come on, camouflage. Where are we going, little darling? No... No, Teddy, are you seeing what I'm seeing? No... Look at this. Yes... Something was here for sure. Yes, Teddy darling. I know. That's odd... - Oh no... This is not happening. - What? Very strange... Teddy! You can't just hang there in mid-air. - Help! The camouflage is broken. - What on earth...? No! Daddy's little Teddy darling! Come on. Follow me. - Where are we going? - Hurry! We'll hide over there. - Why couldn't you leave me be? - I wanted to help. You saved me. Only because of the project! It's two days till my presentation. No one's ever travelled to another solar system to do a school project! You wouldn't get it, but I know it'll be the very best thing in my class. - No. He took it! - What? - My UFO! Why did he do that? - I don't know. - There he is! - Can't you use your ray gun? I mean without hitting them? - It's just a pencil sharpener. - What? A pencil sharpener! What are you waiting for? After him! We'd better go to Walt's flat. He's been vice president of a UFO Club. - So I guess you know him? - No. I don't know a thing about the boy who fell from the roof! - But it's me, the antenna. - Have you come from the other side? No, I'm from a small town. Walt... This is Obama. - My name's actually Britney. - Britney? Britney, Walt. Walt, Britney. Walt? Walt? Here we go. A little TV, perhaps? But Father, I'd do anything to win her hand. No peasant girl gets to live at this castle as long as I'm alive! - Would you like a cup too? - Sure... Maybe just half a cup. There you go. A little dip. Wow. Stop! Not Missy. That's mine! I knew it. This is the spearhead of the invasion fleet, Antenna. We're doomed. - Stop! It's a pencil sharpener, Walt. - No! I'm too young to be sharpened. No one will be sharpened. Be calm. He's harmless. - What's he doing with his hands? - Surrendering. - Be careful. She can read our minds! - No. Can't you read each other's minds? I can if I want to. - Do you want to? - I don't know. Maybe. - Doesn't she care about me? - How do you tell your kid...? Knowing that his mom can't cope with him? Missy... Contact has been established, Antenna. Stop! He doesn't like it. It's just her feature week about Earth. She saved me when I fell. But she crashed, and a man took her spaceship. She can't go home now. - What can I do about that? - We have to do something. I think he lives in the basement. He was a big man with a small dog. - Oh my God! That's Bjarne, our janitor. - Is he a bad man? No, just incompetent. He hasn't fixed the noisy water pipe in my kitchen. - No, it's rather... his brother. - "Towerville UFO Club's new president." We need to get to that spaceship before he does. Patrick, that arsehole! Shake, shake, shake... Yes, it's hard to choose. My, look at that. You're so cute. My little, lovely friend. On the shelf you go. Now you can greet me from there. Oh my, how it's ringing. Telephone for my... the private collector. - The private collector speaking. - This is Bjarne. What do you want, bro? You're calling at a bad time. I'm just stuffing a little goodnight squirrel. I'll be damned! - Miss Daisy, it has happened! - Has it? We can finally find the answer. Does life exist in outer space? And can it be stuffed? This is so exciting! That looks damn gorgeous, Miss Daisy! I must say. Can I tempt you with a night-time massage as well? This is my dog. It's been on telly all his life. For 11 years now. We have an agreement... - Where are you going? - Just to see my friends. - You've already made friends? - Yes. - You're handling this so well. - See you later, okay? Strange. I've never seen him use his fancy tablecloth. - Maybe he's having guests. - The janitor only has his Teddy. That's his dog. Teddy must be walked at 12:15 AM every day. That usually only takes a few minutes, but lately Teddy has had stomach issues. - Stomach issues? - Constipation. Difficulty pooping. - You know... Poop. - What a shame. That gives you guys at least 15 minutes to get the UFO. I can't give you the castle, but I can give you my heart. You had your chance at the harvest festival. You had your chance at the harvest festival. She's moved on to the finer porcelain. Missy loved that set. This will look nice. Let's hope Patrick can eat some sponge cake. And a French fry for you, Teddy. You want more fries? Huh? French fries! Well, I guess it's time for your walk. There he is! The coast is clear. The time is now! Is that a good spot? Is this where you want to poop? Well? Yes, just smell around. - Let's move on, Teddy. - That's it. Human antenna calling the vice president. We're in. - Amazing! Can you locate the spaceship? - Spaceship located. Lovely, kids. This is going frigging great! Yes, yes! Yes. Oh my God! I'll be right there, dear. Imagine living like this. You wouldn't think we were related. Disgusting! No one has class like you. Oh my God... Patrick. There's an emergency situation. - Hurry up! - We're almost ready. Hurry! Our time is short. Bro, Miss Daisy. Lovely to see you. We're just doing something here - - but afterwards we can have sponge cake. We're not having any damn sponge cake here. Show it to me! But Teddy and I might want to talk about a reward. Teddy loves French fries, and they are expensive. Everyone can have fries when I have that creature. Yes, yes. Of course. I have its flying saucer in the basement. We just need to... - Just... - That's quite a liberty to take. Can't you guys step back a bit? Teddy can't do it with people looking. I can assure you we aren't looking. Just... Just, just... Come on! - What's your lucky number? - 318,020,073... Let me try my birthday. Keep it inside. Ouch. Yes, it hurts now, but I promise you'll feel relieved afterwards. Stop talking to that dog as if it were a person. It's bloody annoying! You seem a bit strained from all this family time... Not now! If I lose the ultimate object in the ultimate collection due to this - - they'll both end up on my wall. No discussion! - That is only just. - Something's happening! Keep it inside, Teddy. You can do it! Oh no... Wait. If that mutt doesn't poop within the next five seconds - - I'll gut it and tear every last poop out of it! - That might just be a tad too... - Five, four, three, two... - Okay. - Holy cow! Well done. Good dog! Antenna, Teddy is empty. I repeat: Teddy is empty. They're on their way back! - We have to go! - Perhaps we can... - Are you sure that's a good idea? - Yes, it always works with lasers. We have to leave before they get here. No, not the sponge cake! - Come. This way. - After them! Get them, Miss Daisy! - Walt, they're after us! - Patrick can't get her. - What should we do? Come! - Hurry over to the old UFO club. Towerville UFO Club. It's been abandoned for years. - You can hide there. - But how...? I got it. In the box! "Be aware of what's right in front of you." You don't have to tell me twice! - Is that Little Allan from number 47? - I need something moved in a hurry! I know how you feel. No, no... No! Ouch! - Like that. Let's go rock 'n' roll! - Hurry up! I love that kind of enthusiasm. I can't get enough of it. Let's go! After them! Hey, bro. No. Wait! Wait! Teddy, Teddy, Teddy! Ouch! Where are we taking the box? - To... - 4 Tulip Road. - 4 Tulip Road. - Right. "Faith can move mountains." "The rest is up to Ruth's Boxes." That's a slogan! Speaking of nails, is your father hammering in nails at home? Yes, he's busy with... the decor. The flat's going to be nice. He had a very strong energy in that room. He's a Gemini, right? I was thinking of dropping by with a couple of cold ones, to offer my help. If he can save a couple of boxes for me! - Can you go a bit faster? - That moving energy is rare. Have you considered a job in the removal business? - I might. - Keep it in the back of your mind. - Sure. - Thinking about your future job. - Miss Daisy, step on it! - Fifth gear. Bravo! Hold on to your hats and collar! Hold tight, Teddy. How does being little in a brand-new place feel? - Fine. Actually, it's going swell. - You have a kind of closed energy. A difficult box to open. You're Aquarius, right? - Is there another way? - You're right. I went too far. They're getting away. That's no way to drive! - Are you okay? We have to hide here. - But I have to get back home! We can't go back for your spaceship. We must wait until they've left. Come. TOWERVILLE UFO CLUB - My presentation is tomorrow! - If they find you, you won't get home. Well... You never did a presentation yourself? Britney... Britney, look at that. "Vice president". Oh... "President"? - What does it say? - "Top... secret". What does it mean? It means something very secret that you can't tell anybody. I hope we can be friends. If you'd like to be my friend, why don't you just say so? - Antenna calling the vice president. - I have a dog! Antenna calling the vice president! We're safe in the UFO club. That is lovely! And I'm alert, keeping an eye on... on... - Walt? - Oh no, no... - Oh no! - What's happening? Nothing. Everything's good. - Wow. Was that me? - No. Look! This is my favorite fish. I think much of the project will be about dolphins. Mostly them. They are pretty cute. But I don't think dolphins are a fish species. - It's a mammal, I think. - I don't understand this planet! It looks like a fish. It does look amazing, with the dolphins. - That doesn't matter if it's wrong. - No, I know it will be a good project. - How do you know that? - Why's the project so important to you? Because... The others think I'm a bit weird. I don't have any school friends, but if the project turns out well - - then I can... I have to make that presentation. I'm sure they don't think you're weird. We'll get your spaceship tomorrow. - You're doing it again. - What? You pretend everything's okay when it's not. And you pretend to be happy, but you aren't. Sure, I am. I am happy. I'm all alone. - What if I never find new friends? - Divorce... - You are sad. Why not just say it? - I am happy. No, you're not. You pretend not to be sad, but you are. - I'm just trying... - Your parents' divorce makes you sad. You miss your mom and keep thinking of her saying she couldn't cope with you. - No! That's not true at all. - Then why are you thinking it? - I'm not. That's not how it is. - Just admit it. I'm handling this very well! My sign is actually Pisces. I've sensed an incredibly sensitive energy from you. That's typical Pisces. Did you know that? I'm Aries myself. Aries and Pisces. Oh my! No, sparks will fly instantly! I'm blushing here. You'd better leave. My German shepherd, King, will be home soon - - and he's not eaten for two days. - I know there's an alien here. - What are you talking about? Enough! Spit it out, vice president. That election was pure politics. You know that as well as I. You got 14 votes in a club with only 7 members. Leonard, ever since that time in the barn... I've thought of nothing else. Bad boy. The light from the stable window. Your stretched-out body. Your warm breath on my chest. I became a woman, Leonard. And nine months from now, it won't just be the two of us anymore. What on earth is that? It looks like the first issue of UFO News from 1973. - Tear it up, Bjarne! - No. No... We can also break the heater's thermostat. - It takes time getting a replacement. - Do shut up. - But they have to be custom-made. - Do it! And we've only just begun. Is that a pack of crackers? They need to be dipped in the coffee, eh? - That's a bit too much... - No, that turns them soft! You can only make it stop by telling me where you're hiding the alien. - Never! - It's your alien. I get that. However, I'm just suggesting sharing a bit. Yes, yes. I remember her. I remember when she left you. She got fed up with you spending all your time in the club... - Missy would turn in her grave if... - What grave? She lives in a residential home at Towerville Square. - Missy is dead! - No, she's not. Eh? And now you wish to prove to her that aliens exist. Am I right? Let's say you give me the alien. But you get the credit. You'll be on the UFO News cover. The great hero, Walt. The man who found life in outer space. Might Missy not return to you then? Don't do it, Walt. As long as the alien ends up on my wall, stuffed. That's a pretty fair deal, eh? Never! Not on your life. I could also send my butler, Miss Daisy, down to tell your dear Missy - - that you've turned into a slovenly old man with a comb-over - - and swollen shins, getting his food delivered from the municipality. Huh? - This is your butler speaking. - Miss Daisy, could I ask you to... Okay, okay! - But only if I can show her to Missy. - Of course. They are... in the old clubhouse. - No, Walt! - Get him! No. Stop. I'm sorry! Antenna! - We'll just talk to the boy, Teddy. - Miss Daisy, drive over here. I'm sorry, little Antenna. Hurry, Britney! They're on their way! - We made it here first. - Stay away from her! Yes, yes... And now we need to talk to your green friend in private. Stop! - Out of my way. - Stop that. Let her out! Tell the vice president the deal's off. I crossed my fingers the whole time. Me too! Double cross negates everything, right? Do shut your trap, Bjarne. - Drive, Miss Daisy. Go! - No, don't take her! Walt, come in. Come in. Human antenna calling the vice president. Come in. Come in! They took her. They took Britney. Walt, are you there? Walt? You stupid UFO nerd! Stupid club, stupid flat! Stupid... everything! Welcome, everyone, to Britney's project about planet Earth. Many creatures inhabit the Earth. For instance birds - - plaice, cats, woodlice. And dolphins. Dolphins are so cute. Clearly a favorite. Almost. Because the species taking up most space is humans. In a way, humans look a lot like us from outer space - - but one thing about them makes them different. They can't read each other's minds like us. That makes everything difficult. Check this out. Here's an Allan. Or a Little Allan, as they call this one. - Mom and I won't live together anymore. - We're getting divorced. I would go berserk in that scenario. But look at what Little Allan does. That's probably for the best. I've lived here my entire life. - I was hoping for some changes. - You're handling it so well, honey. He keeps it all hidden inside himself, and he's not the only one. Humans are concerned about what others think and hide what they think. The secrets often turn into what they call "loneliness". Loneliness makes them unhappy inside. They believe their thoughts to be wrong, so they hide them away. Stop, stop, stop... It's a pity, because that's not true. If only they could understand - - that they can only feel better by daring to express their feelings. Mom, Dad? No, stay here! Note to self: Dolphins are not fish even if they look like it. They are mammals! Searching for spaceship... Spaceship not located. - It's an antenna. - Not located. TOWERVILLE Can we discuss that reward sometime? Shut the hell up, Bjarne! Step on it, Miss Daisy. It'll be stuffing time soon! And that's my favorite time! Walt! They took her! You have to help me. - I can't. - But do you know where they took her? No. Patrick has always been very "private". - We can't just give up now. - If it wasn't for these stupid shins... - You have to help me, Walt. - But I don't know where she is. We can find out. Look. Britney's thingy is trying to contact her UFO. I think it's an antenna, and you're the antenna expert. I'm sorry. It's probably best that I stay in here... forever. Britney needs you. If you don't act, nothing happens. Just like with Missy. You know nothing about my Missy! I know you don't dare say you miss her. You fear she doesn't feel the same way. And that it will hurt too much again. I know, because I also miss... Little Antenna. We need it up high. That's what works about antennae! - Signal available. - It's working! - Come. Let's go. - Well... That... Do you still have that one? Missy! If one hooks a gorgeous fish like you, it's just about reeling you in! - "Come here!" It can't go fast enough. - I agree. Where's he going? It's late. I think he's building something in your allotment garden. We don't own an allotment garden. Go directly inside to the machine. I need to stuff it right away. - Turn right. - We need to turn? Allan? What is this place? First road in the roundabout! Amazing! Let me see it. How are we going to make this one? The tiger? Or a classic? Fetch! I feel the need to think long and hard. Your taste is always exquisite. Nice compliment, Miss Daisy. What do you think? I don't think I'm quite the right person to ask. Well... It's probably due to my childhood. Ever since Jennifer disappeared - - I've probably always had more of a preference for the living ones. Yes, we did everything together. She was there when I got bullied. When I couldn't sleep at night. When Dad called me a sissy boy. She was always there. But one day the door was open - - and Jennifer had run away. I wasn't good enough for her either. Fortunately Bjarne never found out that I stuffed Jennifer. He was never all that bright. What's going on? I'm not thinking about anything! I'm not thinking about anything at all! Get her in the machine. Pronto! - If we had time for color samples... - I'm calling Kate. Wild horses couldn't stop me. I feel like adding a little splotch. This is Kate from Mug, Jug & Plate. This is my answering machine. - This is the place. - Oh my. - It's locked! - Jump in, little Antenna. Time for a trick that Missy taught me. Britney? Patrick has always been a scary fellow. Kind of impressive too. Come on, Walt. It's this way. Britney, where are you? Well, well... No, it's empty! I'll find her. You have to get the spaceship down. - Leave this to the vice president. - Hurry up! This is always so exciting! Britney? Some music while I work would be lovely now, Miss Daisy. Yes, that's a wonderful tune. - And with a yellow umbrella. - How you spoil me. It's wonderful. For Missy! We may need to make the conveyor a bit faster next time. It could be the carburetor. Maybe we need to spin the transmission shaft. I don't give a crap! Oh no! No... There. Teddy? Go away now. Go! I'm sorry, Britney. What the hell is happening in there? Amazing! - No! - What the hell? I'm moving fast. Hush. Who do we have here? And here? Look what I found! Yes. Let's see if I can still do it by hand, the old-fashioned way. - Let's tie you up. - Are you okay? Did they hurt you? I don't know what we're going to do now. Let's see if these old hands still have what it takes. Oh yes... Get in there. Stop that. Come on... Damn it, this is so frigging annoying. Try licking it. Come on... You seem to be a bit tense. I'm not tense! I'm excited to see - - what's hidden inside such a little, new friend. It's so hard to choose. I'll take this one. Oh yes! I don't know what we're going to do now. What the hell's happening? - I can hear what you're thinking. - I've got it. Say what I'm thinking. Stop! Or I'll expose the truth about Jennifer. Stop! Or I'll expose the truth about Jennifer. - What truth about Jennifer? - There is no truth about Jennifer. Yes. Your brother stole Jennifer and stuffed her! - That's not true. - Yes, it is. See for yourself. She is in the box over on the bookcase. Daddy's coming, darling. - Jennifer! - That's not Jennifer. It's just a hamster I ran into in front of the supermarket. I made that bow for her. What is this, huh? You and that stupid hamster. You had everything. And what did I have? Which little furball loved me? Miss Daisy, violin. Didn't you think that my lonesome heart longed for a friend as well? I just wanted to borrow her. I wanted to give her everything. But the ungrateful critter whined constantly. For a whole night, she tried to get out. There was only one thing to do. Do you get it? Stuffed things never leave you. - I'll never leave you... - Don't touch me like that, Miss Daisy. - You murdered Jennifer! - Sure, but we can't change that now. And now we'll shut you up for good. No more. No one else will get stuffed here! Don't do it! Please, Bjarne! I'm so sorry! That's the wrong... lever. Smashing isn't nice! Oh no, there's more of them, damn it. No! Get out of the way, Teddy. Ouch, by Saturn! - No, don't bite. - Ouch. I'm sorry I destroyed your project... No worries. I have a backup in the spaceship. Get them away from me! Oh god, no... They are wild! What? Yes, yes. A final battle for the presidency! We should never have been in the same club. There, there, little friends. Damn it! No, ouch, ouch! I think there's some air in the pipes in my kitchen. - I'll take a look when I'm back. - Walt, come on! - Thanks. - That's what I'm here for. Get them away from me! Not like that, Miss Daisy. For Missy! I can see Sweden! Wonderful! - Reading minds is pretty smart. - I told you! The presentation... I can still make it if I leave now. - If I don't fly now, I won't make it! - What about us? - We'll just take the bus, Antenna! - Quick. I must exit the atmosphere! We'll meet in our thoughts, my green friend. - Are you just going home? - I must. I have the presentation. But... But I thought we were... - You want to say something? Say it! - But... But... I thought we were friends. Goodbye. I can't wait to get home and have coffee and a cracker. You know what? My leg doesn't hurt so much anymore. The municipality lady said it would be good for me to get out more. I didn't get to tell her that I'll miss her. I didn't say goodbye properly. No, it all went a bit fast. Now it's all the same again. Nothing ever gets better. No. But I do think she's got a point, our little green friend. - I have something to say. - What is it? It's something I should've said ages ago. Missy! Then why does he start behaving like this? It's not like him at all. - Maybe it's not just my fault! - Don't you keep an eye on him? Sure, I do! But I can't do it all the time. I'm also a human being... - Stop! - There you are, honey! Are you okay? Stop fighting! Stop! - Where have you been? - You don't care! That's not true. We do care. No, you don't! You fight constantly. You just think I'm handling it so well. No, we always care about you. No. You only care about your new job, and you sit on the sofa all the time! I heard what you told Dad. That you can't cope with me. That's not the case. You are the most precious thing we have. I know you think I'm handling it well, but I'm not. I just want it all to go away. I want things to be like before. Come here. - Why can't everything be normal again? - Maybe something will be a new normal. For all of us. Maybe this new normal will be very, very good. There, there, honey. I've looked everywhere in the area, and he's just not... Holy smokes! You're just fine right there, my friend, huh? Ruth, this is my mom. Mom, this is Ruth. She helped us move. All's well that ends well. You know what? I have a big batch of barbecue sausages I can't eat myself. Or I shouldn't eat them myself in any case! So how about we have a super lovely housewarming party up on the roof? I'm so sorry about all this, honey. - I missed you so much. - I missed you too. - I never knew you could walk up here. - Hi, Missy. Nice to meet you. - Hello, my friends. - Hi. You're so cute. - Are you my son's new friend? - Friend, collaborator, comrade. You have a wonderful kid. Cheers for you, little Antenna. Cheers! Bottoms up! Britney! - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Isn't the view beautiful? Why are you here? What about the presentation? I had some unfinished business down here first. Your party looks fun. Yes. It sure is. I'm sorry I just left. I'm sorry I didn't say a proper goodbye. It was just because... I'll miss you. I know. Luckily, we live in the same universe. Yes. Luckily. Remember to express your feelings. It's a long way down here. I can't come flying constantly to read your mind! I will. I promise. Goodbye, Britney. Goodbye, Little Allan. We'll meet again.
