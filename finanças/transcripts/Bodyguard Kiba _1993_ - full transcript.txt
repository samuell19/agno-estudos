...Coming up next: Mid to high-level winds at the end of the stormy season... ...have resulted in blackouts in some parts of the city... BODYGUARD KIBA Is there an accident? Brother, Chin's a bitch about being on time. If we're even a little bit late, the deal won't go through. Junpei, isn't there anything you can do? Yeah, if you want the cops to catch us. Just do something! They'll kill us otherwise. - Brother, there's trouble. - What is it? There was a convenience store robbery up ahead. Cops are swarming everywhere. Damn. The three of us are well-known. They'll want to do a thorough inspection. Thanks to some stupid punk, we're stuck here. What are you gonna do? Okay. Junpei, you're the only one they won't recognize. You keep going here and meet up with us after. We'll head to Chin's now. Listen, you'd better not mess this up. I'll leave the money with you. Oh, and take off your badge. Mr. Yasunaga, the burglar was caught an hour ago. The traffic cleared up an hour ago, too. Yet he's still not here. Something's strange. Yeah, maybe he got in an accident. He was definitely headed here. I've waited long enough. We're leaving. Please wait! You have a lot to make up for. Neither the heroin nor my time comes cheap. If this were Shanghai, you'd be dead by now for breaking your word. Aren't you glad it's Okinawa? Bastard. Well, this is good-bye. What on earth have you done? I've gotten us a passport to the good life. Us? Yeah. Go to the main island and hide out or something. You've put me in danger, too. Listen to me. The only way bugs like us can get a better life is to take risks. It's been fun just the way it is. You just do as I told you, okay? You have to protect yourself. Protect yourself. Junpei... We'll meet again. I promise I'll find you. Naha Police Department. Hello... Soryu Group So a car pulled up to you while you were waiting at a red light... ...and some guys in sunglasses stuck a gun through your window... ...and stole the money? Don't make me laugh. There's no one in Okinawa stupid enough to attack the Soryu Group like that. Give Yasunaga his finger back. Just admit you gave in to temptation. Junpei... Do you like violence? I hate it. How old are you? Twenty-three. You won't get anywhere by cheating. Where did you hide the 500 million yen? But, Boss, it's true. L... Shut up! Brother, it's true. Shut up! Who do you think you're fooling, you washed up boxer? A grade-schooler could lie better than you! So, you're determined not to believe me. Are you still trying to pull that crap? Everybody, freeze! - Arrest him! - Right! An ambulance! Call an ambulance! So, Yasunaga beat you on a regular basis, and... ...this time you just snapped and knifed him. Correct? Yes, that's what happened. Why did he hit you all the time? I don't know. He'd just hit me whenever something bothered him. Just tell me the truth. What the hell happened at the Soryu Group offices? He hit me, and I just lost it and stabbed him. Stupid punk. The Soryu Group's really gone to pot... ...letting some punk kid stab one of its leaders in the gang's own offices... ...and not only that, but in front of the boss himself. Times have changed. Shinjo. Don't play games with me. First that punk, and now you. I know you're hiding something! Something stinks here! Of course. If you stay in a shithole like this even one night... ...you'll start to stink. 5 Years Later: Tokyo What do you want? We have your next assignment. Come to the dojo tomorrow. - In position. - Ready. - Okay. Next. That's enough. Junpei Ishimine He's been serving time at North Kanto Penitentiary for attempted murder. He'll be released tomorrow. Your job is to guard him and make sure that he gets to Okinawa... ...then comes back to Tokyo. That's all. You've got one week. The reward for completing the mission successfully is 50 million... ...plus expenses. Sensei, this Ishimine guy is nothing but a failed boxer and a hoodlum. Do you really think he can pay 50 million? He says he's got 500 million yen hidden somewhere in Okinawa. 500 million? I'm sure it's stolen, but that's none of our business. The least we can do is use a part of it to help out Daito Karate, eh? Exactly. North Kanto Penitentiary You're late. I told you the ti... Long time, no see, Junpei. You're looking well. Is it good? The main island sure is cold, Junpei. That was the beginning of the end. Asato and Tengan started a war with us. Everyone was ruined. Everything was completely screwed up. Our gang broke up a year ago. Outwardly, that is. Don't get so excited. All of us have just been waiting for you. Now tell me the truth. Where's the 500 million? A car pulled up while I was waiting at a red light... ...and a man in sunglasses pointed a... Do you understand your position? A car pulled up while I was waiting at a red light. And a man in sunglasses pointed a gun at you. You're always so much fun, Junpei. All right. Shall we start with your feet? Your arms? Or maybe your stomach. He'll shoot. I'll pick out the bullets. We do this until you tell us the truth. You can stop right there. Who the hell are you? Sorry I'm late. This isn't funny, you son of a bitch! If you'd been waiting for me in the first place, they wouldn't have caught me. What if I'd died? This is how I do things. What are you going to do with that? I'm taking it for self defense. I don't care if it is your way, you won't last long like that. - You won't be able to board the plane. - We'll take a boat, then! That's a waste of time. Listen to me. I'm the client, and you're in my employ, and don't you forget it! What? You messed up? What're you talking about? Bodyguard? Kiba from Daito Karate? Idiot! Yeah. Yeah. Soryu Group This is ridiculous. You guys go by plane. I'll think of what to do next. Hey, wait a minute. Tell Kito and Tomoki they're damned morons. Karate, huh? - You're in room number 27. - Thanks. This ship is currently boarding for Naha, Okinawa, and will depart shortly. This ship is currently boarding for Naha, Okinawa, and will depart shortly. Try that! I'll take three. Okay! Who's next? What the hell is this? This is no better than being back in prison. Hey, I didn't tell you to skimp on expenses. Go get us a better room. We won't stand out in this room. They don't think we'd be taking a boat. Go and change the room, now. If you don't follow my orders, I can't guarantee your safety. Fine. The world sure has changed. Now the employee has more power than the employer. I'm hungry. Can I go get something to eat? Wonderful. Hey, are you sure you should eat so much? I've been dreaming about this. I could die happy now. So you won't be needing my protection anymore then. Don't joke about that. See how you feel after eating nothing but gruel for five years. The ocean's great. I feel like my heart's being washed clean. You say the strangest things. Do you have a dream? Why? I was just wondering why you're willing to guard anyone, even a criminal... ...as long as you get the money. You usually have some sort of policy. Only defend the good guys, or something? You're one to talk. You have a point. It's been fun just the way it is. Junpei... Are you all right? I had a bad dream about the past. Dreams aren't always good, are they? Aren't you going to sleep? I am sleeping. Right. Good night. Excuse me, is Mr. Naoto Kiba here? There's a phone call for you. Stay here. Wait a second. I'll go with you. Don't get the wrong idea. It's not that I'm scared. Isn't there a phone on the upper deck? Bastard! Stop! Don't shoot! Stay away! If you really want to go back to prison that much... ...at least wait until after you've paid me. I should thank you. You stopped me from becoming a murderer. You had some nice punches there... for a boxer. Why did you quit boxing? I had a CT scan. I'd gotten knocked out in the ring... ...and the results of the scan showed I had a small aneurysm... ...so I lost my pro license. I was always a troublemaker... ...and fighting was the only way I got recognition. I felt like they'd taken my freedom. But... But? I don't remember asking you to pry into my personal life. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. So what're we going to do? At this rate, they're bound to be waiting for us at port. Don't worry about it. We'll have the police on our side. The police? It'll be reported, the fight. I'll say some Okinawans attacked us, and we defended ourselves. You're my witness. The police will be waiting for us. I've been waiting for you, Ishimine. Damned bastard! The police? This isn't funny! Okinawa Karate turned out to be useless. No, I still have a use for them. Hey, Kito. Call Tamagusuku with Ryukyu News. For now, we'll just watch and see what happens. What're you standing there for? Clean up. Hey. Long time, no see. Do you remember me? Yeah. You've got some guts, coming back to this town. This is my town. It's changed since you've been gone. The Soryu Group has disbanded. That means it's harder for scum like you to make a living now. Both Shinjo and Yasunaga are hard-pressed just to get by. They had some trouble with a Taiwanese prostitute who leaked... ...their drug connections. It must have been a long wait, waiting for you to get out of prison. If it hadn't been for Teacher Daito's intervention... ...you would have been stuck there for a week. Fray on the Ferry. Do you really think you should have said this, Kiba? Okinawa Karate crushed by Daito Karate. Daito Karate is the world's strongest. Okinawa Karate is no match for it. I didn't say anything like this. Maybe someone wrote it for fun. But what will you do? All 250 dojos in Okinawa will be after you for saying this. Don't joke about that. That's not why you came here. What do you want to do tomorrow? Before I go get the money, there's someone I want to look for. Someone you want to look for? That's right. Letter of Challenge Your statements leave us with no choice but to challenge you. Signed, the Okinawan Karate Schools If you want to challenge Daito Karate... ...I, Tetsugen Daito, will take you up on it. Daito Karate never shows its back to the enemy. Tell your masters that. Boss. Daito's here. There could be trouble. Do you know what a man's appeal is? This and... ...this. Kito. Yes? Call her. Yes, sir. Welcome. Is that you, Mr. Okuda? Want a drink? It's me. Ah, that voice. Is that Junpei? When did you get out? Do you know where Yoko is? Hell if I know. She left after you got in trouble, as if she was running away. I see. Hey, Mister, you wanna come in, too? Maybe some other time. A girl, huh? Yeah. Maybe she's not in Okinawa. I told her to go to the main island. But she's the type who can't live anywhere but here. Did you hear from her while you were in prison? Not at all. Maybe she's happily living her life somewhere. Could be. We were no better than bugs, but we survived together. I was an errand boy for the yakuza, and she sold her body. But we had a promise. I have to search for her. A promise? Yeah. Between bugs. Let's hurry and find her. Not bad. It's true Daito Karate is strong. After all, Tetsugen Daito defeated all challengers. But don't think you've beaten Okinawa Karate until you've beaten me. Be careful. The Soryu Group is watching you. He knows. Junpei? Yoko. Junpei. Just like I promised! I searched for you. What have you been doing? About what? From five years ago... Until yesterday... You're the only one... I'll never tell... From now on, we'll be together. We'll stay together... ...as long as we can. Junpei. Junpei... Soryu Group Can I talk to you about something? If you have something to say, then say it. I'm a boxer. I can't get back in the ring anymore... ...but that doesn't mean I've given up. I want to train a champion. I've never told anyone about this before. I felt like if I said anything, it would jinx it. I'm going to use the 500 million yen I stole from the Soryu Group... ...to build a boxing gym in T okyo with new, state-of-the-art equipment. Then I'll find some promising kid... ...and train him to be the champion I couldn't be. So, that's your dream, huh? It doesn't have to be a world champion, or even an East Asia champion. Just a Japan champion would be good. I want to hold a champion belt in my own hands. Funny, isn't it? A dream of a dream. The real me will die without having accomplished anything. A man can't live without dreams. I ought to thank you again. You knew it was dangerous, but still you helped me search for Yoko. I'm glad. That's strange. What is it? I don't see the Soryu Group anywhere. They're probably hiding. They're not the sort to give up easily. Hey, let's go eat. Good morning. Can we have some time alone? What, first thing in the morning? Looks like sex comes before food. Junpei. What? I've been thinking... The Soryu Group is keeping watch on you, right? Why don't you and that Kiba act as decoys... ...while I go and get the money? Don't you think that would work well? Bad idea. You shouldn't underestimate the Soryu Group. Don't worry. I'll do a good job. No way. I'll decide what we do. You never change. You always do exactly what you please. Even then. What do you mean, "then"? Nothing. We make our move tonight. I'll go with you. You wait here. Where on earth did you hide it? I can't believe there's somewhere no one would find it for five years. I'm not stupid. I put a lot of thought into... Don't say anything more. You don't know who might be listening. Not even I do. You're right. Good idea. When you get the money, are you heading straight for Tokyo? Yeah. I don't have anything with me. I need to go back and get my things. I'll go with you. I'd be happy if you would. Do you really live back here? I didn't want anyone to find me. This way. Our boss wants to meet you two. Just come with me. Watch out for her legs! Hello? It's been a long time, Junpei. Boss. I have some merchandise you might be interested in. Help me, Junpei! Please! Yoko! Normally I would have beaten her to death... ...but I'm a human, not a devil... ...so it's up to you how merciful I'll be. What do you mean? This is business. Business? Yeah. You're going to buy the merchandise for 500 million yen. If you don't like it, then it will be disposed of like garbage. What about my Maki? Oh, is this the karate teacher? Thanks for all of your help. Your dojo girl is doing just fine. See how nicely she cries, Teacher? You are going to stay there, though. Someone like you isn't suited for business. If you stay put, I'll give you back your girl. What do you want me to do? Bring the money tomorrow morning at 10. And you'd better come alone, Junpei. If you go back on your word, these two will disappear from the face of the earth. That's all. Keep watch over her at the club. Can't Maki even protect one Ione woman? What should we do? For now, prepare the money. That's easy for you to say. I didn't eat prison food for five years for this! Calm down! They've got us. We have no choice but to do as they One day soon, we'll all be dead. That's why we have fun... ...with our dicks. One day soon, we'll all be dead. That's why we have fun with our dicks... ...with our dicks. ...with our dicks. It's a shame we'll have to kill you. I'm so hard. You're strong willed. That makes me hard. Stop it. Why should I? Let me have my fun. She's an important hostage. Don't touch her. Are you remembering yourself five years ago? I want to talk to her. Go outside. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Junpei loves you and believes in you. He's just deluding himself. Men and women don't always have the same dreams. He said it was so we could escape that life... ...but all it felt like to me was that he was abandoning me. When he escaped to go hide out in prison... ...I was caught almost immediately by the Soryu Group. Where'd he hide the money? Stop! I don't know. Junpei must have told you. I don't know. Where is it? Stop! Where is it, bitch? I don't know. I don't know. There's no way you don't know. I don't know. You stupid bitch. Looks like she really doesn't know. But he's your boyfriend, so you'll have to take responsibility. It's time to have a little fun. Stop. Stop. Leave her there. Poor thing. Look what they did to you. I hate pain. What is a woman's appeal? Mucus and blood, fluid and bile. It's an old Okinawan proverb. I... I want to be happy. I have just one favor to ask. Don't ever look at another man besides me. I did whatever Shinjo asked, no matter how humiliating. That's the only way I could survive. I protected myself, just the way he told me to. You still love Junpei, don't you? What are you talking about? I betrayed him and I'm trying to kill him. - You love him, that's why you hate him. - Shut up. You told me because you wanted someone to... ...understand your motives! - That's not true! I'm already at that point of no return. This is my old gym. Brings back memories... Did you come here for moral support? Don't be silly. I put some in the other sandbag, too. You cut that one open. Soryu Group Hey. When this is all over, please don't kill Junpei. You still can't forget him? That's not it. I want to make him suffer for turning me into this person. A woman's hatred is a frightening thing. So, it's a promise? Yeah. As long as Yoko comes back, that's all that matters. I've just got to think of it that way. Don't worry. I just came to tell you where the girl is being held. What? Club Satine. Thing is, your girl isn't there, though. Why not? She's Shinjo's. You've been had. Don't say that! - I'll go and see if it's true. - Don't be stupid. They said they'd exchange the girls for the money. If you search all of Japan, you'll never find a yakuza that keeps his word. If I don't come back, take the money and run. I can't do that. I'm going with you. Are you coming, too? I'm a cop. I can't just ignore a kidnapping. Leave this to me. There should be a vent we can get in through. A vent? Yeah, on the roof. I'll go see. Five years ago, when I arrested him, it was on an anonymous tip. The truth is, I wanted the 500 million yen, so I waited for him for five years. Why'd you change your mind? I don't know. Maybe I felt sorry for him for being such a sucker... ...but also I wanted to test my strength against you. You're an idiot, too. You might lose your life before you get the chance to fight me. It's the other way around. You'd better not die on me. The vent's clear. - Where is she? - Tell us! I'll take care of these guys. You two go on! Teacher Kiba. Do something! Get him! Ow, ow, ow! Where's Yoko? Where's Yoko? She's... ...in on it. But her heart hasn't been completely corrupted! After you were arrested, Yoko was caught by the Soryu Group. They did horrible things to her. This was the only way she could survive! It doesn't change the fact that she betrayed me. She had to curry favor with the Soryu Group in order to survive. Please! Rescue Yoko. Let's go. And rescue her. They got away. Yasunaga! Junpei, I'm going to kill you. Hey, Kito, where is she? Junpei. Long time, no see. How about it? Want to bet that 500 million on whether she'll shoot or not? I think she will. Shoot. Shoot me. Shoot me. Listen to him. Come on, shoot him. Shoot me. Shoot me! Kill him! Shoot. Thank you. Junpei... Maki will take you to Tokyo. What about you? I have some unfinished business here. I see. You've been very good to me. I'll pay the money as promised as soon as I arrive in Tokyo. A man can't live without dreams. Is that enough to keep going? Who knows...
