I told you to stay home You're not a child anymore What is this? Sir! We have a custom in China for a child to live a long life you must never cut off his plait I didn't ask you Ma Yunlong Come here Why didn't you cut your hair?

You'll never find her. It's useless Mr Ebner! In the 50's we suddenly lost touch Our mother wrote her a letter every year at Christmas but she never even answered It was as if she had just just suddenly disappeared into thin air Why ever try to find her now?

Hi, I'm Susanne Liebl I'm Annie's Granddaughter You do know Annie? Annie? I've come all the way from Vienna just to look for you Hello How, how, How's Annie? She died two weeks ago Oh no I had to promise Annie to go to China and bring this to you I also brought you something from your brother From Roland? He was only 15 when I left Well the man I met was at least! Wait a minute, um ,er He's 77 now They're photographs he took in Vienna Do you remember? Yes, of course I do Oh my God I forgot to offer you some tea the moment you turned around! there was Roland with his camera Did, did Annie, did Annie marry again -No No? She raised my mother all alone She had a hard time Of course It's bitter when you drink it for the first time But you get used to it Thank you, Fanny Is it OK if I call you by your first name? Of course it is You're the first person... to call me Fanny since Yunlong passed away How long ago did he die? A long, long time I'm afraid Too long Do you feel lonely? No We're together all the time I was at sea for more than a month The route took us along the Italian coast We saw the Red Sea ..India... Singapore Hong Kong before we finally docked in Shanghai Yunlong! If the Lord asks me when I die what was the most wonderful moment in your life? I know what my answer will be Come here, Fanny Up here Look Our village is over there It's beautiful It looks just like I imagined Really? U-huh Stop Please Let me out Yunlong, I am all by myself Fanny Please sit down No Please Let me walk with you I will carry you All right? Please And do you know... Yunlong carried me on his shoulders for as long as he lived Fanny We are home Do you like it here? It's lovely Come on Mind the step Who's that young girl? She's our maid Her name is Cui Darling This'll be your room! until we're married Fanny Yunlong Darling Are you tired? No, not at all Do you want some tea? Yes please Fanny Here you are Thank you My mother wants to see me so I have to go Your mother? Yes erm Didn't you say that according to Chinese customs! I'm supposed to call her mother too? Yes Of course So she doesn't know that I'm here? Um, some, some things are! Fanny I'll explain...when I come back All right? All right Thank you No, wait Wait See? No, no I'll do it myself Feet Water I later learnt that my mother-in-law had chosen a child bride for her son in case he couldn't find someone himself But in time she came to accept me and in the end we got along fine For the wedding the following day... Mother had sent for a famous Taoist monk to conduct the ceremony Yunlong tried to explain all their customs to me, but... it was too much at one time Unable to understand the language It felt like I was on a different planet Help yourself Oh darling, not the buns Why You said I could eat Now I can't I'm confused It's another of our Chinese customs I'm afraid The daughter-in-law! Isn't supposed to to eat buns! at the wedding We believe this will cause problems between the mother and the daughter-in-law Why didn't you tell me before? I'm sorry I just forgot Yunlong this is supposed to be our wedding night What are all these people doing here? Sorry, it's another Chinese custom How many more customs have you got? At last, Fanny Now, we're all alone Who would have thought that I would become a real woman surrounded by laughing children Good morning Breakfast's in the kitchen Excuse me but I never asked you if you were married Well, I was But one day he just left |I don't know marriage is a complicated matter Hmm Your grandmother Annie probably would have said you haven't yet found your other half I do have a boyfriend but we're not thinking of marriage We're good friends And? Now I know why Annie sent you here to meet me that's a lovely basket It's for you Really? Yes Fanny U-huh? You've sacrificed your whole life for one man? So? In a few days I have to return to Hangzhou But I thought we'd get married in church first? We will I promise you But my students are waiting for me Wait a minute What do you mean you are going back to Hangzhou? I'm going with you Yes, I know But my mother! Wants you to stay with her No, please, I really can't stay alone with your mother! Our custom is you have to stay! With your mother-in-law No, I'm married to you not to your mother! Listen Fanny There is a war in China The Japanese have surrounded us It's safer in the village Yes but I don't want this kind of safety When you're not with me I don't feel safe anyway Fanny, you just don't understand China Of course I don't understand China I've only just got here! Fanny Oh darling please don't run away Come back Stop! Fanny, wait Listen to me Leave me alone How can you say I don't understand? I've left my parents and friends for you I travelled a whole month to come here to live with you and all you talk about are customs and traditions What's the point of my staying if you're not here? Fanny.. I promise I will never leave you alone please believe me Please I'll never leave you alone, ever That's their tradition A good son should never contradict his mother That's how it is Yes It wasn't easy for my husband to convince his mother... to let me join him in the city So he was a persistent man? Oh yes he arranged a church wedding too Your Grandfather Hua was best man though I was strongly against it at first Because of my grandma? Yes but Yunlong changed my mind Ma Yunlong, do you take this woman Franziska Ebner... to be your lawful wedded wife to love and honor her till death do you part? I do Franziska Ebner do you take... We have to get out of here Come on, let's go I beg you please you must finish the ceremony! But I, we can't... Father, come back... Wait Father... it's not valid yet Franziska Ebner, do you take Ma Yunlong to be your lawful wedded husband to love and to honor till death do you part? Yes, I do Hurry, hurry Exchange the rings Quick! Come on, come on! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost I now pronounce you man and wife I'm sorry Poor Hua was killed by a Japanese bomb In the wreckage Ma Yunlong found the photo your grandfather always kept with him On the back it said: I will always love you, Annie China was heading for terrible times Once the Japanese had been ousted war broke out between Mao Tse-tung's Liberation Army and the Chinese Nationalists The country was hit hard by famine inflation and shortages of every kind I'd had two children and was expecting my third When for the first time in many months I received one of Mother's letters Dear Fanny The War is over Your brother Roland came back with a badly injured leg I also have to tell you that your poor father was killed in the line of duty I feel lonely and I miss you dearest Fanny Yunlong! Yunlong! Yunlong? Fanny Our son looks like you Like an angel Don't sit up look My poor father... Fanny! Don't worry... It'll be alright I promise I'll take you to Vienna! ...to see your family And that's how my husband lost his job He didn't tell me the real reason not until many years later At the time I reproached him for giving up such a good position but he pretended not to hear me His political past with the Chinese Nationalists... would later cause him enormous problems Now, after so much luxury what lay ahead of us... was the simple peasant life The civil war was finally over Mao's Communist revolutionaries had won and happy crowds greeted them wherever they went We too were glad that these awful times were finally over Mama, Papa! I got in Wonderful I'm so pleased Well done! Oh good, that's great, my son Let's celebrate Mama, come and join us I'm coming Xiaolong I've made this specially for you so keep studying hard, all right? Thank you Thank you When have I ever not approved? Stop knitting There's no hurry to finish it I don't have enough wool to finish it anyway Don't worry I will be back soon And I will bring you some wool Please be careful Yes I will It won't be long I'll be back yes Take care Things weren't easy after that I had to take care of everything alone Work, meals, the children even my mother-in-law We had no idea how long my husband would be gone, and... we didn't even know exactly where he was Somehow everything was different even some of the villagers Hm, Doudo... You like the little silkworm? Yes Are you coming out with me? Mama, I need the school fees please You can take two of the white Rabbits But last time we paid with... Mama Grandma doesn't want to eat At least you can eat something Thank you Mama but last time we paid with eggs and this time you want us to pay! with rabbits Everybody will laugh at me Ruihua, we don't have any money Why does Xiaolong have everything! Ruihua, stop it Why is it always my fault? Dear Fanny, Where are you? We haven't heard from you in ages Why don't you write? I think about you every day Your loving mother Dear Fanny Why don't you answer my letters? My daughter is nearly grown up Please write Love, Annie Dear Fanny Please write to your mother if you have any heart She's worried to death about you Your brother, Roland Fanny, my child I keep hoping that my greatest dream will come true and that you will come home I'm so lonely Your loving mother Please God Help me Help me Kand yunlong! and my family and take care of my mother Mama, Papa is home Yunlong Fanny! I didn't forget... I'm still waiting for my sweater What's wrong, darling? What's wrong? It's alright Come here Yunlong don't cry, darling Yunlong I'm sorry Everything will be fine... Shh..shhh Was Yunlong always honest with you? Well he never lied to me He always did his best, he always took care of me We shared everything Happiness is for me a close relationship with the man I loved and still love tied together with this place which is my home You're helping me again If your mother were still alive she'd scold you I never told you... how much my mother admired you After he came back from the reeducation camp we hoped the worst was over We were poor but happy Yes But from 1966 on the political situation in the countryside grew worse ... and became more and more radical The Red Guards even showed up in our village spreading fear and terror everywhere Our family, of course was in twice as much danger: a counter-revolutionary married to a foreigner Yunlong What are you doing? Xiaolong gave us this I have to go away Please take it Do you really have to? They just won't forget me Yunlong! Be strong We've nothing to hide My husband was taken to a camp but no one knew where Being a foreigner I was asked to leave the country I refused So, take care of the baby I have to find your father If I'd left China it would have been like signing Yunlong's death warrant Somehow they were afraid... to kill the husband of a foreigner So in a way I was his life insurance Don't worry All right Yunlong How did you find me? It's Christmas I brought something for you Yunlong How are you? I'm fine I'm really fine Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Fanny It's for you It looks like you No, it looks like you Do you like it? Hmmm Of course I do For 30 years we've celebrated Christmas together On the day they brought Ma Yunlong's body back to the village I received a letter from the Austrian Embassy in Beijing Dear Mr. Ma Yunlong We hereby confirm receipt of your letter According to our records your wife was an Austrian citizen prior to 1938 She is therefore eligible to recover that citizenship... and emigrate to Austria with her children Please bring all necessary documents to the Austrian Embassy You really don't want to go back with me? -No The Chinese have a saying: Falling leaves always fall ...Near their roots But your roots are in Vienna No, I always thought that...er... Kpeople have their roots! Have their roots in one place Well now I know that my roots! Are with Yunlong wherever he is When we... buried Yunlong I had the children dig... a second grave The cowherd and the weavergirl for all eternity Do you mind if I ask you one last thing? Of course not Have you ever regretted your decision? Not for a moment I'm happy I.. Would do exactly the same thing... if I had the choice I would go with Yunlong wherever his path would take me Do you understand? Yes, I guess so Good bye my dear Goodbye Fanny
