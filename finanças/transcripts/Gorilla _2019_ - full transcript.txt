Hand me the small gun Do you think we are the police to shoot as per our wish Robbing the bank is our only motto - Fine - Buddy... Why don't we do a rehearsal before robbing? - Awesome idea - This is too much Remember that movie in which they abduct the vehicle going to the bank and rob it? Similarly, let's rob a van that's carrying money to the ATM Watch out for my performance Show me a sample Once more Listen to me, we don't need him. - Sathish! - Shut up We'll get caught if we try this in city Hence, we'll abduct an ATM van on the outskirts... and rob it! In order to finish this successfully... what we need in the first place is a mask This is a gorilla attack So... This is way too out in the outskirts. Lower the window Sweated I have inquired all the details The van with the money will pass this route to deposit the money in ATM Kong! Any sign of any ATM vehicle? Hey Kong has given us the signal Wear your mask, everyone! - Wear it! Wear it! - Quick! Wear it! - Did you wear it? Oh my God! - Aiyo! Gorilla! He has stopped it. Come on, now! Quick! Step out! Out!

What were you doing? Sorry buddy I expected there would be money but the idea flopped. Forget it Failure is the first step to success Wait and watch, you'll be thrashed Do you want some? Did you guys notice? Since we had gun, no one dared to near us - That too on a broad daylight - There is nobody in there There are two primary issues with our people One being bystanders when there is an issues and another being ignorant towards it That is why people murder in broad daylight and rob any place And people like us are able to plan a bank robbery - You! - What else are we doing? Even though the first planned flopped, it has given me some courage So... the best thing is to rob the bank next We must get in, rob the bank within 20 -30 minutes and escape What? You talk as if we are going to withdraw money from our account How will we get into the bank? Tell us that Then bank we select must be three to five kilometers away from police station Why? Only then when they get the information and by the time they reach it'll take 30 minutes Someone's is going to press the alarm for sure, before we enter the locker room Superb! Then we'll get caught and die! How do we hide and take the guns inside the bank? You don't miss your focus, do you? - This time I'm thinking we'll use Burqa - Burqa? No, burqa will be in black colour and will take in lot of heat Face will get tanned He speaks as though he's been born in Switzerland and brought up in New Zealand - Hey I am an actor dude! - You are mad!

What if he goes in and shoots anybody? Please don't harm anyone - Eight zeros! - What? Eight zeros? 20 million has eight zeros in it This ain't a game, dear And that is why don't take us lightly So stop acting smart and instead go, arrange the money I'm going back in, now - What's wrong with him? - Sir? He bids good bye as if we are here to see him off! They don't seem to be professional thieves How about we break in and gun them down? No! No! No!

Suicide, that is all you know! You think your death will change everything Just like this, when I was working... A farmer died and quit that profession Do farmer's think committing suicide is a fashion statement? My dad died because of debts Which is why I became a fraud like this Die and your children will turn into frauds Can't you take up any other profession if not agriculture? We have many profession to take up What about your food? Farmers are the only generous people in this world! But we aren't allowed to fix a price on the products that we give away You guys think that farmers are protesting and fighting for their own rights But they are fighting for you and everyone in this world Why don't you guys understand this fact? No honest farmer will be as selfish as any of you We fight till our last breath... We are sacrificing our lives to save agriculture! But we unable to do it But... I stepped apart and became selfish And here I'm with you guys, robbing a bank! I am ashamed of myself! Fine. Forget it What is that you want? Can I make a demand? That's it? Just come out and demand whatever you want Instead stop crying like a kid Come on The government will accept all our demands Just demand what you want - Jiiva, listen to me - Jhansi! You don't need this You're committing a blunder Please, you don't need this! I'll knock you down dead! Get lost! How dare you abuse Jhansi in front of me? Do you have any idea who I am? Are you actor Sarath Babu's son? You'll tremble in fear if you find out who my dad is I have been meaning to ask from long back Tell me, who is your father? He is our company MD's son We were here regarding signing up a loan Not just that His father is central minister Ramaiah - So, you have two fathers? - Can't you understand Tamil? - Greetings sir - Minister's son? Now watch how you demand will be met! Darling, come here Sir, please go Jiiva, what are you gonna do? Jhansi, I'll take care Why didn't you mention it before, dear? Like you guys let me speak!

Jiiva, please don't do this! Jiiva! - Can't you hear me? - Jiiva! Remember darling, the remote is in my pocket Act smart, I'll press it and it will be game over! Sir! Greetings! What's up, sir? Look! That's our son! Aiy-aiyo! Please do something! I am really worried Just go to your room! Go! Mic! I need a mic - Come, let's go with our mics - Stop! Step back! Bring that one Mr. Farmer, make sure you demand a huge ransom Just place your mics and come back. Go! Ok sir - Sir, please state all details - Please state all your demands Sir, the guy in the middle looks quite familiar I have seen him frequently around You guys set police on us even after there are 18 hostages' lives in danger You're delaying to pay us up All because none of those lives matter to you That's the respect you have for ordinary people's life You won't question the mystery behind the hundreds of fishermen die in Rameshwaram But two people die inside the Taj hotel and you make it a global headlines Because causalities aren't a big deal to you... the real deal is who are the causalities! So, now we have a hostage whose life will matter to you! Darling, step forward He is... central minister, Ramaiah's son There's the twist in the plot! - Your dad must be watching this - Ok, I'll speak Say 'Hi' to him Dad, they bashed me up inside Didn't you bash me? Sir, he is my colleague. Looks like he has a demand Come on Why is he acting strange? I didn't get a chance to speak Please forgive us all. There is no other option for us other than committing suicide Aiy-aiyo! He has turned on the bomb man - What are you doing? - Getting ready to die! What is your problem? Just say it! Sir We don't need the 200 million that we demanded earlier Move aside Hey Mr. Farmer, what happened? Instead of that, please waive off all the farmers' loan in the state Let the farmers live If you let the farmers die, the very backbone of the country will be shaken I plead you! If you do that, we will surrender ourselves Waive off the farmers' loan Is it possible for the government to do that? It doesn't matter how, but please waive off the loans Do you think it is possible for our government to do that? Please hear me out! Let me speak! Hey! Don't shout! - Sir, shall I take leave! - Save the farmers - Hey, come inside - Please let me go - Hey! - Give me a minute, sir! - List your demands first - Why the soft corner towards farmers? Sir, you better demand some money, this seems unrealistic Cut it out! What is the police doing? A bank is being robbed and my son is held as a hostage too Make sure that he doesn't get hurt Okay, sir Get in! What did I ask you to do and what have you done? I saw it coming! I told you, don't trust this guy. You shouldn't have taken him along - Please forgive me - He is a rebel I thought you would ask for more ransom but you screwed up everything I'm sure we can save all the farmers if you cooperate with me I will meet them again and clarify that money is our demand - Sir, please don't do that - Hey, leave him - Please save the farmers, sir - Hey, take him away from me Please don't give us up. Please save the farmers from dying Please! I am begging you! Save the farmers! Hey hero, that was awesome What's all this? The public seem to enjoy this Hail our heroes! That was an awesome demand! Awesome demand! You guys are the rockstars! You rock! You rock! - Superb! - Awesome! If they had wavered the loans earlier, my father would have been alive today Oh God! Look, what debt has done to you. You left your family to struggle! Told you forget about agriculture and farming. Why didn't pay heed to my words? Dear lord, if they do waiver the loans, it would be very helpful for us You will live long my dear 'Waive off farmer loan ' Look here! This particular demand cannot be met at all The ransom you asked earlier is on its way Take the ransom amount and get away from here I give you two hours Waive off all the farmers' loan Or else the bomb will go off! What did you do to convince him? Waiving them off is not so easy Really? If the government can waive off a whopping 36K billion of the corporate loans In comparison the farmers' loan is only 12K billion Can't waive off that? Each year, the government spends a lot on our army Why can’t we do the same for agriculture too? Both do the job of saving lives Only if agriculture flourishes, the nation will flourish No matter which country it is What are you looking at? The demand should be met Can you translate the same in English? I will give 2 hours time Ban farmers' loan or else bomb blast Sir, can you tell it in Hindi She couldn't understand Tamil, so I spoke in English Now you want me to speak in Hindi too Speaking a language should be a pleasure not forced upon - Got it? - Sorry sir Waive off! Waive off! Waive off! Waive off! Waive off farmers' loan! Waive off farmers' loan! There goes my dream of becoming a hero Is he mad, he has changed the plan - Brother, you rock - That was awesome! Sir, see the support? We call it 'Mass!' I'll skin you alive if I lay my hands on you Robbers who demanded 200 million as ransom... are now demanding the waiving off the farmers loan from the state Robbers who demanded 200 million as ransom... are now demanding the waiving off the farmers loan from the state The incident has shocked the people of the state Do you think the demands of the youngsters could be met? An act of rebel is how I see it Why would you join him and screw it up further? Neither will they give us the money nor will they waive off the farmers' loans If you decide to fight for the people... they will shoot you down and name you a rebel And he wants to do - Will they do it? - Yes they will But I know what's your idea? What? Aren't you planning to try your hand at politics? You will go out and blame the system Am I right? Forget it, every convict will have an opportunity to redeem This is one such occasion Who will blame the system then? Be careful. Don't let anybody burn your hair during the rebel! They'll cut my hair? Hey, they got the minister's son man! Things are going to run smoothly now The boys have rocked Hey, look at this Isn't it nice? This is not their fight, it is ours They have underestimated the youth Divert all the vans to the bank Call our boys, we will join the troop too They are taking things very lightly It is impossible to waive off farmers' loan The government will not abide even if they give their best shot The people are not like earlier. They are quite smart Is this the way to fight? They have held minister's son as hostage. Do you know what you are speaking? They protested in a silent way but their voices fell on deaf ears That's why they took things into their hands! It will never happen, no matter what Idiots! Wait a minute... Why are you talking in their favor? Are you on their side? I was just suggesting sir Suggestion is it? Let me get hold of them Why are you upset? What happened? I would have committed suicide You promised me a life and this was all about it, right? Then why did you say refuse the money? Did you think about my family? Did you think about me at least? I understand both of yours problems (TV News) Look how people are uniting for this cause They should definitely cancel the farmers' loan Farmers loan should be canceled They should cancel the loans of every farmer The government better cancel the farmers' loans Don't you think about the food you eat? Agriculture is the backbone of the country Their fight is right. They should cancel the farmers' loans Please ban We cannot listen to everybody and take decision, the economy will collapse The farmers' loan should definitely be canceled Please cancel the farmers' loans We are nothing without farmers Their welfare is our welfare Remember the protest at Marina? Why do you think it happened? It's all about emotions Money was the ultimatum for me but even I changed If you still think money is important to you Take the bag over there and leave the place Forget it It would be more respectful if I died for the farmers, rather than my family - What do you say? - True Hey, hero You are not the reel hero anymore, you are a real hero Why is he destroying those buttons? What is he looking for? Wait! What are you doing here? Aiy-aiyo! Whoa! Malayalam art? You're here to rob instead look what kind of movie are you watching? Look at those brothers having fun. Stop it! That's the same guy from that movie. Go grab him! Kong, why don't you get better ideas from the Hollywood movies I showed you? Go and grab him instead I said, leave me! Lusty gorilla! Yes, sir! Yes, sir! I will take care sir! The commissioner is sitting calm in his AC room and making my life a hell! He wants me to save the hostages quickly but no one must be hurt And on top of that he wants us to show extra care on that minister's son Hey, who is that distributing water bottles around? Distributing biscuit packets too. Who's that ? Sir, someone named "People's Superstar" it seems "People's superstar?" No one understands the difficulty of police officers These guys are a pain in the head! Even Kamal Haasan... Yeah, I know that he is a great actor. He has also started a party of late He has tweeted 5 long pages of message in support of them We have lost the count of political parties now It would take decades to decode his single tweet and now five pages? How did you finish this level? How did you cross so many levels? What a horrible scene to watch? You wanted to die few days back What's so funny now? At least, I was hoping to die before I came here you on the other hand planned for a luxurious life after this It's so funny that you guys are also going to die along with me Don't you still keep trying to be a hero on the other side after death.

Listen! Excuse me! Long live our future Chief minister! Long live our future chief minister! Back! Step back! - Get down! - Control the crowd! Talking about the bank heist, the people are in full support for the robbers' demands Facebook, Twitter etc., support is pouring is from all over It has now become people's protest. No big shot can do anything about it now So, now that you saw the tweets in twitter... The tweets are also in support to cancel the farmer's loan - I hope at least you understand now - Please, switch it off This channel is making the wrong use of media to prove wrong points More than talking about the youths... what we must focus is on their demands!

Chief, it's would be embarrassing if we budge to some four silly guys Then everyone will start doing the same Silence! You carry on Order us and it'll be done Then bank won't cancel the loan Instead we can announce that the government will pay it Look here... The next election is in three months We won the previous election only when we promised to cancel farmers loans but we didn't All the loans can be paid off if we all stop accepting bribes for the next three months - What do you all say? - Awesome chief!
