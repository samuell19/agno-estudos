(dramatic music) (dramatic music) >> No one took the environment seriously, until it was too late. Food, water and air were poisoned by the years of pollution. Most people died of disease and hunger. The rich people moved underground, where it was safe. Everyone else was left behind. Killers and criminals formed ruthless gangs. When they weren't fighting each other. They were trying to break into the underworld. To steal our food and water. That's where I come in. I work for a TC Unit. Tracker communicator. An elite division of the underworld security forces. Our job was to track the breakers. To kick them out or terminate them. >> Jason, looks like there's trouble with the protective forcefield. >> Shoot this Zoey and let's get the hell out of here. >> Copy. Stand by to record. >> I had a laser decoder a high voltage demobilizer. And a rookie partner named Zoey Kinsella. >> Entrance granted, Unit 22. >> Her father helped form the underworld before he was murdered. I was sure she was going to get my ass clipped, but she was cool. >> Man, is it hot up there or what? >> It's just one big frying pan out there. >> Hey, Henshaw, Dale. >> You're late. >> We're lucky we made it here at all. >> My heart bleeds. Would you rather have the night shift? >> Aw geez, I don't know what do you think, Jason? >> Tough call. Relaxing night off or surface world at night. >> Keep your eyes open guys. >> Hey, it's a jungle out there. >> Exit granted, Unit 99. >> Let's hope it's a quiet night. >> Uh, what I'd give for a cup of coffee and a fresh doughnut about now. >> Look out. >> Yaah! >> Control. Unit 99, we're under attack. Transition Gate 11. Send back up. >> Yaah! (dramatic music) >> Attention! Code 3 Security alert. Repeat! Code 3 Security alert. Breaker attack in progress. All available TC Units, stand by. >> Aw shit. >> Yeah, so much for a relaxing night off, huh. >> Tell me about it. >> Unit 22. Security breach at Transition... (dramatic music) >> Yaah! >> Aah! >> Sparks, this is Storm and Kinsella we're tracking, let's go. >> Yeah, let's do it. >> Confirmed 22, be careful out there. You're outnumbered. (dramatic music) >> Look out behind you. >> Yaah! (dramatic music) >> Yaah! >> Aah! >> Control. ETA Transition Gate one minute. (dramatic music) >> Aah! (dramatic music) >> Fry 'em. >> Aah! >> Aah! >> Entrance denied. >> Go through the gate. >> Jam it. >> Entrance granted, Unit 99. (dramatic music) >> They're getting through at Sub-level 3. They must be getting through at the food storage centres. >> Sparks, Storm and Kinsella here. We're tracking 2 breakers into Quadrant X17. Request???? No back up required, yet. (dramatic music) >> TC Unit 22 this is Control. What is your status, over? >> Control Unit 22 We have requested X17, Y42 unit with slip solo. >> Go that way. >> I'll take the big guy. >> Take care of yourself partner. >> You too. >> Yah! (grunting) >> Yaah! >> Yaah! (grunting) >> Yaah! (grunting) (dramatic music) >> Yaah! (grunting) >> Yaah! >> Yaah! >> Yaah! (grunting) >> Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! >> Yaah! Oh shit. (grunting) >> Yaah! (dramatic music) >> Yaah! (grunting) >> Yaah! Back to surface world for you chump. >> Unit 22, Kinsella has breaker in custody. >> Ditto partner. Now let's get these breakers topside. >> You got it. >> Attention! Return to Security status 6. >> Hi. >> Breakers have been apprehended and contained. (background chatter) Please return to Security status 6. >> Hey Sparks. >> Job's done Sparks. >> Controller wants to see you two. Nice work. (beeping) (beeping) >> Thanks. (beeping) (heavy footsteps) >> Bigelow, Bales out. >> How the hell did the breakers get in? >> They used the dead bodies of Dale and Henshaw. >> Shit! >> Man this shit is ridiculous. >> You know, someone is feeding the breakers our exact schedules. >> I know, it's bad, but I'm looking into it, personally. Meanwhile, we've got to keep our patrols up or the breakers will be all over us. Sparks send him in here. >> He's on his way, sir. >> So what have you found today? >> Well we recorded a variety of topographical locations. And when you match it to Jason's gathering chips, I think you just might find, that Mother Nature's working on a remedy for the lack of ozone. >> I wouldn't be to sure about that. Cameron, I'd like you to meet Zoey Kinsella and Jason Storm. The two best trackers that we have. Cameron Johnson. >> We've met before. >> How could I forget. You spent a year putting word viruses in my computer program. Dr. Cameron was my Cybernetics, Professor at the University. until he left to go to med school at what was it, 14? >> So I suppose, he was captain of the football team? >> Well, we're on the same team now. Cameron is going to analyze the data, that you bring me. To see how it interfaces with our new TC project, on surface world. >> TC2000X's actually. >> 2000X. >> Yeah. Cybernetic trackers. >> Uh-mmh! >> Nice to know you can always be replaced. >> Well, I wouldn't worry about that. We haven't had a lot of volunteers for this project. >> Well if it means moving to surface world you won't find me signing up. >> Oh that surveillance camera at the Communications Centre it just looks like a standard bred camera protect it's force field. >> Thanks Zoey. Sparks, scramble Unit 13. Communication Center. >> A pair of surveillance cameras. >> Aw fuck. >> You little prick. >> I doubt if you can start days Lonnie, >> Yeah, nice assignment. Dale and Henshaw just got fucking smoked coming through that Transition Gate. >> Shit. >> It's been really scary out there. >> Fucking Controller, someone should ship his ass up there. >> Watch what you say Trix. >> Hey, the Controllers, right hand man. >> Hey. >> Back off Bigelow. >> See you in the gym, tracker. >> All right, you two, you know, the rules. Our enemies are the criminals of surface world not each other. When trackers and guards have problems they sort them out here in the gym. Anything goes. >> Come on. (colleagues yelling) >> Jason. Come on Jason. >> Yaah! Yaah! (colleagues yelling) >> Aah! >> Come on Jason, you can do it. >> Aah! (grunting) >> Yeah, yeah. >> Ooh! (colleagues yelling) >> Get him Jason. (colleagues yelling) >> Attention all tracker units and guards. Please report for night shift detail at 19:00 hours. (colleagues yelling) >> Aah! >> Come on. >> Come on, break it up. >> That's enough. >> Come on, be brave. >> Ooh, aah. >> Take it easy. >> Word is you took care of Bigelow. >> Yeah, I taught him a thing or two. He'd be out of commission for a long time. (Kinsella laughing) >> Well I doubt the Controller's going to be to happy about it. >> Yeah, well I'm not to happy with the Controller. He shouldn't hire guards like Bigelow. >> You know, I was just thinking. >> Thinking. Not about the surface world again. Quit playing with that thing it's making me nervous, okay. >> My dad said, "Never to take it off." >> But he never told you what it was for. >> Right. >> So it must not be a key to a buried treasure. >> Maybe. (jazz music) What do you really think is going on up there? >> You know, you like this every time we come back. Can't you relax? >> Look who's talking. >> You keep fooling around with that data crap stuff's going to get you in trouble. >> You have to admit things are starting to grow up there. >> Yeah, for gangs. >> Somebody could be making it easier for them. I think there's a leak in the security system. >> Zoey, leave it alone. Try some of my mussel pasta. >> No thanks. I am going to go and try to figure this out. It's driving me crazy. >> Well the Controller's not stupid. >> I know. >> Be careful, okay. >> I will. Enjoy your dinner. >> Thank you. >> It looks really good. >> I knew she was right. Maybe the Controller was keeping something from us, could this go right to the top. Our Overlord, seemed like a decent leader. But maybe he didn't know anything about this. >> Controller, Master Sumai has been located on surface world, Monitor 7. Should I dispatch a tracking unit. >> No that won't be necessary, Sparks. Sumai poses no immediate threat, but keep me posted, as to his whereabouts. You keep killing yourself off surface scum. Less for me to do later. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) >> Aah! Aah! (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (crowd booing) >> Aaah! >> Welcome! Friends. To my humble home. We have much to celebrate. Blade. Let's hear some music. (record spinning on turntable) That's nice, that's nice. Picasso, the time has come for surface world to reclaim what's rightfully ours. And defeat the underworld forces. We may now penetrate their underground sanctuaries, with this a trackers PDR. A gift from the enemy. (crowd cheering) So let's party boys. (crowd cheering) >> Long live the Picasso. >> TC Unit 13, this is Control. What is your status, over? >> Control, Flannigan and Zimicks here we've reached the Communications Centre. The protected force field surveillance camera Section 6 & 7 tied. The tech's working on restoring power now. >> What is your ETR Unit 13, over? >> Estimated completion of repairs at 24:00 hours, over. >> Ah, Zircon a shame to waste a bottle of this great stuff it would make for a fine evening. Sometimes I guess, we have to make sacrifices, don't we. Death to the under world. >> Aah! Aah! >> We're under attack. >> We're under attack. We need back up. One man's down. We're need a MedEvac immediately. (dramatic music) >> Help! Help me. Somebody help me. >> Yah! (dramatic music) >> Kiai! (grunting) >> Kiai! (dramatic music) Bring the bodies to the Transition gate. And be quick. >> Come on, let's go. (dramatic music) >> You're mine tracker. >> Entrance granted. (explosion) >> Aah! >> Entrance denied. >> Come on, bring the bodies before they freeze the gates. Hurry up, Blade (warning signal beeping) (computer keys clacking) >> Security breach Transition Gate 12. (warning signal beeping) >> Scramble Tracker Unit 7,10,22. >> 7,10 and 22. What does the monitor say? >> Well, Niki Picasso. >> Hello! (tracker PDR beeping) (tracker PDR beeping) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Come on. our mission awaits us. >> All right. Let's get these guys. (dramatic music) >> Okay, Unit 2, take tunnel 105 remember I'm behind you. >> Good. Camera 45 Y14 and they definitely know their way around. >> Okay Unit 17 high side Tunnel 104, right flank. >> They're not headed for the reservoir, where are they going? (warning signal beeping) >> Calling for back up. (background chatter) (grunting) (clapping) >> Let's ask these gentlemen to cool off the hijackers and give us a hand. >> Attention! Code 1 Security alert. >> They've breached the tunnel access code they're into Quadrant 13. >> Alert the trackers. >> Attention TC Units 7 and 22 this is Control. Breakers have entered into the main frame quadrant they're into Quadrant 13. >> God, they must have got Unit 10. >> It's the only way, they could have gotten in, damn. (panel beeping) (dramatic music) Control, they're heading to the reservoir. Correction, they've turned north Quadrant 36. >> They've got a plan. >> What the hell this is a dead end. >> Wait! What are they doing? (dramatic music) (glass panel shattering) >> What is it? >> Entry by unauthorized personnel is... >> Control this is Storm and Kinsella. >> ...forbidden, repeat. we just chased the breakers into what appears to be a dead end. >> What the hell is going on, Sparks? >> My apologies 22, we're working on it. >> Additional trackers units have been dispatched. Please stand by. (panel beeping) >> There we are. (panel beeping) Follow me! >> What are your precise coordinates 22? >> Okay Control. We're at East 47, North 52. >> North 52, nobody's been there for years. They're right under us. Where's the Controller? >> Anything I can help you with? >> No! Proceed with caution. >> No kidding, come on. >> Attention! This quadrant is restricted. Entry by unauthorized personnel is not permitted. >> Something's wrong Zoey. Why in the hell would a breaker risk his life to enter a dead zone? >> Doesn't make any sense. This place doesn't even show up on our maps. How do they know that and yet we don't? (grunting) >> Trackers, looks like... it's time to die. >> It's time to get a new watch. (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) >> Aah! >> Aah! >> Yaah! Yaah! (yelling) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) >> Ah, what a beauty he didn't let me down. (laughing cynically) Surprise! (gun firing) >> Aah! >> Shit! >> Come on Zoey, let's go. >> Get that gun, let's get outta here. >> I've got this. (gun firing) >> Unit 22, this is Control, do you read? >> Control this is Storm and Kinsella we're under fire, send some back up. (gun firing) >> Control, he's shooting at us, send back up. (gun firing) Repeat, send back up. (alarm beeping) Control, come in. (alarm beeping) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) We're trapped. I have an idea. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (gun firing) >> Noooo! >> Aah! (somber music) >> Zoey. >> It's okay. They're bullets. >> Zoey, Zoey hold on. Don't talk, save your strength. >> You lied to me Jason, you said, we'd be partners forever. >> Zoey, we are partners, partners forever. Zoey. Zoey. Zoey. Noo! >> Why do you want her at Terminal sStation anyway? >> Never mind that, just answer my question. Can we program her to do whatever I want? >> Certainly, if you want her to take on the Lifers at the turning station, she'll do it. No questions asked. She may require some assistance but I can program her to be very resourceful. >> And they have to be dead? >> Clinically, for the radical neuro-restructuring. >> Well do you erase her memory? >> To dangerous. No one will figure out how to access the memory. >> No one! (Cameron snickering) Well it's not exactly what the Overlord had in mind, but what the hell. Now let's see about getting her partner back. (dramatic music) >> Remember, you're my woman and I tell you what to do. >> Let her go. Get out of the way kid. And when I say it, you'll do a dance. Come on. (woman screaming) You'll do as I say, or I'll be... (dramatic music) You there, interfere in my work and I'll tear your head off. (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) >> Aah! (giant yelling) Come here you. (grunting) >> Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! >> Yaah! Bah! Bah! (groaning) >> Aah! >> Yeeah! Yeeah! Yeeah! (laughing) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) >> Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! >> Aah! (dramatic music) (boy screaming) >> Get outta here. Just you and me. >> Yaah! >> Come on little man, I'll show you who's big and tough but it sure ain't you. Come on get me, come on and play my game. >> Aah! (wall shattering) >> Enhance 3 times. A PDR, that's strictly TC issued. Shit! They have an access code. They had help from the inside. Zoey, you were right. They sold us out. >> The soul is that we can commit to the elements the body of our sister Zoey Kinsella dear departed. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust but in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life. >> Sorry Jason. >> We'll miss her. >> My condolences. >> Her father and I worked on a lot of projects together before we moved underground. It seems like Zoey's always been a part of my life. If there's anything I can do Jason? >> I would like to see her one more time if I can. >> That's out of my hands. Her body's the property of the security council now. >> That property used to be my partner for 10 years. >> Her chips, her access codes they've all got to be removed. Like all trackers she is now listed as classified information. Well, that's fucked. Breakers have access to classified info and we don't. >> What? >> Zoey recorded our last run the breakers had a PDR with an access code on it. >> Does anybody else know about this? >> No. But I'm not sticking around to see someone else, get greased. >> You want to quit? You want out? Fine. Report for total deprogramming. Right now. (dramatic music) >> If you know what's good for you, get the hell out of here. Prepare to remove his homing system, directions finder and access chips. Cardiac monitor? >> I'm running a cardiac doctor but it can't be perceived. ECG normal. >> Blood pressure? >> 130 over 70. >> Set up for an art line. >> Right away. (coughing) (coughing) >> So many died. >> What the hell, Jason Storm is still alive? Why didn't you take care of him in the deprogramming room like I told you? >> There was too many people around. Besides, I can ruin my career. Screw your career. You work for me now. Bigelow, you get your boys on him and don't you screw up. (knocking on door) >> Storm, Storm we've got you now. Storm, Storm open up. (banging on door) (door bursting open) >> Yaah! (glass shattering) Yaah! Yaah! >> Aww! >> Yaah! >> Yaah! >> There he is. >> Oh shit! >> Hey shit! Damn man! We're dead meat. >> No, he's dead meat. (grunting) >> Attention! Fugitive at large in Sector 4. Apprehend immediately. Authorize and identify all unsanctioned personnel. (dramatic music) >> Trackers, Jason Storm has defected to the surface world. This poses a significant security risk. And I have further information that confirms Jason orchestrated the break in that resulted in Zoey Kinsella's death. >> Nah, he wouldn't do that. >> Jason Storm is a traitor and must be apprehended. (dramatic music) >> Do you want to see the sights? You've got to pay the price. Give me your bag, pretty boy. And I'll let you live. (laughing) >> Back off, rat face. I've had a hard day. (dramatic music) >> Yah! >> Yaah! (grunting) Yaah! Yaah! (dramatic music) >> Get up! >> Yaah! >> Come on. >> Awwh! >> Freeze him. (dramatic music) (screaming) (menacing growl) (whimpering) (heavy footsteps) >> Members of the press, we've always been committed to the safety of those who live here in underworld. We are increasingly concerned by the unrest and lawlessness coming from above. We are under attack. And we must fight back. I present to you a scientific marvel which will ensure your protection for the coming century. 80 percent human 20 percent machine and 100 percent dedicated to its mission. Ladies and gentlemen I give to you the TC2000X. (clapping) >> Grand master. (speaking in foreign language) (fighting sequence) (clapping and cheering) >> Hey, look over here. (clapping and cheering) Are there anymore of you where you come from? >> Over here. >> Get a close up shot. >> Can you come this way please. >> Hey TC, who's the next model? >> 2000, what 20 percent of you is not human? (cameras clicking) >> Zoey, I have to kill you. (gun firing) >> Cybernetic Trackers. Controller you're making a mistake. (murmuring) You're the key Zoey. (drums beating) (people yelling) (exotic music) >> Hey big boy. Looking for a good time? (exotic music) (background chatter) >> The time for betting is over the time for fighting is now. >> Yeah! >> Our challenger tonight has the speed of the jaguar the strength of the rhino sting of the scorpion. He's Zap! (cheering) He's known throughout the territory for his skills and cunning, he's a survivour. Master of all who come before him the reigning champion Sumai! (cheering) (dramatic music) It will be the greatest prize we have to offer. The two that have entered here only one may leave. Kari. (cheering) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) (fighting sequence) >> Yeah! Yeah! (fighting sequence) >> Look out Sumai he's got a knife. (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) >> Yaah! (gong clanging) >> Come on, let's move. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (people yelling) >> Miller, Basil, what a surprise. >> Yeah for you, let's get this traitor out of here. >> Bah! (dramatic music) (grunting) >> Forget about Sumai, get me the girl. >> Yaah! >> I'll take care of this bitch. Yaah! >> Yaah! >> Ooh! Yaah! >> Yaah! Yaah! >> Aah! (fighting sequence) >> Yaah! >> Aah! >> Stop! Join us? >> I thought you'd never ask. (grunting) (mellow music) >> You have earned my father's respect tracker that is very rare. >> Name is Jason. He helps me, I help him. Far as I'm concerned, we're even. He wishes to thank you anyway. >> How did you end up with that? That belongs to you, you know, you would have won the fight. But I accept something a little more precious than water. And that's information. I'm looking for a guy with a painting on his face. >> Niki Picasso. >> That sounds like the man that fits his face. >> There are very few who do not know of Niki Picasso. >> What of Niki? >> He killed my partner and that's why I'm here. >> He has terrorized us for years. >> Why hasn't someone stopped him? Sumai, you're a great warrior, why haven't you taken him on? >> I am one man. >> Niki's stand is many. >> Well then, let's go play his game. Let's go round up some good fighters and go kick his ass. >> Only the Lifers will stand up to Niki Picasso. >> Let's go get the Lifers and pay Niki a visit. >> The Lifers are a brotherhood of vicious criminals. A closed society. They protect, Terminal Station. >> Terminal Station. >> Terminal Station is a chemical warfare plant. The population of the surface world was to be eliminated when the ozone layer repaired itself. >> That's insane. >> So far, it has been impenetrable. There is some fear that someone discovered the key and activated it. >> Picasso? >> Niki Picasso's very clever but. >> Niki Picasso's going down with you or without you. >> Go by, day. >> It's the only way to get close to Niki's fortress. He thinks no one is stupid enough to go by day. >> No one ever accused me of being bright. >> Now why should I trust you? You've been sent by the Controller. >> I've been programmed to rescue surface world at any cost. And you will help us. You have a great army of warriors You and the Picasso's are the only fighters that can defeat the protectors of Terminal Station. >> It's simple. You get me safely to the Terminal Station's door and the Controller will get you whatever you want. >> The last time I worked with the Controller I almost got my ass shot. >> Well this one, I will personally guarantee it. (wind blowing) >> Sumai? >> You're crazy to go alone. >> Crazy to go together. >> But much less crazy. In day, the Picasso sleep. >> Let's make our way to the tower. (wind blowing) >> Niki Picasso down there, very difficult. >> No problem. Tracker School 101. So we have two choices Sumai, either I lower you or you lower me. >> Don't forget to write. >> Wise choice. (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (heavy footsteps) (ball bouncing) (thump on table) >> Where is it? I know it's here, somewhere. (dramatic music) >> Yeah! (spinning record on turn table) Can you hear it honey? (grunting) (grunting) >> Aah! >> Go back. I've waited a long time for this moment you killed my partner. >> Killed who? Oh no! >> Don't screw with me, you sack of shit. >> Hey, hey don't kill the messenger of good news. (grunting) She's still alive. >> Bullshit! How do you know? >> I know much more than you think. Where do you think I got this? Does this look familiar to you? Okay, okay you want to see her? Honey, you got a visitor in here. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (heavy footsteps) (dramatic music) >> Zoey! >> Easy boy. She's a wild woman. >> Partner! >> Yaah! (grunting) Yaah! (grunting) Yaah! (dramatic music) Yaah! >> Zoey, please. >> Yaah! Yaah! >> Zoey, stop it. >> Yaah! (grunting) Yaah! Hey! (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) >> Zoey, stop it! (Picasso laughing) >> Yaah! (dramatic music) Yaah! >> Come on Zoey. >> Yaah! (dramatic music) >> Zoey, stop it! (computer static) >> Zoey, no I can't fight you. >> What? (computer static) (gun firing) (computer static) (gun firing) What? (computer override) (laughing) Yaah! (grunting) (computer override) Yaah! (dramatic music) Yaah! (grunting) >> Bye, bye Jason. >> Yaah! (dramatic music) >> What the hell happened Sumai? >> TC2000X. >> You've been unconscious for a day now. Much has happened. What is the benefit of this android? >> She's no android. Her name is Zoey. She used to be my partner. >> The Lifers have encountered her. >> Lifers, oh man. If Niki gets her to the Terminal Station do you know what that means? The end of surface world. We got to get going. >> Rest! (dramatic music) >> We'll make our move soon. Lifers must be surprised that they can be defeated. >> Nobody has ever defeated the Lifers. >> But we will Niki, we'll kill them all. Enter Terminal Station and all of surface world will be ours. >> Gentlemen! >> All power will be yours. >> What the hell is going on? Why isn't she leading him back to the Terminal Station? >> She's merely fulfilling my program. Love takes time. >> Did I ask you for an android on hormone overdrive. Your counter-programming could jeopardize this whole operation. >> She's gotten this far hasn't she. >> This far, is not good enough. Now you, get her back on track. Before the Overlord finds out that she's even up there, all right. (dramatic music) (drums beating) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) >> Is it true the energy transfers power through the objects? Will you teach me? >> Yes! (dramatic music) (Sumai yelling) (watermelon smashing) >> Sumai I can't remember the last time I felt so great. Feel like I'm part of a team now. I mean I'd be still with Kinsella but... >> Kinsella! >> Kinsella! >> Zoey Kinsella, what's up? >> A man named Bertram Kinsella built Terminal Station. to replenish the atmosphere. Instead, it became the ultimate weapon of death. >> Zoey's father. >> My father often told me of a young girl who was the sunshine of this brilliant man's life. Before he was murdered. >> Zoey's father, Terminal Station. How do you actually open up the gate Sumai? >> This is still a mystery. >> It died with Bertram Kinsella. >> I don't think so. Zoey's father once gave her necklace. >> What did it look like? >> It was a child's hand outstretched holding a... >> A Key. >> Bingo! >> There it is Niki, Terminal Station. >> It's not going to be easy. >> Nothing worth waiting for should be easy. >> You're learning to play hardball aren't you? >> And so do I. Ooh! >> I got this one Niki. Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! >> Aah! >> We'll need all the Picassos for this one. (dog barking) >> For crying out loud, where is she going? Why don't you stay focused? >> All is working out, I trust. >> Fine. Fine. Couldn't be better. >> Good. Good, that's what I like to hear. The TC2000X, everything's working out? >> Like a charm. Everything is going completely according to plan. >> Yes, I can see that. Let's hope it stays that way. (dramatic music) (training sequence) (training sequence) >> I think we're ready. >> To soon. >> To soon. Whether it's controlling Niki or sealing up the Terminal Station. I'm not going to sit around here watching. Why don't you guys join forces? And try to squash this little parasite. >> There's a limit to hospitality, and you're coming dangerously close. >> Sumai. What are you going to do? >> Enough! >> Sorry, I was pushy, but your people need a leader. And I think it's your father's time. >> You want all the answers? The station my father knows, the inside and out. When they asked him to come here, it was to train guards to protect military secrets not guards for instruments of death. >> They lied to your father, it wasn't his fault. (heavy footsteps) (heavy footsteps) (machinery humming) >> What the hell are you doing out of the control room? >> I had to take a dump for crying out loud. >> Well, you're the genius. Figure out some way to do that while you watch that monitor. I'm not done with you yet. If this thing screws up you'll go down with me. Do you have a problem with that? >> Yeah, I do. I created the perfect protector not the perfect killer. >> It's the same thing, other side of the coin, kid. Anyway, I didn't see you complaining when you had Zoey Kinsella's body to fondle in this project. >> I suppose you figure no one would notice one more boy, that wasn't perfect. You orchestrated it all from the control room. And that bad team rushed in and all of a sudden she was on my table. And you knew. You knew no one would ever realize what had really killed her? >> And what's that? A bullet from a handgun, hmm. A handgun, like this. Wrong kid. Guns don't kill people, people kill people. (gun firing) (dramatic music) Well, well, well. You were closer to the truth than you thought lover boy. >> Lifers, guard Terminal entrance here. And we going to hide over here. >> First, we need more fighters. The Lifers are very tough. >> Sumai, you're okay. (dramatic music) Listen, you people need to get with the program. Sumai said it all. The time to act is now. >> We trust Sumai, but Niki's a killer. >> The old guy struts his stuff and you're all ready to drop to your knees. Well go ahead and let this little fossil get you all killed. If you're looking for a leader, I'm right here. This guy's a joke. (crowd murmuring) >> My time to lead. (dramatic music) (fighting sequence) (dramatic music) >> Who will join us to fight Niki Picasso? (dramatic music) >> I vouch for these two. (training sequence) (training sequence) (training sequence) >> We've just gotten word from Niki. >> That's good Bigelow, our plans are unfolding nicely. So, we have a lot to do. >> An extended coffee break, I presume. There's a little something I want to discuss with you. It concerns my TC2000X. >> Well, sir your TC2000X, is just fine. >> Really? The TC2000X was conceived to protect the people in my quadrant, that was her sole purpose. I want you and your boys to catch the next bus to surface world and I want my investment back here, now. (laughing) >> Bigelow. >> You wouldn't not here, not now in front of everybody. (groaning loudly) >> Bigelow, I think you're going to like living on surface world.

(dramatic music) (can clinking) Okay! I got you your Citadel. >> You've done a soldier's job Niki. And you'll get everything I promised. Guns, ammunition and real food. (people cheering) >> And then what? >> See then you will live like Kings and Queens here on the surface world. You stay here, we'll be right back. >> Heh, No. I'm going up too. I'm not letting you out of my sight. The key to her father's house. And the key to my future. Now it's time for daddy's little girl to get down on her knees isn't it? Because daddy's little girl was much smaller when he made this lock. Would you? (beeping) >> Positive identification. >> It is time. (machines whirring loudly) (door opening) (people cheering) Let's go! >> Okay! >> Attention Christmas shoppers. The store is now closing. >> Let's go! (dramatic music) >> You know, your father was a brilliant man Zoey. Unfortunately, he was also a fool. He thought he could save the surface world. He died before the full power of Terminal Station was realized. (machines whirring) (footsteps running) >> Come on, let's go. (heavy footsteps) >> The Kill Zone is only accessible from the top floor. So we'll cut through the cook house here under the stairs. (men yelling) >> Be careful.

Jason. >> Atmosphere glares are in place...catalyst #2. >> What the hell's going on? >> Cameron put a virus in your program to shut you down. >> What? >> Never mind!
