- Make sure that the reindeer stay away from it, all right? - Thanks. - Sir. Didn't you get my page? - I'm sorry, what? - My page. - Oh, look. I had it on silent. - Sir, the time has come for you to select your Santa substitute. - Again? Why? - Well, it's been 36 years. I mean, the Christmas magic is beginning to spiral beyond our ability to contain it. The results could be unpredictable, chaotic. It's up to you to reset it. - Mm. - You have to entrust Christmas to someone who's in danger of losing their Christmas spirit. - You're right, you're right, Eddie. All right, so then how do we select a candidate these days? - Rob. Thanks very much. As we stand here today, there are 230 million candidates. Their names are gonna come scrolling along this tablet screen. When you're ready, you're gonna push "enter," and your candidate's name will be highlighted. "Enter" when you're ready. - Uh, bap. Ha-ha. - Oh. Daniel Ryebeck. He lives at... - I know where he lives, Edward. I know where they all live. - Uh, sir. Two other things. You're not allowed to perform any Christmas work while your substitute has the title. Officially you're not Santa Claus during that time. - Well, can I visit? - Well, you're certainly allowed on the premises. The other thing is Mr. Ryebeck... He must consent of his own free will to do the job. - It's never a problem with me, Eddie. You know, I have my ways. - You certainly do, sir. I'll begin assessing your initial candidate. Danny ryebeck. I remember you well. - Your mom made that by hand. - With a little help from Santa. - Thanks, mom. - And now that one is from your father. - Hope you like it, son. - Thanks, dad. - Dan... I'm sorry we couldn't afford many presents this year. But you'll see when you're a father. Can't put a price on love. - And here's something for you. - We love you, son. Okay, there's gotta be a job in here somewhere. Bam. Thanks. - I know you. - You're the guy who sold me my tickets to Hawaii last year. That was you, huh? - Yeah, it folded two months ago. Hey, buddy. - Next. - Yeah, I'll be by to pick up you and your sister real soon. By the way, what was the name of that game you were talking about? - Next. Thank you. - Squire of Wessex. Got it. And they close when? Okay. I'll be by soon. Bye. Oh, um, wow. I-I have to go. I'm gonna call to follow up. I'll call. - We'll call you. - Pardon me. - Merry Christmas, sir. May I help you with something? - Yes, I'm looking for the squire of Wessex video game. - It's right here to the right. - All right. - Okay. - And I think my daughter might like the purple guitar. - That's a great beginner's guitar. Ideal for the beginning student. - Really? That'd be great. Oh, ouch. - She would love it. They don't make a finer-looking instrument, sir. - Or apparently a more expensive one. I will just get the game. - Okay. That's 17.89. - All right. - I'm sorry, sir. Your card has been declined. Is there another you can try? - Oh, uh... Huh. I'll just pay cash. Okay. Here you go, sir. Merry Christmas. - Yes. Merry Christmas. - Hey, lady, if you're really hungry, there's a soup kitchen down the street. Otherwise the hot dogs are $2. - 'Scuse me. I'll buy the young lady a hot dog. - Oh. - All right. - Thank you. - Thanks. - You want onions? - Yes, please. - All right, thank you, Debbie. - They said I might find you here. - Ah. Well? - Well, he's not the worst candidate ever. Yeah, no. That'd be Ezra Spindleshanks, 1846. That man taxed my Patience. - No, Mr. Ryebeck is not that person, but I wonder what skills he'll bring to the workshop. - You know, you always say that, Eddie. - Nor am I convinced how he'll react when we turn the magic over to him. - He's gonna make mistakes, and then he's gonna figure out how not to. - Magic is unpredictable even when you use it. I mean, chaos theory started to explain that. But now I guess computer search algorithms are a better parallel. - It's the human heart that makes it go, Eddie. Nothing else. But I know this. If you expect nothing from people then that's what you're gonna get. But if you expect much from them you're gonna get that too. Come on. Have a little faith, Eddie. You might just be surprised by Dan ryebeck. - Yes, sir. Now with that, I think I need to meet our Mr. Ryebeck. And let him know that he's this year's Santa Claus. Oh, boy. This is gonna be great. - Santa. - Yeah? - Make sure you obtain Mr. Ryebeck's consent. - No problem. Hey, gang. I'm here. - Hey, dad. Come in. - Come on in here. You're not too big to give me a hug. - I've got a joke for you, dad. How come Santa goes down chimneys? - I don't know. - Because it "soots" him. You get it? Soot? - Ah, I like it. Right here. Got you a little surprise. It's the squire of Wessex. - Oh, but this is the old one. The one I already have. - Sorry about that, buddy. - It's okay. The new one's hard to find. Did you want to play? - I do, but let me just check this. All right. Great. I got the job? Hey, sweetheart. - Oh, hi, Dan. How are things? - Never better. - Would you help me outside, replace a few bulbs on the front porch? - Sure. So many Christmases. Takes you back, doesn't it? It sure does. - Yeah, those were some carefree times. - It was. I spoke with the attorney. And he wanted to know if you can come in and look over those papers on Friday. - Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Wow. - We've been separated for a year. Let's not prolong things. And like we talked about, let's not break it to the kids till after Christmas. Yeah, okay. - Sorry for tooting the horn, but I have brilliant news. - What's that? You're retiring the word "tooting"? - Linda, we are going to represent the new 220 luxury unit downtown complex and it's all because the owners loved your marketing plan! Oh! - Fantastic. - I always thought British guys were supposed to be pale with bad teeth. - I guess the London Olympics rubbed off. Almost made the UK diving team. You should see me in my speedo. - Take a pass on that. - I just dropped by to give you the good news. - Thanks, but I think everyone on team Trevor deserves credit. - Okay, well, thanks for stopping by, there, team Trevor. It's been real. - Right, cheers. Linda, I'll see you at the office. Got a lot of work to do this week. Oh, almost forgot. Saw a few things I thought your kids might like. I assume they're into video games. I understand these wireless controllers are state of the art. - Oh, Trevor, you shouldn't have. - No, really, you shouldn't have. - The kids are crazy for video games. - Well, no, I really wouldn't say "crazy for them." I mean, they'll deal with them, I guess. - Mom, can Joe and I go next door to see the Hendersons' tree? - Oh, sure. But Mr. Winthrop brought you these gifts. - Thanks, Mr. Winthrop. - Call me Trevor. Trevs. - Yeah, okay. Thanks. Come on. - Ah, the wonders of youth. Well, I guess I'd better be toddling off. Linda, I'll see you at the office. Cheerio, Dan. - Cheerio, trevs. Try not to crash that pretty little car of yours. - Ha! - Next time I'd appreciate it if you don't get into a chest thumping contest with my boss. - He's lucky I didn't take it to the next level. - See you later, Dan. And remember, seven days till we sign those papers. - All right. Seven days. Seven days. Seven days to get you to change your mind. - Ho, ho! Santa is here! Okay, who's next to see Santa? - Me. - Oh, come on, now. Oh, ho. And what is your name, little fella? - Allan. - And Allan, have you been a good little boy? - Your jacket's not buttoned up right. - I have been in the sleigh for many hours, and I haven't had a chance to check my mirror. So what would you like for Christmas? - I think we both know that you're not the real Santa. - Let's...let's... Let's stay on target here. - Hey, you're the guy that lives near me in that apartment off main. - Nope. Nope. - You're the guy that always listens to violin music and cries at night. - That's it, okay? - Santa. - Oh, ho! 'Scuse us. Someone needs a refresher course in Santa 101. Firstly, Santa is jolly and answers all adversity with a "ho, ho, ho." - But that little kid... - Number two... Santa sticks to the script. - Right. - Dad? - Uh... Hey, Sally. - Come on, let's go. Just go. - Sally, wait. My daughter. - Sally! - Turn in your beard. Great. - ♪ ...third day of Christmas my true love sent to me ♪ ♪ three French hens, two turtledoves ♪ ♪ and a partridge in a pear tree ♪ ♪ on the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me ♪ - What? - ♪ Four calling birds, three French hens... ♪ - Expired tags? I don't have expired tags. Expired tags! When did that happen? August. No. No, no, no, no, no! Oh, come on! So I had some unpaid tickets. Come on, guys. I was gonna pay them. - Hey. What will it be? - Give me something strong enough to forget about Christmas. - A hot toddy should do the trick. I'm gonna go heat up some water. I'll be back in a few minutes. - Forget about Christmas? Why ever would somebody want to do that? - Huh? - Why would anybody ever want to forget about the happiest day of the year? - Well, maybe because Christmas is one big letdown. Nonsense. - It's the holidays, right? So let's just agree to disagree and I'll buy you one of whatever you're having, okay? - Well, hot chocolate with mint and a dash of yuletide. - Right. - Look, Christmas isn't always perfect on the surface. But disappointing? Never. - Hey, don't you have a Christmas wish? - Yeah. Get my family back. - Well, anything's possible at Christmas, Dan. - How'd you know my name? - Uh, you said it, didn't you? - Oh. Yeah, I guess I did. - You know, it seems to me that you have issues with Christmas. Yeah, well, that's an understatement. I do have issues with Christmas. I got issues with not being able to give my kids what I want to. Never being able to deliver enough. I got issues with my booted car, the fact that I just got fired and that my marriage is on the rocks. So yeah, I got a few problems with the whole, "happy holidays, Santa saves the day" deal. - So maybe you think you could do a better job of it? - You bet I could. I'll see you around, pops. You enjoy Christmas any way you want. As far as I'm concerned, January can't come soon enough. See you around. - Taxi. Interesting decor. - 550 main street. - Well. Fancy seeing you again. - You're faster than you look. - You complained about Christmas all night. And you said you could do it better than St. Nick himself. Well, I'm St. Nick. - Oh, you're... Okay. All right. Boy, I sure could use a vacation. - Let me out. - Done. And fare's on me. - Thank goodness. Whoa. - That...that's my building. - Yeah. - I didn't even feel the car move. - Good night. - And good night to you. - And thanks. I really appreciate you helping me. Santa. Any time. - I'm outta here. - Where you going? - Vacation. The missus wanted to go someplace warm, sunny. Don't tell anybody, but we went with Bimini. - Well, what about Dan? What about Christmas? - Well, you told me I couldn't work so I'm not. This year it's your show. And of course Dan's. - But what if he misuses the Santa car? - Oh, he will. - What if he focuses on his own problems and completely ignores Christmas? - Well, that's practically guaranteed. - Well, how am I supposed to manage that? - The same way you manage everything, Eddie. Come on, you've always done the real work. As long as I can remember. - Yes, sir. - Well, the missus and I have gotta catch a plane. Well, merry Christmas, Eddie. And don't call me. - Yes. Yes, happy holidays, parking enforcement. Who do I talk to about getting a boot off my car? - I really hope I get those alpine skis. - 'Scuse me? - I want a motorized starship with a blaster. - I'd love a 16 gigabyte smartphone. - You know what, I'll call back. Thank you. I'm sorry, I was on the phone. Were you talking to me... No, you were not. - I hope he gets me the ring. - That's the model I want. - I want those boots. I really, really want them. - Um, you want those boots? I think you should get those boots. I think they'd look very good on you. - Hey, buddy. What's the big idea? You hitting on my girl? - No, not at all. I thought she was talking. - Yeah, get outta here. - I don't remember where I parked the car. No, I don't know. - No, I'm not... Yes, you are hearing things. No, you are not. - Look at that guy talking to himself over there. - This is stress. - Is that... - Dad? - Hey, kids, let's buy some DVDs. - Okay. - I really want that bike. I really want it. - Gift certificate I can get those... - I'm gonna ask Santa for it. - Train I had when I was a boy. - Ask for the bonus so I can... - I gotta get outta here. - ...Tree topper. - ...have a pink one of these. - You okay, sir? - Yeah. Migraine. I'd like to exchange this game for the new one. - Okay. - And, um, here's the receipt. - Okay. Welcome back. Okay, with the return on the old one, that's an additional 34.95. - Really? 34.95 more? - Yes, sir. - Uh-huh. What...what's this? We take plastic. Santa card, huh? - Great bank. - Mm-hmm. - Went through fine. - That pickpocketing, crazy old coot. - I'm sorry, sir? - Nothing. Just have to find a guy who played a little trick on me. Thanks. Oh, and, uh, put the guitar on hold for me. - Will do. Merry Christmas, sir. - Yes. Merry Christmas. Excuse me. You remember the guy I was talking to last night? White beard, a little on the round side? - No, sir. - We were sitting right there. Glasses. You don't remember? - I remember you talking to yourself. We get a lot of that during the holidays. No. No, that can't be. Things have been a little weird. - Mr. Ryebeck? Yeah. No, no. Hi. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. My name is Eddie. I'm Mr. Kringle's personal assistant. Don't...don't go anywhere. Just wait there just a moment. - I'll be with you in a minute. - No hurry. Sorry about that, I was on my way to see you and I got tangled up in the TV signal. Just shows you what a terrible sense of direction I have. - How'd you do that? - That? That was just a little bit of Christmas magic. You see, I'm an elf. A Christmas elf. Now since Kris is on vacation and he's put you in charge, I'm not too proud to admit we've been a little Topsy-turvy, we've been like a ship without a captain. More specifically a sleigh without a driver. We've got so little to do and so much time. So much time and so little to do. Wait. We have so much to do and so little time to do it you are expected at the north pole. - Oh. The north pole. Well, why didn't you say so? Sure. - Great. We're not allowed to interfere with free will, but since you said yes, hold on. This may tickle. - May I have your attention, everyone? I would like to introduce Mr. Daniel ryebeck. Let's give him a warm welcome. - This is crazy. Where am I? - The north pole. Santa's office, of course. Eddie, where'd you find this guy? On a turnip truck? - Okay, mm-hmm. I want to talk to the man in charge. - We better get started. - Is Santa pulling another joke? - I remember the time he said we were switching from reindeers to roosters. That was so humiliating. - This is not a joke. These are your naughty and nice glasses. You've already been given your Santa card, so the only thing left to do is show you the orientation video. So, you're Santa. I know, it's crazy. You're probably freaked out. That's all right. All you have to do is follow a few simple Santa rules. Rule number one. As Santa it is your mission to deliver Christmas for the world. - Okay. - No, sit down, shh, shh. - Use your Santa power wisely. With a simple snap of your finger you can make it snow. With your Santa Midas touch, you'll have Christmas at your fingers. Rub your hands together, you can make music, magic, or mistletoe. Rule number three, only use your Santa card in case of emergency. Rule number four, all elves must obey your every command. Oh, this is nutty as a fruitcake. - Clearly, someone needs to have a word with the big man himself about this. Call him on his cell. - Absolutely not. Santa was crystal clear about this. Mr. Ryebeck is in charge. Now, Dan. Dan. I'm sure you have many questions. Now, I have been Santa's executive assistant for a very long time. So feel free to ask me anything you want. - Here's one. Is this real? - Yup. - So rule number four, elves must obey? - That's right. - Here's an order. Get me outta here. Okay, Wha... What just happened? - Oh, I missed again. I was trying to get us inside. - What, are you a hypnotist? - No, I eat almost anything. - Okay, you just leave me alone. I'm clearly dreaming. Just need a coffee. Yeah. - With your Santa Midas touch you'll have Christmas at your fingers. - That was amazing. - Yes. Yeah, that was amazing. - How'd you do that? - Christmas magic. - Whatever. Maybe... Maybe I'm not dreaming. Hi. I'd like a latte and that entire basket of candy canes. Oh, uh, do you take Santa card? Here you go. A candy cane for you, sir. And one for you. Happy holidays. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. Free candy canes for one and all. 'Scuse me, sir, candy cane for you. Merry Christmas. Oh... - Is this your car? - You got something to say about me towing your car? - No. No, just... Just that you have been exceptionally good. And you deserve those Italian pumps. - Thanks. I think so too. But how did you know? - Lucky guess. Merry Christmas. - Yes. Merry Christmas also. Oh, and take care of those parking tickets. I could get used to this. - Dan. - Holy cow, Eddie, don't sneak up on me like that. - Look at this. Look at it. What do you see? - Multicolored squiggly lines on a graph? - Those multicolored squiggly lines are the magic in a nosedive. You've been here for five minutes. You're already abusing the system. Knock it off. - Knock what off? - Misusing the magic. It's not there as your plaything. It is the power that allows stockings to be stuffed the world over in a single night. - This is too powerful of a tool not to be leveraged a little bit. - Exactly, which is why your whims, not to mention the illegal activity of ticket fixing, are not the founding principles that the magic was founded on. - Sorry. I gotta go. - No, hold on. You have a Santa suit fitting in 30 minutes. Where do you think you're going? - I gotta get these gifts to my kids. - Make it snappy. Hey. - Dan, are you okay? - Linda, I am better than okay. I just had the most amazing morning ever. Kids, hey, come over here. I have a little Pre-Christmas surprise for you. There you go, buddy. - Dad! You found the new one! - You bet I did, kiddo. And this is for you. - Dad, you bought it? - Yes, I did. Awesome. - Dan, what's this all about? - My ship...Sleigh came in. - But Dan, you can't afford these things. - Yes I can, Linda. And... I got a little something for you too. Huh? What do you think? - We'll talk about this later. The sitter's gonna be here any minute and I have to meet with Trevor to tour the new property. Trevor, I...Really, again? - Yeah, Trevor. He's my boss. We have to tour the new property before new year's. We have a ton to do to make it look presentable and this week is gonna be crazy. - Okay, then... Then let me help you. - What are you talking about? - Whatever you need. I want to help share the load. In fact, I would like your permission to spend a little extra time with the kids 'cause I want to give them the best Christmas they have ever had. - But I thought you didn't like Christmas. And with your new mall Santa job and all the other projects you always get up to I hired babysitters for the rest of the week. - Well, hey, cancel them all. 'Cause that is all about to change. In fact, why don't I take the kids off your hands tonight? - Sure, you're on. - Yeah. Linda, it is going to be a very merry Christmas. Oh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta get fitted for my Santa suit. Joe, bye, buddy. Bye, Sally! Where's Eddie? He'll be back in a minute. First we gotta get you suited up. You're a lot thinner than Kris. You should try some of my aunt Fanny's apple pie. That should put some more meat on your bones. People expect a jolly, fat Santa. And where is your beard? You're not even trying to grow one. I'll be back to finish your fitting. - All right, I have the owner's manual to Santa's sleigh. You better start reading it. The sleigh is powered by the north pole's magnetic field so you have to have a working knowledge of astrophysics. - What about the reindeer? - No, no, no, no. They are used only for emergency backup purposes. Santa just likes them there for tradition. - Oh. - All right, what we have now is the latest letters to Santa for your attention. - Wait. I have an idea. This year everybody gets whatever they want. - Well, no, you have to cross-check the letters against the naughty and nice list. - Nobody's naughty. Everybody gets a break. - But... - Look, I have seen a lot of disappointment in my life. This year no one gets disappointed. Understood? - Fine, then I'm gonna need your authorization to bring in more elves. - Yeah, sure, whatever it takes. More the merrier, just make sure they're well paid. - We're paid in cookies. - Okay, good, so we got that covered. Just take me home. - This is your new home. - No, no, I need to go home-home. - Dan, you are Santa. - I have a very special Christmas wish I have to fulfill. - And what's that? - I have to win back my family. And I'm running out of time. - And what about Christmas for the rest of the planet? - Well, like I said, everything for everyone. You got that covered, right? Good, okay. Gotta go. Sparkle me back, or whatever you do. Now. - Oy Vey. - Oy Vey? - I'm a Hanukkah elf too, on my father's side. Oh! Eddie! Eddie, you really need to work on your sparkling. All right. Get to work, Santa. - I'm sorry to bother you, sir. I just... I'm worried that Mr. Ryebeck isn't gonna work out. - Just give him time, Eddie. Just give him time. Hot, hot. Merry Christmas, Linda. - Hello, Dan. What's with the Santa suit? - I am just getting in the spirit for my mall Santa job. - Hey, slick. What's up, Sally? You guys ready to go? - Where are you off to? - We are gonna have a little surprise. Joe, do you got the video game? - In my backpack. - All right. Come on, gang. - Bye. - Okay, come on in. No peeking. Ready? Uncover your eyes. Ta-dah! - Wow. - You see all those presents over there? They're all yours. - All of them? - All of them. It's every gift you've ever wanted. From every Christmas list you've written in the past five years. - Whoa. - Come on, what're you waiting for? Go, your presents await. - ♪ hey Santa time to jump on your big old sleigh ♪ ♪ you got a lot of toys to deliver by Christmas day ♪ ♪ come on Santa it's almost Christmas time again ♪ ♪ you had all year to make the toys for the kids ♪ ♪ in all that time we don't know what you did ♪ - Waah! Whoo. I need a break. Oh, and by the way, that video game controller is a lot more advanced than that old one Trevor got you. - Hey, Sally, you want to come join us? - No, thanks, dad. - Want anything to drink? Warm cider? Egg nog? Juice box? - Dad, please. - You know, dad, it's fun to have time to just hang out with you. But there's something different about you. - Well maybe you ought to mention that to mom. - I'll tell her as soon as she gets home. Want to play squire of Wessex? - I sure do. When she gets home? Where is she? - Mom went out to dinner with her boss. - Oh, dinner. With Trevor. - Eh, yeah. Hey, you want to play squire of Wessex now? - Hold that thought, little buddy. I will be right back. Hello, Dan. - Eddie, where the heck are ya? - I'm in the north pole doing your job. - You keep tabs on everybody, right? - So? - Linda is out to dinner with her boss at a French restaurant. I mean, do the math. His name is Trevor Winthrop. I want you to check the naughty list, what do you got? - That is a flagrant misuse of the naughty list. Mr. Kringle would never approve it. - Eddie, never mess with the man who passes out the cookies. - Oh, okay, you just want me to break rule ten. Trevor Winthrop. He's an Oxford graduate, a cricket star, and he does a lot of pro Bono work for different charities. - Cricket? All right, what about the bad stuff? - There's nothing bad. He's a pretty amazing guy. - Okay, well, where is this amazing guy now? - Oh, you don't want me to just break into his file, you actually want me to track him, sure. I don't see anything wrong with that. Let me just go ahead and do that for you. He's at the corner of main street and third, heading west. - I want you to get down here now, to my apartment. I need your help. And that's an order. - You get a little taste of power... - Hey, Sal, Joe. I've got a little errand to run. I'll be back in two shakes of a reindeer's tail. - But dad, you said we were gonna play squire of Wessex. - I know, pal, I'm sorry. My buddy's gonna stop by, babysit. He'll be happy to play with you. - Dad, babysit? I'm 14. Sal... Yeah, that's him. Come in. - I may have taken out your neighbor's decorations by accident. - Guys, this is my friend Eddie. - Hi, kids. - He's gonna look out for you while I'm gone. He is? - I'll be back faster than a partridge can find a pear tree. Do me a favor, just clean the place up a little bit, okay? - Well... Heh. - Thank you for coming tonight. I wanted to talk to you about your future. Now, a new year means a fresh start. New opportunities. - Oh, well, I've certainly enjoyed working for the firm this year, and I hope to continue to do so. - Well, see, I think you haven't been fully appreciated. - Oh, I've never felt that way. - You're the whole package, Linda. Smarts, tenacity, style. - Thank you. - And the way you landed riverside towers, top notch. And I think that you're cut out for something more. - Oh? Oh, well... Thank you. What is it? - Well, it... Um, that's a piece of coal. It was a diamond, but it's a piece of coal. - I should get going. I'm telling you, there was a diamond when I bought it. I'm still not quite sure what happened there. - Huh. Yeah, well, caveat emptor. Black goes with everything, right? - I-I should go. Look, Trevor, you're a great guy. But you're my boss. And as if that weren't awkward enough I mean, sometimes I catch myself thinking there might still be a chance with Dan and... - I understand. Completely. And it's just an opinion, but... I think you deserve someone who can treat you like the royalty that you are. - Well, thanks. - Ooh, you're shivering. Cold? - A little. - I'll make it really cold. - It's snowing. - Maybe we'll have a white Christmas. - It seems pretty localized. Like just in front of this building. - I don't remember that in the forecast. - I should be getting home. - Good-bye. Taxi. - Hey, merry Christmas. - Hey, what's going on? Why aren't you upstairs watching my kids? - They haven't lifted their heads from their video game since you left, they're fine. You are in a tailspin. - What are you talking about? - You're all about personal gain again. - I don't know what you mean. - You turned a wheel lock into a wreath. You took a diamond and changed it into a piece of coal. - That was pretty good, right? - You gotta stop. You're putting things so far out of alignment we'll be lucky to deliver Christmas. - I don't understand. - When you use Christmas magic selfishly, it makes it less stable, more prone to accidents and mishaps. It makes it harder for us to work. And you know what else? We need you to show up and be Santa clause this year. - It's a lot to ask from... From an out-of-work travel agent. - You just gotta show up. - All right. All right. Night. - Dan, one more thing. When you use Christmas magic to buy your family's love, it not only weakens the magic. It makes it harder to actually mend with them. - Look, I gotta get the kids back to Linda's place. Thanks. Hey, mom. - Hi, kids. - So how was your evening? - Odd. I got caught in the blizzard of the century, among other things. - I saw that on the news. Crazy, huh? - I hope your evening was better than mine was. - Kids and I... - It was very interesting. We got to meet a new babysitter. - Yeah, I had to pop out for, like, 30 minutes or so to run some errands. Left the kids with my friend Eddie. - Dan, you left the kids with a stranger? - No, he's not a stranger, he's a good friend. And he's really good with kids. Might even qualify as an expert. Besides, I had something very important to do. - Dan, not more gifts. - Look, Linda... Something big has happened and I think we should get together to discuss it. - What is this? - Open it. It's an invitation. - Dan. - Oh, come on. It's one dinner. I'll sign the papers after the holidays, so one dinner's not gonna make a difference. - I don't know, I have a lot on my mind and a lot on my plate. - Come on, you come over tomorrow I'll explain everything that's been going on. - I don't know. - Do not make me beg here. The kids will see that. That will not be good. - Fine. - Tomorrow night. Great. All right. Bye, kids. Bye, dad. - Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. - What? Are you counting reindeer? - I'm going over the fulfillment reports. This whole "everyone gets everything" is backing up our system big time. - I understand, but Santa was explicit. Follow Mr. Ryebeck's orders and hope for the best. - We're like a rudderless sleigh. - ...careening down a mountain. - ...Made of powdered sugar. - Why do you have to put a positive spin on everything? - You know what, I'm gonna go check in on the new boss. I haven't seen him since last night. - So... What do you think? Blazer or... Just the shirt? - You're wasting time. Christmas is four days away. We have shipments to track and schedules to keep. - Mm-hmm. And how those new elves working out? - They're putting in a lot of overtime but they're getting cookies and a half. - Perfect. - Yeah, until we run out of cookies. - What happens then? - Imagine the world's largest sugar crash. And we have a new problem. The distribution centers... They're overwhelmed worldwide. Have you seriously considered the consequences of giving everyone everything they ask for? - Let's see, joy, happiness, dancing in the streets? Sounds horrible. You worry too much. - You might want to rethink that. - Eddie, I've got important things to focus on. Help me out here. Spruce up the windows or something. - What are you doing? - I am recreating my perfect first date with Linda. I am gonna blow her away. Just like I did back in the day. - We have Christmas. Dan, you're Santa. - Okay, champagne on ice, check. Lobster thermidor in the oven and... A little Sinatra for music. Huh? It's her favorite. What do you think? - I think I'm gonna head back to the north pole and try and hold down the fort. You have to come by tonight after all this. Or else. - Okay, okay, good, just go. - Rob, update. - Sir. - Is that accurate? - Mm-hmm. - Well, get a rapid action team on that right away. Deb! - Sir? - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - I am on a moonlight walk with my missus, Eddie. - Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but this is urgent. An hour ago an entire toy cache destined for Gloucester, England was delivered at the bottom of the Marianas trench. - The glitch can be directly attributed to Mr. Ryebeck's imu. - Imu? - Inappropriate magic usage. - Marianas trench, huh? Well, that's abysmal. - Abysmal. - To say the least, sir... Dan has misused the Christmas magic so much and so often I think it might collapse. - All right, well, here's my decision... Carry on with Dan. He is your Santa this year. And don't be so glum, Eddie. - Well... - Most c-days go off without a hitch. This one will too. Now you have a cache of toys under 36,000 feet of water that you need to deal with, and I have a little stroll to finish. Oh, and Eddie? - Yes, sir. - Don't call me again. - What? Wait. Sir, wait! Great. Here we go. It's a good thing those toy pallets are waterproof. - Hi. - Hi. The place looks great. - Linda, you look phenomenal. - I'm just coming from work. - Well, I hope you brought your appetite because I cooked up lobsters, your favorite. - Oh, that's not necessary. - Well, why not? Reminds me of that time we both surprised each other and brought home lobsters. - Good thing I was pregnant with Joe at the time and eating for two, as I recall. - He does love his lobster, doesn't he? Come on in. No reason we can't catch up over a nice dinner away from all the distractions. Goodness knows I've been a little preoccupied with my projects. But that all stops now. - Great. And wow. I mean, you really decorated. The kids told me it looked amazing. - Well, why not? Here, sit. And, uh...Oh, some music. Look at that. Sinatra. - ♪ Jolly old St. Nicholas ♪ ♪ lean your ear this way ♪ - that's strange. It says Sinatra on the jacket. - ♪ don't you tell ♪ ♪ a single soul ♪ - Hold on a second. - ♪ what I'm gonna say ♪ - I can't hear you. - Old thing's on the Fritz. Anyway. Would you care for some champagne? - Sure. - Whoa! Whoa. Sorry about that. Here. - This smells like egg nog. - It says champagne. - You know, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - Oh. No, Linda. You can't leave. I've cooked up your favorite dish. Lobster thermidor. Voila! - The lobster looks like fruitcake. Is this funny to you? - No, it's... - I'm gonna get going. - Wait, Linda, no, I can explain this. ...i think. Wait, Linda, hold on. No, wait, Linda, don't go. At least take these presents for the kids. - No more presents, Dan. Good night. - Well, that could've gone better. I mean, what the heck was that? Santa songs for Sinatra? Egg nog for champagne? - It's your Christmas Midas thing, remember? You're lucky your underpants didn't turn into Holly. - The date with Linda was a complete fiasco. - You know what? Stop whining. There's three days till Christmas. You have to start making things run smoothly around here and honor your commitment. - Commitment? Eddie, I am trying to win back my family, here. Okay, I'm running out of time. The date with Linda was a train wreck. My kids are treating me like a stranger. My family is slipping away from me. It's like everything I'm trying is backfiring. I need to talk to Kris. - He's on vacation in Bimini. Oh! Wasn't supposed to say Bimini. - Get him on the phone. Please. - I know that he has a reputation for being cheery, but trust me, he's a guy you don't want to bother when on vacation. - Rule number four: An elf cannot refuse Santa's request. - You're gonna invoke rule number four? - Right, let me tell you something. He's not gonna like this. - Just do it. - Sit down. Not there. Over here. You sure you want to do this? - Eddie, this better be important. - Sir, he invoked rule number four. - Hey, Dan. How's it going? Take it you're enjoying your new job? - Well, um... - Well, I know I certainly am enjoying myself. Except for the Parasailing accident. I gotta lose a little weight. - Uh, look, Kris, you got me into this. I need some help. - Yeah... - Why is it that everybody is yelling into my ear what they want for Christmas and yet I can't even tune into what my own family needs? - Kris? Oh. Sorry, Dan. I just got a little sea water in my ear. So, Dan... What I'm thinking here is that your emotions are clouding your Santa senses. - Okay. So what do I need to do? - It's an art, Dan. I mean, it's like driving a sled in the dark or... Getting a 44-inch waist down into a 32-inch chimney. Don't worry about it. You'll get the hang of it. Just cheer up. - But the truth is in a few days I'm gonna lose my family. Like a snowflake in a Gale. - Well, you know, Christmas magic is very powerful. But there's a greater magic right there. - So what does that mean? - It means, Dan, that you're just not going about all of this in the right way. - Well, I must be because if I can finally get my family everything they've ever wanted, I can prove to them I'm the hero I've always wanted to be and not just some failure and things are still not going my way. - Well, your intentions are great, Dan. But you're so busy showing off and trying to be the hero that you don't have time to just be a father. A real gift is not a toy. It's your genuine love. - Yeah. I-I think I get that. Thank you. - Well, if we're done here. - Yes, sir. - I've got to get back to my vacation. Cowabunga! Whoa! - Well, boss, what do you want to do? - You know, I think you should take me home. - What's with the picture? - I remember being so disappointed with that sweater. Seeing the picture, I look so happy. - That's because you were. You may not have gotten the presents that you wanted, but your parents gave you a pretty amazing gift every day. I mean, of all the places in the world there's nowhere that this family would rather be than together. In the north pole, we call that love. - Yeah. I intend to get my family that gift too. Oh, Eddie, one more thing. I think I owe you an apology. I have been a lousy manager. But... That all changes. - Cookies? For me? - Well, they were just baked potatoes, but with the Christmas Midas touch... All right, let's get a move on. We got a Christmas to make happen. - Can we finish the cookies first? - All right, what's the situation? - Well, not good. The clock is ticking, manufacturing's behind, and morale is crumbling like a gingerbread. And the word in the elf break room is you're a pushover. - Pushover? What do they mean by that? You haven't been working very hard. Which means the elves don't think they have to work hard. All right, what can I say? You give an elf an inch, they take a Christmas mile. And a Christmas mile is 3.14 human miles. - 3.14...isn't that pi? - Really? Right now? With everything going on you're gonna think about holiday food? You have a meeting right now. Elves... Where do we stand? - The supply lines are all backed up. I got an order for 10 million buster bowwow dolls so I shifted manpower to handle it. And now I find out it was a clerical error! - Someone hacked the database and took the chocolate machines offline. That means all cocoa-based stocking stuffers are running late. - So blitzen's got symptoms that could be hoof-and-mouth. - And maintenance didn't replace the non-stick floor tiles like I requested so now I have baking elves slipping on melted butter! - Hold it! I'm in charge here. Come on, guys. Let's remember our priorities here. We are responsible for delivering happiness to over 500 million kids. Guys, I need you. I can't do this alone. You know, when I was a kid, Christmas was always a disappointment. But now when I think of disappointing even one child, no. No, that is not happening. Not on my watch. So listen up. I want progress reports from each and every one of you by the end of the day. I want to know your specific benchmarks for your team and I want to know exactly how we're going to achieve our goals. In the meantime, I'm gonna draw up a battle plan. Oh, and, uh, one more thing. I brought along a little motivation. - Enjoy. Okay. - All right, team. Let's do this. - Saw what you did there. - Oh. Sorry. - What for? - Well, for using the magic like that. - That's how it's supposed to be used. What does it profit you to decorate Linda and Trevor's place like that? Nothing. - Yeah. I guess I'm getting good at this. - Yes, sir, you are. - All right, let's go. - Where are we going? - Well, didn't you come down here to get me so we could go back to work? - I just came down here to tell you that I think you're doing a great job. In fact, can I show you something? - What am I looking at? - This is magic metrics. Or a Christmas analytics, if you will. - In English, please. - It basically says that everything's okay. The magic is right where we need it to be to deliver Christmas. - Great. - Which is to say we don't think we need you tonight. Why don't you go spend time with your family? You've earned it. - I...Thanks, Eddie. - Come in. - Hey. - Dan, you look exhausted. - I'm doing double duty with my mall Santa job. - Must be a busy mall. - The kids'll be down in just a minute. - Great. You seem happy. - Yeah, well, last night somebody vandalized... Or should I say decorated the property we were showing and today we got a huge turnout. - Imagine that. Well, congratulations. Hey, I just wanted to take a moment to apologize. Dinner at my place went a little off kilter. So much has been happening I just... My head was spinning. - It's okay. - And one last thing. I was thinking it'd be really nice if we could get together as a family and do something like we used to. I think it'd be good for the kids. - Dan, I don't know. - No, no, no more gifts or anything like that, just quality time with the family and the spirit of Christmas. You remember all the fun we used to have. The ice skating and caroling and tree trimming. What happened to that? - I guess everything fell by the wayside while we were trying to keep everything else going. Kids have been bounced in between our houses like a couple of ping-pong balls. - Yeah. So tomorrow night? Ice skating? They would love it. - Fine. - Great. - See you later. - You going out to Trev's? His name is Trevor, Dan. And yes, he's my boss. We have a lot of work this week, so... - Okay. Have a great time. - Thanks, Dan. - Kids, come on, we gotta go! All right. Let's get outta here. Come on. Okay, guys. Tonight is gonna be great. 'Cause guess what we're gonna do. - More shopping? - No. - What, are you gonna buy us more gifts? - No again. We are gonna have an old-fashioned Christmas. Because as your grandpa ryebeck used to say, you can't put a price on love. - What happened to your big tree? - Oh, well, the neighbor couldn't afford one so I gave it to her. I got this little guy. - Dad, this tree looks like it should be put out of its misery. - What? Come on. All this needs is a little decoration. Watch. - Quality. - Dad, I'll help you decorate your tree. - All right, decorations are on the counter. - ♪ deck the halls with boughs of Holly ♪ ♪ fa la-la la-la, la-la la-la la-la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ fa la-la la-la, la-la la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ fa la la la la la la la-la la-la ♪ ♪ troll the ancient yuletide Carol ♪ ♪ fa la-la la-la, la-la... ♪ - Oh, that hurt. - Yes! - Oh, I got a bow and arrow. - Flames coming, flames... Wait, wait. What's...ow! Whoa, that hurt, Joe. - Yeah, oh! - Yes! - Oh! All right, all right, I surrender. You two win. - See, Joe? That's why forming alliances with your sister is smart. Because we owned dad. - I would say that's true if I didn't let you two win. - Sure, dad. The trick to winning is to think outside the box. Why swim the moat or scale the walls when you could catapult in? Want to play again? - Uh, no thank you. - I can't believe you haven't even checked your messages in four hours. - Oh, I should do a quick check-in. And then I'll just turn it right back off. - Dude, dad, I dig your new ringtone. - Oh, thank you. Gotta get back to work. After I make some hot cocoa. I'll be right back. - Hey, do you think he let us win? - No, I think we beat him fair and square. - No cocoa. - I'm telling you, dad's different. Suddenly he's crazy for Christmas. Doesn't he seem a little overly merry to you? - Yeah, mom said that he would be taking this mall Santa job seriously, but I never expected this. - Look, I saw him make cocoa out of tap water. - What, do you want him to use bottled water? - That's not what I mean. It was magic. My theory... I think dad's Santa. - Okay, kiddo. It's time for you to go to bed before mom hears you talking like this and assumes that you have a fever. - Seriously. Look at the evidence. He's able to give any gift and he's super jolly. - Dad's a mall Santa, Joe. Big difference. - You see him driving reindeer, you owe me big time. You'll see. - I gotta hand it to you, you're not half the manager that Mr. Kringle is, but you're getting the hang of this. - Coming from you that's high praise. - Not out of the woods yet. Just make sure that before you leave you check the transit schedule. - What transit schedules? - These transit schedules. From all the different divisions. - Games, dolls, wind-ups. It's the last thing we check. - Wait, I'm supposed to go ice skating with my family soon. - Just make sure there's no overlap in the delivery schedules and routes. - Okay, and make sure you sign off on everything after you've had a chance to review them all. Have fun. - There's more, sir. - More? I'll catch up later. - Hello. - I thought dad was supposed to come skating with us. Bet you he isn't gonna show up. - Hey, gang. - Hey. Since when did you get so good? - Well, just something I picked up along the way. Come on, guys. - Dan, I said no more presents. - It's not a present, it's a gift. - Well, it's been years since I skated. - You'll pick it up in no time. Come on, guys. Let's do it. All right. Come on, Sally. You can do it. - I hate this. I'm gonna fall. - You got it. Here. There you go. You got it. Give it a sec. Used to skate like a pro when you were little. - Yeah, dad, I'm not little anymore. - I know. - Okay, my center of balance is all off. - Whoa, whoa. Hey. You all right? Your grandpa ryebeck used to say if you fall off the horse you gotta just get right back up and try again. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. - Hey, I'm speaking to you as an expert. Come on, you got this. Just focus. - I can't. I feel like I'm being watched. - Okay. Ready? I'm not watching you. I'm not watching you. I'm trying not to watch you. You got this. Come on. Step and glide. - There you go. - Music would be nice. - How'd you do that? - Magic. - Please, dad. You preprogrammed the pa system. - You remember this song? - How could I not? You let me listen to it every night. - Yeah, I used to play this for you when you were a baby. Just focus on the music. Tune everything else out. - ♪ Ho, ho, ho who wouldn't go ♪ - There you go. Eddie, you can wait. - You gonna get that? - Not on your life. Hey, sporto, how you doing? - Come on, Dan, answer your phone. Come on. Pick it up, pick it up. Sounds like you're wanted. - I know. Wow. They're so grown up. What do they need us for? Got a couple pros out there. - They haven't been this happy in a long time. They said they had a blast last night. - Oh, we sure had fun. Sally can be a bit more challenging than I remember. What happened to our little girl? - I'll tell you what happened. While you were so busy with your projects she became a teenager. - Yeah. Well, I guess I got a long way to go with her. Feels like a start. You know, I've always justified working 24/7 as something I'm doing for the family. But maybe it's more for my own ego. - We always wanted you to succeed, it's just when you were away so much we wanted you to come back home. Maybe that's still a possibility. - Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Especially this week. Why don't you come over for Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow night? - I would love that. - You're not answering your phone. We got a situation. At the...The mall. It's getting out of hand. - Colleague from work. - Oh, it sounds like there's an emergency. Anyway, it's my turn to skate with the kids. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Tomorrow night. Bye, kids! Love you! Have fun! That's great. Just great. Would you look at this? This is worse than the Christmas of 1812. That's when Santa got a stomach virus and everything went kerflooey. - So what do we do to fix all this? - You tell me. Blitzen's out so we got seven reindeer. We've got 20 distribution routes and 500 million toys that have to reach kids' homes or stores within the next 24 hours. What we need is a miracle. - Or a really good travel agent. - I don't like this. Santa never broke in anywhere. - Oh, please. The guy goes down peoples' chimneys. That isn't exactly ringing the doorbell. Besides I have a lease till the end of the year. - Well you better be right. I don't think you can post bail with a plate full of cookies. What exactly are we doing here? - So Santa can't go any faster? - Not unless you want to see tiny reindeer bumping into stuff. - Okay, so we're figuring out how to reroute a few hundred million toys on commercial flights then avoiding major flight corridors so the sleigh can deliver the rest. It's what I do. Okay, we're gonna fix this if it takes all night. - Oh, thanks. - You're welcome. - What a wonderful credit to your capabilities. All units rented, and on a holiday. That was genius. Decking the place out with fantastic decorations. Really drew 'em in. - I wish I could claim credit for it, but I can't, really. - And modest too. So any special plans for Christmas Eve? - I'm just spending it with my family. It's been an exhausting Christmas season. You? - Oh, delivering food to some area soup kitchens and then caroling at several senior centers. - It's great that you do that. - Well, you know, back home my family has some wonderful traditions. Christmas Eve we all go down to bond street and look at the window displays and then we have a big Christmas dinner with Figgy pudding and then Christmas morning it's high tea with clotted cream and then we all go cardio climbing the stairs of big Ben. - That sounds like fun. - It is. You know, you should come next year. With the kids, of course. You could meet my family. - That's funny, somehow I can't imagine my kids having high tea. - Linda, I'm serious. - Really? - The way I see it is that there are two types of men in this world. There are the dreamers and there are the doers. And it's the doers who are the ones who can make dreams come true. Your carriage awaits. - Look, Dan, we've been at this all night. You need a break? - No, let's keep going. - All right, well, we've got headwinds in the pacific right near Manila. - We're gonna have to reroute. We can't go through Tonga. I had a refueling problem there once. We were delayed for hours with red tape. - I don't want red tape. - Boom, Samoa. Reroute the pacific via Samoa, I'll text my rep in pago pago to facilitate next. - Air traffic control in London is down. We have to avoid any flights that are coming out of backed up Northern Europe. - All right, we got a plane full of Teddy bears, we can go through Lisbon. - Book it. - Done. Okay... 400 more first-class tickets on the old Santa card, and... - Boom. Hi, Linda. - I'm just calling to make sure you're still coming to dinner tonight. The kids are really looking forward to it, and apparently Sally has some sort of performance planned. - Really? Linda, I can't wait. Oh, and don't cook anything. Just put your feet up 'cause I am bringing dinner tonight. - You sure? - Absolutely. Don't make promises I can't keep anymore. - Dan, where are you? I hear some sort of noise in the background. - Um, just at the old office. - Dan, just let it go. What are you trying to prove? - It's not what you think. - And here I was thinking that you'd changed. - Linda, trust me, there's nothing to worry about. And I will be there. So just enjoy your time with the kids and I'll see you soon. - Okay. Bye. - We got a monsoon in India and a blizzard in Idaho. - I am on it. Whoa. I can't believe we just worked 24 hours straight. Got a few hours left but we're still in the game. - Well, it's Christmas Eve. There's always more to do. - Exactly. Which is why I want to see my family. So before you yell at me or... - Relax. You earned it. I'll see you back at the pole in two hours. Not a minute more, all right? There's always last-minute logistics to attend to and you gotta suit up to drive the sleigh. - I'll be there. Hey, uh, Eddie, I couldn't have done this... Any of this, without you, so thank you. - Don't mention it. - You're a good man. Or elf. - Like I said, don't mention it. - He's really gotta teach me how he does that. All right. Oh, this should cover it. Thank you. - Thank you. I'm...I'm afraid your card seems to have been declined, sir. - Oh, just run it again, please. - I did, sir. It is definitely being declined. - Well, that can't be. - Perhaps you'd like to use another card or cash. - Or maybe you'd like to call your bank. The... The bank of the north pole. - Well, I'm sure it's a mistake. Make a quick call and clear it up. - Santa card customer service. - Yes, hello, my card has been declined. - How can I help you, Mr. Ryebeck? - Yes, that's me. - Did you attempt to use the Santa card? - Yes, it was the Santa card. - I'm afraid you've reached your limit, Mr. Ryebeck. - Look, what do you mean limit? - No further purchases are authorized. - No, please. I'm Santa. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Ryebeck. - Hello? Hello? - Alphonse? - Oui, monsieur? - Take all this back to the kitchen, please. - So we just wanted to pop by and wish everyone a merry Christmas. - Thank you. I hope you're having a good Christmas Eve. - Yes. Yes, it's fine. Much better after seeing you. - So late, I brought no food. - Trevor's car? - Okay, who's hungry for dessert? Ho, ho, ho. - Couldn't let my best agent go unrewarded this Christmas Eve. - Oh, thank you. That looks so... Fancy. Genuine Christmas fruitcake flown in from harrod's of London. It's so good. I had to share. Kids. - I don't want any. Dad said he was gonna come and he didn't. He's just like he used to be. - Hey, I'm sure he had something come up. - Joe. - I'm sorry. We're having a uniquely memorable Christmas Eve. I blew it. Again. Oh... Yeah, Eddie. - I told you to be back here in two hours. - I know I said, I... - Yeah, I know you know. I'm sure you know how late you are. Have you even checked the transit schedule? - Yes, I looked at the transit schedules. Or most of them, anyway. - We're having a total shipping breakdown. A system-wide snafu. Look... Cookies are depleted. Not even a crumb. The elves are very upset. - Hey, when your business is run on sugar I guess it's bound to eventually crash, right? - For better or worse, you are the man in charge. If you don't get back here and in charge, Christmas is gonna be ruined by your very hand! - Okay. Yes. - ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of Holly ♪ ♪ fa la-la la-la, la-la la la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ fa la-la la-la, la-la la la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ fa la-la, la la-la, la la la ♪ ♪ troll the ancient yuletide Carol ♪ - Over here! - Kris. - Hey, Dan. Merry Christmas. - So... How's vacation? Well, got this killer suntan and I'm loving the warm weather. - Great. - Say, you look a little low. I guess pulling off Christmas isn't as easy as it seems, is it? - Well, that's an understatement. You know I messed it all up. And I let down my family again. - Well, at least you finally got to give your family all those presents you wanted to, right? - Yeah. Looking back, I don't really feel like it's made much of a difference. Well, imagine that. - When I was a kid, on Christmas morning I'd open my presents and then I would see what all the other kids got and I wished so much I'd gotten what they did. - Hmm. - I was blinded by the amazing gifts. I didn't see what I already had was the best gift of all. My family. I want that for my kids too. You know that Christmas morning feeling when you just know you're surrounded by people who love you? Is that too much to ask? - Anything is possible on Christmas. All it takes is a little faith. Well, you still got your Santa powers for a few more hours. What are you gonna do to enjoy them? - I know exactly what I'm gonna do with them. But it doesn't take any powers at all. Kris, thanks for putting your confidence in me. I'm sorry I let you down. - Dan, Christmas isn't over yet. - Dan. - Hi. Do you have company? - Well, Trevor was here a few hours ago but he left. Come on in. - I'm really sorry I missed dinner. Are the kids asleep? - Yeah. I threw together a meal. - Thanks. Are they all right? - Their dad missed Christmas Eve dinner. They're not exactly over the rainbow. - I screwed up, Linda. I really screwed up. - I've heard it all before, Dan. - I'm not talking about business, though. I'm talking about what matters most. Family. The kids. You. Okay, look, just do me a favor. Tell the kids merry Christmas for me. And that I love them more than they'll ever know. I'm sorry. - Wait. Do you want to sit down and have an egg nog? Trevor brought over a gallon and it would be a shame to waste it. - Uh, sorry. Yes, sure.

I'm gonna go get Dan and bring him back. - Willie, Ronnie, get to the distribution center and see what you can do in the meantime. - Sounds like some raccoons are having a party on our garbage cans. - Yeah, something tells me I should get that. - It's time. - No, not now. - We gotta get you in the suit. - Eddie, does it have to be me? - You have to wear the suit before worldwide Christmas magic takes effect. Now we may only have enough time to deliver half the presents, but that's better than no presents at all. Come on. - Dad? - Mom, what's going on? - Great. Now the kids are awake. - Why is Eddie here? - Hi, Eddie. - Hi. - Wait, you know this guy? - Yeah, he was the new babysitter. - Kids, I'm so sorry about Christmas Eve dinner. You see... Can I tell them? - Give it a shot. Linda, there's something I've been trying to tell you. And kids, you might as well know too. You know how things have been a tad, well, strange the past few days? - That's one way of putting it. - Okay. This might be hard to believe. But I'm Santa Claus. - I knew it! I knew it! I told you, Sally. Dad's Santa! - What? - Linda, it's true. - And you're what, his assistant? - Executive assistant. Christmas elf, polar division. Linda, you've always liked a white Christmas, right? - It's snowing outside. - Dad made it snow. - It's a coincidence. Okay, then... - That is... - Awesome. - That's what I've been trying to tell you. - I told you! - Boss, we're running out of time. - Okay. Gang, I love you all very much. I'm so sorry I missed Christmas Eve dinner. And that is the last time I'll ever do that. - The guy might've missed a few things. Messed up royally this week, but that's only when he was trying to make Christmas happen for a few billion people. In my book, he did pretty well. - Okay. Sparkle us out. - Strap in. - Our dad just sparkled. - You don't see that every day. - I'm no fashion expert, but this isn't working. - That's because they didn't take it in enough. This is why you should've come to your final fitting. You know what, we've got bigger problems. It looks like there's a bottleneck in gift delivery. - All right, well, we've already used every spare plane seat and cargo delivery. - The sleigh only holds so much. All right, we're gonna be lucky to get half the presents delivered. Beyond that it's just not gonna work. - We can't let that happen. We just gotta think outside the box. Wait a minute. If you have to swim a moat or scale a wall, try a catapult instead. - Excuse me? - It's something my son said. Eddie, I think we can solve this. The sleigh works on Christmas magic, right? What if we load it up and catapult it around the south pole? The reverse polarity might actually speed it up like how airlines use the jet stream. - You don't want to go to the south pole. It's all penguins and no toys. But... It might work. Someone has been reading the owner's manual to Santa's sleigh. Very impressive. Elf alert, elf alert. Please move all of the remaining gifts into Santa's sleigh. Everything and the kitchen sink. Mauricio, that was a joke. Do not move the kitchen sink. Good work, elves. Good work. With the sleigh weighted down that much it's gonna be dangerous. Santa, are you sure you're up for it? - Eddie, I've been wanting to be a hero all my life. And if it means saving Christmas, I'll take the risk. - Well, that might not be necessary. Somebody call for backup? Mr. Kringle! Eddie, I need to talk to Dan for a moment. - Ah. It's just so good to see you, Mr. Kringle. - Eddie, you did a terrific job while I was gone. Now, look. There is some warm water out there and a surfboard if you care to. Thank you, Santa. - Thank you. - Good-bye, Dan. Cowabunga! - This is a pretty tough suit to fill. So I see. - I have made a real mess of Christmas. So what do we do now? - Well, I think there's plenty of Christmas magic left to do the job. - You knew this would happen, didn't you? That I'd botch the job? - But I knew that you'd come through it. Dan, I knew that you needed to have everything that you thought you wanted. - To realize that everything I ever needed I already had. There you go. So I got this. Go on and enjoy your holidays. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, mom. - Hey, do you think maybe Dad'll come? - He's probably halfway across the world right now. - Sorry, kiddo, but if dad is standing in for Santa those are some pretty big boots to fill. - You're probably right. - But I bet he's thinking about you both. - He certainly is. Dad! - Come on, gang. - Dan. What about your job? - Well, I am afraid it's over. The real guy whose job it was came back and I think he can take it from here. - Imagine that. Stepping down from a job where you could have anything you ever wanted with a snap of your fingers. - Not everything. Not everything by a long shot. I brought you something. Something I should've given you a long time ago. Me. And a couple more presents. Son, I hope you like that. And this is for you. Your grandpa made that for me a long time ago. To remind me how much I'm loved. And I hope you remember how much I love you. - Dad, it's great. - And Sally, your grandma made that herself for the family tree. It may not be much to look at, but it's a memory of all of our traditions. And the ones that are yet to come. - No, dad, it's... It's beautiful. - It's funny how easy it is to forget what really counts. - And I have a present for you. - Oh. - Sally, that was beautiful. Someone's been practicing, huh? - Well, like I said, it helps when you don't have someone looking over your shoulder all the time. - Got it. - All right, well, I just wanted to drop those gifts off. Enjoy. - Hey, dad. How 'bout a rematch for squire of Wessex? - Well, I don't want to intrude. - If you're not doing anything else for the rest of the day we'd love for you to stay. - Really? - Really. We would. I would. - Well, then I'd love it too. - Yes! We're together at Christmas. - So who wants to make some waffles? - I'll help. - Perfect. Kids, you go get 'em started. - Okay. I'll be in there in a second. You... Honey. Things have been so crazy. I just... I just want to say Noel. And happy holidays. And merry Christmas. And one other thing. Linda... Will you marry me? Again? - You had me at "Noel." Come here. - Dad's coming home.
