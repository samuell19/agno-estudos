I told you to hold it. Lift it up. Good. Now two kids, come here and hold this post. I said only two, not all of you. That year in boarding school Mother came to visit me only once. It was in Hanukah, during the winter. Then she was ill again and hospitalized, and I didn't see her. When summer came with the ecitement of graduation day, I knew... that I was staying here in school, while my friends were going home for the summer vacation. Where is Aviya? Tell me, why are you dreaming? My mother won't be coming. my mother, I wanted her so much to come, I was so scared she would. We're on, and you aren't even ready. But Pua, it's too big, it's dirty, couldn't you find me something nicer? Please Pua. -That's your costume and it's nice. Why are you crying? Stop crying. I'm not crying. -Relax. It's such a nice play, and you've got a great part, the leading part. If your mother comes she'll be proud. You know she won't come. -ls she still in the hospital? Don't dare talk about my mother. You know she won't come. Take this and go. "On the shores of the sea of Galilee, a pa..." Sing already, you're ruining everything. Eeverything we did... Aviya, "On the shores of the sea of Galilee..." Aviya. We can't count on you. What's wrong with you? You've ruined everything. What's this crying? Look at you. Is this what I came for? To see my girl make a fool of herself? Be quiet! -You witch. It's lice. Your hair is full of lice. Be quiet in here. What's lice doing on my girl? What is this, a concentration camp? You're coming with me. I came out of the hospital and rushed over to your party. Is this your side? Like a fool, I bought you candy, sweets and things, and well, what do I get in return... Iice. You're not coming back to this place. Mom, wait for me. Not so close. There's enough room. Tzika, come home. "Kerosene" Mom, don't! Don't! Why are you doing this to me? Mom! Stop it! My hair! I can't breathe. Mom, enough! Enough! Why are you cutting my hair? Why? Why? We're finished with the lice. My girl won't have lice. I know all about lice. Why Mom? Why? Enough. No need to look now. Hair grows. You'll see. Do you know where to go? It's near the grocer's. Here, give her this also. I made it in occupational therapy. Wait a minute, Wait... Better put on a hat. It's... yes, it's better. Come on down, kid. Please stay out of my way. Point it in my direction. Good. A bit more. This chest, the minute I saw it, I knew I had seen it before. But when? Where? Barzilay, turn the chest over. move it from here. Come with me, Barzilay. Not with force. -O.K. O.K. Barzilay, lift it up. Lift it up. -I am. Lift! Are you a boy or a girl? -That's Partisanke's daughter. Is it true? What haver you got under the hat? Come on, leave her alone. you see, no one has eaten you. Now take the laundry... to Lady Abramson. Yes. O.K., are your hands clean? A small present for her too, handmade. Remember to say "thank you", "please", and "excuse me". She's a lady. Don't disturb. There's a class inside. Oh, such beautiful work! Your mother always gives me something nice... when she returns from the hospital. wait. I'm sorry I don't have any candy, Can I go inside? I won't disturb them. O.K., but quietly, O.K? I want everyone to breathe in and very slowly open your hands. Excuse me, Henya's daughter is here, you know, the seamstress. She wants to watch. Let her, O.K? Quiet girls, the class isn't over yet. Concentrate and stop laughing. Take your seats. O.K... I want you to look at the picture above the piano. Look closely, girls. I'll play something, and each of you will tell me what she sees... In the picture above the piano. We'll listen to the music, and then we'll talk. Hava'le, what do you see? Water and geese swimming, -Yes. and a lot of weeds. -Geese swimming. Yes, right. Miralle, what do you see? They are not geese but swans, and they're swimming and they're happy... that they have lots of air and water. Hold it, I don't understand, Doesn't this picture inspire you? These wonderful tunes... Don't they touch your imagination? I've got imagination and I like music, and these geese are like a family, they go in and out, they... they're really together, playing, they do things all the time, and they... What's your name? Who, me? Aviya. Yes, Aviva, what do you see? Aviya, not Aviva. O.K., what do you see in the picture? An enchanted lake, and a swan floating in the water. Once this swan was a little girl, who felt bad and wanted to die. She's the crazy woman's daughter. And she jumped into the water, and a man who didn't want her to die, saved her by turning her into a swan. Aviya, what kind of a name is Aviya? Just a name. A strange name. Go on with your story, Aviya. And he floated through the lakes, passing the days, knowing... that it was only temporary, only for a while. A beautiful story, do you read many books? It was really a beautiful story. O.K. girls, that's all for today. We'll meet again next week. Think about Aviya's story, and remember to dress... -nicely. See you. I've got a terrible migraine. Where have you been? Where were you? I thought... where is my girl... where is she... It's O.k., Mom, it's O.K. -It's not O.K! It's not O.K! My head. Such a headache. Mom, what kind of a name is Aviya? A beautiful name, a most beautiful name. When you grow up, you'll understand. Finish your yoghurt, don't leave half, It's expensive. -I don't like yoghurt. Food is not eaten to be liked. You've got a moustache. You too. Mom, I'm big now, and I can understand. I want you to tell me about him, about my father. He had a nice voice, he was handsome. A handsome man. Mom, I want to know where he is. Where is my father? I told you, he died a long time ago. Before you were born. A person doesn't die before he sees his own child born. Turn off the light, it's expensive. At night, when mother was asleep, I took out my secret treasure. Mother probably wondered where my father's pictures disappeared to. The pictures that have survived the war, the woods, and the concentration camp. This chest, I knew I had seen it somewhere. They had the same one, the new neighbors. You stepped on the line. Yes you did. Don't cheat. This Partisanke, can't she see that we're playing here? What a nut. Be careful, she'll shout at you. Go call her: "Crazy Partisanke and her bald daughter". Crazy Partisanke and her daughter... I forgot. But it said in the paper that they're distributing 6 eggs today, I want the eggs. So go and buy them from the newspaper, I don't have any eggs, you can search my shop, Mr. Altman, I want the bill please. Why don't you turn this thing off? It doesn't cool at all, it only drills a hole in my head. Henya, why does everything bother you? Good day, sir! I'll be right with you. This is Mr. Gantz, our new neighbor. How do you do? Ma'am. Here, please. Do you know him? -No, they're new. But he looked at you, he knows you. He looked, so he looked. It's nonsense, it's all nonsense. What's going on in that head of yours? Father's picture was blurry and difficult to identify, but there was a resemblance between Mr. Gantz and the picture. Is it possible that... Mr. Gantz is... How old were you in this picture? It's from my sixth birthday. In Haifa. -Why did you leave Haifa? We had some trouble there. -What sort? Do you have any more? -ln the album. Go get them. But I haven't finished playing yet. Doesn't matter. You can play later. O.K. Here. What's your mother's name? Once in Poland her name was Helena, now it's Esther. She could have been called llana. She wanted Esther. And your father? -Max. That's their wedding. What is this? A cross. She's got a cross! What are you doing with the pictures? What? I told you a thousand times not to touch this album, right? I've got to rest, I've got a headache. O.K., I'm going. -Hi, Lena. What is this? Where's mother? We can help put the things away. Did you find a friend, Mashinka? I promised you wouldn't be alone in the new neighborhood, right? I'm Aviya. Pleased to meet you. -I'm Henya's daughter. Gantzush, let me do it. I've prepared dinner for you, something that you like. Do you still love your Lena? The U.N. Forces have aadvanced 1 0 miles today, overcoming fierce opposition from The Chinese Forces, who are planning to attack Seoul. The Deputy Speaker of the Knesset said this morning that a coalition without active participation of the Religious Party, is... Mom, the news is nearly over. Oh, right... Where... Where is the... Where is the list of lost relatives? The Lost Relatives Dept. of The Jewish Agency... received the following names... I can't hear... we need a radio. In a little while I'll buy one. But... -He came to lsrael in May 1 948. Yanek Tiles from Keshnov, Poland... is searching for his cousin, Ben-Eliezer, whose date of arrival in lsrael is unknown. Hana Madursky from Gomel, White Russia, is searching for her brother Elia, who went to Siberia during the War and has since disappeared. These were the names issued by the Dept. of Lost Relatives. Nothing. Nothing again today. You know Mrs. Marisha, from Chic Paris Store? She found her niece who was with me in the camp, just like that, from the radio. Mom, you'll find too. In our boarading school there's a girl who's found her father. She was sure he died in the war, but he lived, and now he's got a new wife and new kids, and she even went to visit them. Well, that's luck. Excuse me, may l? Please. -Can you please mend what's needed and iron, of course, and I thank you very much. It will be O.K., when it's ready, my girl will bring it back. Please sit down, Mr. Gantz. Something cold to drink? -Yes, thanks. Prepare something cold for Mr. Gantz. I don't smoke much. I haven't smoked for a long time now. But if I smoke, then only American Blend. So they sat and talked, and mother was relaxed. They were beautiful together. Everything looked so natural, so right. Health isn't everything in life. Are you still here? You can go, I can do this myself. Stop it. Stop fighting. Stop fighting already. What's this banging? It's you. What is this smell? What is it? Gantzy, we have to pay the girl. What is this smell? Of course, it's Henya's laundry. Thank your mother. Mashinka, learn from Aviva. Aviya! Not Aviva. But in Poland they called me Maxi. Look how she helps her mother. Everything you touch becomes dirty. I can't do without help. You like the smell of Henya's laundry. Do they always fight like this? Is it the problems in the bank? Look, we can be real good friends, just like sisters. I'm sorry, but I have to go, I'm late to Maya's already. Did you bring the laundry? -No. I also want to... Like that? Go tell your mother to give you something nice to wear, just like all the other girls. Dressing nice is compulsory. Mom! Give me something nice to wear, something pretty. Hurry! What for? What's the occasion? It's for the dancing lessons at Maya's. Hurry Mom, they're starting already. What you're wearing is fine. It's clean, tell her it's clean! -No. Come here, I'll tie the scarf like a plane, a real butterfly. You don't seem to understand me, you can't come in dressed like that. Maya, go back inside. I'll deal with her. Listen! Stop bothering us. Mom, she won't let me in. Mom, she won't let me in. She doesn't if you're not dressed nicely. Not dressed nicely? Why, the princess, who does she think she is? The Queen of England? It's clean. Go tell her that it's clean. Hurry up, they'll finish soon. Don't you understand? She hates baldies. What you're wearing is nice! It's nice! Go over to her and tell her that I said that it's much nicer than her face. The bitch! Get away from here, you ignorant girl. You're not getting in. Maya, open up! Open up! -You're breaking the door, get away from here. Get away, do you hear? Maya, come out! Maya, come out! Maya Abramson, come out! I've got something to tell you, princess. Tell me, are you crazy? Stop shouting like mad. I'll call the police. You're disturbing us. You're a bitch! I wish you'd die! You're not the Queen of England! You're a bitch! You and your mother. I told you to go, you ignorant girl. Great! -Great! Go call your Partisanke. Go away, we don't want you here. Go, baldy! -I'll kill you. I'll kill you. My eye! Help! Someone help! Maya's dead, her eyes are bleeding. You're crazy, look what you've done. Call a doctor, help! Is the ambulance coming? -Don't ask questions. Not now, clear the way. Maya, get well! Maya, hurry back. The lady can sit up front. -Please. -Thank you. Maya, get well! -See you, Maya! What's happening? I don't know exactly, something with Abramson's daughter. It's your delinquent daughter. she should be locked up, that daughter of yours. -My girl? Where is my girl? Aviya! Aviya, "Partisanke". Stop shouting like crazy, "Partisanke". Come on home, Aviya, where are you? Enough, Henya, enough. Take your delinquent kid and get out of this neighborhood. We don't want you here. She can't see with both eyes. That's all we need... eyes. We'd better pray that she'll see. Dad, make her see again. I didn't mean Maya to go blind. Just make her see again. I didn't mean it, I'll be such a good girl, I'll stay up like this all night. I'll even die, just make Maya see again. That whole night I spent praying and begged God and my father. I hurt myself on purpose. I swore not to change... the painful position of my body and stay like that till morning. To show Him that I'm sorry, that I'm punishing myself, that I regret what I have done. Who are you looking for, kid? For Maya Abramson. She's going to have her eyes operated on. You can't walk around in the corridor. A hospital isn't a place for kids. Please leave immediately. So could you just give her this? What? -Flowers. -From who are the flowers? What shall I tell her? Girl, girl. hurry up, hurry up! Hedva is a coward. Get out of here, you're no good. we don't want to play with you. Dummy! -We don't want to be around you. Scram! Scram! Crazy Partisanke and her delinquent kid. It's a pleasure talking to a pretty lady. -Thank you. Regards to your wife. How was it at Friedman's? -Actually it was O.K. I managed a lot. You know they got a wedding dress from America, and their daughter is so fat... I have to take out here and there. And... it's a lot of work. They make such a big fuss over the wedding, you'd think it's the only wedding around. So where did Mr. Gantz come from? How'd I know where he came from? From the sky, maybe... or from his work in the bank. What's going on in that head of yours? -Lots of things. Doctor... Here are all the papers... How is she? Was she ill? -May I help you? -Yes. I'm looking for Maya Abramson. What? -Maya Abramson. Nose Ear and Throat, third floor. No, she's looking for Maya Abramson, from room 2. What are you doing here? You know it's forbidden to be here. Come in the afternoon, it's not visiting time now. Mira, wait a minute. Hanalle, is it you? No, I'm looking for Maya Abramson. She was just taken to surgery. What are you dreaming about? Eat up, you haven't touched a thing. I'm eating. That's not food, you have to eat this. You need strength, you're grow now. Growing. Don't correct my Hebrew all the time. I speak very good Hebrew. I too have a lot of things on my mind. Mom, there's someone outside. What do you want? Go away from here. Go. What do you want? -Don't speak Hebrew. What do you want? Gantz lives over there, turn left... Where are you from? -From there... Well, Mrs Henya. -l... It's a real miracle. I thought that he... Would you believe it, Mrs Henya... to get out of Auschwitz alive? One member of an entire family... Alter, would you like some juice? Alter, don't you know me? I'm Henya. Nushka. -Nushka. Beautiful Nushka. He recognized her, he knew who she was. "Beautiful Nushka". That's how the Partisans named her. She fought in the woods. Her beauty and courage made her a legend. My mother was a real heroine. And here they called her "Partisanke". Maya, there's a nice girl here, who came to visit you. What's the matter? Don't you feel well? No, I'm fine. There. Hey, kiddo. So nice of you to come. What is this? Who is it? -Aviya. Maya, you have to forgive me. I didn't mean to throw a stone at you. I really didn't mean to throw it. Please, don't cry. I can't take it. The doctors said that I'll be fine. They promised me that I'll see. You don't have anything to worry about. Come here, sit next to me. I think you'd better leave now, it tires Maya. Will you come again? -Every day, 'till you get well and leave the hospital. Say, Alter, do you remember my mother and Gantz? From there, right? And how were they separated? And will they get together again? When? Oh, it's a secret. But when, when will it be? "Yes" what? You say yes to everything. Yes Ma'am, how much ice? Who's the last in line? Mr Gantz. -I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. The bank won't run away. Did you want to buy a lottery? Mr Gantz! Kid, what are you doing here? -Mr Gantz! Look at me! Look at me! Is it... is it true... Is it true that you're... -Max. Go home, your mother is very angry. "The man turned and looked at the boy, "and ran towards him suppressing a groan "and into the father's arms fell the boy. "'My Chichelo', cried the father "after having observed thoroughly the patient's face." Lift me up, Mr. Oshrov. Baldy! Baldy! You're no good and your mother's crazy! What are you doing? Are you crazy? You're hurting me, stop it! -Let her go! You're crazy! Be careful, you're killing her. Stop it! Stop it! mummy! Aviya, you forgot something. What happened? You were beaten up, right? No, I stumbled and fell down. Don't worry about the laundry. It's only sand, we'll rinse it. It'll dry during the night. In the morning I'll iron it in no time. You're a big girl now, you're 1 0, next week's your birsday. What's next week? -Your birsday. We'll have such a nice birthday, you'll see. Everyone'll come. -Come where? To your birsday party. -Birthday party, Mom! Well, what did I say? We'll have such a birthday party, the whole neighborhood will come. You'll see what your mother can do. Eitan, Are you coming? -ln a minute. Such swines! You invite people to a birthday party and no one shows up. No, sit up. Don't wrinkle your new dress. They'll come, you'll see. Let's see what it is. What a cake! -Those sweets! Look at the napkins! Where is that woman? Come girls, come on in. It's Aviya's birthday party now. The birthday is inside, not out here. Come in, congratulate Aviya. Here, such nice fellows. Come in, it's Aviya's birthday party. Come on in, it's nice. A birthday with cake and sweets. Look, Aviya, some fellows came to your birthday party. Come on, Aviya, look how many kids... came to your birthday party. Here is the nice Altman family. Mr. Altman, Mrs. Altman, come in. It's Aviya's birthday now. Everyone is here, come inside, It's now. Please, just to drink something. Look, Aviya, everyone came. Well, what do you say? What... Really, what a putzkale... So tiny, what a pretty tiny baby. Such a tiny beauty... came to Aviya's birthday party. It's not a girl, it's a boy. -A boy? This woman is crazy! Aviya, why are you so gloomy? Smile! It's fun now. Now let's make a real birthday party. Everyone, please, get up and lift Aviya ten times, and one more for next year. Where are you going? -Mom, don't! Everyone, please, together... One... -Mom, you don't lift a ten year old. I'm big now. -Four... five... I was ten years old, I celebrated my birthday, but since then, I never wanted birthdays again. Never! Mom! Thank you! It was a wonderful birthday party. You're an exceptional girl, Aviya. What's exceptional? You're a good girl. You're also exceptional, Maya. Aviya, can you keep a secret? -Cross my heart. After the summer I'm leaving home. I've decided to rent a flat in town, and start taking ballet seriously with Gertrud Kraus. She's the best in the country. Does your mother know about it? No, she doesn't. Anyway, I'm twenty already, and I told you it's a secret. She'll probably make a big fuss. Well, it's tough on her, you know, raising a child all by herself, without a father in the house. -But I've got a father. I do. You've got what? But promise to keep it a secret. Do you want a blood oath? No, Maya, I trust you. Something wonderful has happened. My mother thought that my father died... and my father thought that my mother died. But no. They didn't. They're both alive. I told Maya that my father was alive, and was living here with his new family. That he was waiting for the right time to come back to us. I don't know whether she believed me, But she asked... "Are you saying that he's living here in this village? " Do you mean here in this village? -yes, and you even know him. Should I tell you? It's Masha's father. Maya, I have to go. -Wait a minute. Friends? -Friends. Look, it's grown already, by the end of the summer you'll be pretty. Don't ever let me see you here. There's a limit to everything. Carrots, onions, radishes. It's good to have a garden. Saves us a lot of money on vegetables. But you'll have to take care of it, when I'm in boarding school. Why boarding school? Stay with me. Can l? -Yes, you can, you can. If you can bear this summer with me, you can face anything. I'm not letting you go away from here. Tomorrow I'm going to register you at the village school. -Mom! Hi! -Hi! Well, of course, I knew you'd be here. Another cup of tea or lemonade? Mrs. Henya, may I ask a big favor from you? -Yes. I have to take Alter To the New lmmigrants' Hostel and... if you could come with us it could do him good. -Yes, sure. No problem, I'll just go and change. Sorry you had to wait, we were waiting for the lady. Maya, come here a minute. I'm coming. I told you. The three of them felt miserable. Alter was quiet as usual, Mr. Gantz apologized a lot, and mother showed understanding, saying: Immigrants Hostel isn't so bad, and only I was happy with the trip. I was riding in a taxi for the first time, with my mother and Mr. Gantz by my side. See you, Alter. Is he from Dad's side or Mom's? He's from his side. What does your Dad do? He works in a bank. -lt shows. Let's go somewhere else. Go where? We're going home. No, let's go to the beach. We're not going to the beach, we're going home. I've got work to do. Next time. This ride wasn't for fun. No, fun is at a ball. Are you coming to Abramson's ball? Do come. People need some fun in life. Come, we'll dance together. Just a minute, Maya. Your attention please. Tonight, I'm happy to announce that right after the holidays we'll be opening here in the basement Maya Abramson's Dance Studio. The first one in this village. Registration will be held right here. They are waltzing. -What's a waltz? It's... a beautiful dance, and your father, he knew how to waltz. When he danced, everyone stopped... to make room and to watch him. He was such a dancer. Once we won a first prize in a dancing competition. Too bad Abramson didn't invite you. You could have shown them a real waltz. Me? No... He would have shown them. To waltz, you need a good partner. Without him... I don't dance anymore. How do you dance this waltz? One, two, three... See? We're having fun too. A real ball, right? We've got music, dancing, and everyone is happy. Such eyes, Miss Maya. To think that they were in danger. Your eyes, I can't believe it. He had exactly the same ones, Such big, black eyes. Stop, Mom, I can't anymore. Stop! My head! Mom, stop! The music stopped, Mom, the dance is over. There's no more waltz. I hadn't noticed. They'll start again and we'll dance. Enough, Mom, go to sleep, it's late. No, no, you go to sleep, l... I can't sleep on such a night. It's so hot, you can go out of your mind. I wish this summer would end. What a crazy summer. Mom! Mr. Gantz, you promised me a dance. No, a waltz. -Waltz. Mrs Henya, I was taught that people who are uninvited don't come. But Mrs. Abramson... -Mr Gantz... Stay out of it! Since you came here... we've had nothing but trouble. -Trouble? I thought he was an honest and dignified man, but it turns out that he isn't so. You can't hide such things. What things? What're you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. Tell me, is it true? Leave me alone! What was that supposed to be? What kind of stories have you made up about your mother and me? Do you know what you have done? We are people, a family... You're a bad girl! My friend, Maya Abramson. For years I didn't mention her name. She was a girl I threw a stone at... one summer... when I was a little girl. Excuse me, Mrs. Henya, I don't understand, your husband? Is he alive? What? -Your husband... is he alive? My husband... was killed in the war... in the woods of Poland, 1 941. Two weeks later, the Gantz's packed... and left. They had hardly been here... and now they were immigrating to Australia. Mrs. Henya, I hope you understand, Mrs. Henya, it's a difficult country, and... we haven't had any luck. Maybe over there... and the sun here, a lot of sun... Too much sun here. Watch over your mother, kid, she's a wonderful woman. Look at the dust they've made. About time they built a road here. Summer was nearly over. The days grew shorter. And an ominous feeling hung about in the air. No, close it. Come on, I told you to close it. No. Close the window. Close the window. I've got a headache, such a headache. Take this. -I don't want to, it doesn't help me. Take it! -lt doesn't help me. There's a train whistling in my head. Have a good weekend, Mrs Henya. Why not take your kid to the beach? No, it's too crowded on a Saturday. Another time. -There is no other time. Summer is over and winter is coming. We can take her with us. She Should enjoy every minute. -No. My girl is sensitive. Too many people make her nervous. She's got a nerve, that woman. Telling me what to do with my girl. What does this Cohen woman care if we go to the beach or not. What's a beach? Just sand and dirt, that's all. Just another place to catch diseases. I don't want to see her face. I don't want to see anybody. Some things, you can't ignore. I'm waiting here for this Cohen. until she comes back from her beach and then she'll hear from me. Everybody will hear from me. Some things, you can't ignore. Everyone should live their lives, and not interfrey in other peoples'. Mom, no one's interfering in your life. No one is interfering. Drink this. -Don't you talk back to your mother. You're as impudent as everyone else. -Mom, I'm begging you, stop shouting. Don't shout. You're not to talk back to your mother. Close the windows so they won't hear... how impudent you are to your mother. Mom, stop. -Stop what? Don't shout! -There's a train in my head... A train in my head! it's whistling in my head... My head hurts, It hurts all the time. Aviya, the pills! Where are my pills? Dr. Angel! The dogs! Dr. Angel! The dogs! Someone please come out. The dogs! Rexy, Humi, quiet! What's the matter, kid? It's Henya, my mother. It's happening again. Hurry. She needs you. It's urgent. Henya? Which Henya? Henya the Partisan? -Yes, the Partisan. I'm coming right away. Doctor, good thing you came, she's... Give me the key, O.K? She's shouting inside. Kids, I've asked you to go. Go on, go home. I'll open the door for you. She's locked up inside. Please come in. Kid, your mother is very sick. We'll have to hospitalize her. You see, Mom, you feel much better already. You'll get well, and we'll travel by... a taxi. We'll have such a nice time together. We'll go and visit Alter. He's so lonely there in the Hostel. Just don't worry, Mom. We'll have such a nice time together. Aviva, don't worry. I'm taking your mother to the hospital. I called your aunt, she'll come over. If you want to, you can stay with us in the meantime. Aviya, it's me, Maya. Aviya, please open the door. I know you're in there. Aviya, please open up. I have to talk to you. Why didn't you eat? Eat up, you need strength. Your father... if he could see you... Let's not talk about it, Aunt Alice. My father is dead. It's O.K, I'll manage on my own. Wait. It's only for a while, it's only for the time being, only until your mother gets well. That year Mother didn't come to visit. not even once.
