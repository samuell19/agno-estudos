Can you take another one with Bahar and I? Sure. Selma! Come here. Hurry up. Try to look tired. Like this? Bahar! Bend a little. Like Quasimodo! Exactly. Cüneyt, you look like an old usurer. Take off your glasses. That's better! Smile for the camera. Here we go. And it's done. Should we take another one together? There, ask them to take it. Hey! Hey! Yes, you! Come here! Come here! Moron. Doesn't even know what he's looking at. Three people died as a result of a sudden flood in Çaycuma... Your old region? No. I was stationed at Gerede. But it was raining so much there as well. We had so many floods. Fortunately you did not stay long. About a year and a half, right? Two years. Then Posof, and from there, Hekimhan... We lived in Uhut before that. No. That was earlier. Your son was born there, right? No, he was born in Hekimhan. Are you happy with his new private school? We are, but he does not care about school. He is obsessed with that shitty video game... and he plays it all day like an imbecile! I changed his class. We'll see how that works out. He will succeed, don't worry. He still has time. He has to. He doesn't have a choice. You can go ahead too, if you want. No. I prefer to go after the tea. It's clean, at least? It's not too bad... It stinks. These pillows have been tickling me since this morning. Rıfat will take care of your transfer. Don't you worry about that. Assuming all goes well on your end. Rest assured! I don't need to tell Cüneyt. "MY ONLY HOPE IS IN YOUTH." K. ATATÜRK PAVE THE WAY TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE BY PAYING YOUR TAXES IF YOU DON'T ASK FOR A RECEIPT YOU ENRICH OUR ENEMIES Don't smile, you're sleeping. Open your mouth a little. Don't exaggerate, you're not at the dentist. You remember Ahmet, who works at the Ministry of Agriculture? Who is that? You know, I used to buy marinated mushrooms from him. Oh yes, it was disgusting. Was it called Nuröz? No, I think it was Akçay. A shortie. Like a dwarf. With a mustache. They were also waiting for a child. So? They got one. They applied before us, right? No. Just a few months before. How do you know? I have my sources. Not the district directorate of national education. They should deal with the provincial directorate of national education. No, no. They should talk with Mrs. Leman who works there. No, not the 18th. It's not possible. The students will be in Akseki. For the folk dance championship. Yes. Of course. See what you can do... and call me back. Yes. Okay. What's up, Cücü? Nothing special. Same old. - Still these folk dances? - Don't ask. It's just boring. I don't want to disturb you. I just wanted some time off this afternoon. - I only have one class. - Of course. Nothing's wrong, I hope? No, I have to take care of some things for Bahar. With women, it never stops! That's for sure. - Sir... - Get out! It's OK. Is that a new tie? Where did you buy it? It was Bahar who bought it. I have exact same one. The other day, we took the car with my wife to Alanya. Do you know the shopping center on the way back? They have season-end discounts now. Beautiful looking ties, very cheap. I bought the one I'm wearing there. I love the color. 8 bucks for 3 ties. 10 bucks, if you buy a package of 6. Sounds like a great deal. It was 8 bucks a tie before the discount. It really is a good deal. Yes? No, I said it was Mrs. Leman! Don't you have a pen? Yes. Did you write it? Mrs. Leman. How the hell are you? Me? I'm doing fine. What about you? The wife, the children? Good to know. Listen. I called you for the car wash in Muratpaşa. That's it, İzzet. I went there the other day. They closed it down. Do you know their new address? Great. Text me their new address. No, don't call. Send a text message. I went there the other day. They busted the hood... while cleaning the car. Sons of bitches. Who says that? Nevermind. Bye. He is a veteran of the Korean War and a retiree. He came to ask me for a job for his daughter-in-law. Didn't he come in last week too? He did. These veterans are stubborn. He boasted of having pushed the Communists back to Imjin. I told him, "Bastard! Go back to Seoul..." "and see if Geun-Hye gives work to your daughter-in-law." Well said, Mr. Director. You get rid of one, another comes back. There's no running away from them. Hüseyin! Take care of these geese. They are shitting everywhere. - Of course. - We have visitors here. - I'll take care of it right now! - Okay. Thank you. Mr. Cüneyt? Hello. - Cemal Serbest, the director. - My wife, Bahar. - Welcome. - Thank you. Let's go to my office. Follow me. Cafer, bring us three teas. What can I do for you? Mr. Director, we are the Bahtiyaroğlu family. The agency told us to come today. Welcome. We were told we were going to see a baby for adoption. Let's see what God has in store for you. God willing. Do you prefer a girl or a boy? We would prefer a boy. Unfortunately, it's a girl. But in very good health. And that's not always the case... with the children we are entrusted with. But this baby is... as fit as a fiddle. It's true, health is important as well. As you can imagine, our work is not easy. We are overwhelmed these days. In fact, we are organizing a charity ball next Friday with the Ministry of Commerce and a foundation. There will also be activities for children. We will have a team of 12 clowns that we are currently training. I also ordered giant balloons from Istanbul. With "Poppo" and "Caillou" written on it. Very big balloons. The children are crazy about it. We will also gift the children some toys. - God willing, it's going to be a nice day. - God willing. - Enter. - Good luck with the preparations. Excuse me. What line of work are you both in? I work at the tax office. I am a history teacher at a high school. It must be in our file. I have a question for you, now that you're here. My eldest daughter, Özge, is in high school. She is going to take the college entrance exam this year. And we want to send her to a college-preparatory school for this semester. But we hesitate between two schools, Success and Leader. Which one do you think is the best? I have friends who teach at Leader. They are better in social sciences. Success isn't a bad school, but if I were you... I would choose Leader. That's also what we were told. Even her teacher recommended it to us. But there is an annual difference of 75-100 dollars between the two. Do you think it's worth paying such a difference? - It's up to you. Mr. Cemal... Excuse me. Cafer! Take it by the legs! My God. I am really sorry for this incident. We raise them for children. To teach them to love animals. I am sorry. Excuse us. - You're welcome. - I apologize profusely. It's just that... What a story, my God! She appeared suddenly. Anyway. So, do you think it's worth it... to pay the difference? If your daughter studies hard, she will succeed anywhere. Right, as long as she wants it. Our baby is 65-70 days old. Her name is Zehra. You can change her name once you proceed with the adoption. Here she is. I have to go to the laundry. I let you spend a little time with her. Thank you. I do not like her. Neither do I. She is not for us. She looks like a Syrian baby. More like Kurdish. It will not work. She is too typical. And ugly. Too masculine. She doesn't even look like a girl. She's no good. Her nose and ears are somewhat similar to uncle Necati's, but no. We have seen enough. So? Did you like it, our little girl? Unfortunately, we could not have a social connection with this baby. Sorry? We'd like to try our luck with another baby. Of course, that is your right. But as you know, you only get to see three candidates. I advise you to think about it before making a final decision. You will have to wait a long time before seeing another baby. We know. But we will wait for another one. Don't worry. We have your details. If something comes up I will call you personally. Thank you. And if I have a question about my daughter's school, I may be disturbing you. Please, don't hesitate. I'd love to help in anyway I can. Thank you. - Have a good day. - God bless you. Goodbye. "No social connection"? Assholes. 1179... We support our candidate! Please. We support our candidate! You have the right, but that was not your argument. - Yes, exactly. - No! - He's got 80 votes. - That was not your argument. Just a second! We support our candidate. You're spreading misinformation. - Not at all. - Yes, misinformation. Stop lying. Sir! You are older than me, don't be disrespectful. Liar! Stay respectful. We know very well who has been lying for the past 13 years. What Kurdish problem? You can't avoid criticism by defending the Kurdish party. I'm just saying you're a liar. If you're legitimizing a terrorist organization, then you're the liar. - Excuse me? - And you call me a liar? Can't you hear me?! I'm telling you that we support our candidate! It's not the only thing you said. No it is! - We support our candidate! - It's a lie. We've all voted for him! We have to take a break. Maybe a break is what we need to calm this heated discussion. We all need to take it easy. We will continue discussing this issue in a civilized way after the break. Stay with us. Lens - Sochaux, under. Sheffield United - Doncaster Rovers, home win. Viborg - Aalborg, away win. Atlético Nacional - Boyacá Chicó, home win. Niort - Clermont, draw in the first half. Metz - Nimes, home win with a handicap. What do you think? Remove the match from those coke dealers. Are you crazy? I got that for sure. Hammarby - AIK, 2 goals for each side, OK? I'm not sure. Take the bet. The last time you made me lose my bet. How could I know that the match was rigged? Austria Lustenau - Kapfenberg... between 4 and 6 goals. St. Pölten - FC Liefering, home win. Ajaccio - Auxerre, under. Kashima Antlers - Urawa Reds, home win. Degerfors - Brommapojkarna, under. And what are the odds for that match? I heard that Degerfors has a lot of injured players. Real Salt Lake - Santa Tecla, home win. Did you say Santa Claus? Santa Tecla. A team from El Salvador. Hello. Hey, hi. What about you? I'm listening. A boy? One second, I writing it down. Yes. Yes. Yes, of course. Thank you so much. I will keep you posted. Have a good day. My god, change station. It's too boring. Why don't you change it yourself? It will work this time. I dreamed of a beetroot. Beet? Yes, beetroot. I thought that was the symbol of money. If you eat it, yes. If it falls on your foot, it's fertility. On your foot? I saw my aunt-in-law in the dream. I open the door and she is there. - My aunt-in-law? - No, mine. I say hello, I kiss her. Then I notice that she has beetroot on her foot. I tell her that she has it on her feet. She says no, she does not. And then, I woke up. It has to mean fertility. We'll see, then. God willing. I told you to turn right. That road leads to Isparta. He must know. Ask him. Hello, sir. Hello. We are looking for the orphanage. Are you a doctor? No, I'm not. I was told it was next to the stadium. Yes. Near the train station. Where is the station? To the right. Turn right. Thank you. If he has a guardian, there must be a court judgment that proves it. He has a guardian or not? I said a guardian. A guardian! It also requires a certificate from the Regional Health Agency. He must check the percentiles first. Exactly. Fine. I have visitors, I'm hanging up. - Hello. - Hello. - We are a little overwhelmed, my apologies. - No problem. We are the Bahtiyaroğlu family. I am Cüneyt and this is my wife Bahar. It's Mr. Cemal, from Antalya, who sent us. Of course, I was waiting for you. Mr. Cemal is an extraordinary director. Yes, he helped us a lot. How was the road? Did they repair it? We drove without any problems. Çeltikçi road is terrible. There was gravel everywhere. It was horrible. Is that so? We didn't notice anything. Mr. Cüneyt... did you say your family name was Bahtiyaroğlu? Yes, that's right. I know an İsmail Bahtiyaroğlu who lives here. He makes uniforms for the army. Is he a relative of yours? No, I don't know him. Not even a distant relative? No, really not. You look a little like him. He is bald like you. If you want... I can show you the baby right away. Yes, please. I am sure you have been waiting for a long time. Yes. We have been waiting for two and a half years. That's not such a long time for Antalya. Is the waiting list shorter here? Yes, in comparison. I wonder why. The main reason is the number of inhabitants. Also, women here are more fertile. It may be due to the climate. May we see the baby? I'll show it to you myself. Please. How old is he? I'm not sure. About 30-40 days, I believe. Perhaps less. Is he a boy? Yes. A boy. He's the one! Cüneyt! How cute! He weighed only 7 pounds when he arrived. His blood type is A+. And we call him Ali for now. May God protect him. Cüneyt, look at his hands! The dream opportunity! - Can we take him in our arms? - Of course! Come. Cüneyt! Look at how handsome he is! Yes, the perfect opportunity. You can come in! It's ridiculous. Really. Stop making me laugh, Coşkun. Coşkun... take one with me in it too. I press the right key, right? Yes. Long press. Wait. One more. Coşkun, get over there so I can take one with in it you too. With me? Of course. Do not look at me, look at the baby. It looks like he's more light skinned than yours. Wouldn't that be a problem? It will be fine. If they ask, I'll say he had jaundice when he was born. Good idea. Excuse me! Yes? Nurse, come in. Yes, doctor? Come, sit next to me. Congratulations. - God bless him. - Thank you. You have found the right one. He's a cutie, the little bastard. Yes, he is just as we wanted. So, have you planned the moving? We are going by plane first. For the furniture... we've arranged a mover. We're almost done with packing. Was it expensive? It wasn't cheap. Good thing you were able to transfer out so quickly. It's all thanks to Rıfat. It isn't always easy to do. As you know. There are some who wait for years. Rıfat works in the ministry, so... I hope everything will be fine. The hardest part is behind you. Try to be optimistic! How long does it take to adopt the child officially? Six months? No, a year. That's a long time. Longer than I would've thought. Austria and Niš... Banat and the mountains of Transylvania have become borders. The prince of Ardeal, François Il Rákóczi was released, on the condition of maintaining peace on the border of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, we reconquered the territories ceded to the Venetians. The peninsula of Mora, the islands around Corinth... three ports in Crete... and Ayia Mavri. Sino, you brought the map of the Ottoman Decline. Go get me that of the Stagnation! Go! Go! And shut the door! - Hi, how are you? - It's okay. And how's my son? I could hardly put him to sleep. Did you manage to make him eat anything, at least? Yes. He had an appetite today. God be praised. Why is the heating so low? Be quiet! I don't know. It's been like that since we came back. Did you warn that idiot of a janitor? No. I'll call him, that fucker. I'll go downstairs to check up on him. Fine, fuck off. Has he ever been sick? No. He's been healthy. Don't take him out too much, it's still cold in Kayseri. We only take him out with the car. And you, have you ever been sick? No. Cüneyt had a small flu but it lasted only a couple of days. We need a medical certificate, even if the baby hasn't been sick. We'll have it for you the next time. I assume you have a good relationship with the child. - I can wake him up, if you want. - I'll go get him. Don't bother. These are just formalities. Do you know if the biological parents of the child are alive? They died in a car accident. Perfect! At least you don't have to worry about them. We have problems with a mother who wants to get her child back. You can't imagine the headache. If it's God's will... The husband is in jail. Ten months have passed... Now she wants to get the baby back. The husband went mad when he heard the news of the adoption. So, it's better that they are dead. You are right. I have a hell of a diarrhea, Saadet! - No kidding! - It's horrible. At least, your intestines will be cleansed. Yes, but it's been three days. That's a long time. - I hope it's not the tapeworm. - The solitary worm? Yes, the worm with hooks. They cause terrible diarrhea. - A worm... - Does it bleed? - A little. - It must be the tapeworm, then! Oh my God! I should boil some milk and sit on it, perhaps? Do you know what they say? The milk attracts them. I sit on a pan? You're laughing, but it's dangerous. It's been three days already and it's bleeding? Go see a doctor! What should I do? Shit in a box and bring it to the doctor? To keep white teeth, think about using bicarbonate... Saadet! You have to go up another floor. Ah... we got out on the wrong floor! Come. Please. Enter, welcome. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. That's nice of you, you shouldn't have. It's nothing. Come in. Make yourselves at home. Welcome. It's a pleasure to have you here! - How are you? - Good, thanks. And you? I can't complain. - God bless you. - You too. I weighed 123 pounds before my pregnancy. I became huge. Oh please. You look fine. You will lose them, your pounds. How much do you weigh anyway, 150? 160? No. Around 146, 147. I went up to 160, if you can believe it? Your daughter Pınar must be 5 years old now. Right? Yes. She is in her 6th year. What month was she born? 4th of February. And the boy? 22nd of March. So you were pregnant... during the winter. Tell me about it. Especially while waiting for Pınar, we had a huge snowstorm. The Yozgat road was cut off. I couldn't get a foot out the door for 3-4 days. The heat has its challenges too. It was unbearable for me between the 4th and the 7th. It was so hot. That's the reason you didn't gain any weight. The heat. I couldn't even turn on the AC. Thought I might get sick. I spent the whole time in front of a fan. Poor girl. How long did you work? For about 6 months. I had to work for 7 months. But my doctor did not want me to. You should have stopped earlier. I got a fake medical certificate... because there was a so-called risk of miscarriage after the 4th month. Do you want to see my pregnancy photos? Don't bother. Let me take a look at the baby. Look at those eyelashes! He's so cute! Bahar. He doesn't look like Cüneyt at all. He looks like you. He took the ears of his father. His nose and his eyes, it's me. No, look. His mouth too, it's you. His mouth is like my brother's. He also has a crooked mouth. What a cutie! You have a crooked mouth, my sweetie. Do you? Look at how beautiful he is! Did you knit his sweater? No, I bought it. Look what I found the other day! Isn't that a little big? Little sailor! Little sailor! I went to Donetsk in '97. At the time, no one knew this team. Kiev Dynamo used to be a good team. Shevchenko had not yet been transferred to AC Milan. There was Rebrov too. He went to Fenerbahçe afterwards. But he messed up. Where did he go next? Ah yes! To West Ham. The stadium they used to have... was worse than a stable. They were lucky to be bought by this king of coal. But it must be nice there, right? Nice, my ass! My balls were frozen for two months straight! Dude, the winter over there... Kayseri is as hot as Mecca in comparison. I swear, these guys are subhuman! It is misery and poverty everywhere. They don't even have curtains on their windows, you know? What can you expect from these barbarians? There is war there, right? Who the fuck knows. Fucking idiot! He should have passed it to that negro. These empty headed assholes! Fucking assholes! You call yourself a player? Imbecile! I'm going to lose my bet because of this dickweed! Cüneyt, what's going on? Cüneyt! What is happening? You saw someone? Be careful! Your name. It's Cumhur, right? It's Cüneyt. Pardon me! I'm exhausted. The rate of housing loans has exploded! I can not think of anything else. - What do you do? - I'm a history teacher at a high school. - Which one? - Fevzi Çakmak. My son graduated from there. Although it's been a few years. That's good... I have just been transferred. My son is a wanker... but it's a good high school. It is true that we are well equipped in comparison. And teachers have experience. Can I offer you something to drink? Tea, perhaps? Mineral water, if possible. Bekir, Bekir! Oski? Oski, is that you? Are you sleeping or what? Bring us a tea and a mineral water. A light tea! Chief, Ekrem is going to sign with Samsunspor. He can fuck the right off! He's nothing but a conman! These assholes get paid by doing jackshit. He says he's injured. Tell me. How can a footballer be unavailable for 4 months because of a simple edema? Edema, my ass! If they were paid for the match, there wouldn't be a problem to begin with. Nothing will change as long as the clubs pay them 3 years in advance. Especially foreign players! Here, take one. Thank you. Recently... we played against a retirement home. To cheer them up. Some of them played better than these foreign players. That's true. Do you play football often? We are trying organize one game a week between cops. And then, we have tournaments with different institutions. The other day, we had a game with the National Education. We fucked them in the ass by 8 to 2. I scored 2 of them myself. Chief, I thought one of them was an own goal? Go fuck yourself! The ball did not change course. It barely grazed his foot. If that is the case, the goal belongs to the chief. You see, even the teacher agrees with me! She's still not dead, your mother-in-law? Not yet, chief. There's nothing you wouldn't do for that piece of land, is there? - I will buy a house for my retirement, chief. - Yeah, you wish. With these interest rates, you couldn't buy a tent. Anyway, Mr. Cumhur. I was told the story... but I want to hear it from you. Of course. It happened like this. We came back from the mall. It was around 4 P.M. - In the afternoon? - Yes. Our apartment is on the 11th floor. I opened the door and heard noises. - The door was already open? - No. I opened it. There were noises. So I went in. I first thought about my wife's jewelry. That's smart. Money doesn't grow on trees. Yes. When I entered the apartment, he had already fallen. I saw the body and I called you. You're lucky to have missed it. All the thugs hang out in these parts. We catch them. They all come from the same region. But they release them immediately. Laws are just too lax. So, some of them come back. What was his name? This son of a bitch... I lost count of the times we caught him! There is Asparagus, too! We must have caught him 12 or 13 times. And Asparagus, 9 times at least. The laws are not strict enough? Yes. But they are more and more of these thugs. Even locks and steel doors can't stop them. On the other hand, there are fewer pickpockets... because the laws are more strict now. They don't have the balls to do it anymore. Scumbags. If it was the 2nd or the 3rd floor, okay. I can understand. But the 11th? Unbelievable. Fortunately he didn't try to attack you. There wasn't any fight, right? No. I couldn't even get close to him. He had already fallen when I looked out the window. Still, you're very lucky. Did he fall on his head? Yes. His head was all over the place. He was in a pool of blood. It's only fair, he ended up paying. He only harvested what he sowed. Where does this smell come from? The baby? He soiled his pants. What else can he do, we've been here for hours. You could change it. I'll do it at home. He doesn't stink that much. I missed my soap opera. Too bad. What a shame. But it was a crucial episode. Please. I'll fuck them all, he and his family! Is it all good, chief? Can we leave? Unfortunately, no. Don't be alarmed but you are going to have to be our guest for the night. What? Why? Nothing important. You were the last ones to see him. The procedure requires us to keep you under custody until the result of the autopsy. As soon as we get the results... you can go home. There's nothing to worry about. But I depend on section 657. I have the school tomorrow. You know I'm innocent of this. The law is the law. Our police station is comfortable. - Please make it easy for us. - This is a travesty! Calm down. I'm calm! It's good, I said nothing. Fine, what else can we do. - Will you send my wife and kid home? - Of course. - When will he come out? - 72 hours max. But I can't imagine him staying more than a day. You won't hold me for 3 days, I hope? Do not worry, you will surely be released tomorrow. Cüneyt! In Germany, in the 70s, women were driving bulldozers. They worked harder than men. Imagine the mines of Gelsenkirchen. Women worked as hard as men. A sausage... and a beer in hand. You wouldn't dare giving them the stink-eye. It seems that was not the case in Pfortzheim. I was told the women there were beautiful. I went there two or three times. Driving bulldozers... it is not easy. No, not easy. Hello. Sorry for the wait. The connection is slow. No problem. We got these junk repaired just last month. Always with the same shit. Your ID number. Is it 66356234190? One moment. Would you repeat that again? 66356234190? That's right. It seems that you owe the Antalya Water and Sewerage Administration 6 dollars. - Don't forget to pay it. - I thought we had paid it. It's not up to me. That's what I see on the screen. That must be the bill for the last month. My mistress. Read and sign, please. Looks like you're adopting. Congratulations. Yes. Do you see that on your screen, too? We see everything on the screen. I see you found the baby in Burdur. My brother-in-law used to work there... at the sugar factory. We had visited them. It's a beautiful place. You're in luck. Yes, it's a beautiful place. What did they give you to eat at the station? Dry beans, rice, and yoghurt. It was good. We should install an alarm immediately. Forget it, they're worthless. They are the ones who send the burglars. What do you mean, "forget it"? They always come back a second time. Maybe. If he were still alive. He didn't even come through the door. We only have to put bars on the windows. Good idea. But we still need an alarm. What's up with you today? You snapped at the maid for nothing, too. They found out about the adoption. Maybe everyone knows it. - Fucking idiot! Did you tell them? - Why would I tell them? How do they know, then? It's in our file! - Everyone will know then! - Exactly! We should talk to your brother. We must leave as soon as he gets our name. Anywhere. It will not happen right away. It will take months. What should we do? My brother will be furious. So, he got angry? Big time. He was mad at you too. What did he say about the transfer? He said it can't be done this year. But he may be able to get me a job at a private school if I resign. - Where? - In Chad. Chad? What will we do in Erzurum? It is too cold out there. What are you talking about. I said "Chad". In which province? It is a country. In Africa. In Africa? What are going to do amongst cannibals? What cannibals? They don't exist anymore. He says it's the best solution if you want it to remain secret. There's Djibouti too, but it's politically shaky. What about elsewhere abroad? Is it not possible? As if they're waiting for us in London and Paris. But what are we going to do in Africa? We must think. We can not stay here. It's too risky. Mrs. Emine called. She wanted to know about the burglary. You see! Everything is known here. What did you tell her? What do you want me to say? I told her what happened. How long do we have to decide? Until the 20th.
