SABINE KLEIST, AGED 7... When you say goodbye to your Edith today, you are bound to feel a little bit sad. She managed to put up with you for four long years. She gave you all of her love. Mrs. Marloch, who has been with you for a week now, will take over your group. She is an experienced teacher, a former nursery school teacher, principal of a big nursery school. She also has a degree and has raised four children of her own. And now for a farewell to Edith on behalf of the group. Sabine will say a few words. Leave me alone. I don't want to! I'm not mad at you, Sabi. I think I even understand you. I do still love you. Just give us five more minutes. Five minutes! -That's special treatment! -Sabine always gets that. Woman to woman, okay? I have a husband. And a baby growing in my tummy. It's going to be born soon. It's going to need me. And my love. It's knocking already. Listen. You mustn't hate it. Let go of me. 1 go along with my lantern And my lantern goes along with me Up there the stars are shining Down here shining are we My candle is dead it's time for bed Rabimmel rabammel rabumm My candle is dead it's time for bed Rabimmel rabammel rabumm Rabimmel rabammel rabumm My candle is dead it's time for bed Rabimmel rabammel rabumm I do still love you. Sabine! Sabine! Bine! Sabine! Sabine! Sabine! Sabine! -Hey! -Man, put the light out, will you? Sabine! Sabine Kleist, aged seven. Her parents were killed. An accident. Relatives? Grandpa. Nursing home. -And the address of this Edith... -Scheibler. -Edith Scheibler. -1054, 28 Christinenstrasse. But Sabine won't have gone there. Not after what happened between those two. She's probably wearing a pale dress. Striped. And her white jacket isn't in her closet. -Do you have a picture of her? -Yes, we have a picture. We have pictures of them all. Look. How sweet. Kurt, give the little one to me. She'll catch a cold out there. Where did you come from? You're Rita's girl, aren't you? Men! They have no common sense at all. It was worth a shot. Good night. We'll be in touch if she does happen to turn up. Put the coat away and go lie down. Edith. Think about our own little one. I can't yet. I have to learn how first. Come here. Thank you. Bye. Leave it. I'm pretty good, aren't I? So what? You're just sore. Are you new here? -What's your name? -Sabine. Can't you speak any louder? Nope. I'm Rita's daughter. So what? Do you even know who Rita is? She's the only woman who can do a triple. In the whole world. You're impressed, right? Nope. My mom... my mom can fly a real-life airplane. Way up high. Silly billy! No one does that in a circus. Of course not in a circus. Way up in the clouds. With real people in it and all. -That's great. -My mom can even ride a bicycle. Mine can too. She can drive her Citroen and Uncle Dirk's Volvo. Well mine can even drive a... tractor. And she sometimes drives a fire truck. -How much does she earn for it? -99 hundred thousand marks. Now you're talking crazy. No, I'm not. I'm not talking crazy at all. Mommy's always there when I want her. She talks to me about everything. And she laughs too. Know what else she does? What else? Impressed, aren't you? It's like Santa's sack. Did he hear any of it? -Who? -The man in the coffin. It was a woman, and she can't hear anything anymore. Hello. So who were you playing for then? Who for? Do you want a piece of candy? I don't want any. Okay, let me do this. That's just what you do. The music. But why do you do that? Honor to whom honor is due. What does that mean, "honor, honor is due?" Well, for example, if you haven't just lived your life for yourself. Or if you've won a medal. Or maybe even two. Or if a lot of people know you. Uh-huh. What do you mean, "uh-huh"? Then no one will play any music for me when I die. That's up to you. -Do you think so? -Yes. Did you know the woman in the coffin? No. But you still played music anyway. Time for you to get back to your mommy. She'll be looking for you. But what if I don't have a mommy? Grandma! MATERNITY WARD CHILDREN UNDER 14 NOT ALLOWED -It's a boy, wow! -They called me three hours ago. It's a boy! Know what you're getting yet? We'll see. Yeah, you can tell. I got a sister this morning. So what? She's going to sleep in my room. Two people in one room. There's six of us in my room. -Six? -Yeah. -Six kids in one room? -Yeah. That's crazy talk. Come on in. Six? Can't see straight, can you? Do you know an Edith? -Is that your mommy? -She's my friend. Go and ask the nurse. Right. Let's go shall we, Mrs. Merker? Cross your fingers for me? Come on, mommykins. I saw my sister. She looks really great. Visiting hours are over, people. It's feeding time. Come up here, you. Isn't that the sweetest little boy? You must love him very much. You must love little ones very much. Just look at her little face. What a cutie! She looks like you, doesn't she, your sister? Just like your mommy and daddy love you, you have to love your little sister. Hey, let me down. Isn't your baby hungry? Or don't you have one? Are grown-ups even allowed to cry? You can have me. I do still love you. Hey, what are you doing? Can you ring the Scheibler's bell? I'll give you a piece of chalk if you will. I'll do it without the chalk. Ripening time has now begun Let us see what's in our field We came beneath the bright May sun Does the corn smell of bread Or just the money it will yield? Are the ears laden with corn Or just husky and foriorn? Can I have 50 pfennigs? Sorry, you can put money in but you can't take it out. Yesterday They were still the young ones... Do you have 50 pfennigs I could have? And they planned such bold deeds And saw how many came to pass How many of the small green seeds Will we preserve with the harvest? How many have been taken by frost Withered and to the hail lost? Ripening time has now begun Let us see what's in our field We came beneath the bright May sun Does the corn smell of bread Or just the money it will yield? Are the ears laden with corn Or just husky and foriorn? Pick one. I can't do that. Yes, you can. There, see? Empty your pockets out. What about the cookies you had in the cart? I can pay for them. I'll give you them free. That's 45, please. Thank you. You get some change. Are you hungry? There you go. I didn't even like them anyways. Are you on your own? I'm on my own too. Maybe you need a sister. It's possible. Come on, now. Don't start crying again. It's okay, take it easy. Friendship, drushba. Come on. Boy... has lost mommy. I understand. Child not Russian. A Polish boy. Understand? Say something, will you? Stanislaw. Stassik. Stani. Sabine. Sabine. Sabi. Sabi! Sabi! Stani! Shall we splash him, over there? Him, over there. You little devils! You're getting your pants all dirty. I could learn to speak Polish. Don't you think? Then you wouldn't be so alone. Stani. DESK SERGEANT If I go in there, my goodness. What else? I found him. I can speak a little Russian but he's... a foreigner. A.. -A Polish friend. -So a Polish comrade, right? -You found him on Alexanderplatz? -Yeah. He's called Stani. But I have to go now. Don't you cry any more. Hey, wait a minute! Stay here. Aren't you the Kiesler kid from 12 Rigaer Strasse? From 20 Rigaer Strasse. -Want to hear something funny? -Sure. Shoot.
