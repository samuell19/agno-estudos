LOVE CRIME He looked like a turkey! A turkey with a green tie. You're pretty when you laugh. Like a little girl. A drink perhaps? With pleasure. - We're stopping? - A break. We deserve it, don't we? That's good. We just need a killer idea to clinch the deal. You leave tomorrow. We still have time. If we can't think of one, I'll improvise. You smell good... What's your perfume? I don't wear any. Not all the time. Not tonight. You should. Relax, Isa. Your shoulders are knotted. Can I call you Isa? No, actually. Isabelle suits you better. I know a masseur who works magic. I'll give you his number. - Bordeaux? - That's fine. I run at the gym. On a treadmill. Running blanks everything out. I forget myself. It's beautiful here. Everything's beautiful. A touch obsessive? A little. Conscientious, intelligent, precise. Precious. We make a good team. I'm pleased. I'm pleased, too. Your scarf's gorgeous. It's yours. No, Christine. I can't accept it. Of course you can. Don't be silly. It's perfect on you. It smells of you. To us! If you like... To us! Why do you need to forget yourself? You don't have to answer. Back to work? Two busy little bees. Am I interrupting? I'll come back later if you want. Evening, Isabelle. Good evening, Philippe. Don't worry, I'll finish it later. I have all night. The front door's locked. Do you mind going out the back? No. OK, see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Philippe. Daniel? This is Isabelle. Sorry to call so late. I'm prepping Christine's Cairo meeting and I had an idea that could seal the deal. Remember last year, how we won the Philippines soda contract by bringing in local subcontractors? Morning, ma'am. Morning, Jacques. This weekend? No, bad timing. I have a meeting in Cairo. Promises, promises. Leave it with me. I'll call you back. I found the man for the job. The go-to guy for a dozen food industry subcontractors. Daniel, it'll work. He's a political big wheel. Christine can contact him. I won't tell her, so she finds out on the plane. Great idea. You've gift-wrapped it for her again. Gift-wrapped it? It won't be the first contract she wins thanks to you. Her, me, same difference. And a complete list of anyone skimming some off. That's a long list. Precisely. Time to clean up. What? What's scaring you? - Excuse me... - Hi, Isabelle, come in. We're done. Puffy eyes. Get any sleep? A bit. Our proposal. I finished it last night. I think it flies. You can read it on the plane. No. Why not? You're going to Cairo. You know the brief. You'll do a great job. Honestly? Honestly. Thanks, Christine. Thank you. You just have time to pack. Wait! You should do something with your hair. Let's see it down. Keep it up. You're perfect. Hurry, you'll miss your flight. Philippe's at the airport. I asked him to go with you. His firm worked on this and he knows Cairo. CAIRO - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thanks very much. Good job! Involving the local subcontractors... Smart move. - Christine's idea? - No, mine. It occurred to me last night after... I planned to surprise her. I'd better call Christine. Now it's a done deal. We can fly out tomorrow morning. Why tomorrow? Don't you deserve a day off? Cairo's a beautiful city. OK. We'll stay on. Well? When does our tour start? Right now! You planned to surprise me, didn't you? You're shocked? Me claiming your idea as my own. You'd have done the same. At least I hope so. Want it and watch out. At all times. I wanted New York, but I couldn't count on it. Thanks to you, I'll grab my chance. Grab your chance. Haven't you heard of that? It's not a betrayal. It's teamwork. I believe in you. You have real talent. I made the most of it. Thanks. So, how was Cairo? Beautiful, eh? And with Philippe... Even more beautiful? I heard about Washington and Cairo. Sorry, it's plain wrong. What's "wrong"? Christine fast-tracked to the top, thanks to you. So what? It's great. Good teamwork means we all win. I succeed if she does. We complement each other perfectly. Here... Take a look. It the market research the Americans asked for. A new grain-based food product. Real potential. It could take off. Christine doesn't need to know. Not yet, at least. I'm abducting you. Pick you up in five minutes. Yes, Christine. Fine. I bet you were a secretive little girl. I don't know. Maybe. Of course. Like you are now. A real little sphinx. You know, I can read sphinxes' minds. And what do you see? You didn't like yourself much. I wanted to be loved. I wanted to be admired. It's now I want to be loved. There's a lipstick in my purse. Try it. It'll highlight your eyes. Perfect. So? Beautiful, aren't we? Come on. I'll teach you to work a room. It's not your strong point. But it's very useful. No, the worst is Siberia. Unbelievable! You remember Siberia? Yes. That stuff about a shaman in Siberia, it isn't true? Never been there. Too cold! And that fat guy listening with his mouth gaping like a dead fish. 800 employees. 600 million in turnover. The kind of fish I like. I'll call him next week. Your turn now. - My turn? - See that guy? Bald, nose in his glass. That's no fish, that's a shark. He's bored stupid. Reel him in. I don't know how. I'm not like you, I can't make up stories. And I've been drinking. Good. Ask him about himself. Men love that. Quick touch-up. Perfect. - Surprise! - Jacques! Can't get enough of each other. Awesome! Same again next weekend? My helicopter's ready when you are. My chopper and all that comes with it. No Cairo chore to get out of? How about Corsica? What? No little trooper to send into battle? Just a second. I'll be going. I have a headache. You're way off. It's not that. It's not what? You think that Cairo was because it suited me. You're wrong. I sent you to take my place because I trust you. What I got up to doesn't matter. What does that change? Stay. I feel woozy. I'll call a cab. Go ahead. No kiss? Did Christine ever come to yours? Ever come here? Are you sure you want to talk about her? What's it like with her? It turns you on. You surprise me. What's it like? She thinks only of herself. In bed, too. She knows. You told her? Cut it out! Forget Christine. She wanted it. You can't get enough. Not with you. What's she like when you make her come? I think that's about it. Any questions? Isabelle? I got a memo from head office. Market research that Washington sent. You have it? It's a pretty vague project so far, on the back burner. Keep me in the loop. Of course. That's all. Thank you, everyone. Do you have a minute? Yes. My scarf suits you. I'm glad to see you wearing it. You're mad at me about Cairo. - No. - You are. You're mad at me. And I can't stand it. I love you, Isabelle. I really love you. And you? Me too. You know that. No, I don't know that. You think I never have doubts? I need to be told, I need to hear it. I opened up to you in the car. I never told anyone that. I shouldn't have. You see? You can't bring yourself to tell me, I love you. I love you, Christine. Come in, Philippe. You asked for me. Here I am. You're both very complicated. Back to business then. Leave us, please. I need a word with Philippe. So... How do you intend to make amends for your financial chicanery? I told you. Give me 2-3 months to balance up and everything's fine again. You have one week, max. You're insane! That's impossible. I said I'd cover you for a limited period. Time's running out. Washington's sniffing around. I refuse to be exposed. Hold on... My firm's worked for you for so long, where's the trust? I prepared an annex, dated today. I'll add it to the report. You can read it if you want to. I need to protect myself. If anyone reads this, I'm dead. Pay it back and I tear it up. Don't do this to me. You think I'm stupid. Philippe, I need to see you... You know I have a mole in Washington. Yes, and? He told me the new product will be okayed next week. If we start work, discreetly, we'll be ready for the green light. This time, Washington will know who did what. We'll see. ...before you go. Call me. Isa. Send. Fuck it! You didn't get my text? Of course I did. But this isn't a good time. A good time for what? I have problems. Big problems. Tell me. I'm here. I can help you. Listen... We've got to stop. Stop what? Us. You and me. Stop. It's best. Is it Christine? - She wants us to stop? - It's not Christine. I don't believe you. I'm sure it's Christine. - Tell me... - You don't get it! She doesn't care about us! Get it? She doesn't give a damn! We don't exist for her. You don't! I don't! This new product has great potential. I've had some ideas. I'm sure you have. I did the last checks. It'll be in Washington when they arrive. 48 hours before Christine's activity report. Well done, darling, it's great. You know my taste. It's not too noisy? You're sure? How much again? New York's so expensive. I'll take it. Happy? Sure, I'm happy. Over there, it's only 3:00pm. Give them time to read it. First set... to us! They basically like it, want to test our sources and move very, very fast. It's all good. Daniel? Yes? The report... I can't not mention it to Christine. Before it's too late. You know what she'll do. Same as always. Look... That's how it is. I can't change it. I'll tell her tomorrow. Pity. Christine Riviere's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. Why, Isabelle? You were in the loop. You never asked about it. It all went so fast. I was going to tell you today. I called you last night. They beat me to it. Answer my question. Why? Why what? "Want it and watch out." I listened to you. I observed you. I learned to act like you. You learned nothing. You don't get it. You've ruined everything. You ruined everything. There we are. The answer to my question. Yes? It's me. You were right. It's Christine. She forced me to break up. She forced you? Yes, forced. She frightens me. I'm not ashamed to admit it. She enjoys playing with you, destroying you. She did it with me. You too now. I want to see you, Isa. I need you. I want to be with you. If you want me. I don't know. I don't know if I do. I need you. To love you. Tonight? I'll pick you up if you want. Late. Around 8:00pm. OK? Isa? OK. Tonight at 8:00. Here. No, it's not Philippe. It's me. The woman who plays with you, destroys you. Nice line, huh? I have to say, with you it's easy. Poor Isabelle, all dressed up, I bet. Only wants to be loved. Perfume tonight? Just a bit too much. Go home now. What happens now is up to you. Nobody's irreplaceable. Thursday at 8:00. That should be fine. Next week, I'm in Germany. - With Bertrand? - Yes, Bertrand. Meeting the Czechs. - When are you back? - Wednesday evening. What a little trooper! Sorry to interrupt. I've noticed something weird. Looking through the files of an operation earlier this year, I saw a massive difference between the actual budget and Philippe Deschamps' firm's estimate. Maybe it's just an accounting ploy. What's weird is that Christine just added an annex, a kind of ultimatum, covering herself against Philippe. Are you OK? You get the message? Christine's organised a party for all senior execs. Saturday night. Yes, I know, but it'll look bad not to be there. My friends! We've prepared a surprise. For your amusement, I hope. A quick documentary. A life lesson, if you like. The theme is: Executives and their toys - heartbreak and pleasure. Here we see the executive trying to save the toy. A proper little Good Samaritan. Before joining the firm, you wanted to be a doctor? Yes. I read it in your file. The marital crisis. We've all been there. Just forgive and forget. Isabelle talks to the lift. Isabelle doesn't like her parking. Isabelle tries to out-scream her alarm. Isabelle argues with a concrete pillar. You can't win every time. Know your limits. It's just a laugh. Show us your sense of humour. Like the others. Isabelle the tragic heroine. I see why you need to forget yourself. Stick to the treadmill. The real Isabelle is in that car park. The other one doesn't exist. It was just a bad act. She had me fooled a moment, but I was wrong. Get over it. You were born that way. Hurry, Christine brought forward the Monday heads-up. It's started. Coming. I need a word. Take a seat. I'll never forget what you did. I'll make you pay one way or another. I didn't write this. It came from your computer? I didn't write it. After your reaction on Saturday evening, who else would write such grotesque threats? I didn't write it, and that's it. The first lapse, the first slip-up in your work, and I will use it to fire you. Got it? Go on. This is Isabelle Guérin. Could I speak to Dr Fabre, please? Pierre? This is Isabelle. Can I come by? I'll be right there. Daniel? The file you mentioned with Philippe Deschamps' budget estimate... - Do you still have it? - Yes. Thanks. Here... Don't archive it just yet. Hold onto it. Sure. Christine wants you. For the Japanese deal. They want a souvenir photo with our two top execs. You know what they're like. Tell her I'm coming. What are you doing? Taking the train? Where's your car? At the mechanics. This is stupid, it's pouring. I'll drop you at the office. Look... One day, I'll explain. I know it was unforgivable. But I was in a bind. You have no idea. Did I leave my scarf at yours? No, I'd have seen it. I must have lost it. Shit. - She's popping pills now? - Yeah. And that stuff's poison. I thought she was tough but... You remember her predecessor? Elena? Do you know where she wound up? Mental hospital. Nervous breakdown. My place, Saturday. A dozen of us, no more. I look forward to it. Hi, sweetie. Hey, sis. That was fast. Barely 90 minutes. Your hair looks good. Claudine, I missed you. It's great to see you, the house and everything. You're so heavy! I'm top of the class in French and Art. Why don't you ever visit? Your aunt works even harder than you. Come on in. You're a real kitty-cat. Do you purr? Denis is at work? He gets home soon. Can you wait for dinner? Sure. I have plenty of time. Really? Something's going on? In my car, on the backseat, there's a big parcel. Can you get it? Quickly! Upstairs? She's a wonderful little girl. I like picturing her here, in my room. It feels so good. Are you happy with Denis? I'm very happy. What about you? Same old. Always ends badly. Last time was the worst. So embarrassing. I could have died. I've messed up. I mess up every time. A nice little husband... a nice little girl... a nice little life... Maybe I'm not cut out for it. Sorry... I didn't mean it like that. Do you love me? Of course I love you. All three of us love you. Tell me. What's wrong? No money, please. You give us enough already. It's not that. Can you do something for me? But you have to swear never to tell anyone. Ever. You asking me for help for once... I swear. - I told you, the Americans... - Bullshit! That's not it. All clean and tidy. If that's all... That's great, Eliane. Thank you. Goodnight. See you Monday. No more, OK! - Cut the crap! - Enough! Daniel? I don't feel well. I won't be in today. Why? What do they want? Really? Is it serious? I'll be in touch later. I need to get some sleep. Don't call me. Miss Isabelle Guérin? Yes. May I? Yes. - Are you OK? - No. I just took some sleeping pills. I haven't slept. You know Christine Riviere has been killed? Stabbed three times. Her house, Saturday night. I didn't know. You weren't on good terms, I believe. Work issues. And there was a party last week... Why aren't you at work today? I don't feel well. I'm sleeping badly. Serious shit! You take many of these? Right now, yes. You have to come with us. - Why? - Please. Get dressed. We'll help you. Thank you. These threats came from your computer. Your relationship with the victim was very tense. Recently, she completely humiliated you in public. Didn't she? The victim managed to write "Isa" with her own blood. Earlier, you seemed to be hiding scratches on your arm. Lastly, she was clutching a scrap of fabric that seems to be from an identical scarf to the one you're wearing here. Now, I have a question for you. A very important question. Listen and think carefully before replying. Where were you Saturday night between 11:00pm and half past midnight? At the movies. Alone? Yes. Anybody see you? Recognise you? Why would anyone recognise me? Sometimes you talk to people and they remember later. Remember what? Meeting you. Then you have an alibi. You couldn't have killed Christine Riviere. Killed Christine? No... I met no one. I talked to no one. You didn't keep your ticket? No. What for? I'll call the boss. I won't be long. Don't go to sleep. Try to keep a clear head. Mind you, with all you take, uppers and downers... ...hell of a cocktail! I need them. You might have a problem there. If you need them. The boss has made his decision. As of today, 5:30pm, you're in custody. You'll be notified of your rights in due course. If you have a lawyer, it's time to make a call. I can't sleep. Isabelle Guérin! There are the scratches on your arm. And tests prove the scrap of fabric... ...comes from your scarf. Therefore, I confirm you're under arrest and will be held in custody. It'll be OK. Miss... You must be intelligent, given your qualifications and position in your company. You knew you'd be the prime suspect, the most likely culprit. Shall we take a break? You need a doctor? I agree. My client... Sorry? No? We'll go fast then. By staging the crime scene to accuse a supposed prowler, you aggravated your crime through cold premeditation. I recommend you confess immediately. It'll save us all a lot of trouble. - My client is not in a... - Miss Guérin. Did you kill Christine Riviere? Was it you? I think so. Careful. Think what you're saying. What do you mean? You "think so"? Do you confess? That's right, I confess. Will they leave me alone now? I don't feel well. First, sign your statement and confession. I must emphasise that my client's... Your client has confessed her crime. Her confession goes in the file. My medication... Can I have my medication now? Go ahead. Young woman suspected of murdering her boss Miss, do you recognise this person? Perfectly. She wanted a carving knife. She was so nasty, I can't forget her. It's rarely as bad as she was. Show me your carving knives. Good morning. Don't get smart. I'm a customer, not your friend. No good. I want a knife with a black handle and a blade like that. A good knife. Do yourjob, will you? There! That one. If you'd listened, you wouldn't have wasted my time. Miss Guérin? Did you buy this knife? - You don't have to answer. - Counsel! Your client has confessed. We're beyond all that. Yes, I bought a knife, but... I'm listening. You admit you bought this knife. The knife that became the murder weapon. We're done here. Thank you, Miss, that's all. My pleasure, sir. Any time. You shouldn't have come. I love you, Isabelle. I can understand anything, but this... I'm sorry. I love you, too. Don't forget what I asked. That's all you have to do. Nothing else. What is it? I want to see my lawyer. It wasn't me. I didn't kill Christine. - You retract? - Yes. I'm innocent of all charges. Why did you confess? I don't know. Overmedicated. I wanted it all to stop. I was so tired. It all seemed so strange. And now it's not so strange? I'm off the sedatives now. In prison, I realised what was happening to me. I'll ask them to see you. I feel much better now. Yes, I know, I have a scarf like that. I think I lost it somewhere. I didn't really look at home. We searched your house and found nothing. You're generally very tidy, but you "think" you lost it? Allow me to doubt that. You could have got rid of it when you saw it was torn and pointed to your guilt. I lose things, like everybody else. You need to look harder. You could undertake another search. My client has no reason to lie. She has a scarf like that, or she doesn't. Well? Nothing. And the knife? I did buy a knife like that, but I broke it next day. I forgot what I did with it. Sure. After searching all day, the police found no trace of the knife Isabelle Guérin claims to have broken, which could have helped prove that she didn't... It wasn't me. Why would I do a thing like that? You alone have a motive. A powerful motive. Revenge. I've seen how far humiliation drives people. I never wrote that email! Why would I do something so horrible if I'd written that? I'd have been nuts. Christine sent it to herself, from my computer. My career was taking off. She resented it. She was at war with me. A war of attrition. Hatred. We have statements from witnesses who all confirm that my client was shaken by her boss's harassment. She was depressed, taking a lot of pills. That proves nothing. Just the opposite, in fact. Nothing you say is supported by the evidence. It points to you, but you're innocent? I remain convinced of your guilt. - What is it? - Somebody, help me. Help me. What's going on? Calm down. Breathe in. Slowly, deeply. That's right, like that. Breathe in. Breathe out. That's right, like that. Again, keep going! I can't do it! It's too hard. I thought... I thought that... It's too hard. I can't do it. What can't you do? What exactly? I can't cope. With prison. It's too hard. I can't do it. You can. You wanted to see me? Yes. I know it wasn't you. I never thought it was. I'm scared. The whole time. I'm scared. I needed to... see someone I love. I forgive you. I don't want any enemies, see? Thanks for coming. There's something else. I knew about your issues with Christine. The file, the annex. Her ultimatum. I planned to use it to get back at you. Pick it up. It's in Daniel's office. Isabelle gave me this letter for you. She can't trust anyone else. Be careful. Daniel... Nobody will believe me. I need you. You know I trust you. I have a favour to ask. Don't feel obligated. It's your call. Never seen her before. Thanks. Ask the ticket clerk. OK. Do you know this woman? Yes. I remember her very well. One forDernier Rivage, please. Sorry, I'm out of cash. You'll take a card? Sure, no problem. - Sweet? - Thanks. Move it, will you? Sorry. Sweet? Thanks. Here it is. Playing the cop, huh? I just never thought she was guilty. How did you know where to go? She'd mentioned the film. The theatre was easy to find. We'll see if it checks out. Maybe we didn't look everywhere. She was so obviously guilty. On top of that, she confessed. She took me through the whole movie. She watched it from start to finish, at half past midnight. She couldn't have been at Christine Riviere's. If she has an alibi, keep digging. Is it a good movie? Apparently. I haven't seen it yet. Thanks. Why "Isa"? Maybe she really believed I'd stabbed her. She hated me so much. Yes, I know. You all noticed them. We never discussed them. You assumed they proved she put up a fight. It only occurred to me later... She was perched shakily on a chair. Just about there. And then? Then nothing. Except, before tending to her arm, she stowed the chair in the shed. She's an extremely tidy person. - Borderline obsessive. - Yes, indeed. I'll take a look next door. Goodbye. All I know is, she's a good neighbour. You OK? Are you hurt? I'm fine. I'll just disinfect it. It's obvious my client was wrongly accused. A confirmed alibi, no conclusive evidence, no DNA at the scene... There are still grey areas. The scarf, for example. You still claim you lost an identical scarf? That's right. It was exactly the same. If we find it, it'll be intact. Might I make a request? Go ahead. Would you allow my client to go with your officers to look for the scarf herself? Granted. I give you three hours. But that's the last request. The scarf means freedom. It can't have just vanished. How long left? A half-hour. What? Intact. No tears. I'll take this one. Isabelle Guérin was released today. An example of the ideal suspect falling victim to a series of wicked coincidences. Beware of evidence that doesn't stand up to inspection and motives that are too good to be true. It was almost another miscarriage ofjustice, but this time the lead investigator displayed great humanity. He conducted the case impeccably. The case shows once again that confessions can be dangerous. They are never proof of guilt. Let's hope officers, who all too often look for an easy conviction, will learn the lesson. Sources suggest the investigators' new leads include a prowler or acquaintance of the victim. Morning, Miss Guérin. Miss Isabelle Guérin? Speaking. This is Jean Druon, your company banker. What can I do for you? It's a bit awkward. A serious matter. I just received, by anonymous mail, details of dealings between Christine Riviere and a law firm. And? We're currently checking, but it looks like a certain Philippe Deschamps tried to conceal funds siphoned off from one deal. - How much? - I'm not sure exactly. The accounts were tampered with. Approximately 80 million euros. I see. Complete your investigation and keep me informed. Call a meeting for tomorrow morning. Everybody? All our executives. And those of our affiliates, including senior staff at our legal advisors. That includes Philippe Deschamps? Yes. I know what I owe you. Thanks. You'd have done the same for me. I'm sure of that. Beautiful, aren't we? I'm really happy for you. And thanks for that file. What file? Morning, everybody. Thanks for coming in. The aim of this meeting... Yes? What do you want? Excuse me, can I have a word? Go ahead. - Right here? - Yes. Hurry up. The police are here. Crime and Fraud squads. Do you know why? They're here to arrest someone. - Someone in this room? - Yes. Show them in. Gentlemen... - Philippe Deschamps? - Yes. Come with us, please. I'll fly to Washington this week to set out my new strategy. I'd like to outline it for you, so we all know where we're going. You will be charged with the murder of Christine Riviere. What? We'll do pre-emptive searches on your vehicle, then at your home. This is insane! Don't worry, all will be explained. Torn. Did I leave my scarf at yours? I must have lost it. I thought as much... You tried to throw suspicion on to Isabelle Guérin. Even writing "Isa" in blood! One look earlier and I knew. It was Isabelle! - Don't start that again. - This scrap of fabric is bullshit! Why'd I leave it at the scene, if hers was intact? You were the only person who knew she'd lost it. You took advantage. Trouble is, she never loses anything. - Take him in. - Let go of me! All the party guests agree, Deschamps stayed behind with the victim. In the file sent to your bank, we found an ultimatum from her. He was bound to be exposed as a crook. Your assistant confirmed Deschamps collected the file in person. When we checked your archives, the annex had of course disappeared. He denies everything. The exact opposite of you. Human beings are so complicated. Sir, will you allow my client to leave Paris for a few days for an important meeting in Washington? Granted. I owe you that much. You owe me nothing at all, sir. You were doing your job. I'm grateful that you listened to me. Despite everything. Despite myself, even. Thirsty? Strong stuff. Serious poison. But you know they're safe. And so are you. For now. I always admired you. That strung-out wreck of a woman wasn't you. I had my doubts. I got the pill analysed. A placebo. Sugar pills. A great pretence. Like all the rest. Confess and prove your innocence. Smart. That was you. The real you. You'll never be like her. She was capable of killing. But not for love. Flight at 8:00. Shall I wake you? Goodnight. Sleep well.
