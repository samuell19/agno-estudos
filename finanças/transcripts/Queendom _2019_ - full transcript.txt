Wow! So pretty! Hello! [With fluttering hearts,] [the unit members gather at Hongcheon-gun, Gangown Province.] [For the first round of the third competition, "Position Unit Battle".] [They part ways with their original members.] [The members must form new units.] The dance units don't have the freedom to choose their own songs. Please, don't come. [The lower ranks get pushed out.] [The dance unit team's selection site.] [LOONA gets pushed out twice.] I'm going to get first place even if it's out of anger. [Dance unit team selection complete.] [The vocal unit's situation is similar.] (onscreen) [Grab the partner you want!] Are you going? I'm sorry. A couple has been formed! [Steal and obtain!] (onscreen) [Vocal team selection complete.] We will begin the mid-evaluation of the first round of the third competition. [Preview of the vocal unit.] [The three teams form a sweet harmony.] The first place of the vocal unit's mid-evaluation is? The theme of the first round of the third competition is, "Position unit battle". [Position Unit Battle] [A touching performance that plucks at the heartstrings.] [is newly created through the vocal unit.] [The dance unit is equipped with powerful performances.] [An overpowering performance that entrances all.] [Starts now!] [Along with the Queens' budding friendship,] [the worskshop's atmosphere also ripens.] Until now, you've all had to bury your Queenship. Queenship... ? We will unveil them now. But, there is something that needs to be done beforehand. In Queendom 2, the relationships between the sunbaes and hubaes are a bit ambiguous. VIVIZ acts like they're rookies. - Right? - Well, it's not exactly an act... So! We will conduct a "Seek the hidden ranks of the Queens." "Seek the hidden ranks"? If you look at Queendom 2's debut rank, Hyolyn debuted in 2010. It's been 13 years since Hyolyn debuted as SISTAR and has become a major sunbaenim. In Queendome 2, Hyolyn's rank falls at fourth place. - What? Why? - Fourth place? The major sunbaenim has appeared. The same 13 years since debut as Hyolyn. The third place goes to a Kep1er member. [How could there be a third place amidst the baby queens?] [What is her identity?] Third place is, Yeseo! [18 year old Yeseo sunbaenim gets shy.] Her eyes are so big and pretty! She's such a baby! At the time, that was a 2010 drama called, "Golden Fish." Oh, my! It was May 3, 2010, when she starred in the episode. So you can say she's Hyolyn's one month sunbae. One month? Kep1er's Yeseo is third place for ranking queen. Let's take a look at second place. Does that mean there's an even younger child actress? In 2007, with 16 years of experience, she's a sunbae. The second place is... this person! - Who is that? - She's so pretty! Third place, Yeseo? Who do you think it is? Eunha sunbaenim? - Oh, VIVIZ's Eunha? - Yes! What about you, Brave Girls? Umji? Umji? I think... it's Kep1er's Yujin. Oh? Kepl1er's Yujin. She looks similar! It looks like she took the picture yesterday. Oh, you're right! Oh! That must be her! - Eunha! - Yes? Who do you think it is? - It's the first encounter for me. - Oh, really? Yes. I can't tell who it is. The sunbae who debuted in 2007, with 16 years on her belt is... [Rank Queen second place, who are you?] VIVIZ, Eunha! She was the antagonist in the drama "Love and War." What do you mean antagonist! I was the child actress, Love and War's child actress! Yes, not the antagonist. - It's too difficult to be an antagonist at that age. - That's right. All my fans know, but I didn't realize it'd become a public debate like this. I'm so shy. Queendom 2's rank of second place goes to VIVIZ's Eunha. Now, for the first place. This person debuted earlier than SNSD's Taeyeon who debuted in 2006. Did she debut as soon as she was born? Was it a diaper ad? - Diaper model. - Long Johns model. Milk formula model. [What is the identity of the first place?] [Her picture is revealed.] She's so cute! - So cute! - Who is it? [There's someone here who can't lift her face.] Who is it? [Shy] The child in this picture is Kep1er's Dayeon. Her face is there. This was 2006 KBS drama, "Famous Chil Princesses." - I know this. - I watched it too. Do you remember this? No, I was four years old. [A fancy experience for a four year old.] I was the daughter of Haejin Park and Taeran Lee. There's a picture of me being held by him. Okay, then Dayeon will say a word to her hubaes. An encouragement for everyone who's working hard late into the night. You're all doing so well on this cold day, and let's fighting! I'm sorry. [Rank Queen: First place - Dayeon; Second place - Eunha; Third place - Yeseo.] We conducted a secret research beforehand. We looked for Queen of the Queens, Queen's Pick. - Hello. - Hello! Hello. Visual queen. We can only choose one person? I want to recruit her to our team. She needs to get along with our members. [The queens contemplate.] [Who is the visual queen and recruit queen?] I will announce the results of the visual queen, who was directly voted by all 37 girl group members. Let's see! Let's see! - Who did you choose? - It's a secret! I'll announce third place first. This is like Miss Korea's top finalists, Jin-Seon-Mi. Jin-Seon-Mi. She's a member of Kep1er. Kepler's Yeseo. Her bunny teeth are so cute and her eyes are so round. She's so cute! I think, Kep1er's Yujin. Unni has a very beautiful smile. It's my beloved Xiaoting unni. She's a very convincing beauty. I get shocked every time I Iook at her. Visual queen, third place is Kep1er's Xiaoting. Thank you. You're so pretty! Our team has a really pretty Xiaoting. Our Ting unni is very pretty. [It looks like she's drinking dew.] [She's pretty even when tearing into jelly.] [She makes low resolution into HD.] Her proportions are outstanding as well. She has big eyes too, so she has this aura when she opens her eyes. She looks so good with red hair and her eyes are really pretty. I chose her as visual queen. She's the best in my heart. Thank you so much for voting for me. - So pretty! - So pretty! - So pretty! - So pretty! Everyone is pretty! Okay, I will now announce second place. WJSN's Luda explains her reason for choosing this person for second place. She's pretty. LOONA's JinSoul sunbaenim! She's so pretty! She's like a goddess. LOONA's Olivia Hye. LOONA's Go Won! LOONA's Hyunjin. LOONA's Heejin. Visual queen second place is... LOONA's Heejin. Thank you. I saw her in person and thought she was really pretty. She's so pretty. It's including our team, right? LOONA's representing beauty. She has a high nose bridge and her facial structure is amazing. She's so pretty when eating. She's so refreshing to look at even if you see her every day. [Beauty is the best. Stunning collection of Heejin's side profile.] I'm in awe even though I see her bare face every day. With makeup on, tables are flipped. Her voice is also attractive. She has this boyish voice. I didn't realize I'd be chosen. Thank you for your kind opinion. She looks like a rabbit. Brave Girls Yuna explains why they chose this person as first place. Every time she appears, she's pretty. I think it's Seola sunbaenim. - Yeah, that's right. - Oh, my! It's not me. What are you going to do if it's not me? VIVIZ's SinB, stated that every time she saw this girl on screen, she couldn't make a reaction because her jaw dropped. - Unni! - No! Don't do this! What if it isn't me! Don't do this. Stop it. The food truck lady said that she's so pretty that she got jealous. [She believes this.] And the coffee truck lady, said she's never seen anyone this beautiful in her life. Unni! Unni! Stop it! [Scream] It's not me, right? I need to go home if it's not me. Camera director also said She's so pretty, she puts me in a daze. The moths are also gathering, attracted by her beauty. [He hits their humor chord.] First place is, WJSN, Seola! [WJSN, Seola] She's our unni! Visual Queen is Seola. - Seola sunbaenim. - Seola sunbaenim. I chose Seola unni. I saw her at the first encounter, and she was sitting in the first row. I saw an aura surrounding her. When you view WJSN's performances, [Her visuals steal the show at the start of the performance.] she's so pretty! She's so pretty. I'm at a loss for words. [So she screams instead.] [It's not that she's not pretty offstage.] She has a face that I really like. [She's pretty even when she cries.] Sunbaenim, I love you. She's our unni. Everyone here is all very pretty. Thank you! I'll become more beautiful! Now, then. The gift! What's the gift? For Visual Queen, first place, we will gift Seola, an aura edit throughout the workshop. [The gift encites laughter.] I'm so jealous! It will start now. Look forward. Every camera man, please focus on Seola. [Queendom 2, cameras unite.] Mom! She doesn't need to do her makeup? I'm proud of you! [Please look forward to Seola's visuals.] Finally, while doing Queendom 2, "I'd like to recruit this member." Wow, this is the best one. What would it be like to scout her? You've thought about this before, right? The topic of this Queen's pick is Queendom 2's most coveted, "Recruit Queen." I want her. I want her! I feel like Haseul will be one of them. [Everyone throws their guesses.] [Amidst all the guesses] - Chaeyeon! - I think it's Dayeon. The girl group member that all the other girl group members chose. The reason why you want to recruit her? To be honest, I'm pretty certain. I choose Yeseo. Our average ages aren't that high, but it's not that low either. I love you. Tada! She's a very fun person. And she's good at shows too. [She's a loveable girl who spreads the happy virus.] Unni! We'll go and help you! [Dayoung's insider characteristics make even the shy unni laugh.] She digested the intro to "Wa Da Da" really well. She's good at rapping and dancing. She's perfect at everything. Hold on. How do you write the "bae" in sunbaenim? Sunbaenim... Sunbaenim... I don't know. It's Eunseo. Today, when the dance team was all together, we conversed in Mandarin. So, what are your thoughts? - You can speak Mandarin? - A little. [She spoke in Mandarin for Xiaoting.] I really like her. She was so warmhearted. LOONA's Heejin. Choerry sunbaenim. [The poll booth becomes a site of confessions.] Can't see this. Can't see this. Can't see this. I'm not going to show you. [What are the results of the Recruit Queen poll?] Queendom 2, Recruit Queen. Tied for second place. Two people? The two tied for second place are... [Drum roll] ...both in Kep1er. Chaehyun and Hikaru! [It's like they won first in a music broadcast show.] Daebak, what's going on with our team? - What is this? - What is this? Recruit Queen is Chaehyun. - Chaehyun. - Chaehyun. The timbre of her voice is great. She's really good at singing. She has a timbre that no one in our group has. [LOONA has fallen for Chaehyun's unique timbre.] If I had six bodies, I wish I could be with all of you. Please look after me. [There's one shy person here.] What do I say! Leader unni has called out for her many times. Hikaru! I like you! Unni, you're good now, right? Hikaru is too cute! So cute! She's usually really cute and Fun+Karu. During her performances, I've had my eyes on Hikaru. Thank you! I'm so happy! So cute! I want to put her in my pocket. Look at her aegyo. Now, I'll announce first place. The reasons for why people chose her for first place are amazing. Top all-rounder. Her performance is shocking. I want to learn from her. There's a lot to learn from her. The first place for Recruit Queen is... Recruit Queen, Hyolyn sunbaenim! - Hyolyn sunbaenim! - Hyolyn unni! I chose Hyolyn sunbaenim. Oh, what? For Recruit Queen? Many people truly covet you. I'm so shy. I really want to do a performance with her. She's always doing something remarkable for her performances. [She shows a remarkable performance each time.] I covet her ideas. Even offstage, she's amazing as a person. I've decided to choose sunbaenim. Queendom 2's Recruit Queen is Hyolyn. Yes, thank you. [I chose you-na.] [The brilliant sight of the blooming marbling.] [Highest grade of Korean beef.] We gift you the highest grade of Korean beef. Thank you. Please recruit me. Perhaps, you have someone you wrote down for recruitment? But, I chose an entire team for Recruit Queen. [Sunbaenim, we're LOONA.] I chose VIVIZ. [Automatic standing ovation.] Thank you! Wait a minute, there are exactly four pieces of meat. Three for VIVIZ and one for Hyolyn. We'll grill the meat! Queendom 2, Recruit Queen winner is Hyolyn. Please make a round of applause. [Who is the queen?] [Brave Girls] [Since 2016] [Hyolyn] [Since 2010] [Kep1er] [Since 2022] [LOONA] [Since 2018] [VIVIZ] [Since 2022] [WJSN] [Since 2016] [Run the World.] [Queendom 2] [Oh, this...] Oh, this... is what I wanted to do the most. We need to decide here. Where should I go? Who should I push out? I'm sorry. How cruel. [Ka-boom!, Purr, Desire] [Dance unit selection complete.] [VIVIZ X Kep1er chose "Purr."] [They're now one group, but it's still awkward.] We were nervous and awkward. I needed to muster up the courage to speak to them. Excuse me. VIVIZ sunbaenims, I liked all your performances, but the opening was the best! - Oh, really? - It was a legend. [VIVIZ used their hands for a unique choreography.] We also said that Kep1er did the best. We said, "Kep1er did this the best!" [The silence returns after a relay of compliments.] [Their mouths turn to stone.] We're typical introverts. We can't initiate conversation with others. Dance unit, to do list. To choose the unit name and team catchphrase. But, doesn't Kep1er have a knack for things like this? [Kep1er's signature catchphrase overflows with fighting.] Catch your eye! Catch your mind! [Their cuteness that catches the eye and mind are bonus.] We don't have anything like that. We're all three letters... Cabbage... ? Cabbage? Cabbage sounds nice! - It sounds familiar. - It could mean something. Cabbage. The inside must be comfortable... But, the title of the song is "Purr." Pearl of the night sky. The next stage is, "Purr" of the Night Sky. You like this kind of humor. Can't one of these work? I like "Cabbage." The "Ke" of Kep1er and "VIZ" of VIVIZ. If you do that, Let's use a "1". We can use a "1" and then "Z". KEV1Z. [Unit name, "KEV1Z" finalized.] Now, for the team catchphrase. Should we do an acrostic reading of KEV1Z? - Kep1er, VIVIZ... - Oh? ... are dope. Kep1er and VIVIZ are dope! Right on? Ji dae cap shyon, jjang jjang jjang! [What's ji dae cap shyong... ?] Ji! [We'll check back on KEV1Z's catchphrase.] [Now, it's time to dive into practice.] [They're re-watching the "Purr" choreography.] There's a "meow"! We need to practice our isolation again. I thought it was hip before. But, it feels sexy too. Let's search what the word purr actually means. It's when a cat purrs. Don't they make that sound when they're upset, more than when they're in a good mood? [The cat has become more tough after meeting the girls of Holybang.] There's a king vibe going on. Like a rough, wild cat. Remember during the second competition, Hyolyn's concept was a cat? [Hyolyn expressed herself as a seductive cat woman.] Instead of a wild cat, how about we go for a stray cat concept. I feel like that way, we'll be a little different from Hyolyn's leather concept. Now, everyone, shall we warm up? [Leader SinB leads the warm up.] Let's go! Who catches the choreography well? Xiaoting raised her hand! She raised her hand. [Someone enters the practice room.] - Hello! - Hello! Hello. Thank god! Hello! I came as HolyBang's representative. I'm HertZ. Hello! There was one person who wanted to come with me. I've brought her with me here. [The person in the video that shocked everyone.] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my. Hello! Hello! This is Honey J! I should've gone in person, but I had plans already, so I couldn't partake in this opportunity. But, I do look forward to see which amazing people will continue with me. [We're those amazing people?] I will look forward to our meeting and will see you during our dance practice! Fighting! Thank you! I had so much fun watching "Street Woman Fighters." I'm so glad we can dance to their choreography. Since I saw the choreography, I did think it was similar to Holybang's style. When I found out for sure after watching the video message, I got the chills. We go, "meow." But, the music isn't cute, so you need to be like a scary tiger. Meow and purr. One, two, three, and four. [They try it with the music.] Elbow and left, right, left, right! [The members surprise at HertZ's fancy footwork.] and left foot! [Trips] [Trips] [So focused, Dayeon smacks SinB by accident.] - I'm sorry! - It's okay! [HertZ leads them more energetically.] Let's take a water break. It's hard because the movements are fast, but we also need to fill the beat with so many moves. It's difficult. [The members continue without any sign of exhaustion.] [Focused observation] I'd like a little more hip hop in your moves. Your moves are a bit feminine. I'd like for you to all practice together as if you're female warriors. I hope you win first place. KEV1Z, fighting! But, this feels new to us. I feel like I'm going to cry. We don't really do anything even if we're together. Yeah. This feels different. It's an unimaginable combination, but I also think that we'll manifest an unimaginable energy as well. [Looks forward to the trio's performance.] - Unit name? - Unit name? I'd like something impressionable and witty. Something that just sticks. [What would that be?] Hyo, Yeo... Filial daughter? - Filial daughter. - Filia daughter! [Laughing] Something that just leaves an impression. What would be good? What about something with "X"? EX, as in past. Something with Ex. Ex-it? The thing of the past? - Oh! - Mmm. If you combine it, it's "exit." I like it. [I like it too.] [Unit name is finalized, Ex-it.] What should our team catchphrase be? Something that matches the concept of our song. [The catchphrase utilizes the salute pose.] I think that's a good idea! Dun, dun, dun, dun, exit! [Ex-it's first official greeting.] - Ex-it! - Ex-it! - Wow! We're on top! - Now, to choose the concept of our performance. I want your concepts to change 180 degrees. I'm not saying the two of you should have differing concepts. I want your concepts to change 180 degrees from what you've shown until now. While you're performing as Ex-it. Like, when you're dancing, your expressions, etc. I've been part of a group. I know that the group's color exists. I 'm aware that you can't deny those things. I know that they probably couldn't do exactly what they wanted to do until now. So, I want to them to show sides of them that they've never shown before. Which is why they came out on Queendom 2. I have to go to the vocal team now. - If you could just think about the concept... - We'll brainstorm some ideas. I'll also brainstorm some stuff. - Okay. - Okay! - Come back safely. - Stay with her. - She can stay here. - Wow! A stand. Put her in the middle. Fighting! I'll be back. Ex-it, fighting! What concept should we do? [What is the concept Ex-it will show us?] - Sunbaenim, what concept should we do? - First off, we should... [After the vocal practice, Hyolyn returns to the dance unit.] When you think about it differently, Our image apart from WJSN... I don't want to anything related to military uniforms. - Me too. - I feel like it's too obvious. We've worn a lot of military uniforms. [Every album had them wearing some kind of military uniform.] I've done some looking around and there are things like cowgirls, or... [The door suddenly opens.] - ... around the arms. -Ah! - Hello! - Hello! [Ex-it's choreographer, LACHICA.] [LACHICA is the epitome of K-pop performances.] [LACHICA is assigned the choreography of Ka-boom!] [A standing ovation at the entrance of LACHICA.] Is this the first itme you're viewing our video? How is it? I really like it. When LACHICA sunbaenims came, I was so excited and anticpatory. I enjoyed our time together. Is there a reason you chose this song? We are actually the first and second place teams. Oh! Really? This is the song we chose after pushing out other people. [LOONA is pushed out from Ka-boom!] Sorry. Unni! We're on the same team! The choreography really hooked my attention even though we were only given a short time. Oh, that's a relief. When I heard that the three of you will be doing this song, I never saw Hyolyn do anything like this. Yeah, that's right. I thought this would be novel for all of you. - Shall we practice? - Shall we practice? You guys really don't delay, huh? [Ex-it tries matching the moves to the lyrics.] That's right. Okay. Okay! [They go onward with the power of optimism.] [It's a whirlwind practice with no time to rest.] [Encouragement makes Yeoreum dance.] It's good! Eunseo, when you do this... Who's going to stop me? Who's going to stop me? You're not scary at all. You're like a jester! What a disaster. She only has her height going for her. That's true. Unni, you've seen right through me. This hand motion is pretty, so just throw it. Like you're breaking bricks. Long arms! Okay, I'll do my best. It'll look really cool if you move powerfully. Okay. Your image will look really different. I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. [She hides herself in emabarrassment.] Let's take it from the top. One, two. Yes, yes! Okay! I just realized a flaw. What flaw? Here, here, and here. Why is it like this? [Play the teacher's version.] [Same dance, different feel.] In! In! It's constantly in! All the way here. Wow, my pelvis really hurts. [Why won't my own legs listen to me?] [The practice continues after the corrections.] Okay! Okay! It looks good! It looks good! You're doing really well! I didn't know it's go by this quickly. You made this for us, so we'll win. We can't dull your prestige. We'll make you proud. This is the winning team. I feel like they'll win first place. [First place vibes] [Meanwhile, Brave Girls X LOONA have teamed up.] [They were pushed out from "Purr." [LOONA was also pushed out from "Ka-boom!"] I had conflicting thoughts. I want to win, but can we? With the song we least wanted? Shall we take a look at the video? The full version might be a little different. ["Desire" choreography video, Play.] The song is so good. This could be fun. Wait, I really like this! I like it after watching it the second time. I think it'll be okay. I think we'll look awesome. As long as we can keep it up onstage. I had a lot of worries, but now I'm confident. This was a song that no one wanted. That's right. Won't we look more awesome if we win first place with this song? That's right. I'm suddenly looking forward to this! This is going to be so much fun! My nail broke! - Put a band-aid on it. - Oh no! What do we do? Will we be able to do the mid-evaluation? What do I do? [What happened to these girls?] Should we break down the choreography? We just need to break it down? [Someone walks towards the girls.] I think we need to do that. - Is this doable? - Yeah, or... [Monica enters.] - Ah! - Wow! - Hello! - Welcome! - Hello! - Hello. Oh, you were looking at our demo. Yeah, you're so cool! The concept is pretty one-dimensional in regards to the concept of "Desire." I searched for a concept that anyone could understand. We can properly show something classic. This is a good opportunity to show yourselves off as talented. I love it. When Monica entered the practice room, I felt honored to have the opportunity to learn from her. I was happy, but... Ah! Wait a minute! Ah! The stretching itslef was high difficulty. [The stretching was a catastrophe.] [The room is filled with screams.] [Meanwhile] Wow! [Top student, Brave Girls's Eunji.] Unni, you're like an invertebrate animal. You need to press down on the point of the foot. Oh, my! You're so flexible! [Eldest Eunji is alive to the tip of her toes.] I actually took modern dancing. You're the best. I love it! Love it so much! [Her flexibility enables her to perfect the most difficult moves.] Honestly, I was familiar with a lot of the moves. So, I thought this matched me very well. With cat hands, ceiling on one. Then, bring it down to a cross and take out the opposite hand. [Sweep the floor on their bellies.] [The moves utilize their entire bodies.] Flip it over and show a triangle. The left hand goes in. Then, do a split and bring it into a line. This is so difficult. You've had the chance to memorize it, so I'm going to take a look now. Five, six, seven, eight. [They match the moves to the beat.] Until here. Again. I want each move to look cool. [Monica specifically shows the location of the hands.] [Olivia Hye's hand motion.] [Monica goes over the key points of the dance again.] Okay. From the top. [Once again] Oh, my socks came off. If your body doesn't follow, and it's only your arms moving, it becomes child's play. - Fighting. - Yes, fighting. Five, six, seven, eight! [Olivia Hye misses a beat.] Again. - Wake up. - Okay. Wake up. Shall we drink some water? - Yes. - You look like you're about to faint. - Fighting! - Okay. I'm sorry, but do you know how many years of lessons I've been giving? How many? Over 10 years. Honestly, I can tell just by your eyes, how much determination you have. If you're just starring in the show for the heck of it, then I'm making a big mistake. But, I didn't just come here for the heck of it. Okay. Tense up your bodies. Your concentration is depleted and your body doesn't want to move. - You need to get it together. - Okay. Even while learning from Monica, I think I was denying "Desire." I thought, "How did it come to this?" I couldn't concentrate. Everyone, I have mcuh pride in my occupation. I pouring my sincerity into this. I made this choreography with sincerity. After listening to her, I realized I needed to wake up and get it together. Ready. Don't forget to point your feet. And you must act like a cat! Yes. That's right! What you did just now must work even at a faster beat. Okay. Seven, eight. One! And two! And! Three and a! Again. That's right! Again. One and two. And! You did really well just now. One and two, kick! Hey! Again. Again, again, again. This part is slow. First off, my moves are not that difficult. But, you need to practice. You need to practice a lot. How many times do you usually practice? I don't think I've ever counted how many times. The fact that you can't put a number to it means that you haven't done it that many times before. Practice it 100 times. - Okay? - Yes. - You need to your best. - I'm tearing up. I don't know why. You need to do your utmost best. - Okay? -Yes. Fighting! One, two, three! Fighting! Okay. You did well! Conitnue working! - You did well. - I'm crying too. [Yves starts crying.] I'm crying too. Why am I crying? [Why are they crying?] [She doesn't talk for some time while her emotions overwhelm her.] I haven't felt this way in a long time. Honestly speaking, she could've just left after teaching us the moves. The fact that someone was leading us with such passion. Was there ever a time where my dreams were cultivated? I was able to return to the rookie state of mind. - We can do this! - We can do this! [Memorizing the moves are complete.] [The battle puts the pride of each team on the line.] [The mid-evaluation of the three dance units are?] [The night is filled with the passion of the dance units.] [What performances will unfold?] Now, it's time for the mid-evaluation of the dance units. [Max anticipation] I heard that each unit met some special people. The first up, is Ex-it. Fighting! Manager Song! Manager Song! Manager Song! Don't trip! - I don't remember. - I don't remember anything. Fighting! The first team up for the dance unit's mid-evaluation is Ex-it. I heard that each unit met some special people today. Who did you meet? We met someone from "Street Woman Fighters." The LACHICA team. How much can you show us tonight? We only worked together for 20 minutes, but we have the chemistry of 20 years. That was good! Professionally speaking, one might say you took some roids. Hyolyn, how was it? Working with your hubaes? First off, our chemistry was better than expected. I really like fun things and when the two of us share these fun things, Yeoreum calmly leads us. I think our chemistry is really good. Yeoreum! I like that you're steadfast. Let's give a round of applause for Ex-it's performance. - What if we place last. - I know! What do we do? [Worldwide, first reveal, front row seats.] You can do it! ["Ka-Boom!" - Ex-it] [Perfect synchronization] [Suddenly worshipping Chief Son.] [Check out their perfect chemistry.] [We won't give up the title of Chemistry Queens.] You're killing it! [Chemistry hot spot, Ex-it is open.] [This place has great chemistry.] Thank you. That was insane. The energy was great. They had fun on the stage. It made the audience have fun. It was really great. Next up, we have I'm the Queen. - Let's go. - Fighting! - Fighting! Fighting! - Fighting. You all coordinated your uniforms. Unni Eunji you're so pretty! They're cheering for her instead of us. We have I'm the Queen here. Please introduce yourselves. Two, three. Hello, we're I'm the Queen. So pretty! What did you think after practicing today? Are there any charming points about yourselves? First off, we have someone with a lot of stage experience. - We have our leader, Unni Eunji. - That's right. She said, "Leader Unni." We had some struggles while learning, but she helped us a lot. - Thank you. - She lead us so well, so we had fun. She likes it. She likes it. Can we show you something now? [What's that?] Look at our socks. - We practiced until we got holes in our socks. - She's right. - My finger nail also flew off while dancing. - Aigoo. - My gosh. - This is how hard we practiced. Please be kind even if we make a mistake. [Let's go, I'm the Queen.] All right, we'll check out their performance now. Please give them a big round of applause. Gosh, they must be so nervous. ["I Desire It" - I'm the Queen] The song is so good. The song's great. [They tore it up from the start.] [They split their legs and the stage.] [We desire for I'm the Queen.] [I'm the Queen, tear up the stage!] [The Live Judges are going crazy.] [They throw hot packs as a sign of respect.] [I'm the Queen showed off a shocking performance.] One more time! I could imagine the whole picture. I could see what they'd wear, their mood, and lighting too. Also how people would say, "Gosh, this is such a great twist." "I can't believe they had these sides." I think there will be people who think this way. The last unit is... It's KEV1Z! It's KEV1Z. Please come on out. - Fighting! - Fighting! I want to cry. Fighting! Do a good job. Twerk, Dayeon! Okay. This team is competitive. This team had the hardest choreography. - This team? Hip hop? - Yes. This KEV1Z. Please introduce yourselves. Hi everyone, please yell out the letters for us. - One, two, three. - K! Kep1er. - V! - Viviz. - Z! - Ztay tuned! - KEV1Z! - KEV1Z. That's cute. What is this team's strength or charm? Please give us a comment each. First of all, Sunbaenim SinB is so funny. She loosens up the mood so well. I was so happy practicing together. What about Viviz? Please tell us something nice about Kep1er. I knew they'd dance this very well. I kept watching them while practicing. I felt like I could rely on them. They each have their own unique charms, cuteness, and beauty. I enjoyed practicing with them. Let's see how they melded together. Give them a big round of applause, please. - How do we stand? - How? - Stand here. - I'm not the center. - No, you're the center. - This is the center. Stand here. You are the center. - Oh, Hi-Cen! - Hi-Cen! No, no, no. - She's so cute. - How cute. You're cute, so everything is forgiven. She's right! - She's barely dancing but she's still so good. - Seriously. ["Purr" - KEV1Z.] [Meow] [Big cat charisma has arrived.] [Embraced it perfectly.] [The big cat dominates the world. Feat. KEV1Z.] [So cool] Her expression is so cute. [It's femme fatale time now.] How dare you twerk your butt like that! [This place is a wild scene of excitement.] [So hot] Gosh, I love it. Me and Kim Lip fell head over heels from her butt dance. I fell in love when she was doing the wave during the free dance. The Kep1er members were great at that. They have a lot of talent. Hikaru was such a great dancer. When she was dancing in the center, I was impressed by how amazingly she used her body. She really caught my attention. She undoubtedly felt like the main dancer. All right, the mid-evaluation check is over now. We'll start voting now. They're so good at dancing. Who wants to go vote? Me! - Let's go vote. - Okay. [Time to vote for the dance units!] Everyone did a good job in such a short time. I'm the Queen. The first team was I'm the Queen. I picked KEV1Z. Our KEV1Z team. Of course I have to pick for WJSN. Ex-it. I'm obviously going to favor our team. The dance unit team I chose for the mid-evaluation is... I'm the Queen and KEV1Z. I'm the Queen's performance... truly took over the stage. It was shocking. In the case of KEV1Z, although Kep1er members are very young, I was shocked by how sexy they could dance. It was shocking. Unfortunately, Ex-it... came first in my heart. Okay, bye. [What's the result for the dance units?] All right, the Self-evaluation for the mid-evaluation is over. Before we find out the results, - I'll reveal a special present for this mid-evaluation. - Wow. For the winner of the interim evaluation, they will be given the right to decide the order on the cue sheet. they will be given the right to decide the order on the cue sheet. For real? The order is really critical this time... as there are only three teams. We will announce the number one vocal unit in the interim evaluation. [Girls' emotional harmony, Sun and Moon] [Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe, with a clear voice like the Milky Way.] [Vocal Queens who touched everyone deeply, 33.] The number one vocal unit in the interim evaluation! The number one is... [The best vocal unit selected by Queens is...] The number one is... 33! [As if they won an election (?)] 33, hooray! I knew it! I didn't know that the BOL4's "To My Youth" was so great like that. 33 is worthy of my respect in their vocal abilities. I voted for them because I got goosebumps whenever I heard them sing. I look forward to Hyolyn sunbaenim and Minyoung sunbaenim's vocals. They lived up to their name just as I expected. I loved it. Since I had a reliable and supportive friend next to me. If we practice a lot and sing perfectly at the vocal unit battle, I think we would get a good result... Next, we will announce the result of the dance unit interim evaluation. It was a neck and neck as expected! Then the winner is? [We are the Queen hip-hop Top KEV1Z.] [Ex-it with perfect chemistry.] [I'm the Queen with an unexpected charm that turned up the heat on stage.] [Each team's unique personalities on stage] I have no idea about this one. Who could it be? KEV1Z? I think KEV1Z did a great job. "Ka-Boom" team? I liked "Desire." The number one is... [Who is the number one dance unit?] "Desire" team! "Desire" team! Us? Us? [Congrats!] [This is a festival.] Brave Girls and LOONA were very impressive! It was an amazing performance that dominated the stage. I've never seen that before. It felt new to me. Us? Us? [I can't believe it.] [Neighbors, we won a gold medal!] This is my first time doing something like this. [Congratulations, number one, LOONA] If we practice hard and perform well on stage, I thought that we can expect a good result. Our members won first place for the first time. The winner of the vocal unit is 33! I feel so good! I was really happy! For real. I never said, "We should win first place." during the competition. But this time, I feel a little ambitious. I think we're going to have to win. The interim evaluation is all over. Now is the time to use the winner's benefit, deciding the order on the cue sheet. Now is the time to use the winner's benefit, deciding the order on the cue sheet. Hyolyn unni always gets to decide the order. Tell me about it. First, we will decide the order for the vocal units. This is important. Please. I'd love it if we can go second. We will decide the order for the vocal units on the cue sheet. Okay, the first unit. Please call on the team you'd like to start with for the performances. [Who will perform first?] Let's do this! Who's going first? [Take away the heart sign.] The first one is... Please... The first one is... [You saw my heart, right?] Sun and Moon team. Aigoo! Why did you choose Sun and Moon? When I heard them sing during the interim evaluation, the way they built their harmony... If that type of mood starts off the performances, I thought it would be refreshing. That's why I chose them. - Let's go fighting! - I see. Then now... please call on the second vocal unit. It's us. I think it's us. I think 33 will perform at the end. The second team is... The Universe That Embraced The Milky Way. The Universe That Embraced The Milky Way. It's Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe. - Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe. - Cute! The second unit to go is Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe team. As for the finale, 33 will perform at the end. Please give a round of applause. [Third Competition, First round, Vocal Unit Order: 1. Sun and Moon 2. Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe 3. 33] Let's decide the order of the dance unit cue sheet. Good for them. It's your first time deciding on the cue sheet? Both teams, right? Yes. What's so amazing is that Hyolyn never missed deciding on the cue sheet so far. Right. It's a great record as of now. We always performed according to how Hyolyn sunbaenim decided. [Our name were in someone else's hands.] We couldn't even say in what order we wanted to perform, and we felt like, "Yes, please. Go ahead." - Are we going to decide this? - Yes! - All of these? - Yes! I love it! I found out for the first time how great it is to decide the order on the cue sheet today. I was so happy. Please call on the dance unit that will start off performing. They'll probably go last, right? I think they will do the finale. Right? I'm sure they'll perform last. Eunseo! - I think it'll be us. - Right? Okay, the first team to go is... Please! KEV1Z! I totally knew we'd go first. Please call on a team that will perform second. The second team to perform is... It must be us. She's staring at me. Ex-it team! Thank you! Thank you! You decided to have the I'm the Queen team go last. Do you have any special reason for that? The two songs are both hip and pretty cheery compared to our song. Our song is more conceptual and deep. If we leave a lingering impression and wrap up the performances, I thought the overall stage atmosphere would be great. That's why we chose them. [Third Competition, First Round, Dance Unit Order 1. KEV1Z 2. Ex-it 3. I'm the Queen.] - Thank you! - Good work! [Time to enjoy the cozy workshop after the interim evaluation.] [A campfire.] It's getting warm. It's warm. It's so beautiful. It's so warm. It's so beautiful. Unni, let's... [What'w Eunha doing over there?] Hello! It's Dayoung Cam! It will be posted on Queendom. - Just kidding. - It's behind-the-scenes. Queendom, thank you for giving us such great memories. Thank you! We all got to get together and got to talk a lot. If it weren't for this opportunity, we wouldn't have had the chance to have so much fun. I'm so happy that I got to meet such good friends. I felt so nervous and awkward before. But I feel more relaxed. I feel more comfortable now. I'll take a picture! Hey, everyone! Let's all beam our smiles! As colleagues working with music even outside of Queendom, I feel like I made good friends. I feel so supported by them. I feel great. She's the first friend I made through Queendom 2. 33, fighting! The key is not stable... It's the same pitch as this part. - I don't think I can hit that note. - You can do it, Unni. Your voice is floating. HolyBang, the winner of "Street Woman Fighter." So, ultimately, it's our fate to be the winner. You are mistaken. Can idols dance worse than dancer? Who said that? We don't need to be afraid. - I think you should do it a bit more fierce. - There you go! You can do it more fierce! It's okay! Here you go! She's doing something sexy. But why does she wipe her lips? She must have eaten somebody! [Is Hyolyn waiting for somebody?] Do I look so shabby? - I couldn't even enter and wait out at the entrance? - No, unni It's been changed a lot, right? They are going to regret it later. One, two, three! We owned a lot to our sunbaenims. [3rd Competition D-Day] [The cars has arrived at the contest hall today as always.] [Which team arrived first? Same-age team, 33.] Is your throat okay? It's okay today. 'My throat is really good today!' Think this way! [Ta-da!] For your throat to be better... What? What is this? It's honey bellflower tea. Wow, thank you! I feel great! Confidence! Confidence! Confidence! See you later! My throat is great! [LOONA Vocal members have arrived at the waiting room.] Hello! I feel empty here. Oh, they set up chairs for 12 people. We are going first. Sun and Moon. It's stuck on the wall. I feel weird that there are only three orders. I'm still very curious. What will Milky Way Who Embraced The Universe team do? Really. I hope their feels are not overlapped with ours. Who's there? Tell me the password! WJSN is pretty! - WJSN is pretty! - Okay! [Pass] Welcome! Wow, you're a fairy! I felt bored alone so I came here. - I felt bored alone so I came here. - Today we gathered all the pink in the world. - Tell me about it. - We gathered all! Your hair has been longer too. - Right. We used lots of snap hair clips. - You are Rapunzel! - Rapunzel! - We put on lots of hair extensions. Are Youngeun and Chaehyun going to come here? I wish they come here quickly. [The sun from Sun and Moon appears.] - Wow! [Are our younger sisters here?] Are you a princess? You are so cute! You are so pretty! [Vocal Unit all came to work!] [Dance unit members has arrived next.] Look carefully! It's a battle of the queens. Aren't we going to be the winner? [Eunseo and Yeoreum on the move looking for their partner.] It's my first time to visit unni's waiting room. [knocking carefully] Come in quickly! Quickly! Hello! Unni, how did you know we are here? Unni, we have prepared this since this morning. They say the gift for your children(?) is the best. Shall we say hello? Something like catnip balls Even though we don't know well about cats, we bought this and this. We bought everything we saw. I chose this, unni! You think they'll like it, right? [I think it's good! x2] I think it's good! I think it's good! I think they will like this! Indeed, the gift for the children is the best! We chose the good one! Thank you! I should give them as soon as I get home. Then see you later! Fighting! [The first round of the third competition rehearsal starts!] Okay. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! - Confidence! Confidence! Confidence! It's our first unit stage to show. So we will show a completed performance. We'll perform a stage that you want to see over and over again. That's our goal. We will try to show a stage that you can focus only on song and music. Let's talk our story on the stage! The stage that we can show our charm and make harmony to fulfill your heart... We will try to make that kind of stage. [Before the competition: Who is visiting the Queens?] Hello! [Colleagues who cheer for other members in the unit battle] Kep1er! Kep1er! Please lower this chair. Sorry! We prepared a humidifier for vocal members and a massage machine for dance members. - Three, two - Get, set, ready go! [3 seconds before meeting the unit members] [What are those?] Kep1er! Kep1er! Kep1er! - Are you vocal? - Thank you! - Thank you! [These are presents for the dance team!] This is what I like! - This is my favorite! - Me too! I'm happy! Thank you, Hiyyih! [Massage that makes dance members relaxed and less tense] [A humidifier that keeps vocal members' throats moist] Hey, look at this. "Mattang" You cooked well. We will win and come back today! [One hour before the competition] [The live judges who visited to cheer Queendom 2.] Are you planning to win against VIVIZ? Us? Hyolyn, let's flip the stage! Fighting! Brave Girl, you are the best! Brave Girls, fighting! LOONA, LOONA! Let's go! WJSN! Tear and sweep away! Let's fighting together! Kep1er! We love you! [The live judges starts entering 30 minutes before the competition.] [The live judges fully seated and filled the studio after sitting one by one.] [The live judges are all set!] [Queendom 2 announces its start in earnest.] [The heated atmosphere more than ever] Wow, the cheer sound! I feel like I came to see the concert. Long time no see! I missed you! I want to watch directly from there! - Me too! - Me too! They must be so excited so that they can shout out. Tell me about it. [The third competition has started with the big cheers.] The global comeback battle of K-pop main girl groups! Queendom 2. Hello, I'm Queen Manager Lee Yongjin. Happy to see you! Hello! We missed you! The Queendom 2 third competition will begin here today! It will be the last pre-competition ahead of the live final. Not only the team composition but also the competition method will go differently. You will get to see the Queens' reverse charms that you have never seen before. Are you wondering what kind of stage will unfold? Yes! Can we do it great? - We can do it! - Yes, we can! - Are you nervous, Yeoreum? - Yes. I look forward to it! Continuing this fever, let's first meet the Queens' reliable mentor, Queendom 2's Grand Master! - She's appearing! - Grand Master! [The real queen appears!] Doll! Doll! Hello, everyone! I'm the MC and Grand Master for Run the World: Queendom, Taeyeon! Nice to meet you! Really! Today's concept is a chic girl! Chic girl! The Queen Manager Yongjin introduced me nicely today as always. I always appreciate it! Today we have people who play a very important role on the stage. That's why he went there in advance. We will meet them in a moment. I suddenly feel nervous as I see their faces. Unni! Chew and eat up the stage! Got it? The Queendom 2 third competition will specially proceed in two rounds. The theme of the first round of the third competition you will get to see first is "Position Unit Battle." [Third Competition, First Round, Position Unit Battle] The thing that the singers who have different characteristics compose a new unit makes my heart pounded. The first round "Position Unit Battle" is that main vocals and main dancers from each team compose a unit with the ones from other team. The vocal unit gets a maximum of 2,500 points. The dance unit gets a maximum of 2,500 points. They compete for a total of 5,000 points. The points for each position unit are 2,500 points for the first place, 1,500 points for the second place, 500 points for the third place. We all still get some points. The points are really crucial. The third place would be fatal. That's what I'm saying. The points you get from the first round "Position Unit Battle" and the points from the 2nd round "Fantastic Queendom" will be combined to decide the final ranking of the 3rd competition. [Sigh deeply] [We can do it!] [Eunseo (Geundeok) is in mind control.] Before we get started, we have special judges in the studio today. Yongjin, please come out! Yes, I'll introduce you the special judges for the first round of the third competition. Who are you? Korea's best vocal and dance professionals! Please give them a round of applause! [Special judges: Korea's best vocal and dance professionals] Line-ups, Daebak! Hey, the dance unit must be so nervous! They will evaluate properly! I'm so nervous! We must do very well! We must do good! I'm very curious and looking forward to see how the music professionals will evaluate them. The votes for the first round of the third competition will be only from the live judges here in the studio. I hope you watch all the stages thoroughly. [Of course!] Then our performance is only for the live studio! Only for the studio! And we also have people who enthusiastically cheer for Queendom 2 as much as the ones in the studio! More and more global fans have come through global broadcasting. We feel always thankful and supportive. Right! Then let's open the door for the first round of the third competition that everybody is eagerly waiting for. Good! Shall we shout altogether? Run the world, Queendom! Is it the Sun and Moon team? They must be nervous since they're going first. I wonder what's song the first team will sing. Sun and Moon. Kep1er and LOONA. Run the World, Queendom 2. First round of the third competition will be staged by heart pounding vocals, It's a contest of vocals. Unni, you have to pound your heart. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. She learned that from the SNL. The first vocal unit is a group that will give you an emotional kiss. Everyone's got a sly look on their faces. Not literally kissing. It's LOONA and Kep1er. Let's see the harmony of the LOONA. Run the World, Sun and Moon. [Scream] I'm more nervous than them. I hope they do well. Fighting. Fighting. [Sun and Moon coming on stage with full of tension.] They must be nervous. It's an opening act. They must be nervous, since they are up first. This is a very adorable team. Firstly, please introduce yourselves. Hello, we are the Sun and Moon. Aren't they one team? Really, it looks like a single team. The team's name is Sun and Moon. How did you come up with the name? Then Moon is a reference to the LOONA. and the Sun is a reference to the Kep1er. So that's how we came up with the name Sun and Moon. Then can you show us your slogan? Sure ... 2, 3. If you vote for us, we won't eat you. Growl. So cute. Not at all scary, right? I don't think we should be afraid to be eaten by them. Like a storyline, a help brought by the Sun and Moon. These two teams seemed to be similar in many ways during the workshop. It looks like you all became very close. Right ... right? We talked a lot privately. We became very comfortable with each other. [Sun and Moon] [We're practicing. What are you doing? I kind of miss you...] [LOONA proposing a date with Kep1er.] [Let's get together tomorrow? Nothing going on tomorrow, right?] [I have nothing going on tomorrow!] [Youngeun is in school] [Butterfly Girls are planning a day out to look at flowers.] [Really?] [Daebak, I'm so excited.] [I look forward to it. My school is far, though. Be careful on your way.] [I'll bring my camera.] [Great! See you!] [Come looking alll pretty.] [The day of the date for the Butterfly Girls.] [Youngeun of Kep1er's school.] We are going to the butterfly garden today. And I'm driving there. Will we be fine? Will we? I've been worried since yesterday. I really haven't driven by myself. You are a good driver. Then why are you holding onto the seatbelt so tightly? It's keeps getting stuck here. My life depends on the seatbelt. We were both so sensitve. We were like, "Hey, hey..." Watch over there, over there. I wish the cars won't get in our way. Buses frighten me the most. Why are they like that? Too sensitive. - [I heard you entered the same street three times.] -Yes. Three times... - The same street? - Yes, three times. How could she do that? We should be over there. We missed again. - No. - It's fine. We were here before. I saw this before. If we miss it again, I'm going to cry. I'm going to ditch the car and walk. Okay, let's go together. [Rerouting] [Flustered] [It's the same spot as 15 minutes ago.] Just let me live. So we can go get some chicken later. [They survived.] - It was a nice driving tour. - Thanks. [Waiting for Youngeun.] Hi, Youngeun. - Don't run. - You'll fall down. You look pretty today. So pretty. Unnis were waiting for me. Felt like we all came out for an outing. [Meeting the other members of the Sun and Moon.] Hi. You are wearing a uniform. Looks cool. Get there safely. Unni, just before, You believe me? Hey! Let's meet up later at the butterfly garden. Get there safe. [LOONA driving along happily.] This feels more like an outing than a vocal unit practice. Let's go unni. This is so nice. I'm a bit nervous. Me too. There's a butterfly garden near Youngeun's school. "Don't Go" is one of our songs. [Singing "Don't Go" during the workshop.] [Confirmation of the song based on the day's workshop.] We thought it would be nice to physically see the butterflies and their beauty. This must be it. It's really nice. It's very pretty. That's why they call this the butterfly garden. Pretty. Wait. They have it? They do have it. It's flying around. It's flying around. This one's cute. They're like chicks. Why is this one upside down? [Scream] What wrong? Look at that one. [Why are you so scared looking at me?] This one's normal. Where? Daebak. That one's staying still. The flowers are magnificient. Are they real? I think they are real. The butterflies are taking honey from the flowers. [Artwork made out of taxidermied butterflies.] It'd be nice to incorporate these into our stage decoration. There are a lot of varieties. Seeing the butterflies reminded me of ourselves. The attractiveness. They are very colorful without being confusing. Everything seems to be in harmony. I was thinking that our performance of the "Don't Go" should bring forth what we felt when we saw the butterflies. How about we film our ad here? How about filming a teaser with the butterflies? Okay. Sun and Moon teaser. [Sun and Moon Teaser] [One butterfly, then another.] [Yello butterfly and dark butterly.] [Baby butterfly, older butterfly.] [If you want to meet the Butterfly Girls of the fairytales...] [Call us / We're open for casting.] Our greatest strength is our number. By fulfilling the chords, we grab it all. Like you said, because of large number, there's more that we can do. Six vocals performing as one. Let's try that as our main focus. We can do it. [LOONA harmonizing together.] [Perfect harmony on the first try.] We are a larger group compared to others. So the mixture of our ad-lib and harmony will be the focal point. Of all the vocal units this is the largest group. Perhaps their size would be their vocal strength. Can we have a little taste of what to expect? 2, 3. ♫ Sun and Moon ♫ Growl. [The harmonious girls make everyone laugh.] So cute. We had prepared hard for this contest. So please vote for us. Okay. This is the first of the last stage to come. We will do our best to make this a memorable performance. We were well taken care of by the unnis during the rehearsal. So we want to offer our words of gratitude to them. They seem like one team and not a collaboration. At first, we felt we had to work together with them on the stage. I have no regrets about that decision. It was a very good choice. How's it going? [Time to make friends, instead of competitors.] Our members only sang with each other. We never had a chance to sing with other people. I'm glad to have this opportunity now. This will be our first chance in the last stage of the contest. I hope this will be a performance the audience would like to see again and again. That's our goal. We will put on a good show. Fighting. Sun and Moon. What's this? Butterfly? Must be "Don't Go." Must be. Butterfly. [Don't Go by Sun and Moon (LOONA x Kep1er)] So exciting. Nice harmony. So pretty. They seem to fit well together. Whoa, Chuu! Nice job. So pretty. They seem to fit well with the Kep1er members. Their vocals too. Nice job, really nice job. They really performed well. Their harmony. They really performed with harmony. Like one team. It was a nice performance. Who's crying? Why are you crying? Don't cry. Dont' cry. Don't cry. Why are you crying? Just thinking everyone caring for each other, as one team would care for one another, it was really appreciative and nice. For us, this was the first time working with another team. I'm grateful that the team was Kep1er. We discussed about this quite a lot before. Even beyond Queendom 2, as colleagues of the song industry, I wish we can continue to learn from each other and work together. We are the Sun and Moon. Good bye. [Last time for picture taking as one team.] Sun and Moon! Good work! Your crying was very pretty. Even your tears matched the beat of the lyrics. When you cried, I was like this. No, she was more like this. I cried like that too! That tear captured the moment. They'll talk about it even when you are in your 30s. Really. Let's meet the second vocal unit. - Fighting. - Let's go. Time to embrace the universe. Knock, knock. - Let's go. - Unni, fighting! Fighting! Good luck. I really like this combination team. Me, too! The unique and fairy-like WJSN meets the VIVIZ. Run the World, Eunha embracing the space. Embrace the universe. They're perfect combination! Whoa, she looks like Rapunzel! Wow, it's a goddess. Hello!! We are the Eunha, embracing the universe. We heard that while you were discussing the performance, you received a request for an audition. It was one with a killing part. During the tough audition, we decided who will sing the part. So everyone, please look forward to it. I feel wonderful, because the weather is so nice. It really feels like a picnic. It's a good thing the weather is nice. The weather is nice but, the noise of the city Seoul including the Cheongdam sound ... I hope she comes before this starts to melt. Thank you for your request. I'm grateful for this. We prepared this for you. Really? It really feels like I'm at a picnic. The weather is so nice. Thank you for this welcome. I prepared this present. Thank you. Look at the size. It must contain something shiny. Like jewelry. 1, 2, 3 ... Gosh, it's blinding. It's like the one I have on my finger. It's our couple ring. - Wow. - Our friendship ring. We should wear this on stage. I love that idea. Thank you so much. I felt like this ring really solidified us as a team. So I was very grateful. - It was a struggle choosing our song. - Yes, it was. - We weren't able to decide during the workshop. - No, we couldn't. We can choose from one of Sunbae Red Velvet's songs too. What about Jung Seung Hwan's song? Or "You In My Arms" by Sunbaenim Yoo Jae Ha? That's good too. We'll never choose a song like this. [Milky Way Who Embraced the Universe's Nightingale Chat Room] [Hello! Did everyone rest well?] [Yes, I did.] [Me too! We need to choose a song though...] [Here's my top choices!] [1: Baek Yerin - "Across the Universe", 2: OH MY GIRL - "5th Season", 3: S.E.S. - "Show Me Your Love"] [We thought of some songs too...] [1: Wendy - "When This Rain Stops", 2: Lee Moon Sae - "Love Always Flees", 3: IU - "Dreams In Summer Night"] [This is hard... Don't you think we're all going for the same vibe though? We want something to focus on our vocal colors.] [What about Sunbaenim IU's "Hold My Hand"?] [Oh, I like that! I thought of that song too!] [I sang it on the radio once! I wanted to sing it again properly!] [Gosh, that's great! Shall we decide on that song then?] After racking our brains for days, we finally have it. We decided on Sunbaenim IU's "Hold My Hand". I think it fits all three of us perfectly. [IU - "Hold My Hand" was a soundtrack for the drama "The Greatest Love". IU wrote the music herself to express the 'start of love.'] It's a song that suits our vocal colors and can show off what we're capable of as singers. It perfectly fit the direction we wanted to go with. We chose it because we saw the production potential in it. - It suits this weather perfectly. - Doesn't it? - I think we chose well. - Yes. ♫ Just follow your heart ♫ ♫ Hold my hand now ♫ These lyrics make my heart flutter. It's great for this season. The song perfectly represents spring. I love it. - Shall we divvy up the parts? - Sure. "Our eyes meet", this part. - Just like Unni Eunha mentioned earlier... - Yes? - how about we do the back-and-forth? - Yes. Let's do that. The part where she connects with the crowd. [The killing part where IU connects with her fans.] - Let's make eye contact for this. ♪ What do I do? You're walking towards me ♪ - Okay. - ♪ Our eyes meet ♪ - Like this. ♪ Until when will you act oblivious ♪ - Just like this. Okay. - I like it. The killing part is up next, everyone. [IU's cute part which captured her fans and the people's hearts.] This part is really important. - This is the first time she says "I like you" here. - Right. She's suggesting to hold her hand here. Who should sing this part? I think this part should be sung by someone with a pretty voice. [Milky Way that Embraced the Galaxy has Seorae Village's nightingale.] [There is Hamster Mariah too.] [They also have WJSN's official power vocal.] - I think we should all try singing this part in our style. - I agree. - It's a killing part. - Right. [First contestant: Seorae Village's nightingale, Soobin] Gosh, how embarrassing. - You're so sweet. - Okay, next! This is so funny. [Second contestant: Hamster Mariah Eunha] You got the part! She said "like-ha". [It's cute, so let's watch it again.] Like-ha! It's because my name is Eunha. So I said "Like-ha." [Third contestant: WJSN's official power vocal Yeonjung] You're truly like the youngest. How cute. That melted my heart. Everyone sounds great. [Who will be the one to take the killing part of "Hold My Hand?"] We'll start from the bridge. It's the highlight. [Who ended up with the part "I like you"?] Shall I go? I immediately thought this was your part. [ ♪ I like you ♪ ] It tickled my heart. - Really? - I think you'll have to do it. Then I would like-ha too. - Congratulations! - Thank you. [The winner is Eunha, who is perfect for the killing part.] They're telling me this is an important part. So I'll have to practice even more. Shall we start? [Starts recording for the killing part, "I like-ha you".] ♪ I like you to the point I can't hide it ♪ - It suits her. - That was good. It's good, but I think I have to do better. Okay. Let's try it again then. She's a bit of a perfectionist too. [2nd time recording the killing part] I'll go again! [3rd time recording the killing part] I'll do it again. I'm sorry. I think it was too boring. That wasn't very good. Shall I go again? It's okay but let me try one more time. - She's pouring a lot of time into this killing part. - Yes. - This is the main part of the song. - Right. The music stops and you only hear the voice. [The Galaxy trusted her so Milky Way tries her very best.] What do you think? I thought it was good. I think... [Please Unni.] I like this one. Her voice is so pretty. It's so euphonious. Thank you. I think she has a clean and clear voice. It confirmed we made the right decision. [Next up is Yeonjung, the powerful vocal who's in charge of the high notes!] Do you think I'm singing too powerfully? The power is good. But it kind of feels heavy, like you're singing in a musical. Maybe it's because I'm in a musical right now. [Yeonjung is currently in the shocking rock musical "Lizzie".] I'm working on a musical simultaneously with this. So I don't have much time to practice. That's why I've been practicing whenever I can like this. [She continues to practice even at her musical's waiting room.] I've been given the chance to show off my vocals. So I didn't want to lose this opportunity. I want to do great for both. I think I'm too powerful compared to Unni Eunha and Soobin. Your voice came out very thick. It sounds like a grand symphony. My voice is usually not heavy though. I'll try to sing more pretty. [Vocals going through the roof] The speaker is going to rip. - I was so startled. - Wow. - That was good. - I like this one. Yes, this one. This is the one? It's hard. In Yeonjung's case, she's extremely powerful. Her voice just explodes like a refreshing soda. I felt like we had nothing to worry about. [It's finally Seorae Village's nightingale, Soobin's time.] She looks nervous. I'm sure she is. Our group didn't have many opportunities to show off our vocals. [Soobin rarely got the chance to show off her vocals since she was in a large group.] I felt this would be a great opportunity. That's why I feel a bit of pressure too. Third verse, "Tell me your heart." - Is the note, Mi? - No, it's Fa. - ♪ Until when ♪ - Okay, go with that note. [The note is higher for Soobin's part.] This part is really hard. - Fighting! - Fighting! [Big sigh] This song is extremely high. In the case of WJSN, all these powerful high notes were mostly sung by Yeonjung. So it wasn't easy. You look scared at the part "Stop". - Let's try this part again, okay? - Okay. My gosh. It's okay! Being confident is better. [Trying again with confidence.] [That's not it...] It's a little disappointing. Okay. It was really annoying me. There might be people watching me for the first time. So I didn't want to make a mistake. I wanted to show my best to them. [Full of notes] [Lyrics filled with Soobin's efforts.] This is evidence of my Unni's hard work. Taking care of my voice will be key for this song I think. This handkerchief has become a must for me. We're about a week out now. I'm very nervous. [Practice... and practice again. Soobin practices nonstop.] I hope many people will get to know... what my voice is and how I sing. When was your happiest moment as a singer? We had a fan meeting not too long ago. It's been a long time since our last one. We didn't go on stage for a long time too. I got very emotional while performing. [She felt true happiness performing on stage after a long break.] Performing was what I desired the most. Singing and dancing on the stage... makes me happy. We'd like to melt all the emotions that were frozen during winter... by singing this sweet song. We'll try to create a performance... that will be very emotional. The swing is so pretty! They look like spring princesses. I'm getting nervous about Milky Way Who Embraced the Universe. Me too. I think our images might overlap. Please do well. Please. ["Hold My Hand" - Milk Way Who Embraced the Universe] What is this? A music video? Gosh, how cute. - Hold it! - Hold my hand too, please. I really want to hold her hand. Gosh, Soobin! She's singing right in front of the audiences. Unni! I'm getting goosebumps. - It's the killing part. - Who's singing it? [This is what you call a power high note.] Wow, I'm so proud. She was great. Soobin has a pretty voice. So cool! Milky Way That Embraced the Galaxy! - Milky Way That Embraced the Galaxy! - That Embraced the Galaxy! - Gosh. - Great job. They're so pretty and did really great. They're a human version of cherry blossoms. I saw Soobin's professional moment. - Her dress had a long tail. - Right. - She flipped it back when the wind was blowing. - She did. It was so cool. She's so professional. The moment they started with Sunbaenim Yeonjung on the swing with the wind in her hair... I thought the fans would love this. But the moment Sunbaenim Soobin starting singing by the audience... I thought this team has a real good chance of winning. The song made your heart warm. It was very comforting. - Let's all hug. - Like we did during the workshop. - Good job. - Seriously. It felt like it was over too quickly. We got to perform very close to the audience. The performance gave me a lot of happiness. - ♪ Until when ♪ - I knew you could do it! Good job! You did so good. Great job. - Great job, seriously. - You did so good. - You mean it? - Yes and you were so pretty. The most important thing... was the fact that I wanted to hold all three of your hands while watching you on the screen. - Seriously? - You were all so pretty. I made eye contact with Unni Soobin at the end and my heart stopped. I'm serious. I'm sure there are people... seeing me for the first time through Queendom. I didn't have many opportunities to show my voice. I felt like this performance fulfilled a lot of my dreams. I'm in a great mood. Run the World. Queendom 2. We only have one vocal unit left to see now. It's time to say goodbye to Unni Minyoung. - You don't have to get first place. - Right. - You don't have to. - Don't be nervous! - I just wish you would perform a stage you'll be satisfied with. - Exactly. - She's right. - Yes. You all know who it is, right? - Yes! - Yes. That's right. I'm very excited too. Honestly, I'm super excited for this. I'm really excited. The main vocals met. ♪ I wonder how they'll tear up the stage this time ♪ ♪ Will they hit high notes or do ad-libs ♪ - ♪ Don't think about it ♪ - ♪ They'll do everything ♪ - Sunbaenim Minyoung had a tough time with her voice during the workshop. - Right. So I'm a little curious on how she'll do. [Minyoung's throat condition wasn't good during the mid-evaluation.] I sang this for the first time, so I'm sorry. At first, I didn't know the condition of her throat was that bad. But she was coughing a lot. You keep coughing. The aftermath of COVID-19 is really serious. My throat feels very unstable. She even said she was nervous about her throat's condition. But I kept raising the key without knowing. So I felt really bad. Let's adjust the key according to your condition. My confidence is very low right now, to be honest. But with my condition being bad as well, the pressure hit me much harder. If confidence was the issue, then I wanted to take care of her so she could lean on me. Hello. How's your throat? I just wish I wouldn't cough. I think your condition is more of a psychological issue. Don't think, "I think I'm going to cough." - You're not going to cough. - I won't. - You have to hypnotize yourself. - Right. - "My condition is great today." - "I'm totally fine." Like this. You have to be brazen. [Minyoung enters the recording studio feeling burdened.] How are you? Is your throat okay? Yes, I think so! ["To My Youth"] [33 puts aside their anxiety and starts recording.] Is it fast or slow while you sing? I think it should be slower if that's your intention. We're trying to pour our emotions into each word. - So I don't think we can stay on this beat. - Yes. You're right. [Minyoung calmly starts singing again.] Minyoung, how about you don't sing the exact note from the original song, but just try to focus on the emotions. Okay. [ ♪ How much must have it hurt ♪ ] [Just listening to their warm harmony brings comfort.] The lyrics made me very emotional. Me too. The lyrics heal me. Me too. I'm someone who needs to be comforted. You too and your members also. Don't feel pressured. Don't think you need to do well either. Don't worry about making a mistake. Forget all that stuff. Even if you make a mistake and fall or your voice breaks, just think you're singing in front of people who will love that side of you too. That's why you need confidence in these times. - I'm confident! - Confidence! - I'm very confident. - Passion! Passion! Passion! Come on up. [Shocked] Welcome! Ta-da. Are you proposing to me or something? I prepared it for you. What do you think? Daebak. I need to feed Hyolyn grade-A Hanwoo meat. [Piling it with 1++ Hanwoo for Hyolyn] [Min Jang Geum prepared food for Hyolyn.] What is this? I did some researching. I read you can drink up to seven bottles of soju. I can't. - I was so shocked. - That was ages ago. Fighting, 33! - Wow, thank you. - Let's eat. It's tasty. - Is it okay? - Yes. It's yummy. [Eating nonstop] [Hyolyn is devouring Min Jang Geum's love and effort.] - You seriously made all this? - Yes. - You're a good cook! - Can I be confident about my cooking skills? Honestly, the thought is more important than the taste in cooking. The thought is more important than the taste in cooking. - Are you saying it's not good then? - No, it's good. I'm saying the taste isn't important. - You cook with the person who'll be eating it in mind. - Right. - Yes, I was thinking of you as I cooked. - That thought— Only Lyn. - This is friendship, right? - Of course. - It's friendship. Don't worry about that. - It's not love, right? I'm so happy you're enjoying the food. Is this the first time you'll be performing a song that comforted you? - I think so. - Really? Right when I saw the lyrics... and listened to the song, I thought, "I can see how this can be healing." - That came to my mind. - I see. I'm the type who struggles to open up about my problems. Why? Well... I think that's natural to me. I have a responsibility in my group, - and things I have to give up too. - Right. - That's the nature of being in a group. - There are things I have to fulfill. I never told my members I was having a hard time in the past. Not even once. I'm Sistar's leader, Hyolyn. I'm the captain of discipline and nagging. [Hyolyn always showed her brave side wherever she went.] My members never even saw me cry. I felt like my members would break down... if I showed weakness. [Leader Hyolyn had to become stronger for everyone.] So I endured until the very end. Out of responsibility. I think that's the weight the leader has to carry. [They can empathize because they share similar experiences.] The only time I can say that is when I sing. So I make songs that give you comfort from listening... and from singing it. I pour my sincerity into it. If even just one person knows that, - then I feel a sense of accomplishment. - I see. Through this performance and opportunity... I wish she would have a moment to comfort herself. I also would like many others to feel the same way too. That's what I thought. It's nice talking like this. Ask me if you have any struggles. I'm always ready to listen. Help me build up my confidence. - All right. - Help me everyday. [#33, #Confidence, #Fighting] [D-1: Last practice] This note keeps moving. So if we don't hit the notes right... - then I think it'll sound discordant. - Okay. Try this "Ah" part, Minyoung. I'll try thinking up some ad-libs for that part. Just shout it out! [Hyolyn carefully starts harmonizing on top of Minyoung's voice.] It's perfect. - I couldn't practice much. - Gosh, you're still coughing. I'm in big trouble. - No, you're not. Just do it. - Okay. Confidence! Confidence! Confidence! Okay. "I'm the best vocalist." Hypnotize yourself. [They start rehearsing after hypnotizing themselves into confidence.] [They start off at different stages.] How should we perform this? What if we start in two separate places? So we can express loneliness and anxiety. Like we've been left behind... at a lonely garden. I thought we could meet here later. We can make it so that we're singing to each other. What do you think about meeting as we sing? The message we want to relay is in the lyrics too. So I want the lyrics to be seen by the audience too. If possible, maybe we can handwrite it. [They'll fill the screen with handwritten lyrics.] "Why do those words feel directed towards me?" "Why do I feel so comforted?" We'll have to try hard so that our message is delivered well. - I wonder if they'll understand 33's intentions. - I wonder. I hope they do. What message will they deliver to us? Please open your eyes and ears to their performance. Run the World, 33! Let's go. Confidence. Confidence. Confidence. - Thank you. - You're the best. Where is Unni Hyolyn? She's sitting on the stage. Just on the ground. Is she lost? [They emotionally prepare themselves to start the performance.] [To yours and my youth that was painful but beautiful.] - I'm already touched. - Seriously. I'm already sad. ["To My Youth" - 33] What do I do? Gosh, the lyrics. It's too sad. [Main vocalist doesn't disappoint.] Wow. They were great. Great job. She's so good. What? Eunji! [They're emotions are synching here too.] It's so touching. - I'm getting choked up. - Seriously. - This performance was insane. - It's unbelievable. I wanted to cry if I didn't have to perform later. [These girls went through puberty not long ago.] - The last part got me. - Yes. Yeseo started crying as soon as they started singing. She cried as soon as they sang "How." - It's because she's going through puberty. - You're right. It's Yeseo's song. Gosh, I got chills. I think that's why she wanted to perform with someone her age. - They were looking back at each other's youth. - Right. [Friends of the same age, who can comfort each other.] [They still share the same emotions now.] Thank you. [They send a warm round of applause for their friendship.] [They come down feeling much more relieved.] Minyoung was fine. But she started tearing up because I did. - I could see her eyes water, so I got emotional too. - Right. [Minyoung got emotional because of Hyolyn's look.] The thought of me saying this to you... made me emotional all of a sudden. I saw her come to me from afar, and I could see her pupils shaking. [The two friends faced each other on stage.] I could see her get emotional. I was doing my best to hold it in, but seeing her... I got emotional. So I almost cried. I almost made her cry. She's fessing up. She almost cried because of me. [Showering her with cheers] Good job! How are you so good? I almost cried at the end. - It seemed that way. - I could see that. I was reminded of you guys too. Why are you going to cry here? - Why are you crying? - I'm not! You should've cried there then. - Why didn't you cry on stage? - You should've cried on stage. Queendom 2's vocal unit performances for Round 3 has come to an end. Let's give another big round of applause... to the three teams who gave us unbelievable performances. Great job. Out of the three vocal units who performed today, please vote for just one team. - What? One team? - Just one? That's such a precious vote then. - It really is. - Seriously. [Sun and Moon's "Don't Go" showcased harmonizing that touched people's hearts.] [Milky Way The Embraced the Galaxy, vocal fairies who brought spring with "Hold My Hand."] [33's "To My Youth" which comforted all the youths in the world.] All right, we'll begin voting... for the vocal units in Round 3. Please press the number of the vocal unit. We have to receive 2,500 points! Please! 2,500 points? That's higher than the points we received last time. Please save us just this once! What ranking do you think we'll get? First place. Don't lie! It's number two! It has to be number two without a doubt. [They can't be too quick to predict the Live Judges' hearts.] I get a good feeling this time. I thought, "I think we have a shot." I think we'll get first place if our sincerity was felt. We'll end the voting in five seconds. - Five, four, three, two, one. - Two, one! The voting has ended. [Voting has ended for the Live Judges.] [Who did the Live Judges choose?] - They chose a good song. - I agree. They tore up all the high notes. The voice matched with the mood very well. It was great to listen to. It was very comfortable and heart-warming to watch. The delivery was great. I thought team ** had a bigger impact. That team's performance made me a little emotional. My members said not to come back if I get last place. Bring back good results. Or don't come back. All right. It was fun, girls. I'll see you one day, or not. Okay then. Do you think you can go back to the waiting room? I think so. I wasn't alone. - We'll reveal the results for the vocal units now. - Oh, my gosh. [The members have the results in their hands.] - My gosh. - You take a look at it first. - I'll look at it first, as the leader. - Yes, okay. - Don't tell us. - What do I do? Should we go home? It's either we win big or lose big. - Let's not let the results affect us. - Right. I feel like you'll be affected the most. I might be like, "What? What did you say?" I hate this moment the most. - What do you think we got? - Gosh, what do I do? - Shall I look at it first then? - Yes. [Shares the result nonchalantly.] [What's the meaning of this smile?] [The vocal unit members are back with the results.] [Applauding for now] Good job! Sun and Moon. Come here. Good job. [Hyolyn is back with the results too.] Great job. You worked hard! Unni! - Hi. - Did you do a good job? Well... - it's as we expected. - Oh, really? It's a ranking we never received. That's all the rankings though. Including third place. - What? Come on. - That's why I said that. Shall I reveal it right away? - She looks happy though. - Me? I think she has her poker face on. There's a hidden meaning behind that laugh. [No way] I was scared when I opened it too. [Ta-da] [What's the shocking result of the vocal unit match?] It's time to see some burning passion. It's the dance unit teams. - Shall we practice more? - I had a lot of thoughts. I've never done a concept like this before. Confidence is a must for this. I'm serious. It would be good to see side people have never seen before. I'm a dancer, but I perform on the same stage as them. I hope you would think this way on stage, "I'm fine with dying from dancing like this." Then you'll experience a miraculous moment. Did you enjoy it? Yes! Please pick number 2! Okay! What? [But I'm number 1?] No, no! I'm sorry. - Number 1! - Pick number 1! [Dayeon was surprisingly into cheering for Milky Way That Embraced the Galaxy.] What do I do? I'm speechless.
