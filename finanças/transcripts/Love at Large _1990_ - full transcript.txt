You know what your problem is? You don't know what you want! And if you had it, you wouldn't know it! If you had what I wanted, I'd know what to do with it! What the hell is that supposed to mean? That's it! You've gone too far this time! Where's my goddamn gun? We were never right for each other! You've probably been saving yourself... for all those babes you got stashed somewhere. Doris, number one, there is no other woman in my life... and number two, if there was... she'd know I was livin' with someone who I loved! Or used to love. Well, it's a good thing we never got married! Oh, you're damn right! After the honeymoon, I'd feel like a new man. And so would you. - Ohh! - Where's my damn hat? - Harry! - What? Not even a good-bye kiss? Oh, answer it, Harry. I'm twin' . It might be important. - Yeah? - Is this the Dobbs agency? Yeah, this is Harry Dobbs. Would you handle a situation for me? Yeah, sure, I could be available. - Who is it? - It's about a case. Uh-huh? Do you know where the Blue Danube is? Oh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm! Yeah, I... I got that address. Mm-hmm. I could meet you there. What do you look like? Me? I'm regular build, regular height. It's a woman, isn't it? How much do you charge, Mr. Dobbs? Well, we have a standard retainer of $500... and I will need that in cash or cashier's check. You son of a bitch! Jesus! What was that? Was that a gunshot? No, that was a car outside. Yes. Tell her you love me. Go on, tell her. - My name is Miss Dolan. - Right, right. All right, I'll meet you there at that time, Miss Dolan. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. What is the matter with you? I could've lost that interview! Miss Dolan? Get out! Go prowl around somewhere else! I never want to see you again! - Will you shut up in there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What's the matter with you? - And you, too. Mademoiselle Dolan. Manhattan in a champagne glass. Bien, madame. So... what's on your mind, Miss Dolan? Nothing like this has ever happened... to me before, Mr. Dobbs. Harry. Nothing like what? I need you to follow a man. He can't know that you're doing it, or... Don't worry. He'll never know. I could be put in serious jeopardy. Why do you want me to follow this guy? I can't tell you that. Please... they say you can be trusted. Who says I can be trusted? I saw it in a phone book in the train station. Please, Mr. Dobbs. We haven't much time. I'll pay you $2,000 plus expenses... to follow Rick for one month. He's coming to this restaurant tonight. Cozy- He'll be here at 9:00. Until you learn the meaning. Of the blues. Please say yes. I'm staying at the Hotel St. Simone. I want to know who she is. She? Uh-huh. It's very difficult for me living in another place... wondering when it's my turn. Shortens one's life. Makes one feel unlucky. And that's not for me. I've always been a lucky person. He's six feet tall and has sandy hair. He wears glasses and dresses smartly. He also smells nice. Well, that's a relief. He may appear very charming, but believe me, he's dangerous. I'll need his name... address... type of car, and tag numbers, if you got 'em. What do you mean, dangerous? This operative began surveillance on February 14. Subject known as Rick... was seen leaving the Blue Danube nightclub... accompanied by a female companion. Rick, I've never been to this place before. Tag number... 475T3W. Come to bed. They gotta be married. - St. Simone Hotel. - Miss Dolan's room, please. I'm sorry, Miss Dolan's not in. - You're sure? - Yes. Any message, sir? No, no. No messages. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. You know, I saw this blond-haired guy... leaving here with his wife, and he sure looks like... this guy I was in the army with, but I can't tell. His hair's longer, and I don't remember his last name. You mean Mr. King? Mr. King? Nope. Wrong guy. - Good morning. - Hi, Katie. How are you? - Hi, kids. - Hi, Katie. Have a nice day, OK? - Bye, dad. - Bye. Get an "A" in math. - See you later. - Bye, Susan. Thank you. You're welcome. Paper! Paper! Have a paper, mister. You friend Rick is going by the name of Frederick King now. Did you get a good look at him? Good enough. And her? Look, Miss Dolan, excuse me for being blunt, but... Please. I like blunt. No, I mean, this is all pretty clear, right? Mr. King is a happily married man. - He never told you. - Told me what? Look, why don't I just charge you the retainer fee? I'll even buy you dinner. Maybe I'll give you half the retainer fee back. I want you to continue to follow him. Are you sure you want this guy in your life? - Mr. Dobbs... - Harry. As long as I know what Rick is doing, I have a life. Gil. Dinner will have to wait, I'm afraid. I have a previous engagement. You don't know. What love is. Until you've learned the meaning of the blues. Until you've loved. A love you've had to lose. You don't know. What love is. Daddy, daddy, the taxi's here! Thank you, Mr. King. Flight 2495, gate 89. Thank you. I'm on the same flight as that gentleman. - Flight 2495, right? - Yeah. - Do you have a ticket? - No. I'll need one. Round trip. Coach. Hi, babe. It's me. Yeah, I miss you, too. No. I won't be able to call you for a couple of days. I'm going to be moving around quite a bit, you know? Oh, I miss you, too, Doris. Yeah. Please deposit 25 cents. Look, this is gonna be... a very rough couple of months for both of us. Please deposit.. Hey, how about goin' out to Culver today? - Sure, we can do that. - All right. Wake up! - See that blue and white taxi? - Yeah. - Follow it. - OK. Don't get too close. You know, I had a customer... that was following a cab like this one time... and, boy, was that something. Yeah? What happened? Wound up halfway across the state... in a drunk tank, where I met my third wife. She was the nutritionist at the honor farm. - Hiram, how are you? - Good, good, Jimbo. - How you doin"? - Pretty good. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Is my truck ready? - Yes, sir. You better give me a receipt. You don't want me to wait? No, just give me a receipt. Last guy I picked up wanted me to wait. I think he was on an expense account or something. You can tell by the way they're dressed. He had a funny little moustache. OK, OK. Just don't get lost. How could I get lost? I'm just going to be sitting here. No, you're not. You're gonna follow that truck. If you're going to that farmhouse down there... I can just take you right on down there. - It wouldn't be a problem. - Aw, would you just shut up? I'll be right back. Daddy! Daddy! Son of a bitch. Keep the change. Write me out a receipt. I'm gonna sign it for tax purposes, so it's legitimate. Fine! Your room's down on the end. OK. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. I need a room. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Leaving? - I'll make it short, Larry. - My job's finished. - Well, what does that mean? Wire me the money. I'll be here about two more days. I have the feeling... you're holding something back, Mr. Dobbs. Hey, I told you what I saw. He visited someone on a ranch somewhere. Was there a woman on the ranch? Yeah. Looked like a family to me. What if I told you we were to be married once? After all, she didn't want to be a bigamist. No, Larry, I never was. Well... Just don't turn your back on him, Mr. Dobbs... unless you want a hole in it. I'll keep that in mind. Call me tomorrow. I'll be here. Right. And I'll be here. You crossed yourself as well as everybody else... including me. Room service, please. - Hello? - Hello, Doris? Harry! Where are you? Hey, sounds like you're having a party there. Oh, I'm just listening to music. - Yeah? With who? - A few friends. Hey, pour me another highball, would you? You want me never to work, Doris? Is that what you want? I don't want anything anymore, Harry. I've wised up. And with each day, I learn more. - The price is 250. - 175. - The price is 250. - 200. The price is 250. I'll tell you what... I'll give you 150 for as long as I use it... and then when I'm finished, you get it hack free. How about that? - Oh, you mean rental. - That's right, rental. Well, see, I'm not in the rental business. The price is 250. Thank you, honey. - Did you help make these? - Yes. - Howdy. - Hello. - Can I help you? - Well, I seem to be lost. Where are you going? That's the problem. I really don't know. I parked my car up the road and saw your house. Say, Ellen! What's up? It's fine! Maybe we can help you get back on track. Where are you coming from? Culver. If I could use your phone, I'd be glad to pay for it. - Don't be silly. Come on in. - Thank you. Got one more lunch to deliver. Do you want some lunch? I can fix you lunch inside. No, thank you. I'm in a hurry. But a cup of coffee would be great. You got it. Hi. - I'll race you to the door. - OK. The phone's in here around the corner, sir. Thank you. What's your name? - Harry. - Harry what? - Uh, Harry Johnson. - Harry Johnson. That's right. Where are you from? You're not from here. No, I'm not. I... I just need to use the phone. Mom, do we have to let him use the phone? Honey, you finish your colorin', OK? Cute. Merle, it's me, Harry Johnson. That's right. I'm lost. Merle wants to know where I am. Crooked River Ranch, Northwest Prairie Road. The lady of the house says... Crooked River Ranch, Northwest Prairie Road. Oh, really? Oh. Mm-hmm. Really? Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Aha. Thanks for the water, Mrs. McGraw. You're welcome, Art. So, he wants 300 gross of metal and then 200 gross plastic. Great. Thanks. Bye. Did you figure out where you're going? Oh, yes. Thanks. Boy, if I had this place, I'd be the happiest guy in the world. Yeah, well, it takes a lot of work, Mr. Johnson. That it does. Still, it brings everyone so close together... you know what I mean? - Hello. - Hi. - James McGraw. - Johnson. Harry Johnson. - Good to meet you. - Good to meet you. I was just telling your wife... what a wonderful spread you have here. I'm in grommet sales myself. Grommets are those little round plastic and metal... Yeah. I know what a grommet is. - You do? - Sure. Oh, that's better than most people. - So, did you make your call? - Yes, sir. Thank you. And thanks for that great coffee, Mrs. McGraw. You're welcome. Bye. Bye, little girl. I love you. We're at Harbor Town Country Club... in beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina... where Harry Dobbs is teeing off on the first hole. Oh, he sliced that one into the rough. This has always been a tough fairway for Dobbs. You don't know what love is. Until you learn the meaning of the blues. Until you've loved a love you had to lose. You don't know. What love is. You don't know how lips hurt. Well, it's tough, babe. I know it's tough. You've got to bear with me, hon. I mean, it's only going to be a few more years... that I'll work at this pace... and then we can start doing the thing, you know... OK, look, I better go, babe, OK? I love you. OK, good-bye. - Good news, Jim? - Yeah. More coffee, honey? That cheeseburger to go will be up in just a second. I'm going to hit you again, Jim. My man. Sure is good to see you. It's good to see you, Cal. How long you here for this time? Well, I might leave for a couple days... but I'm here for a few months now, anyway. Hey, how's that other spread of yours? Is that doing OK? Doubled our grazing. Sold real well at market. Good night, Cal. - Take her easy, Jimbo. - Hiram. Thanks, lady. My goddamned car committed suicide. Do you think you could give me a lift? Seeing as how we're both staying at the same motel. The Love Manual. Out. Come on. What would that prove? Look, I am here visiting friends... and I have seen you three times in two days... and you have not told me why. Maybe we have some of the same friends. One word, and you walk. Uh, thanks again for the lift. Maybe next time we can discuss that book you're reading. - Phone for you, Doris. - Oh, thank you, Mario. Yeah. Hello? Hello, Doris. This is Stella. Oh, right, right. Hey, somebody turn that down. I've been expecting your call. What'd you find out? Basically what you told me. He is on a case. Does he see her every day? Uh, no. Only in the city. Did you talk to him? Yes, but by accident. What'd you talk about? Well, we didn't. We didn't. No. His car broke down, and I gave him a ride. That was pretty stupid, don't you think? It was unavoidable. Oh, yeah? And what else was unavoidable? Well, what is that supposed to mean? Your agency said I could trust you. Look, I am not going to have... this conversation with you, Doris. They said a woman could get closer to him. Now that I know what they mean, I want my money back. Look, I'm going to get off the phone now, all right? If you want to replace me, that is your privilege... but right now I'm going to get some sleep. Yeah, for a long time, because you're fired! Fired? That's great. What am I going to do? Miss Dolan's room, please. - I'm sorry. She's checked out. - What? Miss Dolan's checked out, sir. Did she leave a forwarding number? No, sir, she didn't. Right. This better be good. - What? - Mr. Dobbs? Oh, uh, Miss Dolan. Mm-hmm. Rick called me. I'm frightened. Please come back. Did you check out of the St. Simone Hotel? I had to. He threatened me. I'm in the Devonshire now, registered under Phillips. He'll kill me if he finds me, Mr. Dobbs. Harry. Relax. He can't get to you before I do. Uh, are you at all interested in his second wife? What did you say? Another wife? Look, I'll talk to you about it all when I get in tomorrow, OK? Yes. Don't tell me anything else now. - Thank you, Mr. Dobbs. - Harry. Good night. One of us is going to move. Not before the other explains what is going on. I don't know what you're talking about. I can find out, you know. I'm not going to be very happy if you're working for McGraw... or King. Is that a threat? Let's just say I'm very good at what I do. - Fooled me. - What's that supposed to mean? You get too close to your subjects, Mr. Dobbs. You mean because I went to his house? Well, you're wrong. That just happened to be a very, very shrewd move. And talk about getting too close. You got a burgundy super classic at the airport, hmm? And what about picking me up on the road, hmm? - Cardinal sin. - That was unavoidable. What, are you on your off hours now? Look, I want you to move. Bring us a couple of Bloody Marys, will you, honey? No ice, no juice, please. - Look, Mr. Dobbs... - Harry. Harry. This is not ethical. If we were discussing ethics, it'd be pretty silent here. Excuse me. There you go. You better hang onto this... because we'll probably be ordering a few more. OK. Thank you. Bad luck to refuse a toast. Does that book explain when you're falling for someone... whether it's the smile or the situation you're going for? Are you in love with someone, Mr. Dobbs? Ham!- Do you think that she is in love with you? Well, that's hard to tell. She's got a temper, that one. But, see, we're sort of broken up now. Demolished, basically. But when I think back on it... I can't even remember the tough times. - Are you waiting for her? - Waiting? Yes. The one who is in love always waits. Says who? It's in the book. The only waiting I've been doing... is outside some guy's house. Both houses. Maybe you're in love with someone else. Yeah? Well, who? Now, come on, now, you got to see me through this. Please? Please? Please, please, please? Please? It is a fact that you can squash... the person that you are in love with... under the weight of love itself. - Especially during an argument. - Squash? Yes, and then something usually happens... that makes you jealous and feel threatened. Not me, sorry. And you say that you can't get hurt... because you are no longer a part of it. A part of what? This feeling of love that you have. But you're suffering, because, in fact... they're not a part of it, and then you blame yourself. - No, it's all her fault. - And then you feel guilty... - and you suffer. - Oh, swell. So, either because you want to feel guilty... or because you want to show the other person... how very unhappy you are, you become critical of yourself. You change your clothes, you change your habits... you change your hair, and you wait. It's the lover's signature. What is? They're the ones who wait. Am I going to see you around? No, Mr. Dobbs. From now on, when you turn around... all you're going to see is your shoulder. No. I mean, you know... a show, a dinner, or something unethical. No, I'm afraid that I can't do that. Why? You waiting for someone else? - Yes. - Oh. I mean, I have an agency I have to deal with. Oh, forget the agency. Hang out a shingle. Go into business for yourself. It's the only way. - Like you. - That's right. You know I can find out your name. Oh, really? You know, I'm not so sure of that. Well, you can make it easy, or you can test me. Stella. Oh, I like that. You got another name? Don't say Smith. You don't want to know me. Too late for that. Why do you think that your man has two families? Most bigamists do. Who hired you to follow me? Do you think that he loves them both equally? Does it matter? Well, don't you think it would? To him, I mean? Would you stop with that stuff“? I... was it Miss Dolan? Believe me, it's... it's not important. - Mr. Dobbs. - Harry. I'm so glad you're here. Would you like a drink? - Aw... - Cognac all right? Sure. Please, go on in and sit down. I'll be right there. I'm ready now to hear what you've learned. So... from the beginning. From the beginning? Well, I didn't much like the airplane trip. You poor dear. You must be exhausted. Please, go on. Why don't we start with what you know? It'd be a lot easier. Well, I'm afraid my story is very complicated, Harry. May I call you Harry? You think I still love him, don't you? You think that's why I came to town. I know he does... To be close to him, wait my turn... take my chances. Well, I could never love him again. Especially if... what you said on the phone is true. How true it is, I can't tell you... but I know it to be a fact. Two wives. My God. I'm sorry. Look, just let him go. Wipe him out of your memory. Whatever you do, don't be jealous. You'll... you'll start hurting yourself. You'll feel guilty. Your hair. You'll... you'll cut your hair... and I kind of like it the way it is. He's so very dangerous. He's taken money from people and beaten them up... Maybe... even murder. All around good guy, huh? I'm really glad you're here. Oh, my God. It's him. - Dry cleaning. - Thanks. Here you go. - Fine. - Thank you, sir. I think I'd better get a room in this hotel... On this floor, if I can. Yes. I want you to. Now that you're here... I feel that no one can lay a finger on me. Right. Uh, keep your door locked. Don't let anybody in. Yes. - I'm going to check in now. - Yes. Over here on your right... we have the honor bar, Mr. Dobbs. We do have twenty-four-hour room service available. On the rooftop, we have a ninety-foot pool. Whoa. And I hope that you enjoy your stay. No golf course? Some of our larger suites do have putting greens. Thank you very much. He's just checked in on the same floor. Twenty four hours in a day, buster. Use them. Out. So, I suppose you think I'm a failure, right, Corinne? What do you want to hear, that people don't get fired? Well, they do. That's the bottom line, kid. But I didn't do anything wrong. Who said anything about wrong? The client didn't like what you were doing... so you got canned, pure and simple. I didn't deserve it! You should've stood up for me! Stella, from the beginning... I'm wondering what you're doing here. You wander in, say you want detective work... like it's a haircut. Your first big assignment... You blow it. So I let you down, is that what you're saying? I'm saying you're smart, you look OK... you got some class. I have to do this kind of work just to get attention. You don't. Why do you want to hang around shady characters... looking for things that never add up? You gotta be a little weird for that, Stella... and you're not weird... Not that weird. Not enough to keep a man away. Whatever happened to that guy? He come back or what? What? Look, I know you're on the rebound... from a bad love deal... but this work ain't a cure-all, you know. So, you want to get rid of me, Corinne? Stella, I am trying to help you. You're the kind of gal who should be out... with a guy on a date, not a stakeout. You let me worry about the men in my life. And you let me run my business the way I have to! Oh, so I am fired. Oh, that's... that's fine. That's fine. Just... just great. Just perfect. Perfect! Miss Dolan? It's me, Harry. Open up in the name of the law. Miss Dolan. Miss Phillips? - Hello? - Doris, it's Stella. Who? Stella. Hey, I thought I fired you. Yeah, I got your message. Then what do you want? Well, actually, I was wondering if you had a number on Harry. Have you known my husband very long, Mr. Wyman? No, not really, but long enough. Mmm. So, what is the message my husband asked you to deliver? Mrs. King, does the name "James McGraw"... have any meaning to you? Um, no. That's not familiar to me. Why? Well, he's someone your husband knows quite well. And? And, well, he's with him right now, actually. Well, as I said when you first came in... I'm not that familiar with Freddie's business dealings. Is there something wrong, Mr. Wyman? Why do I get the feeling that something is wrong? - Freddie's all right, isn't he? - Well, yeah, sure. He's got his hands full, but he's fine otherwise. You seem so nervous. I'm feeling something else. Well, I do apologize about that, Mrs. King. To tell you the truth, something has happened. To Freddie? Has something happened to Freddie? No, to a friend of mine. Someone who Fred knows. I don't understand. Her name is Miss Dolan. And your husband... Yes? Well, he knows that I know her... and I thought maybe he might have mentioned her to you. I... I haven't seen her in a while. You're confusing me, Mr. Wyman. Ohh, I'm sorry about that. Look, I can see that you know nothing... about Miss Dolan or Mr. McGraw... and I'm kind of anxious, you know... Oh, anxiety is the devil's impatience. Yeah. Look, Mrs. King, I... I'd really appreciate it if you didn't... say anything at all about all this to Fred. He might think I've gone around the bend, you know? No, no. He'd understand. You're friends. Well, a friend in need is a friend to avoid. I'm sorry to bother you about all this, ma'am. - No, no. - Good-bye. Good-bye. I'm thirsty. You? Bellhop says she's still not back in her room. But you said that her clothes were still there. Yeah. So, we know that she didn't leave permanently... if she left alone. Right. "We"? Yeah. You need a dictionary? You and me. That ain't written anywhere. No, Harry, this case is way too spread out. - You need a partner. - You're lookin' at my partner. All right, Harry, fine, fine. You can be the boss. I was just trying to help you solve this thing. Why? Because it's so fucking exciting. Oh, Annie Oakley? Yeah, when there's a gun in my hand. Yeah? Whose gun? I just thought maybe a woman's intuition... could've helped you crack this thing. That's the first time we've touched. I could have gotten much more out of Mrs. King than you did. - I got what I needed. - You got nothing! - What I needed to know. - What? I didn't want to hurt her. Well, sometimes it helps to hurt. She really loves this guy. She said that? She didn't need to say it. - Suddenly you're the expert? - No, you're the expert. You've got something, Stella. I don't know what it is, but you got it. You ever been married, Stella? Yeah, me, either. You know, they say a marriage is the best thing... that's supposed to happen between two people... Or the worst. - Ever want kids, Stella? - Kids? Yeah. Little people running around with your face. I know what they are. Yes, I would like kids, but not now, OK? I didn't mean now. Not at all now. So, who's the man in your life, Stella? Are you gonna call the cops or what? You're still waitin"? Your friend is missing. The guy who might have done it can hurt people in strange ways. Now, either you can sit here and continue to flirt with me... Flirt? Or maybe we can help each other and save someone's life. Or fuck 'em up. Harry, one of us has to fly up north tomorrow. Right. Me. Fine. OK, I will keep an eye on the King house... and the hotel and maybe make some calls. - No. - No? OK, then I will leave first thing in the morning... and you can reach me at the same motel. - No. - God damn you! Look, this guy could be dangerous. Besides that, there's something going on... between Mrs. McGraw and the young ranch hand. Really? It could get sticky, and I don't want you up there alone. Harry, if you were born stupid, you're now having a relapse. I'm going to take the 10:00 am. Plane. This is my phone here, and I also have a service. Stella, listen. You... Good night, Harry. What was that? Comes with the slap. So does this, babe. - Stella... - What? - Come to my hotel tonight. - No. Why not? I'll call you. Harry, come on. Stella, something's happening in a hurry. Yeah, it's a scene. You love a scene. You told me that. - I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. - What? - Yes. You said that you couldn't tell the difference... between a smile and a situation. Aw, well, I'm learning fast. Besides, you got the smile, and this is the situation. Please? Oh. You have to get up in the morning. I have to pack. Then I got to go, and... OK. - Hey, Harry. - Yeah. Good night. Call me, Harry. Why don't you call me, Harry? Yeah. - Stella. - Yeah. It's me... Harry. - Yeah. - Did I wake you? Yeah. Well, what do you want me to say? About what? You know. I have to get some sleep, Harry. - Stella. - Yeah. Let me come over there. Oh, Harry, I don't... I don't think so. I... I have to go to sleep, OK? - Stella. - Yeah. Uh, you just be careful with McGraw, OK? Um, yeah. Yeah, I will. Good night, Stella. - Hey, Harry. - Yeah. I'm... I'm glad that we're partners. Yeah, me, too. Good night, Stella. OK. Good night. What if I said I'm falling in love with you, Stella? What if I said that? I'd look for a sign, Harry. - Hi. - Stella? How you doing? - Marty? - Yeah. Why are you calling me, Marty? Why, you don't want me to? You made it very clear that you didn't want me. Well, maybe that's not so clear right now. Is there somebody else? Uh, yeah. There might be. Oh, that's good. Good. Good, good, good. Mm-hmm. Stella, take it easy. It's been real nice knowing you. Marty, you're an asshole. Yeah. I got a message to deliver, pal. Out. Out! We'll continue this talk later, pal. - The phone's right here. - Oh, thank you. You're at Crooked River Ranch, Northwest Prairie Road. Ah, thank you. Hey, Earl. Yeah. It's about those packages. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. - I'm thirsty. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. God. Thanks for the water, Mrs. McGraw. You're welcome, Art. What is going on? Jim, you're hurting me. And what do you think you're doing to me? Now, something's going on when I'm not here. Yeah, which is most of the time. OK, what are you saying, girl? Nothing. I'm saying nothing. Of course it doesn't help that you're never around. No, except my making a living. I mean around here for me! Look, Ellen, you knew I had another ranch when I met you... so we're not talking about it now. But we never talk! Does Missy know about what you've been... Mm-hmm. Hey, you in there. Are you about done? Yeah. I'm just about ready to hang up. Well, hang up. Yeah, Herman, I'll get you that delivery this afternoon. - OK, bye. - OK. All right, then. Bye-bye. Thanks for the coffee, ma'am. Where are my keys? You were listening. This is none of your business. Well, I see you crying. I'm a woman. That doesn't make it your affair. Follow me, please. - Mr. Wyman is here to see you. - Thank you, Pamela. Thank you. I hope I'm not bothering you, Mrs. King. I'm just doing some weeding. Oh, always healthy to do that... In your garden, in your life. Is that why you came back, Mr. Wyman? To discuss weeding? No, not directly. Then what is it? This is the second time we've met... and the second time I've wondered... what your real motives are for being here. Just honest concern. I know what it's like to be gone from someone you love. Is it your purpose to come here... and cast doubts upon my marriage? Are you really an enemy of my husband's... disguised as a friend? I'm not an enemy at all, Mrs. King. It is all about value, Mr. Wyman... and love is my value... Love for my husband and for my family. Now, please, I'm asking you to leave. The one who loves waits. What are you implying? Are you trying to hurt me? - Are you the devil? - The devil? I love my husband, and he loves me. We are constantly reaffirming this fact... and cannot be threatened by anyone... I'm sorry, Mrs. King. I... I'm sorry! I really am! You're the devil! Here's your peanut butter and cheese crackers... and your change. Hey, Cal. Uh, you can set me up, and I'd like to square up my tab. I got to make a phone call. I'll have whatever he's drinking. Yes, ma'am. Hi, hon, it's me. Yeah. I'm going to be coming home. Thank you. I love you. I love you. Bye. I love you. I love you. - You keep 'em coming, Cal. - All right. - Hey, I know you. - We meet again. Yeah, so we do. Your wife was kind enough to let me use the phone. Well, it's my phone, too. Yes, but I can't tell if you're kind yet. Some people think I'm very kind. Oh, and others? Well, they just don't know the whole story. You know, a man's got to be who he is. I mean, most people, they just go on sleepwalking through life. They haven't got a fucking clue. See, I know who I am... and I ain't going to change, so why not just go forward? Why not just forge ahead wherever it leads? No matter what the risk. Yeah, risk. You got to go out on a limb... because that's where the fruits are. You're a nosy little person, now, aren't you? It's rare that I encounter someone who lives life so fully. Well, you don't know the half of it. Oh, I think I know both halves. What's your name? Stella Wynkowski. Yours? James McG raw. James McGraw. Fits you. Fits you like a king. Like what? A king.. You know, the principal piece in the game of chess. McGraw? I want to talk to you outside. I ain't moving from this bar stool, Arthur... except to fire your coward ass. Well, that suits me fine, because what I'll do is... I'll go back there, and I'll get Ellen and Missy... and you ain't doing a thing about it, all right? We won't be having no trouble here, Art. I'm going to wipe the floor with this piece of puppy shit... and then I'm going to get some answers out of you. Yeah? I hardly think that you're man enough to do either. Watch my hat for me. You don't deserve her. You're never even there. Why would you want to ruin her life? I didn't ruin her life! Why would you hurt somebody if you loved her? Huh? I never hurt anybody. Miss Dolan? - Harry? - Who? You lied to me, Harry. Rick's not married to anybody, are you, baby? - Who is this guy? - Who is this guy? He's just an acquaintance, baby... Someone I thought I could trust. - Hmm. - Get in the car. Harley, I don't like this acquaintance. - Right. - Hey. We'll take care of her, pal. Good. - Are you all right, sir? - Get out of here! Art? I'm driving you and your daughter... to your nearest relative. You got one minute to pack. I'm packed. Where are we going, mom? We're going to the airport, sweetie. Why? We're going to go visit grandma for a little while. What about daddy? Did he go away again? Yeah. He's gone. Why don't you go back to sleep? OK, boss, see you tomorrow. Make it early, Harley. It's already early. Rick, where are you? I'm so very ready. I'm glad you're ready, angel baby... because ready or not, here comes Rick. How do I look? You look... Did you hear that? Only the pounding of my heart. Well, keep on pounding, angel baby. I'll be right back. Harley? Harley? Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! Rick? Mr. Dobbs. Ham! Where is everybody? - Hanging around. Get dressed. - Dressed? Hey! Oh, that bitch. That bitch. Whoa! Hey! Help! Help! Please, Harry. At least acknowledge me. I'm feeling frightened and unloved... Naked to the world. Oh, my God. Jesus, Harry. Well... I had to find out about Rick... find out if he was the one. You do understand? Oh... Is there a chance for us, Harry? For you and me? What? Would we be glad and dizzy all the time... or would we destroy each other? Glad and dizzy? Miss Dolan, get on the train. Harry, please... the truth. Aren't you in love with me? Miss Dolan... it would be as thrilling as winning the exacta... but I'm in love with someone else. May I have your attention, please? The Star Coast Starlight Special, train number 11... is arriving through gate number one. - Good-bye, Miss Dolan. - Gwendolyn. Your case and your ticket, Miss Dolan. All aboard! All aboard! Good-bye, Harry. Excuse me. 533'. You going far? Aw, life. - Remember me? - Jesus. Marty, what are you doing here? Come on, Stella. You know why I'm here. No, I don't. You're not coming in. You are not coming in. Mam!- You know, I've been working hard lately. Yeah. Trying to write, trying to create... trying not to think about you. Go home, Marty, now. - No. - Oh... - Come here. - Don't do this to me. I'm thinking about the way that it was. I want it back. What? Wait, wait, wait. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, that's great. Now you're a goddamn sniper. - Marty? - Yes. You clear your ass out of here now. What if I said that I loved you? I'd look for a sign, Harry. But not what I've been seeing lately. I'd look for some tenderness... sincerity. A sign? What about a whole billboard? And how did you find out where I lived? Like I said once before, I'm very good at what I do. And what are you doing now? Well, I was on a case, but I was following the wrong guy... because the beautiful lady who hired me... was doing the same thing. So, I put her on the train... and she kissed me, and it felt good... but not like the kind that you keep. And then I saw you kissing this guy... and I felt real tight inside. Until I realized... you were solving your case, too. Good. So, what do we do now? What do you think? Right. Think it'll last, Stella? I don't know, Harry. I guess there's only one way to find out.
