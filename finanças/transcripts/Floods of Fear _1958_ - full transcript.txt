[male voice] This was the year of the big freeze. It was late spring, and the snows on the high groud had not yet thawed. Far below along the riverbeds, they built their dykes and reinforced their levees. Then they waited. [dramatic music] [male voice] Damage from floods and storms mounted today as more rain fell on great sections of the state. Further overflows are threatend along the Humboldt River. Here's the latest flood communiqué from Governor Fielding's offic, it reads, and I quote: "The flood crest continues to rise and is now far above the danger level. People living in upstate areas have already been evacuated. People living in the Humboldt Valley are urged to leave their homes immediately. They should take warm clothing, blankets, two days' supply of food, and make their way to the nearest high ground." Let me repeat that. "People living in the Humboldt Valley are urged to leave their home, take with them blankets, two days' supply of food and make their way to the nearest high ground." You jerk. [man] Okay, Jack, double down here. The other stuff will be along in a minute. Hey. Hey, where's the Mayor? Right in the council room, Mr. Murphy. [Murphy] Oh, okay. Go right in, Mr. Murphy. There's a chance we're going to stay dry here in Lebanon. That'll make us the refugee center for this area. And there'll be plenty of them. Dr Matthews? I'd feel easier if our supplies were in better shape. -[Mayor] How does it look to you, Colonel? -As I see it, the two critical points are... here and here on the Humboldt Dyke. Those levels will hold if we've gauged the crest correctly, and it's due this p.m. If we're hit with more water than we calculated, then your guess is as good as mine. -Said you wanted to see me? -Jack, I asked you to come over because we need your tugs, and we need them badly. -What for? -Rescue work. There's more than a thousand people marooned upstate. We've got to get them out. Nothing doing. Look, Jack, we're all on the same spot. As the situation stands, we need everything that will float. -Sorry. -But your boats could mean life and death to a lot of people. Wait a minute. Are you going to open up your bank and let the victims help themselves? -That's entirely different. -Yeah, this is entirely different, isn't it? Now, look, I've got a million bucks worth of stuff on that waterfront and I'm using my tugboats to get it out. [wind blowing] [male voice] Here are some more news flashes from the danger areas. Along the Humboldt River the situation grows more critical every hour. Convicts from the state prisons have been rushed to points where dykes and levees are in danger of being breached by the flood. Armed guards watch over these convicts as they work. The convicts are relieving other workers exhausted by their week-old battle with the river. A communiqué from the Governor's office states that the flood crest is still rising fast. Get out! Let's go! [screaming] Beat it, beat it, she's going. [man shouting] Help! -[men shouting] -[dramatic music] [men shouting] [men coughing] [dramatic music continues] Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! [crying] Help! -Help! -Were you alone? Yes, I was driving home. -Where's home? -Over there, about half a mile. -Can you swim? -No. -Come on, we'll manage. -No, no! Come on, get out of this coat. Take off your dress, too. Come on, you can't swim with that on. Take off your shoes. Let's go. [woman coughing] Here, hang on to that. [bang] Who else besides you lives here? My father. -Anyone else? -No. It doesn't look like he's here. He's a doctor. -[man] Help! -Dad! Dad! [man] Help! Dad! [man] Help! Help! Help! [man] Hey, Peebles. Hey, is that... is that you, Donavan? I thought I was a goner. There's a house over there. Think you can make it? Yeah, yeah, if you can help me. -Well, come on. -[man] Help! -[moaning] -[Donavan] Who's that? Ah, Sharkey. -Is he hurt? -I hope he's dead. Come on. [dramatic music] No, Donavan! Hey, Donavan, are you nuts? Come on back in and leave him there. Ah, let him go to hell and drown! [dramatic music continues] Don't just stand there, can't you see I'm half dead? Go get us a towel or something to dry me off. [coughing] Well, what do I have to do? Beg you? [Donavan] Get some towels, quick. Here, help me rub him. Hard, so it'll get his blood moving. What do you want to do that for? He's a screw, ain't he? Cut it out. Cut it out. You might be crazy. Let him die. Throw him back in. Kill him, kill him. You're in for murder anyway. [dramatic music] [cries] [wind blowing] [dramatic music] You'll be all right, Pop. Hey, Doc, I hear the north dyke's gone. If that's true, we're gonna get a lot more casualties and supplies are getting mighty short. I better go worry the Sheriff some more. Okay. Doc Matthews is here now, Ralph. Well, Doc, your medical stuff is on its way. I can't say I'm not glad to hear it. -That's what I wanted to know. -Good. You haven't had any word of Elizabeth, I suppose? Sorry, Doc, nothing so far. We'll let you know as soon as we hear. Sure. Thanks. [dramatic music] [whistling] -Hi, honey. -No, that's my father's. [laughs] Last night it was, but times change, honey. Ah, come on, come on, give us a kiss. That man. He's in there stealing things. Peebles? The little one? -Please do something. -Where's the other one? -Oh, your head. -Ah, not much. I knocked it against the roof or something. It's my arm that bothers me more. You ought to have it in a sling. No, it's okay. I'll get some water to clean that wound. This'll hurt a bit. Why did that man want to kill you? Peebles? He ain't got no cause to love me. I'm his guard. -He's horrible. -Yeah. He's doing a stretch for armed robbery. And the other? Is he really a murderer? Who, Donavan? Doing life for killing a woman. He strangled her. But if he's a killer, why did he save us? Who knows? He's a funny sort of a guy. He's moody. You can't open him up. I don't get him, I never have. Boy, do you like swimming! It's getting chow time. Well, go ahead. You got the can opener. Fix some for the others, too, but don't start a fire. Now, we'll have to fix this on the roof somewhere, and hope they don't see it. There's bound to be planes and boats out looking for survivors. [door opens] Hey, Screw, keep your hands off the broad. Donavan seen her first. Yeah, getting ideas, huh? And before you make a pass at getting help, why don't you look around and think a while? Where's your rifle? Where's your buddies? You don't have none, do you? There's only you and us. And what'd it cost us to knock you off? You'd be just another stiff floating down the river. Here y'are, honey. Go on, breakfast. Bacon and egg and steaming hot coffee. Come on, give us a smile. Ah, here y'are, Screw. With your stomach, you can eat it, can and all. [chuckles] Did he hurt you? Peebles? I can take care of him with one hand. Who can take care of Peebles? I can, punk. -With one hand, huh? -Yeah. That knife won't help you neither. Well, listen to him, huh? [chuckles] He's got real tough, hasn't he? Well, maybe we better see how tough he really is. Yes, sir. Come on, let's see how tough you really are. Get up, Screw. All right, I'm coming. No, stop that! All right. This time. If that's the way you want it. Come on, let's have it. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! [crying] Shut up. -Stop it! Stop it! -No! Stop it! Do you always cry your way out of trouble? Now, what's with you two? He was rigging up a signal. Sharkey, let's get this straight. I'm clearing out here tonight, after that, do anything you want, until then, stay undercover and keep out of trouble. You won't get away with it, Donavan. You try to make a break, and you'll get caught. -Sooner or later. -Get this guy! Shooting his mouth off like it was nine-foot tall and a gun in both hands. I'm free now, Sharkey, and I intend to stay that way. I am not going back. If you want to stay alive, you keep clear of me or I'll drop you in the river where I found you. And that's a solemn promise. We've got to get away somehow. How? You can't swim, and I'm... [woman] If we keep quiet, they'll let us alone. -Maybe tomorrow we-- -Tomorrow is too late. -They'll be gone. -Let them go. -Why shouldn't they go? -I'm a guard, Miss Matthews. It's my job to stop 'em. But our lives are in danger. Who cares if they get away? People are dying out there, hundreds of them. Who cares if two convicts escape? I do. It's my job. You heard Donavan. They're ruthless. I wonder why he killed that woman. Ah, this dump makes me sick. When do we blow? Go any time you want to. I'm not stopping you. Ah, now, now, you're not sore at me, Donavan, are you? Ah, he was trying to make your dame. You should've let me fix him. Boy, I've got to hand it to you. Six years in the can and first night out you get yourself a broad. -Figuring to take her with you? -No. What, d'you mean you... you don't want her? That's right. Boy, you really are off your nut. Stop it, stop it! Do you have to do that? -Yes, I'm afraid I have to. -But this is my home. If you remember, it just happened to be the first house we came to. [Donavan continues hammering] It's okay, I ain't going to hurt you. I just want to talk, see? And I ain't one to rough up a dame. That's for Screws, and folks to get tough with me. We're okay, ain't we? We can talk. We got all day. We can be... cozy, can't we? And if you call Sharkey, I'll give him what he missed this morning, right in the gut, see? You wouldn't want that, would you? Eh? See, I've been cooped up for four years. You wouldn't know what that's like, would you? You wind up talking to yourself, and all you talk about is... dames. All right, you want to talk to the big guy. Suit yourself, but he's mean with dames. He took a dame's neck in his hands once... Okay... if you want to play it the hard way... [groans] I'll kill him. No, no, you mustn't. No, don't! Don't, no, you... [wood cracking] Well... er... oh, the heck! I... I was just... That little rat was mauling the girl. Well, she's on your side of society, why don't you look after her? I can get a fire going under this. Rags and stuff, anything that'll make smoke. Ssh! They'll do. Maybe I can make a chimney. You keep an eye out. Let me know if anyone comes. Boy, it's a hell of a ship. Just can't wait to get going. Whole towns washed out, and all that stuff lying around, just asking to be picked up. Just because I picked you out of the river doesn't make us partners. I've got my own plans. Do what you like. I know where you're going, Donavan, and I say, don't be a damn fool. Where I'm going is my business. And it's mine, too. I know what you're figuring. You're aiming to go to West Mills. You're going after Murphy, huh? Okay, okay, then we go to West Mills together. And if you've got any sense at all, you'll listen while I tell you why. -Who's Murphy? -Murphy? He was Donavan's partner. It was his wife Donavan killed. Why did he kill her? They were having an affair. She got tired and wanted to break it up, so he killed her. Then why should Donavan want to go after Murphy? What's that? They were talking. I couldn't hear it all. But Peebles got angry. He said Donavan was going to West Mills after Murphy. What else? Then Donavan got angry. Then you came. If Donavan's going to West Mills, there's only one reason. He's gonna kill Murphy. But that doesn't make sense. Donavan killed Murphy's wife, why should he want to go after Murphy? Don't ask me. You'd think Murphy would want to kill him. All I know is if Donavan's out after Murphy, he means to kill him. [helicopter approaching] Come on, get inside. -Where is Sharkey? -[Peebles] What did I tell you? All you get for saving a screw is trouble. Keep an eye on the girl. [dramatic music] Did you find Sharkey? You said to watch the girl. I've been watching the girl. Ah! [dramatic music continues] What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Blast him! Blast Sharkey! [crying] Ah, quit it! Quit it! Quit sniveling. [Donavan] Come on, pull yourself together. Look, no one's gonna hurt you. [dramatic music] [bang] Damn, damn, the house is going! Donavan! The house is going! We're done for. We're done for. We're done for! Help! Damn! Damn, Sharkey! Damn him! Damn him! Damn him! Come on, we better get on the roof. [Peebles] The roof! [dramatic music] Get the food. Grab hold of my belt. [slow music] Hey, Donavan! Donavan! Donavan, come back. I go to hell. That guy ain't human. Hey, he's got us... he's got us a boat. He's got us a boat. Hey, come on, Donavan. Come on. You shouldn't have hired it. Lebanon's three miles to the west. Keep on the tracks. It'll take you right into town. -Come on, get in. -You ain't leaving me here. I'll get picked up for sure. That's your worry. Ah, so it's like what I said. You want to take the dame. I'm gonna put her ashore, but not with you. Then you ain't leaving me... Hey, Donavan! Donavan! Ah, blast you, Donavan! Donavan! Donavan! [suspenseful music] Keep quiet or I'll throw you in the river. [horn] [man] You in the boat, it's okay, we're coming for you. Looters. This is the law. Stop or we will shoot. Lay low. [gunshot] [man] I'll give you five seconds. Keep down or you'll get hit. [man] Right, this is it. [gunshots] [gunshot] Get down. Get down. [dramatic music] I can't get it off her. She's smashed. I'm sinking! [boat approaching] Hey! Hey! Hey, help! Help! Hey! Hey, help! Help! [dramatic music] How d'you come to get hung up on that signal? Oh... I've been walking the railroad trying to get to Lebanon. Didn't reckon on a washed-out bridge. I was near drowned. -You from Lebanon? -No. From the valley? No, I don't come from these parts. I've been working my way across country. Doing odd jobs, farms and such like. Do you live around here? No, I've got a little garage up near Fieldview. -Oh! -Or, I did have. It's a pile of mud now. Oh, you... you ain't a regular, huh? No, no, just trying to help. Most everybody with a boat's a sheriff, these days. Especially since the Humboldt levee broke. Yeah, that was a real bad night. They say a whole lot of convicts was on that dyke. -You hear that? -No, I ain't heard anything. Like I said I... I've been out of town. Say, this is a... a real outfit you got here, huh? A real gutty engine. -She... handle well? -Yeah, she's okay. Do you mind if I try her? Sure, sure. Come on back. Thanks. Go ahead. Try her. -Yeah. -Let her out. [speeds up] [soft music] She's pretty well banged up, but I think I can fix it. Warm these up. We'll have something to eat. Think I can risk a fire. Take those things off and get them dried out. -They're okay. -They're not okay. Take 'em off and dry 'em out. If you want me to get your breakfast, you'd better be more polite. If I'm not? Well, I can easily walk to the nearest highway -and get help. -Go ahead. [birds chirping] -I'm gonna have to have some clay. -Clay? I need it to caulk the boat with. See if you can find me some. Get plenty of it. It won't last for long. I'll have to keep renewing it. Well, I guess you won't mind sharing the same cup. Why did you save us? Killers can't always be killing, you know. Sometimes they need the rest. -You could have escaped. -I still can. It just doesn't make sense, does it? Get moving, I need that clay. Yeah, that's all right. -Hey, that's my shirt. -It'll wash. Why did you kill Norma Murphy? She was my girlfriend. She walked out of me. So I killed her, so they put me in jail. All right? Then why should you want to go after Murphy? Who told you anything about Murphy? It just doesn't add up, does it? Unless you didn't kill her. Did you kill her? -The jury said so. -But did you? Did you? What do you think? What really happened? How did you get involved with this Murphy? I used to run a construction business with my father. When he died, I needed a partner. So I took in Murphy. He'd been the combat engineer during the war. He had a lot of drive and ambition, and at first I admired him for it. He never left the place. I'd go off once in a while and enjoy myself, but not him. He just stayed in there driving. After a while, he and Norma got married. I guess she was in love with him. And you were in love with her? I liked her. -You can even like some women. -But I thought-- I'd known Norma since she was a kid. I used to give her a ride into town once in a while. Drop by the house for a talk. Murphy made out like he was pleased. Said Norma got lonely him being so busy. Then one night I came home and her car was parked out front. I went in and she wasn't anywhere around. Finally, I went into my bedroom. There she was, laying across my bed. She had on a bright yellow party dress. She was just lying there, staring at me. Her eyes all glazed, just like a doll's. She was dead. One of my ties was on the bed, all stretched and twisted. I just picked it up and in walked Murphy with a couple of cops, and a private eye named Hallock. Why? Why should Murphy do such a thing? Because he wanted the Donavan Construction Company. Killed his own wife to get it. Hallock gave evidence at the trials. Said he'd been trailing Norma and me, for Murphy. He cooked up all that dirt about us and it stuck. But why? If this Hallock's a detective, why should he lie? I know. It had me stumped. I couldn't figure it out. Then, yesterday, I found the answer from Peebles. Hallock's agency's a cover for the smartest crook organization in the whole state, and Murphy knew it. It was a favor for a favor. -And Peebles knows all this? -Yeah. Then you've got to give yourself up at once. Don't you see? All you need is for Peebles to tell what he knows. Peebles will never testify against Hallock. He figures he can blackmail Murphy and get away with it. -They're bound to pick him up. -It's still no dice. Hallock's got too many shady friends. If he ever squealed on him, he'd get his throat cut. But you're innocent. We can prove the truth. -Don't you see, you can appeal. -Sure, you can appeal. I spent my last cent appealing. It was turned down. They put me away for no reason, six years ago. There's only one idea that kept me from going crazy and I've never let go of it. I knew someday I'd get loose. I'd walk into Murphy's office all by myself. Then I'll be the judge... and the jury. Donavan, listen to me. Right now you're innocent. You've got a chance. Give yourself up. Sorry, I'm through with prison. Well, escape then, get away, anything. I'll help you. If you go after Murphy, I'll turn you in. -I'll do anything to stop you. -You're a nice kid, -but I can't hear you. -They'll kill you! After I've finished with Murphy, there'll be no reason why they shouldn't. So you just saved your own skin. You cleared out and left the girl stranded with a couple of thugs. Wait a minute, Sherriff, I had good reason. I know Donavan. He wouldn't hurt her, and he'd see Peebles didn't neither. -I'm going back there as soon-- -You're too late. That doesn't wait for you. We had a patrol out there last night. They came on an old boat with a couple of men on it making for cover. They fired on them, but they got away. That was your Donavan and Peebles. The patrol went on to Matthews' house. Only there wasn't any house, just floods. Sir, they just called in from Area Two. Report a craft passing toward Lebanon carrying casualties. Okay, tell Fisher to get some help down there. -And warn Doc Matthews. -Yes, sir. -Matthews? -Yeah. The kid's father has been doctoring here, night and day, hoping for some word of his daughter. They didn't tell him yet. You ought to be the other side of the bars, Sharkey. I told you I'd good reason to do what I did. Donavan's out to kill Murphy, and I'm going to stop him. Donavan's after Murphy? Who said? Donavan. And you can bet he meant it. Now he'll lay low during the day. Then he'll try and shake Peebles. Then he'll try and sneak into West Mills. Abe, have we got a line to West Mills? No, they're all dead, Sheriff. -Then get me a messenger. -Okay. -I must put Murphy on his guard. -Give me a gun and some men. We can't spare any men. Charlie, warn all radio patrols to watch out for a couple of guys in a boat. I'll give a description in a minute. -Give me a gun and a boat then. -We haven't got a boat. There's a helicopter refueling at Hillsdale. Grab a ride on that if you want. Sharkey, if you don't find Donavan before nightfall, come back here. I must get some men down to Murphy's place somehow. I'll find him. Okay, Doctor Matthews, go right on in. [helicopter engine running] [Miss Matthews] Help! Hey! Hey! Help! Let me go. Come on. They saw me. If they did, they'll circle back. [helicopter going away] Don't try that again. [dramatic music] [soft music] What is it? [chuckles] I... I don't know your name. [both laugh] Well, Elizabeth Matthews. Doctor's daughter, age twenty-three. [soft music] Hey! Come on, it's time to go. Where are we going? I'll drop you about a mile below Lebanon. There's a highway there, you'll be all right. -Where are you going? -Come on, get in. Answer me. You're going to West Mills, aren't you? You're going after Murphy. All I want is for you to be free and alive. Look, it's not good. I don't want the life of a fugitive. I won't go back to prison and there isn't anything else. I just have to do what I have to do. [slow music] Please, don't do it, Donavan. Go on then. Kill him, kill him! Then they'll kill you. Is that what you want? I hate you. I hate you, I hate you! [dramatic music] Murphy's construction is just about there. He's got his office on a pontoon, with its own generator, so it'll be the only building lit up. Not just now, Sheriff, I'd like to get going. Well, now John here is the only trained man I can spare. He's got three deputies outside in the truck. There's a sergeant with two men in a patrol boat down at the wharf. They're busy, but they've been told to pitch in if necessary. Thanks. I'm just sorry I didn't get him before it got dark. Good luck and I hope there's no trouble. [John] Okay, fellas. Come on, let's go. Okay, we know about it. You'll find Mr. Murphy in the office. -Up the street and to your left. -Thanks. -Sharkey? -Yeah. We've been told to help out, what's going on? Let's go inside. Well, come on up. All right, when do you expect him? Before midnight, if he's still got the boat. If not, he mightn't show at all. Don't worry, he'll show. Don't worry about that. [loud noise] Listen to that. Every time that rig swings, it costs me five thousand bucks. And there's not a damn thing I can do about it. I could save it if I had a dozen guys. They left me. Every damn one of 'em left me. If you'll just show us the lay out, you can leave the job to us and go on home. Home? Wait home and be murdered, eh? Oh, no, Donavan's coming here first, and that's just where I want to be, right here in the light. Where I can see him and he can see me. You've turned a murderer loose on me, do you know that? Huh? If I have to use this, it's going to be in self-defense. Come on, I'll show you where to put the men. -Hold it, miss. -I want to see the Sherriff. So do the others. Wait at the end of the line. Please, I can't wait. I'm Elizabeth Matthews, it's about a convict. -He's going to kill a man. -What name was that? -Elizabeth Matthews. -Okay, boy. Hang on a minute, please. [indistinct chatter] Would you go in, please? Elizabeth, oh, thank heaven you're safe. Come and sit down, while I send for your father. No, please, listen to me first, Sheriff, -I've been with two convicts. -Yes, I know. One of 'em is Donavan, he's going to kill Jack Murphy. Everything's going to be all right. Sharkey told me. He's down there with some of our boys. If Donavan tries anything, he's a dead duck. No, no. You don't understand. Donavan didn't kill that woman. -Elizabeth-- -He didn't. -You've had a very trying time. -He didn't! Now, sit down and I'll get your father right away. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Elizabeth! [crying] Dad. Oh, Dad, Dad. I thought... I thought you were dead. I've got to go. I've got to get to West Mills. Easy, now. First you have to get some rest. -Then you can get busy. -No. -I've been wishing I'd have another pair of hands. -I can't explain. [Dr Matthews] Elizabeth. That's not for the town hall. -Are you going to West Mills? -Sorry, ma'am. -Are you going to West Mills? -Sorry, lady. No, ma'am. -Going to West Mills? -No, sorry, ma'am. -West Mills? -Sorry. You'd better squeeze in here. Now, if he comes, let him pass. We'll handle him inside. But fire if he attacks you or tries to escape. -You know where the others are? -The boat's cruising around. And the Corporal's up at the intersection up the street. Tom's hid out on that roof up there. Jim's in that old warehouse over there. Okay. [boat approaching] [Peebles whistling] Hey, Murphy. Jack Murphy? Uh? I'm Jack Murphy. What do you want? [Peebles] I... I got news for you, can I come on up? [Murphy] No, get out of here. [Peebles chuckles] I got a flash for you. It's about Donavan. I said, get out of here. You'd better listen, else you might find yourself in trouble. If you don't get out, I'm going to blow your head off. Stop where you are, Peebles. Stop! -Where are you hurt? -Ah... my leg, my leg! -[Peebles groans] -Get him out of sight. You better stay with him. See he doesn't try any tricks. -He's got a bundle of 'em. -Yeah. Hey, where'd you get the outfit? I er... I just run into a guy. He was dead, he was drowned, see? -And the boat? -I just found it. I found it amongst the other wreckage. The guy was floating, he was drowned, see? [loud noise] [gunshot] -Nothing there. -Oh, no? So what made that swirl in the water? [man] Nothing made it, egg-head. Come on now, take her up to the end of the block. [footsteps] Where do you think you're going? I've got to get to Murphy's Construction. Nobody goes to Murphy's Construction. Hey, stop, stop or I'll fire. [gunshots] [man] Get her! Over there. Hey, Jim. What's all the excitement about? How would I know? I can't see anything but the goddamn river. [man] Go down and take a look. [indistinct chatter] -I've got to get to Murphy's place. -Come on, miss. -I've got to see Sharkey. -Don't blow your top. You can't see him. Sharkey's got very urgent business. It's a man's life. I've got to see him. If the corporal hadn't been there, you'd be a goner. -I'd have plugged you. -Idiot! I don't care if you do shoot me, just so long as I see Sharkey. Okay, okay. Put her in with the other guy. I'll go tell Sharkey. Come on. Tell him it's Elizabeth Matthews, -and please hurry. -Yeah, all right, all right. Inside, miss. You come along over here by the fire and get yourself dried out. There you go. -Peebles! -Hiya, baby. I thought you was on your honeymoon. -What did you do with the big guy? -Peebles! You've got to tell them the truth. Sure, sure, honey, only keep away from that leg. You've got to tell them about Murphy and Hallock. Er... who's Hallock? You know who Hallock is, and you're going to tell them. Tell them who killed Norma Murphy. You keep your hands off of me. What kind of a girl is she? A girl. Looks like she ain't had a bath in a couple of weeks. She's driving us nuts. Can I bring her over? -No. -[Murphy] Go ahead. I can look after myself. Says her name is Matthews. -Matthews? -Elizabeth Matthews. Come on. Hey, Jim, what's going on? Oh, some crazy dame wanted a date with Sharkey. You have to believe me, Sharkey. Donavan never killed anyone. If you shoot him, you'll be shooting an innocent man. Peebles can prove it, but he's afraid. He won't talk. He'll talk all right, and soon. He's going to have to explain this shirt. [Peebles] I told you about that, Sharkey. The guy was dead. He was drifting in amongst a lot of wreckage and wood and stuff. What do you know of Donavan and Hallock? Who is Hallock? I said what do you know of Donavan and Hallock? -[panting] -I want the truth. [screams] I'll tell you. I'll tell you what happened. Come on, who killed Norma Murphy? That you, Donavan? [Donavan] Yeah. [Murphy] You got a gun? Eh? [Donavan] No. [Murphy] Well, that's too bad. [Donavan] It won't make any difference. [Murphy] Come on. Let's get it over with. Hey, Jim. Okay, I can see. -Do you think it's all right? -I don't know. I'd better take a look. Jim. Jim. Get back! Get back! Sharkey. Sharkey. Something's wrong.

It's going to be all right. [dramatic music continues]
