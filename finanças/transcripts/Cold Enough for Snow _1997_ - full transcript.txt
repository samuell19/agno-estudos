[gentle bright music] Does the M6 north go to Cambridge by any chance? Cut it out, Harriet. Sorry. Did I accidentally mention Cambridge? Only twice in the last two bloody sentences. Third time coming up? Thank you. So it doesn't go to Cambridge? For Christ's sake Harriet! Cambridge was months ago! Is all this because we're seeing them again? Wallace and... Gromit? I will no longer be made to feel guilty because I didn't go to a bloody university. I don't mention Sandhurst Military Academy every five minutes because you didn't go there. I didn't spend 20 years of my life lying to people that I did. Actually, I wouldn't mind a few months at Sandhurst. She's all right, it's him. The incredible Hulk. We haven't seen them since that day. It'll be just as horrible. You read stuff into stuff, you do. This is us. Do you feel awful? A bit of backache. Nothing too elaborate. No, I mean, you know! Doing what we're doing? Well, it's for his own good, Shani. According to the incredible Hulk, it is. Too cruel to be kind. I do feel a bit [inaudible] even so. Well, that'll be why you've got the backache. Psychosomatic. My left eye keeps closing on it's own. Now, you will try and be friendly won't you? Hang on you're coming adrift. Hello! Lovely to see you both again. -You too. -Very nice. Hugh? Hugh! What? Lovely, all meeting up again. No one said it wasn't. -Hello! -Hello. She doesn't know what we're up to, does she? Young muffin. We told her we were going to rotary lunch in Gloucester. Neil's under the illusion we're visiting his auntie Gwen in Haslingden. All set then? Now to the business in hand. The position, as I see it, is this: for almost two years, ever since her GCSE's, Pippa had worked like the proverbial dervish. Neil likewise. I'm sure. Isn't it Trojan- They've both happily been offered places at Cambridge provided they get three A's in their a levels. Cambridge? Right. In Blackburn, it's always proverbial Trojan. However, since they met at their interview and unfortunately decided to become infatuated. It could be love. No one saying it isn't true love. Since that day Pippa is a changed girl. Neil likewise. Boy. Mooning around all day, marathon bloody phone calls every night, letters, the size of the Maastricht treaty three times a week. She spends hours staring in the mirror. Somehow not with her own face. I caught Neil talking to a lady bird. He said it was an Anglo-Saxon. I caught Pippa kissing a packet of parcel in the utility room. Enough said. [easy going music] [phone ringing] This is a recorded announcement. If that's the ugliest girl in Cheltenham, you've got the wrong number. VT is not charging you for this call. Are your ears burning? Being rubbish by our misguided parents, you mean? Even as we speak. Rotary lunch indeed. They only mentioned they're going to Auntie Gwen's 27 times. It's a auntie Gwen mentioning record. Off hand, can you think of anyone you're madly in love with at the moment? At random, say? Speaking as the dishiest lad in Blackburn? The same. Yes. So, seven weeks to go. Therefore, as from now, phone calls? Absolutely verboten. Letters limited to one, air mail size, per week. And as opposed to flopping about like lovesick Limoges, they sit up straight, open their books and revise, revise, revise. And when they finished revising, they start again. Agreed? I think I can safely say they'll thank us for it. [knock on door] I'll go! I'm nearest. He'll be late. I'll give him a lift. We hope that you will pass the test, and wish you luck in this endeavour. To prove you are the very best and most exceptionally clever. It's just a wish-you-luck, really. All the cards are daft verses. No, no it's brilliant. Puts Gerard Manley Hopkins in his place. Actually, best way to bring good luck in exams is to swallow a live goldfish. But since you didn't even finish your corn flakes- At which point he made his excuses and left. I'll run you in son. I'm off on my bike. -Aye? -No! You'll be puffed in the exams! Can I drive behind you? For fear you'll get a puncture? I miss Wilimina Fluff. Since when? Just now. Well, she's been dead 12 years. You hated her. It's weird isn't it? We had a funeral. You make us all sing, run rabbit run. Good luck, lad. You show him son. Mount Nasura. Mount Nasura. Your father says to tell you to read the questions three times. He even said it three times. Good luck, darling. And you Holly! You all right? All right. Just over 60 seconds to zero hour, and then you can demonstrate to the world what we lovingly call our education system. In front of you there is an envelope. Write down your name and address on it, now. And leave it on my desk when the bell goes. For those of you who can't spell your own name, put a description. For example, Warburton could write: brain dead pillock. In August, they will be posted back to you, informing you of the appalling grade you have achieved. All done? Good. Right, open your exam papers. Read the questions carefully, give yourself time to answer them. Harrison don't sit playing pocket billiards for two hours. Good luck. And remember, there's always a career for you in the SAS. Loyd's financial services. Good morning. One moment please. Yes, Louise? No, in the lou I think. Tea up ladies. That's my job, Mr. Loyd. Ah, but my treat, Betty. Yours marina. Allison. Betty. Joanne. Capel Cure Miles on hold on three, Mr. Lloyd. Oh, let them hold. What about the workers, say aye! [confused and shocked murmuring] It's only for a couple of weeks, until his daughter's exams are over. He was just the same with her GCSE's. We don't mark her papers. Pathetic, isn't it? Please let today's exams be easier than yesterday's. And let her not get mixed up again about Henry the fourth and six because of the one V and the V one. And let her pocket calculator be all right for batteries. For Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. [exclaims] Sorry! No! Me! Me. No me. No really. You haven't done anything. Why are you sorry? I wasn't really looking where- my fault. But I nearly scalped you. Things usually are. Are you all right? Fine! Honestly, I'm just a bit.. at the moment. My daughter's- sorry. Look, hang on two minutes. I mustn't go scalping beautiful young women. I'll buy you a cup of tea across there? Settle your nerves. There's absolutely no need! Honestly I- Two minutes! I've had a big breakfast! A minute and a half! You must have a ticket, love. You never gave me one. I give everyone one. There's givers and takers in this life. You'll learn that. Oh, hang on a sec. Hello? Excuse me! Excuse me, love? You didn't come in. Oh, sorry Mrs., I forgot. Not we're regulars, love. I'll tell you what, I'll take- Hang on his last one's Thursday. That's French comprehension, so four then. How's tread today? Any luck? Oh, it's scratch cards that does it. Not the bottom write out are lucky ever Bevis, can you run us a paint shop? I have to pick up Mrs. Belize Merck. What's wrong with your fingers? Oh, nope. -Ya all right then? -Yeah, go on then. Will you be keeping your finger's crossed? He'l; be in there now, young Neil. Scribbling away. He did Shakespeare this morning. A bit of a piggish Shakespeare. Iambic pentameters, left, right, and centre. Bloody hell! What's happen? He might be banging in the middle of his pudding and that bloody rackets- Hang on. What now? If he can hear that, he can hear us! Talking? No! The engine. I'll tell you what, we'll got back way through town. It's only a mile or two, innit? Funny enough, I tested him on his to be or not to be, on Sunday. He was spot-on. Her teaches are confident she'll get three A's. Daughter doing A levels? Oh, come on. You're too young to have a daughter of 18! It's true, I'm afraid. Well, not afraid, of course. It's very nice of you to- Hang on. Isn't that Spanish colonial? 17th century, in here? Can't be. Unless of course, they're unaware. Excuse me a sec. Is this anyone's seat? Yes. It's my boyfriend's. Got it! After the next bridge we turn right. Or very possibly, left. Brilliant. Or on the other hand, neither. Or on the other hand, both? Or plan B. We do the Van Gogh museum tomorrow, and just do Rembrandt House and Royal palace today. Yeah, but we did the Royal palace. No! There's one in Prague. Unless it's on caster's accord, innit? Oh, flaming Norah. What? From school. It's Barry Tate and Viola Stot. What score does that make it then? 11 from Cheltenham, 6 from Blackburn. And winning 11-6. Should have stayed at home gotten away from it all. Quick., secret escape route none only to Orson Welles. [happy music] It's you two! Hello again. Did you get in? Sorry? Queens. Cambridge. I didn't. Dear Ms. Botley, sorry to inform you. Their loss. I wrote and told him so as well. How did you know we applied to- Mine was interview before yours! Oh, of course. Right! I thought I... Bye then. Would you like me to tag along with you? That'd be great. No, really! At this time? We've work to go to! Do you know where we can find a bulldozer? He's only away three weeks, love. You're not pining, surely to goodness. It's going to take three months. Pining? He said you hadn't to touch anything. I know what he said. He'll only muck it up again. It's less than three weeks now actually. [doorbell rings] Taxi is here, Carmella! For my train! If you see Mr. Loyd, could you tell him I'm out for the day? In Gloucester. Shopping, Just to do a little shopping, really. In Gloucester, with a friend. Man friend, as a matter of fact. Tall, dark and handsome. Only joking. Yes, Mrs. Lloyd. [Mrs. Loyd] So sorry to keep you waiting. Esperanza! Ingrid? Greta? Hershella? Yvonne? Carmella! Oh yes. When you see Mrs. Lloyd, tell her I'm away. For a few days. Business trip. Comprende? Yes, Mr. Lloyd. End of a beautiful friendship? No, I can't get it off. That's what I mean. You sending it back to your boyfriend? It's a wedding ring, I think. Your husband then? No, no. I haven't got either. Their loss. It's not really mine. I found it. That day at Queen's actually. On the floor by the main gate. It's not gold. It's been stuck ever since. It's going green. Actually, I think it might be mine. Are you two married, then? No chance. Do me a favour. Not likely. No. It was my grandma whittles. My mother gave me it. Bring me luck in my interview. Never bought me none. Have you tried soap? Everything. I'll get it cut off when I get home. If you give me your address, I'll post it to you. [men shouting] Oh God, Cheltenham 11, Blackburn 8. -I'm going to sleep, okay? -Hi men. Surprise, soding surprise. This is Shuttlewith, life president of the Blackburn idiot society. Naylor the nerd, so called cause he's a nerd. This is.. Samantha Bodtley. And? Tony Greg from London. Moral support, unfortunately. He's staying at [inaudible] Cheers. That one's Pippa. She's just taggin along with us. Hi. Hi. Hi. Your turn. Hi. Relax! No one knows you're out here. I'm silly, aren't I? Yes, you are extremely. Oh? And if that offends you, hard luck. I couldn't care less. You see, you're silly for saying you're silly, when arguably, you're the most intelligent woman I've ever met. Really? You! I am? And the loveliest. Are you clear on that point? Loveliest? The most intelligent, lovely, fascinating- Not in Cheltenham, I'm not. Oh. Gordon? Stop it. What if someone- I don't care if they do. Actually, I meant to ring you earlier, but I got- I had some errands. Anyway, just to tell you, Pippa rang this morning, to say they're having a lovely time and- 10 minutes at the most. Don't speak to any strange men till I get back. Then you can. Me! Did your husband ever tell you, you have the most musical laugh? It's just a laugh Gordon, really. I don't think he's ever heard me laugh. Sorry, Shani. Anyway, Neil says to tell you he sends his love and.. Shani, do I sound younger? Pardon? Can you tell? Tell, what? Enough said. Nothing has been said. Is it obvious? Is what obvious, Harriet? Harriet? Are you not telling me what I think you're not telling me? He's an antiques restorer. I suppose he'd have to be, wouldn't he? I shan't tell you his name. It's Gordon. I've only seen him once. Twice, actually. Three times all told. It's only platonic. We just have afternoon tea, and things like that. Oh God! The sheer relief of telling someone. Am I terrible? Ooh, shocking. Harriet, can you go back to the beginning again? Right, breakfast. English for a change. What's the Dutch for black pudding? I don't know. [in foreign accent] Black pudding? Jesus. What? Not another from Blackburn? Cheltenham 14, Blackburn 8. I think you get double points for this one. Good morning! Morning, Mr. Lloyd. Small world be better! Micro-bloody-scopic, right? Your face! You heard me mention now Mr. Bruin. Client of mine. Calls me, says he's too snowed under to come trekking over to Cheltenham for the portfolio meeting. So! Stay right where you are, say I. Two days in Amsterdam will suit me fine. So ring, ring, round the hostels for one Pippa Lloyd spinster of this parish. Well, not exactly this parish and thought why not pop in on said Pippa, and show her the sights. Take her out for a slap up, herring or whatever. And well, hey, bloody Presto. And tonight, two tickets for the opera. Didn't think you'd actually like opera. So, good old Amsterdam, eh? [cheery music] And Atherton glances at defined leg and they're rolling two. Just one more for a century. He drives it postman off. They're running three. 102 to Atherton. That's the end of the over. Morning Mr. Whittle! Who batting? Lancashire. Atherton's got his century. Anything for us? Six. February, over the long on. Brings them up to 47. Ta! Shani! Shani! Shani! Shall I get him up? Then he'll be up. Well, it's not bad. Four hours. Kettle's boiling, I notice. Oh not for me love. My belly's a wash. No I mean steaming. You know, with the steam coming out of it. Shani, don't even think- Shh! What? Where's his well-done present? Hello again doomed yet lovable generation. Or as we at [inaudible] put it: bonjour, buongiorno, and guten tag. I sent you nine postcards from Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. No stamps on them, admittedly. Should be about the millennium. Nice time, son? Brilliant. Not to mention massive. Your... Letter's come. I noticed my room's been trashed beyond recognition, by the way. Tidied, yes. Your letter's here. All my clothes have disappeared. What letter? They're hanging in the wardrobe. This one. [women exclaiming excitedly] Holly Roberts got two E's and a D. Oh, go on. She said it's better than she thought she'd get. Oh, good. Nope, we haven't heard yet. But it's lovely of you to call and ask. After all she's not your daughter. Chance of what would be a fine thing? Gordon! Honestly. It is not a seductive speaking voice. It just happens to be the way I speak. That's all. [busy phone line] [phone ringing] Loyd's financial services. One sec, putting you through. Don't go away. Yes! It's Pippa, can I speak to dad, please? Yes, Pippa how can I- I got three A's. Muffin! Oh, muffin! Fantastic! We did it. We only went and bloody did it! The bollinger! It's in the fridge! -Go get the bloody- -I won't go. What? I won't be going dad. To Cambridge. But why? You go what they wanted three A's- That's got nothing to do with it! It's the last place I'd go. Do you have a reason? Yes. I have a very good reason. You. I'm sorry. Anywhere, but there. Ah hell, they're making hills a lot steeper these days. I couldn't think where you'd rode off to. You know, how she frets. And then I though myself: picnic hill. That's where he went as a kid when something sad happened. You know, to be on your own. That's it. Not with a reason, all right. Yeah. Well, I thought you might want somebody to you know. it's a bugger innit? The way it goes. Would have been a bit special though, wouldn't it? Having a bath every Friday in my cap and gown. Two B's isn't bad though. Bloody marvellous compared to some- They don't have baths in their caps and gowns do they? Tradition at Cambridge. It's not, is it? Would have been. I was going to start it. You all right then, son? All told? You know me. Bugger, innit? Aye, a bit of an upset. And I say it's because of George bloody Formby! Who? Whatever his name is! Neil! His name is Neil, as well you know! All this because George bloody Formby is going to exit up. When I rang you, I didn't even know his results! I told you the reason! You're the bloody reason! This is preposterous! You- You deliberately- You jeopardised your entire! Holly Roberts is going to Cambridge! And don't swear, you're not at school now. Holly Roberts isn't going anywhere. She's applying for a job at Sock Shop. Say something, woman. You must do what you want in life, muffin. Oh, thanks. That's a great help. You didn't though, did you mum? What do you mean? What does she mean? Not now, you don't mean, muffin? Not now. Why now? It's a bit late for doing what you want now, isn't it? I don't know what anybody is talking about! What about what I want! Just because I wanted the best for you! Because of one white lie! One bloody day in Cambridge! Only partly! And partly the 18 years leading up to it. What do you mean? Harriet, what does she mean? Is there a university in Exeter? Best thing for colds and flu is Zinc tablets. Chew slowly in the mouth, every four hours. Four hours. And Cod liver oil capsules will do you no harm. I've packed you a bottle. And your athletes foot powder. Foot powder. Now, if you take a shirt to the laundry, which you won't, make sure you haven't left a biro in the pocket or chewing gum. Chewing gum. You say there should be a clock tower on the right? You turn that a clock tower? That tower with a clock on it? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Ooh, and if you microwave a frozen dinner, let it stand for three minutes before you eat it. Otherwise it goes on cooking in your stomach. I wish you hasn't said that. This is us. Big day for you son. Exciting, really. Yup. You all right, lad? Fine. Are you all right? I should have written it all down by rights. On the headings. And if you feel a bit homesick by the weekend, jump straight on a train. Lots of students come home the first weekend. Some come home every weekend. Are my eyes red? Are mine? Both eyes are blue. Both eyes of both of you are blue. This is hereditary and a fact of life and irreversible, unless of course you wear coloured contact lenses. I hate being brave. I do. When you unpack, don't hide yourself away. Make friends. Invite them in for a cup of tea. I packed you a Battenburg. Play them your Beegee tapes. It'll be fun! It'll only be me who likes the Beegees! In the car, Pippa. Are you sure you don't want me to come with? What on earth for? She's with her father. I'll see you at Christmas. Thanks for everything, mum. Bye muffin. Bye. Muffin! Yes? Bye. Bye. Books on the bookshelf, right? Oh yeah, there's a tough one. Neil? Paternal next of kin? Your mattress. What about it? It doesn't matter. What doesn't? Nothing. Look, why don't you just leave this to me? You two go and have a rest. Cup of tea somewhere. I'll be okay. We're all right. No! We like helping. It's better to. Honest. Look after yourselves then. No, house parties in the backyard. I'll phone you in a day or two. We'll write letters. Treat yourself to a new writing pad. I bought one yesterday. No lines. Give us a kiss then. Stingy buggers. Work hard son. Enjoy yourself. All I was going to say was don't turn your mattress on a Friday or Sunday because it's bad luck. [sombre music] Is he waving? He's not even there. Oh. Well, he does right. Harriet? I know it's not Thursday. I just wanted to see... someone. 4C. 5- Ah, C6! That's us! Home sweet home, eh? They're addressed to me? New laptop and printer. I've got a laptop and a printer. Last years. Dad, other people have pen and paper. Pencils and paper. Stubby pencils and paper- And that's a new duvet. Book tokens for textbooks. So that's a hundred pounds to be- Stop it! Stop it! Ms. Jenkins, I presume? No, miss Brewster. Ah, yes. Lin Brewster. This must be Ms. Jenkins here. How do you do I'm Mr. Lloyd? That's Pippa. Hi. I took the Liberty of checking, nice girls. Both at private schools. Her father's an actuary from Norridge. Jenkins is an osteopath and folks. Sound chaps. I've spoken to them both. I'm being a good father for God's sake! What? Just like that? Suddenly one Tuesday afternoon! The VW convertibles too big for a box. That's arriving tomorrow. Primrose. All the hundreds of doctor Spoc's, measles, and whooping cough when they start to give cheek. None about this though, have they? We'll be all right without Neil. No danger. Who you? Mount Nasura! You usually say it as well when I do. As a rule. Oh, just watching the traffic. It was just like her first day at school, really. Except without a brace on her teeth. And not being taken by me. I thought I shouldn't... brand new life starting for her and everything. I thought she doesn't want her mother comforting her. A mother needed a little comfort herself, really. Not that he wanted me to either. All her life he's ignored her and now all of a sudden he's the great- I mean, it was always me and muffin. Muffin and me. Always. You're a sensitive little soul, aren't you? You feel things. You're sensitive- And then I thought, she's free now. She's free of him. Her life's her own. You barely look 18 yourself, a baby. Yet, with the wisdom of- And then I though, well, I'm free too, aren't I? For the first time I can do whatever I want. I can run around Herod's food hall with no clothes on. I can take up parachute jumping. Catch a train to see you. Anything! You're right. You always are. Anything! You're very beautiful. I've never been right. I've always been wrong. And I'm not beautiful. Drivel! What? If I think you're talking drivel, I'm damn well going to say so. End of story. If you never want to see me again, fine. Goodbye. I'm not sure I'm going to be any good at this. It's 20 years too late, and I wasn't much good then. I don't think I packed her hot water bottle. Would you like to go to bed? Yes, please. Very much. [snoring] Good evening, I have a reservation, the name's Lloyd. Certainly Mr. Loyd. Three nights in total? Just till she settles in, sort out her teething troubles. I'm sorry? Three nights, yes. Initially, she wanted to go to Cambridge, but I insisted on the best. Exeter is my Alma mater. Why can't I come home? I have given it a tough, I've been here for three hours. Unpacking, crying, trying to find a phone. There isn't anyone to talk to! They've all got friends! [shouting] How are ya? So, discussing the life and art of Andrew Marvell, or what? Some of the piss artists from the next floor. I don't know their names, most of them seem to be called dickhead. Just after a few jars down the union. Go on, go for his kneecap! I thought the big plan was that we'd go for a veggie burger and then help each other -put our posters up. -Come on we will! We will! I'll only be an hour or two. Ah, I see. Okay, then? Fine. Mum? Hi, its me again. Just in case you'd been trying to reach me and couldn't get through. It isn't an excuse! Well, let me come home then. Guten tag. Sorry, it's evening isn't it? Guten abend, then. Tony Greg. The man from Amsterdam. Hi. Your turn. My turn for what exactly? [sombre orchestral music] [crowd cheering] It's a sort of herring bone. A ticket would have worked wonders. You know that it is don't you? Stuck in my Stephen King to keep my place. Yeah, he's a bugger like that, Stephen. Why aren't you at the match? You're supposed to be at the match. 6.50 love. There ya are. Oh thank you. Bye. Well, mystery man. Thought I'd keep you company for a bit. You don't have to fret about me you know, Bevis. Nothing preying on my mind. In fact, this your day off from me. I'm not keen on going to be honest these days. I wasn't in the mood somehow. Without him? What Alan Shearer, you mean? Hey, we have a decent team without- No Bevis. I don't mean Alan Shearer. I'll make you a brew. We used to have hot Bovril halftime. I'm afraid we don't run to hot Bovril. What will you take? Heather wants to know, do you fancy a cuddle on the hoffman press? Well, the thing is- I'm on a double yellow line. Can I help you Madam? Do you have these in black? They are in black. No, I mean, in my size? What is your size, Madam? Well, my sister's size actually. I have a sister. In Harrogate. And what size is she? My husband. Well, sister's husband. Brother-in-law. Does he know her size? No. He's Norwegian. I'll take these instead, please. Would you like to set the table for me love? Right you are. You're doing it again! What? Wandering off when my back's turned. You said you'd set the table. Oh right- Now you mean? Oh no, I just thought I'd watch telly techs for a bit. You know, weather forecast, winds fresh to moderate, Pharos comedy, German bite. The table first, eh? According to Heather's sciatica, it's cold enough for snow. What? With our Neil and that, you mean? Neil? That's what you said. It's cold enough for snow. And then you started debating that tale about Eskimos traipsing off into it to curl up and die because they'd no youngins to bring up anymore. You know, in Cambridge, last year at his interview. I often say it's cold enough for snow, Bevis. It's something I say. It don't just have to be in Cambridge. Anyway it's Heather, not me. I wasn't even thinking of our Neil. Yeah. Me neither, that's what I'm saying. You know, if Labourer won the 1983 election and got the north sea oil, they'd have been the ones in power for the last umpteen years. Yes, love. Have I mentioned that before? Just about once a week for the last umpteen- Surprise. Oh, god. Dad, why? As if I don't know. Oh, some commercial proposition exit I might go. I'll pop down a couple of times a week, chase up the chamber of commerce, make a few contacts, sniff out the local money, city council, university- University? Oh, it's time we branched out. Oh, god. [Bevis groaning] Bevis? Bevis? I was just- I was just singing. And shouting. Twist and shout. [Bevis crying] I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Just cry it all away. I cry myself dry sometimes. Empty. That's good. Nobody hears me though. It don't matter if they do. In the car on my way to work. Sometimes I put my wipers on. I think it's just a little bit of flu, you know something like that. I think I'm a bit run down. Probably, yeah. Dark night. Were you in his room? Who's? No, no, I was just- I was just studying a sort of style. I just thought I'd make a bit of a tinge, really. Liven the place up a bit. [laughing and crying] Let's go down then. Have a nice cup of tea. In a minute. I'll just hold you, eh? For a minute. I'll just hold you. That stuff about Labour and north sea oil isn't the only one, is it? Popping up in my head? All of a sudden, for no reason. Bervis, finished with your paper? I've a whole daft list of daft thoughts. Stuck in there hiding. Bevis? Queuing up for their turn. Hello? Commander to base, commander to base! Teddy to zombie! Have you finished your crossword? Yes. Well sling it over then. Jesus, if you want to do it. You haven't done one. I couldn't find my pencil. There. Yeah, I know. Well, I thought you said- Well, go on then. What? Your bloody pencil! Right. You know what's the best thing about working with Bevis? Say no. No. There's never a cross word! Do you get it? Crossword? Good, innit? Bloody hilarious really. [laughing intensifies] It's not that bloody hilarious. -[manic laughter] -Bevis? It's not funny! Give over for Christ's sake! [laughing dies down] Thank you. Bloody hell! Ignore him! You laugh as much as you want. I don't want to. Go on, it's a free country. I don't want to now. Nice up and down will do you fine. Good, good, good. Yes, yes, yes. Well-played sir! Closer than I thought. Much. No, it's perfect. You allowed for the slioe beautifully. I'm going to give you that one. Your match old man. Thanks. So, how do you think young Pippa is getting along then? Academically? Essays up to scratch? Pippa? Yes, my daughter Pippa Lloyd. I don't have a Lloyd in my class. First year English. Ah, no I don't do first year, you see. Oh, well, it's fine, no matter. Not important. The game's the thing, eh? Is it going to take long, do you reckon? [nostalgic music] That's enough! Enough footballing, your teas will be ready! Neil I shan't tell you again! Get in and get your knees washed! What's he on about? There is no Neil! No Neil, no I don't mean Neil. Who the heck do I- No, I mean some other... Bevis! In now before I [inaudible] off! Bevis! In now! There's no Bevis neither! We've been hanging about nearing enough two hours. The RAC said... No Bevis? What ever happened to Bevis then? Where's Bevis? I'll give you another. In the boy scouts. A trip to Pendle, wanting to strangle Mickey Swan cause he'd got some ice cream left and mine were all finished. And all them years since, it's still in me head. Every couple of months or so.. Bingo. Mickey Swan's got ice cream and I haven't. It's stupid. Give you another one. Why are the letters of the alphabet in the order that they are, and why shouldn't it be A, B. C, O, C, P, E, F, Z? What are they doing in there? Thinking them, over and over, all my life. Same daft little list. Now in the room on Jupiter except he's hundreds of years older- what's it mean? I don't even care what it means. I never bloody did. So why bother thinking it? It would be 2001 in real life. And I'll be hundreds of years older. With nowt to show from. Go to work, come home, go to work, come home, fix the light in the attic, get a pair of shorter laces for Neil's trainers before he breaks his neck. I will tomorrow. Oh, hang on. That was his first pair. Dim and distant past. And that's it. All passes doesn't it? Everything. Dim and distant. Gulf war? What Gulf war? It's all forgotten. All the famous men and women. Great geniuses, all the heroes changing the world, and all the millions of heroes we've never heard of. Done stuff that no one ever knew. And never will know. So, what about them? Live's gone with nowt to show. What about them? Bevis Whittle. Nowt to forget because there was never nowt to remember. [sombre music] Bevis? [mysterious music] What are you doing? What? I slipped, I was just- -Come on love, come here. -I woke up and I- Geez, I'll run you a bath. Back in bed. I'll get you a pair of fresh jims on, I'll make some hot water bottles, hot drink. It'll get you better. Everything, better. Things will happen. I'm not the wicked witch of the north for nothing. I'll make them happen. Good lord, to what do I owe the honour of- Shouldn't Ms. Reed have gone to collect my lunch? Anything wrong? I was just passing. Thought I'd pop in and say- No, I was just grabbing a bite between meetings been nonstop all morning. Come in, come in, come in. How much do you need? What? Is it cash? Not cash. People. People? What kind of people? I can't think of a suitable adjective. Lecturers? Men. I knew there was a word for it. George Formby? Otherwise known as? Oh, whatever. Nigel, Norman, Neil. Well done. No, not Neil. I haven't seen him all term. It's no one you know. The tulip of Amsterdam. And he's upsetting you? No, not really. Ignoring if anything. It's nothing, nothing. I just get a bit fed up, that's all. Everyone does, it's midterm blues. It's just- it's like one minute it's undying love, and the next I don't exist. Men can be like that. My very point. Taking things for granted. Other people. Or who seem to. They don't really mean to Pippa. They do feel, what other people accuse them of not feeling. It's just that... it's just that they- they don't get round to showing it. That's all. For three whole bloody weeks? Oh, sometimes longer. Sometimes... sometimes 18 years, some chaps. Can I have some of your pizza? Oh, certainly. You look fabulous. I look terrible! I had my hair done yesterday- I thought so, it's gorgeous! She made an absolute pig's buttock out of it, and the colours all- No, the colour particularly is terrific. Do you like it with bits of bacon and tomato rolled into it? Sorry? Just now, on the train. Some oath tripped in the aisle and squashed half his bacon and tomato roll on my head. And quite honestly, I think I'd like to go straight back home. Harriet, you see there's your sense of humour. Humour in adversity is one of the most admirable- Gordon! I don't have a sense of humour, in or out of adversity. I'm not beautiful, my hair isn't gorgeous. And I'm not any of the things you say I am. Worst of all, I'm not even me anymore. I can't be what I'm not. I don't like what I am, but at least it's me. And if I'm all that marvellous, what am I doing with you? I'm sorry, Gordon. Goodbye. Do I get a goodbye kiss? From the most beautiful lips in the world? Gordon, they're just lips! Chapped ones! Don't ring! Bevis is having a lie in. Still a bit off colour, is he? A bit. That didn't look so happy with itself either. I know. I thought it best not to stick it through your letterbox. It's addressed to Neil. Just the one, is it? John Crawley. Singled a third man. Right. Just Neil. No sir name, please forward. Not in that state you can't. Well! Best one in the world! It is, isn't it? It's what? I gave it to him last year; what's it doing in- Dear Neil, one lost ring enclosed as per promise. I hope all is well... you see? It is hers. Only cut. Who's. All well in Cambridge, if that's where you are. I'm in college in Wolverhampton, so I can still live at home with my mom's cooking. Isn't there any college in Blackburn? You should have applied there unless you can't stomach your mom's cooking. Cheeky bugger. Still, their loss. Yours, sincerely, Samantha Bodily. Miss. What's up? That's where she used to do her office cleaning, isn't it? Who? Grandma Whittle. Wolverhampton? Blackburn college before it were a college. Years back. That big building on Blakey More. Oh, it makes me feel funny. What does? Her very ring. Inside the very letter, that's talking about the very place- Isn't it just coincidence? Sort out any customer's for me, will ya? Where are you going? I shan't be 10 minutes. Can I help you? I'm not sure, to be honest. Sounds crackers really, but I was just looking for a sign. What sort of sign? The prospectus you mean? That one? Yes. It could be, couldn't it? Who knows? Thank you very much. You'd enjoy it, Bevis. There's all sorts. There's motor vehicle maintenance- Shani, I've been doing motor vehicle maintenance for the last 26 years. I don't like it, I bloody hate it. There's computer technology, engineering, there's hundreds of them! Sports science! Modules include PE, recreation management, referee- Shani! Go on! There's everything! Part-time courses, two years, three! Are you looking? Shani! You can take your GMVQ's, Air levels diplomas. You can get a degree! Like Neil. Shani love, I'm too old for the knacker's yard. Let alone night school. It's not night school, it's proper college. Mature students! It's something fresh to do in life. You know like Neil is. When he was little, he copied us. That's how kids learn isn't it? We can learn from him now. I mean I could enrol. Keep you company like. Oh, there's, there's, there's, there's catering! There's, there's, there's hairdressing, there's cultural studies. Where's that? Yeah, modules include rituals, myths, superstitions... Omens. You see! That's a bloody omen in itself. We could go together, of an evening. Maybe have a spag bol, or something, after. And you'll- you'll come to life. It's worth a go. Neil would be proud of you. I would. You would. Please get better, Bevis. Don't, love. Sorry. Sorry. Come on. Nice pictures. [uptempo music] You stupid moron! Are you tired of living? You stupid bloody- Hi. Hi. Sorry about that. Me too. Nice. Thanks. What you doing driving it on your tod, it's got L plates. Just thought, while no one was looking. Including you. Including me. I take my test in two weeks. Oh, you'll walk it. You reckon? You might be better off walking it than driving it. Thanks. So, how are you doing these days? Brilliant. You? Yeah. Massive. How's what's his name? Ask every girl in first year Geography, they know better than I do. Oh, sorry. That's cool. Right. How are all your fellows then? The ones all called Dickhead? We formed a band, do the odd gig. Guess what we're called? The dickheads? Got it. We get a bit brassed off with each other, actually. I'll see you. Right. When? Pardon? Do you fancy a jar? Lunchtime in the union? Hang on. Half a jar? Half a jar between us? Straws are on me. So? Weird woman kissing even weirder man. Read the back. Your mother is having an affair. She was seen virtually doing it in the railway station. I thought you should know. Well-wishes. It's from Holly Roberts. She used to be at my school. I know her handwriting. Your mum? That nice mum with a handbag? I dunno, I mean the minute I left Cheltenham, they both gone barking mad. Got a busy night, have you? Essay, sort of date, and a driving lesson. Right. You? Two essays, three tonnes of ironing, and a rehearsal with the Dickheads. Okay. Is that yours, or mine? Half each? What time can I see you then? About eight? Neil. Neil? Christmas. Sorry? The Christmas vac. Great timing. I want you to come home to Cheltenham for Christmas. We've got a creaky floorboard on the landing, but I don't care. Cheltenham? My mother would through the mother of all wobblies! She's kill me to death. She's been billing King Edwards for weeks. She's contemplating stuffing a Turkey with fairy lights. Bring her. Bring both of them. They'll just say no. Come to think of it, so will yours. Very loudly. They can't, any of them. If I tell mine, I shan't go unless you're all invited and you tell yours, you'll go alone, unless they all come with, then they have to say yes, whatever we ask. Otherwise, they'll think they'll lose us altogether. They can't win. Well? You're on. I don't know what drives them to have kids in the first place. Me neither. Then there was the guilt. And the sheer bloody effort. Not to mention the train fairs. Such a relief, it's over. I'll tell you something, now you look younger. Did you... Did you um...? All the time. You didn't? Nearly once. Ah, so you and Mr. Loyd? I mean, it's not like it's a case of separate beds or anything? I've gone right back to being 18 in the ladies at the maca ballroom. Trying to stop me bra from digging in. It's been separate beds for a long time. Oh yes, well...yes. It's cooler in the summer I expect. And in the winter and all really. It's not easy being a woman, is it? I reckon it's not that much of a doddle being a chap either. No. Bottling everything up. Do you get much in the way of road rage, in Cheltenham? Every day. Mostly from me. He doesn't bottle anything up. Oh well. I happen it's just Bevis then. Oh? I thought he seemed in great form? Now, yes. Well, from the minute Neil walked through the door, really. Mind you, he had a belting assessment from Mr. Barry at the end of term, that's his tutor. And 77% for his project on premiership referees. No? Yeah, I am- I scraped a B plus for me last essay. Not that my course is much easier than his, you see. Nothing's burning, is it? Oh! Is there an off licence near by? Hmm? Well then if you sink or fall before we sit down, rest of us can make do with lager. I'm just a bit on edge. You know, Christmas, it's traditional. Is it with me being here? Course not! Creaky floorboard? No. My mum and dad? No! Doesn't leave anyone else. Yes it does. What do you mean? I don't know. Cheers. [laughing] Cries of good old Neil's dad were heard to run the air. You don't tell him stuff about me, do you? All the various exploits. Stuff you told me. Or I'll regale them something rotten I do. You don't? He just said! Not about me I hope? Both of you! Mostly dad if it's about sport. Oh, and none of them had an answer to your order of the alphabet thing. And one of them is a second year linguistics. They don't want regaling about me for heaven sake, do they Hugh? And you have your own lives to... banding my name all over the university! Do you Pippa? Tell your friends about me. Well, I've no need, have I? You've already told them everything there is to tell. Dad's been treating us to a Chinese once a week. In Exeter? Socialising, you understand? Helping her settle in, meet the right kind of people. What, in Exeter every week? I think she, she values it. Looking after her, giving her my time. After all, that's what fathers are for. Well, yes. Sort of. Well, no, actually, isn't it more what husbands are for? Sorry. Look you know, the first term is always weird. Everyone freaks out a bit. Me and Neil didn't even- Neil and I, dear. I think. Till about three weeks ago. I and Shanie have been all right. What did you mean Pippa? All I'm saying dad, is that I'm okay now on my own. I don't need looking after anymore. Husbands are for providing Pippa. Ceramic Hobbes, use of the range Rover, letting them make hair dresses, rich. Giving. Tokens of appreciation, respect. Are these things supposed to have the consistency of cannonballs? Oh, to hell with it. She is having an affair! More turkey, anyone? White meat or dark? Well, I wouldn't decline an extra portion of- [Loyd laughing] Don't be ridiculous Pippa. Holly Roberts saw her. Would you pass your father the gravy, please Neil? Why is it ridiculous, Hugh? Well, if you can't see why. I'd like you to tell me. Women who have affairs are... well, they're not like you. Oh? What are they like? Oh, they're like... they're like... they're like women who have affairs. Look is this some sort of Christmas party game, young lady? Charades? Some kind of childish- I suppose it is some sort of game. Exactly! That's exactly what it is! If you say so, who am I to contradict? Good. So, is the Christmas pud ready then? With lashings of Brandy butter? If you say so, dear. I'll give you a hand. No, no, no! She can manage, can't you Harriet? If you say so, dear. Oh women, right? Right. You know the best way to change sex? I read it in a book in the college library, under myths and superstitions. You have to kiss your own elbow. I mean, you can always kiss the other one to change it back. Well, it won't reach. I think that's the idea. I'm sorry, mom. I'm not. Pass me the sauce pud, darling. Good girl. Very good girl. It's all a matter of letting go, you see. You'll excuse me for imparting advice, but we have to wave them a fond farewell. Let them get on with their lives, while we get on with ours. Refill anyone? Oh, I could have got that for you. No, no, it's Christmas. That's what I mean. You just talk your men's talk. Harriet? We'll play a proper game shortly, as trivial pursuit or something. Just the four of us. The kids can go out and do whatever. Incidentally, just out of interest, not important. Holly Roberts is a born liar. Her father is a solicitor. No one in Cheltenham would believe her. So, I think we can ignore the whole thing as if it never happened. Which it didn't. If you say so, dear. Absolutely. [horns playing] Pippa, for God's sake we're late! Well some things can't be rushed. Today they can! She had to have ten minutes each side. [listing students names] [listing students names] [listing students names] Shani Alsace-lorraine Whittle. [crowd applauding] [Neil shouting] This is going to be of Shani, mainly. Shani mainly, all right. Shani mainly! Smile. Ready? You come in this one, give that chap the camera! Would you mind? Is that all right? Ooh! Very academic. Are you ready? [sombre music]
