Sorry. Hello? Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in there. Oh, god it's mine, I left it here. Have a nice day. Sure, thank you. What a shithole. Oh, fuck! There. Where is she? Hey it's Kennedy, where's Valerie? Well, can you get her? Thanks. Hey, what are you doing girl? That sounds fun. Er, get your shit and get packed, we're going to the cabin. Why? Why not? I already called El and Davis; they're they're on their way. You need to get away. We all need to get away and this is the perfect weekend. So get your shit, shut up. I'll pick you up, 11. That's not gonna work for you? Well it's gonna work, so just make it happen. Yeah. I don't, I don't care what they have planned. This is more important. Tell 'em to fuck off and we'll be good. All right, 11. All right, all right, I'll see you then. Bye! - Oh good. - Yeah. If you push me down, you're fucking dead. I'll push you from behind. What are you laughing at, I can get you too. I'll bomb you off this damn cliff. - After bowling. - Oh yeah. I know. Let's just stay here, it won't be a problem. - Oh. - Great. Hah, are you the king of silver mount? This is so cool guys, then why don't we stop here? Well, we wouldn't stop here if hitting the green slammed that tumble. Look at this, it's redneck one shot. Tell you what, 15 bucks you land it on that cushion down there. Right, sell that for 17.50, that's a deal. Why are you breaking my balls, man? I'm doing nothing, keep it. 15 bucks is a good deal. 15 is a good deal, 17.50 is a better deal. What are you gonna do with 50 cents? You can't even buy a popple. That's $2 and 50 cents where I come from, boys. Well, I guess you could hit something there. Oh, what a beautiful shithole. It's pretty gorgeous, nice and rustic. Nothing rustic about it, it's a giant shithole. There's a broken couch. People come here and dump their trash here. Why are we here? Well, we could set it on fire. Probably dump more than trash here. There's bullets everywhere. Like, what are we doing? You almost hit the bucket, what, uh-oh. You going again? Yeah, I'm going again. Uh right, I nicked it, I nicked it. If you didn't nick that bucket, tonight you'll be nicking a few beers and everything at the party trumps all of this. - It better. - Debbie, don't. Have I let you down before? No. Do you really want me to answer that? Well, not this year, but... Where the hell's Theresa at? Her grandma, for the weekend. I dunno, probably just needed a break. The year's been weird. Man, what are you doing? I thought it was you, that ain't me. What's so weird about it? I don't, I don't know. I just feel like every, every second someone's two steps behind me. Like, I feel crazy. Like, I feel like somebody's watching me. Is it Rockwell stuff? Women's shower? I'm afraid to wash my hair! - Really guys? - Oh, come on. - I'm being serious. - I know, you know, you know the old form, we're just playing. Well, maybe when you've had a few beers, you'll take my story seriously. Oh, there's gonna be a few beers. Gonna be a few tears coming from the beers. And our beards, and your beard, it's possible. Fuck off! - Oh, shit. - Oh. Nice day for a trespass, ain't it. - The cops. - Us? Yeah, sure. We're just hanging out, sir. My guess is you haven't heard the story of little Sallie Mae Cortez; came up to the quarry on a day about like this, nice sunny day. Playing down here with her tin cans, ball of foil. Her dad was a popular crop duster, ain't money to crop dusting, boys. She's down here by herself, no one around to hear her scream. She slipped, heard a rattlesnake, fell. Say all that was left of her, the bears got. If you think it's fun to come down here and fiddle and fuck around, you think about little Sallie Mae. - Whatever. - He's crazy. Oh, wow. Are you serious? That's not a joke? Guess the hell if it is, I don't see what's so damn funny. Something, something funny around here, Chris Elliott, you got some jokes to make? Man, I just... What about you, cock Nick? We're up here at the quarry, having a good time. Here you come. What the fuck's your name? Summer's Eve? That's funny to you? You're funny man. - What. - That's funny. You wanna know how to shut the fuck up? You want to know what else is funny? This right here. That mean anything to you? Seen a badge before. Well, it means a hell of a lot to the state. So does trespassing. There's no signs up here. Son, I will fucking bite your tongue right out of your mouth. Guys, wait time's over, the time for fucking off is right now, I can arrest all three of you, fucking dicks. I'm not going back to jail, man. You'll go back, if I say you'll go back. Look sir, we'll leave okay. No trouble. We'll leave, okay. - Yeah. - Let's go. That's great, that's great. I can't wait for you to get- - Actually guys, we should, yeah, let's just go. Actually guys, you should yeah, you should go. Come on. We don't want any trouble. Okay, let's go, come on. You don't want trouble? Too late. Go and put some eyeliner on some more. Back there. Come on. Come on. It's my quarry. I would like you to take the word of God, please, and turn with me in the Old Testament, to the book of Isaiah, the 45th chapter. I'll begin reading at verse one in Isaiah 45:1. - $13.80 - All right. All the miracles that He performed. They heard Him say, "Take up your bed and walk," then the lame man walked. Thank you. They experienced the blind man to be able to see. Then Jesus looked at His disciples and He said, "Man, there ain't nothing you can do more than that." Hit me, just a minute for me, okay. Than to say, "Take up your bed and walk." I've given you the power to alter... "I have holden, subdued nations before Him" and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut. I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight. I will break in pieces, "the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron." "Thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name..." "For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect ..." Everything all right here, citizens. Yeah, we- - I wasn't talking to you! Everything all right here? Yes sir. Keep that away. Okay, having a good time here... Have a good day. Look, we can't do anything in this stupid town without being caught. It's, it's just luck. Yeah, he's everywhere, he's the only thing they've got. Let me give you some advice. What have you got? You all be careful out there. All right. Go on, run. Then verse 21. "Tell ye, and bring them near;" yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? Who hath told it from that time? Have not I the Lord? And there is no God else beside Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside Me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: "for I am God, and there is none else." Booze is here! I'm sure you alerted all those ball bears. Well, ball bears don't go kicking cans in the quarry. Hey, we're here, boys! Did I hear someone say, "Booze"? Been a long time since we hanged out like this. Yeah. - Well overdue, boys. - Got out of the city. I'm just glad to be away from the kids for a little bit. Ain't that the truth, not much. Huh, right, like you have a kid. Well, never will. To take care of. That was your first and last mistake. Well, it's not a mistake that I made, I'm not sure about the first. Well, I think we've got bigger things to worry about like bald fish. Well, ball bearing kids kicking the cans. What was that? Was that guy for real? He's real, he's real. Like, what if all the cops around here are like that? That's what happens; you grow up a dick, you gotta be a dick to be a cop, so you can be a bigger dick, push around the little people. It just seemed like he didn't give a shit. - Well. - Oh, he didn't give a shit. - Well. - Think we're on twos. Not only being here, finally getting out, away from the kids, away from the store, away from job. I'm gonna toast throwing that fuck cop in the quarry. Hell, fucking hell.
