Oh... Motherfucking Kirby Leto! Son of a bitch! What the hell? Hey! Clap on! I said, "Who's there?" I may be old, but I can kick your ass. Ow! Ugh! Please have issue 15. Please, God, have issue 15. You the comic book dude? - Uh, yeah. You Eddie? - Yeah, that's me. Uh, the Spyder comic, issue 15. You got it? Yeah, I got it. I keep the valuables in the box in the back. Let's look. Uh, this is not the book. You callin' me a liar, you little son of a bitch? You sure? It's a comic book, isn't it? Found a Benjamin! Out late, huh? Seeing someone on the side? Only you, Jenni. Right answer. I got the caterers scheduled, and my dress is killer. Hottest bride ever. I know, babe. I can't wait to be in Hawaii, on the beach with the man I love. Yeah. Hawaii. Packer, thanks for your help on the flash Apple X order. - I got a nice bonus. - Oh, that's good, Liz. Uh, Miss Connors. Uh, any bonus for me? I'm sure they're considering it. But this, lunch with your friends, really shouldn't be happening anymore. It's hurting your chances to move up the company ladder. I'm just looking out for you. - Thanks, Miss Connors. - You're welcome. Is that your new boss? Dude, she's hot, man! I thought you said she was a reptile. -Yeah, she's, uh, probably reporting to HR right now. -Oh. Seven years I've worked here, and everyone gets promoted but me. Obviously, man, you gotta stop inviting your buds over for lunch! Quit slacking, dude. What are you thinking? So, you gonna tell me what happened? Did Jenni pop you? Did Jenni pop you? As soon as you tell me how you and Wendy are separated but still live together. The eye, Packer. What happened? Eh, collector's hazard. -Couple guys jacked me. -What? It was my fault. I got greedy. I mean, I hid the money, but they knew what they were doing. Wait, are those the guys that said that they had Atomic Fiction issue 15? -Mm-hmm. -The first appearance of the Spyder, right? -The Holy Grail. -Oh, my God... So... how much did they take? Let's just say it was an amount you could honeymoon in Hawaii with. I'm sorry. You know you're screwed, right? I mean, you know you're screwed? I mean, Jenni is really gonna pop you now. I mean, for real. Any chance you could make a small loan? Yeah, but you sell your comic collection first. A micro loan? Packer. When you gonna quit this addiction? -It's not an addiction. -Yeah. You know how important the Spyder is to me. He's my hero. Got me through my mom's death and my dad's anger. Wasn't your dad's anger really him tossing out your comic books? Yeah. That hurt more than his fist. I don't know. Spyder's a part of me. -Just like my-- -Penis? You were gonna say penis, ri-- Awesome. Great. Thanks. Oh-- oh, my God. Well, it's the part that Jenni's gonna lop off when she finds out how much you lost, that's for sure. Seriously, man, when are you gonna quit chasing fool's gold? Because Lord knows these comics aren't making you rich. Look, it's my only way out of this shitshow job. You know, I can't be poor my whole life. I just need one score. One big score. You know how much high-grade comics go for. Don't you think it's just a little ironic that you work in the paper industry, and you wanna escape to the paper industry? And now you lose all your wedding money? I mean, it's like you are the Spyder. You know, it's one step forward, two steps back. -I can already hear the lecture from Jenni, too. -Oh, yeah. -Gonna demand that I change, again. -Mm-hmm. -I guess I have to. -Hmm. So, how can the Spyder not be the Spyder? Oh, shit, you're not supposed to see me in this dress! -It's bad luck. -That's a silly superstition. -What's this? -My beautiful face? You got in trouble again. Your comic collecting? Ah, it's nothing. Nothing, my ass. Your eye looks horrible. The wedding photos will be shitty. Look, it wasn't my fault, okay? I got rolled on a few nights ago. And? And they took some money. - The honeymoon cash. - Are you insane? It was my chance to quadruple it, okay? If they had had the fuckin' Atomic Fiction 15 -like they had advertised-- -When are you gonna grow up? We're three weeks from our wedding and you do stupid shit like this? Look, I'll get the money back, I promise, okay? How? Buy more comics and hope they appreciate? Yeah, that actually could work. Get the hell out. And take that fucking comic collection with you. You-- you don't mean that. Fuck. Fuck. Chas, let me just store my collection at your place for a couple of days. Yeah, all right. No way! Yeah, it's gonna be a no, Packer. You can't leave that shit here. Can't leave that shit here. And Jenni hates your guts. And Jenni hates your guts. So you can store it for three days? -Fuck you, Packer! -Fuck you, Packer. Was that you or Wendy? - Wendy, it was Wendy. - It was both of us! It was both of us. Yeah, it-- it was both of us. Look, I've tried four other storage units today. Nada. Son of a bitch! Excuse you? Fuck you, Packer! You can take those comic books -and shove them right up up your ass! -He didn't mean you, honey. He didn't mean-- Right, Packer? You didn't mean Wendy? It was road rage. Right, Packer? Hello? Packer? Asshole! You gotta be kidding me. No fucking way. Hi. Uh, I saw your sign, and I'm looking for a unit. No. - Seriously? - No room. You don't have one unit available? No room at the inn. Uh... should a wise man be bearing a gift? I kind of remember the wise guys having three gifts. What? We are the only place open. Plus the $50 good housekeeping fee. Look, I'm tapped out. And I'm Digger. Follow me. So, Digger. Is that ditches or cemeteries? Like I've never heard that before. -You the only one working in this big place? -Budget cuts, man. 10 by 15. You're the proud owner for a whole seven days. Ugh. Holy shit, what is that smell? Old man smell. He checked out a few days ago. But he was... funky. Jesus. -Why are you here? -Uh, renting a locker? No, you're not. I'm the owner. Look, I paid a lot of money for this. I'll see about that. Hi again. I reprimanded Digger, but since you already paid, you can remain, but only for seven days. - Do you treat all your customers like this? - -Yes. Are those acid-free boxes? Very observant. I understand preservation. You some kind of rare book collector? - Yes, I guess I am. - Uh-huh. My guess is you collect comic books. - Wow. - Silver Age comic books. Uh, you know comics? Are you a collector, or... Seven days. Unbelievable. She knows comics. Thanks for the gifts. What am I doing? Oh, what is that smell? Oh, my God. What? Chas, hey, what's up, man? Um, yeah, I'm fine. Uh, it was just a little hit and run. Yeah, but I'm okay. Um, let's-- let's catch up tomorrow, though, all right? All right. Harry... ...your sacrifice won't have been in vain. Look, she was a stunning blonde, mysterious. -Nice. -You know, I think the coolest part, though, was she knew comics. Packer, you meet a beautiful mystery woman, and your only takeaway is that she knows about comics? -You're twisted, man. -Dude, I didn't catch her name. But I did see "Leto" on some-- - Leto? - Yeah, Leto. - Leto? - Yes, Leto. -Leto. -Leto. -The Leto sisters? -I don't know. Ooh, Packer. Packer! You hit the jackpot! Diana and Apollonia are filthy rich. They own that old mansion over by Ingram Street. They're having some big party tonight. -How do you know this? -Come on, don't you read the Daily Bugger? -God, that dumpster fire website? -Dumpster-- -The Bugger is the truth. -Mm-hmm. Hey, guys. My manager wanted me to come over to ask you to bring it down a little bit. Sorry about that. Are we being too loud? Um, not so much the volume. It's more of the content. What? Uh, even the other customers notice every day you two just talk and talk on and on. It's a lot of backstory about, like, your boring personal stuff. Uh, your jobs, your wives, things like that. If it's so boring, then why do you guys listen? It's kind of like a bad car accident. It's kind of hard to turn away from it. -I'm sorry about that. -Thank you. Well, we need a new restaurant, so... - Yeah. -Anyway, what were you saying about the Letos? Right. So, they're collectors like you. Uh... Well, not like you. They actually make money. They do antiques. It's real world-class stuff. How can you call yourself a collector and you've never heard of the Letos? Yeah, we probably met at a garage sale or two. I don't know, man, we had this weird connection. Strange. -Yeah? -Yeah. Shit. Where have you been? Homeless. I was worried. No call. Didn't seem worried when you kicked me out. - I think that-- - Shut up, Chas. Yeah, okay. Jenni, I love you. But you can't stand my collecting. You have serious issues, Packer. You're immature. You let those stupid comic books run your life. As opposed to you running my life? Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. You made a commitment to us. Us. Our future together. Look, that's why I'm doing this. That's why I'm getting these comics, okay? I'm not gonna work at Rhino Paper my whole life. That's not how I'm gonna get what I want. You think having things makes you special? It's real special. All right? You lost our honeymoon. Look, I'll get it back, okay? Packer, I need commitment. More than you're giving me now. So, it's... it's comics or us. What's your answer? You just don't get it. Okay. I've-- I've had it. Comic nerd. The wedding's off. You've blown it. Jenni, just-- I'm sorry. Just-- just give me another chance. Never call me. Ooh... Well, at least you and your comics will have a nice, warm storage locker to live in. Jesus. All right. Okay. You have amazing brain capacity. Dr. Etrange, I don't think that's the capacity you're interested in. I would so love to own your head. You know, I usually measure the astronauts' skulls before they're shot into space. And what are the results when they come back? Apollonia, you know they never come back. It's all a government cover-up. - Seriously? - Yes. Now, may I have a volunteer? - I volunteer. - Thank you, my darling. I'm going to try something I've never attempted. Are you kidding me? Something is wrong. Oops. Dr. Etrange, that joke never gets old. You're certainly not on the guest list. I, uh, live down the street and heard the commotion. Mm-hmm. Nice try. Wait a minute. I know you. You're one of our storage customers. I saw you on the security footage. I thought a blonde I met the other day on the facility... That's my sister. We own it together. And you are? - Packer Stanley. - Oh. Gentleman. Packer. One of those football fans? No. My, uh, father loaded boxes on the dock, and therefore the distinguished name. Oh, working class. How delightful. Yes, indeed. What brings you here this evening? Ah, I was actually looking for your sister. We had a very interesting conversation the other day. Now I know you're lying. My sister is socially defective. Unless you're a collector. - Actually, I am. - Ah. That's the only subject of interest to her. He collects comic books. -Ah. -Yes. Comic books. -Oh. -Now, the values can be quite high. How do you preserve them from decay? Higher quality books are graded and then sealed in a mylar shell. Sealed in mylar. I detest the constant marketing. Those superheroes, the terrible films. It isn't true cinema. Not like The Godfather. I mean, those films have the same hero's journey you'd find in The Godfather. Well, except Godfather III. But most comic books, like miracles, are based in fact. Come now. You don't truly believe that our ancestors leaped mountains and lifted boulders? Well, maybe not fly, but there were some true heroes. Did any of them have spider powers? Okay, let's not make fun of our guest. Excuse us. Cheap pulp paper. I pray they're not in the auction. It's not like he collects Picassos and Monets. Oh, did they draw comic books? Whoa. Our friends can be rude. There are people of high incomes and accumulative interest. Eh, collectors. Dr. Etrange collects human heads. Wait, are you serious? Human heads? But most collect art, antiques. The usual humdrum. Some are flat-out crazy. Jennifer over there believes that she's the model for Columbia Pictures. -Ow! -Oh! Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. There must be something wrong with my glove. Here, have something for that. Thanks. My, you are handsome. - Uh, for a comic book collector, I guess. -What's your story? -Yeah, usual humdrum. Inner city kid seeking stratospheric wealth, so. Direct. You remind me of someone I cherish. I have to get back to the party, or my sister will be furious. Can you return tomorrow night? Eightish? I'd love to show you around some more. I-- I don't-- Whoa. A dinner invite with Diana Leto? Uh, no. - It's her sister, actually. Apollonia. Look, can you just do me a favor and not tell Wendy this? No Wendy. Check. Okay? I'd just rather Jenni not know. You haven't talked to her or anything? Uh, no. I'm pretty sure it's over. Make sure, Packer. You've hurt her enough. Yeah, I have. Yeah, it's definitely over. Oh. So sorry. Hey, uh, I meant to ask. I saw this strange kid hiding out the other night... Um, here's Daddy. - Striking man. - Yeah. He's everything to me. A jealous collector killed him five years ago. Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks. Um, do you wanna see the rest of the house? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. I'd do anything to bring Daddy back. Yeah, no, I completely understand, yeah. No, you don't. I'm researching it. You're gonna have to do a little more explaining. Well, I have a secret that I haven't told you yet. I'm a witch. Oh, yeah. That's-- that's cool. Uh, I'm a comic book collector, so... I'm not a very good witch. Wait, you really think you could bring your father back with witchcraft? Come with me. I wanna show you a special spot. Okay. -Oh, wow. -It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. Have you ever heard of the Greek myth about the god Apollo and his victim, Daphne? Uh, she-- she was turned into a tree, right? You are smart! Yeah, she was turned into a laurel, and she became immortal. I don't know if I like where this is going. You said so yourself that myths are often based on facts. You are quite the dinner host. Baby, you have no idea. Hello, sister. You returned. Is this gonna become a daily occurrence? I seem to offend you? Quite the opposite. You intrigue me. -As a collector. -Well, yeah, but I'm a collector-- Look out! Damn! -Why did you do that? -This looks bad. - We need to get him up to my room. -It was George. -Are you sure? I'm certain now. Can you save him? I'm a witch, not a freakin' doctor. - We gotta try something. - Okay. Right. Twig from a laurel tree... -Hurry! -Okay! Hold this. All right. Watch your hands. Okay. All right. Hey. Packer... I owe you my life. It was nothing. Who'd wanna hurt you? It was our uncle. He escaped his care facility. But we're gonna need you to keep this confidential. If the authorities find out about this... Yeah, you can trust me. But if he could get a gun that easily... I'd like to reward you. Do you wanna work for us? Yeah! Well, do-- doing what? Just get some rest first. We can discuss details later. There's something you're not telling me. Daddy, I'm so sorry. I am trying, but I'm failing. I wish Daddy were here with us. But your witchcraft says that he is. I mean all the way back. You know, maybe he could help us resurrect this financial situation. Like he could control your spending. It's for my research! Besides, it's not like your business skills have kept us so afloat. Sister, let's not argue. My plan will pay off. - Just let me borrow Packer until the auction. - -Why? Has the great Diana Leto actually fallen for another soul? Of course not. But he did save my life. Fine. But when it comes to my research, I get him back. You sure you should? You seem to have many... shall I call them "misfires"? Hey, I'm still learning. Besides, it's not a science. Yeah, it's quite the opposite, Apollonia. You can go screw yourself. Transmutation. Resurrection. It's ludicrous. I appreciate your offer, George. I sincerely do. But I'm in no need of a partner. If Harry and I know about this deal, others do too. You'll need our financing. And you're gonna need our protection. You do mean to include other parties? 'Cause I know you and Harry don't have that much money. -I take this as a no? -You may. As I said, no partners. You can't raise this kind of money by yourself. Unless you sell part of your collection. Never. You know those Albanians play pretty fuckin' rough. You can't close this deal. Let's just say... I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes. My shoes can't be filled by a mere mortal like you. Oh, goddamn. That's nasty to the bitter end. That's not a threat, is it, George? Kirby needs to listen to reason. This acquisition's too big for him. It's too big for your whole family. Even if you do acquire it... everybody's gonna come for it. He'll be a dead pharaoh in the tomb, one who can't keep his treasures forever. I will keep them forever. You know what? Y'all need to go sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here. Should I have Digger stop him? No. George is no threat. Why are you doing this? He was our last hope. Don't challenge me, Diana. -Yeah, don't challenge Father. -Would you please shut up? You have no standing in this conversation. I have as much to lose as you do. I've navigated our fortune successfully so far, and I will win this prize too. With or without your support. You have my support, but use my skills. You need me. I'll handle this myself. Yeah. Should've let me take over. Quite the Gordian knot you left us in, Father. Well, look at you. You're looking much better. Yeah, I feel better than ever. Did you save my life? Um... guilty. I had these crazy hallucinations last night. Yeah, you were really out of it. -Yeah. -Oh, good news. Diana is impressed by you, and she thinks you can join her collector society. I-- I'd love to, but, uh, I-- I don't fit. I smelled a lot of old money the other night. Well, there's old money and then there's new money. Yeah, I'm no money, so. Those old windbags could really use some new blood. Besides, they might be able to help you with your collection. They have a huge network. And your storage locker would be free. Wow. Sounds too good to be true. It is. So you'll join us? Um... First, you do a little favor for me. Oh, my God. Uh, favor. Um. Oh, my God. Boy, when are you gonna learn to tie your own shoes? Shoes. -Your enemy's back. -Enemy. Apollonia say we had the wrong Fisk. Your real enemy is still alive. -Kill Fisk! -Wait a minute. Wait. She has a plan. Kill now! What the hell? Oh! Do you have any idea how hard it was to sneak out on Wendy? You guys are separated. -Oh, yeah. -Plus, Apollonia said I might need your help. Besides, you still owe me for not telling people Stacy Wen beat you up. -Man, I was seven! -She was six. She had the reach on me, remember? I specifically remember you biting her. I did bite her. I did-- I did bite her. Yeah. Burn in hell, Stacy. Wherever the hell you are. Hope that scar's still ugly. Hi. Uh, Apollonia sent us. -Who? -Uh, Apollonia? - Oh, my God. - Apollonia sent us. Let us in, please! Thank you! You do not have to be such a dick. Boys. Have a seat. Sorry about my friend. Apollonia sent me. She said you had something for me. Oh. Yes. Yes. My son died recently, and he left all these old comic magazines from the '60s. -They're yours. -They-- they're mine? Silver Age. There's a Spyder run from 2749. And-- Oh, my God. And they're in very fine condition. Very fine, Chas. -That's fine, Packer. -No, very fine. Okay. -Your friend is obsessed. -Yeah. Textbook insanity. Or daily irregularity. You know, I can never tell, to be honest. You have a rotten attitude. Nah. I'm just honest. I need an honest human being for a little spell I've got cooked up. What are you, some kind of witch or something? I don't mean to burst your bubble, but I don't believe in that shit. Oh, you don't have to believe. I do. So, it's as simple as that? The comics-- comics are mine? Yes. Oh, and you do need to get my son's pendant and gold tooth. Yeah, so she says she's a witch. A real witch. I know. She's teaching me incantations. Yeah, she wants to go to the-- the graveyard and dig up her son? Packer, either you want to be a real collector or you don't. If you're on the left side of the road, okay. Same with the right. - Middle of the road... - ...you get killed. Did you just quote the fucking Karate Kid at me? You know, I thought your little comic books were worth all your trouble. Besides, there's not anything there that's alive that will get you. Silly boys. Hello? I like the middle of the road. Look, right there. "Jonathan J. James. Born 1841. Died 1942. Newspaper publisher." I have a feeling this is not her son. You think the world's scariest Golden Girl might've lied to us? I don't know. This whole thing stinks. I'm about to smell just how much. Chas. Chas, come on. I need-- I-- I need your help, man. - Oh, shit. - All right. Oh, my God. Shit. Ooh! -It just fucking winked at me! -Just grab the gold tooth. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Ah, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck this. - I can't do this shit, man. - What the hell, man? -I can't do it! -Just give it to me. Come on. You do it. You do it. Be careful. Be careful, Packer. Be careful. Be careful. -Oh, that's sick. -Well, let's grab the pendant, then go home. Only if you never become my dentist. Just grab it by the crystal. - He moved! - He didn't move. - I swear I saw something. - Oh, my God. I'll do it. I'll do it. Careful. Chas! No. Shit! Fuck! Shit! Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck! Fuck that shit. Well... -I'm scarred. -You're scarred? I just got maggots up my ass. Could be worse. How could it be worse? Yeah, you're right. You boys are a mess! Fuck you. Here you go. Yeah, that corpse was alive. Fear can play tricks on the eyes. Who's your friend? Oh. I'm, um, Chas. Chas. Chas Morales, at your service. Ooh. I know what I saw, and that body was moving. I'm putting you in my filing system. Oh. That's cool. That's awesome. What is happening? Shut up. Diana, that corpse was alive. Did Apollonia give you anything to eat or drink, or make a suggestion about the undead? Diana, Chas. Could you put in a good word for me with your sister? -Dude. -What? Uh, uh, yeah. At breakfast. Despite her manner, she does have a PhD in chemistry and she uses a wide array of mixtures to experiment on people. So you're saying she drugged us? It's possible. Her research is very important to her. Come by as soon as you can. That Apollonia. Drugged, like a damn lab rat. Apollonia didn't drug you. She couldn't have. It was probably just your imagination or something. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. Probably my imagination. I wonder if any of these books are real. You know, I think she kinda likes me. I mean, this is all so fucked up. But to own issue 130 of The Spyder in this condition is just amazing. She is amazing. I'm gonna see more of her. Wait, no. - Man, I'm married! - Separated. -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. Oh, yeah... Nice. Yes? What is it? -He's turning into wood. -That's-- You're mistaken. And it spreading fast. And he's growing. That's impossible. Let me see. Um... I'm guessing wood no good? Roady, you need to get your own place. Hey, Dr. K knows chiropracting. He knows comics and he cracks a mean back. That didn't hurt. You're still alive. - Is he okay? - Yeah, he's fine. What a find. Where did you get these? Well, you're not gonna believe me, but, uh, I got 'em from a witch. Okay. I can respect secret identities. So are you buying? - You're selling? - I'm a new man. How much are you asking? Well, guide says about 33,000, and with your overhead and dealer's cut, I'm thinking about 20k. Dr. K! That's too much! That's too much. Come on, Roady. You're not gonna find 'em in this condition. Don't make me go to McFarlane Comics. 18,500. Can't wait to get 'em slabbed. Look, you're getting a deal because I need a place to live. Who's immature now, Jenni? God, when are they gonna get rid of that smell? Digger, I paid my bill! Digger? Who's there? Hello? Jesus. Digger! Digger! Damn it. Digger! What are you doing in the dark? Meditating? Something-- something's in here. We ain't got no mice. Let me look around a little bit. -I don't see nothing, doc. -Look, I-- Somebody was in here. These places get a little lonely, and people always thinkin' they're hearing something. Got a package for you. Hey, uh, Digger... do you know anything about Apollonia and Diana's crazy uncle? Who? Uh, the guy who shot me the other day? Look, man. I don't know nothin' about nothin'. What was that? Packer, a small token of my appreciation for saving my life. Love, Diana. - Hey. - Yes. What is it? Your boy just tried to kill your boyfriend. Daddy shouldn't be there. I'll talk to him. And we lost two customers. The good news is, they're paid up. How's your wound? Oh, yeah. Better each day, actually. Did they ever catch your uncle? Oh, yes. He's doing much better, too. Good, good. Thank you again for rescuing me. Yeah. Uh, we collectors have to stick together, you know? So, why would he try to hurt you? Um, I'm sorry, I didn't-- Ah, it's not you. It's my father's collection. My poor, delusional uncle believes it's his. Yeah, Apollonia told me about his death. -I'm really sorry. -Don't be. Kirby Leto, the ultimate collector. He outworked and out-schemed his competition. One of them murdered him. Murdered? Mm-hmm. The killer's still at large. -So it wasn't your uncle? -He was a suspect, but no. So you and Apollonia own the collection, therefore, you own the threat. That's possible. But we're about to be rid of it. -We're auctioning it off. -Oh, God. To get rid of all those priceless items? -Ooh! -I couldn't do that. You have my father's appetite for collecting. No, I can't compare to him. I collect comic books. But I do love that chase, the thrill of finding and owning that rare edition. I even love the smell of old comic books. It's weird, yeah, but... I love it. No, I understand. Perhaps I love it, too. More than I should. Whatever I want, I get. Wait. What about Apollonia? I-- She's saving herself for someone else. Besides, we don't mind sharing. What? Digger, you better find him. I said find him! Shit. I was like, "What?" Hey, it's me. I almost just ran into Jenni. Good thing you didn't. By the way, I got a lead on the Letos. Got a friend named Maxwell who wants to meet with you. -Who's he? -Let's just say... he's a flush to my full house in a poker game. I cleaned him out. -Who is he? -Maxwell writes for the Daily Bugger. No. No reporters. He's discreet. Okay? I'll see you at Sandman's tomorrow at 1:00. Bye. Chas? Shit. Damn it. Dust everywhere. Now, I got allergies. They don't pay me enough for this shit. You're a rich man. Sign over your damn money to the sisters so I can get the hell out of here. That you? Damn it! Stop this shit now, or I'll tell Apollo-- Every day... a damn freak show. Osborn, it's good to see you. Diana. It's a pleasure to see you. What brings you to my humble establishment? Here to pick up the Louis XIV chandeliers. No, no, no, no. You're behind on your payments, my dear. Yeah, that's not true. You've dealt honorably with our family for years. -Our credit is outstanding. -My sources say otherwise. You should ask your ridiculous sister. -Hey, show some respect. -Stay out of this. This is between the professionals. Diana, you are a fool. Little help, please? Hey! Your temp agency is gonna hear about this. - Stay down. - You will regret this. Let's go. God, what a dick. -You all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. I remember my father having to fight off deadbeats. Yeah, he seemed a bit snarky about your credit. Everybody's jealous of our family and the lies and innuendo hurled at us, it's never ending. Well, no one's ever gonna do that to you again, okay? My friend, meet the transference crystal. Oh, damn it. What am I doing wrong? Oh, damn it. -Maxwell, good to see you. -How are you? -This is Packer. -Nice to meet you. -Good to meet you. -Packer, Maxwell works for the Daily Bugger. - The gossip site? - Any news that's unfit to print. So, what do you know about the Letos? Okay, well... The other night someone took a shot at-- -Chas already told me. -I already told him that. Okay, well, what do you know about them? Their father, Kirby Leto, was gunned down about five years ago. Never found a killer. It's really hush-hush in the media. There was lots of money tossed around. Maybe that's the guy that took a shot at me. I hear the sisters are in trouble financially. So, maybe there's some big transaction going on. Yeah, they're auctioning off the Leto collection. -Whoa, what? -Packer. - What is Apollonia been saying about me? - Oh, my God. Hey, you don't want to get involved with those two. I hear they're into witchcraft. Uh, just one of them. The other one's completely normal. So, there's no prime suspects? Yeah, dozens. George, one of the Fisk twins, is the lead suspect. But George "proved" he was out of the country when it all went down. Okay, well, how do I get in contact with Mr. Fisk? George is a ghost. He went missing last week. But there is another collector, Norma Romita. -I can get you in touch with her. -Yeah? Can I get her info? Text me. Maxwell's gonna do some snooping, but, in the meantime, I need vital stats on a certain redhead. Oh, my God, dude. Hey, there is one other thing other than the witchcraft. Which is really messed up. Collectors always seem to go missing. That sounds right. They're probably really old, though. Yeah, but the bodies are never found. Lost at sea, horrible fire. If they're found, they're found in parts. Their fortunes just disappear. And now the Fisk twins are missing. -It's you. -You yourself. How did you find my house? Well, I'm assuming you're Norma Romita. We were never introduced. Did the sisters send you? Uh, no, I'm actually here on my own. - I had a couple questions for you. Comicology, or whatever the hell you call it, isn't my subject field. That's funny, but, uh, no. It's about someone shooting me the other night. Maybe, uh, George or Harry Fisk. Gunplay's not my subject field either. Look, it just seems like someone's trying to kill Diana and Apollonia, maybe the same person that killed their father. Get the hell out of here and tell those stupid little whores they don't know who they're messing with. I can go to the police. Where's George Fisk? Leave now. That didn't go well. He's definitely on to us. Jesus, George, what the shit? You're a loose end, Norma. Packer, what the fuck are you doing? S, D, one, T, K, zero. Yeah. Apollonia. Chas. -It's good to see you. -It's good to see you. You know, I was actually gonna come find you. -You were? -Mm-hmm. Well, that's awesome. What brings you here? Packer tells me your life's in danger. I'm here to serve and protect. -Well, aren't you a gentleman? -You know it. -Oh, so charming. -Mm-hmm. -You're coming to my office. -Let's go, let's go. Come on, don't be shy. Welcome to my sanctuary. Please, explore. Enjoy. Oh, I'd be careful with that, if I were you. It's either tipped with poison or a sleeping potion. Okay, not gonna touch. Not gonna touch that anymore, that's for sure. Man, so you really are a witch. -On a good day. -On a good day. You know, I've never heard of a witch that owns a storage facility. Well, it's a little more secure than your usual facility. - Yeah, I mean, these knives right here. We store valuable objects here. You know, like Packer's collection. -Like Packer's collection. Yeah. -Mm-hmm. -The love of his life. -Oh, I-- I thought I was the love of his life. Yeah. Yeah. No, you are. You are. I was-- I was being-- I was being figurative. No, I was-- I was being literal. -Metaphorical? -I'm teasing you. Oh, okay. Okay. Good. No, actually, my sister's really attached to him now, so. -Oh. -Yeah. So... you're free? Well, I'm committed, but, uh, I like fun. I like fun. Oh, I'm vibrating. Yes, Digger. I'll take care of it. Chas, sweetheart, would you wait here for me? -Yeah. -'Kay. I'll be right back. I'll be here when you get back. -I'll stay right here. -Good boy. God, Packer, you sure can pick 'em, man. Oh, God. Okay. Maxwell? Max-- Please, please. Please. My douchebag husband won't answer any of my calls. Packer called me, but he hung up. Maybe breaking things off was a mistake. Trust me, you made the right move. He's got, like, that Peter Pan syndrome. He has no great power and never takes responsibility. Do you think you can change Packer? That's so not gonna happen. He has a good heart. He just makes bad decisions. Jenni, he's an idiot. Yeah, he's an idiot. But he was my idiot. And Chas is mine. I thought the separation might scare some sense into him. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen. Chas will turn up. He's loyal to you. I'm gonna hire a PI. To follow him. -I feel like he's seeing somebody. -Why do you think that? He looks happy. Ah, looks like someone took my little acid bath. -Hey. -Hey. Oh, thank you for that. Oh, there's much more in store for you. -So here is the contact on a collection for sale. -Okay. Um, we never finished our conversation. I'm really worried about you, Diana. I don't want to talk about it. It's family business. Look, I get it, but I'm a part of the business now, so you have to trust me. I, uh, spoke to Norma Romita. Norma. What'd she say? Uh, she didn't say much, but she did jump when I mentioned a George Fisk. -George Fisk. -Yeah, he's the shooter, isn't he? He could be. But thank you for caring and for protecting me. Packer, I-- I think I'm falling for you. There's a big surprise for you tonight. Be sure you're at my house by 7:00, -it's very important. -Okay. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Diana. Where the hell is she? Thank you, my father's spirit remains strong and he would be so proud to have you, his friends, to own his collection. At the right price, of course. Oh, our guest has arrived. Packer Stanley, please come forward. The newest member of the Kirby Leto Society. Wow. Um, thank you. Uh, this is the greatest moment of my life. Um, I'll try not to get too emotional. But... for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm with my own kind. We are fortunate to have you, Packer Stanley, the newest member of the Kirby Leto Society. Thank you. A small token of my affection for you. You've given me too much already, Diana. You'll never guess what it is. But h-- how? No one's ever seen it in 9.8, near mint condition. I told you. Whatever I want, I get. Yes! I am the Spyder! Jenni? So this is where you've been hanging around? How'd you find me? - Chas told Wendy. - Of course, yeah. Look, we need to talk. You kicked me out. You said you never wanted to see me again. Okay, well, you called me, Packer. And I made a mistake. About the comic collecting, too? No. -But I forgive you. -You forgive me? That's it? Look, Packer. We've known each other our whole lives, and we're meant to be together. But that lust-- that lust for your collection, is ruining us. Well, it's all going great now, so. The world's not made of Spyders and supermen. It is. Okay? To me, it is. Look. The rarest of the rare. Priceless. I got this because the people here appreciate me for who I am. I'm not gonna be a loser like my father, okay? Look, he had nothing. At least I have this. These people only want to use you. I would never do that. Please, let's just go somewhere, and talk about this. I can't. I can't. I'm... sorry you came all this way. Good luck, Packer. I'm so sorry. Can you take a bath once in a blue moon? Digger, help him! That's that wood I was telling you about. What did they do to you, my love? His shoulder's busted up. Looks like some kind of acid. Well, help him, please. His shoulder. Look, Daddy, I know it's gonna hurt, okay? But can you just be strong for me, please? We're gonna get our revenge, all right? We're gonna get-- I know. Digger, help him! It needs a total reconstruction. I don't care, just restore it. It's spreading. Digger, help him! Digger! Digger! Help. It's gonna be okay. Roady, you're gonna love these. What a goldmine. Where did you find these? I have a new girlfriend, and she's pretty generous. Does she have a sister? I don't think I have the cash for this stash. Well, we can work something out. -You could sell them, can't you? -Hey, no problemo. Hey, you got another one of these Spyder canisters? There you go, Packer. It's rare. Hey, what the hell, man? That was mine. -Fuck off, Harry Potter. -I do love rare. Norma. Hey, Norma, hey. Hey. Norma, hey. Come on, Chas, pick up. Chas, uh, it's Packer. Um, I need you to call me back as soon as you can. It's really important. Where the hell is he? Did you call the police? - No. - Good. That would be a nasty business. Can't believe it. Norma dead. I mean, they were thorough, too. Gunshot, knife wound, burning. I mean, it looked like acid, but I couldn't tell. I mean, the killer did not like her, and after meeting her, I can-- I could see why. So, why is someone killing collectors? Where'd you hear that fairy tale? A reporter. Not Maxwell from the Daily Bugger? -He's a hack. -Packer, he is. He hounded us after Father's death. Our friends inform us he's got a drug problem. Interesting. We need to stay vigilant. Apollonia, tell Digger to hire extra security, especially with the auction coming up. So do you think Norma's death and the auction are related somehow? Never underestimate the desperation of a collector. Where are you, huh? What the hell? How did this little shit break these chains? What is that smell? Packer. Jesus. -Hey. -Where is he? Sure, come on in. That no-good slacker. And of whom do you speak? You, asshole. Where's Chas? Look, I left a few messages for him, but I honestly, don't know, okay? You two are always conspiring. -You know where he is. -Wendy. I don't know where he is, okay? This is not like him. I'm starting to worry. -A graveyard? Seriously? -What? I found the directions in his wallet. There is a dirty shovel in our tool shed. What kind of freakshow are you two doing? Having sex with what, dead bodies? That was a college thing. We grew out of that phase. Look, a sweet, nice old lady asked me to clean up her son's gravesite, and Chas was nice enough to help me out. Wendy, I'm sure he will turn up. All right? You have that jerk-off call me, if he knows what's good for him. Okay. Wait, where are you going? No wait, you're not saying? No! Aw. Fuckin' A. Come on, Chas. Pick up. Hey, kid. What are you doing up there? Stupid kid. Weirdo! Fuck you. Ow! He escaped his cage. Your little man is out of control. Daddy was just exercising his independence. He's getting ready for his big night. Must you call him "Daddy"? That again? He is our father. As you wish. Just please, no more experimentation. I cannot have another set of Jenga blocks scampering about. Go to hell. Oh, I'm sure we all will. We have Packer's friend, we have that reporter, Norma Romita is dead, others are gonna follow. Just control your boy. -Packer's mine. Understood? -No. He is a perfect match for Daddy's blood, I need him. No. He is too valuable to me. God. You love him. I said he's valuable. So you're telling me that you have no feelings for him whatsoever? Oh, no, Sister. Packer's mine. Huh. You know, I'm surprised the sisters haven't discovered me yet. Diana... was trained by the finest, her father. And except for my twin brother, Kirby, was probably my best friend. But times change. One collector becomes jealous of another's gains. Hmm. You know, it's sad, really. How mere objects... can cause the end of a very valuable friendship. Money's not the root of all evil. No. It's the love of money! That's the root of all evil! And I just loved his money. And his collection. I was gonna kill him. But that crazy... slut Diana beat me to it. Gotta give her props, though. She did a whizbang job of framing me for the murder. Now she's got what I want. I was going to kill her. I won't make that mistake again. All right, fellas, you've seen the pictures. George Fisk. Don't grab him. Alert me immediately. He'll be packing. Also, there's a messed up little kid hanging around. Leave the kid alone, and whatever you do, please, please, do not touch him. He got some kind of funky skin rash going on. Chas? No, Mr. Stanley, it's George Fisk. I believe you've been looking for me. I am. I have some questions for you. Wait just a second here. I got somebody that wants to talk to you. Packer, he-- he kidnapped me-- - Ah, ah! - Jenni? I have something you want. You can get me entry into the auction. What do you say, we, uh, meet, and, uh, do a little trade-off, huh? Just-- just let her go, and I can get you in. Let's meet at the sisters' storage facility tonight. Six o'clock, be there. Oh, oh, and I understand you have a very rare comic book. - Who says? - You bring the book. I'll bring the girl. We'll make a swap. The book? Insurance. To make sure you don't double-cross me. And you goddamn sure better not tell anyone. I won't. You better not. Last time you told about Norma, and the sisters paid her a very ugly little visit. I want your word that you'll be quiet. -Or I'll kill her. -Yes. - "Yes," what? - Yes, you have my word. That went well, didn't it? -Everything ready for tonight? -Digger. Good. It's a shame we mistook Harry for George. Imagine sacrificing your own brother as George did. But there's something else. That kid is out of control. The disease? Yes, but Apollonia says he'll do what she says. There are things in this world, wild things... they're born wild. And always stay that way. No matter how much you think you control them. What do you suggest? Kill him? She's not gonna change her mind about him being our father. It's all gonna hit the fan. Just don't expect me to hang around and pick up the pieces. I guess you want me to clean that up, huh? You'll have much to clean up after tonight. Oh, my sweet Chas. I wish we had more time for fun. But you know you turned that reporter on to us. And we can't have that. I do want to keep you around just a little bit longer, in case things don't work out with Packer. Yes, that is a very powerful sedative running through your bloodstream. It turns out, I'm not just a witch. I am a damn good chemist. Oh, I suppose I'm being a tease. Oh, excuse me. I'm vibrating again. Hello. Are you sure? As you wish. So, bad news. Turns out we do need your storage space for tonight. What can I say? Business is booming. I'm so sorry for the accounting error. Bye, Chas. I'll miss you. Come on, I need a weapon. One I can hide. Spyder filament. No villain can break it. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. -Jenni. -Shut up! The book, Mr. Stanley. You okay? -I'm not okay. -The book! Here. Just be careful with that, okay? Yeah, all right. Get us in this place. - Hey, hold the elevator. - No. Asshole! - Can you believe the nerve of that guy? How do you know this guy? Mr. Stanley and I have never really met. He believes I'm a murderer. His new girlfriend, Diana Leto, killed my twin brother, Harry, thinking he was me. This is what you left me for? Sounds like a mistake you didn't mind. Oh, Harry was blood, but... I have my needs. Yeah, like getting the Leto collection? You and I are no different, Mr. Stanley. You'd do whatever it takes to get what you want. No, I wouldn't. You sold yourself to those two whores for a comic book. I'm not like you. Oh, really? Well, it looks like the majority of us in this elevator - have a different opinion of that. We're here. Let's go. - Is this the auction? - No. -The appraiser's that way. -Hey! Watch where I'm going. Say, you're kinda cute. Hey, beat it, lady. Go to Hell, you old bastard! Go to rehab, you lush! Good evening. My sister, Apollonia, and the spirit of my father, Kirby Leto, welcome you. Tonight, you are here to bid on the world's greatest collection. The one my father painstakingly acquired over his lifetime. You are here to own rare art, gold, diamonds, and other priceless treasures. We had hoped the crowd would be larger, but circumstances are what they are. Tonight, we also have world-famous DJ, KTel Ronnie. However, I must confess, tonight is, in small part, a charade. Charade? What do you mean, Diana? Alas, the Kirby Leto collection is no more. Over the years, our father squandered it all. When he was ready to make the biggest acquisition of his life, one of you cowards shot and killed him. That's right. And I loved him the most. And one of you took him away from me. But guess what? I brought him back. Through your skillful witchcraft? Shut up! While our father's collection is lost, there is a valuable collection here, one you'll all be a part of. Let's watch the screen. No, no! You are lying! No, it can't be! That's right, and you'll soon be joining them. We like to think of you as our collection of collectors. You can't do that! And you will willingly sign over your wealth to us. -You sick bitch! -Psycho! I understand a week in our plexiglass containers is quite unbearable. And I've prepared a special concoction for each and every one of you that will make you beg for your lives and the sweet surrender of death. And now, may I reintroduce my father, Kirby Leto. Daddy, help yourself. ♪ I said, you ♪ ♪ Heard me on Heard me on the stereo ♪ ♪ And it, and it's smooth ♪ ♪ So smooth ♪ ♪ Got that rhythm Got that groove ♪ ♪ Hold me, hold me ♪ ♪ I want my... ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Shake it up ♪ What is he doing? He's not supposed to kill, only disable. They have to sign their estates over to us. ♪ Are you down? ♪ Hurry up, we don't have much time. -What do you want? -Kirby's greatest acquisition. It's greater than the Mona Lisa. -You're fucking crazy. -Go! Right there, right there. Go. The sisters are dead broke, but all they have is their father's collection right there. No, you're lying. Oh, bust that bitch open, Mr. Stanley. No! Get out of the way! Goddamn, son of a bitch! That scum Kirby Leto! He never acquired it! Collectors cheating other collectors. Didn't see that one coming. - Move, bitch. Move, bitch! - Okay. Stay. -You still got work to do, you know. -You're not the boss of me! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? He's a monster! - Jesus Christ. - Hey! Run! - Run! - Jesus Christ! I think we lost him. This family doesn't suffer from insanity. They fucking love every minute of it. - Shh. - I'm sorry. -Check around the corner. -Okay. - Oh, my God. My God. - Are you following me? -Wanna give me a kiss, please? -Oh, my God. Oh, shit! - Forget it. - Fuck it. - Are you crazy? - Bitch, run, run, run! There you are. I found you. Just for fun. You come with me. And you, too, handsome. - Did you think you could escape? - New body. No. Get revenge first. Him. Fisk! - No, no, no. - Come on! I want your body. You're a long fucking way from Kirby Leto. I didn't kill him. Diana did. Now give me the body. I can see you. Spyder. Spyder. "Spee-der." -Spyder? -Here. Spee-- spy-- spyder? "Spee-der?" -Shut up. -Weird word. Hey. This isn't funny. Let me out. Come on, untie me. It's about time you came to, sleepyhead. What was that thing? Oh, don't worry about him. Daddy's linked to you, you know. He'll be here soon. "Linked"? What do you mean? Maybe I'm not the shitty witch everyone says I am. He's alive in the boy. But the boy is dying. He has this cancerous growth. Probably because of the laurel tree, I just-- I don't wanna hear this shit. Shh! As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted... the formula is ancient. Grant immortality and transfer life all in one easy step. What? You think I'm crazy? "Crazy" is an understatement. Yeah, you're batshit. Well, Diana agrees with you. But I am not gonna mess it up this time. I'm gonna get it right, thanks to you. 'Cause you brought me the pendant. - Shit. - That's right. The transference crystal. You cannot imagine the power. So Daddy moves into you... and then I'm not exactly sure where your spirit goes. Hmm, anyway, I will love my daddy and your body just the same. God, you twisted freak. Because you're a man. Packer. Packer, are you okay? You bitch. You skank. You ruined my fucking wedding. Do you know how much tiramisu costs? - Jesus, Jenni. She's a witch, not a vampire. - Packer! -Are you okay? -Is that her? -Yeah. -The one you've been seeing? Yeah. Well, no, not anymore. Whoa! Sorry sister, but you've gone too far. I will not have you interfere with my plans. And you should know, I killed Kirby. He lost our fortune, and he's just as incompetent as you. So she wanted to put your father's soul in my body? For sex. What can I say, she's always been a daddy's girl. -God. -Sick. She forced all of this on me. Her grand delusions of being a witch. You really look like you were forced into this. I didn't wanna be forced into anything, I didn't wanna do this shit, -but she and Digger threatened to kill me. -Yeah, right. But that kid out there is a monster. He's probably searching for us. We need to go someplace safe. Diana, it's ruined. I could find you another. Come on. Shit. Fuck. You are me. Me are you. Packer, say this... What? What the hell? He was-- it was him. The boy that-- Yes, it was her stupid, failed witchcraft. She turned that thing into a living horror. Luckily, I learned one of her curses. Jenni! I'm sorry, she got his contagion. She had to go. Diana, what the fuck? Look, now, we can be together. Packer, I love you. You fucking killed her! But I only want-- I can get you the comic. You and your fucking collection. - It's Atomic... Shut up! Shut up. Can't breathe. Jenni, are you okay? It hurts. Okay, um, thank God, you're alive. Um, okay. I'm gonna save you, okay? Put this on it, just apply that. Okay, come on, come on. Okay. Just breathe, okay? Just breathe. Packer, you smell funny. I'm sorry, Jenni. I love you. I've always loved you. But I need Diana back. She's the only one that can get me another Atomic Fiction 15. - No. - I'm sorry. No. No. Packer, no. No! No! No! No! Packer, no!
