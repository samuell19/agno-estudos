Wooden balls should be washed by water. Hiroyuki Okita Sakae Umezu Yoriko Ogawa Riza Nakajo Naomi Matsuda Asako Kurayoshi Produced by Koji Abe. Written by Shintaro Miyawaki and Keiko Aizaki. Screenplay by Tetsuya Sasaki. Produced by Tomoyuki Imai and Takehiro Kikuchi. Directed by Takao Nagaishi. Urgent, urgent! There's going to be an inspection today! What? You've got to be kidding! Wait... - Eh? - Is Sakita doing the inspection? - Yes. - Don't worry, don't worry. - You scared us for nothing. Really? Wait. Wait for me, don't leave. Take off that belt. Unroll your skirt. Alright, go on. Good morning. - Good morning. Are you OK this morning? - Yes. Wait a minute! What's this hair style? And this skirt... the length should be at the knee. Look at this trick... Do you know the consequences? I'm sorry, I won't do it again. Please forgive me. I don't think so. If you violate the rules, you must suffer the consequences. I'm going to call your parents. Madam Fukushima, let me talk to her. You won't do this again, right? Let's go and fix your skirt. Teacher Sakita - your sweetness is keeping us from conducting an effective inspection. On the contrary; punishment is not always the best method. She's right: the length of a girl's skirt is insignificant. Mr Iwasaki - teachers like you have forgotten how to discipline. That's why the morals of the school are crumbling today. Besides, this isn't any of your business. It's no wonder you haven't been assigned a homeroom. Excuse me? I can't believe you'd say something like that! - It's not true anyway. - We'll see about that. - Good morning, Ms Sonoda. - Yes, good morning. Miss Sonoda, can't you give a greeting in the morning? Good morning, everyone. What kind of attitude is that?! She's just a bit blue this morning. You are everything I despise in a teacher! We'll see - I'm going to talk to the director about you. But... wait... Wait! Don't worry, Mr Iwasaki. I'll make a counter-report. I can't win against a spinster's hysteria. - Well, I'm a spinster, too. - Miss Sakita... You're an exception. You're sweet and pretty. I'm flattered... even if you don't mean it. You have the reputation of being a gigolo. Gigolo? Not at all. I'm being honest. We'd better get going. You're not supposed to be home tonight! I left some important notes for tomorrows meeting. Get them and go. Is it a good idea to give attitude to your own husband? I only married him to fit into this society. He's incapable and quiet... That's why I chose him. You are a very bad girl... Make room for me... Let me share your shelter! God, I hate sudden rain! The weather report is never right. I think maybe the Earth has become distorted... What's going on in this world today?! Uncle, I've got a treat for you... What are you watching in broad daylight? Ah, Keisuke. - So you just realised I was here'? You're not supposed to watch movies while you're working. I've got nothing to do in this bad economy. Have you noticed, recently in adult films... you can see fresh young girls, instead of dried-up old women? You shouldn't use your time to critique XXX videos... You should be doing promotion for your real estate business. - Do you want some tea? - Yes. Aren't you too old to be watching that kind of stuff? It has nothing to do with age! If I get a really good XXX video, I'll share it with you. I'm going to search for the ultimate XXX video. 'Ultimate XXX video'? You're just a dirty old man! - Did you say something? - No, I didn't say a thing... - Excuse me... - Yes? Are you looking for a condo or something? - Excuse me... - Yes? - Ls this... A secret business... taking orders for... I heard... What? You want us to rape your wife? - Yes. But why? It's embarrassing to say this... but my wife is a... lesbian. Since we got married, she has never allowed me to touch her. I did some checking up and found out she has a lover... A female lover... And then I asked, “What's going on here?" She didn't say "Sorry," but rather, "So what?" Recently, I've been staying at a Capsul Hotel. At home, she's always with her lover... Why don't you just divorce her? If you want to rape her before getting divorced, we can't do that. We can't punish her for her sexual preferences. She isn't guilty for punishment by Rapeman. - You don't understand... - What don't I understand? - I still love her, despite this. - What? You can laugh at me, but I want her to... experience the exhilaration of sex with a man. If things continue like this, our marriage will be a disaster. Please, teach her the role of a real woman. This is a sensitive issue, the relationship between man and woman. The old song says, "There's a deep river between man and woman“. Please, have your tea and then leave. - I'm serious... But this goes against Rapeman's philosophy. Alright... I have $10,000 here, all of my savings. Please... accept. We'll do it. Who are you? I am... the symbol of man. You have a very strong and distinctive female structure. - Men are disgusting! - Disgusting? And you believe women are not disgusting? Stop... stop it! A man naturally fits into a woman - that's the way nature planned things. You can't deny the nature of things. Appreciate this gift! Give me more! Thanks for your job... I made a lunchbox for you. - I don't need it. - Wait... Because of the job you did last night, we can eat for a while. Don't misunderstand: I didn't accept because of the money. I took it because of his serious face. Did you see his face? - Whatever you say. - Don't be upset... - You're just in a bad mood. - Who caused that bad mood'? We should choose our jobs carefully, otherwise I won't be able to do my best. - I understand. - You don't understand... - Please, don't be blinded by money. - I hear you and understand... Come on, be in a good mood. Everything's alright... Take the lunchbox... You'll feel better. Don't walk so close... girls with girls! What kind of attitude is that?! We need to nip it in the bud. Hurry up. Over there. Keiko, are you OK? - You're bleeding. - I'm OK. - Let me help you. You aren't supposed to do that. You can deal with it yourself. - Don't get so close together. - You're awful! You don't have to cry over this. Teacher, you've gone too far. She's right - what's wrong with caring about friends? Well... I guess... I didn't mean to... What did you mean by, "Don't be so close together“? We have no choice. There are only girls in this school. So why are you talking about girls and girls being close'? Are you saying girls shouldn't be friends with girls, but only with boys? Are you suggesting that we should be involved with boys? No, I didn't mean... I meant nothing like that. I'm talking about the 'extremes' of being close. - Dirty mind! - What? You have dirty thoughts when you see girls together. I think you've been watching too many dirty videos. No, I don't watch dirty videos. I'm joining this boycott! I can't go to a class instructed by a dirty-minded teacher. - Everyone agree? - Yes. - You're right. Uncle... - Who is this? - This is our customer. - Mr Haruoka... who is this? - This is my employee. Let me make some tea for you. Because of your good job, she quit her lesbian ways. - We've had normal sex since then. - That's good! However, she can't have a climax without the costume. - Eh? She's becoming too demanding! She says something is different... I understand your problem, but... I spent all my money, so, please... Can you arrange for it one more time, as part of the service? 'Part of the service'? But... Good morning! I'm sorry about the other day... You're being too friendly! Don't touch me. We'll have to get the uniforms cleaned now. Dirty-mind disease may be contagious. Dirty-mind?! Am I a disease?! What am I supposed to do about this boycott? Teacher... Who...? Let's start class. Do you mean it? You forgive me? I don't need to forgive you. You did nothing wrong. Thank you... I'm so happy to have an understanding student. Teacher, if you hug me, people will misunderstand. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, I'm just so happy. I know. Let's start! Open your mouth... Oh! I got a seed! - Are you alright? - I swallowed a seed. I kissed you indirectly, through the whistle. - Can I have it? - No, you can't... That's mine. I need it for work. Why should I give it to you? I want it for an amulet! What's this all about? No good, no good. Don't look at the floor. - Look at the basket. Alright? - Yes. Come on. Put it in. Good! Good shot. I was selfish when I said I was happy to have you here... But what about you? Do you have trouble from the other girls'? - They are mean to me. - I thought so. But they were also mean before. I've been mistreated by them... but not because of this. What's wrong? Why is a girl like you treated badly? You're outgoing, a nice girl. So what's the reason? I'm only nice in front of you. Actually, I'm an introvert. If you don't mind, tell me about the problems. Mr Iwasaki, why didn't you tell me about the boycott? You know we can't have this sort of thing going on. I was waiting for them to realise their mistake. - I thought you trusted me. - Yes. Mr Iwasaki is a good man. I know you are just teasing him, but... think hard about his feelings. It's hard for anyone, - but especially for a teacher. - Not at all. You deserve to be punished. I order you to do 5 laps of bunny hops. You don't have to get involved. Sometimes it's necessary to punish a student. Why aren't you doing the exercise? She's okay - she's been attending my class. I don't care. I'll do it. I like the bunny hop, anyway. - Sonoda, you don't have to do it. - I don't care. She's weird... when we're alone, she opens up. Girls at that age must go through emotional imbalance. Guys don't understand that. I'll help you work with the girls... But then I'll ask you, when I don't understand something. - Yes. Teacher... Oh, Sonoda. - I want to tell you something. - Okay. What? Excuse me... This way... I can't tell you right here... Would you come to Central Bridge at pm tonight? - Okay. - Thank you, teacher. - Teacher... - Yes? Please, don't get too close to Ms Sakita. That girl is weird! - Mr Iwasaki. - Miss Sakita. You and Sonoda seem to be close. She had something she wanted to tell me - What was it? She's strange... She can't tell me here. What could she be talking about? I'd guess she's in love with you. - Eh? She's jealous of my involvement with you. But, she didn't see you coming. She plans on telling you about her love for you. I can't do it... I'm a teacher and she's just a student. It doesn't matter - you're both a man and a woman. She's a difficult girl... She sees you as the only person who understands her. Please be careful with her. She's late. - Sorry. - Excuse me... Uncle?! Oh, it's you, Keisuke. What great timing! - What? I owe you for the work you did. I have something for you. What's that? - This is the best video from my supplier. Again with the dirty videos?! Give me a break. I'm waiting for someone, and I feel terrible, like a cold is coming on. Listen to me: your sickness will be blown away. This is a video of real high-school students. I don't want to see high-school girls, I have enough trouble with them! Come on. If you see it, you'll feel a lot better. Are you ready? I'll start it now. If you must. - What...?! - I knew you'd like it. That's our school's uniform... Mika Sonoda! Teacher! Help! She's calling to me. She's in danger! What are you doing?! It just started. We've got to watch it together. Wait! That cost $100. Sonoda... Mika! Mika! I'm her teacher at school. What's this all about? I see... her death was caused by an overdose of toluene. She's not the kind of girl who would sniff toluene! Ma'am - I understand how you feel... but she was arrested for this before, along with shoplifting. I never knew about that. We informed her homeroom teacher, Ms Sakita. Yes... I believed Mika could straighten herself out, so I said nothing. I never imagined she could die like this. There must be some mistake... She's not that kind of girl... She's not the kind of girl who should die like this! I know what you mean... She wasn't that kind of girl. I knew her very well. Please, stay calm. Mrs Sonoda, did you notice any difference in her behaviour of late? Not especially... I don't think so. Sometimes she looked depressed... - Did you say depressed? - Yes. When she first started school, her grades were good... and she was cheerful everyday. Then her grades got worse and worse... but I thought it was because of normal 'young girl' problems. I believed she would tell me if something was really wrong. But now... I can't believe she was involved in drug abuse. Teacher - please, you must know she wasn't the kind of girl... who would get into something like this by herself. Something must have pushed her into it... Somebody out there made her do it. I have the report from the medical examiner... As we thought, toluene was the cause of death. From the conditions at the scene of death, we believe it was an accidental overdose. Detective, I have seen other students messing about with toluene, but usually it's two or more experimenting with it. I think it's unusual for her to have taken this drug by herself. Besides, she was supposed to meet me for a conference, and I have evidence of her being there. I think she may have been involved in some foul play. But we already examined the site thoroughly. But would you please look at the evidence again? She had a history of solo criminal activities... She'd already been arrested for drug abuse and shoplifting. Please, don't force us to say distasteful things about her. - Detective, please do it. - Please. Please continue the investigation. I'm convinced there's someone hiding in the shadows. - Please. I'm sorry - I can't. Teacher... - We feel terrible about Mika. - Well... Do you two know anything about drug dealers around here? I've heard about it. Somewhere in Shinjuku... dealers are selling cocaine and toluene to students. Shinjuku? That's 30 minutes away. - Teacher, are you going there? - No way... I wouldn't go someplace like that. No way! - Hey, mister. - Yes? - Do you want to play? - What? $300. You can do anything you want... Except, no kissing. Wait... I don't... You can't... Wait... I'm looking for this girl. Know her? - Are you a five-oh? - Five-oh? - Five-oh... a cop. - No. No, not at all. I'm a friend of hers. I heard she's playing down here. Here, look. I don't know. I've never seen her. Oh, all right... By the way, how come “no kissing"? I save kissing for my boyfriend. It wouldn't be fair to him if I kissed strangers, right? Yes, you're right. I understand. Excuse me. Hey, are you sure you don't want to play? - Yes. See you around. "No kissing"... Does that really make sense? Do you know her? Do you'? That's him. Do it. Excuse me... Have you seen her? Excuse me, do you know her? - That's Mika. - Do you know her? - Yes. So... So, she was around here? - She was selling 'spring' with me. - Spring?! Come here. This way... I need to ask you something. - Talk to me? - Yes. - But I can't talk on the street. - What can we do? Can I... Can we... You're saying that Mika was doing prostitution? Before I answer, you owe me some money. - Eh? My pimp saw us come in here, so he's expecting some money. Alright, okay... You want £300? Let me take a shower. - Wait, wait... - What's wrong now? Was she being threatened by somebody? - I don't know. - Wait a minute... Stop! Police. This is a sweep for prostitution. - Prostitution? - Teacher, what are you... A teacher?! Bastard! Such a dirty teacher! But, what are you... I never laid a finger on her... Yes. What kind of a teacher are you? I suspect... your fingerprints will be everywhere. - You have no excuse. - Wait a minute... No excuses... You had enough fun for one night, teacher. - Take him away. - Yes. - Stand up. Get up! - Wait, please! I'm innocent. You're hurting me! Stop! - Excuse me... - What? How can it be a 'sweep', if I'm the only one arrested? He said it was a sweep? You need to wake up. Detective Imamura is on the vice squad, too? I told you to wake up... He's responsible for youth crime. - Excuse me, sir. - Come in. - Uncle. - Keisuke! I'm sorry. This is all because I showed you that dirty video, and you got too excited! Captain, this is all my fault. Please arrest me instead. What are you talking about? It's so embarrassing. I'm innocent. How can you say such a thing? You were caught red-handed. Captain... I'm innocent, I swear! Teacher, you may be innocent of prostitution charges... but you were still with an under-age girl in a sex hotel, eh'? That's a scandal, right'? I understand: you are a teacher at a prestigious high school. If the media gets hold of this, what's going to happen? Well, I don't want to create a bad reputation for our city due to a teacher scandal. Besides, Miss Sakita has intervened on your behalf. Just this one time, I will make an exception. Miss Sakita, you believe I'm innocent, right'? I was just investigating Sonoda's death on my own. Hold it right there! Her death was an accident. That's the official verdict of the medical examiner himself. Besides, we have testimony from the girl you picked up. If you keep making excuses, the Captain will change his mind and re-open this case. That's enough. I personally believe in him... but the school officials have decided to suspend him... until everything has been cleared up. But... I'm sorry to say this... The Principal says for him to start looking for a new job. Enough of this! I truly am innocent. Captain, we're sorry. Please, help us with the school. Uncle, I really am innocent. You don't understand the situation here! Pardon us, please! I felt there was nothing else we could do... - Under the circumstances... - Don't worry. I understand. I got a bit out of control. There are so many weird things going on. For instance, that detective is supposed to be working on youth crime... but they were involved in a Vice Squad bust. But still... that girl was under-age. So there's nothing strange about him being involved. But when I was arrested, there were no other Vice Detectives. Do you think it was a set-up? There's something going on that doesn't meet the eye. Very quickly, they decided that Sonoda's death was accidental... even though there are many unanswered questions. And there is definitely the possibility of homicide. And yet, Homicide Detectives were never involved. So somebody is behind all this? Maybe we should investigate through the distribution network of those videos. Let me do it... You need to lie low for a while. If they bust you again, you're history. I trust you. It's impossible to tell you where the tapes come from. That's the rule of this industry... 'Silence is golden'. I know, but that's why I'm asking you. To be honest... I'm a big fan of the girl in the uniform, the one who gets it ripped off. - I want her autograph. - Friend... - Yes? You're too old for this behaviour. Don't underestimate me... Do you know what I could do? I could report this to the police. Old man, understand the consequences for doing that. I am prepared for it. Perhaps if you... If you just whispered in my ear, just like talking to yourself... I feel like talking to myself. You'll feel better if you hold this money. I wonder if that was Chima, from Shinjuku... Chima from Shinjuku... Rotten bastard! Teacher! Help me! There's the money. You think we're yakuza? But we do business the right way. You work for us... and we pay you. Let's do business together again soon. Help! Keep your face to the camera. Scream for help. Help! What are you looking for? Me? I was... I was hoping to buy some toluene from you. For yourself, an old guy like you...? Are you fucking with me? No, no. It's a graduation gift for my grandchildren. Gift?! I never heard of a grandpa buying drugs for his grand kids. It might be a pathetic story, but listen... Domestic violence. When they run out of toluene, they become uncontrollable. My wife went away... and I'm all alone in that hell. I understand... $30 for a bottle. I have exactly $30. Come on. The police are sweeping the area. We'd better go. How did you know that? None of your business. You'd better get lost, too. I couldn't believe my eyes... They're selling drugs, right out in the open. I saw it too... Nobody seems to care about it. Know what? Before the police came, the dealers were informed. They were beeped with a message, a tip-off of some kind. Somebody has tapped into the police system. The dealer has a big operation. Someone is providing information. I wonder why the Japanese police are tolerating this 'outlaw zone'... There's something big going on behind this. - Eh? Could you find that place again? We'd have to be really careful. Oh, this is good shit! The stupid musician was growing it in his back yard. Vice team made the bust after a two-year investigation. Now you can sell it... for a good profit. Are you sure it's safe? - Anyway, this stuff is logged as discarded. We shouldn't waste anything. That's right. We must utilize all our natural resources, eh? The profit will be divided 70/30. All right. We're here because the Nakita D. P. Is here. I remember last year, when Nakita District Police... won the award for the least criminal activity in the city. Whatever we do, criminals still repeat their behaviour, so the best answer is to control them, under our umbrella. Our relationship is good for a healthy nation. We're helping to keep Japan a safe country, eh? By the way, the Big Boss wants to set up another video session. You mean the high school porn? Yes. That was the best video of them all. He wants some more. - All right, we'll do it. - Great. But can you choose a quieter girl this time? Tell them to pick someone who can keep their mouth shut. I'm tired of cleaning up the mess afterwards. We are aware of that... We've already addressed the question of discretion... But now there are serious qualms about continuing. It'll be alright: the stuff will work its magic, like usual. The timing is good. We've got some shit coming over from Columbia. This stuff is 100% - there won't be any more complaints. Anyway, we'll shoot a great video, high class... We can get $20,000 for this one. It'll be terrific. This is 2A, this is 2A. AP in KK3. This is 3W. Go ahead. This is 2A, this is 2A. AP in KK3. Roger. Three Vice Squad detectives... non-uniformed, nosing around. I'll talk to them when I get back to the station. Nakita D. P. Is the best! Listen, it's Chuni... No problem. We'd better get going. What are the sales so far this month? Last month seemed to be a bit off. You guys are pushing too much... Alright, we'll work harder. Make sure you do. A police/yakuza team... Nothing could be worse. Bastards! I still think there's something more... Something bigger and darker. Maybe Sonoda was trying to tell me about it. And she was killed because of it'? She was forced into prostitution, but... I think... I think she was video-taped first, and then blackmailed. How can we expose the Big Boss... pull him out of the shadows? Through Assistant Detective Maeda. She needs to meet Rapeman. Keisuke... but we have no client. - There is a client. - Who? Sonoda. I gave her this amulet... Then she left it for me, on the bridge. This is the payment. I understand. That's enough for the job. Let's do it. What's the problem? What are you doing? - What is this? - In the car. Do you know what you're doing? Assaulting a police officer! A police officer? Police officers are supposed to save citizens... Tell me the relationship between the oops and Chima. - What are you talking about? - All right... You're a pig... a pig wearing a uniform to hide your identity. - Talk! - No! The list of the girls who are arrested by Imamura... They get the list... And then they blackmail the girls, forcing them into prostitution. Somebody else... Who else is involved? It's... It's... Who is the one who ordered the death of that innocent girl? Tell me! Talk! School girls... a lesbian show... Top boss will be there tonight. What are you doing? - Let me check your bag. - What? He thinks we're shoplifters. Go ahead... but when you don't find anything, we're going to sue you. I can't believe it! - Is this true? - We didn't do it. I can't believe it. You were arrested red-handed. If you admit to the crime, I know how to make things better. If you don't talk, then I'm forced to do my job. I'll take you to the juvenile detention center! Please wait. Let me talk to them, please. I can't wait. They're thieves, and I can't let them go. Please, sir. I will be responsible. Let me keep them. Teacher, what's going to happen to us? I can't avoid reporting this to your parents. The school will probably expel you. No! That's terrible! My family will disown me. Besides, we didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands... You were caught with stolen merchandise. But we didn't put those things in our bags. Maybe I know someone who can help you... Do you know a lawyer or someone who can help us? - Maybe... - Teacher! - We'll do anything. - Please help us. It's slippery; watch your step. Uncle! Imamura went upstairs; I was following him. Keisuke, what're you doing here? Assistant Maeda talked to Rapeman... She said the Big Boss would be here tonight, for a special show. A show? Maybe like the one Sonoda was in. It can't be. What's wrong? Two high school girls were arrested for shoplifting... They were framed by Imamura... and then Sakita showed up to talk to them. That's Sakita's job - she's in charge of discipline at school. This is more than a co-incidence. She seems too much involved. What're you trying to say? She wouldn't be mixed up in this! I don't know... Anyway, I'm going to check upstairs. Don't move from here. Trust me... Maybe everything will work out. What the hell are you doing here?! What?! You're the old geezer from the other night. I need more stuff... so... What? So you're sneaking around this place? But I need more stuff for my grand kids. Uncle, I told you it's dangerous. Why didn't you stay downstairs? Keisuke... Sakita is here, with those two students. Is there any other reason for her to be here'? Are you the one who can help us? I'm the one. I'm on your side. I'll help you more than you realise... Are you sure those girls are okay this time? I don't enjoy killing people. You didn't have to kill the last one. I had no choice. She was going to report the situation. - You would've got in trouble, too. - You cornered her. She panicked and wanted to get out... You will only use them once. I won't allow more than that. I understand. Here's this month's cut. What kind of freak do we have here? ls it ready? He has a mental disorder. No matter how successful a person is, he can't beat it. Maybe you're right... Let's see... The first one was a virginal high school student. And now this time, a threesome with two virgins. I can't wait to see what happens the next time! Maybe he'll want an elementary school girl or something! Then teacher Sakita will have to get a transfer to elementary school. Don't screw around... This is the last time. Wake up! You're a dirty teacher... You can't go back and pretend like nothing has happened. I'm going to keep this secret. It's too late for you to get out! If you try it, you'll be killed. Wait, wait, wait! Sakita is just nervous now. I don't blame her. She was trained as an educator. She must be wrestling with her conscience. Mika's case was a bit too much for her. Let's calm down now. Here you go... Try this. I have enough for all year long. Even stubborn teachers can't help themselves when faced with that. Just like a monkey and masturbation. Teacher! Help us! Teacher! Who are you?! Go. Run. This show is well-planned this time. Who's making all that racket? What's going on'? Who the hell are you?! Just a citizen who still believes in justice. Justice is power. That is what a corrupt detective like you believes. Justice is the path decent people walk. Let's cut through the shit... Let me show you the real path of justice. - Is this the Big Boss? - No. Did you ever think about the feelings of the girls... who were violated in this room? - Forgive me, please. - Forgive you'? Do you think your sins are forgivable? I was pulled into this quicksand. When I tried to escape... I couldn't see the way out. Say whatever you want... Who is the Big Boss'? Leave me alone! You couldn't see clearly because you're an addict. Your inability to function... created a string of victims. Do you understand the terror of those poor girls... Their terror as they screamed for help? Do you feel it? Can you feel the pain... The pain of the girls who trusted you? A woman like you... who wears the mask of a teacher. You're nothing but a bitch, on a collision course with hell! Tell me... who is the Big Boss? Who's the one who ordered the death of innocent Sonoda? Keep your face to the camera. Scream for help. - Help! You've gone too far. I was so into the show, but now you've ruined my mood. Shut the fuck up... you pervert! How many people have cried because of you? Wait... Let's talk... You seem to be brave... Why don't we become partners? Then I could cover up anything you might do... even murder. Think of the possibilities... with my power and authority. Let's enjoy life together! Who do you think I am?! Sick bastard! Stop, Keisuke! Stop! When the law is powerless, I will punish the guilty. Is this the Big Boss behind the operation? How sad. Police Captain and Detective Dealing Drugs. Dirty Female Teacher Disbarred. Keisuke must have felt very bad... Now Mika can rest in heaven. I'm sorry I couldn't help her. Don't blame yourself... You're the only one who believed in her. I think she's also thankful to you. Please... live for her. Be strong. Thank you, teacher. I will be strong for her. Translation by Yuko Mihara & Tom Weisser.
