So exactly what does a man say when you've taken 38 years of his life and thrown it away without so much as a thank you? Well, I don't think you wantme saying what I said exactly, but it sure did feel good to say it. Yes, sir. I'm sure you're sure it did. Mmm-hmm, and anybody who wants to can go ask him what I said because I don't care who knows it. What they did was not right. Not to me or none of the other boys. I put my back into the plant. I missed a lot of stuff I will never have back. I was never young when I was there, but I spentup what I had left of it when I was there. I don't know why I never tried to leave earlier. I think it's because we was all in it together it felt like . Well, if that ain't the point of it all. You know, I may be sitting pretty now, I can't complain. I want for nothing. But I've been there more times than I can count. I know what it's like going down that tunnel with no end in sight. Now, life, I mean, it puts you through the wringer, but all you can do is make the best of what it gives you. You got to buckle your ass down, find your people, grab that silver lining and hold onto it for every damn bit of life that you're worth. Ain't that right? That's a way you say it, I guess . Thank you for calling KTXJ. How may I help you? One last thing, old timer. Do you have any wisdom for our young folks out there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I suppose let's hear it. You know, I heard him say it, but looking back, I figure I really do regret the things I didn't do more the little things I did do. I know. That's right. Well, that's a nugget, a front porch wisdom if I've ever heard it. Thanks for the talk, old. Are you have yourself a good night's keep on doing what you're doing for the rest of you out there.

Anyhow, as you all surely know by now, there's nothing I love more than hearing from you folks out there, almost those and lonely nights that you've been real talking to. Not sure what's going on out there, but I'd sooner rather give my right arm than I'll leave you folks hanging.
