Aki Avni Tinkerbell Need a ride? Edan Alterman Asi Dayan 'Bye, thanks. So how long are you on leave for? Two days. Will you be here, at the settlement? -Yeah, most of the time. -Good. Okay, 'bye. See you. Music Yonatan Bar-Giora Editor Tova Asher Cinematographer Ofer Inov Producers David Mandil & Eyal Shiray Director Joseph Cedar I thought we'd make up a company song, like an anthem. Sure, and maybe a badge too? Could we do that? A special badge? First of all, there is no company yet. Second, this isn't summer camp. It's the army. Third, I don't want badges, don't want any songs' I don't want my men singing, okay? I don't want them singing. What's wrong with singing? It helps build morale. Leave it to us. We'll make up the song. Menachem the company commander Stop it. Enough, Pini. Enough, Itamar. Stop it. First let them approve this company, then we'll worry about songs. - Menachem the company commander... -Stop it, Pini. Get dressed. - You'll catch cold, get pneumonia. -This warms me up. Okay, that's the song. Enough. That's the song. Did you tell him already? Tell me what? The rabbi asked me to meet his daughter. -Who, Michal? -Yes. -And? -And what? -Did you meet? -No. Maybe on Shabbat. I'm having dinner at the rabbi's. I still can't believe it. Congratulations, brother. I'm happy for you. -Is it time? -No. Three more minutes. - You can feel it too, can't you? -Feel what? Big things are about to happen. You'll get the company in the end, maybe I'll get engaged. Next time you're home everything will work out. You'll see, things will work out. What's happening? Wait, wait. - Hi. -Hello. -He's waiting for you. -Thanks. Menachem, come on in. Here, taste this. . It's homemade. They've approved our company. They have a few conditions, but it's more or less what we wanted. -Is something bothering you? -No, no. I'm... okay. I'm fine. It's just... I'd like to speak to my commanding officer first. I shouldn't be going over his head. This is very important to me. You know that. We didn't send you to be an officer just to check rifles for dirt. This is the spearhead. I want 16-year-old kids to dream about joining your company. Not any of the elite units but the religious company. I'm giving you the pick of the crop of the yeshiva students. That's a privilege no other commander has in the army. Use it well and make history. You don't have to ask for permission. You're a commander, you're an officer, a leader. What do they say in the army? "If they offer it, take it. " You have to know how to take. Aren't you going to taste it? Very spicy. Spicy is good. May this time be a time of mercy and favor I don't know how they approved this. It's a militia, not a company. It's no militia. It's like the Druze have their own unit, the Bedouins have the Bedouin unit and now we have a unit. We're not inventing the wheel. Don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with your friends. They're good for the regiment. Their motivation is high, they put their souls into it, they want to prove they're the best. I was like that once, you know. But I don't like this rabbi. I want you to promise me that this rabbi stays out of my base. Benny, I take the responsibility. Look, the rabbi stays a rabbi, but I'm the company commander. This Rabbi Meltzer, what makes him dangerous is not that he's a fanatic. On the contrary. The man's completely sane, he's brilliant. Do you understand? Let me explain this to you. We used to automatically look for the eccentrics, the ones who raise sheep and think they live in the Bible. But we have no problem with them. We can identify them. Meltzer is another matter. Suddenly a disciple of his pops up at the D.A.'s. Another disciple suddenly gets a column in the paper. See, what just two years ago seemed crazy is now finding its way in through the back door. The line between the normal and the abnormal has moved. I can't take this rain much longer. Let's go back. Let's give it a few more minutes. Michal, is that you? -Don't you have a robe? -It's in the laundry. -Pinchas is my student, a special student. -I know. Say, are you seeing someone? No. You're wasting your time. It won't do you any good. Go home and talk to her. Shabbat Shalom. Sometimes our boys have to pray in strange places. For instance, in a tank, or in an armored personnel carrier. Even at the, bus station, where the mind is set on the big question: When will the bus arrive, when will it leave? But the heart... the heart is in Jerusalem. Of course their prayer is wanted and welcome. But a Jewish soul yearns to return and pray in the very home of the Shekhina! My father, God rest his soul, had a few students who wanted to go up and pray at that "place. " They were considered crazy and he was considered "the crazies' rabbi. " But today there are a few hundred boys... and they are not considered so crazy. Neither is their rabbi. That's it, my friends. This is the process! When there will be tens of thousands of boys wanting to go and pray at the Temple Mount, then we won't be considered crazies anymore, but, as they say, "the norm. " Michal, Michal. - Hello. Shabbat Shalom. -Shabbat Shalom. How are you? -Okay. - How did you sleep. - Okay. -I didn't sleep at all. -Pinchas, I... - Pini. You can call me Pini. -Please stop. -Stop what? Stop. Stop... marrying me. I don't want to hurt you. Maybe I'd better go now. Pini? Get something from the Kiddush, something sweet. It's a punishment. Nothing happens without a reason. I had to suffer a few blows to understand that. But finally I did. What did you understand? That there is meaning to suffering in this world. That's all. That's ridiculous, Pini. -You're beginning to worry me. -I don't expect you to understand. Listen to me, Pini. First thing you need to do is find the best diabetes specialist to treat you. You're talking like some freak now. I can barely recognize you. Second, get up, get dressed, put your shoes on, get back to studying. Get back to yourself. You have to fight, you're rotting in here. Fight? Fight what, Menachem? Fight diabetes? Fight the fact that Michal doesn't want me? All right. Tell me how to fight that. -What about you? Been home yet? -No. I'm taking the last bus out. -Hi. -Hello. Going to Jerusalem? -Yes. And you? -I am, too. -The bus should be here any minute. -I know. I live here. Are you afraid to be seen with me? -Excuse me? -I asked if you?re afraid to be seen with me. -What do you mean, with you? -I don't know. Maybe... Are you angry with me? No. Why should I be angry with you? Look, Michal... What's up? Are you getting in? -What's up, are we getting in? -I don't think so. Thanks, no. Okay, you live here. Is there a place where we can talk quietly? Yes. I won't bite you. Is this the house Itamar and Rachel are building? I think so. Maybe not. No, no, this is it. Could you lower the flashlight? Why don?t you sit? You're making me nervous. I feel like I'm being interrogated. I prefer to stand. I don't want to interfere in your thing with Pini... unless I can help. I didn't want to hurt him. But you did. -He feels humiliated. -Try for a moment to see my side. Think I enjoy being the prize for the current Yeshiva genius, a kind of bonus my father gives his chosen student? It's humiliating for me, too. Perhaps if you gave him a chance you wouldn't feel this way. I'm not attracted to him. Does that mean anything to you? I don't know. Pini is an amazing person. There's no one like Pini. Your father says that a mind like his comes once in a generation. -You really idolize him. -I have no problem idolizing him. It's pathetic. Everyone idolizes each other here. I shouldn't be here. Maybe I'd better go. It's strange, everything's so simple with you. Black and white. Don?t you ever have doubts? I have doubts, then I decide. Maybe for me the doubting stage is short, that's all. And now, do you have doubts? What do you mean? Nothing. -What are you doing? -I don't know. Maybe I just want to see you doubt a bit. Want me to stop? No. Who's in there? Hi, it's me. It's okay, everything?s okay, Itamar. Unbelievable what goes on in this settlement. -He scared me. -Good God! So where will you sleep tonight? -You're late. -Yes, a little. Okay, I'm going to pray and then I'm out of here. I have to start getting organized. Weren't you supposed to leave yesterday? Don't ask. Listen, I wanted to tell you you're right about what you said yesterday. I mustn't give up on Michal. The rabbi wants us to be together. I can't disappoint him. I'm going down to eat. -Ever hear of a Rabbi Meltzer? -Sure. We should keep an eye on these guys. Is that why you?re here tonight? Listen, Benny. I was approached. They showed me all kinds of scenarios. This rabbi is dangerous. He wants to build the Third Temple. Nonsense. Ask anyone religious, he'll say he wants to build the Temple. Your grandfather didn't want to build the Temple? That doesn't make him dangerous. Well, they think it's serious. Know what I think? They're panicking over nothing. They're dying for something to happen. But I'm telling you, nothing's going to happen. Menachem is as straight as they come. You know, what you're telling me now really infuriates me. I trust Menachem blindly. Don?t you even have a little doubt? Because I'm pretty scared by all this. One incident and I'll dismantle this company myself. If you dismantle the company, I'll see it as a lack of trust in me. I'm behind him, Doron. He built the best companies I've ever seen. Right. That's exactly what scares them. We abhor the word "war. " Killing is not our job. What are we? Militarists? Militants? What are we, battle lovers? People feel that the most moral thing is to talk about the value of life, about bereavement, about peace. That's the moral shield against the evil, ugly side of war. Maimonides says: "Let him not think of his wife or children, but erase their memory from his heart and go to war. " A man must remove all private matters from his mind. What will happen to him, what will happen to the other. Now he's not a private person. He's part of the community of Israel. He who continues to be engrossed in his private matters will be afraid. But when a man goes to battle, when he's completely exalted with ideal he is fighting for, he is so full of it, full of determination, of bravery, that it removes all fear from his heart. Whoever is not willing to give his life, whoever does not know that sometimes the dead lion is more alive than the living dog, will stay a dog. Goon in. Like a lion. Like a lion. -Hello, Michal. -Pini. I want to talk to you. This time I promise not to faint. Maybe you'd better sit down. Just in case. Look, I... I've been thinking about it a lot, trying to figure out what happened. And I... I think I understand. I was arrogant. That's all. It was arrogant to think you'd be interested in me just because your father asked me. So, first of all I want to apologize. You've no idea how sorry I am, for maybe embarrassing you... and I want to apologize... No, I should apologize. No, no, I want to apologize. We just went too fast. I mean, I went too fast. Menachem also helped me understand that. One mustn't give up. So what do you say, Michal? Let's start over, okay? From the beginning, slowly. It's amazing. -It's hell on earth. -What? I haven't one good memory from this place. That's why I brought you here. I know everyone thinks this is a great place to grow up in. My father always said that although it's difficult for grownups, it's a paradise for children. As though all a child needs is a view. "The land of Israel is bought with pain. " The more it hurts, the more my father enjoys it. Look, it's true. Idealists don't really suffer. But around every idealist there are people who do suffer, who do hurt. Toward the end of my mother's illness, she begged him to return to the city. She begged. She didn't even have a bathroom here. But my father said that if he left, the settlement would fall apart. The settlement would fall apart? My mother's going through chemotherapy and what's falling apart in my father's mind is the settlement? Do you understand why this place isn't pretty in my eyes? "The land of Israel is bought with pain. " I guess that's what my father would say if I were killed here in a terrorist attack. -So why don?t you leave? -Where would I go? Move to the city. Will you come with me? -Is that an invitation? -It's up to you. Do you love me? -You're blushing. -No, I'm tanned. Now you?re blushing. Do you want to kiss me? Let's give him some time to get used to the idea. I don't care if you don't talk to him at all. I'm not the one who needs his approval. Menachem the company commander. Hi, what's up? -Hello, Michal. -Hi, Pini. -Hello. -How are you? I brought you a present. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Do you want to... I think I'll leave you two alone. No. I think I'll leave you two alone. You need to talk. -See you. -See you. -Do you think I embarrassed her? -What? What's up? Is everything okay? -Is there something you want to tell me? -No. Not now. I... do want to talk to you, but not now. I'll come to the room. -Is my opinion important to you? -Very. The yeshiva is a family, Menachem. Pinchas is a brother. He's not in good health, you know that. But know that his strength in learning is no less than yours in soldiering, no less. One day Pinchas will be a great scholar in the Torah. You?ll command the company, climb the ranks and Pinchas will be a great scholar in the Torah. What you?re doing to Pinchas is murder. Menachem, go back to the army. Put all your strength, all you fervor, into the company. That's what's needed now. -Well? -Not now. -Are you leaving? -Are you awake? Are you fleeing the scene? I'm going back to the base. You're not taking what my father said seriously, are you? Very seriously. So that's it, you got an order? Look, your father's right. Maybe you can hurt Pini. I can't. You're hurting me, not Pini. No, that's not what I meant. I need time, I need time to think. No. I won't give you time. You decide quickly, remember? So decide. I have no choice, Michal. You have all the choices in the world. I'm here, in front of you. Menachem... Michal, Michal, wait. Michal. This is no way to leave home. We need to talk. It's too late now. Don't you want to hear what I have to say? Truthfully? No. Don't be fresh. I'm sorry. Come, Michali, let's go home and talk. Enough, Dad. Let me leave. Meet Michal Meltzer. She served here last year. Meet Zofiah, Massuah, Elisheva. Someone always sleeps at home, so there's a free bed. My brother's studying at your father's Yeshiva. He thinks the world of him. Wait for us in the car. We'll be there in a minute. - How are you? -Fine. Glad to hear it. Listen, I know my daughter. Although she'll deny it, in many ways she's similar to me. What I want to ask of you is difficult. I want you to swallow your pride and try to speak to her again. She's not interested in me. Don't give up, persist. She'll appreciate that. Rachel wants to move in before Passover. No way. I think there's no chance. Better to stay in the mobile home, right? Tell me... hypothetically speaking, yes..? If Menachem and I were planning something, would you want to be part of it? -What do you mean, planning something? -First I need your answer. Can?t you tell me? No, if I tell you, you're in. Is that what the rabbi wanted to talk to you about? Among other things. So the rabbi knows about it. It's not at a practical stage yet but he supports the idea. Is everything okay between you and Menachem? That's good. About what you asked, if the rabbi is behind it, I'm in. Great, but meanwhile, not a word. Not even to Menachem. -Amazing, huh? -Never seen anything like it. He has this magic word. He tells them "I'shma," and it's as though you stuck dynamite up their ass. -What does he tell them? -"I'shma," something like that. I dunno. Tell me, what's this "I'shma"? It means "for something," "for the sake of something. " Yes, but for the sake of what? For the sake of God?s Name. I don't understand. You lie here now, in the mud, for the sake of God? -Let's say you?re eating breakfast. -Well? Why do you eat? I dunno, 'cause I'm hungry, to have strength. Okay, to have strength. What do you need strength for? I don't know. If I don't eat, I'll be hungry. I don't like being hungry. See, that's precisely the difference between us. Forgive me for... Really, I don't want to offend you, but all day long you hang around here, eating snacks. You feel good, feel bad. I don't know, with us it's different, you see. I eat so that I'll have strength. I need strength to learn the Torah. I learn the Torah for the sake of God. That's the ultimate goal. That's "I'shma. " That's why I'm lying in the mud now. Get it? "I'shma. " Don't bother with the used bikes. Add 2000 shekels and buy a new one. For now I'm just looking. I don't even have my license yet. Thanks. Do you need an instructor? Wait a minute! We need to talk, but not here. Somewhere quiet. I don't think I'm going anywhere quiet with you. Tell me what you want. I'm not going anywhere with you. It's Menachem. You're in a critical place for us. Usually, when we approach someone, it's because we think it's in their interest to cooperate with us. -In your case your interest is clear... -Not to me. Your cooperation could save Menachem a lot of trouble, I think you understand that. So what do you say? I don't know. How's the pay at the Secret Service? Because I want to buy a scooter. Do they pay well? Here's my card. If you?ll want to talk to me, you can leave me a message and I'll contact you. -Shabbat Shalom, Company D. -Shabbat Shalom, commander, sir! -Shabbat Shalom, Michal. -What are you doing here? I'm here for Shabbat so I came over. Want to come in? I thought you might want to take a walk. I'm not feeling well. Do you want me to come in? Come in. -It's nice in here. -It's a cage. Are you sorry you came here? You can go, you know. What's going through your head? You look at me and what do you think about? -I think that you're beautiful. -I'm beautiful? What's beautiful about me? I'm serious. What's beautiful about me? Is it my nose, my eyes, my hair? Maybe my body? What's beautiful to you, what? You know, once I happened to see the great Rabbi Meltzer naked. I was little, but I remember. We went to the separate beach in Haifa, my mother decided that half the children will go with Dad to the men and half will go with her to the women. We used to go bathe in the sea, bathe, not swim, God forbid. So Dad would take me to the men's showers to wash off the sand. I never understood why I couldn't make as much foam with my soap as all the men. Know what I mean? I know what is beautiful to you. When you look at me closely, you see my father. The great Rabbi Meltzer. I look like him, don't I? -That's' not true, Michal. -I?m right. You can't look at me without seeing my father. Stop it, will you? Why? I rather like i. t. It's true love. Go, Pini. You shouldn't have come here. -I'm not going. -You're not going? So I'll go. You can stay here if you like. Blessed be You, Lord, who separates the sacred from the profane. Hello, a good week to you. I have no idea, I just walked in. One moment, I'll see. She's not here. There's no one here. I have no idea. There's no one here. Try again later. Good-bye. It's time we talked. Aren?t you supposed to be in the army? I'm leaving the company. I'll complete the final exercise with them and then leave the army. Did you talk to the rabbi? That's what I'm here for. I've been holding it in for several months. I can't take any more. The rabbi stole my soul, Pini. I want Michal. I want to talk to him about that, too. Forgive me, brother. I've simply had it. The rabbi wants you to continue with the company. My decision is final. I'll do the final exercise with them and then go home. From here I'm going to Michal, to tell her what I told you. I just hope she?ll take me back. You can be angry with me. But I... I also expect you to understand me. I understand you, Menachem. I understand you're weak. Do what we discussed, we have no other time. We're doing it. I dunno, Menachem is acting weird. You sure he's in? Tell me, do you think he's stupid? He knows what he?s doing, believe me. Just do what we decided. Halamish from Second. Halamish from Second, over. Roger, over, second. Can you change the frequency? Wait. Go ahead, Mookie. -Where are you? -On the road to Jerusalem. Roger. Drive to the base. I need you pronto. There's a problem. I'll be there later, you... Negative, negative. Get over here now. I need you here now. -At last. -What's up? Will someone talk to me? I'm talking to you. What are you doing? Your friend went into the arms depot, greeted the guard and took four cases. We took out some empty cases for tomorrow's exercise, that's all. Good thing they didn't shoot me. He's holding me here as though I was one of his soldiers. Is anything missing? Well, you counted. Is anything missing? I want to check his stuff. -What stuff? -I want to check his gear now. No problem. But if he touches my stuff, I'm out of the company. There's a limit. Wait, wait, wait. Nothing's missing, right? There's no reason to do a check. But Mookie's right. You don't take cases out of the depot in the middle of the night. Itamar, wait for me in the tent. I?ll be right there. I've never been so humiliated in my life. What are you doing to me? Look, I didn't get you over here for nothing. Something weird is going on. He hangs around in the depot, gets all kinds of strange phone calls. I'm worried. The guy scares me. Yes? It's me. Don't hang up, just listen to me for a minute. Tomorrow night we're going on our final exercise. We'll be at the Western Wall around 7:00 a. m. I can't start this march without knowing that you'll wait for me there. I?ve got to talk to you. You hurt me, Menachem. I refuse to get hurt again. I was an idiot. Give me a chance. -I have something important to tell you. -I'm tired of important things. So have something trivial and idiotic to tell you. Trivial and idiotic is good. Will you be there? I need time to, think. Listen, we'd better hurry if you want to leave before dark. I'm waiting, for Itamar to finish loading. There's a briefing in ten minutes. You, know, I'm still not sure about what happened last night. He could have found empty cases elsewhere. -There are piles of them by the mess hall. -What's bothering you? You think he took something from the depot? We checked, nothing's missing. I feel awkward about him as it is. He joined the company as a favor to me. Do you know that? Hell, the man has a wife and kid at home, and I give him the run-around over some empty case. What do you want? You feel awkward. Okay, I get it. When did you say the briefing was? -In six minutes. -Right, wake me before. Come on, come on. Quickly. Faster, faster. Load it. Go on, go on. It'll be around here. -Okay, I'm done. -Are the soldiers ready? Yes, I told them to wait for the call. They're ready. Sit down. Good I want the whole company ready, with their gear, at 5:40. I want to leave at 5:45 p. m. Okay, Itamar. You can head out to Jerusalem. Get there by daylight and prepare a proper ceremony for us. And if nothing goes wrong, we'll be there just before 7:00 a. m. Leave? You don't need me here anymore? No, go and join with the headquarters' company commander. Good luck, guys. Don't be late. Company D, today you are nearing war. I want to tell you that war is not always against an enemy. War is first and foremost against yourselves. A brave, strong soldier is one who can overcome his own weaknesses. And that is the real battle. "He who is fearful and soft of heart should return to his home and not weaken his brother's heart like his own. " Is there anyone here who doesn't want to go? No, company commander, sir. Duty cadet, did I hear a murmur from the company? -Two-three! -No, company commander, sir! Good luck. Mookie, take your position. If Menachem is putting on an act, he's a great actor. He managed to confuse me. I don't understand a thing anymore. Listen to me. You don't have to understand, just do what we discussed. There's a very clear division of tasks and you should trust the rabbi. -And this comes from him? -Yes, it comes from him. Don't worry, I haven't come to try again. On the contrary. I came to say good-bye. Perhaps this whole thing was a mistake to begin with. I understand that now. You know something? I didn't expect it, but I feel relief. A kind of freedom. Halamish-One from Genossar-One. Over. Roger. Over. One here, what's your location? About one kilometer from destination. Over. Roger. Stop where you are. I'm on my way to you. Do you read? Roger. I read. I'm a minute from the road. I'll wait for you there. Over. Negative, negative. Stop and wait where you are. Out. Roger. Will do. What's up? No idea. Come on. Go in first. I'll hand you the bag. Just a minute,. I have to talk to my wife. How can you talk to her now? We don't have time. What's the matter with you? Is everything okay? No, everything's not okay, Not at all. Itamar, listen to me. We don't have time. We can't stop now. Pini, look. I'm scared to death, I... Look at me. My hands... Go on in without me, I'll help you... Listen to me, listen, we're going in now. Don't think about anything. Zero, nothing. That's exactly what the rabbi was talking about. That's what he was talking about. Remember? All becomes insignificant compared to what we're doing. Think only of that. We are going to put history back on its proper course. After this, everything will change. This is a privilege. What we're doing is a privilege. And it's a privilege that will be missed if we don't go in now. Come on, I can't do this without you. Come on, let's go in. Nobody move! Stay where you are, no one moves! Each soldier will put down his weapon and raise his hands. -This is an order! -Who are you? Put your weapons on the ground and raise you hands above your heads! I won't take orders from anyone who won't identify himself! Menachem, do what they say. It's me, Benny. This is an order. Put down your weapon. Hands in the air. Okay, hands in the air. Raise your hands, Menachem, raise your hands. I don't know what this is about. It came from very high up. Do what they say. I'm with you. It's nonsense, Eitan. I know my students Not one of them could be involved in something like that. I'm telling you, it's nonsense. I'm positive. I still need you to come with us. If it was nonsense, I wouldn't be here. I'll go get my shoes. Let me through. What's the matter with you? This is crazy. Let me through. What's the matter with you? Menachem. Where's Pini? I don't know where Pini is. Did I hurt you? I?m sorry. Menachem, calm down. You're an officer, not a child. Calm down, focus. You were supposed to meet him last night, yes? Where? Where are the explosives? Menachem. Calm down, okay? Sorry. Where did you plan to meet him? I didn't set up a meeting with him, I don't know what you?re talking about. We didn't plan to meet. I don't know where the explosives are. -You met him last night, right? -I don't know anything. I'm an officer in the IDF. We're on the same side. I'm an officer in the IDF. I didn't do anything. We're on the same side. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Where are the explosives? Where are the explosives? Where did you plan to meet him? I know everything, where is he? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know anything. It won't work. I need more time with him. Look, except for the tip from Michal, no one has heard of this plan. No explosives, no plan of action, nothing. Sivan, let's get Michal into his cell and see what happens. Are you okay? They're listening to us. I have nothing to hide. I've told them everything I know. What did you tell them? Pini told me. I had no choice. I told them. What about Pini? He came to my place. What did he tell you, Michal? About your plan. I had to report it. Our plan? What plan? What did he tell you? -He said you were planning something. -Who's "you"? What did you tell them, Michal? I'm scared, Menachem. What have you done to me? Where?s Pini now? I don't know. He said he was going to meet Itamar. Who's Itamar? Who the hell is Itamar? Menachem covered for him, don?t you get it? Menachem has no part in this. You don't know him. It's a mistake. -A mistake. -Yes. -You say it's a mistake. -Yes, a mistake. You said you checked the depot, you went through the lists. Did it cross your mind that someone messed with the lists? Look, it's simple. Aside from you, only Menachem has access to those lists. They stole half the depot from under your nose. I see. I see. Close off the Old City. We're not waiting any longer. -Start talking, I know about Itamar. -It's a mistake. I don't... Say "mistake" one more time and I'll bust your head open. Where is he? I didn't plan to meet him. That's what I'm trying to tell you. He?s acting on his own. Maybe with someone else, but not with me. You'll have to believe me, I can help you. Only I can help you. So which of the two should I believe? Can you tell me that? If Pinchas was planning something, he wouldn't have told anyone. Not me, certainly not Michal. He'd do it. That's all. -Do what? Blow up the mosques? -No. He wouldn't do that, no. They stole explosives. Someone's going to blow something up. I'm not inventing this stuff. Pini and Itamar are running around with 40 kg of explosives. Do you think they could do such a thing without Menachem? They wouldn't do anything, with or without Menachem. I know my students. This whole story is ridiculous. You're not helping me. I want to help you. I don't know how. My students would not do something like that. They're out of your control, Zvi. Understand that. For years you've been feeding them "Temple, Temple, Temple. " Finally a few students go and do something about it. People listen to you. Maybe what I say sounds radical to you, but my students know how to interpret it. The Temple is not a building, the Temple Mount is not a mountain. It's an idea. And my students understand that. You don't need explosives for an idea. I'm asking you specifically about Menachem. He says he wants to help us. Can I believe him? Yes. Your friend is cooperating. -Did he confess to anything? -No, but he knows where they are. -Doron, I want to talk to him. -It's out of my hands now. Someone else is making the decisions now. Not me. Get it? You're going in. Come on. We have very little time. I'll give you a few pointers, then we go. In principle, we now have the go-ahead. Firstly, apparently we?re dealing with suicide attackers, so if the targets are identified simultaneously, you open fire and kill them according to the drill. - It's too risky. - Shut your mouth. Let me just say one thing... -I told you to shut your mouth! -I have something important to say. -I said, shut up!. -I have something to say. It's too risky. Leave him alone. I don't have time for this. Just let me say one thing. A military raid won't work here. You haven't been in those tunnels. No man has been inside them in 2,000 years and you think you'll identify targets? and you think you?ll identify targets? You won't identify yourselves in there. You can't make any mistakes here. For God's sake, do you get it? Stop being so sure of yourselves or you?ll cause the biggest bungle ever to happen in this country. So you don't really trust me. Okay, I can understand that. You have no choice because this operation is going to fail. You all know that. We need to reach them and talk to them. I believe I can persuade them that no one knows about this. Then maybe there's a chance they'll agree to come out of the tunnels as though nothing happened. But for that to work, I have to get to them first, now. I also need Michal with me for that. Enough. I'm putting a stop to this charade. You have no other chance. What is there to lose? -Give me Mookie. -Sivan, please, let me run this briefing. Enough, damn it!. Sivan, get Mookie and Michal over here. He's right, we have no choice. Sivan, I don't have time for games. I need you with me. Menachem's right. I tell you, we have no choice. You're assuming, based on nothing, that Menachem's clean. I don't accept this assumption. Pini's sick and Itamar could never put together a bomb by himself. I think Menachem's going down there to finish up the job. He?s taking her with him. If he's going to blow himself up, what does he need her for? You're making mistake. It's your responsibility and I won't argue. But I think you're taking an unnecessary risk. I don't think it, I'm sure of it. What you're doing isn't professional. You're making a mistake. I stand behind this decision, Sivan. Okay, we have an hour and a half of quiet. Go now and God help us. All stations, proceed. Are you with me? Just tell me if you believe me or not. I'm here to keep an eye on you. That's my job here. I don't know who to believe. Michal? Eye contact, keep eye contact. Michal first, then you. We have to gain some time. As soon as they come in, everything explodes. Come with me, come on. I know what I'm doing. "I'shma. " Something's wrong, I'm telling you. Locate them, Alpha-one! Keep eye contact, I said. Give them an order to shoot on sight. Menachem shouldn't get to him. Once Pini hears something, he'll blow the charge. Let Menachem go on. We should kill both of them and put an end to this thing. Shoot on sight. Stop, Menachem. What happened here now, huh? You're not going anywhere without them. They'll kill him before he can say a word to Pini. It would never work. Mookie, I think I know exactly what's going on in Pini's head. Pini? The hell with Pini! Pini can't do a thing alone! Don?t you see what's going on here? How does he know we're going in the right direction, huh? I don't buy this story. I don't believe one word of his. I don't have time to try and convince you, Mookie. You?ll just have to believe me. I'm going to stop him. I swear, Menachem, you move and I?ll shoot you. -Stop. -Pini. It's me. Stop, Menachem. What are you doing, Pini? Don't come near me, Menachem. My hand is on the switch, I'll do it no matter what. So what are you waiting for? Why did you bring her? You still want to live, Pini, or you?d have done it already. No one knows we're here, we can walk out and... nothing happened. -Itamar is dead. -I know. We saw him. He was a good man. What you?re doing is crazy, Pini. Let go of the switch and talk to me. It's not crazy. It's the right thing to do, I can feel it in my body. I know you, Pini. You don't really believe what you just said. You're doing this because you're a selfish, small-minded man. She doesn't understand. Do me a favor and take her away. Leave me alone. I don't want to hurt you. You're my friend, Pini. I'm staying here. The rabbi knows we're here. He sent us to stop you. You're lying, Menachem He's not lying. My father is against what you?re doing. So he's weak too. He's a coward too. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! -Finish it off. -No. You're taking an unnecessary risk. Put an end to it. I need a decision. Good morning. Are you Meltzer? As far as we're concerned, you're free. You can go home. I need to talk to Eitan. He knows who I am. I can help you. Go home.
