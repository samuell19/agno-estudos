I'm looking for Fiona. Is she here? And I thought you'd come looking for me. Come on. She's in there. Go on in. - Suzy, are you there? - Yeah. Why don't you come in? - He's a bit hairy. - Hey, would you like to meet the group? Couldn't I say hello later? - How long have you been in town? - Just arrived. Do you think you can make your way to the Pit Club tonight? You got out of the bed then? - Hello. - What did you come like that for? I thought you'd go back and change. Haven't you got anything better? I didn't know you'd be getting dressed up. Anyway, I haven't got anything else except a clean jumper. Oh, Jesus, you'd better come with me. Don't you ever get sick? Keep your hair on, are you frightened I'll eat him? Piss off. Come take your clothes off. What's the matter? They're girls. If I had tits like yours I wouldn't flash 'em about neither. Look, leave her alone. Here put this on. - Whose is it? - I don't know. Doesn't matter. She'll been doing some pulling, I expect. - What did she mean about pulling? - It's just an expression. She's probably frightened one of the group will fancy you. I just don't understand. Why should I want one of them? Don't you know how many girls would give their right arm to ball it with one of Forever More? These girls are trying to pull the group. To get off with them. - Is that what you do? - I did. But I don't, now. Somehow I just seemed to get involved with Lee. He likes me. I've been hung up on him a long time. - Do you live with him? - Yes. I was hoping, I could stay with you, for the time being. Till I find a place of my own. I thought you have a place. Why didn't you say something this morning? I didn't like to. Well, you can come back to the hotel. There's plenty of room there. - What's she doing here? - Slumming. - Can I get you anything? - No, thanks. Look, can't you see he's uptight? Why don't you leave him alone? Keep your hair on. Are you frightened I'll eat him? Piss off. - You played me. - What was that? It's a wild scene, isn't it? There's a lot of love in this room. Come on. Get out of it. - Why do you bother? - How do you mean? Surely it's easier to smoke readymade ones. Oh, sure, but these are special. At least, it stops me getting uptight with these freeloaders hanging around. Why don't you just tell them to go? Nothing to do with me. I can't say anything. Hey, come on. Who are all those people? I don't know. They make me sick. They just come and use as if they own the place. Here. You know, I don't really like you in that shirt. Tell you what, I'll find you a dress. Do you like this one? Try it on anyway. I'm going to have a bath. Okay. - Come on. Get in. - Don't be silly. Well, you'll have to get in now, won't you? Come on, hurry up. Hey, what's taking you so long? It's these! Fiona... What does Mnâ€œ do'? Nothing much. He's the road manager. They're all no-talent bums. He's supposed to see that everything is organised for the group, when they go on a gig. He's meant to see that people like those out there are kept away. Why, do you fancy him? - He seemed quite nice. - Well, he's a creep. - Have you seen Fiona? - She's in there. Thank you. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. You look sad. - What, for a job, you mean? - Yeah. I don't. Unless you can call looking after Lee a job. Well, how do you look after him? Well, you see, sometimes, when they go on a gig, they have to stay in an ordinary house. Some of the hotels won't let them in. I do a bit of washing, bit of cooking, lots of loving... I'm sorry, love. She only arrived in town this morning. - I'm sorry. Did I wake you? - No, man. You just interrupted the meditations. Join me. We could make a beautiful thing. - Man does not live by bread alone. - Maybe not, but I'm starving. I'll feed you. Follow me. - Where are we going? - Thought you were hungry, man? - I am, but... - Then I'll provide. Like the Great Maker. - What's your name? - Pogo. - Your real name. - That's it, man. Why do we have to leave the hotel, to get some food? We have to go where it's at. Why do we have to come all this way? Man, do you think hotels let you in with a pack on your back? I have enough trouble just getting in. - Do you always carry that guitar? - I thought it was yours, man. - That's why I picked it up. - Doesn't belong to me. We'd better take it back. The Lord moves in a mysterious way, man. - Do you sing? - No, but I'm going to learn. - I don't know that I'm that hungry. - Go ahead, man, eat it, it's good. - It's not bad. - Want some coffee? Got any money? - Where do you live, Pogo? - Under the stars, man. The world's my scene. Have you seen Onnie? Come on, give us this day our daily bounce, laddie, up. Aren't you getting ready then? I feel lazy. All right, let's hurry it up then. Got to get out. Can I have one? What's that noise? They're going on a gig, up north, somewhere. - You'd better get dressed. - Will they mind me coming along? No, I shouldn't think so. Jesus, thought you lot had cleared out hours ago. Come on. Pig. - Come on. We haven't got all day. - Drop dead. - My gear's over there. - Look, Lady Muck, you take your own things down. I've got enough arranging to do. What's eating you? What the hell's she doing here? Get her out before I throw her out. Hey, I told her she could come. She can, can't she? Since when have you been running the show? Well, I thought it'd be all right. You like her, don't you? Like her? Well, it didn't look like a hate-in you were having last night. Get this into your skull. She's not coming. That makes me look a right cow, doesn't it? Well... - You heard? - Yeah. There isn't anything I can do. I don't really know what to say. I thought he liked me. I thought he was marvellous. Till he left me lying on the floor. I know. He just gets a bit funny sometimes. You have to ignore him. What am I gonna do? I don't know. Haven't you got anywhere to go? I can find somewhere. Hey, I tell you what. A friend of mine's arriving tonight. Her group's playing at The Pit. They always follow up Forever More. You could talk to her. What can she do? Well, you could probably stay around at her place till next Tuesday when we get back. That'll give me a chance to sort out that bastard. Can I take the things you gave me? Of course, you can. Hey, we'll be staying at the Royalton Hotel next week. So, you better come there. Okay? - Do you know where I can find Lacy? - That bitch. Lacy? Hey, look what the wind blew in. Friend of yours? Thanks, sweetheart. Okay. - Do I know you? - No. Fiona's a friend of mine. - How is she? - She's fine. She's just gone up north... Spare me the details. Maybe I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be nasty. It's just she screws me up. Come on. Fiona thought maybe I could stay with you for a few days. Till she gets back. - When's that? - Next Tuesday. I don't see why not. - You been on the scene long? - I've only been in London two days. Who is she? - Where have you been all my life? - Stop fooling around. Take no notice of him, Suzy. Suzy? Nice name, Suzy. You really like that scrub look? You're not kidding. Well, drink her in. She's just leaving. - I thought you said I could stay. - You must have been dreaming. The sooner you get out of here, the better. Who let you in anyway? - I just came. - Well, now you're just leaving. Fuck off! Keep your cool. We shouldn't be in here, Pogo. Why not, man? There's no charge for admission. This is my home, man. Where are you going? I called upon the Lord and cried unto my God. He heard my voice and my cry came before Him. But God is uptight, man. He sees the ways of the world. The homeless living in rat-infested shacks while the fat cats make bread. The politicians sell arms while starvation and the stench of death fills their nostrils. The Lord says, their mouths are full of cursing, deceit, fraud. Under their tongues is corruption and vanity. They sit in the lurking places of the villages. In the secret places do they murder the innocent and poor. The Lord, man. Let the wickedness come to an end and establish the just. Let the sorrows of death compass me. And the floods of ungodly men made me afraid, man. For I have seen the wicked in great power. The wicked have drawn their swords and bent their bows to cast down the poor and needy. They speak not peace. But they devise deceitful matters against those that are quiet. But war is in their hearts. Their words, softer than oil, yet are there drawn swords! The workers of iniquity eat upon people as they bred. Oh, ye fat sons of bitches! How long will you love vanity and seek evil? Oh, ye pigs! But know ye that God has set apart him that is godly. While the ungodly shall perish, his mischief shall return upon his own head. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days. How they increase that troubles me! Hi. Oh, Pogo, I thought we'd lost you! No, man, I was sniffing out the evil. Have you got enough money to eat? We've got plenty, man. Let's have a feast. You always make me feel like I'm the only one that gets something. You are, man. Why are you so quiet, Pogo? His Lord, doth He meditate both day and night, man. - Whose Lord are you talking about? - No-one's. What if we go away somewhere? Where? There's nowhere that's any different to here, man. The world's full of ungodly people. You frighten me. Don't be afraid, man. Listen to the voice of my cry. Look at me straight before my face. Don't hide yourself in times of trouble. Well, you'd better snap out of it for a start. The graveyards are full of indispensable people. Look, I must go. I'm going to meet Lee. Will you be all right? Yeah. - Keep an eye on her, will you? - What the hell for? Look, just do something useful for once in your life. - You weren't much good last time. - I know. Why are you sitting here in the dark? Thank God this gig's over. - When's the next one? - Two days. Shit! You don't have to go back with the others. We walk, I suppose. - What's the matter with you, Lee? - Nothing. Let's go to bed. No, just let it go. Where are you going? To see Jimi. - What are you doing here? - Got one guess. Where's Jimi? I thought you were all hung up on Kip then. Not that I knew of. He thought so. Did you look in on Kip as you passed? No. Well, if you had, you'd have seen how hung up on me he is. The girls are queuing in the hall. - Where are you going? - Bed. Hey, listen. Jimi's gonna book us into an hotel. Go with him and make sure he doesn't book us into his aunt's boarding house. Come on, are you going to stand here all day? All right, piss off! Why do you always get Fiona to do your dirty work? Why did you take your clothes off this afternoon? I felt like it. You would. - Where are you off to? - Just going for a walk. Let's go, Rick. - Do I know you? - You should. This bitch here had hysterics because you spoke to me. Come on, let's go. - Where to? - Well, you've gotta change, haven't you? What the hell for? - Are you coming? - No, you go. What's the matter? Frightened? Where do I know you from? - You don't remember? - No. I came around to your dressing room when you were at The Pit. So did a hundred other girls. - You bastard! - Get lost. You heard him. Are they still in bed, yeah? How the hell would I know? Fiona is. Suzy didn't come back last night. Didn't she bed down with you then? Fuck off! Good screw then, is she? Did Jimi miss her, then? About as much as I'd miss the clap. You don't think she's got it, do you? With you then, was she? I thought I smelled coffee. Can I have some? Managed to crawl back then, did you? What the hell have I done? Getting on everybody's nerves. I'd like to know how. You're fucking around too much. God Almighty, Himself. Why don't you just piss off, Lee? I don't care if you screw yourself to death, but don't cause us any more trouble. Hypocritical bastard! You'd love me to ball you as much as the rest of them. What? Why don't you go to Fiona? Good, is she? Play it well? Washing up, then? I hope you got me a room to myself. Yeah. Next to mine. Do we have to wait until then? Hi. You'd better clear out before the roadie comes. You must be joking, I gave the manager a free screw to get back here. Jesus Christ! What's this? Come on, out! - Come on, go! - Hey! Hey! - Hi, Jimi. - Oh, come on! Three, four. Hang on, fellas, we're just changing tapes. Wonder when they'll finish. Oh, never. Look, I'm going for a coffee, are you coming? No, I'll stay for a bit. Okay, I'll be over the road. Can you tell Lee? - That's good. - That's enough for the day, I thinks. When's the mix? When's the mix, Kip? Next week? - Yeah, I think so. - I'm shooting off then. Hang on. - Where's Fiona? - She's gone for a coffee. She'll be waiting for you. Will she? I'd better go. Hey, have you seen Lee? Yeah, sorry, love, he was here a minute ago. Lee, are you in there? - Could I borrow your tweezers? - Yeah. Where have you been? Nowhere in particular. You didn't by any chance see Lee when you were nowhere in particular, did you? I asked you a question. What was that? You heard me. Something about Lee, wasn't it? Don't give me that "innocent little girl" act. You've been with him, haven't you? Why don't you ask him? He's back too, is he? I think I saw him on the way in. But you don't remember? Well, do you? Yes, I did see him. Why? Why what? You know bloody well! Why couldn't you leave him alone? I didn't go after him, if that's what you think. - Not much! - Not at all. - I've seen you with the others. - So? You weren't satisfied till you got him as well. The others weren't enough for you! I wish you'd shut up. I want you out of here. Really? You wouldn't be here in the first place if it wasn't for me. That's right. So you're bloody well leaving! - Why don't you cool off, Fiona? - I should cool off? You spend the afternoon with Lee and you tell me to cool off? What do you expect me to do? Kiss you? For Christ's sake, Suzy, I love him, do you understand? I'm sorry, Fiona, it's just one of those things. Can I help it if he likes me? You make me sick! Look, if you're not out of here in half an hour, I'll get Jimi to throw you out. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. Come on, let's have a drink. - There you are. - I'll bet. What's wrong with you? Just leave me alone. You don't mean that. Don't I? I waited for you this afternoon. How was I to know that? I left a message for you with Suzy. - Did you? - You know bloody well I did! Where did you go? I just went for a drink with Kip. Don't lie. Who's lying? I just went for a drink. Yeah, and what were you doing before that? What is this, some kind of interrogation? - You look nice. - Do I? You really do. - Would you like a refill? - Okay. She can't take her eyes off you. So what? You went with her, didn't you? Yeah. Are you happy now? How could you? - Just forget it. - I can't! What's the matter? Can't you leave her alone? - Oh, come on, cool it. - She's the one who needs to cool it. - Calm down. - Don't touch me! You knew he was mine. You knew it! Then you take him? And don't you touch me, either! You bitch! Let go! Let me go! Let me go! I'm just going to have a bath, then I'll start packing. No need to hurry. Sorry about last night. Well, that's got nothing to do with it. With what? I don't know what you're talking about. I'd rather you didn't come. You didn't want me, did you? Is it Suzy? No, not really. It is her, isn't it? Why don't you say so? Look, Fiona, I like you. Is that all? What more do you expect? I thought you loved me. You mean, you hoped I did. I love you, Lee. Doesn't that mean anything? - Where are you going? - I forgot something.
