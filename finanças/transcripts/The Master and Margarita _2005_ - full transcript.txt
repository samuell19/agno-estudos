- The articles wouldn't stop appearing. At first I was laughing. The more there were, the more serious was my attitude toward them. Then came the period of fear. The minute I turned lights out before going to bed, ...I was imagining that through the closed window ...enters some type of an octopus... ...with its long cold tentacles. I started fearing dark places. I became mentally ill. - Forgive me... - For what? For convincing you to publish a fragment. Leave everything. Go South to Black Sea resort. Spend all the money you have left. Do you hear me? - Fine, I will buy a ticket tomorrow. - I will you a ticket myself. Why so much? - I am afraid of thieves. Keep until you leave. It would be easier to die than to leave you like this. I am expected elsewhere. I am yielding to the necessity. I will be back tomorrow. I beg you, do not be afraid of anything! - You... You... - God, how could you?! lam ill. lam scared. - I will cure you, I will! You will recreate the novel. Why, 0 why did I not keep a copy? This is how one pays for the lies. I don't want to lie anymore. I would have stayed with you now, ...but I don't want my husband to remember me having ran off from him into the night. I will speak with him in the morning. I will tell him... ...that I love another man... ...and will return to stay forever. Could it be that you don't want this to happen? - Poor, poor little you. I will be having misfortunes. I don't want you to go through this with me. - Is it the only reason? - The only reason. - I am willing to die with you. I will be here in the morning. The last thing that I remember in this life, ...is the strip of light coming from the door. A curl of her hair in this light... ...her eyes full of determination. I remember the black silhouette... ...On the door step and the white parcel. Fifteen minutes after she left, ...I was arrested. - How did you find yourself here? - In the middle of January, ...I was wearing the same coat ...that by that time had no buttons... - You, crazy! Where are you going? - The driver took pity in me. To my surprise the car was headed here. I lost two toes on one foot to frostbite... ...but that was cured. - You could have let her know. She has also kept your money. Doubtless, she has kept it well. - Of course. But you do not understand. Imagine that she gets a letter from an asylum... ...one can't send letters with an address like this.. Psychiatric case... You are joking, my friend. To make her miserable... ...I could not do that. I do hope, however, that she has not forgotten me. - You could be cured, perhaps. - My case is hopeless. I do feel much better, though. It is the fourth month that I am in the hospital... ...and I find that it is not too bad... ...here. You have to keep you plans modest, neighbor. I, for instance, wanted to travel around the globe. Apparently, this isn't written in my fate. lam but a tiny part of this globe. This place is not the best part of this world. But I do repeat, ...it isn't the worst. The summer is approaching. The ivy will be curling soon. The keys have expanded my reach. The moon will be lighting up nights. She left... It is getting colder. The night is coming to an end. I have to go. - Tell me, ...what happened with Yeshua and Ponitus Pilate? I beg you, I have to know! Ah, no - I cannot think about my book without shaking. And what about your friend from the Patriarch's Ponds. He would have done it much better than I.. I thank you for the conversation. Good bye. Yeshua, I am saving you from suffering and am leaving with you. I am Matvey, your faithful and only follower! - Prohibited. Get back, I said. - Oh, God, I am late... What a fool I am... Mindless woman and coward. Dog's meat I am, not a man. God, why are you angry with him? Grant him the death. I curse you, God! You are deaf! If you weren't deaf, you would have heard me... ...and would have killed him instantly! You are not the omnipotent God! You are the dark God, I curse you! The God of robbers and the keeper of their souls! - Yeshua Ha-Notsri, do you hear me? - What do you want? Why have you come to me? - Drink. - Injustice... let me have a drink too. He is no less a criminal than I am. - Silence, cross two. - Let him have a drink... Sing glory to the mighty Hegemon. - Hegemon... - Dead. - Remove the chain! Why don't you look me in the eye when serving? Have you stolen from me? Get out of my eye! Darkness that came from the Mediterranean, ...Has covered the city so hated by the procurator. Yerushalairn has vanished, as if the great city has never existed. Yes, oh yes, the same mistake. Why have I left him that night? Why? This is madness... Yes, I came back. Like the miserable Levy Matvey - too late. Margarita Nikolayevna, what should I cook for second serving? My husband is away for three more days, while I don't care. Yesterday a magician at the theater was showing such trick that everyone was breathless. Everyone has received two vials of foreign-made perfume and stockings, all free of charge. But afterwards when the show was over, the public came out into the street and found themselves stark naked! - Natasha, aren't you ashamed? You are an intelligent and studied girl. They will say any devilish nonsense in the market, and you should not repeat such things. They are not lying, Margarita Nikolayevna! Last night the police have arrested one hundred people. Ladies were running in the Tverskaya Street dressed in underpants. - I'd like to show you a trick myself. Take this. I only ask that you not run down Tverskaya Street in your stockings... ...and stop listening to silly conversations in the grocery stores. - Thank you. NKVD!. Nearby Variety Theater staff, all gather in the office. - Yes, Sir. - Ace, go to work! Ace, sniff! Search. Ace, search! Get to work! Search, Ace! Search, Ace! Back off, Ace! - Well... Lastochkin, the accountant. What is the name of the magician? - Woland, I think. Although I am not sure. Could be Faund. Courier Karpov, were there any posters for the show? - Yes, there were. They were all posted over at night, so now there aren't any. Bookkeeper, where did the magician come from? - Who knows... You must have agreed the contract with him, then - One might assume... Well, if there was a contract, it must have passed through the accounting department. - It is a must. - Well, where is it? It isn't here. All free to go, except book keeper. Lastochkin. I have to deposit the money from last night. - The assistant will do it. - Come. - Do you know, Bassoon, ...that this building, other things noted,.. ...is famous for its pillars in the front entryway. - Let us go! - Attention, comrades, attention! Collectivism is the basis of our life. We have organized reading groups to study Lermontov, ...a group for chess and checkers, table tennis, and horseback riding. ...However, these groups have not embraced the entire tenant community... ...that differs too widely in its interests. In the summer, as agreed, we planning ...a rowing class to meet on fresh waters ...and an alpine climbing class. But even these will not embrace all of us. Allow me to introduce to you comrade Korovyev... who is a notable organizer of choral societies. - Comrades! lam telling you, I swear, that singing takes up very little time ...yet is useful by the truckload. - Be cheerful and sign up at once. - La-la-la... - Get lost! Citizen, you should not be yelling 'get lost'to your customers. Where are you going? Have you lost your mind?! - Entering without report?! - I have a little business to talk about. - I am busy. - No you aren't. - What is this? Take him away! I'll be damned! - Damned? That could be arranged... - Is the car available? - Show me the money. - Here, ...ten rubles. - No, I won't take you. - Pardon me... - Do you have three ruble bills? Have a sit. Let's go, damn it... - Why you have no change? - Full pockets. It is the third time with me just today, and others had it happen, too. Some bastard gave me a ten. I gave him 4.50 in change. The asshole gets off. Five minutes later instead of a ten I have... ...a sticker off a soda bottle. God damn it! The other on Zubovskaya. Gives me a ten. I give him 3 rubles in change. He gets off. I put my hand into the wallet and stung by a bee! While the ten ruble bill is gone. Last night at the Variety Theater some snake of magician... ...gave a show with ten ruble bills, son of a bitch! - So long. - Take it easy. Not here, there is no one here!The pants and the jacket are here, but no one on them! - Thank God! Someone brave at last. Everyone is gone!Traitors!They are all traitors, do you understand? Let us go see him, I have no idea what could be done, understand? I have no idea... What is your business? Didn't you see the writing on the door, no admission. - Do see this? Do you? He is not there! Bring him back, please. I always stopped him when he was swearing 'devil this, devil that'. Well, here is the result... Prosha, where are you? - Who are you calling Prosha? He doesn't recognize, he doesn't know me. Do you see? I would ask you to stop whaling in the office. I cannot... I cannot be looking at this. I cannot!. - Stop crying, citizen. Do you hear this? They are singing against their will? - I hear. - We sort this out... Do you see? We'll help, we'll help. Doctor, you must do something, I am begging you You must control yourself. Stop singing. Take this. Hei, Barguzin, move the wheel!. The brave fellow is near! Comrade policeman, today we have a case of mass hypnosis! - Where is my carpetbag? Relax. Get up. Comrades, follow me to the exit. Right after me, comrades, do not push each other, come toward the exit. Please, come orderly toward the exit - May I have a deposit slip. What for? - I need to deposit cash. I am from the Variety Theater - How much do you have? -21,711 rubles. - Wow! He is one of them jokers from the Variety. - I am, well... - You are under arrest. Hei, Barguzin, move the wheel!. The brave fellow is near! Let us go, come on. Take a right into the side street, best way to the psychiatric unit. - Went on tour, out of the city. - There is no head... - No head, no head! Where is the head, there is no head! Police! - Good day! May I speak with the chairman of the cooperative Mr. Bosoy? - The chairman is away... Is he is his apartment? I have an extremely urgent business with him. When will he be back? What about the secretary Mr. Prolezhnev? Same thing, the secretary is away and it is unknown when he will return... ...the secretary is ill. Is anyone available from the management? - I an. - You see, ...I am the only heir of the late Mr. Berlioz, ...my nephew has been killed, ...a you well know, at the Patriarch's Ponds. And so it is my obligation under the law ...t accept the inheritance situated in the apartment number 50. - I wouldn't know about it, comrade. Forgive me, but aren't you on the management committee? It your obligation, according to the law... Are you Mr. Pyatnashka, a member of the management committee? - I am... You are under arrest. Another complication... Did it have to happen that all three of them at once... - Good day. My name is Poplavskiy. I am the uncle of the late Mr. Berlioz. - But of course, of course! I understood that it is you the second I set my sights on you. Terrible news!. What are they doing!. - Killed by a tram... - It was cut off completely! I personally have witnessed it, with these very eyes... Believe it or not, wham! - and his head went. Crack! - and the right leg broke in half. Crack, and the left leg went. What are these trams doing?. Forgive me, you were a friend of my Misha. L can't bear it, no. I shall have to drink three hundred drops of the Valerian root extraction. I cannot take it, no, I cannot! To think how the wheels broke his leg - crack! Each wheel must weigh at least four hundred pounds! I must go lay down. I need some sleep. Excuse me, but did you send me the telegram? - He did. - Yes, I did, so what? I am asking you, so what? Give me your passport! Which police precinct you this passport? 412? Of course, I know that precinct very well. They issue passports to all kinds of rascals. I personally would never give passports to the likes of you. Never, at no cost! I would take but one look at your face and refuse you flatly. Your presence at the funeral is no longer desired. Make sure to leave to your place of residence. Azazello! - Coming... - Hello. - Poplavskiy! You got it, didn't you? You go back to Kiiv and be quiet like you don't exist. And forget about apartments in Moscow or dreaming about them, am I clear? Poplaskiy, you alive? Pardon me, comrade, let me inquire where is Apartment 50? - Further up. - infinitely grateful, comrade. What is it? - Well, since you rang, come in. Hello, yes, how? Baron Meigel? May I help you? - What filth. - ...The Artist is home today. Yes, will be happy to see you. Yes, visitors Tails tuxedo or black jacket. What? By midnight. What is it? - I must see... ...the Artist. - No kidding, the Artist himself? - Yes... - Step into the living room. - My God... The mother of all!. - Well. How can I help you? I am the manager of the food stand at the Variety Theater... - Stop right there! Not another word. Never and under no circumstances... ...will I take another bite at your establishment. I, my dearest, was passing by your stand yesterday, and am still not able to erase from memory... ...the sturgeon, nor the feta cheese. My darling! Feta should not be green. You have deceived, feta must be white! What about your tea! It is nothing but pig's wash! I saw with my own eyes that some sloppy girl was ...adding water from a bucket into your huge samovar... Fresh unboiled water! While the tea kept being served. No, my esteemed friend, that is not tolerable. - Excuse me, this is not why I am here. The sturgeon is not it, either. - How could it not be it, if it is spoiled? We got sturgeon of the 2nd degree of freshness. -2nd degree of freshness is nonsense! Freshness comes in one variety, first which also happens to the last. Whenever sturgeon is of the 2nd freshness, it is rotten. - This is not my business here. - It is not? - No. What other business might you have, then? lam glad, though. Bassoon! A stool for the Mr. Manager of the food stand. - Please. - Thank you kindly. - Not at all. Ouch, ay-ay! - You weren't hurt, were you? I like sitting low, it is less hazardous in case of a fall. Take off your pants, you can dry them by the fire. - Many thanks, but no. - Have a sit on this one. - Where were we, the sturgeon? My dear man, freshness, freshness, and freshness... ...that is what should be the food worker's slogan Would you care to try some of this? - With all due gratitude, I wouldn't... - Non-no, have some. - With all due... Try some, please do. - A goblet of wine? White, red? What region do you prefer this time of day? - Respectfully... I don't drink. - You should... Perhaps a game of dice? Or if there is another game to your liking...? Domino, or cards? - I don't gamble... - This is very unfortunate. - Why? There is something evil, if you will, about men ...that are avoiding wine, games, the company of pretty women, ...conversation over a meal... Such people are either very ill, or secretly... ...despise those around them. In any case... What business brought you here. Yesterday, you were performing tricks. - I? Why would I! It wouldn't suit me, if I may say so. - I am sorry, but the black magic show - Oh, that, yes, yes... I will tell you a secret, my friend. I am no performer. - How so? I just wanted to look at the Muscovites en masse. Theater is the best place to it and so my entourage... - Good to see you! - ...has arranged for this show. I was there watching, that is all. Don't worry, you have such a face! What is the connection of the show and you visit? - You see, among other things, the money fell from the ceiling. Everyone has grabbed it. - Everyone has, so? - A young man comes to the stand... - Yes, a young man does. - ...and gives me a ten. - A ten? - Yes. I give him change, eight and a half. - Eight and a half? - ...Then another man... - A young man as well? No, an older one.Then another and yet another. I keep giving change... Today I checked the register, ...and found paper sheets where money has been. The food stand is short 109 rubles. - Ay-ay-ay!. How could they think that the money is real? I would not allow myself the thought of their dishonesty... Could there be swindlers? Could there be swindlers among Muscovites? That is so low! You, being a poor man... You are poor, aren't you? How much savings do you have? -249,000 rubles in five savings banks... ...plus another 200 gold coins under the floor. - It isn't so much, of course, ...But should be sufficient if the lifestyle is modest. You would not need it anyway. When will you die? - That no one knows. And n one should be concerned with. - Not so unknown! This is no high science. He'll be dying in nine months, next February, from a liver cancer... ...at the 1st Moscow University Clinic, ...room 4. 240 times 9 thousand, for 9 months, comes to 27 thousand per month. Not much, but should suffice, if one exercises restraint... And then there are the coins. - No-no, the gold will not be sold: ...right after the death of Andrey Fokich the house will be demolished, ...and the gold will be taken to the State Bank. L would advise you not to bother going into the hospital, what is the point... ...to be dying in a hospital bed, among the wheezing breath and the groans of the hopelessly sick? Would it not be better to use the 27 thousand and throw a feast... ...and then to take a poison and go to the next world while listening to the music of strings, ...being surrounded by the drunk and beautiful women and the dashing friends? We have been carried away, though. - Where are your paper sheets? - One moment... Ten ruble bills...! - My dear, you truly are no well. Had too much. - That's mine. - What if they turn again? - Come see us then. Glad to meet you, come back anytime - What else you want? - I left my hat. - This isn't mine. - You came without a sword? The Variety Theater courier Karpov has testified that... ...the wanted magician lived in Apt. 50. It shall also be noted that officially Apt. 50 is occupied by... ...the director of Variety Theater, the now disappeared Likhodeyev... ...and by the chairman of Writers Union Berlioz, ...who has been killed by a streetcar under very suspicious circumstances. Today bold crime at the Writers Union is also connected with that death. Apartment 50 was checked multiple times, but the results were negative. There was nothing found in the apartment during those visits. In the meanwhile today's theft of the head tells us... ...that the gang is in Moscow and is becoming more active. In the end we have something outrageous. Thousands of people, the entire Variety Theater have seen this magician, ...as well as his damned assistants, ...while there is no way we can find him. Where has he gone, you say, fell through the ground? Did he not come to Moscow at all? - The only thread is agent Meigel. He has agreed by telephone to meet this magician. Send telegrams with the descriptions of the criminals as well as the missing... ...Likhodeyev, Rimskiy and Varenuha. Interrogate everyone again! Have the building covered. Cut the front and the back entrances into the yard. Place people on the roof behind the pipes. As to the agent Meigel, the former Baron... ...I will take care of him myself. - Arkadiy Appolonovich is not well. He has reclined and cannot come to the phone. Who is asking? Just this very second, yes, momentarily. - NKVD! - Yes, this is me. Yes, yes. - Put on your shoe! You'll catch a cold! Put on the shoe, your feet will be cold. Yes, of course. I understand. On my way. Yes. - Well, Prokhor Petrovich, ...who is Woland, and how did he use your help to get to the Variety Theater? I swear, I know no such person named Woland. The missing Mr. Likhodeyev had to send to you... ...the program for sing-off? L swear to God, no program of the show... ...and no Woland were sent to me for approval by Styopa Likhodeyev, ...while I made no calls concerning the arrival of anyone named Woland. It completely evades me, ...how Likhodeyev could allow such a performance at the Variety. - Are these your approvals? - Yes, these are... Mine. But I don't remember... My suit was without me. - Of course you remember! Where is Sempliyarov. - Come in! This is the longest and most unpleasant conversation, ...but I have to state with all frankness, ...Melitsa Andreyevna Pokobatko, the actress... - We will get to her later. ...Melitsa Andreyevna Pokobatko, the actress... - We will get to her later. Now you must tell us about the black magic show at the Variety. Being a cultured intellectual that has witnessed an ugly performance, ...I wish to describe the mysterious magician in a mask, namely Woland... ...and the duo of his assistants, whom I remember perfectly. What is your opinion, Prokhor Petrovich? - Second floor, comrades. - Room 12. Open up, Rimskiy, we know you are there. - Check it. - Yes. Here. - A-a-a! - You are under arrest. Hide me in a bullet proof camera and give me armed protection. Hide me in a bullet proof camera and give me armed protection. L wonder who are they burying with such unusual expressions on their faces? Mikhail Aleksandrovich Berlioz, the chairman of the Writers Union. Their mood is also unusual, they are carrying the dead body, ...while their thoughts are about the missing head? - What head? You see, this morning in the Griboyedov hall... ...the dead men's head was stolen from the coffin. - How could it be? - Devil knows! We should ask Begemot about it. It was stolen with terrifying artfulness. The main question is who would need the head of Berlioz. - Then the people walking... behind the coffin are writers? - Yes they are. - Do you know them by face? - All of them. Tell me, do you see the critic Latunskiy among them? Of course, where else would he be? He is in the first row off to the side, do you see him? Eyes to the sky. Margarita Nikolayevna, you hate this Latunskiy, don't you. Margarita Nikolayevna, you hate this Latunskiy, don't you. - Do you know me? I don't. - Where would I know you from? And yet I've been sent to you. - Am I being arrested? Why would you say that? I am starting a conversation, why does it have to be about arresting someone. Simply, ...I have a business with you. - What business? - I have been sent ...to invite you to visit someone tonight... ...a very important foreigner at that. Is this a new breed of pimp that has emerged, a street one? - Idiot! - Scoundrel! Darkness that has come from the Mediterranean, ...has cover the city, so hated by the Procurator. Yerushalairn has disappeared, ...as if it never existed in this world. And so should you disappear with your burned notebook and the dried rose. Keep sitting here and begging him to let go of you, give you freedom ...and let you breathe, leave your memory. You could have found out about the pages, have you bribed Natasha? You could have found out about the pages, have you bribed Natasha? But how did you know my thoughts? Who are you? What department are you with? - Oh, boredom! I am not from any department. My name is Azazello. What does my name tell you. - But you know about him? I beg you, tell me, is he alive? Don't torture me! - He is alive, yes. - God! - Please! No exclamations and unnecessary worrying. - Fine... Forgive me... - I am inviting you to visit a foreigner... ...that is completely harmless. No living soul will know about the visit, I promise. If I understood you, you are hinting that I... ...may find some information about him? - I am coming, no matter where. - How difficult are women. Why did I have to go? Begemot would have done the job, he is a charmer, ...while I am here trying to convince you for a half-hour. So are you coming? - I am. - Then take this. It will serve you well, Margarita Nikolayevna. You aged from sorrow in the past six months.. Tonight at half past ten... ...undress completely and apply ...this ointment on you face and entire body. The do as you wish, but expect a phone call! At ten sharp I will call you and give you all the details! Are you clear? 'Yes. This is pure gold, I can tell by the weight. Well... ...I realize that I am being paid off and... ...and dragged into a dirty intrigue for which I will... - There you start again... Give me the ointment! - No, wait! - Give it back! - I know what I am doing. But I am doing it for him, but I am doing it for him, ...for I have no other hope in the world. All I want you to know: ...that if I perish, you will be ashamed. Yes, ashamed. For it is love that I will perish for. 'Ha! - Some ointment! Forgive me and forget. I am leaving you forever. Don't look for me, it is futile. I am a witch now... ...I became one from the OT misfortunes and the sorrow that have plagued me. ...I became one from the OT misfortunes and the sorrow that have plagued me. I must go now. Farewell, Margarita. - How do you... How can you... How do you do this, Margarita Nikolayevna? - It is the cream! Cream! Cream! Drop it! Drop all of it! The hell with dresses! Although, take them. Take them for souvenir! Take all you can in this room! Azazello will call soon. Oh, yes, he will call! The foreigner is harmless, now I understand that. This is the neighbor from downstairs. Good evening, Nikolay Ivanovich. Are you back from the meeting? lam here all alone, listening to the waltz and looking at the moon. Nikolay Ivanovich, this isn't polite. lam a lady, after all. It is rude not to respond when spoken to. You are such a bore, Nikolay Ivanovich. lam so sick of all of you... ...that I can't even express it! Damn you, go to the mother of all devils! Azazello here. - Dear, kind Azazello. It is time, fly over. When passing over the gate, shout "Invisible" then fly over the city to get used to it... ...and then out of the city, to the river. You are expected. Farewell, Nikolay Ivanovich! Adieu, I am gone forever! I am flying away! Adieu, Natasha! - Margarita Nikolayevna... - Invisible! And free! You should be turning the bathroom lights of after use, Pelageya Ivanovna. You should be turning the bathroom lights of after use, Pelageya Ivanovna. Otherwise we will ask for your removal from the flat. You are a fruit yourself! - You are all fruits! Khusov, Dvubratksiy, Kvant, Latunskiy... Latunskiy?! Latunskiy! This is him! He has destroyed the Master! Open up! Dusya, get the door! - No need to wait. Open up! Dusya, open the door. Mother of mine! - Natasha! You used the ointment? My dear queen, the Queen of France! I have put some on his, ...bald head. This is so wonderful! I confess, I took the cream. We want to fly, to live and fly! This is so good! Wonderful, Margarita Nikolayevna. He was making me a proposal. Well? Say it again, what was the offer? How did you call me? Who am I? Who? - Goddess! I cannot fly this fast. I have important papers that I may loose. Natalia Prokofievna, I protest! What were you promising? What were you offering? How much money were you ready to pay? You won't say now that I am lying, will you? I demand to be returned to my old self. Margarita Nikolayevna, you have to reason with your homemaker! - So, now I am the homemaker?! I was a goddess just a short while ago! Faster, step on it! - I protest! lam not going to an illegal gathering! - What is it? Is that her? Clodine! You are here, 0 merry widow? - Go to the mother of hell! Who are calling Clodine. - I am sorry, please forgive my blunder. My mistake o lucent Queen Margo. The damned cognac is to blame. Put on some pants, you son of a bitch. - Welcome oh queen. Good evening - Welcome, oh lucent Queen Margo. - Welcome. - Please... Drink this... Drink, Queen. Speaks Latin Initiated, initiated - What was your transport to this river? - The broom. - Such inconvenience. Well, yes. - Send a car immediately. Please. Queen... Good bye! - My deep regards, Queen. - Greetings, Azazello. - Please. - Thank you. - Ste here, please. Come. - Allow me to introduce myself... ...Korovyev. Follow me, mistress.. Please. Now the business of the night: ...no doubt you have understood, Margarita Nikolayevna, an intelligent woman that you are, ...who is our host.. And so, each year Messier throws a ball in different cities of the world. It is called ...the Spring Midnight Ball or the Ball of One Hundred Kings. The festivity need a hostess. According to tradition, the hostess is always a Margarita. That is one. Two: she has to be a local. We found one hundred twenty one Margarita in Moscow ...and none of them are befitting the occasion. Now, in short. Would you be willing to accept this responsibility? - I would not refuse. - I thought so. Please. Oh, this? These are simply the efforts of Begemot, do not be alarmed. The ball will be spectacular, I could not hide this from you. We shall see people whose power was enormous in their time, ...but you are a royal descendant yourself. - Why royal? Queen, queens. The matters of blood are most complex. It would not be inappropriate... ...to mention a deck of cards. A hint: one queen of France, ...would be surprised beyond limit, ...if someone told her that her great-great-great-granddaughter, ...will be lead by me in Moscow through the ballrooms. We have arrived. - Greetings, Queen. I ask you to forgive my domestic outfit. Come out, the game is canceled, our guest is here. - Under no circumstances... - Please don not, Messier. Do not stop the game. I am sure that chess magazines would pay significant amounts, ...if they could print your game. - Korovyev is right. The blood is traced in peculiar ways. The blood... Since you are so disarmingly polite, which does not surprise me in the least, ...we shall proceed informally. Devil, this is so dark in here. Will this circus under the bed last much longer? Come out, curse on you, Begemot! Where is the damned horse? If you do not come out, we will take this as your loss. Damned deserter. - Never, Messier! - What is this... The hell you need a necktie for, if you have no pants on you? - Cats need no trousers, Messier. But neckties are a must in a Ball? - Allow me, ...Donna, to introduce my entourage. This foolish fellow, ...is Begemot, the cat. Hello. You have already met Azazello and Korovyev. My servant Gella, whom I recommend... ...is fast in action and in thought and will do any service she is asked for. That is all. Not much of a company. A simple mixture. It is time, Gella.. - What about me? I have a pain in my leg, and the Ball is here... - Allow me? Those close to me think this is rheumatism, ...yet I am certain that this pain in the knee... ...I got from a beautiful witch, ...I intimately knew in 1571. Nonsense, this will go away in another 300 years. You aren't tormented by anything, are you? Some sadness, perhaps? A sorrow that is poisoning your soul, hmm? - Not at all, Messier. Now that I am with you, I feel wonderful. - The blood, a real force... - It is almost midnight, Messier. - Very well. Please. I thank you in advance. Do not be scared, and do not feel lost. Drink nothing but water, otherwise it will be more difficult for you. It is time. - Come, Queen. It is fine, no problem. Nothing you can do. Oops! You have to, have to... - Patience, patience, Crystal Donna. These were made for a Chinese Princess. - Perhaps, you want to withdraw? - Of course not. I can take this. - The Ball! - Who is conducting? - Johann Strauss! Let me be hanged by the neck on a liana in a tropical garden, ...if any ball had an orchestra like this. They all are world famous celebrities. I invited them! Note that no one got ill or otherwise refused. - Greetings, King of Waltz! - Time to meet the guests, Queen.. - Here. - What happened? - Nothing... - Please. - Where are the guests? They will be here, Queen. No shortage of them. I would rather be chopping wood, ...than greeting them here on this site. L would be ready to do worse than chopping wood. I would rather check tickets on a tram, ...the worst job in the world. Allow me, Queen, to give you one last advice... The guests will differ widely, ...but no one should be treated better than all others. Anything, Queen, but lack of attention. They get sick from inattention. - Precisely. Here are the first guests! Messier Jack with his spouse. Highly recommended, Queen, an interesting man. A forger, state criminal, bastard. Yet a good alchemist. In his moment of fame he has poisoned king's mistress. No everyone can claim such an achievement. - Queen... - Queen is delighted. - I am delighted! - Count Robert, handsome as always. The opposite case, Queen, funny as it may be. He was queens lover and has poisoned his own wife. You majesty... - We are glad, Count! Oh!The charming and important Lady Tofana. She was extremely popular among the young and beautiful Neapolitan women, ...that were tired of their husbands.. It happens, doesn't it, that a husband is bothersome? Charming... We are thrilled. And so, Lady Tofana was quite understanding of these poor women... .and was selling them some water in vials. The wife would add this water into the husband's soup, ...and in the morning the beauty was free as the wind in the Spring. See the Spanish Boot on her leg? The band was used by the hot-headed jail guards, who suffocated her. I am happy, Dark Queen, I am so honored... - Delighted. We are delighted. - Oh, Frieda, she is a tiresome woman.. She wants to complain about her handkerchief. Her maid puts handkerchief on her nightstand every evening for thirty years now. She wakes up, and the handkerchief is there. She burned it, threw it in the river, ...nothing helps. - What handkerchief? - A simple one, with a blue edge. She worked in a cafn. The owner called her once into the pantry ...and nine months later she gave birth to a boy. She took him to the forest, put the handkerchief in his mouth, ...and buried him alive. In the court she said that she could not feed the baby. Delighted! - Where is the owner of the cafe?. - May I ask you, Queen? What does the owner have to do with this? It was not him killing the child. If you cut into the conversation again, you bastard... - I meant from legal position, legal! I am mute, no more sounds. Please let go of my ear! - Frieda, my name is Frieda, Queen... Get drunk tonight, Frieda, and have no thoughts. - Frieda... - Let go, she is delighted. The Queen is delighted. I bow... We are thrilled - My Queen... - I am delighted! - I am delighted! We are delighted! The Queen is delighted! Queen, a moment of your attention. Emperor Rudolf, alchemist and magician. Oh, Marquise! Poisoned her father, two brothers and two sisters over inheritance. - Goddess... - We are enchanted! Very pleasant. - Ms. Miknina, so beautiful! Some nervousness there, but who asked her to burn the maid's face with curling irons! Of course one will be slaughtered with such behavior. The Queen is thrilled. I am sorry, are you in pain? Of course not. We are delighted, delighted! - Here she is! She had such a brothel in Strasburg! Delighted! Amazing! This twenty year old fellow had strange fantasies since early childhood. Dreamer and weirdo. One young girl fell in love with him, and he has sold her into a brothel. Delighted So glad to see you. She is a tailor form Moscow, we all like her for her flight of imagination.. She had a tailor shop and has done a funny thing: she made two holes through the wall... - Did the ladies not know... - They all knew. Delighted! Good evening Baron, we are waiting for you with some news. Delighted I am so happy Oh, Guy Ceasar Caligula and Messalina. The wonderful one Just a bit more, Queen,just a little more... The Queen is thrilled. - I am thrilled! Queen, I swear these are the last moments. - You r Majesty... Oh, the party goers from Broken. They always come last. Yes, the two drunk vampires. That should be all. No-no, you must stay in the ballroom a bit more, Queen Margo.. - You must stay a little... ...so the guests do not feel abandoned. - Frieda... Frieda, my name is Frieda, Queen! - Later, dear, later... Queen... Frieda, Frieda, my name is Frieda, Queen, Frieda! - Aren't you tired? - Of course not. - Careful. Last round, Queen. And we are free to go.. Mikhail Aleksandrovich, it all happened as foretold, didn't it? The head was cut by a woman, the meeting did not take place, ...and I am staying in your apartment. This is a fact. Facts are stubborn little things. What is of interest now is what will happen next.. You were always the passionate supporter of the theory, ...that human life is gone once head is severed from the body ...and that a man turns into ashes and is gone into the emptiness. I am please to tell you in front of my guests, ...although they are proof of a very different theory, ...that your theory is solid and witty. All theories are of the same value, though. One of the theories states, ...that each will receive according to his faith. Let is be! You will go into the emptiness. While I will have the pleasure of drinking for being, ...from the goblet that you will become. Where is the Baron? He will come before you momentarily, Messier. I hear in this dead silence the sound of his lacquered shoes, ...he puts his glass on the table, ...the glass from which he drank his life's last drop of champagne. Here he comes. I am happy to present the esteemed Baron Meigel! The Baron works in the entertainment committee as a... ...as foreigner's guide to the capital's treasures. The dearest Baron was kind enough ...to call me straight upon my arrival in Moscow, ...and to offer his services in his direct capacity, ...of the treasures guide. Naturally, I was delighted to invite him for a visit. By the way, Baron... ...we have heard rumors about your extraordinary curiosity. Further more... ...the word was mentioned... ...of you being a whistle blower ...and a spy. Even more significantly... ...suggestions were made that an ending of this may be sad for you... ...in about one month. And so... ...we have decided to spare you the stressful wait... ...and help you, ...particularly since you have, ...wanted to visit with the precise purpose... ...to look and listen. - To you, ladies and gentlemen! - Drink! - Don't worry, Queen. The blood has gone into the earth, ...and grapes have grown where it was spilled. - Drink!
