A Place On The Grey Tricorne No sooner had I called forth the marble-admiral than he turned on his heel like a horse which rears at the sight of the North star and showed me, in the plane of his two-pointed cocked hat, a region where I was to spend my life. Paul Vitrac I'm so wasted. I wrote some poetry yesterday. Poetry? The letters on the sheet buck from a fever. A silly refrain turns into a shout. It's scary to die not having seen God, scary to live not having loved him. I don't remember the beginning. How do you like it? Masha! Do you hear me? When did you get home last night? I'm sick of all this, got it? Mom, are you crazy? Why are you yelling first thing in the morning? You calling me crazy? Watch your mouth! Come on, get up! And you too, please, go on, get up. Don't go there. She's like that sometimes. That wasn't even so bad. I should talk to her. Ok, go talk if you like. Mom, really, why are you yelling? I'm yelling again? I'm so sick of all this. It's like living in a brothel. What time did you come home, and don't lie to me, please. I was worried sick! Don't worry then. When you'll be a mother, we'll see if you worry. Where do you spend the whole night? And then you two come here and plop yourselves down. What are you going to talk about? You'll see what we talk about. So, what have you got to say for yourself? Good morning. What do you want from Masha? What do you mean? I'm asking you what you are doing with her. - Mom - I mean... What, what do you mean? She means nothing to you. You can see it with the naked eye Or maybe you need her in a physiological way? What's that got to do with anything? I mean she is a clean, well-behaved girl. You don't need to go looking for her. What are you talking about? Why don't you get married then? Or is she just for a time? Not really. So why aren't you in college? You don't like it? Nope. Go somewhere you like then. Where? You write well. Join a writing program. What makes you say I write well? Masha told me. What does she know? I don't know. You know what one man said? He said that life requires courage. Courage, you understand? Yes, of course. - You need to go work, study. - What for? Don't you like working? I like it. But life requires courage. So, you had your talk? Yes, I did. You mean nothing to him, remember this. John, does no one smoke where you are from? A little. I don't smoke at all. There are... 16 people in our group. Only two girls smoke. John, do they smoke marijuana? Merijuana? I never smoke that. John, how many cans of beer do you need to get drunk? When I drank a lot, 8 cans But now, four cans and I'm drunk. - Raf, where you are from? - I'm from Ghana. - Have you been to New York? - Yeah, I have. Where do you like it more, in Alma-Ata or New York? In Alma-Ata. In New York I was always tense. It's calmer in Alma-Ata. That's because you are a foreigner. Yes, a foreigner - John, do you have a wife? - No. - Why not? - I want to marry a Russian girl. They say I have to marry her and save her. - Save her from what? - From this country. I must marry her and save her. And you, don't you want to go to America? I don't care. It's bad here too. Cool, I don't care either. All right, I'm out. It was nice - See you. It's not a goodbye. - All right, see you. Let's finish this? Raf, why did he leave? We got an exam tomorrow and he doesn't know anything. - Bad student. - And you? I know everything. What do I say if I need to go the restroom? Oh, that's easy. I'm going to the restroom. What else? I'm going to take a piss - I can say that in front of girls? - I wouldn't - What do you say with girls? - I'm going to the restroom And not in front of girls? I'm going to take a leak. - Where are you going? - I'm going to take a leak. Hurry up. I used to cut the veins on my shoulder when I was a kid. I didn't know. I sat on the balcony in the winter. My blood stopped, I didn't die. You have to cut along. You open it and sit in a warm bath. No, you have to not sleep at least two days. Eat something that makes you sleep. Drink some vodka. Or some other alcohol. You'll sleep and never wake up. Yeah, you wouldn't be afraid. You know, Yukio Mishima was still sixteen when he wanted to commit harakiri. Who is Yukio Mishima? Japanese guy, if he did it when he was sixteen it would have been easy, and he knew it. He was preparing for thirty years. Became a great writer. Formed a paramilitary group with his own money. Got himself a samurai sword from the 14th century. And only then committed harakiri. What a guy. Kinda crazy. Maybe he was. We are going to take a ride. Let's go into the woods. The woods? Cool. - Let's take someone with us. - Some chicks? Of course. - It's late, who'll go? - We'll look around. Oh, I remember. Let me call. Who are you going to call? There's this girl. Let's take her, ok? - Can I use the phone? - No problem 'Hello...Dina?' What's up, dudes? Take a walk, bro. Why are you guys so grim? You have a lot of problems? What problems could you have? 'Get ready, we are going out of town.' Sitting here looking at your feet. You should look at the sky, the stars. Fuck off home. 'I coming to pick you up' Home? I don't want to go home. Who are you to send me home, anyway? What's up, man? Guys, leave him alone. What's going on? What's wrong, boys? We were playing. Now we need to finish the game. Listen, give us a knife. A big one. Are you crazy We really need it. I'll go sit down while she looks. That'll do. Let's go, bro. - He's asleep. - No way. Get up! Let's go. All right, I'll go alone. - Wait. - What do you want? You can't go anywhere. - Is the backdoor open? - Yes. You want tea? Yes. I'll put it on. But let me brew it You have to brew it right. If it's good tea, it'll come out good anyway. You don't understand anything. About tea? In general. Can I kiss you? I like kissing you like that so much. Only me or everyone? Only you. Do you like it? Yes. Why aren't you putting on the kettle? In a minute. - Do you have pastries? - No. - You have nothing sweet? - I've got sugar. Too bad you don't like sweets. I wonder what you think about me? You probably think, what an idiot. Tell me, am I an idiot? I think highly of you. When I think about you, I even feel better. I always try to think about you. You think "what an idiot" and you feel better. Are you writing anything right now? Yes. Two plays. - Two at once? - Yes. What are they called? "I don't want to be a scumbag" and "I wonder if planes are flying" Wow You know what I want... Right now? Yes. Just like that? Come on, it won't take long. What's the rush? Come on, let's do it. I don't even have curtains. You are afraid someone will see your naked butt? I'm not afraid of anything Just tell me you don't want it. I want it, but not like this. That means you don't want it. What a pity. I love you. Yeah? Don't say it again. You shouldn't say it again. - Good thing you gave me money. - You've given me so much money. - You gave it just in time. - I'll give you more. I've got enough. Why didn't you want it today? I felt bad, bad for you. Really? I feel better already. It'll be fall soon. You feel what the air is like? Yeah, sharp, kinda prickly. I feel a little more alive in the fall. Everything comes alive in this city. It's nice. People begin to move, do something. Listen to this sentence I wrote, a contamination. Having found comfort in some corner where troublemakers and heretics attack right in the stomach teaches the meaning of a confusing roll call to his old dad who has no time for the reformation of churches and the declaration of the state communist prayer regulated by the council of the world revolution. How do you like this sentence? What a strange, hypnotic spectacle. It flies and then just above the ground fills up with air like a bubble And smacks against the asphalt. It sprays everywhere. Yup, it would be nice to spit from a skyscraper too. Put on some music. Turn the music off. Can't get any quiet around here. Off, you hear me? I've had it. Go back to your hole, little mouse. You know, bro... They won't take us into the army. We've been asking for years but they won't take us. We are both psychos. We'll shoot our guys. But we don't care. Sure. I can tell that you haven't been in the army. It's too bad. You should check it out, see what's up I used to think that I wouldn't go to the army either. I could just not go. I didn't have to. I just got sick of all this - sitting, drinking, smoking wasting money, hanging around. So I decided to go. Although I didn't have to. I still can't figure out if it's better here or there. It's the same. No difference. It happens sometimes when you get sick of everything. You know, I left for the army. And those with whom I used to sit and drink like this drink from the same glass, you know, they'll go down. They have no other choice. I'll forget them and they'll forget me too Young men, I'm quite fed up with this. I've been watching you drink for a while. Now you are smoking too? Should I call the police? - No, it's not necessary. - No need, beautiful. We won't smoke anymore. We are about to leave. That's it, we are closing. Leave. Are you on the nod, by any chance? Not really, why? Your eyes look kinda weird. They are just slanted that way. Haven't noticed it before. Who are you? None of your business. I live here. You got any questions? In this room? Nah, the neighboring room. So go on to your room. You are going to tell me what to do in my house? Yup. Get out of here. Listen, why are you so mean? I was born under an ill star. Maybe you'll pour me a drink, eh? Uncle Misha, or whatever I don't see the joy in anything. So why are you drinking? Want me to read you some poetry? Sure. If eyes have grown tired of being open If they agree to be called "bro" I solemnly swear by blue eyes The flower of your life to hold - Uncle Misha. - What? Go buy some more wine. I'm not Uncle Misha. That's not important. Go, would you? I have no money. You won't get arrested? When the torpedo boat goes on a mission the commander needn't worry. Drunk? Drunk. - Aren't you ashamed of getting him drunk? - No Why don't you leave the guy alone? He came to visit the girls. He came to what? To look at the girls Go to your room. The child came to relax and then you showed up 'I could fall down.' 'Go lie down' Don't cry. Listen to me, don't cry, stop. Leave me alone. What did I do to you? You didn't do anything. You don't do anything at all. You are just sinking to the bottom and taking me with you. Listen... Go away You traumatized me. I'm traumatized for the rest of my life. 'Hey you, leave her alone' Get lost, I'll kill you. Boys Wait. Get your hands off Bastard My god. - You wait. - How horrible. What's wrong? Don't. What's he done with you? - You are going to kill him. Stop! - I'll teach you. Have you used alcohol tonight? I did, so? I wanted to go one way, and he wanted me to go the other. He didn't do anything to me. Please let us go. Ok. You may go. Go. So tell us. Tell you what? Tell everything. Lieutenant, what's your last name? Why do you need to know my last name? - I just want to know. - What else do you want? Ok, and what is yours, sir? And what's that for? - You grabbed my hair. - All right, cut it out, you. Not "you", but "sir". Sergei, take him out of here. All right, bye. Say "Hi" to everyone Have fun without me. What's up, bitch? Don't, honey. It's my fault. I'm sorry. - Forgive me. - Go away. Forgive me. My little snake. I love you. I love you. Forgive me. My little doggie I'm sorry. Were you telling the truth last night? No, I was afraid of you. That's what I thought. All right, go, nothing to be done about it. I don't understand. Why do we live? What's the point? I see these letters burning in front of me all the time "WHY" Why do we bother? Run around? Why do we worry? Have you read "The Gay Science" by Nietzsche? - No. - You should. You know what he says? That life has its own worth. Your existence is a bonus. That's happiness. You must get pleasure from life itself, not from what we live for. I don't know. But I do. He writes that we are all volcanoes awaiting the hour of their eruption When it will happen no one knows, of course. Even God himself. What if life doesn't bring pleasure. Then I don't know. No one can help you there. It's me. I'm sitting here waiting for you. Sorry, I probably ruined your tape. I just came to visit. Oh well, I thought that was you. You are not here. Let me sing you a song, ok? I forgot the barbed dawn I will forget the hungry morning I will believe your eyes aren't there And that it will all end at night. I wrote it for you. When you weren't around. Can I read you some poetry? Remember I told you that I write poetry Ok, I'm going to read, listen. In that house where it's so dark and stuffy That even the stars dry out and fall through the window Though we don't hear the music of the ringing cicada choir In that house the young sit around the table Let's see, how does it go... In the fog of a hangover float the mouths of smiles The scattered glances of priceless emptiness And the rhythmic ringing of glasses Shining eyes and laughter A spiritual weariness Of merciless delights Nice, right? Ok, I'm going home. Kisses. - You know, something's happened to me. - What? I don't feel good. You want some wine? Do you have anything? Yeah. Just explain what's what. I like to mix. Me too, let's go. Half of this one, this one, this one. And one each of these. We can drink some more wine. It'll feel even better. Just can't have too much. I know. You can OD. What's up? You know, I like you so much. I try to think about you all the time. Let's hang out tomorrow, drink something. I'll call you around 11. All right, bye. I think I love you. Do you love me too? Isn't it great. I'm not laughing, I'm happy. Let's get married. Tomorrow? Ok, tomorrow. I'll call around 11. Ok, bye. I'm not feeling it anymore. It's me. That's not important. What's important is that I'm calling. You know, I forgot to say goodbye. I don't have anyone else to say goodbye to. Yeah, I'm sorta leaving. Leaving in a way. With me? Nothing, I'm fine. Nah, it's fine. Ok, honey, stay safe. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sick of it too. Are you ok? Get up. What's wrong? Get up. Are you crazy? - What's the time now? - Eleven Dumbass... I'll come over, leaving now. Ok, I'll definitely be there. Right away. My voice? I just don't feel so good. I'm still coming. Bye. Dumbasses. Gotta go. - To see the idiots? - No. I just have some business. How are you? Fine, except my head is a little fucked up. It won't pass. - You are tough. - Yeah, tough. What's this? - Galaxies. - What are they called? Top right is the Horsehead Nebula - This one? - Yes. Give me matches. What are we watching? A movie.
