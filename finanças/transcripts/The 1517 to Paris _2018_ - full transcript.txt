My name is Anthony Sadler. You're probably wondering why a brother like me is hanging out with these two crackers. But trust me, they're my two closest friends. Let me introduce you. This is Alek Skarlatos, the robot. He's a strong guy. He'll always have your back whenever you're in trouble. And this is Spencer Stone. You don't have to worry about him having your back in trouble because I'm sure he'll find it first. Seems like the three of us have been getting each other in trouble ever since middle school. But let me take you back and show you how it all began... Oh. Hi. Ms Eskel? Yeah, hi. I'm Spencer Stone's mother. This is Heidi, Alek Skarlatos' mum. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't think we were meeting until 3:15. Yes. Well, we had some similar concerns. So... Thought we'd join forces. Well, I... We're concerned, I guess, with the boys starting junior high. - Rightfully so. - Yeah. We've noticed some bullying with the classmates, and we were worried it might be affecting their school work. Ms Eskel. Ms Skarlatos. May I be quite frank? Spencer is behind on his reading. Very behind. And Alek is too easily distracted. Has anyone ever discussed ADD with you two? In my opinion, both Spencer and Alek suffer from something called Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD. Do you think that you might be jumping to this conclusion too quickly? It's not a quick jump, Ms Eskel. As I previously mentioned, Spencer cannot concentrate on his reading. Well, that might be my fault. Now that I know he's falling behind, I can... And Alek spends most of his day staring out the window. I'm sorry. Did you say that Alek "looks out the window"? Yes. Just so I'm clear, do the other kids not look out the window? There are things you can do to help them focus. There are myriad medications out there that will significantly... Medications? - Joyce, it's okay. - No, it's not okay. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to pinpoint you. So, you're telling me that I need to drug my child to make your job easier. These medications will help them focus, and it would be easier for the boys... If you don't medicate them now, they'll just self-medicate later. Do you think this is a good solution? Throwing pills at a problem? Then let's go. You know, boys of single mums, it's just statistics. But statistically, they are more likely to develop problems. My God is bigger than your statistics, so I don't really care what you have to say any more. I am happy to say that we will not have to have another lice check tomorrow. And the results are in for our class election. Our new school president is... This is it, campaign manager. The moment of truth. - Marie Hodge. - Yes. Congratulations to everybody who ran, and congrats to our new school president. Hey, maybe it was a mistake. It's cool. Way to go, loser. Come on, Spencer, you're not always going to win. It just doesn't work that way. You don't get it. No one gets it. I tried to fit in here. I tried. They wouldn't let me. You fit in with me. I get you. My mum thought it'd be better switching me to a Christian school. Instead, it's like church, class, same people everywhere. All the time. I just hate it. Boys, the bell rang, you should be in class. A grunt of acknowledgement would be helpful. All right, you're late for class. Where's your hall pass? Hall pass. Here's my hall pass. Let's go. Principal's office. Let's go. Move it. And like I said, sir, it'll never happen again. Tell that wife of yours I said hello. What are you guys in for? Expired hall pass. Amateurs. Up. Get up. Hey, word of advice? Stay away from that kid. He is a charmer but he will get you into trouble in a heartbeat. Of course if you're here, you are already in trouble. Ah. Why are we dressed like the A-Team? All right, let's go. Good morning. Ooh, that's loud. Bring it in, come on. All right, if you haven't already guessed, today's activity is basketball. Hopefully, you've heard of it. I'm gonna divide you guys up into two teams today. Okay? You listening? Two teams. All right, if your last name begins with A through M, you're gonna be team one. You're gonna be over there. If it begins with N through Z, you're here. All right? If you have any questions, don't ask me. I promise I'm not gonna have the answer. All right, go. Come on, guys. Over here. Yeah, let's go. Right here. Hey, isn't that the kid from the principal's office? Yeah. Yeah, that's him. Hey, what's up? I'm Stone. First name Spencer. I'm Skarlatos. First name Alek. You always introduce yourselves like that? No. Just wanted to show you we we're on the same team. We're the kids from Principal Akers' office. Oh, that's right. Sorry, I spend a lot of time there. Did you ever get that new hall pass? Well, I'm Sadler. First name Anthony. And if you ever do need a hall pass, I can hook you up. - Cool. - Oh. Oops. What the hell? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, man. You know that kind of language isn't allowed in here. What are you doing? You're on a warning, all right? Are you shitting me? Okay. All right, walk. You're going to the principal's office. Now. Walk. Sadler out. You guys think that's funny? You guys wanna walk, too? Yeah, why not? Why not? What a fun day. Hey, who else? Who else wants to go? Please, I'm in a mood. I can do this all day. All right, let's go. Oh. Are you guys for real? I had no idea you guys could be that cool. What? We're cool. - Yeah. We're so cool. - Huh. I think your appearance might imply otherwise. Now, hold on. Camo's cool. Wait. Isn't camo cool? In a word? No. Sadler. My office. Right now. Don't roll your eyes at me. Didn't I warn you two about this guy? Move, move, move, move. Double time. Double time. Move, move, move your feet. Now, you said what? This is a Christian school. Anthony. Stone, my boy. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, wow. That's fun. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms Eskel. You too. Aren't you sweet? You guys have fun. Anthony, come on. I wanna show you my room. Alek and I are gonna play Airsoft outside. You wanna pick a gun? - Whoa. - M16. AK. Jeez. This here's the paintball gun. A couple pistols. Nice. Now, if you think that's cool, this is the big gun. Whoa. It's for hunting. You ever seen a real gun? No. Not a for real one. You've never been hunting? No. I mean, black people don't really hunt. It's not like a thing we do in our leisure time. Come on, let's go find Alek and play war. You know what? I've got an even better idea for war. Okay. Hello? Hi, Alice, how... Oh, well, it was probably just some neighbourhood kids. Do you want me to send Spencer over to help you... You've got to be kidding me. Jeez, Mum, have you heard of knocking? This is my house. I don't need your permission to enter. Okay, I'm sorry. I just hung up the phone with Alice, and she told me that a skinny black kid and a pasty white kid just decorated her house with toilet paper. I'm sorry. I didn't think she could see us. So that makes it okay? You can do what you want as long as you don't get caught? No, Mum. I didn't mean it that way. I am mortified, Spencer. Mortified. What am I gonna tell Anthony's father? I don't think you should tell... No, you don't think. The constant calls from the principal, all the trouble you've been causing, it's too much. It's too much, Spencer. Mum, I'm sorry. And it is getting harder and harder to come in here, because every time I do, I just leave disappointed. - Mum... - Go to bed. Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is darkness, light. And where there is sadness, joy. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born into eternal life. Amen. Spencer, go. FDR. A man who did the right things at the right times to defuse dangerous situations at extremely critical moments. So if something were to happen right now... Would you know what to do? Would you know how to act? Would you act? All right. Don't forget. Test tomorrow. And read the book. Do not say I didn't warn you. I'm talking to you, you and especially you. Thanks, teach. - Glad you boys enjoyed. - We always do. Were you ever able to find any battle plans from World War II? Ah, you know what? Printed these out last night. That should hold you over until tomorrow. Oh, my gosh. Dude, check that out. - Oh, yeah. - This is awesome. - Thank you so much. - Dude, thank you. Those boys. Attack. Attack. Attack. Oh, crap. There's something about war, man. The brotherhood, the history. In the trenches helping out. Like your grandpa, I guess. I wanna go to the prom. You mean, like, with us? No, man. I mean, just in general. We don't have it at our school. There's no prom here, or homecoming. I don't know. No public school stuff. Exactly. So, are you gonna leave? Yeah. I mean, you guys are great, but I need a girlfriend. Well, we'll miss you, man. Hey, I'll keep in touch. I mean, someone's got to let you guys know what it's like to have a girlfriend. Hey. Maybe Anthony's right. We should leave, too. It sucks without him. We don't have a choice. We were lucky to leave our last school. Look, it sucks. But if we keep our heads down, we'll be fine. You've got to be kidding me. We got to go, we're gonna be late. We can't just spend our lives in fear. Guys, class. Now. Class is right there. We're on time. We're talking back today? But you're not in class, are you, huh? And I suppose either of you don't have hall passes. The two of you need an escort? Move. Move. No, they're not problem children. I don't understand where this is coming from. Did anyone get hurt? No. No, Ms Eskel, no one has gotten hurt. Yet. But I wouldn't put it past them. Is this a joke? You think our boys would hurt someone? Ms Skarlatos, we know this is difficult, but we think it would be in your son's best interests if he stayed with his father. How dare you. After all I do for this school. Coaching and volunteering. You have no business. No business. We have consulted with the Lord. You have no right. No right butting in our lives. The absurdity of it all. Jesus. Come on, sweetie. Come on. Come on, Spencer. - Okay. - Wait. This isn't goodbye. Just a see you later. It's okay. Ready? Let's go. Spencer. I know this is gonna be hard on you, but it's a really short flight to Oregon, and you can go visit him whenever you want. I promise. Okay? Okay. Okay. What do you keep looking at? That guy's been in there for, like, 10 minutes. Ten minutes. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I saw him go in there with a suitcase. A suitcase? I don't know what he's doing. Maybe he's changing his clothes. Maybe so. I'm gonna go check it out. - All right? - Okay. Man, that guy's been in there for a while. Yeah, I noticed. Get out of here, it's serious. I've got the gun. So data analysis is really where it all begins. It's the basis for any job you might have. Even if you wanted to work in, say, middle management at Nike, you'd have to have some semblance of knowledge of numbers in order to gauge sales. Mr Skarlatos. What about you? What kind of work are you interested in? I've always wanted to join the military. Okay, now, see, even as it pertains to the military, you'll need numbers. Statistics, analysis, troop movements, supply chain logistics. Any kind of real-world job that any of you might wanna have is going to include numbers. You're gonna need... Hey, Stone, who are we throwing daggers at? Not throwing daggers. Just thinking. Don't hurt yourself. Hey, that recruitment centre over there, what's all that about? It's where people go and sign up for the service. What part of the service? All of them. I think. I don't think they discriminate. Hey, sir. How are you doing? Welcome to Jamba Juice. What can I get for ya? You know, can I just get a smoothie with strawberry and banana, please? Nothing else. - Yeah, no problem. One second. - Thanks. So if you don't mind me asking, what part of the service are you with? Oh, this here is a Marine's uniform. Oh, yeah, right. Just double-checking. So, if you could do it all over again, which would you choose? - Which what? - Which branch? I mean, would you still go with the Marines? Or was there something else? Oh, I can't say I ever thought about that before. So, you'd still go with the Marines, then? Well, that's hard to say, too. I love what I do, but I always wanted to be part of the Air Force Pararescue. And their sole purpose is saving people's lives. Pretty badass. Yeah. Yeah, that is badass. Can you imagine putting your hands on a man in his most frightening moment? And drawing him back to life? Yeah. Yeah, I can. Well, here you go. Thanks. How much? On the house. Thanks for your service. Happy to do it. Thank you. Appreciate that. You have a good rest of your day. You too. Wow. With that tip he left you, you're just about able to cover the smoothie you now get to pay for. Totally worth it. They're analysing statistics of populations, they're analysing intelligence scores. There's all kinds of applications for data analysis. This is a big first down. They need this right here. I know. They better give it to Marshawn, man. He's like their best player. He's been having a monster game, too. I know. He's a beast, man. Chambers was saying we play a lot of players. - Come on, baby. - There you go. Break that. There you go. Keep going, keep going. - There you go. - Oh. Run. - Boom. There you go, baby. - And he ran them over. That was a good play. And he's got a first down for California. - At the 31. - Wow. Only a full day later. What happened? Alek, man. I texted him some big news, like, eight hours ago, and he's just getting back to me with this lukewarm response. What was the big news? Oh, I'm gonna try out for the Air Force Pararescue. Oh. Man, that's... That's great. For real? You're gonna join the Air Force now, huh? Okay. So what's that about? What's what about? How come no one's hearing this as life-changing information? I don't know, man. Maybe... Maybe because it's you. What does that even mean? I mean, not to say anything against you or anything, but you kind of got to be in shape to be in the military, you know? Come on. So I got to lose some weight. So what? I mean, it's not just that. What about your motivation? You quit football to play basketball. Then you quit basketball because you weren't getting enough playing time. Okay. So you don't think I can do it, then? Spencer, man, no one thinks you can't do it. We just don't think you will. Okay. Guess we'll see about that. Forsett was a yard short of 1,000 yards... Once you begin to discover who you are, then you really realise how you have been given authority over your life. But you can only do that through the struggle of life. And most people avoid the struggle. Most people go through life avoiding pain. When you're working on a dream, at some point in time a transition takes place. Something in you that you never activated lies dormant in there. You learn how to leap higher. You start challenging yourself to dig deeper. You don't need anybody to approve your dream. Do what you know is right. Don't try and take any shortcuts. Pay your dues. We've been chosen for this great work. Let's go. Is that all you got? Let's go. Nine minutes, 14 seconds. Damn, Stone... I didn't know a big guy like you could run that fast. Thank you, sir. Ninety-six. You did it. You passed. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Whoo. All right, that's very good. All right, now, just step over here. Okay. Head against the bar. And which circle is different? Let me see. Is this a trick question? Number three is different. Stone. Here is a list of speciality codes that you have qualified for. Please review the list and choose your top three. - Turner? - Sir. Hey, sir, sorry. The, the job I wanted is not on here. I don't see Pararescue. Looks like you didn't qualify. What do you mean, I didn't qualify? I passed the stamina test, I got a good ASVAB score. The doctors didn't say anything was wrong with me. Looks like you were disqualified for lack of depth perception. What? You don't have depth perception. You can't be a PJ without it. Are you serious? Choose three jobs from the list in order of preference. Pick quickly or you might not get anything. We're only open for another 30 minutes. Turner. Here's a list of jobs that you have qualified for. Please review the list and choose your top three. A year I punish myself and for what? Because of depth perception? You got to be kidding me. Okay. Is there something that you can do? Someone we can appeal to? Maybe we can write a letter. No. It's not something you can appeal. Okay, okay. Honey, here, sit down. Honey, it's gonna be okay. It'll be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. That's the thing. Why did I even work so hard in the first place? Baby, listen, it's you, okay? When you were a kid, if you heard the word "war" on the television, you would practically jump inside the TV screen to get involved. Exactly. I just wanted to help. I don't get why they won't just let me go do it. You know, I haven't really accomplished much with my life. At least before I could say it's because I hadn't really tried. Now I can't even say that. I tried and I failed. This is worse. To McLemoure. Wow. He still finishes. Saw that one coming. That's the second alley-oop he's converted on. Hey, what's going on, man? - What's up, man? - Glad you made it. - How you doing? - Good. Just watching the game. Come on in. Man, I hope San Jose State upsets Kansas, too. We need this. Oh, yep, yep, yep. Saw this guy dunk on this fool earlier. Reminded me when I dunked on your ass. Ah, you ain't never dunked on me. You want a beer? Actually, yeah. I had to come see you before you dipped out of here, you know. You must be nervous, right? Ah, it's all good. I'm just going to Texas for basic. Yeah, but not a lot of people make it this far in the process, you know. That's a commitment. - Cheers. - Cheers. So you're about to get up out of here, man. You excited or what? Yeah, but... I don't know, man. Remember when I brought this up a long time ago? How could I forget? You were about 30 pounds heavier and nobody thought you would get here. Yeah, man. Well, it ended up being that you were right. Right about what? Well, I went to MEPS and I got disqualified for depth perception, so I can't even go be a PJ. You know, I don't really know, like, the ins and outs of the military stuff. What do you mean? Basically, I had to end up signing up for SERE instead. What's that? It stands for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape. It's not really the same thing at all. Well, I mean, even if it's not the same thing, I'm sure it'll still be meaningful, you know. Yeah. But I'm just not passionate about it, you know? I just wanted to go to war and I wanted to save lives. Well, I'm sure whatever job they put you in, you'll still be able to help others. It's who you've always been. Yeah, yeah, I guess so, man. - What's going on? - Hey, man, what's happening? What the hell is that? A sewing project? Yeah. Great. So I guess we have that to look forward to. What function does that even serve? Survival. If you eject from an aircraft, all you'll have is a parachute, few other tools, you know, anything else you can scrounge up to make a hammock, tent, trip wires, weapons to hunt with. Cool. So I guess home EC will help us survive. - Yeah, I guess so. - Pretty much. Spencer, man, take a break. I can't, man. I'm already pretty behind on all my assignments. I'm about to fail out. Well, here, look. Let me show you something. Check this out. - Ta-da. - What is that? It's for sewing. So you can pound needles through without your hands going raw. Okay. All right. I see what you're doing. Now your hands will stay baby soft. Dude, this is literally the only way I'm gonna even finish in time. Oh, don't worry, with baby soft hands, you'll always finish fast. You guys are something else, man. Left face. In line. - Who are we? - Air Force. Oh, shit.

Drop. On the podium. Airman Stone, why are you doing push-ups? I'm late, Sergeant. Yes, you were late. Why are you late? I overslept, Sergeant. He overslept. Ladies and gentlemen, let this be an example to you of what not to do. SERE. SERE. 1401. Recover. Carry on. SERE. Well done. Airman Stone, do you look like everyone else? No, Sergeant. No, you do not. Drop. Airman Stone, you're doing push-ups because you cannot follow simple directions. SERE. SERE. 1401. Recover. - Carry on. - SERE. Airman Stone, your stitches are not tight enough. I'll do them over again, Sergeant. Airman Stone, I have no choice. This is not a game. This is survival. There are no do-overs. Do you understand me? Yes, Sergeant. Report to the MTLs and you'll be served your elimination papers. Okay. Here we go. All right. I knew you shouldn't have driven all the way here just to say goodbye. Well, I was worried about you, Alek. I've had this profound sense of fear about you going to war. Well, you're a mum. You're supposed to worry about your kids. But listen, sweetie. I prayed about it. And God spoke to me and He told me that something very exciting is going to happen. And... I can't wait to see what He has in store for you. I'm gonna be fine. Love you, Mum. What's going on? Somebody please. What's happening? There's a guy with a gun. Just run. Come on, Dad, we got to go. No, you go, my darling. You go. I'll follow. I'll follow. Oh, cool. We're gonna be glorified cattle. That's what we get for not cutting it at Lackland. Daycare for adults. What does that mean? Just what I heard. Instead of teaching fighting they teach you how to "mitigate the room vulnerabilities" by, like, running and hiding. Thought we were in the military? That's hard. ♪ They've come to get the wounded ♪ ♪ They've come to get the wounded ♪ ♪ They've come to get the dead ♪ ♪ They've come to get the dead ♪ All right, so once you've inflated the bladder to the desired pressure, in this case, 140 mm Hg or higher, you're gonna listen to make sure you cannot hear the pulse below the bladder. That's critical. Are there any questions on this section? No? Okay, let's move on. Let's go to the next chapter. There is an active shooter on base. Shelter in place until you receive further instructions. This is not a drill. Okay, there is an active shooter on base. You guys, move this desk over to the door. Make sure it can't open. Everybody else, get under your desks. This is not a drill. Move. This is not an exercise. Get under your desks now. Okay, remember the protocol. If you escape, you do not engage. Protect yourselves. - All right. - We're so screwed. It's all I got, man. Stone. Stone, get under your desk, now. God damn it. Stone. What the hell are you doing? None of you move. Francis, get back under your desk. Stone, what the hell are you doing? Get under your desk. We're clear. Okay, that's the all-clear. Stone, you wanna move this desk back for me? Somebody help him, please. God damn it. Guys, this was a false alarm. Just wanted to let you know that everything is completely fine, - and that we're all safe. - What happened? An active shooter alert went out over our PA system, but the actual location wasn't attached. It was nearby, but not our base. Carry on. Everybody settle. Jesus Christ... Stone, what the hell were you going to do with a ball point pen anyway, huh? I don't know, madam. I just didn't want my family to find out that I'd died hiding underneath a desk. Huh. Show of hands. Who thinks Stone's an asshole? Come on, man. Yeah, me too. That's gonna be on the test. Strange. No beggars on our tail. Guess they're not following today. Check the DAGR and confirm our coordinates. Roger. Skarlatos, come on, man. Shit. I can't find my rucksack. Did you have it at the last stop? Yeah. Security halt. Better be back there. We have a security halt. Cover. Shit. It's not here. I had two mags of 50 cal and the DAGR in it. Everybody mount up. We're going back to the village. I guess we figured out why the villagers didn't follow us. Congratulations, Airman Stone, you just gave this man permanent brain damage. But I thought I needed to get an airway in. He needs to breathe, right? You do. But did you notice that our friend here has clear fluid in his ears? What might that clear fluid be, Mr Stone? Oh, shit. Not quite. Guess again. Spinal fluid, madam. Correct. Spinal fluid. And if your friend has spinal fluid in his ears, what does that tell us? He could have damage to his skull. Okay. So, to recap. You just walked up to a guy who was already having a pretty bad day to begin with and you shove a piece of silicone into his brain. You just lobotomised him. Well, I figured I'd get that in first so he could breathe and then I'd move on to his other stuff. Okay, but sometimes you need to deal with the bleeding first. So, I'd put a tourniquet on it, then? Not always. What if the wound was on the neck, say? A tourniquet on the neck is better known as a noose. What do I do, then? In that case, you say a prayer. And you hope something creative occurs to you. That's some sound advice. Let's make this quick. - Put out security. - Roger that. Skarlatos, stay here. Don't move. Don't move. Let's go. - What'd they want? - A knife. Some shell casings. Our shiny trash. Yeah, it's all here except... Except what? My hat. With my name on it. Well, looks like some unfortunate soul just got the nickname Skarlatos. Let's go. Mount up. - Mount up. - Mount up. Let's move. We in? Hit it. Lock those hands up. Get in there, Spence. Spence, go for the legs. Okay, now when you have someone in a hold like this, use your free hand to clamp down on the carotid artery. There you go. Spence, get it in. You think your opponent's just gonna let you do that to him, huh? Spence, you don't got it. Line his chin up with the elbow. I'm trying. Spence, get your hooks in, go for the legs. Not just the arms. Go for the legs. Don't give him any clues. Spence, get your hooks in. Come on, man. - Deeper. - Spence, lock it up. All right, you got him now. Whoo. Alek, what up? Spencer, hey, what's up? I'm fine. Getting good at this. Good at what? Like, checking rashes? No, I've been doing jiu-jitsu. I'm starting to finally figure this shit out. Not getting my ass beat every match, at least. Well, that's good. There's, like, nothing to do over here. But you're in Afghanistan. Yeah, well, nobody cares about Afghanistan any more. Now the real bad guys are ISIS. Not many of those over there? No, I'm like a security guard. Basically just a mall cop. Well, adventure starts soon. Did Strasser ever decide if he's coming with us on the Great European Tour? Yeah, no, he can't go. I'm thinking about asking Solon, but I don't think he's going to have enough money. Okay. Well, just let me know, man. I'm getting excited. Yeah, you have no idea. I'm desperate to get out of here. I still think we need to park it in Germany for a while, though. Yeah, it's just that, there's so much I wanna see, you know? And chances are this will probably be one of the last times I'll get to do something like this. Look, I know you have that girl there. What was she? An exchange student? Yeah, in Oregon. We just keep in touch. And she invited you to stay with her in Germany? Yeah, but it's not just that. I just kind of wanna soak it in a little bit. I don't wanna be moving around every day. I mean, we don't get to go on leave that often. Yeah, well, if you just wanna stay in Germany, man, that's cool. Just do that. Yeah, well, I mean, my family history is there. And they're the reason I wanted to join the military in the first place. Well, we don't have to decide right now. Hey, whatever happened to that sniper training? I'll tell you about that later. Basically, I'm just really bored. That sucks. I'm over here having a freaking blast. Drinking beers, hanging on the beach, doing jiu-jitsu. Portugal is paradise. You're a piece of shit. What's that? You must be breaking up. Sounded like you called me a piece of shit. All right, well, it's like midnight here. I got to go to bed. All right, hang in there, brother. Later. All right. Stone. First name Spencer. What's up, my guy? Chilling, man. What are you doing? You know, just the morning routine. Chilling. Any action over there yet? Nah, this is a pretty cake assignment. But, listen, I got an idea for you. Me and Alek were just talking about doing a backpacking trip all over Europe. You should, man. You could be posted anywhere after this one, right? Yeah, but I'm trying to say you should come with us. Wait, wait. You mean, meet you in Europe? Yeah, son. It'll be crazy. You have the summer off, don't you? Man, come on, you know I don't got money like that. Just take out a credit card. You'll pay it back. Ah, I see them headphones. You must be working for a credit card company now, huh? Just see what you qualify for. That's crazy you say that though. I was just talking to my co-worker about getting a credit card with frequent flyer miles, too. Anthony, it's meant to be, dawg. Come on. All right, man, screw it. I'm in. Hey. What's up, man. You made it. What's up, bro? Hold on, let me grab my bag real quick. All right. Come on, let's go check in. Isn't this crazy? We made it to Europe, though. I know, man. Look around. Hold on, hold on. We got to get a shot of this real quick. There it is. Come on, man. I've been waiting out here forever. All right, all right. - Hey, how you doing? - Hello. Welcome to Roma. - Thanks. - Last name? - Stone. - Stone. Perfect. Well, I have your room for two. Would you like two keys, then? - Yes, please. - Okay. And is this your first time staying with us? It's actually our first time in Italy. Oh, welcome. Well, in that case, if you don't have any plans for tonight, we have a party bus leaving from our bar. And they call it the Perversion Excursion, if that translates. Oh, yeah, I think it translates. Would you like me to sign you up? Yes, please. I think we're gonna have a good time in Italy. Yeah, I think so. Well, I hope you're seeing all the sights before your excursion. Oh, yeah. We plan on seeing all the sights. We made it to the Coliseum, baby. It's crazy that they built this back then. Can you believe how big it is? And can you believe people used to kill each other in there? Because imagine watching that now, somebody fight a lion. Are you not entertained? Do you give him a thumbs up or a thumbs down? Thumbs down. Kill him. Lot of old shit here. That's for sure. You trying to throw some coins in or something? Just throw it backwards. - Throw it backwards? - Yeah, if you want to. Did it make it? I don't know. We'll see if we ever come back. Let's go down there, yeah. Then we'll know we made it. And again, one, two, three. Oh, yeah, that's good. What you think? Hold on, what you think? Oh, yeah, you got the shot. You got it, you got it. We got to post that for sure. This is it, baby. The Trevi Fountain. Don't fall over. Let's take a selfie or something real quick. You know, we got to capture this moment. You feel me? Race you up the stairs. Ah, you slow. That must be where the pope lives, you know? I don't even know. Is that the Vatican? What is that? If you're standing right here, you're directly in the centre of all these columns. Hold on, I got to take a picture of that. That's crazy. Wow. Trying to head back? Yeah. Let's go back to the hostel. It was a good day. Yeah, let's get ready for that excursion. Lea. Alek? Hi. - Hey, what's up? - Jump in. - So good to see you. - Hi. Welcome to Germany. Thank you. Let's go. Yo, this shit is unreal. I'm saying. It's why they call it backpacking, bro. Can we just please get to the hostel, man, before I throw this damn bag in the canal? Or I throw your ass in first. Hey, you're the one who almost cost us the trip on the first night. Yeah, now I'm the guy travelling in Europe on a broken ankle. Whatever, man. We need to catch one of these taxis or whatever. These boats or something. Is this where we get on, right here? Yeah, I think so. Are you sure? Do you even know? I don't even know, man. Let's just go figure it out. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Did you see those pretzels? Oh, my God. They look so good. Yeah. So is it everything you dreamt? Oh, yeah, absolutely. This is amazing. Do you know which table was his? Ah, I'm not sure if he had a table per se, but if I know my Grandpa Nick... - Yeah. - Probably would have - sat right there. Yeah. - Okay. - Shall we? - Yeah. It's nice. Yeah. What did you get us? - Two beers. - Oh, awesome. Great. Okay. So, you're not going to tell me the story? Ah, well, it's not really much of a story. Silly. My father says everyone has a story and it's our duty to tell it. Well, all I know for sure is that about sixty-two years ago, my grandpa sat right here. - Thank you. - Thank you. My grandpa sat right here and celebrated getting his stripes. - Becoming a sergeant? - Yeah. In the German forces? No. No. American. He... He was raised in New York, and he was stationed here during World War II. Okay, so, here you are. Following in his footsteps. Yeah. I guess so, in a way. I'm so happy that you're here. - Cheers. - Cheers. Wow, look at that view. Man, I haven't been able to get a good picture this entire time we've been here. Bro, just use my selfie stick. You'll get all the background in it too. Why don't you just take a picture of me? Hell no. I'm tired from this heat, and those eight thousand miles you made us walk today. Well, bro, I'm not about to use a selfie stick, and stick out even more than we already are. Right. Because that'll make us stick out any more. Hey, excuse me. Do you speak English? Yeah, I do. Do you think you could take a picture of me? Don't ask. He's grumpy right now. - He doesn't wanna do it. - Okay. Yeah. Sure. Cool. Thank you. Okay. One, two, three. Oh. It's kind of dark. You wanna check it? I'm sure you got it. Let me see. Yeah, that looks good. Thank you. - I appreciate it. - Yeah, of course. I'm Spencer. - Lisa. - Nice to meet you, Lisa. - Nice to meet you. - This is Anthony. He tragically can't stand up right now. - How you doing? - Nice to meet you. So what are you up to? First day in the city. Just taking a trip around. Nice. Us too. We're going over to the San Marco Square. - You wanna go with us? - Yeah. Sure. Yeah. All right, come on. Take a seat. Okay. Thanks. - So where are you from? - LA. Oh, nice. Yeah, - we're from Sacramento. - Oh, nice. Three California kids in Italy? What are the chances? Seriously. - Small world. - Yeah, I know. Guys, say what you want, but we can't waste this opportunity. - Look, we got to take a selfie. - It is pretty stunning. - It is, yeah. - All right. Let's all get in it. Ah. - Let's check it out. - That's pretty good. I got to give it to you, man. The selfie stick is where it's at. I told you. See. Look. That's Instagram-worthy. We got to get some gelato. Ah, this looks amazing. Buongiorno. Oh, I love a good mint chip. Oh, my gosh. I need this right now. Can I try the wild fruit, please? - Wild fruit? - Yeah. What are you getting? Can I get the mint chocolate chip, please? Mint chocolate for you? - Yes, please. - That looks good, too. Which one are you gonna get? Think I might get the hazelnut right there. Grazie. And then can I get the hazelnut? And hazelnut for you. My treat, guys. My treat. It's amazing, guys. Oh, my God. It's good? Has to be good. It's the best in town. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you. Ooh, this place is so dark. Oh, and I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to take photos in here, Anthony. Yeah, now you can finally put that stick away. Whoa, guys. Hold your horses. Wow. Really, bro? I thought it was pretty funny. Man, you don't see stuff like this back home. That's for sure. This would actually look cool in front of the capitol, though. So, you guys wanna go get some food now? Yeah, I'm starving. Are you as hungry as a horse maybe? - Ooh. - Looks good. So what do you think of our plans so far? You think we're gonna see enough? You're the world traveller here. Yeah. I think it all sounds pretty good. Except for Paris. How come? You didn't have, like, the best time there? Ah, Paris was okay for me. But I don't know. Maybe you guys will have a different experience. That's actually funny you said that. We were, like, debating should we even fit it into our trip or not. - Yeah. - What do you think? I mean, I wanna see it. I think we should, you know? Just go experience it for ourselves. Might as well. While we're here, you know. But for today, we have Venice. - That is true. - That is true. Salute. - It's good, too. - Yeah. What are you guys gonna get? - Pizza. Pizza. - Pizza. Pizza. Craving it all today. - I know. - I know. For real. Wow, this view is amazing. Yeah, it's nice. No, I'm good. It's crazy. You can see the whole city from up here. Yeah, man. I feel like all we've been doing is travelling. We might need to like, slow it down a little bit, you know? Anthony, my man, you slow... down, you die. I know. Yeah, yeah. Maybe this is just, like, a little different, though. Yeah, I don't know, man. You ever just feel like life is just catapulting you towards something? Some greater purpose? You sure that's just a cigarette? If not, I might need to hit that. No, man, I'm serious. Like... Sometimes, I don't even feel like I have a choice, you know. Like life is just pushing us towards something. Maybe it's, like, life is meant to slow us down sometimes, too, you know. Yeah, well, not today, my friend. We got to get up early for Berlin tomorrow. Rescue Alek from that exchange student. You're right. On to the next, I guess it is. - Yep. - I'm pretty tired myself. It's been a long day. Almost there. This way. Keep up. All together this way. And now you see this is a very important site. This is the Fuhrerbunker. This is one of the more important sites in our history, and it is one of the, perhaps, lesser studied sites. This is where Hitler killed himself, as Russian forces were closing in. Wait, for real? But I thought Hitler killed himself in the Eagle's Nest, with the American forces closing in. No, your American textbooks are wrong by about 700 kilometres. The Kehlsteinhaus is down in the south and Hitler was here with his wife, Eva, and it was the Russians who were closing in. You Americans can't take credit every time evil is defeated. Ja? Off we go. This way. ♪ Springtime for Hitler ♪ ♪ And Germany ♪ Left. Hey, I'm about to go check my emails or something. Text my dad. All right. I'm just gonna go grab a drink. I'll be back in, like, a little bit. All right, sounds good. - Hi, how you doing? - Hallo. Can I just get a pint, please? Stein. Beer. - Ja. - Thank you. So what do you think about France? Do you think it's worth going? Where are you from? Oh, California. Sacramento. Awesome. California. A beer for me, please. Where are you headed next? We're gonna go to France, and then I think we're gonna finish our trip off in Spain. And Amsterdam? Ah, we thought about it. I don't think we're gonna have enough time. Oh, make time for Amsterdam. I just got back from there with my band. Excuse me. And I tell you, one of my favourite things to do when we're up there. What's that? I got some truffles. Head out to the countryside. And you know what I do then? What? What's that? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I do nothing. I just look at the nature, birds, songs. They sing everything. That doesn't sound too bad to me. - Making friends? - Yeah, man. This is Anthony. Oh, hello. How are you? How you doing? Nice to meet you. He's been telling me about Amsterdam. - Oh, for real? - Oh, Amsterdam. - Good things? - Very good things. If you don't take all the drug I do, Amsterdam is fantastic. The most nice people in the world. That's what we've been hearing. And beautiful women, too. - That's what we are after. - We might have to go see that. We just might have to. And history. Don't forget the history. Of course, the history. All history is necessary for life. - To Amsterdam. - To Amsterdam. - It's settled. - He persuaded us. It's done. Just like that. Can I get two Red Bull and vodkas and one beer? Sure. Alek, here, hand one to him. - Hey, it's different, huh? - What is? This. Different from what you've been doing. Man, it's the same damn thing we've been doing. Remember the Perversion Excursion, baby? Hey, come on, now. You know I don't remember that. Is this really what you guys have been doing this whole time without me? Yeah, man. Aren't you glad you came? I really am. - Yeah. - Bought you drinks. Hey. - Cheers. Cheers. - Hey, let me get in that. Cheers. Hey. I'm about to make it rain. Not as easy as it looks. Guys, we need to get up. It's almost noon. I feel miserable. Last night. Man, last night. I still can't believe I got on that stripper pole. So hungover. Let's go get some food or something. - No, no. - No, no. No, thank you. Just water. - More water please. - Okay. Man, last night was crazy. This morning, though. - Painful. - That's the word. - Shit. Even words are... - Painful. There it is. Guys, we need to talk about Paris, though. I mean, like, at this point, why even leave Amsterdam? That was our best night yet. Don't you think? Yeah. Weren't you guys saying that everyone you ran into was anti-Paris? I mean, I guess. They didn't have anything good to say about it, that's for sure. Thank you. Or grazie, or danke. Whatever. - Just thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. So you guys just wanna skip Paris? Or at least delay it a little bit. I'm starving. Maybe it's like you were saying, life's kind of catapulting you towards something. Right now it's catapulting me towards some hangover food. Wait, what did you say? I don't know, man. It was something I said in Venice. I was caught up in that European high. - I'm not gonna lie. - No, no. You should have heard this guy. He was talking about how life is catapulting him towards something, like some greater purpose or something like that. - Spencer said that? - I know. Deep shit, right? Do you still think that? I mean, I guess. But nothing's actually stopping us. If we weren't meant to be on the train tomorrow, something would physically stop us. An object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a greater force. Okay, Isaac Newton. I'm telling you, man, he's been deep as hell on this trip. I can't even deal with it. I mean, people are telling us that the French are the king of the rude. I wouldn't exactly call that a greater force. Plus, we already bought our train tickets, so... So, you guys just wanna stick to the original plan? Might as well. I just need my selfie with the Eiffel Tower and we're good. Hey, can you, like, take a candid photo of me and the train station? All right. You realise it's not candid if you ask me to take it though, right? Just get me from the side or something like that. All right. All right, there you go. You only took one photo. Yeah, so? I think it looks good. I need multiples, man. Because I mean, I know I look good. But I need options. Guys, come on. - That's us? - Yeah, let's go. All right. - You ready? - Let's do this. Look, there's some guys here. Excuse me. Terribly sorry. - Hello. - Hello. Would you mind helping my dad on board the train? - Oh, of course. Yeah, sure. - With his suitcases. Thank you so much. That's so lovely. Give that to Spencer. Thank you very much. I'm sorry to accept but it does help. - No problem. - Thank you. That's so kind. If it doesn't go, you can carry me all the way to Paris, - can't you? - I'll give it a shot. Yeah, God bless you. Excuse me. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Watch your step here. That'll be fine. Yes. Yeah. God bless you. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you so much. Our seats are those. Yes, they are. We're here. Thank you so much. - Okay. - God bless you guys. - No problem. - Yes. Ah. - Thank you so much. Wonderful. - Thank you. - Have a good trip. - You too. You guys have a great trip. Thank you. - Thank you, thank you. - No problem, sir. Bye-bye. You guys just wanna sit here? Yeah. Looks good. Bye, Amsterdam. I'm kind of sad to leave it. It was fun. - I know, really. - Me too. It was a blast. All right. I'm tired of this. And I'm bored. I'm gonna go check the Wi-Fi in first class. - I'll be back. - All right. We should have brought some snacks. You know he gets cranky. Even I could go for a snack. Probably the perks of first class. Maybe we should go find those seats. Right now, I just need some Wi-Fi so I can upload these pictures. Found it. First class is up there and the Wi-Fi is way better. Let's go up. - Sweet. - Perfect. It was nice meeting you. Safe travels. Thanks so much. This is way nicer. I told ya. I'm gonna get that window seat. Sure, man. Whatever. Thanks. I'm gonna take the solo. Snacks coming in, twelve o'clock. Gentlemen, may I offer you some snacks or a drink? - Yeah. Could I get a Coke? - Sure. Thank you. There you go. Can I get some red wine, please? - Sure. - Thanks. - Thank you. - For you, sir? Can I actually have a red wine as well, please? - A red wine? - Yeah, please. Thank you. Please let me know if you need anything else. Oh, we will. Hurry up and drink this shit so we can ask her to come back again. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Look at the baby soda, Spencer. Alek, shut the heck up. So cute. I'm about to go to sleep. I guess nap time it is. Can't hang. Get out of here, it's serious. I've got the gun. Spencer, go. Get the gun. Holy shit. He's got a knife. Get him off me. Shit. I got his arm, I got his arm. Stop resisting. - Stop resisting. - Hold him down. I got him. Shit. I can't hold his arm. Move. Move. - Grab his arms. - Get it, get it. There you go. Dude, that's it, that's it. You got it. You got it. Guys. Guys. This guy's been shot. This guy's bleeding, he needs help. - Hold him down. - Go, I got him. Move, move, move. Mark. Mark. - Mark. Mark. - Shit. Help him please. Could you help him, please? I got it, I got it. Please, help him. Can you help him? We need something to tie him up with. No, just take him. Hold him down. Okay. He's got another one there. Look, he's bleeding here, too. I got it, I got it. You're gonna be all right, man. He's bleeding from here, too. Look. You're good. I'm here, man, I'm here. Don't worry. Hey, try not to move, okay? You guys got him? I'm gonna go clear the other cars. Listen to me, all right? Listen to your wife. It's okay. See, when you move like that, we can't do that, all right? - All right. - Okay? Don't move, Mark, please. Stay with me. If I lose it, you're gonna die, okay? - Okay. - I know you're hurting, but don't move, okay? Listen to me. Listen to me. I love you. I love you, too, baby. You stay with me, okay? - Hey, Mark? Mark? - Yeah. Hey man, do you wanna say a prayer? - No, thanks. - No? He's not ready to go. - Okay. - He's just not ready to go, okay? No, no. It's okay. Anybody got a towel? Anything. Anything. It's okay. It's okay. No, no, it's okay. He's a good guy. He's helping us. Is anybody else hurt? No. It's okay. It's okay. Tell everybody just to stay back here. Okay. Just take the tie. Go on. Get it around under his arm. Under his arms. - Madam. Madam. - Yeah. Okay, I need you to talk to him. Help me keep him awake. Hey. Hey. - What's your name? - Mark, you're gonna be okay. Mark. Mark. Hey, I'm Spencer, man. Hey, it's gonna be all right. We got it. Okay? I'm cut up a little bit, too. You're gonna be okay. It's gonna be all good. All right? We stopped the bleeding. Where are you from? Virginia. Virginia. Hey. I'm from California, man. We're both Americans. I love you, okay? Don't go. You're gonna be all right, all right? We're gonna get some beers after this. It's gonna be all good. - Look at how lucky we got. - Shit. It's, like, one in a million. Spencer, Spencer. Here. I got a sweater so we can stop the bleeding. Can you use this sweater? Yeah, that's okay. I got it. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? - Anthony. Anthony. - Yeah, what do you need? I need a med kit or something to cut his clothes off with. Okay. I'll try and find something. Come on. Let's get out of here. They have to have one. Yeah. I got you. I got you. It's gonna be okay. Hey, man, I need you to stay awake, okay? Keep your eyes open. Focus on your wife. - Stay with me. - Come on, man. Hey. We're gonna get to the train station. We're gonna get you some help, okay? You're good. Stay with me, please. Stay with me. Okay. - Okay? Just stay with me. - Okay, okay. Still bleeding in the back. It's okay. I can't deal with that right now. Hey. That's the guy you want, right there. He's out. Can you hear me? Did you stop the bleeding? Is he the gun shot? I know you're in pain. Don't move, okay? Just don't move. There's a guy back there got shot. He's bleeding. You're almost there, man. The paramedics are coming. You're gonna make it. They're coming, just hold it. Here they come right now. Just hold it, man. You made it, man. Come on. They're coming, Mark. They're coming, okay? They're gonna take you to a hospital. They're gonna take care of you, okay? Okay. They'll take care of you. You made it this long. They're right here, Spencer. No, no. Stop, stop. Okay, look. Come here. You see? Okay. One, two, three. Go, go, go. - Hey. - It's okay? - Yeah. - Feels okay? Yeah, yeah. Where are we going? What are we doing here? Walk this way? Okay. Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. And where there is sadness, joy. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen. Good afternoon. Thank you. Hey, hon. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Today we are here to celebrate four men. Who, by their courage, saved lives. Who showed, by example, what is possible to do in these types of dramatic situations. One need only know that Ayoub El-Khazzani was in possession of 300 rounds of ammunition to understand that we narrowly avoided a tragedy. In the name of France, I want to thank you for what you did. Since Friday, the entire world has come to admire your courage, your calm under pressure, your spirit of responsibility. Your heroism must be an example for all, and a source of inspiration. Faced with the evil of terrorism, there is the good of humanity that you incarnate. Anthony Sadler, you summed up better than anyone, what should be learnt from this lesson. You said, "In a moment of crisis, I would like people to understand that you have to do something." Yes. You have to do something. That day on the train, these men of different nationalities... English, American, French, they created a human community. That of the best to overcome the worst. You risked your lives to defend an idea. The idea of liberty, of freedom. In order to show the gratitude of the French Republic. I felt it was important to give you the highest of honours. The Legion d'Honour, to show how grateful we are. I did not want the three Americans to go back to their country without receiving this honour. The Legion d'Honour rewards your courage, but also extraordinary act of humanity, that you showed on the Amsterdam-Paris Thalys train while on France's territory to save the lives on this train, and to save humanity itself. Thank you. Whoo. Alek Skarlatos was also awarded the Soldier's Medal of the United States Army. Spencer Stone was awarded the Airman's Medal and the Purple Heart. Anthony Sadler received the Secretary Of Defence Medal of Valour.
