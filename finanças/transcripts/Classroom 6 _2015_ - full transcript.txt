This is Annie Monroe. We are still locked inside building h. Everybody disappeared. If you find this video, please just demolish this entire building. - Annie. - It's not just... what? - ...way out? - Where? There is no way out 'cause we're locked in here! - It's all your fucking fault! - No, stop! - Fucking cunt! - Hey! Take it easy, man. - Fucking deserve this. - Take it easy. This isn't gonna help anything. This isn't gonna help anything! - So what, we just stay here? - It's not gonna help them. - It's not gonna help us. - We should stay here and die? - We need to... - we can't go anywhere else. We're locked in here. We can find another classroom. We can barricade ourselves in till morning. There's got to be like a window or... or an emergency exit. - The building's too old. It doesn't have any. There's windows in the bathroom. - The bathroom has windows. - No, Dan. - No, Dan, don't go. - Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan, you can't go in by yourself. - He's going in there! - Dan, open the door! - I'm trying! - Dan! Why is the camera rolling? Save the battery. Please tell the camera your name and occupation. My name is Stephen Ellis. I am the current news producer for channel 7 news and former news anchor. It was obvious to me when Annie came to us as an intern that she would be one of the best we ever had. She had more energy, enthusiasm, and competency that I'd seen anyone in 30 years pass through here. She started out doing small projects... Community dog shows, if you will, studio infomercials, like how to cook an omelette. But it was obvious that Annie had bigger and better things to do. Okay, can you tell us a little bit about what happened prior to the incidents at the school? - Yes. Annie always brought to me potential projects that she wanted to cover. When she brought the disappearances at the school to my attention, she convinced me that it would make good copy. And we thought it was good idea at the time. Did she get the green light to make the documentary from you? Yes, yeah. We gave it the title... The working title was "classroom 6." How did you feel after seeing some of the footage? I don't know how to explain it. It was horrible. It's just terrible. I... I don't understand it. And so, why are you going public with this now? What do you expect by showing this to audiences? I don't expect anything. I do this in honor of Annie and the missing crew. I... I think Annie would have wanted me to do this, at least. It's the least I can for her. She had a saying... "people need to know what's out there. People need to see this." - No, I'm just joking. Don't film that. That's bad. Cut. Cut. Advertise your own, so they, like, blur out the other, like, detergents and stuff... brands, yeah. All right. Do we need sound up? - Better? Huh? Fix your necklace. Somebody needs to know my name. All right, whenever you're ready. I am standing here with the Dean of the Santa Maria college for the last five years... Oh, my god. - Camera is ready. All right. 3 apple take 4, marker. Whenever you're ready. I am standing here with the Dean of the Santa Maria college for the past five years, Michael Keaton, in front of the mysterious classroom 6, which is ground zero for all the weird things that have been going on around Santa Maria college. Michael, thank you for joining us. Oh, thank you very much, Annie. Michael, can you please tell us a bit more about the disappearances? What has been going on around the time when professor Thomas and miss banks went missing? What did the police find out? Well, the police report was inconclusive. I mean, they never were really able to find any evidence that, you know, professor Thomas and miss banks were having an affair. - Honestly? I think they ran off together. He was a bit freaky, you know. Just, no one really liked him. Did ever anything strange happen while in classroom 6? Oh, yeah. - Yeah, the place is evil. - Hell, yeah. The whole building is evil, honestly. You know, young people have wild imaginations sometimes. I... I mean, I've heard all the stories. I've heard that they were lovers, and they ran away together. I heard that the girl murdered professor Thomas, and I heard it the other way around. But, you know, in the end, none of it matters. I mean, no one is ever going to know for sure... hold on, hold on, Annie. Sorry, boom's in the shot. Can we get that down? Okay, sorry about that. Annie, go ahead. And whenever you're ready. Classroom 6 has been closed ever since the disappearances, and the witchcraft and ancient symbols class has been discontinued. Why is that? Well, you know, there's been a lot of hubbub over this subject... This particular subject. And you know, ever since professor Thomas and the girl disappeared, well, we felt it was for the best that this class be discontinued. Do you know anything about the portals? I don't know. I don't really want to talk about it. He... he was a bit obsessed with portals. - It was kind of weird. - What kind of portals? Portals to another world. Yeah, like another dimension. And it has nothing to do with the possible negative energy - surrounding the class? - No, no, no. Look, it's a matter of respect for the families. And plus, after what happened, and after some jokers, you know, made up these stories, the faculty felt this was the right decision to close down this class. So, there are no more night time classes? No, no, no more night time classes. We're saving on costs. I mean, I know about the portals. You know, I know what they were doing. I studied with them. What were they doing? They were playing with the devil. Do you think hell could be one of those dimensions he would talk of? Oh, definitely. Yeah, definitely. Hell's another dimension. Is my stuff gonna be okay? All right. So, here we are... classroom 6. Huh. So, uh... What do you think happened to Thomas and the girl? I really don't know. Thomas was a very singular man. He didn't have many relatives. Well, nor did she. Just a couple of loners who had a lot in common. All right, well, thank you so much, Dean Keaton. - Okay, all right. - I think we have everything - that we need for now. - All right, then. Fine. Okay, good. Can I... Can I speak to you for a minute? Yeah. Is this camera still rolling? Um, Kurt? Or do you want to... you want to stop? - Yeah, yeah. Shut it down. Now, you listen to me, young lady. I have let you in this classroom so that you can prove once and for all that this paranormal crap does not exist and is not real. - I understand. There's no need to worry. We will not compromise this school's reputation in any way possible. We just want to find out what's going on? - Is that camera still on? - No. What's the red light mean? That just means it's charging, all right? - Okay, all right, everybody out. - Yeah, the battery is... - everybody out of the room. I want you all out. That's it. Classroom 6 is closed. - Are you filming this? - Yeah. - Was it on the entire time? - Of course. What do you think I am, some rank amateur? Jesus. - It was good, though. - Yeah? He's so full of it, and all those students with those portals, and him trying to just hush everything. We need to continue. This is amazing. This is... I can't wait to show this to the boss. This is perfect. There's definitely something going on in there. - Amanda! - What the hell, Amanda?! Amanda! Hey, are you the P.A.'s? Yeah. Oh, gaston, sorry. - Good to meet you, man. - Thank you. - Hi. Kurt. - Hi. You guys look like fresh out of film school. - You went to film school, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, documentary course. - And you? Yeah, um, same... just, I want to be an actress, but I just like being on set. She's good. Cool. - Which one did you guys go to? - New York film... ...uh, expensive. Yeah. I actually hate film schools. I mean, you know, you either got it, or you don't, you know? Well, yeah. Come on, I'm just... I'm messing with you guys, okay? - Okay? - Oh, okay. I got nothing against film schools. - Hello, father ruggero? - Yes. Hi, Annie Monroe. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure. They should have told me that it would be a woman of such grandeur who was coming to interview me. Oh, thank you so much. My, uh... Whole life has been dedicated to explaining the mysterious phenomenon of parapsychology. But in the reality, what I really do is I unmask hoaxers. So, how long ago did you move here? We moved from France around, uh, four years ago here to the United States. Um, we feel people here are more accepting to what we do. Um, classroom 6, for instance, is... is a marvelous example. Very, very elaborate hoax... Very, very elaborate. We are both able to communicate with the spirits, you know, by channeling. That is, we allow the spirits to take kind of a temporary control of our body, you know, to communicate with their loved ones. Father ruggero, in theory, um, how can one open an interdimensional portal? In theory, any reflective surface can be a door to another dimension. In theory. So, you mean, like, um... like a mirror? Correct. If you place two mirrors face to face so that there is the endless tunnel, it is said that it is a way for some things to come through. What sorts of things? Well, once a, uh... Once a portal to another dimension is opened up, anything can come through... Dead relatives, ghosts trying to escape the afterlife, demons. But it is all theoretical. So, you ran a channeling section at the Santa Maria college, is that correct? Yeah, that's correct, yeah. So, were you able to find something? That was probably one of the most... I don't know what I saw, but I've seen so many things, you know? And this one, that was different. That was so powerful. Like, suddenly, you're like... It takes control completely, you know? That was different. Classroom 6 was different. What if I told you that we were going back there to collect more evidence? I'll tell you that some doors should be left closed. That's for sure. So, there you have it. While some experts deem the story a hoax, others still believe there is something evil going on in this building, and that is where we come in. With the help of modern technology, we'll spend the night locked inside building h with no way out until the morning comes. Damn. Kurt. - Why? - What? - I'm sorry. There's a guy in the background. And that's where we come in. With the help of modern technology, we'll spend the night locked inside this building with no way out until the morning comes... Forced to face whatever is in there. Our cameras will be on at all times, and if there something, in fact, going on, our lens will capture it. - How was that, Kurt? - It was good. - Yeah? - It was good. - Okay, cool. Oh! Who is that? - Hi. Hi, there. - All right. - Uh, Annie? - Yeah, Dan, right? - Yeah. - Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. This is Kurt. Hey, how you doing, man? It's hard to see you with that light. Kurt, would you mind... Actually, I'm sorry. Would you mind taking some shots around the school till I actually talk to Dan for a bit? - Yeah, that's fine. - Actually, yeah. I want to talk about the contract. - I read over it. - Okay. And I couldn't find anything about the overtime. We don't have anything in specific. I think we can figure something out if you think that's fine. Are you vegan or vegetarian, so you're like... um, I'm a full-blown vegan. - Oh, vegan, actually. - Yeah, full-blown. Hey, Jerry. Here's some outside shots for you. Oh, man, look at this thing. All right. I only brought one mic, so I'm just wondering, are you the only person that's gonna be talking the whole time? No, no, we're all gonna be interacting. It's just, I'm gonna be... Once I have, you know, all those little bits and pieces that I say, you're pretty much gonna be following me, and we're gonna shoot all of that, so... I don't know if you could hear that. - What? - You hear that air unit? You're gonna have to turn that off as soon as we get started. I don't think that's gonna be a problem, bec... and then we have to cut, we'll just turn it back on. Well, we want to hear whatever is happening, so I don't know. Well, the air unit's gonna be a problem. If there are ghosts... I'm just letting you know that. Okay. What are you going to do with the money? - I don't know. That camera's really bright. Yeah, seriously. Serious. I mean, I get the whole documentary thing, but... I thought you were supposed to be an actress. - Am I a news reporter? - She is. - Yeah. - Oh, no, I'm an actual reporter. - Yeah, we're doing a documentary. - But now I'm a P.A. Oh, by the way, yeah, Kurt. Can you... can you take the shot of the mural over there and just, like, the hallways in general? And just, like, try to give some wideness to it because it does look kind of creepy. We just want to have all that. Thanks. So, sorry, yeah. - Make sure you don't... - bright. Like, the last time I was in here at this place, um, I didn't get any credit. Zero, zero, zero? - No, but... - don't miss what comes next? Of course not. That's... that's all fine. It's a documentary, so we don't... oh. All right. Here we are, room 6. But this one must have saw me. So, I remember, I just felt so... this tile's probably from the Mayans or something. Oh, god. Yeah, this looks promising. I got the sound. Annie? It's not funny. Bitch. Ah, this is creepy. Jerry, if you're seeing this, I think it's beneath the auditorium. I don't... I don't know if that's important, but, uh, yeah, it's kind of stupid. Kind of creepy. Uh, kind of a bit of the heebie-bejeebies. All right, see me running? I'm so afraid. It's like a generator or something. I don't... All right, okay. Definitely a generator. Hm. Another creepy door. Oh, shit, what was that? Annie?! Okay, this is not funny. Seriously? Come on. Jesus. Can't see a damn thing. This is, uh... okay, I think we got enough of this. It's, uh... hm, dark. Oh, what's... Hello?! Somebody down there? Enough of this crap. Annie?! Seriously? You're doing this to me already? - Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie! - What? Are you seriously doing this right now? - What am I doing? - This is not funny, all right? Out of the door... what was I doing? No, no, okay, you know what I'm talking about, okay? No, what are you talking about? Annie, with the banging, seriously? You're gonna lie to me about that, huh? Yes, Kurt, I was banging. - Okay, Annie. Annie. Annie! - Oh, my god, the devil. - Annie, serious, okay? - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Annie, stop it, all right? - I'm done. I'm done. - Come on, nothing happened. Then there's some psychic shit you can do now? - What are you trying to say? - Well, what are you here for? Are you questioning my abilities right now? - Kurt, can I have your phone? - Why? Mine's not working. Shit! Yours is not working, either. - Are you kidding me? It was fully charged. - A watch, a watch. Does anybody have a watch? - No, why? - Yeah, I got one. I got one. What's the time? It stopped. What do you mean, it stopped? Guys, this isn't good. We're on it. There we go. Add some camera shake to it. You can just cut that out, Jerry. Jerry, you're gonna have fun with this in editing. "Do not remove chairs." I like this. "Do not remove chairs." Bam... chair. Well, you can't see it, Jerry, but there's some weird-ass drawing that's right there. See? Oh, shit, it's open. I guess we're getting out of this joint. Let's have a look, huh? Ooh. This location does pay for itself. A little Dutch on that. Dun-dun-dun. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. Thanks for having me. - Yeah, of course. - And this is? Hi, Jack... Jack dogget. Psychic. That's our guy. - Hi. - Annie. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. Why wasn't I told about this? - What do you mean? - I don't know. This guy. Kurt, you're just the cameraman. You don't have to know everything. Come on. Did you know her? What? The girl, did you know her? No, um, but I've heard all the stories. I was in his class before she was. Hey, are you the janitor? Hey, everyone, um, I would just like to have one minute, please. I would like to thank you all for coming here tonight and being a part of this. It really means a lot. Um... Well, I hope you don't mind sleeping bags for one night. Um, and seriously, thank you once again for being a part of this. It is an honor, and I think that together, we'll make a great documentary. Now, Mr. Torres here has been kind enough to, um, let us in. And he will be the one locking us up once he opens up the classroom. So, Mr. Torres? - Yay. - Yeah. Gracias. - Thank you. The lights are right here. - Dark. - There. Well, this is it. No. - Okay. - We'll see what happens. It does look kind of spooky, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, this is terrifying. It reminds me of high school. I don't know what kind of school you went to. You had a great time in yours? Well, better than spooky. - This is where we're gonna be? Really? Dude, there's an "s" there. It says "don't open the windows." That's open. It says "no class." What's with the janitor, though, not coming in? Señor torres? - No. - Oh, no, no, no. No corridor, no... - nobody... nobody needs to know. It's fine. - We won't damage anything. - Here. Nobody will notice that we were anywhere around. Look. Look. Thank you. Si? - Hmm? - Si. Do you want to... do you want to, like, have the camera when he locks the door or something like that? Do what? The camera when he locks the door just to... señor torres? Good night. - That's... - very creepy. - A little bit. - Right? - Right? - Just a bit. - Is it locked? - Yep, no way out. We're trapped! ...there, and opening credits and everything? You're about to see... what are you doing? I'm adding some interesting shots. Can we please take this out of the hallway? - I can take this stuff. - Gaston, make yourself useful. - Annie? - Yeah? Where do you want this? - Uh, here somewhere in the back. - Back there? Yeah, on one of these desks. Where do you want the action shots? We should set these up to be the background. So, the guy... The guy just basically just shut us in. Documentary. What do you think? - Right, this could be. - I don't know. I don't know. I want to see what he feels about it. I'm trying to figure out his reactions. I mean, yes or no. It's not about him because he says that he likes the tension shots. So, we can be truthful to the story, right? - Don't film me. I'm not part of the... or pizza or whatever. Behind the scenes, going in. I don't want to be in the picture for you. - You just talk, right? - Yeah. And you know all the teachers here, right? So, that room can be haunted, right? Is it really? I think he's saying, okay. Jack, are you okay? Yes, uh... Just a little heavy being in here. I'm fine. - I'll be fine. - You mean your memories, - or are you feeling something? - And then I show her my turn. - What did she say? - What do you think she said? - She didn't like it. - Both. - Maybe she wasn't... - no. Man, that guy was something, huh... Mr. Torres? It's a good thing we had you. I didn't understand a word. What was he saying out there? I mean, you saw him, his behavior. He just... He seems to believe that there's something odd going on in here. Just... so, he was just talking about, you know, like I said, not walking alone and staying out of the basement and all that. That was, you know, pretty much it, I think. - Well, what about you? What do you think? I just want to make a good documentary, you know? - And... - That's true. That's why we're here, right? All right, well, I'm gonna go - set up the micro cameras. - Okay, all right. - Okay. - You need a hand, Dan? And camera one is up. And the other one here? - Size... size 32/30. - I know. Did Annie tell you to put a camera - in the women's restroom? - Uh, yeah, man. I'm just gonna cover all our bases. Yeah, sure. Just got to remember to take it down before we leave. Yeah. - Unless... - Very funny. We'll start here where it all began, classroom 6. - The stage... - Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm getting focus. Quiet, please. The stage is set, and we're locked inside cla... Blah. Take it again. The stage is set, and we are locked inside building h. Our search for answers will start here where it all began, classroom 6. Okay, good. Let's go. Cut. So, then, what's the plan? I'm just gonna ask you a few questions for the documentary. - An interview. - Yeah, pretty much. Okay. Prior to beginning my work as a psychic, I took professor Thomas's class on witchcraft and ancient symbols. And how long ago was that? I guess a while ago. I was part of his first class. So, you know this place pretty well, I assume. You could say that, yeah. Um, can you tell us how professor Thomas was in person? He was a very unique individual. He always was so determined to know more about everything. Were you two close? As close as we could, I guess. He was so reserved. He never really got close with anybody. This course has opened my mind to things that I never even knew were possible. And can you tell us exactly what is it that you do? I'm a sensitive to things that most normal people aren't. I can pick up on things that most normal people can't. It's called extra sensorial perception. Can you explain to us what extra sensorial perception is? I can try, um... Basically, it involves the reception of information not through the physical senses... Touch, sight, sounds... But rather sensing them through my mind. So, you're able to sense some sort of paranormal occurrences? Yeah. When I was younger, my mom tried to protect me, and shield me from the paranormal entities that are around us every day. Well, it didn't work. As I got older and I learned more about my gift, I realized that the only way to live with what I can do is to confront these things head-on. And that's why I'm here. And did you try to take place in the mediums' expedition that was allowed in here about a year ago? I did. And they said I was too young and inexperienced. Well, do you feel that tonight, you will succeed in finding something out? I'll say this. I have been waiting to spend a night in this room since Thomas disappeared. If something went wrong here, I'm gonna be able to sense it. S-Something bad happened here... Originated. Originated over here. Sorry. Can you... can you see something? I'm sorry, that's not the way it works. I told you guys that earlier. It... I can't see things. I can feel them. I really don't mean to scare you when I say this, but I feel like we've been watched since we walked through the doors there. You guys ever do one of these without me, bring this. Paranormal investigator's best friend. Most people like to use what's called an emf to detect electromagnetic phenomena or anomalies. This little guy... A hell of a lot cheaper, and I promise you, is just as reliable. But why a compass? I mean, there's the obvious. You get lost, it helps you find your way out. But when you're around an anomaly, the electromagnetism in it causes the needle to start spinning like a top. So, no anomalies in this room? No. As of right now, there are not, but would you mind if we did a full sweep at this point? Oh, go ahead, yeah. - All right, guys. Let's get this and go. I don't like this place. None of us like this place, Kurt. - What was that? What just happened? - Did you get that, Kurt? - Yeah, did you just hit the light switch or something, or... It's fine. These kind of things always happen. - What? Are you feeling something? - The compass isn't moving. There's nothing down here yet. It could be an old wiring problem. Annie, do you have the time? Um... it's 15 past midnight. What, would the time have any influence on the possible apparitions? I can, yeah. Isn't midnight supposed to be the hour of ghosts and ghouls? Spirits of the dead were once human, and sometimes after they pass, the spirits can stay attached to certain times that meant something to them when they were alive. What if it... what do you mean, the spirits of the dead? What if it's something else? It's way too early to even think about that right now. But as the night goes on, I'll be able to tell what's going on here. What is over there? Oh, I think the janitor just said it's some sort of... another exit. But it's probably closed. It's just probably bad wiring. Okay. I don't know, man. This is where I heard weird shit sounds. See, it wasn't us, exactly. - Finally. - Well, yes, I mean... point proven. Knocked down this stuff. What, it knocked down... I... I don't know. I mean, I was here, there was some sounds, and then the next thing I know, it's... it's on the ground. - Well, what about the... Portals? - Portals? - Yeah. You think professor Thomas could have opened a portal? Well, you tell me. No. No, no, no. Professor Thomas had the knowledge to run experiments on that kind of thing, but, no. He wouldn't have even done that. But why not? Well, I mean, there's inherited risk involved, obviously, but, say, hypothetically opening a portal is even possible. - Okay. - Once you open that door, you can't control what comes through. You can't even close the door if you needed to. Okay, well, what if it wasn't him, then? What if it was somebody else? - What, like a student? - Yeah. No, professor Thomas would never involve a student in anything like that, not even me. How can you be so sure? Because it's dangerous, and professor Thomas would never put his students in danger. Let me do one more thing, and then we can get out of here. - I promise. - What are you doing? What are you doing? You of all people should know, Kurt. The human eye can only pick up so much. I didn't know there was an app for ghost hunting. - Kurt. - What? Let's swipe the rest of the place. Yeah, yeah, let's go. What is this? This is an invitation. Huh? Okay, spirits... Active spirits can tend to be very childish at times. What I'm going to do is attempt to make contact and hope that they try and contact us back. With tennis balls? - It's a process, Kurt. You'll see. Is something supposed to happen, or... You just carry these around with you all the time... Tennis balls and a compass? So, do you have specific rooms picked out, or just going by feeling? Actually, yeah, I am. So, nothing? The tennis balls are supposed to spark a reaction from whatever spirits may be in here. Okay. And if we're lucky, they'll throw it back. Shouldn't we stay there to catch it? - Well. - Oh, I was like, "what?" I know that you actually, like, invest in... I want to know what you did. - Is this about the skirt? - Yeah. What was that? - Let's go. - It's 1:30. All right. - Dude, are you coming? - I don't know. Stop. No, I think I'll just stay here. Come on. Come on, come on. Check it out. What the hell, man? Was it what, the wind? All the windows are closed. - It's gonna get you. - Shut up! Kurt, are you sure you set it properly? Yeah, I do this all the time. - God, dude, be careful. These are expensive. If it's broken, it's coming off your paycheck, I'll tell you that, not mine. Your idea, lady. Hold this. Stop. Are you guys scared at all? - No. - No, man. Why would we be scared? Besides, if the guy... The ghost actually tries to come and kill us, I'll just kick his ass. - How are you gonna do that? It's a ghost. Yes, but he'll want to kill us, right? So what happens is that he comes, he kill us... he kills me. I come back as a ghost and kick his ass in the ghost world. Oh, I guess I never thought of that. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, right? No. You know, he comes, he kills you, you die, you're dead like him. You kind of... shit! Who is it? - I don't know. It's blocked. - Ooh, creepy. Let me get a shot of that. - Okay, be quiet. - Shut up a minute. Hello? Hello? - What's the deal? - I don't know. - Steve, is that you? - Who's Steve? - Who's Steve? - Her boss. Oh, yeah, you have no idea what I'm saying. - Annie. - Right. - Hey, Annie. - Hold on. - Annie, come here. - The psychic's calling you. - I'll call you later. What... what happened? Kurt, can... Kurt, can you get this? All right, yeah. Annie, what's the time? It is 1:50. What does that mean? - I think it's starting. - What's starting? What's with the balls? ♪♪ Who's that? All right, guys, just... I need everybody to stay back. I'm gonna try and make contact. Sorry, just... look. You guys might not believe in what I do. I don't expect you to, but for your own sakes right now, everyone needs to mind their surroundings. What, are you feeling something? I don't know. ♪♪ - The lights are out. - I got you. Kurt, can we get some more light in here? Jack? I... I don't... I don't understand. I... I felt something outside, and now I came inside, and the compass isn't moving. W-What are you saying? What does that mean? It means it's not here anymore. It means that whatever was out... when I was outside, whatever was in here isn't here anymore. Well, that's, um... that's exciting. ♪♪ Can we do... can we do a full sweep of the entire floor, just to be sure? Yeah, where do you want to start? Let's just... wait. What? What? I think it's...

It's getting closer. ♪♪ It's... it's almost here. It... Did you see... Kurt, tell me you saw this, okay? - No, I... I didn't. - What happened? The compass... the compass moved. It was here. It was here just now. - No one saw anything. - Well, where is it? I don't know. Maybe it's not powerful to manifest itself yet. Maybe it's still trying to get to that point, but it's not here anymore. What, it passed just again while we were here? Yeah. This is just ridiculous. ♪♪ Dude, that's not funny, man. - Oh, man. - God damn. Oh, man, you should have seen your face. Was that you the whole time? What, what do you mean? Oh. Oh, man, I wish I had the camera. What? Come on. You're taking it way too seriously. Way too serious. I don't even know what I'm saying. You really need to learn how to take a joke, man. Come on. - Annie. - What? - What the hell's going on here? It was one of you guys? - Was it us what? - Don't play around with me. Was it one of you guys? Yes or no? Just... I don't know what you're talking about. - We were all just down the hall. - Well, then who else is here? No one but us, Dan. You guys know something I don't, right? No, Dan, we don't know anything. Just calm down, okay? We're not hiding anything from you. You were far away. You don't know maybe... - Yeah. - You could have heard anything. - Yeah, whatever. Just don't let it happen - again, okay? - Dan. No, I'll call Ellis myself if it happens again, okay? - What happened? - Seriously. We didn't do anything. Dude, what's with the attitude? Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - Come on over. I'm scared. I get it. I mean, this is an abnormal situation. It's okay to be scared. Maybe we should just talk to Annie. - About me being scared? - No, no, no, no. Not about you being scared. I mean, let's talk to Annie about what our next move should be. I just don't want to cause any more unnecessary drama. And I'm telling you that I can't guarantee everyone's safety if people are just running around doing their own thing. Yeah, granted, but we cannot go around and tell people about this. Dan is already paranoid. - And that's fine. He should be paranoid. Something is going on here. The worst thing a spirit can be is unpredictable, and that's exactly what this is. No, guys, look, no, we cannot give up. We cannot leave right now. This... this spirit, this presence that you felt, it's... It's communicating with us. Look, let's make a deal, okay? If this... If this thing becomes dangerous, - you will feel it, right? - Yes. You will feel it, and you will let us know, and we'll get the hell out of here. But for right now, you don't even know what it is. So, how about we stay here and find out? First sign of any danger, and we're gone. I promise. All right. Thanks for being on my side, chicken brain. It is now 3:00 a.m. in the morning, which is also called by many believers the witch's hour, when supposedly evil things happen. As our night in classroom 6 continues, we are already experiencing some otherworldly pheno... shit. Probably a generator. - Hopefully. - Stay here. Don't let anybody leave. I'll go check it out. What, are you going by yourself? - I'm gonna be fine, okay? - No, wait. - Kurt, go with him. - What? - Come on. - Just listen to me. Go with him. - Fine, okay. Oh, shit! Hold up. Jack, wait up. I'm fine, okay? Let's go. I don't like this, man. Why'd the lights go off? - It's an old building, Kurt. It could just be the generator. - Whoa, whoa. - Oh, shit. Tell me I'm not seeing this. Are you scared? I'm sorry, what? Yeah, are you? - I don't know. I guess so. Will you go to the bathroom with me? What, are you scared now? Just... just relax, come on. - I'll be back. - It's gonna get you. - Shut up! - Gonna get you. So, you were you saying? It's not about believing or not for me. It isn't? What's it about? It's about finding the truth and make sure that other people know the truth, as well. Is that a good sign? Does it mean it wants to play? Yes, I am scared. It just... I'm willing to risk it 'cause I want to find out if, you know, there's something after this life. And I feel that this place holds the answer to it. What's so funny? You're what's funny. I mean, come on, afterlife? You guys believe in that crap? Okay, let me tell you something. You live, and then you die, and that's it. It's finished. There's no heaven. There's no hell. You just stop existing, and there's nothing. - You know what, dude? - What? I actually don't think you believe a word that you said. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, for real. I actually think you are more scared than any of us. Yeah, well, why don't you just go fuck yourself? - Guys, come on. Just take it easy. - You know. - What? - I'm not liking your attitude. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, good for you. Thank you. You're starting to be a pain in the ass. Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about it, then? - Nothing. - See? You see that boom? The next thing you say I don't like, I'm sticking that right up your ass, all the way. - It's weird. - What's weird? Oh, shit! Oh, my god! - Just take it easy. Just take it... - Really? - Stop! Stop. I didn't do anything. - What you gonna do now? What you gonna do now, huh? - Get away from me! - What you gonna do now? - Stop! Both of you! - Don't go in there. What are you doing? I'm not! Jack, what the hell was that, man? Anything? It's not friendly, man. We need... holy shit, man! We need to get the others. - Amanda! - Amanda! No, there's something in the bathroom. - Amanda, what's... - what's up? What's up? - Hey, calm down. Calm down. - There was something in there. - Amanda, what's wrong? - It grabbed my hand. - I swear to god. - Jack. Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. - How'd you do that? - What? - Jack. - Don't touch it. We don't know what it is. - You're the psychic. You fucking tell us what it is. Jack. Whatever this is, it's trying to tell us something. Your name on the wall, the attack in here. I don't know, are you... Are you a believer? - No, I believe. I want to go home. Okay, that's enough. - That's enough. We'll get out. - I want to go home. Damned right. We're getting out of here. - We're gonna call someone. - No, we're not calling anybody. We're getting out of here. We're getting out of here now, okay? - I'm done with this shit. - I want to go home. Just go wait outside. - Just stop. Wait for me. We need to go back home and we need to go now. Hello? Isn't there some psychic shit you can do to help us out? - What are you trying to say? - What are you here for? Are you questioning my abilities right now? - What are we paying... - Kurt, can I have your phone? - Why? - Mine's not working. Shit! Yours is not working, either. - Are you kidding me? It was fully charged. - A watch, a watch. Does anybody have a watch. - No, why? - I got one. I got one. What's the time? It stopped. - What do you mean, it stopped? - Guys, this isn't good. This... this entity, it wants to hurt us. It's not friendly. It's not nice. - It's vindictive. - Oh, you're just now telling us? And you're just now telling us this. Wow, thank you. Why is the camera still working? Yeah. I don't know. I did... When this kind of thing happens, everything happens for a reason. So if the camera is the only thing that's working, it wants the camera on. It wants us to see something. The documentary's over. - We're done. - No, it is not. - The doors are locked, man. We can't leave. What do you mean the doors are locked? - The doors are locked. - I thought that was part of the script, you fucking asshole. - No, I'm... - you knew that from the start! Did you hear that? Yeah. What is that? Where is it coming from? Oh, my god. What is that? Careful, man. What is that? - Oh, my god! - Holy shit! - Gaston? - No, no, no, no. - What the hell happened to him? - No, we have to help him. - Don't touch him. - No, we have to call emergency. - What's happening? - Call them with what? Oh, my god, Dan, get the towel, get something. - Gaston! - No, no, no, no. - Don't touch him. - What the hell happened to him? - Don't touch him. - Sorry, Annie. Annie, Annie. We need to go! We need to go! Go now! We don't have a choice. - Amanda? - Where the hell is Amanda? Amanda! - Oh, my god! - Shit. Oh, my god. That's the... The scream, it's not coming... It's not coming... The screams aren't even coming from her. Yes, they are! Amanda? - Amanda? Amanda? - We have to go! We have to go now! Can you... open the fucking door! - Open the fucking door! - Oh, my god! There's got to be another way out. There's got to be another way out. - Where? There is no way out 'cause we're locked in here! - It's all your fucking fault! - No! Stop! - You fucking cunt! - Hey! Take it easy, man. - Don't fucking deserve this. - Take it easy. This isn't gonna help anything. This isn't gonna help anything. - So what, we'll just stay here? - It's not gonna help them. - It's not gonna help us. - Just stay here and die? - We need to... - we can't go anywhere else. We're locked in here. We can find another classroom. We can barricade ourselves in till morning. There's got to be like a window or... or an emergency exit. - The building's too old. It doesn't have any. There's windows in the bathroom. - The bathroom. - No, Dan. - No, Dan, don't go. - Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan, you can't go in by yourself. - He's going in there! - Dan, open the door! - I'm trying! - Dan! Dan, open the door! Come out! Annie! - Annie, get away from the door! - Help! Help! Annie, Annie, get away from the door. - Let me go! Let me go! - Annie, Annie. No, I just want to get out of here! - Annie, listen to me! - I just want to get out, though. - Annie, listen to me. Listen to me. We're safe in the hallway. This thing is in the rooms. It's in the bathrooms. - No, we're not! It's getting stronger. You said it. It's getting stronger. - Annie, listen to him! - No, leave me alone! - Listen! - No! - Annie, stop. Stop, okay? Annie, you need to trust me. - You brought me here for this. - Wait, wait. - Guys, guys. - Kurt. - The handle. - Kurt. - You go check on gaston. - Kurt, god damn it! Dan? Dan? Where the hell are you, man? Son of a bitch. Dan? Dan, Dan! Oh, shit! Shit! Help! Help! Help! Jack! Annie! For the love of god, help me! No, help, help! Help! Jack, Annie! Help, god! Stop! Kurt. What? No, no! - Kurt? - Kurt? - Kurt? - Kurt? - Oh, my god. - Kurt, what happened? - What happened? - There's nothing. - What happened? - Okay, there's nothing! He's not in there, and there's nothing. - Gaston's gone, too. - Oh. Oh, Jesus. Jack, what the shit, man! You're supposed to be the psychic! - What the hell is going on? - I don't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I mean, I don't know! We're safe in the hallway, - oh, yeah, safe in the hallway. For sure. It's in the rooms. It's in the bathrooms. It's not in the fucking hallway! Well, you know what? It's only a matter of time before it is! This is all your fault! Annie, Annie? Annie, it's gonna be okay. We just need to stay here. This is Annie Monroe. We are still locked inside building h, and we have been attacked by some sort of evil force. Everybody disappeared. It's only Kurt, Jack dogget, and myself that are left. If you find this vid... none of this is helping. I'm making a record so everybody's gonna know what happened. - What good does that do? - People are gonna know, and people aren't gonna come in here anymore. What good does that do us? Don't put that shit on her. - Why? It was her idea. - I didn't know. - She set it up. - I didn't know it would happen. She found you, the ghost... Shut up, keep out of this. She found you, huh, the ghost expert, huh? The spirit guide. Lead the way. Look, I told all of you that we needed to leave hours ago. - Jesus. - Okay. - And what? And nobody listened to me. So don't put this shit on me. Don't put this shit on her. It's not even a fucking spirit. It's not. - It's not. - Then what the hell is it, huh? - You were right. - About what? What do you mean she was right? About the portals, about the professor. You think they're in... You think they're in hell? - I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that if he did open a door, then anything with a reflective surface in this whole school is another door. Windows, mirrors, door knobs, drops of fucking water in the bathroom. - Don't laugh. - So, we need... We need to stay together. We need to focus, and we need to keep working together. Working towards what, man, huh? All we're doing is sitting out here. We're sitting ducks. This is the only safe place in the school. Yeah, for now. Who knows how long before it's out here, huh? We got an hour, two hours till the janitor comes back? Yeah, I think so. So, we wait it out. I can still feel this thing. In the classrooms, in the bathrooms, by the doors, but it's not here. It's not in the hallway. - Shh. - I can't take it anymore. I seriously can't. It's... it's not Amanda. It's a trick. It's been setting traps. It's been setting traps for all of us, and that's another one. We need to... we need to... I know we need to block it out. I know it's hard, but we need to block it out. Oh, my god, did you... You hear that? - Annie? - What? Annie, did we hear what? - It's my mom. - What? - It's my mom, you can... - wait, wait. - Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. - Annie, stop. - Annie? Annie? - Mom! - Mom! - No, no, no, no. - Mom! Mom! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Ah, mom! No. No, my mom's voice. It's my mom. - Shh. - Did you know Amanda's voice, too, when she just yelled? - I know my mom. It's my mom. - It's my mommy. - Annie, it's not. - Yes, it is. - It is not. - It's mom. Please. Oh, shit. - It's a trap. It wants to take you. - It wants to hurt you. - Hey! - Get away. My mom wants to help me. - Annie, Annie, Annie! - She wants to help me. - Annie. Annie. - Just let me go! - No, no! Annie! - Help me. - Let me go! - No, stop, stop. - Mom. - Get her on the ground. Get her on the ground. - Annie, Annie, Annie. - We got to stop her. - Annie, let go. - Mom! Annie! - Annie, Annie. - It's my mom. - No one's talking. No one's talking. There's nobody here. There's nobody here. - It was. She's calling me. Annie, what was it saying to you? Annie? Annie, look at me. Annie, what was it saying to you? Jesus Christ, Kurt, she's ice cold. - Oh, god. - I think she's in shock. Annie. Come on. - Annie. Annie, I need to talk to you. - Holy shit, Jack. - Annie, you need to talk. - It's not. - What? The light just went on. - Stay here. Don't let her move. - Jack, come on, man. Don't do anything stupid. If I don't do something, it's gonna take all of us. Annie? Annie, you need to help me. Hey! Hey! - No! - Jack! - Annie! Annie! - Jack? - Jack? - Annie! - Jack! - Annie, open the door! - Jack! - Open the door! - Annie, help me. - Jack, no! - Jack! - Kurt, open the fucking door! Kurt, open the door! Open the fucking door! The other door, the other door, come on. - Annie! - Come on! - Annie! - Here, here! - Jack! - Oh, my god! Shit. - What happened in here? - Shit. Jack? Oh, my god! Help me move these. Jack! Oh, holy shit! - Oh, my god! Oh, no. Oh, my god! Shit! Oh, oh, get out of here! - Run! - Oh, my god! What is... what the... Oh, my god! - Shit! - Oh, my god! Annie, Annie! Shh, shh, shh. Annie, Annie. Easy, easy. You need to stop. Annie. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, please be quiet. Please. Stop. Stop right now. Oh. Oh, my god. Stop right now, okay? Maybe it didn't see us. You need to keep quiet okay? - Just keep quiet. - Okay, okay. Oh, my god! What's always disturbed me... ...i just wonder why the police have never found any bodies. Not even one body. So, where'd they go? Are they in the walls? Are they even in the building? Are they alive or dead? The bigger question is, who or what did this to them? Who took the camera? ♪♪
