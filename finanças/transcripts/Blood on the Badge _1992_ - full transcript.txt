[music playing] NARRATOR: In the heart of the city, it holds back the tide of crime. For the love of god. [gunshot] NARRATOR: In the violent streets, it shines as a symbol of protection. Dallas PD, put your weapons down. NARRATOR: In the dead of night, it struggles against the power hungry men who would make this city their own. And if your boss doesn't like that, you tell him to come down here in person and tell me about it. NARRATOR: It is the only barrier between the city and brutal chaos. [gunfire] This badge. A shocking discovery leads detective Neil Farrow into a maze of perversion, deceit, and political intrigue. Senator Bagley's murder. [gunfire] [explosions] That's revenge. He shot my best friend in cold blood. Bye, bye, cop. [gunfire] NARRATOR: Pushed to the breaking point, Neil Farrow battles the men who have spilled innocent blood on the badge. [glass breaking] SENATOR: Who are you? Why are you doing this? Are you looking for money? TERRORIST: Let's move. Just let me go. What is it that you want? I'll give you anything that you want. Is it-- it is money, isn't it? I don't have any here in the office, but I could get you plenty of money. This is not about money. For the love of God, no. Yes. For the love of God, nothing personal. This is strictly political. [gunshot] [music playing] We'll see you in a bit. Got a light? Sure. Thanks. So what you got from me, Louie? Is anybody watching? No, nobody's looking. Yeah, I'm hurting, man, I really need some money. $20 ain't going to make it this time, man. This is big, and I'm taking a real big risk. How much you want, Louie? $200. [laugh] $200? You got to be crazy. This is a big deal. It's the kind of deal that gives cops like you a hard on. Well, I'll give you $50. Listen to me, you son of a bitch, you're not going anywhere. You dragged me out of my house on my night off. You better have a story for me. It damn well better be a good one. You got me? $200 pays for two weeks my life. You wouldn't risk your life for $200 for the room and board. I do it all the time. I'm a cop, remember. Yeah, well, you've got a job. I'm half blind. I'm crippled. Nobody will hire me. All right. You actually got me feeling sorry for you, Louie. There. Thanks. Don't mention it. Now, this better be good. In that warehouse on Lamar between Commerce and Canton. You know where that is? I know the one. The warehouse, be there at 2,300 hours. Do you think it's wise to be driving this van around? Don't ever question me, Whitney. Do as you're told, and don't be late. REPORTER (ON TV): Israeli-Syrian border. Initial reports claimed Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base, killing at least 40-- Hey sweetheart, can you give me another beer? What am I? You're slave? Yeah, if you want to be. It's good training for being a wife. Easy, baby, I was just kidding. It was a joke, OK? I'll get my own beer . Oh, it's a joke now, but what about after we're married? No way. You know I'm crazy about you. I can't remember the last time we spent a quiet evening at home together. Yeah, I know. Hey, dinner smells great. I'm starving. When do we eat? It's almost ready, and don't you go stuffing yourself either, because I don't want you falling asleep on the sofa. I got other plans for you. Yes, ma'am. Now, let me finish dinner, OK? REPORTER (ON TV): 36 hours of steady rainfall have left many homes in the metro area knee deep in floodwaters. However, those [inaudible]-- Los Angeles played host to still another terrorist bombing, which claimed eight more innocent lives in the mid Wilshire District earlier today. A secret Libyan nationalist group calling itself The Hand of God has claimed responsibility [phone ringing] for the bombing. Hello? Hey, something's up, buddy. I need to get you to come home and check it out. This is a joke, right? - What's a joke? - It's no joke, buddy. Louie just gave me a hot tip. Lanky Louie? You got to be kidding. I can't believe you're still hanging out with that low life. He set us straight on the chain letter killings, didn't he? I believe you got a commendation out of that one. Hey, look, this is my night off, for Christ's sake. Neil says hi. DIANE: Give me that phone, you aren't going out tonight. Honey, honey, sweetheart, let me handle this. Hey, look you're about to get me in trouble with my old lady, uh, with my fiance. Hey, listen, I understand, but you know I wouldn't call you in the middle of the night if it wasn't some deep shit. BILL (ON PHONE): Does Burton know about this? Not yet. Come on, Neil, get real. Look, you just have to count me out this time. OK, fine, hey, I'm going to let you go. I'm going to run over there and check it out myself. BILL (ON PHONE): You sure, man? Yeah, no problem. Give Diane a kiss for me. What the hell? Where do you want me to meet you? At the station no later than 10:30. And don't be late. This thing is supposed to go down at 11:00. Hey, and tell Diane I'm sorry and I'll make it up to you guys. Yeah. I'm sure she'll understand. She's wonderful. Understand what? I don't understand crap. Give me that phone. BILL: It's too late. He hung up. You're not going out tonight. BILL: Just let me tell you what's going on, OK? You're not going out of here. You remember BR, don't you? DIANE: Yes. You remember when he told us his definition of a friend? He said that a friend was someone that you could call at 3:00 in the morning and say, meet me on the worst corner of town and bring a gun, and they'd show up, no questions asked. Neil is the only person I know who would do anything for me, no questions asked. So what's your definition of a wife? Somebody who will put up with this BS? Somebody who will go along without complaining? Bill, don't you see? Sometimes I have to come first. Diane. Diane. [music playing] I don't see much going on here, partner. Are you sure this is for real? We're early. I told you the deal goes down at 11:00. I can't believe you gave Lanky Louie $200. We need to get inside here. How do you want to do this? Through the use of high technology. [breaking glass] What? I don't believe you did that. It's just a little broken glass. Which the city is going to have to pay for. Hey, forget the city. You pay for it. You gave Lanky Louie $200. You shouldn't mind shelling out for a pane of glass. [breaking glass] You put the ring in a safe place I hope. What? I said, you put the ring in a safe place, right? I don't know what you're taking about. I said, you put the ring in a safe place, right? Yes, I put the ring in a safe place. And yes, I rented my tux, and yes, I paid for the wedding. [kiss] I just don't want anything to go wrong. That's all. I mean, this wedding means so much to Diane and to me. It's one of those things you only do one time in your life. So it might as well be right, right? Hey, man, are you getting any of this? Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Listen, Bill, I know I really screwed stuff up for you and Diane tonight. I'm sorry. She'll get over it, I hope. This is going to make you a big hero. She'll be proud of you. Bingo. Looks like Lanky Louis set us straight. Ammo clips, fully loaded. Neil, what have we stumbled onto here? Another ad scam. I don't know. There's enough firepower here to destroy half the city. I think we better call for backup. [electric sound] Is, uh, is it clear? Get to it. Yes, um, I-- well, everything looks secure. I suppose I'll start with the inventory. We're waiting. [music playing] The driver's getting nervous. He wants to know how much longer. You tell that chickenshit if you don't stop asking stupid questions, he won't be able to get a job driving a garbage truck. After I finished with him, he won't be able to walk. Got that? Yes, sir. [music playing] TERRORIST: Come on. let's move it. I want this stuff loaded and rolling in 10 minutes. Maybe this is some of the Libyan terrorists we've been hearing so much about. They're not speaking with an accent. Maybe the Libyans are recruiting local talent. Maybe. You're holding up my men, Bill. Yes, sir, I realize that, but there seems to be a problem. In addition to the missing hand grenades, one of the crates has been tampered with. Two of the rifles are missing. This is it. Let's do it. Look in, Police Force. [gunfire] Don't be stupid. Dallas PD, put your weapons down. What's the problem, officer? You're all under arrest for smuggling stolen government property. Drop your weapons now. What's going on in there? There's a couple of cops inside. Uh-uh. Try to leave, and I'll kill you. You got it? Good. Now, you just wait here. I'll be back. You've got it all wrong. We work for the government. That's just fine. Then y'all wouldn't mind coming down to the station to meet the captain. Everybody, fall in. [music playing] [gunfire] This is one hell of a bachelor's party you're throwing for me, old buddy. Thanks a lot. Don't mention it. [music playing] [gunfire] When does the girl pop out of the cage? About any minute now. Good. Because I wouldn't want to miss that. I guess it's a little too late to call for a backup. I wouldn't worry about it, because with all this automatic weapons fire, this place will be surrounded by black and whites in no time. [music playing] Let's go! If we move, we're dead. No, if we stay, we're dead. [gunfire] You want to stir up some real trouble? What now? [gunfire] [explosion] [alarm] Hear that? It's about time. [gunfire] They're clearing out. Cover me. I'm going to get this guy. [music playing] [groan] Everybody out, now. [gunfire] Neil! Neil, are you OK? [gunfire] [groan] [thud] Shit. Bye, bye, cop. [gunfire] Bill? Bill, are you all right? TERRORIST: I'm afraid Bill has had a little accident. [tire squeal] [gunfire] Bill, Bill, can you hear me? The Hand of God did this. It looks like the wedding is off. No, shh. Now, you listen to me. You are going to make that wedding if I have to carry you all myself. Listen, I spent too much money on that damn tux. Just sit tight. We'll call for-- we'll call for an ambulance, all right? No, don't. I may not be here when you get back. Bill, hang on, all right, bud? Hang on. Neil. Get that bastard for me, will you? We're going to get him together. Tell Diane I'm sorry. I love her very much. Bill, Bill, Bill? Bill? No, Bill, don't quit on me. Bill, don't fall asleep. Bill! Bill! Bill! WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Telephone, please, Dr. Davis. Telephone, please. Diane. Hi, Diane. I called the house earlier. Did you get my message? Yes. I just wanted to let you know that I'm sorry. God, I feel responsible. You should. It's because of you that he's in there. I know. I talked to one of the doctors earlier. They said that there was a chance that he could pull through. Diane, he's not dead yet. It will be easy if he was dead. At least that way, I would know what to do. I could-- I could get on with my life-- Why don't you just leave, man? Can't you see she doesn't want to talk to you? Diane, I promise you I'm going to get those guys that did this to him. You are the guy who did this. [crying] WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr. Jay Hamilton, Dr. Jay Hamilton. Hmm. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. That's not what I hear. What I hear is that you're going to try to go after Bill's-- Bill's assailant. Well, you heard right. Well, I'm telling you this, mister, as of right now, you are on two weeks leave of absence, two weeks. I want you to use his time constructively. I want you to get this unfortunate incident off your mind. We all know that you and Bill were very close. We are close. Everyone around here seems to forget that Bill is not dead yet. All right, sorry. Look, Bill knew the risk when he took this job. We all do. Things like this happen. It happened to Bill, OK? I'm going to get the guy that did this to him. If that was me laying there in that bed, Bill would do the exact same thing. You're taking this thing too personally. I am going to get the guy that did this with or without your help, sir. This guy was a thief, a gun runner, and now he's an attempted cop killer. He shot my best friend in cold blood. So you do whatever you got to do. You can take my gun, you take my badge, do it all. I am going to get this guy. Got it? That's revenge. What good is it going to do? Why don't you ask her that question? Diane is pregnant. Do you have any leads? I've got one. Whatever you want, you've got. [music playing] Hog Farm. No, Hog, H-O-G. Right, like an adult pig, jeez. Judy, you're so quick. Say, could you, uh, check that out. Yeah it's Hog Farm sausage. Yeah, check it out, and give me a call. Thank you. Bye. I, uh, I have something I think should be of special interest to you. NEIL: What's that? Surveillance tape, Senator Bagley's murder. You've got to be kidding me. Have a look. Let's do it. All right. Show you what you've got here. SENATOR (ON TV): What is it that you want? That your man? Yeah. SENATOR (ON TV): Money, plenty of money. TERRORIST (ON TV): This is not about money. The infamous Hand of God we've been hearing so much about. SENATOR (ON TV): I don't have any here in the office. These guys aren't Libyans. SENATOR (ON TV): I can get you plenty of money . That's what everyone says who's seen this tape, must be recruiting our own thugs off the street, using our criminals against us. You think it's possible the Libyans don't have anything to do with this? I think it's very possible. You mind if I hang onto this tape? No, it's fine. You, uh, you just stay in touch, all right? [music playing] TERRORIST (ON TV): This is strictly political. [static] Neil, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Hi, Bill. Open your eyes. Your brother gets shot, and he's trying to tell you something. He's not your brother? You're right. He's no brother. I think this is everything you requested. Sign the bottom line, please. Give me a holler when you're finished. Is it all right if I smoke in here? Sure. Just don't get caught. NEIL: Got you. [music playing] Yeah, you bet, Howard. I owe you a big one. All righty, bye, bye. Neil, your friend Judy has delivered. They found your pig farm. NEIL: Great. Cedar Hills. That sounds familiar. Uh-huh. It's a couple miles drive south of here. It's Morgan County. What do you think it would take to get local cooperation? BURTON: I'm way ahead of you. There's a sheriff down there by the name of Howard Bigelow. He's, uh, he's going to be waiting for you. You know, I don't care what they say, you're all right. Well, maybe you should care. It's all true. Get the hell out of here. [music playing] Detective Farrow? Yes. Hi, I'm Detective Webber. Welcome to Morgan County. Come on, I'll escort you down to the Sheriff's office. OK, thanks. I'm really looking forward to working with you, Detective Farrow. Please, call me Neil. I've been assigned to help you out at least during the Morgan County part of your investigation. Detective Webber, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Please, call me Jenny. Jenny. How old are you? 24. 24. Look, Detective Farrow-- Neil. Look, Neil, since we're going to be working together, I want to dispel any misgivings you might have about my age or my sex. I've spent the last six years at Harvard pursuing a master's in criminal law, most of this year at the Texas Police Academy where I graduated fifth in a class of 267 candidates. Mhm. Sheriff, this is Detective Farrow from Dallas. Yes, welcome to Morgan County, Detective. Nice to meet you, sir. I just want you to know that Detective Webber and her car are at your disposal 24 hours a day. Well, I appreciate that. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I did bring my own car, and I would prefer to work alone. Hmm, that's out of the question, Detective. See, we live in a pretty close knit community here, and that's something I'm afraid you wouldn't be familiar with, being from the big city of Dallas and all. I wouldn't be so sure of that. SHERIFF: See, I am responsible for your safety while you are down here in Morgan County. If anything should happen to you, I'd never forgive myself. Well, I appreciate your concern, but I-- Oh, it's more than a concern, Detective, it's an order. Now, this is my jurisdiction. You understand? - Yes, sir. SHERIFF: Good. Now, I think you'll find that my niece, Detective Webber, is a very capable law enforcement officer. You're going to find she is going to be a lot of help to you. Why don't you two run on now and see what you can come up with? DETECTIVE WEBBER: Uncle Howard can be a little difficult to get through to. NEIL: Uncle Howard? DETECTIVE WEBBER: The Sheriff is my uncle. That doesn't make me any less qualified to help you investigate-- [pig sounds] How could I help you folks? Yes, Detective Farrow, Dallas Police Department. Detective Webber, Morgan County. Dallas? What can I do for you? We have reason to believe that one of your vans was used in the commission of a felony. One of our vans? I don't believe I got your name. I'm Clint, Clint Hardin, foreman here. Who is it we need to speak with? Milo Truscott. Mr. Truscott is not here. He and an assistant took a horseback ride. I don't know when they'll be back. Anything I can do? The description of the truck that was used in the crime scene in Dallas matches the one I see over there. Do you mind if I have a closer look? Sure, come on. What is it you think our truck was used for anyway? Smuggling stolen weapons from Dallas. Whoa. How many trucks like this one does the Hog Farm have? We've got two. The other one is making deliveries up in the hill country. There's some pretty special ingredients in our sausage. We're real particular about who sells it. Oh, here's Mr. Truscott now. [horse whinny] What's up, Clint? Detective Farrow, Dallas Police, and, uh-- Detective Webber, Morgan County. Detective? What's all this about? NEIL: Mr. Truscott, I believe that this truck was used to smuggle stolen weapons from a warehouse in Dallas three nights ago. Well, now I've heard everything. Is this a joke? This is no joke, Mr. Truscott. Can you tell me where the van was three nights ago? Three nights ago, Monday. Clint, help me out. Who was using the truck on Monday night? Milo. Have you been smuggling guns in that sausage of yours? Baby sister Sandra. You'll have to excuse her sense of humor, but you've got to understand this all seems a little far fetched to us. David Speer. Speer had the truck that night. He was supposed be making deliveries over in Tyler. David Speer? S-P-E-E-R? Could we speak to Mr. Speer? Sure, if you can find him. I fired him yesterday for drinking on the job. Can you tell us his last known address, telephone number, social security number, things of that nature? Sure. Clint can get you all of that stuff. You know Detective Farrow and Detective Webber-- Webber? You must be Sheriff Bigelow's niece. Yes, that's correct. I believe we met at a fundraiser a couple of years back. Good to see you again. Thanks. Mr. Truscott, can you think of any reason why David Speer would use your truck to commit a felony? No, in fact, I was about to get to that. You see, it's no secret that I'm a very political man. I use my money and influence to lobby for causes I believe in. It's also no secret that I have enemies. Now, I'm a lot more inclined to believe that someone deliberately tried to implicate me by dummying up a truck to look like one of mine. It could be. This whole thing is strictly political. TERRORIST (VOICEOVER): This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. This is strictly political. Detective Farrow? Detective Farrow, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I was just thinking. This David Speer, is he a black man? No, he's white. Most my employees are black, but old David's a white boy. Well, the reason I ask that question is because the men who were using the truck were all wearing masks, all but one, a black man. Is there a possibility that any of your other men may have used the truck that night? Possible, but not likely. Is there any reason to believe that any of your black workers might have ties with the Libyan group, The Hand of God? [laugh] For crying out loud, Detective, is that what you think? All the black men that work for me are like old Randy over there. It's a constant tool just to get them to show up for work. They don't have the kind of ambition or energy it takes to be a terrorist. Randy, Randy? Am I telling this detective the God's truth when I say you local niggers are just too damn lazy for terrorist work? Yes, sir, Mr. Truscott. I'm afraid so. Ain't no since of lying about it. It's got some truth. Thank you, Randy. [music playing] See what I mean? There you go. Thank you. Well, I hope you catch up with that rascal, Speer. But I think you're going to find that the truck used in Dallas is not one of mine. Oh, it was your truck all right. How can you be sure? Do you have a license plate number? No. Well, then. You know what that is? That's a bullet hole. I put it there myself. Bravo, Detective. You have quite a flair. [horse whinny] We'll be leaving now. I'm sure we'll talk again. Call any time. You're always welcome. Bye now. I hope to see you again real soon. Bye. [music playing] Is everybody in this town a bigot? No, well, I don't know. Look, I don't like it any more than you do. I don't mind telling you this, it pisses me off. Really? Really. You better learn to exercise a little decorum, young lady. You are a Truscott. What's wrong, Milo? Did those detectives make you nervous? Do not embarrass me in front of strangers, Sandra. Or what? I want you to keep tabs on Mr. Farrow. How about Speer? I want a word with Mr. Speer before he talks to Farrow. [phone ringing] Farrow speaking. Yes, Neil. Yes, this is Burton here. What did you find out about the pig farm? The truck is there. Some local big shot named Milo Truscott owns the place. I think he's involved in some local politics or something. He's involved in all kinds of politics. The man has big friends in the State Department end in Washington, DC. Well, I'm impressed. He's just a big grinning good old boy, and he's got a big attitude towards blacks. So what about the truck? Uh, well, supposedly a guy by the name of David Speer was driving the truck, and I haven't been able to locate him yet. I guess I'll stay here till I do. All right, OK, what about this Truscott character? You think he has anything to do with the weapons? I don't know. I do know one thing, I don't like the son of a bitch. Listen, the Feds had called in some sort of Middle Eastern weapons terrorist expert of some such. His name is Fred Hackerman, Heckerman. Anyway, the guy is in town for a couple of days. I've schedule a meeting here, a private meeting, at my office 3 o'clock tomorrow. I want you to be here. Yeah, no sweat. How about Lanky Louie? Has anybody been able to locate him yet? Yeah. Old Lanky Louie is hiding out someplace. And I can't say as I blame him. [music playing] [door knock] Who is it? MAID: Maid, sir. Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but we're checking all the rooms on the floor so you could have fresh towels. The day maid quit this morning, but I see we're already too late. Yeah. I'll just put these in the bathroom so you have fresh towels in the morning. Have a pleasant stay, mister-- Farrow, Neil Farrow. You are? I'm Caroline. Just holler if you need fresh towels, or anything. Uh, Caroline? Yes, sir. I'm obviously from out of town. I, um, where would a guy go if he wanted a drink around here? Well, my favorite spot is Tom Dooley's just a few blocks down the street. We usually go there after every shift. It's a nice place. I'll have to check it out. Maybe I'll see you there. Maybe. [music playing] One more. You got stood up, huh? Looks that way. Women, can't live with them, and you can't live without them. How true. That's for you. Thanks. Hi. Well, hello. Would you like something to drink? I'll have a Perrier. Coming right up. You a heavy drinker? Well, Mr. Farrow, what brings you to town? NEIL: I work for the Dallas Police Department. And we're on a case. Oh, really? Some kind of drug deal or something? Or something. [music playing] What the hell? TERRORIST: Good morning, Congressman and Mrs. Seagram. What do you want? You, Congressman, we want you. For crimes against your race and nation, we hereby sentence you to death. You? Yes, it's me. You should've kept your promise. You must be insane. I don't like that word. [gunshot] [scream] [thunder] [thunder] Well, looks like we're going to get wet. I already am. [soft, romantic music] [thunder] [thunder] Bill? What are you doing here? I'm sending you some help, tomorrow. I don't understand. Watch your back, man. You're in deeper than you think. But Bill-- Shhh. Tomorrow. So what do you got on Speer? Nothing yet. How about Truscott? Yeah, here it is. What is this? What? New Day Survival Camp? Truscott owns a survival camp? Yeah. You knew about this? Sure, it's common knowledge. Why didn't you tell me about this? I don't know. It never came up. I'm investigating a guy who may be dealing in stolen military weapons? And you don't think it's worth mentioning that he owns a survival camp? I didn't say it wasn't worth mentioning. I said it hadn't come up yet. Just when the hell was it going to come up? The man owns a survival camp. You obviously have a very media affected concept of what a survival camp is. So Milo Truscott owns one. That doesn't make him a kook or a terrorist. It's no secret he's an NRA supporter. At this point, I'd say it's just as likely he was set up as it is he had anything to do with your terrorists in Dallas. Excuse me? Just whose side are you on? The law's. And when you can prove that Milo Truscott has broken a law, I'll be right there to help you put the cuffs on him. Until then, he's innocent until proven guilty. And this investigation will be conducted in an impartial and objective manner, and you will not bully me or insinuate I am not taking my job seriously. You got that? Was it something I said? Good. Now would you like to go visit the New Day Survival Camp? Yes, I would like that very much. Let's go. Do you ever think that maybe you're just a little too objective for a cop? Don't you think it's about time we had a few cops like me? [gunshots] OK, folks, not too bad, folks. Not too bad at all. I actually see some improvement. But Annie, darling, you simply mustn't be afraid of your weapon. Well, I'm not exactly afraid of it. It's just so big. Would it be all right if I used a smaller bore? Oh, Annie, you want the largest weapon you can handle, the one with the most stopping power. In a combat situation, your adversary may be so pumped with adrenaline that a small-bore weapon just won't bring him down. You want a big bullet, because a big bullet makes big holes in bones and organs. Remember, on the day of reckoning when all hell is breaking loose, your weapon will become your best friend. Read it as such. OK, now, yes, may I help you? Detective Farrow, Dallas Police Department. Jennie Webber, Morgan County. I understand that Milo Truscott owns this place. I'd like to speak to him. Just a moment, please. All right, everyone, we're all finished with target practice today. If you'll move on down to the obstacle course, I'll be with you directly. Now, what is it you want? We'd like to speak to Milo Truscott. Milo Truscott, yes, well, uh, he's not around at the moment. Perhaps I can help. I knew it, Milo. I knew it. He's tracked us down. I told you it was a mistake to use that van. He knows what I look like. He's got to go, Milo. Damn it, I told you we shouldn't use that van. Listen to me. He's seen me. He knows what I look like. He can identify me. Maybe I should have Clint change your looks for you. Even your own mother wouldn't recognize you. Well, uh, we'd like to take a look around your operation if you don't mind. Yes, well, I'm sorry, sir you'll have to give Mr. Truscott's OK on that. Well, you'll tell him we stopped by. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, that was a hell of a speech you gave to Annie while ago about the day of reckoning and all that. It was great. Just one thing, how do you keep a straight face when you're doing it? I'm afraid I don't get your meaning. I mean, you know, with the wall down, it must be pretty hard to keep membership up. It sounds like to me doomsday is cancelled. Don't you what's the news, mister? Why, we've got Libyan terrorists killing innocent people right here in our own backyard. And what do you think is going to happen when Gaddafi gets his hands on the button? He will. Make no mistake about that. The United States has no shortage of enemies. I don't need to tell anybody anything. Why, these folks want to be ready when the time comes on the day of reckoning. They'll will be delivering a powerful blow for the Lord. Well, amen, brother, praise God. Keep up the good work. I bet sometimes you must feel like the hand of God. I think you better get your liberal ass right on off of this property. Liberal ass. I have a liberal ass. Let's go, detective. I get that, the ass. Well, that settles it. I'm going on a diet tomorrow. No more jelly donuts for me. I'm going to start exercising, start doing those butt crunches. Let's go, Detective. Thank you for setting me straight, sir. It was great. Toodaloo. Love you. God, you look cute in those GI Janes. Bye! DETECTIVE WEBBER: I swear that man wanted to shoot you on the spot. You were right though, no kooks in there. Just some good level-headed citizens with M-16s. OK, OK. Now, what's next? See if you can locate David Speer. I've got to run back to Dallas and have a meeting with the terrorists expert they're bringing in. You want me to come along? No, you better stick around here. See if you can locate David. - OK. And I'll talk to you when I get back. All right? Yeah. Later. You are aware of the tension this is creating in our office. Uh, here he is. Uh, gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Detective Farrow. Uh, Neil this is Fred Harkington, our terrorist expert. Harkonnen. Fred Harkonnen. - Harkonnen. - Nice to meet you. FRED: My pleasure. BURTON: And this is Rex Martin, an assistant from the DA's office. Perhaps you two have met before. I don't think so, How you doing? I've been bitter, frankly. It seems I have everyone from the White House on down to the mayor's office breathing down my neck. They want to know why it's suddenly open season on politicians here in Dallas. Well, now, you know that these attacks have not just taken place in Dallas. There have been a string of attacks all across the country. Senator Bagley and Congressman Seagram were boldly assassinated in the space of one week. Now, I want to know what you've come up with, and I'm sure the FBI would be interested too. Gentlemen, we've got to move on this thing and fast. Well, I'll be filing a report later on this afternoon with Captain Burton. Not good enough. Until this situation is under control, you will report directly to the district attorney's office, specifically, to me. Like hell he will. Who in the hell do you think you're talking to? Look, let me tell you something, Mark. I want you to go back there and tell your boss that I don't like him sending his little flunkie down here to put pressure on my department. I'll send my report up when I'm good and ready. And if your boss doesn't like that, you tell him to come down here in person and tell me about it. You understand? And until then, you get the hell out of my office, and I don't want to see you back here. Now, get the hell out. Move! Who the hell do you think you are? Things can get a little tense these days. Yeah. Oh, mind if I smoke? Go ahead. Oh, thanks. So what can you tell me about The Hand of God? Oh, my apologies, fellows. I'm sorry for the unprofessional outburst. No apology necessary. The parasite wouldn't come down here in an election year. Fred, why don't you go on and explain to the detective what you were telling me about these attacks. All right, first of all, these terrorists, at least the ones in the surveillance tape of Bagley's murder, not Libyans. So the Libyans are recruiting Americans to do their dirty work? I don't think so. In fact, I think the entire Libyan aspect of this scenario is wrong. What makes you think that? All right. What does this look like to you? A stick figure with a hand, the hand of God. As you know, Libya's a Muslim nation. And no Muslim group would ever use this particular icon for its trademark This is much more than a crude hand. This is a cross. The cross is a Christian symbol, and for that very reason, no Muslim group would ever touch it. Take a look. This is a quarter circle right here, you see, with the rays or fingers radiating from it. So it's actually a rising sun, the sign of the Son of God, Christ, or new day. I don't know, dawn of a new age. New day. Now, see, in my opinion, these acts of terrorism are being performed by a militant Christian group. And since blacks are traditionally not associated with these groups, I'm guessing that the black man video was a white man in disguise. He's no brother. See, this whole operation smacks the kind of white supremacist extreme Christian mentality you find in groups like the KKK. As for why these men have targeted Bagley and Seagram, I have no idea. This is strictly political. He's no brother. It's strictly political. I can't believe this. What? What? What the hell are you talking about? Follow me. Recognize anyone? Yeah, that's, uh, Senator Bagley. If I'm not mistaken, that's your Congressman Seagram. Anyone else? Look real close. My god, that's Truscott. These are really terrorists. How can you be sure? Bill told me. Bill Marshall? Farrow, you have a call coming in. It sounds important. This phone? Yes, line 2. Farrow here. You the one that was at the Hog Farm with the Sheriff's niece? Yeah, that was me. Well, I was out there too. You remember me? Randy Hamilton? Yeah, I remember you. I need to talk to, just you, and forget the Sheriff's niece, just you. You have some information regarding the truck? I know a shit load about a lot of things, enough to get me killed, all right? Well, can we talk? I can be back there in 2 and 1/2 hours. You just tell me where. Just wait for me at the motel. I'll get in touch with you, and you listen up, Sheriff Bigelow and Milo Truscott is real good buddies, you know, if you mention this to anybody in the Morgan County Sheriff's Department, all you are going to have is one dead Negro on your hands. You understand me? I got you. I'll be there alone. Good. I'm sending you help tomorrow. Yeah, what the hell is going on here? I'm beginning to worry about you a little bit. This is going to sound ridiculous. Do you believe in ESP? No, of course not. How about you? I think it's possible. Yeah. I think so too. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello, Detective Farrow here. Well, hello, Detective, this is Caroline. NEIL (ON PHONE): Hi. I have the night off. I thought maybe we could get together again. Yeah, I'd like that. I can't tonight. How about tomorrow? Yeah. Sure. No, really, I'd like to. It's just-- I've got some work I got to do tonight. You understand? I understand. It's just that-- NEIL (ON PHONE): What? Well, last night, last night was really special for me. I just hope it was special for you too. Special for me? it was real special. Well, then you'll change your mind. I wish I could. Some other time then. Great. [phone ringing] Hello. Where have you been? Yeah, I'll be out there. He said he was busy. He has work to do. Maybe you're losing your touch, Alexandra. If I know Mr. Farrow, there's only one thing that will give him more satisfaction than spending the night with me is finding the man who shot his partner and putting a bullet right between your eyes. - Milo, don't. - Oh, come on. Be a man. Later. What's wrong, big brother? Little Alex let you down? TRUSCOTT: You shut up. Maybe she isn't his type. Maybe you should have sent me. Whitney, fix me a drink. I don't know why you just didn't let me kill him in the first place. It would have been so easy. Why? And miss out on all the fun of killing another cop myself? I thought she said killing him was a bad idea. I did say that. What are you going to do? You'll see. You better not forget who you belong to, baby. You Hamilton? Just get in. Understand, Truscott owns this county. He can do whatever he wants. And whatever he's involved in, I guarantee you Sheriff Bigelow is ass deep into it too. What made you decide to come forward now? Tuesday morning when I found these in the sausage meat. Now, Milo had two boys working for him, Tracy Goodwin and Luke. Tuesday, they was gone. And don't nobody seem to know where they went. And I think they went on down to Dallas and got killed. I think somebody is going to be eating what's left of them in the breakfast sausage. See, Milo is a crazy son of a bitch. Now, I've done lived here all my life. As long as I can remember, Truscott ran Morgan County. Milo's daddy, he wasn't no saint, but he wasn't crazy neither. Now, a while back, Milo's uncle turned up dead. And nobody really give a damn. They didn't even go after the killer, because he was an embarrassment to the family. He was a homosexual. Now, rumor was that him and Milo had a thing going. Milo got mad at him one night, killed him, and his dad had covered it up. Take a look at that picture? You seen it before? Yeah, Milo had one of these over the top of his fireplace. You recognize any of the men? That's the congressman. That's Mr. Bagley. He used to come out to the house a lot a long time ago. And I seen this man before, but I don't recollect his name right now and Milo, And that's Norman Pritchard. Everybody know he run the Klan hereby. KKK? Whatever they call themselves these days. Same old dumb shit, kill all the niggers, kill all the Jews. Dumb motherfucker. Yeah. What about David Speer? Everybody but you know he hang down around Norma's. Norma's? A trucker joint outside of town, Highway 61. If you go down there messing with them boys, you be careful. They'll cut your balls off just as soon as look at you. [music playing] So how you guys doing? I was looking for David Speer. Have you seen him? Yeah, just going around the corner of the building there. You'll find him out back on the porch sleeping it off. Thanks. Oh, don't mention it. No problem. Mr. Speer. Mr. Speer, wake up. TRUSCOTT: That old boy put a nice goose egg on your noggin, didn't he? I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to wake up. You've been out cold for almost 24 hours. I thought maybe you'd gone into a coma like that nigger buddy of yours, the one I took down in the warehouse. Son of a bitch. I've been called worse. Oh, I bet you have. What is it with you, Truscott? I've been trying to figure you out. I mean, you're a powerful man. What the hell have you got to gain from all this? If you knew me better, Detective Farrow, you'd know I'd never do anything without a reason. What reason? I know you're a bigot. But why kill Senatory Bagley and Congressman Seagram? Why are you blaming this on the Libyans? Seagram's and Bagley were traitors. They were once members of our organization. I got them elected. Once they were in office, they forgot the promises they'd made. I gave them every opportunity to make good. Finally, I had to force the issue. Yeah, I saw your little group portrait from Bagley's office. Yeah, that pissed me off. Here he's ignored all of his duties, and still he's got the group picture proudly displayed on his desk. What exactly were Bagley and Seagram supposed to do for you? Oh, lots of little things. It would have been easier with her help, but plan B is coming along just fine. I suppose you heard about the Israeli ambassador stopping over in Dallas on his way to the big conference with the president. I imagine he's trying to gain support for his country since they're about that far from declaring war in Libya, thanks to me and my associates. Bravo. Thank you. Anyhow, not being one to ever leave anything to chance, I've decided to squash that little Israeli cockroach. Then his people have no choice but to go to war, and of course, the Americans will jump right in. And then what? Well, that completes phase 1. The entire operation is kind of long and involved, but basically, we'll start an all-out campaign to get the white folks in this country to see the so-called minorities in the proper light. Look at the LA riots. Already people are starting to see things our way. A few more properly staged events of that caliber in the taxpaying, God-fearing backbone of this nation, folks like you and me son, who've been paying the bills, will wake up and realize it's time to ship the niggers back to Africa. Let them take the place of all the damn Libyans the Israelis are going to exterminate. Oh, by the way, my boy Clint has been using your vehicle. I hope you don't mind. BURTON: Don't you think I know that the Israeli ambassador is going to be here? Of course I stepped up security at the convention center. Will you get off my case? Goodbye! Where the hell are you, Neil? Where the hell are you? So? So what? Who's better? Milo, give it a rest, please. I want to hear it. Who's the best? You are. I don't think I like your tone, missy. Maybe you're starting to forget who you are and where you came from. I remember, Milo, please. Who found you? You did. Where? In the gutter with all the other street trash. Who brought you salvation? You did. And who's going to make you the queen of the South before it's all said and done? I asked you a question. Dammit, Alex, it's a damn cop, isn't it? How ridiculous. Sheriff. Milo, how are you? Good to see you again. Who do you know, Clint? How you doing, [inaudible]? Come on in here. Milo, I've got to hand it to you. Everything has gone just like you said it would. I commend you. Thank you, Sheriff. Clint, Whitney, I envy you two boys. Wish I was going with you. Whitney volunteered to carry the bomb. I'm real proud of him. Is that Dallas detective behaving himself. TRUSCOTT: He's been the perfect guest. SHERIFF: Where's that pretty little Alex? She ought to be here celebrating with us. Alex is a little under the weather. SHERIFF: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You remember to give her my regards. [music playing] [phone ring] Yes? This is Burton. Yeah, uh, this is Randy Hamilton. BURTON: Who? Randy Hamilton, Morgan County. I'm calling about that detective that you sent down here. Neil Farrow? Yeah, what about him? RANDY (ON PHONE): I think the boy done got himself into some mighty deep shit down here. Good luck. Milo, Milo, please, don't make me do this. Clint, keep an eye on Whitney so he doesn't embarrass himself. Yes, sir. And Whitney, you be real gentle with that bomb, you hear? We wouldn't want it to go off prematurely. [music playing] Hang in there buddy. I'm watching over you. How am I supposed to get out of this? Keep your eyes open. I'm watching your back. WHITNEY: God, this place is crawling with security. We have to abort. Shut up, you chicken shit. You do anything to jeopardize this mission I'll fucking kill you. Do you understand me? Gentlemen, this is a restricted area. You need to back out. Dallas PD, special passport. We're going to help protect the ambassador. Can I see your ID? Sure thing. Hi there. Comfortable? Great. I just love being tied up. Maybe I could make you a little more comfortable. I told them they should have sent me instead of Alex. Alex? Oh, that's right. You know her as Caroline. You didn't realize she was my mother's mistress, did you? That's all right. You won't even remember Alex when I get through with you.
