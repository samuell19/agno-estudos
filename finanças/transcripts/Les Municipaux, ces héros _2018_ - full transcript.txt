We are in the Champions League of the best equipped cities. Port-Vendres is equipped with exceptional equipment. Parking for cars, port for boats. It is a site teeming with projects. An ice rink, an Olympic stadium, a convention center, a zenith and an airport are planned. Port-Vendres will be the megalopolis of 2020. 5,883 inhabitants, protected by 588 municipal employees, competent, available and creative. -She works alone. You invented the remote control. -We can say it. -But you're cutting a job. Syndically, this is debatable. -No, it will always take types to operate the machines. And sharp guys. -Who are the sharp guys? -It's us ! They laugh. Groovy music -Oh fuck ! Leaves and rakes It's the song of the municipal Leaves and rakes It's almost aperitif time -Mr. the Mayor, the situation is catastrophic. 20 million euros is too much. Too much equipment, personnel, vehicles. -The General Council no longer wants to pay. -Not the Regional Council. -Not the state. -Even Brussels does not want to pay anymore. -Even Brussels? Are you sure? - As far as we are concerned, we are already on the march. -We give you two weeks to find resources. -Or we declare the city bankrupt. Phone ring -What else, Ménard? -Teddy bear, it's me. You hear me ? What are you doing ? -But... But I... It is a mistake, madam! -But answer, Teddy! -Stop, honey! -Warning ! Asshole! -But darling... Where you go ? Hold on ! Why did you pound? -I thought someone was crossing. -We stack when we know! -It's beautiful, as a sentence. -I cannot make any observation. -Is that so ? I am mayor of Port-Vendres. Robert Baldelli. -And? -And I... What do you want ? Come on, move on! And I have more points on my license. No observation, as I do not drive. -You were driving! -He didn't understand. I'm mayor and I don't have a permit. Put yourself in my place. -And I have more car and no job. -I have a proposition for you. I'm hiring you in the city and we forget that. -I don't know how to do anything. -That's what we're looking for. -Municipal employee! My Gilbert, what pride! I didn't know you applied. -Neither do I. Finally, it was a surprise. Look, mom. He is new. I caught him in the harbor. -You hung out in Port-Vendres again! So you applied and what did they take you for? -For everything, for nothing. That's good, I don't know how to do anything. So I can do everything. I feel worried. -But no. I'm happy. Happy but worried. It's Port-Vendres. -It is next, 4 km. -These people are different. There have been stories between Collioure and Port-Vendres. -Which ones? -Ah... It can't be said. It is known, but it cannot be said. -Thierry! -I have your Ricard du Perthus. - Something serious is going on. Stop training. - Guys, break. And a Ricard only. Cries of discontent -You want to win? -YES ! -You want to win? -YES ! -So think dietary! -HEIN? -Put that in your face. - Something bad happened. Comrades, the new sweeper fell in the harbor, unfortunately. -It's crazy ! How it happened ? - Unfortunately. It cannot be explained. - Unfortunately. There's nothing we can do about it. -Finally, a sweeper in the port... - Unfortunately. There's nothing we can do about it. Is that clear ? -It's clear. -Yes it's clear. -It's clear. -Return to preventively the reaction of the town hall. -Why preventively? -The town hall hasn't said anything yet, so let's act. -But she said nothing. -Where are you from? You want to fuck an emerging movement? That's it ? - Are you looking to fuck? - Let's vote to see if we don't do anything. Who wants us to do nothing? Unanimously, let's do nothing. Vero? - Fortunately we took the time to talk to each other. Otherwise, we would have done nothing. -Thank you, Vero. Everyone signed the petition for Whit Tuesday? -YES. -End of meeting. Stop, with this whistle. Thierry, you're painful. -Say, Vero, you have red eyes. -They test the chlorine dosage at the swimming pool. -And in the ass, is it moving? -Shut up. -Girls, come and see. From Monday May 7 to Wednesday May 9, I take 2 RTTs. I arrive at the Ascension. There, I declare my mother sick on Friday. Hop, I'm coming to Pentecost Monday. I resume work on Tuesday. I took two days, I had 11. -Putain! -Eh yes. -Me, I arrive at thirteen. I add two days of linden allergy. -Do you know your dates in advance? -Of course. I ask them a year before. -But you have an advantage. Your parents were municipal employees. -His grandparents too. It's a whole culture. -It's a family thing. It gives you a head start. -It's okay ? I do not disturb ? 18.1 coffees per person per day. Here, we drink 18.1 coffees per day per person. So I want an answer. Where are the Nespresso capsules? We don't blow. We have respect for his hierarchy. I'm going to cut you off. Budget cuts. Terminado. The disappearing toilet paper. I will count everything. How many sheets for normal use? 6, 7? On a roll, it's 7 x 15 cm, I round to 1 m per person, 20 days, one roll, 4 people, 4 rolls per month. It will become a scientist. I ask the question again. What do you do with Nespresso capsules? I will not move from here. -Menard, are you coming? - I'm coming, Mr. Mayor! Yeah... -On that, I go to the toilet. -Take your meter. -You called me ? -Yes, Ménard. I hired a new employee, Gilbert Lavergne. -We said it was over, hire them. I say that for the general interest. -It's good for the general interest. He has a unique CV. He will be looked after by Christian Garcia. -Christian Garcia? Want to sink the city? His latest feat, the sweeper at the bottom of the harbor. -The investigation is underway, we don't know. -It will not succeed because Garcia is a union representative. -You see evil everywhere. Thank you, Ménard. -So ? -It's good, but you mow the same thing three times. -It's certain. Otherwise, there is that. -That's good. You make the surface. However, you only have one guy who works. And you have two watching, plus the reserve team. We will be cut jobs. Is that what you want ? -Oh no. -So ? There, I don't have time. We talk about it at the aperitif. I come around 11am. -OK. -10.30am. -It works. -You are on Municipal FM. Here's a song for Brigitte, who will recognize himself. -It pisses, Jean-Mi, with his Brigitte! Always whining! It's not true. Here ! Rock music ... Come on, the portal. He works in the city, too. He should unionize. Yes, it is the material that breaks the rhythm. ... And There you go ! At work ! Here we go again. And There you go. -Hello. Gilbert Lavergne, I'm the new one. Am I bothering you. Are you fishing? -No, I'm concentrating on organizing the schedule. I focus, I do the planning. Gilbert Lavergne, new. Get to know me, we're on the left. -I'm having a hard time doing it. - tu or be on the left? - tu. -I prefer. Let me introduce myself, Christian Garcia. I run the whole shop. I'm running the bouzingue. - Low hat. Alone ? - You just have to catch the rhythm. We are gradually becoming machines. Gilbert Lavergne. So where are you from? -Collioure. -You won't say that. -It is a problem ? -There were stories. It is known, but it is not said. Tell me about your curriculum. How did you get there? -I wanted to be a fighter pilot, but I only had 7/10 in the right eye. At this speed, it does not forgive. You're targeting Cahors, you're farting Limoges. -You are a champion, you. Have you studied, have you been far? -Up to Perpignan. -Perpignan. - Patent level. But I didn't pass it. The teacher said: "No need to pass it, we know the result." And when we know the result, we are less motivated. -But, you're really a champion. Crash It's Michel, don't worry, he must have forgotten something. -I was like, "It will pass." All right, but it happened. I couldn't have passed. But I passed. And I did not touch! I could have touched. But I didn't touch it. On the other hand, the portal works. Everything works. Wood, iron, concrete. Everything works. Absolutely everything. Wood, iron, concrete. Everything works. - Only you who resist. -Who is he ? -Gilbert Lavergne, the new one. -The mayor... -HELL! Are you sick or what? We do not say so. A city employee doesn't say that. Never ! -Never. -A municipal employee says that he returned on file. -On file. How did you get in, my boy? -On file? -You see when you want. -I hope that I will be a good municipal employee. -Perhaps, but it's work. A municipal employee has his particularity. Go ahead, walk. -Me ? -Yes normal. You walk. You walk down the street, come on! I'll stop you, Gilbert. No, a municipal employee, he has concerns. He has the weight of responsibilities on his shoulders. Take this broom and walk. You're worried, you're concerned. Go ahead, walk. -He has concerns. -He is concerned. -He has responsibilities. He is concerned. -Looked. -It's good. -He is not good, Gilbert? -Very. Ah, it reminds me of Zidane. His first match in the French team. It's his first game and already we know what will become of him. A champion. -He is a champion. -I can walk more slowly. -No, you're thirty years old to learn to walk slowly. -Thirty years, my rabbit. -Thirty years. In any case, you are starting well. -I have to pick up the kids. I can't be late. Here, Christian. This is my new "mogito" recipe. Wrestling mogito. -Don't we say "morito"? -Ah no, we say "mogito". Do we say "la reunesse et les sports"? -We say "reunesse and sports"? -No. -Or well "the 1st ranvier"? -We don't say "ranvier". -Or well "the call of the 18th ruin"? - Does it say "the call of the 18th ruin"? -So it's mogito. -So, how do we say? -Mogito? -It's good. -You see when you want. - Come on, I'm going. -Gilbert, I'm showing you your new outfit. You think there is an outfit. And then we try the "talkie-valkies". -Mr. the Mayor, I think I have found a solution. Sign this unique proposition tuna farm, to save the city. I say that for the general interest. -Never ! I will never be the gravedigger of Port-Vendres. Something else ? -Yes. This year, the Association of Mayors of France meets in Miami. -Oh, Miami... I have just returned from Seychelles, from the seminar of the general councilors. Let me recover. -We can't ignore it. -Good, go to Miami. But they will end up killing us, with all these trips. -Here it is. Hello, Milene. -Hello ! -It's okay ? -I am a little late. -46 minutes. And... thirty seconds! -45 minutes is nothing. Fortunately, the Mayor did not see you. -He would have summoned her face to face. -To spank her well. -That can be nice, a spanking of Teddy bears. - "Oh you! Oh Milene! "You were ugly, Milene!" - "Oh yes, Teddy, "it's good, spanking, my buttocks are all red." -She has breasts that point. -Sorry. -What's the matter ? And the sign there? "Wait behind the privacy line." It's French, "behind". -Is it French or not? -He does not reply and he goes behind. -Yes sir ? -It's for an identity card. -I don't hear, you're too far away. - Articulate, we are not machines. -That is why ? -An identity card. -Ah. It's not me, it's Béné. I will see if it is there. Go behind, please. It's confidential. Telephone ringtone -The town hall, hello! - Drop it, it's me. Blessed, are you there? -Yes that's why ? -An identity card ? -Yes. -Are you sure ? -Sure. -You have to be sure. Béné, it's for an identity card. -An identity card ? Ah yes but no, there. The problem is that at quarter past twelve, I'm not attacking a file. Tomorrow is good. -Are there no medical examination? -Oh yes ! -Otherwise, I see that Monday. Tuesday, to be safer? -Come back Tuesday. Thank you sir. Moans of pleasure Oh you, just you! -Oh, Teddy! Teddy bear, why do you love me? -I love you for your intelligence. -It's the first time I've been told that. Telephone ringtone Horn concert -Stop honking! Can't you see we're working? -What exactly are we doing here? -We work, we count the felled palm trees. -Why not count them by slaughtering them? -It's not the same service, not the same skills. There are those who slaughter and those who count. -I knew a good hare hunter who couldn't count them. -You see ? Horns It's over, yes? I'll calm them down for you! Can't you see we're disabled? And we are two? I'll give it to you to go shopping. Introduction to walkie-talkie. -Great. -Go. Ah shit. -What? -Can not. -Why ? -It is 11:50 a.m. -So what ? -At the town hall, each hour started is considered finished. 11.50 am, it is already noon. - Do we ever go past noon? -We would be in overtime and it would be expensive for the community. And who is it ? They are the community. -Bouge your car! -Shut your mouth ! Go back to the private, if you're not happy. -We save you money. -He doesn't see it. Go to the canteen. -Where is she ? -To the beach. It is a social achievement. If we eat more than 3 km from the base, we have a premium of ten euros. -You're always on the go, whatever. -We can't do anything if the beach is 3 km away. -I don't wear the belt? -No, we're in town, we don't care. Groovy music ... Leaves and rakes It's the song of the municipal Leaves and rakes It's almost aperitif time ... -So... -Wow! What is that ? -The first aid kit. Ricard, crisps, olives. The trilogy. If we are ever planted. -Oh yeah. -Say, what are you sucking? -A peach core. -And why ? -To quit smoking. -Do you quit smoking when you suck on a peach kernel? -Since I suck it, I don't smoke. -Are you smoking before? -No. -Hey ! I bring the new one. -Hello, the new one. Welcome ! - This one, on the right, is my wife. And the other is Vero. -Hello, I'm Gislaine. Enchanted, Gilbert. -Hello. Speedwell. I have red eyes, it's chlorine. -She works at the pool, but she's hot on the skimmer. Ah, and that is Maurice. Hello, Maurice! -12.43 m from the barbecue to the sand. -It only counts. He was a soccer referee and one day he took the ball in the head. Since then, he counts. -Mauritius! And there? From stick to barbecue. How much is there? -I recount. - That's it, recount.

There, happy birthday. -Thank you. -Uh... That's all ? Ah yes. Vero, this year, we decided to change everything. Usually, we were giving you a gift. Here we have changed. -Yes. The gift, politically, is questionable. The consumer society... And tutti truffi... -Imperialism. -Imperialism. Fascism. -Who hugs us. Here. -Here. -We therefore decided to subscribe and give you the money so you can choose your gift yourself. -Yes, you can buy something you like. -And if you choose something you like, you have a choice. -When we have a choice, we choose. -Not better. -I give him the money? Clinking of a few coins Here. Go to the table! Crash This is Michel! So, does anyone have Ricard? -YES ! -And water ? -NO. -Thank you anyway. -Hey guys ! Was there this sign "No picnic"? -Well yeah, he's always been there. -But no, he was not there. -Of course, of course. - "No picnic", he was not there. -BUT IF ! That's why we come for a picnic. Moans of pleasure -Hey, Teddy, if the others arrived? -No but it is 2 p.m., there is no risk. I know my teams. Groovy music ... -Jean-Mi, I have the keys, it's locked. You can neither go up nor go down. -Jean-Michel, come! You are not going to be in the photo. -We take a photo for the birthday in Vero. -Hey, Jean-Mi! By the way, what do you have? Do you have an "ai-phone" or an iPhone? -I dunno. -Well look! -It's an iPhone with an "i". -This is not the same. IPhone, you take photos up, a phone, you take horizontal photos. -He believes in it. Laughs So, are you taking your photo? -You are done. Get me down from there. I'm not afraid, but it's high. Okay, is he getting me down, the alcohol? - "Alcohol"... We don't know who you're talking to. -The other one, there. -Is you talking about me? -Bring me down. -Is I the alcoholic? -We have the keys and therefore the power. What right behavior! - Me, a guy from the right? -You yes ! -Me ? Repeat that I'm right! -You're a facho, you! -Look at the facho. Do you see the keys? Look at them well! -Wait, Michel! -You will see if I am a facho! You will remember. -I said you were angry. ... -The number of caps! -My favorite is this one. -Stopped ! -What? I'm explaining to Gilbert. I put it on to annoy Ménard and the mayor. -He's stupid, Michel. Throw the keys in the water! -He is sick. On the other hand, Véro, his gift at 8.20 euros... She looked very happy. -She was very happy. Must say that we put the package. -And then you, your phone, are you ever going to let go -I cultivate myself. I'm on Google. That's good, Google. We can know everything. For example, a Picasso painting. If you want to know who he is, they tell you. -Oh yes anyway. ... -What's all this for, Christian? -I am refueling at home. Mower, chainsaw, outboard. -On the account of the town hall? -But yes of course ! ... -And there you go, a pizza. -On the account of the town hall? -Yes, as usual. -71 euros, for the town hall. I take this, and I take this For the town hall, as usual -Yes, for the town hall. Is that your money, do you mind? We wonder who you vote for. -For the town hall. -It's new. -He learns quickly. -He learns nothing, he knows everything. It's Mozart. Go, Gislaine, to work! It is 3 p.m. -Take this. -Hey, Christian! A gas bottle for the house? -Is it not brilliant, the Gilbert? This Gilbert! By cons, the pump attendant, it starts to inflate me. I wonder if he votes on the left. -Trend center. -It's serious ? -It can become. -It can become. -It can become. -Gilbert, hurry up! We have nothing to do, but don't be late. So Gilbert, here we are in the heart of the reactor. -Wow, it smacks! What is this big painting? -The workforce planning. Red cards, it is the long-term absent. Orange cards, absent mid-term. And the yellow cards, we don't know for how long. And the green ones... - Those who work. -Finally, those who are there. -You can't imagine. -At a glance, you see all the work that cannot be done. -And it's a job to see the job that will not be done. -I show you the rest. You don't eat chewing gum! -It's the town hall that pays. -Now, the rest. Diego! Honk -Ah, hi, guys. I was listening to the engine. -It's off. -That's what's crazy. Even when turned off, it makes noise. -You realize ? It's sharp. Even when turned off, it makes noise. -It's not kidding. -Ah yes. Diego worked in Formula 1. -In Perpignan. Formula 1 next to the ring road. -That remains of Formula 1. And now, the rest of the visit. All this was paid for by the local authorities, local authorities. General Council, Regional Council, the town hall, the Community of communes, the Ministry of Agriculture, Europe. They all donated money. -And there, what is it? -No, there is nothing. It is known, but it is not said. -There was something. -We had a mini-sweeper. We parked it there. Unfortunately, she had an accident. Chewing gum. Come on, it's no use. -What happened ? -We told you we don't talk about it. You're going back to a family. There are secrets in a family. Secrets of... -Pichichelle? - Family secrets! -I knew it, too. - Following the visit. Indebted for several generations, of several million... The machine that is under this tarpaulin, you wouldn't have even imagined it. In a few moments will appear before your eyes the machine that will make Port-Vendres the most indebted municipality in the region and maybe from France. I say Top Machine... Top Debt! So ? -A snow plow? -A snow plow! -But it never snows, in Port-Vendres. -It's true, it never snows. But the day it's going to snow, we're going to fuck them all. The other municipalities will tell us: "You have a snow plow. Do you lend it to us?" "No, we can't. It's our snow plow!" Banyuls: "We can't." Argelès: "We can't." Narbonne, perhaps. "Ah no, we can't." And there may even be these people from Collioure who will come and who will tell us: "We would like to have the snowplow." "No no ! "We're getting started. Stay with your snow, Collioure." And we will enjoy ourselves. We will be on snow-cleared roads that do not slip, with snowdrifts 4 meters high. We will be fine! We will be fine, damn! Excuse me. I get carried away, sometimes. I'm passionate, you see. But despite that, you will see that we will be criticized. And maybe even insulted. The municipal employee insulted. The most frequent insult is: "Lazy!" We don't know where it came from. You must not answer it. You have to look far, look elsewhere. We say it. The municipal employee, he looks away. He has the look of a dog shitting. He looks away. -It's true, yes. -Do it, you'll see. You do it well, the dog that shits. Honk But who is this idiot who honks? They are painful! -The code. Do you have the code? -The ? -The code. -Ah yes. It is still a war date. -What one today? -1664. -Not know. -The beer war. -Very funny. Are you the new one? -Yes, nice to meet you. -No time. I ran all morning. Will have to bring me the papers at the town hall. Can't you open from the inside? -Ah yes, Mr. Ménard, we could have, by pressing the open button. -So what ? -At the town hall, they wanted to give me the right to open, without compensation. Without compensation, no cover. If there is a glitch, I take it. And I don't want to. And the porter's premium, where do I put it? -I have an idea. - Immediately, the insults. This is Ménard, the director of technical services for the town hall. A "eunurch". -What is a "eunurch"? A guy who did the ENA and who is eunuch. In addition, he is from Paris. -Paris-center? -Center. - Damn, it's scary. -Good. What an emotion, to be surrounded by such beautiful women. Coffee ? Ménard, five coffees. -If there are any left. Ms. Garcia, this dress is beautiful. These little beasts that swim. -These are water lilies. -You, Milene, it's perfect. Good. Each year, there is the seminar of the Association of Mayors of France. Last year, Yolande accompanied me to Vierzon for a basketball safety seminar at school. It was very interesting. Isn't it, Yolande? -Very, Mr. Mayor. It was decided to put goals in hand. -Because ? -It's lower. -Eh yes. This year, the debate focuses on school canteens. It's going to be exciting. The only problem is the destination. Miami. It's chaos. 40 ° C, the sea, palm trees. The horror. So I asked Mr. Ménard to organize a draw. Ménard, the jar! In this jar, there are four papers with the first name of each. I get one. If I may say. Here. I will then draw the replacement by lot in the event of imponderable. And the winner is... Gislaine Garcia! -But no ! -Well, well done! -Thank you, Mr. Mayor! Thank you. -Well done ! -Thank you. I am so happy. -And the replacement... I don't need to say it. I keep it in case. Here, Menard, take care of it. -Darling. Christian. Christian! Soft music -What's the matter ? -What ? -But what ? You never want to make love and there you do not warn. Why today? -To celebrate my departure to Miami. -For ? -To celebrate my departure to Miami. -Tomorrow, we'll see, Miami. You're painful. -Without regret ? We are closing. He's snoring. ... - There you go, Mrs. Garcia. 1.20 euro. -Here. -Lisa, stop chewing. What are you giving back to Mrs. Garcia? -Money. -"Money". God damn it piss me off. How much do you give to Mrs. Garcia? 5 euros minus 1.20 euro, that does? - 1.80 euro? -No. Come on, get out of there. And stop chewing! With all the trouble we give ourselves for them. As much with his brother, it was easy, he was brilliant. Do you know that he finished at Brevet + 2? -Ah that's good ! That makes Bac -1. -If you want, yes. But with it, nothing is simple. His latest find: "Mum, I want to look gothic." I said to him, "First, be good in English and Spanish. "Gothic, we'll sign you up next year." -Of course. -In any case, you look very fit. -Yes, I'm going to a seminar with the Mayor. -Houlà! -At Miami ! -Mayamaï. Americans say it like that. My sister was there. If you say Miami, they won't understand. -Very well, I will say Mayamaï. -You will see, life there is very expensive. But at the same time, for you, everything is paid. -Of course, everything is taken care of. Are we not working enough? -Ah, Gilbert! Are you coming now? Did you see the time? -Sorry, I didn't even have time for breakfast. -You can't work on an empty stomach. Have a glass of white. The C.E. does it for us at 1 euro per cubi. -1 euro per cubi! -It's white coming from Indre. It has a special feature. Taste it, you will tell me. -If they stop making wine. -You've seen, it's a wine that changes your voice. You're right, I was preparing a ballet with the municipal employees. A great musical ballet. -Why ? -For art. I have no choice. It gets you up, an urge for art and you have no choice, you do it. -I have a cousin who painted the Rodez calf market, and we asked her nothing. -It's art. You're going to turn on the music on the car radio. -You give me the top. - Me, I enrich the music on the megaphone. Everybody is ready ? Are you ready, everyone? We give it a try. Gilbert, are you ready? Press Play. Play! Waltz ("The Beautiful Blue Danube") ... He adds a shrill sound to the megaphone. ... Go on, go on! ... -It's beautiful. -For once we are not in the special effects. And all without kneeling. -No oral services. - Do girls who sleep with their boss really exist? -I do not believe. -Neither do I. -Are you okay with the king prawns? How is your day ? Do Nespresso capsules work well? I will corner you! For the interest... -GENERAL! Milene is still crying. Ménard imitates him. -Robert, we do as we said, we put you two places Deliveries. -Ah no, a Deliveries, a Taxis and a Disabled. -You have two cars. -It's for my daughter. -She's 11 years old. -She will have the license one day. - Do we agree that it's just a small gift? You see when you want. And obviously... -Of course. - By the way, here's the new one, Gilbert. Well, say something, Gilbert. -The new one doesn't eat meat? -He learns quickly. -It's the Zizou of the town hall. You take the ball out of the trunk, he is champion of Spain. He blows. -22 million deficit, Ménard. We have to find a solution. -You know it: Chinese tuna. -Ah no, no. I can't do it. And not a word of it to my wife. She is very worried. - There is little chance, we never see it. -I know, I tell him. "You have to open up, you have to air yourself. "Let’s run." -It's good to run. -You run often. Take her. -Why not. In all honor. -Yes, of course! Who do you think you are? Romantic song ("Ti Amo") ... -A song dedicated to Brigitte, who will recognize himself. -You piss off, Jean-Mi, with your Brigitte. "She will recognize herself." She won't come back! It's his wife, Brigitte. She left six years ago, he says she's taking a break. She won't come back. -Mine also took a break. -But not six! -No. Seven. -Yes, but it's less serious, seven. Seven is good luck. It is said: Seven years... ... of happiness. Uh... So... I explain the principle to you. When it's red, you're on the air. When it's off, you're not on the air. There, you cannot speak... There, you cannot speak and there, yes. On, off. Okay, let's go! And now, we are going to welcome a very interesting guest today. It’s Gilbert Lavergne, the new municipal employee! -Hello ! Its shrill -Jean-Mi, don't flush! We could have been on the air. Well, there we were. On air. It is painful. - Sorry, I had to go. - "I had to go". -Will need paper. -And give a door, please. -Yes, two things. -And we resume the course of our broadcasts! Gilbert, how does one become a municipal employee? -It's like a shock. Like a vehicle coming in from behind. We do not feel it coming and pam! -No? -No. -Second question, which comes to my lips. How you see the future, how you see yourself evolving in the profession? -Me, I hope to work more to earn more. Have more money to buy me a house. I went to the bank and they said to me: "You have a job, we just let go." We opened a Codevi, a PAP, a PEP, a home savings account, and a credit to pay all my credits. -Are you stupid? Did you see where you are? You speak only of cash! On progressive radio. Unionist! -Sorry. -You kidding. And we will continue with an advertising page. Top, Jean-Mi! - "A desire for flowers?" -Put this rhythm. - "Something to celebrate? "Engagement, marriage... "Buy your flowers at Cindy Fleurs! "Cindy Flowers, "I buy my flowers there." -Thank you, Jean-Mi, for raising the mood in the studio! Now let's continue with our weather page and our specialist, Jean-Luc. I'm calling Jean-Luc! Welcome, Jean-Luc! (He changes his voice) Hello! Welcome to my weather section. Today in Port-Vendres, clouds and thunderstorms, which will give us a mid-fig day, half-grape. Half sun, half cloud. (With his normal voice) We continue with great news, Gilbert, that you may not know. The French petanque championship of municipal employees will be held in Port-Vendres from April 18, 2018 to April 19... 2019! And then a next news, which will be said by Gilbert! Come on, Gilbert. It fits here. Just go. Yes, there it is. - "The training games will be counted in working hours. "Another social achievement "which will soon be engraved in the history of unionism... "municipal." -Thank you, Gilbert! (Whispers) You did very well. Thank you, Gilbert! And we will continue with a second important news. It just fell on our tickers. Gislaine Garcia has just been appointed to support the Mayor in a seminar in Miami. Bravo Gislaine, who will recognize himself! And Gilbert, the rest of the newspaper! - "The great paella of May 1st will take place at the Krasucki space "May, the 1st." -What is a good date for May 1st. And I will continue by reminding our listeners to remember to register in order to sign the petition so that we finally get Ascension Friday! We will continue with an advertising page. Top, advertising! Jean-Mi, it's yours. (In a dreary voice) - "The Lion d'Argent hotel, "the hotel where people go. "A weekend in Port-Vendres, a weekend for two, "a romantic weekend." We listen to ourselves right away: "These white roses, I'm going to see mom". -You piss off, Jean-Mi. -This hotel, the Silver Lion, was it not the Golden Lion? -If, but they lost a star. -I'm tired sometimes. "The White Roses" (Berthe Sylva) ... -HE IS REALLY... IT IS REALLY PHENOMENAL! -Say, Jean-Mi, he charged. -It's not yesterday, he burned out. -A ? -A burn out is English. Didn't you do English? -No. I did spanish. My mother said it would be used to buy Ricard au Perthus. There, everything works in English. Must follow. "On, Off". "Burn out", how to translate it? "Burn", I have the impression and "out", that things are not going well. -Hey, Christian! -Shit. Hi, Jean-Louis. So there, I present Rémi to you. The artist I told you about. -It's true, you told me about it. -The star on the left for the next five years. -Hurry up. -Do you know Leonard Cohen? -But yes. -Well it's better. It's finer, more written, and then Leonard Cohen did several things. When you make books, records, you get lost. He is at RMI, so he does that. -What? -He sings. -It's good. -No wait. There he is 48 years old and ready. -He looks ready, yes. - Go ahead, play a piece of the "Coffee machine". -Only one end. -You'll see. -They moved the coffee machine Without a word, without a letter -Whore. -And when we arrived In the hallway of the workshop, she was no longer there She was no longer there She was no longer there She was no longer there -And we are no longer there. - Are you taking it for May 1st? -I don't know. -Aznavour, at the start, nobody wanted it. - Don't shit with Aznavour. And the conditions are not met. There is no black, there is no light. Tell him to get out of here or I'll crush him, your Leonard Cohen. Leonard Cohen, my ass! -She was no longer there! -Go away ! Move over, Leonard Cohen! Go away ! Get out of there! - Are you taking it for May 1st? -25, 26, 27... Come on! 28... 39, 40, 41, 42... I've seen you before. 54, 55... What they are, these buses. All these little rabbits! -HE IS REALLY... IT IS REALLY PHENOMENAL! -Gislaine! You realize ? The government wants to question the counting of RTTs. If we don't mobilize, one day they will count the hours for us. -Figure that we don't say Miami, we say "Mayamaï". Mayamaï, the city of sea, sun and sex. -I'm exhausted, me. -The real party, what. -Ah, ladies, ladies. Ladies! How lucky to have these four beautiful women as collaborators. But let's stop dreaming. Business is business. As you know, Gislaine brilliantly won the draw for Miami. -Mayamaï, Mr. President... Mr. Mayor. They say Mayamaï. -Only, I received an email from the Administrative Inspectorate. Brussels sends us an audit on April 27. Pile during the Miami period. I called, tried to request a postponement, But it's not possible. We are not negotiating with Brussels. You are the specialist in European funds, Gislaine. You will have to support Ménard. -But finally, Mr. Mayor! -I'm sorry, it's a heartbreaker. But I have to do it. Ménard, who was the substitute? -Milène Lelong, the Mayor. -Is that so ? Is that so ? Are you sure ? -The truth comes out of the jar. -Ah yes ? It's not my memory. Yes, Ménard? Okay, if you say so. Welcome to Miami, Milène. -Thank you! -You are bilingual! -It's too much for me. -I'm sorry, Gislaine. -Add Ricard, it is light. Think "one for one". A glass of water, a liter of Ricard. That's it. -So ? -What gives? -This is good. -Go, to ours! -40, 41, 42... 6.43 meters! From the fountain to here, 6.43 m! -You piss off, Maurice, with your calculations. Get out of here, we're working. What it pisses me off! I'm no longer in the game. Go ahead, Gilbert, do it. -Me ? But I don't know how to play. -Go, Gilbert. Your ball must caress the gravel. Let her make love with the sand and there we go to the goal! -We go to the ? -We're getting to the point! Come on! -Christian. -What, Jean-Louis? -Will you think about it, for Rémi? -You are painful. Yes. But here we play. Get out. Come on, Gilbert. -With all that, I don't know who makes love to what. -Do not get into it too. Play. -I will do anything. -Go, let it flow. Hisses of admiration -She is beautiful ! -Is it too close? -When you want, you're good! It's your last ball, we're playing the game. The ball is worth three points. -I only have one ball. -Go! Are we there? Come on, Gilbert! Cellphone ringtone ("L'Internationale") Cries of admiration -Bravo, Gilbert! Hello? - Hello, it's me. Am I bothering you ? -Well no. You never bother me. But we work. -I'm not going to Miami anymore. This motherfucker got me out of Miami. You do not say anything ? Say something. -What do you want me to say ? Miami, Miami... You mean Mayamaï? -Mayamaï, Miami, nothing to do. In addition, he leaves with the most beautiful. -That, notice, it's... I want to say... No, but... Hello? Hello? -You ride ? -I can't, double-queue and have one parked in front of you. -It's up to you. -I made the necessary. Tomorrow they will paint you a big "Passage" just for you. Happy? -It's weird to be so close to power. So close. I was so scared, you know. -Oh, teddy bear! You saw, I fucked them well, with this hit of the double draw. -Teddy bear! -Teddy bear! Scared teddy bear not to go to America with your teddy bear. -It shouldn't be just physical, our relationships. -Our reports are frequent... And intelligent. I love you because you are intelligent. -It's the second time I've been told. Horns -It doesn't matter, Miami. Will you go another time, or I don't know... -Christian. You love Me ? -I have no choice. Of course I love you. Its shrill But what the hell is this? What is that ? It's not over, right? What is it now? -They moved the coffee machine Without a word, without a letter -What fada! -And when we arrived In the hallway of the workshop, she was no longer there! She was no longer there She was no longer there She was no longer there! -What is this mess ? -You wanted black and light. -It's 3 a.m. He stops there. -Give us the coffee machine In the corridor near the workshop -What is this tocard? -Jean Louis and his friend Rémi. He offers it to me for Union Day. -Store it for me. -Which is engraved... A neighbor shouts. -It's good, stop. So, did it slap you? -Yes, a slap. You're right ! -They put the coffee machine back -You mouth, with your guitar! -Here. He is silent, the little one. - Do you take it or not? -Yes, I take it from you! -Because it's good? -Yes. -Artistically? -Yes, that's it, artistically. But he closes his mouth. -Go, give everything. -They even added a chocolate machine For those who liked it -You mouth! For those who liked it! To you ! For those who liked it! -Shut up ! -For those who liked it For those who liked it! For those who liked it For those who liked it For those who liked it -And this one, do you like it? -I'm going to call the cops! -... who liked it -It's the only way. Otherwise, next month's wages will not be paid. -We will have seen it all. A tuna farm in Port-Vendres! Can you imagine the pollution? You know that a tuna rejects as much waste as a man? You see them, these poor tuna, in a cage, to go around in circles? They are sad, they are depressed, they are worried. And from anxiety to intestinal disorders, there is only one step. -Finally, it's 3 million rent a year, paid by the Chinese over five years. Three million euros. It's worth it to piss off. -No but Ménard! -Sorry. -It's nice to see an employee become municipal. Sounds like a butterfly. A butterfly emerging from... How do you say, already? -I dunno. Its shell, right? -Of its shell! No. Shell, right? -Perhaps. I have one of these worries. -Normal, it's your first time. Like Francis Cabrel before his first Olympia. -He knew the lyrics. -Look, you have the score. Write what is written and it will be fine. Houlà! I have nothing to do, but I still want to be on time. Here we go again ! Stop, stop! One day we will die there. Playful music -Well... There's just. -I am ashamed. Shame ! I prefer to leave, Ménard. I entrust the town hall to you. If you have time to take a look at my wife... ... Cellphone ringtone -Yes ? Yes, Nounoursette. I arrive ! IT IS REALLY PHENOMENAL! Are you okay, rabbits? -YES! -Hugo, come here! Breathe in the alcohol, we have to start. Breath, my rabbit! Strong! You see that we are not drunk! -YES! -Thank you, have a good trip. Thank you. Sir. Texting -Oh, damn! IT'S A DRINK -Oh, damn! -It can be seen only at his temper! -Oh fuck ! -Oh fuck. -Oh fuck. -Oh fuck ! Oh fuck ! -Oh shit ! Oh fuck ! Texting -Oh, damn! -Oh fuck ! -Oh fuck ! -Nickel, everything is perfect. Mermaids -Gilbert, what took you? -It exceeds? -Did you see what you wrote? -What's on paper. - "Passage. Attention, P. du maire." You had to write that "Passage". "P. du maire" is an annotation. -Y wrote "P. du maire". -It's an indication of the comrades. "Attention, P. du maire." What is "mayor's P." for you? - "Mayor's portal, mayor's passage." -Is it the mayor's house? -No. -So ? "P. of the mayor". Fuck but think! -But, I don't see! -But you found it. She's the mayor's whore. They tell you: "Be careful, you have to apply." And you write it. It's buzzing on the web. -As long as it's not on the Internet. -That he's stupid. How stupid you are! -I will erase it. - Nothing. I'm going to get some stuff. For shitty wages, work with clowns! Touch nothing! -Listen to me, Garcia. My wife mustn't see that. You and the other crazy, you make me disappear that! You understand ? Look, are you the boss, yes or no? Groovy music -My Michel is coming. -Eh? -Michel is coming. -Oh no, not Michel! -Hi guys ! I'm here to help you. I park and I arrive. -That's it. ... -What are you doing, Ménard? -I'm watching social networks. We have more than 20,000 views on the Net. It's huge, it's a buzz. -It's horrible, it's shame! My wife will think I'm cheating on her. -Yes, that's it, the worst. -Chief ! -What? - It smells like gas! -What? - It smells like gas! -I do not hear anything. -It smells weird. Must cut the thing! -You tell me what ? - It smells like gas! - Stop it, we hear nothing! You turn it off, Didier, or I'll stick one to you! -What are you saying ? -It smells weird. It smells like gas. -But, it smells like gas. -But yes. -I hope you haven't pierced the gas pipe. -But I touched nothing. -We are a team. -Yes, but it's you who... -You are lucky. I'm going to call Gégé, at Gaz 66, it's in the emergency room. He's a guy... You're lucky that I have the resource. Hello? Jérôme, it's Christian! Damn, you answer! Since you are privatized, you have to answer. It changes you! No, I don't want to mess around. We are in Place Bélieu, yes. It's Gilbert, the new one. He made a hole in the gas pipe. Do you believe this ? Yep. You can come ? Yes. With a team, but light. We make it light. OK, discreet. -Ah, Jérôme. -Are you guys? -Okay okay. - There is a leak there. -Well we know. You brought people. -You know some. Christophe, Director of Connection. -It's a leak. -Yes, well yes. - Etienne, director of sanitation. -Another director. -It smells of gas. -Bernard. Breakdown service. Attention: exteriors. Thierry, Interior repairs. - There are only directors. -Benoît, director of all repairs. -It smells very strong. -Jean Philippe. There, there is a leak. -Yes, there is a leak. -Philibert, director of the Subdivision. - There are only directors at your place. -We negotiated it for privatization. The minimum grade is director. -It's private. Result, result. -While with us... So how do you see it? -As long as Mathieu is not there, we do not touch. We don't touch. Ultimately, we clean the hole to facilitate its expertise. -What do we do? -What do you want us to do ? We're having a drink! -Ah, there you go ! -I like this. He whistles. -It's buzzing. -It's skyrocketing, Mr. Mayor. -It's a leak. -Please, everyone. Mathieu, the Director of Expertises, is formal. It's a leak. So two solutions: either we tackle it seriously, with triple report, expertise, and we come across May 1st. It means fucked up weekend. Either we fill up. And if, inadvertently, by plugging in, a pickaxe would pierce the big water pipe, as in the case of leaks, the big pipe has priority, it would fall on the mouth of the Water Service. With raised hand, who is it to fall on them? I want finesse, surgery. Do you have someone sharp? -So a sharp guy on my team... A sharp guy... Good Ben Michel... I think you're not free. Maurice, you're sick. Diego, you're not there. Bruno, don't touch anything. Nicolas... We don't change a winning team. No, a sharp guy, I see that... Gilbert. -Eh? -Gilbert. -Me ? Oh no ! I'm not... Did we say surgical, then? Cars starting ... Hey guys! Wait for me ! -What is that again? Firemen sirens Crash -They moved the coffee machine Without a word, without a letter And when we got to the workshop hallway She was no longer there She was no longer there She was no longer there She was no longer there! She was no longer there! ... (In a sad voice) - "A desire for thrush? "May 1st to celebrate? "Buy your lilies of the valley at Cindy Fleurs. "Cindy Fleurs, this is where I buy my lilies of the valley." -Children, one must absolutely pay his emergency contribution. Gilles, what am I learning? -What? -Didn't you pay your membership fee? No subscription, no paella. That's enough. Remember, please! We don't forget to pay our subscription! -So the new one, do we adapt? -Yeah, but it's a shock, the rhythm of the job. And irregular schedules. One day, we hire at 10 a.m. The next day is 11 a.m. Or noon! -Me too, it had disturbed me. It had disrupted transit. And then gradually, it came back in order. -Content for your transit. I adapt. I learned how to install RTTs. -It's important. They say you come from Collioure. -I live alone with mom. -I hope it's not a very old apartment. -Yes why ? -For nothing. It is not serious. What a cannon, this Gilbert. I would empty the trash there. -17.43 meters. -Your measurements always end in 43. -I have to, I wear size 43, in life. -I'm stupid! -If it was good, the Mélenchon meeting! -I was not here ? -You were not there ! -It's true, I was not there. -Gilbert, are you having a drink? -With pleasure. - Go to Gilbert, give him something. -I have Montbéliard rosé. But it is corrosive. -Otherwise, white wine from Indre. It is acidic. -White wine. -We know you paid for it. -Health! -450 euros. You want me to do what ? -I recognize. -It's the one who changes the voice. -He is strict. -Are there any songs? -Cubi chips. -Oh yeah ! - Red! -He's alive, the other asshole. He farts us on May 1st. Shut your mouth ! Stop, it's untenable. -Wait, he's going to play "Mariza", his hit. It was a hit with the strike of the espadrilles factory! -Bravo, Rémi, it's good! -I'm not done. -You will finish it later. I put your guitar down. -But, my guitar! -Yeah, well here. -I have one in the car. -When it doesn't... Good, comrades! Welcome to this great May Day celebration! So, above all... you will not forget to pay your contributions to Gislaine. -I didn't know about... -Hush! My husband is speaking. ... our union treasurer. Make an ovation to Michel! Michel! -MICHEL! MICHEL! MICHEL! -Do you see the keys? I will never forgive you. I will never forgive you! MICHEL! MICHEL! Cheers -Marades... But where are you ? -But they are there! Michel, sit down. -I'm tired. -You will feel like you are at work. Dear friends... May 1st is a great day, and doubly a great day, because we welcome a new comrade. Make it a triumph. His name is Gilbert! -GILBERT! GILBERT! GILBERT! Cheers -He has a wild side, feline. -You have red eyes. -It's chlorine tests. -You don't bathe. -I'm not swimming, I'm at the checkout. This is to tell you the doses! Gilbert! Gilbert! Gilbert! -Fist. First point, we are delighted with your presence among us and we thank you for spontaneously joining the union. It applauds! Second point... Laughs But Gilbert, second point! We discuss. "Second point, comma..." We thank you, I saw that you put your name on the volunteer notebook to sell the remains of thrush on May 2. It's wonderful on your part, especially considering our sales principles. No returns, no unsold. All that does not leave is for your mouth! -I team up with him! -She's not a skimmer, it's a heat pump. So Gilbert, we wanted to mark the occasion and give you a present. Like everyone else, we could have offered you household appliances. A microwave, a TV, a fridge. Well no ! Gilbert, we invented a gift for you. And it's Béné and Yolande who will bring it. Get moving, girls! -We arrive ! - Damn, then! It's good, the parakeets. Return to the aviary. Gilbert, this is the gift. The union gives it to you. Now... Gilbert will open the gift. If you ever, comrades, you like it too, don't forget to make a big "Oh" of satisfaction. -OH ! -Gilbert, you wonder: "But what is this tool?" It is a tendonitis accelerator! You see, it's a set of sleeves, consisting of handles of different diameters. Handle of shovel, rake, hammer. And sleeve... it depends... but rather a broom. And what is this one? It’s a universal handle, that makes the whole family happy! Laughs -So, tendonitis accelerator, that is to say that in the evening, at your place, you can accelerate the tendonitis for a few years. To maybe one day get a pension, be disabled... 10, 15, 20%... Who knows, we can dream! You stretch your neck and save time. Laughs I feel you moved. Maybe you want to say a word. -With pleasure. I would like to thank you... -Thank you it's perfect. Now let's meet at the bar for Gilbert's welcome drink! Groovy music ... -And Jean-Mi, there, who called me a facho. You called me a facho! -Yeah. - Me, facho? Repeat it, to see! I can be very stupid, you know. ... -I have the guitar, guys! -You're not going to sing, you! ... -Look at that, Ménard! We think we are dreaming! "The May Day celebration turns into a masquerade. "The spirits warmed yesterday at the Krasucki space. "A fight has broken out between unionists "and alcohol seems to have contributed to this unfortunate outcome. "Yes, we can say, "The image of the city, once again, has not improved." Out there! And finished the comedia ! Garcia, laid off! Lavergne, fired! -Yes! - Municipal, the situation is serious. The injustice has struck again. The corrupt mayor and the deceitful Mr. Ménard have decided. Gilbert Lavergne is fired. And I myself am laid off. We are on the heavy. Ceausescu, next to it, was nothing. Pol Pot, an amateur, Trump, a communist! What do they believe? That we are going to let ourselves be gagged, suffocated, martyred? In Banyuls, in Narbonne, perhaps. In Collioure, surely. But in Port-Vendres, no. We are the lifeblood of the city. -Are you okay, Teddy? -No, it's shit. -The revolt is on! Personal message to Gilbert Lavergne: "Don't panic, we need to talk to each other. "Call back. Anyway, I know where to find you." Gilbert! Are you okay with fishing? -Yeah. -She is pretty, your Catalan boat. -You want to take a ride? -With pleasure. - Come, we will take the opportunity to discuss. Did you listen to the radio? -No. -So you haven't listened to the radio? -I tell you no. -Look, Gilbert! Look at this beautiful fish. This is a beautiful beast. Look at this. -What is that ? -A Roman amphora. I bought it for 3 euros outside of Perpignan. I leave it for 6 months in the water, it becomes Roman. And it is worth 500 euros. And if I sell it to a specialist, it is worth 1,000 euros. We have to make bonuses! It's not with our poverty wages... -It's certain. That's crazy. You will have me... You will have taught me everything. -Well yeah, we can say that. -It's crazy how clear it is. I see fish there. -Gilbert. -Yes ? -I have... I have something to tell you. -Yes ? -I don't know how to tell you. Gilbert... You're fired. You're fired. -But why ? -But why ? -I know... Fired from an unwelcome job, it seems unthinkable. But you were right, mom. In Port-Vendres, to see a brilliant Collioure guy like that, they have not supported. Go ahead, Christian. Make him go on strike. He's going to pay me, this motherfucker, with his trip to Mayamaï. Show me what you can do. -Gislaine. I put on the pants of the 1998 French team. -That's the big game, then. -Yeah. What would make you happy ? -A strike from the garbage cans. A guys strike. A strike that has balls. -Let's go. -Look, Mr. Mayor. They are top in spelling. -We didn't take them for that. But what a mess. - Strike garbage cans. Ah, they're smart. And it's Garcia, the leader. -You were right. Garcia is the best. He organized his starting pot on sick leave. It's strong, right? -What a shame ! There are reports of rats everywhere. - Half of the city supports them. -Rats ? -But no, the strikers. -Are you sure, let's not give up? -They will crack. Just don't pay them their strike days. The weak point on the left, Mr. Mayor... it's purchasing power. -And here is a last news flash from Municipaux FM. It is the seventh day of the garbage collection strike. And here, at the request of Christian Garcia, a song, "Hasta Siempre". -Do not insist, Mrs. Garcia. There is no meat for you. Or we have rat. Oh, rat! That, rat, we have it! Every day a little more. Are you okay with the rat? Mrs. Garcia! Rat! No ? Come on! -New news flash. 12th day of garbage strike. The omnipotent and corrupt town hall, still doesn't want to negotiate. Here is a song at the request of Gislaine Garcia, "Hasta siempre". "Hasta siempre" (Carlos Puebla) ... -So it's the showdown. -It's the standoff. -An iron hand. -You piss me off! Lavergne, you piss me off! And you, Garcia... -Oh oh. - Answer, go ahead! Screams It makes the dog pissed off. -Mr. Baldelli, no politician did not resist a garbage or transport strike. -And we carry the trash. Someone knocked. -Come in ! -The prefect's cabinet director would like to see you. -He got his ass fingers out? Ah, sir, you're welcome. Here are the people responsible for this dog. -Hey oh! -Say, what? - Gentlemen, please. Monsieur has something to tell us. -You used a Gilbert Lavergne? -The ! -Do you know the feat that this man achieved? -Me ? Cheers ... -Port-Vendrais and Port-Vendraises! I salute the audience. You know it, Port-Vendres is a city at the forefront, very at the forefront. In exceptional circumstances, exceptional means. I especially want to introduce you to an exemplary employee. Some will say: "Yes, but he is from Collioure." Hoots -No no no. Here, we don't whistle. Shouldn't we reach out to difference? Gilbert... has a passion, fish. -Yes, he's my son! -Well done ! Thank you very much. -It is my husband. -I do not care. -In examining a last conquest, he said to himself: "Here, but it looks like a small grouper." But the wild groupers only born in very pure water and it's been thirty years since a grouper was born in a French port. He informs the Institute of Marine Biology which, after expertise, class Port-Vendres in category 1 Europe! That is to say protected port! Cheers That is to say port helped up to 15 million over 5 years! Cheers -GILBERT! GILBERT! GILBERT! -Because this city, yet so well managed, with rigor and in the sense of the general interest, had big problems. But today everything is resolved, thanks to Gilbert and his groupers! And who will pay? Brussels ! -BRUSSELS ! BRUSSELS ! Cheers ... -Thank you so much. I wanted to thank you, and especially to thank the one without whom I would be nothing. Christian Garcia. The 1998 French team had Aimé Jacquet, President Macron has his Brigitte, and I have my Christian. Cheers -And me, I have my municipal! You are my heroes! -Ah, Gilbert. I have something to read to you. -Stop, you're fucking me. - "Personnel and Human Resources Department "of town hall. "Subject: final appointment." Listen to this. "After deliberation "from the City Council and the mayor's office, "by exceptional decision and for his services to the city, "is appointed holder of municipal services "Mr. Gilbert Lavergne." - Holder? - Holder! -I don't give a damn about that! -For ? -To work. -Are you stupid or what? You are titular. -Oh yes it's true. Damn, I'm stupid. -How to tell you ? A municipal employee is a feline. We don't see it coming, we do not hear him leave. -A bit like he hadn't come. -Here. People don't see the pressure we have. -When you're not there, you can't realize. -They don't know the life we ​​have, what we have to endure. Well, we live it and we support it. Cheers. -Cheers. - You have to live it. -Oh yes. -That's what it takes. Live it and bear it. Leaves and rakes It's the song of the municipal Leaves and rakes It's almost aperitif time -As long as people are there, you should take advantage of it. -Walkie talkies! To say that we almost didn't do it. * It's Christian, do you receive me well? * - Yes, I receive you. And you ? * -I receive you. I can start working at any time. If you don't receive me, you tell me. * -OK, we stay tuned. *-There is a problem ? *-No why ? * -You tell me nothing. * -You tell me to tell you if I don't receive you.
