Stop running! Stop! Stop! - Stop running! - Stop running! Stop! In here! Hurry up! - Okay! - Hurry up! - Stop running! - Stop! Stop running! Don't move! - Stop, I tell you! - Stop moving, granny! Get over here! - Stay back! - Easy! Release the hostages! - Surrender! - Stay back, all right? Stop! You can't escape! Release the hostages! - Stay back! - Release them! - Stay back! - You come closer and I'll kill her! Easy! Easy! Release them! - Andy, you go first! - All right. Stay back or I'll kill her, man! Stay back, you get it?! Not the guns! Yah! - Stop! - Stop! Let's go! Let's go! We're lucky to be alive. Hurry up. Let's go! We're really lucky. Come on! - Where's Zen? - Zen. I'm here. - Zen! - Zen! - Where is Andy? - They're not back yet? What happened, huh? The cops busted the deal. And the package-- the package is still with Andy. That's terrible! Now what? - Funky! Where's Andy? - The cops got him. - You're kidding! - What about the plate? The cops took it, okay? And you actually allowed them to take it? - What's wrong with you? - Hey, what's wrong? If you're that great, get it back from the cops yourself! Cut it out! Cut it out! What are we to do now? Let's think when we're back in Hong Kong. All right, back to Hong Kong. Pack it up, quickly! Hurry, hurry! Come on, move it! Look, the princess is back. - Screw her mother! - Want that? Her mom was the boss's first wife. Hey, I only have one mom. - I'm one of your moms too. - But you're the one I screw. - ldiot. - Let's go. Don't get caught, you two! Okay, is everyone here? Miss Audrey Lok and l paid a last visit to Mr. Andy Lok in prison. Before Mr. Andy Lok's death... he entrusted this will to me. He told me very clearly that we need to wait for his brother Jason Lok to return home from the United States before reading it. What do you mean? And then what? Because Andy's money is legitimate, we have to follow proper legal procedures to be able to claim it. What do you mean legal procedures? Andy's money belongs to the organization. That money doesn't belong to him. What do you want then? Audrey, your brother insisted, on his own, to buy that counterfeiting plate back. The organization lost 300 million. I think at least 500 million should come back to us. - The will hasn't been read yet. - And so what? You'll still need to return the money. Return the money ASAP. It's not a question of whether I'll return it. Andy's will states that it can only be read after Jason's return. Bullshit. When will Jason return then? He'll return at 7:00 P.M. on Tuesday. It's only a few days. Are you the boss here? Who are you to speak like that? It's only a few words. Well, you have no right to speak. This is serious business. I won't say anything. Do what you like! No matter what, you'll have to return the money. That's right, the sooner the better! Hold on. Audrey, did your brother say who's going to be the next boss? We have to have a leader. - Who'll be in charge? - He said nothing. We're in deep shit then. - You sure he didn't mention it? - No. What then? All right. Since this is a matter of the Lok family-- I'm not a member-- Iet me say a few words on fairness. The organization was set up by your grandfather... through blood and sweat. If the successor is not from the Lok family, no one will accept it. So what now? Who'll be in charge? Well... Well, since Andy didn't name anybody... Iet's just vote. But why so soon? Why not now? All the leaders are here today. Why can't we vote now? If it's a leader they can trust, it doesn't matter how long it takes. Well, my vote is for Funky as our new chairman. What do you think? Where's Calf? What's taking him so long? Oh, Mr. Funky, I'll go get him now. Hey, Calf, what are you doing in there? Come out, quick. Mr. Funky says we're gonna vote. Come out quickly. They're going to vote. Hurry up! What were you doing all this time? Stomach. Our blood brothers are all here today. I personally recommend Funky to be our new organization chairman. A show of hands! Well, it's official then. Peter. Yes? You're liable if there's even one cent missing from the will. Why isn't Jason flying here today? He asked for leave and could only go the day after tomorrow. He'll be here tonight if it costs him his job! You got it? Do you get it, huh? Ah. Where's Andy's lucky pendant? I have it. Take it out then! Hey, bro! - You going out? - Yup... and you? - I'm going dancing. - What kind of dance? - Jazz! - Oh. I'll be taking belly-dance lessons too. Okay. Dumby? Where are you? Useless girl. What's wrong? Are you hurt? You wish. Acting tough, huh? That's right. Idiot. You're the idiot. Stupid. I'll prove it to you. - Look at that! - Who them? What are you looking at? Keep staring if you wanna get beat up! You heard! I don't care what you say, but this is your debt for sure. - What? - Pay up! You stole her guy! No, I didn't. No money? Take off your clothes then! Don't! Let's go. Hey. Don't get surrounded. Always keep your opponents in front of you, okay? - You stole her guy, so pay up! - Me pay you? - Strip for us if you don't want to pay! - Let's get out of here! Use your phone to record her! - Start stripping! - What are you doing? Get your cell phone and shoot this! Who are you? Where did she appear from? "To hell with..." Get up! Hurry! You're useless! You, wait here for me if you've got the guts. Don't run away. We'll be back. Wait 15 minutes, then call the police. - Okay. Thank you! - Okay, sure. Thanks. Thank you so much. Hurry! That's her! - Stop right there! - Stop running! Come on, follow her. Come on, guys, let's get her! - Get her! - Go go! - Stop right there! - Hurry! What're you doing? You wanna get caught? Let's go. Your attention please, your attention please. This is a gate change announcement. Passengers of flight 1009 please report to gate 15B. We will start the boarding process in 10 minutes. Passengers of flight 1009 please report to gate 15B. We will start the boarding process in 10 minutes. - Audrey. - Jason! You've lost some weight. No way, I'm not too different. Is your asthma getting better? It's pretty okay. I get it once in a while. - Did you bring your medication? - Yes. Take care of yourself. The air here isn't good. Listen, where is Andy's body? It's been cremated but hasn't been brought back yet. What's taking so long? The family's business is not that straightforward. Anyway, just be careful, okay? Let's go. - Jason. - Hey, Audrey. Why are you drinking alone? I can't sleep. I think it's just jetlag. Wow. You're drinking this on the rocks? I want some. Listen, you haven't been back in like 10 years? Just about. I think the last time I was back... is when I came for Dad's funeral. You never come home unless someone dies. You had to leave on such short notice. Did that cause problems at work? Well, Audrey, I just started a job and can't ask for time off. But it should be okay. I understand. You need to be here for the will to be read. I hope you understand. They're all ex-convicts and it's not easy to distribute the money to them. I had to get the will from Andy in China by myself. Cheers. Cheers. Bobo is in Hong Kong now. Did you look her up? It's been so hectic. Maybe in a couple of days. Remember to bring me along. I haven't seen her in such a long time. - Sure. - Well, don't you forget. I won't. Wait a sec. Why are you so eager to go? Well, I haven't had fun in a while. I see. All right then, I'll be nice and take you. Thank you very much. When everyone is here, we will read your brother's will. Let's wait in the conference room. Okay. Have a seat. Thank you. - Peter. - Hi, Funky. Oh, you're finally here. Where's everyone else? They're on their way here. They're always late. - Jason. - Lucy. Mama Ling. I'm glad you're back, Jason! Is the weather cold in San Francisco? Audrey, why is Mama Ling in a wheelchair? Well, she's almost in a vegetative state. She won't understand a word you say. So, Jason, how have you been? I've been pretty good. It's been raining a lot in Hong Kong these days. Same in San Francisco. It's been raining for a few days. Oh, really? Although, it seems the rain is actually very good for my asthma. All right, all right. Your asthma's better now. Great, ah, let's begin. Sure, Funky. Everyone, we are gathered here today to announce the contents of Mr. Andy Lok's will. Mr. Andy Lok's will is very straightforward. It was witnessed by both Miss Audrey Lok and myself, Peter Wong, his attorney. I will read it now. "l, Andy Lok, on this very day, hereby formally establish in my will, the following bequest: All assets under my name shall henceforth go to Jason Lok and Audrey Lok. Jason Lok and Audrey Lok shall each receive half of what I own." This will was made by Andy Lok, May 14th, 2009. Is that clear for everyone? That's all there is? Well, excuse me, I've got an important meeting to go to. I'm leaving! Well, we know the deal now. Audrey, remember what I've told you. Jason, follow your sister's lead. Anything you don't understand, ask me. Okay? The key to being the killer is to practice more. A straight fist to the throat, practiced a million times, will naturally hit your mark each time. The more you practice, an attack on the eyes, the more you'll hit the target. Dumby, do you understand? - Why you laugh? - I'm not laughing. Don't let me spoil your fun. You won't! Why don't you get a bed? Funky's in that room. You think I want that bed now? Go out on the deck then! Are you shy? No, it's just that I don't want to burn my ass. Then have your girl be on top. Good idea. We can try out some new positions. Forget about that. It'll be like a scene from a horror movie. Can't you even take a joke? Let me get that. Hello? No, I'm not Funky. I'm Hung. Just give me the message. Are you kidding? It's that serious? Hold on. Funky, telephone! - Funky! - Move. - Funky! - What is it? Just take a message. No! He says he has to speak to you now! - All right, I'm coming! - Chiu, please just hang on. Coming! Is the TV that much better in there? Of course. Why would I take so long then? Hello? - Go. - What's going on? - Just do what I say! - Just listen to him. And shut the door. Was it that bad? Jumped off a building? Okay, that's all. - Who jumped off a building? - Peter Wong. How did that happen? It's a mysterious death. He didn't leave a note. Could it be murder? His death is really strange. Might be related to Andy's money. Someone must be playing tricks here. We've gotta get the money back fast. It'll be bad if someone else gets to it first. Who would dare do such a thing? Audrey and Jason are the beneficiaries. Perhaps... Jason? You think? It's probably someone else. Somebody is up to no good. We've got to get the money back now. Then we'll find out who it is and kill him. Yes, sir. - You sure took your time. - What time are we meeting Bobo? - At 8:00. - It's still early. Early? We still have to cross the harbor. Don't worry. We won't be late. Just look at your dress. I can see your panties. Really? Go and get the car. I'll be out in just a sec. We'll be late. Hurry up! Tonight will be the biggest... As we found the situation... No no! Jason, no! Zen. Zen, Funky is waiting at the bar. - Funky. - Zen. Drinking early in the day? Here. Did that girl come to bother you? Nope. Not sure what she wants. - You've any idea? - Nope. - You really think I killed Jason? - Huh. I didn't. I believe you're not that insane, but the followers may not think the same. I know it's difficult to clear my name. I'm their only beneficiary. Now both gangs and cops are watching me. What about the money? No change. The money belongs to us. Audrey should return it. - What if she doesn't? - She has no say. I'll rewrite the will for her. I'm not joking. I'll do it if I have to. - Miss Audrey. - Miss Audrey. Who are those guys with Audrey? They must be from some charity or something. What do you mean with charity? What are you doing here? These are my attorneys Mr. Liu and Mr. Law. And they are Mr. Chan and Mrs. Lee of the Chinese Red Cross. I've just made a new will. If I die, all that I own will go to the Chinese Red Cross. Everything. Let me show you. Okay. Move aside. - I'll show you how to do it right. - Okay. A good fighter uses his upper arm, Iike a tennis serve. - Got it? - Master. Got it? Master. You call this slashing? Try it with me. See if you can slash me. Go on. You heard me! Come on! Your slashing is good for cutting firewood. - Master, we're leaving. Bye. - Bye. Why are we meeting here? Isn't it great to be so close to nature? What I'm going to tell you is of no consequence to you at all. But for me, it's a matter of life and death. They killed Jason because of that 500 million inheritance and I'm afraid I'm next. If I hand it over obediently... I'll be safe. But I don't just want to survive. I want to live. I want to help you. Help me? Are you kidding me? I have no power, no followers, no influence in that group. Go to them if you want collaborators. But you have good martial skills. We're actually very similar. I'm the daughter that gets in the way and you're just the scar-faced son of a whore. To them we are just disposable garbage. If we don't eliminate them first, they'll get rid of us eventually. They've never treated you as one of them. You have no followers, no power. Is this what you want? They bully me as the girl, unable to fight. I'm no match for them at all. To be honest, Funky is only Father's adopted son. We are his real children! As siblings, we should work together. You take care of them and I the money. Win-win situation, isn't it? There's no hurry to answer now. Go back and think about it. Calf! I won't bow to my fate. It's not for the world to tell me if I can, but for me to show the world what I'm capable of! Think about it! - 10! - 1 5! 5 again? Zen, let's play together. You haven't played the whole night. Count me out. Let's play the dice game. Or Tai Sai? You were always good at that. I said count me out! Just play on your own! All right, all right. Why don't we play each other then? What should we play? The fist game? - All right. - Let's go. One, two, catch my hand-- Zen, I'm so sorry! I really am! What's the matter with you! I'm wet all over! I'm so sorry. Let me clean it. Forget it! I'm going! I'm so sorry. We're going! Let me put it on for you, please. Zen, I'm so sorry about what happened. Please don't be mad at us. Zen, please. Forget it! You girls can go back in. - Let's go now. - I'm sorry, Zen. Bye! You punk. You think I'm an idiot? See for yourself! I came prepared! Okay? Guys! Come out! Take this! You moron! Think I'm an easy target because of my age? He's over here! Kill him! Mom. Mom, does Dad hate me? Doesn't he love me? Dad, don't leave me. Don't go. Don't leave me, Mom. - Mom. - The doctor just left. He said don't move. Don't move. Lay down. Why are you here? Your friend asked me to come. My dear Calf, why are you doing this? Why are you? Calf, it's extremely dangerous. If they find out, they'll kill you. Please don't do this. Calf, don't go please? You'll die a terrible death. Once Funky is dead everything will be fine. Are you crazy? Stop saying these things. You'll die! Are you done? You're always saying things like that! Most of them are dead now! Just be quiet. How did you get like this? What do you mean? Hmm? Why you bring her? What's wrong with you? Why are you crying? What do you want me to do? This is my chance to be great! Jason died a terrible death. Audrey is vulnerable and she needs me. Once I kill them all, I'll be the leader. No! You've ruined my life, you know that? I've been laughed at, always rejected. I've gotten into countless fights because of this ugly patch. I've been called syphilis kid and son of a whore! Do you know how that made me feel? Listen to me. All I ask-- don't stop me. Calf! You're an orphan too. You should understand. "Dear kind soul, please take in this poor mute girl. Give her shelter and food. I'll be forever grateful. From a useless mother." Don't cry. Oh yeah. Thanks for saving my life. Hey bro. Manchester United got into the finals. Do you think they'll win the league this year? When they play, Chelsea will lose. That's great. We'll have lots of money to split. You must be careful, bro. I depend on you. Going dancing again? Yeah... belly dance. Bye bye. Here's 100,000. You attack me together. Whoever beats me, takes the money. Hold on. You mean we fight each other and the winner gets the money? You brainless fool, you don't get it. The six of you take me on. Whoever beats me takes the money. What if I'm not interested? Then I'll kill you. Your strikes are lethal. This is murder! Hey bro, over here. We used to play with these when we were little. Remember this? Bug catching. Frying eggs? - We never played together. - Not at all? Really? Hmm. Come on. Let's play now. Let's go. Here. Take this. Oh! Um... Don't blame me, scarface. Blame it on yourself and your mother. Choose a better life next time. Aren't you thirsty from eating so many peanuts? I don't have water. There's coffee, alcohol and soft drinks over there. Serve yourself. From your drinks? I'm afraid I'll die before peeing them out. How can you say that? You killed Calf and he helped you. Why would you spare anyone? I killed Calf? Are you insane? I think it was you. It's pointless talking to you. What do you want? Hmm... nothing. What could I want? Don't you think you killed Calf a little too soon? Now who will you send to kill me? Do you want to kill me? No. If I kill you, it'll cause me too much trouble. I'm glad you understand. In the organization, I hold the money and you hold the manpower. If we fight each other, it would be the end for all. It's pointless losing all. That's why I propose a little game. Hide and seek? Not my cup of tea. Fight to the death. It'll end when one dies. The winner will be the leader. The truth is I didn't want to come. You are siblings, one family. How can you fight each other? I've never heard of such a thing in my life. I have to try to reason with you both. You two are from the same family. Why can't you settle your disputes amicably? What can I do? She suggested a death match herself. Why are you so stubborn? Because he killed my brother. Don't wrongly accuse me. I'm not. All right. Last one standing. I'll give you a chance to take back your words. Audrey... I hope you understand that the money isn't yours. You'll have to give it back to the organization immediately. After that go with Jason to the States. I've given him money already. It should be enough for the both of you. Remember to tell Jason not to come to my funeral. Tell him to stay in the States and live a normal life. Avoid any further contact with the family. Give this watch to Jason. This bracelet is for you to keep. This jade is for Funky. Remember it's for Funky. - Looking for me? - You're a Buddhist? Weren't you a Christian before? How can you be such a slut with the gods? Oh, I forgot. You used to be a whore. Isn't that funny? Did you kill Calf? Huh? Maybe. It wasn't necessary to kill him. He didn't want to compete with you. Why couldn't you let him live? Everyone who's a threat to me has to die. How was he a threat to you? He was a threat to me, just like this pair of scissors. I have to protect myself before anyone harms me. Now you understand. Oh, you're awake? Why did you tie me up, Audrey? So where were you rushing off to? Let me go, Audrey! Let me go, Audrey! Let me go! Why have you tied me up? Audrey, let me go! Hmmm. Weren't you supposed to be paralyzed? Wow, now you can even drive. You're amazing. Just take the jewelry. It's worth millions. Thank you. I'm so old now. I don't have much longer. I've never tried to seek power. I've been acting dumb for more than 10 years. Can't you let this old woman go? Say something, Audrey! Audrey! If you hadn't told my dad my mom was having an affair, I wouldn't have suffered so much. And you want me to let you off the hook? That was all in the past. I haven't harmed you now. Is that so? Didn't you just step on the accelerator? A loser has to accept his fate. I should have killed you when I had the chance! Really? Well, you're too late now. You treacherous snake! I'll haunt you forever and you will die a miserable death! Help me! Help me! Help me! What do you want? Stop right there! Hey! Stop! - Stop! - Stop there! Stop! Up there! Go get her! Miss Lok. - What is it? - There's an assassin on the premises. An assassin? Miss Lok. It's just a girl. I want the pleasure of killing her with my bare hands. Lose the guns. Yah! Who are you? Who sent you? Speak up. Fine. All right then. I'll beat it out of you. Who's so cruel to have sent you here to die? Now if you confess to me who your boss is, I won't kill you. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me now! Are you dumb?
