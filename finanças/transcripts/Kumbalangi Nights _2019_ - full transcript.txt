Usually I don't advise anyone- -but we are kinda, birds of same feather, that’s why. [CHUCKLES] Some feathers are different, Uncle I do have a decent job. Not in kitchen alike you. Uncle, Vindaloo is a lil’ undercooked. [GIRL LAUGHS] Have it, Have it, Idiappam is delicious. Didn’t I save the scene ? Otherwise uncle would have felt real bad.

[DELICATE MUSIC] Kumbalangi is an island village in the outskirts of kochi city It is 16 square kilometers in area and, it's India's first designated Eco tourism village we are known for fishing nets and coir.

Eh...it actually means chord and navigators used it as shipping ropes She’s fallen for me. I guess she’s fallen for me. You think so? Then don't stick on with your ‘who-cares’ attitude. Stay gentle enough to win her. It will be all set by the evening. Sumisha: Bobby is not that nice, is he? Look, our Baby is too sweet a girl. How can you find any fault in our guy? He is a nice chap, very good at heart. Hey Bobby, don’t be a jackass, you plucked it? It’s just a small passion fruit. Can you do it again? -Yeah sure Can you please do it again?

Near Anjilathara. Where exactly? Bobby: There is an islet towards the south. You got it bro? The islet near Tekkummuri, where dogs and cats are abandoned. Yes, but now there is a road there. You can come by bike. Isn’t it an ally way besides the shit-land? -Yea, ok ok We only own the path way, 'shit land' is public. It’s changed, the area is clean now. It’s OK, Baby had told me. You are the brother, right? What’s your name? Saji. Where do you work? I run an ironing shop in partnership. I did inquire about your family background. Not impressive at all. How can we send a girl to a lodge-like house? Hope you understand my position. I'm the only one to look after three hapless women. I do care about Baby’s wish. Ours is a modern family which gives enough freedom to women, Mr. Saji, you know, legally a girl can marry any scoundrel she wants, unfortunately that’s the law of the land. But Let him find a job first, then we can talk about it, if and when I am convinced. Bro,the Ramayan was written by a forest-dweller, right? Yeah Look, People can change. Yea, I have faith, you are a decent fellow, it will be alright. Ok? Ok? Sixty rupees please For shaving. -shaving.. I’ll pay. How much? Rs 60 Any issues ? -No, nothing. [LAUGHING] What did you say? Shit land! I could have burst out in laughter. Saji, I think I should move out. Otherwise this’s not gonna work. What nonsense are you talking of? I feel so. What is wrong with our house? We have smoke free kitchen, washing machine, and what not? You can use my room. You need not even ask, c’mon man, have a drink. Frankie: Do we have a toilet here? Don’t we ? It even has a European commode. Is it a proper one? Isn't it almost done? Do not under state things, Frankie, you are doing this for long. You do not worry, find a decent job other than fishing, trust me, I am here for you. All we need to do is, to plaster the walls. Nepolean’s sons can’t go bad … Oft-smelled jasmine loses its fragrance (proverb), that’s all. Frankie: This is the worst house in the entire village. Go, get it. This house lost its life when our mom walked out. What! You are the reason why she left. It’s because of you only, everyone does know. come here. [SLAPS] -Hey Saji, What did you just do? It was not me but our Dad. No wonder, why we are doomed. [FRANKIE SOBS] [SOMBRE MUSIC] [CHIRPPING OF CRICKETS] When I won the lottery, we had had a trip to Kanyakumari. These boys had never seen a sunrise at seaside. I still remember Bonny’s laughing face. That very Bonny, beat me today. [SOULFUL MUSIC] He’d never uttered a word against me, until today. You know what happened the other day? Bobby says that I use up you, I use up you, you are doing all the work, no? For him,I exploit you.. I was about to tell you of this. Sathi and I are expecting the baby soon. I was thinking of moving to the town. When we came here eloping from our place it was you who gave me a life, without you I am nothing. Look Saji, what your brother says is true, we should listen to them, no matter who’s saying, if there is a point in it …. I took care of you for as long as I could.

[MELLOW MUSIC] Hop on, lovely. It’s a small one. Good work, why can’t you try fishing? Isn’t it a lil’ low profile? You say fishing is low profile ! That too, to a piscivore like me ! Life is a tale untold; let’s deliquesce in it, deep and, mellow It may bloom someday, unannounced, with honey Saji, Let’s go fishing. Lets go. Did he read my mind!! May fall as sweet rain drops from nowhere, caressing the arid pathways May wing up to touch the clear sky and cross the sea of magic Bonny, the water is spectacular now, why don’t you show her? May become the moon light in the dark; color and fragrance in dreams May play our soul as a lute and give you leaves of memoirs Oops! Go get it, Ashly. I won’t go. I shall go. What day is today? Isn’t it Tuesday? My goodness. [TENSE,FEARFUL MUSIC] [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING] My wife. [INDISTINCT CHATTER WITH BOLLYWOOD MUSIC] Sir? Oh, Saji Sir. Haven’t you had food? Not yet. What about the proposal, Can’t we think of it now? If possible, please let it happen. I often think of your words. Ramayana and the forest dweller who wrote it. My friend had advised to stay alongside right points. Now we are way better, life is much more peaceful. So, shall we think of the proposal? Mom, is it better you respond or should I..? We are not interested in having a relationship with your family. [MELLOW MUSIC] Your brother-in-law still seems unfeeling. Normally what happens, in situations like this? You mean, an elopement? Yes. [CHILDREN SINGING FOLK SONG] What happened? Nothing. Com’on, Tell me I can’t hold it anymore -I thought so. They have decided to marry, They might elope. Soon.. like tomorrow. Come, let’s talk this through, or else it will get out of hands. She might have slept, we shall talk tomorrow. Sleep can wait, Should I wake her up? [KNOCKS] Come out, we need to talk. Mom? -She has slept already. It’s about your marriage. Sit. You should take me as your own brother, otherwise there is no point in talking. Right Simi? -Yes What’s his name, I forgot -Bobby Yes, yes, Bobby. What is his qualification? What qualifies him to sit with me around this table and eat our mom’s food? He doesn’t have even sixty rupees for a shave. Sis its not like that anymore, he is working now. I am the one talking to you, not her. [TENSE MUSIC] So answer me. Do not insult me. It’s not like that, Bobby is a good guy, that’s enough for me. You watch so many trash movies. I meet many people daily, you can’t imagine He is nothing but a fraud. It’s your opinion, I have my own, and that’s all. It’s very easy to say so. I have only this much to tell you, the guy you marry must be as qualified as me. Shammy: Right honey? There is a big difference between them and me. I have a single father, where as they have many. Ok? It’s not possible, technically, everyone has a single father. What did you say, what did you? [TENSE MUSIC] Absolutely lewd!! Call your mom, is this her way to bring up girls? No matter how loud you shout, I will go with him. If you were a boy, I would have thrashed you right her. Don’t yell at me. What would you do? Come down to earth, you have no one but me, mind it. You can’t yell at her. Simi, don’t interfere, I am like her own brother. You can’t go rude on her, no matter what kind of a brother you are. [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [TICKING OF THE CLOCK] I am sorry dear. Please. Dear. [DIALING MOBILE PHONE] Hello..? Hello. Shyju bro, Simi here -Tell me simi Hello, bro.There is a small issue. -What? We had an argument with Shammy, He is acting weird. Has he gone to some corner or so? Yea, it’s been 15 minutes straight. Do not worry, he will be alright soon. I shall come tomorrow. You don’t ask him anything about it, he has this problem of fits, nothing to worry though. I will be there in the morning. Ok then. What? He will be alright. Simi. [TENSE MUSIC] Come let’s sleep. [SATHI HUMMING A LULLABY] Bobby, she will go tomorrow, I think she doesn’t want to trouble us. You don’t need to go, you can stay here, and we have no problems at all. When I eloped with Vijay, my mom cursed me. The curse would follow to ruin here. that’s my fate. Then you have found the right place. There is nothing left here to be ruined. For you, this is the worst house in the village, isn’t it Frankie? Yes, this is a dumping yard, no one will come questioning you here, you can stay with us, as long as you wish, like our own sister. Where are you going? I can’t reach her, I guess there is a problem. She’d texted me that the situation is grim. Then I tried calling some twenty-odd times, she is not picking up. Try once again. [PHONE RINGING] //The customer you have been dialing is not answering your call// Frankie: That Shammy is not a good guy. [CHIRPPING OF CRICKETS] [ANXIOUS MUSIC] [SHAMMI WHISTLES A HINDI SONG] [ANXIOUS MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [BOAT PADDLES IN] Let me have a look, you guys stay here, otherwise he could get spooked.
