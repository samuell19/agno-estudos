THE INHERITOR DEATH OF HUGO CORDELL NO.1 FRENCH STILL PRESS MAGNATE HUGO CORDELL DIES WITH HIS WIFE ON BOARD HIS PRIVATE JET NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE SOLE HEIR BARTHELEMY (BART) Bart Cordell! Bart Cordell! Bart Cordell! They're speaking a lot about him in Paris this morning. Politics, press, finances, but what do we know about him? Only that he's on the Alitalia's flight from New York to Paris. Accompanied by his friend David Loewenstein. A Frenchman he met at Harvard. Who is now looking after the Cordell Bank in New York. For the monthly TV program "The Man of the Month"... Cordell is perfect, the French don't know who he is. We'll tell them! No, Solange, no rose today! No black crepe, it's no use. - Yes? - Mr. Berthier. Here's the final copy for printing. l'm sorry but the heir lands in 2 hours. He'll want to see the latest issue. Don't think Bart Cordell is coming back to France... only to bury his father. Are you serious? lf Bart Cordell were able to do anything, we'd know it. We'll see. Sole heir to one of the Iargest fortunes in Europe... Bart Cordell has all the attributes of a star. Of a public figure of today. Some say he's a playboy, a hothead. They didn't get along so his father sent him off to the U.S. But that's not what the quarrel was about. Cordell fell out with his father because he married the Galazzi daughter. The Italian steel tycoon. Galazzi is the rising star in Italian right-wing politics. - The production meeting is starting. - Fuck the production meeting! His friends say Bart Cordell is a fighter, a winner, a go-getter. ln spite of their differences... his father gave him control of all his North-American interests. He's supposed to be a ferocious rugby player. Then there's the dirty business in Algeria. He was a lieutenant. He had a run in with a colonel who tortured prisoners. l think it ended in court a martial. - ls he Superman? - Maybe a superstar some day. Don't touch that! Anyway, it's good TV programme material. - Moreover, he's handsome! - lsn't he just? What a thrill! l'm on the same plane as Bart Cordell. - What can l do for you? - Buy me a drink. That's a beautiful Algerian fighter's ear! What's wrong with you, Cordell? Come on! Push! On this day, at this very minute. Now! You're worth $150 million. That is: Cordell Bank, the steel mills. The press group, the Wall Street shares po Molio. The shipyard is running at a loss. Am l the richest man in the world? No. You're number 20 in the western world. Look, here's Brayen, the private detective. My father's plane took off from Geneva, bound for Paris. Ten minutes later, it exploded. l want to know everything. - What's up, Legate? - Please, my name is Berthier. My father always called you the Legate. Let me introduce my Legate. l hope you won't fight each other. lt'll depend on Mr. Loewenstein's co-operation. lt'll depend on Mr. Berthier's co-operation. - The Man off the Month crew! - We work for Carnavan. - Go ahead! - Thank you. A briefcase? Good! OK! Mr. Cordell, if you don't mind... Couldn't you find a better picture? l suppose it's too late to change it. Yes Mr. Cordell, the print run is ready. Could you please sign here? The worst newspaper in Paris! Thank you. Liza Rocquencourrt, 27 years old, Globe technical editor. Divorced, no children. What is it that makes her tick exactly? - What do you mean? - Sexually, what do you know about her? Put everything here! Gentlemen, stay here, please! - Please, gentlemen! - Let me do my job! - We're in a hurry, do you know... - The briefcase overthere! - This briefcase doesn't belong to me - One moment, sir! That's incredible, show some decency! Please be reasonable, that's enough! Stop this! l told you this briefcase is not mine! Please stay calm, sir! - Well done! - David, the tickets! Eight tickets, nine suitcases! We must find the woman from the Boeing! Please, empty your pockets. Put me through to the minister! - Hello? - Berthier here, my friend. - How is it going, Legate? - Not well at all! Now you see that it's your briefcase! lt's a conspiracy! At the customs over there! - l'll take care of it. - Thank you my friend. Put me through to Bremont! Yes Minister! l understand, Minister! Goodbye, Minister. Well... Everything's fine, Mr. Cordell. l'll keep this one. Your timetable: limited board meeting at 5pm at the company's headquarrters. The board meeting will be at 2pm in the train to Lyon. You'll take these gentlemen and this Iady along. l'll pray over my parents' bodies. Gentlemen, we're going to the Gare de Lyon station. Cordell is crazy! He had a special carriage brought over from New York to go to Lyon. - Do we follow him? - Of course you follow him! Bon voyage! Geneva-Cointrin Airport. l'll shake up this old group. lf the train goes too fast, they can jump off. They're actually in good form. Look at them! Today they won't have lunch at Lasserre's. They won't arrive at the meeting filled with food and cigars. They won't fall asleep during the presentations. The usual routine. That's not the way to make them like you. Please, no! l'm not trying to make them like me. l'm trying to be understood. l'm interested in making money, and we'll keep doing it! l'm also interested in having our employees make money. - ls that 'participation'? - Call it as you wish. - You know the unions are against! - Do you speak to the unions often? - The employers' union does it for us. -That's what l don't like. l want to visit all our factories. Solve the issues on the spot. For me, the conflict between employers and workers is in the past. And l'll publicise it through the group's newspapers. - We're making a left-wing press! - No, an opinion press! Gentlemen, lunch is waiting for you at the bar, compliments of Mr. Cordell. - Please! - l was getting hungry! Please, come through! Well, l should have been on duty on that day. But l didn't work because l was sick. l had food poisoning. It happened suddenly. l must have eaten something bad at the airport cafeteria. l was replaced atthe last minute. By Campanella, a mechanic who works by the lake. You can talk to me about the newspaper in daylight. l don't intend to talk about the newspaper. l want to make love. l'm not hypocritical about sex. When l'm in a train or a plane, l want to make love. Especially when l'm with a woman l don't know. Generally, l make love only once with that woman. Preferably quickly and in circumstances like this one. Many men are like that. With me, it goes furrther than with any traveling salesman. A psychiatrist would tell me that the exercise of power... and my profession influences my sexual behaviour. ls this presentation supposed to close the board meeting? Even though l'm in a train with someone l don't know... l don't share your fantasies. You have others, l'm very well informed. l know all your little habits. Where is my father? l'm going back to Paris, goodbye. Your Grace, see you in Paris. Are you coming with me? Excuse me, l'm looking for Mr. Marrtin. Yes, Mr Cordell, that's the man over there. Thank you. Come along! Mr. Cordell, your brother passed away a few hours before the Allies arrived. He'd kept that with him all the time. Don't ever forget, Barthelemy, your uncle Remi invented this. l produced it industrially. For the whole world, today and tomorrow, it's worth billions. That's why you're not a child like other children. You are the inheritor. You are the inheritor! l don't believe it was an accident. Besides my mother who must have known a lot of things... and the Legate, who's more of a Jesuithan you are... The best Jesuits are outside the Church. You were closest to him as his confessor. Between us, Bart, there's no secret of the confession. But l have nothing to reveal. Your father's life was like an open book. l felt he was preoccupied lately. But his problems could not be solved by a priest. His first problem was you, rather your marriage. The name of Galazzi associated with his own. That's an old story. lt's true that he never forgave me. See you soon, your Grace. Are you jet-lagged? Remind me how to dial New York. 19-1-212 and your seven digit-number. How are you? It wasn't too painful, l hope. Everything's fine, don't worry. Stay in New York! l want to be on my own for now in order to settle everything. You always want to take care of things on your own. You'll have to explain that to me some day. l'll talk to you later. Let me talk to Hugo junior. - How are you, Hugo junior? - Not too well, father Cordell. And why is that, Hugo junior? Didn't you read the Wall Street Journal? Nickel keeps going down. lt's not very good for your shares. - You don't sound optimistic. - How could l be optimistic? On top ofthat, l wrecked my bike this morning. Excuse me, but the 6 o'clock NBC News is starrting. l don't want to miss it. Good night. Good night, Hugo. You will confirm all the appointments my father made. Bart! l found the woman from the Boeing. l think she's a call-girl. Her name is Lauren Corey, C-O-R-E-Y. She's in the Raphael Hotel, suite 212. What are you doing? - l'm taking your stone. - And yours? - l forgot it in NewYork. - That's smart! Did you say suite 212 at the Raphael? Yes, 212. What is it? - Why did you do that? - For money. - How much? - $2,000. Plus my Paris-New York return ticket. You came from Paris to board my plane in New York? l never carry cash. lf l write you a cheque for $4,000... will you tell me who gave you $2,000 to compromise me? A girlfriend contacted me. This ticket had to be in your possession when you arrived. l don't know anything else. Do you need another cheque to give this person's name? Her name is Gisele Marlowe. She does the same thing as l do but she has a protector. Who? For that, l need another cheque. You'll write the amount yourself. His name is Theron-Maillard. Concierge, please. Across the street, there's a small guy in an unmarked police car. - Tell him he can go to bed. - Yes, sir. From Bart Cordell, l'm staying in the hotel until tomorrow morning. Very well, sir. You're sticking to me. The final destination was never Orly. - That was New York! - New York! Then he was coming to see me. He hadn't told me. You never said he was coming! l didn't know either. Your father was a careful and secretive man. lf he had something important to tell you... he didn't trust the mail or the phone. Or you, it seems! ls there something you knew? - l felt there was something. - l don't care what you felt! Did you know? Same goes for you. You think sabotage was involved, but it's not enough for me. l want proof, go back to Geneva! l haven't heard Mr. Brayen's voice yet. - ls he mute? - No, he's a private investigator. Why do you pay an investigator? To investigate! Not so he can chat. Don't forget to stress the need to reopen the shipyard! - Shipyards, with an ''s''! - Whatever! Gentlemen, please. Please, sit down. Don't smoke during the meeting, please. How many roses do you send to a lady in this city? lf you are polite, eleven. lf you are gentleman, seventeen. lf you are in love, thirty-five. But always an odd number. First we'll discuss the steel business, and then that! What is a better newspaper, according to you? A newspaper that cannot be imitated. ln Paris, there are three or four weeklies like ours. Neither better nor worse. What do you suggest? What do l suggest? We'll change everything! We'll change everything: presentation, content, by-lines. And maybe the chief editor. lt's obvious l won't do Playboy with a centrefold. Come on in! l hope for Mr. Lambert's sake that he's joking. l want to make Globe even more aggressive! The Cordell factories had a 15-million net profit. ln those same factories... the migrant workers earn less than 200 dollars per month. l don't see why my newspaper wouldn't mention it. - You're seeking popularity! - No, l'm realistic! lf l understand you well, it's time to ask for a raise. Having seen your latest pay statement, Ms. Rocquencourt... l wouldn't place you as one of the migrant factory workers. Cordell, Man of the Month take one! l'm going to expose one scandal per week. lt shouldn't be difficult in today's France. lf you wish to, we can suppress this. Are you joking? Aren't you afraid he's going too far? Because if l dig into Bart Cordell's life... l'll find plenty of scandals! Dig all you want, l'll even Iend you a pickaxe! There's nothing to attack him with! What about call-girls covered in roses? So what? We can still go out with girls in France. What does his wife Giovanella think about it? Probably the same thing as Juliettte Carnavan, your wife... when you don't sleep at home twice a week... under the pretence of editing your programmes. - What about you? - l am single. l call you Lisa, you call me Bart, OK? l wanted to ask you a question. What do you do when the taxis are on strike? Will we have dinner tonight only you and me? l'm going to expose one scandal per week. lt shouldn't be difficult in today's France. lt's no good, we'll have to suppress it. SORRY, THAT'S ALL WE FOUND THE MOST MYSTERlOUS MAN OF THE FIFTH REPUBLIC: THE LAWYER GEORGES THERON-MAILLARD. l've been in charge of the purchase of Cordell Enterprises for a year. For a group l can't name yet. Your father didn't want to sell. We could never agree on the terms. Would you be ready to sell now? Who wants to buy? Few companies in Europe have the means for this purchase. - l know at least four. - That's correct. What are they interested in? Steel or newspapers? The whole lot! Are you in regular contact with this group? - Naturally! - And my father always said no? You knew yourfather's anachronistic nationalism! France first, Europe second. Say no for me as well, with a postscript:. lt's not by getting rid of the father... that you'll force the son to sell! Getting rid? It's ridiculous! Do you think people are killed just like that? Just to help with a purchase? It's not the French way! You mentioned a foreign group! l'll soon prove that my father's plane crash was not an accident. My young friend, your view of the world is completely skewed! You've lived the American way too much! A briefcase filled with drugs put in my luggage by a callgirl! lt must be a vision of my skewed mind! l could have been compromised. And your group's purchase offer announced that same day to the board. Who would no longer trust me for good reasons:. The Cordell heir was a drug addict! You're speaking of the American way! We're in the middle of it! MYSTERlOUS DEATH OF A MECHANIC AT GENEVA AIRPORT Campanella was killed, the mechanic who sabotaged my father's plane. What's more... l saw Théron-Maillard. lmagine that foreigners buy the Cordell group. For the steel mills, it doesn't matter. France is filled with foreign investment money. But for Globe and the newspapers... lt's a way of controlling part of the public opinion. The government will never accept that! That means that... l have to take full responsibility for my father's inheritance. Are you sure you didn't forget something? Yes, my watch! Thank you! l always forget it. What else beside the watch? - You're really absent-minded! - You can say that! Little bastard, don't do that again! A left-wing coalition doesn't scare us. We'll lose seats, perhaps many of them. But France will remain seated. And so will l! l hear that your heir has reform ideas! He wants to fire the oId Globe team! l thought Lamberrt was a good man! News travels fast. You know how it goes! They start by leading a newspaper... then they imagine they can lead the country! Since you're so well informed of what's said in my new boss' office... stop having him under surveillance when he travels! lf you please, my dear friend! lt's laughable! There's nothing on him! Really? As you wish! What's happening attable 17? The atmosphere is ice cold! Mr Cordell did book for three. Whatever happens, let's spend the night together! l thought you were interested in being with women only once. The first time didn't count for us. Not only do you go out with two women in public... on the eve of your father's funeral... but you also think you're irresistible! You are a typical male in all aspects! Your idea of women is a century old! They are things, courtesans. l pity your wife. Your father was wrong to resent her. Are you saying that my father confided in you? That wasn't like him. The other day, you pretended you knew everything about me. All the dirt you were told about me! They didn't tell you that your father and l were very close. Good evening! 35, 36. Yes, card no. 36, Marceau, overseer for shop 4 in Thionville. He lost his wife a month ago. Aren't you going too far in popularity seeking. l'm disappointed in you, David. You're the one going on about the Kennedy method. Know everything about the people who work for you! When we visit the Thionville factory after my father's funeral... l'll shake hands with that Marceau. And l'll say: 'l'm sorry for your loss'. By the way, l know you want Lauren to travel with you. l think she's very dangerous. She's too showy for you. Officially, she's travelling with you. lf you absolutely need a woman, take Lisa! She's got the benefit of working for you. No, with Lisa, it's different. And l wonder if she was my father's mistress. l don't know. On the other hand, the myth about Lisa and taxi drivers... lt's completely untrue, the Legate pulled your leg. - Don't trust him! - He said the same about you. That's normal! Did you take the stone back? - l don't see why we can't work! - lt was in the old man's will. We don't give a shit! - No flowers, no wreaths! - No speech or photos either! Galazzi is mentioned a lot in case the Neo-fascists win in Italy. He always was right-wing, parrticularly during the war! Since Cordell senior's death, the father-in-law shows his face. Please, show some respect! Thank you for coming. My name is Pierre Delmas, reporter for Globe. l know your by-line. l'm back from an investigation your father requested personally. l'd like to talk to you alone. l'll return with Delmas, l'll see you in Paris. l think your father was assassinated. l've been sure of it since yesterday afternoon. The Geneva mechanic, Campanella. ls that your conclusion? My evidence is a lot stronger, very different. Your father gave me something huge. What do you know? lt's a long and very delicate story. Stop! No, l'm fine! The Legate! Bart! Come, it'll blow up! He's dead! Come, it'll blow up! lt'll blow up, come quickly! Come! l'll keep you fortwo days as a precaution, but everyything's fine. - l'm cancelling the factories' inspection! - Absolutely not! Everything's organised, you'll be protected! New York on the line. Poor Legate, you look like a mummy without its sarcophagus! Giovanella, someone tried to kill me. Jean is dead. Yes, the one who took care of the roses at Chemilly. lt's out of the question that you stay alone in New York! l spoke to your father about it. You'll take the first flight to Rome with Julien. You'll be safe there. l come to give you a kiss in a few days. lt looks like the minister entered through the other door! - What door? - There's an emergency serrvices door. l think the minister has gone to see Cordell. l shouldn't have listened to you and withdrawn surveillance. l only interpreted Mr. Cordell's thoughts. Anyyway, it's rather good for you, my dear friend. A failed attack before an election is good for a law-and-order parrty. Why don't you accuse us of organising it? Enough! Good, that's enough, you've had what you wanted. There's a minister in there if you want to know! Tell me, what happened to the reporter in the taxi with me? Delmas? l made an appointment for you at his place. You're really perfect. l suppose a new Jaguar is waiting for me outside. - ls it a live one? - Of course! - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. l'm listening. Six months ago exactly, your father wanted to meet me at my place. Here! l'm the only one living in this building. That's what he told me. An international company, Metal Consorrtium, is trying to buy Cordell. l know their financial ambitions, but... l want to know more about some of its leaders. He complimented me, something he did rarely. You're a great investigator, l need you. l answered that l'm not a cop. He said he wanted to publish the results of my investigation. So l travelled in the Ruhr and in Northern Italy, two industrial hell. l quickly discovered what your father had in mind. The man who interested him most was leading the buy-out operation. You know that man very well. - That's what my father meant! - He wanted me to check. l went to the source. Your father-in-law, current leader of the Fascist Italian right-wing. He'd been part ofthe German-ltalian plan of industrial unification... During World War Il. l don't need to remind you of a story. You know it better than l do. ln 1941, your father was ordered to collaborate with the Nazi war machine. He left Europe for the USA with you and your mother. Your uncle, Remi Cordell, couldn't follow you. He died in a concentration camp. l found out that Galazzi was behind Remi's arrest and deportation. l told your father, now l'm telling you! Fascist! Did my father know all that before he died? Of course, l'm sure that's why he went to New York with your mother. To talk to you about it. Put me through to room 25, Mr. Berrthier. Legate, l'm no longer going on a tour in the country. l'm going to go and get my son in Rome. lt's impossible, everything's organised, everybody's waiting for you. l don't give a shit! Very serious things are happening, l'll explain. l beg you Bart, whatever your reasons may be. You convinced me that continuity must be ensured. lt's your idea, not mine. l can let you skip Longwy and St Nazaire but not Thionville. There are two senators, a mayor-MP, the German and local press. OK, one day in Thionville and then l'll go to Rome. Can you prove all of this? lt's huge! l gave all the evidence to your father. l'm afraid they disappeared with him in the plane crash. l doubt it. My father was secretive and meticulous. He must have kept copies somewhere. - Go back there! - lmpossible! My cover is blown in Italy. - What a surprise, Lauren! - What a surprise, David! l'm sorry Lauren, but you can't come with us any more. ls it your decision or Bart's? Bart thinks like me, or rather l think like him. What would you do if Bart disappeared? You know the saying. Nothing grows in the shade of big trees. Maybe l would blossom. ls it a wish? l'm not a whore, l don't go from one customer to the next. Are you able to sit at your typewriter... and write everything you learned about Galazzi? Do you intend to publish it? lf l find the documents, why not? - You didn't tell me everything, Delmas! - That's correct. Several Vatican archivists know a lot of things. About the deportation of the great Jewish families from Rome. - Because Galazzi did that also! - Yes! - How's the hand? - Fine! - Out! For you, it's over! - You'll pay dearly for that! The price for my life has increased a lot lately! There are new developments, believe me, it's hot! Come, we're going downstairs! David! Can't you postpone that trip? lt's a pity for your son. Dad found you very tense. You should really get some rest. l was really touched that your father came to the funeral. Really touched! l'll call you again later. For the time being, he doesn't suspect anything. The polls predict we'll win the next parliamentary election. The slightest hitch could cost us the victory. Gentlemen, be careful! We're all in agreement. lf necessary, we'll go all the way! Be careful, gentlemen! The house is yours, search everywhere! lt could be a microfilm or maybe an old file. Barrt Cordell himself doesn't know. Anyway, it must be found! My father's roses! The roses will die now that Jean is no longer here. Did you use to come here often? As soon as Delmas, finishes the arrticle l want you to do the page set up. We'll do a special insert we'll include at the last minute. ln next Monday's issue. No, l don't want to publish anything without proof! l can't attack my own family without knowing what l do! l'll double the money my father used to give you. For the International Catholic Mutual Aid. l'd like a favour in exchange. Can you access the Vatican archives... on the deportation of Roman Jewish families between 1942 and 1944? Your father already asked that question. l did what he asked. l sent him the document. He has it, or rather he had it. Bart! Stop all that! l love you as much as your father. - Sorry about your wife, Mr. Marceau! - Thank you Mr. Cordell. Why do you let your private police fire union members? Don't talk rubbish, if l had a private police... they would have prevented my car from being blown up! - What about the hellish hours? - The hellish hours? The canteen that isn't soundproof! One shower for 50 workers! Do you think Bart Cordell visits his factories for local photo ops? - Why this visit, Mr. Cordell? - So that my employees can shout at me. - Seriously? - Seriously. l'll give you something to think about. This morning at 6, l was on the banks of the Rhine... to watch workers cross the border to work in Germany. l thought about my uncle, Rémi Cordell. And l wondered if the people employing these workers... were the same who had my uncle deported 30 years ago! ls it a thought on the fragility of Europe? May l quote you? Do your job! - Where is the phone? - Over there! - Our German friends won't be happy! - l know! During the visit of his new empire, comma... Bart Cordell, C.O.R.D.E.L.L... strongly attacked multinational European companies. - Re-reading the last paragraph, quote! - Yes love! The young CEO stigmatised, comma... the presence at the head of multinational companies, comma... of industrialists who collaborated with the Nazi war machine... full stop, end of quote! lf French heads of companies start speaking like that... l fear for industrial cooperation in Europe. - What is he after? - Politics aren't involved here. l think it's the beginning of a personal revenge. Bart Cordell, during his visit, has... Thank you! DEAR MUM, SORRY TO DISAPPOlNT YOU l'M ONLY SECOND OF MY CLASS. l PROMISE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. LOVE, BART. Yes! Room 405? Dinner for two? That's correct. The Europe of sharks! Can't you find something more striking? No, l think this title sums up the article. l don't see why we bother about the title. While it's impossible to issue this inquiry without proof. Without the documents Mr. Delmas alleges he had. Do you think all that comes out of my diseased mind? Do you think l spent six months partying in Italian nightclubs? These documents do exist! Unless someone made them disappear! We have to wonder who was in the best position... to make these documents disappear! - l'm not accusing anyone! - You don't accuse, you slander! One question, your Highness: what would you do if Bart Cordell disappeared? That's enough, you're not here to fight each other! You'll have my resignation whenever you want it. l told you that's enough! What are you doing? l'm calculating Mr. Berthier's severance package. Can l ask you three questions? First, don't you ever sleep? Then, what do these wrinkles on your face mean? And last, what is that thing? This is the Maya stone. A very rare stone, l paid $100,000 for it. Loewenstein lost his, he's furious. - What's so special about it? - That's a secret! l cannot tell you! At least with that, or it's not worth it! - So, are we rolling it out? - No, the issue is ready... but we'll get it out only on Mr. Cordell's personal order! He has one more precaution to take. The most important one! Do it, take Hugo junior as far away from your father as possible! Leave without telling anyone! Call me when you've found a hotel! l'll tell you everything then! Rome on the line, Mr. Cordell! Bart, l'm no longer at my father's, l'm listening. l'll explain everything to you, Giovanella. But you have to trust me! We're at Hotel San Felice. The phone number is 89 28 30, the room number is 46. Yes, Hotel San Felice! Yes, wait a moment, please. Room 46? Giovanella? It's me again. l wanted to make sure everything is fine. Hugo is already asleep, l don't want to wake him up. Yes, l'm taking the first flight for Paris with him tomorrow morning. We weren't followed. Dad wasn't home when l fled. Kiss! Put me through to international information. - Yes Mr. Cordell. - lnternational information, may l help you? Could you check that 89 28 30 is Hotel San Felice in Rome? - Please hold the line. - Thank you. David, my father was right all along. l let myself be manipulated by Galazzi. Early on, Giovanella didn't know her father was using her... in order to infiltrate the Cordell group. - Today... - Sir? l have your information. This number doesn't belong to a hotel. lt's a private number, we can't tell you whose number it is. Hello? Hello? Shush! Hugo, get dressed! lf you were another child, l'd say we're playing a joke on your mother. But it's serious! Quick, we're going! Put the film on five, then credits. Bernard, start the music on the first picture. Sorry to start so early, but there's a lot of work for tonight's live. - We know that! - OK, rehearsal! Let's roll! The writer F. Scottt-Fitzgerald said one day: Show me a hero, l'll show you a tragedy. Tonight, we'll portray a man who's not well known yet. But politicians, industrialist and journalists wonder if he's a hero. And if his life could be a tragedy. l'll explain everything, Hugo! But before all, you must understand something. You're not a child like any other. You're the inheritor. Close up on Carnavan! Jacques! Put him in his place. Start the music on my signal! Now! Take him to the plane, l'll make a phone call. - Go! - Ready for zooming! Change! Yes, everything's fine. Start printing the issue. See you soon.
