[LOGO MUSIC] [EERIE MUSIC] I never believed in heaven. But I learned to believe in hell when Mom sent me there. [SCREAMING] Just when you think I'm here, the moment's gone. Either everything's in the past or it's in the future. There is no now. So where are you then? I'm in the past. [BELL RINGING] We don't have to stop now. Oh, no, that's OK. I've got a class coming up anyway. I've got to study. I must tell you, I'm a little concerned about you, Alex. Your grades have fallen. That's going to limit your options in terms of college. It's been almost a year now since your mother-- Killed herself? Yes. And now your father-- Is a basket case. You know that. You've talked to him. He might as well be dead too. Alex, would you like to come back again next week? Look, Dr. Weaver, I don't even know why I came down here. I can't get her out of my head, and there's nothing that you can say that's going to change that. It's all my fault. I didn't try hard enough. I must have let her down. Hey, Alex. Fine, I'll show you. I'll definitely show you. How did it go? She thinks I'm sublimating. - What the hell does that mean? - I'm sorry. It means she's screwed up. Fucked up, that's what they said I was. You are fucked up. Yeah, but only because I want to be. Come on, you guys, cut it out, all right? Please? Look, those counselors don't know what they're talking about. They're full of shit. You don't fit the perfect mold of a student, they freak. I know, Greg. All right, so why don't you tell me you're all right then. I'm all right. Good. Because I'd freak if you weren't. Watch this. Take off your glasses. Greg. Come on, just take them off. Give me one of those smiles I love so much. OK. Will you hold this? Yeah. Let me see. All right, well, the key is you gotta move the emulsion around while it's still warm, but it should come out. There. Hey, cool. Right on. Safekeeping, all right, buddy. Oh, you guys going to Donny's after school? Um, I don't know. Check it out. It's the new Vertigo Tronics game. It's interactive. The graphics are unbelievable. Yeah? They were handing these out at Dante's, test marketing it or something. They're going to have a demonstration today. So how about it? I'm game. Greg? Um, all right, we'll go, we'll stop by Dante's Inferno, and then we'll get some dinner after. Keep on driving? Yeah. Disappear forever? Wanna go? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Mr. Finster! Stilts, god damn it, I've got my eye on you. Games like Arcade go beyond interaction. I'm telling you, man, virtual reality is the wave of the future. Hey, Alex. Sorry, man, I didn't see you there. Stilts. I thought I told you to stay out of here? Well, I'm just, you know, checking out the preview for Arcade. Check it out. It's going to be in there. It's supposed to be real cool. If it's so cool, then how come they're previewing it in this shit hole? Maybe if you weren't such a dick, you'd see how cool this place really is. Give me a break, man. they got fucking Space Invaders in here. That shits for retards. So what are you saying? I'm like retarded. Is that what you're implying? - No. Cool. Now that I'm standing here, I'm noticing you're an ugly little fuck, and you're making me sick. Stilts, cut it out, man. He'll kick your ass. Hey, hey, hey. You stay out of my face too, man. Back off. I said, back off. You're gonna go after this guy? Shut up. Come on, now, Mr. Finster. Everything's all right. Everything's OK. No, it's not. What's the matter with you? Look at the size at him. Shut up. It's funny, huh? You think it's funny? You're a shit and I want you out of here. Yeah? Well, you place sucks, man. Who gives a fuck about Arcade anyway? Try saying that to my face. Oh, pretty scary. Out of the way, kids. Out of the way. Mr. Finster, how are you? You look rested. Come on, kids, I got something to show you in the other room. It'll blow a hole in your shorts. Out of the way here, kids. Out of the way. OK, kids, come on in here. Don't be frightened. Don't be shy. Come on in. This is Arcade. We think it's going to be a big seller. But do you know what? You're the guys that make it happen. You're the market share that we're all tearing each other apart to get at. It's your opinion that's going to make us or break us. So how about you? You want to give it a try? Oh, no, no. It wouldn't be much of a challenge. See Alex always loses. Never ending design problems, that's what I heard. So aside from the package, what makes Arcade so different? Now there's a man after my own heart. Straight to the point. What makes Arcade different? Is the way it reacts. It responds like a human does. Each time you play it, it changes its strategy. It learns. It adapts, and it's all done in virtual reality. It's so real you'll actually think that you're in the game board. That's impossible. You think so? Why don't you give it a go? Show him what's up, Nick. The cyber gloves are key to the game's response mechanism. You'll be able to pick things up inside the world, tools, weapons, and they'll actually feel as if they're in your own hands. The goggles, they heighten the experience. When we said reality will never be the same, we weren't kidding. What's this button? Escape? Yeah, well, that's in case things get a little intense. It's kind of like an eject button. Things can get a little squirrely, you know. Nick won't need it. Oh, yeah? You're good, huh? The best. So what's the scenario? Am I trying to save a princess? Fighting zombies? Killing mutants? Well, it changes. There are seven levels. Each one is a different layer of the Arcade universe. The concept is you enter the video world itself. The virtual world, and you make your way across the game board to Arcade's brain. It's soul. OK, so let me ask you something. If I die, is it a virtual death or a real one? Like, do I go to a virtual heaven? Can my parents collect virtual insurance benefits? Funny guy. Anyway, how do I start? My treat. Here. Do something useful. OK. Enjoy. Stand back. I am the future. I am Arcade. If you want to play games, you picked the wrong machine. What's your name? Nick. Nick, kiss reality goodbye. What's it doing? It's memorizing his features. Nick? Be careful, Nick. If you spend too much time on one level, I'll send out the screamer, then there's no escape. What the hell? You gotta try this thing. If you really want to. Will you hold my keys? Thank you. So you had a good time? See if you're tougher than your friend here. Enjoy. Kids, why don't you come out with me in the other room? I got an offer that you're not going to be able to refuse. I've got a bunch of Arcades, home versions, and they're free. - All right. - Cool. - Yeah. - Come on, let's get Greg one. - OK. Greg, kiss reality goodbye. Come on, kids, come on. Come on, come on. Now, Arcade is going to be released in a month or so. We need a little fine tuning, and that's where you kids luck out. This is my world, and you're part of my game. Here's some home versions of Arcade that I'm going to give you. As long as you fill out these marketing questionnaires and bring them back. [GROANING] [EVIL LAUGHTER] [SCREAMING] Welcome, Greg. Greg? Stacey? Stacey, where's Greg? How should I know, Alex? Micheal, stick-- stick a cigarette in my exhaust, Micheal. - Hey, Alex. Has anyone seen Greg? - He's probably outside. - No. Yeah, if he gets really bored-- Then he goes outside. So let's go. Let's go. After you and you. And ladies first. You still love me, don't ya, Alex? [HONKING] - Come on. So where is he? I guess he took off. You have his keys, right? And he said you were going to have dinner, so just go home and wait. Nick, why would he leave without telling me? Maybe he's up to surprise or something. I don't know, Alex. I have to go. OK. Sorry. I'm sure he'll call you later. Bye. Bye, guys. Bye, Alex. Dad? Dad? Did Greg call? No. You should go to bed, Dad. Yeah. Hello, Alex. What? I saw you watching me. I heard your mind. It wants to play, just like your boyfriend did. Where's Greg? In here. He lost the game and I won his soul. Let's see if you'll be more of a challenge, hum? Join us. No matter which corridor you choose, Alex, they'll all lead to your doom, because you always fail. Time's wasting. Choose a corridor. I'm coming for you. [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] You failed again, Alex. You've let me down. Are you ready to play again? Greg's counting on you. Oh, giving up so soon, Alex? Then why don't you check your clock. After all, time flies when you're having fun. MRS. HODGSTEN: Hello? Mrs. Hodgsten? MRS. HODGSTEN: Yes. Is Greg there? MRS. HODGSTEN: No, Alex, he hasn't come home yet. All right, can you have him call me when he gets home? MRS. HODGSTEN: I will. I'm sorry to wake you. MRS. HODGSTEN: It's OK. ARCADE: He's never coming home. [DIALING] Nick? NICK: Hey, Alex. What's up? I just called Greg. [EVIL LAUGH] He hasn't come home yet. NICK: Alex, he's your boyfriend. You keep track of him. You there? He's right here, bitch. I have to talk to you. NICK: Uh, we are talking. No, in person. Now. NICK: It's 12:30. I'm coming over. NICK: Oh, for Christ's sakes. You can't just turn me off, Alex. I'm everywhere now. WOMAN'S VOICE: Alex? Just don't think about it. Nick? Nick? Nick? That's amazing. It must be some kind of a screensaver. ALEX: What do you see? NICK: I can't take my eyes off it. I think it's a fractal, but it's beating like a heart. Like it's alive somehow. This game is brilliant. I mean, look at it. It's like a DNA molecule or something. Something weird is happening. What do you mean by weird? Greg never came home, Nick. I mean, a few hours is one thing, but this is different. Something's happened to him. Can you turn off the game, please? - I'm right in the middle of it. - Just turned it off. - Happy? - No. OK, look, I know you're not going to believe me, but just listen anyway, OK? I think the game is alive somehow. Just listen. Now, I hooked it up earlier this evening, and it said my name. Just as I plugged it in, Nick, it said my name. How could it know that? NICK: Alex. And then I asked it where Greg was. And it said in here. Alex, I think you're freaking out here. Greg is gone, and maybe he's in trouble, but it's not Arcade that's doing it. It is. How? Alex, it's a machine. Machines don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, and it was designed to act as if it were alive, but it's not alive. OK, so how did it know my name then? Maybe you just imagined it. You're always imagining things. For Christ's sake, Alex, you're paranoid. Everything scares you. You're just like my father. OK, I've been having some problems lately. Been spaced out sometimes, but I did not imagine this. I did not imagine this, Nick. Sh. I do have parents, you know? - There. Look. It turned itself back on. No, it didn't. It's just a faulty relay or something. It happens. It's alive, Nick. It's listening to us. Shut up. Enough. I'm sorry. Just call the others? I'll try Stilts. He's got insomnia. [BUSY SIGNAL] ARCADE: It's busy. OK, Laurie, then. [BUSY SIGNAL] It's busy too. Alex, she's probably just talking to Stilts. Try Benz. [BUSY SIGNAL] It's busy too. All of them? It's 1 o'clock. Go home, get some sleep, and we'll figure things out in the morning. It's not this weird. Everything will make sense tomorrow. Hey, things always get weird this late at night, right? - I'm not crazy, you know. - I know. Just don't play the game again, OK? Please? So, hey, man, how did your date go last night? Oh, dude, well, OK, I took that girl Laura out. Laura, yeah, the one with the big uh-- Yeah, you know, I grab them, and squeezed them. Oh, you grabbed them and you went whoop. She punched me in the head. Did you put your face in them like that? She kicked me in the balls, man. Hi, Alex. So where is everyone? Sick. Everyone's sick, huh? Damn it. It's a quarter after. We always meet here at a quarter after. Take it easy. Chill out. What's her problem? Did you play Arcade last night? No, actually, as I was just telling Nick. My TV was busted and my dad was watching his TV, some news some other bullshit. You want to hear something else, Nick? I called them all again this morning. All of their phones are out of order. So I made up a list of everyone that was at Dante's yesterday, including DeLoache and all those other jerks, and all of their phones are out of order. Well, it sounds like it's obviously a plot to take over the world, Nick. Do you want to get that straight jacket or should I? Alex, what do you want me to do? We should find out what's happened to them. No way. Nick, if they're fine, great. Let's just make sure. Come on, Nick. OK, but if things are cool, Alex, I don't want to hear anything more about this. Life's too short, you know what I mean? Hey, are you guys cutting? Let me go with you. Just stay here, Stilts. And don't watch any TV. Oh, OK, I'll hold down the fort, Nick. No one will get by me. Just do what she says, Stilts. And if we're not back by say-- Oh, don't worry, I'll call out the National Guard and like this police patrol or something. Listen, Alex, I just want to ask you one more thing. Is it like supernatural evil that you're fighting, or is it like space aliens, like pod people and stuff? Because there is a difference, you know? I mean, one you need garlic and silver-- Stilts. Look at me. Am I laughing? Just do what she says, and don't watch any TV. OK. That's cool. Wait here. No way. [DOORBELL RINGING] - Laurie? Let's go around back. - Shit. She's here. Laurie? Laurie? Laurie! Nick, what are we going to do? Laurie? Laurie? Jesus, Alex, calm down. - Laurie? [ELECTRONIC ZAPPING SOUND] What the fuck? Laurie, wake up. Wake up. I am awake. Don't you see them? See what, Laurie? The angels. The angels. I am the future. I am Arcade. What's your name? We have to turn it off, Laurie. I'm going to turn it off. No. Get out of my house! You don't care about me. You don't care about me. Alex, don't leave me here. ARCADE: You could leave Greg here, Nick, and have Alex all to yourself. Change the channel. ARCADE: Alex, if you won't play the game by my rules, then I'll play in your world. Nothing's happening. Laurie? [EVIL LAUGHTER] Nick, what's happening? I don't know. Alex, move. Alex. ARCADE: Poor baby. NICK: Is she breathing? Then let's just go. We can't. You're right, Alex. We'll call 911. Alex, look around. We broke in, we smashed the TV, no one is going to believe what's happened here. I believe you now. I don't know what the fuck is happened, but it did. Let's just get the hell out of here. I'm taking Laurie then. [WHOOSHING SOUND] Nick? Let's get the hell out of here. What are you gonna do, Nick? I don't know. Vertigo Tronics. What? Well, they made Arcade. Look, it's still a game, isn't it? Somebody had to program it in the first place. So what do you mean? Learn the rules? Beat it at it's own game. You realize that to do this we have to actually play the game? Yeah. OK, let's get going. It's along drive. Hi, may I help you? We'd like to see Mr. Difford, please? Huh. I see, and do you have an appointment? No, but we've been driving a long way-- Oh, I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment, I won't be able to help you. If you'd like, you can leave your name and number, and I'll have Mr. Difford call-- Look, pal, if Difford's not out here in one minute, I'm calling the news and informing them that your fucking game is whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. I'm talking public relations nightmare here, pal. Virgin sacrifices, Satanism, the whole bit. One moment, please. RACHEL: Yes? Rachel, would you be kind enough to tell Mr. Difford that we have a situation in the lobby which requires his immediate attention? Difford, heard the rumors. They're going to axe some people if Arcade doesn't penetrate. How's your quote this month? I have business. Well, then I guess you got nothing to worry about, do ya? See you in the morning? (WHISPERING) Asshole. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? RACHEL: Frank, there are some kids causing trouble in reception. They say they're having problems with Arcade. OK, I'll be right there in a minute. RACHEL: He's on his way. Mr. Difford will be right with you. Have a seat, please. Virgin sacrifices? Gets them every time. So what's up? It's about the home version of Arcade. What about it? It's hurting people. What are you talking about, it's hurting people? I'm not joking, Mr. Difford. There's something wrong with Arcade. Come into my office. So what's the problem? The game is alive. What Alex is trying to say is that the game seems like it's alive. See, we're not getting very far into the levels. We were kind of wondering if maybe you had some tricks or something? I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, do ya? No. No. Don't want that. I mean, that's it? You-- you just want to learn some tricks? I'll tell you what. Would you like to meet the programmer? That'd be great. He's probably in the lab right now. Come on, let's go down. I'll show you. [KNOCKING] No. God. Shit. Albert? What? Having a bad day? Listen, I've got a couple of kids here. They want to know about Arcade. I thought you might give them some of your secrets. Secrets? Your tricks. They want to beat their friends. Come on, kids. I leave you in very capable hands. Thanks, Mr. Difford. ALBERT: Yeah, thanks a lot, Difford. Well, uh, secrets and tricks, huh? What do you want? We're having some problems with Arcade. No, shit. Well, who isn't? What do you mean? Well, I mean, it's a tough game. It's hard to pin that bastard down. He keeps on changing the rules. Um, we were thinking maybe you had like some programmers tricks or something. Like some surprises and stuff that you had worked into the game? You know, every game's got surprises, even Arcade. Uh, well, OK. Come here. I'll show you the schematics and lay out the entire virtual gameboard for you. Now, pay attention. Now, that's the virtual world. The virtual world consists of seven levels. Now, each level has an exit, a doorway out of that world. Now, the doorways aren't always what they seem, but at least the schematic will show us where they are. So in each world you have to find the doorway to the next level, and with it a key. Six in all. ALEX: How do you beat the game? Right. The keys. The keys are the key. See, they unlock Arcade's heart. From there, you can escape Arcade's brain back to our reality. Only problem is nobody's been able to quite do it yet. Well, anyway, where were we? Oh, right, right, the schematics. The doorways. Here. Now, the fabled doorways. There. You've only got so much time to find them. If you're too late, the Screamer comes. Right. How do you stop the Screamer? Oh, you can't. You can only escape. If he gets you, you're dead. It's like, um, time catching up with you, you know? Fate. Each level you have progressively less time to complete until-- and if you can't find the doorway, bam. If you're lucky enough to cross the sea of darkness and collect your fourth key, you get a free life. Without a free life, there's no margin of error and it gets harder. The next half of the game takes place inside Arcade's brain. Oh, urban scenario, lots of concrete and steel, ugly and mean. The Screamer comes even faster here. NICK: What aren't you telling us? All right, all I can tell you is that it involves a donor, all right? Look, he was brain dead already, so it's not like, you know, anything unethical happened. We only used a few 100,000 brain cells. It's not a big deal. No. That's just it. It's alive in there. It's the one changing the rules. It was supposed to be the ultimate challenge, you know? People driving themselves crazy trying to beat it, sitting in front of the television for days frying their brains. I mean, that's the whole point, isn't it? Keeping glued to the tube. You want my best advice? Don't play this game. Stay clear of it, period. I'd like to, but I'm afraid that's not an option anymore. Alex, come on. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What do you mean? I mean, I've heard enough, thanks. Alex, let's go. - Wait. Wait. If you're going to play the game again, here. You might as well take the schematics. Just remember, it's only a program. It's not really alive. If things get too intense, you can always push the Escape button and you're out of the game. What if the Escape button doesn't work? Come on, Nick. Let's go. Then we'll have us a pretty big glitch, don't we? So where do you want to play the game, Nick? Nick? Um, I was thinking about that. And I don't know, maybe we just shouldn't play the game at all. Just keep on driving. I wish we could. Arcade's a virus, so it seems to me the place to hit it is where the virus started. You know, like the point of origin. [THUNDER] [WHISPERING SOUND] Just don't listen to it. Wait here. I'll go check it out. Nothing. Is it plugged in? I don't get it. It wants us to play. It's been taunting us. You have to put in money. Alex, you don't need to put money in. This game can run on its own. - Yes, you do. Don't you see? It's what it wants. We have to play by its rules. Two players, Nick. NICK: Alex, you're not coming. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Alex, I'm good at these games. I play them all the time. You never play. You'd just get nailed in an instant. And what am I supposed to do if something happens to you? Go in by myself? No. if you're smart, you'll just run like hell. Nick, I've already lost my mom. My father doesn't care if I live or die. If I lose Greg too, I have nothing. I'm going. - You don't get it, do you? - What? I don't want anything to happen to you. I care about you, Alex. It's tough being a hero, isn't it? Here goes nothing. Nick, Alex, all of your friends are here. We know what you are. A harmless monster. I'm nothing compared to the pain of your world. You should know that, Alex. Fuck you. Our parents destroyed us. Your mother turned you into a hollow human shell. Mine changed me into a monster inside this machine. Hold on. And now, I need young souls to keep me warm. Now, kiss reality goodbye forever. Are you OK? Shit, the schematics. Nick, right here. Good thinking, Alex. OK, I'll watch off for the Screamer and the spikes. See if your schematics tell us anything about where the first key is located. OK. There, that corridor. I think it leads to the second level. Now remember, once we got all the keys, we can unlock Arcade's heart and find his soul. And, Alex, no matter what happens, don't worry about me. Keep moving forward. - We're all getting out, Nick. - Then let's go. There. It's a doorway. We've got to try it. First key, Nick. This goes outside. You sure it's Level 2? There's only one way to find out. NICK: Alex? Alex? Don't look at the fractal for so long. Keep moving forward. Holy shit. This is for real. Come on, Nick, we've got to find the next Doorway Alex, keep going. I'll be right there. Alex! Help! Help me! Over here. Help! Alex! - Benz! Benz, hang on, OK? I'm coming! Just hold on. I'm on my way. Don't let go. Just hold on, Benz. Be right there. Benz, just hold on. BENZ: Alex, I'm sinking. I'm on my way. Alex, help. I have the key. Come on, Benz, hold on. The key. Grab my hand. Grab it! Grab onto my hand, Benz. Benz! Benz! Alex? Baby? Mom? [ROARING SOUND] My God. Nick, look out! Nick, don't look at the fractal. The Screamer is coming. Nick! Nick. Oh my God. Nick? Kiddo? Thank God. What happened? I invaded the system and manually activated the escape program. See, I knew something was wrong with Arcade. That's why I'm here. I mean, I needed to see it myself. But I'm seeing it, but I don't believe it. I mean, you know, a program can't come-- Where's Alex? Oh, great. Nick, Nick. Get her out of there. I can't. Arcade fried my interface. He realized what I was up to. - Do something. You fucked it up. Now get her out of there. There's nothing I can do. She's on her own, Nick. She has to play the game through to its end. Laurie. Stilts. You may ask one of us a question. One tells the truth, the other lies. Who you ask remains your discretion, but if the answer's wrong, the questioner dies. The city of Truth is the place you seek. Either boatman will take you there, but the other city is dark and bleak. This is the teller of lies domain, beware. I am the liar. Where shall I take you? I am the truth teller. Where should I take you? What did he do to you? - Is that your question? - No. Wait. No, that's not it. OK, I want the city of Truth, so I want the truth teller, but which one's which? You have no time. What is your question? I'm thinking. You have no time. OK. What did he say? The riddle involves a paradox. Liar, did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right? I came from the city on the left. But you always lie, so you didn't come from the city on the left, which means the city on the left is the city of truth. Too late. You're taking me to the city on the left. What happened to you. I lost, Alex. I won't. Please, lady, help me. I can't swim. Grab my hand. Help me. [THUMP] The city of Truth is at hand. You made it pretty far into the levels. You must be pretty good. I don't want to play anymore. But you're going to have to hang on me. I don't want to stay here. I want to go home. I know, so do I. There's a monster here. We have to kill him before we can leave. I know it's scary, but I'm not going to let anything happen to you, OK? Then we'll go home? Then we'll go home. Stay close to me. Dark riders. If they touch us, we're dead. They're getting closer. The last key. All right, Arcade, I've made it. Where are you? Damn it, where are you? Right here, bitch. Jesus Christ, Albert, the kid's Arcade. Do something, you asshole. All right, all right. What do you think I'm doing? Congratulations, Alex. You've almost made it to the final level. You're Arcade? You're the donor? The donor was a little boy. His mommy hit him until he went to sleep forever. But Vertigo Tronics stole his pain, and I was born. Now no one can play with me anymore. Find my soul in your hell and die with it. Mom? Hi, honey. Feeling better? How you doing? Hm? Oh, you're still feeling feverish. Why don't you run upstairs, then crawl back into bed, and I'll make you a nice breakfast. Oh, baby, what's wrong? Huh? I had the worst nightmare. Oh. It was awful, Mom. There was this game, and it was taking everyone. It took Greg and Nick and y-- now everything is all right, isn't it? I mean, if you had a problem or something, you would tell me, wouldn't you? You'd try and let me help you? Of course, I would. Everything's fine. Come here. Big hug. I'm glad. I dreamt you were dead. - Sweetheart, I am dead. - What? I said, I am dead. Watch. Mom. Mom. Oh, don't worry, baby. Don't worry, it's not so bad being dead. You'll see. Alex, Alex, you never believed in an afterlife, but it's real. There is a heaven, and I'm going to take you there. I'll take you with me so you never have to worry about letting me down again. I didn't let you down. ARCADE: My game's over, Alex, and you failed for the last time. You've let everyone down. Oh, but don't worry, I can bring your soul back and we can play again and again and again and again. [EVIL LAUGHTER] ARCADE: And again. What's happening to me? No! I play by my rules. But guess what, asshole? You forgot my free life. Alex? Alex, you did it. - Greg. Alex? Nick, how'd you make it? I had a little help. Congratulations, Alex. Great job. Poor baby. Hey, we going to send these things in or what? No, I'm serious. I liked it. I want the portable. How'd you do it, Alex? Huh? How'd you do it? It's a long story. You're telling me. I just thought of something. You guys, if we all came out of the game, what if Arcade did too? No. No, Alex, you won. I mean, you played by Arcade's rules. Of course. You're right. Forget I said anything. OK, so start at the beginning. Give her a chance, will ya? Hey, I am giving her a chance. Get off my back. Let's start from the beginning. NICK: Goodnight, Alex. ALEX: I'll see you guys tomorrow. [WHISPERING SOUND] ARCADE: You can't just turn me off, Alex. I'm everywhere now. ALEX: All right, Arcade, I've made it. Damn it, where are you? Right here, bitch. Kiss reality goodbye. [EVIL LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING]
