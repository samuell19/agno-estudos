Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate! Listen, everything's gonna be all right. Mommy's gonna be right behind you. You've got nothing to worry about. Listen, you're gonna look after one another, yeah? Jack, Jill, I love you. I love you more than anything. What's going on? Why is he after us? Mommy's gotta go, but I'll always be with you. You've gotta go up that hill and you've gotta keep going. Never turn back, never look back, just keeping going, okay? I love you. Now go, now go. - Mom, no! - Go, go, go, go! This is Janey Flannen reporting. I'm just about to head into the mountains now. The time has just gone three p.m.. No, there's nothing yet. I've been tracking for a while, but I haven't seen anything suspicious. What do you think I'm gonna find, Bigfoot? Seriously though, I'm a reporter. This is just a trail to nothing. How are we gonna find a story out of this? Look, there's no wild beasts in the UK. And besides, I'm starting to realize just how easy it is for somebody to get lost around here. Sam, hello? Can you hear me, Sam? Need a lift? Were you waiting long? About an hour. Sorry, I took a wrong turn coming off the motorway. Sure. Feel like we've been trying to organize this for so long. Yeah. Just trying to get the six of us, five of us together is quite hard. He'll be missed, babe. Brought me such harm to bring everyone down. No, don't be silly, we're here for you, babe. We lost a friend, you lost more. I am so sorry. I shouldn't been there for you. I should've realized. You couldn't have known, you couldn't know how bad it was. Life's just been so hectic and ever since I moved to London, - I just- - Don't do it. I don't blame you or anyone else. It's fine. I don't blame you or anyone else. You couldn't stop me doing what I did. Anytime you feel like you're being pulled into darkness, please, please, just take my hand and I can help you back to the light again. What is it? That sounded like something Lulu would say. I love you, babe. We all do. Strength in unity, right? We should go. That muck have probably already at Creighton Hill already. Here we go. You ready, Eden? If it ever gets too tough, just let me know. I've got you, all right? Come on then, let's do this, for him. - What is this? - Don't know. Oh, I'm exhausted. Really, Rick? We haven't even started. You sure you're ready for a trekking weekend? All right, let's trek it. All right, so which lucky girl is bunking with me then? Greg, sorry, but boys dorm and girls dorm so no funny business. Yeah, no funny business, Greg! Eden, are you coming? Sure, in a moment. You sure you got enough of that stuff on? What are you looking at, girls? No, local myths and legends, actually. Shit, wild. Do you ever look at girls? Ooh, shouldn't we be meeting the others in the common room? Yeah but first, one for the road. Cheers. Eden, are you okay? Are you going back in? Maybe not. I might go to bed. It's really nice out here. It's not usually my kind of thing. You know me, I'm a bit of a city boy. Yeah, I remember trying to persuade you away from Amsterdam when we were young, a day looking at windmills. Yeah, not a chance. The sex museum though, I mean that was good. Eye opening. I really blew it with you, didn't I? You didn't, Danny. What the hell are you doing? I thought- - Well you thought wrong, Jesus Christ, Danny! What on Earth made you think that? It never worked out between us before. I know. We weren't suited. What, you think I need a pity shag, is that it? No. Or maybe you do. Would you forget it? I'm sorry. I've had too much to drink, typical me, just being a dick. Why did you even come, hmm? You never bothered before, did you, when Lucas was alive. You always had an excuse. Did you ever think that maybe I couldn't face seeing you two together? I pretended it was okay, but he was my best friend, Eden. And then you became the perfect couple. Meanwhile, I'm the selfish prick for being jealous. Look, I'm sorry. Is it tomorrow that we're going on the long one? Yeah. So we'll check out the local sites here, and then after check out tomorrow, we'll head to Silverton. Sound good? Sure, sounds good. So Greg, you know those local legends you were talking about yesterday? Oh, I didn't think anyone was listening. I was. Okay well then, well you know why the area's famous, right? No. Okay well the story goes so in the early '90s, a woman called Kelly Jane Fleming escaped from a nearby psychiatric asylum after being locked away for most of her life. Now although she was locked away for all that time, she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, which led to accusations that she had some sort of twisted relationship with someone at the asylum. - Shit. - Mm, yeah, there were awful tales of abuse at the institution, so. That's horrible. Bet she was desperate to get away for the kids' sake. Well, it gets worse. Apparently, her parents were brother and sister and yeah, they subjected her to years of sexual abuse before they committed here. Fucking hell, Greg, I thought this was meant to be an urban legend. Listen, she was never seen again, but oddly enough, one of the hospital orderlies went out with a search party and he never returned. Some say she died during her escape, but her children survived and they were rumored to live on the hills overlooking a valley. Which valley? Warren Valley. And then what? All right, well some say if you stand on a high point on a quiet night, you can hear her whistling and the area is renowned for missing hikers. Garden! Fucking hell, Greg. Aw, come on. Yeah, great story, Greg. What's next, Bloody Mary? Oh, come on! Look, I'm sorry about last night. Forget it. It won't happen again. I should get inside, I should probably shower. Should we wake her? No, let her rest. Should we wake the boys? Can you see them wanting to walk to a village at seven a.m.? Maybe not. So should we just chill here for a bit and then head back? Yeah, sure. Cheers. Cheers. Morning. Morning. Are you local? Tourists, you? No, we're from the city. Drove all night to get here. I don't blame you, it's beautiful here. It is. Look, I know it's unlikely, but our sister went missing in this area a little while ago. You haven't seen her, have you? No. No, sorry. Are you ladies on a walking holiday? Kind of, it's a bit of a pilgrimage. We're gonna have a walk through the hills. We're here in memory of a departed friend. Oh, that's lovely. I'm so sorry for your loss. Look I know it's a lot to ask, but if you see anyone along the trail, would you mind handing out a few of the posters? - Yeah, of course. - Of course. Are you gonna go out and look for her now? Yeah, we're just heading out on the trial that we think she went on. It's called Silverton, just have a look around and put some flowers out. Well, make sure you're back before dark. You don't want to get lost in those mountains. - Yeah. - Anyway, we should get going. Hopefully see you girls on the trail. - Bye. - Bye. - Thanks, bye. - Good luck. Oh my God. I hope they find her. I know. Poor thing. She has to be here, she's our little sister. We will find her one way or another. There's someone in the woods. Don't let your mind play tricks on you and jump to conclusions. People go missing in the woods all the time. Come on, you all right? Yeah. Bernice, stay away. Hello. Are you okay? Jesus Carla, what happened to her? Do you want some water? I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just here to help. Can I get you some water? Hello? Are you okay? Need help? Are you okay? This wifi is terrible. There's literally no signal. I need to check my brother's been feeding Monty. I guess we did choose the cheap option. Finally. He is the most unreliable person in the world. Eden. Eden. Hmm? What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. Some of the people that stayed in this hostel have gone missing. In the valley that Greg mentioned? Yeah. I thought he was talking shit. Are you worried? Don't know. I mean I guess there are five of us. It'll be fine. I know what I'm doing and Danny's got an indoor climbing. We went to the same place in third year. Plus, this trip's about adventure, not just sight-seeing. Yeah, I suppose. Should we make camp here? There's a lake nearby. Yes, we can skinny dip. Absolutely no chance, not with Danny boy lurking. Plus, it's gonna be about five degrees tonight. Spoilsport. Let's just set up camp here. We can have a few drinks, toast a few marshmallows, maybe even a little Spin the Bottle. Calm yourself, you're getting overexcited. You okay, Eden? Yeah, yeah, just didn't sleep very well last night. Want to help me put the tent up? Lulu's rubbish at that kind of stuff. Yeah, fine. What? Not quite. Girls, tell me I'm not the only one that has noticed. Greg definitely fancies you. Shut up. He does. He's been beet root red every time he's been near you. If he was a dog, he'd have humped your leg by now. Stop it. So ask her out, I know you like her. Jesus man, it's written all over your face. No, no Lulu is one of my favorite people, but that's it, we're just friends. Come off it. She's been checking you out all night. Maybe. But I just don't feel the same way. In fact, I think I kinda like someone else. Yeah? You dark horse. Who is it, which girl? - Someone else? - Just leave it. Leave it, Danny. They don't feel the same way so it's not even worth mentioning. Go and ask him out. If you wait for him, you'll be waiting forever. Okay, okay, fine I will. Just you watch me. She's coming over. Mind if I join you? Don't mind me, you guys. I'll leave it to you, yeah? I think it's great we all get to spend so much time together as a group on this trip. Yeah, yeah, it's really great. Um, it would be really nice if we could spend some more time together just the two of us. I feel like I've hardly seen you. Lulu. Yes, Greg? Lulu, I think I know what you're gonna say but please don't. Look, I love our friendship, hanging out. You're amazing but I just can't be who you want me to be. I can't feel the way you want me to feel. Truth is, I like someone else, someone we both know. Crikey. Tamsen? Well it can't be Eden surely. Oh shit. It's Danny, isn't it? Come here. It's all right. - It's all right. - Oh my God, look at the lovebirds, Eden. Eden! Careful, you might fall. I'm fine. Where are the others? Oh just grabbing some breakfast before we head out across the valley. Come on. You're up early this morning. Yeah, hungover. Overdid it last night. I'm sorry for getting emotional. Oh don't be silly, you don't need to apologize. We're just gonna enjoy the surroundings and have a great time. Sure. You know Lucas was right about this place. Yeah. He was right about a lot of things. We just need to enjoy the moment I think, create some memories. No one knows how long they have left. Look Eden, I know this must be a lot to handle right now. I just had no idea. I think back to that time and I think if I could've done anything or anything differently, if I'd have known what he was thinking- - Yeah, but you couldn't have known. That's the point, he would've had to have told you. And apparently most suicides actually occur because they don't talk about how they feel. And that's why it's really important that you do tell us how you're feeling. Emotions aren't something to cower from. We've got you. That's what this whole trip is about remembering Lucas for the good times, not how he left us. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Breakfast? Whoa, what's that? That's some kind of notice board. So all these people have gone missing in Gilmore Pass? Is that a lot? This isn't the Andes, Dan, it's a lot. This didn't help, not the walls. Christ, I hope we've all been watching those survival programs 'cause we're gonna need it if we go missing out here. So are we supposed to go that way? Okay. So Gilmore Pass is the shortest way to the next valley and it seems like this is the most challenging gradient upper hand leading to some caves, lakes, woodlands and streams and a gradual decline around to the other side. So we go round?- - Oh well there's no guarantee that the steep hill is the most dangerous part. There could be hidden ravines or caves deeper into the pass. Sorted, I like a challenge. I'm doing the climbing and taking my chances. What's the alternative route to Silverton? Okay, well if we avoid Gilmore Pass and go through Bell Valley, it's an extra half day, but it's the scenic route. Well let's try this way. - Okay. - Come on. Guys, this is really steep. I'm wearing shoes for walking, not mountain climbing. It's hardly a mountain, babe. I've done worse in Snowdonia. Yeah, well you climb, Tam, I don't. I'm not comfortable. I did think this would be a bit more relaxing. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this. Yeah, me neither. I mean go for it by all means. I'm climbing it. Yeah, me too. Okay well you guys go. We'll meet around and circle back and meet you at the hostel. Sounds good. Right so you're really gonna do this? You're really that hell bent on climbing? Well we're here so why the hell not? What is your problem? What is your problem? There's no problem from me. I love you, Eden and I really want this trip to be great for you and for Lucas. There are five of us on this trip, not just you. Sorry, I didn't sleep well. Forget it. Look you guys go and we'll meet you later. Greg, where can we converge? Oh. Okay, you guys go up and we'll go down and around. We'll meet at Thorny Kroff Lake which is here. By the time you get up to the top and we go down and around dark will be setting in. So I suggest we set up camp when possible and head to the lake in the morning. It's at least a couple of miles through the pass. Right, so is that sorted, boys and girls? Yeah. Bye. Are we good? Always good. Wow, look at the view. This is stunning. I do wish he was here with us. Me too. It feels strange us meeting like this without him. I find it hard with Eden being here sometimes. I just feel guilty for wanting to cry in front of her. She really lost so much more than us. I just think if she wasn't here maybe we could all just let it out just a little bit more. Do it. What? Let it out. No one's watching. If that's how you feel, just do it. Look, Lucas was a good friend to us all and I think we all just feel a bit guilty 'cause of what happened. So if that's how you're feeling, let it out. Come on, your turn. What is it? You know people think I'm just a dumb jock and I don't have feelings. I know I mess around sometimes but I still feel things. He was my best friend and I let him down. You couldn't have foreseen that. None of us knew how Lucas was feeling. We wasted so much time and we grew apart, all because I was jealous of what he had with Eden. You think I'm not jealous? Why would you be jealous? I love Eden, but it's always about her. First you and then Lucas and Greg's got the eyes for Lulu. No one's ever had the hots for me. Maybe they did but maybe they were just too intimidated to say. That good, was I? It's not that. I just didn't think I'd be doing this on the top of a mountain. So has this all worn off yet? You tell me. I just can't believe I didn't have the balls to tell you how I felt earlier. Did you hear that? Yeah. Do you think it's one of the others? Well it's not a wolf. No one else would be up here, would they? It might be Kelly Jane. Don't. Relax Tam, I know what it'll be. It'll be Greg. I've been winding him up all weekend and this'll be his idea of a prank. I'll go scare him. Babe no, please don't leave me. I'll be right back. Keep the tent warm. Don't be long. Lulu? Lulu? Wait! No! Jill. Jill. Look at Jill. Look at Jill. Danny? Danny? Put that thing down, you're gonna blind me. Danny? Put that thing down. Hey. You okay? I think I just heard her scream. Did you hear anything? No. No I just needed to visit the little boy's room. Do you think the others are okay? Yeah, yeah I'm sure they are. You should rest. We've got a mile uphill to meet them tomorrow. Mother escaped the evil of the world below into the mountains and hills. She escaped to freedom with her two children. One of the evil ones from the institution tried to catch her, to catch them all. He had done bad things to her, hurt her along with the others. Only in the world outside this valley does that kind of evil exist. Mom! Jack, Jill, I'm coming for you. Mom, no! One day, this land will take us. But until then, we must protect it from the outsiders. We will devour them all. Morning. Morning. How long have you been up then? About an hour or two. I've had a look around, didn't want to wake you both. I thought you might still be asleep. You were kind of restless last night. It's hard to be ritz out here, Greg. It's not that, I thought I heard something last night. I had in my hearing aids, I didn't hear anything. Lulu? Oh I could sleep through Armageddon. I didn't hear a thing. I guess we should go and find Tam and Danny. Do you reckon she's throttled him yet? It's possible. I just hope they're okay. I'm sure if we made it through the night, they'll be fine. They're in their element out here. Yeah, I suppose. All right, let's get going soon. It's gonna take a good hour to get up there. I'll get my bag. No sign of them. They should be here by now. I mean it's an absolute dead zone. Maybe they're just running late. You know what Danny's like. I guess we could wait awhile. They could be having breakfast first. Karen! We must never forget. We have the evil in our blood. It shouldn't be taking this long. Well maybe they're busy, Greg, if you know what I mean. Lucky her. Sorry. Maybe I should head up to the top, see what's happening. Well I'd quite like to see what's up there. Maybe we should all go. I'm a little tired, guys. You go, I'll wait here. Besides, it's beautiful. Well, I'll stay too then. No, it's fine. I could do with some time by myself. You sure? We shouldn't be more than an hour. Just stay here, okay? We don't really want to be split up again. I'll be here. Lazy buggers. I bet they heard us laugh. Yohoo. Well their stuff's inside but there's no sign of them. Where are they then? Let's take a look around. Tam! Danny! Tam! Danny! Tam! This is weird. Let's not start worrying just yet. Maybe they're out on a walk before packing up. What should we do? Let's get back down to Eden. Then we can decide what to do. Okay. Tam! Danny! You all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Did you find them? Their stuff was there but there was no sign of them. This is bad. I'm worried they've fallen somewhere. Okay until we know for sure, we just need to stay calm. All we can do is look around. We haven't got any phone service. Yeah, not even an emergency signal. Look it's probably nothing but the fire smell from before, I thought I saw some smoke in the hills in the woodlands. How far would you say? About a mile. Maybe they walked there last night and got caught out by the dark. Might've set up camp over there. Well we should look that way then. I don't like how I look. I still look like them. Breathe, breathe. Please tell me this is one of Danny's stupid jokes. I don't know. Come on, come on. Something isn't right here. Hey Lulu calm down. It's okay, we'll find them. Yeah, if it's animals, we can protect ourselves. With what, Greg, this? What if it isn't animals? Look, we can go back the way we came or we can look for Danny and Tamsen. If you did see a fire, there was no wolf that started it. Okay, no one else is out here. They could be injured, they could need our help. Yeah? I don't want to be here anymore. I want to go home. I want to run a bath. I want to light some incense. And I want to find my center. We'll check it out okay and if we can't find them, we'll head back to the hostel and we'll call for help. Yeah, yeah, good idea. Come on, Lu. Come on. Have we looked enough yet? Not yet, let's go deeper. What's up? I need a wee. Okay, well do you want me to come with you? Just keep lookout. I'll wait here for you both. Keep an eye out. Yeah. Lu? Lu, I'm gonna come and check on you, all right? What's up? Christ, Greg. What's going on? I heard you shouting. I need to check on Lulu. She hasn't responded. Okay, do you want me to come? No, hang back just in case. Maybe she slipped or fell. Lulu? Lulu, have you finished? Greg, come quick. Where is she? No idea. Christ, what the hell is going on? Where is she? Lulu! I think something's happening. Eden. Eden. Someone's been dragged away. You can see the heel prints in the wet mud and footprints that are going in reverse too. Someone has dragged Lulu away. Someone, not something? This is a person. We can't call for help, we have nothing to defend ourselves with. No, we can find her. And then what? I don't know, all right? Lulu was right. We're all gonna die. No, shut up. I wanted to help him. I'm ready, I don't feel anything. No, no that's enough. Look at me. I don't want anyone else to die either. Whatever's out there, look at me, okay? You might have a death wish, Eden, but do you want Lulu to die or Tamsen, Danny, me? It's time to fight. Get up and fight with me. Lulu! Lulu! What's going on? There's something in the woods. We're being hunted. Get back to the hostel and call for help. Okay. Where is she? Where is she? Okay wait out here. I'm gonna go look inside for her. See if she's still on her way, yeah? Yeah, okay. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Where have you been? We need to get inside. No. No, no, no. No, no. I think they're here with us. Come on. No, no. No. No, no. No, no. Eden. Greg. What's going on? Where are we? I think this is the house. Who are they? Jack and Jill. Like the song they were humming. The nursery rhyme. That's them? Danny, Danny. Please, please just let me go. I promise I don't want to hurt you. I just want to go home. Jill, that's your name, right? I spoke to your mother. Sometimes I speak to my boyfriend Lucas. He died. He was taken from me. Sometimes I hear him. He was a good person. Your mother, she was a good person, hmm? I know this because she told Lucas something. Lucas. Do you want to lower the knife? Lower the knife, Jill and I'll tell you what she said. Lower the knife and I'll tell you what she said. Stop hunting. Let me live. Come on, lower the knife. She told me you need to stop hunting. Let me go. I didn't want to live before but now I do. I want to live because Lucas wants me to live and your mom, she wants me to live as well. Okay? Jack? Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Please! They killed them all. No, no listen to me. Greg, listen to me, we're gonna keep going. Do you understand me? We're gonna keep going and we are not going to look back. But Danny. Nope. No, come on. But Danny. No, no. You have to do this, Jill. You know they made a nasty roundabout on your brother. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after. Mom's song. I saw your drawings. She left you here, didn't she, your mother? She escaped from the asylum and no one believed the torment she was put through 'cause she thought she'd lost you both but she knew she couldn't protect you in there, she told you it was gonna be okay. She gave her life to save the both of yours, paying the ultimate price. It wasn't just a nursery rhyme. Look, I know, I know what it's like to lose someone you love. I know how badly it hurts and you must've been so scared in those mountains. I want to go home. Go back to the hill, okay and find Jack and like the nursery rhyme said find paper and plaster and things Jack said. No, no.
