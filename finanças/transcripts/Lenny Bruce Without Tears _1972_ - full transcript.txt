Okay. All right. (man) A little television coverage? All right. Glad to see you. How do you do? How are you? Just let me ask this question. Yeah. What is the purpose of your visit here this afternoon? I'd like to report a crime. (jazz music playing) The crime is, it says 118A, and this is the California penal code. As false affidavits, any person who in any affidavit, taken before any person authorized to administer oaths, swears, affirms, declares, deposes or certifies that he will testify, declare, depose or certify beyond, before any competent tribunal officer or person, in any case, then pending or thereafter to be instituted in any particular manner or to any particular fact, and in... (Fred Baker) It wasn't a bit. Lenny was like that at the end. He'd stopped laughing. ... He knows to be false is guilty of perjury. In any prosecution under this section, the subsequent testimony of each person in any action involving the matters in each affidavit contained, which is contrary to any other matters in such affidavits containing shall be prima facie evidence that the matters in such affidavits were false. Lenny was a funny guy who could hold an audience with his stories. A sweet romantic. He was open about dope and sex before his generation. But that didn't make him a visionary. He had a sense about the war in Vietnam and the religious establishment. But that didn't make him a revolutionary. He was what he was: Lenny. ... Before we picked yours is that in case the juror had heard of me and liked me, we wouldn't have a fair case. If we liked the guy, and so let's give the attorney the opposite, and he said, if you've heard of him, then ask, do you like him, and to find out if there's any priors. But when we say we have never heard of 'em, then the questioning must stop. (man) So you are saying then that you feel the jury had in fact heard of you before the trial, is that fair? No, I don't feel that, I have, their, uh, I have these affidavits and their voice recorded where they all state, six of them, they had heard of me before. You, you feel that this prejudiced the case? No, I'm not concerned with that. I'm concerned with the fact a crime has been committed. (man) We now present Lenny Bruce. (audience applauding) (man) Whoo-hoo! (Lenny) That's really weird, stop. Do you know why you don't like the policemen, most of you, or authority? Because of bad early toilet training. (audience laughing) Okay, he made a "sissy," call the policemen! He made "ca-ca," get the cop--uh, the police... He's not gonna do it anymore. Get the policeman, take him away now, okay. He's eating now, okay, tell the policeman to go downstairs. (audience laughing) Yeah, you suppressed and suppressed... Overemphasis of sex and violence on television will be a deterrent to your child. Why? In the formative years, what he sees now later on, he will do. He will ape the actions of the actor. Good logic, correct; if so, I'd rather my kids see a stag movie over "King of Kings." You see, I don't want my kid to kill Christ when he comes back. (audience laughing) Jewish and goyish; in the dictionary, a goy, one who is not civilized, one who is not Mormon, one who is not Jewish. A Jew, dictionary style, one who is descended from the ancient tribes of Judea. One who is descended from that tribe. That's what it says in the dictionary, but you and I know what a Jew is. One who killed the Lord. I don't know if we got much press on that in Illinois, we did this about 2,000 years ago. Although there should be a statute of limitations with that crime, it seems that those Christians bust us out. Continually-- Why do you keep breaking our chops with that? (speaking in low voice) Why Jew, because you skirt the issue, you blame it on the Roman soldiers. All right, I'll clear the air and confess, yes, we did it. (audience laughing) I did it, my family. I found a note in my basement: "Said we'd get 'em in, signed Morty." Oh, we did 'em up. Hey, did 'em up and then did 'em in. There's no good and bad; people are made to measure up. No good mother, you're not a good mother. It's a good mother. The lie, Fay Bainter, that's a good mother. Andy Hardy's mother, so good that Andy Hardy can bring over 50 guys at 4:00 in the morning. She never calls them bums. She gives them a glass of milk and a peanut butter sandwich. Not chicken fat on rye bread. She's sweet and good and a virgin. (audience laughing) What, do you know why they don't like Americans anywhere? Because we fucked all of their mothers for chocolate bars, what's the matter with you? Do you realize that? ♪ (Fred) His childhood was not exactly apple pie and baseball games. His parents broke up when he was very young. He found himself boarded up with relatives and friends... And then for openers at 16, he joined the Merchant Marine and saw action in World War II Europe. Lenny fell right into that Silent Generation, started telling jokes for $1. And like a number of other cool hipsters, found himself an angle: being offensive. Steve Allen helped promote the Bruce thing, on television, of all places. We get a great deal of mail from our viewers, commenting on our sketches. (laughing) Indicating their likes and dislikes, and, whether you realize it or not there is just about no joke or sketch, particularly of a satirical sort, that will not offend somebody, a cowboy or a drunk or somebody. But we've-- I don't even want to equate those two, already I can see the cards are coming in, it's done. (audience laughing) I'll tell you how we're going to fix the problem. We've decided that once a month, we will book a comedian who will offend everybody. (audience laughing) Fair enough? All right, and then we'll get it all over with, you see? A man who will disturb a great many social groups watching right now. Because, I'm serious, the satirical comments refer to many things, not ordinarily discussed on television, it serves you right. Now that way, the NBC mail department will know in advance, right, if the complaints are coming in; they hire three or four extra girls, they get to stamp answers, we're very sorry, we didn't mean it, you know, that sort of thing. And then the whole thing is handled with neatness and dispatch. So ladies and gentlemen, here is a very shocking comedian, the most shocking comedian of our time, a young man who is skyrocketing to fame-- Lenny Bruce, here he is. (audience applauding) Will Elizabeth Taylor become bar mitzvah'd? (audience laughing) (man) That wasn't rehearsed. No, I promise, continuity, I'll behave myself. I'll do all the lines we rehearsed. That's the thing, I have a reputation for being sort of controversial and irreverent and also a semantic bad trap of bad taste. And actually I do have, and I will always be accused of bad taste by the people who eat in restaurants reserved, service, you know, that kind of scene, to anyone, yeah. But you might be interested in how I became offensive. (audience laughing) I started in school with drinking and really, I was a real depressed kid. 7 or 8 years old and I'd really get juiced. (audience laughing) And so the teacher would really get bugged with me singing and carrying on. And calling Columbus a fink and... (audience laughing) And boosting Aaron Burr and all that. And smoking, I don't know if you can see. Can you see that from here? I've got like a... This tattoo here. Can you see it? I smoked Marlboros when I was six years old and they grew up. (audience laughing) Offend, there's a funny kinda thing. They're semantics, they're words that offend me. Let's see, Governor Faubus, segregation offend me, nighttime television offends me. Some nighttime television. (audience laughing) The shows that exploit homosexuality, narcotics and prostitution under the guise of helping these societal problems. Any, except for a few shows. There's one guy on the coast who's got a nutty sense of humor. His name is Paul Coates and he found out there were kids that, 8 and 9 years old, that were sniffing airplane glue to get high on. And so I had sort of a fantasy how it happened. The kid is alone in his room and it's Saturday. The child is played by George Macready. (audience laughing) (imitating George Macready) Let's see now, I'm all alone in the room and it's Saturday, Mother's away, and what'll I do that's good and hostile? Why, let's see, I'll make an airplane, that's good. I'll make a Lancaster. Good structural design, I'll get the balsa wood, I'll sand that here, I'll cut that off, I'll get the struts now. Now I'll get a little airplane glue, I'll rub it on the rag and uh... Ahh... (imitating a hippie) Hey now, it's a nutty place. (imitating George Macready) I'm getting loaded! Is this possible, loaded on airplane glue? Maybe it's just stuffy in here, I'll call my dog over. Flicker. Flicker, come here, darling, and smell this rag. Smell it, you freaky little doggie. Smell it right, Flicker, Flicker, Flicker! It worked! I'm the Louis Pasteur of junkiedom. (audience laughing) I'm out of my skull for "tinnef." Well, there's much work to be done now. Horse's hooves to melt down, noses to get ready... Cut to the toy store. Any toy store, any hobby shop, might be your kid who walked in that day. Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling. (nerdy voice) Hello, Mrs. Schindler, nice store you got here. Give me a nickel's worth of pencils and a big boy tablet and some erasers and 2,000 tubes of airplane glue. (audience laughing) Well, let's see, what else offends me? Some motion pictures. The motion pictures, that's the thing that I don't like. Exploitation for just the sake of exploiting. Motion pictures that exploit race relations without ever saying anything. I don't feel Hollywood is ever, maybe with the exception of "Home of the Brave," really touched on a good picture that came out and said some issues that were important. Typical brotherhood film. Hey, lay some Spanish music on me, like anything. (Spanish-type music playing) Yeah, that's weird. Miguel, three years old, it's the hour of truth. They're taking the bull away, the bull he raised, the bull he loves. We're hearing Miguel talking to his father. ("Miguel") When are you going to take the bull away? I love him. That's my bull, not your bull. Sometime you see the bandolero and kill him... (speaking in Spanish) That's my bull! I don't like you. (man's voice) Son, I told you. ("Miguel") I'm not your son, don't call me your son because you kill my bull. (man's voice) My son, if you don't understand... ("Miguel") No, how can I understand that you killed him? That one I love. (man's voice) Uh, Miguel if you don't see, I can explain to you. If you, you see, to kill this bull will mean $3,000 of American money. ("Miguel") Then kill him! (audience laughing) He grows. The man, 19 years old and here's where the typical Hollywood brotherhood pitch starts to seep in. The sister talks to him over the shoulder. (woman's voice) Juan, you're making a mistake, hanging around with the wrong gang. Why, Dr. Mendoza, the shop teacher, said you're making wonderful earrings out of that espresso machine. Juan, why don't you listen before it's too late? Juan, over the shoulder and to the mirror. ("Juan") Don't bother me. What do you know? (speaking Spanish) Juan, don't bother me. Give me the rubber there for my ponytail. (audience laughing) Now we dissolve through the exterior of the schoolyard. And there's all the Anglo-Saxon types, you know, they're bright and shiny with their switchblade tongues. And there's Juan, all good with his ripped Madras blazer, and the big pitch comes in. ("Juan") Listen to me. Come on, you guys, when I hear something, I learn in school what I can't forget, do you know what I learned in school? Putting my mind's eye in principle. Don't think I can't forget. Do you know what I can't forget? I forgot. (audience laughing) (Juan voice) I don't forget. Only in this country can copy my friend. I mean, a Spanish guy, okay? Phil is the colored guy, okay? Sal is the Jewish guy. The Japanese guy, a French guy, my friend, in this country we all have to stick together... and beat up the Greeks. (audience laughing) Lenny was just a nice Jewish boy at this time. It was the tube time of Uncle Milty, "I Love Lucy" and "The $64,000 Question." It was 1959. He hadn't really begun to pull his bits from his guts, but even then he had a surface sense about the way things were, and he was starting to experiment, to freeform with his mouth. (Lenny) We took off their clean Jewish love rings, for defense, we took out their teeth, their hair, strategic parts. The children were hidden, we got them out, washed them and put them in the ovens, then on and on and on, getting sicker and feeling that simpatico and all of a sudden, you smile at my faith. You think yourselves any better because you burn your enemies at long distance, with long- distance missiles without ever seeing them? Whew. Even the Pope, he's not a Polack, putz. The Pope is against Christianity, of course, otherwise he'd be with Hess in London. (audience laughing) Lenny Bruce was a shocker. There were rating points in Lenny's mouth, so Lenny was propped up again, under the watchful eyes of the television censor. I don't know what critics you've been reading, unless it's "The Watchtower." (audience laughing) I purposely, I didn't, I had a different kind of opening, but when I heard that in the rehearsal about these scripts, I ran out right away to critics to get some reviews, that I'd say, this is those. This is one review after I did the last show. (beeping sound) "The bad taste award should be given to Lenny Bruce, who out-shuddered every other comedian on television this year," now another nice, warm review. Okay, here's, "Flat joke about don't mail me the money, wire the money, was very unfunny." And that's kinda funny 'cause I didn't even do that joke. But then finally, a newspaper with some integrity came forth, and... (audience laughing) "Last night, a star was born!" Now I know that I've actually accrued a reputation for being irreverent and there's some basis to it; however I'm not all that blasphemous, but then again I realized I'm not a Lenten special, by any means. So I've decided this week to do a bit that has no controversy at all. It's a satire on the two pictures: "It Happened to Jane" with Doris Day and Sabu and Rex Ingram in "The Thief of Baghdad." I remember this picture, the genie was in the bottle and Jane has just left him, and Sabu, thief. (Lenny humming) ♪ I want to be a sailor sailing out to sea ♪ ♪ I like the tinker's life... ♪ (child voice) Excuse me, father? (French accent) How did you know? But you, genie, I've got you in the bottle, and I want you to take me to Baghdad, because I'm all alone here in the desert and I've got no one to play with. Just like you, you little turtle. You're all alone and you don't have anyone to play with either, do you? (nasal voice) Now you have. How am I going to get the turtle? Make some turtle wax, wipe it on the bottle and then the genie will come out. (genie voice) Master, I went out of the bottle, now let me out the cold now. Gina, come off this Jolson jag. Tell me nothing-- I want to talk to... Master, you like it. No master, I want out of the bottle, let me out. (French voice) Genie, don't be that way. (genie voice) I'm getting out now, Master. You-- here I go. (cymbals rumbling) (French accent) You did it. You are the biggest genie, you're something else, baby. (audience laughing) I have never seen such a ge-- You know something? I like you. You're my kind of people. Some of my best friends are genies, came over the house for dinner, nice. (nasal voice) Too late, little master, too late for the milk and honey, I'll risk it with my big toe. (French accent) No, don't lay the fungus on me. (nasal voice) Look, forget about that. We'll go to Tijuana-- No, that's it. Suddenly we dissolve. The proximity to the propinquity change, the genie is back in the bottle, but this time in the back of an old European drug and candy store in Chicago. On Rush Street, the old owner, Leonard Solomon, is cleaning up. The genie is in one of the bottles, unbeknownst to the owner. (man singing in a foreign language) Oh, I never saw this bottle before. It's dirty, there's a cockroach in there or something. I'll clean it up and... Shooo. Who are you? (genie voice) I am the genie. ("Leonard") You come to this neighborhood? (audience laughing) (genie voice) No, old wondrous man. Years ago, Sabu got me hung behind a scene. You have let me out. Now any wondrous wish is yours, old man. Quickly wish. ("Leonard") Well, I'd like to go to Atlantic City. (genie voice) Don't you understand? It's me, the genie, you have to do something desirous. ("Leonard") Where are you from? (genie voice) I am from the desert. ("Leonard") I saw you at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. (genie voice) No, old man, no, wish. ("Leonard") That's what I want, Atlantic City. (genie voice) Very well man, you shall go there. And he was there just like that. Now the genie is taking care of the candy store and he's really doing a wonderful job. He's bringing the guests lots of Mary Janes, the onion rolls, the whole big... Now the old people start to file in, in the morning. Look up, there's the genie behind the counter. (nasal voice) Where's Saul? (genie voice) He went to Atlantic City. (nasal voice) You're Rex's cousin? (genie voice) Madame, I know not the dialect you speak. I'm the genie and I'm taking care of the candy store. (nasal voice) You can take the candy store? (genie voice) Madame, I'm the genie, I can do anything in the world. (nasal voice) All right, make me a malted. (genie voice) You're a malted. (audience applauding) I'm gonna do a bit. I did part of that on an album I did, I did a couple of albums and naturally, most of the humor is too irreverent for television. But this bit concerns-- when you do albums, you have to sometimes DJ interviews. So here's a little bit here I'm gonna do with Steve. I'll be the cat who interviews Steve, Steve is the DJ. Steve, do the thing. (Steve) Yeah, all right, man. Bring in my disk jockey equipment here, turn on the square button. Before we have our first dance, the "Hot Baby Rock," done by the Switchbladers, we'd like you to meet our first guest this evening, Ralph J. Gleason, the most talked-about jazz altoist of the year. Come on in, Ralph. Ralph, nice to have you aboard, fella. Well, good to make the scene, sweetie. (audience laughing) ... Zippo lighter, 'cause he's nearly a natural freak, baby. It's too much, you know? I'm sure a lot of folks would agree with that philosophy, but to a more definitive analysis of your personality. But don't hang me by any political scene. What? Well, don't mix me up with your nitwit thing, you know. I understand there, Ralph, that you're one of the most amazing and brilliant musicians of our time. Well, that's what they say, baby. Swing, you know. Tell me, how long have you had that peculiar condition with your neck? I notice your head keeps falling off. That's swinging. That's what it is? All right, start your collars. Now tell me, do you find that you are criticized by your peers in speaking the jazz idiom? Well, like, who's to say what's normal, man? Oh, yes. It's just like what them great jazz poets like Ira Gitlin, Nat Hentoff, Lawrence Marble, Kenny Drew and Leroy Vinegar and Miles Davis and Herb Cain, just like what all them cats say, man. What do they say? I don't know, but I dig droppin' all them names. Ain't that too much? You wild, you wild. Well, thank you. Now you are rather young to have the title, "The Most Amazing Musician of Our Times." Tell me, how old are you? 28 years old. Mm-hmm. And how long have you been in the business? 35 years. (audience laughing) Wait a moment, you are 28? And you've been in the business for 35 years? What's why they call me amazing, baby. Ain't I too much? Well, that's that new style. You don't seem to be representative of the average musician to me. I'm not a musician, man, I play bongos. Oh, I see. Good there. Yes-- Where do you get most of your inspiration? Wheat germ. You eat wheat germ? No, I smoke it. Oh, I see, well later. (audience applauding) ♪ (Fred) He was making it. Television got his name around, but it was in the back rooms of jazz joints that Lenny came to be an in name. Lenny hung out with the cool and the modern. His friends were barmaids, jazz musicians and bunnies. The freaks of the '50s. Of course, it wasn't that he was of a brand-new generation. As a matter of fact, he was a guy, 40-plus, who spoke for his generation and we all forget because we hear Benny and Hope and Berle, and we forget that people are being born every day and they just don't always speak for their time. He spoke for his time, which was the movies. He equates with the movies, the same way Don Rickles did. Great movie fan, very sentimental guy, very middle-class guy, and I don't mean that as a put-down, but everybody had him up as a Voltaire. When he was arrested once, the judge questioned him about his use of language in San Francisco and he said, "obscenity," and he said, "The way you talk about a relationship between a man and a woman is obscene," and Lenny said, "It's not obscene. In the morning a girl should fluff up your pillow and iron your shirts and make you eggs and bacon," and he painted a very middle-class picture. It's almost a dream now, by today's standards, that anybody would do that for ya. Lenny was expanding his freeform bits. He wanted to go to Hollywood, pooled with a film called "Leather Jackets," and then his own TV pilot. Well dig, if you play... Horace Silver and Oscar Peterson, and together, blindfold me, I won't know the difference, you know. I'm not gonna shock anybody and tell 'em, yeah. And I feel that in a lot of jazz audiences, there's a lot of snob appeal and there's a lot of pseudo people who listen to jazz. And I'd like to get maybe Ralph Gleason, Nat Hentoff, Ira Gitler behind me and say, "This guy is the greatest jazz sound in the world, he's so hip, his name is Lenny Bruce." The guy says, "What does he play?" Well, it's hip, man, he plays money, right? So I opened up in Birdland, blah, blah, blah... Nat, play fours with me, any kind, start the fours, any kind. (piano playing) Lenny Bruce. (money rustling) And they go, wow, it's too much, he's wild, he's out. This is an album I did for Fantasy, and it's called "The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce." Now there's another thing with semantics. There are some pretty far-out bits on the album. My humor, there's never any scatological references to it, I don't do any motel jokes, in other words. Most of my humor lies in the ludicrous, or being just out-and- out irreverent. However, and I was gonna say, actually, there's a lot of truth in the album but nothing sick, except one bit, it's good and sick. So I figured, I might as well be honest and do the one sick bit that's on the album. And also it depends what your point of view is, and it concerns John Graham Green. John Graham Green is a guy, I don't know if you remember, he blew up a plane with 40 people and his mother. And for this, the State sent him to the gas chamber, proving that the American people are losing their sense of humor. When you think about it just for a minute, anybody who blows up a plane with 40 people and their mother can't be all bad. Maybe cranky or something. So thinking like, how it happened, back to the airport. (flight attendant voice) United Airlines, paging passenger Sylvia Green-- That's United, U-N-I-T-E-Y, in case I get sued, I just thought of that. Unitey Airlines-- Tap on that, okay. (flight attendant voice) Unitey Airlines... Uh... Paging a passenger, Sylvia Green, to the flight desk. Will a Sylvia Green report to the Unitey Airlines flight desk, ticket desk information counter. Grand Concourse, now loading for gate 31 for Hawaii and the Philippines. Will a Sylvia Green-- (man voice) Come on, Ma, we're gonna miss the plane. Come on, you old freak, move it there now, hurry up. (mother voice) I didn't know why you want me to fly all of a sudden. I tell you, I'm gonna get claustrophobia all closed in up there. (man voice) Don't worry Mom, you're getting a lot of air. It's a good part for logic, too. (man voice) That's right, Ma, you're getting a lot of air. Cool it, Ma, I've got a wonderful game for you to play before you get on the plane. (mother voice) Games, I love games. (man voice) You'll love this one, it's called "Fill Out the Policy." Come here. (Lenny mumbling) (man voice) Okay, now I've got another present for you and I don't want you to open this up before you get on the plane. Close your eyes and put it in your pocketbook. (clicking noises) (mother voice) It's a music box. (man voice) Yeah, you'll get a good sound. There's a whole Riverside album, it really swings, you'll like it. All right now, why don't you be a good girl, don't talk to anybody, and now the take-off. Ding-ding-ding... See ya around, Ma. Fling-ding-ding-ding... You believe! First stop, Armageddon, sweetie. La-la-la-le, ding-ding-ding-ding, errr... (flight attendant voice) Good evening, my name is Sturges Stephenson. We're cruising... Whoo! At 450 miles an hour, at 600 feet above sea level. If the passengers would like to look over the left wing of the plane, it's the lovely island of Catalina. And to the right, Guam. Well, I don't know what to tell those passengers, this isn't really my scene, I'm a manicurist, but if you want any Chiclets, like, we're hung, we're out. I think there's a jelly donut in the ice box. Well anyway, swing with the magazine. We've got two liberties and one Arizona highway. All right? Now to the controllers, your captain and your co-pilot. (airplane buzzing noise) (pilot 1 voice) Where are we? I don't know, man, I'm so juiced, that airport bar, wow. I had them make me a martini, I'm out of my nut, baby. (pilot 2 voice) Well, cool it and groove with the high then, that's right. Hey. (pilot 1 voice) What? (pilot 2 voice) Hey, we gotta know where we are, man. (pilot 1 voice) Why's that? (pilot 2 voice) That's right. (pilot 1 voice) You got a nutty philosophy, baby, that's something else. Here, what's the difference? They're lucky they get anywhere for $79. Hey. (pilot 2 voice) What? (pilot 1 voice) Hey, what's that thing I get and you're always grabbing it? That moves the wings, man, and does the thing like that. (pilot 2 voice) You're putting me on, right? (pilot 1 voice) No, that's the thing, is that, where'd you pick up on that bit? (pilot 2 voice) Smiling Jack. (pilot 1 voice) That's really weird... You'll do it on the ground, don't ruin it now, you ruined my armature and everything. Bam! (passenger 1) What's that? The back end of the plane just blew off. 15 people just fell out. (passenger 2) Cool it, now, just cool it. (passenger 1) They got 20 more! We're gonna get yelled at. (audience laughing) My luck, right, had to happen this trip. What are we gonna do? (passenger 2) Just cool it now, don't panic now, you cool it, you nitwit, there? (passenger 1) Well, what are we gonna do, they're gonna yell at us, they're gonna yell. (passenger 2) Shut up, just shut up and do it there. (passenger 1) Well, what are we gonna do? (passenger 2) Look, you don't say anything, I don't say anything. (passenger 1) This'll be like Oliver Hardy, right? The guy goes, we're going to get in a whole lot of trouble, Ollie, we're going to get in a whole lot of trouble. (passenger 2) Now look, stupid, I'll do it, and you don't say a thing about it. (passenger 1) What do you mean, don't say anything about it, there's 30 people left. (passenger 2) Let's dump 'em. (passenger 1) We can't do a thing like that, you monster, they're awake. (passenger 2) I don't know what to do, all right, all right-- Hey. (passenger 1) What? (passenger 2) Remember that guy in the second seat... That guy was a real "schtoker," and he was coming on, he knew a lot about planes and he was dropping a lot of big words like wing and propeller and... Yeah. Well, have him come by and we'll do a thing. No, no, it ain't happening that way. Call him up for me. All right, switch on the inside. My name is Sturges Stephenson. Will you shut up with that, you nitwit? Everybody knows your name, moron, and stay out of the icebox. Hurry up and get that guy up here, that's right, he knows all about the plane, all right. Would you help us out? They're cranky. Some people fell out of the plane, I don't know what's going on. I'm sorry I took this gig, it's boring and everything. Would you help us, please? I certainly will, I'll help anyone who's in peril. (whistling) You're in a lot of trouble. That's pretty obvious, everybody fell out of the plane. You've got a bit of a beef. Well, what do we do? We don't know what to do with the rest of the plane. Well, we could put cafe curtains. Would you shut up now? Just shut up, nitwit. All right, come here. While it's obvious that you've stripped the plane of everything, you're going to have to ask for volunteers. For what? You know... (whistling) Hey, what are you, out of your nut? That's the Three Stooges, but... (imitating The Three Stooges) Hey Curly, pow. Mo! Hey, what are you, out of your nut or something? I can't ask you to jump out of a plane. Well, you'll have to, something has to happen. Well, I can't ask him. And I can't either. Let me ask him, I know how to talk to people. Solid, be my guest. (pilot 2) Good evening, everyone. (pilot 2) I got a surprise. It's jumping time. I know you people have been satiated with so many of the Hollywood themes, where the captain and the co-pilot jump out to save the passengers? Well like, it's not happening. I don't want to bug anybody, but let's split. Anybody now. You, the old man. The old railroad man! No, please, I just got my watch. Ahhh! I remember those Gene Lockhart bits... Hey, what about the kid? Oh yeah, the kid, he ruined the walls with a crayon. Yeah. Again, if he's sleeping, that's beautiful. Okay. (whistling) Shut up with the tune and do the bit. (whistling) Sonny, sonny, wake up. Wake up, sonny. (baby voice) Where's my mommy? Where's mommy? Right out that door, Sonny. ♪ (Fred) It was a flop. Lenny didn't belong on television. He made it on college campuses and jazz joints. He was a standup comic who needed freedom. And in the early '60s, he thought he'd found it in places like the Red Hill in New Jersey. The Jazz Workshop, the Hungry Eye on the coast. And the Cafe Au Go Go in the city. And in fact, he had. Married to Honey Harlow, his ideal goyish chick, Lenny was snapping and bouncing his way through a life of one-liners. Honey bore him a girl child named Kitty. Lenny was happy. But when he and Honey weren't happy, they used drugs, mostly speed. And what it did was to make his comedy run a little ahead of his time. When Honey walked out on him, Lenny started to do routines about sex, about his own soul. He'd stand up and explore himself for laughs. And when he did it in front of the right audience, his performances rang with truth and beauty. (Lenny) You put guys on desert islands, they'll do it to mud. (audience laughing) So if you really would cry, you do it to mud and you don't love me, it don't match. They can't explain it, it's weird, they don't take 'em out to dinner, it's just dopey that way. It's a different emotion, a different thing with guys. If you came home and you found your husband, really, sitting on the bed with a chick or a chicken, you really shouldn't feel that you were betrayed or wanna leave him or be that hurt and crying. A chicken! Don't talk to me. In our bed, a chicken. You want dinner, get your chicken to get it for you. Custody was really the get-even, that was where it's at. It's where you can get even, it's the only, the get-even device is to grab the kid. Make sure they never see that kid again. You always hear, the first-week bullshit is beautiful. "I had to get the kid, the kid was wet," all of a sudden, this schmuck is worried about the kid's wet. "I went over there, the kid is wet and everything." (laughing) Had to take the kid, are you kidding? The way the guy's running in and out, the kid was wet. I really loved the kid, where's the kid? With my parents-- Very good, shmuck. The first week, I spend the first week maligning your lady's reputation after the breakup. Blah-blah-blah, that piece of shit. I didn't tell you she was a lesbian, I can tell you about that. But she did this and this, calling up the mother, Mrs. Connors, do you have any idea what a piece of crap your daughter is-- I'll tell you about her. Such a good foundation of such poison that when they go back together, the friends don't want to talk to her anymore. Listen, she's not coming over to the house, that's all. If she does, it's paper cups, what you told me about her. Now the guy wants to see the chick, he misses her. "Oh Vera, the only reason I called you, you left some of your crap over here. I don't know, a hanger, some-- maybe it can be reconciliation, kissing time, hugging time. A very critical time is in bed time after bedtime. Listen, Vera, when we broke up, did you make a lot of guys?" "Don't be silly, that's all you got on your mind. Ah, I don't give a shit, you know?" "Listen, we were legally separated, you know what I mean? I made it with a lot of chicks, you're entitled to make it with a lot of guys. I'd just like to know for the hell of it. Did you make it with a lot of guys?" "I didn't make it with anybody." "Come on, don't bullshit me, I'm not gonna hit you now, I wanna know. Never tell them, deny it, they got pictures, deny it. Just flat out deny it. Tell 'em it's some faggot hairdresser, that's all. Yeah. Who'd you make it-- Just tell me, for the hell of it. Him? I'm not mad, but how'd you make it with him, that fat, disgusting piece of... You cunt!" (audience laughing) I first saw Mr. Lenny Bruce in San Francisco and was puzzled. I then saw him in Chicago and was intrigued. I then saw him in New York and was slightly scared by the nakedness with which this performer reveals himself, and then I began to laugh. To laugh at the wildness of one of the most bizarre imaginations that's ever been let loose on a nightclub audience. And I've been laughing ever since. Now of course, I'm in a minority there, because I think Lenny is-- admirers always will be. He goes out to do a rush job of psychoanalysis on the audience. He goes out to root out their deepest inhibitions, their deepest repressions, all the things they're scared of, all the things that are never talked about, and holds them up to the most relentless scrutiny, analyzes them, tries to force the audience to come to terms with reality. Actual, unspeakable reality. And this is a hard thing to do anyway, and it's even harder to keep it as comic as he does. He will say, lung cancer is a bad thing. Therefore surely, tobacco ought to be prohibited and instead we ought all to take part, as he would call... Um, marijuana. Since it does not cause lung cancer. So by taking a perfectly simple statement, lung cancer is evil, he would have us all smoking marijuana instead. By sheer logical argument. Similarly, he will hold up four-letter words and say, "The fact that I say this word does not mean that I'm going to do it." It is simply a word, it's a sound I am making. Why are you all so sacred of it? Why does it offend and outrage you? It's simply four letters. How can any sane, civilized human being be scared of four letters? At his best, he rises above mere evangelism and moral fervor into flights of fantasy, unscalable skyscrapers of sheer wit and baroque invention that as far as I know, have never had any rivals on the English-speaking stage. (Lenny) I've been really interested in Catholicism lately. It's like there's more churches and people that work for the church than I think there are courthouses and judges. So actually what it is, Catholicism is like Howard Johnson. And what they have are these franchises, and they give all these people different franchises in the different countries, and they have one government, and when you buy the Howard Johnson franchise, you can apply it to the geography. Whatever's cool for that area. And then you'll pay the bread to the main office. Then you have to keep a certain standard, which is cool, but it is definitely a government by itself, and I think that's what we're doing in Vietnam. Because Communists are a threat to those jobs. That's really sad, man. And I think that's what it's always been, that those two factions are always bitching and fighting with each other, and to actually have the tacit government inside our government, and they have this bitch with the Communists, because they're always fighting over the work. And then when they take over, they do them out of a gig, so what happens is that, 'cause Catholicism is here, and the people who work for it are here. And that's another big problem, the people can't separate the authority and the people who have the authority vested in them. (Fred) There was no question who wore the robes of authority in Philadelphia. Lenny's first bust was in the city of brotherly love. It was a drug charge without a chance of sticking. He won the case, and years later, the trial judge was dismissed from the bench. What would really happen, what really went down in Philadelphia was that Lenny Bruce had been identified as sick. In two years, he was arrested a half a dozen times across the country and banned in London and Australia. Something was happening. It was more than just saying "fuck" or "cocksucker." Still, Lenny believed in the courts, believed he would be vindicated. In his routines, he began to examine the arrests and the people who were arresting him. He hadn't thought it through, he didn't know it was really happening, but somehow in front of an audience, his mouth running ahead of his mind, he said it, and he spoke to a college generation that was just beginning to know. (Lenny) Such prejudice, the same in Philadelphia, the same, wanna dig what the judge said? This was an obvious payoff, was a complete bribe, bust-up... This cat says, I sit down after the intro, "This looks like a sinister character to me." (whistling) (audience laughing) Ronald Coleman, that's the judge. (imitating judge) I've heard the case and I must go into my chambers and deliberate. There are many humanist issues here to decide. Raymond Massey, he's the D.A. That's what screwed me up! (audience laughing) Lenny had become a target. Wherever he appeared, police, peace officers, he called them, sat up front. In San Francisco, in Chicago, in Los Angeles. They'd listen to his bit, bust him, and then they'd do his act in court, badly. I must say that I think that bringing this action against Bruce is completely absurd, especially in the town of Chicago, which is, presents to the innocent visitor an array of vice at its most squalid and all for money. And in a city in which all that's tolerated, a city famous for violence and corruption, to pick on this nervous, chain-smoking neurotic moralist and blame him for obscenity seems to me ridiculous. If I might summarize it, you know, there's an impulse in all of us, we have a hollow tooth, we can't resist putting our tongue into it. It hurts but we keep on doing it. I think that Bruce's particular sort of comment on life, the sick humor is a tongue in the hollow tooth. A tongue in his own hollow tooth as a man and a tongue in the hollow tooth of a sick society. And if society's sick, you can't really blame a person who wishes to comment directly on it, by producing a sick commentary. And prior to the investigation, the afore-said investigation, your deponent conferred with the defendant, Lenny Bruce, and was advised that the nature and the character of the judicial proceedings had in the concern that Lenny Bruce, with regard to the seriousness and truthfulness on the voir dire. The voir dire is when they run down the juries and ask them things that related to the case, if they know about the guy before. And he did try the facts of the case, 26574 in department 103 before the honorable Judge Landis. Said Lenny Bruce, evidence apprehensiveness regarding the oaths the jurors had taken, which was in the form of the negative answer to all the questions Mr. John Marshall, his attorney, had asked him, which were in substance, quote, have you read anything about Lenny Bruce? Have you ever seen him perform? Have you ever heard of him, unquote? And their answers were all, they had never heard of Lenny Bruce. Lenny Bruce had reasonable cause based upon three arrests and deportation from England, that was on television newscasts and headlines throughout the country, "L.A. Examiner," KLAC-TV and "Citizen News," did give these arrests with sub-headlines and front-page headlines that relate specifically to the arrest in the Valley, that led to the very trial these jurors were to make an unbiased decision upon. And that he had reason to believe that although they swore they had not heard of him or read about him, they had in fact had, and from the accusations made... (Fred) But the cafe owners got the message. If they booked Lenny, it was trouble with the law, so most of them cancelled. Lenny was nearly bankrupt. His cash went for lawyers, his energy dissipated. That in lieu of a heretofore news exposure, Lenny Bruce had reasonable cause to doubt the veracity of their oath, and that they had never heard of Lenny Bruce and that they would try the facts in the case only. (man) Mr. Bruce, if I could-- Excuse me, sir. And then it would go on to the affidavits of these... He said, "They're harassing me, the officers are harassing me," and he knew that, he was antiestablishment; he, on another occasion when he tried to get a hearing before a three- panel judge to have an injunction against being arrested for obscenity in New York, the-- one of the judges was the former NAACP general counsel Thurgood Marshall, who is now a Supreme Court justice. And Lenny stood before him and he said, "Your Honor, I can't get a job, I can't get work, please, grant me an injunction. I'm like a nigger in Alabama who can't use the toilet." And there's Judge Thurgood Marshall, who suddenly became very Caucasian and said, "Mr. Bruce, you are not a nigger." And Lenny Bruce said, "Unfortunately not, Your Honor." (audience laughing) (Lenny) The reason I got busted, arrested, I picked on the wrong God. If I would've picked on the God whose repertoire is the whoopee cushion store, the Tiki God, the Hawaiian God, those idiots, their dumb God, I would've been cool. If I would've picked on the God whose belly is slashed as a... the Chinese, those idiots, their yellow God. But I picked on the western God, the cute God, the in God, the Kennedy God, and that's where I screwed up. I don't think Lenny Bruce himself is dangerous. I think, however, the trend of Lenny Bruce is. I think the general thing that he represents is, I think it could lead eventually to totalitarianism. I think it could eventually lead to a new kind of Jew burning. I think it could lead to a new kind of gas ovens. The gas ovens and the new Jews of course, being the unhip. Those who dared to say that they did not particularly admire Bruce or his type. In short, it's gonna be the great war of the sensitives versus the insensitives. And the insensitives are defined by the sensitives. And I think in the end it could be a very interesting problem or a result. If our world continues to become more and more complicated and less and less easy to cope with by the individual. (Fred) Then the big bust in the Big Apple, '64. Cafe Au Go Go in New York City. Frank Hogan, the Manhattan district attorney, "Mr. D.A.," had had enough. I sometimes wonder what has happened to our moral values. Lenny was in trouble just as he was beginning to cook. He had been honest, free, an aware man, and now he was on the run, firing lawyers and involving himself in his own defense, forgetting his craft of comic drama and expression. Martin Garbus, his final attorney, was with him in New York. Bruce said a lot of things about the Catholic Church, bad obscenity prosecutions and about pornography, all of which was very close to home with Hogan. If you may remember, in '64 and '65, New York was in the midst of a pornography-- anti-pornography wave. You had something called Operation Yorkville, Father Hill and Rabbi Newman, who had formed a very strong pressure group, and they were calling Hogan fairly constantly. And as a matter of fact, there were many setup cases that Hogan's office had been involved in. So I think that they just overreacted to it, and the fact that it really was only a misdemeanor prosecution makes it harder to justify the many months that were spent on the trial, it makes it harder to justify the great costs that the State went to. It makes it harder to justify a sentence of four months, in this case. The traditional misdemeanor case, where a guy is convicted for the first time, there's never any possibility of a sentence. In the traditional misdemeanor case, I would think the average trial time is anywhere from ten minutes to an hour. And here is a case that went on for months, and here is a case where the guy got four months in the workhouse. And the mitigating factors in the Bruce case, against the guy being prosecuted, his financial condition, his emotional condition, were very high, assuming the guy were convicted of every, every possible charge he shouldn't have gotten a minute of time. Do you know what they gave him-- Four months. Well, there was community pressure and there was public pressure in the sense that the overwhelming percentage of the population, middle America, the silent majority, wanted Lenny Bruce prosecuted and they wanted him punished because his words were offensive and because his ideas hurt the establishment and wounded the establishment. He said things that the establishment didn't want said, and for that reason I feel that there was a compulsion to prosecute him and to punish him, and we did. He didn't harm anybody, he didn't commit an assault, he didn't steal, he didn't engage in any conduct which directly harmed someone else, so therefore he was punished first and foremost because of the words that he used. (man) You're saying you feel that now. At the time, how did you feel? At the time I was given a job to do, I was wrapped up in the prosecution of it, and therefore I was oblivious of some of the things that we were doing, to him personally. Would you do it now? No. I wouldn't have anything to do with his prosecution now. Lenny said, "I really don't want to be the great wounded bird. Flying, trying to break through these weights so that we can bring free expression to everybody. I'm a guy who has to work." And by then, of course, he was bankrupt, in both the literal and monetary bankruptcy and the great spiritual depression. I think the most poignant part of that whole case was at the very end, when after unsuccessfully trying during the case to have Murtagh and the other justices listen to him do the act for which he was being penalized instead of listening to an undercover man who could barely understand his own notes reproduce the act badly, Lenny finally-- And the last time he had a chance to talk to Murtagh, pled with him, begged with him, listen to me, listen to what I'm being accused of. And Murtagh, with his customary compassion and understanding, insisted that he sit down instantly. And the whole thing weighed on Lenny enormously, and he left New York City, if I can use the cliche, broken. (Fred) An interview with Nat Hentoff toward the end revealed the effects of all the prosecutions. Lenny's old coat couldn't cover the 50 pounds he'd acquired. Gone was the snap and hustle of the stand-up comic. But even here, for a moment, Lenny was good and was able to cook. What to you would be obscene in a club, let's say, or vulgar? Uh... Ladies that tell stag jokes are obscene to me, or are drunk at parties, pick up their dress, have an eagle tattooed over here. Judges that make jokes with prisoners that are before them. We got a prominent one in New York. How cruel, to... ... wife and kids, and when I only needed $30, well, we'll give you 30 days, you dumb joke over there. Some of the things you've been saying, the man at the "New Statesman" said you're really a puritan. That you're, in that sense. Well, those people are paid well for those... I don't know, I'm not consistent, everybody's ever-changing. I... I like you and I like you, you know I genuinely like you. I am... I am what I am, I'm Popeye the sailor man, boop-boop. Why in the last year or so has the pressure been increased against you? I don't know, but stop it! I hate it. It's chic to arrest me. Why did it suddenly accelerate? Because I've gotten a little, I'm not restricting myself as much as I used to. Yeah. But aren't the cops, aside from the ones who bust you, constitute some of your best audience? Or so I've heard. Oh yes, peace officers, anyone who's been exposed to a lot of life, as peace officers are. And yeah, they think I am quite humorous. I'm very... Here's my bow, here's it. Oh! Am I out of sound? All right, excuse me, there's probably a lot of surface noise. The editor's gonna really flip out. Especially editing, try to match your cut, try to match your cut, try to match your cut, try to match your cut. That's left, that's right, okay, here. You can match this cut. (laughing) Okay, how about, I'll give you a word to cut on. Okay, here we go. Ha! Okay, you can cut on that. (Lenny playing piano) Call Hannibal Cobb. The "Look" photo quiz. Come on now, Lenny, get up. No! Do the show, Lenny. (playing piano) Get him up there, you millionaire's son. I got a half-a-million dollar sponsor. He don't wanna get up, he's laying on the floor again. Ehh, I don't want to do the show. (imitating crying) Come on, now, you're a big boy now. All right. Now what got you down here in this horse? Such an idiot, a damn idiot. He's on that stuff again. Is he on the stuff? Bring me close in on the stuff, look. Can you move in closely? I'll move in to you. I'm late today because I had to have a fix. You know what it's like out there in the jungle? Out there in the jungle, and just get them in the morning, the connection's going, give me the stuff. Give me the stuff, all right, stuff it in there. Hey, hey, get some stuff, you got it, okay, you're hooked for life. All right? I saw the play. That's disgusting. Drug addiction and homosexuality and Communism have elected more mayors, and how do you feel about that? Which one of them? The three of them. Have elected the most politicians? Yes. Drug addiction? Probably Communism or that kind of thing, that kind of plane that people don't know anything about. I just did... If you and I had no rapport, if it was a real stuffy interview, what a great single line that would be. That would-- do the interview again. (audience laughing) Ask me that again. What did I say? Do you ever get an audience that doesn't dig what you're doing or won't? Yeah, it's happening right now. We should explain the word "dig" up here. Not that you people out there in Canada are a little behind, you know? Those cars are still good, those '37 Plymouths, you take good care of 'em. Now look. Once I got a little crazy with something, with Russia. What were you gonna do to Russia? I must've been drinking a little bit. Listen, we're behind you, but we have a lot of trouble ourselves. See, we've got this fifth column going, the Indians. The American Indians, they're waiting for us, they're just waiting, daddy. The Seminoles never give up, that's their cop-out. But I wonder, you see them laughing here at the Vanguard in a supposedly hip city. Do you really think that they understand, or really care what you're saying or is it just a kind of-- Here's what it is. Comedy is, it's a true, honest art form, because you can't fake laughs in an hour show. It's like, ha-ha-ha... Ha-ha-ha, ahhhh, ahhh! I don't think you would. What it is, it's like... I try to parallel myself to any religion, but the reason that God... hits on so many different levels, he's a loving god, he's a god that just heals the sick and he's a god who'll make you burn in hell for all your sins, he's a vengeful god, he's a god you can make deals with, oh god, I promise if you do this I'll never do that again. That's right, he's any kind of god you want him to be, he's a god who stuck around a long time and Kennedy should take a tip from it, overexposure. Nobody never saw his face. Which is a good point. Are you trying to convert when you work? Oh no, not at all. I'm trying to make a buck. I'd grab it. Oh, how terrible of you. That's not my motivation of being up here. What is? To have fun. I really dig being up there. What is the particular kick? The fact that you can say this and they'll listen? No-- Or just the fact that you're working? It's fun to say a poem in front of everybody. It's just fun to get up and have everybody listen to you, and your mother and father listen, too. They finally listen to you and they don't chase you out of the room. I dance, did you ever see me dance? No. Oh, I'll show my dance. I'm gonna take this off for a moment to do the dance, that's all, then I'll put it back on again. It's the first time I've danced before an audience, it's my American folk dance. All right, am I in good now? Can you get the... All right.
