Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Mayday. ...weather outlook... Just me, Ana. Just me. Please, stay tuned for further updates and further information. The National Weather has... - Sorry. - ...just issued the following storm advisory for all areas. This is an emergency. Listen carefully to the following instructions. Severe storm warning remains in effect. Significant flooding expected. Floodwaters are usually deeper than they appear. - Proceed with caution. - Turn it back. You're gonna kill the battery. I'd like to know what's coming. - Mm-hmm. - ...per hour. And now, the area's forecast for the next 24 hours. Another storm... No more nights in the car, Ana. Mm-hmm. We'll find you someplace better. Visibility remaining poor. 'Kay? It's time. - Trunk? - They're letting you play? Shift's over. I'm the talent now. Rock star. - Still need a singer. - Don't look at me. You're a natural. I'm... I'm not that kinda girl, Dimitri. Never had much luck with the ladies. Anastasia. You look like hell. So I've heard. - Trouble? - No. No trouble. The last girl didn't make it. Or the one before that. Whoa! Whoa! Down the hatch. What's wrong, Max? Look at this. Hmm. She's a monster. Coming through! Get it all up here. Get it all on the inside. And clean yourself up. I have to look at that face. Where the hell are the lights? Everyone gather... Hurry up! God damn it! There you are. - Why aren't you ready? - We didn't expect you so soon. Please, let me show you to your table. - Follow me. - Can't believe this. Champagne for the Groom, on the double. - Who's she? - Nobody. Oh. Ana! - Yeah? - Can you go down the fuse box? Bring the power back? Thanks. Can you help me? - It's too dark. I can't see. - I can. It's okay. - Ana. - Come here. I know. It feels like a nightmare. That's normal. There she is. How beautiful. A vision. The lights are back on, and it's time for you to take your place. With me. Who do you think you are? Amateur! Leave it. I'll get it myself. No. Bring it out. Bring the swan. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Ana, it's time to wake up. Hmm? Hey? I'm here! It seems you have a following. Come on! - Hi! - Here we go. Take this. Okay? Hmm, they're getting younger and younger. Hi! You ladies with the nurses? - Birders. - Bird watchers? - Mm-hmm. Smoke? - Oh, yeah. Cheers. You see anything good? Mm-hmm. - What's with her? She's in shock. Someone scared her to death. Well, she better snap out of it. There's a war on. - Who are you? - I'm the Pilot. My plane went down on a storm. Picked up a distress signal. Came to help. No good deed. Mm-hmm. Huh. I need to find my men. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be along. Come on. Let's get moving. Let the boys do their jobs. Follow me. Bye! Come on! Hold on to me. - Where are we going? - Someplace better. Whoo! - Where are we? - The front. Where we belong. Down the hatch! - What's in there? - Your rescue party. You like parties, don't you? - No. - Well, you'll like this one. - What is this? - U-boat. All that's left of it. We took the liberty. This way! - I feel so tired. - Here. You won't need this anymore. You're in quite a storm. I'll find you something to change into. Out cold. I can't wait. Remarkable reflexes. Nice shot. That'll come in handy. Smoke? So, what brings you here? - I think I'm bird watching. - Hmm. See anything good? - A swan? It looked like a swan. - Nasty creatures. I never go near 'em. What else do you remember? Uh, there's a soldier that came out of the sky. - He's a goner. - That's enough, Beatriz. Do you remember your name? - Look. - Hmm. We'll call you Ana. Here. That's B. I'm Gert. Put this on. Hurry up. She's waiting for you. Kill the lights. You can't see anything interesting in the light. It suits you. The storm cleared the sky. Have a look. Do you see the red one? There aren't any red ones. Look further. Do you see it? That's Mars. The God of War. I'm getting dizzy. Of course, you are. You've never seen that far before. She's going down fast! Oh! - Come on! - What's happening? It's a war, Ana! Cleared the deck! Come on! We're living! - Whoo! - Live a little! Whoo! War is a bitch! Goners! Goner! What are you waiting for? Take off your clothes! - I can't swim. - Liar! I'll teach you how to float, Ana. No, I'd just sink. Not here, you won't. Come on! - You're okay. - Okay. - You're okay. You can lay back. - Okay. Here. Go ahead. I've got you. Lie back. You're good. I've got you. I've got you. - I'm floating. - You're floating. - Don't let go! - I'm never letting go. - Shoots straight. - Yeah? Yeah. Now, Ana, we got you a little present. Kind of like a birthday present. Look alive, Bea! We need a target! We need a sharpshooter, Ana. - I think you're just the girl. - I've never been in a war. You've been in a war your whole life. You just didn't know it. Do you remember what happened to you before you came here? Before the storm? - No. - It wasn't a very good story. - So, I'm giving you a new one. - Is my story that bad? So bad, you had to end it. Am I dead? Yes. Yes, you are dead, Ana, but don't panic. - Girls are better off dead. - Why? 'Cause now, we're free. You never had a chance back there, Ana. - Chance for what? - A chance to win. Come on. Girls make excellent snipers. A sniper must endure uncomfortable positions - for hours. - I'm good at that. They know how to make themselves invisible. - Yeah, I'm good at that too. - We all are. Where do I aim? Dead center. Now, you have to slow down your breathing. A heartbeat can throw off the shot. So, when my heart stops, that's when I shoot? Exactly. Now! I can always spot a natural. - When does Marsha sleep? - Marsha never sleeps. She's a force of nature. Marsha got me out of trouble. Were you in a lot of trouble? The worst. Yeah, I think I was too. It's okay. You're on our side now. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. This is the Victory. Victor, India, Charlie, Tango, Oscar, Romeo, Yankee. We're receiving your signal. Request to know if you're in distress. - Yes, I am in distress. - Stand by. Do you require assistance? Yes, I require assistance. Is your vessel disabled? We are... adrift. All right. What is your position, ma'am? There's a storm one mile south. Rising swells. - Send them to... - Ma'am? ...fifty-nine degrees, nine minutes north. Fifty-nine degrees, nine minutes north. Eight-two degrees, four minutes east. Eight-two degrees, four minutes east. That's, uh... that's a ways out, ma'am. Out of our normal range. Surprised we're picking up that signal. It's a very strong signal. Charting a course to you now. Help is on the way. How many souls on board? Mm... We don't have any souls. Correcting course... Ma'am? Ma'am, can you read me? Ma'am? Cannot read you. Please come back to us. Ma'am, I repeat, cannot read you. Our instruments are down. You don't need your instruments anymore. Ma'am, we... ma'am, we have no bearing! We... ma'am, we... We have large swells that are... We are taking on water. Our position is ten degrees south, ten degrees north. We cannot... we can't... Man overboard! We're going down! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Do you like the radio? These are our instruments. Here. - Take this. - What do I say? Mayday is our favorite. They can't resist a lady in distress. Mary... Not so loud. They like their girls softer. Less authority. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. Yankee. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Look. Do you see it? Ana, listen. Hello, all you radio listeners out there. We would like to welcome you to... I'm a little bit afraid that it might sound noisy. Little, boys. I am going to play you a little song. I hope it is one last load to your morale. A girl in every port. Ahoy, ladies. Out for a swim? - Only if the coast is clear. - Stand by. All clear. Carry on. Let's go. Woo-hoo! Look out below! What are they doing? Falling. Come on! Down to your skivvies! Oh, no, no. I don't like heights. Well, no wonder. You've always been at the bottom. Stop. Feels good to fall, you know? The further, the better. Whoop. Ana! Come on, Ana! - Don't be a pussy! - Hurry up! No! Ana! Ana! Ana! - I'm an easy target... - Never say that! You need to stop hurting yourself and start hurting others. Gert's never afraid. Gert's too thickheaded to be afraid. I mean that in the best possible way. - I'm not like you. - Yes, you are! - I don't belong here. - Yes, you do. You just can't see it yet. We shouldn't have left you alone. You weren't ready. Soon, you'll be a whole new person, the kind that men only dream about. This is an emergency. Listen carefully to the following instructions. Can you read me? Can you read me? She talks in her sleep. - What should I do? - Can you read me? Over. Answer her. Yes, I read you. Over. Can't sleep? I had a bad dream. Don't worry. All your dreams will die soon enough. Have a look at this. Is that a new one? New stars are born all the time. Some girls say, if they become too powerful, they collapse and disappear. But I don't believe that. Why not? Because it's never happened here. Pressure, altitude, temperature. Transmitting. Okay. This should do it. No, no, no! Beatriz! - What are you doing? - Sending a weather balloon. It tells us where the storms are. So, we know what's coming. Yankee. Hotel. Foxtrot. Yankee. Hotel. Yankee. Hotel... Welcome to our station. So glad you're tuning in. A storm is coming to you tonight. Expect low humidity, or worse. Our position is 93.1 north, 12.2 east. Avast, ship sailors. Now, you are going to drown. What's she saying? She's saying, "I... am... on... fire." - Blue whale. - Yeah. Iceberg. You have good ears. Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Can anybody read me? Reading you loud and clear, ma'am. - Who am I speaking with? - I'm the radioman. We picked up your signal. Do you require assistance? Yes. We require assistance. All right. Hold tight. Help is on the way. You should be careful. Things tend to lose their power around here. All the storms. We've charted a course to you, ma'am. We are... Uh, stand by. We're losing... we're losing... We need to submerge. We're gonna lose you, ma'am. Can't lose me. I'll be with you till the end. Sweet dreams. Good girl. The air is filled with sea and spray. Crests break, and... The sea is very dark. Come back again. We'll be listening. It's almost dark enough. For what? To see the stars. - Guys! Flyers! - Get back! Bea! No Go! Go, go! Everybody down! It's a dud. Sneaky bastards! - I can't see anything! - I'm shooting blind! One at ten o'clock, one at two o'clock, and two dead ahead. - What? - I can see them. - Do what she says, Gertry. - Okay, then. Get down! All clear. Okay, girls! It's time to go. - Where are we going? - Hunting. Shoot in open. Go see if there are others. Go on. Go. - Hello, soldier. - I'm an airman. Not at the moment. - Nurse? - Yes, airman? - Will you hold my hand? - Sure. - I'm not gonna make it, am I? - Shh. Don't talk like that. Can you get a message to my wife? You can give it to her yourself. - You're burning up. - Tell her that I love her. Are you sure about that? What? Are you sure you love your wife? - Of course. - Do you think she loves you? I'm not so sure. I want a real nurse! It's possible she never loved you and she feels much better without you around. Help! No more endless meals to make, filthy babies to wipe. Maybe she has better things to do now. Or maybe she's here, doing something important. Who are you? I'm a friend of your wife's. Been having dreams about my life. Gaining altitude. Bad dreams? I was living in my car. Yeah, that's pretty bad. Was that how you did it? In your car? No. I think it was an oven. A lot of girls go in an oven. Too much time in the kitchen. What about you? Take a guess. - Do you remember doing it? - No. It all goes away. I don't know why it's taking you so long to forget. You're gonna feel so much better when it's gone for good. And Marsha just remembers? Marsha remembers everything, yeah. And what about Bea? Hers was bad. We don't talk about it. Her nightmares are gone now. A lot of girls just slip away. They deserve better. But don't worry. They all get even when they get here. This is an emergency. Listen carefully to the following instructions. Ana, who is this? - He was in my dream. - Ladies... meet the man of her dreams. - Nothing! - Aw. This poor man has no weapon. I say we give him a head start, so he has a chance. - He didn't give me a chance. - I know. We're taking the higher ground. Tell him to run, Ana. Run. - Come on. Let's go. - Not yet. He needs to learn what fear feels like. What do you think, Ana? Long enough? Longer. I can't see that far. I can. You should clean yourself up. We have to look at that face. Amateur. - What are those for? - Night vision. So, I can see what's in the dark, like you. You don't wanna see that, Bea. Oh. What's the lay of the land, Gerty? This is fantastic. Look at them. They're all yours, Ana. Take the shot. Should we wake them up first? They're not even in uniform. We don't even know what side they're on. It's all the same side, Ana. Maybe we should capture some instead of kill them all. We've tried that. That was exhausting. Take the shot! Where are you going? That hurt me more than it hurt you. Where are my clothes? You don't deserve to wear the uniform. Stand by. Is anyone receiving our signal? I repeat, is anyone receiving our signal? Can you read us? Please respond. Is anyone receiving our signal? I repeat, is anyone receiving our signal? We have an electrical outage and require repairs. We are disabled. Can you read us? - Where are you? - Hello. Ma'am? How'd you find this frequency? Do you require assistance? How far are you from shore? We're not that far. Why? Come in. Come in. Are you there? Yes, ma'am. We're here. Don't come any closer. I'm swimming out. I'm coming with you. I do not advise that, ma'am! Why not? It's too dangerous. We were damaged in a storm and need to submerge. Ma'am? - Ma'am, are you there? - I'm here. Hold tight. We'll come back for you. - I promise. - You won't make it. Nothing makes it here. Who're you talking to? No one. Going for a swim. Liar. Ana! Ana! We need to go! Bea's in trouble! - What? - They got her. - What do you mean? Who? - Fliers! Okay. Come on. - Got her. - Where? At two o'clock. - Shoot, Ana. - Stop talking! Finally. Bea would never go out into the forest by herself. She would if I told her to. You couldn't. I didn't have a choice. Ana's heart wasn't in it. Now, it is. No more going out on your own. Marsha said it was a part of the plan. From now on, I make the plans. - Will you stay with me? - Gert will. In case you have nightmares. I don't want any more nightmares. - You stay. I'll go. - No. - It's easier for me. - I'll get used to it. Okay, Ana! Time to clear the decks! Where are you going? Hey. Don't! I'm just a photographer... You look familiar. - Who are you? - Get up. Come on! Where are we going? Are these your men? - Stop that. - Just one more. - Are these all of them? - I think so. You may wanna shut your eyes. What is that? Go! Move! Air. Avalanche. Cloud. Cycle. Hail. Halo. Hurricane. - Did you switch sides? - No. Just trying these on. Hey, I brought you something. From a flier. - I love them. - All right. We're resting. - Been active lately. - Mm-hmm. The wars always get out of hand. And soon, everyone will be in on it. How do you feel? - Foggy. - Ears ringing? Hallucinations? I heard music. Sleep it off. Next time, just stick with Marsha. No. I don't need her anymore. I got them all. You're not the girl that I thought you were. Oh, yeah? Who am I? You're nobody. What are you doing? I've stopped hurting myself. Learning to hurt others. You fight like a girl. Trouble? No trouble. Bea... get inside. Go! Jesus! Marsha! We need Marsha! - Go out there. - Marsha! Marsha, come down! Bea needs you. You look like hell. Sit. Sit. Where are the others? I don't know. I'm lost. Yeah, me too. I want to be someplace without a war. I don't know if there is one. Maybe we should go home. Home? I never thought of that. Thanks, Max. Hmm. Bad dream? No. Everyone dreams of something better, Ana. It doesn't mean you're gonna get it. - Where is he? - He had to go. You're a monster. Mm-hm. We're all monsters. You still fight like a girl. Thanks. Gert! Gert. I wanna go back. - To what? - To my life. Why on earth would you wanna do that? Because I had a dream it could get better. You dream too much for your own good. Please, just show me the way to go. I don't know. I wouldn't even know where to start. Gert, I know you can figure it out. Maybe it could be better. I don't think you belong here. Then, please, help me. Please. Anybody read me? Are you there, ma'am? Hope you can still hear me. Who is this? - It's good to hear your voice. - You're still here? Not for long. I'm... I'm sorry. I can't make it to you. It's just fumes down here. You know, ma'am, I... never thought it would end like this. I... I... thought I could save you. I thought I'd find you someplace better. Never had much luck with the ladies. You should get off the radio now and just... just let me go. I can't do that. Why not? Because I'm not that kinda girl. Dimitri. It's... so dark now. I'm tired. Dimitri? Come back. - It's so cold. - Come back! Please, come back. Dimitri, you need to go to sleep now. I'm not supposed to sleep on the job. Just this once. It'll slow down your breathing. - Save your air. - Huh. Yes, ma'am. That's a good idea. - Here I go. - There you go. You remember him? I remember everything. Yeah, you definitely don't belong here. We're going to need more help. There's someone I think you should meet. The following is an emergency forecast. It's time to clear the decks. There is cause for alarm. I'm coming undone. The weather outlook is threatening. There's a dark haze in the sky. Nothing is visible anymore. Even Gertrude's gone soft. It's useless. Outta gas? - Are you June? - You must be the new girl. All the stars are falling. We are below normal temperatures, and no one seems to care. - Who does she think she is? - Marsha's not herself. Why won't her dreams just die? I never heard her sound like this. I don't need gas. - What's the problem, then? - I need to go. - Okay. How far? - Far. To where I was before the storm. Why the hell would you wanna do that? Because I'm done with this. That's not what I heard. Ana. You got a smoke? Gert told me not to bring these. Gert can be a drag. Light me? Why are you all the way out here? I don't play well with others. I'm going back. I still have a friend there. I just spoke to him on the radio. What a phenomenal girl you are. And how do you imagine you'd get there? Swim. You can't swim against the currents. I'm a strong swimmer. Now I see why Marsha's been acting up. - You're outshining her. - Please. Gert said you could help us. I don't think we're seeing the whole picture. No one could see that. Would be interesting, though. You'd have to be in the right place at the right time. I always thought we'd get much farther than this. A girl gets tired of the same, old yarn. But it can't happen. Why not? You ever think about what happens to us - if you go, Ana? - No. We lose. End of story. - End of us. All of us. - No. You can't lose. - There's so many girls. - Okay. Didn't Marsha tell you what happens when a star dies? It's like that. If a star goes, everything around it gets pulled in. And we disappear. It's just the way it works. Sorry to break it to you. You're still gonna need this. - So what did she say? - I'm not going anywhere. - Why not? - I'm just not. Well, if it's about us, don't worry. - We know what happens. - Yeah. - I'll be your wingman. - No. No. If she's happy, I'm happy. You could come with me. You could come with me! - It's too late for us. - But not for you. I can't do that. I can't. I'm tired of seeing all the girls in trouble. If you go back, maybe you can help the next one. What about the girls here? Well, we asked them. Come. What is this? Music. Okay. So, when the storm is strong enough, you'll swim back the way you came. Bea's balloons will measure the storm. We'll get you to the center of it, where you'll be a little lighter, and you might be able to just slip through. You'll have to swim directly into the current. You can't be off, even by a hair. You'll have to be right on time. But I don't know when that is. Where will she be if she's not there on time? Nowhere good. Then let's make sure she's on time. ...got the lightning. Thank you. I think she might suspect something. I know what you're doing. You're going back to the kitchen. You don't need to worry about me, Marsha. I know what to do. After everything I've given you? What have you given me? I made you into a hero. - You made me into a psychopath. - It's the same thing! You won't be winning, Ana. I can live with that. You're going back to so much darkness. In the dark, I'll see the stars. Are you sure this is what you want? This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. I don't wanna leave you. Then I'll go first. Close your eyes. It's time. Go on. - I don't know how to thank you. - Up you go. Go on. Gerty, I can't do it! - I can't do it, I can't do it! - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You're a strong girl. You always were. Ana. Remember who you are. Now, go. Okay, June. Is it time? Yep. The tide's coming in. Copy that. Has anyone seen Marsha? - That's a negative. - Okay. Bea! I need your readings! Bea? - Up here! - Where? You should see it up here, Gerty. It's heaven! Beatriz, come down here right now! I have to take the readings myself. The balloons won't be accurate enough. Where did you even get a plane? I took the liberty. Gert, I have measurements. - Do you read me? - Yes, I read you. The storm is three miles out, and the wind shear is 60 knots. Central velocity... Ten, eight, 71. Conditions are good to go. This is dangerous. Please come down. I'll see you soon. This is Beatriz. Over and out. Let's give her the signal. On my mark. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... - Three... - Three... Two... Mark! - Oh, Bea! - Where's Ana? Can you see her? How far is the storm? It's here. I've got her! Yes! Yes! There she goes. Wait. That's not right. - What? - She's swimming the wrong way. - What's going on? - It's a riptide. - No. - It's pulling her under. She's too far. Help! Help me! Mayday! Mary. Alpha. Yankee. Delta. Alpha. This is an emergency. Listen carefully to the following instructions. - She can't hear you. - Yes, she can. Stay calm in a riptide. Do not attempt to fight it. Float until you feel the current weaken. Wake up. Ana, wake up! Stay afloat. Do not attempt to swim... until you feel the riptide weaken. - The wind's shifting. - She's back on course. It's over, Ana. You can break free. Good girl. These frequencies are of pure tone. The sea is very dark and very deep. Wearing my last nerves. Time for you to say good night, boys. Wow. Every good day starts with smoke and lightning.
