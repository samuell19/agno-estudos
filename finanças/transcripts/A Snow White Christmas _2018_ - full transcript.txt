Mrs. Woods! There she is! Ooh! What's this? It's beautiful! Oh, these are from our new Christmas selection. I've added candy apples this year. Ooh! Well, I hope you don't mind if I sneak one. Mrs. Woods, they're all for you. I was just on my way to come see you. Oh! Well, thank you. Of course. Your father would be so proud. I remember when I started working for him more than 30 years ago, he had the same energy for it you do. He just wanted to make people happy, especially around Christmas. It was his favorite time of the year. Made more special after you were born, his Christmas baby girl. Well, can I help you with anything? Are you picking something up? Oh, no, no, no, don't bother yourself. I can manage. I have Hunter. Hunter, this is my goddaughter, Blanca. - Hi, Blanca. - Hi. Hunter is helping with retouches around the house. He's actually a very gifted painter. Really? With a soft spot for old ladies. Well, only the very sweet ones who went to school with my grandma. Well, I'm glad you've got some help. Well, it was so good to see you. - Oh... - Hm... - Nice to meet you. - You, too. Hello? Is anybody home? Victoria? Christmas again. I must say, I never really understood the appeal. But what you're doing here, Blanca, is lovely. I mean, it's just lovely. It's so Christmassy. Your father's study sure could use some sprucing up. Oh! This is my favorite one. Dad was always so thoughtful with little things like this. Yes, he was thoughtful. Can you believe it's been a year? He loved you so dearly. Oh! Oh, no! Oh, I'm so sorry! Oh, Blanca, I'm so clumsy! I-I've destroyed your special ornament. No. It, it's-it's okay, Victoria. R-really. I-it's just an ornament. I'll have the memories forever. Please don't feel bad. Okay. I'll try. Beautiful! Darling! Mwah! Mwah! Ugh. Um... Ugh, Blanca, I see you're still cluttering up the place with decorations, too. Um, can you just keep this mess confined to one room, please? Why? What's going on? Lucas Prince is what's going on. Who's Lucas Prince? Lucas Prince is only the most-sought-after architectural designer and bachelor this side of the Mississippi. And he has graciously agreed to oversee the renovation of this beast of a house. Renovate? What do you mean? Blanca, take a look around. I mean, we're living in a relic from the Dark Ages. It's time to freshen things up a bit. But I grew up in this house. And my father renovated it a few years ago. Correct, but now I want to make this house a centerpiece for the architectural design community. I want opulence pouring out of every room. - I want it to be... - Fit for a queen. Yes. Precisely. Blanca, darling, as you yourself said, I mean, it's just a thing. A house is just a thing. And, of course, you'll always have your memories. The estate won't be finalized until my 25th birthday. That's Christmas Day. Can't we celebrate and wait until after that to discuss this? Discuss it? Honey, it's done. Blanca, there is no reason to think that the estate will be held up. Half the money will go to you, the other half will come to me. And the candy company will be officially in your name. That was your father's final birthday gift. - Still, I'd rather wait... - Blanca. Darling, opportunities are like sunsets. If you wait too long, you miss them. Oh, my God. That is beautiful! - Right off the top of my head. - Oh! And speaking of gifts, I have one for you. - For me? - Mm-hmm. Happy birthday/ Christmas. But it's three weeks away. I know, but this is the kind of gift that requires a little advanced giving. I don't understand. I thought it would be fantastic if you and I spent your 25th birthday together, someplace tropical and exotic. - You and I together? - Mm-hmm. Wow! I don't know. I've, I've never been away for Christmas. - Yawn. - I know. And I thought this Christmas might be particularly difficult to be here. And I think your father would want you and I to make some memories together, don't you, as a family? That's really thoughtful, Victoria. - So you'll go? I mean, we'll go? - Yes, of course. - We'll spend Christmas together. - Yay! And I'm pretty sure that's all that matters. What about the estate meeting with my dad's lawyer? Oh, lawyers. Oh, honey, blah. We'll work something out. Thank you. This was so sweet of you. Oh... Yay! Sweet? You are the most wicked of all. Thank you. I'm assuming everything is on track? Everything is progressing perfectly. She's not gonna see a penny of that money. A trip to far-off Fiji is just the thing to get her out of town this Christmas before the deadline. And, of course, her poor little bleeding heart just couldn't say no. He's here. Honey, you are... drop-dead. Your prince awaits, my lady. Victoria Snow. You are just as beautiful as I imagined. I mean, your beauty is simply unmatched, uh, and a style icon for the ages. Mr. Prince, you're too kind. Lucas... May I call you Lucas? Well, of course, I can call you Lucas. And, of course, you have met my assistant, Zane. He's my helper with all things fabulous. Fantastic to meet you. Let's start with the tour, shall we? I can't wait to get my hands dirty. - Yeah. - Figuratively, of course. Stop. Okay, this is the kitchen, of course, and-and it's open. But I'd like to open it up a little bit more. I'd like to do something, perhaps, a little Italian or... When, when what to my wondering eyes should appear... - Oh, no. - But, uh... This is my, uh, my stepdaughter, Blanca. Uh, moving on, moving on... I don't normally say things like this, but you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I'm sure that's not true, but thank you for saying that. Lucas Prince. It is absolutely true. You are one of a kind. Yes, like a thrift-store find. - It's nice to meet you. - Egh! Sorry, I'm late. Okay, not egh. - Hi! - Hi! - It's great to see you again. - It's good to see you, too. I'm Zane. Everyone, this is Hunter. He's an extraordinary painter. I've contracted him to do the murals you asked for Victoria. Only the best for my clients. You two know each other? Sort of. We... I-I had one of your candy apples, and it was so good that I had to go by your store and get a couple more. Wow. Thank you, really. Yeah. You really have a gift. Fascinating. Lucas, we still have so much more of the house to see. - Shall we? - Yes, of course. Bye, Hunter. Blanca, I know this is gonna seem a bit forward, but, um, can I take you out tomorrow night? Somewhere special. - Um, I... - I know. We've only just met, but it's Christmas and the city is beautiful and sparkling... just like you. Say yes. At least give me a shot at sweeping you off your feet. Sure. I'd-I'd love to. You have just made me the luckiest man in the city. Lucas, we are waiting. I'll pick you up tomorrow night at 7:00. Wear your best dress. I'll see you then. Sorry about that. What? Oh, that? Ah... I'm sure he's full of grand gestures. Well, um, don't worry about it. I'm just here to do the mural. But it is really great to see you again, Blanca. You, too. Maybe I could, uh, paint something just for you. - Mm! I'd like that. - Yeah? So, um, what do you think for the mural? Uh, Victoria's face or Zane's? You could just mix them together. I mean, they're together all the time, so both. - Perfect. - Yeah. - Victoria? - I'm in here. - A present arrived for you. - Oh! Oh! Oh, my! Hiring Lucas Prince to renovate your house is just the beginning of your fairy-tale romance. I knew he was into you. Go ahead, read the card. Thrill me. Ooh! "White roses for you, the most beautiful of all, more magical and enchanting than a Christmas snowfall. I'm honored that you'll be my date tonight... Blanca." Oh, no, sweet... Oh, no, no. No, God, no... Sweetheart, please don't... Come on, breathe. Ah... Breathe. Breathe. - Open... - Blanca? I know, I know, but, sweetheart, you, you need to keep your eye on the prize, okay? You need to focus on what is really important right now, and that is getting what you want at any cost. I hate her so much! I know, I know you do. - But you're right. - I know, I know... - You're right. - Shh, shh. I cannot afford to let myself become distracted now. I know. I mean, and besides, this can't exactly be a surprise. She is, like, you know, the most beautiful thing that ever lived. What I wouldn't give for her cheekbones. And... Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out! You like them? They're just like the flowers that I sent you before. I will never understand what he sees in her. Huh... Ugh! Tell me a story. Once upon a time there was a dim-witted lawyer who received a heartfelt letter from Blanca, the sweet daughter of a man who had recently passed away. I love this story. In this letter, Blanca signed away her half of his fortune to her beloved stepmother, the widow. Aw... Was the letter notarized? Yes. And by the way, notary school is an absolute bore. You're welcome. But you see, that's all it takes. She has until 8 p. m., December 25th, her 25th birthday, to change her mind. And then everything is mine, including Lucas. You know, it isn't something I would normally do, but I really enjoyed the ballet. It was beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome. I, uh, I actually go all the time. My family's had that private box for over 40 years. So we've made it one of our Christmas traditions. - That's so nice. - Yeah. My family and I have a few traditions, too. My dad and I used to decorate and make all different kinds of hot chocolate and he would tell me stories about my mom. She died when I was born, but his stories of her were such a big part of every Christmas time. I didn't realize. Oh. No, I-it's okay. Those memories actually inspired my idea for the new candy shop. A hot-chocolate bar. - Hm. - You don't like it? Oh, I just, I wonder if people will really go for it. I think they will. I think sometimes the simplest things in life are the best, especially around Christmas. It's the magic of the season. Blanca... you are simply magic. ♪♪ In your eyes lead me love ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell me fast there's something about the... ♪♪ You know, between you and the snow, this is a beautiful night. You know, I was actually named Blanca because it snowed the day I was born. Well, then I'm glad it snowed. Lucas, tonight was just... I know. It's just what happens when we're together. I've never met such a beautiful match for me. We look good together, we make sense. Can we make it two in a row again tomorrow night? You certainly are fearless. I just know what I want. I promise something simpler. I just have so much to do at the store before I leave. I wish I was staying in town for Christmas. What? Where are you going? I, I thought we could spend the holiday season together, really celebrate in style. I'm not done romancing you. We've only just begun, dear Blanca. I know. I-I wish I could spend Christmas at home and with you. I... It was just such a sweet gift from Victoria. I try to hang on to any gesture that I can get from her. Let me see if I can work some magic on Victoria. I'll assure her that I'll keep the house renovations on track and, and you'll be taken care of. You would do that for me? Of course. I would do anything to see you again. Well, in that case, I would love to stay. ♪♪ Snowflakes falling in the air... ♪♪ Where are we going? Almost there. And, here. What's going on?

A friend of mine employed a new-age hypnotist to keep her husband from running after his very attractive secretary, and it worked! Uh, so this woman, for a price, can be very effective, very permanent. For even more money, she can be very discreet. Have I ever told you that you are my hero? Many, many times. We're going to make her forget everything and everyone, except her dear departed daddy. The money, the company, you, me. - Everything important. - Gone. And where do I want her to go? Um, away? You know, I've always had my eye on her room. Lucas can make it perfect for me. Consider it done. Oh, wow! What is all of this? Well, since you're now going to be here for your Christmas birthday, I thought why not throw you a party. Ms. Raven is the party planner extraordinaire. She is the best of the best. Hm. You didn't have to go through the trouble, Victoria. - Snooze. - Nonsense. Sweetheart, it's your special day. Zane, could you please go check on anything? Of course. Uh, Blanca, have fun. Mm... Please, have a seat. This is so sweet of you, Victoria. Anything for you. When I plan parties, I believe you should be surrounded by things you love and make you happy. What makes you happy? Well, people make me happy. Perfect. What else? I like simple things, really. Simple makes you happy? Think of one of your favorite Christmas birthdays. Five. Well, my dad and I got out of the city. Good. What else? Four. We stayed in a cute, little hotel. A simple motel. Three. Hi, I need to cancel two plane tickets to Fiji. We always made hot chocolate. Because your father couldn't afford anything else. Two. Nothing fancy. You don't like fancy. And one. You will wake up in a motel. The only things you will remember are the simple things you loved to do with your father. You'll want to live in this town you wake up in. You will not remember your inheritance. You will be content in your new world. You will run away and never come home again. Oh. Oh, I know. Yeah. No, they were supposed to cheer someone up. You will forget everyone but your late father. You will forget his money and business, remembering only the simple memories of him. Counting back, when I get to one, the spell will begin. Three... Turns out she doesn't need cheering up anymore, no. You will have no memories of this session. Two... Oh, yeah, well, she met, like, the man of the century. Mm-hmm. Yeah, seems he just snapped her right out of her funk. None of this ever to be remembered again. Well, true love breaks all spells. One! What just happened? Well, it can't be that bad. Well, the spell's been cast, but now there's a stipulation. True love will bring back all her memories, returning her to exactly who she was ten minutes ago. Oh, no, no, no, no! No! No, no! She can't come back here, at least until after Christmas. She has to stay away that long. And she certainly can't fall in love. Remind me again why I keep you around? Bad time to tell you that the tickets to Fiji are non-refundable. Raven, this is where you earn your keep. If you want your big payday, you need to tell us how to salvage this situation. There is nothing to salvage. The spell has been cast. Bring her to the Spessart Motor Lodge. Ring the chime three times and make yourself scarce. When she wakes up, she'll believe she belongs there, remembering nothing but her father and her Christmas memories. As long as true love does not cross her path, the deal is done. Well... here goes nothing. Oh. Hi. I was just... There was nobody at the front. I'm sorry. I'm Hap. Hi, I'm Blanca. This is my family's place, and my cousin who normally runs it goes on vacation every year I come here. - So you're staying here? - Yes, indeed. I'm with a traveling band. We come here every Christmas. We're called The Holly Jollies. We specialize in Christmas cheer. We have a residency at the Diamond Grill here in town. It's all Christmas music all night long. - What a fun job. - Yes, indeed. Now, your room has been paid for in full for the next month by your friend that dropped you off. You must be tired from your ride, I can imagine. Why don't you get some rest? I'll be by in the morning with my favorite coffee and I'll answer any questions you have about town. That actually sounds perfect. Great. I'll see you in the morning. Okay. Hap, you were right. This coffee is delicious. I've never tried a Christmas brew, but you're right, it's amazing. Well, I'm glad you showed up or I would have had to finish it all myself. I'm also glad I gave it a green light to bring your Christmas magic to this place. Yeah. Blanca, um, what's your story? It's all kind of a blur, really. - I think I just needed the rest. - Hm. I mean, the holidays are my favorite time of the year, but it's my first Christmas without my dad. - Hm. - I guess... You could say I'm a bit lost. But why Spessart? I don't really know. But my father always said, "Follow your heart's direction. It's the best driver you've got." That's a perfect perspective and great advice. Hap? Yeah, come on in. It's time for rehearsal. Yeah. Yeah, Jeez. - Oh, hello there. - I lost track of time. But, Blanca, this is Doc, our manager extraordinaire. It's short for Dakota. It's nice to meet you, Blanca, and welcome. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, too, Doc. - I'm really happy to be here. - Well... This place has seen better days, but we feel like it's our home away from home this time of year. And by the looks of it, you're gonna make this place sing Christmas for us. - Mm, mm. - That's the plan. But speaking of singing Christmas, we've gotta run. We've got a new set to run through and the band is waiting. I got you, Doc. She's the boss. Blanca, I hope you can come see our show tomorrow night. Oh, I wouldn't miss it. Great. We will see you then. Hey, we needed someone to come around here and make this place feel like home. I think I needed a place to call home. Thirty eight. Twelve. Thirty nine. Thirteen. F-forty. Oh. O-M-G. I put an alert on Blanca and she just came up. She's hash-tagging herself. Pathetic. - Blanca's crafting. - Gag. Oh. - Who's that? - Lucas. Looks like he won't be able to make it tomorrow. He's not tracking her, is he? No. No. Definitely not. Probably not. No? You better hope not. Hold my feet. Not with your scrawny arms. Sit on them. Seventy five. Fifteen. Blanca? Blanca? Sweetheart? Are you here? - Can I help you? - I knew I would find you. Why did you leave? Were you taken? - Excuse me? - Who's there? - Come out wherever you are! - Who are you talking to? Is the monster who took you here? Um... Oh, my God. - This place looks like prison. - Who are you? You can't just barge in here. You just left in the middle of the night. But then I saw your post and I knew, I knew it was your signal to me. Okay, you need to leave. But I, I came to rescue you. I have no idea who you are and I certainly don't need rescuing. Maybe you've hit your head. Sweetheart... Don't call me that. I didn't hit my head. Well, something has happened to you. - Do you remember Victoria? - Who? - Zane? - W-what's that? Your father? Of course, I remember my father. Most importantly, do you remember the name Lucas Prince? No. I don't know that name. I am Lucas Prince. You and I are in love. Does most eligible bachelor in Architectural Digest ring any bells? Maybe the stress of the season? Something has caused you to lose your memory. Okay, if you know me, tell me something you know about me. That's what I thought. Wait, um, no. The stories your father told about your mother every Christmas. It was a white Christmas the day you were born and that's why you're called Blanca. How do you know that? Because you, beautiful Blanca, you told me. Wait, what you're saying doesn't make sense. - Why don't I remember you? - I don't know. But we can find out together. Let's go home. No! I am home and I don't know you! What do you remember about yesterday before you arrived here? I, I don't, I don't know. See? Something is wrong. Please let me help you. Just talk to me. Okay. Um, I'll meet you for coffee tomorrow. Okay. At least let me put you up in some more suitable lodging. I like it here. Okay. This is worse than I thought. Okay. Okay. I'll go, but I won't go far. I'll book a space that I saw on my way in. More five-star, if you know what I mean. Do you know, my love? Please, just call me Blanca. Okay. Um, until tomorrow, my... Blanca. Whoa! - Oh, no! - Oh, yes. - But she won't remember him. - Well, of course, she won't. But you've witnessed his charm. He's irresistible. It's only a matter of time before he woos her all over again. Oh, his wooing. We've got to send someone else up to keep an eye on her, to distract her, to prevent her from falling in love with Lucas all over again. It would be good if there was somebody already on the payroll. Hm. Hunter? Hunter? Hunter! Yeah? Darling, it seems our dear Blanca's gotten herself into a bit of trouble. - What kind of trouble? - Well, apparently... She's got a sort of stress-induced amnesia. Now, Lucas has gone to bring her home, but it was his insisting that she stay home for Christmas, in the first place, that brought this amnesia on. - Amnesia? - I know. Well, we're simply worried that any attempt to bring her home might make it permanent. Now, Lucas is a dear and he means well, but he really has to be reigned in. Yes. What do you need me to do? Love this so much. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming out tonight. That one was dedicated to our new friend, Blanca. We'll be back for round two of your Christmas favorites. We are The Holly Jollies. Stick around. - You guys are so good! - You made it! I'm so glad you're here! Let me introduce you to the group. Hey, everybody, this is Blanca. Blanca, these are The Holly Jollies. - Hello. - That's Zee. Once I saw her fall asleep in the middle of a song and wake up on beat. Amazing. Bless you. Uh, yeah. Uh, that's true. He's not contagious, he's just allergic to, uh, pine trees and poinsettias. I don't know. And this is Natalie. - Also known as Nat. - Hello. She's our resident tambourine player. And this is Oscar. Pay him no mind. That's Tim, our sound guy and bass player. - And this is the crew. - Well... It's so good to meet all of you. You guys are seriously so good. The crowd loves you. They've been good to us throughout the years. But we need to go with Doc and look over our playlist. And I don't think you'll be alone too long. - Wait, don't go. - You'll be fine. - Hi. - Hi. Do we, uh, know each other? Not that I know of. - Is anyone sitting here? - It's all yours. One Christmas Irish coffee, right? Yes. Thank you. I'm Hunter. Hi, I'm Blanca. Nice to meet you, Blanca. So do you, uh, come here often to watch The Holly Jollies? - They're really good. - Yeah, they are. Um, no, this is actually my first time. I just moved here, like, yesterday and that's when I met Hap, the lead singer. And you remember that from yesterday? Yes, all the way from yesterday. Huh. Right. That's cool. So where did you move from? Um, from out of town. - Hm. - How long have you lived here? Actually, I'm just here for the holiday. - Oh, do you have family here? - Nope. No family to spend it with at home? No, not really. So I thought I'd do something a little different this year. What about you? Tsk. No family to spend it with anymore. Oh, they're going back on. Cheers. - This has been really fun. - Yeah, it has. It's getting late. I should probably get going. Okay. Hey, can I see you again? - Yeah. For sure. - Okay. How about, uh, coffee tomorrow? Um, I'm busy during the day. But how is tomorrow evening? - Did you just ask me to dinner? - Maybe. Wow. My answer is yes. - I could pick you up at 7:00? - Perfect. - Okay. - Okay. I'll see you then. Yeah. Hm. Your signature white rose. What, what do you mean? White roses are so us. I-I'm sorry. What? That's okay. Really, it's fine. Um, we can start over. It'll be our own classic Love Story Part Two. So, uh, tell me how I know you? Uh, Victoria hired me to... I'm sorry, I-I don't know who Victoria is. Could you, could you tell me something about you? Well, let's see. Uh, I'm a very successful architect. I've been featured in a number of national magazines. I'm also quite well known for, uh, being a very eligible bachelor until I met my perfect, beautiful match... you. Okay, you know, I'm, I'm gonna go with this because you seem to know things about me that I can't remember. Um, so far I hear that you're a, a big deal, and a ladies' man, and... apparently, dating me? If-if I'm gonna believe all of this, I need you to at least tell me something about you, as a person. As a person? I mean, I-I would like to think I was attracted to more than what you just described. Well, uh, we enjoyed the good life together. I love the ballet and I took you and you thought it was beautiful. - The ballet? - Yes. For fun? I mean... I mean, that-that doesn't really sound like something I would be into. You know, I'm gonna go, I... No! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Uh, our favorite time together was when I rented out a cafe and you made all different kinds of hot chocolate, just like you and your father would do. You, you did that for me? As I've always said, nothing is too grand for you. So w-what was your favorite kind? - My favorite? - Mm-hmm. Uh... it was very clever. White-chocolate Christmas. That was my dad's favorite. Yes, it was. You see, we're connected. Please, let me take you to dinner, the finest this town has to offer. And we can figure it out. I can help you. I-I can't do dinner tonight, but, um, but I'll meet you here again tomorrow. I just... I need time to really make sense of all of this. - Of course, of course. - And I'm, I'm gonna just... I will meet you anywhere, anytime. I have to make some work calls tonight. But I'm at the Diamond Cliffs Resort if you need anything. Thank you. Thank you. Victoria, I have found her. What do you mean, you found her? Well, it sounds like she doesn't wanna have anything to do with you. No. No, it's genuine. It's the strangest thing. She doesn't even remember anything about me. It sounds like she's playing a game with you. Do hurry back, won't you, darling? Have I mentioned how flawless your injections look today? - Don't. - You're gonna look 16. Well, well, 25. Yes, yes. Well, 25 sounds better. - I like it. - Real 25. Oh, shut up. - Oh, my gosh. You look frozen. - Hey. Yeah. Ooh. - Partially, yeah. - Wow! Oh, it's getting really bad out there. I, I hate to say it, but we-we should probably cancel. The roads look really terrible, and, okay, something smells crazy good in here. You know what? I baked some cookies. Do you wanna help me decorate them? Yeah. You're sure? I am. Unless you're worried about being stranded. Not unless you're worried about me eating all your cookies. - No, I'm just staying next door. - Perfect. I'll show you what smells so good. All right. - Nice job. - Thank you. Hey, those aren't for you. I didn't think that I could love anything more than your candy apples, but these cookies are so good. You haven't tried my candy apples. Right. Yeah. No, I meant, uh, the idea of your candy apples. - Oh. Thanks. - Yeah. You know, the coffee shop wants a dozen of them. And if they sell tomorrow, they'll want more. Oh. Wow. You are pretty impressive. So how does somebody like you not have a boyfriend? I guess, I just, I haven't met the right person. Hm. So what's the real reason you're here? - What do you mean? - Well... There has to be some reason you're not home, besides just the dart-on-a-map story. Well, recently I lost somebody I cared for. So I thought that maybe if I came here, it would make them seem closer somehow, and make some new memories. I'm so sorry. That's tough, especially around this time of year. I actually lost my dad last year, so I know how it feels. I never knew my mom, but my dad and I loved Christmas. Are you ready for this? Well, I don't know if I'm ready, but hit me with it. Okay. I love Christmas because I was born on Christmas. - No way. - Mm-hmm. All right, you win. Being born on Christmas is pretty amazing. My dad thought so, too. He used to dedicate the entire season to me. I really miss him, but I guess it's time I make some of my own memories. Yeah. That makes us two of a kind. Good morning, beautiful. These are for you. Thank you. Um, they're pretty. - Um, I have some good news. - You're starting to remember? Sorry, no. I, I made a dozen candy apples last night. And they just this minute sold out. That's great, really. Um, but you were building on a candy empire at home, so... Well, I don't know about a candy empire there, but I'm proud of what I've done here. Of course, and you should be. You're amazing at everything you do. And you're the most incredible woman I've ever been matched with, the only woman I ever felt was up to my standards. Oh. Thank you, I guess. Lucas, you make me sound like a checklist for your standards. Could I take you to a doctor, please? This could be serious. Can you stop saying that? I'm perfectly fine. I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm trying to make sense of it all. I've spoken with Victoria. She's worried sick. Who is Victoria? You keep mentioning her. - She's your stepmother. - What? No, m-my father never remarried. But he did. And that's how you and I met. And these are the things we need to talk about, but over dinner, not here. Okay. Okay. - How is 7:00? - 7:00 is perfect. Anything you want is perfect. All right. I'll see you then. Okay. Maybe we can find answers together. And, please, keep an open mind. The people you can't remember are the only family you've got now. Okay. - Fancy meeting you here. - Hey! Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. What are, what are you doing here? Well, I came for a coffee and a candy apple. Well, they still have coffee, but they just sold out of my candy apples. That's great! How many do they want now? Three dozen for tomorrow. I'm so impressed. You sure you're all right? Yeah. I just... I'm having a hard time remembering my life before I came here. I mean, I-I remember my dad and-and big-picture stuff about myself, but there's somebody here who's telling me I'm missing big chunks of my life. It's really freaking me out. Well, that is super weird. You know, I've heard of a certain kind of amnesia caused by stress. Maybe you should be careful with this someone. He could be a part of the problem. I just don't know. I'm genuinely worried about you. And you're really special. I don't want you to get hurt. - Maybe you should see someone. - You know... I would appreciate if everybody would stop saying that to me. I'm sorry. Let's forget I even said it. Hey, I have an idea I would love to run by you. Um, can you come to the lodge tomorrow afternoon? The lodge is becoming my favorite place to be. Great. See you tomorrow. Okay. I'll see you then. Okay. - Oh, no! - What? - White roses. - Oh. Ugh. Ugh. Well, at least she is happy there. Just because Blanca does not want to come home does not mean that Lucas is going to give up. He's enamored with the girl for some strange reason. - Beautiful eyes, perfect skin... - Stop. Okay. I just have to make sure that he comes back. After all, it's only a few more days until Christmas. I can't lose everything now. Uh, I can't reach. Thank you. So Lucas says I know him from before. And you don't remember him? I mean, not only do I not remember him, but he says I have a stepmother I don't remember. What's wrong with me? Well, that's certainly strange. I mean, you lost your dad this time last year. So could it be stress-related? How about that nice young man that paid for your month here? I found this on the floor of the lobby. Um, no one's claimed it. Uh, maybe he dropped it. Does it ring a bell? I don't know. - Let's pick this up later. - All right. More flowers! Thanks, Lucas. Come on in. Um, Hap, Lucas. Lucas, Hap. - Hap. Hap is it? - Yeah, yeah, Hap. How do you know Blanca? Oh, we met the first day I moved here. Yeah, we just hit it off. We a surrogate family along with the gang. Gang? - I'm in a band. - Oh. You all should come to the show tonight. Oh, you could stay for dinner when it's quiet and then you could hang out for the music. Oh! Thank you. That sounds very nice. But, no, uh, we have reservations at the only decent restaurant in town, so... I think it sounds like a great plan, Hap. I love The Holly Jollies. Excuse me. Just one second. I have to take this. Darling Victoria, how are you? Lucas, my darling. When might we expect you to grace us with your presence again? Well, I'm a little bit tied up trying to get our girl to come home to us. I've already told you, Lucas, she's staying put. I simply can't give up. She's far too important to all of us. Yes, darling. She means the world. But I have paid you to give this house your best efforts. I made some calls and Architecture Today wants to do a cover story on you. I've chased a cover story for years. Well, that's just one of the benefits of working with me. But it's contingent on this house being done quickly. Are you understanding me, Lucas? You make a very good argument. Um, how about this? If I can't convince Blanca to come home with me tomorrow morning, then I'll leave without her. Darling, let's not force her to return if she's happy there. Victoria, calm down, please. You call the magazine to put them on notice. If you return alone as soon as possible, you can consider it done. Wait till you see... Oh! Hm. Well, darling, The Jolly Hollies it is. - You mean it? - Yes. Your wish is my command. - All right. - Awesome. ♪♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪♪ I just, I need to think about everything you told me.

Lucas, you're really great. I just think that you and I are too different. And whatever I left behind, maybe it was for the better. What you left behind, most people can only dream of. I'll have to take your word for that. Well, I'll give Victoria your best and I'm sure you'll call me crying when you realize your mistake. Take care, Lucas. Hey, Zane. We just heard from Lucas. He is on the road coming back. Oh, okay. Uh, but why do you sound excited to see him? I thought he was really bothering Blanca. What does it matter? She is not an issue anymore. You mean, he's not an issue anymore? Nitpicky much? Okay, it's over. - Life goes back to normal. - Better than normal. So what do we do about getting Blanca home? Get her back home? No! We don't want her to come back home. Uh, push her now and it could be dangerous, you see? So we're just gonna leave her there. But you, you should get right on home now because, uh, your work is done. I think I'm gonna stick around, actually. Uh, I like it here. Whatever. Uh, live it up.

I know, but I want you to have this one early. Did you paint this? Oh, my gosh. It's amazing. You're amazing. I mean, look at you. You came here on your own, you made a ton of friends who love you, you have great business ideas that make people happy. You're a Christmas miracle. You... you make me feel like I can do anything. Is everything okay? Um... Uh, this-this was perfect, beyond perfect. I just... I think I'm starting to remember things that happened before I left. I'm really confused. Is there anything I can do? I don't, I don't think so. Um... I think I just need to be alone. Of course. Are you sure you'll be okay on your own? Yeah. Thank you. I'll see you in the morning. Victoria Snow. You're sure Blanca wants no part of her father's estate? He was very adamant that she be taken care of. Yes. He loved her so... Excuse me. She just wants to make her own way. It's all right here in her own words. Okay, well, just to reiterate, if she changes her mind... Well, she won't. She has until 8 p. m. Christmas night. - To claim her share. - Oh, believe me. My one wish is that she shows up. We're throwing a party. Hopefully, she will change her mind. You'll be there, of course. I will, and we can finalize everything then. Wonderful. Well, then, we'll see you tomorrow night. I have a meeting. Excuse me. Thank you. - Yuck. - Ugh. Ooh. Well, check and mate. Tomorrow night, everything is mine. Ugh. It's Hunter. Hunter, I thought I broke up with you. Wait. What? What, what, what? Blanca wants to come to the city. Well, you have to keep her there until the day after Christmas. It doesn't matter why. Give me the phone. Yes, I know that I agreed to keep an eye on her, but if... I'm just trying to update you, if you'd stop yelling. Oh, so this is about money now? Okay, so just how much money is your stepdaughter worth to you, Victoria? I expected more than that even from you. Okay, clarify that for me. So you want me to stall and keep her here until the day after Christmas? Listen, Victoria. I would say that I mean no offense, but you've insulted my integrity and you've asked me to be a part of your manipulations. This whole set-up is a lie. You lied to me and you lied to Blanca. I would never take a penny of your money. And quite frankly, I don't think you deserve a penny of the Snows' money, either. Listen, you. You keep her there or I'll just tell Lucas that you went up there to keep her away from him. That happens, you're out of a job at best. At worst, we ruin your reputation and you're out of a career. Okay? I also don't think Blanca would be too keen on the idea that you've been sneaking around for me. Your threats don't scare me. I can see that you're lying. I don't care if Blanca hates me as long as she knows the truth because I actually care about her unlike you. This game you're playing is over. What happened? We picked the one person who couldn't be bought. So what do we do now? We move ahead as planned. That little shrew isn't going to stop me now. Hap? Doc? Anybody? - Blanca, need to talk to you. - I don't wanna hear it! - You lied to me! - Wait, what? I heard you on... I-I know you from before! I heard you on the phone with Victoria. She's paying you to keep me here. No! No. I mean, you're right, I-I do know you and I was keeping an eye on you, but it's not what you think. - They said you were in trouble. - Who did? - Victoria and Zane. - Of course! - Of course, you're in with them. - No, I... - I-I'm not... - You know... I have a boyfriend named Lucas. - So please just go. - Blanca... Just get out. Please, please leave! ♪♪ It gets so cold this time of year ♪♪ ♪♪ And I am frozen ♪♪ ♪♪ Now that you're not here ♪♪ ♪♪ 'Cause something's missing I can feel it in my bones ♪♪ ♪♪ Why call it Christmas if we're both alone? ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm so lost in this weather ♪♪ ♪♪ Only you make me better ♪♪ ♪♪ It's Christmas time ♪♪ ♪♪ And all I want is you another treat ♪♪ - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! What are you guys doing here? Come on, everybody. Let's go in... Heh-heh. Yeah, yeah. No, no, t-take care. - No, I don't wanna see him. - Just hear him out. He called us. He's the reason why we're all back. I knew you before. Not well, but we had a connection. So when Victoria and Zane said that you lost your memory, I came here to try to keep you safe. They made it sound like you were in danger. Because they put me under some kind of crazy spell. Why didn't you just tell me the truth? Because I didn't know the whole truth. I tried to find the right time to tell you, but I just found out yesterday that they just wanted me to keep you here, not protect you. I told Victoria I wouldn't do it then she tried to bribe me and she tried to threaten me. Because she wanted to keep me away from the house. Victoria has never been one to share, but this was over the line. I'm going home to deal with it once and for all. I'm sorry I wasn't upfront with you. I really thought I was keeping you safe and then we got close and I-I got afraid to lose you. I thought that'd be the worst thing. But seeing you hurt because of something I did, that's the worst thing. And I'm so sorry. They lied to you. Victoria has a way of manipulating things so you have no idea what's going on. I know that more than anyone. She had me hypnotized so I would forget everyone, including her. Well, if I learned anything from them, I'd guess it has to do with money. Wait. Today's my birthday. That's right. Happy birthday, and a Merry Christmas. No, w-we're supposed to split the estate tonight and I inherit the candy business. Tonight at 8:00, according to the will. Victoria's gonna steal all of my dad's money and my company. Well, we have to stop her. If we leave just now, we could still make it. Sounds like y'all need backup. - What are we waiting for? - Hap, it's Christmas. Christmas is all about taking care of the people that you love. You are important to all of us. And this is what The Holly Jollies do, especially on Christmas. Doc's right. This is what people do for the people they love. Even if you can't forgive me, at least let me help make this right. - Let's go teach them a lesson. - Right. Well, looks like she's not going to show up. Well, as I said before, my beautiful stepdaughter is forging her own path. Hm. I guess we can finalize this. Thank you. Victoria! Hurry! Stop! Darling! You've come back to me. No. Sorry, Lucas. I got caught up in the fantasy of things you had to offer me. That's not the real me. And it's good that the second your true colors became clear to me, you had already run back to Victoria. It's not happening between us, not now, not ever! Ooh. You should be ashamed of yourself, Victoria. You had me hypnotized so I would forget everything my father worked so hard to accomplish. Also, you could pull it out from underneath me. You know, it's interesting, I never figured you for the materialistic type, Blanca. You mean, like you, Victoria? I'm not. But I certainly won't sit by while you destroy everything my father worked so hard for, all in the name of your own selfish vanity. - Oh, cry me a river... - Sit down, Zane! Boo-hoo-hoo. Fine. So you get your half of the estate. Who cares? Mrs. Snow, you've committed fraud. Not only is it illegal, but there are clear stipulations in the will that in the case of fraud, you forfeit your portion of the estate. What! Blanca, just sign right here and it's all yours. No! You can't get everything! You always get everything! My father loved you, Victoria. He loved Christmas and he wanted us to make new memories together, to be a family. Lucky for you, he was a very forgiving man, so I'm-I'm not gonna press charges. I have bigger plans for you. Oh? Like what? Hm. It's Christmas, Victoria. Let's let it be a surprise. You know, you're as beautiful as ever. You really think so? Have you ever seen New Year's Eve from the top of the Eiffel Tower? - With the entire Moscow Circus. - Oui? Well, I guess everything's kinda calmed down now. I-I should probably get out of your way. I know that after everything, you probably don't want me around, so... Yeah, I was really hurt. And I wish you would've just been upfront with me from the very beginning. I mean, I-I understand the evil web of Victoria and Zane. I really do. I just thought more of you. I'm so sorry. But then I remembered the only thing that could break the hypnotist's spell. And I remembered how I felt about you. And there was only one thing that could make me remember all of this. True love. - The kiss of true love. - Really? If it wasn't for you staying and not telling me why you were there, I-I would have never remembered. And Victoria would have won. You gave us time to fall in love. - True love. - Mm-hmm. Like this? Just like that. You are the feeling I've been missing at Christmas. I'm so lucky I found you. I think we're both pretty lucky. The luckiest. Well, what I thought was gonna be the worst day ever turned out to be the best birthday ever. Your birthday. Uh, I have something for you. - Really? - Yeah. Hunter, it's beautiful. There's a saying, "People are like snowflakes. No two are alike." You, then, are the most unique and loving person that I've ever met. And I wanted you to have something to remind you of that. I love you, Blanca. I love you, too, Hunter. Best birthday ever. Best Christmas ever. I just wanna thank you for an incredible Christmas. You guys! How can I thank you? Well, you can grab a drink and celebrate with us. Let's all raise a glass and toast to the lady of the house, the beautiful Blanca. Happy birthday, baby. I can't tell you how much each of you mean to me. Even you, Oscar. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Now let's party! - Hm. Merry Christmas! How many more of these dreaded candy apples are left for today? This is the last of them. She's taking it easy on us because it's Christmas Eve. Still no word from Lucas? Apparently, candy-store workers aren't his thing. Ah. Hey, hey. You are still beautiful. Oh, boy. Okay, come on. Let's finish these up and get you home. I wanna thank you all for joining us on this very, very special night. To our newlyweds, Blanca and Hunter. Let's all raise our glass and give it up for our favorite couple.
