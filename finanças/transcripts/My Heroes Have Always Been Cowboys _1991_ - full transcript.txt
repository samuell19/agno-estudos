RODEO ANNOUNCER: San Antonio Days, cowboy saddle bronc riding is an event that we saw starting out on the open range many, many years ago. The cowboys got together [INAUDIBLE].. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the most dangerous event we have in rodeo, wild bull riding. [INAUDIBLE] Get in there. Get his hand free. Watch it. [INAUDIBLE] Watch him there. RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]. They did get the cowboy loose. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give those two rodeo clowns and bullfighters a big round of applause if you would, please? [INAUDIBLE] The clowns and the cowboy are doing great. Ladies and gentlemen, that little ruckus down in the bucket shoot is none other than that legendary bull Thunderbolt. [INAUDIBLE] that's going to be performing for you. This is a bull that's never been ridden. No one really knows where this bull came from. About five years ago some very severe destruction came through the owner's ranch, [INAUDIBLE] an enormous young bull came walking out from this real heavy rain, [INAUDIBLE] and stayed. Later this bull was named Thunderbolt. [INAUDIBLE].. Remember, this bull has never been ridden, ladies and gentlemen. The only one in the rodeo that has never been ridden. So let's [INAUDIBLE] welcome Mr. Hank Peterson, San Antonio, Texas cowboy, home of [INAUDIBLE] in shoot number five today. [INAUDIBLE] OK. [CHEERING] RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE] let's give a big round of applause [INAUDIBLE]. a bull like that. You two [INAUDIBLE] better watch out. He will definitely horn in on your business. Here, boy. Here, boy. Give me his arm. You just hold his head, still traction on his neck. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, I know you're all concerned about this cowboy. That's HD Dalton, folks, one of our top bull riders. He was just filling in for a buddy today playing the clown. Looks like it was his unlucky day. Keep it straight as possible. RODEO ANNOUNCER: We hope he only has the breath knocked out of him, but as you saw, he took a pretty bad hooking. We'll keep you posted as soon as the paramedics get information back up to us, and we'll be bringing his condition back to you just as soon as it's available to us. Once again, as the ambulance leaves, let's put our hands together. Perhaps he can hear us in the ambulance. Let's let him know what we appreciate what a fine effort this young man made to get this cowboy out of the way and try to keep him from having injuries himself. [SIRENS] Nope. Do you know your name? HD. Great. Are you hurting anywhere? Yeah, everywhere. Get this damn makeup off. OK, wait, sir. Just a minute. Just a minute. OK, I'll wipe that off. You just need to relax. [MUSIC - WILLIE NELSON, "MY HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS"] I grew up dreaming of being a cowboy and loving the cowboy ways. Pursuing the life of my high riding heroes, I burned up my childhood days. I learned all the rules of a modern day drifter, don't you hold on to nothing too long. Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them with the words of a sad country song. My heroes have always been cowboys. Good as new. [MUSIC - WILLIE NELSON, "MY HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS"] Still are, it seems. Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of themselves and they're slow moving dreams. Sadly, in search of, and step in back of themselves and they're slow moving dreams. Anybody home? Hello? Dad? Jeeter? Here, boy. Hey, HD, where you been hiding? I've been around. Hi, darling. HD, look at you. Mr. Hornby? Look who's here. I'll call you right. Whoa. Good golly, Miss Molly. Look what the cat drug in. How are you? Does Cheryl know you're here? Uh-uhn. Well, you just missed her 15 minutes ago, and she's not going to be back till late afternoon. Where's Dad? You went by the house? Yeah, nobody there. Well, he's at Chillicothe. What the hell's he doing there? We thought it would be best. He's just not himself anymore. We. Come by the house tonight for dinner. Cheryl... sweet thing, would you please get my wife on the phone right now? [MUSIC - JIM REEVES, "BILLY BAYOU"] Back about 1800 and some, a Louisiana couple had a redheaded son. No name suited him, Jim, Jack, or Joe, so they just called him Billy Bayou. Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go. You're walking on quicksand. Walk slow. Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say. A pretty girl look at you one of these days. Billy was boy, kind of big for his size, red hair and freckles, and big blue eyes. 13 years from the day he was born, Billy fought the battle of Little Big Horn. Billy, Billy Bayou. Hello? Can I help you? Jesse Dalton's room. Room number one, first one on the right. Thanks. TV EVANGELIST: All right, thank you, Donna. You need that. You'll enjoy it, you'll love it. Now... Junior? Hm? Hey. Hey, Junior. Hey, there, Hank. Hey, how you been doing? Okey dokey. Okey dokey. Them nurses, they're mean. Really? We'll just have to see about that. TV EVANGELIST: Heaven and the earth calling into existence now. The heavens and the earth here. We understand that the worlds were framed, not with things which do appear, Paul says. Angels ruled in reigned back here. The person we know of is Lucifer in Isaiah the 14 chapter. Pictures his downfall. I didn't know you were such a Dolly Parton fan, Junior. Yes, I love her. Fine Christian lady. That's why the Lord blessed her with such abundance. She sings a song in every show she does, a religious song, and it's not for show. She does it from her heart. You know what I mean? Where's my daddy, Junior? Oh, he's outside. Where, out there? He's playing with them birds. I'll see you later, Junior, all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you later. TV EVANGELIST: Laid the foundation of this earth. So your read in the beginning, God created it all into existence. What you doing up there? Just trying to stay above the crowd. What are you doing down there? Just trying to get by without shoving. So how you've been doing? I have been making it. No use complaining. You been gone a long time. Yeah, I've been chasing them white lines on the highway. You know the worst thing about getting old? No, sir. Getting old. You've seen Cheryl? No, sir. I'm supposed to go over there tonight for dinner. Food in here is like pasteboard, but most these goats in here don't taste or smell, so it don't make any difference anyway. So where you been? On down the road. Honky tonk life, huh? So why are you here? Figured I'd take a break. You're hurting or you wouldn't be here. Yeah, a little bit. Looks like you're doing a first class job of wrecking yourself. Well, thanks. And why you walking funny? It's how I walk. I'm sorry, if you think it's funny. Still got that same old attitude, ain't you? You got any money? Yeah, some. Why, you need some? Yeah. Bring me a fifth of Jack Daniels. They'll let you have that in here? If I could do what I wanted, I wouldn't be in here. Staying out at the place? Yes, sir, I thought I would. How's it look? Lonely. How long you going to be here? Uh, I don't know. Kind of depends. Well, you know where to find me. Jolie? Hello, HD. I didn't know you were here. I didn't know you were back. Just got in today. Gonna be staying? I don't know. That sounds like you. What are you looking for? A kind word. Well, I haven't had to nice talk anyone in a long time. I'll be seeing you? I live here. You having a party? [MUSIC - KEITH WHITLEY, "I'M OVER YOU"] Where there's a cloud don't mean there's rain. Tears in my eyes don't mean there's pain. Don't flatter yourself, I'm over you. Things aren't always what they seem. You can't believe everything you read on my face. I'm over you. You heard I'm drinking more than I... Why didn't you tell anybody you were coming? Oh, I didn't think about it. Oh, you never do think about it, you good for nothing. Look at you. You're too skinny. Get in here. Come on. I'll be right back. A Jack Daniel's for you, honey. HD, it's good to see you. Howdy. Make yourself at home, please? Let me fix you a drink. What are you drinking? I never touch the stuff. How come? Screws up your personality. Hm. Well, you been out to the rest home? Yeah. Yeah. I was out there this afternoon. Yeah. It's a nice place to retire with all those nice people taking care of you. Pathetic. The rooms are nice. Yeah, sure, if you don't mind the smell of piss. Will you get out here? Your old man put up a good fight on this, but you've got to face the cold hard facts sometime. Oh, hell, HD, I know you hate seeing him out there. None of us like it, but believe me, I think it's the best thing. I think it's best for all of us. And besides, he's got friends out there. You know Junior. Yeah, I've known Junior my whole life. Well, then, you know what I mean. He's great company for Jesse. Well, hell, yes. There's nothing I'd like better than talking to Junior all day. So, you hungry? I am. I've been running like an ape with his ass on fire all day. I saw Daddy today. How was he? He was up a tree. You know, there's a good deal of interest on that land your dad owns. Now I think you ought to talk to the real estate boys while you're still around here. What for? Well, it doesn't hurt to talk. No, it doesn't hurt to talk. Well, it ain't my land. HD, I know you're tired of hearing this, but Jesse's getting old. How was he today? I don't understand why he's there. You don't understand? No, I don't. Let me run this by you. Does he sound like the kind of a man that could take care of himself? I know he's getting old, I know he rambles and forgets. Is that any reason to put him in that God damn place? Now you're talking about selling his land like he was dead. He ain't dead. He's alive. Who the hell do you two think you are anyway? Well, I think that I'm his daughter, and I think that I've been the one here looking after him while you've been off playing cowboy somewhere. I knew you'd accuse me. I knew you would. I knew you'd accuse me. I ain't accusing nobody of nothing. I just want to know what the hell's going on. I'll tell you what the hell's going on. Cheryl has been through a lot with him. Now it's going to take some time, but you're going to get used to it. Trust me. For once in your life, just trust me. HD, I tried everything. I did. I hired a woman to go out there and cook and clean for him, you know, kind of watch after the place, but, no, he ran her off. And then I brought him here, and, God, you should have seen the two of them at the dinner table together. He did everything but sit in my food. And you know that I'm not one of Jesse's favorites. He forgets things, HD. He's not who he used to be. Is that right? Well, then, who is he? How long are you going to be around here anyway? A while. Long enough to mend. You're still riding bulls. Aren't you through with that? You know, it's a big mistake to stay at the fair too long. The smart ones quit. It's over when it's over. Don't leave. HD, please, just stay for supper. Did you even bother to go out and feed Jeeter? We looked everywhere for that dumb dog of yours. Yeah, well, he'd probably run off. Probably scared you were gonna put him in a God damn rest home. [PHONE RINGING] Jud, get the phone. Jud, when are you going to fix my bike? Shut up, Becky. Jud, now. Jud! Hello? HD: Jolie? I hope it ain't too late to be calling. Um, no, I got a teenage son. His friends don't ever seem to think it's too late. Girl, I've heard the opposite all day. JOLIE: What do you mean? It don't matter. It's just a lot of things have changed. That's right. They have. I was wondering if maybe we could have dinner? Hold on. I don't think so, HD. You know, it's really hard for me to get away at night. HD: Maybe lunch then? No, that's worse. Well, you tell me. You must have a few minutes to give an old friend. Look, you know, I'm trying to get everyone in bed right now. It's real hard. I'd just like to spend a little time with you, you know, talk about things. Would you guys knock it off, please? I'm trying to talk on the phone. Now. Shut up. HD, this is a really bad time for me. Hell, Jolie, I don't want to shove you or nothing. I mean, if it ain't... OK. Well, Becky, you know, my daughter, she's in this little dance class, and they're performing at the park on Saturday. And well, there's going to be a lot of people there, and I'll be there, and, well, I mean you could show up. It's 2 o'clock. A dance in the park? I gotta go. Bye. Welcome home, HD. RODEO ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER): Ladies and gentlemen, [INAUDIBLE]. HD just scored a second place. [APPLAUSE] RODEO ANNOUNCER (VOICEOVER): That was HD Dalton on Chisel. Remember this bull has never been ridden, ladies and gentlemen. The only one in the rodeo today that has ever been ridden. [CROWD GASPING] I really love that song, you know that? Reminds me of my fifth wife. Play, play, play. Well, what do you say there, Shotgun? Hey. You've been away for a while. Yeah, how long you been, HD? I don't know, a couple years. Couple of years? Shit, HD, I ain't seen you around here for at least five years. Five? Could be. I don't blame him. Not if I was at the bottom of the barrel playing a rodeo clown. Just helped a buddy out one night. Painted my face and crawled in the barrel. Just like his daddy. When you're needing help, Jesse won't let you down. You remember when you used to out them peanuts in your soda pop, HD? Last time I see this old cowboy ride was over in Weathering, I believe, and if I'm not incorrect, he drew down a third place. Is that right? It was a second. I knew that. I was just pulling your leg. Where's that old coot Jesse hiding out these days? He's out at Chillicothe. Good god almighty, HD. I didn't know that. How's he like it? He don't. That place will drive you nuts. I was out there for about six week, they had it down where they expected me to fart on schedule. They drive you crazy in that place. I ain't never been on a schedule my whole damn life. You don't mind if I take some dominoes? Take that box on that table. They're mine. Ain't that just like a rodeo bum, you never got a dime for nothing, do you? That why you went into that barrel? You licking up all the leftovers? Is that what you wanted? You son of a bitch. I'm gonna kick your ass for that. I don't know about that, Bubba. Better get in line. See you later, boys. Hey, Skeet, we gonna see you ride in Bullmania? HD: I don't know, maybe. Maybe knock your damn head off. Who's up? Who's up? Oh, Misty, did you get that poison ivy at yesterday's church picnic? Uh-huh. And the bad part is is that my boyfriend got it too and he wasn't even there. Hey, I saw you on TV. HD: You did? He watches everything. Worse than some kid. HD: Ain't nothing wrong with watching TV. There is when you're in the same room with it going day and night. He said that all people that are on TV are whores. That ain't very nice of him, is it? They can't here him. What'd you bring me? All right, Junior, time for a shampoo. No, I don't want to. He hates to get his hair washed, but it has to be done. I don't want to do it. Every week it's a fight. I'll be back. Oh. [INAUDIBLE], almost caught me. Will she remember? Of course, she'll remember. She'll be back. Lord, he hates to get his hair washed. They'll both be soaking wet by time she gets done. How is it? It tastes just like it used to. Hey, brought some dominoes. I figured we might have a little fun. Not in this nuthouse. Damn, I sure wish I could get out of this place. What's stopping you? You want to go, let's go. You really mean that? Sure, I mean it. Let's go. Right now? Right now. Junior, come on with us. My roommate's always leave me. I always stay. I'm ready. Let's get out of here before that old witch comes back. Don't forget to wash your hair. [MUSIC - PAUL OVERSTREET, "SEEING MY FATHER IN ME"] I'm seeing my father in me. Yes, it's how it's meant to be. And I find I'm more and more like him each day. I see them. They're headed for the farm. Right, I'm on my way. Clear. [MUSIC - PAUL OVERSTREET, "SEEING MY FATHER IN ME"] I notice I talk the way he talks. I'm starting to see my father in me. And I'm happy to see my father in me. [HONKING] Virgil. Hey. HD, how you doing? Man, I didn't know you was in the service. It's just something to do. You look about the same. Mean. What'd you do, arrest my dog? Just feeding him. Jeeter. Come here, boy. Come here. Yeah. Thanks, Virgil. No problem. I didn't come out here to bring our dog back. You didn't come out here to visit either, did you? VIRGIL: There's folks looking for you, Shotgun. Oh, hell. I knew it. There's a report out that your daddy was kidnapped. Kidnapped? Man, we just left. Yeah. Sometimes you ought to tell somebody, HD. What the hell for? It's up to him if he stays there. Cheryl, she's upset. Yeah, she probably is. This is my house, and I'm not leaving. It's all right with me, Mr. Dalton. I really don't know all that's going on. Just a family matter, Virge. I'd rather go after serial killers than getting in the middle of a family squabble. Ain't gonna be no squabble. I'll talk to Cheryl. I'm sure glad to hear you say that because here she comes. I hope it hurts. VIRGIL: Hold on, Cheryl. No, Virgil, you've done your job. It's a family matter from here on out. Just stay out. What do you think you're doing? You scared the hell out of me. Have you gone crazy or what? Of all the stupid things I have ever heard. I hope the rest home presses charges. I do. You outta be locked up. You ought to be in jail somewhere. Who the hell died and made you boss? I'm talking to, girl. Don't touch me. You shut up and listen. He don't belong in that place. It'll kill him. Well, who's going to take care of him? - Me. - You? Yeah, me. You can't take care of yourself. What are you going to do, sell that precious pickup truck of yours? Yeah, you'll take care of him. You'll take care of him until you tramp off to some damn rodeo, and then it's my problem. Don't you worry about it. I'll take care of him. You're both crazy, you know that? You're gonna start fighting like cats and dogs the minute you start reliving the past. Come on, Daddy. He ain't going nowhere. Stay right there. [HONKING] Add one more to the picnic. Is everything OK? No, everything's not OK. They're both crazy. Dad, are you going back to Chillicothe? Oh, no, HD here is going to play nursemaid. Are they going to sleep here together? I don't know, Clint, but you can bet one thing, when the trouble starts, I'm going to be the one that hears about it. I don't know what's going on here, but if you want my opinion... Well, thank you. Thank you very much for your attention, gentlemen. You want me, you know where to find me. It's like talking to two uncaged badgers. Cheryl! Damn it. If it's not one thing, it's another. I guess they handled that situation pretty well. Shotgun? Huh? I ain't seen you sack like that since our senior year. HD, welcome home. Thanks, Virgil. VIRGIL: Mr. Dalton. See you, Virgil. Well, that's the end of that. That wasn't too bad. [LAUGHING] Haven't you shaved yet? No, sir, I was waiting till you was done it here. I always shave first. First thing every morning. I'd rather be caught out without my pants than to start the day without shaving. Uh-huh. What the hell's that? What this? A throwaway razor. You use those little old cheap throwaway razors? Yes, sir. There ought to be a law against them. HD: Uh-huh. I heard they weren't any good anyway. HD: They're all right. They don't cost much. You just use them a few times and throw them away. Sounds like progress to me. Of course, there never was anything better than a straight edge razor. Uh-huh. When did you start shaving that way? What way? Well, crossways like you was doing there. I always stick to a smooth up and down stroke. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, when did you start that? I don't... ow. What'd you do, cut yourself? No, that's why I'm bleeding. Well, now you don't need to get smart alecky. I didn't teach you to shave that way. It's those damn little old things there. They'll do it every time. What the hell we talking about? Shaving, I thought. Why don't you go feed Jeeter? I've already fed Jeeter. Ow. God. That razor about chewed you up, didn't it? Yes, sir. What you getting all duded up about? I'm going into town. Well, you don't need to get all gussied up to go into town. Well, that's right. I'm going to see a little girl dance in the park. Well, hell, if you don't want to tell me, just say so. Daddy, you want to ride to town with me? Nope. You're sure? Yep. You're welcome to come along. Go on. I'll be all right. Be good to have a little peace and quiet. You sure? Yep. Be back in a couple hours. Don't hurry. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Toot, toot, Tootsie, goodbye. Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry. The choo choo train that takes me away from you. No words can tell how sad it makes me. Kiss me, Tootsie, and then do it over again. Watch for the mail, I'll never fail. If you don't get a letter, then you'll know I'm in jail. Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry. Which ones yours? The prettiest. No, she's the tallest one in the center. (SINGING) Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry. The choo choo train that takes me away from you. No words can tell how sad it makes me. Kiss me, Tootsie, and then do it over again. Watch for the mail, I'll never fail. If you don't get a letter, then you'll know I'm in jail. Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry. Toot, toot, Tootsie, goodbye. That's Becky's last number, unless you want to stay for the rest of them? Uh-uhn. Mom? Oh, sweetie, you were fabulous. So good. Perfect. HD, this is Becky. Becky, this is HD. He came by here today to see you dance. Hi, Becky. I loved you. Thanks. HD, this is my son Jud. Jud. Jud, you and Becky got a ride with the Johnsons. I'm going to visit with HD and pick up some groceries. If that's OK with you? Uh-huh. You watch Becky for me? Great. I won't be long. (MOCKING) I won't be long. Excuse me. I told you I didn't want you using this shit. Great looking kids. Yeah, thanks. Jud gets a little sullen sometimes. I guess it's hard living with two females. Yeah. I guess he misses his dad. Sorry to hear about Ed's accident. It must have been horrible. Yeah, it was horrible. I don't really want to talk about it. Why don't you tell me what's going on with you. Seems like old times. You, me, and a pickup. That was a different time, and I was a different person. Feels the same to me. Damn toy food. Kids love them. You stick them in the microwave for about four minutes, and, boom, you got a meal. Ought to be a law against it. Can't cook it yourself, you shouldn't eat it. Well, it looks like you're a real gourmet. Damn straight. I'm an expert. They had hamburgers all over the country. Trick is, baste them in beer, smother them in garlic, just a touch if chili sauce. Jolie, you ever think about getting old? Give me a break. What did you think I'd looked like after 14 years? I'm not talking about you. I mean, just plain getting old. I got two kids. I don't have time to think about that. There ought to be a law against it. Against what? There ought to be a damn special police force that when you get too old, they just come and arrest you, and throw your ass in one of them old age homes. At least then when you got stuck there you know what your crime was. Got a lot on your mind, don't you, HD? Yeah. Jolie, do you think that maybe we could have a real date? I mean, like for dinner or some... Oh, god, I sound like a sappy teenager. Sorry I said anything. Forget the whole thing. Didn't mean it. You're still something else. You make me laugh. I'll go out on a real date for dinner or something. Go on. Go on. He called me. Said he hadn't eaten all day, and there was nothing in the house. And you were gone. I told you I'd be back in a couple hours. Been longer than that. I stopped off to get some things. Well, I was starved. Well, we've got plenty now. I wasn't gone that long. Well, it was long enough for him to get hungry. Cheryl. I'll handle it. It ain't your problem anymore. Oh, it's not? Well, tell me, what do I do when he calls me and he needs clean clothes or something to eat, or maybe he's confused, he needs to know what day it is? Then I'll be here. No, you won't. You'll be here until you can rodeo again, and then you're going to be gone. I know, HD. You're selfish. You think you're too good to work like everybody else. You don't care what happens here. If I didn't care, I wouldn't have broke him out. Broke him out? God, listen to you. You sound like you've just pulled off some great romantic escapade. We'll Well, grow up. What the hell's the matter with you, Sis? I'm mad. God. It's one thing for you to kind of just slouch through life. It's your life. Fine. But what you have done here is so typically irresponsible, and I know who's going to have to pick up your mess when you're gone. As usual, it's going to be me. Cheryl, I promise you, I'm going to see this one through. How? Are you going to take him with you? You know, you either got to get a day job or you have to go back to rodeoing, and either way, he is a problem. I don't know. I'll work it out. Just don't give up on him. He never quit on us. HD, he cannot take care of himself. He needs a babysitter. He ain't an old pair of boots going to Goodwill. He's a hero. He's my hero. You don't put away your heroes. Oh, really? Well, tell me what do you do with them when they are old and sick and tired and worn out and unable to function anymore? You honor them, Cheryl. You honor them. They ain't plastic. You don't throw them away. You ever think about getting old? Of course, I do. You want to be in that rest home, Cheryl? Is that what you want? It could happen to you. You want your kids to put you in a damn home some day? [BARKING] [COUGHING] Dad? Dad? Jesus. Oh, god. Come on, Jeeter, get out here. Dad, what you trying to do, burn down the house? Hey, Daddy, you left bacon grease on the fire. The house is full of smoke. God damn. You could have burned the house down. You should have been up. Probably would have noticed if you'd been up. I put it out. That's good thinking. Dad, you could have set the house on fire. But I didn't, and that's what counts. I just about got this little old puddle jumper started. Plugs was bad in it. I'm gonna open up the windows, clear out the smoke. Good thinking. HD? What happened? Left the skillet in the fire. Shit, I've done that before. That ain't nothing. That old man's gonna kill us both. Oh, god. Wow. How'd you get that? You wear that all the time? What do you want? I want to ride bulls, like, like you do. Oh, yeah. I don't think your mama's going to be too excited about you riding bulls. That's why I came out to see you. I thought if I could get you to help me, it might, you know, smooth things out with her. Yeah, well, it just might. Look, we're going to have a little understanding first. I don't want to never hear you talking back to your momma. Me? Whoa. Whoa. I never want to hear you talking vulgar. I don't. Give me that dip. What? In your back pocket, son, hand it over. I don't won't you using this sh... stuff neither. You can learn a bunch on this thing. All right, cover this sucker with a carpet so it's more like a bull's hide. It's loose like a bull's hide plus it'll give you something to dig your spurs into, hang on with. You got grommets there, there, there, and there. Attach this one with a rope to that post there. One to that one there. One... [CAR APPROACHING] What the hell? What happened? You dad had a little accident with the tractor. Accident? Oh, it wasn't really an accident. You OK, Daddy? How you doing there? Fine. Need some help with this thing? Yeah. You're Jolie's boy, aren't you? Yep/ Did HD learn on this? Yes, sir. Him and his buddies, they'd put one of these things together every weekend. They'd ride it till they wore it out or somebody got an arm broke. What happened, Virgil? He said he was going to mow the ditch over at Mrs. Miller's house. He and a woman in a Ford station wagon, they hit the bridge about the same time. He veered off and hit the bridge railing. Just about scared her to death. - Didn't hurt her? - No. No. He didn't even touch the car. I don't think it hurt the tractor either. It's up Mustang Gas. Hand me that pipe there. Here you go. Do you know what they do with this? No. What in the hell is that in your ear? I'll be damned. Well, they take this pipe and they make a place for your knee on each side of this barrel. That way you ride a little better. [INAUDIBLE] quite so round. Thanks, Virgil. I really appreciate this. Any time, Shotgun. Get that rope there and tie on that post right there. Man, this ain't gonna be easy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] JOLIE: I sure had a good time tonight. I'm glad we did this. HD: Me too. So, um, how's Jud doing on the rig? Good, he's learning the same way I did. Good. I had some big dreams in them days. You sure did. Tell me this, all those years on the road, think it was worth it? I don't know. If you're talking about all the crap I've taken, lousy food, and the busted bones, the mornings I woke up with no idea where I was, or who I was, no, nothing was worth that. Then why'd you keep doing it? Because when I'm on that bull and everything's going right, right then it's the best. You know what I'm saying? Not really. OK, like, race car drivers and pilots, people like that are running machines that are built to be controlled, but the bull's uncontrolled. He don't want me on his back. He wants me on the ground where he can dance on me. He's wild and free, just a part of nature. And sometimes, when the chute opens, and they turn us loose, just sometimes, something magic happens, and I'm a part of that animal. For 8 seconds, I get to be wild and free and uncontrolled. And when I make that right, and then I hit the ground and raise my hands, everybody yells, it is worth it. It sure is pretty. Yeah, it sure is. Remember? Yes. Yes, I remember. What's wrong? You broke my heart when you left. Took a long time trying to get over you, HD. Then I met someone else. Thank god for Ed. Forgot about you. I never forgot about you. Oh, that's hard to prove by me. What, did you think I was just here frozen in time waiting for you to come back? You think the world just stops because you're not around? You can't leave me and then walk back into town and just pick up where you left off. There's been a lot of living going on. While you've been out chasing your dreams, I've been stuck here standing still, and it hasn't all been fun, and it's been lonely. I needed you, and you left. All you ever needed were your damned rodeos, and now you think you can just waltz right back into my life, and take me for some dancing and a little dinner and to the grocery store, then bring me out under the stars. I mean, is that what you think you can... Well, you're probably right, but you're the only one that could. You bastard. Jolie. I missed you. I missed you bad. You think your dad's been watching? Yeah, you can bet on it. Good night, Mr. Dalton. Goodnight, Jolie. [LAUGHING] There he was, the biggest, meanest looking bull I've ever seen in my life. Looked like a nightmare from hell. He had me trapped. There wasn't nothing I could do but face him, so I stood my ground. I knew there was only one way to stop him, but I didn't have time. Because there was 2,000 pounds of hide and horns running at me. You know what I did, son? I dove into that ground like a rock, and I reached up and I grabbed a handful of testicles. You know what testicles are, son? Balls. Balls. Stopped that bastard right in his tracks. The moral to mt story is, son, when you've got them by the balls, you can stop them on a dime. You're a lot of help. Come on, Jud, we've got some work to do. [PHONE RINGING] Got any more stories? Yeah, I got another one, but I don't want him to hear it though. I'll get down her with you. Hello? Jolie. Hm? Yeah, sure, right away. Yeah, right now. OK. Jolie? Jolie? Jolie? What happened? I thought you was hurt. Come on in. You want some coffee? Uh-uhn. What's going on? What's going on? Sit down. That's why I asked you to come here this morning, because I thought maybe you could tell me what's going on. I don't understand. You don't understand? That's the problem. You don't understand. Let me help you. Now I'm going to put this on your terms. The way I figure it, I've already struck out twice, so I was wondering if last night was strike three. Last night was wonderful. It was wonderful? How wonderful was it, HD? Was it wonderful enough to keep you here? You know, I was touched when you told me that you felt bad about Ed's accident, and then I remembered that I never even heard from you. You didn't call me. You didn't write me a letter. You didn't even ask any of my friends how I was doing. I guess you were just at one of your rodeos down in Arkansas or Texas. Jolie, what are you talking about? All you cowboys, you're all alike. You just shuffle in and you grin and you never grow up. You're all hat and you're no cattle. I'm hurting, HD. I just want to know if it's going to stop. What are we doing? What are we doing? Just tell me what we're doing. You know me, Jolly. I never did know what to say to a woman till after midnight. Oh, god. I didn't mean that. I really didn't mean that. Please, don't cry. Don't feel bad. Please? Why, HD? Because it's too real for you? I am real, and I come with baggage. I've got two kids, and I'm looking for more than just a good time on a Saturday night. Me too. Oh, really? I never knew till right now. What? I love you. I'm in love with you, and I ain't leaving. I ain't going nowhere. I love you. Thank you. Oh, I love you. You going to be all right? Yep. You sure you ain't going to get hungry on me and be starving before I get back? No. Good enough. I'm going to Cheryl's. Well, be sure and give my best to your brother-in-law Clint. How do you want our steak, Teresa? Medium is great. Thanks. Rex? Rare, please. HD? As long as it ain't breathing. OK. HD, that's rare. [BUG ZAPPER] Whoa. How do you like my bug light? Bugs fly into that and fry like burgers. I hate the think. I wish you'd turn it off. Well, Cheryl, that's what's keeping the bugs out of the meat, OK? HD, we heard about Daddy's accident. Is he all right? Oh, yeah, it's nothing. He just got a bloody nose. He wanted to ignore, so that's what I did. Something awful is going to happen to him. OK, OK, hold it down a minute. Let's take a walk, OK? Rex? Yo. Come and mind the barbecue? Absolutely. Let's go around the house. HD, this is the right thing to do. I haven't wanted to tell you this, but it's costing us a fortune to keep him at the rest home, and Medicare is not paying a dime. Yeah, you got nothing to worry about, because he ain't going to be there. Listen to me, I would do anything for Jesse, but the way the government's got everything all screwed up, it's just plain silly for his land to sit there while it could be working for him. It's just not good business. What the hell's he talking about? I'll tell you what we're talking about. I don't know if Daddy's told you. He probably doesn't even remember it, but he signed his power of attorney over to me. Now, I don't want to do it this way, HD, but I will if I have to. I want you to work with us on this, but Daddy should be in that home. Yeah. Oh, I understand. You don't want to sell him out, but you just might have to. She don't know. She don't care. Nobody knows. Nobody cares. Need any help? I can make it by myself. When did that happen? What difference does it make? None, I guess. You get hurt, you get up. You go on, that's rodeo. Least you could've told me. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but I'd be hurting just the same. Sometimes it helps to share your pain, son. HD: It's my pain. I;m the one that's got to live with it. That's just like you. You're just going to do what you want to do. What are you yelling at? Well, you're not going to tell anybody anything. You're not going to listen to anybody. Listen? That's all I ever did with you is listen. Listen to me? Hell, yes, listen. You told me everything. You told me what schools I should go to. You told me what sports I should play. You even god damn told me when to ride. You had the answer to everything. I thought that's what a father was supposed to do, help his kids with their decisions. Yeah, they was your decisions, not mine. Never once did you ask me what I wanted to do. We talked all the time. No, we didn't. You talked, I listened. That's all I ever did was listen. I didn't know you felt that way. You never asked. I thought I understood what you wanted. I didn't know it was to get rid of me. Wait, get rid... I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be with you. I did the best I could for you kids. But going down the road wasn't any place for a family man, so I stayed home. I left, you stayed. I did it. You didn't even try. You put that goddamn guilt trip on me because I did what you was never able to do. It was your mom, son. The truth is with her, I didn't want to leave. And then we lost her, and then you left. I'm here now. I'm still hurting, son. You just got to figure out some way to get along. I just don't know what to say anymore. You could say you're going to make me the best damn hamburger I've ever had without burning down the damn house. Yeah, I'll put just a little touch of chili sauce on it. Basted in beer, smothered the garlic. What are you doing here? Thinking. I was looking for you. Saw your pick up. Something wrong? Well, I haven't heard from you, and, well, the other day, you said... And then I didn't see you, and I didn't... You didn't call and... Jolie, come here. HD, you scared the shit out of me. I thought you changed your mind. Not about us, never. Come on. It's just about money. I've got to get my hands on a lot of money to fight my sister, and the only way I know how to do that is to ride that damn bulls. You're already broken up. It's too dangerous. You can't go back to that. Jolie, it's the only thing I know how to do. It's the only thing I can do. What's the matter, son? Uh, Everything's just crowding in on me, pushing me for answers. All the answers involve money. They usually do. I think I'm going to go after that big money at Bullmania. I know that all sounds sweet, but are you sure you're up to it? No, sir. I'm going to need some help. All right, son, let's rise and shine. [INAUDIBLE] 10 miles from here in a long trot. Come on, let's go. That's good. Now put them all back where they came from. Son, roping in like dancing. Once you get out time, you probably won't catch it. Step back there just a little. That's enough. Now you watch where my hand is when I deliver that rope. How about getting old dad one of them beers? Yes, sir. What the hell happened to you? Just trying to get my head right. Let's go. You're finally getting with the program, huh? Yeah, that looks better. You boys look so pretty, that I'm gonna buy you some breakfast. Go back for some more. Mr. Dalton, think I'll get you for cruel and unusual punishment. Yeah. Looks like he's in the Army. Going to war. What's that got to do with bull riding? It's just a small part of the big picture, Virgil. Mr. Dalton, you would've made a hell of a football coach. You been running all these years? A little bit. Oh, man, more than a little bit. Stay with him, son. You got one more to go before you get to ride for the money. Stay with it. [INAUDIBLE], boy. Rodeo is getting your head right. He could be crippled for life on that bull. That's right. But now his mind's crippled. If he doesn't get his head right, it's not going to matter about his back. Yeah, well, it matters to me. When's he gonna come down? Tonight. He's got to ride three bulls and score real big to get that bonus bull, and that barn is his third bull. Third bull. Bullshit. You're all crazy. She talks kind of dirty, don't she, son? Sure does. Won't be able to do much today. Why not? Well, if it keeps on raining, it'll be all wet and muddy. They don't cancel rodeos for wet and muddy, son. Especially when there's $100,000 involved. If you're going to be a rodeo hand, you better keep using that thing. That's better. Got a little off balance didn't you, son? Dad. Jud, get the truck. But I don't drive. You're gonna drive tonight. Get the damn truck. Get it started now. Now. Dad? Come on, Daddy. Come on. Shotgun. Hey, Virge, thanks for coming. Boy, he took a hell of a whack. They gave him some stitches. Running tests on him right now. Come on, let's take a walk. OK. I want you to listen to me. I'm your friend. Yeah? But I got my job to do. I got a call from Cheryl. In the morning, she's going to get a court order, a restraining order that protects your daddy from you. What? What, what are you talking about? It means you can't go near your father. What is this bullshit? Look, I told you something bad was going to happen, but, no, you wouldn't listen to me. It was an accident. I know it was an accident, HD. An accident that wouldn't have happened if you'd left him alone where he belonged. Yeah, where he could rot away and die from neglect. That would be fine. Well, it ain't gonna happen, Cheryl. It ain't. Look, HD, if you want to kill yourself, that's fine. You just go right ahead, but you are not taking my father with you. Hey, glad you're back, HD. Hey, good to see you, HD. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Welcome to Lazy E [INAUDIBLE] Bullmania, where today we're going to see the greatest bucking bulls in all of professional rodeo, and they're going to be pitted against the top bull riders in the world. Speaking of bucking bulls, that includes the greatest one in the world today, the mighty Thunderbolt. The $100,000 bull. That's the amount of money that somebody can win in the bonus round [INAUDIBLE] and no man has ever been to four seconds on his back. So you see, friends, this is not a five and dimer deal. No, sir. This is a blue plate special. You're going to see the best of the best. RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, look at this one. Get back. Which way is he going to go? [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: That's a good solid score. Here's David Burton next going on one called Big Ben. [INAUDIBLE] Everything's set to go here. [INAUDIBLE] no score. Richard Rule is the cowboy, New Deal is the bull under him. He's a big, bad, son-of-a-gun, [INAUDIBLE].. Richard is there and he's going to be. [INAUDIBLE] outside foot. Stay there, stay up on the rope. He's out of his [INAUDIBLE] and down he goes. David Burton is next to go on one called Black Bart, and here's about 1,800 pounds of fury. [INAUDIBLE] Come on. He's making a great ride. [INAUDIBLE] Come on, Dave, you can do it. Stay there. Look at the strength and the power of the bull can throw a man. We hope it's not a bad injury, but medics are here to take care of him. Come on, David, be all right. How about a great big old-fashioned home town welcome for a home grown cowboy who's been away for awhile? Next to go is HD Dalton on House Wrecker. Be the first ride for what he hopes will lead to the bonus round. [INAUDIBLE] tear him apart [INAUDIBLE].. He's ready. Ride this son-of-a-gun, HD. Let's go. [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: Oh, what a great ride. HD scores an 83 on that ride. Welcome home, HD. That's the way to go. HD has just completed the first step of the comeback with that great ride, but, oh, golly, he's up against people like world champions Tough Hedeman and Jim Sharp. There's still a long, long way to go. [INAUDIBLE] relying on balance. Look at this one. Lifting through the power of this man. [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE]. Score one for the bull. The bull is looking for someone to play with. Look out, Patch, [INAUDIBLE]. How about that? Here's HD up on his second ride, [INAUDIBLE].. He didn't score too well on that ride, just 76, but that still puts him in second place just behind the leader Jim Sharp. [INAUDIBLE] [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: A great score, an 81. HD Dalton, currently in second place, is next to go. He needs a high scored ride on Best Western if he's going to move into that number one spot. [INAUDIBLE] Come on, HD, let's go for it. Let's go. Drop shoulder and look at that great recovery. [INAUDIBLE] [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: Sensational. He's done it with a score of 90. He is hurt. That leg just buckled under him and this man is hurt. As our rodeo clown escort this man out of arena and this man is hurt. We're waiting to hear if HD's injury is gonna keep him from trying to ride son-of-a-gun called Thunderbolt. If yes, it means $100,000 to him. Let's hope that HD will be able to make this ride. [INAUDIBLE], hurts like hell. Well, what you going to do? He's gonna ride that damn bull. That's what he's going to do. He hurt his leg. I think it's broke. Those people out there didn't spend their money to watch you walk. They come here to watch you ride that bull, and that's what you're going to do. Jud, get in that satchel and give me a bandage and some tape out of it, please. Now, you're going to ride this bull and I'm gonna tell you why. You're riding this bull because you're ready to ride. You're going to make magic tonight. It's going to be you and that bull for eight seconds. Nothing else in the whole world matters. All right. Thanks, Virgil. Good luck, HD. [INAUDIBLE]. You remember me too, don't you? I remember you. RODEO ANNOUNCER: HD's at the shoot, folks. He's going to ride, banged up leg and all. No way this cowboy's gonna pass up his chance at $100,000. And all he's got to do to get it is stay on the back of a bull that's never been ridden. There they are right there. Virgil, how could you have let him come out here? Nobody let me do anything, and I hope you didn't come down here and try and stop me. And I'll tell you something else, little girl. If you punch me, I'll turn you over my knee and spank your bottom. Virgil, what are you going to do about this? I'm gonna wish him luck. Tell HD to kick ass. Get out of the way. Jesse, we still have power of attorney. Not now, you don't. Come on, HD, stick to him. Let's go, boys. Let's go. [HORN] RODEO ANNOUNCER: He's done it. He's done it. My god, he's done it. HD Dalton has ridden that $100,000 bull. HD has done it. Thunderbolt has been ridden. He's won. He's won. HD has won. He's won. HD has won. Thunderbolt has been conquered. (CHANTING) HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! HD! [MUSIC PLAYING]
