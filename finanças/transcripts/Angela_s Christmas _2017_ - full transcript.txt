Hup! Yah. Angela, you're late! Pat, why isn't Aggie wearing her jumper? I couldn't get it on her, Mammy, and Angela's late again. That child will have me above in St. Jeremiah's asylum. Mammy says you'll have her in the asylum - if you don't get down this minute. - Pat! Angela! Uh! Ooh! Oof! - Angela! - Coming. How have you grown out of this already? You'll catch your death. She can have mine. Thank you, Angela. Late again, I see. Yes. Hello, Mrs. Blake. - Pat, give your jacket to Angela. - What? My jacket to Angela? - Get your own jacket. - No more messing about. - Here. - Tom, you give yours to Pat. You look like a clown, all big and bulky like-- - I'm grand. - I won't see you catching your death. I don't want to wear my ma's coat to Mass. Then take my scarf. Right, come on. It'll be Christmas Day before we get there. You're going in. - Maggot. - You're a maggot. Agh! Hey, hey, hey. - I'm telling Mam. - You're not. She'll send you to bed without even a cup of tea. Shut up. She won't. When you take a coin from her purse, you're punished. Imagine what she would do for pushing me under a horse. - Hurry up, the pair of you. - Pat pushed me. I didn't. It is a time for reflection and a time to help those less fortunate and to forgive foes and those who've sinned against us. - Telltale. - Stop it. - Telltale. - Stop it. ...to celebrate in one another's love. Jesus entering Jerusalem, coming into the temple, they too were late, and they were separate living out... Aye...? Sorry. Can you please just stop fighting for one minute? As it is written in Luke," "'For unto you was born this day in the city of David a Savior which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger.' He'll catch his death. - Angela, shush. - The baby's cold. Angela, shh! Amen. Amen. Amen. Happy Christmas to ya! Mama. - Mammy, can I go back and light a candle? - No, Angela, we need to get home. Please, Mam, just one for the baby Jesus. - Please? - Mama, Mama. - Mama, Mama. - Stop it, Aggie. Go on, so. But run straight home as soon as you're done. I will. - Jesus Christ... - ...Jesus Christ and our Lord... - ...temptation... - ...Jesus... Glory to the Father... What's that? Ah-choo! Ah... ah-choo! Eh...? Bless you. Thank you. God bless us, save us! Hello. Would no one put a blanket over your little body? I bet you would never complain 'cause you wouldn't want to make your mammy the slightest bit unhappy. What? Oh! Oh, the thief. The thief...! - ...said thank you to me. - I think He said thank you to me first. There's no way... But if you remember rightly... Are you all right in there? We'll get you home, get you all warm and snuggly and wrap you up like a little holy sausage. Mm-hmm. Oh, it's not far. Just a few streets down that way. Father, how are you? There's been a miracle. What? What miracle? Look at all those lovely sweets. If you're good, Mam might give us a penny and we can spend it on whatever we want. Bull's-eyes, pear drops, humbugs, whatever you want. What's that? Oh, no, we can't go in, Baby Jesus. Mam said we had to go straight home, no question. Well, since it's your birthday, we'll go in for one minute. Oh, it's free to look. You can look at them all day if you like. Would you look at them all there? Excuse me. My favorites are the apple drops. Excuse me. Shop's closed. I-I didn't-- Hey, what have you got there? - Is it a dolly from Santy? - No, 'tis too early for Santy. - Did you steal it from Santy? - Er-- - Oof! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh, shh. Easy, easy, easy. Uh...? What's that? Uh... Is it... Is it a Christmas shillin'? Thanks. Huh. Oh, Baby Jesus, they don't understand. I'm not stealing you. I just want to get you warm. One night, just one night in my room, then I'll bring you back. It's just silly shadows. It's just silly shadows. I'm not at all frightened, so you shouldn't be either. Penny for the pauper. There you go. Even I can see that you have a good heart, me darlin'. Merry Christmas. And a merry Christmas to you. I don't want anyone gawking at us. Let's go round the back. Will you help me, Baby Jesus? Okay, so... one, two, three... hup! No, no, no, Baby Jesus. One, two, three. Hup! Come on now, Baby Jesus. No more messin'. Try really hard this time. One, two, three. Hup! You did it, Baby Jesus. Good man, yourself. Oh, no. Oh, no, Baby Jesus. What are you doing in Mrs. Blake's yard? There's no excuse for the way you're behaving, flying round like an angel. I've a good mind to leave you there. All right, all right. I'll come and get you. Don't make a sound. Oh, no, you poor thing. And me giving out to you and everything. And you're smiling at me even though I hurt you. Come here to me. Huh? That's the baby Jesus from the church. He's supposed to be sleeping in his crib and you have him here in the freezing cold? I'm warming him up. His mammy will be roaring and bawling when she sees him gone. Right, fire. This is where myself and Aggie sleep. Now you must be careful 'cause she ripped the head off my doll. But don't worry, I'll mind you. Angela's upstairs with the baby Jesus. Is she now? Isn't that great? His mammy will be roaring and bawlin'. And I suppose all the angels and saints are coming over for dinner too. Pat. Shh, shh, shh. I'm telling the truth! - See? I wasn't telling stories. - Mother of God. Is that the baby Jesus from St. Joseph's? I-- I just wanted to warm him. Oh, Jesus. We can sneak him into the milk mart. They'll find him in the morning. - He'll freeze! - You can't just steal the baby Jesus. His mammy will be sick with worry. - I'm keeping him warm. - He has to go back to his mam! - Stop. He's staying. - She's gonna be sick! - He can't just stay here, Angela. - He has to go back! Enough! Enough, all of you. Pat, put the kettle on. - What about the--? - Put the kettle on. Please, Mammy, please? I'll warm him and I'll tell his mother we have him safe in the bed. You've all had your say. one about the night you were born. - I was born on New Year. - Stroke of midnight. Head in the old year, feet in the new. We were gonna write to the Pope to ask what year you were born in. We can't be listening to stories with the baby Jesus on the table. The night you were born, it was bitterly cold. So cold that the midwife kept her coat on. Happy New Year. Why was your heart breaking, Mam? Your father. Go in and meet your sister, boys. Hi, babba. In you go, Pat. Your father wasn't proud of his actions that night, but when he heard how you boys minded your mother, when he saw his baby daughter for the first time, he was the proudest man in Limerick. I miss Dadda. I know you do, Pat. We all do. He needs to go home. - Angela? - I just need to do one thing. What is she doing, Mam? - Come on! - Huh? Angela, wait. - Will you come on? - Boys, coats. Come on. You'll have me above in St. Jeremiah's with your messin'. What if we're caught, Angela? We'll be fine, Pat. Come on. And then, He let out a sneeze. A sneeze so small and heavenly, only an angel could have made it. A sneezy miracle! And then, then-- Didn't the Baby Jesus Himself only go and thank the both of us? Amazing! Quick. Come on. Oh, you've broken it. Sorry. - Sorry, Father. - Guard, we have the thief. But, but... No, no, no, no. She was only warming the baby Jesus. You won't put my sister in jail. You won't. He was cold in the crib, so I took him home to warm him up. Well, then. It looks like we've no choice but to lock you up for the taking of... "one baby Jesus." And on his birthday, of all things. I fail to see how this is a laughing matter. You're right, Father. There is nothing funny about taking a child, any child-- away from his family on Christmas Eve. Wait. You'll need this... or you'll catch your death. Thank you. Goodbye. - Good boy, Pat. - Thanks, Pat. - Yeah, well done, Pat. - Thanks. Oh, dear Lord. Ah...! Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! It's a miracle. A Christmas miracle! It's a miracle. - Happy Christmas. - And a merry Christmas to you. - Angela? - Coming.
