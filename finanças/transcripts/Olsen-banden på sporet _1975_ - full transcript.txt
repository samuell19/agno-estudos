And they lived ever after Breakfast is here. Good morning. - Can l borrow a little cash? - l don't have any. - You'll have to talk to Egon. - You know how Egon is. Good morning. There isn't any cheese. You got Danish milk, Danish eggs, Danish butter. You got rolls and pastry, that still is warm. What else do you want? - We always get cheese. - Nonsense. - Maybe we'll get some rain today. - lt only rains 15 hours a year. - So no chance. - Where's your mother? She wants to move to a house where there are no white mice. They vanished when she got a Bloody Mary. Watch out for the vase ... oops. Good morning ... Sorry. We'll need some more ice, extra glasses, and more vodka. Look, Egon has got two heads. How can you stand it in this heat? - Stop it. - Fine. But at least take the one hat off. - l need some dough. - Again? - Things aren't free, you know. - What now? It's some girls you're showing off to. lt's no fun being a broke millionaire. They're my millions, too. - And mine. - You're such a cheap-ass, Egon. Stop that drunken babbling. What would you do without me? - I would travel home. - Nonsense. I would travel home. And go to work. Every morning. In the rain. That's stupid. We should invest the money. - Nonsense. - Right. Just tell him off, Keld. We should invest the money instead of keeping it in a suitcase. - Bloody good, Benny. - Then we could get some cash. You're all crazy. - You should have talked to that firm. - We'll stay out of their schemes. They are going broke. They'll do anything to get money. They just want to rob us. But the money stays with me, always! - When two heads, you must have 2 cheap-asses. - Shut up. I have made you millionaires. We have a villa, a beautiful view, a pool, three TV's, and no tax. - Can't you see that we're happy? - Sure ... And we can go on like this till the day we die. Zürich, this is Copenhagen. l'm in Spain. l'll fix it. I know how I'll do it. I'll strike during their siesta. Stop! Don't touch it! Hi, you two. Do you want a drink? You can't do that. Stop the thief! Benny. Keld. Yvonne. - Jeez, Egon. Have you drowned? - Get me a ladder. Keld and Benny, hurry up. Egon is dead. - Did he get all the money? - Was it him? That bastard. - What are we going to do? - l have a plan. He'll put the money in their safe. lt's a Franz Jäger safe. Let's go. l'll take care of it. You'll be on the look-out. What the hell? The police. Let's get out of here. THE OLSEN GANG ON THE TRACK 'Albertslund station.' - Finally! - Have you been released already? - They let me out on good behavior. - You're a real brown-noser, then. - Where are they? - Out. They don't want to see you. - Why? - Mom's freaked out. - She's out of her mind, wants my hair cut too. - Where are Keld and Benny? They're at work. At least, that's what they call it. There you have it. Canned laughter. They use it on TV all the time. The invention of the century. Every home should have one. lt's a must when you feel blue. When your in-laws drop by or when you have a hang-over, - - just push the button and laugh your head off. Pretty good, eh? You get three cans for just 10 crowns. l'll be taking a short break. Will be back in five minutes. You scared the shit out of me. Did they let you out already, Egon? - I got out 2 months early on good behavior. - A regular brown-noser, eh? - You're a real businessman. - lt's a living. Showbiz has its ups and downs. And how are you? I suppose you have a plan. - Why, of course. - All timed and checked. - Of course. - And there's no time to waste. You never change. I wonder about your intelligence sometimes. How dare you? You make a fool of yourself with those stupid cans. - Who do you think you are? - Relax. Don't get me wrong. - I've got a plan. No time to waste. - You can count on me. - But Keld is out. - Where is he? - He's in number 8. - Number 8? He's in showbiz, too. DlSABLED - Good God. Let's go to Keld's place. - That might not be a good idea. - What's the problem? - Yvonne wants the money back. And she's gone to the police. - The police? - Yes, have you heard something as moronic before? - 90 million? - l believe so, yes. We had 100 million when we left, but then we've spent some. - But l've told you all that the 17 times before. - Yes, 117 times. No, 17. Our money was sincerely stolen from us in Spain. And if the police can't help us, we'll have to go to the press. We're working on it. We contacted the Spanish embassy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, - - lnterpol, FBl, ClA, and we put an ad in the police paper. When will you have some money for me, then? - We don't have much time. - We can't work miracles. l have been very patient with you. But l'll need money by Wednesday. Maybe you can't get all 90 million, but you could give me an advance. Let's say ... three million. You're completely out of your mind! Holm! Take this. This is your first solo assignment. And you make sure that I'll never see that crazy woman again. No, forget it, Egon. We're totally legit now. We'll take the whole thing to court. No more schemes. - Let's offer the man a drink. - They've let you out early. - On good behavior. - So you're a brown-noser, eh? - l want to talk to Yvonne. - She's here. And she's mad. - I dare not go up there, then. - What are you afraid of? She doesn't bite, does she? We have had to put up with a lot from you, Egon. And it has brought us nothing but misfortune and human tragedy. - Didn't you become millionaires? - Sure, we did. But it resulted in exile, indigestion, and intemperance. - l'm not trying to excuse myself. - But all that wasn't my fault. No, it wasn't, Egon. But we're not millionaires now. - And who is to blame for that? - The money was stolen from us. - We have turned it over to the police. - Foolishness. You may call it foolishness, but 90 million is serious business for us. - Right. - l agree with Yvonne. And Keld, too. - lt's all your fault. - Hey, do you mind me? No, Egon, we don't. Important things are at stake here. We have to consider Borge's future. He's not a child anymore. We don't want him to grow up in a criminal environment. I have fault too, I have been far too lenient. Borge has to be protected from evil, women, and booze. - He's going get a job in the EAC. - The EAC? And they want young people of good breeding. Preferably you should live in uptown Gentofte. You have to be neat and short cut, and have no contact with insane or convicts. Therefore we can not associate with you anymore. I see. So you don't want to hear my plan? - No, we don't. - Shut up. At least listen to me. Egon is right. Let him speak. Our money is still in the country. lt has been changed to gold bars. I know where the gold bars are. It'll be shipped out on Wednesday. - Wednesday? - We'll have to hurry. - We want no part of this, we go the road of the law. - Shut up. The gold is ours. But we'll have to dispose of it. It has to be laundered. How? I met a lawyer who knows a Norwegian oil manufacturer. He's willing to buy the gold for shares in the l.C. Lauridsen Line. I'll be chairman of the board, and you can be deputy directors. And then no one can touch us. We don't have to leave the country. We can live in uptown Gentofte. And Borge will get a job in the EAC. - What do you think? - Yvonne and I are not interested. Yvonne has made up her mind. So we'll have to ask you to leave. What are you saying, Keld? I never said that. But you said ... There's no need to be harsh. Egon has apologized now. - Apologized? - But you said that insane and convicts... Let us bear with him now. To error is human. So let's be co-operative. We wouldn't want people to say... - If you say so. - But it's not an easy decision. And we have certain conditions. We have to get the money by Wednesday next week. That's the whole idea. And if something goes wrong, it's your fault. - And you'll go to prison. As usual. - Of course. And finally you have to talk Borge into getting a haircut. - Did she also get in with you? - Pardon? About my hair. - It is a bit long, isn't it? - That EAC business is stupid. - I don't want to get a job there. - lt means a lot to your mom. lt means a lot to all of us. You too? lt all depends on you. - Then I'll do it. For you. - Thanks, Borge. - Bloody good, Egon. - Let's get started. - Just say the word. - We'll need some equipment. An old truck, can be used, a ladder, and a coat rack. We'll have to buy all of this. It'll cost us about 10,000 crowns. - 10,000? But how? - I have a plan. We'll need three balloons, a stop watch, and an empty bottle. - I have some balloons. - And l'll empty this one. Don't just sit there. I'm seeing the real-estate guy about the house next Wednesday. - House? - Yes, the house in Gentofte. We already discussed that. It's best to pay cash and since we have it. Let's get going. Corporation of 29th of November 1974. Their office is on the 6th floor. - Now! - 12 seconds. They own a lot of slot machines which are placed in different bars. The owner is in jail at the moment. His bodyguard Brian is in charge. He's armed and dangerous. He collects the money from the slot machines on Fridays. - We'll steal it. - But he's dangerous. Don't worry. He'll go to his office and put the money in a safe. 38 seconds after his arrival he's up on the 6th floor. lt takes him 16 seconds to reach his office. We hit him 30 seconds later. A total of 1 minute and 24 seconds. - Bloody good. - lt's just like in the old days. - We screw them all over. You're a genius. - How did it go? - Smooth. - But it was a bit dangerous. lt was great. - Holy moley, a lot. - What's that? - 25 cents. - What's that for? - That's Egon's plan. - 25 cents coins? I told you what's at stake here, Egon. And all you bring me is small change. What can you get for a 25 cent? You're all talk and no go. You said you knew where the gold is. It's in there. This is the Danish branch of the multinational Swiss syndicate. Their private railway is connected to the state railway system. And the wagon you see there is no ordinary wagon. It's an armored wagon. - Made by Franz Jäger in Berlin. - Good old Franz. It's for special deliveries. And our gold will be placed in it. And then what? Then what? - Then nothing more. - Nothing? It's no use anyway. I just wanted to show you where the gold is. - Please, Egon. You know Yvonne. - She doesn't mean it that bad. Maybe. But it still hurts. I know how you feel, Egon. I know Yvonne very well. But it's my experience that it will pass. You just need some friends. Friends who really understand you. You can count on us. But you can't count on broads. - You're very kind. - We're with you all the way. - We'll always stick together. - One for one, and all on their own. Let's go. Listen. I have a plan. Not just a plan, but a timetable. My plan has been adapted to the state railway's timetable. No other institution is as punctual and accurate. lt's a great pleasure. There's the 3745. The time is 2:34 pm. Right on the minute. From track 12 it passes switch 242 and changes to track 24. Notice how the signals change and everything fits together. G3745 going to Roskilde, Glumsoe and Naestved is on time. This is a constant source of pleasure to me, Mr. Godtfredsen. lt's wonderful to work with things that subordinate to a higher order. - Like cogs in a big, beautiful wheel. - You're right. And here's the coffee. There's Valby and Vigerslev. And further out is Glostrup. This is where our gold is being loaded on the wagon. The gold is packed in wooden boxes and disguised as art work. The wagon will be connected to the 5870 bound for Zürich via Basel. Copenhagen here. Everything is fine. It'll arrive in Zürich Friday at 8:22. The wagon leaves here tomorrow at 7:15. We'll pick it up an hour before that. Is the truck ready? - Yes, full tank and all. - We get the wagon at 6:15. Then we'll go to Glostrup and await the P3742 for Kalundborg. Then we can go on to block 14. There we'll await the G4711 at 7:22. And then we'll go to the pier. The rest of the way we work the switches manually. - Are you sure? - l know their timetable by heart. - Bloody good. And then what? - Then we'll reload before they miss it. We bring the gold to the Norwegian oil company Dovre Oil in Kastrup. - Then we get the shares. - Great. - But how? - How what? - How will we get the wagon? - Do you have the coat rack? - Is it a nice coat rack? - Yes, I painted it myself. It's a question of caps. I'm here with the new rack. Hello. - Done? - Yes, it looks nice. Stop that foolishness. Do you have the key, Keld? - Yes. And there's a whistle, too. - Let's go. - Bloody smart. - Get it started. - Can you do it? - Sure. Not that way. - Which way then? - The other way. Stop. Come on, Keld. The foreman wanted to be here. And he won't be here until the next hour. - We can't wait for that. - Maybe you made a mistake. The railways don't make mistakes. - We don't want to waste our time. Very well. 3742 can be here any moment now. - Would you change the signal? - With pleasure. - There's 3742. Right on time. - Of course. That's odd. There's a pig with a freight car on track 12. - Nobody told us. - It's probably a trainee. They're totally incompetent. By the way, the Railway Board wants to send a trainee out here. Oh, my, my. - Great. - lt's like being a boy again. - And we're going to be millionaires by it. - And when we're deputy directors. we need to work every day. - Yes, you'll be in charge. - And you'll chase secretaries. Stop that disgusting racket. We're there in a moment. We'll pull up by the truck and dispose of this machine so no one notices. The police patrol the area, but we'll have time to reload. Hurry, Keld. - What? Do you call that thing a truck? - It's okay. lt works fine. Christ! The stepladder. Here you are. - Take your time. - That's a piece of cake. - Bloody good, Egon. - How do you do it? - Let's get on with it. - Leave it to us, Egon. Relax, you don't do all. - You're in charge. - Come on, Keld. - Lift it, Keld. - l can't. - What now? - lt's heavy. - Of course. lt's gold. - You said it was easy. Stop that foolishness. We need to done before the police's next round. - Would you answer that? - With pleasure, Mr. Brodersen. Yes, speaking. - That's impossible. - What's wrong? It's from the ferry. There's a wagon missing. We're very sorry. We'll look for it. I'm so sorry. - Impossible. What'll we do? - Don't worry, Mr. Brodersen. - I'll check it. - Thank you, Mr. Godtfredsen. Hurry. - I'm exhausted. Let's leave the rest. - Never! Go on. - Let's have a break. - Shut up, you flabby nincompoops. You want to be millionaires, but when the going gets tough you give up on Borge's future. ... And Yvonne's. I'll do it. - The coffee is ready. - I don't want any. - We'll find the wagon soon. - But till then... Yes, of course. I respect that. Hurry. That's the last box. - Hurry. We've wasted too much time. - Let's have a beer. There they are. Let's get out of here. - What about me? - Jump. No! Of all the idiots, you're the... - Run. - Come on, Keld. - Hurry. - Wait for Keld. What is it? A wagon? Call the Railway Board. lt's not my problem, I have enough. I'm busy. Cheers for our noble force cheers for all our partners... POLICE PICNIC ON SUNDAY Wonderful. Where? Thank you very much. We'll pick it up. Pardon? We'll just load it again. The client needs their shipment. Thank you. Goodbye. - The police found the wagon. - Really? - That's wonderful. - Cooperation is a splendid thing. Life isn't half bad. Cheers for our force so noble and big cheers for our brother officers who are on the beat and cheers for our chief who knows right from wrong he's a man who knows no defeat swing your baton, my friend and smack 'em in the head all the ladies smile and wink at the boss who is seated here amongst us - What do you think, Holm? - lt sounds great, sir. I had to change it a few times because the chief will be there. We have to get some funny hats. You know the chief loves that. - You'll take care of that. - Concerning this case... - You know the 90 million. - I don't want to hear another word. This is the chance of a lifetime. And if I can solve this case... Chance! Listen to me, my friend. I've been 25 years on the force. And why do you think I'm still just a detective sergeant? Because I realized it wasn't about solving cases. Bring misfortune. It only leads to overtime, ulcers, divorce, and human tragedy. Degradation and humiliation. - Not about solving cases, it's all about promotions. - Yes, but... After years of hard work l've finally become chairman of the picnic board. That's what it's all about. A great picnic never goes unnoticed. I've arranged for a picnic wagon, and I've composed a song. And I've invited the ladies from the vice squad. - You'll have to do your part. - But I'll be on duty. There are lots of things to do. You could buy the funny hats. - I'd like to look into this case... - Just do your job. If you must solve crimes, you do it on your own time. Just stay there, Keld. Then I'll fix a poultice for you. No, it's too much for a human. You're a couple of whimps. All this whining for a few boxes. - But, Egon ... - Shut up. This is all your fault. - My fault? - Yes. That truck was a junk pile as usually. You don't get much for a pile of small change. - It's all because Keld is so fat. - What? - You're simply too fat. - I'm not fat, I'm just sturdy. - You're a blimp. - That's not true. You are a bit overweight, Keld. You should lose a few pounds. - Shut up! - What's the matter, honey? - Don't take it like that. - I know what you're all thinking. - "That fat fool." - Stop it, Keld. But behind all this beats a bleeding father's heart. - Don't get started now, Keld. - Stop that babbling. Shut up, you insane woman. I can't stand you people. Do you know how it feels to be in jail for weeks and months? Planning and timing it all. Memorizing the railway timetable. And when you're finally ready, you get stuck with the two of you. Lousy amateurs. Bunglers. Cowards. Crybabies. - Poultices. Christ! - Could I say something now? You don't show much consideration for Keld and Benny. But I'm not surprised. You're so full of hot air. Goodbye. l'm leaving now. l don't want to see you again. Goodbye forever. He just ran out on us. And now the police are here. - What? - The police. Egon promised that he'd be the one to go to jail. Let's get out of here. The backdoor! And then they leave it all to me. Just because I'm a housewife. - Further information? - I'm sorry to bother you but ... I've been to your office 17 times. And I was treated rather rudely. I'm very sorry about that. But I'm working on the case now. - And I promise you results. - It's about time. My husband worked on it himself. But the money had been changed to bullion and put on a wagon. And that was too much for Keld. He's a bit overweight, you see. He was going to be vice-president. And Borge could benefit from that. I have an option on a villa. And now I really don't know. I see. You said you saw the thief. Could you give me a description? Yes. Well, I didn't see him that clearly. It was a bit foggy, you see. - Was he tall and slim? - No, not really. He was chubby and ordinary. Chubby... and ordinary. Call for you. From Hamburg. It's me. Not there? Impossible. The wagon was picked up here. Sure. Of course it's possible. I'll look into it. Immediately. - I'm totally beat. - We'll have to find Egon. - I don't know where he is. - What would you do if you were him? - Go to bed. - Oh, shut up, you know Egon. I know what he would do. Look for the wagon. P3478. Of course. Tomorrow. The train to RedTown Ferry. - There it is. - Let's rest. - And there's Egon. - He's resting already. - There's that bastard again. - He's killed Egon. Let's give up. No, we have to do something. Come on, Keld. - Where's that going? - To Australia. - Not today. We're closing. - No hurry. - Come on. - What now? - We have to save Egon. - Don't you think he's dead. No, you know Egon. Bloody good. Egon! It's a laughing machine. That's Egon. He's up there. Don't worry, Egon. I'm coming. Stop it, Egon. Damn it, Egon... Just a sec, Egon. I'll have to get a crowbar. Quiet, Egon. We'll be back. There again! Those lazy, sloppy youths. Students and casual laborers. They have no respect for anything. Longhaired and filthy. And they just leave a mess behind. But they won't get away with it. I'll write a report on them. They should have a sound thrashing. That's the only thing they understand. It's not funny. Come on, Buster. We're back, Egon. Give me a hand, Keld. - What? - We have to carry him out. I'm not carrying anything. You can't make me do it. - It's for Borge's sake. - It's inhuman. Okay, I'll handle it. Open the gate. Don't worry, Egon. I'm sorry about that. Get a crowbar. Bloody good. I could have done without the dog. Never mind. I've got a plan. - What plan is that? - I've planned it all. We'll need four nails, two pieces of copper wire, and a newspaper. - And Borge has to help us. - It's all for his sake anyway. The wagon will be put on the P3478 bound for Zürich. It departs at 7:46 am tomorrow. We'll stop it and get the wagon. - Bloody good. - Do we unload the boxes again? No, we'll drive the wagon all the way to Kastrup. It is possible! - So we're not carrying the boxes? - No. - Then I'm in. - Fine. You talk to Borge. He'll meet us at 7 o'clock. The operation starts at sunrise, the tracks are free then. - When? - At 3:35 am. - Stop it! - It's damned early. - I'm sore all over. - At least you got some sleep, I studied the timetable. - I don't understand it. - Did you explain it to him? Somebody's coming. It's a man. - What the...? - What has happened to you, Borge? He looks like a girl. Egon told me to do it. - Did you...? - lt's for his own good. He'll have to wear a cap. Give it to me. - Stop it. - Yes, stop it. Get the newspaper. Put it in the cap. Listen carefully. - Will you stop it, Benny! - It's not funny. Give me the nails. When the train comes at track 6, you short-circuit the fuses. Then the signal will turn red, and the train will stop. Got it? - Sure, but if somebody shows up? - Then tell them you're a trainee. Stop it, Benny. lt's 7:38 am. The P3478 leaves in exactly 8 minutes. - Good morning, Mr. Godtfredsen. - Good morning, Mr. Brodersen. A blessed morning. - lt's a big day today. - And a Sunday, too. I brought some cake. lt's the most beautiful day of the year. - The hard winter is over. - The summer timetable takes effect. The flag is flying in honor of the summer timetable. The first thing on our agenda is the P3478 leaving at 8:28 am. I took the liberty of having the lost wagon connected to P3478. Fine, it's a nice wagon, so nobody will mind it. There's also a excursion wagon, PT1448, connected to P3478. It will be disconnected in Roskilde. They will visit the cathedral. - It should have been here. - Maybe it's been delayed. - There he is. The new trainee. - My, my. On a day like this. Hello, young man. Are you the new trainee? Then come in here. - He's coming now. - Oh, my, my. He looks rather likable. He's not even longhaired. - He is a fine young man and wears glasses. - We've brighter days in store. It's almost 8:28. We'll have to look out for P3478. This is outrageous. What would I have done without the funny hats? - Have a nice time. - I sure hope so. This means that a train has left. In a moment it will pass here. If we have to give a green signal. We do that by pushing this button. There. This is how it works. Isn't it amazing? - lt's P3478 coming now, right? - Yes, P3478 bound for Redtown. Via Roskilde, Ringsted, Naestved, Vordingborg and Nykobing. - Isn't it late? Shouldn't it leave at 7:46? - In the summer it leaves at 8:28. Our young friend knows the timetable by heart. There it is. Right on time. Scandalous. If you can't trust the railways who can you trust? - What'll we do? - There's a train coming. That's it. Get it started. Change the signal, Borge. - What the hell is he waiting for? - Come on, Borge. I hope you'll come to love this job as much as l do. - Order and punctuality are great. - The coffee's ready. - I'll get the cups. - I'll get the buttercake. - At last! - I knew we could trust Borge. That's not our wagon. - I don't understand it. - Have we failed again? - I knew it. What do we do now? - I've got it! They're drunk as skunks. We'll just take them with us. - Good thinking. - But will it work? Good morning. Why did you stop us? I don't understand it. The track should be open. Can you see anything out there? Then I'll give you a go-signal. Have a nice trip. - Can you explain this? - No. It must be some interference. - Aurora borealis or something. - You're probably right. - It sounds beautiful. - Bllody drunk and on rollerscates. And on a Sunday! We're on the right track. - It's the police. In that wagon. - Impossible. - I never heard the police sing. - What are we going to do? We have to unhitch them. - We'll get them off the track. - Take care of the switch, Keld. CARLSBERG BREWERY - Another piece? - No, thank you. - We'll save the rest, then. - Where do you live? - In Valby. - Really? So do I. A lot of us live in Valby. - Oh, you don't live in Valby. - Unfortunately, no. - But it's close. I live in Vanlose. - lt's not quite the same. What does your father do? He takes the train a lot. - Bloody good, Egon. - You did fine. And Keld, too. You just have to switch the track. And nothing can go wrong now. - We'll just follow Egon's plan. - We follow the timetable. We'll stop at the switch. We'll let the P1937 pass. It'll come towards us in 45 seconds. - What the hell was that? - It came from the wrong direction. - I don't understand it. - You said you knew the timetable. - It must be a special train. - Yes, of course. Let's go to the main fuse box. We'll have to change the signal. I hope we don't run into more special trains. Keld! Damn it, Egon. - It's impossible. - You almost got us killed. - I know the timetable by heart. - Maybe they changed it. They can't use the same timetable all the time. - Of course. I'm an idiot. - I kind of agree there. The summer timetable. It takes effect today. - So what do we do now? - There's only one thing to do. Where are you going? There. Block 16 is clear. The line is open now. All in order. You can stay here and watch it. - I'll do the dishes. - Fine, Godtfredsen. Let's go. - What did you do? - It'll take them a while to sort it out. - Oh, my God. What's happening? - I knew this would happen today. What are we to do? What will the Chairman say to this? THE TRAIN SERVICE IS IRREGULAR - It's broken down. What to do? - I don't know, Karl Marx went into it. Of course, Mr. Chairman. At once. That was the Chairman of the Board. He wants us to clear this up now. - We're finished. - Why should this happen to you? Maybe it's the fuse box down there. Pardon? - There. - But how? It was just the main fuse. I have the supreme pleasure to announce that all is well again, sir. The whole thing was solved by an extremely bright trainee. I will do that, sir. Thank you. - The Chairman told me to thank you. - You're welcome. - This calls for a cup of coffee. - I've put it on already. Sit down, Mr. Jensen. Then I'll get the cake. - What do I do now? - Stop and wait. - Wake up. You'll be president soon. - Vice-president. - Are we sailing? - No, we're almost at Amager. - So it's all over now? - Yes, nothing can go wrong now. - What'll I do now, Egon? - Just follow the tracks. STRICTLY NO ENTRANCE - It's been like a journey. - It's like going out to the other side of the country. - It's beautiful. - And peaceful. You've done it again, Egon. You're a genius. - Without you we would be nothing. - Right. And now we're going to be vice presidents. Bloody good. - But Egon will be in charge. - I'm chairman of the board. - You're the leader. - And the responsibility rests on me. No evil can befall us. I didn't know they had tracks out here. - Are there any trains? - No, the line is closed. - It's a one track line. - That's good enough for us. What's that? - It's him. - That bastard. - What are we going to do, Egon? - Keep going. - Come on. - I'm going as fast as I can. - Shunt it to the sliding track. - Is Keld ready? Come on, Keld. The police. - Let's get out of here. - But we can't ... Come on, Egon. Holm speaking. A wagon? A Franz Jäger? Can you describe the culprit? Chubby and ordinary. That's the man. I'm on my way. The case is solved! Hi there, chum. - The chief! I'm so sorry. - Oh, are you there, Jensen. - A great picnic, Jensen. - Thank you. You're still just detective sergeant. We should do something about that. You're a valuable officer. - Don't be sad. - It's all my fault. - It doesn't matter. - I've let you down. - I'm no good. - We've had a good time, Egon. We've been riding trains and all. We'll be millionaires another time. But what about Yvonne? I'll talk to Yvonne. That's the least I can do. Let's go. Glad to see you, Egon. I have a question for you. You're never here when I need you. So I've fixed it all myself. The police want to know where to send the wagon. If you'll just call, the railways will deliver it. And I've taken care of Borge, too. I don't want him in the EAC anyway. He's got a job with the railways. So we don't have to move. They like us to live here in Valby. And maybe he could become Chairman of the Railway Board. So if you'll just call everything should be okay. Howdy. We can get our shares now. And Egon can be chairman. We'll be honest citizens now. And nobody can harm us anymore. CHAIRMAN - Good morning, Mrs. Hansen. - There's a gentleman to see you. - I've got three and a half minutes. - He just needs three minutes. Enter. - How do you do? - Be brief and to the point. You're Mr. Egon Olsen? You're chairman of the board? - And you have full responsibility? - Of course. You have bought the majority of shares for 90 million, right? - Yes, but why? - I'm from the IRS. You have not filed your income with us. You'll have to pay tax, and fines amounting to ... 270 million. How can we settle this? --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
