Abby Epstein: DID YOU EVER CONSIDER USING A MIDWIFE? I NEVER DID. I-- I WOULD NOT. TO SAY I WAS EVEN FAMILIAR WITH THE WORD-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WAS. I THOUGHT IT MEANT, YOU KNOW, HAVING THE BABY IN A BARN SOMEWHERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I WOULD THINK-- THAT WOULD HAVE A TYPE OF BIRTH LIKE THIS. Cara Muhlhahn: SHE'S HAVING HER BABY ON THE FULL MOON. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A FULL MOON. Abby: WOULD YOU EVER HAVE CONSIDERED USING A MIDWIFE? PROBABLY NOT. I LIKE THE DOCTOR ASPECT OF IT. IT'S JUST-- IT'S DONE. IT'S SURGERY. ONE, TWO, THREE, YOU KNOW. ( quietly ) IT'S ME. ( whispering ) THE DOOR WAS OPEN DOWNSTAIRS, SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO RING. HOW IS SHE DOING? - YEAH. FEEL IT. - RIGHT. YOU CAN JUST PRETEND I'M NOT HERE. IF IT'S TOO EARLY, IT'S TOO EARLY. I'M JUST RIGHT THERE. JUST DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO. OKAY. ( moaning ) MATERNITY CARE IN THE UNITED STATES IS IN A CRISIS. IT'S IN MANY WAYS A DISASTER. MEDICAL DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR MONETARY AND LEGAL REASONS, NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER AND THE BABY. Abby Wain: TECHNOLOGY IS TECHNOLOGY. IT'S NOT STOPPING. THIS IS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE GOOD STUFF, YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE IT TO GET THE BEST OUTCOME. Tina Cassidy: WE SHOULD CONSTANTLY BE ASKING OURSELVES, "IS THIS AN IMPROVEMENT OR ARE WE MAKING THINGS WORSE?" Woman: IF WE DON'T QUICKLY TAKE AHOLD OF THIS, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE NORMAL BIRTH. Michael Brodman: I CALL IT "FEMINIST MACHOISM," WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING YOUR BABY IN A STROLLER THREE MONTHS LATER, TO SAY, "I DID IT NATURALLY." PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. Elan Vital McAllister: THERE IS SO LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THIS PROCESS IS TO A WOMAN. Eugene Declerq: THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE NATURE OF CARE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT'S TROUBLESOME. WOMEN HAVE BEEN TOLD FOR YEARS NOW THAT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN BIRTH PROCESS. Nadine Goodman: BASICALLY, WHAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS DONE OVER THE LAST 40-50 YEARS IS CONVINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO BIRTH. MY FIRST INSTINCT IS, "HOW MANY BIRDS HAD TO DIE FOR THIS?" Mayra: THIS WOMAN COMES UP TO ME AND SHE GOES, "SO WHAT KIND OF BIRTH ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE?" AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?" YOU KNOW? AND SHE SAID, "WELL, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE INDUCED?" AND I WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU--? SHE'S REALLY ASKING ME THIS." I WAS LIKE, "I'M NOT GOING TO BE INDUCED. THE BABY'S GOING TO COME WHEN HE'S GOOD AND READY." - Woman: WOW. - Mayra: AND SHE SAID, "OH, WELL, I JUST HEARD HOW NEW YORK WOMEN ARE ALL SCHEDULING THEIR BIRTHS AND THEY'RE CALLING IT 'DESIGNER BIRTH.'" I WAS LIKE, "A DESIGNER BIRTH?" AND SHE GOES, "YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SCHEDULE YOUR DELIVERY, YOU SCHEDULE YOUR CAESAREAN AND THEN THEY DO A TUMMY TUCK RIGHT AFTERWARDS." AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, THOSE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE MUCH BIGGER PARTIES TO ATTEND TO THAN I DO." ( laughs ) Man: IT'S ALREADY SO GORGEOUS, I DON'T WANT TO SAY. ( all cheering ) Jen: I STARTED GOING TO A MIDWIFE FOR WELL WOMAN CARE SEVEN YEARS AGO. UNLESS I HAD A PROBLEM, I CAN'T IMAGINE GOING BACK TO AN OB/GYN. THE CARE IS GREAT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT JUST MAKE SENSE. WHAT WAS STARTLING TO ME WAS THAT IF YOU'RE DELIVERING WITH A TRADITIONAL DOCTOR YOU MIGHT GO IN AND HAVE A PLAN AND IT MIGHT CHANGE PRETTY QUICKLY BASED ON A DOCTOR'S DECISION WHICH DIDN'T SEEM NECESSARILY-- UNLESS THERE WERE MEDICAL REASONS FOR IT, YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TRY - TO STICK TO YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN. - YEAH. HI THERE. THANK YOU. Ricki Lake: WHEN I HAD MY FIRST CHILD, I WENT IN WANTING THE NATURAL BIRTH EXPERIENCE. AND I ENDED UP HAVING A LOT OF WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION. AND I FELT THAT I WAS SOMEHOW CHEATED FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT I INITIALLY WENT AFTER. AND I FELT LIKE IF I WERE EVER TO DO IT AGAIN, I WANTED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND SO I STARTED TO GET MY HANDS ON EVERYTHING I COULD. I WENT TO BIRTH CONFERENCES. I STARTED TO GET EDUCATED ON ALL THESE ISSUES. THIS IS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY GOT ME SO INSPIRED. I SAW HER SPEAK AT THE BIRTHING CONFERENCE. - LOOK AT THIS BOOK. - OH MY GOD. LOOK AT HER, WITH HER BRAIDS. IT DOESN'T GET MORE GRANOLA THAN THIS, - BUT SHE BLEW MY MIND. - REALLY? MAYBE WE CAN INTERVIEW HER WHEN SHE'S DOING A CONFERENCE OR SOMETHING. IT BECAME MY PASSION AND I WANTED TO DO A PROJECT WHERE I COULD EXPLORE THE SYSTEM OF BIRTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND RAISE QUESTIONS AS TO, YOU KNOW, ARE WE BENEFITING MOTHERS AND BABIES OR NOT? CAN I PUT THE TUBE IN THE BABY'S HEAD? - ONLY IF I CAN DO THE EPISIOTOMY. - OKAY. VERY FEW DOCTORS HAVE EVER OBSERVED A NORMAL BIRTH IN MEDICAL SCHOOL OR IN A HOSPITAL. IT'S ALMOST AN OXYMORON. Abby: HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET TO SEE A FULLY NATURAL BIRTH? - RARELY. - ALMOST NEVER. WELL, I ALWAYS SAY THAT MIDWIVES DO A BETTER JOB AT THE NORMAL DELIVERIES THAN WE DO. FOR A NORMAL, LOW-RISK WOMAN IT'S OVERKILL GOING TO A DOCTOR. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH. THE DOCTOR'S NOT REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THINGS WHEN THEY'RE NORMAL. THE E.E.G., THE B.P. MONITOR - AND THE A.V.V. - YES, CERTAINLY, DOCTOR. AND GET THE MACHINE THAT GOES "PING!" BECAUSE OBSTETRICIANS ARE SOCIALIZED TO SEARCH FOR PATHOLOGY, THEY OFTEN SEE PATHOLOGY WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST. THEY FIND PATHOLOGY BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO. CLEAR! AN OBSTETRICIAN IS A TRAINED SURGEON AND USUALLY VERY VERY GOOD AT WHAT HE OR SHE DOES. AND THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE THEM. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE OBSTETRICIANS. THEY'RE SURGEONS. THEY SHOULD BE DOING SURGERY ALL DAY EVERY DAY WHEN IT'S NEEDED. THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING NORMAL BIRTHS 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRAINED IN IT. THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT. EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. YOU CAN GO TO GREAT BRITAIN, YOU CAN GO TO FRANCE, GERMANY, SCANDINAVIA, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN-- GO TO ALL THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE LOSING FEWER WOMEN AND FEWER BABIES AROUND THE TIME OF BIRTH, AND WHAT DO YOU SEE? YOU SEE MIDWIVES ATTENDING 70 OR 80% OF ALL THE BIRTHS. AND THE DOCTORS ARE THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THE SMALL PERCENT THAT DEVELOP THE COMPLICATIONS. THAT IS A PROVEN SYSTEM EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THE UNITED STATES STANDS ALONE. Eugene Declerq: THE UNITED STATES IS RANKED POORLY IN TERMS OF INFANT MORTALITY. IF YOU LOOK ONLY AT THE SEVEN COUNTRIES THAT HAD AT LEAST 400,000 BIRTHS, IT'S LAST. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT'S MADE IS THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT WOMEN, THAT WE HAVE MORE HIGH-RISK WOMEN. BUT THIS BLAMING OF WOMEN IS FARCICAL. IT'S NOT ABOUT MOTHERS. IT'S ABOUT THE WAY WE TREAT THE CARE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT NOBODY EVER WANTS TO ADMIT THERE'S A DIFFICULTY INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM. Ina May Gaskin: THIS IS THE OUTCOME WHEN YOU'RE A CENTURY OR SO POST-MIDWIVES. YOU LOSE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE. AND WE'RE THE ONE COUNTRY-- WHEN BIRTH WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL, THE MIDWIVES DIDN'T GO THERE WITH IT. Davis-Floyd: IN THE EARLY 1900s PHYSICIANS, MOSTLY IN THE EAST, BUT ALSO IN THE DEEP SOUTH TO SOME EXTENT, WENT ON A VERY EFFECTIVE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST MIDWIVES. THEY WOULD MAKE POSTERS SHOWING A BLACK GRANNY MIDWIFE IN A VERY POOR HOME DELIVERING A BABY AND SAYING, "WOULD YOU WANT THIS KIND OF PERSON TO DELIVER YOUR BABY?" Tina Cassidy: IT WAS SORT OF A CULTURAL SHIFT WHERE MIDWIVES WERE PORTRAYED AS A VESTIGE OF THE OLD COUNTRY. THEY WERE DIRTY. THEY WERE IGNORANT. THEY WERE ILLITERATE. AND SO HOSPITALS WERE OFFERED AS THIS GLEAMING, WONDERFUL PLACE WHERE YOU COULD GO AND HAVE A BABY THAT WOULD BE CLEANER AND SAFER. THE REALITY OF COURSE WAS THAT GIVING BIRTH WITH AN OBSTETRICIAN AT THAT TIME WAS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN GIVING BIRTH WITH A MIDWIFE BECAUSE DOCTORS WERE GRADUATING FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL-- MANY OF THEM HAD NOT WITNESSED A LIVE BIRTH BEFORE THEY SET OUT TO PRACTICE. Nadine Goodman: WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE OB/GYN SPECIALTY HOSPITALS STARTED TO SPROUT UP AND THOSE PROFESSIONALS STARTED TO MULTIPLY AND THEY NEEDED A JOB. YOU KNOW, BUSINESS TOOK OVER. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CONCEPT OF NORMAL CHANGED. OBSTETRICS-- I'VE SAID IT IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"-- MY WIFE IS MAD AT THE WAY I SAY IT, SO I'LL SAY IT THE WAY SHE WANTS ME TO-- IT'S 98% NOT EXCITING AND 2% SHEER TERROR. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE 2% TERROR IS GONNA HAPPEN. AND IT GOES FROM BEING COMPLETELY NORMAL TO 2% TERROR. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL-- AND I DON'T LIKE HOSPITALS IN GENERAL, THE IDEA, THEY'RE NOT HEALING PLACES IN GENERAL, BUT THEY ARE GOOD FOR WHEN YOU HAVE THAT TERROR. MY ISSUE IS, FOR THOSE WOMEN THAT HAVE THE NORMAL-- THE 90% THAT HAVE NO COMPLICATIONS, THEY COME TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY'RE PUT THROUGH THESE-- IT'S THE SYSTEM WHERE THEY'RE FLAT ON THEIR-- - IT IS TOTALLY THAT. - IF THEY WANT A NATURAL BIRTH, IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A VAGINAL BIRTH, ALL THESE THINGS ARE - STACKED UP AGAINST THEM. - ABSOLUTELY. THEY'VE TOLD WOMEN, "COME TO US. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY'S BIRTH. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF BIRTH YOU WANT. WE'RE OPEN TO ANYTHING." AND THEN YOU GET THERE AND YOU REALIZE, "NO, THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM IS REALLY SET UP ONE WAY, TO HANDLE ONE KIND OF BIRTH. AND YOU JUST GET PUT THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. AND IT'S A FIGHT TO TRY TO NOT GET PUT THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. OH, SHE HAS TWO TO THREE 90? EXCELLENT. ON PITOCIN. THIS IS PITOCIN, WHICH IS THE MEDICATION GIVEN THROUGH THE I.V. THAT CAUSES CONTRACTIONS. ROOM 2, INDUCTION IS DOING FINE. JUST CHECK THAT SHE'S ON PIT. HOW MUCH DEMEROL WERE YOU GONNA GIVE? ROOM 3, BEING INDUCED. GIVE THE EQUIVALENT OF STADOL. MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING UP ON THE PIT. JUST MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S ON PIT AND THAT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING WITH HER INDUCTION. "PIT HER" MEANS BASICALLY INSTRUCTING THE NURSE TO START PITOCIN. I ASKED TO KEEP UPPING THE PIT. PROBABLY ABOUT 90% OF OUR PATIENTS AT SOME POINT ARE ON SOME TYPE OF AUGMENTATION. SHE'S NOT ANYWHERE NEAR ADEQUACY, SO WE HAVE TO KEEP UPPING THE PIT. IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING THAT CHANGE IN THAT SEGMENT OF TIME THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, THEN WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FACILITATE THINGS. MAYBE START PIT. UP HER PITOCIN. PIT AT 6:30. HOSPITALS ARE BUSINESSES. THEY WANT THOSE BEDS FILLED AND EMPTIED. THEY DON'T WANT WOMEN HANGING AROUND IN THE LABOR ROOM. Woman: YOU HAD THIS FEELING AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE THERE WAS A LIMIT TO HOW LONG YOU CAN BE IN LABOR, LIKE, "OH, IT'S BEEN 12 HOURS, SO NOW YOU NEED PITOCIN." I DID KNOW THE PRESSURE WAS ON AS WE GOT INTO 20 HOURS, 21 HOURS. AT THE HOSPITAL I HAD PITOCIN. AND THEN THAT MADE ME ITCHY, SO THEY GIVE YOU SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOUR ITCHING. I KNEW ONCE THEY GAVE YOU THAT PITOCIN, YOU NEED THE EPIDURAL. FEEL BETTER NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE EPIDURAL? OH MY GOD, YES. AND THEN THINGS COME ON REALLY STRONG, SO THEN YOU GET AN EPIDURAL. AND IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE, WE CAN ALWAYS GIVE YOU MORE. IT WAS VERY EASY FOR THEM TO START DOING THINGS THAT WE HADN'T REALLY WANTED THEM TO DO, LIKE PITOCIN AND WHATNOT, BECAUSE I ALREADY HAD THE I.V. IN MY ARM. THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU THE OPTION. AND THEN ANOTHER EPIDURAL 'CAUSE NOTHING WAS HAPPENING. YOU'RE HAVING YOUR CONTRACTIONS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T FEEL THE PAIN. AUTOMATICALLY, THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, YOU NEED AN EPIDURAL. WE'LL GET THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST." SO SHE'S GETTING HER EPIDURAL. THEN WE'LL PUT IN THE FOLEY BULB FOR INDUCTION. THEY GAVE ME ANOTHER DRUG CALLED STADOL. 17 HOURS OF PITOCIN. THEY GAVE ME THAT AND I REMEMBER THAT MADE ME-- I WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON? THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG." CERVIDIL IS THE END. ONCE CERVIDIL HAPPENED, ANY CHANCE BEYOND THAT WAS GONE. IT WAS GONE. I HATED THAT DRUG. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ONCE THEY STARTED AN INTERVENTION, THEY ALL JUST KIND OF-- IT WAS A DOMINO EFFECT. THE WHOLE THING IS LIKE A BIG SNOWBALL EFFECT. Davis-Floyd: IN THE HOSPITAL, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE VERY LONG LABORS. SO IF YOU'RE NOT DILATING RAPIDLY, WHICH YOU'RE LIKELY NOT TO DO IF YOU GET AN EPIDURAL EARLY IN LABOR, YOU WILL BE GIVEN PITOCIN. THEY'LL PUT THE PITOCIN IN THE I.V. IT WILL FLOW INTO YOUR VEINS. PITOCIN MAKES CONTRACTIONS LONGER AND STRONGER AND CLOSER TOGETHER. SO THEN THE PAIN OF LABOR IS MUCH WORSE. SO YOU GO WITH THAT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE EPIDURAL, BUT EVENTUALLY THE PAIN OF THE CONTRACTIONS IS OVERWHELMING THE EPIDURAL. YOU NEED TO UP THE EPIDURAL. AND THEN LABOR SLOWS DOWN MORE BECAUSE OF THAT, SO THEN YOU NEED MORE PITOCIN. NOW YOU'RE NOT FEELING THE PAIN OF THE EXTRA PITOCIN BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE EPIDURAL, BUT YOUR BABY IS GETTING COMPRESSED BLOOD AND OXYGEN SUPPLY BECAUSE PITOCIN CONTRACTIONS LAST SO LONG AND ARE SO STRONG, THE BLOOD AND OXYGEN FLOW TO THE BABY IS COMPROMISED. SO THEN THE BABY IS LIKELY TO GO INTO DISTRESS AND THEN YOU'RE SENT OFF FOR AN EMERGENCY CESAREAN FROM THE BABY IN DISTRESS FROM CONTRACTIONS INDUCED BY THE PITOCIN WHICH WAS NECESSITATED BY THE EPIDURAL. Declerq: STEP BY STEP, ONE INTERVENTION LEADS TO A SERIES OF INTERVENTIONS. AND THE NET RESULT IS, THE MOTHER FINALLY ENDS UP WITH A CESAREAN. AND EVERYBODY SAYS, "THANK GOD WE WERE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS INTERVENTION TO SAVE YOUR BABY." THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IF THEY DIDN'T START THE CASCADE OF INTERVENTIONS, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY. THERE IS CLEARLY AN ASSOCIATION WITH INDUCTION OF LABOR AND CESAREAN DELIVERY. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OBSTETRICS IN GENERAL, THERE'S BEEN A SERIES OF VERY INTENSE INTERVENTIONS THAT PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN DOING DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND THERE'S NOT A MEDICALLY JUSTIFIED REASON FOR DOING THOSE THINGS. EVEN COMMON SENSE-- I MEAN, THE IDEA OF LYING DOWN WITH YOUR LEGS UP BEING THE MOST COMFORTABLE OR LOGICAL POSITION TO GIVE BIRTH-- YOU KNOW? La Juana: THE MORE YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH YOUR LABOR AND THE MORE YOU CAN MOVE WITH CONTRACTIONS, THEY DON'T SEEM AS INTENSE. TO LAY STILL-- IT'S LIKE, "WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THIS? I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS BED AND MOVE MY HIPS." Davis-Floyd: THE LITHOTOMIC POSITION IS THE MOST PHYSIOLOGICALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL POSITION EVER INVENTED FOR BIRTH BECAUSE PUTTING THE MOTHER FLAT ON HER BACK LITERALLY MAKES THE PELVIS SMALLER, MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE WOMAN TO USE HER STOMACH MUSCLES TO PUSH, AND THEREFORE MAKES IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT AN EPISIOTOMY WILL BE CUT OR FORCEPS WILL BE USED OR THE VACUUM EXTRACTOR WILL BE USED. ( speaking Portuguese ) WHEN THE BABY GOES IN THE WOMB, SHE STARTS THE BIRTH LIKE THIS AND THEN GOES LIKE THIS. BUT WHEN HE FINDS A LITTLE SPOT HERE IN THE SPINE, THEN HE NEEDS TO DO LIKE THIS. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTHER PROBABLY IS GOING TO SHAKE THE PELVIS. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE BABY'S MOVING. AND THEN HE GOES A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND THEN HE NEEDS TO DO IT AGAIN. - PUSH. PUSH. PUSH. - COME ON. THAT'S IT. PUSH. PUSH. PUSH. WOMEN HERE HAVE GIVEN UP THEIR AUTONOMY ABOUT BIRTH. WOMEN ARE SO AFRAID OF BIRTH BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE AN IMAGE OF WHAT BIRTH LOOKS LIKE. WOMEN IN AMERICA DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NORMAL ABOUT BIRTH. THEY WATCH "A BABY STORY." THEY WATCH "MATERNITY WARD." THEY WATCH THESE PROGRAMS. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR INSTILLED IN WOMEN AROUND BIRTH. Sylvie Blaustein: EVERY BIRTH THAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION, IT'S WOMEN SCREAMING AND BEING RUSHED DOWN THE HALLWAY AND LOOKING IN ABSOLUTE DIRE EMERGENCY. SO WHY SHOULD WOMEN FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT GIVING BIRTH WHEN THE WHOLE CULTURE IS TELLING THEM THIS IS SCARY, THIS IS DANGEROUS? McAllister: WOMEN EXPECT TO HAVE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALL HAVING EPIDURALS-- BECAUSE THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF WHAT THIS IS. Ana Paula Markel: THE BIRTHS ON TELEVISION ARE VERY DRAMATIC. I WOULD BE EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED TOO IF I SAW THESE WOMEN STRAPPED. AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF DANGER-- THAT THE DOCTOR COMES IN AND SAVES THE WOMEN. MOMMY, THE BABY'S HEART RATE IS GOING A LITTLE BIT DOWN, OKAY? AND I DON'T LIKE THAT. SO NEXT CONTRACTION, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PUSH THE BABY OUT BY YOURSELF, I WILL HELP YOU WITH THE VACUUM. Markel: OBVIOUSLY, IF PEOPLE ARE PLAYING THE YOUR-BABY'S-IN-DANGER CARD, THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHEN THE BATTLE IS OVER. MOMMY, WE NEED TO DELIVER THIS BABY, OKAY? LISTEN TO ME. YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ABOUT YOUR CONTRACTION. AND PUSH! McAllister: THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT MANIPULATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED, IS WHEN A WOMAN STARTS TO QUESTION, 'WAIT, WHY DO WE NEED TO DO THIS? WAIT, IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN DO?" THE FIRST THING YOU TURN TO IS, "OH, IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF THE BABY." WHETHER OR NOT IT IS, YOU'LL DO ANYTHING, BECAUSE IF YOU GO ON TO QUESTION IT, WELL, THEN YOU'RE A BAD MOM, YOU KNOW? SO WHO'S GONNA DO THAT? IT'S BEEN ABOUT TWO HOURS, SO I RECOMMEND A VACUUM-ASSISTED DELIVERY. IT'S NOT AS IF I'M JUST GONNA PULL THE BABY OUT OF YOU. I'M JUST GONNA ASSIST IN YOUR EFFORTS, 'CAUSE IT'S TIME. Susan Hodges: YOU GET A ONE-SIDED STORY. AND IT'S VERY EASY TO CONVINCE A WOMAN TO HAVE THIS PROCEDURE, THAT PROCEDURE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE POWER DISPARITY. - WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE BABY? - MINIMAL. Hodges: SO IF YOU'RE IN LABOR AND THE DOCTOR SAYS, "WOW, I THINK WE NEED TO DO X," YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "YEAH, WE'D BETTER DO X." THE DOCTOR MAY THINK HE'S OFFERING YOU AN OPTION, BUT YOU HEAR THE EXPERT ADVISING YOU TO DO SOMETHING. - WHAT DO I DO? - NOTHING, DEAR. YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED. SEDATE HER! NUMBER THE CHILD. MEASURE IT, BLOOD-TYPE IT AND ISOLATE IT! I'm really, I'm totally curious about your project. I'm sorry I don't know more about your work, who you are and how long you've been working on this project and what got you interested or fascinated. OH, YEAH. WELL, I'M REALLY-- RICKI IS THE ONE WHO-- RICKI HAD TWO BIRTHS, THE SECOND ONE AT HOME. SO SHE BROUGHT ME INTO THIS JUST AS A FILMMAKER. AND THEN I JUST HAPPENED TO GET PREGNANT. Oh my God. Are you pregnant now? - YEAH. - Oh, congratulations! - That's awesome. - THANK YOU. ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO DO THIS PROJECT IS I WANTED TO EXPLORE, YOU KNOW-- FOR ME, HAVING THE TWO VERY DIFFERENT BIRTH EXPERIENCES, BOTH REALLY AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL-- BUT FOR ME, IT WAS JUST AS MUCH A PRIORITY TO HAVE THE MEMORY OF THE PROCESS OF BEING PREGNANT AND DELIVERING AND THE RITE OF PASSAGE AND REMEMBERING EVERYTHING, FEELING EVERYTHING. AND SO MANY OF MY PEERS AND WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. THEY JUST WANT THE END RESULT OF THE HEALTHY BABY IN THEIR ARMS. AND THEY DON'T CARE HOW IT GOT THERE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I REALLY WANTED TO EXPLORE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SO MANY WOMEN ARE MISSING THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY AND THIS LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE. I FEEL LIKE SO MUCH OF WHO I AM TODAY COMES FROM THAT EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW? Oh, I know. It's hugely transformative. And I think you're going to be transformed by your birth, - like it or not. - RIGHT. RIGHT. Markel: A WOMAN, AS LONG AS SHE LIVES, WILL REMEMBER HOW SHE WAS MADE TO FEEL AT HER BIRTH. THE WAY I'VE EXPLAINED BIRTH SOMETIMES-- AT LEAST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE-- TO PEOPLE, IS LIKE YOU SWITCH ON A LIGHT SWITCH AND YOU GO TO THE MOON. I MEAN, IT'S A DIFFERENT-- IT'S AN OTHERWORLDLY EXPERIENCE. NOTHING COMPARES TO THE PRIVILEGE OF GIVING LIFE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT-- NOTHING. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE REVERENCE AND THE RESPECT FOR THAT, WHERE DO YOU GO FROM THERE? Cara Muhlhahn: A WOMAN REALLY DOESN'T NEED TO BE RESCUED. IT'S NOT THE PLACE FOR THE KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR. IT'S THE PLACE FOR HER TO FACE HER DARKEST MOMENT AND LAY CLAIM TO HER VICTORY, SO THAT SHE CAN LAY CLAIM TO HER VICTORY AFTER SHE'S DONE IT, I THINK. McAllister: MANY PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED BIRTH AS A RITE OF PASSAGE. AND IT IS CERTAINLY A LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE. AND IT CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL, INCREDIBLE, EMPOWERING LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE, OR IT CAN BE A DEVASTATING, TRAUMATIC, SCARRING, LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY, EXPERIENCE. YEAH, WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT. MELVA? ( Melva crying ) I'M GOING TO GET DRUGGED. Nurse #1: MELVA, REMEMBER, NO CRYING. YOU'VE GOT TO BREATHE, OKAY? Nurse #2: MELVA, WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU ON A STRETCHER AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU - TO THE O.R., ALL RIGHT? - Nurse #1: IT'S TIME, OKAY? ( Michel Odent speaking ) OH, THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO-- TAKE FLATBUSH. Cara: I WENT TO NURSING SCHOOL AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND THEN BECAME AN OBSTETRICAL NURSE IN THE LABOR ROOM WHERE I PRACTICED FOR FIVE YEARS. AFTER THAT I WENT TO MIDWIFERY SCHOOL AND THEN PRACTICE FOR A YEAR IN A HOSPITAL, FOUR YEARS OUT IN AN OUT-OF-HOSPITAL BIRTHING CENTER. AND THEN I BEGAN MY OWN SOLO HOME-BIRTH PRACTICE, WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS. I LIKE TO SEE THEM IN THEIR HOMES. THE RATIONALE FOR THAT IS, FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE BABY IN THEIR HOMES; SECONDLY, I'D RATHER BE ON THEIR TURF THAN THEM BE ON MY TURF. I'D RATHER THEM BUILD A COMFORTABLE AMBIANCE THAT I GET TO SEE THEM IN ON A REGULAR BASIS, SO THAT BY THE TIME IT'S TIME FOR THE BIRTH I KNOW WHERE THEIR ROOMS ARE-- THEIR BATHROOMS. AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF GIVING THE POWER BACK TO THE WOMAN. BREATHE IN DEEP THROUGH YOUR MOUTH. THAT SOUNDS REALLY CLEAR. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. ONE COLANDER IS GOOD. I CAN USE THAT TO PUT MY INSTRUMENTS IN-- THE GLOVES AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. AND THEN THE PLACENTA-- I HAVE A LARGE FREEZER BAG. IS THAT OKAY? YEAH, I CAN DO TWO GALLON-SIZE ZIPLOC BAGS. IT'S BETTER FOR NEW YORK CITY FREEZERS 'CAUSE YOU CAN PUT SOME MASKING TAPE ON, WRITE "PLACENTA." YOU CAN DO IT. YOU WANNA GO FIRST OR YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU FIRST AND THEN YOU TAKE A TURN? - Girl: YOU GO FIRST. - OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? PRETTY BIG? - ( La Juana laughing ) - THINK IT'S READY TO COME OUT? - I THINK SO. DEFINITELY. - YEAH. Cara: I DO BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHO CHOOSE HOME BIRTH, THEY DO SHARE SOMETHING. IT COULD BE JUST A FEELING THAT SHE KNOWS HOW SHE WANTS TO DO THINGS. AND THEN I THINK WHEN SHE'S IN LABOR, SHE CAN INTERACT WITH HER LABOR IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN IF EVERYBODY IS DOING THINGS TO HER AND MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HER. BABY. Cara: COME OUT, BABY, BABY GIRL. - Gregor: IT'S WARM. - Cara: YEAH, I CHECKED. IT IS WARM. ( moaning ) THAT'S REALLY CLOSE. THAT'S GREAT. ( moaning ) ( Odent speaking ) - PUSH IT, COME ON. - Boy: HEY, MAMA. - MAMA. - NO NO NO NO NO. YEAH. IT'S COMING. THERE SHE IS. Boy: BABY. - BABY. - LET SOMEBODY ELSE LOOK AT THE TIME 'CAUSE I DON'T-- OKAY, LET ME SEE. - BABY. - MAKE SURE SHE'S OUT OF THE WATER. - LET ME JUST SEE HER FACE. - ( boy laughing ) OKAY, GOOD. I GOT IT. ( boy laughing ) BABY. ( Cara chuckles ) YOU'RE DONE. SHE'S FINE. IT'S OKAY. DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO. I'M JUST GONNA KEEP AN EYE ON HER-- PART OF MY JOB. - La Juana: HI, HONEY. - Boy: HI. HI. BE CAREFUL. - THE CORD'S A LITTLE SHORT. - YEAH. Mayra: I WENT ONLINE AND I FOUND THAT NEW YORK HOSPITALS HAD SOME OF THE HIGHEST CESAREAN RATES IN THE NATION. THAT ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED ME. I GUESS I EXPECTED NEW YORK WOMEN TO BE MORE LIKE, "HEY, I'M TAKING CHARGE." SO I WAS SURPRISED AND I WAS SCARED. I MEAN, I KNEW WHAT INTERVENTIONS I WAS OKAY WITH AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ZERO. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS CAN GO WRONG DURING PREGNANCY, JUST LIKE WITH ANYTHING ELSE, BUT I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE PRECIPITATED, SO TO SPEAK. I SAID, "DAVID, THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD." AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO INTERVIEW MIDWIVES IN THE CITY. I JUST FEEL LIKE I TRUST MY BODY. - Cara: THAT'S GREAT. - AND I REALLY JUST KIND OF WANT TO-- AND I MEAN, I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS IS KIND OF THE WAY YOU RUN THINGS ANYWAY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET MY BODY DO WHAT IT'S GONNA DO AND THEN-- - WELL, IT SO DOES. - OKAY. AND THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T EVEN RUN THINGS. YOUR BODY RUNS THINGS AND IT'S RESPECTING THAT. AND THEN I'M LIKE THE GUARDIAN OF SAFETY AND THE WITNESS OF YOUR PROCESS. I REALLY DO FIRMLY BELIEVE OFTENTIMES THAT THE BODY IS SMARTER THAN ME. AND I'M NOT THAT DUMB. I SPOKE HER YESTERDAY. SHE DID NOT ATTEND - THIS APPOINTMENT TODAY. - BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH HER HERE? - YES. - OKAY, I'LL CALL HER. REMEMBER, THAT TONGUE RING-- LET ME SEE-- - HAS TO COME OUT. - --HAS TO COME OUT BEFORE DELIVERY. YOU DIDN'T PUSH THAT LONG TO HAVE THIS 9-LB BABY. I MEAN, YOU DID A FABULOUS JOB. I WAS SO IMPRESSED. A LOT OF WOMEN WALK IN WITH THE IDEAS THAT-- "I DEFINITELY WANT AN EPIDURAL" OR "I DON'T WANT ANYTHING" OR "MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SEDATION." AND IT'S OKAY. SHE HAS OPTIONS. I KNOW YOU WANT TO KIND OF GO NATURAL AND DO EVERYTHING NORMAL. THAT'S FINE. WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME, OKAY? THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO-- ONE CONTRACTION AT A TIME. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THIS BABY WILL BE OUT, YOU'LL BE BREASTFEEDING AND LAUGHING UP A STORM, OKAY? OH YEAH, THEY ALL COME OUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I HAVE THREE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS AND UNFORTUNATELY, I WASN'T ABLE TO HAVE A MIDWIFE. I WAS HIGH-RISK. SO I HAD AN M.D. AND HE WASN'T WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME. HE CAME IN TO DO THE DELIVERY AND HE WOULD LEAVE. AND I KNEW THEN THAT THERE'S GOTTA BE A DIFFERENT WAY. A
