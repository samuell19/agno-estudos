* * Let me begin by just saying this whole thing is incredibly out of character. One, two... God! But this is the last time I really felt alive. * * * * * * I honestly don't know how to tell you this story. Maybe I should just tell you about Lina. No, no, no, I... That one still hurts. * * * * * Hey, if we have kids, you think they're going to go through acne, end up with, like, scars all over their faces? I can't even believe you would ask me that. I mean... Well, don't take it personally. - It's just acne. It's not a big deal. - How can I not take it personally? That's my face. What am I going to do? I can't hide my face. You know that they can-- They can fix that now. It might be good for you. You could be really hot with smooth skin. You just don't even know it. * * I wish I could take you with me. * * * * From the first second we met, I felt something I've never felt before. You better propose to her. - But... - I have feelings for Ciara. - Oh, God. I love you. But I love Ciara too. - You don't even know her. Hello? Sam? Heya. No, I'm fine. What? That's fantastic! You would be perfect for this. Berlin? Look, it's fine. I'll book a ticket tonight. Okay. I'll be there in the morning. We'll go over the game plan. * You gotta go in the room, you gotta own it. You gotta run with it, you gotta convince these people. This is your movie. Do you still want to do this? God, yes, I'm not saying I don't want to do this. It's been years, Sam. I mean, it's been years! I'm going to Berlin. I'm taking this this meeting right? At my own expense. Will you stop bitching? - Travelocity! Travelocity! LA-Berlin. - You worry too much! - Stop worrying! - I'm broke. If this falls through I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hey, Isabel, can you get me a handkerchief? I got to dry my eyes. Is this about that girl? The girl? I don't know why I share anything with you. No, of course not! - Tell me the truth. - It's about being broke. Broke, broke, zero! That's-- It scares me. If this actor fucks me over again, you know? Listen to me. You're going to go to Berlin, gonna hang out with your buddies, gonna have a few drinks, you might even get some pussy. You know, German girls are probably dumb enough to fuck you. You're gonna have a good time then, you're going to crush the meeting. In 48 hours, your life is going to be completely different. * * It felt strange to be so far away from the drama of Hollywood and back in Berlin. Last time I was here it was so different for me. You crazy American beatnik mad man. We don't want your kind around here anymore. How many times do I have to tell you? Get out of here! Nein, Nein, Nein! Can you please, man? I've been on the plane all day. I'm so wiped out. Oh, say can you see... It's not funny, dude. I'm exhausted! Go away, you're too American. Dude, I've been flying all day, man. - Let's see you at the buzzer. - Thank you. - Go to the buzzer. - Jesus. Fuck! You did it too fast. Yeah, I didn't go to the door. I just let you go there for sort of comedy, really. I'm checking into an Airbnb place, man. I'm done. I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hey, man, how are you? - Oh, God! - Good to see you. - Welcome to Berlin, man. Good to see you. - You look really bad! - Oh. - Hey, welcome to Berlin. - Hey, good to see you. Thank you so much. So, the big news is... - What's up? - Yeah, well, um... Should I say or you'll say it? I'll say. Rike and I have been thinking about having a threesome. Or a foursome or something. Haven't we? Stop talking about it. I thought you were going to say you wanted to have a kid. No, no. I can talk about it. Come on, I'm only going to talk about it when you're gone. I don't think you should do it. Actually, you're right. Why are we talking to him? 'Cause his love life is a disaster. He doesn't know anything. Wait. Now I'm interested in what he has to say. I just think if... You know, when people do that they're just... They're going to break up. That's a stupid thing to say. If people that drink coffee break up. Yeah, isn't it better than people cheating behind each other's back? - Exactly! - Which is what most couples do. Yes, this is it. Are you going to see that Lina girl? Is that why you're here? 'Cause, I see her around still, you know? - She's still around? - Oh, yeah. - No, it's been just too... - Messed up? It was too much, too much of an ending. - I'm just here for the meeting. - Fair enough. Sounds good. What happened? Don't bully him, now. Come on. No, it's fine. Four years ago, I came to Berlin on a little vacation. And that's when I met Lina. Fell madly in love with her. Instantly. God, she was this Norwegian dancer. Smart and funny. She was like physical and present in this way that just gets lost in film making. I mean, I was completely head over heels. So, we ended up hopping on this train, down to the Balkans. Spontaneously. I mean, we barely knew each other and all of a sudden we were just inseparable. So, what was supposed to be a couple of days turned into six weeks. But then, we make it down to Montenegro. And it's magic. At least it was for me. I mean, clearly, this was one sided. 'Cause all of a sudden, without a word, she just left. Wrote a note that said, "Let's end on a high note." And she has no idea how much that shook me. You've never seen her again? No, I called, I emailed her and... I don't know, mystery. Oh, tea, tea, bollocks, sorry. Are you guys really going to do some kind of foursome thing? Maybe. If the vibe was right, I don't know. - You need to sleep. - Mm-hmm. I love all these cafes and they're on both sides of the canal. There are so many, it blows my mind. Like, how can every one of these stay in business? Well, they can't. Oh, man. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, man. - Wow, that's a little below the belt. Boy, a lot of people must lose their shirt around here. Yeah, really easy to go bankrupt. I heard. Oh, God. How is your German by the way? - Non-existent. - What? Six years, man! - No, I decided I'm not going to learn it. - I thought you were going to take a class! Oh, no, no, no, no. Just remind me never to bring Friederike here. How could you not love them? Are you heartless? Oh, I do love you very, very much. But, unfortunately, I can't just commit to staying put for twenty years to take care of what is effectively just a small, moving pillow. So, until they invent one of you that lasts for six months, there's not much I can do. You just live too long, love. Sorry. I told Stephen I needed to be alone, go to a cafe to work on my notes for the next day's meeting. But I found myself heading to that little theater where she always went on Friday nights. I convinced myself that I just wanted to see a movie. She probably wouldn't even be there. And if she was... Who cares? No big deal to me. * * * - Hi. - Hi. It's nice seeing you. - It's been a while. - Yeah. Um, if you want me to go, I'll just bug off but I would love to buy a drink. Well, you may as well buy me a drink before you bug off since we... We know you're good at bugging off. Wow, so, we're there already. I mean, it's the big elephant in the room. At least, emotionally, for one of us. Isn't that the whole point not talk about the elephant? True. Except when the elephants are really emotionally scarring and bruising. And the person just dumps you on the beach, yeah. Then they just come up. Well, that might be true. Um, cheers and welcome back to Berlin. - Thank you. Prost. - Prost. I didn't expect to see you. So, what is going on with you? I thought you'd be in Paris and have your own dance studio. Well, I've been here and working a lot of different projects but, um... Now I got accepted for this dance program in Budapest, at the university and I leave in a couple of days. So, this is my last couple of days here in Berlin now. So... Days in Berlin. Right. Well, cheers to. That's wonderful. - So, funny that you're here. - Mm-hmm. I'm really happy for you. Do you have plans for later or? Well, I'm supposed to meet somebody here in, like, 30 minutes so maybe... Sorry, I already made plans with her. But let's definitely keep in touch on email this time. Yeah, sure. * * I figured it was all for the better. I was in Berlin for the meeting. I couldn't afford to lose. This was about business. And of all people I knew, I couldn't trust her. So, where's your girl? Really? Yeah. I'm going that way. Going to meet up later, actually. What are you doing here in Berlin? Work. It's three days, I'll go back. Cool. Hey, I didn't want it to go like this. Me either. * * * * * * - Super Collider. Wow! - Yes! That's the movie. But it's gonna happen this time. - Really? - Yes. It's crazy. It's like deja vu. It's like last time we met, you were just about to have a film made. And we met at Mind Pirates. Mm-hmm. Yeah, my life is stagnated. Thank you very much for reminding me. No, no, no, no. I'm just... I'm really impressed. It sounds like it. Let me tell you. No, I'm... I am happy for you. It's just a shame you had to give up that great romantic film. Yeah, yeah. That movie will never be made now. Romance is dead. - Hmm. - But the new one's going to be cool too. I'm sure. If you believe in it, it's going to be great. Yeah, yeah. It's funny to even hear that kind of idealism anymore. I mean, no offense, but in the real world, we make compromises. Hey, listen. My friend is probably waiting at this point so... I should get back and really hang out with her. Okay. You know I've got this goodbye party tomorrow night. It'd be really nice if you could come. Oh. Cool. Yeah, maybe. I have something I have to do tomorrow. But maybe I can at least stop by. Yeah, well, I know you're busy but, um... If you can come, it will be really nice. I'd be happy. All right. Thank you. - Well... - Take care. Yeah. - Have a good night. - Good luck! Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. * * * * * It's pretty high. Yikes! Woo. Why... Why... Tell me, why is this fun? I don't understand why this is fun. You know, when you jump that cliff, you will have fun. I am so not jumping this cliff. I am going to crawl, slowly but surely, back to the bar on the beach. Let's go. You know, sometimes you have to get out of your comfort zone, - even if it's scary, to have fun. - Oh, my God. Careful, careful. I promise you'll have fun Okay, okay, let's go back. 'Cause you're so idealistic and beautiful. Oh, my God! Aah! You know, there's a reason you have a comfort zone! Because it's comfortable! What's wrong with comfort? One, two... Good lord! * * Hey, I found this ad that might be interesting for us for this week. - Wow. - What do you think? Um... Yeah, I mean... It'll be... It'll be pretty mad. I've been working a lot. I think we should go. There's going to be, uh, a lot of fat, old guys dribbling on you. I know, but I've got you, you know? - Right. - I'm used to it. Yeah. I also found something interesting to wear in the store and... - Oh, yeah? What? - I think you'd be excited about it. You already found your... What... What... What did you get to wear? I don't know. Something sexy that you're gonna like. Can... Can... Can I see it? It's a surprise. You better find something for yourself. At Kit-Kat Club, in two days, their theories would be put to the test. And as much as Stephen pretended to be confident and joke with me, I could tell he was scared to death. And I didn't blame him. Friederike really seems determined. Of course, Stephen's nerves made my own even worse. I was trying to distract myself from the day's meeting with him. But all I could think about was Lina and what she said the night before. She knew exactly what to say to send me into a tailspin. * * By the time I was walking into this meeting, with ten years of work hanging in the balance, I was on my second bottle of vodka. And I had absolutely no idea what I was going to say. Jason, - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Super Collider. - Super Collider. Here we go. Uh... I ... Are you... Are you feeling all right? I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just... Here's the thing. I'm so sorry for this. I feel like I'm ruining this before it's begun. Okay? No, I know what's going on in your mind. You think I'm crazy and, oh, he's an alcoholic. And I'm not an alcoholic. I... There's nothing wrong with being an alcoholic. I mean, it's just that that's not my problem. It's... I... The reality is, I've never drunk before a meeting. I... But I saw this girl last night, okay? And it's someone I had a thing with a few years ago. And it was really intense and I really fell for her. It ended badly and I haven't seen her since. And then last night, I come to Berlin to have this meeting and I run into her. Of all people, like, the person that can shake my confidence, okay? And, you know, it's one thing to be rejected, like, "Oh, I don't want your genes in my gene pool. So, goodbye." But... It's like seeing her reminded me of who I was at that exact moment. You know, like, I was still full of all that idealism, you know, making these small little films. And then, "I'm going to make one in Hollywood," and I had this passion project - that I really, genuinely believed in, right? - Mm-hmm. And then, it fell apart. So, when I see her again, it's like, "Whatever happened with that film?" "Oh, no, I'm making something new." "Oh, a sci-fi film. Oh, really?" "Yeah, Super Collider." "Oh, really?" You're getting that kind of vibe from her, you know? And you're just feeling like, "You don't know what it's like. You don't know..." Like, I gave that up, so no more indie bullshit. Then I get here and now all I'm thinking is, "Oh, my God. She's right. She's right. I'm the guy who is taking meetings that are for this ridiculous concept?" You know what I mean? Like, my heart isn't in it. But I'm thinking I need the pay check. And I do! I need the pay check more than anyone and... And that's what I'm thinking. I'm like, is that... Is what she was judging me... is she right? She's right! Oh, well... First of all, that's the worst sales pitch I have ever heard. Um... I like the script. I loved your last film, um... Usually, in these types of meetings, people come in, they're super confident. They want to instill confidence in the other person, so, they overdo it. Everyone's... I'm bullshitting them, they're bullshitting me and... I actually, really appreciate you being honest. I actually find this kind of comforting and refreshing. And I think it'll make you work harder and make the kind of movie that you want to make and that's the movie that I would like to do. And as long as we're not bullshitting each other, I'm not wandering around Berlin seeing the sights. My girlfriend thought I was... Doesn't matter. My girlfriend doesn't want me to come home. But I like your honesty. I think it will make us both work really hard. I'm in. Yes? Yes, yes. In other words, yes! - You want to do this movie? - I want to do this movie. I'm taking your word that you're not a real alcoholic. I believe you. What? And I want you to go back to that girl and say, "Oh, it turns out I made a really awesome movie in Los Angeles." So, let's do that. This is crazy! I would have never had the nerve to show up at Lina's going away party had I failed. But, given that it was all set now, I had no hesitation. Besides, had I not seen her, none of this would have ever happened. Care for another shot? Of course. Oh, I'm going to miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Of course, I only knew half the story. Otherwise, it might have all ended very differently. I'm so glad you could make it! It's perfect. Congratulations. And for you too. Mmm. And how did it go last night with that girl? Oh, you wanna know the truth? If you had sex with her, no, no, no. Okay, the truth, get read, it's hot. - Yeah? - I went home, and I played Bejeweled on my phone. And I spent so many hours, unable to sleep... ...that I beat my high score. That felt pretty good. Wow, you like to brag. Oh, it was... Ooh! - You did not just throw a tomato on my face. - No. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You didn't? - No. - I didn't think so because... That seems like it would be really wrong to do that. I would never do that. - It's wrong. - It's wrong. - I would never do that. - And people are starving, so... It's just a matter of time. Oh, shit. This is not high school. I never went to high school. Okay, truce, truce, truce. Okay? No, no, no. * * * I love this big room It's gorgeous. Yes, it's nice now. Got rid of everything. Only few boxes left. Congrats on this purchase, by the way. Thank you, it took a long time to get that one. You have no idea how much I want to listen to this. Father Abraham and the German Smurfs. Hmm. Are you still mad at me? I mean... I think what happened in Montenegro, the way you left and then didn't take a call or email, that was just kind of immature. Well, how mature have you been during your break ups? I just didn't know we were breaking up. So, how is your love life now? I like my independence. Still do, huh? Yeah, how's your love life? My love life now is finally a bit more independent. Totally independent now. I got involved, really involved with someone that was really wrong. Hm. * * * I'm gonna be responsible and go. Okay. - Have a good travel. - You too. Okay. Okay. - It's late. - Okay, I should go. Okay. Okay, well, Sunday nights, let's Skype. We'll Skype. - Bye. - Bye. Are you serious? You don't have a condom with you? Yes, I was not expecting to get laid tonight, okay? Well, you're not laid yet. Mmm. I'll be right back. Now, as fate would have it, it was apparently some religious holiday. So, all of the stores are closing early. I mean, places that are normally open 24 hours a day, are shutting their doors as I'm running up to them. It was a nightmare! Fuck religion! And then I started to wonder if God was trying to prevent me from returning to Lina. I'm a horny atheist, running through Berlin, debating whether some God could potentially be intervening in my sex life. Fucking nuts! Do either of you have a condom by any chance? - Sorry. - Okay, thanks. I had never wanted to learn German so badly. Sprechen Sie Englisch? What's the word? Condom, condom! I thought it was the same in German. Condom? Condom, condom? Sex, uh... When you have sex, you put on a piece of plastic, plastique? Penis, plastique? If you don't want herpes. No herpes, then you get a con-- Self respect was out the window. They just pretended like they didn't understand. To screw with me. And then it occurred to me, this might be the perfect way to get revenge for the way she left me in Montenegro. She's in a room, naked, expecting me to return, willing to have sex, and I just never show up. * Oh, Jesus, why was I wasting time? Montenegro meant absolutely nothing to her. I had to accept it for what it was. I was older and more mature. I could have meaningless nights like this. - Do you by any chance have a condom? - Condom? Yes, of course. Oh, God, yes! - Here you go. - Thank you. And then finally, I got lucky. Literally. * * * * Thank you. This is exactly what I need right now. Perhaps, I can interest you in something slightly less boring. How slightly? That depends on your mood. You know what mood I've been in lately. Your mood begins with an "H." Maybe you should. My boyfriend is coming back. - When? - In five minutes. - You like that? Huh? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. You want to see me fucked? - Yeah. I'm gonna see you fuck someone, yeah. Yeah. I love you. I love you too. What do you think about maybe trying to have kids at some point? Are you kidding me? I thought you hated kids. I don't hate kids. It's just... I don't know. I'm not saying necessarily at this second but... For sure want to have them at some point. Yeah, yeah. I mean, for sure, at some point. Sure. I mean, we've been together for seven years, so... Yeah, and they've been amazing But the whole point was that we were free to do whatever we wanted and travel, you know? Yeah, but we didn't travel in over two years. Give me a break, all right? We will travel. Wherever you want, soon. We're just kind of a little bit caught up with the whole cafe thing back there for a while, yeah? What, just out of the blue, you want to have kids? I'm just feeling moody. Come here. Big decision. I think this one is better. What is it? Love is a drug that makes us come together so we can mate and reproduce. It actually even decreases your IQ, - so, we would do this. - Hmm. But, for thousands of years, we only lived until we were 30 years old. So, now, we've completely outlived our capacity to love. So, like, the idea of a lifelong love is just a complete fantasy. Isn't that what you want to hear in this setting, just when you're starting something with someone. It's just... It's so beautiful. Starting? We're 17 days in! Oh, Hey, Mr. Stay out all night in Berliner. - Oh, yeah. - You dirty dog. - Mm-hmm. - Huh? So, come on, I want to hear everything. Who was she? No secrets here. I want dirt. You know, it was a good night out, it was fun. They love your accent, I bet, though. That American accent. Oh, so sexy. "Oh, this is so sexy, the American accent, yah. Oh, you want to go to bed with me?" Did that happen? Hold on, hold on. Stay there, stay there, Let me just get this. Sleep. Sleep. Hello, mate, this is Siemens Mobile Australia. Now they were one day closer to going to the sex club. I could tell that Stephen was in full panic. I had no idea why he wouldn't just tell Rike he didn't want to go. But maybe it was because he used to be the dominant one in the relationship and things were starting to change. When they met, he was working as an architect and she was a student. Now she was a teacher, who'd started to have her own circle of friends and influences outside of his world. At the same time, Stephen was struggling. He had quit his career as an architect and tried to open this cafe. He put all of his money into this big architectural idea to have coffee cups go up the entire side of this building, five stories. In the process, he spent so much, he had to go bankrupt before ever serving a single cup. Since then, he's kicked around doing Skype customer service and selling silk screen t-shirts he's made. His best seller is the vagina, we are all made here. Maybe this whole thing would surprise me and bring them together. Or they would back out before it was too late. But, in the meantime, I went shopping for sex outfits with Stephen. And tried to pretend I wasn't counting the minutes until I could see Lina again before I left. - Would you do me in these? - Ooh. Uh... - Would you do me in these? - No. Not right, not right. - No? - No. - Keep looking. - Why not? I don't... That's not sexy. They're not sexy because nothing is sexy for a guy. What is sexy for a guy? I mean, she's just going to look like an absolute bombshell and I'm going to look like an absolute bellend. - Do sit ups, I don't know. - Do sit ups? That's your advice? Do sit ups and then what? Go naked? I don't think you should go at all. That's really gonna turn everybody on, innit? Ooh, I like this. Excuse me? - Who is that for? Uh, actually for Lina. Oh, yeah, the girl you're never gonna see again. Yes, but it's a good thing. I mean, it was brief, you know? I'm going back to LA for the film, she's going to Budapest. Just time enough to rush back for a bit more punishment and then... - Yeah, but, it's not punishment. - Ah, right. It's true. Maybe when I was young, I could, you know fall in love at the drop of a hat, but as you get older you just... - You don't feel as much. - You don't feel as much. Yeah, I'd love my heart to race, but it just can't. I've got something that will make your heart race. Would you fuck me in this? - That's the one, man. - Yeah? Yeah, definitely. That's... I would definitely... I would fuck me in that. Okay. Brilliant. Hi, guys. Hey! Oh, good to see you. Thank you for making it. You must be the one that leaves people on beaches? - Oh! - Oh. Someone's been talking. Whoops, don't listen to him! - Let's open this bottle of wine. - Now, that is cool! * Okay, I can only take you to one museum and then I have to go back and get my stuff in order. So, this is how you can tell that all the artists are men. How's that? You see the small penises? Hmm. I don't really... They all have small penises? - Yes. - All of them? Yeah. If you have a look, you can see that all the penises are smaller than the balls. They would do this to trick the woman to think that whatever she had was better than this at least. This will be... Yeah, this will be like her reference. Her penis guide. - Wow, that's great. That's what yours says? - Yeah. - Doesn't yours say that? - No. - Look at that guy now. It's tiny. - All right, I give you that. - I'll give you that one. - Tiny. - There is a female artist. - One. She's got a couple pieces. Big pieces. Hey, I got this dance performance tomorrow night. Would you like to come? I'd love to. It's my last night in town. It's actually your last night in town too. Yeah, don't remind me. I have too much to figure out. So, you heading back home now? Not just yet. There's just one more thing I really want to do. It's this East German amusement park. It's closed down now. Come on, before anyone sees us. They don't have security around here? Well, they got dogs. Dogs, are you kidding me? Nobody's getting in this. - Wow! - It's insane! My God! Look at that. * * * * Hey, so I've got a question for you. Yeah, what's that? Why did you leave me in Montenegro? Dumped me? Ditched the old Anderson? Really? Yeah, I mean, you know... When you left... Think of all the things that went through my mind, on that boat ride back. "Does she have some boyfriend that she wasn't going to tell me about? Is she secretly married or..." Man, I was crazy about you and I thought, "God, I can't believe how much I misread the situation." I just feel really bad for telling you like this, now. But, when we were traveling, I got pregnant. What? I was a dancer. I really couldn't be pregnant. When I found out I was so ashamed, so... I just left. God. I feel horrible. Why didn't you tell me? At least I could have helped. We could have talked about what you want to do... I probably should have told you. But... It wouldn't have made a difference. Like, I'd known you for three weeks. And you were about to have your film made in Los Angeles. And I'm a dancer. I was going back to Berlin. I had all these plans and dreams for me too. It's... None of us wanted kids. That's the reality. So, there was nothing to discuss. And if I told you, you would just felt bad and guilty and distracted, so... I just went and took care of it. Put it behind me. I thought I would never see you again. * * I was shocked. What I had been offended about years ago seemed so frivolous. I immediately felt bad for her. Having to make that decision, go through it all alone. At the same time, I was also hurt that she would make such a big decision without me. But she was so young and probably scared to death. Could I hold it against her? And I knew she was right. Probably wouldn't have changed anything. But could it have changed everything? * But, in the moment, you never really, fully know the story, in yourself or in the other person. Hey! Scheisse. Hi, love, I'm really sorry. What's going on? I thought you were making dinner. Yeah, I was. Anderson came over and, you know, he had a fight with that girl and I just needed to take him out and, uh... I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you tomorrow, love. I'm sorry. Okay, but you should have told me. I could have grabbed something. No, I just left without thinking. You know, I'm sorry. Okay, I'll talk to you later. * * I love Berlin. Ich bin ein Berliner. You know that means, "I'm a jelly doughnut," right? What? That's what Kennedy said. Yeah. What Kennedy wanted to say is, "Ich bin Berliner." "Ich bin ein Berliner" means "I'm a jelly doughnut." My God, it's like the most famous line from the American foreign policy speech and it's "I'm a jelly doughnut"? Did you not learn that in school? No, they very conveniently forgot to put that in our text books. - It's funny though. - Let me try your wine. Yeah. It's nice to share, you know, when you have the same taste with somebody and you share their food? It's like, oh! I'm getting a call. This is about the movie. I got to take this. Hello, Sam? * * * Anderson? Anderson. Hey. What's going on? The studio backed out. The movie is over. Oh, my God. Why? Why? You met the actor and it was on yesterday. - How can it-- - The actor backed out. He said he liked my honesty, but apparently it just scared him to death. It's crazy! Why can't you just get another actor? They've lost interest in the movie. It's been turned around. It's done. Wow. That's... Can't you get another studio? No, God, please, Jesus! It'll be ten years since I've made a film, Lina. In this business, that's it. You're done! I have $35,000 in credit card debt at this point that I poured into this freaking movie. It's gonna happen. One way or the other, I'm sure. It's like I bet on myself and I lost. That's the truth. You haven't lost. You think it's lost now, but you've got so much going for you. What do I have? Please-- - People will recognize it. - Please, tell me... Recognize what? Recognize what? Because you can try and try and try and then you can lose and then it's over! - And that's what happens. End of story. - That's what you... - End of story is, it didn't work out. - I don't think it is. Sorry, boy, that could have been something and it didn't work out. You have more than just this film. You can do another script and then you can do this film afterwards. With $35,000 of debt at 22 percent interest, what exactly am I going to do? I'm going to be living my life to pay off my credit card every month. I've been living this, believe me. Without health insurance, I was missing this tooth. For two years I was just walking around like a fucking homeless guy. For two years! It's like-- It's funny when it's not your life, okay? That's the goddamn truth. - I'm fucked-- - You're gonna make it. I'm sure it's gonna happen. What do you know about having to take shit? What do you know about people backing out and fucking you over and just leaving you? Nothing. You know nothing about that because it's just easy for you. You've got a university just taking care of all your shit. You've never had to eat shit, you've never had anybody just back out on you, ever! * * I felt like a complete asshole. She didn't believe in long term romance for anyone. So, it wasn't a matter of if but when. * * * Hello? Hey, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Where are you? - I'm in the U-Bahn, I'm taking a train. - Ugh... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean any of this. I'm just so frustrated, I can't even tell you. - It's fine. Let's just say goodbye, now. I have a lot of things to figure out. Please, I can't stand to lose you like this, tonight. It was completely unfair to take out on you. I'm just... There's no excuse for that. I'm sorry. I know you're gone tomorrow and... I mean, this would just stay with me forever, from just, this is how things ended between us. I mean... At least have one last kebab with me. You can even throw the kebab at me. It's perfectly okay. Assuming I have enough change to buy a kebab. Okay. My art residency got canceled. What? What do you mean? What happened? I got a letter in the mail, totally out of the blue. And all funding is gone! What? I mean, you were supposed to start in like... Two days from now, three days? I know! I called to find out what happened. They told me because of the austerity cuts. That was it. How frustrating! I've given up my job, my place, I used all my fucking money to get into this residency. Is this a joke? As you know, like, Olivia threw this huge goodbye party for me. And you just decided to go through your party, anyways? Yeah, I just... God, I didn't have the energy to go through it. Like, tell everyone how it fell through. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to laugh, but it's horribly sad. It's embarrassing. That's what it is. Like, it seems like everyone has interesting things going on in their life. And you were going off to make your big film. I felt like a complete loser. And when you first start lying you just kind of have to go on with it. I probably just have to go back and beg for my job at the cupcake place. My manager will love rubbing it in my face. I can't do that. - Are you going back to Norway? What is your plan now? No, no, I don't have any idea. I think... I think we really found each other. - Think we really did. - Oh, boy! Wow, what a disaster. You know what you're gonna do? Well, I'm gonna finish this pita. Mm-hmm. And then I'm gonna start my plan. My life plan right now. Well, no, then I'll probably start panicking about how I'm going to pay off my debt. But you've got some money in the bank, don't you? Yeah, a little, a little bit, but that won't last long. And those credit cards, those are American right? Yeah, they're American. Well... We're not in America. This is true. You're a little devil. - I'm just saying. - A very sexy devil. We should go to a club, dance all night and just forget about everything else. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Let's take a train back to Montenegro. Yeah, that would be fun. No, I'm serious. I mean... - Really? - We could do it. We could do it pretty cheaply. I mean, ride share and hostels and, you know. I mean, why the hell not? We don't have... We've got no places and no jobs tying us down, I mean... You are serious. Yeah. I'm, I'm in. Oh, my God. Okay. All right, we'll be on one of these trains tomorrow. This is crazy. Morning. Sorry. Sorry, I was trying to be quiet, didn't wanna wake you up. Good job. I'm headed to work. Okay, I think I'm headed to sleep. You must have had a lot of fun, last night. Oh, I drank too much. Feels... I feel really shit. Oh, I'm so sorry for you. I'd really appreciate it if you'd cleaned up after yourself. Oh. You don't take responsibility for anything in your life and I'm sick of you wallowing in your failures! - Oh, come on! - Get over it! Wait, I didn't wash the dishes for one fucking night! Come on! Don't bring up the whole Five Stories thing, Jesus! Oh, fine, let's clean! Let's clean the house! I'm leaving. I have to go to work. I paid my way up. I paid the rent for years, you know it. Now just... Let me get back on my feet! Ah, fuck. * * * * * * * * * - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Now I'm gonna take very good care of you. For all your... Are you listening? Thank you. For all your life and I might even love you a little bit. My name is Stephen. What is your name? You don't have a name and you can't speak. Well, that's all right. Friederike will give you a name. She's brilliant. You're gonna love her. And I've been being a bit of a prick lately. So, you're gonna have to make it up to her from me. We'll do it together. For... Uh, don't do that. Not on there. For a long time. Do you do anything else? Just run around. Wax on. Hi-yah! Oh, God. Have you seen The Karate Kid, the original? No. - It's how you learn how to kick ass, by painting walls. - Like this? And then you stand like this and then you kick them in the face. That's it. - Do you think we're gonna get this all done? - Don't worry. Yes. Go to your rehearsal. I am gonna go to the Turkish market. So when you come back from rehearsal, we're gonna sit right here, have a nice meal. You're gonna go to your show, which I cannot wait to see. I've been dying to see this. And then tonight we'll get some Club-Mate and vodka and just have an all night paint party. We'll walk to the train in the morning. - We'll sleep on the train? - We'll sleep on the train. Thank you. * Hey, Sam. What's going on? So check it out. Amy Adams read your script last night. She likes it. She wants to meet you. Wow. She going on publicity tour right now in London. She wants to meet you for dinner tonight. My office is booking the flight right now and you gotta go to the airport right away. Wow. Uh... I mean, that's... It's great, it's great news. I don't know what to say. I mean, I can't really just run off right this second. Is it... It is a fucking miracle that Amy Adams read this script and wants to do it. I appreciate it. I appreciate you getting her to read this. Fantastic! It's just that, like... I'm with my friend. I really care about this girl. I'm going to her performance. I mean, I don't understand why I have to run out the door right this second. I mean... Wait. Is that the same girl as before? Last time I remembered she dumped you on a beach. You know how these things go. She's a big star. She wants to meet you now. We have to seize the moment. I feel like I've heard this a million times before. I mean, I don't want a wild goose chase. We've a lot riding on this. Do you know how hard it is to get her to read a script? Do you know how many directors would give their left arm to have a meeting with her on a movie? This is our shot! She'd be perfect. She would be perfect. Get on the fucking plane! This is what we do. Get in the cab, get to London, go get the actress, get back to Berlin and go get your girl. It's fine. You're losing time. We don't have a choice. Let's face it, if this falls through, you're done, it's over. No one will even bother taking a meeting with you. Eight years since you worked. Your career will be done. * * * * * I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. This is so nice. Thank you. It's the least I could do. What I said wasn't fair. I know it's been a hard time for you. No, I was being a prick. Now come and sit down. I've spoken to the chef and he'd like to come and introduce the dishes to you himself, personally. Hi, salut. It's been a pleasure to cook for you this evening. Let's start with a little stuffed something, uh, followed by, uh, this, uh, thing here, which we have made and also one of these which you would like very much, and you eat all of it. - Honey, you didn't have to do all that. - Yeah, I did. One more very, very important present. * * Oh, my God! Thank you. * * - Hello. Anderson? - Lina! This is Anderson's agent. Sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but, uh... He gave me this number for emergencies. Why are you calling me? Well, I just wanted to see... Do you know if Anderson got on that plane today for London? What? I don't know. I've been away from my phone for a couple of hours, but as far as I know he is in my apartment, cooking. Cooking, cooking. Um, can you help me find him? I need you to get him on that plane. I'll tell him, but I'm sure he can make his own decisions. Listen, Lina, I mean, uh... We don't know each other really well and... I don't what to say it's your fault. Okay? But let's just be honest here. It didn't work out last time with Anderson. You're together now, you're having fun. But all good things are gonna come to an end. What do I have to do with any of this? You know, it's not a coincidence that the two times this has happened, he's been with you. Now look, I'm sure you guys are having a great time, but Anderson has dedicated seven years of his life to this. And you may be running around, you're in love, et cetera. But he's gonna wake up one day and he's gonna realize he doesn't have a career anymore, and he's gonna point the finger at somebody. He's gonna point the finger at me and he's gonna point the finger at you. So why don't you think about that and help me get him on this plane. * * * Ta, ta, ta, ta What do you think? You like it? It's... I love it. - It's, um... - I bought it for tonight. You... Good. Wow. So, what do you... You want to go to that thing? Yes. Don't you? There's... There's something I wanna talk to you about. Oh, if this is something serious, please, let's talk about it tomorrow. Just that I really really want everything to be open and honest between us, you know and... Oh, come on, we're over the fight. I love you and you love me, don't you? Yeah, more than anything. So then? So then let's go out and have some fun and kiss and make out. Just enjoy the night. And it's like you said. The reason for not having all these attachment was that we wanted to be free and do whatever we want. Uh, yeah, but we do have an attachment now, the little fluffy, white, moving pillow thing down there, who doesn't even have a name, I might add. Um, I think, Charlie? Charlie. Charlie can take care of himself for a few hours. Besides, you were out all night yesterday. It's only fair that I get some fun tonight. And where else am I gonna wear this costume? I'm going to put it on. * * * Like Stephen and Friederike, I wanted it all and knew I was risking having nothing. But I couldn't stop myself. So, there I was, in London, waiting for Amy Adams, when reality finally hit me. Who was I kidding? This was just like ten years, the meetings before, destined to be a wild goose chase. She couldn't have liked Super Collider. This thing is a piece of shit. I mean, she probably hadn't even read it honestly. She was just meeting with me as some favor. And I knew how this would end. While the woman I was falling madly in love with back in Berlin was doing what it was that inspired her. Like I used to make low-budget independent films, before moving to Hollywood and taking meetings that go nowhere. And for the first time, I started to analyze my own life, like I would a story. And I asked myself, if I were writing this as a scene for a character, and not for me in real life, what would I have him do? In screenwriting, there's this things called the "MacGuffin." It's the thing about which a character is so obsessed, he'll do anything to have it. But usually, it distracts you from what the story is really, ultimately about. And I finally had to ask myself, "What do you want?" I wanted her. It all became so clear. This film was my MacGuffin, Super Collider. I needed to walk away. Forget Hollywood, if it's gonna drop me, am I ever gonna get this made, forget it all. I needed to have faith in myself again like I did when I started from absolutely nothing. But I just sat there, paralyzed. In a script, there are no consequences, it's all just fantasy. So, it's easy. I knew that If I got up, that was it. Ten years of work, gone. All of my ideas, who I was, wrapped up in it. I knew if I stayed much longer, I was gonna miss that flight. It was a decision, not about a story I was hoping to sell, but about the story of my own miserable, cowardly life. When crazy, romantic ideas pop up in your life, like hopping on a train together to Montenegro, you jump at them or they just disappear. Taxi! My agent kept calling and I just ignored it. And for the first time, since standing on the cliffs in Montenegro three years before, I felt alive. * Sometimes you just have to get lost in the wilderness to find what it is you really want. * * * Can I have a vodka cranberry and Whiskey Sour, please? - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - Good. And you? - Good. - I love your... What is it, a corset? Yeah, corset. - Yeah, it's hot. - It's amazing. It's very tight, I can breathe barely, but... - Yeah? - I like it. Thank you. This is my boyfriend, Stephen. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Patrick. - Nice to meet you. - This is my wife, Katherine. Hi. Hey. We were just talking about how hot you two look. Oh. Well, Rike looks amazing but, um, I look like an idiot. You look hot. I love your lederhosen. That's really not... Thanks. - Cheers. - Oh, cheers. Cheers. * * You guys, uh... Do you guys wanna dance a bit? Uh... Sure. Why not? * * * * * * * * * * * * Rike. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's the matter? Did he do something? No, he was fine. I think I freaked out because I saw you with this girl. I don't even like that girl. You're my girl. I think I wasn't prepared. You wanna go? Me too. Let's go home. It'd be nice. You can do me a private show. - I will. - Yeah. Besides, we've got responsibilities, that cat's gonna be worried. I'll get my coat. You wait here. Okay. * * * * What are you doing here? Well, I thought about it and I think we should maybe have another drink. It's cold outside and it's a long walk home. What... Hang on, hang on. Are you sure this isn't just some reaction to the, 'cause... I'd... I'm happy to go home. No, no, no. I had fun, I just freaked out for a second. Let's go inside. One more drink. * * * * * * * ...the sky right now. Just look at those snowy scenes on the ground there at Heathrow. Piles of snow accumulating and it just keeps coming. Terminal 7 is closed and now in the last hour or so Heathrow has closed completely. The authorities are saying... ...it will be shut until least 3:00... Hello. Lina. Hey. Hi. I'm so sorry about last night and... I had to go to London and I could not get out of it and I just, I feel horrible. I've called you a million times, but... I'm actually snowed in right now. I'm not gonna leave till 3:00, which means I'm not make our train to Montenegro. It's fine, like it really doesn't matter. No, it's not fine. I already looked it up online and I can take a plane directly from London to Dubrovnik - at 4:00 p.m. - Anderson... - So if you just get on the train... - I got a really good news. They got funding back for my residency in Budapest. So... Some kind of emergency loan. I still got my plane ticket, so I'm going right now, actually. Oh. That's... great. I couldn't be happier for you. How did your meeting go with Amy Adams? Yeah. Yeah, my meeting went great. Yeah. Couldn't have gone better, so... The movie's back on. That's perfect. Can't wait to see it. Yeah, I can hardly believe it. Yeah, I guess Montenegro wasn't meant to happen for us. Back to plan A. Yeah. Back to our plan A. Yeah. I gotta go. I gotta get my plane. I guess just keep in touch, call me when you get there. Yeah. Let's do that. - Bye, Anderson. - Bye. * * * * * * * * * * - Rike. - Mmm. Rike. Wake up. - Come on, let's go. - Okay. I don't think we should do that again. No. I won't ever do that again. Can we, can we sit for a minute? Uh, grab a coffee or something like that... Stephen, let's get home. It's cold and I'm freezing. I know, I know. I just really... Can I just... I want to just talk to you for a second. I want one, one second to talk to you properly. I just want you to know that, um, I'm really excited about us and about our future, and... - Stephen-- - Hang on. And... I want you to know that I don't need anything, or want anything apart from you. - Stephen, stop-- - Just hang on because-- My family doesn't express feelings and you're my family and we do express feelings and I want to, so just let me. I want to be the best boyfriend that I can for you and, if it's something you would like, the best husband as well. - Wait-- - Thinking about everything that we talked about and... I don't want anything more in this world than to have children with you and be the best dad that I can. Stephen, I don't know. You don't know what? I don't know if I want this anymore. Because of last night? 'Cause that was... We'll just forget about it. That was... It's not because of last night. I think I don't love you anymore. I'm so sorry. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - Hey, man. - This is for your cafe? Yeah, just, um... Just started to look at it all again. Are you needing anything from the store? I'm gonna go. Yeah, can you get some, um, cat food? Cheers, man. Anderson? - Oh, hey, Olivia. - What are you doing here? - Oh, well... - I thought you were in Montenegro with Lina. Well, yeah, it's been a change of plans. Um, her residency, the funding came through again, so... - What? - Yeah, so she went to Hungary instead. No, she's... She's in Montenegro. Yeah, no, we were about to leave because her funding fell through, but then she... It came back. - They worked it out. - But she emailed me yesterday. She's in Montenegro. She sent me a picture. From Montenegro? Yeah, and I thought you were there, too. She sent you a picture yesterday, from Montenegro? - Yes. Yes. - Yesterday? On the beach. Yeah. What are you doing here? Get up! Gotta go to the airport. What? Why? Move, asshole! Move, asshole! Asshole! Oh, God! * - You've got everything? - I got it all, man. Hey, listen. Don't fuck it up like I did, yeah? Okay? And shave on the plane, you look like shit. - Go on. - Thank you. Go! Go! Go! * * * * * * * * * * * * Hey, this is Lina. Please leave a message. Hey, Lina. This is Anderson, um, I don't know if you've gotten any of my messages yet, but I'm in, uh, Montenegro, in Perast. And I've been looking for you. I'm assuming you're here. I thought you were here. I don't know if your phone's working yet, but, uh, I'm sure I'll see you soon. All right. I hope you're here. Okay. Bye. * * What was I doing here? I'd called her, emailed her, called all of the hostels, and nothing, not a word. I mean, what are the chances she didn't check her email or phone at this point? It all became pretty clear. She just didn't want to talk to me. So here we are, right back where we started. It's impossible to stand in that very spot and not think about what could have been. She had it right all along. Love is a drug that makes us come together so we can mate. Well, I guess that's the whole story. I was dumped in Montenegro. Twice. If I had gotten on that train, maybe all of this would've been different. There's a moment when people open up and things are possible. In all honesty, I wanted to get away from the movie business, out of the rat-race. And back to who I was when I began all this. Of course, I didn't expect to lose Lina, ruin my career and be on my way to bankruptcy. Well, I guess you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Here I am, playing out one half of a very romantic scene. The sad truth is, people in the movie business are right. Good old-fashioned romance is dead. Of course, even in the most cynical world... Can't lose 'em all. * What are you doing here? Oh, I came to find you. God, I've been looking everywhere for you. * So what about the film? Oh, fuck the film. I'll write something better. And that's the way that two people who don't believe in long term love found themselves kissing in the setting sun in Montenegro. If you don't believe me, I've got the credit history to prove it. * * * * Do you guys take Visa? Of, course, it's everywhere you want to be. I cannot believe we got a boat. I can't believe that guy took Visa. Who would've thought? It's incredible. - It's incredible. - The world nowadays. The fisherman pulls out his iPhone and goes, "No problem, no problem." Wow. I can't believe that we are actually sailing off into the sunset. Come on. Come on, who do you think we are? We're not sailing off into the sunset. No? - We're not those kind of people. Hell, no, we're rowing off into the sunset, okay? It's completely different. The next time we're gonna live out a cliche, can we at least include a motor? I'm with you. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
