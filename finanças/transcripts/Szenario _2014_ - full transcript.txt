Thursday, 17 December 1970 Sigrid Neumann stood me up, despite three postcards from me. M. went upstairs with me at 5 p.m., no photos. Red skirt, white sweater. First smoked a few cigarettes, then went to bed at 5:30 p.m. She left her white sweater and bra on. M. was very sweet to me, cuddly. First we cuddled in bed and then I removed her white panties. After I had played with her clit for a while, she put her right leg over my legs, so that her cunt was wide open, she had an orgasm. I couldn't get it up though, since the stress with a certain person about Christmas had gotten me down. She played with me tenderly until I got a hard-on. Then sex, on back. I came very very quickly. M. probably didn't get much from it, but she was very loving and understanding to me. Not hurtful. Then we cuddled like spoons facing the wall and slept from 6 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., stayed in bed until 7 p.m. Quotation from: Max Frisch, Biography: A Game. Seagull Books. London, New York, Calcutta. 2010. Page 48. "Do you believe that an individual’s biography is, after all, actually binding, an expression of necessity – or that... .. I might as well have a quite different biography by accident, and that the one we end up with one day, this biography with all the dates that we are so fed up with, this one is not even necessarily the most likely one: it is merely one option, one out of many which would be just as possible under the same social and historical conditions, and with the same preconditions of the person? What then, if you look at it this way, can a biography tell us at all? You understand – whether this biography is better or worse is not the question here. I just refuse to give meaning to everything that once happened – just because it happened, just because it became history and is therefore irreversible – I refuse to give it a meaning which it doesn’t deserve." A room of uncertain size. White walls, dark floor. A chair, a brown wooden table. On it a black leather briefcase, a tape recorder and a microphone. The tape is running. A woman's voice comes from the tape. She is reading documents, each of which has an archive number. Steps are heard, a woman enters the room, steps to the table, puts on white cotton gloves, opens the briefcase and takes out various documents, photographs, and items, which she lines up on the table. The tape continues to run. Document No. D 004 Monday, 7 September 1970 During the lunch break Rosi said to Monika: "Mrs. Schiecks, you have a poor character. You're ruining a marriage." Tuesday, 8 September 1970 Approx. 10 a.m. Monika said to me: "You're going to let your wife insult me? That's it with sex, mount your wife, do whatever you want, you're not getting anything more from me." As a result my wife had to apologize to Mrs. Schiecks during the lunch break on 8 September 1970. Afterwards, Tuesday, 8 September 1970 After work went upstairs, 5:15 – 5:30 p.m. made love one time, on back. Afterwards went to Old Cologne. Wednesday, 9 September 1970 "My husband," said Monika, "made love to me on 8 September from about 9:50 until 10:30 p.m., and wanted to again in the early morning of Wednesday, 9 September, but I had gotten my period." Menstruation: early Wednesday, 6 o'clock. Main characters in this story: A woman called Monika and a man called Hans. Hans documents in writing that Monika has threatened him – her boss, employer, and lover – with the withdrawal of her sexual favors if his wife doesn't apologize to her. Monika is successful. The wife apologizes to her and on the same day Monika and Hans make love in the flat "upstairs," above the office. In the morning of that same day, Hans writes, Monika's husband Walter also slept with her. Assuming… Assuming the man named Hans isn't writing about extrordinary events. Not about wishes, fantasies, dreams or nightmares – but about facts. About plain, ordinary reality. A handbook for secretaries from 1970 offers the trite wisdom: "That which people assume to be real is real." Romance in the office Secretary 1970? Shorthand: unsatisfactory. Diligence: deficient. Sex: excellent. My [---]'s secretary destroyed our marriage (a wife) Assuming that this reality, as described by someone other than Monika, is also Monika's own – and that she is an average representative of this reality. A few considerations as to Monika's identity as a representative of her country, her home town, her generation, her gender, her level of education, her professional and family situation: Sources: German Parliament, 6th legislative period, Report VI/3689, Appendix 2: Women in Families and Professions 1970 Statistical Almanac of the City of Cologne 1970 The Almanac of Public Opinion 1968-1973 Various issues of JASMIN – the Magazine for Living as a Couple and a trade journal for secretaries as well as various sociological and demographic studies, guidebooks, and daily newspapers: In 1970 about 46 million adults over the age of 16 live in the Federal Republic of Germany. 53.6% of them are women. Monika does not only belong to this majority, but also to the one-fourth of the adult population between the ages of 16 and 29. Monika is one of the 449,292 women who live in Cologne in 1970. The entire population of the city is 862,282, and Monika belongs to the 1.4% of the population that are female and born in 1946. She shares these characteristics with 6,279 other people. In the part of the city where Monika lives, there are 9,436 women. In this part of the city in 1970, there are 921 women for every 1,000 men. In the city as a whole, there are 1,088 women for every 1,000 men. Like 3,673 female inhabitants of Cologne born in the same year, and two-thirds of all West German adults, Monika is married. With only two members, the size of Monika's and her husband's household is below the 1970 West German average of 2.74 people per household. In all probability, they live in a rented apartment, on a normal street with little traffic. The apartment costs between 2.50 and 2.80 Marks per square meter, and probably has a bathroom and toilet but no central heating. It is at medium distance from the city center. If, in March 1970, Monika had been asked if she liked the view from her apartment, she would have answered "Yes" with 63% probability. In the same month, somewhat more than one-fourth of all West German adults preferred living in a large city. Exactly the same percentage preferred living in the country. Hans writes: Wednesday, 9 September 1970, Monika and I in Neukirch. Trailer and Kurfürst Hotel. Ate beef and pepper salad. Everything back to normal. Document No. D 006 Sunday, 13 September 1970 2:45 p.m. upstairs in bedroom 3 p.m. nice romp (on back and on side) 3:15 p.m. fingered Monika Slept until 5 p.m., renewed fingering, then longer love-making, on back – fantastic! Remained upstairs until 7 p.m., then dinner at Old Cologne, drove Monika home. It was a nice day. Eight days later, Hans notes that Monika doesn't want to sleep with either him or her husband Walter. On the next day: Tuesday, 22 September 1970 Smoked, drank Escorial, then went to bed at 3:30 p.m. until 3:40 p.m. Then another cigarette and went downstairs. Monika came down later. Thank you!, I said. It was really exceptionally great in bed. Sound? - Check! Scene 2-1, take 3, production sound. ... and action. Cut! In all probability, after finishing high school Monika went to a secretarial school and received a certificate. Monika is one of the 46% of West German women who had a job in 1970, and one of the nearly 60% of the working women interviewed who had a white-collar job, almost certainly in an office, with "no decision-making authority" and "performing a simple task." Soon I'll finally be rid of the schoolbooks. Thank God. – Now that you're done with school, what do you want to do? Oh, there are so many possibilities. – Yeah, there are plenty. But you've got to choose one! Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll work in an office? – So many girls want to work in an office. Do you know anything about it? Hmmm, well … .. it's warm. You don't [---] your [---], and you can get ahead! – Yeah, that happens. Mostly in the movies. Let's keep our feet on the ground. The author of "Teenager 1x1" from 1959 writes that he saw a "delightful" film recently: "Everything about it ... .. was great. The boss behaved great, he was about 30 years old, wore evening dress on every occasion, whether appropriate or not, and wrapped up the riskiest business transactions with a casual phone call. His office was as fantastic as he was – a glass palace, full of electronic brains, magnetophones, and electric typewriters. The best of all though was his secretary. The glass palace seemed to be built just for her. She had ash blond hair, wore the most fashionable dresses, and, if her clothes were any indication, must have drawn a salary that would make every managing director green with envy. She was touchingly concerned about her boss, and they got along fabulously on a personal level. He didn't just dictate letters to her, he also took her on drives to the country, or to the nearby mountains. Of course everything was completely harmless and strictly on the up-and-up.“ Many a wholesome girl has put her small-town past behind her to seek her fortune in the city on the Rhine. She may have found her boss's trust and an electric typewriter, but did she find happiness? The division head, the assistant director, even the janitor – married men. And so, month for month, the morning drive to work becomes just a little more dreary. The author of "Teenager 1x1" knows another version of the story: "The boss wasn't quite as convincing, but attractive enough that the young secretary fell in love with him, or perhaps with his car. On top of everything else he was especially friendly to her. He occasionally invited her on little outings; first they just went for coffee, then later they sometimes had dinner, then he took her to a quiet bar, and finally on weekend trips away from the city. The little secretary didn't quite know what was happening to her. She had always lived quite unassumingly, and really enjoyed finally being pampered. And besides, she was promoted to a better-paid position, and noticed, with pride, that she was treated especially well by her colleagues. She never suspected, or even understood, what they really thought about her." Document No. D 021 Tuesday, 6 October 1970, or Wednesday, 7 October 1970, Monika should begin period. Presumably will get new prescription for pill from Dr. G. on Ebert Square, since previous prescription for only one month! This letter contains the third pack of pills, empty. On Monday, 12 October 1970, received prescription for three-month supply = 3 packs of Eugynon 21, packs bought for 16.60 Marks. On Monday, 12 October 1970, 6 p.m. first pill taken from new supply for Monday. Start each pack only on Mondays (no day may be left out) = one pack a week, then stop until period comes. Consequently last pill from this empty pack taken on Sunday, 4 October 1970. Then period began Wednesday morning (7 October 1970, ... Since Monika had taken a bath on Saturday, 10 October 1970, screwed upstairs in the evening, sheet full of blood. Remaining days of period discharge after ejaculation without using towel. On 10 October Hans notes that Monika is in a bad mood, he would rather leave. After going to a restaurant and the hairdresser, she apparently perked up. They go to bed upstairs. On the next day, a Sunday, photos in the park, quick stop at the office, cola upstairs, listened to records, and photos before and after sex. Monika's ovaries produce an average of between 20 and 100 milligrams of estrogen and between 5 and 12 milligrams of androgen. These values will remain relatively constant for the next 20 years and Monika will get her period about 260 more times. If asked about her health in April 1969, she probably would have ranked it between "okay" and "very good." One year later, in July 1970, the probability of a "very good" would have risen by 8%, the probability of an "okay" would have fallen by 9. Monika's life expectancy is 76. If this expectancy is fulfilled, she will die in 2022. If Monika were asked in June 1967 if she sometimes thought about death, she would have answered "never" with a 49% probability. 3½ years later, a nearly identical percentage of people in her age group will admit that they don't believe in life after death. 44% of mid- and low-level white-collar workers are of the same opinion. If Monika were to die in 1970 – for whatever reasons – she would be one of 97 female deaths in her part of the city and one of 5,157 female deaths in the entire city. Most of the women aged between 20 and 25 died in May, July, and November. In total, 15 women in this age group died in 1970. Six of these 15 women died as a result of an accident, another six as a result of illness, one died during a miscarriage, and one was murdered. None of these 15 women committed suicide. Seven of the 15 were married, none of them were divorced. If, however, Monika were one of the 14 married Catholic women who committed suicide in 1970, the motive probably would have been "emotional depression." Monika would have taken her life with "poison or similar substances." If the motive had been "marriage problems," her death would have resulted from “falling from a great height.” All three women who committed suicide in 1970 because of "heart-ache" also chose "poison or similar substances." Love Your City Sunday, 11 October 1970, as described, approx. 3 p.m. shagged with Monika upstairs, that evening Walter shagged her. Concession from Monika: "He's my husband, after all." In Stracks at 7 p.m. I said to Walter: "I ate lunch with Moni, drove her to Aunt A., then went back to the office." In Stracks, Walter made advances to Monika and felt up both legs. She said: "Don't do that here, later." At 9:30 Walter said: "Let's hit the road" – (Monika wasn't very nice to Walter at all, since she had been in bed with me at 3 p.m.) Document No. D 034 25 October 1970 After lunch, it was approx. 1:15 p.m., drove to E. Street. Nearly ran into my wife, as she came from buying cigarettes. We waited on L. Street until the air was clear, then went upstairs. Monika wore: dress, light blue, with white and brown skirt, high white boots and a persian wool jacket with mink collar. Some photos in the bar, drank orange juice and an Escorial, watched TV and listened to records. 2:15 p.m. I said: "Shall we?" She said yes, took off the brown dress and first put on the red dress with the low neckline. 2:20 p.m. in bed. Completely naked, both. M. always lies on the inside and turns to face me. I wanted to play with her pussy, but she said "it burns, it hurts." Thereupon we fucked. First, for a short time on back, then she bent right leg and I threw my left leg over it. This position pushed my body up. She fucked me back hard so that I came relatively fast. She kept going until it slipped out. One more cigarette was smoked and then only one photo after fucking, she didn't want to. M. said: "That was the last time, it burns like fire and I'm not a robot." Approx. 3 p.m. drove to P. Street, where I dropped her off at the garage. She said: "I'm going to tell Walter that you called and asked if we'd be at Stracks tonight. You'll be there, right?" I confirmed. Last Sunday Walter and Walter's mother said: "Something's not right about you and Hans being together so much." Seven conditional clauses directed at cuckolded husbands: If your wife starts buying pretty lingerie, gets a new hair style, daydreams, is suddenly interested in the stock market, rearranges the furniture and needs more pocket money … If your wife goes to the hairdresser, to the tailor, or to the dentist strangely often, or visits her friend, or goes twice to see her mother, who lives in a different city ... If your wife claims to be tired, have a headache or not feel well when you go to bed ... If you find a large bouquet when you come home in the evening ... If your wife suddenly has a new piece of jewelry that looks valuable, but that she claims is costume jewelry ... If your wife suddenly starts locking the door while taking a bath ... If you suspect, that your wife is cheating on you with someone at the office where she works ... Although her husband earns decently, Monika would say that she works to supplement the household income. Her husband probably approves of her working. In all probability Monika takes care of the house, does the shopping, and runs any errands pertaining to city hall. Monika believes that she will continue to work until she no longer can. If Monika could choose again, she would, in all probability, choose the same profession. Under no circumstances would she rather be a housewife. Monika works in an office, full-time, five days a week for the same number of hours every day. The workday is eight hours long. There's no time clock, and Monika doesn't have to work nights. The lunch break is between 30 and 60 minutes long, and there is at least one other break during the day. Monika might be one of the few who occasionally work overtime. Monika has a little more than three hours of free time each day. Time during which she can do whatever she wants. Monika goes out several evenings a week. If asked where a woman could go without a male escort, she would probably rule out the following places and occasions: A bar, dancing, dinner at a restaurant, and a social event or party at a married couple's home. On the other hand it is highly probable that she would go to the movies without a male escort. In September 1969, every tenth woman between 16 and 29 said that she wouldn't go anywhere without a male escort. A few questions: Which part of the day do you prefer: the time that you are at work, or the time that you are not at work, or do you like both the same? Does it ever seem to you that time passes slowly on Sundays or holidays? Do you think it would be best not to have to work at all? Would you consider yourself more the cheerful or more the earnest type? Do you sometimes feel lonely? Do you have many or few friends and acquaintances? Do you sometimes play the lottery? On 27 October Hans writes that Monika was in a bad mood from noon to 5 p.m. After they talked for an hour, "french kisses again and again." As a result of a "preventative apology" on his part, everything was okay again. On the next day, bad cramps in her right calf, possibly thrombosis. The doctor suggested she change her pill. Hans writes: On Sunday, 1 November 1970, the first pack she's taking for me is finished anyway. Consequently period likely Wednesday. Sunday trip to Trier on 1 November: Monika allows Hans to feel her up in the car, but refuses to have sex with him. That happens the next day, Monday, 2 November, after work. Monika tries on a dress Hans bought for her, Hans writes that the sex was wonderful. "Several photos," and the next day after work: dinner, photos, 2 Escorial, sex, on back and in 'special position', afterwards several photos of Monika in front of the golden mirror in her panties and stockings. Document No. D 038 Monika plans to tell Walter that she has to go out of town for two days to see a psychologist. Supposedly I will drive her there, but actually she wants to go upstairs and not come to work on Friday, since there's the danger that Walter might call or even come into the office. I am to tell Walter that I've got dates on Thursday and Friday, so I can't come to Stracks alone, actually can't come at all. I'll have to get groceries, etc. beforehand, since Monika doesn't want to leave the apartment from Thursday until Saturday morning. She's doing whatever she can to keep me from meeting any other women I might want to fuck. That would be the end! Walter should get the impression that I'm seriously looking for another woman. On the other hand I can clearly see that Monika becomes very, very jealous if I admit that even one thing is good about someone new I've met. I'm only allowed to see women on an hourly basis (one-night stands). In 1970, the average age of women seeking a partner in the personal ads is 37. The average age of men doing the same is 39. Two-thirds of the women, but only half of the men conceal their age. While women of all ages seek men who are 8 to 12 years older, men, the older they get, prefer ever younger women. And while every third woman is looking for a "partner," only every tenth man uses the word "partner" in his ad. Men primarily advertise for a "lady." This word appears in 40% of the advertisements. ... that's when you really have to get ahold of yourself, you have to think! You can't let go of all reason! Where would we be if every girl, or in my case, me, if every time I'm in a sentimental mood, or if I'm hurting, if I jump into bed with some man. In that moment you have to ... .. your brain has to kick in ... .. and you have to think: Heavens, where will that lead? What are you doing? You've always got to have that thought in your head. – Well, that depends on how every individual sees it. You can't just rashly say ... .. and ... as if you're thinking rationally. Sometimes it just doesn't work. Everybody's different. Maybe one day you'll be in the same situation, and afterwards you'll say "Now I'm convinced ... you can't always be rational." What nice lady would like to get to know an independent business man (38) with car and secure income? No Adonis, but interested in cultural activities. Marriage possible at future date. Gentleman, 41 / 5' 11", seeking simple, poor girl or woman, with or without children, for possible marriage at future date. Man, 41, 5' 8", with good job, sophisticated, with apartment and car, looking for pretty, charming lady for marriage at later date. Businessman, mid-40s, with free time during day, seeks girlfriend. Financially independent businessman in responsible position, late 30s, looking for acquaintance and friendship with lady who likes company and appreciates pleasant hours together. Document No. 045, hand-written letter Angelika Janzen Cologne-Mülheim X St. Tel. xxx-xxxx Cologne, 30 October 1970 Today I am finally able to respond to your advertisement in the Cologne City Newspaper, which I found very interesting. I am 39 years old, slim, medium-blond and divorced as the innocent party. Should you be interested in meeting, you can ... Met Mrs. Angelika Janzen, from Cologne-Mülheim, X Street, Tel. xxx-xxxx, at 7:10 p.m. at the revolving door at Schultheiß. I found her attractive - well-dressed and pleasant to talk to. We drove to Hemmersbach for dinner near St. Agnes. Since no tables were free, we sat with Walter and Monika at theirs – they didn't let on. When another table became available, Mrs. Janzen wanted to move there, so we did. Mrs. Janzen: divorced 3 years ago, 14-year-old daughter comes to visit her every two weeks – Saturday, 7 November, 21 November 1970, etc. Walter and Monika left after they had eaten, went to the Juwelier on Neuß Square, 8 p.m. Mrs. Janzen and I went to Stracks at 8:15 p.m. I liked this woman – she has a gentleman friend from Duisburg who visits her once a week (!). At 10 p.m. Monika gave me clear signals that she wanted to see me. I spontaneously made my apologies to Mrs. Janzen. Monika made a scene (jealousy). There'd be no more intercourse between us, I should go screw Mrs. Janzen, etc. Later she calmed down and promised: to go upstairs on Thursday, 5 November 1970, at 5 p.m. and to stay there until 7:30 p.m., thereupon to go to Schultheiß, where she would meet a 6' 2" man named Dumm. I was to meet there at 8 p.m., one Vera Nowak from Leverkusen, X Street, Tel. xxx-xxxx. Monika plans to jilt Mr. Dumm and get rid of him around 9:30, with the excuse that she has to meet someone. I should do the same so we can be alone together, which she prefers. Do you think that most people are trustworthy? Do you think there are more malicious people than benevolent people in the world? Would you consider yourself more the cheerful or the earnest type? Do you have many or few friends and acquaintances? Do you sometimes feel lonely? If you were to be born again, would you rather be a man or a woman? Document No. D 047 Thursday, 5 November 1970 Monika called around 11 o'clock and said: "Schnaggel? I still haven't gotten my period! Dr G. says it could be hormonal and I should stop taking the pill! If I'm pregnant, I don't need the pill anyway. And if I'm not, I've still got two months worth of pills. If I'm pregnant I'm going to get rid of it. I'll get the shots in the next couple of days!!!" Otherwise she was in a good mood. Saturday, 7 November 1970 11:30 this morning at M's. Annoyed since no period yet. (Supposed to come on Wednesday, 4 November). Walter took Monika home from Stracks just after midnight Friday night and wanted to screw. M. lied to him, said she had period. He didn't check – he never does – Between the 6th and the 12th of November, Hans meets with a woman named Gabriele Brückner, sleeps with her and tells Monika a harmless story. Monika, on the other hand, wants him to tell her husband that he "screwed" this Brückner woman. Hans continues to meet with Gabriele Brückner, whom he considers "sex-starved" because she moans in bed and enjoys herself. Meanwhile, Monika doesn't want to sleep either with Hans or her husband, which leads to a big fight between the husband and wife. Sunday, 8 November 1970 Monika, icy cold, she still hasn't gotten her period, which should have come on Wednesday, 4 November 1970. She said: "It's my fault. Why did I ever get involved with you, I might be pregnant and I don't even know whose it is. I've been doing it with both you and Walter and I let you both come inside of me since I was counting on the pill." "I'll get an abortion and then, Hans, there will be no more intercourse between us! I can't take this agony, I don't even know which one of you might have gotten me pregnant!" When Monika came to the office on Tuesday, 10 November 1970, she said: "Well, I'm pregnant. I told Dr. G. that I'll be out of town from Wednesday, 11 November 1970 onwards. I'm going to call a certain Marion (lives near Ebert Square, prostitute and married housewife), she knows someone who can get rid of it." Monika was very loving to me on Tuesday, since she knew that I'd pay, support her, possibly marry her. Thursday, 12 Nov. 1970 Abortion, 9:10 a.m. - Period, 3 p.m. Admission ticket Grand Carnival Ball on Saturday, the 14th of November, 1970 at 8 p.m. On the same day Hans writes: Monika is demanding and wants to have her sex every day, as she told me. Thus Walter has to screw her nearly twice a day or more, when she isn't ill. Wednesday evening, 11 November 1970, went home from Stracks approx. 9 p.m. Monika let me screw her two times, 20 minutes apart. She knew she was pregnant so nothing could happen. Thursday, 12 November 1970 Monika has an appointment 9 a.m. at Marion's. There, Curt will do the abortion for 500 Marks. Near Ebert Square. It will be Monika's third abortion. First abortion at 17, she still lived with her parents in Bavaria. Second abortion around 19, in the sixth month. Serious complications. Delivery of a child in March 1967. Child died in hospital after five days. Third abortion 12 November 1970, approx. 9:10 a.m. at Marion's. Monika came in a taxi around 10 o'clock. I immediately took a picture of her in the doorway. Monika: "Are you crazy, don't you ever think of anything else?" Condition: Hot/cold, some stomach pain. Went upstairs approx. 11 a.m. What stage of a person's life do you think is the best: childhood, youth, the 20s and 30s, middle age or old age? If you were to be born again, would you rather be a man or a woman? Do you sometimes feel lonely? Is it a familiar feeling for you, that life often seems so senseless? Did you enjoy this year's Carnival season, or have you never much liked Carnival? Assuming that Monika occasionally plays the lottery, she will, with a 50% probability, always choose the same numbers. With a 46% probability she will spontaneously choose numbers, and with a 38% probability she will choose birthdays, anniversaries, and similar numbers. The probability is high that Monika will say of herself that in her life up to now she has, more or less, been lucky. Especially with regard to her education, her job and professional success, as well as her health. For 44% of all West German women asked in March of 1970, success in life depends as much on luck as on ability. 40% of the women believe that ability alone determines success. Thursday, 26 November 1970 Today Monika was ready to fuck. We went upstairs at 5 p.m. and at 5:30 we were screwing in bed. I was worried I couldn't get it up. But it worked and ... .. once again Monika made me ejaculate very quickly. I screamed loudly: "Monika, Monika." Afterwards we got out of bed and at 5:45 Monika said: "Please give me some cotton, I think I've got my period." Menstrual bleeding. Lasted until we parted at 8:15. So she hasn't taken the pill since the abortion! If it is her period, she'll resume taking pill on Monday, 30 November 1970. Today it was very nice and harmonious with Monika. On the next day, Monika and Hans tell Monika's husband Walter that they plan to visit Hans' mother at the rest home next Sunday. A pretense. They actually spend the entire day upstairs at Hans's. After an argument in bed about Hans' selfishness during sex: sleep, coffee and cake, TV and a phone call to Berleburg, where Monika and her husband, together with Hans and a date, plan to spend the Christmas holidays. The above-mentioned Gabriele Brücker accepts the invitation, but then changes her mind, apparently that same evening. Document No. D 063 Thursday, 3 December 1970 7pm, met (among others): Miss Ute Schneider, Cologne-Ehrenfeld, Ehrenfeld St. (new building next to post office), near Groß's Restaurant. Turned 21 in November 1970, tall, thin, very good looking. White boots, fashionable green dress, black hair. Took her home at 7:30pm, picked up Monika to take her to Stracks. On the way to Stracks Monika asked if I'd met the 21-year-old. I confirmed and said I would be bringing her on the Christmas holidays, since she had accepted. Monika immediately said, even though she had not seen her, "you've caught fire for her, don't bring her along, Hans, as a favor to me, not her!" I remained adamant, and Monika opened the passenger door on Subbelrather Street, corner of Inner Canal Street, and jumped out. Although I turned right onto Subbelrather Street and requested Monika to get back into the car, she refused and continued on foot to Stracks, carrying packages from the dry-cleaners and an umbrella. I turned the car and immediately drove to Ute Schneider's, Cologne-Ehrenfeld, Ehrenfeld Street (second floor left, first door). When Hans arrives with Ute at Stracks, Monika is not yet there. They sit down at one of the tables and order a plate of mussels. When Monika arrives, she ignores them. Shortly thereafter the owner calls Hans to the bar. Monika tells Hans that she left her umbrella in his car, asks him to walk with her to the car. Hans writes: In the car she implored me to dump the girl immediately, not to take her along for the holidays. Monika was beside herself, since this girl was superior to her in terms of age, height, and beauty, exceptionally tastefully dressed and had an educated appearance. I remained adamant and said to Monika: "You've always wanted me to find someone new, especially for the Christmas holidays. That after Christmas the fucking is over and that you can't handle two relationships! Besides, you've been more reserved with me recently, and your interpretation was that I have to slowly wean myself from you." Monika said: "Let her go, I'll do anything for you." I told Monika that I couldn't leave the girl sitting alone, she could stay in the car, I was going in. We (Ute and I) only ate half the mussels. Meanwhile, Monika played songs on the jukebox like "You" and "Don't Pass Me By" and other of my favorites. It drove me crazy! Hans takes Ute upstairs. He shows her an album of nude photos, they drink cognac. Hans kisses her and rubs her thighs. The doorbell rings and a man named Decker, evidently an employee in Hans' office on the night shift, informs Hans that Monika is on the telephone. Hans tells him to say he isn't there. He writes: Later that same night Monika threw a fit with her husband and said: "I'm getting a divorce!" Which of the following have you done in the last three months? Dressed differently? Visited a new area? Found a new friend? Made a new acquaintance? Had good luck? Had particularly bad luck? When you think about the future – do you think that people's lives are becoming easier or more difficult? Do you think that our children will have a better and happier life than we do? Do you believe in progress – I mean, that humanity is striding toward an ever better future, or don't you think so? Hans writes that Monika was "in a good mood, tender, cuddly" on St. Nicholas Day. Visited his mother together at the rest home, afterwards "upstairs", 2x sex, several photos. Hans writes: All in all: Monika was very, very kind and loving and flexible, cuddly. She was just as I wish a woman in love to be. We rested in bed, her head on my chest. I sucked her breasts, kissed them. It was absolutely wonderful. Afterwards they just miss Walter in Stracks, and on the next day Monika forbids Hans to call her at home in the future. Hans wonders if Walter has gotten suspicious. Same day: dinner together at Prince Eugen and the first pill after the abortion. Tuesday, 8th, Thursday, 10th, Sunday 13th, and Tuesday 15th December, Monika and Hans meet "upstairs," eat and sleep together, Stracks has its savings club pay-out party, and Monika invites Hans to dinner. The fuse blows once upstairs, and Hans meets a woman called Sigrid Neumann. On the day before his last diary entry, Hans makes a hand-written list of dates in 1970. First entry, 9 January: "Colored hair." Birthdays of aunts and uncles follow. On 29 January: "1st day tablets." Same entry on 26 February.
