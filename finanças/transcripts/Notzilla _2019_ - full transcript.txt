- Ah, what's that? - Huh, it's nothing. Come on, Mioko. Kaiju. - Giant monster. Groovy! - Thank you, Professor. The information you give us will help us kill the monster. Prepare the boys! - No, General, please. You must not kill Mama Notzilla. She's only trying to protect her eggs! You asked for my help and-- - And you gave it. She is too big. We must kill her, proctologist. - Paleontologist. Proctologist is a doctor who looks at... But that doesn't matter. She's only big because she ate fermented berries on Mount Sakitumi. Let me find a way to make her her true size again! - Out of the way, girly man! Yes, General. No! Mama Notzilla! It is my fault, my fault. I will save your baby. Aha! Is a sign. Ohio means hello. I would not let you out of sight, little Kaiju Is pinkie promise. Oh, I think I make big mistake. Papa-san would say I'm a fool. - Ichihiro Honda. - Papa-san? You are. Fool. - Yes, Papa-san, it's true. But I promised Mama monster that-- - You cannot bring that egg to America. They still haven't forgiven us for Kudzu. - I am sorry, Papa-san. I know I was big, disappointment to you, but-- Oh! Foreign article! Sorry, tiny soap. Oh! Sorry, tiny Kaiju. No! - Third time today and it's only 9:15. Blasted manly beard. - So following today's test of reactor core number 66, as long as it doesn't melt down we'll... Just look at you. Every man admires you and every woman desires you. How can anybody do science when you look like that? - Please, Shirley girly. I understand why you feel this way but no more of this inappropriate behavior. - I'm sorry, what, Dr. Blowheart? - Just don't let it happen again. - What? - And say, lose the Coke bottles. None of the boom boys-- - Physicists. - Like the way they look. - Well, I need them to read the charts. - Well, okay. But do the lip quiver. Ha! I love it when you do that. It's so you. All right, you can keep the glasses but only when you're dressed as a physicist. - I am a physicist. - Listen, I said I'd make you a boom boy and I will. Just let nurture take its course. Nature. - Say, under an hour. We're cooking with... Now, what's it called again? - Plutonium 239. - Right, hard to remember. They should call it something like wow powder. I brought you something. Me! Oh I'm just funnin'. But really. The mensch of mensches. - Skol! Our lives have meaning again. - Please, please, gentlemen. I understand your odor. - Ardor. - But we have science to do. How is my favorite Swedish physicist? - Actually, I'm from Mankato, don't you know. It's in Minnesota. That's German. - Oh, I can feel it. Today is the day. First there was the A bomb. Then Truman personally asked me to oversee the B, C, D, and E bombs. He let off a lot of F bombs. - Hah-hah! Hilarious. First Jerry Lewis, now you. Tres brilliant! He's French. - Yeah. - Then there was the H bomb. It was followed by the K, J, I, L-- - Dr. Shortman, have you calibrated your plutonium rods? - That's a rather personal question. Does that even mean anything? - No! - Oh! - Wait, is that estrogen I smell? Why, it could cause a hormonal explosion, men. - Think about it, men. Assuming reactor number 66 doesn't explode-- - Like reactors one through 65. - This is what men and a few unattractive women in pantsuits have dreamed of since the Garden of Eden. Unlimited power! - I think what Dr. Blowheart's-- - Let's do science, people! Everyone, attach anti-radiation devices. Now, engaging in quasi-scientific jargon Dr. Mungish, eyeball circumnavigational hydro-peppy killo-wowsers. - Inspect the structural integrity of the hydro-electric units. - Might to do that. - Dr. Shortman, check Foghorn Leghorn deportment in Chuck Jones mode, adjusting for rude condescension. - Confirm the radiation levels in the containment sleeves. - Yup. - Dr. Bloch, rotate radial tires with counterrevolutionary turbine porridge ratio. - I'm sorry, I don't even know what that one is. - I'll just flip through these toggle switches. - Dr. Butay, check my demeanor with torrid tomes of taunting technology. - Oui, I will check you very good, Dr. Blowheart. - Why do I find it so attractive when he does that? Commencing countdown in 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four-- - Ah, close enough! Commence self-throwing. - Another meltdown. - Oof, da. Plotz. - That dog'll never hunt. - Ha! Biggest one yet. Time to beat feet, toots. - I'm afraid if we keep increasing plutonium levels, we'll-- - Did you know plutonium's symbol is Pu? I love that. Yes, I did. Wait, what's that? Is it reptilian? - Could be Democrat. - Well, it must've been shaken loose from the subterranean shelf. - It's not even Easter yet. - But what period? - Probably 1920s. They were big on red. - Jurassic? - Park. - I'll X-ray it. - Well, we can talk about this at dinner along with my plans for atomic testes. - Testing. - Yes, and that's how you're behaving right now. - Testy? Uh, I'm sorry. I just need a life of my own, Doctor, I mean, mister. - Come on, Shirley girly. Where's that little giggle I love? That is so you. Okay, Mack. Four-way chili with beans and no silverware 'cause you got-- - Chopstick. Hai. - Hi. - No, sorry "Hai" means-- Yeah, I know. Just teasin'. You've been in here every day for a week. Ever eat at another restaurant? - There is other restaurant? Well, tanoshi. - Madam, wait. You know Japanese? - Looked it up, Professor. - You know I am professor? It's alive. - What is? I'll be sure not to order it. - The egg. The X-ray showed movement. I can't tell what species it is but it's definitely a living dinosaur. - Wow, probably not a lot of those. - None. - Nuns? No, Cincinnati's got lots of those. It's very Catholic. - Dinosaurs. There are definitely no living dinosaurs in Ohio. - Make that America, Doc. - Whoa, it's over there, fella. Tell Tojo we won. - You beakers need to meet this guy. - Hai. Hi. - Well, at least he speaks English. - He's a paleontologist. - How you know this? - This waitress thing is just temp, Professor. I'm an investigative reporter and I don't do fluff neither. I know a scoop when I see it. - So how come sometimes I'm stopped up for days and other times I erupt like Mount Rushmore? - No, but that's a proctologist. - This is Dr. Richard Blowheart, renowned nuclear physicist. And I'm-- - Shirley Yujest. - Yujest, Dr. Shirley Yujest, Dr. Blowheart's assistant. - I am Professor Ichihiro Honda. - Honda? Like the tiny motorcycles? - Yes, sir. But soon they make automobile. Like those will ever replace Studebaker. Yes, it is my Notzilla. I mean it is a Notzilla. - So it's some kinda hemorrhoid. - Do you know what species it is, Professor Honda? - Yes. It's Notzillasaurus Partiontilldon, normally small, about size of, say, a man in a rubber suit. It is not. But... - A Nancy boy? - Harmless. But if exposed to alcohol, it suddenly grow very big. - Funny, the opposite happens to me. - So how often do you get these giant monsters in Japan, Professor? - About every two weeks. - Well, listen, Itchy, that's swell but this is the USA. Ego, we don't have a problem with giant monsters. - Kaiju. - Gesundheit. - Arigatou. We do important stuff here like blow things up. - Well, it would be good to know more. - Can you show me where you find egg? - If you want. Yes, I very want. He's your boyfriend, Dr. Blowheart? No, no. I mean I have a great respect for him. He's my boss and a war hero. When the Germans blew up our lab in Europe, he was the only one to make it out alive. He saved thousands of government documents that became the basis for what we do at SNUGI. Would you like to see SNUGI? - SNUGI's big pillow? - Um, no. Secret Nuclear Underground Government Installation. There's a science briefing tomorrow at 8 a.m. I can put your name on the list. Here. I'll write my home address on here, you know, in case we need to-- - Connect? - Oh, and that's where we found the egg. You said it was a Notzillasaurus? Partiontilldon. A species of Flatulizard from Late Bodacious Period. I show you. You see. They are yasashii... Gentle and in control as long as they do not eat fermented berries. - Aren't we all? - Attention, SNUGI employees. Please remove all radioactive materials from pockets and underwear before leaving. Good night. - Oh, you're gonna need a bigger lampshade. Huh! - This is Dr. Shirley Yujest, actual, legitimate nuclear physicist. Please leave a message. - It's Blowheart. Where are you? This is the third time I've called. I haven't eaten yet. We need to do research and bring food. That's an ordeal. Odor. Order. Look, you wanna be a scientist or not? You little lush-a-saurus you. Oh you want some of this? Huh, you want some of this, huh? Oh yah, yeah, you want some more? Uh huh? You go, huh. This is why I never share. "Of all the gin joints in all the towns "in all the world." "The jig is up, Professor Depravo. "I'm Dougie Dougwood, boy genius." "I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille." "Rosebud." Oh! What, oh! - Dr. Blowheart, are you there? - I'm here, Shirley girly. Is that a dinosaur in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? It's alive. It hatched. Hiro will be so, I mean, Professor Honda, will be so excited. And he's kinda cute. I mean the creature of course. But how did he get so big? You didn't give him beer, did you? - Well, it's about time you got here. Help me get ready for the briefing. I need a shaver. Heck, I need a machete. Stay. - What if he escapes from your office? - If he does, he's so grounded. - Attention. Drs. Mothra and Rodan. Please meet Dr. Gorgo from Britain in the lobby. - For sure. - Oh, there he is. Genius, genius, genius, genius-- - Please. - Genius. - Please. Today you will see our insanely impressive nuclear facility, built with obscene amounts of government funding. Everything here at SNUGI has been built to flawless standards. - Oh! - Wow. - Look at that. - Each of our Uber-Fission reactors emits a thousand times more radiation than the state-of-the-art facility planned for Three Mile Island. - Oh! - Please be calm. Had that been serious, the actual room would be shaking. For your protection, Dr. Mungish will now give you something to make you look cooler than you actually are. - Eh, bon jour, - I am Dr. Jacques Butay. Please follow my manly gait to the SNUGI cafeteria where we have a great barbecue planned for you courtesy of reactor core number 66. - Oye. - I know, right? - What happened? - All I said was gee, someone oughta go out for more beer. - You do not give beer to baby especially baby Notzilla. - Notzilla? I was gonna call him Barney. - There's two things I wanna know. What creature made that? This is only the beginning. I love that line. We must meet at restaurant to form keikaku, A plan, to save Notzilla. - Or kill him. No! - What was the other thing? - Aren't we supposed to be like 500 stories under the ground? - I mean, massive quantities of radiation I can live with but a dino who bogarts the brew, never. What is it about these things? - I mean no bujoku, Dr. Blowheart-san. - No bujoku tooken. - Taken. - But if you have not given beer to Notzilla-- - Barney. - Notzilla. This genus of dinosaur has slow metabolism until it consume alcohol. Then its pituitary gland become bulbous. - So basically my whole teens. - And it grow ohhhki... Gigantical. - Like "The Amazing 60-foot Woman "with the College Degree" only less scary. - No, bigger. Big like skies-- - Skye terrier. - Skyscraper. - My Aunt Myrtle had one of those. Not that big though. - Is the effect reversible, Dr. Honda? - Yes. But in Japan, army always kill monster before I can do urinalysis. - This is no time to talk about my feelings. We gotta find this thing. - But where do we find it? - I couldn't help but overhear about the monster. This is our busboy, Bobby Bleech from Kentucky. He overheard you, too, and-- - Wait, you both overheard us? This is top secret stuff. I mean, we work in a 500-story subterrarium. - Subterranean complex. - Full of nuclear reactors, each powerful enough to destroy the Earth 10 times over and absolutely no one must know about it. Who else overheard? - Tell him what you heard, Bobby. - Hi y'all. Ooh wee. A foreign feller? - Spit it out, kid. - Well, I overheard y'all talking about a big old lizard that sucked up a heap of suds. - Sucked up a heap of my suds. - And then he broke out of y'all's office and went looking for more? - Yes. - Dang, ain't those just the best? - I know, right? - Tell 'em about the phone call, Bobby. - Oh right. Well, 'bout an hour ago, my grandpa, I live with my grandpa down near Kowabunga Bay, he calls and says some big old critter just like the one y'all's talking about, it took all our beer! - Taken. - We must go there at once. - I'll call a cab. - Well, butter my button, call me a biscuit. Look at what he done done to our garage. - Only a monster could do this. - It's not so bad. - Are you blind? Open your eyes. - If he was blind, how would that help? - Was he raised in a barn? - In egg actually. - Look. He left the front door open. - I do not think Notzilla did that. - Check inside. I bet he left the toilet seat up and the lights on. - Why would he do this to our garage? - Did he take anything, Bobby? I'll just go check on the fan belt. - What did he take? - I don't reckon he actually... Wait? Yeah, he did. Grandpa's beer. He taked it all. - Took, go on. - Grandpa, he likes having a little beer around on them cold Kowabunga nights. - How much? - 'Bout 80 or 90 cases. He has a lot of girls around. Wait, where is he? Grandpa. Grandpa. What's this? - Where? - Over here. - Ah ha. It's just as I suspected. The monster has grown... Lots bigger. Yes. This is actually what I want. - What is it, Itchy? Mmm, tastes like beer only salty and warm. - He has gone to river. - What, did he leave a note? - No. His species is born in water. River will remind him of his mother. - Aww. - Also, as you say, Blowheart-san, it's lot bigger. Do you have boat? - Yes, we have boat. I mean, yes, SNUGI has a research ship. - He must be stopped. This is only the beginning. - How often does he say that? - Dr. Bloch, did you bring the prestidigious shooty device? - Animal tranquilizer gun. - Oh, for sure. - What? - Yah, you betcha. - Great. - Actually, I do not think Dr. Bloch is Swedish, Blowheart-san. I think he's black American person. - What? Nonsense. Scientists are white and male. Dr. Bloch is a first class scientist, ego, he's white. Next you're gonna try to tell me that someone on my team is a female! Dr. Butay, did you load the extraterrestrial webby-grabber? - Animal capture net. - I do not need a translation, female assistant person. I speak Manly Nuclear Physicist fluently! Check, Dr. Blowheart! - Are we ready, Skipper? Where's our normal captain? - He's out sick. This is Captain Bleech. Bleech, huh? - Ooh, it feels about 150 pounds heavier than it did in the lab. - 117. - What is it? A radar. - Correction. It is a super-secret atomic radar percolator. - Device. No, just device. It's okay. - Most impressive. What does it do? - The same thing as a normal radar except it's atomic. - Ego, it's better. Ah, there's nothing more bracing than the smell of salt water. - He knows this is river, yes? - Time to do science, people. Dr. Butay, man the webby wobbler. - Oui, Dr. Blowheart. I will man the capture nets in the most masculine of manly ways. - Oy. - Oh ho ho. - Blowheart-san, I fear net is too small. I have calculated Notzilla consumed 28,000 liters of fermented yeast molecule. - Plus all that beer. - From his urinalysis, I conclude that alcohol work like fission. It causes his cells to... - Swell? - Yes. - No, nothing's swell about it, Shirley girly. Anything on the super-secret-- - Radar? No, nothing yet, Doctor. Maybe it's the antenna. Had that trouble with my TV. Or it could be the urinary decatheter. - Wait, wait, there are two objects very near. Actually they're here. - How many Thin Mints? Well, Itchy, it looks like your little iguana wasn't so swell after all. Time to call it a night. - I'm picking something up. - Big deal, so am I. - Yes, I see him! - How close? - Really close. Ow. Look, it is Notzilla. And busboy. Oh. - Oh, Bobby hid in that barrel. Wait, why is there a barrel of nuclear waste? - We missed Thursday's trash pick up. - Blowheart-san, Notzilla swell very good. Look. - Pikachu! Mmm, no, no, no, no, no. - Notzilla, you killed my grandpa and now you're gonna pay. - Bobby. - Grandpa? - Come on, paly, lose the heat and be cool. - Whoa. Oh ho ho. Whoa. Gnarly. - He's too big for river. He's going to shore now. - I just picked him up on the radar. - You mean the super-secret-- - Yeah, yeah. And it looks-- - Yes? - It looks like-- - Yes? - I looks like he's headed for-- - Yes? - Cincinnati! - I knew it. That always happens. - The music or the bit about the monster heading for the city? - Both. And I'm the one to stop him. This is only the beginning. - That's like the 10th time he's said that. - I told you, I don't wanna play strip Scrabble, Larry. Oh. - I bring strange red egg from Japan then I accidentally flush it down airplane toilet. - I sorta guessed. Would you like to-- - Sorry, nervous make me thirsty. Ew. This is terrible. - Yeah, it's new. They call it diet soda. - It tastes like-- - Dinosaur pee. - Kinda like beer only salty. - And warm. Hiro, why would you come all the way to America just to-- - Save egg? My father was soldier who kill many men. He always say, "Itchy." I hate he call me this. "Real man kill." He always make me feel shame for not wanting to kill. But I always thought even as boy no, Papa-san, real man does not kill. Real man saves. And so I dedicate my life to save creature no one else-- - Understands? - Hai. Yes. I know is not manly but-- - Hiro, I think it's the most manly thing I've ever heard. Close. My dad was a geologist. He always said to follow your heart. - Heart go out of chest? - No, it's an expression. But he died when I was 10. And then Mom said, "Shirley, be more like a girl." And then I majored in physics and she said, "Girls can't be scientists." And Dr. Blowheart says the same thing. - He's right. Girl cannot be scientist. - But I thought you would-- - Only woman can be scientist. Blowheart-san. I mean, Richard. I mean, Dr. Blowheart. Dr. Shirley Yujest. I'll never be accepted as a real nuclear physicist without him. - Shirley girly, where are you? Pick up, I need you! Let's see. Attack. Disasters. Monsters. Hollywood. Ah, we don't have a budget for that. Well, Pentagon. - Pentagon. - Yes, this is Dr. Richard Blowheart, legendary nuclear physicist. - Hold please. - Wait, I don't think you realize who you're talking to. ♪ Fly me to Ft. Wayne ♪ ♪ Let me play amongst the corn ♪ ♪ Hey let me see ♪ ♪ What love is like ♪ - Catchy. ♪ In Peoria and Des Moines ♪ - Sorry, Satanists again. They wanted the Pentagram. Your dime. - Yes, I need to speak to the head of the U.S. Armed Forces. - Yeah, well, the head and the feet and even those useless little hairs that you get in your ears of the Armed Forces are all in a meeting. Some kind of kerfuffle in Cuba. - Look, I happen to be head of a atomic testes for all of southwest Ohio, ego, I-- - Putting you through. - What? To who? - Try changing the filter. - What? This is Dr. Richard Blowheart. Who's this? - Dr. Richard Blowheart? - No, I am. Who is this really? - This is four-star Frigid Air General Dirk Bogus. - Brigadier General? - No, Frigid Air General. I'm head of military refrigeration for all of southwestern Ohio. Very strategic. - Oh. Well, I need to speak to whoever's in charge. - Hello? Hello? Cuba. Yes. That would be me. - Oh, I see. Well, we have a little monster problem. Make that a big monster problem with serious flatulence. Ego, we're gonna need some ginormous firepower and some legendary heroic action. - Yes! - What? - I'll round up the firepower! - Great, I'll bring the bean dip! - Ciao, baby. - Kenny? - Uncle Dirk? - You still want to be a filmmaker? - Dude, I thought you were gonna wipe out on that last curl, but you totally slotted it! That's totally gonna be a thing. You're gonna score yourself beaucoup brew, dude! Don't OD, you party animal! Oh man, the dino shreds! - You brought the tripod, right? Please, Uncle B. Does Francois Truffaut forget his tripod? Ah, Colonel Stickler. What's our firepower? - 17 tanks, 13 rocket launchers, and a dozen fighter jets en route, sir. - Good. And are the extras, I mean, what do you call them? The troops, amassed? - 650 on Dookie Hill. - Tough soldiers? - All made out of the same high quality polymer as the artillery. Plus more arriving as we speak. - You getting this, Kenny? - Hello? Rolling! - How many arriving? - Hard to say. - And my co-star? - I'm sorry, sir? - The dinosaur, darn it! - Oh, he's been spotted a mile away. - How's the light, Kenny? Warm, sanguine, perfect contrast to the impending carnage. But we gotta roll now or we're gonna lose our irony. - You heard him. Cue talent, cue irony! - But I can't just... Right, sir. Colonel Mustard, fire a rocket volley to draw the, uh, talent's attention. - Yes, sir. - Closer. It was an ironic, sang... sang... - Sanguine. - Sanguine morning when Dirk Bogus, four-star General-- Four. When Dirk Bogus faced the monster from-- - The pit! - Pittsburgh! - No! - General Bogus, he's here, and I think he's seen us! Eh! Yes, he definitely has. - Excellent. Action! - Rocket launchers, now! He's bouncing them around as if they were nothing but toys! - What about the soldiers? - Sir, if the rockets can't stop him, I don't see how bullets-- - Use bigger bullets! Fire, men! How's it look, Kenny? Hideous! Surreal! Kafka-esque! - Good fear, people! - Sir, the jets are here! He got us! - We got him! - And now he's heading for Cincinnati! - We must go there immediately. - Right, sir! - And develop this footage! - I'm here to save the... Hello? - Good evening. A huge imported monster broke through our Dookie defense today and is believed to be headed towards Cincinnati. Ooo, lovely fuchsia sunrise, General! - Oh, thanks. Thanks, I call it sanguine. - Is it true you plan to capture the monster? - Not just capture him. I want to capture his, I want to... - His essence. I want to capture his essence, the darkness that lives inside each one of us, the primal yearning to-- - Primitive yearning... - In other news, Troop 336 sold a record number of Thin Mints this week! I will save you! - I will crush you! Shirley? - No, it's Bogus. - What is? - I am. - No kidding! You said 8 a.m. I show up 10 minutes late, 10 minutes, and no one's there! - Right. So, listen, this is a little embarrassing, but we had a little trouble with your monster today and, well, now all the stores are closed and Amazon hasn't been invented yet, so I was wondering if you had any super-secret atomic weapons lying around. - Well, I'd have to look around and see if... Why, yes, of course, what was I thinking? We have a super-secret atomic weapon here. We'd have to build a full-sized version of it or get down low and look up. You know how when you get down really low and you look up at something it's like, oh wow, it's so big! - Great! Can you bring it to-- - Oh no you don't, Bogus boy! I operate this baby myself! I'm the hero here! - Well, I hope it backfires in your face, Mr. Poopyface! - That's Dr. Mr. Poopyface to you! - Hello, my name is Ichihiro Honda. You kill my monster. Prepare to-- - Itchy. Itchy, you are not a true man! - Papa-san? Please, I cannot be you. - Itchy, you'll never be a real man! - Blowheart-san? Please, I cannot... - Itchy-- - Do not call me Itchy! I am Hiro! Oy. I wish I did not skip karate class in high school now. - Itchy? You look so calm and so clean-shaven. - Zen. - Really? Wow. Listen, I know things have been strained between us. - Strained? We're talking baby poo. It's time to quit pussyfooting around and kill that pet iguana of yours. It's a threat to mankind! - You are threat to mankind! - It's ugly and gassy! - You are ugly and gassy! - It's a toy truck dressed in pink polka-dotted pantaloons! - You are toy truck in... What? Hah! Made you say it! Oh, wow, you're just so immature! I can't believe I like ever even let you hang out with me! Listen to us. You're right. I don't have time for this. I have a super-secret Uber-Fission Mega-Blaster to build! - What is this blaster? - It's a nuclear canon that shoots 200 radioactive rays with more firepower than the entire Peloponnesian Wars! Or one of those wars. - And this is safe? - It'll leave a radioactive cloud over Cincinnati for about 50 years but after that you'll never even know it was there. Anyway, it's for my... It's for their own good. - You are completely crazy person! - Real men kill, Itchy. - No, Papa-san! - Papa who? - Hoo! Why did I skip karate class? Wait... I win 5th Grade Composition contest! Warning! I have black belt in haiku! - Haiku? Isn't that-- - Japanese poetry, yes. And is devastating when delivered by 5th Grade Master! Each falling leaf is like a butterfly whose life has reached conclusion. Why does my old dog who has no eyes see more than I shall ever see? - God, I love dogs. The boy stood on the burning deck! - How many summers shall leave before the winter stays forevermore? Is about death. - I know, I just figured that out. "Listen my children and you shall hear "of the midnight ride of--" - Warriors storm castle, but hearts can only be conquered with arrows of love. - Here I sit brokenhearted, tried..." I give! Your words are so sparse and yet so profoundly infused with meaning. - I will stop you and save Notzilla! Fine, and I guess we can't be friends! Finding targets. I shall return. Dr. Blowheart. When we started SNUGI you said I'd be a physicist within three months. But it's been three years, three years, and yet I realize I still need you to teach me how to be a real scientist. Plus, you're so insanely handsome! - Please, Shirley girly, I'm happy to be your role model, but no more of this inappropriate behavior! - Stop, stop it! Stop it! First of all, I don't need you to be my role model! Second, it's ergo, not ego as in let the air go out of your ego. And third, my last name isn't girly! - I don't think of you as just a Shirley. With that girly little giggle of yours and that little lip quiver. - That you make me do! I hate those! - But they're so you! - You know what? You're right. - I am? - Yeah, and I don't think of you as a Richard, either. - Really. - No. You're really more of a Dick. - Ha. - Oh! - I should go back and apologize. But if I don't, I'll, mmm... Be more like a girl, Shirley! - I am a girl, Mom! And a scientist! But he treats me more like, like I'm his personal geisha! Isn't that what you are? - No! I could never look at myself like that. - You are not a true man! - What? Who are you? - Sorry, wrong mirror. - Larry, I told you, I don't want to... Professor. Hiro. I was just talking to your father. Yes, because I kick him out of my reflection. Would you like a glass of-- - Dinosaur pee? - Tonight "8 1/2 Samurai" is on Public Service television! It is sequel to my favorite movie! - Oh, well, good. I could use a break from destroying my career. - Tomorrow I face certain death. As my personal geisha, you will comfort me. - You smell like a sumo wrestler so you will take a bath. - You will bathe me, little Lotus Bottom. No! And it is Lotus Blossom! Stop it! This is my fantasy! Why do I always have to translate everything that you say? - Huh, perhaps it is because we are dubbed? - No, in real life, you idiot. Wait, that's why you keep me as your assistant. You can't be you without me! It doesn't make any sense. No, it doesn't. - Wait--something is... - Off? - Yes. You're not your true self. - Who's not their true self? You're not? I'm not? No, you're not! Stop it! No, you stop it! - What? How did I get here? And where is here? Oh, downtown. - Shirley girly! - Uh, eww! Helpless girl-scream. Stop it! - Shirley girly. - Bad monster! No! - Hiro, no! You can't stop him alone! I'll help you! But first, I have to be my true self, my true self, my true self, - Shirley, Shirley. My true self - Shirley! Shirley-chan. - My true self. You have dream. - My true self, my true self. Wait, but it wasn't a dream. You were there, and Richard was there, and an ATM, and Tokyo too. - Tokyo? - Oh, wait. It was Cincinnati. - What is an ATM? - I have no idea. But Richard was attacking the city. Notzilla's not the monster, Richard is! And his blaster's going to destroy everyone in Cincinnati! Wait. You, you called me Shirley-chan. - Is nickname you give someone you have much feeling for. - Oh, I have much feeling for you too, Hiro. But first we have to save Notzilla and stop Richard! - But your career? - Oh, I'll worry about that in a sequel. But right now, I have to be my true self! - Yes, yes! But how? Beer has made his cells blew up. I tried to unify his cells and return him to his true size, to make formula for reverse beer. But so far I fail. I need catalyst. - Fusion! My theory for warm fusion! Fusion holds stars together. Did you know that? And people too. - Before I thought I have no power, but now I think I do! - Ooh! I very like this warm fusion! - Me too! - Cool. - Do you know what time it is? - You have to help me save the world! We have only one day left! - Ach! I have this book too! But I got stuck on the last chapter. - This is last chapter! - Well, it's about time! - This must be ready-- - By tomorrow! - Tomorrow? Without testing? Uff-da! There are 200 plutonium rods in that barrel. If they aim uncontrolled-- - A ooda ooda. Come on, Lars. - It's Bjorn. And I'm not from Sweden. - Hey, who is nominated for the Nobel War Prize, huh? - There's a Nobel War Prize? - I am missing "8 1/2 Samurai"! Why do we have to do this? - My heart broke when "Midwestern Hayride" went off. - So we can kill that beer-stealing iguana and introduce the world to my Uber-Fission power, that's why! Oh, yeah, and so you don't lose your jobs right before Christmas! - It's August. - Which is Christmas in Sweden! Right, Bjork? - We will build it, I promise, oh manly, stubble-faced leader! And it will be the best Uber-Fission Mega-Blaster ever! - Well, yeah, because it's the only-- - Oh, he'll never get past this field! There he is, sir. - Are you getting this, Kenny? - Like a match to celluloid. - Hmm. - You idiot! I told you to mine the field, mine the field! - Hiro? Richard. - It's me, Pearl. You're not gonna believe what I discovered about Blowfish. But I can't tell you on the phone because that would undercut the dramatic build-up. So get over to Gus's now! What's that? - A list of ways to kill Richard. - You're gonna like him even less when you hear this. I'm guessing you'll be looking for a job. As a woman nuclear physicist? - Oh, I understand. Me, I got a double glass ceiling. I'm a woman and I'm from New Jersey. - What can you tell me that I don't already loathe about Richard Blowheart? - Not much, since he died April 1st of 1945. - What? - In Liechtenstein, testing his Uber-Fission Mega-Blaster. The entire research center went wigi-wigi kabunga-schlacht! The only other survivor was Blowheart's chauffeur. Breathe, honey. - He's having the team build a Mega-Blaster! - Yeah, I know. - You know? - Yep, just like I know you're about to say-- - I have to stop them! And Hiro has to save Notzilla! - And I've gotta tell the world about it. - Bring up your rear! Now fall back! - This is it, men, I... Our last bastard of defense! - Bastion. - Last bastard of bastion. If the monster makes it into the city, we face impossible odds. One way streets, rush hour traffic. - Sir, the creature is approaching! - If we fail to stop him here, there'll be more bloodshed, and I, four-star General Dirk Bogus, simply will not allow that to happen! - Actually, sir, no one has died. It's almost as if the monster were just playing. - Not on my watch. Not on my watch! Is the grid ready? - Yes, sir! Just turned it on. 2,000 kilowatts, and no mimes in sight. He'll look like fried Goetta the second he touches that tower! There he is! Wait, where did that blimp come from? - Hmm. Whoa. - He likes it! Ha, I knew it! My team is finishing my Uber-Fission Mega-Blaster even as we speak. Ego... Ergo, I'm the one to end this massive bloodshed once and for all! - You and whose army? - There hasn't been any actual blood-- - Shut up! - Wait! Listen. - What, I don't hear anything. - That's just it! Hah! I always wanted to say that! - Ooh. Ooh! What's that, oh! Relax. It's just a cat. You want a cigarette? - Sure. Got a light? Oh oh oh! Thanks. Hey, Ann, come here. Take a look at this. - What is it, Marty? - Look, why do they always do that? They always get outta the car. - Ah, for no reason. - Yeah exactly and then they run. - And for no reason. Yeah, well, and then they fall down. - For no reason. - Exactly. Oh great, and then I fall down. And then, aye, up. There's the monster. And the monster always comes and picks 'em up. - Oh, no wait, Marty, look. That's a doll. - You're right, it is. No, no, wait, look, look close, is are. - Oh. - Yeah. Now I know how Fay Wray felt. You like it? It's called Eau de Terror. Oh, is that more beer? Great, more beer. He must be 160 feet tall by now. They grow up so fast. - Marty, go get some marshmallows. - Hey, no. Wait, bad dinosaur! Bad Notzilla! That's right. You heard me, didn't you? You did. Mama Notzilla says no. Yes she does. Little tiny Mama Notzilla says no! Now throw that thing away. You don't know where it's been! Like, oh, no, no! Wrong hand, wrong hand! - Huh? No. - The other hand, the other hand. That's right, honey. Oh, ooh. - Let's go, let's go, let's really go! Push him back, push him back, way back. - Where are the tanks? - Stuck in traffic. There he is! - Oh. - Wait, he's turning around. We're safe. - Wait. No! - It's not so much the fire I mind-- - It's where it comes from? - Exactly. - No, bad Notzilla, bad! Put the fire out, honey. - Oh. - Well, that's better. We can't let them hurt you, baby, so go to your room! Go to the hills. - Huh? - The hills. Only put Mama down first! Go, baby, go. Like I told General Dufus-- - Bogus. - He certainly is. All the bigwigs are busy. - Well, who's the biggest wig left? - Putting you through. This is General Specific. Holy moly, that is so great! - What? I haven't said anything yet. - I just read the subtitle. I'm sorry, how can I help you? - We have a situation here in Cincinnati. - I have tickets to the ballet. I will ask Dr. Blowheart to join me. - Huh, you'll never make it. - And why is that, Monsieur Gauche? - Because we got a ticket to the moon right there. - I'm leavin' for Houston at 5:23 p.m. - I'm flying to Stockholm, Sweden at 2:45. Just kidding. Minneapolis, don't you know. - Oh, now I know the world's gonna end. Bloch made a funny! - Oh, you of little faith! Our brilliant leader would not-- - Oh, yes he would! - What? The real Dr. Blowheart went kabunga-schlacht in 1945. Our Richard is the former child actor Donnie Draper, star of "The Dougie Dougwood, Boy Genius Serials". - But no, I love those! Donnie Draper is why I became a physicist. I swore one day I would marry him! - He's French. - Uh huh. - Oof da, I could tell Donnie Draper didn't understood a word he said. - And now Cincinnati's gonna go kabunga-schlacht if we don't keep this third-grade tether-ball champ away from that! - I always used to break that little rope where the little ball would angle from. Could never play it. - I don't believe it! Are you saying one of us is not what they claim to be? - Oh, for cute, how could we have missed it? - But our jobs. - Will be toast, yes. But, please, disarm the Blaster before... We have to stop letting him define us. We are not his personal geishas! - You had me until geisha. - Who put this crazy narcissist in charge? - Why they. - Oh I know. You'll say they did. But who is they? They is us. We are all to blame. - Right, thanks. This is what he does to people! This is Uber-Fission. A real leader doesn't push people apart. But he brings them together and empowers them. He helps them find their true selves! ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord ♪ ♪ Kumbaya ♪ Uh, I got bupkes. - What is this? - The formula for warm fusion. It incorporates all of your notes. - You took me? - What? - I filed the patent in your names. Line those tanks up. Keep those cards and letters coming in! General Bogus, sir! We're ready. The moment that monster shows up-- - No! We have to wait for, what's it called again? Magic hour! - We can't wait. It'll be disastrous. - It'll be gorgeous! - Where will my face look best? - I'd rather not say, sir. - All right, SNUGI's, pull the tarp off! Gorgeous! Now point it toward the city. - But the monster will be coming from-- - Drama, people! It's all about drama! Wind rustling hair, check. Sun glinting off of manly stubble, check. - You! Ignore him. - I'm in charge here. - I'm in control here! Without my tanks-- - Without my Blaster-- - The world faces certain-- - Dooky? - Poop? How did that get here? - Notzilla, sir! - Nonsense. There'd be a lot more of it if-- - No, Notzilla! Half a mile away. - Oh! - Initiate dramatic finale build-up! Well, so much for being accepted as a real scientist. Or saving Cincinnati. Where's Hiro? We can't do this without him. - Who wants chili? - I do! - Now or never, Uncle B! - Wait, men! Get back on camera, I mean back in strategic positions! - 50 years tops! I mean, it would be the City that Glows! General Bogus, Notzilla is coming! - My precious! - Ooh, I've been there. - Uh huh. - You're all fired! - Now we know what you meant by unlimited power, tuchas-breath! - You don't give beer to a lizard, Donnie! - But how did you know? - And I'm not Swedish, you imbecile. And I'm not white either! - Dr. Bloch, you're black? How could you! Oh, where's my... Oh, Shirley! At least I can count on my girl. - Woman. Scientist. Aww, I'm sorry. Is that inappropriate? Now, where's that little giggle I love? I love it when you do that. It's so you. Thank you. - It's our honor, Dr. Yujest. Notzilla is here! - Aww. - Oh, oh. How sweet! He brought me a bouquet of trees. Fire! Fire! - Go away, baby, no, go away! - Huh? - Yeah, no. Go on, baby. It's okay. - Huh? - No, it's okay. Go, go. It works? - Hi. - Hi! - Notzilla - Okay, baby. Mama Notzilla says it's okay. - Look! It is Padiddle time! - It's the right time. - It's here. - Right here, baby. Come on, baby. Okay, come on. - Notzilla. - Come on, baby. - Little kaiju come on. Butay? - You lied! I hate you, Richard! I love you, Donnie! Butay's a woman? - Well, now I feel better about looking at her-- - Uh huh. - Just look at you! How could anyone do science when you look like that? - Wait. Did you actually just say that? - Oui. - I love you! - I must possess you! - Okay. - You are an imbecile, but you are my imbecile! - She's French. - Uh huh. - I am sorry. You are a real scientist and a real woman. - As are you. And I understand why you did what you did. - And I am sorry I have to do this. Love makes one stupid, no? - Do what? - Only one plutonium rod is working, mon cher. But it is enough for you to kill the creature that has stolen your joy. - Stand back, everyone, or I will destroy you. For your own good, of course. I only wanna kill Notzilla. - I am Notzilla! - I am Notzilla! - I am Notzilla! - I am totally Notzilla, dude. ♪ Kumbaya, my Lord ♪ Fine.

Miss Stringer gave me the intel and the rest I've seen for myself. Dr. Blowfish is no longer fit to head SNUGI. Anyway his theories are bogus. - Sir, uh, ma'am! - Shut up. Can your rebuild the program using your warm fusion? The team says they'll only stay if you're in charge. - Yes, ma'am! Professor Honda? If you agree, I have been authorized to install you as head of the Pentagon's new Giant Monster Protection Program. - Woo hoo! - Yes, but protection from what? Sequels! - Do you have any regrets about adopting? - None whatsoever, darling. - Oh, sit up straight, honey. - Do what your mother says. - Mmm. - Funny how you look for happiness and one day it finds you. - Sit up straight, honey. - Now, sweetie pie, remember I used to be a really important person. - And you're happy too, my love? - Yes. I'm just glad that everyone is finally their true size. Me too. - Don't forget your toys, honey. - I've been waiting to ask how you feel about having more children.
