I think boxing is strong, stronger than I've ever seen it all over the world. Historically, boxing has always been a bit, the sport of immigrants. Ringside is the best place in the world to study human behavior. I believe that boxing of the past was a better boxing than today. There were many, many though fighters in every division in the world and they, you know, it was a different, there was a Bohemian life. They used to fight to win. Top Latino fighters of all time. Ooh. Roberto Duran. Jose Napoles. Wilfredo Vazquez. Johnny Ruiz. Bazooka Limon. Hugo Corro. Tito Trinidad. Kid Chocolate. Antonio, Kid Pambele, from Colombia. Aaron Oregano. Rafael Herrera. Well, Rafael Herrera, was in was an era where all the top 10 fighters were great, great fighters and all of them, I think, with the exception of two, maybe all of them went on to become world champions. My favorite fight of all time was between two fighters that had both been world champions. That was Mando Ramos, who had been the lightweight champion against Ultiminio Sugar Ramos, the Cuban living in Mexico. They fought 10 rounds of the, you've never seen it. At my home, I have pictures on the wall of when the final bell rang and they were holding each other up and on both eyes, both fighters were cut. It was the most brutal, brutal fight that I seen up to that time. And since that time. The thing is Ultiminio Sugar Ramos came here and I, maybe I shouldn't say this, Ultiminio, two guys that he knocked out, didn't wake up. And when he would box in the gym, he would be shorter than me, smaller. And when he would punch, the only one I've seen punched like that is Roberto Duran. And he was, we don't know him because time goes on and new, but Ultiminio Sugar Ramos was something else. Bobby Chacon, he was ungrateful. We used to get into some brawls, me and Bobby Chacon. My father gave him the nickname School Boy, as he nicknamed most of those fighters at that time, maybe he would come up with it in the dressing room or in the middle of the ring. And I know School Boy was one of them. Charismatic fighter, lovable, the smile, baby face and he had a story that, that was, you know, that people could not forget. And then he fought with all of his heart. Basically, the crowd is a Chacon crowd. There's that overhand right. Swinging away and he got "The Jet" with it again. I haven't seen in a long time. Alexis Arguello captured the imagination of American boxing fans. Oh, big right hand. And down goes Rooney. A tremendous straight right hand by Alexis Arguello. Rubbing Roonet right above our broadcast position. He will not get up. It is all over. A second round KO. First man over to see Kevin Rooney is Alexis Arguello. He is concerned about this young man who is... Frankie Benitez was another tough fighter. And to Kid Gavilan and onward, there have been outstanding fighters from South of the border or from North of the border, who had become the immigrants or children of immigrants in America. But now I think it's fair to say that Latinos dominate the sport. You have to call Roberto Duran number 1. Round seven. When I was fighting, I watched Duran on ABC Wild World of Sports. That was, for me it was everything. I watched Duran fight, it was the greatest fight I ever saw. To me, he's the most natural fighter I ever saw. He did things instinctively that nobody, he'd do things wrong, cause they would teach you one way he would do everything the opposite, but it worked out right for him. Oh. Roberto "Hands of Stone" Duran, the best, the best, no one comes near him. Duran was a freak, you know? At 135 pounds, he was the best fighter that I ever seen at 135. The moment is here. Roberto Duran challenging Sugar Ray Leonard. Last minute instructions from Angelo Dundee. Last minute instructions from Ray Arcel. We're ready. And round one of the long awaited, Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran, Welterweight Championship fight. I'm going to be very honest with you, Duran had it all. Duran had it all. What he was lacking was he would get frustrated if you made certain moves on him. So he's a typical Hispanic fighter. As long as you boxing and you're doing, stand right in front of me. He'll beat your behind. But, when you give him a little movement, you confuse him and he may want to quit on you. In the second fight, I totally outboxed Duran. I frustrated him with things with antics of sticking my chin out, bowling punching. I mean, things that I don't do in the gym, it was just spontaneous, just happened. And it took effect. It really, you know, like I pissed him off, if you will. And I think Duran threw his hands up through frustration. Both men can throw lethal bombs, too. It's been nonstop action. Good counter. Overhand right. Leonard gabbing by getting hit, too. Good little right hand by Duran that time. Knocks Sugar Ray in the ropes and gets away immediately. And what's happening? Duran says no. I think he's quitting. What is he saying, Larry? - He says no. - I don't understand. He's saying no. He quit. I don't understand this. I think Duran quit. I don't understand it. Julio Cesar Chavez helped usher in, I think, or solidify I'm going to say, Hispanic boxers as marquee champions, but I think we only need to look at Julio Cesar Chavez to see how difficult the journey is. He couldn't convince his own promoter, Don King, that he should be on top of cards for a long time. How many Tyson cards and other heavyweight cards did he labor as the second main event or third in some cases? Chavez is the greatest fighter in the history of Mexico. Let me tell you 38 World Championship bouts. Do you know who the second? Joe Louis. Here we go, round one. Chavez says I'm gonna give Haugen the beating of his life. He even went so far as to say that when Haugen returns to his hometown no one will recognize him. The thing that made Travis so great was the fact that he had the heart and not only the heart, but he had the balls in tenacity to win a fight. With all respect to Chavez, Olivares was fighting, and Chanez fought good fighters, Olivares fought great fighters. Ruben Olivares 88 wins. 77 of those were by knockout. Fernando Vargas was another great fighter. I consider myself a box, boxer-fighter. You know, I box intelligently. I get into 105 amateur fights, 105 defeats. You know, being number one in 132, 139, 147, , you have to be an intelligent boxer. So that's what I was looking to do in boxing and that's how I won my first world title, you know? Being with 76 wins, three losses, and 62 knockouts. I wouldn't have 14 fights. Nobody would give me a chance in the world to beat him and I boxed him and I was able to become the middleweight champion of the world. I think Vargas would have been, handled right, a bigger star in the Hispanic community, then Oscar, because something about Fernando was that he was more Hispanic than Oscar. Oscar was always a Hispanic who took on Anglo airs. I don't think you could say that about Vargas. And I think Vargas, because he was so colorful, could have really crossed over better than he did. The problem was that the people promoting Vargas weren't as astute as they could be. Salvador Sanchez, oh, I love watching him performing. He was such a thing of, a technician's a thing of beauty. Probably the best of all time. Unfortunately, he died in Iraq when he was 22. Round 13, live on the CBS Sports spectacular from Phoenix, Arizona and the challenger comes out swinging. Sanchez comes back with another right hand right on the chin. Another good job in the Lopez corner as he comes out with his cuts looking pretty good here. Sanchez, of course, will be banging away at them throughout this round. And Salvador Sanchez's full career didn't unfold, I mean, he had the great fights with Azumah Nelson and Wilfred Benitez and made himself a superstar in his early twenties and then the unfortunate road accident that took his life. So we didn't get to see him develop. In two years, we will have no more heroes of the past. So we are in a rush to find new hero, new idols, because without idols boxing is no good. Well, my name is Hannah Gabriels. I'm from Costa Rica, and I'm a professional boxer. I'm the WBO Champion World Champion for 154 pounds. I come from the South Bronx. I was born and raised in East L.A. I was born in the canal zone in the suburbs of Panama. I was a young kid fighting in the projects, East Los Angeles. We're finding the projects in the ghettos of Boyle Heights. I was 10 years old, locked up in juvenile hall, six batteries, out doing community service. I was already going nowhere quickly but because one day, when I was suspended from school, that's where I know God had the remote in my hand, and I was flipping through the channels. And I saw amateur boxing. I saw kids my age. I was 10 years old at that time, eight year olds that were fighting on TV on Jones' inner cable, it was Ring Set Boxing Challenge. What is this? And once they said, La Corona Boxing Club, I want it. I could do that. I knew I could do that. I had a choice, either learn how to box or get my ass kicked in the streets abroad, in New York. As we know, poverty creates those opportunities for these young men to make it, to make a life and to become a star, make some money. I mean, that happened in on par with the world in boxing. You know, where you have these, a lot of poor people and where you have a lot of hungry people, you're gonna find fighters there. The fact that boxing is a poor man's sport, without question, and to be a great boxer I think one of the greatest components is the fact of poverty, because we have nothing, because we want to be somebody and you don't see a guy, a kid from Beverly Hills becoming a successful boxer. I'm a physician. My son is also a physician, practices with me. My daughter is a chiropractor. When they were of boxing age, when they were kids, we belonged to the club. So my kids, afterschool or whatever, would go to the club where they played tennis or golf, things like that. Well, these kids, these Latin kids, they don't belong to the club. So they actually have three places they can go. Number one, they can go to the parks, probably the most dangerous place to be in these days. Number two, they can go to the gym. Number three, they can go into the gangs. Of those three things, the gym becomes the most desirable, but when they go to the gym, they aren't offered tennis and golf. They're offered boxing and kickboxing. You as a rich man, you don't have to work for a damn thing, but you as a poor man know that, oh, here's a sport that I can become rich at. So therefore you go out, you make your first pay day, and here's the guy never had a dime in his life. All of a sudden, he fights. I don't care if it's no more than $500. Oh, 500 bucks? To him, it's like being rich. So he continued to fight and the purse go up and up and up and up. So he becomes hungry and long as he stayed hungry, he's are going to become a very, very rich man. He gonna continue to make money, but in order to make that money, he know that he has to work harder than everybody else in order to get there. That's what happens with fighters. Boxers are born. They are born to fight. They have society enrage them. They don't have money to eat. Their life, when they are children, is the world that could be a lie. I went to school one day, got home from school and my mom was just gone. The same with my dad. He didn't show up for like another year. When I was four years old, I used to have a lot of problems, family problems, I went twice into foster homes. There's still a lot of dysfunction in me, even though I've overcome a lot in my life. There's still like the little girl in me that, you know, that grew up an alcoholic and with an alcoholic father and in poverty and so there's still that me, that is inside, which enables me to love boxing. Well, I found boxing because my family was poor. Big, big family. We're so poor, you know, we didn't have money to eat. And then it made me feel so bad to see my mother and father go without eating a meal so we could have food to eat, you know, and that was so, so bad. We didn't have enough food for everybody. And it made me, so I don't know how to read or write. No school, but I had to do something to help my family and, you know, it's terrible. There's nothing more important than having a hungry fighter. Exactly, you know? Before, before I became a champion, that's what happened to me, you know, I'll confess to that, I was hungry. I was determined. A lot of these guys do it out of necessity, you know? Because they are so poor, they do it out of necessity. So it goes the old saying you gotta be hungry to be a champion. And that's a common thread in most boxing stories. And I mean, not in America, but in worldwide, boxing, is a resort for young men to not only stand out, but to make a career and have financial security and get out of the barrio, get out of the slums. When you know, this is a story that has happened, you know, with Jewish fighters, Italian American fighters, African and African-American fighters. Fighting was a way for me to, where I could get respect, where people would notice me. To be a fighter, you have be, you know, very tenacious. You have to know how difficult life can really be. And I think Marvin Hagler said it perfectly when he, when he explained how difficult it was to do roadwork at four in the morning when he was sleeping between silk sheets. So, boxers are not made. Boxers are born. The center for boxing in the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, into the nineties was in the East. And that idea that you don't put two Hispanics together and certainly Mexican fighters have no value, prevailed in the East. And the East was the center of boxing. Well, boxing to me is, was the ultimate example of the famous poster that shows New York covering most of the world, New Jersey covering another third of the world, and then the rest of the world is this tiny little area in terms of both importance. This is the New Yorker's view of the world. That was the way boxing operated in the United States. The East coast was all important. But Aileen Eaton, in California, always had Mexican nationals, Mexican Americans, fighting in the old Olympic Auditorium. And she did very well, as did George Parnassus. So out in California, it was a business then promoting Hispanic fighters. At Olympic auditorium in Los Angeles a turn away crowd of over 10,000, packed their way into the fight arena for a glimpse of the Art Aragon-Chuck Davey welterweight match, and it promised to be a close one. Most boys display a determined anxiety. Aragon is definitely bothered by Davey's southpaw style and is having difficulty in trying to set Davey up for that one big punch. But California wasn't as big and as important as it has become in the 21st century and in the 1990s. And, I would say it's fair to say that boxing has shifted from the East to the West and the Southwest. So that places like Texas and Nevada and California are now the most important areas for boxing and because of the large Hispanic populations, particularly Mexican and Mexican Americans, living in those places, Hispanic boxers have risen to the fore. It's hard for me to say, and I couldn't quantify it, that the Hispanic boxes are now better now than they used to be. There's just more opportunity for them. Because there used to be one place, the Olympic, where they all came to and they fought. And from that point on, they finally know everywhere else else in the world. But the Mecca was right there. We talk about Madison square garden. Obviously they had their time, but if you talk about the West coast and the Latino fighters, there's no better place than the Olympic. The Olympic was like the Madison Square Garden of the West, and we weren't letting the fighters go back there. Well, we had good drawing cards. I mean, we fought hard to keep them and they did the same thing. Oh, the Garden, they would send me opponents. I would send them opponents, but the cream of the crop, no, you wouldn't. Don promoted boxing in Northern California for a whole bunch of years. And then Aileen Eaton asked Don and his wife, Lorraine, who's also in the boxing business, to move down to Los Angeles so he could be the matchmaker at, you know, the Olympic Auditorium. And he was the matchmaker there for 19 years. And that's why the television commentator on that weekly television show, Jim Healy, gave him the name of War-a-Week Chargin because there were Wars every week in that Olympic ring. I mean, if the main event wasn't that great, the preliminaries made up for it, you know? As a kid, growing up in L.A. and going to the Olympic regularly, watching it on TV, I don't think I had the wider perspective to say, "Hey, look at these fighters, you know, taking on all this." All I knew was, when I went there, it was the most exciting thing I could ever go to. You could feel the tension in that room in a big fight. And it changed in a big fight versus a small fight. And as a kid, I noticed it, there was a buzz in the air when there was a big fight. Chargin would make good matches. Don Frazier would make good matches, competitive matches. This is what you don't see today. You see one guy with an unbeaten record, 30 and 0, 28 knockouts, fighting a guy with a record of 14 and 10, you know, with a soft chin, you know, and they would put together exciting fights. That's why there were successful. People from the East, they didn't know what a Mexican was. They used to always refer to them, you got a lot of those Spanish fighters out there, but they really didn't know what a Mexican fighter was. We had a Mondo Ramos, lightweight champion, Raul Rojas, featherweight champion, Carlos Palomino, welterweight champion. I mean, these were, these were all good, good fighters. Jimmy Lennon, who was the ring announcer, probably the best ever in history, calls me up into the ring and as I'm walking up, he's introduced to me and he was like, "The new welterweight champion of the world is King Carlos Palomino." King? Where did that come from, you know? And I go, I thank him, you know? And then afterwards I go, "Well, what was that? That's embarrassing to me, King Carlos." He goes, "Just yesterday. I was reading the paper. It said King Carlos, King Juan Carlos of Spain dies." So that's where I got it from. So I, you know, I, I was, it was a glorious night at the Olympic. It was loud. One of the loudest places to this day I've ever been to, all of the cement walls and so forth. The noise of the crowd just reverberated right back at you and made it even louder. And I just couldn't believe the volume of the audience when I was there. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable fans, they knew what they were watching. They knew what they were doing, and they'd let the boxers know, they'd let the referee know. They let the announcer know, what they thought of the decision and so they're actively involved. As boxing matriculated West and became more important then, of course, Hispanic boxing on the West coast became, you know, just a wonderful part of the sport to this day. To right now, there is still a feeling among many people in boxing that if you don't fight ever in New York or the East coast, somehow you don't matter. Now that has been greatly abated because Las Vegas has become obviously a big fight capitol of the world and people finally kind of understand that, you know, California is part of the United States and it may be in a different time zone, but it counts. When Aileen Eaton had the Olympic, people don't realize she had weekly television shows and look at the crowds we had, but what she used to do every couple of weeks, she would have me, we would get one of our stars and he would be off TV, but a whole show would be on TV and people would sit at home and they'd see 10,000 people there. They, but people crazy, we got to get down there. We had it so that if you missed, if you missed a Thursday night fight and lost your seats, that was it. But she used to let them miss twice. And if they didn't come up with a real, real good excuse, they would go back and somebody would move up. And that's the way she ran it. We're talking about Latino boxers, but in no way can we ignore the fact that it was a multicultural scene there at the Olympic auditorium and so you'd see fighters of all race and color and national backgrounds come together, fight, spar, and train at the Main Street Gym, you know, and also you put it on together in the ring, but it was a great place where they had great grade fights. I fought at the Olympic Auditorium, but my era, it was already on it's way out when I came in. But when Bobby Chacon and Danny Lopez, and Albert Sandovall and Carlos Palomino, Mondo Muniez, Randy Shields, Tuti Pineda, all these guys, Jose Luis Martin Del Campo, I mean, we had that year "Shotgun" Alverado, we had everybody could fight in every division. Well, I grew up at the Olympic Auditorium as a boxing fan. I grew up at the Forum as an announcer. That's some of the earliest places I announced regular fights, Monday nights at the forum. And there again, we saw bringing in fighters from South of the border and from other countries. And we saw a great resurgence in boxing as John Jackson and Jerry Buss put together a program, which would, which had some great, great fighters from Latin America. Yeah, Los Angeles became the Forum, especially, became the, the center of all the great Mexicans of all time. Definitely, Ruben Olivares, Carlos Zarate, Raul Macias, every great Mexican was a Los Angeles fighter, California fighter. One of the things that Forum Boxing did is because of our involvement with Prime Ticket, we were able to broadcast and televise fights that were televised around the country and involved a lot of Latino fighters. At the Olympic, they brought in a lot of fighters from Mexico that had been well-known. So by the time they hit LA, they were known. At the Forum, conversely, especially during the Jerry Buss years, the long great run, he had, a lot of Mexican fighters made a name for themselves in LA, before they were well-known in Mexico. It's guys like, you know, Marco Antonio Barrera, for sure. He came here, there was a little 108 pound fighter, Humberto Chiquita Gonzalez, for sure, became more popular once they came LA. And I think that Prime Ticket and Jerry Buss have to take credit for spreading that around the country, as it happened and promoters like Bob and Don Chargin and Darren Frazier got involved in promoting Latino fighters. They didn't get a lot of television, as much television exposure for boxing because obviously Jerry Buss owned half of Prime Ticket. And so Forum Boxing became a regular programming item for Prime Ticket and I was involved with Prime Ticket. And obviously I was going to make sure that we promoted and televised boxing. I believe that the New York and the Madison Square Garden, our history, no one can come close to them. Some of the greatest fights in the history of boxing were held in New York in the, in the Madison Square Garden, some great at the Yankee Stadium, but second to none to me is Los Angeles. Second to none. To a large extent, American boxing has become Latino American boxing and the most, right now, the most loyal boxing fans, the most fervent boxing fans are Latino fans. 100% Latinos drive the boxing market. You know, it's not even a question. Mexican fight fans, even just anywhere, I mean, Latinos drive the Mexican, I mean the boxing market, you know, they're passionate, loyal about boxing, you know? Hispanic boxing fan is a real bedrock of our business and Hispanic fighters are more numerous than ever. And there are so many more outlets for Hispanic fighters. We do a three times a month series for Fox en Espanol. There's a Telemundo, Univision. So there are a lot of avenues open to Hispanics. And indeed it's a big advantage today to be Hispanic because of that. Puerto Rico has very good basketball players, very good baseball players, but boxers are Puerto Ricans. Every second in the ring, they wear their flag on their trunks, their pride on their sleeve. So it's very, very important. It's front page news, every time a local fighter goes to the big stage and either win or lose, you know, it's, it's one of the main stories in Puerto Rico every day in and out. The difference in America and in these foreign countries that are bringing these fighters and bringing them up is these guys carry the weight of the country on their shoulders. When, excuse me, when Julio Cesar Chavez fought, the whole Island stopped. Now you have Manny Pacquiao, where the whole Philippines they're watching his fight. They, they maybe have 75, 80% of their population are watching. And we've never had an American like that, maybe, since when Joe Lewis fought. It's a flag thing. You gotta knock him out because, and don't, and you know, one thing that's great about it, those guys, you got to kill him in the ring because those guys are going to die for that flag. Latinos loved the sport so much that, you know it's interesting to present a card to them, to put a show for them, because if a fight stinks, they'll let you know right away, you know? They're not the kind of people that will throw money into the ring. If they're not throwing punches in the middle of the round, a lot of them will walk away. You can't fool the fight fan. And especially the Mexican fight fan. I mean, just forget it. There's no way you're going to fool them. I mean, you can go out and you can show them sheets of publicity on this, but they're going to make up, they're going to make up their own mind. When Davey Moore fought in the Garden against Roberto Duran, years and years ago, Davey Moore was a dyed in the wool New Yorker. He had lived in New York his whole life. He'd become a champion in New York. He was proud of his city. Here he was fighting in New York, Madison square Garden, a packed crowd, almost everybody in that arena was rooting for Roberto Duran. Now, clearly there was a large Panamanian and Hispanic group there, but even some that weren't were rooting for Roberto Duran. But a lot of it was ethnic and Davey Moore until he finally passed away and he committed suicide, never could understand how his, and it actually affected him dramatically that night, that along with some of the questionable tactics by Roberto, it had a dramatic effect on him. He didn't understand it. It was like hard to fathom. You gotta realize, if I'm the only Latino in the entire division, you know what I mean? I'm just hoping that they stick, stay by stick behind me. I mean, and move me on, you know, me, cause I, I'm not only representing Puerto Rico, I'm resident representing the whole Latino world and I'm hoping I'm doing a good job at it. You know what I mean? It's a tough task to take on, you know, especially when a lot of Latino, so proud of their, of the, the boxing of their sport and for me to just go out there and not do right by them, then they just, you know, so not only embarrassing to me, but I feel like it's an embarrassing to them, too. And now you're one Mexican national against the Puerto Rican national. And you know, you feel good because you have the people from your country that are there cheering you on and you want don't put them down. You don't want to, you know, yeah, you know, put them down, you want to make sure that you win. So you do everything that you can, you want your people to be proud of you. And at the same time that pushes you and encourages you to fight on harder too, because also it's a bigger responsibility. You know, when you see the flag, when you see all these people cheering for you, it's just a bit bigger pressure. On this interview, I don't know if I could have said the word poache because I knew what it was by going to the Olympic Auditorium and these Mexican Americans, who basically supposedly lost their culture, okay? Couldn't speak fluid Spanish, were the guys that were brought in at the Olympic to be the heroes, but the Mexicans, straight Mexicans, they would be the fan favorites. Even though these fighters would be built up, the guys straight from Mexico would always be, get the crowd, get the crowd. And my heroes would have to, I was for the poches. I liked the poches, but I had to respect the Mexican-American, the Mexican-Mexicans, the true Mexican, because the crowd was going crazy. Well, you know, poacho means poached egg. And I wasn't aware of that. It's because he was not born in Mexico. So, so some of the Mexican nationals or people who were born in Mexico and then immigrated, if you weren't born in Mexico, they call you a poached egg because you're not a fried egg and you're not a scrambled egg, you're a poached egg. A poacho is like, how can I say it? Like a bootleg. He's a bootleg Mexican. That's basically what they're calling him. He's not a real Mexican, you know, he's a second hand Mexican. You know, I never been called that. I'm a you know, you put me in Mexico and I'm good. Poacho? You're an American, you're a white boy. And what, and we're not, you know? I go to Mexico or when I used to go to Mexico, I'm el gringo. You know, here comes the white boy. I don't know how my dad is Mexican. My mother was, you know, Mexican-American and you know, I'm Mexican. I come over here, same thing, "Oh, here comes the Mexican". Over there, I'm the gringo. And over here, I'm the Mexican. So, you know, we're, we're not allowed either way, you know? It's funny, you could be from L.A. and you're going to fight an out of towner from Mexico. But the place is filled mostly with Mexican nationals. And man, they booed me. All though the fight it was, "Mexico, Mexico." They booed me. I was getting pissed off. I was really getting mad, you know? During the "Mexico, Mexico" part of this, you know, I'll show them. So, I'm Chicano, you know? On of my, I don't know if fondest memories, but interesting memory is about a paocho Frankie Duarte, fighting at the Olympic Auditorium with a guy named Tarcisio Gomez, okay? Duarte was up and coming, Gomez had beaten him, okay? The rematch, Frankie Duarte was fighting Gomez again. The fans are, of course, this is a Mexican with a mediocre record, 17 and 13 and Duarte at the time, you know, it was, it was maybe one loss or something like that. And they were rooting for this Mexican, this Gomez. Duarte got the decision. The fans did not like it. The fans went crazy, started tearing up seats. The winner Frankie Eduardo Duarte and I hear a bang, a bottle from up there hit me in the head. And they were booing. They had a riot. I mean, a full scale riot. In boxing, everyone knows what's going on. And they know everyone has their own opinion of what the other person should be doing. You know, everybody thinks that they should be working in the corner and be like, "Oh, this is coach sucks. Let me work the corner." Every boxing fan thinks that they are, which is cool. You know, which is very good because boxing is a sport that will never die. Ever. You know, in boxing records mean very little. Styles is the meaning, is the name of the game. When you step into the ring with a Latin fighter, specifically a Mexican fighter, it's going to be a fight all day long. You're going to have to beat him. You're going to punch him, out think him, but you're going have a heavy. Puerto Rican's got better boxing skills but Spanish guys got bigger heart. He got bigger heart. They wouldn't die. The old Mexican national fighters, not so much today. Now they're getting to be a little more of a stylist kind of boxing kind of thing, where before, and I'm saying like back, going back in the forties and fifties and sixties, they would just come in and throw in their hook to the liver. That liver shot. That's a big thing. As you know, a guy by the name of Julio Cesar Chavez or everybody, there's guys like Ruben Olivares, and a lot of old time fighters, they all talk about that shot. Well, the Mexican fighter's tough. He's tough. He's not going to quit. He's going to stay there. He's going to throw millions of punches, you know? We're brawlers, you know? We're more brawlers. It's like, it's more, it's not a degree. Like I said, you're born with it. You know, I had a good chin, you know, I had a strong chin and they kill the fighter, killed the fighter when, you know, when he hits you with his hardest punch and you're right there, right in front of them and say, hello, hi, it's me again. You know, very strong chin. Majority of them have very strong chin, you know? So a Mexican fighter, they, you know, even when I was fighting, I didn't want to really fight a Mexican fighter because I know I'm going to have to fight hard. The Mexican definitive, they are fighters. They never learned how to jab. The Latinos always were dominant in the sport of boxing, amateur, and professional. And I recall vividly competing against guys from Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela. These guys were tough and they all seemed to be a little more experienced than we were. Argentinians develops boxing the way the English people used to do. And their first time of the very, very well punctuated on defense style, hit and don't get hit. When you get to the Caribbean, Dominican and Bodiquas and the Cuban fans that emigrated here, you know, they're known for their slickness. I mean, tough guys, always all them have a lot of heart, but where Mexicans are kind of come forward a lot less movement., the Caribbean fighters get a lot of movement, real slick, but a lot of time, you know, we call it the Panamanian. Where they get on the ropes and bounce off the ropes and like this, trying to cut around and move away. I see these guys in here look great. It looks great. It score no points, but it looks great. The Puerto Ricans, there's no way that you can, I've run a Puerto Rican in the ring, these guys have leg movement, like, I mean, they're dancers. They say, if you could, you know, in the ring you can move, you could be, if you're a good dancer, you'd be a good fighter. Most of the Latin fighters that move real well, are great salsa dancers, great salsa dancers, you would be amazing to find out. Guys on Puerto Rico that teach boxing punches. It's not robotic where a guy stays in, want to bang, bang, bang. So when you tell, tell them about a Puerto Rican fighters, most of the guys going to have a good right hand, good left hook, and they're going to mix their punches up. Whereas a lot of Mexicans, they just look for left hook and the knee tor the body, but I do have to give them credit for keeping their hands high. They do keep their hands very high. So whenever you have a boxing match between a Puerto Rican and a Mexican, it's going to be war. Or Puerto Rican, and anybody's going to be war because we are boxing. Well, the Puerto Rican fighters, they were more aggressive, the American, the Argentinian fighters but there were also there they have techniques to fight, avoiding it, punch it like, a great master, Benitez, he was a great defensive fighter. Puerto Rican fighter. Yeah, they are tough. You know, they're tough, but they have the boxing techniques. They are more of a boxers, you know, but they have a punch. They are boxers that can punch and punchers that can box. You know, very smart when they get to the top, they get there because they are great fighters. Yeah, the techniques. You know, everybody has their own technique. Every fighter, every Chicano, you know, they got their own little techniques. Mexican-American fighters, you know, are very, very strong, you know, but at that time they don't last as long as the Mexicans from Mexico. Our boxers were at Mexican, you know, the heart of the Mexicans and he'd come in the entrance and dig that body, bring the hook over the top, you know, and somebody was going to go down and something exciting was going to happen. I kind of know how to do it. I just don't know how to give up. Whether there's a breath in my body, I'm going to try to get up or die trying. A Mexican fighter is willing to die in the ring. It's that, you know, important to them to get the W. How are you doing, Jacob? Are you all right? After the state commission doctor asked Corrales how he was doing and if he wanted to keep fighting. This is the last time. I'm not going to let you come out, if you don't throw punches. I'm going to stop the fight myself. We have already stopped the fight. You fight or we stop the fight, okay? You got it? Over and over and over again, fighters that suffered traumatic brain injury, the dad would be in the corner. Jimmy Garcia from Columbia died in a fight with Gabriel Ruelas. Who was in the corner? His father. Johnny Owen, from England, from Great Britain, died after fighting Lupe Pintor. Who was in the corner? His father. Whenever the father is in the corner, something does not go right because the father wanted him to go and not lose, go and give everything that they have for victory. The Hispanic market in the United States has become so powerful in many ways, powerful as an economic force, soon to be powerful, I think politically as well, and in the world of sports, especially boxing, it is huge. All these big companies want to reach the Hispanic market. Just like so many companies are crazy about the demographic, the male demographic, 18 to 35, whatever it is. Now, more and more companies will say, we need something to get to the Hispanic audience, right? We can advertise on Univision. We can advertise on Fox en Espanol. We can advertise on Telemundo, but we'd like to advertise generally and yet be able to reach that Hispanic audience and boxing enables them to do it. The sport really got hurt when they took the free TV away. The Saturday afternoon fights on ABC, the Friday night fights, and the Gillette commercials, and the Pabst Blue Ribbon, all those kinds of things. You really got to know the fighters and you want to see them. There have been many, many fights that the television has not been interested and they have great fights, really. And I believe that there's is a business. When you go back to like 1974, for instance, I'm going to pick out one big fight that everybody will know about, the Ali-Foreman fight, Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire. That was the first time. And you've got to remember that. It was only shortly before that in the sixties, that all these satellites came in as part of the space program. And it had a big effect on the communication business and, i.e. television and international television and the ability to broadcast live events from either Europe or in this case, Africa, it was the first time that all four and that's all they had at that time, satellites, were used simultaneously for that fight and that telecast actually went to a billion people, live. But that's a big part of the business, getting the rights to show it in, whether it be Puerto Rico or the Philippines. That's part of the negotiations. The Latino community drives the sport in a sense. I don't know the specific numbers of this statistic or whatever, but I'm pretty sure that they're a huge driving force in the pay-per-view numbers, obviously in the ticket sales. I see it on our shows. We have 95% Latinos in attendance all the time. It doesn't matter if it's an African-American fighter or if it's a Mexican fighter. They just like to go to the fights. I believe that HBO is without a question, one of the greatest things ever to happen to the sport of boxing, but also they believe that they own boxing. They believe that it's them who can decide who is fighting who, when, and for how much money. The best places to watch fighters get nurtured toward prime time is on Spanish television, which has quite a bit of boxing. ESPN has some. HBO and Showtime show some young fighters. I think I figured out that there were roughly three or four live, an average of three or four live events on television a week across the year. I think that boxing aficionados and the people that like the sport and revere it will have a place in our heart for things like the trilogy between Israel Vasquez and Rafael Marquez. If those fights, however, had been held in the eighties on free TV, and if the Marco Antonio Barrera-Erik Morales trilogy had been held on Wide World of Sports, they would be forever icons. They would be on a pedestal that we could hardly imagine. That's how good those six fights really are. When they interfere in being a barrier for a good boxer who has the merit to fight for the title, because he's not America or because they don't like him, or because he belongs to some manager that they don't care or promoter that they don't care. And that we cannot accept. I hope that someday HBO and the institution, and in my case, the WBC could sit down and make each other understand the needs because we need HBO. Boxing need HBO, but HBO need us. And it's so much different now because nowadays you have five titles, alphabet titles, back in our days, WBC, WBA. It's so different now because, who's the heavyweight champ? Who's the light heavyweight champion? Who's the middleweight champion of the world? They're here today. They're gone tomorrow. Bringing the fights to border towns is very important and letting the fans get to see them. And this was part of the economy too. You have to have the right prices at these fights. But I think if you go to Tijuana or Nogales or certainly Juarez, they have some great fights there. They only want the charismatic fighters that are fighting somebody else that is also very well-known, but we cannot do that in boxing. The great clashes in boxing come from building up local fighters to fight each other. Back in the days at the Olympic, when it was in his heyday, absolutely it made the fighters better and you really needed to, if you wanted to fight the next next month, you better do good, but it was a different time, the entertainment dollar wasn't as stretched. You had a lot less television in those days. And it was an event to something like a weekly time, "Hey, every Friday night I'm going to the Olympic or every Wednesday night", whatever that would be and those days are gone, obviously. The main change in boxing has been, there've been a series of fluctuations in the 30 years I've been involved in boxing. It's really in three segments. The first segment was the 1980s, which was a great decade for boxing on every level, both in terms of the fights that were club fights and the fights on a moderate level, all the way up to the major fights that included great, great fighters. The 1990s were an abyss for boxing because the big fights weren't great and that's when some of the activity, even on the moderate levels started to go south. Then starting in the year 2000 or a little bit after, boxing improved its product dramatically, whether it was just by osmosis or I don't know, because nobody gets together and decides things in boxing, the product got better and not only did the upper echelon fights get better, but boxing at a lower level branched out because of different casinos and other things and boxing became again, a little bit more of what it was in the 1980s. Golden boy promotions to me is like a corporation. It's very white-collar. The problem is, and I know a lot of these people and I like them. There's no boxing people there. There are people that are friends of Oscar, and there are CEO's that were brought aboard and there's a Swiss banker. Top Rank, you're going to a boxing company from Bruce Trampler on down, you are in the presence of people that have been part of the boxing history and have made boxing history. Hometown victories are common knowledge in the game. So a road warrior, might go into a town and the promoter will say, "Okay, I'll put you up in a hotel." Then the promoter will make sure, if the promoter wants his house fighter to win, you know, he'll make sure that your room is next to the nightclub so you don't sleep all night and things like that, all these little details work on you, you know, to the point where it's on, you know, two, three days later, you're ready for the fight you're frazzled. So, fighters are very fragile. So, and people play head games with them, not just promoters, you know, not just managers, but even fans who are bets, gamblers, you know, they'll come and they'll tell them, says, you know, that promoter, you know, did he pay you already? You know, he's not gonna pay you, you know? And then you're more worried about getting paid than the fight. Boxing is the most corrupt sport in the world. And that's my, that's my sport. You know, Bob said that God made a mistake because in the year 1931, Don King were born. King and his ability to be a promoter was able to realize when Tyson was away and out of the sport, after all the enthusiasm because, at one time, King controlled all the heavyweights and when the the excitement of Tyson was done, all of a sudden he brings Chavez on. And Julio Cesar Chavez kept boxing alive for the three years that Mike Tyson was in prison. So, I mean, King was a very sharp guy in realizing what Latino fighters meant over the years. Don is a great promoter. He's not an okay promoter. He's a great promoter. He could walk in and promote any fight you named. It had nothing to do with the abilities of the fighters. He just was a great promoter and is a great promoter. Don to me is now the lion in the winter. Don is fading away and once Don dies, so does DKP and that's unfortunate. Bob Arum has set up a legacy through Todd duBoef and where he has a real infrastructure of people that even when he dies, Top Rank will be a presence on the boxing scene for the next 50 years and they will continue to develop champions. They will continue to make events, and they will continue to be a major influence on boxing. I would eliminate the alphabet soups and bring it all under one lineal champion. And unless that champion gets beat, you know, that champion stays champion. Boxing now is an internet driven sport. And toward that end, it's more international and that part's good, but it still isn't, that relegates it a little bit to a more of a niche sport. If ABC or NBC or CBS or Fox would do a, even every two week fight and having the right fighters fight each other, I think it would reinvigorate the sport. The fan base of the sport, you can see that there's a different age. You know, the older kind of guy, let's say an average fan will go more for boxing. The younger generation is more, it's going more towards MMA. You know, it may be going through a different time in the United States, but boxing in a worldwide scene is as healthy as it's ever been. Everybody knows that Cuban boxers are good, everybody. If you are in England and Germany, whatever they say, "Oh, the Cubans are good." You have to understand, Cuba has perhaps the richest boxing history in the Americas before the Cold War. I mean, Jack Johnson lost his title in Cuba. So it was a big boxing venue at the beginning of the 20th century. You say, fighters and fighters like Kid Gavilan, fighters like Kid Chocolate, world champions in the, before the, during the Second World War. And then during the golden age of boxing, I mean, you're talking about Gavilan who fought and Sugar Ray Robinson, you know, had great fighters and he's totally, you know, toe-to-toe with the all time greats from the U.S. Well, I mean, Cuba, you got, you know, 200, 300 amateur fights. I mean, you're taught how to fight every type of distance, you know, on the outside, the middle, the inside, and when you, you know, when you're fighting Russians and you're fighting Czechoslovakians in their backyard, you learn how to fight real, you know, real quick, and, you know, in somebody else's backyard you don't get nervous for fights, and to them it just comes like, you know, drinking water. Then the Cold War came and it sort of put Cuba in a bubble, froze that that time forever, some fighters escaped like Jose Annapolis, who went on to a very successful career as a welterweight champion in Mexico. Yet the political situation affected incredibly the boxing situation in Cuba. They are professional amateurs. They are very good at what they do. And I don't think there's two sports that are supposedly similar that could be more unlike each other than amateur to pro boxing. It's a different game. It's a different mindset. It's a different philosophy. And what the Cubans do as amateurs, fighting against the computer and running out the clock, is not really going to translate well into being a professional fighter. As time has gone by and they have started with this silly thing that, you know, you're pressing these buttons and if the two guys don't press the button at the same time, then even if the blow lands, you don't get counted. And with the politics that, you know, get Cuban coaches, Chinese coaches, these guys favor these guys, and these guys favor the guys from the other block and these guys, and so on, Olympic boxing, not just Cuban, all Olympic boxing has turned into fencing. I know that the Cuban fighters that we have have all defected from Cuba, and they are extremely well-schooled and they tended to be very boring fighters. All left-handers, who won their medals because they fought at a weight that was lower than the weight they should have been at and they were big and they, but they were well schooled. Back in the day, if there were no, they would've been pro already at 18 years old, 20 years old. Right now, when you fight with a Cuban, you're fighting with a man. They don't turn professional at a relatively young age. I think that adjustment is really a difficult one, but I also think the biggest one is from a standpoint of adjusting to our society. And I think the worst thing that happens to Cuban fighters is that they come to our country, they walk into a supermarket and they see a lot of food on the aisles and the open up the refrigerators, and it's no longer just a banana and a glass of water. They're 20 pounds heavier overnight. Why is he not in shape, when it's most important moment of his life? He's just signed a contract with the top promoter in the world. Why is this person not in condition? I think there's too much drama, you know? So if you take that away and it's just the fighting that they're doing in the ring, which is, it never is for Cubans, you know, the least fighting that they're doing is in the ring. You know, I think these guys would do incredible. I mean, you look at the specimen that come out of Cuba. I mean, nobody can touch them. I think when they come over here and they turn pro, they face a whole new system in every level, then they're not going to be fighting in tournaments they're not going to be fighting constantly. You might fight four times a year, five times a year, six times a year, a lot is six times a year. Now they're going to have to get used to going distances. When you have gone 200 times three rounds and they tell you you're going to go eight, even if you got like all the wind in the world, even if you could really go 20, psychologically, you're going, "Ooh, eight." That system killed the sport. They don't want professional sport. They want you to be there and, you know, you got to win medals, but you know, what about your stomach? They killed the sport. But I remember Kid Chocolate was great. He was one of, "Mantequilla" Napoles. Great fighters, but you know, we have to wait what will happen in Cuba and then we'll have the Cuban fighter. Teoflio Stevenson, he would have done well in the early, early stages of boxing. I do know for sure if he had met a guy like an Ali, I know without any doubt he would have been beaten. Ali was just too quick for him, too smart. Dude, I was in Cuba after that Teoflio Stevenson and Mohammed Ali and when he has Duran, and give me your opinion, you know, "Stevenson fighting Mohammad Ali, who would win?" because Fidel was waiting and Duran said, "Oh, Stevenson gonna knock him out." He say, "No," you know, in Spanish he say Duran, he sounds style, Fidel changed the conversation and never ever asked Duran again about Stevenson and Muhammad Ali. There's actually been an influx of Cuban fighters. There's probably 20 or 30 of them out there fighting now that have fled Cuba and come to the United States and are making a name for themselves and they were tremendous amateurs. What they really were was professionals who had to fight amateur under the Castro regime. But now that they're fighting in the States, I think a lot of them are going to dominate the sport. The problem with the Cubans are that they have defected from Cuba, which means that they have come recently to the United States or Europe, which means that they tend to be Black, rather than the Cubans who came over here right after Castro and in subsequent years, tended to be virtually all White. Well, the crux of it is the racial issue, there's no question about it and that's always been the major divide. I think you go to Miami, try and find a Black Cuban. It's a difficult thing. And obviously the people who benefited the most from the revolution were Black. Cubans that came over right after Castro do not in any way relate to these Cubans. So everybody says, "Hey, you got a great fighter, like Kimbo, do a fight in Miami for the Cubans. And the answer is they have no interest. If they're the Cuban heavyweight that that would do good if they represent the Castro government, they immediately get erased. I'd say Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon, they, you have a few people here, but for the most part they'll ignore them. Now we're getting Cuban fighters that are really good, good fighters. This Gamboa is sensational ever see, I haven't seen anything like it in a long time. There's Rigondeaux. Boy, that's a tremendous fighter. If the political situation in Cuba would change, and for some reason, Cuban boxers or Cuban men and women could join their professional ranks, like other Latin American fighters do, like Mexican fighters, do like Puerto Rican fighters do, I have no doubt, no doubt that Cuban will explode with world champions because the talent is there. The love for boxing is there in Cuba still to this day. Yeah, if the Cubans could compete, you know, on a professional level, it will only enhance the sport of boxing because there is such a combustion of energy and talent, you know? And when the Cubans fought, you know, that was beautiful, man. Well, my name is Oscar De La Hoya. I was born and raised in East Los Angeles, and I am a 10 time world champion and Olympic gold medalist, Barcelona 92. Where you stand in your career depends a lot on who's in the ring at the same time, who your contemporaries are. For instance, Rocky Marciano fought Joe Lewis and he fought Ezzard Charles and he fought Joe Walcott at the end of their careers, but there's a lot of people who feel Rocky Marciano was a great fighter. He just didn't have to fight guys who were in their prime, and that's not Rocky Marciano's fault that he fought the best that was around at that time, including a much younger Archie Moore and same with Oscar de la Hoya. He didn't come along when Tommy Hearns was a welterweight or Sugar Ray Leonard, those guys are considered, you know, Ray Leonard is an all-time great fighter and Tommy was pretty darn good himself. I will say this about de la Hoya, he never ducked one guy. When we would sit down and offer him fights, he never passed on a guy. He didn't care if a guy was a lefty or righty, or he didn't care of his opponent was tall or short. He just said, whichever one pays the most money, that's who I want to fight and he was the best of his era, just like Rocky Marciano was the best of his era. My promoter in the beginning of my career was Bob Arum. More Trampler because Trampler is the mastermind behind all the matchmaking and, but it was quite unique with me because I was always willing to fight anybody. You know, just, you put me with anybody, I'll fight them. And that's one of the, you know, I pride myself for being able to fight a lot of these big name fighters and have big mega fights with them. But they did a great job in picking and choosing my, the right opponents, the right styles to make sure that I develop the right way, you know, in order to become a great fighter one day and so Bruce Trampler did an amazing job and I give him all the credit in the world. There is nothing more important than exposure. That's why with Oscar, you know, he came off a great performance in the Olympics in Barcelona, winning a gold medal. But we early on made sure that even for less money, Oscar fought on network television. He was on ABC. He was on CBS. So more people saw him. You have to expose the athlete to the biggest possible audience. Oscar certainly transcends the sport and being able to speak both English and Spanish was a very big, very important part. Good-looking, articulate, very settled, you wouldn't even know he was in a fight. The reasons that that fans embrace a fighter as one of their own, it all depends again, on who's in the opposite corner. Oscar went through a long stretch in his career, where unfortunately, he was fighting all Mexican nationals. He fought Chavez Sr. twice. He fought Miguel Angel Gonzalez, and he fought a few other guys that kind of polarized the Mexican fans. The nationals rooted for the national and a lot of the Mexican Americans with strong Hispanic-Mexican roots, voted for, you know, rooted for the national, also. So Oscar was in a lose-lose situation, and he didn't want to fight Mexicans, but that's what was out there. I won the Olympic gold in 1992, and my life instantly changed overnight. I remember flying to LAX from Barcelona with the whole Olympic team and once those doors opened, I mean, thousands of people at the airport and my life instantly changed and so I was the golden boy. I was loved by everyone. I had no enemies whatsoever. I had no critics. I had, I was the American dream. So I started winning fights professionally and everything was great. People were supporting me 100%. I had no naysayers whatsoever. When I faced Julio Cesar Chavez in 1996, the Mexican, the great Mexican hero, the Mexican legend, well, then the critics started coming out. The criticism started flying everywhere. Well, he's not one of us. He's not Mexican enough. Ah, he was born here in the States. We're not going to support him because he doesn't really, his roots doesn't need, doesn't really support his roots and this and that. And so then I started to be confused like, "What's going on here? Why are these people against me?" You know, I feel I'm Mexican, I feel that I have my Mexican roots and I'm very proud of them. You know, I was just very proud to be born here in the States. I mean, the United States gave me the opportunity to go to Barcelona and win a gold medal and I'm in debt with this country. We realized early on with de la Hoya that you couldn't make him a big Hispanic star, a crossover star, without having him identify with Mexico and therefore, maybe for less money, we sold television right to his fights in Mexico to get the biggest possible audience. Oscar, by the hardcore Mexican fans, was not accepted as a Mexican. For all his success, they didn't accept Oscar because he wasn't in their eyes, a true Mexican. He was of Mexican descent, but he was born in America. I stuck to my, I stuck to my beliefs that, you know what I was born in this country, in the USA. I'm proud to be American. But my roots are Mexican. You know, my blood that runs through my veins is Mexican because my parents are Mexican. But you know what? The United States is my country. One of the great conundrums of boxing is that fighters who are of Mexican descent in America, will be treated in such an odd way in America when they're fighting a Mexican national. It defies description. It defines part of Oscar de la Hoya's career because clearly he was not seen by a lot of the Hispanic population as authentic enough and if he fights Julio Cesar Chavez 50 times, every single time, more of the Mexican-American community will be rooting for Julio Cesar Chavez. When he fought a Pernell Whitaker, or when he fought some of the other guys, Tito Trinidad, where you had your dream match, Puerto Rican versus Mexican or Mexican-American, all the Mexicans were on Oscar's side in those fights, but it's when he fought another Mexican. And again, it was just timing. It was fate that, you know, Ruelas he had to fight Rafael Ruelas who was born in Mexico. And what are you going to do? Oscar was born in East LA, but in his heart, he's a Mexican. Well, the chicks loved him, you know, but a lot of it had to do with marketing. But you have to back it up too, you have to win these fights. A lot of guys have good marketing and matchmakers and promoters, but they don't back it up. But Oscar did. I mean, it was no accident that wherever we brought Oscar, who was a good-looking young man, that the girls went crazy, but we fomented that. We passed out signs, you know, "I love you, Oscar. Marry me Oscar." And we help create that buzz among women, which fighters generally don't have. But that wasn't novel. We learned that from the making of Frank Sinatra, where his people passed out all of the signs to the young girls who went crazy for Sinatra, and then it takes off and you can't put a stop to it. Well, look, obviously they had a great product to work with. I always lend myself to any type of publicity. You know, I'm not the worst looking fighter out there. I was very charismatic. I understood the game. I just understood it and it was a team effort. It's a team effort from their publicists to my team, to myself, obviously, to Bob Arum, to Bruce Trampler, it was all a team effort and, you know, it was quite a unique, unique experience of developing this persona in boxing, which was a lot of fun. Well, Oscar, the number one attraction in box office. I mean, Bob Arum and Bruce Trampler, they did an extraordinary job early in his career before Golden Boy got going and got him off the ground and the fact that he fought in the Olympics, it was the exposure, but he had a lot of things going for him. First off, he was a great fighter. He had a great heart, a great ability as an athlete and then he was a wonderful person. Oscar is a lovely, lovely guy. Every day, every morning, Oscar should wake up and he should call Bob and Bruce and say, "How you guys doing? The kids, okay?" Because they obviously made something out of a very talented fighter. He won a lot of titles. He fought a lot of names, not always when they were in the prime of their careers by a long shot. Some guys point to Oscar's record in major fights. It's not very good. It's not very good. Oscar was a very good fighter. Bruce Trampler who is our matchmaker, did a wonderful job matching him. Oscar was never a great fighter. There were always guys out there that we knew who could beat him, but Oscar was a good fighter. There was no question about it. He was a good fighter. As long as he was on a run, he fought some tough, top guys. So, but a great fighter. No, I mean he, great fighter is a Manny Pacquio, a great fighter is a Trinidad. They were greater than Oscar was. I don't think Oscar was a great fighter, but I think he could have been a great fighter and the reason I say that is Oscar was a victim of his own success. He went from fighting four or five times a year, which is a lot today. It wasn't in the era of Ray Robinson, but in today's market, that was a lot of fights. Oscar made so much money and enjoyed so much success in and out of the ring that he became essentially a twice a year guy. And he would fight on the traditional Mexican holidays of, you know, in may and in September. And he wouldn't do anything in between. He didn't stay in the gym and, you know, hone his skills. He didn't, he wasn't, it's not that he didn't like boxing. He loved it, but he had too many other things to do with his life and if he'd fought four times a year, and if he'd taken the time to go to Mexico to fight once or twice, he would, he would have been as huge as he was, as great as success as he had, he would have been even bigger and he would have been a better fighter if he's fought a few more times. In the eighties, there were some good heavyweights. Boy, there was some good heavyweights, but during the eighties, but the heavyweights out there today, not so good. To have a Mexican champion. It's the world, you know? It's like the way I, the only way I can compare it is like back in the days when there wasn't an African-American champion and then Jack Johnson came, he just changed the face of the earth. He just changed the whole boxing scene. You know, just the fact that there was a Black man that won the world heavyweight title. He was their black Superman. And that's what I'm trying to be. I'm the Brown Superman. If we had a Mexican heavyweight, they will all come. Very hard to get great fighters from a Latin countries because the size, most of the people, as you know, in Mexico, they are people 5'5 ", 5'6". Some inception in Argentina because the mix of the Italian as pioneers. You had some German, some French, they come out some big guys and that you can, you got guys like Monzon, champion of the world. Galindez, like heavyweight, you got Hugo Corro. Mexico, we only can talk about, "Pipino" Cuevas as a welterweight, right? The reason we don't have big Latinos in boxing 'cause it's easier to be in a team sport than it is in the boxing ring. The average Latino, who's got some size to him, do one of two things, either football or baseball. And that's why we don't have a lot of heavyweights in Puerto Rico that are boxing. For that matter Hispanics period. That's why you don't see a lot of heavyweights because most of them either go to football, if you see to California, or they go through a baseball. When you're talking about why some Latin people, that are big sided, they're playing baseball or they're playing football and their own play and they don't box. You got the, you just say the word play and box. Play is one thing. Box is completely different thing. Box is not playing. You're fighting. There's no tradition with Hispanic young men of the heavyweight stature to go into boxing. The tradition is for the lighter weight fighters. So absent that tradition, the idea that you'd hit the lightning in a bottle and you get a Hispanic kid who, was this talented as an Ali or a Ken Norton or a Joe Frazer. It is not likely to happen. That's correct. The heavyweight division is suffering now because we don't have big guys to come in there and knock people out. No one wants to see heavyweights, just move around for 12 rounds. They want to see someone get hurt and go down. Arreola, Chris has just lost. To me he was not in good shape, you know, for whatever reason, the biggest fight of his career, and he looked like he wasn't even there. I talked to him a month before the fight. We went in for the fight with Liam and Campbell, and he was in the. Now I hope you going to do this, he said, don't worry about it. He didn't do nothing other than just to batter himself. If we had a Latino heavyweight with talent, oh, the world would be the limit. I mean, the world would be his, you know? That's why when I see a guy, like certain guys come into the ring out of shape, I won't go into any names here. I think we know, but I mean, I'm amazed. They're young men that they don't really realize, you know, they haven't lived enough years, that one day he's going to kick himself in the butt ans say, "I could have done this." Because we have a Latino heavyweight that I believe, if he was in good shape and maybe his mind had a different way of thinking, would beat, could beat the Klitschkos easily. When Chris Arreola wins the title, it'll be huge. I think, you know, I had spoken to a good friend of mine who taught from Top Rank and he told me that if Chris wins the heavyweight title, he'll be the biggest thing in the sport of boxing, If there were a Hispanic heavyweight champion, who was talented, had some charisma, and was marketable in any conceivable way, he would be the biggest thing boxing has seen in 50 years. It would be monstrous. When and if we get a heavyweight champion, that same guy could sell out any arena, okay? You catch hell trying to buy tickets and he'd be immediately invited to the White House. But I mean, it will be I think, be a great day. Sometime, one of these days, we'll have another one, that can really stay there for a long time and it'll be really great for the Latino community. For a guy that could speak English and Spanish and be a heavyweight, it would be the more languages you can speak, the more popular you're going to be in the world scene. If you go down the weight classification, can you imagine as big a stars as Duran was in Panama and Julio Cesar Chavez was in Mexico. Can you imagine if they spoke English? In the primes of their career, how big of stars they would have been? And how they would have been utilized in commercial television in the United States? So with that said, you can just imagine, cause everything gets upgraded when you go to the heavyweight division. It's been over 46 Years, since the heavyweight division has been in the position that it is as it is today. Over 46 years that United States has not owned some parts of that heavyweight division. I'm not one of the people that subscribes to the theory that there has to be great heavyweight division for boxing to be a good sport. I could care less. However, clearly there are people that see the heavyweight division as the bellwether of boxing and for such a man to win the heavyweight title would be amazing. Boxing is the biggest one time event is the biggest sports in the world. It our grosses everything. I know because my nephew had the highest grossing gate in the history of boxing when he fought de la Hoya. That fight made over $300,000,000 in one night. So what does that tell you? MMA don't make $300 million, I don't know, if they had 10 or 15 shows. I mean, MMA is good, but it ain't going to compete with boxing. MMA has done a tremendous job, particularly UFC, the others I'm not familiar with, but UFC has done a great job promoting their product. I think their product is garbage, but that's my opinion. When you put mixed martial arts and boxing both underneath the combat sports tent. First, there is a lot of room in that tent. It's a big, big, big tent worldwide. It has made very little impact on the Hispanic community, almost none. Every once in a while, they go after an MMA fighter who's Hispanic. It has absolutely no impact. Generally, Hispanics don't like MMA. My feeling is that as mixed martial arts continues to stay here as a sport, which it's going to, and as it continues to develop, more Hispanics will be involved in mixed martial arts. I believe that Dana White hit her on the money. He's making a lot of money with the UFC. It is a sport, I don't call it that. It's not even a sport, but it is a sport. People like it, people, I mean, they pay any kind of money to go see that and it's a successful business. I work for the UFC once in a while, and there's a line of people outside the casino to go see the weigh-in. These people that don't have tickets. They just want to see who's going to fight tomorrow. That's a successful business. I had never seen a business blow up so big as the UFC. It's a huge business. Anywhere they go, they sell out. In London, that's a total overseas. When they have it here, sold out, sold out and they don't have that many stars. I think you've got two different crowds. You've got two different crowds. They're both fighting sports and so naturally they're going to be compared, but boxing has its crowd and the MMA have theirs and a lot of the younger people are going toward the MMA. They're coming up and they're not being, they're not excited by what they're seeing, going in the ring. Anyone who ignores the fact that boxing is in a decline is a fucking moron. The fan base of the sport, you can see that there's a difference in age. You know, the older kind of guy, let's say an average fan will go more for boxing. The younger generation is more, it's going more towards MMA. It's just instant gratification you know? You have a 30 second fight and people are happy to see a blow up as opposed to an eight, 10 round fight where guys are trying to figure each other out and see how they're going to hurt on another. I think as the younger demographic going for the martial arts, they go for boxing. Boxing people are knowledgeable. They know what to look for. The say they can see a star coming, a star rising. The UFC is a bunch of people that just want to see somebody beat up each other. There's a lot of UFC fighters now are starting to learn that boxing is helping them get through the next fight, but those fights are so brutal and that's what the people want to see: Blood. That's they pay to see. In boxing, you get a cut, they stop a fight. That's no good. That's the difference. Boxing people are knowledgeable. UFC, they just want to get drunk and cheer on and see blood. That's a big, big difference. And the audience is a lot younger, too, in the UFC. I mean, if you look at at MMA stars, a lot of them are White kids and Black kids. More of them are non, you have fewer Spanish speakers in MMA as stars right now than you do in boxing. Boxing is far more dominated by Spanish speaking athletes and Latinos or Latino Americans than MMA is. You see in MMA fans that you see, of course we know younger fans, more Caucasian, little less nationalism and pride for their country. More pride for the style they like, or the fighter they like and you also see fans in MMA who are looking for and appreciating quicker action. It's going to be done. It could be done like that. You could turn away and it could be over with. So a lot quicker action. And I think, yeah, those things are dividing MMA fans and boxing fans because boxing fans are, tend to be, you know, knowledgeable of the styles of the two opponents, the histories of who they've fought and willing to watch this unfold in the ring over a matter of maybe 12 rounds or 48 minutes. You can put one of the side by side on pay-per-view, boxing always wins. And even though, you know, you're the UFC, the MAA, they all drag big fans in all over the world, big pay-per-views and, but you know what I mean, people still love boxing boxing and they, and they, and that's their passion and I think that when they have the opportunity to have a chance, they always will pick boxing. MMA is a good sport, but it ain't never going to be as big as boxing. Some people call is legalized street fighting. It's a little more than that. These are great technicians, great fighters, but, you know, a lot guys, everyone thinks they can do it. Where not everyone thinks they can be a fighter in boxing because there's an artistry about it. Great athletes, wonderful athletes and for the street, you know, they always say, they say the great saying. We admire fighters, admire them very much. We respect them very much. And they said, they hit us. Anybody get knocked out and he hit us, good chance they'll knock us out, but it's like shooting an elephant with a bullet. You get one shot, one shot, and that's what they do is they make you miss. Then, they're all over you. They're like there like a snake, all over it. They tie you up, when you go to the dirt, that's it, that's their game. Novice heavyweights would not get hit with tap-down punches, you know, you're taught how to block punches, slip your head. You gotta move your head a little bit. And I could tell, we got to make them miss once in a while but the MMA guys get hit, they're not used to it. They're not used to getting tapped. They're great on the ground game, but they're not used to getting tapped on a daily basis. So in the gym, we're sparring every day, every day, grappling and rolling around. In the street, all of a sudden they get tapped on the chin, you know, they're out of it. Not that they can't take a shot. They just ain't used to taking a shot. If it's mixed martial arts, or if it's boxing, you got to have a guy that has been in the business, has worked his way up and went to school and really know how to fight. You can't have these guys come in as the champion one week, and next week is the new champion and all of that. The fans lose interest. I don't see nothing that I like at a martial arts. In fact, Mr. Freititas, his partner heard me or listen to this, they were really upset with me. Boxing has a history. People will know who the first world champion was. People will know which world champion now to this day. MMA, you don't even know who the world champion is. Who's champion? The day that I tell my wife I'm going to quit, it was like I lost half my life, you know? I don't know, and she was so happy she cried all night long. In the streets, I'm left alone. Never had any problems in the street unless you hit me. I just think boxing will come back. You know, it's been down before, when I've been in it, but I will come back.
