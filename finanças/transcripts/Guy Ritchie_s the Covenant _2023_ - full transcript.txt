Well, let's get going. How's it going, JJ? Almost there. Yo, get him to open the trunk. Jack Jack? On it! [speaking Dari] [in English] Is there a problem here? [Jack Jack] Time's up! [speaking foreign language] Eddie. Chow chow? Eddie's ready. Tom? Don't talk to me, talk to John. John! Chow chow? [Jack Jack] What's in the back of the truck? Jack Jack? Fishy, John. Yeah, hold tight. Comin' in. [suspenseful music playing] -[interpreter] He says it's empty. -[Jack Jack] Don't fool... -[man speaking Dari] -[horns blaring] Tell him to open it! -[both speaking Dari] -[horns blaring] -[Jack Jack] Tell him to stop! -[interpreter shouting in Dari] -[John] Jack Jack? -[Jack Jack] Tell him to fuckin'-- [soldier, distorted] Jack Jack! Fuck! [soldier] Jack Jack! Move! Move! Move! Now! Move, move! [mournful instrumental music playing] [man over speaker] All blue personnel to report to communal area for 1800 hours. Aircraft engine maintenance required on runway five. [Steve] Thank you, bro. [John] I heard he's a solid guy. We'll get him ready, huh? Jizzy? [Jizzy] Looks like he got some fresh panties on. Sergeant Kinley? Steve Kersher, uh, I'm the new ECO. Nice to meet you. Kersher? Pleasure. Hey, JJ. Meet your new junior. Hey, I'm JJ. Hey, what's up? Steve. -Introduce him to the boys. -Sure. Come meet the guys. -Guys. Kersher. He's our new ECO. -[soldier] Hey, Kinley. I got your interpreter. [Steve] 'Sup? I'm Steve. They all military trained? Some more than others, but they all been through basic. I need someone in shape. You see that bald one with the beard? I'd bite that one. Now, he speaks four languages that are worth speaking. He can be kinda tricky, though. He won't be pushed around. Some units don't like him, you know, they won't work with him. All right, have him step forward. Hey, Ahmed. Step forward. Do you smoke? No, not for me, sir. No. Why you want this job? I need the money, sir. And what was your profession before this? Mechanic. You good with cars? Anything with an engine. Oh, yeah? Well, what's... what's this? That's an engine, sir. You patronizing me, Ahmed? No. No. I would never patronize an officer, sir. How long you been here? Five years. Do you like it? It's a job, sir. Well, Akhmed, this unit specializes in finding Taliban munitions and explosive sites. Basically, we get into trouble. Sadly... we lost our last interpreter. Understood. And it's "Ahmed", sir. Oh. Yeah. Well, it's "Sergeant", not "sir". Hey, guys, meet Ahmed, our new interpreter. -[soldier 1] Hey. What up, bro? -[soldier 2] What's up, Ahmed? Don't disappoint and turn out to be a pain in the ass. Not me, sir. [rock music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Eddie] Fucking gross. I'd kill for some swine. [JJ] Do you only think about food? [Tom] And he just ate. There's nothing here a man can eat. Tom, what does that eat? What it always eats, sausage. There's nothing wrong with a little sausage. You just keep telling yourself that, Chow Chow. All right, all right, children. School time. [Ahmed] You know, if you're looking for weapons, you are not gonna find any here. [loud knocking on metal door] Oh, yeah? How do you know? [Ahmed] I know what goes on behind these doors. Ah. The Oracle doth speak. Again, Haadee. [man grumbles in Dari] [Ahmed speaking in Dari] [in English] All right. [breathing heavily] [Jizzy] Clear! [John] All clear. [Eddie] Clear. [Tom] All clear, too. [Ahmed clears throat] Clear. The fuck is this place? What's it look like? It's a fuckin' sports bar. [speaking Dari] [John] What's he saying? [Ahmed] He says your intel is poo-poo. Oh, another Oracle. [sighs] I'm just tired of this bullshit. [sighs deeply] All right, well, I'm gonna stay here and have a smoke. I'll see you guys at sunrise. [sighs] How come you know so much about what cooks here? [Ahmed] I'm a man about town. So, this is how you spend your lazy afternoons? You're a dark horse, Ahmed. [groaning] All right. [sighs] Let's get outta here. Don't lick, squeeze, or pop anything. Jizzy, don't touch that pipe. Well, that was fun. On to the next one, I guess. [solemn instrumental music playing] [Steve] Jackpot! Fuckin' Tali HQ. We got 'em surrounded. [JJ] Haadee, pull security for a second. [John] What a quaint little house on the prairie. You and I could retire here, Jizzy. And we can adopt a labradoodle and milk something. What are these coordinates? It's turning into a fuck fest. Where is this intel coming from? Straight outta head office. -What'd you wanna do, John? -I wanna stop wasting time. Anyway, we got a couple hours. You got that barbeque, Chow Chow? What do you think? [sizzling] [exhales] Impressive. You know, whatever they may say about us, Ahmed, we're not all animals, apart from Chow Chow, of course. [John clears throat] [beverage cans popping] To Jack Jack. [all] To Jack Jack. When do you think Steve should get his first beer? Yeah, I don't know. When do you get to drink your first beer, Steve? Uh, whenever you say so, sir. -[beer can pops] -Bon appetit. Merci, mon general. To the boots I hope to fill, boys. How do you like them apples, sir? I love these goddamn apples, John. I wouldn't normally bother you with issues like this, sir, but you're the only one who'll get anything done around here. Oh, yeah? What's the problem? We keep going out and achieving nothing. I keep putting my men in constant danger. It just feels like we're moving sand around a sandbox. I heard your needle got stuck on this point before. Look, you've been tasked with finding IED factories. You can get creative in finding them, yeah? Do it your way. I don't think you'll like my way. I don't think it's important whether I like it or not, especially if I don't know about it. I really enjoyed not having this conversation. You have a good day. I enjoyed not having this conversation with you also, sir. [soldier] We are waiting on you to get back, sir. ETA, 23:00. I know, sir. [printer beeps, whirring] Declan? John? Come through for me? I feel used by you, John. You only ever want me for my brains. Oh. It's not like you're a generous lover. Well, that's 'cause you never bought me dinner first. And, no, I did not come through. It took me years to get these stripes and I'm not peeling them off for you. And since you didn't have a conversation with Vokes I just saw you having, it would be impossible for me to give you this list of unvetted targets. You always play hard to get. All you gotta do is chase me. [officer over speaker] Aircraft engine maintenance required on runway six. What you doin'? -Oh. Tightening the fan belt, sir. -You recognize this guy? Yes, I do. All right, come with me. [people chatting indistinctly] [John] That's him. That's Faraj. Let's do this. [suspenseful music playing] [Eddie] Stay still. Don't say a fuckin' word. [John] Oh, relax. We're gonna go for a ride. -[Faraj speaking Dari] -[Eddie] Come on. Move. [John] Easy, easy. -Move. Move. Go. -[Faraj grunting] -Easy. -[Faraj muttering in Dari] [John] Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go! [indistinct chatter] Say "cheese". [speaking in Dari] [spits] [John] Tell him that this could go one of two ways. The money way, or the other way. [in Dari] That doesn't sound very positive. [Ahmed in English] He's not too keen to help. [John] That it? [Ahmed] Pretty much, yes. Give him some lube. Carrot. Stick. [in Dari] [Ahmed in English] He's ready. Simple question. Where do they build the IEDs? [speaking Dari] [scoffs] What'd he say? [Ahmed in English] He's fishing. He wants more cash. Tell him he'll get it when we finish the job. We can save a lot of time here if we give him the cash. Excuse me? He'll get it when we finish the job. [speaking Dari] [Ahmed sighs] -[Faraj continues speaking Dari] -[shushes] -The f-- -[Faraj speaking Dari] [Ahmed sighs] [in English] He has a lead. [dogs continuously barking in the distance] A lot of fuckin' dogs around here. [John] Hey, Eddie? What did Faraj say to Ahmed? He said he'd wipe out his bloodline, and murder him in front of his wife before he fed her to the dogs. How do they know each other? Not sure this is common knowledge, but from what I understand, Ahmed used to work in the heroin trade. It's a family business. They used to work with the Taliban. So then, why is he workin' for us? Because the Talis killed his son. Why the fuck didn't you tell me this before? It's the price of givin' orders. [John sighs] Don't ever override my authority again. I understood your objective. I apologize for my clumsy method. So, we understand each other? Yes, Sergeant. [somber instrumental music playing] Good work. -[Vokes] Okay. Yeah. -[knocks on door] Okay, buddy. All right, thank you. Bye. Sir. [Vokes] Well, you got your result. What do you think, John? There are two sites. Do this one at a time. Keep it quiet. Well, you need any help, I'm a phone call away, all right? Thank you. [Jizzy] The first IED location is 30 clicks. One hour's drive on a straight track. And then we reach a fork in the road, and bang a left. Excuse me. Sorry. Yeah, what is it, Haadee? When we reach the fork in the road, my feeling is that the quickest route is to turn right, even though left is shorter as the crow flies. Well, quickest, why? According to the map, it's not. In the last rainfalls, most of the road on the left got washed away. What do you think, Jizzy? I guess so. There is no intel to confirm or deny. All right, how much time does it add to the journey? About 20 minutes. Thirty, tops. All right. So, we got a plan. Right is right. -Push that to the highers. -Cool. -Okay, let's move out. -All right, let's go. [dramatic orchestral music playing] [Ahmed] Sergeant Kinley, can you please stop the vehicle? [John] Excuse me? [Ahmed] I need to speak to you, Sergeant. [John] We don't stop the vehicles. We keep moving. [Ahmed] I think we have a problem. Please stop the vehicle, Sergeant. [John] Okay, stop the truck, Jizzy. -[over radio] All vehicles for a tactical stop. -[Jizzy] Come on, guys. -What is it, Ahmed? -[Jizzy] Three-sixty watch. -Let's go! -Something's wrong. There's no logical reason for Haadee to lead us down this route, unless... Unless what? ...unless he's leading us into a trap. Well, that's a pretty big assumption, Ahmed. Deduction, not assumption. Now you're teachin' me English? [soldier] North side clear. I've been thinking about all the possible reasons why he'd take this route. All the answers smell bad. He lied about the road being washed out. The rainfalls didn't affect this area. Haadee's been vetted. You can say whatever you want, Sergeant. We just don't wanna go down this road. You're out of your bounds, Ahmed. You're here to translate. Actually, I'm here to interpret. All right. You wanna be right, Ahmed? -Hey, Jizzy. Check the drone. -On it. JJ, Tom Cat, go up to the top of those rocks there -and tell me what you see. -[JJ] Copy that. [Jizzy] Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2, this is Havoc 3-3. [operator over radio] Havoc 3-3, -this is Viper 6-2, over. -Roger. We need live imagery now. Why have we stopped? The road is safe. What are we waiting for, John? I'm waitin' to hear if there's a fuckin' ambush up ahead. [both speaking Dari] [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [operator] ETA, ten minutes. Look, I haven't got ten minutes. We need the imagery now. [operator] Roger that. Grid to mark, 4-5. [both panting] [John over radio] JJ? All clear. Tom Cat? All clear, too. -It's clear. -[operator] 6-2 for Havoc 3-3, -we're live. -Viper 6-2, imagery received. -Havoc 3-3, out. -[operator] Roger. [Jizzy] Okay, what do we got here? [Steve] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ahmed, stop! Get the fuck off! Get the fuck off Haadee! John! Get the fuck off of him, Ahmed! -Put the fucking gun down! -[John yelling] Hey! Hey! Get that gun out of his throat! He's a traitor. I don't give a fuck what he is. You take that gun out of his throat. He gave up our position. Take the gun out of his throat. [tense music playing] I am not gonna ask you again. [breathing heavily] [Haadee gasps, coughs] [grunts] [unclips gun] [Haadee speaking Dari] He says they have his family. [Jizzy over radio] John, you're not gonna like this. What is it? [Jizzy] We've got a problem. What the fuck is it? [Jizzy] Looks like an ambush. Tali kill box eight klicks up this road. All right, let's turn this thing around. -Get back to base. - [Jizzy] Copy. Get in the truck. [Haadee mumbles in Dari] Pick him up. [Eddie speaking Dari] [grunts, inhales] [boy] Look what I got, Daddy. Look what I got. It's from Johnny's dad. -Why are you going to bed at lunchtime? -[woman titters] No, baby. Time is different here, you remember? I'm ten hours ahead of you. It's nighttime. I miss you. I miss you, too. All of you. Hey, kids? You let me talk to Mommy for just a second? [woman] I'll be out in a minute. -[boy] Love you, Daddy. -[girl] Love you, Daddy. I love you, too. Have a good rest of your day. [woman chuckles softly] -Hey, sweetheart. -Hey, babe. How's... how's business? Well, it's... it's good. We have bookings for the next six weeks and beyond. -That's good news. -Mm-hmm. How are the books? We're up on last quarter. So, you're all over it. You're all over it. Oh, you know me, of course I am. Just another one of the reasons I love you. Well, you know how much I love you, John. -Just hurry up and get home. -[whispers] Yeah. [people chattering indistinctly in Dari] [keys jingling] [dogs barking in distance] -[door shuts] -[Ahmed speaking Dari] [woman sighs heavily] [kisses] [woman sighs] [both speaking Dari] [Ahmed chuckles softly] [men shouting indistinctly outside] [in English] Hey. [speaking Dari] -Ease up 'til they get back. -Sir? [Vokes] John. Interpreter came through, huh? [sighs] Just don't know how wild he is. Yeah, well, he still saved eight people's lives. Yes, he did. So, what's your next move? -Second location, 120 klicks away. -Awesome. Three hours in a Humvee should be fun for the old back. Well, you could give us a couple of birds. Yeah. No. Happy hunting. Thank you, sir. [tense instrumental music playing] [Tom speaking over radio] [John over radio] All right, look. [Tom speaking over radio] [Jizzy speaking over radio] [JJ speaking over radio] [Jizzy speaking over radio] [John] Nothing like a three-hour drive. [over radio] All right, we're 120 clicks from base, and 30 minutes from air support, so, uh, do a final comms check, Tom Cat. Roger that. Comms clear, John. Put your fuckin' hands up now! Get your fuckin' hands up now! Put your hands up! Get in line over here! Now! [Ahmed speaking Dari] [miner speaking Dari] [Ahmed speaking] [miner continues indistinctly] [man on phone speaking Dari] [man on phone] [in English] Something's not right. He's lying. Jizzy, hold what you got. Secure the area. We're moving up. [Jizzy] On it. -[JJ] Hey! Come here! -[man shouting in Dari] Move! This guy was on his phone! [Jizzy] Give me that! Put your hands on your head! [John] On me. Kawa, pick up the rear. [Kawa] Roger. [Jizzy] Everybody on the floor! -On the floor! -[JJ] Get down! Now! [dramatic orchestral music playing] Clear. [John] Kawa, take over watch. Keep eyes on the road. [over radio] John, it's Jizzy. We found a big weapons cache down here. What do you wanna do? Secure those bodies, take up a security position and stand by. [Jizzy] Copy. Hands behind your backs! Get 'em on the floor! -Don't fuckin' move! -[Tom] Get down! [Jizzy] Tom Cat, JJ, cuff 'em. Kersher, watch the fuckin' road. [tie zipping] [Taliban member speaking Dari indistinctly] [distant laughter] [conversing in Dari] -[laughter] -[hostage straining] [hostage groans] No! No! No! No! [hostage screaming] Tom Cat, it's John. We got an IED factory. Four Tangos. We need air support immediately. We're goin' in. Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2, this is Havoc 3-3. We've hit jackpot. Requesting immediate QRF. Over. [operator over radio] Copy, Havoc 3-3, assigning QRF. Ahmed, you stay here. We don't need a translator for this. [shouting indistinctly in Dari] [man on video recorder speaking Dari] Fuckin' animals. [grunts] It's Jack Jack's killer. [gunshot] -[screaming in Dari] -[cries out] [Eddie] Fuck! [groans] -[John] Fuck. -[Eddie] Fuck! [Eddie groans in pain] -Clear. You all right? -[groaning] [Eddie] Motherfucker got me in the arm. -[John] Ahmed! We good? -[Ahmed] We're good. -[Eddie] Fuck. -[John] Watch the door. [Eddie] Fuck! Hold on, stay there. [grunting in pain] [breathing heavily] [John] All right, charge is set. Three minutes. -Let's go. Move. -[Eddie grunts] Move, move, move. Hold, hold. Move, move. All units, we have a three-minute burning fuse. [over radio] Keep that 50-K locked on the north road. [Kawa] Copy that. -[John] Kawa, we are on your left. Cover us-- -[gun fires] Shit! Eddie! Eddie! [exhales] [sounds fade] -[dramatic music playing] -Eddie's down. -[over radio] Eddie's down. -Get 'em on their feet. -Get up! -Get up right now! -Get up right now! -Move! [John over radio] We're at the top of the hill, making our way to you. Move him, move him. I don't want the fuckin' Taliban to see him. [Kawa over radio] Steve, Talis approaching. -Eleven o'clock. Two SUVs. -Contact north! Two Taliban trucks! Get in position. -Keep your eyes on the road! -[JJ over radio] Copy! [Steve] Covering nine o'clock. -[Jizzy] Shit! -[Steve] Talis on the north bridge!

[pilot on radio] Viper 6-2, we are 15 minutes out. [machine gun continues firing] [Steve over radio] First truck has arrived at the left at the north entrance. Kersher's down. Tom Cat, get on the gun! [over radio] Go! Go! Steve is down. Over. Hold position. Coming to you. [Kawa] SUV inbound. East entrance. [indistinct shouting in Dari] [Kawa over radio] Second SUV approaching. East entrance. Kawa, let's move! Following, John-- -[sound distorts] -[high-pitched ringing] [explosion] [muffled explosions] Open fire-- [screaming] Tom Cat! [muffled gunfire] [mournful violin music playing] [Jizzy over radio] JJ's down! Move! [John] Fuck. [groans] Fuck! [grunts] [yelling in Dari] Move! John! John! We need a plan now! You have an SUV coming. We'll cover you. Take that truck, go to higher ground, and take a position. [Jizzy] John, we're fuckin' pinned! [John] Move. Move. [Jizzy] Cover me! -[explosion] -[John] Jizzy, go, go! Ahmed, get in! Get in! [Jizzy on radio] John, follow me. Straight ahead. We'll punch up the-- Fuck. Jizzy! Jizzy! [scattered gunfire continues] [Taliban members shouting in Dari] Control this. Dagger 1-2. Dagger 1-2. Dagger 1-2, this is Dagger 3-3. Come in. We're out of range. Dagger 1-2, Dagger 1-2, this is Dagger 3-3. Come in. [John] Fuck! Ah, shit! We've got a flat. All right, we have to abandon ship. Ahmed. Ahmed. [Taliban members shouting in Dari] [in Dari] [Taliban member shouts orders in Dari] [soldier] Havoc actual. Havoc actual. [operator over radio] Roger. This is Viper 6-2. We have approximately 40 KIA Taliban. We recovered all 3-3 bodies, minus John Kinley and the interpreter. Over. [John] I think we're good for now. [sighs] [solemn instrumental music playing] [huffs] [sniffs] We'll rest here for the night. Here's the challenge. The satnav says the beer is 120 clicks in that direction over shit terrain. And Taliban are everywhere, so we can't use the roads. They will be on us in two minutes. We're not walking, we're double-timing. You good? I'm good. [light percussive instrumental music playing] [calling out in Dari] [speaking Dari] They're on us. Gun up? -[gun clicks] -Gun's up. Let's move. [intense music playing] [both panting] [grunting] [groans] [exclaims] [groans, breathes heavily] [grunts] [indistinct chatter in Dari] [grunts] [both breathing heavily and panting] Where's your fuckin' gun? Halfway up the hill. This belongs to you now. [panting] Just don't lose it. You ready? [panting] Following you, boss. [tense music continues] [indistinct conversation in Dari] [speaking Dari] [grunting] [thuds] [grunts, knife repeatedly stabbing] [Taliban member straining] -[grunts] -[knife stabbing] [breathing heavily] Rifle. [radio chatter] [man speaking Dari over radio] Let's go. [suspenseful percussive music playing] [Taliban member coughs] [gun clicks] [muffled screaming] [grunts] [screaming stops] Hey. Is he dead? Yeah. Get him up. [both straining] [distant radio chatter] [radio chatter continues] [breathing deeply] -[men shouting] -[gunfire echoes loudly] [man shouting in Dari] [shouting orders in Dari] [all conversing in Dari] [panting] [solemn instrumental music playing] [wind blowing] [exclaims in disgust] It fuckin' stinks in there. We'll rack up here for the night. [Taliban leader speaking on radio in Dari] [fly buzzes] [radio static] [soft radio chatter] [soft radio chatter continues] [volume increases] They see a house. -[radio chatter] -[radio clicks off] We haven't seen too many of those. If we can hear them, they gotta be close. Pack up your shit. Ahmed. -[bullet zings] -[gunshot echo amplified] [exclaims and grunts] [gunfire] [grunts] [gunshot firing continues] [grunting] [grunts loudly] [gunshot echo amplified] [cries out] [grunting in pain] [Taliban members shouting in Dari] [groans] -[panting] -[muffled shouting] [Taliban member speaking Dari] [other Taliban members speaking Dari] -[continues speaking Dari] -[thudding] [shouting in Dari] [Taliban member speaking in Dari] [conversing in Dari] -[exclaims] -[heavy thud] [voices fade out] [soft instrumental music playing] [muffled conversation in Dari] [muffled argument] -[voices fade back in] -[gunfire] [groans] [exclaims] [groaning in pain] [somber music playing] [gunshot] [breathing heavily] Hey. John. We're going home. It's gonna be a long journey. We can't take the roads. They know we're here. More men will be coming here in trucks. [grass rustling] [panting] [coughing] [sweeping dramatic music playing] [both shivering] [ragged breathing] Here you go. [distant shouting in Dari] [distant shouting in Dari continues] [suspenseful music playing] [sandstorm rumbling] [distant shouting in Dari] [gun firing] [knocking on truck] [in Dari] [indistinct conversation in Dari and laughter] [exhales in relief] [sighs] [man speaking Dari] [in Dari] [speaking Dari] [people replying in Dari] [Ahmed screaming in effort] [dramatic music builds] [panting, coughing] [groans] [coughing] [choking] [groans] [screams in pain] [grunts] [screams] [panting] [dramatic music intensifies] [grunting] -[yells with effort] -[cart thudding] [straining] [straining continues] [yelling echoes] [grunting] [grunting intensifies] [straining] [screaming] [panting] [gasps] [sniffs] [breathes deeply] [crying softly] [clears throat] [groaning intensely] [dramatic music continues] [sighs] [exhales] [groans] [panting] [woman speaking Dari] [man speaking Dari] -[man mumbles in Dari] -[woman responds in Dari] [Ahmed mumbles indistinctly] [people conversing in Dari] [grunts, exhales] [ominous instrumental music playing] [Taliban speaking in Dari] [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [exhales] [Taliban members screaming in Dari] -[grunting] -[Taliban members yelling in Dari] [grunting] [straining] [straining intensely] [grunts, sighs] [panting] [grunts, panting continuously] [man speaking in Dari] [trucks approaching] [soldiers shouting] [soldier shouting] Put your fucking hands up! Hands up! Get down on the ground! [indistinct shouting] Get down on the ground! Get the fuck down! [soldier 2] Get down! [soldier 1] Stay down! Look away! [Ahmed] I have one of yours. -He's in the cart. -Check the cart. [indistinct radio chatter] It's John fuckin' Kinley. Hey! Hey, it's John fuckin' Kinley. We need a medic over here! [helicopter approaching] [distorted whooshing] [male voice, distorted over speaker] Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8. [echoing breath] [Ahmed] We're going home. We're going home. [echoing deep breath] We're going home. [distorted male voice] Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8. [echoing breath] [distorted male voice speaking indistinctly] [echoed breath] [voice of nurse, distorted] Welcome home, Mr. Kinley. -I'll get your doctor. -[breathes heavily] [machine beeping] [exhales] [Declan] Heard they're giving you a medal, Distinguished Service Cross. -[Caroline] Come on, put it away, guys. -That was quick. -[Caroline] Dinner's in five. -[Declan] Well, you did crawl on your hands and knees over broken glass for a 100 clicks, so... If I did, I don't remember any of it. You still don't remember a thing? I mean, I remember waking up in the hospital. So, why should they give me a medal? They should give it to him. As far as I know, I was just a passenger. I don't think it's a medal he wants as much as a visa he needs. Well, what's goin' on with that? Well, even if we can get the visa, we still gotta find him first. Find him? Where'd he go? Well, after your little hike in Afghanistan, Ahmed found himself a local folk hero to everyone, but the Taliban. Let's just say, they're not pleased he dragged you 100 clicks across their territory, and they were unable to catch you. Your story has developed something of a following among the populous. What's that look like? He ended up on their top ten most-wanted list with a price on his head. Disappeared and went underground with his family. [children chattering indistinctly] [Declan] Before you ask, I reached out to his smack-dealing brother. I sense he knows where he is, but he's not gonna give us that information until we get Ahmed a visa. Ahmed. Ahmed Abdullah. [woman 1 on phone] And how are you spelling that, sir? Yeah, A-B-D... Yes, I know, ma'am. I... [woman 2 over phone] Has his visa been approved? Mr. Abdullah was... was set to have his visa issued. -[man 1 on phone] And the name, sir? -Ahmed. [woman 3 over phone] Your friend needs to fill out -an I-360 form. -I-I can't get him on the phone. His... his family have been forced into hiding. -Ma'am, I've explained this situation to... - [woman 1] Just one minute. -...your supervisor already. Can you not... -Just one minute. -Just gonna put you on hold, sir. -Can you... How are you supposed to do a background check on a three-month-old child? Can you not put me on hold? I have been holding for one and a half hours. Just one minute. [distorted voices] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Well, first we have to figure out how to make sure their visas are issued, and then I can figure out how to find them. Would you leave your wife and child behind? Would you? He disappeared and went underground with his family. He disappeared and went underground with his family, because of you. -Because of you. -[panting] I just gave you all that information. I literally just gave that to your supervisor. No, I'm not related. He's in Afghanistan... [man 2 over phone] Just gonna put you on hold, sir. -[hold music playing] -Fuckin' hold music! You leave people on hold for an hour and a half, they're gonna get frustrated. [John breathing heavily] Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Yes, I have the letter right here. -[woman 4 over phone] From Colonel Masters? -That's correct. Yeah. It's from Colonel Masters. Okay, so yeah, well then how long will that be? It's a minimum nine months, sir. [slams fist] They... they can't wait nine months! If they wait nine months, they will be dead! [sighs] -Good night, boss. -Hey, I'll lock up, Miguel. I'll lock up. [man 3 over phone] You're through to USCIS, -how can I help you, sir? -Uh... [groggily] Are you gonna put me on hold again? -Yeah, go ahead and put me on hold again. -If you could just bear with me for one minute, sir. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't put the phone down. -Don't put the fucking phone down. -It will just take one moment, Sergeant. -I will find someone that can help you. -You put... You fucking put me on hold again, and I will find you. [grunting in frustration] Put me on hold! Come on! [yelling] What's your fucking name, huh? What's your name? [screaming] I will come to your fuckin' house, and I will find you! [hammer thudding repeatedly] There's a fuckin' man stuck in a goddamn cave! I will find you! [sighs] [breathing deeply] [melancholy instrumental music playing] [softly] Drink this. [rustling] [distorted scream] [exhales] [whispers] You're okay. [muffled voices] [heavy breathing] [dogs whining] [gasps] [distorted scream] [distorted scream] Hey. [whispers] Quiet. [gunshots] [Ahmed screaming distortedly] [music fades] John? [groggily] John. As if it wasn't enough for him to carry me across those mountains, now I can't get him out of my fuckin' head. I'm lying in this bed. I kiss my children before they go to school. And he's hiding in a hole somewhere. A hole he can never get out of. A hole that we put him in. And that wasn't the deal. The deal was that we offered his family sanctuary. Then we tied a noose around his neck and we kicked the stool out from under him. [voice breaking] I should be in that hole. [solemn instrumental music playing] You think he blessed you? Well, he fuckin' cursed me. I am a man who gets no rest. [automated voice on phone] Please continue to hold. Your call is in a queue. Please continue to hold. Your call is in a... We both know how this is gonna end. I am gonna have to get him out myself. I know a guy. Parker. Private security contractor. I hear he's very good, and he can help you. But it's gonna cost. We'll have to give you a different name and background. If the Talibs find out that you're back in the country, they'll know why. And they'll throw everything they have at finding you both. [speaking Dari] [Taliban members shouting] [line ringing] [cell phone ringing] [speaking Dari] [kisses, chuckles] -[cell phone ringing] -[Ahmed speaking Dari] [in English] Hello. [Ahmed and Pooya conversing in Dari] [Pooya in Dari] [tense music playing] [Pooya speaking] -[Basira speaking Dari] -[speaking Dari] [Pooya continues] [Basira responds in Dari] [gun clicks] -[distant gunfire] -[people screaming] [Pooya speaking] [Ahmed speaking in Dari] [Pooya speaking] [Ahmed speaking] [baby crying] [Pooya speaking] [Ahmed speaking] [Pooya speaking] [muffled struggling] [knife slashes] [distant gunfire] [Basira whimpers] -[banging on door] -[Taliban members shouting] [baby crying] [Pooya speaking] [door thuds, opens] [Taliban members shouting] [speaks Dari] [Taliban members chattering] [Pooya speaking] -[gunfire] -[Taliban members shouting] [man speaking Dari] -[man] Mornin', boss. -Mornin'. [drilling] I could only find three of these. I swear there's two more around here. [mechanic] All right. [Caroline] So, you know where to find us if there's a problem. -[woman] Great. Thank you. -Pleasure doing business with you. [woman] Bye. Mr. Kinley. [John] Mrs. Kinley. Looks like you've got everything under control. Mm-hmm. The Cadillac will be ready this afternoon. and the Harleys will be picked up at six o'clock. [sighs] Guess you don't need me then. Nope. [sighs] But you sure look purty. I'm gonna go... put on something sexy. [sighs] I know and have accepted what you do, John. We've had this conversation many times. I've said goodbye to you, not knowing if I'm going to see you again. And I've been doing this for 12 years. But this time, it's different. This family believed that you were dead. We suffered this news for three weeks. Do you know what the children and I went through? But you have put me in an impossible position. Being your wife is one thing, but being their mother, it's... it's something else. We owe that man your life. So, we will remortgage the house, you'll get those visas, and you will go. And you will do what you have to. You'll come back alive. You'll come back alive, John Kinley. [plane whirring] [knocking on door] [door closes] Colonel. Declan. John, please, have a seat. Everything all right, John? No, everything's not all right. Have a seat. I'd rather stand, if you don't mind. So, you seem to have been making a lot of noise lately. [John on recording] What's your fucking name? Huh? -[man] Sergeant, there is no-- -[John] What's your name? -[man] It's First Officer Cowell. -[John] I will come to your fucking house, and I will find you! [man] Sergeant, please calm down. [John] There's a fucking man stuck in a goddamn cave! [man] Sir, I assure you, we're doing everything we can. [John] Fuckin' hole and... There's been a, uh, official complaint. Oh, I see. You brought me here for an intervention. Or to slap my wrist. That's not why I'm here. You think if I could be shot of this debt, I wouldn't be? Do you think if I could just go through the usual channels, I wouldn't? That is not how this debt works. It demands a result, not an appeasement. There is a hook in me. One that you cannot see. But it is there. And you think I have a choice? There is no fuckin' choice. I am going to get that man and his family out of the position that we put him in. And of that, I have no doubt. And you're gonna help me, Colonel. The reason that I am here... I saved your life eight years ago. So you're gonna get those visas. I don't know how. But you're gonna get them. Because I know you are the type of man that pays his debts. [somber instrumental music playing] Pay your debts. [door opens] [door shuts] I love you both so much. [girl] I'm gonna miss you, Daddy. [boy] I'm gonna miss you. [John] I'll miss you, too. Okay. [sighs] We are gonna miss you, John. I know. I'll be back in a week. Come here. Kiss me. [somber music intensifies] [helicopter whirring] Ron Kay? Vokes' man? Parker, yeah? -Yeah. -I hear good things. [John] So, we set? [Parker] Well, I've contacted Ahmed's brother, Ali. He says he's found the village that Ahmed's at, but he's had no contact directly yet. So, we're goin' to the brother? Yeah, well, that was the plan. Was? We've been pulled away to do another job. We have a contract, Parker. We have an agreement. And I need you to honor it. This outranks me. It comes from the top. We got a UN diplomat, got his detail in hot water, we gotta deal with it. That's all there is to it. Listen, you hold up here for three days, my team's all yours. That's not how this contract works, brother. In three days, a warm body turns cold. And I know it's not ten million dollars, but you said, "Yes." And I'm two pints of blood and a 150k in the hole. Well, Ron, if you're not happy, you can take your money back. Oh, no, I'm definitely not fuckin' happy. I don't want the money. I want you to honor the fuckin' deal. I hear you have an impressive team. Now I need you to back yourself. [chuckles softly] All right, listen. Let's, uh... compromise, shall we? If you can find Ahmed and his family, call us with the location, we'll come in, airlift you out, get you back to base, put you on the next transport home. Done. [slaps leg] You just gotta find him. I see how this works. I pay you so I can wash the car. Come on, man. You know how to adapt. Use what you got, and this is what you got. Now, you can wait three days, you get the full magazine. Or you can go now, but you're goin' solo. I'll set you up. I'll give you four good wheels and a full set of tools, but you're gonna be alone. There's $10,000 cash and a sat phone. You got an M-4 in the trunk, with six magazines. You got a full tank of gas, satnav address that's gonna take you to Ali. You can touch base with him first. Ron, it's 72 hours. If I was you, I'd wait. Yeah, but you're not me. Are you, Parker? [engine starts] [dramatic music playing] [men shouting indistinctly] [Taliban members shouting in Dari] [indistinct chatter] [man speaking Dari] [in English] John! John, come in. [Ali speaking German] [in English] Sit down, please. Please sit down. Relax. [speaking German] [in English] Just a second. [speaking German] Hassan! [sighs] [in English] You want some tea? [speaking Dari] [in English] Do you know what John means in my country? [speaking Dari] [in English] My dear. My love. My brother told me about your beautiful blue eyes. You have beautiful blue eyes. Ahmed's son also had beautiful blue eyes. Cigarette? [chair scrapes loudly] [sighs] [inhales] [exhales] The only reason I haven't been tortured about the location of my brother, is because I do a lot of business with the Taliban. I guess you know what I'm doing for a living, right? Yeah, I think I understand. [Ali] Hmm. You also understand my brother has become very unpopular with my partners. They don't like the fact that the story of your rescue has become so famous. Well, that's why I'm here. I... I feel bad about that. I owe your brother my life. If you can give me the location of your brother I can get him out of the country. [exhales] Is that your truck there? You can't take that. It's too dangerous. I organized some transport. There's my truck driver, his name is Pooya. He has a pass to get him through the Taliban checkpoints. However, sometimes, they can be still difficult. When was the last time you talked to your brother? [exhales] A week ago. And he's due to move in two days. But this is his last chance. The price on his head is too great now. Good luck, John Kinley. [in Dari] [man speaking Dari] [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [men conversing in Dari] Stay hidden. Stay hidden! [Taliban member speaking Dari] [in Dari] [vehicles honking] [conversing in Dari] It's okay. Checkpoint! Checkpoint! [in Dari] [engine stops] [Pooya grunting] [Pooya muttering in Dari] [man speaking Dari] [silenced gunshots] [gunshots echo] [gunshots echo continues] You good? [Pooya] I thought we were dead. Let's get him outta here. [body thuds] [in Dari] [Commander Satar on phone] [engine starts] [tense music playing] [phone rings] [Vokes on phone] John? John, it's Vokes. I got the visas. Whole family. I'm having them delivered to Parker. -Good man. -John. Good luck, brother. [engine stops] We are here. [man on radio] Red 6, this is Red 1, got you Lima Charlie... [John over phone] Ron for Parker. Boss, it's for you. It's Ron Kay. -Red 6, good copy. -Ron. Result? Parker, I found him. Tracking your location now. You make contact? No. But I am looking at him right now. Uh, got his location now, sir. All right, we got you. Yeah, just wait a second. Nearest extraction point is Darunta Dam, two kilometers due east from where you stand now. -Darunta Dam. Got it. -All right, call us back when you got your man, his family, and you're en route. You'll have a two-hour window from that point, all right? Uh, yeah, one more thing, Parker, um... We don't have much time. I left a messy trail. All right, we'll make a call. See if we can get some eyes up. Go get your boy. [dogs barking in distance] A lot of dogs around here. I like your outfit. And I like what you've done with your hair. Must've been quite challenging to find me. Eh. I can get you and your family outta here. We just have to leave now. Now? [clears throat] That's a shame. I like it here. [John] Mmm. [sighs] Mmm. I can see why. Yes. [ominous music playing] [man on phone speaking Dari] -[speaking Dari] -Fakhrudin? [Parker] Yeah, what is it, Joe? Ron Kay. [Parker] What about him? Yeah, I thought he looked familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. So, I ran him through the system and our intel shows he's on the Talib's most-wanted list. He's on a list? Why is he on a list? Oh, fuck me. "Ron Kay", that... that's John Kinley. Why didn't he tell us that before? [in Dari] [Parker] I think if John Kinley is popular with the Talib, then Ahmed is the fattest fuckin' pig in the pen. Let's turn this thing around. -Cody, get Bagram on the line, now! -[Cody] Yes, sir. They're gonna want in on this, and we wanna get an Angel in the air. -You two, get the drone footage up right now. -[man] On it! At last, gonna get my boots dirty. [baby gurgling] [Ahmed] Basira. [speaking in Dari] John? [speaking Dari] [replying in Dari] [breathes shakily] [in English] We have to go now. [suspenseful music playing] [Taliban members speaking Dari] [speaking in Dari] [satellite phone beeping] [in Dari] [shouting indistinctly] [speaking in Dari] [suspenseful music intensifies] I can see the dam. Taliban trucks! Taliban trucks! [baby crying] [shouting in Dari] [John] Pooya, block the tunnel. [shouting in Dari] [baby crying continuously] [Pooya speaking Dari] [Taliban members shouting orders] [Ahmed speaking Dari] -[gunshots] -[John] Move! [John] Come on! [yelling] Move, move, move, move, move! [gunfire echoing] Move, move, move! [Ahmed] Cover, cover, cover! [John yelling] Go, go! To the building, to the building! [Basira crying out] Ahmed! [John] Covering! [indistinct shouting] [John] Crap! Motherfuckers! -Cover me. -[Ahmed] Get down. [John] Fuck! Shit! -[Ahmed] Go, go, go! -[screaming] [John] Down! [cries out] Fuck! [screams] -[Ahmed] Get down! -Argh! I'm almost out. [exclaims] Ah, shit! I'm out! Come on, Parker! -[baby crying] -[sobs] [grunts] Where the fuck are you, Parker? [Taliban members shouting] -[gun clicks] -Shit. Shit. I'm out. [shouting indistinctly] [voices slow down] [somber orchestral music playing] [muffled baby crying] [yelps] [music fades] [sound muted] [muffled explosion] [muffled taliban members shouting] [sound resumes] [bullet casings jingle] [over radio] Identifying multiple targets, west end of the dam. [operator 1 over radio] Go in hot on the 105. I have visual, 0-6-0. [operator 2 over radio] Copy that, Spectre 3-7. They are clear. [pilot] Copy that. [dramatic music playing] [man over radio] All tangos down? [operator 1] Confirmed. Off the trigger. FOB 2, this is Spectre 3-7, we are all clear. [helicopter approaching] Everyone all right? Bradley, Mike, get him up and in the air. -[man] Yes, sir. -[groaning in pain] [Parker] You know, if you'd have told me that you were John Kinley, and he's the Ahmed, you'd have got this whole thing on me, pal. These are from Vokes. Visas for Ahmed, his wife, the kid. All right, this is gonna take you back to base. There's a transport airplane waiting back there. It's gonna take you home. Parker. Kinley. Pleasure doin' business with you. You backed yourself. Ahmed, good work. You need anything, you look me up.
