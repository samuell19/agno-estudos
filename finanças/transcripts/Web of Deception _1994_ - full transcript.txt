[HORN HONKING] [TRAIN CHUGGGING] [BELL DINGING] MAN: He's got to be a pretty good guy. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know this doctor well. He's one of the great voices of forensic psychiatry today. Dr. Philip Benesch. How about a nice handclap? [APPLAUDING] [APPLAUDING CONTINUES] PHILIP: Thank you. The public is very angry with the abuse in our court system where heinous crimes are committed and excused because of a plea of temporary insanity. Because their parents or their spouses or their friends or society made them do it. But the point to me is there are evil people in the world who do terrible things. And we have to run it. How do we draw the line for individual responsibility? Yo, I'm your fan, doc. Yeah, right. You were great. Congratulations. All right. Congratulations. Thanks for coming. Hello. Sheila, what are you doing here? I came to see McLeod. I enjoyed your speech. I disagree though. PHILIP: Well... You ready to get out of here? Yes. [BELL DINGING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] So, what did you think? How did I do? It was fine. No, really. An A, B+, or... You gave a very good speech. Yeah? I thought it went well. [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] How's she doing? Thanks for asking. I'll see you soon. GIRL: Good night! [DOOR CREAKS] Are you all right? What's this? I found it on the floor of the closet. It must've fallen out of one of your jackets. [SIGHING RUEFULLY] It's over. It's been over for five months now. I haven't seen her-- But you saw her tonight, didn't you? That was her, wasn't it? The black Chanel number? She came with Neil McLeod. It was just a coincidence. Look, it didn't mean anything-- It didn't mean anything? I know that it meant. You wanna know what I hate most? That you've made me feel like some kind of stupid cliche. You wanna talk about it? No. I don't think I wanna talk about it. Talking is your department. If we talk about it now, I'm sure everything will get twisted around and we'll both end up agreeing the affair was my fault. Hey. Now, I'm not gonna upset the girls by having you sleep somewhere else But you don't touch me. Do you understand? [WIND BLOWING] [KIDS CHATTERING] Pass! Pass! WOMAN: Over here. Come on! [SIREN WAILING] [WOMEN CHATTERING] WOMAN: I'm open, I'm open. Come on! [SWISHES] [BASKETBALL BOUNCING] Forgot how good you are. Well, I could always take you on. Your problem was, you could never admit I was better. Oh, you're better than me at a lot of things. I want you. I want us to work. Even before we were married? Like she flashed in my brain one day. Believe half of what he says and most of what he does. Why'd you even marry me? Love is a many-splendored thing. [SIGHING GRIMLY] It seems I've made you cynical. But could you just try to work this thing out with me? I keep picturing you with her. Thinking of all the lies and the arrangements. It won't happen again. [BALL BOUNCING] Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once. Were there any others? No. I'll try. And you knew I would all along. I'll see you at home. [WHISTLES] Well, well, here he is. Psychiatrist from heaven. Detective Fracinetti. You know, doc, I've been reading up on Freud. Good for you. You explain it to me someday. Yeah, I'll do that. You testifying this morning? What, testifying? No. We're here for the college boy. [EXCLAIMING SMUGLY] [CHUCKLING] What a jerk. Yeah, well, he's our jerk though. So you agree Mr. Hogesh hears voices. From time to time, yes. And if I understand you correctly, your position is even though Mr. Hogesh hears voices, a symptom of acute psychosis, you think he's sane enough to die in the electric chair? Many psychotics hear voices telling them to kill. Very few kill. On the basis of tests and interviews, I believe Mr. Hogesh knew the difference between right and wrong when he planted those bombs. So, the fact that he's hearing voices is irrelevant. To be legally sane, you only have to understand that what you're doing is wrong. PHILIP: I'm convinced Mr. Hogesh knew that. WOMAN: It's okay. They can't see you. You take your time. Just take a deep breath. What do you think? [WHISPERS] WOMAN: [OVER RADIO] Step forward, number three, please. Good. It's okay. You did good. [SIGHS SOFTLY] WOMAN: [OVER RADIO] Step back. WOMAN: What do you think, doctor? Oh, he's 41 or 42, married, two children, works as a construction crew chief or something blue-collar, owns a shotgun and a 30 odd six, drives an American car. Sounds just like me. [ALARM BUZZES] So, how did I do? Forty five. No 30 odd six. [CHUCKLING] WOMAN: It's just two nights ago, Earl. Why can't you remember? Because you're making me nervous. Dragging me out of bed. Dragging me out here for a lineup? The type of thing I've never been in my entire life? Implicating I'm some kind of killer. Who said anything about being a killer, Earl? You know the TV was full with what you found out there day before yesterday on that river. WOMAN: Well, we found out there were coat fibers matching your jacket-- Oh, bull! Look, if you're charging me with being out there for some kind of reason, I want a lawyer present. I'm saying that in front of everybody here. I want a lawyer. Then I guess we better get you a lawyer, Earl. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Hi. Are you Dr. Benesch? Yes. Do I know you? I was transcribing in the interview room. I know you from being a minor functionary than a stenographer in the court system. Corrie Calvin. I saw you notice him crack his knuckles. Ah, what do you think I made of that, Ms. Calvin? Well, he only did it when he denied something. CORRIE: When he was being indignant is more accurate. I didn't notice at first. It was only after I saw you noticing that I concluded there was a pattern. But who wouldn't be nervous under that kind of stress? PHILIP: Exactly. See, that's the danger with presuming guilt based on one interview. Everyone's afraid of the police. Everyone but you, huh? That's because I work with them. I get to see them as human beings. Well... Nice to talk to you. GIRL: Give it to me! Give me the Teddy bear! Yes, now. ELLEN: Okay. I've had enough. No, no. I told you, if you did this again, you're gonna go upstairs. Hey! Hey Daddy. Megan gets a kiss. Hi, honey. Hi. You know that maths test you helped me study for? Yeah? Got an A. Oh, great. Hi, sweetheart. How was your day? Complex. I think we got a suspect in the Russian river case. Good! Dad, when's our next vacation? [PHONE RINGING] Why don't you get that? Yeah. Some creep's been calling and hanging up. ELLEN: I think it's a good time for everybody to go upstairs and do their homework. Go on now. [PHONE RINGING] Philip Benesch. PHILIP: Hello? Who is this? [HANGS UP] Did they hang up when you answered? Maybe it wasn't me they wanted. Well, they probably won't call again. You know, when they hear a man's voice. [RAIN PATTERING] Did you think there was some woman calling for me? No! Why would you say that? Well, it had to cross my mind. It wasn't. Okay. I thought were gonna try to work this thing out. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I know. I love you. [SIGHS WEARILY] [BUZZING] Hey, doc. Look. They want him moved to the bridge before we complete our interviews. Police have to just keep him put here another week. They didn't promise you anything. You'll realize as you go on. This guy's cut seven women. We don't want some judge sending him to psychiatry before we could nail him! I said, we'll see. MAN: Why'd you try to hurt yourself, Earl? I was afraid on account of what I know you people can do. So, when Bob said, "Do it," I cut myself. No fear, no pain. [CHUCKLING] What else did Bob tell you to do? That's for me to know and you to find out? [EARL CHUCKLING] You're the one in touch with Bob. I'm not. EARL: You're a loser, man. You see this guy? He's a loser. EARL: Who's this? How'd you look with a smile across your neck? [SCREAMING] Who're you people sending me? It's not enough you're wrecking me? [SCREAMING] EARL: [SCREAMING] No! [SCREAMING] No! [SCREAMING] Oh, God! [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Since you asked, I think Mr. Stage is borderline. She says annoyingly... with a healthy dose of self-hate thrown in. And don't ask me why, but, I'm convinced he was sexually abused as a child. By the way, I loved when you said, "You're in touch with Bob. I'm not." How do you know so much about abnormal psychology, Corrie? Both my parents were analysts at Wisconsin. I was supposed to be one too but I ended up a patient. Amazingly typical, n'est ce pas? Anyway, after I got out of Radcliffe I kind of petered out of the occupational world. San Francisco was part of my see-America-first program. I fell into this job because of my immense typing skills. [CHUCKLES] But what's really interesting is what you do. Forensic psychiatry. I remember in your paper, "Healing and Deception" You read "Healing and Deception"? Yes, I did. Your thesis that false cure was the flip side of the coin of false illness. I never thought of that. I'm... I'm married, Corrie. I can't, uh... I'm married. Everybody is. I gotta go. I gotta go meet my wife. Uh... PHILIP: We're both busy, so we grab time on every weekend. Nice to see you. [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hello, Corrie. Hi. Fancy meeting you here. Well, not fancy. [CHUCKLES] I was working late. On our friend Earl. I had nothing better to do so I thought I'd get some air. What's the point living in the bay area if you can't get air? N'est ce pas? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Well... Oh, good night. See you tomorrow. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Ellen. [TAPE WHIRRING] CORRIE: [OVER ANSWERING MACHINE] Are you home, dear doctor? Here's a funny coincidence. I always knew I'd fall in love with someone I could call, "Dear Doctor." Because that's what people used to call my father. I can smell the wood burning, as you think "Oedipus complex." Don't be mad at me. Your little Rita Clerambault can help me. Rita Clerambault. Corrie. Hi. Did I wake you? [DOOR OPENS] Got it? Where's your lunch? I'll get it. Wendy, look! Who're they for, Alex? I don't know! "To the real Dr. B, "from a secret admirer." Ooh, la, la. Way to go, Dad. What? From you? No. ALEX: Who sent them? ALEX: Who sent them, Dad? I don't know, but we gotta go to school because we're gonna be late. So, let's rush, rush, rush. [ENGINE REVVING] [GONGS SOUNDING] ELLEN: So, who is she, Philip? This court reporter I work with. She's apparently infatuated with me. Is there something going on? Because if there is, please have the decency to tell me. If there is, it is completely one-sided. I can tell you that. Just trust me, will you? If you let it low, it'll go away. [SIGHS WEARILY] Why do they all become infatuated with you? [LAUGHS] It has nothing to do with me. [WINGS FLAPPING] The very fact that he attempted suicide indicates diminished capacity. WITNESS: I doubt Mr. Stage can appreciate the difference between right and wrong or helpful and unhelpful. Thank you, Dr. Sanford. Dr. Sanford always says the same thing. ATTORNEY: No questions, your honor. We call Dr. Philip Benesch. Wouldn't the extreme nature of a suicide attempt indicate an unbalanced mental state? Not necessarily. PHILIP: And definitely not, in this case. Mr. Stage is... Mr. Stage is coherent. He answers questions logically. And he can tell the difference between right and wrong. He may not be medically sane, but if he is having fantasies, they in no way interfere with his cognitive processes. So, he can stand trial. Mr. Lake. MR. LAKE: Dr. Benesch, what do you make of the fact that the defendant was incarcerated in a state mental hospital for most of his adolescence? When Mr. Stage was growing up, mental hospitals often warehoused difficult children. But he was diagnosed paranoid psychotic by his doctors. Diagnostic procedures have changed considerably in the last 20 years. That he claims to be in touch with an alter-ego named Bob who tells him quote, "to do things." In my opinion, A, Bob is a fabrication. B, even if he is real to Mr. Stage, that in no way interferes with his ability to comprehend the real world. What would he have to do before you'll say he can't comprehend the real world? MR. LAKE: Walk on his head and talk Urdu? Here we have a man who has been diagnosed! ATTORNEY: Objection! JUDGE: Sustained! JUDGE: Save that for your summation, Mr. Lake. MR. LAKE: Well, score one for your team. PHILIP: I thought he was legally sane. MR. LAKE: Yeah, right. MR. LAKE: So is it rabbit or squirrel? You know, what gets me is you get two expert witnesses, forty years experience between them. One says, "A." The other, "Z." Defendants' at the mercy of one wearing a more convincing... PHILIP: Ah, bet you can say the same thing about lawyers. Lawyers try to discover the truth. Philip. They don't have to know it. Dr. Prosser, how are you? Good. It's good to see you. Are you on a case? Yeah. Several. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Well, Phil, I'll see you later. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, Philip. We have got to find a way to talk to another. What do you mean? We are talking. Oh, that is such crap! People around here don't know anything about us. You just draw attention to the awkwardness when you behave so formally. Let's talk like friends Oh, Sheila. Sheila, look. Look, it's just that... Things are difficult for me right now. I'm just trying to normalize it all. Does she really want to be married to you? I want to be married to her. For me? Hope that's not a subpoena. Ah, me too. Ms. Calvin? Ms. Calvin. Got a minute? Sixteen to be exact. I'm all yours. They wanted $15 for the returned check for 11/81. I asked them why they didn't just take the 319 from my credit line if they're gonna take the 15 from there if I honored the check? I wished you were there to help me. Corrie, do you own a white Honda Accord? But I wanted a Jaguar. Were you the one parked on my street this morning that delivered the flowers to my doorstep? Hope there's a right answer. Did you leave a message on my answering machine last night as Rita Clerambault? Shocking liberties. CORRIE: Will you forgive her? It upsets my wife when you do things like that. Frankly, I don't understand why you are doing it. We... We hardly know one another. Oh, it's just admiration bordering on love. [CHUCKLING] You can't be serious. CORRIE: If you meet and just know... I knew the minute I saw you in the hall with that Italian detective. Long before we worked together. I could've, well, you know, if one didn't believe in kismet, one might've tried to make something happen. I knew there were stronger forces that would bring us together. So, how do you think I feel about you, Corrie? Go ahead. Put me on the spot. Want me to tell you? [GLASS BREAKING] PHILIP: I'm kinda getting the feeling that you want something from me that I just can't give you. Look, I love my wife very much. I'm not looking for anyone else. Oh, well, it's still new to you. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Ms. Calvin. I'm gonna put you in contact with another psychiatrist. His name is Mike Dann. He's a good man. I think he can help you. Go see him. In the meantime, I... I want you to stop writing me, stop calling me, stop all contact with me. Well, it was thoughtless... I tend to go too fast sometimes. It won't happen again. The problem is, love is blind. You haven't understood a thing I've said to you, have you? I don't want you to bother me anymore. Don't write, don't call, don't follow me. If you want help, I'll help you. Otherwise, just leave me alone. I'm always paying on the go. Doesn't the man ever rest? [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] You didn't sleep with her, and she's not paranoid. Uh, she knows what she is. She left a message on my answering machine as Rita Clerambault. Clerambault? The guy who did the first work on erotomania? She she's an erotomaniac from hell sent here to punish you for your sins. Ellen would see it like that. Not for those sins. For finding every poor bastard who talks to God sane. Legally, most of them are. And so is she. But you can't lock her up, so you want me to see her. Okay. What's her name? How can I make an appointment if I don't know her name? Corrie. PHILIP: Corrie Calvin. Like John Calvin? MIKE: Oh, brother. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] [CALVIN'S VOICE ON ANSWERING MACHINE] Hi! Leave a message. [BEEPS] PHILIP: Ms. Calvin. I spoke to Dr. Dann. He's expect to hear from you. So, please call him. [HANGS UP] [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [KIDS LAUGHING] [CHATTERING] Hey, girls, go out to the Patio, all right? I want everybody out. We don't want to wreck the surprise. Are you almost ready? The neighbors are right there. Yes, yes, yes. I just have to wipe the candles. I'll be there. Just get everybody ready. ELLEN: No more kids in the house. Come on, girls! All right, grab what you want and go. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'll get it. Is this the Benesch household? Um, yeah. You got it. I am the singing rabbit. And I have a delivery for one Ms. Alex Benesch. Yes, she right in here. Come on in. WENDY: Alex! Happy birthday! [CHEERING AND CLAMORING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAMORING] ALEX: Aw. ELLEN: Oh, sweetie. Thanks. Oh, honey. Wendy can you get me some towels? Please help us with this. Let's go to the kitchen and clean this up. ELLEN: Oh, dear. Get the hell away from my house. It's all right. I can call Veneto's and order in another one. [GROANS] I don't know. It just slipped out of my hands. I gotta go apologize to Alex. Hey, Wendy. Yeah, that's good, sweetie. Could I have a towel here? Doc, I read your report. It's great. We're gonna fire this bastard. I just wrote what I found. Exactly. It's gonna fry, doc. We've gotta stop meeting like this. What the hell do you think you're doing, Ms. Calvin? You may be malicious, just plain delusional but whatever it is, you stay away from me and my family. Do you understand me? [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] You pull stuff like that again, I'll get a restraining order against you. I have, not now, or ever been, interested in this little game of yours. You take it somewhere else. [SIGHS WEARILY] [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello? Hello? Is Dr. Benesch there? No, he's not in right now. Could I take a message? No, thanks. I'll call back. [HANGS UP] Oh, well. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLICKS] [WATER FLOWING] [VALVE CLOSES] [TEARS] [TEARS] [FLUSHES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [RATTLING] Well... Aren't you ever gonna go... [GUNSHOT] [CREAKS] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] MAN: [YELLING] I know, I know. I'll check it out. WOMAN: Check from inside! You okay in here? WOMAN: Call the police. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [TRAIN CHUGGING] PHILIP: Well, absolutely nothing. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You see, when someone creates a heinous crime, we think that it is so bad the person necessarily must have been insane to create it. All right? Right. Wrong! [STUDENTS LAUGHING] PHILIP:Well, Fracinetti. I didn't see your name on the list for my class. FRACINETTI: Well, no. But I learned a lot from you. Do you know Detective Geer? How do you do? How do you do? You got a minute? Yeah, sure. We want to ask you a few questions about Corrie Calvin. Considering her psychological disposition? Yes, and no. How well did you know her, doctor? Not at all, really. She took transcription for me with Earl Stage. What do you mean, "Did?" Were you sleeping with her? What kind of question is that? I just told you I didn't know her. She left a diary. What do you mean, "Left"? It was very explicit about sex with you. Pages and pages. If you did half the stuff she said you did, doc, you should be in Playboy Advisor or something. [CLEARS THROAT] Look. Corrie's an erotomaniac. That's someone who fantasizes relationships that don't exist. They pick an object, in this case, me, create a universe that's coherent except that it's completely imagined. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I never touched Corrie Calvin. So, you never slept with her? I would have to touch her to do that, now, wouldn't I? Why are you asking me all this? One more question. Where were you between eight and ten last night? I said, why are you asking me-- That's when she was murdered, doc. Murdered? Now, wait a minute. Who was murdered? Corrie. Helen doesn't know you like I know you. Corrie Calvin was murdered? How? By who? She was shot. So, if you have some place that you can verify, that'd be great. I was... I was with a friend who has a report. And you can verify that, right? FRACINETTI: Good. Thank you. I think our minute's up. And we'll be on our way. If we need you, we'll be in touch. Good to see you. Thanks. Thank you. What'd you stop me for? Well, we got plenty of time. Here you go, sir. Thanks, Mike. I assume you heard about Corrie. The cops woke me up at 5 a.m. They talk about me? It's all they talk about. Who is this Helen Geer? I told her I didn't give a damn what kind of physical evidence they found in the room but you didn't kill anybody. Oh, wait a minute. They actually implied that I might have killed her? They believe that? They'd sooner tell you that then me, buddy. I wouldn't talk to her. Not without a court order. I'm not sure what's going on here. How do you mean? The cops think it's a homicide. Where were you last night, Phil? Huh? Just in case. Uh, I was at a friend's. Have Fracinetti call me when he gets in, will you? Philip Benesch. Right. Thank you. [RAIN PATTERING] [ROARING PLAYFULLY] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Good night, sweetie. Love you. Love you too. WENDY: Good night, Mom. Good night. Dad. ELLEN: Remember to brush your teeth! [GROANS] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Is everything all right at work? You seem tired. I'm not that tired. [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] NEWSREPORTER ON TV: Good evening, it's 9 'o clock. Maybe we should take this upstairs. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Good idea. Her body has been found in her apartment. Police are searching for clues. I'm Connie Colla. Join us for these stories and more coming up on the news at eleven. [CLICKS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR OPENS] I'll be right with you, Mr. George. [DOOR OPENS] What the hell are you doing coming here, Fracinetti? I'd like to know where you were between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on February 8th. Oh, is this an official visit? If it is, I already told you what I know about-- Your fingerprints are in her room. I was never in her room. On a coffee cup. We also found traces of blood on her hands which matches your own. Her will was made out to you. There was a letter to your wife under the kitchen linoleum detailing your affair. This is crazy. Look. Call Mike Dann, will you? After I realized she was following me, I referred her to him. He can tell you how disturbed she was. Could you tell us where you were, doctor? I was... I was at Dr. Sheila Prosser's apartment. She can verify that? No. Someone left a message on my answering machine asking me to meet Dr. Prosser at her apartment on the night of the eighth. But, she never arrived. There was another message saying she had been called for an emergency. Did she leave the messages, doc? No. Did you save the messages? No, I had no reason to. How did you get into her apartment. I have a key. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a patient waiting. [DOOR OPENS] So, you think she set you up? [SCOFFS] I feel like I'm in a Kafka novel. To deny something that never happened. All my friends are my enemies, and my enemies... Not the way it really ends. Gee, Phil, there's lots of lawyers out there. Why not call one of them? I don't know. I've never called the criminal attorney before. It's the last thing I've imagined having to do. I guess I called you because I know you. Oh, hell, I'll just give you the advice I always give anyone. Don't talk to them without a lawyer. Why would she do this to me? They already have plenty of evidence to arrest you. If it was anyone else, you'd have been arrested. I hardly know this woman. She had no reason-- Look, I gotta run. If you want to retain me, you can. If not, I'll recommend someone. [SIGHS WEARILY] Hey! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. How was your day, Sweetie? Fine. Good. All right. Let's get your seat belts on. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE REVVING] So you girls just settle down and stay here in the car. What are they doing here, Dad? I'll go find out. Quiet, Alex. [CRYING] Alex, can't you see something's happening? PHILIP: What's going on? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What the hell are you doing in my house? Could we talk over there, Dr. Benesch? I'll remember your department. Why are you searching my house? At least have the courtesy to tell me what's going on. Who the hell do you think you are? You're under arrest, doctor. Ah, this is ridiculous. You know I didn't kill her. ALEX: What's going on? Dad? Girls, come here. Come here. Philip. We don't want to handcuff you in front of your wife, so I want you to sit here, right here and not make a sound until I'm through. [YELLING] Nothing. Not a sound! [SIGHING IN EXHAUSTION] Uh, it's kinda confusing right now, all right? So, I want you two to go upstairs. Just go upstairs. And I'll come up and try to explain what's happening. Okay? [SCOFFS] Look. COP: Yeah, I'll be down in a second. Philip, what is going on? I don't know how this whole stuff happened. It's like some kind of bad dream. [BUZZING] I talked to Lake, and he said they have a very strong case against you. It's just circumstantial. He's afraid he can't get you bail. We'll make bail. Don't worry. Don't worry? This is murder we're talking about. I didn't kill her! Look, we've known each other more than half our lives. You cannot believe that I killed this woman. You and your damn secrets. [SIGHS WEARILY] How're the kids handling everything? They're not talking right now. Well, uh... Look, this is what I think you ought to do. Oh, no. No, don't. Don't you tell me how to deal with the kids. You're not in a position to be giving me orders. I'm not giving you orders. I'm just concerned-- You're concerned? I'm the one who has to deal with them. You're not the only one affected by this. [BUZZING] OFFICER: Time's up. You gotta go. Philip, I'm sorry. Um... I'm gonna get the kids settled, and then I'll... I'll see what I can do. [DOOR CLOSES] [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Hey. Hey! You can't put him in here. There are no spies allowed in here. Bye, spy! It's not easy here! I have a camera in my brain! It's gonna come! I need a gun to kill! [SCREAMING] God! [BUZZING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Could you do something for him? Tranquilize him or something? [SCREAMING] Anybody hear that man? He needs some help! [SCREAMING] Oh, doc! [DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] EARL: [SCREAMING] I'm gonna die! Have a seat. This way. JUDGE: People vs. Philip Benesch MD one count 1113. Is Mr. Lake representing you? I am, your honor. How do you plead? Not guilty, your honor. And who's trying the case? I am, your honor. We ask no bail. This is a capital offense with premeditation. MR. LAKE: Your honor, Dr. Benesch poses no threat to himself or to others. and including Ms. Rospel Hammon whom he worked with for seven years until yesterday. The entire court community knows Dr. Benesch. They can vouch for his past reliability. Your honor. JUDGE: No, I agree with Mr. Lake, counselor. I'm setting bail in this case at $500,000. JUDGE: Next. [BUZZING] [SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [BUZZING] Sorry. I got held up. You okay. [SIGHS WEARILY] MR. LAKE: Where do you wanna go? Is Ellen at your office? No, she didn't make it. Why not? The kids are pretty upset. But she said they'll call. Les? Yeah, this is Leslie White. She's my second. She'll take notes as we go along. You want some coffee? They feed you? Yeah, coffee would be great. Just one. MR. LAKE: So, the murder weapon was in your name. What? She was killed with your gun. Any idea how she might've gotten it? PHILIP: No, I... I kept it in my desk at my office. They recovered traces of your blood in her hands underneath her fingernails. They, uh, found her apartment full of memorabilia devoted to you which suggest to them that you knew each other well. Were they personal photographs? Yeah, a couple. What photographs? You were seen in each other's company, bla bla bla... We got coffee once or twice for lunch. Yes, unimportant. Okay. You claim that you were at Sheila Prosser's apartment the night of the murder but she can't verify. She said she didn't invite you. Is that true? She didn't make the call. Did you save any messages? Now, why would I do that? Why would I give myself an alibi that I knew wouldn't hold up? I mean, if I killed her, I wouldn't had said anything that I knew would be contradictory Now, wouldn't I? Look, I gotta tell you. I think Corrie had a history of harassing people. Corrie has no history. What do you mean no history? Just that. She doesn't exist before 1990. No name, no social security, no nothing. So, what about the blood? [SCOFFS] I don't know. Also, your fingerprints were found in her apartment on a coffee cup. Does the cup match the ones in Corrie's cupboard? Yep. If the coffee cup matches the one from the restaurant where we had lunch, maybe she stole it and bought a set. PHILIP: I gotta tell you. I think she planned this thing very deliberately. I'll say. Well, so far, we'll say she stole your gun, your blood, your fingerprints. Now, here's what they'll say. You're having an affair with Corrie. She threatened to tell your wife. She wouldn't listen when you begged her not to, you know Ellen would leave you if she found out about Corrie, so you killed Corrie to save your marriage and your reputation. Well, that all makes perfect sense, doesn't it? Except it is not true. True? What's true? The important thing is, it'll play. [RAIN PATTERING] [SIGHS WEARILY] [DIAL TONE] [SNIFFLES] [DIGITAL BEEPING] [PHONE RINGING] ELLEN: [OVER PHONE] Hello? Yeah, hi, it's me. Hi. You okay? [SIGHS GRIMLY] I'm okay. Really? I miss you. How're the kids? [SIGHS] They're upset. Look, tell 'em I'm, uh... I'm sorry that they've been hurt by all this. Okay? I know. They need to talk to you, you know? Can I see you? Well, maybe... Maybe you could come out down Saturday. Philip? Philip? What? Yeah, yeah. I'm still here. Uh... Saturday. Saturday. I'll see you, Sweetie. Bye. [HANGS UP] [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PLACES PHONE RECEIVER] [TEARS] MAN: Hey, buddy. You busy? [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] On the contrary. All my patients seem to have the flu. Come on in. Phil, you made a bad mistake sending the cops to me. Yeah? Why's that? They subpoenaed the file. There was a letter from you in it? I never wrote to her! A love letter. I hated like hell to give it to them but I had to. Was there a heading, "Dear Corrie? If there was, we'll prove she forged it. No, there was something else. Photograph. She brought it in to prove you were having an affair. I could kick myself for not destroying it. I don't know why the hell I didn't. Hey, Phil, where're you going? She had to have stolen the stuff from you. How? How would she even know about them? I don't know. She'd do anything. Uh... Look, people knew we were having an affair. They're all here. There were only nine. Are you positive? Would you like to count them? The photos are all here too. At least the ones I can remember. Where were you the night we were supposed to meet? The night Corrie was killed. I told the police already. I was with a suicidal patient in a bar. Somebody new. I hadn't been seeing her for very long. How old was she? Mid twenties? Anything odd about her? Yeah, her hair. It was a wig. A wig. [SCOFFS] You think the patient... Oh, my God. And the bar was that little place around the corner block? The Eldridge Arms. Her name was June Lord. Missed her last two appointments. She thought of everything. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Excited to see your daddy, honey? Yeah. When's he coming? He should be here any minute. Want a piece of apple? [ENGINE REVVING] Your daddy's here. Run, run, run, run. Give him a big hug. Wendy. Dad's here. Hey, sweetheart! Give me a hug, will you? [KISSES] Are you staying through the night? I gotta be back by midnight. You can stay. Where's Wendy? Huh? PHILIP: Do you know where she is? Tell me your new friend's name. Her name's Deborah. -Yeah? -Her mother is good baker. She makes great breads with her mother. Oh, did you eat 'em all up? Yes. [BOTH LAUGHING] How about you, Wendy? Got any new friends up here? WENDY: They're okay. Hey. Remember that game we used to play? You'd tell me anything, any problems you had I'd just say the magic words, and make everything all right? I was a kid, then. Besides, you haven't played that with me in years. Okay, then why don't you just tell me what's wrong? The kids up here don't want to be my friend. They don't want to be friends with... Friends with kids whose Dads... [SIGHS WEARILY] It's okay, Wendy. You can say it. Killed somebody. Okay? Okay, Dad? Hey, I didn't kill anyone. Then how come they arrested you? [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Go away. The whole thing's been hard on us all. The whole family. [TEARFULLY] You hurt mom. Why did you do that? Well... I can tell you this. I didn't mean to. [SIGHS] Look. The woman who died wanted to hurt me for some reason. I don't know why. PHILIP: But I want you to understand something. Nothing in the world is more important to me right now. And you believe me when I tell you I didn't do anything to that woman. Nothing. Baby. You've been drinking a lot. Yeah, well, what's a lot? ELLEN: You know what I mean. You don't usually have scotch for dessert. Usually what? Please don't use that tone of voice with me. And what tone is that? Cold, superior. Look, I'm just trying to help you. You're not helping a lot by staying up here. Well, what do you suggest I do? Leave the girls here by themselves? [SIGHS] You come in one day a week just to show solidarity. Solidarity? You asked me to believe you and I did. Don't you talk to me about solidarity when the damn newspapers know more about what's going on in my life than I do. Because the papers could handle it. Look what happened when you found out. Oh, of course, I forgot. It's my fault you lied. I never lied to you about Corrie. Oh, you left out a few juicy details. [YELLING] What the hell do you want me to do? You want me to hang myself? Jesus! Look. My point is, I need you and you're not there. The point is, you need me when it's convenient for you. The girls need me. Period. [CHUCKLES] You know what this is? This is Corrie's revenge. I saw all of this. You know sometimes I lay awake at night hating her so much I want to kill her and hating her even more because she's already dead. Hey. Will you stand up for me? God, I'm so sorry for you. I really, really am. [SIGHS WEARILY] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] MR. LAKE: Oh, Lake asked me to have you call him about what to wear to the trial. Philip. Yeah, remember. Look innocent. Just look straight at the person asking you the question. MR. LAKE: You'll be fine. ATTORNEY: A Psychiatrist. A wealthy respected member of the community meets a young woman, vulnerable, with no ties, no power. They have a brief affair. Passionate for her. Just a convenience, for him. When it's over, he lets her go. But she doesn't go away. This woman with nobody to mourn her in the world. She becomes a nuisance, hangs around. And so, this man. This man with everything to lose did what he felt he had to do so that Corrie Calvin wouldn't bother him anymore. MR. LAKE: There was no murder. So, Dr. Benesch cannot be a murderer. A very sick woman, angry with Dr. Benesch because he wouldn't respond to her advances committed suicide in a way that made it seem like Dr. Benesch killed her. MR. LAKE:She stole his gun. She planted a cup with his fingerprints on it in her apartment. She stole letters he had written to others to make it look like he'd written them to her. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, she engineered a plot at the expense of her life that if you fall into it, it will make you the jury guilty of the murder. Not Dr. Benesch. Detective Fracinetti, please. Philip. Doc? Hi, Fracinetti. How're you doing? What don't I know? You've got it all, doc. Nothing. Nada. Get me into Corrie's apartment. Doc, we went over that place with a fine tooth comb. There's nothing there. We got everything. I'll tell you what. Just... I'll call you. Don't call me, all right? ATTORNEY: The love letter whose handwriting was identified as Dr. Benesch's and the photograph came from Dr. Dann? Yes, they were in Dr. Dann's file on Corrie which we subpoenaed. Could you describe this photograph for the jury? Objection. They've already seen-- JUDGE: Overruled. Based on our analysis of shell markings, there is no doubt whatsoever that Benesch's gun was the murder weapon. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTOR REVVING] [CLICKS] [TEARING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [CLICKS] [DOOR CREAKS] [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] BC 14. Clerambault was the psychiatrist who did the initial research on Erotomania. So? What do you got there? One second. So, by using that name, it means she was diagnosed by a doctor as an erotomaniac before she came here. She used the name as a clue. She expected me to know it. No Rita Clerambault on file at RC&P. Well... I don't know. Try Corrie Calvin again. You never know when someone is asleep at the wheel. LESLIE: I'm running a program that will print out every possible permutation of the name Corrie Calvin. Just in case that's not her real name, and she changed it. [THUDS] I think we just struck oil. What? No police complaints in Vancouver See if there are any sealed complaints. I can't get in. Phil, you got a police clearance number? Sure. Is it still any good? LESLIE: Bingo. Okay, in 1988, a man named Robert Clarke filed two complaints with the Vancouver police Callie Colvin hanged his pet dog. God. Who was this guy? What do they have on Clarke? He's the psychiatrist. How did yo know? PHILIP: He's married with two children. How did you know? Forty five years old. White, an expert witness. [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLING] ATTORNEY: How long have you known the defendant, Dr. Dann? Eighteen years. I want to make it clear I'm here on subpoena. Not because I want to testify for you. MIKE: I also want to make it clear that I'm not Dr. Benesch's psychiatrist. Just his friend. During the twelve of those years Dr. Benesch was married, how many affairs did he confide in you? MR. LAKE: Objection. Your honor, Dr. Benesch's sexual history is relevant to our contention he seduced Corrie. Overruled. Three. [CLAMORING] MR. LAKE: Was the knowledge that Dr. Benesch was a chronic philanderer-- MR. LAKE: Objection! Your, honor. ATTORNEY: I'll rephrase. Did these affairs change your mind about whether Dr. Benesch had slept with Corrie? MIKE: They didn't change my mind. ATTORNEY: Then what do you call it, doctor? When Dr. Benesch referred Corrie to you, you accepted his diagnosis of her as an erotomaniac. Someone who makes up non-existent love affairs. ATTORNEY: After she showed you the photograph and the letter, you felt that she and Dr. Benesch had had sex. MIKE: No, I felt it was possible. ATTORNEY: You said, in grand jury testimony, I quote, "The letter and the photograph... Clarke didn't return my phone calls. I left messages for him in his home. You mean, a passionate love letter from Dr. Benesch to the deceased was only momentarily convincing? What do you need, Dr. Dann? To be there? MR. LAKE: What? You want to what? You can't leave the state let alone the country. Well, I am going. I speak his language. What, they don't speak English up there anymore? Come on. Look, I'll wait for you. Remember. We need her. [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS WEARILY] ELLEN: You lied to me. Yeah, I did You know what's really amazing? You've made me so angry I don't care whether they convict you or not. You might be innocent, and I don't give a damn. A terrible thing to feel about someone you love. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Could I offer you some coffee, Dr. Benesch? No, thanks. I had breakfast on my way up. Do you recognize this woman? Not off-hand. A great many students pass through BC. But not a great many that you complained to the police about. Can I see it again? You're referring to Callie Colvin. Is this important, doctor? I'm on trial for murdering her. I see. And did you? She killed herself. Made it look as though I killed her. Why would anyone do that? Because she thought I was you. Not literally, of course. CLARKE: Of course. I think she was obsessed with you for years. I know she wanted to hurt you. But you got beyond her so she did the next best thing. She found someone who resembled you as closely as possible. A forensic psychiatrist, married, who had affairs. A surrogate. She left clues-- My wife. She left clues because she wanted me to find you. And tell you how she constructed her revenge. I didn't kill her. I hardly knew her. She could kill me because of what she thinks you did to her. That sounds paranoid. Doesn't it, doctor? [SCOFFS] It would be, if you hadn't lodged those sealed complaints with the police. They're in our files. Did you sleep with her? No. But, testifying for you, it could destroy my marriage. I'm on trial for my life, doctor. My family's life. It was clever of Phil to find you, Dr. Clarke. To figure it out. I rather wish he hadn't. Even though you may save his life? An innocent man's life? CLARKE: So, you say. I wanted to kill Carrie many times. Dr. Benesch may not have had my self-control. Look, I don't want to hurt you, doctor. I also don't want to let my client die for nothing. Now, I'm gonna ask you some questions the prosecution is going to ask. Don't be offended. Did you sleep with Corrie? No. You're under oath, doctor. She claims you did. It's in her affidavit to the police. CLARKE: Nonetheless, I did not. MR. LAKE: So she lied. CLARKE: Yes. There was a department of psychiatry hearing into your problems with Corrie, wasn't there? Yes. In it, they asked you why you waited eleven months before you moved to have her dismissed as department secretary? During those eleven months, she called your house at odd hours, she camped out on your door step, she attacked your wife, left piles of feces in your car broke windows in your office and hanged your pet Schnauzer from a tree in your front yard. So, why did you wait eleven months? Because clearly-- MR. LAKE: You didn't meet Corrie as chairman of the department of Psychiatry You met her as your patient, didn't you? You couldn't complain about Corrie because what you knew about her was in confidence. But what she knew about you wasn't. You realized early on, you'd made a terrible mistake with Corrie that you had to wait eleven months to extricate yourself cause your only hope was to accumulate enough evidence that she was insane that any normal person would discount her claim that you had slept with her. But you had, hadn't you? Now, don't lie to me, doctor. My client could go to the electric chair, if you lie. I slept with her once. PHILIP: What the hell do you mean, "We can't use her?" She still harassed him, the complaint is still with the police. No way. You put him on the stand Rospel Hammon's gonna break him within minutes. Then she will argue that you and Clarke are peas in a pod. Powerful shrinks who seduced a sick, helpless girl, humiliate her when she begs for love and dump her when you're done. He fires her. You kill her. I'll have Les put him on the next bus home. Let's just pray they don't find out he exists. Wait for me. We'll get something to eat. Phil, we gotta call your wife. I already told you. No. Look, juries expect wives to testify for their husbands. They need that. No. They'll crucify her. I won't let 'em! You won't be able to stop 'em. Oh, you're afraid they're gonna make her cry? Is that it? Is that what you're worried about? No, damn it. I'm not afraid they're gonna make her cry. Then what? You know what I'm really afraid of? I'm afraid she thinks I did it. That's what I'm really afraid of. [SIGHS SOFTLY] Nonsense. [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] See if you can follow this, okay? You write a love letter to Sheila that ends up in Mike Dann's files as a letter to Corrie. Now, the handwriting is genuine. It means either you wrote the letter to Corrie, or Corrie stole it from someone you did write it to, that is Sheila. Yeah, yeah, we've already been over all this. If Sheila has all the letters you wrote her, Corrie must've copied the stolen letter and left the copy in Sheila's file. [ENCHANTING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] So if Sheila has a forged letter in her file, we're home free, man. [DOORBELL BUZZES] [DOORBELL BUZZES] It's Philip. It's important, Sheila. MR. LAKE: We need to see a letter that Phil wrote to you. We're fairly certain Corrie stole the original and we'd really like to take a look at what you've got. Oh, my God. What's wrong? I burned them. You burned them? What do you mean you burned them? After you came here, I thought they were compromising to both of us, so and I burned them. [SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Mrs. Benesch. When did you first learn your husband had affairs? About a year ago, I found a letter from one of his lovers. MR. LAKE: Sheila Prosser. Yes. Did you know about his other affairs before this trial? No. Did you know about Corrie Calvin? Not specifically. What do you mean, not specifically? ELLEN: A woman came to our house to our daughter's birthday party dressed as a rabbit. And later, I learned that it was Corrie Calvin. Later, meaning after Corrie died. Yes. Did you see her again? I believe she was parked in front of our house, sitting in a car. But I don't really remember if that was before or after the party but she was in the car just sitting. Just... sitting. Just sitting and staring. And the next thing you know, Corrie had died and the police were at your house. Yes. Mrs. Benesch, you've been married to your husband for twelve years. Did he ever hit you? No. Was he ever violent with the children? With animals? No. No. Pets? Does he have a temper? No, my husband is very logical. Does your husband lie, Mrs. Benesch? Yes. ELLEN: But, mostly by omission. Meaning? It's what he doesn't say that's the lie, not what he does. MR. LAKE: Did you ask your husband if he killed Corrie Calvin? Yes. What did he say? He said he didn't. MR. LAKE: Do you believe him? Yes. My husband isn't the type of man to kill. ELLEN: He doesn't need to do that to get what he wants. He's a psychiatrist. What if Corrie threatened to tell you they were having an affair, even though they weren't? What if Phil couldn't stop her? Would he kill her then? No. My husband didn't love me enough to kill for our marriage. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MR. LAKE: No further questions. Thank you, Mrs. Benesch. [COUGHS] ATTORNEY: Mrs. Benesch, how long was your husband sleeping with Dr. Prosser before you found out about it? About a year. And the one before that? I wouldn't know. And the one before that? Objection. Your honor, she's badgering the witness. JUDGE: Overruled. So you really know very little about your husband's emotional life in some ways. Wouldn't you say? Is your husband the type of man to write passionate love letters? I don't know exactly what you're trying to say. Is he, in your experience of him the type of man who would write, "When I think of you standing naked-- Objection, your honor. The witness has nothing to add to this letter. Overruled. ATTORNEY: Thank you, your honor. "Standing naked in the middle of my office Excuse me. I... PHILIP: Why are you doing this to her? Why are you deliberately humiliating her? [SLAMS GAVEL] JUDGE: Dr. Benesch One more outburst and I'll have you restrained. Your honor, the defense requests a five minute recess. Denied. Continue, counsel. It's obvious you don't know your husband very well at all. MR. LAKE: Objection, your honor! JUDGE: No gratuitous remarks, counsel. No further questions at this time. JUDGE: Fine. In that case, we'll recess for the rest of the day. [SLAMS GAVEL] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] You know, sometimes it just dies. And there's nothing you can do to get it back. [SNIFFLES] Why punish everybody by trying? Hey, look. I... You know, I was remembering this time when you picked me up after school. It was raining outside and I had this impulse to make you pull away to the side of the road to make love to me. But I didn't say anything about it, because I'd never done anything like that before. And part of me thought you wouldn't want to. You wouldn't want to. I'm sorry I didn't take that chance. Because now I realize a lot of other women were living out my fantasy. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [SIGHS WEARILY] [TV COMMENTATOR COMMENTATING] I don't know what to do, Phil. I mean, I can put you on the stand. I'm just afraid she's gonna tear you into pieces. Maybe we gotta think about cutting a deal here. Look. She must've slipped up somewhere. Who? Corrie. She had to have left something. The trap wouldn't have worked for her if she hadn't have left a clue. She needed people to understand how clever she was. Larry. Come on. Let's go back over there. Come back. What are you, nuts? Phil. Well, this is grim. [SIGHS WEARILY] [CLICKS] [SIGHS WEARILY] This is a waste of time, Phil. There's nothing here. [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] [STEALTHY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I'll take care of both of them. Get some rest. Don't get your hopes too high. I have to. I have to hope. Dr. Benesch, you've been forensic psychiatrist for many years. During that time, how do you feel about the legal system? I thought it was too lenient. You thought people who should've been convicted got off. I saw it happen. Many times. Have you changed your mind since your recent experiences with it? Somewhat. MR. LAKE: How? Oh, I realize everyone sees what they wanna see. The police find incriminating evidence, the DA finds a case, the defense finds loopholes, the defense psychiatrist finds diminished capacity and the State's psychiatrist finds no diminished capacity. And the truth? Now, that's harder to find. Dr. Benesch, when did you first meet Corrie Calvin? PHILIP: About six months ago. She was a court stenographer. She first approached me after a case where she took notes. What was your impression of her? PHILIP: She was very smart. Very attractive. Self-deprecating. When did your impression change? Well, she... She started turning up everywhere. On the ferry, my house. She kept calling and leaving messages on my answering service, writing me letters. You see, everywhere I looked, there she was smiling and flirting. [MAN COUGHS] Did you sleep with her? No. Did you kill her? No, I did not. MR. LAKE: Did you ever write her a love letter? PHILIP: No. Well... Well, how do you explain this letter in your handwriting which the state alleges you wrote to Corrie? I wrote that letter to Sheila Prosser. Corrie stole it and made a copy. And left the copy in Sheila's apartment. What happened to the copy? Sheila burned it along with the other letters that I wrote to her. Burned it. Dr. Benesch, have you ever broken the law? PHILIP: Twice. MR. LAKE: How? PHILIP: I crossed a police line to get into Corrie Calvin's apartment. I was looking for something, for anything, that might help to prove my innocence. Did you find it? PHILIP: Yes, I did. That blue book you're holding. Objection. This wasn't entered as evidence. It was in the apartment which is all states' evidence. The state had ample time to find it, and would have if it had done its job. Overruled. This is the blue book. PHILIP: Yes. What does it contain? Corrie Calvin's attempt to duplicate my handwriting. Objection. Opinion. Police graphologists confirmed it was Corrie's handwriting. Would you read us this sentence? PHILIP: "When I think of you standing naked in the office-- In other words, this is Corrie practicing copying the letter already entered into evidence. The letter that you wrote to Dr. Prosser. Objection. Opinion. Withdrawn. Withdrawn. Your witness. Dr. Benesch. How do we know you didn't plant this document in Corrie's apartment? You don't. How do we know even if you didn't that Corrie wasn't simply copying what you had written to her out of love trying to duplicate the emotions you felt when you'd written it? You don't yet. How do we know in fact that this whole thing isn't a ruse? Because if I'm telling the truth, if Corrie stole the letter from Sheila and made a copy, Sheila's fingerprints would be on the original. I beg your pardon. I asked-- I said, if Corrie stole the letter from Sheila, Sheila's fingerprints would be on the original. And according to the State's own fingerprint experts, counselor, Sheila's prints-- Your honor, I request a recess. Denied. PHILIP: You saw what you wanted to see, counselor. PHILIP: You thought that I had really written the letter to Corrie so you didn't look for anything else. But, in fact-- Your honor-- In fact, I didn't write anything to Corrie Calvin and I didn't murder her either. This does not belong in the record. JUDGE: [GAVEL BANGING] Order. And I never helped her. [SCOFFS] I wish I had. [ENGINE REVVING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'll be right back. Doc. Doc! [CHUCKLES] Hey, how're you doing? Good to see you. Hi. Congratulations. I hear they're not going to retrial. Well, thanks. We're all really grateful. Good. I bet. Hey, girls. Hi. Can you give me one minute with your dad, please? It's okay. Go ahead over there. We'll be over there in a minute. So you and your wife split up. I'm sorry to hear that. It's too bad. Well, I don't think too many marriages could survive that trial. It was a murderer on marriage, huh? Did you hear? Earl's gonna fly away. I saw it on the news. Well, there's germ out there. So what're you gonna do, doc? You gonna come back work for us, or what? Well, you know, I've been doing some community work and I really like that. I think my days of working for the police are over. No hard feelings though. We're only human. Even demons care, you know. Nah. No hard feelings. Well, maybe a few. I'm human, too. [CHUCKLES] Doc, there's something that always bothered me. I gotta ask you. I always thought that she framed you. But, what I could never ever figure out was why you? Because she was crazy. Doc, seriously. [SIGHS WEARILY] You know, at first I thought it was because she mistook me for someone else. But, now I think that what she really wanted was for someone in power, like me, for instance, to know something. What did she want you to know that she couldn't just tell you, doc? What if I liked to beat her? [CAPTIVATING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
