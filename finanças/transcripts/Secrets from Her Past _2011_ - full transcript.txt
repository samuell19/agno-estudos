- David, I hope you never, ever have to hear this, but if you are listening, something went very wrong. I'm missing, or worse. Where do I begin? It all started in Chicago, nearly 10 years ago. I was just finishing college, working as a bartender at a place called Mo's. My name wasn't Kate back then; it was Stephanie... Stephanie Wickers, my birth name. - Aren't you going out with Natalia tonight? - I am. She wants me to meet a guy at the art bar. - So you should go, then. - Mo, are you trying to get rid of me? - Oh, never, sweetie, but you go now. I'll finish up. - OK. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey, Mo. How's it going? You ready? - I am. Everyone wants me to go. Hold on. Have a good night. - Good luck on your date. - It's not a date. - It's a date. Now, Mo was a nice guy, but he was in debt and had borrowed from the wrong pockets. Oh, come on, Natalia. I think Mo can handle it. - No, no, I'm telling you, if he's doing business with Alex Ravik, he's playing with his life. - I don't now what I should do about it. I mean, it's not like he talks to me about that stuff. Oh, no. Shoot! - What? - I forgot my purse. Ugh! - Oh, don't worry. I'll pay. - It's fine. Oh, that's sweet, but I should go back. It has my ID and all my stuff. I'll just run back and get it. - I'll go with you. - It's fine. Honestly. You go ahead, tell Jean-Pierre I'll be right here. I'll meet you there. Go. Go. We've talked about this before. I was very clear, Mo. I want the money! - I can get you the money. Please, you don't have to do this. No! No! Hey! - The man that killed Mo that night was Alex Ravik. He was a member of one of the fastest growing crime syndicates. No! - I saw him, and I could identify him, and because I left my purse there that night, he could identify me. I, I just saw someone get shot. His name is Mo Stefanokis, and he needs an ambulance immediately. - What's the address? - He's at Mo's Bistro on 123rd Street. - I'm sending help. Did you see who shot him? Is this your cell phone? - Um... - Are you the Stephanie Wickers registered with this phone? - I... - There was no doubt in my mind that Ravik would find me before the cops caught him. So I made the only choice I could. I decided to disappear. I didn't tell anyone where I was going, not even my mom. Everyone thought that Alex Ravik found me, or I'd killed myself. For the last 10 years, I've been safe in this new life. But it's all caught up with me. Ravik has now hired a hitman to find me and kill me. - Oh, no problem. Kate should be in any minute, so I'll let her know when she gets here. Bye. - Hey. - Hey. So? I'm dying to know about last night. - Oh, it was amazing. It was so nice to spend more than 3 hours alone with David. - I knew you'd have a good time. Oh, uh, before I forget, Sahim called...the contractor. He wants to meet on Thursday. - Thursday works. That's great. I'm glad we're finally getting this done. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Shawn. What's up? - Hey, I was wondering, maybe one of you two want to play a game of... one on one? - I have a client coming in. - Kate? - Sorry, can't. I'm busy. - You know, you keep rejecting me like this, I'm gonna develop a complex. - Really? Your ego seems pretty well intact to me. - We would make such cute babies. Or at least have fun trying. - Yeah. David says he sleeps with all the nurses at the hospital. - So are you saying I should become a nurse? Ugh. No. - And this is the knight, and it can only make an L-move, right? And this is the queen, and she can go wherever we wants. Speaking of queens, there's your mother. - Hey, honey. - Hi. - How was your day? - Pretty good. How was yours? - It was great, except for the slew of jokes about being the oldest graduating resident in the history of the world. - You're kidding me. I thought the hazing would stop once you became a doctor. - Yeah, you and me both. Not gonna happen. - Is everything really fine? Why are you home so early? - What are you talking about? I just thought it'd be nice if the two of you didn't spend dinner alone for once. - Dad said we can have mac' and cheese. - Hey, hey, hey. That's a surprise. I can make it. - Yeah, you better. - I can. - I'm gonna go make some grilled chicken to go on top. - Deal. - Deal! - And this is the king. It can only make one move, right? Are these tickets to Oliver's play? - Yeah. We're supposed to sell as many as we can. I thought you could take them to the hospital, see if anybody would want to come. - It's on the 3rd. That's the same night as the medical association meeting. - David, I told you about this 2 months ago. - I know, I know. I forgot. I'm sorry. And I promised Wes I'd be there. - You're kidding me. You said you weren't gonna do this kind of stuff anymore. You realized what was important to you. - And I do realize it. I really do. I can't just suddenly not show up for work and be here 24/7. - No one's asking you to do that, and you know it. - I can't make it to everything all the time. Especially if we want to get out of debt. - Wow. Fine. Whatever. I think you should tell Oliver yourself. - Evidence. This is officer Chin. - Hi, yes, I know it's late. This is Detective Meisen. I... - Meisen? Have we worked together? - No. - Do I know you? - No, you don't know me. I just transferred here. - What do you need, Detective? - Well, the reason I'm calling is because I'm taking over the Alex Ravik file. - Mm-hmm. - And I need to request some evidence on a cold case. - Misha... Remember about 10 years ago our, uh, friend, Mo Stefanokis passed away? Remember the witness? A young girl by the name of Stephanie Wickers. - I recall you mentioning it. Why? - I want you to do what you did to that young man who went missing in Mexico City. - That guys was a bitch to find. - And yet you found him. - We don't even know if this Stephanie chick's alive. I mean, didn't Quill find the car in the river? - Yes. And he told me that it looked like she fabricated the whole thing. - So why are we looking for this bitch now? I mean, if she's willing to fake her own death, she ain't coming back. - No, it wouldn't have been a problem if our good friend Detective Quill hadn't left the force. This new guy, this, uh, this Meisen... He's trying to bury me. - That's not too smart. Maybe he's the one I need to take care of. - Oh, that would be sweet. But you know better, my friend. Find this girl. I'm certain she's out there somewhere. Our standard contract will apply. - I told you our standard contract doesn't apply anymore. I want an extra 50. - You want an extra 50 G's? An extra 50 G's? Misha, you're in no position to negotiate. You need the money, and everyone knows it. Find that girl. - So... Are you still mad at me about the play? - I'm just tired. A lot of junk going on at the gym. The city didn't approve the plans for the new wing, and a lady slipped at the pool. Just stuff. - So, basically, you're still ticked. - Well, David, it just seems like the more that I support you, the more that Oli and I get taken advantage of. - I know it's been tough, but I can't think of anyone who's been more supportive of me quitting my teaching career and going back to medical school than you have. And I love you for it. I don't want you to ever think that I'm taking advantage of you. - Well, David, the only person that can change anything is you. - And I wish I could, but we're close; we're real close. Look, I know you thought things would get a lot better once I finished my residency, and it hasn't. OK, I got it. But I need to show that I'm 100% dedicated and I can compete with these guys who are 15 years younger than I am. - I know. - Hey. I know I'm not giving you the time that I need to. You are the more important thing in the world to me. You really are. - You know what I think? - Mmm... No. What do you think? - I think you're gonna be one of the best doctors that Harbor General has ever had, and they're gonna name a wing after you. - Yeah? With gold letters and everything? - Oh, absolutely. The David Collins Wing for Children That Can't Recognize Their Own Fathers. - You are such a smartass. You know that? You know that? But I love you. - I love you too. Oliver, I was looking at this, and I think you have a really good chance of winning the science fair with this project. - I hope I win. Mom, do you remember when man first landed on the moon? - I was... not old enough to remember that, but your grandmother...my mom... she was alive. She watched it on TV. It was history in the making. - I wish I had a grandma. It's not fair! They both died before I was born! About time, Miss Wickers. - I'm glad that David's happier being a doctor than he was a teacher, but I miss the days when he was home for dinner, home on the weekends. - Hey, you guys. - Hey. - Hey. - So are you going there tonight? - I am. - Hmm. Yep. Well, we'll see you there. I'm glad you're going. - Enjoy your workout. - Bye. - What was that all about? - Stop. That reminds me, can you please babysit Oli tonight? I have to go to this charity event for the hospital with David. - I can't. I have to interview that kickboxing trainer. Remember? - Oh, gosh, that's right. Yes. - Of course, if Dr. Hottie is going to this little shindig, I say we just 86 the kickboxing altogether. It's, you know, totally overrated. - Yeah, you would think that, wouldn't you? Stop! Please. - Philadelphia. What have we here? Nice. There we go. - Amanda. So how are you? - Hi, Kate. You look beautiful. - Hello again. - Oh, my God. Hello, handsome. - Thank you. - How are you? - David. - Shawn. Excuse us. - Sure. - Hi, Dave. - How are you? - I'm good. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Great. Thanks. How are you? - You look stunning. - Oh, you're just not used to seeing me in anything other than my gym uniform. - No, you look beautiful in those too. - Yes, she does. Is Jenny here? - Jenny? - The girl you brought to the country club the other night. - Oh, Janet. She's fine. She's just a friend. Kate, I heard you're opening a new branch on the east side. Is that true? - Yes. Yeah, we are. We're excited. I think it's gonna be a great location. David, your wife is gonna be more successful than you. - Sorry to interrupt. There's someone I want you to meet. - Oh, sure. Take care. - Do we need a drink? Huh? - Please. - Collins. - Hey, Wes. - Wow, you look terrific. - Oh, thank you, Wes. How are you? - I'm a lucky man, am I not? - Yeah. Uh, could I get a bottle of water, please? - Sure. - Not drinking tonight? - Ah, no, I gotta be back at the hospital in a couple of hours. I've been gone pretty much all week since Myra's on bed rest. - Oh, that's right. Oh, I forgot. How is she feeling? - Well, as good as she can, I guess, with 2 babies trying to kick their way out. - Speaking of twins, did you hear about the 2 twins that came into the ER the other night? - No. What happened? - Twelve-year-old boys, torn ACL from playing football. - Both of them. - The same day? - Same day. - Rough sport. - Records. - Hey, Sandra. Can you get me a current number for a Marilyn Wickers? - OK. - Last known address was in Lakeside Park. - Kids Battling Cancer has now provided treatment for more than 11,000 children in 6 countries. We couldn't do it without you. I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight, and for your undying support of a very worthy cause. And now, for the moment you've all been waiting for, the Kids Battling Cancer Benefactor of the Year award goes to... ...Dr. Shawn Tessle. - Just when you thought his ego couldn't get any bigger. - Thank you, Amanda, and thank you, everyone, for coming here tonight. It's a privilege, an honour, to receive this award. One of my passions has always been to help people who need it. - So, what'd you think of Shawn's acceptance speech? - He obviously thinks highly of himself, but he did give $25,000 to the organization. And didn't you tell me he did, what, 10 or 15 pro Bono surgeries last year? - I'm surprised he finds the time between shopping for Porsches and trolling for women half his age. Is he like that at the gym too? - He can be a little flirtatious, but deep down I think he's a decent guy. - He's definitely a skilled surgeon, and I wouldn't mind having his reputation someday. As a doctor, not a womanizer. - Becky, thank you so much for coming. Please drive safely. - Good night. - So what exactly did she say happened at dinner? - Oh, it was silly, really. He told her that he was allergic to onions, and that's why he couldn't eat my chicken cacciatore that I left for him. She didn't know what to do, so she just ordered a pizza. I swear, that kid will do anything to get out of eating something healthy. - It's not just that. He lied. He's not allergic. I've talked to him about this before. He knows how important it is to tell the truth. - Oh, of course he does, honey. It's just something kids do, you know? They go through this phase where they fib a little bit. - Honey, I understand that, but he needs to know it's not OK to be dishonest. I'll talk to him about it tomorrow. - Don't be too hard on him. I mean, he's not a liar. - Kate, he needs to learn now, or else he ends up lying to you and me, and then we get a kid we can't even trust. Right? - So you in Phili for business or pleasure? - Both. - So, when did you say your wife and daughter will be moving out? - Uh, 2 months. - Ah. Well, the gym's right this way. We have a very good Phys. Ed. department here. You said your daughter plays basketball? - Yeah, she's very good. - Ah. Girls, off to class, please. - Looks like you guys do well in science too. - Oh, yes, we do. In fact, we're hosting the all-school science fair this afternoon. Now, can I show you our auditorium? It's right this way. - Sure. - They're inducing labour, which means I have to be there. - I understand, but why send me? Wouldn't you rather send someone with more experience? - David, you were right there while I was doing the research. It makes total sense that you'd do the presentation. Look, it's just 4 days. You rub elbows with some famous doctors. Free food and booze, huh? It's not like I'm asking you to clear minefields here. - I know, I know. And I understand it's a great opportunity. - Good, good. You go, and I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna watch my kids enter the world, all right? Get the travel info from Janet. She'll take care of everything. - I understand, Wes. But my wife won't. Mars. - Don't worry, kiddo. I think yours is by far and away the best. - Wow. Nice solar system. - The planets move. - That's terrific. What grade are you in? - Third grade. - Your son's very smart. - Thank you. Oli, what do you say? - Thanks. I'm gonna move Saturn a little. - Do you have a child that entered the fair? - Yeah, 7th grade. My daughter, she did a project on mould. - Hm! - We had Petri dishes in the fridge for like a month. - Aww, I can relate to that. Well, tell her that we wish her a lot of luck. - Thank you. I will. - It's OK, sweetheart. Your dad is gonna be really proud of you. I promise. You did really well. There's no reason to be upset. - Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late. I had an emergency appendectomy, and then Wes needed to talk to me. So, how'd it go, champ? - I'm not a champ. I got 3rd. - I thought you had it in the bag. What happened? - Hey, 3rd place out of 16 kids your age is still really good! - Hey, that's still top 20%. I really wish he wouldn't get down on himself like that. - Well, you weren't here for the judging, and everything just kind of went south after that. - My fault again, huh? - Go talk to him, please. - Sorry. - It's OK. - Third place is pretty good. - Oliver. - Right here, Dad. Just getting a drink. - You OK, buddy? - Yeah. - Let's go back in and help your mom. What do you say? - OK. - Uh, you must be Oliver's dad. I'm Ivan. - David. - Nice meeting you. He was telling me about his 3rd place. I thought you had the best project. I think you should have won. - Yeah, we got robbed, didn't we? - Yeah. - Come on, let's go. - Oh, by the way, um, what's your wife's name? I met her inside, but I forgot. I'm bad with names. - Kate. - That's right. Kate. Well, it was nice meeting you. - Bye. - Bye. - My daughter is dead. If she were alive, I'd know it. - Well, I saw that you contacted Detective Quill once a month for about 3 years after Stephanie's disappearance. And then you just stopped. Why is that? - It took me that long to accept the truth... that she was never coming home. - It wasn't because she contacted you, and you found out she was alive? - Like I said, the last day I saw my daughter was before her boss's murder. I never heard from her again. - Mrs. Wickers, I'm going to be very frank with you. I'm reopening every case Alex Ravik may have been a part of, and he knows that's what I'm doing. If your daughter's alive, you need to tell me so I can find her before he does. - Well, if I could help you, I would. - OK. In case you remember anything. Mrs. Wickers, there's no place she could be that Ravik won't find her. - I tried. Trust me. What was I going to tell Wes? "Sorry, but you've got to miss the birth of your twins"? - I don't know why you're getting defensive. I'm not upset that you're going. - You do seem a little upset. Come on. - No, I'm fine. I'm getting used to it by now. - OK, look, I promise I'll make it up to you and Oli when I get back. We'll go to the movies, we'll go skating, we'll make a whole day of it. - Have a safe flight, baby. - OK, thanks. I'll call you when I get there. - Please don't forget. - OK. - Jab, cross, uppercut! Who are we beating up today? - Jonathan. - Jonathan. That was, what, 2 exes ago? - He tried to booty call me last night on text. - I'm stressed out today. David left for New York this morning. He's gonna be gone 4 days this time, and I found out they're reassessing the house. I wasn't really expecting to pay that bill, and with everything I have to do to open the new gym, it's just... I feel like I'm losing my mind. - Well, when you put it that way, your life does kind of suck. I'm kidding! Listen, everything is gonna get better, and you know what? It's all gonna happen at once. In 6 month's time, David'll be making more money, the doors to the new gym will be open, and I will be running it just like you would. And, who knows, maybe Oliver will drop out of private school so you don't have to pay tuition. - Very funny. - Doctor. - I know it's tough with him being away, but you've gotta remember, other people have it worse. David's only away for a few days, and it's not a battle zone. - I know. You're right. You're right. You're always right. - I know. That's why men are intimidated by me, don't you think? - Well, that, and your uppercut's getting pretty good. - Yeah, well, my roundhouse ain't bad either. - Oh! Ow! OK. - "Pro Fitness Function." Kate. Don't scream. I'm not gonna hurt you. I know who you really are, Stephanie, and I know all about what happened in Chicago. - I think you have the wrong woman. - No, I don't. And you don't have time to play games. - Who are you? - A person hired to kill you. The murder case has been reopened. And Ravik is afraid that the cops will find you, and you'll testify. - Do the cops know that I'm alive? - I have no idea. All I know is that Ravik's not taking any chances, and he's hired me to make sure that you end up at the bottom of the Delaware. You make a move, and I'll do it right here. - Kate. - Answer her. - Hey, Hanna. - You OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I just ran into a... ...friend from high school. - Nice meeting ya. - I'll, uh, see you later, hon. - OK. - Why are you doing this? - Because I have 2 choices: I can kill you, make 50 grand, or we can make a deal. You're opening a new gym, your husband's a doctor. I want to do the exact same thing you did, and disappear. Poof. - We don't have the kind of money that you think we do. And that's exactly what I would say if I were you. How much do you think your life is worth, Stephanie? - How much do you want? - Two hundred thousand, and you'll never see me again. - I can't come up with that kind of cash. - You're a smart girl. You'll figure it out. - Even if I did, Ravik will still have me killed. - If it wasn't for these, I would never have found you. - Is my mother OK? - She doesn't even know that they're missing. Now, you call her up, and you tell her to get rid of the other ones. It's the only link I could find, and I've been doing this a long time. If you don't come up with the cash, I will kill you. And then I'll go back to Chicago and I'll kill your mother, just for the fun of it. - Now, you got 4 days. Get the cash. - Doctor Collins. - Dad, it's me. - Hey, buddy. How's it going? - I'm at school, and I don't know where Mom is. Rehearsal ended 10 minutes ago. - Oh, yeah? Is someone there with you? Hi, honey. - Kate? Where are you? - Um, I'm... I'm on my way to pick up Oliver. - Yeah, he just called me. His teacher said he tried your cell, but you didn't answer. - Oh, I, um, I must have gotten tied up with something at work. I'm sorry. I guess the ringer was off. - You OK? You sound stressed. - I'm fine. Everything's fine. - My own mom forgets about me! - Oh, sweetheart. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I just had an emergency at work. - What kind of emergency? Did someone die? - No! No, nothing like that. It was nothing, really. Just some... ...guy I knew in high school. His name is Carl. - Is he single? You know how I like tall guys. - Um, he's married, actually. It's, uh... I think he met his wife... ...in Mexico. - Hello? - Hey, buddy. What are you doing? - Eating dinner. - Yeah? Anything good? - Not really. Mom made the worst pasta I've ever had. Sorry about that. Let me talk to her, all right? - OK. I gotta go find her. She's talking on her cell phone somewhere. - By the way, do you know how much we have in the account? Didn't you make a bank deposit today? - Uh, yeah. - Dad wants to talk to you. - Oh, OK. Hanna, can you hang on one second? - OK. - Thanks, sweetheart. Will you go finish your dinner, please? - It's gross! - Oliver, just go, please! - Fine. - Hi, sweetheart. Uh, can I call you back in just a minute? - Yeah. What's going on? - I'm just, uh, on the other line with Hanna. We're going over some financial stuff regarding the gym. - Call me back. I'll be in my room. - OK, honey. Talk to you in a minute. Bye. Hanna? Sorry. It was David. I'll call him back. Anyway, do you remember off the top of your head about how much is in the account? - Uh, around 25,000. Why? - I'm just curious. All right, honey. Well, have a good night. I'll see you tomorrow. - OK. Nighty-night. - Only 25,000. Damn it. Hey, honey. - Figured after I got married, I'd never have to wait by the phone again. - I'm sorry. I haven't called you back. It's just things got really hectic. - Hectic? - Yeah. Oliver isn't feeling well, and didn't want to finish his dinner, and just... some other stuff. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll take a look at him when I get back. Maybe he picked up a bug at school or something. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, how, how's the conference? - Good, good. I was, uh, actually thinking about skipping out a day early, though. Coming back the day after tomorrow. - Oh. Well, um, I mean, you know, we're OK. We miss you, but, you know, don't come back just for us. They must need you there if they sent you. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - Listen, sweetheart, I'm just so exhausted, I'm gonna head to bed. I'll talk to you tomorrow? - Sure. You sleep tight. - You too. - Kate... I love you. - I love you too. - With the new gym you're building, you've already maxed out your credit line, Kate. There's just no room to budge. - Well, what would I need to do go get a $200,000 loan? - You could get a 3rd mortgage on your house, but we both know that'd take your husband to co-sign. - I don't want to involve David at all. You're telling me there's nothing I can do on my own? - My advice would be to see if your personal credit cards can extend your credit line, and give you at cash advance. That'd probably be your best option. - Hi, yes. My name is Kate Collins. I just need to speak to someone about increasing my line of credit. - Credit card department. - Hi. This is Kate Collins. I need to talk to someone about increasing my credit. - May I help you? - Hi. Yes, I need to extend my line of credit. Is there someone that I can talk to, please? - One moment, please. - Hey. Um, there's a guy out there who wants to talk to you about suspending his membership for a couple of months. - I'm sorry, can you hang on one second? Just tell him I'll be with him in 5 minutes. Please? It is... ...5113 4047... ...5039 1432. And there's also this ring. - Eight grand. That's the best I can do. - Eight thousand dollars for all of this? But that... This was, this is an antique. My grandmother got it in Paris. - Look, I've got to make a profit. I can't move this stuff. But THAT I could get some cash for. - My wedding ring? - Yep. You wouldn't believe how many guys come in here looking for those things. - I don't know if I can sell my wedding ring. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me one second. Hey, Hanna, what's up? - Where are you? Did you forget we have an appointment with the contractor? - I'm so sorry. I, uh, this time I can't make it. - Seriously, Kate, where are you? - I'm just at, uh, at Oli's school, taking care of some things. I'll have to call him first thing in the morning. OK? I'll see you soon. Thanks. Kate, wait... - OK, I'm so sorry about that. Um... - Somebody must love you a whole lot. Three grand. - Thank you very much. You know what? I just can't do this. But definitely appreciate your time. Is that a digital voice recorder? - Yep. Works great. - I'll take it. David, I hope you never, ever have to hear this, but if you are listening, something went... very wrong. I'm missing, or worse. The man who killed Mo was Alex Ravik. - Hi, you've reached Kate Collins. Please leave a message. - Hey, honey. It's me. I'm in between functions, so I thought I'd give you a call. Call me back when you can. Love you. - Pro Fitness Function. This is Hanna. - Hey, Hanna. It's David Collins. How are you? - Oh, hi, David. Good, I'm good. - Is Kate there? I couldn't reach her on her cell. - She is not here, actually. I think she had to go to Oli's school or something. - Really? When will she be back? - I'm not exactly sure. Do you want me to leave her a message? - Yeah, if you could, please. Ask her to call me when you see her. - I will. - Thanks. - OK, bye. - Reservations. - Hi, this is David Collins. I'm in New York and scheduled to fly back to Philadelphia in 2 days. - Yes, sir. How may I help you? - Yeah, I'd like to change that if possible, and fly back today. - Certainly. - Ravik has now hired a hitman to find me and kill me. But for $200,000 I can buy him off. I was just so terrified... ...I decided to pay him the blackmail. But I don't know if he'll keep his word. If he doesn't, I just wanted you to know what happened. - Oh, hey. David called here looking for you. - Oh. What did you tell him? - I told him you were at Oli's school. That is where you were, right? - Fine, yeah. Whatever. - Kate! Please. What is going on with you? OK, this has got to stop. Whatever it is, you can tell me. - I can't. - This all started after you saw that guy yesterday. Who is he? Oh, Kate. You are not alone, OK? I'm here. - Oh, Hanna. - What? - Ten years ago... ...I witnessed a murder. And I was so terrified that I changed my name and moved here, but they found me. If I don't give them $200,000, they're gonna kill me. - What? - I need you to hold on to that recorder right there. - If I go missing, I need you to give it to David. It explains what happened. - Oh... Oh, my God. - I've already put together $100,000, and I have 8 more there. It's every piece of jewellery that means anything to me. But 108, that's not enough. - No, listen to me. You cannot pay this guy off. You need to tell David everything that's happened, and then you need to go to the police! - No, I can't. They'll kill me. They'll kill me, and Oli, and David, and my mother back at home. This guy, Alex, that put a hit on me, he's one of the biggest guys in the crime ring right now. - OK, so can't they put you in witness protection or something? - They would kill you just because you're my friend. Am I supposed to put the whole world in the witness protection program? Then why wouldn't I have just done that the first time around? Do you know how hard it is to just relocate? David would have to find a new career, Oli would have to go to a new school, I'd have to get a new job. - I don't know. I mean, there just has to be something. - There is. I have to pay these guys off. I don't have a choice, and time is running out, so the only thing that's on my mind right now is how to get this $100,000. - But you really think you can pay this guy off without David finding out? - I don't know. The whole point of me going along with this stupid blackmail is so I can get my normal life again. I can't lose David. - Oh, honey. You think that he would leave you? - I don't know what he will do. I don't... I don't know. - Oh! - Everything that his wife has told him for the past 8 years has been based on a lie. - I know, but I just... I just think that he would understand. - It's a lot to understand. What if he doesn't? What if he wants to leave? Trust me, I have thought through this. I have to pay them off. Hanna, please, please, just... just help me. Help me figure out a way to get the money. Thank you for seeing me. - You said on the phone you had something to show me. - I'm not sure I should actually be here. I could be making a horrible mistake. - Stephanie's alive, isn't she? - You were right about the reason that I stopped pestering Detective Quill about finding Stephanie. Three years ago, after she went missing, I received a phone call from her. She had just given birth to her son, Oliver. And she wanted to tell me about it. She wouldn't tell me where she was living, but for 7 years, she has sent photos now and again, and I know she's living in Philadelphia. Now, there were 6 photographs originally. - I don't understand. - Three of them are missing. You're right. Somebody is looking for her. Somebody must have come into my house and taken them. - Wait... I think I know who can loan you the money. - Who? - Dr. Hottie. - Shawn? No, no. He works with David, and David really doesn't like him. - David isn't going to find out, though, right? - Oh, Shawn. - Hey. How are you? What's up? I haven't seen you all day. Where you been? - Just, uh, holed up in my office, busy. - What's going on? - If you have a minute, I would love to talk to you. - Sure. You want to go talk in your office? - Please. - I'll go take a shower, and I'll be right over. - OK, thanks. - Hey, is everything OK? OK... You're... you're asking me to... ...to loan you a hundred grand. But you won't tell me what it's for. - Because I can't. If David were to find out, my marriage would be over. I'm just desperate. I'm just really, really desperate. - I gotta... I gotta think about this. - Of... of course, yeah. - Listen, how long... how long do you need for an answer? - Um, tomorrow. I have 2 days to come up with the cash. - Yeah. - I haven't heard from you. How's it going? - I'm still trying to locate her. - You keep me informed. - Yeah, I will. When I find her, you'll know about it. - Rough day? - David, oh, my goodness. What are you doing here? Why are you home so soon? - I decided I needed to be here more than there. - Oh. - What's going on? What's up with this? - Oh, I... ...brought my jewellery to work with me this morning, 'cause... Hanna wanted to borrow a few pieces for this weekend. - I don't know what to say to you right now. I feel like there's something weird going on with you, and yet you obviously don't want to tell me what it is. - There's nothing. Really, there's nothing. - Kate, I know you. Do you want to talk? I know I've been gone a lot lately, and... if you're... ...lonely, and... - David. Are you asking me if I'm having an affair? God, no! No, absolutely not. I'm sorry. I've just been... ...stressed about money, I guess, and the new gym. And I love you so much. Sweetheart, please, please don't ever doubt that. OK. OK. Well, look, since I am home early, why don't I go pick up Oli, and we can, uh... ...go take him to his favourite restaurant. How's that? - Yeah, that sounds great. - I'll go pick him up. Hey, there, buddy. Slow down. Your digestive system isn't gonna be able to keep up with you mom. - Hey, have you heard from Wes? Did his wife have the babies yet? - Yeah, he actually texted me in New York. Anika and Alarie. What are their names? - Anika and Alarie. - Um, I need to take this. I'll be right back, guys. Hello? - Get the children. It's your favourite bodyguard. - Why are you calling me? - Just checking in. I can't follow you everywhere. And I don't want you to forget about me while you're enjoying some alone time with the family. - Of course you will. I'll call you in 48 hours, and then I'll tell you where to meet me. And then you'll have 30 minutes to get there so you don't stray too far away from home. - Fine. - Sweet dreams, Stephanie. You're asking me to loan you a hundred grand, and you won't tell me what it's for? If David found out, my marriage would be over. I gotta think about this. And I will call you in the morning, all right? If you don't come up with the cash, I will kill you. - I've thought a lot about what you asked me, and, um, I want you to know that I have the cheque for you. Kate, I was wondering if you could come to my house this evening to pick it up when I'm finished with my shift. - Yeah, I mean, of course. - OK, good. I should be back at about 7 o'clock or so. - OK. Um, Shawn, thank you so much. - I'll see you then. Excuse me. Hey, Kate. - Hey, babe. How are you? Um, all right, listen. Uh, one of, one of my instructors called in sick today, and I'm gonna have to stay late and teach her class. Can you pick up Oli? 'Cause I don't think I'll be home till around 8. - Yeah, I can do that. - OK, sweetheart. Thank you. I'll talk to you later. - See you later. - Hi. - Hey. - Come on in. I thought maybe we could have a chat. I'm sure it's been awhile since someone made you dinner. Look, I've been thinking about the loan, and I came up with a pretty good idea I would like to talk to you about. Come in. Have a seat. Look, I don't know why you need this money, and I'm not gonna ask you again. I promise. I just want you to know that... ...I'm flattered that you came to me for help. - David can't know that I'm here. Shawn, I know you see him almost every day at the hospital. He cannot... - Yeah, I understand. David is not gonna know. - You had an idea. - Oh, yeah. Yes. I was thinking that... ...instead of a loan... ...it could be... ...an investment in your new gym. That way you don't have to worry about paying me back. Quite frankly, I think we make a pretty good team. Cheers. - I don't quite know what to say. I'm really happy in my marriage. - Are you? Really? Then why didn't you go to your husband for help? Look, I'm not asking you to get a divorce. I'm just saying that we... that we both have needs, and we can provide those needs for each other. Right? - I need to get out of the situation that I'm in. - You need more than that, OK? - Shawn. - You work full time; David is never around; you're the only one taking care of your child. Don't you enjoy this? You know, a glass of wine, someone to cook you dinner once in a while? Me? I know I've dug a really deep hole for myself because I need this money. If sleeping with you is a condition in order for me to get that, then... Well, I don't have a choice. But I'm not gonna enjoy cheating on my husband. - I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do. But I want you to know that you're an amazing woman. Incredible. OK? Take it. - Thank you. - Kate? - Hey, honey. - How was class? - Uh, it was fine. I'm just tired. I'm not feeling great, so I'm gonna go on up to bed. - Are you sick? You got a fever? - No, no, nothing like that. It's just my... back. Long day, you know. I'll see you upstairs. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Oli, let's get going here. OK, Dad. - I left my wallet upstairs, buddy. I'll be right back. - Come on, Dad. I'll be late for school. - Hey, honey. I'm glad you're home. Uh, I'm gonna have to go back to the gym in a minute. - Go back? What for? - Just some... paperwork I forgot to do for that meeting tomorrow morning with the architect. - Where's Oliver? - He's upstairs. Why? - I've been trying to figure out all day how to say this. So I'm just gonna come right out and ask you, and I want you to tell me the truth. Can you tell me the truth, Kate? - Yes, of course. - I know Shawn Tessle called you this morning. I came in while you were in the bathroom. How long have you been seeing him? - I'm not seeing him, David. - Then why does he have your cell phone number, Kate? - Honey, just... - Kate. - I have to take this. I, I, I have to. Hello? - It's time. Do you have the money? - Yes. - Good. I'll meet you at your son's school in 30 minutes. - I wanted to go someplace more public. - I think it's perfect. East door #6 will be unlocked, and I'll meet you in your son's classroom in 30 minutes. - Fine. Fine. Baby, I'm gonna have to go right now. - Go where? Who was that? - I want to explain this to you. I just can't right now. - This is unbelievable. Are you going to meet him? - No, David, I'm not! I'm not! Just please listen to me for a second. - Then where are you running off to, Kate?! - I can't talk to you about this right now! I'm so sorry! I'll explain it later. Just trust me. But I have to go. - Come on up. - Hello, Misha. Ugh! Ugh! - Misha, Misha, Misha. Bishop. - David, answer the phone, please. - Hello? - David... Listen to me. Something has happened. - What's going on? - I can't explain this right now. I'll explain it later, but I need you to pack some things in a bag, and take Oli, get in the car, and go to your brother's cabin. And I need you to do this right now. - Why, Kate?! Tell me! What the hell's going on? - Someone is after me. - Someone's after you? - And I'm afraid that they could come after you too. - Where are you? - I just need you to trust me on this and get to the cabin as soon as you can. If I'm not there when you get there, just wait for me, please. - If you're in trouble, I'm calling the police, Kate. - David, please. That would be the worst thing you can do right now. Trust me on this. Do not call the police. Promise me. David. Please. I really need you right now. Please. Just trust me. Please don't call the police, and just get to the cabin. - All right. All right. We'll meet you there. But I want you to tell me what the hell's going on! - I will. - Hey, buddy. Come on. Get up. Get up. Wake up. Come on. I want you to pack some clothes in your backpack, OK? - Where are we going? - Up to your Uncle Jim's cabin. Come on. Let's go. - Excuse me. May I please use your rest room? My, uh, my contact fell out, and I'm afraid I might lose it. - Oh, I'm sorry. We're closing up. - Ah, please, I can't drive without it. I promise I'll just be a moment. - Um... Yeah, OK, sure. The lockers are in the back. - Thank you. They're in the back? Thank you. - Attention, please. The gym and the locker rooms are now closing. Please exit the premises promptly. Thank you. Everyone out? - Mm-hmm. - OK, champ. Wake up. We're here. Are you OK? - Yeah. - Is anyone following you? - No, I don't think so. Where's Oliver? - He's upstairs, asleep. Please, Kate, tell me what's going on. - I will. I will. I promise. Let's just sit down and I'll tell you everything. - Kate Collins. Seventy Whitehall Drive. - I was just so terrified, I didn't know what to do. I was young, and I ran. I came here to start over, and I didn't know if I would ever feel normal or safe again. - Why? Why didn't you tell me any of this, Kate? - I didn't know how. I didn't know where I would begin. I... When we met, I'd already been Kate for over a year. I... ...had just put all of that behind me. - I can't believe that you never trusted me enough to tell me the truth. - It wasn't about trust. And the closer we got, the more you wanted to know about me and my past...my education, my family... the bigger the story became. David, please say something. - I don't know what to say, Kate. You tell me the mob's after you, that you're not the person who I think you are, and instead of telling me any of this and trusting me, you confide in and borrow money from the one guy whose principles and ethics are the complete opposite of mine. - I know. God, I've made a lot of mistakes. I borrowed money from Shawn because I... I was afraid for you to know this about me. I was just scared. I thought you would leave me. I didn't want to lose our marriage. - Misha, Misha, Misha. Brazil. How predictable! - I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. - All I can think about right now is that we're holed up in this cabin, and there's some guy out there who's trying to kill you. Kill my family! - Maybe you should just take Oli and go. - And go where? No, Kate. No. I'm not leaving you alone. We need to call the police. They should have been involved from the very get-go... - I can't call the police. If Ravik finds out, he'll go back to Chicago and kill my mother. - Then let's call your mom and tell her to get the hell out! How much longer do you think it's gonna be before this guy figures out where we are? Collins... Collins... Oh, he is a doctor, hmm? MD. Works at Harbor General Hospital. Harbor... ...General... - Here you go. - Thanks. - I've been... thinking about everything. - I never meant to hurt you. I hope you understand that. - I do know that. - I'm sure you're thinking that you built this life with someone... with me... and you don't even know who I am. - I know who you are. You're the mother of my child. A great mother and a terrific wife. You... have stuck by me and been there day and night for years. I know who you are. You're the woman I love. Excuse me, Doctor? Hi. I know you're Dr. Collins' boss. The nurse said that he didn't come in today, and I was hoping maybe you could tell me where I might be able to reach him. - What's this about? Well, it's about tax documents. These have to be signed, notarized, and postmarked to the IRS by 5pm. It's very important. You see, my partner...their CPA... he had an emergency, and he asked that I please take care of this. It's, um, it's vital. - Look, I don't know. It's... - Doctor, obviously it's confidential, and I can't divulge the content, but... ...if Dr. Collins and Kate don't sign these by 5pm, they will lose their home. It is that important. - OK, look. I don't normally give out information like this, but they went to his brother's cabin up at Lake Weston. - Thank you. Lake Weston. Well, he's not answering his phone. Maybe I should just go up there. Do you have an address? - No, but apparently it's close to a little tackle store on the west side of the lake. - West side of the lake. OK. Thank you very much. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. Thank you. - Police! Don't move! Put the gun down! Now! Put it down! On the floor! Suspect down. Let's get the paramedics in here. Check him for weapons. - Kate! Kate! Are you all right? - Yeah. - Are you OK, baby? It's over. It's over. - Yeah. - You OK? - Yeah. - Look, if it weren't for your cooperation today, we never would have caught him. Thank you. - You were right, though. He was not gonna let anyone take him into custody. - Suicide by cop. - We should let Wes know that everything's OK. - Yeah. I will. - And tell him you did a great job feeding Ravik with the information we asked him to. - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. Is that Mom? - Yeah. Hello? - Hey, it's me. It's all done. Ravik... Ravik is dead. Thank God. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm OK. Everything went as planned, I guess. And how's Oliver? - Just a sec. Here. - Thanks. Mom, is someone ever gonna tell me what's going on? - Yeah, sweetheart, we are. Your dad and I are on our way home right now. We love you so much. - Is this it? Is this Grandma's house? - Sure is, champ. - And whatever she's serving for dinner, you're gonna like it. - I know, Mom. You already said that. - You got it? - Yep. Come on. Did you get your bag there, buddy? - Go ring the doorbell. - There you go. I can't believe you're actually here! - I can't believe it either. I never thought this day would come. - David, I have heard so much about you. - And I recently have heard a lot about you too. It's great to have a new mother-in-law. - Thank you. Ohhhh, buddy! - Can I call you Grandma? - I would like nothing better. Do you like cookies? - Yes. - Well, I just made your mother's favourite kind. - Oh, did you? Oh, Mom. I think you're gonna like these. - Should we go get some? Come on, let's go! - I love you so much. - I love you. And I'm so happy for you. Closed Captioning bySETTE inc
