Room was locked from outside with another padlock The hotel staff had to break in The body was found hanging There are fatal wounds on his body, I am told There was a pool of blood in the room [SHE SNIFFLES] Is there some gold missing? Was he carrying gold? Who's crying there? The police is questioning the hotel staff They are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar We can't trust them They are very dangerous [SUSPECT SCREAMS] Who broke the lock? Jayant Sakhalkar will be the IO in our case He is known to me He is a shrewd guy, very efficient He has keen academic interest in such cases Academic interest means what? - Some inanity Have it I don't want - Have it Hey, Kurup - Yes, sir Come on in - I'm coming So, this Trissur is India's gold capital! Nice You don't know Hindi? - A little bit So, tell me madam, How much gold was he carrying? See, whatever figure you tell me now, That much I can give you back... ...once I find it. So, give me the exact figure Let me discuss it with them and tell you later Great, OK Well, I've told him...that this case has to be investigated very fast There is this journey, from Trissur to Chembur- Kannan's journey That's very important in this case So, we have to travel back to Trissur and look for evidence to investigate Normal government procedure will take time What he says is that the normal procedure is time consuming If you can meet the expenses, he can make it fast Muthu... what to do? - What? He will come and do everything if we can pay We can do what ever... That's fine, sir We will meet the expense It's by itself a gold case also The gold can vanish like this [RECITING RAMAYANA] [CHEERING FROM TABLE FOOTBALL] Move forward ... Stop it stop... Hey hey ... its gone ... gone... Oh... yes... Let's set it up here... - OK [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Look, I don't have the exact figures Do not bother about it now, It' will be better to tell them the truth Who is Keerthy here? Hello, Keerthy I am Inspector Jayant Sakhalkar from Chembur Hmm... - We've met, no?...yeah They are my colleagues- Yashpal, Anshuman, Bhaskar... This is Morey and he is Alex He will translate the conversation How was your family life? We were living happily What was his financial situation like? We do have some debts now, but it's better than it was before We made it through, repaying Now we are way better, financially Yeah... he does have some debts But those debts are mine as well Muthu, How exactly do you run your business? Well,, we have a supply chain up to Mumbai We make jewellery here and supply the merchants They provide us with the pure gold The jewellery is made by mixing copper with the gold Our profit is a percentage of that copper It may appear lucrative to outsiders, but... It's not as profitable as iron or so... So, you say that there is no gain from this business Not that we don't make anything we started from the scratch From this alone, he could build a house and marry off his sister I also make a decent living from this Don't you know about the risks involved? Hmm... Yet you did not try to stop him Yes, risk is there... no business is risk free For instance Kannan's father He was running a tea stall in Coimbatore, totally risk free Then there was a bomb blast Kaboom - the end After some days I tried starting another shop That too did not take off What should I have advised him, being a loser myself? What we see now is the result of his hard work You know, nothing is completely legal here He was very studious, but... I could not give him proper education He was a smart guy, he knows three or four languages Nobody could say no to him All I have is the craft Kannan was handling the sales and marketing How did Kannan get this mark on his back? It's of an offering ritual, sir He used to perform hanging- a flesh piercing ritual- every year I am not surprised of his fate His stars were not all aligned He was a 'cursed Capricorn' by birth This was the final one of his lives He had to endure all of these pains before his death... ...as he does not have another life Who is this Arul? - He is Kannan's friend He lives in Coimbatore and has paid us visits on occasion They were classmates up until ITI, then we moved here We used to meet at our room when we visited Coimbatore Why didn't he come, Arul? He told me that his mom was in hospital. May be because of that His mother was not feeling well So, he is not your friend? - No, I know him, that's all I've met a lot of them He does business all the way up to Mumbai, and knew many such guys Can you recollect your last conversation with him? Erh... he had called me when got there in Mumbai Told that he was waiting sister Ambika to arrive He also told me that pending bills were all cleared ...and had promised me to call by the evening, but couldn't reach him after that How much gold did he have when he left here? I don't know exactly, but he had taken 'two' from me There were some pending stuff to collect en route He had told me that he got those, if that's the case... ...it must have been around 8 kilograms His plan was to collect it on the way and wait for us in Mumbai We were to stay in Mumbai and send the gold with Manikkuttan. Who is this Manikkuttan? - He is one of my helpers Could you object if we said you and your boys killed him for the gold? Sir...please sir... What happened? Don't speak like this, son, You risk being cursed You are mistaken; simply ask around about me in Trissur, you will get to know Don't say things like this... Sir, he is crossing the limits Is it, Alex? Why are you crossing the limits, man? Sorry... Look madam, especially in these gold smuggling cases... I have studied ...that the closely associated people, they only give the tip to the criminal You, Arul, Bijoy, Muthu, you all are aware of Kannan's journey Right? OK - Yeah So isn't it normal to suspect you all? Ask him about the Muthupettai incident - OK Kannan told you he was going to Salem but ended up in Muthupettai instead There is a small confusion in it I heard him saying that he was headed to the Salem route I took it up with Muthu, but he said other wise See, that's how this business works The gold riders won't disclose their route, as there could be snitches around He won't tell me, or even his wife We won't ask, either You say, it was his friend who slipped with the gold from the car Do you know him? Kannan has several friends in Coimbatore It's his home town It must be somebody he trusts, or else he would not have given the stuff You didn't ask his name? - No, I did not Why didn't you ask him After being involved in such an incident? Do you recognise the person? It's Kannan -Hmm... Kannan is seen leaving the lodge just after checking in He was being followed when he returned Do you recognise the person following Kannan? No, sir... No... No? Is that Kannan's bag? Is it? - Yes it is Sure? - Sir So, he is the one who did it, right? [GULPS] What are you thinking, Muthu? Share it with me Share it, man About him...what else to think? Have a drink If you try to console me, I will smash your face Hands off me... -OK They were childhood friends ...and classmates up until ITI before we moved here So his mother is telling that... Kannan's father used to run a tea shop in Coimbatore That's when Kannan and Arul studied in the ITI together Why did Arul skipped the questioning? Is he lying about his mother's illness There is something off in it You too felt it, right? - Yes... [PHONE RINGS] Hello... Muthu, Alex here - Tell me, sir We need to go to Coimbatore tomorrow - Sure, sir But why? - By 8 AM [LINE DISCONNECTED] [SINGING AN OLD HINDI SONG] Have you seen him? Mammootty and Mohanlal [A WOMAN COUGHS] [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] [DOOR OPENS] Brother... - Arul... They are Maharashtra Police They are investigating Kannan's case [SHE COUGHS AGAIN] Come on in [COUGHING CONTINUES] Why didn't you come for his funeral? Mom was unwell, that's why...

There was this guy who fled the scene with his phone You had called to his number that day They want to know who that guy was Tell them I don't know, brother. I was calling Kannan I couldn't talk to him as the signals were weak and his voice kept breaking Voice break? So the voice was breaking for the entire 45 seconds?

He is lying...Tell him that he has to come with us Look sir, I am telling the truth, sir The voice was not clear What's the problem? - It's nothing uncle Nothing to worry about, these are people I know There are police men out side, that's why I am asking Not an issue, I will explain later You may please leave now OK, we will be outside You go out...out I am telling the truth, sir I could not talk to him properly, sir Arul, you will have to come with us We have some questions for you Why me, sir? - Why?

What exactly were you two talking about? Sir, even if you ask me about yesterday's events... I won't be able to recall them So how can I respond if you ask me about something from the past? You don't remember? - No, sir Obvious, no? - Yes...sir Vicky, come here, I will tell you a secret Tell me. sir Well, I am not at all interested in you But I will take your girlfriend to Mumbai and interrogate her... Unless you tell me the details [HE SCREAMS] Sir...sir... it will may cause trouble - Relax Sir, you can't do this... - It's OK, It's normal Better you tell me the details otherwise I will press the accelerator more [MUFFLED GROAN] Sit...sit, please sit [HE GROANS] It was Abbas bhai who called me from that phone He was stranded there and wanted me to pick him up and drop off at Coimbatore Now where is Abbas? - I don't know, sir Anshu - Yes... Is this him? No, sir...this is not him No? - No, sir... Sir, this is Abbas, sir - Are you sure? Yes sir, he is a wanted person who has a bounty on him Hmm... Anshu, get his phone number Give your phone number to him Muthu, it's the same person It's not him - Oh, that's him for sure- Abbas I see...it's just him...He must have been on a diet, he has shed a lot of weight I did not even recognise him - Really? So thank you, bro - Thank you, sir If the Muthupettai guy and the one on the CCTV are the same... So...? I was just thinking - Where are the cigarettes? Finished, I guess Why didn't you buy some? I really needed one Madhu, please buy a couple of packets - OK Feeling sick? There'll be a nice sea breeze if you open the window [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE RINGING] What's the matter? - Brother, where are you? Somewhere in Tamilnadu, don't know the exact location Sister Ambika had come the other day for the rituals of Kannan Hmm... She says, it was his friend who fled with the bag from Muthupettai But what he told me was ...that the man in the car was a hitchhiker, who fled seeing the police Do we need to inform the cops? What should I do? Hello... brother... I am getting another phone call, it's them, the Police You need not worry, I will handle it OK The person we believe to have followed Kannan from Coimbatore to Mumbai and... ...murdered him, is the same guy who was with him at Muthupettai- Abbas, his friend How could a close friend have secretly followed him for so long? Do you notice anything unusual about Kannan's steps in the video? He is not being followed... Isn't he trying to shield the man behind, from the camera? But why? Kannan had a plan That plan could have involved nicking the gold... ... from Ambika's men with the help of this Abbas However, Abbas is seen leaving the hotel room with the gold all by himself There had been a last-minute turn of events in the room Abbas may have found it easier to bump off Kannan and ... ... flee with the gold than dealing with Ambika's men Arul, the guy we took to Mumbai has not opened his mouth yet He was fully aware of Kannan's plan, we guess Not only him, all of his close friends knew about it, we are certain Did you know about it, Muthu? - I didn't know, sir Muthu... So you don't know? - I don't know Come on, Muthu? You were his best friend I am hearing it for the first time, honestly So, you don't tell me? - I don't know, sir Hmm... Ahem... See, Muthu...

Look he has committed a murder I will pick him, and take him to Mumbai I will thrash him like anything He won't be able to stand on his own for the rest of his life.

Bro, won't there be CCTV? That won't be a problem, you just wear a cap There was a police checkpoint on the way Go...go...fast He was very particular that the cops should not find us together As soon as we escaped the police... ... he left me at a deserted location with his phone and the bag He'd strictly told me not to use my phone during the journey It was Arul who informed me that the Muthupettai police had taken him Then I called Vicky, and got away from there The following day, Kannan and I took a bus from Coimbatore to Bombay Hey, what are you gonna do? - Wait... Hello sister...when are you starting from there? All pending items are collected ... all good How many of you are coming? OK, I will make the bookings Alright, then... [SIGHS] Get up, man...

The force should be there OK... Don't cut my fingers - Hey... Don't confuse me, I am losing concentration Sorry... I won't utter a word again [BREATHING HEAVILY] What if you scream in pain? Shall I put some cloth in your mouth? Don't bring any new ideas, do what I say Arh... [EXHALES SHARPLY] Don't think... OK... What are you doing man...Just slash me - Be calm... Arhh...

Open it. quick That's your share Thanks, bro... [ZIPPER RUNS] Ah... yes... [KERCHIEF FLAPS] Hmm... Hemm... eh... Bye, bro... In a city where more than 200 murders take place every year... ... gold agent Kannan's death at the Kamala lodge... ...also seemed like another perfect case of murder All the evidences were pointing towards a brutal act of violence A murder for gain... The door was locked from outside using another padlock ...and inside the room, it was a total mess Signs of struggle could be seen everywhere A deep cut wound was found on the body A rope was tied to the window as if the body was hung after killing ...also there were CCTV visuals ... which showed us the entry and exit of an unidentified individual... ...at the crime scene And Kannan's gold bag was missing too Although all these evidences were pointing towards a certain murder... A few facts were bugging me right from the beginning Why did no one hear even a slightest sound of this fierce struggle? Even after Kannan was attacked so badly! Also Kannan's blood stained prints were found on the switch board and the fan How did they end up there? So, once we caught Abbas and started interrogating him... Then only we were able to find answers to these questions And the postmortem report which we got the other day also supported our findings ...that Kannan's death was not a murder According to the findings of the police this is not a murder... ...but suicide But Kannan wanted to stage it as a murder I know, Kannan already had a lot of problems He was neck deep in debts He was worried about losing life savings... ... and his family being forced onto the streets He promised me 2 kg of gold from what he was planning to nick He wanted it to look like a robbery But, I did not expect him to take his own life With his years of experience in this field Kannan knew... ... that a simple made up story of robbery won't stick That might have prompted him take this decision Had he not been detained by Muthupettai police that day... Had there been no calls from that phone to trace,,, His plan would have been worked out, to a certain extend It would have looked like some one had followed him... ...and murdered him for the gold - Sir, one second... What is his gain in making this a murder? Oh...benefit? It's an expected question I will tell you... Tell him In your line of work, for a gold agent like Kannan... ...which is more likely to attract leniency- suicide or murder? Kannan didn't have much pending gold to collect, as he was claiming. Which means he had that much of debt to pay off They have already verified it with his merchants The only gold he had with him was... 2 kilograms ornaments which he took from Trissur in last trip He had to kill himself in order to prove that he had been robbed That's the truth What truth? He had no reason to take his own life He would have repaid if he had debts, He was such a confident guy He was my soul-mate He would have told me if he was that broken Otherwise, he would have told her, wouldn't he? Look... Muthu, please keep your emotions aside and listen to me Come on, Muthu, what should I do more to make you realise... Should I die like Kannan? - Enough, sir... enough We will move legally to get it re- investigated Come on...don't you have the contact of Joshy? Jai Hind, sir... Yes, sir... Arul, you are being called [INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER] [INDISTINCT BACKGROUND CHATTER] Uncle... Give me that... He had come to meet me before setting off to Mumbai Muthu... Please try to understand There are times when people lie to you Your own friends hide truth from you... They do this, just because they don't want to hurt you They show confidence only to hide weaknesses, you get me? Muthu, listen to me I had no other intention... - Get lost, you... What...? - He says, you may please go Was it a 'Please'? That did not sound respectful... OK...I get it. ...and by the way Muthu... I quite like you... You are too innocent ...and that's your problem... But what to do, I'm a public servant ...which makes me always one-sided I have to stand by the truth, no? [IN MALAYALAM] Now, you get lost... Sister... We must not admit that he committed suicide We must not... Are you listening, Keerthy? He used to lie a lot, brother I knew, I knew it... If we admit the fact, they will easily make it a suicide He did not want that I failed to stand with him, now is the time for it That's what love is all about Let him win... let him... For what, brother? He has gone, no? I don't have any other options I've run a long distance The finish line is getting closer In hindsight, I realise that I'd been on the wrong track We can't start over; right? the only option left is to finish this race I have to keep my family safe, that's all Bro... - Hey... Not to worry, everything will be fine If things go wrong, please give it to her Tell her that I tried my best, won't you? ♪Oh, the spring of the soul-woods, where sorrow and happiness co-exist as creepers♪ ♪ The treasure in a cave sought by both the destitute and fortune seekers ♪ ♪ Oh the dream lake, formed in the veins of a wasted city ♪ ♪ Oh Goddess Lakshmi, you may embrace the reborn serenity of countrysides ♪
