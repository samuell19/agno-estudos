What are you doing? Why do you stare at women? If some day there's a fight, both of us will get thrashed! Sameeran had asked me to meet her here. I'm looking for her. -Excuse me... -Is this a joke? Where are you going? Return the wallet! Son, why did you beat him? For this. It's yours. Good grief! My money! May he be ruined! This is what he did under the pretext of begging! Give him two more blows on my behalf. Spare him. He's a poor man. Thank you. -Where are you? -Goodness gracious. May Lucknow always prosper. You do always find a good face. -Pardon me? -Did you see? See what? The one who promised didn't turn up. Forget her. Look at this one. I swear she's beautiful! Look there, that's the one! She's removing the veil! Like the moon in the clouds. Mother, you keep these. -So Cupid's arrow has found you. -Who is she? I'm not a detective to know everyone in this big city. We must find out. Let's follow her. We'll find out her family's address too. Come on. Stop. Did you nab a pickpocket? -Yes. -And let him go? He's been caught. Come and identify him. We don't want to get involved. -That's your job. Come on. -No, sir. You can't leave. Let us go. Our family has already left. Let them go. Come along or you too will be locked up. This is great. -He won't give up. -How about her... Let her go home or we'll land in prison. The night of Friday night. It's my responsibility. -Good day sir. -What a nuisance! -What are you doing? -It's me! Sameeran? What are you doing here? I was looking for you at the fair. I came to meet you but this rascal pinched my wallet. You go on home. I'll sort him out. Let me see... So it's you! He's after the ladies today. Write the report. He's the same pickpocket... -Your name? -Mizra Masaraddik Sheiza. And your father? -So you're the inspector's son? -Yes. Okay, that's all right. Keep my shoes there too. I'll hit no less than 250 times. Not one less! Let the young man come. -Keep your shoes too. -Very well. -Father, keep my shoes here too. -Sure keep them. These are enough to crown him. Mother, today brother will be crowned with my shoes! Shut up! -Young man... -What's the matter? -Don't go in. -Why? Do we have women guests? No, arrangements have been made to crown you. But why today'? News came from the police station at the fair that you stare at women in veil. And try to glimpse their faces. -So...? -So your father is furious. He has collected the shoes of the entire neighbourhood. It begins! Don't you dare run away! Ramzani! Bring the rascal in! Go in. For God's sake! Good God, rid me of this pain. But this pain won't go away. Brother, Good day. -Quiet! -Come here! She's an enemy of her brother! Do you see these? Father, I only see darkness from here right to there. You'll be showered with so many shoes that you'll come to senses! -I will lose my life. -That would be even better! It's better to be childless than to have kids like you! From where should I begin? This part or that? Father, if you must crown me, then begin from here. Here? -Think of the shoes, if not my head. -That's what I will do. It's a hand! And I thought it was the shoe! You've driven my son bald beating him with shoes. Mother, see this... Mother, have the crowning ceremony delayed for another day. So I make a mistake again. Let him go. He won't do it again. There you are! You're spoiling him! Father, I promise, I will never step anywhere near the Dargah Sharif again. This chap is such a nuisance! He has made a joke out of me! He has given you his word, hasn't he? And I ask you to forgive him. -May I leave, father? -Scram! Mother, may I come in? Son? Come in. See what I've got for you. Something from the holy shrine. May you have a long life. You care so much for me. Mother, I also prayed for you... that you would get the opportunity to go on the holy Haj pilgrimage. Amen. That will happen, but why didn't you ask for a bride for yourself? -That would have been refused. -Brother... Do me too a favour. This is the list of guests. My birthday is on the day after tomorrow. This is my daughter's first birthday since she to got married. We'll have a grand celebration. Let's see the people she has invited. You've invited everyone but I don't see Aslam and Shaida. Why? Here, right at the end. Not at the end. Their names should be right on top. He's my son's childhood friend. For me, they are like you. In fact call Shaida's parents too. -That leaves Aslam... -My dearest friend. I also like him because he has nobody in the world. -He has neither mother nor father. -Don't say that. I'm his mother. Your late father used to say... "he who has found a good friend, has found everything" God bless the three of you and your friendship. Have the invitations printed and distribute them. Naseeban... Where has everyone gone today? There's not a soul around. There's enough food. Don't grab or fight. Children, eat as you wish. Go for it! Let's eat in that room. Nobody will come there. Nice place. Let's sit here. Such a soft mattress. Join me. Great fun sitting here. -Whose picture is that? -That's Rehana's brother. -Why? -I think I've seen him. -In your dreams. -Him and in my dreams? He probably thinks no end of himself. He has hung a huge portrait of himself in this little room. The picture is not all that bad. Maybe not for you. Come here, I'll show you. First, look at his forehead. Like an old unrepaired road of the municipality. And the nose is like a roasted egg-plant on a slice of burnt bread. And the mouth is a letter box. -In which you drop letters. -Don't say that. If Rehana hears us, what will she say? We're eating her food and insulting her brother. I say if this chap appears and gets angry, I'd... -hit him hard... -Goodness me! What have you done? Wait! Wait! This is terrible! Don't tell Rehana. You'll get a bad name. -If he tells Rehana? -No way, silly girl. Man goes crazy when he gets a thrashing from a woman. -Understand? -Yes. § शरमा के ये क्यूँ सब पर्दानशीं § § शरमा के ये क्यूँ सब पर्दानशीं § § आँचल को सवारा करते है § § शरमा के ये क्यूँ सब पर्दानशीं आँचल को सवारा करते है § § There are men § § who stealthily take a look § § There are men who hide and take a look § § Tell those yearning eyes § § it isn't nice to mess with beauty § § Tell those yearning eyes, it's not good to mess with beauty § § if you must come before someone in a veil § § come with your eyes lowered § § For even life bows to those who are beautiful § § He who walked into a gathering of beautiful women § § went with great style § § But the moment he exchanged glances § § he lost his life § § Tell the yearning eyes not to mess with beauty § § They are all grace and poise § § and yet, they leave you one short of death § § Why do those in veils readjust their cover? § § Beautiful women would have had no seekers § § had there not been those admirers § § Had it not been for the eyes, the sights held no significance § § Beautiful women would have had no life worth living § § Beautiful women would have had no seekers § § had there not been those admirers § § To maintain the dignity of women § § they undergo every atrocity § § There are those who hide and look at women § § Tell those in love not to provoke moon-faced beauties § § Tell them to keep away from beautiful women § § Should they be pleased, they will give you love § § should they be cross, there would be carnage § § Tell those in love not to provoke moon-faced beauties § § They happily take the daggers in their heart § Brother! You! I was looking for you. I got you a beautiful necklace for your birthday. Yes. -This is very bad. -What? I'd lose face if someone had spotted you. And I'd be maligned. No friend will come here. I'll go and tell mother. -Don't tell her. -Then don't come here. All right. Go about your work. -Naseeban... -What? -Will you do me a favour? -Lots of favours. There's a girl there... Plenty of girls there. -No, the one with the eyes... -All of them have eyes. -Will you let me speak? -Okay. I'll give you a broad description. The girl with the satin scarf. With the flowers? Oh yes. -Here's a piece of it. -Where did you get this? I'll tell you later. Find out about her. -Don't you squeal. -No, sir. I wouldn't dare! -But... -You'll get it. Do the job. Why are you standing here? Look at them having fun. Everybody is exchanging scarves. Give it to me. -Let us exchange ours. -But mine is torn. -What will you do with it? -Doesn't matter. -What is it? -Nothing, lady! Where have you trapped me! -Congratulations, Bano! -What for? I won't tell you... but you must take the hint! She's crazy! -What news have you brought? -They're from our very own locality. She's the daughter of that gentleman from Agra. -Are you sure? -Of course... I used to work for them before I came here. They're a nice family. He has seven sons... -this is the only daughter. -Do you know the girl well? But of course! I don't find time from my chores... or I used to visit their house every day. Really? That's great! Here's your reward. I'll tell you what I want to tell her in a couple of days. -Understand? -Absolutely, sir! Give that piece back to me. My heart will be at rest. -Such is your pining? -Are you in there? You may leave. Come in. -Have you come alone? -No, sir. He's got me along too. -Salutations! -Aslam! Where had you vanished? I was quite busy but I had to make it today. It's Rehana's birthday and on hearing your news from Shaida... I had to drop everything and come to congratulate you. You stone hearted brute... you have finally melted! -When are you saying it with sweets? -Right now. I mean, at least not till next Thursday. That won't be necessary. She's... Rehana has sent this and has wished both of you. I understand. In answer, give her this. And this is from me. -Now tell us. -She has come for the party. I was asking Naseeban when you guys landed up. I've found out that she's the daughter of Agha Nanhe. Take a look at what I've got from her. You're terrific! But where did you get this piece? Don't even ask! Cupid's arrow again? Even on the back. What? What a lashing! She must have given it hard. -What are you doing? -You're a third class lover. Scared of a whip lash! And look at me. I only haven't experienced a cannonball. -I've been hit by everything else. -I'd have died of shame! -Actually... -Forget it. Now that we know the girl, let's fix the marriage fast. Give it a good thought. They might turn down the proposal. What rot! Nobody in the whole Lucknow can turn down Aslam. -Shall we go tomorrow? -Yes. Each minute is painful. There goes another bachelor. As for you... God take care. I am leaving. -Where are you taking this? -The wound reminds me... burn this scarf, mix it in butter and apply it on the wound. What about his education? -He has done his Masters in Arts. -Very good. -How about his health...? -Pardon me... -I mean, does he play games? -Games? -Of course! He plays it very well. -What game is that? He's got to carry 2 men on his back and run for 2 miles. Very good. Funny are these games and their names. Now tell me if they have some land or property... You don't have to ask. They have 2O homes and 7 shops here. They have 200 orchards of mangoes and guavas in Malihabad. Very good! Assume the proposal almost accepted. But let me ask my Dad. His decision is the final one. -Your Dad? -Yes, he has gone to see his Dad. Meaning your Dad has gone to his Dad's house? -That's right. -Very good! -Shall we return next week? -Yes, that's perfect. Sounds as if the whole family is living on nectar. Let's go. Show me your pulse. -Please, step this way. -Right away. I don't know the importance of pilgrimage in your religion. But I wouldn't advise her to go on Haj. The illness has made her very weak. She needs rest. Please have her pilgrimage postponed. Somebody else could be sent in her place. Haj can be postponed in sickness or unavoidable circumstances. If somebody else goes in her place, they will reap the rewards. In my opinion, this is right. Sir, if you would agree to go... I would be grateful. As would my mother. -I don't mind but... -What is it? I'd like to talk to your mother. Please go in. Announce your arrival. I'll show the doctor out. Come along, doctor. -How are you feeling? -Thank God, I'm well. -What did the priest say? -He was willing. He wanted to go in my place but he has a young daughter. How can he go without getting her married? He was not clear but he did express it. -He'd like her to marry you. -Marry me? I too would like both of my desires fulfilled together. Your wedding and my Haj. His daughter is simple, beautiful and one in a million. But mother, this is contrary to your word. You gave me the liberty to marry anyone. So why this? My son, that is how the situation is. Don't you want me to do the pilgrimage? If I was well, the doctor wouldn't forbid me from going. -One can't trust life. -Don't say that. What if I present someone else instead of me? I mean somebody better than me in every respect. My son, nobody is better than her own child for a mother. -Shall I call for the priest? -No. Not yet. Give me time to think. Okay, but there's very little time. We must give the priest an answer by tomorrow. All right. Let go! Please, Father, I swear I was going to say my prayers! You and read prayers! Where were you going? I have just one aim. My beloved.., where else? -What are you doing here? -I came to ask you something. -Want to get married? -With my beloved? No, to the girl I wish. You're foolish. The man who fools his Dad for his girl and fools the world. Why would he marry the girl you choose? -Think about it... -All right. Give it a thought. Who could it be at this hour? Great. Please come in. I knew it. You would fall in love, and I'd bear the brunt. -It's something else. -Really? Sit down. You could've called me. Why did you bother at midnight? It's one and the same thing. Does it matter that I came? Or have I disturbed you? You haven't slept. What were you doing? -Accounts. -What of? Of your obligations. Today they are seen in the form of respect and honour. What do you mean? Won't you let me sit? Shall I leave? From this house? Which your kindness has helped build? I had lost everything. I just have life. I wouldn't even have that if you hadn't saved me. I'm not worthy of anything else. At least let me say it. Are you through? Now may I say why I came here so late? Yes, please do. You know mother has two desires in her old age. One is getting me married. The other is to do the Haj. -Her trip had been organised. -I know. The problem is these days she has become very weak. The doctor says she mustn't undertake the trip to Haj. I see. So...? It has been decided to send someone else in her place. We spoke to the priest and he's even willing. But the problem is, he has a young daughter. And he can't leave till she's married. Her wedding can't be arranged anywhere so fast. -So mother wants me to marry her. -You? Yes. And you know why I don't want to. If I marry the priest's daughter, all my dreams will be shattered. So what do you suggest? My friend, if you don't want to see my joys being ruined... in fact, if you want to save my life from ruin... You must marry her. Is that all? I'm ready right away. This is what I expected. You're a true friend. I'll go and tell mother. Let me make this clear. I haven't seen the girl. But I've heard she's good. Make up your mind. This is life. I'll be a groom before you. If I'm lucky, my bride will be better than yours. You'll feel jealous if you ever see her. § मेरा यार बना है दुल्हा § § और फूल खिले है दिल के § § अरे मेरी भी शादी हो जाये दुआ करो सब मिल के § § आज की खुशिया देख के मेरा दिल भी ले अंगडाई § § मेरे भी घर हो धूम धडक्का § § और बजे शेहनाई § § आज की खुशिया देख के मेरा दिल भी ले अंगडाई § § मेरे भी घर हो धूम धडक्का और बजे शेहनाई § § मैं भी सेहरा बाँथ के बैठू बीच भरी महफ़िल के § § मेरा यार बना है दुल्हा § § और फूल खिले है दिल के § § अरे मेरी भी शादी हो जाये दुआ करो सब मिल के § § ऐ मेरे मालिक मेरे दत मेरे पालनहारा § § यार को तूने दुल्हन दे दी रह गया मैं ही कुवारा § § ऐ मेरे मालिक मेरे दत मेरे पालनहारा § § यार को तूने दुल्हन दे दी रह गया मैं ही कुवारा § § मुझको भी मेरी बुलबुल दे दे हाये § § मैं भी हसूँ खिल खिल के § § मेरा यार बना है दुल्हा और फूल खिले है दिल के § § अरे मेरी भी शादी हो जाये दुआ करो सब मिल के § § ऐ मेरे हमदम रहे हमेशा तेरी सलामत जोड़ी § § आज तेरे सेहरे ने भैय्या, मुझपे क़यामत तोड़ी § § मेरी भी आँखों में जागो ओ § § ऱव्वाब नई मंज़िल के § § मेरा यार बना है दुल्हा और फूल खिले है दिल के § § अरे मेरी भी शादी हो जाये दुआ करो सब मिल के § § बालम से मिलन होगा § § शरमाने के दिन आये § § मारेंगे नजर सैया § § मर जाने के दिन आये § § बाबुल का मोरे आँगन बिछड़ा § § छुटी रे मोरी सखिया § § नीर बहाए घुंगट् में मोरी लाज की मारी अंखिया § § मोरी लाज की मारी अंखिया § § बचपन के वो दिन गुइया § § याद आने के दिन आये § § बालम से मिलन होगा § § शरमाने के दिन आये § § पी संग मोरे नैन मिलेंगे § § धडकत मोरी छ्टीया § § मन ही मन में डोलूँगी मैं तो § § प्रीत की सुन के बतिया § § मैं तो प्रीत की सुन के बतिया § § थामेंगे सजन बैया § § बल खाने के दिन आये § § बालम से मिलन होगा § § शरमाने के दिन आये § § मारेंगे नजर सैया § § मर जाने के दिन आये § I won't compel you to show me your face.

This is the greatest favour Pyare Miyan has done me. I'm dead! I'm really ruined! What would you know of love? -My body is on fire. -Yes, sir. -Possibly. -I'm foaming at the mouth! -Does your mouth ever foam? -No, sir. Not me. My father's mouth would smoke. -When he puffed at the pipe. -Go away. -Go and get some message! -Be patient. It's only till evening. She has agreed with difficulty. Her father is going out tonight. -This is the best chance. -You're the very best. -What time? -She's called me at dusk. I'll meet you there. Just be around in the garden. If my job is done... I'll give you this diamond ring. -See how happy my heart is. -Let's see. Goodness me! This is beating as fast as a rail engine. Silly woman, that's my watch. The heart is on this side. But my father's heart is on that side... Don't be silly. Now go. -What's the matter? -Nothing. I was asking how Aslam's wife is. She was praising her a lot. When I told you, you didn't pay heed. Anyway Aslam too is like my son. She may be from a poor family but she's one in a million. I want one who is one in a billion. Everyone who sees her won't keep his eyes off her. I swear she's so pretty that the house will light up. Then we'll have to remove the lamps. -Now you're joking... -Tell me who she is. No. No fun if I have to tell you. -She'll take your breath away. -She's taken yours away. -Hurry up, son. -Don't worry. It'll happen soon. Don't wait up for me tonight. I'm having dinner with Aslam. My fate has looked up. You are so beautiful. Allah! Don't flatter me. -Aslam! -They are here. Where are you? Congratulations! Congratulations on your marriage. -Have you liked your wife? -What do I say about your favours? Everyday I get weighed down in them. By God, what a bride you have chosen for me. I feel like kissing your hand. -Lay off! -Let me kiss this forehead. I love your destiny. Everything you do is wrong. You should have seen the gift before giving it. Jameela is one in a million. Mine is one in a billion. Ask him. She brings light to his life. My beloved is incomparable! Let's eat dinner. I have to go out. Dinner is served. God is my witness. I'm so very nervous. I won't be able to say a word when I face him. What are you scared of ? I'll be right there with you. I can't do this. Turn him down. Don't do that. He's already in love with you. The poor man is standing in the darkness near the kitchen. The maid hasn't left yet. She's doing the dishes. Not like this... This is better, you're looking great! This is what love does to a man. -There's a fire raging in my heart -Truly... -Has the fire cooled down? -Who is this insolent! Goodness! What was that? Madam! There are thieves behind the kitchen! You're imagining things. Go away. How terrible! I think we must leave. -No! -How can you go to her like this? -We'll say, it's your servant's doing. -Then keep sitting. Fine, if she comes or else dreams in the air. You stay here. I'll call him. -Where has she gone? -Must be busy. Your time has come! -Go on. -Sir, come on. -Who is she? -She's the one. No. She's not the one. Are you joking? God!

You should have stopped him. Who knew about it? He didn't tell anyone. We left your place after dinner and went straight there. He had tied up everything and sent Naseeban ahead. Apart from what happened, she wasn't the girl! The one Pyare saw in the fair and at home. -What? -Yes... God knows what trick Naseeban was up to. For no reason she wanted another girl to meet him. God knows why. Where is she? Ask her the reason behind this. She is missing. She hasn't come out of fear. Please, follow me. I say, sir, may we enter? Sure, come right in. Sit. -Feeling better? -The pain must have lessened. -How did he get hurt? -Salutations, aunt! I ask, how did he get hurt? Hurt...yes! He was running with a pot on his head. He was up front, I was following him. And 4 men with sticks behind me. Good grief! Did you go to steal something? No, this is a game. Nawab Wajidali Shah used to love it. But what is this silly game that's only played at night? It's played in the day but if you don't have time, play at night. There's no restriction. No more going out at nights. That's right! I'm in your shoe. Aslam, you're quite useless! I gave you his wife. And you can't find him a bride. Now hear me carefully. I want him married this year. Either you find one, or I'll marry him to anyone. I won't listen to you. We know this man can't live without the girl in the fair. Shaida and I will go to the fair to find her. I wore this one and he's seen it. He said I look ravishing. Keep this away. Who wants to kill? The trick is to make him fall for simplicity. Goodness me! What happened? Say something! -Scared you, didn't I? -My heart stopped beating. I almost died and it was fun for you! I'm the one who will die for your beauty. Go on. Tell me, is there another girl like you in this city? The city is huge. There must be hundreds. -I don't believe that. -So don't. Where are you off to? We're going to the fair, mother has called me. -I hope you don't mind. -Not one bit. In fact I'm going there too. We'll have great fun. Now I know why you were asking about pretty girls. But what can you do now? You're stuck with me. It's useless going there or looking for anyone. I swear by you, I've never been there. I'm going for the first time. That too for somebody else. Okay. Don't stare at good ladies like a hood. -I have that chance only today. -What do you mean? I'll confront you with my friends. I'll trouble you so much that you'll run away. -My foot! I'll be in veil. -Let's see. Let's see! Mother! My darling daughter! You look so good! -Jameela? -Greetings, brother. -Where have you been -There was no time. You too forgot me. Didn't check whether I'm dead or living. May your enemies die. You're talking nonsense. Both brothers will come for Id. Aslam is alone at the shop now. -Good day. -See you, son. Get ready, mother. We'll go to the fair together. Okay, but take off these ornaments. There are so many thieves there. Last time you got saved. Those were our ornaments. These are from your husband. Lose one and you'll lose name. People will misunderstand. -Okay, mother. -Wear small things. Don't let anyone come close. I'll call the servants. Only 5 pennies.

Not a day or two, better make it tomorrow or else... -Very well. -Bye. Thief! Don't let him escape! Hide this. Nab all seers and bring them to the police station. Hurry. Come on! I wonder what's wrong... -You'll be searched. -What? Let go! What's this? A camera? What's wrong? See that group of girls? The black one is yours. Go. -Return my camera. -In court.

God bless the giver and the one who doesn't give too. Mendicant! You rascals! Why did you nab a God's man? Fear God. Child, if they did they would not arrest me. But that's all right. I forgive this ass. -I'm leaving. -Where are you going? He's no seer. He's a crook! Look at this! So that's how it is. Looks like a family profession. He's pinched someone's camera. I'll open it. Maybe he's hidden something in it. -No! What are you doing? -Move! -Father! -Bend down you fool. I know I'm entitled to a beating. But we'd better do that at home? Quiet, you crook! Say. Why have you done this. I wanted to nab those who steal disguised as cops. Liar! I swear I'd have caught him if they hadn't caught me. I'll get the evidence now. I'll catch the culprit. What are you standing for? He can't be trusted. Catch him before he runs away! There he is! Catch him! He is the thief. Out with the moolah. -That's my purse! -This wallet is mine. -So...? -No, sir! Return my camera now. I bought the camera to catch this rascal red handed. And show it to you. But they spoilt everything. Come here, my son. Did you see that? Well done. Don't flatter me. I'm your son. Son, where are you going? Another matter to be resolved. No, sit with me. Get a cold drink for my son. Would you prefer something hot? Neither. Matters there must be turning soft. Good grief! Found her? In that carriage. Let's follow her. -Come along. -But Shaida...? Forget him. Hurry. -Why are you standing here? -She went in there. -This house? -Yes. Why are you surprised? This is my uncle's house. Sure, you're not mistaken? Don't be silly. It's the same girl in the black veil. I saw her myself. Does your uncle have a daughter? Yes, Naseema. -Is she pretty? -Yes, very. Give her my message and fix things up if possible. You troubled us so! The girl's here and you...! Hold the cycle. See you. It was so crowded and the dirt and grime...! May I come in? -Brother! -Come in. -Good day, aunt. -May you live long. Good day. Take a seat. You've come after ages. -You've forgotten us. -No, but I've been busy. Where are you coming from? Look at him pretend. As if he doesn't know. -Tell me, what the matter is. -Forget it. Your wife told me everything. You wagered a bet yesterday. You would make her confront your friends. And trouble her. What name did she take...? He was following her. Then we saw from the mausoleum... Then you joined him. You talked and made some signals. We pulled your leg so much that we had a great time. But why do you want strange men to see your wife? -It's not good. -That was a joke. Actually we were looking for you. Me? To scare me? Come home tomorrow and I'll tell you in front of the wife. Your wife too invited me and you too for the same day. -Tell me what it's all about. -Keep the veil. Then I'll tell. Aunt... God bless you, son! If that's the case, I'm ready. Shall I fix it? You won't cancel it? I'd give up the world for you. -No change. -Fine. § Heartless is my lover... § § he is a raging fire and the gentle dew § § He's cruel at heart.

If I heave a sigh, he grabs my throat. How crazily in love am I. I came flying on the wings of love. If madam hears you, she'll chop off those wings. How will she if I hide her scissors? One of my friends is married, the other is going to be married. Only I am left. Agree to marry me or else... -Or...? -Or... I'll go to the forests from here. With just one song on my lips. My beloved can be fire and ice. She's cruel within but looks vulnerable. What a coincidence, mother. I got Aslam married... and now he's get me married to his own cousin. Yes, son, this is life. That's what the books preach. Marriages are made in heaven. See this necklace. Isn't it beautiful? All ornaments look pretty but I think you must take them to Aslam. The choice of the couple will be best. They will get the bride to approve. They're related, you see. Well said. Give that to me. Wait... I'm sitting here and you're sweeping dust. -Go to the men's room. -Will you till I go? Good God! -Yes, mistress? -The Nawab has come. Rehana's brother. Tell him that my husband is at the shop. -Madam says... -What did she say? That he has gone to the shop. I'll leave then. Convey my regards. To both. To both? It's wonderful! Get up. -Is all well? -Get up first. -Come with me. -You won't tell me? What can I say? I died again today. -Talking in riddles again? -She is at your house! -Who? -Good Lord! Naseema! I'd forgotten I'd invited her for today. Mother said to get these approved by you and your wife. I opened the door and my life was made! Suddenly we were face to face. I was blinded. She cried and ran inside and I came to you with a thumping heart. Hurry. And whether she likes it or not, have this to Naseema from me. It's a gift for the sudden meeting. -Come on. -Very well. Let my manager come. There's nobody at the shop. He's just gone to the bank. He must be on his way. Oh no! Did he have to go to the bank now? -Sit down. -How can I sit? I'm losing patience! Then stay here. I'll go and make my wife and Naseema sit out. You open the door suddenly. You'll see the sun and the moon. When both shriek and run inside we'll decide whose wife is better. Live long, friend. Let's shake on that. -That's a great idea. -I'll move on. -On wings! -Sure. But don't go away before the manager turns up. -Go on! -Let me wear my shoes. Wife, dear... You...? What's this? How exquisite! It's beautiful! Have you brought it for me? I'll get it if you like it. But the Nawab has sent this one. -For whom? -Naseema. Where is she? First let her approve of it. She hasn't come yet. I've been waiting. What are you saying? She hasn't yet arrived. I'm not lying. The Nawab was here. He just opened the door and we were face to face. I cried and ran in. -You and he were face to face? -Yes. How am I to blame? The maid was sweeping my room and I went to the men's chamber. Then the Nawab may have seen you, not Naseema. -Do you know him? -Yes. We did meet. At his sister's birthday. I hit him so hard on his back so hard that... What a whip lash! She must have stung hard like a serpent! Why didn't you tell me? Why would a stranger's name come to my lips for no reason? What are you thinking? So what if he saw me? I'm not so bad. I'm not blind or deaf that they'd make fun of you. -It's not that. -So tell me. Get me some water. First what name did she say...? Some Nawab was following her... then we saw you join him. We pulled such a fast one that it was great fun. Water... Were both you and Naseema wearing black veils that day? Naseema was in white. I gave her my black veil to fool you. Why are you silent again? Did you wager another bet? That he can't see me and he did? This is insolence and bad manners. Don't say anything against him. -He's my dear friend. -Then tell me what's wrong. Nothing at all. -You didn't get me any water. -Good heavens! You just drank it. Get me some more. Here. You are worried because of me. I apologise. I shouldn't have gone to that room. Silly girl! I'm going to the shop. And this necklace? Should I give it to Naseema? You may keep it. Was there any dearth of problems that the manager doesn't turn up now? Your manager hasn't come. And you have returned. Say... did you asked her about the necklace? Wonderful! You've done a marvelous job! You're a friend! What are friends for anyway. I fell in love only supported by you and Shaida. I'd have been happy with the priest's simple daughter. You're what my heart seeks. She's one of a kind! Look at her! What a nose. Such beautiful features! -What's this? -She's a poor girl. Forget it. Not her! This is my love. My life.

He's calling you for breakfast. Breakfast? He borrowed the neighbors' shoes in the morning? Are you mad? Eggs, Sweetmeat... -Is it day or night? -Can't you see the sun? -Where did it rise? -In the east. Either this is not the sun Or the direction is not the east. How can Dad call me for breakfast? And eggs, sweetmeat? He's very happy with you. Now you even have a job. -He won't beat me? -No. You are responsible. I hope the plan doesn't fail. Come. In the name of God. Let your mother come. -Come on. -Where? Over there... -Good morning, father. -Join us son. What is this? Where's your fez cap? I was drinking milk in the morning. Must have fallen in it. How naughty your son is. I know him well. Sit down. Mother, you sit in between. I'm fine at my end. Now you may begin. I say, son, the Superintendent is very happy with you. I told him that story of how you nabbed the sepoy. He asked me about your education. I told him you'd done your BA and were studying law. -And he's working hard. -That is why he said... "bring him immediately. I'll appoint him as an Inspector". My son will become an Inspector! The son of an Inspector will be an Inspector, not a guard! I accept that, on one condition. -What? -I want 1O constables. I'll see that the scoundrels who have turned holy, sacred places into theater arenas I'll whip the skin off their backs! That's very good. If you work so hard, you'll rise higher than me. Strange! You came from shop, you tell. Your employee came with money. He waited for you till evening. Your employee said you haven't gone to the shop for a week. You didn't say anything to me. I'm facing a small problem. What's your problem? Problem... actually... Friends got cheated in evaluating a priceless jewel. If the matter is to be resolved now, one is bound to be destroyed. How is it related to you? Sit down. Let me hear you find a solution. I'll follow your advice. They were very good friends. Like Pyare, Shaida and I. One of them was in search of a jewel. He does find it unknowingly. But he doesn't know it's the same jewel. He handed it to the friend thinking it's just a stone. When the friend finds out this is the same jewel the friend wanted, that he's still searching for it... what should the friend do? I have to decide this. You're my wife. You must help me. Make the decision for me. I think the friend should return the jewel to him. That's what I thought. But what if the second friend changed the form of the jewel. He got it fixed in a ring. He considers it dearer than life. I hesitate to take a decision. Another name for friendship is sacrifice. The bigger the sacrifice, the greater the friendship. If you take any other decision, it will hurt your name. It will be as you please. -Good morning, sir. -You are an ass! Yes, sir. If you say it, it must be true. Why did you tell my wife I don't come to the shop? You told me to let you know at home, if there's any work. But how do you know I'm always sitting with her? Pardon me? Then I'm really an ass. -Be careful in future. -Very well. And this sample? -Keep it somewhere. -Very well. -Listen... -Yes? -Do you know any way... -Of what? Separating from the wife. You mean getting rid of her? There are thousands. -For example? -Alcohol. Debauchery, singing, dancing, fighting... going home after midnight. At times not going home at all. Vanishing, etc... In 2 days, the wife will get fed up and go to her parents. And her parents will ask for a divorce. There are other ways too. But whom are you asking for? If this is only done for show... I mean, the world thinks it's true... and he doesn't do anything. Then? Then what? Haven't you heard... it's better to be notorious than have no name at all. Go to my house this evening. And tell my wife I'll be late. Good God! So soon after marriage? Looks like a storm approaching. Where is Aslam? It's ten. Is he always this late? No, it must be something special. He may have some work. Where do you think he is? Munnibai! I swear I'll sell my house for you. Good evening, sir. What are you thinking? What is it? Your sister's husband is going to the brothel. -What is he doing here? -There's a pimp with him.

Our shop is famous for this. Good morning. Come in. You may leave. Let the clothes remain. You will be paid for what we choose. -Very well. Good day. -Good day. Wonderful! This is how one must prepare for weddings. Colourful! But what's with you? Joined the army? All thanks to your love. What fruits it yielded! You'll never come straight to the point. What do you mean? While searching for Naseema, I nabbed a constable. My father told the Superintendent and he was so thrilled about it. He called me for an interview and promised to make me an Inspector! Now tell me, isn't it because of your love? I've worn the uniform to start practicing. -That's great. Does Aslam know? -He's not to be seen. I came here to see him. I thought you'd be together. I haven't seen him for a week. I don't know where the rascal is. -Yes, he might be there. -Where? At my in-laws. Might have gone to see them. No. I went to the shop and was told he doesn't come to work. Something is surely wrong. I asked the employee, but he changed the topic. He kept putting it off. I think Aslam and his wife don't get along. Hence he's involved elsewhere. What are you saying? What are you saying? Don't you remember him praising his wife? That was in the beginning. Problems can rise soon enough. No problem. We'll check this out too. Give me this. Return it to me! By God! Which idiot filled the hookah? Sorry. You filled it? Look at yourself. You're looking so pale. But you will hide. Your brothers saw him at a brothel. Will they lie? Mother, even if this is true, I won't believe it. Till he comes and denies it. You're blind with love for your husband! You can't see his faults! If we don't nip this in the bud, we'll cry with our head in our hands! § § § § § § § § § § § दिल की कहनी रँग लाई है § § दिल की कहनी रँग लाई है § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § § Very good! Sir, why are your eyes brimming with tears? Nothing. Take what you think is right. I don't know the custom here. That's all right. You'll learn slowly. -Somebody has come. -Let them come. My aim is to meet others who frequent this place. Open the door. -Shaida? -What's wrong? You took ages to open the door. You are here? We've been searching you for days. -Were you looking for me? -There's a limit to a hunt! You've driven us round the bend! So I was right. You are getting involved. Listen carefully. Why I have come here... I am listening. I'm not deaf. You'll have to dance on the street for Nawab's wedding the day after. The procession will be grand. -Is the wedding so soon? -Of course. Why would you know about anything? -Do you know him? -Listen to her. -Have you heard of one life and two bodies? -Yes. Wrong. Absolutely wrong. It's one life and 3 bodies. Him, me and the Nawab. The one for whose wedding you have to dance. I'll make a move. Remember, my friend. You'll stay, won't you? Stay right on. I think you only have to start drinking. Might do that as well. Drink a couple of bottles. Hatred spreads in the garden of love. I'm glum and you think of poking fun. I'm leaving. You? And you? -Is all well? -All was well, but not any more. -What do you mean? -It's very clear. In two words... Either reform yourself or divorce my sister! If that's the case, hear me out too. My character is my personal affair. You have no right to interfere. As for the other, it has to do with your sister. You do have a right. But first answer my questions. If I do divorce her, what happens to her? We'll fight with Nawab. He cheated our father into going to the Haj. And married our sister to a numskull like you! -This is not fair. -Definitely. That's what I said. Is the Nawab ready for it? He has to be ready. Is this a joke? Fine. In that case, I'm willing to divorce her right now. By God, that too willingly. But on the condition, that she only marries the Nawab. And if he doesn't agree? No. Not till I die! -I see. You've come to kill me? -Undoubtedly. Just a minute. Don't worry. I won't kill you. You are dear to me. Take this. You won't be able to kill me with the knife. With the pistol you'll kill me in one shot. There will be no folly with this. Squeeze the trigger and leave. I'll be indebted to you! Kill me. Shoot! Wait! My master! MY Lord! Now shoot. Do you want to shoot my husband and plunge me in Hell? For the love of God, shoot! That's it? Scared? Because the sister is your own blood? Mother, you always taught me woman's heaven is at her man's feet. Today when I want that heaven, you raise obstacles! What sorrow do I have? Wealth? The cupboards are full. 7 of our generations never saw such money! If he comes home at night, stretches and dozes off. Do I get a chance to serve him? If he comes late at night" I'll wait up all night for him. Then I'll feed him like a slave. Press his legs till he sleeps. That's how I'll attain heaven! -Listen, dear... -No, you listen! And you too. I'm his servant not his wife! I can lay down my life for one smile from him. Now shoot and make both of us martyrs! Where are you going? Hear this before you go. What you thought was terrible. Don't ever show me your face again. Jameela is dead for you and you are dead for me! We're complaining to you because you fixed this marriage. And believe me, every word of what I said is true. I've heard that from Shaida. Now go home and convey my greetings to your mother. Also tell her, I'm alive not dead. Her daughter will not be hurt. -Believe me. -You are very gracious. Tell me how to stop this. That's what I'm thinking about. Sameeran did tell me. Each time he goes there, Aslam keeps repeating he asks for methods by which to be separated from his wife. You're a jerk! What's there to think? Actually he wants to marry Sameeran. He has no other reason for leaving his wife. Everybody knows that. Don't talk like this. My pants are falling off! That's what I'm saying. Use a trick or you'll lose your brain too! Lose my head? Mine or Aslam's? He has lost his head. And if Sameeran leaves, you too will go nuts. -But she's mine. -You really are a jerk! -That's how? -Ok. Sit here. I told you women are unpredictable. Some try to possess them knowingly, others unknowingly. I've had it! She'd always say, you threaten to be a policeman. Someday I'll vanish and you'll be left hunting. Right. Now what's the intention? If he likes Sameeran, she's his. I think if a friend can't make this little sacrifice, he's no good. Bravo! Well said. -You call this a sacrifice? -Yes. This is no sacrifice, it's murdering a friend! In fact, a mass murder. How? If both Aslam and Sameeran are in love, who gets killed? Mine, Aslam's and possibly yours too! -What have I done? -Listen. Sameeran only has to go to Aslam's house and these men will kill him. In grief, Aslam's wife will grab my throat. That is their old wish. But I won't marry my dead friend's widow. But yes, both the brothers will be shot dead by me. -Then...? -Then I'll be hanged! I will die, so will Aslam and the 2 brothers. Sameeran too will die. Not you, because you're shameless. But you'll be out of your mind for some days. Now tell me isn't it mass murder? My pant will surely fall off. You've frozen my blood. I mean Pyare, tell me what is to be done. What is to be done? Be brave and shut Sameeran's door forever. What? If I shut the door how will I get in? How will she get out to meet me? -Just think... -You never understand. I mean, for Aslam. I'll go to knock sense into him. -Ready? -Of course. At a place wherever stands to benefit! I'll change, take some papers from the police station and get there. I'm going to straighten it out! I'm a very inconsiderate man. I have put you to a lot of trouble. This thing about friends has landed me in a dilemma. I got so worried that I didn't know where I went. Yet the answer eluded me. That's my mistake, not yours. -What are you saying? -That's right. I should not have stepped into the men's section. When we did meet, I shouldn't have told you I'd seen him earlier. And that I had one day mistakenly hit him, too. That is what has put you in doubt. You thought he was here to see me. And that I had also... Wife! Don't talk like that. I made a mistake and you also slipped up. You have insulted me by saying such things. -And my friend's more than mine. -I swear, it's true. If you are worried about something, or have taken a fancy to someone else... bring her home. I'll stay like her sister. We will serve you with all our heart. You are so kind. The Nawab has come. -Send him in. -Good grief! Stay right here. I want him to see you. -Please let me go! -I want you to stay. Let me go. It's impossible! -For God's sake! -Come in. -Pyare Miyan? -I bind you by oath to let me go! Come in. Somebody open the door. Good day. -You're really in form. -Yes. I want you to do something. -Will you do it quietly or... -I see. -How domineering! -Hurry. My master, tell me the job. What must I do? Whatever Aslam has spent on you in all these days I mean cash, etc... -Give it to me. -Is that all? You could have sent somebody. I'd have given it. -Present it. -Right away. All right. Here you are. 10, 20...is this all? This is what he gave me the first time. -Then? -Then you came over. You said to remember he's your friend. Consider him like me. -Do you remember? -I do. Your saying this was enough. He often came after that. He tried to give me money. I didn't lift my eyes. He's a gentleman. If he ever said anything, it was with a deep sigh... "Can you help me forget my wife?" I still haven't understood this. -Can you explain? -You don't need to understand! Your doors should not open for Aslam henceforth. Understand? Call your madam. I said, I won't open it. Why must you call madam? You wanted to take advantage of Shaida's friendship. You are so blind that you can't see your path! You run away from me because you think I'm an obstacle! But this won't happen as long as you live. What do you want? Yes? To malign me? What do you want? You made a promise. You forgot me. You forgot the duty of a friend. I'm trying to do the duty of a friend, my friend. -How can I explain? -You can't. The way you behave is not the way friends must behave. Why do you want to ruin me and yourself What do you want? -Should I leave? -No. Now tell me, what's wrong with you. Why have you become like this? It's a trick played by destiny. But now I won't give you opportunity to complain. You've taken a load off my chest. Now I must leave. Get ready and come soon. There's so much work. I can't handle all myself. Tell your wife I arranged your marriage myself. There should be nothing lacking from her side for my wedding! Okay! What a coincidence. Why are you talking to yourself? You... I was thinking Naseema will get married tomorrow. Not your Nawab's? He... will face the music. Women are a nuisance for men. Like I am for you. Nawab was quite mad at you. Can this marriage somehow be canceled? Is that what friendship is worth? He scolded you for your good and you've turned into his enemy! You yourself arranged their wedding. Now you want it stopped. This marriage should be stopped. Else our friendship will be stained. Good God! Are you mad? Both families are full of guests. The city is agog. Collectors, judges... all have come. Marriage is no child's play. Mother, Nasreen, Azra, everyone has come. But Jameela and brother Aslam haven't turned up. They must be on the way. Maybe they are with the Nawab. Jameela says this wedding can't be stopped. No way can it be stopped. You must stop them. This will be the second betrayal of a friend. He gave you your life. Today his life is in danger. Though he brought it on himself. His precious jewel is with you. After knowing all, you're tying your sister's life to his. You will lead your life without Jameela with a stone on your heart. But you know he won't even let Naseema touch his feet. This will be a cross you'll bear all your life. This marriage will mean death for Nawab. Stop this wedding! How? There's only one way. My death. This marriage will be postponed because you're a close relative. After you are no more... Jameela can marry the Nawab. Can you make this sacrifice for your friend? Of course! Today is the wedding. I said, today your sister and friend are getting married. Won't you go? -I was planning on leaving. -Pardon? -You aren't dressed either. -I'll be in a moment. -Wife! -Yes? Wear the wedding dress. I want to see you dressed as a bride. Naseema is getting married and you're making me the bride. Don't argue. Time is running out. Before dying let me see you. Yes, mother? Son, you're perspiring. Take a breath. There's so much work and I'm all alone. What happened to your friends? Shaida is what he is. Aslam should have been here. He's not seen. -Must be on his way. -High hopes. He would have come 2 days earlier. You've done so much for him. But he's not ready to help you. No. My friends aren't like that. Something must have happened. I'll go and get him right now. Where are you going? Send a servant. Stepping out of the house is inauspicious for you. I'll be back in no time. I say, don't go... It will bring bad luck. Stop! Mother, my heart is beating hard. Jameela and Aslam still haven't come. Don't worry. I'll send somebody. Here I am! Now tell me what's to be done, given, taken... -Where's the Nawab? -No idea. -Sounds like Shaida -Yes. -Yes, madam? -Ask Shaida to come in. Today I'll crown him! Brother will be crowned! Great! The guests have arrived but the groom is missing. Where are you? Madam has sent for you. Me? Help me, God. -Good day. -Rascal! Now you come! No, I've been working since morning. Don't lie. Since yesterday you and Aslam are missing. -Pyare has gone to get him. -Is that so? Yes. I told him not to go, but he paid no heed. Quickly bring him back. That's all? Assume I'm already back. Place this ornament on the side. God! What's wrong with you? Now stop it. Everyone must be waiting. It's almost evening. Evening comes everyday. -But this evening.. -...will be the best! -For you. -And you...? This might be the last evening. Good grief! Why do you say that? One evening is yours and one is mine. -Where's Aslam? -God knows what's wrong with him. He's dressing his wife as a bride. Now you're a bride. You're very romantic today. What's the matter? You dressed me up yourself. Yet not once did you say, Good God! Your killing looks! -Lightning strikes. -Yes, it has struck. I will sacrifice myself for you! The world will see. What are you saying? Cover your face, then lift the veil like the first time. Beautiful! You're really beautiful! This is the greatest favour Pyare did for me. This is Aslam's wife! She's his wife! What happened?
