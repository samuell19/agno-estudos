Photograph lots of close-ups. - Found anything yet? - Just a collection of compacts. No fingerprints, inspector. Naturally... And no other leads? Here's the permission to remove the body. - So early? - The examining magistrate's in a hurry. Alright. The hearse is here, inspector. - Inspector... - Just carry on. - Are you finished here? - Yes, couldn't find anything. They were slashed with a blade... a very sharp one. In the area of the mouth and the chin... there are marks of a hand, like a vice. I believe the deed happened like this: He must have grabbed her like this... - and then the mortal cut. - And the other injuries? A series of uncontrolled stabs. But not to the living person... but to the dead body. To stab someone like that you must hate him... or be a maniac. Photographs were found next to the woman, showing her in the arms of a man. A lover, presumably. - His face was made unrecognisable. - It's possible. As soon as you're finished, doctor, I'd like to have your report. Certainly, inspector. In full detail. Shall we go? I examined the photos left beside the body. If we figure out why the man's face was erased... - we might have a lead. - Why not? The face was scratched away with a razor or something similar. We could blow up the photos to see if there are any moles or other blemishes. But then what? Should we ask every male in town to strip for us? I'd take a look around the environment of the victim. Right. But unfortunately, that's a very closed world. She was the wife of a general. You think her friends will tell us with whom she went to bed? And what do you intend to do now? I'll throw out the net... and hope we'll catch all the right fishes. You said, at the day in question, you had some tests done at the hospital. You're just wasting your time with me. I don't go to whores, and I pity the men who do. Poor fellows... Maybe you hate them. Isn't that right, Cleopatra? All men should be brothers. I really don't hate anybody. And why do you keep saying "murderer"? Could be a lady. And what would you be? One who doesn't get on anybody's tits. On the contrary... - Her husband, a general, untouchable. - Be quiet. Those losers. It's always us. Look who's coming. - Cleopatra, how's the Pharaoh? - Good one. - I got rid of the journalists. - They're always expecting a miracle. - If they were in our place... - Found out anything? No, these folks belong to a whole different circle. Well, I think it's no use, but keep interrogating them. - I'm going home. - Alright, inspector. Call me if you need me. The idiot's leaving... And we're supposed to spend the night here? - Are you paying for the business I lose? - Calm down. Now we'll type up a nice report. After that you may all go back to your honourable jobs. His job ain't too shabby either... What's bothering you? Try to stay calm. Relax... and stop worrying so much. Yes, it's easy to say that. This is worse than the mob. Just unbelievable. - No trace of her lover. - What did you expect? And who should name him? The betrayed husband? The parents? Think of the scandal. The problems are always for those left behind. Like me, for instance. The papers are attacking us, and the commissioner gave me hell. "Bring me some proof, and do it quick. Try harder, Capuana. But be very careful. Don't step on anybody's feet, I'm begging you." - That's the motto. - Do it. Make him happy. - What can it cost you? - And how should I do that? Every step I take is wrong. Today, everything's different. I can't question people anymore. That's the magistrate's job now. If you catch one, he won't tell... or shows up with his lawyer in tow. If they don't say anything, there's nothing I can do. Whoever the murderer is... how's it possible he didn't leave any traces behind? He's very smart and cunning. But these photos of the naked victims and their lovers... they have some purpose. They're our lead, our only one. Do you think he's from around? I think so, yes. He acted very skilfully. Didn't you say we have to leave here earlier? Unfortunately, yes. You know how it is with my husband. When he organises a bridge evening, he's furious when I'm late. I better get going then. But you should hurry too, Serena. First I have to make myself presentable, Gianni. To me, you already are. Did you know that you look best when you're naked? - Didn't anybody tell you yet? - What's this? An interrogation? You want me to confess? I won't fall for that. So you have been told that before. You don't seem to object, do you? Just keep playing with me. I'll see you soon. ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN FOUND MASSACRED AT THE BEACH. ALL POLICEMEN OF THE TOWN ARE LOOKING FOR LEADS... THAT MIGHT CONVICT THE KILLER. Your panic is absolutely unjustified. No one could recognise you in that photo. I advice you as your lawyer to stay calm. - Let them do their work. - But somebody knows about Serena and me. So what? That inspector is clever. He cares about his position and his career. Stay calm. He knows he has to move very carefully. - With the most guarded discretion. - But maybe he'll get the wrong ideas. With a butchered woman, the first suspect... - will be the lover or the husband. - Yes, that's right. But not in our circles. The first victim was the wife of a general. And the second one, your poor Serena, she had an important name. - One of the really important people. - And now? What should I do? Go on living like nothing happened. And if the inspector does show up one day... you call me right away. Hello father. I'm sorry. I thought you were alone. We're finished. I was about to leave. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - ls there a problem? It's not a problem. We can discuss it later. Don't take off, alright? Go and play tennis. Don't forget the bridge evenings. Business as usual. And try to stay calm. Alright, I'll do my best. But it's not going be easy... This second murder is a carbon copy of the first one. The murder weapon was the same, too. Everything matches the Fioravanti case. - Even the method used in killing her. - And the photos with the lover. How did the husband react? He's in a state of collapse. He didn't suspect his wife to be a whore. But are you sure he had nothing to do with the murder of his wife? Maybe he's just pretending. Maybe he was out for revenge. We checked his alibi. It's all in order. We're also keeping an eye on her lover. We know he consulted his lawyer... but nothing else, no misstep. It sure would be odd if he'd taken photographs of himself and his mistress... and then put them next to her corpse. Even if his face was erased. That's Gastone. The one who prepares the cadavers. He always laughs like that when he approves of his own work. Come. Have a look. You can't see the cut on her throat anymore. And also the other injuries. Look. You too, inspector. - Look. She's beautiful. - Gastone is an artist. A real artist. With wax and make-up he makes miracles. He loves his work. Now dress her, put her in the coffin, and set it up in the mortuary. Her parents will be here in an hour. How beautiful you are. Almost prettier than when you were living. Stop. - Rewind it a little. - Why? What did you see, Capuana? These are only people we already know. All of them suspicious. Go ahead. Stop. Keep it there. It's terrible. Poor Serena, she really didn't deserve to die like that. - Such a horrible death. - That's true. And her husband, did you see him? A broken man. Considering all the things the newspapers write, I'm getting nervous, too. You're nervous? And why should you be nervous? Because the papers say the killer is a crazed moral avenger... and it seems only logic to me that... You catch my drift...? I don't know what's there to catch. He only kills unfaithful wives. You're right, Barbara. You shouldn't be afraid, Franca... at least as far as I'm informed. I don't think that's funny. First Floriana... then Serena, and now what? Who's next? Nonsense, don't let this get into your head. Don't meet trouble halfway. It's about time. Can't we change the subject? Good, let's talk about men. It's not really worth the risk. Don't you think? - Do you? - Don't you as well? The husband's ruled out, and so is the lover. All in all, Capuana, we have absolutely nothing. Well... That's the way it is, commissioner. I have checked and re-checked. I could still arrest the husband if you think it's of any use. For Heaven's sake. Anybody, just not the husband. You know he's in the public eye. You see this phone? It hasn't stop ringing since yesterday. Many recommendations. Some real exquisite ones among them. You have any proof against him? - Then leave him alone. - No, no proofs. He only thought about politics, and she about love. The unfortunate truth is that we're sitting on a barrel of dynamite, my dear Capuana. One false move and we all blow. And to be honest: I find it pleasant to live in this town. - And you, my friend? - Same here. But I think there's as much rotten in small towns as there is in big cities. Wherever they transfer me, I know what to expect. Do you have a plan? The killer knows the habits of his victims... so he knows his way around the rich parts of the town. - That's where I have to look for him. - But be careful. I don't want you to venture into even higher circles. No... not here... Please. I'm afraid, darling. I don't like this place. It's dangerous... all alone out here. I'm begging you. But what are you afraid of, my love? You don't think I'm the killer, do you? What are you saying? But why out here in the open? It's not easy to find an apartment. And I don't want to go to your place. If it's about money, don't worry about it. Come on, I'm begging you, let's go. - But Renata... - I'm begging you. - It's you, inspector? - Don't worry... I'm not here in an official capacity, Mr. Gastone. I was passing by your house and thought I might have a chat with Gastone... the right hand of Casali. How long have you been working with the professor? - Two years. Ever since I got here. - Very nice. Very cosy in here. Yes, please have a seat. - You were saying? - I didn't say anything. - Do you like your work? - Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't do it. As you wouldn't do yours if you didn't like it. Well said. And what do you do when you're not working? I rarely go out. I take care of my flowers. A nice place. Very well kept. You live alone? You want to know why I'm not married? No, that's none of my business. It's lovely here. Nice and bright in here. - And what's over there? - The bathroom and the kitchen. I only have two rooms. It's not easy for a man of my profession to find a woman, you know? Sooner or later they find out... about the corpses. And then it's over before it even started. And what is this? It's a small photo lab. Well, this is not a search. I will go now. Do you want to have a look at it? - If you don't mind. - I don't. - I have to tell you something, inspector. - Go on. This might sound absurd... but if you didn't know them, would you think they're dead? Look, how beautiful they are. More beautiful than alive. Death cleansed them. No more traces of sin or human misery. And all thanks to me. That's why I love my work. - You see? Three Minutes. - Agostini would have made it faster. Very funny. Besides, I'm driving slower when I'm with you. - You know what? - You like me. Yes, but I also like school these days. And public gatherings, talks with teachers, protests, collectives... I like collectives too, but only the ones with you. You reactionary. You're a spoiled bourgeois. Not even shocking current events shake you. You mean the maniac? Who cares about him? - He's only after the old timers. - You're right. But that also affects us. My parents don't want me to go out anymore. I have only five minutes for you. You're talking like your father. You're not a good revolutionary. I'll stay as long as you want. But I didn't come here to talk about politics. Yes? What do you want? You're mistaken. This is the residence of the lawyer Santangeli. Why did you hang up? Was that the guy who always dials the wrong number? Who? I don't know what you mean, Paolo. You do know what I mean. Don't try to make me an idiot. You think I don't know your latest mistress, even though she lives next door? - I'm taking the same liberties as you do. - Very well. That was plain enough. But we shouldn't forget something: What? We have a reputation to lose. And with that reputation our wealth, this house and a daughter. Are you speaking for me or for you? For both of us. Your private life doesn't interest me. But I don't want a scandal. It's strange, this killer... He's only after... adulteresses. So what? He might rid you of me. - You would like that, wouldn't you? - No. Not at this price. Please do me a favour: Pay another visit to your mother. Like you do so often these days. But this time, you actually go. You thought about everything, didn't you? In my opinion, this solution is acceptable and elegant. When all this is over, you can come back here without fear. Please do as I tell you, Franca. You're in danger. Everything fine at school? Wonderful flowers, madam. - To the envy of my wife. - Your wife doesn't care about them. How's your husband? He doesn't care about anything, he's not well. I'll see you in the evening. At 6 p.m. The usual place. No, inspector, you're following a wrong path. Gastone is a strange fellow, but harmless. He has this morbid passion... for corpses. He beautifies and photographs them, but that's all. I once knew someone who would smash valuable vases... - just so he could fix them again. - Listen, Capuana. I know you're desperately trying to catch the murderer, who will surely kill again... - but Gastone is not your man. - How can you be so sure? Well, I know him very well. Gastone is not capable of committing any act of violence. That's why he always wants to erase every trace of it. Professor Casali, I started my career in Sicily and Sardinia... where 2 + 2 equals 4. There, every murder has a motive. But what motive is there for these crimes? I don't know. Perhaps it's the work of a homosexual. Yes, out of jealousy. My theory is supported by the fact... that all the lovers' faces have been erased from the photos. - That's right. - Or a betrayed husband. Just think about it: He kills two, three, four unfaithful wives... and then his own wife. Who would suspect him? Or maybe an impotent man. Impotent men often have a mortal hate for women they cannot possess. In this case we'd have a huge problem: How should I find an impotent man? With a newspaper ad? I have to go. I promised my wife to come home for supper. At least this one time. Why don't you come to my place for dinner some time? Together with your wife, of course. - It would be a pleasure. - Mine too. As soon as this is over. It's already late. I must go. Please... It's better that way, my love. - What's that? You frightened me. - You're home so late? You've become unbearable. When you tried to commit suicide because of me, as you claimed... you could at least have done a decent job, and gone to hell... instead of staying here, ruining my life. - Will I see you in the garden afterwards? - Why not? Mother suffers from insomnia but she'll take her pills... and 15 minutes later she's fast asleep. That's it, kids. Your parents don't want you to come home so late. The same old story. Totally exaggerated. I'm sorry. I made a promise to your parents. All because of that fool. - Why doesn't he get laid instead of killing? - He should have group sex. I'll take you home. I'm sorry, it's not my fault. - My best to your mother. - Shall we go? At half past ten in the garden. - Yes or no? And don't think about it. - You know it's yes. Since day one. - Isn't that your neighbour? - Her husband's a cripple... and has to go on crutches. She has a lover... they say. And not the first one. At least she has the good taste not to bring him to her house. Will you walk me to the gate? Where are you? Make sure you get all the details. Get a wide-shot from every angle. And lots of close-ups. The usual photos were left next to the body, of course. - An accident, I'd say. - Agreed. Search all his papers. Always the same technique. Is there any evidence of a struggle? She was taken by surprise, and tried desperately to resist. Just like the others. Three murders in a very short time. The similar techniques point to the same killer. All killings seem to be unmotivated. The work of the police in a case like... Faster, Paolo. You're moving too slow. Move, move. - I'm coming. Can I go? - Go ahead. Gianni, you take over. - Have you been waiting for long? - A couple minutes. - Have you heard? - Read it in the papers. - It's terrible. - I saw it all. - What? - It was so horrible. I was about to go back into the house. He was standing by the pool. I saw him stabbing her. It was a man wearing a mask. But... you saw him kill her? Yes. I was paralysed. I was frightened stiff. But did you see the killer? Did you recognise him? It was too dark. And he wore a stocking over his head. You think he saw you too? - He turned around to me. - Come on, let's go. - We should tell your dad about this. - I'll talk to him. I told him I'd go study at Paola's. - Would you come with me? - Of course. - You want me to collect you later? - No, my house is not far from here. - Which floor? - Top floor. You're going away? What's wrong? Grandma called. She suffered a relapse. Again? When will you be back? I don't know, Bettina. Depends on her state. I'll call you as soon as I arrive to let you know. - Last time you stayed for a week. - Yes, let's hope for the best. I have to go now, or I'll miss my train. - I'm taking the sleeping car. - And daddy? Does he know you're leaving? Naturally. He was busy with a client. But he promised to come to the station to say goodbye. Do you have anything to tell me? Have a good trip. - Send Grandma my love. - Of course. Goodbye. DEAD WOMAN IN THE SLEEPING CAR. THE MANIAC HAS KILLED AGAIN. CITY IN FEAR. PANIC SPREADS: EVERYBODY SEES THE KILLER. POLICE RECEIVES NUMEROUS CALLS. A STORM OF ANONYMOUS LETTERS. WILL THE KILLER STRIKE AGAIN? I preferred to come here on my own free will. My daughter is still in shock. Unfortunately, she heard it on the radio that her mother was killed. Just like the others. I understand. I'm at your disposal. What do you want to know? You're a lawyer. You know that I have to ask you some unpleasant questions. Naturally, inspector. Please treat me like everybody else. There'll be fewer misunderstandings if we're frank. Your first question might be: "Mr. Santangeli, did you get on that train?" Indeed, that's it. I didn't get on. I just saw her at the very last moment. Franca was standing by the window. I barely managed to reach for her hand... and to wish her a good trip. Did you see anybody you know at the station? But who could tell? If someone doesn't intend to find an alibi, he won't pay attention. Besides, I don't have a motive. There's no life insurance, no inheritance... And I don't even use a razor to shave. But you did forget an important motive: The revenge of a betrayed husband. You're an old man, my dear inspector. We live in different times now. Franca cheated on me, and I knew about it. And my wife knew that I'm unfaithful, too. We live in a time where married couples... are looking for other couples with newspaper ads... to swap wives. - Do you find that cynical? - Where were you after your wife departed? After the departure of the train? Please treat me like everybody else. Don't beat about the bush. Why don't you ask me: "Where were you when your wife was murdered?" Alright. Then I'll ask what you wanted to be asked: "Where were you when your wife was murdered?" You should ask that your commissioner. I was killing him at the hunt club... in a bridge tournament, of course. I guess we're done with the interview, aren't we? That's right. You can go. You want me to say it again? I didn't call him in. He came on his own accord. I want to be frank with you, Capuana. We've known each other for a long time. That's why I don't blame you. But get into your head that the fuse is burning. - This could blow us to pieces. - Damn it. - The lawyer wasn't at the club. - I know what I'm doing. I can't explain my motives to you. You better go and find out who his new mistress is. And don't cause me any more problems. You want me to leave so you can pass the case on to someone else? Don't be ridiculous. You can't give up now. I know it's a dirty story. You're the chief of the criminal investigation division... and you have my utmost trust. Whenever I think I found the answer... there's still something missing. Don't lose heart, and continue your investigation. This damn maniac must make a mistake some day. Perhaps. But he hasn't made the slightest mistake yet. Without a doubt, he's very intelligent. He appointed himself the moral avenger of the upper class. He knows all their secrets... all their lovers, and where they meet. He must be one of them. That's all we know. That's not enough, Capuana. We have to act faster. We have to catch him quick if we don't want to get fried. Giannina, you're not happy. But you think you are. In fact, you're afraid. - Afraid of a man who's threatening you. - What man? Your husband, Giannina. For your own good: Don't drive him too far. Stop it, mother. Your husband, Renata, he trusted you. But now he's in doubt. He's gone away, or pretends he is. In any case, you're alone tonight, and without protection. Stay here, my dear. Don't go home. You live too isolated. Mother, your cards are getting on my nerves. I see it perfectly clear. Renata loves the danger, just like me. After all, it's the danger that gives an adventure its flavour. - Is he gone? - Yes, he left yesterday. Aren't you in the mood for a little night stroll? Why don't you come over? I already told you I can't relax there. Someone might see us. But who could possibly see you? And if' your husband Walks in all 0f a sudden? No, he's not the type for surprises. I'm expecting you, dear. Come on over. I'm dying to make love to you. - Come on, don't keep me in suspense. - I want you too. See you soon. Renata, it's me. Open the door. You're leaving so early? I just came home. You've been up all night? I understand. Another murder... Who is it this time? Here, read it. Renata too. It's horrible. Now there are five. Did you read this? They're attacking the police. I read it. And others will follow. Next they'll claim we're on the side of the opposition. Why are they making a political affair out of this? Because two of the husbands are in politics. And the scandal hurts them. Why won't you give all this up, darling? My father offered you a good position in his firm. Let them go to hell. - Why don't you accept his offer? - You know that's not for me. I'm a policeman. What would I do among refrigerators? When I was transferred here some years ago, I thought I had found some peace. Remember? A lovely town. Surrounded by green. A low crime rate. Only a few small-time crooks. And then suddenly, within two months: The apocalypse. Hello? Capuana speaking. What? And the address, sergeant? - I'll come right away. - What happened? The maniac called us. Maybe we've got him. Open up. In the name of the law. - Don't shoot. I'm unarmed. - Inside. Why did you call us? Why? I'm tired of killing. You see? This is my work. All these whores. What know why I did it? In the presence of a magistrate, at the station. But of course. I'm the man you were looking for. Tell me the truth: I gave you a hard fight. If I hadn't turned myself in, you would have never caught me. I have a diabolic mind. Do you know how I chose my victims? - Take him away. - Don't give yourself credit. You never would have found me on your own. He's a publicity seeker. Maybe it appears so. But I set the whole thing up. And I hope it works out. I chose someone who is the exact opposite of the killer. Hoping the real one will fall for it. Isn't that right? Right. If we credit the murders to a half-wit... the killer feels insulted, and will come out of his hiding. Yes, this is an interesting experiment. - But the magistrate...? - It will take him a few days... to discover that he can only charge the man with misrepresentation. Meanwhile I hope that the culprit gives himself away. Alright, Capuana. I hope so too. I just want you to be very careful. - Because of the killer? - No, because of the press. They're waiting downstairs for the usual press conference. Good luck in the lion's den. But this time it'll be different. - Where is the monster now? - With the magistrate. What's his name? It's all on the photos we gave you. - What did he say when he was arrested? - That he's tired of killing. The he boasted with his diabolical mind. Are you sure he's the culprit? This is what we found in his house: A pair of gloves... a hat, a knife and a black mask. You have any other proof? Of course we also recapitulated his life during the last few months. But the preliminary arrest can only be prolonged for two days. I want to make one thing clear: This was not an arrest... and no arrest warrant has been issued. - Meaning what? - As of now, he's only a witness. He turned himself in. What's your opinion? I'm not the magistrate. He has to make the decisions. That would be all, gentlemen. Be seeing you soon. There's something odd about this. THE MANIAC WAS CAPTURED. THE POLICE STORMS A HOUSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS. FINDS A KNIFE, GLOVES AND THE KILLER'S MASK. THE MAN CONFESSED. / I am the man you think you have captured. - Who? - Don't be any stupider than you are. - Excuse me, I don't understand. - Really? - Who are you? - You understand very well. I'm sorry, but... I can't give you my name. I'm the one you call the "maniac"... instead of the "moral avenger". The man you arrested is just a pathetic moron. If you know that and conceal it, you're a fraud. If you don't know that, you're even stupider than him. In any case, you're totally incapable. Why should I believe you? The fact that you're calling me proves that you're the idiot. You're the one who's irrational, inspector. All you found in this imbecile's house are some pornographic photos... and some clippings from sex magazines. I will make you look like a fool. You made a big mistake, Capuana. And now you'll pay for it, very dearly. What mistake? - You don't understand. - Enlighten me. - Stop joking around. - You got two minutes. - You underestimated me. That was a mistake. While you're playing with that poor fool, I will kill again. I will strike again to make a fool out of you, the commissioner and the magistrate. That'll be the end of your career. But don't hang up. I have to tell you something important: I will kill your wife, this very day. Now you're speechless. You don't believe me? Yes, I will kill your wife. You got that right: Your own wife. Listen, stop wasting my time. The maniac only kills unfaithful women, whores. Exactly, whores. You must be the only one in town who doesn't know your wife deceives you. Wave photos to prove 'k. Just like the others. You didn't expect this? You'll be disgraced. You'll have to leave town, a cuckold and a widower. And you can't prevent it, Capuana, because you have no idea where they meet. Now you're not laughing anymore? - Yes, inspector? - I don't wish to speak to anybody. - To nobody. understand? - Yes, inspector. You found in this imbecile's house are some pornographic photos... and some clippings from sex magazines. I will make you look like an ass. You made a big mistake, Capuana. You must be the only one in town who doesn't know your wife deceives you. I have photos to prove it. Just like the others. You didn't expect this? You'll be disgraced. - The Capuana residence. Who? there? - It's me, Teresa. ls my wife home? She went out. She wanted to go to the hairdresser. - ls there something else I can do for you? You'll have to leave town, a cuckold and a widower. And you can't prevent it, Capuana, because you have no idea where they meet. Now you're not laughing anymore? clippings from sex magazines. I will make you look like a fool. You made a big mistake, Capuana. And now you'll pay for it, very dearly. It's Capuana. ls my wife there? - No, inspector. - But she wanted to come? - Yes, but she hasn't arrived yet. - But she has an appointment? Yes, she does. You want me to check the time? I'm sure she'll be here in time. - Tell her to call me. No problem. She'll call you once she's here. Yes, like this... that's very sensual. - When is Signora Capuana expected to arrive? - At 5 p.m. But she's always late. I'm sure she won't be here before 7 p.m. She comes to get her hair done... "afterwards". - Madam, I have magic hands, don't I? - That's true. You should see me with the boys... who doesn't know your wife deceives you. I have photos to prove it. Just like the others. You didn't expect this? You'll be disgraced. You'll have to leave town, a cuckold and a widower. And you can't prevent it, Capuana, because you have no idea where they meet. Now you're not laughing anymore? You'll be disgraced. You'll have to leave town... a cuckold and a widower. And you can't prevent it, Capuana, because you have no idea where they meet. Now you're not laughing anymore? You'll be disgraced. You'll have to leave town... a cuckold and a widower. And you can't prevent it, Capuana, because you have no idea where they meet. Now you're not laughing anymore? DEADLY LOVE STORY. HIM AND HER ON THE RUN. THE FASCINATING BLONDE FOREIGNER HAS AN ITALIAN PASSPORT. HUSBAND NOTIFIED. THE LOVER WAS A YOUNG FRENCH INDUSTRIALIST.

Alone? - Hello uncle. - Roberto is taking me... - if you don't mind. - Of course not. Providing he's not racing, as usual. Don't worry. When he's with me, he doesn't race. Well then... see you later. - Who's there? - Her husband knows everything. Get out of there, don't be a fool. Her husband knows everything... But who are you? Hold it, Casali. Perhaps we're dealing with a sex maniac. And then the mortal cut. Capuana here. Give me the commissioner.
