Well, they said a lot of stuff. The thing that really jumped out was "three years in prison." Three years? Yeah, yöu haven't paid taxes since '94, Donny. What. . . I thought they were taking it out automatically! I told them that's what yöu thought, and they said it's the stupidest thing they ever heard. But there is some good news. If yöu can pay the balance off by the end of the weekend, they'll suspend the sentence. Oh, okay, there yöu go. What are we talking about? Hit me. 43,000. 43 grand? No! Come on, Donny!

No. This is Tubby Tuke, fat guy. Fat guy? Gonna run the marathon. Odds on him winning are 8,000-to-1 . But this cat's got wheels on him. I think he's gonna win, I really do. All right, I'll put 20 on the fat fuck, but I can't count on that. It's a long shot, yöu said it yöurself. But what about yöur kid? Maybe he can come up with the dough. We don't talk no more. He kind of moved out when he turned 18, and, uh, that's the last I seen of him. What happened? I don't know. I loved that little Han Solo more than anything in the world, too. Yöu named yöur kid Han Solo? Yes, sir. Han Solo Berger? Coolest name in the world, right? Why don't yöu just Facebook him? I can't afford that shit. What am I, a billionaire? I don't think he wants to be found, anyways. Especially by me. Hey, look! It's us! (SHRIEKING) On the cover! Don't we look great? Yeah, well, yöu look good. I kind of look like a ventriloquist.

(SIGHS SOFTLY) DONNY: HoIy shit. What the hell happened to my Iife, ChampaIe? Don, honey, no way to come up with that money, huh? No. The only thing I'm good at is being Donny Berger, and no one wants to pay for that anymore. Aw, Donny. Wow! My face is yöur toilet! Show some fucking respect over there, Kenny. Hey, whoa. Hey, Mom, did yöu want some breakfast after yöu finish yöur dance? Give it to me now, honey. Donny doesn't mind, do yöu, Donny? Holy cow, that's my son ! Who, Han Solo? I thought yöu said he was a fatty. No, no, no. He must have lost the weight or something, 'cause I swear to God, that's my boy. It says, "Todd Peterson to wed Jamie Martin this Sunday "at All Saints Church on Cape Cod." Todd Peterson? He changed his name! Why? What was wrong with Han Solo Berger? It's the coolest fucking name of all time. "Peterson is one of the yöungest "large-cap hedge fund managers in the financial industry." Oh, he got rich on us, huh? "All the more impressive considering he was orphaned "at age nine when both his parents "died in a horrific explosion." He fucking blew me up and his mother? Donny, maybe yöur son could help yöu, financially. I don't know. This kid changed his name. He doesn't even want to be a Berger anymore. He's not gonna want to talk to me.

Look at yöu, the lovely bride. What a couple! Mr. Spirou, it's so amazing that yöu're letting us all stay here. Seriously, thank yöu so much. Steve, these are my parents, Gerald and Helen. Oh, it's a pleasure. Hi. Yöur daughter's a sweetheart. Yöu can tell she likes Todd for Todd, not because he's gonna be rich. I wouldn't want my boy to end up with some gold digger like the last three whores I married, huh? (LAUGHTER) True story. All three? Whores. (CHUCKLES) Huh. Well, guys, this weekend, mi casa es su casa. Yöu know, every member of my staff are lucky to be in this country, so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em. (LAUGHS) Go get the fucking bags! Well, Mrs. Spirou, I've always said that if the finance game was an amusement park, yöur son would be a roller coaster, and I would just ride him all day long. (CHUCKLES) That came out weird. Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think that he's the star of the family. But before he was born, I modeled a bathing suit for a Woolworth advertisement. Well, yöu still have quite a figure on yöu there, Delores. Yeah, I can see where Steve got his rocking bod. (LAUGHS) Oh, why, thank yöu. JAMIE: Oh ! Chad's here! Oh, my God. Oh, hooray.

No. Airman? No. Girl Scout? No. Well, then I'd prefer if yöu take yöur fingers away from yöur forehead and yöu shake my hand like the civilian yöu are. Yeah, sorry, I'm stupid. I don't know why I did that. Honest mistake. Come here, I want to show yöu this. (CHUCKLING) Look, if yöu ever do anything to hurt my sister, I will take my government-issued service revolver, stick it straight up yöur fuppin' poop chute, and empty the clip. Do yöu feel me? Yes, I totally feel yöu. . . Dawg. (CHUCKLES) Randy Jackson, right? I've got 10 ways to kill yöu with my bare hands right now. (CHUCKLES) Don't. (CHUCKLES) Don't. Hi, sweetheart, how are yöu? Can I see Randall Morgan possibly? Yeah, yöu're gonna need an appointment. I knew yöu were gonna say that. Uh, but yöu know what? Tell him Donny Berger's out here. He'll be pretty psyched to see an old friend. Yöu know what? Mr. Morgan's on vacation right now. I'm sorry. He's on vacation? That son of a. . . Oh, hey! Vanilla Ice. Randall's just getting makeup. Go ahead to the green room. Vanilla, what's up, guy? It's been a long time. Uh, how yöu been? Are yöu seriously giving me the silent treatment still? Yöu know that hurts me. Yeah? Well, that's why I'm giving it to yöu. How's it feel, chump? It's breaking my heart. We were friends for 20 years, guy. We were friends until yöu banged my mother! I didn't know it was her, I swear to God ! It's not like her last name is Ice. Yöu should've known by the haircut! Aw, come on, Vanilla Bean Latte. Will yöu just. . . What? I'm just saying, I'm in big trouble, guy. This, like, monetary thing. I, uh. . . I'm going to prison if I don't get 43 large, so. . . What, do yöu think I got that kind of money? Of course yöu got that kind of money. Royalties from Ice Ice Baby, yöu must be fucking loaded ! Man, listen, Queen took 50%. Suge took the other 60%. I fucking owe money when that shit gets played, man ! Dude, come on, will yöu please stop, collaborate and listen? Oh, here. . . What? No, I love that song. Yöu know that shit. I was on top of that, fucking day one. Listen, man. I work at a ice rink now. I deep-fry chicken nuggets, man. I'll get yöu a deal on a barbecue sauce packet. Fucking A, buddy. Both of us. This sucks. Broke. Who'd have thought this would happen to us? Maybe I should call yöur mother. She'll give me the money, I know that. What? What? What? What? (PEOPLE GASP) (GROANING) Hey, dude. Didn't spill my beer, fucker. (LAUGHS) Fuck yöu. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody comes in here and starts busting up my joint unless I got cameras rolling. Look, Donny, nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did, let alone something that happened 25 years ago. Oh, I'm telling yöu, when I walk down the street, people are like, "There's that guy!" I'm still fucking big, dude. All right, how about this? I'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks. Maybe I slip yöu in after that Milli Vanilli guy, all right? Who, Fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine. Yeah. That would be huge, dude. How much money? Um. . . Maybe 400 bucks. 400 bucks? Dude, I need 43 G-birds. What are we talking about right now? RANDALL: (LAUGHING) Yöu need $43,000? Are yöu back on drugs? Yeah. It's never. . . This is never going to happen. Never. Little bit more blush if yöu can. Just like yöu did that, uh, John Wayne Bobbitt in his penis reunion show. That's actually a good idea, a reunion. Me and Miss McGarricle, together again, live from a women's prison. A women's prison. Very sexy. Mmm..hmm. We could shoot it this weekend. Yöu could give me the money. Very sexy. Yöu know, yöu could eat that ass after I leave the room, but I need an answer right now. What do yöu think? What about yöur kid? My kid? What about my kid? He. . . He's got to be a walking Gong Show. No. What are yöu talking about? He's doing great. He's, like, a hot shit now. He's getting married down at the Cape this weekend. Wait, wait, wait, wait. "Horny teacher baby makes good." (SNIFFS) Smell that? Smell it, Donny? What? That's not me. She probably cut the cheese. No, no, no. No, ratings. (SNIFFS) I smell ratings. My kid is very publicity-shy, so I. . . Yöu know, to be honest, I don't think he'd do a piece of shit show like this. All right, here's the deal. Yöu get yöurself and yöur actual kid up to the women's prison this weekend, I will shoot it, I will give yöu 50 grand in cash. 'Cause I'm going to guess, Donny, yöu want to be visiting a prison, not living in one. So, Todd, how does one get into the hedgehog business anyway? Oh, it's actually hedge funds. Yöu think yöu're better than me? No. JAMIE: Chad, did yöu know that Todd is really great with numbers? Yöu got to see this. Oh, Jamie, no. Don't make. . . What's 452 times 77? Beep boop beep. 84,304. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, he could just be making that up. No, he's not! Ooh. There's a calculator on my cell phone. Okay. What is 94. . . times 312, Todd? Beep boop boop boop beep. 29,328, Helen. Freaky. I don't know. It's just something I can do. Are yöu sure yöu're not a Chinaman? TODD: Oh, that's inappropriate. White whore. (CHUCKLES) (DOORBELL RINGING) JAMIE: Oh, I'll get it. Oh, my God. Yöu must be Jamie. Yöu're, like, even hotter than yöu looked in the paper. (LAUGHS) Look at yöur hair blowing in the wind like Tawny Kitaen when she was fucking dry-humping that car. Okay. And yöu must be. . . Donny. What's the matter? Chubby never even mentioned me? Chubby? Oh, I mean. . . (MOCKING) Todd Peterson. Why do yöu say it like that? It just comes out that way. Where are my manners, right? Could yöu hold that? Take a chug if yöu'd like. I got yöu a fucking great gift. Here it is. I'll take the brew back. Just, yöu got to read it, though. It's fucking. . . Yeah ! (LAUGHS) I don't know where they come up with this shit, but it's pretty fucking funny. Spencer's Gifts never fucking fails me. I want to meet Mr. Spencer one day and say, "Thanks, motherfucker, for all the laughs." Hey, I also made yöu a mix tape. Who the fuck is rich in this house? Jeezum, it's huge. Uh, Todd, yöur old man is here? Wassup! Oh ! (GASPS) Helen, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. No, it's. . . Uh, let me just get that for yöu. Uh, uh, that's, uh. . . What? No. Oh, sorry, those are yöurs. I. . . Donny, what. . . what the fuck, man? Sorry. Uh, what. . . what are yöu doing here? What do yöu mean? I thought yöu said yöur parents were dead. Um, no, they are. . . super dead. He's hilarious. (LAUGHS) My old man. My old man. . . friend. From. . . Wassup! Right? Well, aren't yöu going to introduce us? No. Yes. Yes. Here we go. Uh, this is, uh, my future father-in-law, Gerald, and his lovely wife, Helen. And Jamie's brother, Chad. Hey..o! Do not. . . That's. . . (LAUGHTER) What? I like the look of this. Who's this? Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother, Delores, who's awake now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where yöu get all the looks from, huh, sweetie? Yeah, no, we're not related. Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes, 'cause yöu got the fucking. . . yöu're stacked pretty good. Mmm. Anyhow, Jame, this is my old friend, Donny. Yöur best friend. I'm his best friend. Mmm. Yöur best friend. Uh, yeah, no. Remember I told yöu we met, uh. . . Where'd we meet? Um, we met. . . Where? Come on. Uh, it's coming to me. I saved his life. Oh. Well, more metaphorically. No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened. It was, like, one of them, uh, train track kind of deals. My man over here, I see him, he drops his burrito on the tracks. I'm like, "All right, that happens." Next thing yöu know, homeboy leaps down there, and he tries to retrieve the burrito. Okay? I see a train whizzing at him. I'm like, "This guy's about to die, and he don't know it." I fucking leap down there myself, right, and I give him a little shove on the heinie. "Get out of the way, buddy!" Next thing yöu know, I realize this thing's going to hit me. I fucking remember, though, I had a kung fu instructor who taught me how to tighten the diaphragm, and I bring it in there. And I feel the train go by. My eyes are closed. Rips my shirt off my body, okay? I open my eyes. I see all these chicks just kind of looking at me, going, "What is that? "That's the fucking most chiseled guy I've ever seen." I worked out at the time. Anyways, the place goes bananas for me, I sign a couple of titties, and I started hanging out with this guy ever since. Best friends, right? Here yöu go, my boy. I just can't believe I've never heard that story before. Why wouldn't yöu just get another burrito, Todd? Uh, wouldn't it be dirty? Great questions. Uh, it's one of the many things about this story that's pretty hard to believe. So, uh, where are yöu staying, Donny? Oh, he's not staying. No. I can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right. Oh, pshaw. I mean, invite him to stay here. Yöu have to stay. He's yöur best friend. Yöu're his best friend. Sheesh, I'm not messing with her. I mean, yöu are my best friend, guy. And, Jamie, yöu can be my breast friend. (LAUGHTER) Oh. Breast, with an "R." With an "R." Oh ! Ooh ! By the way, dude, yöu look fantastic. Yöu lost all the weight, homeboy. I miss the titties. Yöu saved my life? Seriously? What? They ate that up. Yöu came up with a whole lot of nothing. That's a nice suitcase, by the way. What is that, Louis Vuitton? This is a Hefty bag. What the fuck are yöu talking about? What do yöu want, Donny? Money? Yöu heard I was doing well, so yöu came looking for a handout? I don't want none of yöur money. How is that? Okay? I get it. Yöu don't like me. I exploded. I wish yöu had exploded. That way, I wouldn't have to see yöur stupid face anymore! Did yöu happen to notice I created a whole fake life just so I could get away from yöu? Yöur mother's sick, by the way. (SIGHS) I don't believe yöu. They don't know how long she's got. What is that, nunchuks? I told her yöu would visit her up at the prison. I'm kind of thinking yöu're the kind of guy who would pull through for Mumsie. Know what I'm saying? She'd do the same for yöu. Really? Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day before the big surgery, so. . . So let me get this straight. Yöu want me to go visit my "sick mom" that I haven't talked to in years, in prison, the day before my wedding. Correct. Not happening, asshole. What the fuck did I do to yöu to make yöu hate me so much? I am fucking baffled right now. Well, maybe yöu don't remember, but yöu were basically the worst parent ever. Me? I did everything for yöu, buddy, and I never gave yöu an ounce of shit about nothing. Yöu never gave me nothing. I gave yöu a snake. Yeah, and then it died after it ate all yöur Quaaludes. That was the only time anybody's ever seen a king cobra laugh. And I take pride in that, so fuck yöu. Yeah, great. Yöu know what? I basically had to raise myself, Donny. I never learned how to swim. I don't even know how to ride a bike. Yöu know how fucking humiliating that is? What about Mr. Mitty? Remember him? What? No. What's that? Mr. Mitty. I used to put an oven mitt on my hand. He would cheer yöu up all the time when yöu were sad. "Don't be upset, yöung man. "I'm yöur best friend. "Even though I'm an oven mitt." No, I don't remember that, okay? Yöu know what I do remember? Yöu making me drive yöu home from the beach 'cause yöu got too drunk. It makes sense to me. When somebody's hammered, they have another guy drive home. I was eight! Well, yöu looked 14 'cause yöu were such a huge fat fuck. I'm sorry. Oh, yöu are such an asshole. Dude, yöu're a millionaire now, and yöu're marrying that hot chick. I must have done a pretty decent job as a dad, don't yöu think? Oh, yeah? Yöu want to check in on yöur pretty decent job? DONNY: Oh, my God. Yöu're a junkie? Who's yöur supplier? 'Cause I'll smack that motherfucker around. It's insulin, yöu dick. I'm a diabetic 'cause yöu let me eat cake and lollipops for breakfast every day. But that's what yöu fucking asked for. Yeah, yöu're supposed to say no. Yöu know, I weighed 400 pounds by the time I was 12. Yöu know how hard it was to take that weight off? All right, all right. I. . . I didn't know what I was doing. I had no one helping me. Grandpa was a psycho. Yöu know that. Han Solo, don't be like this. I'm a good person. Okay, don't call me that, all right? My name's Todd now. Call yöurself Han Solo. Yöu're dressed like him. Good one. I'm just saying, buddy, give me a chance. Do yöu have any Axe body spray? No, Donny, I don't have any Axe body spray. Because I'm not a fucking douche bag. That's a douche bag thing? When did that become a douche bag thing? (KNOCK AT DOOR) JAMIE: Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go! All right, can yöu lighten up a little bit? We got a party to attend. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Good person, how about yöu put on a tie, okay? It's a cocktail party, not a Quiznos opening. What? I haven't worn a tie since my mother's funeral when I was three. I'm not going to start that up again. That's great. Put on a tie. No. Put on a tie! I'll never sell out. I'll give yöu 100 bucks. Where's the tie? (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Look at this. Jamie is going to have it all. (SIGHS) TODD: Oh, by the way, Mr. Spirou, I read the OPEC report, and I was thinking, if we hedge our position on oil, we could really, um. . . (TODD SIGHS) Uh, if we were to short the euro, we could. . . Oh, come on, Todd. This is yöur wedding weekend. Yöu are marrying a real workaholic. Yöu do know that. Yeah, but isn't that what yöu want in a partner? Oh, she's good, this one. (LAUGHING) Oh, she's good. All right, all right. Uh, I haven't made that decision yet, but I love this kid. Yöu lost yöur dad in that explosion, and. . . and I lost my son. I thought yöur son was a ski instructor in Vail. He's a pot-smoking bum ! Not like yöu, Todd. Oh, no. Yöu're the type of boy a father can be proud of. Yeah, we'll never know, will we? Who's that? Oh, I'm not here. That's, uh, Donny. Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone. Oh, God, hang on. Let me swing these free. Glad all the children saw that. JAMIE: Uh, Donny, this is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss. Wassup! Is that back? Because I've been dying for that to come back. Wassup! Yeah ! That's my boy! Look at him ! He ain't a tight-ass. Wassup! (LAUGHING) Wassup! Wassup! Wassup! (LAUGHING) What's up? Boo! That was terrible, Todd. So, I see the. . . the train coming, and something kind of like takes over me, yöu know? Here yöu go, Abigail. Thank yöu. And so, I decide to jump off the platform, right? Snaps my legs in two.

Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers, but let's get back to love. What's the matter, hot stuff? Where do yöu think yöu get it from? Yöur mother was a math teacher, and I was pretty much a whiz kid myself. The ability to make a bong out of a Taco Bell cup doesn't make yöu a whiz kid, Donny. Leap year, motherfucker.

Yeah, I've been there. We've all been there. She said it was her last time, so. . . Oh. Maybe things will work out. Then how come I feel like shit right now? Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket. But the good news is, yöu stay out of the slammer, right, Donny? Donny? "Go do something." I don't know, Mr. Mitty. I don't know if I can fucking handle it. "Be a good person." JIM OVER PHONE: Donny? Oh, no, no, don't hit me. No, no. Just give me a moment, please, Todd. Just a moment. Relax. Yöu know, after praying with the monsignor, I realize that I committed the sin of prideful anger in the church, and I hope that yöu'll accept my apology and allow me the honor of being a part of this joyöus day. Oh, well, what about Father Shakalu? Oh, stupid bird. Come on, fly! Oh, well, uh, he's cool. Great. Sounds good. Oh, oh. . . By the way, Todd, uh, was it yöu that hit me in the head with the bottle?
