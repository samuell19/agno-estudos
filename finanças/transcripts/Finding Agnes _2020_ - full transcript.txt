Ma'am? The car is ready for you. Okay, please bring my things downstairs. Yes, ma'am. What are you doing? I'm coloring it in. -Would you like to try it? -Sure. Ma, look, I'm close to solving it. Son, I really need to go now. Ma, I don't like that name. It's Brix. Where are you going? Ma, why are you messing it up? I almost got it! Brix, my child… I will come right back once you've solved this. Okay, Ma. Get in the car. Be quick. Hurry. -Wait, Mama! I'm coming with you! -Brix! -Mama, I'm coming with you! -Brix! Sir, Rivero Realty will present their marketing plan for next year at 1:00 p.m. Brix's Chicken House would like to tackle a food security issue at 4:00 p.m. But sir, we've been rescheduling them over and over. Dante, drink your vitamins. But sir… Mrs. Rivero, please have a seat. What do you need, Ma? Nothing. I just wanted to see you. You're still drinking your favorite. I'm surprised you remember, Ma. Of course. Isn't that what you always order-- What about this, Mom? Do you still remember this? Ma, why didn't you come back for me? Virgilio, my son… I don't know where to begin explaining to you. I never stopped wanting to see you. To hold you. You don't know how much I wanted to be with you. But I thought I was doing the right thing, to leave you behind, because I believed it was the best for you. I know I've been gone for more than 25 years. Forgive me. I'd hoped by now, you would have forgiven me. I love you very much. It's okay, Ma. Don't cry. I'm sorry, son. But I'm here now. We can start over. Excuse me, Ma. I just need to take this call. Yes, Francis. What's the update? I'm here in Singapore with our board members. We ran into a problem with our Singaporean partners. That's why I'm flying to Singapore to deal with that. The report clearly shows the company is earning well. That's why they should quit their whining. You should have told them that. Update me again, all right? That's all. Ma'am, Mr. Rivero insists that you let his chauffeur drive you home. All right. Young lady, can I ask you a favor? I didn't get to ask my son this earlier. Kindly ask if he received the letters I sent from Morocco. I really need to know. This is my cell phone number. The chauffeur's ready for you now, ma'am. What? Is that so? Just name the place. I'm sorry about earlier, Ma. It was a bad time. Oh, not at all. It's my fault. I apologize. I just barged in without a word. Does Auntie Gloria know that you're here? Maybe not. Your stepmother and I don't really talk to each other. Just that once when your father died. Was Dad aware that you were in Morocco back then? He was. All my letters have return addresses in Morocco. What were you doing in Morocco, Ma? I run a bed and breakfast there, son. I want you to meet Cathy. Who's this Cathy? I have so much to tell you when you get back from your trip. I owe you a great deal. All right, Ma. It's late. Okay, bye. I think it's only 1,500 per square meter. The highway too. They'll be drilling along the fields. Yes, it has great potential, man. Let's talk about it. And make a dinner reservation for me and Mama. Book Nobu. What's your problem? Are you sure it's my mother? Yes, sir. It was Ma'am Gloria who called. Violet. Sir Brix, I've already sent up Ma'am Agnes' things from the hotel. AUNTIE GLORIA Hello, Auntie Glo? I didn't get to see Agnes. I meant to return her letters. It's okay, Auntie. I'll pick them up tomorrow. Sir, who is Cathy Duvera? Sir, who is-- You ask too many questions, Violet. Auntie. I should have given you these a long time ago. I had to take care of a lot of things after your dad died. These are the only ones I got to keep. Your dad had the rest of the letters thrown out. We would receive one each month. Actually, even after you left, the letters kept coming. And you never gave them to me. It's what your dad wanted. He said Agnes was crazy. That's what he would always say. Auntie. I'll be doing some renovations. Maybe there's something you want to bring home from your old room? I remember when Mom was painting that. I'm turning this into an office. …I'm going to have it painted over. It's okay, Auntie. I'll take this. You've got to be kidding. She really likes using that name. She hadn't changed a bit. You must have a girlfriend now. With your good looks, I'm sure you have girls chasing after you. Tell me about you, son. That's Sylvia. Her baby's so cute, don't you think? I'm doing well now, son. I'm not lonely anymore. We're getting a lot of guests here at Brines' Bed and Breakfast. I think Sylvia's daughter is our lucky charm. I hope you can meet them someday. I'm here in Paris right now, son. It's Cathy's graduation. I thought I'd celebrate my birthday here too. The scarf I'm wearing was a gift from Cathy. Isn't it pretty? Cathy will be managing Brines' once we get back. I'm so glad she agreed to do it. I still haven't heard from you, son. ARRIVALS Assalamu alaikum, Mr. Rivero. Why are you still up? Just passing by. So you can speak Tagalog. I don't get to use it much unless I'm talking to someone who speaks it. Folks here go to bed early. So, are you Ma's daughter? Yes. I see. It was her and Mama Agnes who built this B&amp;B. You must know Ma so well. I just wonder about something. She disappeared for 25 years. Weird, right? I guess that was her wake-up call. But the doctor advised her against traveling. What about you, Mr. Rivero? What do you plan to do? My plans? I just want to do what she told me to. To get it over with. And I can go back to the Philippines. But within that time frame, maybe we can arrange a ceremony for her. So you can sit down with the lawyer. I hope it doesn't take time. Mama was so beautiful, wasn't she? Is she really my mother? She's too good-looking. This is the figurine mentioned in the will. Do you know the Castor Family? Auntie Regina. Mom wants us to return this to Regina. I wonder why. Do you have any ideas? But for now, I'll finish packing the boxes for donation. Cathy, someone's coming in tomorrow. Who can show them around? Yes. I've spoken with the lawyer here. Make sure to take care of the money transfer to pay for the state taxes here. I will see some family members, and I'll be back before nightfall. Let's keep in touch then, okay? Okay, let's keep in touch. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Is that our ride? -Let's go. -Okay. -It's all right, -I know coming here wasn't easy. I don't mind. I just hope we get there early. What time is it? We have plenty of time, but maybe we should put a little allowance. Is it still far? -Assalamu alaikum. -Wa alaykumu s-salam. Auntie Regina. It's me. It's been so long since we last saw each other! It really has been. Mama Agnes' son. Hi, Auntie. Are you Virgilio? Yes, Auntie, you can call me Brix. Don't tell me you have brought me something. Yes, Auntie. That figurine… Your mother took it from this riad when we were still just settling in Morocco. She loved looking at it. She remembers you when she does, she said. One day, she came to tell me that when the time comes that you will come looking for me to return that figurine, it means… she's gone. I didn't believe it would actually happen. My cousin loved telling stories about you. And she promised me… that one day, you would be reunited. Yes, Auntie. She came home to the Philippines. We saw each other. Too bad she had a heart attack. The old questions I always had, I never got to ask her. Why Morocco, Auntie? Your mother came with us to get away from your dad. It broke her heart, but she had to do it. She never told us the real reason, but she couldn't tell your father where she was because she was afraid something would happen to her. After a year, she suddenly got up and left. She told me she wanted to find herself. By the way, she told me to give you something. She did? Cathy, you two wait over there. I'll just go and get it. All right, Auntie. Thank you. -This is Mama Agnes' favorite. -Is it? She used to buy this every day. Sometimes it's all she ever eats. This is what she wanted me to give you. THE GALLERY ARTS OF MOROCCO TREES BY AGNES RIVERO She wanted me to have this? This is an old ticket. I don't know, Brix. -What am I supposed to do with this? -Beats me. When your mother left, we never saw or spoke with each other again. When she visited one time, she had Cathy stringing along. This is just in the medina. Would you like to go? That's a great idea. You might find some answers there. Make the most of Morocco, Brix. On your mother's first Christmas here, do you know how she spent it? She drank. Drank herself mad. I'll go back for it. You go in and ask about the ticket. Okay? Will you catch up? There's a painting I want to buy. You bought it? Isn't that weird? I didn't know that Mama was a famous artist here. Wait, what happened to you? Why didn't you catch up? Let's just say I'm avoiding galleries. Did Mama know about it? I think she does. When was this? So that's why. That's why I stay away from all that drama. Look at you. You have great potential, right? But because of your love trauma… And there are so many better things out there that you could be focusing your energy on. What do you mean "better things out there" that I could be focusing my energy on? I just thought that was going to be my happy ending. We can't keep using youth or inexperience as an excuse. You know, when I was that age, I ran away from home. I immediately got into business. My first business was… online selling. Man… It didn't work out. And then I got into food outlets. I got a bit lucky. I started to think maybe that was the start for me. That's all I worked on. And now… My friends got married before they hit their thirties. But me? To Marrakesh? Where you can buy any art piece without even having to worry about how much it would cost, am I right, Brix? Well, that's one of the things. It's Violet. Sir, I'll send you the address of the painting's beneficiary. Anyway, do you know where this is? Do you mind if we go? Gosh, Ma. Is there something you want me to solve? If I solve it, will it bring you back? Yes. Can you please contact Violet? Okay, sir. Just passing through. Just call me Brix. Do I have to be honest? Okay. I have nothing to hide anyway. I guess it has always been… my relationship with my father that I never got to fix. Well, no one can say that he was… a perfect father, but… We never had any problems. I think it might be the way he was raised by his own parents. He was very strict, and he wanted me to follow in his footsteps. But I really didn't want to. I never wanted to be an architect. It must have hurt him… that I didn't follow his wishes. He said a lot of very hurtful words. I can't remember them now. Maybe it means I've moved on. Maybe I've forgiven him. I hope he has… forgiven me too. I think she was truly happy when our family was still together. I'm just wondering. There are moments when I think about… What if she never left? At least Mama made an effort. She looked for me before she passed away. And to think, we lived so close to each other. Really? Mom never wanted to talk about him while I was growing up. I would understand if you harbor some ill feelings towards me. No, Brix. You see… she took care of me when she should've taken care of you. I learned that there's no perfect parent. But… …the love that they have for their children… never changes, Brix. Serious about what? It's the only thing Mama Agnes has left you, isn't it? But even Mom would know that I won't be traveling all the way here just to manage this B&amp;B. It's so damn far. In the Philippines, it took us years to prepare a business just across the sea. Why? Because you're alone in the world. What happened? Are you able to maintain your cars out here? It's been so busy at the B&amp;B. You don't have a spare tire? How come you don't have a spare tire, Cathy? Don't you know that you need one every time the car drives out? We should have just rented. And you're asking me to manage you. I'm going to look for help! We're leaving it here? Let's go? We can walk back to the car. I've asked for help. Thank you. Thank you. Peace be with you. Cathy, I'll drive. You must be tired. The handbrake. Marabali. Let's talk later. Assalamu alaikum. Wa alaykumu s-salam, madam. What are you doing? Nothing. Just taking pictures. What happened? Is there a problem? We might need to pull an all-nighter. Our orders came in late from the supplier, so the contractor left without getting the job done. Can't it wait until tomorrow? We can start tomorrow, but we'll be risking more delays, so my staff volunteered to stay up all night and finish the work. Is it your first time doing something like this? Technically, no, but… It's our first time doing it without her. All right, then. Get some rest. I'll take it from here. Brix, I can't leave my staff. It's not that I don't trust you. It's just that-- So either you do as I say, or you do as I say. Go on. Get some rest. You see, Cathy… -The staff-- -I thought you've got it covered? I can do it, but I… …I think things will go faster if you're in charge because-- I feel like maybe they're scared of me. Your staff needs you, Cathy. I got it. Is that your sleepwear? There's a party. You're so pretty. After you. I didn't think it would be so tiring. I never imagined I'd be doing something like that. And do it every day? Me? I believe that we're all here for a reason. I'm not only here to continue what my mom and Mama Agnes started. They'll think about how happy they felt on this day, and it was all because of us, Brix. You know, Mama Agnes would've been proud of you. If she were here, she'd probably treat you more like her child, not me. Both of us! Mama… Jeez, Ma. All you had to do was leave me an inheritance. No need for that Indiana Jones experience, Ma. A lot of puzzles. It involves a lot of people! You even brought in Cathy! I can't push her around. I see you in her, Ma. It's like you left a replica. She drives me crazy too. It's hard for me to refuse her. I feel bad when she feels bad. Why is that? You know, I was already okay. A lot of other places, Ma. You could have gone to Cebu or Davao… There are plenty of places in the Philippines where Papa wouldn't find you. Why did you have to pick Morocco? Answer me, Ma. Ma! Hey! You just had to give it to me. But then, I did realize, Ma… You believed in me so much. That's why you put me in this position. I'm tough. I got that from my dad. But this is hard, Ma! I wish you were here. But all right. I'll fix it, Ma. I'll take care of it, Ma. We'll take care of everything. We'll take care of it, Ma. It hurts. We'll see this through, Ma. Mama wanted to do a lot of things. She wanted to sing. She wanted to write. She wanted to dance. But at the end of the day, she turned to business. But I know… that it was just a front. She would always tell me. I didn't understand it back then. "It's the roots, Brix." "The source." "They are what will make you as a person." That's why it was important to her that our family was whole. Maybe that's why she came to this place. She kept trying to make herself whole. And I feel that somehow… because of you, Cathy… she felt that she was. This is where she tried to heal herself and that part of her life. I wasn't a part of it. I never even tried to find her. My flight's tomorrow. Right. Hey, I'm sorry I can't see you off at the airport. You're deep in thought. Something on your mind? I just realized… I'll be missing a lot of people in my life. But Robert Greene was right about what he said in his book. Take me, for example. Two weeks ago, I had no idea what my mom's life was like. But now, even though she's gone, even though she's no longer with us… I'm sure it's the same with you. I know that you don't really want to talk about this, but… So I went ahead and made the first step for you. I had my EA contact your mother's family. Trust me. They don't know any details about you. If you ever need help with anything, just reach out to me. Me too. Peace be with you, sir. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. DEPARTURES Thank you, sir. Still the same in the Philippines, Dante. Dante, here's yours too. How have you been? I feel hungry. Let's eat. What about you? All right, sir. They've received the anonymous donation to the sanctuary in Morocco as per your instructions. Hello? Who is this? What is this about? Subtitle translation by: Ems Guerrero
