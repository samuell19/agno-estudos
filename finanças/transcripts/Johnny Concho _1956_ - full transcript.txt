Good morning, Mr. Concho. Poem, duke. You will be a hero, kill him. Shut up. Duke Lang, the great player. She is afraid of an unarmed man. You and the other founders of the city. Come on, shoot. - I told you, shut up. Duke, you don't have to tell me what to say to Mr. Conch. And he can tell his brother. You don't want to, do you? Well, here's a friend of all. Mr. Johnny Concho. Blacksmith He's coming for you, Joe. Are you ready to say, yes...? One day I will break his neck. No, as long as your brother is alive. You don't like that, do you, Joe? Smile and hate. Good afternoon, Mr. Concho. Did you undermine my horse, Helguson? He's behind. Helguson? Did you clean the saddle? - You did a good job. - All brands. I am very tired of him. Maybe I should buy new ones. The man is tired of nothing but his sweat. The man can't get enough of it. He sweated blood to do that. - It's not for sale yet, is it? - Not. Will be. Put him in the saddle and leave him in the sheriff's office. - It's guaranteed. - The last one was too. If you are not satisfied, the company will refund the money. Last time, I wasn't happy, but I didn't get my money back. - I gave you a new one, remember? - It's not the same. I'm going back to Boston once. I will open a store for ladies and gentlemen. Gentlemen don't come here, much less ladies... Good afternoon, Albert. -Mr. Concho. I didn't see or hear you coming. Mrs. Weels is not going to keep the man waiting. Of course, Mr. Concho. Did you get what I was looking for? - Yes sir. I asked for you. He looks good. Time in the coming weeks. I like it. I need a new blanket for my horse. A new blanket for the horse? Blanket, blanket... My wife always throws things away. I don't understand why it changes... - A blanket for my horse. - Of course, Mr. Concho. That's $ 2.50. This is special, $ 4. You will not find better in the west. - Cheaper for your horse. - It's not for my horse, lady. It is your horse while it belonged to Sam Green. - Big car, I bought it. - Buying and paying are two different things. - Sarah. - Good horses deserve the best. I'll continue. Credit to my account. - Of course, Mr. Concho. - Mr. Concho. Does he know anything, Mrs. Dark? I don't think I like you. Do you want to know something, Mr. Concho? I dont care. - Where's Mary? - Away from my daughter. - Where is it? - In the kitchen. Thanks. - What is soldier? - Not. Just bread. I like the smell of the food. It reminds me of when Red and I were little. It is difficult for me to imagine Concha Vermelha as a child. - Because? - How? Why? - I think of him as... - The gunslinger. Yes, for the gunslinger. I can not imagine like a lot of kids sitting in my kitchen... - He's sitting next to a bully's cleaning gun. - I think it's fun. - Funny? - Sure. Johnny, nothing is fun at Red Conch. You're wrong about Red. He's a good boy. And also smart. Did you know that he took seven lessons? - Bright young man. - He would continue, but... - Just what? - I just asked him to leave. One day, the teacher hit the Red. He said he was a little nervous. The teacher never did that again. Do not stop. I'ts very interesting. What did your brother do with the teacher? I don't think he will do that again. I don't want to know anything about Red Conch, except... Did he kill someone? Is that so? - You hate Red, don't you? - Yes, I hate it. - Because? He never hurt you. - He never hurt me. Did he never shoot me or hit me? You're right. But he hurt you. And it touched me. Johnny, can't you see what he did to you? - Looks like you're right, Mary. - Is that you? It's fun for you, Mary. You don't like who I am. And yet, I don't like it. Don't worry about Brother Conch. It's going to be OK. Johnny? Look in the mirror. But what am I going to see, Mary? Little man, what could he do? Are you satisfied now? I speak, and I do not like this. So, if you don't mind, I will have problems, big problems. And if Red disappears, it won't be easy for me. Come in, Johnny. They said you wanted to see me. Exactly. - What did you want? - I have an advice for you. - I don't remember asking her. - But listen anyway. Johnny, your heart is working so hard. - Yes? - Chances are minimal, because everyone in the city and hates it. - Everyone, huh? - I'm afraid so. And you, sheriff? What do you think of Johnny Conch? - I'm with the others. - Yes, I noticed. If you still bother, you will have problems with people. - You don't want me in trouble. - Then stop bothering me. And that goes for the other idiots in the city. Whether you like it or not, sheriff. I am number one here. If you and your friends don't like you, you can go. - You speak bravely. - I have a big whip, grandpa. Yes. What happens when your brother is not around? This will never happen, sheriff. No man can kill Red. - Remember this. - Sometimes Frank James he said the same thing about his brother. - The class is over, old man? - Yes, over there. It's all right. Start earning your money. I'll get the stage, so let me know that Johnny Concho would like to play poker tonight. Tell all my friends that I will be there. - What are you looking for, Joe? - Nothing, just that. - You are late. - That doesn't mean we have to go fast. Is there a letter from my brother for me? - It's in the bag. - Give it to me. You know I can't do that, Mr. Concho. - I have to pass it to the judge. - Give me the letter, Milla. This is against the law, Mr. Concho. Federal law. Don't worry about the judge or the sheriff. The city has both. Although the city does not need them. - Soft. - I'm not in a hurry. But, I yes! I have a lot of work to do. My ranch doesn't work alone. Why don't you call him, judge? Why don't you call him, Sam? - Maybe I will do that. - Must come. Do you think that due diligence will arrive in time? Koèiš said he could travel at night. - It's been like this before. - The worst is waiting. The doctor told me to learn to relax. Charlie, choïsi zahra. Do you think they will accept a stranger? - I do not like this. - They have an empty space. Apparently, they are waiting for another player. Great player, my friend. Harry, give Mr. Conch a lot of chips. Yes sir. Will 100 be enough? More than dos. Easter night. It will definitely rain. Concho. - Concho. - Yes, the name is known. - Red Concho. - He's related. Really? - He doesn't look very dangerous. - Blood relatives. Different properties. He wanted to see something that interested me. Watch carefully. It is a different type of poker. - Do you mind if I look? - Nevermind. We can start? - I'll bet $ 5. - I'll be right there. - Me too. - I'm increasing to 10. I'm coming. I prove it. 3 cards. Give me 3. Dog. Two. It remains. $ 10. Three ladies. I won? I'm composing. Me too. The game looks slow tonight. Perhaps we should raise the stakes. I'm giving you a chance to recover. Give me a chance to have fun. All right. I feel lucky tonight. I deposit 10. I prove it. Document and increase by 10. It goes better. And I'm increasing by 10. I am out. I document. You and me, what? How many cards? None. 1. $ 50. What's wrong with you? Will you show the game? Three queens. I am out. - And? - You will not believe. - I don't believe what? - Did you like the game? I don't know if I'm crazy or blind. - I think it's absurd. - If you changed the rules... - Maybe I'm right. - I saw a man with two 4..... as he says he has three queens. I am not blind, said the three queens. I saw the last man your brother Red Concho killed. - Red Concho is not here because... - It's his long shadow. Bet 20. Bet 20. - Welcome to Cripple Creek. - Thanks. - How long... - Just tonight. You know, we want to rent a room and eat something. - You're in the right place. - I'm thirsty. Give us something to drink. Thanks! Please leave it here. 3 queen. Hey dude... - Is this the only event in town? - Yes for now. - Why don't you look in the room? - When can we eat? In twenty minutes. It's time - Play some games. - It is better to wait for farmers when they come. Why don't you wait for decent players? - Want a game, Morgan? - I prefer to look at the room. Don't worry, we have running water in all rooms. The best place in Arizona. Clean sheets. You won't find a better hotel in a week. That's great. Yes? See you soon. - Does it matter if I'm a game? - It's a closed game. - I see an empty chair. - We would normally like to if he played with us, but it's the last round and it wouldn't be fair. I didn't see the last round of the game three nights. - You will have a chance later. - It's the second time I've heard that. I hoped there were no objections to my game. There is an empty chair. Funny, no one else mentioned it. - Funny. Donate. - Walker? You have money? It looks like you're lucky. Yes. - That's enough? - I am fine. - 20. - Where are you from? - Guess what. - Texas? - Okay, that's enough. - I'm depositing. - Albert? - I finished. Then, discard the cards. - Call the sheriff. - Because? Him .. - Do as I say. - The same. I'm building 20 and 20 extras. I'm depositing. - Cards. - What do they call you? - Tall man. - Two. - Are you from Texas? - Two. I live in Beaumont Towne. I'm changing. I'm betting $ 50. I have $ 50 and $ 50 extra. - Dog. - I'm out. - You should show your hand. - You will pay? Yes, I will, Mr. Tallman. Document and increase by 50. You just launched me. I prove it. Three queens. This is what I expected. You were confident. Yes I think. I learned to play poker in Kansasa and I was taught to speculate with my cards. You are a long way from home, Mr. Tallman. I mean, two queens. I say three queens. - I think I forgot to introduce myself. - He's unarmed. I don't like killing unarmed. Do I want what you want, Walker? If you say so, Tallman. You better tell me who I am, until a mistake is made. And? How do you want to die? My name is Johnny Concho. Concho. Walker, you know a little about Johnny Conch. Red Concho is my brother. I heard about it. That is, he has three queens. Two queens. Red Concho is dead. - What? - Last night, in a duel. A lie. You are lying. No one can kill my brother. - The man showed he could. - Who? - The man who killed him. - Who killed him? Yes. Johnny. - I won't wait. - Give him a chance. - Well, Walker? - If the sheriff speaks. After all, he is not armed. Yes it is not. I never had much respect for a man who cheats at a game. - Do something, you are the law. - This is wrong. He says I'm the law, son. I had to kill your brother. But I always did something for the losers. You have time until sunset. You either stay or leave. Let's go. - It's the room? - Upstairs. - Towards the street. - This is my room. - Is it the best you have? - That's the best. I'm taking. I would be interested in something. Red Concho had something beautiful for him. He had. I think it was a very good payment, he is using silk. Yes, I noticed. Poïme. Bags up. And something to eat, please. What will you do? Will you stay here? You heard that he killed my brother. You have to do something about it. You are a judge, I elected you, I... Sam, you have to do something. You can't leave the killer... You are the sheriff. And your job. - You lied about your letters. - Who cares? That is the difference with Tallman. He did something about it. And he made a difference with you. Free bet. Give me a drink, Harry. - Tom, they won't hit me. - Not? There are some weapons here, enough to support me. - You haven't taken care of them in a long time. - It is better not to waste time. - I want to talk to you. - Come on, call. - You know what I want. - Yes, but I want you to say it. Will you let the snipers pressure me? They gave you 24 hours, not me. - You know how he uses the gun I saw. - I'll take care of myself. - And I'll take care of mine. - Your? It's mine, I bought it. You forgot to pay for it. How you forgot to pay for everything. Calm down, boy. What are you doing with that car? - What kind of car? - My cat is mine. Do you have a confirmation? That's another thing you haven't paid for yet, Johnny. - You pay now. - You can't take my horse. It's mine, don't be silly. It looks like you're not going to use the saddle anymore, Concho. Why the rush, Concho? Closed Do you want anything, Johnny? - I need help, Earl. - Any cool? I am a little bit busy. This town has to stick together, Larry, you have a lot of friends here and tell them to support me. Very interesting. My father gave it to me. - That is all. - Please listen... I'll look. This case is very complicated. Give me a few days. For example, if you look here, that the marriage proposal is not in accordance with the city..... - I've been waiting for you, Johnny. - They want me dead. - I know. - They took my horse and saddle. Everything I had. They cleaned me up. - Are you determined what to do? - You do not understand me. They took everything I had. Because you weren't looking for a better job they took what belonged to them. There must be someone in this city. I remember when red he was alive and everything was fine. Now that he is dead, they act as if they know this. Johnny, it's not hard to find the man who killed your brother. What should I do? He's a professional killer. - I don't stand a chance against him. - Not much. It's getting dark. - Is that all you're going to say? - Actually, Johnny, you have little time and shouldn't waste it talking. I can't face a gunslinger, he would kill me. Most likely. Maybe I won't die. You have to leave, they will forget that he is here. I'll be back when I'm ready. I believe so. - People don't usually travel at night. - Not usually. - Why the sudden change? - This city is exploding. I wouldn't want to be around. Am I clear enough? - Let's go. - We go with you. - You have another passenger. - You have 10 minutes. - I can't wait, Mr. Concho. - I'll be here. If you do not mind. This is public transport. Where are you going, son? He's talking to you. - Do you think he's scared? - You think. He wouldn't accept me. It is said that you do not hear shoot it and you should get it right. - He intends to leave town. - I will not keep you here. And remember, the hunting season starts tomorrow. I put your things in another room, Johnny. Do you want me to help you pack? Call them. - What is it, Al? - I do not know. He said to wait at seven in the hall. - Because? - Tell me, Albert. - I don't know, I'm talking. - Say what you think. I am concerned about what will happen to us again. You don't have to say that, Sarah, we all know that, don't we? The end of Red Conch and his brother will not solve our problems. Mr. Tallman and his partner will take over the case and they will not stop. Are you afraid of what Albert will tell us? - And what are we going to do? - Not. Maybe not you, but I do. - What are you going to do, Sam? - I will not lick shoes like most. I have rights and I will fight for them. I will tell everyone. Except for Tallman. Sam, they are a helpless herd. He is afraid of what is to come. And, unfortunately, they get used to it. Don't make it more difficult for us. - Something to drink? - Later. - Where's Johnny? - Second door on the right. - Grandmother? - Yes sir. Where is the rise of the city's inhabitants? They will be here soon. My friend. - Yes? - Where are you going? I have work to do. - What you want? - They said you were leaving, Johnny. In diligence. It is true? You better get used to the reactions of others, Johnny. I'm going, is this enough for you? It is the answer. - Get out of my way. - You won't, Johnny. You will not get out of this. Hey, wait! I decided, Johnny, you wouldn't go. Get out of my way. - Is everyone down there? - Almost all. - What happened to him? - He found that even it's Johnny Concho. - If you need help, just call. - I won't need help. He tried to kill me. And you are trying to help me. Johnny, I think I'm the only one in town who wants to help you. Stand up. - They won't let me out. - Do you think you're leaving? Nobody thinks he can help the stranger against one. - You were never one of us, Johnny. - I was better than you. Red and I were afraid of us. You're wrong. Nobody was afraid. "They crawled in front of me, like in front of Red." Red had a gun. The weapon you killed. All gunmen in this territory they feared him. We lured you to Creeple Creek to part. You were hiding behind that gun. You're right. We had to do something. We had to end this. We will continue. I could have left at any time. We arranged for you to stay. Albert didn't charge Sam anything, free drinks. They all paid for their work. You were a supplement, Johnny. Like a church, a school. Just a supplement. Everyone has an income. Once a month. Johnny Conch fee. I have a full box, I want to know how much it cost me. Johnny Concho, an urban idiot. Everyone laughs at me. You're not laughing, Johnny. To no one. I have to swallow many of those pieces of paper. I will do everything for repentance. We need to get rid of Mr. Tallman first. Johnny, I still feel like I owe your brother something. Because I used his gun, he had his star. - I will help you, son. - What are you going to do for me? You never thought I was good, sheriff, did you, Johnny? I don't think you're good at anything. I don't think anyone thinks that. It was different for a while. I used a star in Dodge City, Abilene. Not many men my age can say that. I met some militants. Faster than me. I buried them all. I'm not interested in your life story, man. Johnny, snipers always have stories to tell. Always something special to have an advantage. I remember Jesse. He always had an inclined case. And Ringo too. He always used a loose case. I survived them all. Do this again. Johnny, I didn't go any faster. I was smarter. I will give it to you. Come on, take her. Sound tall, son? Come on, use it. Now! Is fast. It is very fast. It's not bad, son. Now, all you have to do is have the courage to use it. I bet you can, Johnny. You know, you have a big city here. Mr. Walker and I decided to live here for a moment. If he lived in the city, he would be happy. The only way to be happy if no one is causing us problems. Do you think they understand, Walker? It is best to make this clear for any application. Look, I killed Red Shell, that is, what was his is mine, including the city. What do you think? Sheriff, can you come here? Do you have something to say? You are an intelligent man. Give me a star. Come on, give it to me. As I am the fastest here, my name is sheriff. And I solemnly swear to do my duty. So far, I want 20 cents for every dollar in the city, you understand That is, silver, gold, cattle, trade, everything. Is there a bank? I better start because I want to be a director. Any objection? All right. You. Yes? Yes sir? My partner and I are your guests. By a strange coincidence, you don't have a guest room. Now, I am always happy when there is justice. I never asked to pay without giving something in return. That is why there will be no gunmen in the city. And if you are arguing with each other, decide justly. And that means that none of you are going to betray me. See who's here. The last of the Conchos. And he is also armed. Do you want something, man? I asked if you wanted anything. Otherwise, as I said, he will leave town. Can I count on you or will you walk? Use that, Johnny. Use the. What do you think, coward? Yes. .. I need a horse So you go? Tell me, coward. Tell me. Then I will go. Okay, kid. You can take my horse. I plan much better. A coward? Inverted March. Inverted March! Walker, isn't there a law on children who carry guns? Of course, sheriff. Bye boy. Johnny. Johnny! Do not run. - Concho, what do you want here? - Can't I get enough pi? We don't want problems here. - There will be no problems, sheriff. - We are not afraid of a. I remembered your brother, many men wanted revenge. - You are a big target. - I'm single and... Odiï, Concho. Now. When is the man doing this, sheriff? I don't know, but it's always better to be dirty. - Mary, I forbid you to do that. - Mom is right... It's a shame to go after a man like he is a man who did not have the courage to fight for his rights. Like my dad, Mr. Tyler, the sheriff or everyone else? Look, Maria, you... Maria, you can't... - Are you going somewhere, miss? - Get out of my way. He doesn't make sense to a girl like you, he's interested in a man without courage. I thought maybe we... Sir, you chose the wrong family member. I think you are right. She is very brave. Are you sure she is your daughter? - Can I buy you a drink? - Of course, Mr. Tallman. Stop. -Maria. - You don't welcome me. - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. - How did you find me? - It wasn't difficult. You have gone through several places. They said the same thing in every city. "He was here and the sheriff kicked him out." You're right. Johnny Concho, a brave man. Sit down, it's dinner time. The food is delicious. Like every night. I'm trying to change my menu, but I didn't think I would be a guest. What will you do? He keeps driving. I'm going to California, nobody knows me there. - You have money? - Sure, I'm rich. Two dolars. - Will you take me with you? - You are crazy? I didn't come here just to say goodbye. I love you, Johnny. You do not understand? What I understood is that you shouldn't be here, Mary. Or do you have a reason for that? How can you take me to Tallman. I'm sorry, you don't deserve it. You deserve more than Johnny Concha. He's coming home, Mary. Stay away from me. - I'm a dead mule that swarms coyotes. - Do not say that. What should I say? I'm rich, am I lucky? Or do I have a reputation? It will be good to say that. I just want one thing. Stay with you. Are you crazy or are you telling the truth? Do you know what this is? I can't take care of myself without thinking about you. Without food, without money and I am like a leper. do you want to participate $ 300. That's enough for a trip to California. That's what I want, Johnny. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. She found a partner. Husband. Husband. Congratulations, you just bought a coward for $ 300. What do you think? Perhaps it is better to continue. - Will you marry me? - Yes. So it's a place to get married. - What if there are problems? - They will find me, they will always do that. Hi. Hey. Hi. Who gets married in this city? Does he marry? Bonnie Clark. Clark? Wasn't he a marshal? He also used to be a gunslinger. I think he was tired of killing and changed his career. - Where can I find Mr. Clark? - At home. In the church at the top of the hill. Great nice place. It has a beautiful view at sunset. - Thanks. - Tell me... - Yes? - Not. You remind me of someone. - Who is it, Jake? - I don't know, Tom. - Who is it enough? - Some strangers. We know that. What are their names? If they are strangers, how will I know? Look, drunk, I don't want jokes. - Will you buy me a drink? - Why should I pay? - I have good information. - Ok, what do you know? - It costs two drinks. - Phone call. The man is Concho. Johnny Concho. It must be Red Conch's brother. Enough of that, stop curious. Yes. What else? - I see fear for you. - The man is dangerous. - Ask the Red Shell. - Shut up! - He killed his partner, didn't he? - Not... Red Concho is dead. - How do you know? - I know that. Bill Tallman killed him. Some days ago. You have an opportunity for revenge. Will you take revenge? Where are they going, man? Where are they going? - Where are they going? - Please. They went to church. They went to church. They are doing well. Isn't it great? - Where is the key? - The woman said she was coming... I said I couldn't stay here all day. Where is it? - What is it, Johnny? - What are you talking about? About you. What will change a man? Night... I was thinking about us. As we were, five or six years ago. You were a girl, Maria. You were different, too. I remember the day you entered the city with your brother. I fell in love with you this time, Johnny. But you were different then. Do not. I was no different, I was just younger. What will change a man? Do you want a character that will make a man a coward? Is that what you're trying to say, Mary? It shouldn't be difficult to answer. A man is afraid when he knows what evil is. While leaning on Red, I didn't know what evil was. I couldn't escape before. Red's courage was not mine. And when he died, I... Mary, I was no different. I was also worried about Red. But for another reason. I knew he would die someday. And I will die with him. I'm dead, Mary. I don't have that heart of disappointment. You. Get up. Are you Johnny Concho? I asked something. Are you Johnny Concho? - Answer me. - Not. No, I'm not. I do not think so. You don't have the courage to admit it, but you do. - Do you think he's Red's brother? - Could. Maybe she is his sister. The one who will suffer. Mr. Mason, take off your hat at Mr. .. This is not your problem, Barney. Put your hat on, sinner. Your friend has a better memory than you, Mr. Mason. Put your gun down, Barney. I don't want any problems with you. How about you, Mr. Mason? Do you want to draw a weapon for a servant of God? I'll give you three seconds. 1 .. Two... Is better. Now that the incident is over, I have to ask you to leave. Or you can join this couple in a sacred wedding. I have a problem with that You have a problem with Johnny Conch, I heard the man say it wasn't him. - He is lying. - Then? What's your name, boy? Collins. Johnny Collins. - That bastard... - Calm down, Mr. Mason. I'll be waiting for you, Concho. Can we continue the ceremony? No, Johnny. I'm so sorry. I did it because and I love it. I thought and would accept as you are. I was wrong. Maria. Everything I loved is dead. It just remains sad. What does a person do when he is in the dark? He will ask for help. I'm not asking, I'm asking. Tell me who you are, boy. Johnny Concho. So go home, Johnny Concho. Find the way out. - You mean he would be brave? - It would be honest. Honest and courageous. It's not easy. I'm afraid Mr. Mason's words were true. Am I a coward? - This is a known fact. - Looks like cowards usually in your family. - What do you mean? - I met your brother. I had a little respect for what he stood for. - Did you meet Red? - He was a coward, - Thief and murderer. - You are lying. Be careful what you say, Johnny Concho. You're lying, Red Concho was more valuable than most men. His brother was a worm hidden behind the power of death. Without a weapon, he was what God created him to be. - A coward. - Shut up, you filthy man. - Do you want to fight me, Johnny Concho? - He's going to kill me. It's all right. Take my gun. Here you are. To see if a sense of revenge flooded his soul. Kill me, Johnny. If this is your answer to a call for help, kill me! What should I do? What should I do? Choï at home, Johnny Concho. Find the light. Yes, I'm going home. There are some things I must say to some people. Mason and his friend can change their mind. I risk it. The spirit of evil dwells here. But the way of the righteous must be found. I will follow this path. We are not in the church here, reverend, out of the way. I warn you, Barney. Unfortunately, it is not in the deed.... what I would use for this situation. So I have to use my past. Mason, keep your hands off that damn gun. God be with you, Johnny Concho. Now, sinners, what did you say? - Maybe we should wait for the sheriff. - It won't change anything. It can give me good ideas, something that already existed. Mr. Tallman has his own unique rules and I doubt there are any precedents. We need to decide what to do before we start talking. - He kills one, Sam. - 2 days make a difference in life. From a man like Concho, I had at least a little peace of mind. Forget the Conch. We have to get rid of Tallman. Sam, if I have time, you can calm down and change your mind. Maybe if we kneel. That's how you want to live. Don't try your luck, Sam. He thinks better of it. I've been thinking since his partner visited my ranch. - I also had a visitor. - I came to tell you how much he hopes to sell his cattle. This will lead to bankruptcy. I do not know what to do. I do not know what to do. Sam, he's uneasy, he probably left in a month. We're just cheating, trying to hide the truth. Well I do not. I say, let's get rid of him now. A weapon is, as everyone knows, the only way to talk to him. How many of you are coming with me? I say, how many are going? It looks like you're alone. It is a quiet city, Tallman. - And I want it to stay that way. - We're telling you to leave. Get your things and get out. You keep saying "we". But I can only hear you. These men are with me. They agree that this the city is not for you or someone like you. See why the fuss? I have some signature papers. We have to obey the law, don't we, judge? - If that's what you want. - That's what I want. But I do not want! The rest of those cowards can crawl, but I can't. I fertilized this country myself, and I will not give it to the first man to ask! - Mr Green. - What? Do not. Do not. As Sam Green said, we have a quiet city and we don't want any problems. So will be. My office is in the lounge, I have to go sign documents. - What will happen, Sarah? - I do not know. Sam Green was my friend. I watched aka die. - I didn't help... - Don't say that. Everything happened so fast, Maria is gone,.... This is the most difficult thing, Sarah. Mary is gone. There is nothing holding us back here, Albert. Let's sell here and look. One is with Johnny Conch,..... - It will be easy to find them. - Tallman can't do enough. He will let us go, but he will not sell. - He'll take everything. - So we left with nothing, Albert. I want my daughter back. You listen Listen, Albert. Someone is coming. This is Tallman. He wants to kill me. - Mary. - Mother. - Don't cry, I'm fine. - Mary, my daughter. Dad, I saw Sam Green's body. - Who killed him? - Tall man. And what did the other inhabitants of Cripple Creek do? - Honey, nothing... - Dad, when are you leaving? Are you trying to imitate Johnny Concha? Johnny? Tallman, you have a visitor. Yes, but not for long. Are you looking for someone, "chicken"? - Yes. - Moe? So is. You found me, boy. What do you mean? I think everyone is surprised to be back. Me too. But there was something I needed to do. You talk a lot, boy. He's not the reason I came back, it's you. All of you. I came to tell you how stupid you are. He will come back living in fear. Just like you did when my brother lived. It makes no difference, Red was a thief and a murderer. From the same group. A scum who doesn't want a decent community. I know why he was part of such a group. - Concho, you have ten seconds. - Fight, destroy it, if you live like crows. - Concho. Are you talking to me, scum? - I don't think I'll leave it at that. - Johnny! Johnny! - Try again, scum. - Not! You did what you had to do to get rid of the dirt. When I leave, the job is over. Johnny. This city seems to be starting to grow. I think we want you to help us. We have a lot of plans, Johnny. We need someone young. A good person needs a good saddle. I'll give you one. Johnny. Stay. Please. I think I'll stay. Translation Editing and Sync WesternKasa/GM NOV2020
