Five years ago, we were all very excited about Mars. Scientists had proved the existence of liquid water on its surface. A year later, we were all even more excited by the news that the Martian atmosphere was warming. Everybody was talking about Mars. And then, nothing. The rapidly strengthening magnetic fields created a dead zone. There were no signals from our satellites, no transmissions from our rovers. Nothing. So... in twelve month's time, Macmillan Enterprises will be launching 'Initiative One'. Twenty-five, incredible pioneers will journey to humanity's new frontier. Twelve women. Twelve men. And here's the interesting bit. 'Seat 25', the one-way ticket to a new life, on a new world. One of you wonderful people will be the winner of 'Seat 25'. If you think you deserve this chance, then contact me, let me know why. And to all of you who choose to apply, I say... the very best of luck. This is Faye, or, Faye Banks. This is her life, or at least, her life so far. Faye remembers, she didn't always feel like this, but what 'this' is and how she used to feel, she isn't quite sure anymore. This is Jim, Faye's husband. Jim tries very hard, carefully planning the route his life is going to take, comfortable with the truth that hard work will be rewarded. Jim wasn't always like this, he used to be very different. Faye and Jim moved into this house three years ago, but until quite recently, she didn't notice how the magnolia walls, meet their cream curtains, against their pale rug, in what is now thier beige life. And every morning, while waiting for her coffee to brew, dreaming of Terracotta Red, Azure Blue and Emerald Green, Faye finds herself drawn into the colourful world created by next door neighbour, Peter, and his little daughter, Flossie. The small child seemed to Faye, a supernova of blazing colours and Peter was the star at the centre of her universe. Peter and Flossie spend their mornings exploring the Amazon Rainforest, lunchtimes picnicking on the Galapagos Islands, and afteroons deep sea diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Having given up smoking some time ago, Peter is finding it increasingly difficult to hide his habit from his wife. I cannot believe you! Peter, you absolute scumbag! June is the manager of the local leisure centre and since employing Adrian six months ago, has found an increasing number of problems, for which she needs Adrian's personal assistance. As her eyes trace the shape of his body, she experiences the feelings of lust and desire, that have been missing from her life for so long. Every morning, at eleven minutes past eight, Faye passes her work colleague, Teodor Popescu. Having politely refused a lift to work, Faye and Teodor are now left with, what seems like, their only remaining option, a slightly awkward wave hello. As he stands, willing his bus never to arrive and his day never to begin, his thoughts inevitably fall to the utter pointlessness of it all. Faye's journey to work affords her an average of seventeen minutes, twice a day, which she fills wondering at the life of total strangers. [Car horn] At around the same time, every day, Faye's father Terry, and his new wife Maggie, take coffee and the newspapers on their patio. Having spent years, striving to bring a taste of the Mediterranean to the South East of England, Terry and Maggie have taken early retirement, to start a new life on the Costa del Sol. Faye's sister, Pandora, recently returned from Kenya, where she might have been found feeding starving children, or building and orphanage. Adventurer, explorer and eternal backpacker, Pandora is back home and enjoying a well earned rest. Faye works in the Human Resources Department at the local council. She was recently promoted, and is now in charge of Performance Assessment and Efficiency Layoffs. So, I'm taking a big punt on you here. It's more money, more responibility. Are you in? Yes, OK. Fine. As I'm sure you're aware, we're under increasing pressure to find savings within the council. By streamlining the department, we plan to build on your hard work. [Loud sobbing] We want you to see this as an opportunity rather than a setback. [Inaudible expletive] Although Faye has come to terms with the fact she has little in common with her colleagues, she still finds herself waiting that extra five minutes, in order to avoid the morning coffee rush. As Faye took in the solitary figure of her colleague, Teodor, it occurred to her, she might not be entirely alone. It is well known amongst the office clique, that Teodor Popescu is a pervert. Since daring to try and dance with Sonia at the Christmas party last year, his fate within this tight-knit pack of employees has been decided. What isn't well known, is that for the past year, Riley has taken secret shots of his female colleagues and posted them anonymously online, under the pseudonym, Stalker Steve. Having never been invited to eat lunch with her colleagues, Faye eats on the same park bench every day. Looking down at her application, a familiar feeling came bubbling up through her chest. A feeling she'd tried to ignore for some time now. A feeling that, really, there ought to be more than this. This is the life Faye has weaved for herself. One tiny web, lost amongst billions of other tiny webs, all covering a vast planet. And most of the time it's the biggest spider who catches the fly. But every now and then, fate gives a chance to one, lucky soul. [Phone rings] - Faye Banks? - Yes? It's Mike Macmillan here. I'm just calling to say congratulations. How are you feeling? - Erm. - Pretty overwhelmed, I'm sure. Well listen, don't worry about anything. Just let it all sink in and someone will be over to see you in the next few days. You did it Faye. I'll see you soon. [Disconnect tone] Faye, you're going to be late. Right, I'll see you later, OK? Photocopier's broken so we have to use the one in Block B. Just so you know, Sonia's putting in a formal complaint about old Teodor Popescu and the Christmas party incident. Lucy and Pauline have both had enough of his attitude as well so we're putting our foot down. Got a meeting with Anderson this afternoon if you want to pop in? What are you doing standing there? You're not ready yet. You know we're going round to your parent's to help them pack. Jim. I've got something to tell you. Oh bloody hell Faye. [Radio] That was 'De La Rose' with Lay me Down. Now, with the winner of Seat 25 due to be announced any day now, today's phone in is 'Oceans on Mars: Science Fiction or Science Fact'. Well the scientists have been divided-- [Radio switched off] You OK Faye? Yeah, just work stuff. Had some layoffs today. It's not just that though, is it? I know what you're thinking and I don't want you to worry about it. I think we should start trying for a baby. I wish you'd talk to me about these things. I've been thinking about it for a while. It's the next logical step. It's what we've been missing. You feeling better now? Mmm. -You OK? -Yeah -Are you sure? -Yes -OK. So, I'd say I've probably seen half the world by now, but I think it's my emotional centre that's really grown on this last trip. I mean, actually being able to reach out and touch a starving person. You can't get that kind of perspective unless you've really lived. Well, we'd love to see the pictures, wouldn't we Jim? I've got, like, hundreds on my Mac. I'll show you later. [Terry] Maggie! Tell them to be careful with those boxes! I mean, I wasn't actually going to take a camera. I hate the idea of living life through a lens, but... Would you mind being a bit more careful with these boxes? They are full of very expensive things. Sorry. Has Pandora been telling you all about her trip to Africa? Isn't she wonderful. I did worry about her catching 'Embola' though. [Jim] You wouldn't catch me sleeping in a mud hut. That's why you're perfect for Faye. [Phone] Fenton! Jesus Christ! Fenton! [Phone] Fenton! So, er, who was Fenton? Oh Dad, you're such an idiot. [Maggie] Oooh! Oh, Jim! Terry, listen to this! Oh! Oh! You're going to have a baby? -Yep. -Terry, they're finally going to try for a baby. Well done my son. -About time. -Thank you, thank you. Thanks Faye. Wait for your Dad to emigrate, then you finally decide to give him a grandchild. We're going to be grandparents! She's not even pregnant. [Maggie] Let's have a drink. Faye, put on a pot. A pot? I want to celebrate. Look in that box Pan. Give us your mugs, glasses are packed. Bloody hell Pan, not that one. And none for Faye, she's trying for a baby. [TV] The search for the winner of Seat 25 is over. Macmillan Enterprises confirmed today that the applicant, chosen from over 700,000 hopefuls, has been informed, although their identity is being kept private for the time being. With limited information on the state of the developing atmosphere, nobody knows if the explorers will be faced with lakes and seas, or barren desert. As I'm sure you are aware, we are under increasing pressure to find savings within the council. This department has been under review for the last few months looking to increase our efficiency within... I'm so sorry Teodor. There have been complaints made by certain people here. There was a meeting. I know. You could dispute this. I could help you. Why would I do that? I know what people here think of me. I've had a stable job for ten years. I'm lucky. I'm sorry Teodor, but you've got till the end of the day. Are you going to be OK? Of course. Are you worried about anything? No. Thank you for the lift. -Bye. -Bye. [Jim] Faye, Chinese is here. Coming. [TV] Previously on 'In Cold Blood'-- Good timing Mr Chinaman. How was your Dad? Hey, what's wrong? I just can't stand it, I'm not going home anymore. What's happened? Is it your Dad again? Ever since Mum died, it's like he can't look at me anymore. It's like I don't have a family anymore. But I'm your family. We're two halves of the same person. You cheesy... [Laughter] [Anderson] Hands off my ladies. [Workman] I would ruin that. [Crash of bottles] Hello? Hello. Are you OK? Yeah. I'm Peter. Hi. I - I'm Faye. What are you doing? I'm looking at Mars. You can see it from here? I've got a telescope. Oh! How does it look? Mars? Yeah. Don't say it's red. It's... It's beautiful. It's small. But it's the only planet in our solar system who's surface features you can really see through a telescope. It's pretty blurry most of the time but if you wait long enough, the thermal currents in our Earth's atmosphere clear for just a few seconds and it's breathtaking. You can see shadows and the black canals. You used to be able to see the polar caps but they've gone of course. Wow. I've never heard anyone describe it like that before. Sometimes I like to think I can make out clouds and weather systems. But no one's sure of that yet. It's amazing. A hundred years ago, astronomers were looking up at the canals, convinced that intelligent life was living there. And here we are now, looking up at that same planet, convinced that at any time now, it will be us living there. [Alarm] By the way, I've invited June and Peter round for dinner tonight. June and Peter? Yeah, from next door. Is that alright? Erm. OK. Why? Well I though it might be nice Faye. They've been living there nearly three months and we hardly know them, OK? OK. You doing your chicken thing? Of course. Hey, you know that it's nearly 7.45? I'll see you this evening. [Phone] So please leave your message after the tone. Hello Mr. Anderson, it's Faye Banks here. Erm... I'm really sorry but I'm not really feeling myself today, and I'm not going to be able to make it in to work. Sorry. Bye. [Child laughing] Oh! Hello. I found this. Thought your daughter might like it. Look Flossie. This is for you. Thanks Faye. This is a nice surprise. Thanks for inviting us over tonight. That's OK. It'll be nice. Are you not working today? I should be really. Maybe keep it hush hush tonight. Yeah sure. So what are you up to for the rest of the day? Nothing at all actually. Well it looks like me and Flossie are going into space. Sounds great. If you're not doing anything you're more than welcome to join us. Flossie would love that. Yeah, OK. I'll come round. Roar! Are you a space dinosaur? Are you on the moon? -Is that better? -Yes. Atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down! What would you do if you had the chance to go to Mars? You mean if I won Seat 25? Yeah. Well, there'd be a lot to lose. So you wouldn't go? I'm glad I'm not in the position to have to make that choice. [Classical music plays] Teodor? Faye. I'm sorry, you're front door was open. I hope you don't mind me being here? I'll shut the door. I'm pleased to see you Faye. Please, sit down, sit down. Let me turn the music down. Would you like a drink? Thank you. I hope you don't mind me coming to see you? I've been thinking about you. Passed your flat a few times, wondering how you are. That's very kind of you. I didn't know you played the cello. Oh, I don't really. I try. It was left to me. Who's the woman in the photographs? That's er, that's Marion, my wife. She died some time ago. I'm so sorry. In our home country she was a professional cellist. I persuaded her to come to England, to follow her dream. In the end that was a mistake, she never found success here. Did you ever think about returning home? Life has a way of trapping you. Before we knew it ten years had passed. After so much time it's difficult to change. You must miss her. In some ways I'm pleased she's not here to see me now. To see what's become of me. Oh Teodor, I felt so terrible about letting you go. Not at all, it was probably what I needed. Are you going somewhere, Teodor? Yes, I thought I would. Will you be seeing your family? I think so. How long will you be gone? I have no idea. I may never come back. What about all your possessions? I have no interest in any of this stuff anymore. But, your wife's cello, your photographs. That instrument is not my wife. I don't see her when I look at it. And when I try to play it, I'm not holding her. But when I hear music, I can hear her. I'm thinking of going away too. I thought you would eventually. Somewhere nice I hope? I hope so. I used to be just like you. I thought I had all the time in the world. Then one day, I caught myself in the mirror and I actually heard my biological clock ticking, it was awful. But no one wants to be an old Mum, do they? So I made a swift decision and got pregnant. You told them then? No. Oh, what's this? -It's nothing. -We're trying for a baby. Really? -Yep. -I'd never have guessed. Are you Faye? Oh goody, we can start sharing horror stories then. Did I ever tell you about my agonising 72 hour birthing nightmare? -Posted it all on Facebook. -You didn't? People loved it. And the film. You should do the same Faye. Faye doesn't do Facebook. Peter's the same. I think it's so weird. Still, most women are only on Facebook so they can -spy on their husbands. -Well, I'll take that as a compliment then. Why are you on there then? Why indeed! I certainly don't need to spy on Peter. He does jack all but sit in the garden all day. Some people spend all day working. Some people, who have a boring job, - need a bit of Facebook to break the day up. - Bet he loves it! Bet you sit at home all day watching tennis, don't you Peter? I bloody would! Oh yeah? So you're going to send Faye off to work after the baby's born are you? No of course not. Sorry, no offence Peter. God, you are so lucky Faye. You're going to be able to relax, away from work, meet up with the other Mums and do baby talk, then wander round Mothercare, picking out really cute little outfits. Faye was just born for motherhood, weren't you? My beautiful wife and my great kid just sitting at home, waiting for me to come back from work. I mean, it's the dream, isn't it? I don't know. What do you mean? I don't think that's what Faye wants. Of course that's what she wants. That's what normal people want. Not everone's oulook on life -is as skewed as yours Peter. -Well I mean, it's hoses for courses, isn't it? -I'm sure whatever works for Peter and June-- -It doesn't work for me and Peter, it works for Peter. I think you've had enough to drink, June. Oh, well. Thank you for keeping an eye on it Peter. You know for someone so liberal, you do a bloody good job of telling me what to do. -Let's go to bed. -And do what Peter? I'm thrilled you're trying for a baby. At least we know you're having sex. Thought she was going to throw a plate at him at one point. -Poor Peter. -What do you mean 'poor Peter'? The man's an idiot. June's a complete cow. Peter's a wet fish. How they ever got together in the first place, I've got no idea. They make the worst couple. They must have started closer together but grown apart. Sort of like the opposite to us then, really. Jim, I don't ever want to end up like them. [Terry] About bloody time! [Jim] Sorry Terry, sorry. [Jim] No let me do that. [Jim] That everything? For God's sake, pull yourself together Maggie. What's wrong Maggie? Your Dad's what's wrong. My mother died in that bed. I wanted to die in it too. I've told you Maggie, I'm not spending two thousand pounds to ship a mouldy old bed over to Spain. We're going to get a nice new one and then maybe I'll have a decent night's sleep for the first time in ten years, and mind that car Jim. What terminal was it again Terry? 'One' Jim. Christ, how many times boy. You got a blind bend coming up here too. Do you think you'll ever come back to England again Terry? Tell me what I'd come back for Jim. The business runs itself. I can get the football on Sky Sports. Food's better over there, weather's better over there, and at least I can speak English and be understood over there. Do you know how working class you sound Terry? Christ, where we're moving we're going to have English neighbours. There's a bloody luxury. It's certainly going to take a bit of getting used to. I mean, I haven't found a single English hairdresser over there yet. And I will miss 'Marks'. At this rate I'll have to come back to get my hair done and do my shopping. [Announcement] Your attention please. This is a security announcement. Passengers are reminded not to leave luggage or belongings unattended as they may be removed or destroyed without warning by the security services. -You'll need this. -Oh. I'm going to miss you Dad. Come on Maggs, let's not miss the bloddy thing. [Radio] coming up to 17.35. And we're talking again about Seat 25. And I'm thrilled to announce we will have Michael Macmillan himself, joining us here-- [Pandora] I've got to be honest, I can't believe how selfish Dad's being. He didn't even ask me how I'd feel about him taking early retirement. What am I supposed to do now? He doesn't seem to care that I don't have anywhere to live. You both have jobs, you can afford a mortgage. I don't work and he hasn't done anything to help. How long are you planning on staying with us Pandora? We can help you get a job Pan and then we can look for somewhere you can rent. I don't want a job Faye. I'm not like you, I can't be tied down. Well you've got your Yoga retreat in a few weeks, haven't you? [Pandora] As if I can afford to go on that now. [Radio] If Macmillan wants to race NASA to Mars, why doesn't he go himself? Good question. And Helen from East Grinstead tweets: As long as my taxes don't end up being spent retrieving twenty-five rotting bodies from Mars, it's all right with me. [Pandora] I reckon dying in space must be like, the worst way to die. Even though it only lasts a minute or so, can you imagine the agony? You know your tongue and your eyes freeze and your blood boils in your veins and then you turn like, blue? I don't think that's very likely Pandora. [Pandora]It is, isn't it Faye? I suppose that can happen. [Pandora] And you swell up to twice your size and your lungs burst like balloons. Jesus Christ. Sounds like you'd have to be pretty bloody brave. [Pandora] No, you have to be really selfish. You know most of them are leaving wives and children behind to go on this ego trip? -Would you pull over please Jim? -[Jim] What? I don't feel well. Look, there'll be a service station on the motorway. Would you pull over, please Jim! [Macmillan's voice on the radio] Advances in science, medicine, technology. These are the thing that will be firing these brave people. These explorers may have felt deep isolation here on Earth. They may be disillusioned with the path their lives have taken. But these are people who care deeply about humanity. These people won't be thinking about what they'll be losing, but about what they'll be gaining. This mission isn't about running away. It'll be an opportunity for them to fall in love with life again. Faye. Where are you going? Please Jim, stop following me. Er, why? What's the matter? Go away. Fine. Jim... You're pathetic. I'm leaving you. No you're not. I don't know what the hell is wrong with you at the moment, but I'm sick of it. -It's not about you. -You're damn right it's not about me. I've always been there for you. I mean, where are your friends? Where are your family? I'm all you've got left and this is how you treat me. -I'm sorry. -But that's not good enough. Things have got to change. I don't know how to change? [Door knock] Hello Faye, my name is Jeanie. I'm from Macmillan Enterprises. Can I come in? Please, sit down Faye. Well first of all, I'd like to say congratulations. You must be thrilled. I'm a personal representative of Mike Macmillan. I'm sorry he couldn't be here today but I'm afraid he doesn't like to leave the Hub much anymore. Unfortunately the press have managed to get information about our competition winner and will at this moment be finding out that it is you who have won Seat 25. [Phone rings] Now, I'm sure you are aware that the ticket you have recently won is extremely valuable and must be treated accordingly. Do you realise how many people would want to take that ticket from you Faye? How much that ticket could be worth? Well, if you're happy with that, I'd like to briefly talk about the contract, if I may? At the moment, you have only shown an interest in our mission to Mars and are under no obligation to take things further. Of course, we are extremely hopeful that you will join us and so we are inviting you to a primary meeting with Mr. Macmillan, this Friday at the Hub. All OK? You may feel alone at the moment Faye but you're certainly not. Do you inderstand? Goodbye then Faye. We are all so looking forward to getting to know you better. Yes, as we expected. Not to worry. If you have any problems just let us know. You know where we are. Godbye then Faye. [Shouts from reporters] Morning. I had the worst night's sleep. And that room gives me the creeps. I'm surprised Jim lets you put up all that space crap. Put the kettle on, would you? Coffee, yes. [TV plays in the background] The BBC reckon they know who's won the Seat 25 thing. They're about to announce it apparently. Oi! I was watching that. [News anchor] The identity of the Seat 25 competition winner has finally been revealed. We've had our information confirmed by Macmillan Enterprises and have just had a personal announcement-- Er, Faye? Did you know there's a load of people standing in the driveway? What the hell are they doing? Erm, hello? What are you doing? Go away. They must have the wrong house or something. What the... That woman just took a photo of me, cheeky cow! [Shouts from reporters] What's happening? What have I done? You haven't really won Seat 25 Faye. I mean, they've oviously made a mistake. No. I won it. What? Everyone's going to know now. Jim! Jim's going to find out! You haven't told Jim? I meant to. Bloody hell Faye! You decide to go to Mars forever and you forget to tell your husband? [Shouting outside] Oh crap. Jim's back Faye and he doesn't look very happy. It looks like he's arguing with someone. Oh, Jim's having a fight with one of them. OMG! He's just punched a man in the face! -Come look Faye! Faye? -Tell Jim I'm not here. [Inaudible shouts] Where is she? Upstairs. What the hell is going on Faye? -Please Jim, let me explain. -Is it true? Just tell me, is it true? -Yes. -Christ! -But listen-- -No, you listen. Do you know how humiliating this is for me? Were you trying to make me look stupid? No, I was trying to tell you, -I've been trying to tell you. -Tell me what? What, that you fancy flying off to the other side of the Solar System? For what? A holiday? What is going on -in that stupid little head of yours? -Stop it. This is a marriage Faye. -But I'm not happy. -Neither am I. You don't make me happy Faye. You make no attempt to make me happy. -I've tried. It's not that I don't care about you. -Oh, don't you dare. Don't you dare try and make out like this is somehow my fault. No! No, this is no one's fault, -this just isn't working anymore. -Faye! Faye, come back! [Jim] I'm sorry! Can't go in there. What's happened? Killed himself, hasn't he? Teodor? I don't know his name. One of my kids saw him through the window, hanging from a light fitting. Nasty shock for him. Mind you, I suppose he sees worse on his computer games. How d'you know him? We work together. Oh, so he did work then? Better than most of them round here. Wonder what made him do it. Nasty way to go. Excuse me. DC Poole. Can I have a quick word please? I saw you up at the door there. Are you a family member? Erm, no, we work together. -He's a friend. -And you are? Er, Faye. Faye Banks. When was the last time you saw Mr. Popescu? I saw him two nights ago but he was meant to be leaving today. -Leaving? -He was going to see his family. -Family? -Yes. Look, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Mr. Popescu died in the early hours of yesterday morning. It doesn't make any sense. Do you get the impression he was unhappy about anything? I don't know. He said he was going home. You mentioned you were work colleagues, is that right? Yes, we worked together for the council but he, he left quite recently. I see. And Mr. Popescu told you -he was going to visit his family, is that right? -Yes. Right. Only, Mr. Popescu didn't have any family. [Sound of a twig snapping] [Teacher] So what was so remarkable about Helen Sharman? Not only was she the first Briton in space, she was also a woman. How many of you girls will leave such an impression? [Party music] He's completely wrong for you Faye. I don't know what you want me to say. I know it's not in science, but it's a job. We need the money. Faye, where have you been? Are you leaving? Yes. I never for a moment thought they'd choose me, but now they have, I have to go. I'm so sorry. Remember when we first met? Yes. It was at that traffic light party when David and Susie started going out. No it wasn't. No, it was Diane's party when she had the giant chocolate horse. I went with my mate Phil, because he was trying to pull Diane. I'd totally forgotten about that. You were so quiet and shy back then. She must have said something that really pissed you off, because you snapped the horses head off. Phil always blamed you for never getting with Diane. Don't go. I do love you Jim. [Sound of a door opening] -Hi Peter. -Faye. Is it true? Are you going to Mars? Yeah. Bugger me. So when are you going? Pretty soon. For the training. We'll miss you. I'll miss you too. And Flossie. Are you sure you've thought this through? Barely. I just know I have to go. How did Jim take it? It's difficult. But he's-- You don't have to go all the way to Mars to run away from him. What? You're giving up on everything. Life could still be good for you here. I've made up my mind Peter. Right, OK. Well I guess this is goodbye. Oh. Yeah. Keep in touch. Yeah. Of course. Do you know, since yesterday I've had, like, 900 new followers on twitter? Oh, Maggie called last night. She said Dad's really disappointed in you. Don't worry, I'll call them. [Narrator] Faye's journey to work, affords her an average of seventeen minutes, twice a day, which she fills wondering at the life of total strangers. What are their hopes? What are their fears? Are they happy? With Faye's life now stretching so far ahead of her, the empty faces staring back at her made her feel as though she was looking at our world from a great distance. Her former colleagues now serving only to remind her, of the total insignificance of everything. That, no matter what, the Earth will keep turning. This is the story of an ordinary woman. But like all ordinary people, she is capable of doing something extraordinary. This is Faye. Or, Faye Banks. This is her life. Or at least, her life so far. Hello brave girl. Thank you. It's nice to meet you Mr. Macmillan. No, the pleasure's all mine. [Capcom] T minus 2 minutes to launch [Commander] Initiative One is on internal power. Setting SCE to auxilliary. [Flight control] Roger that flight. Faye, you are extraordinary. Your application moved me incredibly. You remind me of me, when I was a boy, looking out at Mars, totally convinced that one day we would be standing on it's surface. I am so proud to meet you Faye. You are prepared to face the adventure, despite the risks, and I'm more than a little touched that you're putting your trust in me. But how are you feeling? I don't know. Nauseous? Guilty. I can't pretend to understand how difficult this must be for you. If I'm honest, I can't see why you chose me. I'm not sure what I have to offer. You say that I'm brave and extraordinary. -But I don't feel any of that. -And yet, here you are. In spite of every obstacle. Can you imagine how many people would have buckled by now? I can. The journey is nothing, Faye. It is always the first step which is the hardest. [Flight] Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, main engine start, three, two, one, lift off, we have lift off. [Commander] Approaching 2 Gs. 2.5. Roger, throttling up. 3 Gs. Three and a half. 4 Gs. [Commander] This is the final transmission from the interplanetary craft, Initiative One, approaching the horizon of the Martian electormagnetic anomaly. We leave the Earth behind with hope for it's future. As we pass into silence, we take with us the voice of humanity. -To our families and loved ones, we send our eternal-- -[Static] [Commander] This is Initiative One -Signing-- -[Static]
