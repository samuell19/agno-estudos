Good morning and welcome to the national air show, coming to you live from earhart stadium. I hope you're all ready for an exciting day. We're off to a great start here, Bob. The hawks team showing US the absolute best of aerobatic form. It's a flawless performance, led by the two team leaders, hail and cyclone, competing against each other next month for the coveted superwings trophy. Their coach, the colonel, must be sitting on the edge of his wheel box. Look at these kids, Bob. They can't wait to be a part of the hawks team. Maybe the colonel should be watching the big red slide for his next recruit. Well, these tricks are not for kids, Andy. This is dangerous stuff. Hail and cyclone separate from the team, shoot off into the sky for their next death-defying feat. You're going down today, hail. Man, I fly circles around you every year. I'm on top of the world! Better enjoy it while you can. Looks like it's time for the big hawks finish. And there goes hail and cyclone, clear out of sight. And they come spiraling back to earth. Look at that spin! - Whoa. Oh no! - Uh-oh! - Hail seems to be having some trouble. - Oh no! Hail really needs to regain control. He's lost control. Pull up, hail! Pull up! Whoops. What a sad sad day for the hawks team. And for his flawless aerobatic performance, the superwings cup goes to... ace! And the crowd goes wild. Wake up, chump. Good morning, guys. I was just getting ready for today's work. Listen, dreamer, the north field is getting too much rain. And the south field is too dry. - I'm on it. - Of course you are. It's your job. Hey, champion... Don't break your trophy. Someday I'll get a real trophy. Ace, ace, ace, ace, ace! Ace! Get your head out of the clouds! Ace, ace! It's time to get your wings into some real clouds, you dillydallier! So hurry up! Oh, I'll hurry up. ♪ When all is falling down, you're at your low ♪ ♪ with nothing left to say and nowhere to go ♪ ♪ hold on to the sound of the life ♪ - ♪ coming down... ♪ - Someday my dreams will come true. I'll show them. Uh-oh, what's that? What will the two-time champion ace do next? ♪ Hold on, here we go ♪ - ♪ I can't wait... ♪ - Wow! Such amazing maneuvers! And now it's on to the next challenge for the five-time world champion ace! What matters here is not only speed, but also accuracy. Yes, and his timing is perfect as always. That's why he's the reigning champion. Bravo, ace! You're a winner. And the audience totally loves him. He's got them wrapped around his little wing flap. - Ace, ace, ace... - Oh yes. The 10-time superwings champion has many many admirers. And now for the death-defying loop de loop! That one's for the ladies. - We love you, ace! - Okay, who wants my autograph? Hmph, someday. - Attention, attention. - Calling all planes. Do you dream of being a champion aerobatic flyer? Can this be real? The hawks team is now accepting applications. All interested applicants should proceed to the stadium for an interview right away. I gotta lay off the antifreeze. Experience with clouds and a strong ability to daydream is preferred. That wasn't over the top. Miss rotor, send Davidson in here. Right away, Mr. Cumberbun. What's your progress report, Davidson? We've got all the boys training for the big superwings show. - That's next month. - But you still have not found a new member? Find someone now. Someone that won't be so easily scared off by cyclone during training. - We have been trying. - And I want finding! But cyclone says we only need four jets. The hawks have always flown with five. It's tradition. Our tradition and our teamwork... That's what makes US winners. Miss rotor can send a request for a substitute to one of the other teams then. - Mm-hmm. - But, sir, no one can replace hail, - not after what happened. - We all feel bad about what happened. Can't you see it makes US look bad if we can't keep a replacement? But cyclone doesn't want another jet, sir. Cyclone?! Cyclone may be the champion of the hawks team, but I'm the one in charge here. - You got it? - Yes sir. We're going to send a request to the angels team today. I want that substitute at the training base - by this afternoon. - This afternoon? But even if he gets here, there still won't be time to train him. Now that is not my problem. It's yours now. I want hawk #5 by noon, or you can kiss your job goodbye. Dismissed! It's time to grow the team. Whoa! Outta sight! I've finally made it to the earhart stadium. Wow! The hawks! I can't believe my eyes! Hey, I can't see! Oh, there you are. Hey. Hey, robot. What do I call him? Hey, spongy. Bob? I mean... uh, excuse me. Mr. Cleaner? Could you help me find... The hawks team? Whoa. That looks like cyclone up there. That is cyclone! Hey! Watch it, kamikaze. I'm really sorry. I guess my head's in the clouds. - Hey, those are the hawks. - How'd it go, boss? - Cool. - Not so good. And I'm out on my butt if I can't find US a new member... By this afternoon. Now how will I pay the mortgage on my hanger? And what will I tell my wife? Excuse me, but I'm here to try out. You're here for the team? - Yup, that's right. - Already? Am I too early? No, not at all. Those angels who sent you out here worked a miracle for sure. - Um, okay. - There's no more time to waste. You leave now for your training. Willowby will give you the details. Welcome aboard. But are you sure you don't even want me to try out? We're ready for takeoff. Get to the base. Find the coach when you get there - and train your little wings off. - Yes, but... And one more thing: Don't let me down or my wife's gonna kill me. Well, well, well, kamikaze, looks like you're part of the team. What do you have to say about that? Kamikaze? Where's your head at? - Huh? - Huh? Get your head out of the clouds and get your butt back to base right away for some training. Here's your map. Don't lose it. Okay. And here's your contract. Sign here and we're done. Okay. There you go. Didn't even read the fine print. What a newbie. Welcome officially to the hawks team. Superwings is in just one month. You're replacing hail, the greatest pilot that ever lived, - but no pressure. - Whoa. Wait a second. I'll be performing at superwings? Well, you catch on fast. No wonder the angels sent you so quickly. Welcome to the hawks, kamikaze. - Don't let US down. - Whoa. What a day. I guess dreams really do come true. Now if I could only find the base. Man, it's windy up here. I can't believe I lost that map. The base has got to be around here somewhere. Whoa. Looks tricky up ahead. Oh! Wha... hey. Huh? Ow ow ow ow ow ow! Hey, who are you? No hitchhikers! They're back! Excuse me, but do you know where I am? Hello? Shh! Hey, you there! - Huh? - Yeah. Where are you? Is the coast clear? Will you look around and see if there's any blackbirds out there? Not that I'm afraid of them or anything. - I'm just... I was just curious. - Who's there? - I'm stuck. - Stuck? That's a strange name for a cement mixer. I'll tell you my name if you get me out of here! I just... oh! Oh! Oh. Thank you, I guess. Are you okay? I was stuck, now I'm in pain. Thank you. Thanks for the heart attack, needle nose. Are you some kind of a chicken? A chicken? As if! I'm dodo, and it's my job around here to keep the blackbirds away from those engines. Now most people don't appreciate that kind of thing, because... you know, 'cause I don't technically really work here. But it's a thing that I do that I take a lot of pride in, - to be honest with you. - Blackbirds, huh? Interesting. So is that who you're hiding from? From blackbirds? That's insane! I prefer the term "avoiding," but, you know. - So you're not afraid? - They've got their issues, I got mine and... - It's not that I'm scared. - Look, a blackbird! What, blackbirds? Where? Don't let 'em touch me. - Please protect me. - You're funny for a chicken. All right, wise guy. What are you doing here, anyway? I'm on my way to go train for the superwings contest. - You? - You don't believe me? It's true. A famous coach is waiting for me at the base, - and he only works with real winners. - How do I say this lightly? You don't really seem the winning type to me, guy. You're more of a fifth-place guy. Anyway, the coaches are there. - Show me. - Ah! I told you it's pointless. You're wasting - your time and mine. - But I just helped you. You tried to turn me into a shish kebab. Jeez. Okay then. Bye. Have fun with your little friends. Hmm? Hey! Hey, wait! Hey, kid, I was kidding... Slightly exaggerating! - Wait a minute! I know you can be a winner... ...or at least second place. Have no fear, my friend. From here on out, it's easy-peasy. Dodo is your copilot. Maybe this wasn't the best idea. ♪ Off we go into the wild blue... ♪ Yonder! Are you sure this is the base? Well, it ain't Santa's workshop. It's just... Different than I imagined. It's like a really nice junkyard. Shh! Wait here. Nobody can see US. - What? - Shh! - We gotta sneak you in here. - Why? Come on. Luckily, the security stinks. Go quietly. - We gotta be very sneaky. - Why? What's up? Shh! Quiet now. Okay, we're not supposed to be here. - Why? - We gotta keep quiet. - They could be here? - Who's "they"? They. - Walk this way. - Oh. Oh. - Just tiptoe tiptoe tiptoe. - Not like that. - That looks weirder than if we were making more noise. Stop right there. - Good lord! - Oh, it's you, dodo. We told you before... Planes only. Major munson, Patrick, I've got one. He's looking for someone or something. You're looking for what now? - You looking for trouble? - I'm here to see the coach. I was told they were expecting to see me today. And again, no one tells US. You're in luck. The coach we have here is the best, and it's almost time for our practice. See? Easy-peasy. So why are these trucks on a planes-only base? Dodo, please don't cause any trouble until I see the coach. I'm just saying at least I can fly. - So fly away then. - You're embarrassing me. Okay, I'll go practice my sleep. Here we are. And here comes the coach. Hey. - Wow. - Gentlemen, start your engines. Boys, full throttle. Let's show them how we take off downtown, shall we? Oh boy. Oh yeah, oh there. - Oh wait. - Ohhh. And one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Keep to the beat, guys. - Two, three. Over there on the left. Two, three. - And stretch. What's with all the huffing and puffing? You're disturbing my sleep practice. - Good morning. - Uh, hi. Hmm? Major munson and Patrick, get in line and let's burn those buns, guys. Well, yes ma'am. Come on, step to it, Patrick. Let's go. Now is the time to get out there and prove yourself. Sorry, blue baron. That was my tailpipe backfiring. At my age I can't drive backwards like I used to. But when I was a young truck, we used to drive straight into a wall just for fun. Boy, were we stupid. Hah! I guess you haven't changed much, right, Seamus? Good one, wicketts. Come with me this afternoon. We'll go see the girls at naval aviation. I need a wingman. Hello? Uh, excuse me. Good job, everyone. That's all for today. Make sure you check your oil and tomorrow, be on time. Hey, Mr. New guy. You here to join our group? Uh, yeah. I'm-i'm... Oop oop... - Ace. - I'm impressed. - No, I'm windy. - I was told that you were waiting for me. Ahhh. Hey, cool your jets, prince charming. - We just met. - I mean, when are we gonna start the higher aerobatics training? I have to get ready for the big tournament. Easy. You've got to learn how to taxi before you can fly. But I'm here for training. What, are you a wiseguy? This is a retirement home. I'm the aerobics instructor. And these old planes don't fly much anymore and it's my job to keep 'em healthy and happy. It's a very busy job. Welcome to shady pines, Mr. Ace. I don't get it, dodo. I thought you said this was the base. Yeah. She's nice. Huh. Huh? So you met windy, huh? She's a stone cold fox. I'm Seamus. Welcome to the rest home. You look pretty young for your age. Did you take early retirement or did you get an engine-lift? Seamus, you're such a comedian. Don't get your propellers all out of whack. Whoa! Is everyone here a little nutty? Ever hit a wall... - Backwards? - What? - I think he... - Is a wee bit deaf. Good. Then he won't have to hear. Patrick's tailpipe backfiring. But then again, I do have an extra hearing aid... If you need it, that is. I don't need a hearing aid. I just need to find my coach. - Jeez. - You're new here, huh? What's your receiving frequency? - Hey, handsome! - Who, me? I'm Rosie, the air traffic controller. I'm unmarried twice. You must have lots of money to retire so young. What's your model year? Are you single? Another one slips through my wires. Wait, please, you have to help me. There's a coach and he's waiting for me somewhere around here. I lost the map and the bird that I came with is really weird, along with everyone else in this crazy place, - and the superwings is just a month away. - I see. I'm sorry, but I can't help you. He doesn't coach anymore and he moved away. Aha! So you do know him. I'm supposed to perform with the hawks in a month and he knows the program. Finding him is the one and only chance for me. - Who on earth sent you here? - The manager of the hawks. Look, flying in the show is my biggest dream, but I can't make it come true, not without finding my coach. - Who's this? - The new boyfriend? Hello, cyclone. So I go off to practice for a couple of hours and when I stop by your place to say hi to my best girl, you're here with some other guy. What's up with that? What if he's one of those paparazzi trying to snap a picture of the superwings champ with his super new girlfriend? I'm not paparazzi! Is everyone here insane? So who are you then? - You from the angels? - I'm here to find the coach. You're looking for the colonel out here? - Isn't this the right place? - Oh yeah, there's plenty of losers here. You'll fit right in. The one who trains the champions! Good luck. The only champion here is me, big guy, and there's no room for two. - Hey! Send this kid back to the playground, will ya? Hey, don't listen. - You're bigger than that. - Here I go. So you wanna fly with the big boys? Just watch me. I am a winner. Oh boy. "I'm a winner." Let's see what you got then, huh? We fly across the field, then up the mountain, dive over the cliff and come back to the starting point. - You got it? - Yeah, I got it. Hey, handsome, leaving so soon? Rosie, send me a map of the mountains. You got it. How do I do that? I'll show them I'm not a joke. Here comes my lunch! Hold on! See you later, loser. Whoa! Rosie, I need you to send me that map. Whoa! Like right now. And I need a new pair of underwear. Hey there, cutie. I'm gonna patch you into the map, uh, right... Oh boy, let's see. Where is that map? Okay. Well, it's gotta be here somewhere. Uh, oh yeah, here it is. - Bingo. Seriously, you can drop me off - anywhere around here. - All right, hotshot, you're going down. Not yet. Oh no, that says "warning." He's taking him to the black ravine. Rosie, connect me with ace. Let's see now... Eenie meenie miney moe! Got it. Ah! Brakes! Brakes! Where are the brakes? Now that bird flies strange. Anyway, I'm better off... Ya-hoo! Oops, not that way. Don't go into the ravine. - Whoa whoa whoa. - Ace, get out of there! Ouch! - Whoa! - Ace, are you there? - Are you okay? - I don't know. I don't think so. My wing hurts pretty bad and I'm feeling kinda woozy. - Whoa. - Don't worry, buddy! - I'll save you! - Whoa whoa. Somehow! Uh, how? Whoa whoa! Okay, slow down. That's right. Stop. Look at me. It's me! I'm your friend! - Huh? - Come on, now. Don't close your eyes. No, stay away from the light! Don't go straight down! Pull up! No! - No! - What's going on? They've left the broadcast service area. Well, that was a challenge. - What happened to ace? - So did you miss me? What did you do to him? Guess who won. - What did you do to him? - If they were any good, they wouldn't fly back home to mommy. Am I dead? Is this... heaven? I feel all tingly and wise. Ugh! You made it! Hello? Hey, buddy. Are you in there? Oh no, he didn't make it! Oh no, I'm alone again. I can't believe it. - I can't deal with the blackbirds on my own! - Are you okay? - What happened? - Huh? What happened? That was insanity! Inanity! Profanity! What, were you playing with the dials or something? Come on! Luckily, I was able to save you, but I might not be there the next time around. What the heck just happened to me? I got p.T.F.S... Post-traumatic feather syndrome! I've got a stroke, arthritis, or bad gas or all three. Look at me. Look at my feathers. They're separated. Something's a matter. I can't breathe. I gotta breathe. Breath in, out. In. Easy-peasy. Anybody home? Hello? - Whoo! - Hello? Ding-dong! Okay, we flew, we saw, now we can fly home. I mean, no one can say we were afraid. I'm not gonna say anything. You're not gonna say anything, - and I'm not gonna say anything. - Uh, what? Usually, I don't mind dark caves in the middle of nowhere, but this one is creeping me out. - What do you want?! - Ahh! I'm sorry. We just had an accident. Well, keep moving - or you'll have another one. - True. So very true. You are very smart. Words to live by. We will take them to heart, if my heart's still working. Let's just go. Guy's probably not in the mood for visitors. Hey, scary guys need naps. - Come on. - I need help. I really hurt my wing. Get lost! Yes sir, thank you. My friend here is actually an expert in lost-getting. We'll go now. Let's go. Let's go now. - Come on. - Back it up out here. You're still here? Go away! Gun! Gun! Duck! - Duck! Gun! - Oh! Never mind. My wing's feeling a lot better, - so good talk. Goodbye. - And don't come back! Oh! - Oh, very high. - Very high! - What's going on with the wing? - What? Wing problem! Wing problem! I got it! Okay. I fixed him. I'm a genius. Slippery, slippery, very slippery. Keep flying! I'm flying! I'm flying! - My wing. - Coming! Coming! I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I gotcha! I gotcha. Okay. We're... we're okay. Boy, I had you! Okay, three wings are better than two. - Okay, buddy, you can lean on... ow! - You're making it worse, dodo. Let's land this Turkey already. Okay. Aren't you gonna invite me in for a bit? A little tour of the hangar? In your dreams. Where's ace? That loser? He won't show his face around here again. Like anyone will miss him. Rosie, requesting clearance for landing. Great. Is that you, handsome? You are cleared for landing... On the runway to my heart. - Oh. - I'm hurting too! I'm hurting in places I didn't even know I had places. - Oh, you poor baby. - Ooh! What were you thinking out there? - I lost the race. - You could've lost your life out there. - I don't know if you're brave or just crazy. - Who, me? Well, a little of both, I guess. Great. Now let's go fix that wing. Bravo. Bravo. You are a winner, a big winner. Oops. Excuse me. Let the robot fix him. He's a big boy. And you and I can spend - a little time together. - No thanks. Suit yourself. Thank goodness you're all right, sir. You smashed your trailing edge flap. You're a brave lad. Now listen... forget cyclone. - He's just a big ol' bully. - We wanna help you. We know you need a coach. But how would you like five coaches? We're gonna teach you everything we know. Isn't that right, guys? Mm-hmm. - You betcha. - We'll train you up right. You're so kind, all of you, but right now, I've gotta get better. Come on, let's get you all fixed up. Hey, I've got a hurt wing too. We've all hurt our wings before. You don't even have wings. You can't blame a truck for trying. - Ace! Coming! - I'll be right there! Ace, I'm... I hate flying. - Uhh... - Let's get started. - No, wait. I'm not ready yet. - Don't worry. This won't hurt a bit, you big baby. N-Not with that! Well, maybe it'll fall off by itself. Hmm? Hey, by the way, who's that troll living out in that cave? - Oh, that's nobody. - He wanted to shoot me! - Wait, you saw him? - He just stayed in the shadows and yelled at me. I wasn't scared of him though. And also, I'm not scared of chainsaws. It's just... I know karate and if I'm startled, I could hurt someone. You know. Ow! Oh! All done. Once again, I'm the victim. That's it? Really? There, that wasn't so bad. Now let's put on the new one. Stop. N-No. I don't need a new one. I don't... I don't need a new one. I don't need a new one! Not right... Ow-wow! Eh? Well, bombs away! You were great today. Thanks. I don't think so. Me neither. You have a lot of talent. You're pretty brave too. As for the rest, it just takes practice. I... I thought I was a goner today. Out there when I was falling, it looked like the end. Then I heard a voice. Really? Your voice. Well, it's over now. What? Your wing, dude. It's all fixed now. - Already? - Yeah. You can sleep in hail's old hangar next door. Okay. Lemme find a worm for a snack. I got one! Okay, you two lovebirds, - don't do anything I wouldn't do. - We should be going. You heard me. - Oh! - Dumb bird. Well, see you tomorrow. You guys got a birdbath around here? Or a hose? Hey, do me a favor. Next time you get the urge to say something, just raise your wings in the air, and squeeze your beak with 'em. Jeez. This guy does not appreciate anything I've done for him today. I don't know about you, but I'm gonna just pluck my feathers for a little bit and go take a nap, Yup. Hey, try not to break anything, would you please? I'm okay. It's all right. Uh, I meant anything in the hangar. You're the one that's good at crashing and breaking things. Man, this was the hangar of the great hail. Yeah, and in memory of the great hail... Awoo! I'm crashing out. I'm beat. You're kind of a weirdo. I mean, you must know that. I just wanna be a champion, dodo. That's all. I just... I have to find that coach. What a sweet boy. I'm glad he came back. Are you checking out the stars? That's very romantic of you. Oh, it's beautiful. Let's get some sleep, you and me. Come on, let's snuggle. Are we leaving? I'm not exactly sure. I know it's around here somewhere. - Do you see that cave? - Why are we looking for a cave? And that map. Do you see it down there anywhere? I don't know. It's pretty dark up here. - I'm getting the heebie-jeebies. - Would you cut that out? - Wait a sec. I see something. - Oh yeah, what'd you see? A real world-class weirdo flying around in the middle of the night trying to find a piece of paper. Not nice. Hey, I found the cave. Now can we go home? - Hmm. - What are you doing now? Are you... dancing? - Hey, where'd you go? I'm looking for your courage. But guess what... I couldn't find it anywhere. Talk to the wing. - Let's go look in the cave. - Great idea. I know, right? Okay, I'll sit out here and survive. If they turn you into scrap metal, I'll give windy your wing. She already has the other one! I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm... Scared! I'm scared! Wait for me! Wait for me! Man. Wait, what's that? Unbelievable. What are you doing here? What's that... what? You're the colonel, the hawks coach! You're, like, the best coach ever, - a legend! - I made it clear the first time we met. - Go away and don't come back. - But, colonel, I was sent here by the hawks for training. You trained hail to become the greatest. You could help me become a superwings champion. I'm tired of asking you nicely. - Now get out! - Why don't you wanna teach me how to fly? You've got three seconds. - One, two... - But it's destiny. - We found each other, and not just by accident! - ...Three! Go away... forever! - You don't belong here! - Oh yeah? We'll see. I'm not giving up. I just have to fly in that show. I have to. Get up, lad. Wakey wakey. Huh? We're ready for training! - Are you serious? - Aye. But of course, me lad. We've got five coaches here for ya. Ready and waiting. Well, okay. Hmm? Oh. To win any battle in life, you must use camouflage, observe conditions, survive in any situation and completely disarm the enemy. - Ready? - Yeah! Let's go. Where is everybody? - Yes sir, commander sir! - What? Gentlemen, start your engines. - Ready. - Yeah. We're ready for training. Aye! Impressive, but what about this? Okay. Whoa... Ho-ho-ho-ho! I can't hear you. One, two... boo! What are you doing? This is resistance training. In a pile of garbage. And wet weather training too. I'm wet. I'm molting. - I need a shower. - Huh? - Coming through! - Whoa whoa! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Whoa! Whoa whoa. - Hey! - I think we've taught you enough for today. Well, what do you know... The circus is in back town. It's a bunch of losers teaching another loser how to become a champion loser. Well, that was quite a show. Really. Bravo. Not bad... Oh! ...for a bunch of old rust buckets. What do you want, cyclone? What a bunch of clowns. Hey, stop being such a bully. We don't bother you, so don't bother US. Oh, you losers do bother me... ...every one of you. Come on, guys. Don't listen to him. You guys are great coaches. All right, gentlemen. Time for a break. Request permission for an afternoon nap, sir. I'm gonna go work on my moves. Dodo? Let's go. I wasn't scared. I was looking for worms. It's pretty obvious. Mmm. Not you again. What is it now? It's certainly not gonna be a cakewalk but... I'm gonna make a champion out of him. Hey, colonel, watch this. Nice speed on his bank to the left, good show of self-confidence. The kid has potential. This is my dream, sir. So what's it to me? So I can't win without a coach. Gotta get used to disappointment, kid, - 'cause I'm out. - I know you blame yourself for hail's crash, but it was... An accident. You can't just keep living in the past. I really need your help now. I'll be able to do what the others couldn't. I know that I could be a superwings champion, but I can only do it if you work with me and teach me the program. You're off your thrusters, kid. I'm way too old to be teaching new tricks. And besides, it's gotten too dangerous. So you're giving up? You're gonna sit in your cave and sulk for the rest of your life? Get out of here! Hey, did you hear what happened to the great colonel? He gave up on coaching to sit around and rust all day. - It's my life! - So you're a coward? - Get out! - Giving up is the way of a coward. Hmph. Well, as you can see, I have a lot of work to do. Oh well. Oh well. Don't worry. You still have me as your coach. We're gonna start off with "basic blackbird chasing" and "avoiding danger 101." And "always looking good." That's a good class. So, I heard you met the great colonel. Oh yeah, real great. Well, he's been through a lot. Hail wasn't just his best student. He was also his son. Since the accident he doesn't even come out of his cave. He was the greatest coach who ever lived. And hail? Hail was the best flyer. Huh. They were like a dream team. Then one day it was over just like that. - Why are you so sad? - Oh, come on. You still feeling bad about that cave dude? So you might not win superwings, but you've got to look on the bright side. I found a good book and I think that windy likes you. Really? You think so? When it comes to love, I'm the king... the king of hearts, if you will. - Or the joker. - Results may vary. Now this may not work for everybody, but it worked for me. One day I saw this really cute bird... All her feathers were in a row and everything. I said, "let's go to breakfast." She said, "no way." So I brought her a worm and then I said, "let me take you to lunch." And she said, "what are you thinking?" So anyway, I brought her a worm... Let me guess... and then dinner. Yeah, so I said, "let's go to dinner." And did she? She said, "I'd love to, but my belly's too full of worms." Help. Get me outta here. - Okay, it's time to sleep. - I get it. Wake up! Leave me alone, Seamus. It's too early. If you want to be a champion you have to get up early. Get moving before I change my mind. What? What? Champion? - Let's go! - Okay, I'm ready. I won't let you down, coach! Well, I guess we'll have to see. - Yes sir. - We'll start with the basics of aerobatic flying. And they are accuracy, attentiveness... ...instant reaction, maintaining balance and poise through all maneuvers, never being late... - Never? Ever? - ...Never giving in to any distractions, - always being focused... - Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Not nice! ...and always remembering your goal. Now before taking off, clear your mind and enter the moment. - The cup. I must win the cup. - Takeoff! Come on, come on. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! - Ouch. - Whoo! Oh, and look out for the barrels. Huh? What's that? Hey, you're disturbing my beauty sleep. Handsome is up early today. And who's that training him? It can't be. Windy, your prince is on the field and he's training with... guess who? - The colonel. - Thanks, Rosie. I'll be sure to let her know. Oh no, I've done it again! You won't believe the latest gossip I just heard from Rosie. Hmm? Your little friend who daydreams about being a star, the fool, is out on the field practicing for superwings. And who do you think he conned into being his trainer? The colonel. If only your friend knew the truth. Oh, he'd see he's in a lot of danger. It'll be just like last year with hail. I tried to tell the colonel, but the old fool wouldn't listen. His instincts are completely gone. It cost hail his life. He already seems accident-prone. He's in grave danger. And he's at the mercy of a senile, old plane... A plane that was careless even with his own son. - Stop, please. - Stop what? It took me years of hard work to become the superwings champion, and did you even notice? You don't even care! And now you're being so nice to this ace guy... What does that have to do with it? The point is the colonel shouldn't be coaching anymore. He needs to go back to his cave where he won't be able to hurt anyone else. And your friend, he has to stop training, because he will have another accident and next time he will not be so lucky. Wait, we have to save him. Well, that was easy. Okay, here's what you do... Spend some time with your friend, go on a date, keep him as distracted as you can. Don't be shy. Do everything to make him late for class. The colonel hates it when people are late. It's his biggest pet peeve. And soon he'll get frustrated. He'll get so frustrated that he'll finally give up and go back to his cave. - That is rotten. - It is rotten and vile, - disgusting and mean. - But it's up to you. You can save his life, windy, or visit him in pieces at the scrap heap. It's your choice. What do you say? - Okay, I'll do it. - What? - I can't hear you. - Okay, I'll do it. That's the right decision. Let's get the kid home safe, huh? Then you and I, we can celebrate together. Seamus, there's a Navy plane at the gate for you. She says you're late for your date. On that last move... Acceleration was flabby. It's like you're half-dead. What's wrong with you? - I'm tired. - But we just started. We started this morning and it's almost nighttime now. All right, that's enough for the first day. Don't be late tomorrow... 9:00 sharp. We'll start to work out the program. - Oh! - Yes sir! - Don't get smart. - Huh? Yes sir. Tomorrow will be a difficult day and today was easy-peasy? At least he said yes, miracles do happen. - Good, I need one. - I'm gonna go rest at the hangar. I'll meet you there. Or maybe not. No, not moving... ...even for you, yummy-looking bug. Okay. Hmm. Okay... friendly. Hi there. Okay, you got this. You just have to distract him, that's all. You can do this. You are sweet, - you're sassy, you're... - Stupid! Stupid rock in my tire. Okay, try that again. Breathe. You go, girl. You so fine. Okay, too much. It's not true. I don't have flabby acceleration. What's a girl gotta do to get noticed around here? Hehe. Excuse me. Okay, let's try the direct approach. - Oh oh oh oh oh oh! - Oh! - Ace? - Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't be. That was my fault. Are you okay? Better than ever. You know, it's getting kinda dark out. Can I wheel you home? Thought you'd never ask. Ah. I'm gonna get you. We're friends. Let's just talk, okay? Huh? What is that? Blackbirds! I'm seeing blackbirds! They're out to get me! Oh no! So I was thinking, once training is over maybe we could go some place, have a coffee or some kind of... I don't know, synthetic oil. Well, why wait? - Let's go tomorrow morning. - No, I... I can't do it tomorrow morning. - I can't be late for training. - Whatever. I mean, I wish I could, but... But if you really want to, I mean, maybe if I'm just a little bit late, it's not that big of a deal, is it? - Okay, I'll go. - Okay. Tomorrow at 8:00 then? Wait, there's something else I want to say. What is it? - I, uh... huh? - Help! They're after me! - They're after me! - What? They're out to get me! This place is haunted! I saw them dancing! - I saw them singing! - Who? Blackbirds with ghosts in their burning eyes! It's a conspiracy! See you... tomorrow. - Yup, at 8:00! - Ooh! Somebody has a date. - Yeah, so what? - You know the coach. He won't like it. I won't be late. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Welcome to the cranky carrier cafe. Our special of the day is fresh spark plugs, and don't forget about our world-famous breakfasts. - All right. - Huh? What do you want? - A diesel daiquiri and an oil latte, please. That's all? - You don't want a world-famous breakfast? - No, we don't have the time. Fine, two drinks for the cheap couple at table 10. Our world-famous waiter rinaldo is on the way. Oh, lucky you. - I'm happy. - Me too. I'm not. Here are your drinks. - Thanks. - Thank you. Don't mention it. No one ever does. ♪ Up up away... ♪ ♪ Up and away ♪ - ♪ up up away... ♪ - Whoa whoa. ♪ Up up up up... ♪ Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa! Oh my... oh. ♪ Maybe I'm dreaming... ♪ ♪ Is this for real? ♪ ♪ Or is this how true love's supposed to feel? ♪ Do you like starfishes? ♪ Never say never... ♪ Excuse me, miss, what time is it? Ugh! The clock is on the wall. It's 8:40. Aren't you gonna be late? Uh, coach loves me. I fly fast, so I'll be on time. - No problem. - Ace, I'm worried. You're a great flyer, but the superwings competition is really dangerous, and you're depending on the colonel. Can he even take care of himself? I mean, he lives in a cave in the middle of nowhere. I'm just worried about your safety. Oh, he's a little eccentric, - but he makes champions. - Just be careful. That's all I'm saying. Windy, I have a confession to make about being from the angels. Your bill, sir. Pay if you want. I heard that. You know, I'm not here with you because you used to fly with the angels. You're funny and kind and easy to be around, easy to talk to. - Really? - Umm... oh! Look at the time. 9:05?! Oh man, I'm late! There goes my tip. Where is he? Quiet! Sorry. Ze plane! Ze plane! That's strike one. Sorry, I lost track of time. It... it won't happen again though. I promise. - Really. - Let's go. We have to work on a combination for the competition. It's a horizontal roll, tuck under the break and then turn on the heel for a horizontal eight. - Yikes! - I have to learn all that today? It's the compulsory program. There's also a spiral, nosedive, - rotation. - Hmm. Hmm. That's not too bad. Our performance ends with the flight of the angels. - Oh! - You should know that one already. But first, you work off coming in late. Now clean up that mess over there. Get moving. Pain. Yeah, that's jiggy. Hmm. Only two more weeks to go. Hey! Hmm. Hmm. We planes, despite being stuffed with electronics, are created in the image and likeness of birds. And it is from them that we must learn how to be truly graceful in flight. Okay, birdy, show US how you fly. Whoo! It's... it's okay. Okay okay okay okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I can do it. You should be ashamed of yourself. Look, he did it! Well, the first half. Man, what a great day of training. And I know just the perfect way to end it. Bug time! So nice to see you, windy. Whoa. Yeah, I got it. Stupid beetle shells, you know? Come on, what do you say? You wanna play some cards? Mmm. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. - Whoo-hoo! - Come on. Oh, come on! Sorry. Got a little excited. - Do another hook turn. - Come on, yeah. Now the looping reversal. And now the 360. Lifting up. Come on! What are you thinking about? - Oh, come on, wake up. - Ow, my neck. When you lose your concentration, you lose height. At 1600 feet you go into a full spin? What are you doing? It's too low! No! Try it like this! See? Check this out! Where is his focus? Ah! What's wrong with him? Ah... Uh, gotta go. Uh... Where is he? Shh! You're ruining my concentration, and we both know how important it is to focus. Now just relax and enjoy the game. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Aha! Now let's see what you've got. Hmm. Mm-hm. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Just what I thought. Hmm. I'll take that one. Mmm! Yes, I've got it. Wow, you really made a mistake on that last play. You see, I got the two greenies, two blue-ies and the one orange. I win. I win. Top champion, champion. I get the win, just like I thought. All-weekend winner. I win again! I don't have time for your silly games anymore. - Hey, don't be a sore loser. - Sorry I'm a bit late. But I'm ready for training, so let's go. Well, look who decided to show up. You can go back to sleep, your training is over. You have nothing more to learn, do you? I'm sorry. Come on. One more chance? - One more chance? - Be cool. Your want another chance to choose your friends over training? - No way. - But... superwings is in a week. Always distracted, always tardy. Competition is a matter of life and death. - It's the last time! - Enough. You can't fool me. I know you're not who you're pretending to be. With your technique, they never would've selected you for hail's position. Not in a million years. You think it's because I beat him at go fish? - Is that why? Maybe? - No, it's my fault. Oh, I'm such a loser. What's wrong? The coach got mad at me and he quit. - Ace, listen to me, it's not your fault. - No. I was always late and distracted - and just should've done better, that's all. - Because of what I did. No no no no, this is all my fault. There might still be a way to make things right. Ace, I've gotta tell you something. Well, isn't this a little soap opera? Just when things couldn't get worse. Something wrong, my friend? You calling me "friend" is wrong. What's the matter, kid? That mean old coach quit on you? - How did you know that? - The colonel was my coach. He hates when you're late. Windy was the perfect distraction. Did you have something to do with this? - Windy, how could you? - I'm sorry. - Oh, how touching is this? - But why? - I trusted you. - Go back where you belong! Hey hey! - Easy. - Loser. That was close. And take your chicken with you. Hey! Hey, ace! How's it going with the training? What is it that's the matter with you, champ? Nothing. And I'm not a champion. And all of you, you're just a bunch of rusty old useless geezers. Hey! That's not true! I'm not rusty. Huh! I thought he was different. Hey, what is this, some kind of comic book? Hey, ace, I found something. - Not now, dodo. - Whoo-hoo! Whoo! - Just look! It's so cool! - Leave me alone. I'm sick of your craziness. I... I'm trying to help. I'm your friend. No, we're not friends. You're just annoying, follow me around, ruining everything. You're just nothing but a dumb, stupid-head bird. I understand you're upset, but why be so mean? Just leave me alone. Get out of here, you chicken. Huh? Huh? What? What was that? Wha... oh well. Everything is clearer after a good rain. The fields glistening, purple mountains asleep in the west, the greatness of the blue sky. And there's something you can't see. You can't see the air itself. And it's the air that supports our wings. We can't fly without it. You young jets fly like US old-timers could only dream of. As a coach, I love guiding my students to great heights. But from great heights come great falls. Hail... he could do all the tricks I myself could never do. But flying... it's about more than just tricks. It's about living up to your best self on every possible level. Only when you get the rust off your soul can you be a true champion. Oh, how I wish I could do things over again. When my son started winning trophies... Everyone was so proud. I was the proudest one of all. And cyclone too. I held a special place for him as well. But I didn't notice the bad habits rusting away inside their souls... Recklessness in one student and jealousy in the other. They accused me of being... A bad teacher, father. Curses. Why couldn't I see hail's carelessness, cyclone's jealousy... Until it was too late? Much too late. What kind of a coach can I be after that? You're a good boy, ace, but your desire to be a champion is a dangerous dream and I can't survive another tragedy. Go home. Forget it. Find another dream. ,, Okay, whew. Who's a chicken? Me is a chicken? I'll show you what's up. I'll get you. Dodo? Whoa! What? Oh! Oof. Dodo, I'm really sorry. I can't talk right now. I'm too busy being a dumb, stupid-head bird. I'm so sorry, dodo. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - I'm not your friend. - That's what you said. - I'm sorry. - I lied. - Huh? You're my best friend in the whole entire world. Huh? Really? You're my wingman. Oh, say it again! - Say it again! - You're my wingman? Say it again. Say it again. - Wingman! - That's the best thing I've ever heard. - All right, that's enough. - Okay, I'm done. - What's this paper? - That's what I was trying to tell you last night. I found it in the hangar. Whoa, it's a chart for performing spirals. Yeah, and there's even more back there. These must be the coach's old charts. Look, it's all here... The loop, the eight, the spiral, the nosedive, the finale. It's the whole program. We can train ourselves for superwings now. Bravo, dodo! Hmm. This'll be fun. Oh yeah. Let's do this. I hope you know all the basics - of aerobatic flying. - Boy. If we say, "victory," that means hard training. If we say, "hard training without sleep or rest," - then we mean victory! - Oh! You men are all the same... You say one thing and you mean another. Ready. Go! - Whoa-oa-oa! - Come on! Whoo-hoo-hoo! All right! Yeah! Whoa! Sorry about that. Rosie, send me a tailslide. - What? I thought this was a family playground. - Whoo! All right, here we go. Come on, slow it down. Turn turn turn turn. Stupid barrels! Whoa! Turn it up! Yeow! All right. - Good good. - Awesome job. Rosie, how do I do the reverse tailslide? Hmm. Now lemme see, lemme see, lemme see. Oh, it's like a tailslide from the other side. - Okay, thanks! - It's easy... Peasy! Oh oh oh oh! Come on! Colonel, it's me! - Don't shoot! - Don't worry. - It doesn't work, anyway. - There's something I have to tell you. One, two, three! Yeah! Heh heh heh. So you see, it was my fault he was distracted. But you acted like that because you were worried about him. So he has my old charts. Hmm. Is that what you're trying to tell me? Yeah, that's right. He's been training very hard. Yeah, well, giving up is the way of the coward. And that boy is no coward. , And welcome back, folks, to our broadcast of the superwings cup, coming to you live from earhart stadium. Well, I told you, Bob, no one... And I mean no one... Has flown better in today's competition than this young plane. He's the newest member of the hawks team, and he really lives up to his name. His team sure is lucky to have found him. Where'd he come from? Nobody knows. But where is he going? Up. Well, I'm off to win the cup, baby. I'm not your baby. Fine. I don't need your help to win a trophy. - I can do that on my own. - You got lucky last year. - Hail would've beaten you. - Oh yeah? You've been living on borrowed time. But that's over, because ace is the new best flyer - and there's nothing you can do about it. - We'll see. We'll see you home alone, cyclone. Don't be sitting by your telephone. Ha. Mr. Cumberbun sir. I have to admit that it looks like we found an amazing substitute to take the place of hail. That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. - Who is that guy? - Who is he? He's the one they sent from the angels team. That plane out there never belonged to any team, Davidson. Now where on earth did you find a diamond in the rough like that? - Miss rotor sent the request, right? - I thought you had. - Me? Well... - Don't be so modest. That's some great recruiting you did there. Ace is a real score for our whole team. I'll tell you, that boy was just born to soar. Windy, we've got an emergency. Rosie, this is ace. There's a fire at the colonel's cave! - Holy guacamole! - Where is ace going? He hasn't even finished his round. It's against the rules to leave stadium airspace during a performance, right, Bob? That's right, Andy. Unfortunately, this will disqualify ace from the competition. - Coach! - Ace, wait! - I'm coming with you! Cave dude! And now it's time for a breath-taking performance - from this year's defending champion. - Give it up for cyclone. Coach! Oh no. Where's the coach? Where are you? Coach, it's ace. Do you hear me? Coach? Hot! Coach! Whoa! Coach? You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. , You're a hero. No, I was too late. It seems I'm always too late. Ladies and gentlemen, following our dramatic turn of events today, the new superwings champion is cyclone! Oh no, no. - No. - It's all my fault. Don't talk like that. I was never meant to be here from the start. All this time I've been pretending. I'm not from the angels team. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. They thought that I was hail's replacement so I went with it. I know I should've just come clean... Honesty is the best policy... But I just wanted it so bad. And I thought maybe with colonel... Then maybe I could win. And now he's gone. It's not your fault, ace. Don't you think the timing of this fire is a little strange? I've got a really weird feeling about this. Such a pity you guys missed my dazzling victory. Oh no, what on earth happened to the colonel? I think you know exactly what happened. So naive, just like hail. Well, nice guys finish last. Oh yeah? Let's find out. - You're on! Come and get me! - Be careful, ace! And kick some tail! - You hunk of junk! - You attacked the coach to get me to leave the tournament! - Yeah, that's right! - And you know what? I'd do it again in a heartbeat! And when I hurt my wing, that was no accident... You were trying to make me crash. Your powers of deduction are astounding. You've done a lot of terrible things, cyclone, and for what, a trophy? Winning isn't everything. No. It's the only thing. Come on. Whoa! Where are you? Oh. Hey! Oh! Come on. Hold your horses, folks. This show is not over yet. Here comes the superwings champion cyclone. And going head-to-head against him is... Well, I can't believe my eyes, Bob. It's... it's ace. My oh my, would you look at 'em fly? You asked for this. - My eyes! - Holy smokes! A dirty trick from cyclone. There's only room for one champion around here! You got that? - Ace has survived. - That's amazing. - A true champion. While cyclone's dirty tricks are sure to see him lose his superwings trophy for good. Hey, wa... wait a second. Isn't that exactly how hail went down in last year's national air show? Someone better call the cops and tell 'em to save a cell for cyclone. Hooray! Wow. Coach, you're okay. Good job. Not bad without a coach. Yeah, he didn't do bad with my help. - Hey, who's that behind you? - Huh? You know, I'm pretty sure disappearing in the middle of a competition will get you fired from the team. You were never a member of the angels, were you? I'm sorry. You'll never see me at the stadium again. Well, that's too bad. I was going to ask you to become an official member of the hawks, but if you don't want to... - I can join the team? - Of course you can. You're the best recruit I never made. You're the new hero. Because of you, the world of air sports hasn't been this exciting in over 20 years. Well... I don't go anywhere without my coach. Thank you. I'd be delighted. And my wingman. And I'll need the old fogeys. - Where are we going? - Of course, whatever you need to be happy. Hey, you. Looks like your dreams just came true. I can still think of one I haven't got. Well, don't let me distract you from whatever it is. Windy, wait! Go get her... - Champion. - Let's do this. Hold on. Oh... whoa! All right. Okay. Here we go. Hold on, dodo. Hold on. Here they come. Hang tight. Hold on! Hold on, I got ya! Oh! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! I'm coming! Oh! Pesky little... No more Mr. Nice bird. Hyah! You've got it. Yeah, that's right, fly away. Easy-peasy. There you are. - Hey. - Hey. Mind if I join you? You sure? You seem so busy. Well, I've been thinking. There's a time for work and a time for... Distractions? Well, I was gonna say antifreeze. - Oh, you were, were you? - Yup. A time for work and a time for antifreeze? And distractions too. There's really nothing wrong with distractions. In fact, some of my favorite things in the world are distractions. What's that supposed to mean? - Hey, look over there! - Huh? Hey! What?
