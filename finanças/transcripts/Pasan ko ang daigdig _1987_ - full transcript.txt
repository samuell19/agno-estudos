--== McEphie ==-- Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. It's good that you're here. I've been waiting for you. Did you earn a lot? It was so traffic. It's a Friday. There were a lot of people in Quiapo. Yes. So, maybe you earned a lot today. It was not enough. What? It's a Friday today. It should've been more. Where is it? Give it to me! Here. Is this all? There wasn't a lot of people. What? Kadyo, please leave some even to just buy rice. There! It's really good to spend money other people earned. - Kadyo! - Hey! Are you disrespecting me? You're going to fight me? - Kadyo! - Do you want me to beat up that face? Kadyo! Kadyo! - Metring, please? - Scold your daughter. She's too much. I may not be able to control myself anymore. Lupe! Please? Go to the kitchen! Go on! What are you looking at? - Damn you! - Kadyo, that's enough! Kadyo! Kadyo! It's a bit tight here. - Here? - Yes. Well, come back for it tomorrow. Luming? Hi, Carding. Have you talked to your friend at the club? Yes, he's coming. - Is Lupe joining the contest? - Lupe? I had her name listed already. I hope she wins. By the way, try these mangoes that Luming brought. My father brought it from Laguna. Thanks. ♪ Smiles we gave to one another ♪ ♪ For the way ♪ ♪ We were ♪ ♪ Can it be that it was all so simple then ♪ ♪ Or has time rewritten ♪ Why? We're just wasting our time. What do you want to do now? Why don't you do another number? Why do you know better than me? I can do that. We've been doing it over and over for a while now. So that's it then... You're annoyed. Why don't you sing it yourself? Do you want to? Please?! You'd see. Louie will know about this. You'd get it! Who do you think you are? Okay... Tony? Yes, Carding. Is the singing contest at your place on Sunday still on? Yes, and I told them you were coming. You'd be one of the judges. Sure. Maybe that's where we could find, a new singer. The one that's not to proud of herself yet, and an addict. Thank you. On Sunday? Yes, dude. Okay. I had your name listed already, okay? Join the amateur. You should practice since you have a lot of rivals. Isn't it embarrassing? Stupid girl! Why would it be embarrassing? Just do your best and don't get nervous. Wait, why don't you practice with my minus 1 machine later? I can't, we haven't eaten yet. Okay, so just come back tomorrow. And let's talk about what you'd sing. I already told the people here that, you joined the contest. Okay, after I get back from the garbage dump. And your uncle Kadyo, had his mistress, Bunny, loan here. And said to include it in your list. Your uncle is really openly shameless! Jo? Where's Kadyo? There! Did he win? He's unlucky. I'm really so unlucky. What's that? 2 character? Pong! Pong. 8 character. Sweet heart? The club isn't earning well. And I think you'd be here until the morning. I'll just go home. It's hot here. Okay. What? You're annoying me. You too. You're annoying me too. What's the meaning of that? It's up to you. Whatever meaning you want to give it. Damn it, not here. At my house. Hey! What are you doing? We were here first! Why? Is this garbage yours? You talk so brave! We can beat you up here, so you'd find what you're looking for! Hey! We got here first! Go there! What?! We're all the same here! Nobody owns this garbage! Really?! - This one's crazy! - You're shameless! - What? - You're shameless! Go on! Go on! Are you going to fight me? Come on! Fight! You're shameless! Damn you! Fight me! Me! Come on! Damn you! Ouch! Ouch! You're shameless! I wasn't the one who started it. It doesn't matter who started it. What I'm saying is. you shouldn't have fought those women. Ganged up! You didn't stand a chance! Touch one of them, you'd fight all of them! Look at what happened! They ganged up on you! They don't own the garbage! They might be thinking that they can scare anyone. That's it. You wanted to show to them, that you're brave. Is that it? That you have a strong will? And you don't back out of anything? Guadalupe, I don't know where you got that kind of attitude. And now... You don't have money. What that means, even money for my cigarettes, there's none? Right? We have some from what we earned yesterday. You don't have any gimmick. How will you earn? You don't have any imagination. I was already being carried by... Lupe, when we go around. With that, we can have 50 in a day. Is that a gimmick already? You're really a cripple? The gimmick is the blind that plays the harmonica. And plays the guitar. Or carries a baby. That's what you should do. You can rent a child, carry it, and that's the gimmick. Lupe? Why don't we try what your uncle Kadyo is saying? I'll just look for another job. I can sell corn. Or sew bags. Okay. But what are we going to eat? While you don't have the money yet? Mother? Are going to argue about this again, Lupe? I just want to get out of here. What? What are you whispering about? I said, I just want to get out of here. There.

Just think that you're singing to yourself. What? When we were in elementary, and you lead the flag ceremony, you weren't shy. That's different. What's different about it? It's the same thing. There! Do it again. So, Lupe? The tape might be all worn out and you haven't learned how to sing it yet.

Do you want this? That's what I like about you. You're so feisty! Stop it, Greco! Ouch! - You're such a snob! - Dude! Dude. Just leave her to me. Okay? Okay, fine. Carding? Thank you. Lupe? We haven't had time to talk for a while. Are you avoiding me? I feel ashamed with you. With your mother too. And the other decent people here. I go to your place frequently. But you always hide from me. A lot has changed, Carding. Ever since my father and yours died. And we're not little kids anymore. But you know what? Even if we know how hard our lives are here, we're still happy, right? Lupe, why don't you stop begging for alms? How about my mother? You can help her in other ways. How? Lupe, don't be angry. Your uncle Kadyo is ordering the both of you, to beg, right? That's old news, Carding. Such a waste. If only I studied in school. Maybe my future here won't be that bleak. You're lucky. Though you're just a waiter, you earn big at the club, where you work. My mother and I, my God, Carding. We're beggars, and we're being made to support uncle Kadyo. Why do you agree to that? Okay. Lupe? Okay. Thanks again. Lupe, what's happening? What are you still doing there? It's mid day. It's a Wednesday. What is it? Mother? I don't want to beg anymore. What? I don't want to beg anymore. I don't want to dig the garbage. I'm so ashamed. What? We're going to die of hunger! Is that it? Mother, you're old. You need to rest. I'll rest... When my feet dies. I know that you're forced to do this. We're begging because of uncle Kadyo, who only knows how to gamble. We beg, since somehow, we can earn without capital, except for carrying me. Fifty. Sixty pesos per day. It's not bad. Your uncle Kadyo gambles, because he hopes to earn. Where did he get the money to put up this house? From what he won from gambling. This is better than the other houses out there. Ever since your father died, Kadyo is the one who helped us. When I got sick, he did everything so I could be saved. But we got unlucky. I was unlucky. And your uncle Kadyo was unlucky too. But this bad luck would pass. That's why I don't want to hear, any hurtful words about him. What I wanted to say was... I can look for other jobs. What kind of job will you get? You'd steal, is that it? Or you'd sell yourself? What? Come on, tell me. What kind of job would you do? A singer, mother. What? Singer. The one who sings at a club. Singer. Mother? I always win at the amateur contests I join, right? At funerals, they always ask me to sing. At weddings. And at school when I was studying, they always ask me to sing at programs. But you don't know how to speak English fluently. The trend now is, the songs are in English. How will you do that? So I'd sing the ones in Tagalog. Mother? I'm really embarrassed with what we're doing. Embarrassed? Why would you be embarrassed? Are you stealing? Are they the ones feeding you? With people like us, Guadalupe, it's more honorable to beg.

Congratulations! - Thank you! - It was very good. You were very good. Here's my card. Don't forget to call me. If you have time. - Okay. - Tony, thank you! It's fine. 500 pesos. I'll keep half of this. In my whole life, This is the first time I have money, that isn't alms. That I didn't need to go to the streets for, and I didn't have to be embarrassed. And not smelling like garbage. And... Carding? I didn't have to carry my mother! The world, Carding! I didn't have to carry the world. Why were we born poor? I often think about, a chance to meet a man who's rich, and he asks me to marry him, I won't have second thoughts. Even if you don't love him? Is that important? How about mother? How many times she loved, did it help her fix her life? The people around here, they love each other, did they progress? It's frightening to get married when you're poor. How about when you have children? Can you feed them with love? Would love be accepted to their schools as payment? When your child asks you for a toy? A book or clothes? Can you say, just be contented with love, my child. No. I would never marry someone who's poor. It's not for anything. I just want to get out of this place. I will leave this place whatever happens. I will escape this place. You'll see. When I meet a man who's rich, and he asks me to marry him, I would never have second thoughts. No. At any time, I wouldn't marry someone poor. I will leave this place. Whatever happens. I will get out of this place. You'll see. Lupe? Carding! Have you been there a while? I just arrived. You're in time. Tony's here. Come on. Tony? Hi! Tony, it's Lupe. Hi, Lupe. Good afternoon, mister Gomez. Don't talk to me that way. I'm still young. And just call me Tony. So? Are you ready? Would you like to sing now? Why? I'm nervous. As long as you don't get nervous. Just express how you feel. You know, That nervousness is the biggest challenge of any singer. Just relax. I don't know how to follow the... It's not a problem. I'll take care of it. I'll follow you. Just relax. Okay. Let's put the mic there. Let's look for a good song. What would be a good piece for you... For a start, let's look for a good song. This is a very nice song. Are you familiar with this song? Let's try it. Okay. Lupe? I'll be staying over there. Okay?

You're still the star for our Friday and Saturday nights. Keep on practicing, dear. Yes. Tony will take care of you. And if possible, let's see what we can do. Tony? Why don't you let her sing tonight? For practice. Thank you very much, boss. Louie, I know you. - Okay. - You're starting again. See that? Just don't mind Ruffy. She's just insecure. Boss Louie is okay. Ruffy is his mistress, but he's a very smart business man. Can you do it tonight? I'll try. - I don't want my hair to be like that. - Rex? Why won't you like it? Rex, just a minute. Hi. She's Lupe. Hello. She's our new singer. And she would be singing tonight. Fix her up. - It's all up to you. - For you Tony, alright. Lupe, after that, we'll practice again, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay, bye Tony. - I'll see you later. - Thanks. - Get up, get up. Pay me later, okay? What would you wear?

Wait. - Bunny, come on let's play. - Let's go, Kadyo. - Take a bath. - I'm so excited for you. Come on, take a bath! You stink! - Why do I have to? - Come on, so you'd smell better. I need to take a bath? Of course! Come on, come on. Come on. There. Come on. - Let's do it. - Where have you been? You smell so bad. What smell? Before, whatever my smell was, it's fine with you. Of course, we need to smell good sometimes. - You're such a snob now. - You can't always be like that. Come inside. Come on. Let's do it. Wait a minute. Wait. Stay there.

Tony even told Carding. The waiter! But he wasn't able to talk to you. Carding? Yes. But... He didn't say anything to me. My God. He was so annoyed with Ruffy. That flirt, Ruffy, who didn't do anything else except get high and drunk. Friend, I think he wants to make you a regular singer at the night club. Regular singer? Lupe, did you hear that?

I was scared of confessing. But you know that. Even when we were in school then. If you really love me, you'd help me get out of our place.

Animal! Demon! Animal! Coward! Animal! You mean... Something happened to you? I'm preganant, mother. I wanted to give you. But the account is closed. Lupe paid for all your credit with Kadyo. Really? And Lupe said, that if you ask for credit again, she won't pay for it anymore. Let's see when Kadyo finds out about this. - Good for her she got karma. - One big Silver Swan. And... Garlic, two cloves. And one piece of laundry soap. And I would pay for our credit, with my mother. How much? Who would your child look like? But... Is Greco the one who got you pregnant? Are you sure? What's it to you? What? Nothing. It's just so hard for a single mother, to marry a single man. Don't mind her. She's crazy. Have you been to a doctor? You should do that. Your condition is sensitive. Especially that you work late at night. It may be bad for the child. I want to have this aborted. My God, Lupe, don't talk like that. That's a sin. I didn't want this, Luming. This child would only be a nuisance in my life. I was already doing better, but this came. I need to have this removed. Do you know? Guadalupe... It's Metring's fault. Ever since she lived with Kadyo, got bad luck. Their lives' a mess. Even Guadalupe was affected. And the worst is, the rumor mongers are spreading, it may not only be Greco, who raped her. They're sure that even his uncle Kadyo did. These people are pathetic. Such a waste. And her luck has just started. What would happen if her belly gets bigger? She won't be able to sing at the club anymore. My goodness. She would go back to begging, and digging in the garbage. Kadyo? You startled me. You didn't come here for a long time. It's your daughter's fault. But I always look for you at your spot. We stopped begging. Lupe doesn't want to do it anymore. Of course. You know, I heard some news. You're rich now. Not really. Kadyo, come on. And I also heard that, you'd be leaving this shanty. You have curtains now. Look at your progress. Your walls are plywood. You're really progressing. I also heard that the reason for you leaving this place, because you'd get your daughter marry Greco. Have pity on Lupe. I know that man all to well. For sure, everything, that Lupe would earn, would be sucked out by him like a leech. I think, if there's someone who should benefit, from what your daughter is earning, would be no one else but us. Instead of other people, just like that bastard man. Maybe you have saved a lot of money now. You know, Metring. I'm only asking for, to have a little. Just a tip. Kadyo? I don't have money. It's Lupe. She's the one with the money. Your selfish child. She told Luming not to let me have credit at the store. Where does Lupe keep her money? Where? I don't know, Kadyo. You don't know? Kadyo, don't! Please! Lupe saved that. Kadyo! Lupe worked hard for that. Have pity. Kadyo! Lupe saved that. My God. Here it is. Kadyo! Don't Kadyo! That's Lupe's money! Kadyo! Kadyo, have pity! Your daughter is so selfish. Kadyo! - Kadyo, don't touch that! - Here it is! Don't! Lupe saved that! - She's saving that. - Get away! - Have pity! - Stop it! Mother?! Mother! Mother? Mother? What's the meaning of this? Why? It's uncle Kadyo, right? Uncle Kadyo came here? Why did he get the money I saved?! I'm sorry, Lupe. Sorry? It's too much, mother. It's too much! Lupe! Lupe, what are you going to do? Lupe! Where are you going? Lupe! Come back here! Lupe, why? Where's uncle Kadyo? Where? He just left with Bunny. Lupe? Lupe? Ma'am Memay? I'm coming! Wait! Who is it? Wait! I'm here! It's the rich woman! Why? Where's uncle Kadyo? Where's uncle Kadyo? Do you know what time it is? I can get the police to arrest you! Open this door! - Open it! - Here, here. - Here, come in. - I'll break this down! There. Hey, hey! Where are you going? The tail of a sting ray! Kadyo! Why? Where's my money? What money? You know what money! The money I saved! It's mine! It's yours. Why are you asking it from me? What do you think of me? A thief? Liar! Give me my money! Give it to me! The money's not with me! Give it to me! Ouch! - Where's my money?! - I don't have the money! Animal! Animal! - That's enough! - Thief! That's enough! Lupe! Thief! Lupe! That's enough! That's enough! - Give me back my money! - Stop it! Here it is! I'll give it. There! Where's the rest?! I lost. You lost! Hey! I don't want to see you at home! I'll kill you! I'll never leave. Mother! He's cheating right in front of you! Your body is broken into pieces. Even your soul, is all broken too. Don't you love yourself anymore? Me? How about me, mother? Don't I mean anything to you? I want to leave this place. Please have pity, mother. Mother? Carding, come in. Have a seat. Thank you. I'll just get Lupe. Lupe? Lupe, what's that? What are you drinking? Lupe, what are you drinking? - Give it to me! - Let me... - Give it to me! - Let me do this! Let me drink this! Lupe? Lupe, this is a sin to God. Why? I don't want this child, Luming. It would tie me down here. Why would you blame the child? Your child doesn't have anything to do with what happened to you. What does this mean to you? Why do you care? Is this your child? Why? I've noticed that you're sad. Do you have a problem? This is the last time I'd sing here, Tony. What? Why? I'll just go straight to the point, I owe you a lot and you're so kind to me. I'm pregnant, Tony. I thought you were single? Before. But now, a single mother. So you're getting married? To whom? Who? I don't even know who's responsible for this. I'm sorry. But your belly isn't noticeable yet. You can still do this. How about Ruffy? You can bring her back. She needs work. Ruffy's vice became worse. And the management doesn't want her anymore.

Pack your things. You're coming with me. You're moving to our place. I'll give your child a name. I'll marry you. What has gotten into your head? Are you crazy? I'm thinking straight. Very straight. Lupe, I love you. You know that, way back then. A long time ago. I never loved anyone else except you. And sometimes, I had the guts to tell you that, but you said, my love has greed in it. I didn't force my love for you then. Because I know you have the ambition to marry someone rich. And I can't promise any kind of life for you. I'm also poor. But now, Lupe... I don't care with whatever you'd say. I'm not ashamed and scared, whatever you say or every one else! The only thing I know is, I love you. And I can't lose you. I need you, Lupe. And your child needs me too. Tell me. You need me too. Mother? Lupe and I are... I know. You brought home Lupe here, that means, she'd be your wife. No. We're going to be together for the child. We'll eventually decide on getting married. We haven't agreed on anything about that yet. Lupe? We're all poor. From now on, this house is yours too. Thank you. Don't worry about your mother. I'll take care of her. I'll visit her. And give her some money. Maybe working a bit on it, my earnings would be enough for us. Maybe the reason why she doesn't want to come with you, she doesn't want to be a burden to you. Especially now. Carding? People will laugh at you with what you're doing. Let them. Don't worry. I'll respect you. The important thing is, you're here. And your child. Our child. So I could take care of you. Carding?

Boss, it's Lupe. Come in, Lupe. Okay, thank you. Bye. Lupe? I want you to meet Don Ignacio Aboitiz Junior. - He's the owner of Golden Records. - Good evening. Congratulations, miss Velez. I enjoyed your singing very much. Thank you. You can be a recording star. The quality of your voice is exceptional. And very powerful. If you'd agree, I'm offering you a contract. You don't need to answer right away. Think about it carefully. Or... We can talk about it over dinner? I didn't wait for you earlier. It looked like you were talking about something important. Who was it? It's Don Ignacio Aboitiz. The owner of Golden Records. He was asking me to be a recording star. You accepted his offer? We still have to talk. But you'll accept it? We're still going to talk about it. I think those flowers are coming in everyday now. Let's start. Are you okay with it? Yes. Okay. One, two... Why? You're kind of sad? Nothing. I was just thinking, I'm so lucky. I think I'm rehearsing with the next star of Golden Records. Tony, I don't like that kind of joke. You mean, you're not going to accept Don Ignacio if he courts you? You're the one teaching me everything. Teach me how to answer that. For me, everything that could help you, I won't be in the way. I only want the best for you, Lupe. Once is enough for me. I've helped you to have a better life. ♪ Why do birds ♪ ♪ Suddenly appear ♪ ♪ Every time ♪ ♪ You are near ♪ ♪ Just like me ♪ ♪ They long to be ♪ ♪ Closer ♪ ♪ Closer ♪ ♪ To you ♪ ♪ Why do birds suddenly appear ♪ ♪ Every time you are near? ♪ ♪ Just like me, they long to be ♪ ♪ Close to you ♪ ♪ Why do stars fall down from the sky ♪ ♪ Each and very time you walk by? ♪ Get a lawyer. Consult him about this contract. But I assure you Lupe that, I'm giving you the best deal. It's a five-year contract. We'll build you up as a star. But we're giving you an option, to continue or discontinue the terms every year. Depending on your evaluation, of how we run your career. You'd do recording. With Tony. We'll give you the best arrangers, everything. For an "L.P." that we'll be launching, in one of your big concerts. You'll have the best people in the business. Marketing, promotions, publicity, concerts, recording, then television. And who knows? Maybe... later the movies. It's like it's unbelievable, Don Igancio. Call me Jun. Don't feel awkward if I already have white hair. I assure you, in many respects. I can be as young as anybody. Jun? Okay, Jun. I can't believe it. I don't know what to say. Good. I have one more contract. This has even better terms. This time, It's not a lawyer you need to ask. You have to ask your... Mind... And most especially your heart. It's a marriage contract. The terms are life long. Not as a recording star. But as a star. My only star. My wife. Are you kidding? No. Just persistent. Look, Lupe. I'm not young anymore. And I have realized that, I don't want to get old, that records is who I am going to be with. This time, I want a singer. Not just the song. That's why I'm going straight to the point, I want to marry you. It's not hard to like you, Jun. But I can't be sure if, I like you or... No problem. I don't have the illusion for you to like or love me, just because I offered you a contract. You can learn how to love. In time, you will learn to like me. And even love me. That's not the problem. You don't fully know me. That's not true. I hate to admit this but, I know who you are. Where you came from. When you were begging. When you dug in the garbage dump. Your mother, everything. But you made me admire you more with your determination to to get out where you came from. But all of that is in the past now. The important thing is now. There's one thing that your investigator didn't find out. Your child? I know about that too. I know you're with someone now. But you're not married. Which means that... You're free to decide. I want to give your child a new name. I want you and your child to have a better future. As a start, I'll get you a new house. And everything you need. You're not asleep yet? It's four in the morning. Can we talk? If it's about Don Ignacio, he offered me to be a contract star of Golden Records. And what's he asking in return? You have a filthy mind! So it's filthy! Isn't it you were the one who said that when you meet a rich man, and he offers you marriage, you won't have second thoughts? You'd do everything, just to get out of this place. Did he ask you to marry him? Or he'd make you a mistress? He offered me to marry him! And I'll marry him! Yes, you're right. I've never dreamt of anything else except to get out of this place! And now that a chance has come, nobody can stop me. Carding! Carding, stop it! Carding, stop! Carding! Carding! Stop it! Go on! Don't make me loathe you, Carding! You won't take him. You'll leave this house alone. He's my son. He's not your son. He's my child! I'm taking my child with me! - Give me my son! - You will not take him! Give my child to me! Give me my child! Get out! I'll leave now. But I'm coming back to get him. He won't grow up here! You don't have a right with because he's not your son! Don't worry. I've asked my lawyer to take care of everything. You were right. He doesn't have the rights... With you and the child. Firstly, you're not married. Secondly, he's not the father of the child. In court, and in front of God, he doesn't have any right at all. Jun? I want to get my mother. Get away, get away! Go on, go on there. I never sold myself. I'm not doing anything that I should be ashamed of. The new house where Lupe moved into, has no exchange like with what you're thinking. The luxury that she has now, is because she's a contract star of our company. And being a contract star, it's just right for her to have a bit of representation. Mother? Come with me. It's finished. Our misery has ended, mother. Let's leave this place. I implore you, mother. Begging. Mother? - Miss Lupe Velez. - Hello. Hi. Thank you. Hello, good evening, my wife's here. Hello. - Hi. - Good evening. Is this all you're having? How about some drinks? Waiter! Yes, sir? Waiter, take care of them, and ask them what more they want. Yes, sir. I'll leave them to you. Yes, sir. Okay, excuse us. What are your drinks? Gin tonic. Jun? Excuse me, just a minute. Why? Where are you going? Just a minute. See? Like I told you. Why don't you come to my office tomorrow? I'll be expecting you. Lupe, why? Rex? It's Carding. What is he doing here? What else? Being a waiter. What? Why? What? - My God... - Rex? The club is catering the party. Rex? Lupe?

If she finds out I allowed you to come in... So let's not tell her then! So I'd be left on the floor? And you're on a soft bed? What do you really want? Nothing. Is it bad to visit you? Metring? Up to now you're still angry with me? I should be the one angry with you. Maybe you're thinking I've forgotten what your daughter did to me? Kadyo? Let's stop the chaos and fighting. Lupe is living in peace now. Her life is getting better. I don't want to be the reason in ruining everything she planned for. Why would I ruin your plans? What do you think of me? Like rust? It's better that she succeeded, so we would be too. Let's not make her life hard again. Am I making any trouble? If it's money you need, I'll give it to you. Lupe has been giving me. Regular? Okay.
