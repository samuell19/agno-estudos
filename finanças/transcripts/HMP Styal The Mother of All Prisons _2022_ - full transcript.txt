Tucked away in the countryside near the posh suburbs of Manchester is one of Britain's most notorious places... If you visit Styal, it's something of a shock. ..HMP Styal. A prison which may look like a village...but it's far from it. I would say that Styal prison was probably the most challenging place that I have ever worked. Here, you'll join the worst women in Britain. The real bad girls. There's a lot of murderers, child killers, paedophiles. You'd be living alongside mothers who kill their own children. Here's a place in which some monsters lie. One person I was on the wing with, Rachel Tunstill, she'd killed her own child and put it in the bin. You'll be on a wind full of drug dealers and drug addicts. Six months in, I started taking heroin. Once crack came into me life, I could never really leave it alone. You'll be in a cell next to inmates battling severe mental illness. I've seen women try and take their eyes out. They used to swallow razor blades, swallow batteries. You can be walking up the wing and all blood will be seeping under somebody's door. And you'll be confronted with more death than in any other female prison. She died in the care of the state. This is the inside story. Killing a child is not something that a prison inmate takes lightly. From those who are incarcerated... A couple of people I've known have got done with hot boiling water and sugar. ..those who work here... Your main concern is, keep that woman alive. Do whatever you can do to keep her alive. ..and those who want some answers. I just don't understand it. Why? Do they not matter cos they're criminals? Just tell us the truth. Welcome to the mother of all prisons. Home to around 400 female convicted criminals, this is HMP Styal. Located just outside Wilmslow in Cheshire, this is a prison like no other. Styal is, what I would say, a unique prison in terms of its layout. We had cellular accommodation, what we called Waite wing, but then, we had a lot of open accommodation on the house units. If you visit Styal, it's something of a shock. Because it looks, for all the world, like a housing estate. Except it's got this big metal fence around it. The houses are large, detached Victorian houses. Got beautiful gardens. You've got the woodlands surrounding. There are little tree-lined walkways. It's a village. It's a tiny little... Lots of village greens, in a way, between the blocks. I remember a prisoner coming from Durham. When she came to Styal, she got down onto the grass to stroke it, to kiss it. And she actually asked the question, is it real? People think of a prison, they think of it as big, bleak, and behind huge fences. Styal isn't really like that. It looks a bit more like Butlins. But Styal's reputation precedes it. And new inmates will start to hear rumours within minutes of arriving. It is a place in which some monsters lie. Some of Styal's notorious inmates include Farzana Ahmed, who, along with her husband, suffocated to death their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to accept a forced marriage in Pakistan. Tracie Andrews, who famously stabbed and killed her fiance Lee and attempted to persuade the world that it was a road-rage attack. Tracey Connelly, a mother who caused or allowed the murder of her toddler, Baby P, in a case that horrified the nation. And most recently, one of the most hated female killers in British criminal history, Savannah Brockhill, who beat to death 16-month-old Star Hobson. But you don't have to be a murderer to end up at Styal prison. Only about 15% of the inmates of Styal have committed violent offences. They are not all murderers, or indeed, murderers of their children. The majority of women in Styal are actually minor offenders. Because unlike male prisons, Styal does not distinguish between a Category A prisoner and a completely, in a way, not very significant crime. They're all lumped into one. You've got anything from people that have committed the worst offences, all the way to shoplifters, habitual drug users, sex workers. The reason they're lumped together is that only 4% of the entire prison population in the United Kingdom is women. And so, there aren't enough to justify separate institutions, looking at less significant offenders against very significant offenders. It's easier, and also, probably, more financially sensible, to put them together. Whatever your crime at Styal, you'll be processed in the same way when you arrive. A female prisoner will arrive in reception. You'll get patted down for drugs and weapons and whatnot, and you have to sit on... It's called a boss chair. The boss chair, which is a body-orifice security scanner... It checks to see if you've got anything inserted. Any metal, anything like that. And then, she begins the processing. Take her photograph, her height. You'll be given clothes that other inmates have left behind. I know that one of the governors goes to Primark every month and buys a load of leggings, a load of tops and a load of shoes. And you'll be given them. If they haven't got them, you'll be given second-hand stuff. And then, when they've finished with her, she'll go to what's called the first-night centre. And then, you're in their hands, then. If you think about walking into prison for the first time, you know, it must be quite shocking. Because all of your rights are stripped away at that door immediately. You know, you can't open a door without somebody, you can't go to the toilet without being let through, you can't eat at a certain... Whenever you want, you know. So everything... And that is the punishment, is losing your freedom. After your first night at Styal, you're ready for your first day. If you move into one of its 16 communal houses, you'll live like a family, with women who've committed a range of crimes. You could even end up sharing a bedroom with a murderer or paedophile. The houses are self-contained units. There'd be a kitchen and a living room, and then sort of dormitory-style accommodation. The door would be unlocked in the day, women could come and go to and from work on their own, and they would have freedom to wander around at night-time, as well. You've got people who volunteer themselves to do the servery, who are in charge of cleaning up. You've got to work together to make the house work, obviously, but sometimes, it just doesn't work. The house units definitely promoted a sense of community, but it's in-your-face communal living. I hated the house experience. There's about 17 girls to a house. It's completely bitchy. Sometimes there's a lot of bullying going on. Sometimes you get people who think they're the top dog of the house, they own it. The gossip and the backbiting, and the "who's done this" and "who's done that", and the arguments over drugs. Mostly, it's all words, it's all threats getting shouted across, but it does come up to fights. Women, by their very nature, and much more hormonal than men. We all know, you know, the time of the month. And if you've got sort of 90 women all at the same time, then, um...you know, it can be a little bit fraught. They're much more likely to lash out quickly. So they can be rather sort of unpredictable to manage. I would say that Styal prison was probably THE most challenging place that I have ever worked. In terms of the complexity, the incidence of violence, self-harm, the emotional distress that goes along with, um...dealing with the women. I would say they're prone to more violence, whether it be between each other or on themselves. As your first full day ends at Styal, you'll learn that some inmates who've committed the most hideous crimes are often separated from the rest of the prisoners for their own protection. I've seen women on the wing being assaulted. A couple of people have got done with hot boiling water and sugar. There is a prisoner code, and they are seen as the lowest of the low. Most inmates at Styal live in the communal houses, but if you are a high-profile offender, you'll be sent to a unit for prisoners who require stricter supervision - Waite wing. It's basically a big wing. Two levels. There's about 80 cells on each side. It was a 23-hour bang-up. You could get out for an hour association at night, and that's when everybody did what they needed to do, shower, make a phone call, and that's it. It's a dive, cos obviously, there's a lot of women who are coming in who are detoxing, there's women with mental health problems, and there's a lot of paedophiles, there's a lot of murderers, child killers. The state of affairs on the wing itself was just disgraceful. I mean, mattresses full of blood. I caught scabies off the mattress. Um...there was nit combs in the shower full of nits. I mean, it was the dirtiest, disgusting... That's how it was back then. I mean, people would be walking down the landing and throwing up cos they were rattling. Waite wing houses women who've committed the most heinous crime of all - killing a child. It's where one of the prison system's most-despised inmates recently started her 25-year life sentence for murder. Savannah Brockhill is a former bouncer, security guard, boxer, who formed a relationship with a younger woman called Frankie Smith. And Frankie Smith had a daughter called Star. Savannah Brockhill described herself once, memorably, as "number one psycho". And she had a habit of threatening to kill almost anyone. And she beat up Frankie Smith on an absolutely regular basis. Brockhill lost her temper relentlessly, and eventually started to take it out on this 16-month-old little girl called Star Hobson. Finally, killing her by what the judge later described as a kick or a punch equivalent to a high-speed car crash. It was also discovered the little 16-month-old had earlier injuries, including a broken ankle. Brockhill took some pleasure in her notoriety. She positively preened in the dock. She loved being a psycho. And finally, Brockhill was convicted of the murderer of Star Hobson. And when she went to Styal, she was segregated. At Styal, high-profile killers like Brockville are kept apart from the rest of the inmates, for their own protection. Anybody coming into prison who had murdered young children are treated very badly. That is the worst crime that can possibly be committed. And female prisoners just do not tolerate it. There is a prisoner code, and they are seen as the lowest of the low, and they are a target. Especially child killers like Savannah Brockhill, what she would cop for if she came off that seg. In a phone call from inside prison, one inmate recounts how Styal's women reacted to killer Brockhill's recent arrival. There's a lot of women in there that can't see their children, that, you know, have lost their children because of things that have happened, and then were mixing with women who've killed children, or raped children. You know, it's not good. Especially with women, because they're so protective, as mums and stuff. I mean, there was one woman there who was in for... They had a dead baby's skeleton in the wardrobe. And they tried to put her once on a house that I was on, and she didn't last half an hour. She was off. Nobody would have it, you know. I mean, how can you have the skeleton of your baby in a wardrobe, found in a bag? Myra Hindley, at one point, there were rumours that Myra was going to come to Styal prison. And the anger within the prison that Myra might come, they were plotting what they would do to Myra. And so, they were watching daily to make sure Myra Hindley did not come into Styal. Despite efforts to segregate the most notorious prisoners, the rest of the inmates will always find a way to get at them. Especially if they've committed the worst crime of them all. I think they find the killing of a child by their mother even more horrifying. Somehow, matricide is the worst of all possible crimes. They should be there to protect and nurture, to treasure their children. And the fact that they choose to kill them is...beyond imagination. I was on there with Tracey Connelly, Baby P's mum. Loads of people are like, "What's she like? What's she like?" Cos obviously, she's...she's so well-known. Most of the time, we would get opened up before her and taken...let down for dinner. And then, we'd be banged up before she was let out. What they've done is so horrific that if you can terror them at any opportunity, you will. I've seen women on the wing being assaulted. They put cockroaches in their bed. Spitting in food is done quite a bit. It's just about finding the horriblest thing you could put into somebody's dinner. SHE LAUGHS A couple of people have got done with hot boiling water and sugar. One person I was on the wing with, Rachel Tunstill, she'd killed her own child, I think it was pretty soon after giving birth, in a toilet. I think she put it in a bin bag and put it in the bin. She got a hard time. 26-year-old Rachel Tunstill was a psychology graduate with a Masters in Forensic Psychology. She claimed she'd had a miscarriage, but was convicted of murder, having stabbed her newborn baby around 15 times with a set of scissors. So she's doing 17 years. But to look at her, she was just like a really quiet, frightened mouse who just looked so innocent and so naive and gullible and just not really cut out for prison whatsoever. I don't know, when you think of a child killer, you don't think of some quiet introvert, a person...not a confident person. So then, you've got to look and think, well, maybe there was something really that tipped her over the edge. Because her family have stood by her, and it's their grandchild that's been killed. So, you know, is there more to it? I know some of these women, as well, may have suffered with postnatal depression, and something may have pushed these women over the edge. So I did wonder about that, yeah, if that's...if she's been really, really mentally unwell. But, then it's...then you think, well, putting it in a bag and putting it in the bin like it is a piece of rubbish, is a really sinister and sick thing to do, so somewhere, you are deranged. One of the most extraordinary things about Styal is that women who've murdered babies or children are incarcerated in a prison where some convicted mothers are allowed to raise their own kids while serving time. Really, really juxtaposition, isn't it? The uniqueness of Styal is that you can have a child killer located on a unit not far away from, you know, a mother and baby unit. Styal is one of six prisons in the UK that has a unit dedicated to pregnant women and mothers who've recently given birth. I think the concept of a mother and baby unit to most people would seem really bizarre. And on the surface, it is bizarre, you know, to have a child in prison. However, the nature of women is that they get pregnant and they have children. And just because you're pregnant or you have children does not mean you haven't got an addiction problem or you haven't committed a crime. The mother and baby unit at Styal now houses mums and babies up to two years old. It's always full. And when Sue was sent to prison for drug-related offences in 2002, she could only hope she'd get a place. I was 17 weeks' pregnant when I arrived in Styal. I think the thought of going into labour on the wing terrified me. You know, just being in that cell, and, what a thing to have to say to me child when she's grown up, "Oh, yeah, you were born in a cell". She wasn't, she was born in a hospital. I eventually went on to the mother and baby unit. Quite a relaxed atmosphere. There's all sterilisers and stuff in the kitchen, then you've got your washroom. You know, it's not a cell door, it's a wooden door with a window in it. Settees downstairs with big scatter cushions and a big TV in a unit. And, obviously, prams are provided and stuff like that, so you can take them for a walk around the avenues and whatnot when you've had your child. Having seen the babies being walked around in buggies, me, personally, it's really difficult to wrap my head around seeing young children in prison. Cos it doesn't matter what you say, there's still a big gate, there's still a big wall, there's still a fence. You know, these children are in prison. Some people would say, well, mothers shouldn't be sent to prison. Babies shouldn't be in prison. Yes, I can see where people come from, because...the babies didn't see normal life. The babies at Styal then never saw men. They never heard traffic noise. They never saw animals. So it wasn't normal in that respect. But to know that the babies were well cared for, they were loved, I think it is actually a good service. They do have nannies that take the children for walks out the prison gates so that they can get used to sounds and cars and, you know, cos they don't hear things like dogs barking or anything like that. So they try and normalise it for the babies. I think it would probably affect the babies more if they were separated from their mother for the first 18 months of their life than if they spent the first 18 months of their life with them in a room in a prison. If you're on a mother and baby unit, that's an incredibly privileged place to be. There are very, very limited places at an absolute premium. So you agree to abide by a set of behavioural rules by being located on the mother and baby unit. If you got into trouble, they threatened to take your telly off you on the wing, and go on basic. But if you're pregnant, you're getting threatened to take the baby of you. If you've got a place on mother and baby unit and you put a foot out of place, the baby's going. I've known women who've had to hand babies out on visits. Like, passing the baby over the table like a cup of tea. Like all inmates at Styal, if you're caught breaking the rules inside the prison, you'll be punished. But if you toe the line, you'll be rewarded for good behaviour. Across all prisons, whether it's male or female, you have a privilege system. Basic, standard and enhanced. And every prisoner comes into prison on what we called standard regime. So that is a standard set of privileges. So that will determine how many visits they can have, certain access to jobs, how much they're allowed to spend in the canteen every week, how much private cash they're allowed. Wages are about £7.00. I think it's £12.50 of private cash that you get sent in. But if you work hard, if you conform to the rules and the regulations, you can be put forward to become an enhanced prisoner. They're out longer, they get more to spend in the canteen, they get an extra visit, they have their TV, they have a PlayStation. Quite hard to get on enhanced. Being on enhanced is, like, you are very good. Not so much as you kiss peoples arses, but you're more better at playing the system. At the bottom, you have basic regime. Basic is for the naughty girls. The ones that don't conform, who are always getting into trouble, who refuse to work. If they've been found with drugs on them, or mobiles, etc, they'd be put on basic. Lowest amount of cash, the lowest visiting orders, no TV, for example. They'd spent a lot of the time behind their door. Their whole sort of regime is restricted. But despite the risk of going on basic, inmates at Styal constantly break the rules, especially when it comes to contraband. Which is traded in secret and in ingenious ways. Even hidden in the tiniest hem of a jacket, there would be packets of cocaine, heroin, cannabis. People go as low as actually putting it in the babies' nappies. Every morning at Styal, whether on the wing or in the houses, you'll be woken up for breakfast at around 7am, before you begin a full day's work. The daily routine for an inmate at Styal would be unlock at about eight o'clock, then you'd start work at about 8:30. Convicted must work, so that's how they earn money. Jobs at Styal, you could do gardens, kitchens, cleaners, wing cleaners, house cleaners. The best jobs to get would be orderly jobs. You could clean the governor's corridor. That would be an orderly job. Because it would make you more chances of getting on enhanced. Going to work at Styal not only offers you regular income, it gives you and other inmates prime opportunity to put your earnings to good use. When they go to work, or coming back from work, there would be officers lining the route to watch for the passing. Cigarettes, tobacco, drugs. Because this is the opportunity, when they're mixing with the different prisoners from different units, to exchange things. Free flow is when unlocked to work, and you've got, like, basically, 15 minutes to get to your workplace. And in that 15 minutes, you've either got to go and meet who you're getting your tablets or drugs off. So you pretty much have to get all your wheeling and dealing done. I know people are amazed at how drugs get in. You know, I spent 27, 28 years trying to fight drugs from coming into jails. But as soon as you shut one door, you know, another one opens. Drugs coming into the prison was almost on a daily basis. It is a constant battle. But when you think that drugs inside a jail are worth three, four times what they're worth outside. So it's big business for somebody inside, for sure. If somebody is going to court tomorrow, they will swallow the drugs today. In a condom, clingfilm, balloon or whatever, and pass it in prison. It was quite common for drugs to be passed on visits. There was numerous occasions where drugs were hidden in babies' cribs, you know, in carrycots and things. People go as low as actually putting it in the babies' nappies. Even hidden in the tiniest hem of a jacket, they would be packets of cocaine, heroin, cannabis. I can remember one female prisoner whose mother used to send her flowers in with drugs in the stems of the flowers. One of the latest things is spraying drugs on to pages in books so that they can sniff it. I've seen drugs in dead pigeons. Oranges injected with drugs, tennis balls filled with... Polo mints with the drugs poked down the hole. One woman on visits had a little bit of... like a fishing nylon tied to her front teeth. And as she pulled it up, all these drugs came from her stomach. You know, unreal. Unbelievable. But there is one method above all others that women use to smuggle in drugs without getting caught. It's known by the inmates as crotching. Crotching is quite a common way for women to bring drugs in. They will hide it in the vagina, and they will bring it in in that way. It wasn't uncommon for the women that were serving shorter sentences to get out, they could be returning back in three or four weeks, and they would come in with drugs secreted on them. You know, you can't perform internal searches on women. I've crotched drugs before, yeah, but in case they take you for a strip-search. So if you had pills, like, Valium tablets, or, you know, foil or lighters. I once knew a girl to crotch a mobile phone and a charger. So, yes. Some women are well-known for being the jail's drug dealers. I know one lady that gets out, plugs up straight away, cos she knows she's going to come back in again. So she'll come back in with ounces of spice, ounces of heroin, and supplying the wing for weeks on end. God, I've known women who come in with stuff inserted and they've still got stuff three months later. They've brought that much stuff in. One girl can store like a chipmunk, seriously. She does it every time she's in. When people see her, they're made up. Like Sue, the majority of inmates who arrive at Styal are already addicted to drugs. I was just addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. I was prescribed methadone. And once crack came into me life when I was 26, I could never really find the strength to put it down and leave it alone. I have to always go back to it. And, you know, that was really hard to overcome. Many others at Styal become addicted to drugs once inside. Former inmate Brenda had never touched them before starting her life sentence for murder. I went in prison when I was 17. And because I was kind of naive to the situation, I didn't know what was going on, six months in, I started taking heroin. I remember first taking heroin in a roll-up. Someone made it for me. And I will always hate that person for giving me me first taste of heroin, because they shouldn't have, but at the time, I did mither them, so really, I can't blame them. But it just took everything away, even if it was just a few hours. It made me sick, but it was nice. I wanted it as much as I could. Yeah, some women are worse than others for running around, trying to get drugs. One time, somebody threw themselves off the twos years ago because she couldn't get a wrap. That's, you know, the extent some women will go to for drugs. Because there's nothing else for them to do. I would say that drugs are certainly one of the most prevalent issues within a female prison. I've come across cannabis, cocaine, heroin, spice, LSD, the little smiley face stickers. You name it, probably I've seen it. At my time at Styal, it was predominantly heroin that was being used and coming through. Crack cocaine used to come through quite often, as well. And that was the sort of one we were always worried about, cos that tended to sort of ramp up the behaviour, ramp up the aggression, you know, and it would cause fights within the prison. You know, who was going to get it, who owed who what. And it was, you know, a dog-eat-dog sort of world. With addiction rife inside Styal, drugs are in high demand, and they're valuable. So there will always be the potential for violence. It was the cause of quite some quite really serious, nasty assaults. You know, if a woman was believed to have come in with drugs secreted inside her, it wasn't unheard of for other prisoners to pin her down and internally search her and retrieve those drugs. They called it decrotching, which is quite a brutal term, but it was quite a brutal thing to do. One time, a girl got decrotched in Styal on the wing by a couple of women. They basically held her down, um...I believe four of them, and one of them put a rubber glove on and put her hand inside her privates and got the drugs out herself, where she'd crotched them. I believe it ended up in somebody getting done, or nearly getting charged with rape. There was... You know, occasionally, implements would be used. Spoons, forks, anything, to sort of retrieve those drugs from inside the person. So, you know, dealing... dealing with those women afterwards was quite...quite challenging. The prevalence of drug use inside Styal might not be so surprising when you consider the make-up of the majority of the prison's population. You're dealing with really damaged individuals, you know, that have had really tragic lives and really difficult circumstances. A lot of them have been abused, whether sexually or physically, mentally. A lot of them have come from broken homes. Unstable lifestyle. It's that chaotic lifestyle that seemed to be quite prevalent amongst the population. And as I said, you know, mental health, drug use, the two together are an absolute recipe for disaster. The vast majority of the women at Styal are suffering from some form of mental illness, and this is the cause of another of the prison's most serious problems. There is a very significant statistic that stuck in my mind about Styal. There have been 735 incidents of self-harm in the six months leading up to March 2018. That's an average of 125 self-harming incidents a month. When I got to Styal, I was absolutely shocked at the level and the severity of the self-harm. We're talking, you know, women that would hang themselves to the point of, you know, nearly dead. Women that would, you know, slice open the veins in their arms, or cut their neck, or cut their face. There was one woman who used to insert plastic cutlery. She had an open hole in his stomach that she used to insert plastic cutlery in. They used to swallow razor blades, swallow batteries. And this was day in, day out. It's constant. You can be walking up the wing and all blood will be seeping under somebody's door onto the wing, where they've cut themselves to smithereens. And then they'll come out on the wing and they'll have been bandaged up and it's like a competition, who's got the deepest cuts and the most cuts? And it's pretty much everywhere, that. Most females who come into prison who self-harm, they often find it a way of release. To release the tension, to release the pressure, to make them feel better. And, um... So they've used it outside, if they're sort of a prostitute or they're being abused, or... It's a coping mechanism. I've seen women try and take their eyes out, I've seen them literally bite a chunk in their wrist down to the bone and spit out the piece of flesh. You know, there are some serious, um... disturbed and troubled women that end up in prison. Really, you need to a wing dedicated to them kinds of people who are self-harming and who aren't well. There's a lot of women in Styal with mental health problems that really shouldn't be in that environment. Locking up the alarming numbers of mentally-unwell inmates is a huge challenge for Styal, and it's the reason behind a dark secret which has haunted the prison for years. I heard the alarm. Cos my cell was so near...next to the seg, I heard an officer slapping Sarah, trying to wake her up. They said if they'd got her straight to the hospital, they could have saved her. And they didn't. Each step along the way, they failed her. Do they not matter cos they're criminals? Over the last 20 years, HMP Styal has been known for an unprecedented number of deaths behind its bars. In the early 2000s, Styal got a reputation for being the suicide capital of the British prison population. In a very few months, there were six suicides. An astonishing number for one prison. Part of the reason was that the prison was being asked to cope with the mentally unstable, deeply troubled. I remember the first suicide that happened when I was on Waite wing. Sarah Campbell. Perhaps the most famous case of all was the death of an 18-year-old from Malpas in Cheshire on only the second night of her sentence at Styal. It would be fair to say that Sarah Campbell had a troubled life. She descended into the use of drugs, and finally, the age of 18, fate led her to harass a man in the street. Demanding money that she could use to pay for drugs. Unfortunately, the man she harassed was comparatively elderly. After being approached by Sarah, the man suffered a heart attack and died. Sarah was charged with manslaughter. She had the blondest hair. She was so shy and timid, introverted, like. You could just tell by looking at Sarah about her state of mind. She had such bad scar marks, self-harm marks on her arms. Like, she definitely shouldn't have been there. She had all the classic characteristics of a Styal inmate. She was young, troubled, with drug problems, mental health problems, and had fallen into this pit of horror. We thought she was going into a... ..psychiatric unit at Styal, but apparently, it only... SHE SIGHS ..it only held eight people, and it was full! Sarah was really upset because she realised she wasn't going to go into a psychiatric unit. She was banging her head on the wall, and so, they decided that they would put her in the segregation block. I heard the alarm. Cos my cell was so near the...next to the seg, I heard an officer slapping Sarah, trying to wake her up. Slapping her so hard that I heard the slaps. She must have taken...drugs. And they took off to Manchester hospital. She was dying of the pills, you see. She was shouting for help. She wanted help! She took them and then she asked for help. And somebody must have gone. Anyway, the ambulance was... Because they said if they'd got her straight to the hospital, they could have saved her. And they didn't. Eventually, there was an inquest into Sarah's death, and Styal was held to account. The inquest was two years after Sarah died. And the verdict wasn't that she'd committed suicide, she'd died in the care of the state. And it was the jury, really, that brought that about. A similar thing happened a few years later in 2008, when a young woman called Lisa Marley, on remand for assault, also died in her cell at Styal. As a young woman, she had mental health problems and she got involved with drugs at an early age. She once said to me that heroin made her forget, um... and it was the only thing that ever made her forget. The worst possible thing for her was to be sat in a room on her own, hours and hours and hours, with her own thoughts. I think that's probably what led her to do, um...what she did. Because it's clear from her prison diary that she was struggling. She was really, really frightened about being sentenced. They took her to the mental health part of the prison and put her in the safest cell in the prison, apparently, which obviously wasn't. The next day, she didn't want to come out of her cell. She kept telling them, "I won't be here, I won't be here". And they didn't even ask the mental health nurse to talk to her or anything. Just nothing. The inquest into Lisa Marley's death also ruled that Styal prison had failed her. Lisa was on suicide watch. You could clearly see on the CCTV that one of the officers went to visit her at 12:10, couldn't see her, admitted that she couldn't see her. And in that incident, as far as I'm aware, the protocol is to go and get somebody else, go back to the cell and get into the cell. Nobody went back to that cell for 20 minutes. Why? It's just let down all the way through, you know. I mean, you just keep hearing of it again and again and again. When's it going to end, you know? There can be no question that Styal is asked to deal with exceptionally vulnerable, disturbed young women. But it would also be fair to say that... the prison has failed on more than one occasion to offer its inmates the care that they should deserve. Holly Daglish was a prison officer at Styal for eight years. She doesn't accept that staff weren't trying to help these women. It's difficult because every suicide is tragic, but I don't want people to think that staff weren't trying their absolute best for these women. I'll give you one example. One weekend we worked, and there was, from the Friday night to the Monday morning, 90 incidents of self-harm. 90! That's like... Whether it be self-harm or attempted suicide. So ligaturing was very common, self-strangulation was very common. And, you know, we were quite often running from one incident to the other, to the other. You could have spent, you know... ..five hours in a cell with Donna, talking to her, trying to get her not to kill herself, not to self-harm, to... you know, try and resolve her issues, but you've got 14 other women that still need your attention. There was one case where a woman... She'd hung herself from a light fitting, and... But she'd also cut her face and cut her throat, as well. So me and another officer went in and lifted her up. And as we lifted her up, all her bodily fluids, um... let loose, shall we say. And we were covered in blood, excrement, urine. And we were still there, we were still trying to save her life, we were still lifting her up. You know, we didn't know where she was bleeding from, we didn't know how long she'd been hanging, but we were there, you know, we were there, literally rolling around in it, trying to save this woman's life. And you literally don't think about yourself. Your main concern is, keep that woman alive. Do whatever you can do to keep her alive. SIREN WAILS And I genuinely believe for every one, as tragic as they were, there is 100 more saved. Because we had so many close calls. So, so many close calls, um...you know. But that never got recognised. But for many, the real issue is that prisons like Styal are not the right places to send women who are mentally unwell. The officers, they're not mental health nurses. There's not enough mental health support. We were very undertrained to deal with what we were dealing with. We just had to deal with what we were presented with on a daily basis, and...and... Whether that be self-harm, or violence or whatever, um... But, yeah, really, really challenging, difficult, complex, you know, mental health issues. We are asking Styal to do things that it's not equipped to do, we're asking Styal to do it without a budget to do it effectively. And indeed, they didn't have the infrastructure to offer them the right help, the right therapy. Each year, there are many deaths in British prisons, but what brought Styal into the spotlight was the fight of Sarah Campbell's mother Pauline... ..who believed the prison had killed her daughter. The prison had a legal duty of care to look after Sarah. I don't think her health problems were addressed adequately whilst she was in prison. It is, after all, a prison, and not a hospital. I don't think prisons are equipped to deal with people who have mental ill-health problems. Pauline couldn't forgive them. And she couldn't forgive them because five other women had died, as well! She was just as angry about that. That women were dying. It wasn't safe. It isn't safe for women in prison. It isn't a safe place to send them! I'll never forget her mum going round every single prison. Every time there was a suicide, she'd be there with a picket outside saying, "Stop it! Stop the Suicides! Help the Vulnerable!" That women shouldn't be held in places such as Styal when they were so vulnerable and were so much self-harming. She was, in fact, arrested 15 times for demonstrating outside prisons. And it made the rage against Styal even more intense. In the end, Pauline's persistence seemed to pay off. In the wake of Sarah Campbell's death and her mother's campaign, the government commissioned a report and suggested a whole string of improvements, including smaller units, better care, better staffing, better training. She was so thrilled with the Corston Report. She was so happy. But Pauline soon realised that despite her efforts, no changes were going to be made. When they started... ..to pick things out of the Corston Report, and Pauline... I mean, Pauline realised it wasn't going to be put. Remembered with love, Sarah Elizabeth Campbell. Aged 18. Died on 18th January, 2003. Her mother left broken-hearted. Pauline Campbell, aged 60 years, died 15th May, 2008. Now at rest. Five years after daughter Sarah died inside Styal prison, her mother Pauline gave up her fight. In the summer of 2008, Pauline Campbell committed suicide herself. Very close to her daughter's grave. If there is one great memory about what the dangers of Styal are, it is those two suicides of mother and daughter, Pauline and Sarah Campbell. Not killed by Styal, that wouldn't be fair, but certainly victims of the system that Styal represents. We're now 14 years later, and not a lot has really changed. The suicide rate at Styal is roughly one a year in the last five years. Still the same things are still happening. Now, we were assured when we were at Lisa's inquest that this was going to be recommended, that they had trained staff on the mental health unit. And as far as I'm aware, that's not happened. I just don't understand it. Why? Do they not matter cos they're criminals? Currently, there are about 350 inmates at Styal, and only around 40 or 50 women serving time for murder. The rest are mostly in for minor crimes caused by drugs and mental health issues. For them, Styal may represent a problem rather than a solution. Pauline was to say, and I think it's a wonderful quote, "Prisons, including Styal, "are a dumping ground for abused, oppressed "and desperate women "who need help, not punishment". The majority of crime committed by women is not violent crime. And therefore, we should be able to look at some other way of dealing with these mentally ill, distressed, abused women. I think the judges find it easier to send them to prison, and think, "Oh, it's not society's problem, let jail deal with it", you know. Because they're seen as a criminal. Judges sometimes have no option. You know, what do you do with a woman that has, you know, shoplifted the local Tesco's 70 times? I'm not sure that incarcerating somebody for a month, for six weeks, for, you know, three months, is any use nor ornament. What can you do in that time with that person? Can you get them off drugs? Unlikely. Will they stay off when they go out? Unlikely. Unfortunately, the kind of work that's needed with these women takes time, commitment, resources, money. And it's just not popular with the general public. You know, taxpayers' money going on, you know, helping women rehabilitate. It's not a vote-winner. I think society just needs to get its head round change and spend the money more wisely. And not look at nonviolent, short-sentence crimes as a rites to teach women a lesson. We, as a society, have never worked out what it is we want to do with female prisoners. We are incredibly ambivalent about it. Whether it's a sex worker, a drug addict, someone who's mildly involved in the drug trade, we don't know. We don't seem to distinguish. And that's what Styal crystallises. It's a fudge. Everything's just shoved together. We're asking Styal to look after things that we, as a society, don't want to think about. And that is not a criticism of Styal, that's a criticism of society for asking it to do things because we don't want to think about them.
