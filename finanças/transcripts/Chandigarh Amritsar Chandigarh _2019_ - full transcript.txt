Good morning. Aadaab, sat shri akal Amritsar.. ..you are listening 98.3 mirchi with RJ.parvez.. Tell me one thing.. How do you start your day? With Amritsari bread isn't it? Amazing! All you Amritsari people are really genuine.. They say that when you are in love, you'd do anything.. Well, you are in love with the food. Ok.. I am leaving you with some beautiful songs. "An angel from Chandigarh is here.." "An angel from Chandigarh is here.. she looks like a butterfly." "She is here to cause trouble.. Beautiful Jatti.." "Beautiful Jatti is here.. And she has already.." "And she has already mesmerised everyone.. Beautiful Jatti.." "Beautiful Jatti is here.." Turn around, girl. The boy's honking for you. This way, madam. Get on it. This way, this way, madam. Tell me, where do you want to go? - Move back! - Come on, man. She won't go with you. So you better leave. - Why? Why don't she go with us? - Move back! - Look at this, brother. - Sit here madam. They didn't even have a bath. Whereas I have even used a deodorant. I'll take your bags. You have a seat. Rubbish. - She is my passenger. - He always does this. - Whose bags are these? - They aren't yours? I didn't get any bags with me. - Brother! - Give my bags. - Sorry, sir. - Are you trying to steal them? No way, sir. I thought they belong to her. Where do you want to go? Guru Bazar. Guru Bazar? Come with me then. Please sit down. Madam, please move aside a little. He will give you company and me a chance to make 20 bucks. Excuse me! I wish to go alone. Do you want to take me there or shall I take another rickshaw? Sir, you should find another rickshaw. Take any you want. I don't want any problems this morning. Ok? Where do you want to go, madam? - Get out of here, I'll guide you. - Okay. "Beautiful Jatti is here.." "Her eyes are like diamonds and she shines like gold." "She has put perfume on her body" "She gets million-million likes, oh girl" "Her fan following is genuine, not fake" "She has finished her internet pack" "Beautiful Jatti.." "She passed through the market. Don't ask what happened next." "Danger started looming around." "The boys who followed here.." Yes, mom? - Reet, are you out somewhere? No, I am in office. Chandigarh.. - Why can I hear noises? - Mom, client's here. "The boys turned around out of fear." He doesn't know. Let's go. Madam, ask the boys who are playing over there. This match is going to have a nail biting finish. It's the tenth over. You stay away, mister. You stink, you haven't had a bath. We need 6 runs in 2 balls to win the match.. With the ball we have a poor substitute for Malinga. Bowler bowls.. Batsman hits it with his bat and the ball is going high up in the air.. The way the batsman is running, it looks like he shall soon cross the border. Monty and Shonty are ready to catch the ball. Both of them end up banging into each other just like the state buses. We need six runs in two balls to win the match! Excuse me? Out! What have you done? He got distracted. It's okay. He plays well. - Come on, it's my turn now. - Congratulations. He got out! He just played. Can you tell me where this place is? 36-24-36? Someone's residence coincides with Katrina Kaif's figure. Sorry, those are dress measurements. Just a minute. Here. This is the address. You are from Chandigarh? Yes, how do you know? You have an address written on a nightclub's card. Such advanced girls who visit nightclubs can only be from Chandigarh. Why? Don't girls over here go to nightclubs? Boys don't either here. - Why? - Culture. We party during daytime. Nonsense. That's why I don't like Amritsar. - Anyway.. - Why? What's wrong with Amritsar? It is such a beautiful city. People from across the world come here. True. Please, can you guide me to this place? The Chabutara lane? Not Chabutara.. Chowk Chabutara. Right, exactly. Can you tell me where it is? You will get lost in the lanes. Let me take you there. No, thank you. Please just guide me. - There are many dogs in those lanes. - Do they bite? Have you heard of dogs that kiss? It's their job to bite. Of course they will bite. Let me take you there. I'll manage. You just tell me where it is. I'll go on my own. Go straight, you'll see Bhola 'Rabardiwala' (sweet shop). Take a left from there, there you'll see Nata 'Golgappewala' (snack shop). Once you take a right from Nata 'Golgappewala'.. ..you'll come across Natha 'Golpapadiwala' (snack shop). After you take a left from Natha 'Golpapadiwala'.. ..you'll come across Kailash 'Jalebianwala' (sweet shop). Around 25 meters away from kailash 'Jalebianwala', is a 'Khurana Faluda' shop. There's where Chowk Chabutara begins from. What kind of directions are these? Directions of a city which loves to eat. By the way, what did you say your name was? I didn't tell you my name. Thank you. Let's get back to it. I am not out. It was a refreshment break. Start bowling. He always making excuses. Let's go. 2 bowls are left. We will win. 'Keep listening to.. '..India's number one Radio Station 98.3 Mirchi' 'Mirchi listeners are always happy.' "Turn around, girl. The boy's honking for you." How dare you misbehave! I am not misbehaving. I am not teasing her. This song is meant to ask people to move aside. Shut up. - Hello? - Where are you? Yes mom, I'm in the office. - ...tell me honestly where are you? - No, I'm with a client.. In Chandigarh office, mom. I'm with a client. - Madam, please do visit Wagha Border. - Listen to me... which client is this ? - I'll call you back. - It's a very beautiful place. Are you crazy? Can't you see that I'm on a call? I think everyone in Amritsar is crazy. Bloody idiot. Madam! I won't hear a word against Amritsar. We are simple and honest people. We are not like you. She's in Amritsar and saying that she's in Chandigarh. What? - You want me to teach you a lesson? - Go ahead? I'll teach you a lesson if I get down to it. Your place, your time, my stick against your delusion.. You must have heard the rest. Wait here. - Brother! - Go ahead. Brother! Brother! Brother! He is misbehaving with me. Run, run, run.. Pull them out! What? - He is.. Hey! - Run, run, run.. Ill-mannered! Uncle, where's 302? 302?! Next to 301. Thank you. Where's 302? I don't know. Who is she? - She looks familiar. - No sister.. Till your son doesn't get married, you will feel the same. Hello. Where does Rajveer stay? Which Rajveer? The one who eloped with a girl? No sister, she is talking about the Rajveer.. ..your daughter wanted to elope with. - Sister? - Yes? Don't make me thrash you. Auntie, auntie.. 302. - It's over there. - Okay, thank you. Hey kiddo.. Where does Rajveer stay? I can be Rajveer too. Idiot. You have a lot of scurfs on your head. You mean dandruff? Don't pretend to be modern. On your head its seems like.. - ..a lots of black nits running around.. - Hello. Where does Rajveer stay? Over there, the door that's locked. Okay. When will he come back? Do you too have to take money from him? No, I am here for some work. But he doesn't work. What work could you have with him? Are you his friend? No. His girlfriend? No. Are you thinking about marrying him ? - No. - Don't even think about it. The girl who get married into this locality have a tough life. We too used to be like you. Slim & fit! We were once title holders, Miss Ludhiana, Miss Patiala and Miss Gidharbaha. Look at us, we are all missing out now. Thank you. Why did you make her run away. Good that you made her run away. If such a beautiful girl would have married and come here.. ..then all of us would have looked bad in front of her. Sir, can I have your phone please? I need to tell my family that I won't eating at home today. If it is ready then ask them to send it over me. Don't waste my talk-time and get back to work. - Do you have a PCO around? - What? - A PCO? - No, there isn't any. Can I use your phone? I left my phone in a rickshaw. - Yes sure. Take it. - Thank you. Thank you. What have you done? - It slipped. Not my fault. - Your hands aren't working? I didn't realise. I didn't do it on purpose. Pick-up! "I fly above the rest.." Stop the rickshaw! Stop! Stop the rickshaw, man! Okay, okay. Stop the rickshaw. What's wrong? Your rickshaw is vibrating. There's something in it. Vibrating? It's must be because of you. It cannot be possessed. What are you trying to say? What do you mean? That I am fat? Am I fat? I mean you should be thankful that the government stopped toll tax.. ..or else you would have to pay tax at every junction. Damn you! May you get ruined. You are making fun of me! May your rickshaw's tyre blows up. May you be ruined. May its chain fall off. May.. you should drown. Get lost! Pick up. Uncle, I'm taking a ball. You took one before as well. - I ate it. - What? You are doing well. Why do you need to worry. Right? You should first pay for the ball. I am not running away. We always come here. I forgot my wallet. - Hi Reet. - Simmi, listen.. If mom calls tell her that I am at Chandigarh office. - What? - And also tell her that you met me half an hour ago. - Where are you? - I am in Amritsar.. ..to reject the boy my parents have selected for me. A boy? In Amritsar? What's going on, Reet? Tell me everything. It's a long story. Listen to me. I forgot my phone in a rickshaw. His phone number was in my phone. Somehow, take his number from my parents. - I'll call you back in some time. - Okay? Bye. - Shall we take another one. - Thank you. We haven't even paid for this one. What are you doing here? I never said that we would never meet again. Did you find the address you were looking for? Yes, I did. It's a very bad locality. Really! Then you should have gone to some other locality. I am not here to take a house on rent. I had come to meet someone. The people there made me go crazy. Very weird people. You know they don't even know how to talk to someone. Come on, if you wanted to talk you could have done so with me. You didn't have to go so far. Yeah. Shut up. You took offence to it. You talk a lot. What do you eat? Amritsari Kulchas (flatbread). - Would you like some? - No, thanks. Is there.. any coffee shop nearby? Any? No, many. There are many coffee shops here. I couldn't find even one. Do you have coffee shops in residential complexes in Chandigarh? You have to go out to the market to find one. Tell me where it is. Take a left from the Tikkan Sweet Shop over there. No, come back. - You'll get confused. - Chotu.. Who are you addressing as Chotu? Be a brother and walk her to the coffee shop. Is she related to me? They see a girl and start treating a friend like a servant. Here's your phone. You can walk her there, I am leaving. There you go. He's asked me to do it. - Let's go. I need to come back. - No, thanks. I'll go on my own. - Rickshaw! - No, no, no. - Excuse me, please stop.. - Madam, lunch break. - There.. - No. Strange people! Let me drop you. No, thanks. I'll manage. I never said that you cannot. It's because of the culture of Amritsar. We help everyone. Are you flirting with me? Hello! I am not like the way you think I am. I am not even thinking about you. Then I am the mad one who worry about a girl.. ..roaming around in this scorching heat. Are there any cabs here? Even auto-rickshaws run only one alternate days here. At this hour, you won't get any thing anyway. I am from a decent family. You shall leave as you came. Hop on. Come on. 'He's wearing a turban, I can trust him.' Shall we leave? Don't pillion riders here wear a helmet? Here even the riders don't wear one. Thank you. Six years ago, someone helped my father cross the road. We send sweets over to their house on every Diwali. Are people of Chandigarh so rude? They just say thank you? You want me to buy you a box of sweets? No, but you could at least offer me some water. Are you sure? - Huh? - No, no, no, no. Are you sure you are not flirting with me? Oh come on! This is the difference between people of Chandigarh and Amritsar. What you call flirting is something we call manners. If a girl had said the same thing would you say that she's flirting? Would you like some water here or inside? Inside. Even doctors advice against drinking water while standing up. Let's go. Take the keys out of the motorbike, I forgot to. Take them off, we need to go back as well. Otherwise, we will have to push it around. Have you ever seen such a coffee shop? Yeah? Yes, ma'am? Hi! A coffee for me, a latte. And water for him. - Okay, ma'am. - Hello! - Yes, sir? - I don't want water. I too want coffee. And, sir want something to eat as well. A grilled sandwich, well grilled on both sides. With three packets of sauce. - Now you can say okay sir. - Okay, sir. You respect yourself a lot. No, I respect others as well. But I respect myself a little more. Hello, Bhola. Brother, we increased the like count on Karamjit Anmol's page. I have already called him up thrice, he still hasn't paid up. Hack his page like we had hacked Jaspinder Bhalla's. He will pay double the amount now. You look upset. I lost my phone. I left it in the rickshaw I was travelling in. Do you know the rickshaw driver? Do I look like someone who'd be friends with a rickshaw drive? It's not so. I asked because you are a local. Well, I can find out. But what brought you here. Do I need to tell you? Fine then, you can find your phone on your own. I had come to meet a prospective groom. - Oh. - Why, oh? Can only a boy go to meet a prospective bride? A girl cannot go to meet a prospective groom? So you met him? I already told you, his house was locked. Then call him up and ask him to come here. His number was on the phone which I have lost. Now I don't know for how long will I have to wait. To say no to him? How do you know? I overheard you when you were talking on the phone. You are so unmannered. You stand and eavesdrop on other people's conversations! I would have taken a seat but there was not chair there. And as loudly as you spoke, everyone must have heard it. Give it here. #Cappuccino, #DrinkItFast By the way, why do you want to reject him? Are you seeing someone else? Shut up. Still.. My parents fixed our marriage without my consent. He too is an idiot. He just saw my photograph and agreed to marry me. Bloody idiot. Right! You tell me! I don't know how he looks like, what he does. Whether our nature will match or not! Whether our thinking will match or not! Nothing! He just said yes. You are absolutely right. You need to have a good understanding in order to get married. - Thoughts should match. - Right. Did you notice something? We just met a while ago and our thoughts seem to match. Don't try to get too friendly. Finish your coffee and go home. This is the problem with boys. Just talk to them and they will start flirting. Hello! Chandigarh boys must be doing that. Not the boys from Amritsar. If you had to reject him, you could have just called him. Why did you have to come here? I will have to sit and explain it to him. So that he says no for this match. I am not dying to meet that Amritsari boy. What do you mean by Amritsari? Because he is from Amritsar. Amritsari. But you don't need to say it in such a degraded manner. Boys of Amritsar are 100 times better than boys of Chandigarh. No way! You cannot even talk properly in a single language. Bathing, sleeping, doing, "ing" for everything! People can at least understand what we say. It's not like how you all speak. A mixture of English, Hindi and Punjabi. If you ask someone where PGI is, they say. Take left from the round about and you'll reach PGI. You don't realise whether it is Punjab's capital or Bihar's. Our language is so sweet that even when we abuse someone.. ..they say, can you abuse us again, please? Right? - Okay, I'll get going then. - Where to? You told me to drink the coffee and go home. Okay, I'm paying for my coffee you pay for yours. I'm not carrying any money. What are you all staring at? Continue to do what you are doing. What do you mean by you are not carrying any money? Fine then put these on your instagram. #GettingBeatenUp # WashingUtensils Listen, I really don't have any money on me. I was only out to play cricket. I didn't need any money. We don't place bets while playing. Please pay for me, I'll pay you later. Why should I pay your bill? I am riding a bike that worth 1,500,000. Do you think that I won't pay you back 200? Deduct it from this. Sorry ma'am, you'll have to give us the exact change. We don't have any change. I don't have change either. - Now what? - What do you mean by now what? Now tell us where do we go to wash the utensils. Over there, sir. Don't you have any shame? You are directing us to the place where you wash utensils.. ..when you have Paytm! What's the bill amount? You made me beg her for no reason. Here you go. I paid for you as well. - Thank you. - There you go. Tables have turned now. Earlier someone had to pay someone. Now someone has to pay someone. Let's go to the ATM. Let's go. Stop the rickshaw! Stop it! - I told you to stop it! - What? I said stop, can't you hear me? What's wrong, sister? Your rickshaw's seat is vibrating. No, it's not so. Some people are having that misunderstanding since morning. What misunderstanding? Do you think I am lying? No, I didn't mean that. Then what did you mean? We caused bloodshed because of the truth and you call us a liar! No, sister! Please listen to me. What should I listen to? You are calling us a liar. Get this straight. I neither lie nor do I tolerate liars. If you keep blabbering then I'll teach you a lesson. Please forgive me. I cannot say about the seat but I surely am vibrating out of fear. - Now he gets back on the track. - Yes. Stupid! Get lost! Let's go. I don't know why the seat is vibrating. Why are you getting acting weird? Do you want to get me killed? Nothing's happening. How is it vibrating? You vibrate only when passengers sit on you? Why don't you vibrate now? Damn you! Next time I will tear you apart and throw you away. Do you understand, Murari Express? I'd say don't bother. It's my treat. No, thanks. Here's your 144 rupees. We're quits now. You are giving me exact change. The way you keep tab on the money, I think you are an accountant. I'm a fashion designer. Oh. That's why the 36-24-36. That's my client's dress size. Whatever it was, it was great. Tell me something, how did you like Amritsar's fashion? Outdated. Now do you want us to wear Safari Suits while going out to play? Hello! Listen, at least tell me what are we lacking in our fashion? It doesn't have the Chandigarh vibe to it. When I buy clothes from Amritsar how can it give Chandigarh's vibes? It lacks in swag. Your style makes one feel that you wear clothes only to cover your body. That's the point of clothing. Not like you girls wear hot pants and make the world follow you. Even the elderly who can't see, try to focus on your legs. Why? Don't the girls in Amritsar wear shorts? They have been ruined by the fashion of Chandigarh. At least you agree that the world is crazy about our fashion. It's not your own. You follow trends in abroad. You copied from them and that too a trend of torn clothes. Torn pants, a sari made out of net. In them you look like you just had a fight with a mad dog. Our fashion is original. When a Amritsari girl moves out with Pulkari (embroidered) dress.. A flower in her hair, plaits with colourful extensions.. Anklets on her feet and sandals that quack when they walk.. People say stop.. A Punjabi girl is passing by. Do you know why I am saying this to you? So that you know that our fashion is original. It's not outdated, it's modern. Arrogant much! So, I finally managed to silence you? - Modern? - Yes. Have you ever kissed a girl? What are you talking about? About kissing. You are modern, right? Have you done it? I haven't. But I will if someone asks me to. They are right in saying.. ..that there are two types of boys. First are Idiots. And second? Bigger idiots. And I can't decide which category do you fit in. Have you ever done it? I had tried once. When I got closer to the girl, she started crying. She started crying? It was my first time. I didn't know how close do I need to get. I ended up stamping her foot. I am a decent boy so I got confused. - So I left it there itself. - Then? Then? I massaged her foot with hot water and dropped her home. You dropped her home? It's our culture. I was bound to drop her home. What kind of a culture is this? You first make the girl cry and then you drop her home. Can you ever do anything right? Have you ever done this illegal act of kissing? Why should I tell you? It's not like I'll tell everyone. Who knows? What if you do? You will only benefit from it. You have come to reject the boy. He will reject you instead. It is not so. I am well-cultured Indian girl. I am not a Alien either. You managed to get all the information from me.. ..but didn't tell me anything. You wouldn't have believed me even if I'd told you. You boys always have a bad opinion about girls from Chandigarh. Have you done it? Yes, I have. But it's not a big deal. I mean, with friends. Like on the forehead, or on the hand.. Even if that friend is a boy? A friend is a friend. The only requirement is a clean heart. Can we be friends? I am talking about my college friends. I'd asked mom to let me stay in a hostel in Chandigarh. - But she didn't agree. - Oh really? Where is your culture now? I wanted to go there to teach Chandigarh Amritsar's culture. Forget it. Help me find my phone if you can. Sure. Let's go. Here you go, sir. Give a cup of tea to me as well. - I'll get it. - I'll pay you tomorrow. What is wrong, Murari? What do I tell you? I am having such a bad day since morning. Whenever a passenger sits on the rickshaw.. ..after a while they ask me to stop. They say that the seat is vibrating. When I ask where is it vibrating, they slap me. I haven't made a single rupee since morning. And I have already been slapped five times. I had told you to buy a top model rickshaw. But you didn't listen to me. See, now your rickshaw turned out to be faulty. It is not faulty. I got it checked by a mechanic. - You got it checked? - Yes. Then why does it vibrate? That's what I don't understand. Show it to Talli then. Has Talli started repairing rickshaws now? Then don't show it to him and keep getting slapped. I don't know from where do we start looking for your mobile phone. There are more than 10,000 Biharis working in the city. So what do we do? Let's lodge a complaint at the police station. Perhaps they might be able to find it. Let's go. No, I can lodge a complaint at the police station on my own. - You go and continue with your match. - That I will. Everyone in the locality must be waiting for me to bat. Listen.. Which way is the Chabutara from here? Chowk Chabutara! You cannot even get a name right. People of Amritsar are crazy.. ..to say yes to a girl from Chandigarh just by looking at her photo! You talk a lot. What do you eat? I can't say about me, but you do chew on people's brains. Now if we call sector seventeen as sector between. Or call sector twenty-two as sector very few? Your city has strange locality names. It's not so in our city. Loon Mandi, Ghee Mandi, Gur Bazaar - Papadanwala Bazaar! - Well done! You know all the markets named after food. You only can't get Chowk Chabutara right. Fine, tell me where is Chowk Chabutara! That's where I am going. Hop on! Hop on! Stop! - Here? - Stop. Stop. Why? Don't you want to go inside? It's not right. I'll go on my own. Right. He might think that.. ..you are rejecting him because you're going on with me. Don't you think too much of yourself? - Just worried about you. - How nice of you. Thank you. Bye. Bye! I've been driving her around from so long and all I get is a sad bye. Yes, Bhola? Hey girl, you are back! Is Rajveer back? No, he isn't. If it's urgent, leave a message with me. I'll pass your message to him. No, I wanted to talk to him. Fine, then keep visiting if you have nothing else to do. "You keep wandering in Amritsar.." Okay Bhola, I'll be there in 10 minutes. - Bye. - You are still here? Bhola had called so.. You said no to him so quickly? His house is still locked. What kind of a boy is he! Such a beautiful girl is here to reject him and he has gone missing. I suggest you put a board outside his house which says.. 'I reject you.' How would he know who rejected him? Is he expecting someone else's rejection as well? - My phone! - Oh no! She has brought this Sardarji along to beat me up! - My phone! My phone! My phone! - Run, Murari! Run! Run, Murari! Hey! Stop! Stop! - Run! I didn't do anything! - I'll tear you apart. - Leave me alone. Don't come after me. Give way! Move aside! What are you staring at? Get lost from here. Killed me! - Back off. - No, you back off! Back off! Hello! Stop! Go, go, go hurry up! Move aside! Stop! - I'm driving, what more do you expect! - Catch him! Get closer to him, I'll catch him! You are not Milkha Singh that you'll be able to catch up with him. I said get closer to him. Don't stop! Come on. Stop! Stop, stop, stop! I think he has motorized his rickshaw. Stop! Stop stop stop! Have you lost your mind? Did your motorbike break down? I am out of gas. - You don't put gas in it? - I did. And you ran out of it so soon? It's not a Luna that once you fill the tank it will last for a year. - What happened? Out of gas? - Stop! Gas station is over there! - Stop following me. - Push it. - He once again ran away because of you. - Push it! - Push harder! - Come on! Where's your Bhola who had gone to get gas for you? There he is. - Bhola! - Yes. I asked you to get gas! Why did you bring buttermilk with you? - It is gas. - In a jug? At the pump station they don't allow to take gas in a bottle. It's Gas, they not giving gas in bottle A wedding procession! Shall we go and dance? I'm going. You may leave after fill gas in motorbike. Okay, bro. "Listen to what I have to say." "Today we will dance and have fun." "Listen to what I have to say." "Today we will dance and have fun." "Everyone will watch us in awe. We'll brew up a storm." "Let others get jealous, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Though I am an expert, who goes through the drill every day." "But you are highly intoxicating.." "You give a high like no other." "You are highly intoxicating.." "You give a high like no other." "You are highly intoxicating.." "Don't worry about anything." "I have the whole of Amritsar under me." "Don't worry about anything." "I have the whole of Amritsar under me." "There is good music playing, everyone's surrounding us. "There is good music playing, everyone's surrounding us. "Let me be your beloved!" "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "You are highly intoxicating.." "Come on dear.." "You are highly intoxicating.." "Give me a chance, hold my hand.." "You will forget Chandigarh, I guarantee that." "Give me a chance, hold my hand.." "You will forget Chandigarh, I guarantee that." "Don't stop me anymore, you too hit the dance floor.." "Heed my advice, I have only your best interest in my mind.." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "Let the world go to hell, don't bother." "Come on dear, let's dance together." "You are highly intoxicating.." "Come on dear.." "You are highly intoxicating.." How much is this one for? It's for 2500. What? It's very expensive. Quote the right price, I like it. What according to you is its right price? 500. Come on. You should give me your phone number. I'll consult with my wife whether.. ..I should pay for your dress and call you back. I have been looking all around for you. What are you doing here? Why? I came here to buy a dress. You were busy dancing at someone's wedding procession.. Someone's.. It is a wedding procession in Amritsar. I knew a few of the guests. I can even dance where I only know the horse the groom is riding. So, did you buy the dress? No, he was asking 2500 for it. Such dresses are available for 500. It is right for a girl from Chandigarh to bargain like this? It's okay, you can assume that I am from Bhatinda. I want to save my money. How can I forget the coffee incident? How much you love money. This isn't about loving money. It's my hard earned money. Will you pay 600 for something which is worth 500? I have bought cylinders at a premium price many times. I am talking about a serious matter. It's not about being money minded. Everyone wants money. Everybody saves money. If you had come with your wife.. ..would you have brought that dress for 2500? Yes, if my wife was hot I'd even pay 3500 for that dress. You never would. You might have asked her to pay with a promise that you'll pay her later. Like you did with me in the coffee shop. I am not like that always. I was out to play cricket. I was worried that I might drop the money while playing.. ..so I didn't carry any money with me. See.. This is known as knowing the value of money. This is not being money minded. Then you will save a lot of your husband's money. Why? He'd save his money and I'll save mine. Strange! What kind of a girl are you? You don't even love your husband? How does this concern love? Love doesn't feed you. By the way, I am starving. Can we have something to eat? You want Fried Bread? Yuck! I don't want anything that oily. My mother says that one should look healthy. You should eat more, you look weak. To be slim is not a disease. Fitness is in fashion. Then someone should say that to the poor.. ..who keep complaining that they are weak.. "Bro, it's fashion!" You talk a lot. Don't you ever get tired? Made in Amritsar. Oh I see. What's the name of the hospital where you were born? At home, with the help of a midwife. Shall I get you something to eat? Please. - Excuse me? - Yes. - Can I use your phone? - Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hello? Simmi, it's Reet. Whose number is this? Did you get his number? - Here, talk to him. - Okay. Reet, with whose permission did you go to Amritsar? Mom? If you didn't want to marry him, you should have told us. Why did you have to create a scene here? Do you always have to insult us? Like you would have agreed if I'd said no? You were making preparations without my consent! I know what's good and bad for you. I am your mother! Mom, please just give me that Amritsari's number. You should come back to Chandigarh right away! Understood? I don't want to marry him. Are you crazy, Simmi? I told you not to tell mom! I couldn't help it. She just showed up. Anyway, take his number! Tell me. 9372624291. Thank you. Here, have some Amritsari Kulchas. No, thank you. I stood in a queue and brought them especially for you. You should at least have a few of them. Please stop talking. I want some Peace (Shanti) - I brought these from Shanti! - Oh shut up! Here, you can have them. Please take them. Enjoy. Why don't you silence him as well? Let him crow, you keep quiet. Let me think in peace. If he flies away then I too will stop talking. People of Chandigarh come so far to think. We usually do the thinking on the commode. No matter whatever noises keep disturbing us. Keep quiet for five minutes. I don't know what to do now. Mom knows everything. It's not like your mother would tell everyone in the locality. Anyway, you know your mother better. Don't you ever get upset? Look, I won't lie. I have been set with alcohol after 8 a number of times. But I have never been upset. By the way, I've seen you get upset. You must be mistaken. We've just met. When did you see me get upset? When we got separated in the market. You weren't upset when you couldn't find me? Why would I be upset? Are you sure? You feel so because you are very upset. You tend to manage a lot of things at once. You think something, you say something and you show something else. I don't do anything of the three things you said. I am not as smart as I look. You are over smart. Actually, it is not your fault. This is the problem with all the people of Amritsar. They never express their feelings. If you felt upset then you did. It's not a big deal. Say it. Yes, I was upset. What's there to express in that? What if you would have gotten lost? Then? Then it would have been an insult of Amritsar. Police would have questioned me. 'We saw the girl having coffee with you on the CCTV camera.' 'Where did she go?' Fine, don't accept it. But there is something going on in your heart. There is a hole in my heart. Saw it? Listen to her blabber. She keeps talking about the same thing. I don't like girls like you. - Arrogant much! - What do you mean? I mean I don't like them. Stop, stop, stop. Give me your hand. Why should I give you my hand? I am not going to marry you. - I need your hand to help come down. - Oh, for that. Come on. Why don't you like girls like me? Well, I just don't like them. I am a person of high level. Oh. That's why the girl cried when you got closer. It was because it was the first time. What about the second time? Don't I have anything else to do? I am a well-cultured boy. That means she cried the second time as well. Second time it was another girl. What! Things didn't get so far! How many girls have you had? Officially, just one. Give me an extra small size. You mentioned one earlier, the one who cried. Don't count her. She cried. Tell me the second girl's name. It doesn't matter? Enjoy the Golgappas (snacks). I'll eat the Golgappas from my mouth. I'll be listening to her name through my ears. Tell me her name. I'll be using my mouth to say her name, won't I? Let me eat them. Anyway, the name doesn't matter. Well, that reminds me, what is your name? Don't change the topic. This is the problem with the people of Amritsar. You always give weird replies. Tell me her name. Sungchi. What's that? A girl's name. - Sorry. - Here. What's so funny? Let's go. Where did you meet her? In Amritsar. A Chinese girl in Amritsar? Yes, she was here to do a research on Punjabi folk. Then? Then I helped her. Was she beautiful? She was hot. Small eyes.. A beautiful smile.. Long hair.. Intoxicating gait.. How did you manage To understand her language? There is no language of love. I know she had small eyes, but we spoke a lot through our eyes. How sweet! By the way, who was the one who fell in love first? It was me. Then she followed suit an hour or so. How did you manage to impress her? Girls are usually dumb, but she was smart. She liked my songs. - You can sing? - I write as well. Not bad! Why don't you sing something that you wrote for her? Should I? Come on. "Her forehead shines.." "Like a bright sun." "Oh her smile.." "Oh her smile.." "It is a killer." "I fell for her gait.." "I fell for her gait.." "She looks are deadly." "She looks are deadly." "Not even a hundred moons can match up to her brightness.." "A glimpse of her.." "A glimpse of her feels like possessing the Kohinoor." "She gives you such a high.." "She gives you such a high.." "She's something you can never forget." "She's something you can never forget." That's it? Why didn't you finish the song? The feelings aren't awake as yet. When they are, the whole song will be out. By the way, you sing quite well. It is hard to find such boys these days.. The one who write songs for girls. No, many write but girls don't listen. Why? Girls value money more than a boy's feelings. And what is wrong in that? Every girl wants security. Do boys run on government subsidy? It is not so. But everyone asks that question these days. I am sure Sungchi must have asked it as well. What are your plans for the future. Yes, I had told her. That after marriage I'd like to have two kids. That's family planning, we are talking about future planning here. He wants kids. Everyone asks how much do you make? How educated are you? Look at me and tell me, how educated do I look? Let it be. You'll insult me again. Let's go. - What work do you do? - Whatever I come across. I increase the like counts on the Facebook pages.. ..and views on YouTube for Punjabi artists. What kind of a job is that? The whole of Punjabi industry is dependent on it. Punjabi industry reminds me.. We needed to increase the like count on Binnu Dhillon's Facebook page. - Bhola? - Yes, bro? Binnu Dhillon has uploaded a picture on Facebook. Put a few hundred comments on it. 'Hot, dashing, amazing!' 'Bro, you look great!' Bro, it's a very bad picture. I am not asking you to find a match for him. We have been paid for 10,000 likes. - Get to work. - Okay, brother. Do you want us to increase the like count for you? - No, thanks. - People already like me a lot. That is true. So, did you manage to turn Sungchi into Sungchi Kaur? No. You made her cry as well? She left on her own. You didn't fall for anyone else? Didn't find anyone who is like Sungchi. You didn't find any or you didn't look at anyone else? We can control everything in our life except for our heart. By the way, you don't look as emotional as you are. Now do you expect me to listen to sad songs like hopeless lovers? Bygones are bygones. Move on. Okay tell me, have you ever been in love? It's getting late. My train leaves in the evening. Now after make me spill my heart out you can only think about your train? Wait! Where are you running away? Come on, tell me. You don't have to make your heart fall, it just happens. I knew you must have done something revolting.. ..because of which you have some to say not to the Amritsari. - It is not so. - It is so. It is your fault and you are blaming my city for it. By the way, what do you know about our Amritsar? Prince is from Amritsar. Prince? Boyfriend. Oh. Then you better reject this boy. Otherwise, you'd ruin your husband's life and have coffee with your boyfriend. - Not everything is a joke. - This is not a joke. I know such cases quite well. If a person meets his or her old lover after your marriage.. ..then it is no less than a reason to celebrate for them. Please stop saying such rubbish things! Nonsense! - Who is nonsense? - You are! I know that, but why? Why shouldn't I? You have been only troubling me. You are asking why I came here to reject the Amritsari? This is why I have come to reject him! You don't need to reject him! I'll go and tell him that I've checked you out on his behalf! You are a girl without manners, you are worthless! Now I will be the one who will call off your wedding. She too started crying? Please calm down. Please don't cry. I didn't mean to hurt you. It will be bad for my record. People will say that I make every girl cry. Please. You were right. I am nonsense. I have a habit of just blurting out. I cannot just stop joking. You said what you actually thought about me. Now don't try to cover up. All the boys are the same. It is my fault. What do you mean by all? I mean all. Even Prince. - Oh. You cried because of him? - Yes. I thought I made you cry. Couples keep have such small tiffs. Tell me something, who do we fight with? I can fight with anyone. Come here. - Bro, please leave. - Let me fight! Who fights with a stranger? Tell me, who do we fight with? I don't know. The one we love. The one we believe wouldn't leave us. Why are you saying that to me? To get you into a better mood. To calm you down. Prince too must be doing the same. Prince is no longer a part of my life. We used to fight a lot. No matter whose fault it was, I am the one who had to always give in. I am the one who used to say sorry. He never realised his mistake. No guilt at all. But, its ok. I too am a human being. I too get hurt. - Then? - Then what? It broke in such a way that I didn't feel like making things right again. I came back. I thought this time he will come to cajole me. But he didn't. Boys have a lot of ego. And I value my self respect. So, I didn't go to him either. Anyway, forget it, why are we talking about this? Hey.. Why are you getting so emotional? I am not a helpless girl. And please don't offer me your shoulder like boys.. ..usually do when they see a girl crying. I can take care of myself. Come on! Let's go, we are getting late. I don't understand, when you know relationships so well.. ..then why didn't you get married to Sungchi? I told her to leave. I will come across many like you. But you didn't look at anyone else. Can I give you a compliment? That I have a beautiful smile? No. When you smile, you look over beautiful. Why did you leave Sungchi? She was Chinese. So? Dad said that Chinese goods don't last long. She is not goods, she is a girl. Dad addresses them as goods. You have a way with words. Sungchi said we would stay separately after marriage. Without my parents. She is right. What is wrong with that? All of them are the same. It is better to get separated before you start fighting after marriage. You want me to break an old relationship to form a new one? Even the girl leaves her home. It is an old tradition. It is we who have created this tradition. Let's make a new tradition. Both the girl and the boy leave their homes. You have lost your mind. So both girl and the boy will cry after the wedding ceremony. People will say that if you both are crying after the wedding.. ..then what is the use of getting married? Better if you stay in your respective houses. I didn't ask you leave your families. Festivals, functions or at the time of need... We can go over to their place or they can come to our place. Then it is not like a home anymore. It is like a girl visiting her parental home. We do that. Why don't you do something which you expect the girl to do? You mean to say we should leave the one who brought us up.. ..nurtured us, educated us only for your sake? Girls are brought up with more affection then boys are because they are sensitive. Yet they leave their home. Then let them stay in their home. You have changed the topic. Fine then. People are right when they say that you should marry.. ..the one with whom your thinking matches. Good that Sungchi didn't get married to you. Prince was better off than Sungchi because he left you. What did you say? Girls like you are the reasons why families get ruined. If all boys think like you do then no girl should marry them. I think you boys should marry each other. It's legal now. I doubted that you want a girl. That's why you are rejecting this alliance. Shut up. It must be your turn to bat again, please get lost. I will pull apart the pillion seat of my motorbike. If there is no pillion seat, no girl like you would sit on it. "You've celebrated enough, it's time to shed tears in solitude now." "I tried to reason it with you, but you were being stubborn." "You should have thought about this before falling in love." "Oh my heart, now get back to the life.." "..which you lived before she came into our life." "Oh my heart, now get back to the life.." "..which you lived before she came into our life." "Don't fall for it. Don't make yourself yearn." "Don't trust love." "She took along the dreams which I saw with her." "You are only left with my shattered dreams." "She took along the dreams which I saw with her." "You are only left with my shattered dreams." "The life you were living before you set eyes on her.." "Oh my heart, now get back to the life.." "..which you lived before she came into our life." Hey bro, forget batting.. And go get the girl. "Don't fall for it. Don't make yourself yearn." "Don't trust love." "You will be separated from those that you want to always stay with. "Situation hasn't changed, you are in the same state again." "You will be separated from those that you want to always stay with. "Situation hasn't changed, you are in the same state again." "The state you were in before the joy entered your life." "Oh my heart, now get back to the life.." "..which you lived before she came into our life." I sat alone and gave it a thought. What you said and what you meant were two different things. You aren't asking us to leave our parents.. ..you want an equal relationship. Even boys should do what the girls can do. Sorry. Thank you for understanding me. It is not about staying together or getting separated. It is about love. Thank you. Sage! Sage! Sage! Sage, please give me your blessings. I don't know what is wrong. I am in a lot of trouble. Passengers run away from my rickshaw after travelling only a short distance. - Passengers run away? - Yes. I haven't made a rupee since morning. I have already been slapped five times. - Slapped? - I am going crazy. What do I tell you? There's something in it. That's why I have come to you. I have not come here to make you grease the wheels. Tell me something, did you pass over a lemon this morning? Yes, I had gone to the vegetable market. There were potatoes, eggplants, cauliflower, okra... Lemons too must surely be there. There is no ban on them. That's it. A ghost left a lemon and possessed your rickshaw. - A ghost? - She won't let anyone else sit on it now. Lemons have ghost in them? Sage! Sage, please help me. My wife and my kids will starve to death. - Sage! - Tell me. Come home early this evening, we have to attend a wedding tonight. Whatever you say. I also need a new dress. You will get that as well. Sage, please tell me how do I get rid of this ghost. Don't worry, I just spoke to her. You spoke to her? What did she say? She wants a new dress. A new dress.. My wife has a new sari. Will that work? Talk to her. Would a sari do? No, no, no, I want an embroidered palazzo. Bye. She wants palazzo pants, that too embroidered. I have only been slapped today. I'll give it tomorrow after I make some money. I promise. Talk to her. No one knows what tomorrow holds. She wants to wear the dress tonight. She will start possessing me in the evening. A lemon is causing me a lot of damage. Don't worry. I'll handle the situation today with the help of a dress. Watch out for lemons in future. - Sage! - Go. - Can I go now? - Yes. Take a right from here. What happened? Take right. - Right from there. - Okay. Right, right, right. Wait, wait, wait, go slow, I'll tell you. Keep going straight. Stop, stop, stop! - Stop! - What happened? What's wrong? Run, run, run! - Why? Whose house is that? - Prince's house! Prince! What are you doing? Let's run away. - Let me be of service as well. - Hey! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! - Go! Go! Go! - Okay, okay, okay. "You entered my life like a new dawn." "You dreams are mine, from now." "I will declare it to the world..." "I will declare it to the world... I am in love." "Whether or not you agree beautiful, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "Whether or not you agree my darling, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "You are the one I always want before my eyes." "I'll make all promises expected and follow all orders." "You are the one I always want before my eyes." "I'll make all promises expected and follow all orders." "Follow all orders." "My love for you is true." "My love for you is true." "I have learnt its true value." "Whether or not you agree beautiful, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "Whether or not you agree my darling, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "Whether or not you agree beautiful, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "Whether or not you agree beautiful, God has brought us together." "God has brought us together." "Whether or not you agree beautiful, God has brought us together." I'm getting a call. It got disconnected. It was Bhola. I'll call him later. Can I use your phone? - Sure. - Thank you. - He didn't answer it? - It's busy. Who knows, he might be trying to call on your number. Anyway, forget it. By the way, I'd thought that.. ..I'd surely go to Golden temple when I reached Amritsar. How far is it? If you close your eyes, it's right in front. Otherwise, 15 to 20 minutes. But we need to buy you a Punjabi dress before we go there. We'll take you there as a Punjabi Jatti. Fine, let's go. What happened? I need to buy a dress, please get rid of this lemon. This lemon won't harm you. Go inside. Are you going to remove it or shall I go to another shop? I'll remove it, go inside. It is not my fault, I am doing it for you. Go inside. Go on. - Greetings! - Yes, what do you want? Show me a palazzo, a cheap one. But it should be embroidered. A palazzo? Of what size? Size? How do I tell? I haven't seen the one who is going to wear it. Give me one in free size. - Sonu! - Yes, sir? Get the palazzo of the latest fashion. Jacqueline style. Here. How much is it for? Rs.2000 each. Rs.2000! Give me a minute. Do you want this one or this one? Tell me. Please tell me which one do you want. This one or that one? Please.. Where are you going? - I'm going in to try them out. - They are meant for ladies. - Okay, okay, okay. - He is crazy. Have you ever seen such a big shop that sells Punjabi dresses in Chandigarh? No. People there don't wear them. Brother, show us a nice Amritsari dress. - Right away, sir. Please have a seat. - Yes. Jyot, get Amritsar's special dresses. Give them to me. Amritsar's special dresses. Wonderful. I like this one. What say? It will suit you. - Should I try it out? - Yes. Where's the trial room? That one's occupied. This one is empty now. - You can try it over here. - Okay. I'll be right back. How do I look? Like someone dear. You look like a local because you are wearing an Amritsari dress. Can I use your phone? It's with you. Sorry. Again busy. He likes to talk a lot. Tell me something, this way will take you to the station.. ..and that way leads to Chowk Chabutara. Where do you want to go? Can we go and have a coffee? Why just a coffee, we can order two cups of coffee. You said that there are many coffee shops here. Yet you brought me to the same one. There are many but this one is a little special. Special.. He parked right in front of us. Let's go. You've come to my city and you'll leave without meeting me? Who is he? Why are you asking her? Ask me. I'll tell you who I am in great detail. I too give a deadly introduction of myself. Prince, you should leave. - I don't want to create a scene over here. - Who is he? He is Prince? What hit you here, a stone or a brick? A brick. Why? My brick. Prince.. Leave. Who is he? Tell him who I am. Sorry, I really don't know who you are. I don't even know your name. Look at yourself. You are roaming around with someone you don't even know. And then you accuse me of being wrong. I am roaming around with a stranger.. ..because he is better than people that I know. I want to talk to you. Didn't you hear her? She said this stranger is much better than people she knows. She won't talk to you. Buzz off. Please. This is my personal matter. Let me decide who I should and shouldn't talk to. Go inside. You wait here, I'll go and talk to him. Why do you need to talk to him? Why are you so upset? What if he manages to cajole you? How would that affect you? Look, Prince has come here. Now I will have to talk things out with him. I am a girl from Chandigarh. I am neither afraid of any situation nor do I run away from one. I'll be right back. You always came to cajole me. I thought you'd come this time as well. Anything else? I didn't know that it would hurt you so much. Now you know? Forget it. I am sorry. It's okay. Can I leave now? What is wrong with you? When two people are in a relationship, they tend to make mistakes. I made one as well. Our relationship only consisted of you. I was nowhere a part of it. I promise to change myself. Ma'am.. Thank you. Sir, you are waiting outside? Madam is inside. You too should come in. Yes, she is sitting with her brother. She is talking to him about our relationship. About your relationship? Best of luck, sir. Shall I get coffee for you? No, I am okay. - You should go and ask them. - Okay, sir. If I go back to you, you'd be as you were. No, I won't. Give me a chance. Try to understand, Prince. A person's basic nature never changes. You are pleading me because I am not with you. You would have never been this polite if I had been with you. Why don't you understand? I really love you a lot. If you don't believe me then ask my friends. Wonderful. You are the one who loves me and your friends will vouch for it. It was in front of them that I'd slit my wrist. - Ma'am, what should I get for you? - No, thanks. And for your brother? Run away before I hit you. Sorry, sir. Fine, let's do one thing. You don't say yes to someone just yet. Let's give our relationship another six months. You can say yes to me when you start believing in me. Sir, I don't think it will work out for you. Her brother is very angry. It is a good thing that he is angry. Would you like it if I consume poison? They are calling out to you. Oh.. Sorry, I don't know how it happened. - You should go and dry.. - Who was calling out to me over there? Oh, he was calling out to them. I am so sorry. You should go and dry your clothes. Go on. Don't worry, I'll wait for you over here. - Go and dry your clothes. Okay.- Thank God it wasn't tea. She would have burned me. Reet! Run, run, run! Not there, on your motorbike! We got to hurry, we got to hurry! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! You said you don't run away. Go! Go! Go! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Go, go, go! You got scared and started to run away! I am not scared. I just feel that fighting doesn't help. Rickshaw! - Rickshaw! - Yes, sir. Rickshaw! Yes. - I want to go to the hospital. - Okay. Have a seat, sir. Drive slowly. I suffer from slip disc. Don't worry, sir. I will drive at zero speed. A passenger is like God. You will think that you are in Mercy car. - Mercedes? - Yes, exactly. - Have you settled down, sir? - Yes. - Is this speed fine? - Yes. That's it. This speed is fine? - It is fine, maintain this speed. - Okay, you don't worry. Stop, stop... She has brought a Sardar-ji along to beat me up. Stop! Hello! Don't stop, take a U-turn. I don't think Prince is a good person. You should rethink about this. It's not him, it's my phone! Turn around, turn around, turn around! Before you kill me, at least tell me what crime have I committed? At least tell me what crime have I committed! Tell me if I have ever hit you! What have I done wrong! No! Driver! Stop, stop. Why did you stop? I asked you to follow him. There is flour all around, my bike will get dirty. Drive from the side then. Let's go. Follow him! Stop! - Stop, stop... - Drive fast. Brother, please. Behave yourself and give me your licence. - I just need to go over there. - Give me your licence. Give me the money. Pay up, come on! - Move aside.. Move aside.. Move aside.. Move! Stop the rickshaw. Why should I listen to you when I don't even know you? - I'll tell you who I am! - Now I will never stop. I am well respected in this area. Please be a brother and stop. Take something and compromise. Take some money from me. - No, no, no. I don't want money. - Brother, please.. You being a police officer are trying to bribe me? Don't you have any shame? For God's sake let me get off it. Drive faster! Hold on. Move side. Let me just get hold of you! If I don't make you pay for this then I am not Daljit Singh! Move aside! Lord, please help me. Save me. True Lord, help me. Minister will entering in your area, block the all roads. Okay, sir! Don't stop! Keep going! - Move fast. - Move back! - My phone. One minute, listen to me. - Stay back. - My uncle is a station house officer. - What is the name of your uncle? I just forgot his name. Move back. - Please let me my phone... - Uncle is here. - Hey! - There he is! [Prayers] Oh, my God. Now I will drop you at the right place. - You thief! - Stop, stop, stop! You thought that you can escape me? Brother, please hear me out before you hit me. Are you from Amritsar? Yes. I badmouthed her when she badmouthed Amritsar. - How is it my fault? - Hey! Heard that? When a man from UP cannot tolerate.. ..someone speaking ill about Amritsar then how can a Sardar? Well done, brother. I'm proud of you. You can leave, my dear. Where is my phone? - Tell me. Come on. - I only have this phone. - This is your phone? - I spent 1100 to buy it. - Take it. - This is not my phone! You sold my phone! - You sold my phone! - Give back her phone. I swear, I don't have it. Hey mister, why is this seat vibrating? - This seat is possessed. - It must be my phone. It is possessed by a ghost. - Found it. Great. - I found it, I found it! Well done, brother. Always keep such noble thoughts about Amritsar. Let's go, Mr. Amritsar, or I will miss my train. Bless you. Okay. This phone was the ghost. Mr. Disc. Sir.. Please get up, I'll get your discs repaired. Come on, sit down. Stay away! Stay away! This is where I wanted to get down. - Please have a seat, sir. - No! There are 25 minutes for the train to come. Can you do me a favour? I have written on this why I don't want to marry him. Give it to the Chabutara guy. Chowk Chabutara. Ok. Your train is about to arrive. Trains are arriving on time these days. Silence can sometimes be so weird, right? Silence, where? There is so much noise in here. People are talking, announcements are being made. Phones are ringing. Okay then.. Bye. Don't shake hands with me. I make girls cry. Honestly.. thank you. It was a pleasure to meet you. Same here. Bye. Bye. My phone. Of course. I didn't even realize. You can keep it you want, I had found it somewhere. You shouldn't lose the things you find. Give me your phone number. Quickly. My phone's battery is almost drained out. Why do you need my number? It's not like we are going to meet again. Just remember today's day. That is a smart thing to say. I am a smart person. I have been roaming around with you since morning.. ..did you ever feel that I am crazy? Okay, did the guy who lives at Chowk Chabutara call you? He didn't call and I am not interested. Just give him that note. Forget the note, just call him up and say no to him. No. After I met you, I realised boys of Amritsar are very emotional. I won't be able to do it over the phone. That's why I have resorted to giving him a note. By the way, we have been together since morning.. ..and yet we don't know each other's name. What is your name? Name? #Ambersariya And what's yours? - Okay, bye. - Bye. Hello. Oh.. Oh hi. Yes, I had gone to your house. It was locked. Auntie told me. No, I am already at the train station. The train leaves in 15 - 20 minutes. Okay fine, let's meet outside the station. Bye. What happened? Bro, someone hacked a few of our pages. Artists are saying that you aren't paying attention. They want their money back. Where are you? I'm struggling. Hang up. I'll be there in 10 minutes. What are you doing here? He called. Prince? You got convinced? Not him.. The Chowk Chabutara guy. Oh my, the Chowk Chabutara guy. You got it right this time. What did he say? Nothing. He wants to meet me outside the station. He has asked me to wait. And you are waiting for him? There are still 15-20 minutes left for the train to arrive. He sounded fine. I think.. You might end up with him. It is not so. He called, he said let's meet. That's why I had come here. Then shall I tear the note? Your wish. Or do you want me to put it in an amulet and hang it around my neck? She was all set to leave for Chandigarh but she came back. Don't you over think sometimes? He is here! Someone's so excited to see him. I think you should call him.. ..or your train will leave before he arrives. What happened? Battery drained out. Your phone is so troublesome. Sometimes its battery drains out, sometimes it gets lost. Do one thing, throw it so that I can pick it up. Very funny. Here, call him from my phone. His number was dialed before yours. 'Passengers please pay attention.' - It's busy. - ''The train from Amritsar to Chandigarh..' - '..Intercity express will leave from platform number one in 15 minutes.' They are announcing my train. Forget it, I'll get going now. Bye. Wait a minute, how does your phone have my number in it? Forget that and tell me why doesn't the call get connected.. ..when you dial a phone number from its phone? Dial a phone number from its phone? It will never get connected. It's impossible. You dialed it.. ..not once but twice. Called this phone number from this phone. You said that you'd marry someone who knows you, understands you.. ..someone with whom your thoughts match. Look at how God plays his games. You came to me to inquire about my address. I thought I won't find a better way to know my life partner. I had agreed to marry you just by looking at your picture. But you are more beautiful than your photograph. Will you marry me? Can I say something? I shy beautifully? When you feel shy, you look very beautiful. Hey Miss Arrogant.. Before you leave at least let me know whether it's a yes or a no. If we get married you will try to act smart be calling yourself Amritsari. If we get married you with be an Amritsari's wife. You too will have the same pride as mine. Fine, then you too will have to fulfill all the conditions required.. ..to be Chandigarh resident's son-in-law. I'll fulfil them. First give me the guarantee that I'd be Chandigarh resident's son-in-law. By the way, what are the useless conditions of the Chandigarh residents? What do you mean by useless? Whatever they might be they will be better than Amritsar's. Dream on! I have seen how you behave! If a girl from our city had gone to say no to someone.. ..she would have done the job in five minutes and returned. Whereas you came in the morning and are leaving in the evening. And yet we don't know whether it's a yes or a no. Okay, so that means you are smarter. - No. - Then? - You are less smart. - We are crazy? - No. - Then? You are mad. We are better than you are. We don't all keep "inging" all the time. Try stopping your kids when they to do the same. I'm going! Really.. So you are "Going!" Going only to come back. Bye Miss Arrogant!
