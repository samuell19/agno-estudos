- There's - Look at those, cool. - This was no ordinary outing to the zoo. It was a very special occasion. It was part of a programme filmed in 1964 when we brought together a group of seven-year-old children from vastly different backgrounds. We went to prep schools, primary schools, state schools, and private schools and picked out 14 children. We brought them together because we wanted a glimpse of the shop steward and the executive of the year 2000. "Give me a child until he is seven, "and I will give you the man." These children are now 14, halfway between childhood and manhood. This is our interim report. - If we did all love Jeffrey and we all want to marry. - Yeah. - I think I know the one that he'd likes best, and that's her. - Jackie, Lindsay, Susan. - Plenty of boyfriends, but not one-- - Not one in particular. You're friends with plenty of boys, you know. - My heart's desire is to see my daddy, who's 6000 miles away. - Bruce. - You know, I've been getting on well with my stepfather, and I like to see my father occasionally and he does come over from Rhodesia. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Nicholas from the Yorkshire Dales. - I don't want to answer that. I don't answer those kind of questions. No, I'm not answering that one. - Suzy. - I gave that up as a failure. - I was gonna be a policeman, but I've thought how hard it would be to join in. - Paul. - Basketball appeals to me most, but with this school, I'm one of their best players in form two, but when I get into a team, they make me look like I can't play. - I feel like bundling when there's already a fight. - I was gonna be a film star, but-- - Symon. - Now, I'm gonna be an electrical engineer, which is more to reality really. - Singing Waltzing Matilda in Latin at an exclusive pre-prep school in Kensington, we chose three boys. Charles, Andrew. - I read the Financial Times. - And John. - I read Observer and the Times. - What do you like about it? - Well, I like, I usually look at the headlines, and then read about them, about it. - I like my newspaper because I got shares and I know every day what the shares are. - Stuff like misers like you like. - No, but on Mondays, they don't move up, so I don't look at it. I made several blunders on Seven Up. For instance, I said I was going to Trinity Hall instead of Trinity College. They didn't like that too much, nor did my father. Also, I rather exaggerated when I said how much I liked stocks and shares because I don't anymore. - How do you think you've changed since you were seven years old? - Well, I mean, one grows so slowly that one never notices honestly. I feel the same as I felt at seven, I may not be. When I leave this school, I'm going to Collet Court, and then I will be going to Westminster Boarding School if I pass the exam. - John passed the entrance exam, and is a weekly boarder at Westminster School. - When I leave school, I'm going the Dragon School, I might, and mummy's, and after I might go to Charter House Marlborough. - Charles is at Marlborough. - When I leave this school, I go to Broadstairs' St. Peter's Court, then after that, I'm going to Charterhouse. - Andrew is at Charterhouse. - When I leave this school, I'm down for Heathfield and Southover Manor. - Suzy is at Southover Manor. - Would everybody please sit round now? - For one-third of our children, their education was pre-planned and paid for. The remainder went to state schools, and their future seemed less certain. - I want to be a jockey when I grow up. Yeah, I want to be a jockey when I grow up. - Tony is on the way to achieving his ambition. He spends all his free time at Tommy Gosling's Racing Stables at Epsom. - My dad got on to Mr. Gosling. Mr. Gosling told me I can come here for every school holidays and learn a bit more. Next April, I'll be leaving school, and I'll work for him for good. - Did your parents encourage you to do this? - Yeah, they're pleased with everything what I've got, you know, going to do, but they always has wanted me to be a jockey. - Why? - Enjoyment, just to say, "My son's a jockey," like, you know what I mean? - Tony's change from elementary school to Secondary Modern didn't alter his ambition, but how about the other children? Has a change of school changed them? Bruce was at a pre-preparatory boarding school in Surrey. - And that's farmer heath gives me nightmares. I was about five when I went there, and then, I suppose I was too young really to understand it, and I thought it was a bit severe at the time, but then I just got used to it, and didn't have sort of any impulses to do things wrong, anything like that, and I just got into the track of. - We're supposed to go sideways. - You know, of what they said you must do and mustn't. - Right, steady. Let's go left foot everyone, place. Squad pleasing. - At St. Paul's, I like the companionship, you know, with other boys really. It's a bit, and you get that much more in a boarding school. - Well, I think boarding makes you feel self-sufficient and also teaches you to be away from your parents, and to live with people for a long time, which you have to do in later life anyway. - Well, I agree with that a certain amount, but when you board on a weekly basis, you have the best of both worlds, so to speak. One sees one's parents at the weekend, and one gets all the benefits from an English boarding school. - I think prep school boarding is a bad idea because up til about 12, maybe it's different with other people, but I've found you're much more attached to your parents once you come to about 13, 14, you're not quite so attached to them. - Two of our boys who didn't have the chance to be attached to their parents were those brought up in a children's home supported by charity, Symon. - I had one dream, and everything flew up in the air. It all landed on my head. - Symon stayed at the home until last Christmas when he returned to live with his mother. - They say, "Where's your father, then? "You know, when your mum's out at work, "stay with your father." And I just tell them, I ain't got one. - What effect has that had on you? - Well, I don't think it's had any effect on me because what you don't have, you don't miss, as far as I can see. - Also at the children's home with Symon was Paul. He and his family emigrated when he was eight. - I don't like the big boys hitting us and the monitors up in the washroom sends the nurse out, and there's no talking, but I wasn't talking today, and Brown sent me out for nothing. - What do you remember of England? - It seemed to be raining all the time. I wouldn't stake my life on it because I can't remember very much. - He went to Australia to start a new life. - Well, I was going to become a bank accountant, but it's more book taking, the mess, and that was main reason I was thinking about becoming a panel beater. And I don't know why now I've stopped thinking about that. I just haven't made up my mind yet. I was going to be a phys ed teacher, but one of the teachers told me that they had to get up into university. - Were you happy at the children's home in England? - I mean, I didn't mind that really because we didn't know what was going on because I was a bit young. - Were you happier then than you are now? - In a way, yeah, I was, but then, I'm happy for being at home. At the school, everything you wanted, you just had it, and everybody was your friend, and you never knew any enemies, really, but here, people are undecided about you. They could be your friend one day, and not the next. - And then I moved up to a comprehensive school. I found it much bigger, of course, and I found it hard to settle into at first. - From a Liverpool suburb, returning home from the comprehensive school, Neil and Peter. - I'm much more happy here than when I first came. You get so many different types of people. People different sort of brains, you know, from the very clever people to you know, people who haven't got much sense at all really. Well, we pretend we've got swords, and we make the noise of the swords fighting, and Lancelot he stabs us, we go. I've been playing since I started at the comprehensive school since the first year. We play international wrestling. - Yeah, that's only summer time, though. - Yeah, only when we can go in the grass. - There used to be a senior team, but they all lost interest. Watch this, checkmate. - Oh, hey, gosh, it is. How did you do that? I guess it's a very good idea to have competition otherwise, you might start to relax really and not to try hard enough. - What do you think? - I agree, yes, it's a good thing. If there was no one to compete with, you wouldn't be trying so hard. - The three little girls from East End had the choice of going to a comprehensive or a grammar school. - I'm going to work in Woolworth's. - Lindsay chose the grammar school. - Why am I using a wooden spoon, please, to stir the saucepan? - The noise. - The noise, yes, we've got 16 people, 16 saucepans, we don't want the noise from 16 people stirring with metal spoons. - This is my first choice, and this is where I turned up even though some of my friends were going to the other school. - I didn't feel like going to a grammar school. I just, you know, comprehensive school, it just seemed more friendly, you know. At the time, yes, but now they may be different. - Grammar school's fantastic. - If you say so. - Well, we've all got our opinions. - I like-- - What advantages has a comprehensive school got? - Oh, especially this school, it's new, and they've got everything you could want. They got equipment. - What I enjoy about this school is, with this school, we do metal work and woodwork, and the boys do cookery. And we get our share of everything as it were. - It's good though, learning metal work, innit? - Well, in a grammar school, I don't think you'd find many girls that really want to do metal work or woodwork. - Now, see that's what I mean. That's the difference. - That sort of shows the difference in the people. - One of the keys to the character of the seven-year-old was how they spent their free time. Bruce had his school band. - When I go home, I come in, and mummy gives me a cup of tea, and then I go out and play. And when it starts to get dark. I come in again and put on TV. - But I don't got to go to bed til 7. - I usually go to bed 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock. Sometimes I go dog racing. Of course, I like going there for something to do at night, so I don't really do anything at night, only running dogs or watch other things, watch telly. - I don't watch very much television. - I used to watch it a lot, but I'm not watching it so much, and I think it's good because lots of it is corrupting me a bit. - A like serials, like Peyton Place and Crossroads, always watch Crossroads if I can. - For one thing, the advertisements, you know. I can recite about six tunes off of it, and it just seems a worthless thing to know. - There's too many things going on at school though we do have a television, and at the weekend, they can be more selective, and there's not much that I like. - Well, I'm quite interested in archaeology, and we're doing a local dig at Vinscomb, near our school. - Being in Set One, it's very, very hard to keep up with the leaders. I never have a time to relax at all. - What do you do in an evening? - Just go out with friends normally. - Yeah. - Or to clubs sometimes. - Yeah, there aren't many clubs around here. It's disgusting, it really is. You hear people talking about it on television, but it's really bad round in the east end. It really is, there's hardly anything. - There's always something to do here. I mean, I'm never, ever bored. - Suzy now lives in Scotland on her father's 4000 acre estate. - It's very, very small really when you got one spare room, there's my room, there's Molly's room, it's very small. There's a kitchen and a dining room, the drawing room, and really, we mostly sit, sit when we have people in. That's really it. - What sort of things do you do? - Ride, swim, play tennis, ping pong, I pray croquet, things like that. - What about the social life? What's that? - What in Perthshire? - Yeah. - It's quite fun. We've got some things going on. - I think your dog's got a rabbit. What should we do? Do you want someone to see it? - Max, bring it here. Oh, disgusting, that was the second one you've given in the second week. Oh, Max, for God's sake, leave it alone. - Does that worry you? - Nope, not at all. Here I see birds and things wounded. I don't like that, they run off, and you never get a chance to kill them. - Why doesn't it worry you if things have to be killed? - Because I've been brought up to it. - Da, da, da, there's not in too late there. Quite quietly, it's very nonchalant little theme, you know, butter wouldn't melt its mouth, so take it very quietly, let it just present itself. Half beat. There we go. Da, da, da, da. - We have about 10 pianos and practise rooms, and there are orchestras, choral societies, and two choirs, well, it's a marvellous music system. I think there's too much competition nowadays. There's so many good pianists, and only very few make a great one, and I think it must be very disparaging if you can only get half the way. - Are you ambitious? - Yes. - What for? - Well, fame. And power. - What sort of power? - Political power. - Are you ruthless? - Not really. - Do you think to have political power, you got to be ruthless? - Yes. - Well, what qualities do you need to have political power then if it's not ruthlessness? - Great strength of mind. - They'd like to come out for a holiday in the country when I'd like to have a holiday in the town. - I've been to Leeds a couple of times, and I haven't been to Manchester. I went to London like with the other programme when you did the first programme, but that's the only time I've been. - Nicholas won a scholarship to a Yorkshire boarding school. - In this village, there's me, and then the next oldest is Andrew there, that's it. I'm not unhappy, living on the farm, and going to this school and boarding there. It's all right, I think it would be better than living on the farm all the time. I don't like to live at the school all the time either. - Do you want to take up farming? - No, I'm not interested in it. I mean, I'm not, and I said I was interested in physics and chemistry, well I'm not gonna do that here. When I grow up, I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that. - Did your father want to be a farmer? - I don't think he really wanted to be, but he got stuck with it because my grandfather, he certainly probably wanted him to be a farmer, but I don't think my father wants me to be a farmer. My youngest brother, the deaf one, if he can't do anything else, he can probably run a farm if he can't, that's it, but as a last resort. - Not 'til this holidays have I been out of Europe. This holidays, I went to America to stay with somebody from school. - Have you been abroad? - Austria. - What was it like? - Not bad. - Would you like to travel? - Nope. - Well, I ski in Switzerland, and I enjoy that immensely, and we went to France this time, and I've lived in Rhodesia. - I enjoyed Switzerland the most I think. I think its a very beautiful country. We went to very interesting places. I also enjoyed Austria, but not to such a great extent. - Well, I've never been abroad, but-- - No, neither have I. - I have. - Oh, yeah, because you went on that cruise thingy. - Yeah, went to Spain and Gibraltar and Casablanca. - Yeah, that's it. - Yeah, that was interesting that. - Travel doesn't really interest me much, happy where I am. - I've been to so many places. Sicily, Italy, France and Spain and Switzerland, many times. - Have you travelled much? - When I was at the school, we used to have outings, used to go to Box Hill, places as such, and we used to go to mystery tours, and drive around the country, and we went to history museums for outings, and geographical museums, and science museum. I've been to Madame Tussaud's with my mum, and the planetarium. - Do you want to go abroad? - Yeah, I'd like to go to Mallorca, take a couple of weeks out there from everything. Relax meself. - No, but I said that when boys go round with girls they don't pay attention to what they're doing, and since my grandmother has an accident because a boyfriend was kissing his girlfriend in the street. - The girls never do what the boys want them. They always start playing with dolls when the boys want to play rough and tumble with them. - It's quite true. - Beginning to become a bit more important, yeah. - In what way? - Well, they're no longer just bores who won't play this or something. - They're over half of the community and they're there. - You can begin to talk to them. - I think they're still bores for the most part. - When I get married, I'd like to have two children. - Would you like to have a nanny to look after them or do you want to look after them? - No, I want a nanny to look after them. - Have you got any boyfriend, Susan? - Well, my girlfriend is in Africa, and I don't think I'll have another chance of seeing her again. And there were two in Switzerland, which I liked at the hotel. - Have you got a girlfriend? - No, no not yet. I'm sure it will come, but not yet. - Say you had a wife. Say you had to eat what they cooked you, and say, I don't like greens, well, I don't. And say, she said, "You have to eat what you give." So I don't like greens, so she gives me greens. And that's it. No, I'd prefer to be alone, really. I wouldn't mind living with my brother, you know, but otherwise, I'd prefer to live alone. - Sometimes on Saturday, well I mean, I go to the pictures, sometimes with my friends, sometimes with him. - You don't. - I do. - She don't. I don't ever see you. You go to a different pictures. - Have you got a girlfriend? - Nope. - Would you like to have a girlfriend? - Nope. - I thought that one would come up because when I was on the other one, and somebody said, "What do you think about girls?" And I said, "I don't answer questions like that." Is that the reason you're asking me? - Yeah. - Well, what do you want me to say? I don't know what to say. - Once Caroline Tetford said she loved me. - What happened then? - And I'm gonna marry her when I grow up. - Oh, I hate her, she's always getting bad-tempered and cross with me. - Is she? - Yes, she says, "Neil Hughes, move your desk forward." Perhaps we're not mature enough yet to be interested. - See, he loves Susan because Susan loves him. He loves him, so Lindsay loves him. - I don't love-- - Have you got any boyfriends? - That's personal isn't it? - I don't like the way you come out with that. - We shan't tell you, we shan't. - What do you think about making this programme? - I just think it's just ridiculous. I don't see any fun in doing it. - Why not? - What's the point of people going into people's lives and saying why do you like this and why don't you? I just don't see any point in it. - What's the point of the programme? - Is the point of the programme is to reach a comparison? I don't think it is. Because we're not necessarily typical examples. - And I think that's what people seeing the programme might think. - Yes. - Falsely. - I mean, they'll tend to typecast us. - So everything we say, they'll think, "Oh, that's a typical result of a public school system." - Well, in what way aren't you typical? - Well, I'm a bit more reactionary than most. - I don't know, none of the parties really seem agree with me, but I think if I had voted, I'd have voted Labour. - I'd have voted Conservative. - I don't think I would have voted for any of them. - Conservatives. - The Conservatives will do the best for the country. - I think they're all as bad as each other really. - Labour. - I don't really know. - I know what I wouldn't vote. - What way? - Labour. - Conservative. - Why? - Why? I honestly don't know, I don't know because I don't really know much about politics. It doesn't interest me, so I never really bother. - I didn't agree with the Conservatives about what they were doing with the black people. You know, racial politics. - What do you think about coloured people? You said to me once that you like them, but what do you really think about them? - Well, they're nice, they're just the same as us really, but one thing that it's only because their skin's brown and we're white, sort of pinkish we are. - Do you think of a purple person with red eyes, yellow feet? I can't really think of what they really look like. - They're just the same as me, aren't they? - I don't know anybody who's coloured. And I don't want to know anybody who's coloured, thank you very much. I haven't got anything against coloured people, but it wouldn't worry me if I never met one until the day I died. - Everybody's gotta get used to knowing coloured people, and coloured people in turn have got to get used to being with white people because if either side doesn't work properly then no side will work properly. People just got to mix in with everybody else. - I don't think it's wrong that in a country like England that there should be places where there are more coloured people than the white people. - Good old Enoch. - Well, personally, I've got nothing against coloured people. I think they're the same as everybody else, but it seems that there's lots of arguments about them because as any foreigners really they're taking people's jobs in England. - I don't care what colour somebody is, unless they're blue, and I think that would be pretty peculiar, but we might find somebody yet. No, I don't care about colour. - Well, I think both black and whites are equal as long as they're as well-educated as each other. - What do you feel about racial discrimination? - It's rather vile. - Why? - Because so is any kind of discrimination. Of a basic nature that you can't change. I mean if you're, I couldn't care less whether people are discriminated against because they're nasty or selfish or anything, but I mean, one can't help one's colour, so. - Now you're interested in politics. You'd like to be a politician. What kind of things would you change? - I wouldn't allow any strikes. - How would you do that? - I'd set up a tribunal where people, workers, could apply for better wages, and this tribunal would have the final word, and if said no wage rise, no wage rise. - It's a big problem, there's lots of discussion I've heard. The workers do tend to take a few liberties as regards to strikes. - Who do you think is to blame for strikes, the workers or the management? - Well, that's management probably because-- - Say the workers because we'll probably get loads of letters saying we'll be having none of that. - It seems to be iniquitous that people should be paid when they're not doing any work, which is what the unions do to you. - I'm not commenting because Mum's been out the strike. - Yeah, so has mine. - It's very irresponsible because we all want more money, as much money as we can get, and what would happen if we all stopped working just because we wanted more money. - If they want the money, why shouldn't they strike for it? If you wanted a raise, you would strike. - Yeah, that's why they-- - But they're gonna strike for it, right, and they're gonna get more money. Now the school meals are going up, so that means they're gonna strike again. They want more money, and it's just gonna keep going and going and going. - Surely by crushing strikes, then in a way that's defeating a small part of democracy. - No, it's not because they'd still have their, they'd still be able to ask for more money, but they wouldn't be able to strike for it, which I mean-- - Yes, but they'd-- - They're so damaging. - That's still depriving them of their freedom to strike. - Well, so is putting people in prison and depriving them of their freedom to go on killing people and stealing from people. - Anyway, who's going to do this because if they do it, they're not going to be voted into Parliament. So it's not worth-- - You can always decide on your policy once you're in. - What do they think about each other? And how would they act together? To find out, we invited them all to one big party and joined in. ♪ If I say that I love you ♪ ♪ And you know it's true ♪ ♪ If you said that you loved me ♪ ♪ What would I do ♪ ♪ I'd let you back if you let me ♪ ♪ I'd choose the madness ♪ - Yes, but they were a bit too tough for my liking. They hit me right in the back, and I've still got a pain there. - The pushing, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. They're nuts, just have to touch them. - Well, I thought some of them were rather dirty. - What do you think about them? - I played with them quite naturally. I think they were rather nice really. - What do you think about rich people? - Well, not much. - Tell me about them. - Well, they think they can do everything without you doing it as well, and they think just because they're rich and they have to have people do, like they have to do all their work and stuff. - What would you do if you had lots of money, maybe two pounds. - Me, I would help the poor. - Yeah, 'cause the poor except you don't help them, they'll sort of die, so wouldn't they? And every time we have a harvest festival, we send 'em food so once these two. No, Janet, Susan and Janet went round giving a handout with Mr. Floyd. - I don't think much of the accents. - Neither do I. - But it doesn't prevent me liking them. Yes, and rich children always make fun of poor children, I say. - Yes, they say, "Oh, look at that lovely little sissy over there." - Yes, and they throw things at them. The poor child gets scared to death. - Do you meet here many boys from very different social backgrounds? - Not really. - Do you find that a lack in your life? - No. - Why? - I don't feel any lack anywhere. - Do you not feel you should be meeting a broader sort of person from different backgrounds? - Not really. - You don't think you're missing? - No. I mean, there are people from so many, I don't see what backgrounds got to do with the people from so many, I think it's interest that makes it worth other people with so many varied interests in this school that I can't imagine having any more. I don't really see where background enters in. - If everybody had the same as everybody else, nobody would be missing anything. People, rich people, they have all different things, have everything they want whereas poor people, they don't have nothing, and they know they haven't got nothing, and so they know they're missing something. - What are you missing? - I'm missing a bike and a fishing rod. - Yeah, well, they can get what they want, can't they? If you've got to work for it, if it's them, they can just ask for money and get it, and they can get whatever they want. - What effect does it have on them? - Spoilt, like it spoils them, doesn't it? - I think if you're going to accuse us, of public schools of producing snobs by mixing only a couple of classes, upper, middle, then comprehensive schools can be accused of producing prods because they only mix with lower and middle. - But it's like saying the public schools like Tom Brown's school days. We do mix with people from the town. - They can be all right. - Yeah, but I don't like people who are too posh. They look down on everybody else. - They think they're better. - Yeah. - I think people are much more conscious of wanting to become snobs because the differences that used to separate the classes have diminished greatly. I mean, when one was duke, one used to be set above everybody else, but now, look at the Duke of. - I think people are becoming less class conscious because I mean, with for instance hippies. You don't get the impression that one hippie says, "I'm the big guy "because I'm upper class and you sort of some petty person "because you're low class." - Yes, and anybody can become a hippie. - I think this is happening throughout the country. - They don't sort of enforce being upper class and things like that at St. Paul's. You know, they suggest that you don't have long hair, and they do get it cut, and they teach you to be reasonably well-mannered, but not to sniff on the poorer people. - Some people are good with money and give it to charities and that, but some of them just don't know what to do with their money, so they just spend it, waste it. People need it. - I think poverty for anybody. It kind of depresses me. - When I went to Glasgow and I saw the Gorbals, that rather upset me. - Why? - Well, to think that people are living in that state when we waste things everyday. - Well, some people are just born into rich families and they like it. - I don't see why they could have the luck when people worked all their lives and never got half as much as what they have. It just don't seem fair. - No. - I usually get about five to six bob a week. - And what do you do with it? - I save some, spend some. - Well, I get a pound a week, and usually during the middle of the week, my mum takes 10 bob back, and I save the other 10 bob as much as possible. - Well, out of my permanent jobs, I'm getting four dollars, 40. - Eight shillings a week. - What do you spend it on? - Well, I need to spend very little at school, and I collect stamps, so I spend quite a lot of that on that. - My dad gives me about two pound a week, and my mum gives me about 30 bob, and my brothers give me some, and Mr. Gosling gives me four pound pocket money every week. - I don't particularly want to be rich, but I'd like to have enough money. - What do you mean by enough? - Enough to have a nice house, and be able to send the children to a private school if we want to. - I mean almost everybody likes money not for the fact that it, well, I don't like looking at money. It doesn't give me any pleasure like that, but I certainly don't want to be poor, live in a slum, but I don't, I mean, a person with one million pounds is not gonna be more unhappy than a person with two million pounds. - Money's not everything. - I mean, it does mean a lot to us now with cars and new fashions and everything, doesn't it? Midis and that, you need money because-- - What's midis? They're clothes, yeah, you need clothes, but money can't buy happiness. - Oh, no, you could work for that yourself. - Do you want to be rich? - I don't mind I'd like to stay where I am. I don't want to be too rich I don't want to be poor, poverty. - What about you, Jackie? - Just live comfortable. - Just to have what you want, really, no extras. - Just as long as you've got all you need. - Do you want to be rich? - I wouldn't mind. - Do you want to be rich? - Yes, because I don't want to be tied down to the dullness of an everyday job, I want to be able to have enough money so I can indulge in the things that might interest me, like collecting paintings. - No, because if you're rich, you get bored of being rich, same if you're poor, you get bored of being poor. You can't have too much of a good thing. - I think if you're healthy and have good friends, you can get on perfectly well. Everybody would like to be rich. - Mainly, to be self-sufficient, to feel that you don't have to owe anything to anybody. - I'd help people if I had the chance. You know by say giving a little bit of money to charity or sponsoring things or things like that. - I think it's wrong that one should drive oneself to make a lot of money because in the end, you might have caused so many people, might have ruined so many people that you would be unhappy. What's the use of a lot of money if you're unhappy? - You have to have it to live, and there are problems that you have to face, and everything's concrete, and it doesn't seem to be possible for anything to be invisible or sort of you can't see it. I mean, people, all the scientist have said, we've looked up into space, and we haven't seen God, so there isn't a God, and it just seems fatuous. - Do you believe in God? - I'm not sure whether I really believe in God or not. I think to myself is there a God? I don't know, so I don't know. - Yes, I'd say I believed in God. - Are you religious? - Well, I go to church with my parents on Sundays. - You've got to believe in something, so God seems to be the most logical I think. - I wouldn't say I'm deeply religious, but I do believe in God. - Why? - I mean, that's a difficult question to answer why. I mean, I just do. It's an either yes or no question. - Well, you're brought up to believe in him, and you do. - And you must have your own opinion on that as well. - But how do you know? I don't really know if I do or not. I don't really think about him much. - No, you don't have that much time to think about him. Not when there's so much activity taking place in school and after school. - That's the sort of thing I'd like to sit and think about or talk to someone about. - When I sit down and think, I think I believe in God, but if somebody just asked me, I'd say no. I suppose it's just to be big. - Why do you believe in God? - Well I believe in God because if somebody had to make the world, this world, then call him what everybody else calls me, which is God. - You can't really tell if there's a God or not, can you? You haven't seen him, then you can't say. - When you were seven, you wanted to be a missionary. Have you any thoughts on that? - No I don't want to be a missionary because I just can't talk about it to people. You know, I'm interested in it myself, but I wouldn't be very good at it at all, and I wouldn't enjoy it. - Why wouldn't you be good at it? - Well, I'm just not very good at anyway, standing up in front of people and making a speech or anything like that, but I'd like to keep it private, you know. Well, going to Africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be more or less good. - And after that, Trinity Hall, Cambridge. - I'm going to work in Woolworth's. - I might go to Oxford. - Oh, I'd just walk around and see what I can find. - I'm gonna be, think I'm going to Cambridge and Trinity Hall. - Well, I don't I need to go to university because I'm not gonna be a teacher. - I don't think I want to go to university if you want to be an astronaut. - What does university mean? - Where? - When I grow up, I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that. - If I can't be an astronaut, I think I'll be a coach driver. This is probably linked up with the fact now that I think I want to travel. My thoughts haven't really changed, so I would definitely would like to be a coach driver now. - You wanted to be an astronaut when you were seven? - Yeah. - What feelings have you got on that subject? - Well, I've changed my mind completely of course. I mean, it was just the imagination a seven-year-old has. - I would buy meself a home, a new nice house, you know, but it's all nice and comfy. I'd like to be able to have a happy family. I mean, I know that's not possible to be happy all the time, but as much of the time that was possible. - Just be content with what I'm doing, and be happy with it, and to know where I'm going, and to remember finally what I've done. - I'm thinking of following a legal career with a view to ending in parliament. - I'd like to do maybe shorthand typing or something like that. - Nothing too much, I just want to be like anybody else, really, just nothing too marvellous. - What will you do if you don't make it as a jockey? - I don't know, if I knew I couldn't be one, I'd get out, I wouldn't bother. - And what do you think you would do then? - Learn taxis, taxi driver. - There is a danger that you would get married at early twenties and have children quickly and then be stuck at home. Have you any thoughts on that? - I don't really think of it much. - No. - I don't think I'd get married too early. I'd like to have a full life first, and meet people. - Perhaps enjoy myself before I-- - Yeah, fully commit to somebody. - How do you think England will change over the next few years? - England? Not very much, England is too English, sort of. - Are you a traditionalist? - Yes. - In what way? - I like tradition. - Do you expect to live your life in England? - I think it's just about the best place you can live your life, in England. - Why? - I think the parliamentary system is agreeable, to me at least, and that's about it, why one's free in England, and one has good opportunities for everything. We've all got much more equal opportunities. In those days, the people at the bottom really had to work like blacks, so that they could achieve something. - But nowadays, to get kicks out of life, you have to use synthetic means whereas originally, earlier on, about 40 years ago, these things came in life whereas with all the modern world today, lots of these things have been sort of stopped, and a lot of the enjoyment of life has been taken out of it. - Yes, the natural enjoyment. - Hasn't been taken out of it, it's just people, it's still there if you look for it. I mean-- - But how many people can look for it? - Everybody can look. Everybody can pursue happiness. - At the end of their very special day in London, after their trip to the zoo and the party, we took our children to an adventure playground where they could do just what they liked. Those from the children's home set about building a house. There's Nicholas. And Tony. Andrew. And Bruce. John. Suzy. Jackie and her friends. Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man. This has been a glimpse of Britain's future.
