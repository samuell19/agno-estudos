Subtitles by explosiveskull My name is Sophia Crane. It's March 3rd, 2004. I'm a film student and this is my senior thesis. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be alive, so I ask whoever find this, please apply the first and second halves of this final interview to the beginning and end of my film. I don't know where to make the cut. This is the story of Peeping Tom and how I went looking for him. Please show this to my parents. I don't know how much longer I can go without blinking. Morning, fellas. Come on in. So, this is the house I was telling you about. This is my in-laws' house. The information that we have on it, it seems to have been built around 1970-75, I can't really find any information other than that, but down here in the basement is where Bart found it. I'll turn the light on. Now, I have repositioned it for presentation purposes so, if you'll bear with me... Here, just going to go and dig it out. Right now if you can see me, it was right under here. It was this... box. Come over here, I'll show it to you. Don't watch, huh. Pretty eerie, but isn't that how all good horror movies start? A little mystery, a little riddle. Well, my husband recently retired, we find this beautiful house that we both loved and I guess it was just before Thanksgiving. My husband went down in the basement, did what guys do, you know, check the boiler, check the air conditioning, play with the filters, things like that. He found this box full of tapes. She thought that Gavin could use them for work, because he does wedding videos and she thought maybe he can tape over them, or something, like to save money, but there are mini DVs so we don't really use them anymore. You know, I thought maybe Gavin can take a look at them, see what's on them, something as like a little project to keep him interested and excited about film. And the very first one that I picked up says: Final Solution. Alright, that's the first one I watched, I mean, how could you not watch anything like that, right? So what happened on the tape Final Solution, what did you see? A young lady identifies herself as Sophia Crane, a film student. Total coincidence, as a film major, film major, so already we're simpatico, which is great. She's upset about the school project, she's stressed out a little bit, and then it got a little upsetting after that and a little bit weird. Some violence, some things that I don't really wanna say right now, we don't what to give it all away. But let's just say that I had to watch about the next 40 tapes immediately after that. First thing I did was, of course, call the previous owner that we bought the house from, left voicemail messages saying that I found a box, found something that probably belongs to them. I never heard back from them, and then eventually the phone number was just unlisted. But the footage never actually takes place in your in-laws' house. No, it doesn't, and that's another kind of fun, clinky dink about this whole thing. What are you doing in regards to the home? Selling it. After the first tape, the next tape that I saw there was called Rough Edit. Everything looks really good, there is interviews on the street, really nice flow, and then after about ten minutes it gets really choppy. And it's about 40 or so tapes in here, so it's like they got too busy to cut it together and they just kept filming and filming and filming and they didn't really know when to stop. - So what did you do? - Well, being a good filmmaker as I am, I took their film and I finished it. I edited it together myself, I took their film and made it my film, so now it's finished, now it's completed the way that it should have been. And what did you think when you saw it all in sequence? Well, I didn't really sleep for a couple of days after that. Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel, home to the B&O... Shit, again. Are we rolling? Well, I mean, to me it looks it... Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel, a thruway for the B&O Railroad for over a century. But for the past 80 years, for local residents, it has become something far more sinister. It's become home to... - Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom. - The Blink Man. - Mr. Blink. - Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom. - The Blink Man. - The Ilchester The Molester. The Tunnel Guy? - Peeping Tom. - Old Blinky. Alright, so you guys have ever seen him before? Unless I'm a ghost right now, then no! If I saw him, I'd be dead. Yes, I did know this one fellow around my age, this is back around 64-65 or so, he saw The Blink Man. - What happened to him? - Well, he died. Peeping Tom is the kind of creature that you can summon up, so there is a ritual, those teen pilgrimages, you know, the midnight road trip, you show up at the trestle end of the tunnel at midnight and you have to stare down this tunnel, looking at the end for a full hour. And if you can do this without blinking, Peeping Tom comes out of the shadows and materializes in front of you. Now he's the class of supernatural creature called a Flimmern-Geist. German alchemists came up with this term in the 1500s for that thing, that you see in the corner of your eyes and when you look around to see it, there's nothing there. Peeping Tom is a Flimmern-Geist that you can actually bring into view. - Well, he's tall, dark coat. - Skinny. - Top hat. - Big scary eyes. Mostly I've heard that he's just a shadow, 'cause he's like in your peripheral vision. Instantly there, then not there, then there again. There was this one chick, in particular, a few years ago, she went to the school right down the road. Her and her friends went up to the tunnel rail and they started staring down, she was the only one who could stare for... you have to stare - for an hour. - For an hour. The twist is that once you've seen him, you can't unsee him. Every time you blink, he's a little bit closer and he comes closer and closer each time you blink until he's right in your face. He sounds scary, what does he do? - Gets you. - Gets you. And now you've already proved that you can keep your eyes open for a long time, because that's how you conjure him up. When he's right up there, the temptation is death staring you in the face, you do anything you can to avoid him. But he's got a trick up his sleeve, he has very long eyelashes and you know that thing that you do with babies, to give them a little, he does that, and then you can't help it, you blink. What do we call that... Can I show it, like... Butterfly... ...butterfly kisses. I'm pretty sure there's only, I don't know, a couple of people in the world, period, that can stare for an hour straight. I think the world record, I don't even know if the world record is an hour. I think the record is probably maybe 30 minutes, 40 minutes. It's really hard to stare at something without blinking for even 10 or 15 minutes. It will be really difficult for most people. Well, of course, there's no record of it. People too busy dying to report it. Even if you made it out to that long, I mean the vision will be quite blurred and, again, you know, I can't emphasize enough, the pain would be excruciating. As with all the best folklore and urban legends, you can't really verify any of the details in this. It's always happened to a friend of a friend. My brother's friend used to tell the story that his uncle told him. And they got freaked out after a while and they ran away but she did stay there the whole hour. Like a month later they found his body floating in the Patapsco River. She ended up trying to look out a window, she tried to burn out her eyes... By looking at the sun. Even though she couldn't see him, his presence was still there so she, you know, she thought the whole time, she gets blinks, she ended up blinking, but she... Can she beat Peeping Tom? - Can't cheat, though. - Can't cheat Peeping Tom. You know, I think you'd be pushing the limits, I think, of the human anatomy and physiology, but maybe that's possible. Obviously, from he shared with me, that would be a terrible idea, if that's for real. Absence of proof hasn't caused absence of belief. Ilchester tunnel is still a late night hang out for teenagers and a popular spot for fraternity hazing. It's a dare often attempted, but apparently seldom completed. Until now. You show up at the trestle end of the tunnel at midnight... The metadata on the tapes show that it was filmed between February 14th and March 3rd of 2004. OK, so I went back and I looked at all of the local colleges, I called, I walked into every college in town, showed them pictures of Sophia, showed them pictures of Feldman. No information. You can't get past these people at all. There's no record of a doctor Wolfe who's supposedly their professor, there's no indication that the Peeping Tom specialist that Sophia and Feldman go and speak to in his home even exists, an Asian American man, I believe he's supposed to be an eye specialist. There's no title cards to show that this person even exists. I analyzed them, and I watched them repeatedly, I looked back on every incident reported I could find that would have matched any of these people, and I can't find anything that matches up. My hunch would say he probably found either some student films or just somebody making her own horror movie or something like that. There's no cuts, there's no retakes, there's no calling for action, aside from the first two minutes of the movie, where Sophia is obviously directing herself, there's absolutely no evidence to suggest that somebody is directing them. I've been staring at it for the better part of six months right now. I believe it's 100% genuine. It looks like found footage. - Movie. - Alright. Found footage, I mean, what does that really mean? Did I find the footage? Was it handed to me and then am I presenting it again? Yes. That would be considered found footage, but as far as putting a horror movie together, I don't really think that there's any... I'm a, I'm a real filmmaker. OK, so we're not gonna be making horror movies. We're gonna try to reveal the truth of something that's a mystery or kind of get something out of it. When you make a film that is presenting itself as roughly cut together found footage, you are building in your excuse for anything that's wrong with it. Uh, hey folks, this is the footage we found, we're just presenting it, yeah. The camera jiggles all over the place, not because we didn't know how to hold a hand-held camera steady, but because these were kids lost in the woods getting more and more scared all the time. I think what would make it more real, would be if it were the first one out there and they were not following a certain genre. It works on a low-budget level and that's the primary reason for, I think, for doing it. So my hunch is either Mr. York was doing that himself and trying to get some credence to this and make it look legitimate, or he just run somebody else's project and they send it through. Just so we're all clear, the reason that he can't find the students, the teachers, the eye doctor... I believe they're actors. You realize that the first thing that critics will accuse you of, after gullibility, is faking the film yourself. Of course, of course, and that's why nobody would believe this. Because it's a pretty big coincidence that the person who finds the unfinished film just happens to be a filmmaker. Right, sure, and the naysayers are gonna say that because that's what they do, they naysay. Hum, I don't know if it's real or not, but it doesn't really matter, because he's excited about it being real, so... We're gonna take this footage to every professional in town that we can find, ghosthunters, mythbusters, we're going to go to the radio stations, we're going to the TV stations, we're going to show the footage and we're gonna saturate the market with this information. If your plan is to try to present this as being 100% authentic, why are you not simply taking the footage forward and calling a press conference right now? Why are you planning to have the video cleaned up, why are you looking to have the sound done? Well, I mean, you know, we need to present the best possible version of this thing as we can, then we're gonna prove to the world that Peeping Tom exists. The camera doesn't lie. Mel Sumner, 19, PolySci major and staring contest champion. Alright, dude, so right down there is Ilchester tunnel and we're gonna have you standing right over there on the other of the trestle, starting at 12 for an hour. Well, how the hell am I supposed to see at the end of that? Y'all, just don't worry about it. - You ready? - Yes, let's stare at it. Alright, ten seconds to midnight starting... now. - What's it feels like? - It's so hypnotic! You literally, you can't really see anything down there. I can see. That's so creepy, it's like the tunnel's like staring right back at me. This is kind of like the ultimate staring contest, you know, like... even if I win, I can never really blink again. How much, how much time we're at? - Come on, dude! - You got it, man! Please stop talking to me. - Sophia, shut up. - Stop talking. You're alright? Fuck! Oh, God! Why do you want Handycam? We're using our good camera to document this, I wanna be able to document that, OK? You realize the footage will come nowhere close to matching up, right? It's documentary, dude, it doesn't have to match. I'm gonna ignore that you just said that. So, what we're doing now is we set up this camera, I'm gonna shoot it down the tunnel starting right at midnight, it's gonna go all the way to 1:00 a.m. - Yeah. - Now this will take the place of a human eye and it will not blink, it will constantly run and hopefully right at 1:00 a.m., as the legend says, Peeping Tom will show up and butterfly kiss my camera. Look, as much as I hate to say this I think this actually has a really good shot of working before you let this go to your head simply because a lens is like an eye, OK? - The shutter, we're good, OK? - The shutter? Yes, I think the shutter. Well, technically... That's the only part of the camera... Technically, that would be blinking. The what? Alright, man, we're coming up on it. - What's the time? - You ready? What's the time? We've got ten more seconds starting now. Ten, nine... Come on, Mr. Blink, See anything? - No, nothing. - Come on! And, now! See anything? Don't kill it! You see anything? Do you see anything? Feldman, answer my question, do you see anything? Do not kill the camera, just give him a second to... Fuck! ...that you live in, but if I'm gonna be here to yada yada, clean this up a little bit, I mean, as far as the tapes go, can I make like a box, like the... - OK. - You got a shoe box , or... We'll just work on this another day. Do we have a backup plan here? Dude, dude, dude, dude! Are you seeing that? Am I seeing what? Feldman, look right there! Feldman, look right there! - Yeah! I know. - Do you see that? What? Was that there or... Do you see that? What the fuck is that? - I didn't add it! - Are you serious? - Oh, my gosh, I think... - Holy shit! Is there any way that you can brighten this, like whatsoever. Yeah, yeah, I mean it's gonna look like hell, but no, I can do it. OK, do you want me to take the camera right now? So, I'm bringing up the light. Cool, cool, do it! - Gosh, dude! - Bang! Right fucking there! That was right on the hour mark. Zoom in, zoom in. Alright, this is the closest I can get with that, and like still be able to see shit, so you ready? Alright, alright, go, go! - Holy shit! - Oh, my gosh! Look at that motherfucker! You're kidding me! Like five minutes ago, this is all over, but we have Peeping Tom here! - We fucking got him, man! - Oh my gosh! I don't see any signs that it was faked, in the sense that like it was... like someone went in with a computer and added something, like there's nothing in there that I can definitively point to and say: "OK, this is a fake." So, I would go with that, at the same time, you know, it's a small little video, there's not a lot of detail, so I'm hesitant to commit either way, but I, if it was... if something were there, it would probably look like that. You were convinced that that would just be natural lighting, no manipulation as far as that particular shot is concerned. Well, I'm not convinced of anything, it's certainly plausible. Right, but you're not ruling it out. I can't point to anything and say: "This makes is a fake." It could be a guy, dressed up, standing up in the back maybe, like, you know, it could be a practical kind of hoax, like someone could have taken this and in a computer, it's gone and manipulated it. The idea of the technological equivalent of the actual eye, which is actually a part of the human organism, and the human mind, the idea of using a camera as a real equivalent of that, metaphysical equivalent, strikes me as... I have a hard time with that. I don't know, man, you, I mean we're sitting here trying to explain spirits, so... If you want to have a rational conversation about ghosts and goblins versus camera technology, I'm not really sure. So, where are we? What are we doing? We are at the VFW in Glen Burnie, Maryland, and I'm gonna go and present some of the footage to an assembled group of paranormal investigators, ghosthunters and get some allies here. What's the end game here tonight? Well, the end game is that when we do the press conference, I can have a handful of these people standing beside me saying: "Footage is real, we're behind you, Gavin, we believe you!" And then they... I think they reach some 10,000 people or something, so... Our Facebook page has over 8,000 likes and most of those people are into the paranormal or they want to be on our Facebook page. So, yes, I could put it out there for others to see. We're just gonna show the image of Peeping Tom coming up to the tunnel. Why are you only showing the ghost and apparently the ghost proofs? Just that one shot. I don't think they need any of the other information, I think right now we're just trying to determine whether or not Peeping Tom is a real entity and the story about Sophia and the big guns and on the actual what happened. I think you want to see that. The only plausible explanation that you folks could think and myself and the first thing I thought of was this has got to be a guy in a suit, this is somebody standing there at the end of the tunnel, they're playing a practical joke, OK? The thing that this bunks that theory however is the fact that the metadata on both cameras say that there was no one else there. One camera films the other camera, we've got proof of both of that it turned on, this is what happens when they played it back. Right now you just want to pick everybody's interest, we're gonna get them to talk, "Who's Peeping Tom, the tunnel?" Right here in your mind. Just phew! Gonna get it so he showed you. Until he shows us more, we just don't know. - Right! - We believe there's a possibility, but we need more evidence. Saying everything else for, you know, that next big steps will be wolf's surprise. It'll probably work out a lot better too. So you know, you can see what I saw. I mean the journey that we've already been on. You can't tell that this isn't gonna be the shot, this is Gavin's chance, this is my second chance to make it. Fortune and glory! Let's go back a little bit, let's talk about you as a filmmaker. You went to school for filmmaking? Yeah, my non-degree, that's what I like to tell everybody it was. He does a lot of weddings, so, you know, there's wedding season and then in the off season it's kind of a little bit more spotty. And then as the years went by, it became a way to pay the bills and to still convince myself that I'm a filmmaker. Now, it's just a way to pay the bills. Isn't this wedding season right now? Yeah, it's July. I'm sorry, I don't want to embarrass anybody, but it... She's always hectic, she's always happened to come and borrow money and, and that doesn't bother me, that's what we're here for, right, to make sure that everything's... We can help out. Everything's OK. Does Gavin know that you're getting help? I mean it's not so much help that it needs to be discussed or whatever. So, let me ask you a question, you're taking their film and you're trying to show it to the world, but why aren't you making this movie that I'm making right now? Why aren't you doing a film of your own essentially rather than just, you know, taking somebody else's and finishing it? Nobody would believe this if I did it, OK? Nobody's gonna believe a documentary about me finding footage and putting it together and running around. That's why we need you, that's why you're here to tell the story. Because if the audience doesn't believe the footage, then you're in the same exact place. Come in! Fellas! - Gavin, how are you doing? - How are you? Gavin York. I want to make sure that this is well thought out, put together with a lot of care. We're in this business because we like to entertain, but we're in this business because we want to make money, OK? It's found footage, I understand, it's a found footage style. Well, it's real. As in "It's found footage, because I found the footage." - OK. - I actually found it. - Right. - OK. But you understand why it looks suspicious that rather than just putting the footage out there, you are having it cleaned up and mixed for theatrical release. But who is gonna know that? You're treating it right now like a movie. But why can't you treat it both? Cleaning it up kind of defeats the purpose of it being this gritty found footage found in a basement. I guess, I mean I'm not really trying to walk around and say, "Hey, look how gritty it is!" It's your project. It all comes down to how to approach it and when we figure out how we're gonna approach it, then we can help you budget for it. - Sure. - I understand that that's a concern. I understand that it isn't so fun. - Yeah, yeah, but about that... - In the project... Realistically, how much can you afford? Realistically, I can't afford anything. This is an opportunity for us to get in like on the ground floor. This is a game changer. When you watch it, you will know. You're trying to get them to do this... For free, for zero, for a piece of the pie. We all know these conversations happen all the time and in the reality of it is that, as a business, there's got to be some kind of process that works for us that keeps our lights on - so to speak. - Oh, sure, sure. If I have to pay, I'm willing to go maybe $1,500. We could probably do about $2,000, but then it's gonna be a lot of ramen noodles. Most features that get full packages, even on an indie rate are anywhere from like 10 to 20. I can't leave here without them agreeing to do this. Alright, Feldman, just let me do the talking, OK? - Sure! - Cool! Thank you! - Hey, Dr. Wolfe? - Miss Crane. Hey, I know it's first thing early in the morning and everything, but we have something really awesome to show you for the documentary and it would be great... Wow, wow. Mr. Feldman, what's with the camera? I got this, Feldman. It's actually for the documentary. There's actually something that we need to show you. Hey, Feldman, are you rolling? Yeah. All this will become very clear in five seconds, but we are documenting this entire process. So, right at 1 a.m. this is what happened. - Hmm. - So? - Nicely done! - What do you think? An excellent effect! You guys have done a good job! No, Dr. Wolfe, this is not an effect, this is for real! This is not the project we talked about, but you've got a nice premise here, you've got something you can work with, you can turn this into a very sweet horror film. - We... - Just one second, OK? My camera it's about run out of batteries. OK, get the camera, please. OK, this is grey data, Dr. Wolfe. We need your advising right now, OK? This... ...psychodrama you're trying to do here and I respect, you're trying to be creative and all, but I'm very uncomfortable with you filming me. There would not have been enough time to put all these enhancements in it and everything else. This guy doesn't know what the hell he's doing. Take five, Feldman. Look, I would not put my good name on the line. Did you have that tape in your hands 24/7 from the moment that you walked away from that tunnel? Feldman is a slacker, he's in the seventh year of his six-year plan to get through school and, you know what? He's a genius. He's a genius when it comes to the camera and doing things with it. Well, I called Mr. Folklore and left a message on his machine, so I guess we should have talked to him first. Well, why don't we just go talk to him now? My big thing is how did anybody look at that footage and say that it's not real? That's what I'm saying. Obviously, we're still learning. Like, you just can't fake that. - Come on! - Anything? - No! - Awesome! I'm gonna check the side. Honestly, I feel a little weird about creeping in his window, but... This is a folklore guy, I'm sure this is the least creepy thing about it. Yeah. - Anything? - No! Shit! Now what? 1527? Oh, this is it, this is it, right here. You guys, this is the house. Oh, my God. Just like being in a dream, I can't believe we're actually here. It was undoubtedly through the Weird books that I have worked on for a good... It was about 7-8 years I was working on this series of Weird books and certainly in Pennsylvania and Maryland, this is what I'm best known for. - Mr. Lake! - Mr. York! - Call me, Gavin, please! - Gavin. This is the camera crew and everybody! Hi! Come on... Just don't pay them any mind, they're just gonna do their thing. - OK. - This place is great! I have to tell you, this is an absolute thrill, it's been about six months I've been studying this place. Wow, that's kind of unusual! Right here, this is it! This is it, this is the spot where you gave your interview. - I vaguely remember it. - Ten years ago! Yeah! I don't often have crews in my house. Yeah, Gavin sent me a message on Facebook and he told me that he found small footage of me, so I'm kind of interested to see the footage. Keep your eyes open for a long time because that's how you conjure him up. When he's right up there, the temptation is dead staring you in the face, you do anything you can to avoid him. Nice doorbell, Feldman. OK, wait a minute. Why are we doing it here and not at my house with the rest of the footage? Because I don't want to unplug the camera from the TV and I don't want to unplug anything, I can't lose, I don't want to go away. The last time we did it on your computer, we had the tapes in my camera, now it's in this, just let me do my thing right now, OK? I got the time codes written down. OK, but what are you doing? I just gotta show you. I gotta say this is a real treat for me. You don't have any idea how much you validate what I'm working on right now, which is really great. Just feed this up through your chain. So tell me about your role in the documentary. Oh, it was, it was minimal. The two people came, they got in touch with me, they came around and, yeah, we were here for an hour or so and then they, then they moved on. That was the last I saw them, just once. Sophia, Feldman. How did they get in touch with you? Email, was it phone, did they call you, did somebody, friend of a friend? I'm gonna tell you the truth, I don't remember. It was a decade ago. When you got in touch with me, I was... I searched my email archives and didn't find anything there, if it was the phone, then, you know, I don't keep phone records. So, is there a reason why Peeping Tom was excluded from Weird Maryland, obviously the Ilchester tunnel is in Maryland, any reason not to include it? It just wasn't as strong a story, I had that kind of a vibe about it that felt more like what we call fakelore rather than folklore. - OK. - I have a lot more stories than I have pages to... Alright, let's talk about the footage. I wasn't a part of it, you know, I just watched it for a few... Sure, but as an expert, let's get an authoritative kind of dissertation on that, if you will. That thing at the end of the tunnel with the... - Peeping Tom. - Peeping Tom coming in, it was a very striking image, it was iconic, it was an iconic image. Pretty scary. What about what happened next? Are you rolling on this, right? - Yeah. - Alright. What are you trying to show me? - Just watch. - OK. There, did you see it? OK, no. What am I looking for? - I'm gonna rewind. - OK. Alright. Look in the back on top of the building on the left. There, there! OK, so it's like a giant bird, right? No, it's not a giant bird. OK, what is it? What do you think it is? When I go to change the battery and I turn out and there! - Where am I looking? - There! Right there, next to the air duct. Wait a minute. But remember the spot. I'm gonna go forward. I remember, we turned it off and... OK, wait a minute, dude... This is as far as I've got. OK, come on, show me the other footage. - Alright, well... - You got me a little excited. Oh, I'm running, run, run. - Did you see that? - No! OK, OK, wait, wait! Play, play, alright. Get ready, ready, right there! - Oh, shit! - Oh, shit! Rewind, rewind! Ready, don't blink! - Here! There, see that? - That's right. - Got it! - Press pause! - Pause. - Bingo! Oh, right there. Oh, my gosh, dude, it's fucking Blinkman! Yeah, the thing is we're not the ones blinking, it's the camera that's blinking, so every time I'm making a new clip, he's there. Yeah, wait a minute! Every single time we turn the camera on and off and it blinks, he's almost, he's getting closer. Well, I had no idea I was being involved with a film of that kind, it was kind of scary, it was well constructed. So that was, so what we just watched, your opinion is that it's fake. That there's no Peeping Tom, there's no, they didn't find anything in that tunnel. - Yeah. - This is all? - It looked like... - All non-weird. - It's... - It didn't make your book. What I'm just trying to figure out is... Two human beings, alright, these are two people, you are the only link to them even existing and I called you, I explained to you how important you were. It just seems to me that you're not taking it as seriously as I thought you would. As an esteemed author would. You're kind of brushing it off a little bit, you live all the way out here, far away from anybody to be able to track you down. You don't have emails conveniently right after, right after they came and talked to you. "I don't remember who it was. I had a phone line that've been bouncing my service back and forth." Who does that? Nobody bounces their service back and forth. It just sounds to me like a lot of conjecture, sir. You wouldn't be involved in their disappearance, well then? - That's ridiculous! - Is it so ridiculous? Because it's, it's... I don't know, that was a documentary! It was a documentary. Were you gonna say stupid? No, I'm not gonna say stupid! I can find stuff that's pretty stupid. I mean, I know it's all that year, but... But it's well put together. Look, can we cut this please? I'm done, I'm done! Sorry! - Would you like to leave, please? - No! Miller's castle, I just don't understand why you're not... I just want you to answer whether or not these people exist or not. I can get out of here, I can validate this whole thing. - I'm done, I'm done! - Just seem awfully enough - weird to me! - Turn this thing off, please! So all he ought to fucking do... was to answer two goddamn questions. "Did he know who Sophie and Feldman were?" And: "Were they coming to make a fake horror movie or were they're legitimate documentarian filmmakers, looking to prove or disprove...?" Fuck! Hi buddy, how are you doing? You want to give your dad a hug? I missed you! Did you stay inside, did you see the rain? Can I get a hug, please? How did it go? It didn't go well, that's for sure. Why're you using my computer? Why is it your computer? It's got all my work on it! I've started the computer to do our finances. OK! - Alright! - Talk? We're talking right now. You know these guys are following me around, Mel, sometimes the story comes out. Let's go in here. Come on, we'll talk. Come on! We had another letter. - From the bank. - OK. - About our house. - Well, just take - the money out of savings. - We don't have savings! What about the budget that we talked about on Thanksgiving? Yeah, and then your movie happened. My movie. Listen, it's all gonna be worth it in the end, as soon as this hits, no more wedding jobs! This is it, this is what it takes, OK? There's always gonna be a tough time, alright? Isn't it gonna be great if we can sit back and we can say, "Carter, what happened?" Carter! Carter needs shoes. These guys in here right now, I don't want to get into this anymore. - Alright? We're done! - Yeah! We're done. Done! OK, so the camera was a test subject and stared without blinking for the entire hour, then according to the legend now sees Peeping Tom and every time it blinks, he gets closer. So, in other words, every time we turn it off and then on, or make a new clip. Yeah. There's our thesis, he's in our camera. My camera, and yeah, you know, first he's there in the tunnel, and he was there again when we met our adviser, and again when we went to see the author, and in each case, he got incrementally closer. But he's still hiding in the frame, he's making this a game, because no one will believe us, so we have to draw him out in the open. Why I feel you're not as excited about this as I am? Feldman, assuming this all really happening... It's really happening! Do you realize what this means? Yeah, it means we're filming him right now. OK, hey, turn it off, turn it off. Oh, what's your problem? My problem is that I'm still directing this and I don't want this camera on until we figure out what we're gonna do, OK? Turn it off! OK, so the camera's... what was that? Did you hear it? Yeah. It sounds like it's at the beginning of each new clip. It's a digital... Something to do with the camera, man, I mean it might be a messed up camera... Something to do with the camera. Alright, Feldman, just let me do the talking, OK? It's on every clip after the bridge section, so that's gonna be a lot of us going through every piece. Wait a second, every one after the bridge? So, as soon as Peeping Tom shows up, this sound shows up at the same time, is what you're saying. This is a little crazy, but it, it kind of, kind of looks like Morse code. Like, why would it only show up after the Peeping Tom? I don't know, you're the one that's got it documented. I'm just asking you, as a better person. - Documentary crew... - What do you think as a human being? Why would that show up like... I don't know, it's something that you want us to see. I do think, it's not you, man, maybe it's not even that you put it in there, maybe it's that these guys did when they shot this footage. This is a little crazy, though. What the fuck, shut the fuck up! What? What does it translate to? Say it out, say it out loud, please! - It says Blink. - Alright, can you guys do me a favor? Can you look at the camera? I believe that you've done a good job of... Can you look at the camera? I need you to authenticate this. - I need your help. - Authenticate it? Just stare in the camera and say what you just found for them. I think it's completely faked. Whoever shot the footage, these people that supposedly aren't around anymore, they clearly put this sound in there. OK, so maybe they did it, to so whoever... So if the guy gives the tape... whoever finds the footage and then uncovers this Morse code or this specific sound that happens every time. That's a lot of work, they would have had to shot the footage, offload it, edit it and put it back on DV tapes. Yeah, OK, well... - And then, and then... - He could have done that too. We don't know, man, we don't know where these tapes were before they came here. He's coming here and he tells us a story, then we either believe or we don't believe. Blink test, take one. Blink test, take two. Blink test, take three. Blink test, take seven. Blink test, take 13. Blink test, take 19. Blink test, take 25. Blink test, take 32. Blink test, take 40. I do not believe that this video is authentic. One thing that's really suspicious to me is that it always appears and disappears, like either off-screen or behind something. The one where the car goes past like that's just like another really common trick to use to make a ghost disappear if you're hoaxing a video. I guess here's two points about the blink test that seemed very suspicious. One is that Feldman steps in front of the camera every time he turned it on. The record button's on the back of the camera and it just seems like a convenient way to reveal the figure. Like they... I know making it black and white is a film student's stylistic choice, but it certainly makes it easier to hide effects and hide manipulation. - Let's talk about metadata. - OK. Alright, the metadata. There are timestamps that show the progression of events. You can fake that. You're accusing me of faking this whole thing. Look, I don't know you, I'm not gonna say that... No, but you'll take my money, you'll take my money, though. For my opinion, which I'm giving you. But we got the ghost group which isn't too bad, It seems like they were sort of your last resort. They were, but they have a lot of reach and if they believe in orbs... I mean, this is certainly a lot bigger, more real than orbs. And there you have it, folks, the footage, the found footage I've assembled for you today. With your help, we can figure out the mystery, together, and that's why it's very, very crucial you know, that you follow me on this quest. Any questions? No questions! Can I count on your support? Yes, ma'am. You don't know that they didn't have somebody to do this, you don't know if any of this is real, you don't know what they do... You're right, ma'am, and that's why we're here this evening, because if I knew if it was real, then I wouldn't need you, folks. If he's at the end of the tunnel and those are railroad ties, he'd have to be about six feet wide. Six feet wide. There's nobody in that video that you could find in public records to speak with? I did find this Matt Lake, he's an author of a book called Weird Maryland, which you can pick up if you want to, I mean I don't recommend it. I find it very hard to believe that people who come up in front of your group constantly get grilled like this, it seems to me that everybody be in, everybody be into it. I'd say this would be enough to warrant an investigation and a recreation of the experiment. Paranormal groups need more than just a piece of visual evidence to be able to methodologically quantify and qualify an event. We would need audio, we would need... Sir, sir, all the fancy words aside, I get what you're saying. All I'm asking you to do, is either believe it or you don't and you want to go investigate it or you don't. I'd like to know what kind of medications that you take? I, ma'am, I think that that's extremely rude and I don't think that has any bearing on that. I'd like to ask you what medications you're on to ask such questions? When you get a film on Bloody Mary, maybe we'll think about it, but this is a crock and we want nothing to do with it. And that's inspired ghost tracking. Now, we're not going out to investigate with you. I'm pretty sure that inspired ghost tracking... This is not gonna be the last time that you hear about me. Is this the exit door? No orbs out there, but thank you very much, I appreciate it. I'm sure that you'll be hearing from me in the future and yeah... Turn off the camera, please! I don't want to deal with it right now. And there he fucking is. Now, our problem is that any time that we moved the camera, whether we were just moving the camera or we were in a car or walking, he was able to flip in and out of the screen, so, we couldn't keep track of him, but if I leave the camera where it is, then he's stuck and I got it where I fucking want him! Now, what we really need to get right now, is we need to get the ending. Now, the most logical thing for me to think of is, you know, it's the closeups as a grand reveal. Why are you filming me with the Handycam? You're afraid of my camera. Well, that figures, I mean directors, you always had this vision and you think what you want to do with it, but behind the camera, you have no fucking idea! He keeps on getting closer and that's where he needs to stay. He's on my camera! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Hey, well, look... What are you up to with all these journals here? Wait a minute. That's some kind of OK, Butterfly Kisses, video diary, whatever, right. So, I don't really want to accuse Feldman of doing anything and I'm not even saying that he's lying, OK? I really do respect him. But after reading his diary a little while ago, and him having the diagrams of everything, I just want to record this for posterity and just make sure that everyone knows that I have my doubts about this entire project, OK? Right now, I have doubts about everything. Honestly, what could be worse? Knowing that Peeping Tom could come and get me at any moment or just being humiliated by the entire thing, knowing that Feldman can show this at the student film festival and I look like a fucking ass! I'm just gonna have to roll with it and hope the fella isn't fucking with me, like I'm really, really starting to believe. First off, you gave us the footage and we wanted to see all of those things that you cut out. Can you please tell us, can you tell us what Portraits of Dead Friends was? We actually ended up winning our student film festival, Best Feature Award for it. The same two filmmakers, Sophia and Feldman, made a movie called Portraits of Dead Friends in which they wanted to make a film about people who were deceased, but they didn't want to do the usual kind of, you know: "He was a wonderful person and he was born in such and such place." So instead, they went to the photograph that appeared with the person's obituary. Well, A. That has nothing to do with Peeping Tom. It has everything to do with Peeping Tom! I didn't want you to bring that on, oh my gosh! I'm glad you laughed at it. - I mean, I'm not good about it. - You seem pretty OK with it. Ok, look, the girl's sister didn't want to talk about her. It was a really good story, so we got a freaking actor in there, big deal. As documentary filmmakers, they were willing to have an actor play a person and accept award for it. Sure. Do you think Portraits was enough... - without that story? - What do you mean "Do you think Portraits was enough without that story"? There's five stories, what story? You know what story I'm talking about. Diana's? The one that we, you know... I'm not sure about Feldman, he's got a bit of an attitude, because he wants to be the director, he wants to be the top dog. Maybe there was some resentment going on there. I found a clip where Feldman is saying that he did not win an award, that it was just Sophia. What did you do with your award? I didn't get one. Wait, what do you mean, you didn't get one? I mean, Dr. Wolfe only gave it to you, and it only has your name on it! Are you serious? Feldman turns out to have his own mildly unscrupulous streak, because he starts to suggest, there are things we could do if we don't get the image that we're hoping to get. There's other things. Like what, like visual effects, kind of thing? Something like that. So we have then at least three possibilities here. We have the possibility that this whole thing is real, that they caught the image of Peeping Tom. We have the possibility of two of them got together, to put together this largely plausible hoax and we have the possibility that one of them put together a hoax on the other one. At least those three possibilities. I need to say... I guess my initial prejudice was the slacker who was kind of quiet in the background, was the X-factor, yeah, he was the instigator of the fiction Butterfly Kisses, video diary one. On reflection, it seems much more to me as though Sophia, she maybe crossed the line. You know, when you've invested a lot of time in a story and the deadline's coming up, the temptation is, yeah, how do I make this a good story? Unfortunately I can't prove that Peeping Tom wasn't anything more than just an actor and a hat. Which is kind of sucks, because I don't know what I'm gonna do from here. I guess, I'm just gonna need a new angle. And then, everything from that that point onwards was a collaboration in this fiction. It wasn't relevant to the story. What about the scene where they're standing in the old Ilchester Tunnel, and Feldman is saying if this doesn't work with the camera looking through the tunnel, we could do a special effect. I mean that's, I think that's desperate times and spitballing, you know, it's just talk, it's all loose talk. When someone wants, you know, just to speak their truth and to bring it out to other people and to kind of have that position of leadership and fame and everything else, they will cherry-pick certain things that support what they're doing. Your brain is not consciously cherry-picking, it is more of an unconscious thing. So, it's very easy for someone, as they're starting to get in to, you know, kind of an obsessive behavior or a delusion is starting to be created where the look at a piece of evidence and the things that highlight for them, they zoom and sink into the brain immediately and then the things that don't, the brain automatically kind of just sections them off like they don't even exist. Gavin York's decision to take that material out suggests a manipulative, a very strong manipulative intent on his part. If you're working with all these elements, you can, journalistically speaking, you can construct the... You run the story out of whatever footage you choose to put in there. If he took these scenes out, then he had a particular reason for doing it. Why he's allowing you to put them back in or to utilize them in some way, It's interesting. I mean, there's, there's... Pardon? - He signed a release. - Yeah. He authorized the use of the footage in this documentary. There, there are people who suggested that perhaps Gavin shot this himself. Do you feel that's... I don't think that's true. Simply because, when would he have done it? I mean, my mom found the tapes in the basement, so... Why do you own a Panasonic DVX100? - That's the camera that Feldman filmed the documentary on. - OK. They say he goes away on a lot of trips. Yeah, he goes where the weddings are. Does the money all match up? Usually! Stop! I want the tapes! What happened to your face? - It itched. - Are you on something? No, I thought the lashes would tick over the itch. And the camera, I locked it in the basement. I threw away the battery! And when I woke up from sleeping, it was back. It was taping me, he was taping me. Do you think it was me that pressed record for this? No, he knew you were coming, that's how I knew you were coming. I'm gonna get the ending that he aimed for before he does, but then it's all on you, you got the tapes. But I'm gonna get all the footage, you finish this movie like you said you would! Remember? And then he's coming after you. You're next. But you'll win another award! This is my new delivery system - Hello! - Hi there, I'm looking for Miss Joanne Tillman? She's not available right now, may I take a message? Yeah, this is Gavin York calling, this is actually the seventh time that I've called in the past three days. On Friday, when the timer runs down, from midnight to 1 a.m., viewers around the world will be able to watch footage, the found footage, and be able to make their own assessment of it. We're gonna get it out on the world, so... What's gonna happen after the 24 hours? The website's gonna be shut down, you're not gonna be able to see it anymore. What do you expect to happen then? The phone does never stop ringing after that. So you'll sell it to the highest bidder? Or one, just, you know, moderate. One, so yeah, yeah. I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to find out how I can speak with Miss Tillman and give her some information about a local community event that I've got going on on Friday. Hello... Hello! How many, how many newspapers in... All of them. - Already all? - All of them. And you see how it is? You heard it for yourself, they don't give a shit! Hang up, hang up! I mean, unless you... Do you know somebody? You know, we can't get involved. We have to stay on this side of the camera. Stay on that side of the camera if you want to, man. I mean, I don't know why you guys want to sit here and film me, and not get involved, because you're just wasting your time too. There's no ending to this movie whatsoever. You get an awesome ending for your movie, I get an awesome ending for my movie. Nobody's lying, nobody's saying anything fake, alright? All I'm asking for is one telephone number and a name. And that we can go, and we can speak to that person and we can put this whole story out there. I don't think... it's cheating if it's for the great reward. It's DC 101, I'm Mike Jones and in studio today I've been talking about this found footage all week, Butterfly Kisses. Gavin York, the guy that discovered this footage, and you could see it for yourself, if you haven't yet, Gavin York, how you doing, brother? I'm doing great, thanks for... I just don't understand the deal with this guy, man, why are you filming him, what's in it for you with this? It's supposed to be a really fantastic, fascinated character study. And then it is! Nobody wants to come to... Because this has been done a thousand times before. And we think it's a scam. I'm not the only one, it's everyone! I know, but that's the problem that I've got right now, I've got hours and hours of footage that we've shot, but we don't have an ending to this documentary. And you give me this opportunity to... - This is the... - This is amazing! It's alright, I got your back. - Just don't... - Alright. Alright, well, we'll see what the people have to say, it's 8669 1 DC 101. Hi, DC 101! Yeah, you actually think there's anyone stupid enough to fall for that? The video quality sucks, it's all fake. Gavin, do you have anything to say? Well, I mean, this would be something in 2004 to address with them! No man, you totally didn't do this in 2004, you did this just now. I didn't do anything in 2004, I just assembled it now. I'm not trying to profit off anything. Have you looked for them? Take it to the police... ...just check it out, that's bogus. Gavin, skepticism is just everywhere. - Yes, a lot of hatred out there. - A little bit, a little bit. Hang it up and find something else that you might be good at. Change yourself, because you're trying to profit off of somebody's death. You think that people are gonna fall for this. Showing a hoax it's... The second I spent watching that piece of... You seem like a stoner... ...whichever project... ...wrong about this, cursed... ...not real. Hello, DC 101, who's this? Stanley. Stan, what you gotta say to Gavin? Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll give him five minutes and I think I've got a guy, we can get my producer to call. It'll be good. See what happens. Good for him or? It'll be good for us. Gavin, listen, I know people have been blasting you. I want to... This is the call that we've been waiting for, let me bring him on here. - Hello, caller! - Yes. Hi, let me introduce you. Gavin, this is Ed Sanchez, the king of the found footage, the director of the Blair Witch Project who is calling to talk about your movie Butterfly Kisses! Ed, how you doing, brother? I'm doing well, man how's it going? - Good. - Good afternoon! Big, big fan! I've seen the footage. You know, it doesn't look completely genuine to me. You know, I think there's some acting involved, there's some effects involved, and I think that it's kind of disturbing that he feels that the only way to market this footage is to pretend it's real. So, you know, I just kind of had to speak out about it, you know? I understand where Gavin's coming from, but, you know, he's trying to, you know, get in the business, he's trying to make this film, but it's just been done before, it's a... Did you do this to start your career in Hollywood? Is this your way of maybe kicking that door open? I've been a filmmaker since I was about 12 years old. Right, that's why everyone's saying that this is not footage that is legitimate, that you created this on your computer. I completely understand that. And you've made this your film. You're a professional. Could you have made this on a computer at home with just a few projects? At least for me, as a filmmaker, you can tell that there's some stuff that is obviously, you know, manipulated. There's like these moments of... Where just the camera happens to be on, to capture a moment. That's like a big thing of found footage is like. The camera happens to be on while something crazy's happening, you know, you just don't have that kind of luck in life, you know. The whole legend is that the footage is found in a shoebox and the footage carefully shows like oh, here's this shoebox that we found it in here, I'll show it in front of the camera, which is like something that they're setting up the shoebox, you know. To me those are kind of, you know, signs that you're setting something up dramatically. In a movie you do that, you know. You know, after the initial buzz of our movie, we never pretended that it was real. I just have a problem with him thinking that it's for real. You know, maybe I think he has a problem. Ed, what are gonna be the consequences if this does come out and it's found out that Gavin made this up? You're just kind of really destroying your reputation with this, because eventually somebody's going to come out, some proof is gonna come out that this is not real, and, you know, people are gonna ask what were you thinking? And I'm kind of asking that right now, what is he thinking? You know, just fess up, you know what I mean or... I'm being about as honest as I can be about this. Alright, well, you say so. it's on until midnight tonight, thank you! DC 101! Mel? Hey! It's alright! Her mom set up an account. For Carter and they were putting money into it. And I took all the money and I spent it on the movie. How did she find out? She wanted to go and take out a sum. Authorities report that the strange death of a local man leaves more questions than answers this morning. Friends say that Feldman, a film student, had been acting strangely. Yeah, he's been making this movie with this... The body was lying on floor, smashed to pieces. Feldman's body had been found in the cabinet, under the kitchen sink. This creature is coming and... At this time, authorities await results of an autopsy. Hopefully we have a record with him this evening and, you know, figure out where he's been, if he's giving us a call, obviously we're, you know, we're showing up there to shoot, we're just filming this for posterity - at this point. - Yeah. I don't really think we're gonna use much about this, to be honest. Sure, I agree! You want me to keep rolling on this so that we have... Just whatever you do. I don't have a lot of battery left. If you're right about it. Alright! Gavin! Hey, Gavin! Gavin! I'm gonna stop recording for a second. No, no, just keep it rolling. No, what are we recording here? We're not doing anything, I don't... Go talk to him or something, man, this is getting... I don't even know what to say to him! I don't know, Erik, you're the director! Gavin! Look, buddy, we can't help you if you don't talk to us. It's not... Just when he gets closer to you... It's when you get closer to him... Wait, what are you talking about? Butterfly kisses! We need to help this guy, seriously. We call, we call his wife! We don't have her number. She changed her number. I don't know what her new number is. What about his, what about his mom-in-law? Whatever her name was. I never had her number. It worked through Amelia, and the house is sold, so I don't even know how to find her. I don't know, I mean, I'm not... We're supposed to make it a movie about him, and I don't know how much, if this is our responsibility, we're not, not his family. It is our responsibility now, we've... We've taken him this far, we've kind of screwed him over on a couple things! We haven't screwed him over, Kenny! But, DC 101 was total set up. DC 101 who's not a total set up, he agreed to it. He didn't know you were gonna have Ed Sanchez call him. Come on! I did not put him on the air to fail, we gave him that option. Look, it was mutually exclusive, mutually beneficial. We, we... We needed an end to the movie, and he needed a public forum through which to speak. We agreed on this. How is that, how is that my fault? - You guys, all said... - You ruin his life for your movie, how about that? At what point did this become my movie and this became I ruin somebody's life? Man, you just keep pushing him. You keep... Why do you guys, why do you guys keep showing up with the gear and shooting, what we're doing then? If you're so, if you have such moral issues with it, why are you fucking here? - Who's that? - What? Somebody's running across the tracks. - Come on, guys. - Shit! Where is the camera? Did he take the camera? Guys, slow down. - Did he seriously go in there? - I'm not going in there. Guys! The camera battery is getting low! We have to make a decision here. Gavin! The camera is about to die, Erik! What are we doing? - What is that? - What? - Who the fuck is that? - Gavin! - Did you see? - It's right there. - Did you see anything? - I don't see anything! It's right in fucking the end of the tunnel! What the fuck is...? Feldman sent this the night that he died. As you can see, he details out what he called the final plan. At the end, he only had three blinks left, so he set the camera up into a mirror, so he covered both sides, the front and the back of himself. He crouched down in front of the mirror and had this hammer ready, so that on his final blink he could stop, he could stop him from getting him, so he thought... Feldman's parents let me go over and go through everything when Feldman had passed, because we were working on the project together. I was able to get this tape which was in the camera, up until the end. As you can see, it's all cracked up and the tape was unspooled, but I was actually able to put it back together. It took a few days, but I did it. The only thing that would play, was the last clip, and that's OK, because Feldman was smart. He also had this. Ah! Alright, so Andy, for the benefit of the camera, can you please, can you please tell me what you sent me in the email? Well, what I found was, if you look when Peeping Tom is jumping up, like jumping up to grab Feldman... If you look in his eye, there's actually an image in his eye. At first, I thought it was the shot of the, like the Ilchester tunnel, like I thought it was like a frame grab from the video where he appeared, but I actually think it's the other way around, like it's what Peeping Tom saw when Peeping Tom appeared so he's looking through the tunnel and... you see the lights from that camera and beyond that is like the train bridge. OK, so this, this is his POV of Crane and Feldman filming him the night... It's Peeping Tom's point of view, yeah. Wow, ah... So this is what it sounds like by itself. You wouldn't necessarily be able to tell that that's Morse code, but you can see that it looks a hell of a lot like it. So, we, last time we were working with Gavin, there was kind of some debate over the sound that we found at the beginning of... seems like each clip after the bridge footage. Using this synthesizer sampler from iZotope, called Iris, you can basically feed it the sound and it'll map out the frequencies and amplitude of the sound visually. So, when I called you guys in here, I was actually thinking that Gavin would be in here, as well. He's the director and yeah, I would have thought he would want to see this, it's pretty crazy, kind of validates him, but... Gavin have been missing for nine days. Huh! Alright, so, OK. Are you rolling? - Yeah! - OK, so, on the way over here, before I left this arrived in the mail, this is from Gavin. I have not opened it up because I wanted to wait until we do this on camera. Ready? - Yeah. - OK. Alright. DVCAM. - What is that? - Holy shit! This is, this is... Sophia Crane, this is from the found footage. This is the package that Feldman sent her. No kidding! This is... OK, alright, look, either this is a prop or... Oh, fuck, how did he get this? Because that was the... and then the stuff that Sophia found with the, you know, she was like storyboard, storyboard, concept art. - This is gotta be fake. - Where is it coming from? - I don't know. - I thought it was Gavin. Gingo Corp's not even showing up on the map, anywhere in Maryland, there's a Gringo Court! Coincidentally. Of course, it's the Ginkgo Court. What the fuck is Gringo? Because... Hey, look, I mean, sometimes they change communities, they change the street names... - Is anything else in there? - Yeah. See, here's his journal, so maybe it tells what he's been doing for the past two weeks. I don't know. This is a motel key card. - Are you rolling? - Yeah. A lot of survey by... Fucking, what's going on? Gavin! Is the management guys still... Good, let's go in! I don't think we should record in here. We're not breaking in, are we? Yeah, right. Oh, shit! Gavin! Jesus, it's not good! The hell is this? - Kenny, Kenny! - What? - The GoPro's on. - Jesus! What you think he's doing? What the fuck is this? Recording it. Here's his camera, there's no card inside it. Does anybody see the Panasonic, the DVX? The tapes? Everything OK? OK, cool. Put this in the car, we'll take these with us. - Shit! - OK. Fuck, dude! Let's get out of here! Let's go, let's go! What's wrong? I don't know, seriously! Oh, fuck, dude! What is it, man, what's in there? I suggest to start from the beginning with what happened. OK, so, we're making a documentary. Is that on? Are you recording it? - Yes. - OK. Go ahead. We're making a documentary about the deceased. Carl, where's the footage? Where are the tapes? In my car. Do you think, should we show the police the footage on the camera and everything? - No, no. - Why not? They might take it away. They'll take the tapes, they want the tapes, they need the tapes. The tapes, look, the tapes in the shoebox have absolutely nothing to do with what happened here. Nothing to do with it, and we already have a real scene, we can use the footage. I'm talking about the footage on my camera that we just shot, shouldn't we show that to the police? Yeah, but, if we show that to the police it'll show that Carl found the tapes and then they'll take the tapes. What do you think he was doing, all the GoPros and all the camera stuff, like, what... I don't know, I think the more important question is who took the cards? Who? They're not in the cameras... - So we'll find out in ten years! - What? That's when the footage will be found! I went to bed early last night. I was so tired, kind of like you are right before you're getting sick. I dreamt I went to the tunnel and I was staring down, right at midnight. Everyone says it's so hard, but I thought it was so easy. And when I stared for an hour, he appeared and then I woke up and I realized it wasn't a dream! It's ten miles from my house and I don't know how I got there! Alright, I'll tell you about this tunnel... Oh, fuck! Let's be honest here, this is not what we thought this was going to be, and now we're trying to make something out of it. Listen, not all documentaries, not all projects come together. This is one of those examples, it just didn't, it didn't pan out. So you're saying we don't have a compelling story to cut together here, we don't have... There's, there's no end to this story other than us standing here on the tracks. There's no end of this story because it's all, this is the beginning. - You understand? - What? We have the tapes, right? Then there's what Studio Unknown found, OK? They found that sound anomaly. We didn't put that there, Gavin didn't put that there. With what Wardlaw found, OK, with the reflection in the eye, and I don't know we put this documentary out there and other people can take it to the next step! - This is just the beginning. - You're contradicting yourself! - I'm not contradicting myself! - You just said we're not trying to present us like a real story, and now you are trying to present it like this. I am trying to present this like the real story of what happened to Gavin York. And because we're trying to tell Gavin's story, these component factors that are included in there are part of his story, part of what happened to him. I'm not saying it's real, I'm just saying that what kind of a fucking idiot just drops it! Erik, do you believe that the Blinkman is real? My name is Sophia Crane. It's March 3rd, 2004. I'm a film student and this is my senior thesis. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be alive, so I ask whoever find this, please apply the first and second halves of this final interview to the beginning and end of my film. I don't know where to make the cut. This is the story of Peeping Tom and how I went looking for him. Please show this to my parents. I don't know how much longer I can go without blinking, but I think I found a way to beat him. The girl who stared into the sun she only lost her sight, she still had to blink. Everyone blinks. It's right here, taunting me, try one last thing. They say you can't cheat Peeping Tom. But I think I found the way to beat him at his own game! Subtitles by explosiveskull
