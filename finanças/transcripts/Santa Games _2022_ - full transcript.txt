Mm, these are good. Mm-mm-mm. Mm! Mm. Looks like Santa's got a sweet tooth. Did you pay for those beignets? What are you, the beignet police? You know I didn't get that job. Look, guys, let's have fun today, okay? If the kids wanna buy a picture, it's okay, but don't push it. You don't have to push it down their throats. Fun, fun, fun! Fun, fun, fun! What is our word? Fun. - What? - Fun! Fun. See you out there. Um, Santa Charles. Wait! Slow down, Santa, these are new! Are you hiding? Can you see me? Is Jesus black? Santa, go to the office. Denise wants to see you. She said, tell Santa Charles... Tell Santa Charles what? Santa, she wants to see you in her office. Shh, you didn't see me. And that's not sexy. This is sexy, and you are hard to miss. That's a fat joke. You're a little plump. - Mm-hm. - Not a fat joke. I'm not the only big guy here. Thick is the new word. - Yeah. - Two C's. What about Big D? Big Douglas over here. No one ever makes fun of Big Douglas. He's a security guard. He's bigger than me. - Not my ministry. - Mm-hm. Still making fun of big people. We need to get together a rally around big people. Get us a flag. A saying. Yo, you bigger than everybody. You go ahead and knock him up, man. Go and do what you need to do. I ain't bigger than you. Santa Claus! Whoa! - For me? - Yes, Sir. Merry Christmas, everyone! Who's been naughty and who's been black? Santa! Hey! Boo! Who wants to talk to Santa? Oh-oh! Feliz Navidad! Oh, moo! Feliz Navidad, bueno! - Bueno! - Hey, hey! Boom, Emily! Let's get some music going on around here. Merry Christmas, everybody! Let's get this party started. Santa! Merry Christmas. Hi, Santa Charles! - Hi, Janet. - You know my name? Name! Last year you wanted a detective outfit with a magnifying glass. The year before that, you wanted Jeff's friends and a unicorn. What do you want this year? I'll do my best. Oh and, Santa, one more thing. Yeah? Do you need Jesus? How about a picture with Santa? Say Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! I want a Ps5, zero gravity laser race car. It climbs walls. And if you can't fix the ozone layer, even just a little bit, that would be great. And also- How about we take this picture? Say Christmas presents. Incoming! I thought you'd stop by my office on one of your breaks. Well, technically, I'm still on break, I... I heard about the incident. The guy was 300 pounds. I think he was 30. We don't discriminate. Hmm? Discriminate? I'm, you know, he's a big guy. Why can't you be a team player? - I am a team player. - That's not a team player. Most teams protect their quarterback. He was a paying customer. Santa is his best friend. Santa is his hero. And all heroes should be able to sell honey to a bee. Heroes get the job done. Did you know a hero is also a sandwich? I like mine with some relish. Maybe some mayonnaise. You had a quota to make. - I like- - You sell what? Hm, any idea? Hm? Hm? I've the numb, the, the, I don't have the paper. The numbers haven't came in. The numbers came in. We sold a couple hundred. Whoa! That's what I'm talking about. No, that's not what we're talking about. Whoa! - Keep it down, the kids. - Up top. Is that some kind of record number? No, that's a failure! You sold a couple hundred photos a day and yet you spend hundreds of hours with thousands of kids. You ask them about their lives, their lists, their favorites. But you won't ask them to take one stupid photo. Kids want Santa to listen to 'em. You want their tooth fairy money? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! I want all of it, Santa's bigger than the tooth fairy. Right! Right. Right? Right, that's why he doesn't need any money. Yeah. If I look like you, oh, mm, I'd have them eating out the palm of my hands. Is that a fat joke? Let me explain something to you. I am Santa Legacy. Hm. Okay? 25 years, me in, okay? My daddy was Santa Claus. His daddy was Santa Claus. His daddy, well, not his daddy. Okay, your daddy and your daddy's daddy and your daddy's daddy on top of that don't pay these bills. Do your job. Well, maybe his daddy's daddy was a Santa Mall, not a mall 'cause they didn't have malls. I believe in you. I believe in your bigness. Huh? Leave. You get the point 'cause I've been doing this a long time. Woo! I'm getting too old for this sled. You know you can't drown your problems in snickerdoodle and milk, right? Thanks for letting me stay here, Unc. It's only temporary, man. Just until I get back on my feet. You know, we don't mind you staying here. It's always a home, but we got some rules. First, no lips to carton. That's direct contact. Don't do that. Don't let your aunt see you do that. But we're family. That means that's your milk now. Yeah, 'cause this is what you use around here. No, it's too late, it's too late. I thought you wanted some. No, why would, with lips to carton! It's not in the carton no more. But your lips, son. Your lips, huh? All right. And the cookie situation here. We want you to be comfortable. You know you can stay with me and your aunt anytime you want, okay? But we gonna have to ration out these cookies. Aunt Carol said I could have some. She said one. You don't have to eat nine at one time, son. You can have a cookie every once in a while. You look like Rick Ross if he like cookies. There's the smile I was looking for. That's the guy I'm looking for right there, man. Listen, everything's gonna be all right. You're gonna get you a new apartment. I just wish I could commit to something. I just can't commit to anything these days, man. Well, you know what, you should just start out by committing to this, a glass. Now that's your milk. Your lips have been on it. And that's your glass. Are you full on cookies? ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ I wish Charlie Wilson was my uncle. What's that, what did you say? What did you say? Nothing, nothing. Huh? Leave me alone, Uncle Charles, man. I call Goofy and Gaffy elf to come here and sock your Rick Ross looking ass. ♪ Up on a housetop reindeer pause ♪ ♪ Out jumps good old Santa Claus ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney, with lots of toys ♪ ♪ All for the little ones' Christmas joys ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Up on the housetop, click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with good old Saint Nick ♪ ♪ First comes the stocking of little Nell ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Santa fill it well ♪ ♪ Give her a dolly that laughs and cries ♪ ♪ One that will open and shut her eyes ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪ Well, fellas, another day. What happened? Who shot Rudolph? Santa Charles? My office. It's not gonna be a good morning. Please have a seat. I told you once, I told you twice, I'm not gonna retire till I'm in the dirt. You're resilient and I appreciate that. But I have a business to run, a new, updated, modern Santa experience business. Your contract is up at the end of the season. So I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you. Denise. I've decided not to renew. Denise. Slow down. I thought you would like retirement. Come on, no! Are you kidding me? Oh no, I guess you wouldn't. But Patrick, Patrick, he comes highly recommended. Patrick? Mm-hm. A white Santa in a black mall. Are you, it would be chaos around here. - I- - It would be, oh! Did you see the "White Bikini Wives"? I did, but that has nothing to do with this. If you hired the ghost of Christmas past, these people will lose their minds. It's like playing Paul Anchor at a family reunion. - Okay. - You can't do that. - I don't see why. - You need the old days. Well, the kids will love him. It's good enough, and apparently he loves having his photo taken. You know, I like my Santas amenable. - Amenable? - Amenable. Bottom line, it works. He works, it works. You can't... listen to me. This has been a black Santa Mall since 1948. My grandfather sat a little white child right here smiling and people took a picture. Nobody said nothing. That's my legacy. That's who I am. - Look. - We break down barriers. I can appreciate that. I can appreciate that. I know this is some kind of tradition for your family. You've broken all kind of barriers, I get that, but I'm doing you a favor. - What! - This is a physically demanding job, and I can see. Woo-woo, well, say it, say it! Say fat! I didn't say anything about fat. - You was about to say fat. - I was gonna say tired. - Say it. - You're tired. - Ah. - You're tired. - Ah. - You're tired. And if you had any kids of your own to pass the baton. Look, I've made my decision. I'm running up the flag pole, it's done. You said tired instead of fat. Nobody digs your music but you. You are affected. Santa Charles, you need to write in your journal or take that up with your therapist. I'm telling you what I need. My bottom line is suffering because of your incompetence. Now, here's the deal. After this season, you're done. No, no, no. We're getting I just need some time. No. - No, no, no, no, no. - No, absolutely not. No, no, no, listen to me. Hear me out. Let me find my own replacement. Groomed the way you like it. - You're funny. - No, no. You picked the wrong profession. You probably should have been a comedian. I groom a hand-down, I teach, but it's with your rules. Let me go out with some dignity and then I'll retire. Is that a promise? Yes. You told me Santas don't make promises. They do now. All right. Tell you what, you have until the end of the season to find me the best Santa for the job. Game on. Well, let's shake on it. Let's not shake on it. Let's remember this moment. Okay. You're a good friend. Okay, go. Have you ever heard of the heat miser? You kind of look like her. Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you. - Thank you. - I'm not gonna let you down. - Got it. - Okay? Keep it heavy. Understood, great. Hey, the name is Orlando. And next time you're in this mall, just ask for me, baby. You'll never wait in line again. I'm telling my dad. I'm telling my dad too. Kids. Great. Merry Christmas, Ju. What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh! First time in a black mall. I know how you feel. Barbecue smell, greens, cornbread. I know what you want for Christmas. You wanna be able to do this. Back at you, Ju. What do you want this year? A turtle. You're getting too old for the sled. Ah, seriously. Ah! Ugly Christmas sweaters. Ha-ha-ha, this is my design. Sites like these steal indie ideas all the time. Make a few changes and resell the imitations as their own. You're really leaving, huh? Not if I can help it. You're really good at this. I feel you, and I'm a 100% on board. Gimme the details. What's your target demo, level of experience, personality type? Mm-hm! Through datish. But you know. Okay. Do you want me to put a competitive salary? Ooh, can grow a beard naturally. You get a bit aggressive. Be aggressive, be aggressive. Should I set the parameters to worldwide? Ooh! I don't even know what you're talking about. Okay, what else do you want? - Video. - Oh, I'm good at videos. - Really? - Mm-hm. Anything else? Those yellow things with expressions. Oh, smiley face. - Emojis. - Ah! We just got black Santas last year. Really? Whoa, lit! We lit, we lit! Period, purr! - Purr! - Purr. - Purr. - Yes. Knock, knock. I'm saying, never mind. Different era. Purr! Charles. Mm? Mm? I'm not asleep. I'm just reading my eyelids. - Right. - Mm. Ooh, uh-oh. Somebody wants something. Mm? Who me? I know when you get all squirrly and touchy like this, you want to say something or you want something. Mm-hm, you all right? I can't figure out what to do and what should I do? You've been putting it off for a long time and we both knew this day would come, right? - Mm-hm. - But I think retirement is going to be good for both of us. - Retirement? - Yeah. I mean, think about it. Now, we get to stop putting off that trip to Edinburgh. - Edinburgh. - Come on, it's been years we've been talking about it. - Edinburgh? - Yes! Are you saying it right? I'm saying it right. - Edinburgh. - E-D-I-N. S-A-N-T-A-I-N. Are you trying to say Eaglewood? No baby, no. What Edinburgh? - Edinburgh, we do, baby. - No, no, no. Black people. Yeah, we're black. Mm-hm, we'll be there. - Why go to Edinburgh? - Do something different, honey. Let's go to Alabama too. Mm, awwh, but I wanna see the Christmas markets, big papa. But that's why they have the internet. In person and on Christmas. Edinburgh? Yes. My God, you can't hate me because I'm not being Santa Claus. I mean, I'm doing my due diligence. Baby, you can sit in this chair all day and all night doing your due diligence. Well, look, if we not gonna go to Edinburgh, can you do me a favor? Just go talk to Clarence, hmm? Listen, the boy's went through a rough patch. He don't even like Christmas. He's not a holiday person. You're right, all right, but look, he needs purpose. Hmm. And you just might be able to change his mind. See, there he go. I know you was up to something. Oh, I'm always up to something, big Papa Santa. Um. Mm, come on. You tricked me again. Oh, yes. Well, you better, you better give me some purpose. Talk to Clarence, baby. Mm-hm. In case you forget, his room is right here. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Hey, Unc, what's up? I know this is a dumb question, but are you busy tomorrow? No, man, I'm just trying to piece my life back together. Yeah. Why don't you take a break and come with me to work? You done with interviews? Yeah, nobody wants this job. I'll be doing this till I'm dead. Oh man, Uncle Charles, you ain't gonna die. You gonna live forever like the Rio Center. That's what I thought. But I think you should come to work with me. The kids will cheer you up, man. They enjoy it too. Okay, okay, I'll go, whatever. - Yeah. - Take a shower. Yeah. But I'm not wearing a costume. It's not a costume. It's a uniform and you're not that cool. It's a costume. The snickerdoodle cookies are disgusting. Ooh, Holy North Pole. The IRS will never catch me. Time for more video. Hmm. What the? Oh my God. Oh my God. Hello, my love. Oh, my little vanities. I'm Vaingirl 21. Thank you for logging in. No! Not Vaingirl 21. But y'all, my friends sent me this video earlier and I was cracking up. You have to see this. This is Santa Charles for the ultimate- - I'm so fired. - I've never heard of the- - How am I gonna afford my clothes? This had me rolling. Look at him. Why is that kid doing that to him? He started doing this crazy dance like this. He was doing this little roll with it. I don't know about that. We're gonna have to like, make it a little cuter. Ooh, I like that, okay. Come on, Vaingirl 21. We're gonna make this into a hashtag. Mall santa hashtag Ultimate Santa Challenge. Oh, hashtag Ultimate Santa Challenge! You guys wanna do it with me? And we gonna roll it and we gonna do the Santa belly with it. I'm so fired. Okay y'all, so make sure you do the dance hashtag Ultimate Santa Challenge. And when they're picking the next mall Santa, we gotta show up. - Oh, no, no, no! - Does anyone wanna do a meetup with me? Okay, thanks. So I'll let you guys- Oh my gosh. Not Vaingirl 21! Oh God. Breathe, Terrell. Woo-sah! Vaingirl 21! Oh my God, you guys, look at all of these people. You are logged into Vaingirl 21. Okay, so as you can see, guys, I'm not the only one to make it out to the mall to check out the Ultimate Santa Challenge. And you like my fit? The Ultimate Santa challenge is to choose the next mall Santa. And as you can see, there are all types of Santas here. Ready, suit, select. But you guys I heard the OG Original Santa is ready to retire. But he's ready pass on his baton to the next Santa. However, do they look this good? And can they do this? Hey, come on and play with me, baby. Come on down to the mall today. Hashtag Ultimate Santa Challenge. Me been waiting for this now. You have no idea me dream of being a Santa Clause. Now, I'm gonna trust you to make this special juice 'cause me got to go. Oh, me ah gonna be a Santa Clause. Yeah, man! Right! - Rastafari! - Yeah. Emma, right? Yeah. Is there anyone that can help us out here? We just wanna sign up, Emma. I mean, I've been here with Joseph and Charles and Kiki and Dashaun. Yeah, Denise, can you? You must be in charge, Denise. Elizabeth will take great care of you, okay. It's Emma, why does everyone keep calling me, okay. - Miss Denise. - Um, okay. Um, guys, uh, no, Santa Charles will be here soon and you guys can just talk to him. What in the? Orlando! We are upon a red light security for this crowd out here, right? I could use an extra pair of hands and a barricade and a small tank. We're not under siege. Not yet. You got pepper spray? - Mm-hm. - Okay, good, good, good. Use it if you have to, but only if you have to. And never on the kids. No, no, no, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Copy that, Big D. Don't call me that. Ooh, you're right. Inappropriate. Very! ♪ Merry Christmas and Happy New Year ♪ Wow! How amazing! Terrell, why are you bumping around like some lost duck? The post went viral. Apparently, we were too aggressive, too too aggressive. It was picked up by at Vaingirl 21. She has over 20 million followers on Vid Feed. Way more than Diamond Dave. Oh my God. Yeah? Diamond Dave. Yeah, yeah, when posting. People are getting sick all the time when they go viral. I forgot to refresh the page. I know. Yeah, we'll refresh it later. We'll refresh the page later and call Diamond and get the disease handled. I'm so fired. No, not, it's 'cause you've got the people viral and the people, the fresh, the viral page. What is he talking about? Unc, going viral means basically the whole world seen it. What? Before you say anything, let me explain. - Please do. - It's gonna be the one because I think I should be the one. Explain. Um. We did what you asked and we went wide, woo! - Uh-huh. - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. - Even went viral. Is that why it looks like a Santa convention exploded outside of my mall. Maybe we went too wide? - Yeah. - We can make an announcement over the intercom and send the store Santas packing. No, no, no, no, no. This is good. This is exactly what we needed. Hmm? There's a lot of Santas out there. We're bound to find someone we both like and can move forward with. Hmm. Well. But those aren't real Santas. Yeah. They're viral. - He learned that word. - They didn't refresh. Right? I'm keeping an open mind, Santa Charles. Are you? Yeah, but I'm just saying that they're viral Santas. Okay, so what's the plan for the interviews? There's a lot of folks out there and, from the looks of them, they'll be competitive. That sounds cutthroat. Oh, I know, I know. Something, something's in the air. I imagine a bunch of Santas trying to ruin each other for likes and for a chance of the coveted Santa Mall job. Mm, it's definitely not covered by insurance. It could be a multi-day task. And we could hold interviews in the parking lot and I could start a signup sheet to get an accurate head count. Hey! Okay? - I got it. - What? Judge. What did you say? You wanted a Santa Claus that would be what? Ame... Amenable. Yes! I couldn't remember that word, but listen, we have a challenge. They have to be up for the par. They have to do things, obstacles, and flippedy-flip and whippedy-whip. That's what we call the amenable Santa challenge! Okay, so, so what are you thinking? That's all I got. Werk! Oh, oww! Who falls asleep in a sauna? What you want, man? How did you find a sauna? I found one. Follow me. Where are we going? Less talking, more walking boy. You didn't find a gym, did you? What are you doing? - Shh! - Man, you acting weird. What is this? Some kind of Santa experience initiation where you teach me how to duck cookies effectively? Listen, I'm not supposed to do this, but I want you to be Santa Claus. Only problem with that is I don't want to be Santa. Man, I just came to spend some time with my favorite uncle. Very interesting word. Time. I'll say you spent a lot of time in prison. Here we go. Your PO's not playing. He's very serious. If you become Santa and allow him to see you in a different light, you understand that, you're helping children. I saw how children see you, when they see you, their faces light up. There's something about this suit once you put it on, it kind of erases your past. You become something new. You have a purpose. Uncle Charles? No. You think you're the only criminal in the family, don't you? No. Let me show you something. See that? That's my father, your grandfather, and his father, my grandfather. Do you know what my grandfather did for a living? He was a bootlegger from Chicago. They called him Big Draws. Do you know what they called your grandfather? What? Poon Daddy. He was a con artist. We all had a past. They put on a suit and erased their past. They started giving. I even have a past. I used to be a gymnast. Now that's criminal. Especially if saw me in them tights. My point is, put on a suit, it gives you a purpose. You got it. Uncle Charles, I don't want to be Santa. As a kid, this is all you ever wanted to do. I was eight. Of course, I thought this was the coolest job in the world. You're a fat man in a red velvet suit and nobody judges you. But then I grew up and I realized that all you do is pedal dreams and wishes to little kids. It's not real. None of this is real. That's what you think I am? Fat man in a red suit. This is real. You're real! Uncle Charles, there's a thousand other guys out there that like to play dress-up just like you. You don't need me. But they're not real! And they're not you. They're from Instatake. Face. The thing with the bird. Instaface, Unc. You know what I'm saying? They're insta, influencers, man. I love you. But you gotta understand that not everybody gets what they want for Christmas. You of all people should know that. I do. That's not what you get. It's what you give. Whatever man. I got bigger fish to fry and bigger problems to solve. So I'm gonna find me something to eat. And I guess I'll find my own way home. Now when you say you gonna find your own way home, do that mean you're gonna steal a car? No. Where'd you get that robe from? Hey. I think I'm lost. Okay. And where are your parents? I don't know. They're probably worried. Where's your family? Santa Charles is your daddy? Uncle. Mom and dad are gone. You are so lucky! I wish I had an uncle Santa. I guess he's not so bad. Gosh, there you are. I was so worried. Thank you. No problem. Come on, let's go. We're live, action! Are you Santas ready for a challenge? Yeah! I said, are you Santas ready for a challenge? Yeah! The Ultimate Santa Challenge. Yeah! I'm your host, DJ Snowbiz. And this store is your playground. We also have souvenirs. We have hats, shot glasses, snow boats, novelty towels, T-shirts, miniatures, and various water packages available for purchase, okay? There will be three days of Santa Games. And at the end of the game, we'll crown our next mall Santa. But you don't have to take my word for it because Santa Charles is here to let you know that he's been making a list and checking it twice. And at the end of the games, he will decide whose been naughty or nice. Ah, first of all, I'd like to thank you guys and welcome you to the Santa Games. This is not a job. Hm? It's an honor and a privilege. This is not a suit or a costume. It's a uniform. I'm proud to wear it. Some of you guys know this, some of you guys don't. A part of a legacy here, three decades sitting in that chair right there. A grandfather, a father. But this is not about being a mall Santa. It's about listening and love. Love for the job, love for the people, love for the community. I remember you, Stacey Howard, wanted a firetruck. Kids, they don't get everything they want, but they do get to see a Santa Claus that looks like them. Hmm? So welcome to the first annual Santa Games. Come on, Santa! Come on, Santa! Can I help you? It's not what it looks like. Mm, looks like you're stealing from Santa. What are you doing then? Borrowing from Santa, without his permission. You lose a bet or something? Worse. I think I just found my Christmas spirit. In the storage closet? Is that where I left it? Oh, you know, I never could find the hats in the midst of all that other stuff. See here. Your uncle is going to be so pleased. Please, don't tell Uncle Charles. Okay. I want to do this on my own. If it's in my blood, my family legacy, then it's meant to be. But if not, and I fail at this too, then at least Uncle Charles won't have to get his hopes up. All right, I won't say a word. Okay? But I do think he's gonna know. I just have a feeling. He'll know. Can you help me with this beard? I thought you'd never ask. All right. Let's see, oh yeah, first you gotta take this net off. Put your head down. Mm-hm. Awwh. Behind those ears. Yup. Hold on. Can you breathe? Just. Ho-ho-ho. So proud of you. Next. Next. So, I'm, I'm really sorry about that. Thank you. Thanks. All right, first and last name, Santa. Thank you. Tell us your name. My name is Stephanie. Wah gwan, me name Wayne. You know, straight from Jamaica, boi-boi! Hi, I'm Adam. Hi, my name is Clyde. My name is Nick. And Nick, why do you want to be Santa Claus? Wait, wait, hold on. Who are you? Who are you to be asking me questions or what was, what's happening right now? Me want to be Santa Clause and I'm come here to show Santa can be everywhere, yuh know. I'm here for one reason. Total world domination. Did it, and now he's on the elf team. Oh, oh, mum, mum, mum! Come on, our boy is on TV! Come fast, fast, fast, fast! So, basically. Welcome to day one of the Santa Creators. All right, and we're back with what looks like hampers of Santa's dirty laundry. I wonder what we're gonna do with that? Can't hear you. But if you guessed wash and fold, you're wrong. This game is called Santa's Pajamas. When I count to three, you'll race to the hampers and grab a matching pajama set. We have elf, gingerbread and snowman. Options are limited. So choose wisely. And go! Oh wow. Illegal contact! There's no fighting in the North Pole. We have jammies for everybody. Oh shirt! Try out? Try out? What? You don't think there's a need to try out? I don't think there's a need to try out when you find what it is that you're looking for and it's sitting in the chair. I am a fat man in this hot... How does he do this? Oh, Santa Charles. I know of him. Right, what do you know of Santa Charles? Cool dude. Now it's time for the one, the only, Santa Charles. Good afternoon, Santas. Please try to separate in the most scientifical ways. Gingerbread to the left. Elves in the middle. Snowmen to the right. The losing team will, unfortunately, be kicked out of the games. If you don't have a costume on, bye-bye. Oh, can I tell them Designs by Terrell? Designs by Terrell. Take a picture, it's gonna last longer, mm-hm. And, again, if you don't have a costume, off you go. Listen, you guys all did a good job. See you day two. Good night, have a good night, guys. We'll see you back here bright and early tomorrow morning for day two. Thank you. Got the pizza guys. Oh. Look who I found roaming the halls like a lost little puppy. And look, he doesn't have his beard on. Hi! Hey, I hope you don't mind, we couldn't decide on what topping to get. So we just got cheese. Yeah, and they got fruit punch, ginger ale, energy drinks and water. Or if you're feeling brave, I make a mean protein shake. I'm nicknaming Santa's Ultimate Challenge. I don't think I have any competition, but to be honest with you, there's one particular one on my team. Are they gonna hear this? Okay, cool. So there's one particular Santa on my team. Nick. Buff daddy, Big Santa. He's just always angry and wants to hit people. The 'Roid Ranger. I think it might be something in his protein shakes. I think he taken some of the ting. He needs to slow it down. It's not healthy for your man beat. You know what I'm saying? But then some of the other ones, you know, they all right, you know. Day one done. Yeah, you know, we started off a little rocky, you know. But you know what, mate? We got it done, we edged it out. You know what, I think day two's gonna be a doozy. I mean everything that went through with the PJs, but you two look a little intense. This man. Are you scared? No, but you should be. Ooh. I'm just glad I found a shirt that could fit me. I actually found the shirt, and you're welcome. Yeah. You know what, it was a little crazy. You guys think the rest of the challenges are gonna be like that? Nah, man, me don't think so.

I guess I won't tell you that the first challenge is a Santa trivia game. I appreciate you for not telling me that. Is there anything else you don't wanna tell me? I'd love to, but I can't. You shouldn't. I definitely shouldn't tell you that the second challenge is a guessing game involving Santa Charles' favorite cookie. But that's all I know. When I become queen of this store one day, maybe you and I should go grab lunch or something? Merry Christmas. Oh, oh! Do you have any kids?

The woman who signs my checks, Denise Rainer, everyone. Is this on? Thank you, DJ Snowbiz, and I just have one thing to say. And that is, thank you and thank you. No, no, no, no, no. Santa Charles, you have made this one Christmas season to remember. Hmm, your final season. And on behalf of myself, your fans, and all of Santa's helpers, we wanted to do something a little different, something meaningful. You're gonna make me slave cry. Cookies! They're vegan. I am so proud of how you structured the rules of this competition and how you did so without bias or prejudice or flatulence and how you took the time for each competitor to dig in and help them find their full Santa potential. Mm, with that level of grit and determination, I think we can be confident that your family's legacy is in good hands. Thank you, Denise. Thank you, but no need to put Santa Charles on the spot. Let's let him enjoy his cookies in peace. He earned them after all. Now are we ready for the final challenge? I can't hear you. It's time for an obstacle course unlike any other. A game that's gonna make you feel real sentimental. Please, please, a round of Santa applause for a game we're calling Santa's extra special delivery. Yes, yes, yes!

Your decisions mean something. Why would you say something silly like that? You'll do all this. Oh, hold up, I'm just playing, man. I'll do it. But under one condition. What are your conditions, man? If my crew can be Santa too. You're a dance group? Wait, so you're thinking all five of you? Yes, ma'am. That might work. Financially, that could be good. Let me ask you this. Why? 'Cause that, that's real. That's the gift of giving you're doing. That's the gift I was talking about. You got a new life and you're giving them a chance from it. I know. You think I can get a better hat? Yeah, this is Poon Daddy's. That's a legacy. Wear that with pride. Ho-ho-ho! Now, I get to go to Edinburgh! Yes! Not Alabama? - Santa Stephanie! - Hey, how are you? How old are you? Oh baby, I forgot. Are you a fairy? I'm more like an angel. Where are you from? Ohio. How do you do it? Do what, Kitty? Deliver all the presents in one night. Mommy said that you don't like milk. Oh, that's right. You know me lactose intolerant. It's not good for me stomach, you know. Hey, Santa Nick. Huh, yeah? Where's your belly? Oh, it kept getting stuck in the chimney. So I got rid of it. Give it up for Santa Clarence. Ho-ho-ho! All right, who's first? What do you guys want for Christmas? A unicorn. A unicorn? Makeup and puzzle. A puzzle? What about you? I want a Christmas present. A Christmas present, what kind? A dress? The little red one. A red one? Santa! Ho-ho-ho! Uh, heh. Ah. Well, we had a good run. Ah. Leave my mark. Ah. Huh. Well. Finally, Mr and Mrs Claus get what they want. A vacation! Mm, thank you, big Santa. - Brown sugar. - Woo!

No, I'm actually still in the hotel waiting for all of the team to finish up and good stuff, you know. I didn't want to go quite home yet 'cause I think I'm gonna surprise the mates. You know, head out there, you know, sit on their lap. Oh, I actually got a present for Clarence. Yeah, he's gonna love these. It's a flower. He doesn't actually like flowers and he specifically told me that, but I think it'll warm his heart a little bit. Give him a little Christmas cheer. So, mm, smells like Christmas. So I bought this for him. And yeah, I'm gonna go hang out with the mates. Yeah, maybe have some eggnog, something, you know. Have a little time before I get back to London town.
