She was sad when we left the refugee camp. I remember her coming when we were about to leave. She was so sad, she didn't even say anything, and I know she was so sad because she knew we couldn't make it in the United States. Now she's living in Anchorage with us. We enjoy having conversation with her. She's telling us what happened before, a hundred years ago. I'm from Congo. When I was three years old, we moved to Rwanda, and I lived in a refugee camp before I came here. We didn't have electricity. We were treated as people from other country. I used to miss my country, like, a lot, a lot, that I can think about it every night, but right now I feel like the U.S. is my home. [phone rings] - The client is here. - Okay. Is it Achmed that's there with you? - He is, yep. - Okay, and it's his mom that's there? - That's correct, yes, uh-huh. - And refresh me. What country is she in? - She is right now in Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa. - Okay. - Hi-ho. How are you? Oh, look at Rosie walking. I have not seen Rosie walking. Usually she's in your arms. Look at her. - Okay, you're gonna work on when and where today. - Okay, we'll try to find someone, Hope, that can maybe help you with driving, like, 'cause you live far away, so it's hard, like, to get from a place to the other. - Yeah, yeah. - Your job is to just graduate from high school. - So the bank will lend you money. Lend--lend means you can have it, but I get it back. - We have the Welcome Fund, which is, like, unrestricted money that donors from, like, around Anchorage donate to to help us fill in all the voids that don't exist through all the grants. If the client doesn't have the means and he comes back in, talk to him because if this $55 is a big difference between his ability to, like, get the housing that he needs, then tell him not to worry about it. Tell him the Welcome Fund covered it. - Yeah, okay. - So... Horrific things happen to refugees. You have met the qualifications of a refugee 'cause you have experienced extreme trauma. - Hello? - Hi, is this Ramiz? Most of our clients and the people that we are resettling have fled violent outbursts of civil war or ongoing conflict, militias coming through towns, burning villages, attacking women at very high rates, some of the highest rates of sexual violence against women. - When people flee from those places and they go to neighboring countries or they leave those countries and come here, some of those people are traumatized, like, and how do you help such people? - Every time I think, "How is it gonna be for them?" Clients from, let's say, a refugee camp from Somalia, they never saw a shower, so we're teaching them, and then they learn very quickly. My job is absolutely special. I see them at the airport, and a year later, they are different people. - When I first came to United States, it was completely a new country. I didn't even know how to get on the bus. Solange, she's my auntie, and we lived together when we were in a refugee camp. - Once you dip it the first time, you can swipe it there. - She doesn't speak or hear, and we enjoy seeing her in Anchorage. Maombi, she's my cousin. She lives in Anchorage, and she came one day before my grandma came. - Hey. How are you? You look very pretty today. - Out of the atrocities of World War II and out of the Holocaust, the globe said, "We need to ensure the safety of every human being." [indistinct speech] - And then we see that reflected all the way down to small-town America, who is stepping up to do their part to ensure that when that person gets here, they're welcomed to a place, and they have all the resources that they need. - All right, we will put food in the refrigerator. - And that's the heart of the Resettlement Program. That's the heart of why someone who's 102 years old has the right to come to this country and join her family, and as a globe, we have decided that that is a fact. If we were having this conversation a few years ago, I would tell you the likelihood that you would end up in the United States was very high. We used to welcome over half of the world's refugees. That's not the case today. The value of a human life is the value of a human life regardless of who you are. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] - How did this all come to happen? How did the universe start?

No, no, no. Be nice. I know. [indistinct chatter] - When you were writing, you were like... - All right, folks. Religion, what the heck is it? One of the elements of religion that is the most common is a belief in an absolute power. Now, some religions call this idea "God." Some religions call this idea "Allah." Some call it the "Tao." Some call it "Brahman." There are different ways of seeing these ideas, different relationships that people have with this idea. Not everybody has chosen a religion for themselves. Some people believe there is no spiritual world to connect with. That is called atheist. Agnostic is different. Agnostic is the idea that you're just not sure. Religion is like--it's like a vehicle that gets you from this human experience that we all have, and it connects you with a spiritual one. The First Amendment to the Constitution says, "Congress shall make no law "respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." What is the topic of the first right? - Religion. - Religion. That's how important it is in this country, this idea of freedom of religion. - Well, if that came up, then the best thing for that person to do is come and talk to me about it, and we will figure out if we can't pursue an--you know, a compromise. But in all of my years, doesn't happen. Mm-hmm. Most people are like, "Okay, teach me. Tell me what you got." So. Imagine if we were sitting in here and someone official walked into our classroom and said, "You know, we're having trouble with some kids, "and we need to remove some people. "We are going to remove all of the people who have on yellow striped shirts." - Poor Tawny. - Bye, Tawny. And we all look around, and we're like, "Oh, thank God it wasn't me," right? A few minutes pass, and they come back, and they look around, and they go, "Yup, you know what? I think everyone wearing black needs to come with us too." - I'm running. - Seriously. Should I have spoken up before, when they take poor little Tawny away because she has on yellow stripes? Maybe I made a mistake keeping my mouth shut, thinking I was comfortable sitting here in my black, because now it's my turn. We need to protect the rights of the smallest minority because in doing that, we're protecting our own rights. We can't get too comfortable. We have to stand up for each other.

How are you? - Come on in. How can I help you today? - You can either get assistance with tuition, with textbooks, with transportation, or with childcare. What questions do you have? - I just wanted to know about the food pantry and-- - The food pantry? Yeah. - 54% of our students are food insecure, and 59% of our students are housing insecure. - They're gonna repossess my car, and I'm not gonna be able to get to school. I'm gonna mess everything all up again. - And then here's the number. - For the utility bill? - Transportation, childcare, healthcare, utility payments, legal services, housing, things that I'd always assumed were someone else's responsibility, I understood had to be Amarillo College's responsibility. - I'm working really hard, and I really want to stay in school, and it's only--I just wanna be able to pay--pay my car.

That's where the magic is for our community because that's how we're gonna break the cycle of poverty that is not just crippling the Amarillo or panhandle region. It's gonna cripple our entire country.

That's why they're here. They exist to help students like you. You can provide a service all day, every day. You can hand out whatever you think people need, but until you can make somebody feel like a human being and that they're worthy of your time, it's not gonna matter. - Ultimately, what we all want is to be loved, to have a family, to have a job that pays us a living wage so that we can walk in hope and provide for those that we love and share a life with. The undercurrent of fear, I think, is an undercurrent of economic injustice. Opportunity for everyone rather than just the few. - The globe is most unkind when we determine that someone's life holds more value than another person's life. That's the start of unkindness. - With a society that has so much available to it in physical material, things, our country is at risk because we've just forgotten how to care for each other. - Hi, how are you? - Somewhere along the way it became okay to just kinda walk over bodies to get to where you're going. How disastrous does it have to become before we bring out the better angels of our inner souls? - Does that sound right? - Yes. - But as a society, where did we lose our way and say that this is okay that a whole bunch of people who live in abject poverty end up, years later, with somebody living on the streets 'cause they don't have the skills to survive in our world? - Should we see who's in the park first?

They've done for me from--than I could do for myself. - You look like you're stiff. When you go out to take care of a group of homeless people, and I would say in particular the street folks, they will show you the weaknesses in the mainstream health care system in a second... So it's coming in both hands? All right. - Things that we didn't even realize. There is no doubt that homelessness is a public health emergency and tragedy, and it's deadly. My name is O'Connell. I'm Dr. O'Connell. What do you need, anything? - I need mental health, and I want-- - Let me introduce... Street medicine can actually be just an extension of regular primary care, just--just trying to address the particular obstacles that group of people have to coming into care. Oh, okay. - I need your help. - In private? - Yeah. - Okay. We can do it in private. We learned that you can manage heart failure. You can manage hypertension. You can manage a lot of chronic diseases by bringing, you know, your blood pressure cuffs and your things outside. - Do they still use those? - I still think you had a little bit of a concussion when you fell down, and I'd rather have you in, Bobby, okay? - If you're trained in medicine, there is no career path to take care of homeless people. And you don't need detox, right? - No, no. - It was a nurse who said, "You've been trained all wrong," and she took away all the tools of my trade, and she said, "What we do is we tend to invite people in to soak their feet," and she said, "So I'm gonna have you soak feet." - Remember, foot care clinic is a gateway into primary care, not because we will just want to disturb people and just bother with vital signs, but it gives us an indication as to somebody's health condition. Does it make sense? - Yeah. - All right. - What's your name? - Walter Bogar. - Any allergies? What happened to this foot? - It's a long story. It's a gangrene toe. It's a dry gangrene. It'll fall off eventually. - My feet are soaking wet. Oh, walking in the rain. - How are you today? Do you have any allergies? Have you had any vaccine this year? - [speaks indistinctly] - Let's see what's going on here. Ooh. Did you see that this is really rough, Eric? You feel my thumb there? - Yeah. - How about here? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's take a look at the rest. - Oh, I can do this. - Any pain down here? - No. [indistinct chatter] - Yeah. - Yeah, let me see. Okay. - Oh, this? - I don't know why it's green. - My feet were wet all week. I walked around in wet sneakers for a week. - Oh, no. - Yeah. - That's bad news. - Oh, thank you. - So tell me, how's that? That help you? - Yeah. - Okay, okay. - The hotter the better. - Okay. - The hotter the better. - I was given this opportunity in America to go to school and then get my education in line, so I knew deep inside me that I need to give back to this community that have supported me. Where is my friend? - How are you, darling? - Okay, let's do it. - Okay. - There. - You do such a good job. You take good care of me. You really do. - Thank you. The mayor is here. The mayor is here. Good morning, Mayor. - Most homeless people don't hear somebody mention their name with dignity for weeks, sometimes, if not months. - Thanks. - Yeah. - The nurses are brilliant with this because it flips the power structure, so you're at the feet of the person you're trying to serve. - These people are human beings like you and me, and they also have fallen into bad times and ended up being homeless. What can we do to help them? Can you please allow me to get the blood pressure on your arm? - You can try. - Oh, thank you so much. - Didn't work last time. - Thank you. - It's gonna be through the roof 'cause I don't have my medication. - Oh. - Yeah, yeah. I'm done with this. My blood pressure's high. You can just tell every time. It's always high. I haven't had my meds in a week. - All right. Okay. This is--this is really high. - Yeah, it's nothing to worry about. It's been like that forever. - What can I do? Just-- - Nothing. You--there's nothing you can do. What are you gonna do? - I can call that doctor up and-- - Yeah, what's that gonna do? - Make you an appointment to see him ASAP, as soon as possible. - Who, Rothford? - Yes. - And what is that gonna do? - He's gonna at least increase your blood pressure medication. - Yeah, if you wanna try, you can try calling him. - No, I will do it now. - God bless you guys. Awesome. - Can you get him a appointment with Dr. Rothford at Pine? - You--did you... [indistinct] - Why? Why, in America-- why would people be still sleeping on the street? What can we do to bring all those people every night on the street into a house so they wouldn't experience snow on them, rain, even heat of the sun? Some will come in, and they look exhausted, so I give them a glass of water, check their vital signs. Some, I will see medical issues. I have to send them out to the hospital, so you treat people with kindness. We make them to open up, and you will see more. - Do you have gloves? - No. - You can earn people's trust but be present. Sometimes it happens on the first day. Sometimes it happens after six months, but the persistence and the continuity is what really works, and when you can do that, then you can start to deliver health care. If you don't take the time to do that, you can't. - Skin looks good. This hurt? There's an aspect of my comfort zone that I've completely demolished and expanded just coming here, working with feet. At first, it was hard to get used to, and--and now, you know, it's--it's just an aspect of humans. - Do you mind if I take your vitals? - Everyone in here who's walking behind me, they--this is their job, and they're everywhere. They are all over the country, all over the world, you know, helping people, taking some small effort to--to provide and try to, you know, equal the playing field in a unfair world. - In one year, I've come from absolutely nothing, a stuttering mess downstairs-- with the help of the staff and everybody else, I've come out one complete year to having my feet fixed, my hip reta--replaced. I got a smile, you know? I got my headlights on now, you know what I mean? So I'm a complete new vehicle thanks to this place, and that's the reason why I am where I am today. - And thanks to yourself. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - When I look at the long vision, my guess is those two months invested in soaking this man's feet, which--for which we could get no income, probably saved the system a few million dollars down the line. I have come to think of homelessness--this is my own little version of it, is like if you held a prism up to society, right, what gets refracted are the weaknesses in every sector, in the education sector, in the housing sector, the health sector, corrections, and justice. We have to figure out how to address the weaknesses in all of those societal sectors if we're really gonna address the problem. - Go. - Guys! - Whoo-hoo! - You don't have any air in the tire. - Yeah, it's been hard to ride lately. - Oh, my goodness. It's flat. Look at that. When you get a flat tire, you need to stop by, and--and I'll pump it up for you. - Okay. - Okay? - Thank you. - Oh, of course. This is something that I love to do. You wanna go--pump it up? It's a little hard, isn't it? - Mm-hmm, it's really hard. [grunts] - It feels different. - Doesn't it, different? Give it a shot. I'll bet you're really gonna like it. - Oh, ahh! - How's that? - Oh, my gosh, look how easy it is!

Okay, have fun. - Kay, who's gonna figure out who sits in the front seat? - I will! - I will! - I saw--I do that, Estelle. - Okay. - Children need to know that they are beloved, and elders need to know that their lives still have meaning and purpose. - How about some water, guys? - It's a place for fostered and adopted people, not just, like, regular people that would live in a regular house. - We believe generations coming together makes a powerful safety net. - As long as I feel like I can help any of these children in any way, I really feel privileged, and that's the main reason I moved here. - It means so much to me to have a child in my life who trusts me, and when you see the love for some of the elders, it's very evident. There we go. - The children have always been at ease here. They've come from abuse, and yet they came here with open arms. - You ended here, or did you end here? - Right here. Every kid here has an elder that they hang out with. "Probably just a temper tantrum," George says.

We all have places that we wanna end up. Working and going to school all the time, I was mentally and physically exhausted. I'm a hard worker. I love my son. I want to be a good mom. It was Christmastime. I couldn't buy my son Christmas gifts. I was working like crazy. I go in to take my biology final. Every question, I'm like, "I don't know. I don't know. I don't know." You know, all these thoughts are running through my head that, "Oh, you're a failure," you know? "Everything that you've done, you've failed, "and you failed with your--you failed with your son. "You failed with hairdressing. You failed with waiting tables. You failed at being a provider for your son," but I was giving my all. And so I really just wanted to get in my car and drive it off a cliff, and that's exactly what I wanted to do because in my head I'm sitting there thinking, "You're--if this didn't work, none of it's ever gonna work, "and Kingston's gonna be happier with my parents, and he'll be taken care of," and--and I left that place holding in as much as I could. I knew I needed to reach out for help. I knew I needed to talk to somebody because I was afraid of what I was gonna do to myself. I had heard about the ARC through a fellow student, and she was a single mother as well. - Figure out a plan, kinda talk about, like, where you're at, where you wanna be. She came in, and she said, "I need to talk to someone. I don't know what to do." - I poured my heart and soul out in that--in that office. - And I just got to know her for who she is, and she's amazing. - Now we help... - At the most vulnerable time in my life, when somebody could have turned me away, somebody could have judged me, they encouraged me. They hugged on me. They loved on me. They listened to everything I had to say. - I just explained to her what we could provide in here. - I had no idea that they would help me with my bills. - The services that we had, the resources that we had... - They cared about me enough to invest in me. And that's... [sniffles] - The number of students that utilize that service is overwhelming to me. We have all of these services, but none of those services individually are designed to eradicate poverty, but if we as a college can glue them together in a way that allows Alicia to stay in school and graduate with a degree and matriculate into a living-wage job, then she doesn't need those services anymore. We solved her problem long-term by fixing the barriers that she faces short-term, and it's taken every part of the community to make that happen. - What we really need is community, and that's wellbeing. That's resilience. That's--that's the joy of it all 'cause if I can dance with you, if I can laugh with you, you trust me, and if you trust me, you're gonna come see me when things are hard. - Community is where hope is going to be found. - The biggest need for us is we need each other, and when we say that, we're not just talking about people within 3 feet around us, but we start there. We have to take time to have each other experience what it means to be a neighbor to each other. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ I'll see you later, babe. Yep.

I'm trying to make this as less hoops as possible. What I'm committing is trying to get 60 people they driver's license back from and around this neighborhood or at large that are people of color. Let us not forget that being African American in this country meant you were treated cruel at some point, and a couple of things. We can live in sorrow of that because those scars of my grandparents have affected me, and they affect people in my neighborhood. But for me, what I'm looking for is healing. And how to utilize his gifts and his power. - [indistinct] says it best. There are assets. We just gotta tap into the assets and understand that they don't look like me. They don't look like you, and we just need to be able to embrace them because once you do that, there's hope and healing within the body of the community. - What listening does, it builds the first piece of capital that we all need as humans. It's trust. But to have they power shined on, right? In honor, right? These people have power. These are my neighbors. [applause] And I learned a couple of lessons, the power of being a neighbor and the power of shutting up and listening. [laughter] On these little journeys, the young people learn also the practice of stopping and treating your neighbors with dignity. They know what it means to be treated in a way that is not dignified, but they also understand how to treat people with dignity. - Welcome to McDonald's. How can I take your order? - We don't sell hot sauce here, ma'am. - I want to continue discovering the gifts and talents of everybody in the life of our community, find a place for they gift, and celebrate their gifts in ways that build community, economy, and mutual delight. Five and five. We just want you to pay attention. You keep this in your pocket. You understand?

I want to be a witness, not just in my zip code, but I want me and my neighbors all over the world to be a witness to the power of love. Y'all wanna make the bike shop here? - I don't know about that. - I've been thinking about buying this for the bike shop and fixing it up. - I don't even know her name. - Do you know her name?

And they were pretty rough places. Oh, my God, look at that tree, John. - It is magical, yes.

There are different ways to adapt the environment, adapt lessons, adapt everything, really, to help somebody be more successful. - Gotta get samples. - You have to remember that these folks were placed in the '40s, '50s, and '60s and functionally abandoned. They still hold on to decades and centuries of judgment, Older gents and women who lived there for 55 years and who were probably typically normal intelligence but had a physical disability, They were in a terribly ugly environment for the most part. - We're evolving as a community, as a country. The inclusiveness of this population, years ago, you didn't know that they existed. - Hi. - Good morning. The residents are essential in helping us pack out for things like that, and it's really like a team effort. - We're outside of a clinic. We're outside of a four-wall normal situation. - So what are we doing today? - Washing lettuce. - You got it. You got it. Okay. - The perfect day on the farm is all of the staff standing back and watching while the residents do the job.

I love seeing them going to the barbershop. If everywhere were to feel how we feel in this little town that we're in, it'd be great. - Ah, ah. Ah. - Ah. - It's only been 40 years that they've come from the dark ages, and I fear they could go back if we don't get a handle on some of this stuff. The single most important thing to do for us all living on this planet, it's being empathetic, caring for your fellow man. If you have that in your arsenal, you can do just about everything. - Come on in, boys. Good morning, ladies. Come on. Come on. - Sorry. - Okay. It's okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, this first quote comes from the religion Judaism, the Talmud, Shabbat 31a, and the quote says, "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow men." If you find it hateful, whether it's the way someone talks to you, looks at you, treats you differently, whatever it is, if you find it hateful--so you can make, in your own head silently, a list of all the hateful things that people could--the way they could treat you. Now take that list, and don't treat other people that way. It's pretty simple. Most world religions have some version of the Golden Rule, and they all basically are saying the same thing. It's all about how we treat each other. All right, so underneath the quote, what you're going to do--and this is part of the warm-up. I want you to tell me about a time where somebody treated you in a hateful way or--you treated them or they treated you, so you can be on either side of this hateful treatment. After that, how did that make you feel? - There had been an incident at Downey High School where a student had been bullied, and we really felt that if all students had this information, that it just might influence their attitudes about someone who was different from them within our community. - Having the world religions class is a natural extension of talking about the diversity of our nation. In the United States, our differences are not a weakness. They're a strength, but how can we teach about religion in a public school setting? We brought in the First Amendment Center to do a lot of training with our teachers. We had representatives from all of our different religious traditions in the community to come in and take a look at the course outline and then come back to us to give us feedback. - Every day, we treat people in a way that we would not ourselves wanna be treated. - One of our major concerns when we developed the world religions course was the controversy that--making a graduation requirement that all students would be required to take the class. - That we felt that it was important enough that every student in Modesto have an understanding of the different traditions that make up our community. - We hope to reach enough students that they're going to have a second thought about saying something that's inappropriate about someone else based on their faith, based on their race, based on their gender. - Today, in their lives right now, they will come across people of other faiths, at the mall, in their classroom, or the parents of fellow students who practice all of these different faiths, and the more they know about each other, the easier it's gonna be to get along and be compassionate with each other. Underneath the word "respect," you're going to copy the definition, "honoring the worth and value of individuals and institutions and treating them accordingly." Does it say you have to agree with them? - No. - Does it say you have to like them? Nope. Treat other people with respect regardless of how they treat you. Maybe they will pull themselves up to your level rather than you going down to theirs. - Treat people with dignity. Believe what they say. Every single person deserves to be celebrated, every single person. - We all have fear of things we do not understand, and I think sometimes what we perceive in a community to be unwelcoming is really fear, fear of "Is this gonna change who we are? Is this gonna change our values?" That's where that comes from. - The hate that exists in this country could be our destruction, or it could be our clarion call. - But I think it does take someone in leadership to say, "We are going to build bridges." - I wanna live in a country that is a genuinely egalitarian democracy. Who is it who is willing to risk something on behalf of people who others hate? How do you develop more solidarity with the oppressed? - Galatians 1, starting with verse 15, "He is the image of the invisible God, "the firstborn of all creation, "for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created." This is the word of the Lord. all: Thanks be to God. [birds chirping] - I remember some of my critics said, "Wow, who are you to set aside 2,000 years of tradition?" The only possible answer I could give was, "I am attempting to exercise my vocation as a Christian ethicist." What happened was vicious attacks on social media and in reviews, lost friendships. "You're no longer a good Christian. I can't be your friend anymore." It helps to remember that by 2014 when I wrote "Changing Our Mind," I was the coauthor of the leading textbook in Christian ethics in the evangelical world. I had taught thousands of students, but I had been blinded to the harm that traditional teaching does. I had repeated the Christian party line that God made human beings, male and female, for heterosexual relationships only, and everything else is sin. My mother-in-law, Lynnie, is a Baptist of long standing, and so I--I get her to church on Sunday morning, and she's in the class. She's the oldest in the class, but she's not the only 80-something person in the class. - Morning. - Morning. Have you ever been in a Sunday school class that has this kind of diversity in it, Mom? - No. [laughs] The class that I belong to, we're all elderly white women. - Mm-hmm. - So a breath of fresh air. A new day has dawned in the world if this class can exist and do what it's doing. - I have an incredible amount of respect for David Gushee. He was the champion of the Southern Baptist evangelicals. - How are you? - I'm good. I'm good. - If you've been to a Baptist seminary in the last 25, 30 years, you've read his books. This world-renowned theologian and ethicist, he's now an outcast. - We're in Job 9 today. Job, at this point, by chapter nine, feels like God has put him on trial, you might say, but God is both the adversary, and God is also the judge, and so Job feels overwhelmed by the unfairness of the situation. - And powerless. - He's totally powerless. Verse four through ten. - "He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who alone stretched out the heavens and..." - The question of which Bible passages are most relevant to whatever it is you're thinking about is itself a matter of interpretation. - "Who will say to him..." - I have met people whose children are dead because they committed suicide because somebody told them that they were wretched sinners going to hell, and they got that from bible passages. And this line, where it ends, "I know that I am not what I am thought to be." There are people who have been told that God condemns you, that you are not okay, that you are guilty before God. - Well, I resonate with the story, but I was thinking about my own personal journey. Job did this all by himself, I feel like, and once I, like, came out, that kinda changed everything for me, and it gave me a support system and more people to walk with me on the journey. And I feel like he was very isolated still, and so for him to be that brave is real inspiring. - So I think of suicidality of LGBTQ young people, right? There's nowhere to go. "I'm boxed in, condemned for being who I am, "no escape from who I am, but you made me how I am, and now you judge me for how you made me." How is that fair? Can we stand up and hold hands and have a prayer? There are maybe six to eight passages in the Bible that appear to address same-sex sex, and they're all negative. Dear Lord... you are healing us through this direct and honest encounter with scripture, with church at its best but also church at its worst. I realized that the traditional rendering of the traditional verses that were cited was actually like a weapon of spiritual destruction. - There have been times in our lives when we didn't feel safe, rejected by family, being dis--literally disowned by family. When I came out, my father, Baptist minister, on his deathbed, his words were, "I have no son named Theron." - Which commandment says to hate people, you know? Which one says to shut them out for being themselves and not hurting anyone? - Oh, yeah. - Here it is. - That was--okay, for context-- "So I am a boy." - "A super-duper-duper--" - A super-duper. "For sure cool." - My handwriting's never been good. I was hospitalized in September of 2016 over my gap year for a suicide attempt, and I was in the hospital for a while, and my church was so good to me. - To go into to Sunday school and go, "Oh, gosh, you know, Jamie's a guy, and what do we do with that, and how do we support that?" - For us to have a safe place as parents to say, "Of course we wanna be supportive. "Of course we believe in our kid, but holy cow, this is hard stuff." - I was raised in the mountains of North Georgia, and I had never heard the word gay or lesbian. The people that are in this church have helped me to be a better person. - I grew up in South Georgia, a small town. I had never seen a gay in my life. - Mm-hmm. - There's been a lot of change, and I've had to wrestle with that. - Mm-hmm. - When I was a little girl, there were no women ministers, no women deacons, nobody of a different race or a different cultural background in this church. - Moving through the Old Testament, there is this ongoing, resonating sense that there's something hopeful about what lies ahead. We are learners on this journey together. - If the way you're reading the Bible brings hate of neighbor, it negates the central command of Jesus. The role of the Christian community and its leaders especially is to help the people interpret the Bible in a way that gives life rather than takes it. - People are now feeling what they felt as a child and that they do have a place of belonging. When I walked through the doors of this church the first time, and we were holding hands, the minister said, "Welcome, friends." It had been a long time since church felt like home. - If you would all stand. If you agree to support this couple, say "we do" when I tell you it's time to say "we do." Do you promise not to leave them alone to struggle on their own but instead to undertake life's journey alongside them? all: We do. [cheers and applause] - In practice, this church has become fully inclusive in every way that mattered. Openness in Baptist churches is often measured by when those barriers begin to drop. - He didn't even know about Thursday night. - My kids saw people who loved each other, and I think because of that love and support, Jamie was able to find his voice. - God love you. - If you think about it from, "I have no son named Theron," symbolizing the most hateful of rejections and the most--the most vicious because it's parent-child to "I have a son named Jamie," that's quite a journey. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

You need to respect everyone even if you don't understand what they--what their religion is. You still have to respect them because they are human. - Despite our races, our religions, we are all human beings, aren't we? - And all the religions really lead up to, like, the main point is kindness. - It doesn't matter who the person is. It's to treat them with kindness. - I want people to look past their religions. I want people to look past their differences. I wanna make a change, and I want our generation of teenagers to be at least a good aspect of that change. - I know that other people don't believe what I believe in, and there's other beliefs. I have no right to judge or shame others for their beliefs. - This was some interesting stuff. Like, I never knew what Buddhists and Hindus had in common. - The more I learned about different religions, the more I realized, like, how they're just--they're all connected. - The values that the different people in the religions have, they all--they teach really, like--like, it increases integrity within a person as an individual. - This type of class required would probably be an amazing thing when you think about it. Like, it might not even just stop in America. It might even go all around, and that could really help some really bad situations in a lot of places, when you really think about it. - Yeah. - I grew up being a Christian, and when I seen, like, Muslims or Jews, like, walking around, I would just--they dress different. Sometimes you look at them, and you think, like, "They're so weird," and I would kinda just make fun of them with my friends, and now I--I can't imagine myself doing that because, like, that is their religion, and that's just horrible.

We are going to sing a song. [soft guitar music plays] ♪ ♪ [all singing in native language] [warm music] ♪ ♪ - Oh! - Oh. [all speaking native language] - Nobody made it here alone. We have all extended that helping hand because we knew exactly how hard it was. Stand if you have ever gone to a study session and you or someone brought food. Stand if you have ever lent or borrowed a textbook. Stand if you have ever helped tutor a student that needed help with a class, and lastly, stand if you helped a fellow student out with encouragement, direction, accountability, or even love. You see? I'm standing up here today because of you. We all are here today because we all helped each other. - I'm convinced it's that kindness that we all share that brings out the best in all of us, and that's when we feel best about who we are. - We are all humans kind of stumbling through life, trying to figure out our place, so I think treating people with kindness means understanding that, expressed through patience and caring. - If every one of us chip in in our own different ways to do something, no matter how small, I think we will have a better community and a better country. - What can you share with the rest of the world? We need to value what's present and what's good in people. - We must agree there are certain basic human rights that we must all protect no matter what. - We need to be kind, respectful, and responsible within society to live in a civil democracy. - We all are immigrants and refugees from other places creating a country that has a vision. - There is love across this country that happens every day. It's not about ignoring those destructive elements of our society. It's deciding that my attention is gonna go to the good. - I think it's the glue that holds us together, I guess you could say, and I think it's just really important because without kindness, we'd all be maniacs.
