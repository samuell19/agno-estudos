Beware! My brethren. The fruitful place was a wilderness. And all the cities thereof were broken. For thus hath the Lord said: 'The whole land shall be desolate'. Yet will I not make a full end. Brethren...think on those words. Ready yourselves...as this dear child, this night... - makes ready. Gathered here on this best night of baptism with holy and merciful Christ, - whose precious blood shed at Calvary, we are orphans. Let this child - enter your wondrous kingdom. - Jesus saves. - Halleluiah! Halleluiah! Thou art to be born again. Save us, Jesus! Save us! Halleluiah! Halleluiah! - On you the agony. The humiliation! The degradation - of a life without Christ! Love me! Brethren, I came to Christ! - I bathed in his blood. - Adore his blood! Adore his blood! - And now I am cleansed of all sin! - Halleluiah! - I am saved. - Save us, Jesus! Save us! Halleluiah! - I was damned. - I was a sinner, Lord! - I prayed- - Jesus, help me! I'm punished, yes, but I am born again! Halleluiah! I sit at Christ's right hand. Halleluiah! Tell one of them you'll bear the anguish of eternal damnation! Please Jesus help me, for I am a sinner. For without Christ you are destroyed! - You are as dead. Repent! - Please help me! The choice is yours... Love Christ or be devoured by hellfire. - Brethren... Love your Christ... - Or die! - Halleluiah! - Now let us sing to Christ Jesus. For you are all of you his children. - And you are all of you to be obedient to him. Sing my brethren. - For he is with you now on this glorious night of baptism. Sing! ♪ He was nailed to the cross, to the cross. ♪ And the wounds he suffered were for me. ♪ He was nailed to the cross and I tremble at the loss ♪ Let his love follow me, follow me ♪ Let his love follow me, follow me ♪ Wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ Let his blood flow all over me (Over me) ♪ Oh wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ Wash me in his blood till I am free ♪ (Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty) ♪ Let his love follow me, follow me ♪ There is no place I can hide that he can't see ♪ Let his love set me down for I know where I am bound ♪ Let his love follow me, follow me ♪ Let his love follow me, follow me ♪ Oh wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ (Let his blood) Flow all over me (Over me) ♪ Oh wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ Wash me in his blood till I am free ♪ I have sinned, Oh my lord I have sinned ♪ And I know what my punishment must be ♪ I have sinned without regret and my punishment is death ♪ But I know with my death that I'll be free ♪ But I know with my death that I'll be free ♪ So wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ Let his blood flow all over me (Over me) ♪ Oh wash me in his blood Wash me in his blood ♪ Wash me in his blood till I am free ♪ Wash me in his blood till I am free Bastard! Come on, fucker! Come on! Get him. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. They were trying to break in. I didn't realise there was two of them at first. One of them had a go at me with a screwdriver. Think yourself lucky it was only a screwdriver. Yeah? What is that supposed to mean? It could have been murder like the one up river. Third woman in three months. - Strangled by the looks of her. - Another one? Yeas. Stripped and dumped by some barges. Barges? Where? By Hammersmith bridge. Doctor reckons she was killed just after midnight. Midnight? Had a patrol out there just after then. Yeah, see anything? Well of course not. I'd have reported it otherwise. Wouldn't I? Yes. He's a sly bastard whoever he is. And sick! Who's there? Who is it? You startled me. Did you sleep well mother? Thank you. Yes. - Mother...I want... - Kenneth. A little prayer. A little prayer. I'm tired, mother. You must never talk like that. That's the way your father talked. You must never talk like that. God...thank you for today. We have sinned. Please forgive us, God. We have sinned. Please hear our prayers. You're a fine sight first thing in the morning. God help the man who's daft enough to marry you! - You smoke too much. - And drink. Will the smoking and drinking Lady Jervis be home for a meal tonight? - Because if so...it's her turn to cook. - It's my turn to cook. No. Won't be home tonight. You're not going to skive another meal off mother, are you? Well, if you're really that interested in what I'm doing tonight, I'm interviewing what the police call a 'false confessor'. What's he falsely confessing to? The murder of two women. But if he reads the papers this morning I should think he'll make it three, just to impress. With a bit of luck he might get to you before cancer does. There, darling. I don't think I can eat anything this morning, thank you mother. That's not like my Kenny. - Has anything upset you, darling? - No. I'm...I'm just not hungry. That's all. Oh, and I've just made you a fresh pot of tea. Hurry up. It'll get cold! Kenny, eat up your breakfast. That's a good boy. I think I'd rather get some sleep. All right. I'll pour out your tea and take it up to your room. You're with only doing things, mother. I can tell. That's the way you're carrying on. - Where is she anyway? - Your face! It's just a scratch, mother. I had a spot of bother last night with a couple of layabouts. You must be careful, Kenneth. Please. They came at me with a screwdriver, I think it was. - And the next person... - I taught them though. - Have you seen the link, Kenneth? - Mother...I... - Yes. I met someone last night. - I... - I can... - I met someone last night... - Kenneth don't speak. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Excuse me. - Yes? Does Mrs. Weyms live here? Yes, I'm Mrs. Weyms. Who are you? I'm the district nurse. Who? - Nurse Lynch. - Lynch? Lynch? Where's Nurse Prentice? - I want Nurse Prentice. - She's left. Been transferred to another district. Do you love your god, child? - Oh...what? - What religion are you? - Oh I... - You do believe, don't you? - Yes, of course. - I like Nurse Prentice. - Nurse Prentice was always punctual. - I'm not sure of the district yet. I'm just going downstairs for ten minutes, mother. That is my son. I look after him. When Ken was a child his father tried to take him away. But our Brethren stopped him. Our Brethren took the man to court. It was God's will that we got possession of him. God looks after the righteous. Have you got my insulin, nurse? - Yes, of course Mrs. Weyms. - Good. Hello dear. You here for the business? - Yes. - Well don't just sit there, dear. Do you want a short time or not? £5 for a complete strip. - Where can we go? - We can go back to my place. - How much did you say? - £5! Back at my place! Or £2 for a play about in the back of the truck. What are you doing? Get away from me you lunatic! No! Get away from me you lunatic! On the day of damnation all who are not of the faith will perish in hellfire. If you are the true believers, then you shall be saved. You have given yourselves and Christ will absolve you of all sin. For he knows all and he is with you. I won't tell anybody. Please don't! And as long as you are doing his work, let those demons with which you have to live, to which you fight against... This is the voice of the leader. Saying unto you, my brethren, all over the world... Look to Christ for forgiveness. Pray that you may see the light. You are able to carry on His work. You know you really should go out. - The doctor will tell you that... - I know what the doctor said. Why don't you get Kenny to take you to the park? Kenneth. His name is Kenneth. I never go out. I've dedicated my life to...my brethren and the crusade. The bandage nurse, you're tying it too tight! I'm sorry. Is that better? His father, you see...left him. I have the brethren to thank that Kenny's still with me instead of with his father. When my sister died she left me this house. And I...I changed it into a chapel. I gave it to the Crusaders. Do I have to tell you again nurse, you're tying it to tight! - And Kenneth? - What about him? - Does he belong to it too? - Of course. The minister and I have brought him up between us. We've protected him. Oh yes, Kenny too has dedicated his life to God. My Kenneth works hard. He's a security guard. Only part time. The rest of the time he's a swimming instructor. Nurse, you're hurting me. There you are Mrs. Weyms. Why are you looking at me like that? - I don't understand. - You're thinking... A mad woman. Who prays to God. I'll try to be on time tomorrow. God please forgive me. Oh, I've changed her bandages and given her an insulin injection. I'll see myself out. As a man you make certain sacrifices... The use of drugs is forbidden by the brethren. No medicine can replace the healing spirit of the Lord. No doctor...no blood transfusions can heal like Jesus of Nazareth. You will not visit places of entertainment to amuse yourselves when you should be carrying out his work. Yours is the work of the Lord. Seek out those who are not of our faith. Tell them of the error of their ways. And in doing so you will bring to the fold other converts, and sow strength from the numbers of the brethren. For one day the earthly world will belong to the brethren. And we will all sit at God's right hand in his world. Kenny, I don't like the new nurse. I'll phone doctor. Get him to send someone else. - Don't listen to anything she says. Yes, mother. The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous work. Your gold and silver is cankered. And the rust of them shall be a witness against you. And to eat your flesh as it was fire. Kenneth... Where were you last night? - Yes? - Dress yourself properly! I beg your pardon! Otherwise I shall have to ask you to leave. Ask me to leave? Who the hell do you think you are? I'm the attendant in charge here, so just do as I say. - Dress yourself properly. Decently! And be quick about it! Tell him I want to distribute some pamphlets. Yes. You know I will. Yes mum, you know I do. Goodbye mother. Oh, excuse me. Look, I'm sorry about just now. Well, let's forget it, shall we? - Well, can I give you a lift somewhere. - No, you don't have to do that. Oh look, I said I'm sorry. - Come on. - Oh, all right. Minister? You're early. - I trust you're well? - I am. - Is it all ready? - Not quite. - How many this evening? - Thirty to forty, minister. God willing. Is that all? God will not easily forgive the others for that. No, minister. - Kenneth. Where's he? - Oh, he had to go out. - Distributing the pamphlets. But he did up the tape ready for the meeting. To save the wretched from themselves we must take the world to them. If they are not prepared... They must be made to listen to the word of God. Of course. Don't stand there woman, get the chapel ready. - Thanks for the lift. Bye. - No, please don't go yet. - Pardon? - I just want to say sorry. Well you've said it. I must go now, really. Mercy be the Lord, brethren, mercy to the pious. A message to one he loves. From the shrine... Take heed for it is the Lord's word he speaks. Hear your leader in Arizona... The Lord has spoke to me and I command you to listen to his words. For the Lord said unto me I charge you to go forth and spread the word among the unbelievers and the heathens of the world. And to fight the good fight, and to fight this fight. So I say unto you, follow the word of the brethren. Disobey the word of the brethren and so shall you all perish. Praise be to our leaders. Praise be to our Lord. Do not fail him, my brethren. Do not fail yourselves. Remember it is Christ's fight we are fighting. Repent ye now for the end is nigh. - Prayers for forgiveness. - He died for us on the cross! Twelve hours of non-stop prayer. Ye shall serve Christ. What if you do suffer for him as he suffered for you? Why, when the dread day of damnation is on its own... and everything is obliterated from the face of the earth... you, and you alone...will be blessed by his divine grace. Blessed be the name of Jesus. No sacrifice is great enough - Blessed be the brethren. - You are chosen. - You and you alone suffer... for the sins of the world. Halleluiah! Down on your knees and pray. Pray brethren, pray... - Fear the Lord's wrath. - Christ Jesus save us. - For we are sinners. - Jesus save us! - Save our souls for we have sinned. Oh, Jesus, help us. Save us for we are sinners. Jesus. Sing sister, for the love of our brethren.

Listen...I'll run you back to the bus stop, and that's it. Here! What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't arrest me, governor. You and me, we could go somewhere, only don't hit me. Well, say something then. Look, here's a couple of quid. Please let me go. You won't be the first cop I've been with. Come on...a little more. Right, come on, that's it. A few words with you, Kenneth. I'm busy now mother, you can see. A friend. Have you found yourself a friend, Kenneth? You're my only friend mother. You know that. A girl friend, Kenneth? Of course not. Do these belong to her, Kenneth? No. I met her...you see...and... Yes, darling. We got talking. And when she said she wanted me to do things to her, I realised that she was a sinner. But she will be reborn, mother. Pure in souls and spirit. Won't she, mother? Kenny, you must never let them tempt you. They'll try and make you have sex! Like that woman...and your father. They're all the same, Kenny. They're all the same! Yes, but no-one loves them, mother. Not proper love. And it's like you say, mother, isn't it? There's only one kind of love. - I meant... - You mustn't upset yourself. You're doing God's work. Am I mother? Really? Really, god's work? Because I don't want to do anything to be ashamed of, mother. I don't want the minister to cast me out. - Don't let him send me away. - I'll never let him send you away, my darling. Never. You belong to me. I'll never let him send you away. I promise you! I'm sorry sir, but you can't park here. - Can you ask your driver to... - What's your name? - Jim Hutchin, sir. - Jim Hutchin. Do you own a Mini Minor, GCV 358D? - Yes. - I want to talk to you. - What about? - Do you know a girl called Joyce Jones? Joyce...? - Yes you do. - A known prostitute. - A known p... - Where did you pick her up? - Listen, I don't know what... - Where did you pick her up? Baywater Road. Where did you take her? A factory, sir, Western Avenue. - What time? - How do I know what time? Time! What time? - About eleven...half eleven. - Are you married? - Of course I'm married. - Then tell us all you know. I don't know anything, do I?! - A convicted prostitute.... - What do you mean a convicted... - Found murdered. - Found mur... Listen, I'm telling you you're not pinning anything on me! I don't know anything about murder. Found on a factory estate where you took her. I swear to you... I swear to you I don't know anything about it. It was on of your blokes. They're sick, mentally sick! The pair of them. They're being brainwashed by that church of their's. You should know, you're their doctor. She has the right to worship any way she pleases. I don't like Bible-banging anymore than you do, but you've got to get it into that stubborn, little head of yours, there's nothing you nor I can do about it. - She's terrified. - What? What would happen if they discovered she takes insulin? The brethren forbid it, you know. Yes, I do know. If she decided to stop there'd be nothing I could do about it. I see. What sort of life is that? No films, no television, no pets... Can't go out, no medicine. Don't you know they're killing her. Look, I've told the local health authority what the situation is. Now that's all I can do. Reasonably it's all anyone can do. - They're not breaking any law. - I don't know why I bother to go there. You go because Kenny's too squeamish to give her the injection. I couldn't get in through the front door. If I tried to force my way in I'd be breaking the law. Okay Paul, you've made your point. But there must be something that somebody can do. - I've already told you. - Oh wow, now for something completely different! It's Paul and Mrs. Weyms. - Oh, that's great. - I'd better go. - Hello Penny, and goodbye immediately. - Goodbye. - See you later. - Better see you out. Waste not want not. - Kenny, you're going out? - It's my night off, mother. But the minister's calling. I thought I'd do some door-to-door work. Some canvasing, I thought. But he'll be angry. It's the... It's the second time, Kenny. It's not just the minister you're letting down, it's the entire brethren. And after all they've done for us both. You wouldn't remember... You were only a child... But the brethren have fed you and clothed you, Kenny and taught you to think decently. And you've given them everything. Isn't that enough for them?! Kenny, how dare you speak like that. If the minister could hear you speak like that he's cast you out! In God's name I could do nothing to prevent it. Because God too would have cast you out. - I'm sorry mother. - You'd be no better than a leper. - Mother, I said I'm sorry. - That nurse woman, has she been talking to you? Has she been putting ideas into your head? Of course not. You're talking exactly like your father. The minister can keep you company. He was going to hear you admission, Kenny. You did promise. I've nothing to admit. Look at me Kenny. Then tell me... Tell me Kenny. I've nothing to admit. Then you won't mind staying. - All right, mother? - You look smart. Very smart. - What are they? - It's about the brethren. - Well, what do they do? - They can save you. What are you, some sort of bloody crank? I liked your interview where the fellow goes around confessing to the murder of women because he's obviously... Hey, come and listen to this. Dear Paddy, I liked your interview with the fellow who goes around confessing to the murder of women, because he's obviously as kinky as wait for it, a £3 note. But it's be more to the point if you found yourself a real murderer. Why don't you write about something that matters. Would you like one of these, sir? I think you'll find it very interesting. Fire and brimstone again! Do me a favour! Bloody awful what they're getting up to. You're the aspiring busybody, the so-called reporter. Why don't you get off that fat arse of yours and do something about it? Charming. And a little less of the fat arse. Excuse me madam, can I interest you in one of these? Thank you very much. What about you? Couldn't you do something about it? Couldn't you write an exposé or something? I don't know. Religion is a bit uncool these days. This is different. It's so sick. Something ought to be done about those crank religions. I don't know. I suppose it won't do any harm to take a look. - Is your mother in? - Why? - I'm from the brethren. I come here sometimes. - I'm sorry, she's out. Oh, well I wonder if I can interest you in our work? - Sorry, I'm in a hurry. - I've got several pamphlets here that I'm sure you'll find most interesting. - No, I'm sorry, I'm going... - It would only take just a - few minutes of your time. - Some other time. I'm sorry. I'll hear your admission now. Kenneth I will talk to later. I know you can't tell me there is nothing to which you can admit. I'm frightened, minister. You have reason to be. They are all miserable sinners who go in fear forever of the wrath of the Lord. You see I keep getting these thoughts. Minister, the sort of thoughts that I must admit I must ask you to help me. The nature of these thoughts? These thoughts... Come now. Dear Jesus on Calvary, hear my admission. I've sinned and I must be clean. - When I'm alone, you see... - At night? You see, when I try to sleep... I get foul thoughts and I'm ashamed and I... I turn to Christ to help me... Help me! Look at me. Christ will expunge them. I'm sometimes filled with doubt. That is the road to damnation. Dare you spit in Christ's face as the drunken soldier spat at Calvary? Think of his pain. They crucified him. Is that not enough for you? - They drove nails into his hands. - Oh! If you want to be saved from everlasting damnation, - you must beg him to heal you. Down on your knees. Beg. Beg. Beg. Beg, child, beg. Christ Jesus, I confess to wicked ingratitude. I confess my wicked ingratitude. - Sin. - Sin. Say your sins aloud. He needs to hear them. I can't. Please don't make me. Please. Say them. Say them. I have sinned and I'm afraid for myself and Kenny. There you are. Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were my boyfriend. - I came to your house, remember. - So you did. Are you following me then? No. I was just passing and I saw you. I'd like to talk to you. Well, my boyfriend hasn't turned up so I might as well. All right. Shall we go then? I've got my van outside. Drink. Drink of the Calvary Cup. Drink of the vinegar that he drank. Know something of Christ's sufferings at these hands, forever. No minister, please don't. Know something of the humiliation at Calvary. To atone you must be degraded as he himself was degraded. It was for you he died and now you sin. Drink. For you he knew untold contumerly. Drink! Taste the anguish. Drink! Unspeakable treachery. Drink! The treachery is yours. Your treachery! Know something of his hell on Calvary. Drink! Bless you my child. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. - What is this place? - This is where I work. - The swimming guard? - Yes. I'm the chief attendant. I've got an idea. - What's that? - Let's go for a swim. - At this time of night? - Well you've got keys to get in, haven't you? - Yes. - Well, come on then. - Are you the minister? - Yes. Good. My name is Patricia Lynch. - I'd like to talk to you. - Come this way. This Miss Lynch will need my help. You may go to your room. - How do you do? I'm... - How do you do? - So you want help. - I will... Sit down. - Is it a man? - What? A man. You're suffering at the hands of a man. Well, I'd hoped to marry him. I just found out he's already married. You gave yourself to him, I suppose? I think I may be pregnant. - I'm not sure. - Now you wish to give yourself to Christ? Christ is patient. He will understand. You knew of our church? I had heard of the brethren. I've been very desperate tonight. I've been walking around and... I passed outside and saw the sign. Thought I'd come in. Christ has guided your footsteps, child. Our leader, in matters of life, makes great demands upon us. Because he knows it is God's will. If we are to help you, you must be prepared to make great sacrifice. - What must I do? - You must live alone and only go out to worship or to preach the word of the brethren. Above all you must be obedient. For it is not I who speaks to you but Christ Jesus. But I've got to get money. I've got to go out to work. Of course. But any job must be approved by the brethren. No job must be at odds with the task Christ Jesus has set us. Do you accept? Yes. Then we will make you ready for induction. Cleansing. My sister, Mrs. Weyms, will officiate over your initial immersion. And will anoint you. Put on this garment. Remember, obedience, child. Here we go. - What are you doing? - Going for a swim of course. Well come on, don't just stand there. I'm not going swimming on my own. Come on, you're not shy, are you? Come on. Well come on. It isn't cold. What's the matter, haven't you had it under water? And he lives in Arizona? - Our leader...heard a voice... - What sort of voice? Telling him that the world is coming to an ens and that the day of damnation is upon us. And our brethren, are they rich? - Are there many of them? - But you will be safe now. - We, we will protect you. - Yes, but our leader, is our leader rich? Our leader says we will be saved. We will look after you. Take care of you. You will be loved. - Do you love me darling? - You're up late. - Waiting up for you. They're all potty. I mean really potty. You know what he let me in for, don't you? Up to there in a great tank of water. I nearly got half-drowned. - I told you but you wouldn't believe me. - I do now. So what are we going to do? I know what I'm going to do, start sniffing round. I can smell a story. If that minister's anything to do with it. He's a con merchant if ever I met one. Anyway I've started. How does this grab you for a title: 'Minister cons old ladies out of savings'. Not bad is it? What? - Have you got my insulin, nurse? Did the doctor telephone you? You know you should get Kenneth to inject you now and then. He said he knows how to. Suppose I couldn't get here one day. What would you do then? Mrs Weyms, are you all right? Has something happened? Mrs. Weyms? - Kenneth. - What about him? What about Kenneth? Nothing. Nothing's the matter. He'll be home soon. I think I'll just go and wash my hands. Will you be all right thee? I won't be a minute. You're all I needed, some nutcase bloody Bible thumper! Repent the day of retribution is at hand. What are you doing? Please, let me go! We are the brethren. The true believers. - God's only children! - Please don't! Some nutcase bloody Bible thumper! You'll perish. The day of retribution is at hand. - Quick! You've got to get out! - Shit man! Come on. We can hide. He's come back! Come on Paddy. For God's sake, come on! Darling. Do you love me as I love you? Don't let them get you... Don't let them take me... You've got your mummy. Did you...? Come Kenny... - Come away from it... What sort of child do you call yourself? Get out! Leave us alone! There now. Shall I read to you? I don't want you to have anything to do with Kenneth. - Do you understand? Mrs. Weyms, I hardly ever see him. Why should I? Just leave him alone. Mrs. Weyms, Mrs. Weyms, all I've ever said to you is that he should try should try to give you the injection himself. I won't let you see him. I won't let you see him! I won't let you talk to him. I won't let you have him a second time! I won't let you take him away from me. Mother, are you all right? She's just a bit upset, that's all. I'll give her a sedative. - What's going on? - Go away! Leave us alone. - She's saying that... - Go, go! Get out! Oh, Kenny. - You've got to be putting me on. - I'm not putting you on. Those tapes were genuine. I heard them. That is just the point. If you're so sure, go to the police. That is just the point. We're not that sure and we don't want to look silly. The least you could do is to try and help. Why don't you go and look? I am a doctor, not a detective. I'll tell you what you are, you're a bloody Burke! - Cool down Paddy. Paul's right. They won't even let him inside the front door. There are other ways you know. Not within the law. Believe me Paddy, I've tried. The only reason that Bridgette is allowed in is because of Mrs. Weyms' bad leg. - Well I'll get those tapes. I'll prove it to you! I...I didn't mean to hurt you. Not hurt you. - Come on, don't tell me you're shy? - I can’t. It's a sin. You see...he wouldn't let me. I'd be cast out. The minister, he...he... - What's this place? - This is where I work. - The swimming guard? - Yes, I'm the chief attendant. - I got an idea. - What's that? - Let's go for a swim. - At this time of night? - You've got a key to get in, haven't you? - Yes, well come on then. - Don't tell me you live on your own? - No, with my mother. - You want to try living on your own. - Do you, Kenny? - Someone your age... Do you want to try living on your own, Kenny? Oh no mother, I couldn't. Not that. Never. Not without you. Then you mustn't listen to a word that nurse tells you. She's wicked. Kenny...did you...go for a swim? - Yes. - And then? I...I baptised her, mother. We have a new convert, Kenny. She's a strange girl. She calls herself Patricia. I think I like her...very much. I, I anointed her, Kenny. - Good. - No. - No? - I anointed her, you see. And when I...when... She let me...touch her... I anointed her, you see. But when I... When she let me... touch her... But I had to, you see. I had to touch her. - Have you told me everything? - Yes. - I will pray for you child. - Please, minister, please. You see I... You know what you must do to atone? - Fast! - Foe seven days. She may touch only bread and water. But, you don't understand. I understand only what God wills. When you think of the suffering Christ himself had to endure. You're going to kill her. Your mother should be glad to fast. It is a God sent opportunity for her to re-affirm her belief. - My mother... - She's a good woman at heart. She takes insulin! If she fasts, she'll die. Insulin! may God forgive her. What are you saying? Don't you understand? She will only die if God wills it. - God's will! - There is nothing any of us can do. You're not going to kill her. What are you doing? - I'm going to sit with her. - I forbid you. Get from this house! - But someone must stay with her. - Beyond all redemption. You have shunned God's word. You have shunned our leader's teaching. Now we must shun you. Get from this household, from this holy place. And may we never see you again. You are as dead. - But I have proven... - You are filth and your filth is contagious. I forbid you to go near her. You're as evil as your father. Now get from this house! You may try to deceive me, child, but you cannot deceive the Almighty. What are you saying? Kenneth has told me. - Drugs. Insulin. - Deceit. I'm frightened. You've got to help me, minister. Only God can do that, child. Mrs. Weyms in her hour of need. It would be thy divine will, Christ Jesus, - that our sister sit on our right hand and bask in thy bountiful mercy. - Though she has sinned she has shown full contrition, regardless of fault for her purpose. Oh mighty God and merciful father, to whom alone belong to each in life and death. Look down from heaven, we come to beseech thee, with the eyes of mercy upon this child of our lives... - Amen. - Amen. Dear Christ Jesus, I have sinned. Dear Christ Jesus, hear my prayer. Mrs. Weyms, it's all right. I'll send for the doctor. You'll be all right soon. Doctor...no doctor! Kenny didn't mean... He didn't mean to hurt them. - Thank you. - Goodnight. They've gone to a better place. Kenny sent them to a better place. - A better place. What are you doing, child? - You're letting this happen. - God's will. You're mad! You're a murdering bloody lunatic! I'm going to get the doctor. Get out of my way! - It's forbidden. - I shall not let him pass the door. If he should try and force his way in I will send for the police. There's not a law in the land that stops me. You're killing her! Get out! Hold my hand. God is with you, sister. Be not afraid. - The Lord is my shepherd. - Paul, it's Paddy. - Yes? I'm at the Weyms'. You've got to get over here. It's Mrs. Weyms, she's dying. The minister's letting her die. I shall not want. - Please get over here quickly. - Find those tapes, anything. I'm on my way. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. Please, get Kenny. In green pastures. Get Kenny. Come now, sister. Be not afraid. - Christ is listening. Don't fail him now. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. Makes me... He leadeth... Come now...he needs to hear you. Christ Jesus I am truly contrite. ...the valley of the shadow of death... - Oh God, my kind host, the shepherd... Minister, I'm all dizzy. Everything... Dear God... Dear God! Christ Jesus, I have sinned. - I have sinned and I must atone for my sins through all eternity. There is no escape! I am his sword, his avenging angel. His brethren angel. The Lamb shall overcome for he, the Lord of laws and king of kings... The good Lord's teaching says: 'Put your hearts in order'. Yes, the Lord says! - I got a way. - What are you doing? My father should have stopped you. He tried. He didn't succeed. But I will. Now just mind out the way. - My child. - Get out of the way! You killed her. Put your house in order for my day of vengeance. And prepare to put your house in order. Germany, put your house in order! Russia, put your house in order! - It's all right. ♪ No walls to keep me in No chains to hold me down ♪ the shadows in my mind bind me to the ground ♪ Don't want to be a prisoner I know how I could be ♪ If the shadows in my mind would let me be free ♪ Set me free, set me free Want to find a peaceful place ♪ There must be a peaceful place Where I'll be free ♪ Set me free, set me free It remains a mystery ♪ If only I could find the key Then I'd be free ♪ But I can't get away There's a certain thing I know ♪ The shadows in my mind they won't let me go ♪ No walls can keep me in No chains can hold me down ♪ The shadows in my mind bind me to the ground ♪ Set me free, set me free I want to find a peaceful place ♪ There must be a peaceful place Where I'll be free ♪ Set me free, set me free It remains a mystery ♪ If only I could find the key Then I'd be free ♪ Then I'd be free
