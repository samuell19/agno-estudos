CURFEW In view of the immanent triumphant arrival of Emperor Napoleon in Milan By one hour after vespers each citizen shall be in their house and not in the street. Hey there, citizen! Don't move! He must be a conspirator. Come on! It was November 12, 1807. I remember it exactly. From that very morning I finally owned a copperplate press. A wonderful machine that in an hour did a day's work and with absolute precision. My tired fingers, full of cramp and cold, would have some rest. I remember with emotion the very first printed page. I couldn't realize it then, but that day my story and that of my family began, the history of Casa Ricordi. Marietta... Look how wonderful! What sharpness! And to think that you didn't want me to go to Leipzig to buy it. - This will make our fortune. - Yes, yes. I wonder how we'll pay for your copperplate printing press. Let people read my announcements and you'll see. - I stuck them everywhere. - At night, with a curfew. - You're so irresponsible. - Why? - Napoleon can attach his and I can't? - A fine comparison. With the difference that Napoleon, throughout the whole Empire, doesn't even have an heir, while I, instead, soon... Citizen Giovanni Ricordi? That's me. Are you going around attaching these sheets? - Yes. - Come with us. - Giovanni, dear me! - Let's not make a fuss. - We're in a hurry, let's go! - Oh, Giovanni! - Listen, please... Don't frighten her, she's going to have a baby. Pardon, madame. Nothing to fear. I'm not taking him to prison, but to the Teatro alla Scala. Best wishes, madame. At the... To La Scala?! To La Scala! Excuse me. - Sorry. - Me? What are you doing? Are you crazy? - You're crazy. - Me? - Do you know what this is? - Paper. - It's music! - Well? Di Cimarosa, signed. But it's sacrilege! All very fine stuff as you say, but it's only paper. - There's loads. - Where? Under the stage. There are tied up bundles, piled so high. May I? Excuse me. The superintendent is busy with Cavalier Barbaja. You'll have to wait. Monsieur Ricordi! Monsieur Ricordi, you can enter. The superintendent is waiting for you. Good morning, Ricordi. Come. I called you because I need in three days 200 copies of this anthem for marching which must be performed all over Milan for the arrival of His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon. You assure me that with this... What's it called? Copperplate printing press, Superintendent. I don't want to brag, but I'm the only one in all Milan to be able to deliver the 200 copies in three days. If you don't keep your commitment, I won't give you a penny. Very well. Indeed, I'll keep my commitment and you still won't give me a penny. - What? - I don't want money for my work. Bravo! Did you hear, Barbaja? You who doubt the civic sense of the Milanese. This is true patriotism. Yes, but, when people don't want money, then I start to worry. What does it mean "not a penny"? Well... For the job I would like the sheet music that is rotting under the stage. What sheet music? Waste paper. Old manuscripts of the works that have been presented at La Scala. But I prefer to do things properly. - How much do you want? - Superintendent, for that waste paper I can commit myself to provide La Scala forever for free all copies that are requested of me. Are you serious? Yes. It seems to me an acceptable proposal. - It's urgent, sir. - It's always urgent. - What's in your head? - That music will be lost! The rats eat it or the workers make hats out of it! - And you hope to make your coat, suit and shoes? - Yes. But not just me, those who wrote it too. Then we are understood, young man. You give me copies in time for the emperor's celebrations, undertake to be our copyist for free - and all the old scores are yours. - Very well, thank you very much. - Thank you too. - Best wishes. He's really crazy! I say he's not. - What are you doing? - Good morning, Mr. Monti. A little surprise for my clients. - Business goes well for you, then! - I can't complain. Ricordi Edition! Ricordi Edition! Terribly sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Ricordi. - Goodbye. And thanks. - Nice press. - Yeah. I bought it with the money you made me earn. How may I help you? I need the full scores of "The secret wedding" by Cimarosa, of "Anacreonte" by Cherubini and "The Barber of Seville" by Paisiello. - Do you have manuscripts? - At La Scala they told me that all the originals are in your hands! - Ah, yes. I forgot that now whoever wants copies of a work must turn to me. What price will you give me me now that you're mechanised? - 10 scudi. - 10 scudi ! But I've always paid you 10 lire! - Eh... Times have changed. - You have changed! You've become a profiteer! - Take that back! Bloodsucker, take it back! - Yes, I take it back! Listen to me. For years you've exploited the authors and me. And when I said you were paying little, you told me: "If you like, fine, if not, go elsewhere". Now it's I who say it to you! And that's not all. From now on you others must cough up for the musicians. But if they are already paid on delivery, with what right do you... With that of the author. And one more thing... Show more respect! Signor Giovanni! Here we are, labour pains! - Call the midwife, quick! - Me?! Oh God! But... The midwife... The midwife... - You... Go get the midwife. - Me? - Hurry! The corner of Santa Margherita. Come back in a week, you'll find all the scores. But hurry! - I'm going! Giovanni Ricordi and Son You know me? I'm dad. Dad. How small he is. What a voice! No, no, no. You don't have to be a singer. A publisher you'll be. How much work we'll have together! For now, however, there's not so much. But with you the "Casa Ricordi" is born and all the great musicians will come to us, right? And you will help them write masterpieces. Hurry up, because it says outside: "Giovanni Ricordi and son". What is it? It's done. We've christened the new sign. - Mister Giovanni! There's a customer! - A customer. Let's hope he pays well. Wait a moment, talk to the boss first. There he is. - What is it? - He says that for 12 lire it's still too expensive. Too expensive? You should know the prices. You're a theatre agent, right? Ah, I understand. Musician. Well... For you I'll do it for 3 lire only, okay? Of course, 3 lire isn't much, - only... - You don't even have those? "The touchstone". - It's a rather funny title for an opera. - I didn't choose it. "The Barber of Seville"! Here's a title, and what a plot! You're too late, Paisiello has already set it to music. And... your opera... - Have you found anyone to represent you? - I hope so. - Ragù? - Yes, for the tagliatelle. Well, give it back. I'll end up finding a copyist who'll credit me. - An imbecile! - More or less. I'm that imbecile. But you agree to leave me the manuscript. The better it goes, the more it earns. A system invented by me. - What if it's a fiasco? - We'll share that too. - I like the risk. - And I like ragù. Deal done. If you invite me to lunch, of course. - Rosina, lay another plate! Come. - Thank you. I kept inviting him to lunch for many months. It didn't take me long to understand that the better Rossini ate, the better he worked. I managed to have him write one masterpiece after another. One day the impresario Barbaja signed him and took him to Naples. The Neapolitan cuisine is certainly not inferior to that of my Marietta and so the successes continued. It wasn't indigestion that stopped them. - Rascal, coward, traitor! - Slave driver, usurer, thief! A nice way to act. You should be ashamed! - But I swear... - Domenico, please. - You haven't bought up my whole life! - Some gratitude! If I not for me, you'd be playing a mandolin in a tavern! I work as I like, where I like and when I like! Yes, go to Rome. Go do "The Barber of Seville". We'll see how you'll manage after Paisiello! You've lost a friend, remember! You'll regret planting me mid-season like an artichoke! I... I even asked him to be best man at our wedding. What an imbecile I am! ♪ Lo in the smiling sky, ♪ ♪ the lovely dawn is breaking, ♪ ♪ and you are not awake, ♪ ♪ and you are still asleep? ♪ - Damn, my sauce! - It's the third time you've interrupted me. Wretch! Maestro, maestro! - Maestro, do you realize? - Yes, but... I'll put in some red wine. It's better. Want to taste? In two weeks we go on stage and you're still on the first act! Don't shout so much, I'll ruin the sauce. I've already told you it's all in my head, I only have to write it. - Please don't set foot here again. - What? I am tired of hearing your shouting, you'll ruin the opera too. Come on Alright. I'll give you another 5 days. - An hour late and I'll apply the penalty! - Yes. Come on, out! Isabella... Isabella, don't be cross with me. I had to leave suddenly for the new contract. Why did you leave me like this, without a word, not even a farewell? I don't count for you, do I? It is precisely because you matter too much that I left. Should I play hide and seek between you two? Have him come through one door while you leave out the other? Compose music next to you and play it to him immediately afterwards? No, no. There is another way: - tell him everything frankly. - Yes sure. But how can one do it? He always talks to me about you. You should have tried yourself. Do you believe it's that easy? He always talks about your music. He's in a dead end, Barbaja. And yet, I owe everything to him. - I can't steal his woman. - You've already stolen her. I can't love him anymore. But before you left, you could at least say goodbye, if only a word. No... I don't like goodbyes. Without orchestra accompaniment. And then, I distrust tears, I never know how to dry them. But what do you want? I'm no hero. I'm rather... a Pulcinella. And like a clown you also joke about serious things. Isabella... Do you think the trip to Rome only cost me the ticket? I thought so much of you that I forgot everything, music, singers, impresario, everything. Even the sauce on the stove! Gioachino! - What is it? - Look. - Where? - Down there. - Of course he was spying on you. - I thought he was in Caserta on business. If he thinks I'm afraid, we'll show him! Come. Hide. In here. Don't be afraid, I'm here. We have to decide. - Tell him everything, please. - Yes, sure. But for now don't move. Here. - Well... - Well? You didn't expect to see me here? - Really... - Water under the bridge, I forgive you. Besides, you couldn't have done otherwise. - Honestly, no. - Tell the truth, you lost your mind. - Completely. - Only, you're not the first. - What? "What"... Paisiello has already set it to music, you know, don't you? - Ah! You came to talk... - Of "The Barber of Seville", yes. - Where are you at? - I've to deliver the opera in 5 days. 5 days? Then you did nothing. Like in Naples, always chasing women! There's a convent nearby. Listen, Maestro Rossini, Paisiello's admirers in Naples consider it an insult that a youngster like you allow yourself to make a copy of "The Barber". And want to destroy your opera by their whistling. The theatre has been sold out for a week. Know where the tickets are? In the hands of Paisiello fanatics. - What music you'll hear! Not yours, theirs. - Better. I hesitated and now I'm determined. Look, I think I already have a cue for the slander aria. I don't want this music to be whistled at! Listen to me. Write a nice letter to Paisiello now, with your heart on your sleeve. Paisiello will be moved and you won't be bothered. - Think so? - I'll ask him to compose something for San Carlo. And I'll also give him some nice advance. Listen... - You really are a friend. - Leave it, I know you can't say "thank you". But admit it was a dirty trick walking out on me. You have to admit it. Don't make me talk nonsense. "Distinguished or Very Distinguished Maestro"? As you wish. Me I'd write the whole letter very clearly so that he understands what you say. Put that you consider him your teacher, that your work is a kind of homage - and that you don't even hope to equal his. - Very true. - My "barber" will shave him. - I'm sure, but don't dream of writing it. The Neapolitans adored you, we hope they forgive you as I forgave you. Done. Very good. A little short, but it will do. I'll leave then. See you on the day of the premiere. Isabella will be there too, you know? I think the change of air will benefit her. - She's not been too well these past few days. - Thank you. I owe you so much. Get that slander aria down before you forget it as always. Yes. Yes, you did well to leave. And now it would be wrong of me... to stay. - Sforza Cesarini is not at home, he's at the Argentina Theatre. - Fine. Let's go to the Argentina! Come on, sing! - Come on! - What shall I do? Enough, it sucks! Did you see what happened? Out! Come on! Go on! Go on! Silence. Silence! Silence! I said "silence"! Thus ends the first performance of "The Barber of Seville" by Gioachino Rossini. As for you, gentlemen whistlers, I am sure you have been paid better than our performers and whoever directed it is certainly better than me. We congratulate you on your success and we offer you our applause! Do you know, dear? Mr. Giovanni Ricordi. - How could this happen? - Well, it happens. - You promised Rossini you would stop it. - Who told you that? - Rossini himself. - You believe it? Not me. - What are you saying? - I don't believe you either, my dear. Don Bartolo lets himself be hoodwinked, not me. You should have known. It was you! - You! - My dear, please. - What wrong did he do you? He did it to himself and me to avoid doing you wrong. True, we love each other, but we haven't betrayed you. You can ignore what loyalty means, you've always ignored it. But he doesn't! Isabella! Performed at very popular prices - What happens? - I took over the show. The impresario has a 39° fever and dropped everything. 40 to be exact. I saw him a little while ago. I had the same idea, but you were quicker. Yes, I'm sorry, okay? And you were right, it's a great work. - Where's Rossini? - Who knows? He's not been seen at theatre or home. The work will be fine all the same as there are no people from yesterday! See you later. Young man, let me see me a moment. A place in the gallery. - Weren't you here yesterday too? - Of course I was there. - I was the only one who applauded. Look here. - Yeah. - Why are you coming back? - Return punches if necessary. Rossini is a genius. I understand him, I'm a musician too. Musician? Change this gallery for a good seat in the stalls. Musician... Your name? Donizetti, Gaetano Donizetti. - Donizetti? - With a single "Z". - Here's my card. - Thank you. If you pass through Milan, come and see me. But you don't even know me. You appreciate Rossini, you are young, a musician. For me a young musician is always a hope. Go, it's starting. Baked pears. Baked pears! Want one, maestro? Tonight no? - News of Isabella? - She left the hotel around 8:00 pm and hasn't come back yet. ♪ Ready for everything by night or by day, ♪ ♪ always in bustle, in constant motion. ♪ ♪ A better lot for a barber, ♪ ♪ a nobler life does not exist. ♪ ♪ La la la la. ♪ ♪ Razors and combs, lancets and scissors, ♪ ♪ at my command everything's ready. ♪ ♪ Then there are "extras", ♪ ♪ part of my trade ♪ ♪ business for ladies ♪ ♪ and cavaliers… ♪ ♪ Business for ladies... ♪ ♪ And cavaliers... ♪ ♪ Ah, what a merry life, ♪ ♪ what gay pleasures, ♪ ♪ What gay pleasures ♪ ♪ for a barber of quality! ♪ ♪ All call for me, ♪ ♪ all want me, ♪ ♪ ladies and children, ♪ ♪ old men and maidens. ♪ ♪ I need a wig, ♪ ♪ I want a shave, ♪ ♪ leeches to bleed me, ♪ ♪ here, take this note. ♪ ♪ All call for me, ♪ ♪ all want me. ♪ ♪ I need a wig, I want a shave, ♪ ♪ here, take this note. ♪ ♪ Figaro, Figaro... ♪ ♪ Heavens!

I have to start all over again. I have to regain the trust of the public, of the impresarios. And that's not enough. Finding confidence in myself. This is the most difficult thing. I don't know if I'll have the courage to start all over again. You will find the courage. Love, you have already left me once and I suffered so much. I don't want to lose you again. Come. Look!

Give it to Signor Giovanni. - Are you making fun of me? - Less chatter, go. Your name is Ricordi? Give it to your master and add that it's Donizetti, with only one "Z". You should have understood that when I say no it's no and when I say yes it's yes! I told you it wasn't the right time. I'm not in the chorus! And I marvel at you, Mr. Ricordi, backing up these two exploiters! If you think to take advantage because I'm a woman, you're mistaken! - Who's in there? - Virginia Marchi, she sings at the Carcano Theatre. - If she sings like she screams, a real phenomenon. - They fight to hear her. And she fights with the impresarios who don't listen to her. A plague. You're exaggerating. Enough of your demands! Stop! I have a contract and you'll respect it! Engage the tenor I've chosen or I'll go to court! - You're blackmailing us! - Call it what you like, I don't care. But I'll win the case and seize the theatre from you! - A fine woman. - Yes, but I want nothing to do with her. I do. There's nothing to do. I know Virginia well. - I was hoping my mediation... - What a tigress! You know how cold gets to me. Well, I've never warmed up so much. Yesterday the costumes, today that cheap poseur. Tomorrow it will certainly be the start date of the performances. She does nothing but cause trouble. Mr. Giovanni... - What is it? - There's a man who insists on talking to you. You don't say "a man", you say "a gentleman". Perhaps one says so, but he certainly isn't. Donizetti. - He's here? - It was you who insisted on engaging her. - She's a great singer! - Yes! But I'd do anything to get rid of her! Maybe I have an idea. Virginia has an iron contract: costumes, scenes, dates, artists, everything must be approved by her. Or by him, right now. Yes, now she has this whim for the tenor Maselli. - If we don't bend over... - Pay the penalty. If not Maselli, she'd invent something else. No. She surely devises things up at night. I say it, but... - If I'm not mistaken, she has no right to refuse an opera. - Ah, no! - What's that got to do with it? - If you put up a new opera - and Virginia doesn't like it and refuses to sing it... - Maybe! It would be she who broke the contract. But what do we know that Virginia will refuse? I know her, I told you. I have a work that Virginia will slap in our faces. An indescribable hodgepodge, a mess, one of those... Have you nothing to do? Well? It's by Donizetti. - His last work flopped. - Is it really bad? - I'm an expert, right? - It's done! Do you have the score? - More than that, I have the author. - He's out there waiting for me. - Fine, thanks! You are the Napoleon of publishers. You'll thank me later. Donizetti... - Dear Donizetti, how's it going? - Fine, thanks. Do come in. - Maestro Gaetano Donizetti. - What a pleasure! We read your opera, it's wonderful. - New, magnificent! Bravo! - Bravo! ♪ Softly a furtive teardrop fell ♪ ♪ shadowed her sparkling eyes ♪ ♪ Seeing the others follow me ♪ ♪ has caused her jealous sighs ♪ ♪ What is there more to prize? ♪ ♪ What is there... ♪ No, no, no! You're falling! Don't you realise? Sustain the note! Up, up! "Up, up"! I couldn't even get up there with a fire ladder! Dear Maselli, if I were a fireman holding onto his ladder, I certainly wouldn't lend it to you. I've been trying to get something into your head for half an hour! Yet there's a lot of void, good God! How dare you, the author of this jingle?! Shut up, dog! You're fired! Out! Outside, before you're forced to use your lousy voice to shout for help! We'll see what Miss Marchi will say about it. - We'll see! - What is it? I fired Maselli. What? You've fired Maselli? At the first reading? Sorry if I've been so late. Oh, good. I'd like to point out that the rehearsal was scheduled for 10:00 am. It's almost 11:00 and the soprano is nowhere to be seen. - I won't work like this! - You're quite right, maestro! - But I'm convinced... - Good morning. - Here she is! - Good morning. - Good morning, Miss. - Good morning. Good morning. Have you read the score? We'd like to hear your opinion. My opinion is that I'll end up suing the lot of you. - You won't get rid of me like this. - I'm very sorry, but we believed that the opera... - Who mentioned the opera? It's the dressing room you gave me. You couldn't find a dirtier, darker, wetter one! I care about my voice, and you should too, that's where your earnings come from! You must excuse us, miss, but we didn't think... Who should sing this stuff, me or you? - Does that mean you'll sing this opera? - Of course! - Thanks, it's very kind of you. - The author? Bravo, I like you music. It doesn't happen very often. Mister author, at your command. Maria... I wish everyone to leave the stage. During rehearsals I can't stand distractions. And where is Mr. Maselli? He'll be running after some cat. - You've... - Yes, he's a dog. I thought I'd replace him with a singer. Well, let us start. That's how you freed us of this mad woman, huh? But it looks like she's settled down. You assured us that the work was bad. I was lying! I knew instead that it was beautiful. But I also knew you wouldn't accept to stage a work by a composer under a cloud.

Bravo! - Donizetti! - Bravo! - How hot! I'm sweating! - Bravo! Thank you, Ricordi! - Bravo! - You were right. Bravissimo! Come in. Virginia, I hate melodramatic ways, but allow me to devotedly kiss your hand. You were magnificent, sublime! Hackneyed words, but I can find no others. How to thank you, for your goodwill during rehearsals, for your precision, your punctuality. They told me you were a sort of tigress, instead you're an angel. I owe my first real success to you. One moment, don't think it's all over. - I owe a debt to you too. - What? This will teach you to humiliate me in front of people, firing my tenor, putting on airs like a great man and always giving orders! Now you know that Virginia Marchi never leaves an outstanding account. And pays in hard cash. Unbearable third rate composer! For two months this slap has been burning my fingers! Now it's done. Now you can leave. May I at least ask you why you put up with me so much? Why? Strange question. I'm sorry, but you always do the opposite of what I expect and I'm caught unprepared. If you'll allow, this time I'd like to live up to the situation. Remember, son, often in life to get something you have to ask the opposite. - Understand? - No, dad. It's better this way. What a thing to teach a child! I was telling him for when he grows up. Right, Tito? I always kept my father's words in mind. Even before growing up, the theory of asking the opposite of what one wants came in handy on many occasions. Strange, it was with my father that I got the best results. I started not wanting the rocking horse, then not wanting long trousers, then absolutely wanting him to make me work harder, even on the night shift. - Adieu, mon amour. A bientôt. - To the station. Écris-moi! Je t'attends à Paris! Ambrose... - Mr. Tito, good morning. - Hello. Has Dad already arrived? - An hour ago. - Damn! Give me your duster. If the old man still sees me in coat-tails, he'll eat me alive. Mr. Tito, the night is made for bed. I say so too. And I always find some little woman who agrees. - And that? - It's the title page of "La sonnambula". - Still here? It's urgent! - No lithography. You father ordered to engrave it in copper, he doesn't like new ideas. But it's a shame. You didn't do it right, I know how to convince him. Let me do it. - About time! - Good morning, dad. I heard talk of lithography for this title page, is it true? No, I said copperplate! They're all gaga! I said, "How is that possible? Dad isn't the type to take risks." "He drags his heels in these things!". I was right. Eh? What's this? Who's dragging his heels? You do well. You never know what comes out with this lithograph. Let us leave these things to the Vallardi Brothers. - Why the Vallardi? - They've been doing it for a while. Listen to that idiotic talk. Are we less than the Vallardi? I'm against it. If you want to take responsibility... Sure I'll take it! Get it done in lithography, alright? - Really? - Do you take me for a silly old fuddy-duddy? No, dad. Neither old nor a fuddy-duddy. Nor silly. - Not even the time to change, this time. - Well... Where did you spend the night? - Women, of course. - No, dad, friends from the university. Ah, well, then... the fuddy-duddy is you. As soon as it's ready I'll send a copy to Bellini in Paris. - Of course. - All right. Wait! About Bellini, I wanted to talk to you. I'm worried. - What's the matter? - I haven't heard from him for two months. He didn't even show up for rehearsals of "The Puritans". - Strange. - I wrote to Rossini, he replied that he'd never seen him. - Miss Grisi will certainly know something. - No. Rossini wrote to me that they broke up. He's involved with another woman. He'd found the woman who was right for him, simple, calm, serene. It would also have benefited his health. No, sir. - What can one do, dad? - I don't know. That boy worries me. Maybe someone should be sent to Paris. But don't think of sending me, dad! - Why not? - I can't go, I'm busy here. What? What? Have you made up your mind to be indispensable here? I'm not saying that, I just don't want to go to Paris. And then... I'd rather not. - You don't want to go? - No. Then I won't send you to Paris. - You'll stay here, my dear young man. - What's with you, dad? It is that... I've taught you this little game. I still have enough brains to remember. If you had as much as I have, the shop would run much better. You're a good-for-nothing, you just like to have fun! I'll go to Paris. Out of the way. - Dad... - Scram! But I say... - Good morning, Mr. Tito. - Hello. - Good morning. Lithograph, immediately. Good morning. - By tonight. - Mr. Tito, some proofs must be done. It's the first time. If you're wrong? Once it's engraved, it's engraved. - Is the stone ready? - Yes, Mr. Tito. - Give it to me. Clear up here. - Where are the burins? - Immediately. - It's a nice job! - Magnificent! - You can say so. - It deserves a bonus. Bravo! What's going on? Not working? Go wash and change immediately, or you won't be on time for departure. Come on! I was in Paris for 5 wonderful but too short days ahead of me. I had no time to waste. I'd have gone straight to the theatre to Miss Grisi, A woman in love and disappointed is worth more than 10 policemen. I would have known something for sure, just to obey dad and please him. Personally I was more than relaxed about Vincenzo Bellini, but this time, unfortunately, I was wrong. Au plus tôt, as soon as possible. - She keeps running after him. - After whom? - Him, always to him. - Bellini? Looks like he's sick now. - I'll wait for you, ma'am. - Yes. I won't stay long. Belfagor, quiet! What is it? Don't you recognize me anymore? Go to the kennel, come on! Ah, it's you. What are you doing here? Good evening. I'd like to know how he is. The first performance is on Tuesday, you must talk to him. Don't worry, miss, he and I will be on strictly professional terms. - Don't be afraid. - Me, afraid? I think you're mistaken, ma'am. Especially since Bellini isn't here. - What? - Yes, he's much better. To heal completely he went to the countryside for a few days. - Where? - Plombière, but he'll return for the premiere of "The Puritans". - To Plombière this season? - Yes, he got this idea and when he gets an idea in his head. But you know only too well, don't you? - Congratulations on your tact. - And mine for your obstinacy. Yes, it's true, in that respect we're not alike. - I would have accompanied him. - He preferred to go alone. He didn't want you to follow him. Then your right, he's completely healed. Anyway, he's completely cured of you. And I can assure you that there is no danger of a relapse, therefore I advise you to give up your trips here. And I wish you goodnight, ma'am. Doctor... Who was it? I don't know, Signor Bellini, a woman. - Where did Luisa go? - She's coming up, don't fret. Here she is! - Who was it? - Nobody. A woman who wanted to know if the house was for sale. What is it? Strange, I had the impression of recognizing that way of ringing the bell. Why did friends forget me? My love, calm down. Yesterday I went looking for Rossini, but he's no longer in Paris, otherwise he would certainly have come. - Has the premiere been set? - Not yet, but we'll know soon. And so, I have nothing more to say, Mr. Ricordi. Except that eternal loves, as they call them, last no longer than the others. I don't see any mystery in it. It's simply... A man passing from the arms of one woman to those of another, as in the quadrille. But it doesn't matter, does it? The dance continues. Sorry, Giulia. There's no need to apologize. All of Paris laughs at Grisi. It seems to me impossible that he didn't show up tonight at the premiere. Of course he's hidden somewhere. And we'll see him pop up at the first applause. - I know my colleagues. - The Lord willed it! It would be so nice, not for me, but for him and for the opera. We had so looked forward to this day. We wanted, if it was a success, to celebrate it alone, he and I. Come, hurry. Do you want an empty stage? And keep the tears for the great duet, you'll need them all. Go. Doctor... Doctor! So, Doctor, is he any better? Tell me something! Today I'm really worried. This agitation that increases by the minute... Yet he never sees anyone, I watch over him. You watch him too much. It's a cure I didn't prescribe. All the more reason to do it. Ever since you've treated him... Listen to me, miss, the situation is so serious that I cannot hide the truth from you. This absurd and suffocating love of yours is slowly killing him. - You're crazy! Your insolence... - It's not insolence, miss, it's a diagnosis. When passion overcomes certain limits, it becomes a monstrosity, which only pathology can define. You say terrible things! You've deprived Bellini of his friends, of his work, of all that still gave him the strength to live. And if life leaves him now, it's your fault, - your terrible jealousy. - Doctor! You didn't even allow Rossini to approach him. He who has helped him so much and who loves him like a brother. Because you're ashamed to let people know to what a pitiful state you've reduced Vincenzo Bellini. Get out! Get out of here! And you never come back, did you hear me? Never again! Stefano... - Stefano! - Ma'am. Go to the pharmacy and get the medicine. - I'm going right away. - Hurry up! - Yes Ma'am. ♪ Here his voice, his voice so gentle ♪ ♪ Invoked my name then died away ♪ ♪ Vows of love and truth he plighted ♪ ♪ Vows of love, vows of love ♪ ♪ And then, oh cruel, ♪ ♪ And then, oh cruel, scorned to stay. ♪ ♪ Never more ♪ ♪ shall we, united, ♪ ♪ Never more, shall we, ♪ ♪ united taste the joy... ♪ - Any news? - Nobody knows a thing about him.

I think of the friends who abandoned me and I have no compassion for your sacrifice for me. Quiet! I pushed your friends away. Yes, me. I didn't know I'd hurt you so much. I never knew. And the Grisi? I didn't even apologize to her. A love that lives on the pain of others is monstrous. Our love is not monstrous. There is nothing greater, stronger than our love.

After almost 40 years I decided to leave the old house, where I was born and where my father had recently passed away. But, like people, companies grow when they are healthy, so I chose a larger and more beautiful location in via degli Omenoni. It was March 18, 1848. But if that date has gone down in history, it wasn't the on account of Casa Ricordi. - Ambrose, what's going on? - Nothing, the usual demonstrations. They've heard that Palermo has risen up and don't want to be left behind. Ah, God willing! A fine day we chose to move. Let's hope my son doesn't get caught up in it. Halt! - What are you doing? - We're moving house. And you, when? Pass! You've notified the police? Yes. You must notify them even if you need to scratch yourself. - Jawohl! Check load. - Why? Be good, sir. Keep calm. What are these papers? What do you want them to be? Music, manuscripts, sheet music. Let's see. - "The Lombards at the first crusade" by Giuseppe Verdi. - Who's he? - Never heard of him. - Sooner or later you will, and also his music. - Was? He says, at the theatre. You'll go when you have a day of leave. Weg! Gut! Weg. - What's up? - Our men occupied the Governor's palace. The Austrians are disarming the civic guard! In Borgo Monforte it's bedlam, let's run! I was sorry to leave our old home. He was so fond of it, poor dad. Ambrose... - I'm worried about Giulio. - Don't worry. He's a serious, peaceful boy with his head on his shoulders. - What's going on? - The Austrian cavalry! - They passed Piazza del Duomo! - We must cut them off! Come, there's a wagon! We must make a barricade! Come on! - Move the cart! - Whip the horse! Come on! - Take the mattress! - Halt! Stop here. - Watch out, they're coming! - Long live Italy! - Can you use it? - I hope so. - Bravo! When I said that Casa Ricordi had no merit in those glorious days, in a way I was wrong. My son Giulio, I knew later, fought like an old soldier, and was only 16 years old. That evening he came home for a moment to hug me and say goodbye. He went to Turin to join the army of Carlo Alberto. Leaving he was a child. I would see him again a grown man. If I can today, with confidence towards myself, accept the management of the company that my father, to give himself a well-deserved rest, entrusts with me, and if I can look to the future with serenity, I owe it to you, Maestro Verdi. The words you said to me when I wanted to persist in continuing my military career have remained etched in my mind: "Your duty is to continue the work of Giovanni and Tito Ricordi". This duty has become my pride. Because I'm proud, however small my contribution may have been, to have continued in his shadow the uninterrupted repetition of his successes which are the affirmation and triumph of Italian melodrama in the world. And if one day I too can, like my father, deserve a little rest, I will have the joy of remembering my whole life listening again to your music, for my every step has been accompanied by the echo of your notes. Ever since, as a boy on the barricades, I sang "The choir of the Lombards". Bravo, Giulio. Beautiful words. But remember that your father here and your grandfather up there expect music from me, facts from you. ♪ A joke or madness ♪ ♪ is such a prophecy. ♪ ♪ A joke or madness ♪ ♪ is such a prophecy. ♪ ♪ How their credulity ♪ ♪ amuses me! ♪ ♪ How their credulity ♪ ♪ amuses me! ♪ ♪ A joke! ♪ ♪ Madness! ♪ ♪ How their credulity ♪ ♪ amuses me! ♪ ♪ How their credulity ♪ ♪ amuses me! ♪ ♪ Their credulity amuses me! ♪ - What does it say? - Nothing.

Goodbye, Giulio. What did I tell you? Abroad, music is renewed and we're still at the brass band. - They say Wagner is too difficult. - Who says so? Those who impose a monopoly of Verdi's music on us. Aren't we enough to fight them? - Yes, but all we do is talk. - Quite right! Tonight we'll start with whistling. No whistles! Wagner's music will be enough to bury him! Well done! Well done. To enhance Wagner, you want to bury Verdi! Poor deluded fools! At war you sang his hymns and it took away your fatigue and fear. When music reaches this point, there is no need to change your mind to destroy it. Even Farewell, my Darling, Farewell was sung. - But the war is over and Verdi too! - Wagner will come to Italy, this is what we're all fighting for. Wagner or Verdi? Music ancient or modern? Maestro Verdi renew or die Notes for Otello Giuseppe, what are you doing? A week ago they sent the census sheet and now they've come to get it, do you want it?

If nothing else, I could see what an absurd crime you're committing. And if you won't listen to me, listen to Boito. My opinion may not count for much, but I'm a musician too and I wrote the libretto of "Othello" for you. I swear that Shakespeare himself would be proud of how you set his drama to music. What you've destroyed is the most beautiful music I have ever heard. It is evident that neither you nor Shakespeare have heard of Wagner. - Giuseppe... - Only a bunch of fanatics could do this. Your audience has waged war and today works in the cities and countryside, they have the right to your music! - That's just words! You might even convince me. But don't you understand that it is I who no longer trust myself, that something is broken here inside? In short... I've made an irrevocable decision. There's no going back! Understand? Maestro, don't get in any trouble. Beppe, where's the maestro going? - For a document at the Parma registry. - Parma? Here! Come on, in order! Don't be afraid. We must no longer allow our rights to be trampled on! Sound the alarm! To your positions! Let's go! Stop! Save your breath! Go back! Don't force us to shoot! We are not afraid!

Pack the bags, Puccini will need a friend. - Rather than suspend his salary, I have faith in that young man. - Yes, sir. Huge success in Turin for Puccini's "Manon". Puccini and the publisher Ricordi leave for Paris to find a historical drama by subject. The group carved in bronze depicts peace on a chariot pulled by a quadriga and surmounts the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, masterpiece of the imperial style. Inspired by the arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, it was erected in 1806 to celebrate Napoleon's victories and was placed in the centre between the left and right wing of the Louvre palace. The grandeur of this architectural complex is underlined from the view of the Tuileries gardens, designed by the architect Le Notre, who also supervised the gardens of Versailles. It is almost impossible to imagine the enormous work needed for the construction of the Palace of Versailles. Suffice it to say that only after 23 years... "Palace de Versailles" would be a nice title, wouldn't it? Yes... The central body of the building built by Le Vau is flanked, according to the wishes of Louis XlV, with two wings designed by Mansart. Louis XlV devoted a large part of his life to supervise and direct the work for the construction of Versailles. You can see him here checking the layout of the famous gardens. Around him, the great artists of the time: Le Brun, Le Notre, Hardouin, Mansart. A little aside, on your right, Jean Racine converses with La Fontaine and on the left Madame de Maintenon, recently the King's morganatic bride, talks with Vauban, Marshal of France. And now please follow me to the gallery of the Revolution. In 1792, the royal family was imprisoned in the temple tower. In this tableau, Queen Marie Antoinette passes out at the news of the murder of her friend, the Princess of Lamballe, victim of the revolutionaries. Around her the two children: the Dauphin and Madame Royale, dramatically posed. Madame Elizabeth, sister of the King, and Cléry, valet. King Louis XVI, to one side, listens to the noises rising from the street. Please note the realistic details and... Giacomo... Off you go, see you at 18:00 at the Archevêché bridge. Cigar? No thanks. Well then? We leave tomorrow morning. I've got tickets to Milan. OK, as you wish. It had been a wasted journey. But the fault was mainly mine, for being fixated on historical drama. I read that book many years ago. A French comrade in arms lent it to me. I often read a passage in the evening. It was a sad and carefree story at the same time, like our youth and the war we waged. Come on, Giacomo, maybe this is it. And the book? - It's 2 francs. - Oh, yes. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - What would you like? - Cigarettes. If you keep playing like this, I'll throw you off the Eiffel Tower! And who goes up there! They told me there are no elevators. These here. - How much it is? - 5 sous. Could you tell me where I could find the Café... Momus? Café Momus?! If you've got a date, I fear you'll find her rather aged! It's a long time since there was any Café Momus. I'm sorry. Give the gentleman a calendar, so he can see we're in 1895. It's long gone, Murger's Scenes of Bohemian Life. Murger... Someone still remembers him in the neighbourhood. Of course, he owed everyone money! Poets, what a disaster! They eat and drink and always on credit. - Thank you, Mr. Felix. Good evening. - Good evening. Bohemian Life now that there's the Eiffel Tower, just think! Good evening. Another poet. Miss... If I may, I'll carry one of your packages. Sorry, I've not the pleasure of knowing you. - Actually it was you who spoke to me first. - Me? - Yeah. It's possible, but we were in public. Alone it's different. Sir, my pleasure. You see? Happy now? It's your fault! If you hadn't stopped me, I'd have kept my balance... What a pity! I can repay you. But if I haven't paid yet! - Let's do a rough account. - Fancy words! - One can see you're a foreigner. - As you wish. Miss, I've the pleasure of saying goodbye. Now you leave me in trouble? Very nice! Here, take it. Let's hurry, at least. - Don't you want to know who I am? - No. But it would be fun guessing. A doctor. You say so because you don't like doctors. Not at all, they're often kind. I like artists and doctors. Others can throw themselves at my feet or into the Seine, I don't care one bit. I'm not a doctor. I'm a musician. - There's not much difference. You play the violin? - No, piano. Ah. It must be nice all the same. I don't play the piano very often, but I have others play it. I write music. - Songs? - No, operas. - Performed in theatres? - Of course. - I love the theatre! Will you invite me? - Yes. - Hey, you're kidding me? - No. Thank you. Give it to me. And what do you do? You haven't told me yet. Guess. Let's see, let's see... Give me your hand. No, the life line isn't well drawn, it's all zigzag and it's short. - How many needle holes! - Yes, I do daywork. Before I was a model, but now I've stopped. - But why? - It's too cold in the attics. Heavens, my friends will be worried. - Where are they? - At my place! We're taking advantage of the owner's absence. But it's difficult to explain, come on! Where have you put it, light of my life, the luxurious dinner for our porters? - I lost everything in the street. - I'm sorry, it's my fault. No, it's my fault. Well, both of us. And now the presentations. My friends: Marcello, painter, and Roberto, sculptor. - At the moment, porter. I told you I hate the owners because my... - He wants to seize her furniture. - You're taking it away? No, we're bringing it to Sebastiano. And they're safe there, I paid the rent. This is Sebastiano, a philosopher who's writing a book. Yes, to prove that every exertion is futile. - Mister... - Giacomo Puccini, musician. - A pleasure. - Delighted. So, Sebastiano, would you exert yourself? - It's contrary to my principles. - Maria! - We'd be rather hungry. - But you didn't bring anything. Then, at Felix's place. - You're coming too, eh? - Yes, we'll join you. - Fine. Here we are, this is my palace. How much would you need to make peace with the owner? Don't think of it, furniture's made to be transported. Just don't get too attached to it. And then, when I'm sad, I have the roofs of Paris. Nice to live on the top floor. I don't like them walking overhead. - You have canaries too! - I told you I like music. I'll go and make some coffee. - Weren't you due to have dinner at Maria's? - Yes. But for once we decided to eat. Poor Maria. When she comes we must keep her happy. - Yes, she told me she's leaving tomorrow. - For the cure in Provence. - Then it's serious! - So says the doctor. - Will they give your new opera here? - No, in Italy. - Too bad, I won't be there. - You will, because I invite you. My impresario here in Paris will work out the trip. I can see you in the theatre crowd. Yes, in the first row of the gallery. I love the gallery. Wouldn't you like to be seated in the stalls, at least for once? No, I don't want to get into bad habits. - When will it be? - Who knows? I hope it will be next winter. - Winter's a long way off. - Maria... Maria... Time passes quickly. I'll remember. - Why don't you answer me? - Be quiet. What's wrong? I'm so happy to have met you. Ah, be quiet! Did I say something to upset you? - My friends downstairs are waiting for me. - I'll come too. - No!
