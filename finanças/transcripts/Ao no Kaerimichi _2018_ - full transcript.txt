Hey! Is there anyone there? You're slow! You can't go! You won't go there! What school is that? You're way too slow! Ao no Kaerimichi. We're free! Freedom! This is the best! That's dangerous! You're such a kid! The ocean! Let's go to the ocean! That sounds good! You told me that I'm going to have the same future as my teacher! That's what we all think! That kind of job won't sustain me. You dummy! Women are working a lot more these days! Shut up! We are free! What are you doing Riri? It must be nice to have something you wanna do huh? You can think about it after you go to Tokyo. I wonder? You should take some photos of me in Tokyo! I really like the photos you take. Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you talking about? Stupid! Why Tokyo? What's so good about that place? She's not the same as you. She has a dream! That's right! A dream? As a singer? How can she be a singer in this country? Ain't that right Tatsuo? I want to go to Tokyo with her. Are you being for real? He is! We'll never invite you to one of our concerts! That's right! Even if you invite me, I'm not going! He said it! Did you hear him? I'm not going!! Hey! Hey! That's dangerous! No way! You just force people to drink! Our store is a respectable place. That's right. Alright! I'll be waiting for you tonight. Okay! Okay! Okay! Hey look at this. It's saying that the suicide rates for young people is at an all time high. Why would you kill yourself? If you knew then you wouldn't kill yourself. That is true I guess... You know what? Your teacher called me. They said you're going to Tokyo? Are you for real? You should know that our family doesn't have that much money. I will work to earn the money to support myself. Tokyo huh? What do you want to do in Tokyo? Are you going to be a photographer or something? You shouldn't do that. We aren't that kind of family. Then what kind of family should we be? A family with an artistic atmosphere or something like that. Our family has a ton of artistic skills! How? I can sing very well. I've never heard you sing. You know what? This is your own life. Even if you fail, you can be just like me. That's not funny... By the way... what happened with that girl? Tatsuo! Happy birthday! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! That's super hot! It's not going to burn you calm down! It burned me! Are you for real? Thanks everyone! Hurry up and blow out the candle! Knock it off! If you can get into the medical field that would be awesome! I would have to learn all that stuff first before I can get in... However! If you want to pass the medical exam, you have to work really hard! It must be pretty rough for you huh? Why do you say that? Shut up bro! This drink is for you. You are the hero tonight! Alright everyone! Let's open them together! Happy birthday! Since we're all here... do you guys want to listen to Tatsuo's and Kana's song? I want to hear it! I've never heard it before! It's because this guy is only focused on studying! I was just playing the guitar! It's been a while, show us a song! But we disbanded! We didn't disband! We wanna hear it! Kana, how about you sing? Are you for real? I'm looking forward to it! I'll definitely pass the exam. So wait for me in Tokyo. I know that! Hurry up and play! Shut up guys! Kana! It's almost time. Good work! Here! Take care of this too please! Oh thank you! You're a lifesaver! I'm still pretty nervous... I saw a ton of guests outside. For real? Is Kana really that popular? It's because she worked so hard this year. We came out to Tokyo and went to the 8th right? Where is the 8th? It's over there! That's the Tokyo Tower isn't it? You're not good enough for the general exam! You said it! Disneyland is supposed to be in Tokyo right? Disneyland is in Chiba! Where is Disneyland? It's in Chiba! It doesn't matter where it is! Long time no see! Kiri? No way... She's cute! Kiri... your look has totally changed. You're more girly now. Really? You really changed. Were you waiting for us this whole time? I wasn't waiting for you! Let's go! Let's go! Hey let's hurry up! You shouldn't be interested in all of this political stuff! What if I said I'm a candidate? Yeah right! Let's go! Here we are! Awesome! Hold on! It's dangerous! What's up with this place? Hold on! Hold on! It's already started! Hurry up! Hurry up! Tatsuo! Why are you spacing out? You like Kana don't you? That's not it! That's not it! That's totally it! Sorry for taking so long! Good work! I was so happy Kana! Thanks! I actually started crying! Did you really cry? I did! I did! You actually cried? What are you going to drink Kana? Tea! No, no... drink up! Kana has stopped drinking to help her singing! For real? You aren't even a professional! Shut up! She's going to become one. She's definitely going to go pro! What's up with you? I'm just stating the obvious! Yo! Yo! You were so cool. I know! But you know what? I was actually touched by your performance surprisingly. Even a lame-ass girl like her can do such a good live in Tokyo! Wow! You piss me off! That's enough. You really are something else! Here it comes! Here it comes! Kana has something to say! Thank you for coming everyone! I'm glad that everyone got to see me. I'll definitely light this place up! Cheers! Hold on! What the hell man? There is something else that needs to be announced. It's big. Hold on... What is it? Well... you know... We both have decided to get married. For real? Really? Also... There's more? I'm going to become a mother! No way! I've always been bad at singing... But you're good Tatsuo. As a backup singer. I had so much fun then. I was burnt by the fireworks though... Is that so? Here! Happy birthday. You remembered? Of course I did! It's a success charm. Thanks. If I were a genius, I'd be in Tokyo right now. You are a genius Tatsuo. I really like the songs you compose. I know! I still have a composition. I'll give it to you next time. This brings back the memories... Kana! Kiri! It's hot isn't it? Oh no! I'm so sorry I was late! It's hot isn't it? Here you go! Thank you! Here! Thank you! Kana-san? Yes! Nice to meet you. I'm Tachibana. Please take care of me! I'm Kawashima Kiri! Please take care of me! Go ahead! I heard your song! It was wonderful! Did you do it all yourself? No, I did it together with my hometown childhood friend. It's kinda like... Your singing is very outstanding. However, if you want to be famous throughout the country... You need to start anew. Okay... So..I know this is soon but... Do you have any other special skills besides singing? Any skills? Yeah. Singing skills alone won't get you anywhere. You need to be multi-talented. If you only have one ability you won't be able to succeed. The people who get famous are like this. Then... what does your friend think? There's that! Umm... during her school festival... She wore a costume and sang. She was very popular! That's just for musicals! Hold on a second... what the heck? That sounds funny. She wore a costume? She was super cute in it! Hey Kiri! You can't! But you were really cute... You can't! But you were really cute... That could work... You guys might have a chance! A costume huh? What does he mean? Will China extend the time limit? This is what happens with China. Japan has to complain. China is pretty bad... What's wrong? Do you think that China is good? Kana is way more interesting than China! Check it out! Check it out! Are you for real? Hello? Hey Tatsuo! Kana left you behind man! We have an emergency meeting! Come to the bar. I'm taking a test right now... We're all 20 years old now. How long are you going to study for? Sometimes you gotta go all out! I will call you again. Sorry! Hey Tatsuo! He's no good. Kota! Let's go to the bar together! Ah sorry! I'm going out to drink with the boss! He said he can make me a full-time employee. Are you going to come too? No, no, no... There's no way I'm gonna go. But like... are you going to be working full-time here? We're 20 years old! We have to protect our family. That's ice cold! What the hell is up with you? No, no, no... I'm talking about pension, taxes, and stuff like that. Adults have a lot to think about. I'm an idiot so I don't understand anything! Sorry but I'm leaving! We'll talk about it later! No we're not. Don't be a scared little baby! Don't laugh! Shit! But like... I really can't accept this! Well Kota is married. You should understand. I don't understand! But isn't working full-time hella lame? Aren't you already working full-time? You earn money in the factory every single day. I'm different. I'm going to do something big in the future. We said the exact same thing two years ago! Are you trying to start a fight bro? Hey Ryo! What kind of "Big" thing are you going to do? I don't know. That's why I'm searching for it! You just stay here and don't do anything. Your life will never change from now on. No, no... you guys are the ones not doing anything! Hey Ryo. Do you wanna take a leap of courage? In your factory... Isn't there a lot of copper wire? Let's earn a little money shall we? Help us get some cash. This is pretty bad Ryo. Hey, stop saying stupid stuff numb nuts! Alright! Take it back! I know! I know! You'll get your cut. This is bad Ryo... Let's stop this... Are you gonna be scared this easily? We've been cast aside. Cast aside? Kota and Mariko have their own world. And the remaining people have gone to Tokyo. What about us? We have nothing. We're gonna change the regime Tatsuo. Okay? Hey Ryo! Hurry up! Alright! Don't let them down. Let's hurry up! Shut up! No artificial carrots. No additives. Stop that! It's embarrassing! It's okay! It's a big leap! Here! What is that? A present! A present? Yeah! What's up with you all of the sudden? What is it? Hmm, I wonder? Hold on a second. It's a mug! It's a matching mug! It means that you need a dream in order to create a future. It's cheesy! But thanks! I really want to have a concert. But I don't want to sing about carrots, I want to sing my own songs. Kana... You have to endure it for right now. Tachibana-san told you right? I know that but... Is there any other way? A street performance! A street performance? That's right! That might work! I wonder? Yeah. Let's try it out! Alright! That sounds good! Excuse me. What? Ah, Kiri! Fans of Kana came to our store today. They saw the commercial! But she didn't answer her phone at all! Can you hand the phone over to Kana-chan? She's not here right now. Is that so? By the way, I heard that you dropped out of school. What are you going to do from now on? I'll be Kana's manager! Hey you can't bring Kana-chan down. What the heck? Hold on a second. Welcome! Okay! Okay, look this way! That's a good picture! Look over there. Look over here! Thank you. I'm home! Yuki! You haven't changed at all. Shut up! What happened to your hair? I cut it. You cut off a lot! It looks good on you but... Who are you? Don't ask that! I haven't changed at all! You've totally changed! What's his name? Kazuo. Kazuo? Kazuo-kun! Good afternoon! It's still really deserted. It's so peaceful... You're looking down on the place you were born huh? Sorry! Sorry! But were you guys okay after that earthquake? There's no way we were okay. Were there power outages and stuff like that? There were a lot. For real? It was pitch black in the night time. That's the way it always is right? That's the way it always is... Shut up bro! No, no.. So what's up with you? Well... I feel like Japan is experiencing a difficult period. But why am I the only one who is looking for a job? I felt like something was off and so I came back. You quit university? No I didn't! I'm on summer break right now. You're on summer break? That's right! That brings back the memories. We graduated from high school 3 years ago huh? 3 years huh? Is everyone doing okay? Everyone? I mean..Tatsuo. He won't answer the phone when I call him! Did I say something bad? No, no, no... Don't say that! Everyone has noticed by now huh? Kanako sure is popular! That's a given! She's a very big woman figure after the national women's soccer team! She is! Right? That should make you very happy huh? You're glad right? What do you think? Nothing. ♫She said Mu♫ She's Mutenka! ♫Mutenka means additive free♫ She's good! Can't she sing anything other than carrot stuff? She has singing power. If you can sing and look good then you can debut right away. What? You... It's just Yuki... Long time no see! You scared me... Sorry! Are you catching a cold Tatsuo? I'm okay now. It's nothing! Is that right? Hey Tatsuo. They told me. They said that you quit taking the exams. That would tire you out huh? I really wanna stop job hunting! Well, I decided to enjoy my free time before becoming a member of society. You can also say I liberated myself from depression. What the heck? You should have gone to Tokyo! Kana is waiting for you isn't she? I saw her before and it seems like a lot of stuff has happened. Recently she was asked to sing songs she doesn't like. Yeah.. Hey Tatsuo! If you don't go outside you're going to become a mole! It's okay. It's not okay! I will... I told you I'm okay! Sorry... I'm going... Okay... Later... Good work. Good work! When they compared you to the national women's soccer team and all you said was Mu? ♫Which can mean nothing♫ People got really mad. I'm sorry about that. This is a crucial time right now. They've already decided to sell No additive carrots Kanako DVDS as well as Kanako gymnastics DVDs. They're going to announce it tomorrow. Tachibana-san... I don't want to do gymnastics. Well... I understand your feelings but... Right now we need to get their attention. After that we can do what we want. But to be honest... I'm very anxious... That I'm going to stay this way... Oh, that's right! Kiri! The SG girls stuff has been officially fixed. From here on out we're going to be very busy! Can you work this out? Yes! Kana. Let's talk about this later. Right now you're going to become a big star in Japan! Hello? This is Tachibana. Good work. Yes! Yes! It's tomorrow right? Yes! Yes! Sorry.. Huh? You sure are cute! Are you a model? No... You're a model aren't you? I work in that field. Are you interested in it? You'll definitely get in! I saw it in one glance! Hey, hey.. Don't ignore me. Hear me out. I'll speak on the phone and get your debut as a model then you'll become big! Hey don't ignore me... Ah sorry for the wait! Do you need something from my girlfriend? I don't need anything. You stupid girl! If you're just spacing out then he's going to keep going after you. This is how Tokyo is like. Thank you! Are you taking pictures? Yes! What a coincidence. I am too! Let's exchange contact information. I look forward to our drive tomorrow. Hey don't look at it! What does he do? It seems like he's an art photographer. How nice! While I'm over here all lost you are falling in love. That's not it! But what you said today was a little too much. Hey! What's this SG girls thing? I heard that it was a newcomer idol group. Sorry... I was told to study a lot about this field. I want a live concert already! I want to sing my own songs! You'll be okay Kana! I promise you! I wonder? I've lost confidence... I hope Tatsuo comes here soon! Why? I can support you but... Tatsuo needs to do all the music related stuff. I wonder? I heard that he quit the exams. Is that right? He really doesn't have any guts. I'll create the best songs by myself. Pardon me! What's wrong? Does this look familiar to you? It does! It's the copper wire we always use. Two copper wire incidents occurred last month. It was done by avoiding the night guards. I know about that. But did something else happen? Ryo. You seem to be doing pretty good financially recently. I heard that you've been going out to mess around every night. No way! Do you suspect me? This is shocking to me! It wasn't me! I understand. I'm sorry for suspecting you. Hang in there okay? Yes! Good work! What is it? Hey Ryo... We aren't kids anymore. What do you mean we? Don't get the wrong idea. I'm different than you guys! What the hell? Is it just me? Okay! Happy birthday! But like I said..hurry up! We're waiting for you! I already bought the beer. Yeah! Okay, okay! Where are you going? The convenience store. No, go back to your room! Clean up a little bit in here! What the hell is this? This isn't a living space for a human! Stop it! I said stop it! What the hell is this? It has nothing to do with you! Let go! Let go! It's because of this worthless junk! You're 21 and you're not studying! What are you doing!? It would be better if I didn't exist wouldn't it!? Hey Dear! Never say something worthless like that again! I'm thinking about you. Are you okay? Get out!!! She wears it on her head like this. Is she that carrot girl? Yes! That's right! She's the one that's getting popular now? That's right! So that girl in the ad was your classmate huh? That's right. Her name is Kana. She's my best friend. I'm her manager right now. You're chasing your dreams with your best friend huh? Sounds like fun. It's fun! But lately... I wonder if that's the case? I understand what you want to say Kiri-chan. You feel the gap between your dreams and reality right? Yes! That happens to me as well. For people who create things, this is a necessary stage. That is true.. Don't worry and take your time. You'll definitely get rewarded! Thank you! You think a lot about your friends. Well... I've always been alone. I wasn't really loved by my family... This may sound exaggerated but... After I met my friends... My world has taken a 180 degree change. I feel so good to be alive... I've been talking too much..I'm sorry! The face you just made was great. What was that just now? Please don't tease me! I'm not teasing you. You are teasing me! Sorry... What's wrong? If you do this then you're going to end up hating me Seiji-san. Why's that? Right after I was born I had a big surgery. When I look at it, I hate myself more and more. Seiji-san? You've done your best alone haven't you? Kiri... It's okay. It's okay. You need to control your alcohol intake a little more. I know that! But I end up drinking more! Is it because Kiri-chan went to Tokyo? No way! How is Tatsuo-kun? Is he working hard on his exams? It's embarrassing to say but he hasn't gone to cram school recently. Sometimes I hear him playing his guitar in his room. I wonder if I've spoiled him too much... If that's the case then our Kiri has been spoiled her whole life. It's just... I'm always worrying about his future. Well..him being happy is the most important thing right? If we think about the future nothing will start up. And nobody knows what will happen! That is true... I will pay the rent like I normally do. I'm really sorry about doing this so suddenly. It's okay! I still have a job that makes me money even if I don't really like it. Kana... Don't make it so sad! Seiji-san! I'll leave Kiri to you. Please leave it to me! I'll take that. Thanks. Later! See you later! Later! Sign right here. Ryo. Things aren't easy like that. Thanks for taking care of me. You sure are an idiot too huh? It's smarter to earn some more money than work your ass off. I feel relieved that I got fired. But like... don't get Tatsuo involved! It has nothing to do with you. We aren't kids anymore Ryo... I didn't expect that there would be a day where I get lectures from you. Piss off! Hey Ryo! Where are you going? Shut up! It doesn't have anything to do with you! No, it's impossible. No, like I said... It will be just for one day. No well... I think that will be pretty tough. Our dormitory is very strict about people staying overnight. Ah whatever... I won't be seeing you anytime soon. Wait..why? Hello? Young man, smoking is prohibited there. Don't say "Huh?". You are prohibited from smoking there. Is that so? I remember all the nasty things you said about Tokyo. Shut up and hurry up. Shut up! Okay. It's all good. Don't give me that! Geez... But like... I heard that the Sky Tree is pretty crazy right now. Can you see it from here? You can't see it. How about you look at the Tokyo Tower? The Tokyo Tower huh? It's huge! I think that the Tokyo tower is better than the Sky Tree. The red color is nice. Doesn't it look like me? It's a passionate red. I don't understand at all. By the way... I see your songs on the late night shows all the time. That's the no additive carrot songs right? They're not mine. What's up with that logic? Isn't it strange? Are you a duo or something? Shut up, geez... Perfect timing. I wrote a new song. I want you to hear it. For real? With this composition, I can say farewell to Kanako. U-Umm... This is... T-Tachibana-san... This is a demo for Kana's new composition. Hey Kiri... How long have you been here? 3 years... Yet you still don't understand at all. We create value. Turning value into profit is no joke. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes... You need to understand these rules better. Tomorrow you're going to be in charge of the SG girls. Do you guys think that you are artists? You guys may think that. It's all thanks to me! You should be grateful for me! I saw your talent during Karaoke. Dummy! It was Tatsuo! Tatsuo loved my singing and he helped teach me how to compose songs. He went to concerts with me and we graduated high school together. After that... Tokyo! What the hell? Tatsuo is going to get all the credit? He can do it. Is Tatsuo doing okay? Yeah. He's doing fine. I found something good! You can't! You can't! Hold on! But to be honest this is amazing. Hurry up and sing that song for everyone. This carrot bastard is good too though. Carrot bastard? I don't need your help. If only you could buy a live house for me. I could sing everyday. You don't need to dream about that, just do it. Don't say those things when you're jobless. You don't understand do you? When we are unemployed, all we have is hope. We're free! Free huh? That's right. Free. You haven't changed at all Ryo. Alright, time to sleep. Hold on, hold on! I'm still drinking... I have rehearsals tomorrow! I'll sleep with you. I'm here and all. Die! Hey... Turn off the lights. Where is it? Over there! What a pain in the ass! Carrot bastard. Damn carrot! What do they mean no additives? Ryo! Hey Ryo! Senpai! Long time no see! You've really changed senpai. You haven't changed at all. But I heard that you got mixed up in some trouble with Takahashi. You got that info quick! I don't know what I was thinking... You stayed in the same hometown as me... It's only natural you would get into trouble. We don't worry about the past in here. I don't have a lot of love for that place. Well..the work here isn't very strict. Feel free to let loose! Okay! I'm home. Welcome home. You're here early. Hey Seiji... It's nothing... What? Go ahead and say it. You have my interest. Seiji. Did you transfer money from my account? I did. But it's not your account... it's our account right? Ready... start! Let's start. - No additive carrots - This person won't last much longer. She's just a fad. - I'm tired of seeing her. - She's an artist who can't write. - They're forcing it. - Let's see how long she will last. What? Why did you suddenly video call me? It's good to see your face every now and then. At least for today. What happened today? It's my birthday today! Congratulations... now what? Well..I just feel like this world is developing so fast. I heard your song. It was really good! Now you tell me? You're late! I tried to make an arrangement that would fit your song! - It's even cooler than "The Blue hearts!" - Translator note: The blue hearts were a Japanese punk rock band formed in 1985. I'm going to send it to you. Give it a listen! No way. Besides don't just do whatever you feel like. Well..I just thought that you might want to sing your own songs.. How can your song work? It's not a sweet little world like that. I'm different than you. I've always wanted to sing, I'm not just messing around! Sorry... During our last summer vacation in high school... I had so much fun singing together with everyone during the fireworks. I thought that we could go back to those days. Kanako. It's time! Okay! Tatsuo. We can't go back. Things have changed after all. Let's stop talking about the past okay? Do your best. Please! Alright! Let's get ready to start! Please! Good work! Ryo. This is what you're doing today. Okay! You can pay the 530,000 yen right Grandpa? Hello Grandma? It's me. Do you recognize me? Yeah, that's right. Hey Grandma... I got into a little bit of trouble... I got into an accident with my senpai's car. The repairs need quite a bit of money... I'm here! Have a seat. (Alright!) Is this much okay? You have talent, no doubt about it! You'll get this month's turnover no problem! Thanks! Chiraki-san. I have a goal. What is it? I want to open a live house. Sounds nice. I'm cheering for you. Thanks! Hey, come on! Seiji! Can you please stop doing this? I don't want to do this but this isn't right! Come on, get up! What do you mean? Come on..this isn't right! Why did you change the passbook without telling me? Isn't that weird? You not telling me isn't right! You just spend all the money don't you? Unacceptable.. It's because I love you. Let's not hide things. Okay Kiri? Okay... We'll always be friends. From Tatsuo. Tatsuo! This is impossible. I can't stand this. We're just sitting here and not talking. What time is it? Let's drink. You're sure drinking a lot huh? Stop pretending to be serious man. Come on! Here! Drink up! Nope. Kana! You don't have to force everyone to drink! They haven't found it yet. His last words. Of course not. What do you think is the cause of death? I don't know. He just died out of nowhere. Really? I don't really know what happened but there's no way he would kill himself. Huh? Are you Tatsuo? I'm not! But it's obvious isn't it? Hey, let's stop this! But the last time that I saw him... He looked very worn out. He told me stuff I didn't understand. Huh? Are you saying it's my fault? But isn't it true that you asked him to do some sketchy stuff? There's no way he would die from that! (Stop it!) I can't stand this. That's enough. What the hell man? Actually... I'm going to say that to all of you! You guys are all thinking about Tatsuo now... But you guys didn't care about him at all. You guys didn't even remember his birthday did you? Kana... Weren't you super close to him before? But after you got famous, you totally ditched him didn't you? Why did you come to this funeral? What do we even understand about Tatsuo? You guys don't know anything about him! What are you saying about us? Hey stop it... Stop it!! Stop it! I'm begging you. Please leave. Kana? Kana! They sure did get into a shameful fight. Things like "Who messed up" and "Whose fault is it?" Shut up! Would this happen if you guys didn't go to Tokyo? What do you understand? This is obviously the last time we'll be able to mourn for Tatsu0-kun... We're against restarting the power plant! The prime minister's next nuclear leak can be in 100 years or next year Do not use power plants to promote the economy. It's hot! What the hell just happened? If you don't know then just confirm it! People like you are paid fairly well. I'm sorry... You have to make 5 times more than what your salary is. If you make double your salary it won't work out. Today you're going to go to the sushi restaurant to start up the deal. I'm sorry... can you please let me off? Don't give me that! Is "Blah blah blah" the only thing you can say, stupid? Hey... hey! What are you doing? (I'm sorry!) No additive Kanako had a high school band. She betrayed her band member by debuting. Her original band member committed suicide. Kanako is a murderer. Kana-chan drank a lot! Is she okay? I'll go and see. Hey, hey, hey! What the heck? It's you Ryo? Let's drink up! Here! Drink up! What the hell is that? XYZ - What is that? - What? You don't know? It's the most powerful sake! It means that there's no going back. It's perfect for me. Kana. It's been a year. It's already been a year! Get back on your feet already! (Look!) Today is July 8th! It's Tatsuo's birthday! Let's record a video! Tatsuo! Happy 23rd birth... Hey stop this Kana! It wasn't your fault right? Then why did he die? Why did Tatsuo die!? Who knows! But right now I'm talking about... Hey Ryo... are you trying to preach to me? Never talk to me again in this lifetime! I can do it. Really? Then put the heavy one in first. The potatoes! No additive Kanako drunk Wonderful moments of violence against regular men Kanako. I can't protect you anymore. But like..My name is Kana. I took all that time training you... You were training me to be Kanako huh? I know that you are going through a lot because of your friend but... Let's talk about that on TV. Wouldn't that make things easier? Hello? I'm coming back today. Really? Yeah. Can you wait until I come to eat? Today is our two year anniversary after all. You remembered? Of course. I'll see you later. Yeah. See you later. The goal. Start our career! Sorry! I had a work call. Recently, things have been going pretty well at work. When things become stable, we have to prepare for the wedding. That's true. Hey Maki... There's something I want to discuss with you. I want to hold a large solo exhibition next month. It's pretty pricey huh? You're the only one I can rely on. You're going to run away aren't you? No way..There's no way I'm going to run away. Hold on a second... what the hell is this? Yamamoto Osamu-san. We have an arrest warrant for you. Do you know these men? You're not Seiji-kun are you? The whole photographer thing is a lie too right? It was true at the beginning. Alright Hello? Yes, that is me. Rumors about no additive Kanako. The consequences of pushing a friend to suicide. Come in! It's Kiri! Have you been drinking? Not at all! Long time no see! Let's drink! Kana... Seiji was arrested. It was marriage fraud. His real name was Yamamoto Osamu. It's funny huh? What the hell? That's super funny! That's the first time I've heard about marriage fraud. Is it really that funny? Don't get mad... Hey Kana... You're not going to play music anymore? It has nothing to do with you. It does! Every since I met you, I have changed. That's why I want to be by your side and support you. I'm tired of hearing that. You know what Kiri? You're always telling me about yourself. Are you a narcissist? That's not it. Why? I've watched you succeed.. And I heard your song on TV.. Do you know how happy I was when I saw that? It's not even my own song. Kana... Besides... It was all your fault. Kana? You know what Kiri? People online are saying that I killed Tatsuo. It makes you feel relieved doesn't it? What are you saying? You talk about the past more than anyone. And then you go around trying to promote me in commercials and stuff. That's why things are like this. Didn't you say it before? That you'd be cheering me on? I believed in you. You promised me that I would be okay! That made me so happy... But... I was all alone before I realized it. I wonder why? Kana.. When you think about it... I should have never met you. I would probably be making music with Tatsuo now. Before he died... Was he living a happy life? When you're around... Everyone falls into misfortune. Tell me that was a lie... Leave. Alright! Let's do some more! Okay, let's raise hands! 1, 2, 3! Oh, that's too bad! Let's go! Kiri? Kiri! Sup! What's wrong? Kiri? Hey Kiri! This fruit grows super fast! - Right? - You're right. It's getting bigger. - Having fun? - Awesome.. SG girls National Tour Kiri-chan? Kiri? Huh? Did your dreams get shattered? Kiri..can you get me some cold water? This hangover is awful... I'll get it for you! Sorry about that... Sup! Long time no see! Alright... good work! Yeah! Hey... do you remember this place? Doesn't it bring back the memories? It's been five years since we've graduated high school. Time goes by fast! Did you come here to talk about that? Hurry up and spit it out. Sorry... Well... Right now I'm selling insurance.. And so... Right now.. Do you have insurance right now? This is pretty tough... - Umm... - It's fine. I don't know about the examination though. For real? It's fine! I won't understand even if you tell me. Just write it normally. You're a lifesaver man... Sorry... Don't apologize. Is that the way you speak or something? Yeah.. Tatsuo... It's been 2 years huh? Right now... I feel like I'm starting to understand how he felt. Are you being serious right now? How can you understand the feelings of someone who tried to run away? You don't have to speak like that... You're living a life full of ignorance every day! You wouldn't understand these kinds of feelings. I don't want to understand! No matter how pretty you make it sound... When you die it's all over. I've thought about it a lot too! But... We have no choice but to live right? I'm going. I want this too! We don't need that! (We have that at the house.) We have it at the house. Put it back. Kiri? No way... what a suprise! Long time no see. Long time no see. What are you doing? W-working? I'm working here. Alright! Alright! Time to sleep huh? Hey hold on! Little brat! It's time to sleep! Which one is the son? But Kouta is a proper father huh? He's saying that he wants to buy another house for us. Really? Right Kouta? You want another house right? Yep! Yep! My goal is to be the best Dad ever! Okay! Okay! Kiri... You can tell us anything just like back in the day. You can stay over as much as you want. Thanks. Alright..let's sleep. Okay! Good night! Good night! Time to sleep! So fast! You're the one who doesn't want to sleep the most! Alright, good night! Kana-chan. This can make you forget about everything. I have no money. It's going to be free of course. Hey! Get it together! I'm tired... You're so persistent you dumb-ass! Go away! You have nothing to do with me right? Then why are you drinking at a store where I work? Who's going to be happy seeing you like that? Would Tatsuo be happy? Don't act spoiled and depressed! You know what? I can't sing anymore... My throat was destroyed by alcohol. This is retribution. Serves me right! Do you see that I'm just an alcoholic? Why did it turn out like this? It shouldn't be like this... It shouldn't be like this... Later! It's time to have some fun! Thanks a lot! Kazuo! Take care of your big sister okay? Alright! Alright! We're going! (See you later!) We're going! (Be safe!) Bye! Alright... where should we go? To the park! Alright! Let's go to the park! Let's get ready. Kiri-chan! Kazuo-kun? Kazuo-kun? Kazuo-kun? Are you okay? Are you okay? Kazuo-kun! Kazuo-kun! Kazuo-kun! What am I going to do? Kazuo-kun are you okay? Excuse me! Please! What happened? He has a bad fever! Over here! As long as he stays resting, he should be okay. It's my fault... He's fine don't beat yourself up about it. That's not it... When I'm around... Everyone falls into misfortune. It would be better if I weren't around. Kiri-chan... I'm sorry! You were brought in here like this a long time ago. Your Mom was crying and saying "Please! Please!" She never told me that... When she is faced with important things she will say dumb stuff. She's still paying for your surgery. Kiri! Thanks! I'm sorry but we are closed... You never told me. About what? The surgery money. Why didn't you tell me? I don't want to make you feel like you owe me. I hate that. I'm lame.. I still ended up running back to my hometown and relying on you. That's lame... Isn't it okay to be lame? I'm lame too! I don't want to be like that! It can't be helped. We're mother and daughter after all. Hey Kiri... I don't think that there is a right answer in life. Maybe you might have a failed life. But that's how it will be. Isn't that fine? Tell it to me straight. I don't understand. It's embarrassing! A mother and daughter on the night road. What the heck? You worked hard in Tokyo for 5 years didn't you? It's your life after all! Be more confident! Perfect LiveSG girls How can our life be a failure? We don't have to be perfect in life and have everything... Welcome! Thanks. Pardon the intrusion! What are you doing!? What do you mean? Don't play dumb! That song is the first song written by me and Tatsuo! I'm sorry. We receive a lot of CD samples everyday. I don't understand. Do you know how I feel? Do you know what the state of my mind is right now? I'm sorry. I don't really understand idealism. We are professionals. Please go back. Go ahead. It's in the same condition. This... He bought that on the day of his death. Give to Kana. Ao no Kaerimichi To Kana. We will still be Friends. Please answer the phone Kana... Morning. Why? Anyone who got that kind of text would be worried. But like... So much blood will come out when you cut your wrist. I was suprised. That being said... My blood is flowing in your body right now. They found the bus ticket in Tatsuo's room. Kiri found it in Tatsuo's room. And also... this. This is Tatsuo. Kana? This may be bothersome but... I still tried making the composition. It's depressing as always though... I want to see you singing this song. If possible I want to be next to you. I may be stupid but I can still sing. Even if I'm a genius... I just have to write one hit song. I'll get enough money to die happy. Then I can enjoy life until I die. Even if I'm a king... I'll have all the people I hate disappear. Maybe everyone but me will disappear. In that case it would be better if I disappeared first. I want to see your sleeping face... Even with the way that I am... I don't think it's all bad. Seeking something that doesn't exist and making endless jokes... Even if I'm smart.. I will go to the university to study hard. Even if I find a good job and honor my parents... I really want to see their happy faces. I'm going! Hey... Did you forget anything? Nope! Okay! Did you take your eye drops? Bring it. Be safe out there okay? See you later! See you later! There it is! There it is! Hello? Hello? Okay! Alright, I'll go pick you up then. Where are you right now? Huh? Don't bullshit me! Hey Yuki... I'm not going to get insurance with no contract. You've already been released haven't you? Why? I'm in a rush to pick you up! Hello? It's hot huh? It is! Nothing has changed here huh? Long time no see! Are you doing well? (Yes I am!) Man what a suprise! What's up with your style? You look like you're from Tokyo! We're free! I saw the ocean! (It's a river!) It's the ocean! Alright! Let's do some fireworks today! Sounds good! It's Tatsuo's birthday after all! Brings back memories! You can't be acting like that anymore. We're adults after all. Dumbass! You're acting all high and mighty! Stop that!
