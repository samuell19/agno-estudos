Good day. - Where's the boss? - Over there. Call him. - Sir, someone wants to see you. - Okay. - Hello, sir. - Hello. What is it? As per your orders, I've been following him from jail. - He has come here. - So my guess was right. Where's he now? He got off the bus and went to the bazaar, and I came here. Look, ask Chandar and Bahadur to keep a watch on him... and inform me of everything they learn about him. Got it? I'll be home in the evening. It's this tree! It is! Hey! who are you? What are you looking at? Nothing. I was watching your swing. What's different about it? Seeing it, I was reminded of my childhood. - Really? - Yes. Sister has come! - Yes sister? - Who are you talking to? With him. Who are you? What are you doing here? - Who did you ask to come in? - So many questions in one go? Just answer what is asked. Who did you ask to come in? I've come here on my own. Indeed! How could you dare to enter a stranger's house? Why stranger? I consider everyone dear to me. What! Consider everyone dear? Why have you come? Answer that. - I came to see this tree. - Tree? I have old ties with this tree. A strange deep, emotional relationship. - What? - Whether you believe it or not... to see this tree, I have traveled for two days. You're good with words. What's your name? - Ranjit. - Where have you come from? - Bombay. - Bombay? Then go back there and trap some girl. - Meaning? - Your charm won't work here. - Go your way! - But listen to... - I know everything. Leave! Out! - Listen... Out! Crook! Bahadur, Chandar, come here! - What is it? - Ramavatar said Ranjit has come here. I always knew he'd return here. He got off the bus and went towards the colony. You two follow him. Don't let him out of your sight. Don't worry, we'll handle it. - Hello Mr. Dukhiya. - Hello. - Hello madam. - Hello. Two cups tea, puri bhaji, and hot fritters. The wrestler is with me. Right? - Right. - Sit there. - What would you like, sir? - A cup of tea. - My name is Bahadur Singh. - And I'm his friend, Chandar. We had important work with you. Have tea. When I speak to you, you won't take long is recognizing me. Tell him, sir. We're old friends. - We are Robert's partners. - Partners or murderers? It's the same thing. At least you recognized us. If you don't return Robert's gold to us, you'll meet the same fate, too. What you can do, even I can do. - What? - You don't understand. He means to say, all thieves are brothers. Come on, tell us, even you'll get a share. - Right, Bahadur? - Of course. Why fight? What fight, Mr. Coward? - Shut up! - Hey, Bahudur Singh! You can't break the cup. So what have you decided? Where did you hide the gold? I threw it in the river. Good. The police must have arrived. But you can't fool us. You're right. Mister, your name is Chandar, and you laugh like a monkey. - What did you say! - You think you're so smart? But we're one up on you. You can't cheat us. We have an eye on you. Be careful, you may go blind in that eye. You bloody rogue! Wonder where they come from? - What happened, Hansa? - He came to bother me early this morning. Aunt, who was that man? Don't know, he's new. He was good. Munnu, tell me, what story did I tell you yesterday? - Shall I say? - You keep quiet. The one I asked will tell. Tell me, Munnu. - Of King Harishchandra. - Good. Sit down. Gulab, what lesson do we learn from King Harishchandra's story? That however much sorrow we have, we must not get scared. - We must be brave. - Good. Sit down. So children, whatever problems we are faced with... we must not turn away from the truth. Brought the baby? Give me. Come, my baby! Go to sleep, child. You're crying today, you laugh tomorrow. Your parents are making your future. Don't cry. Maid, take care of the baby. You're still standing here? Go to work. Go. My baby is alone. Will the baby have any problem? Don't worry. So many mothers like you... leave their babies here in the morning and go to work on the dam. I take care of all of them. Your baby won't have any problem here. Go. - Who is this Baba (man)? - Laxmandasji, our savior. He has made many sacrifices for the country. - Really? - His leg broke from a police beating. He takes care of the laborers children now. He really is a good man. Bhola, why is there mud on this stone? - Sorry, sir. - Get every stone cleaned and taken up. Yes, sir. - How's your hand? - Better now. Bhola, how many workers are working on this side? 2000... sorry, 1000 this side, and 1000 on the other. - What about the mortar? - The trolley is coming. From tomorrow, work will begin on slope 11. Inform the contractor. Sorry, sir. What happened? Why're you shouting? Can't you see I'm going to work? I know you're going to work. But baby, how can I not call you... - when I see you? - Oh, so that's the case? Munia, last night I dreamt I've got married. Good! At least I escaped. - Listen Munia. - What is it? - What's going on here? - Nothing, sir. Sir... Munia, I know that Sukhan is a loafer. Gauri, if anyone troubles you, tell me. I'll dismiss him! You can dismiss him later. I'll teach him a lesson before that. You're right. Listen, why don't you take some rest? - Why? - You're perspiring in the sun. - Seeing you work hard, I feel bad. - What do you mean? If you understand, it's meaningful, or it's meaningless. Then consider it meaningless, Supervisor. What are you looking at? You do your work. - What is it? - Wait! - What is it? - You're very lucky. Why? That's why everyone shows you sympathy. I don't want anyone's sympathy. - Really? - Talk about yourself. That poor Sukhan dies over you. If he is born, he's going to die. Let him die, I don't care. What is it? Why are you after me? - How cruel you are! - I'm like you. - Who is he? - How should I know? Sorry, but who are you? Sorry, but who are you? You imitate me and ask me who I am? - I'm Bholanath. - You are very naive. I'm the contractor's supervisor. Without my permission, nothing happens here. - I can see that. - What can you see? A known face. - Who? Gauri? - What? Sorry, but do you know her? Yes, ours is an old relationship. Oh God! What is this? Blood! Sorry Munia, but this happened because of you. What? Because of me? No Supervisor, it slipped from my hand. Munia isn't to blame. I got badly hurt. Where did you get hurt? Let me see. What will you see? I'll call the doctor. Forget the doctor. Get tincture of iodine for me. You're too old to cry over a minor injury. Leave my foot! Let me apply medicine. Then I'll leave it. Move aside! Sir, being the supervisor, you will touch her foot? Give, I'll apply it. - Gauri, does it hurt too much? - She'll be fine, you leave. - Why should I? - If you waste time here... the company will lose money. Who are you to tell me that? I know my job. I know very well, Supervisor. What are you all doing here? Get back to work! Yes. - Is it okay now? - What okay? - It all happened because of you. - Because of me? Of course. Why did you tell the supervisor ours is an old relationship? Why? Didn't we meet this morning? Meeting in the morning makes our relationship old? That happens sometimes, Gauri. Crook! Gauri, come here. Now I know, Gauri. You're very secretive - What? - Now don't pretend. I'm a girl, and so are you. I know when a girl says no. - I only met him today. - After how many days? - For the first time today. - Don't hide from me. - I understand very well. - Go! I won't talk to you. Yes, why talk to me? Go talk to him. Why do you worry? I'm there to talk to you. Coming. - Gauri, what happened to your foot? - Nothing, the pan fell on my foot. - Are you badly hurt? - No, it's a small graze. - Who bandaged your foot? - He did. Okay, there's no need to worry. Go and work. - You dressed her wound? - Yes. You're a good boy. You help people when in trouble. - I've never seen you here before. - I arrived only today. - My name is Ranjit. - Okay. Come. So many people are working under the scorching sun. They're toiling day and night. It really is hard work. That's what I'm saying. These thousands, millions of people working here... do so not just to make wages, but so they can fight drought. So that they can stop floods. These dams will bring us joys in the future. The dam is our guard, our protector, our God. - Does it hurt too much? - No, the bandage has come loose. Then get it tightened by the one who tied it for you. - Munia! Mind your tongue. - Okay! Hey! Speak of the devil! Who? The one you belong to, who belongs to you. Not me, now call him. - How many days have you worked here? - Many days now. Actually... Sir, I'm leaving, my babe has come. Bye! - What is it? - Where? I'm asking you. Why are you following me? - I was going to your house. - What for? - To ask how your foot is. - It's fine now. It'll be fine in 2-3 days. - Now what? - Is your father home? I don't know. - Your father is very nice. I mean... - I very well know what you mean. - But I'm not a loose character. - What are you saying! Just because you bandaged my foot, you're after me now. - Keep your bandage! - Why did you open the bandage? - You're back, Gauri. - Yes. - I've put the tea pot on the fire. - I'll make tea. Hello, Baba. Come, son. You've come at the right time. Gauri, bring two cups. Okay. - Gulab, mangoes. - Take them. - Kid! - Coming, sister. Come inside, son. Where all did you go? Nowhere. I just roamed the bazaar and came here. You must have found this jungle strange. It is, but a new world is coming up. It really is. And when it's ready, even our times will change. - Will you eat mango, sister? - Who gave you? - He did. - Crook! What did I do? Eat. You participated in the freedom struggle, didn't you? Yes, I forget my family and jumped in the freedom movement. At that time, Gandhiji's call was echoing all over India. Who could have sat at home? - Then what happened? - Your head. - What? - Eat your mango. - What would happen? I went to jail. - Jail? Yes. I spent 12 years in jail. - 12 years! - People were hanged, sentenced to life. 12 years is nothing. But despite having such feelings of sacrifice, we have a big weakness. - What? - You wouldn't understand. What? Nothing! Where are the tea leaves? We got freedom. But our internal fights made us slaves again. Think something, try to understand! Why fight over difference in religion, status, caste? This country is ours, we belong to this country. - We must live united. - You're right. It is time to rise now. To make a new India. Do something that will benefit everyone, make everyone progress. So that our children grow up and proudly tell the world... they are Indians! - Father, tea. - How long have you been standing here? I was lost in thought. That's nothing new. But why tell a man who won't understand? What! You say anything that comes to your mind. - Baba, I'm leaving. - Have tea before you go. - Not now. - What? You won't drink? Do our milk and tea leaves come for free? Why would he drink? You say such insulting things. - Apologize to him! - I'm sorry. - At least have it now. - Have it, son. Son, don't mind her words. I was in jail for 12 years. There was no one to take care of her. She was left uneducated. She acts like that, but she has a good heart. Yes. You really recognized her. - Why are you smiling to yourself? - Who says I'm smiling? Go and study. Son, do one thing. Find a job here and get to work. When two people get together, they become friends. When they become five, they form a committee. When there are more, they become a society... a village, make a country. - Drop after drop makes the sea. - Your talks are very interesting. Oh, come on! I say whatever comes to my mind. - I'll be going. - Bless you. Gauri, I'm leaving. I'm sorry for any mistakes. And if you don't like my talking to your father... That's between you and father. Who am I to interfere? Next time you make tea, don't forget to add sugar. What! There was no sugar in the tea? Better! Why are you smiling again, sister? Not your business. Go and study! Go! Hey! Listen. - The tea was sugarless? - Yes. Take, have jaggery instead. But Gauri, we have jaggery only when marriages are fixed. Naughty! With the meeting of our eyes We fell in love You are surprised, and so am I I tried hiding, I tried escaping it But what to do when my heart is out of control? Now the whole world knows, family and even strangers know The world will taunt, why fear? Whether you know or not, whether you believe or not I have never loved anyone other than you If I had not met you, how would my eyes glitter? You are the cure to my heartache, my love Youth is short-lived, like flowing river water Sacrifice your heart for love Don't suppress your feelings, you also lose something For the garland of fair arms around you - You dance really well, Hansabai. - Leave my hand! Hansabai, I want to marry you. Move aside! Hey, Bahadur Singh! Leave her hand! Force won't be tolerated here. It may be force for you, it is love for me. Right you are, friend. I said leave my hand! Leave! - You rascal! Leave me! - I won't. - Hey! Leave her. - I won't. I said let her go. - You rascal! - Ranjit! I'll deal with you. - Shall I come now? - You won't dare! Let's go. We'll deal with him tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'll deal with you tomorrow. You saved my hotel's prestige. Where do you live? I'm looking for a place. Then stay here. Lodging, boarding, Rs.2 per day. Suits me. Hansa, show him the room. Come. - No one ever took us to a room. - We aren't that lucky. Let's go. Come. Sit. I'll change my clothes. What's your name? - From where? - Bombay. Bombay? Why have you come so far? Why do you want to know so much about me? You saved me from disgrace. Won't I want to know you? I've come looking for work. - What is your name? - Hansa. Or Rini? I was Rini, I'm Hansa now. Time changes man. Now I sing and dance. I'm free, absolutely free. The knot is so tight, it doesn't open. Please open it. Thank you. - Liked my song and dance? - It was good. - Only good? - Very good. The moment I saw you, I felt you were someone dear to me. Someone known, someone close to the heart. - What happened? Sit down. - Is this my room? It's mine, but you can treat it as your own. Show me my room. Come. - Is this my room? - Yes. The idiot has come! He's always bothering me. Coming. What coming? Just come. - Go, he must be wanting something. - Know what he wants? I know. Sorry, but why has this man come here? To meet me. - He's an old acquaintance. - He's your acquaintance too? Yes. He needs a job. Fix him up somewhere. - I would, but there's no opening. - Then create one. I put the responsibility on you. You have to give him work. Got it? Yes, I get it. But why are you so concerned about him? Asking and telling spoils the fun of a certain thing, Mr. Bhola. Okay, I understand. Your wish is my command. I'll give him a job. You really are a naive man, Mr. Bhola. An interesting man. - Your man has come. - Who? Your acquaintance who is a stranger. Oh my! See how sweetly he looks at you? Shameless! Brazen! Ask him to leave. He's your acquaintance Why should I tell him? - Don't tell him! Go die! - Why should I die? May my enemies die. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking. - What? - What is to be looked at? You look at me, people look at you. Just think what people will say. What will they think? Forget about them. You tell me what you think. Me? I think you're a crook. - Really? Then the crook is leaving. - Leave! I don't care. You don't do any work, you just roam around all day. - Wastrel! - I should get a job. One who wants to work finds a job. Sorry, but why do you keep making the rounds of this place? I've come to see you. Have a cigarette. I don't want your cigarette! Go away! As you wish. If you're asking me to leave, I'm going. Indeed! He makes the rounds to flirt. And then he imitates me. How long will you roam around like hat? I'm not roaming, I'm misleading. People like you. - Big deal! - Is that so? I'll finish my job today and leave tomorrow. Get that? We'll deal with you tomorrow then. There's no one here right now. Now's the time to escape with the gold. Hardworking man rose! The destiny of earth shined Great! That dust we touch turns to gold - Hard work... - Is what it's all about - Hard work... - Is the real support - Hard work... - Is our slogan! The generous nature will give everything All mountains on the way will crumble, just sweat it out The fool lying under the tree shouts for mangoes But one who climbs the branch gets the mangoes What will anyone give, how long will he give? Why should we beg? Why not build our dreams with this dust? - Hello. - Hello. Tell me. - I want a job. - There is no job. I'm educated, a mechanic, and I can even operate a crane. Sorry, I can't do anything for you. Thousands of people are working here. Can't I get a job too? I'm really sorry. Find work elsewhere. Listen. Got a job? You won't get a job asking him. He'll give you a job. Gauri, look. Your acquaintance knows others too. Mr. Bhola, give him a job. Now that you insist, I'll have to give him a job. But he's an educated, fashionable man. He won't work as a laborer. Don't tease me, Supervisor. I'll do anything you say. You can give me the job of carrying stones. Sure. Ramavtar, from tomorrow, 250 laborers will work on block 11. - Note his work too. - Not work, name. Ranjit. So you will teach me now? - Happy now? - Thank you, Supervisor. I'm talking to Hansa, and you are answering me? Sorry. I'll come to work tomorrow morning. Bye! Baba! I got a job. Of carrying stones. Really? That's great. Stones are the real foundation. Come, son. Where are you going, Gulab? To Mangal's house to play hide and seek. So you are going to play. Where is your father? He's gone to meet someone. He'll return late. - And where's your sister? - She's cooking in the kitchen. You go and play. I've come to give you good news. I've got a job. Rs.75 a month. But I still haven't found a place to stay. I thought I'd tell Baba. But it doesn't seem right. Shall I pour? Put more? - Hey! You made it watery! - At least you spoke. As if you care for my words. Go talk to that dancer. - You're referring to Hansa? - Hansa or Hansi, I don't care. You're very angry. Why don't you understand? - I understand everything. - You don't understand anything. What don't I understand? Weren't you laughing and chatting with her? - Only for selfish reasons. - I know you're a very selfish man. You don't know anything at all. Come with me! - What are you doing? - Come! Let go! Gauri, I told you the first day... I have an old, very deep bond with this tree. Know why? There's gold hidden in here. - Gold? - Yes. Gold worth Rs. 150000. - What? - Gauri, I'm not as bad as you think. Though for a moment, I did slip. I never expected I'd have to fly like a straw in a storm one day. What do you mean? I don't understand anything. Then listen, Gauri. I don't want to hide anything from you. Five years ago, I used to operate cranes on the Bombay docks. Ships used to come and go. My job was to load and unload goods... from morning to night, with the help of a machine. Even life was moving like a machine. I was alone in the world. I had no parents or siblings. I just had a friend named Robert. Robert used to travel on the ship. When he came ashore, we used to meet like brothers. - You've returned after many days. - Yes, I went to Aden. I was there for a month. There was a girl in my lonely life, Sudha. I loved her a lot, but perhaps destiny did not agree. One day, when I went to meet her... Your marriage has been arranged? - What are you saying! - The truth. Right. I'm an ordinary crane driver, you're a rich girl. We're no match. Don't say that. I won't care for anything to get you. - When is the marriage? - Day after tomorrow. - Day after tomorrow? - Take me far away from here. Or else... But I don't have any money to take you away from here. - I have jewelry. - No Sudha, I can't do that. But don't worry, I'll arrange the money. I kept wondering where to get the money. I thought of Robert. - Robert, I need money. - What for? Don't ask me that. Just know that if I don't get the money, my life will be ruined. I understand! It's a matter of love. I'll give you money, but you must do a job for me. What job? You know brother, even I love someone. - Who? - Rini. She's a fairy! - Really? - Yes. She came here from Goa, and then left for her home in Hyderabad. She left her bag here. Will you take it to her? - Sure. - You help me, I'll help you. When I was leaving with the bag, I suddenly heard... - Where's the gold? - You won't get the gold. Robert, tell me where the gold is! And the whole truth was revealed. But I couldn't save Robert. I thought I'd inform the police, but the greed for gold is bad. I took the bag and ran, and kept running. But the arm of the law is long. I was arrested, and was sentenced to five years. And after serving the sentence and came here. If you had given the gold to the police, you wouldn't have been jailed. The promise given to my friend made me helpless. Nothing else? There was a little bit of greed too, for my own comfort. And now? Have you seen a river in spate, Gauri? Spate? Yes, so? A home that takes years of hard work to build... is destroyed in minutes in a spate. - You know that? - Yes. A spate came in my life too... and carried away the greed for gold with it. But Sudha's story isn't over. When I was released, I learned she was married. That story came to an end. - And now? - Now I love someone else. Because man cannot live without loving someone. - Who do you love now? - Shall I say it? No. Listen. Listen. I like you very much, Gauri. Playing along, things just happened I tried hard to stop, but... playing along, things just happened He told me... since our eyes met, he cannot sleep Counting the stars, I swear, the night just doesn't pass I stared at him and expressed shock He's been after me since our very first meeting I gave him a finger, he took my hand My heart started pounding He said something in my ear, and my heart skipped a beat But I kept it in check I pulled back my hands and said If you don't leave now, you'll go to jail Then the good man... begged at my feet And I felt pity on him I thought, why not let the clouds of love burst? He came, I fell silent, he fell silent - You? - I thought we better decide today. - Decide about what? - The gold. You have escaped enough. We won't spare you today. Tell me where the gold is, or I'll kill you! Blood has always been shed to get gold that's ill-gotten. Shut up! - What's going on? - You? Leave him! - You bully a decent man? - But... Don't you feel ashamed? Go away! Go away, or I'll call the police. Go! Thanks for the favor. Listen! - What's your name? - Ranjit. - You seem new here. - Yes. My name is Mohan Singh. I'm the contractor here. - What work do you do here? - I carry stones. - Carry stones? - Yes. But you look educated and sensible. If you want to quit carrying stones and want a promotion, come to me. I treat no job as mean. Thank you anyway. - You? - Your charm drew me here. A big contractor like you coming to a girl like me is not ordinary. I'm a businessman, Hansa. What something is worth, I know very well. You are very beautiful. I wonder why I didn't notice you before. Anyway, forget the personal talk. Let's get to work. - Work? - Your name is Rini? - Who told you? - You loved Robert? You...? Before dying, Robert gave gold for you to a man. - For me? - Yes. Gold worth Rs. 150000. Rs. 150000? Rubbish! - It's the truth. - Truth? Then where is that man? - Where is that gold? - Wait. If I hadn't told you this, would you come to know? And if I don't tell you anything more, will you know? To learn about it, you'll have to agree to one condition. Condition? Everyone has a condition here. - Whose conditions do I fulfill? - I'm only talking about business. But that gold is mine. The gold is yours, but the business is mine. Think it over. You will make 35-40 thousand rupees just like that. - I agree. - Good. That means, you will work for me, and I will work for you. - Who has the gold? - Ranjit. Why shout? You crashed into the wrong person. - I didn't see you, Munia. Sorry. - Why will you see me now? See him. Crash into him. - Naughty! - Who, me? Then who else? Me? Gauri, you're very naive. When a young girl turns and looks at a young guy... and feels shy, smiles, and crashes into others... know that she's gone for a toss. - Don't tease me. - You call the truth teasing? Hey, better work, or your wage will get deducted. She doesn't care. You have such big eyes, can't you see? I can see, but nothing except you. - Shut up! - Why get angry? - I'll fill it for you. - Don't bother. This attitude of yours makes me call you babe. Coming! What is it? Munia, did you bang into the right man? Gauri, beware! You bang into him, and get angry at me. - Great! - Don't tease me, Gauri! You call the truth teasing? Really, it'll be a great pair. - You and him, right? - No, you and him. Naughty! Why do you bang into Munia every time? I don't do it deliberately. If your eye sight is bad, buy glasses. What's the need for glasses? Those who want to see, can even close their eyes and see. Supervisor, I've fallen in love with Munia. Quiet! If you fall in love with any girl, I'll dismiss you! Get that? Dismiss me, indeed! Who is he to dismiss me? Even if you dismiss me from the world, I won't leave my Munia. I know why your bangles clink Even I know who secretly came to your house Under the shade of the tree, talking romantic He stole my naive heart I know why your earring is shaking Twisting my arm, encircling me in his arms He captured my heart I know where your bindiya fell Don't tell anyone and I won't either Okay, you belong to your beau, I'll belong to mine What can one do when the feet's... What can one do when the feet's anklets tinkle There's no need to worry. You're fine now, Mr. Mathur. - I'll take your leave. - Okay. Bhola, where's the man who saved me? - He's siting outside. - Who is he? Call him inside. Yes, sir. Sorry. Come inside, sir has called you. - Hello. - Hello. Come in, why are you standing there? Seema, he's the man who saved my life. - She's my wife. - Hello. I'll never forget this favor of yours for life. Don't say that and embarrass me. It's our duty to serve our employers. Sorry. - Madam, I gave him the job. - What do you do? - I carry stones. - Stones? But you are educated. I've completed my matriculation. I'm also a mechanic. I used to operate a crane earlier. Oh. I'm sorry that despite being so capable, you work as a laborer. I know no one can repay a favor. But yet, I'll do everything I can for your good. Bholanath, he'll drive the crane from tomorrow. Sure sir, how can I forget? I knew he was capable, he will progress. I'll go to the office right now and make the arrangements. - Hello, Mr. Mohan. - May I come in? Hello Mrs. Mathur. - Hello Mr. Mathur. How are you? - I'm fine now. Thank God for that. I really was scared. I came running here. - You simply took the trouble. - Come on, sir. It's no bother. This is a jungle, and then, we are away from home. The rule here is that you help me, and I help you. You're right. If it wasn't for him, I'd be dead today. - Oh, so you're here. Great! - I'll send tea for you. - Okay sir, I'll leave. - Have some tea first. No sir, thank you. I'll leave. Okay, but drive the crane from tomorrow. Yes, sir. - You gave him a promotion? - Yes. - But... - But what? You don't know he used to drive cranes on the Bombay docks. Heserved a sentence of five years for smuggling. - How do you know? - I had an export-import business there. I used to go to the docks for that sometimes. But there's no law that states a man not be given a chance to reform. Of course. You're right. We want a party today! Oh cream! See what gestures the spring, the sights are making Belong to someone, time favors you My eyes have yearned to tell you something for so long Look into my eyes. Time favors you I tried convincing my heart, but it did not relent Convince my heart. Time favors you This pain is strange I can't find the cure You cure the pain. Time favors you Open the door, Gauri. Why have you come here? Don't you feel ashamed? I'm not like Hansa! - You misunderstand me. - I understand you very well. At least don't fight with me today. I got a promotion today. It's a day to celebrate. Then go and celebrate. Sing and dance with your hand round her waist. - Drink liquor! - You think I drank liquor? Smell me. I'm not a drunkard, Gauri. Everyone is celebrating for you, and you're sitting here? - I'm not destined for happiness. - Why? Because she didn't relent? - Why do you want to know? - Okay. But why do you get angry? Shall I tell you something? You aren't happy here, nor am I. Let's run away from here. It's not my job to run away with a girl like you. I know. I'm a very bad girl. But who brought me to this state? If you had returned Robert's gold to me... - I don't have any gold. - That means you won't give me gold. What I don't have, why argue about it? Shut up! I know you took that gold. But remember, I won't spare you like that. I'll take revenge. I won't let you live in peace! Sukhalal, teach him all the work in connection with the crane. Okay, Supervisor. Come, Ranjit. Pull me up. I'll show you. This is the button. Press it. That's the lever, pull it. - And this is the starter. - You already know it. - This is what I did in Bombay. - Then I don't need to explain it to you. You do your work, I'm going. Sukhan, help me down. Thank you. You are great! Now you look down at the world from there... and we'll work down. What's the point? You are happier. Your heart is happier. - What happened to your heart? - A slap in the face, and a hurt heart. - Had a fight with Gauri? - I gave you all a treat yesterday. - She even thought I drank. - Oh damn! Sukhan, only you can bring about a compromise. And how is that? You don't have to say that. I can do it in a jiffy! Then go quickly. Go fast! What happened? Why are you shouting like crazy? Consider me crazy. Come here. - Send Gauri alone for awhile. - What! Yes, I have some important work with her If I cannot talk to her, I'll die. - What rubbish are you talking? - It's the truth. - Why don't you understand? - I understand. I didn't know you were so bad. You eye my friend? If Ranjit hears you, he'll kill you! I'm doing it for him. Listen. If that's the case, why didn't you tell me earlier? I was, but you don't listen. Okay, you don't have to yak. I have understood now. Send her soon. - What is it? - Come here. What happened? What's the matter? You look very sad today. - Of course not. - Have you fought with him? - With whom? - With Ranjit, who else? I'm not concerned with anyone. Don't talk like that with me. You don't care for love? And work is so important? Good you're rid of love. Come with me. - Where? - Just come. - Where have you brought me? - Just come. - Munia, where are you going? - Gauri, come here. - Why? I'm getting late to work. - Forget work, come here. - What happened? - Look... flowers have been offered at the crane. What's that to me?? Shall I put one flower in your hair? - But that's been offered for worship. - So what? You'll put it in your hair, not throw it away. You wear one for me, I'll wear one for you. I don't want it. I'll wear it for you. Oh my! O people, see this unique sight of the 20th century The moon of earth has set out to touch the moon of the sky This moon is not of Russia, not of Japan Neither is it of America, this moon is Indian! You have covered your fair face with a scarf Even the sighted yearned for the sight. I'm lucky to see it Enemies see and feel jealous, friends praise it Let's see who you favor, who becomes your groom It roams from beauty to love Your one smile is evening, and another is the dawn - You simply ran so much. - Leave me. You can leave my hand and go, but how will you leave my heart? - Don't talk too much, or else... - Or else what? You beat me yesterday. What's the matter after all? You still don't understand me? You ask me? Why not ask yourself? - But what have I done? - How naive you are. You got me on the crane and showed me to the world. You teased me, defamed me. Getting you on the crane defamed you? And when you marry me, what will happen then? Enough of being angry, Gauri. Talk romantic sometimes. Romantic indeed! Don't you dare talk to that Hansa! Talking won't make me fall in love with her. That fair girl decks herself up and tries to charm you. Whereas I'm an illiterate, village girl, a laborer. You can't compare a well to the holy Ganga. I don't know how I raised my hand on you yesterday. - I'm sorry. - It was my fault. Of course. You always make me angry. Gauri, the day after tomorrow is August 15th, our independence day. A minister will come here. There'll be celebrations. I know. Madhav is making arrangements for song and dance. - Munia will also dance. - Won't you? No. I don't know how to dance. See how lovely the lights look. Like flowers have bloomed. Know how this place will look after the dam is completed? - How? - You don't know? Come, I'll show you. Mr. Ramaya, switch on the machine and show us... how the water will flow. If it rains heavily, it will stop the water flow. And the dam doors will be opened when we need water. The water will go straight from the dam to the fields. Even far away fields will get water. A new world will be created here. Then I'll buy some land in this new world. - Why? - I'll do farming, make a small house. - Then? - My dream will come true. - Come. - What are you doing! - People will see. - Who will see? What food have you brought? Hey baby, come here! - Come. - Hey! the kids are here. - Where are you lost? - Nowhere. I was seeing a lovely dream. - Where do dreams come true? - Our dream surely will. - Don't see dreams. - What do I do? I've learned that after finding you. If I hadn't met you, I would be what I was. You have awakened a man's sleeping heart. What are you saying? I didn't understand a thing. Oh God! It's very late. Father will be worried. I'm leaving. - Shall I walk you home? - No. What's this? The stones are broken like this? - I'm surprised too. - We'll need tons of cement to put them in use. You're right. This is useless. Cancel this lot. This isn't done, sir. You always... Quiet! You people want money for nothing. - This is unfair! - Quiet! You want wages for nothing, but I don't want to go broke. Go away! Cheats! What do we do next? After they leave, get the stones loaded in trucks and send them. I never expected him to do anything so cheap. Okay Ranjit, you go. I'll meet the chief engineer... - and arrange everything. - Yes, sir. Injustice? What injustice? What rubbish are you talking? Ramlal, ask your men to start work. We won't start work, sir. We've been cheated. Our wages are deducted every week... on the pretext of the stones not being cut properly. Until our earlier pay is restored, we won't begin work. Ramlal, talk sensibly. - Don't threaten us, sir. - You mean you'll argue with me? You think I don't know? I know who's behind this. We aren't such fools to not understand the truth. I know the facts. I'm sure Ranjit has accepted bribes from some contractor... to incite you against me. Don't shift your sins to me, contractor. You want to defame me to win your way. Tell us, where did the stones broken yesterday go? - I don't know. - But I do. Your men, at your command, sold the stones at night. Shut up! If you talk any more, you've had it! We'll face what comes, but we'll not bow before a cheat like you. A cruel man always raises his hand first. You should know that the ease with which they break stones... they can even break the head of a cruel man like you with ease. - You'll have to apologize. - Never! - You'll have to apologize! - So you're threatening me? No threat, we want everything to be decided with honesty. You'll have to apologize! Wait! What's going on? On the one hand, we're preparing to celebrate independence day... and on the other, you're bent on creating chaos? Good you came, Mr. Mathur. Ranjit is the cause of this riot. He encouraged these people and they've stopped work. The one to whom you gave work, gave a promotion... he's not only defaming your name, but also your work. Mr. Mathur, you don't know, but he... I know very well what Ranjit is. I also know the truth about you. I've investigated the charge the workers put on you. The chief engineer has decided that the workers... will now work for a government contractor. Three cheers for the engineer! - What are you saying! - Your contract has been canceled. You may begin work. - Listen, Mr. Mathur. No, Mr. Mohan I won't hear anything more about this matter. If you want to say anything, come to my office. Bravo, Ranjit! This happened because of you. Cheers for Ranjit! Sit here. I'll go and inform him. - You have business with me? - Hello, Mrs. Mathur. Hello. My husband came in the evening and left again for work. - I came to meet you. - Tell me. You must have heard about my misfortune. But you alone are responsible for it. I agree Mrs. Mathur. But sometimes man makes mistakes. And he can be forgiven for it. Can't I be given another chance? My husband understands his job well. I don't consider it right to interfere in his work. - You're back? - Yes, and I'm very tired today. Mohan Singh came. Did you see him on the way? - No. - He came apologize. - He wanted one more chance. - Never! I hate him. He's so cheap that he can sell his country for his personal benefit. He left this envelope. Maybe you'll change your mind after you see it. - The brazen man! The rascal! - What is this? Money? A bribe! How disgusting! - He left just now? - Yes. I'll meet him on the way. What's this? Killing him will mean one less enemy of the country. Give that to me! Wait! I'm coming, too - Why would you come? - I can't go alone at this hour. You went to my house today, and gave this to my wife? - This money? - Yes. What are you thinking? You're trying to bribe me? - Don't misunderstand me, sir. - I understand you only too well. Because of greedy traitors like you... hurdles are put in our country's progress For your personal benefit, you want to ruin millions of people? I don't even want to see your face! Come here. Listen. What are you looking at? The stars. Don't look at them. People say stars change our destiny. False! Father says that good people become stars and shine in the sky after death. - Rubbish! - Really! Don't you know? - No. - The big stars are big people. - Really? - Yes. Then even I'll become a star. Why will you become a star? What good work have you done? I'm making the dam. Isn't that good work? Yes. Then you and I will be together. Know who has the right to stay together? A wife. Gauri, before all these big personalities today... I accept you as my wife. Oh naughty stars Don't look at us Our love is new Why does your lovely face feel shy? Our eyes met and the heart got scared Your naughty eyes lowered, just giving me one look Tell me, what are you hiding in your eyes? I have stolen you, and am holding you... in my eyes as kohl You stole my sleep. You stole my heart These wet sights are making gestures This is the season to meet, time favors us Hear what the stars say, my darling I have seen the beloveds of many separating - Sister! - Gulab? - Yes, it's his voice. - Hurry, let's go! - Sister! - What happened, Gulab? - Father was beaten. - Who beat him? - I don't know. - Hurry! Let's go. - Where are you hiding that boy? - I don't know. You don't know? You're making your daughter woo him for greed of gold... - and say you don't know? - Shut up! Father... father! Father! Oh God! Who did this to you? Don't worry, I'll be fine. - You're bleeding! - Don't touch me! - Get out of my sight! Go! - What have I done? You have tainted my honor. You have cheated me. Cheated you? What are you saying? This is how you repaid us for our decency? You not only slurred Gauri's name, you put my old age prestige to dust. You have misunderstood me, father. I love Gauri. I want to marry her. Quiet! You think I don't know the truth about you? I know all too well. You're a criminal who's been to jail. You can't marry my daughter as long as I'm alive. Oh. I sure am a criminal who's been to jail. For a moment, I slipped. But I've told Gauri everything about me. I didn't hide anything from her. - Father, he's not lying. - You keep quiet! - And that gold? - Even that's true. - Oh. So those two men were right. - Who? The men who did this to me. Okay, now I understand. I thought many times to tell you everything. - But I didn't get a chance. - Or you didn't want to confess? You misunderstand me, Baba. I don't yearn for that gold. Just think, the gold for which I served a sentence of five years... I could have taken it and disappeared whenever I wanted. - Then why didn't you? - For Gauri's sake. For this dam, for the new world that's being created. I'm not the same Ranjit anymore, that come here. Living with you people, I learned living alone isn't life. Life is living with everyone. And I tried to become an honest man. - But you... - Son! Ranjit... Ranjit! - What are you doing? - Move aside, Gauri! What are you doing! What's wrong with you? I'm doing what I should have done long ago. I'll hand over the gold to the government. Only then will I find peace. The tainted heart will be cleansed. Bravo, son! The human in you has really awakened today. Son, I made a mistake in recognizing you. Come on, dig. - Oh my! So much gold! - Quiet! Son, this is a very dangerous thing. Take it from here now. Father, I'll come along too. No dear, it's late. Gulab is alone at home. You stay here. Father, come back soon. I'm worried. Don't worry, we'll be back soon. - Gauri, close the door properly. - Okay. Ranjit, you go! I'll handle them. Ranjit has run away! There he is! He was just here. Where did he go? Why are you asking me? Look for him! Yes. - Father! - Ranjit? Son, I'm here. - Are you hurt? - Don't worry about me. - Where's the gold? - I've hid it amid stones. - Could the rogues have seen it? - No, they didn't. When the minister comes tomorrow, I'll give him the gold. That's okay. Neither would I trust you, nor would this mess happen. Because of you, my business in Bombay was ruined, my contract got canceled. - Now I'm losing the gold. - Where can the gold go? He has surely hidden it somewhere, or he wouldn't go back empty handed. - I left Chandar there to keep watch. - Keep your thoughts to yourself. You're both useless. Now whatever has to be done, I'll do it myself. Come! - Bhola. - Yes, sir? - All arrangements have been made? - Yes, sir. - But who will garland him? - You. - No. - Then Mrs. Mathur? Why me? The one who inspired you during this great task... of building the dam, ask him to do this. - Who are you talking about? - Laxmandas. - Right! Bhola, go and tell him. - Yes, sir. Father, all arrangements have been made here. - I should leave now. - Go. But come back soon. Don't worry, father. Take a seat. Respected Minister, brothers and sisters... today, on 15th August is a very big festival for free India. On this occasion, the Minister has honored us by his presence. Thanking him for it, and on behalf of the 30,000 people working here... I welcome him. - Laxmandas, you? - You recognized me? - How can I forget you? - I'm honored! - But why are you here? - I work here. He's come! Mr. Mohan, there's not much time to get the reward for our efforts. Whose effort? The effort is only of one man. Me. - What? - You couldn't do anything. Your beauty, your style, was all a waste. - Meaning? - It's very clear. Only the one who gets something has a right to it. That means, you don't want to give me my share of gold. - No question of it. - You're cheating me! - Think what you like. - But I will take my share of gold! - She's dead. - Throw her in the river. Ranjit! - Ranjit! - Go catch Gauri. Now we'll see how I get the gold now! - Mr. Mohan? - Ranjit, give me the gold. Never! I always suspected you were involved in this. Stop your nonsense! Hand over the gold to me, or I'll shoot you. I'm not the kind to fear the threats of traitors like you. Shoot! Not you. Ranjit! If you care for her life, hand over the gold to me! - Leave Gauri. - I do business, Ranjit. I'll take gold with this hand, and release her with this. Give me the gold. - Give! - No Ranjit, don't give him the gold. No Gauri, the gold isn't more precious than you. Ranjit, don't give him the gold. - Oh my! Help! - Gauri, you run away from here! No, I won't run away. Help! Someone help Ranjit! Bahadur, take this! Ranjit! Ranjit, the mountain is going to explode. Run! Ranjit! Ranjit, Ranjit! Ranjit, why don't you speak? Ranjit, why don't you open your eyes? Gauri, take me from here. - Anyone around! - Ranjit is badly hurt. Lift Ranjit. Father! Father! Father, take care of him. - Ranjit, what happened to you? - Son, what happened? Laxmandasji, who is he? What happened to him? He's Ranjit, Mr. Sharma. I told you about him. - But he is... - Minister, I had this over to you. The sin I committed, it's atonement. My job is done. No... no! Ranjit! No Ranjit, your work isn't over yet. It's just begun. The country needs brave young men like you. Ranjit, get up. The foundation of the dam is calling you. - All your work is incomplete. - Your life is very precious. If man has courage, he can overcome death. Get up! Hear what everyone is saying. Get up. - Get up. - Come, son. Hardworking man rose! The generous nature will give everything All mountains on the way will crumble, just sweat it out Hardworking man rose! The destiny of earth shined Great! That dust turns to gold that we touch - Hard work... - Is what it's all about - Hard work... - Is the real support - Hard work... - Is our slogan!
