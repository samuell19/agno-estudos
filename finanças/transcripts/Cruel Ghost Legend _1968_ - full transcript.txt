Cruel Ghost Legend Based on a work by Rentaro Shibata Starring Masakazu Tamura Saeda Kawaguchi Yusuke Kawazu Nobuo Kaneko Rokko Toura Directed by Kazuo Hase It'll be New Year's Eve in three days. How's your husband? The money I lent him comes due this spring. I hope you're listening. Your wife is very sick. Since I can't see, I find it easy to turn a blind eye to things. What is this? The lord's indiscretions... have manifested themselves... on his mistress's pressure points. Sojun! Are you going to pay before New Year's Eve? - I'll pay you. - How are you going to do that? I don't have any money. You're bold, I'll give you that. My wife will pay with her body. The wife of a ranking samurai is worth 12 pieces of gold. - It will pay off the interest. - My lord! - As your husband, I allow it. - That's cruel! Lord, I can't accept your offer. It's out of the question. She's worth money. You can get money for her. My word is final. Damn, he's bold. This is the deal he had in mind? - I've seen buffoons like this before... - My lord, I beg of you. I'm from a prominent samurai family. I'd rather die! She wants to die? I get sick of hearing it. I'm sure the pressure point whet her appetite something fierce. I don't believe a word of it. Sojun. Fuck her... My memory of you bedding my wife will go nicely with my sake. You've certainly got a way with words! I'll enjoy the spectacle and then it will be water under the bridge. Toyo... let this filthy old bastard do as he pleases. Just a second. What? 1-2-3-4-5 pieces of gold. In exchange for one night here with your mistress. I'll take it. In return, the interest and principal will remain at 26 pieces of gold. You're offering a miserable five pieces of gold for the wife of a samurai?! Be careful, he's furious... Don't test him. Lord, I shall do exactly as you have said. Mistress, I ask for your favor in this matter. Shall we begin? You came back! It's usury! I... want... my money! Backstabber! You're going to kill me? Son of a bitch! Gimme my money! You'll go to hell! Murderer! You were all in on this together! You backstabber! Money! The money! Suga, Ohana, you were planning this all along! You killed your own father over money! Go to hell! Usurer! Shinichiro! Help me. We'll throw him in the river. Suga, Ohana, I'm not giving you any of the money! Suga! Ohana! Ohana! Suga! Shinichiro! My lord! My lord... - It's that little rascal. - Shinzo? Yes. He's not your wife's son, is he? He's the son of the girl who runs the restaurant by Fukagawa Hachiman Shrine. Did you let her live here, like you did me? Don't be absurd. It was just a fling. And you left her? You're awful! You'll do the same thing to me. Give it a rest. - My lord... Look. - What? - My tummy. - Why? - My boobs. - What's wrong with them? I'm pregnant. - A baby? - It's yours and mine. Keep it if you want. This is wonderful... Your bloodline is flowing inside me. I'm sure it'll be a little devil. Why? - It'll be just like you. - He'll be like you, too. Although sometimes they don't resemble either parent. Take me, just one more time. You're incorrigible. How true... My lord. You must be ashamed to have me as a father. You hate me, but at least you don't take after me. Study Confucius and practice the military arts. Don't be like me, earn the yearly rice of 600 peasants... and rebuild the house of Fukaya. And don't complicate your life... with women. My lord... I'm cold. Come and warm me up. Harlot! Does this half pint really intend to kill me? Not a chance. He's a stranger to the world of women. He's melting just looking into my eyes. Nicely done, little man. Strumpet! I'll kill you! I'll teach you. I'll give you a taste of the juice of a woman. You're shaking. Are you scared? I'll kill you. You kill me, I'll kill you, and we can go to heaven together. Don't rush, take it slow. Shinichiro... Shinichiro... You're dreaming. Shinichiro? Shinichiro isn't here. He ran off in early spring. What a nuisance! Maybe I'll just poison her. Excuse me. What is it? Who the hell are you? I apologize for coming unannounced. I think I have the wrong house. Please accept my apologies. My lord... I need acupuncture. Please. - If you'll excuse me. - Wait. Can you treat my wife? Certainly, sir. God, what a mess... This place is going to stink. You miserable brat! Take that! What is it? He did it again. He wets the bed every night. There's no time to even dry out the futon. It stinks! - Ain't he a hell spawn! - It isn't funny. God, it's hot! I can't take her constant moaning. It makes my guts rot. She scowls at me every time I go in the room. She's figured out how things are between us. I can't take it. Maybe I'll go to the summer festival. Do you want to see the festival, little fella? But you have to stop wetting the bed. - Do we have any sake? - I don't know. Sojun, you bastard! I want my money! You'll go to hell! Toyo! Toyo! Sojun, you bastard! Die! It's like a haunted house. I have to disappear. I don't want to get mixed up in this. I wonder if they have any money? I really doubt it... Where is that brat? Who cares? Someone will take care of you, you bedwetting rugrat. GRAVE OF SHINZAEMON FUKAYA The house of Fukaya, with its yearly rice production of 600 peasants has fallen. The whereabouts of my half-brother, Shinzo, are unknown. I've changed, too... After going to Edo, I joined the bandits of Mikawa. We broke into storehouses and killed travelers on the road. Many of these crimes over the last five years have just been for kicks. Who's that? I bet that old fool has money... - What are you doing?! - Don't stop me! Don't be so rash! Ohana, help me! Sir, please consider what you're doing! Nice and easy... Sir! Think it through before taking any rash actions. My name is Sobei Shimofusaya. I'll help you any way I can. Tell me what's wrong. - Men aren't supposed to cry! - Shut up! Let's stand up. We'll go to my house. I run a pawnshop in Yanaka. In such a heartless world, I'm humbled by your kindness. Ohana, you go ahead and fix our guest a hot bath. - Is she your daughter? - No, my maid. - My name is Ohana. - Ohana? It's a pleasure to meet you. She looks like she needs some lovin'. This is a plum chance. PAWN SHOP Everything was going according to plan. I got on the old guy's good side. I told him that I wanted to open a fencing school in town. He proposed that I marry his youngest daughter. This is the easiest mark that's ever fallen in my lap, but his daughter is only eight, so I'll have to play around until she's grown. Still, I'm living high on the hog. Oh, someone's here. It's that broad. - I have tea for you. - Thank you. It's beautiful weather. I feel a million miles away. The more I look at her, the more I can see that she's as horny as a stray bitch. Is your master away? Yes, he and the other people at the store went to visit the temple. A monthly visit? Yes, on the 15th of the month. I'm going to rest for a moment. The master took his daughter with him. The little one. Your future bride. That's a long way in the future. Your patience is appreciated... but we're alone today. I guess she's finally ready for action. A bump. Right here. - I can't see it. - Can't you feel it? I probably got it from training. But it's a bad omen. Forget about it. My big brother had a similar bump and he died. We should lance and drain it. Lance it? I may not look like it, but I can do acupuncture. Really? Does it hurt? No, it feels nice. Glad to hear it. You're good at it. My father was an acupuncturist. Really? Yes, he died five years ago. You don't say? My daughter... Ohana... Suga... - Ohana... - What? Shinichiro: Nothing. You're strange. Half-spoken thoughts... What is it? Tell me? Please. Come on. You said your brother had a lump and later died. I made it up. You did? I just wanted to be alone with you. You lied. - I have an older sister. - You do? But I haven't seen her in a very long time. I've never had good luck. Shinichiro! Get off of me! You tramp. But why? Don't touch me! I love you! Take me! We'll kill each other and go to heaven together. You're so good! Do it rougher! I belong to the old man... but it's you I love! I love you so much! More! Give it to me harder! I can't believe it! She passed out! Ouch, get off of my shoulder! Everyone will be coming home soon. I can't afford to be found like this. Wake up, Ohana. I can't believe you. I've never met a broad like you. Ohana... Ohana! Goddamn! Since Ohana died, there's no reason not to steal this. I didn't expect an opportunity to exploit my skills in cracking into storehouses. Ohana! Ohana! Ohana, we're home. - What's she doing there? - Dad, she's asleep. The second I leave this house, she sloughs off her job. Where's Shinichiro? Get up, Ohana. She's naked! - Wasn't the storehouse locked? - I'm sure of it. - Was the lock broken? - Look, here! It's all gone! It was Shinichiro! Find him! Get my money back! Sir! ISSAI KUROZAKA FENCING SCHOOL I'm so happy you came. Since I lost use of my arms and legs, I lost almost all of my students. As you can see, it's pitiful. When I heard that you had fallen ill, I came at once, out of duty as your student. You're so kind. Sensei, if there is anything at all I can do for you, please ask. I owe you a great deal. Well, since you were always a good boy... You learned the fighting arts and you studied letters as well. In my heart, I always thought of you as the successor... to my fencing school. It was my dream. What a stroke of luck. It looks like I'll be taking over the fencing school. Shinichiro. Why don't you take over the school for me? I, Shinichiro Fukaya, accept this honor. Oh, thank you! Welcome. I've never seen her before... This is my adopted daughter, Tae. An honor to meet you. This is one of my most promising students, Shinichiro Fukaya. An honor to meet you. The broad's shaking... She's as innocent as the old man. She's probably a virgin. I'll teach you new worlds of pleasure! Rebuilding the school was no mean feat... Repairing its reputation was the hardest part. I spent every cent of the money that I stole from the pawnbroker in a year. Then, I saw a chance to make some quick money... What are you doing? Your money! Or I'll kill you! Get out of here! Dammit! You are under arrest, Shinichiro Fukaya! Come quietly! Tae! Tae! He's calling you. I can't stand the old goat. That broken down old man still has his appetites. He puts his hands all over me when I change his diapers. I can't take it. You've changed. I wonder who changed me. Our vigorous coupling is no doubt to blame. Your body. I'll go check on him. - Let him be. - I can't. It's my job, but he stinks. I'll be back soon. Bring me some sake. Tae! You're walking, sensei. Shinichiro! You bastard! What's the matter? How long did you think you could keep up this ruse? Then you heard everything. You bit the hand that feeds. Tae: Please, stop! Dammit! The police on my trail! Idiots! Greenhorn beat cops! How did this come to pass? Come quietly! What has become of me? How did it come to this? The last six or seven years feel as if they had been a single day. Let's get this straight. You're not even going to have food on the table. I loaned you money, and it's New Year's Eve in three days. I'll pay you with interest... with my wife's body. Mother! Mother! It smelled... An unpleasant odor. It was my father's smell... The smell of his whores. You kill me, I'll kill you, and we can go to heaven together. So this is the highwayman. He killed the couple on the bridge. Vermin! I'm going to enjoy watching you die slowly. Go to hell! No one weeps for a murderer. Wench! Fool! Do you have any idea how I feel! I knew you'd come to a bad end. You're a bad seed. It makes me sick. In these cases, you always get beheaded at Kozukappara prison. Then, they put your head on display. I almost forgot, Shinichiro had a half-brother by another woman. His name was Shinzo. The brat was always wetting his pants. TEN YEARS LATER - I'm bored. - Why? Just because. What would make it interesting? You want to fool around? That's boring, too. You've got the heart of a woman, but the body of a child. You said that you wanted to marry me. - Yeah, so? - I want money. I'm sick of waitressing in a noodle shop. And you're just a carpenter. There's no future in being a pauper. I want to eat fine foods, wear fine clothes. Even my hair ornaments are junky. That's why I'm bored. - These days, you have to be a fool to be honest. - How true. I'm going to show you that I'm not small time. - What are you going to do? - Something. You know I love you... Your face when you're thinking bad thoughts. - What a stupid thing to say. - It's true. - I have to go to work. I'll come along. I've a lot of deliveries to make. - I'll be waiting for you. - At 10? - At the usual place. - It's a promise. PUPPETEERING INSTRUCTOR TOYOSUGA - Good morning. - Oh, it's you. - You're late. - Yeah, I guess. I hope you're not staying out too late. You're blushing. How sweet. Actually, my mother's taken sick. I thought you didn't have a mother. You told me before that you were an orphan. This is embarrassing. Were you lying? No, it's true. You sure have trouble making sense. I'm sorry. If you don't tell the truth, I won't let you go tonight. - But my boss will be furious. - Then, tell me. Hey, maybe... I should be your mother. You can suckle at my breast. I'll let you suck all you like. Her tits are huge! I'd be happy to suck on them, but it wouldn't be fair to Ohisa. You're too handsome to be a mere carpenter. You should have been a kabuki actor. Miss Ohisa, please don't joke like that. - You're more or less finished with your work, aren't you? - Yes. Then we won't be meeting each other anymore... Hey, how would you like to be scolded by your boss? What? I'll make it worth your while. I'll let you go back to work tomorrow. Scolded? I sleep in the storeroom above the office. Then the boss won't scold you. - You're talking crazy. - Then don't go. Or you'll never taste the pleasures of an innocent girl. More deeply. I'll teach you how good it can be. Don't make me laugh! She's a former prostitute rescued by some old rich guy who up and croaked. She flirts with me every time I come. I'm sure that she has plenty of money and... that she got it begging and grifting. She's at it again! There'll be stains on the futon tomorrow! - My back hurts. - Hey. - Yes, madam. - Stop muttering to yourself. Go take a bath. - I'll go at once, madam. - Wash yourself properly. I will, madam. - Don't worry about locking up. - Really? I don't think anyone will come at this hour. Then I'll take my leave, madam. I don't care what you think. Hey, come on down. It's been a long time... Since I've been with a man. Come closer. I imagine that you're no stranger to the red light district. I wouldn't know about that. Don't you like me? Don't be absurd. Then come here. I'll keep you warm. Thank you for your hospitality. You're young. Manly. Experienced. I've no one else worth giving myself to. Shinzo! I'll turn out the light. Forget about it! The broad had to have plenty of spare cash lying around. It shouldn't take six months to get my hands on it. I forgot, I bet it's already past 10 o'clock. This is getting gross. She's drenched with sweat. She's so sweaty. It's not easy acting innocent and naive. I can't get in the mood with a dumpy old broad like her. Someone's here. - Who cares? - But... It's the maid. Don't worry. - It's you! - You son of a bitch! Strumpet! What do you think you're doing! Please, stop! Shinzo, what is this? I was waiting at the usual place at 10. I'll explain everything later. - I don't want to hear your excuses. Hey, bitch! - What? - He's my boyfriend! - Oh, really? Touch him again and I'll kill you. If you're so worried, why don't you put him on a leash? - What did you say? - He's the one who hit on me. - Hey, tell the truth. - Isn't it the truth? I said it was late and you should go home. You held me down. You snuck up on me. I said stop, but you forced yourself on me. - That's a lie. - Oh, is it now? Then why would I leave the front door unlocked? If I'd planned to seduce you, you'd think I'd have been more cautious. What do you think, young lady? Does it make sense? Now, now. I'll explain everything later. Let's just go home. She's a customer. I'll take care of you, honey. Stop it! Ohisa, get a hold of yourself! How dare you! Hair is a woman's lifeblood. My beautiful hair! I'll kill you! That hurts! Help! Miss Suga, please stop! It's my fault! Don't do it! Suga, I'm begging you! Are you all right, Ohisa? You bitch! You tried to kill me! Stop! That's enough! Let's go home. I wonder what that was about. Young people these days! Miss Suga, whatever happened to you? I don't know, but you must be more careful. Can you help me? Please stay the night with me. I'm so lonely. Shinzo. Old goat! You only give me a trifling amount of money each month. You're not fit to be a father! You can take your money with you to hell! You tormented our mother to death! You evil old pervert! Tonight, I'm going to take it all and escape forever! Listen, I'm talking to you, Suga and Ohana... This old man is not giving you one red cent. I'm taking the money with me to hell! - It was about money. - Yes, money. She was rich. I wouldn't have sex with that hag for the fun of it. - Gold bullion. - You seduced her for the gold? No, she seduced me. Don't be angry. How about you? What do you mean? You're messing around with your boss. With the greengrocer, too. - Are you jealous? - It's tit for tat. Maybe you're right. My guess is that she has around 400 gold pieces. You could live the good life for 10 years with that money. In a house with a black fence and pine trees in the garden. And eat till I'm fat. You can have it all. Shinzo, take me. - What's the matter?! - Something's stuck in my kimono. How disgusting! It's the hunk of that hag's hair you ripped out. I quit my job and moved in with the disfigured puppet teacher. Her students had long since left, and she seemed very alone. She demanded sex all day. She saw several doctors, but they just shrugged. She feverishly doused herself with ointments and swallowed pills, but it did no good. The more disfigured her face became, the more amorous she became, and the stingier she became. I couldn't take it. - Seconds? - Just a little. You don't eat anymore. Do I really disgust you that much? Don't worry, I know the answer. You're living with a monster. It must be awful. Still, I won't let you go. Here, just one bite. It's your fault that this happened to me. Come to think of it, it was that minx from the noodle shop. You were banging her. She did this to me. Just try leaving me. I'll rip your throat out. I'm just joking. Who could do such a thing to someone as sweet as you? Tea. Another eerie night. No matter how many times I told myself her hideous face was my ticket to easy street, it still gave me the shivers. The gold... The gold... This is all for the gold. Dammit! Why doesn't she cover her face?! Once she's out of the picture, I'm out of here! So that's where she'd been hiding the money. She must've been worried about it for some reason. You look so sweet. - Your hands are cold. - You're awake? - What time is it? - It's not morning yet. I brought you gold. Look, a gold coin. Don't you like gold? I'm begging you, please don't leave me. She had weakened considerably. What in the hell was she thinking, giving me a single gold coin? Soon I'll have hundreds of them. Maybe more. Hey, Ohisa. Here's a little bauble. Keep it. A gold coin! - All of a sudden you like me. - Honey! Tomorrow, we'll have more than we know what to do with. - Really? - I found where she hid them. - Really? I am a samurai, after all. We'll take off together tomorrow. Your plan worked! We'll meet at dawn tomorrow, at Senju bridge. I'll take care of my mom. I hope that old lady doesn't give us any trouble. If I'm caught, I'll just kick her out of the way. You're the breadwinner in the family. I'll slap her around if she makes a fuss. Good idea. Slap her around and kick her out of the way! Bingo! The whole enchilada. 300 pieces of gold... No, 500. I'll check later. I'll be long gone before she finds out. You wretch! You've betrayed me! Give it back! Give me the money! I even want the gold piece I gave you yesterday! I won't let you have it. It's mine! I'll take you to hell! Let go! Devil! The horny hag is dead. That'll do. Oh, joy! I got what I came for. The fruit of my labor. I can't wait to see Ohisa's face... when I show her the money. - Where the hell d'you think you're going?! - What was that for? - I asked you where you were going! - None of your business! - Brat! Ohisa, wait! Do you know where you were born? - You found me in a pumpkin patch! - Fool! Your father was a ranking samurai entitled to a yearly rice production of 600 peasants. I ate nothing but hog slop. Finally you're old enough to work, and you turn your back on your mother to run away with some carpenter! Just try to throw me away! Demon hag! I'm no demon hag! I'll see you work until there's nothing left to you! Let me go! Let me go, I say! I can't believe that you'd leave your own mother in the back. - You're not my mother! - What? - Goodbye! - Wait! - They're beautiful! - You think so, too? - What did you do with the monster woman? - I got rid of her. - Perfect! - You think so? So you slayed the monster woman! They're so shiny and jangly. Jangly and shiny! - Hey, look! - What? What is that? Let's go! He's going to be beheaded at Kozukappara prison! - I hear he's a serious criminal. - He's from a prominent samurai family. A prominent family, you say? Yeah. They caught him once 10 years ago, but he escaped. - He busted out? - He's finally going to get what's coming to him. What a scoundrel! Let's have ourselves a look see. So that's him. He's got ice water in his veins. I'm a descendant of the same prominent samurai family. A likely story. My mother said so. I wouldn't put too much stock by what she says. - I guess so. - My old boss once told me... - What? - that my parents were of the Fukaya samurai family. - Really? He said that he found me in an abandoned mansion. - The boss did? - He said so. I disowned by mother. - I disowned my boss. - I did it for you. I did it for you. In the pouring rain... That's what my boss said. Oh, in the samurai mansion? He said I was bawling... Goodbye, bedwetting brat! The baby is kicking. I wish I'd never gotten pregnant. KASANUGAFUCHI Hurry! It hurts! - What's the matter? - My stomach! - You've caught a chill. - I'm OK. - Stay strong. - Please hold me. This way. - I'm really in pain. - Don't fall apart on me. - Let's hurry. Hanyu village is close. There's a café there. My stomach hurts. I'll carry you. Ohisa! Ohisa! Help! Please! Hold on, I'm coming! I would like to ask the condemned, do you have any last words? Do you have any last words?! I have a younger half-brother... Is that all? Shinzo! Ohisa! Where are you, Ohisa?! Here! Help! - Give me your hand! - I can't. My leg hurts! I wonder if she cut herself on the sickle? Hold me. I'm cold. OK, hold tight. You demon hag! Stop, Shinzo! Ohisa! Ohisa! Please don't die! "Shinichiro, disowned from his family and having no last name, "although having been the eldest son of the high-ranking samurai Shinzaemon Fukaya, "possessed an inherently evil nature, and 14 years ago murdered... "the maid of a pawnbroker in Yanaka who had taken him into his home... "and robbed his storehouse of 300 pieces of gold. "Later, he murdered his fencing instructor Issai Kurosaka and his adopted daughter Tae, "and was also a bandit and a robber. Immediately before his execution was to take place, "he escaped and could not be found for an extended period. "Now that he has been captured, he is to be executed and his body used to test swords." The eldest son of Shinzaemon Fukaya... He's my brother. You're my brother... My big brother. You're the carpenter Shinzo, aren't you? Who are you? Aren't you... Ohisa's mother? I want my daughter back. I don't know what you did with her, but I want her back. I bore her out of wedlock with a high-ranking samurai. She's the half-sister of this pig. What did you say? Her father, Shinzaemon, was a bad man, so I didn't expect much from his son. But when I heard the son's head was on display, I had to bear witness to his humiliation. Meeting you here was no coincidence. He brought us here. Where's Ohisa? A simple answer will do. Give me money! I struggled to raise her in the hope that she could make money... when she was an adult. I just wanted an easy life. Give me Ohisa! Shinzo! - That head is my brother. - What?! Ohisa... was my... half-sister. The product of bad karma! You're that brat who always wet himself! Ohisa's... dead. Liar! With this scythe... It was an accident. I killed her. You killed Ohisa with the scythe? You're little sister, and I killed her! I killed her! Forgive me, Ohisa! I didn't know! Damn! Gold coins... You sold my daughter as a whore! That makes it mine! Give it to me! Hand it over! I'll follow you to hell! Die! THE END English translation: scannon Timing: lordretsudo
