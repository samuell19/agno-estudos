( gasps ) Anna: JUST LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. - Krystyna: HUH? - YOUR HANDS ARE JUST LIKE A LITTLE GIRL'S. Krystyna: DO YOU LOVE DANIEL? Anna: DANIEL? DANIEL EXISTS PRECISELY NOT TO BE LOVED. YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL SKIN. Krystyna: AND YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY. ( Anna chuckles ) Anna: YES, I STILL DO. I LOVE ONLY TONDA. Krystyna: WHO'S TONDA? Anna: MY HUSBAND-- MY EX-HUSBAND. YOU NEVER HEARD OF HIM? HMM. HE WAS THE BEST CZECH FILM DIRECTOR. ALL OF EUROPE WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM. AND I WAS HIS LEADING LADY. THIS WAS YEARS AGO, BUT I STARRED IN NEARLY EVERY OTHER FILM. THEN WE GOT MARRIED. WE WENT TO ALL THE FESTIVALS-- BERLIN, VENICE, CANNES. AND THEN I GOT PREGNANT. - PREGNANT? - MMM. ONE DAY, TONDA WENT TO PARIS AND I STAYED BEHIND. TWO DAYS LATER, THE RUSSIAN TANKS ROLLED IN AND OUR DREAM WAS OVER. I TRIED TO JOIN THEM, BUT MY PASSPORT WAS REFUSED. REFUSED? I PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE. YOU KNOW WHERE MY BABY WAS BORN? PRISON. DON'T TELL DANIEL. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW THAT. A COUPLE MONTHS LATER, THE BABY DIED. SHE WAS IMPROPERLY IMMUNIZED. IMMUNIZED? DO YOU THINK ANYBODY STOOD UP IN MY DEFENSE? ALL MY FRIENDS WERE SO BUSY BEING AFRAID. NOBODY EVEN WANTED TO TALK TO ME. WHEN I GOT OUT OF PRISON, EVERYBODY PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW ME. I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY GOODBYE TO ANYBODY WHEN I LEFT THAT COUNTRY. ( sighs ) YOU SEE, I NEARLY KILLED A MAN IN PRAGUE ONE DAY. HE WAS BACKSTABBING TONDA. AND HE WAS OFFENDING MY COUNTRY. WE WERE IN A CLUB AND HE WAS DRUNK AND HE STOOD UP ON A TABLE AND HE LIFTED UP HIS CHAMPAGNE AND HE SAID, "CZECHS ARE FINISHED!" AND THEN HE PULLED DOWN HIS PANTS AND HE PISSED ON THE CZECH FLAG ON THE TABLE. I PICKED UP THE NEAREST ASHTRAY. I SMASHED IT ON HIS HEAD AND I BROKE HIS SKULL AND NEARLY KILLED HIM. AND HE WAS THE SON OF A RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. ( laughs ) THEY THREW ME IN JAIL FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY SAID I COULD ONLY GET OUT ON CONDITION THAT I LEAVE THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY. ( sighs ) TONDA HAD BEEN IN NEW YORK ALL THIS TIME, SO I AGREED. NEW LIFE, GREAT LOVE, BUT WHEN I GOT TO AMERICA, IT WAS TOO LATE. ( sighs ) HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO REMEMBER. HE HAD BECOME MORE AMERICAN THAN ALL OF THE AMERICANS-- ELEGANT APARTMENT, FAMOUS FRIENDS, KING OF NEW YORK. NOW... HE DOES COMMERCIALS-- MTV. ( sighs ) I WAS GETTING IN HIS WAY.

Interviewer: ...being a model as well as an actress? Well, actually, when I was little, I looked more like a chicken. - ( studio audience laughs ) - ( both laugh ) AND MY REAL WISH WAS ACTUALLY TO BE A SECRETARY. ( audience laughing ) So tell us, how did you get the starring role in this movie? Well, um, my friends, they gave a big party for me, and uh, this famous director walked in. And he looked at me and he opened a bottle of champagne - this must be her." - IntervieweJust like that? - Yeah. That's incredible. How lucky for you. So tell me about your parents. Tell me about your growing up. Krystyna: Well, uh, my father-- he died in 1968. He was crushed by a Russian tank in the invasion. And my mother, she was a big Czechoslovakian movie star, and she was in America at the time and she wasn't allowed to come back home. So I grew up in an orphanage, you know, and I was always dreaming about the day I would see my mother again. - Interviewer: You grew up in an orphanage? - Yeah. You know, Czechoslovakian orphanage is like-- they want to make you into little Communists, you know. And you have to recite Russian poems and speak Russian all the time and everything. And, uh, I met this young boy there-- uh-- Tonda and we fell in love... Hey-- Anna-- Interviewer: Childhood sweetheart. Krystyna: Sort of. Interviewer: What do you mean? Well, you see, um-- one day this Russian Ambassador came to our orphanage. And he was behaving very offensively and he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, the Czechs are finished." And so Tonda hit him. But he was outnumbered, so you know, they started hitting him in the face and the stomach and everything. And so I grabbed a bottle and I hit the Ambassador on the head with it. Krystyna: Well, Tonda got sentenced to death. And I had a baby in prison. ANNA, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS IN PRISON LIKE YOU. Interviewer: You're a mother? Krystyna: Yeah, I had a little boy, but he wasn't properly immunized. So, uh, he died just a few days after the birth. Interviewer: I'm so sorry. - Well, you know-- - And then you decided to come to this country? Well, yeah, you know, I thought "I have nothing to lose." There's nothing holding me back here, so you know, - They took away my parents and my husband and my child. - ( door opens ) So I just thought, "Well, I'll leave." - ( door closes ) - So I did. - HI. HOW WAS I? - HI. - DID YOU SEE IT? - YEAH. Krystyna on TV: I was destined to live in a free country. I always knew it. You know, there you can't even think about it. You can't even dream about it. And I feel really terrible - when I think about all my friends.. - ( clattering ) - ( Krystyna continues chattering on TV ) - ANNA? - WHAT IS SHE DOING? - ( chuckles ) - Interviewer: But we're glad you're here. - ANNA?

ANNA HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, BUT IT IS A COMMON THING WITH ACTORS IN AMERICA. WITH THE MONEY I MADE FROM THE FILM, I'M GOING TO TAKE ANNA AND MYSELF TO HAWAII. WOW, DEAR NOODLE, BLUE OCEAN AND A LOT OF FLOWERS AND PALM TREES. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT IN NEW YORK. ANNA THINKS SHE MAY GET MORE WORK IF SHE LOOKS YOUNGER, SO I WANT TO PAY FOR HER FACE-LIFT. THAT'S NORMAL HERE TOO. I'M VERY SORRY I COULDN'T ATTEND GRANDPA'S FUNERAL, BUT I WAS FILMING AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY MAKE IT. I SENT FLOWERS THROUGH A SPECIAL AGENCY. DID YOU GET THEM? I HOPE YOU DID, BECAUSE THEY COST ME A FORTUNE. PLEASE SEND ME MY CHILDHOOD PHOTOS BECAUSE A MAN WANTS TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ME. BOY, I LOVE AMERICA. YOURS, KRYSTYNA.
