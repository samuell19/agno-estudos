Distributed by ATG From year end to New Year, we may forget fire precautions as we're so busy. The Fire Department is starting a fire precaution campaign. Education on fire precaution is now being done. Fire cases have been going down for 20 years, a notable record. This reflects the alertness of our Kyoto citizens. We need your help to make Kyoto a fire-less city. Written, Directed and Edited by Claude Gagnon How's your wife? She's fine. And... Yoshimasa? - He's grown. - In kindergarten? - Yes.

But do you still miss him? I don't know if I'm still thinking of him. I gave him up... but I love him. I see. - You've stopped seeing him? - Right. Is that a good thing? - Is that a good thing or not? - It is. Yes? I feel sorry for Terayama, but [ can't. I just can't. - You can't forget him? - Right. Let's not say that I can't forget him, But I'm through... with men. - Through? - Yes. But you can't forget him either? Right. But you'd better forget him. Right! Married and has kids! - Yes. - Tricky. Yes. Such practical matters... are important to you? You can't ignore that? I can't. So that's it. I can't. Through with men? Through. Let's change the topic. Let's. Hey Where's this place? Somewhere near my high school. - Osaka? - A rare sight, isn't it? I really didn't know you can paint. Next time you'll take me somewhere. For a sketch. OK? Slowly... Isn't that bad? You're up? What do you want for breakfast? Good morning. I have a headache. - You drank a lot. - Too much. Some water? Thanks. Thanks. You OK? Feeling OK? - Like a rock. - Really? I go buy some pills for you? Yes. - Aspirin. - Aspirin? - Any drugstore? - Yes. I think so. I'll buy some for you. The drugstore... you know that "Ken" snack bar? Go pass it, you'll see a post box.

Good morning. Sorry. - Hey you! - Sorry for Saturday. Sorry for what? - Sorry. - For what? How was it? - Such a long date. - Sorry. You always say you'll come, but you never! - Yummy? - We ate your share too! - All of it? - Sure! - Wow! - And we drank. Wow. You drank through the night? That's the plan, but we fell asleep. Of course you did! - I stayed the night there. - You did? - A bad hangover. - Really? You too? Real bad. Let's drink next time. Just like that. You'll come? - Through the night? - Yes. - We won't sleep. - Yes. Let's start working. Well then. I'll be waiting. Bye. Yes. Yes... Come in. Come in! Come in, painter. Yes... Take this... You took an hour! There? - What? - What? Look at that! 1 million deposit... 2 million deposit! Let's go in? - An apartment. - Yes. They may have it inside. - Try it. - Really? There's none. One more. Tired? If it's possible... around 50,000. 50,000 each month. Somewhere cheap to start with. Everybody says so. Everybody wants it cheap and good. But that's impossible. An old place will do. Old or new, it's always the location that sets the rent. Then somewhere a bit far away. Inconvenient... There is one. A house for 50,000 yen a month. - 50,000? - The owner wants 60,000... the owner may say yes to 50,000 for you two. The owner have to see you first. That's mean! Shhh! It's too small for two! And it smells so musty. He didn't tell us that. Let's call him. - You call him. - OK. That's great, thanks! We'll check it out. Bye. One more! There's one more. He knows the owner personally. It's far but available. The owner's son is studying in UK. Two more years. He won't renovate it but that's OK for 2 years. - OK.. - We'll see it first? Hello. I'm Teramoto. All of a sudden, sorry... Don't mention it. Just a few steps from here. Over there. Just 200 metres. It's near. Follow me. Thank you. We're still eating it... No lock. It's old. A bit heavy. Like it? It's old. Wow. What a view! - It's not dusty. - Right. - Easy. - It's clean. Like a granny's. It isn't dirty. It's well kept. The owner's son took good care of it. It really isn't dusty. Quite clean. Not much work to do. On this wood... you can still see where the branches were. It must worth a lot. Scary! I don't dare to touch it. I'm an idiot You're an idiot What are you doing? Swatch! Be careful with this. It's old. So I took it. It's your Mom's? My granny's. - So heavy. - There are bugs. Go. Up. Oh! - What's wrong? - A crack. It isn't used for long. - It's almost dry. - Good. Coming in. Oh! Smart girl. This is perfect. Here I come. I'm so tired. Tired. That slope is steep. Is it raining? Are you done? Wait. - I'm tired. - Hold on. I'm tired! Sorry. You can move your hand now. Sorry. - Thanks! - Thank you! It will flap. - How? - Feel the patch? - Press on it - Press? - Will it flap up and down? - Then tie it tighter. - What is this? - Direction indicator. This is the chock. You won't use it. No? This is the rear brake. This is the front brake. Get it? This is the klaxon. Here? Let's stop here. OK. It's nice here. Hey. What? Work... you'll keep working there? Yes. it's already 6 years, that I've been there. So, I want to start a business if I can. Hey. If I really do so, what should I do? Up to now, I work in fashion. So, I should start a boutique or so. We can... take some prints from our present company. Or get some leftover. I think we can... start a business like that. You agree? You aren't listening? Listen! - A shop? - Yes. Just a little bit more. It's not today or tomorrow, I want to save up some more, maybe 2 or 3 months. There are snack bars, right? After work, I can work at such places until 12. After 2 or 3 months, I'll save enough money. It's too tough. It is. I'll hang on. If I do that, well... I need money... to start up, and keep it running for several months. This must be included. I think 2 or 3 months are enough. So if I do this, I can't do it on my own. So I want you to help me. What do you think? Well... is it possible? Is it possible? If I'm doing it with you, I think it's possible. Me? - Welcome home. - I'm home. It's really late. Yes, very late. - You've been waiting? - Not really. - You're drunk? - No! Am I drunk? - Want some water? - Yes, please. I'm... feeling so high. Like I'm spinning. It's been a while that you drank so much? You said you won't drink for real. Thanks. How do you feel? Very fine. Too fine. I sang. They handed me a mic. "What?" I said. Then they made me sing. "Oh no!" I said. "Just sing what you know." They said. "I don't know any!" Then I sang a folk song. So embarrassing! A lot of young people there. That's good. You come with me next time. I'll introduce you. What are their occupations? Nothing to do with fashion. Really? There's no one you know? - Is there any? - That's embarrassing! - Who? - He works hard in daytime. The supervisor? Never mind! It's a lot of fun there. My boss is a very nice woman. So it's mostly... - male customers. - Really? Managers, nice men. Good. Many male customers. They feel... so old-fashioned. - That kind of men. - Really? - After a drink, they talk freely. - Must be fun. Those men. They may look horny but they mean no harm. You're popular. What if I have to do this every day? Drinking a lot at night. It's just me, drinking against many men every night. That's too much. How about modelling? - Yes, but occasionally. - Hey! For me. Making any progress on your painting? - Today, not much. - You aren't doing it? - I was, just then. - Really? I'll do it for you. When I feel well. - Oh... - I'm so tired today. - Are you? I'll hang on! Stuck? A letter. From who? A love letter? Dad. - What? - From Dad. Your Dad? - Yes. - About what? I don't know. Serious? What is it? I have to go home. Blind date. Don't decide for me! What? I'll choose the one I like. It's just... - for your sake! - Why? It's always our relatives or my brother! That Minoru! I don't care! You're... - not a kid anymore! - That's why... I'll choose the one I like! I'm not a kid! - I... - You stay out of it! Why won't you listen to me? I won't go. I hear that... you do kendo? A bit. And you like hiking? - Yes. - About hiking... in the past, she used to... hike a lot with me... when she's in high school. I see. How about you? Any hiking recently? - No. - What? - I've been so busy... - Oh. In the future, you can take Nakamura to go hiking. How about... to Natsuyama, for example? I hope Nakamura would turn me down. Even if he turns you down, your Dad will find some other men. You're of age. In fact, it depends on you. Better say no if you don't want it, right? Yes... it's been so many times. You went this time. Blind date, yes. I got used to it. If I refuse to go, what would happen? - You OK? - Yes. I woke you up? That's OK. I feel great. - You OK? - I'm OK. It's Saturday. - You shook me. - It's full house. So many orders. Have you set the alarm? - Yes. - We'll go tomorrow. - Yes. - Wake me up. - Can you wake up? - Yes. Oh! It's past 1:30! Just a bit after 1:30. Better sleep now. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Wake me up! Wake me up! - Remember! - Yes. - OK. Kazuyo. It's morning. Kazuyo. Kazuyo. It's morning. It's morning! I'm so sorry! Sorry! Why didn't you wake me up? You were fast asleep. I didn't know I slept so long. Now I'm awake. How was it? It's bad now. It got cloudy suddenly. - Really? - It's cloudy now. But where's the sun? It was just 10 minutes. Now you can't? Tired? No. - Sleepy? - No. It's so cloudy now. What a pity I need to come early next time. Early... let's get up early! My nose... let's get up early? - Let's go. - We'll leave now? - Yes. Well then, that's nothing I can do. OK. Thanks for all these years. I thank you too. Thank you very much. Please tell the others for me. I haven't told them. I will. Thank you. Goodbye. Take care. Please forgive me for... leaving like this. I thought... I could go on living with you... in such bliss. Living with you, meeting you, I was really happy. No one has ever understood me like you did. No one has been so nice to me like you did. There will never be... someone like you. But... it's something... that can't be helped. Having destroyed all these, I. feel so bad about myself. Forever... forever... it's you... that I'll love with all my heart. I. haven't left here. My love will always remain here. I feel so sad, so I took your portrait with me. As if I didn't draw it myself, you'll always be on my side. But... in fact, I'm really very sad.
