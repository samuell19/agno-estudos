I'll allow myself to say ﻿that... ﻿it's a sad ending. ﻿A weighty feeling. ﻿Weighty, because I feel I was forced to step down too soon. ﻿I believe that in terms of performance ﻿especially in terms of striving for peace ﻿and ensuring Israel's security in the best way possible. ﻿I think the State of Israel may have lost ﻿the prime minister ﻿with a better chance than any other ﻿of advancing peace and preventing war. He acted like he didn't care. ﻿that you received at home, as a child? ﻿Wow, that's a tough question ﻿because it means I'll have to define myself. ﻿And there's nothing harder than defining oneself. ﻿It's hard to say. ﻿I think you could say that I'm an introverted person. ﻿I don't know if I'm friendly or unfriendly. ﻿Everyone likes to keep certain things to oneself. ﻿Some people are more expressive ﻿and some.are less expressive. ﻿I think I belong to the second type. ﻿But I think I've remained more or less the same. ﻿My father was born in Russia to a family of laborers ﻿and moved to the U.S. as a young man. ﻿Dunirng World War I ﻿he joined the Hebrew Brigade of the British Army ﻿and that's how he came to Israel. ﻿He stayed in Israel and started a life here. ﻿My mother came from a family of well-to-do merchants. ﻿My mother came with the first ship ﻿of Jews that left Russia in 1919 ﻿and they met. They got married and I was born in 1922. ﻿We always lived like a working class family ﻿in a small apartment. We led a fairly modest life. ﻿Trying to attain material things for oneself ﻿was considered a discredit to the home ﻿and speaking of money was a disgrace. ﻿My mother was a commander in the Jewish Defense Force. ﻿She was on the Tel Aviv city council. ﻿She was a workers' leader. ﻿All the workers' committee meetings were held at our house. ﻿The whole street would come over and ask ﻿how we kids could stand being at home ﻿with all the shouting, and arguments that came up. ﻿A tender mother? Not exactly. ﻿The regime at home: Everyone wakes up on time. Everyone does his chores. ﻿Cleaning, tidying up, cooking, coming home on time. ﻿Food must never be wasted., ﻿If I didn't like my oatmeal ﻿and didn't finish it for breakfast, I'd have to eat it the next day. ﻿The reason was that children are starving all over the world ﻿and food mustn't be wasted. ﻿"At the beginning of the school year, a school for the workers' children will be opened" ﻿My second home was, my school ﻿which imbued me with a love of Israel's landscapes, nature, ﻿the agricultural life,, the social life. ﻿I remember traveling constantly at the time. ﻿I remember visiting Gaza, the road to Jerusalem, ﻿dozens of places, ﻿and I think that that was what made these places accessible and part of me. ﻿Throughout my youth ﻿I saw myself going into a life of farming, kibbutz. ﻿If someone had told me "you'll be an army man," ﻿I'd think that was absurd. ﻿"Medical Certificate. Student Yitzhak-Rabin ﻿"does not suffer fromany-infectious disease and is fit for farm work." ﻿It's difficult to talk about because my mother died when I was young. ﻿I was about 16. ﻿"One day I was called home urgently from Kadoorie. ﻿"My mother had a heart disease ﻿"and whenever she had a heart attack I'd run as fast as I could ﻿"to call the doctor, fearful that when I returned I'd find her dead. ﻿"My sister and I lived in the shadow of fear throughout our childhood. ﻿"Tears filled Father's eyes. I ran to Hadassah Hospital in Tel Aviv. ﻿"I prayed that Mother would still be conscious, that she'd recognize me. ﻿"I wanted only to say goodbye. ﻿"I think she recognized me. She didn't speak. ﻿"I felt like she knew I was coming to see her ﻿"and she mustered the last of her strength to live until I arrived. ﻿"I didn't want to cry. Goodbye, Mother. ﻿"Her eyes were open. She was silent. ﻿"Never did I cry so much, neither before nor after. ﻿"After the mourning period’ I returned to Kadoorie feeling like a young man ﻿"who's just beginning to stand on his own two feet. ﻿"A part of our home is gone. ﻿"I must decide on my way for myself." ﻿Among other things we had to bear the yoke of security. ﻿This was in the middle of the uprisings of '36, '39. ﻿We trained, we learned to use a rifle, ﻿grenade and landmines. ﻿Actually, at the time, I still wasn't thinking at all ﻿in terms of a military career. ﻿I graduated from Kadoorie in 1940 ﻿and since I graduated with honors, ﻿the Mandate Government was willing ﻿to grant me a scholarship in the US ﻿and I wanted to study water engineering. ﻿But then WWII began ﻿and ofcourse it didn't occur to me then ﻿to travel to the U.S. ﻿So when I finished school I went for agricultural training in Ramat Yohanan. ﻿The regional commander of Ramat Yohanan asked me ﻿if I'd volunteer for a special unit that would be given all sorts of tasks. ﻿I was called into the regional commander's office ﻿and there I met Moshe Dayan. ﻿He asked me: "Can you fire a rifle?" ﻿I said yes. ﻿"Can you throw a grenade?" I said yes. ﻿"Have you done so on a firing range?" Yes. ﻿"Can you shoot a submachine gun?" ﻿I said no. ﻿"Can you drive a motorcycle?" ﻿"Can you drive a car?" I said: No, ﻿but I can drive a tractor. ﻿He smiled and said: "Okay, you're in." ﻿What's with these questions? ﻿What do you want to know? -How you met. ﻿We met in Tel Aviv. I was a high school student. ﻿In the spirit of the time, the Palmach fighters ﻿had an aura of mystery and romance ﻿and were admired by 16-year-old high school girls. ﻿And I met Yitzhak and he immediately became my object of admiration' ﻿and that's how it all began ﻿I was still in 10th grade. ﻿Don't tell them everything. ﻿The operation of liberating refugees from the Atlit Detention Camp, ﻿rescuing Holocaust survivors, ﻿releasing Jews who arrived as illegal immigrants ﻿and were up for deportation. ﻿You had to rescue people, knowing full well ﻿that you may get into a confrontation with the British ﻿and still get them out alive. ﻿and I was supposed to attack the British. We weren't familiar with the mentality of the refugees, the Holocaust survivors. ﻿They all came out with their bundles, including the children, ﻿bundles that they refused to part with. ﻿And we started climbing Mt. Carmel toward'Beit Oren. ﻿I told the guys: Let's carry the children. ﻿I took a little boy. ﻿Unfortunately ﻿I felt something warm and wet... ﻿drip down my neck. The poor boy ﻿was so nervous he had an accident. ﻿The sun was rising|by the time we reached Beit Oren. ﻿It was an extraordinary sense ot achievement. ﻿We set the precedent of liberating from a Britishi detention camp ﻿those who were meant to be deported from Israel. ﻿As a brigade leader I had a motorcycle ﻿and I'm driving the motorcycle, I reach Nesher ﻿when a catastrophe takes place. ﻿A car with a stirring wheel on the right hand side ﻿turns where it shouldn't. ﻿I crash into it. I lose consciousness ﻿and find myself in the hospital with a broken leg. ﻿Miraculously not dead. ﻿In fact I couldn't do anything for five or six months. ﻿lived at my father's house in Tel Aviv, ﻿lying there, waiting for my bones to heal. ﻿"Tel Aviv, January 17th, 1946. "Greetings, my dear sister. ﻿"Since my limited time has begun to be divided ﻿between total idleness and partial idleness, ﻿"I've finally found the time and courage to write a literary work ﻿"which now lies before your eyes. ﻿"There's nothing new under the sun, or rather, under our ceiling. ﻿'I'm going crazy with boredom. ﻿"By the way, I don't think you've ever seen me ﻿"in adult's clothing, that is in long pants. ﻿"People tell me that I make a more serious impression in them. ﻿"When I get a chance to show you I'd like to hear what you think. ﻿"You probably know about my math studies. ﻿"I hope to continue in English and political economics." ﻿"Shalom. Your brother" ﻿But punishment is swift. ﻿All adults of the extreme groups are rounded up and an arms search is conducted ﻿as suspects, are taken to detention pens. ﻿And Black Sabbath arrived, June 29th, 1946 ﻿and the British army picked me up at my house ﻿and, of course, arrested my father just in case. ﻿We were taken to the detention camp in Rafiah ﻿where I spent five months or so. ﻿My father was over 60 years old. ﻿Conditions in the detention camp weren't comfortable, ﻿and I had a feeling ﻿that they took my father because of me. ﻿It was a relief to know that my father took it for granted ﻿although he was suffering. Although it was hard. ﻿The fact that we were together in the detention camp ﻿was a support for me. ﻿All his behavior, his feelings, everything he did, ﻿was for one purpose: to make it easier lest I feel that way. ﻿Lest it bother me. Lest it weigh on me. ﻿I'll never forget that period. ﻿You can see Radar Hill from here. ﻿Guys... ﻿Jerusalem felt like a city under siege ﻿It's hard to explain ﻿Shells flying. People afraid to leave their homes. ﻿Water shortage. Food shortage. ﻿In all our wars there was only one case ﻿of a city under siege in the full sense of the word, ﻿with 70,000 or 80,000 Jews under siege. ﻿Men, women and children. ﻿Jerusalem. ﻿We came in a convoy of 300 trucks. ﻿They were firing on us for a kilometer and a half, ﻿I shouted to every manned vehicle: "Open fire." ﻿I went up and brought down a platoon with two armored cars that we stole from the British ﻿to extricate the convoy. ﻿And in fact the convoy was extricated before nightfall, ﻿the brigade moved on to Jerusalem, the road was closed, ﻿with the brigade in very bad shape. ﻿When the Jerusalemites saw this convoy of Palmach troops enter the city ﻿it was an extraordinary feeling. ﻿It is the Jewish people's natural right ﻿to belike every other nation. ﻿Therefore we have gathered, the members of the council... ﻿On May 14th I was there, in one of the rooms, ﻿I don't remember which corner room, ﻿and the soldiers returned here' after five days of battle ﻿and lay down exhausted, 30 or 40 men. ﻿There was a radio in the corner. ﻿Someone turned the radio on and Ben Gurion's voice was heard ﻿declaring... ﻿the establishment of the Jewish State in Israel... ﻿I listened from a distance. The door was open. ﻿Some tired soldier said: ﻿Turn off the radio, we're dying to sleep. We'll hear the announcements tomorrow. ﻿The radio was turned off and everyone fell asleep. ﻿No one gave a damn about those declarations. ﻿They slept. ﻿That's how I heard about the Declaration of the State. ﻿The Jordanian Legion was already inside, ﻿fighting for the Old City, the Jewish Quarter. ﻿Then we saw the Old City surrender. ﻿They gave me a company of youths as reinforcement. ﻿That was one of the toughest moments of the war for me, ﻿they were 16 years old, ﻿they were bombarded ﻿and these children, I think half of them were hit. ﻿I don't remember how many were killed and how many were wounded. ﻿It was a terrible feeling. ﻿15- and 16-y.ear-old boys, ﻿you send them... ﻿And here, in the battles for Jerusalem, on the road to Jerusalem, ﻿I made the decision to stay in the army. ﻿The very moment those boys were killed. ﻿"The residents of Lod must be evacuated immediately ﻿"regardless of age. ﻿Send them toward Beit Naballah. Yitzhak Rabin." ﻿"It was terrible. It was a very hot day. ﻿"They had to walk, carrying their children and fheir belongings. ﻿"Psychologically it was one of our most difficult missions. ﻿"The people of Lod didn't leave their homes willingly. ﻿"There was no way to avoid using our weapons and firing warning shots ﻿"to force the people to walk 15 or 20 km. ﻿"The people of Ramla looked oh and learned their lesson. ﻿"Their leaders agreed to leave of their own accord."

That's hard to say. ﻿I know that they miss me, obviously, ﻿but the fact that ﻿their mother is always at home ﻿makes a big difference. ﻿Obviously, for children, there are two parents, not one. ﻿I'try my best, and not always successfully, ﻿whenever I'm home, not to be troubled ﻿by thoughts that concern me.

General Yitzhak Rabin to the IDF soldiers: ﻿Soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, ﻿I know very well ﻿that the psychological effort required of a soldier ﻿who must wait in suspense ﻿is no less than that required of a soldier charging at the enemy. ﻿Strip, you guys. ﻿Strip, you guys. I'm turning the water on. ﻿When you're done, get out. ﻿Give others a chance. ﻿Lt. Gen. Rabin, you asked the soldiers to be patient. ﻿Did you do so because you think there will be a war ﻿or there won't be a war? ﻿In the current situation, our tangled relations can only be. untangled by the cut of a military sword. ﻿Nasser is waiting for Rabin. ﻿It said in the newspaper that he's waiting. ﻿Based on a Jewish tune, lyrics by Haim Hefer. ﻿Nasser's waiting for Rabin, ay-ay-ay ﻿Nasser's waiting for Rabin, ay-ay-ay ﻿Let him wait right where he is, ay-ay-ay ﻿Because we're coming full-force, ay-ay-ay ﻿Ay-ay-ay... ﻿One more time! ﻿Nasser's waiting for Rabin, ay-ay-ay... ﻿"Most of my attention was focused on the question: ﻿"When will the government decide that diplomatic attempts have proven fruitless ﻿"and that war is inevitable and will order the IDF to attack? ﻿"On May 22nd I felt a need to have a word with Ben Gurion. ﻿"Ben Gurion made me miserable. ﻿"'We find ourselves,' he said, 'in dire straits. ﻿'"I have great doubts whether Nasser wanted war at all. ﻿'"You made a mistake ﻿'"and whoever authorized you to call up the reserves troops ﻿'"made a mistake.

General Yitzhak Rabin appeared before the Israeli and world press and said, among other things: ﻿We are fighting on a number of fronts. ﻿The battles are grueling. ﻿Considering the nature of the combat, the direction it's,taking, our achievements, ﻿the number of losses, if I may say so, ﻿isn't great. ﻿Battalion commanders, ﻿we're on the ridge overlooking the Old City ﻿and we're about to go in. ﻿Move in, towards the gate! ﻿Roger. Well done. ﻿Hold your fire! All units, hold your fire! ﻿I'm now experiencing a feeling that I doubt I can fully express ﻿its significance in words. i fought in the War of Independence in Jerusalem ﻿and entering the Old City through the Lion's Gate today ﻿with the Defense Minister represents for me ﻿perhaps the greatest change ﻿that has occurred in the past 55 hours. ﻿...Am I not a harp for all your songs ﻿am a violin ﻿Jerusalem of gold... ﻿Soldiers of the IDF, ﻿with this ceasefire ends the war of the Children of Light ﻿against those who tried to bring darkness upon us. ﻿The Israel Defense Force! ﻿Rabin, The Israel Defense Force! ﻿El, El, El, Israel! ﻿Lt. General Yitzhak Rabin. ﻿And now it's my honor to call up Doctor... ﻿Yitzhak Rabin to speak. ﻿I stand in awe before you, teachers of this generation, ﻿in this glorious ancient spot overlooking our eternal capital. The question to be asked is, ﻿why would the University award an honorary PhD in Philosophy ﻿to a soldier in recgnition of his acts in war? ﻿What do military men have to do with the world of academia, ﻿which symbolizes culture? ﻿What do those whose job is violence have to do with values of the spirit? ﻿I see this honor as your profound recognition of the uniqueness of the IDF ﻿which in turn reflects the uniqueness of the Jewish people as a whole. ﻿The IDF soldier has been discovered in his courage and determination ﻿and no man can help but stand in awe of this incredible human phenomenon. ﻿Perhaps the Jewish people was never taught nor became accustomed ﻿to feeling the joy of the conqueror and the victor, ﻿so victory was met with mixed feelings. ﻿I spoke to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Levi Eshkol ﻿and said: When I retire from this post I'd like to be an ambassador. ﻿Eshkol grabbed his chair and said: Hold me, ﻿I'm about to fall out of my chair. ﻿You, a diplomat?! ﻿Are you the type for diplomatic cocktail parties?! ﻿Lt. General Rabin, how does the former Chief of Staff and future ambassador feel? ﻿At this point he feels very good ﻿because he doesn't have the obligations of the past ﻿and he doesn't yet have the obligations of the future. ﻿"I came to the leader of the free world to place Israel's security in its hands ﻿"and I find it falling apart." ﻿"The Vietcong attack in North Vietnam has left its depressing mark ﻿"on the 1968 elections. ﻿"The superpower fell victim to an acute sense of loss of faith in its strength, ﻿"and in the moral fiber of its leaders. ﻿"I could understand why the Americans in their perplexity ﻿"ask for help from the man who commanded the tiny Israeli army ﻿"of June 1967. ﻿"Two things I know are true of every war: ﻿"War cannot be won without defining for the military echelon ﻿"precisely and clearly what its goal is and what is expected of the army. ﻿"What are the USA's expectations in Vietnam? ﻿"What would you consider a victory? ﻿'"We must destroy the human potential of the Vietcong. ﻿'"There is no other way.' That was the answer I received. ﻿"I answered: If that's how you perceive the way to victory, ﻿"you'll lose the war in Vietnam. ﻿"You can't undermine the fighting strength and willingness to fight ﻿"of a nation of tens of millions who passionately believe in their goal. ﻿"While the USA is busy with its internal struggles ﻿"is no time to try to bring peace to the Middle East." ﻿"Greetings, Golda Meir" ﻿A few minutes ago we spoke with ﻿the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Mr. Yitzhak Rabin. ﻿The subject: The last speech by American Secretary of State William Rogers. ﻿The American approach this time, more than usual, emphasized ﻿the need to exchange land for peace. ﻿The question was put to Israel more adamantly: ﻿Is peace still Israel's highest priority ﻿and is it willing to give up most of the territories for peace? ﻿The American point of departure ﻿is that we must obtain a peace treaty. ﻿The Americans have never recognized our right ﻿to significantly increase Israel's territory. ﻿This has been their policy since the end of the Six Day War. ﻿"Golda: If we accept the U.S. proposal it will be suicide and a betrayal of our people" ﻿Rabin: "No pressure or ultimatum" ﻿What kinds of pressure are they liable to apply ﻿should there be a disagreement between Israel and the U.S. ﻿regarding the proposed treaty? ﻿It is possible that the U.S. will try to persuade us through various means ﻿to agree to the solution. ﻿Mr. Rabin, was your report to the government pessimistic or optimistic? ﻿How would you describe it? ﻿I hope it was factual. ﻿"Washington, July 25th, 1970. ﻿"Greetings, Leah. ﻿"I have much work to do here ﻿"Especially since Egypt agreed to the American proposal. ﻿"The fact that Egypt agreed to it creates quite a few problems for us. ﻿"By accepting the American proposal, ﻿"the Egyptians are admitting de facto ﻿"that the aim of the talks is peace between Israel and Egypt. ﻿"If it's also true that Syria accepted the proposal ﻿"our situation in terms of advocacy; will be very difficult. ﻿"Until now, Israel could proudly claim ﻿'that we want peace but the Arabs don't. ﻿"Now it will be very difficult ﻿"if the Israeli government decides to continue not to decide. ﻿"I think Golda understands the situation. ﻿"Moshe Dayan is a national disaster and the same goes for our ministers. ﻿"This puts me in a tough situation. ﻿"I ean't really answer any questions. . ﻿"All the TV channels want to interview me and I refuse. ﻿There are rumors that our ambassador in Washington... ﻿There are still rumors? ﻿There are rumors again. ﻿They started up again a week ago. ﻿That he'll stop being our ambassador in Washington ﻿and will be "promoted" to the Israeli government. ﻿Do you know anything about these rumors? ﻿Not a thing. -Not a thing. ﻿To be precise, read about them in the paper. ﻿That was the only way I got this information. ﻿Did you smile when you read them? ﻿And hew. -You smiled. That means ﻿you don't think it's possible. ﻿I think it makes most sense that I stay in the U.S. ﻿Well, I don't believe that my government has taken a clear position, ﻿We gather there is a sense of relief that the shooting has stopped, ﻿at least on one front. ﻿Well, I believe that there are mixed feelings, ﻿first, everybody is happy that the shooting has been stopped, ﻿but people have to think a little bit forward ﻿to see what will be the real outcome of the limited ceasefire. ﻿"My sister Rachel called to say that Father's situation is very grave. ﻿"I left for Israel immediately; ﻿"but while'waiting for my flight at Kennedy Airport ﻿'"the news of his death arrived. ﻿It was very painful that I hadn't had the chance to say goodbye. "As he wished, he was buried in Manara, where he lived out his last years." ﻿"His faith in the simplicity of life and in providing an example of the simple life ﻿"remained in him to his dying day. ﻿"a generation whose values differ from those common today. ﻿In any case, you're about to join Israel's political life. ﻿Are there fundamental things that you'd like to change ﻿in terms of policy and defense? -I'll answer that ﻿when I'm not wearing the uniform of a government employee. ﻿What are your plans for the next few months? ﻿First of all, to return home. ﻿And then? ﻿To stay home. ﻿"Hello, Leah. ﻿"I'm writing this letter; after Yuval and I ﻿"ate our last lunch together ﻿"in Washington before he returns to Israel. ﻿"Everything seems a bit strange. ﻿"The family is starting to move back to Israel. ﻿"We just finished packing everything according to your instructions ﻿and I went back to the office. ﻿"All in all, i's a bit sad.

'Come along.' ﻿"I said to myself: Here goes nothing." ﻿Would you say that after 100 days ﻿as Prime Minister and after your trip to Washington ﻿you can give the public a clearer idea ﻿of what to expect in the near future? ﻿If there were a realistic possibility of achieving true peace ﻿with one or more Arab states, I would be in favor. ﻿In favor of compromise, perhaps even far-reaching compromise. ﻿On the other hand there is another option, ﻿the option of progressing in stages. ﻿"Kissinger expected to bring Egyptian proposals to Jerusalem" ﻿Egyptian and Israeli Positions can be bridged" ﻿You know, Kissinger spoke to me in 73. ﻿He said: The Egyptians have a legitimate claim to sovereignty over every inch. ﻿You have a legitimate claim to security. ﻿Why won't you withdraw to the '67 borders for the sake of peace with Egypt? ﻿If the issue were peace with Egypt alone, ﻿they could get something close to the '67 borders. ﻿I'd be willing to go very far. ﻿All I had to say was '"67." ﻿But that's completely off the record. ﻿He doesn't want to talk to me. ﻿He talks to us by way of television and radio. ﻿I'll present my question to him as follows: ﻿If you truly want peace, make a real move and let's meet ﻿and let the goal of the meeting, the goal of the dialogue, ﻿be peace between Egypt and Israel. ﻿If you, President Sadat, are willing to do that, ﻿I'm willing to do it any place, any time. ﻿Is this a way to move toward peace? ﻿We'll expose ourselves to inestimable dangers. ﻿How does Dr. Kissinger put it? "One step at a time." ﻿"One withdrawal at a time." ﻿"Rabin! You aren't bringing peace, you're bringing war" ﻿"Rabin, it's not too late to stop the diplomatic backslide" ﻿The opinion expressed by some 10,000 people ﻿taking part in this great demonstration ﻿against the withdrawal from certain parts of Sinai is: ﻿Either let the Jews settle all over Israel, ﻿or we'll settle in ourselves. ﻿The danger I see here is in some of the statements of the extremist chauvinism. ﻿That "all belongs to us." ﻿That Abou Redis is already ours. ﻿And "Sharm el-Sheikh, we have returned to you." We've turned the borders issue into a moral issue, not a means. ﻿And in fact, to get a long-term solution ﻿the challenge is expunging the enmity and motivation for the conflict. ﻿"Kissinger arrives with Egyptian agreement to our stands" ﻿This time, the interim agreement ﻿isn't about a ceasefire, ﻿it's about changing the relations between Egypt and Israel. ﻿And all future disagreements ﻿will have to be solved through negotiations and peaceful means. ﻿I hope that realizing the difficulties of the shuttle diplomacy, ﻿in the future you'll encourage direct negotiations. ﻿And it will save you a lot of effort and a lot of time. Thank you very much. ﻿Pardon me for dramatizing, but... ﻿We're worried this may develop into a blood spill. ﻿I see Gush Emunim ﻿as one of the gravest dangers to the State of Israel. ﻿And as long as they can't distinguish between legitimate debate ﻿over the settlement policy or any other issue, ﻿these people bring disaster upon Israel. ﻿You can see what they're doing. ﻿What'is settlement, anyway? What'kind of struggle is that? ﻿Kadum is a lot of hot air. ﻿Tear off his clothes! ﻿Gush Emunim is not a settlement movement, ﻿it is a cancer in the democratic tissue of the State of Israel. ﻿It is an entity that takes the law into its own hands. ﻿And such an entity must not be allowed to exist. ﻿From a historical perspective, ﻿people will think: Israel's main concern in 1976 ﻿was some shitty, meaningless place, ﻿a mystical issue that Israel's existence supposedly depended on. ﻿Unbelievable. ﻿I said that but please don't use it. ﻿It would be politically insane to say that. ﻿I'm not guaranteeing that it won't come to evacuation ﻿because of the populace and I don't think it's possible ﻿to exist in the long term, if we don't want a state of Apartheid, ﻿with a million and a half Arabs in a Jewish state ﻿whose birth rate will always be higher. ﻿I'm willing to go to elections over that. ﻿I'm glad to have this opportunity to meet with ﻿Arab and Jewish students living in both parts of Nazareth. ﻿Why does the Israeli government refuse to negotiate with the PLO ﻿even though the U.N. recognizes it ﻿as the exclusive representative of the Palestinian people ﻿which is a key element in the Arab-Israeli conflict? ﻿Israel will not negotiate with an organization that has defined as its goal ﻿the destruction of the State of Israel. ﻿That is why Israel will not negotiate with them. ﻿"The Prime Minister's wife has an account at the National Bank in Washington" ﻿The accounts were opened when we were living in Washington ﻿when I served as Israeli ambassador to the U.S. ﻿We didn't hide the fact that we had accounts there ﻿and the proof is that the last time we were in the U.S. ﻿my wife drove in an American Department of State vehicle, ﻿with bodyguards, to the bank. ﻿If we'd thought we should hide it we certainly wouldn't have done it that way. ﻿When we left the U.S. in 73 ﻿we had a balance of $18,000 ﻿and we made the mistake and oversight of not closing the account ﻿in accordance with the law when I left the position. ﻿We share the responsibility, formally and ethically. ﻿I will not allow only my wife to be put on trial ﻿if that in fact is the decision. ﻿If that is the decision I will stand with her ﻿and not hide behind the immunity of a Knesset member. ﻿Do you think this affair ﻿marks the end of your public career or your active participation, ﻿in Israeli's political life? ﻿I certainly hope not. ﻿"Rabin will go on vacation Peres will replace him" ﻿"Peres - into the-sea Begin - into the government" ﻿"Peres supports ithe PLO" "Likud in first place, crushing defeat for the Labor Party" ﻿I'm very happy to welcome Mr. Begin ﻿and to begin discussions regarding the transfer of government. ﻿I want to thank the Prime Minister for our important discussion: ﻿The Prime Minister gave me important information today, ﻿mainly diplomatic. ﻿"The psychological impact of Sadat's visit was enormous. ﻿"When I met President Sadat at the airport ﻿"we didn't have time for anything but a pleasant exchange. ﻿"One day historians will tell the true story ﻿"and will have no problem discovering that the very policy ﻿"that I formulated back in late 1974 when I was prime minister ﻿"came to fruition beyond expectations. ﻿"It's harder to calculate the psychological and social impact of peace. ﻿"The physical threat from without was the strongest factor that united us. "Now we live in a time of both peace and war. ﻿"The inception of peace marks the end of the heroic era of Zionism. ﻿"The future will not be symbolized by both the pioneer and the soldier. ﻿"Peace entails dangers. ﻿"I have no doubt that the risks of peace are a thousand times preferable ﻿"to the bitter certainty of war." ﻿"Confrontations in Judea and Samaria, hundreds of thousands detained" "Rabin: We'll impose order even if it hurts" ﻿It's up to them. ﻿I don't believe that any resident of the occupied territories ﻿feels he can say: ﻿"I am the Israelis' partner in a treaty" out of fear for his life, ﻿which is why they all claim that without external backing ﻿they can't do so. ﻿Some of them want to rely on the PLO. ﻿We will not negotiate with the PLO. ﻿Some of them rely on Jordan. ﻿When Jordan is willing, we're willing to negotiate. ﻿In the meantime, Jordan isn't willing. ﻿For their sake, for our sake, ﻿law and order must be restored. ﻿Let's go, let's go! ﻿Rabin, Yitzhak? ﻿You haven't exchanged your ID, Mr. Prime Minister. ﻿Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, excuse me... ﻿One, another one, and down it goes. ﻿And now, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the television poll. ﻿Looks good. ﻿Israel is waiting for Rabin ﻿There's a national consensus ﻿Rabin, King of Israel, lives on ﻿Give us a smile ﻿There is no responsibility unless authority is bestowed on he who takes responsibility ﻿and therefore I will navigate. ﻿I was prime minister for three years already. ﻿I was defense minister for five and a half years in the national unity government. ﻿l didn't join the government to sit around. ﻿At this point one thing concerns me: ﻿How to create a new situation ﻿between us and the Palestinians in the occupied territories. ﻿Currently both sides have terrible scars. ﻿How do we overcome these scars and create peaceful coexistence? ﻿What are you building here? We're paving the Abd el-Aziz Road ﻿We're willing to work for even 10 shekels a day ﻿to feed our families. ﻿You know what 10 shekels is? A pack of cigarettes. ﻿If you smoke two packs a day ﻿you're only working for cigarettes. ﻿They want peace and so do we. ﻿He should tell his delegation. ﻿Peace. -Peace. -Peace.-Peace. ﻿"Gesture to Palestinians 182 prisoners released" ﻿I understand people's pain and concern. ﻿We've been through much harder times. ﻿I believe that with the path we're taking, with the means we're using, ﻿we will win the war against terrorism. ﻿I said and I won't deny it ﻿that indeed the last month was a very tough month. ﻿The question is what to do. ﻿Closing the border until further notice will reduce friction ﻿between most of the Israeli populace ﻿and the Palestinian residents who worked in Israel ﻿who were a main source of concern. ﻿First we must prevent the recurrence of knifings ﻿in Bat-Yam, on HaAliyah St. in Tel Aviv, in Rehovot ﻿and everywhere else. ﻿Here in sovereign Israel are concentrated most of the 4 million Israelis. ﻿There's ho hermetic solution to prevent every terror attack ﻿but to reduce the level of terrorism, ﻿to open the door to negotiations ﻿where the solution to the conflict lies. ﻿"You! You! You! Are guilty!" ﻿We don't want dead bodies we want soldiers ﻿"Rabin, it's your fault! 163 killed" ﻿I play doubles ﻿which requires a partner. ﻿I've reach the age where it's not a good idea to play singles, ﻿it's too much of a physical effort. ﻿Are you competitive? ﻿Would I have this job otherwise? ﻿Shimon Peres and I are full partners on the road to peace. We've had our differences in the past, with which you're all familiar, ﻿but our ability to overcome those differences ﻿for the sake of goals that we both believe in ﻿I think this is rare in poltics ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. ﻿In about three hours, in Jerusalem, Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin will sign ﻿the treaty for mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel ﻿while at the same time in Tunisia, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will sign the treaty. ﻿The Norwegian Foreign Minister will bring the treaties from Tunisia to Jerusalem. ﻿Fora long time I believed ﻿that the Palestinian residents of the occupied territories alone ﻿could stand up ﻿and fulfill its potential. ﻿After over a year of negotiations ﻿I came to the conclusion that they aren't capable. ﻿They didn't come to Madrid without a decision in Tunisia, ﻿they didn't act without faxes and phone calls from Tunisia. ﻿It's sad to say, but it's a fact. ﻿Whoever wants to ignore the facts is welcome to. ﻿Whoever wants to promote peace and the beginning of a solution ﻿can't ignore them. ﻿And the PLO police force, the PLO terrorists, ﻿the PLO security forces, will take over the posts that the IDF abandons. ﻿That's what'll happen in Jericho. ﻿Mr. Chairman, we will use every legitimate means, I repeat, legitimate, ﻿at the disposal of an opposition party in a democratic state ﻿to stop this foolish process that endangers Israel's very’future. ﻿Mr. Netanyahu said "legitimate means". ﻿I made a difficult decision. ﻿It was hard for me to grasp it. ﻿I believe it was hard for many citizens to grasp. ﻿But if we ever want to give the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli problem ﻿a serious chance, ﻿today is the day and the PLO is the partner ﻿which has divested itself of the things I despised. ﻿I'm sure this is hard for the families of those who were slaughtered, murdered, ﻿by the murderous PLO. ﻿We must not forget that. ﻿If we can't get our heads around the fact ﻿that peace is made with enemies, sometimes very cruel enemies, ﻿after all, it's easy to make peace with friends. ﻿When the Jewish people decided ﻿that the Jewish State would be established here in Israel ﻿it also decided who our neighbors would be, ﻿the Arab states and nations, including the Palestinians. ﻿And there are two ways to live here, ﻿either in peace or in a state of "Shall the sword forever devour?" ﻿I want to take this chance for peace. ﻿I see nothing wrong with meeting with Arafat. ﻿I made a move which is manifest in today's signing. ﻿Rabin the traitor! ﻿I've noticed that when people call you a traitor ﻿it upsets you. ﻿To a certain degree, yes, at first. Not as much now. ﻿Sometimes I think that their extremism is so absurd ﻿that I've simply accepted the fact that some people are crazy ﻿and they don't even understand what the word "traitor" means, ﻿that someone sticks it in their mouths and they repeat it. ﻿What is a traitor? ﻿Did I betray anything? ﻿"Aftershock of Hebron Massacre - Riots in Jaffa and the Territories" ﻿The Murderer ﻿On behalf of myself and the government ﻿we express our grief and wish to pass on our sincere condolences ﻿to the families of the murder victims and the Palestinian people. ﻿Insane acts by psychopaths ﻿will not prevent peace and reconciliation ﻿between the citizens of Israel and the Palestinian people. ﻿As Defense Minister I feel responsible. ﻿one political, psychological madman ﻿could do this is serious. ﻿But it could happen again tomorrow somewhere else. ﻿And I don't want to give examples lest it give someone ﻿the idea to do ﻿The enemies of peace are Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, ﻿the Palestinian resistance fronts ﻿that murder Jews in order to draw a response from Israel, ﻿in order to create an atmosphere of resistance to the peace process. ﻿At the same time there are Israeli resistors ﻿who don't hesitate to call me a traitor. ﻿Yesterday in Or Akiva there was a printed slogan: ﻿"Rabin should be killed." ﻿"Rabin should be killed" ﻿I decided to talk to the PLO ﻿so we have to take that road all the way. ﻿The Liar ﻿"Rabin buries Zionism" ﻿Israel is in danger ﻿I think it was a grave mistake ﻿to build settlements intensely populated areas. ﻿These settlements have no purpose ﻿but to undermine any chance of a diplomatic solution. ﻿I went on a tour yesterday ﻿of two settlements, I won't mention their names, ﻿of 30 families each. ﻿Ensuring their security on the roads and at home ﻿costs $250,000 per family. ﻿Was it a good flight? ﻿Very good. Short one. -Short one. ﻿It's not late to leave the airport. -Yeah. ﻿Last Saturday CNN came to photo me at the tennis court. ﻿I hope they took a good shots I ﻿now see ﻿in my position at this time ﻿a historic opportunity to realize a movement in a certain direction. ﻿A movement in a direction that was unthinkable in the-past. ﻿I've done things to ensure that the mark of this government ﻿will remain engraved on the future situation of the Middle; Bast. ﻿We'll be going over to Oslo in a few seconds ﻿for the announcement of the prize winners. ﻿Here's the announcement: ﻿There are three winners, ﻿Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, in that order. ﻿Rabin is last. ﻿He announced them in alphabetical order. ﻿We don't have to like each other to achieve coexistence in peace. ﻿We've determined Arafat, the PLO, to be our partner in reconciliation ﻿and in the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. ﻿People ask me: Have you brought peace or terrorism? ﻿The road to peace is not'easy. ﻿There is no other alternative. ﻿"Peace is murdering us" ﻿"Peace at knifepoint" "Rabin, when will your friend send the murderer home?" ﻿You're now 72 and a half. ﻿No, I'm 73 and a half. ﻿You're 73 and a half? -On the first of March next year ﻿I'll be 74. I don’t pretend to be younger. ﻿I know a lot of young people who seem old to me ﻿and I know a few older people who are still young. ﻿My first priority is the peace process. ﻿Do you really see a prime minister in front of you? I see myself. ﻿Can you step aside and look at yourself from the side and say: ﻿"I really am Prime Minister"? ﻿First of all, it's a fact. ﻿I already was... This is my second time. ﻿You get used to it. ﻿President Clinton, King Hussein, President Mubarak, ﻿Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat. ﻿Death to Rabin! ﻿Death to Rabin! ﻿Rabin the traitor! ﻿Death to Rabin! ﻿We'll get rid of Rabin with blood and fire! ﻿If they think I'm a traitor and a murderer, ﻿or there are those among them who think so, I have no basis for dialogue with them. ﻿You're offended. -I'm not offended. ﻿I say that if someone thinks so, I have the right to ignore him, ﻿not ignore the responsibility for his security or for his welfare ﻿because I'm everyone's prime minister. ﻿But a basis for love with them? ﻿A basis for understanding with them? ﻿What right do they have even to think ﻿that they can expect that of me ﻿if I am what they think I am? ﻿This is the emblem, people managed to remove the emblem from the car, ﻿the emblem is a sign it signifies that as we got to it ﻿we can get to Rabin. ﻿In case you have any doubts, ﻿I'm going to implement what I believe, in the peace process ﻿with the Palestinians and the Syrians. ﻿How does it feel to have policemen and bodyguards ﻿separating you from the public? ﻿Last night I had a pleasant surprise ﻿at the Film Academy awards. ﻿I was given a very nice reception. ﻿Just a minute. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Sir, this is for you. ﻿Let me speak. ﻿I think that life in Israel is sometimes bigger ﻿than the movies. Sorry. ﻿I had many roles, but I'm not an actor ﻿apologize, I have to go. ﻿Some American is waiting for my report. ﻿So thank you very much. ﻿"A strong nation makes peace"
