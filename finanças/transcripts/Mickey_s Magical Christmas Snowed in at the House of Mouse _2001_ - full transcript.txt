Well, everybody, that's our show. Thanks for spending Christmas Eve at the House of Mouse. Here's wishing everybody a merry Christmas and a safe trip ho-ho-home. Boy. What a great show. Mickey, it was just wonderful. And now we can all celebrate our own Christmas at home. But we can't go home. - We're snowed in. - Well, this is a fine predicament. Aw, it can't be that bad. Aw, no. - Did you hear, Belle? We can't go home. - We can always build a home. l'm sure Mickey will think of something. l thought of something. We can have our own Christmas party right here. That's a wonderful idea. Aw, humbug. Humbug? What's wrong, Donald? Once again he just doesn't have the Christmas spirit. We'll see about that. Hot cocoa and cookies comin' through. Now this Christmas party is really starting to warm up. - Hey, Mickey, look what l found. - Oh, boy. A box of our all-time favourite Christmas stories. - Humbug. - Bug? We'll have what he's having. Timon, l think that ''humbug'' is something that you say when you don't have any Christmas spirit. Come on, Donald. This'll get you into the spirit of the season. lt's a story about you. - Snowman contest? - Today? We're gonna win. Oh, boy. We're gonna win for sure. Wait. We're not done yet. Oh, boy. Nothing beats a day of ice-skating. Aw, nuts. lt works. Hey. Why, l oughta... Aw, phooey. Hey, look. lt's Mickey Mouse. Whew. Safe at last. What...? Hello. We have a winner. And here is your prize. - Did seein' that help your Christmas spirit? - Oh, humbug. l have an idea what might help. Hearing some yuletide wishes. Good idea, Minnie, cos earlier today l went out on the street to see what everybody wanted. - What would you like for Christmas? - That's easy. My two front teeth. Already got those. The lamp. Get me the lamp. What do we want for Christmas? How about bunk beds? No strings to hold me down. - Bugs, grubs, worms and beetles. - And air freshener. Your voice will do nicely. l wish l wasn't a dumb old llama any more. What do l wish for Christmas, Mickey? l wish that everyone will find their inner beauty. - You know, you're all l wish for, Minnie. - Aw, Mickey, that's sweet. Now what do you say we keep the party going with Professor Ludwig Von Drake and ''The Science of Santa''. Today the professor is going to explain how Santa can fly all over the world in only one cute little night. lf there was milk and cookies there waiting for me l'd be flyin' all over the place myself. Ludwig. Have you been in the cookie jar again? Not now, Mommy. l'm doing my little science demonstration. What was l talking about? Oh, yes. Santa Claus is getting everywhere so fast because he is driving this turbo-charged Santa sleigh with dual toy bags. This buggy goes so fast that Santa can be in more than one place at the same time. Hello there. Look what l brought for me - the cookie jar. - Ludwig. - Quick. Step on it. OK, admit it. Hearing all about Santa had to help put you in the Christmas spirit. - Right, Donald? - Nothing seems to be working. Even my trusted pup Pluto wants to help out. Well, then, what do you say we show a story about Pluto? How about the one where Pluto and l pick out our Christmas tree together? OK, Pluto. Let's get our tree. Hey, get a load of that. - He'll never find us. - You're telling me. - What was that? - l don't know. Oh, boy. OK, Pluto. All right? Come on. Let's go. Hey, wake up. Well, what do you know? Well, Pluto, that's it. Hey. Cut it out. There. ls that better? Oh, Pluto. OK, l'll light the candles. There. Thank you. Let's go. Pluto. Get out of there. What do you think you're... Hey, cut it out. Hey, watch out. You dumb mutt. Now look what you've done to our... Pluto. We've got chipmunks in our tree. Cute little fellows. Pluto. After all, it is Christmas. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la-la, la, la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la-la, la, la Don we now our gay apparel Fa-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la Troll the ancient yuletide carol Gee, that was swell. lsn't it nice seeing everybody get along? Donald, l wish you'd have the Christmas spirit. You have so much to be thankful for. - Uh-huh. Like l'm thankful for Mickey. - And l'm thankful for my new hat. Say, what's everybody else thankful for? l'm thankful for friendly mice who make nice evening wear. l'm thankful for laughter, joy, and the high-spirited glee that fills my heart to overflowing. All right, all right, people. Listen up. Mushu's on stage now, so pay attention. Time to give thanks for the important stuff. l'd like to thank the Guardian Spirits. Yeah, you guys, l love ya. And Mulan for makin' me a great big movie star. All right, all right. Hold your horseflies. l see ya. l'm thankful for the ''little people'' too. But we don't even know him. The one thing l'm thankful for most is my hat. All hats, in fact, if you can believe that. Hats that are tall, and hats that are small, and hats that are totally off of the wall. Hats that are solely for use by Stromboli, and hats which are made up of giant broccoli. l'm grateful for hats of all shapes and all sizes, but l love my hat best cos it's full of surprises. There now, Donald. You see? There's lots of reasons to have the Christmas spirit. Aw, l don't know. Now, why don't you take a look at how l decorated my house today? Jingle those bells, boys. Mickey. Look. Aw. The Nutcracker. Why, even Donald's gonna love that. Now here's a Christmas story with a new twist. And it was made all the sweeter because of my Mickey. Gosh. lt is December 24th, Christmas Eve. Young Maria has been waiting all day for this moment. lt's so beautiful. Christmas is here. Everything shone and glittered in the loveliest manner. Who - oh, who - could describe them all? l can. Now, this here is a nice little dolly. And here's a kooky cuckoo clock. And look. lt's a choo-choo train. Excuse me. l am trying to narrate. Well, you said you wanted someone to describe all of this stuff here. That was a rhetorical question. Pretend like l'm not here. How do you expect me to ignore a big, booming voice - that's blabbedy-blabbering all the time? - Just ignore me. All right, have it your way. Somebody could use a little istmas-Chray irit-spay. This year, Godpapa Drosselmeier had made a special gift for young Maria. All right, little one. Now, this took me all... lt had taken him all year to build. Right. All year. - lt's a beautiful... - A beautiful nutcracker doll. Aw, you're no narrator. You're just a great big surprise-spoiler. - lgnore me and just give her the doll. - Fine, fine. All right. Here's the no-longer-a-surprise nutcracker. Take it already. He's so handsome. Thank you. You know, l have been taking care of myself. l've been doing some jogging and weightlifting and... You're talking about the doll. Yeah, he's cute too. l just love it. Thank you, Godpapa Drosselmeier. Wait a minute. He's not supposed to dance. Must be a loose cogwheel in here somewhere. You broke him. Right. Just for that, l'm kicking you out of the story. l'll take the greatest care of you and nurse you till you're quite better and happy again. There. Just as handsome as ever. lf only you were real, l could dance with you. Maria thought she saw the Nutcracker smile. Perhaps it was a trick of the light, perhaps something else. Maria, l want to thank you for your kindness. Maria was no longer frightened. ln the twinkling of the Christmas lights, her beloved Nutcracker looked more handsome and dashing than ever. Suddenly there began a sort of wild kickering and squeaking, loudly and all about. My God. lt's... lt's... the Mouse King. l don't wanna be the Mouse King. This is ridiculous. Bye-bye. Wait. Donald. You know the Mouse King wins. - He does? - Yes, yes. The Mouse King wins in the end. You get the girl. Oh boy, oh boy. l'll do it. The Mouse King - who will win in the end - had come for Maria. He wanted her to be his queen. Don't worry. l'll protect you. Oh, no. Something screwy going on here. - Heya, Mickey. - Goofy. What are you doing here? - You're not in The Nutcracker. - l am now. - But what are you supposed to be? - l be helpin' ya. No, no. What role are you playing? Hamlet? - Can l get a little help here? - Nope. l'm staying out of this one. Goofy, what role are you playing from The Nutcracker?. Right. l'll be the Magical Snow Fairy who can instantly transport you to the evil Mouse King's hidden kingdom. Now you're talking. Let's go. Right. Here we go. The Mouse King, played by Donald Duck - and who will win in the end - was attempting to crown Minnie - l mean Maria - as his duck - mouse - queen, or something like that. - Hold still, will you? - No. Never. You heard the little lady. Let her go, you mousey monarch. My Nutcracker. And so they made their escape, except for Goofy - l mean, the Magical Snow Fairy, who was captured by... Donald? No. No, the Mouse King. You get the idea. Arriving safely at home, the Nutcracker and Maria sought to close the way to the Mouse King's world. But they'd forgotten about the train. Donald the Mouse King was stopped by Mickey the Nutcracker and trapped in his own sceptre. You said l would win. Sorry. l made a mistake. l got card games. Oh, no. Go on, Donald. Pick a card. Any card. And so Minnie - l mean Maria - and her handsome Nutcracker, played by Mickey, lived happily ever... - Thank you for getting this back to me. - l thought you were gone. Oh, no. l just needed to get my sceptre back. - Your sceptre? - Yes. This little fellow in here usurped me. Now that l got it back, l can resume my royal duties as the King of the Sugar Plum Fairies. Now, really. You are not the King of the Sugar Plum Fairies. l sure am. Come on, little guys, let's go. And that, my dear friends, ends the tale of the Nutcracker and Goofy and the Duck King of the Mice and... l have no idea what that Sugar Plum Fairy nonsense had to do with any of it. l'm outta here. This is turning out to be a wonderful Christmas. We finished our house. l knew Mickey wouldn't let us down. lt's good to see that a merry Christmas is being had by all. So, Donald, you feelin' jolly yet? l say humbug. l did everything l could think of. l guess Donald's just never gonna have the Christmas spirit. Why so glum, Mickey? Well, l wanted to throw a party and make it a merry Christmas for everybody, but my good pal Donald's missing out. Now, Mickey, the Christmas spirit doesn't come from a party. lt comes from sharing the holidays with family and friends. And it seems to me that Donald has the best friend anyone could want - in you. Gee, l guess you're right. And all l wish is for everyone to have a merry Christmas, even that humbug Donald. Well, haven't you ever wished upon a star? Your dreams just might come true. Gosh. l wish that, home or away, with family or friends, whether you've got the fanciest decorations or the humblest little tree, that... that everyone could have the Christmas spirit. Gosh. - Say, Donald... - What do you want? Well, l want my best friend to put the star on the tree. You want me to do it? Aw, you bet l do. Merry Christmas. lt's magical. Pretty. That old star never lets you down. Now, before we sing our Christmas carol, l wanna share one of my favourite Christmas stories with Donald and all my friends. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to one and all. Give a penny for the poor, governor? Penny for the poor? My partner Jacob Marley. Dead seven years today. He was a good 'un. He robbed from the widows and swindled the poor. ln his will he left me enough money to pay for his tombstone. And l had him buried at sea. Good morning, Mr Scrooge. Cratchit. What are you doing with that piece of coal? l was... just trying to thaw out the ink. You used a piece last week. Now, get on with your work, Cratchit. Speaking of work, Mr Scrooge, tomorrow is Christmas, and l was wondering if l could have half a day off? Christmas, eh? Well... l suppose so, but l'll dock you half a day's pay. Now, let's see. l pay you two shillings a day... Two shillings and a ha'penny, sir. Oh, yes. l gave you that raise three years ago. Yes, sir. When l started doing your laundry. All right, Cratchit. Get busy while l go over my books. And here. Here's another bundle of shirts for you. Yes, sir. Let's see, now. 50 pounds, ten shillings from McDuff. Plus his 80% interest, compounded daily. Money, money, money. Merry Christmas. And a merry Christmas to you, Master Fred. Bah, humbug. Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge. What's so merry about it? l'll tell you what Christmas is: it's just another work day, and any jackanapes who thinks else should be boiled in his own pudding. But, sir, Christmas is a time for giving. A time to be with one's family. l say ''Bah, humbug.'' l don't care. l say ''Merry Christmas.'' Merry Christmas. Well said, Master Fred. Cratchit. What are you doing? l was just trying to keep my hands warm, sir. And what are you doing here, nephew? l've come to give you a wreath and invite you to Christmas dinner. Well. l suppose you're going to have plump goose with chestnut dressing? - Yeah. - And plum pudding and lemon sauce? Yeah. Boy, oh, boy. And candied fruits with spiced sugar cakes? Yeah. Will you come? Are you daft, man? You know l can't eat that stuff. Here's your wreath back. Now out, out, out. Bah. Humbug. Merry Christmas. And a ''bah, humbug'' to you. That Fred. Always so full of kindness. Aye, he always was a little peculiar. And stubborn. Customers. l'll handle this, Cratchit. Yes, what can l do for you two gentlemen? Sir, we are soliciting funds for the indigent and destitute. For the what? We're collecting for the poor. Well, you realise if you give money to the poor, - they won't be poor any more, will they? - Well... And if they're not poor any more, then you won't have to raise money for them any more. Well, l suppose... And if you don't have to raise money for them any more, then you would be out of a job. Please, gentlemen, don't ask me to put you out of a job. - Not on Christmas Eve. - We wouldn't do that, Mr Scrooge. Well, then, l suggest you give this to the poor and be gone. What's this world coming to, Cratchit? You work all your life to get money, and people want you to give it away. Two minutes fast. Well, never mind those two minutes. You may go now. Thank you, sir. You're so kind. Never mind the mushy stuff. Just go. But be here all the earlier the next day. l will. l will, sir. And a ''bah, humbug...'' l mean, a merry Christmas to you, sir. Scrooge. Jacob Marley? No, that can't be. Gosh. Ebenezer Scrooge. Go away. Ebenezer Scrooge... Gosh. Kind of slippery. Scrooge, don't you recognise me? l was your partner, Jacob Marley. Marley. lt is you. Ebenezer, remember when l was alive l robbed the widows and swindled the poor? Yes, and all in the same day. You had class, Jacob. Yep. No. No. l was wrong. And so, as punishment, l'm forced to carry these heavy chains through eternity. Maybe even longer. There's no hope. l'm doomed. Doomed. And the same thing will happen to you, Ebenezer Scrooge. No. No, it can't. lt mustn't. Help me, Jacob. Tonight you will be visited by three spirits. Listen to them. Do what they say. Or your chains will be heavier than mine. Farewell, Ebenezer. Farewell... Marley. Watch out for that first step. Spirits. Humbug. What, what, what? What...? Well. lt's about time. Haven't got all night, you know. Who... Who are you? Why, l'm the Ghost of Christmas Past. l thought you'd be taller. Listen, Scrooge, if men were measured by kindness, you'd be no bigger than a speck of dust. Kindness is of little use in this world. You didn't always think so. - Come on, Scrooge, it's time to go. - Then go. Spirit. What... what are you doing? We're gonna visit your past. l'm not going out there. l'll fall. Just hold on. Not too tight, now. Spirit, look out. What's wrong, Scrooge? l thought you enjoyed looking down on the world. Spirit, l believe l know this place. Yes. lt's old Fezzywig's. l couldn't have worked for a kinder man. Why, it's old Fezzywig himself. And all of my very dearest friends. And that shy lad in the corner, that's me. Yes. That was before you became a miserable miser, consumed by greed. Well, nobody's perfect. And there. There's lovely lsabelle. Ebenezer? - Ebenezer? - Yes, lsabelle? My eyes are closed, my lips are puckered, and l'm standing under the mistletoe. You're also standing on my foot. l remember how much l was in love with her. ln ten years' time you learned to love something else. Why... why, it's my counting house. Nine thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, nine thousand... Ebenezer. Yes, what is it? For years l've had this honeymoon cottage, Ebenezer. l've been waiting for you to keep your promise to marry me. Now l must know: have you made your decision? l have. Your last payment on the cottage was an hour late. l'm foreclosing the mortgage. You loved your gold more than that precious creature, and you lost her forever. Nine thousand, nine hundred, seventy- three. Please, Spirit, l can no longer bear these memories. Take me home. Remember, Scrooge, you fashioned these memories yourself. Why was l so foolish? Why? Why? What's this? Fee. Fi. Fo. Fum. l smell... l mean, l smell a stingy little Englishman. l think l do. Yeah, l do. Please, let me go. Don't eat me. Why would the Ghost of Christmas Present - that's me - want to eat a distasteful little miser like you? Especially when there are so many good things to enjoy in life. See? Mince pies. Turkeys. Suckling pig. And don't forget the chocolate pot roast with ''pisnachio''. Duh, with ''pisnachio''. Duh, with... With yogurt. But where did all this come from? From the heart, Scrooge. lt's the food of generosity, which you have long denied your fellow man. Generosity, ha. Nobody has ever shown me generosity. You've never given them reason to. And yet there are some who still find enough warmth in their hearts even for the likes of you. No acquaintance of mine, l assure you. Duh, you'll see. Duh, here we are. Why did you bring me to this old shack? This is the home of your overworked, underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit. What's she cooking? A canary? Surely they have more food than that? Look on the fire. Duh, what? Oh, that's your laundry. Not yet, children. We must wait for Tiny Tim. Coming, Father. l'm coming. Oh, my. Look at all the wonderful things to eat. We must thank Mr Scrooge. Tell me, Spirit, what's wrong with that kind lad? Much, l'm afraid. lf these shadows remain unchanged, l see an empty chair where Tiny Tim once sat. Then that means Tim will...? Where did they go? Spirit. Where are you? Don't go. You must tell me about Tim. Don't go. Where did...? Who are you? Are you the Ghost of Christmas Future? Please, speak to me. Tell me, what will happen to Tiny Tim? Oh, no. Spirit, l didn't want this to happen. Tell me these events can yet be changed. l've never seen a funeral like this one. Aye. No mourners, no friends to bid him farewell. Oh, well. Let's rest a minute before we fill it in, eh? He ain't going nowheres. Spirit, whose lonely grave is this? Why, yours, Ebenezer. The richest man in the cemetery. Please. No, no, no. No. No. l'll change. l'll change. l'll change. Spirit. Let me out. Let me out. l'll... What...? l'm back in my own room. lt's Christmas morning. l haven't missed it. The spirits have given me another chance. l know just what l'll do. They'll be so surprised. What a wonderful day. Oh, there's so much to do. Oh, so much to do. l can't go out like this. There. That's better. Merry Christmas to one and all. Well, bless me. Good morning, gentlemen. l have something for you. 20 gold sovereigns? Oh, no. Not enough? Well, all right. 50 gold sovereigns. - Really, Mr Scrooge, it's... - Still not enough? Aye. You drive a hard bargain. Here ya are. 1 00 gold pieces, and not a penny more. Thank you, Mr Scrooge. Thank you. And a merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ah, nephew. Uncle Scrooge. l'm looking forward to that wonderful meal of yours. Well, l'll be doggone. You mean you're coming? Of course l am. You know how much l like candied fruits with spiced sugar cakes. l'll be over promptly at two. Keep it piping hot. l will, Uncle Scrooge. l will. And a very merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. And keep the change. Wonderful lads. And now for Cratchit. Why, Mr Scrooge. Merry Christmas. - Won't you come in? - Merry Christmas. l have another bundle for you. But, sir, it's Christmas day. Christmas day indeed. Just another excuse for being lazy. And another thing, Cratchit. l've had enough of this ''half-day off'' stuff. You leave me no alternative but to give you... Toys. Yes, toys. No, no, no, no, no. l'm giving you a raise and making you my partner. A partner? Thank you, Mr Scrooge. Merry Christmas, Bob. And God bless us, every one. Here we are, warm and cosy by the fire's glow Singing songs and stealing kisses under the mistletoe - We finished our feast - Have the tastiest treats But the spirit of Christmas just isn't complete Without true friends and family And the memories we recall It's the love we share that fills the air And makes this the best Christmas of all Something special underneath the tree We hope it fits you perfectly I'm making a wish on a sparkling light But that's not what makes this a magical night It's our true friends and family And the memories we recall It's the love we share that fills the air And makes this the best Christmas of all It's good friends and warm wishes That makes this the best... The best. ..Christmas of all Gee, thanks for letting us share our Christmas spirit with you. Merry Christmas, everybody.
