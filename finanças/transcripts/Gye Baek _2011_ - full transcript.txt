Naesin jwapyeong, you're a loyal subject of this country. I will repent before you sometime in the future. Do you know who the culprit is? It must be either a Silla spy or an assassin. Yes, that's right. The culprit is a Silla spy. Let my death prove my innocence. Who was it? Who killed hyeongnim? (Hyeongnim - respected older brother) We can't let Gye Baek know. General Gye Baek. This is the secret document that the Queen sent here regarding Tobi City's strategy. With her blessings, I was able to capture Tobi City easily. And also, the price to pay, I helped her gain the acknowledgment of hers, and the Crown Prince's bestowment, from Tang. Seong Chung is like you, General, a loyal subject, but what a pity! Although we're enemies, I've admired you for a very long time. If you surrender, General, I will treat you sincerely. How about coming over to my side? Right, the person who killed Seong Chung, was not me, Gim Chun Chu, but your Queen. -= Episode 35 =- Her Majesty said no one is to enter. Move aside! I'm sorry Your Majesty. The General forced his way in, therefore... It's all right. You can leave. Why are you behaving so rashly. You call me rash? Who's the one who actually committed the shameless act? Are you a Silla spy, Your Majesty? The traitor who betrayed Baekje, was it you? I don't know what you're talking about. The one who leaked our intelligence concerning Tobi City to Gim Chu Chu. Furthermore, the price for that was the acknowledgement from Tang concerning yours and the Crown Prince's bestowment. Seong Chung hyeongnim came to know of the matter, that's why you killed him. Why? Why is it you dare not look at it? If look, will it make any difference? Surely it's content will say that I am the spy. So, do you want to inform His Majesty? Go ahead, His Majesty already knows of it. Your Majesty, General Gye Baek is here. Let him in. Shouldn't you be in Doksan City? We have completed our offensive there. Do you know about the Queen being a Silla spy? Are you aware of it? Yes, I know of it. So, you also know that she killed Seong Chung hyeongnim? Yes, that's right. So how can you just let the matter be? Then what do you expect me to do? Do you want me to kill Eun Go with my own hands? Your Majesty. Would you be able to do it? Could you kill Eun Go with your own hands? Yes, if it was me, I would kill her. We lost 8 000 soldiers because of one person. They too have parents, wives and children. Even if she's the most precious person to you right now, even if she was more precious than my own life at one time, to betray Baekje and bring about the deaths of 8,000 men, she must be held accountable for it. I will pay that price on her behalf. Your Majesty. I will do anything. Concerning the loss of the 8 000 soldiers, I will deal with it. I will extend my help and save 8 000 commoners, 80 000 commoners. Don't you feel apologetic and sorry for Seong Chung hyeongnim? Seong Chung hyeongnim and I were different. I left you at one time, but he stayed steadfastly by your side all this while. Can you live with that? I know. Heung Su knows this as well. But, for my sake, and not for the country's sake, he doesn't want to say anything further. Gye Baek, can't you do that as well? Just keep it in your heart, just know that Eun Go is the perpetrator of the crime. You can do that also. There's nothing that I can do. I can't abandon her. Is Your Majesty the monarch of just one woman? Are you not the monarch of this country, Baekje? Not just the monarch of one woman. I am sorry. Have you told His Majesty? No matter what you say it's useless, my mouth will never say those words that you want to hear. I've been a Baekje general for a long time. I continue to live because of the love and respect showered on me by the people. Whenever I return triumphant, they strew flowers in my path, to celebrate my homecoming. Whenever they call my name, my heart fills up with warmth. I've been able to survive on the battlefield, not because I'm capable, but because their families have said to me ten million times not to die, but to come home alive. I continue to push myself forward as repayment to them. I've gained much knowledge and experience on the battlefield. Your Majesty, as Baekje's longtime Queen, what have you realized? As this country's most precious woman, what have you gained? Are you trying to teach me now? What is it that you are trying to say exactly? Heaven, and the people of this country, if they have given you your past glory, as a human being, one must repay this. So, shouldn't Your Majesty also repay the people for what they've given to you? General... I won't do anything. I won't ask for you to be punished, nor will I forgive you. But please remember this. Even if I don't do anything, Your Majesty will pay a price for this eventually. Your Majesty, we have a serious problem. Hurry up, you have to leave this place with me immediately. What is it? What's written here? What does it say? What's written here? How can this be? It says our Queen is a Silla spy. Silla spy? Is it true? How can that be? It doesn't make any sense. Just to obtain Tang's acknowledgement, she sold our country's military secrets to Silla. Seriously, the royal family has sold out Baekje? If this is true, our Baekje is finished. How can that happen? How can the Queen betray Baekje? The situation is far from good. These accusations were pasted all over the walls of Sabi City. This must surely be the work of Gim Chun Chu's spies acting under his orders. Your Majesty, you can't return to the palace now. We must keep away. Where can I go? Let's go to Silla together. I was afraid something like this might happen, that's why I didn't kill my subordinate. I've contacted him, let's meet up with him. Then what about Hyo? Hasn't Prince Hyo been sent to Wae country as an envoy? We'll just notify him to stay there for the time being. Your Majesty, please make up your mind. What shall we do? It's all the Queen's fault. It's all because of the Queen that my son died on the battlefield. What shall we do? Stop calling her Queen. If this is true, she's not the Queen, and not a subject of Baekje. For her own selfish desires, and that of her son, she betrayed the country. Your Majesty, let's get out of here quickly. She betrayed Baekje! Your Majesty, are you all right? Let's go to Silla. You have made up your mind? We have to go. We have to see Gim Chun Chu. You've made a wise decision. Your Majesty. Your servant, Sa Taek Ja has something to report. Last night there were messages pasted all over the walls of Sabi City, but it's difficult for me to speak of the contents. What is the matter all about? The Queen and wisa jwapyeong have been accused as spies. Your Majesty, this could be a rumour spread by the enemy, but if there's any truth in it, then this is a most heinous crime. We must start an investigation into the matter immediately. Your Majesty, time is of the utmost importance, please let us have your edict quickly. Jojeong Jwapyeong. Yes, Your Majesty. This must surely be Silla's evil plan. Look for the culprits of this evil plan immediately. Be meticulous in your investigation concerning the Queen and wisa jwapyeong. Yes, Your Majesty. Didn't you say she was here? She clearly didn't go out. Your Majesty, the Queen's whereabouts are unknown. Your Majesty, we weren't able to locate the whereabouts of wisa jwapyeong. Your Majesty, it seems like both of them have gone into hiding. Looks like the messages on the city walls are true. Order the palace guards to pursue both of them immediately. Make sure they are brought before me. Your servant complies with your order, Your Majesty. Doksan City and Dongjang City, you entered the cities without any bloodshed? This looks like Silla's plan. To abandon the city, giving the impression that they don't want to fight so that we'll let our guard down, but planning a massive attack secretly. Resurrection? That's a possibility. But with our alliance with Goguryeo, no matter where they choose to attack, they'll be similarly attacked. Would Gim Chun Chu do that if he doesn't have any backing? The one that Gim Chun Chu trusts, isn't it Tang? Will Silla and Tang launch a joint attack? Looks like I'll have to go to Goguryeo personally, and meet Yeong Gye Somun. The capital is in turmoil, will things be fine if you are not around? This is more important than that. Rather than just one person, the Queen, this will affect the lives of all the people of Baekje. Yes, you're right. You must be careful. Hyeongnim, you should also finish up the book on the art of warfare as soon as possible. Yes, I will work harder. -= Goguryeo's Camp =- You came at the right time, I was about to seek you out. Is it concerning Silla? Not Silla, but Tang. What is it? Tang has readied 2 000 warships. Did you say 2 000? 2,000 will mean they can carry 100 000 soldiers, right? Just as you said General, Goguryeo and Baekje are sitting in the same boat through rain and thunderstorms. (stick together through hard times) Don't just look at the problem from Baekje's angle. I hope that you're able to widen your vision before making any decisions. I'll do the same. That goes without saying. If Tang were to attack using the sea route, there are 2 options to choose from. One starts from the continent following the coast to Wuzhou. Previously, Tang has used this route to attack us. If Tang were to use the same route, then it's their intention to attack Goguryeo. That should be it. The other route is the Jeoksan route. -= Jeoksan route: a straight road linking the Korean Peninsular to Shandong Peninsular. =- If it's the Jeoksan route, isn't that the route that was opened up by our Baekje? Silla is occupying our Danghang City, the city that we lost. Yes, the Jeoksan route is a direct route through the Yellow Sea. If Tang were to choose the Jeoksan route, -= Magpie Island: present Baengnyeong Island, South Korea =- they must pass Magpie Island. If they move northwards they'll be attacking us, -= Magpie Island: present Baengnyeong Island, South Korea. =- if they move southwards they'll be attacking Baekje. Who will the Tang be attacking, Goguryeo or Baekje, nobody can predict right now. On our investigation into Silla's troop movements, our spies have informed us there's nothing out of the ordinary. What is Baekje's view? As you know, General, we've recaptured Doksan City and Daeha City by just walking in. They must definitely be up to something. General, why are you back so early? Let's go back to Sabi City quickly. Hurry up. Tang has readied 2 000 warships. Is that true? Yeong Gye Somun, more than anybody else, is very wary of Tang. It must be true. 2 000 warships means 100 000 soldiers. As it stands now, we don't know who Tang will be attacking. Is the captain of the royal guard there? Yes, Your Majesty. We're going to hold an emergency meeting, call all the ministers to attend. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Do you want to ask about the Queen? We've sealed all the borders, but we still don't know her whereabouts. If she doesn't end up in Silla, this probably would be a good thing. 2 000 warships? They've readied 100 000 soldiers. Is it our Baekje or Goguryeo? Who will they be attacking? I need everybody's views. Daejwapyeong, please start and let us know your opinion. Your Majesty, this is something unbelievable. We must first confirm whether the information is authentic. General Gye Baek obtained this information personally from Yeong Gye Somun. I believe General Gye Baek. I believe his information is true. All of you should accept the information that Tang is preparing for war as true. The problem is, who is Tang going to attack. Your Majesty. it's not as simple as that. We must first have an in depth discussion on this. Then let's do that. And please remember this, this is concerning our country's future. Yes, Your Majesty. Because of the Queen, the entire country is now in turmoil, and Tang is preparing for war. This is really adding frost on top of snow. (one disaster after another) Fortunately we know that Tang is now preparing for war. The problem is Silla. We really have no idea about their movements. It's better if we prepare ourselves in advance. If they don't attack us, it'll be good. That is also correct. What is difficult is we don't know how to defend ourselves against Silla. Yes, right. Wife. Baekje may be facing a major crisis, you have to prepare yourself. Don't worry. When have I ever been weak? I'm more worried about you, General. -= In the vicinity of Silla's border =- It's the troops manning the Silla border. From here onwards will be Silla's territory. But... Why is it we can't see any light? Yes, you're right. He agreed to meet us here. Be still! Where are you from? We have been invited to come. They look suspicious, seize them! Yes. What are you doing? We were clearly invited to come. We didn't receive any orders, you must be Baekje spies. Take them away for interrogation. Yes. Aren't you going to let me go? Who do you think you're touching? Stop! Greetings, city lord. They are my guests. Respected guests. Make sure you treat them well. Yes. I'm sorry, I'm late. I'm sorry that I wasn't here earlier. By the time I finished all my work, it was late. It's all right. It's a relief that you were able to come. If you weren't here, we would be in trouble. But... It's a pleasant surprise to know that you're now a city lord. It's all due to your credit, Sir. For giving me a chance to perform meritorious deeds, and for saving my life when it was about to be extinguished. N-No... T-That... I-I didn't do it. It was Her Majesty's order. I would like to meet the Tang monarch. His Majesty has asked me to take you both to the capital city, but it'll be dark soon. Stay here tonight and we'll go tomorrow. Thank you so much. Many thanks to you. Really... Your Excellency is my benefactor. Now the both of you can rest assured. Wait until Baekje is annihilated, then we'll give the two of you endless wealth and glory. Annihilate Baekje? So, is Silla preparing for war? There's nothing that can't be said. Tang and us have already made our preparations. Tang's main military forces are already on the move. Do you know how many troops they have? 130 000. 130 000? Together with our Silla's 200 000 troops, we'll raze Baekje to the ground. Baekje will perish. You're both very fortunate that you've come to Silla. Don't you think so, Your Majesty? Now Baekje, will really vanish from the face of the earth. No matter what, I can't let this be. I must go back. What are you saying? If you go back, there's only death waiting. Even if His Majesty were to spare you, Baekje's destiny is now over. Didn't you hear what he said? No one can defeat 200 000 troops. No, it's still not too late. I must go and look for His Majesty and General Gye Baek, and tell them to make the necessary preparations. Then we can prevent our country from being annihilated. Just forget everything, forget it all. It's a war that cannot be won. Your Majesty, you're supposed to go with me to the capital city tomorrow. You know that, don't you? No, this can't be. I must tell them. I won't ask you to go back with me, but please let me go back. Help me to get back. Your Majesty, what are you trying to do now? I came with you, because I want to use this potion to assassinate Gim Chun Chu. Your Majesty. What...? I want to kill Gim Chun Chu, who has turned me into this. I want to die together with him. But... not now. The place I want to die is not Silla, but Baekje. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. your horse is over there. There are also no soldiers over there. If you want to leave now, the coast is clear. Your Majesty. your servant cannot follow Your Majesty, I'm sorry. Please take care of yourself. No, Your Excellency, thank you very much for your help. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Where did you go? The city lord is waiting for you. Why are you here by yourself? Where is the Queen? I don't know about that either, she's not in her room. What is going on here? If Your Excellency doesn't know, who does? Tell me, where did the Queen go? It's true, I really don't know. If you don't know who else will know? Cad! You're the person who allowed the Queen to escape. Really... I was too lax, thinking that I had her in my grasp. Why are you talking like that? Go and pursue the Queen quickly. Yes. She can't have gone far. If you can't capture her alive, just bring her dead body back here. What are you trying to do? How can you treat me in this manner? You came looking for your own death. What do you think we do to people who are willing to betray their own country? Cad! What are you trying to say? This isn't what we agreed. Agreed? His Majesty's decree is to kill both of you and send your bodies to Ui Ja. Cad! How did I treat you before? And I even saved you. Now you, now you betray me? You despicable villain. You are a spy, and you dare to talk about me. Your Majesty. you must take care of yourself. Intercept her! That way! I can't die. I absolutely must not die. I must inform, inform His Majesty, inform the General. What did you find out? We can't see any troop movements. What about the other side? It's the same. There's no news whatsoever. There's also no news of Tang's army getting ready for war. What about your side? Also no news? Nothing, there's nothing. General. Could it be that you're overreacting? We've frightened Silla away. And Tang, if Tang wants to attack, they will attack Goguryeo, why would they attack us? Until now, they have not attacked us even once. No, this situation is even stranger. Allowing us to seize two cities, but still no news is forthcoming. They're deliberately trying to make us drop our guard. This can't go on, we must get the right information any way we can. Start making inquiries all over again. I've many informants, but even with so many, I'm not getting any news. Really... Cad! This isn't a matter of just one or two cities, this concerns the whole country. Aren't you going? Yes, General. Your Majesty. what happened to you? Your Majesty. Cho Yeong... Your Majesty, you've regained consciousness. It's you, Cho Yeong. But where is this place? This is my house. Your Majesty came here by yourself. You can't recall? That's right, it was me who came looking for the General. Your Majesty, what has happened? Are the rumours true? I'm embarrassed to face you. I must see General. He's not here. He's very busy and hasn't been home in a long time. Then, I must return to the palace. You can't do that. And also... There are many soldiers on the lookout for your Majesty outside. Then, I'm sorry. Can you go and bring the General here? General. What is it? Please hurry up and return home. Her Majesty came. Your Majesty. General. What is it? I am sorry. I'm sorry, General. I came because I've something to tell you. Silla and Tang are going to annihilate Baekje and are readying themselves for war. What are you saying? Tang has 130 000 troops, in addition, Silla has 200 000 troops, They're coming to attack Baekje. How do you know? I am sorry. It's all my fault. From whom did you get this information? I heard this from the Silla army, but this is reliable information. General, you must think of a plan to counter their offensive quickly. Now, the person the people of Baekje can trust, except for you, there's no one else. Where are you going? I am a most heinous criminal, I want to go and beg His Majesty for his forgiveness. General, you must protect and guard Baekje. Your Majesty, you can't go now. I will take you there. If you were to go out now, the people will react violently. It's not necessary. I'll go by myself. Even if I'm stoned to death when I walk by them, there's nothing that can be done. I committed the crime. I have to pay the price for that crime. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, please let me accompany you there. Was I not the one who attended to you from childhood days? Our Eun Go agassi wants to atone for her crimes with dignity before His Majesty. I will protect you to the end. It's Her Majesty! Her Majesty the Queen is here! Step aside! Her Majesty is here to see His Majesty. Thank you for accompanying me this far. You should go back now. Go and convey to His Majesty, the most heinous criminal, Eun Go, has returned. What? Did you say the Queen has returned? Yes, Your Majesty. She said she wants to receive her punishment now. She's in the courtyard of the main hall. Your Majesty. Please kill me. Don't forgive this most heinous criminal, Eun Go, for her crime! I have committed a most heinous crime, please do not forgive me. For my crime, I should die a thousand deaths. Your Majesty, although you might find this difficult, I audaciously request, to use my life, to atone for my crimes to Baekje, and to Your Majesty. But... prior to that, I've something to say. Silla and Tang, in order to attack Baekje, are currently preparing themselves for an all out war. You must immediately ready your defensive countermeasures against their imminent attack. What are all of you doing? Take this most heinous criminal and imprison her! Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, please execute the Queen, for violating our country's laws and a multitude of other similar crimes. Even if it was the Crown Prince, a member of the royalty, there can be no exceptions. If this continues, the people won't just let it pass. She must be punished severely. She must be punished severely. Your Majesty, the matter of Her Majesty's punishment is not urgent right now. Concerning Silla and Tang's imminent attack, planning a defensive countermeasure against that should be our priority. Didn't the Queen convey to us the information about Silla and Tang's intended attack? If we don't come up with a defensive strategy to defend ourselves immediately, we'll miss the opportunity to do so. General, the Queen is a spy conspiring with Silla. How can we believe the words of a spy? That's right, Your Majesty. We can no longer believe in the Queen. Didn't the General himself say that Silla hasn't taken any retaliatory action against us? No, that's not it. Even though they haven't retaliated for the time being, there are many things that are suspicious. Your Majesty, it's obvious that Silla and Tang are eyeing Goguryeo covetously. We shouldn't demonstrate openly that we want to start a confrontation with Tang. If we provoke Tang, nothing good will come of it, don't you agree Your Majesty? If we're going to reassign our army with the excuse of defending ourselves from Tang, the defence on the eastern border will be severely weakened. This may instead allow Silla to attack us. This could also be the Queen's devious plan. All of you should consider this carefully. Her Majesty still chose to return despite knowing that she'll be facing death. The information that Her Majesty conveyed, has to be the absolute truth. It's imperative that all of you believe that. General, do you still believe in the Queen? Because of Her Majesty, we lost Tobi City. Weren't you the one who lost thousands of soldiers? Your Majesty, we must not believe in Her Majesty anymore. Regarding this matter, I will give it my utmost consideration. Gye Baek. Do you really believe in the Queen's words? Your servant finds Her Majesty words very consistent. Please believe Her Majesty. It's clear that Silla and Tang are not preparing for war against Goguryeo, but their target is us. But what the other ministers said, isn't it possible that Her Majesty is trying to deceive us with false information? The Queen is smarter than most people, shouldn't Your Majesty of all people know that better than anyone else? If the information is false, would the Queen risk her life to convey it? I will go and see the Queen myself. Why did you return? Since you had already left... since you had left, you should have gone into hiding. Why did you come back? Why? Why do you want to make me kill you with my own hands? It's because I want to die by your hands that I came back. The person who saved me was Your Majesty, and the person who can kill me can only be Your Majesty. You have already betrayed the lives of 8 000 people, but now you've returned to convey to us information about Silla's troop movements. Do you think by doing that your sin can be forgiven? Even if I forgive you, the common people will never forgive you. Your Majesty. I, Eun Go, didn't come back to be pardoned. I can't even forgive myself, how can I be preposterous enough to seek forgiveness? I want to die, only then can the people's resentment towards the royal family diminish, that I know. Furthermore, by my death, the troops and the people will sacrifice their lives to save this country. The reason why I came back, is to protect and guard the people from the hands of the enemy, in order to redeem my sins. So now... only now, you can see things clearly. Eun Go, no matter how I see it, there's just no way that I can protect you. It's a fact that you leaked General Gye Baek's military strategy to Silla. Yes. What was your purpose in doing that? Was it to obtain Tang's imperial mandate for yours and the Crown Prince's bestowment? That's right. Conspiring with Gim Chun Chu. Is that true? Yes. Your Majesty, Jojeong jwapyeong reports, after a thorough investigation, the conclusion shows, the Queen, in order to obtain Tang's imperial mandate, -= Imperial Mandate: the document that validates the Crown Prince's ascension to the throne. =- conspired with Gim Chun Chu. -= Imperial Mandate: the document that validates the Crown Prince's ascension to the throne. =- She handed over General Gye Baek's military strategy to Silla, and caused the deaths of 8 000 soldiers who were defending Tobi City. And also assassinated naedu jwapyeong Seong Chung, who discovered her crime. All this was done at Her Majesty the Queen's behest. Your Majesty, you must execute the Queen in a public arena before the people. Please issue your royal decree. Please issue your royal decree. Please issue your royal decree, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek seeks permission to speak. Her Majesty has committed a heinous crime which is difficult to pardon, but please delay the punishment to be meted out. General, what are you saying? The Queen has betrayed the country, and if we don't execute her immediately, the people's wrath will throw this country into turmoil. It's the opposite, daejwapyeong. If we execute the Queen, would we not be playing into the hands of Gim Chun Chu and Silla? I'm not saying the Queen shouldn't be punished, but our priority is to notify the people the danger our country is in right now. It's not necessary for us to do what the enemy wants. After this crisis has passed, we we'll proceed with her punishment. Presently, this is the best solution. General, there has never been a precedent whereby we can delay the punishment of a heinous criminal. Then create a precedent. Aren't we in a state of war now? This concerns the future of our country. If we act in accordance with what the enemy wants, isn't that high treason too? General, please be careful what you say! Furthermore, what do you mean by this is a state of war? The information about Tang and Silla's imminent attack against us, was supplied by a spy. How can we be sure of its authenticity? Stop it. Apart from Deok Sol Gye Baek, everyone else is in favour of execution, am I right? That's right. If there's a minister who agrees with the General, we'll postpone the execution. Is there a person here who agrees with the General? There's no person here who agrees with the General. Your Majesty, you should just... The person who agrees with General Gye Baek... Your Majesty, is your servant Heung Su still the naesin jwapyeong? Yes, we haven't appointed anyone to replace you presently. Everyone. I, Heung Su, resents the Queen more than anyone else. All of you know that. The person who I was very close to, Seong Chung, died at the hands of the Queen. I, more than anyone else, wants to kill the Queen. But, feeling like I do, I still believe that our priority is to save the country. So, I hope that all of you will abide by General Gye Baek's words and act in accordance with his wishes. Your Majesty, here is the book on the art of warfare that was left unfinished by Seong Chung. Your incompetent servant has completed it. Heung Su. Don't leave here again. Stay by my side and protect the country. No, Your Majesty. The reason why I came today was so that I can give to you this military warfare book. I've come to bid you my last farewell. Please ensure that you defend Baekje's territory. The execution has been postponed. Was it you who held them off? That wasn't necessary. All I want is to end my life as quickly as possible. General. I entrust you. How can you do that? It's not just your life alone. Throwing this country into chaos, what are you thinking? This concerns the lives of tens of thousands of Baekje troops and its people. No matter how much you want to die, you absolutely can't die right now. Is that so? I, Eun Go, who wants to die, but I can't even do that? General. General, news has come from the general at the frontier. Tang's army of 130 000 are not heading to Goguryeo, but towards our Baekje. -= Next Episode Preview =- Gim Yu Sin led forces are now gathered in Namsan. You have duelled with Gye Baek on so many occasions, but you still don't understand him. It will not be easy to break their defences. You must, please be safe and sound. In retrospect, heaven has given me a very valuable gift. Younger brother, you must come back alive so that we achieve our vision together. I'm happy, my love. My lifeblood. Don't die. You must live, just so you can return to your home.
