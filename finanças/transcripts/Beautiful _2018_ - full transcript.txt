I will do it for you. - Thanks, but I'm okay. Beom-hae... It's like you're being chased everyday. You don't have... any secrets to me? Wear this at the next party. Well... I will study abroad. At Hawaii... You know, for three long years. My uncle lives there. Thank you for everything, anyway. Though we met online... you've been so nice to me. That's all. Must have dozed off. I'll go back to my place. Are you... waiting for somebody? Yes. What a perfect night... it's not true? - You like it? - I like so much! - You like over all. Wow! - This bitch achieved a lot. - See, losing weight is everything. - Omo... won't it be a ghost? - Yes, it is. I got suspicious and signed in again. Boom, I was blocked. Gosh, total craziness!

We'll get those imposters' pussies blocked dead tight! - Won't we? - Of course... locked, tight. - How Cute! - Hello, crazy. - You used to be an imposter! - Omo!

I am pissed! - Who's calling? - There's this guy! - Gotcha! - Bring it back! - Hello! - Pyeong Beom-hae, where are you right now? You are the imposter, you used Dodo's pic and chatted with me, pretending as Dodo! Don't you try to trick me! Where are you now? Answer it! Eh? 'Can't take your call right now....' Beom-hae, why did you do that? Uh? I liked the way you were! Now you don't, do you? Beom-hae! Take your hands off me! We are all about beauty, shall'nt we? So you disappeared and made all that mess. Look... are we here in Hawaii? What the hell is this all about? Why did you do that... uh? - Hyeong, I am sorry... - What's up? No excuses today. Were you happy being Dodo? Did you like playing me? You... are into guys like Dodo. I... just wanted to be like him. Be him. Someone whom everyone loves. Do you even know how much I tried to find you? Hyeong... You are going nowhere... I won't permit that. Now you must know how I feel. It matters nothing... you love guys like Dodo... What the hell is this situation? Nonsense... you are this beautiful. It's all about beauty. Everything is. So... let yourself be it. Just the way you are. - The world has gone to the dogs. - It just can't end like this! Told ya, I got this new car... let's get dirty. - Two better than one! - Three better than two. Then... four... must be the best. What's fun... eh, Beom-hae? What's this... a book? Hey, what a nasty book it is! - Beom-hae, I can not believe you've been read like nasty. - This book... Right, it's little bit nasty, but it's famous. Stop being so coy, Beom-hae. Why not? I got a skin trouble lately, Sang-whi... look... I see... you have to change your skin, Beom-hae.
