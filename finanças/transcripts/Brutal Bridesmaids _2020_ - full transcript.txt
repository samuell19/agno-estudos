[♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Kristin laughing] [Jessica] Which one of you is it? Which one? You carved out an entire afternoon to spend with me this weekend. I'm the luckiest girlfriend on earth. [Michael chuckling] [Michael] I know. I know I've been living at the office lately. I'm teasing. I know it's been a crazy time for you. Well, you've had some insane times at work yourself if I do recall. Yeah, some clients think I'm their therapist and on call 24/7, not their interior designer, you know? You do talk people off ledges, baby. [Laughing] But things are going to calm down after your merger's closed, right? Yeah, yeah. They're gonna hand you that promotion on a silver platter. I know it. A lot of things will be different, I think. I know. It feels longer than a year ago, doesn't it? It does. What? I just remember freaking out, like I wasn't sure if I should try to kiss you because I didn't want to be too forward on our first date but the uh, the moment felt right. I'm glad you did. I was totally thought you were so stiff when we met at the gallery. I was nervous. But during dinner, you were much more relaxed then we walked here and by the time we got to this bridge and you kissed me, I knew I liked you. From the moment we met, I saw all the light and beauty inside of you. I knew it then I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I wanted to ask you this since the first time we stood here. Jessica Curtis, will you marry me? -Yes! -[Michael] Yes? -Yes, of course. -[Michael] Yes, yes? Yes. Baby, come here. -[Michael] Oh no. -[Jessica] Oh my god! No! -Oh my god! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, babe. Let me try! -I can get it! -No, no, no, no. You won't find out it down there, baby. Wait, just listen. I grabbed that ring yesterday in a hurry, okay? It's more of a placeholder. I didn't want to wait another day to ask you, so okay, I was gonna get you another thing. I just wanted it to happen. I just wanted it to happen today. -Are you just saying this? -No, I swear. Okay, I swear. Because I had to ask you today. So, baby, just, just come, come off the ledge for a second. Oh my god. You were really gonna dive in there? I do like shiny things, but I'll wear a paperweight for you. You're so cute. Hmmm, ah, I love you so much. This is certainly not how I imagined our afternoon date to go. Wooh, yeah. Jeez. Uhm, well, at least we have a good engagement story, huh? I mean if we were gonna have a wedding disaster, at least we got it out of the way. Exactly. So can we just agree from here no drama, no stress? And simple. Yes. Welcome home! Hmm. Are you psychic? I'm starving. Figured you would be after working all weekend and the long drive back. Yeah. I don't know how you manage to lug that thing around. If you weren't a photographer, I'd think you had a dead body in there. Oh, trust me, I almost killed a few of the models this weekend. It was supposed to be a simple shoot, but it was just drama one after another. I got you. Have I ever told you you're the best roommate ever? Few times. [Laughing] Good, 'cause it's true. Okay, you are positively glowing. Something big happen. Something at work? No way. Michael proposed yesterday! [Screaming] Oh, oh my god! [Chuckling] Let me see. Oh, that's a long story. Wait, so does that mean me coming home to dinner and wine are near in end? Oh, I'll always cook you dinner when I'm in town. That merger Michael's working on, turns out it's leading to a promotion in San Diego. California? And it's happening fast in the next three months. [Scoffs] Wait, as in three months from now? And since neither of us have a lot of close family and we want the wedding really simple, we're doing it before the move. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're getting married in three months? Actually, we found an amazing venue right on the beach, Chandler estate. Yeah, I've seen pictures. It's gorgeous. It is, and they miraculously had a cancellation next month. So we jumped on it. [Laughing] Wow. Um, uh, that's great. Are you okay? Yeah. Do you need to sit down? I'm just processing all of this. So you're getting married in a month and then moving across the country. If all goes as planned, yes. And the venue has a planner that will handle almost everything. I'll just need some help here and there from my bridesmaids, and my maid of honor if she's not leaving town that weekend. Oh my god! If I have anything booked, consider it canceled. But on one condition, I get to do your wedding photos. It'll be my gift. Good. I couldn't afford your rate anyways. Yeah, I know. Seriously though, I'm really happy for you guys. I know that it hasn't been easy for either of you. Everything that happened with your parents and Michael's family being total assholes. Assholes, yes, but now you both get the happy ending you deserve. That's such a sweet thing to say. Well, I mean it with all my heart. Yeah, I know you do. How is that? Your face? It's an open book. I can always tell when you're lying. I am a horrible liar, aren't I? That time you ate the last cupcake in the fridge, and you acted like I was crazy for asking where it went? Okay, not my finest moment. Now, let's toast! [Laughing] Here you go. Here we are. To the best, most amazing wedding adventure and the best maid of honor ever. Aw, and to an amazing couple. Cheers. [Chuckling] Hmm, now, let's eat. Then I have to call the rest of the girls and ask them to be bridesmaids. Should be interesting. Oh, I'm sure it will be. Who else are you asking? Hello. There she is. Oh, I cannot sleep after you called me last night with the big news. This is so exciting. I'm so happy you're going to be my bridesmaid. To be honest, I was a little surprised you asked me. What's it been, a little over a year since we've met? It feels like 20 years after everything we've been through here. Well, people do bond fast when they're in the trenches together, don't they? Plus you introduced me to Michael at that gallery, so yeah, who would have knew that me introducing you to him will lead to all of this? A wedding. You moving. It's all my fault, isn't it? You have no one to blame but yourself. Do you have a second? Yeah. Ugh, so you're not gonna make me wear a ruffled pink dress, are you, because I'm still having PTSD from my high school homecoming. No. It's about the idea you and I had. Starting our own firm? I had assumed that was off the table now. I feel terrible. I know you've already put fillers out to the clients, but with the whirlwind that's about to happen, I need to hit pause. I'm so sorry. Once I get settled in, maybe I can work remotely and I get it. You have to do what's best for you. Are you sure you're okay? You seemed a little upset on the phone. It was a lot to take in, but what have I always said to do when clients or life throws you a curve ball? Improvise. Exactly. And that is what I'm going to do, improvise. I'm still forging ahead with the company. It's just gonna be solo now. I was hoping you'd say that. It's all gonna work out, trust me. Yes. But I do have a client call in five minutes so and I don't have to go break the news to Mr. Anderson. Lunch later? If I don't get escorted off the property. Yeah. He's going to be pissed he's losing one of his best designers, but he's going to keep you every second he can. Oh, and you received the email about the brunch my cousin is throwing for all the bridesmaids on Saturday? I'll be there. Is that your maid of honor, your cousin? Ah, my cousin, Sloan, offered to throw the brunch you know, but my maid of honor is Melanie, my roommate. So you got your cousin and your roommate. Who else is standing? My oldest friend in the world, Binky. Binky? Yeah, it's short for Bianca. Then there's my college friend, Holly, so and they're all friends with each other? Not really. I mean, they've all met here and there, but there's not a lot of history between them. Well, I can't wait to meet them. Bye. [Indiscernible speech] [Indiscernible speech] Hi. Oh my god, oh my god! I missed you. Oh my god! I cannot believe you're gonna marry. That is so crazy. I know. Good to see you, Binky. Oh, you know me for my show or something? Oh, Binky, of course you remember Mel? Oh, that's right. Melissa! It's Melanie. I see you every year at Jess' birthday party. Yeah, of course. Oh god, we've had some fun times at those, haven't we? Yeah, and I see you've already started today. Um, when Sloan rented out this place and it's free alcohol, so I did not want to miss the opportunity. Do you girls want some? Yes. Yeah. A couple of mimosas please? Make that three while you're at it, please. Hello. This is Kristin, my partner in crime at the office. Her wisdom has helped me land some big accounts. I'm sure you're sad she's moving away. Well, we did have some plans, but who can step in the way of true love, right? Holly! Hi! Holly, I feel like it's been forever. Well, four kids in seven years will do that. Oh my god. Oh my god. I remember that she was pregnant at your birthday a couple years ago, and we were wine tasting. That must have been so boring for you. [Chuckling] Well, it certainly wasn't boring when you threw up all over me on the party bus. What a day, right? But dealing with you that day helped prepare me for all the times I've had to deal with whiny, sick children, so I guess I should thank you. Oh. Why don't we all sit down? Sloan texted saying she's gonna be a few minutes late, okay? I'm good with water. Thanks. So, Sloan, she's your cousin, right? Yeah, we're a couple years apart so we weren't close when we were kids. Oh my god. I remember when she punched bad hinick in the face on the playground because he got your backpack dirty. [Laughing] Oh man, yeah. She always had my back. She's late to the brunch that she organized. It's always something with her, isn't it? You know that she's going through a lot right now. How did she react when you asked her to be her bridesmaid after what happened? If a guy ever did to me what Rick did to her, I would kill him. Wait, what happened? I caught my fiancé boning one of my bridesmaids, boning in the backroom of the church on our wedding day. Sloan, I'm so glad you made it. I'm sorry I'm late, especially since I'm supposed to be hosting mess. This is Kristin um, from the firm that I told you about. [Sloan] Yeah, hey. How did the interview go? Must have went well, it went so long. It's just an interview. But yeah, Binky, I did wanna kill Rick. I also wanted to kill the bridesmaid from hell whose name shall not be spoken. But for better or worse, Jessica and a few others held me back. I mean, you pick your closest family and friends to stand next to you on the biggest day of your life, right? And then one of them betrays you? But I learned an important lesson that day, that anybody can betray you and stab you in the back, even your own bridesmaid. Well, now that we're all here, I wanna thank you for being part of my wedding next month. You all know that I lost my parents when I was a kid. So having each one of you there means I'll have family there because each one you is like a sister to me. I hope that over the next few weeks, you all can become sisters to each other as well. To my bridesmaids! -Woo! -Yay! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! You know, it's bad luck to cheers with water, right? I have to take my son to softball after this and to take my daughters to dance, so I guess you'll just have to drink for me today. [Binky] Fair enough. We had this guy on my show who was sober, so obviously he was really bad TV so we just had him put it off. Was this one of those vulgar reality shows where everyone's in the same house and you all sleep together? Yeah, it was really popular, what, back in college? No, it still is. They still ask you to do the reunions every year, right? Yeah, of course. But you know, I'm so busy that sometimes I can't get to it. Yeah, Rick, and I used to watch it. Rick was my fiancé the one that yeah, I got it. Let's not focus on the negative, shall we? [Chuckles] I'm sorry. I guess I'm still getting over it. And um, I never want anyone to suffer the way I did, so well, I can't imagine anyone here doing anything to hurt Jessica or disrupt her wedding. Thank you for coming by to go for everything. Everyone at Chandler estate is thrilled the open date worked for you and Michael. It did create a bit of a time crunch and there are decisions to be made. I know it's overwhelming. Oh, it's a funny story when Michael proposed, I accidentally knocked the ring out of his hands two seconds after I saw it. Oh. It's sitting at the bottom of a pond. Oh dear. We'll have a replacement by the wedding day. What is it? Nothing, dear. There's an old saying if you lose your engagement ring before the wedding what, like a bad omen? Never mind. Silly superstition stuff. Let's get started. Yes, yes. Oh my god, yes, we'll be there. Thank you so much. Awesome. There's my bride. [Kissing] You ready for wine Wednesday? That was chicone's bridal, the exclusive police downtown that takes months to get an appointment at. Of course, I know chicone's. Let me guess, you worked your magic? Mel did. Being a photographer comes with a ton of wedding connections. I guess you picked the right maid of honor. But they were only able to schedule a two-hour appointment for us to look at bridal gowns and bridesmaids dresses. Okay, so we'll take over the place and make it happen. [Chuckles] I'll text the other girls on the way to lunch, so I'm sure Sloan is gonna be so weird. I mean, seeing her at the brunch the other day reminded me of how crae that girl can be. Come on, I think the wedding may just be reopening some old wounds. Well, it's only gonna get worse before it gets better. Let's go to lunch. Just saying. [Binky] Oh wow. I'm impressed. Oh, Jess, this would look amazing on you. Courtney. It's been forever. Thank you so much for squeezing us in. Anything for you, Mel. Oh. Welcome to chicone's, ladies. I'm Courtney and I'm gonna be taking care of you today. And you must be the bride. I am. I'm so excited to be here. My pleasure. Now, first things first. [Cheering] -Yes. -Yes. Thank you. This always helps in the decision making. -Thank you. -Of course. -Thank you. -It does. -Cheers. -Of course. Cheers. It's not that I don't drink at all. I just don't always have to have a drink in my hand time to have a good. I don't know if you would know a good time if it bit you in now then, I know that we're under a tight timeline here, so let's get started with the bride. Since your wedding day is approaching quickly, I chose a few options that shouldn't require hardly any alterations. I'm sure one of them will work out perfectly. I can't wait. Let's do it. All right, follow me to the dressing room area. Oh wait, wait, can I get a group photo? I have to post this. Of course. All right, ready? 1, 2, 3. [Sloan] Yeah. Guys, what do you guys think she's gonna come out next? Oh my god. [Indiscernible speech] Oh my god, I love that one. It's so hot. Do you think it's too revealing? Mmm, you can pull it off. You can pull it off, but it's that what you want your grandchildren to see when they see photos of your wedding? Okay, grandma. I'm just saying it is a lot of skin, but you do look great. It's just not very beach wedding though. All right, let's try something else. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] I love it. Me too. I think this is the one. Yeah. [Courtney] I agree. It's magnificent. Now then our window of time is shrinking. So let's switch gears to the bridesmaids. Why don't each of you take a look through our showroom and pick out a few options. Kristin, that is gorgeous. I agree. It's one of our newest arrivals in the store. That also means it'll be the most expensive, right? Well, that's exciting. Did you expect anything less? I like the cut off this one, but maybe in a different color. Don't you think that style is a little outdated? I could say the same thing about yours. Mel, I love that cut. So elegant. Thank you. It's great. But black for a wedding? [Melanie] What? I thought you'd be happy. Isn't black your favorite color? I like what you each picked out but I'm not in love with any of them either. I want something elegant and fun, simple yet sophisticated. Basically, a bit of each of them. Okay, well, let's head back out to the showroom, but I'm afraid we don't have too much time left. So please do your best to hurry. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Sloan gasps] What the hell was that? Oh, I'm just taking a picture of you in that beautiful dress. Delete it! -Delete it right now! -Relax! What is all the yelling about? Yeah, what's going on? She took a photo of me while I was getting undressed. It is just a little misunderstanding. She knows exactly what she's doing. That's illegal, you know? I think that we all need to calm down. What are you gonna do? Oh, you're gonna go tell on me, Sloan. Look, you can get arrested for this. [Binky] Oh my god. You need to delete it. What makes you think it's okay to take photos of me. -Oh, you know what -[Binky] yeah, leave! -You're leaving, wow! -Stop! What is going on? Binky, took a naked picture of Sloan. What? Binky, give me your phone. Give it to me. It was a joke. Deleted. I think we're done here. We've already gone over our appointment slot. But we didn't settle on any dresses. I think it's best if we call it a day. I'll take all your opinions into consideration, and I'll decide this week. I hope you all support whatever color and style I choose. Of course, we will. Way to have fun, ladies. [Indistinct conversation] You left this in your changing room. Thank you. Oh, and your friend, Sloan, she left out the back door. She did? She told me to tell you that she was sorry. She seemed upset. I'm sorry. Okay, maybe I overreacted. I'm sorry. -What's wrong with you? -What? I said I'm sorry. Don't come at me. I don't even know you. You know your neck is all red. What do you mean my neck is all red? -Oh my god! -That looks bad. Oh my god. Call 911! Oh my god! It's literally everywhere. Help is coming. Relax. Oh that, oh, it itches so bad. Okay, Todd, please call if you need anything. Tell Holly we love her. How's she doing? They were able to reverse the reaction at the hospital. I mean they're keeping her overnight, but she should be fine. Do the doctors know what caused it? They think it was an allergic reaction, maybe a cleaning chemical or something that got in the garment bags. What is it? Sloan's finally texting me back. She broke out, too. That's why she left the store so fast. She's okay now. Well, my itching finally stopped, too. How about you? Disappeared as fast as it came on. Well, Courtney swore it was nothing in the store, but she's still mortified. She promised to give you a discount on the dresses if you still wanna buy from them. You know, it's weird when we got home, I notice a smudge of white powder on my jacket sleeve. [Scoffs] White powder? I mean, I threw it in the wash. I didn't think much of it. What if it was something on our street clothes and not the dresses? What would have been on our clothes? I don't know, like someone put something on them. Okay, open book. What are you thinking? What I'm thinking is we were all running around that store like mad women. So yeah, hypothetically, someone could have come in and put something on our clothes, but why? And who would have done that? Who would do that? So my aesthetician rubbed this Moroccan coconut oil into my skin for two hours and only then did the redness go away. I'm so sorry. I feel horrible about the whole thing. It wasn't your fault. I hope I'm not interrupting any work talk. Hello there, mister. Michael, what a surprise! Congratulations on the engagement. It's such a sudden turn of events. Yeah, well, you never know what life is gonna throw your way. Hmm, you sure don't. Michael had a meeting nearby and popped over to join us for lunch. Damn! I wish I knew. I have to run downtown. I'm gonna go check out some office space. My realtor thinks he found me a perfect location for my firm. That's amazing. I'm so happy you're still doing it. Plus, you two lovebirds have plenty to discuss. Only two weeks ago. Pleasure as always, Kristin. Likewise. Bye. So I saw that email this morning from Tabitha. [Exhales] Everything was good with the caterer. And you saw the flower options? I did. Maybe simpler is better. Exactly. Less is more. Exactly. And how about we go ring shopping this weekend? Because I'd love to get an idea of your wedding band, not to mention replace the engagement ring. Yeah, we need to take care of that and have to get your ring, too, so maybe uh, Sunday? It'd have to be in the morning. Holly's hosting that get-together for the girls in the afternoon. I'm surprised you guys are getting together so soon after what happened last weekend, and that Holly's even up for hosting. Well, she said she's fully recovered and insisted on it. Plus, I wanna see everyone as much as possible before we leave. I can understand that. But hopefully this round is less eventful for you. Well, I mean it can't be any worse, right? I hope not. Welcome. Is someone else here? I thought Jess would be with you. You two seem attached at the hip lately. Just trying to be a good maid of honor to my best friend, I guess. Of course, you are. She's just running errands. She should be here any minute. Please. Come on in. Everything is set up right through here. No kids today? Oh, Todd took them out so I could have some peace. Cute theme. Thanks. Jess always loved taco Tuesdays in college. Funny, I don't think she's ever been to one in all the years we've lived together. Funny. Right this way. Thank god, I found the Tequila or we'd be drinking lemonade and those. Dessert? Sort of. No, those are those Booty blaster shakes that you see in the infomercials at night. Booty blaster? Yeah, why else would she be hosting us? [Binky] To hawk 'em. That is not true. I offered to throw Jessica a shower and she didn't want any of the fuss, so I decided to have a gathering as bridesmaids. And if anyone wants to taste delicious shake or take a sample home, they're welcome to. No, thank you. I'm not ready after my reaction. Okay. Well, you let us know when you're ready to start the party. We won't be holding our breath. Excuse me. [Coughs] Is there any mixer in here? Oh, this is just a teaser for the bachelorette party. The alcohol rep I know is doing all top shelf for the lake house. What lake house? Um, I'm surprised Jess didn't tell you. Uh, I planned the whole thing and ran by her this morning. She was so into it. We were all supposed to discuss bachelorette party ideas today. I know but I figured you were swamped as the maid of honor, so I found the most amazing lake house right next to the wedding venue where we could party the night before the rehearsal. Jess loved the idea. But was that really your place to do that? Yeah, as her oldest and dearest friend, I think it is. Cheers. Oldest is right. Nice place. Thank you. I stayed up all night cleaning. The place looked like a war zone, especially since I was out of commission most of the week. I heard you were in rough shape. I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's not your fault. I heard you had a rash too. Yeah, I mean it was pretty nasty, but I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything. Lucky you. I need to get that. The others are right through there to the kitchen. Here she is! Hey, guys! Look who's here. Oh my god. [Laughing and screaming] You look so good. Mwah. Right. And now my favorite. Thank you, Binky. I love you. Mwah. Cheers. All right, let's get this party started. All right, let's get drinking. Party favors? These are a little side venture I joined. I already got some of my friends from my miss mommy group on board. I thought they'd be great for you, girls, since you're all on the go so much. Booty blaster. It may be a silly name but it is a great product. The cookies and cream are the most popular, but the peppermint bark is my favorite. [Holly] It's not a big deal. I had some extra samples lying around I thought I'd let you girls try them. Oh, I just didn't know this party included a sales pitch. [Holly] It doesn't. Why don't we go to the patio? This way. [Sloan] Yeah. Anyone mind if I capture the day? Don't worry, some people know their boundaries with photography. All right, smile. Anyway, I am so excited for your bachelorette party in a few weeks. It is gonna be lit. Thank you again for planning it. You know I wanted something easy and close to the venue so your idea sounded perfect. But promise me no strippers. Promise. Yeah, I didn't have any strippers at mine. Maybe if I had, the bridesmaid whose name shall not be spoken would have gone for them instead of after Rick. Jess, why don't we open your gifts? All right. All right, as you all know, I didn't want any gifts. But then Holly told me to ask each of you to bring something small and personal that reminded you of our favorite memory together. And I thought that was really sweet, so. I'll go first. Thank you. Mel, oh my god. I remember this like it was yesterday. The day we moved into our first apartment together. Oh, that's great. It's beautiful, thank you. Um, here. Oh, thank you. Ooh, festive. [Gasps] What is that? Trixie, oh my god. This is the doll Binky and I used to play with all the time. You had Trixie and I had Mandy. I had to scour the Internet for an original. So adorable. My turn. It's a mix of all our favorite songs from college, every big moment of our life, from party jams to break-up anthems. Holly, this is so sweet. Man, some of these really take me back. Who even owns a CD player, right? Oh, I think I have one in my car. Thank you. Okay, right. Is this? An Ellingsworth portrait? Ellings, what? Ellingsworth, it's the painter at the exhibition where Kristin introduced me to Michael. I will never forget the way that you two looked at each other, and I knew it will never be the same. This is so amazing. You really didn't have to do this. Thank you, Kristin. Way to keep the gifts small. I guess I'm last. What this is? Don't worry, it's not my wedding ring. I wouldn't have survived my horrible wedding day or everyday since without you. Oh my god, is this [Sloan] The locket you gave me for my birthday right after everything fell apart. It gives me strength. I had to take it to a jeweler and he split it into two. That way, no matter where you are, we'll still always be together. Oh my god, oh this is thank you. I love you. I love you. Who wants some tacos? Tequila. -Yeah, Tequila. -Yeah. [Jessica] Cheers, you guys. My god. [Overlapping conversation] Who is Michael standing with? No one from his family, right? Right, there's a lot of bad blood and drama there. His groomsmen are buddies from college and grad school. They're like his brothers. Better question is do they look like Michael? [Laughing] No, it's a legit question, 'cause you really hit the jackpot, and as soon as I met him, I knew he was the one for you. Thank you, Binky. But I remember when you met him at the gallery, you were like, "Mel, I don't know about this guy." [Jessica] Yeah. I think it took us both a minute. Us? Yeah, I mean Jess wasn't sure at first, but I thought he was a nice guy and great looking. [Melanie] But I'd never guessed you'd be getting married to him. Why is that? Well, Jess always goes after the artistic types. I've always dated the ones with the suits. You do attract a lot of bankers and lawyers. So, Mel, you would say that Michael is more your type. Is he your #mce, man crush every day. Very funny. What, you don't have a thing from Michael, do you? Of course not. Wait, you don't, do you? Open book, Mel. Okay, I was attracted to him at first when we first met. I mean who wouldn't be? But that was it. Are you sure about that? Of course. I would never are you two ever alone together in the apartment? -I bet you are. -[Jessica] Wait. Sloan, you are way out of line. Am I? Or am I just getting closer to the truth? I would never do that to Jess. She's my best friend. Yeah, well, best friends make the best enemies. Believe me. Girl, just 'cause you had the wedding from hell doesn't make every guy a dog and every bridesmaid a whore. Oh yeah, we're gonna do that right now? We do not need to yell. This is not reality TV. Oh, go take the stick out of your ass and go drink a peppermint bark shake, 'cause I am done. You will not speak to me like that in my own house. Hey, did you hear her? Jess, please, don't Okay, party's over. Let's go, girls. Go. A little party favor for you. I know. Give this to Binky. Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry if things got a little heated. I'd blame the margaritas, but I think it's more than that. We're all really different people. You're all good people, and for some reason, you just don't see it in each other. I'm sorry if the shakes were a bad idea. I know it's silly, but it gives me something else to focus on besides talking to kids, you know. It's fine. I'm sure they're great. You know what you're getting into, right? Because the fun, the romance, it all fades away way quicker than you realize. And the whole wedding may not be a good idea. Holly, it's been a long day, okay? Look, I know. I'm sorry. I just want what's best for you. I love you. I love you, too. Thanks again. Deep in thought? Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier. Sloan twisted my words and made me sound like a crazy, jealous roommate. Everyone was so fired up and ready to argue. Look, I need you to hear me. I could not be happier for you. And I need you to know I would never do anything to hurt you. And I know that Michael and you were meant for each other. Am I lying? Remember, open book. I don't need to see your face to know the truth. I know you, and I know things got blown out of proportion. Are you expecting someone? No. What a surprise! Hey, babe. [Kissing] -I know. -Come on in. -Hey, Mel. -Hey. Hey, come. -I got this. -Thank you, baby. I'll let you two have some privacy. Thanks. Is everything okay? Yeah. I kept getting these weird texts from Sloan earlier. Sloan? About what? Asking crazy questions. Like if I ever get weird vibes around Melanie. Warning me not to mess my life up. God. Okay, Holly's hangout got a little out of control. Some things were said. But it was all Margarita-fueled nonsense. I mean Sloan was probably drunk-texting you. [Chuckles] The whole goal was to keep things simple. We have had enough drama in our lives, baby. It just seems like your bridesmaids keep stirring things up for the hell of it. It's like family members not getting along, and they're not used to each other. Family would understand this experience is not about them, right. They'd cast their differences aside and put you first, baby. I have faith in them, and I know things will slow down and calm down by the wedding day. You really believe that? I do. It's getting late, and since you're already here are you seducing me, Mrs. West? It's Ms. Curtis for the time being, but yes, I am. Hmm, well, seduce away then. [Chuckling] I love the ivory plates. I agree. I think they'll look lovely with your centerpieces. Yes. Um, excuse me one moment. Sure. Hey, you. I heard you weren't feeling well. It was those damn shakes. [Jessica] What? The Booty blaster. I was stupid enough to take it and I've been in my bathroom for 12 hours. Something was in it. I mean, calm down. Maybe they went bad or something. No, first that rash and now I've been poisoned. I think somebody did it on purpose. Holly would never do that. Yeah, well, maybe Holly's not that innocent. But it could have been anybody. We were all around the samples at the party. Okay, I'm gonna call the others and see if anyone else is sick. Do you need anything? No. I got to go. It's happening. I'm sorry. One more second, Tabitha. No problem, dear. Hello? Hey, Holly. It's me. Weird question, those shake samples you had at the party yesterday, do they go bad if they're left out? Go bad? No, they don't even need to be refrigerated. That's one of their selling points. Did you wanna buy some? The thing is that Kristin is sick and she thinks it was the shakes. She tried her sample? I didn't think she would. I guess she did. Did you take yours? No, I forgot I had 'em. Oh, anyway, I made the shakes myself. It must have been something else Kristin ate. Yeah, that's what I told her. Hope she gets better soon and doesn't end up in the hospital like I did. Oh, I'm sure it's not that serious, but I'll keep you posted. I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. Bridesmaid trouble? I've seen it all, dear. What is it about weddings that makes everyone act like they're still in middle school? Weddings are milestones that make everyone reflect on their own life. Everything leading to it can stir up a lot of emotions. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and sometimes the worst. But we have a wedding to plan, shall we? Yes. [Tabitha] Okay. Oh, that's no fun. Well, I'm sure she'll be okay. Everybody gets food poisoning. Okay. I'll talk to you soon, baby. Okay. Bye. [Grunting] Oh, baby. Hey. Oh my god. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I was afraid it was a lot worse than they said. Well, the X-ray didn't show anything broken, all right, just some heavy bruising. Nothing that'll show under my tux in a couple weeks. Don't worry about the wedding right now. It could have been a lot worse. This is detective Weaver. You must be Jessica. And you are? Melanie, a friend. So what did happen? Did they Rob you? There's been a rash of muggings in the same business area since the last year, possibly related. Did you see what the guy looked like? No, he was wearing a hoodie or something. We're going over security footage. I can't believe this happened. I do have to ask. Is there anybody I mean, anybody you can think of that would wanna hurt you? No, why? It's strange. The person didn't demand any kind of money before attacking you. Didn't even go over your wallet when you were in the ground. And from what you described, this person was in a rage and then just vanished. Maybe they're on drugs? Possible. But they could have hurt you a lot worse. I'm just not sure why they suddenly stopped. Lucky they did. You have my card. Call me if you can think of anything else. I'll be in touch. Ladies. Thank you. Thank you. I'm okay. Does it hurt? Are you okay? I'm relieved. The last time I received a phone call and rushed to the hospital, things turned out differently. Your parents. Let me stay. You don't have to do this alone. Oh, they said he'll be released early in the morning. I'll just doze off in the chair in there. And you should go home, get some rest. All right. [Melanie] This is so crazy. A lot of crazy stuff's happened lately. The rashes, Kristin getting sick, and now this. You'd think someone was planning it all. What? You don't think it's all connected? I don't know what to think anymore. All I know is that ever since Michael and I got engaged, it's been one thing after another. But who would wanna do that to you guys? It'd have to be someone close to us, someone we know. Maybe the detective spooked you when she asked you if there was anybody that wanted to hurt you. Look, it's been a long night. I should get back to him. Promise me you'll call me if you need anything. I mean anything. I promise. I'll talk to you in the morning. Okay. Hello. Oh my god, I just got a text from Binky. I'm heading there now. No, no, that's not necessary. But you hate hospitals. Michael is already asleep, and we're gonna leave in the morning anyways. If you're sure I'll turn around, but I can always turn back around, okay. Thank you. Do they know what happened? Who attacked him? The cops are still working on it. Good. I'm so sorry this happened, Jess. And those dumb texts I sent after Holly's the other day, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean any of it. You know that, right? It's fine, Sloan. Let's just move on. So the wedding's still happening? We haven't talked about it yet, but I think so. I'm happy to hear that. Thanks for checking in. Of course. I'll call you tomorrow. Don't even think about it. Hang on, baby. I can help you. [Grunts] You've been baby-ing me for over a week now. We're getting married in three days. I sort of need you in one piece, you know. Fair enough, then I guess I have a lifetime to carry things for you, so exactly. Cherish these moments. I will. Wow. Are you sure all of this is gonna fit inside the welcome bags? I may have gone a little overboard but I just wanted to get plenty of goodies for everyone staying at the estate. Yum. No. Yes, ma'am. I guess on that note, I'll get back to my place and finish packing for the weekend. Promise me you're not gonna lift your suitcases. Don't worry. Okay, I'll put the boys to work when they pick me up from my bachelor party tomorrow. Okay. Wooh, booze. Nice. Can you make sure Binky does not drink all these tonight? Stop. Oh, speak of the devil. The welcome back party has arrived! Hey. [Kissing] Oh, okay. Thank you for coming. And I was just leaving. Binky, good to see you. You too, Mr. Bachelor. I'll see you tomorrow. Yes. Remember, take it easy, okay? Alright. Hey. Wow, there is a lot going on here. [Chuckles] I know. I figured it'd be simplest if we take a tote and just dropped one of each items into it. -Good? -Okay. So what have we got? We've got some snacks, alcohol, thank you. Mhmm. Aspirin, sunscreen and what's this? It's a map of the area around the estates, so people don't get lost. You know me, I need this, right? All right, let's get started. Thank you again for doing this. You know, with Michael moving so slowly and Melanie being out of town on a gig, you are a lifesaver. Of course. Oh. Oh, did they ever find the guy that attacked Michael and those other people? They're still working on it. God, I'm just I'm really glad that he's okay. Me too. Honestly, I can't wait until next week, you know, when we can breathe for a minute. Did you ever think I'm gonna get married? I didn't think you wanted to. Of course, I want to the right guy. But he can't change me. Because I swear every time a woman gets into a relationship, they just like flip a switch. Do you think I have? No, not necessarily, but yeah, you're different since Michael. What do you mean? Like with your friends. When's the last time you and I had anything but squeeze in a lunch together? It's not Michael. Life got busy in the last year with everything. A week turned into a month, then a few months, and now we're here. Oh, I know that you are so busy and that you're about to start a new chapter in your life. But if I'm gonna be honest with you, I feel like when you asked me about today, I was the last resort. What? Yeah. Like Melanie is out of town. Holly is busy with her kids. Kristin, well, stuffing bags is beneath Kristin. And Sloan is too emotional with weddings. So that left me. Binky, I promise it wasn't like that. You're my oldest friend. No matter how much time passes, I know you're always there for me. I mean I still remember crying on your shoulder at my parents' funeral. I thought you forgot how close we were. Of course not. And I'm here for you, too. Always. Come here. Any man would be lucky to call you his wife. My god, when did we get so serious? Oh my god, can we change the channel? Ooh, and talk about tomorrow night. Oh boy. Oh boy is right. I can't wait for you to see this house that I got. It is so sick and we're about to get turned up. Anyone knows how to party it's you. Oh, and this is gonna be a party you'll never forget. Wow. How did Binky find this place? I guess it's been on a bunch of dating shows. Of course it has. Oh, I guess we're the last ones to arrive. Oh, it's Michael. You can go on in. Okay, I'll see you inside. Tell him to behave himself. Checking up on me already? Any bridesmaids brawls yet? It's their last night all hanging out together. I think everyone can make peace for one night. [Indistinct conversation] Can or will? [Indistinct conversation] Yeah, hang on. Hang on. I'll be I got you. Sounds like they're raring to go. Yeah, they're even more excited for my bachelor party than I am. I mean, I know the feeling. By the way, det. Weaver called. They arrested someone for all those muggings. That's great. Do you have to go in to see if you can identify him? Well, that's the thing, they don't think it's the same person that attacked me. Why not? Well, I guess this guy always pulled a gun on people when he robbed them. He never beat anyone up or slash their tires, so so they think it was somebody else? Yeah, plus the guy they arrested was built like a linebacker. Whoever attacked me was pretty small, so yes, one second. I'll listen, baby, I got to go. So have fun tonight, just not too much fun, okay? Hey, tell your boys if they're hung over at that rehearsal tomorrow, they'll be hell to pay. [Laughing] No promises. I love you, baby. I love you, too. [Indistinct chattering] Jess should be here any moment. She's just right outside. [Screaming and laughing] She's here! Yes, girl. All right, to Jess, in our infamous night of trouble. [Screaming and laughing] [Indiscernible speech] Jess, we love you. Ready? [Melanie] Ooh, ooh. Hoo! Oh, all right. Way to go. -How about another? -Yes! [Melanie] Yeah. Bride goes first. [Sloan] Drink up, wooh. Yes, pour it up. Let's do this. Come on, come on. [Cheering] [Indistinct conversation] Okay, Mel. Go Mel. Go Mel. [Laughing] Ooh. I'm gonna go get it. Yowsa, yowsa. Oh no, really? Holly? Ooh. They're here. Can't take it. It's good. Later, maybe later. I understand, officer. Right this way. Are you Ms. Curtis? Yeah, yeah. I have something to tell you. What is it? Or how about I show you? [Screaming and laughing] Sorry, I had to. We figured you already had a hot guy, so we would just mix it up a bit. [Laughing] I'm gonna kill you. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. [Screaming] [Indiscernible speech] [Cheering] [Sloan] Oh yeah, chin out, chin out! [Indistinct chatter] [Sloan] Woooh. [Indistinct chatter] Oh my god. No, no, no, no. Oh yeah. [Screaming and laughing] [Indistinct speech] [Sloan] This is your time. This is your moment. Hey. Hey, officer. Where are you? Hello. Ugh, god, he better not be ghosting me. Where are you? I'm coming. Officer. Ugh. This really old guy standing me up? Whatever. [Person shushes] Officer, is that you? [Screaming] Help! Help! Wake up! Help! Help me! Help me! Guys, please! Who is that? I think it's Binky. Where is it coming from? Help! Oh my god. What, what's happening? What is going on? Someone's out there. Who, who? They were chasing me. [Indistinct speech] Wait, wait. I swear. Breathe. What is everyone doing? What? Who's out there? The door is locked, don't worry. Just relax. -I swear, you guys. -[Jessica] Relax. There's somebody outside. [Jessica] Did you see the face? [Melissa] We have to call somebody. -[Melissa] Get her some water. -[Jessica] Call someone. [Jessica] Call someone. [Melissa] Jessica, get your phone. Somebody call somebody. Call the cops. Give me a phone. Binky, it's gonna be okay. Just breathe, okay? You're safe. And his face was like, totally blank. Yeah, just like a black hole. I see. We contacted that stripper. He was at another party when you said all this went down. He also said that he didn't leave any notes. I don't think that he would have had the endurance to chase after you anyways, Binky. And you don't know where that note went? No, I left it on the counter, but it's not there. And nobody saw this person? There was someone outside. And I'm guessing you all had a lot to drink tonight. Okay, I still know what I saw. Listen, I understand you're spooked after what happened to Michael. [Det. Weaver] And I'm glad you called. But we didn't find any evidence outside. And there's not much I can do at this point. But since you're worried, I would suggest you cut this visit short. We were gonna leave first thing in the morning anyways. We have the wedding rehearsal to go get ready for over at Chandler estate. There you have it. If there's anything weird that happens again, don't hesitate to call me. Have a good night, ladies. She obviously doesn't believe me. I believe you. You do. There may not be enough evidence, but you weren't drunk enough to imagine something like that. Thanks. I'm exhausted. You should go to sleep for a few hours before we have to leave. The rest of us can get ready while we pack up. No, I'm exhausted by everything. I've spoken to more cops and doctors in these past few weeks than I have in my entire life. Listen, we're all running on fumes right now. I think we just need to take a breath. A deep breath won't fix this. Someone's doing this on purpose. I just don't understand why someone would have it out for us. I don't know. But it has to be someone that's close to me and knows about the wedding and knows about our plans because something bad has happened every step of the way. Well, it definitely wasn't me. I was the one just chased by a crazy person outside. [Scoffs] I tried to warn you. Bridesmaids can't be trusted. It happened to me and now it's happening to you. Not this again. Oh my god. Sloan, where were you earlier. When? When the rest of us found Binky. I was with all of you. No, no, you suddenly materialized. I was asleep in the back room. I heard a noise so I came out, but I thought you guys were partying or something. Partying or something? I was literally screaming for my life, Sloan. Oh my god. You never had your perfect wedding, and now you don't want anyone else to have it either. No, that's not true. Wait, do you think that Sloan is the one that chased you? [Binky] Yeah. She could be. That's outrageous. You have all had it out for me from the get-go. You think I'm some evil mastermind, huh? You think I'm the one who attacked Michael, right? Jess, say something. Say something! You're scaring me. All right, if I'm scaring you so much, I'll leave. But somebody here knows what's going on. I'm so sorry, Jess. I can't believe it's come to this. How did this happen? Should we call that detective back? She didn't believe Binky in the first place, she's not gonna believe her now. I hate to say it, but Kristin is right. I think we should all just get some rest. All right. Holler if you need anything. Thank you. Some people have a darkness inside of them. I know you didn't wanna see it. You're right. I don't. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Indistinct chatter] Are you okay? I am now. Break it up, break it up. That's the spirit, let's have some fun this weekend. Let's have fun. [Laughing] Party time. [Michael] Yes, it is. Tomorrow is the big day, ladies. Are we all ready for the last run through? Do we have next to Jessica, we have Melanie, and Binky, and Sloan. Where's there's been a change of plans. Sloan can't make it to the wedding. She's sick. Oh, that's too bad. So now we have one more groomsmen than bridesmaids. Should we have one of the groomsmen walked down the aisle solo? How does that sound? Good? That sounds great. Fantastic. I'll go check on the gentlemen and we'll get started. I can't get it out of my head. What's that? The way Sloan was last night, full of rage. I didn't recognize her. I don't know what happened, but she wouldn't dare come here. And in 24 hours this will all be over. Ever since I dropped that ring into the pond, it's been nothing has gone right. Okay, this is not the Jessica Curtis I know. That Jessica wouldn't let Sloan or anyone ruin her positive outlook, let alone her wedding day. This can still be and will be the best wedding ever. -Wooh. -[Melanie] Yes. Mel's right. You deserve this. Thank you, thank you. It's show time, ladies! Okay, go ahead and take your shoes off and let's head to the beach. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Laughing] [Cheering and clapping] [Overlapping speech] Yes! It was beautiful. Well done, man. Thank you, brother. [Groomsman] You were great. You were excellent. [Indistinct chatter] [Laughing] Some peace and quiet. Yeah. Make sure you turn in early tonight. I know you need the rest. I do. So I guess this is the last time you'll say good night as my fiancé. You know, I'm kind of glad we were only engaged for a couple weeks. Just to be honest, I hate the word fiancé. [Laughing] Husband and wife does have a better ring to it. It does. And speaking of rings, I hope you like what I picked out for you. After everything we've been through, as long as it doesn't slice my finger open or explode on contact, I'm gonna love it. Yeah, our plan for a simple drama-free wedding didn't quite work out, did it? It'll all be worth it tomorrow. It will be. [Indistinct chatter] So embarrassing. Sorry. Oh my. Yeah, I it's been a long day. Yeah, I should be going anyway, so I'll see you tomorrow. -Aww. -He's so cute. I love you, too. -Good night, ladies. -Good night. [Chuckling] Okay, ladies, remember, 8:00 A.M. sharp tomorrow so that we can get with the hairdresser. And yeah, you got it, you know? Perfect. I love you all. We love you. -We can't wait. -Thank you, guys. All right, I need my sleep. Group hug. Oh, don't, my drink. -Be careful. -Your drink is fine. -I'm gonna call it a night. -You sure? Your rooms are that way. I'm sure. You don't want us to cuddle with you? I'm good. Okay. Love you. [Indistinct chatter] Who are you? [Person laughing] Which one of you is it? Which one? You thought you'd just get married, move away, start a new life leave me behind without Michael? Michael. Don't worry, you're not gonna drown in champagne. You're gonna drown in there. I was going to beat you to death, but I saw how close we were to the water, then that fell into my lap so I did what I do best. I improvised. Kristin? But everyone will blame Sloan. Your crazy cousin who just snapped when you got engaged, and I will be the shoulder that Michael will cry on. Michael? You did all of this because of him? I never thought that introducing you to him would ruin everything. Not only did you steal the man that I was meant to be with, you also lost interest in our new company that I poured my soul into. You're selfish, Jessica. Please, you don't have to do this. But I do. You kept moving forward with the wedding no matter what I did. You left me no choice. Kristin, I know you. This isn't you. I know you. Just like I said, some people have a darkness in them, and that's your problem is you can never see what is right in front of you. You're right. I know now, though. No, no! No, no, no. [Sloan] No, no, no, no. I guess I gotta kill you now. No! I can't believe you came back. I mean I figured whoever was doing this wasn't gonna stop. I had to protect you. You always have. I'm so sorry. Just remember I was right. Bridesmaids can't be trusted. [Laughing] It's okay. It's over. But this way it looked so cute with my outfit, I have to bring it everywhere. The sun's not flying around. So you're not moving back? Not yet. We love San Diego but that doesn't mean I don't miss you, guys. We miss you. Maybe that's why we all started hanging out more. It makes us feel like we're conjuring you up or something. I always knew you'd all eventually jell. Yeah, it only took us a few traumatic experiences to make it happen. [Chuckling] All right, ladies, I have an announcement to make. [Gasping] [Sloan] Oh my gosh, Binky. Binky, I didn't even know you were dating anyone. I know, we just met on that series I just wrapped. They locked us in a room and boom, it was love at first sight. So when is the wedding? It was two weeks ago in Vegas. We eloped as soon as we got thrown out of the house. We did the drive-thru chapel just like Jess and Mike did. Well, you all know that wasn't our first plan, but things obviously changed. So are you guys doing a reception or anything? No. So Sloan relax. No weddings and no bridesmaids. But I did have something that I wanted to ask you, guys. It's kind of a big deal. Uh-oh. Is it too late for a bachelorette party? [Screaming] You're getting married. You're getting married. Ooh, Binky is off the market! [Cheering] Love you. And I can't promise anything. [Melanie] Nobody is gonna sabotage your wedding, right?
