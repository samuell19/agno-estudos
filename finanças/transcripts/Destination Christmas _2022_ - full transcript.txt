Bah, humbug! Surprise! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone. Thanks to your hard work, Tinsel Toys had record-breaking sales this year. Now, I know that everyone here certainly helped us reach that milestone, but we're really here to recognize our senior VP, Emma Warner, for her tireless efforts. Merry Christmas! You know, you are responsible for the success of our most popular toy ever, K-Pop Panda! Second-best selling toy this Christmas. Second-best... This is the first time in the last three years that we've come close to toppling that dang Buddy-Build-It. Santa is putting a nice Christmas bonus under your tree. Merry Christmas! Thank you for that. Come on, Emma. Let's raise a glass. Here's to a fantastic year. Merry Christmas! Cheers. Alright, team, let's get to that Christmas party. Hey! I heard about the office Christmas bonuses. It's the end-of-year bonuses. And I know exactly how I'm gonna spend mine. Okay, why do we have to add Christmas to the end of everything? - Christmas sweater... - Christmas toys... Christmas shopping... A beard trimmer for Uncle Nick and a Buddy-Build-It for my little nephew. What did you say? That is our number-one competitor. That's the product that I've been trying to outsell for the last three years! So, we came in second. That's still really good. No, that is not really good. Second place is like being the first place loser. Well, there's always next year. I heard that the doll's designer, Fletcher Morgan, left the company. Buddy-Build-It? How the heck does a wooden toy outsell us? Does anybody care about saving the rainforest anymore? Actually, Buddy-Build-It is made from 100 % refurbished wood and 10 % of sales go towards reforestation. Hmm. Okay, boss. What's wrong? I just, I need a break. Then let's go to the office Christmas party! No, no, listen... There's a petting zoo with a reindeer. I need a break from Christmas. Oh. We have Christmas marketing, Christmas sales projections, Christmas... Parties? Revenue forecasts. Yes, parties! I... I used to really love Christmas as a child. But working here, it's Christmas 24-7. And I don't even have anyone to spend it with. You can spend it with me! You know what, I want to go to a resort. Why don't you get on that? Tropical resort. Yes! Like, a family resort. No, no, no. Like a singles resort. I want hot men. Yes. I want cold drinks. And absolutely, positively no Christmas. - Okay. - Okay. When do you want to leave? How's tomorrow sound? Sounds like you're in a hurry. Abs... olutely. Mom, yes... Of course I didn't forget about Christmas. No, I... No, it won't be a plus one this year. Again. Oh! Just one second. Uh, in fact, it won't even be... It's zero, because I'm headed on a vacation. Yeah, I... Where am I going? Um... I'm going to halo... Halo-waii... The Virgin Islands? St. John! Yes, the Caribbean. Yes, Mom. I'll be alone, again. Okay, can I just call you on Christmas morning? I love you. Okay, bye. I booked you on a direct flight to St. John, Virgin Islands, yeah. And the best part... "Skip the Yuletide. We have high tide!" I love this. - Good job. - Yes! - Nailed it? - Nailed it. Oh, excuse me. I think this is my seat. Sorry, appreciate it. Thanks. Oh, nice window seat. Good morning, passengers. This is your captain speaking. Let's all sit back and enjoy your flight to St. John. Welcome to St. John, everyone. Looks like you're in for a white Christmas. What, white? Uh, excuse me! Excuse me, hi. I'm actually supposed to be on a direct flight. Oh! Uh, yes ma'am. That was a direct flight. Oh. Okay, so the plane was detoured or something? Because I'm actually supposed to be in St. John. Well, you are in St. John. Uh, no. I'm not. It says here St. John... Yeah, there it is. Welcome to St. John, Alaska! Alaska? I'm in Alaska? Yeah. Oh. Okay, yeah. No, that's fine. There's been a slight mistake. A huge mistake, actually. So, I will just go ahead and get on the next flight back to Chicago, or anywhere. I'm sorry, ma'am. There are no more flights departing today. To Chicago? Anywhere. That's we here call a real snow palooza out there. And tomorrow? So, it's gonna depend if it stops snowing or if the runway gets plowed and if Jerry, the snowplow driver, is working. And if the plow gets fixed, if the plow arrives on time. Did... And if it... It depends if it stops snowing. I'm sorry, just hold a second here. Did you just laugh? Is that funny to you? Do you find this funny? Is this just funny to everyone? No, no, I don't... I mean, it's almost as funny as somebody showing up to Alaska in December with flip-flops, but... Flip-flops? Excuse me, these are designer sandals. Thank you very much. Oh, designers, I... Are they designed for minus 20? No, they're not. They're designed for the beach. Yeah, the beach. St. John, Caribbean. Hey now, that's funny. Hey! Hey, Tanya, welcome back. Oh, it's good to be back, Connor. Fresh from our garden in Florida. Oh, thank you! Did... you just say that you left Florida for the North Pole? Ho, ho, ho! She's got the Christmas spirit, too! The van is parked right outside, Callie and Anna cannot wait to see you two. Oh, I can't wait to see them. A little slice of the Caribbean for you. It's for good luck, you're gonna need it. Thank you. For nothing. Really? How are those designers holding up? Oh! Hi. Seriously though, this weather's not something that you want to fool around with. Can I give you a ride? Um, I'm waiting for a taxi, thanks. Well, there's one and you missed it and you're gonna be an ice sculpture when it gets back. There's just one taxi? You're kidding me. Oh, what are you doing? 15 minutes in this and you'll get frostbite. Skin goes hard, blisters. Blisters? Big blisters. Okay. So, you're telling me that there's just one taxi, one plow and one inn? So, we're the Polanskys. Originally from Fargo, North Dakota. We retired to Naples, Florida. I'm Greg. I'm Tanya. I'm Connor, from St. John... Alaska. Hmm. Well, I'm Emma. I'm actually from Chicago, Illinois. Oh, yeah, the windy city? So, you're used to this weather? Um, hmm... Not exactly. Well, you'll get used to it after a few days. So, how long are you here for? Oh, hopefully not that long. Bet you'll stay longer than planned! We certainly did our first time here! 'Course, it was our honeymoon. You... You honeymooned in Alaska? Yeah, sure did. And every Christmas after that, 37 years now. But ho, ho, who's counting? It's like a home away from home. I mean, would you look at those lights and decorations? They really know how to celebrate Christmas here. Don't worry, Emma. It'll grow on you. Kind of like frostbite? I've got it. No, that's fine. Okay. Thanks, Connor! Alright. Alright! Hey, there they are! Oh, we've missed you! Hey! How come you two get younger every year and I just keep getting older? Hey Connor, I thought you said you were picking up another guest. I did. She's coming in right behind me. Oh. I think the wheels froze. Oh... You poor thing, you must be half frozen! More like three-quarters frozen. Why didn't you bring her bag in? I offered, but she said... Let's get you warmed up, come on. Here. You're not really dressed for Alaskan weather, huh? What? She's not really dressed for any weather. Oh, Anna. Here we go. This will warm you up. Thank you. Oh, wow. It's really good. What's in it? It's pine needle tea. Anna is an amazing cook. She specializes in local and traditional foods. Oh, I can finally feel my fingers again. So, welcome to Sleigh Bell Inn. I'm Callie and this is Anna, my wife. Your humble innkeepers. Well, I'm Emma. I'm Emma Warner from Chicago. It's Illinois. Hmm, yeah. And I trust you met Greg and Tanya. Mm-hmm, yeah. And my very annoying brother, Connor. Yes, he is annoying. Mm-hmm. He gets better once you get to know him. Callie, I'm gonna have to get Greg and Tanya upstairs to their room and then, I'm gonna make dinner. Thank you, Anna. Okay, then. See you at dinner, Emma. Oh, you're absolutely gonna fall in love with the place! So, Emma, how long will you be staying with us? Uh, actually, I'm not sure. Actually, Callie, Emma kind of messed up her travel plans. Uh... it was a minor booking issue. She didn't mean to fly into St. John. No, I did mean to fly into St. John. Different St. John. Totally different St. John. No beautiful white snow. Beautiful white sand. Crystal clear waters. Crystal clear skies and brisk mountain air. Warm sea breezes. Amazing bonfires on the beaches. Bonfires on frozen lakes and warm, friendly ladies. There was gonna be hot, real men. Okay, cool. Now that we've got that cleared up... You're just gonna love this room. It's so cute. The "Candy Cane Sweet". Oh, the... Wow. Where would you like me to put your bag? Oh! Uh, you can just throw it on the sofa. It's a... lot of candy canes. It's all-inclusive. It's all the candy canes you can eat. Uh, we'll let you get settled. Dinner's at six o'clock. Thank you, Callie. Thank you for making me feel so, so welcome. Of course, our guests are like family here, right? Uh, not another sister. What... Okay, just ignore him. You got it... Sis. Hey, like family already. Uh, we'll see you in a bit. Nice touch. No service? What... What? No, no, there's got to be something. Please, please, Wifi... "Sleighbellin"! Password? Of course. Candy cane. How do you spell candy cane? It's not candy cane? Just need to hear the weather. Oh! That's cool. No, no, no! Shh, shh! No! Okay. Uh, excuse me? Sorry to interrupt. I did not get your Wifi code. It's Christmas. Sorry? - Christmas. - Christmas, Christmas. - You heard of Christmas? - Yeah, mm-hmm. 247. Christmas247? Mm-hmm. Of course. Thanks. That's us, Christmas all year round! I hope everyone's hungry! I'm making maple-glazed Arctic char and oyster leaf. Wow, one of my faves! - Can't find that on the beach. - No. That does sound pretty good, but I've had a long, long day. So maybe I'll just take a side salad. Maybe a glass of red. If you don't mind just sending it up to my room. Thanks. Oh-oh, Scrooge alert, Scrooge alert! Ooh! Uh, did you just call me a Scrooge? That's really funny. 'Cause I'm really actually not a Scrooge. In fact, I oversaw development for the second-best-selling toy this Christmas. Can you believe that? Yeah, okay. We'll bring that right up. I'll grab that salad. I'll get the wine. I'll try to find the three ghosts. Emma! I... I'm so, so sorry. I knew that you were in a hurry and when I saw a direct flight to St. John, I just assumed... Assumed what? That there was only one St. John on the planet? I mean, it was the only one I knew of. Except for the one in the Bible. Saint John, Lucy, that is not a... Never mind. Well, it's a good thing you didn't land in Equatorial Guinea! Equatorial Guinea? On Christmas Eve, they make all of the single women wear these white kaftans wrapped in mistletoe. It's like a law. Or tradition or something. Are you sure about that? Yes. I saw it on the Internet. Okay, Lucy, just... I need you to focus, okay? You need to get me on the first flight out of here and into the Caribbean. Yes, yes, yes. I am working on it. Is it... Like, cold and freezing there? Yes, Lucy. It is both cold and freezing. The place that I'm staying in, it's actually not that bad. People are really sweet, really warm. Welcoming. Oh... I love those candy canes! Yeah. To be expected when you're in the... "Candy Cane Sweet"! Cute! It's kind of hokey, but in a good way. No, but Lucy, the town is completely over the top. The downtown, it's like I ended up in Whoville. Oh, I always wanted to go there. Lucy, you need to get me on the next flight out of here. I should be sipping on pina coladas by palm trees, not drinking hot tea by a Christmas tree. I have to go. Just, call me as soon as you book something. Okay, bye. Your dinner. Salad with a glass of wine. I... Thanks. I'm sorry. You know, we can get you a pina colada if you want. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. Bon appetit. Yes! It stopped snowing. Ooh, there it is! Morning, Emma. Hey, good morning! - Good morning, Emma. - Sleep well? I did, yeah. You know, it's so weird, I never sleep in this late. I guess you needed it. You missed breakfast. I put aside a plate for you. Oh, that's... You know what, though? I don't normally do breakfast. Ooh, you're gonna want to do this breakfast. Anna's famous sourdough pancakes. Coffee? Yes, I will take a coffee. Okay... Wild berry syrup. Mmm... No, you know what, let me just take that coffee to go. Go where? To the airport. It stopped snowing overnight. I'm sorry Emma, but the airport's still closed. Yeah, they're waiting on a part for the plow, I think. Are you telling me that there's really only one snow plow here? There's only one runway. Okay. So, seeing that you're gonna be here for at least another day, and you're currently wearing everything you brought, maybe we should get you some winter clothes? I have some clothes you can borrow. I mean, they're not that fashionable, but they'll keep you warm. Well, it's 12 below, right? Who needs fashion? Let me get some of this. What did you say this was named? Well, you certainly look... Warm. Yeah, very warm. The lumberjack's here! It's good. Hi, Connor. You'll need this. Oh... Oh, wow. Anna, this is so beautiful, thank you. You can borrow it as long as you need. But you probably want to go into town and get something that fits you a little better. Yes, and I'm sure that Connor would be so happy to take you into town, right? I would? Oh, no, I can walk. You walk! Yeah, I mean, what is it, like two or three miles? I powerwalk that during my lunch breaks. Yeah, you might find the weather here is just a little bit different than the inside of a gym, right? About 80 degrees difference. Yeah, yeah. I've got warm clothes, I've got my hat, my boots. My can-do attitude, huh? Got warm clothes. Emma, I really don't think... No, no, no. Callie, really, please. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, Emma, I really don't think this is... Callie, please. I appreciate your concern, doesn't go unnoticed, trust me, but I think you might be forgetting that I'm used to the cold. I'm from Chicago, baby! She's from Chicago. I mean, how bad can it be, really? Alright. Yeah, yeah. She won't last 10 minutes out there. Five, she forgot the gloves. Yoo-hoo! Hi, I'm looking for the beach, I'm a little bit lost. You okay? I'm fine. Never been better. How much further am I supposed to go here? Well, I would say that you're about a quarter of the way there. Ugh, how is that possible? I've been walking for over an hour. Yeah, it's been about 12 minutes. Ah, well you know, these might help. I'm good, thanks. - Are you sure? - Yeah. They're touch-screen compatible. That's lovely. Look... Emma, I admire your determination, but my sister only gave you 10 minutes. And you? It was a little bit less than that. Just please get in the car. Fine, fine! Get in. My hands, they're frozen in my pockets. Okay. Go ahead, say it. Say what? "I told you so." I wasn't gonna say that. But like I said at the airport, this weather's not something you want to fool around with. It's not just the weather. There's wolves around here. Wolves? Yeah. As a guest at the inn, you're my responsibility. That's a responsibility that I take very seriously. I mean that. Thank you. You'd really protect me from wolves? Absolutely. I would hate to see Anna's coat get all torn up. Oh! Look at these, aren't they "deer"? Oh, but I know... I had this exact same pair when I was six years old. You see, they just never go out of fashion. But look, I've got more over here. It's not quite what I meant... Oh, these are so sweet! Oh, wow. These are llamas? Yes, but they're not pajamas! These would be nice ones, but I do have... Oh! Oh, they're so sweet. Oh, uh... These are candy canes. Hmm, they match my room. Oh, perfect! I'll wrap them up right now for you. Oh, no, that's actually not... I've got a bag and I'm all ready... Do you happen to have anything that's maybe not so... Christmas-y? Now, why would we want to do that? Emma. There's sweaters over here without Christmas designs. Oh! Uh... They would match the tights. Or... Now, for something totally different. Very... This. This is totally different, right? Ooh. It's slimming, too. Very slimming. Little quiet, but... - I like it. - She likes it. This is... This is perfect. Yeah. It's what you wanted. Not one single Christmas colour. Let me see something... What can I say, Emma? You just really know how to light up a room. Thank you. Oh, wow. What time is it? It is three in the afternoon. No, it's not. Yeah, our days and nights are kind of reversed around here. We only get six hours of sun this time of year. Well, good thing I've got my sweater to light the way! Yeah! Stop laughing, now. It's because of you the sweater won't turn off. I look like a Christmas tree. Well, maybe people will put some presents underneath you, a little star on your head. Oh, well I wouldn't mind a little tiara. It's not that bad here, is it? My treat! What do you like? They are all really, really good. Why don't you surprise me? I'm gonna be right back. Okay. Hey! Do you have anything with peppermint? Oh, you know we do! Perfect. I will take two peppermint hot cocoas. Two Prancer's peppermints, coming right up! By the way, love the sweater. Oh, thanks. It won't turn off. Hiya, Connor! Hey. You cannot have hot chocolate without cookies. Let me guess, Cupid's cookies? How did you know that? Just a lucky guess. Oh! Perfect. Enjoy! No, I got peppermint. - Try this cookie. - Okay. Mm! Best reindeer cookie ever. Thank you, Cupid! Can you taste the spiciness? Yeah! I add a touch of clove in there. - You baked this? - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. You don't bake! Yeah. So, you're a baker now too? You're a driver, you're an innkeeper. I'm not an innkeeper, Callie and Anna are the innkeeps. I pitch in here and there. Any other kind of job you want to tell me about? I'm the mayor. Yeah, right. I'm the mayor. - You are not the mayor. - No, I am. Callie said that I only won because there was an avalanche and a lot of people couldn't vote, but I say that I won in a landslide. It's nice to see you laugh. It's nice to laugh. It's been a rough year. Toy industry? Yeah. Tinsel Toys. So, if I'm not mistaken, that's the company that made the... panda, K-Pop Panda Bear? Yeah! Yeah, well I see the kids playing with it. Oh! Yeah, well... We were second in the market this year. Second best next to Buddy-Build-it. What kind of kid wants to build their own toys, anyway? It's a popular bear. Do you know the difference between a polar bear and a panda bear? - Nope. - About 3000 miles. Better be careful. People around here are gonna think that you're having too good of a time. I know. I'm sorry. I've been such a Scrooge... since I got here. Well, Scrooge has changed overnight. You know, the things is, I've always loved Christmas, up until a few years ago when Christmas became my job. The toy industry. Yeah. It's like your Wifi code. "Christmas247". Marketing, sales, revenue. Everything is Christmas. And when Christmas is over, it's like... Right on cue. My boss. We're prepping for next Christmas. Yeah, no, I heard that the toy industry can be brutal. You know what the crazy thing is? I actually like my job. I love this company that I've worked for. Tinsel Toys, they're like family. And the people who make the products actually take pride in their work. That's like the Christmas spirit here in St. John. And I know that it's way over the top, but... Way. Yeah. They're genuine. I'm not the go-to guy when it comes to Christmas, marketing plans, sales, revenue, but that doesn't sound like the Christmas that I know. So, maybe your problem isn't too much Christmas. Maybe your problem is that you're experiencing Christmas in the wrong way. What, making toys isn't Christmas-y enough? Go tell that to Santa's elves. No, all I'm saying is that maybe you should try experiencing Christmas in a different way. That's what I thought I was doing. And then I landed in Bedford Falls. Come with me. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Okay, growing up in Chicago, what did you love about Christmas? The snow, yeah. I loved catching snowflakes with my tongue. Really? I hope you still have some room, then. Room for what? Snowflakes. I know it's been a while since I've done this, but... If I remember correctly, catching snowflakes requires snow. I mean... all it requires is that you believe. Do you believe? Do you think that it's gonna snow? I believe that you're crazy. Okay, close your eyes. Fine. Are you doing some kind of a crazy snow dance or something? Just... wait, just wait. Do you believe? I'm believing. Okay, open your eyes. Snow! It's snowing! - You decided to believe. - Oh! This one's got my name on it! Did you get it? I'm sorry! Did you get it? No, it got away. It's stopping. What else do you love about Christmas? Oh! You're gonna pay for that. Oh! Sneak attack, sneak attack! Oh, yeah. I think it's Lucy. She's got me on a flight. Yeah. Okay, okay, but... But before you go... Before you go on your tropical vacation, there's one more thing that you gotta try. Okay. It's gonna... It'll make you a true Alaskan. Okay. - Thank you! - You're welcome. How does that feel? Feels like I'm walking in tennis rackets. You're used to walking in heels, right? Yeah, yeah. But usually, my heels match my outfit. I guess... Yeah, these kind of go with the outfit. You'll get the hang of it, just use the poles for balance, and back and forth... Just back and forth, nice and easy. It's easy when you say it. You know, we don't have to do this if you... No, no. No, I want to. It's not very often you get to feel what a real Alaskan feels like. Okay! Here we go! - It's fun, right? - Yeah! Yeah, it's a lot easier than I thought it would be. Whew! Look at me. I'm killing this! If you want to, you can go backwards, you just got to make sure that... What? Oh my... Are you okay? Hey! Yeah, I'm fine. I just... Is this what it feels like to be humiliated? And cold, like a real Alaskan? Uh, no. No. Hold on. Alright. Ready? Okay, yeah, yeah. I got it. Are you good? Are you okay? Okay! Oh! Okay. Yeah. Just get these things off me! Whoa, you're giving up already? I... gave it a try. And I'm done. One and done. Where is that woman that I saw, the determined woman I saw yesterday trudging into town? She is freezing cold, wearing candy cane pants and a battery-operated sweater. Okay? Emma, it's right... It's right there. Just get these concoctions off of me! Okay. Okay. Who tied these knots? Here. Okay. Thank you. - Yeah, you can use one. - I'm good. - That works. - I got it. Let me make it up to you. I'll cook you dinner. Oh, yeah? Where are you gonna cook it? At the inn? No, at my place. Oh. Okay. Well... Not like that, but... I want to tell you something, or better yet, I want to show you something. Oh. Yeah, okay. So, dinner at your place. Wherever that is. It's a couple of miles from the inn, I'll pick you up. Don't walk. Definitely, definitely don't snowshoe. Oh, no. Oh... Look, look. So, seven o'clock? Yeah, seven o'clock. Well, you know what? It hasn't been all that bad. Yesterday, I caught snowflakes with my tongue. I even had a snowball fight. Send me photos! I will, I will. Oh, and today, I tried snowshoeing. How was that? I face planted in a snowdrif. Don't tell anyone. Go easy on those candy canes, girl. Oh, right. At this rate, I'm never going to fit into any of my bikinis. If the airport ever opens up again. Speaking of, what's the update? I'm getting my brows waxed on Tuesday. No, no, no. About the airport. Still closed. But they are hoping to reopen tomorrow. Okay, fine. Just keep me posted, huh? Yes. I'm on it, boss. Hey, Emma? You look really good. Thanks, Luce. Yeah, I like this sweater. It's not just the clothes. You look... relaxed. Uh... One second. I need to go. Ooh! Hot date? No! Impossible. It's six below. It's just dinner. Hot dinner? Yeah. It better be. Bye! - Hey, Connor. - Hi. Hi. Getting ready for the night of the northern lights? Yes we are. You coming to dinner? Not tonight. Hey, don't be such a party pooper. I'm making three sisters stew. Yeah. Mm-hmm, sounds good, but one sister is more than enough for me. Ha-ha, so you'd rather eat alone than with all of us? Not eating alone. So, who are you... Emma, you look gorgeous. Like the northern lights walked into the room. Thank you. My assistant sent me a care package from a local store, so... I mean, she should have just shipped me to the real St. John. Hey, this is the real St. John. So, you and Connor are going out for dinner. No, we're... Going to his place for dinner. Oh... Yeah, well she's in the toy industry and I thought that she might want to see... Yeah? Mm-hmm, yeah, I definitely think she should. It's time. What, are you renting out your basement for Santa's little elves to work away? Something like that. - Bye! - See you. So, should I add amazing chef to your skill set? I'll take it. No, but really, is there anything that you're not good at? Besides snowball fights. I'm not good at finding a fulfilling job. What, being a mayor is not fulfilling enough? It's not really a full-time job. But I do shovel Ms. McCray's walkway once a week. I used to have a serious job. Really? Like what? I will tell you about it after dessert. Do you like s'mores? I... don't know. Never had one. You are going to love them. It'll make you feel like a real... Real Alaskan. Okay. You need the cracker and chocolate. The chocolate... And... the marshmallow. It's good. Whoa. And the graham cracker. So, it's a... It's a sandwich. And what, you just... Mm! The chocolate just melts right into the marshmallow. Mm-hmm. Wow. Mm, that is amazing. Thank you. You're welcome. So, what's all this stuff about you not having a fulfilling job? Hm? Well, I've never had a problem finding jobs. Good jobs. So? So, you're fortunate that you've been able to work for a company that cares about its people and its products. Yeah, it's a great company. Yeah. That hasn't been my experience. It has been profits over people, cutting back on quality, cheap parts. Parts for what? That's what I want to show you. That sounds exciting. Okay, this is it. This can't be Santa's workshop. Unless the elves are on strike. - Ready? - Yeah. Oh. Do you need to take that? It's Lucy, just one second. Hey! Did you... You got the flight! Thank you, Lucy. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. What, good news? Yes! The airport's opening up tomorrow, so Lucy's got me on the next flight out. That's great. Yeah. So, did you wanna show me? No, no, no, there's... There's no point. Oh, come on. The whole point of me coming here tonight was so that you could show me what's behind that door. - Okay. - Let's go. It's a workshop. Oh. Uh, should I add carpentry to your skill set? Yeah, I mean, I just tinker. What... so what do you make? This time of year, it's mostly stuff for my kids. You have kids? No, not my kids. Oh. You remember when I asked you what makes you feel like a kid at Christmas? Yeah, of course. Do you wanna see what makes me feel like a kid at Christmas? I would love that. Do you have time tomorrow? I'll make time. - Great. - Hm. Good morning, Callie. Hey, good morning Emma. Sleep well? - Yeah, like a baby. - Good. Uh, I guess you heard the airport opened. Yeah, yeah, my assistant's on it, she's gonna find the next flight out for me later today, maybe. Right. So, how did last night go? I bet you were surprised. Yeah, that your brother is an amazing cook. No, I mean, when you saw his workshop. Oh yeah... He's got a lot of tools. Yeah, but he did tell you that he... Oh. Morning, Connor. Hi Callie. - Hey. - Hey. You ready? Hey, I was just asking Emma if she was surprised last night when you told her that... Eh... No, we never actually got there. - Oh, okay. - Tell me what? I will tell you later. We should probably go. Huh. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Anna. What are you two up to so early? Well, Connor's taking me to the place that makes him feel most like a kid. - Community Centre. - Well, if you stand under those bells too much longer, you might feel something else. Oh, wow. Those look old. 150 years, the inn is named after them. Yeah, we should... we should probably go. We haven't heard them ring for a while. Are they broken? No. They're magic. Hm. Magic. I have the van running outside. Legend has it that if the bells are ringing during a couple's first kiss, they're destined to fall in love. Oh, I love that story, but has it ever really worked? Yes. Oh! The bells rang when we first kissed and six months later, we were married. They've rung for several other guests, right Connor? The inn's built on a faultline, the bells, they ring. Must be true because when we kissed, the earth moved. Get it? It's funny. Hey, very funny. We should go. - Bye. - Bye. I really think my brother likes her. I think you're right. Shame she's not staying, let the bells work their magic. They do make a cute couple. Oh well. Oh, I don't like the look of this. No. Ready? Alright, fine. Here we go. Ah! Milady! Hello! Hi, Connor! So, I have a very special friend Emma with me today, can we give her a big "Merry Christmas"? Merry Christmas, Emma! Merry Christmas, everyone! And I have a bag of ornaments, but they're not decorated, who wants to help me decorate? Great! And can you guess what's in her bag? I've got Comet's... - Cupid's. - Cupid's cookies! Who wants to help me eat them all? Okay, let's start with the ornaments first. Aw! Okay, let's do... Let's eat the cookies first. Yay! Come on. That's a good call. Oh, Olivia, I just love your flowers, they're so pretty. They're forget-me-nots. Forget-me-nots? That's a funny name. They're named after a knight. - A knight? - One day, when the knight bent down to pick these blue flowers, he fell in a river. He couldn't swim in all his armour, so he shouted to his wife, "Forget me not!" Aw. And I guess she didn't forget him because look, she named these flowers after him, huh? Mm-hmm. I love that story. It's so sad and romantic. I wish I could meet a knight. Well, you just might. You know... Not all knights are dressed in armour. Need to add a little flair to this thing. You know what I'm saying? It's a blue dog! He must be a chili dog! - That's a good one! - And this one is a red... - A bear. - Bear! With... snowshoes? That's good, you wouldn't want him to be "bear-foot" right? I'm just kidding! Oh, you have glitter on your face. Oh. Oh! These are the forget-me-nots. Well, we gotta put that one up. That's gotta go... Thank you. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year Wow, that was so good! Give yourselves a round of applause! I should get a picture of this. Yes! Oh, here, here. Use my camera. You ready? Everybody, gather around. Gather 'round. Alright, Christmas on three! One... Look at the camera! Two, three. Christmas! Good job! Okay, and I hear that if everybody's really, really good, Santa Claus is gonna be coming on Christmas Eve. Wow! And I also heard that if everybody's really, really, really good... he's gonna bring you all a little gift. Bye! Thanks for that. They really... Really made me feel... Like a kid again! Yeah. Yeah. Especially when the kids' faces lit up when you said that Santa was coming. See, that's the magic of Christmas. Yeah. I guess that's the one thing that I've been missing. You don't have to miss it. You could stay until Christmas Eve. Be Santa's helper. That is so tempting. But I can't, no... Lucy, she texted me, she found an earlier flight, so I'll be leaving. Are you leaving today? No. The flights were booked. Today, tomorrow. I'm leaving in a couple days. Headed to Miami and then, straight to St. John, where it's very sunny. And warm! That's great. Get those designer sandals some use. Yeah. Hey, um, what kind of toys do the kids like? What does Santa usually bring them on Christmas Eve? Uh... Just little things. Of course they want the K-pop Pandas and Buddy Build-Its and the tablets... Not in Santa's budget, huh? It's not even close. Well, you never know. A little bit of that Christmas magic might come in handy. - Yeah. - You never know. Fingers crossed. Thank you. Alaska?! I thought you were in St. John? I am in St. John. St. John Alaska. No, I thought you were going to the Caribbean. I did too, Agatha. Oh, you booked the wrong flight. Uh... Yes. Oh, that is too funny. It is kind of funny. Though, not that funny when I got off the plane in a sundress and it was 12 below. But you're still there? Yeah, no, we had this huge snow-a-palooza. Uh, a snow what? Uh, never mind. Anyway, I'm flying to the Caribbean ASAP. Okay, Christmas is like, three days away. I know, it is. How would you like to be a Christmas angel? Would I have to wear a costume? No! No, nothing like that. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Okay, and you're sure that the flight is the right St. John, right? The one in the Caribbean? Yup. The one next to Saint Thomas and some other Saint. It's okay, Lucy. Thanks. You leave tomorrow. Tomorrow? I thought you couldn't wait to leave. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Oh, and you would rather be spending it with that cute guy you've been hanging out with. - Who? - The... the guy. In all of your pics. Next to the Christmas tree with all of the... Those aren't his kids, are the? No, Lucy, those are not his kids. Talk about Insta-family. You're talking about Connor. He's just a friend. Right. I feel like I've seen him somewhere before though. Oh, wait. Have you ever thought about some candy cane pants for yourself? Or maybe, a light-up Christmas sweater? Huh? You don't want that? Uh, no, the whole point of this trip was to get away from Christmas, and here I am in a place where Christmas is kind of like this sweater. Never turns off. - Hey, Emma. - Anna, hey. Um, I just wanted to thank you for lending me your things. Thanks for coming to my rescue. Oh, you're welcome, you can put them in the chair over there. Sure. Can I help? You know what, I think we've got everything. What's going on over here? Tonight, we're celebrating the night of the northern lights. It's a tradition here at the Sleigh Bell Inn. It's the highlight of the season. We do it every year a few days before Christmas. I know you're checking out tomorrow, but we would love for you to join. Oh, yeah! Oh yeah, I would love that. Um, do you need help setting things up? Thanks, but I think we've got it. Oh, but I'm sure you could help Connor with the baking of the cookies. Hey! Tada! What was that? Well, Emma was just offering to help with the night of the northern lights. I thought she could help. - I won't actually... - You did? - Okay, maybe I... - You don't have to. Yeah, 'cause I think that this year, we need a lot of cookies, right Anna? Ooh, yes, lots and lots of cookies. I mean, it wouldn't be the same without your cookies. - Oh yeah. - Uh, have you done any baking? A frozen pizza. That's perfect. Okay. Feel prepped. - Okay! Better get baking. - Okay. I'll get your coat. Okay. We're leaving. - Okay. - Bye, ladies. - Have fun! - Bye! Bye. Think the bells will ring before she leaves? Let's just hope for an earthquake. What is that? It's an inukshuk. - How do you know what that is? - Anna told me. She said it's an ancient Inuit symbol and that it used to be made of stone as directional markers in the snow. - I didn't even know that. - Yeah. Around here, it's always been like, friendship and community. - Huh. - Yeah. Well, there you go. At least, you know, they... For you, Christmas is a chore, right? For folks around here, Christmas, it's a celebration. Did you just make that up? It was embroidered on a pillow. Okay, do you think this isn't enough cookies? I think there's enough frosting on your fingers. Mm. Where can I wash my hands? Just down the hall. No touching! Toys? Huh. Oh, wow. - Ah, here you are. - Hey. You ready? - You make toys? - Yeah. For the kids. What does FCM stand for? Um, that's me. So, Connor's my middle name. - And the F? - Fletcher. That's my given name, it's Fletcher Connor Morgan. Fletcher... Morgan. The toy designer? Yeah, yeah. I wanted to tell you... Oh, really? When were you planning on telling me? Were you gonna wait until I left? Were you just gonna shoot me a text message? "Hey, Emma, it's Connor... Or actually, it's Fletcher Morgan, you know, the toy designer of Buddy-Build-it. L-O-L." No, no. No! I was gonna tell you the other night when I showed you the workshop but your assistant called... So, you're gonna blame me, right? No! But... I mean, you were more interested in your flight than... Than learning about my biggest competitor in the toy industry?! I don't think of you as competition. Thank you. Thank you. Is that supposed to make me feel better? That came out bad. Do you have any idea of how hard I worked to outsell your stupid wooden toy?! I worked hard too. Too hard. And unlike Tinsel Toys, I worked for a company that only cared about money. That's why I left, that's why I work with Anna and Callie, 'cause I quit. It doesn't matter, right? None of this matters because... Because I'm leaving tomorrow morning. No. I'm going now. Emma! Please! I am gonna get those cookies and I am gonna go to the Inn. Emma, I'm sorry! You know what? Maybe next time, you can teach me how to bake humble pie. You have got to be kidding me. I... I gotta call Callie and Anna and tell them we can't make it. No service... I am going. Going, what do you mean, going? Going where? I'm going to the Inn. Anna said that she can't have the party without the cookies. How are you gonna get there, are you gonna snowshoe? - Yeah... What? - Emma, this is crazy, you can't drive, the roads... Who said anything about driving?! - Anything? - Still no service. Do you think we should cancel the night of the northern lights? The guests at the Inn can still come. What about Connor and Emma? They'll hunker down at his place. In front of a cozy fireplace? And sit close to each other for extra warmth? Absolutely. You know, I've always loved a good snowstorm. You don't have to come. I'll be fine. Whew. Emma, Emma. It's a blizzard. You're not gonna find the inn, and if you get lost... Oh yeah, I know, I'm gonna get eaten by wolves, right? No, Emma, seriously. It's three miles to the inn. And? I told your sister that I was coming tonight, and so I will be there tonight. Unlike you. Ah! - Are you okay? - Uh... - Are you okay? - Never felt better. Can we go inside now, please? I'm just getting started. See you there! Hey! Do you mind... Why don't we take a break and we'll warm up a while? Warm up? With what? Anna's pine needle tea. Oh. Okay. Hold that. Oh. That's so good. You know, seeing you, it's hard to believe you're the same woman I saw at the airport the other day. The straw hat, the sundress, the flip-flops. - Designer sandals. - Oh, yeah. Ready to hit the beach. Can you imagine if all of this was white sand? Yeah, yeah. And the Arctic wind, a nice tropical sea breeze. And if this tea was a... What? Pina Colada. Look, I'm sorry, I should have told you that I was Fletcher Morgan, I should have. Let's just... Let's save it, huh? Okay. Save it for when we get to the end. - It's gonna get dark soon. - Yeah. - Let me just... - Whew. I think it's stopped snowing... Hey, you're right. That is a beautiful sight! - The inn! - Yeah. We made it! Whoa. That's the aurora borealis. That's the northern lights. And on the night of the northern lights. Wow. Come on, Fletcher Connor Morgan. We have a party to get to. How's it looking? - I think it stopped snowing. - Really? Well, still, they can't get through that deep snow. - Oh my gosh. - What? - I think I see... - Is it? Seriously? Anna, we might still hear those bells ring. Let's go! What?! Get in here! It's cold! It's crazy outside! Get inside, everyone's in the living room, go, go, go! It's warm. Let's get the party started! Here, let me wrap this blanket around you. It's nothing like the windy city, this weather! - Oh, thank you, oh yes! - Stand by the fire there. - Oh, there you go. - You need these. Oh, perfect, thank you. I cannot believe you walked through that storm. This is insane. Yeah. Yeah. Because someone was determined to get here. - Aw. - Oh, that was me! - That's sweet, that's nice. - Look, I brought cookies! - Ooh! Those look pretty! - Ooh! Frozen solid. What? A little too much "icing"? Come on, you're just in time for food, come on, let's go. You read my mind. Thank you. - Emma... - Connor. No, it's... I'm sorry, you go. Please. Okay. I'm sorry. I should have just told you who I was the second you said that you were in the toy industry. Oh, I mean, you probably assumed that I was gonna be on the next flight out. Yeah. More than that. Talking about my time in the toy industry... it brings up... Just, you know, it just brings up a lot of bad memories. Things that I'd rather forget. I loved being a toy designer. The craftsmanship, the creativity. I just really didn't love the company I worked for. I'm sorry, Connor. And... I'm sorry about our silly argument. I overreacted. No, you didn't- No, I did. I overreacted. I was more upset that I could never out-sell the toys that you designed. I was so determined to have the number one selling toy. I really was. That determination, it... It can work against me. Maybe. Maybe not. That determination did get us in the inn tonight. Best night of the northern lights. Ever. Thank you. Oh, sorry. I just thought Emma should know that cell service is up and the airport is open. Are you gonna be checking out tomorrow? Uh... Yes. Yeah. I'll... I'll be checking out tomorrow. Thank you, Anna. No problem. Have a good night. Oh, and if I don't see you tomorrow morning, have a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm sorry. I really wanted to come and watch you play Santa at the community centre. It's fine. I wanted to be there with the kids. If you had the hat on, and the beard. Yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Right? Good night. Safe travels, okay? Connor. Connor! What's gotten into him? I... I told him that I can't make it to the Community Centre party because I have... I have an early flight, so... You know he arrives as Santa, right? I figured that. Emma. You know he likes you, right? I figured that too. And you? You have an amazing brother. He's even more amazing now that I know who he really is. Oh, he told you that? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Fletcher Morgan. - Mm-hmm. He is so funny. And he's kind. He's really smart. He's everything I would want in any man. But? But... He lives here. - Yeah. - And... don't get me wrong. Everyone here is so welcoming and kind and I appreciate that, I really do, but it is freezing. I mean, Chicago is bad enough. Yeah. I understand. He really is special. He really is. You know, he gave us money to get this place. Helped us fix it up. Even before he quit his job, he'd come out for Christmas and shuttle guests to the airport, chop wood, whatever we needed. When he's not helping us here, he's helping out the Community Centre. You know, he agreed to run for mayor and then, he won? In a landslide. He's crazy. He's... He's always putting others before himself. And if you tell him any of that, I will deny it. Your secret is safe with me. You know, I think you're pretty special too, Emma. And I for one am really glad that you landed in St. John, Alaska. Not the other one. You know what? So am I. I really am. Um, well, good night. And if no one's up, you can just leave the keys on the front desk. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. Emma. Callie, um, you're awake. Well, it's Christmas Eve, don't want to miss a minute of it. Of course. Um, Anna is making coffee if you... Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine. I'm gonna grab a coffee at the airport. - Oh, yeah. - Thank you. It was so great getting to know you, Emma. It really was. Don't forget these! Oh, Anna! What are these? Cupid's cookies. Never want to see a guest leave on an empty stomach. Thank you. You both have been... Thank you for everything. Yeah. Thanks. Safe travels, Emma. Thank you. - Bye Emma! - Bye. Guess we won't see the bells ring this Christmas. Mm, I don't know about that. Do you know something I don't know? I can see what's in a person's heart, you know that. It's a gift. - Mm. - Her gift. Her gift! Hold on, Emma! Emma, don't leave! Emma! Emma! Emma, I almost forgot to give this to you. It was under the tree. Uh, you guys didn't have to do this. No, it's not from us. Oh. Merry Christmas. Get there safe. Merry Christmas. "May the joy of Christmas live in your heart all year long." You're here early. Yeah, I just wanted to get a jump start on the day. Is that the only reason? Do you really wanna let her go? - Callie, I... - Come on, Connor. You lit up like a Christmas tree around her. She did too. - And you know that, do you? - Yeah. She likes you. She told me last night. She has a funny way of showing it, she left on Christmas Eve. Did you tell her how you feel about her? No. No, not exactly. You two. Peas in a pod. Connor, you're always doing things for other people. Please, just this once, do something for yourself. What would you have me do? Don't let her go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! - I'll go to the airport. - Okay, I'll get our coats! Yes, and I'll get coffee to go. - Okay, okay, coats. - But what... our coats? - Yeah! - No! - We're going together! - No! No! Come on! Ah! This is so exciting! Hello! Yes sir. May I help you? - Hey, it's Connor. - Oh. Nice to meet you, Connor. I don't have a flight number, do you know if the flight this morning to Miami has left yet? Well, our computers are down. Quite the snowstorm we had last night. What we here in Alaska call a real snow... I'm sorry, do you... Do you know what time it was supposed to leave? - Yes. - What time? Oh, 7:30. Of course, that depends if it left on time, if the de-icing was finished, if it boarded on time, if the plow got fixed, if the runway did in fact get plowed and... Oh, look. The computer's back up. Thank you. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Hello! We got more toys! Would you like some of these, kids? What's going on? Uh, Christmas Eve, haven't you heard, Santa? Hey... what is all of this? The CEO of Tinsel Toys called last night. Agatha Taylor, lovely lady. She wanted to let us know the gifts were coming. - Ooh! - Tinsel Toys donated all these? Most of them. She said that a certain employee chipped in with her Christmas bonus. I thought that Santa could use a little helper. Who wants a candy cane? Candy cane? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Thank you for staying. Well, of course, I couldn't really leave the snow and the freezing cold, could I? No, it's really about spending time with people that you care about. Genuinely care about. That's exactly how I feel. Are you gonna stay for Christmas? Yeah. And then I'm gonna be on the first flight back to Chicago. And so are you. Me? The CEO is offering you a position. Senior vice president of the toy department. Oh. And I would have to move to Chicago with you? Yeah. And see you every day? Yeah. And work with you? I know. Yes. I'm in. I was hoping you'd say that. I'm really looking forward to this. Me too. And... And spending Christmas the right way. By keeping the joy of Christmas in my heart... all year long. Looks good on you. Hey, sorry to interrupt you two, but we may have a problem outside, so, I think you should... go check it out. - Yeah. - Check it out. Okay. Fix it. Ooh, come on. Let's go. What's with that smile, Callie? We got him. Oh, come on. - After you. - Thank you. Wow. Oh, wow. This is the best Christmas ever. It really is.
