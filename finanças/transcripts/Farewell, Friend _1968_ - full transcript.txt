- What's your name? - Barran. You're the one I'm looking for. You knew one of my friends. - He was supposed to come back. - Who? He was a doctor, like you. His name is Mozart... Mozart, like the musician. Try to remember. Never heard of him. Nice gun, nice girl. What was it exactly? Smith and Wesson.45. Not the gun... the girl. Somebody looking for somebody. Everybody is looking for somebody. Not me... I don't know anybody. Well, if it was me, a girl like that... I'd know whoever she wanted me to know. I'd say, "Mademoiselle, this guy you're looking for, I used to play golf with him at Dien Bien Phu." You're American? I'm everything... depends on who's paying. You're French, huh? No, I'm a drunk, and a tightwad. Good luck. Bye, Doctor. Lieutenant, if you're not gonna sign on again, what are you gonna do? I know some folks who need a doctor. Listen, Pop, I'm not a doctor either. All I ever did was to patch up some poor bastards so they could go back and get shot up for good. And now I've had it. I'm up to here with the whole mess, and with you on my back all the time. Is that clear? So leave me alone. Hey, why don't you make yourself useful? Where can I lose this? Right up to here with money too, huh? This isn't money. It's my pay. Go for broke. 630. I ain't got your looks, Lieutenant. I have to pay to see the ladies. Whoa-oa. Don't worry about the doctor. He always finds a chopper to get back to base. Then they decorate him. Huh? Anything else you're up to here with, Lieutenant? Do you ever make it? Last one, Doc. Yeah. Anything else in there worthwhile? How come there's one missing, huh? You know, my first gun was even bigger than this. I was just a kid then. I could hardly lift the damned thing. And that's when I lost my first war too. When I pick a side, you can bet the other side is gonna win. Anyhow, it's a job with a future. There are plenty of wars to be lost. Doc, I've got a line to the Congo. Come with me. I already answered that one, Pop. There'll be 15 of us... radio man, a medic, everything. But we need a doctor. We split everything at the end. And who knows? At the end, there might not be 15 of us left. What the hell do you want from me? All right, come on. Move over. You know that fellow, Mozart? I knew him all right. I used to play golf with him in Dien Bien Phu. He never was in Dien Bien Phu. - Name? - Moreau. Isabelle Moreau. - Married? - No. - Profession? - Photographer in a big company. What kind of company? Petroleum products, synthetic fibers, that kind of thing. In Marseille? No, in Paris. And you made this trip because you love music? I never said I loved him. I wasn't his mistress. I needed him, that's all. What for? Yesterday it seemed like the end of the world. Today it doesn't matter. What for? I got him a job doing medical checkups on the staff at the company I work for. He promised me. Don't they have civilian doctors to do medical checkups? You drive 2,000 kilometers there and back in tears... and in a rented car... just to give a soldier a job any doctor can do. Interesting. Who do you think you're kidding? They do the checkup in the basement - just before the Christmas weekend. - So what? Not any doctor would let himself be locked up in the basement the last night. - What's in the basement? - A safe. - What's in the safe? - Nothing. Then why do you want to open it? To put these back... bearer bonds, 50,000 francs' worth, that's all. It's a 30-story building. The basement is the publicity department. It's enormous... full of corridors. They do their medical checkups here in the conference room. The strong room is just next door. How was Mozart going to get in? The door is electrically controlled. I have diagrams of all the switches and circuits. - Was it all right, sir? - Perfect. What about the safe? There's a seven-figure combination... we figured out the way to get it. Who's we, Mozart and you? Both of us. I've been personnel director here for 10 years. I had six others before you, Dr. Barran. You're the youngest one yet. That's all in your favor. Between 30 and 40 are the best working years of a man's life. Your predecessors were all too slow, Dr. Barran. This company employs 300 people... five minutes each, six a half hour, 12 an hour, 96 a day. It'll take you three days... we've allotted you three days. This is your assistant, Doctor. Mademoiselle Austerlitz, our company controller's daughter. She's a medical student. What do you want a doctor for, anyway? I want to take them on a nice long trip with me. - You're going off again? - Now don't ask too many questions. You haven't changed, have you? Not very much, baby. Will I see you soon? As soon as you get me a doctor. It's very important. Thanks. There's a man downstairs. His name is Barran. He's a medical lieutenant. I want to know his address and what he's doing here. Yeah. Hey, Doc, you've come up in the world since Marseille. Not far enough since you're here. With me, it's different. I haven't found my way. I don't want to be nosy, but the Congo is in the other direction. I still need a doctor. And the guys you find nowadays... all they want to be is like everybody else... petty bureaucrats cooped up in cages. Is that where you're doing the medical checkups, Doc? What did you come here for? I could use some money, thought maybe you'd like to buy this back. - How much? - You name it. You still haven't told me why there's one bullet missing, Doc, but I'll find that out too. There'll be two missing then. I don't want to see you again. Don't worry, Doc... you will. Who's that? A guy. Is that yours? Yes, it's mine. You can get dressed. When was it you had that positive TB reaction? Last year. - Can I call the next, Doctor? - I'll tell you when I'm ready. Do you ever look anybody in the face? What's the matter? Don't you like my face? Franz Propp... my name is Franz Propp. Yeah. Gentlemen, my girlfriend's name is Catherine. Say hello, Catherine. Hello. Hello. Hello. Don't you ever fail, Mr. Propp? Never. And have you belonged to Mr. Propp for a long time? Since this evening. I'd like to be a doll. Franz would pull a string in my back... like this... and you know what I'd say? I love you, I love you, I love you. Martha, there'll be five of us tonight. And listen, I shall be very disappointed if there isn't a doll in the house when we get there. That's right, Martha... a doll. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. Papa gone. This is it, boys... 10 times the ante. I was born in Montpelier. I'm 24 years old. - I'm beautiful. - No, not that! - I don't know what to say. - You're an idiot. Well? Well?! - Well, I'm waiting! - Papa gone. - Yeah! - Papa gone. Papa gone. Now tell us a story. - I don't know where to begin. - Make one up... any kind of a story. Once upon a time... Leave me alone, leave me alone. Quickly, please. As quick as you can. 5 Rue Pont de Neuilly. Yes, 5. Good luck. But I don't even know where to find you again. You don't know how lucky you are. Montparnasse. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, Doctor. Which way is the White Zone? I've been here six months and I still don't understand it. I think it's down there. Good morning, Doctor. Morning. - Weekend? - Weekend. Weekend. I didn't say to look at me all the time. You can do something else. Hi. Well... What time do they open the safe? In the afternoon. Every Friday they put in the account books. This will take three pictures a second. All you have to do is switch it on when they get into the room - and stop it when they leave. - Does it make noise? Not on the other side. I've done what I could here. It's funny... tonight is the first time we won't be together. Will you miss me? No. Basement staff, basement staff, staff working in the basement are to leave the corridors. Staff working in the basement are to leave the corridors. Immediate order... evacuate the corridors, please. Why do they clear everybody out of the corridors? They've brought down the Christmas bonuses. - Extra month pay? - It's all the pay and bonuses. The banks are closed down over the holidays. Inhale. Do they keep the money in the safe over the weekend? I guess so. Cough. - Is it a lot? - I guess so. My heart isn't making that noise, is it? No, the X-ray machine is out of order. Cough. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't know. - How much is in there? - They say two million. That's not bad for a staff of 300. Yes, but there's also the factory pay. - I'll explain it. - Explain what?! That you were after the money right from the start? But you're crazy. I didn't ask you to open the safe to take out anything. I just want you to put my bonds in, mine! I haven't changed. And I'm not supposed to touch the two million? No. You're crazy. How long will it take to develop this? It will be ready at quarter after 6:00. Well, we're finished. I want to thank you for your help. Merry Christmas, Mademoiselle Austerlitz. Merry Christmas, Doctor. - Happy Christmas, Doctor. - Same to you. Oh, I'm sticking around, but I've already got my Christmas present. Forget the whole thing. I've only got three figures out of seven. Third, fourth, and the last... that's all. The rest are no good. 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000... if we need four figures, that makes 10,000 possible combinations. I've got three days and nights to try them all. - No. - Why not? I might hit it on the first try. No, I don't want you to. I'll explain it to them. I'll give the bonds back. If I give back the bonds, they won't do anything to me. They're all wearing gloves in the pictures. I thought of that. There isn't a single fingerprint in the whole strong room. It's a sanctuary. If I don't get out before, we'll meet at my place on Tuesday morning. We've been together for two weeks. I don't even know your first name. - Dino. - You really mean it? You won't touch anything in the safe? What are you doing here? I was just about to ask you the same question, Doc. Attention, please. Staff in the basement are asked to leave immediately. - Come on. - Attention, please. Staff in the basement are asked to leave immediately. Get in. What the hell do you want from me? When I smell something cooking, Doc, I want to know what it is. - Anyhow, we can always yell... - No. They've got them at every crossing. The runs are every 12 hours... at noon and midnight. - You'll find a way to get out. - How about you, Doc? Go to hell. Yeah. Get out of here. How much have they got in there, Doc? - Not a cent. - Then why do you want to open it? To put some in. See? Come on, it's time for the run. Number 555 isn't in the garage office. He hasn't eaten here. I guess he just stayed home. If the management hears about this, we'll all get fired. You don't stay home when there's over two million in the safe. I'm going to ask 315 to stand in for him. No money in the safe, huh? I didn't ask you to come here. But I am here! And I want half. Get this into your thick skull... we're not gonna touch that money. Who're you kidding? I don't care what you think. You can't stop me from opening that safe, Doc. You have to sleep some time. I've got three figures of the combination and you don't. You'd need six months. Ahem. All right. We'll take turns on the safe. When it's open, we don't split. Either you take it all or I'll stop you, all right? Right. I'm not left-handed. You'll learn. - How many is that? - About 2,000. Get any sleep, Doc? Terrific. Liar. You know we're not gonna make it. Suppose it's the last one. It's not the last one. I know, I've tried it. Thirsty? That was a lousy trick. I told you, it's you or me. Why did they take that? Well, I don't know. I guess it was borrowed from someplace. All right, where's the food? You put it in there? All of it? How could I know?! Maybe they've got machines in the other corridors. Barran! I'll get you. Watch the fifth knob. It's beginning to stick. How many combinations have we tried? 3,650. Outside they're having goose liver, oysters, turkey... disgusting. I had a date too... a girl in a white uniform a little penguin right here... penguin. Open it. - Now what? - There's a patrol in a few minutes. When they open the doors, we'll get out. No! I'm not gonna end up in jail. We'll wait like good little boys until Tuesday. The lights. Don't knock yourself out. If you'd listened to me, we'd be outside! If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here in the first place! Where would we be, shooting Negroes? People like you make me sick. You stink! What are you up to now? The one thing I know about electricity... it travels through wires. There's no lock, no key, no window, and no bread in the safe, but we've got... wires all around us. The door? No. I must've shorted the air-conditioning. If there is some damn fool thing to do, you'll never miss. Once in Indochina, for 18 hours, I was in a hole... full of water. I was alone. The light's going. - Are they counterfeit? - No. Then they're hot... the banks have their numbers or something. I wasn't going to keep them. You wanted to get a hold of the two million, didn't you, Doc? No. Then what the hell are you doing here? That's the whole point, Pop. I'm not here. She needed a patsy in this basement and I replaced the patsy. I'm a stand-in... a mirage. How come? There are some things we have to do. Light! Is it noon or midnight? I don't know anymore. Well, if it's midnight, they're celebrating outside. What did you say? "Goose liver, oysters, turkey... and a girl in a uniform." With a penguin on top and nothing underneath. Merry Christmas, Mr. Propp. Merry Christmas, Mr. Barran. I'm rich... filthy rich... investing my bread. How do we get out of here Tuesday morning? Feet first. How long can a man go without drinking water? Not until Tuesday. Now that it doesn't matter much... why was a bullet missing from your gun? His name was Mozart... like the composer. He was a doctor like me. We did everything together... passed exams, chased girls, got drunk, fights. He had talent for everything, especially for dirty tricks. You wouldn't believe it. I guess some people thought he was a bastard... but he was somebody. He was... well, a brother... more than a brother. In Algeria one night we were nailed down, near Sétif... I mistook him for an enemy... and shot him... there! An hour later, they brought his body back in a helicopter. And that was the night they decorated me for. Just the way I'm telling you. Well, you can't always tell your friends from your enemies. Come right down to it, maybe they're the same thing. It's like this. Look. Is it giving us light or is it suffocating us? Is Mozart the one the girl was waiting for in Marseille? Yeah, but I didn't want to talk about him. He tell you about her? He told me about a promise he made to somebody... a sort of Christmas present. Yeah? What then? Nothing. That's it. You mean to tell me you're in this mess because of him?! Well, I'm not a dancer! What the hell difference does that make? He's dead! He never let me down and I won't let him down. Now shut up! Some guy, this Mozart. If he was so great, how would he get out of here, huh? Bring the light. - What's the matter? - It's cold here, only here. There's a shaft behind it. Are you crazy? Yeah. It's the same... if they take us now or Tuesday. Except now we are alive. Go on, your turn. We'd better work in the dark. We're gonna choke. Did it make you think of the good old days? Better than that, Doc. You've got another laugh coming. Have a look. He's been dead more than two days. Shot four times with a.45. Must've been Friday while the people were leaving and making all that racket. I left Isabelle in the cafe just then. So she couldn't have done it. Who do you think did it? Ask him. If this is Tuesday, they're going to open the doors around 8:00. It's Tuesday. - Who told you? - It was exceptionally fine weather throughout France for the weekend. And now that Christmas is over, everyone is returning to work. That gives us three hours to clean up our prints. Had a good weekend? Oh, great. Yeah. Bad news gets around fast. If I hadn't been hungry, they would have got me up there. What are you gonna do now? Find Isabelle. I got plenty, I sold a doll. You need anything else, you call the Val-de-Grâce, extension 18. I've got pull there. No, you fly to Marseille. I will too. And we'll meet at the bar in front of the camp. And remember, you were never in that basement. You don't know me. You don't have to worry about me, Doc. I'm not worrying about you. We'll get at least 10 years if they find out there were two of us. Give me your word. I ain't got one, Doc. Give it anyway. Farewell, friend. I repeat, Dino Barran, age 32, 5' 101/2", eyes blue, hair brown. This man is armed. Shoot after first warning. I repeat: this man is armed. Shoot after first warning. Over. Flight 637, scheduled at 12:35, boarding expected at 12:05, gate number 12. Chief Inspector Méloutis... Antoine Pierre Mille. Drop that razor. Hey, you. Get going, fathead. Synteco Advertising, good morning. I would like to speak to Isabelle Moreau... photographic department, please. One minute, please. - Did you say Isabelle Moreau? - Yes. I'm sorry. There is no such name on the staff list. What did you say? I said this person is not employed here. Alone! Alone... everybody is alone. Me too, I'm alone. But it happens there were two of you in that basement. I spend my weekends in the country, not in basements. You were in Algeria together, you were repatriated together, you were at St. Martha's camp together, and you don't know him?! Coincidences. What do you take me for? Um... - a cop? - Right. You don't know Barran and I'm a cop. I can't get it through my thick head, but I can try. You just explain it slowly. Explain what? How it happened, for instance, this morning at Orly, that at the same moment you were both there together?! Coincidence. I know something that's going to coincide with your kisser. Hey, that's a beautiful lifeline you have there. I'm telling you, time is on my side. Take him out and start over again from the beginning. When he's tired, let me know. Don't be afraid. I'll let you go as you soon as you're quiet. You're the only one who can help me. That's why I'm here. It's a lie... all lies. Listen to me, my only chance to prove it... is you. You're alone here? I don't know this guy Barran. I wasn't in the basement, I was in the country. You go to hell. Where in the country? Normandy. Had oysters, goose liver and turkey. Who were you with, a girl? Two... a blonde and then a... brunette. And I didn't get a wink of sleep. Recognize this? - You let me sleep if I do? - Okay. It's a holster, Sheriff. Good night. Wake him up. Who shot the watchman, you or him? I don't know the guy. Who had the safe combination, you or him? You know, this is, uh... none of my business, but this man Barran... he's a doctor. That means he's an educated man. Now if he had done it, he would've planned this and it wouldn't be so simple for you. He did plan it. We got this off the conveyor belt, see? Did you see Barran's record? He's a great shot... certified. So what? So he wouldn't need four shots to kill that guard. One would have been enough. Say, you know a lot of things, don't you? I've read it in the paper. Ask, uh... him. When I went out of the garage, a car tried to run me down. Was it Isabelle's, the one she had in Marseille? I didn't see, I don't know. I don't think so. In Marseille, it was a rented car. - Mustard. - You told me it was white. Not the color of the car. I mean, get me the mustard! Mustard! You don't believe a word I told you, do you? There's an American they've arrested. Was he with you in the basement? No, I was alone. Then who took the money? Somebody who knew the combination. On Friday night when I got myself shut in there, the safe was already empty. Somebody put me there to make it look spectacular. In fact, it was much simpler... all they had to do was take the money and go. - Hmm? - How could they? When? When everybody had left and the corridors were empty. The guard had the bad idea to come along just then. But he was killed with your gun. That too... all they had to do was take it. - You live here with your father? - Yes. He's been in Switzerland for two months. - What's wrong with him? - Coronary thrombosis. How far have you got with your medical school? Third year... I mean, I'm doing the first year for the third time. - What's your first name? - Dominique. - They call me Waterloo. - Why? Oh, because my name is Austerlitz. Ah. It's on account of my exams. They're always a disaster. I get in a panic. Come here... Waterloo. Are you going to help me? That name... Isabelle Moreau... her job at Synteco, the address she gave me, it was all a lie. She thought of everything to keep me from pursuing her, except for one thing... she came to the medical checkup and had a card on the uniform like everybody else. And I have one witness... you. There were dozens of girls. How can you expect me to remember one? You filed her card, so you can find it again. I need that card. No, I can't do it. No no no! No! You killed him. I'm sure of it. You killed him! Tomorrow you will go to the office, Waterloo. - No. - And get me that card. No. No. Let go of me! Please. No. Oh, let go of me. Yeah? - It's me, Chief. - I know it's you. - So what? - I've got something. Barran was hired for the medical checkup on the strength of a note signed by the general manager. - Want me to read it to you? - What for? It's a fake. - How do you know? - What else? We've been over the whole ventilating shaft from where he broke in and there's only evidence for one man. Any prints in the vault? No, he cleaned everything up. They cleaned everything up. - Is that all? - That's all. You get up early? No, I go to bed late. Come on. I'll tell you something... something that comes from here. I think it's great you don't squeal on a friend. I admire that. He's no friend of mine, Sheriff. Never laid eyes on him. What have you got there anyway? Come on. Sit down. I like this time of night. Where were you born? In a tree. Me, I was born in the Arden. You don't know the Arden and I don't know the United States. Why don't you say what you gotta say? Something that comes from here. No kidding. It's damn depressing to think that you're going to wind up in jail for life - and what for? - I'm gonna cry. Listen, Franz... we know this Barran opened the safe. We know it was his gun. So why deny it? If you would give us a break, it will go down in your record. I'll put it down myself in black and white. And you know what? They think a lot of me. They listen to what I say. I'll do better than that. I'll talk to the judge and with your decorations they'll let you out easy. I'll bet my right hand you'll get off with a suspended sentence. Sorry, lefty, I wasn't in that basement. But I'm gonna tell you something that comes from here. If Barran didn't blow that safe, he had the combination. Who gave it to him? He had three days and three nights to try all the possible combinations. Figure it out. It would have taken six months. Look, this is very hard to do. If I can put five big coins in here without spilling it, will you promise me you will go out and look for who gave him the combination? - And if you lose? - If I lose? Okay. If you lose, you tell me why you ran away this morning at Orly when nobody was after you. Okay. The last one, cop. Well, if you don't know Barran why were you running so fast at Orly? Why? The truth. On the night of Thursday to Friday... I was at a party in Neuilly and it got rough towards the end. And I have witnesses. You're lying! That's him. Papa gone. Papa gone. - On a glass turntable? - Mm-hmm. - And it stopped whatever you wanted? - Mm-hmm. How was the girl? Too good for you, cop. Why didn't you come before? - Before what? - Before all this. Three months, a week ago, how do I know? Oh, it's one of Daddy's shirts. What's your father like? Wonderful. Why do you ask? Has your mother been dead a long time? - Since me. - He never got married again? No. Why do you ask that? What do the papers say? The American admitted he was with you in the basement. I dreamed of water last night. Water everywhere. I knew a guy once, he was in a hole full of water in Indochina. 18 hours... alone. Quite a guy. That's a lousy trick printing lies like this! That ought to shake your pal up a little. No, he's no friend of mine. He couldn't care less. I followed your advice. I looked at the safe again. I'm sorry, Franz. Nobody gave him the combination. If you had tried them all in order, you would have got the right one long before the weekend was over. Look, it's mathematical. You up on your history, cop? Looks like a date... the 18th of June, 1815. It's Waterloo. Has father got the money? Yes. How is he? What do you think, after that? Not here, please. Keep straight. I didn't want to kill the guard, Isabelle. But he arrived just as I was getting out the money. He yelled. Why didn't you tell me Friday night? I thought it would upset Papa. Of course you've no idea where Barran is now. - At home. - At home? Yes, at Daddy's place. At our place. He wants me to bring him your medical card. Very well. If he wants it let him come and get it. Bring him to the basement tonight. Where's the gun? And afterwards we'll go join Daddy and live like before? Just like before. Come on, Inspector. Did he have the combination to the safe? What was he charged with? What's your nationality? - You'll know more tomorrow. - Why did they do it? - Was there any money in the safe? - You're not being very helpful. They said Barran escaped through the air shaft. - Is that true? - Mr. Propp, were you in Korean action? - What's Propp's relationship to Barran? - Is there a criminal record? - Was there any outside help? - Come on, give us a clue. - Come on, Inspector. - What's gonna happen to Propp? I'm taking him out of circulation until this evening. He's involved in another case. Inspector, you only found one pair of gloves in Barran's valise. So there can't have been two of them. I don't know Barran, but I'd like him to call me. He can always find me with this gentleman, - Inspector Méloutis. - You've got no right to do that. I'm taking it. I'm sorry, Gilberte. I've got a dreadful exam. You can clean the place tomorrow. - You could've told me. - I'm sorry, Gilberte. I brought the paper. They say you helped the killer. - Me? - Yes. At the medical checkups. All right, then I'll be going. Police, Mademoiselle. Are you Dominique Austerlitz? We've got a few questions to ask you. Leave it. The cleaning woman is coming back. You were Dr. Dino Barran's assistant for three days, weren't you? Yes. Come in. Chief, some crackpot. They put him on from the switchboard. Wants to talk to him. - Who are you? - And you? - Franz Propp. - Morning, Mr. Propp. Sorry I got you into this mess. - See they trace the call. - Right. Switchboard, trace this call. That wasn't Propp, this is. Who's speaking? - Dino Barran. - Ah, Mr. Barran. I don't know you, but if there's anything I can do for you... What's this Méloutis like? You could do worse. Anyhow, he's listening in. Tell him to come to the Café Breteuil, Place de Breteuil, at 4:00... alone, of course. - Think he'll do that? - I'll try to persuade him. And wherever you are, split. They're tracing the call. I'll make it, don't worry. I'm not worried. By the way, how're the girls outside? Masked, inscrutable. Wait wait. Correction... not masked, sympathetic. A glass of white wine. Are you Inspector Méloutis? Yes. Where are you, Doc? Not far... you can even see me. If you move, you won't see me again. Who's moving? Franz Propp wasn't with me in the basement. Did you come here to tell me that? No. I haven't got the gun. I didn't kill the watchman and I didn't take the money. When I opened the safe, it was empty. If that's true, come to headquarters with me. I'm coming. Give me till midnight. Okay, Cinderella, till midnight. But I warn you... try one fancy step and you will never walk again. Don't worry about me walking. Follow him, but don't interfere. I'm on my way, Chief. Muratti is on the other side. - He's all yours, Muratti. - Right, Chief. Hey. Hey, now take it easy. It's time to go. Let's not go there. Please let's not go. Let's go away. Far away, anywhere! I know how to cook spaghetti. I'll let you smoke Papa's cigars. I love you. I'll pass my exams. I'll read Shakespeare. I'll learn to make love very well. But please, let's not go there. Let's not go. I need that card. I know it's been tough, Waterloo. It's almost over now. Were you that scared when you shot the guard? Why did you give her my gun, Isabelle? She was supposed to leave it there, not to use it. Anyway, it worked out fine. You've only got one more shot left. What if you miss me? What if I don't? Get in there. Stop there. How did you connect Waterloo with me? When she told me her nickname... the safe combination was the date of Waterloo. - Her father gave it to you, didn't he? - Is that all? No. I searched the apartment and found that. - Found what? - My gun... - at the bottom of a golf bag. - You left it there? Yeah, I wanted to see this through. You've seen too much. I'm sorry. Were you sorry when you tried to run me down in the garage? That wasn't her, it was me. I was already in Switzerland with the money. - And Waterloo's father? - That's none of your business. But I am one of the family. Ask her. She shot Muratti! She shot Muratti! The gun is empty. Don't shoot! You told me till midnight. You know what they call a guy who doesn't keep his word? A dancer. I'm not your fairy godmother. I'm not a Boy Scout. Go to hell, do you hear? Go to hell! You'll have my report tomorrow morning. Thank you. Come with me. No, leave it there. You two must have a lot to say to each other. Who's that? The man you called up. Get up! If you expected me to leave my fingerprints all over the place, I didn't. Do you think I'd pull a trick like that? Yeah. Now that it doesn't matter anymore, Doctor, you might as well tell me you were together. To make it tougher for him? To get the truth. The truth is I was alone. Otherwise I'd tell you, wouldn't I? Yeah. Yeah.
