Hey, Carmen, how was your job aptitude test today? I was incredibly good. Seriously, it turned out that... What was the first result? Pharmacist. Oh man, what the hell am I supposed to do at the pharmacy? sell water. And snacks. Yes, but I would have free condoms. -If there are any. -Good. The other option was criminology, I don't get it. What the hell is that? -CSI. -CSI? How cool. -Do you have to be smart for that? -Not really, right? -At least not here. -Hm. And the last thing I think I'll do is... Believe it or not, a kindergarten teacher. - Kindergarten teacher, are you serious? -Yes, really! Well, you don't have to have good grades for that. I would have to clean a lot of children's asses, but what the heck... There's shit everywhere. And you, Lo? Nothing, folks. What do you think? Seriously, nothing. What the hell am I supposed to study? Eli. -The lighter. -Man, turn off the camera! That's enough now! And you, Eli? I... I what? What are you going to study? I don't know it. I want to make money you know. Even more? And. I don't want to work for anyone... work my ass off for a few bucks. I dont want that. I believe... i start with porn Oh man, you shot the bird with that! -In earnest? -Yes, but of course not here... Maybe Miami, Brazil, Spain... To be paid in dollars and euros... and earn more than any Venezuelan in his damn life. Nowadays it's easy you just take some sloppy photos of yourself... Or I don't know, you're doing a live stream and show your ass and tits a bit... And that's it, all from the comfort of your own home. You don't even have to get your hands dirty. Jezebel. -Jezabel, what the hell is that supposed to be? -Yes... That's what my page will be called... Jezebel... little Eli's diary. That's great! Where did you get that bitch name? -From the Bible. -Shut up, that's not true! -I swear. -You lie! Come on! -In earnest! Look up. -From the Bible, oh man! Look up. Look, she's about to laugh. Damned! You wimp, someday I'll beat you. Damned! Here, take it. -Oh cool, you got something else? -Naturally. -She always has something. -Sure thing. What a question. -I didn't smoke anything. - Break is over. give me another one Say hello, you losers. This is how the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance in a solution is measured. Don't forget: the alkalinity and basicity are identical. Today we work with commonly used fabrics, that are in the test tubes... And with two pH indicators: phenolphthalein and methyl orange. You can easily distinguish them one is transparent, the other, logically, is methyl orange. Also remember that... -There was rioting in the city... -It can't be true... We should send the class home immediately. Yes, thanks for letting me know. OK. pack your things call your parents to pick you up. There's riots in the city. You know what the current situation is. Who cannot be picked up can stay at school, you are safe here. One more thing, don't forget to learn the exam is definitely next week, there will be no holidays. Go through the material again. Up soon. Please be careful. Don't say "ass". I already said that. - Say something else. -Diaper. Baby. -One... -Pedophilia. -Eins... -Porno. Two... Playboy. Hefner. Hugh Hefner?

No! -Leave my hair. -I'm not doing anything. -"Leave my hair off", you wimp. -But really. -Coup d'etat, another plane! -Be calm! Imagine if they dropped a bomb on us. -Keep your mouth shut! -You pig! Throw away wine! -Guys, look! -What? -There's riots down there! whoo! Resistance! - Not true at all! Resistance! Resistance! Resistance! -Resistance! Resistance! -Wooh! -Wooh! Alain! Alain! Alan! Wake up! Man! Damn, it's about Eli! So what's going on? She is dead. -What are you talking about? - Eli is dead. are you kidding me She was found dead in this apartment this morning! She's dead man. -What the hell are you talking about? - Eli is dead! -That can not be true? -She is dead! Not seriously? That can't be, not Eli! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven! Twelve! Thirteen! Leave me alone. Come on, stop filming. say you like me I like you. No, say you love me. I love you. -Say it again. -I love you! -Me, not the camera. -You stupid man. Yes, enough now. That's enough! Although there is no official statement yet, but as it stands, everything indicates that... He is an honest man and a rigorous journalist. Let's say hello to Salvador Grasso. Welcome Salvador. -Thank you for the invitation, Marta. -I am very glad that you are here. Tell us about your latest work, your expectations... What do you want to achieve with this book? The aim of this book and the entire series is to keep an index... A kind of memory. I think that without that memory, in a country that doesn't have one... we are doomed to make the same mistakes over and over again. It's about criminal cases that took place at the end of the 20th century or at the beginning of the 21st century, also known as the Revolutionary Period. Corruption was ubiquitous as well as the constant violation of human rights, and there was no way to settle these cases. The purpose of this work is to try to remember and admit to yourself the things we did back then and how we got into this situation. Do you fear for your life? Are you afraid? The security measures for the 2033 parliamentary elections will be stricter than during the last presidential election. The national electoral council tries to the physical voting that takes place in the elections applied for the second time to establish security reasons. Nina! NO SEARCH RESULTS SUMA FOUNDATION We have some ads. Alain, we have some ads. -Yes, soon. -Four times a half page. ALFONSINA MATHINSON FOUNDING CHAIRMAN "THE INAPPROPRIATE NIGHT" BY SALVADOR GRASSO Thanks. Here you are. -Thanks. -Thank you. Mari. Salvador, thank you for your commitment and determination. We can find no solace but you give us strength to carry on. Thanks. thank you thank you I thank you. Thank you for being here. -We'll hold on. -We'll hold on. Doesn't the title The Inappropriate Night sound a bit cheesy to you? The only tacky thing here is your shirt. -Perfect for the occasion. -Hm... Are you no longer with the newspaper? Yes, we have moved to the design department. Are now in the new building. -Salvador, they're waiting for you. -Yes. Thanks. For a drink? -Or not? -Okay, I didn't know that. All right, everyone in the editorial office knew it. No one bet you would land one. -Did you bet too? - With a lot of money. -Against or for me? -To you. -Oh no, you lost. -No. I swear to you, you lost. We danced, I was extremely drunk and she was so close to me What do you think I should do? -I kissed her. -I woke up in the Humboldt Hotel. -What? -I have no idea how I ended up there. It was maybe three or four o'clock. I was so drunk When I woke up I was in a room... So here come the drinks... - Jesus. -Izia, Izia. Ah, Izia! You are the most beautiful waitress that has served me in my life. So, so. Not just because you're beautiful and charming, or you're a Basque... -A Basque. -You just work... perfect, remarkable. Thanks very much. you give everything Yes, in any case. Let me know if you need anything. -OK. -Thanks. Or? "You give everything"? You told her: "You give everything." Do you have any idea what "give it all" means? -Oh, Salvador, really? -Hm? -What do you do at the newspaper? -Wasting my time, like everyone. Wasting time, that's the way it is. Because you like to be served. Not? You just want people to take care of you. -Don't start your nonsense. -Bullshit? What do you think? Always this old lyre, no. No, she's perfect because she does a good job. -I'm talking about her, it's not about me. -No. You're being snobbish, plain and simple. -Okay, I'm a snob. -Okay, perfect. -Well then, on being a snob. -Bottom up. I have an appointment for lunch at 1pm. Are you coming? No thank you. Come tonight and stay See you later. -Damned! Someone will see us! -What then? So what? Are you embarrassed by that? -You there! Look! -Keep your mouth shut! You can't park here! Hey! Listen! Hey! You can't park here! -One more thing? -Yes. And? -What then? -Come on, spit it out. I dont understand. you don't understand what? That shit about restoring democracy. What the hell is that supposed to do? The revolution is over, who cares? These students were killed 10 or 15 years ago. If nothing happened then, it will not change today. That depends on us. From us? From whom exactly, from you, from me? Who does it depend on? The country is still in shit. -Because there is no justice. -Justice? The authorities should have put everyone in jail but it was only one person. They'll kill you and nobody will care, sucker. Ain't a damn street or school named after you! The newspaper won't pay your mother severance! You won't win a Pulitzer or a World Press Award, none of that shit! One will write: "We are Salvador." They forget you, just like that. Like Santiago Arismendi and all other idiots in this country! Santiago Arismendi... Santiago Arismendi? Das Monster von Terrazas del Avila. Do not you remember? What kind of reporter are you? This is the high school teacher who killed a student. Okay, but what does this have to do with my book? I witnessed this shit... It was awful. was she your girlfriend Eli... Eli was... everything for me. Imagine that you only like this person. There is none. Anyone could see that this guy was a poor wimp, a hippie. a dreamer She likes every type, it's as simple as that. Everything about him was suspect. What do you like? Do you care about your eyes... do you mind your mouth That he's tall, a special haircut... Which band is this? You do not know her. -But... -You only listen to new bands. show me shit you're cold You must eat. is that her Eli. this is lolo And this is Carmen. On Eli's terrace... Hm... Elis Terrasse... -We used to hang out there a lot. -I see. Eli's living room... on tails... Very nice, the three. yes they are What year was that? Two thousand... seventeen. turbulent year. Tell me more about the monster. So you have to make a choice, a decision. We go out into the street, it's teeming only of problems and conflicts, but we must choose which of these really concerns us, one might say. -Yes? -How much... How much do you earn, professor? -I'm sorry, what? -How much you earn. What you spend in a day but anyway, let's move on to something more interesting. yeah ok but... I would like to know if you can afford something from it, e.g. e.g. shampoo? um... Feel free to laugh, but you know to buy shampoo I have to work two months. But when I do that, I don't have anything to eat for two months. So why are you still here then? For the reason that we live here and because we have to move forward. Would you say it was magic? -Magical? -Yes, being here, do you find it magical? Not magical, but... maybe you can, we could all make this place magical, I think. -So... -And how? Well, by helping each other, for example. By doing the homework, getting here on time, I strive for punctuality and you too. If you're bored here listening to a madman, who doesn't know what he's talking about, it's not worth it. But if we come here to share and mutual interest in that, show what is happening to us, then we will make this place more livable. Don't you think so? Now we see an endangered species. Here we see her shaving. One notices... Varicose veins, veins, boobs... and gray hair. You're a pain in the neck, leave my dad! What's the matter with you, you pussy? We follow the recommendation of Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz. She recommends Norberto Bobbio's book Democracy and Mystery. The government said there was no secret... -Can you put a shirt on? -Yes. Democracy disappeared out of nowhere. There isn't even a shred of democracy in Venezuela at the moment. So what has Maduro done during his tenure? As we have seen, in the last three weeks there have been many demonstrations... WiFi is gone. -Reboot the router. -Once again? Maybe it will help. -I'm offline. - Do you have a fag? No. They're in Lolo's room, next to the bedside table. And the clothes, dad? -Which clothes? -Is it in the dryer? I do not know, honey. Rather ask what his government has not done, and that is preventing evolutionary drift... Is it working again? No, leave it off for five minutes and turn it back on. All officers involved are in custody. Where are you now? They are in police headquarters, but soon after... Everyone can serve themselves. lolo please is there no cheese There is no more cheese, no life, nothing. A little bit more. Here you are. Mr Lorenzo... I want to say a few words. Not? "A few words". It tastes good, dad. Hm... Yes, should they come, so what? I have a room full of things you can't get anywhere... You won't find anything in this shitty country. That's why we have to take it easy and play the game... -Leave something! -Hello, my dear! Look, my son is here. Say hello, my little one. -Hello! -Hello! -What's your name? -His nickname is Ito, Alain actually. You said hello and goodbye. -What are you doing, are you still recording? -Nothing, I won't do anything. -Stop that shit! -Easy! What the hell, Lolo? shit stop it give me a lift I have a question. Yes, please. Can I use this formula in the first equation? No, it's about explaining the equation. The result is one. I mean I don't know... I can't give you the result, you have to solve it. -I don't think it's right. -I'm done, professor. López, please wait a moment. Give me the cheat sheet. Give me the cheat sheet. Get out. Get out. -That's not fair! -Out. I didn't find anything with children, but something sicker. No. Even sicker than with children? Dude, these videos are with teenagers going through puberty, they do a lot of shit... They're all schoolgirls. Perfect. So? how do we do it I know how we do it! We have a USB stick, and in class when he's not looking -let's put the stick in his pocket. -Exactly. He knows it's not his. Who checks their bag every day? -The old man is too smart. He checks that. -What? He's already half dead. -You saw his cock. -When he got us, it wasn't him. Okay, fine, because it's his job. He's not so smart about other things. Were you even wearing panties? Yes I did, but my pussy was sticking out the side. Using the infinitesimal calculus, one can determine how close the limit of a function is to its curve. That means... what value it tends to have. That doesn't necessarily mean it's the same... What's the matter, Alan? -Nothing, I'm listening to you. Really. -They listen. What is the limit of two thirds plus four to the power of three, divided by X when X tends to zero? It's going to infinity. Yes, right, let's continue. Nun... Can I go to the toilet? Hallo? Hello, good evening. -Good evening. -May I speak to Alicia, please? Yes I am. Who do I talk to? -How are you all? -Good, thanks... Please, please, please don't hang up. Whose turn is it? Please do not hang up. I have important information... about your husband, Professor Rafael. I am the sister of a student who takes private lessons from him. So, tutoring. And... I need your help please My little brother told me something very bad. He told me that your husband sent him dirty videos, that he has on his computer. And that he has a whole folder on the computer. Do you know where exactly? On his computer, in a folder... called "Special Tests". I ask you to check if this is correct. And he also told me that he ordered him to take off his clothes, and also his underwear, my brother should take off his underwear... And that your husband rubs it on himself and he keeps the children's underwear on a shelf, he collects them like trophies. Please help me please please. If that's true... If that's true then we have to show him. He's a fucking pervert! Please! Please! She hang up. -She hang up? -Yes. -Let's call again! -No! Yes, because otherwise she thinks it's just a joke or something. -No, that's enough for now. -Sh... Quiet! whose distance from the origin is greater, if these numbers are on a straight line are greater than four or less than minus four. They couldn't do anything to me, I had good grades. Well, Eli too. We have always been awarded. The worst was Carmen. She always got spanked for bad grades. Her father was a scumbag and her mother was a nuisance. You annoyed her so much. What the hell is that? Pretty gross. Spilled Honey. The kitchen towel. How the hell does honey get here? -How disgusting. -What happened to him? With who? With the math professor. -Do you want honey? -Stop. -Do you want honey? -Stop. -No honey? -Now stop it! Want ideas for a new book? I would really do anything for that. He quit or they fired him, I don't know. I do not remember anymore. I can't remember a lot. The professor's wife... ...lost her baby or she had a premature birth, which sucked. At least that's what I heard. People talk a lot of shit. Let's go to sleep. "MONSTER OF TERRAZAS DEL AVILA" DISCOVERED IN PRISON -Hey. -Hello. -How was your day? -Good. What are you doing? I read about the monster. -I'll take a shower. -OK. Did you know that Santiago Arismendi, two days after the arrest, jail in Yare without a trial? Three days later the prisoners beat him to death. Listen: "The body was found with no head, no hands, no penis or feet. A pointed object 42 cm long was inserted into his anus. His body was covered with bruises as a result of a brutal brawl." He was executed! You killed him. "It is said that at least 20 prisoners were involved in his murder." Twenty... As if they were a pack. I didn't know it was that extreme. Prost. Have you eaten yet? No. There's noodles if you want. Come with me man! Then you will meet my friends. Let's keep drinking there. Come on. I'm exhausted, really. I am ready. Okay.

Well, she has to get up at four in the morning every day and traipse all over Caracas because she can't find money in any ATMs. She has to go all over Caracas to find someone who buys her an empanada. Idiot! "Hello honey how are you?" No, you are the secretary. "Hello, how are you this morning? You look swollen." "Yes, my whole body is itchy. I haven't showered in two months... Because I have no water at home! But I've gotten used to it, I shower with my sweat..." "It doesn't happen to me because I'm just sweating on my pussy." Sure, we all sweat on the pussy. "Sometimes mine has to sweat more because I'm kind of dry." -Yes / Yes. - Look who's coming. Look, look! Your friend, Santiago! -A sad life. -What do you think he did last night? Santiago spent last night writing to Lolo. But Lolo didn't get any of them because he didn't have a balance. He hasn't got a penny left on his cell phone. He wrote more messages that he will send with the next charge. Who has already brushed their tongue today? Shows. -What? -He never did. Carmen won. I am second What's your name? Shut up.

I still remember the day she came into my office crying. scared. All she wanted was to stay away from you guys... From Lorena López, Carmen Casas and you, but she didn't know how. When she told me about her plans to study in Madrid, through the scholarship... I thought it was wonderful. Getting away from here was what she needed. Didn't you ever realize your best friend was sad and depressed? Didn't you ever notice? Never? Really? No. You were probably way too high to notice anything. You didn't know her at all. None of you.

How is she supposed to go like that? have you gone insane No no no! She has to graduate first, and then she can go if she wants. Yes / Yes. No, it's not about how you think but how it really is! Was? Don't give me that shit. Don't give me that shit! What the hell do you think I'm doing? Work! Or at least try, in this damn revolution! So that we can have food and I can pay for our daughter's school... While you the son of a bitch you left me for suck the cock! You damn whore! Bloody hell!

I hate this town and all this shit. I hate you Caracas! Please don't tell Carmen anything. About what? The one with Eli. I'm serious. Okay? Carmen is evil. Careful, Alan. You're drifting into the opposite lane. Request help and report damage. The front axle is completely blocked, I recommend turning everything off. Hallo. How are you? We can't see each other today. My car broke down and I have to wait here. What happened then? I don't know, any engine failure. I'm waiting for the tow truck. ok, do you want me to pick you up? I can do that. No, do not worry.

Good evening. help status? Help will arrive in about 70 minutes. perfect ok Thanks. Speak to you soon. Wow. The file has been manipulated. There are only testimonies from Lolo's father about what she said... Forensic data pointing to Santiago, but that's nonsense. The poor... I meet the doctor who performed Eli's autopsy. Come with me. To the police? What are you doing? What do you think? What's all this shit? Investigate what happened. You don't have to do this. I try to help. The key. You don't really want that because you don't want me to leave here. Gib's her. The shit is over. Over. It's not, give it to me! Give that. don't make problems Damned! Damn it, give it to me now! Let me help you! Don't you want to know who killed Eli? Are Carmen's parents still here? No, they're gone. Do you happen to have Lolo's father's address? He moved. Why didn't you have to make a statement? You were the director of the forensic department in 2017, right? You could say so. Eliana Blum. Do you remember this case? Yes I do. I did the autopsy and I didn't write the report. Just the autopsy. I just wrote down what was dictated to me. what was done to her The girl was completely disfigured. Her nose was broken from kicks. We found cuts on her head, face and shoulders... Her body was covered with bruises. She had three broken ribs. One even punctured her left lung. I believe it was caused by exposure to blunt force. The irony is that none of this killed her. She died lying on her back, unconscious... She choked on her own vomit. Eli? Please drop me off at work. Shall we go out to dinner tonight? No thank you. She's not moving, damn it! Yesterday she was still okay! -You were fine yesterday! -She's dead Alain, get it! Yesterday she was ok! Phlegm! I don't know, they just told me! Damn, I don't know! I just found out! I'm at Lolo's house. I know that, dammit! I know that, dammit but there is nothing left, we made it all go! We just got rid of everything! Carmen. Carmen, are you there? Listen to me, you bitch! And the other bitch too! I don't want anything to do with that shit! I haven't sold you anything and you don't know me. I don't know the other idiot either. You caused the shit, you... This is how we will do it. If they ask you, you don't know anything. Absolutely nothing! You weren't even here, so you don't know anything. You don't know anything because you weren't in that house and neither are you. If they ask you, you don't know anything, Lolo. If they ask you, you have no idea. But it's Eli. What interests me Eli?
