A DAY'S PLEASURE The family off for a rattling good time. Everybody's doing it. All fixed up for the boat ride. Children in arms free. All aboard. "I'll see you later." Three minds with but a single thought. "Ham sandwiches -- buttered popcorn -- cigars - cigarettes." A forced acquaintance. The hold-up at the crossroads. "Will you kindly get back to where you same from." "Stupid ass!" Tar. "How you have changed." "You have been sticking around here long enough." The end of a perfect day.
