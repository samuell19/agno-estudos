Matiar! I'll get the door, darling. - Who is it? - "Hello." "I'm from the Damgah Company." For heaven's sake! Thank you. Put some dance music instead. "On the day of Eid al-Adha, 27 centers in the 22 districts of Tehran" "with the cooperation of Fresh Markets Management Organization" "and Iran Veterinary Organization will provide services for citizens." "50,000 livestock will be examined twice and weighed with digital weight scale" "Kasra Naji reports on the latest updates." - Come in. Hello. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - Hello, sweetie! Smells perfect! What happened to this? Such a shame! They've ruined it. They've destroyed the house! Pardon me. Low blood sugar runs in the family and we just die for these Kermanshahi pastries! Our neighbors had the same problem a few years ago. They used pesticides and... And where else? Hello. How are you? You're very welcome. Praise the Lord! - Such a cute boy! Yes - Take a look at these books. But this is a manuscript! Do you have any idea how much it costs? Anyway, most old houses have this problem. Your house is very damp! They stay alive under water for two days! - Pardon me? - They stay alive under water for two days! - What? - Termites! I see! Forget about the damage, the noise is driving us crazy, I swear - Thanks for coming. - How are you, darling? You're welcome! "Hi, Soodeh, dear. I emailed it to you." "It's called card recovery." "It's very small in size. You can install it very quickly." "The steps are easy. Connect the SD card to the laptop, then go step by step." "All the latest videos and photos will be recovered." "Pick a good photo of me from the file and send it on Telegram." Okay, darling. "The video of our music performance is very important." "When will you send me the photo?" I wish you would go to Arman to take a photo. You'll need a good photo for our new birth certificate. "That's no big deal. Their photos are not that good." "Besides, the photo we took with Matiar's camera looks great." "Have you applied, yourself?" What was their web address? "DV Lottery dot..." - Damn! - "I'll send it to you" - "with the correct spelling." - Okay, sure. See you later. Don't wipe it with your shirt again, silly. Say it. Say what? What's on your mind. I get mad when I see you eating all this junk just like a horse. Okay. I'm serious. Dokhi says that you haven't been eating lunch lately. A vegetarian doesn't take pills! Don't take any of the Xanax that you bring for Granny Aziz. They have more side effects than a hundred hotdogs. "Can you come over here for a sec, Soodeh?" I love you! - Are you in the salon? - "Of course!" - Don't put too much make-up on! - "Don't be a retard!" - Don't color your hair again. - "When are you coming?" No, we'll be there by 6:30 or 7. - Hey, what do they have for dinner? - "For God's sake!" - Hello? - "Bye!" Hello? Oh, right. Okay, dear. Goodbye. Ma'am, the parquet is what they're after! If they've infested the house, then we need to clear everything out. Watch for the sofas, too. For the time being, don't let them sit close to the walls. We've used pesticides and sprays but they won't go! They won't keep quiet! They're crackling all day long! Crackling, crackling and crackling! We've used Dieldrin, Sodium Pentachlorophenate... Matiar, what was is it called? We also used Hexachlorobenzene. Praise the Lord! The glory of God! "Make way! Make way, don't cause a traffic jam!" What is it, Soodeh, dear? Shit! It makes my blood run cold! "Make way!" I don't know him. He was following me yesterday. He wouldn't dare! Who is he? I saw him this morning, too. - What's your problem? - Matiar! The Moron! Idiot! He scares people for no reason. To hell with you! Ma'am, we have a trained badger who is in love with termites. Her sense of smell and hearing is excellent. We let our daughter roam around the house. Wherever she sits, we start digging. We call it the Badger Technique. It's great, isn't it? Just keep in mind that if termites infested the house then we have to dig out the whole house. Lord have mercy! Soodeh, dear! We also have a special pesticide that needs to be sprayed through the house. What about kerosene oil? My sister's house had the same issue - I swear we used kerosene oil... - Do you have a chip-ax? Chip-ax? I haven't brought my tools upstairs. He's brought his daughter, but not his tools. You won't start now, will you? We have a lot on our plate tomorrow. I'll keep you informed. We're really busy, you know. When then? What are you doing, filming me? - It's for my own archive. - Right! Ma'am, these termites have a complicated but organized life. Family is important to them. Let me put it this way, they just love their family! In the past, when termites infested a house, they would use these demolition drills. They would shake the house literary shake the life out of the termites so they would bug off and leave. Those sprays and good-for-nothing pesticides only destroy a few of them. You don't get to wipe them all off from the face of the earth. But I think kerosene oil works wonders. What are you going to do? When clay plaster and straw is in the house, termites creep in. Let me dig in a little bit, just to see what's going on. Please, have you told Mr. Islami? I don't want him to nag about destroying his house! If it's serious, then we have to take all the bricks down, one by one. Heavens above! - Looks better than it did! - Looks worse to me! Come on! Faster! Faster! "Didn't you say last week you'll talk to him on the night of his birthday?" Darling, I tried my best but couldn't find an excuse. "What do you mean you couldn't?" "You can't or you don't want to tell him?" No, I guess he has to face a done deal. That way, I can argue over it much better later on. "He's only 11 but he's understanding like a 30-year-old!" "If you don't tell him now, the slightest communication between..." Okay, let me put this on recovery. "I was the one who lost the CD, why did you delete everything so fast?" "So what if Matiar saw it?" "It would have been the best opportunity!" I inserted the SD card. I selected the drive. "Darling, create a folder on the desktop." "Then paste that address into the software." "All recovered files will go straight in there." And then? The laptop battery is about to die. "Have you registered?" I will. "Darling, have a serious talk with him." "He needs to see you respect him, not treat him like a baby!" Rouzbeh, this has shut off. I'll get it done for you tomorrow. Aziz has been calling over and over again. Let me answer her before she freaks out again. "I'm not in the mood for breaking up and making up." "Besides, we need to have an elderly family member present." "Did you say his elder auntie is coming, too?" - "How many are they?" - They're four people, mother! His father, mother as well as his sister and elder uncle. "They're welcome." "I've done the cleaning and washed the fruits." "Dinner will be here at 7:30." "Nosrat took the food containers to the restaurant." "What time did you tell them to be here?" - "Hello?" - Pardon me? "When will they be here tomorrow?" They'll leave Amol at 12. I told Rouzbeh that they should be at your place by 6. "Okay. How is Matiar?" Hanif's here to take the chickpea pastries. He's helping him. "Leave my poor baby alone. Hanif will take care of it." - "Have you told Matiar about this?" - No. "I really miss him when I don't see him for a few days." "Let me hear his voice over the phone at least." Come on! Do you have to talk to each other every night? "Don't be mean." "Tomorrow tell Dokhi to come here after his dad comes to pick him up." "We've got lots to do. I don't want her here at 11:00." - If you'll excuse me. - "Do you hear me?" Thanks, Hanif. You worked hard today. - "Hello?" - Don't mention it. Good night. - Good night. - "Are you listening to me?" I'll be at your place tomorrow noon. Stop stressing out. There's not much left to do, is there? "I've got my hands full." - Can I go now? - "Okay. Fine." I'm hungry and my blood pressure's dropping. - Feeling better today? - Yeah. - Did you take the test? - Yup! "Peyman is waiting at the door for Matiar" "but the kid is half an hour late." "He's not back yet!" Call the school then. "I did, darling Nobody answered." "On Wednesdays, the school is closed at this time." Then pretend you're going out shopping and go to his school. If he's not there, then go to the sandwich bar. Maybe he's there, again. Okay? Keep me updated. You have high triglycerides again. Just take the damn pill. I'm going. They're on their way, too. I wish you wouldn't go to the rehearsals today. I won't be long. Did you recover the SD card? Matiar took the camera with him this morning. If we don't recover the performance video it would be tough to bring the band together. Hold on. What happened, Dokhi? "Darling, he was neither at school nor at the sandwich bar." "For heaven's sake! Lord, have mercy!" Okay, fine. Don't panic! I know where he is. You just go straight to Aziz's place and if Matiar's there, let me know. You'd better not tell them anything. They fear the worst. - What's the big deal, ma'am? - Open the door for a sec. - We're closed. - Just for a sec. We're closed, ma'am. Oh! You scared me! I told you, ma'am. Nobody's here. We're closed. He's our regular customer. But I don't know about today. Ask our Snoopy News Agency. He'll give you all the information you'll need! Oh, the guy I call my grandpa! He's a fan of hotdogs with extra pickles! He always has sunglasses on and sits over there to avoid the sunlight. I always say to him, "Hey, bro, have falafels instead, they're healthier." He comes here at least twice a day, enjoys a hotdog and leaves. By the way, when he was leaving, I shouted, "Hey, bro! Wait!" "You left your phone!" He'd left a phone and a cube. Then he took a rattletrap taxi and left. - He had a phone? - Oh, just buy him a decent phone. Nokia 1100 is on the shelf. He keeps poking his nose in other people's phone. It's not that far from here to his school. Did he take a taxi? Huh? Can I see it one more time? - "Can the license plate be read?" - "No." Hello, Soodeh. Hi, Farzad! How are you? I'm so sorry for your loss. Forgive me, but I didn't have your number. I didn't mean to be rude. It's totally fine. I understand. Farnush wasn't just your sister! May her soul rest in peace. - Thanks. - Hi! Hi, Felfel, sweetie! I love you to bits! Good boy! Matiar will be here soon. Matiar? Are you home, Matiar? Hello, ma'am. Dokhi was in a rush. She just left. Nosrat has ordered some pastries and I was... What are you doing in Matiar's room? I was looking for the scissors. "Two new messages." "Hello, Matiar?" "Pick up the phone if you can hear me." "Hello?" "Matiar, pick up the phone if you're home." "Hello, Matiar?" "Pick up the phone if you can hear me." "Hello?" "End of final message." Now if you'll excuse me. Let me just take my bag. "Have you heard from Matiar today?" "I was about to call right now." - "Isn't he home, yet?" - Not yet. "We had PE for our last class." "He said that he was starving and he was going to go" "and come back soon." "But I never heard from him." "I thought maybe he was ditching me." "Give me his cell phone number." "Cell phone? Does Matiar have a cell phone?" I know he bought one without telling me. Come on, quick. I have to tell him something. "Mrs. Jenabi, I swear I'm hearing this from you." "By the way, I need to fault something you did." "Instead of a useless headphone for his birthday" "I wish you would have bought him a simple tablet, it would have been handy now..." Okay, dear. Thanks. Matiar will be here in a few minutes. Please stop ringing the doorbell! We arranged to see each other at 11:15. He bought us a ticket to watch a movie at 12. I'm in a hurry. I have to take Felfel to my mom's. She's going to the orchard. When did you last talk to him? I keep calling him but his phone's off! Right! So, I was the only one who didn't know Matiar had a phone! "I don't understand." I just found out today that Matiar has a cell phone. What do you mean? I bought one for him two months ago. Didn't you tell him, ask your dad to buy you a simple cell phone? - He loves 1100 and so he insisted... - "I never gave him such a permission!" Didn't you say that it should be off when he's at home otherwise you'll take it away? Give me his number. "Zero, nine, three... wait." "Zero, nine, three, nine..." "The number you have dialed is switched off." "Please try..." Dokhi, is Matiar there? "He's not here, darling." Okay, you didn't tell them anything, did you? "No, sweetie." "Aziz just wanted to know whether his dad came to pick him up or not." "I had to lie and say yes to her." Who told you to spray kerosene oil here? Didn't he say don't do anything? If they stink of kerosene oil here, what am I going to tell Nosrat? "Darling, sweetie, he just wants us to spend more money." "I bet you, by tonight, they'll all be dead and buried!" "I didn't spray oil in that storeroom, darling." "I closed the door, opened the window for a breath of fresh air, just in case." "The number you have dialed is switched off" "Please try again later" - Yes? - "Mrs. Sharifzadegan?" - Yes. - "It says Mrs. Ebrahimi here." - How can I help you, sir? - "You have a parcel." If I come up, you'll have to pay an extra charge. Don't say you didn't tell me! Here you are. 45 thousand Tomans. That's too much! Who is it from? It doesn't say anything here. I didn't receive it from any place. The parcel was in the office. The manager gave it to me and I brought it to you as fast as I could. That's how much we charge from Varamin. You can make inquiries about the costs. - Hello. - Happy Eid, sweetheart. - Make sure to pray for me. - Come on in. I hope you go on a pilgrimage. Goodbye. "10 Bitcoins until 10 tonight." "If you call the police, we'll cut him into pieces." "We'll send you the account number by evening." "Start thinking about the money!" "Sepehr Mushrooms" "Let me make it clear again." "If you call the police, we'll cut his head off and send it to you." "Sepehr Mushrooms" "10 Bitcoins until 10 tonight." "If you call the police, we'll cut him into pieces." - Matiar got upset about... - You can at least answer the door phone. I was talking with Aziz. Last night Matiar got upset about something and now he went to Aziz's place. He got upset? About what? Why didn't he tell me last night? He got mad. It's no big deal. He thought I'll buy him a tablet on his birthday. That's why he got cross with me. But I can't call Aziz's place. Tell Matiar to come to the door so I pick him up... Mom said he was in a bad mood so he went straight to bed. I'll see him tonight and make it up to him. He needs to be alone today. What does that mean? He called me early in the morning and begged that we go to the movies I don't know, hiking, swimming and then he cancelled it? I told you, it's no big deal. You can postpone it for tomorrow. Call Aziz, I want to talk to Matiar. I need to tell him something. Are you even listening to me? Postpone it for tomorrow. Pick him up, this time, tomorrow! "Bitcoin." "What is Bitcoin?" "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a global payment system, similar to fiat money" "but legally, no country has yet recognized it as legal money." "Bitcoin ransom and kidnapping in Ukraine. Bitcoin was the motive behind kidnapping." "Kidnappers' preference for Bitcoin." "Kidnappers released hostage after receiving Bitcoin." "Kidnappers released an African investor after receiving 50 Bitcoins." "He's 11." "I told you he's albino." "He has white hair, and light blue eyes, and he's thin." "He went to school at 7:30 in the morning" but on Wednesdays he's always home by 11:30. "No, the school's close by." Yes, it was navy blue and grey. "How old is he? Yes, you said he was 11." - "When did they call?" - They didn't call, they sent a video. I have to prepare 10 Bitcoins by 10 p.m., otherwise... "What? What did you say they want?" 10 Bitcoins. It's a digital currency. "Oh, I know, yes." "Please give me your address so we dispatch an officer to your place." No, no, no! Don't send anyone. They threatened me not to tell to the police. "Then come to the police station yourself." "I can also connect you to our colleagues in the crime unit." How long does it take for the police to do something? One hour? Two hours? - They want the money by tonight... - "Have patience please." "Try to remain calm." "I'll connect you to the crime unit and they'll ask you the necessary questions." Haven't you already? "Yes, but your case has to be investigated there." "Kidnapping doesn't concern our unit." "They'll ask you the necessary questions" "and then God willing, your case will be followed as soon as possible." "Give me your address and cell phone number, too." "This is your home number, isn't it?" "Hello?" "Hello?" "Mrs. Sharifzadegan? Hello?" "Hello?" "Soodeh?" "Hello?" - "Can you hear me?" - Hello? "What's wrong? You were supposed to call me." - "Was Matiar at the sandwich bar?" - No. "Well?" "What's wrong, Soodeh?" "Soodeh?" "Will you stop crying for a sec?" "Just tell me what happened!" "Soodeh, darling?" "Soodeh, darling, will you just tell me what happened?" He wasn't there! Not there! "Soodeh, darling, will you tell me what happened?" Rouzbeh! "Can you hear me?" Each one of them is about 100 million Tomans. "You mean 1 billion Tomans? Who the heck are they?" - "Hello? Didn't Matiar..." - They've found out who my father is. It's obvious in the video they sent. He either annoyed them, or fired them, or I don't know. They want to rip him off. The country's mushroom business is in his hands. I bet they have a bone to pick with him. - "What if your dad was behind it?" - Why? "So you'd go to him after all this time." If he wanted to see us after all this time, why would he do such a darn thing? "Don't be stupid, Soodeh. You just have to call the police." I called them but I regret it. I'm not doing it again! - "Why?" - If anything happens to him, ever I won't forgive myself. "Why would something bad happen to him?" "How on earth do you think you're going to get all that money in a few hours?" Send the amount you told me to my debit card. Ask Arman to borrow money for me from his friends or anyone else he can find. - Have you paid off your car loan? - "No, not yet." "What about tonight's plan? What did you tell Rouzbeh?" Tell Aziz tonight's engagement party is cancelled. Tell her Soodeh's friend, Azadeh had a horrible car accident and Soodeh pitched in to help. Tell her I called Rouzbeh's family and apologized. I'll call her at night and explain everything. I don't want her calling me every now and then. "Be reasonable, Soodeh. At least call Peyman." "For God's sake, he's his father. Get some help from him." "You can't scrape up all that money!" - "Why won't you..." - Cut it out, Afra! Don't mention his name ever again! I'd rather turn to my dad after 15 years than ask him for help. I don't want to give him an excuse! I'll send you my account number. Soodeh? What do you mean they found out who your father is? If you want to help me, then hurry up and make some calls. How can we get all that Bitcoin? From where? - Find someone... - What have you not told me? Be reasonable, Soodeh! Only the police can take care of it! They threaten only to scare us! Who are you scared of? What are you scared of? From them or the police? Both of them! Everyone! Police, law, judge, lawyer, counselor, doctor, anyone who wants to help me! I'm done with relying on people. I've had enough. You can go, too. I don't need your help. Let me see what I have to do in this deep shit. That's it? What is it that you haven't told me? There was nothing wrong with the surname Sharifzadegan, why did you change it? The rumors I've heard about you in the clinic are right. You're that Sharifzadegan's daughter. Now I know why you're the only vegetarian who doesn't eat mushrooms. "Call from Aziz" Right, Sirus Sharifzadegan is my father not Nosrat Ebrahimi. 15 years ago, Aziz and I left him because of a disaster. I bet now you want to know why "Call from Aziz" "Call from..." Believe me, it's unbearable. We even sprayed kerosene oil but it was no use! Now they're chewing away the sofa! Nobody moves out in such a short notice. Mr. Islami, how many times do I have to tell you so you'd believe me? The guy just came yesterday. He says he's busy and that he might have to dig up the whole house. How can I live there with a child? I'm on a tight budget right now. Don't even think about it. Besides, I didn't sign the home contract with you. Excuse me, where is this from? It's not for sale. Well, for our convenience my father gave us only 20 million Tomans so that we rent a three-bedroom apartment. You give me my 80 million and once I move out my father will settle up with you. You have to tell me at least one month beforehand so I inform the real estate agent. Once he brings me a new tenant I'll get his money and give it to you. Excuse me. Hello? Afra? "Soodeh, we've collected about 70 million. I'll deposit the money right away." "Arman is still making phone calls to borrow more. I've also told Laleh." - "I'm waiting for her to call me back." - Okay. "Listen, call your auntie Afsoon and tell her the story of the car crash." "Don't ask her how much she can lend you." "Tell her that you want 200 million Tomans." I don't know. I don't want her to say anything about this to Aziz. "Tell her not to talk about this to anyone. You don't have another choice." Okay. I have to see her. I can't ask her over the phone. You just come soon. "Listen, Soodeh. Call, Peyman." If termites are the real problem, I'll call that guy right now and ask him to finish the job by tomorrow. But if you want to move out for any other reason that's still fine with me. Pick a date for next month and I'll give all the money to your father till the end of this week. In the real estate agency, of course! Hello? No. No. You heard me. Lend me my own money for two weeks. I'll give you the one-month interest. I'll also give you a check guarantee. "Yes, sweetie. How are you?" Where are you, Auntie? I need to see you. "I have news at 1:30." "If you're coming, I have to coordinate it. Or shall I come to you once I'm done?" I'm in the neighborhood. Could you coordinate it? Send someone to the door so I can come up without delay. "The grand prayer of Eid al-Adha will be carried out tomorrow morning" "in Tehran's Prayer Ground as well as in the other provinces of the country" "with the notable attendance of pious and eager worshippers." Pardon me, when will it be over? Hopefully, in 15 minutes. - Can I talk to her quick, in the break? - No. - "Are you shopping?" - "Yes, God willing." - "What are you buying?" - "It's for Eid al-Adha." "We're buying shoes, clothes, a lot of things like sweets and pastries." "When it's Eid, kids come and buy these fabrics and sew them." "They welcome this great occasion" "and that's tradition in Sistan and Baluchestan." "Happy Eid, we've bought new clothes." "The bazaar's crowded..." "Grant us the chance to sacrifice our ego" "so that we move from Eid al-Adha to Eid al-Ghadir, pure and truthful." "God, I implore to you on this day" "which you made it a holiday for the Muslims." "To sacrifice the demands of our ego..." She's my auntie. Mr. Amini said I could see her in the break. I'll tell you when. I'll let you in between the two reports. Just no more than a minute. Last month, I presented some programs, I had a few gold coins they also gave me one for Woman's Day, I took them to the jewelry shop. One of them turned out to be fake Anyway, I sold them and with the silk rug I had in front of the dinner table cause now I've put a machine-woven rug instead I sold them and a few other things and put the money in a 5 year-term deposit account so I could add the interest rate to my meager salary and live by it. I really wanted to make a donation but this happened. - What about your mom? - No, I don't want her to find out. Make sure not to tell her anything about this. You know how she is. - You haven't told her? - No. So much the better. Forget about her. She has high blood pressure. I don't know. I doubt your uncle has any, too. - But it's a shot in the dark. Call him. - Okay, sure. What happened to your friend? - Thank you, Auntie. - Look, I'm really sorry for this. It's a shame I couldn't help you. Don't worry though. - I'm really happy... - "10 seconds!" Okay. Love you for for doing charity for people. Lots and lots of kisses, darling! Take care. 5 seconds! "The Islamic Republic and the pious elements in the establishment" "will never leave such evil attempts unanswered." "They'll respond at the appropriate time and place." "The Iranian lioness has returned to her homeland after 80 years." You idiot, I'm saying that's not the way to do it. What then? You want me to go to the police station? Tell Peyman? Would you tell him if you were in my place? Why shouldn't I? He's his dad. He loves him as much as you do. You know well that if I tell him, he's going to make my life a living hell. I don't want to give him an excuse to take Matiar away from me. That's nonsense. He's desperate to come back. He's tried so many times and you gave him the brush off. Now he's going to use this against you? I don't get it. I'm sorry Mr. Mahmoodi. You need to tell the kids to go. I don't think I can make it in time. Yeah. I'd appreciate it if you cancel the 2:30 class, too. You should forgive me. I'm really sorry... How much money have you collected so far? With what you gave me and what Rouzbeh's going to transfer about 300 million Tomans. Then shut up and do as you're told. All the banks close in an hour. Okay, if you think something worse is going to happen to Matiar if you tell the police then call his dad! Who else do you have left to give you the rest? Come on! You're putting the kid's life on the line because of your selfishness. Are you so stupid to think that you can collect all that money with these pennies? What if Arman... Arman can do no shit! All he says is crap! He doesn't know any moneylender. If he says that he'll do his best, it's because he has pride. He can't say anything else. Besides, Peyman is the only one who knows a few notable people. A lot of real estate agents, architects and well-to-do people socialize with him. Call him. Are you going to call him or should I do that for you? Either you call him... or I swear on Matiar's life I'll call Aziz and Nosrat right now and tell them everything! How worse can it get? Tonight, they're going to have a heart attack anyway, so I'll tell them now. Okay. Okay, put the damn thing down. Where're you going? I'm sure that if I tell Peyman... he's going to make me call the police there and then. So? I'll have to go and see the one behind this. Wait, I'm coming with you. Okay, I'll pass on your request. Canned is fine but I don't think he'll agree on shell and brown button mushrooms. Yes. Hold the line please. Hello. How are you? How can I help you? I want to see Mr. Sharifzadegan. Yes, I just received it. I'll forward it to the trade section. Please hold the line. He doesn't come here. Mrs. Mohamadi? Why do you want to see him may I ask? I'm his daughter. I never knew Haj Agha had a daughter. 9000 tons as bulk or in big slices? It doesn't concern me. - "Soodeh Ebrahimi" - Dial 8 instead of the last digit. "Soodeh Sharifzadegan" Call him on his cell phone and tell him I'm here. Hello, Haj Agha. How are you? Your daughter's here. She needs to talk to you, it's urgent. Yes. Yes, that's what I told her, too but she showed me her ID card. Hello? He says he doesn't have a daughter. There's an issue between us that needs to be settled today. Could you please tell me where I can find him? Which factory is he at today? Malard or Shahriar? He doesn't go to the one in Eslamshahr, does he? I won't let him know that you told me. Mrs. Soodeh? - Nasser, have you seen Haj Agha? - No, Haji. I haven't. Keep at it! It still needs cleaning! He's in here. When I give you a sign, come inside. Hello, Haj Agha. You're here! I've been looking for you everywhere. It's obvious that they have a problem with you. I bet they have a bone to pick with you. Take a look at this video. He can come in. It's fine. It will be a debt. For a week. I'll also give you a check. Maybe this had to happen so I would come here and... "Hello, Haj Agha." "Everyone's here, when will you arrive?" I'm having lunch. I'll be there in 20 minutes. "Yes, right. I'll inform them." Look at his face. He really takes after you. Do you honestly think if you put Sepehr's name on some mushroom or any other crappy thing, he'll forgive you? And what are you going to do about Aziz? Sepehr died because of your selfishness. Now you're doing the same to my son. Well? How did it go? Did you see him? Soodeh, answer me! - "Hello?" - Hello, Peyman? "Soodeh?" "Hello?" "Hello, Soodeh?" "Soodeh, darling, I sold the car." "With what I got from Amir and Jamshid" "150 million is now deposited to your account." Thanks, Rouzbeh. I received the SMS notification "I also had a long talk with a Bitcoin seller." "I know him. He's a good and trustworthy man." "Don't worry about that part." "It's nothing complicated." "I told him it has to be done by 9 o'clock." "We need to give him a certified check for 980 million Tomans" "so he makes the bank transfer." "His name is Sajjad Soltani." "I also got his ID number for you." "I'll send it to you, you'll need it for the check." "He only needs the account number to make the bank transfer." "I'm on my way. I'll see you in a bit and we'll talk." Listen, Rouzbeh I'll tell you when to be here. I'm waiting for Peyman. I had no other choice but to tell him. "Alright." It's getting late. I only have 300 million. "I'm still sticking to my guns on this." "At the end of the day, you can't do it." "Soodeh?" "Did you hear what I said, Soodeh?" "I said you can't do it." "Are you even listening to me?" - Okay, I'll call you. - "Okay. Fine." Why should I know about this now? Do you have an issue with anybody? Any haters? Do you owe anybody anything? Anyone harassing you? Huh? No. Then who are they? I mean, do they really have a beef with your father? Or maybe they found out he's rolling in money and they want to blackmail him. I don't know. Mahindokht, the worker... that Afghan boy, do you know them? What do they do here? - Don't you suspect your dad? - I don't think so. How come? If he's behind it all, then it means he wants me to go and see him and beg him after all these years, doesn't it? - Well? - He didn't even look at me. - Let alone... - Maybe he wants to hurt your feelings. So, you went to see him? We'll call the police. They have to see the video as soon as possible. Look, I've collected 300 million up to now. If I wanted to leave it to the police I wouldn't have told you. It's not about the money. Imagine we get them the money in any way we can. What if they like it and ask for it again? How can you be sure that they'll get the money and release Matiar? Shouldn't we know who they are? No, Soodeh, we can't do it. The police can easily track Matiar's phone and do something about it. - Hello? - Can you guarantee that if we call the police, Matiar won't get harmed? That they won't hurt him? No, I can't guarantee that. Do you guarantee that if we give them the money, they'll release Matiar? For God's sake, Matiar is my son, too. But we have no choice. We have to trust them. The police might agree that we give them the Bitcoins but we can't just take things in our own hands. I called the police that very moment. It takes several hours for them just to look into the case. - What did they say at the end? - Nothing. I insisted they don't send an officer. They said I had to go there in person. That my case should be cited in the crime unit and they wanted to ask some questions. I'm scared, Peyman. I'll make a call. Yes? Who is it? He's the one, the bastard! He's been stalking me for a few days. Stop! Stop! Stop him! Wait! Son of a bitch! That was dangerous, you know. You shouldn't engage with them. Don't worry. It's just a threat. It's just a threat. They're sicker than we thought! Nosrat got a heart surgery and we can't tell him. Otherwise, he'll do just about anything for this child. No? She's found the Bitcoin seller. We just need 700 million. We'll give it back to you by next week. It's really not about the money, Afra. For God's sake, let them release Matiar! I'll bring her to the police station myself! They've sent you your son's underwear! Do you know what that means? If we don't give them the money by tonight, they'll... How much is your off-road vehicle worth? Next to nothing. Two months ago, it rolled over. Your house! Your uncle! What about all those friends you have people you know? Damn it, call someone! Oh, no! Did you call them from home? - Hello. - Hello. Mrs. Soodeh Sharifzadegan? I'm her husband. We received news of a kidnapping at noon. Matiar Janebi. It's Jenabi. I'm his father. Well, you never showed up. Well, there's been a misunderstanding. It was my stupid prank. My wife believed it. Prank? Okay, tell her to come to the door. Well... she went to her mom's place. It's not very far away. If it's necessary, I'll call her so you can talk to her on the phone. - You said you're her husband, right? - Yes. Hand me your ID card. Sign here. Hello? Hassan? Is Mahmoud there? Ask him how long he's staying there. Listen, tell him to stay there. I need to talk to him, it's urgent, okay? I'm coming. Thanks. What are you going to do, Peyman? I can't think of anybody else, except Elahi. Let me see if I can persuade him to buy the house below the market value on the condition of giving a 700 million check for today. The house is worth 3 billion Tomans, at least. What if he doesn't accept the offer? I'll lower the price. I have no other choice. I'll call you. Aziz is not feeling well. Nosrat said that her blood pressure went up because the proposal ceremony was cancelled. Don't be sad. Matiar will be with us tonight. I'll try to be back soon. Keep in touch then. - I'm coming with you. - I'm off. Bye. He'll buy the house below the market value. He's going to give us a 700 million check today and the rest after 6 months. I have to go and bring him the documents and the deed. I'm very grateful to you, Peyman. I'll tell Nosrat about this, tomorrow. We'll also give that guy a commission. Hopefully, he'll terminate the contract. You speak as if Matiar is your son only. How will you cash the check? The banks are closed right now. I don't know. I guess they all close in the afternoon in Tehran. I might have to go to Garmsar, Qom or the airport. You take a cab and go back home in case they call or something. Okay. I'll give you the money and you turn it into a certified check for him. I'll make an appointment at 9. I'll send you the address. Can we trust him? How do you know him? Telling Peyman was a good decision. I don't know. Maybe you should have told him from the start. Thank God everything's going smooth up until now. I hope that... It's Matiar! Hello? - Matiar? - "Get online." Hello? What's happened? What is it? "The number you're calling is switched off..." "Matiar" It's an account number. - "The number can't..." - Damn! "Hello I was about to call you." It's 8:30, Peyman. Where are you right now? "I'm in Qom. I cashed the checks." "I'm waiting for the certified check to be issued. Any news?" They just sent an account number. I'm going to see the Bitcoin guy at 9:30. Be there on time! "Farzad will pick me up in his motorbike." "Don't worry. I'll be there on time." "My mother, Zahra is my guest in this pit." "My mother, Zahra is my guest in this pit." "It's my Eid al-Adha. It's my Eid al-Adha." "The King said that today Karbala is my battlefield." "Ladies, answer in honor of Zaynab bint Ali." "It's my Eid al-Adha. It's my Eid al-Adha." "My mother, Zahra is my guest in this pit." "My mother, Zahra, is my guest in this pit." "It's my Eid al-Adha. It's my Eid al-Adha." "The King said that today Karbala is my battlefield." "The King said that today Karbala is my battlefield." Hi. Why won't you answer? "My mother, Zahra, is my guest in this pit." ID card and check. Wallet number? The account number of the Bitcoin recipient. Yeah! Is there no way to find out the name of the recipient? No. APQR09 2WCDR2TY Q90LKMG W098706 BPQ920 - Confirm? - It's the barcode, right? Yeah, I confirm. Sign it. Only... This place isn't a clothing store. Even if the kid's not released, you won't get your money back. These things happen a lot here. We just transfer the money. The end. "Hello, we bought this phone from a second-hand shop." "The owner said that sometimes the answering machine doesn't work." "If it's urgent please don't leave a message." "Thanks." "Hello, Soodeh? Soodeh, pick up the phone!" "They released Matiar." "Matiar is here. Soodeh?" "Hello? Soodeh?" Hello? Afra! What are you saying? "Soodeh! Matiar is here! They let him go!" - Matiar's there? - "You have no idea!" "Nosrat and Aziz are extremely unwell." Give him the phone, I want to talk to him! "He's fine. Don't you worry." "It's better if he doesn't talk right now." Why? What's happened? "Nothing's, I'm just saying it's better if he doesn't talk now." "Poor kid, he went to the sandwich bar" "and on his way back to school he saw a taxi with an open hood." "I don't know, they told him to sit and start the car" "but the moment he sits down" "someone got his neck from behind and knocked him out." "They left him in the outskirts of Varamin just an hour ago." "Give me the phone for a sec, auntie." - Hello? - "Hello?" My darling! My darling! My darling! "Hello, mom?" - I'm coming over right now! - "I'm okay, mom." "Don't worry. Nothing happened." Okay. I'm coming over right now. Soodeh, love, do you suggest using Well Woman? You have to cover all of them with the plastic wrap. My friend, Mahin says... it's great for brittle nails. I'll buy it for you. I guess they're here, darling. Matiar? Who is it? "A festivity to celebrate the end of the reconstruction" "of the houses damaged by flood." "The Director General of the Housing Foundation of the Golestan Province" "said that soon we'll celebrate the end of the reconstruction process" "related to all the houses damaged by the recent flood." "The reconstruction process has brought back hope to the people" "who are now waiting to have a house soon." "The condition is good, thanks God." "We owe it to the Housing Foundation." "They've done so much for us." "They've served our village." "It's even been said that he's going to go live because he said so in a recent post..." Get off. Hello. - Hello? - "Hello." "Why won't you answer? Are you home?" Yeah, they're here from that company to exterminate the termites. "Okay, what about today? Did you take a day off?" No, I'll call you later. Can I go? They need me. "Darling, can I just drop by to take the SD card from Matiar's camera?" "I have to upload the video of our performance for the embassy today." Gosh, I almost forgot. I'll recover it for you myself. - I'll call you. - "Okay, thanks." "I'll be waiting." My girl, my pretty girl You're adorable, sweetie! Just look at you with that gorgeous figure! Shall we go and have some fun? Let's go to her house. Hello there, ma'am! Say hi to her. Say, hi. Hello, ma'am. I'm Baggie the Badger! Look how pretty I am! I just love your figure, my sweetie pie! My pretty girl! "Slowly." "There's plenty of food in there. Just don't overeat." - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, how are you? - Hello, how is my pretty boy doing? - Hello. - Hello, ma'am! How are you? Nice to see you. "I missed you a lot." "From now on you can send your pictures" "videos and reports from any part of the world to us" "in the quickest way possible without uploading it on the website." "Just send them via WhatsApp and Viber to this number: 00447590899999." "Of course, like always, you can still email your reports to this address" Well, how is my Baggie the Badger doing? I love her to bits. Okay, come on now. Don't be lazy. No sleeping. Well done. Isn't she wild? You're leaving her there like that. - Not at all. No way. - I have a phobia of black cats. Where're you going? Come on, find your lunch. Hurry up. Quick! Well done. Good girl. - Hey, where're you going? - What on earth are you doing? Where are you going, my love? Hey, what have you found there? What's hiding there? Baggie? What's going on there? Is your food there? I think she found something here. We have to dig it. Hurry up! Hurry up! Make it fast!

Baggie! - What have you got there? - Hello. - Hello, Peyman. - Hello. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - How are you? - Thank you. I hope you're fine. Sir, the house is falling apart! - "But don't fret." - Wait a minute I'm coming! My daughter has found their home. Leave it to us. Just come over here for a minute, please. Come on. "Hello, dear viewers! As you can see..." "10 Bitcoins until 10 tonight. If you say anything to the police..." "Stop recording for a sec. Hold on." "I have another idea. Come over here." "Matiar." What's the matter, Soodeh? "Stop recording for a sec. Hold on." "I have another idea." Matiar! "10 Bitcoins until 10 tonight." "Stop recording! Stop!" "Do you have a tissue?" - "Don't you want to leave it like that?" - "No way!" "Hurry up! The school bell will ring soon." "My motorbike isn't in a proper parking space." "I need to full it up, too." - "First start filming the meat." - "Okay." "Then slowly move it up." "Go forward, without your hands shaking." "My hands aren't shaking." "Walk past this pot. I want you to film the steam." "Okay." - "When you get here..." - "Then?" "First, film me slowly behind this plastic curtains..." "then pause for a few moments" "and quickly walk past this gap and zoom in on me." "Okay, I will." - "Pause for four to five seconds" - "Right." - "and then say your first line." - "Okay." "Then turn to the fridges and very slowly move to the box of mushrooms." - "Okay?" - "Okay." "At the end, move the camera upwards so the brand can be seen clearly." "Here say your second line." "Sure." "Thanks for your kindness." "Now you have to bring your camera, dear boy!" Come and give us a hand, man. Right! That's perfect. Okay. Now turn that on. Hammer it. Wait. Here... Right. Wait! Wait! He's going to bring your food in a jiffy. Where are you going again? What have you found there? "What have you found there?" "Where else shall we look, Baggie?" Subtitled by: PCH
