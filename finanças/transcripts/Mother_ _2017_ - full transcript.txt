MAN: But mostly now I do research and teach. Research. Yes. I know, it's a bit boring. (LAUGHS) It's not boring at all. Sit for a second. Can we get you anything to drink? No. That isn't... That's fine. - Some tea? - Hmm? - Some tea? - No, no, no, no, no. Uh, I don't... Uh... (STUTTERS) I don't want to be a bother. But you must. A guest and a doctor? I mean, who knows? I might trip down the stairs one day. (LAUGHS) Let's hope not! - I'll go make some. - Thank you. HIM: This way please. Sorry for the mess. We're moving in after months of construction. - MAN: It's an incredible place. - HIM: My wife loves having company. - MAN: Your wife? - Yes. I thought it was your daughter.

(GASPING) (BREATHES DEEPLY) (SIGHS) (KETTLE WHISTLING) MAN: Then there's this one case, This was an opera singer, late 20s. Her femurs were rotated so far inward that she couldn't spread her knees more than a foot apart. HIM: Ooh, really? - Thank you. - MOTHER: You've upgraded. - Where'd that come from? - I always carry a supply. I never tasted something like this. It's hard to come by. I had to share. Won't you join? Mmm. She's not much of a drinker. I drink. Here, let me put a little in your tea. I'm fine with tea, thank you. (HIM CHUCKLES) The good doctor here is about to publish a major paper. "About" is generous. I still have reams of research to write up. And he's moved here to finish it. And... And what brings you to us? Well, they told me I could find a room here. He thought we were a bed and breakfast. (CHUCKLES) We always talk about how this place is too big for the two of us. Well, I really should be going if I'm going to find another... Nonsense. No, no. No, it's late. Stay the night. MAN: No, I couldn't, no. Please. We'd enjoy the company, right? Yes, of course. - Are you sure? - Positive. Well, then I'll just grab the rest of my stuff. That's incredibly kind and generous. I just left it on the... (COUGHING) - You all right? - I'm fine. - (CONTINUES COUGHING) - HIM: You sure? MAN: Yeah. It just went down the wrong tube. Thanks. We don't know him. He's a doctor. He's a stranger. We're just gonna let him sleep in our house? You want me to ask him to leave? - Is that all? - That's everything. Um, we don't smoke. That's smart. In the house, I mean. Sorry. I'll go get you some linens. - I'll show you to your room. - MAN: Thank you. HIM: Once again, sorry for the mess. MAN: No, please. I really appreciate this.

Oh, my. - That's you? - Mmm-hmm. - I'm a huge fan. - You've read it? MAN: I've read it many, many times. Your words have changed my life. Oh, I'm sorry. You must... You must hear that all the time. Not really, no. MAN: And that. What is that? HIM: Careful. This is very, very delicate. It was a gift. MAN: A very special gift. Is it from you? No. When I was younger, I lost everything in a fire. MAN: Oh, I'm sorry. It's hard to imagine what that means. Losing everything. Your memories, your work, even your dirty toothbrush. I didn't know if I could ever create again until I found this in the ashes. Isn't that remarkable? MAN: Can I just... It gave me the strength to start again. And then I met her. You. And she breathed life back into every room. She redid all of it. Every last detail. - By yourself? - Mmm-hmm. Wow. So you're not just a pretty face. (COUGHING) I just came up to say I'm gonna get ready for bed. (CONTINUES COUGHING) I'm sorry. I didn't... You okay? Want some water? Are you all right? I'll be up soon. Sure you don't want some water? Just a little bit. Here you go. Sit down. (MAN RETCHING) HIM: You just drank too much. (RETCHING AND COUGHING) You're okay. It's okay. Is everything all right? He drank too much. He'll be fine. - What is... - Give him some privacy. Okay, get it up. Just get it all up.

What happened last night? I couldn't sleep. I got so excited. From what? His stories. I love the man's mind. It is so inspiring, speaking to someone who really appreciates the work. I love your work. Of course you do. I know that. So is he better? HIM: Pardon? MOTHER: Is he feeling better? (URINATING) - Is he all right? - Fine, fine. One sec. (GASPS) Oh, sorry. Just need a light.

(DOORBELL RINGS) - Who's that? - I'll get it. No, don't. I'll get it. MAN: Expecting guests? - HIM: We don't really get visitors. - MAN: That would drive me crazy. HIM: Tell me about it. - Hello. - Hello. - Can I help you? - Ah, you made it! My better half. - WOMAN: Get rid of that thing, won't you? - MAN: I'm not inhaling.

It's very nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet... You. - (ALARM STOPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LAUGHTER) WOMAN: Oh, please! MAN: I'd given up on romance. I was getting used to being alone. Oh, thank you. - But then... - WOMAN: Yummy. ...it just happened for us. I saw her, and I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. - Hmm. Love at first sight. - WOMAN: Same here. MAN: Yeah, right. What? How could I resist this face? You believe me, right? HIM: Come. Sit already. - So you never had a doubt? - WOMAN: That's true. - MAN: Oh, yeah. Come on. - What? - Didn't you have any doubts? - No! Not a one. You guys understand that kind of connection, right? You must. I mean, you're both so different. It must have been what pulled you together. You're so beautiful. Come here. (BOTH MOANING) And then the kids came and screwed it all up. - You have kids? - MAN: Two. - Boys. - HIM: Beautiful. Here. This is my eldest. HIM: Let me see. - MAN: And then her baby. - WOMAN: Oh, shut up. - Oh, amazing eyes. - MOTHER: Mmm. And you two? You have kids? Not yet. But we want them. WOMAN: Well, what are you waiting for?

Oh, so you're writing again? - Yeah. - WOMAN: Oh. - MAN: That's wonderful. - WOMAN: Finally, right? Yes. Oh, no. We're in the way. That's the last thing in the world... HIM: No, no, not at all. No, no. You're more than welcome to stay here as long as you want. That's very kind of you. WOMAN: No, we couldn't impose. Honey, they've got plenty of room. Speaking of kids, do you have a phone? I can't get a signal. That's how we like it. MAN: You don't have to call him every day. There's one in the kitchen. I can show you. No, it's all right. (SIGHS) Can we just relax for the weekend? WOMAN: No, honey, I just want to let him know we're okay. Just a quick call. What's wrong? Why would you do that without asking me? - Do what? - Invite them to stay. I didn't think it was a big deal. - It's strange. - What? Did you know he had a wife? What about your writing? I was actually enjoying not thinking about it. But now that I am thinking about it, I should go and do something about it. Hey. Hey. I really should work. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) WOMAN: Lemonade! Oops. Oh! Careful. Thought you might like some. Yes, thank you. Secret family recipe. Which part? The lemons? - How's your hand? - Mmm. - Still stinging. - I'm sorry. It's not like it was your fault. You don't have any painkillers, do you? Are you telling me the truth? I really don't have any. I'm sorry. Okay. You're not thirsty? Right. (GROANS SOFTLY) Now I get it. - It's strong. - I'm on my second. I can't believe you did all this work yourself. - Why not? - It's a lot. Well, we spend all our time here. I want to make it paradise. And I love the work. And it's exquisite. Thank you. Would you take me on a tour? Sure. I want to thank you for your hospitality. Your husband has been so generous. You're welcome. Well, where to begin? Well, this was the hardest part. There was so much damage. The treads were gone, the railing, even the skylight. So I had to get a lot of new material, but I tried to save as much... Isn't it a lot harder than just starting fresh? How do you mean? Why didn't you just build a new house? Well, it's... It's his home. Oh... You really love him. Can I ask you a question? Why don't you want kids? Excuse me? (CHUCKLES) I saw how you reacted earlier. I know what it's like when you're just starting out, and you think you have all the time in the world. You know, you're not going to be so young forever. Have kids. Then you'll be creating something together. That's what keeps a marriage going. This... This is all just setting. Oh, you do want them. Is it him? - I'm gonna get back to work. - Then why did he say... I'm sorry. Was I too forward? I do that sometimes. Every relationship has its issues. And when there's a full generation between you, I can only imagine. (GASPS) Is that where he works? That's private. Oh, can't you just give me a peek? He doesn't like anyone being in there without him! Wow. You really do love him. God help you. (LAUGHING) MOTHER: Where are you going? - I'm gonna take him outside. - We're going on a hike. A hike? - Me on a hike! - Just a quick one. Go slow. Yeah, slow enough so my smoke doesn't burn too quickly. - You don't want to come? - No, we have laundry to do. (MEN LAUGHING) You'll show me where, right? - MAN: Which way? - HIM: Doesn't matter. - The boys have bonded, don't you think? - Mmm-hmm. Mine's not usually such a nature boy. Wow. Guess you haven't quite got to this part yet. (SIGHS) This is so heavy. That's a lot of tools. I'll get it. - Which is which? - On the left. WOMAN: Oh, it's full. Oh, wait! I'll help you. Oh, no. So that's the problem. What? (SOFTLY) You're gonna have to try harder than this. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. (SIGHS) Believe me, when they get older, you got to keep it interesting. He's not that old. How's it going in that department? I don't feel comfortable talking about that stuff. I'm just trying to help. I mean, look at you. If he's not all over you, it's either because of his age or... Or what? You know what? Forget it. It's none of my business. I think this has gone to my head. No, it's okay. Say what you were gonna say. No, seriously. No, obviously he still loves you. I'm gonna freshen these up. (MACHINE WHIRRING) (FAUCET RUNNING) (SCOFFS) (FAUCET DRIPPING) Hello? (TOILET FLUSHES) (PLUNGER CLATTERS) (GRUNTS) Hey! I told you, he doesn't like anyone being in here without him. It's amazing. What is it? We really have to leave. - Please? - I just want to look at it. You have to go. I don't know why you have to make such a big deal of it. Oh, they're back. (MAN COUGHING) - HIM: This way. Here. - WOMAN: Honey? - Let's get you some water. - WOMAN: Are you all right (MAN CONTINUES COUGHING) Your damn smoking. Here. - WOMAN: You all right? - Just started. Come on. Let's go get you your pills. If I wanted a third child... I guess you overdid it. Whew! That was intense. And you won't believe what he just told me. That sink's not braced yet. What? Hey, wait. Something happened? What? What is it? What? He has one of those pictures of you in his luggage. What were you doing in their luggage? That's not the point. He didn't just stumble on us. - He's a crazy fan. - I know. Excuse me? That's what he told me on our walk. He's dying. (SIGHS) Oh. That's why he came here. He wanted to meet me before he's gone. Well, why didn't he tell us that? - Why lie? - I don't know. I don't know. He's a proud man. I admire that. (LOUD CRASH) WOMAN: Oh! - HIM: What have you done? - MAN: I'm so sorry. We're both sorry. I was telling her this story and... It just... It just fell out of my hand. - We'll search and find you another one. - WOMAN: We can pay for it. HIM: Quiet! (GASPS) I'm sorry I screamed. I just need a moment. It was an accident. I think it's best if you leave. We said we were sorry. - Honey, don't antagonize her. - Well, what more do you want? Just... It'll be okay. (SIGHS) (GASPS) Please. - Please! - (GASPS) (WOMAN MOANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SIGHS) (GASPS) (CLATTERS) (MACHINE WHIRRING) (BUZZES AND STOPS) (HAMMERING) What are you doing? They will never get in here again. (CONTINUES HAMMERING) Well, don't worry. I'm kicking them out. Yeah. And where will they go? Need something? - Are you ready? - What do you mean? (MAN COUGHING) We want you out. We? Or you? - I've tried very hard... - Yeah, well, look, I have to check on my husband. (DOOR OPENS) YOUNGER BROTHER: Hello? Hello! Where is everybody? Oh, hey. Hey, who are you? Who are you? What are you doing here? What are any of us doing here, right? Where's my mother? Uh, she's... Wait here. Hey, nice view. (DOOR OPENS) - Did you invite your son? - What are you doing here? Mom, I tried calling, but I couldn't get through. WOMAN: What's wrong? He came to the house and found the will. - What? - Yeah, he's out of control. I'm sorry, but whatever this is, - you'll have to finish this... - OLDEST SON: Dad! - He's here? - What? Oh, no. - Who's that? - OLDEST SON: Dad! Dad! Yeah, ran straight to Mommy. You followed me. What's wrong with you? - WOMAN: You shouldn't be here. - Where's Dad? Where is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who are you? - He doesn't want to see you. - That's not true. Is he here? - Dad! - MAN: Boys? Boys, why are you here? What is this? Do you know what you've signed? - Of course I do! - WOMAN: Go lie back down. You said that you told him. No, honey, I didn't say that. I was going to. You wanted this? How could you? MAN: It's for a good reason, son. Let me explain to him. - I'll talk to him. - No, I'll talk to him. You're right. I should have told you myself. And I'm sorry. I promise you that I was thinking about you. Stop it! About what's best for all of us. Just listen to Dad! It's a trust. You have to make a decision as a group before anything can be spent. It won't work. I have to get permission from them every time I take a piss? It will force you to get along. That's the most important thing. She will side with him every time. You're not even listening to me! WOMAN: No, no! I just want to support both of you. OLDEST SON: Support me? You just want to tell me what I can and can't do. WOMAN: That is not fair! OLDEST SON: You never believe in me or anything I try to do. Don't do this, Dad. They hate me! - MAN: They don't hate you. - WOMAN: We love you. You're my son. OLDEST SON: Well, then treat me like one! The sons are here. They just barged in. I couldn't stop them. I know. YOUNGER BROTHER: Yeah, if you don't waste it all. - OLDEST SON: Shut up! - YOUNGER BROTHER: Here we go again. Losing his temper when he doesn't get his way. Let's discuss this outside. Our hosts are here. No! I want to talk about it now. - I want to talk about it now, Dad. - YOUNGER BROTHER: Shut up! If you need money, I'll give you money. I don't want your chump change! - Don't touch me! - (SHRIEKS) Calm down. Calm down. (PANTING) You're the poet? The great writer? You don't know anything. They lied to me, they're robbing me. I don't know their story, but will you calm down? Will you? Thank you. You can sit in there. Let's go sit down and discuss this. No! Mom, Dad's dying, and all he cares about is his damn money! - No! Stop it! - Boys! Boys, stop it! (GROANS) Look at Dad! Look what you did! (SHRIEKS) (GRUNTING) Stop! WOMAN: Boys! Stop it! Stop! Please! HIM: Can you breathe? Breathe. (SPITS) No! (SCREAMS) - Come here! - MOTHER: Wait! Stop! - YOUNGER BROTHER: What's wrong with you? - Stop it! No! Stop! No! - (GRUNTS) - (SHRIEKS) No! No! OLDEST SON: Get off! Get up. Get up! Get up! Stop faking. Get up. Get up. Look at me! (PANTING) No, look. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. They never really loved me. They always loved him more. They were leaving me behind. Just tell me you understand. Tell me you understand! (SOBBING) You have to understand. HIM: What have you done to your brother? WOMAN: My baby. My baby. What did you do? (SOBBING) What did you do? You did this. Wake up! Do something! Help him! - Towels. Towels. - Okay. (DOOR OPENS) - HIM: Easy now. - Father... - The doctor. Go get him. - Okay. - Come quick! - What? - What's happening? - He's bleeding. - It's bad! It's really bad. - He's not waking up. He's not waking up. WOMAN: Careful. Careful! Don't drop him. I'll call you from the hospital. - MAN: Keep his head up. - No! No, please stay with me. Please, we need him. Lock the doors. I'll be back as soon as I can. Please don't leave me! Please don't leave me! (PANTING) (BUZZING) (RUMBLING) (PULSATING) (GASPS SOFTLY) (WATER TRICKLING) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) (CROAKS) (GASPS) (GLASS BREAKS) (GLASS CRUNCHES) - Hey. - (GASPS) They left you all alone? You do understand. (GASPING) (GROANS) Good luck. (DOOR CLOSES) (LINE RINGING) ORACLE: 911. What's your emergency? - What's your emergency? - (GASPS) You all right? (SOBS) He was here! I know. I know. The police brought me home. They'll find him. Don't worry. - Did he hurt you? - No. - No? - No. Okay. Okay, sit. Let me get you some water. Here. It's okay. It's all right. What happened at the hospital? I was holding the boy's hand when he died. Oh, that's awful. Are you all right? I'm exhausted. I need a hot shower. Will you come? Yeah. What is it? - I'll be up in a minute. - You sure? Yeah. (SNORING) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR OPENS) In here? WOMAN: Yeah, straight ahead in the kitchen. They came back quick. What are they doing here? They had nowhere to go, so I told them it would be all right to invite some friends and family. I'll go deal with them. - HIM: I'm so sorry. - WOMAN: Thank you. HIM: I'm so sorry for your loss. HIM: You're all so welcome here. Please make yourselves at home. I'm so sorry. Shall we have a toast? MOURNER: Yes, let's. MOURNER 2: Make sure everyone has one. (WHISPERS) Would you say something? He so respects you. - HIM: Of course. - Thank you. Everyone. Well, how can one begin to understand your pain? The sacrifice of the parent. CUPBEARER: Here you go. HIM: All those years of worry. Years in days, days in hours, hours in seconds. But in each second, an infinite amount of love. And now, suddenly, it seems there is nothing to love. Just a vast and silent darkness. (WOMAN SOBBING) HIM: But fear not. From inside it, there's a voice crying out to be heard... (WOMAN SOBBING) ...loud and strong. Just listen. Oh, God. (ALL SOBBING) Do you hear that? Do you hear that? That is the sound of life. That is the sound of humanity. That is your son's voice. His cry of love. His love for you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. CUPBEARER: Hear, hear! ALL: Hear, hear! (GLASSES CLINK) WOMAN: Thank you all for coming here and being with us tonight. My husband and I are so touched. We lost our baby today. (DOORBELL RINGS) WOMAN: I just... I can't believe that just a few hours ago, he was standing there, and I was holding him in my arms. He was so full of life. He always was. - Hello. - Thank you. - Where should I put this? - FRIEND: Maybe in here. (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN: Now he'll never wander again. I'll never hold him again like I did today. He'll never laugh again. I just want to thank you all for being here. It means so much. I don't know what else to say. I just want to thank our dear host for his hospitality - in our time of need. - Of course. So, please, I'd like to drink to your kindness. CONSOLER: Excuse me. WOMAN: Sweetheart, you don't have to do this. No, I want to. I loved my son. I loved him. (SOBS) I can't believe this. But I shouldn't be eulogizing him. He'd say... (SIGHS) (SOBBING) I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I can't. Would someone please... Would you say something? I... For your child. For both your children. Come. Let's not forget the one still in the wilderness. (DOOR OPENS) Wherever he goes, wherever he is... Welcome. Please join us. I'm just gonna put this in the kitchen. HIM: Yes, through there. May he find kindness, compassion... - CONSOLER: I'll wait here. - I'll be right back. - FOOL: Hey, how you doing? - CONSOLER: I'm good, considering. Um, excuse me. Could you get down from there? That sink's not braced yet. Oh, I'm sorry. (GLASS CRUNCHING) Oh, there's glass there. That was so beautiful, no? It's all right. Can I use your phone? Sure. It's in the kitchen. No, it's just... Excuse me? Where did you go? I was just in the... I'm really sorry, again. I know you are. - I can't imagine... - No. You can't imagine what it feels like if you don't have a child. You give, and you give, and you give, and... It's just never enough. - I understand. - Do you? Why don't you at least put on something decent? (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (CUPBEARER LAUGHS) Hey! You can't be in here. - I'm sorry? - You need to leave. - We'll just be a minute. - This is our room! (CHUCKLES) CUPBEARER: It's okay. It's your room. Come on. Let's find another spot. (GROANS) (GASPING) Oh. Excuse me. Just exploring. (PANTING) (SIGHS) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Excuse me. Could you please go downstairs? - This way? - Yes. IDLER: Sure. What is... What are you doing? Oh, it's no big deal. I worked my way through college doing this. But why are you painting my house? Well, he's been so kind to everyone, it's the least we could do. Stop! Both of you. Stop! No problem. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) HIM: Yes, of course. What's mine is yours. There you are! My goddess. Come here. Please, make some room for her. You've got to hear these stories. All these people! I know. They're just letting off steam. They're painting our house! HIM: Oh! - HIM: You all right? - (LAUGHING) MOURNER: I told you to stop drinking. I got it. - MOURNER 2: Napkins! - MOURNER 1: Yeah, I got some. - MOURNER 2: Are you all right? - HIM: The chair might not be all right. FOOL: After spending a few days with my mother... Please! Get down from there. Sorry. Excuse me. (SIGHS) - FOOL: What's her problem? - I don't know. Hey, we haven't met. I've known this family for years. And you? This is my house. (CHUCKLES) Well, it's a beautiful home. You want to take a walk? - What? - A walk. With me. No. No. Please! - Take my number. - No, I don't want your number. Why would you say that? You don't even know me. - Let go of me! - Why? Because I don't know you. - Get down from there. - From where? You don't know what I could do for you. I don't want anything from you. Sassy. Leave me alone. You know what? Get out of my face. You're an arrogant cunt. This sink. There's nothing wrong with it. It's really okay. No, stop doing that. Don't do that. Stop! Stop doing that! Stop, stop! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Get out! Get out, all of you! What happened? They won't listen! It's all right. We'll fix it. It can be fixed. - WOMAN: We're being punished. - Please, don't go. Don't go. - We'll turn it off. - It's been an honor. We will never forget all you've done for us. HIM: But where will you go? - (DOOR CLOSES) - (CHATTERING STOPS) (WATER TRICKLING) (CUTLERY CLATTERING) They're gone. Come. Let's go to bed. You don't need to do that. Do what? Clean up their mess? We did a good thing. They needed a place to celebrate life. They needed tonight. What about what I needed? A boy died here today. I mopped up his blood. - And you abandoned me. - No, no, I didn't abandon you. They just lost a son. They lost, well, two sons! I was helping them. This is not about us. It's about them. No! It's not about them. It's about you. It's always about you and your work. You think that's gonna help you write? Nothing does! I rebuilt this entire house, wall to wall. You haven't written a word! I know! I know! I'm sorry! I can't... I can't write! I can't think! All I'm trying to do is bring life into this house! Open the door to new people, new ideas. You think you can't breathe? I'm the one who's suffocating here while you pretend that nothing is wrong! "Everything will be all right. Everything will be good. "You'll be fine." You know what? Life doesn't always work out the way you want it to. You're right. Mine certainly didn't. Excuse me? You talk about wanting kids, but you can't even fuck me. - Come here. Come here! - No! No!

Look at me! I'm about to have our baby. Why is that not enough for you? Of course it's enough. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here, with you. I want to be alone with you. I'm with you. Give me a second.
