PALIMPSEST Palimpsest, n. A parchment or the like from which writing has been partially or completely erased to make room for another text. Yes? Who? What time is it? In an hour. Base of the skull cracked, spinal cord broken... A fall from a big height. Except for the water in his lungs, nothing below the norm. The autopsy showed that Inspector Hajdziak could've been manhandled. End of quote. You can use any help you can get. - I get it. - Marmielewski will join you. - I'd rather... - Forget it. I know you and Maciek were friends. But don't take it too personal. You know what I mean? If something pops up... let me know first. Is there something I should know, Marek? No. How long and who did he drink with? Who? How long, how long? His whole life as far as I know. A three-week bender, that. Who with? Everybody. His latest comrade in drink? Malina. Must've quaffed for a couple of days. Malina's whereabouts? Malina's whereabouts? Cuckoo's nest! Where else? How long? Since yesterday... could be. Or since today. Dates get me fucking confused. Ever been on the wagon? Oh, it's you Inspector! - To check in? - No, to visit Malina. Sorry. - Doctor? - Yes? They are the police. Want to see Malina. Mr. Malina was brought in last night. You sure must know that if you visit him now, he's likely to think you must be aliens, sent down to take him away. So you may freak him out. Doctor, you must surely know we've known him for years. Second, it transpires that he's implicated in the murder of a policeman. So if he gets out of hand he may freak you out. Don't make it difficult for us, please. When was he brought in? - At 2:20 a. M. - Where from? The hospital in Minsk. He was unmanageable. - How long did he stay there? - From yesterday morning. Where's he now? - Take them to him. - Still under observation. - He gave us a hard time. - Marcin... Haven't you seen my 12 bottles of champagne? Hi, Malina. You've drunk with Maciek recently. Someone pushed him out the window. Malina, Maciek's dead. Someone killed him. Maciek... Out the window... First... Mrowa... Maciek... - A guy... - Who? Wielded a doorknob... - Bury... - Bury? Maciek... Bury. When was that? Friday... Last week... Tuesday. Thanks. Let's go. Marek! What? A fucking spider's crawling down your neck. Take care. Maciek... Maciek. The champagne's drunk off! - That Bury rings a bell? - No. Check on him. An old score? Let's go. The police! Down! The police! Freeze! The police! Down! Move it! Hands behind you! I secure him... Doctor! - What was it? - Coke. - It stopped 1. 5 min. Ago. - Plug in the monitor. Fibrillation. Gel. Defibrillate. 200 joules! Here I go! 200 once again. Good. Beating. Bury, you killed a cop. Did you! Didn't you! You did!!! He's just come to. - Have you found something? - Not yet. - Bury hasn't done it. - You paid him a visit? I questioned his wife. They stayed in Mazury till last night: A village wedding of 800 guests. - An alibi? - Could be. So much drugs and weapons found in the house that he may do a long spell, but not for homicide. - How is he? - Could talk in a day or two. Those bruises, burns on his palm? Funny... He couldn't have done it himself. The witnesses are waiting. And Hanna? Yes, she's been summoned. A few questions. That night before the incident, did anything draw your attention? Some strangers... hanging around? Did you see him that day? Why? I found him. I'd seldom seen him recently... only at night. He'd go to the store... once in several days. I don't know much. Ask the man across the street. Who? At No 6, the 2nd staircase. Who's he? I don't know anything. He's just a neighbor. - A neighbor... - Yeah. Well, we won't grill you any longer. We're stuck? Let's check on the neighbor. I want to talk to her alone. I get it. Hi, Marek. What's up? You don't look good. Tired? I don't sleep well. You don't... But I sleep perfectly. What did you do Thursday night? I still can't get used to it. I'd like to question you... as a witness, of course. When was the last time you saw Maciek? Since we parted? Long ago. Could someone... want him dead? He wasn't around any more. Fear... - Constant fear. - How are things with you? Thanks for asking. Everything's fine with us. A new hairdo. Why are you doing it to me, Marek? Anything else you'd like to ask? I'm leaving. What? Hello, this is the police. May we? - Sure if necessary. - It is. Then you may. You know why we're here? I've seen you. You deliver sugar? The night before last, a man fell out the 3rd story window. We have reason to suspect we was defenestrated. - Anything caught your attention? - No. I don't recall anything unusual... ... beside your friend falling out the window. - A friend? How d'you know? - A policeman. You are the police, right? So he must've been a friend. I looked out when it got noisy. I was watching something on TV... Now... come to think of it... that thud... a funny dull sound, that. A strange sound. Well? Have you found anything interesting? - You know now? - What? Where you saw me. - Well, we'll be going now. - Yes. - Mister... - Zygmunt. If you can possibly... I may recall something. Where is it? Where is it?! Pour! Quaff, you fuck! Search! Freeze! Hands on your nape! Down! Good evening. Where's the doctor on duty? Where's the doctor on duty?! Tomek! Come here. We'll have a drink. You don't feel well, Tomek? Everything's fine with me. Marek's in the corridor. - Bring him in. - Wait. I want you to do something for me... for him. How can I help him? Detox him first. - Piece of cake, right? - I've done it a couple of times. What else? Keep him here as long as possible. What happened? This will be best for him. Well, shall we down one? Going anywhere? I asked for a discharge. I'm fine. I see. We got to question that thug as fast as possible. We won't. He hanged himself in his cell. - Bury? - Bury what? - Where is he? - He's safe. - He's the next one. - Cool it. We're watching him. You were the other one too. You visited Hajdziak 5 days ago. - You were aggressive. - I'm hyperactive. - He was murdered the next day. - I didn't kill him. - Why that visit? - A social call. Who sent you? Drugs - 5 years, accomplice - 15. Man... I sometimes moonlight as a debt collector. A guy called, said he knew some men in town. We met at the Bristol Hotel with his henchman. He gave me the address and told me to scare Hajdziuk. - Hajdziak. - Scare or what? Just scare, as he'd forgotten to pay off something. Pay off what? Your Hajdziuk was in such condition that you could scare him with an overdue phone bill. How do you know it wasn't the henchmen who called? The voice was different. Would you recognize him? What if? It's about a homicide of a cop. You don't set conditions. Let's have composite portraits of those two, and check connections. Someone may know them. I know one who does them all, unless they were foreign. - We must get back to Bury. - We have time. Where did you get the keys? From you. But you sent them back. I'd made copies earlier. Just in case... Just in case? Shall I call a taxi? You want to go? To have breakfast sent here. Yes? Dead? Where from? Yes. I must. Just this once. Too late. OD'd for good. Why did you do it? What? - I didn't kill. - Gimme the portraits! Them? Them?! You... I what? I what? I what, Bury? Man, not here! This is Zubiec. I don't know the other's alias. They're both hatchet men. Whose? Whose? That's him. Him for sure. You lie! Go now. Him. Why a Maciek's photo? We check everything. - A dead man put a contract on me? - Could be an old score? No score whatsoever! You may not have been friends you thought you were. I give up the case. It'll be better for the inquiry if someone else takes it up. I haven't included this in the files. What's that? This all is getting too personal. I get confused. - You're not alone on this. - I don't trust him. I don't know his game. Your resignation's rejected. That's still your case. You remember now? Is that what you want? What's that? You. When did you snap it? You'll see. See what? What you don't want. - Where did you get it? - From you. You remember nothing? The photo is a montage. The program you see on TV was aired last night. You contrive evidence! Why? Someone's trying to set me up. Maybe it's you? You're off the case as you requested. Leave it. Why have you come? Beat it! What did I do? I can't go on like this. Please, I love you. You killed him! No. I loved him! Please... What d'you want me to do? I want you to disappear. Malina... - He won't be troublesome. - I wouldn't take chances. Take him. - Quiet... quiet... come... - You crazy?! Don't worry. We'll take care of him. Not true. All this is untrue... Someone's trying to set me up. I've seen you. - Hello, Mrs. Hanna. - Hello. Your husband's been hanging around here. - Hello! - I'd like to talk to you later. Good. Hi. How you doing? All right. Attention please. Our main topic - Patient Jeklewski. Things don't seem to be looking up. Dr. Nowicki, please. He was brought in 2 months ago, a extreme case of intoxication. He was roused from coma quite fast, but now it's Wernicki-Korsakov psychosis with recurring d. T: Tremor and hallucinations for the last 6 weeks. With this psychosis one totally confabulates reality and despite strong tranquilizers has psychotic fears. Our therapeutic results are nil. He remains without the least contact with the outside world. He has contact with another one, though. Only his wife can unite the two worlds on the emotional level. I believe she holds the key to his recovery. A daring thesis, that. His wife's been coming here every day for two months. He hasn't spoken to her or to anybody for that matter. We doubt if he still has the skill to communicate this way. So I wonder where you get your conclusions. From my observation, Dr. Nowicki. We have the diagnosis. What further therapy do you recommend? It's a given that this psychosis is connected with irreparable damage to the brain and central nervous system. Despite our efforts, his condition hasn't improved in the least. We have to admit it that he is a typical lost case, and our role has come to a close. With all due respect, I disagree: This is not a typical lost case. The man is somewhere and quite possibly we're there with him. Our task is to find him at any price and... A wild-goose chase, doctor, no matter how beautifully you put it. Honorable colleagues, all we can talk about is what to do with him now. So it's home or social care? I don't think the wife would agree. It's easiest to get rid of a problem, but we're here to help, aren't we, Dr. Nowicki? How you doing? Everything's fine with me, thank you. You're looking well, darling. Would you like to ask about something? God, are you still there, Mark?! Am I too? I wonder why I... - Mrs. Hanna. - Yes? I'll be waiting in my office. Hanna... Yes?! You here. I am.
