[PANTING HEAVILY] [HYDROCOPTER APPROACHING] Hello, Morning Rose. This is Larsen. Morning Rose, are you receiving me? Over. This is Larsen at Bear Island Base. Larsen calling Morning Rose. Over. [RADIO STATIC] Come in, Morning Rose. Over. Larsen calling Morning Rose. Do you read me? Larsen calling Morning Rose! Professor Gerran, we just picked up a radio signal, distorted and breaking up. It's on the NATO frequency allocated to your expedition -for emergency use... -What was the message? All I got was "Morning Rose. Bear |s|and". Then it stopped. [SIGHS] I wish people would obey instructions. Danke. Dankeschiin. Otto, the orders are perfectly clear. Yes, but they are breaking the orders. Professor, you must contact the Island party immediately. The Advance team must have a difficulty. You know the conditions made by NATO for allowing us on Bear Island. For the present, we must not use the radio. And what if the position is something serious? Then they will call us again. Will they not? Chopper's here. -How's your head now? -320, sir. Hold her steady at that. OKZY- Don't winch it. I'll abseil. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. -Thanks for the ride. -Okay, Dr Lansing. I don't believe it. That guy's going to abseil. He would. Hard to port! Man overboard! [ALARM BLARING] He'll freeze to death in those waters. SMITHY: Take me to him! Out of the way, Dr Rubin. Midships! Okay. All right. Stop. Got it! You okay? I will be after a quart of rum and a good cry. Let me hook this on you. Hold it. OKZY- Hold tight now. Here we go. Do you always make such dramatic entrances, Dr Lansing? To arrive late and with such a clamour for attention would indicate deep insecurity and fear of rejection. Do you know? I'm late because I was on vacation when this expedition upped its timetable. And I'm not here to listen to the questionable views of a nomadic Norwegian shrink, Dr Lindquist. Thank you. I'm getting out of here right now. He's all yours, Doc. And, thanks. That's all right. Any time. Hey, Smithy. Thank you for your help out there. I'll see you both in the afternoon at 6:30, huh? I'm sorry. I guess that was rude. A nomadic Norwegian shrink? I think it's a fairly accurate description. Would you drink this, please? I'm fine. If you don't mind, Doctor. I'm the doctor here. Drink it, please. [MUMBLING] Yes, sir. [DOOR CREAKING] GERRAN: It won't be a picnic. The island is small and remote. Uninhabited apart from the NATO base. You all know why the United Nations is sending out these expeditions. The world's climate is changing, rapidly. So, if we can predict how far temperatures and rainfall will change, there may still be time to stave off widespread famine. Now I have studied your individual research programmes and I feel that the... Thaddeus Lechinski. -Frank Lansing. How are you? -As I was saying. Your research programmes are comprehensive. But some of them may have to be trimmed. Nothing must delay our final report. This panic is ridiculous. The cycle of change will take decades. Not if those Russians divert those rivers. Come again? -Frank, there's been some important... -If I may. Dr Lansing, various... Now, please. Please, please, please. Just before we embarked, Dr Lansing, a report was handed me that the Russians are planning to divert several large rivers southwards, instead of emptying into the Arctic as they do now. -Why? -Because it is... So they can reclaim millions of acres of fertile land. And change the whole of the world's weather in the process. -Fantasy. -Fantasy? -Do you realise... -GERRAN: But it will have some effect. The Arctic must get warmer without all that fresh water pouring in. It's... And the icecap must gradually melt, changing the ocean currents. Therefore the winds and therefore the rainfall of the world. He's right. It'll be too late to change their minds. They have got to be stopped now. You're prejudging results. Some results have got to be prejudged. This is political intolerance! Why do you always bring politics into it? -GERRAN: Quite! Please! -I have told you before. -This is not the first time. -Quiet! Quiet. Please, please. I will not permit this bickering. We have to spend many months together on this island. Life will be difficult enough without adding political quarrels. It's nice to be working with you again, Frank. You haven't changed, have you? [LAUGHING] I'm surprised you didn't go on one of those tropical expeditions. Oh, no. What made you choose Bear Island? I've never been there. Hmm. It's unbelievable. The great Bear Glacier. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. I said it makes you want to reach out and touch the cliffs. They seem so close. [WIND HOWLING] [SHIP BELL DINGING] The home of the grey sharks. Sharks? U-boats. This is one of Germany's biggest bases. The Bear Island pack. What a place to die. Those poor devils. Save your sympathy. Those U-boats sent thousands of Allied seamen to their deaths. [SHIP HORN SOUNDING] CAPTAIN: Number one hold first, Mr Johnson. Aye, Aye, sir. [HYDROCOPTERS APPROACHING] -Otto. -Yeah? What is it? I checked once again. Lansing doesn't speak German. Gut. Sehr gut. -Guten Abend. -Guten Tag. I'm afraid we have bad news for you, Herr Doktor. So, what is it? -Larsen has disappeared. -Disappeared? That's right. We searched the island but we don't know what has happened to him. But he was an expert in these conditions. He was with the Norwegian Army Ski Patrol. This island is treacherous. There are crumbling cliffs, avalanches... What if he's lying injured somewhere? Judith, Jungbeck and Heyter have spent days searching for him. Professor, you must ask NATO base to send a helicopter to search for him. Doctor, in your opinion if Larsen was lying injured for five or six days... In these temperatures, he would be dead. [HORN SOUNDING] Hey, what happened to your bag? Somebody ransacked my cabin. -What? -No point making a fuss. -Nothing was taken. -Did you report it? Yeah, I told Gerran. I'll be damned. SMITHY: It's kind of funny about that guy Larsen, huh? LANSING: Yeah. Wasn't it? Well, there it is. SMITHY: Home sweet home for the next six months. That's all that's left of the camp. Rest of the buildings were all locked down after the war. Well... What's the matter? I can almost hear what it must've been like, in the war. They have made it very comfortable, Otto. I had expected something more primitive. May I have your attention, please? Herr Jungbeck considers parts of this island exceedingly dangerous. I have marked them in red on that map. I want everyone to keep away from them until I have examined them myself. We do not want a repeat of what happened to Larsen. What is this? SMITHY: That's the no-go line. You stray this side of it, you get shot. NATO's early warning station's in there. What are these? The old U-boat pens. You got any tape? Tape? No. Sorry. Anybody got anything I can fix that with? Can you help me fix that? Yeah. Surgical tape would hold it. I'll get it. -The door. Would you mind? -Not at all. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] "The Psychology of Stress by Dr Heddi Lindquist. "Man and Industry. Volume One." What's Volume Two about? I'm still working on it. Stress on these expeditions. Yes. Boy, I'd sure hate to go out with a psychiatrist. Probably have to think 15 times before you said anything. The first thought is usually the most honest. Do you want to hear mine? No. You stick to your marine biology. That suits me just fine. Did you know that the monkfish had a very active sexual life? Yes. You know that they lay a prodigious number of eggs. They lay them in along ribbon, 30 feet long. 30 feet long. Yes, that's right. MAN: The sonar's working fine. LANSING: Yeah, okay. Good. LANSING: She's got plenty of power. SMITHY: She'll need it later. Part of the harbour inlet froze over the last time I was here. -So, Smithy's been here before, Frank? -Yeah. Smithy! When were you here before? In '71. The Geophysical Year. Yeah. You want me to take a plankton sample? Yeah. Where'd you put the reversing thermometre? -In the wheelhouse. -|'|| get it. LANSING: What are you looking at? Just one of the old U-boat bases. Can I have a look? They bombed the hell out of them about six weeks before the war ended. The top entrance to the sub-pens caved in. The whole underground harbour's been sealed off ever since. I think what you're looking at now is a part of the cliff that came down during the air raids. Completely blocked off the underwater entrance. Kind of eerie, huh? [SOFTLY] They used to come in under there. -Spuds, peas, carrots? -Peas. I've been meaning to tell you, Professor, how much I've enjoyed your German Naval histories. Danke. But you flatter me by calling them histories. -Oh, no. -|t's just a sideline. A hobby, you might say. Excuse me. Lansing has read my naval books. Doesn't mean anything, Otto. I'm sure his name is just a coincidence. A lot of people have read them. But they have never been translated, Paul. And you said he spoke no German. [MEN LAUGHING] LANSING: You forgot to close the door. Push that down, will you? -Where's he gone this time of night? -Who? Lechinski. He was just out there. What the hell's a Russian doing in a NATO security area anyway? I thought he was Polish. Polish, Russian. What's the difference? "|n case of air attack, disconnect gas at main supply." It's like a time capsule, isn't it? That's exactly what it's like. We're still in the war years. Bear Island getting you down already, Frank? No, but I think it's getting you down. What does that mean? I thought I knew you, Judith, but you've been riding Lechinski ever since we got here. -I don't like him. -Why not? Because he's Polish or Russian? I don't trust Russians, all right? I know it's unfair. It sounds right-wing racist, but that's how I feel, Frank. Well, it's dumb. We've been friends a long time. Would it make any difference to you if I told you I was German? You? You're 100% Californian. I was born in Germany. My mother took me to the United States when I was seven years old. And your father? My daddy was a U-boat commander. A real live hero. Had the Iron Cross pinned on him personally by Adolph Hitler. He was here, on Bear Island. Wasn't he? That's why you joined this expedition. Well, "hero" was their word for it. I don't know. What the hell is a hero anyhow? Are you taking the boat? No, I'm going skiing. From where? Dr Rubin asked me to help her with her wind metres. Ah. We're here. And we want to get there. We're going to have to go round that way. It's much shorter that way. Yeah, but the Professor's marked that way out of bounds. That's not avalanche country. Come on, Judith. They know what they're doing. So do I. I was brought up in country like this. Don't forget my dad was a Snow Control Officer. They've marked the wrong place on the map. I know I'm right, Frank. We're going my way, okay? My way takes us near the old U-boat base. Don't you want to see it? Can I give you an Eskimo kiss? [GUNSHOT] [LOUD EXPLOSION] LANSING: Avalanche! Stay close behind me. Come on! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] Judith! Judith! Oh, no! [HYDROCOPTER APPROACHING] Judith. Judith! Lansing! -She... She's back... -Lansing, I saw what happened. [LANSING GROANING] Lansing, there's nothing you can do! Lansing! Lansing. You had no right to go there, Doctor. You disobeyed my instructions. Judith said it wasn't an avalanche area and she knew about snow. But you were hit by an avalanche, my friend. -Now take it easy. -There were shots. There was an explosion. It wasn't an accident. It was a man-made avalanche. Is it me here or is it terribly cold in here? Now you must radio the NATO base. First Larsen, now Judith. I do not wish to seem insensitive, but Dr Rubin is dead. What is the point of breaking radio silence? There's nothing NATO can do for two people who are beyond help. For God's sake. It was no accident, Smithy. Somebody fired a shot. It was an explosion. That's what started the avalanche. Do you really think somebody tried to kill you? Me or Judith. Or just anybody heading that way. Why? You have any idea? [HYDROCOPTER ENGINE REVVING] Frank. [THUDS] What the hell is going on, Doctor? What are you doing in here? This is Larsen's room. I can't tell you, Frank. OKZY- Get up. We'll go and see Gerran. No, don't! Don't! All right, Frank. I'll tell you. Shut the door. [LINDQUIST PANTING] Larsen worked for the Norwegian Intelligence. The government. The Norwegian government asked me to come here -and help him when I got here. -Help him? Why? -Are you his intelligence? -No. They wanted someone to assist him, another Norwegian. What was he doing here? -I don't know. -Come on, Doctor. What's going on? I think Larsen was murdered. When he disappeared, only Jungbeck and Heyter were here. And Jungbeck marked up those avalanche zones. With Gerran. Come on, Doctor. If you know anything, you've got to tell me. They said it was something to do with submarines. We were skiing towards the old German U-boat base when the avalanche hit us. Judith was murdered. [GENERATOR STARTING] It took time to put that rig in there, Smithy. Only Jungbeck and Heyter have been here long enough. -We||, what do you think is going on? -I don't know. I got no idea. That's up to the NATO base to sort out. That means using the radio. And if you're right about Judith and Larsen being murdered, these two guys are playing for big stakes and they are not alone. Lechinski's with them for one. Professor Gerran. He put those areas out of bounds. And if he's with them, you'll never get to that radio. I'll bust into that radio room. And then what? What frequency do you use? -Whose side are you on, Smithy? -The side that's staying alive. It's not making a move until we find out who all the players are -and what they're up to. -We||, I know who two of them are, and they murdered Judith and that's enough for me. Where are you going? -|'m gonna go find them, Smithy. -Calm down. I'm dead calm, Smithy. Dead calm. Frank, you're gonna blow it! Manfred. Manfred! Hey, Manfred! Looks like you could have a sparring partner. You any good? I'll spar with you. Get the gloves, Smithy. No gloves. Don't mind getting your face cut. He moves very well. Come on. Quit it. -Can't you stop it? -You kidding? I'd pay to see this. Time to go, pal. Time to go. I think you got enough out of your system for a while. Come on. Come on, boy. I'll get your boots. Sit down. We've got to get in touch with that NATO base somehow. There's no way to get through those mountains. We don't know that for sure. Okay. We can go take a look anyway, huh? I'll see if I can get us a hydrocopter for tomorrow. You're pretty silent. I don't like primitive behaviour. I thought psychiatrists were supposed to understand that kind of thing. Understanding's got nothing to do with it. It isn't broken? No. Why did you fight with him? Something else has happened, hasn't it? I guess it would be unethical if the patient kissed the doctor while receiving treatment, wouldn't it? I saw him and I thought of Judith and I saw red, I guess. Primitive behaviour. You haven't answered my question. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Dr Lansing. How did that fight happen? We were exercising. Your irresponsibility, Doctor, is a threat to the success of my programme. First, your foolish descent from that helicopter, then you caused the death of Dr Rubin by disobeying my orders. Now, you have brutally injured one of my staff. It simply got out of control. This is no place for scientists who cannot control themselves. If there is one more incident, Doctor, |wi|| have you replaced. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Lansing. Goodnight, Vienna. LANSING: What's the matter? SMITHY: It's my suspicious nature. Gonna see if anybody's following us. The personal files of all the team? Why do you need those? I have to have a proper medical index. We must have certain basic medical facts available immediately like the blood group, ja? Very efficient, but they must not leave this office. SMITHY: Here. LANSING: What is it? Somebody on skis. LANSING: It's just a coincidence. He can't be following us on skis. Who is it anyway? I don't know, but he's got a rifle. Here. Let's push on. Sooner we get to the NATO base, the better. You know something, Smithy, you behave just like a professional. What are you? [SMITHY LAUGHING] You begin to see Indians... Smithy! You okay? -Smithy? -Yeah, I'm okay. Drop the rifle, comrade. All my life I have been surrounded by men who thought they could solve problems with guns. Or explosions. Right, Thaddeus? You two had better start walking. It's too cold to stand around. We're all gonna walk. You first. It would be wiser if I skied back for help. You could follow my tracks. It would not be a problem. Tell me something, Lechinski, where the hell do you go at night when you leave the camp? Much of my life I have spent in detention camps of both sides. After an hour or two in that complex, I have to get out. We'll follow your tracks. You send somebody back to pick us up. [HYDROCOPTER APPROACHING] MAN: Here they come! Are you all all right? LANSING: I guess we'll live. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] What happened? The gas tankjust blew up. I mean, that was the only explanation that we could think of. You should both see Dr Lindquist. Just in case. Professor. What's gonna be done about all these accidents? Yes. There's something we are not being told about. I don't understand why you can't get someone here to investigate. My report is going out by helicopter next week. There's nothing I can do before that. Just because somebody's given an order not to use the radio? [SPEAKING IN NORWEGIAN] Nothing is going to change your mind? How many more have got to die, Professor? Dr Lindquist! You talk of orders. Well, the orders are quite specific and not to be disobeyed. [SHOUTING] Not! Do you hear me? Nein! [LANSING WHISTLING] Something's bugging you? Maybe. I knew it was gonna be one of those days. I nearly get my ass blown off, now my analyst is mad at me. If I ask you a straight question, will you give me a straight answer? -Sure. -Why have you come on this expedition? Because my father was based here during the war. He was a German U-boat commander. [LANSING LAUGHING] That's the first time I've ever been hugged because my father was a German. I found a message from Larsen. Jungbeck and Heyter are Nazis. What else did he say? Jungbeck and Heyter are Reichskinder. What are Reichskinder? That means they were born at a Nazi baby farm near Hamburg. At the beginning of the war SS men mated with pure Aryan girls trying to breed perfect Nazis. Reichskinder. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Go on. The other Nazi who controls them is code-named Zelda. Identity unknown, but is a member of the expedition. It has to be either Lechinksi or Gerran. Gerran. It has got to be Gerran. Look at the way he's kept everybody away from the radio. Even after Judith was killed, and Larsen, he didn't go to find him. That's what Smithy says. Okay, go on. They have located U-boat 351. What could be so important about my father's U-boat? LANSING: There it is. The wires go... My father's in there. Oh, Frank, I can't even... Oh, Frank, I'm so sorry. When I was a kid in the States I used to go to movies and I used to see the U-boat commanders machine-gunning women and children in life boats and I used to wonder if he... The lights go that way. Boxes of explosives. Careful. This is where they've been working. Frank, do you think all those murders were for some boxes of explosives? LINDQUIST: Gold. Can you imagine how much it must be worth today? But how does our friend Zelda plan to get the gold off the island? It doesn't matter. Because when everyone's asleep tonight we're going into that radio room. I'm gonna broadcast a mayday on every frequency they've got... Anybody who goes for that radio is dead. I'm telling you. These guys are not kidding. You've got a gun. Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. [WIND HOWLING] [RADIO STATIC] When I was researching my last book, I established what happened to every U-boat in our fleet except 351. And I have combed through every Allied combat report for the week it left Norway. No one even attacked the submarine. It must have got here with the Norwegian gold reserves. Jungbeck and Heyter are doing their best. So far they've found no trace of it. I know. But I have dreamed of this. To find that gold and return it to Norway. No one would dare whisper then that I was a Nazi. Otto, you were cleared in the Denazification trials. You're a distinguished man, respected Ioyally. Nobody needs proof. But perhaps I do, Paul. Many of us went along with them. To find the gold and give it back, an act of contrition. Good evening, Professor. You wanted to see us. I wanted to know if you have made any progress. Well, it's slow work searching the sea bed. You see, we can't use the echo sound now that this Smithy is running the research boat. Tell them about Smith, Otto. I brought with me research papers from my new book, including reports of the American demolition team. Some of them were signed by a George Smith. -It is a common name. -It is the same signature. He could still be serving. Perhaps with Intelligence. I must find that gold before anyone else does. If it exists, Otto. Hey, let's keep the snow outside, eh? [LINDQUIST SPEAKING NORWEGIAN] -Shut the door. -Hey! Where the hell has he been in this weather? Frightening the polar bears. [CABLE SNAPPING] Radio tower has fallen outside. -Flashlights! -[SPEAK|NG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] MAN: Quick. Let's check over here, eh? It sounded like the roof. Nothing over here. The radio mast is down! Lechinski! Oh, Jesus! Get Dr Lindquist. -He's had it. -No, he hasn't. A cutter. We need a plain cutter. And get the doctor. Bring some lights. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Mr Smith, can you help, please? LANSING: What are you giving him? LINDQUIST: Adrenaline. LECHINSKI: Gold. Treasure. [WHEEZING] Coming back into Germany. Worldwide network. Zelda controls it. Who is Zelda? Using it to wreck economy. LANSING: Who is Zelda? I don't think he'll recover consciousness. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] The research boat's gone. -Broken adrift? -No, somebody took it. They got to be crazy with this kind of weather. Head back to camp. Has he spoken again? No. Somebody's taken the research boat. How can you get to the NATO base? I'll try tomorrow morning. LANSING: I wonder who he is. Wonder how he got on to Zelda. SMITHY: Oh, no! What the hell's wrong now? The damn cold outside must be affecting the generator. Where's Jungbeck? He should go and check it. I haven't seen him since this morning. Well, someone must check that generator. Okay. I'll go take a look at it. It'll cost you, though. A double scotch, from each one of you. Wake up. Something's gone wrong with the lights. Keep an eye on Lechinski. Has anybody gone to check the generator? Smithy's gone. -On his own? -Yeah. Frank, I'll come with you. The genny door is open. Something's wrong. [ALL SCREAMING] What happened? -You all right, Tommy? -A|do. Otto? -Otto! -What the hell happened down there? -Is he... -Otto? Dr Lindquist. Dr Lindquist. Come, check his heart. Try and sit down, Tommy. Come on, sit up. Okay, right. They're hurt. Come on. Frank! Frank! Right there! Come quick! -Can you stand up? -Carefu|. OKZY- What happened? Smithy. Smithy was in that hut. -|nto the hut. -|'m going. Come on, Inge, move, move! Frank, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. But the bloody food store's on fire. -Somebody help me with these doors. -Stig? We've got to block the windows or we'll all freeze to death. -Tommy, the windows. Use the cushions. -Yeah, right. I'll get the ping pong tables. Somebody get some light. There's an oil lamp in the kitchen. I know where it is. I'll get it. Hurry UP- I've looked there. Try upstairs. Inge, bring some pillows from the office. What was it? What caused it? You don't know, Professor? Frank, the corridor is filling with snow. -Get the bedding out of every room. -Right. [EXCLAIMING] The end rooms are filling with snow. Get your mattresses and your blankets and bring them in here. It's the only way we're gonna keep warm. Stop it! Stop it! Why are we all pretending? What happened out there, that was no accident. She's right. The generator was blown up. -Deliberately. -What do you mean? I mean, somebody in this room is trying to kill us because of the fortune and gold on this island. It was left here by the Nazis when they failed to get it off at the end of the war. NATO closed the island off and now the Nazis are using this expedition to try again. Nazis? -Here? -You better believe it. -Who are they? -I only know two of them. [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] What? What is he talking about, Professor? Surely you don't think that, Mr Lansing... He's got a gun! Don't move! Stayjust as you are. Frank, search them. Gentlemen, arms up, please. Aldo. Where shall we put them? The store room's got a lock on it. Good. Gentlemen, please, this way. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Tommy! Take the first watch. You'll be replaced in two hours. Okay, Doctor. I'll take the first watch. Get a couple of hours sleep. Zelda's bound to make his move sometime tonight. [SPEAKING IN POLISH] Don't move. Don't move. Keep him conscious. The pain should end quickly. [MUMBLING IN POLISH] Speak English. Who is Zelda? [SPEAKING IN POLISH] English. [GROANS] He's dead. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] There's no way through, Frank. Look at that. There has to be a way through there somehow. Are you going to take the hydrocopter? No, the scooters. That way we can get higher up into the mountains before we have to start climbing. I couldn't climb those faces. Heddi and I are going. Tommy, get the skis, will you? Aldo, the scooter's ready? Frank. Is it really necessary for Dr Lindquist to go? Yes. I trust her. Wouldn't it be better to take the rifle? You're right. Here. You keep this. Will you get the rifle for me, please? This is madness, Doctor. You will never get through those mountains. The research boat is gone, Professor. There's no food, no heat. Somebody has to go. Okay? Good luck, Frank! This should do. [sun-nus] You didn't think I was really gonna make you cross those mountains, did you? I didn't know what you were up to. We're gonna find out who Zelda is. Why? Do you think he's gonna follow us? He'll have to. We'll ambush him right here. I came to take my turn on guard and found him lying there. Somebody let them out. [HYDROCOPTER ENGINE STARTING] Frank! That's enough. Let's get undercover. We'll wait. It's emPiY- My God! It's Paul Hartman. We're going back. We'll lead them back to the ambush place. [SCREAMS] Hurry UP- [GROANING] [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] Hartman hasn't come here. Do you think they moved the gold to the boat yesterday? LANSING: Before the blizzard. I'll go down and check and see if it's there. Find someplace and hide yourself. SMITHY: "And when he got there, the cupboard was bare." My God! Smithy, I thought you'd been killed in that blast. You can't be one of them. [SIGHS] Not me. Oh, no. I'm strictly private enterprise. The gold. I was just a kid diving for the Navy when I found my way in here. Like you did. There I was just asking to be liberated. Naturally, I went back and reported that the entrance was completely sealed. The radio mast. You did that. I couldn't let you contact NATO, now could I, pal? You killed Lechinski. -He's dead? -Yeah. Damn. Sorry about that. I really am. -He was just unlucky. -He got in the way. Then you nearly blew us all up with the generator. You're no better than the rest of them. No, no, no. I didn't do that. That baby was ticking toward zero when I went in there, into that hut. Then when the big bang came, hell, I figured it was the perfect time for me to disappear. And get your gold. Wrong. Jungbeck and Heyter must have loaded it on the research boat just before the blizzard started. Jungbeck and Heyter are dead. -What? -Hartman is Zelda. Smithy, together, you and I could... Sorry, pal. It just wouldn't work. You're too damn honest. Turn around. Come on. Sorry, pal. I can't find Otto anywhere. Paul Hartman is gone, too. LINDQUIST: The hydrocopter's behind the last hut. Otto! Hey, Tommy, footprints. Somebody's gone over to the harbour. Looking for your storm troopers? Jungbeck and Heyter have been working for you all along. They found the U-boat just as you had predicted. We couldn't have done it without your expedition, Otto. The party will always be grateful. I'm taking you back to the camp. That came from the harbour. No point waiting any longer, Zelda. Your two friends won't be showing up. Now, turn around. Come on. Put your hands on those boxes. Put it out! Won't be needing that any longer. And hold it right there. [BOAT STARTING] Hey, where do you think you're going? Hold it! It's Smithy! Back inside. Come on. The professor's been hurt. Take the wheel. Keep that speed. Something's happened to the professor. Something's happened to the professor. He's over by the supply dock. I'll be damned. It's Lansing. -|t's Lansing. Open her up. -I can turn around him. I said, "Open her up." Lose him. Faster! Come on! You can do better than that. Lansing? Lansing! I know you can hear me. Listen to me, Lansing. You're intelligent. You can understand. What I am doing is not for myself, but what I believe in. Lansing, that gold belongs to The Reich. All I want is to get it away without any trouble. I don't wish you any harm. I'll prove it to you, Frank. I'm coming out, unarmed. Unarmed, Lansing. You can trust me. Lansing? Lansing? Lansing? You see, unarmed, as I promised. You and I can trust each other, Lansing. Smith was just a fortune hunter, but you can understand. Ionly ask... [SCREAMING] "Captain Lansing and his crew "persisted in their refusal to hand over the gold "to Nazi party officials. "They were therefore excecuted at 0700 hours this morning. "The gold will be transfered as soon as the present air raid is over." It is signed by the Senior SS Officer. The last entry in his log book.
