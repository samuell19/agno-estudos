VO - "Let me be that I am and not seek to alter me." Hmmm. Your first assignment in English 101 will be to read Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and discuss a time in your life that resembled five act structure. VO - Much Ado is about Hero and Claudio two young lovers who play matchmaker to their friends Beatrice and Benedict but Don John tries to ruin everyone's lives by tricking Claudio into believing that Hero loves another man. What are you writing about Celeste? I can't think of anything. I think I'm going to write about how Much Ado About Nothing reminds me about life in Middle School. You know, people fall head over heels in love with someone just to fall in love with someone else the next day. People spread lies about you to destroy your life because they're jealous of you. You'll pretend to be someone you're not just to escape from bullies. Your friends turn out to be your enemies and your enemies turn out to be your friends. Yeah, I can see that. Why didn't I think of that. VO - There is good advice in the words that Shakespeare wrote "Let me be that I am and not seek to alter me." My dad told me something like that my first day of middle school. "Be yourself and everything will be just fine." I tried to listen to him, but it's not always that simple. I had to learn it the hard way. My first year of middle school was a lot like Much Ado About Nothing. There were times of tragedy and times of comedy twists and turns and surprises I could've never predicted at the start of the year. Such is Much Ado About Nothing. And such was my Shakespeare School Year Hey guys, how were your summers? Oh Celeste, you won't believe the shoes I bought this summer. There a little too dressy for school, but I'll definitely wear them to the first dance. Oh Danielle, we finally get school dances. I know, it's gonna be great! Especially since Zach Johnson and I started going out this summer. So, did you do anything interesting this summer? Not much, I went to the beach for a few weeks- Oh sounds interesting... Well at least you're back at school now and you can hang out with your friends. Good morning. If you would, please have a seat on the floor. Thank you. Hi! My name is Mr. Anderson and... I am your PE teacher. Let me be the first welcome you to Messina Ridge Middle School. I have a very strict policy on rule breaking. The first time it happens I give you a warning The second time it happens, I send you to the principal's office No exceptions! Alright! Since this is your first day here at school I have something very special planned for you I'm gonna let you play basketball So... Go, just go have some fun. I said have fun! Go have fun! Hey! You're pretty good. What are you doing around here this time of day Ain't you supposed to be in school? I'm just running a little late this morning I'm Charlie, what's your name? Ashton Harrell. You know I'm into music too, but I'm more of a singer. Maybe sometime we can get together and jam. Okay sir. Sir, what this sir stuff all about. Call me Charlie. Sir makes me feel old. Okay. Charlie. Ain't you supposed to go to school. You don't want to turn out like me do you? No sir. Then you better get on. Go on, take care. Hey, careful! Be careful! Hey! Hello. What's your name? Ashton Harrell Well, try not to be late to my class again. Ashton Harrell, if that is your real name. Next time you step outta line, I'm sending you to the principal's office understand? Alright, go play some basketball. No. No. No. That is not how you play basketball. Put him down! Thanks loser! That was mine. You can't have it. What are you gonna do about it? Take it away from me? Come on let's go play some ball. You know you shouldn't let him talk to you like taht. Well, you saw what he did. Do I have much of a choice. Hi! I'm Celeste. I've known him for years. He used to be nice, but now he's just a jerk. Well he is the captain of the football team. That still doesn't give him the right to treat you like that. What are you two standing around talking about. You're supposed to be playing basketball. Now get out there and have some fun! Hey Celeste. Hey Zach I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime and you know hang out or something. Zach, I've known you for a long time, but Come on, it'll be fun. We'll just hang out as friends. I don't think I can, I mean, we're friends and all, but Danielle and I are friends too And I know y'all are going out. I really don't think it's right of you to ask me this. Whatever. Hey Celeste. Don't you think that me and Zach make a great couple? Don't you? Sorry what? Don't you think me and Zach make a great couple? Yeah Danielle, I definitely do. I gotta go, I have to get ready for class. You'll text me tonight, right? Of course I will! Hello? Ashton, honey I am so sorry to call you this late. I can't pick you up. Can you get a ride home. Uhhh - no I don't think so. But I guess I could walk home. Of course you can. I'll see you later, love you. Love you too. Aww, widdle Ashton woves his mommy. I'm surprised you aren't sucking on your thumb you little baby. You know what? Just shut up. What did you say to me? I said shut up. Wait Zach, wait - Prinicpal! Ashton! Ashton! I'll see you at school tomorrow, and I might just have to teach you a little respect. Hey! What are you kids doing hanging around this theater? I could ask you the same question? Why don't you go and get yourself a job? What did you say? You ain't nothing but a bum. Go on get outta here. I think you ought to leave son. Where am I? Oh well, at least I'm safe in here. I can't stand him. Zach thinks he's so much better than everyone else, just because he plays sports. So what he can throw a football big deal. I'm bet I'm good at a lot of things Zach isn't. The smile on my face is there to hide. The loneliness that I feel inside. Why can't everybody see. It ain't easy being me. I pretend everything is okay. But I look myself in the mirror each day. I tell myself that they can't see. It ain't easy being me. Why can't I just be myself? Why do I have to be someone else. Maybe one day the world will see. I just wanna be me. No one said that life was fair. But I hate my clothes and I hate my hair. Maybe one day the world will see. It ain't easy beingme. I just want to be me. Just like the beginning of a Shakespeare play, the first act of my year had started. The first act is called Exposition. We meet all the characters and time and place are established. The exposition of Much Ado introduces Hero and Claudio and their friend and the evil Don John. This is a lot like my first day of middle school. We met all the people who would populate our little world for the net year. We met those who would be our friends, crushes and our antagonists. But we didn't always know who that was at the time. Hey Ashton. I think we have some unfinished business. Meet me in the bus lot. 15 minutes. You better be there. What was that all about? Nothing. Zach just wanted to talk to me. What did he say? He wants me to meet him in the bus lot, to fight. Ashton, you don't have to do that. I do! I need to stand up to him. You don't need to prove yourself to him. Not to him, but to myself. I know this sounds crazy, but I gotta do this. I just have to do this. Now, here's the thing I don't really want to fight Zach I mean, who would. He must work out like everyday. But if I don't, he'll just make my life miserable forever. And on top of that the whole school will think I'm afraid or something. So, at least if I get beat up, then everyone will know I stood up to him, right? Hey Ashton! I thought you would chicken out. Look Zach, is there anyway we can talk this out? Let me think. No. Agh. I'll get you for that. Now you're gonna pay. Zach. Ashton. What are you two doing? Put that thing away. Alright, you just earned yourself a trip to the prinicpal's office. Come back here, young man. Oh no. You're not gonna get away with the silent treatment Alright. Just tell me what happened. It's no big deal. Well it was a bit enough deal for the principal to call me away from work. But I wasn't doing anything wrong. Then why did she want to send you home? I don't know. Well, I do Ashton. It's just that I"m having a hard time picturing it. You, in the school bus lot fighting with another boy? It wasn't my fault. he made me fight him. Ashton, no one can make you fight them. You can always choose to walk away. But it's not like that. Well it looks like that to me. Ashton there are rules in place. Fighting is totally unacceptable. But I- There's no buts Ashton. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ground you. No TV, no earbuds. And no texting. Give me your phone. Do you understand? Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that. Yes, ma'am. That's better. Oh, look at the time. Well you'll have plenty of it today to finish your homework. So, what's going on with you and Celeste? Um, I... She... I She was asking me out. I was really surprised. Well I'm sure Danielle will be excited to know that you had nothing to do with this. Nothing to do with it at all. Alright, see you. I can't believe it. My best friend Celeste is trying to steal my boyfriend. Make that ex-best friend. I'll show her to mess with me. Or my Zach. What are you going to do to her Danielle? I don't know. Public embarrassment usually works best, don't you think What are you thinking of, starting a rumor. No, I wouldn't start a rumor. I'm just going to tell everyone the truth about her. I'm going to make sure she never messes with me again. Hey Becca. Hey Celeste. I need to tell you - This is so weird. I can't figure out why no one will speak to me all the sudden. I think I may know. What is it? I overheard Danielle planning to start a rumor about you or something. Hey Danielle, is it true that you started a rumor about me? What? No. I just explained to everyone the truth about you. You're a boyfriend stealer, I guess no one wants to talk to you know, they're probably too afraid you'll steal their boyfriend, like you did with me. But Danielle, I wasn't trying to do anything to you and Zach. Zach asked me out. Oh please, I can't believe you think I'm such an idiot. What about you? Whose side are you on? I'm with Celeste. You'd be willing to give up everything for her. You said you were my friend. Well that can't be true. Cause the lies that you tell. When my back's turned on you. I can't believe you turned out this way. You're just a friend to my face. We have grown apart. Gone our separate ways. Yeah, but that's no excuse. For the things that you say. I can't believe you think that I'm that way. You're just a friend to my face. I can't believe that I've been so betrayed. You're just a friend to my face. So um, what happened between you two for Danielle to get into such a... Zach asked me out I said no, but Danielle must have read something else into it. Or that weasel Zach could've told him that you were the one asking him out. Uh Celeste. Come on, let's get outta here. Come on. In here. Wow, look at this place. Is anybody here? Woah. Don't be scared, it's just me, Charlie. It's okay, I don't bite. You scared us to death. What are you doing here? Well, I hang around here. Isn't it hard, you know, living here all by yourself? I been hanging around this old theater for many years. Sometimes it does get hard. Sometimes people throw rocks at the windows. Make noises. Probably Zach. But yesterday I'd had someone come inside the theater in a long time. A young boy your age, came in and sang a song He couldn't see me, but I could sure hear him. This other kid was yelling at him, chasing him I believe. Now that definitely sounds like Zach. He was probably chasing Ashton. Yeah Ashton. That does sound familiar. I believe I met him on the street the other day. But I didn't know he sang. If that's him, he could sing. I hear him. Wow. Never would've guessed. You should never judge a book by its cover. You never really no somebody until you know somebody. Celeste. Is everything alright? Yeah, everything is fine. No, everything is not alright. What's the matter baby? I hate school. I hate everything. Is this about your father and I? No. Well.. yes, but it's more about my friends and school and everything else. Oh sweetie. I think that this is just a natural thing. And you've been through a lot this past year. And I'll tell you the truth... Middle school is no easy thing. It was hard for me, and it'll be hard for you, but it's just something you have to go through. But you don't understand. You couldn't understand. Okay then... I'll leave. Shakespeare said "friendship is constant in all other things. That's what Becca was for me. The only real friend I had... What's the sheet say about Act II. After making it through the inciting incident. the second act of the play starts. The second act of a Shakespeare play is referred to as the rising action or complication. Well in the second act of Much Ado, things definitely seem more complicated. Don John arranges details so that it appears that Hero is in love with another man and Claudio refuses to marry her. Instead, he tries to publicly embarrass her. So what embarrassing middle school moment are you going to choose? Well after Danielle banished me from her clique, things in middle school got incredibly complicated for me. I was balancing school work and falling in love with the idea of the old capital theater. VO - In Shakespeare's comedies, the climax often seems like tragedy. In Much Ado, Hero and Claudio think that their lives are ruined. Just like the characters in Much Ado, things were building in my life and I couldn't see that tragedy was just around the corner. Hey Ashton. Have you ever been in the old Capitol Theater? Yeah, have you? We found it yesterday, when we were hiding from Danielle. We're going to start meeting there after school to do music, dance, whatever we want. Well, I've been grounded for fighting in schoo. You should be able to convince your grandmother that you've joined a club she won't stop you from attending meetings. And the best part is, no one else knows about the theater. Actually, someone else does know about the theater. His name's Charlie. What the bum that lives on main street? Charlie's homeless. He lives in the theater. I never knew that. Okay, so, we're going to meet at the Capitol Theater after school, right? The capitol theater? I haven't heard that name in years. Oh, that was a great plac.e I remember the good old days when that theater was brand new. Well, what happened to it. It's said that old man Spencer just let go of it after his wife died. They say he just gave up on it. But why? Ah. That's the real mystery. He always seemed to just love that theater, doesn't make sense. It never did. Now I suppose we'll never know. What happened to him? Oh, no one has seen him in years. They say he doesn't ever leave his house any more. Well that's a good thing, cause he'll never find out we're using his theater. Excuse me, I do have to take this. Hello? Oh Ashton, are you alright? Hey, I wanted to call you. I was wondering if I could stay late for a club this afternoon? Well I think that would probably be alright. A club would be good for you. I want you home though, by six Perfect. Alright hon, I'll see you. Bye. Well, well, well Look who's come back to my home. The three stooges. Now that you're all here together, why don't you sing something. But we don't know anything. Well then I'll start. Hey Ashton, we're calling you out. We want to know what you are all about. I can make any song sound rock and roll So give me a beat boys and I'll be ready to go. Hey Celeste, we're calling you out, we want to know what you are all about. I can sing country with a lot of soul So give me a beat boys and I'll be ready to go. You're kinda country, I'm down with that And a rockin guitar is where you're at Music brings us together don't you know. So give us a beat boys and we'll be ready to go. Good news What is it dad? My company's got another job. We're bring a new strip mall in town. Dad that's great. It'll be nice to have a place to shop for a change. We actually won't start building it until the spring. Cause we have to tear down some other buildings first. You know where the old capital theater is? What's wrong? That's not one of the buildings you're tearing down, is it? Yes it is, why? I like that theater. I thought you said it would be nice to do some shopping for a change. But the theater's a landmark. It's been here forever. Well, this spring it's going to be a new strip mall. No dad, don't take the job. Sweetie, we already have, besides even if we didn't, it would just go to the next higher bidder anyway. Meet me at the theater. At 12. SOS. We've got problems. What is it Celeste. I'm tired. They're going to tear down the theater. What? Who? My dad's building company. They're making a new strip mall. They can't. When are they planning on doing this? Next spring. What? You have us sneak out of our houses and come down here, when we have until spring to figure something out? Do you know how much trouble I could get into? If my grandmother finds out- I know! But we need to start thinking and I thought you'd want to know this immediately. Yeah, we need to start planning now. Maybe we can figure out a way to stop this. We can't let this project go through. We just have to do something. Hey, let's just ask Charlie. I bet he'll know what to do. Yeah, you're right, we should tell him. Charlie. Charlie. That's weird. I wonder where he is. Somehow it seems a little more scary at night. I hope he's okay. Maybe we should go look for him. Ashton, we need to go now. Okay, we'll go, just one more minute. Charlie. Are you here? What's that? I don't know. Ashton, I don't think that's such a good idea. Shh- I wonder who she is. She's beautiful. I bet that's old man Spencer's wife. Maybe. I wish we could find Charlie. It would make me feel better to know he's safe. Me too, but I think it's time for us to get home. I don't feel safe anymore. Yeah, you guys are right. Let's get outta here. So that was that. The theater was going to be torn down. At the time we thought it was the end of the story. It was all tragedy. Listen, I think your paper's gonna be fine, but what you effectively need to do is compare the last two acts of Much Ado with your life as you remember it The fourth act of the play is referred to as the Falling Action The conflict begins to get resolved. Professor, that is exactly like my life in middle school After we found out the theater was going to be destroyed, Ashton, Becca, and I teamed up to try and fix the problem that had been handed to us. Even though the odds were against us, we didn't give up. Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing, right? So write it down, I can't wait to read it. We've got some bad news for you. My dad told me his building company's gonna tear down the theater to make way for a strip mall. Really. Now I know that can't be true. I used to know Mr. Spencer the man that owns this theater. He loves this old thing. He sure doesn't take good care of it. No. Come on guys, we need to get to school, or else we're gonna be late. Bye Charlie. Bye! Hey, I wonder if Charlie is right and Mr. Spencer does love the theater, maybe we can convince him not to tear it down. Maybe he just thinks that no one else cares about the theater. We'll go talk to him after school. Richard I need those reports after lunch, if you don't have them done by then, don't even worry about coming back to work. Yes sir... Lucy, I don't want to be bothered, okay. Okay Mr. Spencer, sir. Morning Jack! Morning Frank. Have you thought any more about my proposal? Yes, I have and there are a few more things I'd like to talk about- That's great, I want to do everything to get the ball rolling on this project. How soon do you think we can start getting things ready? We're going to begin heavy demolition no later than the earliest part of spring. If that's the best you can do. Jack, we've got to wait until after Christmas. There's no way we can start construction until after the winter passes anyway. But I assure you, I am going to complete this project to your utmost satisfaction as soon as I possibly can. That's fine Frank. Thank you. Hello James. Hello Mr. Spencer. Your father had to step out, but he should be back at any time now. Come on in. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Well it's better than doing nothing, right? James. James. Hello. If you're selling something for school I'm not interested. No sir, we're not trying to sell you anything. Well then, what do you want? We're here to talk to Mr. Spencer about the Capitol Theater on main street. Oh yeah, what about? Sir, we heard the theater in town is going to be torn down. How did you find out about that? Nevermind how we found out. We just don't want the theater to get destroyed. Look, this project is confidential. Now I don't know how you the three of you found out about it but I'd advise you not to talk about it. Mr. Spencer, I know this deal means a lot to you, but the theater means a lot to us and to other people in the town. Maybe we could raise enough money to buy it from you. Ha. That's impossible. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing you can do to stop this deal. Sorry. Have a nice day. We will find a way to stop the theater from getting torn down. That's great kid. Why don't you see me once you've raised some money. I told you it wasn't going to work. It was a good plan. Well I wish it would've worked, if not for us, for Charlie. Where will he go once the theater's knocked down. What are we talking about, listen to ourselves, we've already given up. There's not much more we can do is there? Mr. Spencer told us to come back when we had money. So, let's see what we can do between now and Christmas. Hey, I asked you kids to leave! You actually have a piggy bank? Well, I've had it since I was a kid, and really don't want to break it. Do you want to save the theater or not? Okay, here it goes. I just can't do it. Fine then, I'll do it. Well, looks like you've got $152.23 Well, we just have to keep working. I guess I can mow some lawns We can ask around for donations. Let's just face it guys, it's still not going to be enough money. Well, let's see what we can do. Good afternoon Jack. How are you? I'm well, how are you? Same. Now what is it that you need? Always down to business, Jack? I was just like you when I was your age. Let me give you a piece of advice. You need to slow down a bit You'll look back one day and wish you had spent more time enjoying your life. Yeah. Now you mentioned something about the finances. Well, my lawyers have been urging me to transfer control of all my assets to you Because, well, I am getting old. Well, I've thought about, but well considering that I'm still alive and well and quite active if I do say so myself. I've decided to keep control of everything, for now. That's great. Is that all you wanted from me. Yes, that's it. I did hope that we could get a chance to talk some though. I'd love to dad, but I've got to get back to work. I see. I'll talk to you soon. Alright. Hey Ashton, I'm surprised you're here. I didn't even think you knew what a girl was. So what, you're here alone? No, he's here with me. Hey Celeste. Hey Zach, what are you doing all the way over here? I was just seeing how this couple was doing. They seem pretty happy don't you think? I can't stand them. They think they're so much better than everyone else. I can not believe I used to be friends with her. Hey guys, sorry I'm late. So did the play go well? Yeah, it was a packed house. I've got it. I think I've got a way we can save the theater? What is it Celeste? I can't believe I didn't think of it before. We need to hold a play. Sell tickets, fix up the theater. We should be able to raise enough money to at least attract Mr. Spencer's attention. Celeste, that's a great idea! Merry Christmas, Charlie! We've got a present for you. Oh. It's not much. Thank you, thank you very much! Look at that. Any luck, raising money? Not much, but I think we've got an idea. That's great. Tell me about it. We're going to fix up the theater and hold a play. We hope we can raise enough money to catch Mr. Spencer's attention. That's a very good idea. What play are you going to do? We haven't thought that far ahead yet. You know I was here when they did the first play. Want to know what it was? Tell us! Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. Ugh. Shakespeare. It wasn't so bad, especially if you could understand what they were saying. Yeah, let's do a modern day version and we could put music and dance in it There you go, I like that. But Shakespeare? Quiet down everybody. Hello everybody, hope everybody's doing okay this morning. Late again, Mr. Jeremy. Time for morning announcements. Let's watch. Hey guys, you need to look at this. This is the capitol theater. It's the oldest theater in town. Yeah it's going to be knocked down to make way for a strip mall. I know it doesn't mean a lot to you but it means a lot to us and the people of this town, so we're trying to save this landmark and we can't do it alone. Yeah, we need your help. Just come talk to us if you'd like to help us. We need all the help we can get. What are you three doing here? Yeah, why don't you just get out of here. Look, I can understand why you don't want us here. But I just came to tell Celeste that I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I know, I'm just sorry about the way I acted earlier this year. I didn't know Zach was such a jerk. Yeah he can get kinda weird sometimes. Well, I guess we should go. Wait you guys. It's fine. You can stay. Right now, we need all the help we can get. Right guys? Hey Ashton, heard about your stupid little play. I thought I'd come down here and see what was going on. Why don't you just leave. Nobody wants you here. So you guys actually want to save this piece of trash. Pretty sad. It's a part of this town. Yeah. A part that needs to be destroyed. We're going to make sure that doesn't happen. I can't believe you have sunk this low. Hanging out with them, you had it so good with me. Why don't you just get out of here. I would, but I know something no one else does. I know that you guys have been sneaking in here illegally and to top that off, my dad knows Mr. Spencer I could have your little play shut down. No, you can't Not after all the hard work we've put into this play. I can, and I will. What are you going to do about it, cry to your mommy? You better not do anything to shut our play down. Or it's the last thing you'll do. You'll be sorry you did this! Come here guys you won't believe this! Wow. This should definitely help raise enough money. Ruth, I want you to guard the front do you understand me? Do not let Mr. Spencer through Stall him any way you can. Yes sir. Let's go do this. Welcome to Much Ado About Middle School Thank you so much for coming, we hope you enjoy the show. Gonna tell you a story you might have read about two young lovers before they were wed. It a story that's been told a thousand ways so we put it to our own beat if that's okay. My name's Claudio, but call me Chris and I'm all set for romantic bliss. There's a big dance coming and I'm ready to go. With my new girlfriend, she's Hero. My name's Hero I'm queen of the dance and I like to get involved with everybody's romance here at school you may think she's chillin' but my friend Pricilla is nothing but a villain. I like to get down and plot and plan I've got a new scheme to steal me a man I'm gonna trick Chris with the help of my friends let's get this party started and see how it ends. So sit right back, get ready to go cause the No Limit Kids are gonna put on a show It's a Shakespeare story we think is cool, we call it. Much Ado About Middle School. Celeste, get to the stage, your scene's up. Pricilla, How are you today? Oh Hero, I'm fine. I hope you and Chris are happy together. We are. He's taking me to the big dance this Friday. That's wonderful. I have to go. I have homework to do. Goodbye. I need to find a way to break them up. They are too happy together I know what I'll do. I'll make Chris believe that Hero loves someone else. Hey Brandon, I've got a trick to play on Chris. Do you think that you could make it look like Hero is in love with you? Yeah, I could probably do that. Maybe we could pretend that Margaret is Hero and you can make sure that Chris is watching. Margaret does look an awful lot like Her. I'll go find Chris, you find Margaret. Woah sir, we're all sold out. Kid, I own this theater. Hero, I have something to say. What is it Chris? We need to see other people. Why? I saw you with Brandon the other day. Pricilla told me all about it. I never. Kid I'm warning you. Back off. But, the fire marshal said we can't have one more person in here. Chris, have you heard, Hero's run away from home. Really? I don't care. Aren't you worried about her? Hello, yes. Can I have a police officer at 364 Main Street. Thank you. Let's just see how this works out. I can't believe we actually pulled that off. I mean Chris really believed that Margaret was Hero. Thanks so much for helping me break them up. Hey Chris, you'll never believe this, but Hero never loved Brandon. It was all a trick by Pricilla. What, then she's run away for nothing. What have I done. Chris wait, stop. Stop! Stop! Hold everything! This play is now canceled. I am sorry folks, but this theater was broken into and used by these children without my permission. Mr. Spencer, the only reason we held this play is so we could raise enough money to buy the theater from you. We just wanted to save it from destruction. A noble idea. But nonetheless, this theater is going to be destroyed. The plans have already been set into motion. Now if everyone could please leave Woah! This theater is not going to be torn down. Jack, what are you doing? I- I don't know what you're talking about. That's Charlie. We only wanted to save the theater for him. Charlie. Charles Spencer, the rightful owner of this theater. You can't be Charles Spencer, he was a very wealthy man. Yeah, I've seen you lurking around this theater for years. You're nothing but a homeless bum. So, we had lost. We couldn't save Charlie's home. The defining moment came and we dropped the ball. So in Much Ado, Hero tries to fake her own death to see if Claudio really loves her or not. So what did you do? Did you save the theater. I'm getting there. All seems lost for Claudio when Hero dies. He's challenged to a duel by Hero's angry friends and relatives. It seems like he's facing certain death. But the theater! I said I'm getting there. In Much Ado there's an Act 5. Hero's not really dead, Don John's tricks are revealed to a night watchman who exposes him to Don Pedro. There's a final act to my story too! Oh my gosh, it's getting late... Finish the story. I'll have to finish it tomorrow. I need to go to bed. Celeste come on! Good night, good night, parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say goodnight til it be morrow. I'll take it from here. Jack I can't believe you would go behind my back and try to destroy something that was dear to me. And dear to your mother. But dad, I - Your mother built this place before I even met her She was trying to build something that the whole community could enjoy. And you would go behind my back and try to destroy that? Just look at yourself, after mom died, you quit caring about everything. You let the theater go you let your business go, you let me go. You're right, I haven't been a good father. But this place is a wreck, a piece of junk, an eyesore to this whole community. You didn't even care enough about it to keep it up. Nah, you just let it all go. Jack, you've been wrong about a lot of things. But you're right about that. I have let this place go. I let you go. When your mother passed, I lost interest in everything. It was hard to be around you for the same reason. In fact, it was hard to be Charles Spencer. That's why I took to being Charlie. I don't know why, but it made it easier to face this town. Being someone else, made it easier to forget the past. I guess that's what made it so hard Finally found my way back to the theater, and you come along behind my back and try to destroy it. I knew you loved this theater, but I didn't understand why it meant so much to you. I should have told you I should have been there for you. I'm sorry son. I let you down. I cannot believe you would do something like this! Let's see, breaking and entering, damage to private property trespassing, I don't even know where to begin. Don't you have anything to say for yourselves? We just wanted to save the theater. Save the theater! From what? My project. Didn't you stop to think that maybe we need this business Celete? Come on in. Excuse me. Charlie! Yeah, I'm man that you know as Charlie. But actually my name is Charles Spencer. Mr. Spencer, they are very sorry for the way that they have acted and they will never go near your theater again. Oh, that won't be necessary. I have no reason to keep them away. I'm very sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I might speak to the kids for just a moment. Certainly. You all did a wonderful job with the play tonight. In fact, I see the same passion for the theater that my wife had, in all of you. She loved the theater, maybe more than me. So I'm gonna give the theater to you. I know that you'll take care of it in the same way that my wife would've wanted me to. Thank you so much Mr. Spencer! Frank, I understand you were gonna be the foreman of the job my son was putting together. Yes sir, that's correct. I have another job for you, if you're interested. The theater's looking a little ragged on the outside, and the inside. No offense to you kids, you did a great job cleaning it up. Mr. Spencer, I would be honored. Well, you kids stay out of trouble. So that was Act 5. The Resolution. The happily ever after, if you will. Act 5 is where everything is wrapped up and the characters' lives are better off than they were when the story began. To borrow another Shakespeare quote. "The wheel has come full circle." In Much Ado, Hero is revealed to be alive she and Claudio are married, and Don John is captured. The play ends on an extreme high. This is the same as our lives in Middle School. The year started out and we didn't know what to expect. We had conflict, drama, we had ups and downs. We had to deal with bullies who wanted to ruin our lives just because we were happy and they were not. But ultimately, life in middle school was a comedy. Shakespeare's comedies weren't always funny, but the character's lives turned out alright in the end. Shakespeare said in another play "To thine own self be true." Charlie knew that, and that's what he taught us. It's the same message in Much Ado About Nothing. "Let me be that I am and not seek to alter me." Good advice for anyone in middle school Looking out across the water. Some days it seems so high. But if we hold tight to each other. We'll wind up on the other side. There's no limit if we can dream it and do our best to achieve. There is much more than we can hope for if we only believe, there's no limit. to your dreams. Now the mountain before us Sometimes it seems to high. But when we're leaning on each other. There's no mountain we can't climb. There's no limit if we can dream it and do our best to achieve. There is much more than we can hope for. If we only believe There's not limit. To your dreams.
