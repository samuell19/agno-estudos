Rettenberger! Adapted from Martin Prinz's novel Based on a true story THE ROBBER The big question: What are your plans? Do you have any goals for afterwards? I'll take things as they come. Are you happy to be getting out? Sure. That's good. Not everybody is. It even scares some people. What are you looking forward to? Not running in circles anymore. Early on you tried to escape twice. That wasn?t just to commit another robbery, was it? You won't find the freedom you're looking for here, no matter how long you run around the courtyard. And you won't find it outside either... if you don't work for it. You won't make much money running. What do you think? What do I think? I haven't needed help for six years, I don't need any now. OK, this is your room. The bath is in back. Rent's due in advance every week. You replace anything you break. No loud music, no trouble, or I'll have to come up. This opens the front door too. Lose it, and you pay 700 euros. Understand? This is a robbery, let's go! On your knees, on your knees! You there. Put the money in the bags. And we'll all stay nice and calm. Faster! Give me the bag. I picked out some companies for you, they all have experience with ex-cons. You can call them, they know what's up. Don't wait too long, they aren't waiting for you, as you can imagine. I'I bring you some more forms, they're important, and then we'll see what has to be done. Please fill this out, there are tables outside. Mail the birth certificate so you won't have to come back. Thanks, that's nice of you. - My pleasure. You're all grown up. And you, back in the free word? Say it. You look tired. It wasn?t much of a vacation. What are you doing now? Training. You're running again? I never stopped. Erika, can you take this gentleman? I have to run upstairs. Thanks. I have work to do. Can you come to me, please? OK, that's everything. Call me after you talk to one of them and tell me what happened. Thanks. Goodbye. - Bye. Bye. His basic stamina's extremely stable, which indicates good fatty-acid metabolism. If you do some speed runs, build-ups, long and short intervals, your anaerobic level will go up a little more. Not many runners will beat you after that. The 25th Vienna City Marathon has begun. ...and the pursuers are close behind, trying not to fall back. We can see that, the effort... ...the unknown runner, number 8950, that's Johann Rettenberger, ...the runners who fell behind. And no one expected he would be in front, There he is, the best Austrian runner! Ladies and gentlemen, number 8950, Johann Rettenberger, for Austria. He set a fantastic new national record here in Vienna, The prizes are substantial, 5,000 euros for the record, and 10,000 euros for the best first-timer. Congratulations to the marathon organizers, congratulations to Johann Rettenberger, we'll have to remember that name. He started way in back, with the amateurs, and left almost all the top Europeans behind, moving right up to the front. Over 30,000 runners from around the world... took part in the 25th Vienna City Marathon. As we've learned, Johann Rettenberger, who unexpectedly set a new national record here, at Stein Prison. Until recently this native of Lower Austria was serving a sentence for attempted bank robbery. Countries where banks maintain secrecy are still under pressure. The USA forced major Swiss bank UBS.... and opponents of bank secrecy welcomed this. THE GREAT UNKNOWN Just anywhere on the picture. That'll definitely be a great motivation for others. Thanks. I took another look at your file. I always try to do that when someone's so successful. And I concentrate on the environment. You haven't had any contact... with your family for some time. Do you see friends? Or are there any other... runners you train with? No. OK, but is there... anybody you can talk to? No? What happened with your job applications? They didn't fit in with my training program. Coffee? I'd like a small coffee, black. Thank you. Do you have to smoke? Please put it out. - Sorry. It's not good, Mr Rettenberger. Sorry. It's just like what you did in prison, and your life... still seems unstable. In your case I'm not really worried about money. But if one thing goes wrong, you'll fall back into the old ways. I've seen that happen too often. Then we'll see each other in prison again. That won't happen, I can guarantee that. Hi. - Hi. Should I take my shoes off? - No. Just like in the old days. Does your mom still live here? No, she died a year ago. I still haven't changed anything. I'm making coffee. Your mom always had that kind of chocolate. I'm surprised you remember. I even stole some once in a while. - I know. Did Herbert ever come to see you? - No. He lives in M?dling now, with his family. That sounds like him. What are you writing? Something for myself. A diary? No. It's about my family. Follow me. You can have this room. You can stay here until you find your own place. The bathroom's down the hall. Have a look. Move over. Let's go! Don't look at me, hands on your knees. Turn the rad o on! ...threatened employees and customers, took all the cash... Where's the cell phone? - Here. The police has intensified the search. The perpetrator's about 1.80 meters tall, thin, apparently a native Austrian. And drove a dark-blue VW Golf. The police request information from the public. Get out! Shut the door! Just a second. I need the car keys! Thanks. - Thank you. Did you have to wait? No, I would have taken a taxi. Do you want to come along? Can I drive back? Sure. Good night. Night. Well? - We I? Where did you run? O the Husarentempel and then here. Hi. Hi. You were watching us, weren?t you? Jealous? For a second. That's nice. It's something new. Mr Mayor, what's happening now? Things are starting to get under way, I estimate about 50 or 60 masked participants are here, and some floats have arrived. One has Snow White, with Snow White in her coffin and dwarves. And an antique motorcycle is parked in front of the municipal office. And everybody's in a good mood Get out! Dammit! Stop! Finally, we managed to reach you, we found you! And now to the vault! Go, go, go. What are you looking at? Nearly 100,000 euros were taken... during a bank robbery this morning. The masked robber has already hit eight other banks... in Vienna and Lower Austria. Attention, car drivers, at today's soccer match... Put the money in the bags! This is a hold dup! Let's go. On your knees! Everybody keep cool. Faster! What's the matter? Get moving! Come here, come here! Open the door! The key! Put the money in the bags! Everybody stay coo. Let's go. Give me the bag. Give me the bag! The bag! This s a holdup. Move! On your knees. Don't move. Faster. Give me the bags! Go, go, go! Freeze, police! Police! The Masked Man. Series of Bank Robberies Continues. Hi. Put that away! Is that all your life's worth, that little bit of money? What I do has nothing to do with what you call life. And where do I fit in? I didn't expect to meet you. I see. I want you to look for your own place. You can make a choice. I believe that. And if you don't, it says a lot. Mr Rettenberger. Hello. Hello. Congratulations. That was some performance! Have you been training a lot lately? I hoped to see you here. I realize... this might not be the best time, but we have to talk. Mr Rettenberger. Hey! It's been eight weeks. I don't know your address. I don't have the sense that you're cooperating. What should I put in my report? Nothing. Come on, you know that's not possible. Mr Rettenberger! I want you to do your running here and not in a cell. But if you don't cooperate, they'll lock you up again. I can't understand why... you're ruining everything... after so much progress. And I can't keep covering for you. Get lost! Do you know how you got the treadmill in your cell? The warden asked me whether you really need it. And I said, "Yeah, he's serious, he's really training hard." And he understood that. But it could have been completely different. Making decisions like that is difficult. Take jobs for prisoners. We don't have jobs for everyone. At the most, 250 out of 400 prisoners get jobs. That's always the problem, no matter what you decide. It's... How long did Mr Rettenberger live here? About six months. And why did he move out? That was the agreement. Agreement? Do you arrange a certain date? No. Did you throw him out, or did he just leave? Neither. I told him he could stay until... he found something else, and then he moved out. So there was no particular reason... that he left? No. That's what we suspected, in light of the incident with the parole officer. I don't see the connection. A parole officer was killed. In connection with the marathon he ran in. And as you know, when somebody... kills an officer, the police is particularly... aggressive. So he better turn himself in, because any officer who crosses his path... will treat him like a personal enemy. Where are you going? Stop doing that! They know where you are. Go away somewhere. Please, for me. Please, Erika, go now. Go away, please. I'm not scared of you. Stay here. What's that? It's like in my dream. Except the sound's a lot louder, as if someone was kicking down the door. It seems like it's coming from inside. I'm dead, lying in my grave, and I'm so full of energy that I come back to life. Just to resist. Erika, don't stop me. I'm bad luck for you. Police, freeze! He's not injured, he came peacefully. You shouldn't blame yourself. I think he was glad we caught him. You know, the constant tension of being hunted, not knowing what will happen next. No one can take that for long. You did the right thing, believe me. I've been doing this job for a long time. I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. Don't blame yourself, it was the smartest thing to do. You'll see. Read it. If anything's wrong, change it. And when you're done, sign each page. We know that h s habits rare y change. And that's our chance. He won't get far. I don't think so either. The units should cover the area. He'll run out of breath sooner or later. Right flank, move up. Watch your backs. Left flank, move up. Left flank, keep moving. Unit 5, closing the gap. Watch your backs. Sector 2, clear. Unit 4, move on. Right flank follows. Left flank, farther ahead. Good morning. Morning. I need the car. Come on. That's right. In there. Where are you going now? What would you do? Stay in Vienna. Grow a beard. Get a job, someplace where everybody knows you. That's the best way to hide. Watch it, watch it, you... ...can you say about his whereabouts? The man was found tied-up one hour ago. He's not injured. The fugitive overpowered him and fled with his car. I hope you will understand that... I can?t reveal any details. We advise the public to exercise extreme caution... because the fugitive is armed and dangerous. That's the latest on the search, now back to the studio. Austria?s winter athletes have had an especially successful weekend. The male alpine skiers Benjamin Raich and Reinfried Herbst won their events, Christoph Sumann took the Biathlon World Cup, and 19-year-old Gregor Schlierenzauer dominated the Ski Jump World Cup at Kulm. Those were definitely my two most emotional wins for a home crowd, and in the ski jump, what more could I ask for? In just a few minutes we'll take a look at why the young Tyrolean is so successful. The keys. Do you have a cell phone? They're in the car. Get out of here. Your girlfriend's staying with me. Hello. Hi. Erika. Yeah. They can hear you. I don't have much longer now. I love you, Hans. Please don't hang up. Translation: Steve Wilder
